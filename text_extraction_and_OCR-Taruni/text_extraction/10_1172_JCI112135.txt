Abstract
We have previously described a subpopulation of patients with
septic shock who had a reversible depression of radionuclide￾determined left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). To investigate
the mechanism of this myocardial depression, an in vitro model
of mammalian myocardial cell performance was established em￾ploying primary spontaneously beating rat myocardial cells. The
contraction of a single cardiac cell was quantitated by recording
the changes in area occupied by the cell during contraction and
relaxation. In 20 septic shock patients during the acute phase,
the mean left ventricular EF was decreased (mean = 033, normal
mean = 0.50), and serum obtained during this acute phase in￾duced a mean (±standard error of the mean) 33±4% decrease
in extent and 25±4% decrease in velocity of myocardial cell
shortening during contraction (P < 0.001). In contrast, serum
obtained from 11 of these same patients before shock (n = 2)
or after recovery (n = 9) of the left ventricular EF (mean = 0.50)
showed a return toward normal in extent and velocity of short￾ening (P < 0.001). Sera from 17 critically ill nonseptic patients,
from 10 patients with structural heart disease as a cause for a
depressed EF, and from 12 healthy laboratory personnel, induced
no significant changes in in vitro myocardial cell performance.
In 20 patients during the acute phase of septic shock, the de￾creased EF in vivo demonstrated a significant correlation
(r = +0.52, P < 0.01) with a deerease in the extent of myocardial
cell shortening in vitro. The quantitative and temporal correlation
between the decreased left ventricular EF and this serum myo￾cardial depressant substance argues for a pathophysiologic role
for this depressant substance in producing the reversible car￾diomyopathy seen during septic shock in humans.
Introduction
Serious cardiovascular compromise resulting from bloodstream
invasion by microorganisms represents one ofthe most common
life-threatening clinical syndromes in medicine. Shock secondary
to sepsis has been the subject ofan enormous investigative effort
during the past 40 years; however, it remains a common cause
of patient demise (1, 2). The pathogenesis of septic shock is

highly complex, and certain characteristics of this pathogenesis
have led to considerable controversy and confusion regarding
the true mechanisms of the septic shock syndrome.
Approximately 30 years ago, early studies of septic shock
emphasized two distinct clinical syndromes (3). One type had a
bounding pulse ascribed to a high cardiac output; a second syn￾drome was characterized by "cold, clammy" skin and a faint
pulse and this syndrome was postulated to result from a low
cardiac output. This low cardiac output was equated with in￾adequate heart function and was designated the heart failure or
myocardial depression of septic shock (4-6). Because canine en￾dotoxin models produced a low cardiac output, this animal
model was felt to be characteristic of the low output syndrome
(4). However, subsequent studies demonstrated unequivocally
that most patients had a normal or high cardiac output in the
initial phases ofseptic shock (7-15). Thus, if myocardial depres￾sion was indeed a part of septic shock in humans, a low cardiac
output was not a sensitive reflection of cardiac dysfunction.
Recently, noting that the ejection fraction (EF),1 but not
cardiac output, was an excellent predictor of ultimate prognosis
in patients with chronic coronary disease (16), we employed
both the thermodilution cardiac output and the radionuclide￾gated blood pool scan-determined EF in the intensive care en￾vironment, and showed that a significant subpopulation of pa￾tients with moderate-to-severe septic shock demonstrated pro￾found reductions in left ventricular EF and concomitant dila￾tation ofthe ventricle; in patients who survived, this ventricular
dysfunction was found to be reversible during a 7-10-day follow￾up period (17). The cardiac index in these same patients was
either normal (2.5-3.5 liters/min. iM2) or elevated (>3.5 liters/
min* nm2). A previous study had demonstrated that 5 of 20 pa￾tients with sepsis without shock also demonstrated an initial
reduction in left ventricular EF (18). Thus, by employing radio￾nuclide studies along with thermodilution cardiac outputs, ev￾idence of early transient myocardial depression was clearly
demonstrated in humans with septic shock.
The cause of this depressed myocardial performance was
not known. In animal models of hemorrhagic and endotoxic
shock, two suggested mechanisms were a depressed coronary
blood flow or the presence of a circulating myocardial depressant
factor. Employing a thermodilution coronary sinus catheter, we
found no evidence for a decrease in coronary blood flow during
human septic shock (19). Thus, we devised an in vitro model
of myocardial cell performance to evaluate the presence of a
circulating myocardial depressant substance and attempted to
correlate the presence of this in vitro substance with the radio￾nuclide-determined EF, a measure of in vivo myocardial per￾formance. This paper details the results of that study.

< 500 cells/mm3), and a localized site of culture positive infection, but
negative blood cultures that were ascribed to concomitant treatment
with broad-spectrum antibiotics (three patients). The clinical character￾istics of these 20 patients are shown in Table I.
Of the 20 patients with septic shock, 11 patients had serial hemo￾dynamics, serial radionuclide scans, and serial blood drawing to allow
comparison of the acute and recovery (n = 9) or the acute and presepsis
(n = 2) measures of cardiovascular function; these serial tests also allowed
comparison of in vivo cardiovascular function with a measure of in vitro
myocardial cell performance (see below). In 9 of the 20 septic shock
patients, initial hemodynamics and initial blood samples were obtained;
however, serial blood samples were not obtained (due to early death or
due to unavailability of personnel) and the initial values only were an￾alyzed. These nine patients demonstrated similar serial cardiovascular
parameters (i.e., a return to normal EF in survivors) as the 11 patients
(Pl-PI 1) cited above.
Control populations. Three separate control populations (Table II)
were evaluated and compared with the patient population. Blood samples
were obtained from 12 healthy laboratory personnel who were taking
no medications and had no symptoms or signs of any cardiovascular
disease. This control group was assumed to have normal cardiovascular
function. A second control group consisted of 10 patients with chronic
cardiovascular disease that had resulted in a decreased resting EF (<0.45).
These patients were being evaluated electively for their cardiovascular
disease and had no signs of acute illness and no evidence of sepsis. A
third control group consisted of 17 critically ill patients admitted to the
National Institutes of Health Medical Intensive Care Unit for intensive
medical care. None of these patients had known structural heart disease
and none had suspected bacterial or fungal sepsis. All 17 patients had
initial (14 patients had serial) radionuclide-determined EFs in the normal
range (0.45-0.72).
Hemodynamic evaluations. In the patients and the critically ill con￾trols, arterial pressure was monitored by an indwelling arterial catheter
in the radial or femoral artery. A pulmonary artery balloon flotation
catheter was positioned with fluoroscopic guidance in the pulmonary
artery of each patient. Serial measurements (every 6-12 h) of central
venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output
by thermodilution technique were obtained. Cardiac index was the cardiac
output divided by a patient's body surface area. Measurements of pul￾monary capillary wedge pressure were made from tracings on graph paper
at end expiration. In patients on positive end expiratory pressure (see
below), measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were made
at end expiration both on and after 10 s off positive and expiratory
pressure. In the patients in this study, the mean pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure on and off positive end expiratory pressure never differed
by >2 mmHg.
Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and stroke volume index
(SVI) were calculated according to standard formulas: SVRI (dynes * s/
cm-5/m2) = (MAP - CVP) + (CI) X 80, and SVI (ml/beat iM2) = Cl
. HR, where MAP = mean arterial pressure, CVP = central venous
pressure, CI = cardiac index, and HR = heart rate.
Therapeutic protocol. All the patients and any hypotensive critically
ill control patient were treated by the same group ofcritical care physicians
employing the following sequential treatment protocol: the goal was to
maintain a mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg. Initially, all patients re￾ceived intravenous fluids to maintain a pulmonary capillary wedge pres￾sure of 15 mmHg. Dopamine was then added if the patient remained
hypotensive. If the patient required >20 /Ag/kg. min of dopamine, lev￾arterenol was added, and the dopamine was tapered to 2-3 'Rg/kg. min
in an attempt to preserve renal perfusion. All patients received broad￾spectrum antibiotic coverage, usually including an aminoglycoside, a
cephalosporin, and a semisynthetic penicillin active against Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. When blood culture results were obtained, the antibiotic
agents were adjusted appropriately. Each patient in shock was given two
doses of methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg of body weight, one at the onset
of shock, and the second 4-8 h later. All blood specimens were obtained
at least 2 h after any infusion of corticosteroids or antibiotics. Respiratory
support was given as needed to maintain a normal pH and an arterial
partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) > 70 mmHg; all studies were done when
arterial Po2 and pH were normal. Ofthe 20 septic shock patients during
the acute phase, 12 were on mechanical ventilation, and 4 were on me￾chanical ventilation during the recovery phase of their illness.
Metabolic parameters, including serum electrolytes (sodium, potas￾sium, bicarbonate, chloride), phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and glu￾cose, were frequently (usually every 4-6 h) determined and any abnor￾malities were promptly corrected. Serum levels of metabolites are con￾sidered further below.
Cardiovascular studies employing radionuclide cineangiography.
Initial and serial radionuclide cineangiography studies were performed
on septic shock patients and critically ill controls; initial radionuclide
studies only were performed on control patients with structural heart
disease. The initial study was always done as near to the onset of shock
(or the critical illness precipitating intensive care unit admission) as was
technically and medically feasible, always within the first 24 h. Follow￾up studies were performed every 2-3 d up to 10 d after the acute phase
of the illness. A recovery scan was defined as a scan performed at least
5 d after clinical recovery from the acute illness or a scan demonstrating
recovery to an EF level comparable to a patient's presepsis EF (if known).
Electrocardiographic-gated cardiac scintigraphic examinations were
performed at the patient's bedside in the medical intensive care unit
using a portable Picker camera that was interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard
Co. (Palo Alto, CA) computer (20). Patients received an injection of
stannous pyrophosphate, and 30 min later received 20 mCi oftechnetium￾99m to accomplish in vivo labeling of the patient's erythrocytes. With
the patient in the supine position, the camera was positioned in a 350
left anterior oblique orientation with a 150 caudal tilt to isolate the left
ventricle. Left ventricular and background regions ofinterest were labeled,
and background corrected left ventricular time-activity curves were gen￾erated from the image sequence. Left ventricular EF was calculated from
each curve as EF - (EDC - ESC) + (EDC - Bkgd), where EDC = end
diastolic counts, ESC = end systolic counts, and Bkgd = background
counts. The end diastolic volume index (EDVI) and end systolic volume
index (ESVI) were calculated from simultaneously obtained hemody￾namic studies and ejection fractions, using the formulas: EDVI = SVI
(from thermodilution cardiac output) - EF (from radionuclide cinean￾giography) and ESVI = EDVI - SVI.
In vitro myocardial cell performance assay. We devised a modification
of previously described in vitro heart cell contractility system (21-26).
These systems had been shown to be affected by addition of calcium or
inotropic agents and were thus felt to reflect in vivo physiology.
Spontaneously beating newborn rat heart cell cultures were established
employing a modification of the technique described by Harary and
Farley (21). Using sterile techniques, the ventricular muscle was dissected
away from the atria and great vessels, cut into small 1-mm3 blocks of
tissue, and exposed to trypsinization (0.05% trypsin in modified Hanks'
balanced salt solution without Ca++ or Mg++) for 8-min periods at 37°C;
the suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm to pellet the tissue and cells,
then resuspended in 0.05% trypsin for another incubation. Usually two
to five incubation plus centrifugation steps were necessary to produce
single-cell suspensions.
The myocardial cell suspension was brought up in culture media
consisting of the following: potassium-free balanced salt solution (Dul￾becco's BSS-K) 65%; Medium 199, 25% (Grand Island Biological Com￾pany, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 1,000 U penicillin, 1,000
ug of streptomycin, and 10 mm of glutamine; and 10% heat-inactivated
(56°C for 30 min) newborn calf serum. The cell suspension was placed
into 35 X 10-mm petri dishes (Falcon Premaria-Becton Dickinson, Ox￾nard, CA) at a cell suspension of 3 X I0s cells/2-ml dish. Cells were
incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% air plus 5% CO2 and 100%
humidity. Growth media was changed after 48 h of incubation, and cells
gained near-confluence and began spontaneous beating rates (30-80
beats/min) at 3-6 d after inoculation. Beating cells were used in the assay
at 4-8 d postinoculation.
The extent and velocity of myocardial cell shortening during con￾traction was assayed by a modification of previously described techniques
(27). Fig. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of our myocardial cell perfor￾Circulating Myocardial Depressant in Septic Shock 1541

mance assay system. Beating myocardial cells in a petri dish were placed
on the microscope stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Nikon
Inc., Garden City, NY). A television camera (Philips Electronic Instru￾ments, Inc., Mahwah, NJ) was attached to the microscope and displayed
the image on a television monitor. An electronic video area detector was
employed to analyze the movement ofthe myocardial cell as it contracted
and relaxed. The output of the area detector was recorded on a dual￾channel strip chart recorder (Cleveite Brush Mach 20; Gould Inc., Brush
Div., Cleveland, OH) at multiple paper speeds. A Hewlett-Packard com￾puter electronically derived the first derivative ofthe extent ofshortening
(the velocity), which was recorded on the second channel of the strip
chart.
Fig. 2 demonstrates the method employed to evaluate cell motion
electronically. The edge of a contracting myocardial cell (at the end of
contraction) was placed at the border of a video field. The density of the
cell was greater than a specific density threshold that could be measured
by the electronic circuit within the video field. The density threshold is
adjustable and could be regulated to an appropriate level. Within the
video field, the specific density was below that which the electronic circuit
could measure. During myocardial cell relaxation, the cell (with its specific
density above the measurable threshold) would occupy a significant
amount of area within the video field. During contraction, the edge of
the cells would move to the edge of the video field and occupy little or
none of the area of the video field. The video field electronics had the
ability to measure instantaneously the area within the video field above

a specific density threshold. Thus, by plotting time versus the percentage
of the video field area above a specific density threshold, an accurate
representation of the extent of myocardial cell shortening (versus time)
could be plotted. An electronic derivative of this extent of shortening
would provide the velocity of myocardial cell contraction. The extent
and velocity of cell shortening during contraction were recorded on a
dual channel strip chart recorder. The electronic circuitry of this system
has been explained in more detail in previous publications (27).
Serum was obtained from patients or controls by drawing blood into
sterile glass test tubes, the blood was allowed to sit at room temperature
(20'C) for 30 min and then spun at 1,000 g for 15 min, and then serum
was pipetted in 0.5-ml aliquots into plastic tubes which were frozen at
-70'C until assayed. Serum was obtained within 0.5 h of the cardio￾vascular evaluation to which it was compared. Initially, assays of myo￾cardial cell extent and velocity ofshortening were performed immediately;
however, it was found that there was no change in results when comparing
assays performed on the same serum samples if the assay was performed
within 6 mo of one another (see Table III). Thus the depressant substance
appeared to be stable at -70'C for at least 6 mo.
To evaluate the effects of a specific serum sample, the test serum was
diluted (10% serum) in a physiologic media consisting of 65% Dulbecco's
BSS-K, and 25% Medium 199 (28). The culture media was aspirated off

the beating heart cells in a petri dish. The media was replaced with 2 ml
of physiologic media plus 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and
the cells were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min on the microscope stage.
It should be noted that preliminary experiments demonstrated that the
newborn calf serum used in these experiments produced no depression
or enhancement when compared to media alone with no serum. Thus,
heat-inactivated newborn calfserum in physiologic media was employed
as a control media. The extent and velocity of cell shortening with this
control media were recorded at a paper speed of 1 and 5 mm/s. Butterfly
needles of 2 1-gauge size had been placed through the side of the petri
dish to allow very slow removal and replacement of media over the cells
without mechanically disturbing the cells. The 2 ml of 10% test serum
plus physiological media was then placed over the cells and allowed to
equilibrate for 15 min. The extent and velocity of shortening were again
recorded on the strip chart at 1 and 5 mm/s of paper speed. The media
was again changed back to the original control physiologic media (several
volumes of control media washed the cells), equilibrated for 15 min, and
recorded as previously. In preliminary experiments employing from 1-
to 60-min incubations, it was documented that no test media took longer
than 15 min to produce the maximum effect on myocardial cell con￾traction; thus, all readings were subsequently performed after 15 min of
incubation. With all of the test sera used in this study, the depression or
enhancement of contractility was reversible by replacing the test sera
with control sera.
The percent depression or enhancement of myocardial cell perfor￾mance was calculated employing the following formula: Percent depres￾sion or enhancement = (decrease or increase in extent [or velocity] of
shortening with test serum)/(extent [or velocity] ofshortening with phys￾iologic media and 10% newborn calf serum).
To determine the extent or velocity of shortening for a test or control
sera, 10 beats of a myocardial cell extent and velocity of shortening were
measured and averaged. Test serum was initially run in duplicate samples
until the reproducibility of samples was always <10%; then a single de￾termination for each sample was performed. With 10 patients, test serums
were repeated on a different day with a different group of heart cells in
culture, and the reproducibility of any depression or enhancement was
found to be <10% (usually <5%) for all these determinations. Thus, the
assay demonstrated excellent reproducibility.
Preliminary experiments were performed to determine whether this
in vitro assay was responsive to pharmacologic agents that were known
to enhance or depress myocardial cell contractility. Table III contains
data that is representative of experiments performed to determine the
effects ofvarious catecholamines, corticosteroids, serum storage at -70'C,
verapamil, and calcium concentrations on the in vitro assay of myocardial
cell performance. Addition ofincreasing concentrations ofnorepinephrine
produced a stepwise increase in extent and velocity of shortening of
myocardial cells. Dopamine produced a mild increase in myocardial cell
performance at the highest concentration tested. Methylprednisolone
had no significant effect on myocardial performance in vitro. Storage of
a septic shock patient's sera for up to 12 mo at -70'C did not induce
any change in the ability of the sera to induce depression of both extent
and velocity of shortening during myocardial cell contraction. Increasing
concentrations ofthe calcium channel blocker, verapamil, caused a step￾wise decrease in myocardial performance. The electrolytes (Na, K, C02,
and Cl ) were all tested within the range seen during these experiments
and produced no change in myocardial cell performance (not shown in
Table III). Calcium concentrations (Table III) in increasing amounts
induced an increase in extent (and to a lesser degree in velocity) of short￾ening of myocardial cells during contraction. It should be noted that
multiple samples of patient sera (10%) mixed with physiologic media
were tested in this study and all test mixtures had a calcium level of 1.8
mm/ml because the 10% test sera were all diluted by a 90% media con￾taining 1.8 mm/ml of calcium (see below for further explanation).
Effects of rate on myocardial performance in vitro. For several ex￾periments, the beating rate of myocardial cells in vitro was increased by
pacing the spontaneously beating cells at a faster than spontaneous rate.
A Medtronic 5375 demand pulse generator (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis,
MN) was attached to a 4 French USCI bipolar pacemaker electrode.
The electrode was passed through a hole in the petri dish and put on top
of the beating myocardial cell monolayer. Employing a 20-mA output,
the cells could be paced at rates up to 120 beats/min.
Statistical evaluation. Comparisons between control and patient
groups were performed using the paired or unpaired Student's t test.
Spearman coefficients of rank correlation were calculated to evaluate
the relationships between the in vitro myocardial cell performance and
the in vivo radionuclide-determined EF. A P value of <0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant.
Results
Examples ofserum-induced decreases in in vitro myocardial cell
performance. Fig. 3 demonstrates several representative examples
of the effect of serum from patients during the acute phase of
septic shock on the in vitro performance of myocardial cell con￾traction. Acute-phase shock serum produced substantial de￾creases in both extent and velocity of shortening during con￾traction. After the test serum was removed from the cells, the
base-line extent and velocity of shortening return.
No test serum reported in this study induced a change of
>30 beats/min (only two patients changed their rate >20 beats/
min) in the rate of myocardial cell contraction. There was no
consistent pattern of change between the change in rate and the
change in performance, i.e., an increase or decrease in rate did
not predict a similar change in extent or velocity of shortening.
Comparison ofpatient and control groups. Fig. 4 illustrates
the percent change in extent of myocardial cell shortening in￾duced by 10% serum obtained from control groups (normal lab￾oratory personnel, patients with a decreased EF secondary to
structural heart disease, and critically ill nonseptic controls) and
from patients during the acute phase and during the recovery
phase or the presepsis phase oftheir illness. Statistical comparison
of the five groups reveals that the septic shock patients during
the acute phase had a statistically significantly lower
mean±standard error ofthe mean (SEM) percent change in am￾plitude (-33.0±4.0%, P < 0.001) when compared to any of the
three control groups (- 1.7±2.9% for laboratory personnel,
- 1.2±2.9% for structural heart disease, and -0.6±3.3% for crit￾ically ill nonseptic controls) or when compared to the recovery
or presepsis patients (+ 1 1.9 + 5.0%). None of the three control
groups demonstrated significant differences in extent of short￾ening. The recovery or presepsis patients had a statistically higher
(+ 1 1.9 + 5.0%) mean extent of shortening when compared to
any of the three control groups (P < 0.05).
The mean EF of the structural heart disease patients
(0.288±0.023) and the acute-phase septic shock patients
(0.329±0.029) were both significantly lower (P < 0.001) than
the critically ill nonseptic controls (0.564±0.025) and the re￾covery or presepsis septic shock patients (0.503±0.047). The
mean EF of the structural heart disease controls was similar to
the mean EF of the acute-phase septic shock patients (P = NS).
The mean EF of the critically ill septic shock controls was similar
to the mean EF of the recovery or presepsis septic shock patients
(P = NS).
Fig. 5 illustrates that similar results were seen when analyzing
the control and patient groups regarding the effect of serum on
the velocity of myocardial cell shortening in vitro. The mean
percent decrease (-24.6±3.9%) in myocardial cell velocity of
shortening induced by 10% serum from patients during the acute
phase of septic shock was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than
that induced by laboratory personnel (+ 1.9±3.4%), controls with

(-0.3±3.2%), or septic shock patients during the recovery or

shortening in the three control groups and the septic shock pa￾tients during the recovery or presepsis phase was similar
(P = NS comparing any two of these groups).
Comparison of survivors and nonsurvivors. There was no
statistically significant different between the in vitro extent or

nonsurvivors in any of the control groups or patient groups.
Comparison of acute- and recovery-phase EFs, extent, and
velocities ofshortening. Fig. 6 provides a comparison ofthe effects
of serum on myocardial cell extent and velocity of shortening
compared with radionuclide EF during both the acute and re￾covery (or presepsis) phases of septic shock in 11 septic shock
patients. In these 11 patients, the EF rose from (mean±SEM)
0.283±0.041 during the acute phase to 0.503±0.047 during the
recovery or presepsis phase; the percent change in extent of
shortening rose from -37.9±4.9% to 11.9±5.0%; the percent
change in myocardial cell velocity of shortening rose from
-26.6±5.0% to + 12.4±6.4%. All of these increases were highly
statistically significant (P < 0.001 comparing acute to recovery
or presepsis phases of EF, amplitude, or velocity). All 11 patients
demonstrated simultaneous increases in EFs, extent of myocar￾dial cell shortening, and velocity of myocardial cell shortening
while going from the acute to the recovery or presepsis phase of
septic shock. If only nine patients (excluding the two patients
who were nonsurvivors and had presepsis rather than recovery
data) were used in the acute- and recovery-phase analysis, all of
the statistical analyses remain highly statistically significantly
different and were identical to those comparisons with 11 pa￾tients.
Comparison ofacute- and recovery-phase cardiovascular pa￾rameters other than EF. In addition to EFs, other cardiovascular
parameters that could be determined from thermodilution car￾diac indices, e.g., SVI, or calculated from radionuclide EF and
thermodilution cardiac index, e.g., end diastolic volume index,
were analyzed. These cardiovascular functional parameters were
compared during the acute and recovery phases, and also com￾pared to the in vitro amplitude and velocity of myocardial cell
contraction.
In the 11 septic shock patients with acute and recovery
(n = 9) or presepsis (n = 2) cardiovascular evaluations, in contrast
to the EF which increased toward normal in every patient (see

Figure 3. Representative examples of the effect of
serum from three different patients during the acute
phase of septic shock. For each patient, the upper
panel displays the extent of shortening and the lower
panel displays velocity of shortening without shock
serum. A mixture of 10% shock serum and 90%
physiologic media was added to the cells in the petri
dish and allowed to incubate for 15 min at 370C and
a recording was made; then the 10% shock serum/
media mixture was removed, the dish was washed
and replaced with several volumes of media plus
10% control serum (newborn calf). After 15 min of
incubation, another recording was made. The for￾mula employed for calculating the percent depres￾sion is shown in the diagram. For each patient, 10
consecutive beats were averaged to produce one

Fig. 6), the cardiac index changes were variable: five patients
increased, five patients decreased, and one patient was un￾changed. Similar variable changes were evident in stroke volume
index. In these same I1 patients, the end diastolic volume index
decreased toward normal in 10 patients, the only exception was
in a nonsurvivor (patient P11 in Table I).
It should be noted that of the 20 septic shock patients (Table
I), 17 patients are identical with those reported in a previous
study ( 1 7). For an analysis of the transient reversible changes in
EF, cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic vascular re￾sistance index, and end diastolic volume index, evident in septic
shock patients, the reader is referred to this previous study.
Correlation of EF with the extent of myocardial cell short￾ening. Fig. 7 illustrates the relationship between the radionuclide￾determined in vivo left ventricular EF and the in vitro percent
change in extent of myocardial cell shortening in the 20 septic
shock patients during the acute phase. Using the Spearman rank
method, there was a statistically significant positive correlation
between these two variables with an r value of +0.52 and a
P < 0.01. Although a positive correlation was noted (r = +0.19)
between EF and myocardial cell velocity of shortening (no il￾lustration), this relationship lacked statistical significance
(P = NS).
As with EFs, Spearman rank correlations were performed
between cardiac index, stroke volume index, and end diastolic
volume index versus in vitro myocardial cell amplitude and ve￾locity. No significant correlations were found between cardiac
index or stroke volume index and any in vitro parameter. How￾ever, in the 20 acute-phase septic shock patients, the end diastolic
volume index demonstrated a significant negative correlation
(r = -0.41, P < 0.05) with the extent of myocardial cell short￾ening; no significant correlation was seen with velocity.
Evaluation ofother parameters that could potentially affect
myocardial cell performance. As mentioned in Methods, all of

dioxide, chloride, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and glucose.
All these electrolytes and metabolites were kept in the normal
range. Because the myocardial contractility assay was performed
on 10% test serum plus 90% physiologic media, the latter would
tend to correct any abnormality due to electrolyte differences.
We measured the 10% serum and media mixture for concen￾trations of Na, K, Ca, P04, Mg, and serum pH on 10 septic
shock sera that produced depressions in myocardial extent of
shortening and compared them to 10 sera and media mixture
from 10 critically ill nonseptic patients. The electrolyte concen￾trations were essentially identical in these two groups. We con￾cluded that electrolyte differences could not account for the dif￾ferences in myocardial performance in vitro.
We analyzed the pharmacologic therapy of the patients and
controls. Particular attention was paid to any pharmacologic
agent that was felt to potentially affect cardiac function. No pa￾tient in this study was receiving digitalis, beta-blocking agents,
or calcium channel-blocking agents. No serum was obtained
within 3 h of a large dose of corticosteroids.
As mentioned in Methods, all these patients were treated by
one group of critical care physicians according to a sequential
protocol that began with fluid administration to increase the
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to 15 mmHg. The pul￾monary capillary wedge pressure was very similar in the 20 acute￾phase septic shock patients (mean = 12.5 mmHg) and the 17
critically ill nonseptic control patients (mean = 13.2 mmHg,
P = NS). If one employed the end diastolic volume index as a
measure of preload (some authors would argue that end diastolic
volume is a better measure of preload than pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure [ 18]), the acute-phase septic shock patients have
a higher end diastolic volume than the critically ill nonseptic
controls but they have a decreased ventricular performance de￾spite a higher preload. We concluded that differences in preload
cannot account for the differences between patients and controls.
Some patients were receiving the vasopressor agents dopa￾mine and/or levarterenol. However, the septic shock patients

Figure 6. A comparison of the effects of serum on the extent (upper
panel, circles) and velocity (upper panel, boxes) of myocardial cell
shortening compared with radionuclide-determined EF (lower panel,
circles) in 11 patients both during the acute and recovery (n = 9) or
presepsis (n = 2) phases of septic shock. (o, 0) Patients who survived;
(e, .) patients who were nonsurvivors. The lines connect the acute and
recovery or sepsis phases for each patient. In all 11 patients, the transi￾tion from acute phase to recovery (n = 9) or presepsis (n = 2) phase
was characterized by an increase in the in vivo EF and an increase in
the in vitro measures of extent and velocity of myocardial cell short￾ening.
during the acute phase demonstrated significant decreases in
myocardial cell extent and velocity of shortening during con￾traction, yet these patients were receiving dopamine and nor￾epinephrine, agents which enhanced contractility when tested
in vitro (Table III). Thus, the findings in this study were con￾tradictory to what one would predict if catecholamine infusions
were accounting for our findings. One could argue that even
greater in vitro depressions might be evidenced if catecholamines
were not in the serum tested. Further, 8 of the 20 septic shock
patients during the acute phase were not receiving exogenous
dopamine or norepinephrine and these 8 patients had depressions
similar to those of the 12 receiving infusions. Conversely, some
nonseptic critically ill controls were receiving dopamine or lev￾arterenol and none developed decreases in in vitro myocardial
cell performance. In addition, employing Spearman rank coef￾ficients in the acute-phase septic shock patients, no correlation
was found between changes in myocardial extent or velocity of
shortening and doses of dopamine or norepinephrine. Thus, we
conclude that vasopressor administration cannot account for
the findings reported in this study.
The relationship between mechanical ventilation or the
amount of positive end expiratory pressure versus the EF and
the in vitro myocardial cell performance was investigated. In
the 20 acute-phase septic shock patients, the 12 patients on me￾chanical ventilation had similar EFs and myocardial cell per￾formance in vitro when compared to nonmechanically ventilated
patients. In this group, patients on significant levels of positive
end expiratory pressure (>5 cmH2O) also had similar EFs and
myocardial cell performance in vitro when compared to patients
on <5 cm or no positive end expiratory pressure. Several critically
ill nonseptic patients were on mechanical ventilation and/or on
positive end expiratory pressure and none demonstrated a de￾creased EF or a depressed in vitro myocardial cell performance.
Thus, mechanical ventilation or positive end expiratory pressure
could not account for the findings reported in this study.
Analysis of serial cardiovascular studies and serial in vitro
myocardial cell performance studies in nonsurviving patients. As
shown in Fig. 6, septic shock patients who survived would in￾crease their EF toward normal, and the extent and velocity of
in vitro myocardial cell performance increased toward control
levels. One theory of myocardial dysfunction in septic shock
(12-14) argued that nonsurvivors of septic shock would develop
a myocardial depressant factor-induced progressive decrease in
cardiac index during the late stage of the disease ultimately cul￾minating in a low cardiac index-induced death. Ofthe 20 septic
shock patients reported in this study (Table I), six were nonsur￾vivors. One of these six, Pl0 (see Table I), demonstrated a pro￾gressive decrease in both EF and cardiac index over an 1 l-d
illness with a concomitant decrease in serum-induced depression
of myocardial cell amplitude (from + 17% to -4 1%) and velocity.
However, five of the six nonsurviving patients demonstrated no
significant changes in cardiac index or EF over a 2-10.d (mean
= 5 d) illness, and serum-induced depression of myocardial cell
extent of shortening (from - 17% to - 17%) and velocity of
shortening did not change as the patients approached their de￾mise.

Figure 8. The effect of increasing the percentage of serum in the
serum/media mixture on the extent (.) and velocity (o) of myocardial
cell shortening using serum from a patient during the acute phase of
septic shock. The serum concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 20% were
used and resulted in a stepwise decrease in extent and velocity of
shortening. Please see text for further details.
Dose response ofdepressant serum. Fig. 8 demonstrates the
dose-response characteristics of serum from a representative pa￾tient (P4) during the acute phase of septic shock. Increasing the
amount of depressant serum in the media applied to the beating
myocardial cells resulted in a stepwise decrease in both the extent
and velocity of shortening during myocardial cell contraction.
This dose-response capability was demonstrable with any serum
containing depressant activity.
Analysis ofthe effect ofmyocardial cell beating rate on extent
and velocity ofmyocardial cell shortening. Table IV summarizes
an experiment to evaluate the effect of myocardial cell rate on
myocardial cell performance. Employing an exogenous pace￾maker, the myocardial cell monolayer beating rate was increased
from 30 to as high as 72 beats/min without any increase or
decrease in extent or velocity of myocardial cell shortening.
Shock sera (10%) induced a decrease in extent (-36%) and ve￾locity (- 15%) of myocardial cell shortening at a spontaneous
beating rate of 30/min. When the beating rate was increased to
48/min by the pacemaker, no significant change in extent or
velocity of myocardial cell shortening was produced. Thus,
changes in beating rate did not affect myocardial performance
in vitro.
Experiments performed to characterize the molecular size
and solubility characteristics ofmyocardial depressant substance.
Tables V and VI summarize a series of experiments performed
to characterize the size and solubility characteristics of the cir￾culating depressant substance. Patient serum obtained during
the acute phase ofseptic shock and containing depressant activity
was placed in cellophane dialysis bags and dialyzed against a
1,000-mIl bath of 20 mm of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with
pH of 7.40 at 40C. The bath was replaced with fresh PBS every
12 h for a 48-h period. As controls, patient shock serum was
kept in the same 40C cold room for 48 h. Dialyzed serum lost
its depressant activity, whereas control nondialyzed serum re￾tained the ability to depress extent and velocity of heart cell
shortening. Thus, myocardial depressant substance can diffuse
through a dialysis membrane. In general, molecules with a mol
wt 10,000 or less can pass through this type of membrane. Thus,
myocardial depressant substance probably has a mol wt <10,000.
Although Table V contains data from two patients, this dialysis
equipment has been performed on four shock patients with sim￾ilar results to those shown.
Table V B demonstrates representative experimental results
from serum of patients with septic shock passed through Amicon
filters (Amicon Cotp., Dapvers, MA), filters designed to separate
molecules on the basis of molecular size. Employing membranes
that allow passage of molecules with mol wt <10,000 (Amicon
filter PM 1O) or <5,000 (Amicon filter YM5) demonstrate that
depressant activity is clearly contained in the group with mol
wt <5,000. Employing a membrane (Amicon YC05) that allows
passage of only small molecules (<500 mol wt), the activity is
retained in the residual (>500 mol wt) fraction (Table V B3).
Because salt, catecholamines, and most pharmacologic agents
are found in the fraction with a mol wt <500, this experiment
provides strong data against these substances accounting for de￾Table IV. Effect ofPacemaker-induced Changes in Cellular Beating Rate

pressant activity. Based on these filtration experiments, the
myocardial depressant substance probably has a mol wt between
500 and 5000.
The solubility of myocardial depressant substance was eval￾uated by employing ethylacetate, an organic solvent (Table V
C). After passing serum with known depressant activity through
a PM IQ filter to exclude the nondepressant fraction with mol
wt >10,000, the filtrate was lyophilized, dissolved in 1 ml of
distilled water, mixed with 1 ml of ethylacetate, thoroughly
mixed, and allowed to separate into aqueous and organic phases.
The aqueous phase was lyophilized, and the organic phase was
evaporated under nitrogen. As shown in Table V, all the activity
was retained in the aqueous phase. This argues for a water-soluble
depressant substance, e.g., a protein or carbohydrate or a com￾bination of these two, and makes an organic soluble substance,

Table VI demonstrates a representative gel filtration with
G-25 Sephadex, using serum with depressant activity obtained
from a patient during the acute phase of septic shock. Similar
patterns of G-25 isolation have been seen with four other septic
shock patients (not shown). As seen in Table VI, depressant
activity was found in fractions 15 and 16 and no other fraction
demonstrated significant enhancement or depression (in a single
experiment, a decrease or increase of 20% or more is considered
definitely significant). Using the known protein markers, the
molecular weight of myocardial depressant substance is between
the a-chain insulin (mol wt 2,530) and vitamin B12 (mol wt
1,355). This finding confirms the Amicon filteration range of
500-5,000 mol wt, and narrows the probable mol wt to -2,000.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that septic shock patients have a cir￾culating myocardial depressant substance in their blood during
the acute phase of septic shock. This substance has been shown

cardial cell contraction in an in vitro model of myocardial cell
performance. Importantly, this depressant activity has been
shown to be absent from serum obtained from normal laboratory
personnel, from patients with reduced EFs due to structural heart
disease, and from critically ill but nonseptic patients. Employing
serial blood sampling and serial measures of cardiovascular
function, this depressant activity has been shown to be present
during the acute phase of septic shock but to be absent from
recovery serum or from presepsis serum. During the acute phase
of septic shock, the decreased EF and the increased end diastolic
volume index (but not cardiac index or stroke volume index)
significantly correlated with the depression in the extent of myo￾cardial cell shortening in vitro. This correlation suggested that
the amount of decrease in the extent of myocardial cell short￾ening in vitro was reflecting the pathophysiologic events re￾sponsible for myocardial depression during the acute phase of
septic shock in vivo.
Previous studies have described a myocardial depressant
factor in various forms of shock (29-38). However, these studies
have been significantly flawed due to a variety of reasons, and
a chapter reviewing our current understanding of shock in a
recent major textbook of medicine (39) termed the presence and
role of myocardial depressant factors as "controversial." Many
of the previous studies did not include appropriate control
groups, i.e., the studies did not demonstrate that depressant ac￾tivity was absent from normals and absent from other critically
ill patients who were not in shock. Other studies did not clearly
demonstrate that exogenous medication or electrolyte abnor￾malities were not responsible for the myocardial depression.
Critical investigators have noted that a high salt concentration
probably accounted for cardiac depressant activity in a number
of experimental systems (40). Most of these previous studies
have employed the canine hemorrhagic shock model, a model
that is not clearly analogous to any form of human shock.
In addition, none of these studies have clearly related the
presence of in vitro myocardial depression (usually employing
a papillary muscle or Langendorf isolated heart preparation) to
clear-cut cardiac depression in vivo. This relationship is very
important and must be proven to exist in order to relate an in
vitro phenomenon to the pathophysiologic mechanisms respon￾sible for myocardial depression during shock in patients. Thus,
in the present study, we have demonstrated the existence of a
myocardial depressant substance in the blood of human septic
shock patients early in their course, and quantitatively and tem￾porally related the presense of this depressant activity to con￾comitant evidence of myocardial dysfunction as demonstrated
by a decreased EF and left ventricular dilatation.
The relationship of this circulating myocardial depressant
substance to the complex pathogenesis ofthe human septic shock
syndrome is an important but only partially understood phe￾nomena. The cardiovascular abnormalities characteristic of the
human septic shock include both cardiac dysfunction and a pe￾ripheral vascular abnormality (41). There is also evidence that
the initial or early cardiovascular hemodynamic pattern may
differ substantially from the hemodynamic abnormalities char￾acteristic of the late phase of septic shock, especially the late
phase in nonsurvivors (42). Most of the data reported in this
study reflects the early stages of the septic shock syndrome, a
time characterized by a high or normal cardiac index, a decreased
peripheral systemic vascular resistance, and, as recently dem￾onstrated (17), a decreased EF. Employing volume infusions in
septic shock patients, two recent studies (43, 44) confirmed the
presence of severe reversible myocardial dysfunction in the early
phase of human septic shock. Thus, three studies have dem￾onstrated evidence of in vivo myocardial dysfunction early in
human septic shock, and the present study has provided evidence
that in vitro myocardial depressant activity was clearly present
during these initial few days in a large subpopulation of patients
with septic shock.
Because patients during the early stages of septic shock have
evidence of tissue ischemia with elevation of circulating lactic
acid, one possible role of myocardial depressant substance would
be to reduce cardiac output resulting in a less than maximal
output for any particular patient. This could well contribute to
peripheral tissue ischemia. This effect is probably not the major
mechanism of tissue ischemia in that the cardiac index and stroke
volume are normal or elevated in early septic shock; however,
it may be a contributing factor. Maldistribution of peripheral
blood flow probably accounts for most of the tissue ischemia
(10-14). In one nonsurviving patient in this study (patient PlO
in Table I), there were multiple serial measures of both cardio￾vascular function and myocardial depressant activity until the
day of death. In this patient, myocardial depressant activity per￾sisted in the serum until death, and the patient demonstrated
serial decreases in cardiac indices and EFs that resulted in a low
output syndrome and patient demise. The pattern in this one
nonsurvivor suggested that myocardial depressant substance may
occasionally cause severe myocardial dysfunction that becomes
incompatible with life. However, this pattern is probably not
common-most nonsurvivors (or survivors) do not develop a
late decrease in either EF or cardiac index. Myocardial depressant
activity has not been measured in enough patients to warrant
generalizations regarding characteristic serial patterns.
The in vitro myocardial cell contractility assay employed in
this study represented a modification of previously described
cell culture methods (21-28). These models have been shown
to develop spontaneous beating rates and the cells respond to
pharmacologic and physiologic agents with appropriate changes
e.g., increases or decreases in beating rate or cell inotropy. The
latter is usually measured as an increase or decrease in the extent
and/or velocity of shortening ofa cultured heart cell. Electrolytes,
catecholamines, thyroid hormones, and pharmacologic agents
have produced appropriate changes in heart cell performance
in vitro. As documented in Table III, the myocardial contractility
model employed in the present studies responded appropriately
to a wide variety of electrolytes and pharmacologic agents. Serum
from control or septic patients produced little or only modest
changes in beating rate, and the changes in rate were not cor￾related with changes in cell performance, i.e., extent or velocity
of myocardial cell shortening.
Several methods were employed to exclude the possibility
that the myocardial depression resulted from salt, electrolytes,
pharmacologic agents, or other unsuspected substance. Several
control groups were employed. The control group with structural
heart disease excluded the possibility that all patients with de￾creased EFs produced a substance that decreased myocardial
cell performance. The control group of critically ill nonseptic
patients was included to exclude the possibility that all critically
ill patients produce a "toxic" substance that could depress myo￾cardial cell performance. This latter control group included sev￾eral patients with hypovolemic shock (n = 3), cardiogenic shock
(n = 1), and severe pericardial tamponade (n = 1). None ofthese
nonseptic causes of shock were associated with a circulating
myocardial depressant substance. Thus, unlike some canine
Circulating Myocardial Depressant in Septic Shock 1551

models of hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) or cardiogenic shock, hu￾mans with these nonseptic causes of shock did not show evidence
of a circulating myocardial cell depressant substance.
Another group of patients that provided a superb control
comparison was the patients who recovered (n = 9) or had a
presepsis (n = 2) blood sampling and ventricular performance
studies. Serum obtained from these 11 patients during the acute
phase of septic shock had clear evidence of depressed EF in vivo
and a decreased myocardial cell performance in vitro; however,
during the recovery phase of presepsis phase, these same patients
had returned to normal or mildly enhanced in vitro myocardial
cell performance. Thus, the myocardial depressant substance
could be produced by a septic shock patient within a few hours
(the earliest evidence of in vitro depression was obtained 2 h
after the onset ofseptic shock), and the substance could be cleared
from the serum within 2-3 d.
In addition to using several control groups, we have directly
assayed the electrolyte concentrations in the serum/media mix￾ture bathing the myocardial cells and found no differences in
electrolyte concentrations between depressant and nondepressant
serum/media mixtures. As judged by dialysis, Amicon filtration,
and G-25 gel filtration, the molecular weight of the depressant
substance (-2,000) was in a range inconsistent with any elec￾trolyte, catecholamine, or other exogenous pharmacologic agent.
In recent years, a number ofserum substances with potential
physiologic capabilities have been described. A recent study (45)
characterized a serum factor that was capable of causing in￾creased release of amino acids from skeletal muscle cells grown
in vitro. Serum from patients with sepsis or trauma (clinical
syndromes known to be associated with severe proteolysis and
catabolism) demonstrated the most potent capability to induce
release of amino acids. Previous studies (35, 36) of cultured rat
myocardial cells have shown that sera from patients with sepsis
could inhibit isoproterenol-induced increases in beating rate.
The relationship of the depressant substance described in this
study to those cited above will require further study.
The relationship of this myocardial depressant substance to
survival of the patient deserves specific consideration. In a pre￾vious publication (17), we noted the somewhat paradoxical find￾ing that septic shock patients with an initially depressed EF had
a higher survival than patients with an initially normal or elevated
EF. As can be seen in Figs. 4, 5, and 7, a normal or high EF was
seen in many ofthe nonsurvivors. However, when we specifically
analyzed the quantity of myocardial depression (extent and ve￾locity of shortening) in vitro during the acute phase of septic
shock, there were no significant differences between the survivors
and nonsurvivors. Thus, although the amount of myocardial
depressant substance positively correlated with the profound ef￾fect on ventricular function, the circulating depressant did not
show a significant correlation with the survival in these patients.
The relationship between myocardial depressant substance and
prognosis will require further study and a better understanding
of both the structure and function of this circulating depressant
substance.
