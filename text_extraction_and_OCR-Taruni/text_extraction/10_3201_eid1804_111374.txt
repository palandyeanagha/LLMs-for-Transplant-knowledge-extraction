To investigate Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus 
in Turkey, we conducted a seroepidemiologic survey during 
January–April 2009. Seroprevalence of infection was 10% 
in a sample from an outbreak region and increased with 
patient age, indicating that the virus had been previously 
present in Turkey. We also estimated that 88% of infections 
were subclinical.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) 
infection was fi rst recognized in Turkey in 2002. 
Since that time, the number of diagnosed cases has 
increased to the magnitude of an outbreak with major 
public health consequences (1,2). Although the clinical 
spectrum may change from asymptomatic infection to 
severe hemorrhagic disease, most studies to date have 
included only symptomatic cases (1–6). Therefore, the 
true incidence of infection with the virus, the full spectrum 
of severity of disease, and its epidemiologic features are 
unknown. The purpose of our study was to investigate the 
seroprevalence of CCHFV infection in a suffi ciently large 
sample representative of the region affected during this 
outbreak in Turkey and to describe the main epidemiologic 
features, including the proportion of subclinical cases.
The Study
During January–April 2009, we conducted a survey 
that included obtaining venous blood samples from 
participants. The study sample was selected by using a 
random geographic cluster sampling stratifi ed by age and 
sex from rural residential areas of Turkey where 99.5% 
of CCHF cases were reported (Figure 1). Only adults 
>18 years of age who were living in the study area for >1 
year were eligible for the study. The study was approved 
by the Central Ethics Committee, and informed consent 
was obtained from all participants. A study questionnaire 
included questions on demographics, socioeconomic 
status, behavior characteristics, medical history, known risk 
factors for CCHFV infection, and participants’ awareness 
of the outbreak and infection prevention methods.
Serum samples were tested for IgG against CCHFV 
at the Virology Reference Laboratory of the Refi k Saydam 
National Public Health Agency, (Ankara, Turkey) by 
using a commercial ELISA kit (Vector-Best, Novosibrisk, 
Russia). Although the sensitivity and specifi city of the kit 
were not specifi ed by the manufacturer, studies that used 
this method have reported a sensitivity of 87%–98.3% and 
a specifi city of 99%–100% (7,8). We defi ned subclincial 
cases as those in persons who were seropositive although 
they were not given a diagnosis or had not had severe 
symptoms compatible with CCHF at any time.
In addition, we compared information in our database 
with that in the database of reported cases at the Ministry 
of Health, Turkey. We used the χ2 test, t test, and Mann￾Whitney U test for univariate statistical comparisons, as 
appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression was used 
to assess independent risk factors for seropositivity. We 
used the direct standardization method to adjust age￾specifi c seropositivity rates for our study population with 
the age composition of the entire outbreak region. This 
adjustment enabled us to calculate expected numbers of 
infected (seropositive) persons in the outbreak region 
(online Technical Appendix, wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
pdfs/11-1374-Techapp.pdf). Clinically diagnosed cases 
were compared with expected numbers of infections, and 
an observed:expected ratio was calculated.
The survey included 3,671 adults of whom 3,557 
(97%) provided blood samples for serologic analysis. The 
mean ± SD age of the study population was 44.3 ± 16.2 
years, the female:male ratio was 1.04 (51%:49%), and 
the most common occupation was farming (52.4%). Only 
18.2% had a history of tick bite.
Of 3,557 serum samples tested, 356 (10%) were 
positive for IgG against CCHFV. Mean ± SD age was 43.4 
± 16.2 years for seronegative persons and 52 ± 17.1 years 
for seropositive persons (p<0.001). Categorizing persons by

age in 10-year intervals showed that seropositivity increased 
with age (p<0.001) (Figure 2). Univariate analysis showed 
that seropositive persons had less education (p<0.001), 
were more likely to be involved in farming, (p<0.001), 
and had a higher frequency of tick bites (p<0.001) than 
seronegative persons (Table 1). Animal husbandry as an 
occupation and a history of hunting were not more frequent 
among seropositive persons than among seronegative 
persons. A high proportion of seropositive persons (73.8%) 
and seronegative persons (71.3%), claimed that they had 
suffi cient information about the infection and how to protect 
themselves (p = 0.329). Multivariable analysis results 
showed that an age >60 years, less schooling, farming as 
an occupation, and a history of tick bites were independent 
risk factors for seropositivity (Table 2).
None of the study population had been given a 
diagnosis of CCHF or had been hospitalized for an acute 
febrile illness or severe bleeding compatible with CCHF. 
During 2002–2009, a total of 1,806 adults were given 
a diagnosis of CCHF in the outbreak region where we 
conducted our study (Ministry of Health, Turkey). Direct 
standardization of age-specifi c seroprevalence rates for the 
study population with ages of persons in the entire region 
showed that 15,156 infections would be expected during 
2002–2008 (observed:expected ratio 0.12; 95% CI 0.114–
0.125). This fi nding shows that only 12% of the infections 
were diagnosed and 88% were subclinical.
Conclusions
We found that the seroprevalence of CCHF in the 
study region was 10%. Hoogstraal et al. reported that 
the expected seroprevalence of CCHF was ≈10% during 
epidemics (9). In a small survey in Turkey, IgG against 
CCHFV was detected in 12.8% of the population in high￾risk areas (10). Our study showed that the distribution of 
seropositivity increased with age (Figure 2). This fi nding 
was unexpected and showed that CCHF was present 
in the region long before it was recognized. However, 
we could not assess whether incidence or severity were 
amplifi ed in recent years, which led to its detection in 
2002. Seroprevalence surveys with representative samples 
at regular intervals may be the only way for determining if 
incidence of infection has increased.
Another useful result from this study was the ability to 
predict that ≈90% of CCHFV infections were subclinical

(online Technical Appendix). This fi nding has clinical and 
epidemiologic implications. First, it shows that the spectrum 
of severity is highly skewed toward milder disease, although 
CCHF is believed to be a severe infection similar to other 
hemorrhagic fevers such as those caused by Ebola or Marburg 
viruses. Epidemiologically, information about subclinical 
cases is necessary for estimating the level of herd immunity 
in the population and predicting the characteristics of the 
outbreak. Finally, we do not know precisely why CCHF 
develops into a serious or fatal disease in some patients but 
is only a mild or asymptomatic in others (11). Some studies 
have shown that factors such as immune response of the host, 
viral load, or lack of some receptors may affect the clinical 
form of infection (12,13). Some authors have suggested that 
geographic variation in pathogenicity of the virus (14) may 
also be a factor in severity, although the supporting data are 
lacking (15). Therefore, timely detection and comparison of 
different clinical groups will be helpful in understanding the 
pathogenicity of the virus or host responses and developing 
effective treatments for infection.
