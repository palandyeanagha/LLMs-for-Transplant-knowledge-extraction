Abstract
We have recently shown that human monocytes and U937 cells
possess two molecular classes of Fcy receptor. One, a 72,000-
mol-wt sialoglycoprotein, has high affinity for certain subclasses
of human and murine monomeric IgG. The other is a 40,000-
mol-wt protein (p40) with low affinity for monomeric IgG but
with the capacity to bind IgG aggregates or IgG-coated particles.
In the present study, a 40,000-mol-wt single chain protein,
apparently identical to p40 from U937 cells, was isolated from
surface-radioiodinated human platelets by affinity purification
using a murine IgG2b monoclonal antibody to p40. This 40,000-
mol-wt protein was not seen when control IgG2b or unrelated
murine monoclonal antibodies were employed in place of anti￾p40. The same 40,000-mol-wt protein was also recovered from
an IgG-Sepharose affinity adsorbent, but not from ovalbumin￾or myoglobin-Sepharose. The 72,000-mol-wt Fcvy receptor of
monocytes was not identified on platelets.
Monoclonal anti-p4O and Fab fragments derived from this
antibody blocked platelet aggregation by heat-aggregated human
IgG, whereas a control murine IgG2b protein had little or no
inhibitory effect at 500-1,000-fold higher concentrations. A mu￾rine IgG1 monoclonal antibody, reactive with an unrelated plate￾let-specific membrane antigen, did not inhibit platelet responses
to aggregated IgG. Anti-p4O did not affect platelet aggregation
by thrombin, collagen, or fibrinogen plus ADP. Although anti￾p40 did not directly aggregate platelets in the concentrations
employed, cross-linking with F(ab'`) goat anti-murine Ig induced
apyrase-sensitive aggregation of anti-p40-treated platelets. This
indicates that p40 possesses transmembrane linkage for platelet
activation and secretion.
These observations strongly suggest that this newly recog￾nized 40,000-mol-wt platelet membrane protein serves as an Fcy
receptor.
Introduction
The existence of Fc'y receptors on human platelets has been
supported by several lines of evidence, including Fc-dependent
secretory and aggregation responses to IgG aggregates and IgG￾bearing immune complexes (1-6), direct radioligand binding
studies with IgG dimers and larger oligomers (7), and a report

of a KBr-solubilized 255,000-mol-wt platelet membrane gly￾coprotein exhibiting reactivity with aggregated IgG (8).
In recent reports from this laboratory (9, 10) evidence was
presented that human monocytes and a related cell line, U937,
possess two molecular classes of Fcy receptors: one, the high
affinity 72,000-mol-wt sialoglycoprotein receptor (p72)' previ￾ously described ( 11); the other, a newly recognized 40,000-mol￾wt membrane protein (p40). Molecular and functional analysis
ofthe p40 protein was facilitated by the development ofa murine
anti-p40 monoclonal antibody (MAb). This MAb also recognizes
p40 molecules on human granulocytes, on the erythroblastic
cell line, K562, and, more weakly, on the B lymphocyte line,
Daudi (9).
In the present study on human platelets, application of this
anti-p40 MAb as well as IgG affinity adsorption procedures have
demonstrated that the platelet possesses a 40,000-mol-wt mem￾brane protein that is very similar, if not identical, to p40 derived
from U937 cells. Functional studies suggest that this 40,000-
mol-wt protein serves as a platelet Fcy receptor.
Methods
Buffers. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0, contained 146 mM
NaCl and 20 mM phosphate. Standard Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.3, contained
138 mM NaCI, 2.7 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.36 mM NaH2PO4, 1
mM MgCl2, and 5.5 mM dextrose. Several modified Tyrode's buffers,
all at pH 7.3, were employed as follows: (a) with 6.6 mM EDTA; (b)
with 6.6 mM EDTA plus 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO); (c) with 6.6 mM EDTA plus 5 mM KI;
and (d) with 2 mM CaCI2 plus 2% BSA.
Platelet-reactive reagents. Human IgG was purified from Cohn frac￾tion II (Sigma Chemical Co.) by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Ag￾gregated IgG was prepared from a stock solution of this IgG (10 mg/ml
in PBS) on the day of each experiment by heating (63°C, 15-30 min)
after which insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Human
thrombin a-IIa was a gift from Dr. Paula Tracy and Dr. William Rodgers,
Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center,
Rochester, NY. Collagen (calf skin), adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and
apyrase were all purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Fibrinogen, purified
from human plasma by the method of Blomback and Blomback (12),
and 99% clottable by thrombin, was lyophilized in 68 mM Na citrate￾78 mM NaCl, stored at 4°C, and freshly reconstituted in distilled water
for each experiment.
Murine antibodies and immunoglobulins. Preparation of monoclonal
IgG2b anti-p4O (IV.3) is fully described elsewhere (9). Briefly, CAF1
[(BALB/c X A/J)F1] mice were immunized with p40-rich K562 human
erythroid cells and hybridomas prepared by fusion of spleen cells with
cells of the P3. X 63. Ag8.653 nonsecretory cell line by methods described

previously (13, 14). Culture supernatants of clones were screened for
their ability to inhibit rosette formation of K562 cells with human eryth￾rocytes precoated with murine-IgGl antiglycophorin antibody (gift of
Dr. W. L. Bigbee, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, Livermore,
CA). Anti-p40 employed in experiments on receptor isolation was su￾pematant culture fluid of clone IV.3 in RPMI 1640 supplemented by
10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Sterile Systems Inc.,
Logan, UT), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 ,g/ml), gentamycin
(40 ,g/ml), L-glutamine (0.3 mM), Hepes (1 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol
(50 ,tM), sodium pyruvate (2 mM), and Eagles's minimal essential me￾dium nonessential amino acids (50 gM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY).
Functional (inhibition) studies employed DE-52 (Whatman Inc., Clifton,
NJ) chromatographically isolated IgG from ascites of CAF1 mice that
had been inoculated with hybridoma IV.3. Control antibodies and im￾munoglobulins were as follows: (a) UR- 1, an IgG 1 murine monoclonal
antibody selectively reactive with the human platelet membrane (precise
antigen specificity unknown) (15) kindly supplied as ascites fluid by Dr.
Neil Blumberg, Department ofPathology, University of Rochester Med￾ical Center2; (b) mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma (MOPC)-141 murine
IgG2b myeloma protein purified from ascites by DE-52 anion exchange
chromatography; and (c) IgG2b murine monoclonal anti-Vkiiib, previ￾ously described ( 14).
After preliminary studies to establish correct conditions, papain digests
of IgG2b anti-p40 (IV.3) and IgG2b MOPC-141 myeloma protein were
concurrently prepared from DE-52 purified fractions of each protein by
incubation (37°C, 30 min) with a 1:25 enzyme/substrate ratio (wt/wt)
of papain (Cooper Biomedical Inc., Malvern, PA) in PBS, pH 7.0, con￾taining 10 mM cysteine and 5 mM EDTA. The reaction was stopped
with 20 mM iodoacetamide. The production of fragments having relative
molecular weight consistent with Fab and Fc fragments and degradation
ofintact IgG molecules was verified by Coomassie Blue staining ofsodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) slabs
(16), using 10% acrylamide for unreduced proteins and 12.5% for reduced
proteins. Although these gels showed no detectable intact IgG, the prep￾arations were diluted to 1 mg/ml in PBS, dialyzed against RPMI 1640,
and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with Sepharose-Staphylococcus aureus
protein A to remove Fc fragments as well as any last traces of intact IgG.
Protein-Sepharose adsorbents. Proteins were coupled to Sepharose
4B (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Div. of Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, NJ)
by the cyanogen bromide procedure to yield the following adsorbents:
Sepharose-human IgG (7.59 mg/ml Sepharose beads), Sepharose-myo￾globin (2.1 mg/ml), Sepharose-ovalbumin (1.75 mg/ml), and Sepharose
goat F(ab')2 anti-murine Ig (1 mg/ml). S. aureus protein A-Sepharose
CL-4B was purchased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals. Human IgG was
prepared as described above. Sperm whale myoglobin and ovalbumin
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Goat F(ab')2 anti-murine Ig
(reactive with IgG, IgA, IgM, heavy and light chains) was purchased
from Cappel Laboratories Inc., Malvern, PA. The latter F(ab')2 antibody,
in soluble form, was also used as a second antibody in receptor-bridging
studies (see below).
Platelets and U937 cells. Washed platelets were prepared by a mod￾ification (17) of a published method (18) from blood freshly collected
by gravity into citrate anticoagulant from male donors who had not
taken aspirin or related antirheumatic drugs for 2 wk, or ethanol for 24
h. The platelets were washed twice in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.3, containing
6.6 mM EDTA and 2% BSA, and twice more in Tyrode's/EDTA, followed
by surface radiolabeling (see below). Platelets used for functional assays
were washed the same way, except that all four washes with Tyrode's/
EDTA contained 2% BSA. Since the platelet aggregation responses tested
here require extracellular calcium, the washed platelets in Tyrode's/
EDTA/BSA were spun and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.3, con￾2. Preliminary experiments indicate that this antibody precipitates two
surface proteins from human platelets. Their approximate molecular
weights are 125,000-135,000 and 110,000-120,000 (reduced), and
140,000-145,000 and 90,000-100,000 (unreduced) (D. C. Phipps, S. I.
Rosenfeld, and J. P. Leddy, unpublished observations).
taining 2 mM CaC12 and 2% BSA. The platelets were counted electron￾ically, adjusted to 300,000/mm3 in the same buffer, and held at room
temperature (RT) until tested. For platelets involved in Fcy receptor
solubilization, the purity of the platelet preparation was assessed. Elec￾tronic counting ofwashed platelets (4.47 X 105/mm3) revealed leukocyte
contamination of -600/mm3 (0.134% of the platelet count) and eryth￾rocyte contamination at 1 X 104/mm3. Microscopic examination of
Wright's stained cytocentrifuge smears demonstrated that the great ma￾jority of contaminating leukocytes were lymphocytes, e.g., in the prep￾aration used in Fig. 1, there were 73% lymphocytes, 25% monocytes,
and 2% neutrophils. Independent analysis by flow microfluorimetry has
revealed no demonstrable binding of anti-p40 to normal peripheral blood
lymphocytes (Looney, R. J., D. H. Ryan, and C. L. Anderson, unpub￾lished observations). U937 cells were grown and prepared for radiolabeling
as previously described (19).
Surface-radioiodination ofplatelets and U937 cells. Washed platelets
(2 X 109) in 0.7 ml Tyrode's buffer containing 6.6 mM EDTA were
added to a flat-bottomed glass vial precoated with 5 gg chloroglycouril
(Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) followed by 1 mCi carrier-free Na'211
(Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL). After a 30-min incubation at
room temperature, the reaction was quenched by addition of 5 mM KI
in Tyrode's/EDTA. The platelets were immediately transferred to a clean
tube, washed twice in the same buffer, transferred to a second tube, and
washed one more time in Tyrode's/EDTA/KI. U937 cells (1 X 107) were
radiolabeled in similar fashion (11, 19).
Pelleted labeled platelets or U937 cells were solubilized in 2.0 ml or
0.2 ml, respectively, of a pH 7.1-buffer mixture containing 1% NP-40,
20 mM Tris, 110 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM KI, 10lg/ml pep￾statin, 10 Ag/ml chymostatin, 10 Ag/ml leupeptin, 10 Ag/ml antipain,
and 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride (all inhibitors from Sigma
Chemical Co.). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysates were sub￾jected to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatants
were recovered and held on ice. The percentage of radioactivity precip￾itable by 12.5% TCA was determined: platelets, 25-42% (seven experi￾ments); U937 cells, 4.8-5.4% (two experiments).
Receptor isolation using monoclonal anti-p40. 100 Al lysate was in￾cubated (1 h on ice) with 50 tl undiluted anti-p40 (IV.3) in culture
supernatant (see above) or with control murine antibodies or immu￾noglobulins. The mixtures were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge
tubes containing 25 Al packed Sepharose-goat F(ab')2 anti-murine Ig that
had been washed twice with 1 ml 1% NP-40/5 mM KI in PBS. After
incubation for I h on ice with mixing at 10-min intervals, the Sepharose
was washed five times in PBS containing 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM
KI, and 0.02% NaN3. The contents were transferred to fresh tubes and
washed one more time in the same buffer mixture. The Sepharose pellets
were suspended in 80 gl Laemmli's (16) sample buffer containing 2%
SDS with or without 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Pierce Chemical Co.),
in place of 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by mixing and boiling for 2
min. Addition of 5 Al I M iodoacetamide (Sigma Chemical Co.) was
followed by microcentrifugation (Beckman Instruments Inc., Spinco Div.,
Palo Alto, CA) for 30 s. The supernatants were removed and applied to
a 5-15% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel in 0.1% SDS. The gels were
stained with Coomassie Blue, dried on filter paper, and then analyzed
by autoradiography using XAR-2 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester,
NY). Unlabeled high and low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad Lab￾oratories, Richmond, CA) included myosin (200,000), ,j-galactosidase
(130,000), phosphorylase B (94,000), BSA (68,000), ovalbumin (43,000),
carbonic anhydrase (30,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21,000), and
lysozyme (14,300). Radiolabeled BSA was included for alignment ofthe
autoradiographs.
Receptor isolation using Sepharose-IgG. Sepharose-IgG and other
(control) Sepharose conjugates were washed sequentially with PBS con￾taining 1 mg/ml BSA, PBS alone, 0.5 M acetic acid, PBS alone (twice),
and twice with PBS containing 1% NP-40 and 5 mM KI. Packed Se￾pharose-IgG (or control Sepharose), 25,l, was incubated at 2-4°C with
100 Ail radiolabeled lysate with mixing. Incubation times varied from 1
h to overnight. Both shorter and longer incubation times yielded the p40
protein from Sepharose-IgG, but nonspecific protein bands (eluted from
2318 Rosenfeld, Looney, Leddy, Phipps, Abraham, and Anderson

both Sepharose-IgG and control Sepharose conjugates) were more pro￾nounced when overnight incubation was employed. After incubation the
adsorbents were washed five times with PBS containing 1% NP-40 and
5 mM KI, transferred to fresh tubes, and washed a sixth time. Elution
of bound proteins and SDS-PAGE autoradiography were the same as
for the monoclonal antibody procedure.
Platelet aggregometry. Freshly isolated washed platelets, 450 Ad, at
300,000/mm3, were mixed in aggregometer cuvettes, with 10 !d of varying
dilutions (in Tyrode's/Ca++/BSA) of anti-p40 (IV.3) or with control an￾tibodies or murine IgG2b, and incubated at RT for 10 min. The cuvettes
were then placed in a dual channel recording aggregometer (Chrono￾Log, Havertown, PA) at 370C with stirring. After I min, platelet aggre￾gating agents, in 50 ul vol, were added. These included heat-aggregated
human IgG (5 mg/ml), collagen (-0.5 mg/ml), thrombin (-0.2 U/ml),
or ADP (50 gM) plus fibrinogen (8 mg/ml) (all initial concentrations).
Negative responses were followed for 15 min. Results were recorded as:
(a) the maximal slope of the change in light transmission per unit time
(expressed as the fraction of the maximum possible deflection per 0.2-
min interval); (b) the time to onset of aggregation after addition of the
stimulus; and (c) the amplitude of the upstroke of the aggregometer
curve estimated graphically. We have found that the slope is the single
best quantitative correlate of these responses, although the amplitude
measurement (percent aggregation) gives similar results.
Anti-p40 itself did not induce platelet aggregation, at least over the
dose range employed. Bridging experiments with a second antibody were
carried out by a modification of the above procedure. After 10 Ad diluted
anti-p4O (IV.3) had been incubated (RT, 10 min) with 450 A1 washed
platelets, 50 gI F(ab')2 goat anti-mouse Ig (60 gg/ml) were added at
37°C, and the mixture was observed for platelet aggregation in parallel
with appropriate control mixtures (see below). In such experiments pos￾itive results were followed by repeat application of the same antibody
concentrations in the presence of apyrase (64 jsg/ml) in order to distin￾guish ADP-dependent platelet aggregation from agglutination of platelets.
Results
Detergent-solubilized platelets were sequentially exposed to the
murine IgG2b MAb anti-p4O (IV.3) and solid phase F(ab')2 goat
anti-mouse Ig, and the complexes were eluted by 2% SDS in
the presence or absence of 20 mM DTT. Analysis of the eluates
by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE slab gels consistently revealed
a protein ofMr 40,000 in similar position to that of p40 extracted
from concurrently studied U937 cells (Fig. 1, left, lanes C, and
D, and G, and H). Neither platelet p4O nor U937-p4O appeared
to be derived from a higher molecular weight multichain protein
since reduction had only a slight effect on apparent molecular
weight. Other bands faintly visible in the specific anti-p4O track
are also seen in the tracks of eluates derived by exposure to
control murine IgG2b (MOPC- 141) prior to the solid phase goat
F(ab')2 anti-murine Ig (Fig. 1, left, lanes A, and B, and E, and
F). The p4O band, however, was not recovered when either
MOPC- 141 (Fig. 1) or IgG2b murine MAb anti-Vkiiib (not
shown) was used in place of anti-p4O (IV.3).
The platelet preparation used for this experiment contained
a small number of monocytes (0.034% of the platelet count).
Since monocytes contain about the same amount of anti-p40
as do U937 cells, (Looney, R. J., and C. L. Anderson, unpub￾lished observations) the contaminating monocytes could con￾tribute to lanes C and D (Fig. 1, left) no more than 0.7% of the
p40 seen in lanes G and H (Fig. 1, left), clearly much less than
the amount actually found in lanes C and D.
Extraction of detergent-solubilized, surface-labeled platelets
by an alternative method based on affinity for IgG-Sepharose
(Methods) also yielded p4O in eluates from surface-labeled

higher molecular weight, seen in the autoradiograph were also
found in eluates derived from the nonspecific adsorbents, Se￾pharose-myoglobin (Fig. 1, right, lane B) or Sepharose-ovalbu￾min (not shown). However, p4O was not recovered from the
latter adsorbents. The p72 glycoprotein, which had previously
been identified in U937 cells and normal human monocytes
and was associated with high affinity binding of monomeric IgG
(I 1, 19, 20), was not recovered from platelet lysates exposed to
Sepharose-IgG (Fig. 1, right, lane A). As expected, U937 cells
yielded both p40 and p72 bands under these same conditions
(Fig. 1, right, lane C). The p40 band was identified with anti￾p4O (IV.3) in platelets from three different donors and with IgG￾Sepharose in two of these plus one other donor (total of four
different donors tested).
To establish that this newly identified 40,000-mol-wt platelet
membrane protein was associated with biological responses at￾tributable to an Fcy receptor, the following studies were per￾formed. First, MAb anti-p4O (IV.3) and murine myeloma protein
of the same IgG2b subclass (MOPC- 141), both chromatograph￾ically purified from ascites fluid (Methods), were compared in
dose-responsive fashion for their capacity to inhibit platelet ag￾gregation by aggregated human IgG. Freshly prepared suspen￾sions of washed platelets were preincubated (10 min, RT) in
aggregometer cuvettes with varying concentrations of anti-p4O
or MOPC-141, after which the cuvettes were placed in the ag￾gregometer at 370C and aggregated IgG was added. Fig. 2 illus￾trates typical aggregometer tracings for single concentrations of
anti-p4O and MOPC- 141. Superimposed on the positive platelet
aggregation tracing (curve A) are the dimensions (y, x) used to
calculate maximum slope (Methods). Table I summarizes the
slopes for the full dose ranges over which IgG2b anti-p4O (IV.3)
and MOPC-141 IgG2b were compared. Anti-p4O was able to

thrombin or by collagen, was unaffected by intact anti-p40 at
several concentrations that totally inhibited the responses to ag￾gregated IgG (not shown).

Anti-p40 Fab fragments also effectively inhibited platelet re￾sponses to aggregated IgG although the protein concentrations
required were 10-12-fold higher than for intact anti-p40 (Table
I). Protein concentrations for Fab preparations are calculated
from the concentration of the original undigested preparation.
Fab from MOPC-141 IgG2b was not significantly inhibitory at
concentrations as high as 21.7 gg/ml.
Inhibition of platelet responses to aggregated IgG by intact
anti-p40 was obtained using platelets from four different donors;
inhibition with Fab fragments was successful with each of two
platelet donors.
As a control for the possibility that binding of antibody to
platelets at sites unrelated to Fc receptors might nonspecifically
depress platelet responsiveness to aggregated IgG, another murine
(IgG 1) monoclonal antibody, UR- 1, was tested. This MAb has
been found by flow cytometry to be selectively reactive with
platelets among all cell types in human blood (15), but the mem￾brane antigen that it recognizes has not yet been characterized.2
In initial dose-response studies, addition of undiluted UR-l as￾cites fluid (10 ,l) to washed platelets (450 ,ul) in the aggregometer
induced a rapid increase in light transmission. Since this was
only slightly affected by prior addition of apyrase, this reaction
may represent agglutination rather than aggregation. In any
event, a 1/4 dilution of UR-1 (tested in the same reaction vol￾umes) produced no observable direct effect on platelets but was
assumed to bind at a subagglutinating level. Subsequent addition
of aggregated human IgG, however, produced prompt aggre￾gation that was fully comparable with that of control platelets
(not shown).
Mab anti-p40 did not directly induce platelet aggregation,
at least in the concentrations employed. When washed platelets
that had been pretreated (10 min, RT) with anti-p40 (43 ng/ml
final concentration) were exposed to a second bridging antibody,
i.e., goat F(ab')2 anti-murine IgG, prompt apyrase-sensitive ag￾gregation was observed (Fig. 3). Appropriate controls using
MOPC-141 or UR-l as the first "antibody" prior to the F(ab')2
goat antibody, or addition of the F(ab')2 goat antibody alone,
yielded no observable aggregation. We have found that the min￾imum concentration of intact anti-p40 mediating full inhibition

of platelet aggregation by aggregated IgG is very similar to the
minimum concentration permitting platelet aggregation by re￾ceptor bridging via goat F(ab')2 antibody. The fact that apyrase
inhibited this reaction indicates that ADP was required. There￾fore the platelet aggregation was an active process, requiring
platelet secretion, as opposed to the passive, apyrase-insensitive
agglutination produced by UR-1 (see above).
Discussion
Human platelets have been shown to possess a previously un￾described 40,000-mol-wt membrane protein for which the fol￾lowing evidence is consistent with its function as an Fcy receptor.
First, p40 is at least partially expressed on the cell surface, as
demonstrated by consistent surface labeling. Second, it is im￾munoprecipitated from detergent lysates of platelets by MAb
anti-p40 (IV.3) which had been shown to inhibit Fcy receptor￾dependent rosette formation with IgG-coated erythrocytes by
Fc-y-receptor-bearing histiocytic (U937) and erythroid (K562)
human cell lines and by normal human monocytes, and to pre￾cipitate very similar, if not identical, surface-labeled membrane
proteins from each of these cell types (9). Third, p40 is also
recovered in eluates when detergent-lysed platelets are applied
to the affinity adsorbent, IgG-Sepharose, but not in eluates from
other protein-Sepharose conjugates. Fourth, and most impor￾tantly, MAb anti-p4O or its Fab fragments can completely but
selectively block platelet aggregation induced by heat-aggregated
human IgG under conditions wherein similar and 1000-fold
greater concentrations of murine myeloma IgG or Fab of the
same subclass (IgG2b) are ineffective, and an unrelated murine
IgG 1 anti-human platelet antibody fails to block this function.
Fifth, although the tested concentrations of intact MAb anti￾p40 did not induce platelet aggregation directly, addition of a
second bridging antibody in the form ofgoat F(ab')2 anti-mouse
Ig did induce platelet aggregation, suggesting that the p40 protein
possesses transmembrane linkage for cellular secretion and ac￾tivation. The p72 class of Fcy receptors demonstrated on U937
cells and human monocytes (11, 19) was not found on platelets.
Cheng and Hawiger (8) have described a 255,000-mol-wt
multichain protein solubilized from unlabeled human platelets
by a chaotropic agent (2 M KBr) without detergent and isolated
by affinity chromatography on Fc(IgG)-Sepharose. This protein
yielded a single 50,000-mol-wt polypeptide chain upon reduc￾tion. Reactivity of the unreduced 255,000-mol-wt protein with
1251I-aggregated IgG was demonstrated in sucrose gradient ultra￾centrifugation. The relationship, if any, of this 255,000-mol-wt
protein to our p40 is not evident. Although the 50,000-mol-wt
polypeptide chain obtained by reduction is close in apparent
molecular weight to p40, we found no evidence that p40 was
derived from a higher molecular weight protein by disulfide re￾duction either in platelets or U937 cells. It is possible that human
platelets possess more than one class of Fc-y receptor, as has
emerged for mononuclear phagocytes of both human (9, 10)
and mouse (21, 22). On the other hand, our anti-p40 MAb did
totally block platelet responses to aggregated IgG. It is conceivable
that p40 is the ligand recognition unit of a larger multiprotein
complex that can maintain its multicomponent structure in the
less stringent conditions of Cheng and Hawiger (8). This idea
has precedent in the proposed multisubunit structure ofthe high
affinity IgE receptors of rat mast cells and basophils (23, 24).
As a candidate for the platelet Fc-y receptor (or at least its
ligand-binding unit), the currently known properties of p40
would be consistent with other observations. As an IgG-binding
membrane protein in normal human monocytes (9, 10) and,
more recently, in granulocytes (Looney, R. J., and C. L. An￾derson, unpublished observations), p40 functions essentially as
an IgG aggregate receptor, with very low affinity for monomeric
IgG. Karas et al. (7) have reported that human platelets bind
radiolabeled monomeric IgG very poorly and that only IgG di￾mers or small oligomers demonstrated stable binding. These
findings, in turn, were in agreement with earlier observations of
Ginsberg and Henson (25) that IgG aggregates of dimer to tet￾ramer size are effective stimuli for human platelets. Indeed, in
human platelets we have found no evidence for the p72 class of
Fc-y receptors possessing high affinity (Ka = 10'-109 M-') for
monomeric IgG (1 1, 20).
Cellular activation by anti-receptor antibody has previously
been observed in several systems (26-30). In these examples a
single application of a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody was
effective, whereas in our studies (Fig. 3) a second goat F(ab')2
anti-murine Ig antibody was employed. Although we did not
test high concentrations of monoclonal anti-p40 (IV.3) alone,
because of limited supply, the concentrations tested were equal
to those effecting total inhibition of platelet responses to aggre￾gated IgG. We consider it more likely that the need for a second
bridging antibody is related to questions of epitope density or
accessibility on neighboring p40 molecules, or to the overall
density of p40 proteins in platelet membranes.
It will be of interest in future studies with the anti-p40 MAb
(or its Fab fragments) (a) to compare the (maximum) number
of surface-expressed p40 molecules per platelet with the Fc'y
receptor estimates obtained by dimeric IgG binding (7), (b) to
probe in greater detail the mechanism of platelet aggregation by
Fc'y receptor bridging, and (c) to explore the relationship, if any,
of p40 to extensively studied major glycoproteins of the platelet
membrane such as GP Ib (31, 32).
Note added in proof MAb 3G8, which recognizes a 52-68,000-mol-wt
Fcy receptor on human neutrophils, was kindly provided by Dr. Howard
Fleit, Department of Pathology, State University of New York, Stony
Brook, NY. Using this MAb for immunoprecipitation ofsurface-labeled
human platelet lysates, the 52-68,000-mol-wt protein was not identified,
which confirmed prior unpublished observations with immunofluores￾cence (H. Fleit and J. Unkeless, personal communication).
