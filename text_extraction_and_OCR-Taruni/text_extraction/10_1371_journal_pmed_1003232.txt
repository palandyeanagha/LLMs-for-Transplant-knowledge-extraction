Abstract
Background
Obesity is closely related to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
(T2D). The prevention of T2D has become imperative to stem the rising rates of this dis￾ease. Weight loss is highly effective in preventing T2D; however, the at-risk pool is large,
and a clinically meaningful metric for risk stratification to guide interventions remains a chal￾lenge. The objective of this study is to predict T2D risk using full-information continuous
analysis of nationally sampled data from white and black American adults age �45 years.
Methods and findings
A sample of 12,043 black (33%) and white individuals from a population-based cohort, REa￾sons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) (enrolled 2003–2007),
was observed through 2013–2016. The mean participant age was 63.12 ± 8.62 years, and
43.7% were male. Mean BMI was 28.55 ± 5.61 kg/m2
. Risk factors for T2D regularly
recorded in the primary care setting were used to evaluate future T2D risk using Bayesian
logistic regression. External validation was performed using 9,710 participants (19% black)
from Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) (enrolled 1987–1989), observed through
1996–1998. The mean participant age in this cohort was 53.86 ± 5.65 years, and 44.6%
were male. Mean BMI was 27.15 ± 4.92 kg/m2
. Predictive performance was assessed using
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) statis￾tics. The primary outcome was incident T2D. By 2016 in REGARDS, there were 1,602 inci￾dent cases of T2D. Risk factors used to predict T2D progression included age, sex, race,
BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and blood glucose. The

Data Availability Statement: This study uses data
from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. In order

Bayesian logistic model (AUC = 0.79) outperformed the Framingham risk score (AUC =
0.76), the American Diabetes Association risk score (AUC = 0.64), and a cardiometabolic
disease system (using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) (AUC = 0.75). Validation in ARIC
was robust (AUC = 0.85). Main limitations include the limited generalizability of the
REGARDS sample to black and white, older Americans, and no time to diagnosis for T2D.
Conclusions
Our results show that a Bayesian logistic model using full-information continuous predictors
has high predictive discrimination, and can be used to quantify race- and sex-specific T2D
risk, providing a new, powerful predictive tool. This tool can be used for T2D prevention
efforts including weight loss therapy by allowing clinicians to target high-risk individuals in a
manner that could be used to optimize outcomes.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Obesity affects approximately 42% of the US population and causes significant morbid￾ity, including a marked increase in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and
varies by sex and race.
• Weight loss is effective in preventing T2D, but the at-risk pool is large and weight loss
interventions are time-consuming and costly.
• A simple tool to identify those at risk for developing T2D is needed.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We performed a Bayesian logistic regression study using data from the national
REGARDS (2003–2016) and ARIC (1987–1998) cohorts in the United States for risks
associated with T2D in black and white American adults.
• We investigated 8 demographic and metabolic syndrome risk factors for T2D and
incorporated Bayesian hierarchical techniques into the development of a risk prediction
calculation.
• These 8 simple traits showed improved ability to predict progression to T2D compared
to other commonly used paradigms, and can be used in clinical settings to target those
at high risk for developing T2D.
What do these findings mean?
• Using a different methodology, with simple, objective traits regularly measured in a
clinical setting (by tests that can be performed by non-specialists), we showed that

Introduction
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to rise, creating a greater burden in patients
and adverse impacts in public health [1]. The rising prevalence of T2D is linked to escalating
rates of obesity, and both T2D and obesity disproportionately affect certain populations, often
along social, demographic, or economic lines. For example, non-Hispanic black Americans
are affected by T2D with almost double the prevalence (13.4%) of non-Hispanic whites (7.3%),
and also exhibit higher rates of obesity—particularly when comparing black and white women
(13.2% versus 6.8%, respectively) [1].
Strategies for effective T2D prevention have become critically important to reduce the
impact of this disease. A robust body of evidence is conclusive that weight loss is highly effec￾tive in preventing T2D—regardless of whether weight loss is achieved through lifestyle therapy
[2], anti-obesity medications [3], or bariatric surgery [4]. However, the challenge that remains
is 2-fold: First, sustained weight loss using the current tools of obesity management are labor
intensive on the part of both the healthcare team and the patient, and, second, the at-risk pool
of patients for T2D is quite large. By way of illustration, the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) demonstrated that, in 2013–2014, 70.7% of US adults had
overweight or obesity and 34.2% had metabolic syndrome, and all these individuals are at high
risk of developing T2D [1].
Clearly, risk stratification approaches are needed to identify those at highest risk of T2D,
and to optimize the benefit/risk ratio and cost-effectiveness of the application of weight loss
therapy in the prevention of T2D. The majority of risk assessment strategies use binary predic￾tors for risk factors, including those employed by National Cholesterol Education Program
Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) [5]. Discretizing continuous predictors can result in the
loss of valuable information and reduce the clinical usefulness of the predictive model [6]. For
example, the risk conferred by metabolic syndrome traits exists over a spectrum of values, and
binary responses do not adequately classify T2D risk over the quantitative range of risk factors
[7]. Finally, the predictive value of various risk factors and risk scores may not be generalizable
from one population to another. In particular, African Americans have been understudied
with respect to risk models, score development, replication, and validation [8].
Guo et al. [9] earlier developed a cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) system using
binary predictors using data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) [10] and Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) [11] cohorts to predict inci￾dent T2D with specificity for sex and race. CMDS was developed using quantitative measures
of metabolic syndrome traits (i.e., ATP III criteria) [12], with the limitation that these cohorts
were not designed as nationally representative. Additionally, a binary prediction approach
such as this does not fully take into account the risk conferred by cardiometabolic disease
manifestations due to pathophysiological processes of adipocyte dysfunction, systemic inflam￾mation, and oxidative stress [13]. There have been attempts to observe an association between
metabolic syndrome z-scores and risk of future T2D using a continuous metabolic severity

score [14]. However, these analyses fitted separate logistic models for each metabolic syn￾drome trait and did not consider possible interactions, such as between high-density lipopro￾tein (HDL) and triglycerides [15].
Our current objective was to create a highly predictive score that rigorously captures race
and sex differences in T2D risk. This was done using a large national cohort of black and white
Americans from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS)
study. We compared the predictive ability of a CMDS T2D prediction model using individual
laboratory and anthropometric measurements as continuous functions with Bayesian logistic
regression. We also compared the predictive accuracy of enhanced CMDS with other existing
T2D prediction scores by looking at receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area
under the curve (AUC) statistics. The purpose of this analysis is to create a tool using quantita￾tive predictors available in real-world clinical practice that identifies individuals who are most
likely to benefit from therapies to prevent T2D. The application of CMDS allows clinicians
treating those with overweight/obesity to target effective weight loss strategies in those at high￾est risk of T2D, in order to optimize the benefit/risk ratio and cost-effectiveness of
interventions.
Methods
The institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham designated this
analysis as not human subjects research and waived the need for approval. The analyses were
prespecified and approved by the REGARDS committee. This study is reported as per the
Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diag￾nosis guideline (S1 TRIPOD Checklist).
Study populations
The enhanced CMDS model was developed in REGARDS and externally validated in ARIC.
REGARDS was chosen as it is one of the largest and most recent surveys of black and white
adults that collected information relevant to T2D risk. ARIC was chosen for external validation
as it is a recent longitudinal scientific sample of black and white Americans. These analyses
used only de-identified data.
REGARDS. The REGARDS study is an ongoing longitudinal survey designed to look at
stroke mortality of black and white Americans. The design has been reported elsewhere [16].
In this scientific sample from the US, a total of 30,239 black and white men and women age 45
years and older from 48 states and the District of Columbia were enrolled between 2003 and
2007. Participants were interviewed by telephone, followed by an in-home visit for physiologi￾cal measures and obtaining biosamples, at baseline, and then observed for a median follow-up
duration of 9.5 ± 0.9 years (second in-home visit, 2013–2016). Follow-up time is rounded to
10 years for reporting. Information on incident T2D was collected at baseline and follow-up.
We restricted the analysis to those without T2D at baseline who had completed the second in￾home visit. Between the first and second visit, 5,713 individuals died, and 8,532 withdrew from
further follow-up, leaving a population of 15,938 with follow-up data available. Individuals
with T2D at baseline (n = 3,260) and those missing relevant covariate information at baseline
(n = 635) were excluded, leaving a final study population of 12,043 individuals. Site institu￾tional review boards approved the protocol, and informed consent was obtained.
Collection of blood specimens, physical measurements, and urine was performed using
standardized methods. Participants were asked to fast for 10–12 hours before the visit
(n = 9,332). Those who did not fast (n = 1,440) or had no information on fasting (n = 1,271)
were included as non-fasters. T2D was defined by fasting blood glucose level � 7.0 mmol/l,

non-fasting blood glucose � 11.1 mmol/l, self-reported T2D, or being on diabetes medication.
Race was defined by self-report as black or white. Standardized blood pressure was taken twice
in-home and calculated as the average of the 2 measurements. Lipids were assayed using either
the fasting or non-fasting sample.
ARIC. The ARIC study is a longitudinal, ongoing prospective study initiated in 1987 [17].
ARIC includes 15,792 black and white men and women age 45–64 years at baseline from 4 US
communities: Jackson, Mississippi; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
and Washington County, Maryland. Individuals were interviewed at 4 distinct follow-up time
points between 1990 and 2013. We restricted this analysis to 2 time points (1987–1989 and
1996–1998), matching the length of follow-up in REGARDS. Information on T2D was col￾lected at both time points—those with T2D at baseline and/or missing relevant covariate infor￾mation were excluded, along with those lost to follow-up or death; the final population
included 9,710 individuals.
Analysis of fasting and plasma specimens was performed at central laboratories. For inci￾dent T2D, we included those with self-report of T2D or being on T2D medication, as
described by the ARIC protocol [18]. Site institutional review boards approved the study at
each site, and informed consent was obtained.
Predictors used to determine T2D risk
In order to predict future T2D we relied on objective, quantitative traits commonly available
in clinical care venues, particularly in patients presenting with obesity or metabolic syndrome:
blood glucose, BMI and waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood
pressure (DBP), HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides [19]. We assessed these traits as continuous
predictors. Additionally, in order to improve clinical and general applications of the score, we
examined, using correlation matrices and AUC, whether substituting BMI for waist circumfer￾ence changed predictive ability.
Statistical methods
We used Bayesian logistic regression models to analyze our data by jointly fitting prespecified
predictors and/or their interactions. Following Gelman et al. [20], we used weakly informative
Cauchy priors, which have the advantage of providing minimal prior information to constrain
the coefficients in a reasonable range, stabilizing the model fitting, and improving the model
prediction performance [20,21]. We fitted the Bayesian logistic regression models with Cauchy
priors by incorporating an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm into the usual
iteratively weighted least squares used in classical logistic regression. For large datasets and
only a few predictors, conventional logistic regression may perform similarly to Bayesian logis￾tic regression. However, Bayesian models with weakly informative priors can provide more
reliable results if there are problems of correlation and overfitting.
We built a Bayesian logistic model using REGARDS and evaluated its predictive values in
ARIC. We used several measures to assess the predictive performance, including AUC, mean
squared error, and misclassification [22,23]. We compared the main-effect model, with only
the main effects of the predictors mentioned above, with the interacting model, which
included all the main effects and also multiple interactions, including sex × race, SBP × DBP,
HDL × triglycerides, waist circumference × BMI, BMI × HDL, and BMI × triglycerides. We
also tested if using mean arterial pressure conferred any benefit over SBP and DBP. The model
fitting and predictive evaluation were implemented using R package BhGLM (Bayesian hierar￾chical generalized linear models) (https://github.com/nyiuab/BhGLM) [24].

We also compared our method with several other predictive modeling methods, including lasso,
generalized additive modeling, random forests, and support vector machine learning (S1 Text). We
found that our Bayesian logistic model outperformed these alternative approaches (S1 Table).
To create a useable, interactive instrument, we calculated the predictive risk probabilities
based on the fitted Bayesian logistic model, allowing one to simply input an individual’s actual
data into a computer program and receive a risk probability based on his/her personal anthro￾pometric, demographic, and laboratory values. The formula for calculating the predictive risk
probabilities of incident T2D can be found in S2 Text.
Comparisons to other risk scores
We compared the AUC from the Bayesian logistic model with the CMDS model [19] devel￾oped using discontinuous traits conforming with ATP III criteria. We also report the differ￾ences in AUC between the current Bayesian logistic model and the Framingham [25] and
American Diabetes Association [26] risk scores. We recalculated the AUC for these scores
using logistic regression methods and available REGARDS data; we were unable to include
family history, as it is a somewhat subjective and nonquantitative variable that is unavailable
for REGARDS participants.
Results
Baseline characteristics of study participants are reported in Table 1. In REGARDS, 12,043 eli￾gible participants without T2D at baseline completed the follow-up examination and had

complete data on relevant covariates (mean age 63.1 years, range 45–92 years; 33% black).
During a follow-up time ranging from 7.4 to 13.4 years (median 9.5 ± 0.9 years), there were
1,602 cases of new T2D (13.3%). Approximately 75% of participants were overweight or had
obesity. Ranges of all variables included are reported in S2 Table.
For external validation using ARIC, 9,710 participants completed the follow-up examina￾tion (mean age 53.9 years, range 45–66 years; 19% black) and had complete data on relevant
covariates. During a follow-up time of 10 years, there were 927 cases of new T2D (9.5%).
Almost 65% of participants had overweight or obesity.
Black females had the highest incidence of T2D in REGARDS (18.7%) and ARIC (16.3%);
white females had the lowest (9.2% and 6.4%). Black females had the highest prevalence of obe￾sity in both surveys, using both BMI (51% and 43%) and elevated waist circumference (64%
and 74%). In terms of cardiometabolic risk profile, 34% of people in REGARDS presented
with metabolic syndrome, 33% in ARIC.
The fitted models and their predictive values
Results from the fitted Bayesian logistic model with main effects are presented in Table 2. The
model fitted in REGARDS had an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.78–0.80). External validation using
the model generated in REGARDS was conducted in the ARIC cohort, for which the AUC was
0.85 (95% CI 0.83–0.86). This model included the variables of SBP, DBP, blood glucose, BMI,
HDL, triglycerides, age (45–92 years), sex (male or female), and race (black or white). Impor￾tantly, this model incorporated risk conferred over the continuum of values for each risk factor
as well as the effect that age, race, and sex have on the contributions of the factors to overall
T2D risk.

Predicting T2D in a nationwide cohort using Bayesian Logistic Regression Modelling

We did not observe significant improvements in AUC and other measures when including
interactions in the predictive model, and, in fact, only observed a mild improvement when
interacting sex and race with main effects, where the AUC went from 0.789 (main effects with
sex and race included as main effects, no interaction) to 0.794 (interaction). Inclusion of inter￾actions involving SBP and DBP, HDL and triglycerides, and waist circumference and BMI did
not enhance the predictive accuracy, nor did the substitution of mean arterial pressure for
DBP and SBP.
Fig 1 shows the estimated odds ratios (ORs) of incident T2D for individual risk factors in
REGARDS based on the main-effect model. All factors used to construct the fitted model,
except for sex and DBP, significantly impact the risk of T2D. While these other factors signifi￾cantly provide additional information about T2D risk when added to the model, the risk fac￾tors associated with the greatest impact on odds of future T2D were blood glucose (OR 1.06,
95% CI 1.06 to 1.07) and race (white, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.71).
Correlation of parameters: Waist circumference and BMI
Waist circumference and BMI are similarly correlated with T2D risk (waist circumference corre￾lation coefficient [CC] 0.19; BMI CC 0.19). Additionally, waist circumference and BMI are corre￾lated with each other (CC 0.74). Although waist circumference is not routinely assessed in many
clinical venues, we alternatively analyzed its predictive power, and found that the AUC for the
model with waist circumference was 0.791, compared to 0.789 for the model with BMI. While
waist circumference did appear to confer a minimal improvement to the AUC, given the clinical
application of the Bayesian logistic model, BMI is an appropriate substitute for waist circumfer￾ence without substantial loss of predictability. In addition, we tested the correlation between all
other parameters: SBP and DBP showed a CC of 0.62; all other pairs of parameters had CC < 0.2.

as well as the Framingham (AUC 0.76) and American Diabetes Association (AUC 0.64) scor￾ing systems using logistic regression methods with variables available in REGARDS. The AUC
for the Bayesian logistic model, using continuous variables from REGARDS, was 0.79.
Predictive risk probabilities
Based on the fitted main-effect logistic model, we obtained a formula for calculating the proba￾bility of T2D for any individual given the values of the risk factors (S2 Text). Results for the
probability of T2D as predicted by each individual risk factor included in the final Bayesian
logistic model are displayed in Fig 3 over the continuum of values, stratified by sex and race.
There are several salient observations to be made. First, the data show that DBP and SBP con￾fer a higher probability of T2D over the entire range of values in black individuals compared
to white individuals and in females compared to males. Second, for any given level of HDL or
triglycerides, black individuals have a higher probability of T2D than white individuals; how￾ever, probabilities tend to equalize at the extremes of very high HDL and very low triglyceride
values. Third, probabilities appear nearly indistinguishable over the range of blood glucose,
BMI, HDL, and triglyceride values when males are compared with females. When black males
and females are compared with their white counterparts, the data for HDL and triglycerides
also visually appear indistinguishable. Finally, the probability of incident T2D declines as a
function of age; however, probabilities were higher at any given age in black individuals than
white individuals and, to a lesser extent, in females than males.
Finally, Fig 4 illustrates the distribution of risk among individuals in the population as a
function of race. The distribution of predicted probabilities is right-shifted towards higher risk
among black individuals (mean 0.19, median 0.14) compared with white individuals (mean

0.11, median 0.07). Furthermore, in both races, the validity of these predictions based on
observed frequencies is quite robust over the full range of predicted probability.
Discussion
In the current study, we present novel findings: (1) a practical and robust T2D risk calculation
for incident T2D based on metabolic syndrome criteria; (2) a tool with improved capability for
predicting progression to T2D compared with other commonly used paradigms (i.e., models
developed in the Framingham Heart Study and by the American Diabetes Association), and gen￾erated using only quantitative data readily available to the clinician; (3) the first risk prediction
tool, to our knowledge, for individuals of African descent derived from a large scientific US sam￾ple; (4) development and validation of the risk calculation model across 2 national cohorts in
both black and white men and women; and (5) a unique T2D risk model that incorporates
Bayesian hierarchical techniques into its risk prediction calculation. Metabolic syndrome traits
constitute the basis of the prediction model, and the high AUC values highlight insulin resistance
as the central pathophysiological process giving rise to these traits in the pathogenesis of T2D.
Quantitative and qualitative difference from other scores
This study substantially advances our previous work in smaller, regional cohorts, which dem￾onstrated that metabolic syndrome traits can be used to predict progression to T2D in

individuals with overweight or obesity. An earlier iteration of the idea for a tool that used met￾abolic syndrome trait thresholds assigned patients to 5 discreet risk strata and assumed that
each trait contributed equally to T2D risk [19]. To enhance the predictive value, the binary
predictors (i.e., values above and below threshold values) were differentially weighted based on
their ability to confer risk for T2D and used to generate a numerical risk score. The relative
proportion of risk attributable to each trait did vary as a function of race; however, the cohorts
were smaller than the REGARDS cohort and did not represent a national sample of black and
white individuals. The current version is a tool created using the Bayesian logistic regression
approach (implemented in BhGLM) that effectively weights the contribution to overall risk for
each factor over the continuum of values and incorporates effects of race and sex. Indeed, com￾pared with the previous iteration, for which the AUC for the ROC was 0.72 [19], the AUC was
improved to 0.79 when the model was fitted using REGARDS data. Also, by using the largest
black American cohort currently available for these types of studies, this tool now provides a
uniquely robust quantitative risk assessment in black Americans.
Clinical implications
The current Bayesian logistic model quantifies the 10-year risk for developing T2D. Weight
loss medications and structured lifestyle interventions designed to achieve weight loss have
been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing T2D among patients with overweight
or obesity [27]. Obesity, however, is highly prevalent, and weight loss interventions are labori￾ous and entail clinical costs. Risk assessment can be used to identify those individuals at high￾est risk of T2D in whom weight loss interventions will have a higher benefit/risk ratio and be
most cost-effective. More research is justified to assess the potential of our predictive model
for individualizing care and selecting interventions to prevent cardiometabolic disease. For
example, in a pooled study of 3,286 individuals who were overweight or had obesity participat￾ing in a clinical trial employing a weight loss medication (phentermine/topiramate extended
release), the earlier iteration of the T2D risk model [19] effectively stratified T2D risk, and
demonstrated that numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 case of T2D were markedly reduced
in participants with higher risk scores at baseline [3]. Therefore, the current model offers
healthcare professionals a more robust tool to assess T2D risk using quantitative clinical data
that would be available based on clinical practice guidelines for patients with obesity [28].
To enhance the clinical utility of this tool, we additionally examined whether BMI could be
substituted for waist circumference since waist circumference is not routinely measured in
clinical venues. We found that the substitution of BMI for waist circumference did result in a
minimal decrease in AUC; however, risk prediction remained robust such that BMI can be
substituted for waist circumference in risk prediction.
Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this study is the use of a large, nationally sampled, biracial cohort with
validation in a second cohort. The participants are well characterized, and only reproducible
quantitative data (e.g., as opposed to less reliable or subjective data such as family history or
reported physical activity) are used in generating the risk score. This allowed us to create a
more meaningful, interactive system using readily available clinical data, which can be applied
to quantify T2D risk in individual patients. Thus, this approach has clinical utility for identify￾ing those most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions to prevent T2D.
A limitation of this study is that we only have 2 time points from which to assess 10-year
risk of T2D; therefore, no time-to-event models were applied. Between the first and second
REGARDS survey, 8,532 participants withdrew from further follow-up; upon inspecting

demographic and metabolic profile (including the 8 traits examined) differences between
these 8,532 participants and those who remained, only baseline BMI and DBP showed no sig￾nificant difference. While the reasons for withdrawing from follow-up are unknown, previous
work in this population shows that missing data do not change exposure outcome relation￾ships in a study such as REGARDS [29]. Participants were only non-Hispanic white or non￾Hispanic black, so generalizability to other populations will require caution, and future studies
that address this issue would extend the racial/ethnic reach of risk assessment using our
model. The mean age of the REGARDS participants at baseline was 63.12 years, so generaliz￾ability to younger populations is not advised. We did not have physical activity or family his￾tory information, so were unable to input these when comparing this tool to the Framingham
and American Diabetes Association tools.
Conclusion
The tool presented here, using nationally sampled data from black and white Americans, has
high model discrimination using readily available quantitative clinical information. The pre￾dictive value is enhanced by adding race (black or white) data. This study also quantified the
differential contribution of metabolic syndrome traits to T2D risk among black and white men
and women, and established the first robust tool to our knowledge for predicting T2D among
individuals of African descent. Weight loss achieved by structured lifestyle interventions and
anti-obesity medications is highly effective in preventing progression to T2D [30–32]. This
tool can be used by clinicians and researchers to quantitatively assess T2D risk among patients
with overweight/obesity. Hopefully, rational strategies for the medical care of patients with
obesity based on risk will lead to greater access to evidence-based therapies.
