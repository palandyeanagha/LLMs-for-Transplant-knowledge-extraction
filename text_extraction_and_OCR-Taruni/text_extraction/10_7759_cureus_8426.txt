Abstract
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and it has spread rapidly
across the world, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2
infection predominantly results in pulmonary issues, accumulating evidence suggests the increased
frequency of a variety of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Acute cardiac injury,
defined as elevated cardiac troponin levels, is the most reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19 and
strongly associated with mortality. In this article, we summarize the currently available data on the
association of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 with acute myocardial injury.

Introduction And Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Coronavirus
disease 2019
Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses belonging to the
family Coronaviridae, which are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals, and cause respiratory,
enteric, hepatic, and neurologic disease [1]. Six coronavirus species were previously known to cause human
disease [1]. Four viruses-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1-typically cause mild respiratory illness in
immunocompetent individuals; whereas, the other two betacoronaviruses-severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-have
been linked to fatal illnesses in the past two decades [1,2]. SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe
acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong province, China. MERS-CoV was the
pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East and has been
responsible for more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades; mortality rates of 10% for SARS￾CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV have been reported [1-3].
In December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of
Hubei province, China. These cases were epidemiologically linked to a local Huanan wholesale seafood
market [1,2]. A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through unbiased sequencing in
samples from patients with pneumonia. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel
enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, and later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, orthocoronavirinae subfamily
[1]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 has 89% genome sequence identity to a bat SARS-like
coronavirus, 80% identity to SARS and 50% identity to MERS coronavirus, thus making SARS-CoV-2 the
seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans, as well as the third coronavirus with bat
origins [4].
Since its initial identification, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
spread to more than 187 countries worldwide over the past few months [5]. Given the rapid spread of this
virus, with consequences on an international scale, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization on March 11, 2020 [6]. As of May 10, 2020, more than four million COVID-19 cases were
reported globally (including more than 1.3 million cases in the United States), which are associated with
more than 281,000 deaths to date [5]. Although SARS-CoV-2 appears to have a lower fatality rate than either
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks
combined, partly because of its greater infectivity (estimated reproductive number (R0) of between 2 and 3)
and higher attack rate, thus leading to more infected patients [6]. Evidence of person to person transmission
has been observed, primarily through close contact and respiratory droplets. The virus can be detected one
to two days before symptom onset in upper respiratory samples, and the median incubation period has been
estimated to be 5.1 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.5-5.8 days) [7]. Although most symptomatic
patients with COVID-19 present with fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, and show pneumonia on
imaging findings, approximately of ten percent of patients have a worsening of the disease, thus requiring
intensive care and possible complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), viremia, acute
cardiac injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multi-organ failure and subsequent death in
critically ill patients [8].
Definition of acute myocardial injury
Myocardial injury is defined as an elevation in cardiac biomarkers, cardiac troponin I (TnI) or troponin T
(TnT) above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, and is considered acute if there is a rise and/or
fall in cardiac troponin concentrations exceeding the biological and/or analytical variation; myocardial
injury may be secondary to ischemic or nonischemic processes [9,10]. Traditionally, elevated troponin
concentrations have been considered equivalent to myocardial infarction. However, with improvements in
troponin assays, elevated levels without overt symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia are now more
common; hence, the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction considers myocardial injury to be a
separate, unique entity [11]. Based on current evidence, a myocardial injury without overt ischemia
represents approximately 60% of cases of abnormal troponin elevation [9]. The differential diagnosis is

broad in such cases. It can be recognized in the variety of cardiac such as acute heart failure, pulmonary
embolism, myocarditis, cardiac surgery or procedures, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, stress-induced
cardiomyopathy, or several non-cardiac conditions such as acute renal failure, sepsis, anemia, hypoxia,
critical illness, drug-induced, rhabdomyolysis among others [9,10]. Association of viral infections with
myocardial injury has been well recognized, and the most common associations involve adenoviruses and
enteroviruses such as coxsackie viruses [12]. According to data from previous influenza virus and coronavirus
epidemics, these viral infections have also been shown to cause myocardial injury, because cases of
myocarditis have been described to be caused by both influenza and coronaviruses [13,14].
Although SARS-CoV-2 infection predominantly causes pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia and
ARDS, the disease has also been associated with a variety of cardiovascular complications, including acute
myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmia, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism [6]. Moreover,
studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an
increased risk of acquiring the illness and subsequently having severe disease and death [6,7]. In a clinical
bulletin issued by the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, but the
mortality reached 10.5% in patients with underlying CVD [15]. Among various cardiac complications, acute
cardiac injury with elevated cardiac biomarkers has been described in early studies from China on
hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We discuss the prevalence, mechanism, clinical characteristics,
management, and prognostic implications of SARS-COV-2-induced myocardial injury, according to current
published research.
Review
Cardiovascular complications with SARS-COV and MERS
SARS-CoV and MERS may also result in cardiovascular complications, although most of the data are
anecdotal, in the absence of systematic studies. Although SARS-CoV infection is associated with some
cardiovascular manifestations, there are no clear reported cases of myocarditis [16-19]. However, in the 2012
Saudi Arabia outbreak, MERS-CoV was reported to cause acute myocarditis and heart failure (Table 1) [14].

The earliest single-center retrospective study conducted in China, involving 41 hospitalized patients with
COVID-19, detected acute cardiac injury in five (12%) patients. In the study, a diagnosis of acute cardiac
injury was made if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper
reference limit, or new abnormalities were detected in electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography [1].
Since then, numerous retrospective studies reported an increased prevalence of myocardial injury in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with a frequency between 5% and 28% [1,20-25]. The prevalence of
cardiac injury increased with the severity of the disease (Table 3) [26-31].

However, data regarding troponin elevation in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, non-hospitalized
patients are not available.
Mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19
The mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. The following potential
mechanisms have been suggested.
1. SARS-CoV-2 Induced Direct Myocardial Injury
One potential mechanism is direct myocardial involvement mediated via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) [8,32]. The betacoronaviruses can infect human hosts through ACE2, a membrane-bound protein
expressed in many human cells, including vascular endothelia, renal tissue, cardiovascular tissue, and small
intestinal epithelia. ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system by inactivating angiotensin II,
and it is likely to protect against acute lung failure. A murine model has demonstrated that pulmonary
infection with SARS-CoV also precipitates ACE2‐dependent myocardial infarction. Among humans, during
the Toronto SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% of autopsied hearts, thus raising the
possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus [32]. Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2 has a very similar receptor binding domain/motif to that of the SARS coronavirus, thus
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to enter human cells and causes direct damage to
the lung epithelia, thereby leading to pneumonia and ARDS. Because ACE2 is also highly expressed in the
heart, COVID-19 induced cardiac injury might potentially be mediated by ACE2, although whether SARS￾CoV-2 binding alters ACE2 expression or causes dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(RAAS) pathway remains unclear [6,7,32,33]. Hence, one potential explanation for the higher likelihood of
acquiring infection, and the increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in patients with COVID￾19 with pre-existing CVD, maybe the elevated secretion of ACE2 in these patients, thus making them more
susceptible to direct viral damage to cardiac myocytes [33]; but, this has not yet been demonstrated in
pathology studies. In a case report describing autopsy results for a 50-year-old man who died of COVID-19
associated with ARDS, histologic examination of biopsied cardiac tissue showed rare interstitial
mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates without substantial myocardial damage. However, the troponin level
was not reported in the study [34].
2. SARS-CoV-2 Induced Overwhelming Inflammatory Response and Cytokine Storm
2020 B K et al. Cureus 12(6): e8426. DOI 10.7759/cureus.8426 4 of 10

Another suggested mechanism of COVID-19 related cardiac involvement is an overwhelming immune￾inflammatory response and cytokine storm [6,7,33]. The hallmark of cytokine storm syndrome is an
uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of
lymphocytes and macrophages [24]. Huang et al. have found that patients with COVID-19 admitted to the
intensive care unit have higher plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukins (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10,
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and IgG-induced protein 10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor α [1]. From a previous study of SARS￾CoV infection and cardiovascular complications, subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to
be common during acute SARS infection and to be reversible after recovery, thus suggesting that left
ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase might be associated with cytokine storm syndrome [18]. Several
studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 with myocardial injury show evidence of severe systemic
inflammation, including elevated leukocyte and neutrophil counts, interleukin levels, C-reactive protein,
procalcitonin, globulin, and biomarkers of myocardial injury and stress, such as creatine kinase and
myoglobin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), thus linking myocardial injury to
the severity of inflammation and subsequent ventricular dysfunction [24,25,35]. Similarly, in a case report of
SARS-CoV 2 induced fulminant myocarditis, the described patient had markedly elevated interleukin 6, thus
suggesting that the presence of cytokine storms might have caused increased vascular wall permeability and
myocardial edema, thus resulting in the observed thickening of the interventricular septum. Because the
myocarditis was transient, and recovery was enhanced with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy
(CRRT), myocardial injury can be considered to be associated with an excessive immune response mediated
by viral infection [36].
3. SARS-CoV-2 Induced Severe Hypoxia and Systemic Disturbances
Severe hypoxia due to acute lung injury and several systemic complications caused by the virus can result in
oxidative stress and hence secondary myocardial injury due to increased myocardial oxygen demand [7,33].
For example in one study, there was a characteristic pattern of rise in cardiac troponin I over time. The
troponin level was normal during admission, but subsequently increased in 37.5% of patients especially in
those who died. In those patients, the troponin level significantly increased in the week preceding the death
coinciding with severe systemic disorders including multiple organ failure, severe electrolyte disturbances,
management of ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), severe metabolic acidosis
and coagulation dysfunction all of which can potentially lead to secondary myocardial injury due to
increased oxidative stress on the heart [37].
Preexisting cardiovascular disease and acute myocardial injury in
SARS-CoV-2
Studies have demonstrated that patients with underlying CVD and other comorbid conditions are
predisposed to myocardial injury during COVID-19; the prevalence of hypertension among patients with
cardiac injury has been reported to be as high as 45%-65%, and that of coronary artery disease (CAD) has
been reported to be approximately 20%-30% (Table 4) [22,24,25].

In addition to the above mechanisms, in patients with underlying CVD, the acute systemic inflammatory
responses seen in COVID-19 can exacerbate inflammatory activity within coronary atherosclerotic plaques,
thus making the plaques prone to rupture. Inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases
the procoagulant activity of the blood, thereby contributing to the formation of occlusive thrombi over
ruptured coronary plaques and predisposing patients to ischemic myocardial injury [38].
COVID-19 and myocarditis
There are several clinically diagnosed myocarditis cases in patients with COVID-19 with supporting imaging

In the study, among 84 patients with COVID 19, four (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2
myocarditis based on the most updated diagnostic criteria for viral myocarditis [42]. However, in a single￾center retrospective study in 112 admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19, the authors explored whether
SARS-CoV-2 caused the myocarditis by performing at least one echocardiographic evaluation in all patients
during hospitalization. A total of 14 patients (12.5%) presented with abnormalities suggestive of possible
myocarditis with an elevation of troponin. The myocarditis diagnosis was based on findings of triple
elevation in cardiac troponin I (>0.12 ng/mL) plus abnormalities in echocardiography and/or ECG. The
abnormalities in echocardiography were defined as a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (<50%)
2020 B K et al. Cureus 12(6): e8426. DOI 10.7759/cureus.8426 6 of 10

or segmental wall motion abnormality or left ventricular wall thickening (>10 mm) and/or presence of
pericardial effusion (≥5 mm); the abnormalities in ECG were defined as ST-segment elevation/ST-T changes.
The echocardiography did not show typical signs of myocarditis, as stated above, except for the presence of
small pericardial effusion in some patients and nonspecific ECG manifestations, most commonly
tachycardia, which was not typical for myocardial injury but was more suggestive of systemic causes. Hence,
the authors suggested that myocardial injury may be more likely to be a result of systemic consequences
rather than direct damage by SARS-CoV-2 [37].
Uncertainties exist whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly cause cardiomyocyte infection as no biopsy- or
autopsy-demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 localization within cardiomyocytes has been reported to date. In a study
of COVID-19 through post-mortem needle core biopsy of the lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died
of COVID-19 pneumonia, cardiac biopsy performed in two patients in whom cardiac troponin was elevated
during hospital course showed only mild focal fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, which were
probably associated with the underlying conditions, such as hypertension-associated myocardial
hypertrophy and past ischemic injury; however, there was no evidence of inflammatory cellular infiltration
to indicate myocarditis [43].
Tavazzi et al. have described the first case in which a biopsy demonstrated myocardial localization of viral
particles suggestive of SARS-CoV-2, in a patient presenting with cardiogenic shock [41]. The clinical
presentation was suggestive of fulminant myocarditis; however, the pathologic study demonstrated low￾grade myocardial inflammation without evidence of myocardial necrosis. Given that the viral particles were
observed in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings, but not in cardiac myocytes, the
authors could not infer viral cardiotropism and suggested that either a viremic phase or migration of
infected macrophages from the lung is likely to occur in patients with COVID‐19 with non‐ischemic acute
myocardial injury [41]. Further investigations along with the histological demonstration of myocarditis
(inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrates plus myocyte necrosis not typical of ischemia [44]) and
identification of the viral genome in cardiac tissue will be required in the future to clarify the direct
association of COVID-19 with myocarditis.
Patterns of myocardial injury in COVID-19
Myocardial injury has been shown to present in three different patterns:
1. The most common pattern is mild troponin elevation (typically < 99th percentile of the upper reference
limit), with a modest rise or fall on subsequent days, as frequently observed in patients without cardiac
symptoms and those who survive after hospitalization [21,37].
2. The second pattern is progressive, in which some patients have normal troponin levels or moderate
troponin elevation during admission. However, the level progressively increases as the patients experience
clinical deterioration with respiratory failure along with an increase in other biomarkers (e.g., interleukin-6,
ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase) and usually occurs during the second week of hospitalization. This
pattern is observed among non-survivors, and death occurs around a median of 18.5 days after symptom
onset. One study has demonstrated that at four days after symptom onset, the median high sensitivity
cardiac TnI (hs-cTnI) levels were 8.8 pg/mL in non-survivors vs. 2.5 pg/mL in survivors. During follow-up,
the median hs-cTnI among survivors did not change significantly (2.5-4.4 pg/mL), whereas it rose to 24.7
pg/mL on day 7, to 55.7 pg/mL on day 13, to 134.5 pg/mL on day 19 and to 290.6 pg/mL on day 22 in non￾survivors [21,32,37].
3. The third pattern is early moderate troponin elevation (which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile
upper reference limit) and, subsequently, fall over the course of illness; this pattern is usually seen in
patients with clinically suspected myocarditis presenting predominantly with cardiac symptoms [36,39,40].
Clinical features of patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury
Studies have shown that patients with cardiac injury are more likely to be older (median age 65-74 years)
than those without cardiac injury [22,24,25], and most patients present with typical symptoms of COVID-19
like fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. In a study of 291 COVID-19 patients, 15 of whom had evidence of
cardiac injury, no patients complained of chest pain or palpitations. The common symptoms at illness onset
in both groups of patients with or without cardiac injury were similar and included fever, cough, headache,
fatigue, and dyspnea [22]. However, a minority of patients with cardiac injury might present with cardiac
symptoms with or without respiratory symptoms. In another study, 11 of 82 (13.4%) patients with
myocardial injury presented with chest pain, compared with 3 of 334 (0.9%) patients without cardiac injury
(P<0.001) [24]. In a case report of myocarditis, the initial presenting symptom was chest pain and respiratory
involvement, but an atypical presentation without respiratory symptoms was also described [36,37]. In terms
of radiologic findings, bilateral and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity are more prevalent in
patients with than without cardiac injury [25]. Limited studies in which patients with cardiac injury
underwent ECG have revealed ECG abnormalities such as T-wave depression and inversion, ST-segment
depression, and Q waves [24]. Patients with clinically suspected myocarditis have been found to have ST￾segment elevations [39,40].
Complications
Patients with cardiac injury and elevated troponin are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit
and to develop complications including ARDS, malignant arrhythmias including ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, acute coagulopathy, electrolyte disturbances, and acute kidney injury,
and to receive mechanical ventilation, CRRT, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and vasopressor
therapy, thus further suggesting that cardiac injury might be associated with the clinical outcomes of
COVID-19. The use of antibiotic treatment, glucocorticoids, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is
also significantly higher in patients with cardiac injury than without cardiac injury [24,25].
Myocardial injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19
Studies have shown that cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality in patients with COVID 19 (Tables
2,3). In a case series study in 416 patients with COVID-19, the Cox regression model, after adjustment for
2020 B K et al. Cureus 12(6): e8426. DOI 10.7759/cureus.8426 7 of 10

age, preexisting cardiovascular diseases, and other comorbid conditions and complications including ARDS,
revealed a significantly higher risk of death in patients with than without cardiac injury, either during the
time from symptom onset (hazard ratio [HR], 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) or time from admission to study
endpoint (HR, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]) [24]. Similarly, In another case series, even though patients with
COVID-19 with cardiac injury and underlying CVD had the highest mortality (69.44%), patients with
underlying CVD but normal TnT levels during the disease course had more favorable prognoses than patients
with elevated TnT levels but no underlying CVD (mortality, 13.3% vs. 37.5%), thus indicating relatively
favorable prognosis in patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury [25]. These studies
demonstrate that cardiac injury might be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in
patients with COVID-19.
Moreover, the mortality rate directly increases with the magnitude of the reference value of cardiac
troponin. In a single-center, retrospective cohort study including 188 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan,
China, conducted to explore whether heart injury occurred during COVID-19 on admission and later
increased mortality, approximately 11.2% of patients had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI)
exceeding the clinical upper normal limit on admission. Patients with high levels of hs-TnI on admission
had significantly higher mortality (50.0%) than patients with moderate or low levels of hs-TnI (10.0% or
9.1%). Besides, hs-TnI level on admission was significantly negatively correlated with the number of survival
days (r=-0.42, p=0.005) [35]. A study by Guo et al. showed that TnT and NT-proBNP levels increased
significantly during hospitalization in patients who ultimately died, whereas these dynamic changes in TnT
or NT-proBNP levels were not evident in survivors [25]. Based on a few studies, initial measurement of
cardiac biomarkers immediately after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection and longitudinal monitoring
during the hospital stay may aid in identifying a subset of patients who might progress to a poorer clinical
condition. However, further evidence from more studies is required.
Management considerations for acute myocardial injury in patients
with COVID-19
A myocardial injury should be suspected in patients with COVID-19 with troponin elevation or new
abnormalities in ECG and could be related to type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction, myocarditis, stress￾induced cardiomyopathy or cytokine induced-myocardial injury [45,46]. The approach to evaluating
myocardial injury in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should be based on balancing the benefits
of further evaluation in changing the management strategy versus the potential risk of nosocomial spread of
COVID-19 infection [45,46].
As such, elevated troponin levels should not be considered as evidence of acute myocardial infarction, which
is diagnosed based on symptoms and signs of ischemia and ECG changes [9]. In a multicenter case series
study form six hospitals in New York inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 who had ST-segment elevation on
ECG with the elevation of cardiac enzymes, 10 out of 18 patients were classified as having noncoronary
myocardial injury with no evidence of obstructive disease on coronary angiography and normal wall motion
on echocardiography. Eight patients received a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The median peak
troponin level was higher in patients with myocardial infarction than in those with a clinical diagnosis of
noncoronary myocardial injury [47].
If the clinical presentation is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), timely evaluation is required
to determine the need for urgent intervention. In patients with COVID-19 who have mild to moderate
troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute heart failure, clinical monitoring may be performed
without routine cardiac imaging until the recovery from the acute viral syndrome [46]. For patients with
clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure, echocardiography may be performed if the management
strategy and prognosis would be likely to change with the diagnosis. The possible diagnosis in the patients
with ventricular wall motion abnormalities, elevated troponin, and no ACS include clinically suspected
myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy [45]. As there is no established therapy for clinically suspected
myocarditis, routine evaluation with cardiovascular magnetic resonance or endomyocardial biopsy in those
cases is not recommended [45]. As such, regardless of fulminant or non-fulminant presentation, American
college of cardiology recommends against routine endomyocardial biopsy in patients with active COVID-19
with abnormal cardiac enzymes as biopsy is unlikely to change immediate clinical management whether the
etiology is due to myocarditis, cytokine-induced myocardial injury or type- 2 myocardial infarction [45,46].
Unfortunately, beyond guidelines for treating patients with ischemic myocardial injury, no consensus exists
regarding the routine management of patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury. The management of
myocardial injury focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause and supportive care (including
management of heart failure, therapy of arrhythmias, and avoidance of cardiotoxins) [45,46]. If the patient
clinically deteriorates or develop hemodynamic instability, or has severely elevated or rapidly rising
troponin, detailed evaluation, cardiology consultation and enrollment in clinical trials or experimental
therapies like antiviral agents, anti-cytokines (IL-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab), the convalescent plasma
may be considered on the case-by-case basis [46]. Although the use of steroids has not been recommended
in the general treatment of COVID-19, some reports have described patients recovering from fulminant
myocarditis with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. However, more studies will be needed to
determine which patient would benefit from such therapies [8]. For patients with refractory shock or
ventricular arrhythmias secondary to fulminant myocarditis, early institution of mechanical support with
ECMO can be considered as case reports with the successful rescue of such patients have been described [46].
In general, as the presence of CVD and myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients has been associated with
more severe outcomes and increased mortality, triaging patients with COVID-19 according to the presence
of underlying CVD and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment strategies may be reasonable
[25].
Finally, several therapies with potential cardiovascular side effects are currently being studied, and caution
must be used when administering these therapies to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. For
example, preliminary clinical research has suggested the potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine alone and
in combination with azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, but this is associated with QTc prolongation
and risk of fatal arrhythmias, thus warranting regular monitoring of QTc [48]. Controversy remains
concerning the use of ACEI/ARB for COVID-19. Some preclinical studies have suggested that RAAS
inhibitors may increase ACE2 (functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2) expression, raising concerns regarding
safety in patients with COVID-19; however, the data remain anecdotal, and no clinical studies have
2020 B K et al. Cureus 12(6): e8426. DOI 10.7759/cureus.8426 8 of 10

evaluated the effects of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19. As such, several leading professional societies
recommend continuation of RAAS inhibitors for patients who are at risk for, being evaluated for or currently
have COVID-19, and are taking these medications to treat other conditions for which these agents are
known to be beneficial, such as heart failure, or ischemic heart disease [49].
Future directions
Most studies have been conducted on Chinese cohorts, and thus the generalizability of the results to other
countries, including the United States, remains to be determined. Most studies have been single-centered
retrospective studies with the enrollment of small numbers of patients. Larger cohorts, multicenter and
prospective studies should be planned. They should include assessment of detailed heart function related
data, particularly ECG, echocardiography and possibly cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to
determine myocardial function, and the etiology and mechanism of cardiac injury. Most studies have not
discussed why troponin was measured in the first place, and no data are available to support a different
management strategy for patients with elevated troponin. Studies must be planned to define whether
adjunctive cardioprotective therapies, such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antivirals agents,
interferons and/or immunomodulatory therapy (immunoglobulins), may be advisable for patients with
significant elevation of cardiac injury biomarkers. Pathological examination of myocardial tissue of patients
with COVID-19 with definite myocardial injury will be needed to provide pathological evidence of the
etiology of myocardial injury and establish COVID-19 as a new etiological agent for myocarditis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, COVID-19 has been associated with an increased prevalence of acute cardiac injury, even
more so in patients with severe disease. The presence of preexisting cardiovascular disease increases the risk
of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19. Although the exact mechanism underlying the association of
cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear, direct virus-induced cardiomyocyte injury
leading to viral myocarditis, systemic cytokine-mediated myocardial injury and hypoxia-induced myocardial
oxidative stress have been suggested. The presence of myocardial injury is independently associated with
mortality and may be a predictor of progression to severe disease and adverse clinical outcomes in patients
with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to elucidate the predominant etiology of myocardial injury in
patients with COVID-19 and to promote targeted treatment programs to improve patient prognosis.
