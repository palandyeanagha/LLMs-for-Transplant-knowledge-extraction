Abstract
Introduction: Liver failure patients might be at risk for citrate accumulation during continuous venovenous
hemodialysis (CVVHD) with regional citrate anticoagulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive
capability of baseline liver function parameters regarding citrate accumulation, expressed as an increase in the calcium
total/calcium ionized (Catot/Caion) ratio ≥2.5, and to describe the feasibility of citrate CVVHD in liver failure patients.
Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in medical ICU patients treated in a German university
hospital. We performed 43 CVVHD runs using citrate for regional anticoagulation in 28 critically ill patients with
decompensated liver cirrhosis or acute liver failure (maximum of two CVVHD runs per patient). Liver function was
characterized before CVVHD using laboratory parameters, calculation of Child-Pugh and Model of End-stage Liver
Disease scores, and determination of the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green. In addition to blood gas
analysis, we measured total calcium and citrate in serum at baseline and after definitive time points for each CVVHD run.
Results: Accumulation of citrate in serum correlated with an increase in the Catot/Caion ratio. Although the critical
upper threshold of Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 was exceeded 10 times in seven different CVVHD runs, equalization of
initial metabolic acidosis was possible without major disturbances of acid-base and electrolyte status. Standard
laboratory liver function parameters showed poor predictive capabilities regarding citrate accumulation in terms of
an elevated Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5. In contrast, serum lactate ≥3.4 mmol/l and prothrombin time ≤26% predicted an
increase in the Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 with high sensitivity (86% for both lactate and prothrombin time) and
specificity (86% for lactate, 92% for prothrombin time).
Conclusions: Despite substantial accumulation of citrate in serum, CVVHD with regional citrate anticoagulation
seems feasible in patients with severely impaired liver function. Citrate accumulation in serum is reflected by an
increase in the Catot/Caion ratio. To identify patients at risk for citrate accumulation in terms of a Catot/Caion ratio
≥2.5, baseline serum lactate (threshold ≥3.4 mmol/l) and prothrombin time (threshold ≤26%) may be useful for risk
prediction in daily clinical practice. Careful monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base status is mandatory to ensure
patient safety.
Introduction
Regional anticoagulation with citrate in continuous veno￾venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) reduces the frequency of
bleeding complications, provides longer filter lifetime
[1-3], and may reduce mortality in ICU patients [4].
Reduced risk of bleeding complications and extracorpor￾eal clotting using citrate CVVHD might be particularly
beneficial in patients with impaired coagulation due to
liver failure [5]. Despite removal of up to 50% of the
citrate by the dialyzer as a complex bound with ionized
calcium (Caion), a certain amount of citrate enters the
systemic circulation. Citrate is predominantly metabo￾lized in the hepatic citric acid cycle and clearance is
almost independent of renal function and urinary

excretion [6,7]. Metabolism of citrate leads to the release
of Caion into the systemic circulation. Citrate also contri￾butes to the supply of alkaline plasma buffer bases,
because 3 g bicarbonate are produced out of 1 g citrate
[8,9]. In liver failure, citrate metabolism is impaired with
the risk of citrate accumulation [10]. This impairment
can result in a drop of Caion due to complex binding
between citrate and Caion requiring more calcium chlor￾ide substitution at the venous line of the extracorporeal
circuit. Finally, this binding leads to an increase in the
concentration of total calcium (Catot), defined as the sum
of Caion, protein, and citrate-bound calcium. In conse￾quence, an increase in the Catot/Caion ratio might be
observed. A serum Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 is assumed to be
a critical threshold for the prediction of citrate accumula￾tion [11]. In addition, metabolic acidosis with an enlarged
anion gap due to reduced citric acid cycle production of
bicarbonate out of citrate and accumulation of negative
loaded citrate ions might be observed as a complication
of CVVHD using citrate for regional anticoagulation [12].
Considering these potential side effects, patients with
overt hepatic impairment have been excluded in most of
the previous studies on citrate anticoagulation. Conse￾quently, data on the feasibility of citrate CVVHD in liver
failure patients are scarce. The aim of our study was
therefore to characterize predictors for citrate accumula￾tion in terms of a Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 and to investigate
the feasibility of citrate anticoagulation in patients with
markedly impaired liver function. Secondary endpoints
were the direct measurement of serum citrate levels and
their correlation to Catot, Caion, the Catot/Caion ratio, pH,
and anion gap as well as the evaluation of the time course
of electrolytes and acid-base status during CVVHD treat￾ment. Additionally, we analyzed the filter lifetime.
Materials and methods
Patients
Twenty-eight ICU patients aged 18 to 75 years suffering
from decompensated liver cirrhosis (25 patients) or acute
liver failure (three patients) who required renal replace￾ment therapy due to secondary acute renal failure were
included in the study. Forty-three CVVHD runs with a
maximum of two runs per patient were performed in
these 28 patients. Patients were consecutively enrolled
between October 2009 and October 2011. The diagnosis
of liver cirrhosis was confirmed either by histology and/
or by ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic
resonance tomography and typical clinical criteria such
as ascites, hepatorenal syndrome or presence of esopha￾geal varices. Presence of acute liver failure was defined as
an abrupt loss of liver function without pre-existing liver
disease. The patient’s liver function was characterized at
baseline immediately before the beginning of each
CVVHD treatment by calculating the Model of End-stage
Liver Disease score [13], the Child-Pugh score [14] in
case of cirrhosis, and by determining laboratory liver
function parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase, bilirubin, cholinesterase, prothrombin
time). Additionally, we determined the plasma disappear￾ance rate of indocyanine green [15]. The Simplified
Acute Physiology Score II [16] and the Therapeutic Inter￾vention Scoring System score [17] were determined in
order to characterize the severity of the underlying dis￾ease. Exclusion criteria comprised severe alkalosis (pH
>7.55) or acidosis (pH <7.1) and deficiency of ionized cal￾cium (Caion <0.9 mmol/l). Two patients had to be
excluded because of severe hypocalcemia, and two other
patients because of severe acidosis.
This prospective observational study was approved by
the institutional review board of the Technical University
of Munich, Germany. Written informed consent was
obtained from the patients or their legal representatives.
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis treatment
Commercially available hemodialysis devices were used
for CVVHD treatment: the HF 440 (Duomedica GmBH,
Maintal, Germany) for eight runs, or the Multifiltrate
(Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) for
35 runs. For all CVVHD treatments, a blood flow of
100 ml/minute and a dialysate flow of 2,000 ml/hour
were applied.
Custom-made 4% sodium citrate (136 mmol/l; 39.8 g/l
sodium citrate in 1,000 ml aqua destillata; Fresenius Medi￾cal Care) and calcium-free dialysate solution (sodium
133.0 mmol/l, potassium 2.0 mmol/l, calcium 0 mmol/l,
magnesium 0.75 mmol/l, chloride 116.5 mmol/l, bicarbo￾nate 20 mmol/l, glucose 1 g/l) were used. Calcium chlor￾ide solution was produced in the local hospital pharmacy
(500 mmol/l; 73.5 g calcium chloride dihydrate in 1,000
ml aqua destillata). Sodium citrate and calcium chloride
flow was started with 4 mmol/l and 1.7 mmol/l treated
blood, respectively, and adapted according to the required
limits of calcium between 0.25 and 0.35 mmol/l post filter
and 1.12 and 1.20 mmol/l in the patient’s circulation.
According to the study protocol, citrate and total calcium
in serum were measured at baseline just before the begin￾ning of CVVHD treatment, after 30 minutes, as well as
after 1, 4, 12, 24, and 72 hours. Blood gas analyses of the
patient’s circulation and Caion post filter were measured at
baseline, after 30 minutes, as well as after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16,
20, and 24 hours and then every 8 hours up to 72 hours of
the expected CVVHD treatment time.
Citrate levels were measured enzymatically by the
citrate-lyase method [18] (MVZ Labor Limbach, Heidel￾berg, Germany). Applying this method, citrate is meta￾bolized to oxalacetate and acetate catalyzed by the
enzyme citrate lyase. Oxalacetate is reduced to malate
and lactate by the enzymes L-malate-dehydrogenase and

L-lactate-dehydrogenase in a nicotinamide adenine
nucleotide hydrogen-dependent manner. Nicotinamide
adenine nucleotide hydrogen is the measured variable
and is equivalent to the amount of citrate.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are described by the median, minimum,
maximum and interquartile range (IQR), presented as the
first to third quartiles, since most data are heavily
skewed. For qualitative data, absolute and relative fre￾quencies are shown. To assess the ability of baseline
parameters to predict the critical event (Catot/Caion ratio
≥2.5 during CVVHD treatment) receiver operating char￾acteristic (ROC) analyses were performed for relevant
measures. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was
estimated using the trapezoidal rule and is presented as a
measure for predictive ability. For relevant baseline para￾meters, a 95% confidence interval for the AUC was esti￾mated using 10,000 bootstrap samples. A cutoff value for
best discrimination between patients of high and low risk
for development of citrate accumulation was assessed
using the Youden Index, so from all observed values the
one giving the biggest sum of sensitivity and specificity is
described as the best cutoff value. For relevant baseline
measures, sensitivities and specificities observed in the
data for the determined cutoff values are shown. Spear￾man’s rank correlation coefficient is presented to quantify
the association between the Catot/Caion ratio and citrate
(serum). For all analyses, repeated CVVHD runs in the
same patient were assumed to be statistically indepen￾dent. All analyses were performed using the software
packages SPSS version 19 (2010, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) and R version 2.13.1 (2011; R Foundation for Sta￾tistical Computing, Auckland, New Zealand).
Results
Patient characteristics
The mean age of the 28 study patients was 57 ± 11 years.
Eight patients were female. At baseline, 25 patients
received catecholamine therapy and 24 patients were on
mechanical ventilation. Three patients suffered from
acute liver failure (two patients with histological proven
acute alcoholic steatohepatitis, one patient with large
intrahepatic hematoma). Twenty-five patients had liver
cirrhosis due to alcoholism (20 patients), chronic hepati￾tis (one patient), alcoholism combined with chronic
hepatitis (two patients), primary sclerosing cholangitis
(one patient), or a cryptogenic cause (one patient).
Patients were admitted to the ICU because of acute liver
failure (three patients), hepatorenal syndrome (six
patients), acute bleeding (five patients), hepatic encepha￾lopathy (three patients), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
(six patients) and other infections (pneumonia in three
patients, meningitis in one patient, endocarditis in one
patient).
Table 1 demonstrates the baseline patient characteris￾tics and parameters of liver function immediately before
the beginning of each CVVHD treatment. Severity of
hepatic dysfunction in the patients evaluated in the study
is reflected by a median Model of End-stage Liver Disease
score of 36 points (IQR 28 to 40), a median plasma disap￾pearance rate for indocyanine green of 3.6% (IQR 3.2 to
5.1), and a median bilirubin level of 12 mg/dl (IQR 2.6 to
22.5).
Acute kidney injury
For the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI), the Acute
Kidney Injury Network classification was used [19].
According to this classification, two patients suffered
from AKI stage I, four patients from AKI stage II and 22
patients from AKI stage III at ICU admission. Normal
renal function was not present in any of the 28 study
patients at the time of ICU admission. Reasons for AKI
were infection/sepsis (12 patients), hepatorenal syndrome
(10 patients) and bleeding shock (six patients). Con￾founding factors for the appearance of AKI might be the
application of contrast medium (12 out of the 28 patients
had a computed tomography scan with contrast medium
in the last 4 weeks before the first CVVHD treatment),
the transfusion intensity in the ICU (Table 2), the fre￾quency of mechanical ventilation (when CVVHD was
started: 14 cases with pressure-controlled ventilation, 25
cases with pressure-supported ventilation, four cases with
spontaneous breathing) and the presence of catechola￾mine therapy (Table 2). The median length of ICU stay
was 27 days (minimum 7 days, IQR 19 to 37 days, maxi￾mum 90 days). Twenty-four patients died in the ICU.
Among the four survivors, kidney function recovered in
three patients and one patient needed further hemodialy￾sis treatment.
Filter lifetime
The aspired treatment time of 72 hours was achieved in
32 out of 43 (74%) CVVHD running courses. No
CVVHD treatment was interrupted within the first 24
hours. CVVHD runs had to be stopped prematurely
because of filter clotting (two cases), a Catot/Caion ratio
≥2.5 (three cases), intervention/surgery (three cases),
and planned stop (two cases). In one case, the reason
for interruption was not documented. Two cases of pre￾mature stop due to a Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 coincided
with filter clotting and surgery, respectively. Interruption
of CVVHD because of an isolated elevated Catot/Caion
ratio ≥2.5 without the opportunity to increase the cal￾cium substitution rate of 3 mmol/l treated blood is an
endpoint of clinical relevance. This endpoint was found

in only one case, resulting in a treatment stop ahead of
schedule.
Acid-base status and electrolyte balance during CVVHD
treatment
At baseline, pH was in the acidotic range with values
<7.35 in 77% (33/43) of CVVHD runs. During CVVHD
treatment, the pH distribution shifted from the acidotic
range towards equalized pH values. After 24 and 72
hours, the reference pH between 7.35 and 7.45 was
achieved in 33% (14/43) and 53% (17/32) of running
courses, respectively (Figure 1a). In accordance with
observed pH values, metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate
values <22 mmol/l was observed in 65% (28/43) of
CVVHD treatments at baseline. After 24 hours, balanced
bicarbonate levels between 22 and 26 mmol/l could be
achieved in 60% (26/43) of CVVHD runs. However, after
72 hours of CVVHD treatment, there was a shift towards
metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate >26 mmol/l) in the
majority (53%, 17/32) of running courses. Metabolic
acidosis with bicarbonate values <22 mmol/l was obvious
in only 19% (6/32) of CVVHD runs after 72 hours (Figure
1b). In these CVVHD runs with acidotic bicarbonate
values <22 mmol/l after 72 hours (n = 6), we observed a
median Catot/Caion ratio of 2.43 and median citrate con￾centration of 235 mg/l (1.22 mmol/l). When bicarbonate
levels >22 mmol/l were observed after 72 hours of
CVVHD treatment (n = 26), we obtained a lower median

To characterize baseline liver function, the Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (ICG-PDR)
were calculated in each patient, and the Child-Pugh score only in patients with cirrhosis. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and the Therapeutic
Intervention Scoring System (TISS) score as well as the laboratory parameters were determined immediately before the start of each continuous venovenous
hemodialysis treatment. ALAT, alanine aminotransferase; ASAT, aspartate aminotransferase.

Catot/Caion ratio of 2.15 and a lower median citrate con￾centration of 151 mg/l (0.79 mmol/l).
pCO2 might also influence pH, and the bicarbonate
level but remained stable during CVVHD treatment with
a trend towards hypercapnia (Figure 1e). At baseline we
observed pCO2 values >45 mmHg in 63% of CVVHD
runs (after 24 hours in 61%, after 72 hours in 56%). At
baseline, base excess (BE) was in the acidotic range (<–2
mmol/l) in 79% (34/43) of CVVHD treatments. During
CVVHD treatment, BE normalized towards values
between -2 and 3 mmol/l -2 and 3 mmol/l in 51% (22/
43) of CVVHD runs after 24 hours and in 44% (14/32) of
CVVHD runs after 72 hours. In 28% of CVVHD treat￾ments (9/32), BE was in the alkaline range with values ≥3
mmol/l after 72 hours (Figure 1c). The anion gap was
within the reference range in 74% (31/42) of CVVHD
runs at baseline, in 63% (27/43) after 24 hours and in
56% (18/32) of CVVHDs after 72 hours. In accordance
with the increase of bicarbonate, there was a trend
towards a decrease in the anion gap with values <10
mmol/l in 41% (14/32) of treatments after 72 hours com￾pared with 21% (9/42) at baseline (Figure 1d). The anion
gap increased in only 3% (1/32) of citrate CVVHD treat￾ments after 72 hours.
Regarding serum electrolytes, there was a slight trend
towards hypocalcemia with Caion values <1.13 mmol/l in
41% (13/32) of CVVHD runs after 72 hours treatment
time compared with 21% (9/43) at baseline. However, only
mild deficiency of ionized calcium was observed with a
minimum Caion of 1 mmol/l after 72 hours (Table 2). The
desired reference range of Caion was achieved in 74%
(32/43) at baseline, in 84% (36/43) after 24 hours, and in
59% (19/32) after 72 hours (Figure 1f). The sodium bal￾ance was stable during CVVHD treatment, with sodium
values being within the reference range of 135 to 148
mmol/l in 91% of runs after 72 hours (Figure 1g). We
observed mild hyperchloremia during CVVHD treatment
(Figure 1h). Table 3 additionally demonstrates the time
course of pH, bicarbonate, BE, anion gap, pCO2, Caion,
sodium and chloride during CVVHD, including minimum
and maximum values at baseline, after 24 hours and after
72 hours.
Prediction of citrate accumulation in terms of Catot/Caion
ratio ≥2.5 by baseline liver function parameters
The predictive capabilities of liver function parameters at
baseline regarding a Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 were investi￾gated using ROC analysis. For 10 out of 273 measure￾ments determined during seven out of 43 CVVHD runs
the Catot/Caion ratio exceeded the critical threshold of
≥2.5, suggesting citrate accumulation during CVVHD
treatment after 12 hours (three runs), 24 hours (six runs)
and 72 hours (one run). The highest AUC values regard￾ing citrate accumulation were observed for serum lactate
(AUC = 0.92; confidence interval = 0.81 to 0.99) and for
prothrombin time (AUC = 0.90; confidence interval =
0.70 to >0.99) (Figure 2a,b). An increase in Catot/Caion
ratio ≥2.5 was predicted by a serum lactate level ≥3.4
mmol/l (sensitivity 86%, specificity 86%) and a prothrom￾bin time ≤26% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 92%). The
ROC AUC for the prediction of a Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5
was 0.71 for aspartate aminotransferase, 0.49 for alanine
aminotransferase, 0.67 for bilirubin, 0.73 for cholinester￾ase, 0.69 for the Child-Pugh score, 0.84 for the Model of
End-stage Liver Disease score, and 0.54 for the plasma
disappearance rate for indocyanine green.
Citrate accumulation in serum
Direct measurement of citrate demonstrated up to 29-
fold elevated serum citrate levels after 72 hours (median
160 mg/l (0.83 mmol/l), IQR 113 to 215 mg/l (0.59 to
1.12 mmol/l), maximum 318 mg/l (1.66 mmol/l)) com￾pared with baseline citrate values (minimum 11 mg/l
(0.06 mmol/l), median 28 mg/l (0.15 mmol/l), IQR 23 to
37 mg/l (0.12 to 0.19 mmol/l)). Citrate levels best corre￾lated with the Catot/Caion ratio (Figure 3) but were not
associated with Catot, Caion, pH and the anion gap over
the CVVHD running time. This observation emphasizes
that increases in Catot/Caion ratio appropriately reflect
citrate accumulation over the CVVHD treatment time.
Discussion
Despite previous studies demonstrating the feasibility of
citrate anticoagulation in CVVHD, its use was usually
restricted to patients without severe hepatic impairment.
In case of severe liver failure, citrate can accumulate due
to impaired citrate metabolism in the citric acid cycle in
the liver [10,20-22]. Development of metabolic acidosis
and an increased anion gap might therefore be expected.
In contrast, in our study a trend to metabolic alkalosis
was obvious with bicarbonate values >26 mmol/l in 53%
of CVVHD runs after 72 hours versus 7% at baseline. In
parallel, BE increases over time - with 72% of running
courses achieving the nonacidotic range (>- -2 mmol/l)
compared with 79% of courses being in the acidotic
range (<–2 mmol/l) at baseline. Fitting to the increased
bicarbonate and BE levels, the anion gap diminishes over
treatment time. Metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate <22
mmol/l) was seen in 19% of running courses after 72
hours compared with 65% at baseline. Despite the
encouraging equalization of the initial acidosis, citrate
accumulation might in part be responsible for the meta￾bolic acidosis after 72 hours because elevated citrate
levels and an increased Catot/Caion ratio were observed in
these runs.
Altogether, in our study we observed a prevailed shift
from plasma acidification towards plasma alkalization
over the CVVHD treatment time. This is probably not

due to a premature ending of CVVHD running courses
because of a Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5, as only three out of
the seven CVVHD runs with an elevated ratio ≥2.5 were
stopped prematurely after 24 hours. All other courses with
an elevated Catot/Caion ratio ≥2.5 achieved the expected
treatment time of 72 hours. A study by Kramer and collea￾gues showed a reduced citrate clearance following infusion
of sodium citrate and calcium chloride over 2 hours in
patients with liver cirrhosis (340 ml/minute) in compari￾son with noncirrhotic patients (710 ml/minute) [23].
Despite this proven impaired citrate clearance in liver fail￾ure patients, also in this study by Kramer and colleagues
was a trend towards the development of metabolic alkalo￾sis seen in the cirrhotic and the noncirrhotic patient
groups without significant difference. Furthermore, citrate
accumulation comprises the risk of hypocalcemia due
to complex binding with Caion. In our study no severe
decrease in ionized calcium was observed. This was prob￾ably prevented by regularly monitoring Caion in the
patient’s circulation during the first few hours of CVVHD
treatment in which the calcium chloride substitution at
the arterial line of the extracorporeal circuit consistently
needed to be elevated.
In our study, a 29-fold increase of citrate in serum was
measured. This result is difficult to interpret because, to
the best of our knowledge, an upper normal or even
toxic level of citrate in serum is not well established.
Being a physiological metabolite, citrate is probably not
toxic itself but might induce metabolic disorders (espe￾cially hypocalcemia) due to complex binding between
citrate and Caion. During continuous hemofiltration, a
correlation between citrate in serum and the Catot/Caion
ratio in critically ill patients without liver failure has pre￾viously been described by Hetzel and colleagues [24]. In
our study, we demonstrate this relationship between
serum citrate levels and the Catot/Caion ratio in liver fail￾ure patients. The Catot/Caion ratio with a critical thresh￾old ≥2.5 might therefore be a more helpful parameter to
identify patients at risk for metabolic disturbances (for
example, drop of ionized calcium), than the citrate level
per se with a missing cutoff value indicating intoxication
during citrate accumulation. Furthermore, citrate accu￾mulation can be prevented by the application of CVVHD
instead of continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
CVVHD can be performed using lower blood flow while
removing more citrate bound to ionized calcium over the
hemodialysis filter.
One of the aims of this study was to evaluate predic￾tive capabilities of baseline liver function parameters
regarding citrate accumulation expressed as a Catot/
Caion ratio ≥2.5. We identified a prothrombin time
≤26% and a serum lactate level ≥3.4 mmol/l to be useful
for predicting citrate accumulation. In certain patients,
closer monitoring using blood gas analysis including
Caion and the plasma bicarbonate concentration might
be mandatory to ensure patient safety. None of the
established liver function parameters such as transami￾nases or bilirubin level showed appropriate predictive
capabilities for citrate accumulation reflected by a Catot/
Caion ratio ≥2.5. In accordance, Kramer and colleagues
could not predict citrate clearance by standard liver
function tests [23]. As the citric acid cycle of the liver is
oxygen dependent, lactate seems to be a very valuable
predictive parameter at first sight. However, lactate eleva￾tion can be caused by hypovolemia and hypoxia due to
circulatory failure but also by liver failure itself. The vari￾ety of reasons for elevated lactate levels lowers its predic￾tive value and needs to be mentioned as a potential
limitation of the present study. In addition, interference
in the prothrombin time by substitutable coagulation fac￾tors is another limitation. Further limitations include the
circumscribed number of patients and the observational
character of this study.
Conclusions
Despite substantial accumulation of citrate in serum, we
observed no major disturbances in the acid-base status
during CVVHD treatment demonstrating the feasibility
of citrate anticoagulation in liver failure patients. Citrate
accumulation correlates with an increase in the Catot/
Caion ratio, with a threshold ≥2.5 being indicative for
citrate accumulation. Patients exceeding this threshold

might be at risk for a drop of ionized calcium and devel￾opment of metabolic acidosis during CVVHD.
Whereas established liver function parameters such as
transaminases and bilirubin showed poor predictive cap￾abilities regarding prediction of a Catot /Caion ratio ≥2.5
in liver failure patients, a serum lactate level ≥3.4 mmol/
l and a prothrombin time ≤26% where highly predictive
for this endpoint. Despite interference in the prothrom￾bin time by substitution of coagulation factors and the
different reasons for lactate elevation, such as liver fail￾ure itself, these two parameters might be helpful in daily
clinical practice to identify patients at risk for citrate
accumulation who require close monitoring of the acid￾base status and ionized calcium values during CVVHD
treatment.
Key messages
• Substantial accumulation of citrate in serum of liver
failure patients is observed during CVVHD treatment.
• Citrate in serum correlates with the Catot/Caion ratio
in liver failure patients.
• For daily clinical practice, the Catot/Caion ratio might
be more useful for the detection of citrate accumulation
compared with citrate, because clear cutoff values for
citrate in serum are missing.
• A prothrombin time ≤26% and serum lactate ≥3.4
mmol/l might be risk factors for citrate accumulation in
liver failure patients in whom closer monitoring of the
acid-base and electrolyte status is mandatory to ensure
patient safety.
• CVVHD using citrate for regional anticoagulation in
liver failure patients is feasible.
