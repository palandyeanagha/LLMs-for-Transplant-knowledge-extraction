Introduction
Patients with sickle hemoglobinopathies have variable pheno￾types, with different pain frequencies and severity and pleiotropic 
complications, including lung injury, stroke, cutaneous leg ulcer￾ation, kidney injury with proteinuria, osteonecrosis, and system￾ic and pulmonary hypertension (PH). These phenotypes result 
from erythrocyte injury caused by sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and its 
deoxygenation-induced polymerization. Erythrocyte injury leads 
to extra- and intravascular hemolysis, endothelial dysfunction 
and vasculopathy, and occlusion of small and large blood vessels, 
producing tissue ischemia/reperfusion injury and inflammation. 
Damage to circulating erythrocytes occurs with wide diversity 
amongst individuals (1). This heterogeneity arises from differenc￾es in intrinsic characteristics of sickle erythrocytes, like hetero￾cellular fetal hemoglobin (HbF) distribution, HbS concentration 
(2), hydration, and density (3, 4), and the cell’s environmental 
transitions from macro- to microcirculation, laminar to turbulent 
flow, normoxia to hypoxia, isotonic to hypertonic environment, 
and acidotic to alkalotic milieu. Multiple components contribute 
to sickle hemoglobinopathy pathophysiology, including prima￾ry components arising from HbS polymerization and secondary 
components that are downstream effects of the HbS polymer. 
Understanding how these components’ complexity is compound￾ed by genetic and environmental modulation provides insight into 
the well-known clinical heterogeneity of sickle cell disease (SCD).
A cardinal feature of SCD pathogenesis involves inflamma￾tion, accompanied by heterocellular leukocyte-platelet-erythro￾cyte-endothelial adhesive events that trigger vaso-occlusive epi￾sodes, acute organ ischemia, and reperfusion injury. Twenty-five 
years ago, epidemiological studies identified leukocytosis, lower 
HbF levels, and higher total hemoglobin levels as risk factors asso￾ciated with increasing incidence of acute painful episodes and 
acute chest syndrome (ACS) (5). The independent association 
of high total hemoglobin levels with more pain, ACS events, and 
osteonecrosis was never mechanistically explained; however, it 
was implied to be a result of increased blood viscosity (Table 1). 
Recent epidemiological studies found that lower hemoglobin lev￾els and higher intensity of steady-state hemolytic anemia consis￾tently associate with vasculopathic complications of disease, such 
as stroke, leg ulcers, PH, priapism, and renal failure. This sug￾gests that certain subphenotypes of SCD relate more to hemolytic 
anemia severity rather than sickle vaso-occlusion. The reader is 
referred to recent reviews describing the exceptional strides made 
in understanding the roles of red cell rigidity (6), inflammation, 
and cell adhesion in sickle vaso-occlusion (7–9). Here, we review 
the complementary role of intravascular hemolysis and anemia. 
Hemolysis is a fundamental feature of sickle cell anemia that contributes to its pathophysiology and phenotypic variability. 
Decompartmentalized hemoglobin, arginase 1, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and adenine nucleotides are all products of 
hemolysis that promote vasomotor dysfunction, proliferative vasculopathy, and a multitude of clinical complications of 
pulmonary and systemic vasculopathy, including pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, priapism, chronic kidney disease, and 
large-artery ischemic stroke. Nitric oxide (NO) is inactivated by cell-free hemoglobin in a dioxygenation reaction that also 
oxidizes hemoglobin to methemoglobin, a non–oxygen-binding form of hemoglobin that readily loses heme. Circulating 
hemoglobin and heme represent erythrocytic danger-associated molecular pattern (eDAMP) molecules, which activate 
the innate immune system and endothelium to an inflammatory, proadhesive state that promotes sickle vaso-occlusion 
and acute lung injury in murine models of sickle cell disease. Intravascular hemolysis can impair NO bioavailability and 
cause oxidative stress, altering redox balance and amplifying physiological processes that govern blood flow, hemostasis, 
inflammation, and angiogenesis. These pathological responses promote regional vasoconstriction and subsequent blood 
vessel remodeling. Thus, intravascular hemolysis represents an intrinsic mechanism for human vascular disease that 
manifests clinical complications in sickle cell disease and other chronic hereditary or acquired hemolytic anemias.

teinuria and renal insufficiency (24–26). In contrast, as mentioned 
earlier, other complications were associated with lower hemolysis 
rates and higher steady-state hemoglobin levels, including the rate 
of vaso-occlusive painful episodes, ACS, and osteonecrosis (Table 
1). Unlike hemolysis, traditional established risk factors for vaso-oc￾clusive episodes, such as steady-state leukocytosis (27, 28) and high 
hemoglobin levels (29), do not accurately predict the above-men￾tioned vasculopathic events and mortality observed as the patient 
population ages. To date, no alternative mechanism has been pro￾posed to explain the divergent associations between the severity of 
hemolytic anemia and specific clinical complications.
With a decade of new data to review, we now reappraise the 
relationship between intravascular hemolysis and the pathophysi￾ology of SCD and further extend the role of intravascular hemoly￾sis and NO scavenging to other diseases.
Evidence that hemolysis modulates SCD 
subphenotypes
SCD phenotypes are expressed in common and rare subpheno￾types. Some subphenotypes are attributed to sickle vaso-occlusive 
events triggered by adherent sickle erythrocytes and are closely 
related to packed cell volume, blood viscosity, and inflammation/
intracellular adhesion. Other events are a presumed consequence 
of intravascular hemolysis of injured sickle cells. Table 1 lists com￾mon subphenotypes of disease and their epidemiological associa￾tions with biomarkers of hemolytic anemia and inflammation/vis￾cosity/vaso-occlusion. HbF and α-thalassemia are the two principal 
modulators of the SCD phenotype. HbF has its most robust effects 
on subphenotypes associated with sickle vaso-occlusion, including 
ACS (30–32). Failure of HbF to afford similar levels of protection 
for hemolysis-associated subphenotypes might be a consequence 
of insufficient HbF in some cells, which allows continued intravas￾cular hemolysis and endothelial injury over long exposures (33, 34).
α-Thalassemia modulates the phenotype of SCD by reducing 
hemolysis (35). α-Thalassemia reduces mean cell hemoglobin 
Unless specified, in this Review “hemolysis” and “intravascular 
hemolysis” are used interchangeably.
The hemolysis hypothesis
Nine years have passed since we proposed that intravascular 
destruction of sickle erythrocytes is pathogenetically related to 
certain common complications of SCD, igniting a long-smoldering 
debate on the mechanistic basis of these associations (10–12). The 
crux of the hypothesis was a general appreciation that products of 
intravascular hemolysis damage the vascular system (13). More spe￾cifically, it proposed that nitric oxide (NO) depletion in the micro￾circulation resulted from intravascular hemolysis–driven release of 
cell-free hemoglobin into the plasma that reacted with NO via the 
well-known dioxygenation reaction to form inert nitrate. This reac￾tion occurs in vitro (14) and is promoted by blood substitutes in vivo 
(15), and its occurrence in SCD is supported by in vitro and in vivo 
evidence, summarized later in this Review (16). NO is a free radical 
produced enzymatically by a family of NO synthases (NOSs) during 
the conversion of arginine to citrulline. Endothelial NO, produced 
by endothelial NOS3, diffuses to adjacent smooth muscle, where 
it binds and activates the heme of soluble guanylate cyclase, which 
subsequently converts GTP to cGMP. This activation of cGMP￾dependent protein kinases produces vasodilation by causing calci￾um sequestration and perivascular smooth muscle relaxation. NO is 
also depleted during intravascular hemolysis when arginase is liber￾ated from erythrocytes, destroying arginine, the substrate for NOS 
(17), and by reactions of NO with ROS that are generated during 
intravascular hemolysis. Compounding the effects of these NO- and 
arginine-scavenging pathways, lysed red cells release asymmetric 
dimethylarginine, an endogenous inhibitor of NOS (18). A role for 
intravascular hemolysis in promoting endothelial dysfunction was 
bolstered by epidemiological cohort studies linking laboratory bio￾markers of the intensity of hemolytic anemia and risk of develop￾ing specific complications of SCD, including PH (19), cutaneous leg 
ulceration (20, 21), priapism (22), stroke (23), and, recently, pro￾Table 1. Subphenotypes of SCD and their association with hyperhemolysis, α-thalassemia, and HbF

Hyperhemolysis is inferred from a combination of increased serum concentration of indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase. α-Thalassemia was 
ascertained by gene analysis. For nearly every subphenotype it is possible to find some contradictory evidence because of differences in cohort age 
distributions, sample size, phenotype definitions, and analytical approaches. Because of space limitations, many studies are not included. For most 
subphenotypes, both children and adults are included. TCD, transcranial Doppler; TR, tricuspid regurgitant.

hyperhemolysis (19, 39, 44, 48–56). PH, either screened for with 
TRV or definitively ascertained by right heart catheterization, is 
closely associated with the intensity of hemolysis and mortality 
(discussed below). Some aspects of the hemolytic phenotype, like 
abnormally high TRV and PH confirmed by right heart catheter￾ization, are seen in other hemolytic anemias where intravascular 
hemolysis is common (and vaso-occlusive crisis is absent) like 
β-thalassemia (57). Similarly to SCD (58), these other hemolytic 
disorders also feature a hypercoagulable state with evidence of 
microthrombotic disease in the pulmonary vasculature (59).
Hemolytic anemia and vasculopathic 
complications
Numerous cohort studies evaluated and confirmed the association 
of hemolytic anemia severity with increasing pulmonary pressures 
estimated by TRV and directly measured by right heart catheteriza￾tion. Many of these studies also evaluated the relationship between 
estimated or directly measured pulmonary artery pressures and 
reduced exercise capacity and/or risk of death. These studies 
include the NIH-PH (19), Duke (60), UNC (49), MSH (39), CSSCD 
(54), PUSH (50, 61), and Walk-PHASST (51) cohorts, a Greek cohort 
(62), and a recent 656-SCD-patient echocardiographic screen￾ing study in Créteil, France (63). The analysis of more than 600 
screening patients in both the Walk-PHASST and Créteil cohorts 
found similar associations between indices of hemolytic anemia, 
high TRV, and risk of death (51, 63). These associations were large￾ly confirmed in right heart catheterization studies (64–66).
Severity of hemolytic anemia was associated not only with 
risk of precapillary PH, but also with risk of postcapillary PH. The 
latter was observed with echocardiographic markers of heart fail￾ure with preserved ejection fraction (67–70) and right heart cath￾eterization (64–66). The involvement of left ventricular disease 
complicates the diagnosis, clinical management, and prognosis in 
SCD, as discussed below.
While hemolytic anemia is an independent risk factor for vas￾culopathic complications, hemolysis does not occur in isolation. 
Priapism and leg ulcers occur more frequently in SCD patients 
than in patients with other hemolytic diseases like paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), spherocytosis, β-thalassemia, 
and pyruvate kinase deficiency, which surely represents the con￾tribution of unique characteristics of the sickle erythrocyte, sickle 
vaso-occlusion, and inflammatory damage to intravascular hemo￾lysis–provoked injury. This is particularly evident in the epidemi￾ology of priapism, in which indices of both hemolytic anemia and 
inflammation are associated with this clinical manifestation (71). 
A nexus between hemolysis and sickle vaso-occlusion might lay in 
the increased adhesivity of the sickle reticulocyte, sickle erythro￾cyte lysis in vaso-occluded regions (discussed below), and down￾stream inflammatory effects of intravascular hemolysis products, 
like heme, that drive sterile inflammation.
Elevated TRV and SCD complications
TRV can be quantified by Doppler echocardiography and used to 
estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. This value is a predic￾tive physiological biomarker and a widely used screening test for 
PH. While TRV has important limitations in sensitivity and specific￾ity, it is a continuous variable that is inversely proportional to exer￾concentration and erythrocyte density, thereby reducing the ten￾dency of deoxy-HbS to polymerize (35). In compound heterozy￾gotes for α-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (SCA, characterized 
by homozygosity for the HbS gene), hemoglobin levels are higher 
and the prevalence of subphenotypes associated with hemolytic 
anemia are reduced in comparison with SCA alone; in contrast to 
SCA, the prevalence of vaso-occlusive pain crisis and the preva￾lence of ACS are increased (36). Consistent with this observation, 
in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults with SCA, a Gar￾dos channel inhibitor significantly reduced hemolysis, increased 
hemoglobin levels, and increased the rate of vaso-occlusive pain￾ful episodes (37). Reduction of hemolysis by the Gardos channel 
inhibitor was associated with significant decline in serum N-ter￾minal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (38), potential￾ly consistent with decreased pulmonary artery pressure, but also 
possibly caused simply by improved anemia and lower cardiac 
preload (39). The results of this antihemolytic pharmacological 
intervention substantially phenocopy SCA–α-thalassemia, further 
supporting phenotypic modulation of SCD by hemolysis and ane￾mia. Other than increased blood viscosity, only increased adhe￾siveness is hypothesized to mediate the increased risk of vaso￾occlusion in SCA–α-thalassemia (40), but no published evidence 
supports this alternative hypothesis.
Many studies have confirmed the association of indirect mark￾ers of hemolysis with certain complications of disease. Hemolytic 
rate in SCD has been measured directly by labeled-erythrocyte 
survival studies (34, 41). More often, indirect surrogates of red cell 
lifespan, including plasma hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, eryth￾rocyte microparticles, serum bilirubin, reticulocyte count, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (AST), and urine 
hemosiderin or cell-free hemoglobin, have been used singly and 
in combination to estimate the hemolysis intensity (20, 25). Com￾posite indices characterizing hemolysis severity were validated by 
comparison with the plasma levels of cell-free hemoglobin and 
red blood cell microparticles. These measures correlate appropri￾ately with hemoglobin and reticulocyte counts and are decreased 
in patients with high HbF or with α-thalassemia (25). Based on 
plasma hemoglobin measurements, the fraction of intravascular 
hemolysis ranges from less than 10% to more than 30%, while 
total plasma hemoglobin concentrations (reported here in terms 
of heme concentration) range from 0.25 to more than 20 μM (16). 
As discussed later, these concentrations are sufficient to scavenge 
NO and perhaps trigger sickle vasculopathy.
Hyperhemolysis-associated SCD subphenotypes
A suggested paradigm proposes a gradient of hemolysis among 
SCD patients, with the highest quartile of this gradient sometimes 
referred to as hyperhemolysis (19–23, 25, 26, 41, 42–47). This gra￾dient results from the differential distribution of HbF concentra￾tions among sickle erythrocytes, the presence or absence of α-thal￾assemia mutations, and perhaps other genetic determinants that 
directly or indirectly affect erythrocyte lifespan (36). Included in 
the vasculopathic subphenotypes associated with hyperhemo￾lysis are PH, cerebrovascular disease, leg ulcers, priapism, and 
sickle nephropathy (20). Tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) and 
serum NT-proBNP are markers of pulmonary vascular disease 
and myocardial wall stress and are consistently associated with

Prevalence of elevated TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s was 21% in children and 
30% in adults. In random-effects meta-analyses, the 6-minute 
walk was 30.4 m less in patients with elevated TRV than in those 
without elevated TRV, and the associated mortality hazard ratio 
was 4.9. Mortality among high-TRV SCD patients seems to be lim￾ited to adults, suggesting the testable hypothesis that high TRV in 
childhood predicts future risk of mortality later in adulthood. Mor￾tality estimates are likely becoming more accurate as the number 
of screened adults and duration of follow-up increase.
PH and mortality in SCD
In general, right heart catheterization is required for a definitive 
diagnosis of PH, which is defined by a mean pulmonary artery 
pressure of at least 25 mmHg, although it is increasingly appreciat￾ed that mean pressures between 20 and 25 mmHg are not normal 
and might predict reduced exercise capacity and risk. Three SCD 
hemodynamic studies, from the US, Brazil, and France, evaluated 
the prevalence of PH defined by right heart catheterization in SCD 
and examined associated clinical risk factors and prospective risk 
of death. In the study with the longest follow-up times, performed 
at the NIH, 531 SCD patients were evaluated with a median fol￾low-up time of 4.7 years and a maximum of 11 years for surviving 
subjects (64, 76). In this cohort, 84 right heart catheterizations 
were performed. Fifty-five of 531 SCD subjects (10.4%), or 55 of 84 
(65.5%) of those who underwent catheterization, had PH; slightly 
more than half had pulmonary arterial hypertension (precapillary), 
and the other half had pulmonary venous hypertension. PH was 
associated with higher LDH levels and lower hemoglobin levels, 
higher prevalence of leg ulcers and renal insufficiency, and lower 
exercise capacity, defined by worse functional classification and 
lower 6-minute walk distance (64, 76).
Survival estimates for SCD patients with PH was 63% at 5 
years, compared with 83% for SCD patients with normal right 
heart catheterization. Death certificates were available for 65% 
of SCD patients who died, and 80% of these reported right heart 
failure or sudden cardiac death, a cause of death seen commonly 
in the general pulmonary arterial hypertension population (77). 
Multivariate analysis of hemodynamic variables identified pulmo￾nary vascular resistance, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmo￾nary artery systolic and diastolic pressures as predictors of mor￾tality. SCD patients with PH who died had worse hemodynamic 
values than survivors: mean pulmonary artery pressures of 39 ± 9 
versus 33 ± 7 mmHg (P < 0.001), transpulmonary gradient of 25 ± 
10 versus 17 ± 8 mmHg (P = 0.003), and pulmonary vascular resis￾tance of 279 ± 164 versus 189 ± 127 dyn•s/cm5
 (P = 0.017) strongly 
suggested that mortality rate in adults with SCD is proportional to 
severity of precapillary pulmonary vascular disease (64, 76).
In the Brazilian study, 80 SCD patients were screened, and 26 
with elevated estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures by 
Doppler echocardiography had right heart catheterizations (66). 
Ten percent of patients had PH, with worse survival compared 
with the remaining patients. Patients with PH had lower hemo￾globin and higher LDH levels, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, 
and lower 6-minute walk distance. The third study, in France, was 
also consistent with primary observations from the previously dis￾cussed trials (65). After exclusion of adults with greater disease 
severity, 6% of all screened adults had PH (46% precapillary and 
cise capacity measured by the 6-minute walk distance and directly 
related to rising risk of death in adults with SCD (19, 49, 51, 60, 63, 
72). However, clinical decision making demands widely used cate￾gorical classifications. TRV = 2.5 m/s represents 2 SD above the pop￾ulation mean; TRV ≥ 3 m/s is 3 SD above the mean. SCD patients 
with TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s have a lower exercise capacity and survival time 
(Figure 1). For example, in the Créteil study, probability of death was 
low in SCD patients with a TRV ≤ 2.5 m/s, while a TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s was 
associated with a hazard ratio of 6.81 in multivariate analysis and 
rose linearly above this value with a 50% probability of death at TRV 
= 3.2 m/s (63). These findings are consistent with other large cohort 
studies (19, 51, 63, 72), as results from both the NIH-PH cohort 
and the Paris cohort suggest that approximately 64%–75% of SCD 
patients with TRV ≥ 3 m/s have PH defined by pulmonary artery 
catheterization documentation of mean pulmonary artery pres￾sure greater than 25 mmHg, approximately 3 SD above the normal 
mean value (64, 65). SCD patients who fall into the intermediate 
category of TRV = 2.5–2.9 m/s (between 2 and 3 SD from the mean) 
have intermediate exercise capacity and mortality, falling squarely 
between the TRV ≤ 2.5 m/s group and the TRV ≥ 3 m/s group. Cath￾eterization studies indicated that about 25% of these patients have 
a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mmHg, support￾ing the low but significant predictive value of an intermediate TRV 
for identifying patients at risk of PH (65). Thus, the TRV category is 
predictive of the risk of both PH and mortality. TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s also 
predicts a higher risk of leg ulcers (46, 60), thrombosis (58), protein￾uria (60, 73), and exercise intolerance (74, 75), suggesting that it also 
serves as a marker for more general vasculopathy.
Meta-analysis helped sort out the many different studies of 
the prevalence and risk of high TRV in SCD. This meta-analysis 
included 45 studies from 15 countries and 6,109 patients (47). 
Figure 1. Tricuspid regurgitant velocity on echocardiogram is a physiolog￾ical biomarker that predicts survival and functional outcomes. Tricuspid 
regurgitant velocity (TRV) that is less than two SD below the population 
mean is in the normal range (<2.5 m/s), is associated with normal calculated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressures (PASP, <25 mmHg), and generally corre￾sponds to a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP, <20 mmHg), good long￾term survival, and good exercise tolerance, as indicated by a higher 6-minute 
walk distance (>400 m). Conversely, highly elevated TRV that is more than 3 
SD above the mean (≥3 m/s) is strongly associated with poor exercise toler￾ance with lower 6-minute walk distance (<400 m), pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure greater than 40 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure greater 
than 25 mmHg on right heart catheterization, and significantly poorer 
long-term survival. Intermediate TRV level (2.5–2.9 m/s) is associated with 
intermediate risk of exercise intolerance and mortality. Figure is adapted

with TRV elevations and impairments in 
flow-mediated vasodilation, a measure 
of endothelial NOS–dependent vasodi￾lation (80). In the Berkeley sickle mouse, 
high plasma hemoglobin levels correlat￾ed with impaired blood flow responses to 
infusions of the NO donor sodium nitro￾prusside (81). In a recent study, a specif￾ic hemoglobin-scavenging peptide that 
depleted the levels of plasma hemoglobin 
restored endothelial NOS–dependent 
vasodilation (82).
PH in other animal models of hemoly￾sis. Multiple mouse models of hemolysis 
exhibited increased plasma hemoglobin 
and increased plasma NO scavenging 
and developed spontaneous PH and right 
heart failure, including Berkeley sickle 
cell (78), spherocytosis (83), α-thalas￾semia (84), PNH (85), and alloimmune 
hemolysis mice (78).
NO resistance. NO resistance is charac￾terized by impaired vasodilatory respons￾es to infusions of NO donors, pulmonary and systemic vasocon￾striction, and PH. In animals, inducing intravascular hemolysis or 
infusing hemoglobin or hemolysate can produce experimental NO 
resistance (86–89). This effect is attributable to hemoglobin and 
NO scavenging, as it can be blocked by oxidization of hemoglobin 
to methemoglobin with inhaled NO gas or by binding and clearance 
of hemoglobin with haptoglobin (86, 89–91). Acute intravascular 
hemolysis induced by hypotonic water infusion in mice inhibits NO 
signaling and causes inflammation, an effect phenocopied by acute 
NO inhibition using chemical NO scavengers and reversed by an NO 
donor and haptoglobin (92). Haptoglobin prevents extravasation of 
free hemoglobin into interstitial spaces, where it scavenges NO (91).
Stored blood and vasomotor defect. Infusing aged stored blood 
into rodents (89, 93, 94) and humans (90, 95) causes intravascu￾lar hemolysis, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, and vascu￾lar endothelial dysfunction (due to impaired NO signaling) that 
can be blocked by haptoglobin (96). These effects are not always 
observed in models or patient populations in which hemolysis is 
not as severe, the dose of transfused red cells is not large, and the 
existing compensatory reserves of haptoglobin, hemopexin, and 
catalytic antioxidants are not as chronically depleted as in SCD.
Malaria endothelial dysfunction. Animal and human malaria 
is associated with intravascular hemolysis, increases in plasma 
hemoglobin, and impaired NO signaling. Higher level of plasma 
hemoglobin correlates in patients with impaired endothelial func￾tion (97, 98) and increased estimated pulmonary artery pressures 
(99). In animal models, it is linked to lowered NO scavenging and 
increased risk of death (21). Inhaled NO is protective in rodent 
models of malaria (21, 100, 101).
Hemolysis, plasma heme, and erythrocyte 
danger-associated molecular patterns
Free heme, another product of intravascular hemolysis, is released 
from free hemoglobin upon oxidation. Free heme is increasingly 
54% postcapillary). Exclusion of subjects likely underestimated 
the true prevalence of PH, because markers of renal insufficiency, 
hepatic dysfunction, and iron overload are independent risk fac￾tors for high estimated pulmonary artery pressure in SCD. Patients 
with right heart catheterization–documented PH had lower hemo￾globin and higher LDH values and higher prevalence of prior leg 
ulcers, and all deaths occurred in this subgroup (65).
All of these right heart catheterization screening studies like￾ly underestimate PH prevalence, as not all patients with elevated 
TRV agreed to catheterization. The differences and similarities 
between these three studies are summarized in Table 2.
Evidence linking cell-free hemoglobin 
to SCD complications
Epidemiological studies of the associations between PH and oth￾er vasculopathic subphenotypes of SCD have been supported by 
mechanistically focused studies. The primary hypothesis that intra￾vascular hemolysis releases cell-free plasma hemoglobin and argin￾ase 1 to inactivate the NO signaling axis and redox balance was stud￾ied over the last 10 years in animal models and in vivo in humans. In 
addition to studies in humanized transgenic sickle cell mice, studies 
have now been performed in other diseases with significant intra￾vascular hemolysis, including murine models of PNH, thalassemia, 
and malaria, and aged-blood transfusion models. Many of the stud￾ies test causality, with the addition of hemoglobin and hemoglobin 
inhibition by oxidation and haptoglobin therapy. We briefly review 
the preclinical and clinical experimental evidence below.
Vasomotor defect in SCD. SCD patients and sickle transgen￾ic mice have impaired vasodilator responses to NO that are pro￾portional to levels of plasma hemoglobin (16, 78–80). In humans, 
impaired NO signaling, directly measured via venous occlusion 
strain-gauge plethysmography, correlates with high levels of plas￾ma hemoglobin and LDH (16). This was recently confirmed in a 
study of SCD patients correlating high plasma hemoglobin levels

appreciated as an additional important mediator of inflammation 
and vascular injury (102, 103). In sickle cell mice, free heme drives 
inflammation, vaso-occlusion, and coagulation that are blocked 
by the heme scavenger hemopexin (104–109). In cultured cells, 
heme promotes secretion of high levels of placenta growth factor 
(110), which in turn induces release of the potent vasoconstrictor 
endothelin 1 (111), a common mediator of PH. Heme is a potent 
source of oxidant stress, but it does not scavenge NO.
Hemoglobin oxidation is driven not only by reaction with NO 
(112), but also by reaction with a host of additional physiological 
oxidants (113–118). Ferric and ferryl forms of hemoglobin pro￾duced in SCD and other forms of hemolysis are highly reactive 
in promoting oxidation (119–121). Hemolysis also produces red 
cell microparticles that can deliver toxic heme to endothelial cells 
(122, 123). Heme species appear to activate innate immune sterile 
inflammation pathways through TLR4 and NALP inflammasome 
signaling (104, 105, 124, 125). As such, these hemolysis products 
are proposed to represent erythrocyte danger-associated molecular 
patterns (eDAMPs), which promote and propagate sterile inflam￾matory and oxidative stress, further impairing the redox balance 
(126, 127). eDAMP release and oxidation of plasma hemoglobin 
to methemoglobin, which is necessary for the release of heme, are 
likely enhanced during acute vaso-occlusive episodes. To date, a 
careful stoichiometric analysis of cell-free hemoglobin levels, heme 
levels, and heme in microparticles during sickle vaso-occlusion has 
not been performed. Heme, hemoglobin, and red cell ADP activate 
platelets and stimulate platelet mitochondria to produce ROS and 
cause an oxidative enzymopathy of complex V (the ATPase), result￾ing in platelet activation, thrombospondin-1 and PDGF release, and 
promotion of inflammation and vasculopathy (128). eDAMPs trig￾ger innate immune responses, perhaps in the setting of LPS-prim￾ing of the NALP3 inflammasome, and might be central to the sterile 
inflammation that is characteristic of sickle vaso-occlusion.
In this context, we propose that steady-state intravascular 
hemolysis primarily inhibits NO signaling and amplifies ROS 
formation, tipping the redox balance and producing endotheli￾al dysfunction (Figure 2). With advancing age, this effect drives 
development of vasculopathic complications that characterize the 
subphenotypes of SCD most closely associated with hemolysis. 
Steady-state inflammation and increased blood viscosity also pro￾mote cellular adhesion and vaso-occlusion, leading to acute pain￾ful episodes and organ ischemia/reperfusion injury. These mecha￾Figure 2. Contribution of intravascular hemolysis to vasculopathy and vasoocclusion. Intravascular hemolysis produces free hemoglobin, which drives 
Fenton reactions to produce oxidants and scavenges NO by a dioxygenation reaction. Intravascular hemolysis also releases red cell arginase 1 into plasma, 
where it can deplete plasma L-arginine (L-Arg), the required substrate for NO production by eNOS. Oxidized hemoglobin releases free heme, which can 
activate release of placenta growth factor (PIGF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). These combined pathways contribute to chronic vasculopathy, platelet activation, 
and pulmonary hypertension. Heme also primes the innate immune system to acute rises in endogenous (HMGB1) and exogenous (LPS) ligands of TLR4. 
These in turn activate production of ROS, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and downstream activation of the inflammasome, producing inflammatory 
cytokines and other mediators that promote expression of adhesion receptors and ligands on endothelium and blood cells. Intravascular hemolysis also 
releases adenine nucleotides, including ATP and ADP, which further contributes to platelet activation. There is also some evidence that adenosine binds 
receptors on red cells, resulting in increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and sphingosine-1-phosphate, associated with lower oxygen affinity of hemoglobin 
(not shown). Proteins on the surface of the activated endothelium (P-selectin, E-selectin, VCAM1, ICAM1) interact with adhesive platelets, neutrophils, and 
sickle erythrocytes, producing vasoocclusion and acute chest syndrome. Intravascular hemolysis also releases asymmetric dimethylarginine, which inhibits 
eNOS. CRP, C-reactive protein; SAA, serum amyloid A; Orn, ornithine. Adapted with permission from Gladwin, et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation (150).

nisms intersect, perhaps during severe vaso-occlusive painful crisis 
when acute hemolysis is triggered and oxidant stress enhances 
hemoglobin oxidation and heme release. This intersection acti￾vates primed innate immune signaling pathways and the inflam￾masome, leading to multisystem injury and acute lung injury.
Controversies regarding the hyperhemolysis model
The role of hyperhemolysis as a proximate cause of some SCD 
complications has drawn criticism. In some cases, this was a dis￾pute over nomenclature; in others, similar data were interpreted 
differently (11, 12). Importantly, the debate has not centered on 
reproducibility, as strong associations between morbidity and 
mortality and measures of cell-free plasma hemoglobin and oth￾er markers of hemolysis, TRV, and PH remain robust. Similarly, 
strong consensus surrounds the vasoactivity and injurious effects 
of hemolysate, cell-free hemoglobin, and heme. Some of these 
controversies actually represent consensus, and are summarized 
in the following objections and responses:
Echocardiography-defined TRV is not adequate to diagnose PH. 
This is clearly true. TRV is a physiological biomarker representing 
PH risk, much as transcranial Doppler velocity represents stroke 
risk in children with SCA. PH diagnosis requires pulmonary artery 
catheterization. TRV ≥ 3 m/s appears to have about 75% specificity 
for PH in adults with SCD (64, 65). TRV ≥ 2.5 m/s specificity is 
approximately 25% for PH, but the addition of abnormally short 
6-minute walk distance (64) or elevated serum NT-proBNP (65) 
can enhance identification of high-risk patients in this intermedi￾ate TRV group. Elevated TRV unequivocally represents a higher 
risk of PH diagnosed by right heart catheterization (19, 64), but this 
can be confounded by high cardiac output, error in the estimation 
of TRV, and other sources of variability. TRV also represents an 
elevated risk of impaired exercise tolerance, proteinuria, venous 
thromboembolism, and mortality (Figure 1 and refs. 58, 129, 130).
PH does not occur in 34% of SCD adults. This is correct. Approxi￾mately 6%–10% of SCD adults have PH defined by a mean pulmo￾nary artery pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg, measured 
by pulmonary artery catheterization (64–66). However, another 
25% of patients have mildly elevated TRV, which is prognostically 
significant, as discussed above, and mean pressures between 20 
and 25 mmHg are abnormally high and likely consequential.
PH in SCD is caused by left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Sev￾eral echocardiography and right heart catheterization studies have 
shown that half of PH cases in SCD involve precapillary PH consis￾tent with inappropriately high pulmonary vascular resistance, lead￾ing to right ventricular hypertrophy and failure (64–66, 74, 131). 
The other half comprise postcapillary PH, associated with a stiff left 
ventricle due to ventricular hypertrophy and linked to anemia and 
chronically high cardiac output (64–66, 68, 74). Even in patients 
with high left atrial pressures, the risk of death most closely asso￾ciates with increases in the intrinsic pulmonary vascular resistance 
(high pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary pressure 
gradient). An additional mechanism of cardiomyocyte dropout and 
cardiomyopathy has been found in sickle mice (132).
Serum LDH is not a good biomarker of hemolysis. In large popula￾tion studies, LDH values in homozygous SS patients are correlated 
with higher levels of more direct markers of intravascular hemoly￾sis, cell-free plasma hemoglobin, and red cell–derived microparti￾cles (89). LDH values also correlate in human physiological stud￾ies with an impaired response to NO donor infusions. However, 
LDH has limitations as a marker of hemolysis, since it is released 
by lytic damage of almost any tissue, which occurs in patients 
with SCD. Its assay methodology varies among different clinical 
laboratories, complicating multicenter analyses. Serum LDH is a 
biomarker of intravascular hemolysis, which releases free hemo￾globin and arginase. Both are integral to the hyperhemolysis mod￾el of NO scavenging (10). Phagocytosis of damaged red cells by 
macrophages or extravascular hemolysis is not expected to release 
free hemoglobin or LDH into plasma. Red cell survival studies do 
not distinguish between extravascular and intravascular hemoly￾sis (133). Significant variability in serum LDH in steady-state SCD 
adults is provided by LDH isoforms originating from red cells but 
also found in renal cells (20). Until better biomarkers for intravas￾cular hemolysis are available, only serum LDH, aspartate amino￾transferase, and plasma hemoglobin can be used to imperfectly 
indicate intensity of intravascular hemolysis.
Decreased NO bioavailability cannot be the sole mechanism of 
vasculopathy in SCD. This is also correct. Published data evidence 
the involvement of oxidative stress (79, 100, 105, 108, 113, 115, 116, 
121, 123, 132, 134, 135), inflammation (9, 22, 27, 32, 101, 105–108, 
115, 124–127, 134), dyslipidemia (135–138), microparticles (89, 122, 
123, 139), and vasoactive peptides (110, 111, 140–143). These addi￾tional pathways (depicted in Figure 2) are potentially additive or 
synergistic to intravascular hemolysis–like mechanisms. We note 
that hemolysis potently impairs redox balance, lowering NO sig￾naling and enhancing pathological ROS signaling.
Markers of hemolysis do not correlate with red cell survival. A recent 
study limited to 13 measurements failed to find such correlations 
(133). This small study considered only 11 pediatric SCA patients 
with very low levels of basal hemolysis based on hydroxyurea treat￾ment, many with α-thalassemia trait, and most having unusually 
high levels of HbF (10 of 13 measurements came from patients with 
HbF levels greater than 9%, including one of 33.8%). Measuring 
correlations of hemolysis markers in patients with limited hemo￾lysis does not adequately test biomarkers. These studies should be 
performed in adult patients with clinically relevant ranges of hemo￾lytic severity. Additionally, red cell survival (total hemolysis) in SCD 
is believed to be dominated by extravascular hemolysis (144), which 
is not the mechanism proposed to scavenge NO. Presently, plasma 
hemoglobin, serum LDH, and AST, with all their limitations, remain 
the best available biomarkers of intravascular hemolysis. Intravas￾cular hemolysis must not be confused with extravascular hemolysis.
Conclusions
Epidemiological associations and mechanistic causal testing sup￾port the pathogenic role of intravascular hemolysis in SCD. New 
understanding of the role of red cell hemolysis products, redox 
disequilibrium, and eDAMPs in the end-organ injury observed in 
SCD provides a pathway for identifying counterregulatory signal￾ing pathways that might dampen sterile inflammation and oxida￾tive stress, e.g., upregulation and protective polymorphisms in the 
heme oxygenase-1 enzyme (134, 145). Upstream activation of the 
KEAP1/NRF2 redox sensing transcription pathway, a central coun￾terregulatory program that protects against oxidative and hemolyt￾ic stress, is being actively investigated as a therapy for SCD (146,

olized in vivo to form NO (92, 149). Finally, intravascular hemoly￾sis is surely not the only source of vasculopathy in SCD, and more 
vigorous research is needed on the role of oxidases, oxidant stress, 
eDAMPs, and the inflammasome pathway.

147). As clinical trials are planned, it will be vital to target drugs 
to specific subphenotypes of SCD when considering treatments 
beyond the direct inhibition of deoxy-HbS polymerization. Given 
the results of the Gardos channel inhibitor clinical trial, new drugs 
that reduce hemolysis and increase hemoglobin levels should be 
used cautiously, possibly in combination with optimal dosing of 
hydroxyurea or other agents that directly inhibit HbS polymeriza￾tion by inducing high levels of HbF, or another mechanism to limit 
viscosity, inflammation, and vaso-occlusion and its complications. 
Drugs that promote cGMP signaling, such as soluble guanylate 
cyclase stimulators, should be tested with caution, as the phospho￾diesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil induced painful crisis in clinical tri￾als (148). Development of promising hemoglobin- and heme-scav￾enging agents is likely limited to more acute therapy in the setting 
of hyperhemolysis, akin to the use of eculizumab for hemolytic 
uremic syndrome. Common nodes that intersect both hemolysis￾endothelial dysfunction and viscosity/vaso-occlusion, such as the 
KEAP1/NRF2 pathway and NALP3 inflammasome, might be ideal 
targets for therapy. Hydroxyurea is a prototype for such an agent, 
as it inhibits HbS polymerization via HbF induction and is metab￾1. van Beers EJ, et al. Imaging flow cytometry for
