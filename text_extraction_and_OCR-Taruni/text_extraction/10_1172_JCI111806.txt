Abstract
Plasma and urine free and acyl carnitine were measured in 19
children with nephropathic cystinosis and renal Fanconi syn￾drome. Each patient exhibited a deficiency of plasma free
carnitine (mean 11.7±4.0 [SDI nmol/ml) compared with normal
control values (42.0±9.0 nmol/ml) (P < 0.001). Mean plasma
acyl carnitine in the cystinotic subjects was normal. Four
subjects with Fanconi syndrome but not cystinosis displayed
the same abnormal pattern of plasma carnitine levels; controls
with acidosis or a lysosomal storage disorder (Fabry disease),
but not Fanconi syndrome, had entirely normal plasma carnitine
levels. Two postrenal transplant subjects with cystinosis but
without Fanconi syndrome also had normal plasma carnitine
levels. Absolute amounts of urinary free carnitine were elevated
in cystinotic individuals with Fanconi syndrome. In all 21
subjects with several different etiologies for the Fanconi syn￾drome, the mean fractional excretion of free carnitine (33%)
as well as acyl carnitine (26%) greatly exceeded normal values
(3 and 5%, respectively). Total free carnitine excretion in
Fanconi syndrome patients correlated with total amino acid
excretion (r = 0.76). Two cystinotic patients fasted for 24 h
and one idiopathic Fanconi syndrome patient fasted for 5 h
showed normal increases in plasma fl-hydroxybutyrate and
acetoacetate, which suggested that hepatic fatty acid oxidation
was intact despite very low plasma free carnitine levels. Muscle
biopsies from two cystinotic subjects with Fanconi syndrome
and plasma carnitine deficiency had 8.5 and 13.1 umol free
carnitine per milligram of noncollagen protein, respectively
(normal controls, 22.3 and 17.1); total carnitines were 11.8
and 13.3 nmol/mg noncollagen protein (controls 33.5, 20.0).
One biopsy revealed a mild increase in lipid droplets. The
other showed mild myopathic features with variation in muscle
fiber size, small vacuoles, and an increase in lipid droplets. In
renal Fanconi syndrome, failure to reabsorb free and acyl
carnitine results in a secondary plasma and muscle free carnitine
deficiency.
Introduction
The renal tubular Fanconi syndrome consists of a generalized
transport defect in tubular reabsorption of small molecules,
including water, glucose, organic acids, amino acids, and

inorganic ions such as phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium,
magnesium, and bicarbonate. Individuals with nephropathic
cystinosis, who have growth retardation and eventually develop
renal insufficiency, represent the largest group of children with
a known etiology for their Fanconi syndrome, which usually
appears by 1 yr of age (1). As a result of their Fanconi
syndrome, patients with cystinosis experience the consequences
of poor tubular reabsorption, including vasopressin-resistant
polyuria which leads to dehydration, acidosis, and hypophos￾phatemic rickets. Conservative therapy is designed to correct
renal losses by provision of supplemental fluids, electrolytes,
alkali, phosphate, and calcium (1, 2).
This form of treatment, however, supplies only those
nutrients generally known to be deficient in Fanconi syndrome
patients. A number of other molecules normally reabsorbed
by the kidney may also be lost by these patients, thus requiring
replacement. One possible lost substance is carnitine, fl-hydroxy-
'y-trimethylaminobutyric acid, a small molecule that is similar
in size and charge distribution to an amino acid. Carnitine,
which exists either free or as a fatty acyl ester, is required for
transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial
membrane before fatty acid oxidation and energy production
(3, 4). Human cardiac and skeletal muscle, and to a lesser
extent liver and kidney, contain relatively high amounts of
carnitine, which is supplied to muscle and other noncarnitine￾producing tissues by transport from the plasma (5). The plasma
concentration of carnitine varies with renal filtration (6, 7)
and reabsorption (8), potentially making plasma carnitine
levels vulnerable to reduction in renal Fanconi syndrome.
Carnitine depletion can be secondary or primary, and is
characterized clinically by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy,
or fasting hypoglycemia (3, 9-14).
In this paper, we report plasma and urinary concentrations
of free, total, and acylated carnitine in 22 subjects with the
Fanconi syndrome, including 19 children with nephropathic
cystinosis, a disorder of cystine transport across the lysosomal
membrane (15, 16). Their values were compared with those
of normal individuals and control subjects with related disor￾ders. Tissue (muscle) levels of carnitine were also measured in
two cystinotic children with Fanconi syndrome and plasma
carnitine deficiency.
Subjects (see Table I). Children with nephropathic cystinosis
age 1-11 yr were diagnosed on the basis of typical corneal
cystine crystals, renal Fanconi syndrome, and elevated leucocyte
cystine content (1). Most were enrolled in the National Col￾laborative Cysteamine Study and received an average of 58
mg/kg per d of cysteamine free base in four divided doses.
Cysteamine is a free thiol that is used as a cystine-depleting
agent with some clinical effectiveness (17, 18). Subject 18 was
receiving pantethine rather than cysteamine as a cystine￾depleting agent (19). Cystinotic patients also received supple￾mental polycitra, potassium, phosphate, and calcium as needed.

Two brothers with oculocerebrorenal (Lowe) syndrome
were diagnosed on the basis of congenital cataracts, mental
retardation, renal tubular acidosis, proteinuria, and aminoaci￾duria. They received supplemental phosphate and citrate. One
patient with an idiopathic form of Fanconi syndrome (A) had
hepatomegaly and corneal clouding with electrolyte imbalance.
Another (B) had hepatomegaly, severe rickets, ketonuria, and
fasting hypoglycemia without lactic acidosis. Two postrenal
transplant cystinosis patients had each received a kidney
transplant 4 yr before testing. The older of the two was taking
prednisone every other day, plus azathioprine and L-thyroxine.
The younger was receiving prednisone every other day, plus
azathioprine, propranolol, and hydralazine. Although cystine
continued to accumulate in all nonrenal tissues of these
subjects, they had functioning kidneys with creatinine clearances
of 107 and 54 ml/min per 1.73 mm, respectively. Two brothers
with 5-oxoprolinuria and deficient fibroblast glutathione syn￾thetase activity (20) had acidosis treated with sodium citrate
(1.7 and 3.2 meq/kg per d, respectively). A 15-yr-old boy with
Fabry disease had typical corneal opacities, scrotal and umbilical
angiokeratomata, acroparesthesias, and a-galactosidase A de￾ficiency documented in both plasma and leukocytes. His renal
function, including tubular reabsorption, was unimpaired and
he was receiving no medication at the time of this study.
All subjects were either inpatients or outpatients at the
National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or the Medical
College of Virginia. Informed consent was obtained from these
patients or from their parents. Normal controls consisted of
anonymous blood bank donors and volunteers.
Methods
1-'4C-Acetyl coenzyme A (50 mCi/mmol) was obtained from New
England Nuclear (Boston, MA) and from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Irvine,
CA, and Plainview, NJ), which also supplied sodium tetrathionate.
Ultrapure Tris was from Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals (India￾napolis, IN), and AG1-X8 resin, 200-400 mesh, was from Bio-Rad
Laboratories (Richmond, CA). Acetyl coenzyme A, L-carnitine and
carnitine acetyltransferase were products of Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO).
Free and total carnitine in plasma and urine were assayed according
to McGarry and Foster (21), except that AG1-X8 resin was used in
place of the obsolete Dowex 1-X 10. Addition of 0-6 nmol of carnitine
to plasma gave recovery rates of 80-90%. The intraassay and interassay
coefficients of variation were 2.7% (n = 10) and 7.8% (n = 5), respec￾tively. Heparinized or sodium EDTA plasma, obtained from nonfasting
subjects, as well as 24-h urine aliquots, were frozen at -20°C for <3
mo, during which time there was no reduction in measured carnitine
content.
Open muscle biopsies, taken from the quadriceps muscle, were
fresh-frozen in isopentane, cooled to -160°C in liquid nitrogen, and
processed for muscle enzyme histochemistry as described (22). Muscle
carnitine was measured as described (23). Creatinine was assayed by
the Jaffe reaction. Urine dipsticks for ketones indicated that none of
the Fanconi syndrome patients had sufficient acetoacetate to cause an
error in the creatinine or creatinine clearance determinations using
this method (24, 25). Blood levels of acetoacetate and (1-hydroxybutyrate
were measured as described (26). Dicarboxylic acids were examined
by gas chromatography.
Amino acids in urine, deproteinized with 5% sulfosalicylic acid,
were quantitated using an LKB 4150 alpha amino acid analyzer (LKB
Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) with five lithium buffers.
As a measure of total amino acid output in a 24-h urine, 21 amino
acids were quantitated: aspartic acid, hydroxyproline, threonine, serine, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, glycine, alanine, valine,
one-half cystine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine,
ornithine, lysine, histidine, and arginine. Total daily amino acid
excretion for nine normal subjects (four adults and five children) was
94.0±45.1 (SD) ;imol/kg per d (range 38.5-155.1); for 21 children
with Fanconi syndrome, total amino acid excretion was 1,085.0±725.3
(SD) gmol/kg per d (range 342.1-3,554.5).
Fractional excretion of carnitine was calculated as 100 X (unne
carnitine X serum creatinine)/(serum carnitine X urine creatinine).
Results
Each of 19 children age 20 mo- 1 yr, with nephropathic
cystinosis and renal Fanconi syndrome, had a plasma free
carnitine level below the normal range (Table I). As a group,
children with cystinosis averaged 12 nmol free carnitine per
milliliter of plasma, which was significantly less than the
normal mean of 42 nmol/ml (P < 0.001). Plasma acylcarnitine
levels were not decreased, so the large difference in total
plasma carnitine between cystinotic and normal subjects (P
< 0.001) reflected the substantial free carnitine deficiency in
the patients. The abnormally low free carnitine levels in
cystinotic children were not related to age, serum creatinine,
or cysteamine therapy. (Subjects 1, 12, 16, and 18 were not
receiving cysteamine.) Subject 15, with late onset cystinosis
and mild aminoaciduria, had a plasma free carnitine level
approaching the normal range.
Two brothers with oculocerebrorenal syndrome and Fanconi
syndrome had low free plasma carnitine levels (Table I). Two
other patients with severe idiopathic forms of Fanconi syndrome
also had markedly decreased free and total plasma carnitines.
In contrast, two brothers with 5-oxoprolinuria and acidosis,
but not Fanconi syndrome, had normal free, acyl, and total
plasma carnitines. A boy with the lysosomal storage disorder,
Fabry disease, but without renal dysfunction, also had plasma
carnitine levels in the normal range. Finally, two postrenal
transplant subjects who had cystinosis but not Fanconi syn￾drome had normal plasma carnitine levels and normal or
nearly normal fractional carnitine excretions (Table I).
As others have reported (27-30), daily urinary excretion
of free and acylcarnitine varied widely in all subjects, including
the cystinotic patients (Table I). Free carnitine excretion in
cystinotics (4.8±1.8 ,umol/kg per d) exceeded that in normal
subjects (3.0±0.5 ,umol/kg per d), while acyl carnitine excretion
did not differ significantly from normal (Table I) (26). Nev￾ertheless, the amounts of urinary free carnitine are abnormal
in the presence of very low plasma levels. In fact, the mean
fractional excretions of free and acyl carnitine in 18 cystinotic
patients, two oculocerebrorenal syndrome patients with Fanconi
syndrome, and one idiopathic Fanconi syndrome subject were
33.2±28.3 (SD)% and 25.8±17.1%, respectively. These values
far exceeded previously published norms (6, 8, 28) for free
carnitine fractional excretion (1-2%), as well as our own
control values for both free (2.8±0.9%) and acyl (5.3±2.2%)
carnitine fractional excretions (Table I, P < 0.001).
To further investigate the relationship between carnitine
excretion and renal Fanconi syndrome, total daily urinary free
carnitine was plotted against total daily amino acid excretion
(see Methods) for the 21 subjects with Fanconi syndrome and
amino aciduria (Fig. 1). Free carnitine excretion increased
directly with amino acid excretion (r = 0.76). Subject 15 was
unusual in that she had late onset cystinosis that was diagnosed
at 6 yr of age, mild amino aciduria, mild carnitine deficiency
(Table I), and was a carrier for a-galactosidase A deficiency.

excretion in subjects with renal Fanconi syndrome. Each number
represents the corresponding cystinotic subject listed in Table I. The
symbols (x) refer to the brothers with oculocerebrorenal syndrome,
and (A) refers to one of the idiopathic Fanconi syndrome subjects.
Amino acid excretion is defined in Methods.
Excluding her data, the correlation coefficient for the data in
Fig. 1 was 0.86. Free carnitine excretion correlated poorly with
weight (r = 0.54), and there was little correlation between
acylcarnitine excretion and amino acid excretion (r = 0.30).
Since most of the Fanconi syndrome patients were deficient
in plasma free carnitine to the same extent as reported in
systemic carnitine deficiency (6), we examined whether they
were functionally impaired in fatty acid oxidation as well.
Three patients underwent a fasting study (Table II). Two
cystinotic patients showed no evidence of hypoglycemia or
dicarboxylic aciduria after 24 h of fasting; they also had a
normal rise in f3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate levels (31).
The patient with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome became hypo￾glycemic after 5 h of fasting, but also showed a normal rise in
plasma f3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Assuming constant
ketone utilization, this would indicate increased ketone pro￾duction consistent with normal hepatic fatty acid oxidation.
Two patients with Fanconi syndrome and carnitine defi￾ciency underwent quadriceps muscle biopsies. Subject 11 had
muscle free and total carnitine levels of 13.1 and 13.3 nmol/
mg of noncollagen protein; the values for subject 5 were 8.5
and 11.8. Our normal control values of 17.1 and 22.3 nmol
of free carnitine and 20.0 and 33.5 nmol of total carnitine per
milligram of noncollagen protein correspond well to literature
values (3, 11). The biopsy from subject 11 showed increased
lipid droplets. The muscle of subject 5 revealed mild myopathic
features with variation in muscle fiber size, small vacuoles,
occasional ragged-red fibers, and increased accumulation of
lipid droplets with Sudan black and oil-red-O stains (Fig. 2).
These morphologic findings are consistent with muscle carnitine
deficiency.
Discussion
In man, the biosynthesis of carnitine begins with lysine (4).
The conversion of lysine to butyrobetaine occurs in most
tissues, but hydroxylation of butyrobetaine to carnitine takes
place largely in the liver, kidney, and testis (5). Carnitine is
transported through the blood to tissues such as skeletal and
cardiac muscle, which require it for transport of long chain
fatty acids into mitochondria. The uptake of carnitine by
different organs is determined by tissue-specific fluxes from
the plasma (5, 32). Plasma concentrations are influenced by
diet as well as de novo synthesis, and deficiency states due to
poor dietary intake in neonates (33), as well as apparently
impaired production of carnitine (13), have been reported.
Recently, however, the role of the kidney in regulating
plasma carnitine levels has been increasingly recognized. Car￾nitine is filtered by the kidney; hence, there are elevated
muscle (34) and plasma (35) levels of carnitine in patients
with renal insufficiency. Hemodialysis lowers free carnitine
levels (34, 35). This finding, as well as in vitro equilibrium
dialysis experiments (36), indicates that carnitine is unbound
or only loosely bound by plasma proteins. Thus, the mainte￾nance of normal plasma carnitine levels depends on tubular
reabsorption, which under normal circumstances efficiently
reclaims 98-99% of the filtered load of free carnitine (6, 8, 28)
and 77-99% of the filtered load of acyl carnitine (28). The

transport of L-carnitine across rat renal brush border membranes
has been reported to be structure specific and sodium gradient
dependent (37). It has not been determined whether carnitine
is acylated in the kidney before excretion, or whether any form
of carnitine is secreted. However, carnitine infusions have
resulted in an increased fractional excretion of both free and
total carnitine, which is consistent with a discrete tubular
reabsorption maximum for both free and acyl carnitine (6).
Although this was not specifically measured in the present
study, patients with cystinosis may have a markedly reduced
tubular reabsorption maximum for carnitine as part of their
Fanconi syndrome (Table I, Fig. 1); the role of reabsorption
in the renal handling of free carnitine is emphasized by the
fact that even cystinotic children with increased serum creati￾nines manifest very low plasma free carnitine levels (Table I).
All 21 individuals with Fanconi syndrome had increased
fractional excretions of both free and acyl carnitine without
carnitine loading. This abnormality was manifest by a reduction
in mean plasma free carnitine concentration to 28% of normal
(Table I). The normalcy of plasma acyl carnitine may be
related to the relative rates of synthesis (interconversion with
free carnitine) and catabolism which, along with excretion,
determine steady state levels.
The high fractional excretions and low plasma concentra￾tions of free carnitine were related to Fanconi syndrome and
not to cystinosis per se. Two cystinotic subjects who had
received renal transplants and no longer had Fanconi syndrome
exhibited normal plasma carnitines and fractional excretions
of carnitine within or near the normal range (Table I). In
addition, marked plasma carnitine deficiency was seen in four
noncystinotic subjects, two with an idiopathic type of Fanconi
syndrome and two with the tubular reabsorption defect of
oculocerebrorenal (Lowe) syndrome. The subjects with these
disorders, as well as the four cystinotic patients who were not
receiving cysteamine (17), also provided evidence against the
possibility that the drug cysteamine lowered free plasma car￾nitine levels. Normal carnitine concentrations in patients with
5-oxoprolinuria and Fabry disease indicate that the low levels
in cystinotic patients were not due to generalized metabolic
acidosis or lysosomal storage, respectively. The correlation
between free carnitine excretion and amino acid excretion
(Fig. 1) further supports the renal tubular etiology of the
plasma free carnitine deficiency. The fact that free carnitine
excretion correlated with amino acid excretion better than did
acyl carnitine excretion helps differentiate this plasma carnitine
deficiency from that found in organic acidurias (3, 38, 39), in
which acylcarnitine excretion may be the primary cause of
plasma carnitine deficiency. However, this finding has been
disputed (40).
Low plasma total carnitine in association with Fanconi
syndrome has been reported in two individuals (28, 41-43),
both of whom had multisystem involvement. One patient, a
3-yr-old girl with mitochondrial cytopathy and Fanconi syn￾drome (28), had a fractional excretion of free carnitine of
8.2%. The other patient presented at age four with psychomotor
retardation, impaired liver function, hyperammonemia, an
episode of hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, and renal Fanconi
syndrome (41). Urinary free carnitine excretion was increased,
and serum free and total carnitine were 3.5 and 9.6 nmol/ml,
respectively. These increased to 10.7 and 24.7 nmol/ml after
5 mo of L-carnitine treatment, along with improved muscle
strength and scalp hair growth (43). Although carnitine clear￾ances were not reported, and several organ systems were
involved, this patient's carnitine deficiency was considered
secondary to the Fanconi syndrome.
The plasma concentrations of free and total carnitine in
our Fanconi syndrome patients were in the same range as
those reported for individuals with systemic carnitine deficiency
(6). However, the Fanconi syndrome patients did not appear
to have hepatic carnitine deficiency. Three patients with Fanconi
syndrome and plasma free carnitine deficiency who underwent
a fasting study showed no deficiency in ketone body production
(Table II). This would suggest that hepatic carnitine levels
were not depleted enough to functionally impair fatty acid
oxidation. Only the patient with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome
developed hypoglycemia, but it was probably not due to his
carnitine deficiency, since he had a brisk ketone body response.
In contrast to the apparent lack of hepatic involvement,
patients with Fanconi syndrome do appear to manifest muscle
carnitine deficiency, with moderate depressions in both free
and total carnitine levels, lipid droplet accumulation (Fig. 2),
and myopathic changes (subject 5). This situation is not
surprising, since the muscle depends upon delivery of carnitine
from the plasma for its supply, and plasma free carnitine levels
are low. However, the ability to transport carnitine into muscle
is not expected to be impaired in Fanconi syndrome; this
differentiates the condition from primary muscle carnitine
deficiency (3, 10) and suggests that elevating plasma free
carnitine will result in repletion of muscle carnitine. The lack
of hepatic involvement in Fanconi syndrome patients might
also be anticipated, since the liver is provided carnitine both
by its own synthetic machinery and by the portal circulation
before carnitine can be spilled through the kidney.
Our subjects with cystinosis and the Fanconi syndrome do
manifest poor muscular development, but no other overt signs
of systemic carnitine deficiency, which is characterized by
episodes of hypoglycemia, Reye syndrome-like encephalopathy,
and muscle weakness (3, 10, 11). Although patients with
systemic carnitine deficiency have exhibited a renal carnitine
leak, this alone cannot account for tissue carnitine depletion
in the disorder, since one normal control exhibited a similar
1128 1. Bernardini, W. B. Rizzo, M. Dalakas, J. Bernar, and W A. Gahl

renal carnitine leak (6). It appears that the renal defect is only
one component of a multisystem disorder, in which other
organ system involvement causes the more severe clinical
manifestations of systemic carnitine deficiency. Because only
one other organ system (muscle) appears secondarily involved
in Fanconi syndrome subjects, one might expect that the only
clinical impairment would be poor muscular development.
Nevertheless, acute stress or chronic illness may trigger other
clinical manifestations in such patients.
This investigation clearly establishes plasma and muscle
free carnitine deficiency as components of the various forms
of renal Fanconi syndrome, and verifies that the carnitine
deficiency is due to impaired tubular absorption per se, and
not solely due to involvement of other organ systems.
