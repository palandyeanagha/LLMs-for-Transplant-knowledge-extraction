Abstract
• Introduction: Forgotten or retained ureteric stents are a well-recognised phenomenon with the
potential to cause a range of complications, the most dangerous of which is obstructive
nephropathy. These risks are potentially devastating when the patient has a single functioning
transplanted kidney. Here we describe the case of a renal transplantation patient with a forgotten
ureteric stent of 10 years, who presented with irritative bladder symptoms and was successfully
managed using a multimodal urological approach with specialist advice on antibiotic prophylaxis. To
the best of our knowledge this is the longest documented time period for a forgotten ureteric stent
in a transplantation patient and is unusual in that obstructive nephropathy did not occur.
• Case presentation: A 32-year-old man with a history of end stage renal failure of unknown
aetiology received a cadaveric renal transplant in 1995. An indwelling JJ stent was placed at the time
of transplant to protect the vesicoureteric anastomosis. The patient made an unremarkable
recovery and initially attended regular follow up in the renal transplant clinic. He was subsequently
lost to transplant clinic follow up. In 2005 at the age of 42 he was referred to a nephrologist with
irritative bladder symptoms. Renal tract imaging with ultrasound and a plain film demonstrated a
retained encrusted ureteric stent.
• Conclusion: The removal of a retained encrusted ureteric stent always provides a urological
challenge. This case demonstrates that multimodal treatment involving a combination of
endourological and percutaneous techniques can be employed with success even when the patient
has a heavily encrusted stent for a single functioning transplanted kidney. Involvement of a
microbiologist to advise on prophylactic antibiotics is deemed especially useful, as the
immunosuppressed transplant patient is at particular risk of sepsis secondary to bacteraemia as a
result of the endoscopic manipulation of the colonised encrusted stent. This case also provides
further evidence to highlight the potential benefits of a stent registry.
Introduction
Ureteral stents are commonly used in the management of
urological problems. In addition to their importance as an
adjunct to ureteral reconstruction in renal transplant sur￾gery [1], other indications include relief of ureteral
obstruction, ensuring adequate postoperative drainage
and prevention of ureteral injury during surgery. [2]
Serious complications are however associated with their
use, especially when retained or forgotten. These include

migration, fragmentation, encrustation and stone forma￾tion, which can lead to obstructive nephropathy, a poten￾tially devastating consequence for a patient with a single
functioning kidney. [3] Nicol et al reported a 2.2% inci￾dence of stent complications in the renal transplant pop￾ulation. [1]
There are very few documented cases of forgotten ureteric
stents in renal transplant patients in the medical litera￾ture, probably because of regular outpatient follow up.
Here we present the case of a patient with a forgotten ure￾teric stent of 10 years who presented with irritative blad￾der symptoms and was successfully managed using a
multimodal urological approach.
Case presentation
A 32-year-old man with a history of end stage renal failure
of unknown aetiology received a cadaveric renal trans￾plant in 1995. An indwelling JJ stent was placed at the
time of transplant to protect the vesicoureteric anastomo￾sis. The patient made an unremarkable recovery and ini￾tially attended regular follow up in the renal transplant
clinic. He was lost to transplant clinic follow up after this
time.
In August 2005 the primary care physician expedited the
patient's routine appointment with the nephrologist
because of new symptoms of nocturia and poor urinary
stream. An ultrasound scan was performed demonstrating
moderate hydronephrosis and a calcified stent much to
the surprise of the radiologist, patient and nephrologists,
Figure 1. A Kidney-Ureter-Bladder (KUB) plain radio￾graph also demonstrated the calcified stent with bulky
encrustations at the renal pelvis and intra-vesical portions,
Figure 2. Biochemical assessment of renal function was
satisfactory.
In September 2005, at the age of 42, he underwent cysto￾scopic clearance of distal encrustations. Difficulty access￾ing the vesicoureteric orifice and proximal stone burden
rendered cystoscopic retrieval alone unrealistic. Percuta￾neous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was employed which
allowed destruction of the upper ureteric stones and
removal of the encrusted JJ stent in tact. A postoperative
nephrostogram demonstrated no residual calculi.
The patient continued to make an excellent recovery and
was relieved of his irritative bladder symptoms. A follow
up KUB radiograph confirmed clearance of all calculi, and
biochemical renal function tests remained satisfactory.
Discussion
A strict definition for 'forgotten' does not exist, however
many previous studies consider a period of greater than 6
months to constitute a forgotten stent. [2] It is also widely
considered that a retained stent is one that is irretrievable
cystoscopically and requires a further auxiliary interven￾tion. [4,5]

Several risk factors have been identified for the develop￾ment of stent encrustation. These include: a history of uro￾lithiasis, recurrent urinary tract infections, prolonged
stenting and stent composition. [3,4,6] It should be noted
that the risk of stent encrustation is proportional to ind￾welling time and hence this risk factor is of particular
importance. [4]
Our patient retained his forgotten ureteral stent for 10
years following his renal transplant, despite regular fol￾low-up. This to the best of our knowledge is the longest
documented time period for a forgotten ureteric stent in a
transplantation patient. He had comfortably and unwit￾tingly tolerated it until the development of irritative blad￾der symptoms, which led to him seeking medical help,
and the subsequent discovery of the stent.
Challacombe et al, [7] conducted a retrospective analysis
of 2085 renal transplants. 21 of the 2085 developed uro￾lithiasis. Of note, 1 developed renal calculi after failure of
removal of a stent. The overall range of presentation
included pain, haematuria, oliguria/anuria, sepsis, and
renal failure.
Singh et al, presented a retrospective analysis of 19 forgot￾ten indwelling ureteric stents. [8] Renal transplantation
was the indication for stenting in only one case. Overall,
presentation at time of diagnosis included 7/19 with irri￾tative bladder symptoms. Haematuria, recurrent UTI,
stone formation, loin pain, renal failure and infected
hydronephrosis made up the remaining 12 cases. The
renal transplant patient with a forgotten stent of 1 year
presented with recurrent UTI and intermittent haematu￾ria. Within this case series is also a patient with a solitary
functioning kidney stented for 10 years for mid-ureteric
stone. This patient presented with advanced renal failure
and hyperkalaemia, refused treatment and subsequently
died.
An encrusted, retained stent presents a significant urolog￾ical challenge and many previous studies have not only
acknowledged the associated risk of morbity but also the
necessity of a multimodal endourological approach. [2,9-
14]
These modalities include Extracorporal Shockwave Lithot￾ripsy (ESWL), Ureteroscopy +/- intracorporal retrieval
(URS), and Percutaneous Nephrolithotmy (PCNL). Cur￾rently no guidelines exist for the effective management of
forgotten stents. Previous reports recommend that size of
stone burden and site of encrustation determine the spe￾cific endourologic approach, and that the distal ureteral
segment should be treated prior to any other part of the
stent. [11,13]
With particular reference to the use of PCNL, Lam and
Gupta [13], suggested this should be reserved for a large
proximal stone burden or when ESWL had failed to man￾age the proximal stent encrustations. Bultitude et al, con￾sidered ureteroscopic intervention with adjunctive ESWL
to be efficacious with PCNL as a secondary treatment. [12]
Aravantinos et al, identified that even with successful
stone fragmentation at the proximal end of the stent using
ESWL, intraluminal encrustations can limit straightening
and therefore prevent uncoiling of the calcified proximal
curl. [2] Thus a supplementary intervention is required. In
addition if it is difficult to pass a ureteroscope into the ure￾ter, which already contains an encrusted stent, PCNL is a
reasonable approach.
Once the distal end of the stent is cleared of stone burden
using a ureteroscopic approach, management of a stone
covered encrusted proximal stent using PCNL is reasona￾ble. Though a more invasive technique, it necessitates
fewer subsequent interventions, allowing for fragment
retrieval and stent and stone clearance at the same time
(an all-in-one method). [9] In addition, a nephrostomy
tube can be placed guaranteeing adequate drainage, ena￾bling postoperative imaging exploration, and avoiding
ureteral restenting. [2]
A particular concern with the immunosuppressed trans￾plant patient is the risk of sepsis secondary to bacteraemia
as a result of endoscopic manipulation of colonised stents
and stones. This can arise despite sterile urinary cultures
and can be devastating in compromised patients. [9] The
advice of a microbiologist regarding prophylactic meas￾ures is invaluable, though any risk of sepsis must be com￾municated to the patient adequately for the purposes of
consent prior to the procedure.
Conclusion
The forgotten ureteric stent can cause considerable mor￾bidity to patients and pose challenging urological prob￾lems. The stakes are far greater when a single functioning
kidney is at risk in an immunosuppressed patient. This
case demonstrates that a multimodal endourological and
percutaneous technique can safely remove a heavily
encrusted stent. Specialist microbiological advice for anti￾biotic prophylaxis to prevent sepsis in an immunosup￾pressed patient is advocated. The use of a stent registry and
patient notification card has been widely recommended
to prevent this situation from arising. [14] Certainly the
importance of regular follow up and clear patient educa￾tion as well as good communication between the trans￾plant surgeons and nephrologists must be emphasized to
prevent serious complications.
