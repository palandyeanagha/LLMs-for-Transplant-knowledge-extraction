Abstract


OBJECTIVES: Immunological abnormalities in idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) include an increase in soluble interleukin
(IL)-2 receptor, disease specific cardiac autoantibodies, an HLA-DR4
association, and familial aggregation of disease; however, cytokine
profiles have not been defined. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4,
IL-10, and IL-12 were measured in patients with DCM (WHO
criteria), relatives with asymptomatic left ventricular enlargement
(LVE), patients with ischaemic heart failure (IHD), and healthy
controls. DESIGN: Serum from 20 individuals from each of the four
groups was assayed for cytokine concentrations by a commercial
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IL-2 concentrations
were abnormally increased in DCM patients and relatives with LVE.
Concentrations of IL-10 were increased in DCM patients.
Concentrations of IL-4 and IL-12 were not increased in any of the
groups. CONCLUSION: These abnormalities may reflect defective/
inappropriate T cell function in patients with DCM and in their
relatives with LVE.
