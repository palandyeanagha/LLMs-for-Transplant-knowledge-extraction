Abstract
Introduction: Anesthetic care in patients undergoing thoracic surgery presents specific challenges that require a
multidisciplinary approach to management. There remains a need for standardized, evidence-based, continuously
updated guidelines for perioperative care in these patients.
Methods: A multidisciplinary expert group, the Perioperative Anesthesia in Thoracic Surgery (PACTS) group, was
established to develop recommendations for anesthesia practice in patients undergoing elective lung resection for
lung cancer. The project addressed three key areas: preoperative patient assessment and preparation, intraoperative
management (surgical and anesthesiologic care), and postoperative care and discharge. A series of clinical
questions was developed, and literature searches were performed to inform discussions around these areas, leading
to the development of 69 recommendations. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were
graded using the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Results: Recommendations for intraoperative care focus on airway management, and monitoring of vital signs,
hemodynamics, blood gases, neuromuscular blockade, and depth of anesthesia. Recommendations for
postoperative care focus on the provision of multimodal analgesia, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and specific
measures such as chest drainage, mobilization, noninvasive ventilation, and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.
Conclusions: These recommendations should help clinicians to improve intraoperative and postoperative
management, and thereby achieve better postoperative outcomes in thoracic surgery patients. Further refinement
of the recommendations can be anticipated as the literature continues to evolve.

Introduction
Thoracic surgery requires an evidence-based multidis￾ciplinary approach that extends across the perioperative
period, from preadmission evaluation to postoperative
care and discharge. Although such perioperative care
protocols, known as the enhanced recovery after surgery
(ERAS®
) “philosophy,” have been developed in many
surgical settings, including lung surgery (Batchelor et al.
2019), and have been shown to be effective in reducing
postoperative complications and length of hospital stay
(LOS) (Nicholson et al. 2014), systematic reviews of
studies in thoracic surgery (Cerfolio et al. 2001a; Das￾Neves-Pereira et al. 2009; Muehling et al. 2008; Salati
et al. 2012) have highlighted significant heterogeneity
and methodological flaws in many trials (Fiore Jr et al.
2016; Li et al. 2017). To address this, an Italian expert
group, the Perioperative Anesthesia Care in Thoracic
Surgery (PACTS) group, was convened to develop
evidence-based recommendations for the management
of thoracic surgery patients.
Methods
The PACTS group is a joint task force of the Italian Soci￾ety of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive
Care (Società Italiana di Anestesia Analgesia Rianimazione
e Terapia Intensiva, SIAARTI), The Italian Society of
Thoracic Surgery (Società Italiana di Chirurgia Toracica,
SICT), The Italian Society of Thoracic Endoscopy (Società
Italiana di Endoscopia Toracica, SIET), The Italian Society
of Surgery (Società Italiana di Chirurgia, SIC), The Italian
Association of Hospital Pulmonologists (Associazione
Italiana Pneuomologi Ospedalieri, AIPO), The Italian
Society of Pneumology (Società Italiana di Pneumologia,
SIP/IRS), and the VATS Group. The group comprises
anesthetists, pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, a clinical
epidemiologist, and management staff.
The methods used to develop the PACTS recommenda￾tions have been described in full in an accompanying paper.
In brief, the project focused on preoperative patient assess￾ment and preparation, intraoperative management (surgical
and anesthesiologic), and postoperative procedures and
discharge in adult patients undergoing elective lung resec￾tion for lung cancer. A series of clinical questions were
framed using the PICO (patients, intervention, comparison,
outcome) approach, and a Delphi consensus method was
used to reach agreement based on comprehensive literature
searches. The quality of evidence and strength of recom￾mendations were graded according to the United States
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria (United
States Preventive Services Task Force 2019); in addition,
the panel classified as “Best Practice” the Recommendations
considered to have a high level of certainty despite a lack of
direct evidence. For USPSTF grade A, B, or C recommen￾dations, consensus required > 70% A/B/C ratings with <
15% D/I ratings. For grade D or I recommendations, con￾sensus required > 70% D/I ratings and < 15% A/B/C ratings.
The USPSTF system was used in preference to the GRADE
system, which has been used in the ERAS lung surgery
guidelines (Batchelor et al. 2019), because the intention was
to produce a position statement rather than full practice
guidelines. The GRADE system involves full appraisal of a
limited number of PICO questions, and is therefore time￾and resource-consuming. It is not always feasible where a
number of recommendations are required in fields where
no large evidence base exists, or which cannot easily be
addressed using a PICO framework.
Each author approved the final version prior to sub￾mission. This paper summarizes the final recommenda￾tions for intraoperative and postoperative care (Table 1),
and the supporting evidence for each recommendation.
The recommendations for preadmission and preopera￾tive care are presented in the accompanying paper.
Intraoperative care
Airway management
Recommendation 1: The use of videolaryngoscopy for
tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tube might im￾prove visualization of the glottis and the success rate at
the first attempt, reducing difficulty and positioning
time. Videolaryngoscopy can be used in cases of unex￾pected difficult intubation.
Level of evidence: Poor

Intraoperative care
The use of videolaryngoscopy for tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tube might improve
visualization of the glottis and the success rate at the first attempt, reducing difficulty and
positioning time. Videolaryngoscopy can be used in cases of unexpected difficult intubation.
Poor C
We recommend the use of a double-lumen tube to manage one-lung ventilation. A single
lumen tube with a bronchial blocker, rather than a double-lumen tube, is recommended for
patients with difficult airways.
Good A
We recommend the use of a flexible bronchoscope to control the position of the lung isolation
device. Flexible bronchoscopy must always be available, even if not used routinely. Thoracic
anesthesiologists must have adequate bronchoscopy skills to manage DLT and bronchial
blockers for one-lung ventilation.
Good A
We recommend monitoring arterial blood pressure with invasive (intra-arterial) techniques,
rather than the non-invasive oscillometric cuff technique, in patients undergoing major thoracic
surgery, or when sudden changes in hemodynamics, hemoglobin and blood gas concentrations
(oxygen and carbon dioxide) are expected.
Good A
We suggest considering the use of a central venous catheter on a case-by-case basis in patients
undergoing thoracic surgery. Peripheral catheters are safe for short-term and low-dose treatment
with inotropic vasoactive drugs.
Fair C
In patients undergoing thoracic surgery who are considered at higher risk of postoperative
complications, we suggest the use of hemodynamic monitoring with cardiac output estimation
systems.
Poor C
We do not recommend the use of dynamic preload indices during open-chest thoracic surgery,
because these parameters might not be reliable.
Good D
We suggest that patients undergoing thoracic surgery under general anesthesia are monitored
with processed electroencephalography (pEEG) in order to titrate anesthetic administration.
Fair B
We recommend that intraoperative temperature be monitored using an appropriate system in all
patients undergoing thoracic surgery lasting more than 30 minutes. A core temperature of at
least 36 °C should be maintained.
Good A
We recommend monitoring neuromuscular blockade in all patients receiving neuromuscular
blocking agents during general anesthesia for thoracic surgery.
Good A
In low risk patients (simple procedures, younger patients and without cardiac or renal
comorbidities), the use of a bladder catheter is not recommended.
Fair D
We recommend using balanced crystalloid solutions, rather than normal saline (NaCl 0.9%), as
standard fluid of choice.
Good A
We do not recommend the use of hydroxyethyl starch as routine fluid therapy in patients
undergoing thoracic surgery.
Good D
We recommend a near-zero, rather than restricted or permissive, fluid balance to patients
undergoing thoracic surgery. In high-risk patients a goal-directed approach to fluid therapy
should be applied.
Fair A
We suggest using serum hemoglobin concentration in the evaluation of volume status in non￾bleeding patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Poor C
We recommend a protective ventilation approach during one-lung ventilation, based on the
combination of low tidal volumes (≤ 6 mL/kg ideal body weight) with alveolar recruitment
maneuvers, adequately titrated positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the lowest fraction of
inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain satisfactory arterial oxygen saturation.
Fair A
Volatile anesthesia cannot be recommended over intravenous propofol administration in order
to reduce postoperative complications, although there is evidence of a lower degree of both
systemic and local inflammation when volatile anesthetics are used.
Good I
We recommend the use of a steroid neuromuscular blocking agent because of the availability of
sugammadex, a reversal agent that, unlike acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, can be used even in
cases of deep residual block, and reduces both extubation time and adverse events (bradycardia,
postoperative nausea and vomiting and postoperative residual paralysis).
Fair A
We recommend evaluation of the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the use of
appropriate prophylaxis according to the level of risk, in all patients undergoing lung surgery.
Good A
We recommend avoiding the routine placement of a nasogastric tube, and early removal in
patients in whom a nasogastric tube is used.

Strength of
recommendationa
We recommend the early removal of urinary catheters to promote mobilization in patients
undergoing lung surgery, including those receiving thoracic epidural catheters.
Fair A
Postoperative care
We recommend the use of pre-emptive locoregional analgesia as part of a multimodal analgesic
approach for thoracic surgery. Systemic opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
paracetamol have shown no evidence of benefit when used as pre-emptive analgesics.
Fair A
Currently, there are no elements to suggest the routine perioperative use of gabapentinoids in
patients undergoing thoracic surgery, but their use can be effective in a comprehensive
multimodal analgesia protocol.
Poor I
We suggest intraoperative intravenous administration of ketamine to reduce postoperative pain
after thoracic surgery. There is no evidence about the best dose and timing of administration of
ketamine.
Fair B
We suggest intraoperative intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate to reduce
postoperative pain after thoracic surgery.
Fair B
There is no evidence to suggest the routine use of α2-agonists as part of a multimodal analgesia
regimen to reduce postoperative pain after thoracic surgery. There is no consensus on the best
timing and schedule for administration of these drugs.
Fair I
We suggest considering the use of intravenous steroids as part of a multimodal approach to
reduce peripheral sensibilization of inflammatory-induced pain in patients undergoing thoracic
surgery. Adverse effects of single doses of steroids are of trivial clinical impact.
Fair C
We recommend the use of intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce
peripheral sensitization to inflammation-induced pain in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Combined use of NSAIDs and paracetamol may give a further analgesic advantage.
Good A
We recommend the use of locoregional anesthesia for intraoperative and postoperative pain
management.
Poor A
We recommend the use of thoracic epidural analgesia in high-risk patients or in major surgical
procedures where the parietal pleura (eg chest wall resection) is violated (i.e. thoracotomy,
thoracosternotomy, chest wall resection).
Fair A
We recommend thoracic paravertebral block for VATS, as part of a multimodal approach. Good A
We recommend paravertebral block in preference to thoracic epidural analgesia in patients with
known or suspected coagulopathy.
Fair A
We suggest that intercostal nerve blockade should be considered only as a second choice for
analgesia after thoracic surgical procedures.
Good C
We suggest erector spinae plane block as part of a multimodal analgesia for thoracic surgery,
especially for VATS.
Poor B
We suggest the use of fascial pain blocks as part of multimodal analgesia for thoracic surgery,
particularly for VATS.
Fair B
We suggest considering the use of adjuvants (i.e. opioids, clonidine, dexmedetomidineb
,
dexamethasone, magnesium) when loco-regional anesthesia is performed, because the use of
adjuvants can potentiate and prolong the effect of local anesthetics.
Poor C
We suggest considering the use of a single large-bore chest tube instead of a double tube after
thoracic surgery. Insertion of more than one chest tube may be considered in selected cases
(e.g., bi-lobectomy or bleeding patients).
Poor C
We suggest considering the use of digital chest drainage systems to promote early mobilization
of the patient.
Fair B
The routine use of drainage with suction is not recommended in the absence of complications,
provided there is full re-expansion of the residual parenchyma after lung resection.
Good D
We suggest removing chest tubes in lung resection patients when liquid output is ≤ 5 cm3
/kg/
24 h of serous fluid.
Poor B
We do not recommend systematic ICU admission after thoracic surgery. Poor D
We recommend that, in adult patients undergoing thoracic surgery, oral intake,
including clear liquids, can be initiated 4-6 hours after surgery, in the absence of nausea and
vomiting. Oral intake should, however, be adapted to individual tolerance.
Fair A
We recommend early mobilization of patients within the first 24 h after both minor and major Fair A

Strength of recommendation: C
Several studies have compared videolaryngoscopy with
the Macintosh blade laryngoscope for tracheal intubation,
in order to determine whether videolaryngoscopy improves
the speed and success of double-lumen tube (DLT)
positioning and reduces malpositioning rates (El-Tahan
et al. 2018; Hamp et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2012; Purugganan
et al. 2012; Russell et al. 2013; Wasem et al. 2013). These
studies have yielded conflicting results: while some authors
have reported that videolaryngoscopy is superior to the
Macintosh laryngoscope blade in terms of ease of use and
higher rates of correct positioning of the DLT (Lin et al.
2012; Purugganan et al. 2012), others have found no
significant differences between the two techniques in terms
of time to intubation and hemodynamic stress response
(Hamp et al. 2015; Russell et al. 2013; Wasem et al. 2013).
There are limited data to suggest that videolaryngoscopy
may improve visualization of the glottis, resulting in higher
success rates at the first attempt, and reduced difficulty
and positioning time (Lin et al. 2012; Purugganan et al.
2012). However, the success rate is highly dependent on
the operator’s experience (El-Tahan et al. 2018).
Recommendation 2: We recommend the use of a
double-lumen tube to manage one-lung ventilation. A
single lumen tube with a bronchial blocker, rather than
a double-lumen tube, is recommended for patients with
difficult airways.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
Lung isolation techniques are designed to facilitate
surgical exposure of the lung and achieve one-lung ven￾tilation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery (Campos
and Kernstine 2003; Narayanaswamy et al. 2009). These
techniques use either a DLT with both an endotracheal
and an endobronchial lumen, or a bronchial blocker
inside a single-lumen endotracheal tube, which allows
collapse of the lung distal to the site of occlusion. DLTs
offer a number of advantages over bronchial blockers,
including faster and easier positioning (Campos and
Kernstine 2003; Narayanaswamy et al. 2009; Clayton￾Smith et al. 2015; Dumans-Nizard et al. 2009; Ruetzler
et al. 2011), and a lower likelihood of displacement re￾quiring repositioning under bronchoscopy (Campos and
Kernstine 2003; Narayanaswamy et al. 2009). In addition,
pulmonary collapse can be achieved more quickly with
DLTs, because bronchial blockers do not allow ad￾equate suction to cause lung collapse (Campos 2002;
Yoo et al. 2014). DLTs also ensure pulmonary isolation,
protecting the contralateral lung from blood or infec￾tions (Santana-Cabrera et al. 2010), although the inci￾dence of trauma during intubation is comparable with
the two types of device (Clayton-Smith et al. 2015;
Knoll et al. 2006). For these reasons, SIAARTI guide￾lines recommend DLTs for routine clinical use (Merli
et al. 2009). The decision to use a bronchial blocker, ra￾ther than a DLT, in an individual patient should be
based on the specific clinical circumstances (Merli et al.
2009; Campos 2007).
Recommendation 3: We recommend the use of a flexible
bronchoscope to control the position of the lung isolation
device. Flexible bronchoscopy must always be available,
even if not used routinely. Thoracic anesthesiologists must
have adequate bronchoscopy skills to manage DLT and
bronchial blockers for one-lung ventilation.

We recommend a physiotherapy program after thoracic surgery. Fair A
We suggest considering daily chest radiographs only in selected cases under specific clinical
indications.
Good C
We do not recommend the routine use of either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or
non invasive ventilation (NIV) to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications, prolonged
length of stay, and mortality (both in ICU and in hospital) in patients undergoing major thoracic
surgery. CPAP or NIV could be considered case by case in selected high risk patients.
Poor D
We suggest the use of NIV or CPAP to treat acute respiratory failure complicating thoracic surgery. Poor B
We suggest considering the use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) as an alternative or
integrative support to CPAP or NIV to prevent or treat acute respiratory failure complicating
thoracic surgery.

For prophylaxis and management of atrial fibrillation after thoracic surgery, we recommend
reference to the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) 2011 Guidelines.

recommended. Studies have shown that flexible bron￾choscopy after auscultatory or tactile confirmation of the
location of the DLT can identify malpositioning in more
than one-third of patients (Klein et al. 1998; de Bellis
et al. 2011), and hence some authors have recommended
that the position of the DLT should routinely be con￾firmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy (Klein et al. 1998; Co￾hen 2004). However, this requires technical expertise in
flexible bronchoscopy, and a detailed knowledge of tracheo￾bronchial anatomy (Cohen 2004; Campos 2009; Solidoro
et al. 2019). It remains unclear whether routine broncho￾scopic confirmation of the position of the DLT is necessary.
Malpositioning of the DLT is a major cause of intraop￾erative hypoxemia: in one case series, 21 of 56 patients
in whom the DLT was positioned too deeply in the left
bronchus developed hypoxemia during one-lung ventila￾tion of the left lung (Brodsky and Lemmens 2003). For
this reason, the position of the DLT must be rechecked
by flexible bronchoscopy after the onset of intraoperative
hypoxemia, with the patient in the lateral decubitus pos￾ition (Brodsky and Lemmens 2003; Inoue et al. 2004).
Obstruction of the left or right upper lobe bronchus is
the most common significant malposition with DLTs
(Slinger 1989), but there is no consensus as to the
optimal position of the DLT. Many malpositions may be
attributable to an inappropriate choice of DLT or
suboptimal positioning technique (Slinger 1989; Fortier
et al. 2001; Seymour and Lynch 2002). To date, no data
have demonstrated the clinical relevance of malposition￾ing to patient outcomes, except in cases of dangerous or
critical malposition, and there is no evidence that
routine confirmation of DLT positioning by flexible
bronchoscopy reduces morbidity after thoracic surgery.
When a left DLT is inserted, the use of tubes with
integrated high-resolution cameras can facilitate correct
positioning and easier one-lung ventilation (Massot
2015; Schuepbach et al. 2015). In one study, the mean
time to successful intubation was significantly shorter
with the VivaSight-DL (ETView Medical Ltd, Misgav,
Israel) than with conventional DLTs (63 s versus 97 s,
respectively, P = 0.03), and all VivaSight-DL tubes were
correctly positioned (Schuepbach et al. 2015).
Furthermore, compared with blind placement, the use of
tubes with integrated high-resolution cameras can
shorten the intubation time and permits continued mon￾itoring of the carina, thereby allowing prompt manage￾ment of intraoperative tube displacement (Massot 2015;
Schuepbach et al. 2015; Belze et al. 2017; Chen et al.
2017; Heir et al. 2014).
Patient monitoring
Recommendation 4: We recommend monitoring arterial
blood pressure with invasive (intra-arterial) techniques,
rather than the non-invasive oscillometric cuff
technique, in patients undergoing major thoracic sur￾gery, or when sudden changes in hemodynamics,
hemoglobin and blood gas concentrations (oxygen and
carbon dioxide) are expected.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
Limited data suggest good concordance between inva￾sive and non-invasive arterial pressure measurements in
patients undergoing major thoracic surgery (Bardoczky
et al. 1992; D'Antini et al. 2016; Martina et al. 2012), but
further studies are needed in this area. Due to the possi￾bility of rapid changes in stroke volume and arterial
blood pressure, and the potential usefulness of arterial
blood sampling for gas, hemoglobin, and electrolyte ana￾lysis, invasive (intra-arterial) monitoring of arterial blood
pressure is recommended in patients undergoing major
thoracic surgery. In general, the risk of significant blood
loss is very low in patients with no history of radiother￾apy or chemotherapy who are undergoing primary lung
surgery. For patients undergoing minor resections, the
use of invasive blood pressure monitoring should be
considered on a case-by-case basis according to the pa￾tient’s comorbidity and surgical complexity.
Although specific studies on thoracic surgery pa￾tients are lacking, studies in mixed surgical popula￾tions have demonstrated that even short periods of
hypotension significantly increase postoperative
complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI),
myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS),
and death (van Waes et al. 2016; Walsh et al. 2013;
Sessler et al. 2019). In a review of data from 33,330
patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, the relative
risks of both AKI and MINS increased progressively with
increasing duration of hypotension (mean arterial pressure
< 55 mmHg), compared with patients with mean arterial
pressure above this threshold, even when the duration of
hypotension was only 1–5 min (Walsh et al. 2013). A
mean arterial pressure threshold of 65 mmHg, or 60–70
mmHg with a systolic arterial pressure of 100 mmHg, has
been identified as critical to reduce the occurrence of AKI,
MINS and mortality (Sessler et al. 2019; Salmasi et al.
2017).
Recommendation 5: We suggest considering the use of
a central venous catheter on a case-by-case basis in pa￾tients undergoing thoracic surgery. Peripheral catheters
are safe for short-term and low-dose treatment with ino￾tropic vasoactive drugs.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: C
There is no evidence that central venous catheters are
essential for the intraoperative and postoperative man￾agement of thoracic surgery patients. Measurement of
central venous pressure to predict the response to vol￾ume expansion may be inconclusive in a significant
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 6 of 26

proportion of patients (Cannesson et al. 2011). Further￾more, several studies have shown that low doses of
vasoactive medications can be safely administered via
peripheral intravenous catheters, with extravasation
rates of approximately 2–4% (Cardenas-Garcia et al.
2015; Lewis et al. 2019; Medlej et al. 2018). For these
reasons, the routine use of central venous catheters is
not recommended in patients undergoing thoracic sur￾gery: the need for central venous catheterization should
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Recommendation 6: In patients undergoing thoracic
surgery who are considered at higher risk of postopera￾tive complications, we suggest the use of hemodynamic
monitoring with cardiac output estimation systems.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: C
There is evidence that hemodynamic monitoring using
cardiac output estimation systems to inform goal-directed
fluid management is beneficial in thoracic surgery patients
at higher risk of postoperative complications (Cecconi et al.
2013; Kaufmann et al. 2017; Michard et al. 2017; Searl and
Perrino 2012; Zhang et al. 2013). Furthermore, such moni￾toring can be useful to avoid hypoxemia during one-lung
ventilation, because extreme increases or decreases in
cardiac output can impair the hypoxic pulmonary vasocon￾striction (Lumb and Slinger 2015). The use of this approach
should be based on the estimated risk of complications in
the individual patient.
Recommendation 7: We do not recommend the use of
dynamic preload indices during open-chest thoracic sur￾gery, because these parameters might not be reliable.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: D
A recent meta-analysis of seven trials has found that
pulse pressure and stroke volume are inaccurate predic￾tors of fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing open
thoracotomy (Piccioni et al. 2017), and a subsequent
study has shown that this is also true in patients under￾going VATS procedures (Jeong et al. 2017).
Recommendation 8: We suggest that patients undergoing
thoracic surgery under general anesthesia are monitored
with processed electroencephalography (pEEG) in order to
titrate anesthetic administration.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: B
Processed electroencephalography (pEEG) based on bis￾pectral index (BIS) reduces recovery times (Punjasawadwong
et al. 2014; Chiang et al. 2018). However, the impact of
pEEG on the risk of intraoperative awareness is unclear
(Punjasawadwong et al. 2014). Postoperative delirium occurs
in approximately 14% of patients (Berian et al. 2018), and it
is believed that monitoring the depth of anesthesia by pEEG
is associated with reductions in the incidence of postopera￾tive delirium and cognitive dysfunction (POCD) (Aldecoa
et al. 2017; Fritz et al. 2016). A recent meta-analysis of six
randomized controlled trials showed moderate-quality evi￾dence that pEEG-guided anesthesia could reduce the risk of
postoperative delirium and POCD (Punjasawadwong et al.
2018). Conversely, the ENGAGES study, a RCT of 1232
patients undergoing major surgery under volatile general
anesthesia, did not find any decrease in the incidence of
postoperative delirium among patients managed with
pEEG, compared with usual care (Wildes et al. 2019).
pEEG has been included in guidelines for the prevention
of postoperative delirium from a number of organizations
(Aldecoa et al. 2017; J Am Coll Surg 2015; Gelb et al.
2018). Advanced pEEG technology is considered useful to
improve anesthesia monitoring, individual titration of
anesthetics and optimized patient care (Eagleman and
Drover 2018; Fahy and Chau 2018; Montupil et al. 2019).
Recommendation 9: We recommend that intraopera￾tive temperature be monitored using an appropriate sys￾tem in all patients undergoing thoracic surgery lasting
more than 30 min. A core temperature of at least 36 °C
should be maintained.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
Hypothermia occurs in approximately 35–50% of thor￾acic surgery patients because the pleural surface on one
side of the thorax is exposed to dry air during surgery,
leading to evaporative heat loss (Batchelor et al. 2019).
Avoidance of hyperthermia is essential to prevent dele￾terious effects on homeostasis and reduce the risk of a
systemic inflammatory response. Hence, the ERAS
guidelines for thoracic surgery recommend that body
temperature should be continuously monitored to guide
therapy, and that active warming should be continued
postoperatively until the patient’s temperature is greater
than 36 °C (Batchelor et al. 2019).
SIAARTI guidelines recommend that intraoperative
temperature should be monitored in all patients under￾going thoracic surgery lasting more than 30 min, and
that the aim should be to maintain a core temperature
of at least 36 °C (Di Marco and Cannetti 2019). Suitable
monitoring systems include heated servo-controlled
sensors, intra-vascular catheters with thermistor tips, or
rectal or bladder probes, but esophageal probes may be
less accurate (Di Marco and Cannetti 2019). A number
of studies in various surgical settings have found that
zero-heat-flux systems can be used for non-invasive
temperature measurement, and show good agreement
with conventional core temperature measurements (Eshraghi
et al. 2014; Iden et al. 2015; Makinen et al. 2016).
Recommendation 10: We recommend monitoring
neuromuscular blockade in all patients receiving neuro￾muscular blocking agents during general anesthesia for
thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Good
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 7 of 26

Strength of recommendation: A
Neuromuscular blockade should be monitored in all pa￾tients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs)
during general anesthesia for thoracic surgery (Ortega
et al. 2018). Quantitative (objective) neuromuscular moni￾toring is more reliable than subjective and clinical tests to
assess the neuromuscular block level and, more import￾antly, recovery before extubation (Naguib et al. 2018).
Neuromuscular monitoring is essential for correct admin￾istration of both NMBAs and reversal agents.
Recommendation 11: In low-risk patients (simple
procedures, younger patients and without cardiac or
renal comorbidities), the use of a bladder catheter is not
recommended.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: D
There is no evidence that urine output should be
monitored in all patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Anesthesia management
Recommendation 12: We recommend using balanced
crystalloid solutions, rather than normal saline (NaCl
0.9%), as standard fluid of choice.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
Balanced crystalloid solutions differ from normal saline
(NaCl 0.9%) in that they contain anions other than chlor￾ide, such as lactate, acetate, malate, and gluconate, which
act as physiological buffers (Reddy et al. 2016; Vincent
and De Backer 2016). Although specific studies in thoracic
surgery patients are lacking, the available evidence sug￾gests that normal saline is associated with risks of hyper￾chloremia, hyperchloremic acidosis and AKI (Reddy et al.
2016; Zampieri et al. 2016). For example, in a study in
noncritically ill patients, the 30-day incidence of major
renal adverse events in patients receiving balanced crystal￾loids or saline was 4.7% and 5.6%, respectively (odds ratio
[OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–0.95, P =
0.01), although there was no difference in the number of
hospital-free days between the two treatments (Self et al.
2018). In general, most authors recommend that balanced
crystalloids should be used in preference to normal saline
(Reddy et al. 2016; Vincent and De Backer 2016). Admin￾istration of normal saline is indicated only in specific
circumstances, such as metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia,
or severe brain injury requiring normotonic fluid adminis￾tration (Vincent and De Backer 2016).
Recommendation 13: We do not recommend the use
of hydroxyethyl starch as routine fluid therapy in pa￾tients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: D
Patients undergoing lung resection surgery are at risk
of postoperative respiratory failure, which could be
related to the volume of fluid administered during sur￾gery. Hydroxyethyl starches could be administered in
order to reduce the total amount of fluid given during
surgery, but are associated with an increased risk of
renal impairment (Ahn et al. 2016). Hence, the use of
hydroxyethyl starch as routine fluid therapy should be
avoided in patients undergoing thoracic surgery, al￾though it could be considered in patients with severe
hemorrhage who are not responding to crystalloid infu￾sion (De Hert and De Baerdemaeker 2014).
Recommendation 14: We recommend a near-zero,
rather than restricted or permissive, fluid balance to
patients undergoing thoracic surgery. In high-risk pa￾tients, a goal-directed approach to fluid therapy should
be applied.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
There is evidence that a near-zero, rather than restricted
or permissive, fluid balance is beneficial for patients
undergoing thoracic surgery (Searl and Perrino 2012), and
hence this approach is recommended in normovolemic
patients (Chappell et al. 2008; Licker et al. 2016). In high￾risk patients, a goal-directed approach to fluid therapy is
recommended because this has been shown to signifi￾cantly reduce mortality and morbidity, compared with
standard hemodynamic fluid management (Cecconi et al.
2013; Kaufmann et al. 2017; Michard et al. 2017; Zhang
et al. 2013). For example, a recent meta-analysis of 19 tri￾als involving over 2000 patients found that goal-directed
therapy was associated with a significant decrease in post￾operative morbidity, compared with controls (OR 0.46,
95% CI 0.30–0.70, P < 0.001) (Michard et al. 2017). Simi￾larly, a meta-analysis of 32 trials involving approximately
2800 patients found a significant reduction in postopera￾tive mortality with goal-directed therapy, compared with
controls, in patients at highest risk of postoperative com￾plications (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09–0.41, P < 0.0001); there
was also a significant reduction in complication rates (OR
0.45, 95% CI 0.34–0.60, P < 0.00001), which was particu￾larly marked in the highest risk subgroup (OR 0.27, 95%
CI 0.15–0.51, P < 0.0001) (Cecconi et al. 2013).
Recommendation 15: We suggest using serum hemoglobin
concentration in the evaluation of volume status in non￾bleeding patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: C
Because hemoglobin concentrations reflect plasma
volume changes in patients without significant bleeding,
monitoring of hemoglobin levels may play a role in the
evaluation of volume status in patients undergoing thor￾acic surgery (Perel 2017; Otto et al. 2017).
Recommendation 16: We recommend a protective
ventilation approach during one-lung ventilation, based
on the combination of low tidal volumes (≤ 6 mL/kg
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 8 of 26

ideal body weight) with alveolar recruitment maneuvers,
adequately titrated positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) and the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
to maintain satisfactory arterial oxygen saturation.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Although there is an emerging consensus in favor of
protective ventilation during one-lung ventilation (Lohser
and Slinger 2015), relatively few well-designed randomized
trials have compared protective and conventional one￾lung ventilation (Lohser and Slinger 2015; Ahn et al. 2012;
Kim et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2017): most
published studies have involved small patient populations,
or had other methodological limitations. In one of the
largest randomized trials, 100 patients undergoing elective
lobectomy were randomized to receive either protective
ventilation with an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 0.5,
a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, a positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, and pressure-controlled
ventilation, or conventional ventilation with higher FiO2
and tidal volume, zero end-expiratory pressure, and
volume-controlled ventilation (Yang et al. 2011). The inci￾dence of pulmonary dysfunction (defined as PaO2/FiO2 <
300 mmHg, lung infiltration or atelectasis) was signifi￾cantly lower in patients receiving protective ventilation
than in those receiving conventional ventilation (4% ver￾sus 22% respectively, P < 0.05). A further randomized trial,
involving 65 patients undergoing VATS lobectomy, found
no significant difference in postoperative complication
rates between patients receiving either volume-controlled
or pressure-controlled protective ventilation (Zhu et al.
2017). By contrast, a randomized study in 50 patients
found that protective ventilation did not offer any signifi￾cant advantage, compared with conventional ventilation,
in terms of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction (PaO2/
FiO2 < 300 mmHg or radiographic abnormalities) in pa￾tients undergoing VATS (Ahn et al. 2012).
Further evidence supporting the use of protective ven￾tilation in thoracic surgery patients comes from observa￾tional studies (Blank et al. 2016; Okahara et al. 2018). In
a review of data from 1019 thoracic surgery patients
(Blank et al. 2016), there was an inverse relationship
between tidal volume and the incidence of respiratory
complications (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.96); however, a
low (physiologically appropriate) tidal volume had no
protective effect in the absence of an adequate PEEP. A
further study found that FiO2 during one-lung ventilation
was an independent predictor of the risk of postoperative
pulmonary complications: the risk of such complications
increased by 30% for each 0.1 increase in FiO2 (Okahara
et al. 2018).
Two small studies have examined the effect of protective
ventilation on inflammatory responses following one-lung
ventilation. A small randomized study in VATS patients
found that the combination of protective ventilation with a
recruitment maneuver was associated with attenuated in￾flammatory responses, compared with either conventional
ventilation or protective ventilation alone (Kim et al. 2019).
By contrast, a non-randomized study in 28 patients found
no significant difference in local inflammatory cytokine
responses between lung resection patients receiving pro￾tective or conventional ventilation (Fiorelli et al. 2018).
Recommendation 17: Volatile anesthesia cannot be
recommended over intravenous propofol administration
in order to reduce postoperative complications, although
there is evidence of a lower degree of both systemic and
local inflammation when volatile anesthetics are used.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: I
The clinical impact of the choice of anesthetic in thor￾acic surgery patients is unclear because published studies
differ markedly in their design, and have yielded conflict￾ing findings. It has been suggested that only patients with
severe surgical injuries (i.e., those undergoing pneumonec￾tomy) may benefit clinically from the anti-inflammatory
effects of volatile anesthetics (Beck-Schimmer et al. 2016),
but further studies are needed to clarify this.
Several studies have compared the use of volatile haloge￾nated anesthesia and intravenous propofol administration,
most of which have found that volatile anesthetics are
associated with a lower degree of alveolar—and possibly
systemic—inflammatory responses (De Conno et al. 2009;
de la Gala et al. 2017; Potocnik et al. 2014; Schilling et al.
2011; Sun et al. 2015). In a meta-analysis of eight random￾ized controlled trials in patients undergoing one-lung ven￾tilation, volatile anesthetics were associated with significant
decreases, compared with intravenous anesthetics, in alveo￾lar concentrations of inflammatory mediators (Sun et al.
2015). Other studies have shown that, compared with pro￾pofol, the volatile halogenated anesthetics desflurane and
sevoflurane reduce the expression of inflammatory media￾tors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the inflammatory
response of alveolar epithelial cells to one-lung ventilation;
these effects may be attributable to protective effects on
the endothelial glycocalyx (De Conno et al. 2009; de la Gala
et al. 2017; Schilling et al. 2011; Duthie 2013; Schilling
et al. 2007).
In contrast to the consistent evidence for anti￾inflammatory effects of volatile anesthetics, studies of the
effects of volatile or intravenous anesthetics on postopera￾tive complications have yielded conflicting results, possibly
due to differences in study designs and the definition of
postoperative complications. Several studies have shown
lower rates of postoperative pulmonary complications with
volatile anesthetics, compared with propofol, in patients re￾ceiving one-lung ventilation (De Conno et al. 2009; de la
Gala et al. 2017; Potocnik et al. 2014). In the meta-analysis
cited above (Sun et al. 2015), the relative risk of pulmonary
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 9 of 26

complications in patients receiving inhalation anesthetics,
compared with those receiving intravenous anesthetics,
was 0.42 (95% CI 0.23–0.77, P = 0.005), and the mean dur￾ation of hospitalization was approximately 4 days shorter.
However, a recent large, multicenter, randomized trial in￾volving 460 thoracic surgery patients found no significant
difference in complication rates between patients receiving
desflurane or propofol (Beck-Schimmer et al. 2016). The
proportion of patients with major complications was 13.0%
and 16.5%, respectively, during hospitalization (hazard ratio
[HR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.46–1.22; P = 0.24) and 39.6%
and 40.4%, respectively, at 6 months (HR 0.95, 95%
CI 0.71–1.28, P = 0.71). Subgroup analyses suggested
that only patients with severe surgical injuries benefit
from the anti-inflammatory effects of volatile anes￾thetics (Beck-Schimmer et al. 2016).
Recommendation 18: We recommend the use of a
steroid neuromuscular blocking agent because of the
availability of sugammadex, a reversal agent that, unlike
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, can be used even in cases
of deep residual block, and reduces both extubation time
and adverse events (bradycardia, postoperative nausea
and vomiting, and postoperative residual paralysis).
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Deep neuromuscular blockade, with appropriate reversal
prior to extubation, is recommended for patients undergo￾ing thoracic surgery (Umari et al. 2018; Granell et al. 2018;
Végh et al. 2014). Complete reversal of neuromuscular
blockade after surgery is important because it facilitates
ventilator movements and expectoration, thereby decreas￾ing the risk of postoperative respiratory complications
(Végh et al. 2014). The use of a steroid NMBA, such as
rocuronium, with complete reversal, reduces the extubation
time, compared with non-steroidal NMBAs (Carron et al.
2017; Hristovska et al. 2017).
The use of a selective relaxant-binding agent such as
sugammadex is more efficient and safer than neostig￾mine for reversing moderate or deep induced paralysis
(Flockton et al. 2008). In a prospective observational
study involving 3000 patients, the use of neostigmine for
reversal of neuromuscular blockade did not improve
oxygenation at the time of admission to the post￾anesthesia care unit, and was associated with a higher
rate of atelectasis, compared with patients who did not
receive neostigmine (8.8% versus 4.5%, OR 1.67, 95% CI
1.07–2.59) (Sasaki et al. 2014). In addition, high-dose
neostigmine (> 60 μg/kg) was associated with longer
stays in the post-anesthesia unit (mean 176 versus 157
min) and longer postoperative hospitalization (mean 2.9
versus 2.8 days). By contrast, a 2017 Cochrane review
found that patients receiving sugammadex for reversal of
neuromuscular blockade had 40% fewer adverse events
(risk ratio [RR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.49–0.74), including less
postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), bradycardia,
or postoperative residual paralysis, than those receiving
neostigmine (Hristovska et al. 2017). Furthermore,
sugammadex produced faster reversal of neuromuscular
blockade than neostigmine, irrespective of the depth of
blockade (Hristovska et al. 2017).
Recommendation 19: We recommend evaluation of
the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the
use of appropriate prophylaxis according to the level of
risk, in all patients undergoing lung surgery.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
There is a lack of specific data on PONV after thoracic
surgery. Recently, a randomized controlled trial in
patients undergoing VATS procedures showed a lower
incidence of nausea on the day of surgery in patients re￾ceiving preoperative treatment with methylprednisolone,
compared with placebo-treated patients, although there
was no difference between the groups on postoperative
days 1 and 2 (Bjerregaard et al. 2018). The 2014 Society
for Ambulatory Anesthesia Guidelines for the Manage￾ment of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting recommend
preoperative evaluation of PONV risk using validated
scores, such as the simplified Apfel score, and the use of
appropriate prophylaxis (Gan et al. 2014). Strategies to
reduce the risk of PONV suggested in these guidelines
include the use of propofol rather than volatile anes￾thetics, and minimization of intra- and postoperative
opioids. Prophylaxis against PONV is also recommended
in ERAS guidelines (Batchelor et al. 2019; Ljungqvist
and Hubner 2018).
Recommendation 20: We recommend avoiding the
routine placement of a nasogastric tube, and early re￾moval in patients in whom a nasogastric tube is used.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Nasogastric tubes can be used to identify the esopha￾gus, and to reduce gastric distension and risk of aspir￾ation. There are no specific data in the literature on the
use of nasogastric tubes in patients undergoing lung sur￾gery, but several studies have identified perioperative
nasogastric tube use as a risk factor for postoperative
pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery (Miskovic
and Lumb 2017). Guidelines published by the ERAS Society
recommend avoiding routine nasogastric tube placement in
patients undergoing liver and gastric surgery (Melloul et al.
2016; Mortensen et al. 2014), and the removal of nasogastric
tubes before anesthesia reversal following elective colonic
surgery (Gustafsson et al. 2013).
Recommendation 21: We recommend the early re￾moval of urinary catheters to promote mobilization in
patients undergoing lung surgery, including those receiv￾ing thoracic epidural catheters.
Level of evidence: Fair
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 10 of 26

Strength of recommendation: A
Monitoring of urine output to evaluate perioperative
AKI is included in all classification systems for renal dys￾function (Goren and Matot 2015), but a large prospect￾ive observational study found no association between
intraoperative oliguria (urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h) and
postoperative AKI in patients undergoing major noncar￾diac surgery (Kheterpal et al. 2007). Higher rates of urin￾ary retention after early urinary catheter removal (within
24–48 h after surgery), compared with later removal,
have been reported in patients who received epidural
analgesia for pain management after thoracotomy (Allen
et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2014), but other studies have found
no association between early removal and increased
complication rates (Chia et al. 2009; Ladak et al. 2009;
Young et al. 2018). A systematic review recommended
early removal of the urinary catheter, on the first post￾operative day, in order to promote mobilization and re￾duce pain and discomfort (Zaouter and Ouattara 2015).
Early removal of urinary catheters is one of the overall
ERAS items intended to promote mobilization and am￾bulation (Ljungqvist and Hubner 2018). In addition, the
ERAS guidelines for lung surgery strongly recommend
not to routinely use urinary catheterization solely to
monitor urine output in patients with normal kidney
function, but to use a urinary catheter in patients receiv￾ing epidural analgesia (Batchelor et al. 2019).
Postoperative care
Pre-emptive analgesia
Recommendation 22: We recommend the use of pre￾emptive locoregional analgesia as part of a multimodal
analgesic approach for thoracic surgery. Systemic opioids,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and paracetamol
have shown no evidence of benefit when used as pre￾emptive analgesics.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Multiple studies in various surgical settings have
shown that the use of pre-emptive locoregional analgesia
attenuates postoperative pain scores, decreases supple￾mental analgesic requirements, and prolongs the average
time to first use of rescue analgesia (Nosotti et al. 2015;
Ong et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2015). As a result, pre￾emptive locoregional analgesia is recommended as part
of a multimodal analgesic strategy for thoracic surgery
patients. There is currently no evidence to support the
use of one form of analgesia (opioids, nonsteroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], paracetamol, etc) over
another.
Recommendation 23: Currently, there are no elements
to suggest the routine perioperative use of gabapenti￾noids in patients undergoing thoracic surgery, but their
use can be effective in a comprehensive multimodal an￾algesia protocol.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: I
Studies evaluating gabapentin in thoracic surgery
patients are limited, and have yielded conflicting results.
A randomized, active placebo (lorazepam)-controlled,
trial in a mixed surgical cohort found that perioperative
gabapentin administration until the third postoperative
day had no effect on the time to cessation of acute post￾operative pain (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82–1.33, P = 0.73),
but had a moderate effect on the time to opioid cessation
(HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00–1.54, P = 0.05) (Hah et al. 2018).
Two further studies found no benefit of gabapentin treat￾ment, in terms of postoperative pain relief, opioid con￾sumption, and the incidence of chronic pain 3 months
after thoracotomy (Grosen et al. 2014; Kinney et al. 2012);
similarly, a small randomized trial found that gabapentin
had no significant effect, compared with placebo, on the
incidence or severity of post-thoracotomy shoulder pain
(Huot et al. 2008). On the basis of such findings, a 2013
review concluded that there is no evidence to support the
role of a single preoperative oral dose of gabapentin in
reducing pain scores or opioid consumption following
thoracic surgery (Zakkar et al. 2013). More recently, a ran￾domized, placebo-controlled, trial involving 60 patients
concluded that pregabalin administration before thoracot￾omy is effective in reducing postoperative pain, but in this
study pregabalin did not form part of a multimodal anal￾gesic strategy (Sattari et al. 2018).
In contrast to the studies described above, there are
data to support the use of pregabalin or gabapentin as
part of a multimodal analgesic strategy to improve post￾operative pain and reduce opioid consumption (Mishriky
et al. 2015; Tiippana et al. 2007). In a systematic review
of 55 studies in surgical patients, pregabalin was associ￾ated with significant reductions, compared with placebo,
in pain scores and opioid consumption 24 h after sur￾gery; however, it was also associated with significantly
higher rates of sedation, dizziness, and visual distur￾bances (Mishriky et al. 2015). Current guidelines for the
management of postoperative pain issued by the Ameri￾can Society of Anesthesiology recommend the use of
pregabalin and gabapentin as part of a postoperative
multimodal analgesia regimen: this is considered a
strong recommendation with a moderate level of evi￾dence (Chou et al. 2016).
Recommendation 24: We suggest intraoperative intra￾venous administration of ketamine to reduce postopera￾tive pain after thoracic surgery. There is no evidence
about the best dose and timing of administration of
ketamine.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: B
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 11 of 26

A systematic review of 70 randomized controlled trials
including 4701 patients found that the use of intravenous
ketamine for postoperative pain management resulted in
consistent reductions, compared with controls, in opioid
consumption, and increases in the time to first use of an￾algesic (Laskowski et al. 2011). The greatest benefits were
seen in patients undergoing thoracic, upper abdominal or
major orthopedic surgery. Based on such evidence, US
guidelines for the management of postoperative pain rec￾ommend evaluating the use of intravenous ketamine in
multimodal analgesia regimens (Chou et al. 2016). How￾ever, there is currently no evidence to determine the opti￾mal dosage of perioperative ketamine. There is
evidence that a single dose of ketamine may be inad￾equate, and therefore some authors recommend the ad￾ministration of a pre-operative bolus and intraoperative
maintenance dosing (Mishriky et al. 2015; Himmelseher
and Durieux 2005). One randomized controlled trial in
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery has
found that a reduced infusion regimen (0.015 mg/kg/h
infusion following a saline bolus) and a conventional
low-dose regimen (0.25 mg/kg bolus and 0.125 mg/kg/
h infusion for 48 h) were comparable in analgesic effi￾cacy, in terms of postoperative opioid consumption and
rates of hyperalgesia (Bornemann-Cimenti et al. 2016).
Other authors have suggested that ketamine can be
administered in a series of boluses depending on the
duration of the procedure (Bell et al., 2006). Ketamine
should be used with caution in elderly patients.
Recommendation 25: We suggest intraoperative intra￾venous administration of magnesium sulfate to reduce
postoperative pain after thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: B
Magnesium blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) re￾ceptors, which mediate central sensitization to pain and
thus contribute to postoperative pain and hyperalgesia
(Ko et al. 2001; Wilder-Smith et al. 1997). Hence, many
trials have investigated the use of intravenous magne￾sium to reduce postoperative pain (Albrecht et al. 2013).
In a meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials including over
1200 surgical patients, magnesium treatment was
associated with significant improvements, compared
with controls, in pain at rest and on movement, and
with reductions in postoperative opioid consumption
(De Oliveira Jr et al. 2013). A further meta-analysis of 25
trials found that perioperative magnesium administra￾tion reduced opioid consumption, and to a lesser extent
pain scores, during the first 24 h after surgery (Albrecht
et al. 2013). However, other studies have reported that
intravenous magnesium does not reduce postoperative
pain and opioid consumption (Ko et al. 2001; Wilder￾Smith et al. 1997). A study in gynecological surgery pa￾tients suggests that variability in the efficacy of magnesium
may be related to baseline magnesium levels: low pre￾operative magnesium levels were significantly (P < 0.001)
associated with increased postoperative pain (Ulm et al.
2016). Clinical trials have consistently shown that intra￾venous magnesium has a favorable safety profile, even at
high doses (Albrecht et al. 2013; De Oliveira Jr et al. 2013;
Fawcett et al. 1999).
Recommendation 26: There is no evidence to suggest
the routine use of α2-agonists as part of a multimodal
analgesia regimen to reduce postoperative pain after
thoracic surgery. There is no consensus on the best tim￾ing and schedule for administration of these drugs.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: I
A meta-analysis of 30 studies involving almost 1800
surgical patients showed that both dexmedetomidine,
and to a lesser extent clonidine, reduce postoperative
opioid consumption and postoperative nausea, com￾pared with controls (Blaudszun et al. 2012). However,
dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased risk
of postoperative bradycardia, while clonidine increased
the risks of both intraoperative and postoperative
hypotension, although none of these adverse events re￾quired specific interventions, and recovery times were
not prolonged (Blaudszun et al. 2012). Furthermore, in a
RCT involving 10,010 patients undergoing noncardiac
surgery, clonidine was associated with an increased rate
of important hypotension and nonfatal cardiac arrest,
compared with placebo (Devereaux et al. 2014).
Dexmedetomidine is currently approved in Italy only
for sedation, and thus cannot be recommended for anal￾gesic use in Italian settings.
Recommendation 27: We suggest considering the use
of intravenous steroids as part of a multimodal approach
to reduce peripheral sensibilization of inflammatory￾induced pain in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Adverse effects of single doses of steroids are of trivial
clinical impact.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: C
A meta-analysis of 45 studies including almost 5800
patients showed that a single perioperative dose of intra￾venous dexamethasone resulted in significant reductions
in pain scores and opioid use, and was associated with
shorter stays in the post-anesthesia recovery room, com￾pared with placebo or antiemetic treatment (Waldron
et al. 2013). A further meta-analysis of 24 randomized
controlled trials found that preoperative dexamethasone,
at doses > 0.1 mg/kg, had a greater analgesic effect than
perioperative treatment, although there was no differ￾ence in LOS between the two dosing schedules (De Oli￾veira Jr et al. 2011). In a randomized, placebo-controlled
trial in 64 patients undergoing uterine artery embolization,
administration of dexamethasone 1 h before surgery
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 12 of 26

resulted in significant reductions in postoperative concen￾trations of cortisol and inflammatory mediators, and less
pain and severe PONV, compared with placebo (Kim
et al. 2016).
Although long-term glucocorticosteroid treatment is
associated with significant adverse events such as hyper￾glycemia, increased infection risk, bleeding, and recur￾rence of disease in cancer patients, such events do not
appear to be a concern when dexamethasone is used as
part of a multimodal analgesic strategy. Studies have
generally shown few serious adverse events, and no delay
in wound healing, following single perioperative doses of
dexamethasone in surgical patients (De Oliveira Jr et al.
2011; Holte and Kehlet 2002; Snall et al. 2013; Thoren
et al. 2009).
Recommendation 28: We recommend the use of intra￾venous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
to reduce peripheral sensitization to inflammation￾induced pain in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
Combined use of NSAIDs and paracetamol may give a
further analgesic advantage.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
A meta-analysis of 17 trials evaluating the efficacy of
NSAIDs in surgical patients found that these drugs were
effective in reducing a composite endpoint of pain inten￾sity scores, supplemental analgesic consumption, and
time to first analgesic consumption, compared with
controls (effect size 0.39, 95% CI 0.27–0.48) (Ong et al.
2005). However, although preoperative administration
reduced opioid consumption and lengthened the time to
first use of rescue analgesic, it reduced postoperative
pain scores in only six of 12 randomized controlled tri￾als. NSAID treatment has also been reported to reduce
opioid-related adverse events such as PONV (Gan et al.
2004; Maund et al. 2011). There is evidence that the
analgesic effects of NSAIDs on postoperative pain are
potentiated by concomitant administration of paraceta￾mol (Ong et al. 2005).
A number of studies have examined the efficacy and
safety of ketorolac in surgical patients. A meta-analysis
of 27 randomized, double-blind, trials in 2314 patients
undergoing major abdominal surgery, neurosurgery, or
orthopedic surgery showed that ketorolac does not in￾crease clinically significant bleeding, compared with con￾trols (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.61–2.06, P = 0.72); however,
there appeared to be a slight trend toward more bleeding
with higher doses (> 30 mg) (Gobble et al. 2014). These
results suggest that increases in bleeding time observed
with ketorolac are not clinically relevant, and that there
does not appear to be a significant risk of postoperative
bleeding with ketorolac, compared with controls.
Low doses of ketorolac (10 and 15 mg) appear to be
equivalent in analgesic efficacy to ketorolac 30 mg.
Although no studies were identified that directly com￾pared the analgesic efficacy of different doses of ketoro￾lac in thoracic surgery patients, a double-blind,
randomized, controlled trial in patients with moderate
or severe acute pain treated in the emergency depart￾ment found no significant differences in pain score re￾ductions or adverse event profiles between patients
receiving ketorolac 10 mg, 15 mg, or 30 mg (Motov
et al. 2017). These findings are consistent with those of a
prospective, randomized, non-inferiority trial in patients
undergoing spine surgery, which found that ketorolac 30
mg was not superior to 15 mg for postoperative pain
management (Duttchen et al. 2017). Based on such find￾ings, we suggest the use of low doses of intravenous
ketorolac (15 mg 2–3 times a day) for a maximum of 2
days; however, we suggest caution in using ketorolac in
elderly patients (> 65 years). Ketorolac can be also ad￾ministered orally (10 mg 3–4 times a day) for a max￾imum of 5 days.
Locoregional techniques
Recommendation 29: We recommend the use of locore￾gional anesthesia for intraoperative and postoperative
pain management.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: A
Recommendation 30: We recommend the use of thor￾acic epidural analgesia in high-risk patients or in major
surgical procedures where the parietal pleura (e.g., chest
wall resection) is violated (i.e., thoracotomy, thoracoster￾notomy, chest wall resection).
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Recommendation 31: We recommend thoracic para￾vertebral block for VATS, as part of a multimodal
approach.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
Recommendation 32: We recommend thoracic para￾vertebral block in preference to thoracic epidural anal￾gesia in patients with known or suspected coagulopathy.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Multiple clinical trials have shown that, in patients
undergoing open thoracotomy or other major surgical
procedures, thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is superior
to intravenous opioid administration in terms of postop￾erative pain relief, length of hospital stay, and incidence
of postoperative complications (Hazelrigg et al. 2002;
Block et al. 2003; Della Rocca et al. 2002; Meierhenrich
et al. 2011; Wheatley et al. 2001). However, in patients
undergoing VATS procedures, less invasive procedures
such as paravertebral block (TPVB) appear to be at least
as effective as TEA (Kosinski et al. 2016; Steinthorsdottir
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 13 of 26

et al. 2014). There is moderate-quality evidence that
TEA may reduce the risk of developing persistent postop￾erative pain 3–18 months after thoracotomy (Weinstein
et al. 2018).
Clinical trials and meta-analyses have consistently
shown that TEA and TPVB are comparable in efficacy
for the management of postoperative pain in thoracot￾omy patients (Baidya et al. 2014; Ding et al. 2014; Júnior
Ade et al. 2013; Kobayashi et al. 2013; Raveglia et al.
2014; Scarfe et al. 2016; Yamauchi et al. 2017). There is
also clear evidence that TPVB is associated with fewer
intraoperative complications than TEA, with improved
hemodynamic stability and less need for intravenous col￾loid therapy (Pintaric et al. 2011), probably due to uni￾lateral segmental block. Compared with TEA, TPVB is
associated with lower rates of minor postoperative com￾plications such as urinary retention, nausea and vomit￾ing, and hypotension (Baidya et al. 2014; Ding et al.
2014; Raveglia et al. 2014; Scarfe et al. 2016; Biswas et al.
2016; Gulbahar et al. 2010; Yeung et al. 2016), and the
majority of studies have shown no significant differences
in pulmonary function and pulmonary complications be￾tween the two procedures (Ding et al. 2014; Biswas et al.
2016; Blackshaw et al. 2018). Furthermore, some studies
have found that epidural anesthesia may be associated
with serious complications such as epidural hematoma,
epidural abscess, and nerve injury: the risk of these po￾tentially devastating complications may be reduced with
TPVB, particularly in patients with known or suspected
coagulopathy (Davies et al. 2006; Horlocker et al. 2018).
Although data from randomized controlled trials are
lacking, several studies have shown that TPVB is associ￾ated with a low risk of bleeding complications (Naja and
Lönnqvist 2001; Katayama et al. 2012; Okitsu et al.
2017). In some studies, TEA has also been associated
with higher rates of procedural failure, compared with
TPVB (Kosinski et al. 2016; Ding et al. 2014; Gulbahar et al.
2010; Hermanides et al. 2012). There are no studies com￾paring the efficacy and safety of TPVB when performed by
the anesthetist before the beginning of surgery, or by the
surgeon under direct vision at the end of surgery.
Together, the available evidence indicates that TPVB
and TEA provide comparable analgesia in thoracotomy
patients, but TPVB offers advantages in terms of its
technical simplicity and better safety profile. TPVB is
therefore a valid alternative to TEA, particularly in pa￾tients who are not suitable for TEA.
Recommendation 33: We suggest that intercostal
nerve blockade should be considered only as a second
choice for analgesia after thoracic surgical procedures.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: C
Several studies have shown that intercostal nerve block￾ade is not comparable in terms of analgesia to TEA or
TPVB in thoracic surgery patients (Meierhenrich et al.
2011; Joshi et al. 2008; Wurnig et al. 2002). This is at least
partially due to the shorter duration of analgesia achievable
with intercostal nerve blockade (Wurnig et al. 2002; Linden
et al. 2014), although a recent study has shown that this
can be prolonged by a combination of intravenous and
perineural dexamethasone (Maher et al. 2017). As a result,
we suggest that intercostal nerve blockade should be con￾sidered only as a second choice for analgesia after thoracic
surgical procedures, because more effective techniques are
available. Suitable alternatives include TEA and (especially
for VATS) TPVB, and possibly erector spinae plane block￾ade and serratus anterior plane blockade (see below).
Recommendation 34: We suggest erector spinae plane
block as part of a multimodal analgesia for thoracic
surgery, especially for VATS.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: B
Erector spinae plane blockade (ESPB) is a recently
developed fascial block that allows sensory blockade over
both the posterior and anterolateral thorax. It is
relatively safe and simple to administer, because it is
performed in a musculofascial plane away from the
neuraxis, with minimal risk of serious complications
(other than local anesthetic systemic toxicity) (Forero
et al. 2016; Forero et al. 2017). In an initial series of
seven patients with post-thoracotomy pain syndrome,
who underwent ESPB as part of a multimodal analgesia
strategy, all patients experienced immediate pain relief
and four experienced prolonged pain relief for 2 weeks
or longer (Forero et al. 2017). Randomized controlled
trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this
technique in thoracic surgery.
Recommendation 35: We suggest the use of fascial
pain blocks as part of multimodal analgesia for thoracic
surgery, particularly for VATS.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: B
Serratus anterior plane blockade (SPB) provides good
analgesia, comparable to that provided by TEA, for acute
post-thoracotomy pain, while maintaining a more stable
blood pressure (Khalil et al. 2017; Okmen and Okmen
2017). Like ESPB, SPB offers a less invasive approach in
patients with contraindications to more invasive tech￾niques (Park et al. 2018). A recent placebo-controlled
trial has suggested that SPB reduces postoperative pain
and opioid consumption during the first 24 h after
VATS (Kim et al. 2018), but further studies are needed
to confirm the potential of the technique in thoracic sur￾gery (Park et al. 2018; Okmen and Okmen 2018). Never￾theless, we suggest the use of fascial plane blocks as part
of multimodal analgesia for thoracic surgery, particularly
for VATS patients. A recent study, involving 60 patients
undergoing minimally invasive thoracic surgery, has
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 14 of 26

found that ESPB provides superior quality of recovery,
with lower morbidity and better pain control, compared
with SPB (Finnerty et al. 2020).
Recommendation 36: We suggest considering the use
of adjuvants (i.e., opioids, dexamethasone) when loco￾regional anesthesia is performed, because the use of
adjuvants can potentiate and prolong the effect of local
anesthetics.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: C
Low- to moderate-quality evidence suggests that, when
used as an adjuvant to peripheral nerve blockade in
upper limb surgery, both perineural and intravenous
dexamethasone may prolong the duration of sensory
blockade and reduce postoperative pain intensity and
opioid consumption (Pehora et al. 2017). Specific evidence
regarding the use of dexamethasone as an adjuvant in
thoracic anesthesia is not available.
Chest drainage
Recommendation 37: We suggest considering the use of
a single large-bore chest tube instead of a double tube
after thoracic surgery. Insertion of more than one chest
tube may be considered in selected cases (e.g., bi￾lobectomy or bleeding patients).
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: C
A meta-analysis of nine studies, including 918 patients
undergoing pulmonary resection by VATS, found that
approximately 50% of patients did not have a chest tube
inserted. In these patients, postoperative pain scores and
LOS were significantly reduced, compared with patients
who had a chest tube inserted, with no difference in 30-
day morbidity or re-intervention rates between the two
groups (Li et al. 2018). These findings suggest that omit￾ting the chest tube is safe and feasible in selected
patients.
In patients in whom a chest tube is considered neces￾sary, there is consistent evidence that the use of a single
large-bore tube to remove both air and fluid is as effect￾ive as the use of double chest tubes (Filosso et al. 2017;
Zhou et al. 2016). Furthermore, comparative studies and
meta-analyses have shown that, compared with double
chest tubes, the use of a single chest tube is associated
with less pain, decreases in the amount and duration of
drainage, and reduced healthcare costs (Zhou et al.
2016; Okur et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2016).
Recommendation 38: We suggest considering the use
of digital chest drainage systems to promote early
mobilization of the patient.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: B
External pleural suction is commonly used after lung
resection to promote lung expansion and minimize the
duration of air leakage (Lang et al. 2016; Leo et al.
2013). The AirINTrial, which involved 500 lung resec￾tion patients, found that the incidence of prolonged air
leakage (defined as still having a chest drain in place 7
days after surgery) was not significantly different in
patients in whom external suction was used, compared
to those without suction (10% versus 14%, respectively,
P = 0.2), although a trend toward significance favoring
the use of external suction was seen in patients undergo￾ing anatomical resection (9.6% versus 16.8%, P = 0.05)
(Leo et al. 2013). However, a subsequent meta-analysis
of eight randomized, controlled, trials found that, although
the use of suction reduced the incidence of postoperative
pneumothorax, it was associated with significant increases
in LOS, duration of chest tube drainage, and air leak dur￾ation (Lang et al. 2016).
The effect of digital chest drainage systems on out￾comes after pulmonary resection was studied in a trial
including 103 patients who were randomized to either
analog or digital drainage systems (De Waele et al.
2017). The use of digital systems had no significant
effect on pleural fluid formation, but was associated with
a significantly lower incidence of prolonged air leakage,
compared with analog systems (3.8% versus 18%, re￾spectively, P = 0.025). There was also a trend toward a
shorter duration of chest tube drainage with digital sys￾tems, but this did not reach statistical significance. By
contrast, an international randomized trial involving 381
lung resection patients found that, compared with trad￾itional drainage systems, digital drainage systems were
associated with a significantly shorter duration of chest
tube placement, shorter hospital stays, and higher satisfac￾tion scores (Pompili et al. 2014). We suggest using digital
chest drainage systems, rather than traditional water seal
devices, in order to promote early mobilization.
Recommendation 39: The routine use of drainage with
suction is not recommended in the absence of complica￾tions, provided there is full re-expansion of the residual
parenchyma after lung resection.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: D
In a prospective randomized trial involving 254 lung
resection patients with full parenchymal re-expansion,
suction drainage was found to be less effective than non￾suction drainage in terms of time to chest tube removal
(5.6 days versus 4.5 days, respectively, P = 0.0014) and
incidence of prolonged air leakage (5.6% versus 0.7%, P
= 0.032) (Gocyk et al. 2016). However, no-suction drain￾age was associated with a significantly higher incidence
of asymptomatic residual air spaces, compared with
suction drainage (9.4% versus 0.8%, respectively, P =
0.0018). Other studies have found that suction drainage
does not reduce prolonged air leakage or duration of
drainage in patients without complications such as large
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 15 of 26

expiratory leaks (Alphonso et al. 2005; Brunelli et al. 2004;
Cerfolio et al. 2001b; Coughlin et al. 2012; Marshall et al.
2002).
Recommendation 40: We suggest removing chest
tubes in lung resection patients when liquid output is ≤
5 cm3
/kg/24 h of serous fluid.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: B
In a prospective observational study in 88 patients
who underwent posterolateral thoracotomy for lung
resection, early removal of the chest tube resulted in an
statistically significant improvement in static and dy￾namic pain scores, and in better functional respiratory
outcome (Dokhan and Abd Elaziz 2016). The criteria for
chest tube removal in this study were resolution of air
leaks and fluid drainage ≤ 350 mL/day, provided that the
drained fluid was macroscopically non-chylous and non￾hemorrhagic.
Several authors have suggested that a cut-off of 3–5
cm3
/kg of serous liquid is a good option because this is
within the normal physiological range of daily pleural fluid
filtration, and is suitable for early chest drain removal
without increasing complications and re-admission rates
(Brunelli et al. 2011; Mesa-Guzman et al. 2015; Miserocchi
1997). Based on this clinical evidence, we suggest chest
tube removal when fluid output is ≤ 5 cm3
/kg/24 h of
serous liquid.
ICU admission
Recommendation 41: We do not recommend systematic
ICU admission after thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: D
Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in as
many as 15–40% of patients after major thoracic surgery,
and are associated with prolonged LOS, and poor long￾term outcomes (Brunelli et al. 2009; Agostini et al.
2018). Although VATS procedures are associated with a
reduced incidence of postoperative pulmonary complica￾tions, compared with thoracotomy, such complications
still lead to significant short-term morbidity and mortal￾ity in these patients (Agostini et al. 2018). Implementa￾tion of appropriate postoperative medical strategies, and
monitoring and treatment of high-risk patients in dedi￾cated care units, are aimed at improving postoperative
outcomes (Brunelli et al. 2009).
Currently, many centers routinely admit patients to
the ICU after surgery, whereas in others ICU admission
is reserved for patients requiring ventilator support,
emergency treatment of perioperative complications, or
both (Brunelli et al. 2009). Multiple preoperative factors
can influence the likelihood of postoperative admission
to the ICU in patients undergoing lung resection
(Brunelli et al. 2009; Agostini et al. 2018; Ferguson et al.
2009; Brunelli et al. 2008; Brunelli et al. 2005; Cywinski
et al. 2009; Dulu et al. 2006; Keegan et al. 2007; McCall
et al. 2015; Pinheiro et al. 2015). These include open
thoracotomy, rather than VATS (Brunelli et al. 2008;
Dulu et al. 2006; McCall et al. 2015; Pinheiro et al.
2015), more extensive resection (Cywinski et al. 2009),
and impaired preoperative lung function or pulmonary
comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) (Brunelli et al. 2008; Cywinski et al.
2009; Pinheiro et al. 2015). However, there is evidence
that routine admission of thoracic surgery patients to
the ICU does not reduce mortality rates (Brunelli et al.
2005), and may result in inappropriate ICU admission,
increased healthcare costs, delayed mobilization, and
increased risks of nosocomial infections (Brunelli et al.
2009). To date, no studies have compared outcomes in
thoracic surgery patients admitted to ICUs, high de￾pendency units (HDUs), or surgical wards (Brunelli et al.
2009), and there are no data to identify patients who
might benefit from postoperative intensive care, or to
determine the necessary degree of postoperative care for
an individual patient.
For these reasons, we do not recommend systematic
ICU admission after thoracic surgery. We suggest post￾operative admission of high-risk patients to dedicated
care units (HDUs or dedicated thoracic surgical wards).
These facilities may allow ICU admission to be limited
to patients requiring support for organ failure. Identifi￾cation of high-risk patients, and management of their
postoperative course, should be planned according to
the number and type of complications, and the available
resources. ERS/ESTS working group recommendations
(Brunelli et al. 2009) state that lung resection patients
should be managed in a dedicated thoracic surgical ward
or respiratory HDU (Scala et al. 2011) if available, and
that ICU admission should be limited to patients requir￾ing organ support. The appropriateness of this policy,
and its influence on early outcomes, is still controversial.
Recommendation 42: We recommend that, in adult
patients undergoing thoracic surgery, oral intake, includ￾ing clear liquids, can be initiated 4–6 h after surgery, in
the absence of nausea and vomiting. Oral intake should,
however, be adapted to individual tolerance.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Although it has traditionally been believed that enteral
nutrition should not be resumed in postoperative surgical
patients until normal bowel function has been restored,
studies have consistently shown that early resumption of
oral feeding is safe and well tolerated, and is associated
with decreased wound morbidity, fewer septic complica￾tions, and less weight loss, compared with delayed enteral
nutrition (Warren et al. 2011). Hence, early oral feeding
has been endorsed in a number of guidelines in different
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 16 of 26

surgical settings, including the ERAS/ESTS lung surgery
guidelines (Batchelor et al. 2019; Muehling et al. 2008;
Smith et al. 2011; Weimann et al. 2017; Nelson et al. 2016;
Nygren et al. 2013). In patients undergoing lung resection,
early resumption of oral feeding does not depend on the
surgical technique (open versus minimally invasive)
(Batchelor et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2011; Jones et al. 2013).
Hence, we recommend that, in the absence of nausea and
vomiting, oral intake, including clear liquids, can be initi￾ated 4–6 h after surgery in adult patients undergoing
elective pulmonary lobectomy. Oral intake should, how￾ever, be adapted according to the individual patient’s tol￾erance and the type of surgery carried out.
Recommendation 43: We recommend early mobilization
of patients within the first 24 h after both minor and major
thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Recommendation 44: We recommend a physiotherapy
program after thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Fair
Strength of recommendation: A
Delayed mobilization in patients undergoing lung re￾section is predictive of increased postoperative morbidity
and delayed hospital discharge (Das-Neves-Pereira et al.
2009; Rogers et al. 2018), and hence early ambulation
and physiotherapy have been recommended irrespective
of the surgical approach (Nygren et al. 2013). Several
studies have shown that ERAS programs that include
early ambulation are feasible in lung resection patients,
and can improve outcomes (Das-Neves-Pereira et al.
2009; Cywinski et al. 2009; Dulu et al. 2006; Keegan
et al. 2007; McCall et al. 2015; Pinheiro et al. 2015; Scala
et al. 2011; Warren et al. 2011; Nygren et al. 2013; Jones
et al. 2013; Rogers et al. 2018; Dumans-Nizard et al.
2016; Kendall et al. 2017; Martin et al. 2018). There is
evidence from a propensity score matching study in 524
patients that patients undergoing VATS lung resection
require less physiotherapy than those undergoing open
thoracotomy (Agostini et al. 2017).
Recommendation 45: We suggest considering daily
chest radiographs only in selected cases under specific
clinical indications.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: C
Two meta-analyses have concluded that routine chest
radiographs offer no advantage over clinically indicated ra￾diographs in cardiothoracic surgery patients (Sepehripour
et al. 2012; Reeb et al. 2013). In one of these analyses,
pulmonary pathology was detected in 2–40% of routine
chest radiographs, compared with 79% (P = 0.005) of ra￾diographs that were taken only when clinically indicated
(Sepehripour et al. 2012). Furthermore, a prospective com￾parative study in cardiothoracic surgery patients in an
ICU/post-ICU ward showed that the elimination of daily
routine chest radiographs reduced the total number of ra￾diographs per patient per day in the ICU, but had no effect
on chest radiography practice in the post-ICU ward (Mets
et al. 2007). There is also evidence that chest radiographs
are poor predictors of postoperative complications in
patients undergoing lung resection. In a retrospective chart
review of 86 patients undergoing VATS lung resection, the
sensitivity and specificity of chest radiographs for pulmon￾ary complications ranged from 0–100% and 58–97%, re￾spectively, depending on the reviewer, and there was only
slight overall agreement between reviewers (Troquay et al.
2013). For these reasons, we suggest considering daily chest
radiographs only in selected patients. Bedside, lung ultra￾sound may also be useful in some patients (Chiappetta
et al. 2018; Touw et al. 2018).
Recommendation 46: We do not recommend the rou￾tine use of either continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) or non invasive ventilation (NIV) to prevent
postoperative pulmonary complications, prolonged
length of stay, and mortality (both in ICU and in hos￾pital) in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery.
CPAP or NIV could be considered on a case by case
basis in selected high-risk patients.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: D
Postoperative pulmonary complications are the princi￾pal cause of mortality and morbidity after lung resection
(Torres et al. 2019). Acute respiratory failure has been
reported to occur in 2–30% of patients after lung resec￾tion (Lorut et al. 2014), and overall pulmonary complica￾tion rates have been reported to be as high as 49% (Nery
et al. 2012). Because prolonged invasive mechanical
ventilation has been shown to be an important risk
factor for such complications, prophylactic non-invasive
ventilation (NIV) has been proposed as a means of redu￾cing this intubation-related risk (Riviere et al. 2011).
Although NIV offers the potential to improve lung func￾tion, unload respiratory muscles and reduce postoperative
hypoxemia and atelectasis, randomized controlled trials
have not shown consistent evidence that the addition of
either NIV or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
to standard medical therapy offers no significant benefit
(Lorut et al. 2014; Nery et al. 2012; Aguilo et al. 1997;
Barbagallo et al. 2012; Danner et al. 2012; Garutti et al.
2014; Liao et al. 2010; Perrin et al. 2007). In a recent
Cochrane review of eight trials involving a total of 486
patients, there were no significant differences between
patients receiving NIV and control groups in terms of pul￾monary complications (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72–1.47), intub￾ation rates (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.25–1.00), mortality (RR
0.60, 95% CI 0.24–1.53), length of ICU stay (mean differ￾ence − 0.75 days, 95% CI − 3.93–2.43) or length of hospital
stay (mean difference − 0.12 days, 95% CI − 6.15–5.90)
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 17 of 26

(Torres et al. 2019). However, the quality of the evidence
was poor, due to the limited number of studies, hetero￾geneity of the patient populations and of the scheduled
ventilator treatment, small sample sizes, and low frequen￾cies of outcomes (Torres et al. 2019). However, it could be
speculated that selected patients at higher risk of develop￾ing pulmonary complications (e.g., obese patients or pa￾tients with COPD, obese, chronic heart failure, or chronic
hypersecretion) are likely to benefit from the administra￾tion of CPAP or NIV in addition to standard medical and
physiotherapy, consistent with the established use of these
techniques for the prevention of post-extubation failure
(Rochwerg et al. 2017; Scala and Pisani 2018).
Recommendation 47: We suggest the use of NIV or
CPAP to treat acute respiratory failure complicating
thoracic surgery.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: B
One small study (n = 24) in patients with acute hypox￾emic respiratory insufficiency after lung resection found
that the addition of NIV to standard therapy was associ￾ated with significant reductions, compared with controls,
in the need for endotracheal mechanical ventilation
(20.8% versus 50%, respectively, P = 0.035) and 120-day
mortality (12.5% versus 37.5%, P = 0.045); however,
there were no differences in length of ICU and hospital
stays between the two groups (Auriant et al. 2001). On
the basis of these findings, it is suggested that NIV or
CPAP could be used in the management of acute
respiratory insufficiency following thoracic surgery, but
it should be noted that the availability of only a single
study limits the strength of this recommendation.
However, it should be remembered that NIV is associated
with a number of adverse events (e.g., poor compliance,
leaks, sensory dysfunction, hypersecretion, unprotected
airways, patient-ventilator asynchronies) that are likely to
be associated with the need for intubation (Scala and Pisani
2018). Furthermore, NIV failure occurs in approximately
20% of patients, and is associated with increased rates of
nosocomial pneumonia and postoperative mortality (Riviere
et al. 2011). In a prospective study of 664 patients admitted
to the ICU after lung resection or pulmonary thrombendar￾terectomy, four independent risk factors for NIV failure
within the first 48 h were identified: increased respiratory
rate (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.63–10.67), increased Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (OR 3.05, 95% CI
1.12–8.34), number of fiberoptic bronchoscopies performed
(OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.01–2.54), and number of hours on NIV
(OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11) (Riviere et al. 2011). Risk
stratification of candidates for thoracic surgery is likely to
be useful for selecting sub-sets of patients who may benefit
from either prophylactic or therapeutic NIV. These might
include patients with COPD or severely impaired respira￾tory function (Danner et al. 2012; Garutti et al. 2014; Perrin
et al. 2007) and obese patients (Stephan and Berard 2017).
Further research is needed to clarify the potential
usefulness of prophylactic or therapeutic NIV in such
groups, and to determine the most efficacious sched￾uled regimens.
Recommendation 48: We suggest considering the use
of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy as an alterna￾tive or integrative support to CPAP or NIV to prevent
or treat acute respiratory failure complicating thoracic
surgery.
Level of evidence: Poor
Strength of recommendation: C
High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy is
considered to be a non-invasive form of respiratory as￾sistance for spontaneously breathing hypoxemic patients
with early stages of acute respiratory failure. This tech￾nique delivers high inspiratory flow rates (up to 60 L/
min) that match the oxygen demands of ventilated
patients; in addition, HFNC oxygen therapy offers good
comfort, efficient wash-out of the upper airway and
clearance of CO2, provision of adequate humidification,
and reduction of respiratory effort (although this latter
effect is less than can be achieved with NIV) (Stephan
and Berard 2017). A post hoc analysis of a large random￾ized trial in obese patients undergoing major thoracic
surgery investigated the impact of HFNC on rates of
treatment failure, defined as the need for re-intubation
or switching to alternative treatments, or premature dis￾continuation (Stephan and Berard 2017). This analysis
found that HFNC is not inferior to NIV in terms of
treatment failure rates (13.3% versus 15.4%, respectively,
P = 0.62), ICU mortality (2.2% versus 5.9%, P = 0.22),
length of ICU stay (median 5.0 versus 4.0 days, P =
0.63), or length of hospital stay (median 10.0 versus 11.1
days, P = 0.71). However, skin breakdown at 24 h was
significantly more common with NIV than with HFNC
(9.2% versus 1.6%, respectively, P = 0.01).
On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that
HFNC may be considered as an alternative to CPAP or
NIV for the prevention or treatment of acute respiratory
failure complicating thoracic surgery. It should be noted
that the lack of corroborating randomized trials limits
the strength of this recommendation. However, the
demonstration of the effectiveness and acceptability of
HFNC in milder degrees of acute (particularly hypox￾emic) respiratory failure is consistent with the potential
use of HFNC in patients with postoperative pulmonary
complications following major thoracic surgery (Rochwerg
et al. 2019). It should also be noted that the integrated use
of HFNC during times off NIV could be an effective strat￾egy, especially in patients showing poor tolerance to the
NIV interface (Scala and Pisani 2018; Longhini et al. 2019).
Recommendation 49: For prophylaxis and management
of atrial fibrillation after thoracic surgery, we recommend
Piccioni et al. Perioperative Medicine (2020) 9:31 Page 18 of 26

reference to the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) 2011
Guidelines.
Level of evidence: Good
Strength of recommendation: A
Postoperative cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial
fibrillation, occur in approximately 10–20% of patients
undergoing major noncardiac thoracic surgery, including
both thoracotomy and VATS lobectomy (Garner et al.
2017; Onaitis et al. 2010; Park et al. 2007). Potential risk
factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male
gender, hypertension, comorbidities such as COPD or
heart failure, extent of lung resection, and postoperative
infection (Batchelor et al. 2019; Garner et al. 2017; Onaitis
et al. 2010). Postoperative atrial fibrillation can lead to
hemodynamic instability, potentially prolonging ICU and
hospital stay (Frendl et al. 2014). Furthermore, atrial fibril￾lation may persist beyond hospital discharge in a propor￾tion of patients, and some patients may require long-term
anticoagulation (Garner et al. 2017).
It is recommended that the Society of Thoracic Surgery
(STS) 2011 guidelines for the prophylaxis and manage￾ment of atrial fibrillation (Fernando et al. 2011) should be
followed in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy.
These guidelines recommend pharmacological prophy￾laxis with β-blockers or diltiazem: amiodarone is not
recommended for patients undergoing pneumonectomy.
Electrical cardioversion is recommended for patients who
develop hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation, and
for patients with symptomatically intolerable atrial fibrilla￾tion in whom treatment with metoprolol (or diltiazem for
patients with severe COPD), alone or followed by flecai￾nide, is ineffective. Anticoagulation with aspirin (for pa￾tients at low thromboembolic risk), or warfarin or heparin
(for high-risk patients), is recommended for patients with
persistent or recurrent atrial fibrillation after 24 h of
metoprolol treatment (Fernando et al. 2011). It should be
noted, however, that to date no scoring system has been
developed to identify lung resection patients at high risk
of atrial fibrillation, although promising results have been
obtained with the CHADS2 score (Kotova et al. 2017).
Furthermore, there is little evidence that prophylaxis
for atrial fibrillation improves outcomes after thoracic
surgery [1].
Conclusions
Anesthesia in patients undergoing thoracic surgery is a
complex undertaking that requires a multidisciplinary ap￾proach to risk assessment, perioperative monitoring, and
postoperative care. Recognizing this, the PACTS group
has sought to identify critical issues in the preoperative,
intraoperative and postoperative care of patients undergo￾ing lung resection, and to provide appropriate guidance.
Wherever possible, our recommendations are based on
good-quality supporting evidence: where such evidence is
limited, the recommendations are framed as suggestions
or possibilities for consideration. In a few cases, there was
insufficient evidence to make formal recommendations: in
such cases, our guidance is based on expert opinion, sup￾ported by published literature where possible.
Our literature reviews and discussions highlighted the
importance of the choice of anesthetic and lung isolation
procedure, attention to airway management, and com￾prehensive monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamics,
neuromuscular blockade, and depth of anesthesia, for
achieving optimal outcomes. Postoperatively, a multi-modal
analgesic strategy that includes pre-emptive analgesia and
locoregional blockade is required for optimal pain control.
Finally, decisions on ICU care, chest drainage, and other in￾terventions should be individualized for each patient.
The ERAS lung surgery guidelines (Batchelor et al.
2019) were published while our recommendations were
in development. We believe that these recommendations
extend and complement those of the ERAS guidelines
for a number of reasons. First, aspects of anesthesiologic
care such as depth of anesthesia monitoring, neuromus￾cular blockade, and hemodynamic monitoring are
covered in greater detail than in the ERAS guidelines. In
addition, our recommendations focus specifically on
elective surgery for lung cancer.
It is hoped that these recommendations will help to
achieve optimal postoperative outcomes in the greatest
number of thoracic surgery patients. Further refinement
of our recommendations can be anticipated as the litera￾ture continues to evolve.
