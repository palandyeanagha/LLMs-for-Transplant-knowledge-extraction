Background: For over 50 years, surgical septal myectomy has been the preferred treatment for drug￾refractory heart failure symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Over 
this time in the United States, the majority of myectomy operations have been performed in a small number 
of select referral centers. 
Methods: We have taken the opportunity to report results from the relatively new Tufts HCM Center and 
surgical program, incorporated 13 years ago, during which 507 myectomies (52±14 years of age; 56% male) 
were performed by one cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Hassan Rastegar. 
Results: Resting left ventricular (LV) outflow gradients were reduced from 56±42 mmHg preoperatively 
to 1.2±6.8 mmHg on most recent echocardiogram 2.0±2.5 years after surgery, and 94% of patients showed 
clinical improvement to NYHA functional class I or II. The first 200 myectomies were performed without 
mortality or major complications. Among all patients, 30-day mortality rate was 0.8%. Over follow-up of 
3.2±2.8 years, 11 patients died (four due to HCM causes) with long-term survival after myectomy of 94% at 
5 years (95% CI: 89–96%) and 91% at 10 years (95% CI: 84–95%), which did not differ from the age- and 
gender-matched general U.S. population (log-rank P=0.9). 
Conclusions: This experience demonstrates that, with the appropriate support, new HCM surgical 
programs can provide patients successful relief of outflow obstruction, extended longevity and restored of 
quality of life.

Introduction
Left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction is an 
important determinant of clinical course in hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) (1,2), leading to progressive 
heart failure disability or morbidity in many patients. 
For 50 years, surgical septal myectomy (the Morrow 
procedure) (3-7) has been the “gold standard” treatment 
for drug-refractory heart failure symptoms in patients 
with obstructive HCM (8-12). This standard is supported 
by the 2011 U.S./Canada ACC/AHA guidelines (13,14) 
placing myectomy as the preferred intervention for 
abolishing the outflow gradient, and relieving symptoms 
due to elevated LV systolic pressures and associated mitral 
regurgitation (15). 
In North America, septal myectomy has been performed 
largely in select HCM centers-of-excellence with highly 
experienced cardiologists and cardiac surgeons (16-23). In 
this review, we have taken the opportunity to document 
the results of the select HCM surgical program at Tufts 
Medical Center (24).

Methods
Tufts surgical myectomy cohort
Between the inception of the surgical center in October 
2003 and December 2016, 507 patients underwent septal 
myectomy at Tufts Medical Center to relieve severe heart 
failure symptoms (usually equivalent to NYHA functional 
class III–IV) refractory to optimized medical management. 
All patients agreed to undergo surgery and accept its 
inherent risks to relieve their limiting symptoms which 
had become an obstacle to an acceptable quality of life. 
Among the 507 patients meeting inclusion criteria of having 
had septal myectomy at this center in the aforementioned 
time frame, there were 25 with severe aortic stenosis 
requiring concomitant valve replacement that have been 
excluded from the current study sample. The remaining 
482 HCM patients who underwent septal myectomy were 
retrospectively reviewed and comprise the study cohort, 
including 30 patients that required adjunctive coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG). 
To permit a minimum of 12 months follow-up, the 82 
patients operated on during 2016 were excluded from the 
long-term survival analysis. Follow-up after surgery of the 
initial 400 patients was obtained by telephone contact or 
clinic visit, with a mean follow up time of 3.2±2.8 years 
(range to 12.0 years). Of this group, 18 patients (4.5%) have 
been lost to follow-up. 
Cardiac imaging
Left ventricular dimensions
Imaging with 2-dimensional echocardiography and/or 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) showed anterior 
ventricular septal thickness in the potential area of muscular 
resection, measuring 20±5 mm (range, 10–48 mm). In 50 
patients (11%) septal thickness was ≤15 mm and in 22 
patients (5%) was ≥30 mm. LV end-diastolic dimension 
was 41±6 mm (range, 25–72 mm) and left atrial transverse 
dimension was 43±7 mm (range, 23–74 mm). Mitral 
regurgitation was severe in 31 patients (7%), mild to 
moderate in 299 (63%), and absent/trace in 145 (30%). LV 
ejection fraction was ≥50% in all patients (range, 45–80).
Operative procedure
Myectomy
Prior to initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed 
to assess the extent and distribution of ventricular septal 
thickening, inspect mitral valve morphology, the degree 
and direction of mitral regurgitation, and subvalvular 
structures including papillary muscles, as well as provide 
measurements of the LV outflow tract gradient at rest 
and with provocation with intravenous isoproterenol or 
dobutamine. 
After cardiopulmonary bypass was established, a 
transverse aortotomy was created and ventricular muscular 
resection typically began 1 cm below the nadir of the right 
coronary cusp and the commissure between the left and 
right cusps, and was extended distally between these two 
lines down to the mid-ventricle. The degree of muscular 
resection was dependent on the distribution and thickness 
of the basal septum. Any abnormal intraventricular muscle 
bundles or accessory connections to the mitral valve were 
resected. In patients with direct insertion of anomalous 
anterolateral papillary muscle onto anterior mitral leaflet, 
septal myectomy was extended beyond the contact point of 
the papillary muscle and ventricular septum, and adjunctive 
surgical debulking of the papillary muscle was done to 
eliminate potential for mid-ventricular obstruction. 
To ensure complete relief of subaortic obstruction, 80 
patients (17%) required mitral valve plication, effectively 
shortening an elongated anterior mitral leaflet. Mitral 
ring annuloplasty (n=22) or valve replacement (n=1) was 
performed in patients with severe mitral regurgitation 
judged to be caused by intrinsic valve pathology.
After the patient was separated from cardiopulmonary 
bypass, intraoperative TEE at rest and with provocation 
with isoproterenol or dobutamine was done to confirm 
complete relief of obstruction and resolution of mitral 
regurgitation. Indications to resume cardiopulmonary 
bypass and perform additional muscular resection and/
or mitral valve intervention included: residual mitral￾septal contact with gradient >30 mmHg and/or ≥2+ mitral 
regurgitation. 
Cox-Maze procedure
In all patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, the 
Cox-maze IV procedure was carried out. The bilateral 
pulmonary veins were encircled and ablated with a bipolar 
radiofrequency clamp. The left atrial appendage was opened 
and the trabecular segment was removed. Through a left 
atriotomy, bipolar radiofrequency clamps were used to make 
connecting lesions between the right and left pulmonary 
veins (Box lesion). Epicardially, a cryoprobe was placed 
over coronary sinus at P3 of mitral valve to create an ice

ball and a connecting lesion was created between the right 
pulmonary veins, ice ball, and mitral valve annulus. Right 
atrial lesions were placed via a small vertical atriotomy. 
With a bipolar clamp, a lesion was created between the 
superior and inferior vena cavae. Then, with cryoprobe a 
linear lesion was created from upper pole of atriotomy and 
tricuspid annulus. 
Statistical analysis
Continuous and categorical data are expressed as mean (± 
SD) and n (%), respectively. Comparisons of characteristics 
between groups were made with unpaired Student’s t-test, 
one way ANOVA, Chi-square tests, or Fisher’s Exact test 
where appropriate for continuous and categorical data. A P 
value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 
survival analysis model used proportional hazards regression 
methodology and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were 
compared using log-rank statistics. End points were all￾cause mortality and HCM-related mortality. Deaths within 
30 days or during the index hospitalization after myectomy 
were considered operative deaths and are included in both 
end points. The HCM-mortality included sudden cardiac 
death (unexpected within one hour of witnessed collapse 
or nocturnal) or heart failure death (in the context of 
progressive cardiac decompensation).
For comparison with myectomy patients, an expected 
survival curve for the general population was generated 
from U.S. Health Statistics, which incorporate all-cause 
mortality. Each myectomy patient was matched to the U.S. 
white population by age, gender, and year of study entry. 
All analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC).
Results
Demographic and clinical findings
At the time of operation, patients were 52±14 years of age 
(range, 12–82 years), with 42 patients (9%) <30 years and 
151 (31%) >60 years of age; 273 (57%) were male. LV 
outflow gradients of ≥50 mmHg (range to 170 mmHg) were 
present in 282 patients (60%), and in the remaining 200 
patients (40%) was <50 mmHg at rest but ≥50 mmHg with 
physiologic (exercise) provocation (range to 180). 
Heart failure symptoms consistent with NYHA class 
III or IV based on personal functional capacity deficits, 
including exertional dyspnea and/or chest pain during daily 
activities, were present in 473 patients. Nine additional 
patients in class I or II underwent surgery for patient 
preference (n=7), or need for concomitant CABG for severe 
multi-vessel coronary artery disease (n=1), or left atrial 
myxoma resection (n=1) (Table 1). 
Postoperative hemodynamic results
Resting LV outflow gradients were reduced from 56±
42 mmHg preoperatively, to 1.2±7 mmHg on most recent 
echocardiogram 2.0±2.5 years after surgery. In the 31 
patients with preoperative severe mitral regurgitation (3 
or 4+), postoperatively 27 (87%) had no or mild mitral 
regurgitation and four (13%) had residual moderate mitral 
regurgitation, including 22 (71%) who required insertion 
of a mitral valve annular ring and 1 (3%) with mitral valve 
replacement. During follow-up, no patient underwent 
repeat surgical myectomy for persistent or recurrent 
outflow tract gradient. 
Short-term complications and operative mortality 
Of the 482 patients, 4 (0.8%) died within 30 days of surgery 
or during the index hospitalization. These patients were 24, 
50, 71 and 82 years of age and two were male. Causes of 
death were: cardiogenic shock due to low cardiac output in 
two patients, pericardial tamponade and multi-organ failure 
in one patient, and respiratory failure in one patient. 
A total of 43 patients required postoperative implantation 
of a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker for complete 
heart block. Pacemakers were placed in four patients for 
reasons other than complete heart block including second￾degree heart block for two, an asystolic episode for one, and 
symptomatic bradycardia for one. Ninety patients (4.0% 
overall) had complete heart block with no risk markers 
for development of postoperative complete heart block. 
The remaining 24 had predisposing conditions or surgical 
procedures increasing the risk for development of complete 
heart block, including: mild hypertrophy of basal septum 
≤15 mm (n=7); preoperative right bundle branch block (n=5); 
concomitant septal muscular resection at time of subaortic 
membrane removal (n=4); Cox-Maze procedure (n=4); 
aortic valve debridement (n=1); preoperative congenital 
VSD (n=1); myxoma resection (n=1) and resection of crista 
supraventricular muscle to relieve right ventricular outflow 
tract obstruction (n=1).
Iatrogenic VSD occurred in five patients. Maximal 
anterior septal thickness was 16–17 mm in three patients

and 18 and 20 mm in the other two. Intraoperative repair 
with septal patch was required in one patient, while the 
remaining four VSDs were considered not to be of clinical 
significance and were not repaired. Of the five patients 
with VSD, all have remained asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic, and none have required VSD repair during 
the follow-up period. 
Ischemic stroke occurred in four patients in the 
perioperative period, including two patients with acute onset 
upper extremity weakness, one with expressive aphasia, and 
one with a left parietal infarct confirmed on CT obtained 
for altered mental status with no neurologic deficits. None 
of these incidents occurred in the setting of perioperative 
atrial fibrillation. Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred 
in 101 patients (21%), including 14 with preoperative 
atrial fibrillation that underwent COX-Maze procedure 
at the time of septal myectomy. Cardioversion occurred 
spontaneously (n=2) or was achieved with beta-blockade 
(n=3), amiodarone (n=71) or electrical cardioversion 
(n=23). The remaining two were rate-controlled at time of 
discharge.
Long-term outcome 
Of the 396 patients eligible for long-term follow-up, 385 
(96.3%) were alive at most recent follow-up. Of these 247 
(64%) were asymptomatic in NYHA class I, 113 (29%) 
were in class II with mild symptoms, and 25 (7%) had 
persistent limiting class III-IV symptoms (Figure 1). The 
extent of functional improvement was similar in patients 
with preoperative rest obstruction compared to those with 
only exercise-induced gradients [208 (92%) class I–II for 
rest obstruction vs. 141 (95%) class I–II for provocable 
obstruction; P=0.3]. There was also no difference with 
respect to gender [205 (93%) class I–II for males vs. 155 
(94%) class I–II for females; P=0.8] (Table 2). 
Late deaths occurred in 11 patients at 59±15 years of age, 
3.5±1.7 years after myectomy. Three of the deaths were 
due to HCM-related causes: two patients who developed 
end-stage heart failure and systolic dysfunction (who were 
not candidates for heart transplant), and one patient with 
sudden death but without conventional risk factors. The 
eight other deaths were due to non-cardiac etiologies: three 
with multiple co-morbidities, one from cancer, one from 
illicit drug use, and one from mesenteric ischemia. Cause of 
death in two patients is unknown.
Overall long-term survival after myectomy was 98% at 
1 year (95% CI: 96–99%), 94% at 5 years (95% CI: 
89–96%) and 91% at 10 years (95% CI: 84–95%), and 
did not differ from the age- and gender-matched general 
U.S. population (log-rank P=0.9) (Figure 2). HCM-related 
mortality after myectomy was 98% at one year (95% CI: 
96–99%), 97% at 5 years (95% CI: 94–99%) and 97% at 
10 years (95% CI: 94–98%), and was significantly higher 
than the age- and gender-matched general U.S. population 
(log-rank P=0.04) (Figure 3).
Prior alcohol septal ablation 
Twelve patients (3%) had myectomy performed after 
alcohol septal ablation due to recurrent heart failure 
symptoms (NYHA class III) caused by persistent outflow 
tract obstruction. Post-myectomy, none of these 12 patients 
had a significant outflow gradient (≥50 mmHg) on most 
recent echocardiographic evaluation and all improved to 
class I (n=8) or II (n=4) on most recent follow-up. 
Discussion
The HCM Institute and surgical myectomy program at 
Tufts Medical Center is now 13 years old, the largest such 
program in the eastern United States, and the third largest 
in the world. Since its inception, a single cardiothoracic 
surgeon, Dr. Hassan Rastegar, has performed surgical septal 
myectomy on more than 500 severely symptomatic drug￾refractory patients with obstructive HCM to relieve outflow

gradient and reverse heart failure morbidity and mortality. 
Hemodynamic and clinical results and operative 
mortality at Tufts are consistent, in all respects, with the 
experience at other established HCM centers with long￾standing myectomy programs (16-23). For example, LV 
outflow obstruction was essentially obliterated with small 
postoperative gradients at rest of 1.2±6.8 mmHg, operative 
mortality was 0.8%, and 94% of patients showed clinical 
improvement to NYHA functional class I or II due to 
normalization of intraventricular LV pressures and decrease 
in associated mitral regurgitation. In addition, clinical 
improvement following myectomy was comparable among 
patients with rest—compared to provocable-obstruction, 
similar to previous surgical experiences. Therefore, it is 
important to underscore that when performed by a highly 
experienced surgeon, myectomy consistently reverses 
the heart failure process and usually returns patients to 
normal (or near-normal) activity level and quality of life. 
A small subgroup of clinical non-responders to myectomy 
were identified, defined as patients with persistent NYHA 
class III symptoms postoperatively despite surgical relief 
of the outflow gradient. The determinants of this clinical 
course remain incompletely resolved, but may be due to 
the predominant role played by diastolic dysfunction in 
generating symptoms. 
This contemporary surgical series and initiative 
from Tufts Medical Center underscores the important 
transformation of septal myectomy from a highly 
morbid operation (25) to one of the safest open-heart 
procedures, currently with a low operative mortality of 
<1% at experienced centers (16-23). Notably, the operative 
mortality associated with surgical myectomy at Tufts 
Medical Center is significantly lower compared to that of 
a number of other common cardiovascular operations as 
reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, including 
an operative risk 9-fold less than CABG with concomitant 
mitral valve replacement and 2-fold less than isolated aortic 
valve replacement (Figure 4) (26-29).
Furthermore, long-term survival from all-causes 
following myectomy is high (94% at 5 years; 91% at 
10 years), equivalent to that of the general U.S. population. 
It is also reasonable to assume that heart failure would 
have inevitably progressed to death and/or profound 
disability. By virtue of relieving impedance to outflow and 
normalizing LV pressures and mitral regurgitation, these 
data substantiate that myectomy conveys a survival benefit.
In the Tufts experience reported here, there is little 
evidence to substantiate a “learning curve” in performing 
the myectomy operation (30). Indeed, the first 200 
myectomy operations were performed without mortality or 
major complications, with no outstanding differences with 
subsequent patients regarding operative metrics, extent

of gradient reduction, or symptomatic relief. These data 
argue that it is possible to initiate a new myectomy program 
within an HCM environment that will ultimately prove to 
be safe and effective (as Tufts did 13 years ago), and create 
what is now a large high volume center caring for 3,000 
patients. As a pertinent historical note, the Tufts myectomy 
program, now one of the largest in North America, was 
created in 2003 as part of a new HCM center with the 
support of Dr. Joseph Dearani (Mayo Clinic) who served as 
an early mentor to Dr. Rastegar.
Since the inception of the Tufts myectomy program, 
extended myectomy was adopted as the operative 
approach of choice, while simultaneously recognizing the 
contribution of mitral valve morphology and associated 
intraventricular muscular structures to outflow obstruction. 
In this regard, pre-surgical planning is performed routinely 
with cardiac imaging, including exercise echocardiography 
and CMR, with particular focus on the pattern and extent 
of ventricular septal hypertrophy, mitral valve structure and 
submitral morphology. 
With the information obtained by preoperative and 
intraoperative imaging, as well as the surgeon’s direct 
visualization during the myectomy, LV outflow tract 
structures judged to be contributing to obstruction 
prompted additional operative procedures, including 
revision of hypertrophied and abnormally displaced 
papillary muscles, resection of accessory LV apical￾basal muscle bundles, and cutting of chordal connections 
(5,31). In addition, congenital direct anomalous insertion 
of papillary muscle into the anterior mitral leaflet in the 
absence of chordae tendinae producing mid-cavitary 
outflow obstruction was identified intraoperatively, 
requiring muscular resection of the septum distal to the 
point of apposition and obstruction (5,32,33).
In a small subset of patients, the anterior mitral leaflet 
was particularly elongated, resulting in the site of subaortic 
obstruction displaced distally in the LV more than usual 
even after adequate muscular septal resection. In these 
patients, the mitral leaflet was plicated to stiffen the leaflet, 
eliminate mobility of the valve and decrease systolic 
anterior motion (SAM). Addition of these techniques to 
the extended muscular resection assured abolition of the 
outflow gradient.
All myectomy operations were conducted using 
intraoperative TEE, often employing gradient provocation 
with dobutamine or isoproterenol. This was completed 
both prior to initiating cardiopulmonary bypass to 
determine baseline measurements of gradient and degree

of mitral regurgitation, as well as after muscular resection 
off bypass to assess efficacy of the myectomy, confirm 
absence of mitral-septal contact and eliminate outflow 
obstruction. Intraoperative TEE before myectomy was 
also useful in clarifying the distribution and extent of 
ventricular septal thickening. This provides the surgeon 
with an accurate ‘road map’ for planning the depth and 
extent of muscular resection necessary to achieve optimal 
relief of outflow obstruction. In a small subset of patients 
(11%), intraoperative TEE findings demonstrated that it 
was necessary to reconstitute cardiopulmonary bypass for 
additional muscular septal resection or mitral interventions.
Evolution of the Tufts program addresses an unmet 
need in the contemporary management of this disease 
by partially closing the disparity between the number of 
obstructive HCM patients deserving of myectomy and 
the available number of surgeons experienced with this 
operation. This issue has been highly visible recently, given 
recognition that myectomy mortality rates in the practicing 
community outside of HCM centers can be as high as 6% 
(34,35), triggering a call for more cardiac surgeons to gain 
experience specifically with this operation and become 
available to the HCM patient population in high volume 
settings (35). 
Limitations
Postoperative echocardiograms were performed under basal 
conditions and therefore it was not possible to compare 
magnitude of gradient reduction among those HCM 
patients with pre-operative exercise-induced outflow tract 
gradients. However, the observation that heart failure 
symptoms were improved to a similar degree among 
HCM patients with rest versus provocable obstruction, 
suggests that clinically significant residual (post-operative) 
provocable gradients were not present. In addition, given 
the clinical and technical expertise involved with surgical 
management of obstructive HCM patients, our results 
might not be generalizable to centers performing myectomy 
at a lower volume.
In conclusion, over a relatively short period of 13 years, 
the HCM center at Tufts Medical Center has performed 
surgical myectomy in over 500 patients with obstructive 
HCM with excellent results comparable to surgical centers 
with longer experience with myectomy. Through this 
initiative, the natural history of many HCM patients have 
benefited substantially, including the aspiration for successful 
relief of outflow obstruction, extended longevity and 
restored quality of life. This experience provides precedent 
for future efforts creating new HCM programs to expand 
the access to surgical myectomy for obstructive HCM 
patients in the United States and internationally (36,37).
