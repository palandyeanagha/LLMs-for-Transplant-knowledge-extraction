Combined antifungal approach for the treatment of
invasive mucormycosis in patients with hematolog￾ic diseases: a report from the SEIFEM and
FUNGISCOPE registries
Invasive mucormycosis (IM) in patients with acute
leukemia and allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT)
recipients treated with antifungal monotherapy is associat￾ed with high mortality rates of 44-49%.
1-3 Among the
available antifungals, amphotericin B (AmB) formulations
and posaconazole demonstrate the most promising in
vitro activities against Mucorales,
4,5 and their combination
displays synergistic in vitro activity.
6,7 However, pre-clinical
studies in neutropenic and diabetic ketoacidotic mice with
IM reported no improvement in survival under a combina￾tion of posaconazole and liposomal amphotericin B (L￾AmB), compared to L-AmB monotherapy.
8,9 Given the rar￾ity of IM, these results have not been evaluated systemat￾ically in a clinical setting. Therefore, the value of combin￾ing a lipid formulation of AmB (Lip-AmB) with posacona￾zole for the treatment of IM remains a subject of contro￾versy and discussion.
Thirty-two patients with proven/probable IM treated
with a combination of Lip-AmB and posaconazole (Lip￾AmB+POS) between 2007 and 2012 were identified in
two large registries: SEIFEM (Sorveglianza Epidemiologica
Infezioni Fungine Emopatie Maligne) and Fungiscope – A
Registry for Emerging Fungal Infections.
Clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized
in Table 1. Of these patients, 31 were adults and all were
affected by hematologic malignancies, except 3 cases pre￾senting with severe aplastic anemia. Most IM occurring in
AML patients were documented during the first induction
treatment for the underlying disease. At diagnosis, 22
patients (69%) had a neutrophil count of less than
0.5x109
/L. Within one month prior to diagnosis, 12
patients had received steroids for the treatment of graft￾versus-host disease after allo-SCT (n=7) or for the treat￾ment of the underlying disease (n=5). Only 3 patients (9%)
were affected by diabetes mellitus that was unrelated to
steroid administration.
The diagnosis of IM was proven in 20 cases (63%) and
probable in 12 cases (38%). In approximately one-third of
cases (n=11), the infection was localized in the lower res￾piratory tract, while a disseminated infection (≥ 2 non-con￾tiguous sites) was detected in another 35% of cases (n=11).
Overall, 21 patients (66%) had received antifungal prophy￾laxis before the onset of IM for a median duration of 35
days (range 2-109). Only 3 cases had received prophylaxis
with agents with anti-Mucorales activity. Among the 22
patients (69%) who were neutropenic at the onset of IM,
16 (73%) recovered from neutropenia. Thirteen patients
(41%) underwent surgical excision of infected tissue. In
the majority of patients (29 cases, 91%), Lip-AmB+POS
was initiated due to lack of response to antifungal
monotherapy. In 20 patients (63%), only one line of
monotherapy had been administered for a median time of
18 days (range 13-64) before initiation of Lip-AmB+POS.
In 75% of these cases (n=15), an AmB formulation had
been administered: L-AmB (n=12), lipid complex AmB
(n=2), AmB (n=1). In the remaining 5 cases, posaconazole
(n=2), voriconazole (n=1) and caspofungin (n=2), had been
given. In 9 cases (28%), two different lines of treatment
had been administered prior to Lip-AmB+POS.
Lip-AmB+POS was administered as first-line treatment

to only 3 patients (9%). Among the 29 patients (91%)
receiving Lip-AmB+POS as second- or third-line treat￾ment, 27 (93%) received posaconazole as an addition to an
ongoing treatment with Lip-AmB. In 28 patients (88%),
posaconazole was administered at 800 mg/d, in 2 patients
(6%) at a lower dosage (400 mg/d and 600 mg/d) and in 2
patients (6%) at a higher dosage (1600 mg/d and 3200
mg/d). Lipid complex AmB was chosen for combination
with posaconazole in 5 patients (16%), L-AmB in 27
patients (84%). The standard dosage of L-AmB (3 mg/kg)
was used in 10 cases (32%) and a higher dosage (5 mg/kg
or more) in 17 cases (53%). Median duration of combined
treatment was 32 days (3-157 days). In 3 cases (9%),
deferasirox was added to Lip-AmB+POS.
None of the patients had to stop antifungal treatment
because of drug-related toxicity. A comparison of patients
who received L-AmB at 3 mg/kg with those who received
L-AmB at 5 mg/kg or higher found that none of them
showed relevant nephrotoxicity.
After a median follow up of three months, clinical
improvement of IM was observed in 18 patients (56%): 11
(34%) complete and 7 (22%) partial responses. Stable dis￾ease was demonstrated in 5 patients (16%). Nine patients
(28%) did not respond to treatment and died of progres￾sive IM. Of the 3 patients (9%) receiving Lip-AmB+POS as
front-line therapy, only 2 experienced a complete
response, while the third died of IM.
At Day 90 after the diagnosis of IM, 19 patients (59%)
had died, 9 due to progression of IM and 10 due to pro￾gression of the underlying hematologic disease; a clinical
improvement of IM was observed in 5 of these cases.
Maintenance treatment with oral posaconazole was
administered in all 18 responsive cases (56%) for a median
of 74 days (range 10-175 days) without relapse of IM.
Thirteen patients (41%) were still alive at least 12 months
after diagnosis of IM and displayed no signs of active infec￾tion; 11 of these patients (85%) were able to continue
treatment of the underlying hematologic malignancy and
4 (12%) underwent an allo-SCT without relapse of IM
after a time ranging between 9 to 16 months. In a univari￾ate analysis, allo-SCT and steroid administration were
negatively associated with treatment success. Recovery
from neutropenia was identified as a potentially protective
factor (Table 2). Due to the low number of cases at multi￾variate analysis, no parameters were identified as being
significant. In the vast majority of our cases, Lip-AmB was
used as front-line treatment, and posaconazole was added
when no satisfactory response was observed. Hence, Lip￾AmB+POS was prescribed as a salvage approach. In 56%
of our cases, a favorable clinical response was achieved
(>70% if stable disease was included into the definition).
This rate compares favorably with recent case series, in
which response rates ranged from 32% to 59%,
1-3 and
with the response rates reported from a compassionate use
trial that evaluated posaconazole as salvage therapy. In the
latter trial, 6 of 13 patients (46%) receiving Lip-AmB+POS
displayed a favorable response; all were partial responses.
10
Clearly, many factors besides the choice of antifungal
agents may have contributed to patient outcome. We were
not able to evaluate the impact of different Lip-AmB and
posaconazole dosages on patient outcome due to the lim￾ited number of cases and the lack of regular therapeutic
drug monitoring. Another important factor we could not
adequately control was the impact of surgical debridement
on patient outcome. In contrast with previous analyses,
3,11
surgical removal of infected tissue was not identified as a
protective factor. This may, however, be explained by the
limited sample size and a tendency to perform surgery
only on severely ill patients.
Finally, the influence of deferasirox could not be
assessed in our analysis. While previous in vitro studies as
well as animal studies suggested a synergistic effect of
deferasirox in combination with L-AmB,
12 a recent inter￾ventional trial examining this failed to confirm such an
association.
13 In our series, deferasirox was added only in 3
cases, all with a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, this
should only be considered a subjective observation.
In patients responding to therapy, maintenance treat￾ment with posaconazole was frequently administered for
prolonged periods of time. It permitted 11 patients (34%)
to continue treatment for the underlying malignancy, and
prevented relapse of IM during subsequent periods of neu￾haematologica 2013; 98:e128

tropenia. Interestingly, in 6 (19%) of these cases, an allo￾SCT could be performed.
Our case series may have been subject to selection bias,
as only those patients who survived long enough to
receive a combination therapy were included. However,
since interventional trials on this question are unlikely to
be performed any time soon, data from registries remain
the only available source of structured information on the
treatment of mucormycosis.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that a combined
antifungal treatment with Lip-AmB+POS may be consid￾ered in patients with very aggressive forms of IM.
