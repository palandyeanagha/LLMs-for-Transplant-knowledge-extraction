CTEP Agents and Agreements
The NCI first signs a Collaborative Research and Development
Agreement (CRADA) to develop and evaluate an agent under CTEP
IND. Then, the agent will be added to the List of Available CTEP
Agents for qualified investigators to propose pre-clinical and clinical
research studies. 
Available CTEP Agents
•  Available CTEP Agents Webpage
•  Available CTEP Agents (Excel Spreadsheet)
Industry Collaborations and Guidelines
CTEP has developed guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials
under a collaborative agreement with a pharmaceutical or biotech
company partner.  The Lead Protocol Organization is responsible for
ensuring compliance with these guidelines, including publication
review, data access, and data sharing, as well as intellectual
property licensing. 


•  Industry Collaboration Guidelines for NCI Clinical Trials

More information about the CTEP Intellectual Property Option
(CTEP IP Option) and model CRADAs, confidential disclosure
agreements, and MTAs are available on the CTEP IP Option and
Agreements page.
Network-Specific Information
PEP-CTN: Proposals for prioritization of an agent may be submitted
to the PEP-CTN Agent Prioritization Committee from PEP-CTN
members, COG Disease Committees, other academic research teams,
and pharmaceutical companies. Proposals are initiated using the
PEP-CTN Agent Prioritization (AP) Proposal form (Word). Questions
about the AP Proposal form and requests for a Pre-Review Meeting
can be addressed to: NCI-PEP-CTN@nih.gov. Consultation prior to
submission of an AP Proposal form is encouraged.
LOI and Concept Development
Letters of Intent (LOIs)
LOIs for small cancer treatment trials using available CTEP IND
agents can be submitted to the CTEP Protocol Information Office
(PIO) by the grantee organization in the ETCTN, NCTN, PBTC, PEP-
CTN, and AMC (US-only trials). 
NCTN, PBTC, and PEP-CTN grantees can also submit LOIs proposing
use of agents under their IND or for IND exempt trials. 
Early-career investigators in the ETCTN and NCTN are encouraged
to learn about applying to the Career-Development LOI (CRDL)
program for priority consideration.
LOI Form
•  LOI Submission Form (MS Word)


Concepts
NCTN Groups can submit concepts proposing larger cancer
treatment trials to PIO. When a trial has an appropriate integral
endpoint that needs additional support, a BIQSFP (Biomarker,
Imaging, and Quality of Life Studies Funding Program) application
can be submitted at the same time. BIQSFP applications for real-
time integrated endpoints should be submitted after a concept has
been approved. 
Concept Form and Checklist
•  Concept Submission Form (MS Word)
•  BIQSFP Information and Forms
•  NCTN AYA Checklist for NCTN concepts/protocols that
include Adolescent and Young Adults (AYA) (PDF)
CTEP Trial Development Timelines
CTEP's trial development timelines ensure that promising new
therapies can reach patients without undue delays. Investigators
may track their study’s progress online, and CTEP staff work with
investigators and collaborators during development to overcome
obstacles to protocol approval and activation.

Considerations for Protocol Development
and Design
Considerations for Protocol Submissions
•  Active CTEP Registrations: All study personnel listed on a
protocol title page must have an active CTEP registration at
the appropriate level.  Failure to ensure all study personnel
on the title page have active registrations can delay protocol
approval.  
•  Broadened Eligibility Criteria: CTEP's Broadened Eligibility
Criteria (PDF) should be used in all CTEP-supported network
trials unless there is a strong protocol-specific justification for
each more stringent criterion.
•  NCTN AYA Checklist: LPOs should use the NCTN AYA
Checklist (PDF) for NCTN concepts/protocols that include
Adolescent and Young Adults (AYA).
•  NCTN Streamlined Data Practices: IND-exempt phase 3
protocols should follow the NCTN Streamlined Data Practices
(PDF).
•  Standard Language for Protocols Under Collaborative
Agreement: Protocols under CTEP IND provided under a
 Collaborative Agreement must include the NCI/DCTD
Standard Language for Protocols Under Collaborative
Agreement (Word).
•  Early Phase ETCTN Trials with Biomarkers: LPOs should
refer to the Study Checklist for CTEP-Supported Early Phase
Trials with Biomarker Assays (Word).
CTEP Data Monitoring Methods and Data Reporting


Responsibilities
The required data monitoring method will be communicated at the
time of LOI or concept approval.  Data Mapping Utility (DMU)
reporting, either DMU Complete or DMU Light, is used for protocols
under CTEP IND that require enhanced monitoring.

Protocols that precede the Data Mapping Utility may still be using
CDUS reporting. The CDUS Instructions are provided for these
legacy trials.  
•  CDUS Instructions (legacy document)
Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card
A Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card must be
provided as a protocol appendix for a trial of a non-marketed agent
that has potential drug interactions.  


•  For studies under CTEP IND, the Handout and Wallet Card
will be authored by CTEP PMB.
•  For studies not under CTEP IND, the lead protocol
organization is responsible for authoring the Handout and
Wallet Card.
•  Additional patient-specific fields in the Handout and Wallet
Card are to be filled out by the site with the appropriate
information for each patient.

Potential Drug Interactions: CTEP Patient Drug Interactions
Handout and Wallet Card (Word)
After Trial Activation
After a CTEP-supported network trial activates, CTEP continues to
monitor and support the trial in different ways. 
Protocol Amendments
After CTEP has provided approval on hold or approval of a protocol
document, each subsequent protocol amendment submission should
include a summary of changes since the last CTEP-approved
protocol. 
Summary of Protocol Changes (Word)
Trial Status Updates
Credentialed staff from the lead protocol organization should make
trial status updates directly in the CTSU Protocol Application. All
protocol statuses from initial activation to FDAAA/IRB Complete
should be listed. 
The only status that can be set by PIO upon request from the LPO is
the final Administratively Complete status. 
Slow Accruing Trials


Enrollment to CTEP network trials is monitored to ensure it meets
the projected accrual rates that were reviewed and approved as part
of the trial development. Trials that are significantly below their
projected accrual rates may not be able to complete enrollment in a
reasonable timeframe.  The CTEP Slow Accrual Guidelines describe
how CTEP will evaluate accrual and what actions CTEP will require
for slow-accruing trials. These actions may include:
•  Corrective action plans
•  Amendments to enhance enrollment or redesign of the trial to
meet a more realistic accrual goal
•  Termination of a trial that is not expected to complete
enrollment
CTEP Slow Accrual Guidelines
•  Early Phase Trial Slow Accrual Guidelines (PDF)
•  Slow Accrual Guidelines for Phase 3 Trials (PDF)
•  Development of Slow Accrual Guidelines (PDF)
Lead Protocol Organization Responsibilities for
ClinicalTrials.gov Registration and Results Reporting 
ClinicalTrials.gov registration and results reporting is required by
law (Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments
Act, commonly called FDAAA, and the Final Rule) and NIH policy
(the NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH-Funded Clinical Trial
Information) for CTEP-supported clinical trials. 
The Lead Protocol Organization (LPO) is responsible for ensuring
the trials they lead comply with FDAAA 801, the Final Rule, and
the NIH policy requirements for clinical trials registration and
results reporting. This includes trials under CTEP IND.

ClinicalTrials.gov Registration and Results Reporting for CTEP-
Supported Clinical Trials (PDF) - June 2025


Ancillary Correlative and Biomarker
Studies
Investigators are encouraged to include judicious and evidence-
based correlative study proposals in their LOI and protocol designs.
These may be investigator-led, or may take advantage of one of
NCI’s biomarker development initiatives.
•  Investigators may conduct their own correlative biomarker
studies with review and approval by CTEP's Biomarker
Review Committee (BRC Study Checklist for LOIs).
•  ETCTN Trials may request sequencing or pharmacodynamic
assays through the National Clinical Laboratory Network
(NCLN).
•  NCTN Trials may apply for funding through the Biomarker,
Imaging, and Quality of Life Studies Funding Program
(BIQSFP).
•  After NCTN phase 3 trials have completed and reported
results, remaining specimens will be listed in the NCTN
Navigator website. Investigators can submit requests for
specimens directly through the NCTN Navigator site, and
those requests will be reviewed by CTEP and/or by the NCTN
Core Correlative Sciences Committee (NCTN-CCSC).
