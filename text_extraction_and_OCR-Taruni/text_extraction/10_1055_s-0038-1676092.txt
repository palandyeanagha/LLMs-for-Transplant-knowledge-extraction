A rare but potentially lethal complication of transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation is stent infec￾tion, referred to as “endotipsitis.”
1 This condition—due to
microorganism colonization of a TIPS stent graft with biofilm
formation—is associated with high morbidity and mortality
rates, and requires aggressive management with antibiotic
therapy and possible removal of theinfected device. Herein,we
present a case of endotipsitis attributed to transhepatic revi￾sion of an occluded TIPS created 3 years earlier, leading to
refractory sepsis requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy and
hospitalization, and ultimately orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion (OLT). We further provide an overview of endotipsitis, its
diagnosis, incidence, and management.
Case Presentation
A 65-year-old man underwent OLT in 2002 for liver cirrhosis
attributed to chronic hepatitis B and D virus infection. In
2012, he presented with cholangitis, and was found to have a
high-grade stricture at the biliary duct-to-duct anastomosis,
with associated choledocholithiasis and moderate intrahe￾patic biliary ductal dilation. He was treated with antibiotics,
resection of the stricture, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy,
and intraoperative choledochoscopy and lithotripsy.
In 2013, the patient presented with gastrointestinal (GI)
bleeding and was found to have recurrent cirrhosis and
bleeding gastric varices, refractory to endoscopic therapy.
A 10  60 mm TIPS covered stent graft was created, bridging
the right hepatic vein to right portal vein, and gastric and
esophageal varices supplied by the left and posterior gastric
veins were embolized with metallic coils.
In 2017, the patient was admitted for cholangitis. Mag￾netic resonance imaging demonstrated unchanged moderate
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation (►Fig. 1), TIPS occlusion,
and peri-graft enhancement and T2 prolongation, raising the
possibility of peri-graft inflammation and/or TIPS infection.
Symptoms of cholangitis resolved with ursodiol, a 4-day
course of intravenous (IV) piperacillin-tazobactam followed
by a 14-day course of oral amoxicillin and clavulanate.
TIPS revision was then attempted via a transjugular
approach to prevent variceal bleeding, but the intra-graft
thrombus was firm and could not be cannulated. Therefore,
after the administration of 2 g ceftriaxone IV, and under
sterile technique, the TIPS was recanalized via a transhepatic
approach (►Fig. 2).
In the hours after TIPS revision, the patient developed
fevers, rigors, altered mental status, tachycardia, and hypo￾tension; he was transferred to the intensive care unit for
vasopressor support and further management of septic
shock. A thorough evaluation for source of infection, includ￾ing computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
and transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated no clear
source of infection aside from chronic biliary ductal dilation.
He was treated with IV vancomycin and piperacillin-tazo￾bactam while blood cultures were pending; he was transi￾tioned to ceftriaxone after blood cultures grew Klebsiella
pneumoniae susceptible to this agent. Symptoms improved,
bacteremia cleared, and the patient was discharged on a 14-
day course of IV ceftriaxone. On follow-up in the interven￾tional radiology (IR) clinic 2 weeks after discharge, the
patient was stable, and the TIPS was patent on ultrasound.
One week later, the patient was brought to the IR suite for
transvenous obliteration of gastric varices under general
anesthesia. An 8-Fr sheath was introduced from a right internal
jugular vein approach through the TIPS andinto the portal vein;
splenoportography demonstrated occlusion of left and poster￾ior gastric veins from prior coil embolization, and gastric
varices supplied by innumerable diminutive portosystemic
shunts. Therefore, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous
obliterationwas performedwith a mixture of air, 3% Sotradecol

Fig. 1 Axial MR images of a 65-year-old man with history of OLT, with recurrent hepatitis B virus cirrhosis and TIPS creation 4 years earlier for variceal
bleeding, admitted for cholangitis. An irregular T1-hypointense rim (arrow) adjacent to the TIPS is present onT1-weighted images with fat saturation (a)with
corresponding peri-TIPS hyperenhancement (arrow) after administration of gadolinium contrast (b) and nonenhancement of the occluded lumen.
Enhancing gastric varices are also present (arrowheads). T2-weighted images with fat saturation (c) demonstrate a corresponding irregular halo of T2
prolongation (arrow) adjacent to the TIPS;moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation is also noted (arrowhead). In retrospect, peri-TIPS T2 prolongation and
enhancement in the setting of TIPS occlusion and cholangitis is suggestive of endotipsitis.
Fig. 2 Transhepatic revision of occluded TIPS. Under sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance (a) the intrahepatic portion of the TIPS was
percutaneously accessed with a 21-g needle directed toward the venous end, avoiding sonographically evident biliary radicals. A 0.018-in
guidewire was advanced into the TIPS under fluoroscopic guidance, and the needle exchanged for a 4/6-Fr sheath. A 4-Fr catheter was coaxially
introduced and a guidewire advanced into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Concurrently, a 10-Fr sheath was placed via the right internal jugular vein
into the inferior vena cava. The guidewire from the transhepatic access was then snared (b) to obtain through-and-through access; a tandem
0.035-in guidewire was introduced via the right internal jugular vein sheath to cannulate the TIPS and gain access into the portal vein (c). A new
10  80 mm stent graft (Viatorr) was ultimately deployed within the prior TIPS and dilated to 8 mm and patent on portal venography (d); the
resulting portosystemic gradient reduced from 10 to 6 mm Hg. The right internal jugular vein sheath was removed and hemostasis achieved with
manual pressure; the 6-Fr sheath was removed and the transhepatic tract was occluded with microfibrillar collagen paste.

(AngioDynamics, Queensbury, NY), and Lipiodol (Guerbet,
Princeton, NJ). He tolerated the procedure well without
immediate complication and was admitted for observation.
However, the following day, the patient developed fevers, chills,
lactic acidosis, and worsening renal function. Blood cultures
grew Candida albicans. A thorough evaluation again demon￾strated no clear source of infection. He was initiated on
micafungin and ultimately discharged on postoperative day
8 on a 14-day course of fluconazole.
Two weeks later, the patient presented to the emergency
department with melena. He was found to be pancytopenic
with iron-deficiency anemia. Upper GI endoscopy was
obscured by blood in the stomach. Direct TIPS evaluation
was performed via a right internal jugular vein approach;
angiography demonstrated high-grade stenosis at the cepha￾lad aspect of the shunt, in retrospect suggestive of a vegeta￾tion. This was treated with angioplasty with a 10-mm
balloon (Mustang; Boston Scientific, Spencer, IN) with reso￾lution of the stenosis and reduction of the portosystemic
gradient from 21 to 12 mm Hg. That evening, the patient
became febrile and was discharged the following day on
antibiotics after symptoms resolved.
Follow-up ultrasound 1 week later demonstrated TIPS
occlusion with recurrent ascites. Transjugular approach was
again unsuccessful due to firm thrombus. The TIPS was suc￾cessfully revised, again via a transhepatic approach with a final
portosystemic gradient of 9 mm Hg. The patient became
febrile immediately following the procedure with rigors,
hypotension, and worsening renal function. Blood cultures
grew Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin-resistant enterococ￾cus). He was treated with fluconazole and daptomycin. The
patient was discharged on linezolid in stable condition.
Considering all of the patients’ aggregate events, endotipsitis
was suspected due to sustained bacteremiawith no other source
identified, recurrent episodes of TIPS thrombosis, and worsen￾ing of sepsis following TIPS instrumentation. The patient was
then listed for OLT with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score of 22. An application was made to the United
Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) Review Board for exception
points for endotipsitis, and a MELD score of 26 was granted.
One week later, the patient reported to the emergency
department with abdominal distension, dyspnea on exertion,
and lower extremity edema in the setting of decompensating
cirrhosis. The patient was found to have Klebsiella oxytoca
bacteremia. The patient was ineligible for OLTuntil bacteremia
cleared. Increased velocities were noted within the TIPS graft
on ultrasound suggestive of recurrent stenosis, but TIPS revi￾sion was deferred in favor of medical optimization for OLT. He
was treated with imipenem, daptomycin, and oral vancomy￾cin. By hospital day 17, the patient’s MELD score increased to
36 and blood cultures had been negative for 11 days.
The patient then underwent OLT. Pathological and micro￾biological evaluation of the explanted TIPS demonstrated
culture-positive vegetations, confirming the diagnosis of
endotipsitis. Immunosuppressive agents were initiated con￾servatively due to the patient’s high risk of infection. He
recovered from the transplant and is doing well over 1-year
postoperatively.
Discussion
Endotipsitis is a rare but highly morbid complication of the
TIPS procedure, with an estimated incidence of approxi￾mately 1 to 10%1–6 and estimated mortality of 32%.7 The
range in incidence of this adverse event is due to the
relatively unreported outcomes of the TIPS procedure. Six
studies that describe retrospective analysis of all TIPS
procedures and suspected endotipsitis cases in six distinct
institutions each found a slightly different rate of incidence
of the infection. In 1998, Brown et al reported on 314
patients who underwent TIPS procedures from 1990 to
1995, and the rate of endotipsitis due to one causative
agent was found to be approximately 1%.3 Four patients
were found to suffer from Enterococcal bacteremia, all with
a thrombosed TIPS graft.3 Of the four bacteremic patients,
one was found to have acute endocarditis which may have
been responsible for the infection.3 Two of the patients died
from the infection and the other two underwent successful
repeat TIPS procedures.3 Other infective causes of bacter￾emia were not analyzed in this study.3 In 2000, DeSimone et
al described a total of 99 TIPS procedures performed
between 1992 and 1999.4 Ten of the 99 patients suffered
from sustained bacteremia and 5 of those 10 were likely
bacteremic due to infection in the TIPS graft, representing a
5% rate of endotipsitis.4 Of the five cases of endotipsitis,
three patients had a patent stent and two had thrombus
occluding the stent.4 All patients cleared the bacteremia on
IV antibiotics. Two of these patients died later from multi￾organ failure, one from hepatorenal syndrome, one was lost
to follow-up, and one was alive when the study was
published.4 In 2003, Armstrong and MacLeod detailed 180
TIPS procedures performed between 1992 and 2000, and
three cases of endotipsitis were identified, representing an
incidence of 1.7%.2 One patient had a patent TIPS graft, one
had an occluded graft, and one had an unknown graft
patency.2 Two of the three patients died from multiorgan
failure several weeks after the procedure and one was cured
of the infection and alive when the study was published in
2003.2 In 2010, Kochar et al reported on 778 TIPS proce￾dures performed from 1992 to 2006 and an additional 7
patients who had TIPS at outside institutions were followed
up at this center.1 Eight cases of endotipsitis were identi￾fied, or approximately 1% incidence.1 Of the eight cases, four
had a thrombosed graft, three had a patent graft, and one
was not recorded as patent or occluded.1 Five of the eight
patients died within 3 years of the TIPS procedure; in four of
those patients, endotipsitis was a contributing factor.1 In
2011, Mizrahi et al described 96 TIPS procedures performed
from 1996 to 2009 and 7 cases of endotipsitis were identi￾fied.6 This represents the highest incidence of the compli￾cation at 10.4%.6 Four of the seven patients had a thrombus
in the TIPS stent graft.6 Four of the seven patients died from
the infection, two died during treatment with negative
cultures, and one was alive at the time the study was
published in 2011.6
Endotipsitis has a variety of presentations, but nearly
always includes fever. Other presenting symptoms may

include chills, anorexia, malaise, anemia, diarrhea, and
shock.8 Early manifestation of endotipsitis (within 120
days of TIP creation) may be attributable to procedural graft
seeding.6,8 However, as in the presented case, endotipsitis
may present years after stent-graft implantation. Late infec￾tion is often associated with revision or manipulation of the
TIPS stent graft.2 One study found that the average time from
TIPS creation to bacteremia in patients with endotipsitis was
210 days, with a range from 6 to 732 days,9 and since that
study bacteremia within 24 hours has been reported as
well.10 The endotipsitis literature is predominantly limited
to case reports and small retrospective studies; a 2010
systematic review identified 36 reported patients.8 A review
of the literature published in 2017 identified 56 cases of
endotipsitis, concluding that the overall mortality of all
reported cases at that time was 32%.7 The use of broad￾spectrum prophylactic antibiotics in the TIPS perioperative
period has been found to be an effective method to prevent
infection and are widely used,4,6 though some institutions
prefer to individualize the use of prophylaxis.2,3,9
Recent case reports suggest that among the most fatal
infections documented include Staphylococcus aureas with
63% mortality and Candida species with 67% mortality on the
basis of a retrospective analysis of seven patients with S.
aureus and eight patients with candida infection.10,11 Two of
the eight patients with candida-associated endotipsitis
responded to antifungal therapy, while the remaining six
patients died from infection.10 These microorganisms can
create a biofilm on the graft that may not be eradicated by
antibiotics.12 In the case of recurrent infection or infection
refractory to treatment, ultimately only a liver transplant
may be curative.8,9,11
Stent grafts for TIPS were introduced in 1995, and are now
commonly utilized for the procedure.8,13,14 The term “endo￾tipsitis” was introduced in 1998 by Sanyal and Reddy who
identified eight cases meeting specific criteria. Though the
incidence is estimated to be 1 to 10%,1–6 it is likely that TIPS￾related infections have been underreported, in part because
there has not been a commonly accepted identification or
classification of the infection.2,4,7,15 In their 1998 publica￾tion, Sanyal and Reddy define endotipsitis as follows:
Definite infection: continuous, clinically significant (fever
and positive blood cultures) bacteremia, with vegetations or
thrombi inside the TIPS
Probable infection: sustained bacteremia and unremitting
fever in a patient with an apparently normal TIPS, and no
other obvious source of infection.16
Another definition was proposed by Armstrong and
MacLeod in 2003, as follows, “sustained bacteremia in a
patient with a TIPS device, with or without thrombus, plus
either no other identifiable infective focus or an identifiable
infective focus that is not considered to be the source of the
bacteremia after an exhaustive workup. “Sustained bacter￾emia” is defined as greater than or equal to 2 blood cultures
positive for the same organism, the first and last being
separated by greater than or equal to 7 days.2 This definition
was challenged by DeSimone, who agreed with the majority
of the definition but disagreed that the positive blood
cultures needed to be at least 7 days apart.17 Both authors
agreed that to have a definitive infection of the TIPS stent
graft a thrombus does not need to be present, which was part
of the original definition of definite infective endotipsitis
proposed by Sanyal and Reddy.
Despite these proposed definitions, there are still not
universally accepted criteria for diagnosis and treatment of
endotipsitis. An argument to adopt diagnostic criteria simi￾lar to Duke’s criteria for the diagnosis of endocarditis has
been made by some scholars.2,10,11,17 Both endotipsitis and
prosthetic valve endocarditis are endovascular infections of
prosthetic materials that are challenging to remove and
difficult to treat without removal once colonized due to
ingrowth of tissue.11,18 It is thought that not all of the graft
becomes endothelialized, leaving uncovered portions that
serve as areas of attachment and are more susceptible to
colonization by bacteria and fungus.6,12 While a sample
from the graft may be the ideal method to diagnose
endotipsitis, this is not always possible. Sampling the
thrombus, if present within the graft, is another way to
assess for infection.18
In the patient presented herein, endotipsitis was sus￾pected when the patient had recurrent episodes of bacter￾emia with a negative workup for any other source in the
setting of a thrombosed TIPS graft. Sepsis occurred after each
intervention through the TIPS after the patient initially
presented with cholangitis and TIPS occlusion. The bile ducts
were dilated and colonized, leading to contamination of the
TIPS stent graft from cholangitis, or during transhepatic
access for recanalization. The patient had undergone a
hepaticojejunostomy, inevitably penetrating the colonized
ducts and contributing to the spread of infection. Biliary
fistulas and cholangiolithiasis have been the suspected
source of TIPS infection in several studies.5,6,8,18 Biliary
intervention of any type increases the risk of infection.
Clearance of bacteremia and fungemia from the infected
stent graft was not achieved in the case described earlier,
despite prolonged antimicrobial therapy and the patient
was ultimately cured with liver transplant. Pathologic and
microbiological analysis of the TIPS stent graft from the
explanted liver found that the graft was colonized, con￾firming endotipsitis. On culture, the stent grew polymicro￾bial species, including E. faecium, K. oxytoca, C. albicans, and
C. gabralata. Colonization and vegetation formation lead to
recurrent, rapid thrombosis of the graft and the bacteremia
that the patient suffered following interventions through
the TIPS.
Conclusion
Infection, while rare, can colonize a TIPS stent graft, leading
to recurrent bacteremia and/or sepsis. In patients with a TIPS
stent graft who experience unexplained recurrent bactere￾mia and fever, a diagnosis of endotipsitis should be consid￾ered.6,8,9 Endotipsitis is associated with high morbidity, with
mortality rates reported at 32%.7 While prolonged antimi￾crobial therapy may resolve the infection, liver transplant
may be required.
