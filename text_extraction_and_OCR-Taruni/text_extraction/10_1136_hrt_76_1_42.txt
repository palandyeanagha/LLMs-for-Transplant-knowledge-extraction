Abstract


OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term benefits and safety of
aerobic training in patients with chronic heart failure. DESIGN:
Non-randomised control trial with 52 weeks follow up. SETTING:
Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation referral centre. PATIENTS:
Patients with compensated chronic heart failure (mean (SD) age 62
(6) years, New York Heart Association stage III, initial resting
ejection fraction 22 (7)%). Experimental group of 17 men, 4
women; control group 8 men, 1 woman. INTERVENTIONS:
Experimental group: progressive, supervised aerobic walking
programme for 52 weeks. Control group: standard medical
treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six-minute walk distance,
progressive cycle ergometer test to subjective exhaustion, disease-
specific quality of life questionnaire, and standard gamble test, all
measured at entry, 4, 8, 12, 16, 26, and 52 weeks. RESULTS:
Control data showed no changes except a small trend to improved
emotional function (P = 0.02 at 12 weeks only). Fifteen of the 21
patients completed all 52 weeks of aerobic training; two withdrew
for non-cardiac reasons (16, 52 weeks). Three were withdrawn
because of worsening cardiac failure unrelated to their exercise
participation (4, 4, 8 weeks), and one had a non-fatal cardiac arrest
while shopping (16 weeks). Gains of cardiorespiratory function
plateaued at 16-26 weeks, with 10-15% improvement in six-minute
walk, peak power output, and peak oxygen intake linked to gains in
oxygen pulse and ventilatory threshold and reductions in resting
heart rate. Marked improvements in quality of life followed a
parallel course. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic training is safe and
beneficial in compensated chronic heart failure. Gains in aerobic
function and quality of life persisted over a programme lasting 52
weeks.
