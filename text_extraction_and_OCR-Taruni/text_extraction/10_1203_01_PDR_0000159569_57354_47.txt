Biliary atresia (BA) is the most common and important
neonatal hepatobiliary disorder. Because current treatment is
inadequate, there is an urgent need to better understand the
etiology and pathogenesis of BA. Two major forms of BA are
recognized: an embryonic form associated with other congenital
anomalies and a perinatal form in which bile ducts were pre￾sumably formed normally but underwent fibro-obliteration in the
perinatal period. There are currently several proposed pathogenic
pathways leading to the phenotype of BA, including an immune
or autoimmune response to a perinatal insult (e.g. cholangiotro￾pic viral infection) and dysregulated embryonic development of
the extra- or intrahepatic biliary system. Recent advances in
developmental biology, genomics and genetics, and cell immu￾nology and biology, coupled with the development of appropriate
animal models, have provided support for these postulated mech￾anisms. Future investigations combining animal model work and
evaluation of clinical specimens holds the promise of identifying
the etiology of BA and providing a scientific basis for treatment
and preventative interventions. (Pediatr Res 57: 87R–94R,

BA is an enigmatic cause of neonatal cholestasis, occurring
in 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 18,000 live births and presenting typically
within the first months of life with jaundice, acholic stools, and
hepatomegaly in an otherwise apparently healthy infant (1).
Inflammatory obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts is
accompanied by a characteristic intrahepatic portal lesion. If
diagnosed in the first 2–3 mo of life, hepatic portoenterostomy
can restore bile flow from the liver into the intestinal tract in
30 – 80% of patients (1–3). Despite successful surgery, pro￾gressive inflammation and fibrosis of intrahepatic bile ducts
develops to varying degrees in all patients, leading to biliary
cirrhosis in the majority of patients. Consequently, 70 – 80% of
BA patients will eventually require liver transplantation, ap￾proximately half in the first 2 y of life (4 – 6). Thus, BA is the
most common indication for liver transplantation in children,
responsible for almost 50% of all pediatric liver transplants. It
should be emphasized that it is the intrahepatic biliary lesion
that determines overall prognosis and outcome, thus, this dis￾ease is no longer called “extrahepatic” BA. Without a better
understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this intrahe￾patic sclerosing cholangitic process in BA, little progress can
be expected in improving the nontransplantation outcome of
patients. Therefore, there has been a renewed interest in recent
years in understanding the underlying pathogenetic mecha￾nisms of BA.
It is now apparent that BA is a phenotype resulting from
several pathogenic processes that culminate in obstruction of
the biliary tree (1,7). The majority (80%) of cases of BA in
Western countries are of the perinatal or acquired form. These
otherwise normal infants are presumably born with a patent
biliary system which undergoes progressive inflammation and
fibro-obliteration initiated by a perinatal insult. Although the
etiology of this form is not completely understood, proposed
precipitating factors include infectious, toxic, vascular, and
immune mediators. The second form of BA is associated with
other congenital anomalies, most commonly involving abdom￾inal situs, and has been dubbed the embryonic or fetal form.
Defective morphogenesis, caused by mutations in genes regu￾lating biliary development, has been proposed in these cases. In

ABSTRACT
87R

this review, we will examine recent data supporting the pro￾posed viral and immunologic pathogenesis of the perinatal
form of BA, and the potential role for defective genetic regu￾lation of bile duct development in the embryonic form.
VIRAL AND OTHER INFECTIOUS AGENTS
Epidemiology. Epidemiologic studies support a possible
infectious etiology of BA. Multiple studies have demonstrated
seasonal clustering of cases suggesting environmental expo￾sure to an infectious agent. A population-based study in met￾ropolitan Atlanta (1968 –1993) revealed seasonal clustering of
BA diagnoses, with rates 3-fold higher in December through
March (OR  2.63 for winter compared with spring) (8).
Strickland and Shannon (9) found BA case clustering in north￾east Texas (2  13.89, p  0.001) and rural locales (2 
25.29, p  0.0001) and temporal association with fall com￾pared with the remainder of the year (2  5.96, p  0.015).
A recent study from the state of New York (10) reported
seasonal patterns of BA cases that varied by the region of the
state. Spring births were at highest risk for BA in New York
City and September to November births were at highest risk in
other regions of the state. In contrast, epidemiologic studies
from Europe have not consistently identified clustering of cases
(5,11). Inasmuch as epidemic infections may present at differ￾ent times of the year in different countries, it is still an open
question as to whether case clustering represents a true epide￾miologic association.
A second area of epidemiologic research has focused on the
birth weight and gestational age of infants with BA. Several
studies have revealed an association of low birth weight and
shortened gestation with the occurrence of BA. The case￾controlled study from New York state demonstrated an in￾creased risk of BA for LBW preterm and LBW term infants
(OR  2.92 and 2.36, respectively, compared with normal
weight infants) (10). A similar association was observed in the
Atlanta study (8), with term LBW infants having an increased
risk compared with term normal birth weight infants (OR 
3.52). Of greatest interest is a cohort study from Sweden that
used the Medical Birth Register of Sweden to assess risk of BA
(11). In this study, both small for gestational age (SGA) and
preterm status conferred an increased risk of BA. SGA infants
had a RR of 5.75 compared with that of appropriately sized
infants. Infants born between 22–32 wk of gestation had a RR
of 6.75 and those born at 33–36 gestational age had a RR of
2.48 compared with term infants. It is important to note that
most in utero viral infections are associated with intrauterine
growth retardation or preterm delivery.
Putative viruses. The ongoing search for a putative virus
involved in the pathogenesis of BA has led to conflicting
findings regarding at least three different viruses: reovirus,
rotavirus, and CMV. Interest in reovirus developed after the
observation that infection in weanling mice caused extrahe￾patic bile duct cyst formation and intrahepatic bile duct patho￾logic features similar to those of BA (12). Serologic studies
initially suggested an increased rate of infection with reovirus
in infants with BA and neonatal hepatitis (13,14), however,
subsequent studies could not confirm these findings (15,16).
Detection of reovirus antigens in the bile duct remnants from
an infant Rhesus monkey with BA (17) and from human
infants with BA (18) was reported, although the latter findings
were not replicated by others (15). Three groups of investiga￾tors have examined hepatobiliary tissues removed from infants
with BA for reovirus RNA. Steele et al. (19) failed to detect
reovirus RNA in archived, formalin-fixed preserved hepatic
tissues of 14 BA patients using nested RT- PCR. A recent
study from Japan likewise failed to identify reovirus RNA in
frozen biliary atresia hepatobiliary tissue, however, the average
age at the time of collection of the tissue was 8.7 mo (20). In
contrast, Tyler et al. (21) reported the detection of reovirus
RNA by RT-PCR in snap-frozen liver, gall bladder, or bile duct
remnants from 55% of cases of BA (average age 2.2 mo) and
in only 8 –15% of controls. The discrepancies among these
studies may lie in the age of the patients at the time of sample
acquisition, methods of preparation of the tissue, and the use of
PCR primers for different reovirus genes. It is also possible that
the proposed perinatal viral infection is cleared from the liver
within a relatively short period of time, resulting in the inabil￾ity to detect virus at the time of diagnosis or later, as has been
demonstrated in mouse BA models based on viral infection
(see below).
Another virus of the Reoviridae family, Group C rotavirus,
has received attention. Riepenhoff-Talty et al. (22) examined
hepatobiliary tissues of BA patients for RT-PCR evidence of
Group C rotavirus infection. Ten of 18 BA patients at diagnosis
and 0 of 12 liver disease control patients showed evidence of
rotavirus RNA. In contrast, Bobo et al. (23) failed to detect
rotavirus Groups A, B, or C RNA from 10 BA patients and 14
liver disease controls by RT-PCR techniques. However, almost
half the patients in that study were over 12 mo of age at the
time that tissues were obtained. Rotavirus has also been used to
develop a mouse model of BA. Rhesus rotavirus infection
produces extrahepatic bile duct obstruction by 2 wk of life
despite viral clearance in newborn mice (24,25). Timing of
infection was critical, with the highest incidence of cholestasis
if infection occurred in the first 12 h postpartum, after which
the incidence of disease diminished (26). It was proposed that
the rapidly developing immune system of the mouse over the
first week of life may be a factor responsible for the critical
window of time in which rotavirus infection may cause biliary
disease.
Twenty-three patients with BA were evaluated for CMV by
analyzing liver histology, CMV-IgM titers, or CMV viral
culture. Five patients (24%) were found to be positive for
CMV (27). A recent study from Brazil likewise found positive
CMV-IgM titers in 28.5% of patients with BA or choledochal
cysts (28). A study from Sweden (29) showed a higher prev￾alence of CMV antibodies in mothers of BA patients and CMV
DNA was present in livers from 50% of those infants. How￾ever, a Canadian group (30) could not demonstrate CMV in
bile duct remnants from 12 children with BA. Finally, other
viruses have also been examined including papillomavirus
(31,32) and herpes virus-6 (32) with similar conflicting results.
In summary, based on the similarities between the neonatal
murine models of reovirus and rotavirus and some human
studies showing about a 50% frequency of each of these
88R MACK AND SOKOL

viruses in infants with BA, further study of the roles of these
and related viruses in the etiology of BA are warranted. The
possible role of CMV, papillomavirus, and herpes virus-6 in
BA is likewise unsettled and requires further investigation.
There is scant literature regarding the potential role of
bacterial infection as a cause of BA. Tracy et al. (33) investi￾gated the expression of CD14, a monocyte cell surface receptor
activated by bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)],
on BA liver tissue obtained at the time of portoenterostomy.
Intense staining of CD14 was found on sinusoidal and portal
tract macrophages in BA tissue and not found in the portal
tracts of control specimens. Furthermore, Ahmed et al. (34)
compared the in situ expression of CD14 between early and
late stages of BA. Almost 70% of BA specimens at time of
portoenterostomy had extensive CD14 expression, especially
on sinusoidal Kupffer cells. The CD14 expression was mark￾edly decreased at the time of transplant. They proposed that
potential exposure to portally derived LPS leads to CD14
overexpression in BA resulting in macrophage activation with
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and bile duct damage.
This mechanism is theoretical at this point and warrants further
investigation.
ROLE OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IN BILE DUCT
INJURY AND OBSTRUCTION
At the time of diagnosis of BA, the extrahepatic duct
remnant is composed of fibrous tissue and scattered lympho￾cytes (35) whereas intrahepatic ducts are surrounded by a
mixed cellular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, macro￾phages, and eosinophils (36) (Fig. 1). The role of the immune
system in bile duct injury and obstruction is poorly understood
at present and is the focus of intense investigation. In the
following, the potential role of T-cell-mediated inflammation,
macrophage activation, and autoimmune processes are
examined.
T-cell-mediated inflammation. T-cell activation requires the
interaction of the T cell with an APC-bearing antigen in the
context of MHC class I (for cytotoxic CD8 T cells) or MHC
class II (for helper CD4 T cells). In the inflammatory envi￾ronment, naïve CD4 T cells differentiate to either Th1 effector
cells (driven by IL-12 and producing IFN-, IL-2, TNF-, and
TNF-) or Th2 effector cells (driven by IL-4 and producing
IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10). In biliary atresia, T-cell infiltrates
surround and invade intrahepatic bile ducts (37), characterized
predominantly by CD4 T cells (38 – 40), CD8 T cells (41),
or a mixture of both (42) (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, increased
expression of lymphocyte activation (LFA-1, IL-2 receptor)
and proliferation (transferrin receptor) were found in the portal
tracts of BA (40,43).
Activated effector T cells produce cytokines that can directly
damage epithelial cells or indirectly damage them through
stimulation of other immune cells. Recent investigation has

liver, other neonatal cholestatic liver diseases, and biliary atresia were incu￾bated with MAb, amplified with fluorescein labeled substrate (green), and
counterstained with nuclear stain DAPI (blue) (200 magnification). Portal
tracts were identified by characteristic vessel formation and bile duct epithelial
nuclear staining and verified by serial sections with cytokeratin 7 staining,
which is specific for bile duct epithelium (not shown). In normal livers, the
portal tracts are seen in the center of each photograph. In other cholestatic
diseases and biliary atresia the portal tracts are expanded and encompass the
entire field at 200 magnification. (A) CD8 T cells are more abundant in
biliary atresia portal tracts. (B) CD4 cell surface expression is found not only
on T cells but also on sinusoidal cells and Kupffer cells. To delineate the CD4
T cells, the tissue was double stained with anti-CD3  antibody (T-cell-specific
marker) (red) and CD4 antibody (green). Double-positive cells
(CD3CD4) are yellow. There is an increase in the number of CD3CD4
cells in biliary atresia portal tracts. The single-stained red cells (CD3CD4)
in biliary atresia reflects the CD8 T cells. Also note the single staining CD4
sinusoidal cells in the parenchyma surrounding the portal tract in normal liver
controls. (C) CD68 cells (macrophage/Kupffer cells) are increased in the
portal tracts of biliary atresia. Note the CD68 staining of cells in the
parenchyma of controls. Figure adapted from Mack et al., Pediatr Res

PATHOGENESIS OF BILIARY ATRESIA 89R

revealed that BA is associated with Th1-cell-mediated portal
tract inflammation. We have shown that the periductular im￾mune cells in BA produce IL-12, IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- (42).
This localized inflammatory profile was unique to BA and was
not found in other neonatal cholestatic diseases (42). Bezerra et
al. (44) used gene expression microarray techniques to analyze
BA liver biopsies and observed up-regulation of a number of
pro-inflammatory genes (including the Th1 cytokines IFN-
and osteopontin) and down-regulation of Ig genes (suggesting
inhibition of Th2 pathway). This laboratory then went on to use
the rotavirus-induced murine model of biliary obstruction to
demonstrate the importance of IFN- in the development of
this bile duct obstruction (45). IFN- knock out mice showed
increased survival after rotavirus infection and resolution of
bile duct obstructive lesions compared with wild-type controls,
verifying the critical role of this cytokine in the inflammatory
obstructive process. Further investigations of the role of vari￾ous cytokines in this model and in human BA are warranted in
that these may be potential targets for intervention.
There is limited data regarding the identity of the APC
responsible for complete T-cell activation in BA. Professional
APC include macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells,
whereas nonprofessional APC may include endothelial or ep￾ithelial cells (including bile duct epithelium). We and others
have shown dramatic increases in portal tract macrophages at
the time of diagnosis of BA (discussed below). Furthermore, in
our study, portal tract B cells were not increased compared
with controls. To date, the potential function of the dendritic
cell in the portal tract inflammatory response of BA has not
been reported.
Complete T-cell activation requires two signals from the
APC: 1) surface expression of self-MHC molecules bearing
antigen, which interact with the T-cell receptor; and 2) co￾stimulatory molecules B7-1 and/or B7-2, which interact with
CD28 on T cells (46). Competent APC also express intercel￾lular adhesion molecules (ICAM) to provide adhesion of APC
to the T cell. Investigation of the expression of these molecules
in BA has been carried out by standard immunohistochemistry
techniques. Strong cell surface expression of HLA-DR (MHC
class II) was found on Kupffer cells and to a lesser degree on
intrahepatic bile duct epithelium (39,47). Furthermore, Koba￾yashi et al. (48) recently demonstrated increased expression of
B7-1 and B7-2 on intrahepatic bile duct epithelium and Kupffer
cells in those patients with advanced diseased at presentation.
Amplified expression of ICAM on bile duct epithelium of BA
liver biopsies has also been described (38 – 40). Thus, there is
accumulating evidence for Kupffer cells and bile duct epithelial
cells as potential APC in BA.
Macrophage activation. Portal tracts of BA patients are
laden with macrophages (42,47,49) and it appears that the
intensity of the macrophage infiltrate correlates with a worse
prognosis. Kobayashi et al. (47) found that patients with no
bile flow after the portoenterostomy had markedly increased
numbers of portal tract macrophages at diagnosis. Davenport et
al. (40) reported prominent macrophage staining in the portal
tracts of BA patients. The intensity of the staining correlated
with macrophage activation, as evidenced by an increase in the
lysosome-rich cytoplasmic volume, and with poor outcome
after portoenterostomy.
Activated macrophages produce cytokines IL-12 and IL-18,
which function together to promote Th1 cellular differentiation.
We demonstrated increased mRNA expression of IL-12 in
livers of BA patients at diagnosis (42) and Urushihara et al.
(50) reported macrophage activation and increased serum
IL-18 in BA patients. Macrophages also secrete cytotoxic
cytokines such as TNF-, which are markedly up-regulated in
BA (42). TNF- may also, through receptor binding, induce
apoptotic or necrotic cell pathways causing persistent bile duct
epithelial injury. To that end, Funaki et al. (51) showed that
almost 50% of intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells in BA liver
were apoptotic compared with only 2.5–3.6% in the control
groups. Another cell death pathway is triggered by the inter￾action of Fas-ligand (FasL) with Fas-bearing cells. FasL is
expressed predominantly on activated T cells and monocytes/
macrophages. Liu et al. (52) reported that Fas was expressed
weakly on bile duct epithelium of both BA and normal liver,
however, strong expression was found on 25% of BA samples
and none of controls. Aberrant FasL expression was present in
bile duct epithelial cells in approximately 30% of BA speci￾mens as well as in the majority of portal tract monocytes.
Interestingly, FasL expression on bile duct epithelia was asso￾ciated with poor bile flow postportoenterostomy.
In summary, characterization of the hepatic immune re￾sponse present at the time of diagnosis of BA (Table 1) forms
the basis of the following hypothesis. It is proposed that an
initial insult to bile duct epithelia (e.g. a cholangiotropic virus)
leads to HLA-DR-restricted Kupffer cell (or bile duct epithe￾lium) presentation of antigens (derived from virus or altered
self-antigens on bile duct epithelia) to CD4 T cells with
subsequent differentiation and proliferation of effector Th1
cells and local release of IL-2, IFN-, and TNF-. IFN--
stimulated release by macrophages of TNF- and nitric oxide
could lead to bile duct epithelial cell apoptosis and necrosis,
obstruction, and, ultimately, fibrosis. Continued investigations
using animal models and human tissues should help better

define the key factors stimulating and perpetuating this im￾mune response.
BA as an autoimmune disease. The progressive nature of
BA, despite initial re-establishment of bile flow with a por￾toenterostomy, suggests that a persistent autoimmune attack
directed at bile ducts may play a role (53,54). In BA, it is
possible that the initiator of the bile duct injury is a cholan￾giotrophic virus, leading to the exposure of altered self bile
duct epithelial antigens or previously sequestered self bile duct
antigens that would then be recognized as “foreign” and elicit
a persistent autoimmune-mediated bile duct injury. It is also
possible that molecular mimicry, whereby the virus contains
antigens that cross-react with self bile duct epithelial antigens,
elicits immune responses against both viral and self antigens
(54,55).
The Rose and Witebsky criteria (56) used to define an
autoimmune disease include evidence of lymphocytic infiltrate,
presence of autoantibodies or evidence on an autoantigen,
association with other autoimmune disorders in the patient or
family, and HLA association. There is clearly a predominance
of lymphocytes in BA liver tissue. The search for autoantibod￾ies has yielded preliminary results. Vasiliauskas et al. (57)
reported that 10 of 11 patients with BA were positive for serum
IgG and IgM antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA),
with higher levels of the IgM-ANCA in BA patients compared
with children and adults with other liver diseases. At our
center, Burch et al. (58) examined lupus autoantibodies in
mothers of children with BA and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis
to test the hypothesis that maternal transfer of autoantibodies
might be involved in liver and bile duct injury in the infant.
Low titer anti-Rho antibodies were more prevalent in mothers
of infants with BA and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis than in
controls, and low titer antinuclear antibodies were more com￾mon in mothers of infants with liver disease. To date, there
have been no studies addressing the frequency of other auto￾immune diseases in BA patients or in other family members.
Interestingly, children with BA who undergo liver transplant
have a 2.5% risk of developing de novo autoimmune hepatitis
after transplantation (59,60), perhaps indicating a genetic pre￾disposition to autoimmune disease.
Multiple inherited genetic polymorphisms are believed to
contribute to autoimmune disease susceptibility; the strongest
associations are with HLA genes, especially HLA-DR, -DQ, or
-DP (MHC-class II equivalent) (46). For example, increased
frequencies of HLA B8 and DR3 are found in patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis (61,62) and HLA A1-B8-DR3
and DR4 are risk factors for autoimmune hepatitis (63). Inves￾tigators have explored the possibility of a link between HLA
type and BA with conflicting results. Rosenthal et al. (64)
suggested an increased frequency of HLA-Cw4/7 in BA. Sil￾veira et al. (65) reported a significantly higher prevalence of
HLA-B12 and A-Kader et al. (66) from Egypt observed sig￾nificant increases in both HLA B8 and DR3. Only 55 and 18
BA patients were analyzed, respectively, and serological phe￾notype techniques were used. More recently, DNA genotyping
has been adapted for HLA typing, yielding a greater number of
HLA loci and alleles to be tested with much greater accuracy.
Using DNA genotyping, Donaldson et al. (67) found no HLA
associations in 101 BA patients from the United Kingdom. It is
clear that a large, multicentered study of HLA genotyping
(including high resolution of HLA-class II) and a sample size
calculated to generate statistically sound results is needed.
MORPHOGENESIS GENES AND BILIARY ATRESIA
Laterality genes. It has been proposed that the embryonic
form of BA is caused by defective development of the biliary
tree. The association of anomalies of visceral organ symmetry
with BA (the polysplenia or BA splenic malformation syn￾drome) implies that genes that control normal situs develop￾ment are also key regulators of normal extrahepatic bile duct
development. The initial animal model that suggested this class
of genes was that of a recessive insertional mutation in the
proximal region of mouse chromosome 4 or complete deletion
of the inversion (inv) gene in the mouse (68,69). This mouse
model, with laterality defects in abdominal organ placement,
also included anomalous development of the hepatobiliary
system. Therefore, the human INV gene, recently mapped by
Schon and colleagues (70), was examined in 64 patients with
heterotaxia. No mutations were found in seven patients with
BA and various congenital laterality defects, making it unlikely
that the INV gene is responsible for the majority of embryonic
cases of BA. Interestingly, recessive mutations in INV were
recently described in children with nephronophthisis type 2
(71), a disease in which abnormal biliary development has
been described (72). Moreover the INV protein was found to
interact with nephrocystin, both being located on the primary
cilia of renal tubular cells (71). Thus, gene products with
localization to the mechanosensory primary cilium of renal
tubular cells and cholangiocytes may produce aberrant biliary
development with predominance of ductal plate malformation.
In this regard, there is subset of patients with BA who have a
ductal plate malformation-like lesion in portal tracts, and who
are believed to have a worse prognosis (73). It remains to be
seen whether mutations or polymorphisms of genes that code
for proteins regulating functions of the primary cilia will play
a role in the pathogenesis of BA.
More than 30 other mammalian proteins have now been
described that are involved in establishment of left-right pat￾terning during embryogenesis, although few have been exam￾ined in BA. Bamford et al. (74) analyzed the CFC1 gene
(which encodes the human CRYPTIC protein) in genomic
DNA from 144 cases of familial and sporadic cases of laterality
defects. Heterozygous mutations were identified in nine pa￾tients, including one with BA and the polysplenia syndrome.
Jacquemin et al. (75) subsequently found heterozygous gene
mutations in two brothers with laterality defects, one of whom
had BA, which were inherited from their unaffected mother.
Thus, heterozygous CFC1 mutations may predispose to BA,
but also appear to require a second genetic or environmental
factor to produce the BA phenotype. The CRYPTIC protein
acts as a cofactor in the Nodal pathway that determines left￾right axis development potentially through its function in the
transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway (75).
ZIC3 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that translo￾cates to the nucleus and influences left-right axis determina￾PATHOGENESIS OF BILIARY ATRESIA 91R

tion. In 2004, Ware et al. (76) reported eight ZIC3 mutations in
194 heterotaxia patient samples and calculated that mutations
in this gene were responsible for approximately 1% of patients
with sporadic heterotaxy. Among the patients with mutations
and complex congenital heart disease, two had BA, one abnor￾mal liver lobulation, and one cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
Thus, there appears to be an association between mutations in
this gene and isolated cases of BA and heterotaxia. Evaluation
of ZIC3 in a larger population of patients with BA, with and
without other congenital anomalies, will be of interest. Other
human genes that determine laterality (LEFTYA and ACVR2B)
and cell adhesion (CRELD1 and NKX2.5) have been associated
with a small percentage of human situs defects (76). Interest￾ingly, Zhang et al. (77) recently reported no differences in
mRNA expression of a panel of laterality genes in liver from
embryonic versus perinatal cases of BA. Future investigations
of these and other genes in coming years may shed light on
whether inherited or somatic mutations or deletions are respon￾sible for individual cases of BA.
Intrahepatic bile duct development and BA. Normal devel￾opment of intrahepatic bile ducts is controlled by interactions
between mesenchyme and portal venous radicals, forming the
ductal plate. The ductal plate is derived from a subset of
hepatoblasts that differentiate into a single-layered ring of
biliary precursor cells that surround portal venous branches and
their encompassing mesenchyme within the liver (reviewed in
78,79), occurring by 5 wk gestation. Remodeling of the ring of
cells occurs over the next 6 –7 wk. This single layer of cells
becomes partly bi-layered followed by the development of
focal dilated areas between the two cell layers, which soon give
rise to the portal tract bile ducts. Abnormal remodeling of the
ductal plate leads to the ductal plate malformation that is
present in congenital hepatic fibrosis and other bile duct dys￾plasias. Interestingly, a number of infants with BA show
evidence of the ductal plate malformation on liver biopsy (73).
Polymorphisms in HNF6, HNF1-B, JAGGED1, PKDH1, or
other related genes that regulate remodeling of the ductal plate
(80 – 82) could act as susceptibility factors or modifier genes
necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of BA. In this
regard, Kohsaka et al. (83) identified JAGGED1 missense
mutations in 9 of 102 patients with BA, who had no phenotypic
features of Alagille syndrome. Remarkably, prognosis was
worse in the group with mutations, suggesting that JAGGED1
could be a modifying factor in BA. However, other factors
known to influence prognosis in BA, such as age at time of
portoenterostomy, were not elucidated in the report. Thus, it is
not clear whether these patients had an unusual form of BA
caused by mutations in JAGGED1, whether the phenotype
reported was a unique presentation of Alagille syndrome, or
whether the gene functioned as a modifying factor in BA.
These observations remain to be confirmed but support the
possibility that predisposition to BA may have a genetic basis.
Just how a defect in ductal plate remodeling could lead to
atresia of the extrahepatic biliary tree is not intuitively obvious.
The hypothesis of Tan and colleagues may shed light on this
quandary. Tan et al. (84) have demonstrated the presence of
extravasated bile in bile duct remnants of BA patients, pro￾posed to have originated from breaks in the biliary mucosa at
the porta hepatitis. The supposition is that there is a vulnerable
stage of human biliary development between 11 and 13 wk of
gestation, when failure of remodeling of the ductal plate struc￾tures could lead to disturbances in the normal development of
the mesenchymal cuff that surrounds developing hilar bile
ducts. Alternatively, connections of the hepatic ducts (derived
from tubulization of the ductal plate structures) with the ex￾trahepatic bile ducts could be perturbed. Either of these alter￾ations could potentially cause hilar bile ducts to rupture at the
initiation of bile flow at 12–13 wk of gestation. Extravasated
bile, with its detergent properties, into adjacent periductal
tissues would then lead to protracted inflammation and sclero￾sis in the submucosa, causing secondary obliteration and ob￾struction of the more distal extrahepatic bile duct. This hypo￾thetical mechanism was first described by Rolleston and Hayne
(85) in 1901, who coined the term “descending cholangitis.”
SUMMARY
Recent advances in developmental biology, genetics,
genomics, and cell biology have opened the door to a better
understanding of the underlying mechanisms causing BA. A
unifying hypothesis is provided in Figure 3, illustrating the
proposed stereotypic response of the infant biliary tree to a
variety of insults, both prenatal and postnatal. Embryonic BA
may be the result of mutations in genes controlling normal bile
Figure 3. Proposed pathways for pathogenesis of two forms of BA. Perinatal
BA may develop when a perinatal insult, such as a cholangiotropic viral
infection, triggers bile duct (BD) epithelial cell injury and exposure of self- or
neo-antigens that elicit a subsequent immune response. The resulting inflam￾mation induces apoptosis and necrosis of extrahepatic BD epithelium resulting
in fibro-obliteration of the lumen and obstruction of the BD. Intrahepatic bile
ducts may also be targets in the ongoing TH1 immune (autoimmune?) attack
and the cholestatic injury, resulting in progressive portal fibrosis culminating
in biliary cirrhosis. Embryonic BA may be the result of mutations in genes
controlling normal bile duct formation or differentiation, which secondarily
induces an inflammatory/immune response within the common bile duct and
liver after the initiation of bile flow at approximately 11–13 wk of gestation.
Secondary hepatocyte and intrahepatic bile duct injury ensue either as a result
of cholestatic injury or as targets for the immune (autoimmune?) response that
develops. The end result is intrahepatic cholestasis and portal tract fibrosis,
culminating in biliary cirrhosis. Other major factors may be the role played by
genetic predisposition to autoimmunity and modifier genes that determine the
extent and type of cellular and immune response and the generation of fibrosis.

duct formation or differentiation, which secondarily induces an
inflammatory response within the liver that injures and sclero￾ses intrahepatic bile ducts. Perinatal BA may develop when a
perinatal insult triggers bile duct epithelial injury and a subse￾quent immune response that damages both extrahepatic and
intrahepatic bile ducts. Other major factors may be the role
played by genetic predisposition to autoimmunity and modifier
genes that determine the extent and type of cellular and im￾mune response and the generation of fibrosis. Over coming
years, multi-institutional and interdisciplinary collaborations
will set the stage to provide the needed patient samples and
technology to unravel the pathogenesis of this uniquely neo￾natal disorder, with the hope of developing a scientific ratio￾nale for innovative treatment and preventative approaches.
