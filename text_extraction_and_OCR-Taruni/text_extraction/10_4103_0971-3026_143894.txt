Abstract
Post lung transplant complications can have overlapping clinical and imaging features, and hence, the time point at which they 
occur is a key distinguisher. Complications of lung transplantation may occur along a continuum in the immediate or longer 
postoperative period, including surgical and mechanical problems due to size mismatch and vascular as well as airway anastomotic 
complication, injuries from ischemia and reperfusion, acute and chronic rejection, pulmonary infections, and post‑transplantation 
lymphoproliferative disorder. Life expectancy after lung transplantation has been limited primarily by chronic rejection and infection. 
Multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) is critical for evaluation and early diagnosis of complications to enable selection 
of effective therapy and decrease morbidity and mortality among lung transplant recipients.

Transplant Imaging
Introduction
Lung transplantation is an accepted therapeutic option 
for patients with end‑stage lung disease. The indications 
for transplantation span the spectrum of pulmonary 
diseases [Table 1]. Three transplantation procedures are 
commonly performed: Single‑lung transplantation (SLT), 
bilateral lung transplantation (BLT), and heart‑lung 
transplantation. BLT is required for patients with 
bronchiectasis including cystic fibrosis and for patients with 
significant pulmonary arterial hypertension. Either BLT 
or SLT may be performed in patients with diseases other 
than bronchiectasis and pulmonary hypertension, unless 
special considerations dictate the use of BLT. Nevertheless, 
over the past decade, BLT has been increasingly used 
due to better long term survival, particularly among 
patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD).[1‑3]
Heart‑lung transplantation was traditionally required for 
secondary pulmonary hypertension due to cardiac causes 
(Eisenmenger  syndrome). However, with improvements 
in supportive technology and experience with transplant 
procedure, heart‑lung transplantation has become very 
infrequent.
Survival rates for lung transplant patients remain fairly 
low, with the median survival after lung transplantation 
being 5.3 years.[4] Although lung transplantation is a 
well‑established procedure, complications are frequent. 
Life expectancy after lung transplantation has been 
limited primarily by chronic rejection and infection.[4]
Post‑transplantation management comprising monitoring 
allograft function, regulating immunosuppressive regimen, 
as well as detecting and treating complications expeditiously 
is crucial to optimize patient outcome.
Early and accurate diagnosis of complications can be 
challenging. Causes of complications are varied, ranging 
from technical problems to host immune response and 
predisposition to infections. Several of these complications 
may coexist, resulting in complex radiologic pictures. Given 
the degree of complexity, an interdisciplinary approach 
is important. Bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, 
and transbronchial biopsy may be required to identify

complications. Radiologist’s awareness of complications and 
associated imaging features that may occur at varying time 
points following transplantation is essential to effectively 
guide clinical management.
This article will illustrate imaging features of a spectrum of 
complications that may occur following lung transplantation. 
As many of these complications can have overlapping 
clinical and imaging features, the time point at which they 
occur is a key distinguisher. Post lung transplantation 
complications are categorized according to the temporal 
relationship related to the operation as immediate (<24 h), 
early (>24 h‑1 week), intermediate (8 days‑2 months), 
primary late (2‑4 months), and secondary late (>4 months) 
complications.[5] Table 2 lists a comprehensive, but by no 
means complete checklist of complications which can assist 
the radiologist and clinician in evaluating a patient following 
lung transplantation. Use of problem‑specific multiple 
detector computed tomography (MDCT) airway protocols is 
also discussed for evaluation of unique complications such 
as bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchomalacia.
Immediate complications (<24 h)
Donor‑recipient size mismatch
The donor and recipient are matched for size preoperatively. 
Size matching is gauged primarily by body height; however, 
thoracic volume is somewhat pliable and some size 
discrepancies do not affect overall survival or pulmonary 
function, and therefore are acceptable.[6] If the donor 
lung is too large for the recipient, passive atelectasis may 
manifest on an immediate postoperative chest  radiograph. 
In addition to decreased pulmonary function in the 
immediate post‑transplantation period, superimposing 
complications in the atelectatic lung may result in scarring 
and further reduction in lung volume. Donor lungs that 
are considered too large may require surgical downsizing 
prior to transplantation. At the other extreme, an undersized 
donor lung can result in mechanical problems related 
to residual space, such as intractable pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. When a small donor lung is used in single 
transplantation for emphysema, hyperexpansion of the 
native emphysematous lung may cause compression of 
the transplanted lung, thereby inhibiting its function. In 
this situation, surgery to reduce the native lung volume or 
bullectomy may prove beneficial.[7]
Hyperacute rejection
Hyperacute rejection is an immediate, complement‑mediated 
injury that leads to acute onset of alveolar damage, resulting 
in graft dysfunction or failure within minutes to hours 
following graft reperfusion. It occurs when the preformed an 
ti‑human leukocyte antigen(anti‑HLA) or anti‑ABO antibody 
in the recipient reacts with a corresponding or cross‑reactive 
antigen in the donor organ. With detailed attention to 
ABO compatibility and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
characteristics of the donor and recipient, this phenomenon 
has become exceedingly rare. On radiograph, hyperacute 
rejection manifests as dense homogeneous opacification 
throughout the allograft.[8‑10] Management options are 
limited, but may include aggressive immunosuppression, 
plasmapheresis, and urgent retransplantation.[8]
Early complications (>24 h‑1 week)
Primary graft dysfunction ( re p e r f u s i o n e d e m a o r 
ischemia‑reperfusion injury)
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a nonspecific, 
non‑cardiogenic acute lung injury characterized by diffuse 
alveolar damage and increased vascular permeability. PGD 
results from insults that are inherent in the transplantation 
process, including donor lung ischemia, organ procurement 
and preservation techniques, and organ implantation and 
reperfusion.[11] PGD appears within 72 h of transplantation, 
peaks in severity on postoperative day 4, and generally

improves by the end of the first week.[12] Radiographic and 
CT manifestations are variable and nonspecific, but most 
commonly comprise middle and lower lobe predominant 
airspace opacities.[12] Mixed airspace and interstitial opacities 
with bronchial and vascular wall thickening may be seen.[5,12]
Hyperacute and acute rejection should be considered in 
the diagnostic evaluation of PGD. Management typically 
remains largely supportive and follows the paradigm used 
in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).[12]
Pleural complications
Acute pleural complications including pleural effusion, 
pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, and air leaks 
occur in 22‑34% of patients following lung transplantation 
[Figure 1].[13,14] Development of early pleural effusion 
is thought to be due to ischemia, denervation, and 
subsequent reperfusion of the allograft or by disruption of 
the pulmonary lymphatics.[13] Pleural effusion recalcitrant 
to chest tube drainage should raise suspicion for other 
causes such as empyema, chylothorax secondary to severed 
thoracic duct, and heart failure.[15]   Persistent pneumothorax 
beyond the early postoperative period raises concern 
for underlying bronchial anastomotic complications. CT is 
often helpful in characterizing and guiding management 
of complex pleural processes.
Intermediate complications (8 days‑2 months) and primary 
late complications (2‑4 months)
Acute rejection
Acute rejection is due to cell‑mediated immune response. 
Approximately half of patients have at least one episode 
of acute rejection in the first year following transplant.[16]
Recurrent acute rejection is a risk factor for the development 
of chronic rejection.[16]
Acute rejection has a radiographic appearance similar 
to PGD; airspace abnormalities such as groundglass 
opacities with accompanying septal thickening and 
pleural effusion may be seen Figure 2.[17] Of note, patients 
may present with subclinical acute rejection in the absence 
of imaging abnormalities. Significant improvement of 
radiographic abnormality following intravenous steroid 
administration within 48-72 h favors diagnosis of acute 
rejection .[18]
Anastomotic complications
Lung transplantation involves three different anastomoses: 
Airway, pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary vein to left 
atrium.
Airway and bronchial anastomotic complications
Commonly seen airway complications include stenosis 
and airway infection. The prevalence is approximately 
15%.[19] Dehiscence is a rare airway complication of 
transplantation. Dehiscence and infection are seen earlier in 
the postoperative period (1 week‑2 months), while stenosis 
and bronchomalacia are seen later at 2‑4 months post 
procedure. Key risk factors predisposing to airway‑related 
complications include donor bronchus ischemia caused 
by disruption of native bronchial circulation, followed 
by recurrent rejection and infection. There has been a 
decrease in airway complications following refinements 
in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapy. 
Advances in MDCT technology and newer flexible 
ultrathin bronchoscopic techniques have facilitated 
early detection and management of airway anastomotic

complications.[20] CT can demonstrate focal mucosal 
irregularities, necrosis, and debris formation at an 
advanced stage, whereas findings are seen much earlier 
on bronchoscopy.
Partial dehiscence is more common than complete 
dehiscence, and presents as enlarging ipsilateral 
pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. MDCT with 
thin section curved planar reformations may show 
focal bronchial wall defects and perianastomotic air 
collections [Figure 3]. Most of these are managed 
conservatively as they may resolve spontaneously. It 
is important to be aware of the anastomotic surgical 
technique used as the telescoping bronchus may 
mimic dehiscence [Figure 4]. This involves end‑to‑end 
anastomosis of the posterior membranous portion of the 
larger bronchus and invagination of the cartilaginous 
portion of the smaller bronchus into the larger bronchus. 
The telescoped segment has the appearance of a bronchial 
wall defect or small tubular extraluminal gas collection. 
Curved planar reformations are exquisite in separating 
telescoping bronchus from dehiscence.[21]
Anastomotic stenosis is more common than dehiscence, 
and can be seen later in the postoperative period. Thin 
section axial and curved planar reformations as well 
as virtual bronchoscopy may show areas of fixed focal 
narrowing and irregularity [Figure 4]. Alternatively, 
patients may present with recurrent lobar collapse 
[Figure 5], in which case proximal airway stenosis 
should be actively assessed for. Management includes 
debridement of granulation tissue, balloon dilation, and/
or stent placement.
Transient airway narrowing or dynamic bronchomalacia 
can be detected on bronchoscopy as well as on CT. Paired 
end‑inspiratory and dynamic expiratory CT images 
are compared to identify if there is greater than 50% 
reduction in airway diameter or lunate shape of the 
airway.[22]
Vascular anastomotic complications
Post lung transplant arterial obstruction is more common 
than venous obstruction. Common causes of narrowing 
include excessive length of vascular pedicle, short allograft 
artery length, and presence of restrictive suture and clot. 
Pulmonary artery stenosis can occur early and late after 
lung transplantation.[23] Patients may present with shortness 
of breath, hypoxia, signs of pulmonary hypertension, and 
right heart failure, and non‑resolving pulmonary opacities 
secondary to infarction on radiographs and CT [Figure 6]. 
Contrast‑enhanced CT angiogram may show narrowing 
or occlusion leading to non‑resolving pulmonary opacities 
secondary to lung infarction or anastomotic dehiscence 
leading to catastrophic hemothorax. Treatment includes 
angioplasty and stenting.

Pulmonary infections
Pulmonary infections are an important cause of morbidity 
and mortality. Certain infections are more commonly seen 
than others in a given postoperative period [Table 3]. CT is 
useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis, identifying 
the severity of infection, and selecting the best site for 
bronchoscopy or percutaneous sampling.
Bacterial infections, particularly due to Gram‑negative 
bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Klebsiella species, as well 
as Staphylococcus aureus, are fairly common within the 
first month after transplantation.[5] CT may show patchy 
and confluent consolidation with air bronchograms and 
multifocal tree‑in‑bud nodularity [Figure 7].[5]
Fungal infection is a common pulmonary complication 
of lung transplant. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most 
common cause of fungal pneumonia and can also cause 
airway infections. It is frequently difficult to differentiate 
colonization from true invasive disease. Infection may 
lead to ulcerative tracheobronchitis, anastomotic infection, 
or angioinvasive fungal infection with solid nodules 
demonstrating the halo sign [Figure 8]. Candidal infections 
can be seen early in the postoperative course and can cause a 
range of abnormalities including pneumonia, mediastinitis, 
and esophagitis. Besides multifocal mass‑like consolidation, 
nodules may also be seen.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis is the most 
common manifestation of CMV infection and usually 
occurs between 1 and 6 months after transplant.[24] The 
incidence has decreased due to effective prophylaxis. The 
risk of infection is highest in seronegative recipients who 
receive seropositive donor lungs. Imaging features include 
geographic groundglass opacities with crazy paving 
appearance, septal thickening and bronchial wall thickening, 
and centrilobular nodules. Besides being associated with 
immediate morbidity and mortality, these infections are 
associated with development of bronchiolitis obliterans.[25]
Pulmonary thromboembolic events
The first few months following transplant surgery are 
associated with increased thrombogenesis related to 
increased perfusion of the allograft and arterial anastomosis. 
Since most CT imaging in the post‑transplant period is 
done without contrast to protect the kidneys in these 
patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, a high 
level of suspicion is needed to request a CT pulmonary 
angiogram [Figure 9A]. Development of embolism may be 
a catastrophic event in this population, leading to rejection 
and rapid decline in lung function [Figure 9B].
Secondary late complications (>4 months)
Chronic rejection
Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains the 
major late complication of lung transplantation, affecting 
at least 50% of recipients at 5 years. This complication can 
be seen in the first post‑transplant year in 7‑10% of patients.

smaller distal airways, is the hallmark of classically defined 
chronic rejection.[26] Risk factors include multiple episodes 
of acute rejection, infection, and gastroesophageal reflux. 
The diagnosis is established by pulmonary function testing 
and graded according to International Society for Heart 
and Lung Transplantation criteria, or by lung biopsy.[27,28]
Frequently, patients with CLAD may have a combined 
restrictive obstructive defect on pulmonary function 
testing and corresponding CT correlate such as apical 
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) and organizing 
pneumonitis.
Chest radiographs may show chronic airspace opacities 
with architectural distortion, patchy hyperinflation, 
subsegmental atelectasis, and bronchiectasis.[29] HRCT 
findings include bronchiectasis and bronchial wall 
thickening, mosaicism (mixed hypo‑ and hyperattenuation) 
and air trapping, nodular opacities, as well as distortion of 
bronchovascular structures. If there is a clinical suspicion 
for chronic rejection, paired inspiratory and end‑expiratory 
CT images can be acquired and compared to evaluate 
for air trapping due to bronchiolitis obliterans, though 
the sensitivity and specificity of this modality is limited. 
Presence of air trapping is a specific CT sign and strong 
correlate of bronchiolitis obliterans.[30]
Upper lobe fibrosis and PPFE
Progressive upper lobe fibrosis can be seen 1‑4 years after 
transplantation. Imaging findings include coarse septal 
thickening, reticular abnormality, traction bronchiectasis, 
honeycombing, architectural distortion, and loss of volume. 
Recently, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) has been 
described in patients with lung transplant and bone marrow 
transplant as a cause of restrictive allograft syndrome. This 
is characterized by apical pleural fibrosis and subjacent 
parenchymal fibroelastosis with a sharp demarcation 
between areas of fibroelastosis and uninvolved parenchyma. 
CT reveals severe pleural and subpleural thickening with 
fibrotic changes in the subjacent parenchyma with associated 
traction bronchiectasis and  honeycombing [Figure 10].
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis
Organizing pneumonitis can be associated with both 
acute and chronic rejection. It can be seen in patients with 
acute rejection, presenting as peribronchial, subpleural, 
or perilobular areas of consolidation, with architectural 
distortion [Figure 11].[31] Frequently, a reverse halo sign 
and arc‑shaped opacities may be seen. Bronchoscopy is 
an important step in the management of these patients 
to exclude infection before starting high‑dose steroids, 
following which there is often dramatic improvement in 
the pulmonary opacities.
Post‑transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
Post‑transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is 
uncommon and occurs in<6% of patients, with most common 
risk factors being immunosuppression with cyclosporine 
and Ebstein‑Barr virus infection.[32] Intrathoracic disease 
is most common in the first year after transplant, while 
extrathoracic disease is seen later in the post‑transplant

period. Early disease responds more frequently to antiviral 
therapy and reduction of immunosuppression, while late 
disease may require chemotherapy and irradiation.
MDCT and 18‑fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18F‑FDG PET/
CT) are well‑suited for evaluation of these patients. 
Well‑circumscribed pulmonary nodules or mass‑like 
consolidation can be seen on CT. Frequently, multistation 
mediastinal, hilar, and extrathoracic adenopathy is 
identified on cross‑sectional imaging [Figure 12]. Biopsy 
may be needed to differentiate infectious nodules from 
those secondary to PTLD, as well as to rule out other causes 
of malignancy besides PTLD. Extrathoracic disease may 
involve the gastrointestinal tract, skin, or oropharynx.[32]
Recurrence of primary disease
Sarcoidosis is the most commonly recurrent primary disease, 
at approximately 35%.[33] Lymphangioleiomyomatosis may 
also recur in the allograft. The imaging features are specific 
to the recurrent disease, and these findings may be seen 
anytime during the course of disease.
Transbronchial biopsy‑associated complications
Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy aids in the 
diagnosis of rejection and infection with low overall 
complication rates between 6% and 12%.[34] These include 
hemorrhage, pulmonary laceration, air‑filled cysts, 
pneumothoraces, and infection. Focal dense parenchymal 
opacities or consolidation may be seen at sites of biopsy, 
usually located within 2 cm of the pleura.[34]
Tailoring of MDCT protocols to clinical question
Most surveillance transplant chest imaging is done using 
chest radiographs and non‑contrast CT. Problem‑specific 
protocols should be utilized to answer specific clinical 
questions [Figure 12]. High‑resolution computed 
tomography (HRCT) images allow early and more 
sensitive assessment of interstitial thickening, reticulation, 
and bronchiectasis, all of which are imaging markers 
of rejection. In suspected chronic allograft dysfunction, 
end‑expiratory images should be obtained in addition to 
inspiratory images to assess for air trapping, an imaging 
marker for bronchiolitis obliterans. In patients with 
suspected dynamic airway narrowing or bronchomalacia, 
dynamic expiratory CT images should be obtained to 
look for abnormal compliance and collapsibility.[35] The 
3D reformations and curved planar reformats create 
a roadmap for the bronchoscopist and the surgeon 
for sampling of focal lesions and stent placement. 
Contrast‑enhanced CT angiogram is needed in patients 
with suspected pulmonary embolism and vascular 
anastomotic complications.
In patients with new nodules or mass and increasing 
adenopathy, PTLD as well as primary lung malignancy or 
atypical infection is a concern. FDG PET/CT is well‑suited for 
defining the extent of disease and selecting an appropriate 
site for tissue sampling [Figure 13].
Imaging also plays a key role in appropriate patient 
selection prior to lung transplant. While a chest CT is 
routinely done prior to transplant to rule out an active 
infection or developing malignancy in these patients, other 
tests are chosen based on the underlying disease such as

cystic fibrosis and autoimmune disease [Figure 14].
Conclusions
Post-lung transplant complications may have a wide 
spectrum of complex overlapping imaging appearances 
and these may frequently co‑exist. Correlation of the 
clinicoradiological features with time course since 
transplantation significantly helps in narrowing the 
differential diagnosis. Low threshold for performing CT 
is advised, as it can detect and characterize infection early 
in this immunosuppressed population as well as aids in 
directing attempts at tissue biopsy. Tailoring of CT protocols 
in patients with suspected chronic allograft dysfunction or 
suspected anastomotic complications increases the yield 
of imaging in defining accurate diagnosis. Imaging can be 
critical to patient management if there is a concern for more 
rare complications of transplant, such as torsion, dehiscence, 
size mismatch, and airway complications.
