Acute kidney injury predisposes patients to the development of both chronic kidney disease and end-stage 
renal failure, but the molecular details underlying this important clinical association remain obscure. We 
report that kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), an epithelial phosphatidylserine receptor expressed transiently 
after acute injury and chronically in fibrotic renal disease, promotes kidney fibrosis. Conditional expression 
of KIM-1 in renal epithelial cells (Kim1RECtg) in the absence of an injury stimulus resulted in focal epithelial 
vacuolization at birth, but otherwise normal tubule histology and kidney function. By 4 weeks of age, Kim1RECtg
mice developed spontaneous and progressive interstitial kidney inflammation with fibrosis, leading to renal 
failure with anemia, proteinuria, hyperphosphatemia, hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and death, analo￾gous to progressive kidney disease in humans. Kim1RECtg kidneys had elevated expression of proinflamma￾tory monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) at early time points. Heterologous expression of KIM-1 in an 
immortalized proximal tubule cell line triggered MCP-1 secretion and increased MCP-1–dependent macro￾phage chemotaxis. In mice expressing a mutant, truncated KIM-1 polypeptide, experimental kidney fibrosis 
was ameliorated with reduced levels of MCP-1, consistent with a profibrotic role for native KIM-1. Thus, sus￾tained KIM-1 expression promotes kidney fibrosis and provides a link between acute and recurrent injury with 
progressive chronic kidney disease.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid decline in kid￾ney function, often triggered by an ischemic or toxic insult. This clin￾ical syndrome is associated with substantial short-term morbidity, 
mortality, and cost, but it had previously been assumed that patients 
surviving the episode made a full renal recovery (1). However, AKI 
is now appreciated to be markedly associated with increased risk of 
future chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
(2, 3), and long-term mortality (4). The population rate of AKI is 
increasing at greater than 7% per year (5, 6), and some estimates indi￾cate that the incidence of AKI-related ESRD is equal to the incidence 
of ESRD from diabetes (7). The mechanisms that might explain the 
link between AKI and future CKD/ESRD are poorly understood, 
but peritubular capillary loss, a known consequence of AKI (8), is 
proposed to lead to chronic hypoxia and later development of tubu￾lointerstitial fibrosis and CKD (9, 10). How chronic ischemia might 
trigger parenchymal loss at a molecular level is unresolved.
Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), originally identified as hepa￾titis A virus receptor (HAVCR1, also known as Tim-1), is a type 1 
transmembrane protein strongly induced by ischemic and toxic 
insults to kidney. It also plays diverse roles in T and B cell biology 
(11). In healthy kidney, KIM-1 is undetectable, but after injury, 
it is induced more than any other protein, in which case it local￾izes to the apical surface of surviving proximal tubule epithelial 
cells (12). The extracellular KIM-1 Ig variable domain binds and 
internalizes oxidized lipid as well as phosphatidylserine exposed 
on the outer leaflet of luminal apoptotic cells (13, 14), thereby 
aiding in nephron repair and tissue remodeling through phago￾cytosis of cells and debris (15). KIM-1 is expressed in CKD (16–20) 
where it colocalizes with areas of fibrosis and inflammation (21), 
and its expression correlates directly with interstitial fibrosis in 
human allografts (22). Increased urinary KIM-1 is an indepen￾dent predictor of long-term renal graft loss and is also elevated in 
human nondiabetic, proteinuric CKD (23, 24). The expression of 
KIM-1 in chronic and progressive kidney disease, settings with￾out significant numbers of apoptotic cells in the tubule lumen, 
the epidemiologic association of AKI with future CKD (25), and 
the temporal and spatial association of KIM-1 with inflammation 
and fibrosis suggest that it might play a pathogenic role in link￾ing AKI to CKD and renal fibrosis.
In this study, we examined the functional consequences of 
chronic KIM-1 expression in renal epithelial cells. To dissociate 
the effects of KIM-1 expression from the pleiotropic effects of

ischemic kidney injury used to induce KIM-1, we created a genetic 
model in which KIM-1 is expressed chronically in the absence of 
any injury stimulus. Using this model, we demonstrate here that 
chronic KIM-1 expression leads to inflammation, tubulointersti￾tial fibrosis characterized by elevated monocyte chemotactic pro￾tein-1 (MCP-1) levels and a murine CKD phenotype. In contrast, 
mice with mutant endogenous KIM-1 were protected from fibro￾sis in a mouse model of CKD and had a reduced level of MCP-1. 
Together, these results indicate that persistent KIM-1 expression 
after AKI promotes interstitial fibrosis and correlates with MCP-1 
expression and further suggest that KIM-1 may represent a novel 
therapeutic target in CKD (26). The mouse model we have devel￾oped also recapitulates the renal and extrarenal manifestations 
of CKD seen in humans. These studies provide insight into how 
recurrent tubular injury, as reflected by persistent KIM-1 expres￾sion, might facilitate progressive CKD and lead to ESRD.
Results
To determine the kinetics of KIM-1 induction during fibrotic 
disease, we examined the time course for KIM-1 expression in a 
rodent model of renal fibrosis, unilateral ureteral obstruction 
(UUO). KIM-1 protein was strongly upregulated 2 days after ure￾teral obstruction and fell thereafter, but remained significantly 
elevated at day 14 (Figure 1A). KIM-1 was expressed on the api￾cal aspect of proximal tubule epithelia, in tubules surrounded 
by expanded interstitium with abundant interstitial smooth 
muscle actin–positive myofibroblasts (Figure 1B). To distin￾guish between KIM-1 expression as a cause or consequence of 
epithelial injury and fibrosis in vivo, we created a conditional 
Z/Kim1-AP transgene enabling Cre recombinase-dependent activa￾tion of KIM-1 and alkaline phosphatase (AP) expression (Figure 2, 
A–E). Crossing the Z/Kim1-AP mouse with Six2-GFPCre mice 
(hereafter referred to as Six2-GC) (27), generated bigenic Kim1RECtg
(Kim1 renal epithelial cell transgenic) mice with KIM-1 and AP 
expression in metanephric mesenchyme-derived kidney epithelia. 
Kim1RECtg kidneys expressed the Z/Kim1-AP transgene primarily in 
cortical and outer medullary epithelia, with rare transgene expres￾sion in inner medulla (Figure 2E and Supplemental Figure 1; sup￾plemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI45361DS1). Mosaic transgene activity was observed with 
10%–20% of renal tubules positive for AP activity, with a similar 
fraction of positive podocytes. Note, however, that despite the AP 
expression pattern, KIM-1 protein was only seen in tubules and 
never in podocytes (Figure 3C and data not shown). A comparison 
of the distribution of endogenous KIM-1 after UUO versus AP 
expression in Kim1RECtg kidneys is presented in Table 1.
Kim1RECtg mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios and 
expressed Kim1 mRNA at birth (Figure 3A). KIM-1 protein was 
properly sorted to the apical membrane of cortical proximal 
tubule epithelia (Figure 3, B and C). There was no difference in the 
birth weights of transgenic versus littermate control mice (n = 3 
Kim1RECtg or 7 littermate controls), but Kim1RECtg mice did not gain 
weight as quickly as littermate controls (Supplemental Figure 2). 
At birth, kidneys from Kim1RECtg mice were 23% smaller by weight, 
however, than those of littermate controls (Figure 3, D and E, 
P < 0.05, n = 5 Kim1RECtg or 13 control kidneys). This was associated 
with 43% fewer nephrons in Kim1RECtg kidneys without significant 
differences in glomerular diameter at P14 (Figure 3, F and G). Kid￾ney histology at P1 showed a mild reduction in cortical thickness, 
with occasional microcysts that appeared to be glomerular (about 
10% of total glomeruli; Figure 3H) and rare large cysts (fewer than 
1 per section). A detailed histologic analysis at P15 revealed nor￾mal glomeruli including foot processes, however (Figure 3, I and 
J), as well as normal interstitium and vasculature. Focal coarse 
vacuolization and focal epithelial degeneration were noted only 
in Kim1RECtg mouse kidneys (n = 3 Kim1RECtg and 3 control kidneys; 
Tables 2 and 3). These coarse vacuoles, suggestive of local inju￾ry, were found in about 1% of tubules (Figure 3, K and L). There 
were no histologic differences in other organs of Kim1RECtg mice 
when compared with organs from littermate controls (data not 
shown). Thus, P15 kidneys from Kim1RECtg mice were characterized 
by reduced nephron endowment and rare tubular epithelial vacu￾olization, but kidney histology was otherwise normal.
At 5 weeks, kidneys from Kim1RECtg mice developed a patchy 
mononuclear interstitial infiltrate with occasional hyaline casts and 
focal tubular damage. KIM-1 continued to be expressed in a subset 
of tubular epithelial cells along the apical membrane (Supplemen￾tal Figure 3). By 12 weeks, interstitial inflammation was extensive, 
together with tubular dedifferentiation, microcystic tubular dila￾tion, hyaline casts, and fibrosis. This inflammatory, tubular injury, 
and fibrotic phenotype was observed in all Kim1RECtg mice older 
than 6 weeks that were examined (Figure 4A and Supplemental 
Figure 4). In the oldest mice, prominent periarterial inflammation 
was present resembling ectopic lymph nodes. Tubular injury scores 
confirmed these histologic observations (Figure 4B). Serum creati￾nine was equal between transgenic and control mice at P14, but

rose progressively thereafter (Figure 4C), and kidneys from aged 
mice were shrunken with a cobblestone appearance typical of end￾stage renal fibrosis (Figure 4D). Kim1RECtg mice died spontaneously 
of progressive renal failure at a median age of 11 weeks (Figure 4E).
Immunohistochemistry and collagen stains confirmed early focal 
fibrosis surrounding isolated tubules beginning at 4 weeks, where￾as older mice exhibited extensive fibrosis, with abundant αSMA￾positive interstitial myofibroblasts and collagen fiber deposition 
(Figure 5A). In Kim1RECtg mice with established fibrotic disease, AP 
transgene expression was expressed in some, but not all, damaged and 
dilated tubules, consistent with transgene expression in 10%–20% 
of tubules (Figure 5B). We did not detect any interstitial cells that 
expressed the AP transgene, arguing against any direct contribution 
of injured epithelial cells to the myofibroblast population through 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and consistent with the 
notion that epithelia are not capable of contributing directly to the 
interstitial myofibroblast pool (28, 29).
Given the progressive kidney disease exhibited by Kim1RECtg mice, 
we looked for extrarenal manifestations of CKD. Cardiac hypertro￾phy often accompanies CKD in humans and is linked to the very 
high cardiac mortality associated with CKD (30). We performed 
cardiac ultrasound in Kim1RECtg mice at age 10 to 12 weeks, a time 
when the renal phenotype is well established. At this time point, 
there was no increase in the systolic blood pressure (Figure 5, E–I), 
nor was there an increase in the interventricular septal thickness, 
left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, or left ventricular poster 
wall dimensions in Kim1RECtg compared with littermate controls 
(Table 4). There was a significantly increased percentage frac￾tional shortening, consistent with increased cardiac contractility, 
which is likely a consequence of the anemia that the mice develop 
(Figure 5J). In contrast, Kim1RECtg mice that survived past 6 months 
of age had clear evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, measured 
as ventricular wall thickness-to-diameter ratio (Figure 5, C and 
D). If hypertension were the primary cause of the renal fibrosis in

Kim1RECtg mice then cardiac hypertrophy would have been expected 
to occur by the 10- to 12-week time point when renal injury and 
dysfunction were severe.
The presence of a normal blood pressure at 10 to 12 weeks is also 
consistent with the notion that hypertension was not simply a con￾sequence of reduced nephron endowment, because it did not pre￾cede the renal phenotype, but rather that hypertension was a conse￾quence of severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate (Figure 5E). 
The severe and progressive anemia developed by the Kim1RECtg mice 
(Figure 5F) was normocytic (mean corpuscular volume was not dif￾ferent between control and Kim1RECtg mice;data not shown). Late 
stages of CKD are characterized by hyperkalemia, hyperphospha￾temia, and hypoalbuminemia. Thus, Kim1RECtg mice displayed all 3 
of these characteristics in a progressive fashion over time (Table 5).
The phenotype is not a result of primary proteinuria, podocyte expres￾sion of KIM-1, or general toxicity of AP. Chronic proteinuria of any 
cause has been proposed to drive renal fibrosis. Kim1RECtg mice 
developed proteinuria after 4 weeks of age, subsequent to tubular 
damage and leukocyte influx (Figure 5G and Supplemental Figure 
5). Importantly, there was no proteinuria in Kim1RECtg mice at P14, 
when podocyte foot processes and glomerular capillary endotheli￾um were normal (Figure 3J). Since KIM-1 is not normally expressed 
in podocytes, we investigated whether the Kim1RECtg phenotype was

a consequence of delayed toxicity to podocytes from glomerular 
KIM-1 expression. Mice with KIM-1–AP expression exclusively 
in podocytes (bigenic Podocin-Cre;Z/Kim1-AP) had expression of 
AP activity in 55% of glomeruli in a focal pattern (Supplemental 
Figure 6) with histologically normal glomeruli (data not shown). 
There was no effect on kidney size, and mice did not develop pro￾teinuria even up to 6 months of age. Serum creatinine and hema￾tocrit have the same values as in littermate controls (Figure 5, 
I and J). Taken together, these observations show that renal fibrosis 
was not a secondary consequence of abnormal glomerular devel￾opment, early hypertension, or podocyte expression of KIM-1. 
We also evaluated the possibility that AP expression alone in 
Kim1RECtg mice might mediate kidney damage independently of 
KIM-1 (31). However, bigenic Six2-GC;Z/AP mice that expressed 
the AP transgene (without KIM-1) in nearly 100% of renal epithelia 
(Supplemental Figure 5) had normal renal histology, no protein￾uria, and normal serum creatinine, even in the case of aged mice 
(Figure 5I and data not shown).
Characterization of KIM-1–induced kidney inflammation. Since early 
inflammation was a prominent histologic feature in Kim1RECtg mice, 
we next sought to characterize this infiltrate at the earliest time 
that disease appeared, 4 weeks. There was no interstitial infiltrate at 
2 weeks, but CD3+ lymphocytes and F4/80+ macrophages and den￾dritic cells migrated into Kim1RECtg kidneys by 4 weeks, and their 
appearance correlated with increased interstitial cell proliferation at 
this time point (Figure 6, A–C). KIM-1 has recently been identified as 
an endogenous ligand for the activating receptor leukocyte mono￾immunoglobulin-like receptor 5 (LMIR5) (also known as CD300b), 
and binding of KIM-1 to LMIR5 promotes neutrophil influx regu￾lated by myeloid cells (32). However, there were no neutrophils at 
4 weeks in Kim1RECtg kidneys, and they were only observed at late 
stages of disease (Figure 6C and data not shown). CD3+ lympho￾cytes were located in a focal pattern at early stages, often adjacent to 
KIM-1–positive tubules (Figure 6D), suggesting that secreted fac￾tors from KIM-1–expressing cells might be responsible for recruit￾ing inflammatory cells to the kidney in Kim1RECtg mice.
Tubule damage is known to contribute to and be exacerbated 
by inflammation. We therefore tested whether tubular damage 
could be detected using urinary biomarkers at 4 weeks. Since 
KIM-1 itself undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in release 
of the soluble ectodomain that might have the capacity to send 
a proinflammatory signal itself (32), we measured urinary KIM-1 
levels. Even at 4 weeks, when disease was mild, urinary KIM-1 levels 
were higher in Kim1RECtg mice compared with controls, as expected 
(Figure 7A). Consistent with early epithelial damage, urinary 
N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was also increased at 4 weeks 
and increased further at 8 weeks (Figure 7B). We further measured 
the levels of cytokines and chemokines known to be activated by 
epithelial pattern recognition receptors that might mediate leu￾kocyte recruitment. We detected a strong upregulation of mRNA 
encoding a panel of cytokines capable of being secreted by epithe￾lial cells at 4 weeks (Figure 7C). Three of these cytokines, CXCL-1, 
MCP-1, and TGF-β, were upregulated at 2 weeks — a time point 
without evident histologic damage.
The inflammation observed in Kim1RECtg mice coupled with 
increased proinflammatory cytokine expression suggested the 
possibility that KIM-1 might directly regulate epithelial cytokine 
expression. To test this possibility, we stably expressed either vec￾tor alone (pcDNA-LLC) or KIM-1 (KIM-1–LLC) in LLC-PK1 por￾cine proximal tubule cells. The supernatant from these cultures 
was collected and assessed for cytokines. The supernatant from 
KIM-1–expressing, but not control, cultures showed significant 
elevations in the levels of TGF-β, MCP-1, and IL-6 (Figure 7, D–F).
We next asked whether conditioned medium from KIM-1–LLC 
cells might also induce chemotaxis. pcDNA-LLC and KIM-1–LLC 
cells were plated in lower wells of the Boyden chamber until conflu￾ency, then washed and incubated overnight with DMEM. 5 × 105
phorbol ester-activated U937 cells or primary mouse BM-derived 
macrophages (mBMDM) were added to the upper wells. After 
3 hours, cells that migrated through the filters were fixed, stained, 
and quantitated. In both cases, significantly more cells migrated in 
response to KIM-1–LLC medium compared with control (Figure 7, 
G and H). This effect could be largely abrogated by addition of a 
neutralizing anti–MCP-1 antibody (Figure 7I), consistent with the 
increased expression of MCP-1 detected in KIM-1–LLC supernatant.

Soluble fibronectin is a known inducer of proinflammatory 
cytokines in renal epithelial cells (33), and the KIM-1–express￾ing cell line had substantially elevated fibronectin expression 
compared with control cells. Moreover, in a third cell line that 
expressed a point mutant of a cytoplasmic tyrosine within a 
consensus phosphorylation sequence (Y350F), fibronectin levels 
matched those of control LLC-PK1 cells (Figure 7J).
These findings indicate that KIM-1 expression drives proinflam￾matory cytokine expression, suggesting a mechanism to explain 
enhanced leukocyte infiltration at early time points in the Kim1RECtg
mouse model. KIM-1 also drives fibronectin expression in LLC￾PK1 cells through a mechanism that requires cytoplasmic tyrosine 
Y350, suggesting that fibronectin upregulation may underlie the 
proinflammatory cytokine expression observed.
KIM-1 mutant mice are protected from renal fibrosis in the UUO model. 
The Kim1RECtg phenotype suggested that mice with mutant KIM-1 
might be protected from kidney fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, 
we analyzed mice carrying a deletion of exon 3 of the KIM-1 locus 
(Kim1Δmuc), resulting in an in-frame deletion of the extracellular 
mucin domain. This mutation results in a smaller KIM-1 poly￾peptide that is defective in KIM-1–dependent phagocytic func￾tion (34). When subjected to UUO injury, KIM-1Δmuc protein was 
upregulated, but as expected, it migrated faster on Western blot 
than native KIM-1, reflecting the absence of the heavily glycosyl￾ated mucin domain encoded by exon 3 (Figure 8A).
Both control and Kim1Δmuc mice (n = 10 each) were subjected to 
UUO and sacrificed on day 10. Kim1Δmuc mice had significantly 
reduced interstitial collagen deposition as well as reduced tubular 
injury scores (Figure 8, B–D). mRNA levels of the myofibroblast 
marker αSMA were also reduced in Kim1Δmuc mice, in addition to 
levels of collagen 1α1 and fibronectin (Figure 8, E and F). Taken 
together, these findings indicate that Kim1Δmuc mice are protected 
from renal fibrosis in the UUO model. Since proinflammatory 
cytokine levels were increased in Kim1RECtg mice and KIM-1 expres￾sion regulates MCP-1, TGF-β, and IL-6 secretion in vitro, we ana￾lyzed the same panel of cytokines in Kim1Δmuc kidney samples before 
and after UUO. MCP-1 levels were significantly reduced in Kim1Δmuc
compared with control at day 10 of UUO (Figure 8H), while other 
cytokine mRNAs were unchanged (data not shown). This result, 
combined with our previous data, strongly implicates MCP-1 as a 
mediator of KIM-1–dependent fibrosis in the mouse kidney.
Discussion
Resident kidney epithelial cells play an important role in detec￾tion of injury, regulation of the inflammatory and tissue repair 
responses, and mediation of interstitial fibrosis through paracrine 
mechanisms (35, 36). In this study, we hypothesized that KIM-1 
might regulate kidney inflammation and fibrosis when its expres￾sion is prolonged because: (a) it is upregulated very early after kid￾ney injury and is thus poised to serve as a sentinel of damage; (b) it 
is expressed in chronic fibrosing kidney disease, where it colocaliz￾es with areas of fibrosis and inflammation (21, 22); (c) it is a phos￾phatidylserine receptor and may function in a manner similar to 
that of Toll-like receptors that are known to regulate innate immu￾Figure 4

nity (15); and (d) blockade of KIM-1 by monoclonal antibodies in 
other inflammatory conditions reduces disease pathology (37–40). 
The progressive kidney inflammation and fibrosis observed in 
Kim1RECtg mice are consistent with this hypothesis and, combined 
with the extrarenal manifestations described here, establish the 
Kim1RECtg mouse as what we believe to be a novel rodent model of 
progressive CKD and implicate the KIM-1 protein as a target for 
antifibrotic therapy in man (26).
The lower nephron endowment in our Kim1RECtg mouse model 
most likely reflects activation of KIM-1 expression in metanephric 
mesenchyme with effects on kidney development. Low nephron 
number is a recognized risk factor for the development of hyper￾tension and possibly CKD (41). However, reduction in nephron 
number by 28%–40% results in no, or very mild, interstitial fibro￾sis, even at late time points of greater than 1 year in a number of 
models (42–45). In contrast, Kim1RECtg mice described here had a 
comparable degree of nephron reduction (43%), but all developed 
spontaneous fibrosis starting at 4 weeks of age, with progressive 
renal insufficiency, proteinuria, renal fibrosis, and death at a medi￾an age of 19 weeks. Further arguing against a direct role of reduced 
nephron endowment in the observed phenotype, hypertension, 
proteinuria, and cardiac hypertrophy did not develop until well 
after the onset of renal fibrosis, and directed expression of the 
Z/Kim1-AP transgene in podocytes alone had no phenotype.
The primary finding of the current report is that chronic KIM-1 
expression in renal epithelial cells directly causes interstitial inflam￾mation followed by progressive fibrotic renal disease. Our data sug￾gest that epithelial cells that express KIM-1 chronically may act in 
a paracrine fashion to recruit mononuclear cells to the renal inter￾stitium, setting up a proinflammatory cascade, ultimately leading 
to further tubule damage and loss of renal function. We observed 
an early influx of leukocytes in the Kim1RECtg mouse model associ￾ated with early elevation in the proinflammatory cytokine MCP-1, 
a potent cytokine that mediates mononuclear cell recruitment and 
parenchymal cell activation. In contrast, in the Kim1Δmuc mouse 
model, in which KIM-1–induced phagocytosis is impaired, we 
observed reduced levels of MCP-1 and a reduction in renal fibrosis. 
Finally, our observation that stable expression of KIM-1 in proxi￾mal tubule cells in vitro triggers MCP-1 release and macrophage 
chemotaxis is consistent with a model in which chronic epithelial 
KIM-1 expression causes epithelial MCP-1 release, triggering leuko￾cyte influx and ultimately kidney fibrosis. The results provided do 
not offer proof that MCP-1 is most important in triggering leuko￾cyte influx, though an important role for MCP-1 is supported by 
the observation that mice deficient in the major MCP-1 receptor, 
CCR2, are protected from renal fibrosis (46).
The recent finding that soluble KIM-1 ectodomain serves as a 
ligand for the LMIR5/CD300b-activating receptor on resident 
macrophages provides indirect support for a model in which 
KIM-1 regulates inflammation (32); however, it is unclear 
whether soluble KIM-1 is required in our model, since we 
observed proinflammatory cytokine secretion from epithe￾lia themselves. Similarly, further investigation is required to 
determine whether ligation of KIM-1 by apoptotic bodies, 
oxidized lipid, or some other unidentified KIM-1 ligand is 
required for proinflammatory signaling, analogous to the 
requirement of Toll-like receptor ligands for induction of 
inflammatory responses in macrophages (47).
The stimulus for sustained KIM-1 expression after AKI or 
during CKD requires further investigation. The most likely 
explanation is that AKI itself causes peritubular capillary rarefac￾tion (8), leading to chronic tubular hypoxia, which is a potent 
stimulus for KIM-1 expression (12). Chronic KIM-1 expression 
will promote further tubulointerstitial inflammation, capillary 
loss, and hypoxia, further inducing KIM-1 and creating a positive 
feedback loop of hypoxia and inflammation that culminate in 
tubulointerstitial fibrosis.
Our study suggests what we believe to be a novel role for chron￾ic KIM-1 expression in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and 
through activation of the innate immune system and leukocyte 
recruitment. In contrast, very early induction of KIM-1 after AKI 
may serve an adaptive function to clear apoptotic and necrotic cells 
and debris and thereby decrease the early response of the immune 
system at a site of tissue damage. Persistent KIM-1 expression is 
perhaps maladaptive through chronic uptake of cell toxic compo￾nents of the tubular lumen, thereby promoting chronic inflam￾mation and ultimately renal fibrosis. Thus KIM-1 may represent 
a novel therapeutic target in fibrotic kidney disease, and antago￾nizing KIM-1 signaling might ameliorate renal fibrosis in CKDs.
Methods
Mouse strains. A KIM-1 cDNA was inserted into the NotI site of the Z/AP
plasmid (48), and linearized Z/Kim1-AP transgene was introduced into 
FVB zygotes (Charles River Laboratories) by pronuclear injection. Three 
independent founder lines were obtained; all exhibited Six2-GC–dependent 
transgene expression, and the line with highest outer medulla and cortex 
transgene expression was selected for further analysis. The Z/Kim1-AP
transgenic was maintained on an FVB × C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory) 
mixed background.
Z/Kim1-AP transgenic mice were crossed with the Six2-GC Cre driver line 
(27) maintained on a CD-1 × Swiss Webster (Taconic) × C57BL/6J (Jack￾son Laboratory) mixed background. In other experiments, the Z/Kim1-AP

transgenic mice were crossed with the Podocin-Cre driver line (49). The Z/AP
reporter line was from JAX and was maintained on a 129/BL6 background. 
The Kim1Δmuc has been described (34). The Z/AP and Z/Kim1-AP mice were 
genotyped using β-Geo–specific primers. The Six2-GC allele was genotyped 
as described (29). The Podocin-Cre allele was genotyped using Cre primers. 
In all cases, littermate control phenotypes were compared. Littermate con￾trols were used for all mouse experiments.
Induction of renal fibrosis by UUO. Male BALB/c mice aged 8 to 10 weeks 
weighing 20–22 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice 
were anesthetized and the left kidney exposed by flank incision. The ureter 
was ligated at 2 points proximal to the kidney with 6-0 silk. Sham animals 
had kidney exposed, but ureter was not tied.
Tissue preparation and histology. Mice were anesthetized, sacrificed, and 
immediately perfused via the left ventricle with ice-cold PBS for 2 min￾utes. Kidneys were hemi-sectioned, and portions were snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen. Other kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 
4°C for 12 hours, processed, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned, and 
stained with PAS using standard procedures. Some kidneys were prepared 
for electron microscopy by glutaraldehyde fixation. Other kidneys were 
fixed in 4% PLP fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 75 mM L-lysine, 10 mM 
sodium periodate) for 2 hours at 4°C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and 
snap frozen in OCT (Sakura FineTek). PAS-stained paraffin sections were 
assessed by quantitative measurement of tubular injury in 10 individual 
high-power fields (magnification, ×400) per kidney. A percentage of the 
area affected was estimated for the number of necrotic cells, loss of brush 
border, cast formation, and tubule dilation and was scored as follows: 0, 0% 
to 5%; 1, 5% to 10%; 2, 11% to 25%; 3, 26% to 45%; 4, 46% to 75%, and 5, more 
than 76%. The fields analyzed in each section were selected at random, and 
evaluations were made in a blinded fashion.
Glomeruli were counted on PAS-stained sections from with the operator 
blinded to the genotype. Glomerular diameter was measured digitally, taking 
the average of glomerular width and height from individual glomeruli. The 
ventricular wall ratio was assessed by measuring both the dorsoventral and 
lateral ventricle diameters and dividing by the ventricular cavity diameter.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Cryosections of 
7-μm were mounted on Fisher Superfrost Plus (Fisher) microscope slides, 
air dried, and treated for immunofluorescence as described (50). Primary 
antibodies against the following proteins were used: KIM-1 was detected 
with rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody R9 exactly as described for 
both immunofluorescence and Western analysis (16); F4/80 (rat, 1:100, 
cat. no. 6640; Abcam); SMA (mouse FITC coupled, 1:200, cat. no. F3777, 
Sigma-Aldrich); DBA (lectin, 1:500, cat. no. L-1030; Vector Laboratories); 
Ki67 (rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000, cat. no. VP-RM04; Vector Laboratories); 
CD3 (rabbit monoclonal, 1:500 cat. no. VP-RM01; Vector Laboratories); 
and neutrophil (rat monoclonal, 1:100, cat. no. sc-71674; Santa Cruz Bio￾technology Inc.). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Dako. Sections 
were mounted in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vec￾tor Labs). Images were taken with a Nikon TE2000 microscope CoolSnap 
camera (Roper Scientific) and processed using IP Lab Software (BD Biosci￾ences). Immunofluorescence images were obtained on a Nikon TE2000 or a 
Nikon C1 D-Eclipse confocal microscope using standard procedures.
Immunohistochemical stains (αSMA, CD3, neutrophil, KIM-1) were 
performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 4-μM sections. Sections 
were rehydrated and antigens retrieved using heated citrate. Staining was 
visualized using horseradish peroxidase–coupled secondary antibodies 
(Vectastain Elite; Vector Labs). LacZ activity was measured by standard 
X-gal staining protocol on 7-μM frozen kidney sections that had been 
fixed in PLP for 2 hours and was carried out for 12–24 hours at 37°C; then

fuse if 50% or more of the tubule showed these changes. Semiquantitative 
analysis of glomeruli included glomerular histology as well as foot process 
morphology assessed by electron microscopy and was graded as follows: 
minimal: 1 (involving < 5% of glomerulus); mild: 2 (5%–24%); moderate: 
3 (25%–49%); and severe: 4 (≥ 50%). For assessment of glomerular involve￾ment, an average of 80–120 glomeruli per section were examined on multi￾ple levels. All scoring was done in a blinded manner by an experienced renal 
pathologist. Semiquantitative analysis of tubular morphology in Kim1Δmuc
mice was also performed in a blinded fashion exactly as described (51).
Electron microscopy. Portions of kidneys were fixed in Karnovsky’s fixa￾tive and processed for electron microscopic studies by standard proce￾dures. Semithin sections of each block were stained with toluidine blue 
sections were counterstained with eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) and mounted. 
PAS, H&E, and Masson’s trichrome stains were performed using standard 
techniques. AP activity was measured using NBT/BCPIP, with a standard 
protocol that included a 30-minute incubation at 60°C to inactivate 
endogenous AP activity.
Histologic analysis. Histological analysis was performed on paraffin-embed￾ded and serially cut kidney sections (3 μm) stained with H&E, PAS, and 
Masson’s trichrome. Analysis of tubules included the evaluation of epithe￾lial histology. The degree of injury was scored semiquantitatively on a 0 to 4 
scale for reabsorption granules, vacuolization, and epithelial degeneration 
as follows: 0, no lesion; 1, minimal (minor focal changes); 2, mild; 3, mod￾erate; 4, severe. The distribution was graded as focal if 49% or less and dif￾Figure 7

Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and 
examined by electron microscopy.
Western blot analysis. Kidney tissues were lysed, and lysates were prepared 
as previously described (50). Membranes were incubated with 1 or more 
of the following primary antibodies: rabbit antibody to LacZ (1 in 5,000; 
Cappel), chicken antibody to GFP (1 in 1,000; AVES), rabbit antibody to 
KIM-1 (1 in 250) (12), rabbit anti-fibronectin (1 in 1,000; Abcam), pro￾liferating nuclear cell antigen (1 in 1,000; Abcam) and ERK (1 in 1,000; 
Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies 
were applied, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) 
was used to detect proteins.

lected with a metabolic cage and processed in a similar fashion. MCP-1, 
IL-6, and TGF-β microbead-based assays were developed and validated 
in the lab. Approximately 6000 beads/50 μl were incubated with 30 μl 
of sample or recombinant proteins (R&D Systems) for 1 hour, washed 3 
times with PBST, and incubated in corresponding biotinylated antibod￾ies (R&D Systems) for 45 minutes on an orbital shaker at 300 rpm. Beads 
were washed again with PBST and incubated for 15 minutes with strepta￾vidin-PE solution (Invitrogen). The signal from the fluorochrome, which 
is directly proportional to the amount of antigen bound at the micro-bead 
surface, ws captured using the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad). Data were 
generated and interpreted using parametric logistic regression analysis.
Boyden chamber assay. Cell chemotaxis assay was performed in a modi￾fied Boyden chamber using 24-well flat-bottom tissue plates with 5-μm 
polyethylenterephtylan membrane inserts (BD). The lower compartment 
of each chamber was filled with 500 μl of the conditioned medium. Mem￾brane inserts were filled with 300 μl of cell suspension and placed in the pre￾filled lower compartments. The chambers were then incubated for 3 hours 
in 37°C, 5% CO2. After incubation, nonmigrated cells in the upper wells 
were removed by scraping and the migrated cells were stained with eosin on 
the membrane. Adherent cells on the lower surface of the membrane were 
counted from 5 high power fields by light microscopy (×40). Data are pre￾sented as cells per high-power field. Neutralizing antibody against MCP-1 
was from Sigma-Aldrich.

Physiologic measurements. Serum creatinine was measured using a Beckman 
Creatinine Analyzer 2 by the Jaffe rate method. Hematocrit was calculated 
after centrifugation of a hematocrit capillary tube. Proteinuria was assessed 
by the micro pyrogallol red method (total protein kit; Sigma-Aldrich) or by 
separation of 1 μl of urine on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by coomassie 
stain. Blood pressure was assessed by tail-cuff analyzer (Visitech Systems 
Inc.; Apex). After training conscious mice for 3 days, systolic blood pressure 
and heart rate were collected for 3 consecutive days between 9 am and 11 am, 
with an average of 10 reads each day. KIM-1 protein in urine was measured 
by microsphere-based Luminex technology. NAG in urine was measured by 
colorimetric assayed using a commercial kit (Roche). For serum electrolytes, 
BUN, and creatinine, mice were anesthetized and the blood samples were 
collected from carotid artery. Analyses were assessed by a core laboratory 
(Children’s Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA).
Cell culture. Cos7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 
(Invitrogen). Porcine proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) cells were 
grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and maintained at 37°C in 5% 
CO2. To create stable cell lines expressing full-length KIM-1 (KIM-1–LLC), 
LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3–KIM-1 or pcDNA3–KIM-1–
Y350F plasmid and the stable population was selected using G418 treatment 
(400 μg/ml). Control cell lines (pcDNA-LLC) stably expressing pcDNA3-neo 
were generated the same way. To generate mBMDM, femurs and tibias were 
removed from 20- to 25-g BALB/c mice. BM was isolated from these by stan￾dard sterile techniques and matured for 7 days in uncoated Petri dishes using 
DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin 
(100 mg/ml) and conditioned with M-CSF from L929 cells. The U937 cell 
line, a human monomyelocytic cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium 
supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM l-gluta￾mine. Cells were subcultured 3 times a week and maintained at a concentra￾tion of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml. Monocytic differentiation of U937 cells was 
achieved by adding 10 nM PMA for 48 hours. PMA-differentiated U937 was 
washed 3 times by sterile PBS before experiments.
Cytokine measurement. Both KIM-1–LLC and pcDNA-LLC cells were 
grown to confluence, and supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and
