Background: The SynCardia total artificial heart (TAH)® is the only approved TAH device. This report 
summarizes our single-center experience with the SynCardia TAH® with particular focus on the outcome 
after subsequent heart transplantation.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed the outcome of all transplanted SynCardia TAH® patients at our 
center between 2001 and 2019 in comparison to transplanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 
biventricular assist device (BVAD) patients and to transplanted patients without prior durable mechanical 
circulatory support (non-MCS). 
Results: Only a fraction (n=69; 37.3%) of all SynCardia TAH® patients (n=193) were transplanted. The 
majority (81.2%) of those were in high-urgency status at the time of transplantation. Survival in transplanted 
SynCardia TAH® patients was significantly poorer when compared to LVAD-, BVAD- and non-MCS 
patients (P=0.008). 
Conclusions: Heart transplantation in SynCardia TAH® patients requires distinct risk stratification to 
improve outcomes.

Introduction
Demographic factors and improving survival of patients with 
cardiovascular disease has seen an increase in the prevalence 
of heart failure (HF). In Germany, for example, the number 
of hospital referrals due to HF in individuals older than 
65 years has increased. In contrast, death rates due to HF 
have decreased from 63.7 per 100,000, to 42.8 per 100,000 
inhabitants per year in 2006 and 2016, respectively. This is 
primarily explained by improved therapeutic options (1,2).
Over the previous decade, the implantation of durable 
mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices has evolved 
towards a well-established treatment option for patients 
with therapy refractory terminal HF. The majority of such 
patients can effectively be treated with implantation of a left 
ventricular assist device (LVAD), yielding improved survival, 
quality of life, and exercise capacity, with relatively low 
complication rates (3,4). However, there is a certain portion 
of patients, probably further down the road of HF, with 
additional, significant dysfunction of the right heart (3,4). 
Durable biventricular MCS is a challenging task. Modern 
LVADs are not approved for right ventricular support, 
although expertise is slowly growing for the use of these 
continuous flow pumps in right ventricular assistance (5). 
Remaining approved options are the implantation of two 
paracorporeal Berlin Heart Excor® Systems for right and 
left ventricular assistance, or the SynCardia TAH®, which 
is the only approved total artificial heart (TAH) system. In 
smaller numbers of terminal HF patients with ventricular 
thrombosis, unfavourably small ventricular cavities, 
for example, in restrictive or concentric-hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathies, cardiac tumors or certain congenital

conditions, removal of the ventricular portions and 
implantation of a TAH is the only durable MCS option (6).
Although the SynCardia TAH® is completely implantable, 
it requires percutaneously guided air conduction tubes 
connected to an extracorporeal driver system. As it is a 
pneumatic system, both the “Companion”-driver for in￾hospital and the bulky “Freedom”-driver for ambulatory 
use produce noise which may disturb the patient and impact 
quality of life. Different to LVAD systems, malfunction of 
the device may lead to immediate death in SynCardia TAH®
patients. Therefore, the SynCardia TAH® is generally 
implanted with a bridge-to-transplant indication.
The aim of this report is to analyse the outcome of 
SynCardia TAH® patients after cardiac transplantation in 
a high volume MCS and heart transplant centre. Further, 
technological aspects of the demanding transplant procedure 
and the current significance of SynCardia TAH® therapy in 
terminal HF and transplant candidates are discussed. 
Methods
Study design and patients
In a retrospective, single-centre analysis, all patients 
receiving a left-ventricular (LVAD) or biventricular assist 
device (BVAD), a SynCardia TAH® or solely a heart 
transplantation without prior MCS therapy between 
January 2001 and December 2019 were analyzed, focusing 
on comparison of outcomes after heart transplantation in 
TAH patients. Written and informed consent for scientific 
use of clinical data was routinely obtained by all patients 
and their relatives (in case of unconscious patients). The 
investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Because of the retrospective study 
design, the need for an Ethics committee approval was 
waived. Baseline and postoperative patient characteristics as 
well as clinical follow up data of the patients were available 
through a prospectively maintained database of our MCS 
program. The primary endpoint was survival after heart 
transplantation during follow up. 
Statistics
Kaplan Meier survival estimates were calculated for all 
four patient groups. Cox regression analysis was used to 
compare clinical outcomes between the study groups. Data 
are given in absolute numbers, percentages, or mean values 
± standard deviation (range), as indicated. P values <0.05 
were considered statistically significant. We applied the 
statistical software package IBM SPSS, version 24 (IBM 
Corp, Armonk, NY, USA), R (version 2.15.3), and the SPE 
file in SPSS to perform the analyses.
Results
Retrospective data analyses revealed that n=193 patients 
were implanted with a SynCardia TAH® system at our 
center between the years 2001 and 2019. The primary 
indications for implantation are listed in Table 1. Ischemic 
cardiomyopathy was the leading diagnosis in SynCardia 
TAH® candidates. The number of implants per year 
declined over time (Figure 1).
A total of n=69 SynCardia TAH® patients were 
transplanted at our centre (37.3% of all SynCardia TAH®
implants) during the study period. The majority of 
SynCardia TAH® patients transplanted were categorized as 
Eurotransplant high urgency (HU)-status (81.2%), while 
fewer patients were transplanted in the regular transplantable 
(T) status (15.9%; Table 2). The mean time on SynCardia 
TAH® support was 303±198 days (1–733 days). 
During the study period, n=393 LVAD patients, 
n=70 BVAD patients and n=876 non-MCS patients 
were transplanted at our high-volume heart center. The 
actuarial survival per group after heart transplantation is 
depicted in Figure 2. Survival after heart transplantation was

significantly lower in SynCardia TAH® patients (P=0.008) 
when compared to the other groups. Survival after heart 
transplantation was not affected by the primary diagnosis 
at the time of SynCardia TAH® implantation (P>0.05). 
Multi-Organ failure was the predominant cause of death 
in approximately one third of all transplanted SynCardia 
TAH® patients (data not shown). Survival after heart 
transplantation was not significantly different between 
SynCardia TAH® (n=46), BVAD (n=44), LVAD (n=287) 
and non-MCS patients (n=686) who survived the 1st
 year 
after transplantation (Figure 3). 
Discussion
This study analyses survival after heart transplantation in 
SynCardia TAH® patients and shows impaired survival rates 
in these patients compared to patients transplanted after 
LVAD- and BVAD implantation and non-MCS transplant 
patients.
Obviously, SynCardia TAH® patients represent an 
especially risky patient cohort for cardiac transplantation. 
It seems logical, that the initial diagnosis at device 
implantation does not affect outcome after transplantation. 
In fact, as the heart is virtually completely removed 
during device implantation, only the systemic impact of 
the underlying disease could affect outcomes after heart 
transplantation in SynCardia TAH® patients. 
The Intermacs registry data on the TAH show better 
transplant rates and transplant outcomes in TAH patients 
compared to our single center analyses (6), which may be 
explained by our less liberal use of the TAH in durable 
MCS therapy. In addition, there is a dramatic lack of organ 
donations in Germany and different allocation policies. 
As a consequence of the latter, we handle relatively 
poorer donor organ quality, for example in view of donor 
age, which is an acknowledged risk factor for outcome 
after transplantation (7). In a prospective, investigator￾initiated trial, Copeland and coworkers reported superior 
1- and 5-year survival rates in transplanted TAH patients 
as herein of 86% and 64%, respectively (8). However, 
when interpreting these results, one has to acknowledge 
that, apart from potential donor organ quality matters, the 
study design was different to our “real world” retrospective 
analysis with distinct inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Obviously, there is a high mortality rate in transplanted 
SynCardia TAH® patients early post-transplant. But it is

interesting to note that after surviving the first 12 month 
posttransplant, long-term survival of these transplanted 
SynCardia TAH® patients parallels the outcome in 
transplanted LVAD-, BVAD- or non-MCS patients. Thus, 
heart transplantation may very well be a reasonable option 
after SynCardia TAH® implantation, but obviously requires 
vigorous risk stratification. It remains an open question, 
which SynCardia TAH® patients carry a high risk for early 
death and why the perioperative period is critical in these 
patients? In-fact, listing for heart transplantation mandates 
a “transplantable” condition generally in all candidates. In 
Germany, the high-urgency status is warranted in MCS 
patients, only if life-threatening complications of the MCS 
device occur, e.g. infection or thrombosis of the device. 
One could argue that the majority of SynCardia TAH®
patients are transplanted in HU-status, thus being in worse 
condition, but this holds true also for all other patient 
groups due to the dramatic organ shortage. In other words, 
there is an as-yet undefined significant risk in TAH patients 
during heart transplantation directly linked to this TAH 
technology. 
SynCardia TAH® cannot be completely evaluated for 
transplantation. For example, the device does not allow 
for direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures 
and pulmonary resistance, since trans-ventricular passage 
with a pulmonary artery catheter is not possible. Maybe 
modern tools for indirect measurements, such as the 
CardioMEMS®, may potentially help to uncover high-risk 
conditions such as significant pulmonary vascular disease 
prior to transplant (9).
Another critical aspect to the success of transplant after 
the SynCardia TAH® is the surgical procedure for device 
implantation. In our experience, formation of adhesive 
tissues after SynCardia TAH® implantation is excessive 
and is distinctively worse than after LVAD implantation. 
Although this notion cannot be supported by conclusive 
data analyses, we noticed tremendous thickening of the 
pericardium, most probably as an inflammatory reaction to 
the particular device. This is not regularly met in transplant 
candidates with other MCS devices. As a consequence, we 
perform SynCardia TAH® implantation with intensive 
coverage of all device parts with a synthetic Goretex®
membrane (10,11). It is recommended that all vascular 
structures shall be covered in order to avoid adhesions and 
to facilitate device explantation and transplantation (11). 
Further, the shape of the SynCardia TAH® device is 
significantly different from a native heart and therefore the 
intra-mediastinal adhesive changes complicate imbedding of 
the heart graft. Extensive pericardial and pleural resection 
may be necessary.
In addition, the time-consuming surgical preparations 
may lead to prolonged cold and warm ischemic times. 
As such, thorough logistical planning and performance 
is absolutely required when transplanting a Syncardia 
TAH® patient. It remains to be determined whether 
artificial machine perfusion during organ procurement and 
transportation may be helpful to reduce ischemic times and 
allow for extended recipient preparations, thus improving 
outcomes (12).
In summary, implantation of the SynCardia TAH®
system should only be undertaken where clearly indicated 
and other durable MCS devices are not suitable, as long￾term survival in our series was poorer in TAH patients 
when compared to other MCS and non-MCS patients. The 
less favorable quality of life and adverse event profile of the 
system must be considered when scheduling patients for 
the bridge-to-transplant. The latter and the better survival 
on other durable MCS devices make the SynCardia TAH®
inadvisable for destination therapy. Heart transplantation 
in SynCardia TAH® patients must be carefully planned, 
with particular attention paid to the TAH implant 
procedure, mid-term surveillance and transplant surgery. 
TAH implantation should preferably be performed in 
centers with an experienced high-volume MCS and heart 
transplant program (6). TAH implantation and subsequent 
heart transplantation requires distinct risk stratification to 
improve outcomes.
