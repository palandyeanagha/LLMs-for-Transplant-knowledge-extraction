Carcinoma in Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency

ABSTRACT: Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AT) deficiency is the most com￾mon genetic cause of liver disease in children. In addition to chronic
liver inflammation and injury, it has a predilection to cause hepato￾cellular carcinoma later in life. The deficiency is caused by a mutant
protein, ATZ, which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in
a polymerized form rather than secreted into the blood in its mono￾meric form. The histologic hallmark of the disease is ATZ-containing
globules in some, but not all, hepatocytes. Liver injury results from
a gain-of-toxic function mechanism in which mutant ATZ retained in
the ER initiates a series of pathologic events, but little is known about
the mechanism by which this leads to carcinogenesis. Several recent
observations from my laboratory have led to a novel hypothetical
paradigm for carcinogenesis in AT deficiency in which globule￾containing hepatocytes are “sick,” relatively growth suppressed, but
also elaborating trans-acting regenerative signals. These signals are
received and transduced by globule-devoid hepatocytes, which, be￾cause they are younger and have a lesser load of accumulated ATZ,
have a selective proliferative advantage. Chronic regeneration in the
presence of tissue injury leads to adenomas and ultimately carcino￾mas. Aspects of this hypothetical paradigm may also explain the
proclivity for hepatocarcinogenesis in other chronic liver diseases,
including other genetic diseases, viral hepatitis, and nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis. (Pediatr Res 60: 233–238, 2006)
Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AT) is the principal blood-borne in￾hibitor of neutrophil elastase, a protease that can destroy
the connective tissue matrix of the lung (1). It is considered a
hepatic acute phase reactant because it is secreted by liver
cells and its plasma levels increase during the host response to
tissue injury/inflammation. The classic form of AT deficiency,
which affects one in 1800 to 2000 livebirths, is associated with
a mutant molecule termed ATZ that is retained in the ER of
liver cells rather than secreted into the blood and body fluids.
The mutation is thought to alter the usual folding pathway and
to increase the likelihood that the protein polymerizes (2,3).
Homozygotes are predisposed to premature development of
pulmonary emphysema by a loss-of function mechanism in
which the lack of AT in the lung permits uninhibited proteo￾lytic damage to the connective tissue matrix (4,5). Cigarette
smoking markedly increases the risk and rate of development
of emphysema (6), presumably because of functional inacti￾vation of residual AT by phagocyte-derived active oxygen
intermediates. Other environmental factors and genetic traits
also play a role in the variation in incidence and severity of
lung disease among AT-deficient individuals (7).
Homozygotes are also at risk of liver disease. Indeed, AT
deficiency is the most common genetic cause of liver disease
in children (1) and also predisposes adults to chronic hepatitis
and hepatocellular carcinoma (8). Further, the predilection for
hepatocellular carcinoma among AT-deficient individuals is
significantly greater than that attributable to cirrhosis alone
(8). In contrast to the pathobiology of lung disease, liver injury
in this deficiency involves a gain-of-toxic function mechanism
whereby accumulation of the mutant ATZ molecule in the ER
triggers a series of events that are eventually hepatotoxic.
Evidence for the gain-of-toxic function mechanism comes
from studies in which mice transgenic for the mutant human
ATZ gene develop liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma
(9,10). Because there are normal levels of antielastases in
these mice, as directed by endogenous genes, the liver injury
cannot be attributed to a loss-of-function mechanism.
Studies by Sveger (11,12) in which every newborn in
Sweden was screened for AT deficiency and then followed for
30 y have demonstrated the extraordinary variation in phe￾notypic expression of liver disease among homozygotes .
These studies indicated that only 8 –10% of this population
developed clinically significantly liver disease over the first
20 y of life. These data indicate that other genetic traits and/or
environmental factors predispose a subgroup of homozygotes
to liver injury or protect the remainder of the population from
liver disease.
The histopathologic hallmark of the disease is intracellular
globules in hepatocytes that stain with periodic acid–Schiff
(PAS) after treatment with diastase. Early studies showed that
these globules represent mutant ATZ in the ER of liver cells.
Although these globules have been a focus of previous studies,
there has been very limited investigation of the curious fact
that many hepatocytes in these patients do not have globules.
Studies of the Z#2 mouse model, generated by using a human
ATZ genomic fragment as transgene, have shown that these

globule-devoid cells occupy an increasing proportion of the
liver as the animal ages and ultimately become the site of
adenomas and carcinomas (13). In more recent studies using
the PiZ mouse model, another transgenic mouse created with
a human ATZ genomic fragment, we have shown that there is
increased proliferation of these globule-devoid hepatocytes at
a rate that is directly proportional to the number of globule￾containing hepatocytes (14). These observations have led to a
novel paradigm in which the globule-containing hepatocytes
engender a cancer-prone state by surviving with intrinsic
damage and by chronically stimulating “in trans” adjacent
relatively undamaged globule-devoid hepatocytes that have a
selective proliferative advantage. The paradigm also appears
to be relevant to the mechanism by which other chronic liver
diseases are predisposed to hepatic cancer.
MOLECULAR BASIS OF THE CLASSICAL FORM
OF AT DEFICIENCY
The ATZ molecule is characterized by a point mutation that
results in the substitution of lysine for glutamate 342, and this
mutation accounts for its defective secretion. By adding a
bulky side chain at the base of the reactive loop “scaffold,”
this substitution is thought to interfere with relaxation of the
reactive loop into a gap in the A sheet of the AT molecule and,
thereby, to increase the likelihood of polymerization by a
mechanism in which reactive loops of adjacent ATZ mole￾cules can insert into the gap in the A sheet, the so-called
loop-sheet insertion mechanism (15,16). This tendency to
polymerize has been substantiated by observing polymers in
the ER of liver cells by rotary electron microscopy of liver
biopsy specimens from a patient with AT deficiency (16).
Several studies have suggested that polymerization of ATZ
is the cause of its retention in the ER, including most notably
studies in which secretion of ATZ is partially corrected by
introduction of a second mutation that suppresses loop-sheet
polymerization (17,18). However, these studies cannot ex￾clude the possibility that retention is caused by a distinct
abnormality in folding that is also partially corrected by the
second, experimentally introduced mutation. Indeed, several
recent observations militate against the idea that polymeriza￾tion is the cause of ER retention. First, naturally occurring
variants of AT in which the carboxyl terminal tail of AT is
truncated, including a double mutant with the substitution that
characterizes the Z allele and the substitution that results in
carboxyl terminal truncation, are retained in the ER even
though they do not polymerize (19). Second, only 18% of the
intracellular pool of ATZ at steady state is in the form of
polymers in model cell lines characterized by marked ER
retention (19,20). This is because most of the cellular pool of
ATZ in the ER in vivo is in heterogeneous, soluble complexes
with multiple ER chaperones (19), a state that cannot be
modeled by studies of purified ATZ in vitro. These observa￾tions suggest the possibility that polymerization of ATZ in the
ER is an effect rather than a cause of the retention. As an
effect, polymerization may still be very important in determin￾ing how ATZ is degraded, what cellular adaptive responses
are activated, and how retention of ATZ leads to liver injury
and carcinogenesis.
CELLULAR ADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO MUTANT
ATZ RETAINED IN THE ER
We now know that cells have elaborate mechanisms for
degrading mutant proteins that are retained in the ER. The
pathway, or pathways, by which retained ATZ is degraded is
also a candidate for genetic variations that predispose some
homozygotes or protect other homozygotes from liver injury
by the gain-of-toxic function mechanism. One study has pro￾vided a substantiation of this concept by showing that there is
a lag in ER degradation of ATZ after gene transfer into cell
lines derived from “susceptible hosts,” homozygotes with
liver disease, when compared with cell lines from “protected
hosts,” homozygotes completely free of liver disease (21).
Several different pathways appear to be involved in the ER
degradation of ATZ. The proteosomal system was implicated
first and has since been demonstrated in a number of different
model systems (22–26). Both the classic ubiquitin-dependent
and the ubiquitin-independent proteosomal pathways play a
role (24). However, it is still not entirely clear how the ATZ
on the luminal side of the ER membrane reaches the proteo￾some in the cytoplasm. Some luminal substrates have been
shown to traverse the ER membrane to reach the cytoplasm by
a retrograde translocation mechanism. However, the only
evidence of this mechanism as a part of the ER degradation
pathway for ATZ comes from the studies of Werner et al. (22)
in which ATZ could be detected in the cytosolic fraction of
yeast when the proteosome was inhibited, but it was only a
minor fraction of the ATZ that was undergoing degradation. A
mechanism in which the proteosome directly mediates extrac￾tion of substrates from the ER membrane, which has been
described for model ER degradation substrates (27), repre￾sents one possible alternative.
There are at least several nonproteosomal pathways that
contribute to ER degradation of ATZ as well (24). Cabral et
al. (28) have provided evidence for a nonproteosomal pathway
that is sensitive to tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. We have
shown that macroautophagy contributes to the disposal of
ATZ that is retained in the ER, using chemical inhibitors of
autophagy (29) as well as cell lines that are genetically
engineered for deficient autophagy (30). Macroautophagy is a
general stress-activated degradative mechanism whereby cy￾tosol and intracellular organelles are first enveloped by dis￾tinct, newly forming vesicles and then delivered to the lyso￾some for degradation. This process, which has been highly
conserved in evolution, is activated by starvation and bacterial
invasion and plays a role in differentiation, morphogenesis,
and senescense. Recent studies in autophagy-deficient mam￾malian cell lines (30) and autophagy-deficient yeast (31)
suggest that the autophagic response is particularly important
for insoluble polymers/aggregates of ATZ when there are high
levels of expression.
In addition to degradation mechanisms, cells appear to have
a number of other mechanisms by which they attempt to adapt
to, or protect themselves from, proteins that are retained in the
234 PERLMUTTER

ER. Because differences in an adaptive response could theo￾retically explain variation in the liver disease phenotype, we
have recently begun a series of studies designed to character￾ize how cells respond to ER retention of ATZ using cell line
and transgenic mouse model systems with tetracycline￾inducible expression of the mutant gene. These models permit
us to see the earliest responses and to separate them from
compensatory adaptations that arise later. Because the relative
expression of the mutant gene can be regulated in this kind of
model system, it is also possible to determine the effect of
expressing the mutant gene product at specific concentrations,
at specific stages of development and for specific time inter￾vals.
First, we found that accumulation of ATZ in the ER elicits
mitochondrial dysfunction (32). It has long been known that
mitochondria are closely apposed to the ER and recent studies
have shown that there are elaborate mechanisms by which the
ER and mitochondrion communicate with each other (33,34).
This mitochondrial injury was demonstrated functionally and
by detailed ultrastructural studies in the liver of affected
patients as well as in the model cell lines and transgenic mice.
It is not yet clear whether it is directly mediated by the ER
accumulation or indirectly results from an over-exuberant
autophagic response. Antagonism of mitochondrial dysfunc￾tion by administration of cyclosporine A is associated with
reduction in mitochondrial ultrastructural change, caspase-3
activation and liver disease morbidity in the PiZ transgenic
mouse (32). These data raise the interesting possibility that the
adaptive response actually contributes to liver injury by the
release of active oxygen intermediates that accompanies mi￾tochondrial dysfunction.
Second, we have found that accumulation of ATZ in the ER
is sufficient to activate the autophagic response. This was
demonstrated by mating two types of transgenic mice: the Z
mouse with liver-specific inducible expression of ATZ in
which ATZ accumulates in the ER of hepatocytes only when
doxycycline is removed from the drinking water (35) and the
GFP-LC3 mouse in which autophagosomes have green fluo￾rescence because LC3 is an autophagosomal membrane￾specific protein (36). Although green fluorescent autophago￾somes are only seen in the liver of the GFP-LC3 mouse when
it is starved, they are seen in the liver of the Z  GFP-LC3
mouse simply by removing doxycycline from the drinking
water and inducing the accumulation of mutant ATZ in the ER
of hepatocytes (29). This is a particularly important observa￾tion because it represents the first evidence that a single
protein can activate the autophagic response.
To our great surprise, accumulation of ATZ in the ER does
not activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is
a signaling pathway activating a number of genes in response
to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (37). In
addition to new synthesis of ER chaperones, such as BiP, and
enzymes that facilitate disulfide bond formation, bolstering the
protein-folding capacity of the ER, and lipids for synthesis of
new ER membrane required to handle the increased protein
load, an increase in synthesis of proteins that participate in
degradative and other cellular translocation mechanisms oc￾curs. There is also a decrease in initiation of translation in such
a way that only specific mRNAs can be translated and thereby
preventing the de novo synthesis of proteins that will further
accumulate in the ER (38). Although we do not detect acti￾vation of the UPR when ATZ accumulates in the ER, we do
detect it when truncated nonpolymerogenic AT mutants accu￾mulate in the ER, suggesting that it is the formation of
polymers in the ER by ATZ that suppresses the UPR (35). We
believe the lack of UPR signaling in response to the accumu￾lation of ATZ in the ER is a very important part of the
mechanism of carcinogenesis; activation of UPR signaling
might be expected to lead to cell death, and lack of UPR
signaling would permit survival of cells that have accumulated
ATZ, the so-called sick but not dead, globule-containing
hepatocytes (see below).
In contrast, the ER overload pathway and its signature
target nuclear factor-B (NF-B) are activated when ATZ
accumulates in the ER (35). The ER overload pathway was
first described as activation of the transcription factor NF-B
in response to the type of “ER stress” that is generated by
treatment of cells with brefeldin A or by experimental accu￾mulation of adenovirus E3 protein in the ER (39). The fact that
ER accumulation of ATZ activates NF-B but not the UPR
provides strong corroborating evidence of the previously held
contention that the ER overload pathway was distinct from the
UPR (39). Activation of NF-B has potentially important
implications for target organ injury in AT deficiency. First,
through NF-B, accumulation of ATZ in liver cells and
respiratory epithelial cells (40) could mediate inflammation in
the liver and the lung, particularly neutrophil infiltration in
response to the NF-B target interleukin-8. Second, activation
of NF-B has been shown to play a key role in inflammation￾associated carcinogenesis (41– 43) and therein could be in￾volved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma in AT
deficiency.
We also examined two other signal transduction pathways
that have been associated with ER stress. For one, we found
that ER accumulation of ATZ led to cleavage/activation of the
ER caspases: caspase-12 in mouse cells and caspase-4 in
human cells (35). These results indicate that both the mito￾chondrial and ER caspase pathways are activated in AT
deficiency. For another, we found that accumulation of ATZ
in the ER specifically mediated cleavage/activation of BAP31
(35), an integral membrane protein of the ER that is involved
in the ER retention of several proteins (44) and appears to
mediate proapoptotic signals from the ER to mitochondria
(45). This last result may provide a mechanistic basis for the
mitochondrial dysfunction that was recently found in cell line
and transgenic mouse models as well as in the liver of
deficient patients (32).
HEPATIC INJURY AND REGENERATION IN A
MOUSE MODEL OF AT DEFICIENCY
To begin to understand how the liver is injured and how it
regenerates in AT deficiency, Rudnick et al. (14) used the PiZ
mouse model of AT deficiency and measured the degree of
injury by BrdU labeling to quantify hepatocellular prolifera￾tion. These studies showed that there was increased hepato￾HARVEY R. COLTEN SYMPOSIUM LECTURE 235

cellular proliferation in the liver of the PiZ mouse at baseline.
Although the increase was five- to 10-fold above the controls
and highly statistically significant, there was still a relatively
low number of BrdU-positive hepatocytes at one time (2% to
3% detected over 72 h of continuous labeling). These data
indicate that liver injury in the mouse model is relatively mild
and appropriately corresponds to the smoldering and slowly
progressing liver disease that is seen in most AT-deficient
patients. The increase in hepatocellular proliferation was en￾tirely accounted for by male mice and correlated with in￾creased number of hepatocytes that had PAS-positive, dia￾stase-resistant globules as well as increased steady state levels
of AT mRNA and protein. Systemic administration of testos￾terone to female PiZ mice led to an increase in number of
globule-containing hepatocytes, steady-state levels of AT
mRNA and protein, and an increase in BrdU labeling that was
comparable to that in male PiZ mice. These results were
consistent with those of previous studies showing that andro￾gens had a positive regulatory effect on the human AT gene;
in this mouse, that would represent a positive regulatory effect
on the human transgene. However, more importantly, these
results indicated that the increase in hepatocellular prolifera￾tion in the PiZ mouse liver was proportional to the number of
globule-containing cells and/or the level of ATZ accumulation
within these cells.
Next, double labeling for PAS-staining and BrdU-staining
was used to determine whether the globule-containing or the
globule-devoid cells were proliferating. The results showed
that almost all the BrdU-positive cells in the PiZ mouse liver
were globule devoid and, conversely, very few of the globule￾containing cells were BrdU positive. These results provided
evidence that the globule-devoid hepatocytes have a selective
proliferative advantage in the PiZ liver.
To further characterize this selective proliferative advan￾tage, the hepatocellular proliferative response to partial hep￾atectomy in the PiZ mice was determined. Although partial
hepatectomy resulted in increased mortality among PiZ mice
as compared with their C57/BL6 nontransgenic littermates,
those PiZ mice that survived had a similar proliferative re￾sponse to the C57 littermates. In particular, there was a
comparable increase in BrdU labeling of globule-containing
and globule-devoid hepatocytes. These data indicated that the
block in proliferation of globule-containing cells is relative;
that is, when the stimulus was as powerful as the one that
follows partial hepatectomy, those cells were able to replicate.
Finally, these studies showed that there was increased
caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in the PiZ mouse liver.
Together with the observation that the liver-to-body-weight
ratio in PiZ mice was identical to that observed in wild-type
mice, these data suggested that hepatocytes undergo pro￾grammed cell death at a rate equivalent to the rate of increased
cellular proliferation. However, increased apoptosis was not
detected either histologically or by TUNEL staining in the
livers of these animals. Thus, the increase in cell death that
must be occurring in the PiZ mouse liver is at a rate that is
lower than the limits for detection of apoptosis using currently
available in situ methods. This is, again, consistent with the
slowly progressing nature of the disease. Most informative,
however, is the lack of apoptosis histologically and by
TUNEL staining of cells that obviously have globules. If we
take this together with our data on how cells respond to
accumulation of ATZ, we would suggest that the globule￾containing cells are “sick but not dead”—they have activated
ER- and mitochondrial-caspases, NF-B, and autophagy with
a relative block in proliferation, but they are not apoptotic.
A NOVEL HYPOTHETICAL PARADIGM FOR
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IN
AT DEFICIENCY
These data have led to a hypothetical paradigm in which the
accumulation of ATZ in the ER activates ER and mitochon￾drial caspases, NF-B, and autophagy, but the caspase path￾way is blocked at terminal steps so the globule-containing
hepatocytes are “sick but not dead.” An “injury/regeneration”
signal is generated by these cells in proportion to the amount
of ATZ accumulation per cell or the number of cells with ATZ
accumulation. Hepatocytes with lesser amounts of ATZ, glob￾ule-devoid hepatocytes are therein chronically stimulated
“in trans” to divide. The cancer-prone state is then engendered
by having cells that are unable to die at the appropriate time
and cells that are chronically dividing in an inflamed milieu.
The paradigm anticipates that some of the globule-containing
hepatocytes eventually die, but, because the block in their
proliferation is relative, they can be replenished, at least to the
extent that there are always some of these cells present in the
affected liver. The mechanism by which globule-devoid hepa￾tocytes arise in unknown, but one possibility is that they are
progenitors or relatively young cells for which there has not
been enough time to accumulate as much ATZ. Furthermore,
because of the proliferative advantage, it would presumably
only take one or a few of these to ultimately lead to many
more.
This model is consistent with the observations of Geller et
al. (13), using the Z#2 transgenic mouse model of AT defi￾ciency. These authors found that increasing areas of the liver
were negative for AT immunostaining as the mice aged so
that by age 12 mo, 90% of the liver was AT negative,
corresponding to the globule-devoid hepatocytes. Moreover,
by 6 mo, adenomas began developing in the AT-negative
areas and by 18 mo, 80% of these mice had hepatocellular
carcinoma arising within the AT-negative areas (13,46).
Why adenomas and carcinomas arise rather specifically
from the AT-negative regions is not clear. There are many
possible explanations. Certainly, this is where the most rapid
cell proliferation is occurring. The known antitumorigenic
effect of autophagy, which is relatively specifically activated
in the globule-containing hepatocytes of the PiZ mice and
PIZZ patients (29), also may play a role (47,48).
The mechanism by which the caspase pathway is blocked in
globule-containing hepatocytes is not known, but one possi￾bility is the antiapoptotic effect of heat shock proteins (49).
We have shown that accumulation of ATZ leads to an increase
in expression of several heat shock proteins (50).
A similar model may be involved in the mechanism of
hepatocarcinogenesis in the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase￾236 PERLMUTTER

deficient (FAH) mouse model of tyrosinemia (51). In these
studies, the liver of the FAH mouse was found to contain
hepatocytes that were damaged but not dead. In fact, these
cells were found to be resistant to cell death and, therefore,
prone to carcinogenesis. By the paradigm proposed here, these
hepatocytes would be considered equivalent to the globule￾containing hepatocytes in the PiZ mouse liver. They are
damaged by an entirely different mechanism than the globule￾containing hepatocytes, and the damage is much more severe
and rapidly progressing. However, they share the property of
being TUNEL-negative, and up-regulation of antiapoptotic
heat shock proteins has also been implicated in the block in
their cell death (51). There is also evidence in the FAH mouse
of chronic stimulation in “trans” of hepatocytes that are not
damaged and have a selective proliferative advantage. Ac￾cording to the paradigm we are proposing here, these hepato￾cytes correspond to the globule-devoid hepatocytes in the PiZ
mouse liver. The mechanism by which some undamaged
hepatocytes arise in the FAH mouse as well as in tyrosinemic
patients is known and appears to involve mutation reversion
(52), whereas the origin/mechanism of globule-devoid hepa￾tocytes in the PiZ mouse and AT-deficient patient is still
unknown. Evidence of a “trans” effect in the FAH mouse
comes from studies with transplanted normal hepatocytes that
are capable of undergoing multiple rounds of replication in the
FAH mouse liver but only if disease is present. Once the
mouse is given the drug NTBC, which prevents the accumu￾lation of toxic intermediates in the damaged cells, transplanted
hepatocytes will no longer replicate in the FAH mouse liver
(53). However, at least one part of this paradigm does not fit
with what has been found in humans with hereditary tyrosine￾mia, which is that dysplasia and carcinoma have only been
found to arise from the damaged cell compartment (54). It is
possible that this difference relates to the net balance of
carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic factors in each compart￾ment in the two different diseases. For instance, activation of
NF-B and of autophagy is present in the damaged cell
compartment in the AT deficiency models but not in the
tyrosinemia model.
A similar situation has been described for hepatocarcino￾genesis in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) transgenic
mice (55). In this model of hepatitis B–associated liver injury,
like the PiZ model, the degree of hepatocellular proliferation
correlated with the presence of injury and carcinomas and
with the cellular load of HBsAg, but the proliferating cells,
adenomas, and carcinomas had significantly lesser amounts of
retained HBsAg. However, because this transgenic model
only expresses HBsAg and not complete hepatitis B virus, it is
not clear whether the model truly reflects hepatocarcinogen￾esis in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. It is of some interest
that HBsAg is known to be selectively retained in the ER of
hepatocytes, and this process is thought to be responsible for
the so-called ground glass hepatocyte (56). Prolonged ER
retention has also been observed for several proteins encoded
by hepatitis C virus in infected hepatocytes (57), raising the
possibility that a similar paradigm applies to cancer predispo￾sition in hepatitis C infection. Several studies have shown an
increase in the proliferation of hepatocytes with lesser loads of
fat accumulation in mouse models of obesity-related hepatic
steatosis (58). Moreover, these cells have some of the staining
characteristics of a type of progenitor cell known as the oval
cell (59). Thus, the paradigm in which hepatocarcinogenesis
involves cross-talk between inappropriately surviving, dam￾aged cells and younger cells with a selective proliferative
advantage may be applicable to chronic liver disease due to
viral infections or associated with obesity in addition to
genetic liver disease.
