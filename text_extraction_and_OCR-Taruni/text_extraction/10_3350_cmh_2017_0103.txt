INTRODUCTION 
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a type of non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can silently lead to progressive liv￾er damage, hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension and cirrhosis 
sometimes further complicated by primary liver cancer.1
 The con￾dition can be clinically silent for years until it presents suddenly 
with variceal bleeding or new onset fluid retention such as ascites 
or hydrothorax. Based on the fundamental pathophysiological 
mechanisms involved in disease progression which centers on 
poorly controlled lipid peroxidation or fat rancidification and its 
relationship to diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, several treat￾ment options have undergone clinical study including PUFA sup￾plementation (Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids or Omega 3 fatty ac￾NASH Therapy: omega 3 supplementation, vitamin E,

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the more aggressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH 
can progress to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and primary liver cancer. Therapy is evolving with a 
substantial number of trials of promising new agents now in progress. In this article however, we will examine data for 
several older forms of therapy which have been fairly extensively studied over the years: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid 
(PUFA) supplements, vitamin E, insulin sensitizing agents with a focus on pioglitazone and statin agents. Early interest 
in PUFA derived from their potential benefit in cardio-metabolic disease and the close association of NAFLD/NASH 
with Metabolic Syndrome. Results have been variable although most studies show reduction of liver fat without other 
major effects and their effects are influenced by concomitant weight loss and underlying genetic factors. Vitamin E 
has had some efficacy in pediatric NASH but questionable efficacy in even mild NASH among adults. Pioglitazone has 
shown significant histological benefit in a number of trials but concern over side-effects (especially weight gain) have 
dampened enthusiasm. A newer insulin sensitizer, liraglutide, has also shown promise in a small randomized, controlled 
trial. Very limited data exists regarding the histological effects of the statins in NASH and these agents appear to be fairly 
neutral with neither clear cut benefit nor detriment. Their use is best guided by cardiovascular risks rather than liver 
histology. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2017;23:103-108)

ids) anti-oxidant therapy with vitamin E (tocopherols), insulin 
sensitization with anti-diabetic agents such as the ‘TZDs’ (thia￾zolidinediones) and, based on the association of NAFLD with dys￾lipidemia, there has been attention given to anti-cholesterol medi￾cations such as the statins. In this discussion, I will highlight some 
of the work in this area. 
OMEGA 3 FATTY ACID (PUFA, OMEGA-3, ‘FISH 
OIL’ SUPPLEMENTS)
PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) are important lipid nutrients 
which constitute key fatty acid components of the triglyceride/di￾glyceride and phospholipid membranes of cells and sub-cellular 
organelle membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the 
mitochondria.2
 The fatty acid composition of these phospholipid 
membranes influences susceptibility to free-radical induced oxida￾tive injury and to activation of inflammatory and anti-inflammato￾ry pathways through their metabolism to structurally related pros￾taglandins and leukotrienes. These agents also act as ligands for 
nuclear receptors to stimulate transcription of genes involved in 
lipid and energy metabolism.3
In the most straight forward perspective, PUFA can be seen as 
consisting of two nutritionally essential 18 carbon fatty acids 
which are usually ingested as components of ester links of three 
fatty acids linked to a three carbon glycerol backbone (i.e. triacyl￾glycerides or ‘triglycerides’): 1. Linoleic Acid 18:2 (9,12) also 
known as Omega 6 (N6) fatty acids and 2. Linolenic Acid 18:3 
(9,12,15) also known as Omega 3 (N3) fatty acids. The nomencla￾ture and biochemistry of these agents and their downstream me￾tabolites is remarkably complex. ‘Unsaturated’ refers to the pres￾ence of carbo-carbon double bonds (minus a hydrogen bond) 
with the number of double bonds indicated as 2 or 3 in the formal 
name and the indication of the position of the ‘first’ double bond 
from one terminal of the molecule: hence the terms ‘N3 or N6’. 
Note that N6 fatty acids have two double bonds and that N3 have 
three double bonds. They are considered ‘essential’ because the 
body cannot synthesize these fatty acids from other precursors. 
End products of their metabolism include short acting eicosanoids 
which consist of families of prostaglandins and thromboxanes 
formed through the activity of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase 
acting on fatty acids cleaved from the membrane bound phospho￾lipids attached to the 3 carbon glycerol backbone.
Through the activities of elongation and desaturation enzymes 
in the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria, N6 linoleic 
acid is converted to gamma lenolenic acid (GLA) which is further 
metabolized (elongated) to arachidonic acid 20:4 (5,8,11,14). N6 
PUFA are generally considered pro-inflammatory. Common dietary 
sources include corn products, safflower seed oil, soy bean oil, 
and sunflower seeds. In contrast to the N6 fatty acids, N3 Linole￾nic Acid is, by the same enzymes pathways, further elongated and 
desaturated to eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) which is further me￾tabolized to Docosahexanoic Acid (DHA). N3 PUFA are generally 
considered anti-inflammatory because of the properties of their 
downstream metabolic derivative eicosanoids. Common sources 
of the N3 fatty acids include fish oil, flax seed, canola, walnuts, 
and brasil nuts. 
Early interest in ‘Omega 3’ (N3) supplements as possible thera￾py of NASH can be traced to the close association between the 
metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance), cardiovascular disease, 
fatty liver and reports of the cardiovascular benefits of diets rich 
in omega 3 fatty acids.4-6 Interest was further stimulated by the 
possible role of skeletal muscle phospholipid membrane composi￾tion and insulin sensitivity where lower insulin sensitivity was as￾sociated with lower skeletal muscle PUFA content thought to rep￾resent myocyte phospholipid membrane composition.7
Subsequently, lipidomic studies of human fatty liver indicated an 
association between fatty acid related cellular injury and relatively 
diminished N3 fatty acids.8
 In addition, data has accrued which 
reveals the importance of fatty acids as key nuclear transcription 
factors which influence the expression of hepatic fat and energy 
metabolic pathways.9,10 These include PPAR receptors (peroxisome 
proliferator activated receptor), SREBP, CREBP, LXRα, FXR, RXR, 
HNF-4α all of which influence hepatic fat metabolism.
A number of trials of Omega 3 supplements have been con￾ducted in the treatment of human NASH. Some variation in results 
is likely explained by nuances of the trials including formulation of 
omega 3, duration and dose of the supplement, measured target 
endpoints, control for concomitant exercise and dietary changes, 
genetic and epigenetic background of the study subjects and fac￾tors as subtle as the pattern of supplement ingestion.11,12 None of 
the studies have shown improvement in key prognostic histologi￾cal features such as fibrosis. However, most but not all trials have 
shown reduction in hepatic fat content. Using biopsy as the mea￾sure of fat content, one study reported no change in steatosis af￾ter 12 months of a synthetic EPA supplement up to 2,700 mg/day 
compared to placebo treated subjects.13 In contrast, using MRS to 
provide a more global measure of liver fat content, the WELCOME 
trial reported significant hepatic fat reduction after 15-18 months 
of 4,000 mg/day of a synthetic mixture of EPA and DHA compared

to placebo (derived from olive oil).14 The reduction in liver fat was 
predictable by changes in erythrocyte N6-N3 phospholipid com￾position. Similarly, our own study of 12 months of 3,000 mg/day 
of a fish oil derived mixture of EPA and DHA versus soy bean oil 
placebo, showed reduced liver fat by the Dixon modified MRI but 
the effect was significantly less evident in patients who lost even 
a modest amount of weight during the study period.15 As reported 
by others,16 the effect was also influenced by the PNPLA3 geno￾type being greater among individuals with steatosis prone GG al￾lele. Because PUFA are more prone to oxidative injury than satu￾rated fatty acids, it is also notable that none of the trials have 
observed evidence of increased injury. 
Taken together, the effects of omega 3 supplements appear to 
reduce liver fat overall within a 1-2 year time frame but neither re￾duce nor exacerbate steatohepatitis. The effect is influenced by 
both the ability to lose even a modest amount of weight through 
diet and aerobic activity and by the underlying individual genetic 
background governing hepatic fat metabolism. Whether or not 
higher dietary ingestion of N3 fatty acids over a longer term (ie a 
lifetime) influences the course of fatty liver and NASH remains un￾certain but seems plausible. The effect may be mediated by skele￾tal muscle phospholipid metabolism although we could not detect 
a beneficial effect on exercise capacity.
VITAMIN E
Vitamin E constitutes a family of tocopherols and tocotrienols 
which have been studied over the years in the treatment of NASH 
based on their well-known anti-oxidant properties and the key 
role of lipid peroxidation in NASH pathogenesis.17 Most studies 
have used α tocopherol with somewhat variable results. In an 
early histology based trial, vitamin E (800 IU/d) combined with ur￾sodeoxycholic acid (12-15 mg/kg) with for two years versus single 
or double placebo controls showed histological improvement in 
the combination group.18 Favorable results were also noted when 
vitamin E was combined with vitamin C in an early clinical trial.19
The most significant effects have been seen in pediatric NASH 
patients. The TONIC trial randomized 173 pediatric patients to one 
of three groups for two years of therapy: vitamin E (800 IU/day) 
n=58, metformin (1,000 mg/day) n=57 and placebo n=58.20 Biopsy 
was the primary endpoint. Most were obese with evidence of in￾sulin resistance. The mean age was 13 years and 80% were male 
and 70% were Caucasian. The fibrosis stage was mild in all. Us￾ing one of the more reliable histological endpoints, the study 
demonstrated resolution of NASH in follow up biopsy in 28% in 
the placebo group, 41% in the metformin group and, significantly, 
in 58% of the vitamin E group. 
The results were less impressive in the companion adult trial of 
vitamin E among adults known as the PIVENS trial which random￾ized non-diabetic NASH patients to one of three groups: vitamin E 
(800 IU/day) n=84, pioglitazone (30 mg/day) n=80, and placebo 
n=83 for two years of therapy.21 The fibrosis was stage was mild. 
While it was one of the largest NASH trials at that time, the study 
has been criticized for its target population (very mild NASH in the 
absence of diabetes) and for problems with histological inclusion 
criteria (variable cellular ballooning) and its primary endpoint of 
reduction of the histological NAS (NAFLD Activity Score).22 A close 
look at the study results in terms of the more reliable endpoint of 
NASH resolution showed significantly greater efficacy of piogli￾tazone (see below) compared to vitamin E which was only mar￾ginally better than placebo: pioglitazone: 47% (P=0.001), vitamin 
E: 36% (P=0.05) and placebo: 21%.
Taken together, the data suggest that high dose vitamin E (800 
IU/day) appears to have some benefit in mild NASH among pedi￾atric patients but only a limited effect in adults. Concerns regard￾ing safety with the long term use of the agent23,24 and its limited 
efficacy have dampened enthusiasm although it is notable that no 
evidence vitamin E related adverse events were reported during 
two years of therapy in these trials.
INSULIN SENSITIZING AGENTS
Because of the close association of fatty liver with insulin resis￾tance and type 2 diabetes, there has been long term interest in 
the potential benefits of anti-diabetic, insulin sensitizing agents in 
NASH. Early studies of metformin, a biguanide which alters cellu￾lar bioenergetics through AMP-activated protein kinase,25 showed 
favorable effects in experimental rodent models of NASH but sub￾sequent human trials didn’t realize a substantial benefit although 
the lack of weight gain and usually good tolerance (aside from oc￾casional GI side-effects) have sustained interest in the agent 
among some practitioners.26,27 Much greater interest has been fo￾cused on the thiazolidinediones or TZD’s since the initial report of 
their use in NASH.28 These agents are ligands of the ‘gamma’ per￾oxisome-proliferator-activated gamma receptor (PPAR-γ) which is 
a nuclear transcription receptor activated by fatty acids and ex￾pressed in adipocytes, enterocytes and myocytes and influences 
expression of metabolic pathway components involved in lipid

and glucose metabolism.
Randomized and controlled trials, including the more recent 
PIVENS trial noted above, have consistently shown histological 
benefit with these agents in a sizable minority of treated patients 
(40-50% with histological response).21,29,30 Similar results have 
been seen with rosiglitazone although subsequent concerns re￾garding adverse effects on lipoprotein profiles which raised safety 
concerns were never resolved.31-33 In a more recent study from of 
45 mg/day pioglitazone for 18 months of placebo controlled ther￾apy followed by 18 months of open label therapy (101 adults of 
approximate age 50 years about 1/2 being diabetic and 3/4 of 
Hispanic descent), consistent results were also seen with resolu￾tion of NASH on follow-up biopsy in 51% of treated patients ver￾sus 19% of placebo treated controls (P<0.001).34
Despite the track record in terms of efficacy with biopsy based 
evaluation,35,36 safety concerns have dampened enthusiasm for 
use of the TZDs in NASH.37 While the purported risk of bladder 
cancer appears to be a spurious legal miscarriage,38 other risks 
appear to be more genuine.39,40 In addition, the effect of in￾creased peripheral fat stores evident as a several kilogram weight 
gain in many treated patients, while avoidable, has also led to de￾creased patient acceptance.41 Moreover, the lack of studies in 
more advanced fibrosis stages of NASH where the risk-benefit 
may be more acceptable significantly limits this group of agents.
The close links between fatty liver (NAFLD), fatty liver with fi￾brosing steatohepatitis (NASH) and diabetes has led to the study 
of other, newer anti-diabetic agents recently reported in random￾ized and controlled trials of NASH. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl pepti￾dase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, is an orally administered insulin sensitiz￾er which did not show benefit in a controlled trial42 while 
liraglutide, a parenterally administered analogue of glucagon-like 
peptid-1 (an incretin) did show histological improvement com￾pared to a placebo treated group after approximately one year of 
therapy in the ‘LEAN’ trial.43 Nine of 23 (39%) treated patients 
versus 2 of 22 (9%) had histological resolution of NASH. Gastro￾intestinal side-effects were common in both groups but more so 
in the treated group. Further study seems warranted with longer 
follow-up and larger study groups.
STATINS
The use of the HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors or statins re￾mains something of an enigma in terms of their effects in fibros￾ing steatohepatitis.44 Based on one very small prospective trial,45
these agents don’t overtly benefit or exacerbate NASH although 
for those with significant vascular risks, the net benefit favors 
their use when indicated for co-existing vascular risks.46,47 In one 
long term cohort study of serial biopsy in NASH patients with 
(n=17) and without (n=51) statin therapy, mean fibrosis scores 
improved in the statin treated group but the percentage of pa￾tients with advanced stage fibrosis was higher in the treated 
group (29% versus 12%) at the end 10-15 years of follow-up.48
As with other agents noted above, the patient’s PNPLA3 geno￾type may significantly influence the effect of these medications.49
Much more work is needed to clarify their role but presently the 
best advice is that their use should be governed by conventional 
risks of vascular disease rather than presence or absence of 
NASH.
