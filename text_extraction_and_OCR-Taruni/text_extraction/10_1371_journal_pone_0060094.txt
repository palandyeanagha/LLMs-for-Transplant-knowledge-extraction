Abstract
CCX282-B, also called vercirnon, is a specific, orally-administered chemokine receptor CCR9 antagonist that regulates
migration and activation of inflammatory cells in the intestine. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of CCX282-B in 436 patients with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
scores were 250–450 and C-reactive protein .7.5 mg/L at study entry. In addition to stable concomitant Crohn’s medication
(85% of subjects), subjects received placebo or CCX282-B (250 mg once daily, 250 mg twice daily, or 500 mg once daily) for
12 weeks. They then received 250 mg CCX282-B twice daily, open-label, through week 16. Subjects who had a clinical
response (a $70 point drop in CDAI) at week 16 were randomly assigned to groups given placebo or CCX282-B (250 mg,
twice daily) for 36 weeks. Primary endpoints were clinical response at Week 8 and sustained clinical response at Week 52.
During the 12-week Induction period, the clinical response was highest in the group given 500 mg CCX282-B once daily.
Response rates at week 8 were 49% in the placebo group, 52% in the group given CCX282-B 250 mg once daily (odds ratio
[OR] = 1.12; p = .667 vs placebo), 48% in the group given CCX282-B 250 mg twice daily (OR = 0.95; p = .833), and 60% in the
group given CCX282-B 500 mg once daily (OR = 1.53; p = .111). At week 12, response rates were 47%, 56% (OR = 1.44;
p = .168), 49% (OR = 1.07; p = .792), and 61% (OR = 1.74; p = .039), respectively. At the end of the Maintenance period (week
52), 47% of subjects on CCX282-B were in remission, compared to 31% on placebo (OR = 2.01; p = .012); 46% showed
sustained clinical responses, compared to 42% on placebo (OR = 1.14; p = .629). CCX282-B was well tolerated. Encouraging
results from this clinical trial led to initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials in Crohn’s disease.

Introduction
Crohn’s disease is characterized by leukocyte infiltration of
segments of the intestine, most commonly in the terminal ileum
and colon, leading to mucosal erosion, ulceration, fistulization,
and stenosis. [1] Chemokine receptors are G-protein coupled cell￾surface proteins that interact with their chemokine ligands, which
are low-molecular weight cytokine-like proteins, forming an
elaborate system that regulates the migration and movement of
inflammatory and immune cells within the body. [2] The C-C
chemokine receptor CCR9 is expressed on a certain subset of
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e60094

circulating lymphocytes and is the principal chemokine receptor
mediating homing to the intestinal mucosa, with enrichment of
CCR9-positive cells in the intestine. [3] CCL25, or thymus￾expressed chemokine (TECK), is the only identified CCR9 ligand
[4], and is highly expressed in the intestine and thymus. CD8-
positive T lymphocytes, plasmablasts, plasma cells, and plasma￾cytoid dendritic cells expressing CCR9 are involved in cellular
interactions contributing to the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease
[5–8].
CCX282-B, also called Traficet-EN, GSK1605786A, or
vercirnon, is a small molecule CCR9 antagonist that inhibits
CCR9- and CCL25-dependent chemotaxis. Preclinical and early
clinical studies suggested that orally-administered CCX282-B
could reduce intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). [9] This clinical trial, termed PROTECT-1 for
Prospective Randomized Oral-Therapy Evaluation in Crohn’s
disease, is the first major study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
a chemokine receptor antagonist in IBD.
Methods
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist
are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and
Protocol S1.
Ethics Statement
All subjects provided written informed consent prior to any
study procedures. The names of ethics committees that reviewed
and approved the clinical trial are provided in the Appendix.
All study procedures were governed by International Confer￾ence on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice standards and the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Study Subjects
Ninety study centers in 17 countries in North America, Europe,
Australia, Brazil, and South Africa enrolled and treated subjects
from March 2006 to May 2009. The clinicaltrials.gov registration
number is NCT00306215 (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT00306215?term = CCX282-B&rank = 2). This clinical trial
was sponsored by ChemoCentryx. Adult subjects with moderate to
severe small bowel and/or colonic Crohn’s disease were enrolled.
The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) [10] at screening was
required to be 250 to 450, with fasting serum C-reactive protein
(CRP) above 7.5 mg/L. Subjects receiving immunosuppressants
or glucocorticoids (up to 20 mg prednisone-equivalent) had to be
on stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, and
concomitant stable use of these drugs during the study was
allowed. Concomitant 5-ASA treatment was also allowed. Anti￾TNF or anti-a4 integrin treatment within 12 weeks prior to
randomization was prohibited, and concomitant use during the
study was not allowed.
Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of CCX282-B in
patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. During the
initial 12-week Induction period, subjects were randomized to
receive placebo or CCX282-B, either 250 mg once daily (q.d.),
250 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), or 500 mg q.d. in a 1.5:1:1:1 ratio.
Randomization was performed centrally using an interactive voice
response system. A blocked randomization schedule was generated
by a biostatistician who was otherwise not involved in the study.
Since efficacy in each CCX282-B group was compared to placebo,
and for sample size efficiency, 1.5 times the number of subjects
were randomized to the placebo group compared to each
CCX282-B group. To conceal the allocation sequence, placebo
and CCX282-B capsules, containing 250 mg CCX282-B, and
bottles were identical in appearance and subjects received one kit
(box) with three bottles of study medication every 4 weeks. The
placebo kits contained three bottles of placebo capsules, the
250 mg q.d. kits contained one bottle of CCX282-B capsules
(bottle 1) and two bottles of placebo (bottles 2 and 3), the 250 mg
b.i.d. kits contained two bottles of CCX282-B capsules (bottles 1
and 3) and one bottle of placebo (bottle 2), and the 500 mg q.d.
kits contained two bottles of CCX282-B capsules (bottles 1 and 2)
and one bottle of placebo (bottle 3). Subjects were asked to take
one capsule from each of the first two bottles every morning and
one capsule from the third bottle every evening, 12 hours after the
morning dose. Study medication was taken with water and could
be taken with or without a meal.
The placebo-controlled portion of the study was double-blind.
Blinding of the study was achieved by the following measures: (1)
Study medication bottle and capsule appearances were identical;
(2) Limited access was provided to the randomization code: Study
site personnel, study subjects, personnel responsible for study
monitoring, and biostatisticians and data managers involved in
data analysis of the study, remained blinded to treatment
assignment for the duration of the study; (3) While laboratory
personnel conducting the pharmacokinetic (PK) assays were not
blinded to treatment assignment, unblinded CCX282 plasma
concentration results were not shared with the study site personnel
or the study staff with direct contact with study sites during the
study; (4) Efficacy data that could potentially be unblinding, such
as serum CRP and CDAI scores, were not made available to study
site personnel, study subjects, personnel responsible for study
monitoring, and biostatisticians and data managers during the
study unless required for safety monitoring.
After trial initiation, the protocol was amended to extend the
study period from 12 weeks to 52 weeks to add a 4-week Active
period and a 36-week Maintenance period. The amendment was
implemented prior to having knowledge of the Induction period
results. Subjects who had completed the Induction period of the
study by the time of implementation of the protocol amendment,
were allowed to enter the 4-week Active treatment period if they
were within 3 months after completing the Induction period. All
consenting subjects who completed 12 weeks in the Induction
period received 250 mg CCX282-B b.i.d. from week 12 to 16 in
an open-label Active period. This Active period was inserted
between the Induction and Maintenance periods to allow all
subjects, including those receiving placebo during the Induction
period, to receive CCX282-B treatment and potentially to be
included in the CDAI $70-point responder population for the
Maintenance period. All consenting subjects who showed a clinical
response at week 16 (CDAI decrease of $70 points compared to
study baseline value), were re-randomized to receive placebo or
CCX282-B 250 mg b.i.d., in a ratio of 1:1.5 in the Maintenance
period, from week 16 to 52. This change in the study allowed for
evaluation of CCX282-B in both induction and maintenance
settings. Corticosteroids, if used at week 16, were to be tapered to
zero over a period not exceeding 6 weeks.
CDAI and CRP (high sensitivity assay with 3 mg/L as upper
limit of normal) were recorded at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16,
20, 28, 36, 44, and 52. Consenting subjects, at study sites that
agreed to participate, underwent colonoscopy at baseline and week
12. The Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS)
was calculated using a modification of the method described by
Mary and Modigliani. [11] The length of disease involvement and
ulceration was recorded as actual lengths, in cm, rather than

Figure 1. Subject Disposition. A total of 945 subjects were screened of whom 436 were randomized. Screen failure occurred most commonly for
low CRP (57%) and low CDAI (24%). In the Induction period, 144 subjects were randomized to placebo, and 98, 97, and 97 to CCX282-B 250 mg q.d.,
250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg q.d., respectively. One subject, in the 250 mg b.i.d. group was excluded from the ITT population in the Induction period
because the subject did not take any study medication. In the four groups, 83%, 87%, 86%, and 81% completed the Induction period. Most common
primary reasons for withdrawal were adverse events and lack of efficacy with similar distributions across treatment groups. A total of 321 subjects
started the 4-week open-label Active period, receiving CCX282-B 250 mg b.i.d.; 298 subjects completed this period, and of these, 241 clinical
responders were enrolled in the Maintenance period. These subjects were re-randomized to placebo (95 subjects) or 250 mg b.i.d. CCX282-B (146
subjects). One subject, in the 250 mg b.i.d. group was excluded from the ITT population in the Maintenance period because the subject did not take
any study medication. Of the two groups, 79% and 78%, respectively, completed the Maintenance period. The most common primary reason for
withdrawal in the placebo group was lack of efficacy, 13% (12 of 95 subjects), compared to 8% (12 of 145 subjects) in the CCX282-B group, whereas
the most common primary reason for withdrawal from the CCX282-B group was adverse events, 7% (10 of 145 subjects), compared to 1% (1 of 95

normalized on a 10-cm scale. CCX282 plasma concentrations
were measured in samples taken at single random time points from
all subjects at each study visit using high performance liquid
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (lower
limit of detection 2 ng/mL).
Definition of Endpoints and Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Induction period was
attainment of a clinical response, defined as a decrease in CDAI of
at least 70 points from baseline, at week 8. Safety endpoints
included the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events,
and withdrawals due to adverse events. Pre-defined secondary
subjects) in the placebo group. Most of the adverse events leading to withdrawal in the CCX282-B group (9 of 10 cases) were related to Crohn’s
disease. Arguably, withdrawal for lack of efficacy is similar to withdrawals because of Crohn’s disease-related adverse events. In both instances, the
Crohn’s worsen or fail to improve. Therefore, when the number of withdrawals due to Crohn’s disease-related adverse events and lack of efficacy are
added, the incidence is similar for the placebo and CCX282-B groups, i.e., 13/95 (14%) for placebo and 21/145 (14%) for CCX282-B.

efficacy endpoints included clinical response at week 12, as well as
clinical remission (CDAI #150) [12] and $100-point decrease in
CDAI from baseline at weeks 8 and 12. The primary endpoint for
the Maintenance period was maintenance of response from week
16 to week 52. Loss of response was defined as an increase in
CDAI of more than 70 points and an increase to above 250, or a
missing CDAI measurement. The main secondary endpoint was
maintenance of remission through week 52. Loss of remission was
defined as a CDAI above 150.
The primary analysis was in the intention-to-treat population
for both Induction and Maintenance periods, including all
randomized subjects who received study medication. Subjects
who discontinued treatment, who had missing CDAI scores, or
who received rescue treatment or surgery, were considered
treatment failures from that point forward. For the primary and
main pre-specified secondary endpoints, the statistical analysis was
based on Mantel-Haenszel tests, stratified according to geographic
region, comparing each CCX282-B group with the placebo group.
Repeated measures mixed effect ANOVA models, including terms
for treatment, time point, treatment by time point interaction, and
geographic region were employed for continuous variables. All
interactions were tested at an alpha level of 0.1 and statistical
testing was two-sided.
Power calculations were based on a 25% placebo clinical
response and a 50% clinical response in at least one CCX282-B
group at week 8. A target number of 423 subjects would achieve
90% power at an overall alpha level of 0.05, 0.017 for each
CCX282-B group compared to placebo, based on Bonferroni￾adjusted Mantel-Haenszel testing. The protocol made allowance
for an optional interim analysis when all subjects participating in
the Maintenance period of the study had completed the Week 28
visit. A decision was made by the sponsor, upon review of the

to allow the study to run uninterrupted to completion. This
decision was made to preserve the integrity of the Maintenance
period of the trial. Therefore, the alpha level for the final analysis
was 0.05.
Results
Study Subjects
Subject disposition is shown in Figure 1. Demographics and
baseline characteristics of the study population were similar across
treatment groups for the Induction period and the Maintenance
period (Table 1). Of 945 subjects screened, 436 were randomized.
Low CDAI and CRP were the main reasons for exclusion. Over
80% of subjects completed the Induction period, and nearly 80%
the Maintenance period.
Efficacy
Subjects underwent an aggregate treatment regimen of 52
weeks: a 12-week Induction period followed by a 4-week open￾label Active period and a 36-week Maintenance period. Table 2
shows the CDAI response and remission results from the 12-week
Induction period. The CCX282-B 500 mg q.d. group showed the
highest CDAI response rates ($70 point decrease in CDAI): 56%,
60%, and 61% at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively (Table 2 and
Figure 2a). The placebo group response rates were 49%, 49%, and
47%, respectively, at these time points. The odds ratio (OR)
between 500 mg q.d. CCX282-B and placebo was 1.53; 98.3%
Confidence Interval [CI] 0.81, 2.89; p = 0.111 at Week 8, the
predefined primary time point, and the OR was 1.74; 98.3% CI
0.92, 3.29; p = 0.039 at week 12, the predefined secondary time
point. The 250 mg CCX282-B groups showed no significant
differences in CDAI response compared to placebo at any time
point. The 500 mg q.d. group showed higher clinical response
rates compared with placebo and the 250 mg groups across all
gender, Crohn’s disease anatomic location strata, including
colonic Crohn’s disease, as well as other concomitant Crohn’s
medication use strata (Table 3). Age, race, gender, disease
location, and Crohn’s medication did not show significant
interaction (at p,0.1) with CDAI response. During the Induction
period, the CDAI remission (#150) rate was not significantly
different across treatment groups (Table 2). The proportion of
subjects with $100 point decrease in CDAI was 41%, 49%, and
55%, at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively, in the 500 mg q.d. group
compared to 40%, 42%, and 40%, respectively, for the placebo
group (Table 2); the OR between 500 mg CCX282-B q.d. and
placebo at Week 12 was 1.79; 98.3% CI 0.95, 3.37; p = 0.029. The
250 mg groups did not show significant differences compared to
placebo.
Approximately 26% of subjects (112 of 435) had previously
received anti-TNF therapies, and 53 of these were non-responsive
to one or more of these anti-TNF therapies based on data collected
during screening. CDAI results from an exploratory analysis in the
anti-TNF-experienced subjects are shown in Table S1. In the
subset of subjects who were non-responsive to one or more anti￾TNF drugs, CDAI $70 and $100 point responses at week 12
occurred in 8 of 14 (57%) subjects on CCX282-B 500 mg q.d.,
compared to 5 of 18 (28%) on placebo. Remission was observed in
3 of 14 (21%) on CCX282-B 500 mg q.d. and 1 of 18 (6%) on
placebo.
The 321 subjects who entered the Active period, during which
all subjects received CCX282-B 250 mg b.i.d., had a median
CDAI of 184. At the end of the 4-week Active period, the median
CDAI was 160. Of subjects completing the Active period, 241
(75.1%) showed a clinical response with a drop in CDAI of $70
(relative to their baseline value), and were re-randomized in a 1:1.5
ratio to receive placebo or CCX282-B 250 mg b.i.d. in the 36-
week Maintenance period.
CDAI response and remission results for the Maintenance
period are shown in Figure 2 and elaborated in Table 4. At week
52, 47% of subjects on CCX282-B were in remission compared
with 31% on placebo (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.16, 3.49; p = 0.012;
Figure 2c). In a pre-specified last-observation-carried-forward
sensitivity analysis, remission was achieved in 74 of 145 subjects
(51%) in the CCX282-B group and 32 of 95 subjects (34%) in the
placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.20, 3.51; p = 0.009).

Furthermore, at week 52, 41% (60 of 145 subjects) on CCX282-B
were in corticosteroid-free remission compared to 28% (27 of 95
subjects) on placebo (p = 0.041; see Figure 2d). A sustained
response at every visit during the Maintenance period was seen in
46% of subjects in the CCX282-B 250 mg b.i.d. group compared
to 42% in the placebo group (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.67, 1.92;
p = 0.629), and sustained remission (CDAI #150) was observed in
41% in the CCX282-B group and 30% in the placebo group (OR
1.60, 95% CI 0.77, 3.30; p = 0.205). In a pre-specified last￾observation-carried-forward sensitivity analysis, sustained remis￾sion was achieved in 42 of 87 subjects (48%) in the CCX282-B
group and 17 of 53 subjects (32%) in the placebo group (OR 1.94,
95% CI 0.95, 3.95; p = 0.066).
The changes from baseline to week 12 in CDAI, CRP, and
CDEIS are shown in Table 5. The CCX282-B 500 mg q.d. group
showed the largest mean decreases from baseline to week 12 in
CDAI, CRP, and CDEIS. Mean change from baseline to week 12
in CDEIS was 23.0 in placebo, compared with 28.7, 2.0, and
210.8 (p = 0.049 vs. placebo; Figure 2b) in the CCX282-B groups,
respectively. Mean change from baseline to week 12 in CDEIS,
calculated using normalized lengths of Crohn’s involvement [11],
was 21.1 in placebo, compared with 23.1, 0.9, and 24.4
(p = 0.049 vs. placebo) in the CCX282-B groups, respectively.
During the 36-week Maintenance period, median CDAI
decreased from 128 to 95 in the CCX282-B group and increased
from 136 to 146 in the placebo group. Median CRP levels
decreased from 12.6 mg/L to 8.7 mg/L in the CCX282-B group,
and from 14.1 mg/L to 12.3 mg/L in the placebo group from
week 16 to 52. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was initiated or
intensified in 21% (20/95 subjects) of the placebo group and 11%
(16/145 subjects) of the CCX282-B group (p = 0.036; see
Figure 2e). Conversely, corticosteroid therapy in CCX282-B
subjects was stopped in 57% (32/56 subjects on corticosteroids at
the start of the Maintenance period) compared to 43% (13/30
subjects) in the placebo group. Anti-TNF rescue treatment was
given to 4% (4 of 95 subjects) in the placebo group and 1% (1 of
145 subjects) in the CCX282-B group. One subject, withdrawn
from CCX282-B treatment, received natalizumab during the
Maintenance period.

CCR9 Blocker CCX282-B in Crohn’s Disease
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e60094

Population pharmacokinetic data from the Induction period
indicated that the highest maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
occurred with 500 mg q.d. CCX282-B. The modeled estimated
mean (6SD) Cmax was 736 (6141), 812 (6147), and 1032 (6163)
ng/mL in the CCX282-B 250 mg q.d., 250 mg b.i.d., and 500 mg
q.d. groups, respectively.
Safety
Safety results are summarized in Table 6. In the Induction
period, 63% (90 subjects) on placebo reported at least one adverse
event compared to 60% (174 subjects) on CCX282-B. The
incidence of the most common adverse events was similar across
treatment groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 10% placebo
versus 9% in the CCX282-B group (15/144 subjects compared to
25/291, respectively). Study drug withdrawals due to adverse
events in the CCX282-B group occurred in 7% (20 subjects)
compared to 13% (19 subjects) in the placebo group. A lower
incidence of withdrawals attributed to gastrointestinal adverse
events and exacerbation of Crohn’s disease was also observed in
the CCX282-B group overall compared to placebo. One subject,
in the placebo group, died during the study from septic
complications following intestinal perforation. Another subject,
in the 250 mg b.i.d. group, who had lack of response after the
week 16 visit, died 39 days later due to complications of Crohn’s
disease that were deemed unrelated to study medication.
Infections occurred in 16% of both placebo and CCX282-B
groups during the Induction period (23/144 on placebo and 47/
291 on CCX282-B). No opportunistic infections were reported.
No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters
occurred in any of the treatment groups.
The incidence of the most common adverse events during the
Maintenance period was similar across treatment groups, and 58
of 95 subjects (61%) in the placebo group reported at least one
adverse event compared to 98 of 145 subjects (68%) in the
CCX282-B 250 mg b.i.d. group. Serious adverse events occurred
in 10% of placebo group versus 9% in the CCX282-B group (9/95
subjects versus 13/145, respectively). No serious infections or
opportunistic infections were observed during the Maintenance
period and no deaths occurred.
Discussion
CCX282-B, an orally-administered CCR9 antagonist, is the
first chemokine receptor antagonist to be tested in IBD. In this
clinical trial, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CCX282-B
were evaluated in a 12-week Induction period, followed by a 4-
week Active period, and then a 36-week Maintenance period.
Blocking CCR9 is a new approach to Crohn’s disease therapy and
a test of this mechanism has not been attempted previously in
clinical trials. Accordingly, the trial design largely reflected that of
other agents, predominantly the anti-TNF modalities. While
primary endpoints of this trial were not achieved, pre-specified
secondary endpoints were met.
Patients with both small and large bowel disease were eligible
for the trial. The decision to include patients with large bowel
disease was based on experimental evidence that CCR9 and
TECK are expressed in both small and large bowel[13–15], and
emerging experimental evidence that CCR9 inhibition is effective
in the MDR1a2/2 mouse model of colitis [15].
In the Induction period of the study, the CCX282-B 500 mg
q.d. group showed the highest CDAI response. The difference in
clinical response rate (drop in CDAI $70 points) between 500 mg
q.d. CCX282-B and placebo (DCDAI) was 7%, 11%, and 14% at
weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively. This increasing DCDAI was also
observed for CDAI $100-point response (1%, 6%, and 14%,
respectively). This suggests that the full effect of CCX282-B may
take longer than 8 weeks to manifest clinically, and week 12 might
have been a more appropriate primary time point for the
Induction period.
The DCDAI of 14% at week 12 for CDAI $70-point response
between 500 mg q.d. CCX282-B and placebo is generally
comparable to results from clinical trials of other therapies that
have found a place in clinical practice. For example, at 12 weeks,
the DCDAI was 10 to 16% with natalizumab [16,17] and 9% with
certolizumab. [18] There are no 12-week time point data available
for adalimumab [19].
CDAI clinical response differences between 500 mg q.d.
CCX282-B and placebo were seen across all GI location strata
(Table 3); the treatment difference was most pronounced in
patients with rectal and perianal disease (DCDAI 29%). There are
insufficient patient numbers in each GI location stratum to be

Sustained response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score from baseline (last non missing value before the first dose in the Induction period) $70 at Week 16 and no
loss of the response during the 36-week Maintenance period. Loss of clinical response was defined as a CDAI score increase at any visit after the Week 16 visit of $70
from the Week 16 value and an absolute CDAI value of .250, or the need for intervention after Week 16. Missing values were also imputed as loss of response. b
Sustained remission was defined as a CDAI score #150 at Week 16 and Week 52 and all visits in between. If data from any time point between Week 16 and 62 were
missing for a subject, sustained remission was not achieved.

definitive, but this finding, if confirmed, would support a role for
CCX282-B in treatment of patients with both small and large
bowel disease.
Differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles between the 500 mg
and 250 mg dosage regimens might explain the apparent
differences in efficacy results. Chemotaxis studies of human
lymphocytes in 100% human serum indicate that 800 ng/mL
CCX282 is required to block 90% of CCR9 receptors (serum
IC90). Furthermore, full efficacy in pre-clinical studies required
CCX282 plasma concentrations above the serum IC90. [9] Based
on modeled population pharmacokinetic profiles, plasma concen￾trations with 500 mg q.d. CCX282-B exceeded the serum IC90 for
at least 8 hours following dosing. However, the mean maximum
CCX282 plasma concentrations at the 250 mg b.i.d dose were
probably sub-therapeutic in the Induction setting. This difference
in CCX282 plasma exposure between the 500 mg q.d. and
250 mg b.i.d. dosing regimens may explain the different clinical
efficacy profiles in the Induction period. Since plasma samples
were taken only at single time points at study visits, sparse data
were available for each subject, and full pharmacokinetic profiles
are not available for individual subjects. Therefore, correlations of
individual pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax or AUC with
CDAI response could not be made reliably. CCX282-B 250 mg
b.i.d. was selected as the dose for the Active and Maintenance
periods before data from the Induction period, showing that
500 mg q.d. might be more effective, were available. Although the

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e60094

250 mg b.i.d. dose was apparently ineffective in the Induction
period, this dose provided some evidence of efficacy in the
Maintenance period. One potential explanation for these obser￾vations is that higher CCX282 plasma concentrations may be
required to induce a clinical response in active disease, while lower
plasma concentrations may effectively sustain remission subse￾quently when disease activity is lower. Such findings are not
uncommon for maintenance dosing during remission with a
variety of therapeutic modalities in chronic disease.
Changes in CRP and CDEIS support the efficacy of 500 mg
q.d. CCX282-B in the Induction period. Of all four groups,
500 mg q.d. CCX282-B showed the largest decrease in serum
CRP, of approximately 30%, at 12 weeks. The higher CRP level
entry criterion of .7.5 mg/L in PROTECT-1 compared to other
clinical trials, which resulted in a higher mean baseline CRP
compared to these trials, [16,18,19] limits comparison across
studies. Nonetheless, the absolute decrease in CRP with 500 mg
CCX282-B is generally comparable to the changes observed with
anti-TNF agents [18,19] and with natalizumab. [17] Subjects
receiving 500 mg q.d. CCX282-B also showed a greater decrease
in CDEIS compared to placebo, suggesting that CCX282-B
treatment may improve intestinal mucosal lesions.
The percentage of subjects reaching clinical remission (CDAI of
#150), was significantly higher in the CCX282-B group compared
to placebo at the end of the Maintenance period, even though
remission rates were not significantly different among groups in
the Induction period. The baseline CDAI of the study population
in PROTECT-1 was 333 (653), or approximately 30 points
higher than in other recent studies, [16,18,19] so that a larger
absolute drop in CDAI was required to reach the CDAI score of
150, which was used to define remission. This high baseline CDAI
could therefore have reduced the chance of achieving remission in
a 12-week Induction trial, and of demonstrating a difference
between CCX282-B and placebo groups. Some support for this
contention was provided by an exploratory analysis indicating that
with CDAI ‘‘near-remission’’ 5-point incremental thresholds of
155 up to 170, the near-remission rate in the CCX282-B 500 mg
q.d. group was up to 10% higher than the placebo group (38.1%
compared to 28.5% with 170 as threshold; Table S2).
In the Maintenance period, the incidence of relapse in the
placebo group was 58% over 36 weeks, which was lower than
anticipated. In a comparable natalizumab clinical trial, the
incidence of relapse was 72% at the 36-week time point in the
placebo group. [16] Therefore, the placebo response rate in our
study was higher than expected. A possible reason is that the
majority of subjects in this study (85%), including the subjects
receiving placebo, were receiving background medications for
Crohn’s disease including corticosteroids. This difference may also
reflect variations in clinical trial design. For example, in
PROTECT-1, all subjects received 4 weeks of CCX282-B
treatment at the end of the Induction period and before entering
the Maintenance period. In the natalizumab clinical trial, [16]
there was no active treatment period between the Induction period
and the Maintenance period.
Although subjects who have previously received anti-TNF
agents often have lower response rates to other treatments, in this
study, exploratory analyses showed that CCX282-B might have
utility in these subjects. This finding is a topic of further study in
ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.
The apparent safety and tolerability of CCX282-B observed in
this study are encouraging as most other medications for Crohn’s
disease have limitations such as increased risk of infection.
Thiopurines, widely used to maintain remission, are also
associated with an increased risk of neoplasia, particularly of the
lymphohemopoietic system. [20] Preclinical and early phase
CCX282-B clinical studies have supported the favorable safety
and tolerability profile, [9] and if confirmed in larger studies,
would be beneficial.
Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size,
the strict inclusion criteria, defining patients with moderately to
severely active Crohn’s disease, so that results cannot yet be
generalized to less or more severely affected patients. Furthermore,
as this is the first major trial of a CCR9 antagonist, the design of
the trial and selection of time points relied on evidence from
mechanistically unrelated medical treatments. Lastly, the placebo
response rates observed during both the Induction and Mainte￾nance periods of this trial were relatively high.
In conclusion, this study suggests that CCX282-B, an orally￾administered and specific CCR9 antagonist, provides a novel
approach to modulating intestine-specific inflammatory responses,
and if results are confirmed might be an effective therapy for IBD.
Targeting the chemokine system offers the prospect of organ
specific immunotherapy for a wide variety of immunologically￾activated diseases. Phase 3 clinical trials are now being conducted
to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CCX282-B (also
called GSK1605786A or vercirnon) in groups of patients with
broader inclusion criteria.
