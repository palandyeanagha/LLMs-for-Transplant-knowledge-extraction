Abstract
Background: Platelet activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease (SCD) suggesting
antiplatelet agents may be therapeutic. To evaluate the safety of prasugrel, a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent, in
adult patients with SCD, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
Methods: The primary endpoint, safety, was measured by hemorrhagic events requiring medical intervention.
Patients were randomized to prasugrel 5 mg daily (n = 41) or placebo (n = 21) for 30 days. Platelet function by
VerifyNowW P2Y12 and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assays at days 10 and 30 were significantly inhibited
in prasugrel- compared with placebo-treated SCD patients.
Results: There were no hemorrhagic events requiring medical intervention in either study arm. Mean pain rate
(percentage of days with pain) and intensity in the prasugrel arm were decreased compared with placebo.
However, these decreases did not reach statistical significance. Platelet surface P-selectin and plasma soluble
P-selectin, biomarkers of in vivo platelet activation, were significantly reduced in SCD patients receiving prasugrel
compared with placebo. In sum, prasugrel was well tolerated and not associated with serious hemorrhagic events.
Conclusions: Despite the small size and short duration of this study, there was a decrease in platelet activation
biomarkers and a trend toward decreased pain.

Background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) (the common term used for the
clinical syndrome that results from homozygous hemoglobin
S; compound heterozygous Hb S/C; and compound hetero￾zygous Hb S/β0/+-thalassemia) results from a mutation in the
β-globin gene. The clinical manifestations of disease are due
to hemolysis, and intermittent microvascular occlusion
marked by painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and eventual
end-organ damage from repeated bouts of ischemia￾reperfusion injury resulting in significant disabilities and early
mortality. SCD pathophysiology is multi-factorial. The
reduced intracellular solubility of HbS leads to intra￾erythrocytic hemoglobin polymerization and loss of red cell
deformability under conditions of hypoxia and acidosis [1].
The sickle red blood cell is also abnormally adhesive to
activated endothelial cells even in the absence of sickling [2].
Neutrophils and monocytes are activated and contribute to
vascular occlusion [3-6]. Numerous studies have also shown
activation of the hemostatic system, including the coagulation
cascade and platelets [7-9]. Activation of all these cells and
the coagulation system likely contributes to a prothrombotic
state producing the acute and chronic disease manifestations.
Previous work, using various soluble and immunological
biomarkers, has shown that platelets are activated in
patients with SCD [10-12]. Some data have suggested
increased platelet activation during VOC [12-14]. Possible
mechanisms whereby activated platelets contribute to the
pathogenesis of VOC include release of thrombospondin 1

during platelet activation that supports aberrant red blood
cell (RBC) adhesion to endothelium and matrix proteins,
and platelets directly mediating RBC adherence to en￾dothelial cells and capture onto neutrophils and monocytes
(heterotypic cell-cell adherence; and activation of neutrophils
and monocytes via formation of platelet-monocyte and
platelet-neutrophil aggregates). The activated leukocytes
augment the overall inflammatory state and promote further
vascular and tissue damage.
There have been studies of antiplatelet agents for SCD
patients including use of aspirin [15] and the first gener￾ation thienopyridine adenosine diphosphate (ADP) re￾ceptor inhibitor, ticlopidine [16,17]. In general, these
studies have been relatively small, underpowered, and
without control groups. Prasugrel, a third-generation
platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist, is FDA￾approved in combination with aspirin for treatment of
patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing per￾cutaneous coronary intervention. We performed a phase
2, double-blind, randomized trial of prasugrel compared
with placebo in patients with SCD. The primary safety
outcome was treatment-emergent hemorrhagic events re￾quiring medical intervention. Secondary safety outcomes
included all adverse events (AEs) including those that
required study drug discontinuation. The efficacy outcome
measures were frequency and intensity of pain ascertained
by self-administered pain diary; frequency of pain requir￾ing medical attention; pharmacodynamic effects on
platelets measured by VerifyNowW P2Y12 reaction units
(PRU) and vasodilator-associated stimulated phosphopro￾tein (VASP) platelet reactivity index (PRI); and biomarkers
of platelet activation. We hypothesized that prasugrel
would: 1) be well tolerated, 2) inhibit platelet activation,
and 3) decrease pain.
Methods
This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial
to assess the safety of prasugrel 5 mg PO (by mouth)
daily compared with placebo in adult patients with SCD
(clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01167023). The study was
conducted at 18 sites in the United States and Canada
from 26 August 2010 to 13 June 2011. The study was
approved by the local institutional review boards and
was performed in compliance with principles of good
clinical practice (GCP) and in accordance with the
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each patient
voluntarily signed an informed consent document before
entering the study.
Eligibility
To be included in the study, patients had to be adults 18
to 55 years of age with SCD (genotypes HbSS, HbSC,
HbS-β0
-thalassemia and HbS-β+
-thalassemia), who did
not have a diagnosis of acute VOC within 30 days of the
study screening visit. Patients with severe hepatic or
renal dysfunction, hematocrit <18%, and those at risk of
excessive bleeding complications including platelet
count <100,000 per cubic millimeter, prior history of
bleeding disorders, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, ret￾inal hemorrhage, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or
intracranial hemorrhage were excluded from the study.
We felt these conservative exclusion criteria were
warranted given this new patient population. Use of as￾pirin or other antithrombotics was not allowed within
10 days of entry or during the study. Non-steroidal anti￾inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treatment of pain
were not permitted in the 5 days prior to randomization
or for ≥5 consecutive days during the study period. Use
of hydroxyurea was permitted in patients already on a
stable dose 30 days prior to randomization.
Study design
The study consisted of 2 phases (Phase A and Phase B)
(Figure 1) and employed an adaptive design with decisions
about dose allocations made as the trial progressed. Dur￾ing each phase, patients were randomized to prasugrel or
placebo in a 2:1 manner and stratified by sickle-cell geno￾type (HbSS, HbS-β+
-thalassemia and HbS-β0
-thalassemia
genotype patients in one stratum, and HbSC genotype
patients in another stratum). We stratified in this way be￾cause some data [18,19], though not all [10,14], suggest
more pronounced platelet activation in patients with
HbSS than HbSC. In addition, our limited studies showed
no difference in platelet activation between Hb S-β+
-thal￾assemia and HbSS patients [10]. Patients underwent
screening (Visit 0) and returned to the site for Visit 1 (0 to
10 days after screening), Visit 2 (10 ± 2 days after Visit 1),
and Visit 3 (30 ± 3 days after Visit 1). Patients were
contacted by phone for Visit 4 (30 days after last dose of
study drug) to collect information on adverse events (AEs)
and serious adverse events (SAEs).
All patients randomized to prasugrel during Phase A
received a 5-mg/day dose. When pharmacodynamic
(PD) data from Visit 2 were available for ≥16 patients
treated with prasugrel, a Data Monitoring Committee
(DMC) assessed the results and reviewed initial safety
data prior to making a determination regarding the
Phase B prasugrel dose. If at Visit 2, ≥ 60% of ≥ 16
patients treated with prasugrel in Phase A had the
equivalent of < 25% inhibition of platelet aggregation
(IPA) as measured by light transmission aggregometry
(LTA), then a 7.5-mg/day prasugrel dose was to be used
in Phase B for patients who weighed ≥ 60 kg, and a
5-mg/day prasugrel dose would be used in patients who
weighed < 60 kg. Otherwise, Phase B was to use a
5-mg/day prasugrel dose for all patients, regardless of
weight. After the DMC determined the Phase B dose, fu￾ture patients were randomized into Phase B, while all

patients randomized in Phase A completed their sche￾duled follow-up. Based on the accumulated data, as
reviewed by the DMC, a 5-mg daily dose was used for
the remainder of the study. The duration of active treat￾ment and pain assessment was 30 days and the total
duration with follow-up was 60 days.
Endpoint assessment
The primary endpoint was the incidence of hemorrhagic
events requiring medical attention: an unscheduled visit
or call to a medical provider due to a complaint of
bleeding while on study drug. Bleeding events that did
not require medical attention were captured, in retro￾spect, as adverse events at routine assessments. This
endpoint was chosen because sickle cell patients
represented a new population for this drug and it was
felt necessary to have robust safety data in adults prior
to proceeding with a planned study in pediatric patients.
Endpoint ascertainment was achieved by interviewing
patients at each visit. Additional safety evaluations
included the assessment of clinical laboratory test
results, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardio￾gram results, fundoscopies, and AEs. Information on
SAEs was collected at occurrence as well as by telephone
interview 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Disease￾related treatment emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) includ￾ing VOC, acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, and
stroke were reported as AEs or SAEs as appropriate.
Efficacy was a secondary endpoint as assessed by inci￾dence of any pain events requiring medical attention in
the study. In addition, the efficacy of prasugrel (5 mg)
compared with placebo was measured by monitoring the
frequency and intensity of pain related to SCD as
recorded in patient pain diaries each day for 30 days. A
scale of 0 to 9 was used to evaluate pain intensity, with 0
indicating no pain, and 9 indicating unbearable pain.
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker evaluations
Platelet inhibition was assessed by the Accumetrics
VerifyNowW P2Y12 assay and the VASP phosphorylation
assay as previously described [20,21]. Assay data was
reported as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) and percent in￾hibition (device reported) for the VerifyNowW P2Y12
assay and platelet reactivity index (PRI) for VASP.
Platelet activation was assessed by immunoassay deter￾mination of plasma, serum, and cellular biomarkers of
platelet activation. Multi-color fluorescent activated cell
sorting (FACS) and monoclonal antibodies were used to
determine platelet P-selectin expression using previously
published protocols [22,23]. Soluble P-selectin (sP￾selectin), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), thromboxane
B2 (serum TXB2), and prothrombin fragment F1.2
(F1.2) were determined using standard enzyme-linked
immunoassays according to manufacturer’s directions.
Pharmacodynamic parameters and biomarkers were
assessed at Visits 1, 2, and 3. VerifyNowW P2Y12 was
performed locally; platelet surface P-selectin was
determined at the Center for Platelet Research Studies;
and all other evaluations were performed at a central la￾boratory. Approximately 30–50 mL of venous blood was
collected by venipuncture at each visit for use in PD and
biomarker testing.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized by treatment
group with values presented as mean ± standard devi￾ation (SD) for continuous variables, and counts
(percentages) for categorical variables. An analysis of
variance (ANOVA) model for continuous variables and a
Fisher’s exact test for the categorical variables were used
for comparisons between treatment groups. The number
and percentage of patients experiencing safety endpoints
including the frequency of hemorrhagic events requiring
Figure 1 Adaptive study design Phase A and Phase B. Decisions about dose allocations were made as the trial progressed. If interim analysis
of pharmacodynamic data revealed insufficient platelet inhibition in the first 16 patients randomized to 5-mg daily prasugrel, the dose was to be
escalated to 7.5 mg. Dotted line denotes dose escalation plan per protocol; no dose escalation occurred occur during the study.

medical intervention were summarized by treatment
group.
Pain rate and pain intensity were summarized by treat￾ment group using descriptive statistics. Pain rate was
defined as the number of days reported with any pain
related to SCD divided by the number of daily pain diar￾ies completed. Pain intensity was the sum of a patient’s
pain scores on a scale of 0 to 9 divided by the number of
daily pain diaries completed. An analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) model with baseline pain intensity, treat￾ment group, and sickle-cell genotype (HbSS, HbS-β0
-
thalassemia and HbS-β+
-thalassemia in one stratum and
HbSC in another stratum) in the model was used for
treatment group comparison. A sensitivity analysis using
only data from patients who completed 20 or more daily
pain diaries was performed to verify that missing data
did not introduce bias. The number of patients experien￾cing a pain event that required medical attention was
compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact
test.
Pharmacodynamic and biomarker results were sum￾marized by treatment group and visit. The post-baseline
results for each PD and biomarker parameter were
analyzed using a mixed-effects model repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis with the fixed effects of treatment,
baseline parameter result, sickle-cell genotype, visit, and
visit-by-treatment interaction, as well as a patient ran￾dom effect included in the model. A compound
symmetry variance-covariance structure was used to es￾timate within-patient errors.
Because a more conventional way to stratify analysis
for sickle cell genotypes is to compare HbSS and HbS￾β0
-thalassemia with HbSC and HbS-β+
-thalassemia (based
on disease severity), the ANCOVA analysis for pain rate
and pain intensity and the MMRM analysis for PD and
biomarker parameters were repeated with adjustment of
genotype based on the conventional stratification. This
sensitivity analysis did not change any of the results for
statistical significance on the treatment comparison.
The sample size calculation for this study is limited due
to the rarity of the primary endpoint of hemorrhagic events
requiring medical intervention, and so is supported by a
power calculation for the efficacy endpoints. A sample size
of 60 patients with the ratio of prasugrel to placebo as 2:1
provides 80% power to detect approximately 60% reduction
in the mean pain rate at the 2-sided 0.05 level. This results
in the ability to detect an effect size of 0.78.
Results
A total of 62 patients were randomly assigned to treat￾ment (prasugrel [n = 41], placebo [n = 21]) and were
included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set
(Figure 2). A total of 57 patients completed the study
(39 [95.1%] prasugrel; 18 [85.7%] placebo). No patients
received aspirin, nor NSAIDs, during the study. One pa￾tient was found not to have SCD (β-thalassemia trait
only) and another patient was enrolled and randomized
as the study ended and it was decided not to proceed
with treatment of that patient.
The baseline characteristics of the treatment groups
were well balanced (Table 1). The mean pain intensity
for all patients was low, likely reflecting that these
patients were clinically stable without recent painful
episodes. A greater proportion of patients randomized to
prasugrel had a history of acute chest syndrome and sys￾temic and pulmonary hypertension.
No patient experienced hemorrhagic adverse events
that required acute medical intervention (Table 2), the
primary endpoint of the study. Eight patients in the
prasugrel arm experienced 9 hemorrhagic AEs, the ma￾jority of which were mild and possibly related to the
study drug (Table 3) but did not result in study drug

the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set.

discontinuation. The proportion of SAEs and all TEAEs
was similar between the groups. Most SAEs were pain
events requiring medical intervention. The rate of study
drug discontinuation was similar between treatment
groups. No patients discontinued the study due to an
AE. There were 2 AEs that led to study drug discontinu￾ation in the prasugrel arm, but neither of these events
was hemorrhagic or deemed by the investigator to be
related to the study drug. The events were pain not
otherwise specified and bronchitis. There were no clinic￾ally significant differences in the routine laboratory
values (complete blood count, chemistry panels, and
liver function tests) with serial follow-up (data not
shown).
The efficacy endpoints in this study were the rate and
intensity of pain as recorded by daily self-administered
pain diaries. The mean completion percentage for diaries
(number of entries/total possible days) was 95.7% for the
prasugrel arm and 92.6% for the placebo arm. There
were numerical decreases in proportion of days with
pain and pain intensity in the prasugrel treated patients:
a 21% relative reduction (least-squares [LS] mean: 42.2%
vs. 53.5%) in pain rate and a relative 25% reduction (LS
mean: 1.8 vs. 2.4) in pain intensity. However, these
differences did not reach statistical significance. An al￾ternative analysis showed that a greater proportion of
patients in the prasugrel arm (50%) reported no pain
throughout the study (27.5% of patients with a
percentage of days with pain = 0) or infrequent pain
(22.5% of patients with ≤ 25% of days with pain) versus
22.3% of placebo-treated patients having either no
pain (5.6% of patients with a percentage of days with

pain = 0) or infrequent pain (16.7% of patients with ≤
25% of days with pain) (Figure 3A). Nine of 40 (22.5%)
of prasugrel patients had painful episodes during the
study period versus 7/19 (36.8%) in the placebo group.
Again, this was not statistically different.
The point-of-care VerifyNowW P2Y12 device and VASP
PRI were used to assess prasugrel’s pharmacodynamic ef￾fect on platelets. Figure 4 shows that by both measures,
5 mg prasugrel resulted in statistically significant greater
platelet inhibition compared to placebo (P < .001) at both
day 10 and day 30. About 20% of patients had <20% inhib￾ition, which is consistent with the rate seen with the 5-mg
maintenance dose in previous studies [24-26]. Because the
proportion of patients did not fulfill the pre-specified cri￾terion for escalation, the dose remained at 5 mg for the
duration of the study.
Numerous studies have shown that platelets are
activated in SCD patients [10,12] and that markers of
platelet activation are associated with complications
[13,14]. The effects of prasugrel on platelet activation
were measured with both cellular (platelet P-selectin)
and soluble biomarkers (TXB2, soluble CD40L, and sol￾uble P-selectin). There were statistically significant
decreases in platelet P-selectin and soluble P-selectin at
both days 10 and 30 in the prasugrel arm compared to
placebo. The decreases also reached statistical signifi￾cance for TXB2 at day 10 and for soluble CD40L at day
30 in the prasugrel arm compared to placebo (Figure 5).
Therefore, prasugrel was shown not only to inhibit
platelet function, but also to decrease platelet activation
in patients with SCD.
Discussion
In this randomized Phase 2 study of prasugrel in adult
patients with various genotypes of SCD in steady
state, 30 days of treatment was not associated with
hemorrhagic events that required immediate medical at￾tention. As expected for a platelet function inhibitor,
there were more hemorrhagic AEs with prasugrel; how￾ever, the majority was mild and none resulted in serious
adverse events or adverse events leading to study drug
or study discontinuation. However, it bears emphasis that
exclusion criteria were conservative, enrolled subjects were
at low risk for hemorrhage and this pilot study was of short
duration.
Evidence of platelet inhibition was seen amongst
prasugrel-treated patients with SCD. Prasugrel treatment
resulted in approximately 33% to 40% platelet inhibition
as measured by both VerifyNowW P2Y12 and VASP,
suggesting that patients with SCD achieved a substantial
pharmacodynamic response with prasugrel treatment
similar to that seen in previous studies in patients with
cardiovascular disease. Despite this effect, it was still

possible that the marked hemostatic and inflammatory
milieu in SCD patients might have overcome potential
inhibition of platelet activation by prasugrel via other
platelet activation pathways, such as thrombin gener￾ation. However, the decreased levels in cellular and sol￾uble markers of platelet activation observed in the
prasugrel-treated group show this agent is able to over￾come this platelet pro-stimulatory environment and at￾tenuate in vivo platelet activation in SCD without
producing serious bleeding.
Perhaps more provocative is the suggestion that
prasugrel may be efficacious in reducing pain. The trad￾itional endpoint for therapeutic efficacy in SCD is the
occurrence of acute painful episodes (pain that requires
an unscheduled visit to a medical facility for treatment).
However, paradigm shifting work by Smith et al. [27,28].
has shown that chronic pain is common in patients with
SCD. Therefore, reductions in pain rate (the proportion
of days with pain) and pain intensity over time are im￾portant endpoints for SCD therapy to assess efficacy in
treating the different types of pain problems experienced
in this patient population. A numerical decrease in pain
rate and intensity compared with placebo, as reported by
daily patient diaries, was seen in this study. There was
also a numerical decrease in acute pain episodes
compared with placebo. Neither of these decreases
reached statistical significance, and this pilot study was
not designed to provide definitive conclusions regarding
pain. However, the number of patients who reported
days with zero pain was different. This latter finding was
intriguing, as it is a measurement of reduction of both
acute pain episodes and chronic pain and was seen after
only 30 days of treatment, a more rapid time to response
than seen with hydroxyurea [1].
It is important to compare and contrast the results of
this study to the other published studies of platelet

inhibitors in SCD. Osamo et al. examined the effect of
aspirin on red cell survival in patients with SCD [15].
Fifty patients aged 11–20 years with HbSS were assigned
to 1200 mg daily of soluble aspirin in divided doses for
6 weeks; another 50 were assigned to usual care only.
Hemoglobin and oxygen saturation levels increased in the
treated group, and red cell survival increased in the 3
patients in whom it was studied. They also demonstrated a
shift in the electrophoretic mobility of HbS in the aspirin￾treated patients indicating chemical modification of HbS.
Pain was not formally assessed in this study, and no serious
hemorrhagic events were reported.
Greenberg et al. studied somewhat lower doses of as￾pirin (3–6 mg/kg) for 21 months in 49 children with
HbSS, HbSC, or HbSO-Arab in a double-blind cross￾over study to prevent acute pain crises [29]. Ninety-four
patients were originally enrolled but analysis was per
protocol: only 49 that were determined to be at least
50% adherent with the study drug were included in the
analysis cohort. There was no difference in the number
of painful episodes, number of total days in pain, dur￾ation of pain crisis, or pain severity during crisis between
the aspirin- and placebo-treated periods. Interestingly,
there was a marked decrease in the number of pain cri￾ses after the first 6 months on-study, irrespective of the
treatment assignment.
Chaplin and colleagues added the phosphodiesterase
inhibitor dipyridamole to aspirin as prophylaxis for acute
pain crisis [30]. This study included only 3 patients
treated with aspirin 650 mg PO and dipyridamole 50 mg
PO both twice daily and compared the frequency and se￾verity of pain for the 2 years on therapy to the 2 years
not on therapy. The severity of pain appeared to be less
while on therapy, and the total number of hospitalizations
for pain decreased as well.

and colleagues assessed platelet survival in 9 patients with
SCD using radiolabeled platelets and platelet activation by
measuring plasma levels of platelet release products [17].
Patients were randomized to placebo or ticlopidine
250 mg PO twice daily for 28 days. Ticlopidine did not
prolong platelet survival but did decrease markers of
platelet activation, as was seen in our study. They noted
an approximate 40% reduction in collagen and ADP￾induced maximal platelet aggregation. The inhibition
of platelet function and relative reduction in markers of
platelet activation is similar, in degree, to that seen in the
present study using different assays. One patient had a
painful episode while on active drug, but clearly this study
was not powered to determine a difference in pain. Ad￾verse events were not reported.
Cabannes et al. studied the efficacy of ticlopidine in
the prevention of acute pain crisis in 140 patients in
Africa [6]. Patients were randomized 1:1 between
ticlopidine 500 mg to 750 mg daily (dependent on body
weight) or placebo for 6 months of therapy. Although

severity cannot be discerned from the report, all three of
these parameters were statistically significantly decreased
in the ticlopidine arm compared with the placebo arm.
No platelet activation or survival markers were assessed.
Our study showed similar effects on platelet activation
to those demonstrated with ticlopidine, confirming its
platelet suppressive effect in this population of patients
without provoking clinically serious bleeding. It is im￾portant to note that the current Phase 2 study was not
powered to find a difference in acute painful episodes.
Nonetheless, there was a trend toward decreased number
of days with pain. Treatment with prasugrel compared
with placebo was associated with numerical decreases in
pain rate and pain intensity, as reported in daily patient
diaries, and a numerical decrease in pain events related to
SCD that required medical attention, as assessed by the
study investigator. In adjusted analyses, prasugrel was
associated with a 21% relative reduction in the percentage
of days with pain and a 25% relative reduction in pain in￾tensity compared with placebo.
Although it is clear from the patient pain diaries that
the majority of patients had pain at some point during
the study and many of the patients randomized to
placebo experienced chronic pain, relatively few patients
sought medical attention for their pain (27%). From the
case report forms, 22.5% of prasugrel-treated patients
sought medical attention for a pain event versus 36.8%
of placebo-treated patients. These provide a signal that
prasugrel may be efficacious in reducing the frequency
and severity of VOC in patients with SCD.
Conclusion
In summary, the results of this randomized, double￾blind, Phase 2 study showed that prasugrel inhibited
platelet function, decreased biomarkers of platelet acti￾vation, and showed a trend toward decreased pain by
several measures without serious hemorrhagic adverse
events. However, these results must be interpreted with
caution, as measures of pain were not primary outcomes
and the duration of this study (30 days) was short. A lar￾ger study with a sample size appropriately powered to
determine effects on clinically relevant endpoints and
provide longer safety analysis is needed to confirm and
extend these findings.
