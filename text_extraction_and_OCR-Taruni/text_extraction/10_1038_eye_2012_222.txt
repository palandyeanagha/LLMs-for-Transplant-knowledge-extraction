Abstract
Purpose (1) To describe the clinical
characteristics of Purtscher and Purtscher-like
retinopathies, including etiologies,
fundoscopic signs, results of complementary
investigation, treatments, and outcomes.
(2) To compare visual acuity (VA) of patients
receiving corticosteroids for PuR compared
with observation.
Methods Systematic review of several
databases (1980–2010): Medline, EMBASE,
ISI, EBSCO, Science Direct and Google
Scholar. Study selection criteria included: (A)
Studies of PuR with ophthalmology
assessments; (B) Z3 of 5 diagnostic criteria
of PuR; (C) Quantified VA at presentation.
For quantitative assessment (purpose 2),
we selected only studies that reported
whether corticosteroids were administered,
and with vision assessments after at least
1 month.
Results (1) From 670 studies initially found,
40 were included (68 cases, 110 eyes): 1
prospective, 5 case series, and 34 case reports.
Mean VA at presentation was 1.3 logMAR
(logarithm of the minimum angle of
resolution) (o20/200; range: 20/20-light
perception). Purtscher flecken were
underreported. Trauma and acute pancreatitis
were the most frequent etiologies. There
were six deaths, all with systemic
associations. (2) There was no statistically
significant difference between VA
improvement for patients treated with
corticosteroids compared with observation.
Visual prognostic factors identified included
etiology (pancreatitis and trauma were
associated with higher probability of visual
improvement) and male gender.
Conclusion Due to limitations of case
reports and series, the presented data are
only useful as broad characterizations of the
clinical course of PuR. Further studies,
possibly including trials to assess the
effectiveness of corticosteroids use, and
larger prospective cohort studies, are
necessary, but may not be feasible to
conduct.

Introduction
Purtscher’s retinopathy is an occlusive
microvasculopathy associated with trauma. It
was first described in 1910 by Otmar Purtscher1
in a middle-aged man who fell off a tree and
suffered cranial trauma. There is some doubt
about the incidence of this pathology; authors
have estimated its incidence at 0.24 persons per
million per year (including Purtscher and
Purtscher-like retinopathies)2 while others
believe that the incidence is higher because the
condition may frequently be asymptomatic.3
Bilaterality is present in up to 60% of cases.
Purtscher’s retinopathy generally occurs as a
result of cranial trauma or thoracic compression.
When there is a non-traumatic etiology, the
correct designation is Purtscher-like
retinopathy. Frequent causes of Purtscher-like
retinopathy include acute pancreatitis, renal
failure, and autoimmune disease. Purtscher-like
retinopathy in acute pancreatitis is an indicator
of multiorgan failure and is often associated
with a fatal outcome.3
The diagnosis of Purtscher’s and Purtscher￾like retinopathies (PuR) is clinical, with a
presentation that usually includes sudden
vision loss of variable severity, hours to days
after the causal pathology. Fundoscopic signs
include cotton-wool spots and intraretinal
hemorrhages, described in 83–92% of a series of
cases.4 Purtscher flecken are considered to be
pathognomonic,4 but occur in only 50% of cases.

It is widely assumed that the flecken are the result of
occlusion of the precapillary arterioles. The characteristic
finding is intraretinal whitening but with a clear zone
(within 50 mm) on either side of the retinal arterioles,
venules, and precapillary arterioles. This is in contrast to
cotton-wool spots, which have ill-defined edges,4,5 and
are located superficially over vessels. Fluorescein
angiography may show leakage of dye from retinal
arterioles, capillaries, and venules in patients with
relatively mild Purtscher’s retinopathy. Arteriolar
obstruction is noted in more severe cases. There are many
theories about pathogenesis but typically Purtscher’s
microangiopathy is thought to be due to precapillary
occlusion, due to fat emboli, leukoaggregation, or other
mechanisms.
Treatment is variable with some physicians observing
expectantly and others primarily administering
corticosteroids. There have been non-systematic reviews
of Purtscher’s retinopathy;6,7 however, no recent
systematic review has been performed. There is a need
for an updated systematic review of Purtscher’s
retinopathy given ongoing controversies regarding
treatment, and due to further published cases since prior
reviews.
We present a systematic review of Purtscher’s
retinopathy and Purtscher-like retinopathies. Part one of
this review will describe the clinical characteristics of
PuR, namely: clinical presentation, causal/associated
pathologies, results of diagnostic testing, treatments
performed, and clinical outcomes.
In part two of this review, our goal is to assess visual
acuity (VA) changes of patients receiving corticosteroids
compared with those without treatment (main outcome).
Secondary comparisons between groups include an
assessment of clinical changes and prognostic factors.
Materials and methods
Search methods
The search methodology was guided by the Cochrane
Collaboration’s recommendations.8 Two independent
reviewers, AM and FH, examined each title and abstract
to exclude obviously irrelevant reports. They then
independently examined the full text of each article to
determine eligibility according to the noted selection
criteria below. Disagreements were solved by consensus
and registered to allow assessment of reliability using the
kappa statistics.
Electronic searches included the following databases:
Medline (via Pubmed)—1950 to May 2010, EMBASE—
1974 to May 2010; ISI—2000 to May 2010, and other
databases via EBSCO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar.
We also searched clinicaltrials.gov and Current
Controlled Trials (in www.controlled-trials.com).
The search query for Pubmed was ‘(Purtscher[tiab] OR
Purtscher-like[tiab] OR angiopat*[tiab]) AND
retinopath*[tiab]’; similar searches were adjusted to each
database. All searches were made from 1 to 4 May 2010.
No publication date or language exclusions were made.
We also hand-searched reference books, journals, and
bibliographies from relevant papers. We mailed (or sent
letters) to experts in the field for help in identifying the
unpublished data and gray literature to avoid
publication bias.
Selection criteria
Inclusion criteria were
- Case reports, case series or trials meeting predeter￾mined quality criteria, based on the Cochrane Collabora￾tion,8 STARD,9 and STROBE.10
- Patients that matched at least three of five diagnostic
PuR criteria (adapted from several papers4,7,8):
1. Purtscher flecken
2. Retinal hemorrhages, low-to-moderate number (1–10)
3. Cotton-wool spots (typically restricted to posterior
pole)
4. Probable or plausible explanatory etiology
5. Complementary investigation compatible with
diagnosis
- Quantified VA at presentation.
- Follow-up by an ophthalmologist with fundoscopic
evaluation, at least one month after initial diagnosis.
For the assessment of corticosteroid efficacy in PuR, we
only included studies that fulfilled another two inclusion
criteria: studies with follow-up at 1 month (with all
assessments and VAs registered), and studies reporting
whether corticosteroids were administered (if studies did
not explicitly note corticosteroids use for each patient,
then they were excluded).
Exclusion criteria included: duplicate reports, studies
without follow-up, and studies without examinations
performed by an ophthalmologist. To avoid language
bias, publication language was not an exclusion criteria.
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers, AM and FH, independently collected
data and assessed quality. A form was developed
specifically for this project to assist in consistent data
collection from each study. This form included: year of
publication, author’s name, as well as each subject’s age,
gender, retinal pathology, etiology of retinopathy, and
laterality, VA at presentation (VA0); VA at 1 month (VA1);

VA at 2 months(VA2); VA at 6 months(VA6), diagnostic
criteria of PuR, signs and results of tests, and treatment
(including dosing and administration route). The
investigators had clear coding instructions.
If VA was not recorded in the logarithm of the
minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) scale,11 then it
was converted. Snellen VA scores were converted to the
logMAR for statistical analyses, using the calculation:
logMAR value ¼ log10 (1/Snellen). VA scores below
Snellen 20/400 were assigned as counting fingers
(logMAR value of 1.7), hand motion (logMAR value of
2.5), and light perception (logMAR value of 3.0).
Where necessary, authors were contacted by E-mail4,12–32
or letter1,32 to provide further data (some responses
were received12,14,17). Some studies required
translation.15,20,33–40
Quality evaluation graphs were made using Review
Manager v5 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Data
were collected as part of the quality evaluation process:
description of the study design, description of patient
demographics, diagnostic criteria used to define PuR, VA
testing method, description of results, follow-up
examinations made by an ophthalmologist, and follow￾up duration.
Quantitative data synthesis
All analyses were performed using Excel for simple
calculations or SPSS (SPSS Inc., version 17.0, Chicago, IL,
USA). Disagreements regarding study inclusion were
calculated using kappa statistics.
Subgroup analyses previously planned were
performed: corticosteroid use vs no use; presence/
absence of associated pathology.
We tried to identify prognostic factors associated with
VA improvement, using Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables, including: etiology of PuR, gender, bilaterality,
presence or absence of Purtscher flecken, presence or
absence of retinal edema, and results of complementary
tests. Results and features of complementary tests
searched included: (1) fluorescein angiography (non￾perfusion, early hypofluorescence, delayed filling,
peripapillary staining, generalized ischemia, and
abnormalities present after 1 month); (2) OCT (retinal
edema, atrophy after 1 month); (3) visual field (scotoma,
visual field alterations after 1 month); (4) visual evoked
potentials changes; and (5) Electroretinogram changes.
Univariate analyses of normally distributed
continuous variables were performed using Student’s
t-test. Independent samples Mann–Whitney test was
used for continuous variables without normal
distribution (all variables were tested for normality using
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). Since there were cases of
bilateral Purtscher, we ran three separate analyses:
analysis of each involved eye (‘all-eyes’), comparison of
eyes with best VA (‘best-eye’), and worst VA (‘worst￾eye’). Best eye and worst eye analyses included cases of
unilateral PuR. Significance was accepted at 0.05.
Results
The Pubmed search yielded 232 studies; EMBASE
yielded 169 results; ISI 89, EBSCO 90 and Google Scholar
and hand searching yielded 90 articles. Of the total 670
articles, 65 studies were selected for a full-text review
(Figure 1). For study inclusion, kappa was 0.88 (good
agreement). In all, 40 studies that included 68 cases
(involving 110 eyes) were included for our descriptive
review; and 23 studies (with 24 cases and 35 eyes) were
included for the quantification of VA improvement and
response to corticosteroid therapy.
Demographic details
Characteristics of included studies. The characteristics of
the 40 included studies are summarized in Table 1. Most
studies were case reports, although some were case series
and one was a prospective study.2
Characteristics of patients. The mean patient age was 34
years (minimum 11 weeks and maximum 76 years) and
60% were male. The mean time of follow-up was 20.3
months (with a minimum of 30 days and maximum of 96
months).

Systemic associations of PuR
Table 2 presents the relative frequency of associated
pathology in each patient with PuR; the most frequent
being trauma, followed by acute pancreatitis. Death
occurred in 6 (out of 68 PuR cases) patients, 2 with
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), of 5 cases
of TTP. Of those five patients with TTP, only one had
unilateral involvement. All cases related to pregnancy
and TTP were bilateral. Only one case of acute
pancreatitis had unilateral Purtscher-like retinopathy.
Clinical signs of PuR at baseline and follow-up
The most frequently encountered signs of PuR were
cotton-wool spots which occurred in 63/68 (93%) of
cases, followed by retinal hemorrhages (44/68, 65%), and
by Purtscher flecken (43/68, 63%).
Of the 43 cases with Purtscher flecken, 8 were correctly
reported (Purtscher flecken were reported and a picture
was presented with that sign), 22 cases were not reported
by authors but identified during image assessments by
reviewers as part of this study, and 13 cases were
reported but no photograph was provided. Ten cases
presented a picture without Purtscher flecken and
correctly did not report it. Fifteen cases had no report of
Purtscher flecken and did not present a photograph.
Occasionally, there were other signs at presentation,
such as macular edema (22%), optic disk swelling (16%),
and a pseudo cherry red spot (26%).
Fundoscopic findings after 2 months follow-up were
reported in 22 cases and included: normalization of the
retinal appearance (9/22, 40%), optic atrophy (14/22,
64%), mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium (5/22,
23%), retinal thinning (3/22, 14%), and narrowing of
retinal arteries (1/22, 4%). Some cases had several signs
(the most frequent combination was optic atrophy with
mottling of retinal pigment epithelium).
Fluorescein angiography was performed in 31 cases
(45.5% of patients and showed: areas of non-perfusion
(22/31, 70%), retinal ischemia (22/31, 70%), early
hypofluorescence (6/31, 20%), slower filling of vessels
(14/31, 45%), late leakage (6/31, 20%), peripapillary
staining (5/31, 16%), and precapillary occlusion (2/31,
6.7%).
Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in
eight cases at presentation and showed retinal edema in
seven cases and slight thickening in the other case. OCT
findings after 1 month were performed in seven cases
showing normalization in five cases and macular atrophy
in two cases (both with severe macular edema at
presentation).

2 cases had also a nasal step and another had an arcuate
scotoma and nasal step. Further visual field testing after
1 month of follow-up was performed in 11 cases, with
normalization in 1 case, scotoma enlargement in 1 case,
persistent defect in 6 cases, and partial improvement in
the remaining 3 cases.
Visual evoked potentials were performed in three cases,
showing increased latency and decreased amplitude of
responses (two cases) or no alteration (one case); after 1
month, one case improved partially and the other did
not. Electroretinogram was performed at presentation in
two cases, both demonstrating depression of the a and b
waves. Electroretinogram after first month of follow-up
was performed in five cases (including the two studied at
baseline): one showed normalization, one showed
persistent defect; the remaining (not studied at baseline)
showed subnormal results.
Risk of bias assessment
We performed a quality evaluation/general risk of bias
assessment of all studies; however, we present results of
only the studies included for quantitative analysis to
identify and reduce methodological heterogeneity.
In Figure 2, we present the summary of our quality
evaluation of included studies, according to each
parameter assessed—risk of bias graph. Most studies had
low risk of bias in the description of results but not in the
quantification of VA. In fact, there was a high risk of bias
in VA quantification (at 1, 2, and 6 months), which adds
heterogeneity. Few studies reported strategies to prevent
selection bias, information bias, or other bias. Risk of bias

Quantitative analysis
VA is reported at 1, 2, and 6 months because almost all
studies reported those time points. Studies that did not
report corticosteroid use or that had a follow-up of o1
month were excluded. Consequently, of 40 studies that
were included in the descriptive review (purpose 1), only
24 cases (from 23 studies) were selected for quantitative
analysis (purpose 2). From these, 12 cases reported VA at
1 month, 10 cases reported VA at 2 months, and 11 cases
reported VA at 6 months (final VA).
VA at presentation and after follow-up. According to our
‘best-eye’ analysis, mean VA at presentation was 1.5
logMAR (equivalent to o20/200) with standard
deviation of 0.75; this value had extreme variability (20/
20 to light perception). Our ‘worst-eye’ analysis showed
similar values. In the ‘best-eye’ analysis, the mean final
VA improvement was 0.85 logMAR (equivalent to 0.13 in
decimal scale) with standard deviation of 0.82; in ‘worst￾eye’ was 0.96 logMAR (SD ¼ 0.80); in ‘all-eyes’ was 0.91
logMAR (SD ¼ 0.86).
VA according to associated pathology. VA at presentation
according to etiology is represented in Figure 3. Cases
associated with Valsalva and coil-embolization of carotid
aneurism25 presented with the best VA (logMAR ¼ 0),
while cases of PuR associated with pregnancy or lupus
presented the worst (respectively 1.90 and 1.70
logMAR).
The highest VA mean improvement occurred in acute
pancreatitis (1.23 logMAR; SD ¼ 1.10) and in trauma (1.35
logMAR; SD ¼ 0.78).
VA improvement in corticosteroid vs no corticosteroid
use. There was no statistically significant difference in
VA improvement between patients receiving
corticosteroids vs no corticosteroids, at 1, 2, or 6 months
of follow-up (Fisher’s exact test, P ¼ 0.332 at 6 months in
‘best-eye’ analysis; P ¼ 0.356 in ‘all-eyes’; P ¼ 1in ‘worst￾eye’).
Bilateral Purtscher retinopathy. There was no statistically
significant difference between VA or VA improvement of
left or right eye, at presentation, at 1 month, at 2 months,
or at 6 months of follow-up (2 related samples non￾parametric t-test) in the 14 bilateral cases.
Prognostic factors. There were six deaths among all
cases. Systemic etiologies with fatal outcomes were
cancer (two deaths in two patients), thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (two deaths in five patients),
cryoglobulinemia (one death in three patients), and
Figure 3 Mean visual acuity at presentation according to etiology. In logMAR scale, 0 is equivalent to normal VA; the higher the value
of logMAR, the worse is VA.

lupus (one death in two patients). Death was not
associated with initial VA (Mann–Whitney test for initial
VA vs death). Five of these deaths occurred within 3
weeks of PuR diagnosis.
As for prognostic factors for VA improvement, we
identified, in the ‘best-eye’ analysis male gender was
associated with better VA improvement at 2 months
(P ¼ 0.018, Fisher’s exact test) and at 6 months (P ¼ 0.041,
Fisher’s test) but not at 1 month (P ¼ 0.333). This was
similar for the ‘worst-eye’ analysis (P2 months ¼ 0.036;
P6 months ¼ 0.038) and ‘all-eyes’ (P2 months ¼ 0.011;
P6 months ¼ 0.004) analyses.
Etiology of PuR may be associated with VA
improvement at 1 month and 2 months, particularly in
trauma and acute pancreatitis (‘best-eye’ with Fisher’s
test with P ¼ 0.010 and P ¼ 0.002, respectively) but not
with VA improvement at 6 months. Results were similar
for ‘worst-eye’ (P1m ¼ 0.015; P2m ¼ 0.515; P6m ¼ 0.612) and
‘all-eyes’ (P1m ¼ 0.001; P2m ¼ 0.294; P6m ¼ 0.140)
analyses.
According to ‘all-eyes’ analysis (but neither ‘best-eye’
nor ‘worst-eye’), absence of macular edema was associated
with higher VA improvement at 2 months (P ¼ 0.029; but
neither at 1 nor at 6 months); and absence of pseudo
cherry red spot with better VA improvement at 6 months
(P ¼ 0.017).
Poor prognostic factors for visual improvement such as
choroidal hypoperfusion, optic disc swelling,7 or massive
Purtscher flecken18 were not statistically significant, but
only a small number of cases presented with these
findings.
Discussion
This systematic review provides an up-to-date,
comprehensive assessment of the literature regarding
Purtscher’s retinopathy. Efforts have been made to build
a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the
available data, which is of relatively low quality.
Purtscher flecken were reported in 23% but were
visible in 63% of the fundus images available in each
report (identified by reviewers). The relatively poor
identification of Purtscher flecken by authors of included
papers suggests that attention should be paid to
recognize and document this particular characteristic of
PuR, since it is pathognomonic. On the other hand, this
particular sign is not of prognostic value.
Visual prognostic factors identified included etiology
(pancreatitis and trauma associated with higher
probability of visual improvement). Male gender was
also a good prognostic factor; however, this may be due
to higher preponderance of males in etiologies of good
prognostic value (like trauma); we had insufficient
power to run a subgroup analysis to clarify this issue.
Unlike other studies that discussed prognostic factors for
PuR,18 we did not find any fundoscopic or angiographic
sign of prognostic value for VA improvement.
Only one third of the initial studies presented VA data
after follow-up. We would like to emphasize the
importance of reporting clinical signs and VA in future
studies of PuR not only for the time of presentation but
also after follow-up, to better understand the behavior of
this pathology over time.
Limitations of this review include the preponderance
of clinical cases and series from which our data were
derived. In spite of the quality evaluation performed for
each study, in case reports there is no unified
methodology, which limits the comparability. In the case
of VA, not all studies reported vision at consistent time
points, as a result, all of these values are considered to be
an estimate. On the other hand, in rare pathologies such
as PuR in which there are no trials, a systematic review of
clinical cases is a valid adapted methodology.
In addition, there may be publication bias and
misclassification bias among the included studies.
Therefore, the value of our quantitative analysis is
limited and should be interpreted with caution.
Nonetheless, there certainly appears to be a definite
trend toward improved vision within the first 2 months
following onset of Purtscher’s.
As previously stated, it is agreed that diagnosis of PuR
is clinical, being confirmed by angiography. However,
the biologic mechanism of injury remains uncertain.
Histopathological studies show signs of retinal
vascular occlusion with edema of retinal internal layers,
subretinal cystoid space, and abrupt transition to normal
retina.5,41
There are several theories that have been forwarded
since the initial mechanical theory.1 The most currently
accepted is microembolization, causing arteriolar
precapillary occlusion and microvascular infarct of
retinal nerve fiber layer, forming cotton-wool spots.5,7,16
This could be due to a fat emboli (typically described in
long bone fracture42) or due to pancreatic proteases in
systemic circulation (typically described in acute
pancreatitis34,43).
Leukoembolization by leukocytary aggregation and C5
complement activation with secondary lymph
extravasation7,44 is another proposed mechanism (also
supported by some experimental studies45). Other
pathogenic processes that may be involved include
capillary endothelial damage (supported by late leakage
in IVFA16), sudden increase of intracranial pressure
(causing precapillary occlusion in lamina crivosa43,46),
sudden expansion of retinal veins,7 or hyperviscosity
(such as in multiple myeloma47). A recent study used
computer dynamic flow simulations and suggested an
additional mechanism: an inner layer retinal posterior

pole rheological event that results in vascular endothelial
dysregulation.48 Probably, these mechanisms are not
mutually exclusive and there is some overlap in the final
mechanism: precapillary arterioles occlusion by altered
retinal microvascular permeability.2–4,7
Regarding treatment, several articles and reviews such
as our own did not find corticosteroid treatment
associated with a statistically significant improvement in
outcome.1,2,5 Observation and treatment of the
underlying etiology may be the most reasonable
therapeutic option without risk of adverse drug effects.
However, since some case reports showed hastened
visual recovery after corticosteroids use,2,49 further
information is needed to determine if corticosteroids can
or cannot change the natural history of a patient with
Purtscher’s retinopathy. Visual improvement in those
cases has been attributed to the ability of corticosteroids
to stabilize damaged neuronal membrane and
microvascular channels, and to inhibit granulocyte
aggregation related to complement activation.7,50
Eventually, a trial (preferably masked) with
corticosteroids in PuR could be considered to end
controversies about the need of this treatment. Preferably,
a natural history cohort study might be the most
reasonable first step. The biggest barrier to any
prospective study design is the small frequency of this
pathology, estimated as 0.24 per million.2 Ultimately, a
National or International Study might be necessary.
Also, to estimate the real incidence and to identify
asymptomatic cases of PuR (which are of relatively high
frequency3,51), more screening should be done in patients
identified to be at risk. This study may assist in the
identification of such individuals. In all cases, evaluation
by an ophthalmologist is essential. Follow-up is crucial as
well, and should have defined timelines (we suggest
measuring VA at presentation, at 1 month, at 2 months,
and at 6 months) using a standard methodology. We
recommend diagnostic criteria for Purtscher’s retinopathy
(similar to the one used by Agrawal2 and adapted by us).
