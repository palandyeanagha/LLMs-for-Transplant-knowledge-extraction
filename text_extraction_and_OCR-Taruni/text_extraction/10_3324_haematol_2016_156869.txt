Abstract
Although the primary origin of sickle cell disease is a hemoglobin
disorder, many types of cells contribute considerably to the
pathophysiology of the disease. The adhesion of neutrophils to
activated endothelium is critical in the pathophysiology of sickle
cell disease and targeting neutrophils and their interactions with
endothelium represents an important opportunity for the
development of new therapeutics. We focused on endothelin-1, a
mediator involved in neutrophil activation and recruitment in
tissues, and investigated the involvement of the endothelin
receptors in the interaction of neutrophils with endothelial cells. We
used fluorescence intravital microscopy analyses of the


microcirculation in sickle mice and quantitative microfluidic
fluorescence microscopy of human blood. Both experiments on the
mouse model and patients indicate that blocking endothelin
receptors, particularly ETB receptor, strongly influences neutrophil
recruitment under inflammatory conditions in sickle cell disease.
We show that human neutrophils have functional ETB receptors
with calcium signaling capability, leading to increased adhesion to
the endothelium through effects on both endothelial cells and
neutrophils. Intact ETB function was found to be required for tumor
necrosis factor α-dependent upregulation of CD11b on neutrophils.
Furthermore, we confirmed that human neutrophils synthesize
endothelin-1, which may be involved in autocrine and paracrine
pathophysiological actions. Thus, the endothelin-ETB axis should be
considered as a cytokine-like potent pro-inflammatory pathway in
sickle cell disease. Blockade of endothelin receptors, including ETB,
may provide major benefits for preventing or treating vaso-
occlusive crises in sickle cell patients.
Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy resulting
from a unique mutation in the β-globin gene. SCD is characterized
by hemolytic anemia, painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) and
progressive organ failure. Although red blood cell dysfunction is the
major contributor to disease development and progression, other
types of cells, which are not affected by the genetic mutation
(endothelial cells, leukocytes, platelets21), are also key actors in the
pathophysiology of SCD. Several studies have highlighted the
important role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (neutrophils),
both during an acute VOC3 and in the associated long-term
morbidity and mortality.4 Interestingly, a high, steady-state,
peripheral white cell count is a risk factor for both significant
morbidity – stroke, pulmonary complications, nephropathy – and
early SCD-related death.84
The central role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of SCD has
recently been explored.93 In vitro studies have shown that,
compared to neutrophils from healthy controls, neutrophils from
SCD patients have an increased expression of adhesion
molecules,1210 rendering them more susceptible to inflammatory


stimuli.13 A relationship between clinical manifestations of SCD
and the expression of adhesion molecules on neutrophils has also
been reported.142 It is likely that activated neutrophils engage in a
complex process of abnormal interactions between activated
endothelial cells, platelets and circulating red blood cells
contributing to decreased blood flow and to endothelial injury. This
further accentuates erythrocyte sickling, neutrophil recruitment and
tissue ischemia.9 Targeting the mechanisms of neutrophil-
endothelial cell interactions would, therefore, represent a novel and
potentially important therapeutic opportunity in SCD.
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most potent endogenous
vasoconstrictor.15 It is released by activated endothelial16 and non-
endothelial cells17 in response to hypoxia and reduced nitric oxide
bioavailability in several animal models.18 The effects of ET-1 are
mediated via two receptors, the ETA and ETB receptors.15 We
previously found that mixed ETA/B receptor antagonism has
profound effects on organ injury and mortality in a mouse model of
SCD.19 In addition to inhibition of tonic ET-1-dependent
vasoconstriction during experimental VOC, we also observed an
unexpected but powerful inhibition of neutrophil recruitment in the
lungs and kidneys although we could not link this effect to a direct
action of ET-1 receptors on neutrophil-endothelial interactions. We,
therefore, hypothesized that activation of ET receptors might
promote a pathogenic pro-inflammatory role for neutrophils in SCD.
In the present study, we combined intravital videomicroscopy of the
microcirculation in a murine model of SCD with quantitative
microfluidic fluorescence microscopy of human blood to investigate
the involvement of ET receptors in the interaction of neutrophils
with endothelial cells.
Methods
Animal model
Animals were used in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH
publication n. 85-23) and the study protocol was approved by the
French ministry of agriculture. SAD1 (SAD) Hbβ single/single


hemizygous mice were used in this study. This strain harbors a
recombinant hβ-globin gene construct expressing human
hemoglobin SAD (A2β2SAD), which contains two mutations
[Antilles (β23I) and D-Punjab (β121Q)] in addition to the βS6V
mutation.2019 This strain is bred on the C57BL/6J genetic
background (with more than 30 backcrosses).
Intravital videomicroscopy: experimental protocol
The complete protocol is described in the Online Supplementary
Methods and illustrated in Online Supplementary Figure S1. ETA
antagonist (BQ123, A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA or ETB
antagonist (BQ788, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) were injected 10
min before (10 mg/kg) and 3 h 15 min after (5 mg/kg) intrascrotal
injection of 0.5 μg tumor necrosis factor (TNFα, R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) and neutrophils were monitored by
injection of labeled phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Ly6G antibody
(BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Sparks, MD, USA).
The neutrophil rolling flux fraction, adhesion density, adhesion
efficiency and transmigration were measured from 2.5 h to 5 h after
the TNFα injection at 30-min intervals.
Patients and healthy volunteers
The study was approved by the Ethical Evaluation Committee for
Biomedical Research Projects (CEERB) of Robert Debré Hospital,
France (n. 2014/155). All patients were included during a
scheduled medical consultation, at steady state. Blood samples were
collected from 2- to 18-year old patients with SCD (SS genotype),
and from young healthy adult donors (AA genotype) from the local
blood bank (Etablissement Français du Sang). Patients in a chronic
transfusion therapy program, those having received blood
transfusion in the 3 months preceding enrollment and those treated
with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) were excluded. Exceptions
were made for the quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses,
as mentioned below.
Human neutrophil preparation


Human neutrophils were isolated (98% purity) from fresh whole
blood within 4 h after blood sampling with EDTA as anticoagulant,
using a MACSxpress Neutrophil Isolation Kit followed by
MACSxpress Erythrocyte Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris,
France). Details on the flow adhesion assays are provided in the
Online Supplementary Methods.
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
ET-1, ETA and ETB mRNA levels were determined by real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction as described previously.21
Beta-2 microglobulin mRNA was used as a housekeeping gene The
relative expression of ET-1, ETA and ETB mRNA in neutrophils was
calculated following the ΔΔCt method,22 with the values obtained
in HMEC-1 as a reference.
Flow cytometry assessment of adhesion molecules
and intracellular Ca2+ measurements in neutrophils
Three hours after treatment with TNFα with or without ET receptor
antagonists, mice were anesthetized; blood was collected on EDTA
by intracardiac puncture and immediately processed for flow
cytometry staining for viability and CD11a, CD11b and CD62L
surface expression on Ly5G neutrophils (see Online Supplementary
Methods).
Isolated human neutrophils were fluorescently labeled with fluo-4-
acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-4-AM; Invitrogen). Neutrophils were
incubated with BQ123 or BQ788 (both from Sigma, Saint-Quentin
Fallavier, France) at 10 μmol/L for 15 min and analyzed
immediately by flow cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences,
Sparks, MD, USA). After 2 min of signal acquisition, the analysis
was interrupted for less than 10 s to add 100 nM of ET-1 (Sigma) to
the tube before the analysis was resumed.
Endothelin-1 immunoassay
Isolated neutrophils were incubated at 37°C in RPMI medium
supplemented with TNFα (10 ng/mL) for 2 h. Supernatants were
frozen at −80°C until assay. The concentration of ET-1 was


determined using a Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (R&D systems.
Flow adhesion assays
The experimental protocol is described in the Online Supplementary
Methods. Briefly, human neutrophils were stained in whole blood
with anti-CD16 antibody together with BQ123 (1 μM) or BQ788 (1
μM). The time between drawing blood and starting the anti-CD16
staining was always less than 3 h and reproducible. If more than 3 h
elapsed, samples were discarded. Whole blood samples were
perfused through biochip channels containing HMEC-1 monolayers
or coated recombinant proteins (P-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1).
Statistics
Results are presented as means plus or minus the standard error of
the mean (SEM), Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6
software by ANOVA with the Tukey test, Wilcoxon rank test and
Mann-Whitney test. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Acute ETA and ETB receptor antagonism does not
alter leukocyte blood count or microvascular
hemodynamics in wild-type and SAD mice
In keeping with clinical SCD, SAD mice (n=5) showed an increase
in circulating leukocytes with a neutrophil predominance compared
to wild-type (WT) littermate mice, both at baseline and after TNFα
administration (Online Supplementary Table S1). Treatment of TNFα-
challenged animals with either BQ123 or BQ788 did not affect any
of the peripheral cell counts. As changes in microvascular wall
shear stress may influence neutrophil adhesion, we determined the
effects of acute ETA and ETB receptor blockade on wall shear rate in
cremasteric venules. There were no significant differences in
venular wall shear rates between groups treated with TNFα +
vehicle, TNFα + BQ123 and TNFα + BQ788 (Online Supplementary


Table S2).
ETA and ETB receptors control neutrophil rolling in
inflamed venules
In WT mice, neither BQ123 nor BQ788 affected neutrophil rolling
flux throughout the time course of the experiment. As in WT mice,
ETA antagonism with BQ123 had no effect on neutrophil rolling
flux in SAD mice. In sharp contrast, ETB blockade with BQ788
profoundly inhibited neutrophil rolling flux in SAD mice, compared
to that in the vehicle-treated SAD group, throughout the experiment
(Figure 1A).

maximum intensity projection. Fifteen venules (5 mice) were
analyzed in each group [12 venules and 3 mice for control with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]. Data are presented as mean ±
SEM. Two-way ANOVA with the Tukey multiple comparison test.

ETA and ETB receptor antagonism decreases
neutrophil adhesion in inflamed venules from sickle
mice
Overall, in WT mice, neutrophil adhesion density was not
influenced by BQ123 or BQ788 treatment. Over the time course of
the study, adhesion decreased in all three groups of WT mice from
about 670 adherent neutrophils/mm at 2 h 30 min after the
inflammatory challenge to reach about 250 adherent neutrophils/
mm at 5 h. In SAD mice, the inflammatory challenge with TNFα
induced a marked increase in neutrophil adhesion compared to that
in the WT counterparts (1000 versus 586 adherent neutrophils/mm,
P<0.05). The adhesion remained elevated and stable for 90 min
and then decreased slightly. At the end of the experiment, adhesion
density in SAD mice challenged with TNFα was still increased
compared to that in WT challenged mice (731 versus 271 adherent
neutrophils/mm, P<0.05). In SAD mice, both ETA and ETB receptor
blockade markedly inhibited adhesion of neutrophils throughout
the time course of the study with the degree of adhesion being
similar to that observed in WT controls (Figure 1B).
To define the neutrophil adhesion better, we calculated the
efficiency of neutrophil adhesion as the ratio between adhering
neutrophils and those that are estimated to be available to adhere
(Figure 1C). We found that adhesion efficiency was, overall,
unaffected by BQ123 and BQ788 in WT mice. In contrast, adhesion
efficiency was markedly and significantly decreased in SAD mice
treated with BQ788 compared to that in the TNFα and vehicle-
treated SAD group throughout the time course of the experiment;
no significant differences were observed in SAD mice treated with
BQ123. Taken together, these data show a differential effect of ETA
versus ETB receptor antagonism on neutrophil adhesion (Figure 1C–
F).
ETA and ETB receptor antagonism decreases


neutrophil transmigration in inflamed venules from
sickle mice
We counted neutrophils that had migrated into the extravascular
space adjacent to the observed venules by optical sectioning (Online
Supplementary Figure S1, Figure 1G,H). TNFα-induced emigration of
neutrophils was significant in both groups of mice compared to the
emigration in animals treated with vehicle (phosphate-buffered
saline) but distinct kinetics were observed in SAD and WT animals.
While neutrophil emigration reached a plateau at 3 h 30 min in the
WT cremasteric microcirculation and subsequently resolved to
baseline values, sickle SAD mice experienced a more sustained and
more intense increase in emigration which was double that
measured in WT after 4 h and lasted until the end of the
experiments (Figure 1 G,H). In WT mice, TNFα-induced emigration
was significantly decreased by BQ123 and BQ788 administration
but only at early time points (∼2.3-fold decrease at 2 h 30 min,
P<0.01 for BQ123, ∼3.5-fold decrease at 2 h 30 min and ∼2.1-fold
decrease at 3 h for BQ788, P<0.001 versus vehicle-treated mice). In
SAD mice that displayed more intense and prolonged emigration of
neutrophils both ETA and ETB blockade significantly prevented
trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils to tissues, especially at
late points [BQ123: ∼2.3-fold decrease at 2 h 30 min (P<0.01
versus TNFα only-treated mice); BQ788: ∼3.5-fold decrease at 2 h
30 min (P<0.001 versus TNFα-treated mice) and ∼2.1-fold decrease
at 3 h (P<0.01 versus TNFα-treated mice)] (Figure 1H).
Representative images indicating less neutrophil recruitment in the
presence of ETA and ETB, particularly in SAD mice, are shown in
Figure 2.

(administered phosphate - buffered saline, PBS) or after local TNFα
stimulation associated or not with specific blocking of ETA or ETB
receptors. White arrows indicate emigrated neutrophils. Scale bars:
10 μm.


All these experiments suggest that blocking ET receptors influences
neutrophil recruitment in mice, especially in the context of
sustained and intense neutrophil recruitment specific to
experimental SCD.
ETA and ETB receptor antagonism reduces tumor
necrosis factor α-induced high CD11b/Mac1
expression on neutrophils and does not alter cell
viability
CD11b, also known as Mac-1α or integrin αM chain, is part of the
CD11b/CD18 heterodimer, also known as the C3 complement
receptor. Increased adhesion has been linked to engagement of
CD11b membrane expression on neutrophils from sickle mice.23
We, therefore, measured CD11b expression on neutrophils from
SAD and WT mice without or after TNFα administration. In the
latter case, we evaluated the effect of BQ123 and BQ788
antagonists 3 h after injection of TNFα or vehicle (phosphate-
buffered saline), when ET receptor antagonists displayed inhibitory
effects on neutrophil adhesion in intravital imaging experiments.
TNFα challenge induced a very significant upregulation of CD11b
expression in neutrophils from both WT and SAD animals within 3
h (Online Supplementary Figure S2). This effect was markedly
increased in neutrophils from SAD mice compared to that in WT
mice (+40 %, P<0.05). Both ET receptor antagonists limited
CD11b-associated mean fluorescence surface intensity and the
proportion of neutrophils with high CD11b expression in
neutrophils from TNFα-challenged SAD animals, whereas neither
antagonist had any effect on CD11b expression in normal mice
(Online Supplementary Figure S2). This suggests that involvement of
the ET system in pro-inflammatory CD11b upregulation and
neutrophil adhesion is specific to the SCD condition. No effect of
either TNFα or the ET receptor antagonists was observed on the
surface expression of CD11a and CD62L on neutrophils (Online
Supplementary Figure S2) and no difference in cell viability
(apoptosis or necrosis affected less than 3% of blood neutrophils)
was observed between the different groups (data not shown).
We next investigated the expression and the role of ET receptors on


human neutrophils from SCD patients and healthy controls.
ETA and ETB mRNA expression in neutrophils from
healthy volunteers and patients with sickle cell
disease
As very few studies report on the expression of ETB receptors in
neutrophils from normal individuals2624 and none in SCD patients,
we first investigated the expression of the EDNRA and EDNRB genes
encoding ETA and ETB, respectively, in endothelial cells (HMEC-1)
and in human neutrophils from SCD patients (SS) and healthy
individuals (AA). ETA and ETB mRNA are expressed both in
endothelial cells and in human neutrophils and at similar levels in
neutrophils isolated from healthy controls and SCD patients (Figure
3).
[image]
Figure 3.Endothelial cells and neutrophils from both healthy
controls (AA), and SCD patients (SS) express ETA and ETB
transcripts. Results of real time quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction are expressed as a comparison with ETA/
B mRNA transcripts in endothelial cells (HMEC-1) with the ΔΔCT
method. The reference gene used was the β2 microglobulin gene.
Results are means (± SEM) of eight independent samples (4
controls, 4 patients) in duplicate.
To complete these results and confirm the presence of functional ET
receptors on human neutrophils, we investigated the potential effect
of neutrophil stimulation on the ET-1-mediated calcium response.
Endothelin-1 elicits an ETB-mediated calcium
response in neutrophils from healthy controls and
individuals with sickle cell disease
Although ETA and ETB receptors have been shown to be expressed
on many cell types, their presence on the surface of neutrophils and
their signaling pathways are poorly understood. We investigated the
activation of a calcium-dependent signaling pathway in response to


stimulation with ET-1 (Figure 4A,B). In the presence of ET-1 in
neutrophils from both SCD individuals and healthy volunteers, we
found a rapid increase in intra-cytoplasmic calcium concentration,
which progressively decreased to steady state in less than 100 s.
The same experiment was performed with neutrophils pre-
incubated for 15 min with BQ123 or BQ788. Neither antagonist
altered baseline values (Figure 4C). ETA antagonism did not prevent
the ET-1-elicited calcium response (Figure 4A,C) whereas ETB
receptor antagonism provoked a significant reduction in the
calcium response after the addition of ET-1 both in AA and SS
neutrophils (Figure 4A,C). These results indicate the presence of a
functional ETB receptor on the surface of neutrophils.

were made. *P<0.05 vs. ET-1 + PBS.
We next investigated the potential secretion of ET-1 by human
neutrophils.


Endothelin-1 secretion by neutrophils from healthy
individuals and patients with sickle cell disease
We investigated the expression of preproET-1 mRNA in neutrophils
from healthy controls and SCD patients, and compared this to
expression levels in the endothelial HMEC-1 cell line. As shown in
Online Supplementary Figure S3, preproET-1 mRNA is significantly
expressed in neutrophils but at a much lower level than in
endothelial cells.
To confirm the ability of neutrophils to secrete ET-1, we measured
the concentration of ET-1 in the supernatant of isolated human
neutrophils activated or not by TNFα (Figure 5). We found
detectable concentrations of ET-1 in the supernatant of isolated
neutrophils at baseline (data not shown) and after stimulation with
TNFα. The level of extracellular ET-1 in the presence of TNFα was
higher in supernatants of neutrophils from SS individuals than those
from AA healthy controls (0.27 ± 0.15 pg/mL versus 1.64 ± 0.45
pg/mL respectively; P=0.033) and from SS patients treated with
hydoxycarbamide (0.20 ± 0.08 pg/mL; P=0.04) (Figure 5).

(AA), 9 SCD patients without hydroxycarbamide therapy (SS)].
Concentration is normalized for 107 neutrophils per condition.
*P<0.05 vs. AA.
These data highlight the ability of neutrophils to secrete ET-1,
which may then activate endothelial cells and neutrophils
themselves, with an autocrine and paracrine mechanism. Thus, we
next investigated the effects of ET receptor antagonists on human
neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells.
ETB receptor antagonism prevents neutrophil
adhesion to endothelial cells in controls and patients


with sickle cell disease
To mimic in vivo circulation accurately, we infused whole blood
onto a layer of activated endothelial cells under conditions of
laminar flow. Adhesion of neutrophils to TNFα-primed endothelium
was similar in controls and SCD patients (Figure 6A). As shown in
Figure 6B,C, ETA receptor antagonism with BQ123 did not affect
this. Conversely, adhesion of BQ788-treated neutrophils to
endothelial cells was decreased by 42% (± 26%) compared to the
adhesion of untreated neutrophils (P=0.0008) (Figure 6B,C). These
data indicate an unexpected stimulatory role for the ETB receptor in
human neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, paralleling that
observed in vivo in sickle mice.

treated blood. *P<0,05, ***P<0,001 with paired, non-parametric

ETB receptor antagonism prevents neutrophil
adhesion to endothelial cells through effects on both
endothelial cells and neutrophils
During the adhesion experiments described above, ET receptor
antagonists were added to whole blood, then infused directly onto
endothelial cells. We were not, therefore, able to exclude any
potential effect of the pharmacological antagonists on endothelial
cells. To discriminate between the effects of the antagonists on
endothelial and neutrophil ET receptors, we performed the same
experiments by incubating only endothelial cells with the two
selective antagonists. We found a 28% (±33%) significant decrease
in the adhesion of neutrophils following treatment of endothelial
cells with BQ788 (but not with BQ123) compared to the untreated
condition (P=0.02) (Figure 6D).
To study the specific effects of ETA and ETB antagonists on
leukocytes, we used a different protocol since it was not possible to
rinse the whole blood and totally exclude contact between the
antagonists and the endothelial cells. We therefore infused whole
blood directly onto channels coated with purified adhesion proteins
(P-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1). The results illustrated in Figure
6E show that neutrophil adhesion after incubation with BQ123 was
not different to that in the untreated condition. In contrast, there
was a 16% (±18%) decrease in the adhesion of neutrophils on
recombinant adhesion molecules after incubation with BQ788
compared to the untreated sample (P=0.03) (Figure 6E). We could
also rule out that ET-1 altered human and mouse neutrophil
viability as neither exogenous ET-1 nor ETA or ETB antagonists
altered the proportion of apoptotic and necrotic neutrophils in vitro
and in vivo, respectively (data not shown).
Overall these results indicate that activation of the ETB receptor
promotes neutrophil adhesion through action on two compartments:
endothelial cells and neutrophils.


Discussion
Polymorphonuclear neutrophils play a major role in the
pathogenesis of endothelial injury characteristic of conditions such
as ischemia-reperfusion and SCD.9 Sequestration of neutrophils into
the microvasculature is the essential initiating step in neutrophil
recruitment in inflammation and this exacerbates vaso-occlusion in
SCD.2 Neutrophils from SCD patients and mice are activated, and
show increased adhesion.112 The identification of specific
mediators of neutrophil recruitment in SCD is important given that
the broad spectrum and non-specific inhibition of neutrophil-
endothelium interactions may lead to an increased risk of bacterial
infections and trigger VOC and death.
Following studies indicating that the ET system is activated in SCD
individuals,3227 our group previously showed that ET receptor
antagonism not only blunts experimental VOC-associated
vasoconstriction but also substantially inhibits acute VOC-induced
increases of the numbers of peripheral blood total leukocytes (and
specifically neutrophils), neutrophil infiltration of the
bronchoalveolar space, renal and pulmonary myeloperoxidase
activity and organ damage.19 Furthermore, early studies suggested
that ET-1 acts on neutrophils by increasing intracellular free
calcium mobilization,33 N-formyl-L-methionyl- L-leucyl-L-
phenylalanine-mediated superoxide anion production,34 or
aggregation.35
We, therefore, hypothesized that the ET system may play a direct
role in neutrophil-endothelial interactions in SCD. We found that ET
receptors are involved in several steps of neutrophil microvascular
recruitment in SCD mice. Whereas rolling adhesion in sickle SAD
mice involves the ETB receptor alone, firm adhesion and post-
adhesive dynamic behavior with transmigration involve both the
ETA and ETB receptors. We also demonstrated an unexpected
stimulatory role for the ETB receptor in adhesion of human
neutrophils to endothelial cells under laminar flow conditions. Our
findings suggest a differential role for ET receptors between mice
and humans given that we found no pro-adhesive role for the ETA
receptor in human neutrophil adhesion, in contrast to the situation
in sickle mice.


Another feature was the more intense and prolonged neutrophil
adhesion to endothelial cells in vivo in sickle mice compared to
control mice, whereas no differences were found in human
neutrophil adhesion in vitro. Our study with human samples may
have lacked statistical power, given the greater variability in
neutrophil adhesion compared to that measured in mice. This might
be due to species specificities and greater genetic heterogeneity in
humans than in mice, a factor that should be taken into account
when translating animal studies into the clinical setting. One
limitation to the in vitro experiments was the lack of significant
matching of AA with SS individuals providing blood, due to ethical
constraints. Differences in models caused by in vitro manipulation of
human blood with phenotypic heterogeneity of cultured endothelial
cells should also be considered. Moreover, chronic in vivo exposure
of the endothelium to cytokines, products of hemolysis and blood
cell micro-vesicles may alter endothelial phenotype and trigger
expression of different patterns of adhesion molecules.36
Nevertheless, both murine and human models provide consistent
evidence for a powerful anti-adhesive role for ETB receptor
antagonism.
Our work also challenges the common opinion that adhesion of
neutrophils to endothelial cells is always increased in SCD subjects.
In fact, Fadlon et al., using a different approach (counting the
radioactivity associated with adherent extensively centrifuged,
washed and radio-labeled isolated neutrophils bound to layers of
human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a static condition), could
not show any difference in adhesion of neutrophils from 25 control
subjects and 25 patients out of crisis to untreated and TNF-treated
endothelial cells.12 Thus, our measurements of in-flow adhesion of
neutrophils in whole blood from six healthy control subjects and 12
patients are consistent with the seminal results of Fadlon et al. In
contrast, peripheral blood neutrophils from the majority of SCD
patients in crisis were more adhesive to cultured endothelial
monolayers than neutrophils from patients out of crisis or from
healthy control subjects. Likewise, TNFα−injected SCD mice
exhibited significant increases in neutrophil adhesion compared to
AS mice, as measured by multi-channel fluorescence intravital
microscopy analyses.372 In retrospect it is interesting to note that
despite the absence of anemia in young animals, the SAD mouse


model still presents remarkable neutrophil features in common with
other SCD mouse models such as the βS “BERK” and SS knock-in
sickle strains, with high counts of circulating leukocytes and
neutrophils at steady state and during experimental VOC, thus
mimicking what is observed in humans,19 and exquisite sensitivity
to TNFα-induced leukocyte adhesion.372 One of the advantages of
the SAD strain is its robustness with a fully controlled congenic
C57Bl6/J background and easy breeding thus enabling experiments
without the use of fetal liver or bone marrow transplant. It has also
proven its relevance as a model of vaso-occlusion403820 and of
typical chronic degenerative organ injury.413820 Thus, the SAD
mouse model displays a characteristic inflammatory microvascular
disease. At least at the level of neutrophil adhesion to the
endothelium, our study indicates that this model shares common
pathways relevant to the human condition.
Contrasting with the findings of previous studies, which used
pharmacological blockade or genetic deficiency models4542 to
unravel physiological functions of the ETB receptor, our current
data suggest that neutrophil endothelial recruitment is primarily
dependent upon an unblocked ETB receptor. However, previous
studies used both non-SCD animal models and human subjects at
steady state, in which the primary role of endothelial ETB is to
contribute to ET-1 clearance42 and stimulation of nitric oxide
production which is essential for termination of ET-1 signaling.4645
Our novel findings demonstrate an important contribution of the
ETB receptor to vascular inflammation in SCD.
Here, we provide the first series of systematic investigations aimed
at unravelling the role of ET receptors in the different phases of the
neutrophil-endothelial interaction. They complement earlier work
showing that endothelins are chemoattractants for neutrophils47 in
vitro. The first in vivo studies used perfusion of exogenous ET-1; this
led to a time- and dose-dependent sequential entrapment of
platelets and neutrophils in the pulmonary circulation.48 Similarly,
the multi-step recruitment of rabbit peritoneal neutrophils was
stimulated by ET-1 and inhibited by a specific antagonist of the ETA
receptor.49 These findings were recently confirmed and expanded,
as treatment with a mixed ETA/B receptor antagonist, bosentan, and
selective ETA and ETB receptor antagonists (BQ-123 and BQ-788,


respectively) inhibited ET-1 and ovalbumin-induced neutrophil
migration to the peritoneal cavity, suggesting that ET-1, acting
through both ETA and ETB, is an important mediator of neutrophil
recruitment in adaptive inflammation.50 Further studies will be
needed to explore these chemotactic actions of ET-1.
It is intriguing that ET receptor blockers had a significantly more
potent effect on neutrophil adhesion in sickle SAD mice than in
their WT counterparts. This may be due to a potentially stronger
chemotactic ET-1 concentration gradient emanating from the
pathological endothelium, creating higher ET-1 concentrations in
the SCD circulation. We hypothesize that SCD-specific vascular
inflammation may prime neutrophils and cause increased
neutrophil adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils
to tissues through increased local ET-1 availability from endothelial
cells, neutrophils and, potentially, other, yet to be identified blood
cells. Another complementary hypothesis could be that neutrophils
from SCD individuals may differ in their ability to degrade local
endothelial-derived and autocrine-derived ET-1, as reported for
human neutrophils in vitro.51 Our findings may also foster further
studies to investigate the role of ET-3, a selective ETB agonist that
may be induced in SCD.52
Increased potency of ET receptor blockers on neutrophil adhesion in
SCD conditions may also be related to distinct patterns of ET
receptor expression, although we did not observe this, at least in
human neutrophils. Excess of ligand usually promotes
desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors such as ET receptors,
a counter-regulatory mechanism that may be defective in SCD
neutrophils or endothelial cells. We did not perform any
comparative dose-response studies to evaluate neutrophil sensitivity
to ET-1 in SCD and control subjects. Defective desensitization or
SCD-specific bias in post-receptor signaling could cause increased
ET receptor-dependent cell adhesion. This would be consistent with
the more intense and prolonged adhesion of neutrophils to post-
capillary venules induced by TNFα in sickle mice compared to that
in their WT congenic controls. Thus, the SAD mouse model exhibits
exquisite sensitivity to TNFα, reminiscent of TNF-induced leukocyte
stasis in the cremasteric venules, which was fatal in a high
percentage of mice transplanted with bone marrow from the severe


βS “BERK” mouse model.372 The reason for this magnified
response to TNFα is still unclear. Such induced blood stasis may
trigger VOC in the context of infections, as classically reported in
septic patients.
The current studies set the stage for investigation of the ET system
in neutrophil recruitment in other conditions beyond SCD. Indeed,
early studies suggested a particular role for neutrophil recruitment
in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury5453 a condition that is
particularly relevant to SCD-associated VOC. Conflicting reports
regarding the respective roles of the ETA and ETB receptors suggest
that pathophysiological context matters. Overall, both receptor
subtypes have been shown to be involved in undefined steps of
neutrophil recruitment5655 and our findings further demonstrate
the potent effect of ET receptor antagonists on neutrophil adhesion
and transmigration in SCD with a particular emphasis on the role of
the ETB receptor.
Our results with human neutrophils and cultured endothelial cells
in microfluidic flow chambers indicate that the ETB receptor
promotes neutrophil adhesion through activation at both the
neutrophil and the endothelial cell surface.
In endothelial cells, the exact mechanisms whereby recruitment of
neutrophils is dependent on an unblocked ETB receptor remain to
be clarified. As discussed above, more efficient coupling of the ETB
receptor to adhesion molecules may be at play.
On the other hand, ET-1 was shown to promote neutrophil
aggregation (homotypic adhesion)5735 as well as β2-integrin-
dependent attachment of neutrophils to cultured human and bovine
vascular endothelial cells (heterotypic cell adhesion). We provide
here the first direct evidence of functional ETB receptors coupled to
calcium signaling in neutrophils from control and sickle cell
subjects. Together with our results showing that selective ETB
blockade alleviated adhesion of human neutrophils to adhesion
molecules, this suggests that ETB signaling may trigger calcium-
induced activation of integrins. Interestingly, increased adhesion
has been linked to the higher membrane expression of CD11b/CD18
on neutrophils from SCD patients than on those from controls.13
Furthermore, blocking CD11b/Mac-1 using M1/70 antibody was


sufficient to diminish the erythrocyte–leukocyte interaction
significantly, preventing VOC and prolonging survival in SCD mice
challenged by TNFα and surgical trauma.23 These studies
highlighted the role of CD11b in the pathophysiology of acute VOC
in SCD. It is worth noting that expression of CD18 and CD11b on
the surface of neutrophils was also increased by ET-1 in vitro595853
although it was not investigated which ET receptor was involved. In
line with these results, administration of TNFα induced very
significant upregulation of CD11b expression in neutrophils from
both WT and SAD animals but this effect was markedly asymmetric
with a further 50% increase in the sickle cell condition.
Surprisingly, ET receptor antagonists limited CD11b-associated
mean fluorescence surface intensity and the proportion of
neutrophils with high CD11b expression in neutrophils from
TNFα−challenged SAD animals. Moreover, ETA and ETB
antagonists had no effect on CD11b expression in normal mice. This
suggests that involvement of the ET system in pro-inflammatory
CD11b upregulation and neutrophil adhesion is specific to the SCD
condition. Moreover, the expression of the integrin is probably not
the only regulatory mechanism involved, given that rapid
alterations in β2 integrin conformation, and consequently ligand
affinity,60 could also play a very important role in neutrophil
adhesion.
Surprisingly, and contrary to previous reports, we found no
difference in CD62L expression in neutrophils from sickle mice
compared to normal ones.119 An explanation for this phenomenon
might be that, in vivo, strongly activated neutrophils may have left
the circulation and are therefore underrepresented in the blood
samples used for flow cytometry analysis.
In summary, our current findings suggest that human neutrophils
display functional ETB receptors with calcium signaling capability,
leading to accentuated adhesion to the endothelium. Using our
high-speed imaging platform, we observed that the ETB response
promoted rolling and firm adhesion of neutrophils, resulting in
significant subsequent migration of these cells through venular
walls to tissue, specifically in sickle cell mice. Furthermore, we
confirmed that human neutrophils synthesize ET-1, which may be
involved in autocrine and paracrine pathophysiological actions, and


may contribute to the higher plasma levels of ET-1 reported in SCD
individuals. Thus, the ET-1-ETB axis should be considered as a
cytokine-like potent pro-inflammatory pathway in SCD. If ET
receptor antagonists are proven to be safe and effective in the
prevention or treatment of acute VOC in the clinical setting, they
should include anti-ETB potency. Such antagonists may provide
major clinical benefits, improve quality of life, and prolong survival
of SCD patients.
