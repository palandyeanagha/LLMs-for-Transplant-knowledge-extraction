Abstract
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) continues to have a high mortality. Currently, there are no biomarkers that
provide reliable prognostic information to guide clinical management or stratify risk among clinical trial participants. The
objective of this study was to probe the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) proteome to identify proteins that differentiate
survivors from non-survivors of ARDS. Patients were divided into early-phase (1 to 7 days) and late-phase (8 to 35 days)
groups based on time after initiation of mechanical ventilation for ARDS (Day 1). Isobaric tags for absolute and relative
quantitation (iTRAQ) with LC MS/MS was performed on pooled BALF enriched for medium and low abundance proteins
from early-phase survivors (n = 7), early-phase non-survivors (n = 8), and late-phase survivors (n = 7). Of the 724 proteins
identified at a global false discovery rate of 1%, quantitative information was available for 499. In early-phase ARDS, proteins
more abundant in survivors mapped to ontologies indicating a coordinated compensatory response to injury and stress.
These included coagulation and fibrinolysis; immune system activation; and cation and iron homeostasis. Proteins more
abundant in early-phase non-survivors participate in carbohydrate catabolism and collagen synthesis, with no activation of
compensatory responses. The compensatory immune activation and ion homeostatic response seen in early-phase survivors
transitioned to cell migration and actin filament based processes in late-phase survivors, revealing dynamic changes in the
BALF proteome as the lung heals. Early phase proteins differentiating survivors from non-survivors are candidate biomarkers
for predicting survival in ARDS.

Introduction
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is characterized
by the abrupt onset of tachypnea, hypoxia, and loss of lung
compliance in response to infectious or inflammatory triggers [1].
Extensive research has improved our understanding of ARDS
pathophysiology [2], epidemiology [3,4], treatment options [5–7],
and outcomes [3,8], yet ARDS patients continue to have a high
mortality rate. There is strong interest in identifying biomarkers to
predict the development of ARDS in at-risk subjects [9–11], assist
in diagnosis [12–15], and inform prognosis [13,16–20]. Biomark￾ers enabling risk stratification would not only be useful in the
clinical care setting, but also in clinical trials of new therapeutic
interventions to phenotype clinical trial subjects and serve as
surrogate endpoints.
Development of ARDS is associated with the activation of a
large number of inflammatory mediators that damage the alveolar
epithelium, endothelium, and basement membrane. Biomarkers
based on the tissue of origin have been studied in both single
center studies [11,21,22] and in NHLBI ARDS network cohorts
[13,16,21]. Most studies have focused on investigating an
individual biomarker in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF), or urine. Markers of inflammation such as interleukin￾1b [23], interleukin 6 [7], and soluble TNF receptor I and II [24]
are associated with poor prognosis in ARDS. Markers of
endothelial damage including ICAM-1 [7,21], Angiopoeitin
(Ang) [13], and Von Willibrand Factor (vWF) [25] correlate with
higher mortality from ARDS. Poorer outcomes are also associated
with higher plasma levels of SP-D (but not SP-A), a marker of type
2 alveolar epithelial cell damage [19], and receptor of advance
glycation end products (RAGE), a marker of type 1 alveolar
epithelial cell damage. Several other molecules, such as those
involved in coagulation [26], damage to extracellular matrix [20],
and oxidative stress (urine NO) [20], correlate with ARDS
outcomes. A combination of biomarkers and clinical predictors
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e109713

was found to be superior to clinical predictors or biomarkers alone
for predicting mortality in ARDS [27]. However, the identification
of a single biomarker or a combination of biomarkers that could be
widely used has remained elusive [28] due to lack of correlation
between the biochemical marker, pathophysiological variables and
clinical outcomes.
The primary aim of this study was to identify pathways of
survival and stimulate new biomarker discovery by characterizing
the BALF protein expression profile of ARDS survivors and non￾survivors at different stages (early versus late) of disease progres￾sion. We analyzed medium and low abundant protein fractions in
BALF samples by using contemporary high-resolution mass
spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics techniques, along with
quantitative labeling methodology. Our hypothesis was that
patients who are able to survive ARDS would exhibit a distinct
BALF protein profile during the early phase of mechanical
ventilator support. Here, we show distinct differences in the BALF
proteome between patients who survive ARDS from those who
die. Moreover, the ontologies of differentially expressed proteins in
late-phase survivors (cell migration and actin cytoskeleton orga￾nization) differ markedly from those in early-phase survivors,
suggesting a critical role for these processes during lung repair.
Enhancing these processes may provide new directions for therapy
in ARDS.
Methods
Study population
The University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board
Human Subjects Committee approved this study. Patients were
recruited at the University of Minnesota Medical Center.
Informed consent for study participation was obtained from either
the patient or the patient’s legal representative. The early-phase
ARDS BALF samples were available from clinically indicated
bronchoscopies with excess supernatant made available for these
studies. The late-phase ARDS samples were excess supernatant
BALF obtained from research bronchoscopies with consent from
the patient or the surrogate. BAL (100 mls normal saline) was
performed using standard protocol in either the right middle lobe
or left upper lobe (lingual)
For this study, patients were grouped based on the timing of the
bronchoscopy – conducted in either the early phase of ARDS (Day
1–7) or the late phase (Day 8–35), referenced to the initiation of
mechanical ventilation (designated Day 1) – and the outcome at
the time of discharge (non-survivor or survivor). We thus studied
patients in the early phase who were grouped into survivors or
non-survivors and late-phase survivors. Late phase non-survivors
were not included in this study as not enough BALF was available
to perform the protein expression profile. The APAHCHEE-II
score was calculated to assess the severity of illness on the day of
bronchoscopy for patients in early phase of ARDS as previously
described [29].
Sample preparation
BALF samples were processed as previously described [30] with
some modifications. BALF containing equal amounts of protein
from individual patients were pooled to collect a total of 4 mg
protein for each group (early-phase survivors, early-phase non￾survivors, and late-phase survivors). Pooled BALF was concen￾trated and desalted by centrifugation with an Amicon 3-MWCO
spin filter (Millipore, catalog number UFC800396). To decrease
the dynamic range, we enriched the medium and low abundance
proteins by selectively immunodepleting the fourteen most
abundant proteins in the concentrated samples on Seppro IgY
14 spin columns (Sigma-Aldrich, cat # SEP010). The Seppro IgY
14 spin columns deplete albumin, IgG, a1-antitrypsin, IgA, IgM,
transferrin, haptoglobin, a2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, comple￾ment C3, a1-acid glycoprotein, aplopoproteins A-1, A-II and B.
Per the manufacturer’s instructions, each sample was mixed in the
dilution buffer to a final volume of 500 ml, loaded onto the
immunoaffinity depletion column, and incubated for 15 minutes at
room temperature. To prevent saturation of the column, 250 mg of
protein was depleted at a time. The unbound medium and low
abundance proteins were collected in the flow through. Pooled
samples from each representative group was required to have
adequate protein concentrations since immunodepletion results in
.90% of the proteins being removed. An additional wash was
performed with 0.5 ml of the dilution buffer. The depleted
samples were then concentrated with an Amicon filter. A buffer
exchange with 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) was
performed to remove TRIS, and the sample was concentrated
with an Amicon filter. A Bradford protein assay was performed to
quantify the enriched low abundant proteins.
iTRAQ labeling and 2D LC-Orbitrap MS
Enriched medium and low abundance proteins (50 mg from
early-phase survivors and non-survivors, 25 mg from late phase
survivors) were digested by trypsin and labeled with iTRAQ
reagent (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) [30] for mass spectrometric
analysis. The total peptide mixture was purified with an MCX
Oasis cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) before separation via two￾dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (2D LC￾MS). LC and MS experimental details were previously reported
[30]. Proteins were separated and concentrated offline in the 1st
dimension into 15 peptide-containing fractions, collected in 2-
minute intervals on a C18 Gemini column (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA) at pH 10, and in the 2nd dimension by a C18
reversed phase capillary LC with a nano LC system (Eksigent,
Dublin, CA). Data-dependent acquisition of the 6 most intense
peaks per LC fraction was performed on an Orbitrap Velos
system, with HCD (higher energy collision induced dissociation) as
the activation type for peptide tandem MS.
Database search for protein identification and
quantification
Each of the 15.RAW files generated from the Orbitrap Velos
MS system were converted to mzML files by using msconvert,
then converted to a ProteinPilot compatible Mascot Generic
Format (MGF) with preselected iTRAQ reporter ions. The MGF
files were searched against the Human UniProt database along
with contaminant protein sequences (84,838 sequences in total;
December 2012) using ProteinPilot version 4.5 and the following
search parameters: Sample Type: iTRAQ 4-plex (peptide labeled);
Cys-alkylation: MMTS; Instrument: Orbi MS, Orbi MS/MS;
Run Quant; Use bias correction; Search focus on biological
modifications and amino-acid substitutions; Thorough search and
with a Detected Protein Threshold (Unused Protscore (Conf)):
10%. The ProteinPilot searches and subsequent generation of
PSPEP (FDR) reports and protein and peptide-level summaries
were generated within Galaxy-P [31]. Because MS data acquisi￾tion was performed on BALF samples after depletion of 14 high
abundance plasma proteins, the high abundance proteins (or their
fragment) were manually removed if they were present in the list of
inferred proteins generated by ProteinPilot. Protein Summary with
iTRAQ ratios (with early-phase survivors as the denominator for
determining fold change) was processed through a workflow built
within Galaxy-P so that it yielded UniProt accession numbers and
gene names of differentially expressed proteins. The mass

with the dataset identifier PXD001095.
Statistical analysis
Differences in the clinical characteristics of the three participant
groups were calculated by using ANOVA and, when appropriate,
a post hoc Tukey test. For protein identification and quantifica￾tion, multiple hypothesis correction was performed by controlling
for false discovery rate (FDR), which measures the expected
proportion of false positives among the statistically significant
findings. The FDR cutoff was set at #1% (global) for protein
identification in ProteinPilot. For quantification of protein
abundance, each ratio (obtained by comparison of early-phase
non-survivors to survivors or late-phase survivors to early- phase
survivors) was compared to one; multiple hypothesis correction
was performed by controlling the FDR set at #5% [33] and
computing q-values with the mafdr routine in Matlab. Proteins
with q-values less than 0.05 were retained for further analysis.
Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis
To gain insight into the biological significance of differentially
expressed proteins, we used the Database for Annotation,
Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://david.
abcc.ncifcrf.gov, search date 7/11/13) [34]. DAVID provides
batch annotations to highlight the most relevant GO term
associated with a gene (or protein) list. Of the three GO terms

differentially expressed proteins. Functional annotation clustering
analysis in DAVID was used to identify the combinations of genes
according to common biological function. DAVID generates an
enrichment score for a group of genes indicating annotation term
member associations in a given experiment. An enrichment score
of 1.3 is equivalent to a non-log scale p-value of 0.05.

Results
Characteristics of study participants
We analyzed BALF samples from 22 unique ARDS patients
(Table 1 and Table 2): 7 in the early-phase survivor group (mean
ARDS day of sample collection = 2.061.15 days), 8 in the early
phase non-survivor group (mean ARDS day of sample collection
= 3.2562.19 days), and 7 in the late-phase survivor group (mean
ARDS day of sample collection = 18.6613.3 days). Although the
mean age of patients in the early-phase non-survivor group was
higher than in the other two groups, this difference was not
statistically significant (ANOVA p-value = 0.16). The three groups
did not differ in the severity of gas exchange on the day of the
bronchoscopy, APACHEE-II score, BALF leukocyte count, or
BALF neutrophil count. The average time from onset of ARDS to
death in the early phase non-survivor group was 19.9614.5 days.
Proteins identified by peptide spectral matching and
database searching
The ProteinPilot PSPEP FDR Summary reported 20,601
spectra matched to 10,355 distinct peptides at #1% global FDR
for a total of 792 inferred proteins (Table S1, Protein Pilot PSPEP
summary and protein identified at 1% FDR tab). High abundance
proteins or their fragments (Table S1, High abundance/contam￾inants tab) that were incompletely removed by the depletion
column were removed manually from the protein list. Suspected
contaminants or misidentified proteins such as trypsin, bovine
albumin, and the reverse matches that occurred from use of the
target decoy strategy for peptide identification were also manually
removed. After exclusion of these proteins, the number of inferred
proteins was 724 (Table S1, BALF proteome tab). These724
proteins were used as the background for GO enrichment analysis
(i.e. the ‘‘universe of identified BALF proteome’’). Of these 724
proteins, quantitative spectral data were available on 499 to allow
determination of the bias corrected relative abundance in the two
comparison groups for this study (Table S1, BALF with
quantification tab). All but three proteins had at least two peptides
used for identification. Bias factors for the two comparison groups
were 2.8 for the early phase non-survivors to survivors and 0.64 for
early phase survivor to late phase survivor group. Bias factors were
used for normalization of the protein quantification within
ProteinPilot.
Proteins differentiating early-phase survivors and early￾phase non-survivors
Controlling for an FDR of #5%, we identified 161 proteins that
were differentially expressed in the BALF of early-phase survivors
compared with early-phase non-survivors (Table S2, proteins with
q-values #5%). Eighty-six of these proteins were more abundant
in non-survivors (Table S2, high in non-survivors tab) and 75 were
more abundant in survivors (Table S2, high in survivors tab). Gene
ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated significant differences
in the biological processes represented by these differentially
expressed proteins (Figure 1). The differentially expressed proteins
represented six ontologies in survivors (Table 3): three involved in
coagulation (fibrinolysis and coagulation and wound healing), two
representing cellular ion homeostasis, and one involved in immune
activation. In contrast, differentially expressed proteins mapped to
three ontologies in non-survivors (Table 4, Table S2, GO non￾survivors tab). Non-survivors showed disruption of bioenergetics
with evidence of carbohydrate catabolism and cellular damage as
evidenced by disorganization of actin filament based processes. In
addition, there was evidence of collagen biosynthesis in non￾survivors early in ARDS.
Changes in the proteome among late-phase survivors
We identified 172 proteins (FDR at #5%) that demonstrated
differential expression between early-phase and late-phase survi￾Figure 1. Biological processes represented by 165 proteins that are differentially expressed when early-phase non-survivors are

In the functional annotation-clustering tool, an enrichment score of 1.3 that corresponds to a non-log scale p-value of 0.05 was used as the cutoff for
significance.

vors of ARDS (Table S3, FDR q-values tab). Of these 172
proteins, 91 were more abundant in early-phase ARDS survivors
(Table S3, high in early phase tab) and 81 were more abundant in
late-phase ARDS survivors (Table S3, high in late phase tab).
Gene ontology enrichment analysis employing the functional
annotation-clustering tool in DAVID identified three ontology
annotations that were over represented in early-phase survivors:
lymphocyte and leukocyte immune response, cellular cation
homeostasis, and iron ion homeostasis (Table S3, GO early phase
tab). In contrast, proteins that were more abundant in late-phase
survivors represented two clusters of ontologies involved in lung
repair: cell migration and actin cytoskeleton organization
(Figure 2 and Table S2, GO late phase tab).
Changes in key proteins concentrations in individual
samples
As we used pooled samples for our proteomic studies, we
measured protein concentration from individual BALF samples by
ELISA. Similar to the MS data, the level of club cell secretory
protein was significantly higher in early phase non-survivors when
compared to early phase survivors (245861409 vs. 9226534 ng/
mL, p-value = 0.048, figure 3a). Moesin (1.0260.52 vs.
2.6361.76 ng/ml, p-value 0.055, Figure 3b) and MMP 9
(93.516133.1 vs. 10611.87 ng/mL, p-value = 0.19, figure 3c)
demonstrated a non-significant increase in early phase non￾survivors compared to survivors. Although MUC5A was higher in
survivors, it did not reach statistical significance (10.74614.16 vs.
4.49963.48, p-value = 0.29 whereas SP-D was not different.
To develop a panel of candidate proteins that could discrim￾inate early phase survivors from non-survivors, we measured
BALF levels of several key proteins that were higher in survivors

and participated in biological processes listed in Table 3. BALF
levels of Plasminogen, Factor 12, Antithrombin and Cerulopasmin
were consistent with our iTRAQ MS/MS findings (Figure 4).
However, BALF levels of kininogen and Prothrombin (Factor 2)
did not mirror the quantitative iTRAQ MS/MS data. We also
measured levels of key proteins that participated in biological
processes in early phase non-survivors listed in Table 4. S100A9
and Thioredoxin levels measured by ELISA mirrored the iTRAQ
data (figure 5). Similar to the iTRAQ MS data, Ezrin level
measured by ELISA in pooled BA was higher in non-survivors
compared to survivors (2.45 ng/ml vs. 0.737 ng/ml.) We were not
able to detect decay accelerating factor and CD9 by ELISA in our

Discussion
In this study we achieved deep coverage of the BALF proteome
through the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry based
proteomics and an optimized sample preparation designed to
enrich medium and low abundance protein fractions. This extent
of proteome coverage has not been previously reported in human
BALF from normal or diseased lungs [35–40]. The semi￾quantitative techniques used in this study reveal dynamic changes
in the distal airspace of patients with ARDS. Differences in the
BALF protein expression profile are seen early in the course of
ARDS in patients who die compared with those who live. Further,
GO enrichment analysis demonstrates highly informative, biolog￾ically coherent differences in the ontologies represented by the
differentially expressed proteins when early-phase survivors are
compared to late-phase survivors or early-phase non-survivors.
The BALF protein expression profile for patients early in ARDS
was different comparing survivors to non-survivors. Patients who
died had evidence of aberrant lung repair early on in the disease
process, as evidenced by approximately a two-fold differential
expression of type I, III and V collagen, a signature of activated
fibroblasts, and newly synthesized collagen deposition. This is in
line with previous reports that higher levels of collagen I and III in
ARDS [41] reflect matrix remodeling locally in the lung.
Increased levels of BALF type III procollagen also correlated with
fatal outcomes in ARDS [42]. In contrast, survivors early in the
disease course demonstrated a more coordinated response that
includes coagulation as the focal point, including plasminogen￾mediated fibrinolysis. The balance of activation of coagulation and
fibrinolysis is an important determination of the extent of fibrin
deposition. In previous studies, tissue factor mediated pro￾coagulant [43], protein C mediated anti-coagulant [44], and
plasminogen mediated fibrinolysis pathways appeared to be
important in ARDS [45]. Up-regulation of plasminogen activator
inhibitor in BALF suggests a shift from a pro-fibrinolytic to an
anti-fibrinolytic phenotype being associated with poorer outcomes
[46]. In our study, a similar pattern of active collagen deposition
suggesting an anti-fibrinolytic milieu even in the exudative phase
in ARDS non-survivors is seen, while ARDS survivors have a
more prominent fibrinolytic milieu. This indicates a profound
difference in response to alveolar injury in survivors compared to
non-survivors.
In addition to abnormal repair, non-survivors also have
evidence of increased catabolism and cellular disruptions. In
contrast, survivors demonstrate a coordinated activation of cation
and iron homeostasis. Prior studies have shown the importance of
iron in the development of ARDS [47,48]. Cell and tissue damage
resulting from inflammatory/oxidative stress can ultimately be a
consequence of disruption of normal iron metabolism. Patients
with ARDS have increased concentrations of heme and non-heme
iron that could lead to generation of oxidative stress and resultant
lung damage [49]. Polymorphisms in ferritin light chain and
heme-oxygenase have also been associated with increased
susceptibility to ARDS [50]. In survivors, higher levels of several
proteins involved in iron regulation such as ferritin heavy and light
chain, hemopexin, and cerruloplasmin indicate better capacity to
counteract the redox stress mediated by iron or other reactive
oxygen species in the lungs.
In addition to giving insight into mechanisms of disease,
differentially expressed proteins in the early phase of ARDS can be
used to discern non-survivors from survivors for prognostication.
The ideal biomarker would have biological significance related to
lung injury and repair. Alternatively, a panel of proteins that
represent the divergent biological processes in the two groups

could be selected for testing in a separate cohort of well
phenotyped patients. As the proteomic platform that we used
only provides relative quantitation, complementary studies using
multiplex ELISA or multiple reaction monitoring will be needed to
measure absolute levels to select a limited number of proteins that
could be further investigated. We used ELISA for measurement of
protein levels for two main reasons. First, this provided validation
that mass spectrometric measures of the protein amounts were

accurate. The fold change for CCSP (sp|P11684|UTER_HU￾MAN, Table S2, high in non-survivor tab, row 25) was 6.2 fold in
the mass spectrometric studies. In line with these findings, the
mean levels measured with ELISA demonstrated a .4.5 fold
higher abundance in the protein level. Similarly, other proteins
produced in the lung, Moesin, MMP9 and MUC5A, also
demonstrated a trend toward higher levels in non-survivors by
ELISA and mass spectrometry studies, whereas surfactant D did
not demonstrate a significant change when measured in individual
BALF samples. These proteins could represent epithelial damage
and be candidate proteins to test in a larger cohort of well
phenotyped subjects with ARDS.
CCSP is produced by small airway cells and has been
implicated in regulating inflammatory responses in the lung. In
patients with ventilator associated pneumonia, serum CCSP levels
increased 2 days before the diagnosis of ARDS/ALI [51].
However, data regarding the utility of plasma CCSP levels is
conflicting in small studies with one study demonstrating evidence
in CCSP predicting mortality [52], while another study did not
find any association of serum CCSP levels with mortality [53].
Our study suggests BALF CCSP levels alone or conjunction with
other proteins could be marker of epithelial damage and could
predict mortality in ARDS.
ERM (ezirin-radixin-moesin) proteins co-localize in cell matrix
adhesion sites, filopodia, and membrane protrusions [54]. ERMs
function by binding to and organizing the actin cytoskeleton [55]
and in turn, stabilizing adherens junctions [56] and influencing cell
migration [57,58]. In adult wild-type mice, moesin expression is
limited to the alveolar epithelium of the distal lung. Moesin￾deficient mice develop normally [59] demonstrate decreased
moesin in the distal alveolar wall and have airspace enlargement.
In response to bleomycin, moesin- deficient mice had lower
survival [60], more inflammation, extensive alveolar destruction,
hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, increased lung permeability,
and a higher total BALF cell count. In moesin-deficient mice,
fibrotic response to bleomycin was both earlier and more severe.
This supports involvement of moesin in injury-repair response in
the lung.
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are proteases that are involved
degradation of extracellular matrix. Type IV collagen is specific to
the basement membrane and MMP-9 is a type IV collagenase. In
ARDS, BALF MMP-9 levels were high compared to controls and
correlated with degree of collagen breakdown as determined by
measuring collagen breakdown products (7S collagen) [61]. Early
elevations of MMP-9 levels have also been found to be associated
with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation in pediatric
ARDS patients [62]. In our study, although we did not compare
the BALF MMP-9 level in ARDS with controls, higher BALF
MMP-9 were seen in patients who died. Though speculative, this
could be a marker of worse epithelial damage in non-survivors. In
addition we also measured MUC5A levels in the BALF by ELISA.
MUC5A is a member of the mucins, large glycoproteins that form
a protective biofilm covering the respiratory epithelial lining.
MUC5AC is secreted mostly by the surface epithelial goblet cells
[63]. MUC5AC transcript levels increase in airway epithelial cells
upon cyclic stretch, in mice with ventilator induced lung injury
and in humans with ARDS [63]. Though the proteins levels of
MUC5AC in our studies did not differentiate survivors and non￾survivors, this may have resulted from our relatively small sample.
In this study we also compared the BALF protein expression
profiles of early- and late- phase survivors. This comparison
highlights the dynamic changes in the airspace milieu during
repair. Chang and colleagues [36] characterized BALF in ARDS
patients on day 1, 3, and 7; their results demonstrated striking
differences between normal controls and ARDS patients on day 1,
but less dramatic changes between days 1, 3 and 7. The changes
seen in their studies reflected alteration in the innate immune and
oxidant pathways at day 3 and possibly lung regeneration at day 7.
Similar to that study, we found that activation of the innate
immune system and cation homeostasis were over-represented by
proteins in early-phase survivors compared to late-phase survivors.
However, in our late-phase survivors – whose samples were
obtained 18 days after the onset of ARDS, much later than in
previous studies – the ontologies were drastically different and
included cell migration and actin cytoskeleton organization. Since
all of these patients survived, these findings suggest a critical role of
these processes during lung repair. The proteins that are
represented in these ontologies could be potential targets to
stimulate repair mechanisms as potential molecular targets for
therapy in ARDS.
We acknowledge the limitations of our study. We were limited
by the amount of available BALF therefore are the protein
characterization was performed on pooled BALF samples. Pooled
samples are subject to influence by a minority of outliers within the
pool. We were limited to a single run for the mass-spectrometry.
However, we demonstrate changes in protein levels using ELISA
studies that were performed on individual subject samples.
Another limitation is the study design, i.e. binary outcome that
can be influenced by a number of confounders not controlled in
our study. Our approach was to enrich the medium and low
abundance protein fractions by depleting high abundance
proteins. We chose depletion over alternative method to avoid
an unwieldy dynamic range with a subsequent limited depth of
proteome coverage. In addition, many of the abundant proteins
that were eliminated are found in the plasma, which can leak into
the alveolar space during lung injury. Another limitation is our
relatively small number of subjects. Despite the small sample size,
our sample preparation optimization methods enabled us to
successfully identify a number of differentially expressed proteins.
Our findings provide a starting point for subsequent studies
characterizing BALF in individual patients for biomarker identi￾fication in ARDS.
Conclusion
This study illustrates a framework whereby protein profiling can
be used to identify panels of proteins that parallel the pathophys￾iological changes occurring in ARDS. We demonstrate dynamic
changes in BALF protein expression during the course of ARDS
and also early divergence in the protein expression profile in
ARDS. Differences in absolute levels of the proteins that represent
divergent biological processes in survivors and non-survivors will
facilitate identification of prognostic biomarkers in ARDS.
