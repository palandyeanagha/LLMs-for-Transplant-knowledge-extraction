Abstract
Background: Partial nephrectomy has been increasingly recommended over radical nephrectomy for the
management of small renal masses based on improved renal functional outcomes without sacrifice of oncologic
effectiveness. Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) has been introduced in an effort to offer another minimally
invasive option for nephron-sparing surgery. However, reports of RAPN have been limited to short-term perioperative
outcomes. The goal of this study is to report and evaluate the initial oncologic outcomes of RAPN. Utilizing
prospectively obtained data on RAPN performed by four surgeons at four separate tertiary care centers, we selected
patients with unilateral, localized, non-familial, pathologically-confirmed pT1 renal cell carcinoma and a minimum post￾operative follow-up of 12 months.
Methods: Utilizing prospectively obtained data on RAPN performed by four surgeons at four separate tertiary care
centers, we selected patients with unilateral, localized, non-familial, pathologically-confirmed pT1 renal cell carcinoma
and a minimum post-operative follow-up of 12 months. Survival analysis (disease-free, cancer-specific, and overall
survival) was performed, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated.
Results: RAPN was performed in 124 patients with a median tumor size of 3.0 cm (IQR 2.2-4.2 cm). Median follow-up
was 29 months (range 12-46 months). Positive parenchymal surgical margins occurred in two patients (1.6 %), both of
whom were recurrence-free at 30 and 34 months after surgery. The three-year Kaplan-Meier estimated disease-free
survival was 94.9 %, cancer-specific survival was 99.1 %, and overall survival was 97.3 %.
Conclusions: In our cohort of patients with small renal carcinomas who were followed for a median of 29 months,
recurrence and survival outcomes were similar to those reported for open and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Further
long-term outcomes will be needed to definitively claim that RAPN is oncologically equivalent to other surgical
approaches.

Background
The incidence of small renal neoplasia is increasing, likely
secondary to the increasing use of cross-sectional imaging
[1]. Although, traditionally, radical nephrectomy has been
performed for the definitive treatment of suspected small
renal cell cancers, partial nephrectomy has become increas￾ingly popular as a nephron-sparing option [2]. The Ameri￾can Urological Association’s guidelines for management of
the clinical T1 renal mass place partial nephrectomy as a
standard treatment option [3].
Partial nephrectomy may be accomplished via a variety of
techniques. Open partial nephrectomy (OPN) has been
shown to have excellent long-term oncologic outcomes
which are similar to radical nephrectomy [4,5]. Laparoscopic
partial nephrectomy (LPN) was developed as a minimally in￾vasive alternative to open partial nephrectomy, and studies
have also shown cancer control comparable to OPN [6,7].
More recently, robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN)
has been developed as another option for the excision of a
small renal mass. Preliminary studies have shown an accept￾able learning curve with feasible results [8–11]. Complica￾tions of the RAPN approach are appropriate (15.8% overall
complication rate) [12], as are initial perioperative patho￾logical outcomes (positive margin rate of 1.6% - 4.1%) [8,13–
15]. We previously reported multi-institutional analyses of
perioperative and functional outcomes of RAPN- including
complication rates, blood loss, warm ischemia time, post-op￾erative changes in glomerular filtration rate, and hospital
stay- and demonstrated favorable outcomes in all of these
parameters [8,15].
Despite the favorable perioperative results of RAPN, there
are no current studies focused on survival outcomes of this
newer procedure. Nascent procedures should undergo ana￾lysis and reporting of oncologic outcomes to ensure that
survival curves are not inferior to those of established
procedures. Previous reports of OPN and LPN show dis￾ease-free survival (DFS) rates of 83% - 98%, cancer-specific
survival (CSS) rates of 82% - 99%, and overall survival (OS)
rates of 72% - 96%, respectively [4–6,16–20]. A formal as￾sessment of oncologic outcomes of RAPN is absolutely ne￾cessary to demonstrate comparative efficacy of the robotic
approach. Therefore, the primary goal of this multi-center
study is to examine the intermediate-term oncologic out￾comes of pT1 renal cell cancers which have been treated
with RAPN. The goal will be to assess an “oncologic check￾point” to ensure that the outcomes of this procedure are not
oncologically inferior to the excellent outcomes that have
been reported with LPN and OPN.
Results
Demographic and clinical data from the study group
(n = 124) are presented in Table 1. Median patient age was
58 years, and median age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity
Index was 1. Table 2 demonstrates the pathological charac￾teristics of the tumors and data on cancer outcomes. Median
tumor size was 3.0 cm, and 107 (86.3%) were staged pT1a,
with the remaining 17 (13.7%) staged as pT1b. Twelve
(9.7%) tumors were classified as Fuhrman grade I, 65 (52.4%)
as Fuhrman grade II, 30 (24.2%) as Fuhrman grade III, and
one (0.8%) as Fuhrman grade IV; grade was not reported in
16 patients. The predominant RCC subtype was clear cell

(66.9%), with a smaller proportion of papillary (21.0 %) and
chromophobe (9.7%) subtypes. Positive parenchymal mar￾gins occurred in two cases (1.6%); both of these patients had
pT1a RCC and were free of recurrence at 30 and 34 months
of follow-up.
Median follow-up was 29.0 months (IQR 25.1-34.0 months,
total range 12-46 months). Two patients (1.6%) had recur￾rence of renal cell cancer at 16 and 35 months post-RAPN
(details described below). One of the recurrences was in the
ipsilateral kidney, and the other had widespread intraperito￾neal metastases. Both patients with recurrence had negative
surgical margins on their original RAPN specimens.
The one ipsilateral recurrence occurred in a patient with
pT1a, Fuhrman grade II clear RCC. A completely endophytic
1.7 cm hypervascular renal lesion developed 35 months after
RPN; this recurrence was treated with percutaneous cryoa￾blation. No diagnostic biopsy of the recurrence was obtained,
but this event is coded as a recurrence for the purposes of
this communication. The second recurrence was a presumed
metastatic renal cell cancer. This patient originally had a
2.7 cm pT1a, Fuhrman grade II papillary RCC excised with
negative margins. The patient developed metastases (nodal,
solid organ, and omental studding) 16 months after RAPN.
Tissue diagnosis of the metastases was not definitive, but
renal cell cancer was the only confirmed malignancy in this
patient. This patient expired seven months after metastasis
development (23 months after the original RAPN) and is
coded as a cancer-specific mortality for this study, although
an alternative secondary malignancy cannot be ruled out.
There was no evidence of tumor spillage, seeding, or known
divergence from oncologic standards during the patient’s
original RAPN procedure, and explanation of the patho￾physiology of this recurrence is not possible.
Death from other non-cancer causes occurred in three indi￾viduals. One patient experienced a cardiovascular-related
morbidity 24 months after surgery. A second patient expired
from metastatic breast cancer 43 months after RAPN. The
last morbidity was a death from an unknown cause 22 months
after surgery; however, this patient was disease-free on im￾aging performed prior to expiration.
Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for 124 patients with
pT1 RCC. The three-year Kaplan-Meier estimated disease￾free survival [Figure 1] rate was 94.9% (95% CI: 86.5% -
100%). The three-year cancer-specific survival [Figure 2]
was estimated at 99.1% (95% CI: 97.3 - 100%), and the over￾all survival rate was estimated at 97.3% (95% CI: 94.3% -
100%) [Figure 3].
Discussion
Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) has emerged as a stand￾ard of care for treating localized renal malignancy [3].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that NSS is a safe
and effective alternative to radical nephrectomy for
patients with small renal tumors, and the use of NSS has
been associated with improved renal functional out￾comes and significant decreases in cardiovascular disease
and overall mortality [21,22].
Open partial nephrectomy is a well-established proced￾ure with studies showing similar oncologic outcomes to
radical nephrectomy. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy
has also been studied with similarly satisfactory oncologic
outcomes. Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy has not

been studied with regards to intermediate-term survival
outcomes, as the procedure was first reported in 2004 and
did not appear in increasing numbers in the literature
until 2008 [23]. As such, the existing literature on RAPN
has focused on feasibility, perioperative outcomes, and
surgical margin status. As with all new oncologic proce￾dures, it is critical to report early outcomes to ensure that
survival curves are appropriate relative to established
procedures. In this multi-center study with a median fol￾low-up of 2.5 years and a maximum follow-up of nearly
four years, we report intermediate-term oncologic out￾comes similar to those that have been previously pub￾lished for LPN and OPN.
Table 3 outlines survival outcomes of OPN and LPN from
several recent studies reported in the literature. The three￾year DFS herein for pT1 (a and b) lesions (94.9%) is similar

to those previously reported for OPN and LPN (84% -
97.6%). Other papers have not reported DFS, but instead
documented metastasis-free survival at 83% – 98%. RAPN
in this study shows a three-year Kaplan-Meier estimated
CSS of 99.1% at a median follow-up of 29months. This
compares to other studies of OPN and LPN, which have
reported CSS at three years or greater of 82 % - 99% and
93% - 99.3%, respectively. Additionally, the three-year OS
herein (97.3%) is comparable to those demonstrated in the
literature for OPN and LPN (Table 3).
The patterns of recurrence are not known yet for robotic
partial nephrectomy. For open partial nephrectomy, the
most common sites of metastasis include lymph nodes,
lungs, contralateral kidney, bone, brain, and liver. In this
series, there was one case of peritoneal implantation, but
without pathological confirmation that this was renal cell, it
is hard to make any firm conclusions. Nevertheless, we have
included it as a cancer related mortality for the purposes of
reporting. It will be interesting to monitor sites of recur￾rence in the future.
Thus, the RAPN results reported here appear to be gener￾ally comparable to those previously documented for OPN
and LPN. Longer term follow-up will be necessary to ensure
no divergence from the standards set by OPN and LPN. It
is critical to note that a detailed statistical comparison of
outcomes between series is not possible secondary to differ￾ences among studies in follow-up, pathology, tumor grades,
RCC subtypes, and reported data. Additionally, since the
majority of cases are less than 4 cm in this study, perhaps
even active surveillance would have resulted in similar out￾comes. Again, long term studies are needed.
Despite these reasonable outcomes, caution is advised in
interpreting the results of this study. As the outcomes are
still at less than four-year follow-up, broad conclusions
cannot be made regarding long-term oncologic outcomes.
Moreover, studies have shown that the risk of RCC recur￾rence is highest between three and five years post-surgery
[24,25]. Thus, more follow-up will be necessary to further
evaluate the long-term oncologic outcomes of RAPN. Sec￾ondly, the surgeons herein are all high-volume robotic
renal surgeons practicing in tertiary-care academic medical
centers, and the generalization of these results to lower
volume surgeons is unknown. Prior reports have identified
improved outcomes comparing high-volume to low-vol￾ume surgeons in some procedures [26,27]. Nevertheless,
this same argument can be applied to most of the OPN
and LPN outcomes literature. Another concern is that this
study is a retrospective review of prospectively maintained
databases, so there are likely inherent unrecognized selec￾tion biases that would not exist in a randomized study.
Lastly, it is important for surgeons to consider that onco￾logic outcomes are only one factor in choosing a treatment
modality; other issues such as complications, ease of per￾formance, patient acceptance, and cost are important
issues which can influence treatment decisions. There cer￾tainly is no detectable superiority of RAPN from a cancer
control perspective. Nevertheless, RAPN appears to have
appropriate survival outcomes in this study. Longer term
follow-up is needed to ensure no divergence in survival
from established standards. Additionally, caution is advised
in the interpretation of any survival analysis, since a recent
randomized study showed a slightly lower overall survival

with partial nephrectomy compared to radical nephrec￾tomy [28].
Conclusions
This study adds to the literature by establishing the first multi￾center evaluation of oncologic outcomes following RAPN. In
patients with localized renal cell cancer measuring less than
4 cm (and perhaps 7 cm, but overall numbers are low), RAPN
was found to have a low rate of positive surgical margins and
disease-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival rates similar
to those previously reported for other surgical approaches. Al￾though this “oncologic checkpoint” for RAPN is promising on
a preliminary basis, further follow-up will be needed to critic￾ally assess the long-term oncologic outcomes of RAPN.
Methods
Prospective data were collected from databases approved by
institutional review boards (IRB), and separate IRB approval
was obtained for pooling the data for a multi-center study.
Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected pro￾spectively on patients who underwent RAPN at four tertiary￾care U.S. academic urological centers from June 2006 to June
2009. All patients who underwent RAPN for a pathologically
confirmed pT1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a minimum
follow-up of 12 months were included. Patients with bilateral
synchronous tumors, known familial cancer syndrome, or
known metastatic disease were excluded. Hence, the study co￾hort was limited to small (<7 cm), sporadic, organ-confined
RCC. Comorbid conditions were assessed with the American
Association of Anesthesiologists Score (ASA) and the age￾adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index [29].
RAPN was performed using previously published techni￾ques [30–32]. The oncologic follow-up protocol consisted of
physical examination and cross-sectional imaging of the chest
and abdomen at three to six months postoperatively and an￾nually thereafter to rule out recurrence. Additional imaging
was left to the discretion of the primary urologist or primary
care physician. Survival outcomes were evaluated using
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Statistical analysis was com￾pleted using SPSSW 15, Medcalc 11.4, and Microsoft Excel
2007.
