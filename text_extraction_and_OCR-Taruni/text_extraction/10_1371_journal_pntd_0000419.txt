Abstract
Background: This report describes a real-time PCR (Q-PCR) strategy to quantify Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) DNA in
peripheral blood samples from Chagas disease patients targeted to conserved motifs within the repetitive satellite
sequence.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The Q-PCR has a detection limit of 0.1 and 0.01 parasites/mL, with a dynamic range of 106
and 107 for Silvio X10 cl1 (T. cruzi I) and Cl Brener stocks (T. cruzi IIe), respectively, an efficiency of 99%, and a coefficient of
determination (R2
) of 0.998. In order to express accurately the parasitic loads: (1) we adapted a commercial kit based on
silica-membrane technology to enable efficient processing of Guanidine Hydrochloride-EDTA treated blood samples and
minimize PCR inhibition; (2) results were normalized incorporating a linearized plasmid as an internal standard of the whole
procedure; and (3) a correction factor according to the representativity of satellite sequences in each parasite lineage group
was determined using a modified real-time PCR protocol (Lg-PCR). The Q-PCR strategy was applied (1) to estimate basal
parasite loads in 43 pediatric Chagas disease patients, (2) to follow-up 38 of them receiving treatment with benznidazole,
and (3) to monitor three chronic Chagas heart disease patients who underwent heart-transplantation and displayed events
of clinical reactivation due to immunosupression.
Conclusion/Significance: All together, the high analytical sensitivity of the Q-PCR strategy, the low levels of intra- and inter￾assay variations, as well as the accuracy provided by the Lg-PCR based correction factor support this methodology as a key
laboratory tool for monitoring clinical reactivation and etiological treatment outcome in Chagas disease patients.

Introduction
Infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) remains a
major concern in 21 endemic countries of America, with an
estimated prevalence of almost 8 million infected people [1]. The
infection may be acquired mainly through the triatomid insect
vector, blood transfusion or the trans-placental route. Furthermore,
in areas under vector control, cases of congenital and transfusional
transmission are relatively emerging [2]. This parasitic disease shows
a variable clinical course, which ranges from asymptomatic cases, to
severe chronic stages characterized by low parasitaemia and cardiac
and/or gastrointestinal disorders [1].
Individuals from different endemic regions are infected with
distinct parasite populations that may play a role in pathogenesis,
clinical forms and severity of the disease [3]. Parasite populations
are classified into two main phylogenetic lineages, T. cruzi I (TcI)
and T. cruzi II (TcII) [4]; the later composed by five subdivisions
designated as TcIIa to TcIIe [5].
Current chemotherapies based on the nitrofuran nifurtimox,
and the nitroimidazole benznidazole, are unsatisfactory since these
compounds are almost exclusively effective in recent infections and
frequently have toxic side effects [6]. In this context, the
development of novel drugs is necessary [6].
After etiological treatment (tmt), the criterion of cure relies on
serological conversion to negative of the anti- T. cruzi antibody
response [2], but in patients initiating therapy at the indeterminate
phase, seroconversion usually occurs several years after treatment,
requiring long-term follow-up [7]. Moreover, parasitological response
to treatment is usually monitored by means of traditional methods
such as Strout, hemoculture or xenodiagnoses, which lack sensitivity,
and therefore are also inadequate for these purposes [2]. In this
context, quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) has the potential to
become a novel parasitological tool for prompt evaluation of
trypanocidal treatment. As a target for amplification, the nuclear
satellite DNA, represented in 104 to 105 copies in the parasite genome
is highly conserved [8–11] and therefore may provide accurate Q￾www.plosntds.org 1 April 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e419

PCR based measurements. Proper Q-PCR performance also requires
high quality DNA extraction procedures from blood samples, which
in most cases are collected in guanidine hydrochloride and EDTA
buffer (GEB) [12]. The co-purification of trace PCR inhibitors may
not impede amplification but may reduce its efficiency resulting in
erroneous quantification of the parasitic load.
Accordingly, we aimed to develop a satellite-DNA based Q￾PCR strategy for accurate quantification of T. cruzi loads in
peripheral blood samples along with an adequate DNA extraction
protocol. The following features have been regarded:
(i) A commercial DNA purification protocol based on silica￾membrane technology was adapted for GEB samples,
providing DNA lysates without PCR interfering substances.
(ii) A heterologous internal standard (IS) was incorporated to
each GEB sample to follow-up the yield and quality of DNA
extraction and PCR amplification.
(iii) The relative copy number of satellite repeats per genome,
according to the parasite lineage, was assessed for a more
accurate quantification of the parasitic load, by means of a
real-time PCR melting curve analysis (Lg-PCR).
Finally, we applied this Q-PCR strategy to: (1) calculate the
basal T .cruzi loads in blood specimens collected from Chagas
disease pediatric patients, (2) follow-up their parasitological
response to treatment with benznidazole, and (3) monitor T. cruzi
recrudescence and parasitological response to treatment in chronic
Chagas heart disease patients undergoing heart-transplantation
and receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was conducted according to the principles expressed
in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the ‘‘Ricardo Gutierrez’’ Children’s
Hospital and of the Fundacion ‘‘Rene Favaloro’’. All patients or
responsible adults provided written informed consent for the
collection of samples and subsequent analysis.
Parasite stocks
T. cruzi epimastigotes were grown in liver infusion tryptose
(LIT) medium containing 10% calf serum at 27–28uC. The
parasites were harvested and stored at 270uC. T. cruzi DNA was
purified after Phenol-Chloroform extraction and ethanol pre￾cipitation.
Reference T. cruzi stocks used as controls were: TcI (Silvio
X10 cl1, SN3, HA, Pal V2-2, Pav 00, G); TcIIa (CanIII); TcIIb:
(Tu18, JG, Gilmar, Y, Basileu, Mas cl1); TcIIc: (M5631, Cu￾Tom-229, Cu-Yaya-211), TcIId (Mn cl2, Bug 2148 cl1, SO3 cl5,
PAH 265, Tev 41), TcIIe (Cl Brener, Tul 77, Tep 6, Tep 7,
MC). They were kindly provided by Patricio Diosque (Uni￾versidad Nacional de Salta, Salta, Argentina), Andrea M.
Macedo (University Federal of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte,
Brasil), and Michel Tibayrenc (UR62 ‘‘Genetics of Infectious
Diseases’’, IRD Centre, Montpellier, France). Some T. cruzi I
strains were provided by Omar Triana Chavez (University of
Antioquia, Medellı´n, Colombia). Argentinean T. cruzi IIc isolates
were provided by Ricardo Gurtler (Universidad de Buenos Aires,
Argentina).
Chagas disease patients
(1) Peripheral blood samples collected from a cohort of 43 T.
cruzi-seropositive pediatric patients (mean age: 7.13 years; 15
days–18 years old) admitted between 2005 and 2006 at the
Parasitology Unit of the ‘‘Ricardo Gutierrez’’ Children’s
Hospital, a reference centre for diagnosis and treatment of
Chagas disease pediatric patients (Government of Buenos
Aires, Argentina). These patients were treated during 60 days
with benznidazole (5 to 8 mg/kg/day) [13]. Parasitic loads
were determined by Q-PCR at time of diagnosis (t1), at 7 (t2),
30 (t3) and 60 (t4) days of treatment. After t4, patients were
followed-up by qualitative kDNA-PCR at 6, 12 and 18
months post-tmt.
(2) Blood samples from three chronic Chagas heart disease
patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (Tx) in
2003–2005 were provided by the Transplant Unit of the
Instituto de Cardiologı´a y Cirugı´a Cardiovascular, Fundacio´n
‘‘Rene´ Favaloro’’, Buenos Aires, Argentina. [14].
All these protocols were approved by the ethical committees of
the corresponding institutions and written informed consents were
required from each patient or a responsible adult.
DNA extraction from peripheral human blood samples
Ten mL or 2 mL blood samples collected from T. cruzi infected
adults or infants, respectively, were immediately mixed with one
volume of 26lysis buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride
(Sigma, St Louis, USA) and 200 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (GE) [12].
QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) based extraction
was carried out from 400 ml of GEB and eluted with 200 ml of
water according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the Blood
and Body Fluid Spin Protocol, with slight modifications. Briefly,
since blood samples were initially mixed with one volume of GE
lysis buffer, treatment with proteinase K and ‘‘AL’’ lysis buffer
(which contains guanidine hydrocloride) were omitted. The
following steps were carried out following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Author Summary
Infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi),
causing American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease,
remains a major public health concern in 21 endemic
countries of America, with an estimated prevalence of 8
million infected people. Chagas disease shows a variable
clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic to chronic
stages with low parasitaemias, whose severest form is
heart disease. Diagnosis at the asymptomatic and chronic
stages is based on serological detection of anti-T. cruzi
antibodies, because conventional parasitological methods
lack sensitivity. Current chemotherapies are more effective
in recent infections than in the chronic adult population.
The criterion of cure relies on serological conversion to
negative, which may occur only years after treatment,
requiring long-term follow-up. In this context, we aimed to
develop a real-time PCR assay targeted to repetitive
sequences of T. cruzi for sensitive quantitation of parasitic
load in peripheral blood of infected patients. It was applied
to monitor treatment response of infected children,
allowing rapid evaluation of drug efficacy as well as
detection of treatment failure. It was also used for early
diagnosis of chagasic reactivation in end-stage heart
disease patients who received immunosuppressive drugs
after cardiac transplantation. This laboratory strategy may
constitute a novel parasitological tool for prompt and
sensitive evaluation of anti-parasitic treatment of Chagas
disease.

Phenol-chloroform based DNA extraction was carried out from
100 ml of GEB aliquots and resuspended in 50 ml water as
reported [15].
T. cruzi standard calibration curve
Cl Brener epimastigotes were added to non-infected human
blood to result in a concentration of 105 p/mL of reconstituted
blood and immediately mixed with one volume of 26 lysis GE
buffer. The resulting GEB was serially diluted 10-fold with non￾infected GEB to cover a range between 105 and 0.001 parasite
equivalents/mL. Total DNA was purified using the QiAmp DNA
Mini Kit based extraction method, as above described.
T. cruzi satellite DNA Q-PCR
An MJR-Opticon II device (Promega, USA) was used for
amplification and detection. The 20 mL reaction tube contained
0.5 mM of novel primers Sat Fw (59-GCAGTCGGCK￾GATCGTTTTCG-39) and Sat Rv (59-TTCAGRGTTGTTT￾GGTGTCCAGTG-39), 3 mM MgCl2, 250 mM of each dNTP,
0.5 U of Platinum Taq polymerase, (Invitrogen, Life Technolo￾gies, USA) SYBR Green (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA) at a
final concentration of 0.56and 2 mL of sample DNA. After 5 min
of pre-incubation at 95uC, PCR amplification was carried out for
40 cycles (94uC for 10 s, 65uC for 10 s and 72uC for 10 s). The
plate was read at 72uC at the end of each cycle.
Internal standards of Q-PCR
A linearized p-ZErO plasmid containing a sequence of
Arabidopsis thaliana was used as a heterologous internal standard
(IS). All clinical samples were co-extracted with 200 pg of
recombinant plasmid, which was assumed as 1 arbitrary unit
(AU) of IS. This amount of IS input was chosen because the
amplicons are detected at approximately the Cycle threshold (Ct)
number 20, the mid point of the dynamic range of the PCR. For
each Q-PCR test, the IS was added to 400 ml of GEB lysate,
immediately before the DNA extraction procedure.
The standard calibration curve for the IS was carried out using
the same reconstituted blood samples as for the T. cruzi calibration
curve: those samples containing 105
, 104 and 103 p/mL were
spiked with 2 AU of IS, those containing 100, 10 and 1 p/mL
were spiked with 0.2 AU of IS, and those containing 0.1, 0.01 and
0.001 p/mL were spiked with 0.02 AU of IS. Two non-infected
blood samples with and without IS DNA were used as negative
controls of the extraction procedure.
The IS was quantified using 1 mM of primers, IS Fw (59-
AACCGTCATG GAACAGCACGTAC-39) and IS Rv (59-
CTAGAACATTGGCTCCCGCAACA-39). All other PCR re￾agents and cycling conditions were identical to those used for T.
cruzi Q-PCR.

Qualitative PCR detection of T. cruzi kDNA
Post-treatment follow-up of parasitological response to benzni￾dazole in pediatric and heart transplanted patients was conducted
by means of kDNA-PCR as previously reported [14,16].
Determination of the satellite/P2a ratio
In order to analyze the variability in the number of satellite
sequences detected by Q-PCR, comparative quantification was
performed using as a normalizer the single copy ribosomal protein
P2a gene (GenBank accession number XM_800089).
Assays for quantification of P2a gene were performed using
1 mM of primers P2a Fw (59-ATGTCCATGAAGTACCT￾CGCC-39) and P2a Rv (59-GCGAATTCTTACGCGCCCTCC￾GCCACG-39). All other PCR reagents were used at the same
concentrations as for T. cruzi Q-PCR. After 5 min of pre￾incubation at 95uC, PCR amplification was carried out for 40
cycles (94uC for 10 s, 60uC for 15 s and 72uC for 10 s). The plate
was read at 72uC at the end of each cycle.
Identification of parasites according to the number of
satellite sequences detected per genome by Lg-PCR
Since TcI and TcIIa parasites have a lower number of satellite
sequences than TcIIb/c/d/e parasites, we have developed a
method to distinguish between both groups according to the
melting temperatures (Tm) of their corresponding amplicons to
enable more precise parasitic load assessments.
The identification of the type of satellite sequence was
performed using 0.5 mM of primers TcZ1 (59-CGAGCT￾CTTGCCCACACGGGTGCT-39) and Sat Rv (59-TTCAGRG￾TTGTTTGGTGTCC AGTG-39). All other PCR reagents were
used at the same concentrations as for T. cruzi Q-PCR. The PCR
conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95uC for 5 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 94uC for 10 s, 65uC for 10 s and 72uC for
10 s with fluorescence acquisition at 81.5uC and a final step of
2 min at 72uC. Amplification was immediately followed by a melt
program with an initial denaturation of 5 s at 95uC and then a
stepwise temperature increase of 0.1uC /s from 72–90uC.
Since satellite DNA is arranged in tandem repeats, if more than
0.05 parasites (equivalent to approximately 10 p/mL) are loaded
in the reaction tube, a satellite sequence dimer is amplified giving
place to a melting temperature peak typically above 86uC for both
lineage groups.
Satellite sequences were obtained by direct sequencing of
satellite DNA amplicons obtained with TcZ1 and TcZ2 primers
(GenBank Accession numbers EU728662-EU728667). Sequence
alignment was conducted using MEGA version 4 [17].
Normalization of parasite loads according to the internal
standard and parasite satellite sequence group
The parasite load in the clinical sample was normalized respect
to the standard curve according to (1) the efficiency of the DNA
extraction procedure measured by the amplification of the IS, and
(2) the parasite lineage group. The following equation was used:
Np/mL= (Np/well6LF / AU) / V, where Np/mL is the number of
parasites per millilitre of blood, Np/well is the number of parasites
per well, LF is the lineage factor, AU are the arbitrary units of IS
quantified and V is the volume of extracted DNA sample used per
reaction.

85uC, whereas Group II render amplification products with melting temperatures below 85uC.

Results
Analytical sensitivity and reproducibility of Q-PCR with
purified DNA and reconstituted blood samples
The analytical sensitivity of the Q-PCR was tested by using
serial dilutions of purified T. cruzi DNAs from TcI (Silvio X10 cl1)
and TcIIe (Cl Brener) reference stocks. The detection limits were
2 fg and 0.2 fg DNA per reaction tube with a dynamic range of
107 and 108 for Silvio X10 cl1 and Cl Brener stocks, respectively
(data not shown). These detection limits correspond to 0.01 and
0.001 parasite genomic equivalents considering that one parasite
cell harbors approximately 200 fg of DNA. Furthermore, we
tested the operational parameters of Q-PCR in reconstituted -
blood samples spiked with known quantities of Cl Brener and
Silvio X10 cl1 cultured epimastigote cells. The dynamic range of
Q-PCR performed with samples reconstituted with Silvio X-10
was 0.1–105 p/mL and with those spiked with Cl Brener was
0.01–105 p/mL (Figure 1).
The reproducibility of the Q-PCR assay at 100 p/mL and 1 p/
mL was estimated by testing each reconstituted sample 15 times in
the same PCR run. The coefficients of variation of the Ct values
were 1.27% and 2.30%, respectively for Cl Brener and 1.60% and
5.42%, respectively for Silvio X10 cl1.
The reproducibility of the DNA extraction was also char￾acterised: aliquots from the same GEB-reconstituted samples
containing 10 Cl Brener p/mL were processed in twenty
independent DNA purification experiments. For each of the 20
DNA lysates, the p/mL were measured in triplicate PCR runs and
a mean value was calculated. The coefficient of variation of the Ct
values among the 20 mean values was 1.69%.
Estimation of the relative numbers of satellite DNA
copies per genome for different Trypanosoma cruzi
lineages
In order to evaluate if the differences in the detection limits of
the Q-PCR obtained from Cl Brener or Silvio X10 cl1 samples
were related to a different copy number of satellite repeats in their
respective genomes, the amounts of satellite sequences, relative to
the single copy gene encoding the ribosomal-P2a protein, were
estimated for parasite stocks belonging to the 6 lineages (Table 1).
The stocks belonging to TcIIb/d/e lineages showed similar
amounts of satellite repeats (Table 1A), the M5631 stock (TcIIc)
harbored 2-fold less repeats than the aforementioned stocks
(Table 1A), whereas Can III stock (TcIIa) and six stocks belonging
to T. cruzi I from Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, harbored a 10-
fold lower number of satellite repeats (Table 1A and 1B). This is in
agreement with the analytical sensitivities obtained with purified
DNA and reconstituted samples of the reference stocks.
Distinction by Lg-PCR of T. cruzi groups according to the
relative number of satellite repeats
Two groups of lineages, T. cruzi I/IIa (group I) and T. cruzi II
(IIb,c,d,e) (group II) were clearly distinguished due to the
differential melting temperatures of their corresponding satellite
sequence amplicons, above or below 85uC, respectively (Figure 2).
The Lg-PCR was validated using a panel of 25 characterised
stocks (Table 2): five stocks belonging to TcI, one to TcIIa, six to
TcIIb, three to TcIIc, five to TcIId and the remaining five to
TcIIe.
The 99% confidence interval of the melting temperatures
depicted by the T.cruzi strains from group I (mean: 85.5uC; CI
99% 85.2–85.8) and II (mean: 84.4uC; CI 99% 84.2–84.7) did not
overlap. This distinction allows a more accurate parasite load
quantification by incorporating a correction factor (Lineage Factor
LF), according to the number of target sequences, when the
parasitic load is calculated.
Comparison of PCR inhibition using two extraction
methods in human samples
We extracted 55 GEB samples from Chagas disease patients
with the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit adapted protocol as well as with a
Ph-Chl based method. Using the Ph-Chl based method, we
detected traces of PCR inhibitors in 16 (29%) samples, whereas for
the commercial kit we did not detect PCR inhibitors in any of the
samples. The presence of PCR inhibitors was assessed by (1) the
low yield of IS amplification, giving rise to less than 0.1 AU of the
IS and (2) the improved yield of IS amplification when the DNA
lysate was diluted 1/100 prior to the Q-PCR run.
Out of the 16 samples that presented traces of PCR inhibitors
when extracted with the Ph-Chl based method, 4 were negative for
T. cruzi by both extraction methods, 3 rendered similar parasite
loads by both methods, 8 rendered higher parasite loads when
extracted with the commercial kit, and one rendered a positive
result only when extracted with the commercial kit. For the 39
samples extracted by Ph:Chl that did not contain PCR inhibitors,
similar results of T. cruzi quantification were obtained with both
methods of extraction. On the basis of these data, the QIAmp

DNA Mini Kit extraction protocol was selected for Q-PCR in
clinical samples.
Application of the Q-PCR assay to clinical specimens
A panel of human blood samples was analyzed using the Q￾PCR strategy, namely samples from seropositive pediatric patients
and chronic Chagas heart disease adults presenting clinical
reactivation after heart transplantation.
Table 3 describes the necessary steps for calculating the parasitic
loads, considering the lineage factor (LF), the AU of the IS and the
input volume of DNA sample. For example, in case Tx1c, the Q￾PCR alone quantified 0.39 p/mL, but the AU of the IS was 0.43,
and the LF was 10 (T. cruzi I), giving a final result of 9.07 p/mL,
which is 23 times higher than if the quantification had been made
based only on the Q-PCR crude measurement. In case Pd6, a
pediatric patient with very low parasitemia, the lineage could not
be determined since the low concentration of amplicons gave rise
to non-reliable melting temperature peaks and therefore the
parasitic load could only be expressed within a range of 10-fold. In
cases Tx1a and Tx2c, also with low levels of parasitemia, the
lineage was presumed from previous data obtained from
genotyped samples of the same patients, because it was
demonstrated that the T. cruzi lineages were persistent during
recrudescence leading to clinical reactivation in these patients
[14]. Cases Pd2a and Tx2b presented high parasitic loads, 512
and 468 p/mL, respectively. In both of them, dimers of the
satellite repeats were preferentially amplified when Lg-PCR was
performed, giving melting temperatures above 86uC (Table 3).
Thus, when the non-corrected Q-PCR results are above 10 p/mL,
the DNA lysate should be diluted to approximately 1 p/mL before
performing Lg-PCR.
The reproducibility of the whole Q-PCR assay was evaluated in
5 clinical samples from different Chagas disease patients covering
a range of 3 logarithms of parasitic loads (0.06 to 70.29 p/mL,
Table 4). For each peripheral blood sample (A to E, Table 4), the
entire protocol was carried out in 5 independent replicates. The
coefficients of variation of the Ct values and p/mL for the T.cruzi
Q-PCRs ranged from 1.30 to 5.49% and from 25.19 to 137,95%,
respectively, and those for the IS-PCRs ranged from 0.66 to
2.28% and from 9.56 to 29.51%, respectively (Table 4). The final
parasitic load measurements were inversely correlated with their
coefficients of variation, which ranged from 32.43 to 114.20%
(Table 4).
Follow-up of pediatric patients under treatment with
benznidazole
The pre-treatment parasitic loads were assessed in 43 children
with Chagas disease. Basal parasitic loads ranged from 640 to
0.01 p/mL, and were correlated to the patients’ ages at the time of
diagnosis (coefficient of Spearman: 20.5832, P,0.05) (Figure 3A).
Thirty eight of these patients were monitored by Q-PCR during
60 days of etiological treatment with benznidazole. Parasitic loads
were determined at time of diagnosis (t1) in 38 cases, at 7 (t2), 30
(t3) and 60 (t4) days of treatment in 31 cases.
Figure 3B and Table 3 show the parasitic response of these
patients during treatment monitoring. Q-PCR results at t2 were
negative in 24 out of 31 patients (77%), at t3 in 27 out of 31
patients (87%) and at t4 in 29 out of 31 patients (94%).

One of the Q-PCR positive patients at t4 was a 7 year-old boy
whose parasite load declined from 8.28 p/mL at t1 (Pd1a) to
0.1 p/mL at t2 (Pd1b), relapsing to 0.63 p/mL at t3 (Pd1c) and
1.16 p/mL at t4 (Pd1d) (Figure 3B, red triangle, Table 3).
The other Q-PCR positive patient at t4 was a 3 month old
infant who displayed detectable parasitic loads in the three
analysed samples; 512 p/mL at t1 (Pd2a), 0.43 p/mL at t3 (Pd2b)
and 0.75 p/mL at t4 (Pd2c) (Figure 3B, green triangle, Table 3).
Both patients were followed-up by kDNA-PCR with persistently
positive results at 6, 12 and 18 months post-tmt suggesting
treatment failure (data not shown).
Q-PCR based monitoring of Chagas disease reactivation
in heart-transplanted patients
Stored peripheral blood samples from three heart transplanted
patients infected with different parasite lineages and presenting
different patterns of clinical reactivation were retrospectively
analyzed using the Q-PCR strategy (Figure 4).
Case Tx1 presented positive Q-PCR results (0.22 p/mL) prior
to heart transplantation. Clinical reactivation was diagnosed at day
78 post-Tx by a skin chagoma biopsy and a positive Strout result.
The parasite population was characterized as group I by Lg-PCR.
Case Tx2 did not present positive PCR results before heart Tx,
but parasitemia became detectable 7 days post-Tx (2.66 p/mL).
Clinical reactivation was diagnosed at 92 days post-Tx due to
positive Strout findings. Upon etiological tmt, the parasitic load
decreased reaching undetectable levels at 21 days post-tmt. The T.
cruzi population was identified as group II.
Case Tx3 presented a parasite load of 0.02 p/mL 30 days
before Tx, showing a 10-fold increase (0.2 p/mL) 7 days after Tx.
The parasite load continued to rise until clinical reactivation was
diagnosed 38 days after Tx based on positive Strout findings.
Accordingly, the patient was treated with benznidazole and the
parasite load dropped rapidly, with negative Q-PCR findings at 14
days post-tmt, persisting PCR negative for 53 days. However, 70
days after tmt Q-PCR monitoring revealed detectable loads
(0.01 p/mL) (Figure 4). The bloodstream T. cruzi population was
identified as group II.
Discussion
Herein we report a highly sensitive, reproducible, accurate and
rapid real-time Q-PCR strategy for quantification of the T. cruzi
parasitic load in human blood samples. Indeed, this is a first
attempt to develop a real-time Q-PCR strategy for reliable T. cruzi
quantification, because it incorporates: (1) a commercial kit for
sample processing which minimizes carry-over of PCR inhibitors
and standardizes the yield and quality of DNA extraction, (2) a
closed-tube single-round PCR reaction which minimizes carry￾Table 4. Reproducibility of the Q-PCR and IS-PCR assays in clinical samples of Chagas disease patients.

over contamination, (3) an appropriate internal quality control and
(4) a correction of the parasitic load, according to the variation in
the number of target sequences between the different lineage
groups. This is a key step towards the standardization and
validation of in-house Q-PCR tests for application to routine
laboratory practice.
Although studies showing the advantages of real-time PCR for
screening and quantification of T. cruzi have recently appeared,
none have implemented procedures to normalize the DNA
extraction yield and the representativity of the PCR target
according to the lineage group. Some studies [18–20] have chosen
as an internal control a host DNA sequence, but the human DNA
content in blood can be highly variable, especially in immunosu￾pressed patients. In this work, the addition of a standardized
amount of a plasmid containing a heterologous sequence, allows
normalization of the DNA extraction yields and detection of false
negatives due to inhibition under any clinical situation.
Regarding the selected molecular target of amplification, Elias
et al. [8,11] and Vargas et al. [10] demonstrated that satellite
DNA is 4 to 9 times more abundant in TcIIb/d/e than in TcI
stocks. Herein, we have extended this analysis to all 6 T. cruzi
lineages, describing for the first time the satellite repeats of T. cruzi
IIa, IIc and IId representative stocks (GenBank Accession numbers
EU728662-EU728667). Indeed, we detected a 5 to 10-fold
variation in the satellite DNA content between group I (TcI/IIa)
and group II (TcIIb/c/d/e) parasite stocks (Table 1). Therefore,
this variability must be taken into account in order to calculate
accurately the parasitic loads. Accordingly, we have also designed
a highly sensitive real-time PCR procedure (Lg-PCR) to
distinguish T. cruzi group I (with lower satellite sequence copy
number and higher melting temperature) from group II lineages
(with higher satellite sequences copy number and lower melting
temperature). All the analyzed stocks rendered only one
temperature melting peak, including hybrid stocks like Cl Brener
although harboring both types of satellite sequences. This can be
explained by the fact that Cl Brener (Tc IIe) harbors ten times
more type II than type I satellite repeats [10] and due to
exponential amplification, only the predominant sequence type is
detected. The high analytical sensitivity of Lg-PCR makes it useful
for direct lineage group characterization in biological samples that
may not be typed using other typing methods [16,21,22].
Alternatively, a recently reported multiplex PCR strategy might
be useful for typing T.cruzi groups in clinical specimens [23] when
a Q-PCR test targeted to satellite sequences is carried out.
Sample processing and DNA extraction must also be optimized
for reliable quantification. In this direction, we adapted a
commercial kit, based on silica-membrane technology (QIAmp
DNA Mini Kit) for processing GEB samples. Phenol-chloroform
DNA extraction is a cost-effective method for qualitative PCR, but
traces of PCR inhibitors may be co-purified [24,25]. These
interfering substances may not impede Q-PCR amplification, but
could affect its efficiency leading to inaccurate results. In fact, we
detected traces of PCR inhibitors in 29% of the samples extracted
with Ph-Chl. When present, these inhibitors underestimated the

parasite loads in 67% of the positive samples, although they did
not seriously affect the positivity of the PCR. These results suggest
that Ph-Chl based extraction of GEB samples is not suitable for Q￾PCR but can be used for qualitative purposes.
In this report, we applied the Q-PCR strategy to blood samples
collected from patients under different clinical scenarios. Its wide
dynamic range allowed direct measurements in cases with high
parasitic loads such as immunosuppressed Chagas disease patients
and congenitally infected newborns, as well as in cases with low
parasitemias, such as patients at the indeterminate phase or under
etiological treatment. In this sense, the coefficients of variation of
the Q-PCR measurements obtained from clinical samples were
similar to those obtained from reconstituted blood samples
(Table 4). When applied to newborns, infants and children with
T. cruzi infection, Q-PCR estimated their basal parasitic loads in a
vast range, between 0.01 and 640 p/mL of blood (Figure 3A). The
highest parasitic loads observed in the younger pediatric
population are in agreement with the results obtained by
conventional parasitological and kDNA-PCR analysis [15,26].
Moreover, the lower parasitic loads detected in the older pediatric
patients reflect their evolution to the indeterminate phase of
congenital infection [15]. Furthermore, we were able to follow-up
their parasitological responses to treatment with benznidazole
(Figure 3B) with a favorable outcome in 94.7% (36/38) cases. It is
worth to note that at t3, under 30 days of tmt, 4 patients still
showed detectable parasitic loads. At the end of tmt (t4) 2 of them
became Q-PCR negative and remained negative during 18
months of post-tmt follow-up. This observation emphasizes the
importance of a treatment regimen of 60 days. Interviews with the
mothers of the two patients who persisted Q-PCR positive at t4
revealed the non-adherence in one of them (Pd2, Table 3 and
Figure 3B, green triangle), whereas in the other case (Pd1, Table 3
and Figure 3B, red triangle) persistence of parasitemia indicated
lack of parasitological response to benznidazole. These cases
demonstrate the usefulness of the Q-PCR assay as surrogate
marker for early detection of treatment failure. Two pediatric
patients (Figure 3B, pink and yellow squares) presented an increase
of their parasitic loads from t1 to t2, showing a favorable
parasitological response to treatment in the samples collected at t3
and t4, fact that was confirmed by means of kDNA-PCR in the
successive post-tmt controls (data not shown). The lower parasitic
loads detected at t1, before initiation of tmt, compared with t2,
might be due to natural fluctuations of the parasitemia in chronic
Chagas disease patients [27].
In this context, it is important to analyze serial blood samples to
be able to observe an increasing or decreasing tendency in the
parasitic loads in chronic patients under treatment.
The Q-PCR test was also used for early detection of T. cruzi
reactivation after heart transplantation. This was visualized
through the increment of the parasitic loads in all patients who
presented clinical manifestations of reactivation [14]. In case Tx1,
the patient is infected with T. cruzi I, and the number of parasites
increased from 0.22 p/mL (5 days pre-Tx) to 9.07 p/mL (78 days
post-Tx) when the patient presented signs and symptoms of skin
reactivation and patent parasitemia [14]. In the other two tested
cases, Tx2 and Tx3, who were infected with group II populations,
the parasitic loads increments were notably higher (Table 3 and
Figure 4). In Tx3, treatment with benznidazole after reactivation
achieved transitory parasitological response because samples
collected at 44 and 70 days after tmt were Q-PCR positive
(Figure 4). Parasite relapse was confirmed by means of kDNA￾PCR in successive samples until a second episode of clinical
reactivation was diagnosed [14]. In Tx cases, the Q-PCR allowed
to detect parasitic load increase, previous to diagnosis of
reactivation, as well as to follow-up parasitological response
during treatment with benznidazole.
All together, the high analytical sensitivity of the Q-PCR
strategy, the low levels of intra- and inter-assay variation, as well as
the accuracy provided by the Lg-PCR correction, promotes this
method as a key laboratory tool to follow-up patients under
etiological treatment or at risk of clinical reactivation. This will be
of particular significance for future drug trials in which an early
assessment of efficacy or failure is mandatory [28].
