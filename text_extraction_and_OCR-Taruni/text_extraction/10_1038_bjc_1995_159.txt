Abstract
Thirty-three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck region were studied concerning p53 protein expression and
mutations in exons 4-9 of the p53 gene using
immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single
strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing.
Immunoreactivity was found in 64% and p53 gene mutations in
39% of the tumours. Thirty-three per cent of the immunopositive
and 50% of the immunonegative tumours were mutated within
exons 5-8. In one immunopositive tumour three variants of
deletions were observed. Sequencing of the p53 mutated,
immunonegative tumours revealed four cases with deletions, one


case with a transversion resulting in a stop codon and one case with
a splice site mutation which could result in omission of the
following exon at splicing. All mutations in the immunonegative
tumours resulted in a truncated p53 protein. No association
between p53 gene status and expression of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) or cell proliferation as judged by in vivo
incorporation of the thymidine analogue iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd)
was found.
