Abstract
Background: There is little knowledge about the effect of dyslipidaemia on the outcome after lung transplantation.
Thus, the aim of this retrospective single centre study was to analyse the impact of the plasma lipid profile on
mortality in lung transplant recipients. From January 2000 to December 2008 the charts of 172 consecutive lung
transplantation recipients were analysed. At baseline and after one year lipid profiles were routinely collected.
During the follow-up major cardiovascular events (MCE; beginning of dialysis, cerebrovascular insult or myocardial
infarction) were recorded. The follow-up period ended December 2010.
Findings: Over all total cholesterol (4.3 ± 1.6 vs. 5.4 ± 1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.0001), triglycerides (1.2 ± 0.7 vs. 2.4 ± 1.3 mmol/l,
p < 0.0001), HDL (1.5 ± 0.6 vs. 1.7 ± 0.6 mmol/l, p = 0.003) and TC/HDL ratio (3.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.6 ± 1.2, p = 0.002)
increased significantly after 1 year.
During the observational period 6.9% (10 patients) suffered a major cardiac event. In univariate analysis MCE was
associated with baseline TC: on average the event-group had a 33% higher baseline TC (5.6 vs. 4.2 mmol/l, OR 1.6,
CI 1.1 – 2.2, p = 0.02). The total mortality in the observational period was 25% (36 patients overall). In univariate
analysis mortality was associated with increased TC/HDL ratio. The non-survivors had on average a 22% higher
baseline TC/HDL ratio (3.6 vs. 2.8, HR 2.8, CI 1.2 – 3.5, p = 0.001). There was no association between mortality and
TC (p = 0.33), triglycerides (p = 0.34), HDL (p = 0.78) and creatinine (p = 0.73). In a multivariate model the hazard
ratio was 1.5 (1.2 – 1.9, p = 0.001) per increase of 0.4 TC/HDL ratio.
Conclusions: This study shows that the total cholesterol before transplantation is associated with the incidence of
MCE and the cholesterol/HDL ratio with mortality in lung transplanted recipients.

Findings
In the general population, dys- and hyperlipidemia are
major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases [1]. Less is
known about the importance of hyperlipidemia in lung
transplant recipients. Silverborn and colleagues have
shown that 5 years after lung transplantation 48% of the
patients developed a new hypercholesterolemia [2]. This
was recently confirmed by Nash et al. [3] and by Reed
et al. [4]. The later group compared lung transplant recipi￾ents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
to ones with other underlying diseases. With or without
COPD after lung transplantation the triglyceride levels
were significantly increased relative to pre-transplantation.
Interestingly the high-density lipoproteins (HDL) values
and the ratios of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) versus
HDL and total cholesterol (TC) versus HDL increased
significantly only in the COPD group. Whether these
changes have an impact on the further disease course re￾mains unclear. In a cohort of 230 lung transplant recipi￾ents, Stephany et al. demonstrated a strong association
between early post-transplant LDL values and renal func￾tion – the higher the former the worser the latter [5]. But
the height of serum LDL did not significantly correlate
with mortality. In the aforementioned study of Nash and
colleagues the estimated 10-years cardiovascular risk

(Framingham risk score) was low (< 10% in all but one
included patients – 87 out of 88) despite the changes in
lipid profile. The aim of our retrospective study was to
asses the impact of baseline serum lipid levels on outcome
in lung transplant recipients.
Following approval by the local Ethics Committee,
which waived the need for written informed consent for
this post hoc data analysis, a systematic chart review on
172 consecutive adult lung recipients transplanted from
January 2000 to December 2008 was performed. Clinical
and demographic data and lipid profiles (TC, triglycerides,
HDL, TC/HDL ratio, all values were fasting plasma
lipids) were collected at listing time (baseline) and at
around one year post transplantation, corresponding to
routine outpatient visits. None of the patients was on
statin medication. Follow-up data included occurrence
of major cardiovascular event (MCE; defined as need for
dialysis, cerebrovascular insult or myocardial infarction)
and all-cause mortality. The observational period ended
December 2010.
The immunosuppression protocol used at our institution
included a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with an antimetabol￾ite (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids.
Baseline values were compared with the 1-year follow
up values with Wilcoxon rank test. Univariate and step
down multivariate logistic regression was done for major
cardiovascular events and a cox proportional model for
survival (Covariates were age, underlying disease, gender;
keratinize before TPL and the lipid profiles). All calcula￾tions were done with Stat view 4.5 (abacus concepts,
Berkeley, CA, USA). Statistical significance was accepted
with p < 0.05 (two sided tests).
From the 172 consecutive patients twenty-eight had to
be omitted because of incomplete baseline data. Finally
144 lung transplant recipients with a minimal follow up
of two years were analyzed. Baseline characteristics of
the whole study population and each of the subgroups
(survivors vs. non-survivors, with MCE vs. without
MCE) are shown on Table 1. Over all TC (4.3 ± 1.6 vs.
5.4 ± 1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.0001), triglycerides (1.2 ± 0.7 vs.
2.4 ± 1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.0001), HDL (1.5 ± 0.6 vs. 1.7 ± 0.6
mmol/l, p = 0.003) and TC/HDL ratio (3.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.6 ±
1.2, p = 0.002) increased significantly after 1 year – for
details see Figure 1.
During the observational period 6.9% (10 patients) suf￾fered a MCE (Table 1). In univariate analysis MCE was
associated with baseline TC: on average the event-group
had a 33% higher baseline TC (5.6 vs. 4.2 mmol/l, OR
1.6, CI 1.1 – 2.2, p = 0.02). Interestingly the HDL was
significantly higher (1.5 vs. 1.9 mmol/l, p = 0.01) in the
patients that suffered a MCE. Furthermore, there was no
association with the TC/HDL ratio (p = 0.67) and triglycer￾ides (p = 0.28). There was also an association between MCE
and creatinine baseline level (74 vs. 87 μmol/l, p = 0.03):

Per increase of 3 mol/l baseline creatinine there was and
odds ratio of 1.03 (CI 1.01 – 1.07, p = 0.04). In a multivari￾ate model the odds ratio per increased 1.0 mmol/l total
cholesterol was 2.5 (1.2 – 6.1, p = 0.01).
The total mortality in the observational period was 25%
(36 patients overall). Cause of death were primary graft
dysfunction (n = 8), pneumonia (n = 3), sepsis (n = 12), car￾cinoma (n = 1), chronic rejection (n = 4), MCE (n = 4) and
misc (n = 4). In univariate analysis mortality was associ￾ated with increased TC/HDL ratio. The non-survivors
had on average a 22% higher baseline TC/HDL ratio (3.6
vs. 2.8, HR 2.8, CI 1.2 – 3.5, p = 0.001). There was no as￾sociation between mortality and TC (p = 0.33), triglycer￾ides (p = 0.34), HDL (p = 0.78) and creatinine (p = 0.73). In
a multivariate model the hazard ratio was 1.5 (1.2 – 1.9,
p = 0.001) per increase of 0.4 TC/HDL ratio.
Our study suggests that mortality and the incidence
of MCE is associated with increased pretransplant
baseline lipid levels in lung transplant recipients, more
precisely TC/HDL rate was associated with a higher
mortality and increased TC was associated with the
rate of MCE. Importantly the baseline ratio of TC/
HDL of survivors and non-survivors were in the nor￾mal range even though significantly different from
each other – whereas the baseline TC was in the ones
that suffered from a MCE above norm. While not
statistically significant, it is noteworthy that MCE
victims had a notably reduced TC/HDL ratio compared
to non-victims.
The underlying patho-mechanisms of hyperlipidemia
for mortality and cardiovascular events in lung transplant
recipients are probably the same as described in other pa￾tient groups influence on cholesterol transport, promotion
of inflammation, endothelial effects, production of media￾tors and thrombogenicity [4].
Interpretation of the higher HDL values after one year
and in the patients suffering from a MCE is difficult.
Higher HDL values after renal transplantation were also
seen in the study of Tse et al. [6]. The exact mechanism of
rising HDL after transplantation is so far to our knowledge
unclear.
Certainly the value of this evidence is limited due to
its retrospective character, but as long as we lack pro￾spective study data these findings might serve as ra￾tionale for further prospective research as well as an
argument starting lipid lowering medication even before
lung transplantation. Beginning a cholesterol lowering
therapy after transplantation as have Johnson et al. dem￾onstrated resulted in significantly better survival, fewer
episodes of and less severe graft rejection [7]. They also
showed that statin medication was associated with dec￾rements in long-term maintenance calcineurin inhibitor
dose as well as lower steroid dose supporting the grow￾ing evidence of immune modulatory effects of statins.
Figure 1 As shown in these box-plots (the box outlining 25th and 75th percentile, line showing median and whiskers depicting 90th
percentile) comparing the baseline values with the values after one year of the whole study population TC, triglycerides, HDL￾cholesterol and TC/HDL ratio increased significantly after 1 year. The grey line indicates the border of normal values, beneath the line are
normal values in TC, triglycerides and TC/HDL ratio, above the line for HDL. HDL indicates high-density lipoprotein and TC total cholesterol.

Recently Li and coworkers have shown in a single center
retrospective study via propensity score matching that
pravastatin was associated with the preservation of vital
capacity and hinders the development of bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome [8]. Furthermore, this data demon￾strates a prolonged survival with the use of pravastatin.
Taken together the actual body of evidence even in ab￾sence of a prospective randomized controlled trial might
support the use of statins in lung transplant recipients –
even before transplantation.
