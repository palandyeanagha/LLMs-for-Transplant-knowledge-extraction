Abstract
Immune suppressed organ transplant recipients suffer increased morbidity and mortality from primary cutaneous SCC. We
studied tumor microenvironment in transplant-associated SCC (TSCC), immune-competent SCC and normal skin by IHC, IF
and RT-PCR on surgical discard. We determined T cell polarization in TSCC and SCC by intracellular cytokine staining of T cell
crawl outs from human skin explants. We studied the effects of IL-22, an inducer of keratinocyte proliferation, on SCC
proliferation in vitro. SCC and TSCC are both associated with significantly higher numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells
compared to normal skin. TSCC showed a higher proportion of Foxp3+ T regs to CD8+ T cells compared to SCC and a lower
percentage of IFN-c producing CD4+ T cells. TSCC, however, had a higher percentage of IL-22 producing CD8+ T cells
compared to SCC. TSCC showed more diffuse Ki67 and IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) expression by IHC. IL-22 induced SCC
proliferation in vitro despite serum starvation. Diminished cytotoxic T cell function in TSCC due to decreased CD8/T-reg
ratio may permit tumor progression. Increased IL-22 and IL-22R expression could accelerate tumor growth in transplant
patients. IL-22 may be an attractive candidate for targeted therapy of SCC without endangering allograft survival.

Introduction
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most
common human cancer; in the great majority of cases, excision
with clear margins provides cure. In immune suppressed solid
organ transplant recipients (OTRs) however, the incidence of SCC
is more than 100 times greater than the general population [1].
Furthermore, transplant associated SCCs (TSCCs) are particularly
aggressive and OTRs are more susceptible to recurrence and
metastasis [2]. Some transplant recipients can develop hundreds of
rapidly growing SCCs, resulting in massive local tissue damage.
Extensive body surface area involvement also renders surgery, the
primary treatment modality, difficult and disfiguring. In the
absence of surgery, there are no medical treatments available for
SCCs in OTRs, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality
shortly after transplantation [2,3]. Thus, there is a critical need for
targeted medical treatments for these aggressive cancers in this
patient population.
The immune microenvironment associated with SCC is
dynamic, comprised of opposing forces driving tumor promotion
and tumor suppression [4,5,6,7,8]. Regulatory T cells (T regs) and
macrophage-derived angiogenic factors may directly support
proliferation and invasion by SCC [9], while CD8+ cytotoxic
cells and other factors in the adaptive and innate arms of the
immune system can protect the host.
We are particularly interested in IL-22 producing T cells in the
SCC microenvironment. IL-22 is traditionally thought to be
produced by CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (Th) including Th1,
Th17, and Th22, however a subset of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells
(Tc22) have also been shown to produce this cytokine
[10,11,12,13]. IL-22 is involved in inflammatory and wound
healing processes and mediates its effects via a heterodimeric
receptor that is highly expressed within various tissues [14].
Epithelial cells of the skin and other organs such as the respiratory
and digestive tracts are its primary targets. Binding of IL-22 to its
receptor results in activation of signaling pathways that lead to
induction of genes involved in cell cycle progression and

prevention of apoptosis [15]. In psoriasis, a benign inflammatory
skin disease characterized by hyperproliferative keratinocytes, IL￾22 induces inflammation, mediates keratinocyte proliferation, and
inhibits keratinocyte terminal differentiation [16,17,18].
In contrast, the role of IL-22 in proliferation and progression of
human skin cancers like SCC remains undefined. In the present
study, we aimed to establish the role of IL-22 in SCCs in both
immune competent and transplant recipients and to evaluate the
immune microenvironment for the numbers and polarization
states of tumor-associated T cells. We directed our attention to
differences between SCC and TSCC in order to gain insight into
the mechanisms that drive their vastly disparate clinical behaviors.
Our results show TSCCs, are more proliferative, exhibit a
distinct T cell mediated response favoring tumor growth and T cell
polarization that favors production of IL-22, and show more
diffuse expression of IL-22R. Such findings suggest a model that
may account for their clinical presentation; therapeutic interven￾tion directed towards IL-22 could provide a new treatment
modality for these highly aggressive and sometimes fatal forms of
SCCs.
Results
Transplant Associated SCC (TSCC) is More Proliferative
than SCC from Immune Competent Patients
Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk for
developing cutaneous SCC. SCCs in this group of patients tend to
be more numerous, more aggressive and also has increased
propensity to grow more rapidly. [19]. Transplant patients
included in the study presented met criteria for catastrophic
carcinomatosis defined by Berg and Otley in 2002 [3] to include
(1) severe field disease; or (2) .10 SCCs excised in a one year time
period, or history of in transit, regional or distant metastatic
disease. Thus, these patients represented transplant recipients with
the most severe skin cancer burden. All tumors specimens evaluate
were obtained from AJCC Stage 1 primary cutaneous SCC. [20]
We performed immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, a marker
for proliferation, to assess the proliferative rate of SCC versus
TSCC. Both SCC and TSCC showed significant proliferative
activity (Figure 1a and b). We found that Ki-67 expression is
increased approximately 2-fold in TSCC as compared to SCC
(55.0867.3 cells/mm2
6105 versus 30.1267.1 cells/mm2
6105
mean 6 SEM p,0.05; Figure 1c). Notably, the pattern of Ki-67
expression was also different between these two groups. In SCC,
Ki-67+ cells were present along the periphery of tumor nests, i.e.
the leading edge of the carcinoma. In contrast, transplant
associated SCCs not only showed positivity at the invasive edge;
they also demonstrated Ki-67 positivity in aggregates within the
tumor (arrows). Double label immunofluorescence showed Ki-67
was positive for the nucleus of cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) positive
cancer cells but not CD3 positive cells (Figure 1e and 1d);
suggesting proliferating cells are keratinocytes rather than immune
cells.
SCC and TSCC Microenvironments are Characterized by
Significantly Higher Numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ T Cells
Compared to Normal Skin
As host immunity can regulate tumor behavior, we set out to
characterize the number, type, and distribution of tumor￾associated T cells in the SCC and TSCC microenvironment
(Figure 2). We found significantly greater numbers of CD3+ T cells
associated with SCC and TSCC compared to normal skin (SCC
122.4467.30 cells/mm2
6105 and TSCC 68.7367.38 cells/
mm2
6105 vs. Normal 22.5660.73 cells/mm2
6105
, mean 6
SEM, p,0.01; Figure 2a). There were also significantly greater
numbers of CD8+ T cells associated with SCC and TSCC
compared to normal skin (SCC 95.7069.92 cells/mm2
6105 and
TSCC 48.2268.38 cells/mm2
6105 vs. Normal 6.8862.56 cells/
mm2
6105
, mean 6 SEM, p,0.05; Figure 2b). Both CD3+ and
CD8+ T cells were more abundant in SCC compared to TSCC.
We also observed that CD3+ and CD8+ T cells predominantly
aggregated in the peritumoral regions while relatively few T cells
were located within tumor nests.
The FoxP3+:CD8+ T Cell Ratio is Higher in TSCC
We wanted to assess whether T-regs are present in TSCC and
SCC. We performed IHC for Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), a known
marker for T regs, on human SCC and TSCC. Representative
images are shown (Figure 2c). Cell counts for Foxp3 showed
significantly increased number of FoxP3+ cells in both SCC and
TSCC compared with normal skin (TSCC 34.3264.89 cells/
mm2
6105 and SCC 43.7266.96 cells/mm2
6105 vs. none in
normal skin, p,0.01). Triple label immunofluorescence confirmed
the presence of CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ cells, in both SCC and TSCC
tissue (Figure 2e and f). While the absolute numbers of FoxP3+
cells associated with SCC were similar to TSCC, the proportion of
FoxP3+cells r to cytotoxic (CD8+
) T cells was significantly
increased (,2 fold) in TSCC (TSCC 0.9760.22 vs. SCC
0.4560.05, p,0.05; Figure 2d), indicating a tumor permissive
environment in TSCC.
Tc22 Cells are Increased and Th1 Cells are Decreased in
TSCC
We were interested in T cell polarization in TSCC vs. SCC.
Th1 cells, of which IFN-c+ secreting CD4+ cells are a prototypic
example, are known to play a role in anti-tumor immunity [21]. In
contrast, IL-22 producing T cells (Th22 or Tc22) can support
keratinocyte proliferation and potentially accelerate tumor growth.
TSCC has been associated with a Th2 phenotype while
keratinocyte proliferation in psoriasis has been linked to Th17
and Th22 phenotype. Thus, Th1, Th2, Th17, Th22 and CD8+
IFN-c and IL-22 producing T cells might all be important in the
TSCC environment. Thus, we evaluated the percentages of Th1
(IFN-c+
/IL-172), Th2 (IL-4+
), Th17 (IL-17+
) and Th22 (IL-22+
/
IL-172) CD4+ and CD8+ cells from 20 SCC and 12 TSCC
explants We collected T cell ‘‘crawl-outs’’ from SCC explants.
While, the percentages of Th2 and Th17 cells were comparable in
SCC and TSCC, we found that TSCC was associated with an
increased percentage of IL-22 producing CD8+ T cells (TSCC
4.2% 61.2% vs. SCC 2.2% 60.75%, p,0.05) and decreased
numbers of CD4+ Th1 T cells (TSCC 15.1% 62.3% vs. SCC
25.1% 63.2%, p,0.05; Figure 3). The decreased percentage of
Th1 cells may skew the balance of pro- and anti-tumor forces
toward a ‘‘tumor permissive’’ environment. Increased IL-22
producing cells might contribute to enhanced proliferation of
TSCC.
The Expression of IL-22 and Related Cytokines is
Increased in SCCs, TSCCs and their Adjacent Peritumoral
Skin
To further assess the expression of IL-22 within the tissue, we
performed reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) on mRNA
extracted from SCC, TSCC, their respective adjacent non-tumor
bearing skin and normal skin from healthy volunteers. RT-PCR
analysis showed that mean IL-22 mRNA expression was increased
approximately 30-fold in SCC and 8-fold in TSCC compared to
normal skin (p,0.05; Figure 4). Even more striking, there was

significantly increased expression of IL-22 in the peritumoral
regions of SCC and TSCC compared to normal skin. IL-22
mRNA was increased 111-fold in SCC and 97-fold in TSCC
peritumoral skin. In general, we found that the entire family of IL￾10 cytokines including IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22 and IL-24 was
increased in tumor compared to normal skin.
IL-22 Receptor and pSTAT-3 are Upregulated in TSCC and
SCC
Binding of IL-22 to its receptor results in tyrosine phosphor￾ylation of JAK and subsequent activation of downstream signal￾transducer-and-activator (STAT) molecules, of which STAT-3 is
the principal mediator [22,23,24]. Particularly, STAT-3 has been
implicated in both the initiation and promotion stages of
cutaneous carcinogenesis, regulating keratinocyte survival and
proliferation following ultraviolet irradiation [25,26,27,28].To
investigate if this pathway is upregulated in SCCs, we stained
SCC (n = 5), TSCC (n = 5), and normal skin (n = 5) for IL-22, IL￾22 receptor and phosphorylated STAT-3 (pSTAT-3). Represen￾tative images are shown (Figure 5). We found diffuse expression of
IL-22 in transplant SCC and SCC from immune competent
patients. We also found increased expression of IL-22 receptor at
the leading edge of the invasive front in SCC (Figure 5a); this was
in contrast to TSCC, which showed diffuse IL-22 receptor
expression (Figure 5b). Diffuse IL-22 receptor expression mirrored
diffuse expression of Ki67 expression in TSCC (Figure 1). pSTAT￾Figure 1. Transplant associated SCC (TSCC) shows diffuse Ki-67 staining and increased numbers of Ki-67+ cells. Representative

(Figure 5c).
IL-22 Enhances the Proliferation of Human Cutaneous
SCC
Since IL-22 drives proliferation in normal keratinocytes in
culture, we wanted to investigate whether IL-22 can induce
proliferation of SCCs. A431 SCC cells were cultured for 48 hours
with complete medium (CM) or under serum starvation conditions
with or without the indicated cytokines. Culture with CM without
IL-22 or IL-24 resulted in robust proliferation of A431 cells. When
A431 were serum starved (0.1%FBS) they did not proliferate.
Addition of IL-22 (40 or 100 ng/ml) rescue of serum starved A431
cells. A431 cells formed larger colonies when treated with IL-22
compared to the cells in 0.1% FBS or IL-24 as visualized with light
microscopy (Figure 6A). Ki67 staining confirmed the hyperproli￾ferative state of A431 cells cultured with IL-22 (Figure 6B). Ki67+
cells were predominantly localized at the periphery of the colony

in slow growth conditions, whereas those cells were also found
within and throughout the colony in rapid proliferation conditions.
These observations correspond to our findings with TSCC
(Figure 1) where we found Ki67+ cells within tumor nests. Finally,
addition of IL-22 at 100 ng/ml resulted in significant increase of
proliferation of A431 cells by approximately 8-fold compared to
growth of serum starved cells (p,0.05). These results suggest that
IL-22 might play a role in driving SCC proliferation in transplant
patients.
Discussion
Over 250,000 organ transplant recipients (OTRs) currently live
in the United States and approximately 30,000 transplant
surgeries will be performed this year [29]. As these patients live
longer, morbidity may result not from the transplant itself, but
from other disease processes. The increased incidence of skin
cancer, especially squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is well-known
[1,19,30,31,32,33]. However, few studies to date have attempted
to explain the more aggressive course of SCCs in the transplant
population in specific terms. In this report, we endeavored to do
that by examining the differences between SCCs in immune
competent patients and in transplant recipients at the cellular
level. Our results demonstrated evidence of increased proliferative
activity in TSCC compared to SCC and an altered immune
microenvironment. These findings enable us to propose a model
that may help explain the rapidly growing and aggressive nature of
TSCC.
A general assessment of the tumors’ relative proliferative activity
was first performed using Ki-67. This marker has previously been
shown to correlate with tumor grade, and can help identify
aggressive carcinomas [34], and is a strong prognostic indicator for

melanoma [35]. We discovered a two-fold increase in Ki-67
positivity in TSCC compared to SCC, which corresponds to high
risk clinical behavior. Unexpectedly, we also found a distinct
pattern of Ki-67 expression in TSCCs. Previous reports described
Ki-67positivity along the periphery of SCC tumor nests [36].
However, our IHC staining of TSCC showed Ki-67 positivity not
only at the invasive edge but also within the tumor nodule. Double
label immunofluorescence for keratinocyte markers CK5/6 and
Ki-67 confirmed that the proliferating cells were indeed SCC cells
(Figure 1e). These findings suggest that more proliferation occurs
in tumors from transplant patients than in immune-competent
patients. Furthermore, a lack of co-localization of Ki-67 with pan￾T cell marker CD3 may indicate that T cells are not proliferating
locally.
A significant finding in our current study is that TSCCs have
significantly increased IL-22 producing CD8+ cytotoxic T cells
(Tc) compared to SCCs in the immune competent group. While
IL-22 has been implicated in psoriasis [10,37,38,39], a benign
hyperproliferative keratinocyte disease that shares gene expression
patterns with SCC [40], mounting evidence suggests that IL-22
may also be implicated in malignant processes. IL-22 has been
shown to support the growth of mantle cell lymphoma [41],
anaplastic large cell lymphoma [42], hepatocellular carcinoma
[43] and colon carcinoma through STAT3 activation [44,45].
Most recently, IL-22 demonstrated pro-tumoral activity in human
pancreatic cancer cell line via inducing the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-apoptotic factor Bcl￾XL [46]. The function of IL-22 in cutaneous SCC, however, has
not been identified yet. Our findings of increased gene expression
of IL-22 and its related family of cytokines in tumor tissue, as well
as increased protein expression of IL-22, IL-22R, and the
downstream modulator pSTAT-3, all reinforce the importance
of the IL-22 pathway in TSCCs. Differences between the SCC
and TSCC microenvironments may translate exponentially when
one considers the difference in disease burden between the two
groups. An immune competent patient ordinarily presents with a
single SCC whereas transplant patients with catastrophic SCC
present with tens to hundreds of lesions comprising upward of
50% body surface area. In this clinical presentation, increased IL￾22 production by Tc22 cells and increased IL-22 receptor density
set the stage for sustained accelerated carcinomatosis in transplant
patients with catastrophic disease.
Our functional studies provide evidence that IL-22 augments
the proliferation of a human cutaneous SCC cell line (A431) in
culture in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, we observed IL-22-
driven proliferation of SCC cells was most pronounced under
starvation conditions (Figure 6). This supports the hypothesis that
IL-22 in the tumor microenvironment might drive SCC prolifer￾ation under high metabolic demand associated with tumor growth
and diminished enrichment of the environment secondary to tissue
necrosis.
IL-22 may also have other effects in addition to its role in
proliferation. One study revealed IL-22 can augment production
of immunosuppressive cytokines, and diminish T cell production
of interferon (IFN)-c, the prototypical Th1 cytokine [46]. Th1 cells
support Tc and NK cell anti-tumor responses, and in some cases
drive anti-tumor immunity in the absence of Tc cells. Thus, Th1
and Tc responses are key mediators of anti-tumor immunity and
are likely important in generating responses against SCC.
Although we have not directly tested IL-22’s effect on IFN-c
production in SCC, our results also reveal a decrease in
percentage of IFN-c producing T cells in transplant recipients.
Within the tumor milieu, other factors may additionally
contribute to the aggressive nature of TSCC. Typically, anti￾Figure 4. IL-22 expression is increased in SCC, TSCC, and juxtatumoral skin. The relative mRNA expression of IL-22 relative to Human Acidic

tumor response involves processing tumor-associated antigens and
the subsequent generation of Th and cytotoxic Tc cells [6,8].
CD4+ T cells prime tumor-specific Tc cells so that these CD8+ T
cells can directly lyse tumor cells [47]. Since T cell mediated
immunity is central to controlling tumor growth, we characterized
and compared tumor-associated T cells in SCC, TSCC and
normal skin. Our results show fewer T cells, particularly CD8+ T
cells, in our TSCC samples compared to SCC samples, supporting
the recent report that decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating
CD8+ T cells is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes of
lymph node metastasis [48].
We also found more Foxp3+ cells in tumor tissue compared
to normal skin. Foxp3+ include T reg cells which are known to
promote immune tolerance [49]. While crucial for preventing
autoimmunity [50], T regs may also suppress beneficial anti￾tumor immunity [51,52] and aid in evasion of immune
surveillance. Specifically, they can regulate the immune response
by suppressing the proliferation and cytokine production of
effector T cells [53,54]. Studies have also shown that an
increased presence of T regs is correlated with poorer prognosis
and decreased survival rates in gastric [51], breast [55] and
ovarian carcinomas [56,57]. Notably, we showed that TSCCs
contain a higher ratio of T regs to Tc cells compared to SCC.
This disruption of the T reg to Tc cell balance may result in a
compromised ability to mount an anti-tumor response, contrib￾uting to the aggressive nature of TSCC.
A question that remains to be addressed is what causes the
disparate T cell and cytokine expression profiles between SCC and
TSCC. An obvious difference between these patients is iatrogenic
immunosuppression. Although the nature of this study does not
allow correlation of results with particular drugs and dosages, in
general, OTRs are placed on high-dose immunosuppressive drugs,
such as cyclosporine A and azathioprine. A number of studies have
suggested immunosuppressive medications contribute to an
increased risk for skin cancer through both direct carcinogenic
effects as well as decreased immunosurveillance [58,59]. However,
the effects and degree of immune cell alterations by these drugs
and their mechanisms of action remain an active area of research.
In general, the incidence of skin cancer is proportional to the level
of immune suppression, as CD4 counts are significantly lower in
OTR with SCC versus those patients without such malignancy
[59].
An important implication of our study is in the treatment of
aggressive SCCs, especially in the transplant population. Current￾ly, many transplant recipients exhibit catastrophic carcinomatosis
that is beyond conventional surgery. Since there are also no
effective medical treatments for these patients, one option is to
remove the patient from immune suppression. Although possible

in renal transplant patients, this also necessitates a return to
dialysis as the graft often fails and this drastically diminishes their
life expectancy over time [2,3]. In addition, this strategy cannot be
used with heart, heart-lung, or liver transplant recipients [3]. Prior
efforts at immune based treatments have also been largely
unsuccessful because such strategies are centered on using myeloid
dendritic cells (mDC) to induce Th1 type responses. In transplant
patients in particular, Th1 induction is associated with graft
rejection, rendering this approach unsuitable for SCCs in OTRs.
Our previous studies showed that mDCs from SCC do not
stimulate T cell proliferation [60], thus making the success of this
approach less attractive. Therefore, we believe targeting the IL-22
pathway may prove to be a useful therapy for TSCCs, while
sparing the transplanted organ by continuing suppression of the
autoimmune response.

seen throughout the tumor colonies. (c) Cell counts were performed after 72 hours of cultivation in the indicated conditions. The addition of 100 ng/
ml IL-22 to the starvation media (0.1% FBS) resulted in a hyperproliferation of tumor cells, yielding significantly greater cell numbers when compared
to those grown in serum starvation alone, or serum starvation supplemented with IL-22 (40 ng/ml) or IL-24 (40 ng/ml) (one-way ANOVA, p,0.001).

Increased Tc22 and Treg/CD8 May Affect TSCC Growth
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e62154

In summary, our findings provide strong evidence that TSCC
has a unique immune microenvironment that is conducive to
tumor proliferation as shown schematically in Figure 7. The
aggressive nature of TSCC may result from at least two opposing
forces: a) increased T regs and decreased CD8+ T cells, leading to
decreased immune surveillance, and b) increased exposure to IL￾22, which may provide a proliferative stimulus and accelerate
tumor growth. Although further work elucidating the role of IL-22
in SCC proliferation and invasion is warranted, our study sheds
light upon the possible role of IL-22 in tumorigenesis in vivo and
provides important information about tumor immunity in
transplant recipients. Furthermore, this study suggests that
targeting the IL-22 pathway may be an important, life-saving
therapeutic approach for aggressive SCCs in the transplant
population.
Materials and Methods
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained before
enrolling patients to participate in this study. Institutional Review
Board approval at NYU Langone Rockefeller and Weill- Cornell
was obtained before enrolling patients to participate in this study.
Written informed consent was obtained before their participation,
and the study was performed with strict adherence to the
Declaration of Helsinki Principles.
Skin Samples used in the Study
For immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, cutane￾ous stage 1 SCC and transplant-associated SCC samples were
obtained during Mohs micrographic surgery. Tumors were
obtained from sun-exposed regions of the face, head and neck.
Normal specimens were obtained by 3-mm punch biopsies from
non-sun exposed areas of donors without skin cancer. For flow
cytometry, tumor samples were obtained from debulking prior to
Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).
Immunohistochemistry
Standard procedures were used for immunohistochemistry as
previously described [61]. Briefly, frozen tissue sections of normal
skin (n = 5) and SCCs (n = 5–10) and TSCC (n = 10) were stained
with the following antibodies: CD3, CD8 (BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA diluted at 1:100), Foxp3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA
diluted 1:40), IL-22 (R&D systems; 1:25), IL-22 Receptor (Prosci;
1:250), KI-67 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:50), pSTAT3 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; 1:50). Biotin-labeled horse anti-mouse
antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was amplified
with avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) and developed
with chromogen 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO). Counterstaining was carried out with light green
(Sigma-Aldrich). Appropriate isotype controls were performed
with each immunohistochemistry experiment. Positive cells were
counted in the dermis around SCC tumor nests using NIH
IMAGE J software (Bethesda, MD), and cell counts per unit area
(mm2
6100,000) were determined [62].
Immunofluorescence
Standard procedures were used for immunofluorescence as
previously described (Fuentes-Duculan et al, 2010). Frozen skin
sections from SCC and TSCC lesions (n = 3–5) and normal skin
(n = 3) were fixed with acetone and blocked with 10% normal
goat serum (Vector laboratories) for 30 minutes. Primary
antibodies Foxp3, Ki-67, Cytokeratin 5/6 (Table S1) were
incubated overnight at 4uC and amplified with the appropriate
secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated to Alexa
Figure 7. The proposed model of accelerated development of TSCC. An increased proportion of T regs, combined with decreased numbers
of CD8+ and IFN-c producing T cells, leads to decreased tumor surveillance. Greater percentage of IL-22 producing T cells suggests an increased
proliferation stimulus. The overall imbalance could explain the rapidly proliferative nature of TSCC. IL-22 blockade may be an attractive candidate for
targeted SCC therapy, especially in the transplant population.

Fluor 488 or 568) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections
were then blocked with 10% normal mouse serum for 30
minutes and the second primary antibodies (CD4(647),
CD25(FITC), CD3(FITC), Ki-67(FITC)) were incubated at
4uC overnight and amplified with goat anti-FITC conjugated
to Alexa Fluor 488 the next day. Images were acquired using
appropriate filters of a Zeiss Axioplan 2 widefield fluorescence
microscope with a Plan Neofluar 2060.7 numerical aperture
lens (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) and a
Hamamatsu Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater,
NJ) controlled by MetaVue software (MDS Analytical Technol￾ogies, Downington, PA). Images in each figure are presented
both as single color stains (green and red or green, red and
blue) located above the merged image, so that localization of
two markers on similar or different cells can be appreciated.
Cells that co-express the two markers (green and red) are yellow
in color, while cells that co-express the three markers (green,
red and blue) appear as white. A white line denotes the
dermoepidermal junction. Dermal collagen fibers gave green
autofluorescence, and antibodies conjugated with a fluoro￾chrome often gave background epidermal fluorescence. Size
bar = 100 mm.
Skin Preparation and Flow Cytometry
SCC (n = 20) and TSCC (n = 12) specimens were obtained by
Mohs micrographic surgery. Surgical discard for ex-vivo T cell
phenotype analysis was obtained from 12 tumors from 6 transplant
recipients. Each of these was a renal transplant recipient. Four of
the 6 were on a regimen that included cyclosporine. Five were on
more than one drug. The mean age at transplant was 36. Mean
time on immune suppression at time of surgery was 21.6 years.
Data are summarized in Table S1. Samples were cultured
overnight in 2.4 U/ml Dispase II (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) at 4uC to separate the epidermis and dermis. T cells
were obtained by culturing the dermis in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 5% pooled human serum (Mediatech Inc.,
Manassas, VA), 0.1% gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 1% 1 M
HEPES buffer (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 48 hours at 37uC
and allowing them to spontaneously ‘‘crawl-out’’ into culture.
Thereafter, to obtain cells emigrated from the dermis, the
supernatants were collected and filtered with 40 mm pore nylon
cell strainers. Emigrated cells were activated for 4 hours using
25 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and 2 mg/ml ionomycin, in
the presence of 10 mg/ml brefeldin A (all from Sigma Aldrich, St
Louis, MO). EDTA (2 mM; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) was
added for 10 minutes on ice to stop activation. Cells were then
incubated in aqua marina live/dead dye (Invitrogen) on ice for 30
minutes for dead cell discrimination and subsequently fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde (BD Biosciences) on ice for 20 minutes. The
cells were permeabilized in FACSPerm (BD Biosciences), blocked
in 1:50 mouse serum (BD Biosciences), and incubated for 30
minutes on ice with the following anti-human, mouse monoclonal
antibodies: CD3-Pacific Blue (eBioscience), CD4-Phycoerythrin￾Cy7, CD8-PerCp-Cy5.5, IFN-c-Alexa Fluor 700 (BD Pharmin￾gen), IL-4-Phycoerythrin (BD Pharmingen), IL-17-Alexa Fluor
488 (eBioscience), and IL-22-Allophycocyanin (R&D Systems).
Detailed information of antibodies used is described in Table S1.
After incubation, cells were washed twice and collected. Samples
were acquired using an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR).
Live CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells were first gated and then
the frequencies of the cells producing indicated cytokines were
analyzed.
RNA Isolation
Total RNA isolation was carried out as described earlier [60,61]
Briefly, SCC (n = 9) and TSCC (n = 7) tumor samples were
removed at Mohs micrographic surgery, and patient-matched,
site-matched peritumoral skin were obtained at the time of repair
after clear margins were achieved. Normal skin was obtained from
normal volunteers (n = 9). All samples were snap-frozen and stored
in liquid nitrogen. Individual frozen samples were placed in 1 ml
of room temperature RLT Lysis buffer with 1% b-mercaptoeth￾anol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and immediately homogenized at full
power for 30 seconds using a PowerGen 1000 homogenizer (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Homogenates were sonicated on ice for
20 seconds at full power. DNA was removed with on-column
DNase digestion using an RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). RNA
was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. Total RNA concentration and
purity was evaluated using an Ultraspec 2100 prospectrophot￾ometer (Amersham Biosciences).
RT-PCR
The primer and probe used for IL-10 (Hs00961622_m1), IL￾19(Hs00604657_m1), IL-20 (Hs00218888_m1), IL-22
(Hs01574154_m1) and IL-24 (Hs01114274_m1) were from
Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The sequences of the
primers and probe for human acidic ribosomal protein (HARP)
are: HARP-forward, CGCTGCTGAACATGCTCAA, HARP-ß
reverse, TGTCGAACACCTGCTGGATG; HARP-probe, 6-
FAM TCCCCCTTCTCCTTTGGGCTGG-TAMRA (GenBank
accession no. NM-001002). The RT-PCR reaction was carried out
using 10 ng total RNA and EZ PCR Core Reagents (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The
samples were amplified and quantified on an Applied Biosystems
PRISM 7900 HT using the following thermal cycler conditions: 2
minutes at 50uC, 30 minutes at 60uC, 5 minutes 95uC; and 40
cycles of 15 seconds at 95uC followed by 60 seconds at 60uC. Each
sample and gene was normalized to the hARP gene, a
housekeeping gene.
Cell Culture and Cell Staining
A Cutaneous SCC cell line A-431 (ATCC) was cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS (starvation medium) at
37uC for 48 hours to synchronize cellular proliferation at G0
phase. Subsequently, cells were grown in one of the following five
conditions: 1) 0.1% FBS 2) 0.1% FBS +40 ng/mL IL-22 3) 0.1%
FBS +100 ng/mL IL-22 4) 0.1% FBS +40 ng/mL IL-24 and 5)
10% FBS (Full growth Media). Both IL-22 and IL-24 were
reconstituted in PBS prior to administration according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. After 72 hours, the cells were collected
for either immunofluorescence staining or cell counting. Immu￾nofluorescence procedure was similar to that outlined in the
paragraph above, with the use of proliferation marker Ki-67 as the
primary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. DAPI was used
to counterstain cell nuclei. Images were presented as both single
color stains (green or blue) as well as a merged image in order to
highlight the degree and distribution of proliferating cells. For cell
counting, cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted using
an automated cell counter (Countess Invitrogen Life Technolo￾gies).
Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise specified, statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism software. Comparisons of cell counts were
performed using a two-tailed, Student’s t-test, with p,0.05

considered significant. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for the
statistical comparison of flow cytometry data. Averaged results of
multiple experiments are presented as the arithmetic mean 6
SEM. RT-PCR values were normalized to hARP and the log2-
transformed. Here we have repeated measures experiments with
repeated measures (Tissue, LS and NL) within two groups of
patients defined by Immune Status (Immune Compromised or
Not). A mixed effect model was used with fixed effect
Tissue+ImmStatus:Tissue and random intercept for patients
within Immune Status (1|ImmStatus/Patient).
