Abstract
Background/Objective: Plasma-creatinine-based equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate are recommended by
several clinical guidelines. In 2009, Schwartz et al. adapted the traditional Schwartz equation to children and adolescents
but did not find different k-coefficients between children and adolescents (k = 36.5 for all patients). We reevaluated the
coefficient of the 2009-Schwartz formula according to sex and age in a pediatric population.
Patients/Methods: We used linear mixed-effects models to reestimate the 2009-Schwartz k-coefficient in 360 consecutive
French subjects aged 1 to 18 years referred to a single centre between July 2003 and July 2010 (965 measurements). We
assessed the agreement between the estimated glomerular filtration rate obtained with the new formula (called Schwartz￾Lyon) and the rate measured by inulin clearance. We then compared this agreement to the one between the measured
glomerular filtration rate and 2009-Schwartz formula, first in the French then in a Swedish cohort.
Results: In Schwartz-Lyon formula, k was estimated at 32.5 in boys ,13 years and all girls and at 36.5 in boys aged $13
years. The performance of this formula was higher than that of 2009-Schwartz formula in children ,13 years. This was first
supported by a statistically significant reduction of the overestimation of the measured glomerular filtration rate in both
cohorts, by better 10% and 30% accuracies, and by a better concordance correlation coefficient.
Conclusions: The performance and simplicity of Schwartz formula are strong arguments for its routine use in children and
adolescents. The specific coefficient for children aged ,13 years further improves this performance.

Introduction
Assessing the renal function is of utmost importance for the
diagnosis and prognosis of kidney diseases. Up to now, glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) has been the most widely used index in
clinical practice. However, determining the true GFR is cumber￾some, costly, and difficult to perform in everyday medical practice.
[1] The use of a GFR estimating equation as a noninvasive
alternative has been recommended by the clinical guidelines on
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) management [2,3] and many
formulas based on plasma creatinine (PCr) have been proposed,
both for adult and pediatric populations. [4] In 2002, the Clinical
Practice Guidelines of the National Kidney Foundation Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) recom￾mended the use of the formulas proposed by Schwartz et al. (1976)
or Counahan-Barratt et al. (1976) for the estimation of GFR in
children. [2].
In fact, PCr is the central component of these formulas; thus,
the accuracy of GFR estimation depends highly on the method
chosen for PCr measurement. Recently, important improvements
in laboratory techniques have permitted: 1) to improve the
specificity of creatinine measurement (using a kinetic colorimetric
compensated Jaffe´ technique or enzymatic methods) and 2)
standardization by the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)
method. [5,6] With these improvements, the results became
logically lower than those given by the classical Jaffe´ reaction; all
formulas established with previous PCr measurement methods are
no more adequate and should be revised in several respects. [7].
For example, childhood and adolescence are dynamic periods of
development with rapid changes in body size, shape, and

composition, which influence muscle mass and, consequently,
creatinine production. In 2009, using an enzymatic PCr assay,
Schwartz et al. adapted the traditional Schwartz equation to
children and adolescents [8] but did not demonstrate k-coefficient
changes with puberty (k = 36.5 for all patients) probably because
the studied population was suffering from mild to severe CKD and
notable growth retardation (height averaged at the 22.8 percentile
(range 5.5–51.3)).
The aims of the present study were: 1) to reestimate new k￾coefficients of the 2009-Schwartz equation according to sex and
age and assess the performance of the new equation (herein called
‘‘Schwartz-Lyon’’) in a French cohort of children and adolescents
with mild to moderate CKD and no significant growth retarda￾tion; and 2) to validate the revised formula on a different cohort.
Patients and Methods
The French cohort
This cohort consisted of 360 consecutive patients aged 1 to 18
years, who were referred to the Renal and Metabolic Function
Exploration Unit at Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France)
between July 2003 and July 2010 for measurement of inulin
clearance because of suspected or established renal dysfunction. A
written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their
families prior to measurement of the renal clearance of inulin. The
consent form contained information on to the procedure itself as
well as on the later use of the information in research works.
According to the French Law, concerning the use of a database
without direct identification of patients, it was not necessary to
obtain an ethical approval (law 2006–450, april 19th 2004;
Commission nationale de l’informatique et des liberte´s -CNIL).
Heights, weights, and ages were recorded. Weights and heights
were expressed in percentiles according to the CDC’s sex
appropriate weight-for age and length or stature-for-age growth
charts. [9] Growth retardation was defined by a length/stature
below the 3rd percentile on the growth charts.
This retrospective cohort was divided into two age groups: 218
children aged ,13 years and 142 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.
The age limits for adolescents were chosen according to the
original work of Schwartz et al. [10] Each participant may have
contributed several measurements. However, all children simulta￾neous measurements of inulin clearance and plasma creatinine
were made before age 13 and all adolescent simultaneous
measurements were made from 13 to 18 years old.
The Swedish cohort
Data on 109 patients were obtained from the Pediatric
Nephrology Unit at Karolinska University Hospital in Huddinge
(Stockholm, Sweden). The Swedish nephrology unit used the same
methods for renal evaluations (inulin clearance and creatinine
measurement) as the French center. [11,12].
Measurement of Plasma Creatinine
PCr was obtained with a kinetic colorimetric compensated Jaffe´
technique (Roche Modular, Meylan, France). To assess the
stability of the PCr assay along the study period, Blinded
ProBioQal controls were carried out every five weeks and a
nationwide-blinded control was carried out each year. The intra￾assay coefficient of variation was around 0.7%. The inter-assay
coefficients of variation at low (45–60 mmol/L) and high
(580 mmol/L) plasma creatinine concentrations were around 4%
and 1.5%, respectively. [13].
All PCr measurements were performed with the same method
over the whole study period. These measurements were standard￾ized by linear regression adjustment of the concentrations
obtained by the compensated Jaffe´ assay and the concentrations
obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS).
The calibration equation was: Standardized serum creati￾nine = 0.9395 * (Jaffe´ compensated serum creatinine in mmol/L)
+4.6964. The intercept (4.6964; 95% confidence interval (CI)
[22.4619 to 11.8656]) and the slope (0.9395; 95% CI [0.8719 to
1.0072]) of the calibration line were not significantly different from
0 and 1, respectively. The coefficient of correlation r was 0.97. The
mean difference between the LCMS and the compensated Jaffe´
values was 1.24610.05 mmol/L.
Measurement of GFR
The GFR was measured (mGFR) by the renal clearance of
inulin (polyfructosan infusion, Inu testH, Fresenius Kagi, Graz,
Austria). A standard technique was used by a trained staff with a
continuous infusion after a 30 mg/kg priming dose of polyfructo￾san. Water diuresis was induced by oral administration of 5 mL/
kg of water followed by 3 mL/kg every 30 minutes combined with
an intravenous infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride. Patients needing
intermittent urethral catheterization were excluded from this
study. The measurements of plasma and urine polyfructosan were
performed using the same enzymatic method (Inu testH). The
results were expressed per 1.73 m2 body surface area (Dubois
formula: BSA = height0.725 * weight0.425 * 0.007184). [14].
Statistical Analysis
Estimation of the k-coefficient of Schwartz-Lyon formula
in the French cohort. A linear mixed regression was used to
model the clearance of inulin according to the ratio of height over
PCr with an intercept fixed at zero and a random effect to take
into account the correlation between clearance measurements
made in the same patient. [15,16] A model was built for children
aged ,13 years and another for adolescents. Considering that
puberty induces the main body composition changes between boys
and girls, an interaction term between sex and the height/PCr
ratio was added to the adolescent model. A modeling of the
residual variance using a power function of the predicted mean
allowed correcting for heteroscedasticity of the residuals.
The lme function of package nlme in R software was used to fit
the model and the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method
was used to estimate the model parameters. [16].
Performance of 2009-Schwartz and Schwartz-Lyon
formulas in the French and Swedish cohorts. We assessed
the agreement first between the mGFR and the eGFR as
estimated with 2009-Schwartz formula, then between the mGFR
and the eGFR as estimated with Schwartz-Lyon formula in the
French and in the Swedish cohort.
Each mGFR-eGFR agreement was assessed using the following
tools:
1) The mean ratio = mean eGFR/mGFR to assess bias. Here,
the ratio was preferred to the difference between eGFR and
mGFR in order to correct for heteroscedasticity.
2) The standard deviation of the eGFR/mGFR ratio to assess
the heterogeneity of this ratio.
3) Bland and Altman graphs.
4) The Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) between
each eGFR and the mGFR (after logarithmic transforma￾tion of their values). The CCC is a measure of agreement
that adjusts the Pearson correlation coefficient downward
whenever there is a systematic bias between the methods
being compared. [17,18]

5) The 10% and 30% accuracies according to the KDOQI
guidelines. [2] These are defined as the proportions of the
estimates falling respectively within the interval
mGFR610% or the interval mGFR630%.
The comparisons of the eGFR mean ratios, the CCCs, and the
10 and 30% accuracies between the two formulas used,
respectively, a paired t test, the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals
of the difference between the two CCCs, and McNemar’s test.
In the French cohort, a random intercept model was used to
estimate the mean ratio and the standard deviation of the ratio.
This allowed for repeated measurements in the same patients and
estimates of intra-patient and inter-patient variances.
Bland & Altman graphs were built using the mGFR values on
the x-axis because the mGFR (i.e., clearance) is considered as the
gold standard method for GFR measurement. [19,20] In fact,
Krouwer has shown that the means of two methods being
compared should not be used on the X axis whenever one of the
methods is the gold standard, but that it is the gold standard that
should be used instead. [20].
Formula performance by CKD stage in the French
cohort. The mean eGFR/mGFR ratio, the standard deviation
of the ratio, and the 10% and 30% accuracies were assessed in
each of the three CKD stages (Stage 1: GFR .90 mL/min/1.73
m2
, Stage 2:60# GFR ,90 mL/min/1.73 m2
, Stage 3: GFR
,60 mL/min/1.73 m2
).
The ability of the formulas to distinguish between patients
without CKD and patients with different-stage CKD was
estimated using the area under the ROC curve. The Delong￾Clarke-Pearson method was used to compare the AUCs given by
the two formulas.
All the analyses were performed using R for windows version
2.13. A value of p,0.05 was considered for statistical significance.
Results
Clinical Characteristics of the French Cohort
The French cohort of children and adolescents included 360
patients of whom 53% were males. These patients contributed 965
measurements (an average of 3 mGFR and PCr measurements
per patient). In this cohort, 28% of the patients had a mGFR
,60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 1).
Estimation of the New Coefficients According to Sex and
Age
Applying a linear mixed-effects model to children ,13 years
old, we found a regression coefficient (standard error) of 32.5
(0.33).
The use of the same model in children $13 years led to a higher
coefficient in boys than in girls: the regression coefficient (standard
error) was 36.5 (0.55) in boys and 32.5 (0.74) in girls.
Performance of Schwartz-Lyon Formula in the French
Cohort
2009-Schwartz and Schwartz-Lyon formulas were applied to
the French cohort (Table 2). The performance of Schwartz-Lyon
was better than that of 2009-Schwartz (Table 3) in the whole
cohort, in children alone, and in adolescents alone. Indeed,
Schwartz-Lyon formula had a lower bias (as shown by mean ratios
and CCCs significantly closer to 1) than those with the 2009-
Schwartz formula (Table 3). The standard deviations of the ratio
were slightly lower with the Schwartz-Lyon formula and the 30%
accuracies of Schwartz-Lyon formula were significantly higher
than those of the 2009-Schwartz formula. This illustrates a better
agreement between Schwartz-Lyon formula and mGFR than
between 2009-Schwartz and mGFR (Table 3).
The two formulas underestimated the mGFR in patients with
normal renal function (Table 4). But, in patients with renal
insufficiency, the mGFR was overestimated with the 2009-
Schwartz formula and this overestimation increased along with
the severity of the disease. This overestimation was significantly
lower with Schwartz-Lyon than with 2009-Schwartz formula
(Table 4).
The abilities of the formulas to distinguish patients with renal
insufficiency from subjects with normal renal function was slightly
higher with Schwartz-Lyon formula whatever the severity of the
renal insufficiency as shown by greater areas under the ROC
curves (Table 4). The estimations of the areas under the ROC
curves were greater than 90% with the two formulas (Table 4).
External Validation on the Swedish Cohort
We applied Schwartz-Lyon formula to the Swedish cohort
(Table 1). Overall, the two equations showed similar performance
in the Swedish and the French population (Table 3).
In the Swedish population, the bias of Schwartz-Lyon formula
was significantly lower than that of 2009-Schwartz among children
(mean ratio closer to 1) (Table 3 and Figure 1). We did not find
statistically significant differences between the two formulas
regarding the 10% accuracy, the 30% accuracy, or the CCC in
the children group, probably due to the small number of patients
in this age group (41 patients ,13 years). However, Schwartz￾Lyon formula underestimated the mGFR by 8% among the
adolescents (mean eGFR/mGFR ratio of 0.92) and overestimated
it by 3% in the children whereas 2009-Schwartz formula
underestimated the mGFR by 4% in the adolescents and
overestimated it by 15% in the children (Table 3).
Bland & Altman graphs show an overestimation of the mGFR
at values under 50 mL//min/1.73 m2 for the 2009-Schwartz
formula in children (all ratios .1) (Figure 1A). This overestimation
was reduced with Schwartz-Lyon formula (Figure 1B). We did not
find significant differences between the two formulas in the
adolescents (Figure 1C and 1D).
Discussion
Chronic kidney disease and its complications cause substantial
morbidity and mortality. [21] Most patients with CKD are
identified or treated only after considerable delays and some adults
presenting with CKD may have developed early stages of CKD
during childhood or adolescence. [22,23] An early detection of
CKD is therefore essential to reduce the CKD-associated
cardiovascular morbidity and delay the progression toward end￾stage renal disease. eGFR equations facilitate detection, evalua￾tion, and management of the disease, and should result in
improved patient care and better clinical outcomes. [24].
The original Schwartz formula [10] developed in children in
1976 has been recently adapted to current methods of PCr assay
[8] and its use is now recommended to estimate GFR in children.
However, this original formula was developed in a cohort of 349
North American children with mild to severe CKD (median GFR
41 mL/min/1.73 m2
) and remarkable growth retardation and
could not take age into account, especially in adolescent boys. In a
previous study on the original Schwartz formula in a small number
of patients (n = 167), we determined new k-coefficients using a
simple regression method [25] similar to that used for the original
formula. The study led to different coefficients according to age
and sex (k= 33 for boys and girls ,13 years old and k= 37 for boys
$13 years old). These coefficients were validated in a pediatric

population of 252 patients aged 10.764.0 years (range 4.4 to 19.9)
with mild or no renal insufficiency (mean mGFR 101632 mL/
min/1.73 m2
) and no significant growth retardation. [4] Then,
taking benefit from a larger number of patients with repeated
measurements in our database, we decided to reestimate the
former k-coefficients using statistical methods that allow for
repeated measurements (linear mixed-effects models) in order to
obtain much more accurate coefficients according to children age
and improve the performance of this creatinine-based GFR
estimating equation.
The main results of the present study were: 1) a demonstration
of the interest of using different coefficients (one for children ,13
years old and female adolescents and another for male adolescents)
as previously shown by Schwartz in 1976; 2) the validation of the
new coefficients (Schwartz-Lyon formula) in another population of
patients.
A comparison between the last Schwartz formula (2009-
Schawrtz) and the present Lyon-Schwartz shows several interest￾ing differences. First, the 2009-Schwartz was developed in a cohort
of children with mild to severe CKD and notable growth
retardation [8] and no age-subgroup subdivision (as in the 1976-
formula). [26,10] The population studied here experienced mild or
no renal insufficiency (median GFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m2
) and
less than 10% of it experienced growth retardation. This led to a
Schwartz-Lyon k-coefficient close to that of the 2009- Schwartz
formula for boys .13 years old (k= 36.5), but to a lower k￾coefficient (k = 32.5) in all girls and in boys ,13. Second, the new
Schwartz-Lyon formula elaborated in a French cohort was
validated in a Swedish cohort of similar age distribution but
devoid of growth retardation and with lower renal function
(median GFR 62 mL/min/1.73 m2
). The new formula showed a
good performance with a 30% accuracy of more than 90% (which
is the lower limit recommended by the KDOQI clinical practical
guidelines) [12] and with a mean underestimation of mGFR of

about 4%. Compared to the 2009-Schwartz formula, the new
Schwartz-Lyon formula showed a better performance in the
children group (mean eGFR/mGFR ratio closer to one, p,0.05)
but equivalent performance in the adolescent group. Finally, the
30% accuracy was not significantly higher with Schwartz-Lyon
formula than in 2009-Schwartz formula probably because of the
limited number of patients in each group. We believe that the use
of a specific coefficient in children ,13 and girls $13 years of age
(who have a lower muscle mass than male adolescents) improved
slightly but significantly the performance of the formula.
Schwartz-Lyon and 2009-Schwartz formulas tended to under￾estimate the mGFR in subjects with normal renal function2 and
overestimate it in patients with renal insufficiency. Previous studies
using the 2009-Schwartz equation have shown very similar results.
Staples et al. [27] compared eGFR with mGFR using iothalamate
clearance in a population of 503 children aged 1 to 16 years with
mean mGFR of 110.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 and found a mean bias
of 25.8 and 29.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 for mGFR values below and
above 90 mL/min/1.73 m2
, respectively. These results are in
agreement with those of Pottel et al. [28] and of Fadrowski et al.
[22] who suggested that the 2009-Schwartz formula may
underestimate renal function in patients including 8.9% adoles￾cents with eGFR ,75 mL/min/1.73 m2
. Chavers et al. [29] have
also found that the CKiD formula (that included PCr, cystatin C,
and blood urea nitrogen) underestimated the renal function in
undiseased subjects.
Several strengths of the present study can be pointed out: 1) the
use of the reference standard method for GFR measurement (i.e.,
inulin clearance) both in the test and the validation population; 2)
the use of an IDMS standardized creatinine for the validation of
the coefficients; and, 3) a validation of the new coefficients in a
different population of patients (the Swedish cohort). However, the

More Accurate Schwartz Formula in Children

study present also some limitations:1) the age lower-limit for
adolescence was arbitrarily set to 13 as in Schwartz’s original study
and no objective marker of puberty was used to classify male
adolescents (e.g., Tanner stages); 2) unintentionally, the study
populations did not include non-Caucasian patients; thus, it could
not assess the effect of ethnicity; and 3) the performance of eGFR
equations in patients with mGFR ,30 mL/min/1.73 m2 could
not be assessed because of the small number of such patients in the
study population.
In conclusion, the present study validated and completed that of
Schwartz et al in 2009 with a determination and a validation of a
specific coefficient for children and female adolescents, which
improves slightly the performance of the initial formula. The good
performance and the simplicity of 2009-Schwartz and Schwartz￾Lyon formulas are strong arguments for recommending them in
routine care of children and adolescents.
