RESEARCH
Scedosporium apiospermum and S. prolifi cans are 
fungi of increasing clinical importance, particularly in per￾sons with underlying diseases. We reviewed the records 
of 59 patients in Australia from whom Scedosporium spp. 
were isolated from June 30, 1997, through December 31, 
2003. S. apiospermum was isolated predominantly from 
the respiratory tracts of 28 of 31 patients with underlying 
lung diseases and resulted in 2 infections and 1 death. The 
annual number of S. apiospermum isolates remained con￾stant. S. prolifi cans was isolated from 28 patients only after 
November 1999. Eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia 
or hematopoietic stem cell transplants had invasive infec￾tion; 4 had fungemia and 6 died from infection. S. prolifi cans
caused locally invasive infection in 2 immunocompetent pa￾tients and was found in the respiratory tract of 18 patients 
with underlying respiratory disease but did not cause funge￾mia or deaths in these patients. Scedosporium spp. showed 
distinct clinical and epidemiologic features.
Scedosporium apiospermum and S. prolifi cans are sap￾rophytic molds with a worldwide distribution. S. apio￾spermum, the anamorph of Pseudallescheria boydii, was 
described more than a century ago as a cause of Madura 
foot and subsequently mycetoma and otitis externa. Re￾cently, it has been isolated from patients with chronic 
lung disease, particularly cystic fi brosis (1,2), where the 
spectrum of infection ranges from colonization to dis￾seminated infection. S. prolifi cans was fi rst described as a 
human pathogen in 1984 (3). Scedosporium spp. cause a 
broad spectrum of diseases, including soft tissue infections 
(4–6), septic arthritis (7), osteomyelitis (8,9), ophthalmic 
infections (10–12), sinusitis (13), pneumonia (14,15), men￾ingitis and brain abscesses (16,17), endocarditis (18), and 
disseminated infection (8,18–21). Patients at risk include 
those immunocompromised because of advanced HIV in￾fection (6,18,20), immunosuppressive therapy and neutro￾penia (6,18–21), or intravenous drug use (6,20).
In the fi nal months of 1999 during construction work, 
an increased number of Scedosporium spp. isolates and S. 
prolifi cans were noted at Alfred Hospital, a university hos￾pital in Prahran, Victoria, Australia, that provides statewide 
trauma, burn, cystic fi brosis, heart and lung transplant, 
and HIV services. The records of all patients from whom 
Scedosprium spp. were isolated from June 30, 1997, 
through December 31, 2003, were reviewed to describe 
the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of these 
infections.
Methods
Data Collection
Records of all patients with Scedosporium spp. cul￾tured between June 30, 1997, and December 31, 2003, 
were reviewed retrospectively, and demographics, primary 
illness, antifungal therapy, and presence of other patho￾gens, and outcomes were recorded. Immunocompromised 
patients were defi ned as those with impairment of either or 
both natural and specifi c immunity to infection (22). Those 
with localized impaired host defenses caused by underly￾ing diseases such as cystic fi brosis were classifi ed as im￾munocompetent. Invasive infection was defi ned as a tissue 
biopsy specimen with hyphae plus culture of the organism 
(23). Disseminated infection was defi ned as positive blood 
cultures or infection at >2 noncontiguous sites within 7 
days. Neutropenia was defi ned as an absolute neutrophil 
count <0.5 cells/mm3
. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios 
were calculated by using STATA release 8.0 (Stata Corpo￾ration, College Station, TX, USA.)

 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 8, August 2007 1171 
Laboratory Methods and Epidemiology
Scedosporium spp. were identifi ed after culture onto 
horse blood agar and Sabaroud dextrose agar (SDA) and 
incubation at 30°C and 37°C. Colonies were rapid-grow￾ing, gray-white, and downy, with a gray-black reverse side. 
Species were differentiated by microscopic morphology 
(24). Susceptibility testing was performed according to 
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods (25) 
and synergy studies (2-dimensional 2-agent microdilution 
checkerboard method) (26). Synergy was a summation of 
the fractional inhibitory concentration <0.500.
For comparison of temporal patterns of mold isolates, 
the number of persons with Scedosporium spp. during the 
3 years subsequent to this review (2004–2006) and Asper￾gillus spp. for 1999–2005 were extracted from laboratory 
databases. Rates of detection were expressed as per 1,000 
separations and per 100,000 inpatient-patient days.
Environmental Sampling
From March 2001 through July 2002, environmental 
samples were collected from hospital public access areas 
within and adjacent to the construction site on 7 separate 
occasions. Additional sampling was conducted in ward 
corridors, nursing stations, patient rooms, and the patient 
car park. Air sampling was conducted with a portable high￾volume air sampler (MAS 100; Merck, Darmstadt, Germa￾ny). The volume of air sampled at each site was 1,000 L/10 
min (1 m3
). Settle plates were placed in ward corridors and 
patient rooms for 60 min of exposure. Dust was collected 
from horizontal surfaces with sterile swabs moistened with 
sterile saline. Dust and soil specimens were directly placed 
on standard SDA and selective SDA containing amphoteri￾cin B and incubated at 27°C.
Results 
From June 1997 through December 2003, a total of 59 
isolates of Scedosporium spp. were cultured from 56 pa￾tients. S. apiospermum was isolated from 31 patients, and 
S. prolifi cans was isolated from 28 patients. Both species 
were isolated from 3 patients at separate times (12 days, 13 
months, and 27 months apart, respectively). Demographic 
information, coinfections, and outcomes of the patients are 
shown according to the species isolated (Table 1). During 
the period of this review, an average of 28 allogeneic stem 
cell, 35 lung, 27 heart, and 15 renal transplants were per￾formed each year.
S. apiospermum
S. apiospermum was isolated from 32 specimens col￾lected from 31 patients. Twenty-nine isolates were from the 
respiratory tract; sputum (n = 22), bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL) (n = 5), sinus (n = 1), and lung tissue (n = 1). The 
remaining 3 isolates were from brain tissue, a central ve￾nous catheter tip, and an ear swab, respectively. No blood 
cultures were positive for S. apiospermum. S. apiospermum
was isolated concurrently with Aspergillus spp. from the 
respiratory tracts of 9 (29%) of the 31 patients.
Twenty-one (68%) of the 31 patients were immuno￾compromised. Thirteen had undergone solid organ trans￾plantation (11 had lung transplants and 2 had heart trans￾plants), 4 had malignancies (3 had metastatic cancer and 1 
had chronic lymphocytic leukemia), 3 had advanced HIV 
infection, and 1 was receiving immunosuppressive therapy 
for rheumatoid arthritis. All 10 immunocompetent patients 
had chronic respiratory tract disease; cystic fi brosis (n = 5), 
bronchiectasis (n = 4) and chronic mastoiditis (n = 1).
Three patients were lost to follow-up after isolation of 
S. apiospermum. The remaining 28 patients were followed 
up for a total of 981 months. The mean duration of follow￾up was 35 months (median 16 months, range 1–96 months). 
Two (6%) of the 31 patients had invasive infections. The 
fi rst patient was a woman who received a lung transplant 5 
years earlier and was previously colonized with Aspergil￾lus spp. but not S. apiospermum. She had pulmonary and 
cerebral lesions and was treated with amphotericin B de￾oxycholate and itraconazole for presumed aspergillosis. S. 
apiospermum was isolated from postmortem lung and brain 
tissue. The second patient was a man who had advanced 
HIV infection with fungal sinusitis on biopsy. He was treat￾ed with voriconazole and surgery but died 3 months later 
from infection with cytomegalovirus. There were 6 deaths 
within 1 month of isolation of S. apiospermum. All deaths 
occurred in immunocompromised patients but only 1 was 
directly attributable to S. apiospermum. The other deaths 
resulted from the underlying condition.
Four patients with chronic lung disease were receiv￾ing itraconazole for treatment of Aspergillus spp. infection 
at the time S. apiospermum was isolated. Three of these 
patients died of respiratory failure 7, 9, and 16 months, re￾spectively, after isolation of S. apiospermum, and 1 was 
alive when last seen 96 months after fungal isolation. 
Seven patients received antifungal therapy after isolation 
of S. apiospermum from respiratory tract samples (4 re￾ceived voriconazole and 3 received itraconazole). These 7 
patients had HIV infection and sinusitis (n = 2), had un￾dergone lung transplantation (n = 3) or had bronchiectasis 
or cystic fi brosis (n = 2). Both patients with HIV infection 
had sinusitis and died within 7 months of complications of 
HIV. Of the other 5 patients, 4 who received azole therapy 
remained well without invasive infection at 32, 41, 48, and 
88 months, respectively, of follow-up. The remaining treat￾ed patient died 15 months later; death was not attributed to 
fungal infection. The median duration of follow-up of those 
treated with azoles at the time of fungal isolation or sub￾sequent to isolation was 16 months (range 3–96 months); 
S. apiospermum was not subsequently detected in these

patients. The median duration of follow-up for patients re￾ceiving no treatment after fungal isolation was 19 months 
(range 1–84 months); S. apiospermum was isolated from 
4 of these patients 1, 18, 30, and 36 months, respectively, 
after initial fungal isolation.
S. prolifi cans
S. prolifi cans was isolated from 46 specimens obtained 
from 28 patients. Fourteen (50%) of the 28 patients were 
immunocompetent. Most (12/14, [86%]) specimens from 
immunocompetent patients were from the respiratory tract; 
cystic fi brosis (n = 6), chronic airway disease (n = 3), na￾sal discharge and sinus aspirates with chronic sinusitis (n = 
3). Patients with cystic fi brosis or airway disease were not 
considered to have invasive disease and none received an￾tifungal therapy. All 3 patients with chronic sinusitis were 
treated with surgery, and 2 received itraconazole. One iso￾late was from knee cartilage of a patient with hemophilia, 
osteoarthritis, and a knee replacement; the patient under￾went surgery and received itraconazole. S. prolifi cans was 
also isolated from a skin-biopsy specimen from a patient 
with multiple-trauma and cellulitis who was treated only 
with surgery. There were no cases of disseminated infec￾tion or deaths resulting from S. prolifi cans in these immu￾nocompetent patients.
S. prolifi cans was isolated from 14 immunocompro￾mised patients. Immunodefi ciency was caused by lung 
transplantation (n = 6), hematopoietic stem cell transplan￾tation (HSCT) (n = 6), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). S. prolifi cans was iso￾lated from BAL of 6 lung transplant recipients. One patient 
was receiving itraconazole for Aspergillus spp. infection, 3 
were receiving voriconazole, and 2 were receiving itracon￾azole and voriconazole with terbinafi ne. Invasive disease 
did not develop in any of the 4 lung transplant recipients 
who received antifungal treatment and none died. Two lung 
transplant recipients did not receive antifungal treatment. 
One of these patients was lost to follow-up and 1 survived 
>25 months without developing invasive infection, al￾though S. prolifi cans was isolated again 1 year later.

S. prolifi cans was isolated from August 2000 through 
September 2002 from 6 patients undergoing allogeneic 
HSCT and from 2 patients with hematologic malignancy. 
Four of the 6 HSCT recipients had positive blood cultures, 
and 4 recipients had skin lesions (multiple, nodular). Find￾ings for 8 patients in whom invasive disease developed are 
summarized in Table 2. 
Patients 1, 2, and 6 had HSCT complicated by chronic 
extensive refractory graft versus host disease (GVHD). All 
3 died of invasive infection despite treatment with itracon￾azole or voriconazole and terbinafi ne; 2 had positive blood 
cultures. Infections developed in patients 3, 4, and 5 during 
neutropenia after HSCT. Two of them had positive blood 
cultures, and both died. Patient 4 received no antifungal 
treatment, and patient 5 died despite replacement of pro￾phylactic itraconazole with empiric amphotericin B. Patient 
3, described elsewhere (8), survived after treatment with 
voriconazole, terbinafi ne, surgery, and neutrophil recovery. 
Patient 7 had MDS and preceding idiopathic CD4-cell lym￾phocytopenia. S. prolifi cans was isolated from sputum, but 
not BAL, and this patient was not treated. One month later, 
S. prolifi cans sinusitis was diagnosed. Despite surgery and 
treatment with itraconazole, followed by voriconazole and 
terbinafi ne, the patient died. Patient 8, a woman, was neu￾tropenic after remission-induction chemotherapy for AML. 
A swab from a Hickman catheter exit site was positive for 
S. prolifi cans. Subsequently, chest wall cellulitis, deep soft 
tissue infection, and multiple skin nodules developed. She 
was treated with surgery, voriconazole, and terbinafi ne. 
Her neutropenia resolved and she recovered.
After isolation of S. prolifi cans, 5 of 28 patients were 
lost to follow-up. The remaining 23 were followed up for 
a total of 517 months. Mean length of follow-up was 22.5 
months (median 9 months, range 1–68 months). Invasive 
infection occurred in 10 (36%) of 28 infected with S. prolifi -
cans compared with 2 (6%) of 31 infected with S. apiosper￾mum. Deaths caused by scedosporiosis occurred in 5 (18%) 
of 28 infected with S. prolifi cans and 1 (3%) of 31 infected 
with S. apiospermum. All deaths occurred in immunocom￾promised patients; 6 (43%) of 14 infected with S. prolifi cans
and 1 (5%) of 21 infected with S. apiospermum (odds ratio 
6.0, 95% confi dence interval 0.78–45.62, p = 0.05).
Drug-Susceptibility Testing
Drug-susceptibility testing was performed on 7 S. 
prolifi cans isolates. MICs (mg/L) were >16 for ampho￾tericin B, >64 for fl uconazole, >8 for itraconazole, >64 
for 5-fl uorocytosine, and >16 for ketoconazole, 2–8 for 
voriconazole, and 1–4 for terbinafi ne. Terbinafi ne and 
itraconazole were synergistic for 3 of 6 isolates tested, 
and terbinafi ne and voriconazole were synergistic for 5 
of 7 isolates tested. Four S. apiospermum isolates tested

Epidemiology of Scedosporium spp. 
and Aspergillus spp.
Throughout the study, S. apiospermum was isolated at 
a constant rate (Figure) of 3–6 isolates per year with no 
seasonal clustering. In contrast, S. prolifi cans was fi rst de￾tected in December 1999, and thereafter ≈8 isolates were 
identifi ed annually. Detection of S. prolifi cans continued 
in 2004 with 8 isolates but decreased to 6 in 2005 and 4 in 
2006. Two clusters of infection occurred in autumn 2001 
and 2003 during periods of hospital building that required 
deep excavation. Air, dust, and soil sampling did not de￾tect an environmental fungal source. Aspergillus spp. were 
detected during 1999–2005 (mean 191 persons per year, 
range 153–230). Detection rates for Scedosporium spp. 
and Aspergillus spp. for 2003–2005 were 0.1–0.23/1,000 
separations and 2–3/100,000 inpatient-patient days and 
2.4–3.0/1,000 separations and 53–75/100,000 inpatient-pa￾tient days, respectively.
Discussion
This study describes the epidemiology of Scedospo￾rium infection in a cohort of contemporaneous patients at a 
university hospital. The single-center approach, with cases 
identifi ed by laboratory detection, allows capture of the full 
spectrum of infection from colonization to invasive infec￾tion. Scedosporium spp. were detected in a broad range of 
patients and clinical settings. However, there were distinct 
differences in epidemiology, clinical manifestations, an￾tifungal susceptibility patterns, and outcomes between S. 
prolifi cans and S. apiospermum.
Previous reviews have focused on invasive cases re￾ported (10,27,28), but this approach is limited by both se￾lection and publication bias (29) and does not describe the 
natural history of infection or the prevalence of these infec￾tions. Our series enables the annual incidence of cases, ra￾tio of colonized to infected patients, and natural history of 
colonization to be determined for each species. We showed 
that invasive infections accounted for only 6% of S. ap￾iospermum isolates and for 46% of S. prolifi cans isolates, 
and that isolation of Aspergillus spp. was 20–30 times more 
frequent than that of Scedosporium spp.
S. apiospermum and S. prolifi cans are colonizers of 
abnormal airways caused by bronchiectasis, cystic fi brosis, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or lung transplanta￾tion (1,2,6,18,30,31). S. apiospermum was an airway colo￾nizer in <10% of patients with cystic fi brosis in France and 
Australia (1,2), and similar proportions of lung transplant 
recipients were colonized with 1 or both species at 1 cen￾ter in Australia (31). However, there are few reports that 
S. prolifi cans colonized patients with lung disease (6,32). 
In the present study, S. prolifi cans was identifi ed as an 
airway colonizer only after December 1999. The onset of 
invasive infections in HSCT and neutropenic patients oc￾curred in August 2000. S. prolifi cans was fi rst detected at 
the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, after 
2001 (19). Emergence of S. prolifi cans may be related to 
an environmental source that was not identifi ed or selec￾tion pressure caused by changes in antifungal prophylaxis 
practices (33). This fi nding did not appear to be the expla￾nation in our patients because fl uconazole remains standard 
prophylaxis for neutropenia, and itraconazole was used in 
only 1 of 8 patients. Other possible explanations include 
use of more aggressive chemotherapy regimens in patients 
with acute leukemia and the advent of nonmyeloablative 
allografts, which change characteristics of patients selected 
for transplants. The reason for persistence of this organism 
over several years after its initial appearance is also unclear 
but has also been observed by others (19).

Infection with Scedosporium spp., Australia
 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 8, August 2007 1175 
In patients with respiratory tract disease, both Scedo￾sporium spp. were isolated in comparable numbers. How￾ever, the only invasive infection in this diverse group was 
disseminated S. apiospermum 5 years after lung transplan￾tion. The outcome of 19 patients who had undergone lung 
or heart lung transplantation and were colonized with this 
fungus was comparable to the 17 patients in the immuno￾competent group with airways disease caused by cystic 
fi brosis, bronchiectasis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. As in other reports, other opportunistic pathogens, 
especially Aspergillus spp. (present in one third), were 
commonly cultured simultaneously (1,18,30,31). In lung 
transplant recipients, Scedosporium spp. in BAL was as￾sociated with advanced bronchiolitis obliterans and airway 
stenosis (31), which emphasizes the diffi culty of interpret￾ing the role of Scedosporium spp. in this group. Whether 
colonization follows airway damage, immunosuppression, 
or antifungal therapy to treat Aspergillus spp. coloniza￾tion or is itself an ongoing cause of airway damage such 
as bronchiolitis obliterans is unknown. In our study group, 
most patients with respiratory tract colonization had not re￾ceived antifungal therapy. Although antifungal treatment 
was used in ≈50% of patients with S. apiospermum airway 
colonization, there appeared to be no survival advantage in 
patients treated; our study was not a randomized compari￾son. With S. prolifi cans respiratory tract colonization, too 
few patients were treated with antifungal drugs for valid 
conclusions to be made. There was no reduction in survival 
in 5 untreated patients with isolates of either S. apiosper￾mum or S. prolifi cans. The role of Scedosporium spp. respi￾ratory tract colonization requires further evaluation.
Allogeneic HSCT and AML/MDS were the only settings 
in which S. prolifi cans was more common than S. apiosper￾mum. There were no S. apiospermum infections in these 
patients, although in at 1 US cancer center, S. apiosper￾mum infections were more common (19). This may refl ect 
different geographic distributions of Scedosporium spp. In 
our study, S. prolifi cans caused illness with high mortality 
rates in HSCT and leukemia patients. In HSCT recipients, 
S. prolifi cans infections occurred equally in those with 
neutropenia (early after transplant) and GVHD (later after 
transplant). Thus, host factors unique to AML and HSCT, 
such as neutropenia, GVHD, associated macrophage dys￾function, and environmental exposure, may play a role in 
the propensity for invasive infection with S. prolifi cans in 
this group.
As in previous reports (10,32), neutropenic patients 
had sepsis, positive blood cultures, and overwhelming in￾fection (often associated with disseminated rash). In non￾neutropenic patients, infection was more likely to be local￾ized initially in lungs, joints, or sinuses. The ability of S. 
prolifi cans to grow in blood cultures in AML and HSCT 
patients is well recognized (10,34), and this diagnosis, or 
infection with Fusarium spp., should be considered when 
a mold is cultured from blood. In our study, S. prolifi cans
was the only species to grow in blood culture, although oth￾ers have reported S. apiospermum, albeit, less frequently 
(10,18,19). Although colonization with S. prolifi cans with￾out progression to disease was observed in patients with 
respiratory disease and after lung transplantation, this was 
not observed in 3 patients with AML/MDS or HSCT. A 
nonsterile site swab or sputum culture yielding S. prolifi -
cans was soon followed by a diagnosis of invasive infec￾tion, which indicated that in these patients a culture result, 
even from a nonsterile site, should be viewed seriously.
The clinical fi ndings of S. prolifi cans in our patients 
suggest that this fungus is more invasive than S. apiosper￾mum, as has been found in mice (35). In addition to dissem￾inated infection in AML patients and HSCT recipients, S. 
prolifi cans also caused locally invasive disease in patients 
who were not immunocompromised, such as those with 
posttrauma cellulitis, septic arthritis in a damaged joint, 
and sinus disease. One proposed mechanism for virulence 
of S. prolifi cans is melanin in the cell wall (27).
Antifungal therapy is problematic with S. prolifi cans
with high MICs for amphotericin B, echinocandins, and 
azoles. This fi nding has stimulated interest in combinations 
of voriconazole and terbinafi ne (26), voriconazole and echi￾nocandin (36), or polyene and echinocandin (36). However, 
these infections are rare and experience is limited to case 
reports (8,9,36). In vitro treatment with interferon-γ and 
granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor has 
improved neutrophil function against S. prolifi cans hyphae 
(37). Surgery appears to be an important factor in survival 
in our cases, as well as other series (10). Although surgery 
and antifungal therapy were successful in 2 neutropenic 
patients with invasive S. prolifi cans infections, these pa￾tients also had concomitant neutrophil recovery that could 
explain their survival.
Much needs to be learned about the epidemiology, 
transmission, pathogenesis, and environmental niche of 
Scedosporium spp., especially S. prolifi cans. A source for 
emergence of S. prolifi cans at our hospital was investigated, 
but none was identifi ed. Our inability to detect the source 
of emergent S. prolifi cans was puzzling, although exposure 
and colonization may have occurred by the time the fi rst 
case was seen. Cultures may have been obtained too late 
to identify environmental contamination, although changes 
in immunosuppression in the population at risk may also 
have contributed. S. prolifi cans appeared fi rst as a colonizer 
of abnormal airways 8 months before the fi rst invasive in￾fection in an HSCT recipient. Shifts in the epidemiology 
of colonizing organisms in this patient group during hos￾pital construction may be worthy of closer attention and 
surveillance. Molecular typing methods such as PCR (38) 
and inter-simple sequence repeat PCR fi ngerprinting (39)

have distinguished genotypes from outbreaks and different 
geographic regions. Recently, S. apiospermum complex 
has been shown to include several individual species in￾distinguishable morphologically (40). These methods will 
be used for further investigation of our isolates as part of a 
larger Australian surveillance study.
In conclusion, S. prolifi cans and S. apiospermum are 
pathogenic fungi that demonstrate distinct clinical features 
dependent on the immune function of the host and the type 
of species isolated. They are usually found in patients with 
underlying disease, although occasionally after trauma. 
S. prolifi cans emerged as a major pathogen in allogeneic 
HSCT recipients and as a colonizer of patients with under￾lying lung disease. Madura foot is now rare and was not 
observed in this series. The high attributable mortality rate 
of invasive infection with both Scedosporium spp., limita￾tions of antifungal therapy, necessity for aggressive and de￾forming surgery to treat infections with S. prolifi cans, and 
uncertainty over the role of airway colonization emphasize 
the need to better understand the epidemiology and patho￾genesis of this infection.
