Abstract
Introduction: There are few studies on long-term mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute
kidney injury (AKI). We assessed the prevalence of AKI at ICU admission, its impact on mortality during one year of
follow-up, and whether the influence of AKI varied in subgroups of ICU patients.
Methods: We identified all adults admitted to any ICU in Northern Denmark (approximately 1.15 million
inhabitants) from 2005 through 2010 using population-based medical registries. AKI was defined at ICU admission
based on the risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function, and end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classification, using
plasma creatinine changes. We included four severity levels: AKI-risk, AKI-injury, AKI-failure, and without AKI. We
estimated cumulative mortality by the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratios (HRs) using a Cox model adjusted
for potential confounders. We computed estimates for all ICU patients and for subgroups with different
comorbidity levels, chronic kidney disease status, surgical status, primary hospital diagnosis, and treatment with
mechanical ventilation or with inotropes/vasopressors.
Results: We identified 30,762 ICU patients, of which 4,793 (15.6%) had AKI at ICU admission. Thirty-day mortality
was 35.5% for the AKI-risk group, 44.2% for the AKI-injury group, and 41.0% for the AKI-failure group, compared
with 12.8% for patients without AKI. The corresponding adjusted HRs were 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-
2.13), 2.60 (95% CI 2.38 to 2.85) and 2.41 (95% CI 2.21 to 2.64), compared to patients without AKI. Among patients
surviving 30 days (n = 25,539), 31- to 365 day mortality was 20.5% for the AKI-risk group, 23.8% for the AKI-injury
group, and 23.2% for the AKI-failure group, compared with 10.7% for patients without AKI, corresponding to
adjusted HRs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.51), 1.60 (95% CI 1.37 to1.87), and 1.64 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.90), respectively.
The association between AKI and 30-day mortality was evident in subgroups of the ICU population, with
associations persisting in most subgroups during the 31- to 365-day follow-up period, although to a lesser extent
than for the 30-day period.
Conclusions: AKI at ICU admission is an important prognostic factor for mortality throughout the subsequent year.
Introduction
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is defined as an abrupt
decline of kidney function, primarily described in recent
years using the widely accepted risk, injury, failure, loss
of kidney function, and end-stage kidney disease
(RIFLE) classification based on changes in serum creati￾nine level and/or urine output [1,2].
Former studies have reported a prevalence of AKI at
ICU admission between 22% and 36% [3-5]. It is
associated with 1.4- to 3.2-fold increased in-hospital
mortality compared with ICU patients without AKI,
depending on the ICU study population and AKI sever￾ity [4,5]. ICU studies of the association between maxi￾mum AKI level during ICU or hospital stay and hospital
mortality have shown similar results [3,6,7]. To date
only four ICU studies, with sample sizes from 183 to
10,518 ICU patients with or without AKI, have exam￾ined the association between AKI defined by the RIFLE
criteria and mortality beyond 90 days [8-11]. These stu￾dies have a number of limitations, including patient
recruitment at a single center [8-11], inclusion of
selected subpopulations of ICU patients (surgical or

septic ICU patients) [9-11], lack of adjustment for con￾founders [8], and loss to follow-up [11].
A large study within a population-based hospital set￾ting with complete history of preadmission comorbidity
and complete follow-up is needed to quantify the impact
of AKI on long-term mortality, including differential
impacts in subgroups of the heterogeneous ICU popula￾tion. Such information would improve understanding of
the clinical course of AKI and identify potentially pre￾ventable post-discharge deaths.
We therefore conducted a cohort study to (1) examine
the prevalence of AKI at ICU admission, (2) examine its
impact on mortality during one year of follow-up, and
(3) examine whether the influence of AKI varied in sub￾groups of ICU patients with different comorbidity levels,
chronic kidney disease status, surgical status, primary
hospital diagnosis, and treatment with mechanical venti￾lation, or inotropes/vasopressors.
Materials and methods
Setting
We conducted this cohort study using prospectively col￾lected data from medical and administrative registries in
Northern Denmark (the former counties of Aarhus and
North Jutland, with approximately 1.15 million inhabi￾tants) from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. The
Danish National Health Service provides tax-supported
health care to all Danish residents, with universal access
to public hospitals and general practitioners. All inten￾sive care in Denmark is provided at these public hospi￾tals. The unique 10-digit civil registration number
assigned to all Danish residents since 1968 permits
unambiguous linkage between medical databases [12].
Nearly all medical treatments, except very few highly
specialized treatments (for example, liver transplantation
and lung transplantation) are provided in the study
region, which has twelve ICUs, eight at university hospi￾tals and four at regional hospitals.
ICU patients
We identified all adult residents (aged 15 years or older)
with a first-time ICU admission from 1 January 2005 to
31 December 2010 using the Danish National Registry
of Patients (DNRP) [13]. We required one-year resi￾dency in the study region before the index hospitaliza￾tion to ensure availability of data on previous laboratory
measurements from the laboratory database. It is man￾datory for hospitals in Denmark to electronically report
information on all hospital contacts to the DNRP. The
DNRP includes data from non-psychiatric hospital
admissions since 1977. Since 1995, the registry has also
covered all emergency room and outpatient clinic visits.
Data in the registry include civil registration numbers,
emergency vs. planned hospital admission, dates of
hospital admission and discharge, hospital and depart￾ment, surgical procedures and major treatments per￾formed, one primary discharge diagnosis (main reason
for hospitalization) and up to 19 secondary discharge
diagnoses. Since 1994, diagnoses have been coded using
the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision
(ICD-10) [14]. Information on ICU admissions and
major treatments during the ICU stay, such as mechani￾cal ventilation, acute renal replacement therapy, and
treatment with inotropes/vasopressors, have been
coded in the DNRP with a high degree of accuracy since
2005 [13].
We used the primary ICD-10 diagnosis for the current
hospitalization to classify patients into nine disease cate￾gories as a proxy for reason for ICU admission, which is
not recorded in the DNRP. In addition, we specified five
types of ICU admission: non-surgical, elective non-car￾diac surgical, elective cardiac surgical, acute non-cardiac
surgical and acute cardiac surgical. We used the Nordic
Medico-Statistical Committee classification of surgical
procedures in the DNRP to classify patients as cardiac
and non-cardiac surgical based on whether they had any
surgical procedure and on type of surgical procedure up
to 7 days before or on the day of ICU admission,
respectively [15]. Surgical ICU patients were further
divided into acute or elective, according to the hospital
admission type registered in the DNRP. Admission type
is recorded with high accuracy in the DNRP [14].
Acute kidney injury
The laboratory database covering the study area con￾tains laboratory tests from all inpatient stays, outpatient
clinic visits, and visits to general practitioners [16]. We
searched the laboratory database for the highest mea￾surement of plasma creatinine, which is equivalent to
serum creatinine [17], on the day of ICU admission. For
patients with missing values on that day, we calculated
the mean of the highest creatinine measurements avail￾able on the day before and the day after ICU admission
[18]. We used the creatinine level to classify each
patient into one of three AKI severity levels based on
the RIFLE criteria: AKI-risk defined as a 50% to 100%
increase in creatinine from the baseline level, AKI-injury
defined as a 100% to 200% increase, and AKI-failure
defined as an increase of 200% or more or creatinine
values ≥ 354 μmol/l, with an acute rise > 44 μmol/l up
to seven days before ICU admission [1]. All other ICU
patients were classified as without AKI. Baseline creati￾nine was defined as the most recent creatinine measure￾ment from an outpatient clinic or general practitioner in
the period from one year to seven days before the cur￾rent hospitalization [19]. Creatinine assessments up to
seven days before the current hospitalization were not
considered, because the AKI process may have started

before hospital admission. For patients lacking a mea￾sured baseline creatinine level and without chronic kid￾ney disease (CKD), we estimated baseline creatinine
using the four-variable version of the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation based on age,
race, and gender assuming a normal glomerular filtra￾tion rate (GFR) of 75 ml/min, as suggested in the RIFLE
criteria [1]. We assumed that all patients were Cauca￾sians. Patients receiving chronic dialysis treatment, those
with a previous kidney transplant, and those lacking
information on creatinine level on the day of ICU
admission, and on the day before and the day after
admission were excluded from the study.
Covariates
We obtained data on preexisting comorbidity based on
inpatient and outpatient diagnoses five years before the
current hospitalization and used these to compute the
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores [20]. Patients
were categorized as having low (score = 0), medium
(score 1 to 2) and high (score ≥ 3) levels of comorbidity
[21,22]. Kidney diseases were excluded from the CCI
and addressed separately because the exposure under
study was kidney dysfunction. CKD was included as a
covariate, defined as an estimated GFR (eGFR) below 60
ml/min per 1.73 m2 using the four-variable MDRD
equation (stage 3 or higher CKD according to National
Kidney Foundation guidelines) [23]. We used the most
recent plasma creatinine measurement from an outpati￾ent clinic or general practitioner one year to seven days
before the current hospitalization to compute eGFR
[19]. In addition, we also computed the length of the
entire hospital stay, including continuous hospitaliza￾tions with inter-hospital transfer. All relevant codes are
provided in Additional file 1.
Follow-up for mortality
Deaths and migration were identified from the Danish
Civil Registration System through 31 December 2011.
This registration system is updated daily and contains
complete information since 1968 on migration, vital sta￾tus, and the exact date of death (when relevant) for all
Danish citizens [24].
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics, including demographic character￾istics, preexisting comorbidity level, and information
from the current hospitalization, were tabulated by
RIFLE group.
We followed patients from ICU admission until death
or emigration, or for up to one year, whichever came
first. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute
mortality function curves (1 - survival function) and to
estimate cumulative mortality for three time periods:
0 to 30 days, 31 to 365 days, and 0 to 365 days follow￾ing ICU admission. We computed hazard ratios (HRs)
within 0- to 30-day and 31- to 365-day periods using
Cox proportional hazards regression, controlling for age,
gender, CKD, CCI level, and surgical status. The
assumption of proportional hazards was checked graphi￾cally using log(-log(survival probability)) plots and was
found appropriate.
To examine potentially differing effects of AKI on
mortality in subgroups of ICU patients (effect measure
modification) [25], we stratified the analyses by age
groups, CCI levels, surgical status, CKD, primary hospi￾tal diagnosis, and treatment with mechanical ventilation
or inotropes/vasopressors. In these subgroup analyses
we combined patients with any degree of AKI into one
group.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the
potential influence of excluding patients lacking a creati￾nine measurement at ICU admission. In this analysis we
estimated AKI levels for patients with missing creatinine
using multiple imputations [26-28], generating five
imputed datasets. HRs were calculated as the average
HRs of the five datasets, corrected for between- and
within-imputation variation [26-28]. The imputation
model included all measured covariates in Table 1, the
outcome, and the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumu￾lative baseline hazard evaluated at the observed survival
time [29].
Analyses were performed using the statistical software
package Stata version 11.0 (StataCorp LP, College Sta￾tion; TX, USA). All data were obtained from Danish
registries, which are generally available to researchers,
and their use does not require ethical approval or
informed consent. The study was approved by the
Danish Data Protection Agency (record number 2009-
41-3987).
Results
Descriptive data
The study population comprised 30,762 adults admitted
to an ICU in Northern Denmark during the six-year
observation period, after excluding 192 (0.6%) patients
receiving chronic dialysis or with a previous kidney
transplant, and 1,578 (4.9%) patients lacking information
on plasma creatinine level at ICU admission. Patients
without a creatinine measurement were younger and
had less preexisting comorbidity and shorter hospital
stays compared with patients with a creatinine measure￾ment (Additional file 2). The total time of follow up was
23,850 person years (median duration 365 days, inter￾quartile range 258 to 365).
The median age in the study population was 65 years
and 13,352 (43%) patients were female. At ICU admission,
4,793 (15.6%) patients had AKI; these included 1,986

(6.5%) patients with AKI-risk, 1,311 (4.3%) with AKI￾injury, and 1,496 (4.9%) with AKI-failure. Preadmission
baseline plasma creatinine results were available for 21,028
(68.4%) patients, and were estimated using the MDRD
equation for the remaining 9,734 (31.6%) patients.
Patients with AKI were older and had more preexist￾ing comorbidity, including CKD, than other ICU
patients (Table 1). The most frequent diagnoses among
AKI patients were other infectious disease, gastrointest￾inal or liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. AKI was

less frequent in elective surgical patients (cardiac and
non-cardiac) compared with both non-surgical and
acute surgical patients (cardiac and non-cardiac). In
addition, patients with AKI were more often treated
with mechanical ventilation, inotropes/vasopressors, and
as expected, with dialysis during their ICU stay com￾pared to patients without AKI (patients without AKI
1.9%, patients with AKI-risk 10.4%, patients with AKI￾injury 16.8%, and patients with AKI-failure 37.5%)
(Table 1).
During the time between ICU admission and hospital
discharge (median duration 8 days, interquartile range 3
to 17), another 3,099 (10.1%) patients developed AKI.
Mortality
The one-year mortality was 48.7% (95% confidence
interval (CI) 46.5% to 50.9%) for the AKI-risk group,
57.4% (95% CI 54.8% to 60.1%) for the AKI-injury group
and 54.7% (95% CI 52.1% to 57.2%) for the AKI-failure
group, compared with 22.1% (95% CI 21.6% to 22.7%)
for the patients without AKI (Figure 1).
Overall 0- to 30-day mortality
Thirty-day mortality was 35.5% (95% CI 33.4% to 37.6%)
for the AKI-risk group, 44.2% (95% CI 41.5% to 46.9%)
for the AKI-injury group, and 41.0% (95% CI 38.5% to
43.5%) for the AKI-failure group, compared with 12.8%
(95% CI 12.4% to 13.2%) for patients without AKI. This
corresponded to adjusted HRs of 1.96 (95% CI 1.80 to
2.13), 2.60 (95% CI 2.38 to 2.85), and 2.41 (95% CI 2.21
to 2.64), respectively, all compared with ICU patients
without AKI (Table 2).
Overall 31- to 365-day mortalitys
Among patients surviving 30 days (n = 25,539), mortal￾ity between 31 days and 365 days was 20.5% (95% CI
18.4% to 22.8%) for the AKI-risk group, 23.8% (95% CI
20.9% to 27.0%) for the AKI-injury group, and 23.2%
(95% CI 20.6% to 26.1%) for the AKI-failure group com￾pared with 10.7% (95% CI 10.3% to 11.1%) for patients
without AKI. The adjusted HRs were 1.33 (95% CI 1.17
to 1.51), 1.60 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.87), and 1.64 (95% CI
1.42 to 1.90), respectively, compared with ICU patients
without AKI (Table 2).
Subgroup analyses
The association between AKI and 30-day mortality was
evident in all subgroups of the ICU population (Table
3). The relative impact of AKI was most pronounced in
patients aged 15 to 40 years; the mortality of patients
without AKI in this subgroup was 2.5%, compared to
16.8% for patients with any degree of AKI. This corre￾sponds to an adjusted HR of 4.87 (95% CI 3.33 to 7.13)
(Table 3). The relative impact of AKI was also more
pronounced among both elective cardiac and non-car￾diac surgical patients and among acute cardiac surgical
patients, with adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of 3.76 (1.62 to
8.77), 3.43 (2.65 to 4.45), and 3.27 (2.48 to 4.31), respec￾tively, and among patients with low CCI scores
(adjusted HR 2.55, 95% CI 2.31 to 2.81), due to a low
baseline hazard. By diagnostic category, the adjusted

HRs ranged from 1.53 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.96) among
patients with a primary registry diagnosis of septicemia
to 2.54 (95% CI 2.20 to 2.93) for patients with a primary
diagnosis of gastrointestinal or liver disease and 2.59
(95% CI 2.12 to 3.16) for cancer patients. The associa￾tion between AKI and 30-day mortality was also evident
in patients treated with mechanical ventilation (adjusted
HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.72) or inotropes/vasopressors
(adjusted HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.63 to 1.91) and in patients
with CKD (adjusted HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.02).
After 30 days of follow-up, AKI still was associated
with increased mortality in most subgroups, although to
a less pronounced degree than in the 30-day period
after ICU admission (Table 4).
Sensitivity analysis
The associations between AKI and mortality were simi￾lar after imputation of missing creatinine measurement
at ICU admission. The adjusted 30-day HRs were 1.95
(95% CI 1.80 to 2.12) for the AKI-risk group, 2.62 (95%
CI 2.39 to 2.86) for the AKI-injury group and 2.42 (95%
CI 2.22 to 2.64) for the AKI-failure group. In the period
31 to 365 days following ICU admission, the adjusted
HRs were 1.36 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.54), 1.61 (95% CI 1.38
to 1.88), 1.66 (95% CI 1.43 to 1.92) for the AKI-risk,
AKI-injury, and AKI-failure groups, respectively.
Discussion
In this large cohort study conducted within a popula￾tion-based hospital setting, we found that 15% of ICU
patients had AKI at ICU admission. AKI at ICU admis￾sion was associated with a two-fold increased 30-day
mortality for patients in the AKI-risk group and two￾and-a-half-fold increased 30-day mortality in the AKI￾injury and AKI-failure groups. Relative mortality in AKI
patients remained elevated, with 33% to 64% increased
mortality during the 31- to 365-day period following
ICU admission. The relative impact of AKI on 30-day
mortality was most pronounced in younger age groups
and among elective surgical and acute cardiac surgical
ICU patients.
Existing studies
Our study extends current knowledge by providing
complete one-year mortality information and by exam￾ining the differential impact of AKI on mortality in sub￾groups of the ICU population in a population-based
setting.
Previous studies reported a higher prevalence of
RIFLE-defined AKI at the time of ICU admission (22%
to 36%) compared to our findings [3-5]. This may
stem from heterogeneity in study cohorts and from
estimation of baseline creatinine by assuming GFR of
75 ml/min in cohorts including patients with CKD
[4,5], which may overestimate the prevalence of AKI
[30].
In accordance with our findings of increased short￾term mortality, five recent large studies with between
5,000 and 120,000 ICU patients all reported increased
in-hospital mortality among patients with RIFLE-defined
AKI at ICU admission or during an ICU stay, compared
with ICU patients without AKI [3-7]. In these studies,
relative risk of in-hospital mortality ranged from 1.0 to
1.6 among patients with AKI-risk, from 1.4 to 4.0
among patients with AKI-injury, and from 1.6 to 4.1
among patients with AKI-failure.
None of these studies included follow-up after hospital
discharge. Similar to our results, two studies found that
the impact of AKI on short-term mortality was similar
in the AKI-injury and AKI-failure groups [6,7]. The var￾iation found in the relative impact of AKI on short-term
mortality in our study vs. and among previous studies
may be explained by the heterogeneity of study cohorts,
use of estimated vs. measured baseline creatinine levels,
examination of the most advanced AKI stage during an
ICU stay vs. AKI level at ICU admission, availability of

data on urine output for the RIFLE classification, differ￾ent approaches to adjusting for potential confounders,
and examination of in-hospital mortality compared to
mortality at 30 days or another fixed time point [30-32].
None of the five large earlier studies reported results
from subgroups of the ICU population [3-7].
To our knowledge, only four studies have examined
the association of AKI defined by the RIFLE criteria and
long-term mortality (beyond 90 days) in ICU patients.
All were single center studies [8-11]. These studies also
observed increased long-term mortality among ICU
patients with AKI compared with patients without AKI.
Our finding of increased 30- to 365-day mortality
among both acute and elective surgical ICU patients is
in line with the work of Bihorac et al. who examined a
cohort of 10,518 elective and acute surgical ICU patients
discharged from an American hospital [9]. They
reported the following 10-year adjusted HRs after hospi￾talization: 1.18 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.29) for patients with
AKI-risk, 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.59) for patients with
AKI-injury, and 1.57 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.75) for patients
with AKI-failure, compared to patients without AKI [9].

They reported similar relative estimates in a study
restricted to elective and acute cardiothoracic surgical
ICU patients [10]. The slight difference between the
results from these two studies and our results may pri￾marily be a result of a different composition of elective
and acute surgery as well as type of surgical procedures
in the cohorts of ICU patients. A Spanish study of 234
ICU patients with sepsis who survived to hospital dis￾charge, found a relative risk of two-year mortality of 3.2
(95% CI 1.6 to 6.5) in patients with AKI during the ICU
stay compared to patients without AKI. However, data
on mortality were not available for 23% of the initial
cohort [11], and may not be directly comparable with
our subgroup of patients with a primary hospital diag￾nosis of septicemia in which we found no impact of
AKI on 31- to 365-day mortality. In a UK cohort study
of 153 patients with AKI at ICU admission, Abosaif et
al. observed 6-month mortality of 43.3%, 53.6% and
86.0% for patients with AKI-risk, AKI-injury, and AKI￾failure, respectively [8]. The crude 6-month mortality
risk for patients with AKI-risk and AKI-injury corre￾sponds well with our findings.

Strengths and limitations
The main strengths of our study include its large size,
well-defined study population, uniform access to health
care in Denmark, comprehensive laboratory data includ￾ing baseline measurements from outpatient clinics and
general practitioners, and complete follow-up data.
However, several additional issues should be considered
when interpreting our results.
First, we used routine laboratory data to assess AKI at
ICU admission, and some creatinine measurements (that
is, those measured only with an arterial blood gas analy￾zer in the ICU) may not be transferred to the laboratory
database. We excluded patients without a creatinine
measurement at ICU admission. However, the overall
results did not change after imputation of AKI level.
Second, as our routine data did not include information
about urine output we could not utilize urine criteria in
the RIFLE classification of AKI. However, urine output
criteria are affected by diuretics, which are commonly
used in ICU patients. Third, we assessed AKI severity at
ICU admission, when follow-up commenced. We
thereby avoided including follow-up time before fulfil￾ment of AKI criteria, that is, immortal person-time
[33,34]. However this limits the generalization to
patients with AKI at ICU admission. Fourth, we did not
have detailed data on severity of illness scores at ICU
admission or during the ICU stay. The physiological
variables included in these scores may be part of the
causal pathway and adjustment may thereby attenuate
any true association [35]. Still, the impact of AKI on
mortality was evident in subgroups of ICU patients trea￾ted with mechanical ventilation and inotropes/vasopres￾sors, which may be indicators of more severe illness. In
general, correct selection of confounders in prognostic
studies of cohorts of ICU patients is challenging. Many
covariates may be part of the causal pathway from expo￾sure to outcome. Finally, despite adjustment for poten￾tial confounders, we cannot rule out unmeasured and
residual confounding.
Conclusions
In this large cohort study, AKI was present at ICU
admission in 15% of adult ICU patients. Any degree of
AKI at ICU admission was associated with markedly
increased 30-day mortality and the association was still
evident in the 31- to 365-day period. The association
was also robust in subgroups of ICU patients, with only
slight variation.
Key messages
• The increased risk of death in patients with AKI at
ICU admission was evident throughout the first year
after ICU admission.
• The association was evident regardless of age,
CKD, preexisting comorbidity, diagnostic category,
and surgical status.
• The relative 30-day mortality was highest in
younger age groups, elective surgical ICU patients,
and acute cardiac surgical ICU patients.
