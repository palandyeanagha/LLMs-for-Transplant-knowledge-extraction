Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► Gut microbiota is involved in human health and 
disease.
► Changes in faecal microbiota are associated 
with human benign or malign metabolic traits.
► Animal studies have suggested that intestinal 
transit time and bile acid metabolism are 
involved in these traits.
What are the new findings?
► Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from 
metabolically compromised obese donors 
temporarily worsens insulin sensitivity in 
human metabolic syndrome recipients, whereas 
a non-significant increase in insulin sensitivity 
is observed in recipients of FMT from healthy 
postgastric bypass donors.
► These differential changes are accompanied 
by alterations in intestinal transit time, resting 
energy expenditure, plasma metabolites and 
faecal bile acid composition.
► Response to donor FMT is associated with 
differences in faecal microbiota composition.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► This study helps to quantify the magnitude of 
gut microbiota-driven metabolic effects after 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
► This study underscores that poor donor 
metabolic profile can be transferred by FMT and 
therefore calls for careful metabolic profiling of 
faecal donors in and outside of clinical trials to 
reduce potential harm and increase potential 
benefit.
Abstract
Objective Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism.
Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced
obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism
and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether 
allogenic FMT using faeces from post-­Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from
metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term
effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and 
adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, 
insulin-resistant male subjects.
Design Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) 
received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. 
Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis 
were measured at baseline and 2weeks after FMT by
hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (2
H2
-glucose 
and 2
H5
-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters 
were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal 
transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile 
acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose 
tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal 
SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory 
parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.
Results We observed a significant decrease in insulin 
sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median 
rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/
kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards 
faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was 
seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids 
(increased lithocholic, deoxycholic and (iso)lithocholic 
acid after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers 
(decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) 
gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) 
and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.
Conclusion Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases 
insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when 
compared with using post-­RYGB-D. Further research is 
needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in 
FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.

current pharmacological treatment does not halt disease progres￾sion.1
 Bariatric surgery, in particular Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, has been effective in 
reversing insulin resistance, although the underlying mecha￾nisms are not fully understood. In this regard, data derived from 
animal models have suggested that metabolic improvements 
after RYGB may be causally related to an altered gut microbiota 
composition.2
Several studies have shown associations between obesity, 
intestinal microbiome3–7 and decreased intestinal transit 
time.8
 Moreover, it has been shown that subjects with normal, 
impaired and severely impaired (T2D) glucose tolerance can be 
classified based on their gut microbiota composition.9
 Despite 
a multitude of association studies, a causal role for the intes￾tinal microbiota in human disorders of glucose metabolism 
is less established. We recently confirmed potential causality 
of intestinal microbiota composition in regulation of human 
glucose metabolism by showing that faecal microbiota trans￾plantation (FMT) from lean healthy donors improves (periph￾eral) insulin sensitivity of subjects with METS. The effect was 
transient and seemed driven by recipient baseline faecal micro￾biota signature.10 11
A pivotal question in our pursuit to assess causality is whether 
FMT from non-lean donors or from post-RYBG donors (in 
METS recipients) could also affect glucose metabolism. In 
support of such an hypothesis, an elegant study by Liou et al2
in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice showed that FMT from
postbariatric surgery DIO donors resulted in significant weight 
loss and improved metabolism in the DIO recipients. Similarly, 
FMT from humans following RYGB also produced improved 
metabolic outcome compared with METS.12 We thus repeated 
this study in humans and investigated short-term effects of 
allogenic FMT using post-RYGB donors (RYGB-D) or meta￾bolic syndrome donors (METS-D) on insulin sensitivity and
lipolysis in METS recipients (RYGB-R and METS-R, respec￾tively; figure 1A), and correlated these effects with changes in 
gut microbiota composition. Secondary outcome parameters 
were intestinal transit time adipose tissue inflammatory gene 
expression, bile acid and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metab￾olism and resting energy expenditure (REE). We hypothesised 
that RYGB-D FMT leads to increased insulin sensitivity, in 
conjunction with faster intestinal transit time, as this would 
provide less opportunity for the bacterial translocation associ￾ated with inflammation and insulin resistance.

Gut microbiota
Materials and methods
Study design and inclusion of subjects and donors
Male adult (age 21–69) omnivorous Caucasian obese (body 
mass index (BMI) ≥30kg/m2
) subjects were recruited by 
newspaper advertisement and screened for METS using the 
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria 
for METS (≥3/5: fasting plasma glucose ≥5.6mmol/L,
triglycerides ≥1.7mmol/L, waist circumference >102cm, high￾density lipoprotein cholesterol <1.03mmol/L, blood pressure 
≥130/85mm Hg). Inclusion was limited to male Caucasian 
subjects to increase homogeneity of our study population and 
reproducibility and comparability across studies. Exclusion 
criteria were recent weight loss, cardiovascular events, chole￾cystectomy, use of any systemically acting medication in the last 
3months, a vegetarian diet and use of probiotics. Participants 
did not take food supplements.
Five post-RYGB-D were selected and recruited by their treating 
physician at Bariatric Surgery Clinic, Spaarne Hospital, Haarlem, 
The Netherlands. They were omnivorous, healthy Caucasian 
men who had lost at least 30% of their presurgery weight after 
1year and did not use any medication (except vitamins). Of note, 
none of the RYGB-D currently met the NCEP criteria for METS. 
Donors could donate to multiple recipients. Online supple￾mentary tables S1 and S2 provide an overview of each donor 
and their respective recipients. METS-D (n=6) were recruited 
through newspaper advertisement. All donors completed ques￾tionnaires regarding dietary and bowel habits, travel history, 
comorbidity including (family history of) diabetes mellitus and 
medication use. Donors did not use any medication (including 
probiotics). Donors were screened for the presence of infectious 
and other diseases, as specified in the online supplementary 
methods. Subjects with METS (n=22) were randomised using 
block randomisation to receive FMT from either RYGB-D or 
METS-D. Participants were blinded to the allocation for the 
duration of the study. The primary outcome parameter was 
change in insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinaemic 
euglycaemic clamp with stable isotope tracers (2
H2
-glucose) after 
2 weeks.
At baseline and 2weeks after treatment, all studies (including 
clamp, gastroscopy, 24-hour faeces collection and intestinal 
transit time measurement) were performed, while at 8weeks 
only diet lists, clinical evaluation, and blood and morning faecal 
collection took place. Participants filled in online dietary intake 
lists (www.voedingscentrum.nl) for 7days before each visit to 
monitor dietary caloric intake and food composition.
Written informed consent was obtained. The study was regis￾tered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR 4327).
Faecal transplant procedure
No antibiotics were given prior to FMT. A single FMT was 
performed in each subject. On the day of treatment, the donor 
produced fresh morning stool at home, which was brought to 
the hospital by the donor. After admission of the study subject, 
a duodenal tube was placed by gastroscopy. Each subject then 
underwent complete colon lavage with 3–4L of Klean-Prep 
(macrogol) by duodenal tube until the researcher judged that the 
bowel was properly lavaged (ie, no more solid excrement, but 
rather clear fluid). This took 3hours on average. Between 200 
g and 300 g of donor faeces was processed. Donor faeces were 
diluted in 500mL of 0.9% saline solution and filtered through 
unfolded cotton gauzes. The 500 cc filtrate was used for trans￾plantation, which was administered 2hours after the last admin￾istration of Klean-Prep by duodenal tube in around 30min using 
50 cc syringes. After a short observation period, the patient was 
sent home.
Hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp with stable isotope 
tracers and REE
Subjects were admitted at the metabolic unit after an overnight 
fast for a two-step hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp with 
stable isotope tracers,13 during which the rate of glucose disap￾pearance (Rd) was measured to estimate insulin sensitivity. REE 
was determined using indirect calorimetry. A more comprehen￾sive description of the clamp procedure and the calculation of 
isotope enrichments and endogenous glucose production (EGP) 
can be read in the online supplementary methods.
Biochemistry
Fasting glucose, insulin, C reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide￾binding protein, free fatty acids and lipid spectrum were 
determined using routine laboratory methods (see online supple￾mentary methods). Faecal bile acids in 2×24hour faeces were 
determined by gas chromatography as described earlier.11 Serum 
bile acids were extracted from plasma samples and measured 
by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry, as previously described.12 The 24-hour faecal 
energy content of lyophilised homogenised faeces (caloric bomb 
measurement) was determined with a bomb calorimeter (CBB 
330, using as a standard benzoic acid 6320cal/g). Faecal SCFAs 
were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography 
with ultraviolet detection as previously published.14 Chemokine 
ligand 2 (CCL2)) plasma levels were determined by the Human 
CCL2 Uncoated ELISA Kit (Invitrogen, ref# 88-7399-88) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantitative PCR in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies
In fasted subjects, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was 
aspirated using a hollow needle and a 50 cc syringe. RNA was 
isolated from adipose tissue biopsies using TriPure Isolation 
Reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, 
Germany). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared using 
SensiFAST cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bioline, UK), and mRNA expres￾sion was measured via SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX Kit (Bioline). 
The primers for MCP1, IL6, TNFα, IL10, Nf-κB, CD11b, CD68,
IRS1 and Leptin are summarised in online supplementary table 
S3. Expression levels were normalised to RPLP0. We stained for 
the presence of macrophages (crown-like structures) in subcuta￾neous adipose tissue, but failed due to poor quality of the (needle 
biopsy achieved) adipose tissue samples.
Intestinal transit time
Intestinal transit time was measured using Sitzmark capsules15 at 
baseline and 2weeks after FMT. Capsules containing 24 plastic 
ring-markers each were ingested on days 1, 2 and 3 (72 markers 
in total), and then colon X-ray imaging was performed on day 
4 to count the markers. The number of excreted markers was 
reported (72 minus the count). Reproducibility of the intestinal 
transit time measurement was determined by performing the 
Sitzmark capsule test twice (2weeks apart) in 10 subjects with 
METS (online supplementary figure S1).
Profiling of faecal microbiota composition by sequencing of 
the 16S rRNA gene
Faecal genomic DNA was isolated and faecal microbiota compo￾sition was profiled by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA 
gene. Preprocessing of the 16S rRNA amplicon sequence data

resulted in a final data set that comprised 801 operational taxo￾nomic units (OUPs) in 79 samples. A comprehensive description 
of the sequencing and preprocessing procedures can be read in 
the online supplementary methods.
Metabolomics
Global targeted metabolite profiling analysis was carried out on 
fasting plasma samples by Metabolon (Durham, North Carolina), 
using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to
tandem mass spectrometry, as previously described.16 Raw data 
were normalised to account for interday differences. Then, each 
biochemical was rescaled to set the median equal to 1. Missing 
values, generally due to the sample measurement falling below the 
limit of detection, were then imputed with the minimum observed 
value.
Predictive modelling
Elastic net regularised classification models17 with stability selec￾tion18 were used to identify microbial predictors of effects on insulin 
sensitivity. Elastic net is a machine learning algorithm that selects 
features based on their relative importance in making a prediction 
(in this case, belonging to the METS-R or RYGB-R group). This 
model is especially suited when the number of samples is much 
smaller than the number of variables. Elastic net is described in 
more detail in the online supplementary methods.
Power calculation, statistical analyses and exploratory 
analyses
We based our sample size calculation on the results of our earlier 
pilot FMT study,10 11 which showed a significant median increase 
in Rd on allogenic lean donor FMT. We anticipated that allogenic 
RYGB-D FMT to subjects with METS in our study would induce
a similar overall increase in median Rd of 12 µmol/kg/min, while 
allogenic METS-D FMT would probably have less effect (5 µmol/
kg/min) with an SD of 5 µmol/kg/min. Taking a 10% dropout 
rate into account, we would need 22 subjects with METS to be 
included overall. A non-Gaussian distribution for all clinical 
data was assumed, and thus results are presented as medians and 
IQRs. Statistical testing was carried out using (two-sided) non￾parametric tests. For between-group comparisons, the unpaired
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used, whereas a paired test was 
used for within-group comparisons of repeated measurements. A
false discovery rate-corrected p value below 0.05 was considered 
significant. For the exploratory analyses, we divided the RYGB-R
group into responders (≥10%increase in Rd) and non-responders
(<10%increase). The 10% is in line with our earlier studies
that report 10% interindividual session variance between clamp 
days.10 11 19 The METS-R group was divided into deteriorators
(≥10%decrease in Rd) and non-deteriorators (<10%decrease).
Results
Glucose metabolism: primary outcomes
The baseline characteristics of the subjects and donors are depicted 
in table 1. Figure 1A explains the study design. We observed a 
significant change in peripheral insulin sensitivity (mean Rd) on 
FMT from RYGB-D versus FMT from METS-D (figure 1B), our 
primary outcome parameter. When studying the groups separately, 
we observed that this differential effect was mainly driven by a 
significant decrease (median Rd from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min, 
p<0.01) in the METS-R group (n=10), which received FMT from 
METS-D, while the increase in peripheral insulin sensitivity from
33.9 to 36.2 µmol/kg/min in the RYGB-R group (n=12), which 
were subjects with METS who received FMT from RYGB-D, was 
not statistically significant. Of note, baseline peripheral insulin 
sensitivity in RYGB-D was significantly higher than in METS-D
(figure 1C). Finally, hepatic insulin sensitivity (suppression of 
EGP; figure 1D,E and online supplementary figure S2A) as well 
as the rate of lipolysis (online supplementary figure S2) were not 
significantly affected by either RYGB-D or METS-D FMT. Indi￾vidual donor and recipient values for Rd and EGP, as well as 
response or deterioration status, can be found in online supple￾mentary tables S2 and S3.
Glucose metabolism in responders and deteriorators: 
exploratory analyses
At baseline, RYGB-D were significantly more insulin-sensitive
than RYGB-R, whereas insulin sensitivity did not differ between 
METS-D and METS-R (figure 1F). Exploring the individual effects 
following FMT treatment (online supplementary figure S3A,B), we 
observed that Rd was not improved in any of the METS-R subjects.
In contrast, Rd deteriorated in only one of the RYGB-R subjects
(improvement or deterioration was defined as >10%increase
or <10%decrease in Rd, respectively).
Moreover, there was no statistically significant correlation 
(Spearman’s rank) between change in Rd in the recipient and the 
difference in Rd between recipient and donor (online supplemen￾tary figure S3C,D). However, in the METS-R group, all subjects 
who deteriorated received FMT from a donor with poorer Rd 
(online supplementary figure S3C), while all subjects who did not 
change had received FMT from donors with similar or better Rd 
(online supplementary figure S3C,D).

Changes in BMI REE and faecal energy excretion on FMT
BMI was not significantly different in METS-D versus 
METS-R (34kg/m² in METS-D vs 37 kg/m² in METS-R, p=0.08). 
As expected, BMI in RYGB-R was higher (36 kg/m² vs 31kg/m²)
than in RYGB-D (p=0.023). BMI did not change significantly
after FMT in either group at 2 or 8 weeks. REE did not change 
in either group (online supplementary figure S2C). Finally, faecal 
energy excretion (bomb calorimetry) did not change between 
week 0, 2 or 8 in either the RYGB-R (median from 1358 to 1021 
calories per 48hours between weeks 0 and 2, p=0.27) or the 
METS-R group (median from 1087 to 856 calories per 48hours,
p=0.37).
Intestinal transit time, faecal bile acid concentrations and

To verify the used Sitzmark method for intestinal transit time 
specifically for our study group, we first performed the test twice 
(n=10 subjects repeated 2weeks apart) in our subjects with METS 
in order to look at reproducibility. As depicted in online supple￾mentary figure S1 (Bland-Altman plot), our Sitzmark intestinal 
transit time calculation was reproducible (90% of measurement 
pairs within coefficient of variation of 2 SD). Intestinal transit 
did not change in the METS-R group (from 53±11to 49±10 
excreted markers/72hours; figure 1G and online supplementary 
figure S2D), whereas in the RYGB-R group we observed a trend 
towards faster intestinal transit (from 39±18to 56±12 excreted

markers/72hours; p=0.052) (figure 1H and online supplementary 
figure S2D). Individual donor and patient transit time can also be 
found in online supplementary tables S2 and S3. Because micro￾bially produced secondary bile acids and SCFA have been demon￾strated to regulate intestinal transit in mouse models,20 we next 
analysed their levels. Between baseline and 2weeks after FMT, we 
observed a significant increase in faecal levels of lithocholic acid, 
isolithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid (p<0.01) in the METS-R
group, whereas no effect was seen in the RYGB-R group (figure 2A). 
Faecal cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic 
acid did not change significantly in either group (data not shown). 
In agreement with the faecal levels, we also observed that the levels 
of lithocholic acid were increased in fasting plasma samples of 
the METS-R group (p=0.049), whereas deoxycholic acid plasma 
levels were unchanged. Although total plasma bile acids concentra￾tions were unchanged in both groups, fasting plasma taurolitho￾cholic acid (p=0.019) and glycolithocholic acid levels (p=0.011) 
were increased in the METS-R group, whereas plasma hyocholic 
acid was decreased (p=0.027) (figure 2B). Other plasma bile acids 
were unchanged in either group (online supplementary figure S4). 
Finally, total faecal SCFA propionate and butyrate levels (but not 
acetate) increased significantly in the METS-R group at week 2 but 
returned to baseline at week 8 (online supplementary figure S5).
Subcutaneous adipose tissue inflammation after FMT
While expression of most of the genes in our panel of inflam￾matory genes was largely unaffected (figure 3A,B shows tumour 
necrosis factor alpha, the rest not shown), expression of CCL2 
in subcutaneous adipose tissue was significantly reduced 
(figure 3C; p=0.01) in biopsies of the RYGB-R but not in the 
METS-R group (figure 3D). We subsequently found that fasting 
plasma CCL2 levels were also reduced in the RYGB-R group 
(p=0.059; figure 3E) but not in the METS-R group (figure 3F).
Gut microbiota
As depicted in figure 4A (principle component analysisplot), 
using conventional statistics allogenic FMT with either METS-D 
or RYGB-D had only moderate effects on faecal microbiota 
composition. In line, faecal microbial diversity (Shannon index) 
before and after FMT did not differ in either group, between 
groups, between donors and recipients at baseline, or between 
responders/non-responders or deteriorators/non-deteriorators 
(online supplementary figure S6). Using predictive modelling, 
we have identified several microbiota that changed differentially 
between treatment groups. These are depicted in figure 4B.
As we previously observed differential individual recipient 
responses to donor FMT,11 we next determined whether there 
was an association between baseline microbiota composition 
as well as with compositional change (delta microbiota abun￾dance) on one hand and clinical response to FMT on the other. 
To this end, we divided the RYGB-R group into responders 
(n=5) and non-responders (n=7), and the METS-R group into 
deteriorators (n=6) and non-deteriorators (n=4). Response 
was defined as ≥10%increase in Rd, while deterioration was 
defined as ≥10%decrease in Rd. Using predictive modelling 
(elastic net), we identified OTUs of which the relative change 
was predictive of responder/non-responder status in RYGB-R 
(figure 4C) and deteriorator/non-deteriorator status in METS-R 
(figure 4D). Also we observed OTUs of which baseline abun￾dance was predictive of recipient response status (figure 4E for 
RYGB-R and figure 4F for METS-R). We found that Alistipes 
shahii was predictive of responder status at baseline (figure 4E) 
in our predictive model and was significantly more abundant in 
responders versus non-responders (p=0.009, Wilcoxon; online 
supplementary figure S7A). Second, change (increase) in Anaero￾stipes hadrus, a butyrate producer that is associated with caloric 
restriction,21 was strongly associated with responder status 
(figure 4C); its abundance tripled in the responders, while it 
remained stable in the non-responders (p=0.051; online supple￾mentary figure S7C). Third, increase in Desulfovibrio ssp was 
predictive of metabolic deterioration on allogenic METS-D 
FMT (figure 4D and online supplementary figure S7D), which 
is notable as this strain is known to be increased in faeces of 
patients with T2D.22 Finally, high Coprococcus comes abun￾dance at baseline was predictive of deteriorator status (figure 4F
and online supplementary figure S7B), while an increase in

As shown in figure 5A,B, we correlated the abundance of 
microbial taxa with metabolic and anthropometric parameters in 
the RYGB-R and METS-R groups. We observed that changes in 
intestinal transit positively correlated with changes in the relative 
abundance of Dorea longicatena in the RYGB-R group (r=0.72,
p=0.01) (online supplementary figure S7G). As with C. comes,
changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity (Rd) also correlated posi￾tively with changes in the relative abundance of Alloprevotella

Metabolomics
We used predictive modelling to identify fasting plasma metab￾olites that differentiate between treatment groups (METS-R vs 
RYGB-R), between responders versus non-responders, and dete￾riorators versus non-deteriorators. In the responders versus non￾responders analyses, a number of metabolites were differentially 
changed between baseline and 2 weeks, including methyl indole￾3-acetate and phenylpyruvate (figure 6A). Similarly, a number 
of plasma metabolites differentiated between deteriorators and

Discussion
Over the past years the intestinal microbiota composition has 
been associated with altered metabolic processes,23 yet data on 
causality in human metabolism are scarce. In accordance with our 
previous FMT studies,10 11 we show in this study that individual 
FMT donor characteristics can significantly influence metabolic 
effects of FMT in the recipients. We found that METS-D FMT 
had a negative effect on Rd, while RYGB-D FMT mainly accel￾erated intestinal transit. As our METS FMT donors were char￾acterised by lower peripheral insulin sensitivity (Rd) than their 
METS recipients, a gut microbiota-driven transmissible trait of 
insulin resistance in obesity is a tempting explanation. Although 
the sample size of our study was small, our data do underscore 
the potential causal effect of individual FMT gut microbiome 
composition on recipients’ metabolism.
Metabolic traits of allogenic FMT donors may drive recipient 
metabolic response
Similar to our previous FMT studies,10 11 we found that donor 
FMT treatment affects faecal microbiota composition and has 
a transient and differential metabolic effect in insulin-resistant 
subjects. With respect to metabolic phenotype, it is interesting 
to note that allogenic METS-D FMT resulted in a significant 
decline in Rd, while RYGB-D FMT did not reduce peripheral 
insulin sensitivity (Rd) in the recipients. However, the clinical 
effect in our human subjects was much smaller and more diverse 
than the large metabolic improvements that were reported in 
DIO mice receiving post-RYGB FMT treatment.2
 Interestingly, 
we previously observed similar effects on CCL2 on changes in 
gut microbiota composition in mice,24 suggesting regulation of 
adipose tissue inflammation by gut microbiota in humans. More￾over and in line with our previous work,10 our RYGB-R non￾responders all had a low Rd at baseline, suggesting that when 
insulin sensitivity is already poor residual metabolic flexibility 
is insufficient and less effect from microbial intervention can be 
expected, which may explain the lack of significant improve￾ment in the RYGB-R group.
FMT affects bile acids, SCFAs, metabolites and intestinal 
transit time
Animal studies have shown that gut microbiota composition 
affects bile acid metabolism.25 In contrast to lean healthy donor 
FMT that specifically increased the primary bile acid cholic acid 
concentrations,11 26 in the current study we observed a signifi￾cant increase of the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid in plasma 
and faeces, and of isolithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid in 
faeces of METS-R (p<0.01). Underscoring potential clinical 
and therapeutic relevance, previous studies have shown that 
bile acid concentrations are altered in patients with T2D,27 28
and treatment with bile acid sequestrants affects glucose metab￾olism.29 Moreover, bile acids are thought to increase intestinal 
transit through takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5),30
which is in line with our finding that transit time correlated 
inversely with faecal isolithocholic acid (figure 5A). The 
observed increase in secondary bile acids in METS-R, which 
coincided with higher bile acid levels in the donors, may indi￾cate increased transport of bile acids into the colon induced

by higher microbial bile salt hydrolase activity. Finally, with 
respect to changes in fasting plasma metabolites (see figure 6A), 
methyl indole-3-acetate has been linked to an improved meta￾bolic profile in a murine model of insulin resistance.31 In line, 
older literature has linked phenylpyruvate to increased insulin 
secretion from beta cells,32 which may explain the improved 
insulin sensitivity in the responder patients. In contrast, dihy￾droferulate (see figure 6B) was associated with worsening of 
insulin resistance. Interestingly, dihydroferulate is also known 
as 3-(4-hydroxy-3-3methoxyphenyl) propionic acid, which is a 
derivative from propionic acid, an SCFA that has recently been 
linked to increased risk of T2D.33
Gut microbiota composition at baseline may predict 
metabolic effects of FMT
By employing predictive modelling using machine learning, we 
have identified several microbial OTUs of interest that may predict 
metabolic response. In this regard A. shahii is associated with altered 
cardiometabolic status.34 Also, Clostridium cluster IV has been 
linked to healthy glucose metabolism in humans.35 In conjunction, 
D. longicatena (previously linked with a healthy gut microbiota 
homeostasis36 37 and with more favourable metabolic outcomes in 
insulin-resistant obese subjects11 38) predicted FMT response and 
was associated with increased intestinal transit time. Subsequently, 
whereas baseline plasma levels 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate were

sphingomyelin levels known to drive insulin resistance39 were 
indeed associated with deterioration in insulin sensitivity (online 
supplementary figure S8A,B). Together, these data suggest that gut 
microbiota-derived plasma metabolites indeed may regulate insulin 
resistance balance in obese humans.
Use of allogenic donors with METS for the control group
In our previous studies autologous faecal transplantation was 
done in the control group. However, in theory the observed 
effects after allogenic versus autologous FMT may stem from a 
non-specific immunological reaction on receiving foreign micro￾biota rather than from a specific microbiota composition. This 
key issue was addressed in the current study by using an allogenic 
control group. Our previous studies show that metabolic effects 
and changes in microbiota composition are temporary and have 
resolved 12–18 weeks after FMT,10 11 so we did not expect lasting 
negative metabolic effects. Indeed, our results show homeostatic 
model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 8 weeks had 
not deteriorated in our METS-R control group (slight improve￾ment, p=0.34) in comparison with HOMA-IR at baseline. From 
the current data we conclude that the use of allogenic METS 
control donors in future studies seems unnecessary and unde￾sirable, resolving a fundamental methodological issue in human 
FMT studies in subjects with METS.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size of our study 
was small and the metabolic effects were moderate. Nevertheless, 
our clinical data suggest that the metabolic signature of the FMT 
donor can be transferred temporarily to the recipient and that 
this may be driven by specific intestinal microbial signatures.
Second, subjects were allowed to keep their own diet, which was 
closely monitored by dietary recall, but allows for more variation 
in the data compared with a standardised diet.40 Only European 
men of Caucasian descent were included, and thus results may not 
apply to the general multiethnic Western world population, subsets 
of which have different faecal microbiota composition.41
Third, a possible explanation for a lack of effect of the 
RYGB-D FMT is the fact that the RYGB microbiota is well 
selected and kept under pressure by the rearrangements of the 
GI tract introduced by bariatric surgery. In the absence of such 
rearrangements in intestinal physiology, the RYGB-adapted 
microbiota may lack the selective force for the maintenance of 
its structure, and therefore cannot be engrafted durably in the 
recipient human host. This could explain the difference with the 
observed beneficial effects in the murine RYGB FMT model2
 as 
these mice were kept in extremely controlled conditions and 
isolated from the external environment, so that environmental 
microbes and possible normal gut colonisers are not encoun￾tered. On the other hand, it is also likely that the human host 
immune system develops resilience, which in combination with 
the persistent adherence to one’s own lifestyle including diet40
could explain the return of intestinal microbiota composition to 
the baseline situation and the modest magnitude of short-term 
and long-term metabolic response.42 Nevertheless, our data 
underscore the potential causal effect of individual gut micro￾biome composition on human metabolism. Future FMT studies 
will have to confirm our findings, but additional prospective 
studies are required to further unravel the potential interaction 
between dietary intake, intestinal microbiota composition and 
subsequent changes in intestinal and whole body metabolism.
