Abstract
To determine whether decreased renal responsiveness to
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in diabetes is mediated by
alterations in the renal ANP receptor, ANP receptor density
and affinity were measured 17-20 d after streptozotocin
injection and compared with values in vehicle-treated con￾trols and streptozotocin-treated rats made euglycemic with
insulin. Plasma ANP concentration was significantly greater
in hyperglycemic diabetic rats than in control or euglycemic
diabetic rats. Both in glomeruli and inner medulla, ANP
receptor dissociation constant did not differ among the three
study groups, whereas the maximum binding capacity was
decreased significantly in hyperglycemic diabetics in com￾parison with controls and euglycemic diabetics. Glomerular
clearance receptors were also decreased significantly in hy￾perglycemic diabetic rats in comparison with control and
euglycemic diabetic rats. To determine whether the de￾creased number of renal ANP receptors in diabetic rats was
associated with a decreased biological response, we mea￾sured ANP-dependent cyclic GMP (cGMP) accumulation
by isolated glomeruli and inner medullary collecting duct
cells in vitro. cGMP accumulation was significantly less in
hyperglycemic diabetic rats than in controls or euglycemic
diabetic rats both in the presence or absence of the phospho￾diesterase inhibitor zaprinast. cGMP phosphodiesterase ac￾tivity in inner medullary collecting duct cells obtained from
control and hyperglycemic diabetic rats did not differ. Thus,
the decreased number of biologically active ANP receptors
in the kidneys of diabetic rats is accompanied by decreased
biological responsiveness in vitro and provides a potential
explanation for the reduction in renal sensitivity to ANP in
this condition. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:2451-2457.) Key

respectively. Whereas the kidney is the principal organ responsi￾ble for the chronic regulation of body sodium and fluid composi￾tion (4), renal disease per se is an unlikely explanation for these
abnormalities since they can occur quite early in the disease,
even when glomerular filtration rate is normal and proteinuria
is minimal (1, 2). Enhanced renal tubular reabsorption and/
or impaired responses to natriuretic influences are more likely
explanations.
In both rats (5-7) and humans (8) with insulinopenic diabe￾tes, the glomerular and tubular response of the kidney to atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP)' is decreased. The basis for this de￾creased responsiveness has not been established, but may in￾volve an abnormality of renal ANP receptors. Three distinct
natriuretic peptide receptors have been identified (9): ANPR-A
and ANPR-B, also called GC-A and GC-B, are both membrane
guanylyl cyclases that synthesize cyclic GMP (cGMP) as an
intracellular second messenger (9, 10). ANPR-C, also known
as the ANP clearance receptor, does not signal through activa￾tion of guanylyl cyclase, but may serve as a clearance receptor
for natriuretic peptides; it may also function through intermedi￾ate guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins to inhibit adenylyl
cyclase (11). While ANPR-A and ANPR-B have rather strict
structural requirements for ligand binding (12-15), ANPR-C
has less rigorous structural requirements and binds the internally
deleted analogues of ANP (c-ANP) (12, 16-18), compounds
which do not activate the membrane guanylate cyclase.
ANPR-A and ANPR-C receptors and their mRNAs have
been demonstrated in the kidney using in situ autoradiographic
techniques (19, 20) and in situ hybridization (21), respectively.
This study was designed to investigate the type, number, and
affinity of ANP receptors in the kidney of rats with streptozo￾tocin (STZ)-induced diabetes and to assess the biological activ￾ity of these receptors by measuring ANP-dependent cGMP ac￾cumulation by glomeruli and inner medullary collecting duct
cells (IMCD) isolated from these rats.
Methods
Preparation of diabetic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Bantin and
Kingman, Inc., Fremont, CA), ranging in weight from 200 to 250 g,
were maintained on standard rat chow and tap water ad libitum with a
12-h light/dark cycle in a quiet environment. In 19 rats, diabetes mellitus
was induced by intravenous administration of STZ (Sigma, Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO), 60 mg/kg body wt, dissolved in sodium citrate
buffer (0.1 mol/liter, pH 4.5) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml immediately
before use. Control rats (n = 11), which were matched for age and
weight at the time of STZ administration, received an equal volume of
the vehicle. Animals were considered to be diabetic if blood glucose

levels were 350 mg/dl or greater 72 h after the injection. Diabetic
rats were further divided into two subgroups: rats to which human
recombinant insulin (Humulin N; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN)
was administered once daily in a fixed dose (2 U/d, n = 11) to prevent
ketosis, and rats to which insulin was administered in doses that were
adjusted to achieve euglycemia (6-10 U/d, n = 8). Blood glucose levels
were measured on a drop of blood obtained by tail vein nicking (Accu￾check bG; Bio-Dynamics, Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). To
determine the 24-h urine volume and the rate of excretion of sodium
and cGMP, rats were placed in metabolic cages on the day before killing.
Rats were killed by decapitation 17-20 d after the administration of
STZ, and trunk blood was collected for determination of plasma glucose
and ANP levels. The kidneys were quickly removed, decapsulated, snap￾frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -800C. Plasma ANP was mea￾sured by radioimmunoassay (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., Belmont,
CA), after extraction with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 75% methanol.
Receptor binding studies. The density of ANP receptors was as￾sessed by a modification of an in situ receptor binding assay (19) as
reported previously (20). Briefly, tissue sections (10 jLm) were cut on
a cryostat at - 15'C, thaw-mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated slides,
dried in vacuo for 18 h at -4 to +40C over silica gel, and stored in
sealed Bakelite boxes at -80mC. Immediately before assay, the slides
were brought to room temperature. Sections were preincubated for 10
min at room temperature in 100 ul of a buffer (buffer A) containing
30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 120 mM sodium chloride, 0.3%
bacitracin, and 0.5% receptor grade bovine serum albumin. After prein￾cubation, the buffer was replaced with 100 sll of fresh buffer A con￾taining increasing concentrations (from 25 to 1,500 pM) of ["25I]-rat￾ANP (1-28) (2,200 ttCilmmol; DuPont/New England Nuclear, Boston,
MA), and the sections were placed in a humidified chamber and incu￾bated at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation, the slides were
rinsed in an ice-cold buffer containing 30 mM sodium phosphate and
120 mM sodium chloride for 10 s, washed in the same buffer for 5 min,
rinsed in deionized water for 10 s, and dried for 2 h in a stream of cool
air. For autoradiography, the sections were exposed to LKB-Ultrofilm
(Leica Inc., Deerfield, IL) for 3-5 d at room temperature, and films
were processed with Kodak D-19 developer and rapid fixer (Eastman
Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Thereafter, the amount of radioligand
bound to the tissue sections was determined by placing the slides in a
gamma counter. Regional analysis of ANP binding to glomeruli and
inner medulla was performed using film autoradiography. Optical den￾sity in the different regions was measured by computerized microdensi￾tometry (Image-Analysis-OS2; Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherines,
Ontario, Canada).
Nonspecific binding was determined on adjacent sections under
identical incubation conditions except for the addition of 1 qM unlabeled
rat ANP (1-28) (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.). ANPR-C receptors were
identified by addition of 10 ttM c-ANP (4-23) (Peninsula Laboratories,
Inc.). ANPR-A receptors were calculated by subtraction of ANPR-C
receptors from total ANP receptors. The apparent dissociation constant
(Kd) and the maximal binding capacity (B,,,,) were calculated by Scatch￾ard analysis using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (22).
Because 10 uM c-ANP (4-23) could theoretically occupy some of the
ANPR-A receptors, we performed experiments in which IMCD cells
obtained from kidneys of normal rats were incubated with 10 jiM c￾ANP (4-23) and cGMP production was measured (see below). Accumu￾lation of cGMP did not differ significantly in cells incubated with or
without cGMP (126±15 vs 119±21 fmol/mg protein per 10 min, respec￾tively), ruling out the possibility of significant c-ANP binding to ANPR￾A receptors at this concentration.
Preparation of isolated glomeruli and IMCD cells. Under Inactin*
(BYK, Gulden, Germany) anesthesia (100 mg/kg body wt, intraperitone￾ally), the suprarenal aorta was cross-clamped via the distal aorta, and
the kidneys were flushed with cold isotonic saline (5-10 ml). Glomeruli
were isolated as described previously (23). In brief, for each preparation
the renal cortices were dissected and minced to a pastelike consistency.
The homogenate was passed successively through a 106-pAm sieve that
excluded the tubules and blood vessels and a 75-/Am sieve that retained
the glomeruli and allowed cells and small debris to pass through. Glo￾meruli were suspended in ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4,
containing 135 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM potassium chloride, 10
mM sodium acetate, and 5 mM glucose (buffer B) and centrifuged at
120 g for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was
resuspended in the same buffer and recentrifuged. By light microscopic
examination, the final pellet consisted of nearly pure isolated decapsu￾lated glomeruli with < 5% contamination with tubules. No afferent or
efferent arterioles were observed.
IMCD cells were isolated as follows (24): the kidneys were perfused
with 50-60 ml of saline followed by 5 ml of saline containing 0.2%
of collagenase (type II; Sigma Chemical Co.). The inner medullae were
excised, finely minced, and incubated in the same solution for 90 min
at 37TC. The resulting suspension of inner medullary cells was layered
on a 16% Ficoll (Sigma Chemical Co.) solution in nonbicarbonate Ring￾er's buffer (buffer C) and centrifuged at 2,300 g for 40 min. Cells were
subsequently washed through buffer C and then a solution of buffer C
containing 7.5% albumin to remove traces of contaminating collagenase.
Determination ofcGMP accumulation by glomeruli and IMCD cells.
Freshly isolated glomeruli were resuspended in buffer B with 1 mM
calcium chloride and IMCD cells in buffer C containing 7.5 mM glucose.
350-Al aliquots containing 0.2-0.5 mg protein/tube were preincubated
for 10 min at 37°C in a shaking water bath. Incubations were then
carried out for 10 min at 37°C with varying doses of ANP (10-10 to
10-6 M), in the presence or absence of a phosphodiesterase (PDE)
inhibitor, zaprinast (1 mM, M&B 22,948; Rhone-Poulenc, Rorer, Da￾genham, United Kingdom). Incubations were terminated by adding 750
til of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA; final concentration, 6.6%) and
cooling to 4°C. The precipitated protein was sedimented by centrifuga￾tion at 4,500 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, and the pellets were dissolved in
0.5 N sodium hydroxide and assayed for protein content by the method
of Lowry (25) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The superna￾tant fluid was extracted five times with four volumes of water-saturated
ethyl ether to remove the TCA before being evaporated to dryness under
a stream of air and stored at -70°C until assayed for cGMP content.
For the cGMP assay, samples were dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate
buffer, pH 6.2, mixed thoroughly, and 100 ul aliquots acetylated and
assayed in duplicate with a commercially available kit according to
the manufacturer's instructions (New England Nuclear). Results are
expressed as femtomoles of cGMP generated per milligram of protein
per 10 min of incubation.
Preparation of IMCD cell membranes and cytosol. IMCD cell mem￾branes were prepared by homogenizing freshly dispersed cells in 10
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM Mes, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1
jiM leupeptin, 0.1 ,uM pepstatin, 0.1 sM PSMF, 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM
2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cytosol was obtained by
homogenizing cells in a buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3
mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA, in an amount equal to 1:3 wet wt/
volume. In each case, cells were homogenized in a Potter-type Teflon￾glass homogenizer for 10-12 strokes at 4°C; the homogenates were
initially centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min and the resultant supernatants
were incubated with agitation at 4°C for 60 min followed by centrifuga￾tion at 100,000 g for 60 min. The resulting pellets containing membranes
were resuspended in 1:10 vol/vol homogenizing buffer, rehomogenized,
and again ultracentrifuged, while the supernatants representing the cyto￾solic fraction were stored on ice. The supernatant from the second
high speed centrifugation was added to that previously collected and
immediately frozen at -700C for subsequent determination of PDE
activity, and the pellet resuspended in 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 50
mM NaCl for assay of guanylate cyclase activity.
Determination of guanylate cyclase activity in IMCD cells mem￾branes. Guanylate cyclase activity was assayed by a modification of the
method of Cunning (26). Briefly, enzyme activity was determined by
incubation of 40-100 ug of membrane protein with 4-5 mM GTP
substrate in the presence of 2 mM manganese, 1.2 mM isoutylmethyl￾xanthine, 5 mM theophylline, creatine phosphokinase (3 U), and 7.5
mM phosphocreatine. All incubations were performed for 5 min at 37°C
and terminated by 12% TCA precipitation. After centrifugation, the
supernatants were ether extracted, air-dried, and reconstituted in 50 mM
sodium acetate (pH 6.2) followed by cGMP measurements in duplicate

incubation time (1-10 min) and protein concentration (10-100 Ag).
Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie protein assay.
Determination of PDE activity in IMCD cells. cGMP PDE activity
was assayed according to the method of Torres et al. (27). Cytosolic
fractions of IMCD cell homogenates, collected as described (10-15 pg
protein/tube), were incubated with 1 jLM [3H]cGMP (New England
Nuclear) in 200 I1 of a buffer containing 10 MM magnesium sulphate,
2 mM EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5). After a 20-min incubation period at 37°C, the reaction was stopped
by heating at 95°C for 3 min, and the 3H-5'-nucleotide products con￾verted to 3H-nucleosides by incubation with an excess of 5'-nucleotidase
(Crotalus atrox snake venom; Sigma Chemical Co.). Nucleosides were
separated from nucleotides on a QAE-Sephadex column according to
the procedure of Wells et al. (28) and column eluates counted for 3H
activity in a liquid scintillation counter. Enzyme activity is expressed
in picomoles of cGMP hydrolyzed per minute per milligram of protein.
With this assay, activity was linear over time and with protein concentra￾tion.

Results
Blood glucose, body weight, and plasma ANP. Hyperglycemia
occurred within 3 d of administration of STZ and persisted
thereafter in the rats that received low-dose insulin therapy (Fig.
1, Table I). Hyperglycemia was completely ameliorated in the
rats that received the higher doses of insulin (Fig. 1, Table I).
Rats treated with the higher doses of insulin gained weight
rapidly, reaching values not significantly different from control
at the end of the experimental period (Fig. 1, Table I), whereas
the rate of growth was significantly slower in the rats with
persistent hyperglycemia. The kidney weight at the end of the
experiment was comparable in the three groups, although the
kidney weight/body weight ratio was significantly greater (P
< 0.01) in the hyperglycemic diabetic than in control and eugly￾cemic diabetic rats (Table I).
Plasma levels of ANP were significantly greater in hypergly￾cemic diabetic rats than in control rats (Table I). The administra￾tion of insulin to diabetic rats in doses sufficient to maintain
their blood glucose concentration within the normal range re￾sulted in a normalization of plasma levels of ANP.
ANP receptor binding. The distribution of ["5I]-rat ANP
binding in the kidney of control rats is shown in Fig. 2 A.
Binding of radioligand was found in both cortical and medullary
regions of rat kidney. In the cortex, the radioligand binding was
localized primarily in glomeruli. In the outer medulla, bound
radioligand was found in longitudinal bands in the inner stripe,
corresponding to medullary vascular bundles (29). Minimal ra￾dioligand binding was found in the interbundle areas, whereas
binding to papillae was high. Nonspecific binding was < 10%
(Fig. 2 B). Incubation with c-ANP markedly reduced binding
of the radioligand to glomeruli (Fig. 2 C). A similar distribution
of radioligand binding and pattern of inhibition by unlabeled
ANP and c-ANP were found in the kidney of diabetic rats (Fig.
2 D).

the plot of specific binding, was approached at a concentration of 1.2

gested the presence of a single receptor site in each of the three
experimental groups (Fig. 4). ANP receptor affinity, expressed
as the apparent Kd, did not differ among the three study groups,
whereas the Bm, for ANP was significantly decreased in hyper￾glycemic diabetic rats as compared with controls and normogly￾cemic diabetic rats. Regional analysis of ANP binding was per￾formed by computerized microdensitometry and showed that
ANPR-A receptor density was decreased both in glomeruli and
inner medulla in the hyperglycemic diabetic rats. Equilibrium
binding data obtained in glomeruli in the presence of c-ANP
showed that the number of ANPR-C receptors was significantly
lower in the kidney of hyperglycemic diabetic rats in compari￾son with controls and euglycemic diabetics (Table II).
cGMP accumulation by glomeruli and IMCD cells and gua￾nylate cyclase activity. ANP induced a dose-dependent increase
in glomerular cGMP generation in the three groups (Fig. 5).
Both in glomeruli and IMCD cells, cGMP accumulation was
lower in hyperglycemic diabetic rats than in controls at the
higher concentrations used. Similar differences between hyper￾glycemic diabetic and control rats were found when glomeruli
were incubated in the presence of zaprinast (Fig. 6), indicating
that these differences could not be ascribed to an alteration
in the activity of cGMP PDE. Guanylate cyclase activity was
comparable in membranes obtained from IMCD cells in control
(5,983±548 fmol GMP mg protein-' * min-) and hyperglyce￾mic diabetic (5,835±814 fmol GMP- mg protein-' * min-) rats,
indicating no effect of diabetes on basal activity of this enzyme.
PDE enzymatic activity in IMCD cells. Measurement of
PDE enzymatic activity in IMCD cytosol showed comparable
values in control (180±28 fmol- mg protein-' -min-') and
hyperglycemic diabetic rats (156±23 fmol- mg protein-1-

Discussion
This study demonstrates that the number of ANP receptors is
decreased in the kidney of rats with STZ-induced diabetes melli￾2454 Sechi et al.

tus. This abnormality is associated with a decreased production
of cGMP by glomeruli and IMCD cells which is not corrected
by inhibition of PDE activity.
When studied 2 wk after administration of STZ, we found
that plasma ANP levels in hyperglycemic diabetic rats were
significantly increased in comparison with controls and that
insulin therapy sufficient to achieve strict glycemic control nor￾malized plasma ANP levels. In previous studies, plasma ANP
levels in diabetic rats were increased as early as 1 wk after STZ
injection (30) and persisted at elevated levels for at least 6 wk
(7, 31). Plasma ANP levels are also increased in patients with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy

low-dose, and high-dose insulin-treated rats. ANP induced a dose￾dependent increase in cGMP in the three groups. In both glomeruli and
IMCD cells, cGMP production was lower in low-dose insulin-treated
diabetic rats than in controls at the higher concentrations used. Data are
mean±SEM of eight control, four low-dose, and five high-dose insulin￾treated rats for glomeruli and six control, five low-dose, and four high￾dose insulin-treated rats for IMCD cells.
(8, 32-35). This increase in ANP levels could be a consequence
of the plasma volume expansion present in both STZ-diabetic
rats (7, 31, 36, 37) and patients with diabetes mellitus (2, 38-
41). Despite increased plasma levels of ANP, the response to
maneuvers known to stimulate the release of the peptide, such
as saline infusion, is impaired (5, 31). This has been interpreted
as a consequence of partial exhaustion of the storage pool of
the hormone as also demonstrated by morphologic studies in
which the abundance of secretory granules is decreased in atrial
cardiomyocytes obtained from diabetic rats (31, 42).
Blunted glomerular and tubular responses to volume expan￾sion (5, 6) and exogenous ANP infusion (7) have been reported
in rats with STZ-induced diabetes. Similarly, a decreased natri￾uretic response to endogenously secreted ANP has been shown
in type 1 diabetic subjects after head-out water immersion (8).
In the present study, we found that the number of both biological
and clearance ANP receptors is significantly decreased in the
kidneys of STZ-diabetic rats, providing an explanation for the
decreased renal response to the hormone. Similarly, Benigni et

Circulating levels of peptide hormones may directly regulate
target tissue receptor number, and plasma concentrations may
negatively correlate with the density of specific receptors (46).
This also applies to circulating ANP, the levels of which deter￾mine receptor density in the kidney (47-49). Therefore, homol￾ogous down-regulation caused by increased plasma ANP levels
is the most obvious explanation of the decreased ANP receptor
/
number in the kidney of diabetic rats. Alternatively, a decreased
b number of receptors could reflect a primary phenomenon inde￾pendent of plasma ANP levels. It has been shown that the
* number of glomerular receptors for other circulating peptides
such as angiotensin II (50, 51) and thromboxane A2 (52) are
decreased in diabetes mellitus. It is also known that glucose
levels regulate the activity of protein kinase C (53, 54) which
in turn regulates the number of receptors present on the cell
membrane (55, 56). Therefore, it is possible that receptors for

lin-treated rats, in the presence of zaprinast. ANP induced a dose￾dependent increase in cGMP in both groups. cGMP generation was
lower in low-dose insulin-treated diabetic rats at the highest concentra￾tion used. Glomerular cGMP generation in high-dose insulin-treated
diabetic rats was identical to that shown for control rats. Data are
mean±SEM of eight control, four low-dose, and five high-dose insulin￾treated rats.
In summary, our results demonstrate a reduced binding of
ANP in both glomeruli and IMCD cells of diabetic rat kidneys.
The diminished binding is associated with diminished biological
activity in vitro in these target sites of renal ANP action. This
abnormality may consequently be the mechanism underlying
renal resistance to ANP in diabetic animals and patients.

al. (7) reported a reduction in the number of cortical ANP
receptors in rats with STZ-induced diabetes 6 wk after injection.
In that study, however, no distinction was made between clear￾ance and biological receptors. Consistent with our findings, no
change in receptor affinity was found by those investigators. A
reduction in the number of clearance receptors, together with
the persistent stimulation of ANP release from atria due to an
increase in extracellular fluid volume, could explain the increase
in plasma ANP levels found in STZ diabetes.
Most renal actions of ANP are thought to be mediated by
cGMP (43, 44). Measurement of cGMP in glomeruli incubated
in the presence of increasing concentrations of ANP indicated
that the glomerular response to the hormone is significantly
reduced in STZ-diabetic rats, providing indirect evidence of
decreased renal sensitivity to ANP. A decreased response to
ANP could be explained by an increased activity of cGMP PDE
as described in other proteinuric conditions (45) as well as
reduced binding of ANP to the ANPR-A receptor. To evaluate
the role of PDE activity in the blunted ANP responsiveness of
diabetic glomeruli and IMCD cells, we performed additional
experiments in the presence of a PDE inhibitor. Incubation with
zaprinast (an inhibitor specific for cGMP PDE) did not correct
the difference in ANP-stimulated cGMP generation by glomeru￾lar suspensions obtained from hyperglycemic-diabetic and con￾trol rats, making unlikely a role of this enzyme in the decreased
cGMP accumulation. Similarly, intrinsic activity of membrane￾bound guanylate cyclase did not differ between normals and
diabetics, suggesting that alteration in the guanylate cyclase
portion of the ANPR-A receptor in its intracellular domain was
not altered by the diabetic state, and lending further support to
the contention that blunted responsiveness of diabetic kidneys
to ANP in vivo (5-7) and impaired cGMP accumulation in
vitro (Fig. 5) may be linked to the decrease in binding of ANP
which we have demonstrated.
