Fibrosis and other histological features in chronic
hepatitis C virus infection: a statistical model
V S Wong, D G DWight, C R Palmer, G J M Alexander
Abstract
Aims-To study the inter-relation between
hepatic fibrosis and other histological fea￾tures of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection.
Methods-Liver biopsy specimens from
200 consecutive patients with chronic
HCV infection were graded and staged
separately for necro-inflammatory activ￾ity and for fibrosis. The interaction be￾tween fibrosis and other histological fea￾tures was evaluated by univariate and
multivariate analysis, followed by hierar￾chical log linear modelling.
Results-The most striking feature was
the presence of portal tract inflammation
in 177 (89%) of 200 samples. Lymphoid
aggregates/follicles were observed either
alone or as part of the general inflamma￾tory infiltration of the portal tracts in 120
(60%) of 200 samples. Fatty change
(macro- and microvesicular steatosis) was
observed in 76 (38%) samples: mild to
moderate in 60 (30%) and diffuse in 16
(8%). Bile duct damage was found in 30
(15%) of 200 specimens. Lobular activity
was found in 154 (77%) of 200 samples and
was significant in 44; piecemeal necrosis
was present in 79 (40%). Thirty one (16%)
patients had stage 0 liver fibrosis, 27 (14%)
had stage 1, 69 (35%) had stage 2, 43 (22%)
had stage 3, 16 (8%) had stage 4, and 12
(6%) had stage 5. On log linear analysis,
piecemeal necrosis, lobular inflammation
and steatosis were linked directly with
fibrosis. Portal tract inflammation was
linked directly and indirectly via piece￾meal necrosis and lobular inflammation
with fibrosis. The presence of lymphoid
aggregates was associated with bile duct
damage.
Conclusions-Portal tract inflammation
with lymphoid aggregates or follicles,
together with fatty change, bile duct dam￾age and/or lobular activity, are character￾istic of chronic HCV infection, confirming
previous reports. Piecemeal necrosis,
lobular inflammation, portal inflamma￾tion, and steatosis are linked directly with
fibrosis in this statistical model, suggest￾ing a close inter-relation in the develop￾ment of fibrosis/cirrhosis.

Keywords: hepatitis C virus, chronic infection, fibrosis,
piecemeal necrosis.
Following the recognition of post-transfusion
non-A, non-B hepatitis in the 1970s, several
studies have documented the histopathological
changes in the livers of these patients."l How￾ever, because of the lack of specific serological
tests to identify the underlying aetiological
agent, these reports could not be entirely accu￾rate or conclusive. The recent discovery of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) combined with the
development of sensitive and specific first and
second generation assays to detect HCV
infection5 7 confirmed HCV as the major cause
of post-transfusion hepatitis and a substantial
proportion of sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis.
The histological features of chronic hepatitis
have traditionally been subdivided qualitatively
into chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic lobu￾lar hepatitis and chronic active hepatitis in a
classification which embraces all varieties of
chronic hepatitis including autoimmune and
viral disease.8'0 This classification was later
used to distinguish subgroups according to the
degree of disease activity to provide prognostic
information and criteria for the use of immu￾nosuppressive therapy." These studies also
documented the role of lobular parenchymal
lesions and piecemeal necrosis, particularly
bridging hepatic necrosis, in the progression
from chronic hepatitis into cirrhosis.9 '1 More
recently, the concepts of grading and staging
have been borrowed from tumour pathology
and applied to chronic hepatitis. Activity, in the
form of necro-inflammatory damage, is likened
to the grade whilst fibrosis, or degree of
damage, is likened to the stage.'2 13 The
concept of an overall score has proved very
useful in the context of clinical trials, allowing
direct comparisons to be made between biopsy
specimens both within the same patient and in
different studies. However, the final aggregate
score derived, a number, remains somewhat
arbitrary as it is weighted by the arbitrary deci￾sion which has been taken between which indi￾vidual features are scored and which are merely
noted.
In addition to chronic lobular hepatitis, the
histological findings considered characteristic
of chronic HCV infection include lymphoid
aggregates within portal tracts, parenchymal
fatty change and bile duct damage."'6 The
relative importance of these additional types of
hepatocellular damage in the pathogenesis of
cirrhosis in HCV remains uncertain. The
current study was therefore designed to evalu￾ate independently the influence on the stage
(or degree of fibrosis) of each of the three fea￾Department of

tures listed above, none of which is scored in
the modified Knodell system," as well as the
four features that are scored individually.
Methods
Two hundred consecutive patients seropositive
for anti-HCV by second generation enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (Ortho Diagnos￾tics, New Jersey, USA) undergoing routine
liver biopsy (excluding six further cases serop￾ositive for hepatitis B surface antigen) were
studied. The indication for liver biopsy was the
presence of anti-HCV antibody excluding only
those with contraindications to liver biopsy
such as thrombocytopenia or a prolonged pro￾thrombin time. Other causes of chronic liver
diseases were sought and excluded by clinical,
serological, immunological, and biochemical
criteria. These patients were all from Britain
although they included a small number from
local resident Italian communities. The epide￾miological data were collected on a standard
proforma.
PREPARATION AND EVALUATION OF LIVER BIOPSY
SPECIMENS
All biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% (v/v)
neutral buffered formalin. Tissue sections,
3-4 mm thick, were cut and stained with
haematoxylin and eosin and silver for reticulin
fibres. The histological sections were graded
and staged semiquantitatively by an experi￾enced pathologist based on a modified scoring
system which was similar to other semiquanti￾tative systems," " '1 and is very close to the
recent modification of Knodell."3 The scoring
system takes into account three of the most
common features seen in chronic HCV infec￾tion, namely lymphoid aggregates, bile duct
damage and parenchymal fat.
GRADED FEATURES
Periportal or periseptal interface hepatitis
(piecemeal necrosis): 0 = none; 1 = mild (focal,
few portal areas); 2 = mild/moderate (focal,
most portal tracts). Lobular activity (spotty
necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation): 0
= negligible inflammation; 1 = one focus in
< 2/3 of lobules or nodules; 2 = foci in > 2/3 of
lobules or nodules. Portal inflammation: 0 =
none; 1 = mild, some or all portal areas; 2 =
moderate, some or all portal areas. Lymphoid
aggregates: 0 = none; 1 = occasional only; 2 =
present in most inflamed portal tracts. Bile
duct damage: 0 = absent; 1 = present. Fat: 0 =
none or minimal; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 =
diffuse. Confluent necrosis was encountered so
infrequently that it was not scored individually.
STAGING FEATURES
The fibrosis score has been extended to take
account of the intermediate degrees of fibrosis
seen so frequently in these biopsy specimens.'7
Fibrosis: 0 = none; 1 = confined to portal
tracts; 2 = portal tracts plus spurs radiating
into parenchyma; 3 = linkage of some portal
tracts but intact architecture; 4 = linkage of
most portal tracts with architectural distortion;
5 = cirrhosis.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Values are expressed as mean (SD). The
relation of each of the necro-inflammatory
components to the stage of liver fibrosis was
tested by univariate analysis. These parameters
were analysed by the x2 test for trend utilising
the maximum number of fibrosis categories to
be valid (usually four). Subsequently, fibrosis
was modelled as a continuous variable, by
forward linear regression.'8 The interactions
among portal tract inflammation, lymphoid
aggregates, lobular inflammation, piecemeal
necrosis, bile duct damage, fatty change, and
liver fibrosis were further explored multivari￾ately by hierarchical log linear modelling. This
is a statistical technique that can be used to
produce simple "maps" showing inter-relations
between categorical variables, in particular
whether any two are associated (not necessarily
causally) and if so the strength of the
association (with smaller p values indicating
stronger links).'9 All analyses were done using
sPss software (version 6).
Results
The median age of the 200 patients was 36
years (range 15-77); 56 were women. The

Fibrosis and other histologicalfeatures in chronic HCV infection
probable sources of infection were intravenous
drug use (n = 129, 65%), previous blood
transfusion (n = 33, 17%), contaminated blood
products (haemophiliacs; n = 12, 6%), and
unknown (n = 24, 12%). The median esti￾mated duration of infection (time from expo￾sure to the first risk factor) was 14 years (range
two to 36 years). Sixty patients (30%) had con￾sumed alcohol to excess previously and 38
(19%) still drank to excess at the time of the
liver biopsy (excess as defined by >21 units/
week for men and > 14 units/week for women).
HISTOLOGY
Overall, the histological pattern included all
the described histological categories of chronic
hepatitis: chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic
active hepatitis, chronic lobular hepatitis, and

cirrhosis. No hepatocellular carcinomas were
detected in any of the biopsy specimens. The
frequency of individually assessed histological
features (periportal, portal and lobular inflam￾matory changes) is shown in table 1. Six (3%)
patients had histological features consistent
with dual aetiologies (mainly alcohol).
The most consistent feature was the pres￾ence of portal tract inflammation in 177 (89%)
of 200 samples. Lymphoid aggregates or
follicles in portal tracts were observed either
alone or as part of the general inflammatory
infiltration of the tracts in 120 (60%) samples
(fig 1). The structures varied from simple
aggregations of lymphoid cells to well-formed
follicles with germinal centres. Lobular activity
(in the form of diffuse or focal infiltration by
lymphocytes with or without spotty lytic
necrosis and apoptotic bodies) was found in
154 (77%) samples (fig 2) but was of higher
grade in only 44. Fatty change (macro- and
microvesicular steatosis) was found in 76
(38%) samples and was mild to moderate in 60
(30%) and diffuse in 16 (8%). Significant bile
duct damage was found in only 30 (15%)
specimens. Piecemeal necrosis was present in
79 (40%) samples, although the majority were
mild (53/79). The presence of portal tract
inflammation with lymphoid aggregates or fol￾licles, together with fatty change and/or lobular
activity constitutes a very characteristic and
easily recognisable appearance (fig 1). How￾ever, all four features were found together only
in a small minority of specimens. Thirty one
(16%) patients had stage 0 liver fibrosis, 27
(14%) had stage 1, 69 (35%) had stage 2 (fig
3), 43 (22%) had stage 3, 16 (8%) had stage 4,
and 12 (6%) had stage 5. Thus, 31 patients had
no evidence of fibrosis whilst 12 patients (6%)
had established cirrhosis.

subgroups are shown in table 2. Univariate
analysis of each individual component of
inflammation in relation to fibrosis with x2 test
for trend applied to fibrosis classified as a four
category variable (0 = normal, 1/2 = mild,
3 = moderate, 4/5 = severe) showed a highly
significant association with fibrosis
(p < 0.0005).
MODELLING OF INTERACTIONS
Figure 4 shows the model derived from hierar￾chical log linear analysis of the results. Direct
lines between variables indicates significant
interactions (strengths indicated by p values).
This model reveals that there is a strong
relation between liver fibrosis and piecemeal
necrosis, lobular inflammatory activity (p <
0.001), and fatty change (p < 0.0001). This
last strong relation, between fat and fibrosis,
was not expected. Portal tract inflammation
was strongly correlated with the presence of
lymphoid aggregates or follicles (p < 0.0001),
but this relation might be at least partly

explained by practical difficulties associated
with separately grading these two entities. Not
unexpectedly, the presence of lymphoid aggre￾gates was associated with bile duct damage
(p = 0.001).
Discussion
This prospective study of a series of 200
consecutive liver samples from patients with
chronic HCV infection shows that the presence
of portal tract inflammation with lymphoid
aggregates or follicles, fatty change, lobular
activity including acidophil formation and bile
duct damage form a common histological pat￾tern. This is comparable with other series
which have reported similar findings of lym￾phoid aggregates (45-78%), fatty change (31-
72%) and bile duct damage (22-91%).14-1620-22
Although the degree of inflammatory activity
and liver fibrosis in this series is relatively mild,
a proportion of patients will probably progress
to cirrhosis (12 patients in this series). These
data suggest that the presence of piecemeal
necrosis, fat and lobular inflammation may
identify those at risk of developing fibrosis, but
prospective longitudinal studies must be car￾ried before this can be confirmed.
The single most characteristic feature was
the lymphoid aggregate, which varied from
loose aggregates of lymphocytes to well￾defined structures with germinal centres. They
were easily recognised in reticulin prepara￾tions. Similar follicles are also seen in primary
biliary cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B infec￾tion, but at lesser frequency."5 16 23 24 The pres￾ence of lymphoid follicles in chronic liver
diseases with no obvious cause should alert a
pathologist to the possibility of HCV infection.
The reason for the formation of lymphoid fol￾licles remains obscure but their presence
supports the participation of the patient's
immune system in the pathogenesis of the liver
lesions. Bile duct damage in 16% of patients in
this series is in agreement with published data
of variable frequencies (5-91 %).15 22 The ex￾traordinarily high frequencies (76-91%) re￾ported in two series may mean that those
authors have a lower threshold for the detec￾tion of minor degrees of damage.'5 20 The
mechanism of bile duct injury in chronic HCV
infection is unclear but seems to differ from
other liver diseases that express HIA-DR anti￾gen, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary
sclerosing cholangitis, graft versus host disease,
and allograft rejection. HLA-DR was not
detected in any of 30 liver biopsy specimens
from patients with chronic HCV in a study by
Danque et al.25 The lobular activity in HCV
infection, as observed in this study, tends to be
more focal than in autoimmune hepatitis,'5
which might be compatible with a direct cyto￾pathic effect of HCV,' in contrast to the
immune mediated injury of autoimmune
hepatitis. Fatty change is also a common find￾ing, but whether this is directly related to the
HCV infection or secondary to another predis￾posing factor is not clear.
Fibrosis is the progressive component of the
disease process because it is the fibrous
scarring that leads to architectural distortion

Fibrosis and other histologicalfeatures in chronic HCV infection
and the final irreversible stage of cirrhosis. The
relative importance of the different types of
hepatocellular damage in the pathogenesis of
cirrhosis remains uncertain. Using log linear
analysis of our data, we have developed a
model based on fibrosis demonstrating some
important though not necessarily causal rela￾tions. Overall, the various inflammatory com￾ponents are related to fibrosis but piecemeal
necrosis, lobular inflammation, steatosis, and
portal inflammation are directly linked to
fibrosis (fig 4). This is in accordance with the
concept, in chronic hepatitis in general, that
piecemeal necrosis and bridging necrosis are
associated with progressive disease and a worse
prognosis.26 27 This suggests a possible role for
these changes in the development of fibrosis
and ultimately cirrhosis. The pathology of the
cirrhosis is often not characteristic, but lym￾phoid aggregates and follicles-together with
fatty change-were seen in some of these
patients; hence, this should alert the patholo￾gist to the possibility of HCV infection as in
non-cirrhotic livers.
We recognise the limitations of a single
biopsy specimen. The potential sampling error,
dependent on the size and quality of the
sample, and the fact that the histopathological
changes are part of a dynamic process mean
that the links demonstrated here may not be
causal. Nevertheless, the close inter-relation
between the necro-inflammatory activity and
fibrosis helps us understand the underlying
mechanism in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis in
chronic HCV infection. This is part of an
ongoing study investigating the natural history
of chronic HCV.
