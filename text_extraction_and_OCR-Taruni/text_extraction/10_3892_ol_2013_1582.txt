Abstract. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) has been 
employed to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 
present study aimed to report the treatment effects, the 
dose‑response associations and the factors that are associated 
with radiation‑induced liver disease (RILD) in a high‑dose 
hypofractionated RT procedure. A total of 40 patients with 
non‑metastatic HCC who underwent RT for local control of 
irradiated tumors were studied. The treatment technique was 
that of three‑dimensional conformal or intensity‑modulated 
radiation therapy, with a fraction size of 3 Gy and a total dose 
of 40‑66 Gy in 14‑23 fractions. The biologically‑effective dose 
(BED) was 52.0‑85.8 Gy10 (median, 74.1 Gy10). Tumor regres￾sion was observed in 28 patients (70.0%) with a complete 
response, partial response, stable disease and progressive 
disease status in 11 (27.5%), 17 (42.5%), five (12.5%) and 
seven patients (17.5%), respectively. The one‑, two‑ and 
five‑year overall survival (OS) and in‑field control (IFC) 
rates were 60, 40 and 21% and 73, 62 and 56%, respectively. 
A positive correlation also emerged between the radiation 
dose and the IFC (P=0.035). Eight of the 40 patients (20%) 
developed non‑classic RILD. A higher Cancer of the Liver 
Italian Program score was associated with a higher prob￾ability of non‑classic RILD (P=0.02). The tumor response 
and IFC rate of HCC following irradiation were significantly 
dose‑dependent. High‑dose hypofractionated X‑ray RT is a 
feasible and effective treatment for HCC in patients with good 
liver function and for those who meet the criteria for a cura￾tive attempt.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common 
cancers in Asia, where chronic viral hepatitis is common (1). 
Patients with HCC typically have impaired liver function due 
to virus‑ or alcohol‑induced cirrhosis or viral hepatitis and 
only ~20% are appropriate candidates for surgery (2). The 
five‑year overall survival (OS) rate for patients that are treated 
by surgery is 30‑70% (3). For those who are not treated with 
surgery, liver function affected by an underlying liver disease 
has a strong affect on the clinical outcomes and complicates 
treatment strategies to a greater extent than for other tumors. 
Maximal preservation of the normal liver volume and function 
is a significant consideration in the choice of treatment. 
Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) and radio￾frequency ablation (RFA) are two major non‑surgical local 
treatments for HCC. PEIT is often used for small HCCs. 
Higher local failure rates have been identified in patients 
with tumors of >3 cm that have been treated by PEIT, or in 
those with more than three tumors (4). RFA, which is able to 
treat tumors of ≤5 cm, has a more efficient local control rate 
than PEIT for small tumors (5). However, RFA is difficult 
to perform in patients with anatomically unfavorable tumor 
locations or coagulopathy, as is commonly observed in HCC 
patients. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), 
although not considered a curative treatment, is used in 
patients with poor liver function or those who are not suitable 
candidates for RFA or PEIT. A systemic review of randomized 
trials has shown that TACE improves the survival of patients 
with unresectable HCC (6).
Radiotherapy (RT) has not been widely adopted as a cura￾tive treatment modality for HCC due to poor liver tolerance 
from radiation damage. Improvements in RT techniques, 
including three‑dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT), inten￾sity‑modulated RT (IMRT) and image‑guided RT (IGRT), 
provide multiple treatment portals with a reduced volume of 
liver subjected to high‑dose therapy and improved conformity 
and precision. These techniques increase the prescribed dose 
and local‑control likelihood with acceptable liver toxicity (7).

has facilitated the employment of hypofractionated RT. A 
large fraction of HCC was used in proton beam therapy as 
the normal liver dose may be reduced by its physical char￾acteristic (8). For X‑ray, a large fraction size for primary or 
metastatic liver tumors is provided through stereotactic body 
RT (9), and clinical trials are being conducted (10).
The present study investigated the use of X‑rays with a 
moderate hypofractionation schema to achieve local control 
of the irradiated tumor in the treatment of HCC patients. The 
schema was 3 Gy/fraction, with a maximal total dose of up to 
60‑66 Gy if the liver tolerance was acceptable. The total dose 
of this schema was between the conventional fraction size of 
2 Gy and the large fraction size provided by stereotactic body 
radiosurgery.
Materials and methods
Patients. The study procedure conformed to the ethical 
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approval for 
the study was obtained from the institution's human research 
committee (nos. 99‑1,924B). Between January 1998 and 
January 2008, medical records were reviewed for 40 patients 
with non‑metastatic HCC who underwent high‑dose RT, with 
attention to local tumor control. All the patients were treated 
with 3DCRT or IMRT and were administered a total radiation 
dose of >50 Gy10. The patients who were diagnosed with HCC 
and administered RT of a biologically‑effective dose (BED) 
of >50 Gy10 using the α/β ratio of 10 Gy were selected for the 
present study. 
Table I provides a summary of the characteristics of the 
40 patients, consisting of 10 males and 30 females, with 
a median age of 63 years (range, 42‑82 years). A total of 
32 (80.0%) patients presented with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 
15 (37.5%) had a history of esophageal variceal (EV) bleeding. 
Of the 40 patients, 25 (62.5%) had Child‑Pugh class A (11) LC 
and 23 patients (57.5%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0‑1. The previous 
treatments of the 28 patients who were administered RT as a 
salvage treatment are as follows: Surgery in one patient, TACE 
in 23, RFA in two, PEIT in 11 and oral chemotherapy in one. 
The distribution of patients with a Cancer of the Liver Italian 
program (CLIP) (12) score of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 was six, 13, 13, six 
and two patients, respectively. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) 
was present in 13 patients (32.5%).
Radiation therapy. The patients were immobilized in a 
supine position using a vacuum bag with their arms elevated 
overhead. Contrast‑enhanced images were used for target 
delineation and dynamic computed tomography (CT) was 
performed as required for tumor identification. The CT 
images that were captured subsequent to 2007 were obtained 
by respiration‑gating or 4D techniques. The delineation of the 
gross tumor volume (GTV) accounted for the organ motion in 
the 4D CT. The clinical tumor volume (CTV) was obtained by 
adding a 5‑10‑mm expansion from the GTV, and the expan￾sion of the planning tumor volume (PTV) was typically 5 mm 
for the lateral directions, 0.5‑1 cm for the anterior‑posterior 
direction and 0.5‑1.5 cm for the cephalic‑caudal direction. 
The PTV extension depended on 4D or respiratory‑gating CT 
and whether imaged‑guided or respiratory gating was used in

the treatment. Of the 40 patients, 15 (37.5%), 7 (17.5%) and 
18 (45.0%) patients underwent 3DCRT, IMRT and 4D plan￾ning RT, respectively.
The prescribed dose was defined as a 100% and 95%, 
which applied to the CTV and PTV, respectively. The total 
dose was adjusted by considering the liver tolerance dose with 
the restriction that <30% of normal liver received >30 Gy 
(V30) and the dose restriction was reduced to 27 Gy (V27) for 
those with Child‑Pugh class B disease. The median fraction 
size was 3 Gy/fraction and the radiation dose was 40‑66 Gy 
in 14‑23 fractions (BED of 52.0‑85.8 Gy10 using the α/β ratio 
of 10 Gy; median, 74.1 Gy10). The fraction size was reduced to 
2‑2.5 Gy if the bowel was included in the PTV. The median of 
the mean liver dose for all the patients was 2,062 cGy (range, 
1,008‑2,415 cGy). The median of V30 for all the patients was 
24% (range, 12‑35%).
Follow‑up. The patient cases were followed‑up at least every 
three months by CT or ultrasonography during the first year 
and every six months for up to three years thereafter. The 
follow‑up imaging studies were compared with those that 
were taken prior to RT and the most significant change in 
tumor size was regarded as the treatment response. The radio￾graphical tumor response following RT was evaluated using 
the World Health Organization criteria (13). In‑field failure 
(IFF) was defined as tumor regrowth within the current RT 
field. Intrahepatic recurrence outside the RT field was defined 
as an intrahepatic failure (IHF). Distant metastasis (DM) was 
defined as any recurrence outside the liver.
Classic radiation‑induced liver disease (RILD) was defined 
by the presence of anicteric ascites and the elevation of alka￾line phosphatase levels to at least a two‑fold increase over the 
pre‑treatment values in the absence of tumor progression. The 
end-point (occurrence of classic RILD) occurred in patients 
with good liver function. Non‑classic RILD was defined as 
the elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels to more than five 
times the upper limit of normal or a decline in liver function 
(measured by a worsening of the Child‑Pugh score by two or 
more). The end‑point was described in patients with poor liver 
function (virus hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension 
and Child‑Pugh Classes B and C) (14).
Statistics. A univariate cox regression analysis was performed 
to evaluate the prognostic factors and a multivariate analysis 
was performed with the forward stepwise procedure using 
a multiple Cox regression analysis. Survival and IFC were 
estimated from the first date of RT and the OS rates, and IFC 
rates were estimated using the Kaplan‑Meier method. The 
Cox regression model was used to investigate the correlation 
between BED and the IFC. Fisher's exact test and the logistic 
regression model were also used to evaluate the correlation 
between the presence of non‑classic RILD and the CLIP score. 
P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant 
difference.
Results
Failure pattern and survival. The failure pattern following a 
minimum of a two‑year follow‑up period is shown in Fig. 1. 
IFF, IHF and DM were observed in 12, 15 and eight patients, 
respectively, and 10 patients experienced more than one type 
of recurrence. Following a median follow‑up time of 7.7 years 
for the surviving patients, the one‑, two‑ and five‑year OS rates 
were 60, 40 and 21%, respectively (Fig. 2A). OS was signifi￾cantly affected by the ECOG performance status (P=0.012), 
the Child‑Pugh classification (P=0.003), the presence of 
LC (P=0.020), the CLIP score (P=0.001) and the tumor 
number (P=0.021) in the univariate analysis (Table II). The 
multivariate analysis showed that Child‑Pugh classification 
(Child‑Pugh class B vs. A: HR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.27‑12.95; 
P<0.0001) and the tumor number (multiple vs. single: HR, 
4.68; 95% CI, 2.08‑10.53; P<0.0001) were the most significant 
factors affecting OS. The one‑, two‑ and five‑year IFC were 
72.7, 61.6 and 56.0%, respectively (Fig. 2B). As shown by the 
univariate analysis, the factors that were associated with IFC 
included the tumor number (P=0.026), treatment response and 
BED (≥60 Gy10 vs. <60 Gy10, P=0.021; ≥55 Gy10 vs. <55 Gy10; 
P=0.001) (Table II). The multivariate analysis revealed that 
the treatment response (responder vs. non‑responder: HR, 
0.27; 95% CI, 0.09‑0.83; P=0.023) and BED (≥55 Gy10 vs. 
<55 Gy10: HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05‑0.55; P=0.023) were the 
most significant factors for IFC. The one‑, two‑ and five‑year 
intrahepatic control (IHC) and distant‑metastasis free survival 
(DMFS) were 65.4, 56.3 and 41.7% and 79.8, 75.3 and 75.3%, 
respectively. No factors associated with IHC were identified. 
The treatment response alone affected the DMFS (P=0.032) in 
the univariate analysis.
Tumor response. Of the 40 patients, 11 (27.5%) achieved a 
complete response (CR) following RT and a partial response 
(PR) was noted in 17 (42.5%) patients. The overall response 
rate was 70.0%. Stable disease (SD) was observed in five 
patients (12.5%) and progressive disease (PD) in seven patients 
(17.5%) (Table III). A positive correlation trend existed 
between the radiation dose and the tumor response. A higher 
BED indicated a higher probability of IFC. Using the Cox 
regression model, the estimated two‑year IFC rates for a BED 
of <60 Gy10, 60‑70 Gy10 and >70 Gy10 were 43, 55 and 70%, 
respectively (P=0.035). 
Toxicity. Eight of the 40 patients (20%) were noted to experi￾ence a deterioration of the Child‑Pugh score by two or more. 
The median time of non‑classic RILD occurrence from RT 
completion was 39.5 days (range, 15‑85 days). Among the

patients who developed non‑classic RILD, one (12.5%), 
five (62.5%) and two (25%) demonstrated CR, PR and PD, 
respectively. Six of the eight patients with non‑classic RILD 
exhibited ascites and an increased serum total bilirubin level. 
Using the logistic regression model, the estimated probability 
of non‑classic RILD for CLIP scores 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 3, 
8.2, 21, 43.9 and 69.8%, respectively (P=0.02). A higher CLIP 
score was associated with a higher probability of non‑classic 
RILD. A positive association between BED to the tumor and 
non‑classic RILD was not identified by the dose constraints. 
The probability of non‑classic RILD did not increase when 
the BED to the tumor increased. However, the mean liver dose 
for the patients who developed RILD was significantly higher 
than that for the non‑RILD patients (2,322 cGy vs. 1764 cGy; 
P=0.048). Classic RILD was not noted in any patients. One 
patient had a duodenal ulcer confirmed by panendoscopy. The 
patient who developed the duodenal ulcer underwent 3DCRT 
with a dose of 54 Gy in 18 fractions to PTV and the ulcer 
location was in the 90‑95% isodose region.
Discussion
RT by X‑ray is not routinely used in the curative treatment 
of HCC. However, HCC has been observed to be more 
radiosensitive than was previously believed (15). The major 
limitation has been the poor radiation tolerance of the adjacent 
normal liver. The first study of the correlation between the 
dose and complication rate for whole‑liver RT was reported 
by Ingold et al, who demonstrated that the RILD incidence 
was 12.5 and 44% for patients who were treated with 30‑35 Gy 
and >35 Gy whole liver RT, respectively (16). In a Radiation 
Therapy Oncology Group study for liver metastasis, no RILD 
was observed in patients who were administered 30 Gy whole 
liver irradiation provided by 1.5 Gy/per fraction in two factions 
per day (17). Lawrence et al (18) revealed that a higher radia￾tion dose (30 Gy whole liver irradiation with a 15 or 30 Gy 
boost) resulted in a higher tumor response than whole liver 
RT alone (64% for the boost group and 39% for whole liver 
RT alone). In addition, it has been shown that the tolerance for 
liver irradiation may be 35 Gy for the whole liver, 42 Gy for 
70% of the liver, 52 Gy for 50% of the liver and 70 Gy for 30% 
of the liver (19).
Dawson et al (20) showed that liver doses associated 
with a 5% risk of RILD for uniform irradiation of one‑third, 
two‑thirds and the whole liver were 90, 47 and 31 Gy, respec￾tively. Advancements in RT technology have created the 
possibility of delivering a higher local radiation dose to the 
liver tumor. A positive correlation between radiation dose 
and tumor response was observed by Park et al (21). The 
response rates for doses of <40, 40‑50 and >50 Gy were 29, 69 
and 77%, respectively. The dose response was established in 
<50 Gy radiation. A PR was observed in 90% of patients with 
tumors of <5 cm, but only in 60% of those with tumors >5 cm. 
Park et al (7) showed that the IFF rate was 46.7 vs. 16.9% 
for patients treated with doses of ≤50 Gy10 and >50 Gy10, and 
concluded that a BED of 50 Gy10 was a criterion for an effective 
radiation dose. Liu et al (22) showed that an improved OS rate 
was correlated with the dose delivered to the tumor, particu￾larly for doses of >50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy per fraction). Although 
previous studies have shown that the radiation dose and tumor 
size affect the treatment results, only a specific dose obtains an 
enhanced tumor response. 
All 40 patients in the present study were administered a 
greater radiation dose of 52.0‑85.8 Gy10 with a median BED 
of 74.1 Gy10, showing a positive correlation between the 
radiation dose and tumor response. A higher BED indicated a 
higher probability of a tumor response. In addition, a BED of 
≥55 Gy10 was significantly associated with an improved IFC 
rate. The results show this schema is feasible for HCC curative 
treatment and that a dose‑response correlation exists for tumor 
control. 
The corresponding BED for the hypofractionated RT 
schema was 52.0‑85.8 Gy10 using the α/β ratio of 10 Gy 
(median, 74.1 Gy10). The doses published from 3DCRT 
with conventional fractionation for HCC were between 
33 and 66 Gy (23). A wide range of response (55‑92%), 
one‑year local control (61‑78%) and one‑year OS (43‑61%) 
rates were reported for these doses. Studies have reported 
similar results to the present treatment strategy with a frac￾tion size of 3‑6 Gy/fx, a total dose of 38‑68 Gy (24,25), a 
55‑70% response rate, a 73‑85% one‑year local control rate 
and a 60‑100% one‑year OS rate. Stereotactic body radio￾therapy (SBRT) with a diversified fractionation schema 
showed a 65‑100% one‑year local control rate and a 48‑93% 
one‑year OS rate (9,26). However, stringent patient‑selection 
criteria for liver function, tumor location, tumor size and 
the high‑technique demand limit the routine use of SBRT. 
The present data and data from other published studies have 
shown that high‑dose hypofractionated conformal RT is 
feasible and yields an improved local control compared with 
3DCRT conventional fractionation.
Although higher‑dose RT for HCC is achievable with 
careful patient selection and an improved radiation technique, 
RILD remains a significant complication. Data from Western 
countries indicate that a mean liver dose of 28 Gy in 2‑Gy/fx 
is associated with a 5% risk of classic RILD, which is char￾acterized by fatigue, weight gain, increased abdominal girth, 
hepatomegaly, anicteric ascites and an isolated elevation in 
alkaline phosphatase that is out of proportion with the other 
liver enzymes (27). For the HCC patients in regions with 
endemic viral infection, the tolerance dose for RILD was 
shown to be lower and HBV infection predisposed patients 
to RILD, particularly for non‑classic RILD presenting with 
jaundice or markedly elevated serum transaminases of more 
than five times the upper limit of the reference range (28,29). 
Radiation was shown to induce HBV reactivation, possibly 
through the bystander effect, and non‑classic RILD further 
complicated the RILD for viral hepatitis‑related HCC (30,31).
Eight of the 40 patients in the present study developed 
non‑classic RILD, six of whom had viral hepatitis under the 
liver‑dose constraints of V30 <30%. The most significant 
prognostic factor for non‑classic RILD was a high CLIP score. 
Previous studies have shown that in addition to a normal liver 
dose and HBV carrier status, the underlying liver function 
is also a significant predictive factor for RILD (32,33). The 
Child‑Pugh classification has often been used to evaluate liver 
reserve in cirrhosis patients. The present study revealed that 
the CLIP score, assigning points for the Child‑Pugh score, 
the tumor morphology (solitary, ≤50% of the liver, massive), 
the serum α‑fetoprotein level and the presence or absence of 

HUANG et al: RADIOTHERAPY FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA 1519
PVT (12), not only serve as prognostic factors for the survival 
of HCC patients (34,35), but that they also strongly correlate 
with RILD incidence.
In the spectrum of local‑regional therapy for HCC, the 
percentage of good surgical candidates for resection is ~20% 
and the five‑year survival rate following surgery is ~50%. RFA 
results in five‑year survival rates of 50%, with up to 20% recur￾rence rates for larger tumors. However, the result is often limited 
by the size and location of the tumor. For patients with large 
or multifocal tumors, TACE offers survival benefits compared 
with the best supportive treatment alone (36‑38). However, the 
five‑year survival rate is <2% and the recurrence rate is nearly 
100%. In the present study, ~40% of patients had Child‑Pugh 
class B liver cirrhosis and >75% had viral hepatitis. The tumors 
in the majority of the patients (70%) failed to respond to previous 
local‑regional therapies and were recurrent multiple HCCs of 
a moderate size. Within this patient population, the strategy 
resulted in a five‑year IFC rate of 56% and a five‑year OS rate 
of 20.6%. The present study shows that this strategy achieves 
long‑term survival and good local control in certain patients.
In summary, the present study showed that high‑dose 
hypofractionated RT is a feasible and effective treatment for 
HCC. A positive correlation was identified between the radia￾tion dose and IFC. It was shown that a higher BED indicates a 
higher probability of IFC. The baseline liver function and the 
CLIP score should also be evaluated carefully to avoid RILD.
