Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) assessment has been shown to
be a challenge for healthcare professionals, leading to the devel￾opment of the eGVHD App (www.uzleuven.be/egvhd). In this
study, we formally evaluated the accuracy of using the App compared
to traditional assessment methods to assess GvHD. Our national mul￾ticenter randomized controlled trial involved seven Belgian transplan￾tation centers and 78 healthcare professionals selected using a 2-stage
convenience sampling approach between January and April 2017.
Using a 1:1 randomization stratified by profession, healthcare profes￾sionals were assigned to use either the App (“APP”) or their usual
GvHD assessment aids (“No APP”) to assess the diagnosis and severity
score of 10 expert-validated clinical vignettes. Our main outcome
measure was the difference in accuracy for GvHD severity scoring
between both groups. The odds of being correct were 6.14 (95%CI:
2.83-13.34) and 6.29 (95%CI: 4.32-9.15) times higher in favor of the
“APP” group for diagnosis and scoring, respectively (P<0.001). App￾assisted GvHD severity scoring was significantly superior for both
acute and chronic GvHD, with an Odds Ratio of 17.89 and 4.34 respec￾tively (P<0.001) and showed a significantly increased inter-observer
agreement compared to standard practice. Despite a mean increase of
24 minutes (95%CI: 20.45-26.97) in the time needed to score the whole
GvHD test package in the “APP” group (P<0.001), usability feedback
was positive. The eGVHD App shows superior GvHD assessment
accuracy compared to standard practice and has the potential to
improve the quality of outcome data registration in allogeneic stem cell
transplantation.

ABSTRACT

Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) refers to the reaction of
the transplanted immune system against the recipient’s tis￾sues. This pleiotropic disease affects up to half of patients
after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HCT) and can damage any organ system to various
degrees. It is by far the most debilitating complication of
HCT, considering its major impact on morbidity and mor￾tality.1
Yet because of the lack of widely available GvHD bio￾markers, the assessment of the presence and severity of
GvHD still relies mainly on the clinical evaluation of multi￾ple organs according to a relatively complex algorithm.
Moreover, the recommendations underlying this evaluation
are plethoric and sometimes even contradictory, potentially
leading to confusion in the HCT community.1 In fact, it has
been repeatedly shown that many HCT professionals have
problems implementing GvHD assessment correctly, as
demonstrated by a low observed accuracy in GvHD assess￾ment2-5 and a slow uptake of the most up-to-date
guidelines.5-7
The eGVHD App is an electronic tool that we developed
in collaboration with the European Group for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Transplantation
Complications Working Party and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) to assist healthcare professionals with their
GvHD assessment.4 This tool is a web application, available
on mobile devices and desktop computers (see www.uzleu￾ven.be/egvhd for a complete list of the App’s characteristics).
It allows intuitive and user-friendly access to the most
recent international consensus guidelines and assists the
user by automatically executing the required algorithm to
calculate the severity of GvHD, once the relevant clinical
characteristics have been entered.
Pilot testing was promising, suggesting improved GvHD
assessment and good usability.4,5 Therefore, the primary
aim of the present study was to compare the accuracy of
the severity score of validated GvHD case-vignettes per￾formed by healthcare professionals using the “eGVHD
App” (“APP” group) with standard practice (“No APP”
group). Secondary aims were to understand the characteris￾tics that might affect the difference in accuracy between
both groups and to compare the inter-observer variability in
GvHD scoring results, as well as the time needed to per￾form the GvHD evaluation of the full test package in both
groups. We also assessed current practice patterns in GvHD
assessment for all participants and post-test user satisfac￾tion and experience in the “APP” group, to allow the tool’s
usability to be further improved. To evaluate the generaliz￾ability of the tool, we tested the eGVHD App in a variety
of settings and with a wide range of healthcare practitioners
with different professional backgrounds.
We hypothesized that the eGVHD App would improve
GvHD assessment by improving the accuracy of GvHD
severity scoring by healthcare professionals and reducing
inter-rater variability in scoring results, without increasing
the time required to assess GvHD. 
Methods
Design
This study used a hybrid design (Figure 1). The first part of the
study consisted of a 2-group multicenter randomized controlled
trial assigning healthcare professionals 1:1 to an intervention group
(“APP”) or a control group (“No APP”) to evaluate the accuracy of
GvHD assessment. The second part of the study was observation￾al and described current practice patterns in GvHD assessment
(“Survey 1”) and usability aspects linked to the use of the App
(“Survey 2”). 
Sample and setting
All Belgian hospitals performing allogeneic HCT were invited to
participate (Online Supplementary Table S1) to optimize sample size
and generalizability. Centers were selected on their willingness to
organize a GvHD workshop on their own premises within the
allocated timeframe (from January to April 2017). Healthcare pro￾fessionals employed or studying at each participating hospital
were recruited by convenience sampling. They were included pro￾vided they attended the workshop (see Online Supplementary
Methods for workshop details) and could recall having performed
at least one GvHD evaluation in the past 12 months.
Information concerning data collection points, randomization
procedure and blinding are available in the Online Supplementary
Methods. 
Outcome measures
The primary aim was to assess the difference in accuracy for
GvHD severity scoring between the “APP” and “No APP” groups.
(See Online Supplementary Methods for the planned sub-analyses.) 
Variables and measurements
Demographics and practice patterns in GvHD assessment: a self￾report questionnaire (“Survey 1”) captured participant characteris￾tics (Table 1) as well as practice pattern in GvHD assessment and
pre-test technology access and acceptance data (Table 2) at base￾line. 
Accuracy of GvHD assessment: participants were required to diag￾nose and score a package of 10 randomly ordered GvHD clinical
vignettes based on real-life clinical cases (see Online Supplementary
Methods and Online Supplementary Table S2) according to the most
up-to-date international guidelines.1 Four acute GvHD (aGvHD)
vignettes covered the two types of aGvHD diagnosis (‘classic
aGvHD’ and ‘late aGvHD’, two vignettes each) and the four
aGvHD overall severity stages (I-IV, one vignette per stage),
according to the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International
Consortium (MAGIC) criteria.8 Six chronic GvHD (cGvHD)
vignettes covered the two cGvHD diagnoses (‘overlap cGvHD’
and ‘classic cGvHD’, two and four vignettes, respectively) and the
three severity grades of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
2014 criteria9 (two vignettes per severity level, i.e. mild, moderate
and severe). Answers were given by participants using a multiple
choice form offering the following mutually exclusive options for
diagnosis (‘classic aGvHD’, ‘late aGvHD’, ‘overlap cGvHD’ or
‘classic cGvHD’) and scoring (‘grade I’, ‘grade II’, ‘grade III’, ‘grade
IV’, ‘Mild’, ‘Moderate’ or ‘Severe’), respectively.
The individual answer of each participant was compared to the
gold standard (see Online Supplementary Methods) and scored as
‘correct’ (if the answer corresponded exactly to the expert evalua￾tion) or ‘incorrect’ (for any other answer, including missing
answers) for diagnosis and severity scoring, respectively (Online
Supplementary Table S3). The total number of correctly evaluated
vignettes for the whole GvHD test package was also recorded per
individual (score ranging from 0 to 10 correct answers), for diagno￾sis and scoring separately. The time needed to complete the full
GvHD test package was recorded for each participant individually
by study staff.
Control group: participants randomized to standard practice (“No
APP” control group) were allowed to use any of their usual meth￾Impact of the eGVHD App on GvHD assessment
haematologica | 2018; 103(10) 1699

ods to assess GvHD: their own knowledge, ‘fast facts’ sheets, scor￾ing sheets, standard operating procedures, copies of original guide￾line publications, or any other chosen resource. 
Intervention Group: participants randomized to the “APP” group
received the eGVHD App as a stand-alone GvHD assessment aid.
Post-test user satisfaction and experience: post-test user satisfaction
and experience was recorded in “APP” users only by “Survey 2”
using a semi-structured self-report questionnaire, and two validated
instruments, the “perceived usefulness” subscale of the technology
acceptance model (TAM) and the Post-Study System Usability
Questionnaire (PSSUQ), as described previously4 (see Online
Supplementary Methods and Online Supplementary Table S4 for details). 
Statistical analysis 
For details of the statistical analysis see the Online Supplementary
Methods. 
Results
Seven out of the eleven Belgian allogeneic HCT centers
participated in the study (response rate 64%). They were
essentially academic centers, covering together more than
80% of the Belgian allogenic transplantation activity (Online
Supplementary Table S1). 
A total of 103 individuals participated in the workshops
(Figure 2). Seventy-eight professionals met the inclusion cri￾teria and were randomized. One participant dropped-out
due to a medical emergency in the clinic, hence data from
77 professionals were available for analysis: 37 in the “APP”
Group and 40 in the “No APP” group. There was a median
of 8 participants per center (range: 7-20) (Online
Supplementary Table S1). Professional characteristics were
similar in both groups (Table 1). The majority of partici￾pants were medical doctors (75%), female (64%), and had
a median age of 39 years (IQR: 20, range 22-62).
Professionals reported a median experience in allogeneic
HCT of six years (IQR: 11, range 0-32), and evaluated a
median of one allogeneic HCT patient for GvHD per week
(IQR: 5, range 0-30). The majority of healthcare profession￾als reported having expertise in adult patient care. Self￾reported proficiency in English was high with a median
score of 7 (IQR: 1; range: 2-10) on a Likert scale of 1 (not at
all fluent) to 10 (extremely fluent).

Pre-test user current standard practice and technology
access/acceptance
The Glucksberg10 and the NIH 2014 criteria9 were the
most frequently referenced GvHD assessment guidelines
being used in clinical practice as reported by healthcare pro￾fessionals (Table 2). Most professionals reported basing
their usual GvHD evaluation on their own knowledge (n=
44, 57%), the NIH 2014 GvHD evaluation sheet9 (n=17,
22%), and/or a self-designed scoring paper document
(n=16, 21%). The use of standard criteria to assess GvHD
was reported as important (median score of 7 on a Likert
scale of 1 to 10, IQR: 4, range 1-10), but performed with a
relatively low level of confidence (median score of 5 on a
Likert scale of 1 to 10, IQR: 4, range 1-9). The top four
GvHD assessment problems spontaneously reported were:
lack of knowledge or experience (n=23), time constraints
(n=16), lack of data in the medical files (n=7), and the com￾plexity of the guidelines (n=5). 
During the workshop, the “No APP” group planned to
rely essentially on their own knowledge (n=24, 62%), the
NIH 2014 GvHD evaluation sheet9 (n=9, 23%), the NIH
2005 GvHD evaluation sheet11 (n=6, 15%), a self-designed
scoring document (n=6, 15%), and/or other methods (n=7,
18%) (Table 2).
Accuracy of GvHD assessment
The total number of correctly evaluated clinical vignettes
was higher in the “APP” group compared to the “No APP”
group (Table 3). More specifically, participants in the “APP”
group had a median of 10 correct answers for diagnosis
(IQR 1; range 5-10), compared to a median of 6.5 (IQR 3;
range 2-9) in the “No APP” group for the whole GvHD test
package (the maximum obtainable score was 10). For sever￾ity assessment, the “APP” group scored a median of 9
vignettes correctly (IQR 2; range 2-10) compared to a medi￾an of 4.5 (IQR 3; range 1-7) in the “No APP” group.
Individual results for each vignette are shown in Online
Supplementary Table S3. As a result, the odds of being correct
were 6.14 (95%CI: 2.83-13.34) and 6.29 (95%CI: 4.32-9.15)
times higher in favor of the “APP” group for diagnosis and
scoring, respectively (P<0.001). 
All pre-specified sub-analyses were performed as
planned. The GvHD assessment of the “APP” group
remained superior for both acute and chronic GvHD sepa￾rately with a significantly stronger effect in acute GvHD
(OR=17.89, 95%CI: 8.47-37.79) compared to chronic
GvHD (OR=4.34, 95%CI: 2.79-6.74) (P<0.001), and for all
levels of severity scoring, except for aGvHD grade I. The
effect of the App was more apparent for higher levels of
severity (P=0.034) for both aGvHD and cGvHD. The
strength of the effect did not significantly depend on center
(Online Supplementary Figure S1) or professional background
(Online Supplementary Figure S2). Similarly, neither the age of
user (Online Supplementary Figure S3), the number of GvHD
patients seen per week (Online Supplementary Figure S4), or
self-reported comfort with using GvHD guidelines (Online
Supplementary Figure S5) seemed to mitigate the superior
performance of the “APP” group. 
Agreement between participant results and the expert
gold standard diagnosis and severity scoring are highlighted
in the diagonal of Tables 4 and 5, showing the superior per￾formance of the “APP” group. For diagnosis, the most con￾sistent errors of the “No APP” group were seen for case￾vignettes relating to ‘Overlap cGvHD’ and ‘Late aGvHD’,
which both tended to be confused with ‘Classic cGvHD’.
The highest discrepancies between the “No APP” group
and expert acute GvHD severity scoring results were seen
in ‘grade II’ (which tended to be graded according to the
cGvHD criteria) and ‘grade IV’ aGvHD (which was essen￾tially mistaken for ‘grade III’). Inconsistencies in chronic
GvHD severity scoring were seen across all grades. The
most frequent error in the “APP” group was a slight overes￾Impact of the eGVHD App on GvHD assessment

timation of the cGvHD grade (overestimation n=34, 15%;
underestimation n=20, 9%; missing/other n=4, 2%) with￾out any misclassification, whereas the “No APP” group
tended to evaluate cGvHD severity erroneously according
to the aGvHD criteria (n=62, 25%), without bias for sever￾ity (overestimation n=36, 14%; underestimation n=36,
15%; missing/other n=7, 3%). 
Consequently, inter-observer agreement of the severity
score was higher in the “APP” group compared to standard
practice: the probability that 2 HCT professionals agreed on
the GvHD score equaled 0.73 and 0.56 in the “App” and
“No APP” group, respectively. The chance-corrected agree￾ment was significantly higher in the “APP” group (κBP= 0.46,
95%CI: 0.23-0.68) compared to the “No APP” group (κBP
=0.12, 95%CI: 0.03-0.21) (P=0.003). 
The time needed to complete the total test package was
significantly higher in the “APP” group compared to the
standard practice group, with a mean time of 48.84 minutes
to complete all ten clinical vignettes in the “APP” group ver￾sus 25.27 minutes in the “No APP” group (P<0.001) (Table
3). 
Post-test user satisfaction and experience
No major technical issues were identified. Both “per￾ceived usefulness” and “system usability” were considered
to be good, as shown in Online Supplementary Table S4.
Users reported being likely to use the eGVHD App in their
daily practice and did not experience any issues with using
the App in English. Spontaneously reported positive aspects
of the eGVHD App were its clarity, ease of use, and its sys￾tematic approach. Users suggested some potential improve￾ments, such as decreasing its time-consuming components,
reducing the number of evaluated items, and clarifying
some specific terms in more detail. 
Discussion
Several groups have recently advocated the use of elec￾tronic tools to improve GvHD assessment, albeit without
providing formal proof of their efficacy.1,4,12-14 In this rigorous
multi-center randomized trial, we unequivocally demon￾strate that the accuracy of GvHD assessment of clinical
vignettes by healthcare professionals is significantly higher
when using the eGVHD App compared to standard prac￾tice. This effect was seen for both acute and chronic GvHD,
across all severity levels (except for aGvHD grade I) and all
degrees of experience and professional backgrounds, with￾out any evidence for center effect. 
In this study, participants in the control group were
allowed to use any method of their choice to support their
GvHD assessment, except for using the eGVHD App. Yet
GvHD assessment results in the “APP” group, were striking￾ly better. We believe that the superior performance of the
App users could be due to a number of factors. First, App
users were provided with the most up-to-date guidelines,1
without having to look them up actively. Second, similar to
using comprehensive paper data collection forms, they
were encouraged to work in a systematic fashion: they had
to evaluate every possible aspect of acute or chronic GvHD
(to avoid overlooking less intuitive aspects of the disease) in
order to select the appropriate scoring system and come to
the correct severity evaluation result. Finally, the digital
interface also offered users a number of advantages such as
the presence of pictures and definitions to support recogni￾tion of GvHD-related features, the use of ‘skip-logic’ princi￾ples (which allows healthcare professionals to avoid wast￾ing time on filling in information with no direct impact on
diagnosis or severity scoring), the automatic computation
of the resulting score, and the option of generating a report.
We have to acknowledge that this superior performance
was achieved at the cost of a significant increase in the time
needed to score clinical vignettes, with an excess of approx￾imately 24 minutes to score the ten clinical vignettes com￾pared to using standard methods. This was partially due to
the fact that “APP” users needed to get used to a tool they
had never worked with before. Yet healthcare professionals
remained open to the use of eHealth technology, both
before and after actually using the App. The eGVHD App
showed excellent usability, as no major technical issues
were noted and user feedback was widely positive, suggest￾ing a potential for optimal dissemination and uptake in the
HCT community. Furthermore, in the event where the
App-computed scores would be directly transferred into the
electronic health record (eHR), the additional time spent
inputting data into the App would be rewarded with poten￾tially less time charting, and more accurate data collection.
However, this integration also presupposes a number of
basic pre-requisites, which still need to be developed: data
cleaning methods to ensure the quality of data entry, the
possibility of crosstalk between the eGVHD App and the
different eHR systems, the reliability, privacy and safety of
data transfer, and the option of identifying the individual
who performed the data input.
Consistent with prior literature, our practice pattern sur￾vey showed the lack of consensus in the HCT community
as to which set of international recommendations should
be used to assess GvHD, and confirmed numerous barriers
to their successful dissemination and implementation.5-7

The lack of consensus and knowledge of the most recent
guidelines was perhaps due to the low number of HCT
patients seen per week, and probably partly explains the
lower results obtained by the group using traditional meth￾ods. However, this also highlights the need to standardize
GvHD evaluation within the HCT community, as recently
advocated by a panel of GvHD experts.1 It is precisely in
this context of lack of confidence and expertise in GvHD
assessment that e-Tools, such as the eGVHD App, have the
potential to increase the quality of data collection by allow￾ing easy, reliable, user-friendly and intuitive access to the
most up-to-date guidelines to any healthcare professional.
Regrettably, we were unable to test the effect of the App
specifically in smaller Belgian centers, as they declined the
invitation to participate in this study. We are, therefore,
unable to speculate on the generalizability of this tool in
centers with lower transplantation volumes. 
The limited number of vignettes also makes it challenging
to make any meaningful conclusions on specific subgroups
or at the organ level. The significant difference in improved
accuracy for aGvHD scoring compared to cGvHD scoring is
probably simply due to the fact that each of the four
aGvHD severity levels was evaluated by a single clinical
vignette (instead of two per severity level for cGvHD). For
instance, in the ‘late acute GvHD grade II’ clinical vignette,
the largely incorrect final severity evaluation reported by
the “No APP” group was partially conditioned by the fact
that the distinction between acute and chronic GvHD had
not been made in the first place. Moreover, the MAGIC cri￾teria were not the standard reference for aGvHD for the
majority of the participants, which could explain the excep￾tionally poor results for the grade IV aGvHD vignette when
evaluated by the “No APP” group. 
The limited number of observations also restrict our abil￾ity to draw any conclusions on the potential impact of using
the App in the clinical setting to decide upon starting treat￾ment, as the threshold to start therapy is linked to much
broader categories than the ones described above (typically,
any grade above or equal to ‘aGvHD grade II’ or ‘cGvHD
moderate’ would qualify for treatment, depending on the
general health status of the patient15-17). Treatment adap￾tions rely also on specific response criteria,18,19 which were
not investigated in this project. Future studies, therefore,
need to evaluate the use and impact of the eGVHD App in
the clinic. This will also allow the evaluation of the App in
situations where the patient does not present with GvHD,
considering that the test package studied here only evaluat￾ed the tool in the context of GvHD-afflicted patients, pre￾cluding the evaluation of detection measures such as predic￾tive values, sensitivity and specificity. 
Further limitations of this study are the lack of repeated
measures and the unnatural setting of clinical vignettes,
which are unable to perfectly mirror the wide variations in
GvHD presentation in real life and their relative incidence.
This particular experimental design was chosen to simplify
logistics, optimize healthcare professional participation,
avoid patient stress, and keep respondent burden to a min￾imum. It also allowed for multiple experts to validate the
GvHD assessment. Such an expert consensus is rarely
obtained in clinical practice, but was considered to be the
best gold standard available to date to serve as reference for
the accurate scoring during GvHD assessment. 
So, it remains to be determined whether the App will also
improve accuracy when being used in real life circum￾stances. Yet, even in this artificial setting, the low sponta￾neous GvHD scoring accuracy obtained in this evaluation
with traditional methods (obtaining a median of 4.5 cor￾rectly scored vignettes out of a maximum of 10) is in line
with the results of a previous validation study carried out in
a more real-world setting. This study included actual
patient examinations and showed that only 50-75% of
freshly trained clinicians actually agreed with experts on the
overall severity score of the evaluated chronic GvHD
patients.6 Mitchell et al. concluded that a single training ses￾sion was not sufficient to achieve consistently acceptable
inter-rater agreement between novice healthcare practition￾ers and GvHD experts. Clinical training in GvHD physical
examinations may thus be necessary to achieve repro￾ducible severity assessment with high inter-rater reliability
in practice. By ensuring the systematic assessment of all
organs potentially affected by GvHD, the App can also
serve as a training tool, aimed at making healthcare profes￾sionals ultimately independent of technological assistance.
The eGVHD App is currently limited to a calculator func￾H.M. Schoemans et al.

tion that evaluates the patient at a single point in time.
Expanding on our promising accuracy results and user-feed￾back, future plans include the development of a module to
perform longitudinal patient evaluations (with an integrat￾ed disease response evaluation according to international
criteria18,19) and a module to capture patient-reported GvHD
evaluation based on the Lee symptom scale.20 These added
functionalities will dramatically increase the clinical useful￾ness of the tool in following patients over time.
However, a challenging issue with eHealth tools is how
to approach their constant and rapid change over time. This
evolution is driven by evolving clinical practices, user feed￾back, and updates in computer programs and/or operating
systems. The results reported in this study, for instance,
have been obtained with a version of the eGVHD app
which has already become obsolete, as a new version
(using additional skip-logic features) has been developed to
address the valid criticism expressed about the time-con￾suming aspect of its use. The constant evolution of the vir￾tual world is a challenge in the current context of European
regulation (EU Directive 93/42/EEC MEDDEV 2. 4/1 Rev. 9
June 2010), which requires eHealth applications to be for￾mally validated by a tedious quality assurance process at
every new adaptation of the tool. This is not practically fea￾sible in real life, and is probably, more often than not,
unnecessary. Health regulation agencies will need to adjust

their requirements in the near future to allow for this
dynamic progress of the cyber world, even for healthcare
applications. This is, in fact, probably one of the most chal￾lenging aspects of integrating eTools in modern models of
care.21 
Compared to other smaller-scaled initiatives, which have
shown successful implementation of eHealth technologies
in local electronic medical record systems14 or specific
research programs12,13 to assess GvHD, the eGVHD App is
now widely available (www.uzleuven.be/egvhd) for all health￾care professionals who wish to obtain bedside user-friendly
assistance in their GvHD assessment, and to improve their
expertise and/or the uniformity of their GvHD data collec￾tion, both in daily practice and in clinical trials. Further val￾idation regarding its usefulness and scalability will, there￾fore, be able to rely on the analysis of the real-life data gen￾erated by downloads and feedback from users, based on
implementation research principles. If results are convinc￾ing, the next steps could include the direct integration of
eGVHD App-generated data in larger registry databases
and electronic medical record systems to circumvent the
need to produce separate reports and repeat data entry.
Such developments will require further reflections on how
to achieve optimal control of the quality of the entered data
and guarantee its privacy protection according to local laws. 
In conclusion, the eGVHD App shows superior accuracy
for the GvHD assessment of clinical vignettes compared to
usual care and has, therefore, the potential to improve the
quality of GvHD data in clinical research and practice. In
the era of electronic medical files, ‘big data’ and increased
connectivity, e-Tools are likely to become widespread in
our daily practice and could even gradually turn the individ￾ual patient into his or her own data manager and most
involved advocate. Only time and continuous research will
tell whether such tools can be effectively used in clinical
practice and whether healthcare professionals are ready to
accept IT assistance to solve some of the practical issues.
