Cystic disease of the liver and biliary tract
A Forbes, I M Murray-Lyon
Abstract
The widespread availability of ultrasound
imaging has led to more frequent recognition
of cystic disease affecting the liver and biliary
tract. There is a wide range of possible causes.
Cystic disease of infective origin is usually
caused by an Echinococcal species, or as the
sequel of a treated amoebic or pyogenic
abscess. The clinical and radiological features
are often then distinctive and will not be dwelt
upon in this review, except in respect of their
contribution to the differential diagnosis of
non-infective disorders. The principal non￾infective cysts can be conveniently divided
between the simple cyst, the polycystic syn￾dromes (usually with coexistent renal disease),
Caroli's syndrome, and choledochal cysts.
The overlap between constituent members of
these groups, and the association of cystic
disease with hepatic fibrosis (especially with
congenital hepatic fibrosis) has attracted con￾siderable attention, and it has been suggested
that they may all be considered to belong
to a hepatobiliary fibrocystic continuum. In
addition there are a variety of cystic neoplasms
and a miscellany of unusual forms.

Investigation and diagnosis
Large cystic lesions may be recognised clinically,
but in most cases will be found at ultrasound
examination undertaken because of symptoms,
or laboratory screening tests suggestive ofhepato￾biliary disease; cysts are not infrequently an
incidental finding when scans are done for un￾related clinical problems.
An accurate differential diagnosis will often be
possible from ultrasonography alone.'2 Most
commonly, one or more clearly defined echo￾lucent spaces are identified within the liver
substance. When these have thin walls and
reduce the signal from more distant structures,
the most likely diagnosis is of simple cyst and
further investigation is usually unnecessary. It is
suggested, however, that magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging may be particularly helpful in
doubtful cases.34 Thicker walled single or mul￾tiple cysts with a multilayer or laminated margin
are likely to be hydatid, and the presence of
daughter cysts within the lesion is virtually
pathognomonic. A supportive history and posi￾tive serology will usually allow confirmation of
this diagnosis. Aspiration ofpresumptive hydatid
cysts is contra-indicated because of the perceived
high risk of anaphylaxis if cyst contents spill into
the peritoneum, and there is usually no need to
consider aspiration if hydatid disease is suspec￾ted. The hazard has perhaps been over empha￾sised, however, and if hydatid disease is unlikely
and cysts have inconclusive sonographic appear￾ances, aspiration for microbiological and cyto￾logical examination is warranted. Several reports
- (for example,5 and our own unpublished obser￾vations) of needle diagnosis of unsuspected hy￾datid disease, and even therapy by ultrasound
guided transcutaneous injection of sclerosant,6 7
indicate that if the transhepatic route is taken the
risk of morbidity is low.
Distinction of abscess from cyst is relatively
simple if an abscess has viscous echo dense
contents with a thick wall and densely com￾pressed surrounding hepatic parenchyma. Per￾cutaneous aspiration allows confirmation of the
diagnosis, provides material for microbiological
examination, and may be of major therapeutic
benefit. Positive blood cultures or amoebic
serology may, however, render aspiration super￾fluous, given that small single abscesses can be
effectively managed with systemic antimicro￾bials alone. Open surgical drainage remains
necessary for optimal results in some patients
with chronic multiloculated abscesses.
Cystic lesions in continuity with the biliary
tree or with vascular structures may be identified
by ultrasound (the latter particularly so with
Doppler probes), but it will usually be necessary
to obtain contrast studies (by ERCP or angio￾graphy) for complete diagnosis. In this context
computed tomography and MR images of the
hepatobiliary region do not appear at present to
offer many advantages over high resolution sono￾graphic examination. The interested reader is
referred to one of a number of illustrated reviews
in the radiological literature. i2I4 8
Liver biopsy tends to be avoided in the
investigation of cystic disorders, a stance cer￾tainly justified when there is suspicion of hydatid
disease, and probably so when imaging suggests
choledochal cyst, but the recognition of under￾lying fibrosis is then less likely, and the clinician
is denied potentially important prognostic
information.
SIMPLE HEPATIC CYSTS
Benign non-parasitic cysts of the liver, once
considered rare because they are generally small
and asymptomatic, are more commonly shown
by modem imaging (prevalence between 0 19
and 2.5%),2 more so in women (female:male ratio
1 .5),2 more often in the right lobe, and probably
ofcongenital origin. The cysts are lined by biliary
columnar epithelium, but it is relatively unusual
for the fluid contents to be bile. If the typical
appearances at sonography described above are
seen, no further investigation or treatment is
required. The sensitivity of aspiration cytology
in potentially neoplastic cysts with no definite
solid component is low, but may be improved by
assay ofcyst contents for tumour markers such as

Cystic disease ofthe liver and biliary tract
carcinoembryonic antigen.'0 Other than from
serial scans begun at the time of infection it is not
clear that postinfective cysts - longterm sequelae
of unaspirated abscesses - can accurately be
distinguished from congenital benign cysts.' 8
All benign cysts appear subject to a variety of
complications. Bleeding into or infection of the
cyst contents may be responsible for the onset of
pain or other symptoms; enlargement of cysts
also occurs without obvious cause, and may then
lead to the presence of a painful swelling,"
obstructive jaundice'2 or intraperitoneal perfora￾tion.'3 Although surgical intervention may
become necessary, in the absence of peritonitis
or severe intraabdominal bleeding, conservative
management is probably to be preferred,'4 15
with'2 or without'6 percutaneous aspiration.
Recurrent symptoms may be prevented by in￾ternal drainage ofthe cyst'7 or by the instillation of
sclerosant,'891 the latter course in our view to be
followed only after very careful direct cholangio￾graphy has excluded communication with the
biliary tree, if biliary sclerosis is to be avoided.
Although there does not seem to be a major
problem with alcohol injection in analogous
management of hydatid cysts7 longterm follow
up data are sparse. Surgical deroofing of cysts
without drainage ofthe residual cavity is strongly
recommended20 if surgery is thought indicated.
Concern that simple cysts represent a premalig￾nant state has been generated by a series of
reports of neoplasia in apparently preexisting
benign cysts. The tumours are, however, of
disparate histological type - for example, muco￾epidermoid carcinoma,2' multifocal papillary
cystadenocarcinoma,22 squamous cell car￾cinoma23 - and these may represent coincidental
associations rather than complications. The
observation that foci of cystadenoma and cysta￾denocarcinoma (the most common malignancy
described with simple cysts) coexisted with
hamartomatous bile ducts24 tends, however, to
support the view22 that there is a causative link.
Although these tumours appear to have a gener￾ally poor prognosis, their rarity does not seem to
us to warrant indefinite surveillance of asympto￾matic patients believed to have simple cysts
alone. The claimed stronger association between
non-parasitic liver cysts and benign liver
tumours" is, at first sight, more convincing, but
probably reflects rather the association between
von Meyenburg complexes, hepatic fibrosis and
polycystic disease (see below).
POLYCYSTIC DISEASES
Adult polycystic disease, of autosomal dominant
inheritance with high penetrance, may present at
any age with renal manifestations, but although
hepatic involvement is common, clinically signifi￾cant liver disease is rare (<15%), and does not
usually affect the natural history.26 Hepatic cysts
are not often seen before puberty but become
more frequent with increasing age (<20% in
those under 30,27 28 >75% in those over 7026 27);
they are more common in women,28 especially
those with children. When liver disease occurs it
usually accompanies relatively advanced renal
disease (mean creatinine clearance two thirds of
those without hepatic cysts.28) Polycystic liver
disease may, however, occur in the absence of
significant renal involvement. The cysts are lined
by biliary type epithelium which retains a func￾tional response to secretin.9 Their pathogenesis
(akin to that of simple cysts) is considered to
reflect failed involution of excess intralobular
bile ducts during embryological develop￾ment.3031 Liver biopsy shows portal tract fibrosis
and numerous cystically dilated channels; the
hepatic parenchyma is otherwise normal but it is
not unusual to find Von Meyenburg complexes
in non-cystic parts of the liver (see below). Overt
congenital hepatic fibrosis (see below) certainly
occurs32 but is unusual.
Apparently spontaneous infection of hepatic
cysts is described, usually with gut derived
organisms, and prompt recognition and drainage
greatly reduces the mortality which may exceed
75% with antibiotic therapy alone.33 Mechanical
cholestasis caused by the cysts is rare,3' but a
common topic of case reports: it remains unclear
why the pressure within the cysts should rise
sufficiently to cause obstruction, but hormonal
responsiveness29 may be of relevance. Relief of
biliary obstruction may be satisfactorily pro￾vided by percutaneous aspiration.3' In advanced
disease portal hypertension responsible for
ascites and variceal haemorrhage can become
problematic34: good results may be obtained
from portosystemic anastomosis. In the majority
of cases, however, management will be that of
chronic renal failure with consideration of renal
transplantation. If there are problems related to
the sheer size of the liver or coexistent sympto￾matic portal hypertension, then many units will
now take the opportunity to carry out double
organ grafts from the same donor: good results
are reported, but disappointingly King's was not
the first unit to publish specifically on this
topic.35
The autosomal recessive form of polycystic
disease usually presents in infancy with renal
failure and massive kidneys: these patients rarely
have significant liver disease. Presentations later
in life are associated with less aggressive renal
disease, but with a progressively higher fre￾quency of congenital hepatic fibrosis and likeli￾hood of portal hypertension.32 Patients with the
mildest renal involvement are perhaps most
likely to have an hepatic presentation. The
clinical diagnosis based on renal enlargement
and hepatomegaly is supported by biochemical
evidence of renal failure, relatively normal
liver function, and the demonstration of renal
cysts on utrasound scanning: the hepatic cysts
are often too small to be identified sonographi￾cally. Histologically, the hepatic cysts appear
identical to those of autosomal dominant cases.
Liver Unit authors were responsible for the
recognition of a number of other renal cystic
disorders associated with hepatic fibrosis,36 the
latter apparently indistinguishable from con￾genital hepatic fibrosis.
CONGENITAL HEPATIC FIBROSIS
Congenital hepatic fibrosis deserves its present
inclusion because of the frequency with which it
is associated with cystic disease. In its overt form
it usually presents in childhood with complica￾S117

tions of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
(especially bleeding), but may present in adult￾hood;37 asymptomatic forms are encountered at
all ages. It is most often associated with the
recessive form of polycystic kidney disease, but
at least two groups32 38 give convincing accounts
of an association between congenital hepatic
fibrosis and autosomal dominant polycystic
disease. Equally, in a few cases the kidneys are
apparently normal.36 Histologically there is a
considerable increase in fibrous stroma dis￾tributed in broad bands throughout the liver
with focal epithelial components and islands of
normal lobular architure. Such 'pure' congenital
hepatic fibrosis may be disguised by coexistent
histological features of polycystic disease, and
often by the presence of Von Meyenburg com￾plexes. These biliary microhamartomata lie
within dense fibrous stroma and surround
epithelially lined irregular spaces which may
contain bile. The complexes expand within or
adjacent to the portal tracts and, as they are
usually multiple, may be confused with micro￾metastases. They may be responsible for portal
hypertension without more generalised fibrosis.
The Liver Unit described the association of
congenital hepatic fibrosis with intra and even
extra hepatic biliary dilatation' producing a
picture identical to Caroli's syndrome except
that in that situation there is no fibrosis of the
congenital hepatic fibrosis pattern.
A recent autopsy study25 which supported the
association of fibrosis with cystic disease added
the new observation that benign hepatic
adenomas are associated with non-parasitic cysts;
that the description is of polycystic disease rather
than of simple cysts seems likely, but the signifi￾cance of the association is probably of greater
importance than the semantics of diagnosis.
CAROLI'S SYNDROME
Congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile
ducts without obstruction was recognised by
Caroli in 1958.39 Pure Caroli's syndrome remains
an unusual diagnosis, with fewer than 150 cases
in the world literature. A hereditary component
- possibly recessive autosomal transmission - is
supported by a report of the condition in two
sisters. I The saccular cystic dilatations more
commonly affect the left lobe, and may be
associated with biliary stasis, cholangitis, stone
formation (in about 25%), and pain. Involve￾ment of the extra hepatic bile ducts is unusual.
Although symptoms may begin in childhood and
progress remorselessly via fibrocholangio￾matosis to cirrhosis, a significant proportion of
affected individuals will remain asymptomatic.
The diagnosis should be seriously considered in
any child with cholangitis. The combination of
ultrasonography and ERCP lead to the diagnosis,
although there is a small risk that the latter may
reprecipitate cholangitis. Management depends
on correct diagnosis and on the extent of liver
involvement. Symptomatic disease affecting
only one lobe of the liver can usually be success￾fully resected,4' albeit with considerable diffi￾culty if extensive intrahepatic cholelithiasis has
to be dealt with concurrently.42 More extensive
resection, with hepatojejunal anastomosis, is also
possible for multilobular disease,43 and the
option of orthotopic transplantation remains for
the end-stage patient with bilobar disease and/or
cirrhosis, so long as sepsis can be controlled
preoperatively.
Caroli's syndrome may be complicated by
pancreatitis,45 obstructive portal lymphadeno￾pathy4 or extra biliary sepsis,47 and advanced
disease is usually associated with fibrocholangio￾matosis; itself often responsible for portal hyper￾tension.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis has a number of
common features with Caroli's syndrome,
especially when dilated duct segments take on a
cystic appearance." Although a firm diagnosis is
usually possible there are occasions when the two
conditions cannot be clearly distinguished, and it
is possible that an overlap syndrome exists.
Caroli's syndrome is certainly associated with
hepatic fibrosis, and a report of Caroli's syn￾drome in renal polycystic disease49 suggests again
that the distinctions between the different cystic
diagnoses are not fundamental but more a matter
of degree. Also consistent with this notion, is the
important observation that Caroli's syndrome is
probably a premalignant condition; frank malig￾nancy47 may be preceded by biliary epithelial
dysplasia.50
CHOLEDOCHAL CYSTS
Choledochal cysts account for approximately 1%
of all benign biliary disease5' and as recently as
1980 less than 40% were diagnosed preopera￾tively.52 They are primarily of concern to paedia￾tricians and paediatric surgeons as more than
60% present before 1Oyears ofage. Thefrequency
is highest in Japan but appears relatively uniform
across the rest of the globe. Numerous large
historical series have been reported, but this
relatively common rarity has continued to exert
an appeal to authors and editors alike, because
several hundred papers can be identified from
Index medicus over the past five years alone -
many of these being single case reports. A
consensus on management is nevertheless
emerging despite the absence of controlled trials.
Almost all authorities now use modifications of
the Alonso-Lej classification,53 typically dividing
choledochal cysts into four groups (Fig 1). The
commonest (type I) comprises a fusiform or
saccular dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tree
with a normal or stenotic distal common bile
duct. Less often cysts appear as common bile

duct diverticula (type II), are contained within
the intraduodenal course of the duct (type III),
or are more generalised, involving both intra and
extrahepatic duct systems (type IV) (Fig 1).
There is evidently a point at which it becomes
difficult to distinguish between intrahepatic
choledochal cyst and Caroli's syndrome; reports
claiming heterogeneity of Caroli's syndrome54
apparently fail to appreciate the semantic nature
of diagnosis in this situation. It is probably
reasonable to consider choledochal cyst a part of
the continuum already discussed in respect of the
purely intrahepatic cystic conditions.
It is almost certain that choledochal cysts are
of congenital origin, but the pathogenesis is less
clear. It has been speculated that there is a
differential abnormality in biliary epithelial pro￾liferation in the embryo such that the solid core
of proto-bile duct takes on a cystic form55; there
is, however, no good evidence to support this. It
is probable that reflux of pancreatic juice into the
biliary tree is of relevance, however.56 A very
large proportion of (and possibly all) patients
with choledochal cyst have an unusually long
common channel between the junction of the
common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct
and their joint outflow into the duodenum
(Fig 2).57 The increased intraductal pressure
associated with this anomaly predisposes to
reflux and may also be associated with ectasia of
the common channel57 (or indeed with pan￾creatitis.)58 High concentrations of pancreatic
enzymes within cyst fluid are common and
pancreatitis may be diagnosed erroneously when
hyperamylasaemia also occurs.59 A recent report
ofcholedochal cyst in mother and daughter, both
of whom had a long common channel and the
same type of cystO suggests that a hereditary
element is important in some cases. Concurrent
hepatic fibrosis has not attracted much attention,
but certainly occurs,37 and lends support to the
inclusion of choledochal cystic disease in the
fibrocystic continuum.
Choledochal cysts may remain asymptomatic
for many years (and possibly for life) but the
majority will at some time cause one or more of
the classical triad of pain, obstruction and pal￾pable mass, often in association with cholangitis,
or exhibit one of the less common features
enumerated by the Department of Surgery at
King's,61 such as ascites, variceal haemorrhage,
or biliary peritonitis from spontaneous rupture.
Many patients will initially respond to simple
medical measures, allowing time for careful
assessment. Continued conservative therapy,
provision of internal (or very occasionally
external) drainage, or excision of the cyst must
then be considered. The anatomy will usually be
readily apparent from ultrasound scanning and
ERCP, but will in a few cases remain enigmatic
despite the full range of currently available
radiological techniques. Treatment options
should be considered in the light of the collected
historical series. It appears that about 50% of
patients having drainage procedures will need
reoperation - usually because of recurrent sepsis
or cholestasis,62 and one author63 makes the
startling claim that his study 'provides conclusive
evidence that any anastomosis of cyst wall to the
gastrointestinal tract will ultimately result in
stricture and cholangitis'. Moreover, at least one
group'M have found (admittedly without taking
full account of the technical considerations that
determined the original operation), that the
perioperative mortality is substantially higher
for drainage procedures than for excision (8-6%
v 0%). Excisions may vary between a chole￾cystectomy like removal of a type II cyst to a
virtual extirpation of the biliary tree; most
authors now prefer hepatojejunostomy.
Excisions are not without their complications,
however. One of the most experienced groups62
recently described a reoperation rate of nearly
10% in 73 excisions - although all seven ulti￾mately did well. Major revisions were needed in
most cases - usually conversion from hepatoduo￾denostomy to hepato-Roux-Y-jejunostomy after
early haemorrhage/leak or late stenosis of the
original anastomosis.
Carcinoma (adenocarcinoma in more than
90%) is now well recognised as a complication of
choledochal cysts. The life time risk for the
individual may be as high as 50% if non￾resectional surgery has been carried out.65 Bile
stagnation, continual pancreatic reflux, and
related chronic ulceration and regeneration of
the cyst epithelium are thought causally
relevant.'M Investigation of an 18 year old patient
with a choledochal cyst showed an increase in
secondary bile salts (most of which were uncon￾jugated) within the cyst fluid, despite an entirely
normal bile salt pattern in intrahepatic bile. The
authors attribute this to bacterial colonisation
within the cyst, and speculate that this caused
the patient's biliary epithelial metaplasia and
could contribute to the development of neo￾plasia.67 It is probable that the cancer risk is
substantially higher in patients presenting for
the first time as adults, and attributed risks of
between 5 and 40% have been suggested.66
Review of the computed tomography files in one
Japanese institution68 revealed that eight of 35
consecutive adult cases of choledochal cyst had
complicating malignancy. It must be noted that
the studies with the longest follow up periods
have consistently given the highest figures.
Although the most common site of origin for
malignant change is the posterior cyst wall, it is
evident that there is a biliary 'field' defect as
primary carcinoma may occur in biliary tissue
uninvolved in the cyst, a striking 46% occurring
in apparently normal gall bladder in one series.'

Forbes, Murray-Lyon
Prognosis once carcinoma has occurred is uni￾formly poor.
It is reasonable to conclude that choledochal
cysts should always be excised with as complete
resection of the (extrahepatic) biliary tree as
possible. Such
a policy should minimise post￾operative cholangitis/cholestasis and achieve a
low frequency ofreoperation; it should also, with
luck, eliminate the risk of malignant transforma￾tion within retained cystic components, or
apparently normal more proximal biliary
epithelium. When comprehensive excision
implies
a major pancreatic resection as well as
dissection up into the liver, however, dogmatic
views may have to be tempered, and especially so
if the patient is asymptomatic!
CYSTIC NEOPLASIA
Hepatic cysts are not often neoplastic, but cystic
tumours are recognised occasionally. Multi￾locular cystadenoma occurs almost exclusively in
middle aged women who typically present with
a
rapidly growing upper abdominal mass; about
one third develop clinical cholestasis.69 The
distinction from simple cysts is straightforward
histologically but less obvious clinically or radio￾logically: the presence of multiple cystic areas
(usually several small lesions around
a larger
cyst), the presence ofbiliary obstruction, and the
rate of progression are useful pointers. Surgical
resection is advised as malignant transformation
may occur.
Myxomatous tumours of the liver are evidently
very rare, but may be responsible for
a painful
mass70: the single reported case was probably
benign. Benign cystic hepatoblastoma occurs in
preschool children,7' usually presenting as an
abdominal mass with multiocular cysts on in￾vestigation; transformation to cystadenocar￾cinoma may occur if unresected. Malignant
cystic hepatoblastoma is
a distinct and very rare
paediatric tumour where the malignant com￾ponent of the tumour is stromal rather than
epithelial,71 the prognosis is poor.
Cystic metastases from carcinoma of the ovary
and kidney, and from intra-abdominal sarcomas
are also described. The malignant nature of these
lesions is usually apparent from associated
parenchymal disease, or from the classical sono￾graphic appearance of a malignant cyst, with
thick irregular walls studded by nodules.'
2 The
diagnosis will usually be clarified by aspiration
cytology, but serial scanning is almost as helpful
as cystic metastases typically enlarge rapidly.
OTHER CYSTIC DISORDERS
Various other cystic disorders have been des￾cribed, of which 'ectopic' pancreatic pseudocyst
is perhaps the most common, but accurate
diagnosis is otherwise unusual without histo￾logical examination of material obtained at
surgery or autopsy. Any list is unlikely to be
comprehensive.
Occlusion of small portal vein branches from
any cause (particularly compression by adjacent
hepatic tumour) can produce areas of apparent
infarction manifest as small cystic areas; as tissue
necrosis is absent these are now generally known
as pseudoinfarcts of Zahn72 and have no prog￾nostic significance in their own right.
Peliosis hepatis was originally described in the
terminal cachexia of disseminated tuberculosis,
but is now most often seen in women on
combined contraceptive pill. Work from this
unit clarified
a link between peliosis and long
term androgen therapy,73 and associations with
other conditions such as HIV infection are also
recognised.74 It is probably underdiagnosed as
investigation is embarked upon only in those
who develop hepatomegaly or abnormalities of
liver function. Histologically there are blood
filled cavernous cysts in continuity with the
sinusoids. Cysts vary in size but may reach
5 mm
in diameter and allow sonographic recognition.
Peliosis is usually harmless, and it will often
regress if
a predisposing factor can be withdrawn.
Rarely, liver failure or hepatic rupture may
occur. Sinusoidal ectasia appears to be
a milder
form of peliosis and may represent its earliest
manifestations.
Less than 20 cases of ciliated hepatic foregut
cyst have been described.75 They are thought
analogous to bronchogenic cysts, with which
they share
a ciliated mucus secreting pseudo￾stratified columnocuboidal lining with a
muscular wall and surrounding fibrous tissue.
Characteristically they have
a subcapsular site
and are usually less than
3 cm in diameter.
The sonographic findings include heterogeneous
echogenic semi fluid contents (which may at first
sight appear solid) within
a well demarcated
lesion, and aspiration reveals viscous mucinous
exudative fluid. They are non-neoplastic and
require no treatment if the diagnosis is certain.
Endometriosis may also be responsible for
hepatic cysts, successfully treated in the first
report76 by resection. Had the diagnosis been
realised preoperatively might hormonal therapy
have sufficed?
Post traumatic hepatic cysts are recognised2 in
addition to the cystic spaces that may remain
after successful non-drainage treatment for liver
abscess.
Asimilar phenomenon has been reported
from the Liver Unit after apparently curative
hepatic artery embolisation (for metastatic
apudoma),77 and is probably not uncommon
after this intervention.
Cystic fibrosis is not, it appears, associated
with higher frequencies of hepatobiliary cysts
than would be expected by chance.
Conclusion
There is much in the collected literature on
hepatic and biliary cystic disorders to suggest
common threads in aetiology, pathogenesis,
clinical presentation, complications and manage￾ment (assuming that cysts of infective or neo￾plastic origin are excluded). The strong associa￾tion of adult polycystic kidney disease with
polycystic liver disease is not complete, and it
need not be assumed that the hepatic cysts are
encoded for by the same gene defect. The various
overlap syndromes earlier alluded to allow the
possibility that even if polycystic liver disease is
also of autosomal dominant inheritance, it has
variable expression with relatively low pene￾trance. Almost all hepatobiliary cysts are lined

Cystic disease ofthe liver and biliary tract S121
by biliary epithelium or epithelium with strong
biliary characteristics. All most probably
develop in the prenatal period (and clinical
presentation is generally commoner in child￾hood). All are more common in women and there
are suggestions that hormonal factors may be
relevant. All share an assocation with hepatic
fibrosis, although the strength of the association
admittedly varies according to the major charac￾teristics of the cystic disorder. Most, and prob￾ably all, of the cysts engender a substantially
increased risk of biliary tract malignancy (and
perhaps hepatic neoplasia also), the added risk
appearing to be greatest where the cyst is in
communication with the bilary tree. It is unusual
for cysts themselves to be responsible for symp￾toms, but the complications, including those of
portal hypertension, that lead to presentation are
common to all varieties. Management can
usually afford to be expectant except for chole￾dochal cysts where, because of the cancer risk,
elective resection is indicated. There seems every
reason to support and extend the belief8 that
there is a family of interlocked and overlapping
hepatobiliary fibrocystic disorders - a view held
in part for many years on the Liver Unit.79
