Introduction 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a major public health threat 
and it is dynamic in its natural history of disease progression. The burden of end-stage liver 
disease due to this condition is projected to increase by 200-300% over the next two decades.1
 
This has led to intense drug development efforts to establish effective therapy for this condition.2
Two major approaches are being taken to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): 1) targeting 
the metabolic underpinning of the disease and other upstream drivers of disease activity2
 and 2) 
targeting downstream elements of disease course such as fibrosis to reduce disease progression.2
 
The greatest and most urgent unmet need is to develop effective therapy for those patients who 
already have developed cirrhosis and are thus at the highest risk of liver-related adverse 
outcomes. 
A major challenge, however, in conducting clinical trials for NASH cirrhosis is an 
accurate case definition for eligibility into such trials. It may be straightforward in clinical 
practice to attribute NASH as the likely cause of cirrhosis in patients without competing 
etiologies. However, the stringent case definitions required to standardize trial enrollment across 
clinical trials of investigational drugs or lifestyle interventions are currently lacking for NASH￾related cirrhosis. NASH is a histological diagnosis and yet many patients with NASH-related 
cirrhosis do not have histological confirmation at the time of their clinical presentation. If a liver 
biopsy is performed in patients with NASH cirrhosis, liver histology may not display typical 
histological lesions such as steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning in ~40% of patients.3
 
 The Liver Forum has identified the development of consensus definitions for NASH 
cirrhosis as an important step towards developing effective therapies for this condition. The 

5 
Liver Forum is a multi-stakeholder group including academic investigators from around the 
world, members of professional organizations (American Association for the Study of Liver 
Diseases and European Association for Study of the Liver), representatives from regulatory 
agencies (U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency), drug 
developers from the pharmaceutical industry, and patient advocates. This manuscript summarizes 
the work of the NASH Cirrhosis Working Group to specifically focus on case definitions that 
would allow attribution of NASH as the etiology for compensated cirrhosis. This document 
summarizes the current consensus of the working group, which will revisit this topic and update 
recommendations as new data become available. The general diagnosis of cirrhosis was 
addressed in a previous document of the Liver Forum4
 and thus will not be addressed here. 
Methodology: A formal and consistent methodology was followed to reach consensus 
recommendations. First, the literature, existing guidelines, and previous and ongoing clinical 
trials were all reviewed by the Working Group (Appendix). A standardized discussion format 
was established, and data summarized in an objective and measurable fashion. Multiple 
conference calls and correspondence were held to establish consensus when there was 
divergence of opinion. The steps involved in developing these consensus-based 
recommendations are described in Supplemental Table 1. These steps were in line with what 
has been utilized by other internationally regarded organizations5
, and by the Liver Forum to 
develop recommendations for baseline parameters6
, case definitions4
, endpoints7
, and pediatric 
trials8
. 
Definition of NASH as the cause of cirrhosis 

6 
Liver biopsy is currently the reference standard to determine NASH as the cause for 
cirrhosis based on specific histological features including steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte 
ballooning, in addition to the presence of cirrhosis. In the context of NASH clinical trials, a 
NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of 4 points or higher has been used to identify patients with 
clinically significant disease activity.9
 However, some of the histological features indicating 
disease activity may not always be readily apparent or easily identified in NASH patients with 
cirrhosis, and thus, the NAS can be lower than 4. This may lead to a higher percentage of screen 
failures in NASH cirrhosis trials due to the inability to detect active steatohepatitis in such 
patients.10 In clinical practice, when a patient presents with clinically evident cirrhosis, there is 
less enthusiasm to recommend a liver biopsy, when the clinical picture is consistent with fatty 
liver disease, either due to concern for heightened risk of complications or due to patient’s 
reluctance. If a patient currently presenting with cirrhosis (but without a recent liver biopsy) has 
previously documented NAFLD, it is reasonable to consider NASH as the likely etiology, as 
long as other possible etiologies are comprehensively excluded. Some histological features (e.g., 
steatosis) disappear as cirrhosis develops and progresses, making identification of the underlying 
etiology of cirrhosis difficult (cryptogenic cirrhosis is considered in more detail below).10
 
The working group’s consensus was that the case definition of NASH-related cirrhosis 
for inclusion in clinical trials may be qualitatively categorized according to a hierarchy based on 
the degree of certainty of NASH as the cause of cirrhosis, e.g. definitive, probable, and possible 
categories (see definitions below and Table 1). Within each category, the definitions are listed 
by decreasing order of confidence (e.g., 2a is considered more robust than 2b). When some of the 
histological evidence is absent, the presence of concomitant metabolic risk factors (history of 

7 
type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], hypertension, dyslipidemia or obesity) strengthens the 
likelihood that NASH is the cause of cirrhosis. A diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis can be made only 
in the absence of other etiologies such as excessive alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, 
hemochromatosis, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson’s disease, 
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune hepatitis. 4,9,11
 
1. Definite NASH cirrhosis 
The attribution of NASH as a definite cause of cirrhosis includes: 
1a. Patients with current liver biopsy showing cirrhosis with steatohepatitis. 
1b. Patients with a previous biopsy showing steatohepatitis, but now with evidence of 
cirrhosis, either by clinical history or current features, imaging, noninvasive tests, 
or biopsy. 
Among individuals with a current biopsy, histological findings consistent with 
active steatohepatitis may have disappeared. In such instances, there should be at 
least one metabolic risk factor to support the likelihood of NASH as the 
underlying cause of cirrhosis. 
1c. Patients with a current biopsy showing cirrhosis with steatosis (but no findings of 
active steatohepatitis) together with at least two co-existing or historical features 
of metabolic comorbidities including obesity and/or T2DM to corroborate a 
diagnosis of NASH as the cause of cirrhosis (Table 1). 
The 1a definition has the highest degree of certainty, while criteria for metabolic 
comorbidities were added to both 1b and 1c to increase the likelihood of diagnosing NASH 

8 
cirrhosis in the absence of a recent biopsy demonstrating cirrhosis and steatohepatitis. In the case 
where there is less histological evidence for NASH (e.g., 1c vs. 1b), requiring more than one 
comorbidity may increase the certainty of NASH diagnosis, a plausible conclusion which is 
supported by recent data from NASH cirrhosis studies (see Table 1 for a list of comorbidities).3, 
12 Further, when individuals meeting such criteria undergo liver transplantation, there is ~88% 
recurrence of NAFLD over time, compared to ~20% incidence of NAFLD among those with 
cirrhosis due to other etiologies.13
NASH is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, the definition of which has been 
harmonized across several academic societies.14 However, both hypertension and dyslipidemia 
may be less evident once patients develop cirrhosis due to the dynamic nature and 
pathophysiological changes associated with cirrhosis.15 For example, splanchnic vasodilatation 
associated with cirrhosis reduces systemic blood pressure15, and history of T2DM and obesity 
has not only been associated with NAFLD but also with severity of the disease.16, 17 It is 
currently unknown whether the duration of these comorbidities affects the disease progression to 
cirrhosis. Nevertheless, it is likely that the longer the duration of having these comorbidities, 
especially obesity and T2DM, the greater the likelihood of cirrhosis development. Although a 
complete agreement on this topic was not achieved, we suggest that a minimum of 5 years 
duration is reasonable to support that co-existing metabolic disease(s) contribute to NASH 
progression; however, this majority view will require validation and may require modification as 
relevant data emerge. 
2. Probable NASH cirrhosis 

9 
2a. Patients with a previous biopsy with steatosis but not steatohepatitis, and current 
cirrhosis, either by a clinical history or current features, imaging, noninvasive 
tests, or biopsy. If there is a current biopsy, it may not show evidence of steatosis 
or steatohepatitis as these histological features may have disappeared. There must 
be at least two co-existing or history of metabolic comorbidities including obesity 
and/or T2DM to support NASH as an underlying cause of cirrhosis. 
2b. Patients with cirrhosis (either by a clinical history or current features, imaging, or 
noninvasive tests) with current or previous imaging showing evidence of 
steatosis. There is no liver histology available. There are at least two co-existing 
or historical metabolic comorbidities including obesity and/or T2DM to support 
NASH as an underlying cause of cirrhosis. 
2c. Patients with “cryptogenic cirrhosis” (either by a clinical history or current 
features, imaging, noninvasive tests, or biopsy) without current or previous 
evidence of steatosis by imaging or steatosis/steatohepatitis by histology. There 
are at least two co-existing or historical metabolic comorbidities including obesity 
and/or T2DM to support NASH as an underlying cause of cirrhosis.
Cryptogenic cirrhosis and its relationship to NASH is an area of ongoing research. In a recent 
clinical trial, Younossi, et al, found that 40% of cryptogenic cirrhosis patients had steatosis on 
their exit biopsy, although their baseline biopsy had no features to suggest NAFLD or NASH.3
Similar to NASH patients, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had clustering of metabolic 
comorbidities, strengthening the rationale of including metabolic comorbidities in these case 
definitions.3, 18 Indeed, it has been shown that a large number of these patients will have a 

10 
recurrence of NAFLD post-liver transplantation.19 13 In addition, Younossi et al 3
 showed that the 
cryptogenic cirrhosis group had higher fibrosis markers, more collagen content on biopsies and a 
higher risk of liver-related events than patient with definitive NASH cirrhosis. This plausibly 
suggests that these patients are further along in the course of their disease and likely in most need 
for effective therapies. 
3. Possible NASH Cirrhosis 
3a. Patients with “cryptogenic cirrhosis” (either by a clinical history or current 
features, imaging, noninvasive tests, or biopsy) without current or previous 
evidence of steatosis by imaging or steatosis/steatohepatitis by histology. There is 
one co-existing or history of metabolic comorbidity including obesity and/or 
T2DM.
3b. Patients with previously eradicated hepatitis C virus (HCV), or a remote history 
of heavy alcohol consumption, but who currently have evidence of cirrhosis and 
histological evidence of steatohepatitis. Patients with a remote history of heavy 
alcohol consumption should not have evidence of cirrhosis at the time of stopping 
alcohol. 
Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may have minimal metabolic co-morbidities (See 
Table 1), which makes the likelihood of NASH as the cause of cirrhosis less certain. For this 
reason, we define this category as ‘possible’ and recommend further discussions between 
regulatory authorities and sponsors before enrolling such patients into a NASH cirrhosis clinical 
trial. 

11 
It is worth mentioning that establishing the duration of a comorbid condition can be 
challenging in terms of medical record documentation as well as delays in diagnosis due to lack 
of access to medical care. Previous medical records or a thorough history of a patient’s 
medications may increase confidence in determining the duration of these conditions; however, 
documentation in medical records (e.g. duration of dyslipidemia; medication start/stop dates) is 
not always available. Further discussion with regulatory agencies during protocol development 
for the trial is warranted regarding whether patient self-reported history could be considered 
acceptable. 
Finally, as HCV moved from being the leading cause of cirrhosis and indication for liver 
transplantation, many patients whose HCV has been eradicated following treatment with highly 
active anti-viral therapy, have concurrent metabolic comorbidities, resulting in concurrent 
NASH.20, 21 If these patients did not have cirrhosis at the time of sustained virologic response 
(SVR) and subsequently develop cirrhosis, this can be attributed to NASH especially if enough 
time has elapsed since SVR. However, if these patients were known to have cirrhosis at the time 
of SVR, it is plausible that cirrhosis developed due to both conditions (NASH and HCV). Given 
the uncertainty as to what constitutes “enough time” since SVR, the following recommendations 
are provided, acknowledging that the level of evidence to support any decision is not substantial 
at this time. For testing anti-fibrotic drugs in patients with previous HCV infection, a 2-year time 
frame of SVR prior to enrollment22 might be adequate to exclude the effects of HCV on those 
who currently have evidence of cirrhosis and histological evidence of steatohepatitis. A longer 
duration might be warranted in the case of HCV genotype 3 if anti-steatotic drugs are being 
considered; other causes of chronic liver disease should still be excluded. The area of NASH and 

12 
other co-existing chronic liver diseases requires further research and is beyond the scope of this 
document. 
Summary 
An accurate case definition of NASH cirrhosis is critical for enrolling appropriate 
patients into clinical trials as well as to maintain comparability across different clinical trials. 
Yet, there are no published criteria for defining NASH cirrhosis. This prompted the Liver Forum 
to develop consensus case definitions for NASH cirrhosis for clinical trial eligibility. Given that 
patients with cirrhosis may no longer have evidence of active steatohepatitis on biopsy at the 
time of enrollment and may not have a historical biopsy to establish the diagnosis, these case 
definitions provide recommendations, based on varying levels of confidence, on how to approach 
a range of clinical scenarios and determine the likelihood that NASH is the etiology of cirrhosis. 
The appropriate subgroups of participants (definite, probable, possible) for inclusion into a 
specific clinical trial in this patient population should be discussed with regulatory agencies prior 
to finalizing the study design.
