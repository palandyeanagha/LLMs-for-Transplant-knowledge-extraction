The sinoatrial node is perhaps one of the most important tissues in the entire body:
it is the natural pacemaker of the heart, making it responsible for initiating each-and￾every normal heartbeat. As such, its activity is heavily controlled, allowing heart rate to
rapidly adapt to changes in physiological demand. Control of sinoatrial node activity,
however, is complex, occurring through the autonomic nervous system and various
circulating and locally released factors. In this review we discuss the coupled-clock
pacemaker system and how its manipulation by neurohumoral signaling alters heart
rate, considering the multitude of canonical and non-canonical agents that are known to
modulate sinoatrial node activity. For each, we discuss the principal receptors involved
and known intracellular signaling and protein targets, highlighting gaps in our knowledge
and understanding from experimental models and human studies that represent areas
for future research.

INTRODUCTION
The heart’s natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (SAN), spontaneously initiates each heartbeat.
Located adjacent to the crista terminalis at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena
cava, the SAN fires action potentials (AP) that propagate through the electrical conduction system
and the myocardium, initiating contraction. This specialized group of cells is necessary for life, as
its rhythmical firing leads to the pumping of blood to the rest of the body. Because its function is
so essential, the SAN has many redundant systems in place to ensure it continues to consistently
generate APs (Difrancesco and Noble, 2012; Maltsev and Lakatta, 2012; Rosen et al., 2012). The
frequency of AP firing from the SAN determines heart rate (HR), and there are a multitude of
factors that influence the systems that generate the SAN AP. Thus, SAN activity is tightly controlled
to maintain normal heart rhythm and allow for adaption to changes in physiological demand.
Modulation of SAN activity occurs through intracellular signaling and its alteration by
neurohumoral agents, including neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and autocrine, paracrine,
and endocrine factors (Irisawa et al., 1993; MacDonald et al., 2017), as well as response to
changes in mechanical load (Quinn and Kohl, 2012). Neurohumoral agents primarily (although
not exclusively) activate a variety of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) in the sarcolemma of

SAN myocytes (Marin-Garcia, 2011). GPCR in turn activate
second messenger cascades that target intracellular components
responsible for SAN automaticity, causing a change in HR
(Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008; Figure 1). Many of the factors that
modulate SAN activity have been extensively studied and are
understood to be principally important for the control of HR.
Other factors, especially those with secondary effects on the SAN,
are less well understood, complicated by contradictory results in
the literature. A list of neurohumoral agents, their receptors, and
their effect on HR is found in Table 1.
In this review, we first provide a brief overview of
the mechanisms that drive SAN automaticity, to introduce
the principal targets for modulation of SAN activity by
neurohumoral signaling. This is followed by consideration of
neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and autocrine, paracrine,
and endocrine factors with known effects on SAN activity
and HR, including their receptors, intracellular signaling, and
protein targets, in particular highlighting what is known from
experimental models, what has been confirmed in human studies,
and where gaps in our current understanding exist, to identify
areas for future research.
SAN AUTOMATICITY
Cardiac automaticity is driven by depolarization of SAN
membrane potential during diastole (spontaneous diastolic
depolarization, SDD; Figure 1). The principal mechanisms
responsible for SDD have been heavily debated (Rosen et al.,
2012). The two concepts that have emerged are that of a
“membrane-clock,” resulting from a flow of ions through trans￾sarcolemmal channels, and a “Ca2+-clock,” resulting from
intracellular Ca2+ cycling (Bartos et al., 2015). It is now generally
accepted that these are in fact overlapping and redundant
systems that work together to cause SAN automaticity, and
form a combined system often referred to as the “coupled-clock”
(Lakatta et al., 2010; Rosen et al., 2012).
Membrane-Clock
During early SDD, the membrane-clock is driven by an
inward cation current known as the “funny” current (If
),
passing through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide￾gated (HCN) channels (Difrancesco, 2010). There are four
isoforms of HCN (HCN1-4), with HCN1, 2, and 4 expressed
in the human heart, notably more prominently in the SAN
than the atria, and with HCN1 specifically being expressed
almost exclusively in the SAN (Li et al., 2015). Studies of HCN1
knock-out in mice support these findings, demonstrating high
expression and critical importance of HCN1 for maintenance
of HR and beat-to-beat stability (Fenske et al., 2013). Along
with If
, inward Ca2+ currents through both Cav3.1 transient (T￾type, ICa,T) and Cav1.2/1.3 long-lasting (L-type, ICaL) channels
are important for SAN firing (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008).
Cav3.1 and Cav1.3 activate at relatively low thresholds (∼ –70
and –55 mV, respectively), allowing them to contribute to the
early portion of SDD (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008). Once
the threshold for Cav1.2 activation is reached (∼ –40 mV),
ICaL generates the upstroke of the SAN AP [unlike working
cardiomyocytes, in which the fast sodium (Na+) current
(INa), passing through Nav1.5 channels, is responsible for
the AP upstroke] (Mesirca et al., 2015). Nav1.5 channels are
heterogeneously expressed in the SAN, and primarily at the
periphery, so while they are not necessary for SAN automaticity,
they can indirectly influence pacemaker rate (Lei et al., 2005).
Other heterogeneously expressed currents have been suggested to
also contribute to SAN automaticity, such as the current passed
by transient receptor potential-canonical (TRPC) channels (Ju
et al., 2007) and a sustained inward current (Ist) (Zhang et al.,
2002), which has been postulated to represent the combined
effects of ICaL and current through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger
(INCX) (Lakatta et al., 2010). In fact, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger
plays a fundamental role in SAN automaticity, and even though
it could be included in the membrane clock as it generates a
transmembrane current, it is fundamental in the “Ca2+-clock”
system, so is discussed in the following section.
Another important consideration for SAN activity is the
repolarizing currents, which determine the maximum diastolic
membrane potential (MDP, the most negative occurring
membrane potential), a key driver for If
. The rapid and slow
delayed rectifier K+ currents (IKr and IKs, respectively) are the
primary repolarizing currents in SAN myocytes, with their decay
at the end of the AP allowing for inward cation currents to
cause SDD (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008). Important for the
occurrence of SDD, in primary SAN myocytes there is very
little inward rectifier potassium (K+) current (IK1, passed by
Kir2.1-2.4 channels) (Chandler et al., 2009), which in working
myocytes stabilizes diastolic membrane potential at a resting
value of ∼ –90 mV. It has also been suggested that the Ca2+-
activated K+ channel current (IK,Ca) may be important for
the early portion of SDD by maintaining MDP, and thus the
driving force for If
, as their blockade can result in bradycardia
or complete suppression of excitation (Weisbrod et al., 2016).
There is evidence of other K+ currents in SAN myocytes that may
contribute to repolarization, including: the transient outward
K
+ current (Ito); the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K+ current
(IKur); the acetylcholine (ACh)-activated K+ current (IKACh); and
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ current (IK,ATP)
(Chandler et al., 2009). In addition, the inwardly rectifying
chloride current (ICl), which is activated late during the upstroke,
as well as current through the Na+-K+ ATPase (which extrudes
three Na+ ions while bringing two K+ ions into the cell,
thus generating a net outward current) may contribute to SAN
repolarization and the MDP (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008).
Ca2+-Clock
Intracellular Ca2+ cycling has been shown to be a fundamental
contributor to SAN automaticity. During late SDD in SAN
myocytes, there are localized spontaneous and/or Cav1.3-
triggered sub-sarcolemmal Ca2+ releases from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are in
close proximity to the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Lakatta et al.,
2010; Torrente et al., 2016). These local Ca2+ releases are large
in size and duration and rhythmic in nature (unlike Ca2+
sparks emerging from the SR in ventricular cells, which are

smaller, stochastic events, Sirenko et al., 2013), and result in a
depolarizing current as 1 Ca2+ ion is extruded from the cell
in exchange for 3 Na+ ions through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger
(INCX) (Lakatta et al., 2008). The importance of this mechanism
for SAN firing has been demonstrated by INCX blockade in
guinea pig and rabbit SAN myocytes (Bogdanov et al., 2001,
2006; Sanders et al., 2006), as well as by inhibition of RyR in
guinea pig (Rigg et al., 2000), rabbit (Hata et al., 1996; Satoh,
1997; Bogdanov et al., 2001; Bucchi et al., 2007; Lyashkov et al.,
2007), mouse (Masumiya et al., 2003; Ju et al., 2007; Nikmaram
et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009), and dog (Vinogradova et al., 2006;
Joung et al., 2009). As a result, the rate and size of local Ca2+
releases, and the balance between Ca2+ reuptake into the SR
[through the SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump] and extrusion
through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger are key determinants of the
rate of diastolic depolarization. Importantly, SAN myocytes have
a higher basal level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),
and thus protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of
Ca2+-handling proteins than working myocytes, resulting in a
greater level of SR Ca2+ cycling, which facilitates Ca2+ clock
function (Vinogradova et al., 2006). It has also been shown
that SAN myocytes have higher basal levels of Ca2+/calmodulin
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) compared to working
myocytes, resulting in higher basal phosphorylation of L-type
Ca2+ channels, RyR, and phospholamban (PLB), which when
unphosphorylated inhibits SERCA (Vinogradova et al., 2000;
Li et al., 2016).
Coupled-Clock
The membrane- and Ca2
-clocks together form a cohesive and
robust system for SAN automaticity. Their coupling occurs via
effects of one on the other and through the mutual entrainment
of sarcolemmal ion channel activity and Ca2+ cycling by
intracellular regulatory mechanisms (Lakatta et al., 2008). For
instance, clock-coupling occurs as membrane repolarization by
K
+ channels (key to the membrane-clock) both activates If
and affects intracellular Ca2+ balance (and in turn the Ca2+

clock) via voltage-dependent effects on ICaL and INCX (Lakatta
et al., 2010). Vice versa, INCX (essential for the Ca2+-clock)
directly affects membrane potential (and thus voltage-dependent
components of the membrane-clock) (Bogdanov et al., 2006).
This also highlights that some currents, such as ICaL and INCX,
are important components of both clocks, such that they are
intricately linked. The fidelity of clock coupling is altered through
simultaneous modifications of components within each system.
For instance, neurohumoral alteration of PKA phosphorylation
levels [through changes in adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, the
protein that converts ATP into cAMP] entrains the two clocks
(Mattick et al., 2007; Vinogradova and Lakatta, 2009). In guinea
pig and rabbit, this has been shown to be enhanced by Ca2+-
activated isoforms of AC (important for basal AC activity in the
absence of β-AR stimulation) found in SAN, but not working
myocytes, which also acts to drive intracellular clock-coupling
(Mattick et al., 2007; Younes et al., 2008).
And yet, one should note that oscillatory behavior, as occurs
in the SAN, can result from a combination of activities that
themselves are not oscillatory. In fact, neither If
, nor INCX,
nor the decay of IK can in itself produce the oscillations in
membrane potential that are key to the rhythmic excitation of the
SAN. It is only their combined, out-of-phase activity that allows
for SAN automaticity. Even ion fluxes not typically considered
“pacemaker currents” are essential coupled-clock components,
such as the flux generated by the Na+-K+ ATPase, which helps
maintain electrochemical gradients and ionic homeostasis, which
are crucial for SAN pacemaking (Sirenko et al., 2016). Thus,
SAN automaticity may continue even with the loss of one (or
more) of the currents described above, although important for
the subject of this review, this may result in the loss of important
neurohumoral control mechanisms.
Species Differences in SAN Function
While the mechanisms of SAN automaticity described above
are well conserved, there exist species-specific differences in
SAN function potentially important for neurohumoral control
of HR, which may provide some explanation for inconsistencies
of experimental results. For instance, the range of basal HR
across mammals is large, with an inverse relation to animal
weight (Opthof, 2001). The normal resting HR of mouse
is approximately 10-fold faster than human (∼700 vs. 70
beats/min), whereas rabbit falls somewhere between (∼250
beats/min). This is in part related to differences in the
balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
control of the SAN. Although activation of both branches
of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) alter HR in all
species studied, there are species-differences in the relative
contribution of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches
to basal HR. Specifically, in mouse and rat, resting HR
is predominantly determined by sympathetic tone (Adachi
et al., 2013), whereas in large animals, such as dog and
human, HR is mostly determined by basal parasympathetic
activity (Opthof, 2001). The predominance of sympathetic
activity in mouse and rat is driven primarily by a need
for non-shivering thermogenesis (via sympathetic stimulation
of brown fat) when acclimated to room temperature, to
maintain core body temperature (Axsom et al., 2019). At
thermoneutral temperatures (∼30◦C) sympathetic activity is
reduced, unmasking parasympathetic input and significantly
lowering HR (Axsom et al., 2019). Characteristics of the SAN AP
also differ across species. In mouse, AP duration is ∼80 ms, in
rabbit it is ∼200 ms, and in human it is ∼300 ms (Opthof, 2001).
These differences in AP duration suggest relative differences
in ionic current densities. It is known, for instance that while
IK1 is almost entirely not present in rabbit SAN myocytes, it
is active in some (but not all) mouse SAN pacemaker cells,
although still with a much smaller current than in working
cardiomyocytes (Cho et al., 2003). Further, differences in ionic
current densities could relate to differences in post-translational
modifications or activation and inactivation kinetics of various
currents across species.

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
Important species-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+
handling also exist. In rabbit SAN myocytes it has been
shown that Ca2+ release from the SR via RyR during SDD
is spontaneous (Bogdanov et al., 2001), while in mouse Ca2+
release is instead trigged by Cav1.3-mediated ICaL (Torrente
et al., 2016), and in cat by voltage-dependent activation of
T-type Ca2+ channels (Hüser et al., 1996). In fact, α1D (which
is the pore forming subunit of Cav1.3) L-type Ca2+ channels
are present exclusively in the atria of mouse, rat, rabbit, and
human and are thought to contribute to SDD, based on their
activation at more negative membrane potentials than the most
predominantly expressed L-type Ca2+ channel (with the α1C
pore-forming subunit), which is found throughout the heart
(Mangoni et al., 2003; Qu et al., 2004). Removal of Ca2+ from
the cytosol also differs, as in mouse and rat ∼92% of Ca2+ is
pumped back into the SR by SERCA and only ∼7% is extruded
through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, whereas in rabbit and human
only 70% returns to the SR and 28% is extruded from the cell
(Bers, 2000). As a result, INCX and its contribution to SDD is
greater in rabbit/human than mouse/rat.
NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND
NEUROPEPTIDES
The SAN is strongly influenced by the ANS, with a variety of
neurotransmitters [catecholamines such as norepinephrine (NE)
and epinephrine, ACh, histamine, serotonin (5-HT)], as well
as a host of neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide,
calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, and
somatostatin) released by neurons in the heart that alter SAN
activity and thus HR (Gordan et al., 2015).
In general, these substances bind to a GPCR, causing a
conformational change in its cytoplasmic domains, which
activates its subunits (Gα and Gβγ) (Oldham and Hamm,
2008; Rosenbaum et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015). The Gα
isoforms of primary importance in the SAN are Gαs
, Gαi/o,
and Gαq/11 (Marin-Garcia, 2011). In the “stimulatory” Gαs
pathway, activation of AC increases cAMP, which directly or
indirectly (via PKA activation and subsequent phosphorylation)
activates downstream targets (Gordan et al., 2015). When
the “inhibitory” Gαi/o pathway is initiated, either Gαi or
Gαo binds and inhibits AC, decreasing cAMP levels and
preventing PKA activation (Gordan et al., 2015). Activation
of Gαq/11 on the other hand does not alter cAMP levels, but
instead either Gαq or Gα11 activates phospholipase C (PLC),
which breaks down phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate
(IP3), both of which affect multiple downstream targets
(Marin-Garcia, 2011). And while the Gα subunits initiate
the primary signaling cascades, Gβγ subunits may also be
involved (Zhang et al., 2015). Another important signaling
pathway in SAN myocytes occurs through particulate or
soluble guanylyl cylcase (GC) activation, which results in cGMP
activation and modulation of downstream targets by protein
kinase G (PKG) or other downstream regulatory molecules
(Zaccolo and Movsesian, 2007).
Catecholamines
Catecholamines (NE and epinephrine) are released from
sympathetic neurons of the ANS (Gordan et al., 2015) (although
both are also produced by the adrenal gland and can act as
circulating hormones, or can be intrinsically generated by cells
within the SAN) (Marin-Garcia, 2011; Moen et al., 2019). NE and
epinephrine bind to α- and β-adrenergic receptors (AR). There
are four subtypes of β-AR: β1-AR are the most abundant in the
heart (75–80%); β2-AR are expressed in the heart, but to a much
smaller extent than β1-AR, and are mostly compartmentalized
in caveolae (Rybin et al., 2000); β3-AR are only minimally
expressed in the heart; and β4-AR have not yet been thoroughly
characterized (Madamanchi, 2007).
β1-AR are coupled to Gs proteins, so initiate the stimulatory
AC/cAMP/PKA cascade (Figure 2), which has been shown
to be essential for the increase in HR during adrenergic
stimulation in rabbit SAN myocytes (Behar et al., 2016).
β1-AR stimulation in the SAN increases HR through Gαs￾activation of AC, resulting in an increase in cAMP and PKA,
which modulate the activity of various intracellular targets
(Gordan et al., 2015). The combined action on these targets
causes an increase in the rate of SDD, thus increasing SAN
firing (Figure 1). For instance, in rabbit SAN myocytes the
binding of cAMP to C-terminals of HCN channels causes a
depolarizing shift in their activation kinetics, increasing open
probability and If
(DiFrancesco and Tortora, 1991; Barbuti
and DiFrancesco, 2008). At the same time, PKA increases If
by a phosphorylation-driven shift of its voltage-dependence
of activation, as shown in mouse SAN myocytes (Liao et al.,
2010). Although it is still not entirely clear whether cAMP and
PKA work synergistically or independently on If during β1-
AR stimulation, it is clear that they both cause an increase
in HR (Larsson, 2010). Further, inhibition of If
results in
a moderate decrease in the effect of β-AR stimulation in
rabbit (Noma et al., 1983; Vinogradova et al., 2002), mouse
(Choate and Feldman, 2003), and rat (Yamamoto et al., 2006),
demonstrating its key contribution to the chronotropic response.
Yet, while it is apparent that an alteration in If during β1-
AR stimulation modulates HR, it is still increased by β1-
AR stimulation in animals in which HCN is deficient or
absent, suggesting that other mechanisms are also involved
(Vinogradova and Lakatta, 2009).
PKA also phosphorylates numerous other coupled-clock
components contributing to SDD. Phosphorylation of the α1
subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels, purified from bovine hearts,
increases their open probability, thus increasing current (De
Jongh et al., 1996). It has also been shown that the Gαs
subunit can directly stimulate L-type Ca2+ channels (Yatani
et al., 1988) (T-type Ca2+ channels, on the other hand, are
not affected by β1-AR stimulation in rabbit SAN myocytes,
Hagiwara et al., 1988). Delayed-rectifier K+ channels show an
increase in rate of deactivation and an increase in current
amplitude following β1-AR stimulation in rabbit SAN myocytes,
contributing to the increase in HR (Lei et al., 2000). β1-AR
activation also increases Na+-K+ ATPase activity, which is
an important compensatory mechanism for the maintenance
of ionic homeostasis during increases in membrane currents

(Shimoni, 1999) and it modulates INa and ICl, however, the
mechanism and the significance of this is uncertain, and likely
neither of these contribute in a significant way to the β1-AR￾related increase in HR (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008). It has also
been shown that there are phosphorylation sites on the Na+-
Ca2+ exchanger, yet whether its phosphorylation occurs or is
functionally relevant following β1-AR stimulation in the SAN
remains unknown (Vinogradova and Lakatta, 2009).
Although some groups exclusively emphasize the role of
effects on sarcolemmal currents in increased HR during β1-
AR activation (Bucchi et al., 2007; Himeno et al., 2008), there
is also evidence demonstrating a role of alterations in Ca2+-
clock components in the response (Lyashkov et al., 2018).
Specifically, the effect of RyR inhibition by ryanodine on the
chronotropic response following β1-AR stimulation has been
extensively studied in a multitude of species. In rabbit SAN cells,
β1-AR activation increases the frequency and amplitude of local
Ca2+ releases during SDD, which increases INCX, the rate of SDD,
and in turn, AP frequency. This effect is eliminated when RyR
are inhibited by ryanodine, despite a preserved increase in L-type
Ca2+ current amplitude (Vinogradova et al., 2002). Although
this result suggests that the target of β1-AR activation is indeed
the Ca2+-clock, another study in rabbit SAN has suggested that
the alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis by RyR suppression has
an indirect effect on HR, by disrupting the increase in cAMP
near HCN channels (Bucchi et al., 2003). Either way, studies
in the mouse (Wu et al., 2009), guinea pig (Rigg et al., 2000),
and dog (Vinogradova et al., 2006; Joung et al., 2009) have all
demonstrated that suppression of RyR with ryanodine diminishes
the chronotropic response to β1-AR stimulation, indicating a
critical role for Ca2+ release from the SR. β1-AR activation
also increases PLB phosphorylation in SAN cells (Vinogradova
et al., 2006), releasing its inhibition on SERCA and causing more
rapid Ca2+ re-uptake into the SR (Marin-Garcia, 2011), which
increases SR Ca2+ content.
Basal levels of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR,
PLB, and L-type Ca2+ channels are present in rabbit (but
not mouse) SAN myocytes (Vinogradova et al., 2000; Wu and
Anderson, 2014; Li et al., 2016), suggesting a species-dependence
of the role that CaMKII plays in the maintenance of basal
HR. In both mouse and rabbit, however, CAMKII is important
under physiological stress, with CAMKII levels increased by
sympathetic stimulation (Wu and Anderson, 2014). For instance,
when CaMKII is inhibited, mice are less responsive to β1-AR
stimulation (Wu et al., 2009).
While sympathetic stimulation in the SAN primarily acts
through β1-AR, automaticity may also be affected by activation
of β2-, β3-, and α1-AR (Marin-Garcia, 2011). β2-AR are coupled
to both Gαs and Gαi subunits, activating the Gαs cascade under
normal physiological conditions, but under other conditions
can switch to the Gαi cascade (Paur et al., 2012; Machuki
et al., 2018). For example, when high levels of epinephrine
are released from the adrenal gland during stress, binding to
β2-AR initially activates the Gαs subunit (as demonstrated in
ventricular myocytes), triggering the same signaling pathways
as β1-AR stimulation, thus increasing HR (Figure 2). The
resulting PKA produced by this signaling cascade, however,
phosphorylates the receptor, initiating a switch from Gαs to
Gαi activation (Fischmeister et al., 2006). Once the Gαi subunit
is activated, AC activity is inhibited, decreasing intracellular
cAMP, PKA, and HR (Madamanchi, 2007). In the SAN, these
actions are facilitated by the co-localization of β2-AR with
HCN4 channels in caveolae, thus restricting the increase in
cAMP to specifically modulate If
[the close proximity of the
receptor and the effector allows for this compartmentalization by
phosphodiesterases (PDEs)] (Barbuti and DiFrancesco, 2008). In
contrast, in the piglet and rat SAN it has been shown that β2-AR
are important in mediating the response to NE and epinephrine
independent of PDE compartmentalization (Christ et al., 2009;
Galindo-Tovar et al., 2010).

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
β3-AR have also not been thoroughly studied in the SAN
and therefore the role they play in HR modulation is uncertain.
One complicating factor is that different isoforms of β3-
AR have been shown to differentially couple to Gαs or Gαi
,
although the existence of β3-AR isoforms have not been
characterized in the heart (Machuki et al., 2018). Furthermore,
likely due to the variable G-protein binding abilities of β3-AR,
responses to β3-AR agonists are variable throughout the heart
(Dessy and Balligand, 2010).
Catecholamines also bind to α-AR in the heart. α-AR are
coupled to Gq/11-proteins, which activate PLC (Jensen et al.,
2014), causing hydrolysis of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG (Marin￾Garcia, 2011). When IP3 binds to IP3R on the SR membrane, this
causes release of Ca2+, increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels, which
causes the further release of Ca2+ from the SR through RyR
(Marin-Garcia, 2011). Three IP3R isoforms have been identified
in the mouse SAN, and it has been shown that their activation
can modulate automaticity via Ca2+-dependent mechanisms (Ju
et al., 2011, 2012; Kapoor et al., 2015). DAG, on the other
hand activates PKC, which phosphorylates various targets such
as L-type Ca2+ channels and the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Baker,
2014). Yet some studies of the effects of α-AR in the SAN are
conflicting. For instance, in isolated SAN from both young and
adult rabbits, phenylephrine (which activates α-AR) does not
alter HR (Hewett and Rosen, 1985). Despite this result, greater
expression of α-AR occurs in the SAN compared to surrounding
myocardium in rat, suggesting a role for α-AR in HR control
(Saito et al., 1994).
The control of HR by the sympathetic ANS is well documented
in humans, as stimulation of sympathetic neurons in the
human SAN increase HR and blockade of sympathetic receptors
decreases HR (James et al., 1970), but many of the mechanistic
details observed in experimental model systems have yet to
be confirmed. β1- and β2-AR are both predominant in the
human SAN, and β2-AR expression is more than two times
higher in the SAN than the surrounding atrial tissue (Rodefeld
et al., 1996). In the isolated human SAN isoproterenol has been
shown to decrease cycle length and shorten AP duration by
increasing the rate of repolarization, while also hyperpolarizing
the MDP, consistent with what has been shown in animal models
(Drouin, 1997). Yet, in contrast to what has been shown in
animals, administration of phenylephrine in human causes either
an increase (a response that is attenuated with age) (Saitoh
et al., 1995) or a decrease in HR (Mary-Rabine et al., 1978;
Drugge et al., 1985).
Acetylcholine
The parasympathetic branch of the ANS counterbalances
sympathetic effects. Parasympathetic neurons release ACh, which
binds to muscarinic receptors in the sarcolemma (Gordan
et al., 2015). There are five muscarinic subtypes that have
been identified, but it is the M2-receptor (M2R) that elicits
the functional response in the human heart (Harvey, 2012). In
the SAN, ACh activation of M2R (a GPCR) leads to decreased
HR as it is coupled to Gi-proteins (Figure 3; Harvey, 2012).
In rabbit SAN myocytes, this decrease in HR is associated
with a negative shift of MDP, a decrease in SDD rate, and
FIGURE 3 | Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2-R) signaling cascade in a

an increase in AP duration (Verkerk et al., 2012; Figure 1).
Multiple M2R-mediated pathways have been shown in rabbit
SAN cells to produce these effects over different time scales
and with different ACh concentrations: activation of IKACh,
inhibition of If
, and inhibition of Ca2+-clock components (Accili
et al., 1998). IKACh is the fastest-muscarinic pathway, with the
response occurring in less than 2 s in rabbit SAN cells, as
no cytosolic components are required for current activation
(Accili et al., 1998). Specifically, again in rabbit SAN cells,
when ACh binds M2R the Gβγ subunit activates G-protein
regulated K+ (GIRK) channels, with the ensuing efflux of K+
causing a negative shift of MDP, slowing HR (Renaudon et al.,
1997). GIRK1 and GIRK4 are both expressed in the heart
and work together to form the channel (two α-subunits of
each isoform) (Marin-Garcia, 2011), although in the human
SAN GIRK expression is heterogeneous, with GIRK4 expression
being highest in the center of the SAN (Li et al., 2017).
Interestingly, SAN myocytes from GIRK4 knockout (KO) mice
have a similar basal HR compared to control, but GIRK4 is
indispensable for the generation of IKACh, which accounts for
approximately half of the HR reduction provoked by vagal
stimulation (Wickman et al., 1998).
While direct binding of the Gβγ subunit to GIRK elicits
a response, multiple mechanisms for how this activates the
channel have been proposed, based on data from Xenopus
oocytes. One suggestion is that GIRK channels are intrinsically
inhibited by a terminal domain of GIRK1 protein and binding
of Gβγ removes inhibition and opens the channel (Reuveny
et al., 1994). Another is that GIRK is activated by PIP2, but
with a low sensitivity, and that Gβγ binding increases the
affinity of GIRK for PIP2, thus increasing current activation

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
(Huang et al., 1998). It is unclear, however, why the Gβγ subunit
of Gs proteins do not activate IKACh (Marin-Garcia, 2011).
This lack of response may be due to compartmentalization
of M2R and GIRK channels, but this possibility requires
further investigation.
The slower components causing decreased HR upon M2R
activation are second messenger cascades. The activated Gαi
subunit reduces AC activity in rabbit SAN cells, resulting in
decreased cAMP levels, fewer active HCN channels (due to a
negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation of If
),
and a reduction in the SDD slope (Accili et al., 1998; Van
Borren et al., 2010). Activation of M2R with carbachol in rabbit
SAN myocytes has been shown to have a dose-dependent effect
on PLB phosphorylation and Ca2+-cycling via a Gi-dependent
pathway (Lyashkov et al., 2009). The negative chronotropic
effect of ACh was shown to be dependent upon cAMP/PKA￾dependent phosphorylation both in single rabbit SAN cells and
in a computational rabbit SAN cell model, through effects on
multiple components of the coupled-clock system (Yaniv et al.,
2013; Behar et al., 2016). At low concentrations carbachol has
been shown to decrease HR without activating IKACh, acting
only via a cAMP-mediated, PKA-dependent suppression of Ca2+
signaling (Lyashkov et al., 2009). With higher concentrations,
carbachol additionally decreases HR via activation of IKACh
(Lyashkov et al., 2009). These data demonstrate the importance
of Ca2+ -clock suppression in the reduction in HR. Activation
of M2R has also been shown to be coupled with NO synthesis,
mediated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) (Han et al., 1994b).
NO generation activates GC receptors, causing an increase in
cGMP levels, PDE2 activation, inhibition of cAMP, reduced
L-type Ca2+ channel phosphorylation, and ultimately decreased
ICaL (Han et al., 1995). Overall, the combination of the direct
effects of M2R stimulation, including a more negative MDP due
to IKACh activation and a slower SDD due to reduced If and Ca2+
cycling, along with indirect NO/cGMP-mediated effects, leads to
a decrease in HR in response to ACh release.
Although a vast amount of research has been done regarding
the intracellular mechanisms for parasympathetic control of HR
in the SAN of many experimental animals, the translation to
humans is somewhat lacking. It is known that M2R density
is nearly three times higher in the human SAN compared
to surrounding atrial myocardium (Rodefeld et al., 1996) and
that GIRK protein expression follows a similar trend (Li
et al., 2017). In human isolated SAN, ACh increases cycle
length and negatively shifts the MDP (Drouin, 1997). Direct
stimulation of parasympathetic ganglia innervating the human
SAN similarly causes a cycle length prolongation (Quan et al.,
1999), and anticholinergic drugs slow HR (Nwazue et al., 2014).
Although the HR effect of parasympathetic ANS activity is
well characterized in human, some of the specific mechanisms
demonstrated in animal models remain unconfirmed due to
limitations of experimentation. This has been supplemented by
the use of human-specific SAN cell computational models, which
suggest that the voltage-dependence of M2R has significant effects
on SDD, and that changes in the voltage-sensitivity of M2R may
provide a mechanistic explanation for the increased sensitivity to
changes in vagal tone in certain disease states (Moss et al., 2018).
Histamine
Histamine released from neurons acts as a neurotransmitter
but can also act as a hormone when released from mast cells
and basophils in the heart (Marin-Garcia, 2011). There are
four types of histamine receptors, all of which are GPCRs,
with H1R coupled to the Gq/11 pathway activating PLC, H2R
coupled to the Gs cascade activating cAMP and PKA, and
both H3R and H4R coupled to Gi signaling (Hattori et al.,
2004). Histamine receptor expression is highly variable across
species and cardiac tissues, and although both H1R and H2R
are expressed in the atria of rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and
human hearts, H2R is most abundant and dominates cardiac
responses (Matsuda et al., 2004), including in the SAN, where
H2R stimulation increases HR via increased cAMP and PKA
levels (Kevelaitis et al., 1994; Hattori et al., 2004). In rabbit
SAN tissue this increase in HR is associated with a shift in
the primary pacemaker site (Kevelaitis et al., 1994). In rabbit
isolated SAN myocytes, histamine increases firing via H2R
activation, and at high concentrations induces arrhythmias
(Satoh, 1993). Interestingly, resident cardiac mast cells, the
main supply of histamine in the heart, predominantly reside in
close proximity to the SAN (Nistri et al., 2008). When these
mast cells become activated due to an inflammatory response,
such as during acute myocardial infarction or septic shock,
they release histamine, which has been shown to cause severe
tachyarrhythmias in pigs (Matsuda et al., 2004; Nistri et al.,
2008). Yet, the role of histamine in the heart is complex, as
activation of H3R can inhibit the arrhythmogenic increase in
NE release from sympathetic nerve terminals that is associated
with ischemia (Levi and Smith, 2000). Not only does histamine
alter HR during an inflammatory response, it also has been
shown to increase HR in the initial stages of digestion in
pythons, a useful model system for postprandial tachycardia due
to the magnitude and infrequency of their meals (Skovgaard
et al., 2009). Although these studies and the varying receptor
subtypes, signaling cascades, and receptor locations (both across
tissue types and in nerve terminals) demonstrate the potential
for a subtle and more complex role for histamine in HR
control, the positive chronotropic effect via H2R stimulation
is the most commonly reported finding, particularly in human
(Wolff and Levi, 1986; Hu et al., 1997; Hattori et al., 2004;
Matsuda et al., 2004). In fact, it has been suggested that that
administration of H2R inhibitors could be used to decrease HR
following autonomic blockade in people with SAN dysfunction
(Hu et al., 1997).
Serotonin
The chronotropic response to serotonin (5-HT) is complex,
as it binds to many different receptor types, both directly
on cardiac tissue and also on autonomic nerve terminals,
causing bradycardia, tachycardia, or sometimes both (Linden
et al., 1999). There are at least fourteen different receptor
types expressed in the heart which elicit inconsistent responses
(Saxena and Villalon, 1990).
Many experimental studies have shown 5-HT to cause
a decrease in HR. Intravenously administered 5-HT in the

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
rat, rabbit, cat, ferret, dog, cow, and guinea pig causes an
acute decrease in HR that can be blocked by vagotomy or
atropine (James, 1964; Kaumann and Levy, 2006; Villalón and
Centurión, 2007). This response is largely due to activation of
5-HT3-type receptors on parasympathetic neurons, which
are coupled to a ligand-gated Na+/K+ channel. When
opened, this channel causes depolarization, neurotransmitter
release, and reflex bradycardia (Saxena and Villalon, 1990).
Bradycardia can also be the result of 5-HT binding to 5-HT1
receptors on sympathetic neurons, causing their inhibition,
or on parasympathetic neurons, causing their stimulation
(Villalón and Centurión, 2007).
Conversely, an increase in HR with 5-HT has also been
demonstrated experimentally. For example, in pithed rats, it
has been shown that circulating 5-HT increases HR by binding
to 5-HT2 receptors in the myocardium or on presynaptic
sympathetic neurons (Gothert et al., 1986; Centurion et al.,
2002). The 5-HT2 receptor is a Gq-protein coupled receptor,
and activates the PLC signaling cascade (Villalón and Centurión,
2007). It was also recently shown in rat cardiomyocytes
combined with computational modeling that SERCA can be
serotonylated (receptor-independent activation directly by 5-
HT), which alters SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+ and represents
a potential mechanism for direct effects of 5-HT on SAN
automaticity that warrants further investigation (Wang et al.,
2016). It appears that intravenously administered 5-HT in pig,
on the other hand, causes tachycardia via activation of 5-
HT4 receptors, as inhibition of 5-HT4 abolished this response
(Parker et al., 1995).
In humans, intravenously administered 5-HT has been
shown to both increase or decrease HR, consistent with the
variable response seen in animal models (Page and McCubbin,
1955; Kaumann and Levy, 2006). Although it has not been
demonstrated experimentally, it is likely that bradycardia is the
result of 5-HT3 receptor activation on parasympathetic neurons
as demonstrated in animal models. Contrarily, the tachycardia
is hypothesized to be due to activation of 5-HT4 receptors, as a
number of studies have identified 5-HT4 antagonists that inhibit
the 5-HT induced increase in contractility seen in the human
right atrium (Kaumann et al., 1990, 1991, 1994; Kaumann,
1993; Parker et al., 1995). 5-HT4 receptor activation increases
contractility via an increase in cAMP, and it is feasible that 5-HT
would also increase HR in the SAN through a 5-HT4 receptor
activation mediated increase in cAMP (Kaumann et al., 1991).
This is further supported by the observation that 5-HT4 receptor
activation increases If
in human atrial myocytes, which might
be expected to also occur in SAN myocytes (Pino et al., 1998).
Interestingly, in humans it has also been shown that chronic
treatment with β-blockers increases sensitivity to 5-HT in the
atria, implicating cross-talk between 5-HT4 receptors, β-AR, and
M2R (Sanders et al., 1995). 5-HT has also been implicated in a
vast array of human pathological cardiac conditions, which is
unsurprising given the large number of different receptor types
and their locations (Kaumann and Levy, 2006). Overall, while
many studies have assessed the effect of 5-HT on HR, a consistent
effect on HR in humans and the mechanisms eliciting these
responses remain to be clearly elucidated.
Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide co￾released with ACh from parasympathetic neurons, yet has
the opposite effect of ACh, increasing HR (Mangoni and
Nargeot, 2008). VIP binds to two receptor subtypes, VPAC1
and VPAC2, both of which are GPCRs that activate Gs￾protein cascades, stimulating AC to produce cAMP, which
triggers PKA (Marin-Garcia, 2011). VIP application on rabbit
SAN myocytes and canine Purkinje fibers positively shifts the
activation curve of If
, which increases the rate of SDD and
SAN firing (Chang et al., 1994; Accili et al., 1996). A dose￾dependent increase in HR has been observed in guinea pig
isolated hearts following bolus injections of VIP (Hoover, 1989).
Similarly, when VIP is given intravenously to healthy humans,
there is a dose-dependent increase in HR (Frase et al., 1987).
Yet, still little is known about the role of VIP in human
HR regulation (Henning and Sawmiller, 2001). Because VIP
is released along with ACh but removed more slowly from
the synapse, it is thought to be important for moderating the
ACh-induced decrease in HR, contributing to the tachycardia
seen after vagal stimulation (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008),
and possibly protecting against neutrally mediated bradycardia
(Henning and Sawmiller, 2001). Interestingly, the affinity,
density, responsiveness of VIP receptors changes in heart
failure and hypertension, warranting further investigation of
its role in disease progression and prevention in humans
(Henning and Sawmiller, 2001).
Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating
Polypeptide
Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a
neurotransmitter and modulator which is very closely related
to VIP (Henning and Sawmiller, 2001). It binds to three GPCR
subtypes, two of which are identical to VPAC1 and VPAC2
(Hirose et al., 1997a). In a group of studies done in the dog
(under anesthesia, in the isolated heart, and in the atria), PACAP
caused a biphasic chronotropic response, with an initial increase,
followed by a decrease in HR (Hirose et al., 1997a,b, 1998).
In the anesthetized dog, the PACAP-induced decrease in HR is
abolished following M2R blockade, indicating that the change
in HR is likely due to activation of parasympathetic nerves
(Hirose et al., 1997a). Interestingly, in the dog it appears that
the increase in HR with PACAP is not mediated through β-ARs
(as the response is not attenuated by β-AR blockade), but is due
to activation of PACAP receptors directly on the tissue (Hirose
et al., 1997a). The specific intracellular pathways eliciting this
response remain unknown, however, in other tissues PACAP
has been reported to increase cAMP, which could explain the
positive chronotropic response. Conversely, in the anesthetized
rat, HR increases with PACAP administration and the response
is abolished by β-AR blockade, indicating that in this species the
positive chronotropic response is mediated by neuromodulation
of sympathetic neurons, rather than a direct effect on SAN tissue
(Whalen et al., 1999). Although not much is known about the role
of PACAP in the human SAN, in two separate studies on young,

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
healthy humans, PACAP caused an increase in HR (Dorner et al.,
1998; Birk et al., 2007).
Neuropeptide Y
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is co-localized with NE and expressed
by sympathetic neurons innervating the cardiovascular system
(Marin-Garcia, 2011). NPY binds to a group of GPCRs (Y1,
Y2, and Y5) which activate the Gi/o signaling cascade (Marin￾Garcia, 2011). Chronotropic responses vary across species and
experimental preparations, with NPY having been shown to
cause inconsistent changes in HR (Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998).
NPY pre-synaptically inhibits NE release from sympathetic
neurons, but can also potentiate post-synaptic effects of NE,
therefore working both with and against sympathetic nervous
system stimulation of the SAN (Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998).
In embryonic chick ventricular myocytes, NPY increases
spontaneous firing frequency by increasing stimulation of L-type
Ca2+ channels via activation of Y1 receptors (Jacques and Abdel￾Samad, 2007). An increase in firing rate is observed with NPY
application in guinea pig isolated atria and rat isolated hearts
(Lundberg et al., 1984; Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998). Conversely,
in canine Purkinje fibers, NPY reduces If
(either via a decrease
in maximal If conductance or via If current blockade, rather
than altering the voltage-dependence) causing decreased HR
(Chang et al., 1994). Similarly, in anesthetized cats, NPY injection
causes a decrease in HR (Minkes et al., 1989). In Langendorff
perfused rabbit hearts and in anesthetized dogs no change in
HR is observed with NPY application (Allen et al., 1983; Rigel,
1988). Differences in experimental models might explain some
of these differences, however, the specific actions of NPY on
SAN myocytes requires further investigation. Very little is known
about the impact of NPY on the human SAN. A correlation
between endogenous NPY and tachycardia was found in adults
with heart failure, however, whether this correlation is causative
or the change in HR is a confounding variable is unknown
(Hulting et al., 1990). Contrarily, in children with vasovagal
syncope no correlation was found between NPY levels and HR
(Liao et al., 2017). NPY has been investigated broadly for its role
in many cardiovascular diseases, but regarding its effect on HR in
human, further investigation is needed.
Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been shown to
increase HR in many different expression systems, however,
whether it is acting directly on the SAN to alter HR and/or as
a neuromodulator with indirect chronotropic effects is unclear
(Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998). Tachycardia has been observed
in response to intravenous administration of CGRP in many
species including the rat, rabbit, dog, and in humans (Bell and
McDermott, 1996). In neonatal rat isolated cardiomyocytes and
rat and guinea pig isolated right atria CGRP increases beating
rate, and in rats intravenous CGRP increases HR even in the
presence of autonomic antagonists, suggesting a direct action of
CGRP on the SAN (Marshall et al., 1986; Fisher et al., 1988).
Conversely, despite HR being increased following intravenous
administration of CGRP in the rabbit, in rabbit isolated right
atria no change in beating rate is observed, suggesting an
effect on ANS ganglia rather than directly on SAN myocytes
(Holman et al., 1986). In the dog, CGRP also seems to act as a
neuromodulator, as when given intravenously it does not affect
HR at baseline, but does attenuate the reduction of HR with
vagal stimulation, a response that is abolished by sympathectomy
and parasympathectomy (Rigel et al., 1989). In humans, a higher
amount of CGRP is found in the atria than ventricles, and in
the SAN than the rest of the atria, with CGRP binding sites
found throughout the heart (Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998). In
three different clinical studies, two involving healthy individuals
and one with patients in heart failure, intravenously administered
CGRP increased HR, even in the presence of adrenergic receptor
blockade (Struthers et al., 1986; Franco-Cereceda et al., 1987;
Gennari et al., 1990). However, whether the CGRP-mediated
increase in HR in humans is exclusively due to the direct
action on the SAN or if CGRP also modulates HR through
neuromodulation of ANS ganglia requires further investigation.
Neurotensin
Neurotensin is a neuromodulator with many targets within the
brain, but also the heart, including the SAN (Marin-Garcia,
2011). Neurotensin receptor subtypes NTS1 and NTS2 are
expressed in the heart and both are GPCRs (Osadchii, 2015).
NTS1 has been shown to activate PLC and PKA through the
Gq/11 and Gs signaling pathways, respectively (Marin-Garcia,
2011). It has been hypothesized that neurotensin modulates
cardiovascular responses primarily via NTS1 (Osadchii, 2015).
Neurotensin has been shown to increase HR in anesthetized rat,
guinea pig, and cat, and in guinea pig isolated hearts and atria
(Osadchii, 2015). The increase in HR in both the anesthetized
guinea pig and the guinea pig isolated heart was not abolished
even in the presence of a multitude of autonomic antagonists,
suggesting that neurotensin can act directly on the SAN, not
simply by altering neuronal activation (Bachelard et al., 1985;
Rioux et al., 1989). Conversely, in the anesthetized rat the
response was abolished by adrenergic blockade, suggesting the
response may be neurally mediated (Chahl and Walker, 1981).
Although it’s feasible to predict that neurotensin would also
increase HR in humans, through either direct action on the SAN
or on ANS ganglia within the atria, currently no data exists. As
levels of endogenous neurotensin increase in some pathological
conditions it is of potential importance to establish the impact of
neurotensin on the human SAN.
Somatostatin
Similar to the other neuropeptides described above, somatostatin
may act both directly on cardiovascular tissue through its own
receptors, while also modulating the release of catecholamines
or ACh from autonomic neurons (Marin-Garcia, 2011).
Somatostatin activates five GPCRs, all of which stimulate the Gi/o
pathway, and some of which also activate Gq/11 cascades (Marin￾Garcia, 2011). In snake isolated atrial preparations somatostatin
causes a decrease in HR (Donald et al., 1990). Similarly, in a
clinical study involving patients admitted for unexplained heart
palpitations, intravenous somatostatin decreased HR (Bubinski
et al., 1994). It is unclear if this effect is due to the direct action
of somatostatin on SAN myocytes or through modulation of

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
autonomic inputs to the SAN. No other data regarding the
chronotropic effect of somatostatin on HR exists, and therefore
this is an area requiring further investigation.
AUTOCRINE, PARACRINE, AND
ENDOCRINE FACTORS
Various peptides, such as the neuropeptides described above,
are important modulators of HR. Many are produced by cells
within the heart, acting as autocrine and paracrine factors, while
others are produced elsewhere (e.g., in the brain, kidneys, liver,
or vasculature) and reach the heart through the circulation, thus
acting as endocrine factors (Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998). Their
importance for HR regulation is an active area of investigation,
and crucial for a complete understanding of SAN control by
neurohumoral agents.
Natriuretic Peptides
Natriuretic peptides (NP) are a family of peptide hormones
that are important in cardiovascular physiology and disease.
There are four NP family members: atrial NP (ANP); brain
NP (BNP); C-type NP (CNP), and Dendroaspis NP (DNP)
(Moghtadaei et al., 2016). NP can be produced and stored in
atrial myocytes and released during atrial stretch or produced
and released from cardiac fibroblasts. All four NPs are present
in the circulation, but NP concentrations are much higher in the
myocardium than the circulation, due to their local production
and perform autocrine and paracrine functions. NP bind to three
NP receptors (NPR): NPR-A; NPR-B; and NPR-C, all of which are
expressed in the SAN. ANP, BNP, and DNP all bind to NPR-A,
whereas only CNP binds to NPR-B. Both NPR-A and NPR￾B are particulate (membrane bound) GC receptors, meaning
ligand binding to the extracellular NPR activates intracellular
GC enzymes and increases intracellular cGMP concentrations
(Figure 4). cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG) and PDE2
and inhibits PDE3. PKG can phosphorylate many components of
SAN automaticity, while PDEs hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP and
are therefore important modulators of cyclic nucleotide activity.
Unlike the other NPR subtypes, NPR-C is not a GC receptor
but an atypical GPCR with a single transmembrane domain
(unlike a classical GPCR with seven transmembrane domains)
that activates a specific Gi-protein signaling cascade that inhibits
AC, thus decreasing cAMP levels.
Numerous studies have been performed using various animal
models to assess the chronotropic effects of NP. ANP has been
shown to decrease HR in rat and not effect HR in dog, BNP
has been shown to increase HR in mouse and not effect HR
in mouse and dog, and CNP has been shown to increase HR
in dog and mouse (Moghtadaei et al., 2016). BNP and CNP
increase HR by increasing If and ICaL and shifting the voltage
dependence of activation of both currents (Springer et al.,
2012). Interestingly, the effects of BNP and CNP on If and
ICaL are indistinguishable between NPR-C KO and wild-type
mice, revealing that activation of NPR-C does not modulate
automaticity under basal conditions. Conversely, blocking NPR￾A or inhibiting PDE3 both abolish the effects of BNP or CNP
on If and ICaL (Springer et al., 2012). These data indicate that
under basal conditions, BNP and CNP increase HR by way of
NPR-A and NPR-B (not NPR-C), by activating GC, increasing
cytosolic cGMP, and inhibiting PDE3, all of which lead to higher
cAMP concentrations. In guinea pig SAN myocytes, application
of ANP causes an increase in IKs through an increase in cGMP
(Shimizu et al., 2002). Together, these results indicate that under
basal conditions, NPR-A and NPR-B activation have a greater
influence on SAN automaticity than NPR-C.
Although under basal conditions NPR-C specific agonist
cANF does not affect HR, in the presence of a β-AR agonist, NPR￾C signaling becomes important. Specifically, activation of NPR-C
by cANF decreases AP firing in a dose-dependent manner in
SAN myocytes that have been first stimulated with isoproterenol
(Azer et al., 2012). This response is due to modulation of ICaL by
NPR-C/Gi activation causing a reduction in cAMP concentration
in mouse SAN myocytes (Rose et al., 2004), although NPR-C
activation does not modify If
in any way (potentially due to
compartmentalization of receptors and channels in the SAN).
Interestingly, when β-agonist concentrations are high, activation
of β-AR switches the actions of BNP and CNP from increasing
HR to decreasing HR due to increasingly important contributions
of NPR-C to the overall effects of NP (Moghtadaei et al., 2016).
In humans, the response to ANP has been variable. In some
studies, ANP has had no effect on HR (Volpe et al., 1987, 1990;
Crozier et al., 1993), while in others it has either increased
or decreased HR in a dose-dependent manner (Biollaz et al.,
1986; Bussien et al., 1986; Weidmann et al., 1986; Franco-Suarez
et al., 1987; Nicholls and Richards, 1987). Although cellular and
molecular mechanisms of ANP action have not been explored
in the human SAN, in human atrial myocytes ANP has been
shown to increase If and ICaL, likely via an increase in cytosolic
cGMP and cAMP concentrations (Boixel et al., 2001; Lonardo
et al., 2004). The influence, if any, of BNP or CNP on HR has
not been shown in human, although they, along with ANP, are
both found in the circulation and in the myocardium of humans
(Moghtadaei et al., 2016).
So overall, NP plays an important role in controlling HR
via specific modulations of pacemaker components in animal
models, but how this translates to human remains uncertain.
Responses are complicated because of the multiple receptors and
the non-specificity of NPR binding by the various NP. Because
endogenous levels of NP increase under certain pathological
conditions, such as heart failure, it is important to understand
the role they play in SAN function.
Adenosine
Adenosine is a purine nucleoside formed from the breakdown
of ATP that controls a plethora of cellular functions in an
autocrine and paracrine fashion in the cardiovascular system,
including in the SAN (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008). Adenosine
shares a similar signaling pathway to M2R and causes decreased
HR in many species including human, dog, rabbit, guinea pig,
rat, and mouse (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008). Adenosine binds
to purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), all of which
are found in the heart (Headrick et al., 2013). A1 and A3
receptors are coupled to Gi and Gq/11 pathways, causing a

decrease in intracellular cAMP, whereas the A2 receptors are
coupled to Gs and cause an increase (Headrick et al., 2013).
However, it is the A1 receptor (A1R) that is attributed to
modulating HR in the SAN (Figure 4). Adenosine application
activates an inwardly rectifying K+ current (IKAdo) that is
mediated by the same G-protein signaling and coupled K+
channels as IKACh (Kir3.1/3.4) (Belardinelli et al., 1988). This
has been demonstrated in the human isolated SAN where
adenosine application decreases HR via A1R-induced GIRK
channel activation, an effect that is abolished by GIRK channel
blockade, implicating that the chronotropic response may be
predominantly due to IKAdo rather than alternative intracellular
pathways and targets (Li et al., 2017). In humans there is greater
expression of both A1R and GIRK4 in the SAN compared to
the adjacent right atrium, suggesting the SAN might be more
sensitive to adenosine than the surrounding tissue (Li et al.,
2017). Interestingly, the sensitivity to adenosine-challenge is
heart-specific, potentially explained by differences in A1R and
GIRK protein expression between hearts. Although in humans
GIRK channel activation is thought to be the main contributor
to decreased HR, in animal models other mechanisms have been
identified. Specifically, in rabbit SAN myocytes, adenosine also
decreases HR through inhibition of ICaL and If
, and causes a
negative shift in the activation of If
, leading to a negative shift
of MDP and a reduced SDD rate (West and Belardinelli, 1985;
Belardinelli et al., 1988). Although activation of A1R by adenosine
reduces HR, it has been shown that A2A gene deletion in mice
also reduces HR, implying that activation of A2A would instead
increase HR. A3 receptor deletion in mice, on the other hand, has
the opposite effect, pointing to a role for A3 receptors in reduced
HR, consistent with A1R (Headrick et al., 2013). And not only
does adenosine contribute to normal daily rhythm control, it has
also been implicated in pathophysiological settings. Upregulation
of A1R has been demonstrated in dogs with induced chronic
heart failure compared to control, which may worsen conduction
abnormalities, leading to SAN dysfunction (Lou et al., 2014).
Adenosine is produced in greater amounts in ischemia and
heart failure, and can cause SAN conduction block and tachy￾bradyarrhythmia in the dog (Lou et al., 2013).
Angiotensin II
The renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in
cardiovascular and fluid homeostasis. Renin converts
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then cleaved by
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) into angiotensin II
(ANGII), which is the main effector molecule (Mehta and
Griendling, 2007). ANGII is an important and far reaching
hormone, as it affects virtually all organs, including the heart,
the kidneys, the vasculature, and the brain, yet knowledge of
its modulatory effects on the SAN is limited and controversial
(Mehta and Griendling, 2007; Sheng et al., 2011). Acutely, ANGII
has been shown to decrease the firing rate of guinea pig SAN
myocytes by a reduction in ICaL and an increase in IKs (Sheng
et al., 2011). Similarly, in rabbit SAN myocytes ANGII decreases
spontaneous firing rate by decreasing ICaL (Habuchi et al., 1995).
However, in anesthetized dogs, ANGII injection increases HR
(Lambert, 1995). This difference could be due to species-specific
effects or related to differences in whole animal and single cell
responses. ANGII acts on angiotensin (AT) receptors, AT1
and AT2, however, it is via AT1 that ANGII modulates the
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 March 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 170

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
SAN (Sechi et al., 1992; Sheng et al., 2011). Signaling pathways
downstream of AT1 are complex, and the mechanisms by which
binding of ANGII to AT1 modulates automaticity is unclear.
ANGII binding to AT1 can activate both Gq/11 and Gi
, as well
as G-protein independent pathways (Mehta and Griendling,
2007). AT1 activation also modulates other receptors in the
plasma membrane and activates signaling molecules such as
MAPK and arachidonic acid (Mehta and Griendling, 2007).
Not only does ANGII act directly on myocytes, it can serve as
a neuromodulator stimulating the release of catecholamines
from sympathetic neurons (Marin-Garcia, 2011). Perhaps the
multiple targets and complex signaling networks downstream of
ANGII activation underlie the varying chronotropic effects seen
in different experimental species and preparations. Interestingly,
ANGII has not been shown to change HR in humans, despite
its well documented role in regulation of blood pressure (Mehta
and Griendling, 2007). Both AT receptors are present in the
human heart, with higher AT2 expression in fetal development
and in failing hearts compared to healthy adult hearts (Mehta
and Griendling, 2007). Although no studies have been done
in human tissue, when given ANGII intravenously no changes
are observed in fetal or adult HR (Oney and Kaulhausen, 1982;
Sander-Jensen et al., 1988). ANGII converting enzyme, however,
is found in great quantity in the human SAN, perhaps indicating
local synthesis of ANGII (Beaulieu and Lambert, 1998). ANGII is
clearly a hormone that warrants further investigation regarding
its role in HR control in human, especially as receptor expression
and circulating ANGII concentration change substantially in
pathology (Mehta and Griendling, 2007).
Endothelin
Endothelin peptide hormones, ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3, are
produced in vascular endothelial cells, and act as vasoconstrictors
(Gordan et al., 2015). However, they have also been shown
to affect automaticity of the SAN. Experimental studies have
shown varying chronotropic effects following ET-1 application.
ET-1 application to guinea pig right atrial tissue increases
HR (Ishikawa et al., 1988), whereas decreased HR occurs in
rabbit SAN myocytes (Tanaka et al., 1997; Ono et al., 2001).
In anesthetized cats, ET-1 application results in increased HR
at low doses but a biphasic response at higher doses, whereas
ET-3 application only increases HR (Minkes et al., 1989). It
has been proposed that these differing responses are due to
differential activation of the two endothelin receptors A and
B (ETA and ETB). Both are expressed in the SAN, with ETA
causing a decrease and ETB causing an increase in HR (Ono
et al., 2001). ETA activation by ET-1 hyperpolarizes membrane
potential by activating IKACh, and inhibits ICaL by way of Gi
protein signaling (Ono et al., 2001). In pigs, intravenous infusion
of an ETA inhibitor causes an increase in HR, suggesting a
role for endogenous ET and basal activation of ETA receptors
in the maintenance of HR (Gelzer et al., 2004). The pathway
activated by ETB in the SAN that results in an increase in HR
requires further investigation. ETB activation in endothelial cells
causes NO production and activates the Gq protein cascade, so
perhaps a similar pathway is activated in the SAN (Horinouchi
et al., 2013). Minimal data exist regarding endothelin and
its receptors in the SAN of human. In one study, patients
with coronary artery disease were infused with the same ETA
inhibitor as in the pig study above, yet no change in HR was
observed (Kolettis et al., 2003). Although this could relate to
a species difference, it may also be a consequence of altered
levels of basal ET and other neurohumoral agents affecting
HR with coronary artery disease. It has also been shown that
ET-1 levels contribute to the reduced HR variability seen in
heart failure patients, perhaps by modulating SAN function
(Aronson et al., 2001).
Thyroid Hormones
Thyroid hormones are biogenic amines that are released from
the thyroid gland and can influence HR over a longer time
time scale than most agents (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008).
It is well documented in humans that high levels of thyroid
hormone in the circulation (hyperthyroidism) lead to increased
HR, whereas low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism)
are associated with decreased HR. Thyroid hormones act on
nuclear hormone receptors (thyroid receptors, TR) which are
a group of intracellular ligand-dependent transcription factors
of which there are two subtypes: TRα and TRβ (Mangoni
and Nargeot, 2008). Their activation can alter the expression
of different cardiac ion channels. In rabbit isolated SAN
myocytes, incubation with triiodothyronine (T3) to mimic
hyperthyroidism increases the amplitude of If without altering
the voltage-dependence of the current (Renaudon et al., 2000).
It has been shown in rats that T3 application significantly
increases the mRNA expression level of HCN2 (Pachucki
et al., 1999). Thus, it appears that an increase in If channel
expression with T3 stimulation increases the density of If
,
causing an increase in HR. In mouse lines meant to mimic
hypothyroidism (TRα and TRβ KO), TRβ KO mice demonstrated
no alterations in HCN expression level or HR, whereas the
TRα KO had decreased HR and a reduction in both HCN2
and HCN4 expression levels, implying that the effects of T3
on HCN channel expression occur through activation of TRα
(Gloss et al., 2001). Expression levels of both the Na+-Ca2+
exchanger and Na+/K+-ATPase have been shown to change
based on thyroid concentration in rats, which could also
affect HR (Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008). Thyroid hormones
can also indirectly modulate HR in rats by increasing the
number of β1-AR in the plasma membrane, increasing the
ability for NE or epinephrine to increase HR (Dillmann,
1989). Thyroid hormones have also been shown to change
HR in rats on a much shorter times scale, implicating a non￾genomic mechanism perhaps mediated by eNOS (Rutigliano
and Zucchi, 2017). Although there is no clear data describing
specific mechanisms for the chronotropic effect of thyroid
hormones seen in humans, it was shown that even when
within a normal range in healthy individuals, there is a
positive correlation between circulating T3 concentration and
resting HR (Roef et al., 2013). In a study to determine
the effect of thyroid hormones on the ANS control of HR,
basal HR was higher in people with hyperthyroidism, and
following complete ANS blockade, HR values remained higher
in people with hyperthyroidism, suggesting the tachycardia

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
with hyperthyroidism may at least in part be due to direct
effect of thyroid hormones on the SAN (Valcavi et al.,
1992). However, at least some component of the response is
likely via indirect action through the ANS, as blockade of
the sympathetic nerves alone reduces tachycardia in patients
with hyperthyroidism (Valcavi et al., 1992). This could be
due to the upregulation of β1-AR expression, as in rats.
Although the intracellular mechanisms(s) are unclear, there
is clearly a role for thyroid hormones in control of the
human SAN. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which
this happens is important for people with hyperthyroidism
not only because of the determinantal effects of chronic
tachycardia, but also because it increases the likelihood of atrial
fibrillation, atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, and sinus
node dysfunction (Valcavi et al., 1992).
Parathyroid Hormone
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is synthesized by the parathyroid
gland and modulates many organs and tissues via the circulation
in an endocrine fashion. PTH-related protein does not normally
circulate in the blood but is present in most cells. It is produced
in cardiomyocytes and acts locally as an autocrine or paracrine
hormone (Shimoni, 1999). There are two parathyroid receptors,
PTH1R and PTH2R, both of which increase intracellular
cAMP concentrations (Potthoff et al., 2011). PTH1R is coupled
to both the Gs and Gq protein pathways, thus increasing
intracellular cAMP, PKA, PLC, IP3, and PKC (Chorev, 2002).
PTH2R activation increases intracellular cAMP and activates
receptor internalization (Usdin et al., 2002). In rabbit SAN
myocytes, PTH increases AP firing frequency by increasing
the amplitude of If and in turn the slope of SDD (Hara
et al., 1997). PTH has also been shown to increase HR in
rat isolated hearts (Shimoyama et al., 2001). In a clinical
study involving chronic heart failure patients, there was a
positive correlation between endogenous PTH levels and HR,
suggesting a role for PTH in the associated increased HR
(Sugimoto et al., 2013). Similarly, in two studies of patients
undergoing kidney dialysis, increased endogenous PTH was
associated with a decrease in HR variability, implicating PTH
in the ANS dysfunction that occurs in individuals with kidney
failure (Ussawawongaraya et al., 2013; Poulikakos et al., 2014).
Although both PTH receptors are expressed in human atria
and thus PTH might increase HR by directly affecting SAN
myocytes as it does rabbit myocytes, it is also possible that
observed increases in HR in humans are due to indirect
effects on the SAN via the ANS (Potthoff et al., 2011).
Specifically, in human atrial tissue PTH causes release of NE
from sympathetic nerve terminals, which could account for
an increase in HR, although this effect has not yet been
demonstrated experimentally (Potthoff et al., 2011). Although
it seems apparent that PTH modulates HR, there are still some
areas for investigation, including understanding the role of PTH
in HR control in healthy humans compared to pathological
settings, the intracellular pathway(s) by which PTH affects
human SAN myocytes and/or sympathetic nerve terminals, and
the relative contribution of each mechanism to the chronotropic
response with PTH.
Bradykinin
Bradykinin is an inflammatory mediator peptide primarily
known for its role in regulating blood pressure (Golias et al.,
2007). Bradykinin receptors are GPCRs and have been reported
to exist in the heart (Golias et al., 2007). With co-expression of
one of these receptors (BK2R) and HCN1 or HCN2 in Xenopus
oocytes, a modulatory effect of bradykinin on HCN channel
dynamics has been demonstrated (Pian et al., 2007). BK2R is
coupled to a Gq/11 pathway that stimulates PLC activity, which
causes a depolarizing shift in the activation of HCN channels
(Pian et al., 2007). When bradykinin is applied to patch-clamped
rabbit SAN myocytes, a similar depolarizing shift in If activation
is observed (Pian et al., 2007), which would be expected to
increase HR. This is supported by a study in anesthetized rats,
in which intravenous bradykinin causes tachycardia (Ponchon
et al., 1995). In contrast, however, BK2R knock-out mice have
increased basal HR and bradykinin injections into the brainstem
of the mouse decreases HR, suggesting that BK2R activation may
in fact lower HR in mice (Madeddu et al., 1999). In patients
both with and without atherosclerosis, bradykinin increases HR
when injected into the left coronary artery, although no effect is
seen when injected into the right coronary artery (Schaefer et al.,
1996), which is a surprising result as the branch supplying blood
to the SAN most commonly arises from the right coronary artery
(Pejkovic et al., 2008). Clearly, our understanding of the role of
bradykinin on HR regulation and SAN modulation is lacking,
particularly in humans.
Relaxin
Relaxin is a reproductive hormone that is released during
the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy, with many known
effects on the reproductive (Bell et al., 1987) and cardiovascular
systems (Han et al., 1994a). Experimentally, relaxin has been
shown to increase HR in rat atria and rabbit SAN myocytes
(Kakouris et al., 1992; Han et al., 1994a). In rabbit SAN myocytes,
relaxin increases firing rate by enhancing ICaL in a cAMP/PKA
dependent manner (Han et al., 1994a). Relaxin binds to GPCRs
and increases intracellular cAMP, but the specific receptor
subtypes and cascades in the SAN are unknown. Administration
of relaxin has also been shown to have secondary therapeutic
effects via inhibition of cardiac mast cell activation, preventing
histamine release and subsequent tachyarrhythmias in the pig
(Nistri et al., 2008). No studies have been reported specifically
investigating the effects of relaxin on the SAN in humans, but
it may be relevant in the context of cardiovascular complications
that occur with pregnancy, as circulating relaxin levels are high
during the first trimester (Bell et al., 1987). During this period
there is also an increase in cardiac output (in preparation for
the increased cardiac demand imposed from the development
of the fetus) (Meah et al., 2016), so relaxin may play a role in
increasing cardiac output during pregnancy (as has been shown
in rats, through an increase in HR and contractility, Bell et al.,
1987). Interestingly, relaxin can cross the placenta during the
early stages of pregnancy, and circulating relaxin levels correlate
with fetal HR, suggesting it may play a role in controlling HR of
the developing fetus (Johnson et al., 1994). While it may be that

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
relaxin’s influence on the SAN is an important normal control
mechanism during pregnancy, in the absence of pregnancy it may
have unwarranted effects on HR.
Nitric Oxide
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas produced in almost all cell types
that has numerous cardiac effects (Massion et al., 2003).
Even within the SAN itself, NO has diverse, and sometimes
conflicting consequences, and is found as a component in many
signaling pathways. NO production occurs in cardiomyocytes
and in nearby endothelial cells, either by endothelial NO
synthase (eNOS) or by neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), and
in pathological situations NO can be produced by inducible
NO synthase (iNOS) (Fischmeister et al., 2005). NO binds to
soluble GC (sGC), which causes cGMP production, and therefore
an increase in intracellular cGMP concentrations (Fischmeister
et al., 2005). cGMP interacts with many targets to modulate
HR, including PKG and PDEs. NO-activated cGMP attenuates
ICaL in rat and guinea pig SAN myocytes by PKG-mediated
channel phosphorylation (Fischmeister et al., 2005). NO also has
conflicting downstream effects on ICaL, as cGMP activates PDE2
(which should decrease ICaL), but also inhibits PDE3 (which
should increase ICaL) (Fischmeister et al., 2005). Not all effects
of NO are due to cGMP, however. It has been shown that low
concentrations of NO can activate Gs proteins (which would be
expected to increase HR), and NO can activate Gi proteins (which
would be expected to decrease HR) (Fischmeister et al., 2005). It
has also been shown that NO can activate If
(Massion et al., 2003).
An additional complicating factor is that NO modulates release of
neurotransmitters from autonomic neurons. NO can inhibit the
presynaptic release of NE from sympathetic neurons and facilitate
the release of ACh from vagal neurons (Paterson, 2001).
Ultimately, it would seem that the multitude of ways in which
NO can influence SAN automaticity makes it difficult to discern
its net effect on HR (Chowdhary and Townend, 1999). Yet a
series of human studies may have helped provide insight into
its role in modulating HR (Chowdhary et al., 2000, 2002a,b,
2004). In healthy individuals, intravenous administration of a
NOS inhibitor, as well as a control agent, caused an increase in
blood pressure and a subsequent baroreflex-mediated decrease
in HR; however, NOS caused less bradycardia than the control
agent (Chowdhary et al., 2000). This indicates that inhibition
of NOS removes the tonic excitatory effect of NO on vagal
activity. Further, administration of exogenous NO and a control
agent caused decreased blood pressure and a subsequent
baroreflex-mediated increase in HR, yet the exogenous NO
caused less tachycardia than the control agent, demonstrating the
preservation of vagal control (Chowdhary et al., 2000). Although
NO may also directly act on SAN myocytes, these experiments
suggest that any such effects are overwhelmed by the effect of
NO on the ANS. This was demonstrated in a study in human
heart transplant recipients, whose hearts are disconnected from
the ANS. In these patients, exogenous NO increased HR and
NOS inhibition decreased HR, changes that were not a reflex
response, as the control agents increased blood pressure but
did not change HR (Chowdhary et al., 2002a). During heart
failure, baroreflex-mediated parasympathetic activation is still
dependent on NO synthesis (Chowdhary et al., 2002b), and
stimulation of the endogenous NO pathway may be a strategy for
increasing parasympathetic activity under conditions of adverse
sympathetic overactivity, such as with ventricular arrhythmias
(Chowdhary et al., 2004).
INTEGRATED CONTROL OF
NEUROHUMORAL SIGNALING
As there are a multitude of different neurohumoral factors
that influence SAN activity, but share common intracellular
signaling pathways, understanding their integration is important
for understanding the combined effect on the SAN and HR.
Intracellular Compartmentalization
Intracellular compartmentalization of the various complex
signaling cascades in the SAN is essential for its proper function
(Steinberg and Brunton, 2001). Not only are compartments
physically formed in the membrane, such as caveolae and
lipid rafts, compartmentalization also occurs by intracellular
biochemical modulators. PDEs degrade cAMP and/or cGMP
and the variety and abundance of PDEs helps modulate the
cellular responses by controlling the duration and amplitude of
cAMP/cGMP responses, both at basal levels and in response to
neurohumoral stimulation (Zaccolo and Movsesian, 2007), as
well as creating spatially and temporally distinct pools of cAMP
and cGMP by forming functional diffusion barriers (Steinberg
and Brunton, 2001; Yaniv et al., 2015). There are 8 different PDE
families that have been identified in the heart: PDE1, PDE2, and
PDE3 hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP; PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8
are cAMP-specific enzymes; and PDE5 and PDE9 are cGMP￾specific (Zaccolo and Movsesian, 2007). Not only do each of these
PDE families have differential ability to enzymatically degrade
cAMP and/or cGMP, they also have distinct effects in different
cardiac cell types (Hua et al., 2012). In mouse isolated SAN
myocytes, PDEs regulate basal firing rate, which is increased
with global or selective PDE inhibition (PDE2, PDE3, or PDE4)
(Hua et al., 2012). In addition, when PDE2 in mouse or human
SAN myocytes, or PDE3 or PDE4 in mouse SAN myocytes
is inhibited, ICaL is activated at more negative membrane
potentials and its current amplitude increases, accounting for
the increase in firing rate (Rivet-Bastide et al., 1997; Hua et al.,
2012). PDE3 also regulates IKs in guinea pig SAN myocytes via
hydrolysis of cGMP, as its inhibition increases current amplitude
(Shimizu et al., 2002).
Basal PDE degradation of cAMP in rabbit SAN myocytes
has been shown to modulate and compartmentalize Ca2+-clock
mechanisms such as RyR and PLB, as PDE inhibition increases
the rate and amplitude of local Ca2+ releases (Vinogradova
et al., 2008). This has been confirmed specifically for PDE1A
in rabbit SAN myocytes, facilitated by its higher expression in
the SAN compared to other regions of the heart (Lukyanenko
et al., 2016). Although inhibition of single PDEs only moderately
increases SAN myocyte firing, recently it has been shown
that dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition synergistically increases
basal SAN firing rate by ∼50% (Vinogradova et al., 2018a).

fphys-11-00170 February 28, 2020 Time: 20:29 # 18
MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
Concurrent PDE3 and PDE4 activation modulates Ca2+-clock
components, specifically via a decrease in cAMP and PKA
phosphorylation, which suppresses local Ca2+ releases and
decreases HR (Vinogradova et al., 2018b). Following blockade
of RyR with ryanodine, dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition failed
to increase spontaneous HR, implicating that modulation of the
Ca2+-clock is necessary for basal synergistic effects of PDE3 and
PDE4 on HR (Vinogradova et al., 2018b).
Not only do PDEs attenuate basal SAN firing, they also
modulate the response to neurohumoral stimulation. Because so
many of the neurohumoral pathways in the SAN activate AC
and GC, without intracellular control these secondary messenger
systems would be limited in their ability to specifically target a
response (Fischmeister et al., 2006). In mouse SAN myocytes
it has been shown that compartmentalization of HCN channels
by PDEs may play an important role in regulating β1-AR
modulation of If
(St. Clair et al., 2017). Specifically, it appears that
PDE4 acts as a barrier that isolates HCN channels from the rest
of the cell, so that under basal conditions they cannot be accessed
by cAMP, and that PDE3 interacts with PKA to favor the β1-
AR/cAMP/PKA/HCN pathway (rather than activation by direct
binding of cAMP to HCN) (St. Clair et al., 2017).
Another important consideration in the SAN’s complex
signaling network is crosstalk between cAMP and cGMP.
Negative feedback pathways exist for both cAMP and cGMP, such
that when they activate PKA or PKG, these kinases activate PDEs
that then degrade cAMP or cGMP. Specifically, cAMP-dependent
PKA stimulates PDE3 and PDE4, which degrades cAMP, while
cGMP-stimulated PKG activates PDE5, thus inhibiting cGMP.
These signals are also interconnected, as cGMP can activate
or inactivate PDEs that degrade cAMP. Specifically, cGMP
activates PDE2 (decreasing levels of cAMP) and inactivates
PDE3 (increasing cAMP). More cGMP is required to activate
PDE2 than to inhibit PDE3, thus the latter occurs more readily
and at lower cGMP concentrations. Conversely, cAMP can
inhibit cGMP production through PKA-activated PDE5. An
important aspect of the above responses is that the particular
PDE activated or inhibited by cGMP or cAMP partly depends
on their concentration. This interplay and its importance during
neurohumoral stimulation has been demonstrated in mouse
SAN tissue, as following a β-AR-induced increase in firing rate,
application of a PDE5 inhibitor decreases frequency, a response
that is attenuated by PDE2 inhibition (Isidori et al., 2015). This
suggests that by preventing degradation of cGMP by PDE5,
more PDE2 is activated by cGMP, which then degrades cAMP
and decreases HR.
Neurohumoral signaling pathways are not only controlled by
PDE hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP, but also by tethering of PKA
to specific intracellular locations by A-kinase-anchoring proteins
(AKAP) (Zaccolo and Movsesian, 2007). Sequestering of PKA
into localized pools by anchoring proteins allows for targeted
substrate phosphorylation. AKAP not only spatially restricts and
controls PKA but can also temporally modulate the actions
of PKA (Dodge-Kafka et al., 2006). Although the intracellular
distribution and dynamics of cGMP are not as well understood
as cAMP, it is likely that proteins analogous to AKAP localize
the actions of PKG to specific regions (Dodge-Kafka et al., 2006).
It has been shown that PKG directly anchors to NPR-A, and
this compartmentalization of cGMP helps modulate responses
elicited by activation from NP versus NO (Airhart et al., 2003).
Specific control of PKA and PKG by anchoring proteins in the
SAN, however, requires further investigation.
Receptor Regulation
Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) catalyze the hydrolysis
of Gα-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to Gα-guanosine
diphosphate (GDP), effectively inactivating the GPCR (Riddle
et al., 2005). GTP to GDP hydrolysis is a rate-limiting step for
signal termination, so the longer the Gα subunit is in its active
form (Gα-GTP) the longer a signal is activated in a cell (Mighiu
and Heximer, 2012). RGS proteins inhibit G-protein signaling
cascades by speeding up this intrinsically slow GTP hydrolysis.
Limited studies have been performed examining RGS proteins
in the SAN, but it is clear that they are important for
controlling the downstream effects of M2R activation in mouse
SAN myocytes (Cifelli et al., 2008; Mighiu and Heximer, 2012;
Stewart et al., 2012; Wydeven et al., 2014). RGS4 and RGS6
have been shown to be more abundantly expressed in the
SAN than other cardiac tissues (Mighiu and Heximer, 2012;
Wydeven et al., 2014). These endogenous RGS proteins oppose
the decrease in HR following parasympathetic stimulation
by accelerating GTPase activity to more rapidly terminate G
protein signaling, thus impeding activation of hyperpolarizing
GIRK channels (Berman et al., 1996). In cultured rabbit SAN
cells, RGS2 overexpression has been shown to increase the
phosphorylation of PLB along with HR, likely due to suppression
of the Gi signaling cascade (Yang et al., 2012). Other RGS
proteins are expressed in the heart, with important roles in
controlling neurohumoral activation, but they have not been
demonstrated specifically in SAN tissue or cells. For instance,
in ventricular myocytes RGS2 proteins have been shown to be
inhibitory downstream of catecholamines and ANGII activation
by hydrolysis of β2-AR activated Gαi subunits, as well as α1-AR
or AT activated Gαq subunits (Chakir et al., 2011).
G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRK) contribute to
β-AR desensitization. Seven characterized mammalian GRKs
have been shown to be expressed in the heart, with GRK2
expression most prominent (Huang et al., 2014). When GPCRs
are activated, GRK2 trans-locates from the cytosol to the plasma
membrane by binding with the Gβγ subunit and phosphorylating
the agonist-bound GPCR (Fu and Xiang, 2015). Following
phosphorylation by GRK, the GPCR becomes a target for
β-arrestin, which binds to the GRK-phosphorylated GPCR and
physically inhibits its signaling cascade by sterically hindering
interactions between the GPCR and the downstream G-proteins
(a process called homologous desensitization) (Huang et al.,
2014). Conversely, heterologous desensitization is initiated by
PKA or PKC phosphorylation of the GPCR (Huang et al.,
2014). GPCR phosphorylation increases the affinity of GPCR
for adaptor proteins, which initiates clathrin-pit formation,
which results in GPCR internalization (Fu and Xiang, 2015).
Once internalized, the GPCR is then sorted to either recycling
endosomes, to be trafficked back to the membrane, or to
lysosomes for degradation (Fu and Xiang, 2015).

MacDonald et al. Neurohormonal Control of Sinoatrial Node
CONCLUSION
One could argue that the SAN is one of the most important tissues
in the body, as it initiates each-and-every normal heartbeat.
Because the SAN is so critical to life, it is not surprising that it is
heavily controlled, ensuring that the heart can adapt and respond
to meet physiological demands. There are numerous overlapping
and redundant mechanisms that drive automaticity in the SAN,
to ensure that it continues to fire under widely varying conditions.
The combination of these pacemaking mechanisms and their
control by a multitude of neurohumoral factors creates an
intricate and complex system (Li et al., 2017).
Despite a solid foundation, our current understanding of
the complexities of the neurohumoral control of SAN activity
is lacking. Further characterization of the distribution and
expression of the many receptor types in SAN myocytes may help
provide insight into the comparative contribution of the different
neurohumoral agents. Often, the missing link in our current
understanding of how a specific neurohumoral agent modulates
HR lies between receptor activation and its intracellular
target; i.e., we know what receptor an agonist activates and
what pacemaker mechanisms it ultimately modulates, but
the pathways involved are not clear. Also, in many cases
investigations focus on effects on If and/or ICaL and do not
consider impacts on other important membrane currents such
as IKr or IKs, or on Ca2+-clock mechanisms, leaving us with
an incomplete understanding of subcellular mechanisms driving
observed HR responses.
There are many discrepancies in the literature regarding the
effects of specific neurohumoral factors on HR. This may relate
to species differences or differences in experimental approaches
or preparations. At the level of the whole SAN, however, there
may also be an important contribution of cellular heterogeneity.
While we have focused on the intracellular modulation of
SAN activity, it is important to appreciate that the SAN is
structurally and electrophysiologically heterogeneous (Mangoni
and Nargeot, 2008), so effects will vary across it. The SAN is
heavily innervated, with a complex network of nerve fibers and
ganglia whose density is much higher than the surrounding
myocardium (Roberts et al., 1989; Chow et al., 2001; Newton
et al., 2014; Pauza et al., 2014; Stoyek et al., 2015; Inokaitis et al.,
2016). Yet the SAN is not ubiquitously innervated and this, along
with variable receptor densities throughout the node, make it
functionally heterogeneous (MacKaay et al., 1980; Opthof, 2007).
Sympathetic control will dominate in heavily innervated regions
and areas with high receptor density, whereas these regions may
be silenced by parasympathetic control, such that areas with
fewer receptors or little innervation would then determine rate.
Moreover, neurohumoral stimulation can shift the location of the
leading pacemaker site in the SAN, which itself can result in a
change in HR, as different SAN myocytes have different intrinsic
cycle lengths (Opthof et al., 1987).
Overall, it is clear that further work is needed for a complete,
comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms
involved in neurohumoral control of SAN function. This will
be driven by technological advances in experimental techniques
(Kohl and Quinn, 2014), such as higher resolution imaging
and cell-specific optogenetics (Quinn et al., 2016), and may
be further enhanced by the use of alternative experimental
models (Stoyek et al., 2016, 2018; Stoyek and Quinn, 2018)
or computational modeling (Quinn and Kohl, 2011, 2013).
Ultimately, by improving our knowledge of SAN control we
will move toward a better understanding of how it responds to
constantly changing physiological demands, and how we may
better treat SAN dysregulation that leads to debilitating and often
deadly cardiac diseases.
