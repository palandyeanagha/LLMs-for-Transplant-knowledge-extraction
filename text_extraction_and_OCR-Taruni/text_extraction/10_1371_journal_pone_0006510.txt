Abstract
Background: Characteristic symptoms of malaria include recurrent fever attacks and neurodegeneration, signs that are also
found in patients with a hyperactive Nalp3 inflammasome. Plasmodium species produce a crystal called hemozoin that is
generated by detoxification of heme after hemoglobin degradation in infected red blood cells. Thus, we hypothesized that
hemozoin could activate the Nalp3 inflammasome, due to its particulate nature reminiscent of other inflammasome￾activating agents.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We found that hemozoin acts as a proinflammatory danger signal that activates the
Nalp3 inflammasome, causing the release of IL-1b. Similar to other Nalp3-activating particles, hemozoin activity is blocked
by inhibiting phagocytosis, K+ efflux and NADPH oxidase. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of hemozoin results in acute
peritonitis, which is impaired in Nalp3-, caspase-1- and IL-1R-deficient mice. Likewise, the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria is
dampened in Nalp3-deficient mice infected with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, while parasitemia remains unchanged.
Significance/Conclusions: The potent pro-inflammatory effect of hemozoin through inflammasome activation may possibly
be implicated in plasmodium-associated pathologies such as cerebral malaria.

Introduction
Malaria infects 300–500 million and kills more than one million
children annually. The causative agents of malaria, Plasmodium
species, go through a complex life cycle, involving both a mosquito
vector and the human host [1]. In infected individuals the parasite
first enters the clinically silent ‘‘liver stage’’ followed by a ‘‘blood
stage’’, which is characterized by cyclic red blood cell lysis resulting
in fever peaks, chills and anemia [2]. In less than 1–2% of cases,
severe malaria can evolve to its most lethal form, cerebral malaria
(CM). Plasmodium infection elicits in its host an immune response
that is characterized mostly by IFNc producing T cells and
antibodies directed against infected red blood cells [3,4]. However,
the immune response is also critically involved in the pathogenesis of
severe malaria, largely through the overproduction of pro￾inflammatory cytokines [5]. Concerning innate immunity, several
conserved molecular structures of Plasmodium have been proposed to
act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and are
activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic
cells (DCs), such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), which is a
TLR2 ligand [6].
Hemozoin is a heme crystal, which is formed by the parasite in
order to detoxify free heme resulting from hemoglobin digestion in
the infected red blood cells [7,8]. Plasmodium spp are able to form
insoluble hemozoin crystals in order to protect themselves from
oxidative damage resulting from the presence of free heme.
During red blood cell lysis, hemozoin is released into the blood
stream together with the parasite and cellular debris. Purified
hemozoin from P. falciparum, as well as synthetic hemozoin, can
activate macrophages and DCs to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines [9,10]. However, there are conflicting
reports on the immunomodulatory capacities of hemozoin crystals
per se. Hemozoin was reported to activate TLR9 signalling, and
according to that TLR9- and MyD88-deficient mice were shown
to be less susceptible to CM [10,11]. Yet these results were recently
questioned [12], as signalling triggered by P. falciparum-derived
hemozoin was shown to be dependent on the presence of malarial
DNA complexed to hemozoin, hence explaining the reported
implication of TLR9 [13].
The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 are produced
by cleavage of the inactive proIL-1b and proIL-18 precursors by
caspase-1. Caspase-1 is activated within a large multi-protein

complex, termed the inflammasome [14], which is triggered by
several danger-, stress- and/or infection-associated signals leading
to caspase-1 cleavage and activation. The Nalp3 inflammasome,
composed of the NLR protein Nalp3, the adaptor ASC and
caspase-1, has been shown to be implicated in the production of
mature IL-1b. It is now generally accepted that activation and
release of IL-1b requires two distinct signals: the first signal leads
to the transcriptional upregulation and synthesis of proIL-1b and
other components necessary for inflammasome function, such as
Nalp3 itself; the second signal leads to Nalp3 inflammasome
complex formation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1b cleavage. This
signal is constituted of an ever growing number of different stimuli
such as bacterial and viral PAMPs [15], stress-associated danger
signals such as ATP or MSU, and other particulate stimuli such as
asbestos, silica, alum and b-amyloid [16], while the actual
mechanism by which Nalp3 activation leads to caspase-1 cleavage
remains unknown. In this study we investigated whether hemozoin
could act as a Nalp3 inflammasome activating danger signal
leading to IL-1b production.
Results
Hemozoin induces IL-1b secretion in myeloid cells
In an attempt to determine more precisely the immunostimu￾latory capacities of hemozoin crystals, we produced synthetic
hemozoin (also called b-hematin), which is free of malarial DNA.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with
hemozoin produced relatively low levels of TNFa, IL-6 and MIP￾1a after 6 hours stimulation, as compared to stimulation with
TLR9-activating CpG (Figure 1a). On the other hand, BMDMs
stimulated with hemozoin were able to robustly secrete IL-1b and
IL-18 when primed with LPS (Figure 1b and Figure S1a). In
order to rule out any species- or cell type-specific effects, we tested
the ability of hemozoin to induce IL-1b production in the human
Figure 1. Hemozoin activates IL-1b secretion in murine and human macrophages and dendritic cells. (a,b) Bone marrow derived
macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated for 6 h with 150 mg/ml hemozoin and 2.5 mg/ml CpG. Cytokines and chemokines were measured by CBA. (c)
THP1 cells were stimulated for 1, 3 or 6 h with hemozoin, MSU or Nigericin and analysed by western blot. (d) Bone marrow derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs) were stimulated for 6 h with hemozoin, MSU, Nigericin or CpG. Cell extracts and supernatants were analysed by western blot. Data shown
are representative of three independent experiments.

macrophage-like cell line THP1 (Figure 1c), as well as in murine
bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Figure 1d). IL￾1b secretion was observed in both cell types in a time- and dose￾dependent manner (Figure 1c and Figure S1b).
Hemozoin-induced IL-1b secretion is Nalp3
inflammasome-dependent
The Nalp3 inflammasome is implicated in the production of
mature IL-1b and IL-18 in response to different signals among
which there are several particulate stimuli, such as MSU, alum or
asbestos [16]. The precise mechanism of Nalp3 inflammasome
activation is still poorly understood. We found that hemozoin￾induced IL-1b secretion was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD, where cleaved caspase-1 was no longer observed
(Figure 2a) and no IL-1b secretion could be observed in
caspase-1-deficient macrophages stimulated with hemozoin or any
inflammasome activator tested (Figure S1d). In addition to
caspase-1, the inflammasome components ASC and Nalp3 were
required for IL-1b production in response to hemozoin
(Figure 2a, 2b and Figure S1c). In contrast, Ipaf, another
NLR protein shown to form an inflammasome responsible of IL￾1b production in response to bacteria such as Salmonella [17], was
not essential for hemozoin-induced IL-1b secretion (Figure 2b).
In unprimed cells hemozoin was still able to induce caspase-1
cleavage although to a lesser extent, clearly showing its potent
inflammasome-activating capacities (Figure 2c). Hemozoin￾induced IL-1b production was not mediated by ATP released
from dying cells as a consequence of hemozoin toxicity, as shown
by the use of P2X7-deficient BMDMs (Figure 3a). Likewise, uric
acid crystals, that can act as an endogenous danger signal
produced upon cellular stress, are not involved in hemozoin￾mediated signal transmission, as inflammasome activation was not
altered in the presence of uricase (Figure 3b). In agreement with
previous results, we found that heme, the precursor of hemozoin,
does not activate caspase-1 but is toxic, as seen by PARP cleavage
(Figure 3c). Importantly, hemozoin treatment did not result in
PARP cleavage, indicating that the hemozoin preparation used is
not toxic and free of contaminating heme. In order to exclude any

implication of DNA-mediated TLR9 signalling in IL-1b produc￾tion by hemozoin as proposed [13], we used MyD88-deficient
macrophages where caspase-1 cleavage was still observed,
although there was no IL-1b secreted as expected (Figure 4a).
In addition, treatment of hemozoin with DNaseI had no effect on
IL-1b production (Figure 4b). Chloroquine is a well-known
antimalarial drug, but its exact mechanism of action in malaria
treatment is still unknown. It has been shown that chloroquine can
interfere with the hemozoin crystallization process in infected red
blood cells [18]. Chloroquine is also known to block endosomal
acidification, resulting in improper TLR9 signalling [19].
Treatment with chloroquine prior to BMDM stimulation with
hemozoin had no effect on IL-1b production by hemozoin, MSU
or nigericin at any of the different chloroquine concentrations
tested (Figure 4c and Figure S2). Nevertheless, chloroquine
inhibited CpG-dependent IL-6 production, whereas hemozoin￾induced IL-6 and MIP-1a production was independent of TLR9
(Figure 4c and data not shown). We also tested the effect of
bafilomycin A1 on inflammasome activation in response to
hemozoin. Bafilomycin blocks the vacuolar H+ ATPase system
necessary for lysosomal acidification and has been shown to inhibit
inflammasome activation in response to silica [20]. We could not
observe this effect on inflammasome activation by hemozoin,
MSU or nigericin both in BMDMs and in THP1 cells
(Figure 4d,e). However, bafilomycin could strongly reduce
proIL1b induction in response to stimulation with CpG
(Figure 4d).
Phagocytosis of hemozoin crystals is necessary for Nalp3
inflammasome activation as shown by the ability of cytochalasin
D to suppress IL-1b production (Figure 5a). Similar to Nalp3
inflammasome activation by other particulate stimuli such as MSU
or asbestos, hemozoin-induced IL-1b production was inhibited by
blocking the K+ efflux from the cell by using the ATP-sensitive
potassium channel inhibitor glybenclamide (Figure 2a,b and
Figure 5b). Also, generation of ROS is implicated in hemozoin￾induced IL-1b production, as demonstrated by experiments using
the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI or cells with p22phox levels that
are reduced by RNAi (Figure 5c,d). The exact source of ROS is
still unclear, since the gp91phox (NOX2) subunit of the complex
does not seem to be required for inflammasome activation
(Figure 5e and [20] ). This observation suggests the implication
of one of the several other NOX isoforms in this process. An
additional mechanism of inflammasome activation based on lyso￾somal destabilisation and release of cathepsin B in response to crys￾tal phagocytosis was recently proposed [20]. We took advantage of
cathepsin B-deficient BMDMs to test this hypothesis, however no
differences in IL-1b secretion and caspase-1 cleavage in response to
several inflammasome activators, such as hemozoin, MSU or alum
were observed (Figure 5f). Similar results were observed in bone￾marrow derived dendritic cells (data not shown).

in BMDMs as compared to hemozoin (150 mg/ml) or MSU (150 mg/ml), but leads to PARP cleavage, indicating its toxicity. Cell supernatants and

Hemozoin has pro-inflammatory properties in vivo
In order to determine the pro-inflammatory and danger signal
capacities of hemozoin in vivo, we used a well-established peritonitis
model where intraperitoneal injection of inflammasome activators
results in neutrophil influx to the peritoneal cavity [20,21].
Hemozoin elicited a considerable increase in the recruitment of

activation. (a) Crystal phagocytosis is essential for hemozoin induced IL-1b production as evidenced by the use of cytochalasin D (2 mM) to block

Hemozoin induced IL-1b production can be reduced by the use of ROS inhibitors, such as APDC (50 mM) and DPI (20 mM). (d) NADPH oxidase subunit

neutrophils 6 h after injection compared to PBS in both mice on a
C57BL/6 background (Nalp3+/+
) and on a BALB/c background
(IL-1R+/+
) (Figure 6). When hemozoin was injected in mice
deficient in IL-1R, neutrophil influx was markedly impaired,
implicating a role for IL-1 signalling in attracting neutrophils to
the peritoneal cavity (Figure 6a). In keeping with this, the IL-1
antagonist, IL-1Ra (Anakinra) also efficiently blocked neutrophil
recruitment (Figure 6b). Importantly, reduced neutrophil influx
was also observed in caspase-1-deficient mice and Nalp3-deficient
mice (Figure 6c and d), as well as in ASC-deficient mice
(Figure S3a). In contrast, zymosan-induced neutrophil influx was
not affected by IL-1R- or Nalp3-deficiency, indicating that Nalp3-
deficient mice do not have a general defect in neutrophil
recruitment (Figure 6e and f). The reduction in neutrophil
recruitment was strongest in IL-1R-deficient and Anakinra-treated
mice, suggesting that IL-1a or other signalling pathways
participate in hemozoin-induced neutrophil recruitment. Chloro￾quine treatment had no significant effect, suggesting that TLR9 is
not involved in attracting neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity in
response to hemozoin (Figure S3b).
Nalp3 is implicated in the development of cerebral
malaria
Based on the observed inflammasome-activating capacity of
hemozoin in vitro, we investigated the potential role for the
inflammasome in malaria. To this end we used Plasmodium berghei
ANKA (PbA) infection in mice as a model for cerebral malaria
(CM) [22]. Mice were injected intravenously with a low number of
PbA sporozoites, which first migrate to the liver where they evolve
to form merozoites that are released during the clinically silent
liver stage. The merozoites eventually invade erythrocytes leading
to their cyclic rupture and re-infection. Mice on a C57Bl/6

injected intraperitoneally with 0.25 mg of hemozoin, 0.2 mg of zymosan or PBS as a control. Neutrophil influx (CD11b+ Ly-6C+ Ly-6Ghigh F4/802) was
quantified 6 h later by FACS (values are mean6s.e.m and n = 4–6 mice per group). Differences between groups were calculated using the unpaired t
test and were considered significant (*) when p#0.05. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

background are susceptible for developing the neurological signs of
CM and usually die 7–12 days post infection. When wild type
(Nalp3+/+
) and Nalp3-deficient mice were infected with 10 PbA
sporozoites, a consistent proportion of Nalp3+/+ control mice died
from CM after 7–12 days, whereas the Nalp3-deficient mice
resisted better to CM development (Figure 7a). Mice from both
groups were similarly infected with PbA, as parasitemia,
corresponding to the percentage of infected red blood cells
(iRBC), could be monitored for all the mice (Figure 7b).
Increasing parasitemia was observed in both the Nalp3+/+ and the
Nalp3-deficient mice that resisted CM, and mice were killed three
weeks after infection when their iRBC number exceeded 80% and
the mice developed hyperparasitemia-induced anaemia, a condi￾tion unrelated to CM. Overall, 73% of Nalp32/2 mice were
resistant to CM, as compared to only 44% of Nalp3+/+ mice
(Figure 7c). We examined immunopathological changes in the
brains of Nalp3+/+ and Nalp32/2 mice 9 days after infection.
Nalp3+/+ mice showed typical vascular occlusion with parasitized
erythrocytes as well as lymphomonocytic infiltrates and microvas￾cular destruction including pathological endothelial cells
(Figure 7d (i)). In contrast, very limited characteristic patholog￾ical changes were detected in Nalp3-deficient mice, such as
moderate leukocyte infiltration and damaged endothelial cells,
suggesting that Nalp3-dependent immune responses may play a
role in the brain pathogenesis of CM (Figure 7d (ii)). CD45
staining also shows infiltration of leukocytes in the brains of
Plasmodium infected Nalp3+/+ mice, whereas Nalp32/2 mice show
reduced CD45 staining (Figure 7d (iii and iv)).

Discussion
A better comprehension of the molecular mechanisms leading to
malaria is instrumental for the development of novel and more
efficient anti-malarial drugs. It is generally accepted that in addition to
parasite-associated virulence factors, an exacerbated host inflamma￾tory response to parasite infection resulting in collateral damage,
contributes to cerebral malaria [4]. TLRs are thought to play a central
role in this response, since they are not only able to detect parasite￾specific molecular patterns, but also host-derived hemozoin in a
complex with plasmodial DNA [10,13]. Here we show that in
addition to TLRs, hemozoin activates the Nalp3 inflammasome, thus
possibly explaining its potent proinflammatory activity.
A plethora of Nalp3 inflammasome-activating substances have
been identified. A minority of them are PAMPs of bacterial or
viral origin, while most of them are host-derived substances or
particles released into the environment (DAMPs). The most active
known endogenous danger signals are ATP and MSU. Hemozoin
appears to match the level of potency of these two activators.
Unlike ATP that activates the Nalp3 inflammasome through
P2X7 receptor-mediated K+ efflux, hemozoin requires crystal
formation (the precursor heme is inactive) in the same way as
MSU, where soluble uric acid does not activate the inflamma￾some. It is therefore not surprising that hemozoin and MSU use
similar signalling pathways, including crystal phagocytosis, gener￾ation of ROS and K+ efflux.
The exact role which hemozoin plays in malaria pathogenesis is
still a matter of debate. Although hemozoin was initially proposed
to possess a direct neurotoxic role through activation of TLRs,
murine cerebral malaria was recently shown to develop in the
absence of TLR signalling [11,12]. The obvious differences in
these studies are not easily explained, as the experimental settings
used are almost identical. Our results suggest that the Nalp3
inflammasome may also contribute to the effects of malaria and
possibly also to the neurotoxicity. If future studies can confirm this
notion, drugs that dampen hemozoin-triggered inflammasome
activation may thus efficaciously complement conventional
antimalarial drugs.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Nalp32/2[21], Asc2/2 and Ipaf2/2[23], caspase-12/2[24],
MyD882/2[25], gp91phox2/2 (Jackson Laboratories, stock#002365)
and P2X72/2 (Jackson Laboratories, stock#005576) mice (on
C57BL/6J background) and IL-1R2/2[26] (on BALB/c background)
were housed at the University of Lausanne following the Swiss Federal
Veterinary Office guidelines. Six to ten week old C57Bl/6J-OlaHsd
and BALB/c-OlaHsd mice were purchased from Harlan, The
Netherlands.
Reagents
Hemozoin was prepared as described [9]. Briefly, hemin
chloride (from Sigma BioChemika, . 98% HPLC) was dissolved
in degassed NaOH, the pH adjusted to 4.8 by addition of
propionic acid and the solution left O/N at 70uC. The formed
crystals were extensively washed in NaHCO3 several times,
alternated with water rinses. Finally the crystals were washed
with H2O and methanol alternatively, before being dried over
phosphorus pentoxide. The crystals were then weighed and
dissolved at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in PBS.
Nigericin, uric acid, cytochalasin D and z-VAD-fmk were
purchased from Sigma and DPI from Alexis. Ultrapure LPS was
obtained from Invivogen. Anti-human cleaved IL-1b (2021L) was
purchased from Cell Signaling, and anti-IL1b p35 is a sheep
antibody made in the Tschopp laboratory. The antibody against
mouse IL-1b was a gift from Roberto Solari, Glaxo. The antibody
against mouse caspase-1 (p20) was a generous gift from Dr. Peter
Vandenabeele (Ghent University). Cytokine and chemokine
detection was performed with the Cytometric Beads Array
(CBA) kits from BD Biosciences. All tissue culture reagents were
bought from Invitrogen.
Generation of THP1 cells expressing shRNA
THP-1 stably expressing shNALP3, caspase-1, ASC and
p22phox were obtained as previously described [27].
Cell preparation
Bone-marrow macrophages were derived form tibia and
femoral bone marrow cells as described elsewhere [28]. Mouse
macrophages were primed overnight with 250 ng/ml ultra-pure
LPS (Invivogen) and cell culture medium was removed before
stimulation for 6 h in Optimem.
For experiments, THP-1 were differentiated 3 hours with
0.5 mM PMA. Cell extracts and precipitated supernatants were
analyzed by western blot and CBA.
In vivo mouse peritonitis model
Peritonitis was induced by injection of 0.25 mg of hemozoin or
0.2 mg zymosan in 0.5 ml sterile PBS. After 6 h, mice were killed by
CO2 exposure and peritoneal cavities were washed with 6 ml of
PBS. The lavage fluids were analysed for neutrophil influx by
FACS (CD11b+ Ly-6C+ Ly-6Ghigh F4/802). The following
monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-F4/
80 (BM8) from ebioscience, anti-Ly-6C (AL-21) and anti-Ly-6G
(1A8) from BD Biosciences. Samples were acquired on a
FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by using the FLOWJO
software (Tree Star).
Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection
The P. berghei (ANKA strain) was maintained by alternating
cyclic passage of the parasite in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes and in
BALB/c mice at the mosquito colony of the Department of
Biochemistry, University of Lausanne. Sporozoites were collected
by dissecting the mosquito salivary glands in DMEM 21 days after
their infective blood meal. Each mouse was infected with 10 viable
sporozoites by IV injection in the tail vein. After 5 days, infection
of red blood cells (RBC) was monitored by microscopy of Giemsa￾stained thin blood smears and used to calculate parasitemia (as %
of infected RBC). 6–10 days after infection, susceptible mice
started to develop symptoms of cerebral malaria (CM). Survival
and signs of disease were monitored daily. Animals that showed
neurological signs, such as convulsions, ataxia and paralysis, and
died between 7 and 12 days after infection were considered to
have CM. Brains were removed and used for histological analysis.
Cerebral histopathology
Brains were fixed in buffered formol for 12 hours and paraffin￾embedded. Cerebral tissue sections (2 mm) were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or Prussian blue using standard
procedures. CD45 staining was performed after antigen retrieval
with a TRIS/EDTA pH 9 solution. CD45/Ly5 antibody was
from BD Pharmingen (#550539).
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were calculated using the unpaired t
test (GraphPad Prism version 5.0). Differences were considered
significant when p#0.05.
