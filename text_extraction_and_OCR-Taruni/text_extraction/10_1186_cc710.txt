Abstract
According to the Frank–Starling relationship, a patient is a ‘responder’ to volume expansion
only if both ventricles are preload dependent. Mechanical ventilation induces cyclic changes
in left ventricular (LV) stroke volume, which are mainly related to the expiratory decrease in
LV preload due to the inspiratory decrease in right ventricular (RV) filling and ejection. In the
present review, we detail the mechanisms by which mechanical ventilation should result in
greater cyclic changes in LV stroke volume when both ventricles are ‘preload dependent’.
We also address recent clinical data demonstrating that respiratory changes in arterial pulse
(or systolic) pressure and in Doppler aortic velocity (as surrogates of respiratory changes in
LV stroke volume) can be used to detect biventricular preload dependence, and hence fluid
responsiveness in critically ill patients.

Introduction
Volume expansion is a frequently used therapy in critically
ill patients with acute circulatory failure. The expected
haemodynamic benefit of volume expansion is an increase
in LV stroke volume, and hence in cardiac output. The rela￾tionship described by Frank and Starling between preload
and stroke volume is not linear, but rather is curvilinear
(Fig. 1). Thus, an increase in preload will induce a signifi￾cant increase in stroke volume only if the ventricle operates
on the ascending portion of the relationship (condition of
ventricular preload dependence). In contrast, if the ventricle
operates on the flat portion of the curve, a similar increase
in preload will not induce any significant change in stroke
volume (condition of preload independence). Therefore, a
patient is a ‘responder’ to volume expansion only if both
ventricles operate on the ascending portion of the
Frank–Starling curve (biventricular preload dependence).
In contrast, if one of the ventricle or both ventricles operate
on the flat portion of the curves, then the patient is a ‘non￾responder’ (ie his/her cardiac output will not increase sig￾nificantly in response to volume expansion).
In normal physiological conditions, both ventricles operate
on the ascending portion of the Frank–Starling curve [1].

http://ccforum.com/content/4/5/282
This mechanism provides a functional reserve (preload
reserve) to the heart in situations of acute stress [1]. In
normal individuals, increase in preload was reported [2] to
result in a significant change in stroke volume. In contrast,
analysis of the literature indicates that, in patients with
acute circulatory failure, the mean rate of responders to
volume expansion is only around 50% (Table 1). This
finding emphasizes the need for predictive factors of
volume expansion efficacy in order to select patients who
could benefit from volume expansion and to avoid ineffec￾tive or even deleterious fluid therapy (worsening of pul￾monary oedema, haemodilution, etc) in ‘nonresponder’
patients, in whom inotropic and/or vasopressor support
should preferentially be used.
How to predict fluid responsiveness in
critically ill patients?
In many patients with acute circulatory failure, a positive
response to fluid therapy can be observed despite the
lack of clinical and biological indicators of hypovolaemia.
Therefore, bedside indicators of RV or LV preload are
usually used when deciding whether to give fluid.
A recent postal survey performed in Germany [3] showed
that central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlu￾sion pressure are used, respectively, by 93 and 58% of
intensive care unit physicians in the decision-making
process regarding volume expansion. However, many clini￾cal studies have emphasized the poor value of right atrial
pressure [4–7] and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure
[4,5,7–9] in predicting volume expansion efficacy. Indeed,
in most studies, the mean baseline value of right atrial
pressure and of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure was
not significantly different between responders and non￾responders to volume expansion [4–8,10] (Table 2). Even
when a significant difference was reported [9], a marked
overlap of individual baseline values was observed, so that
no threshold value could help to discriminate responder
and nonresponder patients. Other bedside indicators of
preload, such as the RV end-diastolic volume (evaluated
by thermodilution) and the LV end-diastolic area (mea￾sured by echocardiography) have also been tested as pre￾dictors of fluid responsiveness. Unfortunately, these
parameters were not found to be able to differentiate
accurately between responder and nonresponder patients
before fluid infusion was given (Table 2) [5,6,8,9,11].
All of these findings may be explained as follows. The right
atrial and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures do not
always reflect transmural pressures in patients with exter￾nal or intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
[12,13]. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure is not always
a good indicator of LV preload, in particular in patients
with a decreased LV compliance [14]. Measurement of RV
end-diastolic volume by thermodilution is influenced by tri￾cuspid regurgitation [15], which is frequently encountered
in critically ill patients with pulmonary hypertension. LV
end-diastolic area is not always a good indicator of the LV
end-diastolic volume, and hence of the LV preload [16].
RV dilatation may offset any beneficial haemodynamic
effect of volume expansion, even in case of a low LV
preload [17]. Finally, the preload-induced changes in
stroke volume depend also on contractility and afterload.
For example, a given value of preload can be associated
with preload dependence in normal hearts or with preload
independence in failing hearts (Fig. 2). Therefore, assess￾ment of preload is of poor value in predicting fluid respon￾siveness in critically ill patients.

Respiratory changes in right atrial pressure in
spontaneously breathing patients
In patients with significant spontaneous breathing activity,
the respiratory changes in right atrial pressure have been
proposed to differentiate patients whose hearts are func￾tioning on the flat part of the cardiac function curve from
those who still have volume reserves and are on the
ascending part of the curve [18,19]. Patients who had no
fall in the right atrial pressure with an inspiratory effort that
was sufficient to lower the pulmonary artery occlusion
pressure by 2 mmHg were proposed to be on the flat part
of their cardiac function curve [18]. Indeed, in 13 out of
the 14 patients in whom no fall in right atrial pressure was
observed, cardiac output did not increase with volume
challenges. In contrast, in 16 out of the 19 patients in
whom the right atrial pressure decreased by more than
1 mmHg during inspiration, cardiac output increased by
more than 250 ml/min in response to volume therapy [18].
Unfortunately, many patients in the intensive care unit do
not have adequate inspiratory effort, and therefore do not
have sufficient fall in pleural pressure to use this test to
predict fluid responsiveness [19].
Respiratory changes in LV stroke volume in
mechanically ventilated patients
In mechanically ventilated patients, the magnitude of the
respiratory changes in LV stroke volume can be used to
assess fluid responsiveness. Intermittent positive-pressure
ventilation induces cyclic changes in the loading condi￾tions of right and left ventricles (Fig. 3). Mechanical insuf￾flation decreases preload and increases afterload of the
right ventricle [20,21,22]. The RV preload reduction is due
to the decrease in the venous return pressure gradient
that is related to the inspiratory increase in pleural pres￾sure [20]. The increase in RV afterload is related to the
inspiratory increase in transpulmonary pressure (alveolar
minus pleural pressure) [22]. The reduction in RV preload
and the increase in RV afterload both lead to a decrease
in RV stroke volume, which is therefore at its minimum at
the end of the inspiratory period [23]. The inspiratory
impairment in venous return is assumed to be the main
mechanism of the inspiratory reduction in RV ejection
[24]. The inspiratory reduction in RV ejection leads to a
decrease in LV filling after a phase lag of two to three
heart beats because of the long blood pulmonary transit
time [25]. Thus, the LV preload reduction may induce a
decrease in LV stroke volume, which is at its minimum
during the expiratory period [23].
Two other mechanisms may also occur: mechanical insuffla￾tion may induce a squeezing of blood out of alveolar
vessels, and thus transiently increase LV preload [26]; and
the inspiratory increase in pleural pressure may decrease LV
afterload and thus facilitate LV ejection [27,28] (Fig. 3). The
first mechanism in hypervolaemic conditions and the
second mechanism in case of LV systolic dysfunction may
induce a slight increase in LV stroke volume during the
inspiratory period. However, experimental data suggest that

ventricular preload and stroke volume in a normal heart (A) and in a

preload dependence in a normal heart or with preload independence in
a failing heart.

these two mechanisms are only minor determinants of the
respiratory changes in LV stroke volume, even in the cases
of hypervolaemia [29,30] and LV dysfunction [29,31].
In summary, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation
induces cyclic changes in LV stroke volume (maximum
during the inspiratory period and minimum during the expi￾ratory period), which are mainly related to the expiratory
decrease in LV preload due to the inspiratory decrease in
RV filling and ejection (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, the cyclic changes in RV preload induced by
mechanical ventilation should result in greater cyclic
changes in RV stroke volume when the right ventricle
operates on the steep rather than on the flat portion of the
Frank–Starling curve [17,32]. The cyclic changes in RV
stroke volume, and hence in LV preload, should also result
in greater cyclic changes in LV stroke volume when the
left ventricle operates on the ascending portion of the
Frank–Starling curve [17,32]. Thus, the magnitude of the
respiratory changes in LV stroke volume should be an indi￾cator of biventricular preload dependence [33].
Respiratory changes in systolic pressure
Because LV stroke volume is a major determinant of sys￾tolic arterial pressure, analysis of respiratory changes in
systolic pressure has been proposed to assess the respi￾ratory changes in LV stroke volume during mechanical
ventilation. In 1983, Coyle et al [34] proposed that the
respiratory changes in systolic pressure could be analyzed
by calculating the difference between the maximal and the
minimal value of systolic pressure over a single respiratory
cycle (Fig. 4). This difference was called ‘systolic pressure
variation’ (SPV) and was divided into two components
(∆up and ∆down). These two components are calculated
using a reference systolic pressure, which is the systolic
pressure measured during an end-expiratory pause.
∆up is the difference between the maximal value of sys￾tolic pressure over a single respiratory cycle and the refer￾ence systolic pressure. It reflects the inspiratory increase
in systolic pressure, which results either from increase in
LV stroke volume related to the increase in LV preload
(squeezing of blood out of alveolar vessels) or a decrease
in LV afterload, or both; or an increase in extramural aortic
pressure related to the rise in pleural pressure.
∆down is the difference between the reference systolic
pressure and the minimal value of systolic pressure over a
single respiratory cycle. It reflects the expiratory decrease
in LV preload and stroke volume related to the inspiratory
decrease in RV stroke volume (see above).

Figure 3
Haemodynamic effects of mechanical insufflation. The LV stroke volume is maximum at the end of the inspiratory period and minimum two to three
heart beats later (ie during the expiratory period). The cyclic changes in LV stroke volume are mainly related to the expiratory decrease in LV
preload due to the inspiratory decrease in RV filling and output.

In mechanically ventilated dogs, Perel and coworkers
[29–31,35–37] demonstrated the following. First, in
normo- or hypovolaemic conditions, ∆down is the main
component of SPV [35–37]. Second, haemorrhage
increases SPV and ∆down [35–37]. Third, the amount of
blood loss is closely correlated with SPV and ∆down [35].
Fourth, volume expansion decreases SPV and ∆down
[35–37]. Finally, LV dysfunction [29,31] and hyper￾volaemia [29,30] increase ∆up, but decrease ∆down and
SPV such that, in this setting, SPV is minimal and ∆up is
the main component of SPV.
In mechanically ventilated patients, haemorrhage has also
been shown to increase SPV and ∆down [38], whereas
volume expansion has been shown to decrease SPV and
∆down [38,39]. More interestingly, Coriat et al [39]
reported a significant relationship between ∆down before
fluid infusion and the increase in cardiac index in response
to volume expansion in patients after aortic surgery. There￾fore, ∆down can be considered as an indicator of fluid
responsiveness, because the higher ∆down before volume
expansion, the greater the increase in cardiac index in
response to fluid infusion. This finding has been recently
confirmed by Tavernier et al [8] in patients with sepsis￾induced hypotension. In that study, a ∆down threshold
value of 5 mmHg allowed prediction of volume expansion
efficacy (defined as an increase in stroke volume ≥15%),
with positive and negative predictive values of 95 and
93%, respectively. Also, the baseline value of ∆down was
significantly correlated with the volume expansion-induced
increase in stroke volume (r = 0.76).
However, the respiratory changes in systolic pressure
result from changes in transmural pressure (mainly related
to changes in LV stroke volume) and also from changes in
extramural pressure (ie from changes in pleural pressure)
[40]. Therefore, respiratory changes in systolic pressure
may be observed despite no variation in LV stroke volume.
In this regard, Denault et al [41] recently demonstrated, in
anaesthetized cardiac surgery patients, that changes in
systolic pressure may reflect changes in airway pressure
and pleural pressure better than they reflect concomitant
changes in LV haemodynamics.
Respiratory changes in pulse pressure
The pulse pressure (defined as the difference between the
systolic and the diastolic pressure) is directly proportion￾nal to LV stroke volume and inversely related to arterial
compliance [42]. The pulse pressure is not directly influ￾enced by the cyclic changes in pleural pressure, because
the increase in pleural pressure induced by mechanical
insufflation affect both diastolic and systolic pressures. In
this regard, the respiratory changes in LV stroke volume
have been shown to be reflected by changes in peripheral
pulse pressure during the respiratory cycle [23]. There￾fore, it was recently proposed that fluid responsiveness
may be assessed by calculating the respiratory changes in
pulse pressure (∆PP) as follows:
(PPmax – PPmin) ∆PP (%) = 100 ×
(PPmax + PPmin)/2
where PPmax and PPmin are the maximal and minimal
values of pulse pressure over a single respiratory cycle,
respectively (Fig. 5).
In 40 patients with acute circulatory failure related to
sepsis, Michard et al [7] demontrated the following. First,
∆PP accurately predicted the haemodynamic effects of
volume expansion; a threshold value of 13% allowed dis￾crimination between responder (defined as patients who
experienced an increase in cardiac index ≥15% in
response to volume expansion) and nonresponder patients
with a sensitivity and a specificity of 94 and 96%, respec￾tively. Second, the baseline value of ∆PP was closely corre￾lated with the percentage increase in cardiac index in
response to volume expansion; the higher ∆PP was before
volume expansion, the greater the increase in cardiac index
(Fig. 6). Third, ∆PP was a more reliable indicator of fluid
responsiveness than were the respiratory changes in sys￾tolic pressure. Finally, the decrease in ∆PP induced by
volume expansion was correlated with the increase in
cardiac index, such that changes in ∆PP could be used to
assess the haemodynamic effects of volume expansion.

is divided in two components: ∆up and ∆down. ∆up is the difference
between the maximal and the reference systolic pressure. ∆down is the
difference between the reference and the minimal systolic pressure.

In summary, calculation of ∆PP may be of particular help in
the decision-making process regarding whether to institute
volume expansion. Indeed, if ∆PP is low (<13%), then a
beneficial haemodynamic effect of volume expansion is very
unlikely, and inotropes or vasoactives drugs should be pro￾posed in order to improve haemodynamics. In contrast, if
∆PP is high (>13%), then a significant increase in cardiac
index in response to fluid infusion is very likely. However, the
decision regarding whether to institute volume expansion
must take into account the risk of fluid therapy (worsening in
gas exchange), and a decrease in the mean airway pressure
(ie a decrease in tidal volume or in PEEP) is an alternative
therapeutic approach in this instance.
Interestingly, the assessment of cardiac preload depen￾dence is not only useful in predicting volume expansion
efficacy, but also in predicting the haemodynamic effects
of any therapy that induces changes in cardiac preload
conditions. In this regard, ∆PP has been shown to be
useful in monitoring the haemodynamic effects of PEEP in
mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury.
Indeed, the decrease in mean cardiac output induced by
PEEP and the decrease in RV stroke volume induced by
mechanical insufflation share the same mechanisms (ie
the negative effects of increased pleural pressure on RV
filling and of increased transpulmonary pressure on RV
afterload). Thus, the magnitude of the expiratory decrease
in LV stroke volume would correlate with the PEEP￾induced decrease in mean cardiac output.
In 14 mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung
injury [43] the following was demonstrated. First, ∆PP on
zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) was closely corre￾lated with the PEEP-induced decrease in cardiac index;
the higher ∆PP was on ZEEP, the greater the decrease in
cardiac index when PEEP was applied (Fig. 7). Also, the
increase in ∆PP induced by PEEP was correlated with the
decrease in cardiac index, such that changes in ∆PP from
ZEEP to PEEP could be used to assess the haemody￾namic effects of PEEP without the need for a pulmonary
artery catheter. Finally, when cardiac index decreased with
PEEP, volume expansion induced an increase in cardiac
index that was proportional to ∆PP before fluid infusion.
It is likely that analysis of the respiratory changes in LV
stroke volume could also be useful to monitor the haemo￾dynamic effects of ultrafiltration during dialysis or of any
change in ventilatory parameters.
Limitations
Analysis of the respiratory changes in arterial pressure is
not possible in patients with cardiac arrythmias. Moreover,
these parameters have been validated in sedated and
mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, whether the
respiratory changes in LV stroke volume predict fluid
responsiveness in nonsedated and in spontaneously
breathing patients remains to be evaluated.
As mentioned above, the respiratory changes in LV stroke
volume might also result from a decrease in LV afterload
caused by the inspiratory increase in pleural pressure

ventilated patient. The pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic
pressure) is maximal (PPmax) at the end of the inspiratory period and
minimal (PPmin) three heart beats later (ie during the expiratory
period). The respiratory changes in pulse pressure (∆PP) are
calculated as the difference between PPmax and PPmin, divided by
the mean of the two values, and expressed as a percentage (see text
for details). Adapted with permission [33].

expansion. Adapted with permission [7].

[21,28]. Thus, the respiratory changes in LV stroke volume
could theoretically be an indicator of afterload dependence,
rather than of preload dependence, for example in patients
with congestive heart failure. In fact, it is unlikely that the
inspiratory increase in LV stroke volume can be responsible
for large variations in LV stroke volume and hence in arterial
pressure, even in the case of LV dysfunction [29,31]. In
animals, induction of an experimental cardiac dysfunction
was showed to result in a decrease rather than an increase
in systolic pressure variation [29,31].
Because the pulse pressure depends not only on stroke
volume, but also on arterial compliance, large changes in
pulse pressure could theoretically be observed despite
small changes in LV stroke volume if arterial compliance is
low (elderly patients with peripheral vascular disease). Sim￾ilarly, small changes in pulse pressure could be observed
despite large changes in LV stroke volume if arterial com￾pliance is high (young patients without any vascular
disease). In fact, a close relationship between baseline
∆PP and the changes in cardiac index induced by volume
expansion was observed in a series of patients with a large
range of ages and comorbidities [7], suggesting that the
arterial compliance poorly affected the relationship
between respiratory changes in LV stroke volume and ∆PP.
Noninvasive assessment of respiratory changes in LV
stroke volume
Although less invasive than pulmonary artery catherization,
femoral or radial arterial catheterization remains an inva￾sive procedure. Infrared photoplethysmography coupled
with the volume clamp technique [44] allows a non￾invasive and continuous measurement of finger blood
pressure, which has been shown to track changes in
blood pressure accurately [45]. In mechanically ventilated
patients, we recently found a close correlation and a good
agreement between ∆PP measured from intra-arterial
recordings and ∆PP measured noninvasively using the
continuous measurement of finger blood pressure [46].
The respiratory changes in LV stroke volume can also be
assessed noninvasively by Doppler echocardiography.
Indeed, by assuming that aortic annulus diameter is con￾stant over the respiratory cycle, the changes in aortic
blood flow should reflect changes in LV stroke volume.
Therefore, the respiratory changes in aortic blood velocity
have also been proposed to assess fluid responsiveness
in mechanically ventilated patients [47].
Whether other methods, such as beat-to-beat measure￾ments of aortic blood flow by oesophageal Doppler or of
stroke volume from the pulse contour analysis, may be
used to assess the respiratory changes in LV stroke
volume and hence cardiac preload dependence remains
to be determined.
Conclusion
Right atrial and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures are
still extensively used to decide whether to employ fluid
therapy [3], although many clinical studies have empha￾sized the poor value of cardiac filling pressures in predict￾ing volume expansion efficacy. In sedated and
mechanically ventilated patients, analysis of the respiratory
changes in LV stroke volume allows an accurate evalua￾tion of cardiac preload dependence, and thus of fluid
responsiveness. In the future, the assessment of respira￾tory changes in arterial pressure should be automated and
displayed on a monitor, which may facilitate and possibly
improve the cardiorespiratory management of mechani￾cally ventilated patients.
