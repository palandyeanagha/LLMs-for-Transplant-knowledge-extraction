Background: A transjugular liver biopsy (TJLB) specimen is often smaller or more fragmented than a
percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) specimen. Recently, for PLB, the minimum requirements to evaluate chronic
hepatitis have been set at 20–25 mm length and >11 complete portal tracts.
Aim: To evaluate and compare length of TJLB and PLB specimens, portal tract number, fragmentation and
adequacy for histopathological diagnosis and staging.
Patients and methods: 326 consecutive TJLB specimens in 274 patients (109 who had undergone a
transplantation), always using three passes (19-G Tru-cut) and 40 consecutive PLB specimens (15-G
Menghini).
Results: No technical failures occurred with the TJLB, and histological diagnosis was possible in 98.5%.
The median (range) number of fragments was 5 (1–13) and the median total length was 22 (3–46) mm,
with 65% of specimens >20 mm and 36% >25 mm; 60% of TJLB specimens were >28 mm long had >11
complete portal tracts. No difference in complete portal tract number or biopsy length was found between
PLB and TJLB specimens.
Conclusion: A TJLB specimen with three passes is adequate for histological diagnosis, with 89% of
specimens being either >15 mm or having >6 complete portal tracts. Although adequate sampling
remains a limitation for staging and grading of chronic hepatitis, TJLB is comparable to PLB in this respect.
L
iver biopsy is the gold standard for histological confirma￾tion, diagnosis and severity of liver disease.1 2
Percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) and transjugular liver
biopsy (TJLB) are most often used.1 3–7 PLB is usually used
first,8 9 and TJLB is used if there are contraindications such as
major coagulopathy or moderate ascites.7 10–12 However, TJLB
is considered to be less satisfactory than PLB because smaller,
more fragmented and thinner samples are obtained more
often.1 10
Liver biopsy specimens represent approximately 1/50 000
of the liver.10 Several studies have evaluated the minimum
length and number of portal tracts necessary for optimal
histological evaluation. Diagnostically, a PLB specimen of
>15 mm length has been considered to be necessary for
accurate diagnosis in chronic liver disease13; a review10 also
concluded that 6–8 complete portal tracts should be present
for diagnosis, most histopathologists accepting six portal
tracts. However, with the increasing need to assess fibrosis in
chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,
specimens of 20–25 mm length or >11 complete portal tracts
have been considered to be necessary to reliably assess
grading and staging, and to reduce sampling errors.14 15
However, TJLB has received less attention, with the
evaluation of only small cohorts.16–20 Our aim was to evaluate
length, fragmentation and number of portal tracts in a large
TJLB series and to audit sample adequacy in relation to
recently proposed standards for diagnosis, and grading and
staging.14 15
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We evaluated 326 consecutive TJLB specimens in 274 patients
between January 2003 and May 2004. The main indications
for TJLB were (a) prothrombin time >5 s from control or
platelet count ,50 000/mm3
; (b) gross ascites, small cirrhotic
liver or severe obesity; and (c) for patients with a liver
transplant, a protocol liver biopsy or differential diagnosis of
abnormal liver function tests, when either coagulopathy,
cardiovascular compromise or patient cooperation might
jeopardise the safe undertaking of a PLB.
We collected routine demographic, clinical and laboratory
data. TJLB specimens were taken in the interventional
radiology suite, after written consent, with continuous
monitoring by electrocardiography and of oxygen saturation.
The right internal jugular vein was punctured under
ultrasound guidance after local anaesthesia. A guide wire
(Cordis Corporation, Miami, Florida, USA) followed by a
sheath was introduced into the inferior vena cava and, then,
using a Cobra catheter (Cordis Corporation), to the hepatic
veins, under fluoroscopic control. Hepatic phlebography was
carried out to evaluate hepatic vein anatomy. The needle was
inserted towards the liver via a 5.0-F catheter and a sample
obtained by passing the needle through the hepatic vein wall.
All procedures were carried out by an experienced radiologist
or hepatologist using a 19-G (Cook (Sandet 6, DK-4632
Bjaeverskov) or Kimal (Middlesex, UB8 2SA, UK)) Tru-cut
type biopsy needle (maximum core length 15–20 mm and
external diameter 1 mm). Three passes were performed, our
standard procedure since January 2003, regardless of size and
adequacy of each core from each pass. After this, a small
amount of contrast media was injected to check for capsular
puncture. TJLB was considered technically unsuccessful if it
was impossible to obtain a liver sample for any reason. Major
complications (ie, a supraventricular tachycardia, capsular
perforation or intraperitoneal haemorrhage) were always
recorded. Day cases were followed up in hospital for up to
6 h, and inpatients for 24 h. Formal reporting by patients of
any subsequent problems was evaluated from their discharge
information sheet. Patients were seen within 2 weeks to
discuss biopsy results.

We also evaluated 40 consecutive PLB specimens in
patients without cirrhosis with abnormal liver function tests,
considering them to be a comparison group. The PLB was
carried out using a 15-G Menghini needle (Unomedical Ltd,
Redditch, UK). All TJLB and PLB specimens were formalin
fixed and embedded in a paraffin wax block. Serial sections,
5 mm thick, were cut and stained with haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E), reticulin, Victoria blue, Masson Trichrome and
Perls’ method for iron. Pathologists (APD and AQ) initially
reviewed biopsy sections without the clinical information.
The number and length of each fragment (cores that were
completely separated) were recorded. The length (mm) was
measured with a ruler. The width (mm) was evaluated in a
random cohort of 40 TJLB specimens using measurement
under the microscope, recording the maximum diameter
found. The total length was given by adding the fragment
lengths. A sample was ‘‘too fragmented’’ when the histo￾pathologists decided that the fragment number and size did
not permit histological interpretation.
The portal tracts in each fragment on H&E-stained sections
were counted both as complete portal tracts and as partial
portal tracts (PPTs) as defined by Crawford et al21—that is,
‘‘focus of connective tissue containing at least two luminal
structures’’. A portal tract was considered to be complete
when its full circumference was visible, or when at least three
quarters of the circumference and three luminal structures
(portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct) were visible. A
portal tract was considered to be partial when its circumfer￾ence was incomplete and contained any two luminal
structures. Foci with only one luminal structure were not
counted as portal tracts. A single portal tract and its branches
cut on a tangential plane can appear as multiple adjacent
portal tracts. In this instance, we regarded these structures as
part of a single portal tract, when in the projection trajectory
of the ramification of a dominant portal tract with little
interposed parenchyma. When relatively large portal tracts
(ie, containing septal bile ducts (.100 mm) or medium sized
(40–100 mm) interlobular bile ducts22) were seen, complete
portal tracts were defined only if all three portal structures
were visible, and partial portal tracts if only two structures
were present. Connective tissue cut longitudinally, along side
the biopsy edges, or large areas of connective tissue attached
to the end of the biopsy core and containing only one vein,
artery or bile duct were not considered to be portal tracts.
Portal tracts were not counted in TJLB specimens that had
severe architectural distortion (ie, cirrhosis, advanced fibrosis
and massive necrosis), because it was not possible to reliably
recognise, separate and count individual portal tracts, in
keeping with a previous publication evaluating portal tract
number.23 This is because with severe fibrosis and cirrhosis,
fibrous bridging is accompanied by loss of the portal tract
boundaries, abnormal vascularisation, bile duct loss and
ductular reaction, resulting in complete effacement of the
lobular architecture. The total number of complete portal
tracts or PPTs was the summation of complete portal tracts or
PPTs, respectively, in each fragment. The total portal tract
number was the summation of total complete portal tracts
and PPTs.
To evaluate fragmentation in reducing the number of
complete portal tracts, we evaluated the PPTs at each end of
each fragment (and not at its sides), considering them to be
contiguous when there were .3 fragments (each represent￾ing one pass of the three passes performed at each biopsy),
and thus representing the maximum theoretical number of
complete portal tracts.
Statistical analysis
All data were analysed using the statistical package SPSS
V.10.0. The x2 test was used for comparing qualitative
variables and the t test and Mann–Whitney U test for
comparing quantitative variables. Quantitative variables
normally distributed were expressed as mean (standard
deviation (SD)) and non-normally distributed as median
values (range). Significance testing was two sided and set at
p,0.05. The correlation between total length and total
number of complete portal tracts in each TJLB specimen
and in each fragment (ie, as a separate liver biopsy) was
evaluated by Spearman’s correlation. Comparisons were
made between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic biopsies, non￾transplant versus transplant biopsies and between biopsies
carried out for grading and staging (known chronic hepatitis
C, alcoholic liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis before
transplant) and others carried out for diagnostic reasons, and
those for both diagnosis and staging or grading.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
The 274 patients had a median age of 51 (13–87) years and
174 (63.5%) were men; 165 were patients who did not have a
liver transplant, each underwent only one TJLB. In the 109
patients with a liver transplant, 16 had two TJLBs, 10 had 3, 4
had 4 and 1 had 5 TJLBs (table 1).
In patients who did not have a liver transplant, 126 (77%)
had suspected primary liver disease and 25 (15%) had
underlying haematological disease. There were 70 (42%)
patients with cirrhosis and 95 (58%) without cirrhosis. In all,
48 of 126 (29%) had alcoholic liver disease/non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis. Table 1 shows detailed diagnoses. Hepatitis C
virus-related cirrhosis was the major indication for liver
transplant in 42 (38.5%) patients, followed by alcoholic liver
disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in 24 (22%) and pri￾mary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis in 15
(14%; table 1).
Characteristics of TJLB specimens
No TJLB failed to obtain liver samples using three passes. The
specimen was adequate for histological diagnosis in all but 5

(1.5%) samples: three were too small and two were too
fragmented. We recorded no major complications.
Evaluation of fragmentation, length, width and portal
tracts, and comparison with PLB specimens
The median total length was 22 (range 3–46) mm, with a
median of 5 (range 1–13) fragments; 290 (89%) TJLB
specimens were >15 mm long, 213 (65%) were >20 mm
and 116 (36%) were >25 mm. We found no significant
difference in total length between specimens from patients
with and without cirrhosis (23 v 22 mm, p = 0.07), and also
in the median number of fragments (4 v 5, p = 0.08). We also
found no significant difference in length between biopsy
specimens from patients with or without liver transplant (23
v 22 mm, p = 0.45). Biopsy specimens of patients without a
transplant had less fragments than those of patients with a
transplant (4 v 5, p = 0.035; table 2). The maximum width
was a median of 0.6 (range 0.5–0.8) mm.
In 132 TJLB specimens (58% in patients without a liver
transplant/22% in those with a liver transplant, p,0.001),
40% of the total, portal tracts were not counted because of
cirrhosis (n = 85, 64.4%), severe fibrosis (n = 20, 15.1%),
severe infarction or necrosis (n = 18, 13.6%), ductopenia
(n = 7, 5.2%) and excessive fragmentation (n = 2, 1.5%)
(table 2). Thus, portal tracts were counted in 194 TJLB
specimens: median number of total portal tracts (sum of
complete portal tracts and PPTs) was 13 (range 2–38);
median total number of complete portal tracts was 8 (range
0–26) and median number of PPTs was 5 (range 0–16). The
median ratio of complete portal tracts to PPTs was 1.6 (range
0–12).
The median length and complete portal tracts in the biopsy
speciemens taken for diagnostic purposes (n = 202) or solely
for staging or grading (n = 124) or for both (n = 137) were as
follows: length, 22 (3–46), 22 (9–44) and 22 (9–44) mm, and
the number of complete portal tracts, 8 (0–26), 8 (3–25) and
8 (3–25), respectively. The proportions of TJLB specimens
>15 mm were 89%, 88% and 87%, and those >25 mm were
34%, 38% and 38% in the three groups, respectively. The
proportion of TJLB specimens with >6 complete portal tracts
were 73%, 82% and 80%, and those with >11 complete portal
tracts were 26%, 24% and 24% in the three groups,
respectively. We found no significant differences (all
p.0.89). We also found no differences when solely consider￾ing TJLB for chronic hepatitis C, in which the median length
was 22 (range 10–41) mm and the number of complete portal
tracts was 8 (3–25) versus all of the other biopsies, in which
the median length was 22 (3–46) mm and the number of
complete portal tracts was 8 (0–26). In biopsies of patients
with chronic hepatitis C, 88.5% were >15 mm and 38% were
>25 mm long.
In 76% of 194 TJLB specimens, we found >6 complete
portal tracts; these specimens were significantly longer than
those with ,6 complete portal tracts (median length 22 v
15 mm, p,0.001). In addition, TJLB specimens with >11
complete portal tracts (26%) were significantly longer than
those with ,11 complete portal tracts (median length 28 v
20 mm, p,0.001). Although all TJLB specimens with >11
complete portal tracts were .15 mm, only 50% of those
>25 mm had >11 complete portal tracts. Finally, we found
no significant difference between TJLB specimens from
patients without or with a liver transplant regarding the
number of complete portal tracts (8.5 v 8, p = 0.19) and PPT
specimens (6 v 5, p = 0.17; table 2).
In the PLB specimens, the median total length and the
number of complete portal tracts were 17 (range 5–49) mm
and 7 (range 0–18) mm, respectively, which were not
significantly different compared with TJLB specimens (med￾ian length 22 (range 3–46) mm and the median number of
complete portal tracts 8 (0–26); p = 0.35).
Correlation between the length and complete portal
tracts in TJLB specimens
This was assessed in the 194 TJLB specimens (Spearman’s
r = 0.49, p,0.001; fig 1). A TJLB specimen >28 mm long
contained >11 complete portal tracts in 60% cases versus
16% when ,28 mm (p,0.001; fig 1).
In the 194 TJLB specimens, 1045 fragments were obtained
(fig 2). The distribution of fragment length was similar in all
TJLB specimens. Generally, longer fragments contained more
complete portal tracts (fig 2); 212 of 277 (76.5%) fragments
1 mm long had no complete portal tracts, and the remainder
had 2–3 complete portal tracts (fig 2). Considering the 1045
fragments as separate liver specimens, we found good
correlation between fragment length and complete portal
tracts (r = 0.72, p,0.001). From these data, we can estimate
that on average a non-fragmented specimen >23 mm long
would be needed to obtain the optimal number of 11
complete portal tracts—that is, the partial portal tracts at
the ends (but not at the sides) of all fragments but three
would be considered to be contiguous, assuming each pass
would obtain one unfragmented core. Thus, both an increase
in length and reducing fragmentation of TJLB are required to
improve the number of adequate liver biopsy specimens.
DISCUSSION
Liver biopsy is an essential diagnostic tool in acute or chronic
liver disease and in particular to estimate grading or
staging.1 10 Adequate specimen size is crucial for accurate
histological interpretation and elimination of sampling error
and intraobserver or interobserver variability,24 25 but liver
biopsy may still be suboptimal.14 15 26 Apart from length,
width and fragmentation also determine the quality of a liver

biopsy specimen. For this reason, counting complete portal
tracts is a better and more appropriate parameter for
evaluation of adequacy of a liver biopsy and, thus, is the
most suitable parameter to compare different kinds of liver
biopsy specimens (eg, percutaneous versus transjugular, or
Menghini versus Tru-cut, or using different needle sizes)
rather than solely the length or width of the specimen.10 15
Liver biopsy specimens with at least six complete portal tracts
are considered to be adequate for diagnosis of diffuse liver
disease.10
Assessing antiviral treatment has renewed interest in liver
biopsy quality. Changes in inflammation (grading) and
fibrosis (staging) after antiviral treatment represent end
points in most clinical trials. Recent studies14 15 estimated
that grade and stage were adequately assessed only in
samples 20–25 mm long or containing >11 complete portal
tracts. According to these criteria, both PLB and TJLB usually
provide inadequate specimens: using a 17-G Menghini
needle, only 42% of PLB specimens had >10 complete portal
tracts,23 and in the largest PLB series 45% were ,20 mm
long.27 In our study, 37.1% of TJLB specimens contained >10
complete portal tracts and only 26% had >11 complete portal
tracts. Using three passes, the median number of complete
portal tracts was 8. From the correlation (fig 1), a median
number of 11 complete portal tracts could be achieved after
.3 passes, as 60% of TJLB specimens >28 mm long have
>11 complete portal tracts.
TJLB has often been considered to be suboptimal as a
result of a higher frequency of inadequate specimens, related
to the initial aspiration technique yielding small specimens,
which were often excessively fragmented.28 29 The develop￾ment of a Tru-cut TJLB has improved the quality without any
increase in complications.19 30 Despite this, the perception of
being a second-class biopsy persists, and is reinforced further,
considering the current ‘‘optimal’’ PLB criteria.14 15 However,
TJLB has some intrinsic characteristics that paradoxically
could make it a more appropriate technique for liver biopsy,
obtaining optimal specimens even with the current stan￾dards. Multiple cores can be obtained, in contrast with PLB in
which .1 pass causes increased complications.6 12 31 In TJLB,
provided the liver capsule is not punctured (does not occur
with experienced operators), complications do not increase
with multiple passes.17 26 31–33 Minor complications such as
neck pain are also infrequent as previously audited by our
group.33 However, the diameter of the TJLB needle is usually
smaller than that used in PLB, and fragmentation is also
thought to be worse.10
Only 11 studies have evaluated Tru-cut TJLB in terms of
the type of needle, number of passes, length, fragmentation
and number of portal tracts (table 3).16–19 34–40 In these studies,
an average of 2.7 passes per patient yielded specimens of
mean length 14 (standard deviation (SD 2.6) mm) and a

mean number of 6.4 (SD 2.3) complete portal tracts (table 3).
Only three studies included >100 TJLB specimens; one
reported results using a 1.2-mm diameter needle (number of
passes not recorded), the mean length was 16.5 (SD
6.1) mm37; the second study reported a mean number of
5.6 portal tracts in 123 TJLB specimens38 and the last study
evaluated 193 TJLB specimens with a mean length of
18 mm.19 In the last two studies, needle diameter and
number of passes are not mentioned. In addition, only one
study documented the number of fragments (mean 2.5), but
the number of passes was not given.17
Our study on TJLBs using three passes per procedure in 326
biopsy specimens (274 patients) is the largest study evaluat￾ing quality. We focused our evaluation on the portal tract
assessment using published criteria,21 as Bravo et al10 showed
that portal tract number was the most reliable parameter,
and Colloredo et al14 stated that ‘‘The critical factor influen￾cing the negative effect of smaller sizes is probably the
significant drop in number of complete portal tracts in the
smaller specimens’’.
In our study, liver specimens were sufficient for diagnosis
in 98.5% of cases similar to other studies on TJLB using 18-G
needles,18 30 37 or a 19-G needle20 as in ours. The median
length was 22 mm, and most importantly, the median
number of complete portal tracts was 8. These results
confirm the diagnostic efficacy of TJLB according to
published guidelines10 and show that TJLB with three passes
provides samples comparable with those obtained by PLB
from our centre and from other series on PLB.23 27 41 In
addition, as we showed in a recent review, the median length
of a PLB specimen was 19.8 mm for Menghini and 14.5 mm
for a Tru-cut biopsy specimen, and the median number of
complete portal tracts was 6.6 for Menghini and 5.8 for a Tru￾cut biopsy,42 so that about 50% of PLB specimens reported in
series in the literature are suboptimal for diagnostic purposes.
In our study, we found no major difference in the length or in
the number of fragments between patients with or without
cirrhosis, whereas differences have been reported for
percutaneous biopsy specimens.42 This may be due to our
standardised procedure for handling TJLB. Fragmentation
may occur after biopsy during transport to the histopathology
laboratory, and usually it has been reported on the fixed
specimen and not at the time of biopsy.42 In addition, the
previously asserted inadequacy of TJLB for diagnosis of
cirrhosis29 was not confirmed. Our pathologists, using H&E,
reticulin and Victoria blue stains, were always able to confirm
the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis, even from one sufficiently
large fragment.
We found no differences in the number of complete portal
tracts or in the length or proportions of specimens >15 or
>25 mm long, in the biopsies carried out mainly for
diagnosis, mainly for staging or grading, or from these
groups when carried out for both. Thus, TJLB with three
passes almost always gives optimal biopsy specimens for
diagnosis (in contradistinction to data on PLB in the
literature), but only results in adequate biopsy specimens
for staging or grading in 38% (>25 mm) or 25% (>11
complete portal tracts).
Our study is also the first in which the number of complete
portal tracts and PPTs has been evaluated in a TJLB series.
The median ratio of complete portal tracts to PPTs was 1.6:1,
but we found only a modest correlation between the total
length and total number of complete portal tracts (r = 0.49).
This finding may be due to two reasons: (1) the small
diameter of liver samples or (2) fragmentation. The 19-G
needle has an external diameter of 1 mm and an internal
diameter (which in fact determines the maximum width of
the liver core) of approximately 0.9 mm. However, the width
in several fragments was ,0.5 mm or was variable, even in
the same fragment. Crawford et al21 and Menghini,43 also
found variable and smaller widths of biopsy specimens (0.9
(SD 0.3) mm and average 0.75 mm diameter, respectively)
than the internal needle diameter when using 14-G or a 1.5-
mm-diameter Menghini needle. In our study, using Tru-cut
needle, this phenomenon may be exacerbated because the
slot in the Tru-cut needle is not cylindrical—the height of the
space is less than its width. The range of widths is because
the microtome cutting planes through the biopsy core do not
always go through its maximum diameter, so that the
internal needle diameter is not equivalent to biopsy width. In
addition, there is tissue shrinkage with fixation embedding
and some twisting of the tissue core. As a result, in our study,
several lengthy fragments contained very few or even no
complete portal tracts, but nevertheless >11 complete portal
tracts were obtained with core widths (1 mm, in contra￾distinction to that by Colloredo et al.
14 Using an 18-G needle
could improve this, but requires further evaluation because it
is less flexible and increases the fragmentation rate.20 40
From our assessment of the number of complete portal
tracts and PPTs in each fragment, using three passes, it can

be estimated that 50% of three non-fragmented cores of
23 mm total length would contain 11 complete portal tracts.
However, in clinical practice, fragmentation can not be
eliminated completely, but improvements might be made
by more careful handling of TJLB samples. In our cohort,
considering fragmentation, the median total length (to
contain 11 complete portal tracts) was 28 mm.
In summary, obtaining at least three cores at each TJLB
was safe, and resulted in a median length of 22 mm
independent of the presence of cirrhosis. The median number
of complete portal tracts in TJLB was 8 and that in PPT was 5.
We found an average of five fragments in each TJLB.
Reduction in fragmentation or modification of the length of
the notch in the Tru-cut device would increase the number of
complete portal tracts. The characteristics of our TJLB with
three passes are better than those obtained by the average
PLB reported in the literature.23 27 41 42
