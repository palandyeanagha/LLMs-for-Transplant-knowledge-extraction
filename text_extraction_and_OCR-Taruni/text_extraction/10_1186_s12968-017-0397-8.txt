Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction in the absence
of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T1-mapping at rest and
during adenosine stress can assess coronary vascular reactivity. We hypothesised that the non-contrast T1 response
to vasodilator stress will be altered in patients with T2DM without CAD compared to controls due to coronary
microvascular dysfunction.
Methods: Thirty-one patients with T2DM and sixteen matched healthy controls underwent CMR (3 T) for cine, rest
and adenosine stress non-contrast T1-mapping (ShMOLLI), first-pass perfusion and late gadolinium enhancement
(LGE) imaging. Significant CAD (>50% coronary luminal stenosis) was excluded in all patients by coronary
computed tomographic angiography.
Results: All subjects had normal left ventricular (LV) ejection and LV mass index, with no LGE. Myocardial perfusion
reserve index (MPRI) was lower in T2DM than in controls (1.60 ± 0.44 vs 2.01 ± 0.42; p = 0.008). There was no
difference in rest native T1 values (p = 0.59). During adenosine stress, T1 values increased significantly in both T2DM
patients (from 1196 ± 32 ms to 1244 ± 44 ms, p < 0.001) and controls (from 1194 ± 26 ms to 1273 ± 44 ms, p < 0.
001). T2DM patients showed blunted relative stress non-contrast T1 response (T2DM: ΔT1 = 4.1 ± 2.9% vs. controls:
ΔT1 = 6.6 ± 2.6%, p = 0.007) due to a blunted maximal T1 during adenosine stress (T2DM 1244 ± 44 ms vs.
controls 1273 ± 44 ms, p = 0.045).

Conclusions: Patients with well controlled T2DM, even in the absence of arterial hypertension and significant CAD,
exhibit blunted maximal non-contrast T1 response during adenosine vasodilatory stress, likely reflecting coronary
microvascular dysfunction. Adenosine stress and rest T1 mapping can detect subclinical abnormalities of the
coronary microvasculature, without the need for gadolinium contrast agents. CMR may identify early features of the
diabetic heart phenotype and subclinical cardiac risk markers in patients with T2DM, providing an opportunity for
early therapeutic intervention.

Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), independent of coronary
artery disease (CAD) or hypertension, directly affects the
structure and function of the myocardium [1], leading to
adverse cardiovascular outcomes [2–4]. There is a robust
association between T2DM and heart failure, and heart fail￾ure is the leading cause of mortality in patients with T2DM
[5–8]. Coronary microvascular dysfunction in diabetes is a
complex pathophysiological process, which involves struc￾tural, functional and metabolic alterations, and has emerged
among the potential mechanisms leading to increased inci￾dence of heart failure [9] and risk of cardiovascular mortal￾ity [4, 10] in patients with diabetes. Using cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR), myocardial perfusion during
vasodilator stress has been shown to be impaired in pa￾tients with diabetes mellitus (DM) [11–13] and in the ab￾sence of epicardial coronary artery stenoses, this finding is
indicative of coronary microvascular dysfunction.
CMR non-contrast T1-mapping may be used to assess
myocardial ischaemia and coronary vasodilatory function.
In CMR, T1 (or proton spin-lattice) relaxation time is a
magnetic property of tissue. Each tissue type has a normal
range of T1 values, deviation from each may indicate dis￾ease or a change in physiology. T1 is prolonged by in￾creased free water content [14], which may have an
intracellular or extracellular origin, including the interstitial
and intravascular compartments. Healthy controls demon￾strate normal myocardial T1 values at rest; during adeno￾sine stress, coronary vasodilation leads to an increase in
myocardial blood volume in the myocardium, which is de￾tectable using myocardial T1-mapping, through the partial
volume of blood T1 [14–16]. We have previously demon￾strated the use of adenosine stress and rest non-contrast
T1-mapping for detecting ischaemia in patients with CAD,
and for assessing coronary vasodilatory reserve in patients
without CAD [17, 18]. In the absence of obstructive CAD,
the percentage change in non-contrast T1 values from rest
to vasodilator stress (ΔT1) likely represents coronary vascu￾lar reactivity and has potential to assess the health and
function of the micro coronary circulation.
We hypothesize that patients with T2DM but without
obstructive CAD will have microvascular dysfunction
detectable using adenosine stress and rest T1-mapping.
In this study, we compared native myocardial T1 values
at rest and during adenosine stress, as well as myocardial
perfusion reserve index (MPRI) in patients with T2DM
without obstructive CAD and in matching healthy con￾trols using CMR at 3 Tesla.
Methods
The study was granted a favourable opinion by the Na￾tional Research Ethics Committee (REC Ref 13/SW/0257),
and written informed consent was obtained from each
participant. The main project was set out to investigate
the intricate interplay of perfusion, oxygenation and meta￾bolic changes during stress in the diabetic heart. The
wider aims and methods of the main project has been
published elsewhere [13].
Study population
T2DM was diagnosed according to the World Health
Organization criteria [19]. Patients with T2DM were ex￾cluded if they had a history of cardiovascular disease, chest
pain, tobacco smoking, uncontrolled hypertension (resting
systolic blood pressure (BP) >140 mmHg and diastolic BP
>90 mmHg), contraindications to CMR imaging, ischemic
changes on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), or significant
renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate
below 30 mL/min), and if they were taking insulin. Import￾antly, patients with T2DM were initially screened for ob￾structive epicardial CAD (>50% of luminal stenosis) with
coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA).
Only subjects with no evidence of significant epicardial
CAD on CCTA underwent the study investigations.
Healthy subjects were age-, gender- and weight￾matched to patients and served as controls. Healthy con￾trols had no history of heart disease, DM, hypertension,
or high cholesterol and were taking no medications.
They had normal physical examinations and ECG.
Other study procedures
BP was recorded as an average of 3 supine measurements
taken over 10 min (DINAMAP-1846-SX, Critikon Cor￾poration, Tampa, Florida, USA). Fasting venous blood was
Levelt et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:81 Page 2 of 10

drawn for glucose, triglyceride, haemoglobin A1c and
renal function tests as previously described [20].
Coronary computed tomographic angiography
CCTA scans were performed on a 64-slice CT scanner
(Discovery CT 690, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wiscon￾sin, USA) in accordance with performance guidelines
from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomog￾raphy [21]. In the absence of contraindications, patients
received beta-blockade (intravenous metoprolol) and
sublingual nitroglycerine prior to the scan to achieve a
heart rate of <65 beats per minute and coronary dilation,
respectively. A preliminary unenhanced scan was per￾formed to assess coronary artery calcium score. During
the CCTA acquisition, 80 ml of iodinated contrast (Visi￾paque, GE Healthcare, Princeton, New Jersey, USA) was
injected followed by a 50 ml saline flush. Significant
CAD was defined as >50% luminal stenosis. CCTA was
carried out 1 week prior to CMR study for each partici￾pant withT2DM.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol
CMR was performed on a 3-Tesla system (Magnetom
Trio Tim; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). All
participants were instructed to refrain from caffeine in￾gestion in the 24 h preceding the study. All subjects
were scanned after fasting overnight. Cine imaging was
performed in long- and short-axis covering the left ven￾tricle (LV) using standard balanced-steady state free pre￾cession (bSSFP) methods [22].
At rest, mid LV native T1 map was acquired using the
shortened modified Look-Locker inversion recovery
(ShMOLLI) prototype sequence as previously described
[14], matched to the first-pass stress and rest perfusion
mid-LV slices. Adenosine stress perfusion imaging was
performed as previously described [23, 24] with acquisi￾tion of 3 matched short axis stress and rest perfusion
images. Briefly, adenosine (140 μg/kg/min to 210 μg/kg/
min to achieve adequate hemodynamic stress response)
was infused intravenously for at least 3 min. Heart rate
and blood pressure were recorded at baseline and at 1-
min intervals during stress. This was followed by acqui￾sition of a single mid-ventricular short-axis T1-map
(matched to the mid-ventricular T1-map at rest). Subse￾quently (4–5 min after commencing the adenosine infu￾sion), a 0.03-mmol/kg bolus of gadolinium-based
contrast Gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet LLC,
Villepinte, France) was injected, followed by 15 mL of
normal saline at a rate of 6 mL/s for first-pass perfusion
imaging. Adenosine was then discontinued, and after at
least 20 min (to allow contrast washout adenosine), an￾other 0.03-mmol/kg bolus of gadolinium was given for
rest perfusion imaging.
For late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR, a top￾up bolus of 0.09 mmol/kg of contrast (Gadoteric acid,
Guerbet, France) followed by a 15-mL saline flush was
administered immediately after the rest perfusion image
acquisition (total dose of gadolinium 0.15 mmol/kg).
The LGE images were acquired using a T1-weighted
phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence 8–12 min
after the last intravenous administration of contrast
agent in the same long- and short-axis images as cine
imaging, using imaging parameters as previously de￾scribed [25]. A single mid-ventricular short-axis slice
matching the pre-contrast T1-map was acquired 15 min
after the administration of gadolinium contrast for extra￾cellular volume fraction (ECV) quantification.
CMR data analysis
For each patient, LV volumes, ejection fraction, and mass
were calculated using cmr42© software (Circle Cardiovas￾cular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Canada) by manually tracing
the endocardial and epicardial contours in end-diastolic
and end-systolic images, as previously described [22].
For the analysis of ShMOLLI T1-maps, the LV myo￾cardium of the mid ventricular short axis slice acquired
at baseline was contoured by two operators (EL, SKP),
using dedicated software, as previously described [26],
providing a single average myocardial T1 value from the
whole slice of T1 map per each individual with consen￾sus of two operators. T1-maps were assessed for quality
in three ways: examination of the T1-map, the raw T1
images and R2 maps; ~11% of segments were excluded
due to any combination of: off-resonance artifacts,
partial-volume effects, poor T1 fit on the R2 maps, pa￾tient movement or low signal to noise, similar to previ￾ous publications using T1-mapping from our center
[27]. The myocardial T1 value from the stress mid￾ventricular ShMOLLI non-contrast T1-map was ob￾tained and compared to the non-contrast T1 at baseline
(Fig.1).
T1 reactivity to adenosine stress was expressed in ab￾solute terms: ΔT1(ms) = T1stress–T1rest and as per￾centages: (ΔT1) (%) = ΔT1÷T1rest × 100. T1rest and
T1stress represent mean T1 values at rest and during
adenosine stress, respectively. Inter-observer variability
of mid-ventricular ShMOLLI T1-map stress reactivity
was assessed by further analysis performed by another
independent operator in a blinded fashion (RSW). Inter￾study variability of mid-ventricular ShMOLLI T1-map
stress reactivity was assessed in 5 healthy subjects of an￾other study performed at our research centre (REC ref￾erence: 13/SC/0376). These scans were anonymized and
analyzed in random order in a blinded fashion (AL).
For analysis of myocardial perfusion, signal intensity
over time curves were generated by tracing endocardial
and epicardial contours (cmr42© software, Circle
Levelt et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:81 Page 3 of 10

Cardiovascular Imaging Inc.) after manual correction for
displacement during breathing, by two operators (AL, EL).
A region of interest was drawn in the LV blood pool,
avoiding any papillary muscles, to permit the derivation of
an arterial input function. The myocardium was divided
into equiangular segments on the basis of the American
Heart Association 16-segmentation model. Rest and stress
myocardial perfusion up-slopes were calculated using a 5-
point linear-fit model of SI versus time and normalized to
the LV blood pool upslope. Myocardial perfusion reserve
index (MPRI) was defined as the ratio of stress to rest
relative upslope, as previously described [28].
For LGE analysis, areas of contrast enhancement were
visually scored as absent or present by 2 operators with at
least 3 years of CMR experience (EL, MM). LGE was con￾sidered present only if myocardial enhancement was con￾firmed on both short-axis and perpendicular long-axis
locations. Consistent with established methods of estimat￾ing myocardial ECV using a delayed postcontrast bolus
protocol [29, 30], we measured precontrast and postcon￾trast myocardial and blood T1 values. These assessments
were carried out by two operators together by consensus
(EL, SKP), using previously described methods [30].
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviations and
checked for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
Categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages.
Comparisons between the 2 groups were performed by Stu￾dent’s t-test. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was
used to compare discrete data as appropriate. Bivariate cor￾relations were performed using Pearson’s or Spearman’s
method as appropriate. A p-value <0.05 was considered sig￾nificant. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
Statistics (version 20; International Business Machines, Inc.,
Armonk, New York, USA).
Results
Participant characteristics
Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data of pa￾tients with T2DM and controls matched for age, gen￾der and body mass index (BMI) are shown in Table 1.
31 patients with T2DM (median duration of diabetes
7 years [IQR: 1–8] and mean glycated haemoglobin
level 7.7 ± 1.4%) and 16 controls were studied. Al￾though resting heart rates were statistically higher in
patients, these remained within the normal range
(T2DM resting heart rate: 69 ± 8 vs. controls: 58 ± 10
beats per minute, Table 1). Diastolic BP and resting
heart rate were statistically higher in the diabetic co￾hort, although remained within the normal range. A
significant proportion of patients (77%) were on statin
therapy, hence total cholesterol and low-density

lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in diabetics
compared to controls.
Myocardial structure and systolic function
CMR results for LV volumes and function are summarized
in Table 2. There was no significant difference in LV ejec￾tion fraction between patients with T2DM and healthy
controls. There was also no difference in LV mass and LV
mass index between patients and healthy controls, though
patients with T2DM exhibited concentric LV remodelling
(LV mass to volume ratio T2DM: 0.96 ± 0.18 g/ml vs.
healthy controls: 0.75 ± 0.23 g/ml; p = 0.001).
Myocardial fibrosis on late gadolinium enhancement
imaging
On visual assessment of LGE images, there were no
areas of myocardial enhancement indicative of myocar￾dial infarction or focal replacement fibrosis in either pa￾tients or healthy controls.
Changes in myocardial perfusion reserve during
adenosine stress
Rest and stress rate pressure product values are sum￾marised in Table 3. Patients and healthy controls dem￾onstrated a similar increase in rate pressure product
during adenosine stress (p = 0.206). Despite the absence
of significant obstructive epicardial CAD on CCTA and
adequate response to adenosine vasodilatory stress,
MPRI was significantly reduced in T2DM patients com￾pared to controls (T2DM MPRI, 1.60 ± 0.44 vs healthy
controls, 2.01 ± 0.42; p = 0.008). A sub-group analysis of
lean T2DM patients (BMI < 25) vs lean controls for the
MPRI was performed and our results showed in the ab￾sence of obesity or even overweight status T2D is associ￾ated with reduced MPRI (1.50 ± 0.27 vs lean controls
2.24 ± 0.36, p = 0.005).
Inter-study reproducibility, inter-observer and intra￾observer variability of stress native T1 mapping
The inter-study reproducibility, inter-observer and intra￾observer variability of mid-ventricular ShMOLLI T1-
map stress reactivity were assessed.

5 healthy subjects (2 males, 3 females; age 41 ± 23 years;
all 1.5 T, mid-ventricular slice stress/rest). All 10 scans
anonymized and analyzed in random order. The interval
between scans for these participants undergoing test-retest
inter-study reproducibility was 3 ± 2 years apart. There was
a good agreement between the first and second scans
(0.33 ± 1.13%). Mean ΔT1 for the first scan (6.2 ± 1.0%)
was not significantly different compared to the second scan
(6.5 ± 1.0%), paired t-test p = 0.55.
There was a good agreement for inter-observer
(−0.3 ± 1.7%) and intra-observer assessments
(−0.2 ± 1.4%) by Bland-Altman plotting. Coefficient of de￾termination showed strong relationship for inter-observer
(r2 = 0.759) and intra-observer (r2 = 0.837) assessments.
Changes in rest and adenosine stress T1 mapping
There were no significant differences in native myocar￾dial non-contrast T1 values between T2DM patients and
healthy controls at rest. During adenosine stress, T1
values increased significantly in both T2DM patients
(from 1196 ± 32 ms to 1244 ± 44 ms, P < 0.001) and
healthy controls (from 1194 ± 26 ms to 1273 ± 44 ms,
p < 0.001) (Fig.2). However, stress T1 response was sig￾nificantly blunted in T2DM patients compared to healthy
controls (T2DM ΔT1 = 4.1 ± 2.9% vs. healthy controls
ΔT1 = 6.6 ± 2.6%, p = 0.007) (Fig.3), as was the maximal
T1 during adenosine stress (T2DM: 1244 ± 44 ms vs.
healthy controls: 1273 ± 44 ms, p = 0.045). A sub-group
analysis of lean T2DM patients (BMI < 25) vs lean con￾trols for the ΔT1 was performed and our results showed
in the absence of obesity or even overweight status T2D is
associated with T1 (3.51 ± 2.18 vs lean controls
6.21 ± 1.72, p = 0.013).
There was no significant correlation between the percent
change of T1 and MPRI. However, there was a significant
correlation between the adenosine stress T1 and MPRI
(r = 0.35, p = 0.031), when there was no significant correl￾ation between rest T1 and MPRI (r = −0.19, p = 0.31).
Maximal T1 during adenosine stress and T1 reactivity
(ΔT1) correlated negatively with LV mass index
(r = −0.50, p = 0.001; r = −0.40, p = 0.018) and LV con￾centricity (LV mass to LV EDV ratio)(r = −0.33,
p = 0.027; r = −0.41, p = 0.005) in the study group as a
whole, but no significant correlation in separate groups.
Extra-cellular volume (ECV) quantification
There was no significant difference in ECV between
T2DM patients and controls (T2DM 30 ± 3%, vs healthy
controls 30 ± 2%, p = 0.91).
Discussion
In this study using CMR stress and rest T1-mapping, we
demonstrate that T2DM is associated with blunted na￾tive T1 response under adenosine stress even in highly
selected T2DM patients with stable disease and no other

comorbidities. The blunted maximal stress T1 response
in T2DM, as well as the impaired myocardial perfusion
reserve index, are consistent with attenuated vascular
reactivity and coronary microvascular dysfunction. Add￾itionally, we show a negative correlation between stress
T1 and concentric LV remodelling, suggesting a link be￾tween the subclinical abnormalities in coronary vasodila￾tory function and adverse cardiac remodeling in diabetes.
However, the causality of this relationship needs to be in￾vestigated in future studies.
Coronary microvascular dysfunction in diabetes is
likely to be a multifactorial phenomenon, related to
changes in perivascular and interstitial fibrosis [31],
myocardial hypertrophy [32], reduced capillary density,
and autonomic neuropathy [33]. Importantly, coronary
microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of car￾diovascular events and was shown to be associated with
a 2.5% annual major adverse event rate that includes car￾diovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, and heart failure even among patients
without epicardial coronary artery stenosis [34]. Conse￾quently, early identification of coronary microvascular
disease may be beneficial in prognosis evaluation and
patient stratification for optimal medical therapy [35].
Myocardial perfusion is influenced by multiple factors
including metabolic demand, diastolic time, and driving
blood pressure [36]. The functional responsiveness of
the microcirculation can be influenced by increased
heart rate, reduced diastolic time, decreased driving BP.
An increase in systolic intramyocardial and ventricular
pressures, as it would be expected to occur in LV con￾centric remodelling, can also adversely affect myocardial
perfusion. In this study, although it remained within the
normal limits, the resting heart rates were higher in pa￾tients with T2DM compared to healthy controls. Fur￾thermore, patients with T2DM also demonstrated LV
concentric remodeling. The higher rate pressure product
at rest in our patients with T2DM would be expected to
cause a higher resting perfusion, as a result may lead to
lower MPRI; on the other hand the LV concentric re￾modeling would be expected to reduce the resting perfu￾sion. The influence of these important factors on the
coronary physiology is intricate, and should be consid￾ered while interpreting the myocardial perfusion abnor￾malities in patients with diabetes.
CMR T1-mapping for the assessment of coronary
vasodilatory function
Heart failure is the leading cause of mortality in patients
with T2DM [5] and importantly coronary microvascular
dysfunction is considered among the pathophysiological
alterations in diabetes responsible for cardiac dysfunction
[1]. In the context of the global epidemic of diabetes, cor￾onary vascular reactivity, as assessed by rest and adenosine
stress T1-mapping, may serve as an additional biomarker
for disease severity and therapeutic response without the
need for gadolinium-based contrast agents. Furthermore,
this gadolinium-free technique is easily applicable, inde￾pendent of heart rate and robust to tachyarrhythmias [14,
37], making it highly suitable for CMR scanning during
vasodilator stress. This study shows that the technique is
sensitive to detecting subtle changes in vascular reactivity
in this patient group, in agreement with traditional first
pass perfusion, paving the way to future mechanistic studies
of further alterations of ΔT1 in overt diabetic cardiomyop￾athy, or for use in patients with diabetes and more signifi￾cant comorbidities, including renal failure. CMR stress/rest
T1 mapping may prove a convenient tool to assess poten￾tial beneficial effects of novel therapies designed for patients
with T2DM on the myocardium and coronary vasculature,
and to monitor drug response, without the need for re￾peated exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents.
First-pass myocardial perfusion CMR during vasodila￾tory stress directly assesses reductions in microvascular
blood flow with high diagnostic accuracy. CMR studies
of the coronary circulation exploit the first-pass kinetics
of T1-enhancing extracellular gadolinium-based contrast
media. During the first pass, the contrast medium dif￾fuses into the interstitial space from the microvascula￾ture, resulting in an increase in signal intensity that is
proportional to the perfusion and blood volume of the
tissue, the extravascular compartment size, and capillary
permeability.
It is conceivable that in the future adenosine rest/
stress T1 mapping may become a valuable test in
addition to conventional clinical information and perfu￾sion assessment for patients with diabetes. Early identifi￾cation of changes using these techniques may lead to
improved clinical outcomes by preventive interventions.
This method may provide surrogate markers of long￾term prognostic effects without the need for gadolinium,
making it also available for diabetic patients with end￾stage kidney disease. However, reproducibility assess￾ments, transferability between centers, and translatability
between field strengths and vendors, are requirements
which are not yet all fulfilled with adenosine stress and
rest T1 mapping [38] and future studies are needed to
address these lacunae, innovatively. As a result, first pass
perfusion imaging persists as the robust and validated
tool for assessment of myocardial perfusion, despite its
limitations in patients without contraindications to use
contrast agents.
Study limitations
This study was limited by a relatively small sample size,
and larger-scale future studies with long follow-up are
necessary to determine the prognostic value of stress T1
response. Furthermore, as an observational study, we
Levelt et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:81 Page 7 of 10

cannot determine the mechanisms for the observed dif￾ferences in MPRI and T1 stress response.
Whilst the demonstration of a robust inter-study re￾producibility for any technique is important to support
the technique’s clinical and research application, due to
ethical considerations regarding a second administration
of adenosine with an additional hospital visit in this
study was deemed too high a burden on study subjects
as this could lead to higher risk of adverse event rates,
and high drop-out rates. Consequently, in our study we
have not assessed the inter-study reproducibility of the
adenosine stress T1 mapping. Further studies are needed
to demonstrate the inter-study reproducibility of adeno￾sine stress T1 mapping.
Although resting heart rates were statistically higher in
patients, we have previously demonstrated that T1 esti￾mation using the ShMOLLI technique is independent of
heart rate variations (40 to 100 beats/min) over the ap￾plicable range of T1 values in phantoms and simulations
at 1.5- and 3.0-Tesla [39]. Therefore, any potential con￾founding effects due to technical heart rate dependen￾cies on the findings in this study are negligible, and the
observed T1 values most likely reflect true physiologic
and pathophysiologic changes in healthy controls and
patients, respectively.
Despite statistical differences in stress ΔT1 between
T2DM patients (4.1 ± 2.9%) and healthy controls
(6.6 ± 2.6%), there are numerical overlaps between these
values. The effect size to detect significant differences
between diabetic patients and healthy controls using
stress ΔT1 is respectable (Cohen’s d 1.2), which is com￾parable to the difference in myocardial perfusion reserve
index between fractional flow reserve -negative (MPRI
1.8 ± 0.5) and fractional flow reserve-positive (MPRI
1.2 ± 0.3) epicardial coronary lesions using gadolinium￾enhanced stress perfusion CMR (Cohen’s d 1.4 [40]). Liu
et al., previously showed that stress T1-mapping is inde￾pendent of field-strength between 1.5 and 3 T [18]. Con￾sidering the abolished stress ΔT1 values for ischemic
myocardium (0.2 ± 0.8%) at 1.5 T [41], the effect size for
detecting a significant difference between diabetic pa￾tients (4.1 ± 2.9%) vs. ischemic myocardium (0.2 ± 0.8%)
is higher (Cohen’s d 1.8). This suggests that the detec￾tion of myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients using
gadolinium-free stress T1-mapping is possible, without
the need for gadolinium contrast agents, and deserves
further investigation.
Adenosine is the most commonly used agent for CMR
perfusion studies, and it increases blood flow mostly by
non-endothelial-dependent mechanisms via receptors on
microvascular smooth muscle cells that modulate intra￾cellular calcium [42]. Thus, the lower MPRIs and T1
stress responses observed in T2DM patients in this
study might be the result of decreased vasodilation via
both endothelium-dependent and -independent path￾ways. However, a complete characterisation of coronary
microvascular function also requires the assessment of
response to vasoconstrictor stimuli (acethylcholine, er￾gonovine), which can be performed only during an inva￾sive coronary angiogram. Subjecting our participants to
invasive coronary angiography, with even a small risk of
complications, was deemed unacceptable for asymptom￾atic patients. Adenosine is shown to assess mostly non￾endothelial-dependent coronary flow changes, and there￾fore we cannot completely rule out that endothelial￾dependent coronary flow abnormalities may have affected
our findings. Similarly, because we haven’t carried out in￾vasive assessment of coronary physiology, the diameter
changes in response to an exogenous donor of nitric
oxide, isosorbide dinitrate, could not be assessed, and
therefore impaired responsiveness of underlying vascular
smooth muscle cells or structural changes of the vascular
wall cannot be excluded with certainty.
Absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion would
have been interesting for direct comparison with abso￾lute T1 quantification under stress and rest conditions.
However, quantitative perfusion analysis is relatively
cumbersome, requiring specialized computational soft￾ware with mathematical assumptions and some recog￾nized limitations [43].
The incidence of T2DM is driven predominantly by
the obesity epidemic, and there is no doubt that obesity
is a strong contributor to diabetic cardiomyopathy [44].
There is a significant overlap between the obesity related
and diabetes related heart disease phenotypes. Both
conditions are associated with LV concentric remodeling
[4, 45–47], coronary microvascular dysfunction, myocar￾dial energetic impairment [44] and increased risk of
heart failure [4]. In our study, a third of (11 out of 31)
T2DM patients were obese (35 > BMI > 30), 10 out of
31 patients were normal weight (BMI < 25), and the
remaining 10 patients were overweight (25 < BMI < 30).
This study aimed to prove the concept that adenosine rest
and stress non-contrast T1 mapping would detect signifi￾cant differences in patients with T2DM free of obstructive
epicardial CAD on CTCA, in-keeping with coronary micro￾vascular dysfunction. In sub-group analysis we have de￾tected significant differences in MPRI and T1reactivity,
suggesting that in the absence of obesity or even overweight
status T2D is associated with coronary microvascular dys￾function. Given the comorbidity of obesity in a third of our
patients with T2DM in this study, impact of obesity on the
cardiac abnormalities cannot be dismissed; however, this is
in fact not within the scope of our study aims.
Finally, CCTA was not performed in the healthy co￾hort to prevent unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure.
Significant CAD was deemed to be very unlikely in this
cohort.

Conclusions
Patients with well controlled T2DM, even in the absence
of arterial hypertension and significant epicardial CAD,
exhibit blunted maximal T1 response during adenosine
vasodilatory stress, likely reflecting coronary micro￾vascular dysfunction, as well as early signs of LV concen￾tric remodelling without overt LVH. Adenosine stress
and rest T1 mapping can detect subclinical functional
abnormalities of the coronary microvasculature, without
the need for gadolinium contrast agents.
In the future, CMR and particularly T1 mapping at
stress may be used to identify early features of diabetic
heart disease and subclinical risk markers in patients
with T2DM, providing an opportunity for early thera￾peutic intervention.
