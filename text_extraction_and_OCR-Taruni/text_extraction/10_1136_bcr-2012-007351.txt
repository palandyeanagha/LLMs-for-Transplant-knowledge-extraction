SUMMARY
A 25-year-old woman with a history of bilateral lung
transplant secondary to cystic fibrosis presented with
non-specific abdominal complaints and was found to
have acute kidney injury, thrombocytopaenia and
laboratory findings consistent with a microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia. Her thrombotic microangiopathy
(TMA) was attributed to tacrolimus, which was
discontinued and replaced with cyclosporine with
resolution of her TMA and no subsequent complications.
This is the fifth reported case of TMA associated with
tacrolimus use in a lung transplant patient, and the third
to be successfully managed with cyclosporine
substitution. Clinicians must be aware of this
uncommon, but likely under-reported complication of
tacrolimus therapy in lung transplant recipients.
Cyclosporine replacement may be used as a successful
therapy to treat tacrolimus-associated TMA without
increasing the risk of acute rejection that may be
associated with other treatment strategies.
BACKGROUND
As the number of transplant recipients and their
survival increase, awareness of common and
complex management issues associated with lung
transplantation is increasingly important for both
primary care and subspecialty providers.
Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy
(TA-TMA) is an increasingly well-recognised com￾plication in these patients, and is similar but clinic￾ally distinct from other thrombotic
microangiopathies like thrombotic thrombocyto￾paenic purpura (TTP).1 Calcineurin inhibitors such
as tacrolimus are commonly implicated in the
development of TA-TMA after both solid organ
and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
which can occur at any time after initiation of
therapy. The disorder rarely presents with the
classic pentad of symptoms, and can be fatal if left
undiagnosed.1–3 There are scant case reports of
TA-TMA in lung transplant recipients, creating sig￾nificant potential that this serious disease may be
missed outside specialty centres. Early discontinu￾ation of the offending agent may be the most
promising treatment strategy for this condition,
with additional adjunctive therapies including
therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) reserved for
more serious or refractory cases. Replacement of
tacrolimus with cyclosporine may represent an
effective, low risk management strategy of TA-TMA
that reduces the risk of acute rejection
complications.1 4
CASE PRESENTATION
A 25-year-old woman with medical history of bilat￾eral lung transplant 15 months earlier for complica￾tions of cystic fibrosis presented to the emergency
department with a week of severe, progressive
fatigue, easy bruising, decreased appetite, nausea,
abdominal pain and a single episode of vomiting.
Her medical history included two prior episodes of
acute rejection, a history of successfully treated
childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia and chronic
active hepatitis C with a recent viral count of
4 550 000 IU/ml; prior liver biopsy demonstrated
grade 1 inflammation and stage 0 fibrosis. Her
immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus
4.5 mg in the morning and 4 mg at night, prednis￾one 10 mg daily, mycophenylate 720 mg twice a day
and sirolimus 3 mg twice a day with prophylactic tri￾methoprim/sulfamethoxazole. She is married and
denied HIV risk factors. Physical examination was
significant for multiple ecchymoses and mild diffuse
abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. She
did not have any other localising signs of infection.
INVESTIGATIONS
Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normo￾cytic anaemia (Hgb 8 g/dl) decreased from her
prior baseline of 11.4 g/dl 4 months earlier, and a
platelet count of 54×10(9)/l (159×10(9)/l 10 days
earlier). Creatine was elevated at 3 mg/dl (baseline
0.84 mg/dl) and liver function tests were normal.
Evaluation of a peripheral blood smear confirmed
her anaemia and thrombocytopaenia and demon￾strated a significant number of schistocytes. Lactate
dehydrogenase was elevated at 886 units/l and
haptoglobin was markedly decreased, suggesting
haemolysis. Prothrombin and partial thromboplas￾tin times were normal. Acute abdominal series was
normal and right upper quadrant ultrasound
showed no evidence of gall bladder or biliary
abnormalities. Tacrolimus and sirolimus levels were
normal at 8 and 5 ng/ml, respectively. β-HCG was
negative, and her ADAMTS13 activity level was
76% (normal >60%). The Naranjo Score, a com￾monly recognised tool to assess the likelihood that
a change in clinical status is the result of an adverse
drug reaction rather than disease progression or
other factors, was 5 (adverse drug reaction
probable).
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
TA-TMA belongs to the family of thrombotic micro￾angiopathies (TMAs), which include TTP, haemolytic
uremic syndrome, pregnancy-associated microangio￾pathy and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia

(MAHA) associated with a variety of systemic vasculidities and
other autoimmune disorders.1356 TMA is a syndrome that repre￾sents a final common pathway of endothelial injury, microcircula￾tory thrombosis and fibrin deposition, leading to microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia and platelet consumption.
TTP is classically described as a pentad of fever, neurological
and renal impairment, MAHA and thrombocytopaenia without
another underlying aetiology.1 3 Idiopathic TTP is typically due
to an inherited defect, genetic mutation or acquisition of inhibi￾tory antibodies to ADAMTS13, a protease enzyme responsible
for cleaving large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers.
Treatment includes plasma infusion or TPE, with other
immunosuppressive agents employed with variable success in
refractory cases. TA-TMA and TTP were originally thought to
be due to similar mechanisms of endothelial damage; however,
low ADAMTS13 levels are rarely found in TA-TMA and the
benefit of TPE remains uncertain based on the pooled data pub￾lished in the latest TA-TMA consensus guidelines.1
There are multiple potential contributing causes to the develop￾ment of TA-TMA. The disorder is most often seen in haematopoe￾tic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients, more commonly in
allogeneic than autologous transplant recipients, with a reported
incidence of 10–25%.1 2 The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine
and tacrolimus have been identified as contributing factors to
TA-TMA in both HSCTand solid organ transplant recipients, with
endothelial damage from tissue ischaemia at the time of transplant￾ation, an additional risk factor in renal transplant patients.178 Use
of sirolimus in addition to tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) prophylaxis has been associated with increased risk of
TA-TMA, although these individuals appear to have a more
favourable renal prognosis and overall survival compared with
TA-TMA patients on a calcineurin agent alone.
TREATMENT
Our patient received intravenous fluid resuscitation, and tacrolimus,
sirolimus and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were discontinued.
With this conservative therapy, her acute kidney injury, thrombo￾cytopaenia and laboratory evidence of MAHA rapidly improved
(figures 1 and 2). She was discharged on hospital day 4 with pred￾nisone 10 mg daily, mycophenylate 720 mg twice a day, trimetho￾prim/sulfamethoxazole DS 1 tab daily and was started on
cyclosporine 200 mg twice a day.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient demonstrated no clinical evidence of recurrent
TMA or short-term evidence of acute rejection upon close
follow-up and re-evaluation. Over the next month, the patient
received frequent lab draws that demonstrated complete reso￾lution of her anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, and acute kidney
injury to baseline levels. Based on this rapid clinical response,
tacrolimus was felt to be the offending agent and she was con￾tinued on cyclosporine without rechallenge to her prior
immunosuppressive regimen. Although she has experienced
further transplant related complications since this event, she has
not demonstrated further evidence of TMA over 2.5 subsequent
years of serial follow-up.
DISCUSSION
Tacrolimus, a derivative of the fungus Streptomyces tsukubaensis,
is a macrolide lactone and is used as a potent immunosuppressant
in organ transplantation. It suppresses cellular immunity by
binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, and complexing with
calcineurin-dependent proteins to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase
activity and T-lymphocyte activation.1278 TMA, a rare but
serious complication secondary to tacrolimus, has been reported
in 1–4.7% of adult transplant patients. In a review of 91 solid
organ transplant recipients with tacrolimus-associated TMA, 81%
of cases were seen in renal transplant patients, 8% in liver trans￾plant patients, and less than 1% in lung and heart transplant
patients.7–10 TMA is more common in women and typically pre￾sents within the first year of transplant, although the reaction
appears to be independent of both the duration and serum levels
of tacrolimus. Severity of presentation can range from an asymp￾tomatic elevation in serum creatine to the classic pentad of clinical
symptoms, and can be fatal if diagnosis is delayed. The mechanism
of tacrolimus-associated TMA is unknown, although postulated
mechanisms of endothelial injury include direct cytotoxic damage
and injury mediated by platelet activation, elevated VWF and
thrombomodulin, altered complement regulation and decreased
nitric oxide and prostacyclin production.
Without treatment, TMA is associated with significant mortality.
Contrary to the clinical experience with TTP, a summary of 11 het￾erogeneous clinical studies using TPE for TA-TMA in HSCTrecipi￾ents demonstrated a median clinical response of only 36.5%
(range 0–80%) and an associated mortality of 80% (range 4–
100%).128 In a transplant patient where TMA is believed to be
caused by calcineurin inhibitors, removal or dose reduction of the
offending agent and supportive care alone have been shown to be
an effective treatment strategy, but are not without risk. In one
case series of 21 transplant patients with tacrolimus-induced TMA
who were treated with drug discontinuation, 2 patients (10%)

subsequently lost their grafts due to acute on chronic rejection and
3 (14%) died of multiple organ failure.
Another published strategy to mitigate the risk of rejection
and other complications of reduced immunosuppression is to
replace tacrolimus with another immunosuppressive agent, typ￾ically cyclosporine. Although cyclosporine is known to lead to
TMA in up to 3% of renal transplant patients, it has been
shown to provide effective immunosupression without perpetu￾ating evidence of TMA in cases due to tacrolimus. This is
believed to be possible because cyclosporine binds to different
cytosolic proteins within target cells as well as having a different
molecular structure.
Only three other cases have been published describing
tacrolimus-induced TMA in lung transplant recipients.8–10 All
patients, with the exception of our case, were older (mean age,
SD 58±4 years old), and had received lung transplantation for
severe, lifestyle limiting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Including our patient, the majority (3 of 4) of patients were
women and had developed TMA greater than 12 months after
transplant (8, 15, 24 and 30 months), in contrast to commonly
associated demographic features in other solid organ transplant
populations. In all cases, the offending agent was stopped;
cyclosporine was initiated in its place. All patients demonstrated
complete recovery from their TMA with therapy. No patients
demonstrated evidence of short-term acute rejection as a result
of these changes to their immunosuppressive regimen. One
patient did develop cyclosporine toxicity and acute kidney
injury, which resolved with discontinuation of cyclosporine and
conservative management.
Although rare, TA-TMA can be associated with a high death
rate unless recognised and treated appropriately. We reported a
case of tacrolimus-associated TA-TMA that resolved without
GVHD or other complications by stopping the offending agent
and then replacing her current immunosuppressive regimen
with cyclosporine. High suspicion by primary care providers
can help manage these complex medical issues in transplant
recipients.
Learning points
▸ Transplant thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare but
described complication of tacrolimus therapy, which can be
life threatening without recognition and appropriate
treatment.
▸ Tacrolimus-induced thrombotic microangiopathy may be
more frequent than previously recognised in lung transplant
recipients, and can occur later in the post-transplant course
than is seen in other solid organ transplant patients.
▸ Discontinuation of tacrolimus and initiation of cyclosporine
therapy can be an effective management strategy in lung
transplant patients to treat this condition and prevent
short-term complications of acute rejection.
