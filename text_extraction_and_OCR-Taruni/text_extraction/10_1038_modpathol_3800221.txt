Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is expressed in endothelial and
spindle cells of nearly all Kaposi sarcomas, and the presence of this antigen in serum is strongly correlated with
the risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma in immunocompromised individuals. Studies of vascular tumors
occurring in the general population show LANA expression to be specific for Kaposi sarcoma. No study to date,
however, has examined whether non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors arising in immunocompromised patients
may express LANA, possibly reflecting origin from an HHV-8-infected endothelial progenitor cell. The objective
of this study was to evaluate the specificity of LANA expression for Kaposi sarcoma in immunocompromised
patients by LANA immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HHV-8. A total of 13
cases of non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors (12 hemangiomas and one epithelioid hemangioendothelioma)
and 24 cases of Kaposi sarcoma, all from known HIV-positive patients, were immunostained for LANA and
evaluated for the presence of HHV-8 DNA by real-time PCR. LANA expression was seen in 22 of 24 (92%) of
Kaposi sarcoma cases and in 0 of 13 non-Kaposi sarcoma cases. Real-time PCR detected HHV-8 in all of the
Kaposi sarcoma cases and in four of the non-Kaposi sarcoma cases (all hemangiomas). LANA expression
appears to be a highly sensitive and specific marker of Kaposi sarcoma in both the general population and in
HIV-positive patients. This is in contrast to HHV-8 PCR, which is positive in a small subset of non-Kaposi
sarcoma vascular tumors, most likely due to detection of HHV-8 within intratumoral blood mononuclear cells by
the highly sensitive real-time PCR technique. For this reason, LANA immunohistochemistry is preferable to
HHV-8 PCR for the evaluation of problematic vascular proliferations in HIV-positive individuals.

Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is a recently de￾scribed gamma herpesvirus, that was first identified
as an etiologic agent in Kaposi sarcoma in 1994 by
Chang et al,
1 who isolated DNA sequences of HHV-8
from endothelial cells in Kaposi sarcoma lesions
from patients with the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS). The development of antibodies to
the HHV-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen is
considered the hallmark of latent HHV-8 infection,
and seropositivity for antibodies to Latency-asso￾ciated nuclear antigen (LANA) is found in over 85%
of patients with Kaposi sarcoma as compared with
only 1–4% of the general population.2,3 The pre￾sence of LANA antibodies in HIV-positive patients
strongly correlates with the risk of developing
Kaposi sarcoma.4
Monoclonal antibodies to LANA have recently
been developed for use in formalin-fixed and frozen
tissues, and have been shown to be reliable markers
of latent HHV-8 infection in Kaposi sarcoma as
well as other HHV-8-associated processes, such Received 18 March 2004; revised 27 May 2004; accepted 30 May

as primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric
Castleman disease.5,6 A small number of studies
have shown LANA expression to be specific for
Kaposi sarcoma among vascular tumors occurring in
the general population.6–9 Evaluation of LANA
expression has thus been proposed as an ancillary
technique for the discrimination of Kaposi sarcoma
from other vascular lesions with which it may be
confused, such as stasis-associated vascular prolif￾erations, spindle cell hemangioma, kaposiform
hemangioendothelioma, and spindled variants of
angiosarcoma. It is currently unknown, however,
whether non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular lesions aris￾ing in immunocompromised patients might express
LANA, possibly reflecting origin from an HHV-8-
positive endothelial progenitor cell, or secondary
HHV-8 infection. We therefore studied a group of
Kaposi sarcoma and non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular
tumors arising in known HIV-positive patients, for
evidence of HHV-8 coinfection using LANA immu￾nohistochemistry (IHC) and HHV-8 real-time PCR.
Materials and methods
Samples
The Emory University and Grady Memorial Hospital
Institutional Review Boards granted approval for
this study. We retrospectively examined 37 forma￾lin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples obtained from
37 patients who had undergone resection or biopsy
at Grady Memorial Hospital between 1993 and 2003.
All patients were serologically positive for HIV by
enzyme-linked immunoassay and Western blot. The
patients ranged in age from 22 to 61 years, and
included 35 male and two female patients. The non￾Kaposi sarcoma lesions (n ¼ 13) included 12 capil￾lary hemangiomas and one epithelioid hemangioen￾dothelioma, and represented all of the available
non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors occurring in
HIV-positive individuals in our institutions. The
Kaposi sarcoma cases (n ¼ 24) ranged histologically
from early patch to nodular stage. Both Kaposi
sarcoma and non-Kaposi sarcoma lesions included a
broad range of anatomic sites. The diagnoses for all
cases were reconfirmed by an experienced soft￾tissue pathologist (ALF) prior to inclusion in the
study.
Immunohistochemistry
Sections, 5 mm thick, were cut and placed on
charged glass slides. The slides were then immu￾nostained with the LANA antibody (Clone 13B10,
1:50, Novocastra) using steam heat-induced epitope
retrieval and the Dako Envision system according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Negative con￾trols consisted of substitution of buffer for the
primary antibody. The presence of any nuclear
staining was scored as ‘positive’.
TaqMan Real-Time PCR
Two 5-mm paraffin-embedded sections were cut from
each block and placed in Eppendorf tubes, dewaxed
at 981C for 15 min, and suspended in proteinase K
digestion buffer for 1 h at 681C. This was followed by
DNA extraction using a QIAamp kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). The samples were then cen￾trifuged, and the supernatant was suspended in TE
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The quality of the
extracted DNA was confirmed by b-actin amplifica￾tion. A body cavity B-cell lymphoma cell line
(BCBL) was used as a positive control. Water was
used as a negative control. An arbitrary fluorescence
threshold value of 30 and cycles-to-threshold value
of 50 was used. A value over the fluorescence
threshold of 30 and within 50 cycles-to-threshold
was considered a positive result.
The PCR reaction was performed on SmartCycler
(Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 501C for 2 min,
951C for 10 min. This was followed by 50 cycles at
951C for 15 s and 601C for 1 min. The following
primers were used for HHV-8 detection: HHV8-1, 50

Results
Table 1 summarizes the IHC and PCR data. LANA
expression by IHC was present in 22 of 24 (92%) of
the Kaposi sarcoma cases, and demonstrated a range
of focal to diffuse, dot-like nuclear staining in
endothelial or spindle cells (Figure 1a and b). No
staining was detected in any of the 13 non-Kaposi
sarcoma cases (Figures 2a, b and 3a, b).
Using real-time PCR, the BCBL-positive control
was detectable at 25.63 cycles-to-threshold.
HHV-8 DNA was detected in all of the Kaposi
sarcoma lesions (Figure 1c), with an average
cycles-to-threshold value of 45.48, and a range of
36.45–49.4. HHV-8 DNA was also detected in four of
13 (31%) of the non-Kaposi sarcoma lesions (Figure
2c), all of which were hemangiomas occurring in

Discussion
Since Kaposi’s seminal description in 1872 of the
tumor bearing his name, the nature and etiology of
Kaposi sarcoma has been the matter of significant
dispute. Formerly a rare tumor, the incidence of
Kaposi sarcoma exploded with the onset of the AIDS
epidemic, and Kaposi sarcoma is now the most
common tumor seen in AIDS patients, with a
disproportionate incidence among homosexual and
bisexual men.10–12 For this reason, an infectious
etiology has long been suspected, and epidemiolo￾gical, serologic, and molecular genetic studies over
the past 10–15 years have identified a novel

herpesvirus, HHV-8, as the likely causative agent of
Kaposi sarcoma.10–14
HHV-8 is known to latently infect endothelial
cells, as well as peripheral blood monocytes and B￾lymphocytes in patients with Kaposi sarcoma.
During latent infection, the virus exists in the
nucleus as circular, episomal DNA that expresses a
small number of viral genes.15 Although no signifi￾cant difference in HHV-8 viral loads has been
observed in biopsies from HIV-positive vs HIV￾negative individuals with Kaposi sarcoma,16 HIV￾infected individuals have a more aggressive course
with frequent dissemination to skin and visceral
organs.
LANA is one of the most highly expressed
proteins during latent HHV-8 infection.17 The LANA
protein is encoded by the open-reading frame 73
(ORF73) of the HHV-8 genome, where it tethers viral
DNA to host heterochromatin and is thereby
required for persistence of viral DNA in dividing
cells.18,19 LANA is also capable of interacting with
pRb, which plays a regulatory role in the beginning
of the S-phase of the cell cycle.20 Additionally,
LANA mimics the E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins of
human papillomavirus in its ability to inhibit the
function of p53.21 LANA has an essential role in
maintenance of the episomal DNA during latent
infection and cell division, and also regulates gene
expression in infected cells.22
A relatively small number of studies have exam￾ined LANA expression by IHC. Using a polyclonal
antisera, Katano et al23 found LANA expression in
100% of Kaposi sarcoma cases studied. Kellam
et al,
6 Dupin et al5 and Courville et al,
24 using the
LNA53 monoclonal antibody, noted LANA expres￾sion in well over 90% of Kaposi sarcoma cases, as
compared with 0% of non-Kaposi sarcoma controls.
Schwartz et al,
7 using the same 13B10 clone utilized
in the present study, noted LANA expression in all
classic and HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma studied
and in 69% of endemic (African) Kaposi sarcoma.
All non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors were
LANA-negative. Most recently, three large studies,
by Cheuk et al,
8 Robin et al9 and Patel et al,
25 have
shown LANA expression in 71 of 72 cases, 50 of 50
cases and 21of 21 of Kaposi sarcoma, respectively, as
compared with 0% of non-Kaposi sarcoma potential
mimics. All of the non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular
tumors in these three studies occurred in HIV￾negative individuals, except for four cases of
bacillary angiomatosis in the study of Cheuk et al;
8
neither study examined HHV-8 positivity by PCR.
The present study detected LANA expression in
92% of Kaposi sarcoma cases, a rate comparable to
that seen in previous results. Our original specula￾tion that a subset of vascular tumors from HIV￾infected patients might express LANA proved not to
be the case; as in the general population, we
observed no LANA expression in any hemangioma
occurring in HIV-positive patients, nor in the one
epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The number of
such cases that we were able to accrue was,
however, relatively small, despite our very extensive
search of the archives of a large county hospital with
a large number of HIV-positive patients. Conceiva￾bly, a study involving a larger number of cases might
conceivably identify rare LANA-positive non-Kapo￾si sarcoma vascular tumors in immunocompromised
patients.
Molecular genetic techniques, such as traditional
gel-based PCR, in situ PCR, and in situ hybridiza￾tion, are more sensitive than LANA IHC, and have
traditionally been accepted as the ‘gold standard’ for
the detection of latent HHV-8 infection. Real-time
PCR, as used in this study, offers several advantages
over conventional PCR. It is a quantitative assay that
generates a signal based on the starting copy number
only if there is amplification of the target sequence.
Real-time PCR has also been shown to have greater
sensitivity than conventional PCR, and is less time￾consuming and cumbersome because it obviates the
need for postamplification gel electrophoresis.26
Our finding of uniform HHV-8 expression in
Kaposi sarcoma, by PCR, is in agreement with
Figure 3 Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (a), negative for
LANA by IHC (b). This case was HHV-8 negative (not shown).

numerous prior studies, all of which have
found 490% of Kaposi sarcoma of all types to be
HHV-8 positive, using both traditional and in situ
PCR.16,27–33 The 100% detection rate we observed
may in part be due to our use of a high cycles-to￾threshold limit of 50. We chose to carry reactions out
to 50 cycles-to-threshold for the purpose of detect￾ing potentially very low viral loads in paraffin￾embedded tissue blocks that had been in storage for
up to 10 years. Although one could argue that this is
the upper limit of sensitivity for the TaqMan
technique, it is our experience that a value over a
fluorescence threshold of 30 is evidence of a true
infection despite a slightly higher cycle limit.
Our finding of HHV-8 positivity in 4 LANA￾negative capillary hemangiomas is intriguing, and
in agreement with a small number of studies which
have documented HHV-8 positivity in occasional
non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors. HHV-8 DNA
sequences have been identified by both PCR and
Southern blot analysis in a subset of angiosarcomas
by both McDonagh et al30 and Gyulai et al,
34 and in a
single case of pyogenic granuloma.29 None of these
cases were reported to have occurred in an im￾munocompromised individual, and none was stu￾died for LANA expression. The great majority of
non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors previously
studied have, however, been negative for HHV-8 by
PCR.16,27–33 Given that the positive cases in the
present study all showed levels above our preset
high threshold level, we believe our results do
indicate the true presence of HHV-8, rather than
representing ‘false positives’. Regrettably, we did
not have access to frozen tissue from these positive
cases, and thus were unable to perform Southern
blot confirmation. There are several possible ex￾planations for our higher rate of detection of HHV-8
DNA in non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular tumors. We
believe the most likely explanation is that the real￾time PCR technique was able to detect HHV-8 within
intratumoral blood mononuclear cells. A certain
subset of these HIV-positive patients were likely to
be coinfected with HHV-8, and probably harbored
latent DNA in blood mononuclear cells. Further, the
endothelial cells in capillary hemangiomas from
these same patients failed to show staining with the
LANA antibody. Although there is a small possibi￾lity that latent DNA is present in endothelial cells at
a level that is undetectable by LANA staining, the
similar PCR cycles-to-threshold values seen in the
Kaposi sarcoma and non-Kaposi sarcoma cases make
this explanation less likely. Lastly, although it is
difficult to exclude completely the possibility of a
‘false positive’ due to amplification of a nonspecific
PCR reaction product, in the absence of Southern
blot confirmation, repeated PCR study of these four
cases showed identical results.
We conclude that the IHC demonstration of LANA
expression is a highly sensitive and specific marker
of Kaposi sarcoma in both the general population, as
shown previously, and in HIV-positive patients.
Given the importance of distinguishing Kaposi
sarcoma from its many potential mimics, it is
noteworthy that no non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular
tumor to date has been reported to express LANA.
This is in stark contrast to both our own and
previous HHV-8 PCR studies, which have documen￾ted HHV-8 positivity in a small but significant
subset of non-Kaposi sarcoma vascular lesions.
These observations have important clinical implica￾tions inasmuch as they support the use of LANA
immunohistochemistry, rather than HHV-8 PCR, as a
histomorphologic adjunct in the evaluation of
problematic vascular proliferations that include
Kaposi sarcoma in the differential diagnosis.
