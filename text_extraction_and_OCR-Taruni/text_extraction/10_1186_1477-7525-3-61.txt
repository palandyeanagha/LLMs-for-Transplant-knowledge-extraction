Abstract
Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating lung disease with a survival of only
three to five years from the time of diagnosis. Due to a paucity of studies, large gaps remain in our
understanding of how IPF affects the quality of patients' lives. In only one other study did
investigators ask patients directly for their perspectives on this topic. Further, currently there is no
disease-specific instrument to measure health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with IPF. A
carefully constructed measurement instrument, sensitive to underlying change, is needed for use in
clinical trials and longitudinal studies of patients with IPF. Before developing such an instrument,
researchers must improve their understanding of the relevant effects of IPF on patients' lives. On
a broader scale, to provide the best care for people with IPF, clinicians must appreciate – from
patients' perspectives – how this disease affects various aspects of their lives.
Methods: We used focus groups and individual in-depth interviews with 20 IPF patients to collect
their perspectives on how IPF affects their lives (with a focus on the quality of their lives). We then
analyzed these perspectives and organized them into a conceptual framework for describing HRQL
in patients with IPF. Next, we examined how well certain existing measurement instruments –
which have been administered to IPF patients in prior studies – covered the domains and topics
our patients identified.
Results: In our framework, we identified 12 primary domains: symptoms, IPF therapy, sleep,
exhaustion, forethought, employment and finances, dependence, family, sexual relations, social
participation, mental and spiritual well-being, mortality. Each domain is composed of several topics,
which describe how IPF affects patients' lives. When we compared the content of our conceptual
framework with the existing instruments, we found the coverage of the existing instruments to be
inadequate for several reasons, including they may tap general areas of QOL or HRQL but not
some areas that appear to be most directly affected by IPF, and they include items that are relevant
to symptoms and effects of other respiratory diseases but not IPF.

Conclusion: Collecting patients' perspectives and developing an organized inventory of the
relevant effects of IPF on patients' lives provides valuable information for improving our
understanding of the impact of this disease on patients and their loved ones. We believe our
findings will help alert clinicians and researchers to IPF patients' experiences and concerns. Based
on the comparison or our conceptual framework with the content of four existing instruments, it
would appear that developing an IPF-specific measurement instrument is justified. Our conceptual
framework for describing health-related quality of life in patients with IPF lays a solid foundation
for constructing such an instrument.
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common
of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. It is thought to
affect about 30 persons per 100,000 people in the general
population and perhaps as many as 175 per 100,000 peo￾ple 75 years and older [1,2]. Breathlessness and irritating
dry cough, often refractory to anti-tussive therapy, are
classic symptoms. The disease course of IPF is somewhat
variable, but patients commonly suffer progressive
decline in lung function that culminates in respiratory
failure and death. Median survival ranges from three to
five years from the time of diagnosis [3-5]. Conventional
IPF pharmacotherapy, which includes corticosteroids
(i.e., prednisone) in combination with an immunosup￾pressive agent (e.g., azathioprine or cyclophosphamide),
is largely ineffective, fraught with adverse effects, and
often requires frequent laboratory monitoring [6].
The definition for quality of life (QOL) that we use in this
manuscript refers to an individual's "holistic" evaluation
of satisfaction with his own life [7]. Health-related quality
of life (HRQL) incorporates the subjectively perceived
impact of one's health – including aspects of well-being
(or lack thereof) in the physical, mental, emotional,
social, and spiritual facets of life – on life domains of per￾ceived importance. Currently, there is no instrument that
is claimed to be appropriate for evaluating HRQL specifi￾cally in patients with IPF. A handful of studies [8-13],
using existing generic or non-IPF respiratory-specific
measurement instruments, have assessed QOL or HRQL
in patients with IPF, but none of these instruments have
been shown to be sensitive to disease progression or to
treatment effects (although detecting the latter presup￾poses the existence of effective treatment, which unfortu￾nately is not currently available in the case of IPF). The
generic measurement instruments that have been used
with IPF patients include the World Health Organization
100-Item Instrument (WHOQOL-100) [14], the Quality
of Well-Being Scale (QWB) [15], and the Medical Out￾comes Study Short-Form 36-Item Instrument (SF-36) [16]
– none of which were specifically designed for patients
with devastating illnesses like IPF. Further, in a cross-sec￾tional study of 50 patients with various interstitial lung
diseases, including 33 with IPF, Chang and her colleagues
[8] found that the QWB's content and scaling made it
incapable of distinguishing patients with varying degrees
of IPF severity.
The respiratory-specific measures administered to IPF
patients in prior studies included the Chronic Respiratory
Questionnaire (CRQ) [17] and St. George's Respiratory
Questionnaire (SGRQ) [18] – both of which were
designed specifically for patients with obstructive lung
diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphy￾sema) [8-13]. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lies within a
completely different spectrum of diseases from these; its
physiologic hallmark is ventilatory restriction, not
obstruction. The symptoms of IPF are different from the
symptoms of obstructive diseases, which cause wheezing,
productive cough, and attacks of disease activity: IPF does
not cause wheezing, its cough is typically not productive,
and IPF symptoms are not episodic. In the same study
mentioned above, Chang and her co-investigators [8]
noted that the original form of the CRQ underestimated
the negative impact of breathlessness on their IPF
patients' quality of life because that instrument allowed
patients to rate their dyspnea during self-identified activi￾ties. Patients whose activity level had become increasingly
restricted were rating their breathlessness while perform￾ing less taxing activities; hence, the true impact of breath￾lessness was not reflected in their scores.
In only one study, which enrolled ten patients, did inves￾tigators directly ask patients for their perspectives on how
IPF impacted their lives [11]. However, the ultimate aim
of that study was to assess the relevance of two measure￾ment instruments for patients with IPF. The investigators
did not intend to inventory the myriad effects of IPF on
the quality of patients' lives or to develop a conceptual
framework for describing quality of life in patients with
IPF. Such objectives require study in a more systematic
manner and on a somewhat larger scale. Further, addi￾tional study is required to properly assess the adequacy of
current instruments for evaluating patients with IPF, and,
if the instruments are found to be inadequate, to provide
a basis for developing a more appropriate instrument to
serve this purpose.

We conducted the present study to achieve four objectives:
1) to gain further insight into the effects of IPF on patients'
lives – from their own perspectives, 2) to organize those
effects into a structured conceptual framework, 3) to
examine whether four existing instruments adequately
cover the elements of this framework, and 4) to examine
the extent to which the four existing instruments include
items that may be irrelevant to patients with IPF – or that
may not serve well the purpose of evaluating the impact
of IPF progression and the effects of disease treatment on
IPF patients' quality of life.
Methods
We recruited from the general pulmonary and Interstitial
Lung Disease Clinics at Stanford University patients with
IPF and invited them to participate in focus group meet￾ings or individual in-depth interviews to discuss how IPF
affects their lives. Such qualitative data are often collected
using multiple methods, including focus groups, key
informant interviews, expert opinion, and clinical obser￾vation. To improve data capture, we decided to collect
patients' perspectives using two formats – focus groups
and interviews. An interview accommodates those
patients who are unwilling or unable to participate in a
focus group. For example, in some cases, patients are will￾ing to freely share information in an individual interview
that they might not share in a group setting, while a focus
group allows participants to react and respond to the
other members and to build on ideas raised during the
session. We selected a heterogeneous sample to capture
the views of patients in each stage of disease and with var￾ying times since diagnosis. To identify the number of
patients to enroll in the study, we used the process of
"sampling to redundancy"; in other words, we conducted
interviews and focus groups with different patients until
no new themes or effects emerged [19]. We ended up with
20 patients in our sample. For each participant, the diag￾nosis of IPF was confirmed using currently accepted crite￾ria [1]. Patients with other causes of lung fibrosis were not
eligible.
To ensure that we addressed all major categories (dimen￾sions) of general quality of life, two investigators (JS and
SW) developed a brief set of questions, based loosely on
Flanagan's Quality of Life Scale, which were used in the
focus groups and interviews [20]. One (JS) or two (JS and
SW) investigators took notes and moderated the focus
groups and interviews, which were conducted between
September 2003 and February 2004. Each of the three
focus groups lasted approximately two hours. Each of the
five individual interviews lasted approximately one hour.
Groups and interviews were audio-taped and transcribed.
The study protocol was approved by the Stanford Univer￾sity Institutional Review Board, and all the participants
provided informed, written consent prior to enrollment.
Analysis
In the first step of the analysis, we divided the transcripts
into individual text units, defined as identifiable segments
of continuous speech, ranging in size from phrases to
entire paragraphs that identified some effect of IPF on an
individual's life. Using NVivo qualitative analysis software
(QSR International Pty. Ltd.), we formed sub-categories
by clustering identical text units, or ones that addressed
essentially the same concept. We then grouped similar
sub-categories to form primary conceptual categories
(domains of IPF-related quality of life). Thus, the
domains include sub-categories that are all distinct from
each other and that are comprehensive of all the unique
effects mentioned by patients in the groups and
interviews.
We then compared the topics and specific item content of
the WHOQOL-100, SF-36, CRQ, and SGRQ (measure￾ment instruments administered to IPF patients in previ￾ous studies) with the domains that we identified in our
analysis. In this process, we examined how well these
instruments reflected the identified effects of IPF on
patients' lives and whether they contained items that were
– based on our patients' perceptions – either not relevant
or of questionable utility for assessing change due to dis￾ease progression or in response to therapy for IPF.
Results
Demographic data and selected clinical characteristics of
the participants are presented in Table 1. Our sample con￾sisted of 13 men than 7 women. Most patients had their
diagnoses confirmed by surgical lung biopsy, and all but
one patient was taking at least one medication specifically
for IPF.

Our analysis produced a conceptual framework consisting
of 12 domains. The definitions of these domains are pre￾sented in Table 2, and a narrative summary of some of the
qualitative data substantiating each domain is provided in
this section.
Symptoms
Not surprisingly, symptoms (shortness of breath and
cough) were mentioned as significant impairments to
overall quality of life. Patients in the earlier stages of the
disease were less breathless than those in the later stages.
The latter patients noted that shortness of breath was
extremely distressing, curtailed all physical activity, and
made "even brushing my teeth an exertion". Participants
performed physical activity of any kind less often and less
intensely because of breathlessness. They noted having to
"pause for at least five minutes just to catch my breath"
while performing even simple tasks. They were breathless
"carrying groceries...carrying anything", taking a shower,
bending at the waist, and stooping. Cough was also very
bothersome. It was frequently described as "dry and non￾productive" or "hacking" and "occurring when I talk for
long periods". Several participants mentioned having "a
nagging desire to cough constantly" and "never feeling
relieved after coughing".
IPF Therapy
Because of the extremely low likelihood of a sustained
beneficial response, and because of the high rates of both￾ersome side effects, most patients perceived conventional
IPF therapies as being difficult to tolerate and, in many
ways, "worse than the disease itself". Those patients who
stopped taking certain conventional therapies were "glad
to get rid of [those] medications". Nearly every participant
voiced a willingness to be a "medical guinea pig" by tak￾ing novel experimental therapies for IPF. Patients who
used supplemental oxygen felt "tied to the hoses" that
supplied it. Having to fill their car trunks with oxygen
tanks and experiencing various types of distress due to this
visible indicator of their disability limited their willing￾ness and ability to leave their homes, to participate in
social activities, or travel.
Sleep
Perceptions of how IPF impacted sleep ranged from no
effect to nightly disturbance. Participants reported occa￾sionally being entirely unable to fall asleep at night or
being awoken in the middle of the night because of their
cough.
Exhaustion
Participants experienced low energy and feelings of
exhaustion, which were distinct from the sensation of
breathlessness. Exhaustion and "overwhelming fatigue"
were very prominent and "as bothersome as breathless￾ness". Many noted a "consistent lack of energy", an ongo￾ing "gradual decline in energy", and a need to "economize
energy" during the day. Because of low energy, they "rest
up, do part of the chore, and rest up again" to accomplish
many of the things they want or need to do. Several
patients mentioned feeling "completely wiped out" at the
end of a normal day. Many mentioned that even their cre￾ative energy was low.

Forethought
Participants described a need to "analyze every activity"
before starting it and noted that IPF forced them to plan
every activity throughout the day. They pored over excur￾sions away from home: "Does this restaurant have a ramp
[making pulling an oxygen tank easier]?", "How far away
is the parking lot from the door?". They mapped out their
routes through the grocery store to get needed items with￾out unnecessary exertion. One woman described making
"dry runs" – scouting out the driving distance, parking
lots, and entrances to buildings – a day prior to her
engagements.
Employment and finances
In terms of their occupations or jobs, participants fell into
three categories. They either: (1) had already retired prior
to being diagnosed with IPF, (2) could not retire because
their medical costs were so great, or (3) were disabled or
lost [their] job/career because of IPF. Some of the patients
who were still working felt the need to conceal their
chronic illness from business colleagues, because the
patients believed it made them "appear weak." One man
summed up many of the patients' fears about financial
insecurity by saying that "in terms of using up my
finances, continuing living is a real concern of mine." In
general, participants did not want to exhaust family sav￾ings on their medical care.
Dependence
The near certainty of disease progression made partici￾pants sad and fearful, especially of "becoming more
dependent on loved ones". Most said that "the least satis￾fying aspect of my life is not being as independent as I
once was", and many noted that having IPF caused them
a "loss of privacy" due to the need for assistance. Having
someone else assist with bathing was incredibly worri￾some for them. All of them (young and old) relied on
someone or something just to "get by" (e.g., hand-rails in
the shower, raised toilet seats). They were very frustrated
by this and even more so by the likelihood that they will
"become a physical or financial burden to family
members".
Family
Most participants mentioned an increased appreciation
for the relationships they had with family members and
the love and support that family members gave them
throughout the course of their disease. Many said that the
most satisfying part of their current lives was family.
Some, however, mentioned that IPF strained their rela￾tionship with their spouse or significant loved ones. The
limitations that IPF imposed caused many couples to
completely change and rearrange their lifestyles; this was
extremely frustrating, saddening, and stress-inducing.
Many participants also found positive aspects of having
IPF, including that it gave them the motivation and
opportunity to spend more quality time with their family
members.
Sexual relations
Patients experienced decreased libido and a substantial
curtailment of sexual activity, mostly due to diminished
physical stamina. Several mentioned that their sexual
partners were hesitant to engage in sexual activity or
refrained from sexual activity altogether because of con￾cerns about the patient over-exerting him- or herself.
Many mentioned feeling less sexually attractive or desira￾ble because of having IPF; this was a particularly common
concern of patients using supplemental oxygen.
Social participation
Most participants curtailed their social participation in
engagements involving crowds of people for fear of
"catching something [a respiratory illness that might lead
to their demise]". Most patients went out to eat, to the
theater, or to other social events much less frequently than
before being diagnosed with IPF. Those in the later stages
of the disease stayed in their homes almost exclusively.
Many patients felt the need to try to hide the fact that they
had a chronic illness when they were in public. The sub￾jects were generally "more discriminating" with how they
spent their time. This often translated into having diffi￾culty "keeping up with certain relationships." Several
patients felt like friends could not understand all that liv￾ing with IPF entails. For nearly every patient (including
those not yet needing supplemental oxygen), travel was
considered extremely burdensome or, quite reluctantly,
abandoned altogether.
Mental and spiritual well-being
Several participants mentioned feeling sad, mainly in
"anticipation of a decline in function". They commonly
reported fear, worry, anxiety and panic and related these
emotions to having IPF. IPF had the effect of "turning life
upside-down" and causing them to "readjust life goals"
and "refocus their lives". Many mentioned that IPF had
become the "focal point" of their lives (and their spouses'
and family members' lives as well). Some had difficulty
with activities that required cognition or concentration.
The effect of IPF on participants' spiritual well-being was
generally positive; many of them became more contem￾plative, reflective, and had a stronger sense of their spirit￾ual selves.
Mortality
Not surprisingly, given the grave prognosis of IPF, the dis￾ease forced patients to "face reality", "recognize their mor￾tality", and realize that " [they are] on the course of
expiration". Participants yearned for more attention to
end-of-life issues from the medical community. In gen-

eral, they felt insecure about the dying process, afraid their
symptoms would not be controlled toward the end of
their lives and that the experience of death would be that
of conscious suffocation. However, more than the dying
process itself, many patients feared that they would be liv￾ing a "worthless existence" toward the end of their lives.
Many voiced concerns that they had several things that
they wanted to do before dying. They wanted to get their
"affairs in order" and most had "many preparations" to
make in this regard.
Comparison of the identified effects of IPF on quality of 
life with the content of existing instruments
Table 3 shows the numbers of items on each of the two
non-IPF respiratory-specific measurement instruments
(the CRQ-SAS and SGRQ) and the two generic instru￾ments (the SF-36 and WHOQOL-100) which relate, in
any way, to the domains that our participants identified as
relevant to patients with IPF. The CRQ-SAS and SF-36
appear to have very limited coverage of the domains rele￾vant to patients with IPF. Neither have items that focus on
therapy, sleep, forethought, employment and finances,
dependence, sexual relations, or mortality. Both of these
instruments have items that address symptoms; however
the scope of the CRQ-SAS is limited to assessing how
breathless a respondent becomes while performing cer￾tain activities, and only one item on this instrument men￾tions cough. Certain items on the SF-36 ask about how
physical health affects activities; however, there are no
items that mention breathlessness or cough, which would
make it impossible to differentiate their individual effects.
Pain, which is also a domain on the SF-36, was not men￾tioned as part of our patients' disease experience. The
wording of some items in the symptom domain of the
SGRQ makes them irrelevant to patients with IPF; for
example, they mention "wheezing", "attacks of chest trou￾ble", or "chest condition" – effects and descriptions not
identified by our participants. In addition, the SGRQ has
no items that address sleep, dependence, family, sexual
relations, or mortality. Patients in the current study iden￾tified multiple effects of IPF that were not covered at all on
the WHOQOL-100, including several effects in our symp￾toms, therapy, forethought, dependence, and mortality
domains.
Discussion
In this study, we identified specific effects of IPF on
patients' quality of life, by using patients' own perspec￾tives. We grouped these specific effects into 12 conceptual
categories, which compose both our conceptual frame￾work of HRQL in IPF and might constitute provisional
domains for a disease-specific measure. By eliciting
patients' perspectives, we also have identified the reasons
why existing generic and non-IPF respiratory disease-spe￾cific instruments are less than ideal for measuring QOL or
HRQL in patients with IPF. An appropriate instrument
must include items relevant to IPF patients and must tap

important IPF-specific effects that are not captured well
(or, in some cases, at all) by existing instruments.
According to patients, IPF significantly impairs quality of
life. Symptoms of breathlessness and cough are extremely
bothersome and limit physical activity, social participa￾tion, travel, and sexual relations. Fatigue, or more pre￾cisely, exhaustion is another effect of IPF that patients
mention as occurring frequently and negatively impacting
their lives. Interestingly, our patients were careful to make
the distinction between breathlessness and low energy or
exhaustion; they perceived the difference between the two
quite clearly.
Most of our patients had to rearrange their lives quite
extensively because of the effects of IPF. They had to take
more time to prepare for the day, they used a lot of mental
energy examining tasks to determine if they could com￾plete them, and they were fearful of the impending need
to depend on other people. Like many other patients with
chronic or life-threatening illnesses, our patients took
great comfort in realizing the love and support of their
family members. While many patients recognized this
positive aspect that living with IPF had on their relation￾ships with their spouses and family members, several
patients mentioned how the effects of this disease caused
a great deal of tension between them and their loved ones.
Not surprisingly, patients said they sometimes felt like a
burden to other people, or they felt lazy because they were
unable to do certain things (e.g., chores around the
house).
Living with IPF also made patients reflect on their lives
and their emotional selves. They were forced to think
about things that they didn't necessarily want to think
about (e.g., their own mortality and the effects that would
have on loved ones left behind). Regarding death, patients
wanted assurance that their symptoms would be control￾led, that their passing would be peaceful, and that the
dying process would occur on their own terms.
In the only study, other than the present one, that directly
assessed IPF patients' perspectives, De Vries and col￾leagues [11] conducted three focus groups with a total of
10 IPF patients to assess the disease's impact on patient
quality of life and to discuss the SGRQ and the WHO￾QOL-100. Their patients emphasized the physical limita￾tions imposed by IPF and viewed the fatigue and social
isolation caused by IPF as "serious problems". Other gen￾eral areas perceived to be negatively affected by IPF
included mobility, leisure activities, social relations, and
working capacity – all areas included within the domains
we have identified. Many of the basic findings of De
Vries's and our study are consistent. However, perhaps
because of the larger number of patients in the present
study, or perhaps because of the somewhat more system￾atic and detailed analyses that we used, we identified addi￾tional effects of IPF that were not previously reported.
Both De Vries's patients and (by inference) ours felt that
the SGRQ did not adequately capture their disease
experience, and the reasons are apparent when one inven￾tories the SGRQ items in comparison with the effects we
identified – as we have presented in Table 3.
In their study, De Vries and colleagues concluded that the
WHOQOL-100 was well-suited to measuring QOL in
patients with IPF, and that development of a disease-spe￾cific instrument for IPF was unnecessary [11]. We would
agree that the WHOQOL-100 provides a useful
measurement tool for many purposes, particularly if one
is interested in comparisons across healthy populations or
in those with a variety of health problems, rather than
comparisons within a specific disease population. How￾ever, if the purpose is to measure changes in quality of life
that may be associated with different stages of IPF, or that
may be associated with different treatments of IPF, we
would argue that because it is a generic instrument, the
WHOQOL-100 is likely to have limited value. In fact, IPF
patients in the study by De Vries and colleagues suggested
that the WHOQOL-100 did not place sufficient emphasis
on breathlessness, depression and social relationships. In
addition, while the investigators stated that the WHO￾QOL-100 includes every general aspect of life that their
patients mentioned, they did not detail the number of
items that their patients found completely irrelevant nor
how well patients believed that the purportedly relevant
items captured their IPF-related circumstances.
To be useful and valid for a particular purpose in a given
population, an instrument must not only tap relevant
domains; even more importantly, the domains must be
represented by relevant items that are in the correct range
to adequately assess the population under study, and the
instrument must possess the psychometric properties that
substantiate its use in that population. There is no evi￾dence to date that the WHOQOL-100 possesses the requi￾site sensitivity among IPF patients. That reason alone
would render premature the conclusion that the WHO￾QOL-100 is adequate for studies in this population.
We would argue further that there is little reason for con￾fidence that any of the existing measurement instruments
that have been used in patients with IPF would be suffi￾ciently sensitive for the purposes we are interested in – or
that they would be more sensitive than an instrument spe￾cifically designed to address the concerns of patients with
IPF. The instruments that we examined in this study focus
on some aspects of disease that are not relevant to patients
with IPF, they define or operationalize important
domains in ways that make them less relevant for IPF,

they miss potentially important domains altogether, their
scales may be out of the range necessary to reflect the
experiences of patients with IPF, and the steps between
response options may be too great to capture important
differences among IPF patients – or within the same IPF
patient over time. All of these features tend to detract from
the face validity of these instruments for IPF patients. If
these instruments were used to evaluate IPF patients over
time, their inclusion of items that cover less relevant top￾ics may introduce variance into patients' scores that would
tend to obscure, rather than reveal, changes in quality of
life specifically associated with IPF or its therapy. Further,
their omission of items on more relevant dimensions
means that these instruments would not be able to reflect
changes on those aspects at all.
While our study enrolled only 20 patients from one
center, our sample included patients of varying age, with
a broad range of disease duration, and representing the
full spectrum of IPF disease. Some patients were diag￾nosed a short time before their focus group or interview,
others were listed for lung transplantation at the time of
the study, and some were in hospice care. While no study
is absolutely free of bias, we attempted to minimize it by
allowing the themes and items to emerge from the data.
Conclusion
In this study, we conducted focus groups and in-depth
interviews with a heterogeneous sample of IPF patients to
identify specific effects of IPF on patients' lives. We used
these patients' perspectives to develop a comprehensive
conceptual framework for describing HRQL in this popu￾lation. We identified 12 primary domains and numerous
sub-categories and specific effects of IPF on the quality of
patients' lives. We then examined how well four existing
instruments covered these identified topics and found
that there were several gaps and insufficiencies in these
instruments' abilities to capture the effects of IPF on the
quality of patients' lives. We suggest that a more appropri￾ate instrument to measure HRQL in patients with IPF is
needed and would be of great value.
