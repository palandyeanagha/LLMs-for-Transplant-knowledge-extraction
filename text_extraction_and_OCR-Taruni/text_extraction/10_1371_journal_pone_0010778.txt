Abstract
The role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has been extensively characterized in the aetiology of sarcopenia
(aging-associated loss of muscle mass) and muscle wasting as a result of muscle disuse. What remains less clear is whether
the decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity is purely a function of the aging process or if the sedentary
lifestyle of older adult subjects has confounded previous reports. The objective of the present study was to investigate if a
recreationally active lifestyle in older adults can conserve skeletal muscle strength and functionality, chronic systemic
inflammation, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity, and cellular antioxidant capacity. To that end, muscle
biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis of young and age-matched recreationally active older and sedentary older men
and women (N = 10/group; R = =). We show that a physically active lifestyle is associated with the partial compensatory
preservation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and cellular oxidative and antioxidant capacity in skeletal muscle of older adults.
Conversely a sedentary lifestyle, associated with osteoarthritis-mediated physical inactivity, is associated with reduced
mitochondrial function, dysregulation of cellular redox status and chronic systemic inflammation that renders the skeletal
muscle intracellular environment prone to reactive oxygen species-mediated toxicity. We propose that an active lifestyle is
an important determinant of quality of life and molecular progression of aging in skeletal muscle of the elderly, and is a
viable therapy for attenuating and/or reversing skeletal muscle strength declines and mitochondrial abnormalities
associated with aging.

Introduction
Individuals over the age of 69 y represent one of the fastest
growing segments of the North American population [1].
Although an important public health outcome continues to be
an increase in life expectancy, of even greater importance is that
extended life span is accompanied by an improved capacity to
function independently and a better quality of life. Aging is a
multidimensional process that is influenced by genetic polymor￾phisms, nutrition, lifestyle and overall health status [2,3]. One of
the most striking and debilitating age-associated alterations is the
progressive loss of fat-free skeletal muscle mass, a phenomenon
known as sarcopenia [4–7]. This loss of muscle mass and strength,
and the increase in body fat with aging are physiological
phenomena that occur in part as a consequence of metabolic
changes associated with a sedentary lifestyle in older adults [8,9]. A
chronic sedentary lifestyle can lead to ‘‘frailty,’’ a multidimensional
geriatric syndrome of decreased resistance to stressors resulting in
cumulative systemic declines [10–13]. Clinical trials have shown
that sedentary older adults significantly improved their physical
performance and health following a physical activity intervention
[14,15]. Longitudinal studies have shown that regular physical
activity may extend life expectancy, reduce morbidity (cancer,
neurological disease, etc.), and reduce physical disability in later
life [2,3,16–19]. These findings suggest that preserving mobility
and an active lifestyle is essential in maintaining a high quality of
life in older adults.
The role of mitochondrial abnormalities and oxidative stress in
the etiology of sarcopenia has been extensively characterized [20–
27]. The ‘‘mitochondrial theory of aging’’ stipulates that the aging
process is modulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated
toxicity leading to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and
mutations, macromolecular oxidation, electron transport chain
(ETC) dysfunction, cellular senescence and cell death [28–30].
Muscle from older adults show: (1) an increase in mitochondrial
ETC abnormalities marked by the accumulation of cytochrome c
oxidase negative and succinate dehydrogenase hyper-positive
fibres, (2) an increase in markers of oxidative stress, (3)
accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations, and (4) a transcrip￾tome ‘‘signature’’ indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction
[21,22,31–33]. Despite a strong relationship between aging and
oxidative damage, the literature on the effect of aging on skeletal
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10778

muscle ETC function remains equivocal in humans. Many studies
have demonstrated a significant age-related reduction of mito￾chondrial ETC complex enzymes in human skeletal muscle
[34–37], while others have not observed such changes [33,38–41].
Barrientos and colleagues (1996) suggested that the reported age￾related reduction in ETC function (reduced mitochondrial
complex I, II, III, and IV activity) is not related to the aging
process per se, but rather due to other confounding factors,
including physical inactivity [38]. Our group has also reported
normal mitochondrial ETC function in the skeletal muscle of
recreationally active elderly individuals (7262 y) despite an
increase in markers of oxidative damage (e.g., protein carbonyls
and 8-hydroxy 2-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]) vs. healthy young
individuals (2263 y) [33]. Hence, the relationship between
mitochondrial ETC dysfunction, oxidative stress and sarcopenia
remain an important and unresolved issue in aging research that is
likely influenced by physical activity status.
The principal aim of this study was to investigate the equivocal
findings regarding mitochondrial oxidative capacity in human
skeletal muscle aging using two age-matched older adult
populations, a recreationally active old (AO) and sedentary frail
old (SO), who differed primarily in their physical activity status. In
addition, we also delineated if a physically active lifestyle can: (1)
attenuate the loss of skeletal muscle strength and functional
capacity, (2) reduce systemic inflammation, (3) conserve mito￾chondrial biogenesis and complex IV activity (indicative of
mitochondrial oxidative capacity), and (4) maintains cellular redox
status via maintenance of mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide
dismutase (first line of defence against ROS). We hypothesized
that the skeletal muscle strength, systemic inflammation, mito￾chondrial oxidative capacity, and antioxidant response would be
relatively better preserved in the physically active, but not
sedentary frail, elderly vs. the young.
Methods
Study Participants and Experimental Protocol
We recruited recreationally active university young students,
recreationally active old (AO), and sedentary old (SO) men and
women from Hamilton area for this cross-sectional study (Table 1).
Both young and active old subjects carried out activities of daily
living (walking, grocery shopping, gardening, etc.) and participated
in modest recreational activities (golfing, gardening, tennis and/or
cycling) three or more times a week but were not competitive
athletes, and were healthy. Consequently, the young and AO
subjects had similar volumes and intensities of physical activity.
The SO subjects were patients with a primary diagnosis of knee
joint osteoarthritis that rendered them with a sedentary lifestyle,
but were otherwise fairly healthy. The SO subjects were recruited
through the total knee-joint arthroplasty program at the Hamilton
Health Sciences Corporation. The inclusion criteria for the SO
group included: evidence of severe knee joint osteoarthritis by
radiography, age 50–75 y, and no previous joint arthroplasty in
the knee to be operated upon (and biopsied, see below). The
exclusion criteria for all subject groups in the study included:
evidence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, renal
failure (creatinine .120 mmol/L; potassium .5.00 mmol/L),
diabetes requiring insulin or a glyburide dosage of 5 mg or more,
previous stroke with motor loss, rheumatoid or other known
inflammatory arthritis, uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension
requiring more than monopharmacotherapy, inability to give
consent because of cognitive difficulties, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (forced vital capacity or forced expiratory
volume in 1 second ,85% of age-predicted mean value, or
requiring any medication other than an inhaler as needed), and
smoking. The elderly women (both AO and SO) were post￾menopausal and were not taking hormone replacement therapy,
and the young women were not taking oral contraceptives. All
subjects provided written consent prior to their participation. The
study was approved by the Hamilton Health Sciences Human
Research Ethics Board and conformed to the guidelines outlined
in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Body Composition and Strength Testing
We measured total body weight and height of the subjects to the
nearest 0.1 kg and 0.5 cm, respectively, using a calibrated
electronic scale (Health-O-Meter Pro Series Electronic Scale,
Bridgeview, IL). We also assessed body composition was using
bioelectric impedance (RJL Systems, Clinton Twp, MI) and
maximal isometric torque of subject’s right leg using a dynamom￾eter (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) as
previously described by our group [42,43]. For body composition
assessment of SO subjects, the electrodes were placed on the non￾arthroplasty leg and the ipsilateral arm. To determine maximal
isometric contraction, subjects were positioned into the machine
with the knee flexed at 90u and performed three maximal 5-second
voluntary contractions with 30-second rest between each trial.
Functional Testing
We assessed functional capacity of elderly subjects (AO and
SO), as an indirect marker of their cardiovascular fitness and
hence physical activity status, via a timed stair-climb test and a
walk test using a stopwatch that recorded times to an accuracy of
1/100 of a second. The 30-feet walk test comprised of subjects
walking as fast and safely as possible for a 30-feet distance that was
marked off with clear start and stop points. The stair-climb test
included subjects climbing four stairs, starting with both feet on the
bottom platform and ascending one step at a time, using a
handrail only if insecure.
Muscle Biopsy
All subjects were instructed to abstain from physical activity for
48-h prior to the muscle biopsy. Young and AO subjects arrived at
McMaster University Hospital (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada)
between 0800 h and 0930 h in the post-absorptive state following
an overnight fast. We collected a muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis
of the dominant leg, 10 cm proximal or distal to the knee joint

using a modified Bergstro¨m needle (5 mm diameter) with suction
modification [44]. After quickly dissecting the biopsied muscle
tissue of fat and connective tissue, we placed ,100 mg of wet
muscle in RNase-free cryoviles, immediately snap froze it in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 286uC until analysis. SO subjects were
biopsied from the vastus lateralis at the time of their total knee joint
arthroplasty procedure at McMaster University Hospital (Hamil￾ton, Ontario, Canada) immediately after the first incision and
without vascular occlusion, 10 min after induction. Biopsies from
SO subjects were collected by a single surgeon and the wet muscle
tissue was stored as aforementioned.
Skeletal Muscle Tissue Homogenization
The total protein was extracted from the frozen skeletal muscle
samples as described previously in detail by our group [45].
Briefly, ,30 mg of skeletal muscle was homogenized on ice in a
2 mL Wheaton glass homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON)
with 25 volumes of phosphate homogenization buffer [50 mM
KH2PO4, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 1.15% KCl] supple￾mented with a Complete Mini, ETDA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail tablet and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Phos￾STOP, Roche Applied Science, Mannhein, Germany) per 10 mL
of buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 600 g for 15 min at 4uC to
pellet cellular debris. The supernatant was aliquoted, snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at 286uC until further analysis. The
Lowry assay was used to quantify the total protein content of
samples.
Marker of Systemic Inflammation
Muscle lysates were also analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP;
Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) content using
an enzyme immunoassay, as per manufacturer instructions. All
samples, standards, and controls were run in duplicate and results
were expressed as ngN
mg protein21 for CRP.
Immunoblotting
Proteins were resolved on 7.5, 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels
depending on the molecular weight of the protein of interest. The
gels were transferred onto HybondH ECL nitrocellulose mem￾branes (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ), and immunoblotted using the
following commercially available primary antibodies: anti-COX
subunit I (cytochrome c oxidase - subunit I; MS404), anti-COX
subunit II (cytochrome c oxidase - subunit II; MS405) and anti￾COX subunit IV (cytochrome c oxidase - subunit IV; MS408,
MitoSciences, Eugene, OR); anti-Cu/Zn-SOD (copper/zinc
superoxide dismutase; ab16831), anti-Mn-SOD (manganese
superoxide dismutase; ab13533) and anti-nNOS (neuronal nitric
oxide synthase; ab63602, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); anti-PGC-1a
(2178, Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, MA). The anti-CS
(citrate synthase) antibody was a generous gift by Dr. Brian
Robinson (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON). Anti￾actin (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) was used as a house￾keeping loading control and to normalize the expression of
proteins of interest. All antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution,
except for anti-COX subunit II (1:4000 dilution), anti-CS (1:2000
dilution) and anti-actin (1:10,000 dilution). Membranes were then
incubated with the appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (de￾pending on the primary antibody source) horse radish peroxidase￾linked secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) and visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ). Relative intensities of the protein bands were
digitally quantified by using NIH ImageJ, version 1.37, analysis
software (Scion Image, NIH).
Citrate Synthase and Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity
Citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1) activity was determined by
measuring the formation of thionitrobenzoate anion, as previously
described by our group [33]. Briefly, 15 mL of muscle homogenate
was added to 810 mL buffer (0.1M Tris–HCl buffer, pH 8.0) along
with 10 mL of acetyl CoA (7.5 mM in 0.1M Tris-HCL buffer,
pH 8.0) and 100 mL of 0.1 mM dithionitrobenzoic acid. The
reaction was started by adding 50 mL of 9.0 mM oxaloacetate.
Absorbance was recorded at 412 nm every 30 s for 3 min at 37uC.
CS activity was expressed in nmol.min21
.mg of protein21
.
Mitochondrial electron transport chain cytochrome c oxidase
(COX; EC 1.9.3.1) activity (indicative of mitochondrial oxidative
capacity) was determined by measuring the rate of oxidation of
reduced cytochrome c, as previously described by our group [33].
Briefly, stock cytochrome c (oxidized) was reduced by sodium
ascorbate in 0.05 mM potassium phosphate buffer (KH2PO4,
pH 7.4). Fifteen microliters of muscle homogenate were added to
955 ml of 0.05 mM potassium phosphate buffer, and 15 mL of
reduced cytochrome c. Absorbance was recorded at 550 nm every
30 s for 3 min at 37uC. All samples were analyzed in duplicate on a
spectrophotometer (Cary Bio-300, Varion, Inc., Palo Alto, CA).
The intra-assay coefficient of variation for all samples was less
than 4%.
Antioxidant Enzyme Activity
Muscle total superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD and Cu/Zn￾SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) activity was determined in muscle lysate by
measuring the kinetic consumption of superoxide radical (O2
-
) by
SOD in a competitive reaction with cytochrome c, as previously
described by our group [33]. Absorption was recorded at 550 nm
and was observed every 15 s for 2 min at 37uC. One unit (U) of
SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that caused a
50% inhibition of the reduction of cytochrome c. Total SOD
activity was expressed in UN
mg of protein21
. In a separate cuvette,
the same sample was analyzed under identical conditions in the
presence of 0.2 M KCN (pH 8.5–9.5), a potent inhibitor of
cytosolic Cu/Zn-SOD [46], for determination of mitochondrial
Mn-SOD activity. Cu/Zn-SOD activity was approximated by
subtracting Mn-SOD activity from total SOD activity. Both Mn￾SOD and Cu/Zn-SOD activity were expressed in UN
mg
protein21
. All samples were analyzed in duplicate on a
spectrophotometer.
Mn-SOD Immunoprecipitation and Nitration Analyses
Muscle lysate (100 mg) was pre-cleared in 25% v/v pre-clearing
matrix F (sc-45057; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
overnight at 4uC. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 mg
of polyclonal anti-Mn-SOD antibody (ab13533; Abcam, Cam￾bridge, MA) and ExactaCruzTM F matrix (sc-45043; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) complex with mixing by end￾over-end inversion overnight at 4uC. The matrix was centrifuged
at 16,000 g for 30 sec, and the pellet matrix-immune complex
precipitate was washed with 500 mL of PBS buffer (5 times). The
washed matrix-immune complex was re-suspended in Laemmli
sample buffer supplemented with 5% b-mercaptoethanol, and
heated at 95uC for 5 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 g for 1
min, samples were immediately loaded and resolved on reducing
12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. The nitrocellulose membranes were
blotted for Mn-SOD to confirm immunoprecipitation. Repeat
addition of anti-Mn-SOD antibody - ExactaCruzTM F matrix
showed no further immunoprecipitated protein, indicating that the
procedure is quantitative. To quantify Mn-SOD nitration, Mn￾SOD immune complex were resolved on reducing 12.5% SDS￾PAGE gels, followed by immunoblotting with primary anti￾Sedentary Aging & Mitochondria

nitrotyrosine polyclonal antibody (06-284, 1:1000 dilution; Milli￾poreTM, Billerica, MA) and secondary anti-rabbit horse radish
peroxidise antibody (1:5000 dilution). Nitration of Mn-SOD was
digitally quantified as aforementioned.
Statistical Analysis
Anthropometric measurements, maximal isometric torque,
protein content (normalized to actin), enzyme activity measure￾ments and CRP content between the groups were analyzed using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Statistica 5.0
software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK.). Functional capacity measures of
elderly subjects (AO and SO) were analyzed using an unpaired
Student’s t-test using Statistica 5.0 software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK.)
For all analyses, a two-tailed test was employed. We used Tukey’s
HSD test post-hoc to identify individual differences when statistical
significance was observed. Statistical significance was established
at a P#0.05. Data are presented as mean 6 standard deviation
(SD).
Results
Physical inactivity mediates systemic inflammation, and
loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and functional
capacity
Fat-free mass was significantly lower while percent body
fat was significantly higher in SO group relative to both the
young and AO groups (P,0.05) (Table 1). Interestingly,
there was no difference in body mass index between SO and
AO groups (Table 1). The latter findings are of importance
by emphasizing that accurate characterization of older adult
anthropometric characteristics requires measurements of
body fat and fat-free mass and that BMI is not a sensitive
parameter for sarcopenia. We also measured maximal
isometric torque as a marker of muscle strength and found
that the force generated by the SO individuals was
significantly lower in comparison to both the young and
AO groups (76% and 56%, respectively; P,0.01) (Figure 1A).
Also, the AO group generated significantly less torque
than the young group (46%; P,0.01). Similarly, SO subjects
had reduced functional capacity as indicated by walk test
and stair-climb test compared to AO group (Figure 1B).
Taken together, these results suggest that an active lifestyle
attenuates age-associated losses of muscle mass and strength.
Studies have shown that basal levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, are
lower in physically active individuals [47,48]. CRP, a marker of
chronic systemic inflammation negatively associated with physical
activity, was significantly elevated in the skeletal muscle of the SO
group relative to both the young and AO groups (297% and 82%,
respectively; P,0.05) (Figure 1C). This shows that muscle
inactivity in SO promotes low-grade chronic inflammation in
skeletal muscle of elderly.
Mitochondrial biogenesis, abundance and COX are
compromised in sedentary older adults
The SO group had significantly lower citrate synthase, PGC-1a,
and COX subunits- I and II (mtDNA-encoded) protein content
than both the young (58%, 78%, 64%, and 44%, respectively;
P,0.003) and AO (56%, 72%, 56%, and 30%, respectively;
P,0.03) groups (Figure 2A). However, the protein content of
COX subunit-IV (nuclear DNA-encoded) in the SO group was
44% lower than the young group only (P = 0.01) (Figure 2A). In
addition, the SO group had 63% higher levels of phosphorylated
GSK3b (Ser9
) relative to the AO group (P = 0.040; Figure 2A).
Both the mitochondrial citrate synthase (Figure 2B) and COX
(Figure 2C) activity were significantly lower in the SO group in
comparison with both the young (56% and 36%, respectively;
P,0.01) and AO (42% and 25%, respectively; P,0.01) groups.
Importantly, there were no significant differences in any of these
measures between the young and AO groups. This suggests that
mitochondrial biogenesis and ETC function in the skeletal muscle
remain relatively unchanged by aging in physically active
individuals, and that hypodynamia negatively affects both the
mitochondrial abundance and COX activity, indicative of reduced
mitochondrial oxidative capacity. This result likely explains the
controversy regarding the skeletal muscle mitochondrial ETC
enzyme activity with aging; namely, that differences in mitochon￾drial capacity between young and older adults is likely a function
of both chronological age as well as biological age (the latter due
primarily to physical activity levels) [33–38,40,41]. These findings
emphasize the critical importance of defining the activity level of
participants when comparing young and old and/or evaluating the
potency of an intervention in attenuating or reversing aging￾associated pathologies. Interestingly, we observed a significant
correlation between COX activity and maximal isometric torque
(R = 0.77, P,0.001) looking across all the participants in the study
(Figure 2D). This clearly demonstrates that muscle strength is
directly associated with the muscle mitochondrial oxidative
capacity.
Mitochondrial Mn-SOD activity is preserved in
recreationally active, but not sedentary, older adults
During the aging process, the rate of superoxide radical (O-.
2)
generation increases [49]. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial
superoxide dismutases function as a first line of defence against
oxidative stress-mediated by O-.
2 [50]. The protein content of
mitochondrial Mn-SOD was significantly lower in the SO group
relative to both the young and AO groups (85% and 69%,
respectively; P,0.001) (Figure 3A). The total-SOD and Mn-SOD
activity were significantly lower in the SO group compared with
the young (14% and 26%, respectively; P,0.03) and AO (24%
and 32%, respectively; P,0.03) groups (Figure 3B). Surprisingly,
no significant differences in both the total-SOD and Mn-SOD
activity were detected between the AO and young groups
(Figure 3B); even though the AO group has 55% lower Mn￾SOD protein content when compared to the young (P,0.001)
(Figure 3A). There was no difference in cytosolic Cu/Zn-SOD
protein content and enzyme activity between the three groups
(data not shown). Since aging in skeletal muscle is widely related
to increases in O-.
2 production via mitochondrial ETC, we
suggest that physical activity maintains mitochondrial Mn-SOD
activity in AO individuals at levels observed in much younger
individuals despite significant reductions in the Mn-SOD protein
content.
Mn-SOD tyrosine residue is nitrated in the skeletal
muscle of desentary older adults
In addition to ROS, an increase in cellular peroxynitrite
(ONOO-
) radical-mediated damage has been implicated in aging￾associated pathologies [51–55]. ONOO- radical is a potent
nitrating and oxidizing agent which is formed by a rapid reaction
of nitric oxide (NO) with O-.
2 anion. Mn-SOD is susceptible to
rapid inactivation by ONOO–mediated nitration of critical active￾site tyrosine residue [50]. To determine whether nitration was
related to the decline of Mn-SOD activity in the SO group, Mn￾SOD nitration was evaluated following immuno-precipitation of
Sedentary Aging & Mitochondria

Mn-SOD. Nitrotyrosine content of immunoprecipitated Mn-SOD
was significantly higher in the SO group as compared to both the
young and AO groups (64% for both; P,0.001) (Figure 4A). An
increase in peroxynitrite could result from increased cellular NO
following an increase in inducible NOS (iNOS) expression or
overactivation of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS

(nNOS) [50]. Thus, the protein content of nNOS was evaluated
and found to be significantly higher in the SO group relative to
both the AO and young groups (171% and 92%, respectively;
P,0.01) (Figure 4B). Together, these results suggest that physical
activity preserves Mn-SOD activity in AO individuals, likely due
to attenuation of age-associated nitration of Mn-SOD. Taken
together, the results suggest that hypodynamia-mediated dysreg￾ulation of antioxidant cascade makes the intracellular environment
more conducive to pro-oxidant production, resulting in a cellular
‘‘redox crisis’’.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that a sedentary lifestyle,
associated with osteoarthritis mediated hypodynamia, promoted
loss of muscle strength, weakness, and reductions in functional
capacity, fat-free mass, and mitochondrial oxidative capacity
concomitant with ‘‘low-grade’’ chronic inflammation in the
skeletal muscle of older adults. However in recreationally active
older adults, mitochondrial biogenesis and ETC function are
relatively preserved in skeletal muscle. The mitochondrial
antioxidant enzyme milieu of active older adults provides an
intra-organellar environment conducive to O-.
2 dismutation via
maintenance of their Mn-SOD activity at levels similar to those
found in young subjects, despite an aging-associated decline in
Mn-SOD content in skeletal muscle. Conversely, the skeletal
muscle of sedentary older adults fails to modulate the intracellular

environment which is thus prone to ROS-mediated toxicity and
aberrant redox homeostasis.
The effects of aging on skeletal muscle are invariantly
characterized by a progressive loss of strength and power, muscle
mass, gait velocity, endurance, and, as result, overall performance
[56–60]. In addition to muscle loss with aging, frailty manifests as
a multi-system pathology resulting in systemic weakness with low
muscle strength, fatigability, exhaustion, and exercise intolerance
in 20–30% of older adults [9,61]. In this study, SO subjects had
low levels of physical activity secondary to osteoarthritis, a
pathology manifested solely due to daily mechanical stress￾mediated wear and tear over the lifespan of an individual
[62,63]. Osteoarthritis should not be confused with rheumatoid
arthritis (an autoimmune disease with joint inflammation) since
inflammation is not a conspicuous feature of the disease [62].
Patients with osteoarthritis have reduced quality of life and
experience a sedentary lifestyle due to pain associated with the
disease [63]. Wilkie et al. (2007) also reported that knee pain
severity was strongly associated with restricted mobility of subjects,
further showing that joint pain (as a result of knee OA) will render
patients immobile [64]. Hence, age- and gender- matched SO
subjects provide an excellent sedentary control group for
physically active AO subjects to study the relationship between a
physically active lifestyle and skeletal muscle maintenance and
bioenergetic homeostasis in the elderly. Recently, Ruiz and
colleagues (2008) reported that muscular strength is inversely
and independently associated with all cause mortality in men [65].
Here we demonstrate that even though older adults show an age￾associated reduction in skeletal muscle maximal isometric torque
relative to young adults, the loss of muscle strength in AO is
dramatically attenuated in comparison to age-matched SO
subjects (Figure 1A). AO subjects had higher functional capacity
compared to SO subjects (Figure 1B), an indirect indication of
better quality of life and functional independence which is a
function of cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity status
(Mailey et al., 2010 BMC Public Health). This is consistent with
our previous work where six months of resistance training resulted
in significant gains in fat-free muscle mass, muscle strength and
endurance, and functional capacity in older adults [45,66]. The
rate of decline in maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) with age is
attenuated in adults who perform regular aerobic exercise and are
physically active [67,68]. Similarly, a regular exercise regimen,
physical therapy and lifestyle modification are therapeutic in
alleviating pain, reducing the progression of disease and improving
overall quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis [69,70]. Better
adherence to recommended home exercises as well as being more
physically active improves the long-term effectiveness of exercise
therapy in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee [63,69–71].
Taken together, the aforementioned results imply that physical
activity is an effective counter-measure to sarcopenia, preserving
skeletal muscle function and independence in the elderly.
Frailty and disability in older adult muscle is also associated with
increased production of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines
[72,73]. Higher serum levels of markers of inflammation in the
elderly are associated with several age-associated co-morbidities
including dementia, Parkinson’s disease, atherosclerosis, type 2
diabetes, sarcopenia, functional disability, and are strong inde￾pendent risk factors of morbidity and mortality in the elderly
[74,75]. CRP is an acute phase reactant and is a marker of
systemic inflammation that is under direct IL-6 transcriptional
control [9]. Physical inactivity is associated with elevated serum
IL-6 and CRP concentrations [47,76]. In this study, we observed
that sedentary lifestyle promotes ‘‘low-grade’’ chronic inflamma￾tion in skeletal muscle based on our finding that skeletal muscle
CRP was elevated in the SO group vs. both the young and AO
subjects (Figure 1C). Our results are in agreement with the
InCHIANTI study, which demonstrated that high levels of pro￾inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and CRP) are significantly associated
with poor physical performance and muscle strength in subjects 65
years and older [77]. Recently, Buford and colleagues (2010) have
shown that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) content, an
evolutionarily conserved transcription factor involved in stimulat￾ing more than 150 genes involved in inflammation and protein
turnover resulting in disuse-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, is
significantly higher in the skeletal muscle of sedentary old vs. both
young and active old groups [78]. In addition, recent studies have
reported low-grade chronic inflammation in patients with
osteoarthritis [79–82]. We believe that this systemic inflammation
is secondary to physical inactivity due to osteoarthritis, and not a
direct cause of pathology. We speculate that CRP-mediated
chronic systemic inflammation may lead to long-term skeletal
muscle damage, and thereby contribute directly to sarcopenia.
Based on these observations and the self-reported activity pattern
of our subject groups, we suggest that skeletal muscle CRP levels
could potentially be used as an easily quantifiable diagnostic
biomarker to assess lifestyle and activity levels of elderly
individuals.
The mitochondrial theory of aging stipulates that an increase
in free radicals oxidize macromolecules that would compromise
the bioenergetics and functional capacity of the cell [28].
Mitochondria are not only the primary source of cellular
metabolic energy production, but are also the major site of ROS
production [41,83]. It has been demonstrated that ROS,
produced by the mitochondria, are maintained at a relatively
high level within mitochondrial matrix [84]. Given the
proximity of mtDNA and other mitochondrial proteins, it is
possible that these molecules are at a greater risk of incurring
oxidative insults and, in turn, leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction [85]. Skeletal muscle from older adults and aged
rodents have consistently shown an accumulation of somatic
mtDNA mutations and large scale deletions, and a transcrip￾tome ‘‘signature’’ indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction
[32,86]. Balagopal et al. (1997) reported a marked decrease in
muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis rates in older adults
[87]. Despite the reported detrimental effects of aging on
mitochondrial redox status and mtDNA stability, the nature of
the change in the mitochondrial ETC in human skeletal muscle
is equivocal. Many studies have demonstrated a significant age￾related reduction in mitochondrial ETC complex enzymes
[34–37], while others failed to observe such changes [33,38–41].
Barrientos and colleagues (1996) reported that after correcting
for tobacco consumption and physical activity as confounding
variables there was no apparent age-related decrease in
mitochondrial oxidative capacity, suggesting that ETC function
does not change as a result of ‘normal’ aging [38]. We first
measured the protein content of PGC-1a, a master regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis that plays a crucial role in co￾ordinating nuclear and mtDNA gene transcription [88]. The
PGC-1a was not different between AO and young subjects
(Figure 2A). Correspondingly, we observed similar levels of
nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoded COX subunits as well
as mitochondrial enzyme activity (COX and CS) in the AO
compared to the young group (Figures 2A-C). On the other
hand, SO adults had a significant reduction in PGC-1a and
evidence of reduced mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochon￾drial COX activity in comparison with both the active old and
young adults (Figures 2A-C). Since PGC-1a is proposed to be
involved in co-ordinating mitochondrial biogenesis in response
Sedentary Aging & Mitochondria

to exercise [89,90], our findings suggest that physical inactivity
may lead to lower PGC-1a and contribute to the subsequent
reduction in mitochondrial capacity in the SO subjects.
Surprisingly, we observed a significant positive correlation
between complex IV activity and skeletal muscle strength across
all the subjects in the study (Figure 2D). Indeed studies by Akien
and colleagues have reported a direct link between mitochon￾drial aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle where mitochondrial
abnormalities (decrease in mitochondrial activity and increase in
mtDNA deletions) are positively associated with muscle fiber
atrophy and splitting, and ragged red fibers in aged rats [27,91].
Hence, this observation further supports our conclusion that an
active lifestyle not only maintains muscle mitochondrial COX
activity during aging, but also preserves skeletal muscle mass, an
important predictor of mortality and aging associated co￾morbidities [65].
Previous research has suggested that reduced PGC-1a mRNA
expression is associated with lower mitochondrial function in aging
[88,92,93]. Activation of PGC-1a has been identified as a
potential therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of
many age-related declines in physiological function, including
insulin resistance [94], inflammation [92], and muscle atrophy
(i.e., sarcopenia) [95]. PGC-1a has also been implicated in the
cellular antioxidant response [96], and our findings indicate that
lower PGC-1a content may also contribute to the ‘‘redox crisis’’ in
the SO subjects. In addition, Anderson and colleagues (2008) have
shown that GSK-3b negatively regulates PGC-1a activity by
targeting it to nuclear proteasomal degradation [97]. We observed
a significant increase in GSK-3b activation (Figure 2A) in SO
subject vs. both the young and AO groups which may also explain
the reduction in PGC-1a content in SO. Our findings suggest that,
at the protein level, a physically active lifestyle may maintain
skeletal muscle PGC-1a expression, which likely contributes to
improved mitochondrial capacity, antioxidant defence systems,
and muscle performance. The reduction in PGC-1a, mitochon￾drial function, and antioxidant enzymes in the SO group provides
indirect evidence that when aging is accompanied by a sedentary
lifestyle, PGC-1a and the stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis
decline, potentially contributing to the reduction in mitochondrial
function, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced
muscular strength.
Since we observed a dysfunction in mitochondrial COX
activity in the skeletal muscle of SO group, we next investigated
mitochondrial Mn-SOD which constitutes the first line of
defence against O-.
2 radical formation as a result of electron
leakage from mitochondrial ETC [45]. We observed a
significant reduction in both Mn-SOD protein content and
activity in the SO adults relative to both the AO and young
adults (Figures 3A and 3B). Interestingly, Mn-SOD activity was
preserved in the AO adults, despite a significant reduction in
their Mn-SOD content compared to the young (Figure 3B).
There was no difference in cytosolic Cu/Zn-SOD protein
content and enzyme activity between the three groups (data not
shown). Since aging is widely associated with an increase in O-.
2
anion production via mitochondrial ETC in skeletal muscle, we
suggest that the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme milieu of
recreationally active older adults provides an intra-organellar
environment conducive to O-.
2 dismutation via maintaining
Mn-SOD activity similar to that found in young subjects. This is
in agreement with our previous findings where we demonstrated
an age-associated increase in Mn-SOD activity in recreationally
active older adults compared to young subjects [33].
The disagreement observed between Mn-SOD protein content
and its activity in the AO adults is intriguing and suggests that Mn￾SOD activity may be modulated by post-translational modification
[66]. Pathological increases in cellular NO levels due to an
increase in iNOS expression or overactivation of eNOS and
nNOS result in the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-
) radical
[67]. The ONOO- radical can cause lipid peroxidation and DNA
damage, and is considered to be a potent tyrosine-nitrating species
[66]. Exposure of human recombinant Mn-SOD protein to
peroxynitrite in vitro causes highly specific nitration of tyrosine-34
at the active site of the Mn-SOD enzyme, resulting in inhibition of
its catalytic activity [50]. Inactivation of Mn-SOD activity leads to
futile cycling of O-.
2, resulting in an amplification of oxidative
stress [69]. We hypothesized that physical inactivity-associated
dysregulation in mitochondrial COX activity may result in
aberrant formation of free radicals, i.e., O-.
2, OH.
, ONOO-
,
etc., via activation of NOS content, thus producing pathological
levels of NO and causing inactivation of Mn-SOD in the skeletal
muscle of the frail old subjects. Indeed, we observed that the
skeletal muscle of the SO had higher amounts of both the nNOS
content and nitrotyrosine content of immunoprecipitated Mn￾SOD than both young and AO adults (Figures 4A and 4B). This
phenomenon appears to be involved in ischemia-reperfusion
injury, chronic rejection of transplanted organs, inflammatory
diseases, neurological disorders (including amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis), atherosclero￾sis, and viral infections [66,67,69]. Together, these observations
suggest that Mn-SOD activity in the skeletal muscle is maintained
with a physically active lifestyle, and that sedentary lifestyle￾mediated mitochondrial ETC dysregulation makes the intracellu￾lar environment more conducive to pro-oxidant production,
resulting in the inactivation of Mn-SOD, insufficient dismutation
of O2
- radical and mitochondrial redox crisis.
The findings of this study highlight the complexity of
coordinated regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency
and cellular redox homeostasis in skeletal muscle, and functional
capacity of older adults. We believe that a physically active
lifestyle promotes redundancy and adaptations throughout the
aging process via activation of antioxidant defence and repair
pathways that allow the cell to maintain energy homeostasis
despite the accumulation of abnormalities (somatic mtDNA
mutations and deletions, and DNA, protein and lipid oxidation).
Conversely, a sedentary lifestyle during aging is negatively
correlated with these adaptations mainly due to the dysregulation
of redox signaling and reduced mitochondrial function that
renders the intracellular environment prone to pro-oxidant
production and an aberrant redox homeostasis. Since a physically
active lifestyle is suggested to have therapeutic potential against
osteoarthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, obesity, type II diabetes,
sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome and associated co-morbidities, it
is intriguing to speculate that maintenance of the mitochondrial
bioenergetic capacity via regular exercise training may combat
these pathologies.
