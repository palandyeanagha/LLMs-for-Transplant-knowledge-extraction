Historical perspective
In 1832, following a suggestion by his mentor Dr William 
Brooke O’Shaugnessy, Dr Th omas Latta reported his 
physical examination fi ndings after administrating a 
saline-based solution to a critically ill and dehydrated 
cholera patient, at a time when blood-letting was still the 
standard of care for this condition [1]: 
Having inserted a tube into the basilic vein, 
cautiously-anxiously, I watched the eff ects; ounce 
after ounce was injected, but no visible change 
was produced. Still persevering, I thought she 
began to breathe less laboriously, soon the 
sharpened features, and sunken eye, and fallen 
jaw, pale and cold, bearing the manifest impress of 
death’s signet, began to glow with returning 
animation; the pulse, which had long ceased, 
returned to the wrist; at fi rst small and quick, by 
degrees it became more and more distinct, fuller, 
slower, and fi rmer, and in the short pace of half an 
hour, when six pints had been injected, she 
expressed in a fi rm voice that she was free from all 
uneasiness, actually became jocular, and fancied 
all she needed was a little sleep; her extremities 
were warm and every feature bore the aspect of 
comfort and health. [2]
Th is heretical yet highly successful intervention led to 
the achievement of a succession of important milestones, 
including the fi rst use of intravenous albumin in 1834 by 
Dr John Mackintosh and the introduction of Ringer’s 
solution in 1876 by Sidney Ringer [3], which was modi￾fi ed by Dr Alexis Hartmann to include lactate in 1876 [4]. 
Despite the accumulating evidence supporting the effi -
cacy of intravenous fl uid therapy for conditions that, in 
hindsight, would be labeled as some form of hypovolemia, 
the widespread use of intravenous fl uid therapy would 
wait three-quarters of a century until the invention of the 
Rochester plastic needle  – a needle-styletted plastic 
catheter – by the Mayo Clinic anesthesiology resident Dr 
David Massa in 1950 [5]. 
Types of fl uid
Crystalloid solutions
Components of crystalloid solutions include inorganic 
ions such as sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, 
and calcium, as well as small organic substances such as 
glucose or lactate [6]. Examples of commonly used crys￾talloid solutions and their compositions are summarized 
in Table 1. 
Relevant diff erences between these solutions include 
the potassium and calcium concentrations (which 
theoretically may aff ect their use in renal failure patients 
as well as their suitability for mixture with citrated blood 
products), chloride concentrations and strong ion diff er￾ence (which ultimately aff ects the acid–base status of the 
recipient [7]), and cost. 
One myth regarding crystalloid selection deserves 
further assessment – calcium-containing solutions are 
not absolutely contraindicated in the setting of trans￾fusion. Most studies demonstrating clotting were based 
on citrate–phosphate–dextrose–adenine preserved packed 
red blood cells; newer preservatives, such as AS-3, 
contain less plasma and more citrate, and are much less 
Abstract
Intravenous fl uid therapy has evolved signifi cantly over 
time. From the initial report of the fi rst intravenous 
administration of sodium-chloride-based solution 
to the development of goal-directed fl uid therapy 
using novel dynamic indices, eff orts have focused on 
improving patient outcomes. The goal of this review 
is to provide a brief overview of current concepts for 
intravenous fl uid administration in the ICU. Results of 
recently published clinical trials suggesting harmful 
eff ects of starch-based solutions on critically ill patients 
are discussed. Concepts for goal-directed fl uid therapy 
and new modalities for the assessment of fl uid status as 
well as for the prediction of responsiveness to diff erent 
interventions will continue to emerge. Advances in 
technology will have to be critically evaluated for 
their ability to improve outcomes in diff erent clinical 
scenarios.

likely to be overwhelmed by the small amount of calcium 
present in isotonic crystalloids [8]. 
Colloid solutions
Colloid solutions consist of homogeneous, noncrystalline 
large molecules or ultramicroscopic particles (the in ter￾nal phase) dispersed throughout another substance (the 
dispersion medium). Colloid solutions can be categorized 
as blood-derived, such as albumin, plasma protein 
fraction, and fresh frozen plasma, or as semisynthetic 
(hydroxyethylstarch (HES), dextrans, and gelatins) [6], 
several of which are described in Table 2. Base solutions 
for colloid preparations include normal and hypertonic 
saline, isotonic glucose, as well as other balanced solu￾tions such as Ringer’s lactate or Ringer’s acetate.
Th e primary rationale for administering colloid solu￾tion in the setting of hypovolemia is the desire to expand 
plasma volume more eff ectively and extend the treatment 
duration. Th e larger solutes present in colloidal solutions 
are theoretically resistant to passage across the capillary 
membrane, and hence preserve intravascular oncotic 
pressure and prevent extravasation in accordance with 
the Starling equation. While this may work in theory, 
randomized controlled human trials comparing crystal￾loids with colloids suggest that the volumetric equiva￾lence of colloids to crystalloids is not 1:3, as is classically 
taught, but somewhere between 1:1.3 and 1:2.1 [9].
Colloid versus crystalloid
In vitro and animal studies
Resuscitation of critically ill patients with colloid 
solutions has been suggested to improve oxygen delivery 
to the tissues. Initial evidence stems from a small experi￾mental study in a rodent sepsis model, where resus￾citation with HES (130 kDa) led to decreased leukocyte 
adhesion and a better maintained capillary integrity, as 
measured by macromolecular leakage, when compared 
with normal saline [10]. In an in vitro study into the 
eff ects of 25% albumin versus 6% HES (670  kDa) on 
endothelial infl am mation, however, albumin seemed to 
show a modestly favorable profi le as compared with HES 
[11].
In a sheep study of endotoxin-induced septic shock, 
resuscitation with larger molecular weight starch (HES 
200/0.5) was found to cause a greater decrease in renal 
function and a higher degree of tubular disruption than 
therapy with HES 130/0.4 or crystalloid (Sterofundin® 
ISO, B. Braun Melsungen, Germany) [12]. Since the study 
lasted only 12 hours, acute kidney disease could probably 
have worsened over time in either group. Deposition of 
HES into hepatocytes has been reported in patients with 
worsening hepatic dysfunction [13]. Although the 
complete mechanism for HES-associated renal dysfunc￾tion remains to be discovered, recent in vitro data suggest 
deposition of HES as vesicle-like structures into proximal 
tubular cells, as well as decreased cell culture survival with 
HES com pared with incubation with crystalloids [14].
Clinical studies
Mortality in critically ill patients
Th e clinical relevance of the theoretical advantages of 
colloids (with regards to eff ects on the microvasculature) 
was questioned as early as the late 1970s [15]. Clinicians 
would have to wait almost 30 years, until the completion 
of the landmark Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation 
(SAFE) trial, to begin to draw defi nitive conclusions. Th e 
SAFE trial compared the eff ects of 4% albumin versus 
normal saline in 6,997 critically ill patients [16] and found 
no diff er ence in the primary outcome (all-cause mortality 
at 28  days). Subgroup analysis revealed a possible asso￾cia tion between the use of albumin and increased 
mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. It 
should be noted that this post hoc analysis was performed 
on only 492 patients or 7% of the original study 
population. In a follow-up report of 460 traumatic brain 
injury patients from the original SAFE trial, the 
association of albumin with higher mortality rates in this 
group persisted at 2 years following randomization [17].
Th e quality and power of previous trials on the safety of 
low molecular weight starches was questioned in a

meta-analysis of 36 clinical studies (11 of which had 
previously been retracted) [18]. Th e more recent 
Scandinavian 6S trial compared low molecular HES 
(130/0.42) in a Ringer’s acetate dispersion medium with 
Ringer’s acetate without starch in the resuscitation of 804 
septic ICU patients. Th is multicenter, randomized, and 
blinded clini cal trial reported that use of up to 33 ml/kg 
of 6% HES (130/0.42) had a signifi cantly higher risk of 
reaching the primary outcome, defi ned as death or need 
for renal replacement therapy at 90  days following 
randomization, in 51% of enrolled patients compared 
with 43% of enrolled patients receiving Ringer’s acetate 
[19]. As only one patient in each group was receiving 
renal replace ment therapy at 90  days, HES 130/42 
increased the absolute risk of death at 90  days by 
8  percentage points. Rates of severe bleeding were 
numerically higher in the HES group compared with 
crystalloid (10% vs. 6%), although this did not reach 
statistical signifi cance (P = 0.09). 
Th e Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial com￾pared the blinded administration of up to 50 ml/kg body 
weight/day HES (130/0.4, Voluven; Fresenius Kabi AG, 
Bad Homburg, Germany) in normal saline versus normal 
saline alone in adult patients requir ing fl uid resuscitation 
following admission to an ICU [20]. Th e primary 
endpoint of all-cause mortalit y at 90 days was 17% in the 
normal saline group and 18% in the HES group. Th is 
diff erence did not reach statistical signifi cance. Analysis 
of secondary endpoints revealed an association between 
HES use and acute kidney injury and a 21% relative risk 
increase for renal replacement therapy. Hepatic failure as 
well as increased use of blood products was also more 
common in the HES group, although a mild volume￾sparing eff ect (90 ml and 246 ml diff erence in the volumes 
of study and nonstudy fl uid, respectively, during fi rst 4 
days in ICU) was observed. In summary, HES (130/0.4) 
did not provide any substantial advantages to ICU 
patients requiring intravenous fl uid resuscitation and the 
analysis of secondary endpoints confi rmed an association 
of its use with renal injury. 
Acute kidney injury
Increasing degrees of oncocity in colloid solutions have 
been implicated in the incidence of acute kidney disease 
in a prospective nonrandomized cohort study of 1,013 
ICU patients with shock. Both hyperoncotic semi syn￾thetic colloids and hyperoncotic albumin were associated 
with increased incidences of renal events as compared 
with crystalloid solutions [21]. A prospective, non￾randomized, cohort study of 346 patients who received 
HES, gelatin, or crystalloids for fl uid resuscitation in the 
setting of sepsis showed acute kidney injury rates of 70%, 
68%, and 47%, respectively [22]. In a retrospective study 
of 563 cardiac surgery patients, an independent asso cia￾tion between the ad minis tered dose of Pentastarch 
(250  kDa) and the develop ment of acute kidney disease 
was made [23]. 
Th e clinical association of both high and low molecular 
weight starches with renal dysfunction has been con￾fi rmed in multiple clinical trials. In the randomized 
multicenter Volume Substitution and Insulin Th erapy in 
Severe Sepsis trial, HES administration was associated 
with higher rates of acute kidney disease and renal 
replacement therapy than was administration of lactated 
Ringer’s solution [24]. However, this was not the primary 
outcome of this trial. Most recently, the results of the 
Scandinavian 6S trial were made available: while the 
number of patients receiving renal replacement therapy 
at 90 days was no diff erent, patients who were random￾ized to colloids were signifi cantly more likely to require 
renal replacement therapy during their hospitalization 
(P = 0.04) [25]. 
Hemodynamic diff erences and bleeding risk
Hartog’s assertion that the hemodynamic advantages of 
colloids are overstated [9] has been supported by more

recent data. In a randomized clinical trial of 196 sepsis 
patients receiving resuscitation, comparing HES 130/0.4 
with normal saline, HES reduced the volume to reach 
hemodynamic stability only from 1.709 to 1.379 liters, 
but it had no eff ect on the cumulative fl uid balance while 
in the ICU [26]. Th e assessment of safety profi les of 
currently used HES formulations had to be critically re￾evaluated, following the discovery of fraudulent research 
that possibly favored their use [27,28]. Th e association of 
HES and post operative bleeding is well established. A 
decrease in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor have 
been linked to the older, large-molecular HES formu la￾tions [29] and similarly increased bleeding has been 
noted following cardiac surgery [30]. 
Th e current consensus statement of the European 
Society of Intensive Care Medicine already discourages 
the use of HES in patients with severe sepsis or acute 
kidney disease [31]. Th e results of both the recent 
Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial and the 6S￾trial will probably result in a more narrow defi nition of its 
use in critically ill patients. 
Goal-directed fl uid therapy
For decades, attempts at answering the question ‘how 
much fl uid do I give?’ focused on the amount of fl uid 
given (usually some arbitrary infusion rate with boluses 
as needed) and neglected the timing of fl uid adminis￾tration. Interpretation of the myriad of available liberal 
versus restrictive studies is complicated by a complete 
lack of standardized defi nitions of liberal and restrictive. 
In the early 2000s, several landmark papers suggested 
that there might be a more rational way to manage 
hemodynamics with fl uid administration.
By manipulating hemodynamics using a complex 
formula designed to achieve specifi c targets for mean 
arterial pressure, urine output, and central venous oxygen 
saturation in septic patients, Rivers and colleagues 
showed that mortality could be improved by expanding 
one’s hemodynamic goals beyond simply maintaining 
adequate blood pressure [32]. One year later, Gan and 
colleagues showed that a decrease in length of hospital 
stay and earlier return of bowel function was achieved 
using a protocol based on optimization of corrected fl ow 
time (an esophageal Doppler-derived index of preload) 
and stroke volume (also derived using esophageal 
Doppler monitoring) [33].
Th e clinical value of goal-directed fl uid administration 
has also been demonstrated in other clinical settings and 
long-term benefi cial eff ects in patients undergoing high￾risk procedures have been suggested [34]. Limiting the 
total amounts of crystalloid infused was associated with 
decreased complications after major surgery in two 
groups that were randomized to a low rate or a high rate 
of crystalloid maintenance [35], suggesting that a fl uid 
restrictive strategy in conjunction with goal-directed 
therapy might be benefi cial. Not all data are supportive. 
In an earlier study by Gattinoni and colleagues, no 
diff erence in mortality in the ICU and at 6 months was 
detected in 762 critically ill patients randomized to three 
diff erent hemodynamic goals (normal cardiac index, 
cardiac index >4.5 l/minute/m2
, or normal mixed venous 
oxygen satura tion ≥70%) [36]. A recent trial studying the 
eff ects of goal-directed intraoperative fl uid therapy using 
esophageal Doppler monitoring failed to show a bene￾fi cial eff ect and actually found adverse eff ects in the 
intervention group. One should note that this study did 
not show a diff erence in the amount of fl uid (colloid or 
crystalloid) administered to both groups [37]. Results of a 
randomized trial investigating mortality in 3,141 children 
with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion in sub￾Saharan Africa surprisingly showed higher mortality at 
48 hours and at 4 weeks in the group that did not receive 
any fl uid boluses compared with two groups resuscitated 
with albumin or saline [38]. Th ese results challenge our 
understanding of the potential benefi ts of early fl uid 
administration in septic shock and certainly merit further 
study in other relevant patient groups. However, since 
this study was performed in a resource-poor environment 
with limited intensive care and monitoring capabilities, 
conclusions are probably not directly translatable to 
clinical practice in other settings. 
Overall, it appears that hemodynamic management 
protocols that focus on either preload or stroke volume 
optimization, as opposed to maintenance of an arbitrary 
threshold of blood pressure (or worse, continuous 
infusion of fl uids at an unchanging rate), can improve 
outcomes. In a meta-analysis of 5,056 surgical patients 
randomized to tissue-perfusion-based hemodynamic 
protocols in 32 studies, mortality was reduced (pooled 
odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confi dence interval = 0.55 to 0.82) 
[39]. Similarly, a meta-analysis in critically ill patients 
randomized to preemptive hemodynamic management 
(including 4,805 patients from 29 trials) also found a 
reduction in mortality (pooled odds ratio  = 0.48, 95% 
confi dence interval = 0.33 to 0.78) [40].
An exciting and relatively new series of hemodynamic 
endpoints that have fi rm grounding in cardiorespiratory 
physiology, but whose impact on clinical outcomes has 
not been fully discovered, has emerged. Dynamic indices 
attempt to predict the hemodynamic response to volume 
administration (that is, change in cardiac output after a 
standardized fl uid bolus) and are based on the interaction 
between intrathoracic pressure changes and left 
ventricular end-diastolic volume and cardiac output. 
Th ese new modalities seem to better answer the question 
‘what will happen to oxygen delivery if I administer 
fl uids?’ [41]. Common variants available in clinical prac￾tice include systolic pressure variation, pulse pressure

variation, stroke volume variation, and the Pleth Varia￾bility Index. Systolic pressure variation, pulse pressure 
variation, and stroke volume variation can be determined 
via arterial blood pressure tracings. Stroke volume 
variation can also be obtained from minimally invasive 
methods, such as esophageal Doppler measurements, 
and non-invasive cardiac output monitoring using 
bioreactance technology  – but other methods, such as 
low-frequency oscillations in the plethysmographic 
waveform (Pleth Variability Index), are also predictive of 
arterial blood pressure changes induced by mechanical 
ventilation, and have also been used to successfully 
predict fl uid responsiveness [42]. To determine whether 
or not these new monitoring technologies will also lead 
to improved patient outcomes will require appropriately 
powered clinical trials in the future. 
Summary
Results of multiple smaller clinical trials and recent larger 
randomized controlled clinical trials advise against the 
use of both high and low molecular weight starch-based 
solutions in the care of critically ill patients, because they 
appear to increase morbidity and rates of renal dys￾function. No convincing data support their impact on 
improving outcomes. Based on the SAFE trial, albumin 
and crystalloids appear to have equal eff ects on mortality 
in critically ill patients, with the exception of patients 
with traumatic brain injury.
Goal-directed fl uid therapy designed to optimize either 
stroke volume or preload has been validated in multiple 
patient groups and has the potential to improve 
meaningful clinical outcomes. Physicians should resist 
the blood-pressure-centric approach to hemodynamic 
management that has, for practical reasons, been the 
dominant paradigm for over a century, and should make 
every eff ort to utilize the currently available technology 
that can help them give fl uids when they are needed, and 
to restrict them when they are not. Future studies should 
address both the ideal combination of monitoring devices 
as well as the choice of fl uids in order to develop the best 
possible treatment strategy for specifi c clinical scenarios. 
In parti cular, stroke volume variation, arterial respiratory 
varia tion, and low-frequency oscillations in the photo￾plethys mo graphic waveforms are attractive candi date 
endpoints that need to be further assessed.
A successful fl uid management strategy needs to be 
incorporated into a multimodal interdisciplinary plan of 
care. We are reminded of this by Dr Latta’s humbling 
closing of his fi rst account of an initially successful 
resuscitation of a dehydrated cholera patient that fell 
short on these grounds:
Th is being my fi rst case, I fancied my patient 
secure, and from my great need for a little repose, 
left her in charge of the hospital surgeon; but I had 
not been long gone, ere the vomiting and purging 
recurring, soon reduced her to her former state of 
debility. I was not apprised of the event, and she 
sunk in fi ve and a half hours after I left her. As she 
had previously been of sound constitution, I have 
no doubt the case would have resulted in complete 
reaction, had the remedy, which already had 
produced such eff ect, been repeated. [2]
Key messages
• HES appears to cause harm and should be avoided in 
the septic population and in patients at risk for kidney 
injury.
• Th e timing of fl uid administration is just as important 
as (if not more important than) the amount given.
• Goal-directed fl uid therapy designed to optimize 
either stroke volume or preload is well established in 
high-risk patient groups and should be considered in 
all critically ill patients.
• New modalities for assessment of dynamic indices 
off er non-invasive options to guide fl uid therapy and 
assess the likely hemodynamic response to volume 
administration.
