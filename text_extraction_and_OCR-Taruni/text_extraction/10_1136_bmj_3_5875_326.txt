Summary
Biopsy of renal tissue from four patients with idio￾pathic focal nephritis and three patients with Henoch￾Sch&inlein syndrome showed that C3 and properdin were
deposited with IgA in the glomerular mesangium. Clq
could not be detected. These observations suggest that
glomerular injury in disorders characterized by mesangial
deposits of IgA and C3 is mediated via the properdin system.
Introduction
Focal glomerulonephritis is well recognized as an acoom￾paniment of various systemic diseases-such as bacterial
endocarditis, systemic lupus erythematcsus, polyarteritis
nodosa, Goodpasture's syndrome, andHenoch-Schonleinsyn￾drome (Heptinstall, 1966)-but at least half the cases diag￾nosed on renal biopsy are not accompanied by systemic
manifestations. This last group has long been recognized as
presenting a distinctive clinical picture of recurrem episodes
of haematuria accompanying upper respiratory tract infec￾tion (Volhard and Fahr, 1914; Baehir, 1926; Heptinstall and
Joekes, 1959; Ross, 1960). In most of these patients glomeru￾lar disease does not progress to renal failure; the condition
has therefore been tenned benign recurrent haematuria
(Ayoub and Vernier, 1965).
A major contributon to the immunopathology of this dis￾order was made when Berger (1969) found that a group of
patients with this syndrome had deposits of IgA in the
glomerular mesangium. Berger also found C3 deposits in a
distribution similar to the IgA; IgG was often present, but in
much smaller amounts as judged by the immunofluorescent
appearances. Similar mesangial deposits of IgA and C3
(though usually with more pronounced fibrin deposition)
have subsequently been reported in patients with Henoch￾Sch6nlein syndrome (Berger et al., 1971).
The cause of C3 deposition in these syndromes has been
puzzling, since IgA was known to be incapable of fixing
complement via the classical pathway (involving Cl, C4, and
C2). Gotze and Muller-Eberhard (1971) reported that aggre￾gated IgA was capable of fixing C3 via the alternative path￾Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London W12 OHS

way. This raised the possibility that C3 deposition in the
glomeruli of patients with mesangial IgA was the result of
activation of this pathway. Though the precise reacton
sequence of the alternative pathway remains incompletely
clarified, activation of C3 in vitro is known to involve proper￾din and the glycine-rich f3-glycoprotein (GBG or factor B
of the properdin system) (Lachmann and Nicol, 1973). The
purpose of this communication is to report the association of
properdin and GBG with the mesangial deposits of C3 and
IgA in idiopathic focal nephritis and Henoch-Sch6nlein
syndrome.
Methods
Renal biopsy specimens from seven patients were studied;
all showed deposits of IgA in the mesangium. Four were ob￾tained from patients with idiopathic focal nephritis present￾ing with haematuria and three from patients with Henoch￾Schbnlein syndrome.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENT STUDIES
Tissue was "snap-frozen" in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-70'C. Three-micron cryostat sections were fixed in dry
acetone at 4'C and washed in phosphate-buffered saline.
Sections were treated with fluorescein-conjugated antisera
to IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, Clq, and GBG; properdin deposition
was detected by an indirect technique using a 1:8 diluton
of rabbit anti-human properdin antiserum and fluorescein￾conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibody. Antisera to IgG, IgA,
and IgM were obtained from Wellcome Reagents Ltd.,
Beckenham, U.K. Antisera to Clq, C3, and GBG were pro￾vided by Professor P. J. Lachmann, and anti-properdin was
a gene-rous gift from Drs. McLean and Michael of the
Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minnea￾polis. All antisera were tested in an Ouchterlony plate and
shown to be monospecific; in addition these reagents showed
dissociation of positive and negative staining in studies of a
large series of renal biopsies from patients with other types
of glomerulonephritis.
SERUM COMPLEMENT ASSAYS
Serum was stored at -70'C; concentrations of Clq, C4, C3,
GBG, and properdin were esitimated by radial immunodiffus￾ion. Total haemolytic complement (CH50) and the capacity
of sera to generate convertase activity with cobra factor were
measured as previously described (Lachmann et al., 1973;
Williams et al., 1973). The haemolytic activty in fresh serum
from three patients was tested before and after incubation
for six hours at 0'C.
Results
The immunofluorescent findings on the seven patients are
shown in the table. An example of mesangial properdin is
shown in the figure.

COMPLEMENT STUDIES
No abnormality was detected im the serum complemet
system. Total haemolytic complement and the serum concen￾tra-tions of the components of the classical pathway (Clq and
C4) and the alternate pathway proteins (GBG and properdin)
were in the normal range. No significant loss of CH,0 oc￾curred in six hours at O°C.
Discussion
The finding of deposits of C3 and properdin in the absence
of Clq provides good evidence that the C3 in the mes￾angium of these patients results from activation of the alter￾native pathway (the "properdin pathway"). It seems likely
that this is due to deposition of IgA, since C3 and IgA were
found in all patients, whereas IgG was undetectable in some.
Sussman et al. (1973) repovted a patient totally deficient in
C2, with the cutaneous manifestatons of Henoch-Sch6nlein
syndrome, indicating that the skin lesions can be indepen￾dent of the classical pathhway of complement activation. Our
failure to detect glycine-rich f3-glycoprotein (GBG or pro￾perdin factor B) in the glomeruli of some patients showing
properdin and C3 deposition suggests that this protein may
be released from the site of complement activation. Direct
evidence in favour of 'this interpretation has been obtained
from in vitro studies of complemnent activation by zymosan
(Brade et al., 1973).
Properdin and C3 have also been found in the glomerular
lesions of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, chronic
mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (Westberg et al., 1971),
and in a proportion of patients with systemic lupus erythe￾matosus (Rothfield et al., 1972). These disorders are often
associated with hypocomplementaemnia, and both in acute
poststreptococcal nephritis (Williams et al., 1972) and mes￾angiocapillary nephritis (Spitzer et al., 1969; Peters et al.,
1972; Thompson, 1972) there may be a circulating factor
capable of breaking down C3 in vitro. IThe factor in the
serum of pa,tients with mesangiocapillary nephritis (C3
nephritic factor) has been shown to activate C3 by la reaction
involving components of the alternative pathway (Williams
et al., 1973). Day and Good (1973) reported that the serum
of a patient with focal nephritis caused C3 breakdown in
vitro at OC; this patient also had deposits of IgA, proper￾din, and C3 in the mesangium. This phenomenon was not
observed in our patients, nor was any ot-her abnormality de￾tected in a detailed examinaition of the serum complement
system.
The precise cause of IgA deposits in the mesangium in
these disorders remains uncertain. It seems likely, but ift is
not proved, that IgA is deposited as an immune-complex,
though circulating immune-complexes have not been detec￾ted in these patients. In Henoch-Schbnlein syndrome there
is circumstantial evidence favouring an allergic aetiology:
hypersensitivity,to drugs and bacterial and viral infection (in￾cluding vaccination and poliovirus inoculation) have been
implicated clinically. In idiopathic focal glomerulonephritis
there is a striking clinical association between upper respira￾tory infection and haematuria. This association and the
presence of IgA as the predominant inmunoglobulin in -the
glomerular lesions makes it tempting to speculate that im￾mune-complexes resulit from infection with an organism
such as a virus which affects a mucosal site (and therefore
provokes an IgA response).
Another possibility is that glomerular disease results from
localization of virus (or other antigenic material) in the glom￾erular mesangium. The subsequent antiibody response (which
in the case of a virus infection may be ineffective ait elim￾inating the virus) could then cause an allergic reaction at this
site. Recurrent infection, by causing a heightened antibody
response could also cause recurrent episodes of glomerular
injury manifested by haematuria. Experimental evidence sup￾porting this suggestion has recently been presented by Mauer
and his colleagues in Minneapolis (1973), who have shown
that antigenic material deposited in the mesangium can re￾act with circulating an.tibody and that the resultant allergic
reaction causes acute mesangial injury.
Whatever is the correct explanation for deposition of IgA
in the mesangium, or observations add these syndromes ito
the disorders where activation of the alternative pathway
seemns to be responsible for complemnent mediated glomerular
injury.

Induction Cardiac Pacing:
A New Approach

Summary
A new approach to induction cardiac pacing using a "skin
tunnel" transformer has been developed and used in a
patient. Initial results are encouraging. If the system
proves reliable in the long term it may have important
applications in the delivery of power to implanted arti￾ficial organs.
Introduction
Permanent electrical pacing of the heart is firmly established as
the treatment of choice in certain cardiac conditions, principally
symptomatic complete heart block. Fu1L utilization of this
method of therapy in developing countries, however, has been
impossible because of the very high cost of the permanent pace￾maker.
In seeking a less expensive alternative we have devised and
used a cheap permanent pacemaker using the induction prin￾ciple. The problem, inherent in any induction-type pacemaker
so far described, of maintenance of good approximation of
primary and secondary coils has been overcome by using a
"skin tunnel" transformer. Such a device has not been used
previously in man and its successful utilization, reported here,
may have important implications concerning the transfer of
power from outside the body to implanted artificial organs.
Principle of Method
A diagram of the system is shown in fig. 1. The induction ele￾ment is the skin tunnel transformer as described by Andren
et al. (1968). In this technique an implanted coil is brought out

in a tunnel of skin and thus can be coupled to the primary coil
with a ring of ferrite material. By using a radio frequency
impulse in our system the external coil has been reduced to one
turn of stranded copper wire and the internal coil to three turns
of insulated Elgiloy spring-coiled wire.* The latter is continuous
at one end with the pacing electrode in the heart, and at the other
with a stainless-steel capsule which acts as the indifferent
electrode and also contains the only implanted electrical com￾ponents, four diodes (only one is necessary but four are used for
redundancy) to rectify the A.C. impulse.

Clinical Trial and Results
After successful animal experiments (McArthur et al., 1972 a;
McArthur et al., 1972 b) the system was offered to a patient with
complete heart block who could not afford a totally implanted
system. An endocardial pacing lead was placed in the apex of
the right ventricle using the saphenous vein approach (Sloman
et al., 1970). Under general anaesthesia a skin tube was formed
in the inguinal fossa region using standard plastic surgery tech￾niques. Inside the tube were incorporated three loops of the
insulated Elgiloy wire, the deep portions of the loops being
placed under the external oblique muscle. The capsule was
placed in the rectus sheath. When the tube had healed a ferrox￾cube toroid,t previously scored and broken in half, was re￾assembled round it and the loop of wire from the external unit
passed through. (In fact, two loops were used for redundancy;
see fig. 2.) The external generator, which will be described
elsewhere, and which has two independent pacing circuits for
safety, was worn in a leather case on a belt (fig. 3).
