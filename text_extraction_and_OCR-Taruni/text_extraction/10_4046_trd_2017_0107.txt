formed to drain fluid, blood, or air from the pleural cavity. It 
also serves as a route to instill antibiotics (post-pneumonec￾tomy empyemas), sclerosing agents (pleurodesis), as well as 
fibrinolytics, DNAse, and/or saline (complicated parapneu￾monic effusions and empyemas). On the other hand, indwell￾ing pleural catheters (IPC) are becoming a first-line palliative 
therapy for symptomatic malignant and persistent benign 
pleural effusions. 
A recent expert consensus has stated that interventional 
pulmonology fellowships in the United States should perform 
a minimum of 20 each image-guided thoracostomy and IPC 
placement procedures annually for standard accreditation1

Consequently, pulmonologists should be familiar with the 
main indications, contraindications, technical aspects, and 
complications of inserting a chest tube in the pleural space; all 
of which will be succinctly addressed in the present review.

Chest tube insertion is a common procedure usually done for the purpose of draining accumulated air or fluid in the 
pleural cavity. Small-bore chest tubes (≤14F) are generally recommended as the first-line therapy for spontaneous 
pneumothorax in non-ventilated patients and pleural effusions in general, with the possible exception of hemothoraces 
and malignant effusions (for which an immediate pleurodesis is planned). Large-bore chest drains may be useful for 
very large air leaks, as well as post-ineffective trial with small-bore drains. Chest tube insertion should be guided by 
imaging, either bedside ultrasonography or, less commonly, computed tomography. The so-called trocar technique 
must be avoided. Instead, blunt dissection (for tubes >24F) or the Seldinger technique should be used. All chest tubes 
are connected to a drainage system device: flutter valve, underwater seal, electronic systems or, for indwelling pleural 
catheters (IPC), vacuum bottles. The classic, three-bottle drainage system requires either (external) wall suction or gravity 
(“water seal”) drainage (the former not being routinely recommended unless the latter is not effective). The optimal 
timing for tube removal is still a matter of controversy; however, the use of digital drainage systems facilitates informed 
and prudent decision-making in that area. A drain-clamping test before tube withdrawal is generally not advocated. 
Pain, drain blockage and accidental dislodgment are common complications of small-bore drains; the most dreaded 
complications include organ injury, hemothorax, infections, and re-expansion pulmonary edema. IPC represent a first￾line palliative therapy of malignant pleural effusions in many centers. The optimal frequency of drainage, for IPC, has not 
been formally agreed upon or otherwise officially established.

Chest tube drainage

Indications and Contraindications of 
Chest Tube Placement
Indications for the insertion of an intercostal chest drain are 
listed in Table 1. The most common include pneumothoraces, 
complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyemas, hemo￾thoraces, bedside pleurodesis, and following cardio-thoracic 
surgery or thoracoscopic procedures to allow for appropriate 
lung re-expansion2
. Moreover, IPC provide symptomatic relief 
in patients with large malignant effusions, benign effusions 
resistant to medical therapies, effusions which failed following 
an attempted pleurodesis, and effusions associated with unex￾pandable lungs2
.
The only absolute contraindication for tube thoracostomy 
is the lack of informed consent or patient cooperation. Rela￾tive contraindications include uncorrected coagulopathy (e.g., 
patients with international normalized ratio >1.5–2 or with 
a platelet count <50,000/µL) and instrumental access to the 
pleural cavity without image-guidance in patients with sub￾stantial pleuro-pulmonary adhesions or multiloculations3,4. 
Chest tube insertion over an infected skin area should be 
avoided. 
Chest Tube Types and Sizes
There are many kinds of chest tubes or catheters, but they 
are basically classified according to size and method of inser￾tion5
. Commercially available chest tubes are made of dif￾ferent materials, including polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, 
and silicone. They can be straight, angled, or coiled at the end 
(“pig-tail”). They contain a number of holes along the side and 
the tip, and all have a radiopaque stripe with a gap that serves 
to mark the most proximal drainage hole (“sentinel” hole). 
Some tubes have a double lumen, the small one normally be￾ing used for irrigation.
The internal diameter and length of chest tubes determine 
the air or liquid flow rate through the drain, according to the 
Poiseuille’s law (liquids) and the Fanning equation (gases)6
. 
The size of a chest tube refers to its outer diameter and is given

In a life-threatening situation, simple needle aspiration may initially provide pres￾sure relief. ‡
Occult pneumothorax is defined as air within the pleural cavity that is undetected on chest radiographs, but identified on com￾puted tomography. §
Pleurodesis should only be attempted if complete or significant lung re-expansion is achieved. ||Chest tube drainage (or 
alternatively, therapeutic thoracentesis) is a temporary conservative measure for large chylothoraces. ¶
As a first-line treatment. In patients 
with very limited life expectancy (e.g., <2 weeks), therapeutic thoracentesis may be a better option. **Heart failure and refractory hepatic hy￾drothorax are the most common etiologies which may require placement of an indwelling pleural catheter.

in “French” (F) or “Charrière” (Ch), with 1F corresponding to 
one-third millimeter. Thus, a 12F tube is 4 mm in diameter. 
Chest tube sizes usually range between 8F and 36F (Figure 1). 
A general distinction is made between small-bore chest tube 
(SBCT) and large-bore chest tube (LBCT), but the threshold 
size to establish this categorization is being set at either 14F 
or 20F7,8. For the purpose of this review, SBCT are defined as 
14F or less, and LBCT as greater than 14F, unless otherwise 
indicated. Within this categorization, some authors also prefer 
to consider a group of medium-bore tubes (16–24F)2,3. IPC is 
a fenestrated silicone 15.5F catheter, 66 cm in length with side 
holes over the distal 24 cm, which is tunneled to prevent dis￾lodgment and infection (Figure 2). 
The optimal chest tube size for the management of pleural 
diseases is still a matter of debate. The British Thoracic Soci￾ety guidelines suggest that in pneumothoraces and effusions 
of a malignant or an infectious nature (including empyemas) 
SBCT are usually adequate9-11, although there is a lack of 
randomized trial data. However, the Therapeutic Interven￾tions in Malignant Effusion (TIME1) randomized controlled 
trial found that 12F chest tubes were associated with a higher 
pleurodesis failure than 24F chest tubes (30% vs. 24%) in 100 
patients with malignant effusions, suggesting that chest tube 
size matters for pleurodesis efficacy12. Moreover, even though 
the smaller chest tubes resulted in significantly less pain than 
the larger ones, the difference was not likely clinically signifi￾cant (mean visual analog scale of 22 vs. 26.8)12. Based upon 
expert opinion, use of chest tubes ≥20F is recommended in 
the following situations2,3,5,13: (1) there is clinical concern for 
the presence of an on-going air leak (or significant risk of it, as 
in traumatic pneumothorax or bronchial dehiscence), (2) iat￾rogenic pneumothorax from barotrauma (mechanical ventila￾tion), (3) hemothoraces, and (4) postoperative drainage of the 
chest cavity. 
Techniques for Chest Tube Placement
SBCT and medium-bore chest tubes are typically placed 
using the Seldinger technique, whereas LBCT (>24F) can be 
inserted by blunt dissection or the trocar technique. The Seld￾inger technique has become the most widespread method of 
tube placement because of the ease of insertion and increased 
patient comfort14. Conversely, the trocar technique is obsolete 
and should never be employed since it significantly increases 
the risk of misplaced drains and organ perforation15.
The insertion of a chest tube can be performed at the bed￾side or the endoscopic suite for most patients, with the excep￾tion of those which are placed after cardio-thoracic surgery. 
A single chest tube is sufficient for most drainage indications, 
but occasionally two simultaneous or consecutive tubes may 
be necessary for the effective drainage of non-communicating 
infected fluid collections following a trial of intrapleural fibri￾nolytics.
1. Preparation, patient positioning, and local anesthesia
After an explanation of the advantages and possible com￾plications of the procedure, patients should give written 
informed consent, except in emergency situations. A recent 
chest radiograph should be available to the operator. The 
administration of prophylactic antibiotics prior to chest tube 
placement (e.g., a single dose of cefazolin 2 g intravenously) 
is only recommended in patients with penetrating chest in￾juries16. In addition to local anesthesia, conscious sedation

with an opioid (e.g., 2.5 mg morphine intravenously, fentanyl) 
or benzodiazepine (e.g., 1–2 mg midazolam intravenously) 
might be considered when inserting LBCT in anxious patients 
who are hemodynamically stable5,17.
The first step involves positioning the patient according to 
the location chosen for drain insertion. Ideally, chest tubes 
should be inserted at the 4th–5th intercostal space in the ante￾rior or mid-axillary line. To access this area, the patient is posi￾tioned supine, lying on the bed at 45°–60°, slightly rotated, and 
with the ipsilateral arm behind the neck or over the head14,17. 
The lateral decubitus position with the affected hemithorax 
upmost is also possible, but many times it is not tolerated by 
patients with massive pleural effusions. If the patient has a 
posterior loculated fluid collection (e.g., empyema), he/she 
will be in a seated position with the physician standing behind. 
Finally, in patients with pneumothorax, the second intercostal 
space in the mid-clavicular line (Monaldi position) has long 
been suggested as an alternative site5
. However, it is not the 
best choice because the incision is in a very visible location 
with the potential for leaving an unsightly scar, the intercostal 
space is narrow in this site, and it requires penetrating the pec￾toralis muscle. Consequently, only if very thin catheters (8F) 
are used can this insertion point be considered an acceptable 
option, particularly in apical or anterior pneumothoraces.
Bedside ultrasound (US) should be used to mark the entry 
point for all chest tubes in patients with pleural effusions in 
order to prevent incorrect placement and reduce risk of ac￾cidental organ injury associated with the procedure18. It is 
common to insert the drain using the so-called free-hand 
technique, where the physician marks the entry point under 
US guidance and the procedure is performed immediately 
thereafter while the patient remains motionless. Procedures 
where the radiologist marks the puncture location and the 
physician performs the tube thoracotomy procedure at a later 
point (“X marks the spot” technique) are highly discouraged, 
since it is nearly impossible for the patient to assume the same 
position they were in when being marked18. Real-time imag￾ing, using US or computed tomography, may be necessary 
when inserting drains into small or anatomically difficult-to￾access effusions. Experienced US operators may detect vul￾nerable intercostal vessels using a linear probe, thus avoiding 
accidental puncture of an intercostal artery.
Chest tube insertion is a full aseptic technique; therefore, 
sterile gloves, gowns, surgical mask, and drapes should be 
used. Skin disinfection with 10% povidone-iodine or 2% 
chlorhexidine solutions is confined to the target area, and 
swabbing from the point of insertion outwardly in a circular 
motion is recommended17. Once sterile drapes are arranged, 
local anesthetic infiltration of the skin, subcutaneous tissue 
(25G needle) and parietal pleura (21G needle) with 1% or 2% 
mepivacaine (or alternatively, 1% or 2% lidocaine) should be 
performed. When air or fluid is aspirated, the needle is with￾drawn until it ceases; then, further local anesthetic is injected, 
thus allowing an effective infiltration of the parietal pleura. Im￾portantly, a previous history of allergy or hypersensitivity reac￾tions to local anesthetics should be recorded before their ad￾ministration. Moreover, not infrequently an excessive quantity 
of local anesthetic produces transitory central nervous system 
(e.g., drowsiness, confusion, convulsions, focal neurological 
findings)19 and cardiovascular toxicities (e.g., hypotension, ar￾rhythmias). Total infiltration of up to 20 mL of 2% mepivacaine 
or 2% lidocaine is admissible.
A detailed stepwise description of the techniques for chest 
tube insertion is beyond the scope of this article. Regardless of 
the adopted techniques, the tube must be placed on the supe￾rior rib margin to avoid injury to the intercostal neuromuscu￾lar bundle.
2. Small-bore chest tubes (Seldinger technique)
SBCT are commonly placed using the catheter-over-guide 
wire (Seldinger) technique, in which a guide wire is inserted 
into the pleural space through an introducer needle; the wire 
should pass without resistance. Then, the needle is removed 
and dilators are threaded over the wire using a slight twisting 
action. Afterwards, the chest tube is threaded over the guide 
wire and into the pleural space, where remains14,17. In cases 
of pneumothorax, SBCT are directed toward the apex, but for 
pleural effusions they are directed both inferiorly and posteri￾orly into the diaphragmatic recess. A silk or synthetic mono￾filament suture (number 1) along with an adhesive dressing 
secure the tube in position. An attached 3-way stopcock con￾nects the tube with the drainage system. A chest radiography 
to confirm the chest tube position is mandatory.
Advantages of SBCT include the need for a small incision 
(resulting in minimal scarring), less painful insertion, and 
better tolerability by the patient. However, lumen blockage is 
a concern, making it advisable to flush 20 mL of saline every 
8–12 hours as a preventative20.
3. Large-bore chest tubes (blunt dissection technique)
Blunt dissection is the standard technique for inserting 
LBCT. It requires an incision of the skin and subcutaneous tis￾sue large enough to allow the introduction of a finger into the 
pleural space in order to avoid or break down pleuro-pulmo￾nary adhesions and ensure proper chest tube positioning17,20. 
Before finger insertion, an artery forceps or Kelly clamp must 
be used to bluntly dissect the intercostal tissues. The skin inci￾sion should be made a couple of centimeters below the upper 
rib edge through which the pleural space will be accessed, 
thus permitting the creation of a tunnel of subcutaneous tissue 
which helps to prevent air re-entry once the tube is removed 
(coulisse effect)5
. The chest tube should be held in place using 
heavy suture material (silk number 0 or 1). An additional “U￾stitch” is commonly placed around the tube, and tied to close 

JM Porcel

the wound after the tube is removed. As for SBCT, a chest 
radiograph should be obtained to check for proper position￾ing, except chest tubes placed post-operatively. The sentinel 
hole should be at least 2 cm beyond the rib margin. Although 
LBCT are less susceptible to clogging or kinking than SBCT, 
they represent a more invasive approach. 
4. Indwelling pleural catheters
IPC insertion entails the subcutaneous tunneling of the 
catheter between two incisions (about 5 cm apart). A poly￾ester cuff is placed half way along this tunneled part and acts 
as a barrier to infection and promotes adhesion to the subcu￾taneous tissue to secure the catheter in place (Figure 2). The 
pleural space is accessed using the Seldinger technique with a 
Teflon “peel-away” dilator. With the fenestrated portion of the 
catheter inside the thoracic cavity, the external portion con￾tains a one-way valve that allows fluid and air to go out, but 
not in, once attached to a vacuum bottle21. There are three IPC 
manufacturers: PleurX (CareFusion) which continues to be 
the industry standard, Rocket IPC Pleural Catheter, and Aspira 
Pleural Drainage System (Bard).
The procedure is usually performed in an ambulatory, day 
care setting, unless the patient has already been admitted for 
another reason22. It is recommended to prescribe adequate 
analgesia (e.g., acetaminophen plus a weak opioid) for at least 
two weeks following the IPC placement23. Intermittent pleural 
fluid drainage is done at home by a trained family member or 
a healthcare provider.
Chest Drainage Systems
Once a chest tube is in place, a chest drainage system (CDS) 
is attached. There are basically four types of CDS: one-way 
Heimlich valve, analog three-container systems, digital or elec￾tronic CDS, and simple vacuum bottles (for IPC drainage)5
.
1. Heimlich valve
The one-way Heimlich valve is a simple device which 
contains a rubber flutter valve that is occluded during inspi￾ration (negative intrapleural and intratube pressure), thus 
preventing air from entering the pleural space; while being 
held open during expiration (positive pleural pressure) allow￾ing the egress of air or fluid from the pleural space (Figure 3). 
Heimlich valves are used for the ambulatory management of 
pneumothorax (including patients with persistent air leaks) or 
tension pneumothoraces24. There are commercially available 
8F catheters coupled with a self contained one-way valve and 
vent, which allows full patient mobility during treatment of 
pneumothorax (e.g., Rocket Pleural Vent). 
2. Three-compartment chest drainage systems
Three-chamber plastic units (e.g., Pleur-evac, Atrium) are 
probably the most commonly used CDS25. They include a col￾lection chamber, a water-seal chamber and a suction control 
chamber, which are interconnected. Fluid or air drain into the 
collection chamber. The water-seal chamber holds a column 
of water (2 cm) which prevents air from being sucked into the 
pleural space with inspiration. Finally, the suction chamber 
may use a wet (water column) or a dry (valve regulator) suc￾tion mechanism that allows the suction level to be adjusted 
for up to –40 cm H2O for the dry device versus a maximum 
of –25 cm for water columns; –20 cm H2O being the typical 
initial pre-set level (Figure 4). This suction chamber can be at￾tached to continuous wall (external) suction to remove air or 
fluid, or it can be placed on “water seal” with no active suction 
mechanism (gravity drainage).
Intermittent or constant bubbling within the water-seal 
chamber is indicative of an air leak, which is often more ap￾parent when the patient coughs. Causes of bubbling other 
than a visceral pleural tear include a migrated tube with drain￾age holes outside the skin, or an inadequate closure of the 
chest tube insertion site. Moreover, patency of the chest tube 
is verified by observing respiratory fluctuations of the fluid in 
the water-seal chamber when the patient is on gravity drain￾age; no fluctuation indicates that either the tube is occluded or 
the lung is completely expanded and has blocked the holes of 
the chest tube inside the chest cavity. Swinging of the fluid in 
the collecting tube during respiratory cycles (“tiding”) is also 
characteristic of a correctly placed chest tube.
Whether to apply “suction or no suction” (with “suction” 
meaning external suction, and “no suction” meaning water 
seal) is a decision to be made individually6
. It is prudent to 
Figure 3. Heimlich valve.

Chest tube drainage

start with water seal in patients with pneumothoraces, pleural 
effusions, or following lung resection surgery (not lung reduc￾tion surgery or pneumonectomy). Only if an air leak persists 
or the lung does not completely re-expand should suction be 
applied. When using water seal (as opposed to digital drain￾age systems), it is mandatory to keep the canister positioned 
below the chest.
In the case of massive pleural effusions, the initial drainage 
should be controlled to prevent re-expansion pulmonary ede￾ma. It is necessary to clamp the tube if the patient develops 
respiratory symptoms (i.e., coughing, chest tightness or pain, 
shortness of breath or oxygen desaturation) or recommended 
after draining 1.5 L26. Drainage may be interrupted for up to 
one hour or more, or until symptoms resolve, and then re￾sumed. 
3. Digital drainage systems
Digital drainage systems (e.g., Thopaz, Medela; Atmos; 
Dentrex, Redax) are gradually becoming used in pneumotho￾races and following thoracic surgery (Figure 5). These devices 
reduce inter-observer variability in air leak assessment since 
they provide a continuous digital recording of air leak, fluid 
drainage and intrapleural pressure5,27. They maintain a pre￾determined intrathoracic pressure (usually –8 cm H2O), and 
the system intervenes only as needed to achieve the desired 
value. Digital systems give the patient the freedom to am￾bulate without being attached to wall suction. Overall, these 
electronic systems contribute to shortening hospital stay by 
leading to earlier chest tube removal. Moreover, patients can 
be discharged with these devices in place, if necessary.
4. Vacuum bottles
Drainage of pleural fluid through an IPC is performed by 
connecting the external one-way valve to a vacuum bottle. 
The latter is supplied by the IPC manufacturer (1 L capacity) 
or, alternatively, Redon disposable drainage vacuum bottles 
(200, 400, and 600 mL capacity) may be employed (Figure 
6). Instead of using vacuum bottles for pleural drainage, the 
Aspira catheter uses a manual pump, which is attached to the 
catheter and a collection bag in line28. The patient squeezes 
the pump to initiate the vacuum effect and the fluid drains 
into the collection bag.

The first drainage session should generally avoid removal 
of more than 1.5 L (or less if drainage causes chest pain or 
cough secondary to unexpandable lung), as detailed previ￾ously. Thereafter, there are no data to guide optimal drainage 
frequency26. It usually varies from once daily to 2 to 3 times 
weekly or may even be tailored to the patient’s symptoms. A 
recently completed randomized controlled trial favored daily 
over alternate IPC drainage in that it led to a higher rate of 
spontaneous pleurodesis (47% vs. 24%) in a shorter period (54 
vs. 90 days)29.
Chest Tube Removal
Most chest tubes are suitable for leaving inside the pleural 
space for more than 2 weeks. However, the longer the tube 
remains, the greater the risk of local infectious complications. 
On the other hand, aspiration drain systems designed for 
therapeutic thoracenteses (8F), which may occasionally be 
used for draining small empyematous collections, are usually 
made of polyurethane and should be removed no later than 
three days after their initial insertion5
.
Chest tubes are withdrawn when they reach their pre￾defined therapeutic goals or become nonfunctional. In pa￾tients with pneumothoraces or following thoracic surgery, 
a clamping trial and a chest radiograph are unnecessary 
prior to removal of tube thoracostomy to detect recurrent 
pneumothorax, provided a digital recording drainage device 
shows that the patient has no air leaks30. Acceptable air flows 
for chest tube removal are below 20 mL/min for 8–12 hours 
when no suction is applied, or less than 40 mL/min for 6 hours 
in accordance with other authors5,31. However, when conven￾tional analogue pleural drainage devices are employed, the 
chest tube is pulled out if the lung remains fully expanded 
on a chest radiograph performed off suction, and no air bub￾bling in the water seal chamber is observed. A bubbling chest 
tube should never be clamped, since this may lead to tension 
pneumothorax. If doubts on the presence of an air leak exist, 
some clinicians prefer to perform a clamp trial, a risky maneu￾ver that requires close monitoring of the patient and generally 
leads to unneeded delay of chest tube removal5
.
In cases of pleural effusion, the fluid output threshold for 
chest drain removal is not standardized and depends on the 
underlying disease. In postoperative situations, chest tubes 
can be safely withdrawn with daily outputs up to 450 mL/24 
hr31. Following pleurodesis, some pulmonologists remove the 
drain when fluid production is below 100–150 mL/day while 
others do it at a specific time (e.g., 24 hours) after the instil￾lation of the sclerosing agent, regardless of fluid volume out￾put32.
In preparation for removal, the tube should be taken off suc￾tion, placed on water seal and removed quickly at the end of 
expiration during a Valsalva maneuver while placing a sterile 
dressing over the insertion site31. After suturing the opening, 
an occlusive dressing with povidone-iodine is applied to the 
wound.
In IPC patients, when the pleural fluid output drops to less 
than 50 mL on three consecutive drainages, spontaneous 
pleurodesis is assumed21, provided a bedside US rules out the 
presence of pleural fluid (i.e., the declined drainage cannot be 
attributed to catheter blockage). In these circumstances the 
pleural catheter may be removed. Spontaneous pleurodesis 
occurs in about 50% of patients26. For IPC withdrawal, the ad￾hesions surrounding the cuff need to be freed, usually with a 
metallic groove director.
Complications
The average rate of complications during or following place￾ment of a chest tube is less than 10% (Table 2), and mainly 
depends on operator experience, the size of the tube and use 
of imaging to guide insertion33-35. Fewer complications appear 
when experienced operators insert SBCT under image guid￾ance. In a British audit of 58 hospitals, 824 chest drain proce￾dures were evaluated, of which 83% corresponded to SBCT, 
80% made use of the Seldinger technique, and about half were 
performed under real-time US36. The most frequent immedi￾ate complications were pain (4.1%), failure to place the drain 
(2.4%) and vasovagal reactions (2.1%), while delayed compli￾cations included pain (18%), drain blockage (7.4%), accidental 
dislodgment (7.3%), and subcutaneous emphysema (3.4%)36. 
As far as LBCT (≥20F) is concerned, commonly reported post￾insertion complications are malposition (6.5%), drain block￾age (5.2%), organ injuries (1.4%), and empyema (1.4%)20.

Chest tube malpositions can be classified as intrafissural, 
intraparenchymal, and subcutaneous. They should be initially 
suspected if the chest tube is not draining, and are supported 
by chest radiographic findings. But often, a computed tomog￾raphy is necessary to better assess malpositioned tubes. In 
cases of intraparenchymal misplacement, a second function￾ing chest tube should be placed prior to the removal of the 
original to avoid tension pneumothorax or extensive subcuta￾neous emphysema34. Rather than being reintroduced, any dis￾lodged nonfunctional tube should be replaced, due to the risk 
of infection associated with the reinsertion of the externalized 
portion of the tube.
Hemothorax may result from intercostal artery laceration 
or, less commonly, from injury to vascularized pleural tumors. 
Although this complication is usually evident during or after 
the procedure, sometimes bleeding remains undetected due 
to the tamponade effect of the chest tube itself until the drain 
is removed33,34.
Subcutaneous emphysema involving chest wall, neck, and 
face presents as a subcutaneous crepitation, and is easily de￾tectable on chest radiographs. Fortunately, it is usually a minor 
and self-limiting complication. Tube blockade or migration of 
the sentinel hole out of the pleural space should be checked. 
This complication may need tube thoracostomy replacement 
and even subcutaneous incisions or drains. 
Complications associated with IPC use occur in 10%–20% 
of patients26. Many are common for any chest tube drain, 
as referred to above, though others are more specific to this 
procedure. IPC blockage and symptomatic loculations (i.e., 
a multiseptated effusion which fails to evacuate through a 
patent IPC) may require intrapleural fibrinolysis. IPC-related 
infection develops in about 5% of the cases and remains the 
strongest concern26. However, the infections are generally 
mild and can often be managed conservatively (e.g., antibiot￾Table 2. Complications of chest drain insertion

Conclusion
Tube thoracostomy is a procedure which can be performed 
by trained pulmonologists. Other than postoperative chest 
tubes, most procedures consist of the US-guided insertion of 
SBCT with the Seldinger technique in patients with pneumo￾thoraces, complicated parapneumonic effusions/empyemas, 
or malignant pleural effusions. Hemothoraces usually require 
LBCT, which can be placed by Seldinger or blunt dissection 
techniques. Detection of air leaks in patients with pneumotho￾races or following thoracic surgery has been greatly improved 
with the use of electronic CDS. Finally, IPC are becoming a 
first-line therapy of symptomatic malignant and persistent 
benign pleural effusions. They are commonly placed as a day 
case and allow long-term intermittent fluid drainage in the 
outpatient setting. Pulmonologists should be familiar with 
the common complications that may occur during or after 
chest tube insertion, some of which are potentially dangerous 
(e.g., malposition, hemothorax, infection, organ injury, or re￾expansion pulmonary edema).
