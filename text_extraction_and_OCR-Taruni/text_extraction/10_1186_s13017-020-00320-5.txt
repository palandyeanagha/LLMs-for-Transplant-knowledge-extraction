Abstract
Background: Since its first documentation, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has emerged worldwide,
with the consequent declaration of a pandemic disease (COVID-19). Severe forms of acute respiratory failure can
develop. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may affect organs other than the lung, such as the liver, with frequent onset of
late cholestasis. We here report the histological findings of a COVID-19 patient, affected by a tardive complication
of acute ischemic and gangrenous cholecystitis with a perforated and relaxed gallbladder needing urgent surgery.
Case presentation: A 59-year-old Caucasian male, affected by acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2
infection was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the severity of the disease, invasive mechanical
ventilation was instituted and SARS-CoV-2 treatment (azithromycin 250 mg once-daily and hydroxychloroquine 200
mg trice-daily) started. Enoxaparin 8000 IU twice-daily was also administered subcutaneously. At day 8 of ICU
admission, the clinical condition improved and patient was extubated. At day 32, patient revealed abdominal pain
without signs of peritonism at examination, with increased inflammatory and cholestasis indexes at blood tests. At
a first abdominal CT scan, perihepatic effusion and a relaxed gallbladder with dense content were detected. The
surgeon decided to wait and see the evolution of clinical conditions. The day after, conditions further worsened
and a laparotomic cholecystectomy was performed. A relaxed and perforated ischemic gangrenous gallbladder,
with a local tissue inflammation and perihepatic fluid, was intraoperatively met. The gallbladder and a sample of
omentum, adherent to the gallbladder, were also sent for histological examination.
Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides display inflammatory infiltration and endoluminal obliteration of vessels, with wall
breakthrough, hemorrhagic infarction, and nerve hypertrophy of the gallbladder.
The mucosa of the gallbladder appears also atrophic. Omentum vessels also appear largely thrombosed.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrates an endothelial overexpression of medium-size vessels (anti-CD31), while not
in micro-vessels, with a remarkable activity of macrophages (anti-CD68) and T helper lymphocytes (anti-CD4)

Background
In late December 2019, clusters of patients with intersti￾tial pneumonia of unknown cause have been reported by
some local health facilities in Wuhan (China). On Janu￾ary 7, the Chinese Center for Disease Control identified
a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1], consequently de￾clared a pandemic disease (COVID-19) by the World
Health Organization on March 11.
COVID-19 mainly affects male patients (around 60%),
with a median age of about 50 years; 40% of patients de￾velops a severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), 5% requir￾ing intensive care [2, 3]. COVID-19 is also characterized
by a high intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate of about
26%, with a death rate higher among older patients [4].
The most common symptoms are fever followed by
dry cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, fa￾tigue, and myalgia [5]. Less common symptoms include
headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sputum
production, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting [5].
Approximately 75% of patients show bilateral pneumo￾nia [6]. Different from other coronavirus infections,
COVID-19 has a greater preference for infecting the
lower respiratory tract, with severe forms of ARF com￾plicated by shock and acute organ failures [5, 6].
Very recently, a case series have reported that liver in￾jury is a frequent, although transient and non-severe
complication of COVID-19. Authors reported that late
cholestasis was frequently observed, while synthetic
function was preserved. They hypothesized that chole￾stasis may be associated to several factors, such as in￾flammation, parenteral nutrition, or drug toxicity [7].
We report, for the first time, the histological findings of
a COVID-19 patient, affected by a tardive complication
of acute ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis with a perfo￾rated and relaxed gallbladder needing urgent surgery.
Case presentation
On March 24, a 59-year-old Caucasian male (78 kg of ac￾tual body weight, 175 cm of height) was admitted to a per￾ipherical hospital for progressive respiratory symptoms. In
the 12 days preceding hospital admission, the patient re￾ported fever and sore throat. Due to the medical history, a
nasal and pharyngeal swab was performed and SARS￾CoV-2 infection confirmed. Interleuchin-6 (IL-6) was
2110 pg/mL (normal range < 7 pg/mL). Intravenous toci￾lizumab 600 mg was immediately administered. Twelve
hours after the first dose, physicians did not observe clin￾ical and/or blood test improvements, so they decided to
administer a second dose.
The patient’s condition progressively worsened, and he
was transferred to our tertiary-level ICU. At the arrival,
the patient was awake and conscious; he was spontan￾eously breathing through Venturi mask, with a respira￾tory rate > 30 breaths/min; the oxygen arterial partial
pressure (PaO2) to inspired fraction (FiO2) ratio (PaO2/
FiO2) was 163 mmHg at the arterial blood gases (ABGs).
Hemodynamics were initially stable, with a mean arterial
blood pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg. Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 11.
Therefore, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
through helmet in combination with prone position was
firstly attempted [8]. All routine microbiological cultures
(blood, urine, and surveillance for multidrug-resistant bac￾teria) were also collected. However, due to the lack of
ABGs improvement after 2 h and presence of respiratory
distress and tachypnea, we decided for immediate intub￾ation and protective invasive mechanical ventilation
(iMV), in volume-controlled mode, with continuous infu￾sion of rocuronium 0.6 mg*kg/h [9]. Despite fluid resusci￾tation, MAP was < 65 mmHg, deeming necessary the
administration of norepinephrine at 0.30 mcg/kg/min.
After 1 h of iMV, ABGs showed a moderate alteration of
oxygenation with a PaO2/FiO2 of 186 mmHg.
Blood test at admission and along the first 3 weeks of
ICU stay are reported in Table 1. A general inflamma￾tory status with an acute injury of the liver and kidney,
and an abnormal increase of cardiac and muscular en￾zymes (in absence of electrocardiogram alterations) were
observed. At ICU admission, IL-6 was 1704 pg/mL, des￾pite treatment with tocilizumab. Microbiological cultures
resulted positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida
albicans in rectal and pharyngeal swabs, respectively.
Intravenous empiric antimicrobial therapy was started with
meropenem 1 g thrice-daily and linezolid 600 mg twice-daily,
in addition to SARS-CoV-2 treatment with azithromycin
250 mg once-daily and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg trice￾daily. Enoxaparin 8000 IU twice-daily was administered sub￾cutaneously. Despite it, thrombosis of jugular and femoral
veins occurred, without signs of pulmonary embolism along
the ICU stay. Prone position was also performed during
iMV. Due to worsening of kidney function, continuous renal
replacement therapy was performed.
Bruni et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:43 Page 2 of 8

At day 8 of ICU admission, blood test and gas ex￾change significantly improved and the patient was extu￾bated and weaned off from iMV through helmet non￾invasive ventilation (NIV) [10] in a proportional mode to
improve patient-ventilator interaction and to increase
the rate of success [11–14]. After 48 h, weaning from
NIV was performed with high-flow oxygen through
nasal cannula, to unload respiratory muscles and provide
heated and humidified air-oxygen admixture [15–17].
In the next days, patients continued renal replacement
therapy and a low dose of vasoactive agent (norepineph￾rine < 0.3 mcg/kg/min) due to hypotension. At day 15,
WBC count increased with occurrence of fever (>
38.5 °C), due to a catheter-related bloodstream infection
due to a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus;
antimicrobial therapy was initiated with linezolid 600
mg twice-daily for ten consecutive days.
At day 32, the patient revealed abdominal pain without
signs of peritonism at examination. At blood tests, white
blood cells (18.94 n/mL), procalcitonin (2.73 ng/mL),
and cholestasis indexes rapidly increased. Empiric anti￾biotic therapy was reinstituted with meropenem 1 g
trice-daily and tigecycline 50 mg twice-daily. The ab￾dominal CT scan (Toshiba Aquilon 64 Slices, Toshiba,
Tokyo, Japan) detected perihepatic effusion and a re￾laxed gallbladder with dense content (Fig. 1a). Surgical
consultancy was required, and the consultant suggested
to wait and see the evolution of clinical conditions. The
day after (day 33), blood tests further worsened, as well
as symptoms. Based on a second abdominal CT scan
showing increased perihepatic effusion (Fig. 1b), sur￾geons decided for a laparotomic cholecystectomy;
laparotomy was preferred over laparoscopy to limit
virus spread according to the internal protocol,
although not clearly demonstrated by the literature
[18]. A relaxed and perforated gallbladder, with a
local tissue inflammation and perihepatic fluid, was
intraoperatively met. Gallbladder and a sample of
omentum, adherent to gallbladder, were also sent for
histological examination.

During surgery, swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2
were performed on perihepatic fluid, bile, and rectum.
All swabs resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Nasopharyngeal swabs were also negative. The day after
surgery, the patient was extubated and he progressively
improved till day 44, when he was discharged to a
COVID-19 ward.
Histological and immunohistochemistry methods
The histological diagnosis was made on hematoxylin￾eosin-stained slides. A three-layer biotin-avidin￾peroxidase system was utilized to appraise endothelial
cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes CD4+ (helper) [19–
21]. Briefly, 4-μm thick serial sections of formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded samples were deparaffinized.
Afterward, sections were microwaved at 500 W for 10 min
for antigen retrieval and endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Slides
were subsequently incubated with (1) monoclonal anti￾bodies anti-CD31 (clone JC70A; DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark), diluted at 1:40 for 30 min at room temperature
and pH 8, to identify endothelial cells; (2) monoclonal
antibodies anti-CD68 (Clone KP1; DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark), diluted at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature
and pH 8, to identify tissue macrophages; and (3) mono￾clonal antibodies anti-CD4 (Clone 4B12; DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark) diluted at 1:100 for 20 min at temperature of
97 °C and pH 8, to identify lymphocytes CD4+
.
The bound antibody was visualized using DAB
Chromogen brown secondary antibody (3,3′-diamino￾benzidine, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Nuclear coun￾terstaining was performed with Gill’s hematoxylin no. 2
(Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA).
Morphometrical assay
Serial sections of each sampled tissue were evaluated
through light microscopy integrated with an image ana￾lysis system (Olympus, BX53M, Tokyo, Japan). In tissue
sections, five most immunostained areas (hot spots)
were selected at low (× 2/0.08 NA) magnification; details
were then evaluated at high magnification (× 10-40/0.40
NA). In case of cell aggregates, immune cells were iden￾tified through immunostaining, presence of perinuclear
cytoplasmatic area, and blue staining of the nucleus.
Histological findings
As shown in Fig. 2, hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides dis￾play the inflammatory infiltration and endoluminal
Fig. 2 Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the gallbladder. Inflammatory infiltrates diffusely involve medium-size arteries, with obliteration of
their lumen. These features indicate vasculitis with thrombosis. a Lumen obliterated by inflammatory cells with wall breakthrough is indicated by
a red arrow, while normal lumen by a black arrow (magnification × 2/0.08 NA); a further magnification of the tissue is represented in c
(magnification × 40/0.40 NA). b The black arrow indicates an ischemic obliteration, while the red arrow highlights the presence of nerve
hypertrophy (magnification × 2/0.08 NA). d The gallbladder mucosa appears to be atrophic (red arrow); two glands are indicated by black arrows
(magnification × 2/0.08 NA)
Bruni et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:43 Page 4 of 8

obliteration of vessels, with wall breakthrough,
hemorrhagic infarction (Fig. 2a and b, black arrow), and
nerve hypertrophy of the gallbladder (Fig. 2b, red arrow).
In Fig. 2c, a detail of Fig. 2a at high (× 40/0.40 NA)
magnification highlights inflammatory infiltrates with
wall breakthrough. In Fig. 2d, the mucosa of the gall￾bladder appears also atrophic (red arrow), while glands
are few, although normal (black arrows).
Figure 3 shows the involvement of the omentum in
the disease process; in particular, omentum vessels ap￾pear largely thrombosed (red arrows), while adipose tis￾sue being normal (black arrow).
Figure 4 shows immunohistochemical findings relative
to anti-CD31 (Fig. 4a and b), anti-CD68 (Fig. 4c and d),
and anti-CD4 antibodies (Fig. 4e and f) at low and high
magnification. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates an
endothelial overexpression of medium-size vessels (anti￾CD31), while not in micro-vessels, with a remarkable ac￾tivity of macrophages (anti-CD68) and T helper lympho￾cytes (anti-CD4) against gallbladder vessels. All these
findings define a histological diagnosis of vasculitis of
the gallbladder.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
histopathological findings of an acute ischemic gangren￾ous cholecystitis as a tardive complication in a patient
affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the presence of a viral
protein Spike (commonly referred to as “S”) that inter￾acts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor
(ACE2) in the host [22]. ACE2 is a protein highly
expressed in the lungs, intestine, oral mucosa, and liver.
The expression of ACE2 in the liver can explain the de￾velopment of liver injury characterized by a reversible
increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), which mainly occurs in the first
week of the disease [23]. However, it remains under de￾bate if SARS-CoV-2 is directly responsible of the liver
injury, or whether the liver damage is secondary to the
systemic inflammatory response of COVID-19. In
addition, during COVID-19 the development of the liver
injury might also due secondary to tissue hypoxia or
drug-induced toxicity [23].
In our patient, we report the presence of overexpres￾sion of endothelial cells in medium-size vessels (while
not in microvessels), vascular lumen obliteration by in￾flammatory cells with wall breakthrough, thrombosed
vessels, and hemorrhagic infarction of the gallbladder. In
fact, expression of endothelial cells could trigger a cyto￾kine storm which recruits macrophages and causes in￾flammatory reactions, similar to those of vasculitis, and
the activation of a thrombophilic status [24]. Indeed,
SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates the expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and tumor ne￾crosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). In case of severe inflamma￾tory response, both IL-6 and TNF-α activate the
coagulation cascade [25, 26], explaining the presence of
thrombosed vessels in the gallbladder and the occur￾rence of an ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis. A similar
pattern of the thrombosed vessel has been found also in
the omentum. Of note, diffused thrombosis occurred
also in the jugular and femoral veins, despite the
prophylactic high dose of enoxaparin.
Interestingly, in a case series of 7 critically ill adults af￾fected by COVID-19 was reported the occurrence of
acro-ischemia lesions including finger/toe cyanosis, skin
bulla, and dry gangrene [27]. In 4 out of 7 patients, dis￾seminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diag￾nosed [27]. In another report from Wuhan, 71.4% of
dead COVID-19 patients showed evidence of overt DIC
[28]. The dysregulation of coagulation and the urokinase
pathway was already reported by Gralinski et al. during
the coronavirus SARS disease that emerged in 2002 and
2003 [29]. More recently, in three patients affected by
COVID-19, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies
was reported, which may lead also to thrombotic events
[30]. Therefore, it is becoming clearer and clearer that
dysregulated coagulation is implicated in complication
related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
However, it remains unclear the absence of SARS￾CoV-2 detection in the multiple swabs we performed. In
keeping with previous report [31], we could not clearly
demonstrate the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection
through pharyngeal and nasal swabs. In fact, the SARS￾CoV-2 swabs may be already negative after 2 weeks,
while viral load increases over 2-3 weeks in deeper re￾spiratory secretions (such as sputum and bronchoalveo￾lar fluid), and viral shedding is prolonged in stool [32].
Fig. 3 Normal adipose tissue is represented in the omentum (black
arrow), while vessels are thrombosed (red arrows) (magnification ×
2/0.08 NA)
Bruni et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:43 Page 5 of 8

Nevertheless, rectal, perihepatic fluid, and bile swabs
were all negative. Of note, for the first time, it has been
recently reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the
peritoneal fluid, in concomitance with nasal and
pharyngeal positive swabs [33]. We cannot therefore ex￾clude that the viral shedding already occurred in our pa￾tient, leading to the hypothesis that the inflammatory
status might constantly be present, even for a certain
period after a complete viral shedding.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in our patient with a recent SARS-CoV-2 in￾fection, ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis can be a tardive
complication of COVID-19, and it is characterized by a dys￾regulated host inflammatory response and thrombosis of
medium-size vessels. Further data are deemed necessary to
confirm such observation in other cases.
