Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
In this study, IDW interpolation showed that alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is widespread throughout the world, and that it is clear 
that it is not just a disease of Caucasians from Northern Europe, but is prevalent in numerous countries throughout the world.
Background: Currently, there is a remarkable lack of genetic epidemiological studies on 
alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency in about half of the 193 countries of the World. This 
fact impedes the establishment of a true prevalence pattern of this deleterious heredi￾tary disorder in extensive regions of human population. 
Objectives: The aim of the present study was to generate detailed maps of the frequency 
distribution of the two most frequent AAT deficiency alleles (i.e., PI*S and PI*Z) in all areas 
of the World. 
Materials and Methods: Available data provided by epidemiological studies performed 
in 94 of 193 countries worldwide was used to develop detailed maps of these two alleles, 
We employed an informatics mathematical approach, namely: the ArcMap [a compo￾nent of ESRI’s ArcGIS Geographical Information System (GIS), for Microsoft Windows], 
based on the inverse distance weighting (IDW) multivariate interpolation method, 
which creates new numerical points from known data, using a simple logarithm based 
in the distance existing between them. 
Results: In this method, PI*S and PI*Z frequencies were represented by colored scales, 
where qualitative colors were converted into quantitative data, providing information 
on their distribution in all parts of the world. This approach not only confirmed our pre￾vious data, but also provided digital images of the remaining regions of all continents. 
Conclusions: By using this approach, striking differences were found among regions, 
and unsuspected significant values of the PI*S and PI*Z alleles frequencies were obtained 
for several geographic regions where have not been studied yet. In fact, some of these 
regions might be considered as priority targets for further screening studies on AAT 
deficiency, in order to identify, and properly manage, individuals at risk for the diverse 
adverse health effects associated with AAT deficiency.

1. Background 
Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a recessive he￾reditary metabolic disorder which results in the synthe￾sis and secretion of defective AAT. Up to now, about 100 
genetic variants of AAT have been recognized. Protease 
inhibitor (PI) M (medium mobility) is the normal allele, 
while the two most frequent deficient alleles are PI*S and 
PI*Z. The PI*ZZ genotype results in very low AAT serum 
concentrations (10–15%), and PI*SZ and PI*MZ phenotypes 
result in low to intermediate serum AAT concentrations 
from 35% to 70%. Other 30 variants affect the amount or 
the function of the AAT molecule, but clinically, most 
(96%) AAT deficiency-related patients are linked with the 
PI*ZZ type, and the remaining 4% to PI*SZ, null and about 
other 30 rare or null phenotypes (1, 2). Individuals who 
are homozygous for the Z allele undergo significant in￾tracellular polymerization of their AAT, showing a pro￾found suppression of their circulating plasma AAT levels. 
The retained AAT polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum 
of hepatocytes can cause liver damage, whilst the lack of 
circulating protein may promote development of COPD 
(3). The presentation of patients with severe AAT deficien￾cy differs from chronic liver disease, fulminant hepatic 
failure or adult emphysema (1-4). In infancy, the typical 
presentation is a neonatal cholestasis. Population-based 
studies indicate that 80% of these infants are healthy and 
free of chronic disease by the age of 18 years, and that the 
overall risk of life-threatening liver disease in childhood 
may be as low as 3%, but that the risk of varying degrees of 
liver dysfunction in children may range from 15% to 60%. 
Liver disease in adults may present as chronic hepatitis, 
and the risk of clinically significant disease may increase 
with advancing age (cirrhosis may be present in 30% to 
40% of elderly adults, as shown by autopsy studies). There 
is also an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma of 
unknown magnitude in PI*ZZ adults. Other uncommon 
AAT deficiency-related diseases are fibromyalgia, system￾ic vasculitis, relapsing panniculitis and bronchial asthma 
(5-8). In previous epidemiological studies, data on genet￾ic AAT deficiency from 94 of the 193 countries worldwide 
were published in the peer-reviewed medical literature 
(9-16), most of these belong to developed countries from 
Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. How￾ever, there is an important lack of AAT deficiency epide￾miological data from many other regions of the World, 
rises the erroneous concept that this genetic disorder 
is either very rare or does not exist in these unexplored 
geographic regions (17). Thus, to assess the AAT deficiency 
allelic distribution in these non-studied regions of the 
World, we used a useful method usually employed in oth￾er disciplines of the Science (such as Geography, Meteo￾rology, etc.), known as inverse distance weighting (IDW) 
multivariate interpolation (18, 19). 
2. Objectives
From the available data on PI*S and PI*Z AAT deficiency 
gene frequencies, colored maps introducing new data on 
PI*S and PI*Z frequencies were obtained in each region 
and country of the World.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Source of Genetic Epidemiological Studies for PI*S 
and PI*Z Frequencies
The articles used in the present study were obtained 
through a variety of sources which have been discussed 
in earlier publications (9, 11-16). The complete database 
comprises a total of 514 cohorts, containing 199,449 sub￾jects from 94 countries from Europe, America, Asia, Aus￾tralia and New Zealand. These 94 countries are only those 
from a possible 193 countries worldwide (https://www.
cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html) where 
there are genetic epidemiological studies available on 
AAT deficiency in the peer-reviewed medical literature. 
3.2. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) Multivariate In￾terpolation Method
In general, interpolation is a method of constructing 
new data points within the range of a set of known data 
points obtained by sampling or experimentation. Inverse 
distance weighting (IDW) is a process of assigning values 
to unknown points by using values from scattered set of 
known points. In a digital image (or bitmap) each pixel 
has a value to construct an image (18, 19). According to 
how far each grid point is away from the original cen￾ter of each pixel, the new sample point is given a color 
value. The mathematics underlying bitmap is multi￾variate interpolation in two spatial variables, and is per￾formed separately for each color channel. To elaborate 
colored geographical maps, The ArcMap “Geostatistical 
Analyst”[a component of ESRI’s ArcGIS Geographical In￾formation System (GIS)], developed as client software 
specifically for the Microsoft Windows environment, 
was employed to enable more intuitive processing and 
presentation of ArcGIS data. The “Geostatistical wizard” 
option of the ArcMap menu automatically performed a 
“nearest point method” local interpolation IDW, where 
a sample point takes the four closest pixel centers and 
linearly interpolates their color values according to their 
distances from the sample point. To show the results of

the interpolation graphically, the “Contours” (isolines) 
from the “Shape type” options was selected. To express 
the range of values in the World maps, a progressive 15 
color scale, with blue tones representing the lowest val￾ues and red tones the highest ones, was used. The large 
numbers of data existing from Europe allowed to obtain 
a more detailed map of this continent using a 20 blue to 
red color grading scale.
4. Results
Figure 1 shows a worldwide map indicating the PI*Z gene 
frequency distribution. Figure 2 focuses on the PI*Z preva￾lence distribution in Europe. Figure 3 shows the PI*S fre￾quency distribution worldwide.
4.1. Worldwide Map of PI*Z Gene Frequency Distribution
In Figure 1, black spots indicate the places where the epi￾demiological studies were conducted, and where the nu￾merical data were obtained. A colored scale with shades 
of red and orange tones representing maximal values 
(21-40 x 1000), shades of yellow and green tones repre￾senting the intermediate ones (8-20 x 1000), and shades 
of blue tones representing the minimal values (0-8 per 
1000) has been shown. The greatest number of black 
spots is located in Europe (Figure 2). In contrast, spots 
are scattered and scanty in most of the remaining parts 
of the World. In general, maximal PI*Z frequencies are in 
European coastal regions near the Atlantic Ocean and its 
seas, and they gradually decrease to the west of this con￾tinent. Specifically, maximal PI*Z frequencies (20-40 per 
1000) are found in the southern regions of the Scandi￾navian Peninsula, Denmark and Baltic Republics. Lower 
but still significantly high values of around 20 x 1000 
are found in the Low Countries (i.e., Belgium, the Neth￾erlands, Luxemburg, and parts of northern France and 
western Germany). Similar values have been found in the 
west coast of France, southern England, Ireland, south￾ern regions of Great Britain, and northwestern regions 
of the Iberian Peninsula. Isolated points of high Z fre￾quencies are also found in both the Trentino-Alto Adige/
Südtirol and Lazio regions of Italy, and in the southern 
Germany states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. In 
general, Z prevalence steadily decreases from the west 
to the east of the Continent, showing moderate values 
in some Central and Western Europe areas of Germany, 
Poland, Byelorussia, west of Ukraine, Macedonia, and the 
Black Sea coasts of Rumania and Bulgaria. PI*Z frequen￾cies are low or very low in European Russia, Balkan Penin￾sula, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, and in remote areas of the 
northern Europe, practically disappearing in Lapland, 
and the southwestern regions of the Middle East. The PI*Z 
allele is practically absent in Northern and Eastern Asia. 
However, in several regions of the Middle-East (i.e., Saudi 
Arabia), Southern Asia (i.e., Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, 
Tajikistan, and the coastal enclaves on the Arabian Sea 
coast, Daman and Diu, in Northwest India), Southeastern 
Asia (Thailand) and Maritime Southeast Asia (Malaysia) 
moderate values of the PI*Z frequency were found. Some 
regions of Eastern Africa (such as: Ethiopia, Somalia and 
Kenya) and Western Africa (i.e., Morocco, Mauritania and 
Mali) also showed moderate frequencies of PI*Z allele. In 
the remaining regions of the African Continent the PI*Z 
frequency is very low or absent. Moderate and high fre￾Figure 1. World Map of the PI*Z Gene Frequency Distribution

quencies of PI*Z were found in New Zealand, and in the 
Australian states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victo￾ria, South Australia and Tasmania. In the Americas, high 
and moderate PI*Z frequencies were found in the south￾western coast of Greenland, in several regions of Canada 
(i.e., British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, 
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and 
Labrador). In North America, high PI*Z frequencies were 
shown in those States located around the Great Lakes 
area, and also in Arizona. Moderate or low frequencies 
were found in the remaining zones of the U.S., and in 
Mexico. Moderate or low frequencies of 8-10 × 1000 were 
found in Central America, Caribbean Islands, and in most 
regions of South America. 
4.2. Distribution of PI*S Gene Frequencies Worldwide
In Figure 3 again the black spots indicate the sources 
of the data. A colored scale, with shades of red and or￾ange tones representing maximal values (63-188 × 1000), 
shades of yellow and green tones the intermediate ones 
(20-62 × 1000), and shades of blue tones the minimal 
values (0-20 per 1000), has been shown. Once more, the 
greatest number of studies was performed in Europe, 
while scanty and scattered data in many other remain￾ing geographical areas was observed. Maximal PI*S fre￾quencies were found both in Africa and Europe. Very 
high PI*S frequencies were found in the Iberian Penin￾sula, and south-western France in accordance with pre￾vious reports. Values slowly decrease to the north and 
the east of the European continent. The PI*S allele is 
practically absent in Asia, except in some isolated areas 
of Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Malaysia. Surprisingly, the 
IDW map also showed unsuspected very high frequen￾cies in extensive regions of Africa, with the highest PI*S 
frequencies worldwide found in the coastal regions of 
Middle and Southern Africa, corresponding to the politi￾cal states of Angola, Namibia, Gabon, Congo, Botswana, 
and South Africa. Very high frequencies were also found 
in the northwestern regions of Morocco, Western Sahara 
and Mauritania. High PI*S frequencies were also found 
in other several countries of Western, Northern, Middle 
and Eastern Africa regions, such as: Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, 
Libya, Uganda and Madagascar. In the Americas, high val￾ues of PI*S were found in the Ontario province of Canada, 
the Florida Peninsula in the United States, several areas 
of Central America, the Caribbean islands, and the South 
American countries of Venezuela, Chile and Uruguay. 
In Greenland, the remaining regions of Canada, U.S.A, 
Mexico, and South-America, intermediate values of PI*S 
frequency were found. Finally, moderate values of PI*S 
were found in New Zealand, and high or moderate values 
in the Australia regions of Queensland, New South Wales, 
Victoria, South Australia and in Tasmania.
5. Discussion
AAT deficiency is an underdiagnosed disorder, partly 
because it is thought to be a rare condition which practi￾cally only affects Caucasians (Whites) of Northern Euro￾pean heritage (17). Unfortunately, at present the only data 
exists, has resulted from genetic epidemiological studies 
on AAT deficiency in 94 of the 193 countries worldwide. 
However, it is suspected that such genetic epidemiologi￾cal studies have only “scratched the surface” due to the 
lack of extensive genetic epidemiological studies in coun￾tries as well as remaining areas of the World. For a first 
time, the informatics mathematical application ArcMap/ 
IDW interpolation method has provided series of colored 
maps, where qualitative colors were converted into quan￾titative data for the two more frequent AAT deficiency al￾leles (namely, PI*S and PI*Z) in all parts of the World. IDW 
interpolation consists of creating new points of values 
from known data, using a simple logarithm based in the 
distance existing between them, and currently it is a use￾ful technique in Cartography, Topography, Meteorology, 
and some others. It is usually used to estimate human 
population distributions, environment pollution, trends 
and ranges of temperatures, precipitations, snowfalls, 
fogs, atmospheric pressures, wind velocity, frequency of 
days with rainfalls, relative humidity, hours of sunshine, 
days with frost, and some other factors. The results of the 
present approach not only confirmed previously report￾ed data in countries where epidemiological data on AAT 
deficiency where obtained by studies performed “in situ” 
with real subjects, but also expanded the existing infor￾mation to non-studied zones from these same countries. 
Likewise, the IDW interpolation method provided an esti￾mation of the gene prevalence of the PI*S and PI*Z alleles 
in extensive zones of the World where epidemiological 
studies have not been conducted so far. Interestingly, 
this approach revealed the existence of intermediate 
and high values of both deficient alleles in some of these 
countries where real genetic epidemiological data is lack￾ing. In the IDW interpolation method, the weight (value) 
of the points is only assigned according to the distances 
between them, and gives a bigger weight to the values 
nearer to the true point than to the more distant ones. 
Therefore, since in our study both the data numbers and 
the distances between points were much more abundant 
and compact in Europe, the application of a local inter￾polation has provided more precise maps for this conti￾nent than for the remaining ones. In contrast, in many 
other geographical areas outside Europe, the number 
of the data points obtained by direct measurement was 
evidently lower and with longer distances among many 
of them. Thus, this fact could consequently decrease the 
prognostic reliability of our results. Nevertheless, in spite 
of these possible biasing facts, and taking into account 
all the aforementioned limitations, the present analysis 
has provided guiding estimation of the PI*S and PI*Z fre￾quency values, and has clearly demonstrated that these 
two major AAT deficient alleles are in widespread distri￾bution worldwide, and that there are substantial popula￾tions at risk for adverse health effects of AAT deficiency-

related in many countries of the World. These new data 
also indicates that AAT deficiency may constitute one of 
the most frequent human genetic diseases, and in most 
countries, individuals with phenotypes that may put 
them at risk for various environmental exposures have 
not been identified. Identification of these individuals 
with AAT deficiency seems to be critical for their manage￾ment, education and treatment. In summary, the IDW in￾terpolation has demonstrated to be a useful method for 
obtaining some information about AAT deficiency gene 
distribution and possible numbers of deficiency subjects 
in regions lacking real data on this subject. Evidently, 
this information might be improved by means of further 
epidemiological studies in countries lacking studies on 
AAT deficiency. Moreover, IDW interpolation could also 
provide valuable information on other different epide￾miological aspects and disciplines of the medicine. In 
our study, its application specifically showed that AAT 
deficiency is widespread throughout the world, and that 
it is clear that it is not just a disease of Caucasians from 
Northern Europe, while is prevalent in many different 
races in numerous countries throughout the World.
