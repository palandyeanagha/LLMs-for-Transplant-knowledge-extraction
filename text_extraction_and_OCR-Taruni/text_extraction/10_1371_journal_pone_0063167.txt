Abstract
CFTR is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein and a cAMP-activated Cl2 channel. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to
Cystic Fibrosis (CF)–an autosomal recessive disease with majority of the morbidity and mortality resulting from airway
infection, inflammation, and fibrosis. The most common disease-associated mutation in the CFTR gene–deletion of Phe508
(DF508) leads to a biosynthetic processing defect of CFTR. Correction of the defect and delivery of DF508-CFTR to the cell
surface has been highly anticipated as a disease modifying therapy. Compared to promising results in cultured cell this
approach was much less effective in CF patients in an early clinical trial. Although the cause of failure to rescue DF508-CFTR
in the clinical trial has not been determined, presence of factor(s) that interfere with the rescue in vivo could be considered.
The cytokine TGF-b1 is frequently elevated in CF patients. TGF-b1 has pleiotropic effects in different disease models and
genetic backgrounds and little is known about TGF-b1 effects on CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Moreover, there are
no published studies examining TGF-b1 effects on the functional rescue of DF508-CFTR. Here we found that TGF-b1 inhibits
CFTR biogenesis by reducing mRNA levels and protein abundance in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial
(HBE) cells from non-CF individuals. TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR biogenesis without compromising the epithelial phenotype or
integrity of HBE cells. TGF-b1 also inhibits biogenesis and impairs the functional rescue of DF508-CFTR in HBE cells from
patients homozygous for the DF508 mutation. Our data indicate that activation of TGF-b1 signaling may inhibit CFTR
function in non-CF individuals and may interfere with therapies directed at correcting the processing defect of DF508-CFTR
in CF patients.

Introduction
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein from the
family of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. CFTR forms a
cAMP-activated Cl2 channel that mediates transepithelial Cl2
secretion in various fluid-transporting epithelia [1–3]. In the
airway, CFTR plays a critical role in regulating mucociliary
clearance by maintaining airway surface liquid [4,5].
Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to Cystic Fibrosis (CF)–the
most common fatal genetic disorder in Caucasians. CF patho￾physiology centers on the defective function of CFTR in various
tissues, most prominently the exocrine pancreas and airway. The
most common disease-associated mutation in the CFTR gene–
deletion of Phe508 (DF508) leads to a temperature sensitive
processing defect of the DF508-CFTR protein. DF508-CFTR is
retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an immature,
partially glycosylated form [6]. Low temperature and chemical
chaperones rescue the biosynthetic processing defect and allow
exit of DF508-CFTR from the ER, maturation while passing
through the Golgi complex, and trafficking to the cell membrane.
Because rescued DF508-CFTR is partially functional as a Cl2
channel, correction of the processing defect to deliver DF508-
CFTR to the cell surface has been highly anticipated as a disease
modifying therapy [7,8]. Several small molecules targeting
defective biosynthetic processing of DF508-CFTR, called CFTR
correctors have been identified [9]. The only corrector that
reached a clinical trial, VX-809 failed to mature DF508-CFTR,
did not rescue the functional defect of DF508-CFTR in nasal
epithelium and did not improve lung function in patients

homozygous for DF508 mutation despite partially correcting
DF508-CFTR in cultured cells [7,10]. Failure of VX-809 to rescue
the DF508-CFTR defect in CF patients raises suspicion for
presence of factor(s) that interfere with the DF508-CFTR rescue
in vivo.
CF patients are born with a structurally normal airway but over
the years acquire chronic infections and develop inflammation,
remodeling and fibrosis [11–13]. It is unknown how the pro￾inflammatory and pro-fibrotic CF environment may affect
therapies directed at correcting the processing defect of DF508-
CFTR. Studies demonstrate that cytokines such as interferon
gamma and several interleukins including interleukin 1ß, 4, and 13
regulate CFTR in different cellular models [14–18]. TGF-b1 is the
major plasma isoform of TGF-b–an extracellular cytokine with
immunomodulatory and pro-fibrotic properties [19]. TGF-b1
plays a key role in the pathophysiology of a number of pulmonary
disorders, including CF [20–23]. TGF-b1 signaling occurs through
the cell membrane associated transmembrane serine/threonine
kinase receptor (TbR) I and II [24]. TGF-b1 induces assembly of
TbRI and TbRII into a complex at the cell surface followed by
phosphorylation of Smad transcription factors, nuclear transloca￾tion of activated Smads, and transcriptional responses [25].
Nothing is known about the effects of TGF-b1 signaling on
CFTR in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells.
In other cell models TGF-b1 was shown to interfere with CFTR
expression and function [26–28]. Because TGF-b1 signaling
demonstrates tissue-specific and cell culture-dependent effects
[29,30] it is practically impossible to extrapolate results from other
models, including cells heterologously expressing CFTR to predict
the effects of TGF-b1 on endogenous CFTR in primary
differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells. Moreover, there
are no published data examining effects of TGF-b1 on DF508-
CFTR.
Studies conducted in primary differentiated human bronchial
epithelial cells from non-CF individuals (HBE) and from CF
patients homozygous for the DF508 mutation (CF-HBE) show that
TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR biogenesis by reducing CFTR mRNA
levels and protein abundance. Moreover, TGF-b1 inhibits
biogenesis of DF508-CFTR and interferes with the corrector
mediated functional rescue of DF508-CFTR.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
Primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE
cells; homozygous WT-CFTR and CF-HBE; homozygous DF508-
CFTR) were received from Dr. Joseph Pilewski (Cystic Fibrosis
Research Center Epithelial Cell Core at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA) as previously
described [31–33]. Cells were cultured on human placental
collagen-coated Costar Transwell filters (0.33 cm2 at density of
, 26105
/cm2 or 1.12 cm2 at density , 76105
/cm2 as previously
described and used for experimentation following 6–8 weeks of
culture at an air-liquid interface [34,35].
Antibodies and Reagents–The following antibodies were used: anti￾human CFTR (596; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics,
Inc.; Chapel Hill, NC), anti-ezrin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-N￾cadherin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-Smad2 (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA), anti-phospho-Smad2, anti-TbRI, anti￾Na,K-ATPase (Millipore; Billerica, MA), anti-Lamin B1 (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), and horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary
antibodies (BioRad Laboratories; Hercules, CA). All antibodies
were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufac￾turer. Human TGF-b1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), the TbRI
inhibitor SB431542 (Stemgent, San Diego, CA), Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).
Real-time Quantitative Reverse-Transcription (qRT)-PCR
Total RNA was isolated on two separate occasions from
triplicate individual cultures of different HBE and CF-HBE cells
per condition using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with additional on￾column DNase treatment with the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen)
to remove contaminating genomic DNA for downstream applica￾tions. Real time reactions were run in triplicates with each reaction
emanating from a starting sample amount of 20 ng total RNA
before Reverse Transcription to cDNA. Superscript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) was used to generate
cDNA from total RNA. qRT-PCR was performed using
ABsoluteTM Blue QPCR SYBRH Green ROX Mix (Thermo
Scientific, Walthman, MA) and ABI PRISMH 7900HT Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primer sequences for
CFTR RNA were from the Harvard Medical School Primer Bank
(ID#09421312c2; CFTR-213 forward: 59-
TGCCCTTCGGCGATGTTTTT -39 and CFTR-339 reverse:
59- GTTATCCGGGTCATAGGAAGCTA -39) [36]. The primer
sequences for GAPDH RNA were self-selected (forward: 59-
TGACAACTTTGGTATCGTGGAAGG-39 and reverse: 59-
AGGGATGATGTTCTGGAGAGCC-39). All reactions were
performed in triplicates. Fluorescence emission was detected for
each PCR cycle, and the threshold cycle (Ct) values and the
average Ct of the triplicate reactions were determined for CFTR
and GAPDH. The Ct value was defined as the actual PCR cycle
when the fluorescence signal increased above the background
threshold, and the DCt was determined for each sample by
subtracting the Ct for GAPDH from the Ct for CFTR, and the
mean DCt of the triplicate samples was determined. The DDCt
was calculated by subtracting the DCt for the negative control
(CTRL) treated cells from the DCt for the TGF-ß1 treated cells at
different time points. Fold change values were determined
according to the following formula: 22DDCT.
Isolation of Nuclear Fractions
Isolation of nuclear fractions in HBE cells to detect the nuclear
translocation of activated Smad2 after TGF-ß1 treatment was
carried out with the Nuclear Protein Isolation-Translocation Kit
(FIVEphoton Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Biochemical Determination of Plasma Membrane
Proteins and Western Blotting
The biochemical determination of proteins in the apical or
basolateral plasma membrane was performed by domain selective
plasma membrane biotinylation as described previously [37].
Permeable growth supports containing cells grown in air-liquid
interface were transferred quickly from the cell culture incubator
to a 6-well plate filled with phosphate buffered saline containing
1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2 (PBS++) at 4uC to stop
membrane trafficking. PBS++ was suctioned and the cell
membrane impermeable EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin
(Pierce Chemicals, Co., Rockford, IL; 0.8 mg/ml of PBS++) was
added for 30 minutes at 4uC to the apical or basolateral side of
growth supports to biotinylate the apical or basolateral membrane
proteins, respectively. Following a thorough washing with PBS++
cells were lysed in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1%

Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, and Complete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Cell
lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4uC and
10% of the supernatants was mixed 1:2 with Laemli buffer
(BioRad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) containing 100 mM
DTT at 37uC to prepare whole cell lysates (WCL). Biotinylated
proteins were isolated from the remaining supernatants with
streptavidin agarose and eluted into Laemli buffer containing
100 mM DTT at 85uC. CFTR, TbRI, and Na,K-ATPase were
visualized by Western blotting with appropriate primary and
secondary horseradish peroxidase antibodies using the Western
LightningTM Plus-ECL detection system (Perkin Elmer Inc.;
Waltham, MA) followed by chemiluminesence. Protein abundance
was quantified by densitometry using exposures within the linear
dynamic range of the film [37].
Short-Circuit Recordings
The short circuit currents (ISC) were measured in Ussing-type
chambers (Physiological Instruments; San Diego, CA) as previ￾ously described [34]. In brief, primary HBE cells cultured on filter
supports were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (P2300,
Physiological Instruments) with custom sliders modified to fit the
Transwell inserts, and the cultures were continuously short
circuited with an automatic voltage clamp (Department of
Bioengineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Transepithe￾lial resistance was measured by periodically applying a 2.5-mV
bipolar voltage pulse and was calculated using Ohm’s law. The

control. The p-Smad2 abundance at different time points after TGF-b1 treatment was compared to the amount before treatment (time ‘‘00).

TGF-b1 treatment to confirm Smad2 phosphorylation in WCL or after 24 h treatment to examine the nuclear content of p-Smad2. Enrichment of
lamin B1 and depletion of ezrin in the nuclear fraction confirms successful isolation of nuclear fraction. A 10-fold increase in p-Smad2 in WCL (similar
to C) demonstrated activation of Smad2. A 30-fold increase in p-Smad2 in the nuclear fraction after 24 h of TGF-b1 treatment coinciding with the
decline of p-Smad2 in WCL (B&C) indicates that p-Smad2 is translocated to the nucleus. (B–E) Experiments were repeated at least three times in HBE

25 mM NaHCO3, 3.3 mM KH2PO4, 0.8 mM K2HPO4,
1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM glucose. Chambers
were constantly gassed with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at
37uC, which maintained the pH at 7.4. Following an equilibration
period, the baseline ISC was recorded. Amiloride (10 mM) was
added to the apical bath solution to inhibit Na+ absorption
through ENaC. Subsequently, Isc was stimulated with the cAMP
agonist, forskolin (10 mM) added to the apical and basolateral bath
solutions followed by thiazolidonone CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh￾172 (20 mM) added to the apical bath solution to inhibit CFTR￾mediated Isc. Data are expressed as the CFTRinh-172 sensitive Isc
calculated by subtracting the Isc after CFTRinh-172 treatment
from the peak forskolin-stimulated Isc.
Rescue of Cell Surface Delivery of DF508-CFTR
To increase delivery of DF508-CFTR to the apical membrane
we used CFTR corrector VX-809 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX)
[7]. Additional experiments were performed with corrector CF￾106951 (also known as VRT-534; Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics,
Inc., Bethesda, MD) [38]. VX-809 (10 mM), CF-106951 (10 mM)
or vehicle control (DMSO) was added daily for 48 h to the
basolateral medium of CF-HBE cells. The final concentration of
DMSO was ,0.1%.
Data Analysis and Statistics
Statistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad
Prism version 5.0 for Mac OS6(GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA). The means were compared by a two-tailed t-test. A P
value ,0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as

Results
TbRI/II Polarizes to the Basolateral Membrane Domain in
HBE Cells
The TbRI/TbRII complex is located at the plasma membrane
[25]; however, little is known about membrane distribution of
TbRI/TbRII in polarized or differentiated epithelial cells.
Polarized distribution of TbRI/II has only been shown in canine
kidney (MDCK) cells, where the TbRI/II complex was found in
the basolateral membrane [39]. Because the TGF-b1 signaling
varies greatly in different cell types and under different cell culture
conditions [29,30] we first examined localization of the TbRI/II
complex in HBE cells. HBE cells–pass one were cultured for 6–8
weeks in air-liquid interphase to establish polarized monolayers.
Localization of the TbRI/II complex was examined by selective
cell surface biotinylation. The TbRI localized at the basolateral
membrane (Fig. 1A). Similar distribution was observed for TbRII
(data not shown).
TGF-b1 Signaling is Activated by Clinically Relevant
Concentrations of TGF-b1 in HBE Cells
There are no published studies examining activation of TGF-b
pathway in HBE cells. Acting via the canonical pathway, TGF-b1
activates (i.e. phosphorylates) Smad2 transcription factor and
induces nuclear translocation of activated Smad2 [25]. Clinically
relevant concentration of TGF-b1–15 ng/ml [40] added to the
basolateral medium of HBE monolayers induced phosphorylation
of Smad2 in whole cell lysates (WCL) in a time dependent manner
(Fig. 1B&C). The abundance of phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2)
decreased in WCL after the 6 h time point because p-Smad2 was
translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 1D&E). The nuclear translocation
of p-Smad2 was elicited by a range of TGF-b1 concentrations
(Fig. 1D). The effect of TGF-b1 was specifically mediated by
activating TbRI because the competitive inhibitor of TbRI,
SB431542 blocked the TGF-b1 mediated effect and prevented
Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). These data demonstrate that at
clinically relevant concentrations TGF-b1 activates the canonical
TGF-b pathway in HBE cells.
TGF-b1 Inhibits CFTR Biogenesis in HBE Cells
Transcriptional responses elicited by TGF-b1 signaling affect
gene expression and result in altered protein abundance [25]. We
first examined the effects of TGF-b1 on CFTR protein. TGF-b1
was added to the basolateral medium at increasing concentrations
for 24 h because by that time activated Smad2 had translocated to
the nucleus to elicit transcriptional responses. TGF-b1 at
concentrations similar to those that activated the canonical
TGF-b pathway reduced the WCL abundance of CFTR (Fig. 2A
versus Fig. 1D) and the most profound effect was observed at 24 h
(Fig. 2B). We examined TGF-b1 effects on CFTR in HBE cells
from different donors. TGF-b1 inhibited CFTR abundance by at
least 50% in cells from all donors but the range of inhibition
differed widely between cells from different donors (Fig. 2C).
Depletion of the WCL CFTR was accompanied by its depletion
from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D&E). These effects were
specifically mediated by TbRI because SB431542 blocked the
TGF-b1 mediated CFTR depletion (Fig. 2F&G).
Next, we examined TGF-b1 effects on CFTR mRNA levels.
HBE cells were treated with TGF-b1 (15 ng/ml) added to the
basolateral medium for 6, 12 or 24 h and the CFTR mRNA was
measured by qRT-PCR. Despite differences in the fold change,
TGF-b1 consistently decreased the CFTR mRNA in HBE cells
from all donors (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that TGF-b1
inhibits CFTR biogenesis by inhibiting CFTR mRNA levels in
HBE cells.
TGF-b1 Attenuates CFTR Mediated Cl2 Secretion in HBE
Cells
Control of the CFTR mediated Cl2 secretion across epithelial
cell monolayers is achieved at the level of both CFTR Cl2 channel
activity and the plasma membrane protein abundance [41,42].
Because inhibiting CFTR biogenesis by TGF-b1 decreased CFTR
abundance at plasma membrane (Fig. 2D&E), we predicted that it
would also inhibit CFTR mediated Cl2 secretion. HBE cells were
treated with TGF-b1 (15 ng/ml) added to the basolateral medium
for 24 h. TGF-b1 decreased the CFTRinh-172 sensitive short
circuit current (Isc) across HBE monolayers though the magnitude
of inhibition differed between HBE cells from different donors
(Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that in HBE cells decreased
biogenesis and depletion of CFTR from the plasma membrane by
TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR mediated Isc. TGF-b1 did not signifi￾cantly reduce the transepithelial resistance (TER) in HBE cells
indicating that TGF-b1 did not compromise the integrity of HBE
monolayers (Fig. 4C). These results are consistent with our
biochemical data demonstrating integrity of HBE cells during
TGF-b1 treatment because ezrin, an intracellular protein was not

detected in the biotinylated (i.e. plasma membrane) samples
(Fig. 2D).
TGF-b1 induces a phenotype switch from polarized epithelial to
motile mesenchymal called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transforma￾tion (EMT) [43]. The time required for the phenotype switch
differs between cell types and may depend on the initial state of
epithelial cell polarization and differentiation. To determine the
temporal relationship between the TGF-b1 mediated inhibition of
CFTR and EMT we examined the mRNA levels and protein
abundance of E- and N-cadherin, markers of the epithelial and
mesenchymal cell phenotype, respectively [44]. While TGF-b1
increased N-cadherin mRNA and protein levels it did not inhibit
the biogenesis of E-cadherin (Fig. 5). Because a switch from E- to
N-cadherin is the hallmark of EMT [45], these data indicate that
while the EMT signaling has been initiated by TGF-b1 the
phenotype switch has not occurred in 24 h. Together with
biochemical and functional data confirming integrity of HBE
monolayers, these results demonstrate that TGF-b1 inhibits
CFTR biogenesis in HBE cells while the cells maintain epithelial
phenotype.

TGF-b1 (15 ng/ml) or vehicle control (CTRL) was added to the basolateral medium and cells were incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, monolayers were

TGF-b1 Inhibits DF508-CFTR Biogenesis and Interferes
with the Functional Rescue the DF508-CFTR
To address directly the effects of TGF-b1 on DF508-CFTR we
studied cells from patients homozygous for the DF508 mutation
(CF-HBE). TGF-b1 (15 ng/ml) added to the basolateral medium
of CF-HBE monolayers for 24 h decreased the DF508-CFTR
mRNA levels (Fig. 6).
DF508-CFTR rescued by VX-809 is short-lived compared to
wild-type CFTR [38]. Thus, factors that inhibit DF508-CFTR
biogenesis would be expected to compromise the VX-809
mediated functional rescue of DF508-CFTR. Studies were
conducted to examine TGF-b1 effects on the functional rescue
of DF508-CFTR by two CFTR correctors, VX-809 and CF￾106951. As demonstrated in Figure 7A&B, both correctors
partially rescued the DF508-CFTR mediated Isc in CF-HBE cells
at 24 h. The functional rescue of DF508-CFTR by either corrector
was insufficient to detect rescue of DF508-CFTR at the protein
level (data not shown). Subsequently, cells treated for 24 h with
corrector VX-809 or CF-106951 were incubated with either TGF￾b1 or vehicle control in the presence of fresh corrector for another
24 h. TGF-b1 inhibited the DF508-CFTR mediated Isc rescued
by either VX-809 or CF-106951 (Fig. 7C–F). These data show
that in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells
TGF-b1 interferes with the functional rescue of DF508-CFTR.
The TGF-b1 effects were independent of the mechanisms or sites
of action of CFTR correctors because TGF-b1 inhibited the
functional rescue of DF508-CFTR achieved by both correctors.
Taken together the above results suggest that activation of TGF￾b1 signaling may compromise rescue of defective biosynthetic
processing of DF508-CFTR by the CFTR correctors.
Discussion
The major novel observation in the present study is that TGF￾b1 inhibits CFTR biogenesis by decreasing CFTR mRNA levels
and protein abundance in primary differentiated human bronchial
epithelial cells from non-CF individuals and from patients
homozygous for the DF508 mutation. Moreover, TGF-b1 inhibits
CFTR mediated Isc and compromises the efficacy of CFTR
correctors by inhibiting the functional rescue of DF508-CFTR.
Several lines of evidence in the present study support these
conclusions. Compared to controls, treatment of HBE cells with
clinically relevant TGF-b1 concentrations [23,40,46] activated the
canonical TGF-b pathway, inhibited CFTR mRNA levels, and
decreased CFTR protein abundance in a time and concentration
dependent manner (Figs. 1–3). Depletion of CFTR from WCL
correlated with decreased CFTR abundance in the plasma
membrane and with the reduction of CFTR mediated Isc
(Figs. 2D&4). TGF-b1 inhibited CFTR biogenesis without
compromising the epithelial phenotype or integrity of HBE cells
(Figs. 2D, 4C&5). Moreover, TGF-b1 decreased the DF508-
CFTR mRNA levels and inhibited the corrector mediated
functional rescue of DF508-CFTR in CF-HBE cells (Fig. 6&7).

whether the 24 h treatment with TGF-b1 alters the epithelial phenotype of HBE cells we examined the mRNA levels (A) and protein abundance (B) of
E- and N-cadherin, markers of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype, respectively. TGF-b1 (15 ng/ml) or vehicle control (CTRL) was added to the

TGF-b1 Inhibits CFTR in Human Airway Cells

Published studies have demonstrated that TGF-b1 affects
CFTR expression and function in some epithelial cell models,
although none of these studies has established the effects of TGF￾b1 on CFTR in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial
cells from non-CF individuals or CF patients. First, TGF-b1
inhibits CFTR and regulates water balance in human colonic
epithelial cells [26]. Second, TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR in epithelial
cells from non-CF patients with nasal polyps [27]. The clinical
significance of this finding remains unclear because non-CF
patients with nasal polyps demonstrate decreased TGF-b1 levels
compared to controls [22]. Third, TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR
expression and function in rat alveolar epithelial cells [28].
By contrast, our study demonstrates that in primary differen￾tiated human bronchial epithelial cells TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR
expression and function by an EMT independent mechanism.
TGF-b1 is an important mediator of EMT and plays an integral
role in repair and scar formation following epithelial injury and
contributes to development of fibrosis [47]. Our data indicate that
factors known to activate TGF-b1 signaling, such as infections,
environmental toxins, tobacco smoke exposure [40,48,49] could
inhibit CFTR biogenesis in vivo even prior to an established airway
epithelial cell injury. We do not know why exogenous TGF-b1
elicited such a wide range of CFTR inhibition in HBE cells from
different donors (Figs. 2C, 3A & 4B). Unlike immortalized and
clonally selected cells, primary differentiated cells, including HBE
retain many features of the unique in vivo cellular environment.
Thus, differences in the magnitude of TGF-b1 mediated CFTR
inhibition in our study could result from the cell donor-specific
differences in the endogenous activity of TGF-b pathway, TGF-b
gene polymorphisms, other cytokines affecting CFTR, and
additional epigenetic factors [14–18].

concentration of DMSO was ,0.1%. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times in CF-HBE cells from 3 different donors. In subsequent experiments,
corrector VX-809 (C&D) or CF-106951 (E&F) was used for 24 h to rescue the CFTRinh-172 sensitive Isc. Subsequently, TGF-b1 (15 ng/ml) or vehicle
control (CTRL) was added with fresh VX-809 or CF-106951 to the basolateral medium for 24 h. Monolayers were bathed in Ringer’s solution in the
presence of amiloride (10 mM). TGF-b1 decreased the CFTRinh-172 sensitive Isc rescued by either VX-809 or CF-106951. 6 monolayers/group from two

TGF-b1 Inhibits CFTR in Human Airway Cells
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63167

There are no published data on how TGF-b1 inhibits CFTR
mRNA level or whether a putative TGF-b1 consensus site exists in
the CFTR promoter. We do not know whether TGF-b1 inhibits
CFTR expression by transcriptional or postransctiprional mech￾anisms in HBE cells. Studies designed to address these questions
are in progress. The complexity and versatility of the TGF-b
pathway indicate that several mechanisms, including direct and
indirect may play a role in modulating CFTR expression.
Our study demonstrates that TGF-b1 may inhibit the corrector
mediated functional rescue of DF508-CFTR. In the CF airway,
TGF-b1 signaling is activated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, poor
nutritional status, or by certain TGF-b gene polymorphisms
[40,46,50–52]. According to our results, increased TGF-b1
signaling could explain at least in part the disappointing effects
of the investigational drug VX-809 in a recent clinical trial [10].
Future studies are needed to examine whether TGF-b1 or other
biomarkers of the CF lung disease could assist in predicting
efficacy of therapies designed to correct the DF508-CFTR
processing defect. Such biomarkers may serve to rigorously
evaluate investigational drugs in vitro and may help to individualize
future disease-modifying approaches in CF patients.
