Abstract
Biliary Atresia (BA), a result from inflammatory destruction of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, is a severe
hepatobiliary disorder unique to infancy. Early diagnosis and Kasai operation greatly improve the outcome of BA patients,
which encourages the development of early screening methods. Using HPLC coupled tandem mass spectrometry, we
detected primary bile acids content in dried blood spots obtained from 8 BA infants, 17 neonatal jaundice and 292
comparison infants at 3–4 days of life. Taurocholate (TC) was significantly elevated in biliary atresia infants (0.9860.62 mmol/
L) compared to neonatal jaundice (0.4760.30 mmol/L) and comparison infants (0.4360.40 mmol/L), with p = 0.0231 and
p = 0.0016 respectively. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for TC to discriminate BA and
comparison infants was 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.72–0.92). A cutoff of 0.63 mmol/L produced a sensitivity of 79.1%
and specificity of 62.5%. The concentrations of total bile acids were also raised significantly in BA compared to comparison
infants (6.6263.89 mmol/L vs 3.8163.06 mmol/L, p = 0.0162), with the area under ROC curve of 0.75 (95% confidence
interval: 0.61–0.89). No significant difference was found between the bile acids of neonatal jaundice and that of comparison
infants. The early increase of bile acids indicates the presentation of BA in the immediate newborn period and the possibility
of TC as newborn screening marker.

Introduction
Biliary atresia (BA) is the most significant life-threatening
hepatobiliary disorder in children which results from destructive
inflammatory process of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile
ducts [1,2]. If untreated, progressive liver cirrhosis leads to death
by 2 years of age. Clinical features of BA include jaundice, pale
stools and dark urine, shown at or soon after birth with normal
birth weights. The etiology of BA is largely unknown. Diagnosis of
BA is still difficult and operative cholangiography to visualize the
biliary tract is still the golden standard for the diagnosis [2]. Kasai
portoenterostomy is the first choice of treatment and good results
depend on early diagnosis and operation [3,4,5]. Since the use of
the infant stool color card to screen BA in Taiwan, BA patients
have been diagnosed earlier and the outcomes have been
improved remarkably [6]. However this screening method is
greatly affected by parents’ subjectivity. Because of the importance
of early diagnosis and treatment, a great deal of efforts have been
made to develop early detection methods for BA. For instance,
conjugated bilirubin in plasma measured at 6–10 days is a reliable
marker for neonatal liver disease [7]. Furthermore, elevated
direct/conjugated bilirubin levels were found shortly after birth
(within 24–72 hours) in BA infants [8]. Unfortunately, conjugated
bilirubin cannot be detected in dried blood spots because of its
light sensitivity.
Bile acids, as other important makers related with liver injury
and cholestasis , are widely investigated to screen or discriminate
cholestasis diseases, including BA [9], intrahepatic cholestasis of
pregnancy [10] and bile acid synthesis defects [11]. With the
widespread application of tandem mass spectrometry, this
technology was used to detect bile acids in dried blood spots
[12,13,14]. To evaluate if bile acids can be used as early screening
marker for BA, we detected the six primary bile acids in dried
blood spots of BA at 3–4 days after birth.
Methods
BA, neonatal jaundice, and comparison group
BA and neonatal jaundice cases were identified from Xin Hua
Hospital, Shanghai, China. BA cases were diagnosed by cholan￾giography. All the neonatal jaundice infants shown jaundice within
4 days after birth. Dried blood spots originally collected for
screening of phenylketonuria were used for this study. All the dried
blood spots were stored at 220uC after phenylketonuria screening.
Anonymized screening cards of the same month were randomly
selected to provide a comparison group of each BA card. Ethical
approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Xin Hua
Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from parents of
all BA and neonatal jaundice infants and oral consent was
obtained from parents of all comparison infants. Serum total and

Table S1.
Calibrators and Sample analysis
Stock solutions of 500 mmol/L of primary bile acids (cholic acid
: CA, glycocholate : GC, taurocholate : TC, chenodeoxycholate :
CDC, glycochenodeoxycholate : GCDC, taurochenodeoxycholate
: TCDC) were used to prepare calibrators. Whole blood with a
hematocrit of 55% active carbon desalted serum was spiked with
proper amount of stock solution to achieve final concentrations of
20, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 mmol/L bile acids. Twenty-five
micro liter of spiked whole blood was used for the preparation of
blood spot standards on filter paper. Calibrators were stored at
220uC.
Concentrations of the six primary bile acids were detected in
dried blood spots with an API 4000 MS coupled with a HPLC
system according to the method described by Janzen et al with
small modifications[13]. Three millimeter discs were punched and
incubated in 150 ml methanol with 0.5 mmol/L cholic-2,2,4,4-d 4
acid (d 4 –CA, internal standard) for 30 min. Ten micro liter of
supernatant was injected and separation was achieved using a
Luna C18 column of 5062.0 mm, 3 mmol/L, which was protected
by a C18 462.0 mm Precolumn from Phenomex (Aschaffenburg,
Germany). Data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.5
software from Applied Biosystems. Analytical settings and limit of
quantification for the six primary bile acids were listed in Table
S2. Total bile acid concentration was calculated from sum of the
six bile acids [15].
Statistical analysis
The data of bile acids were tested for normal distribution using
the Shapiro-Wilk test before calculation of differences. Normally
distributed data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by
a Post Hoc Dunnett Test. Non-normally distributed data was
analyzed using the Wilcox test or the Kruskal test. A p-value of
,0.05 was considered statistically significant. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to compare the screening
ability of these bile acids. All the analysis was carried out on the
freely available software R with corresponding packages. ROC
curves and box-plots of these bile acids were drawn by SPSS
version 19.0.
Results
Dried blood spots from 292 comparison infants, 17 neonatal
jaundice and 8 biliary atresia infants were enrolled in this study.
Six primary bile acids (CA, GC, TC, CDC, GCDC, and TCDC)
were measured in the dried blood spots with API 4000 tandem
MS. Figure S1 presents a representative LC-MS/MS chromato￾gram of bile acids in dried blood spots from BA. The
concentrations of conjugated primary bile acids were much higher
than the un-conjugated ones. The CA and CDC concentrations in
most cases were under the quantification limits. Hence, data of
these two bile acids was not analyzed in the following study. The
data of conjugated primary bile acids in comparison group was
tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk Test initially.
Because none of the data was normally distributed (data not
shown), the Wilcox test was used to analyze the differences among
BA, neonatal jaundice and comparison infants.
Concentrations of the four conjugated bile acids and total bile
acids were significantly higher in BA than comparison infants
(table 1). However, great overlaps existed between the two groups

(Figure 1 and 2). TC was most significantly elevated in BA infants
(0.9860.62 mmol/L) compared to neonatal jaundice
(0.4760.30 mmol/L) and comparison infants (0.4360.40 mmol/
L), with p = 0.0231 and p = 0.0016 respectively. The means of GC
and GCDC were higher in BA than in neonatal jaundice infants
with marginal significance (GC: 2.7162.26 mmol/L vs
1.3161.11 mmol/L, p = 0.0664; GCDC: 0.9460.55 mmol/L vs
0.6360.54 mmol/L, p = 0.0967). No significant difference was
found between neonatal jaundice and the comparison infants
except a minor increase of TCDC (1.8261.47 mmol/L vs
1.3461.29 mmol/L, p = 0.0591).
Figure 3 shows receiver operating characteristic curves for TC
and total bile acids to discriminate BA and comparison infants.
The area under the ROC curve for TC was 0.82 ( 95% confidence
interval: 0.72–0.92) which was significantly larger than total bile
acids (with the area under ROC curve of 0.75, 95% confidence
interval: 0.61–0.89) with p = 0.01976. Besides, the sensitivity and
specificity values for various TC cutoff levels were calculated
(Table 2). A cutoff of 0.63 mmol/L produced a sensitivity of
79.1%, specificity of 62.5%.
To analyze the difference among different storage time,
different gestational weeks and different genders, the Kruskal test
was also carried out. The conjugated primary bile acids show no
difference between different storage time, gestation weeks and
genders (data not shown).
Discussion
Biliary atresia is the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis
and 40–50% of liver transplantation in children is caused by this
disease [16]. Early intervention of Kasai portoenterostomy is very
important for BA patients. When the surgery is performed before
the age of 60 days, the success rate of establishing biliary drainage
is higher than those performed later [17] and the need for liver
transplantations in infancy and childhood is greatly reduced [5].
In this study, we evaluated the six primary bile acids in dried
blood spots of BA, neonatal jaundice and comparison infants
obtained 3–4 days after birth. All the conjugated primary bile
acids have already increased in BA newborns at 3–4 days of life
which echoes the report that all these bile acids were elevated
significantly in BA infants 7–10 days after birth [15]. The results
indicated that BA was present in the immediate newborn period or
late pregnancy. This is also supported by a case report by Toubi et
al., where a BA infants with disappeared gallbladder at age of 11
days was used to have normal gallbladder at the gestational age of
24 weeks [18]. In our study, the increase of TC and GC was
higher than TCDC and GCDC in early life of BA, while Mills et
al. found that the later 2 bile acids increased more significant in
cholestatic children at age of 3 weeks to 8 month [19]. These
findings may indicate that the liver damage has already begun but
is still mild in BA infants within 3–4 days of age as greater rise of
TCDC and GCDC meant severe liver damage [20]. Furthermore,
TC was found positively correlated with MCP-1, an HSC￾responsive chemokine, in cholestatic rats and in cystic fibrosis liver
disease [21]. The early elevation of TC may indicate the early
occurrence of fibrosis in BA patients.
According to previous research, two of the most promising
screening methods for BA yet are early measurement of serum
conjugated bilirubin and usage of stool color cards. In the test of
serum conjugated bilirubin at 6–10 days after birth, the sensitivity
and specificity reach 100% and 99.6% respectively [7]. However,
due to the light sensitivity of bilirubin, it is unsuitable to detect in
dried blood spots, which are easy to obtain and deliver for
newborn screening. Another method, the stool color card is widely
used in Taiwan to screen BA patients. The sensitivity of this
method was 97.1% in 2005 [22]. However the onset of pale stool
in a large amount of cases usually occurs later than 30 days of age,
which may delay the diagnosis and affect the outcome of
treatment. Measurement of TC in dried blood spots by LC-MS/
MS may be suitable for newborn screening due to the stability in
dried blood spots and relatively simple detection technique,
although the sensitivity and specificity are not as good as serum
conjugated bilirubin and the stool color card. Furthermore,
considering the effect of diurnal variations on the level of bile
acids in blood [23], the detecting accuracy may increase if all
blood spots were taken forenoon. After all, the elevated
concentrations of TC and other bile acids in dried blood spots
from BA infants have already indicted the potential screening
strategy for the future study.
Interestingly, no significant difference of bile acids was observed
between neonatal jaundice and comparison infants. This result
was understandable. It is well known that genetic and environ￾mental factors influence neonatal jaundice, such as ABO
incompatibility, breastfeeding and the method of delivery [24].
The infants with neonatal jaundice enrolled in this study have
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia which are unrelated with
hepatobiliary disease.
The main shortage of this study is the small sample size of BA.
Because of the scarcity of the disease, insufficient therapeutic
effects and low levels of cooperation among pediatric hospitals in
China, it is hard to obtain screening dried blood spots from BA
patients. Furthermore, the detection methods need to be
improved, which include but are not limited to the introduction
of UPLC, more sensitive MS and proper sample pretreatment
methods.
In conclusion, bile acids were elevated in BA infants at 3–4 days
of age indicates the immediate occurrence of the disease at birth.
The measurement of bile acids, especially TC, in dried blood spots
from newborns could be the potential screening strategy for early
detection of BA.
