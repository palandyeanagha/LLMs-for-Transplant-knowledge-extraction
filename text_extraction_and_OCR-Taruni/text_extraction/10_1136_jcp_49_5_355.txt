Extracellular matrix and the kidney
P N Furness
Introduction
Histopathologists have long recognised that ex￾cessive accumulation of extracellular matrix
in the kidney is a serious sign of irreversible
damage. However, we have rarely attempted
further analysis of such accumulations, beyond
noting the presence of pink staining material
in our haematoxylin and eosin sections, and a
rough estimation of its severity. This is remiss
of us, as fibrosis of the renal interstitium has
repeatedly been reported to be the best single
morphological correlate of renal function and
prognosis. 2
The purpose of this review is to summarise
selected recent developments in this field, and
to consider how these developments may alter
the ways in which histopathologists might as￾sess the extracellular matrix. Although I will
concentrate on the kidney, there are obvious
parallels with the assessment of non-neoplastic
disease in other organs.

The matrix proteins
Our ability to distinguish different extracellular
matrix proteins is increasing rapidly. "Col￾lagen" or "hyaline" is no longer sufficient.
Many different collagen types have been de￾scribed. Many of these can be made up of a
variety of different cz chains. The number of
non-collagenous matrix glycoproteins con￾tinues to grow. Furthermore, a single matrix
protein gene is often subject to complex splicing
of its mRNA,3 which may vary in different
organs and in different disease states. After
translation, the level of glycosylation may also
vary. The potential heterogeneity of the ex￾tracellular matrix is therefore enormous.
Type I collagen is most often assumed to be
the cause of pathological fibrosis, but in the
kidney it is usually only deposited late in the
process and in relatively small amounts. Much
more abundant is type III collagen, which pro￾duces smaller fibres and, somewhat unusually,
seems to be composed of only one a chain.
Type IV collagen, a non-fibrillar collagen, is
the main constituent of basement membranes.
Although type IV collagen is believed to auto￾assemble into sheets, immunohistochemical
studies show unequivocally that it can also
accumulate as pathological masses which, on
light microscopy, are indistinguishable from
other extracellular matrix proteins. Six different
collagen IV ot chains have been identified,4 and
the human sequences for all are now known.5
Any one triple helix only contains two or three
of these chains. Most basement membranes
contain cl (IV) and a2(IV), but glomerular
basement membranes contain the other chains
too. Investigation of this area has provided an
elegant explanation of the tissue specificities of
Goodpasture disease, Alport syndrome, and
Alport post-transplantation anti-glomular
basement membrane nephritis.4 The epitope
responsible for Goodpasture disease is located
on the at3(IV) chain,6 but the mutations which
cause Alport syndrome show it to be a hetero￾geneous disease, with various abnormalities on
several oa(IV) chains.78
Many situations in which "fibrosis" is de￾scribed in the kidney actually represent ab￾normal accumulations of non-collagenous
glycoproteins. The number of glycoproteins
associated with abnormal extracellular matrix
deposition continues to grow.9 A few justify
special mention.
The most abundant glycoprotein of base￾ment membranes, laminin, is now known to
exist in a variety of molecular forms,'0 ori￾ginating from several genes, the products of
which may be further modified by post-trans￾lational splicing. This phenomenon is common
in extracellular matrix proteins, and has also
been extensively studied in fibronectin. The
production of different splice variants is seen
in different organs and can also be modified in
different ways in different disease processes.11
Diseases with heavy proteinuria are associated
with loss of at least part of the molecule of
heparan sulphate proteoglycan from the glo￾merular basement membrane,'2 partly ac￾counting for the loss of the charge selective
function of the glomerular filtration barrier.
This molecule is also detected in abnormal
accumulations of matrix in the mesangium. It
is capable ofbinding to various growth factors'3
and modifying their activity, a field beyond the
scope of this review.
There has been much recent interest in ten￾ascin, a glycoprotein which has been associated
with control of cell movement and matrix
remodelling'415 and also with involution.'6 It
has been suggested that its presence correlates
with "active" fibrosis rather than old scarring.'7
Studies in the kidney have been few, but in￾creases in tenascin mRNA have been -reported
to coincide with elevation of transforming
growth factor (TGF)p mRNA in one animal

model.
8 Several recently described glyco￾proteins exhibit a close association with the
presence of specific cytokines-for example,
synthesis of decorin and biglycan is said to
be closely linked to local concentrations of
TGFIP."9 However, it is not necessarily the case
that extracellular matrix is synthesised locally;
in two experimental models of glomerular
sclerosis, abundant accumulations of fibro￾nectin were convincingly shown to originate
from plasma rather than local synthesis."20
The mechanism of such pathological trapping
remains obscure.
Matrix degradation
In normal tissues slow synthesis of extracellular
matrix is balanced by slow removal. In chronic
disease, therefore,
a decrease in removal could
result in tissue fibrosis. Consideration of the
mechanisms of fibrosis must therefore include
an assessment of rates and mechanisms of de￾gradation. Unfortunately this is hard to achieve. A variety of enzymes can degrade the matrix,
of which the most important is the group of
zinc-requiring enzymes known as the matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) and numbered
1 to
9.2' Of these, MMP2 (also known as gelatinase
A, 72 kDa metalloproteinase) and MMP9 (gel￾atinase B, 92 kDa metalloproteinase) have been
most extensively studied in the glomerulus. In
the tubules various other enzymes have been
described which can degrade extracellular mat￾rix,22 but it is often unclear whether this is
their physiological role, or whether they are
responsible for degrading peptides which have
been filtered and reabsorbed. Little is known
of the relative importance of these various en￾zymes in humans. Recently, a membrane bound
matrix metalloproteinase has been described,
which not only degrades matrix but also ac￾tivates other MMPs.23 This is likely to be of
great relevance to penetration of tissues by
inflammatory cells, and to invasion by malig￾nant cells, but its relevance in renal fibrosis is
not yet clear. The secreted metalloproteinases
are released in pro-enzyme form, with
a ter￾minal peptide being cleaved by a variety of
proteinases to achieve activation.
There are several specific inhibitors, known
as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase
(TIMP). TIMP1 and
2 have been extensively
studied for several years; TIMP3 has been
described recently but its primary sequence is
already known.24 TIMPs can not only inhibit
active MMPs, but can bind to the pro-enzyme
and inhibit its activation. Some MMPs also
bind to the extracellular matrix, which may
result in sequestration of their tissue activity.25
All these checks and balances make studies
in this area very difficult to interpret. The rate
of synthesis of any component may bear little
relation to its abundance, and the abundance of
an enzyme or an inhibitor does not necessarily
reflect the amount of the active form. Measure￾ment of enzyme activity in tissue homogenates
is not entirely reliable, as activation or in￾activation could have occurred during tissue
processing. Localisation of gelatinase activity
is possible by observing digestion of gelatin
films coated over frozen sections, but the
method is not sensitive and permits little
quantitation.
The control of matrix synthesis
Matrix production is controlled by
a complex
cytokine network,26 but the most important
single molecule identified so far seems to be
TGF.27-29 This cytokine has many effects in
all organ systems, but its main role in renal
disease seems to be in extracellular matrix
remodelling. TGFP in acute renal disease is
probably produced mainly by infiltrating
macrophages,30 but it can also be synthesised
by other cell types including mesangial cells,
resulting in autocrine stimulation and increased
synthesis of various extracellular matrix com￾ponents by mesangial cells and interstitial
fibroblasts.3' TGF,B also inhibits the synthesis
of matrix metalloproteinases and increases the
synthesis of their inhibitors.32 Evidence of the
importance of TGFP is not limited to tissue
culture; increased synthesis correlates with glo￾merular and interstitial fibrosis in intact an￾imals,33 anti-TGF,B ameliorates disease in
experimental nephritis34 and elevated TGFI3
is found in the urine of patients with focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis.35 Many factors
control TGFI activity. It is secreted in an
inactive form, but is readily activated by pro￾teases (or an acid environment).27 Like the
MMPs, it may be inactivated by binding to the
extracellular matrix.36 One important mech￾anism in chronic renal damage may be an￾giotensin II; this induces TGFPi synthesis in
vitro37 and angiotensin converting enzyme in￾hibitors limit excessive renal fibrosis in a variety
of models3839 and also in humans.40
Mechanisms of control of matrix synthesis
in diabetic nephropathy have been the subject
ofintense study. Induction ofcytokine secretion
seems to be part of this process.4' Cultured
glomerular cells produce more collagen in high
glucose media, but there is disagreement
whether increased synthesis42 or decreased de￾gradation43 is the more important effect. Giving
glycated albumin to mice elevates mRNA levels
of TGFi and various matrix components.44
Decreased proteinase activity has been reported
in diabetic rat strains which develop neph￾rosclerosis, but not in one which does not;
the sclerosis and the decreased enzyme activity
are ameliorated by treatment with insulin. The
importance of altered degradation has also been
suggested in sclerosis as part of the ageing
process; various strains of rat show
a gradual
elevation of collagen mRNA in their kidneys
with age,45 but only in strains which do not
produce an accompanying increase in de￾gradative enzymes is this accompanied by glo￾merular sclerosis.46 The mechanisms are
obviously very complex and are only slowly
being unravelled.
Interstitial fibrosis is
a constant companion
of chronic renal disease of almost any cause,
and correlates well with renal function.'2 Des￾pite this, the precise mechanisms of interstitial
fibrosis have been subjected to much less study
than glomerular fibrosis, possibly because the

Extracellular matrix and the kidney
cells in the normal renal interstitium are less
well characterised and less amenable to ma￾nipulation in tissue culture. One of the inter￾stitial cell types resembles a myofibroblast,
contains oa-smooth muscle actin and increases
in number in fibrotic renal conditions in
humans.47 Some parallels with the situation in
the glomerulus are evident.
The links between sclerosis and circulating
lipids are very complex. Glomerular cells bear
various lipoprotein receptors, which can be
modified in disease states.48 Culture of me￾sangial cells with low density lipoprotein leads
to increased synthesis of collagen49 and of a
peptide which acts as a macrophage chemo￾attractant.50 Fatty acid deficiency reduces
macrophage influx and glomerular damage in
rat nephrotoxic nephritis, apparently by in￾hibiting the synthesis of a lipid chemo￾attractant.5' In the interstitium lipids are also
likely to influence matrix synthesis. It has re￾cently been suggested that in proteinuric states,
some of the fatty acids carried by filtered al￾bumin may be modified after absorption by the
tubular cells to produce the lipid chemo￾attractant mentioned above, with consequent
macrophage influx and induction of fibrosis
(G E Schreiner, personal communication).
This lipid chemoattractant is not made from
the fatty acids found in fish oils, which could
explain the repeatedly observed benefit of fish
oil diets in experimental renal disease. This
area is complex and developing, and has been
reviewed recently.5253
Implications for the diagnostic process
It seems likely that we could now do better for
our patients than merely guessing at the amount
and nature of matrix accumulation. But what
should we measure, and how? We should be
clear what we are trying to achieve.
Attempting to identify matrix changes which
are specific to a disease process has a long
history,5455 but has had little success. With
improved understanding of the complexity of
the matrix some distinctions may nevertheless
be available. For example, the pattern of de￾position of the six oa(IV) collagen chains varies
in different diseases56; the changes are not spe￾cific, but this sort of approach might help if we
need only to distinguish two morphologically
similar conditions. In collagen type III glo￾merulopathy, a recently described hereditary
glomerular disease, the type of collagen which
accumulates in the glomerulus is the defining
feature of the disease.57 In diabetes the in￾creased matrix glycosylation has traditionally
been detected with a periodic acid Schiff stain,
but more specific detection of glycated proteins
can be achieved by immunohistochemistry.
Chondroitin sulphate has been reported in the
glomular basement membrane of rats with dia￾betes only.58 A detailed investigation of age
related changes in the glomerular extracellular
matrix in the rat showed patterns which were
different to those seen in most glomerular dis￾eases.59 Distinctions have also been claimed
in humans by some authors60 but denied by
others.6' It has been suggested that glomerular
accumulations of the glycoprotein tenascin are
seen only in relatively recent lesions in
humans62 but other authors have not supported
this finding.63 It is evident that progress in this
area will take a great deal more work, and
success is not guaranteed. It is a major problem
that the literature abounds with suggestions
and animal models, but exhaustive studies in
human renal biopsy specimens are lacking.
If, however, we are attempting to measure
the severity of a given disease process, there
are more grounds for optimism. The greatest
potential in this area is probably in assessing
prognosis.
We have the experience of numerous con￾ventional morphometric studies. The cor￾relation ofinterstitial fibrosis and renal function
has been mentioned, but in routine practice,
conventional morphometric methods are too
time consuming to be practical. Nevertheless,
various alternatives are appearing. An in￾genious method for using an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay to measure the collagen
content of a tissue section has been described,64
but so far has not been widely taken up. In our
own laboratories we are investigating the use of
immunostaining for type III collagen, without a
counterstain. A digital image is then "grabbed"
and the interstitial volume fraction can be meas￾ured rapidly by a semi-automated image anal￾ysis system. This takes only an additional
minute of a pathologist's time per case.
We may be able to do better still. If the end
stage of renal disease is fibrosis, and given our
understanding of the mechanisms which cause
fibrosis, should we not be looking at and meas￾uring the earlier stages, to predict the rate of
progression? The above discussion provides
numerous candidates for such study. The pres￾ence of an interstitial infiltrate of inflammatory
cells implies active disease; but which cells?
Measurement of interstitial lymphocyte subsets
is said to be of some prognostic value in mem￾branous glomerulonephritis.65 Would quanti￾tation of macrophages, possibly with an
immunohistochemical measurement ofvolume
fraction as described above, provide prognostic
information? Would quantitation of cytokines
such as TGFPi be better? Further down the
sequence of events, a conventional morpho￾metric measurement of interstitial myo￾fibroblasts has been claimed to give prognostic
information in a rather unpredictable disease,
IgA nephropathy.66 Does an excess of one mat￾rix component give better prognostic in￾formation than another? Tenascin might be a
candidate here. There is obvious potential, but
much more work is needed to define what
exactly is useful and practical.
Finally, the most exciting prospect in this
field comes from molecular biology. We have
so far considered only what is present in tissue
sections; we have not considered how fast
things are being synthesised. If accumulation
of, say, type III collagen is known to be sig￾nificant in a disease process, then it is likely
(though not inevitable) that the rate ofsynthesis
of type III collagen will give us prognostic
information. The best measurement of syn￾thetic rates we can get from a single biopsy

specimen is the level of the specific mRNA for
that substance. Specific mRNA sequences in
tiny biopsy specimens can be detected by in
situ hybridisation or by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In situ
methods have been used-for example, to dem￾onstrate elevation of mRNA for collagens in
glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells.6'
However, this approach lacks the sensitivity
and the potential for quantitation of RT-PCR,
especially competitive RT-PCR. Although RT￾PCR lacks tissue localisation, microdissection
methods have been used to obtain RT-PCR
samples in various tissues; in the kidney, single
glomeruli67 or short segments of tubule68 can
be used in this way. There is already evidence
that measurement of collagen mRNA in
a single
glomerulus correlates with glomerular sclero￾sis.69 Competitive RT-PCR has been used to
demonstrate quite small increases in levels of
mRNA of TGFI and tenascin in isolated glom￾eruli in diabetic mice.'8 There is no reason why
this approach should not be used with glomeruli
plucked from the surface of routine human
renal biopsy specimens. We have preliminary
data suggesting that further dissection may be
possible by using
a gentle lysis buffer which
extracts mRNA from glomerular epithelial cells
while leaving the rest inside the glomerular
basement membrane.70 The potential of such
new approaches is self evident.
There is much work to do, but these advances
in understanding and methodology provide
great scope for using our renal biopsy speci￾mens better, not only to obtain more diagnostic
information but also to gain
a deeper under￾standing of the processes which cause disease.
