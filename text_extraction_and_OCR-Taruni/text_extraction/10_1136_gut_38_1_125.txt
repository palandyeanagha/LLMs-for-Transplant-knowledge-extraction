Abstract
Chemoembolisation has been extensively
used as primary treatment for unresect￾able hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
In this unit, 185 patients with a new
diagnosis of HCC not amenable to
surgery were seen between 1988 and 1991.
Intended therapy for these patients was
chemoembolisation with doxorubicin (60
mg/M2) and lipiodol, repeated at six week
intervals until it was technically no
longer possible or until complete tumour
response had been obtained. Chemo￾embolisation was possible in 67 of the 185
(370/o). Reasons for exclusion were portal
vein occlusion (n=36), decompensated
cirrhosis (n=44), distant metastases
(n=5), diffuse tumour or unsuitable
anatomy (tumour or vasculature)
(n= 11), patient refusal (n= 11), and other
(n= 11). Patients excluded from treat￾ment survived for a median of 10 weeks
(range 3 days-19 months). In patients
treated, 18 had small HCC (<4 cm) and
49 had large or multifocal HCC.
Chemoembolisation was carried out a
median of two sessions for small and
three sessions for large tumours. Ten of
18 patients with small HCC showed a 50Gb
or greater reduction in tumour size. Five
of 49 patients with large or multifocal
tumours showed a response to treatment.
Median overall survival for treated
patients was 36 weeks (range 3 days-4
years). One patient has subsequently
undergone liver transplantation with no
recurrence and minimal residual disease
at transplantation. Two other patients
are alive three years after chemo￾embolisation, one with no evidence of
recurrent disease. No patient was
thought suitable for surgery after their
response to chemoembolisation. Chemo￾therapy related complications were seen
in 22%. Complications were significantly
more common in patients with larger
tumours and poor liver reserve. Five
patients died as a result of chemotherapy
related complications. In conclusion,
only one third of UK patients with
unresectable HCC are treatable by
chemoembolisation. Results with small
tumours are encouraging, with a high
response rate and the possibility of
surgical intervention in previously
inoperable disease. Large tumours, how￾ever, show a poor response and a signifi￾cant incidence of side effects, suggesting
that this treatment offers little benefit in
advanced disease.

Surgery remains the only curative treatment
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the
UK, most patients present with large tumours
and underlying cirrhosis and are not treatable
by surgical resection or transplantation.'
Medical treatment for advanced HCC has
generally produced disappointing results but
the advent of targeted chemotherapy using
lipiodol in combination with hepatic arterial
embolisation has generated considerable
interest, with uncontrolled series reporting
excellent survival2 3 and low complication
rates.4 5 There are, however, patients who
are not thought suitable for this treatment
because of severe underlying hepatic dysfunc￾tion or portal vein involvement,6 frequent
findings in the predominantly unscreened
patients presenting de novo with HCC in the
UK. This study aimed to analyse the useful￾ness of chemoembolisation in an unselected
cohort of UK patients in whom surgery was
not possible.
Patients and methods
Between January 1988 and December 1991,
195 patients presented to this unit with HCC.
Six patients were treated by orthotopic liver
transplantation and four by hepatic resection.
The remaining 185 patients were not con￾sidered suitable for surgery because of either
large or multifocal tumours, replicating
hepatitis B virus infection, distant spread of
disease, or compounding medical problems.
All patients were considered as candidates for
chemoembolisation as first line medical treat￾ment. Of the 185 patients unsuitable for
surgery, five were non-cirrhotic, 23 had
Child's A cirrhosis, 72 Child's B cirrhosis, and
85 Child's C cirrhosis at the time of presenta￾tion. The aetiology of the underlying liver
disease was hepatitis B in 51, hepatitis C in 47,
alcohol in 48, primary biliary cirrhosis in six,
haemochromatosis in four, cryptogenic disease
in 11, and other causes in 18. Criteria for
exclusion from chemoembolisation treatment
were as follows:
* Hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin >50 mmol/l
and encephalopathy);
* Renal failure (creatinine >200 ,umol/l;

anatomy (diffuse intrahepatic tumour), unsuit￾able vascular anatomy, portal vein occlusion
(main trunk only, segmental portal occlusion
accepted), or pulmonary shunting.
Chemoembolisation was carried out accord￾ing to a standard protocol. Patients were given
intravenous hydration, antibiotics, and H2
antagonists routinely before the procedure.
The anatomy was delineated at hepatic angio￾graphy beforehand. Selective cannulation of
the hepatic artery was followed by injection of a freshly prepared suspension of lipiodol and
doxorubicin (60 mg/M2) in
a final volume of
100 ml. After injection of this suspension into
the tumour feeding vessel, this vessel was
embolized using particulate material.
The response to therapy was determined by
serial computed tomography (CT) scans of the
liver and is defined as
a 50°/O reduction in the
maximum tumour diameter. Complications
relating to the procedure were noted and
chemoembolisation was repeated at six week
intervals until the patients either died, became
unfit for further treatment, or until anatomic￾ally unsuitable for treatment.
Results
Altogether 118 of 185 (65%) patients were
excluded from treatment. The reasons for this
were portal vein occlusion (n= 36), decompen￾sated cirrhosis (n=44), distant metastases
(n=5), diffuse tumour or unsuitable anatomy
(tumour or vasculature) (n= 11), patient
refusal (n=11), cardiac disease (n=5), renal
failure (n=4), and haematological (n=2). Of
the 118 patients excluded from therapy, 69
had Child's
C cirrhosis and 35 Child's
B cir￾rhosis (Table I). Of these patients, 44 received
intravenous chemotherapy (doxorubicin or
5
fluorouracil) and 12 had hormonal therapy
with tamoxifen. Larger tumours were also less
likely to be considered treatable, with only
20% of patients with tumours >8 cm diameter
being offered treatment (Table II).

RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
Chemoembolisation was possible in 67 (36%)
of the 185 patients. Chemoembolisation was
carried out
a median of two sessions for small
tumours (<4 cm) and three sessions for large
or multifocal tumours.
A total of 202 sessions
were undertaken during the three years
studied. In patients with small tumours
(n= 18), eight of 18 showed
a partial response
and two had complete responses (overall
response rate 56%). Of the 49 patients with
large or multifocal tumours, only one had
a
complete response and four
a partial response
to treatment (overall 10% response rate).
Serum oa fetoprotein (AFP) values fell in four
of six patients with
a small HCC and in nine of
33 with
a large HCC who had raised serum
concentrations at the time of diagnosis.
If tumour bulk is calculated from the
diameter of the liver lesions, there was
a close
relationship between tumour bulk and the
response to treatment (Fig 1). One patient
with multifocal HCC but small tumour bulk
(two lesions measuring 1.5 and 2.2 cm) had
a
complete response to treatment and has sub￾sequently undergone liver transplantation with
no recurrence (27 months later) and had
minimal residual disease present in the
explanted liver. No other patient was thought
suitable for surgery after the response to
chemoembolisation. A significant response to chemoembolisa￾tion was usually produced at the first or second
session, if no significant tumour shrinkage was
seen after two sessions no benefit in terms of
further reduction in radiological tumour size
was gained thereafter (Table III).
SURVIVAL
Overall median survival for the 185 patients
who were not treated surgically was 14 weeks
(Fig 2). For patients excluded from chemo￾embolisation, median survival was 10 weeks
(range
3 days-19 months). Treated patients
had
a median survival of 36 weeks (range
3
days-4 years) (Fig 2). The cause of death in
the 67 treated patients (63 deaths with median
follow up of
3 years) was liver failure in 24,
gastrointestinal haemorrhage in 11, metastatic
disease and/or cachexia in 21, chemotherapy
related in 5, non-liver related in 2. Survival

response to treatment was considerably better
than in patients with similar liver impairment
(responders: non-cirrhotic n=2, Child's A
n=4, Child's B n=8, Child's C n=1; non￾responders: non-cirrhotic n=2, Child's A

similar tumour sizes (mean tumour bulk:

Four patients in the treatment group sur￾vived for three years or longer after initial treat￾ment. One patient with multifocal disease but
small tumour bulk and Child's A cirrhosis
(hepatitis B virus related) showed a complete
radiological response to a single chemoemboli￾sation and after review showing no regrowth of
his HCC six months after therapy underwent
orthotopic liver transplantation. Minimal
residual tumour was found in one tumour
nodule and no viable tumour in the other. He
remains well two years after transplantation
with no tumour recurrence. One patient with
Child's A cirrhosis and a 2 cm lesion in the
right lobe of the liver had a complete response

radiological evidence of HCC. Two patients
with a partial tumour response and Child's B
cirrhosis had static disease for two years and 18
months respectively. One of these patients is
still alive at almost four years from diagnosis,
although with slowly progressive disease, and
the other, who had radiologically stable
disease, died of a myocardial infarction.
TREATMENT COMPLICATIONS
Initial pain and fever occurred in 90% of
treated patients. Twenty two per cent of
treated patients suffered more serious compli￾cations of therapy. There were two deaths
directly related to the procedure - one patient
developed renal failure and one immediate
hepatic decompensation. Nine patients devel￾oped neutropenic sepsis after chemoembolisa￾tion and in three this proved fatal. One patient
developed a late bile duct stricture (at four
months), which did not seem to be due to
tumour invasion and was thought to relate to
the chemoembolisation, and one patient bled
from a duodenal ulcer. Most of the serious
complications occurred in patients with
Child's C cirrhosis and a large tumour bulk
(Table IV).
Discussion
In this study we have shown that chemoem￾bolisation can produce a substantial reduction
in the size of the tumour as assessed radiologi￾cally but that this beneficial effect is unlikely to
be seen in those patients who present with a
large tumour bulk or a background of severe
liver disease. In addition, a large number of
patients are excluded from this treatment.
Almost two thirds of the patients were
excluded in this series, mainly because of
advanced liver disease or portal vein invasion.
This large proportion is disappointing, and our
finding is supported by the only other series to
report exclusion in a chemoembolisation pro￾gramme,7 where 57% of HCC patients were
excluded from treatment. There are consider￾able differences in the patient population in
this series from Africa and the UK group
studied here, the main reason for exclusion in
the African study was advanced disease but no
patient was excluded for portal vein invasion.
It is possible that alternative forms of therapy,
such as tamoxifen8-10 or absolute ethanol
injection,1' may be possible in these patients
but the prognosis at present remains dismal
with median survival measured in a few weeks
only. Some authors have suggested that portal
vein invasion is not necessarily a contraindica￾tion to chemoembolisation'2 providing the

embolization is carried out with highly selec￾tive cannulation of the feeding vessel. This
technique is technically demanding, however,
and few centres would consider using it in
patients who have main portal trunk involve￾ment.
Our finding that response to chemoemboli￾sation depends on tumour size and underlying
liver dysfunction agrees with previous studies.
Mondazzi et al,13 in
a multivariate analysis,
showed that age, Child's grade, and tumour
size were the most important prognostic
factors. The finding of poor response rates in
large tumours has not always been the experi￾ence of other groups - Ngan et al 14 reported a
very high response rate for chemoembolisa￾tion, even in patients with very large (12 cm)
tumours. Ikeda et al 15 also report
a significant
response rate in patients with tumours of
8 cm
and above and complete necrosis in
a 12 cm
tumour. Both these studies, however, conclude
that response rates are better in smaller
tumours. Two controlled trials published add
further support to our data16 17 showing no
overall increase in survival in patients with pre￾dominantly large tumours and poor underlying
liver function. The French experience with
large tumours has also not been encouraging;
Bismuth et al'8 found the results in Okuda
stage III patients so poor that they abandoned
the treatment in this group of patients.
There seems little doubt that some patients
with small tumour bulk and good liver function
have very good palliation of their tumours
using chemoembolisation. Other groups have
reported results which compare favourably
with historical controls in terms of patient sur￾vival19 and there is the possibility that tumours
previously not thought suitable for surgery or
transplantation show
a substantial decrease in
bulk and become operable. In our series only
one patient was thought suitable for transplan￾tation after treatment. The experience in
published reports is limited but suggests that
chemoembolisation does produce substantial
tumour necrosis and may improve the out￾come in cases considered to be borderline for
resection.20 Our current practice is to offer
chemoembolisation in combination with hor￾monal manipulation using tamoxifen wherever
this is technically possible. Our results suggest
that this is likely to be clinically useful in
patients with small tumours and good under￾lying liver function but is unlikely to be of
benefit to patients with tumours above
4 cm in
diameter and carries
a much greater risk of
complications in this group. 1 Johnson PJ, Williams R. Hepatocellular carcinoma. Postgrad
