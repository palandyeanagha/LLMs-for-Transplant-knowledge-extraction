Abstract
Background: Mechanical overload leads to cardiac hypertrophy and mechanical unloading to cardiac atrophy. Both
conditions produce similar transcriptional changes including a re-expression of fetal genes, despite obvious differences in
phenotype. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are discussed as superordinate regulators of global gene networks acting mainly at the
translational level. Here, we hypothesized that defined sets of miRNAs may determine the direction of cardiomyocyte
plasticity responses.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We employed ascending aortic stenosis (AS) and heterotopic heart transplantation (HTX)
in syngenic Lewis rats to induce mechanical overloading and unloading, respectively. Heart weight was 2663% higher in AS
(n = 7) and 3362% lower in HTX (n = 7) as compared to sham-operated (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 7). Small RNAs were
enriched from the left ventricles and subjected to quantitative stem-loop specific RT-PCR targeting a panel of 351 miRNAs.
In total, 153 miRNAs could be unambiguously detected. Out of 72 miRNAs previously implicated in the cardiovascular
system, 40 miRNAs were regulated in AS and/or HTX. Overall, HTX displayed a slightly broader activation pattern for
moderately regulated miRNAs. Surprisingly, however, the regulation of individual miRNA expression was strikingly similar in
direction and amplitude in AS and HTX with no miRNA being regulated in opposite direction. In contrast, fetal hearts from
Lewis rats at embryonic day 18 exhibited an entirely different miRNA expression pattern.
Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrate that opposite changes in cardiac workload induce a common
miRNA expression pattern which is markedly different from the fetal miRNA expression pattern. The direction of postnatal
adaptive cardiac growth does, therefore, not appear to be determined at the level of single miRNAs or a specific set of
miRNAs. Moreover, miRNAs themselves are not reprogrammed to a fetal program in response to changes in hemodynamic
load.

Introduction
Physiological and pathological changes in cardiac workload can
cause prominent alterations in gene expression [1]. These adaptive
genetic responses have been well described for cardiac hypertro￾phy and are characterized by an elevation of abundance of fetal
genes, for example in b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC) [2].
Remarkably, opposite changes in cardiac workload (i.e. hemody￾namic overloading versus unloading), although associated with
distinct phenotypes (hypertrophy versus atrophy), produce strik￾ingly similar transcriptional changes [3]. This principle finding was
confirmed by several groups demonstrating uni-directional
changes in hypertrophy-associated mRNAs - including ANP, b￾MHC and a-skeletal actin - in hypertrophied and atrophied hearts
(for review see [4]). These observations suggested that respective
changes, although characteristic for the remodeling process, may
have a limited role in regulating the direction of cardiac plasticity.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been identified as
superordinate regulators of global gene networks acting mainly
at the translational level. These small, endogenous, non-coding
RNA molecules are capable of suppressing gene expression in a
sequence-specific manner. Depending on the grade of comple￾mentarity with the target mRNA, miRNAs either repress
translation or induce degradation of mRNA. Usually the

interaction of a miRNA with its target mRNA is characterized by
mismatches, which then leads to translation repression rather than
a decrease in mRNA amount [5]. Recent studies have document￾ed an essential role for various miRNAs in modulating key
components of the hypertrophic process in the heart [6–13].
Moreover, miRNA expression profiling in pathologically hyper￾trophied or failing hearts in humans and mice suggests that
miRNA expression changes may be typical for specific cardiac
diseases [11,14–19]. Similar studies on hemodynamically unload￾ed, atrophied hearts, however, do not exist yet. Heterotopic heart
transplantation has been established previously as a reliable
methodology to induce atrophic growth in vivo [2,3,20–22].
Given that miRNAs can regulate global gene networks at the
translational level, we hypothesized that the switch towards either
a hypertrophic or atrophic phenotype is associated with the
activity of specific sets of miRNAs. To test this hypothesis we
analyzed the expression of a broad range of miRNAs using
quantitative stem-loop RT-PCR arrays on left ventricular samples
from rat hearts, in which hypertrophy (mechanical overload) or
atrophy (mechanical unloading) of comparable extent were
induced. To evaluate the degree of overlap between the miRNA
expression pattern(s) activated during postnatal cardiac remodel￾ing with those active during fetal development we also investigated
the expression of miRNAs in rat hearts at embryonic day 18.
Results
Highly concordant miRNA expression in hypertrophic
and atrophic hearts
To assess the hemodynamic load-induced changes on miRNA
pattern, male Lewis rats were subjected to increased cardiac
workload by ascending aortic stenosis (AS) or to decreased cardiac
workload by heterotopic heart transplantation (HTX). Hearts
from sham-operated animals (Sham) served as controls for AS. Not
manipulated orthotope hearts of the HTX recipients (Native)
served as controls for HTX. As expected, AS (n = 7) and HTX
(n = 7) resulted in a higher (+2663%) and a lower (-3362%)
relative heart weight, respectively (Figure 1A). The relative heart
weights of the control groups (Native: 2.760.1 mg/g, n = 7; Sham:
2.860.1 mg/g, n = 6) did not differ.
To identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in
hypertrophic and atrophic hearts, we performed specific stem￾loop RT-PCR analysis targeting a panel of 351 different mature
miRNAs (Table S1) in left ventricular tissue. Out of all miRNAs
investigated, 153 miRNAs could be unambiguously detected; a
mean cycle of threshold (CT) value of 35 cycles was defined as a
cut-off for reliable miRNA detection (CT value defines the
threshold, i.e. the cycle number when exponential PCR product
amplification occurs; Table S1).
To focus the following expression analysis on miRNAs that have
recently been shown to be expressed in the human or rodent
cardiovascular system [11,12,14,15,23], a reference list was
compiled containing 81 miRNAs. The miRNA array used in this
study was based on human mature miRNA sequences (see Table
S1). To exclude that this species difference impairs the expression
analysis, a sequence comparison was performed using the current
version (release 16) of the Sanger miRBase (see Table S2).
According to this database, 72 miRNAs are 100% conserved
between these species. Thus, independent of the species, the
primers used by the human miRNA array fully detect these
miRNAs. Three miRNAs of this initial cardiovascular reference
list, however, are not 100% conserved between human and rat
(miR-1, miR-211 and miR-424) and six miRNAs have not yet
been registered for rats (miR-7g, miR-149, miR-15a, miR-199b,
miR-372 and miR-486). Nonetheless, stable expression could be
detected for these nine miRNAs in all experimental groups,
indicating that (1) the single nucleotide polymorphisms did not
abrogate the detection efficiency and (2) the yet unannotated
miRNAs have homologues in rat. To fully exclude the possibility
of incorrect expression analysis and subsequent interpretation,
however, these miRNAs were excluded. Table 1 lists the
remaining 72 miRNAs which met the above described inclusion
criteria and were, therefore, included in the following data
analysis.
The relative expression of each of these miRNAs was then
normalized to miR-145, which was found to display a robust and
stable expression within all experimental groups (CT ,26, see
Table S1). The internal control miR-145 and the hitherto best
characterized miRNA relevant for the cardiovascular system,
miR-21, were analyzed by Northern blotting (Figure 1B and 1C),
which confirmed the data of the quantitative reverse transcriptase￾polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and previous publications
[11,18,24].
MiRNA abundance in the two control groups (Native and
Sham) did not differ in any of the potentially relevant miRNAs
(two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni posthoc test). Figure S1
illustrates the DCT values (CTsample-CTmiR-145). This plot reveals
a strict linear relationship of the quantitative miRNA expression
between both groups with a slope of 1.0060.01 (r2= 0.99, n = 72).
Therefore, both groups were considered identical and were pooled
to form a single control group (Control). The miRNA expression
data of the two intervention groups (AS, HTX) were then
normalized to the Control expression data (log2RQ, Table S3).
Based on the number of tissue samples and the resolution of the
quantification method, we defined a difference in miRNA
abundance by 650% from Control, corresponding to 60.58 on
the log2RQ scale, as up- and down-regulation, respectively.
Accordingly, a total of 40 miRNAs were regulated in hypertro￾phied (AS) and atrophied (HTX) hearts, respectively (Table S4).
The vast majority of these miRNAs (n = 35) exhibited increased
expression levels (Figure 2A), comprising 13 miRNAs in
hypertrophied hearts (AS) and 34 miRNAs in atrophied hearts
(HTX). 12 of these miRNAs were $50% up-regulated in both
groups with particularly strong increases in expression for miR￾199a, miR-21, miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-31
(Figure 2B). Moreover, 22 miRNAs were $50% up-regulated
selectively in HTX hearts and one miRNA in AS hearts. By
contrast, the relative changes of the five down-regulated miRNAs
were modest, barely exceeding a log2RQ value of -1, and were
restricted to the AS group (Figure S2).
The Venn-analysis only refers to qualitative changes in the
expression. However, since quantitative effects may be biologically
more important, we plotted absolute changes in the expression
levels of all individual miRNAs measured in atrophied hearts
versus those measured in hypertrophied hearts. Surprisingly, this
analysis revealed a highly concordant regulation of individual
miRNAs in AS and HTX (r2= 0.79, slope = 0.960.07; n = 40,
Figure 3). Notably, no single miRNA was found to be regulated in
opposite directions in response to AS and HTX, respectively.
To identify potential targets of (1) the miRNAs that were
commonly activated by cardiac atrophy and hypertrophy and of
(2) the miRNAs activated only during cardiac atrophy, down￾stream targets were predicted using the TargetScan algorithm
which is based on human miRNA targets [25–27]. By calculating
the most likely mRNA targets, the prediction algorithm ranked
,3000 different genes potentially targeted by the 12 miRNAs up￾regulated in both remodeling processes (see Table S5) and ,5600
different genes targeted by the 22 miRNAs up-regulated only in

atrophic hearts (see Table S6). Analysis of related gene ontology
terms did not reveal a significant overrepresentation of specific
functional categories (data not shown).
Hypertrophic and atrophic remodeling differ markedly
from the fetal miRNA expression pattern
Several studies have reported that both cardiac unloading and
overloading induce changes in gene expression that mimic the fetal
gene program in important aspects, e.g. genes involved in cardiac
metabolism or in contractile properties [3,4]. To test the
hypothesis that the common miRNA signature induced by altered
cardiac workload represents a reprogramming towards a fetal gene
response we analyzed the miRNA expression in fetal hearts from
male Lewis embryos at embryonic day 18 (Fetal, ED18, n = 6). All
data were normalized to miR-145 and compared with expression
levels observed in the Control hearts (Table S3). Notably, the
majority of miRNAs (61 out of 72) differed between Fetal and
adult hearts (Table S7). Similarly, the concordance of miRNA

levels in Fetal hearts and in both intervention groups was
surprisingly low (Fetal versus AS - Figure 4A; Fetal versus HTX
– Figure 4B). Indeed, neither of the data sets could be described by
any linear or non-linear relationship, indicating that neither AS
nor HTX merely induces a gross re-expression of a fetal miRNA
program.

Discussion
The adult mammalian heart can considerably increase
(hypertrophy) or decrease (atrophy) its size in response to
alterations in mechanical workload. In this study we analyzed
miRNA abundance in left ventricular myocardium using quanti￾tative stem-loop RT-PCR based miRNA expression arrays in two
well established in vivo models of altered cardiac workload, i.e. AS
(model of cardiac hypertrophy [3,28–30]) and HTX (model of
cardiac atrophy [2,3,20–22]). We discovered that opposite changes
in cardiac workload associated with nearly maximum changes in
left ventricular mass (+26% versus -33%) induce highly concordant
miRNA expression profiles without any miRNAs being regulated
in opposite directions.
One may argue that the miRNA expression pattern associated
with cardiac hypertrophy does not necessarily need to be the exact
inverse of that associated with cardiac atrophy. However, not only
the qualitative (up- or down-regulation) but also the quantitative
changes in miRNA expression were highly concordant in the
hypertrophied and atrophied hearts. The relation of the relative
gene expression levels in hypertrophied and atrophied hearts could
be well described by a linear function with a slope of close to one
(see Figure 3). These findings suggest that any change in cardiac
workload - independent of its direction - induces a common
miRNA remodeling program. Similar common responses to
changes in hemodynamic load have also been described for the
so-called fetal genes (e.g. ANP, b-MHC, and a-skeletal-actin [3])
as well as for cellular remodeling processes (e.g. in cardiac
electrophysiology [21]).
Such a concept, however, would also imply that the direction of
growth plasticity in postnatal cardiomyocytes is not determined at
the level of miRNA transcription. It must be emphasized here that
miRNA expression profiling studies cannot define possible
functional distinctions between constant "pools" of miRNAs, de
novo synthesized miRNAs, and posttranscriptional miRNA pro￾cessing [12]. Thus, an apparent discordance between qRT-PCR
findings and plasticity changes could reflect differences in miRNA
localization, processing and/or stability, which may be more
critical in determining the overall direction of adaptive cardiomy￾ocyte plasticity in the adult heart [2].
The cellular remodelling induced by AS and HTX may be
associated with increased fibrosis and autophagy which could
explain some of the similarity in the gene responses to both
interventions. MiR-29, miR-133 and miR-30c are the most
strongly fibrosis-associated miRNAs targeting a number of
extracellular-matrix-related mRNAs [31,32]. These miRNAs,
however, were not regulated under our experimental conditions
arguing against a pathological activation of fibroblasts. Autophagy
has been shown to be activated in cardiac remodeling in virtually
every form of myocardial disease and appears to serve as a
protective mechanism [33–35]. However, functional regulation of
autophagy by specific miRNAs in cardiac myocytes has not been
determined yet.

Previous reports on miRNA expression in the cardiovascular
system focused on pathological cardiac hypertrophy and failing
hearts [14–16]. Biomechanical stress and neurohumoral factors
are considered to be the two most important triggers of cardiac
hypertrophy, with neurohumoral activation primarily involved in
pathological cardiac growth [36]. Ascending aortic stenosis [28,29]
and heterotopic heart transplantation induce large functional
changes in hemodynamic load without major neurohumoral
activation. Accordingly, the alterations in miRNA expression
patterns observed in the present study most likely represent the
physiological adaptive responses to altered cardiac workload.
However, differences may exist between this miRNA response
pattern and that induced in hearts undergoing a pathological
structural remodeling.
Our data on specific miRNA changes induced by AS in rats are
in very good accordance with other studies on mouse hearts
subjected to transverse aortic banding/constriction. Several
miRNAs, including miR-21, miR-27, miR-31, miR-199a, miR￾214 and miR-222 were up-regulated in these mouse models in the
same directions and to similar extents as observed in this study
[11,18]. This indicates that species and model differences do not
have a major impact on miRNA regulation.
Interestingly, we observed that the total number of miRNAs
being $50% up- or down-regulated as compared to control
differed between HTX and AS. Overall, HTX hearts displayed a
broader activation pattern of moderately regulated miRNAs
(Figure 2A and Figure S2). One possible reason for this difference
in global miRNA regulation may be that the degree of atrophic
versus hypertrophic remodeling does not directly match with the
absolute changes in left ventricular mass.
Cardiac overloading and unloading have both been shown to
reactivate the expression of fetal genes [3,4]. In the present study,
however, neither condition produced a miRNA expression pattern
which resembled the fetal miRNA expression pattern (see
Figure 4). This finding suggests that miRNAs themselves - in
contrast to mRNAs - are not reprogrammed to a fetal phenotype
in response to changes in biomechanical stress. This does not
support the general idea that fetal gene reprogramming induced
by workload dependent cardiac stress is a global event involving all
molecular and transcriptional regulatory levels of the heart. In
contrast to our study that focused on miRNA regulation as a
response to short term cardiac overload without secondary,
adverse effects from heart failure, chronic cardiac diseases may
indeed induce a fetal miRNA expression pattern. A recent study
by Thum et al. analyzing miRNA levels in failing and in fetal
human hearts reported that .80% out of ,350 miRNAs showed
concordant differences compared to healthy controls [15].
Some limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, the
expression of miRNAs was analyzed using primers based on the
human mature miRNA sequences. Only miRNAs that have a
homologue in rats and that are 100% conserved between humans
and rats were included in this study (Table S2). Thus, while these
criteria led to the exclusion of nine miRNAs (see Results), the
expression data of the 72 miRNAs remaining in this study
(Table 1), are not affected by the use of human based miRNA
arrays. However, it cannot be excluded that single miRNAs
relevant for the development of hypertrophy and/or atrophy
specifically in rats may have been overlooked. This limitation is
caused by the current, rather poor, annotation rate for miRNAs in
the miRBAse and, thus, affects all miRNA expression analysis
carried out in rats. Second, the duration of overloading (7 days)
and unloading (14 days) - although causing comparable degrees of
changes in left ventricular mass (6,30%) - may not correspond to
the time at which changes in miRNA expression have their major
impact. It has been shown, however, that several contractile and
metabolic transcripts remain up- or down-regulated at remarkably
constant levels between day 7 and day 28 in overloaded and
unloaded hearts [3] which suggests that the regulation of the
transcriptome has attained a steady state during this time span
after a sudden change in hemodynamic load. Third, the target
prediction analysis did not reveal any specific sets of genes

involved in defined cell-biological aspects. This is very likely due to
the complex nature of cardiac remodeling and due to the fact that
the existing computational algorithms are still challenging [37]. It
should, however, be pointed out that the predictions were carried
out for the evolutionary conserved miRNAs. Thus, although based
on the known human miRNA targets, the target prediction
algorithm should reveal all functionally important targets which
are fully conserved across species. Finally, this study does not
exclude that atrophic and hypertrophic remodeling may be
controlled by a fine-tuning within a large network involving
minimal changes (below 650%) in a large number of individual
miRNAs.
In conclusion, this study provides unexpected evidence that in
adult hearts changes in biomechanical stress per se induce a specific
miRNA remodeling pattern which, however, does not determine
the direction of the growth response in postnatal cardiomyocytes
and does not resemble the fetal miRNA program.
Materials and Methods
Animal models and tissue samples
All experiments were performed in syngenic male Lewis rats
(Charles River, Germany). Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in
adult rats (22466 g, n = 7) by ascending aortic stenosis (AS) for 7
days as previously described [30]. Hearts from sham-operated
animals (Sham; 24268 g, n = 6) were also excised after 7 days.
Cardiac atrophy was induced in adult rats (donor rats: 23663 g,
n = 7; recipient rats: 23664 g, n = 7) by heterotopic heart
transplantation (HTX) as previously described [2,3,20–22].
HTX hearts and native in situ hearts (Native, n = 7) from the
recipient animals were explanted after 14 days of unloading.
Ventricular tissue of male fetal hearts was harvested at embryonic
day 18 from pregnant Lewis rats (Fetal, n = 6). All animal
experiments were approved by local authorities (Ministry for
Social Affairs, Family, Health and Consumer Protection, Ham￾burg, Germany, approval number: 02/04).
Gene expression analysis
Expression levels of miRNAs were determined by quantitative
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [38].
Small RNAs from left ventricular tissue were enriched by using
mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Inc.). qRT-PCR was
performed with cDNA generated from 100 ng of total RNA by
using Multiplex RT for TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied
Biosystems) with highly-specific stem-loop reverse-transcriptase
(RT) primers for 351 different mature human miRNAs (see Table
S1 for the context sequences). Table S2 shows that all miRNAs
which have previously been shown to be expressed in cardiovas￾cular tissues (n = 72, see also Table 1) are fully conserved between
human and rat (release 16 of the Sanger miRBase). Thus, the
relevant miRNAs are fully detected by the human based primers
irrespective of the species. Real-time PCR reactions were executed
on each target using TaqMan Low Density Array (Applied
Biosystems). The 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System and SDS
software were used to amplify and detect specific products.
Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described [39].
Data analysis and normalization
CT values of miRNA expression obtained from qRT-PCR
analysis were processed using the SDS software 2.3 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA)
and PRISM 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Only miRNAs with
mean CT values #35 in all groups were included in this study
(n = 153, Table S1). All CT values were normalised to miR-145 by
the equation:
DCT~CTsample{CTmiR{145
The relative expression (RQ) of each miRNA in the target groups
(AS, HTX, Fetal) was calculated by the equation:
RQ~2{ð Þ DCTtarget{DCTcontrol
The Control group consisted of the pooled data from Sham and
Native hearts (see Results). For means of clarity, the relative
expression data are given as log2RQ within the manuscript (unless
stated otherwise, Table S3).
MiRNA target prediction
MiRNA targets were predicted using the current version
(release 5.1) of the TargetScan algorithm (http://www.targets￾can.org) as described previously [26,27] (see [25] for a review).
Briefly, the algorithm calculates a "context score" for each
predicted miRNA hit, which corresponds to the log2 ratio (hence
lower values mean stronger repression) of expected regulation in
experimental systems [26]. A cumulative (or "total") context score
for a given transcript can thus be calculated by summation of the
score values of individual sites. For the prediction of jointly
regulated transcripts, predictions were made first for individual
miRNA seed families, and a joint or "cumulative" context score
was then calculated by summation of the "total" context scores of
individual seed family hits.
Statistical analysis
Data are given as mean6SEM. Unless stated otherwise,
statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni posthoc test for multiple comparisons using
PRISM 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

Table S5 Potential mRNA targets of the 12 miRNAs up￾regulated in AS and HTX hearts (see also Table S4). MiRNA
target transcripts were predicted using the TargetScan algorithm
as described in Material & Methods. For each individual transcript
and miRNA seed family, the rightward columns of the table list
the number of evolutionary conserved and non-conserved hits
(further classified according to the type of seed match, i.e. 8mer,
7mer-m8 or 7mer-a1), the total context score of the prediction (a
measure of the predicted efficacy of targeting) as well as the
aggregate PCT (preferentially conserved targeting) value, which is
a metric that considers the phylogenetic relationship between
species in which the site is conserved. The leftmost columns titled
‘All miRNAs’ give the total number and names of miRNAs for
which target sites were predicted in a particular transcript, as well
as the sum counts of conserved and non-conserved hits (note that
the table only lists transcripts for which at least one evolutionary
conserved target site was predicted). The predicted targets are
sorted according to the "Cumulative Context Score" column,
which corresponds to the sum of the individual context score
values and thus is a simulated measure of combined targeting by
all upregulated miRNAs. The column "Min. Aggregate PCT"
indicates the minimal PCT value achieved by any of the miRNAs
predicted to target a given transcript.

columns of the table list the number of evolutionary conserved and
non-conserved hits (further classified according to the type of seed
