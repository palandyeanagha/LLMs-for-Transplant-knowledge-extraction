Abstract
Background: Various pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection
fraction (HFPEF). Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a
proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF).
Methods and Results: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) axis in
community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNFa, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNFa
cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNFa and TNFR1 were
significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both
controls and HFREF. TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age,
estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial
fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of
symptoms in HFPEF.
Conclusions: Inflammation mediated through TNFa and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, may represent an important
component of a comorbidity-induced inflammatory response that partially drives the pathophysiology of HFPEF.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) continues to have a significant clinical burden
with a high mortality and morbidity, and has a worse one-year
prognosis than cancer [1]. There are several classification schemes
in HF; however, a common clinical approach involves classifying
ambulatory patients with chronic HF into HF with preserved ($
50%) or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (,50%; HFPEF
or HFREF, respectively) [1,2]. HFPEF presently accounts for
approximately 40% of HF diagnoses, with a rising incidence, and
mortality and morbidity comparable to HFREF [3–5]. Despite
similarities in outcomes, it appears that HFPEF and HFREF
represent distinct groups, with many pathophysiological differenc￾es, along the continuum of the HF [6]. Indeed, differential
responses to therapeutic interventions between these two groups
strongly support this concept. Clinical trials have validated
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II￾receptor blockers (ARB), beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists
(beta-blockers) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)
as therapeutics in HFREF [1]. Conversely, trials of ACEi, ARB,
beta-blockers, MRA and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor failed to
show any consistent and significant improvement in the clinical
outcomes of patients with HFPEF.
Biomarker studies have differentially implicated various path￾ways in HF, including fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodel￾ing, oxidative and cardiomyocyte stress, and inflammation [7–12].
A recent report showed that circulating tumor necrosis factor￾alpha (TNFa) receptor 1 (TNFR1) levels are significant predictors
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99495

of incident HF, in particular for HFPEF versus HFREF [13].
Circulating TNFa and its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) are
elevated in patients with heart failure relative to controls [6,14].
The study presented herein expands on previous work by
exploring associations between diastolic dysfunction or heart
failure severity, and plasma levels of TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2,
as well as a non-TNFa family cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in
community-based cohorts of healthy controls, and ambulatory
HFPEF and HFREF patients. Using well-defined HF cohorts, we
set out to elucidate some elements of the mechanisms that drive
HFPEF and HFREF. Our novel findings suggest that elevated
plasma levels of TNFa receptors, in particular TNFR2, are more
closely linked to the pathophysiology of HFPEF than HFREF.
Methods
Ethics statement
This study conforms with the conventions outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki, it received internal ethics board approval
at the Universities of Alberta and Calgary for use of human
subjects, and all subjects gave written informed consent [15].
Patient recruitment and baseline analysis
As part of a prospective clinical study, the Alberta HEART
(Heart Failure Etiology and Analysis Research Team) project,
community-based, ambulatory patients with clinical diagnoses of
HF and healthy age- and gender-matched controls (n = 50) were
consecutively recruited for comprehensive clinical, echocardio￾graphic and biomarker analyses during a three-year period
beginning in 2010 through the end of 2012. Blood pressure was
recorded sitting or recumbent, and detailed clinical data were
compiled at the time of enrollment. Transthoracic echocardio￾grams were performed using the Phillips IE33 ultrasound
platform. Echocardiograms were interpreted by cardiologists with
specialized echocardiography training who were blinded to both
the clinical classification and biomarker analyses. LVEF was
assessed using Simpson’s biplane method of disks. HF patients
were adjudicated as HFREF (n = 100) or HFPEF (n = 100) using
an LVEF cutoff of 50%, according to clinical practice guidelines
[1,2]. Adjudication of New York Heart Association (NYHA)
functional class and primary etiology of HF were determined by
cardiologists blinded to biomarker analyses. Grading of diastolic
dysfunction was performed by blinded members of the authorship
team based on previously published guidelines [16]. LA volume
index, lateral e’ and medial e’ were used as a binary classifier for
diastolic dysfunction, after which E/A ratio, or average E/e’ ratio,
for patients in AFib, was used to ascertain grade in those
determined to have diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction
analyses could not be performed due to poor echocardiographic
visualization in 9 HFPEF patients and 14 HFREF patients, and a
further 1 HFPEF patient and 7 HFREF patients were excluded
from diastolic function analyses due to the presence of severe
mitral regurgitation (MR).
BNP levels were assessed as previously described using an Alere
Triage reagent pack (Alere Inc., Ottawa, ON, CAN) read in an
automated DxI 800 immunoanalyzer (Beckman-Coulter, Full￾erton, CA, USA) at provincial heath laboratories in the province of
Alberta [17]. Serum levels of creatinine and lipid profiles were
available in study subjects’ health records as part of their clinical
evaluation. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls were as follows:
no history of cardiovascular or renal disease, hypertension,
diabetes, or atrial fibrillation; and no prescriptions for antiar￾rhythmics; ACEi; ARB; beta-blockers; digoxin; loop or thiazide
diuretics; or MRA. Exclusion criteria for all study groups were any
of the following: age less than 18 years; known malignancy, with
expected survival time less than one year; pregnancy within the
previous six months; recent cardiac event, including acute MI and
decompensated HF; moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension;
or severe mitral or aortic valvular stenosis.
Plasma biomarker analyses
Blood for plasma analysis was collected during a one-day
baseline enrolment which included the acquisition of the
echocardiograms and ECGs. Patients were rested and sitting
while blood was collected into cooled lithium-heparin tubes, which
were immediately placed on ice prior to plasma fractionation and
deep freezing at #275uC. Commercially-available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for TNF-a, TNFR1, TNFR2
and IL-6 (catalogue no. ’s STA00C, SRT100, SRT200 and
S6050, respectively, R&D Systems, MN, USA) were used as
previously described [18,19]. Absorbance was measured at
450 nm with the wavelength correction set to 540 nm for all
assays using a SpectraMax M5 Plate Reader (Molecular Devices,
CA, USA). Detection rates for the ELISAs were 72.4%, 100%,
100% and 81.2%, respectively. The inter- and intra-assay
coefficients of variation were 13.1% and 9.5% (n = 4); 7.0% and
5.2% (n = 4); 5.3% and 3.5% (n = 4); and 8.0% and 6.3% (n = 4),
respectively.
Plasma ACE2 activity was measured using a previously
established immunofluorescence protocol [20]. Lithium heparin
anti-coagulated platelet-free plasma samples were diluted to a final
ratio of 30:70 in plasma assay buffer: 1 M NaCl (Sigma Chem.
Co., MO, USA), 75 mM Tris-HCl (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and
5 mM ZnCl2 (Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA) at pH 6.5. Assay
buffer was made to contain various protease inhibitors: 10 mM
captopril (ACE inhibitor; Sigma Chem. Co., MO, USA); 5 mM
amastatin (aminopeptidase inhibitor; Sigma Chem. Co., MO,
USA); and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma Chem. Co., MO,
USA) dissolved to achieve a concentration of 10 mM bestatin
(aminopeptidase inhibitor), 1 mM E-64 [N-(trans-Epoxysuccinyl)-
L-leucine-4-guanidinobutylamide; cysteine protease inhibitor],
770 nM pepstatin A (aspartyl protease inhibitor), 154 mM AEBSF
[4-(20aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; serine
protease inhibitor], 75 nM phosphoramidon (neprilysin inhibitor),
15 nM aprotinin (serine protease inhibitor) and 75 nM leupeptin
(cysteine, serine and threonine proteases inhibitor). The use of
protease inhibitors in the buffer solution was meant to ensure that
the fluorogenic substrate and specific ACE2 inhibitor (both
described below), which are integral to the assay, were not cleaved
by other proteases naturally present in human plasma. Samples
were incubated with Dnp-quenched Mca-containing fluorogenic
substrate (catalogue no. ES007, R&D Systems, MN, USA) at a
final concentration of 10 mM at 37uC. To find the fluorescence
increase due to ACE2 activity, plasma samples were assayed both
in the presence and absence of the specific linear ACE2 inhibitor,
DX600 (catalogue no. 002-26, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, CA,
USA). Fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission
settings at 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively, using SpectraMax
M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The maximal
fluorescence increase due to ACE2 activity was determined from
the maximum fluorescence difference between inhibited and
uninhibited aliquots; this was normalized to a standard curve for
Mca-containing fluorescent peptide (catalogue no. M-1975, Ba￾chem, CA, USA) and scaled for time of measurement and plasma
volume over 24 hours, with 1 hour as the baseline. All ACE2
enzymatic activity values herein are expressed in pmol/hr/mL,
which describes the amount of substrate turned over per unit time

per unit volume of plasma. Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of
variation were 10.2% and 7.5% (n = 10), respectively.
Data analysis
Continuous data in tables are expressed as median with
interquartile range (IQR) in parentheses. Continuous data in
figures are expressed as box and whisker plots on a logarithmic
scale to account for non-normal distributions, where boxes
represent IQR with median as a bisecting line, while whiskers
represent the minimum and maximum values. Categorical data
are expressed as percentages. All categorical data were compared
using Pearson Chi-square tests, while continuous variables
analyzed by category were compared using Mann-Whitney U
Test or Kruskal-Wallis Test with Mann-Whitney U Test for
pairwise comparisons, where appropriate. Associations between
categorical factors or continuous covariates and circulating
inflammatory markers were tested using binary logistic or linear
regression analyses, respectively, with log-transformed inflamma￾tory marker levels to account for non-normal distributions.
Associations between increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction or
NYHA functional class and plasma biomarkers were tested using
ordinal logistic regression analyses with log-transformed inflam￾matory marker levels. Forest plots are used to graphically display
results from logistic regression analyses. A p-value,0.05 was
considered significant for all statistical analyses. Statistical analyses
were conducted using SPSS Statistics Version 20 (IBM, NY, USA).
Obesity was defined as BMI$30 kg/m2 per WHO criteria [21].
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the
revised four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
equation [22]. Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined
as left-ventricular mass index (LVMI) $115 g/m2 for males and $
95 g/m2 for females per previously published criteria [23].
Results
Baseline clinical profile and assessments of heart function
Demographic and clinical information for the control, HFPEF
and HFREF groups is displayed in Table 1. In this study, the HF
patient populations recapitulated observations in previous reports
[3–5,24]. The study subjects were predominantly of white race in
all study groups (Table 1). HFPEF patients were older (p = 0.003),
and significantly more were obese (p = 0.016) and hypertensive
than HFREF patients, while neither HF group had different
gender ratios (p = 0.210), histories of diabetes, peripheral vascular
disease (p = 0.234) or atrial fibrillation (AFib; Table 1). Interest￾ingly, total cholesterol (p = 0.774), triglycerides (p = 0.656) and
total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (p = 0.187)
were not significantly different between HF phenotypes, despite
differences in obesity prevalence (Table 1). Ischemic etiology was
more prevalent in HFREF than HFPEF, but both groups were on
evidence-based therapeutic regimens (Table 1). Importantly, drugs
that can affect inflammation were comparably used by the two HF
groups: NSAID use was equivalent and statin use was not
significantly different (p = 0.438; Table 1). NYHA functional class
distribution was also not significantly different between the HFPEF
and HFREF groups (Table 1).
Heart rates did not differ significantly between controls or the
two HF groups; however, a significantly greater number of HFPEF
patients were in AFib on the day of study than HFREF patients
(p = 0.018; Table 2). The HFREF group had significantly lower
LVEF compared to control and HFPEF groups, while both
HFPEF and HFREF had greater LV posterior wall thickness
(LVPW; p,0.001 for both) and mass index (LVMI; p,0.001 for
both); left atrial volume index (LA volume index; p,0.001 for
both); and average E/e’ ratio (p,0.001 for both) compared to
control (Table 2). LVPW (p,0.05), and left ventricular end
diastolic and systolic dimensions (LVEDD and LVESD, respec￾tively; p,0.001 for both) were significantly different between the
two HF groups (Table 2). The distributions of grades of diastolic
dysfunction were also significantly different (p = 0.043), which
might be due to the high prevalence of AFib acting as a
confounder in this analysis (Table 2). Significantly more HFREF
subjects had left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than HFPEF
subjects (p,0.001; Table 2).
Circulating inflammatory markers in healthy control,
HFPEF and HFREF
Compared to control, plasma levels of TNFa were only
significantly elevated in HPFEF, while levels of TNFR1 and
TNFR2 were significantly elevated in both HFPEF and HFREF
(Figure 1A–C). Meanwhile, IL-6 was not significantly different
between control and the HF groups (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
TNFR2 was significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to HFREF,
while TNFa and TNFR1 were non-significantly elevated in
HFPEF (Figure 1A–C). We explored the relationship between age,
eGFR, sex, obesity, LVH, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status,
peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation with
TNFa, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 in the combined HF group
(Table 3). Advanced age was significantly associated with elevated
TNFR1 and TNFR2, and low eGFR was significantly associated
with elevated TNFa in addition to its two receptors (Table 3).
TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 increased differentially in response to
smoking status or comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and
diabetes, but were always associated with at least two covariates,
while IL-6 was not associated with any covariate (Table 3). Sex,
obesity and LVH were not significantly associated with any of the
inflammatory markers (Table 3).
Modulators of inflammatory markers in HFPEF and HFREF
We investigated how the inflammatory markers in this study
related to two clinically-relevant and commonly-used ordinal
quantifications of disease status in HF: grade of diastolic
dysfunction and NYHA functional class. We investigated these
associations using ordinal logistic regression analyses. Elevated
TNFR2 was significantly associated with increasing grade of
diastolic dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF, while TNFR1
was not associated with diastolic dysfunction in either HF group
(Figure 2A). Interestingly, elevated TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels
were significantly associated with increasing NYHA functional
class in both HPFEF and HFREF (Figure 2A). Neither TNFa, nor
IL-6 were significantly associated with diastolic dysfunction or
symptom severity in either HFPEF or HFREF (data not shown).
LA volume index was not associated with plasma TNFR1 or
TNFR2 levels in HFPEF (r = 0.110, p = 0.298; and r = 0.170,
p = 0.105, respectively) or HFREF (r = 0.083, p = 0.443; and
r = 0.056, p = 0.607, respectively). Plasma levels of TNFR1 and
TNFR2 were weakly, but significantly, associated with average E/
e’ ratio in HFPEF (Figure 2B & C), but not HFREF (r = 0.215,
p = 0.053; and r = 0.112, p = 0.318, respectively). Given that AFib
can confound diastolic dysfunction analyses, we investigated
associations between TNFR1 or TNFR2 and LA volume index
or average E/e’ ratio, as alternative measures of diastolic function
that can be used for patients in AFib [25].
Increased activity of TNFa converting enzyme (TACE), a
sheddase involved in proteolytic processing of TNFa, TNFRs, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) might represent a
mechanism of increased circulating TNFa and TNFRs in HF
[26,27]. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory homologue of angiotensin￾Elevated Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptor 2 in HFPEF
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99495

converting enzyme (ACE) and a major regulator of endothelial
function and myocardial fibrosis [28–30]. Since the membrane￾bound localization of TACE poses a limitation in assessing its
levels or activity in the plasma, we measured plasma ACE2 activity
as a surrogate, as it increases with increased TACE activity [31].
Previous reports of plasma ACE2 activity showed an association
with clinically diagnosed HFREF, symptom severity and worsen￾ing clinical outcomes [20,32]. In our HFPEF cohort, plasma
ACE2 activity was significantly elevated relative to control

Discussion
In this comparative analysis of healthy controls, and HF patients
with preserved or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction, we
found that our cohorts recapitulated previous characterizations,
whereby, HFPEF subjects were more likely to be older,
hypertensive and obese [3–5,24]. Similarly, AFib was prevalent
in both HF groups, which follows the trend observed in the
MAGGIC meta-analysis [5]. Furthermore, the primary etiology of
HF was much less likely to be ischemic in the HFPEF group.
Despite differences in comorbidities, age and HF etiology the
NYHA class distribution was similar between HFREF and
HFPEF, which indicates that the two patient populations
experienced significant burden of disease. Additionally, both
groups had cardiac hypertrophy and exhibited marked diastolic
dysfunction. In patients without marked systolic dysfunction, a
greater prevalence of comorbidities might account for the
similarity in symptoms between HFPEF and HFREF.
Improvement in exercise capacity in a cohort of HFPEF
patients after an exercise training regimen was largely mediated by
peripheral improvements, which suggests a systemic component to
HFPEF, including skeletal muscle dysregulation [33]. Indeed, a
recent model of HFPEF suggests that comorbidity-mediated
systemic inflammation, results in coronary microvascular endo￾thelial dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and
skeletal muscle dysregulation to produce the HFPEF phenotype
[6]. We investigated TNFa and its receptors (TNFR1 and
TNFR2) as one component of comorbidity-driven inflammation,
and included IL-6 as non-TNF-family cytokine for comparison.
We expand on previous work in HF: our data showed that levels of
TNFa and TNFR1 were significantly increased in HFPEF relative
control but not HFREF, while TNFR2 was significantly increased
relative to both control and HFREF [14]. Plasma IL-6 levels were
very comparable between HFPEF and HFREF, which suggests
that TNFa-mediated inflammation might be a point of patho￾physiological difference between HF phenotypes.

Elevated Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptor 2 in HFPEF
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99495

We found that low eGFR, hypertension, smoking status and
history of atrial fibrillation were significantly associated with
elevated TNFa levels, while elevated TNFR1 levels were
associated with aging, low eGFR, hypertension, diabetes and
PVD, and elevated TNFR2 levels were associated with aging, low
eGFR, diabetes and atrial fibrillation. The advanced age and
greater prevalence of comorbidities in the HFPEF population
could drive the observed elevation in circulating inflammatory
markers relative to HFREF. Indeed, non-cardiac comorbidities
are more prevalent in HFPEF, with a larger fraction of adverse
clinical outcomes attributable to non-cardiac events compared to
HFREF [34]. Likewise, increased TNFa-axis inflammation has
been linked to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and all￾cause outcomes in HF [18,35,36]. Altogether, these data are
congruent with the paradigm for HFPEF that includes comorbid￾ities-driven dysregulation of TNFa-mediated signaling [6,34].
Our finding that circulating TNFR2 levels are significantly
associated with increasing average E/e’ ratio and grade of diastolic
dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF, suggests a greater role
for TNFa-mediated inflammation in this cohort. However, we
found that TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated
with increasing NYHA class in both HF phenotypes, which shows
that part of the HFREF phenotype can also be attributed to
inflammation. The association of diastolic dysfunction and
symptoms with TNFR2 in HFPEF is consistent with findings in
experimental models, as the TNFR1/TNFR2 axis is involved in
mediating divergent effects: TNFR1 has been implicated in
adverse cardiac remodeling and adipogenesis, while TNFR2

Elevated Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Receptor 2 in HFPEF
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99495

antagonizes the pathological effects of TNFR1, and also stimulates
angiogenesis [37–40]. TNFR1 and TNFR2 also mediate opposite
effects on phospholamban and SERCA2, key Ca2+ handling
proteins involved in myocardial relaxation [37,41]. An increase in
circulating TNFR2 levels might reflect a loss of protective
signaling mechanisms due to tissue shedding of TNFR2, thereby
leading to the correlation between circulating TNFR2 levels and
diastolic dysfunction and symptoms in HFPEF.
The differential role of TNFRs might explain why TNFa is not
associated with function or symptoms: the variable response to
TNFa is mediated at the receptor level. Congruent with a recent
report, we found TNFa was not strongly associated with either HF
phenotype; however, Marti et al. implicate TNFR1, while our
study implicates TNFR2 in HFPEF [13]. The key difference
between the two studies is that Marti et al. explored risk of incident
HF, while we examined existing HF populations. Indeed, we
found TNFR1 to be associated with the greatest number of HF
risk factors, which is congruent with a role for TNFR1 in
precipitating incident HFPEF. Meanwhile, our data show that
TNFR2 might then be a better biomarker for gauging severity of
established HFPEF.
Circulating fragments of TNFa, TNFR1 and TNFR2 are
generated from full, transmembrane proteins through the activity
of TACE [26,27]. We hypothesized that increased circulating

levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 might reflect increased activity of
TACE. ACE2 is also a substrate of TACE, and plasma ACE2
activity increases in conjunction with increased TACE activity
[26,31]. Since TACE is membrane-bound, as a surrogate of
TACE-activity we measured plasma ACE2 activity in HFPEF
patients relative to healthy controls. Previous work showed a
significant association between ACE2 and symptom severity and
adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HFREF [20,32]. We
found significantly elevated plasma ACE2 activity in HFPEF as
compared to healthy controls, but no association to diastolic
dysfunction or symptoms. This is congruent with the idea that
elevated ACE2 activity is a consequence of the drivers of HFPEF,
rather than an effector as may be the case in HFREF [20,32].
Conclusion
Taking our data together with previous reports indicates that
the TACE/TNFa/TNFR1/TNFR2 inflammatory axis is a part of
the pathogenesis of HFPEF [7–10,37–40]. In the context of the
failure of TNFa antagonism as a therapeutic tool in HF, our data
suggest that a downstream approach involving TNFR1 inhibition
or TNFR2 potentiation may represent a more effective therapeutic
approach for patients with HFPEF [42].
Limitations
Our study, while larger than most other studies that compared
levels of TNFa and its receptors in HFPEF versus HFREF, is still
relatively small in terms of clinical studies. Indeed, TNFa might
also be informative with respect to differentiating HFPEF from
HFREF, but our study cannot resolve whether this is the case. In
addition, the results reported herein represent a single cross￾section across healthy controls, and HFPEF and HFREF patients,
so follow-up measurements are not included, nor are outcomes
data. Further studies with a longitudinal component will be
important for implicating various molecules or pathways in the
pathophysiological development of HF, for which work by Marti et
al. is a strong contribution [13]. Finally, our results only provide
correlative evidence of whether these biochemical markers are
primary mediators of the HF syndrome, or end-effectors of
pathogenic processes. Indeed, while a conglomerate of evidence
points towards an interplay between plasma and tissue levels for
TNFR1 and TNFR2—shedding increases plasma levels at the
expense of tissue levels—direct tissue and plasma comparisons
from the same subjects will be necessary to determine the relative
effects of proteolytic processing and changes in expression.
