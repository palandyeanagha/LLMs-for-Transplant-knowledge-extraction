Acute pancreatitis: a lethal disease of increasing
incidence
A P CORFIELD, M J COOPER, AND R C N WILLIAMSON
From the University Department ofSurgery, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol
SUMMARY Between 1968 and 1979 650 patients in the Bristol clinical area suffered 737 attacks of
acute pancreatitis. Sex distribution was approximately equal and mean age was 60 years.
Comparison with the previous decade shows an increase in mean annual incidence of first attacks
from 53 8 to 73-0 cases per million population. Case mortality was unchanged at 20%. In no less
than 35% of fatal cases the diagnosis was first made at necropsy. Gall stones were detected in
50% of first attacks, predominantly in women. The proportion of alcoholics (8% overall)
increased three-fold during the period of the study. In 23% of cases no aetiological cause was
identified. Eighty patients suffered 99 recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, with a mortality
rate (12%) that was not significantly lower than that of the first attack. Neglected gall stones
accounted for 51% of these subsequent attacks.
Wide differences in the incidence of acute pan￾creatitis have been reported both within and be￾tween countries. -3 These fluctuations may reflect
environmental differences, for example in alcohol
consumption, cholelithiasis or even the hardness of
water,' but published series are often difficult to
compare. The criteria of diagnosis, the diligence
with which case notes and necropsy records have
been retrieved, and selection and bias in the local
population have either differed or not been men￾tioned.
Trapnell and Duncan's comprehensive review of
acute pancreatitis in the Bristol clinical area from
1950-694 reported an average yearly incidence of
first attacks of 54 cases per million population, with
a mortality rate of 9 per million. We have updated
this review to 1979 using data from the same Bristol
hospitals, which drain catchment areas in urban
Bristol and the surrounding rural parts of Avon,
Somerset, and Gloucestershire. We have retained
the same diagnostic criteria as Trapnell and Duncan
and the same methods of patient retrieval, so far as
changes in biochemical assay and hospital activity
auditing would allow.

Bristol area presenting between 1 January 1968 and
31 December 1979 were assessed. An overlap with
the earlier review for 1968 and 1969 was necessary,
as patients presenting during these years had not
been included in the previous statistical analysis. As
before, several approaches were used to maximise
case retrieval. The hospital activity analysis of the
South Western Regional Health Authority was used
to identify most cases; all the hospitals serving the
Bristol clinical area were included in the computer
search. The analysis coding used was 577.0 (acute
pancreatitis), and the same code was used to
calculate national returns for both incidence and
mortality rate. A search of the death certificate
records at the Coroner's office revealed a small
number of otherwise unrecorded cases. Lastly,
during the period under review various clinical trials
in acute pancreatitis have been undertaken in
Bristol,5 6 and details from these were included.
There were no direct referrals from outside the
catchment area. A few patients were visitors, but
because all of these were in the area at the onset of
their attack, they have been included in the survey.
The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was only
accepted if there was a consistent clinical picture
supported by biochemical, operative or necropsy
evidence of the disease. Two methods of serum
amylase assay were used in the area hospitals during
the period of survey. For conformity with Trapnell
and Duncan4 a level of 1000 Somogyi units per 100
ml (normal <160) was deemed equivalent to 2000

international units per litre (Phadebas: normal
<300), after several sera had been studied by both
methods and a standard curve derived (r=0 997).
These values were the minimum necessary for the
diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Obvious pancreatic
or peri-pancreatic inflammation was necessary for
operative or necropsy diagnosis.
Biliary radiology was usually carried out within six
weeks of an attack of pancreatitis, though a few
patients were not investigated because of either
clinical reticence or patient non-compliance. Alco￾holism was defined as a regular intake of 4 pints of
beer or a third of a bottle of spirits per day.
The catchment population has been derived from
statistics supplied by the South Western Regional
Health Authority's medical statistics department:
between 1968-79 there were 8 745 000 person-years
at risk. County and local council boundaries have
twice undergone extensive reviews during the 12
year study period, necessitating estimation of the
population at risk to the nearest thousand persons.
Statistical probabilities were calculated using the x2
test.
Results
INCIDENCE
There were 737 documented attacks of acute pan￾creatitis in 650 patients (332 women, 318 men), with
a mean age of 60 years (range 3-94 years). Six
hundred and thirty eight of these were first attacks
of acute pancreatitis, and the remaining 99 were
recurrent episodes. Twelve patients in the recurrent
group had sustained their first attack either outside
the region or before 1968. When related to the
general population at risk, the mean annual inci￾dence of a first attack of acute pancreatitis was 73 0
cases per million, with a range of 48-9-111-2 cases
per million. The incidence increased from a mean of
55 1 for the six years 1968-73 to a mean of 90 5 for
the similar period 1974-79 (Fig. 1). This rise is
reflected in an increase in hospital cases from 35 in
1968 to 82 in 1979 (Table 1).
MORTALITY
The outcome was fatal in 125 of the 638 first attacks
(mortality rate 19.6%), whereas there were only 12
deaths in the recurrent group of 99 (12-1%:
p<008). The absolute death rate in relation to the
population at risk allows certain comparisons with
national statistics, although it must be remembered
that diagnostic criteria may vary. Analysis of the
Registrar General's figures for the years involved7
shows that there were 588 418 600 person-years at
risk in England and Wales and 7323 deaths from
acute pancreatitis, giving a mean annual death rate

of 12-4 per million. These figures include both first
and recurrent attacks and contrast with a local mean
annual death rate of 15-7 per million (8 745 000
person-years at risk and 137 deaths).
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis was established by a consistent clinical
picture and serum amylase estimation in 622 cases,
at laparotomy in 71 cases and at necropsy alone in
43. The remaining patient had a clinical diagnosis of
acute pancreatitis proven at necropsy despite a
normal serum amylase. These necropsy cases ac￾counted for 35 2% of the primary attack fatalities.
Four cases were diagnosed at a Coroner's post￾mortem examination after death at home. The other
39 patients died in hospital with various other
premortem diagnoses (Table 2). Thirty five of the
laparotomy cases and eight of those diagnosed at
necropsy had a serum amylase of less than 1000
Somogyi units per 100 ml on admission. Thus
amylase estimation had a 6-5% false negative rate.
Eleven of these 43 cases had amylase levels >800

AGE AND SEX
Patients with a first attack of acute pancreatitis were
of mean age 60-0 years (range 3-94 years). Sex
distribution was almost equal. Three hundred and
twenty seven female patients were of mean age 61 2
years (range 3-92 years), and 311 male patients were
of mean age 59-2 years (range 6-94 years). Fatal
acute pancreatitis occurred in 102 cases aged 60 or
over (28%), whereas there were only 23 fatalities
below this age (9%; p<0001; Fig. 2). There were
two children under the age of 10, one of whom had a
defect in cell mediated immunity. We have excluded
another two children with probable pancreatitis
complicating mumps. They had appropriate symp￾toms and signs, but serum amylase levels only
reached 600 and 800 Somogyi units per 100 ml.
AETIOLOGY
Gall stones were detected in 319 (50%) of the
patients with first attacks, with a 60:40 female
predominance (Table 3). Rather more men with
biliary tract disease died than women (17 vs 10%:
p<0.08). In 113 patients there was laparotomy or
necropsy evidence of common bile duct stones,
which were mobile in 99 cases and impacted at the
ampulla of Vater in 14 cases. Death was much
commoner among patients with impacted stones
than those with mobile stones (71 vs 11%:
p<O-OOl). One patient developed acute pancreatitis
immediately after an intravenous cholangiogram
which showed ductal calculi.
The next largest aetiological group comprised
those in whom no obvious factor could be identified
despite either radiological investigation, laparotomy
or autopsy. This idiopathic group comprised 148
patients (23%), with 29 deaths evenly distributed

Alcoholism caused a total of 51 first attacks, of
which 45 (88%) were in men. In the four-year
period 1968-71 there were six attacks of acute
pancreatitis ascribed to alcohol, between 1972 and
1975 there were 15, and from 1976 to 1979 there
were 30 attacks. These figures show a progressive

Acute pancreatitis: a lethal disease of increasing incidence
increase in alcohol-related acute pancreatitis from
3.7% of attacks to 10-8%.
Twenty patients suffered their first attack of acute
pancreatitis after a surgical operation or investiga￾tion. Relevant procedures included transduodenal
sphincteroplasty (n=4), vagotomy and pyloroplasty
(three), gastrectomy (three), right hemicolectomy
(two), translumbar aortography (two), and one each
for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreato￾graphy (ERCP), aspiration biopsy of the pancreas,
cholecystectomy (alone), bilateral adrenalectomy,
division of adhesions and cardiopulmonary bypass.
Postoperative pancreatitis was fatal in 11 of 20 cases
(55%), including all three gastrectomies and three
of the four sphincteroplasties.
Acute pancreatitis was associated with malignant
neoplasia in 11 patients, usually as a terminal event.
There were three pancreatic carcinomas, one hepa￾toma, one gall bladder carcinoma, one leukaemia
and five peripancreatic secondaries. Although 24
patients (nine deaths) were taking corticosteroids,
10 of these had other aetiological factors. Likewise
21 patients (nine deaths) had diabetes mellitus but
10 had other factors. Hypothermia (<34°C) was
recorded on admission in eight patients, half of
whom died. Four patients developed acute pan￾creatitis during pregnancy or in the puerperium;
three had biliary disease and one was an alcoholic.
RECURRENT PANCREATITIS
Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis occurred in
68 of the 513 (13%) patients who survived a first
attack during the period under review. Another 12
patients had a previous attack of acute pancreatitis
conforming to our diagnostic criteria, either outside
the Bristol area or before 1968. The mean age, at
their first attack, of patients with recurrent disease
was 53-5 years (range 17-88 years). The total of 80
patients (44 women, 36 men) suffered 99 recurrent
attacks; 13 had three attacks and another three had
four attacks. In all, there were 12 deaths in this
group (12.1%, Table 4).
Most recurrent attacks (51%) were in patients
with cholelithiasis, who were either awaiting chole￾cystectomy or in whom operation had been declined
by patient or surgeon. Eighteen patients (two
deaths) had stones in the common bile duct. In only
one of these was a stone impacted at the ampulla of
Vater, and this patient made an uneventful post￾operative recovery.
Recurrent attacks were documented in 12 of the
38 male alcoholics who survived a first attack during
the period of review. One man had two further
attacks, and one had had the first attack before
1968. These alcoholic patients had no evidence of
chronic pancreatitis. Lastly, three octogenarian

Discussion
INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY
The mean annual incidence of acute pancreatitis in
Britain has variously been reported between 482 and
2383 cases per million population. For valid geog￾raphical comparisons, all cases of the disease occur￾ring in each area must be included, using the same
diagnostic criteria. Prospective surveys have the
drawback of excluding cases not presenting to
hospital clinicians. It is well recognised that different
areas have different patterns of disease, so that
extrapolation of local figures to obtain national
statistics is fallible.
As acute pancreatitis is seldom treated by early
operation, clinical suspicion of the disease is gener￾ally confirmed by hyperamylasaemia. The precise
concentration of serum amylase that can be taken as
diagnostic is controversial, however. The values
used in the present study were chosen to permit
direct comparison with the previous Bristol survey.4
They represent between six to seven times the upper
level of normal in our laboratories. Similar rises are
rarely obtained in other conditions,8 9 most of which
demand prompt laparotomy. By contrast, the false
negative rate of 6 5% suggests that we have over￾looked some patients with mild oedematous
pancreatitis.
Compared with Trapnell and Duncan's previous
report, our survey shows a 26% increase in acute
pancreatitis in Bristol. Local interest in the disease
because of clinical trials seems unlikely to explain
this increase, because the proportion of mild cases
has remained unchanged. The incidence of acute
pancreatitis in relation to age, sex and predisposing
factors agrees with other published British
series;2 4 T 11 more women had underlying chole￾727

lithiasis and more men were alcoholics.
Many reports have suggested that the mortality
rate of acute pancreatitis is decreasing,5 612 13
owing perhaps to earlier diagnosis and treatment
following heightened awareness of the disease; but
being prospective in nature, these studies have
overlooked cases in which pancreatitis was un￾suspected before death. 14 In our survey, a little
more than one third of the patients who died were
not diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis pre￾mortem. If these patients are excluded, a mortality
rate of 13-6% is obtained. Nevertheless, it is
salutary to note that the true rate of 19-6%, which
varied but little from year to year, has not improved
since 1961-67,4 despite a number of recent thera￾peutic trials and advances in intensive therapy.
AETIOLOGY
The proportion of pancreatitis patients with gall
stones (50%) has not altered over a 30 year period in
Bristol.4 The high incidence of common bile duct
stones (35%) supports the hypothesis that the
causative mechanism in gall stone pancreatitis is the
passage of a calculus through the common channel
formed by pancreatic and common bile ducts, with
consequent reflux of bile or duodenal juice into the
pancreatic duct. 15-17 Impaction of a stone at the
ampulla of Vater in 56% of necropsies showing gall
stone pancreatitis lends credence to this theory and
suggests that early operative intervention should be
considered if this condition is suspected.
Alcoholism appears to be a much commoner
cause of acute pancreatitis elsewhere in Britain and
abroad,9 1821 although it has steadily increased over
the last 30 years in Bristol.4 Our findings confirm
that postoperative pancreatitis usually follows upper
abdominal surgery and is a dangerous disease with a
55% chance of death.22 The aetiological relevance
of steroids is disputed;4 23 nearly half our patients on
steroids had other predisposing factors. Our data
suggest that diabetes is no more prevalent in acute
pancreatitis than in the general population despite a
previous report to the contrary.20 Pre-existing
diabetes, however, does increase the risk of death
from 19 to 43%. Concomitant hypothermia is even
more lethal, though it could either precede or follow
the attack of acute pancreatitis.24
Other aetiological associations of acute pancrea￾titis, such as hyperlipidaemia and hyperparathyroid￾ism, make up an expected small percentage of
cases.14 18 20 Like others,4 25 we have found no
convincing evidence that pregnancy is a relevant
factor. There was only one case of acute pancreatitis
after ERCP, though the reported incidence is
1-2%.26 Because over 900 ERCP examinations
were performed during the study period, several
mild attacks of pancreatitis were probably missed.
RECURRENT ATTACKS
Though the second and subsequent attacks of acute
pancreatitis seem to be less dangerous than the first,
this difference is not as great as originally sug￾gested.4 Delayed cholecystectomy is still the major
factor in recurrent pancreatitis, accounting for half
the cases; subsequent attacks of gall stone pancrea￾titis are almost as lethal as the first attack. Likewise,
in idiopathic pancreatitis the mortality rate of
subsequent attacks is similar to that of the initial
attack. After one attack of acute alcoholic pan￾creatitis some patients develop a chronic relapsing
disease with functional impairment; others suffer
recurrent acute attacks, though these did not prove
fatal in our experience.
