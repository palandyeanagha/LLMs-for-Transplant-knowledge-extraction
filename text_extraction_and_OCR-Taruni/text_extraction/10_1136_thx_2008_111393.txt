Abstract
Background: Measures of oxygenation have not been assessed for
prognostic significance in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung
disease (SSc-ILD).
Methods: 83 subjects with SSc-ILD performed a maximal
cardiopulmonary exercise test with an arterial line. The agreement
between peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo2) and arterial oxygen
saturation (Sao2) was examined and survival differences between
subgroups of subjects stratified on Spo2 were analysed. Cox
proportional hazards analyses were used to examine the prognostic
capabilities of Spo2.
Results: At maximal exercise the mean (SD) difference between
Spo2 and Sao2 was 2.98 (2.98) and only 15 subjects had a
difference of >4 points. The survival of subjects with SSc-ILD
whose maximum exercise Spo2 (Spo2max) fell below 89% or whose
Spo2max fell >4 points from baseline was worse than subjects in
comparator groups (log rank p = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). The
hazard of death during the median 7.1 years of follow-up was 2.4
times greater for subjects whose Spo2max fell below 89% (hazard
ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.9, p = 0.02) or whose Spo2max fell >4


points from baseline (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.0, p = 0.02).
Conclusion: In patients with SSc-ILD, Spo2 is an adequate
reflection of Sao2 and radial arterial lines need not be inserted
during cardiopulmonary exercise tests in these patients. Given the
ease of measurement and its prognostic value, Spo2 should be
considered as a meaningful clinical and research outcome in
patients with SSc-ILD.
