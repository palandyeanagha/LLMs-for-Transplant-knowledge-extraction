Abstract
Introduction: Rapid establishment of functional blood vessels is a prerequisite for successful tissue engineering.
During vascular development, endothelial cells (ECs) and perivascular cells assemble into a complex regulating
proliferation of ECs, vessel diameter and production of extracellular matrix proteins. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to establish an endothelial-perivascular complex in
tissue-engineered constructs comprising ECs and MSCs.
Methods: Primary human ECs and MSCs were seeded onto poly(L-lactide-co-1,5-dioxepan-2-one) (poly(LLA￾co-DXO)) scaffolds and grown in dynamic culture before subcutaneous implantation in immunocompromised mice
for 1 and 3 weeks. Cellular activity, angiogenic stimulation and vascular assembly in cell/scaffold constructs seeded
with ECs or ECs/MSCs in a 5:1 ratio was monitored with real-time RT-PCR, ELISA and immunohistochemical
microscopy analysis.
Results: A quiescent phenotype of ECs was generated, by adding MSCs to the culture system. Decreased
proliferation of ECs, in addition to up-regulation of selected markers for vascular maturation was demonstrated.
Baseline expression of VEGFa was higher for MSCs compared with EC (P <0.001), with subsequent up-regulated
VEGFa-expression for EC/MSC constructs before (P <0.05) and after implantation (P <0.01). Furthermore, an
inflammatory response with CD11b + cells was generated from implantation of human cells. At the end of the
3 week experimental period, a higher vascular density was shown for both cellular constructs compared with empty
control scaffolds (P <0.01), with the highest density of capillaries being generated in constructs comprising both ECs
and MSCs.
Conclusions: Induction of a quiescent phenotype of ECs associated with vascular maturation can be achieved by
co-seeding with MSCs. Hence, MSCs can be appropriate perivascular cells for tissue-engineered constructs.
Introduction
In tissue engineering, inadequate vascular supply is a limit￾ing factor for the reconstruction of larger defects. The in￾corporation of bioengineered microvessels derived from
vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in cell/scaffold constructs,
is an approach attempting to ensure appropriate oxygen￾ation of developing tissue. However, bioengineered vascu￾lature must reach a physiologically functional level in order
to supply oxygen and nutrients effectively and depends on
supporting cells for stability and maintenance [1].
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are investigated pri￾marily as progenitor cells capable of regenerating bone,
cartilage and adipose tissue, thus being an attractive cell
source for tissue engineering. However, implantation of
cells into a hypoxic microenvironment might hamper
the success of cell based tissue regeneration, and in￾creasing efforts to pre-vascularize constructs with ECs
have, therefore, been made.
Milestone discoveries in the study of MSCs are the fi￾broblastic colony-forming units initiated by single cells
[2], the multilineage potential [3] and, more recently, a
shift in view towards MSCs as tissue-specific progenitors
residing in close proximity to the microvasculature of
various organs [4]. The latter might serve as a rationale

for MSCs as a potential perivascular cell in pre￾vascularized constructs for tissue regeneration.
Pericytes are vascular mural cells of microvessels res￾iding alongside ECs within the vascular basement mem￾brane [5]. In the process of blood vessel development,
perivascular cells are recruited to tubular ECs, and the
endothelial-perivascular complex produces extracellular
basement membrane proteins leading to increasingly
mature blood vessels [6]. The transition from vascular
morphogenesis to a stabilized vasculature, therefore, de￾pends on perivascular cells [7], the absence of which
might lead to non-functional immature vessels [8]. Peri￾vascular cells establish specific focal contacts with the
adjacent endothelium [5], and it has been shown that
their presence is beneficial for EC survival [9]. In fact,
interactions with pericytes might regulate EC prolifera￾tion and differentiation [5]. Mesenchymal precursor cells
have shown the ability to differentiate into smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) [10,11], but the ability of MSCs to
differentiate into non-skeletal lineages is controversial
[4]. Although SMCs can support the development of
functional engineered microvessels [12], they lack the
ability to regenerate skeletal tissues. MSCs might, there￾fore, be a more appropriate cell for tissue engineering
applications, where a functional vasculature alongside
cells with regenerative potential is required. Previous
studies have shown that endothelial microvascular net￾works can be generated in vitro with supportive cells
other than SMCs, including fibroblasts and MSCs
[13-15].
This study assessed the effect of MSCs on the vascular
endothelium in two- and three-dimensional culture sys￾tems, as well as after subcutaneous implantation. Results
show that quiescent ECs and vascular maturation was
induced by the presence of MSCs. Furthermore, both
cellular constructs induced higher vascular density than
control scaffolds, with the highest density of capillaries
generated from co-implantation of ECs and MSCs.
Methods
Cell expansion and characterization
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased
from Lonza (CloneticsW, Walkersville, MD, US) and
expanded in endothelial cell growth medium (EGMW)
(Lonza) containing 500 ml endothelial cell basal medium
and supplements: Fetal bovine serum (FBS) 10 ml, bovine
brain extract (BBE) 2 ml, human epidermal growth factor
(hEGF) 0.5 ml, hydrocortisone 0.5 ml and GA-1000
0.5 ml. Primary human bone-marrow derived stem cells
(MSCs) were purchased from StemCell Technologies
(Vancouver, BC, Canada), and expanded in MesenCultW
complete medium (StemCell Technologies). The purity of
MSCs was evaluated by flow cytometry, were it was found
that >90% of the cells expressed CD29, CD44, CD105 and
CD166 while <1% expressed CD14, CD34 and CD45. Cells
no older than passage five were used, and all cells were
cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Two- and three-dimensional culture systems
To investigate morphology in vitro, 105 ECs were cultured
in six-well plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) in mono￾culture or in co-culture with MSCs in a 5:1 ratio in EGMW
culture medium (Lonza). After one week, ECs were stained
with TRITC-conjugated UEA-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, US) and MSCs with FITC mouse anti-human CD90
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, US). In order to determine
the number of viable ECs, cells in co-culture were sepa￾rated with CD31 Endothelial Cell DynabeadsW (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, US) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. ECs were stained with 0.4% trypan blue and counted
with a CountessW Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen).
Previous publications have described the production of
poly(LLA-co-DXO) scaffolds [16], and the seeding of cell/
scaffold constructs for in vivo implantation [17]. Briefly,
scaffolds were incubated overnight in EGMW (Lonza) cul￾ture medium. The next day, each scaffold was seeded with
5 × 105 cells, ECs or ECs/MSCs in a 5:1 ratio. An orbital
shaker (EppendorfW, Hamburg, Germany) was applied for
five minutes at 1,000 rpm to facilitate homogenous dis￾tribution of cells [18]. Scaffolds were transferred to separ￾ate spinner flask bioreactors (Wheaton Science, Millville,
NJ, US) the next day and grown in dynamic three￾dimensional culture at 50 rpm for one week in EGMW
culture medium (Lonza) for both experimental groups.
A dermal skin puncher was used to puncture six mm
discs, which were either implanted in vivo or processed
for analysis.
Surgical implantation
All animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian
Animal Research Authority (Local approval number:
3029) and conducted according to the European Conven￾tion for the Protection of Vertebrates used for Scientific
Purposes. Sixteen non-obese severe combined immunode￾ficient (NOD/SCID) mice (Gade Institute, University of
Bergen/Taconic Farms) six- to eight-weeks old were used
for implantation of cell/scaffold constructs. An intramus￾cular injection of 20 μl 1:2 Rompun (Xylazin, 20 mg/ml)
(Bayer Health Care, Leverkusen, Germany) and Narketan
(Ketamin) (Vétoquinol, Lure, France) was given to
anesthetize the animals. A 2.5 cm incision was made on
the back of each animal, providing sufficient space for sub￾cutaneous implantation of scaffolds. Vetbond™ Tissue
Adhesive (n-butyl cyanoacrylate) (3M™, St. Paul, MN, US)
was applied for wound closure. Samples were retrieved
after one and three weeks implantation, following euthan￾asia with deep isoflurane anesthesia (Schering Plough,
Kenilworth, NJ, US) and cervical dislocation. Depending

on the following analysis, samples were either frozen in li￾quid nitrogen (RNA-isolation), fixed in 4% paraformalde￾hyde (PFA) (paraffin embedding) or embedded in
optimal cutting temperature (OCT) tissue-tech (Sakura
Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) (cryosectioning).
Real-time RT-PCR
For in vitro and in vivo evaluations of gene expression,
extraction of RNA was performed with an E.Z.N.A.W
Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, US). A
Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific Nano￾Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, US) was used
to quantify and evaluate RNA purity. A high capacity
cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA,
US) was applied for reverse transcription reactions,
where total RNA (1,000 ng) was mixed with nuclease
free water, reverse transcriptase buffer, random primers,
dNTP and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time RT-PCR
was performed on a StepOne™ real time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems) with standard enzyme and cycling
conditions, and cDNA corresponding to 10 ng mRNA
in each reaction, prepared in duplicate for each target
gene. Human TaqmanW gene expression assays were
angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1), angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), α￾smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), SM22α, ki67, proliferat￾ing cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), CD31, von Willebrand
Factor (vWF), vascular endothelial growth factor-a
(VEGFa), fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), platelet
derived growth factor-b (PDGFb) and macrophage col￾ony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Mouse TaqmanW gene
expression assays were VEGFa, ANG-1, ANG-2, α-SMA
and ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1).
Histological evaluation
Embedding with OCT tissue-tech (Sakura Finetek) was
done before samples were frozen with 2-methylbutan
ReagentPlusW (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US) and
liquid nitrogen. A Leica CM 3050S microtome (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to make
8 μm sections at −24°C. Fixation in 4% PFA was used for
samples intended for paraffin sectioning before embed￾ding. Sections acquired from the middle part of the sam￾ples were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. CD11b- and CD31-staining was performed
with rat anti-mouse primary antibodies (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, US) in a 1:200 dilution for four hours at
room temperature, with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rat
secondary antibody in a 1:500 dilution for two hours.
Circumference and area fraction of individual vessels
were outlined using NIS-Elements, BR 3.07 software
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). A Nikon 80i microscope (Nikon)
was used for imaging.
ELISA
A commercially available human VEGFa enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
US) was applied for protein analysis of in vitro samples
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorb￾ance was measured with a FLUOstar OPTIMA micro￾plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany)
and the values were compared to a known standard
curve.
Statistical analysis
For all statistical tests, P <0.05 was defined as a signifi￾cant difference. The independent samples t-test was ap￾plied for two-group comparisons, whereas a multiple
comparison one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
applied to output parameters that included three experi￾mental groups. The Brown-Forsythe test was performed
for equality of variances with no significant differences
between the groups. To quantify vessels, five images
were obtained systematically at 20x magnification for
each scaffold (N = 3 for each group). For real time RT￾PCR data a comparative Ct method with GAPDH as en￾dogenous control was used, with statistical differences
calculated between mean RQ-values for each experimen￾tal group. Data are presented as mean ± standard devi￾ation (N = 3). Statistical analysis was performed with
SPSS Statistics 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, US) and Graph￾Pad Prism Version 6.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, US).
Results
Mesenchymal stem cells induce endothelial cell
quiescence
The expression of endothelial specific ANGs was altered
by the addition of MSCs to the culture system (Figure 1A).
An up-regulation of ANG-1 was observed in co-cultured
cells when compared with controls of mono-cultured ECs.
The opposite regulation of ANG-2 was found, with a 12-
fold decrease in expression for constructs comprising both
ECs and MSCs (P <0.01). Cell proliferation was assessed
through expression of PCNA and ki67, both being down￾regulated in EC/MSC constructs relative to the mono￾cultured ECs (Figure 1B).
In a two-dimensional culture system where cells could
be separated, a cell count was performed to assess the
number of viable ECs in the two experimental groups
over a period of nine days (Figure 1C). A reduced num￾ber of ECs was found after seven days, but this was not
statistically significant (P = 0.07). After nine days co￾culture the number of viable ECs was significantly re￾duced in the presence of MSCs. Mono-cultured ECs
showed a typical cobblestone-like morphology after one
week of two-dimensional culture in vitro, and with the
addition of MSCs a less proliferative phenotype could
be observed (Figure 1D). ECs did not organize into

microvascular networks in the presence of MSCs at this
ratio (5:1 EC/MSC).
Expression of vascular and perivascular biomarkers
before and after implantation
FGF-1 and PDGFb are factors involved in angiogenic
sprouting and the recruitment of pericytes to developing
blood vessels. Both showed higher expression in the
mono-culture group at implantation and one week post￾implantation (Figure 2A). In order to determine the in￾fluence of MSCs on EC quiescence, the expression of
CD31 and vWF was analyzed (Figure 2B). In EC/MSC
constructs, a down-regulation of both markers was found
after one week of culture in vitro, as well as one week after
in vivo implantation.
Perivascular gene expression was evaluated through ex￾pression of α-SMA and SM22α, and increased expression
of both markers was detected for EC/MSC constructs
Figure 1 Mesenchymal stem cells induce endothelial cell quiescence. (A) The relative gene expression of ANG-1 and ANG-2 from
mono- and co-cultured constructs after one week dynamic culture in vitro was altered by co-seeding endothelial cells (ECs) with mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC). An up-regulation of ANG-1 and a down-regulation of ANG-2 was detected. (B) Also, cell proliferation markers PCNA and ki67
were both down-regulated in EC/MSC-constructs. (C) In a two-dimensional co-culture system, which allowed separation of cells, the number of
viable ECs was reduced in the presence of MSCs after five days culture. After seven days the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07),
whereas after nine days the number of viable ECs was significantly reduced in the presence of MSCs. (D) UEA-1 staining (red) demonstrated a

(Figure 3A). Evaluation of mouse specific vascular genes
showed an up-regulated expression of α-SMA in mono￾cultured ECs one week after implantation, whereas ex￾pression levels of VEGFa, ANG-1 and ANG-2 were not
significantly different between the experimental groups
(Figure 3B, upper). Three weeks after implantation, no dif￾ferences were observed for the vascular target genes evalu￾ated (Figure 3B, lower).
Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor from
human cells
Baseline mRNA (Figure 4A) and protein (Figure 4B) ex￾pression of VEGFa was evaluated for mono-cultured ECs
and MSCs, and it was found that MSCs expressed signifi￾cantly more VEGFa than ECs. Expression of VEGFa was
evaluated at three time points: one week in vitro culture
before implantation and one and three weeks after im￾plantation in vivo (Figure 4C). For cell/scaffold constructs
cultured in vitro, the expression of VEGFa was up￾regulated in the co-culture system, and this was main￾tained one week post-implantation. Three weeks after
implantation no significant differences were observed.
Influence of implanted cells on inflammation and
establishment of the mouse vasculature
The expression of human specific CSF-1 was higher in
mono-culture one week post-implantation, although
not statistically significant (P = 0.079). After three weeks
this tendency could no longer be found (Figure 5A).
CD11b + cells were found in close proximity to cell/
scaffold constructs in both experimental groups three
weeks after implantation (Figure 5B).
The expression of mouse specific ANKRD1 was used as
a biomarker for activation of the mouse endothelium, and
results show up-regulated expression in mono-culture
compared to empty controls (Figure 5D). The difference
between the experimental groups was not statistically sig￾nificant. As regulation of vessel diameter is an important
step in vascular maturation, blood vessels <20 μm were
defined as mature microvessels, whereas vessels >50 μm
were defined as immature. The remaining blood vessels
were defined as transitional. A higher percentage of
vessels <20 μm and >50 μm were found for both constructs
where human cells were implanted (Figure 5E and F). The
percentage of mature vessels (<20 μm) was highest in the
Figure 2 Human specific expression of vascular biomarkers before and after implantation. (A) The relative gene expression of the human
specific vascular biomarkers fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and platelet derived growth factor-b (PDGFb) was down-regulated in co-culture at
implantation after one week of dynamic three-dimensional culture in vitro and one week after implantation in vivo. (B) The expression of human
specific endothelial cell markers CD31 and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) was also down-regulated in co-culture both before and one week
post-implantation. * = P <0.05, ** = P <0.01.

EC/MSC-constructs, and the highest density of immature
vessels (>50 μm) was detected in the EC group. Both cel￾lular constructs had a higher density of blood vessels and
area fraction of the total vasculature compared with the
empty controls (Figure 5G). The vessel area fraction, how￾ever, was not statistically significant. Functional blood ves￾sels were identified by the presence of erythrocytes in the
lumen, and vascularization was evaluated through immu￾nostaining for CD31 (Figure 5C).
Discussion
In the process of vascular assembly, nascent vessels
depend on interaction with perivascular cells to establish
an endothelial-perivascular complex regulating vessel
growth and maturation. Bioengineered tissues depend
on mature blood vessels in order to adequately meet
their metabolic demands, and perivascular cells are
needed to generate a functional microvasculature. The
present study shows how a quiescent phenotype of ECs
was induced, by adding a low percentage of MSCs to the
culture system. Biomarkers for vascular maturation and
angiogenesis were both regulated by MSCs. In addition,
MSCs were found to be a potent producer of VEGFa, an
essential growth factor in vascular development. At the
end of the experimental period, both cell/scaffold con￾structs induced a higher vascular density than controls,
with the highest density of mature vessels being gener￾ated in constructs comprising ECs and MSCs.
Expression of endothelial specific ANG-1 and ANG-2
was altered in the presence of MSCs, with an up￾regulation of ANG-1 and down-regulation of ANG-2.
Competitive binding to the Tie2 receptor for both li￾gands is well known, and ANG-1 mediates vascular mat￾uration by stabilizing ECs in the quiescent G0-phase,
maintaining interactions between ECs, pericytes and the
extracellular matrix [19,20]. ANG-2 is associated with
destabilized ECs characteristic for angiogenic sprouting,
thus having the opposite effect on the vascular endothe￾lium. Proliferation and differentiation of cells are two
processes that tend not to occur simultaneously. In
order for nascent vessels to mature into patent tubes
with controlled permeability, proliferation of ECs should
subside [21]. On the gene level, the expression of cell
proliferation biomarkers PCNA and ki67 was deter￾mined, with both genes being down-regulated after co￾seeding with MSCs. In addition, cell counting revealed
fewer viable cells in the presence of MSCs after one
week of culture. Our results suggest the presence of
MSCs to induce a quiescent phenotype of ECs, via de￾creased cell proliferation and angiopoietin-expression
characteristic of vascular maturation. A potential inter￾pretation error of results after three-dimensional co￾culture was to isolate the expression patterns from the
two cell types, as retrieval and separation of cells after
culture in this highly interconnected scaffold has proven
to be difficult. A combination of two- and three￾dimensional culture could, therefore, provide more

perivascular biomarkers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and SM22α were both up-regulated in co-culture before implantation. (B) There were no
differences in the expression of the angiogenic factors VEGFa, ANG-1 and ANG-2 using mouse specific assays at either time point in vivo.
Expression of mouse α-SMA was up-regulated one week post-implantation in the EC-group, the opposite regulation as was observed with the
human specific α-SMA assay. No differences were found for mouse α-SMA three weeks post-implantation. ** = P <0.01. ANG-1, angiopoietin-1;

information, as has been performed in comparable ex￾periments [22], in addition to analyzing factors differen￾tially expressed for the two cell types, such as ANGs,
CD31 and vWF (ECs), and pericyte markers (MSCs).
The recruitment of pericytes regulates the transition
from vascular morphogenesis to a stabilized vasculature
[7]. An increasing consensus regarding a perivascular ori￾gin for MSCs has emerged in stem cell biology [4], and the
expression of perivascular markers has also been found for
undifferentiated MSCs [23,24]. With up-regulated expres￾sion of both α-SMA and SM22α, one might suggest that
ECs have an inductive effect on perivascular differentiation
of MSCs. Certainly, biological factors involved in forma￾tion of an endothelial-perivascular complex were present
in the EC/MSC-group before in vivo implantation. A com￾parison with mono-cultured MSCs might have been of
further interest to strengthen this conclusion, although in￾duced mural-cell differentiation of MSCs has been shown
to be regulated by the gap junction Connexin-45, thus de￾pending on direct contact between the two cell types [25].
Regardless of a terminal smooth muscle fate, MSCs have
shown the ability to support development of endothelial
Figure 4 Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-a (VEGFa) from human cells. Baseline gene (A) and protein (B) expression of
VEGFa was significantly higher for MSCs compared with ECs grown in two-dimensional culture in vitro. (C) The relative gene expression of VEGFa
from co-cultured constructs was also higher one week after dynamic three-dimensional culture in vitro and one week after implantation in vivo.

microvascular networks in direct co-culture systems
[15,24,26,27]. Enhanced proliferation of ECs has been re￾ported following indirect co-culture [26,28], findings sup￾ported by the high expression of VEGFa detected from
MSCs in the present work, suggesting the vascular assem￾bly itself to be the event that induces the reduced endo￾thelial cell proliferation, rather than secreted factors.
Regeneration in tissue engineering is likely to be caused
by both differentiation of implanted cells and subsequent
production of extracellular matrix proteins, as well as
stimulation of surrounding tissues through the release of
paracrine factors. Implantation of labeled cells could pro￾vide valuable information in animal models, but this strat￾egy is difficult to apply in humans. The fate of MSCs
labeled with luciferase has been followed through bio￾luminescent imaging subcutaneously and in a spine fusion
model in rats [29]. Cells were shown to survive at least
two weeks in vivo, but with a decreasing bioluminescent
signal after one week. This has been supported in a similar
subcutaneous model, as applied in the present work,
where implanted MSCs did not survive more than three
weeks after implantation [30]. Without perivascular cells,
vascular maturation is impaired leading to an endothelium
prone to regression [10,11]. However, signaling to sur￾rounding tissues can still be substantial, and degenerating
cells can deliver strong paracrine signals triggering a par￾ticular biological response.
When investigating the effect of cell implantation on
the expression of angiogenic factors using mouse specific
assays, an increase in α-SMA was found for mono￾cultured ECs one week post-implantation. This was the
opposite regulation as found for α-SMA expressed by
implanted cells, which were higher with MSCs in the
construct. The possibility for a compensatory down￾regulation with implantation of perivascular MSCs could
be suggested. The ANKRD1-gene is associated with EC
Figure 5 Inflammation and vascularization of scaffolds after three weeks implantation. (A) Early expression of human specific macrophage
colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) one week after implantation was higher in mono-culture, although not statistically significant (P = 0.079). Three

positive on the surface of the implanted constructs three weeks after implantation for both experimental groups. (C) Functional blood vessels
were identified on H & E staining by the presence of erythrocytes in the lumen and through CD31-staining. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).

activation and was used as a predictor of mouse specific
endothelial activation. At the end of the three-week
experimental period the expression was higher for
mono-cultured ECs, which correlated with the largest
percentage of immature vessels (>50 μm) also being de￾tected in this group. Both findings support an increased
vascular maturation achieved through co-implantation
of ECs and MSCs. Endothelial cell density has been re￾ported as a determining factor for mRNA expression of
ANKRD1, with a high density of ECs associated with
down-regulated ANKRD1-expression [31]. We also re￾port here a higher area fraction of CD31+ cells in the
EC-group and lower expression of ANKRD1. The other
selected vascular factors evaluated from the animal tis￾sue were unchanged, and the pro-angiogenic effects ob￾served could therefore be attributed to the implanted
cells, rather than the surrounding tissues. Alternatively,
the inflammatory response generated by implantation of
human cells contributed to increased expression of
angiogenic factors and subsequent vascularization. Al￾though NOD/SCID-mice are unable to undergo VDJ￾recombination, we demonstrate the presence of CD11b +
cells adjacent to cell/scaffold constructs. Induction of a
CD11b + cell population preceding increased angiogenesis
has previously been shown in a xenograft tumor trans￾plantation model [32]. In the present work, recruitment of
CD11b + cells was similar for both experimental groups,
suggesting the xenograft model itself to be the primary
causative agent, rather than a particular cell type. MSCs
have been shown to possess immunomodulatory proper￾ties when transplanted in vivo [33], even suggesting MSCs
as a therapeutic agent for autoimmune disease [34]. A
minor down-regulation in the expression of CSF-1 was
noted for EC/MSC-constructs one week after implant￾ation, but a higher percentage of MSCs might have been
needed to make a substantial effect on the immunological
response. Overall, the expression of factors promoting
angiogenesis was higher for mono-cultured ECs, such as
pro-angiogenic and pericyte recruiting factors PDGFb and
FGF-1. This could be due to the induced quiescence in
the co-culture group with ECs in the resting G0-phase.
However, perhaps the most important factor in vascular
development, VEGFa, was significantly higher expressed
in MSCs compared with ECs, and subsequently in EC/
MSC-constructs. This is in accordance with previous
work, where the supernatant from cultured MSCs induced
sprouting of ECs [35]. At the end of the experimental
period, the vascular density was higher in the co-culture
group, which was not expected, due to the reduced activity
of ECs. It could be suggested that the importance of
VEGF, in fact, makes MSCs constitute a stronger trigger
for vascular ingrowth than ECs, itself encouraging for
tissue regeneration strategies with MSCs. The higher
percentage of mature vessels <20 μm suggests that
implantation of ECs with MSCs provides a favorable
microenvironment for vascular maturation in a tissue￾engineering context.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the presence of MSCs even in low num￾bers induced a quiescent phenotype of ECs, regulating
biomarkers for vascular maturation. Implantation of
cell/scaffold constructs induced a higher vascular dens￾ity than control scaffolds, whereas the highest density of
capillaries was achieved through co-seeding of ECs and
MSCs. Hence, MSCs can be appropriate perivascular
cells for tissue-engineered constructs.
