BACKGROUND: To determine a very early predictive biomarker after hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) for the prediction of native
liver survival in biliary atresia (BA) patients.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of BA patients in our hospital between August 2000 and April 2019. The
serum total bilirubin (T-bil), direct bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase level 1 week after HPE were analyzed. The clinical
outcome predictors were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 90 BA patients were recruited. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a post-HPE 1-week
T-bil level ≤4.85 mg/dL predicted jaundice-free after HPE (P = 0.02). BA patients with a post-HPE 1-week T-bil ≤4.85 mg/dL were
more likely to be jaundice-free within 3 months of HPE (odds ratio = 3.53; P = 0.006). Kaplan–Meier plot analysis showed that the
likelihood of native liver survival and jaundice-free native liver survival were significantly higher in BA subjects with a post-HPE 1-
week T-bil ≤4.85 mg/dL than in other subjects (P = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The serum post-HPE 1-week T-bil level may predict the long-term outcome in BA patients. A post-HPE 1-week T-bil
≤4.85 mg/dL correlated with better native liver survival and jaundice-free native liver survival in BA patients.

INTRODUCTION
Biliary atresia (BA) is the leading cause of pediatric liver
transplantation.1 However, it is a relatively rare disorder,
occurring in 1 in 5000–20,000 live births.2–7 Hepatoportoenter￾ostomy (HPE), aimed at restoring biliary drainage to the
intestine, is the standard surgical intervention for BA and has
been shown to improve survival with native liver.8 The under￾lying mechanisms of progressive obstructive cholangiopathy are
unclear in large, and the long-term prognosis remains difficult to
predict.
Several factors have been reported to determine the ultimate
success of HPE, including age at the time of HPE,9–11 presence of
cirrhosis,12 case load of the hospital,13 occurrence of postoperative
cholangitis,14,15 and a decrease in serum bilirubin in the first few
months after HPE.16–24 Among all variables, serum bilirubin after
HPE appears to be the most predictive biomarker of clinical out￾comes.21 The timing of the evaluation of the total bilirubin (T-bil)
level has ranged from 7 days to 6 months in previous
publications,16–19,21,23 while the serum T-bil level at 3 months
after HPE is regarded as the most important outcome
predictor.20,21,25
Earlier prediction of outcome after HPE may assist the family
and physician in arranging a long-term treatment plan, such as
liver transplantation. Nevertheless, a 3-month wait places a huge
emotional burden on the parents, who would like to know as soon
as possible whether their baby could survive with native liver.
Besides, unfavorable outcome prediction allows the family to
prepare for further liver transplantation earlier. This study aimed
to investigate earlier clinical predictors of native liver survival in BA
patients.
METHODS
Subjects and clinical data
BA patient who underwent HPE at the National Taiwan University
Hospital between August 2000 and April 2019, with complete
clinical data 1 week after HPE, were recruited consecutively to this
retrospective study. The inclusion criteria are the BA patients who
received HPE at our hospital, with available laboratory data 1 week
after the surgery. The exclusion criteria are receiving HPE at other
hospitals or no available laboratory data 1 week after the surgery.
The diagnosis of BA was confirmed by intra-operative cholangio￾graphy in all study subjects. The medical charts of these patients
were reviewed retrospectively. A serum T-bil level <2 mg/dL was
defined as jaundice-free in this analysis.
Data on age at HPE, gender, types of BA, other associated
comorbidities, serum levels of T-bil, direct bilirubin (D-bil), gamma￾glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bile acid measured 1 week after
HPE, and the use of ancillary medical treatment including
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and steroids were collected for
analysis. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital.
Statistical analysis
The STATA (ver. 14.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and
MedCalc (ver. 18.6; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) software
were used for statistical analyses. The primary outcome was
jaundice-free survival after HPE, and the secondary outcome was
native liver survival. Overall native liver survival was defined as the
period from the date of birth until liver transplantation, death, or
the end of this study, whichever occurred first, while jaundice-free
native liver survival was defined as the period from the date of

becoming jaundice-free after HPE until the recurrence of jaundice,
liver transplantation, death, or the end of the analysis.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were
performed to determine cutoff values and area under curve. The
positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) of
each cutoff value were calculated. Logistic regression was used to
assess the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
predicting jaundice-free within 3 months of HPE. Cox’s propor￾tional hazard analysis, Kaplan–Meier plot, and log-rank test were
applied to the survival analysis for the prediction of native and
jaundice-free native liver survival in this study. A P value < 0.05
was regarded as statistically significant.
RESULTS
General characteristics
A total of 91 children underwent HPE at the National Taiwan
University Hospital between August 2000 and April 2019 (Fig. 1).
One of them was excluded owing to incomplete laboratory data
1 week after HPE. The other 90 children (38 males and 52 females)
were included in this retrospective analysis. The median patient
age at HPE was 50 days of age in this cohort. Sixty-eight children
(75.55%) achieved jaundice-free after a median time of
37.5 days after HPE, while the other 22 children had persistent
jaundice after HPE. There are 39 subjects (43.33%) who received
liver transplant after a median time of 11 months. The median
overall follow-up time, including post-liver transplantation follow￾up, was 62.5 months. The numbers and general characteristics of
the study population are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1.
Cutoff for the prediction of jaundice-free survival after HPE
ROC analyses were performed to determine the best cutoffs for
predicting jaundice-free at 1 week after HPE. The serum T-bil level
≤4.85 mg/dL at 1 week after HPE significantly predicted jaundice￾free after HPE in BA subjects (P = 0.02) (Fig. 2). The D-bil cutoff
≤3.30 mg/dL demonstrated a borderline significance in predicting
jaundice-free after HPE in BA subjects (P = 0.06). The GGT level
failed to achieve statistical significance in ROC analysis (P = 0.40).
Therefore, we applied the post-HPE 1-week T-bil level ≤4.85 mg/dL
as the marker in our statistic model.
A serum post-HPE 1-week T-bil level ≤4.85 mg/dL was also
predictive of jaundice-free within 3 months of HPE in univariate
logistic regression analyses after application of the Bonferroni
correction (OR = 3.53, P = 0.006; Table 2). In the multivariate
logistic regression model that included an age at HPE ≤60 days
and a post-HPE 1-week T-bil ≤4.85 mg/dL, only the post-HPE 1-
week T-bil ≤4.85 mg/dL reached statistical significance (OR = 3.73,
P = 0.006) while the HPE age did not (OR = 2.48, P = 0.07; Table 2).

>4.85 mg/dL are summarized in Table 3. The prevalence of liver
transplant is higher in subjects with post-HPE 1-week T-bil level
>4.85 mg/dL than in others ≤4.85 mg/dL (53.85% vs. 28.95%, P =
0.019).
Predictors of native liver survival
Cox’s proportional hazard analysis showed that serum T-bil ≤4.85
mg/dL at 1 week after HPE was predictive of a higher chance of
native liver survival (hazard ratio = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.17–4.64, P =
0.02). Kaplan–Meier plot analysis with log-rank test (Fig. 3a) further
demonstrated that the possibility of native liver survival was
significantly higher in BA subjects with a post-HPE 1-week T-bil
level ≤4.85 mg/dL vs. those with a T-bil level >4.85 mg/dL (log￾rank test, P = 0.01). The possibility of jaundice-free native liver
survival was also higher in BA subjects with a post-HPE 1-week T￾bil level ≤4.85 mg/dL vs. those with a T-bil level >4.85 mg/dL
(Fig. 3b, log-rank test, P = 0.01).
All of the BA subjects received HPE from four well-experienced
pediatric surgeons in our hospital. Neither native liver survival (P
= 0.15) nor jaundice-free native liver survival (P = 0.11) had
significant difference between different surgeons. In this cohort,
66 BA children (73.33%) received steroid therapy, and all 90 BA
children received UDCA and prophylactic antibiotics after HPE.
However, the combination of UDCA and steroid failed to predict
jaundice-free (P = 0.63), jaundice-free within 3 months (P = 0.25),
liver transplantation (P = 0.44), native liver survival (P = 0.37), or
jaundice-free native liver survival (P = 0.19) in our cohort.
DISCUSSION
BA remains the leading cause of liver transplantation in children in
the world.1 The severity of liver fibrosis progresses in the majority
of BA patients even after HPE.12 Early predictors of prognosis after
HPE for BA may allow risk stratification, precise planning and
monitoring of potential complications related to progressive liver
disease, implementation of intensified nutritional support, and
early preparation for liver transplantation, especially for area
shortage of cadaveric liver donor, such as Taiwan.
Prior investigations have delved into the role of different
laboratory data in prediction of the outcome after HPE.16–19,23,26–30
We summarized these articles in Table 4. Among them, discussions
regarding a T-bil level <2 mg/dL within 3 months after HPE as a
good short-term outcome predictor has dominated research in
recent years.22,26–29 In a prospective multicenter cohort study,
Shneider et al. found a 2-year native liver survival of 86% among
patients with a T-bil <2 mg/dL within 3 months after HPE, while the
2-year survival rate without transplantation was only 20% in those
with a T-bil ≥2 mg/dL at 3 months post-HPE.21 On the other hand,
Chusilp et al. proposed a >20% decrease in serum T-bil at seventh
day post-HPE, the earliest timing in the literature, to predict
jaundice-free within 6 months and 5-year survival with native
liver.16 Our previous studies demonstrated the serum matrix
metallopeptide 7 (MMP-7) levels and the liver stiffness measure￾ment assessed after HPE is predictive of the risk of liver
transplantation in BA, but the assessment of MMP-7 level and
liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography are not

routine test to date.12,30 In this study, we featured that the T-bil
level alone at 1 week after HPE was a very early predictor of long￾term native liver survival in BA patients. The rapid improvement of
the T-bil level after HPE indicated satisfactory bile flow and
prevented rapid progression of biliary cirrhosis by eliminating
cholestasis and peri-portal inflammation.13,31–33 A cutoff serum T￾bil level of ≤4.85 mg/dL at 1 week after HPE was a good predictor
of jaundice-free within 3 months, native liver survival, and
jaundice-free native liver survival in this BA cohort.
The use of ancillary medical treatments, such as prophylactic
antibiotics, UDCA, or steroids, to improve the outcome of HPE
remains in debate.28,29,31–34 A recent meta-analysis done by Qiu
et al. presented that combined UDCA and steroid intervention was
superior in accelerating the clearance of serum bilirubin in BA
patients after HPE.34 Since all BA subjects in this study cohort
received UDCA and prophylactic antibiotics after HPE, we are not
able to compare the difference in clinical outcomes between
subjects with and without UDCA and/or prophylactic antibiotics
after HPE. The use of steroids after HPE failed to predict jaundice￾free, jaundice-free within 3 months, liver transplantation, native
liver survival, or jaundice-free native liver survival in our cohort. A
large-scale clinical trial demonstrated that steroid therapy follow￾ing HPE did not result in statistically significant treatment
differences in bile drainage at 6 months in BA infants is also
supporting our observation.29
A major limitation of this framework is the unsatisfactory NPV,
which may result from the nature of retrospective designed and
relatively small sample size. Since BA is a rare disease in Taiwan, it is
difficult to have a very large sample in a single center.5 Our current
study has proven that the serum T-bil ≤4.85 mg/dL 1 week after
HPE is already predictable of clinical outcomes after HPE in BA
children. Further larger cohort may be needed in the future to
elucidate which marker is better in the outcome prediction. In
addition, we did not assess the size of small ductules communicat￾ing with the bile ducts of these surgical specimens in this study,35
because some pathology specimens were unable to be retrieved.
In conclusion, we report that a T-bil level ≤4.85 mg/dL at 1 week
after HPE, a very early timing, was correlated with jaundice-free at
3 months after HPE and also with long-term native and jaundice￾free native liver survival in BA children.
