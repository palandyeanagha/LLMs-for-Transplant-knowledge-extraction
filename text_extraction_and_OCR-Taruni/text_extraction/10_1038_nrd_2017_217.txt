Drug discovery and development is a highly 
challenging process (Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 9, 
203–214; 2010)1
. Its common characteriza￾tion as a ‘pipeline’ connotes consistent uni￾directional flow of a candidate therapeutic 
in unchanged form from basic research dis￾covery to drug to utilization, in stark contrast 
to the diverse web of failure-prone iterative 
learning loops that, in reality, must be tra￾versed by scientists, physicians, regulators, 
payers and patients to develop and use new 
treatments2
. This deeply engrained misnomer 
contributes to the lack of public understand￾ing of the drug development process, with 
implications for science and public policy, and 
leads to actions that may fail to improve, 
and perhaps even worsen, the process.
The Forum on Drug Discovery, Develop￾ment, and Translation of the US National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine is a platform for dialogue and col￾laboration among thought leaders in gov￾ernment, academia, industry, foundations, 
and disease and patient advocacy focused 
on improving the system of therapeutic dis￾covery. Here, we report the output of a year￾long effort by an ‘Action Collaborative’ of 
this forum, augmented by a diverse group 
of additional experts (see Acknowledgements), 
to conceptualize, create and annotate an 
accurate and customizable ‘Drug Discovery, 
Development and Deployment Map’ (4DM) 
of the process (FIG. 1). 
Beyond the chevron
The ‘chevron’ conceptualization of drug devel￾opment is a common, schematic representa￾tion of the pipeline concept. Previous efforts 
to more accurately portray the drug develop￾ment process, including the excellent ‘NETS’ 
map of Baxter et al.2
, took major steps to zoom 
in on each step of the chevron and display a 
network of interacting activity domains. In 
the 4DM, this concept is extended, convert￾ing the components of the traditional chevron 
diagram into ‘neighbourhoods’ of activities. 
For example, the clinical research and devel￾opment neighbourhood of the 4DM (FIG. 1e) 
corresponds to the clinical development 
segment of the chevron. However, each 
neighbourhood highlights the myriad of 
routes and steps involved, as well as how 
these activities interact with those in other 
neighbourhoods — for example, deposition 
of biospecimens from clinical studies (FIG. 1e)
into biorepositories to be utilized for target 
identification (FIG. 1a) — which are not dis￾cernible in the stepwise linear representation 
of the chevron diagram. 
Aspects of therapeutic development shown 
in the 4DM that are missing entirely from the 
chevron include: a neighbourhood for bio￾marker development (FIG. 1b), which takes place 
over multiple stages of the development process; 
inclusion of natural history studies, epidemiol￾ogy and patient input in the clinical research 
and development neighbourhood (FIG. 1e);
a post-marketing neighbourhood (FIG. 1g) that 
includes observations on safety, usage pat￾terns and effectiveness; and a medical land￾scape neighbourhood (FIG. 1h) covering the 
increasingly important issues of access and 
reimbursement. 
Within neighbourhoods, a distinction is 
made between steps that can be performed in 
parallel and those that must be performed 
in series. The failure to progress, which is 
so common in therapeutic development, 
is reflected in reiterative loops to indicate 
that many ‘shots on goal’ are often required 
before success is achieved at any step. We also 
attempted to indicate that discoveries at one 
step of the process may render earlier results 
irrelevant or unreliable, or even create new 
routes that provide shortcuts to later stages. 
Finally, since the development processes for 
small molecules and biologics differ in sub￾stantial ways, distinct versions of the 4DM were 
created, using monoclonal antibodies as the 
representative biologic3
. The major differences 
between these versions are in neighbourhoods 
c and d, which cover therapeutic candidate 
identification and optimization, respectively.
Evolution and application of the 4DM
For centuries, maps were static, paper-based 
and non-interactive. The last decade has seen 
the transformation of maps into dynamic, 
multi-parameter, customizable electronic 
tools with features that include varying mag￾nification and indications of limitations to 
efficient navigation that other travellers have 
reported. We have begun to incorporate 
these features into the 4DM and others will 
be refined in future versions. The current 
version of the 4DM can be viewed with or 
without ‘traffic’ indicated. To develop the lat￾ter, the authors, other members of the forum 
and a group of experts invited to participate 
(see Acknowledgements) voted on what 
steps they and their organizations had found 
severely or moderately onerous (red, pink or 
orange outlined boxes in FIG. 1, respectively; 
see also Supplementary information S1 (fig￾ure)) in terms of the time required, resources 
or failure rate. 
The steps outlined in red — selection of 
therapeutic targets, biomarker qualification, 
recruitment of clinical trial participants and 
incorporation of the patient perspective into 
the therapeutic development process — will 
be familiar to those well versed in the drug 
development process as being refractory 
to generally successful approaches, despite 
enormous investment of time, effort, and 
resources. Some of the steps indicated as being 
problematic but less so (outlined in orange) 
include commonly appreciated roadblocks 
(for example, identification of biomarkers), 
but others may be less familiar (for example, 
the time required for contractual and legal 
agreements, which is growing in importance 
given the increasingly multi-party nature of 
drug development projects). 
The 4DM will be of value to a wide variety 
of stakeholders. First, for scientists, patient 
advocates, policymakers or members of the 
public who are new to drug development, 
the 4DM will provide orientation to the reali￾ties of the process. For educators, it will pro￾vide a freely available teaching tool. For those 
embarking on a drug development project, it 
will help to locate the state of the project, 
identify next steps and anticipate downstream 
challenges. For those working to improve the 
process via translational science projects, 
the 4DM will indicate bottlenecks in need 
of innovation to expedite the process of new 
medicine discovery. 
Already, use of the map by stakeholders 
convened under the auspices of the forum 
has focused attention on how bottlenecks 
and blockages both hinder therapeutic devel￾opment as a whole and how they are unique 
to different sectors. This type of connection 
can drive understanding and promote dia￾logue in more thoughtful and unanticipated 
areas. However, the map itself will need to 
be updated by all stakeholders involved in

communicating, navigating and 
improving therapeutic development

therapeutic development so that a shared 
vocabulary evolves that will facilitate problem 
solving and promote innovation.
The process of creating the 4DM raised as 
many questions as it answered. This reflects 
the diversity of viewpoints and largely anec￾dotal nature underlying our understanding 
of the fundamental roadblocks to improved 
therapeutic development. It also became clear 
that there is a wide range of preference with 
regard to the simplicity–complexity contin￾uum, with some users preferring a simpler 
and more streamlined map and others a more 
dynamic and complex one. Thus, we present 
the 4DM as the start, not the completion, of 
what should be an increasingly broad, crowd￾sourced effort to understand and improve the 
therapeutic development process. 
The map enables a dialogue among stake￾holders for discussion of where bottlenecks 
exist for innovation and offers the poten￾tial for collaborative action to expedite the 
overall process of new medicine discovery. 
Clearly, the map could be refined by mak￾ing it more dynamic, allowing more or less 
detail depending on the question of interest 
and by incorporating other critical variables 
such as time and cost. We fully expect that the 
map will be refined to include other perspec￾tives and new features. A version of the map

Sciences website, in order to allow anyone to

for their use. 
We live in an era of enormous promise for 
therapeutic development and unprecedented 
demand for new therapies, combined with 
the entry of many new participants in the 
process. While this is cause for celebration, a 
common understanding and language of the 
topography of therapeutic development and 
its difficulties is essential to prevent unreal￾istic expectations and focus our collective 
energy on system-wide improvements that 
will benefit all. Toward this goal, we welcome 
input on how to make the map more accurate, 
comprehensive and useful to all stakeholders.
