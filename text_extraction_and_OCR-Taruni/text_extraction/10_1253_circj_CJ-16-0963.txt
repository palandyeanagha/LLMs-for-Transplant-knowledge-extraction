The aim of this study was therefore to assess the long￾term survival and transplant-related adverse events in 3 
recipient groups: (1) non-diabetic recipients; (2) those with 
pre-existing DM; and (3) those with new-onset DM to 
evaluate the clinical impact of new-onset DM after heart 
transplantation.
Methods
Patients
Between November 1992 and December 2013, a total of 
391 consecutive patients aged ≥17 years underwent isolated 
orthotopic heart transplantation at the present institution, 
and the recipient demographic and clinical data were 
prospectively registered in the cardiac surgery database. Of 
these, 46 patients were diagnosed with DM preoperatively 
(pre-existing DM group), whereas 88 were newly diagnosed 
with DM after heart transplantation (new-onset DM 
group). These 2 diabetic groups were compared with the 
remaining non-diabetic patients (no-diabetes group, n=257).
The diagnosis of new-onset DM was made according to 
the criteria suggested by the American Diabetes Asso￾ciation:9 fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dL, and oral 
Heart transplantation has gained acceptance world￾wide as a useful therapeutic option for the treat￾ment of end-stage heart failure.1 Along with 
growing knowledge of immunosuppression therapy and 
evolving surgical techniques, the long-term survival rate 
has noticeably improved over the last several decades.1
Accordingly, the clinical application of heart transplanta￾tion has extended to high-risk recipients with comorbidities 
such as diabetes mellitus (DM).2,3 Concurrently, a growing 
number of cases of heart failure have been attributed to 
DM for the last several decades, and the proportion of 
diabetic candidates enrolled for heart transplantation is 
increasing.1,4
Aside from pre-existing DM, DM may also occur as a 
complication after heart transplantation, and this new￾onset DM may further predispose the recipients to greater 
risk for overall mortality or other transplant-related adverse 
events.5 There are only a few studies, however, that provide 
comparative long-term data on clinical outcomes of heart 
transplant with new-onset DM; in addition, previous studies 
have yielded mixed results regarding such long-term clinical 
outcomes in these diabetic recipients diagnosed pre- and 
postoperatively.2,3,6–8

Background: New-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) can occur as a serious complication after heart transplantation, but the comparative 
data on its clinical impact on survival and on transplant-related adverse events are limited.
Methods and Results: We reviewed a total of consecutive 391 patients aged ≥17 years undergoing isolated orthotopic heart trans￾plantation at the present institution from 1992 to 2013. The entire cohort was divided into 3 groups: (1) no diabetes (n=257); (2) 
pre-existing DM (n=46); and (3) new-onset DM (n=88). Early and long-term clinical outcomes were compared across the 3 groups. 
Early death occurred in 8 patients (2.0%). Of the 345 non-diabetic patients before transplantation, 88 (25.5%) developed new-onset 
DM postoperatively. During follow-up, 83 (21.2%) died. On time-varying Cox analysis, new-onset DM was associated with increased 
risk for overall death (HR, 2.11; 95% CI: 1.26–3.55) and tended to have a greater risk for severe chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.77; 
95% CI: 0.94–3.44). Compared with the no-diabetes group, the new-onset DM group had a worse survival rate (P=0.035), but a 
similar survival rate to that of the pre-existing DM group (P=0.364).
Conclusions: New-onset DM has a negative effect on long-term survival and kidney function after heart transplantation. Further 
studies are warranted to evaluate the relevance of early diagnosis and timely control of new-onset DM to improve long-term survival.

Clinical Impact of New-Onset DM 807
because it is a more robust and unbiased index.11 The 
secondary outcomes of interest were transplant-related 
adverse events including cerebrovascular accident (CVA), 
cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), moderate-severe 
rejection, severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cyto￾megalovirus (CMV) infection. The other outcomes of 
interest were the composite of the primary and secondary 
outcomes including CAV-free survival, severe CKD-free 
survival, and moderate-severe rejection-free survival.
The diagnosis of CAV was made on retrospective review 
of all coronary angiography (CAG) performed in every 
patient 1 year after transplantation and every 2 years there￾after by protocol. CAV was deemed to be present if post￾operative CAG showed one of the following abnormalities: 
(1) discrete lesions >50% of the primary vessels; or (2) 
diffuse or concentric narrowing of any vessels.12
The diagnosis of cellular rejection was made on endo￾myocardial biopsy, and the results were classified according 
to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplan￾tation (ISHLT) grading system;13 moderate-severe rejection 
was defined as biopsy result consistent with >2R. Endomyo￾cardial biopsy was performed in every patient: weekly for 
the first month after transplantation, monthly for the next 
3 months, and every 6–12 months thereafter by protocol.
CKD was considered to be severe for estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) <30mL/min/1.73m2 or requirement 
for dialysis for 3 consecutive months after transplantation 
according to the classification of the National Kidney 
Foundation.14 CMV infection was defined as positive CMV 
antigenemia assay regardless of the presenting symptoms.15
CMV antigenemia assay was performed in every patient 
weekly for the first month after transplantation, then at 
every outpatient clinic visit after discharge during the next 
11 months.
Follow-up was performed at the outpatient clinic, and 
the follow-up interval was determined according to need 
for adjustment of immunosuppressive regimen and hemo￾dynamic status on a case-by-case basis.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables are expressed as percentages or 
frequencies, and continuous variables are presented as 
mean±SD or median (inter-quartile range [IQR]). Differ￾ence in baseline characteristics between the groups was 
compared using Student’s t-test or analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for continuous variables, and chi-squared test 
for categorical variables.
To analyze the time interval between heart transplanta￾tion and the development of new-onset DM, time-varying 
Cox proportional hazards models were used: new-onset 
DM was regarded as a time-dependent variable in the 
evaluation of impact on mortality and other transplant￾related events. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed to 
evaluate the simultaneous influence of other baseline 
variables (Table 1). Variables with P≤0.2 on univariate Cox 
analysis were incorporated into the multivariate Cox models. 
Multivariate Cox analysis used a backward elimination 
technique. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis were 
performed to delineate actuarial survival as well as CAV￾free, severe CKD-free, and rejection-free survival. Log￾rank tests were used to assess inter-group differences in 
survival. Also, landmark survival analysis was performed 
to separately analyze the early and late mortality outcomes 
across the 3 groups.16
All reported P values are 2-sided, and the conventional 
hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin therapy initiated post￾operatively. Oral glucose tolerance test or glycated hemo￾globin level were obtained as necessary to confirm the 
diagnosis of new-onset DM.8 Recipients were excluded if 
they had episodes of transient hyperglycemia (1) during 
immediate postoperative period (within 7 days); (2) during 
high-dose steroid therapy due to acute rejection; or (3) 
due to other causative factors such as i.v. nutritional support 
or sepsis.
Clinical data were retrieved from the institutional cardiac 
surgery database, and supplemented by reviewing individual 
patient medical records. This study was approved by the 
institutional ethics committee/review board with the require￾ment for informed consent waived due to the retrospective 
nature of the study.
Organ Procurement and Surgical Technique
All allograft hearts were harvested from brain-dead, heart￾beating donors. Heart procurement and preservation were 
performed with cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate 
solution (Custodiol HTK; Essential Pharmaceuticals, 
Newtown, PA, USA), injected through the aortic root and 
topical cooling with slushed ice.
The surgical techniques for anastomosis have been 
described in a previous study.10 In brief, before 1999, heart 
transplantation was performed via the standard biatrial 
technique (n=53), whereas all recipients have undergone 
heart transplantation using the bicaval technique (n=338) 
thereafter.
Immunosuppression Protocol
Before June 1999, the initial induction therapy consisted 
of cyclosporine 5mg/kg and azathioprine 4mg/kg (era 1, 
November 1992–May 1999).10 Since July 1999, interleukin-2 
monoclonal antibody (Basiliximab) was introduced in the 
induction therapy protocol, and mycophenolate mofetil 
(CellCept; Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ, USA) has 
mainly replaced azathioprine in both induction and main￾tenance therapy protocols. The maintenance therapy 
protocol generally consists of the triple-drug combination 
of calcineurin inhibitors (cylcosporine or tacrolimus), anti￾proliferative agents (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil), 
and corticosteroid. Cyclosporine was generally discontinued 
at serum creatinine >1.5mg/dL. Cyclosporine was the 
main calcineurin inhibitor until January 2007 (era 2, June 
1999–December 2006), when tacrolimus replaced cyclo￾sporine and became the main calcineurin inhibitor used at 
the present institution (era 3, January 2007–December 
2013). Corticosteroid (i.v. methylprednisolone 500mg) was 
first introduced intraoperatively immediately before release 
of the aortic cross-clamp.10 Postoperatively, i.v. methylpred￾nisolone was given at the initial dose of 1mg/kg/day. After 
the recipients were extubated and started on oral medica￾tions, i.v. methylprednisolone was switched to oral pred￾nisolone, which was gradually tapered down over 1 month 
to 0.20–0.25mg/kg/day; the recipients who developed 
hyperglycemia after transplantation were treated with s.c. 
insulin injection during this period with a goal of serum 
hemoglobin A1c <7.0. After tapering the dose of cortico￾steroid, the recipients were treated with oral hypoglycemic 
agents when blood glucose level was normalized.
Outcomes of Interest, Definitions and Follow-up
The primary outcome of interest was all-cause death, which 
was chosen over cardiac death as the primary outcome

Early Postoperative Outcomes
Early death occurred in 8 patients (3.1%) in the no-diabetes 
group, while there was no early death in the pre-existing 
or new-onset DM group. Apart from early death, there 
were no significant differences in the rate of early major 
morbidities including mechanical circulatory support 
P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. R version 
3.1.3 (http://www.r-project.org/), was used for statistical 
analysis.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the baseline patient characteristics. 
The non-diabetic recipients were younger than those in the 
pre-existing and new-onset DM group. There were signifi￾cant inter-group differences in the baseline characteristics 
including age (P<0.001), gender (P=0.028), and other 
morbidities including hypertension (HTN; P<0.001), high 
systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP, P<0.001) and 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation according to pressure 
gradient (P=0.001).
The anastomosis technique (P=0.264) according to 
surgical era was similar across the 3 groups. The total 
ischemic time for all recipients was 150.3±60.9min, and 
there was no significant difference in the total ischemic 
time across the 3 groups (148.8±62.0 vs. 143.5±54.6 vs. 
158.2±60.7min; P=0.287).
New-Onset DM
Of 345 non-diabetic patients before heart transplantation, 
88 (25.5%) were diagnosed with new-onset DM. During 
follow-up, the cumulative incidence of new-onset DM was 
17.1%, 21.2% and 22.7% at 2 months, 6 months and 1 year 
after transplantation, respectively with a median time to

influenced the increased risk of all-cause death (P=0.001) 
and tended to be associated with increased risk for severe 
CKD (P=0.078). On multivariate analysis, both pre-existing 
(HR, 2.46; 95% CI: 1.27–4.77; P=0.006) and new-onset 
DM (HR, 2.11; 95% CI: 1.26–3.55; P=0.005) were associ￾ated with increased risks of all-cause death.
Discussion
The key findings of this study are as follows: (1) non￾diabetic patients had superior survival/event-free survival 
rates and freedom from severe CKD after heart 
(P=0.909), early CVA (P=0.177), acute kidney injury 
requiring new dialysis (P=0.351), postoperative bleeding 
requiring re-exploration (P=0.278), or moderate-severe left 
ventricular primary graft dysfunction (PGD-LV; P=0.877; 
Table 2). The length of hospital (P=0.392) and intensive 
care unit stay (P=0.255) did not significantly vary across 
the 3 groups.
Long-Term Clinical Outcomes
Follow-up was complete in all recipients. During a median 
follow-up period of 5.4 years (IQR, 2.8–9.5 years), 78 
patients (19.9%) died or underwent re-transplantation 
(n=2), and 270 (69.1%) had transplant-related adverse 
events. A difference in the overall survival rate was 
observed between the diabetic and the non-diabetic groups 
(no-diabetes vs. pre-existing DM vs. new-onset DM, 16.7% 
vs. 26.1% vs. 26.1%; P=0.011). Regarding transplant-related 
adverse-events, event-free rates were similar between the 3 
groups except for severe CKD and CMV infection: CVA 
(P=0.114), CAV (P=0.559), moderate–severe rejection 
(P=0.705), severe CKD (P=0.027) and CMV infection 
(P=0.012).
On multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, 
male gender (P=0.039), pre-existing (P=0.006) and new￾onset DM (P=0.005) and serum total bilirubin (P<0.001) 
were significant risk factors for all-cause mortality (Table 3). 
New-onset DM was associated with an increased risk for 
cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.35; 95% CI: 1.20–4.62; 
P=0.013). On Kaplan-Meier analysis there was a significant 
difference in the rate of overall survival (P=0.011), CAV￾free survival (P=0.018), and severe CKD-free survival 
(P=0.002) favoring the non-diabetic patients over the 
either pre-existing or new-onset DM patients (Figure 2). In 
contrast, the 2 diabetic groups had no significant differences 
in the rate of overall survival (P=0.364), CAV-free survival 
(P=0.752), severe CKD-free survival (P=0.278) or moderate￾severe rejection-free survival (P=0.621). On landmark 
survival analysis, differences in overall survival and CAV￾free survival were mainly attributed to differences in the 
late post-transplant period (5-year landmark, P<0.001 for 
overall survival and P=0.001 for CAV-free survival), while 
there was no significant difference in the survival rate 
within the first 5 years across the 3 groups (P=0.709 for 
overall survival and P=0.496 for CAV-free survival; 
Figure 3A,B).
Risk of New-Onset DM
On multivariate logistic regression analysis, several inde￾pendent risk factors for new-onset DM were identified: 
advanced age (≥50 years; P=0.001), male gender (P=0.009), 
and high systolic PAP (>50mmHg; P=0.004). HTN (OR, 
2.14; 95% CI: 1.02–4.46; P=0.043) and ischemic cardiomy￾opathy (ICM; OR, 1.81; 95% CI: 0.95–3.45; P=0.070) were 
identified as significant risk factors for new-onset DM on 
univariate analysis, but were not included in the final stage 
of multivariate analysis (Table 4).
Effect of Pre-Existing and New-Onset DM on Long-Term 
Clinical Outcome
Table 5 lists the results of risk analysis of pre-existing- and 
new-onset DM affecting all-cause death and transplant￾related adverse events. On univariate time-varying Cox 
analysis, pre-existing DM was associated with increased 
risk of all-cause death (P=0.038), CVA (P=0.039) and 
severe CKD (P=0.025), whereas new-onset DM significantly

mortality after heart transplantation showed mixed results: 
Klingenberg et al reported on a series of 243 patients 
receiving heart transplantation and noted better long-term 
survival in the non-diabetic recipients (P=0.004) compared 
with the recipients with pre-existing DM.7 In contrast, 
Russo et al reported that the survival rates after heart 
transplantation were similar between the uncomplicated 
diabetic and the non-diabetic patients.2
Meanwhile, new-onset DM has not attracted as much 
clinical attention as pre-existing DM, and there are few 
studies on its impact on clinical outcomes after heart trans￾plantation.20 Klingenberg et al reported in the aforemen￾tioned study that the overall survival rate was similar 
between the non-diabetic (n=151) and new-onset DM 
patients (n=39; P=0.50),7 and Cho et al also reported that 
the mid-term survival rate was not significantly different 
(92.9±4.1% vs. 85.8±3.2%; P=0.22) between the non-diabetic 
(n=140) and new-onset DM patients (n=54).8 The present 
study involved a larger cohort of new-onset DM patients 
(n=88) during a longer follow-up period (median, 5.4 
transplantation compared with new-onset or pre-existing 
DM patients; (2) there was no significant difference in 
long-term overall or event-free survival rate between the 
new-onset DM and the pre-existing DM groups; and (3) 
advanced age (>50), male gender, and high systolic PAP 
were significant risk factors for new-onset DM.
Heart transplantation is the treatment of choice for end￾stage heart failure, and overall clinical outcomes such as 
post-transplant survival rate have improved in recent 
years.1 Along with these clinical advancements, the 
spectrum of transplant candidates has been widened to 
include more morbidities: the proportion of patients with 
pre-existing DM enrolled for heart transplantation is 
increasing.1,17 Uncontrolled DM, however, may predispose 
the transplant candidates to preoperative end-organ damage 
such as CKD or CVA, and increased mortality and 
morbidity after heart transplantation.2 For these reasons, 
pre-existing complicated DM is still considered a relative 
contraindication for heart transplantation,18,19 but previous 
studies on the impact of pre-existing DM on overall

Clinical Impact of New-Onset DM 813
heart transplantation (HR, 1.21; 95% CI: 0.55–2.68; 
P=0.636). In the management of high BP, we did not use 
renin-angiotensin system blockers (angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker) because 
these agents have the potential to induce hyperkalemia or 
reduction in GFR, thereby causing life-threatening hyper￾kalemia or nephrotoxicity in recipients taking calcineurin 
inhibitors.
Given the detrimental impacts of new-onset DM on 
survival and renal function, we performed a risk analysis 
in an attempt to identify the modifiable risk factors for 
new-onset DM: male gender (P=0.009), advanced age (≥50 
years; P=0.001) and high systolic PAP (>50 mmHg; 
P=0.004) emerged as significant predictors for new-onset 
DM on multivariate analysis. ICM was also associated 
with the development of new-onset DM on univariate 
analysis. These results are partly consistent with previous 
studies that identified old age and ICM as risk factors.8,23
In this study, we could not identify any modifiable risk 
factors, and the immunosuppressant choice did not affect 
the development of new-onset DM. Despite the reported 
higher incidence of new-onset DM in solid-organ trans￾plant recipients receiving tacrolimus,24 in the present study 
there was no difference in the incidence of new-onset DM 
between the era 2 (cyclosporine) and era 3 (tacrolimus) 
groups (28.6% vs. 27.2%; P=0.885). Likewise, immunosup￾pression treatment with steroid is a well-known risk factor 
for the development of new-onset DM after transplanta￾tion. Particularly, high-dose steroid use and the duration 
of therapy were clearly associated with the increased risk 
of new-onset DM. Under our steroid-use protocol, 88 
(25.5%) patients developed new-onset DM, which is com￾parable to the incidence of new-onset DM reported by 
ISHLT.1 Among 88 patients with new-onset DM, 63 
(71.6%) and 77 (87.5%) developed new-onset DM within 3 
months and 12 months after transplantation, respectively. 
During follow-up at the outpatient clinic, steroid could be 
tapered out in 323 patients (82.6%) at 1 year after heart 
transplantation.
Interestingly, we found that high systolic PAP was 
identified as a significant risk factor for new-onset DM. Of 
note, Hansmann et al noted in their animal model that 
insulin resistance may be a predisposing factor for pulmo￾nary HTN.25 From this we inferred that high systolic PAP 
in the present study may have acted as a surrogate marker 
for insulin resistance. But, clearly, this inference warrants 
further study. Although the identified risk factors for 
new-onset DM were not potentially modifiable, recipients 
with these risk factors may require close monitoring and 
timely control of new-onset DM to minimize the potential 
complications.
Study Limitations
This study was subject to the limitations inherent in retro￾spective analysis with single-center observational data. The 
present results could also have been affected by undetected 
confounders and detection bias. Also, the subjects belonged 
to a single Asian ethnic group except for 1 patient, who was 
Caucasian, therefore, these results may not be generalized 
to the non-Asian patients undergoing heart transplantation.
Conclusions
New-onset DM as well as pre-existing DM is associated 
with increased risk of overall death and may confer addi￾years; IQR, 2.8–9.5 years) and the new-onset DM as well 
as the pre-existing DM patients had worse survival 
outcomes compared with the non-diabetic patients. We 
speculate that new-onset DM may affect survival in a similar 
fashion to uncomplicated DM in the short term, but act in 
a complicated fashion as DM progresses, eventually resulting 
in worse survival in the long term;2,7 as shown on landmark 
survival analysis (Figure 3), the survival difference mainly 
stemmed from the late post-transplant period (5-year land￾mark, P<0.001). This appears to reflect the time interval in 
which DM progression worsens survival. We speculate 
that the use of landmark survival analysis is the unique 
strength of this study because many of the biases inherent 
in disease with variable onset such as new-onset DM could 
be adjusted for, using this analysis technique. The lower 
survival rate in the new-onset DM group may not be 
surprising given the higher age in the new-onset DM group 
compared with the no-diabetes group (49.3±9.8 vs. 42.0±13.5 
years; P<0.001). After adjusting for other risk factors 
including age, however, new-onset DM was still signifi￾cantly associated with the increased risk for all-cause death 
(HR 2.11; 95% CI: 1.26-3.55; P=0.005).
The detrimental influence of DM on the progression of 
kidney disease is well established, and this may be further 
corroborated by the present study, in which the no-diabetes 
group had the superior severe CKD-free rate compared 
with the pre-existing (P=0.020) and new-onset DM group 
(P=0.027). On univariate risk analysis, pre-existing DM 
was associated with increased risk of severe CKD (HR, 
2.69; 95% CI: 1.13–6.42; P=0.025), whereas new-onset DM 
strongly tended to affect the increased risk for severe CKD 
(HR, 1.77; 95% CI: 0.94–3.34; P=0.078). This indicates 
that the detrimental effects of new-onset DM may be less 
severe than those of pre-existing DM, presumably due to 
the shorter duration of DM. In contrast to severe CKD, 
the risk of developing CAV was significantly affected by 
neither pre-existing DM (P=0.780) nor new-onset DM 
(P=0.067) on univariate risk analysis, and there was no 
significant difference in the CAV-free rates across the 3 
groups (P=0.559). As suggested by Kato et al, glucose 
intolerance may contribute to the development of CAV,21
but other risk factors rather than DM may play a more 
important role in the development of CAV, such as lipid 
abnormalities or an underlying immunologic mechanism.22
In the present institution, we routinely start the recipients 
on statin therapy irrespective of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) level within 1 month after transplan￾tation. We adjust the dose of statin to maintain LDL-C 
<100mg/dL. In the present cohort, 286 recipients (73.1%) 
developed hyperlipidemia after heart transplant. On time￾varying Cox modeling, however, post-transplant hyper￾lipidemia was not associated with an increased risk for 
the progression of CAV (HR, 1.62; 95% CI: 0.84–3.10; 
P=0.147).
Other comorbidities, such as HTN, may have influenced 
the development of CKD or CAV after heart transplanta￾tion. In this study, pre-transplant HTN was associated 
with an increased risk for CKD (HR, 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09–
4.72; P=0.028). The causal relationship between high 
blood pressure (BP) and the development of CKD after 
heart transplantation, however, was difficult to investigate 
because all recipients with high BP after heart transplant 
were treated with anti-HTN medications to maintain 
systolic BP <140mmHg. In contrast, pre-transplant HTN 
was not a risk factor for the development of CAV after

tional risk for impaired kidney function in heart-transplant 
recipients. The long-term survival in the new-onset DM 
group was not significantly different from that in the pre￾existing DM group, and the survival difference between 
this and the no-diabetes group mainly stemmed from the 
late postoperative period. Further studies are warranted to 
investigate the relevance of early diagnosis and timely 
control of new-onset DM for improvement of long-term 
survival and reduction of transplant-related adverse events.
