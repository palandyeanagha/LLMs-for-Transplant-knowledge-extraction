Abstract
Introduction: The high incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria among patients admitted to ICUs has
determined an increase of tigecycline (TGC) use for the treatment of severe infections. Many concerns have been
raised about the efficacy of this molecule and increased dosages have been proposed. Our purpose is to investigate
TGC safety and efficacy at higher than standard doses.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of prospectively collected data in the ICU of a teaching hospital in
Rome. Data from all patients treated with TGC for a microbiologically confirmed infection were analyzed. The safety
profile and efficacy of high dosing regimen use were investigated.
Results: Over the study period, 54 patients (pts) received TGC at a standard dose (SD group: 50 mg every 12 hours)
and 46 at a high dose (HD group: 100 mg every 12 hours). Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter.baumannii
(blaOXA-58 and blaOXA-23 genes) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (blaKPC-3 gene) were the main isolated pathogens
(n = 79). There were no patients requiring TGC discontinuation or dose reduction because of adverse events. In
the ventilation-associated pneumonia population (VAP) subgroup (63 patients: 30 received SD and 33 HD), the only
independent predictor of clinical cure was the use of high tigecycline dose (odds ratio (OR) 6.25; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.59 to 24.57; P = 0.009) whilst initial inadequate antimicrobial treatment (IIAT) (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to
0.68; P = 0.01) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87; P = 0.003)
were independently associated with clinical failure.
Conclusions: TGC was well tolerated at a higher than standard dose in a cohort of critically ill patients with severe
infections. In the VAP subgroup the high-dose regimen was associated with better outcomes than conventional
administration due to Gram-negative MDR bacteria.
Introduction
Tigecycline (TGC) is the first glycylcycline of the tetracyc￾line antibiotic class approved in Europe for the treatment
of complicated skin and skin-structures infections (cSSI),
complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), at a dose of
50 mg twice daily after a 100 mg loading dose, [1].
In vitro this antibiotic has shown good antibacterial
activity against most of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in￾cluding multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria.
However Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and
Providencia spp. are intrinsically resistant [1].
A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alert
[2] announced an increased TGC-attributable mortality,
thus discouraging its adoption for severe nosocomial
infections. However, due to the scarcity of other effective
antimicrobials its use is frequently extended to the treat￾ment of colistin-resistant bacteria [3].
Because the area under the plasma concentration versus
time (AUC) to microorganism minimal inhibitory concen￾tration (MIC) ratio (AUC/MIC ratio) is the major deter￾minant of antimicrobial activity of TGC, some authors
have proposed increased daily dosages for treating severe
infections due to MDR bacteria [4]. Clinical experience

with doses >100 mg daily is very limited, but data reported
to date suggest that TGC may be useful and well-tolerated
at higher doses [5,6].
Thus we performed a retrospective analysis of prospect￾ively collected data from critically ill patients who received
TGC for microbiologically confirmed severe infections, to
investigate its efficacy and safety at higher than standard
doses.
Methods
Study site, subjects and design
The study was conducted in the 18-bed adult ICU of a
tertiary university teaching hospital admitting approxi￾mately 900 patients per year. This study was approved
by our Ethical Committee (Catholic University’s Ethics
Committee (approval number:14599/13)) that waived
the need for informed consent, due to its retrospective
design. All patients consecutively admitted to our ICU
between 1 June 2009 through 31 May 2012 who received
TGC for a microbiologically documented infection were
evaluated. TGC treatment should last at least three days
including the loading dose (LD). Data were extracted
from patients’ medical records and computerized hospital
databases according to a pre-defined questionnaire. These
data included demographic characteristics, medical his￾tory, clinical and laboratory findings, the simplified acute
physiology score II (SAPS II) and sequential organ failure
assessment (SOFA) score, the occurrence of abnormal
laboratory measures, type of treatment and outcome. The
main outcomes of patients were evaluated according to
TGC dosages they received, and type of infections, separ￾ately analyzing the subgroup of patients with ventilator￾associated pneumonia (VAP).
Definitions
Patients who were treated with TGC 50 mg every 12 hours
after a 100-mg LD were defined as the standard dose
group (SD). Those ones who received 100 mg every
12 hours after a 200 mg LD were classified as the high
dose group (HD).
The diagnosis of VAP was established when a new,
persistent, progressive radiographic lung infiltrate was
present ≥48 hours following tracheal intubation and
when two or more of the following clinical criteria were
met: (1) new onset of purulent bronchial secretions; (2)
body temperature >38.8°C or <35.5°C; and (3) white blood
cell count >10,000/mm3 or <4,000/mm3 [7]. All episodes
were microbiologically confirmed by quantitative cultures
of bronchoalveolar lavage (≥104 cfu/ml). The diagnosis of
IAI and cSSTIs and bloodstream infections (BSIs) were
made according to current guidelines [8-10].
Infection onset coincided with the collection date of
the first microbiological sample culture yielding the
study isolate (index culture). Septic shock was defined as
recommended by the American College of Chest Physi￾cians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Con￾ference Committee [11]. Safety and adverse events (AE)
were determined through the biochemical abnormalities
documented in medical records according to the Depart￾ment of Health and Human Services - Common Termin￾ology Criteria for Adverse Events (DHHS-CTCAE v.3.0)
classification [12]. The severity of AE was graded from 1
to 5 [12].
Clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of
all signs and symptoms of the infection by the end of
TGC therapy. Improvement or lack of progression of all
abnormalities on chest radiographs was also required for
VAP [13]. Microbiological eradication was defined as the
absence of the original pathogens from the culture of
the specimens subsequently collected from the original
site. Clinical outcomes were independently evaluated by
two physicians (GDP, VB) who were blinded to the treat￾ment. When judgments were discordant (about 5% of
patients), the reviewers reassessed the data and reached
a consensus decision.
The initial antimicrobial regimen (that is, that used
before in vitro susceptibility data were available for the
isolated bacteria) was classified as inadequate (IIAT)
when it did not include any agent displaying in vitro
activity against the isolated pathogen/pathogens.
Microbiology analysis
Strains were identified to the species level with the matrix￾assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI￾TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (BrukerDaltonik). The anti￾biotic susceptibility profiling of isolates had been performed
with the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile,
France). The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) criteria were used to interpret the results [14]. TGC
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were identified
with the Sensititre broth microdilution method (Trek Diag￾nostic Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA); isolates were consid￾ered susceptible if the MIC was ≤2 mg/L and resistant if
the MIC was ≥8 mg/L [15]. Multidrug-resistance was
defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent
in three or more antimicrobial categories, extensive drug￾resistance (XDR) was defined as non-susceptibility to at
least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial
categories and pandrug-resistance (PDR) was defined as
non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categor￾ies [16]. The presence of blagenes conferring resistance to
carbapenems was determined by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and sequencing, as previously described [17,18].
Statistical analysis
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to value the
variables distribution. The data with a non-normal distri￾bution were assessed with Mann–Whitney test and the

median and selected centiles (25th to 75th) value was
given. The data with a normal distribution were assessed
with the Student t-test. Categorical variables are presented
as proportions and were analyzed with the use of the chi￾square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. A P-value
<0.05 was considered significant. The crude odds ratio
(OR) and 95% CI were calculated for each variable. We
included all variables in the multivariable logistic regres￾sion if they achieved a P-value of less than or equal to 0.2
at the univariate analysis. A stepwise selection procedure
was used to select variables for inclusion in the final
model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
were used to assess the goodness of the logistic final
model. All statistical analyses were performed using the
Intercooled Stata program, version 11, for Windows (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Incidence and patient characteristics in the overall
population
During the study period, out of 2,120 patients admitted
to our ICU, 134 received TGC with an incidence of 63.2
treated patients per 1,000 ICU admissions. Only 100 pa￾tients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were considered
for the retrospective analysis: 63 (63%) were affected by
VAP and 37 by other infections: IAI (n = 23, 23%), pri￾mary BSI (n = 7, 7%) and cSSTI (n = 7, 7%).
Fifty-four patients received the SD of TGC and 46 the
HD. In the VAP subgroup 47.6% (30/63) received SD
and 52.4% (33/63) HD. The flowchart of the study is
shown in Figure 1. Ninety percent (n = 109) of the 121
causative organisms were Gram-negative, most often
Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 50) and Acinetobacter bau￾mannii (n = 34). Carbapenem resistance was detected in
all A. baumannii isolates, and in all but five (three VAP,
two cSSTI) K. pneumoniae isolates. PCR and sequencing
analysis revealed that all A. baumannii isolates carried
blaOXA-58 or blaOXA-23 genes while the 45 carbapenem￾resistant strains of K. pneumoniae contained blaKPC-3.
Of the remaining 37 bacteria, 20 (Escerichia coli (n = 8);
Enterobacter spp. (n = 6); Serratia marcescens (n = 4);
and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2)) were isolated
in VAP patients and 17 in the remaining patients (Esceri￾chia coli (n = 2); Enterobacter spp. (n = 1); Morganella
morganii (n = 1); Citrobacter freundii (n = 1); Staphylococ￾cus aureus (n = 7); Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2); and
Enterococcus spp. (n = 3)). Of these microorganisms 22
(59.5%) were classified as MDR and most of them were
isolated in patients treated with SD TGC (48% versus
20%, P <0.01).
Infections due to less susceptible bacteria (TGC min￾imal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value 1 to 2 mcg/mL)
were mainly treated with higher doses (68% versus 36%,
P <0.01). During the three-year study the percentage
of patients treated with HD TGC increased (15% (year 1)

versus 77% (year 3); P = 0.01) according to a significant in￾crease of bacteria harboring MIC values of 1 to 2 mcg/mL
(39% (year 1) versus 80% (year 3); P = 0.03) (Figure 2).
Outcomes of patients with VAP according to dose of TGC
Patients with VAP treated with SD or HD TGC were
similar in their baseline clinical conditions, disease sever￾ity and principal comorbidities (Table 1). Although not
statistically significant, duration of TGC therapy was lon￾ger (9.0 versus 6.5 days, P = 0.13) in the HD group
than in the SD one. The rate of IIAT (57.5% versus
46.6%, P = 0.38) was similar in the two groups. HD
TGC was preferred for treating infections caused by
difficult-to-treat bacteria (TGC MIC 1 to 2 mcg/mL) and
to K. pneumoniae (P <0.001; P = 0.03).
The clinical cure rate and microbiological eradication
percentage were higher when TGC was used at higher
doses (57.5 versus 33.3; P = 0.05, and 57.1% versus 30.4%;
P = 0.07, respectively). However, microbiological eradica￾tion was analyzed in only 44 patients, 23 in the SD TGC
group and 21 in HD TGC group. The overall mortality in
the VAP group was 57%, without differences between the
two groups.
Predictors of clinical cure in patients with VAP
The univariate analysis (Table 2) of the 63 patients with
VAP showed that individuals with clinical failure were
older, had a higher SOFA score and a shorter duration
of TGC treatment than the patients with a successful
clinical outcome. No specific antibiotic combination was
associated with a better outcome. The logistic regression
analysis indicates that the use of high dose TGC was the
sole independent predictor of clinical cure (OR 6.25,
95% CI 1.59, 24.57), instead a higher SOFA score (OR
0.66, 95% CI 0.51, 0.87), and IIAT (OR 0.18, 95% CI
0.05, 0.68) was significantly associated with clinical fail￾ure (Table 3).
Adverse events
In the overall population the rate of abnormal laboratory
measures during the treatment period was similar be￾tween SD and HD TGC-treated patients. No patients
required TGC discontinuation or dose reduction. For
all AE the maximum grade was 2 (moderate). Similar
results were also obtained on stratifying patients by the
type of infection (that is, VAP versus infections other than
VAP) (Table 4).
Discussion
In this study we found that the use of HD TGC (100 mg
every 12 hours following a 200 mg loading dose) was
well-tolerated in a cohort of critically ill patients affected
by nosocomial infections. In the VAP subgroup population
(all episodes due to Gram-negative germs), the HD TGC
was independently associated with a six-fold increase in
clinical cure. Conversely an IIAT and a higher SOFA score
were independent predictors of clinical failure. The associ￾ation of increased TGC dosage and improved outcome is
coherent with previous clinical observations regarding this
and other molecules [4,19,20].
Recently, an HD TGC regimen has been success￾fully used in combination with other active antimicro￾bials in 22 critically ill patients with K. pneumoniae
Carbapenemase-producing (KPC) K. pneumoniae in￾fections (mainly VAP and BSI) [21]. The authors re￾ported a high percentage of favorable response (88%
clinical cure and 92% survival), probably due to the
specific case mix of that population, represented by
young trauma patients without significant comorbidi￾ties and septic shock.
TGC effectively penetrates skin, soft tissues and intra￾abdominal organs but several concerns have been raised
about its distribution in the lung. In a phase-3 trial [22]
this molecule was compared with imipenem for the
treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, without reach￾ing non-inferiority criteria in the subset of patients with

VAP. Moreover, some authors [23] have observed that
TGC lung concentrations in intracellular epithelial lining
fluid (ELF) were remarkably higher than in the extracellu￾lar fluid and serum. This observation has suggested the
use of higher dosages in order to treat pneumonia caused
by MDR pathogens. These data were also confirmed
by a recent multicenter PK study in children affected
by serious infections, where a dose of 1.2 mg/kg every
12 hours better correlated with the target AUC0–24:
MIC90 ratios [24]. Hence, although TGC lung levels
in infected patients are expected to be higher than
healthy volunteers, standard doses are probably inad￾equate to reach maximally efficacy, especially against
MDR pathogens on the upper end of the MIC distribution

and < = 2 mg/L, respectively. All dosages were adjusted for creatinine clearance if necessary. Gentamycin and amikacin peak and trough plasmatic levels were

(1 to 2 mcg/ml). Recently, in a randomized phase-2 trial,
treatment with HD TGC (100 mg every 12 hours) was
associated with a better clinical response than imipenem
treated patients, in nosocomial pneumonia caused by
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This clinical
result was supported by the favourable PK-PD profile
observed in HD TGC treated patients [6].
Few other authors have reported the treatment of
MDR severe infections with TGC at higher than stand￾ard doses. Cunha [25] described the successful use of
this molecule, up to 200 mg every 24 hours, during
urinary tract infection/urosepsis, reporting no adverse
effects. Similarly Lewinski et al. [26] reported a case of
PDR K. pneumoniae pneumonia and bacteremia resolved
with a combination of colistin and HD TGC. In general,
TGC use is associated with few significant AE other than
nausea and vomiting [27,28], but two recent meta￾analyses documented that this molecule administration
was associated with more AE than comparative drugs
[29,30]. Not surprisingly, the most frequently reported

AE (nausea and vomiting) had no impact in our cohort
of critically ill patients, who were sedated and mecha￾nically ventilated. To date there are limited data for AE re￾lated to the use of HD TGC [25,28]. In our cohort, the
percentage of patients who manifested biochemical
abnormalities, grading the AE, varied between 10% and
20%. Anyway, the retrospective design of this study does
not allow an accurate estimation of the TGC contribution
to these abnormalities. Hence, due to the high severity of
our study patients, other factors might have exerted a cru￾cial role affecting organ functions.
The overall ICU mortality observed in the entire
cohort (100 patients) was high (57%) and only about half
of patients achieved clinical cure or microbiological
eradication (48% and 41%, respectively). These data
might be explained by the relevant severity of illness:
about 50% of them were in septic shock, 24% were
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
and 35% had concomitant bacteremia. Recent reports
suggest the usefulness of combination antimicrobial
schemes including TGC, mainly during the treatment
of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae infections [21,31].
However, despite the combined antimicrobial therapy
strategy we have adopted, the percentage of IIAT was
high (49%), and possibly responsible for the relevant rate
of the observed unfavorable outcomes [32].
In our institution the use of HD TGC constantly
increased over the study period, concomitantly with the
shift towards less susceptible bacteria (Figure 2). The
trend to increase TGC dosage used was probably influ￾enced by the awareness of progressive increase in TGC
MIC values in MDR germs isolated in our hospital, with
the aim to avoid suboptimal doses for the management
of difficult-to-treat infections.
Our study has several limitations. First, this is a single￾center, retrospective analysis with a relatively small
number of patients. Second, in almost all the patient
TGC was used in addition to another active molecule
and therefore we cannot draw any conclusion regarding
the efficacy of HD TGC as monotherapy. Finally, we did
not monitor the plasmatic and tissue concentrations that
could confirm our clinical observations. However, to our
knowledge, this is the largest comparative clinical study
where the use of HD TGC has been described.
Conclusions
These data suggest that TGC, used at doses higher than
standard treatment, can be administered without rele￾vant toxicity for the treatment of serious infections in
critically ill sedated patients. The regimen with higher
TGC doses (that is, 100 mg every 12 hours after a
200 mg loading dose) may be useful to improve the
clinical outcome of patients with MDR Gram-negative
VAP. Pharmacokinetic investigations and multicenter,
prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these
preliminary results and investigate the efficacy of HD
TGC in severe infections.
Key messages
 The use of TGC at higher than standard doses is
safe in critically ill patients
 The high TGC dosing regimen improves the
outcome of patients with MDR Gram-negative VAP
