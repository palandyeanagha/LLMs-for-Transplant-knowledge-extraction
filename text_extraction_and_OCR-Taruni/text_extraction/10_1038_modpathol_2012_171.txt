We previously described restrictive allograft syndrome as a form of chronic lung allograft dysfunction,
demonstrating restrictive pulmonary function decline. However, the histopathological correlates of restrictive
allograft syndrome have yet to be satisfactorily described. We hypothesized that pulmonary pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis, as has recently been described in bone marrow transplant recipients, may also be present in the
lungs of patients with restrictive allograft syndrome. Retrospective review of 493 patients who underwent lung
transplantation between 1 January 1996 and 30 June 2009, was conducted. Out of 47 patients with clinical
features of restrictive allograft syndrome, 16 had wedge biopsy, re-transplant lung explant, or autopsy lung
specimens available for review. All lungs showed varying degrees of pleural fibrosis. Fifteen of 16 showed
parenchymal fibroelastosis, characterized by hypocellular collagen deposition with preservation and
thickening of the underlying alveolar septal elastic network. The fibroelastosis was predominantly subpleural
in distribution, with some cases also showing centrilobular and paraseptal distribution. A sharp demarcation
was often seen between areas of fibroelastosis and unaffected lung parenchyma, with fibroblastic foci often
present at this interface. Concurrent features of obliterative bronchiolitis were present in 14 cases. Another
common finding was the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (13 cases), usually in specimens obtained o1
year after clinical onset of restrictive allograft syndrome. The single specimen in which fibroelastosis was not
identified was obtained before the clinical onset of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and showed features of
diffuse alveolar damage. In conclusion, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis is a major histopathologic correlate
of restrictive allograft syndrome, and was often found concurrently with diffuse alveolar damage. Our findings
support a temporal sequence of diffuse alveolar damage followed by the development of pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis in the histopathologic evolution of restrictive allograft syndrome.

Increasing evidence suggests that chronic lung
allograft dysfunction following lung transplantation
is a heterogeneous condition that includes bronch￾iolitis obliterans syndrome as well as other types of
allograft dysfunction. Although bronchiolitis oblit￾erans syndrome, characterized clinically by irrever￾sible obstructive deficits in pulmonary function
tests,1–4 remains the major cause of late mortality,
we recently described a distinct form of chronic
lung allograft dysfunction demonstrating restrictive
pulmonary function decline, which we designated
restrictive allograft syndrome,5 and which accounts
for 25–35% of chronic lung allograft dysfunc￾tion.5,6 Radiologically, a significant proportion of
these patients demonstrated an unusual pattern of

interstitial fibrosis, often upper lobe-predominant,
associated with traction bronchiectasis in computed
tomography scans. Although initial review of
restrictive allograft syndrome cases confirmed the
presence of interstitial fibrosis,5 the histopatho￾logical correlates of restrictive allograft syndrome
have yet to be satisfactorily described.
Idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis was
first proposed as a novel, distinct clinicopathologi￾cal entity in 2004 by Frankel et al,
7 to describe cases
of upper lobe-predominant pleural and subpleural
fibrosis with a clinical presentation suggestive of a
chronic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Several
cases and small series with similar radiologic and
pathologic features have also been reported.8–14
Radiologically, idiopathic pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis has been characterized by pleural
thickening associated with underlying parenchy￾mal reticular abnormalities, architectural distortion
and traction bronchiectasis in a mostly upper lobe￾predominant distribution.7,10,11 Histologically, idio￾pathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis is chara￾cterized by pronounced visceral pleural fibrosis
associated with subpleural, ‘intra-alveolar’ fibrotic
changes characterized by an admixture of elastic
and fibrous tissue (fibroelastosis).
In a recent report, von der Thusen et al15
described four cases of pulmonary disease follow￾ing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation that
presented with pneumothoraces and were found to
demonstrate histopathologic features of pleuro￾parenchymal fibroelastosis. Histologically, chronic
graft-vs-host-disease may present with a variety of
patterns in the lung, including bronchiolitis
obliterans.16,17 In view of the fact that patients
with chronic graft-vs-host-disease often demonstrate
bronchiolitis obliterans that is reminiscent of that
seen in lung transplant recipients with chronic lung
allograft dysfunction, we hypothesized that pleur￾oparenchymal fibroelastosis might represent an
important histopathologic correlate of post-lung
transplant restrictive allograft syndrome. We report
here evidence that pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis
is indeed a major histopathologic correlate of
restrictive allograft syndrome.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Research Ethics
Board of University Health Network. Patients with
restrictive allograft syndrome were identified as
previously described,5 by retrospective review of
493 patients who underwent bilateral lung (n ¼ 478)
or heart-lung (n ¼ 15) transplantation in the Toronto
Lung Transplant Program between 1 January 1996
and 30 June 2009.
Restrictive allograft syndrome was defined as
previously described,5 as an irreversible decline in
total lung capacity to o90% of baseline con￾current with the presence of chronic lung allograft
dysfunction, which was defined as an irreversible
decline in forced expiratory volume (1 s) to o80%.
In total, 16 specimens (5 wedge biopsies, 4 lungs
explanted for retransplantation, 7 autopsies) from 16
patients with restrictive allograft syndrome were
available for review. Specimens were processed
according to routine surgical pathology protocols.
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were
reviewed for all cases, with elastic trichrome or
Movat stains for representative tissue blocks in
selected cases. The cases were assessed for
histopathological findings by two pathologists with
pulmonary expertise (EO and DMH), including:
degree of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (0,
none; 1, 40–10% of area; 2, 410–25%; 3, 425–
50%; 4, 450%) and distribution (subpleural, para￾septal, centrilobular or parenchymal) of pleuro￾parenchymal fibroelastosis; presence of bronchio￾litis obliterans within and/or outside the areas of
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis; histological
features at the interface between pleuroparen￾chymal fibroelastosis and uninvolved lung
parenchyma (whether this margin was abrupt or
not, presence of fibroblastic foci); presence of
honeycomb changes or other distinct histopatho￾logical patterns of chronic interstitial pneumonia;
presence of diffuse alveolar damage; and presence of
vascular changes.
The latest computed tomography scans before the
pathology specimen for these patients were ob￾tained. Images were acquired on different scanners
ranging from 4- to 64-row detectors. All studies were
blindly evaluated by two chest radiologists (UW and
HCR) as previously described.5
Results
Clinical and demographic characteristics of the 16
patients for whom pathology material was available
for review are summarized in Table 1. Computed
tomography scans were previously reviewed and
scored as part of our initial study of restrictive
allograft syndrome.5 These showed interstitial
opacity/reticulation in all cases, with 13 showing
reticulation in the upper lung zones, 12 in the
middle lung zones and 14 in the lower lung zones.
Upper lobe predominance was seen in eight
patients. Traction bronchiectasis was reported in
13 patients, with bronchial dilatation and bronchial
thickening reported in two patients each. Mosaic
attenuation was seen in two and air trapping in four.
Honeycombing was reported in three patients and
architectural distortion in eight.
All pathology specimens reviewed showed vary￾ing degrees of pleural fibrosis (Table 2). Fifteen of 16
specimens showed areas of pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis, characterized by confluent areas of
bland, hypocellular collagen deposition with pre￾servation and thickening of the underlying alveolar
septal elastic network (Figure 1). Patients who died

or were re-transplanted showed a trend toward
higher degrees of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis
(2.27±1.00; n ¼ 11) than patients undergoing wedge
biopsies for diagnostic purposes (1.20±1.10; n ¼ 5)
(P ¼ 0.09, t-test). The single specimen that did not
show pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis was a wedge
biopsy from a patient showing acute and organizing
diffuse alveolar damage, taken 2 months before the
clinical onset of chronic lung allograft dysfunction.
The areas of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis
were present predominantly in a subpleural dis￾tribution, but in some cases were also paraseptal,
centrilobular or more random (parenchymal) in
distribution (Table 2, Figure 2). Areas of fibroelas￾tosis often demonstrated a sharp demarcation with
adjacent unaffected lung parenchyma (Figure 3a),
with fibroblastic foci often present at this interface
(Figure 3b).
Concurrent histologic features of obliterative or
constrictive bronchiolitis were identified in 14 cases
(Figure 4), including 10 of 11 patients who died or
were re-transplanted, and 4 of 5 cases of patients
undergoing wedge biopsy. Affected airways were

identified within areas of confluent pleuroparench￾ymal fibroelastosis in a majority of cases (9/16)
(Figure 4a), as well as in adjacent uninvolved lung
(12/16) (Figure 4b). This was associated with
postobstructive changes such as intra-alveolar foa￾my macrophages and cholesterol cleft formation in
12/16 cases.
Another common finding was the presence of
acute and/or organizing phase diffuse alveolar
damage (13/16 cases), characterized by the presence
of intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates (Figure 5a) and/
or areas of alveolar septal thickening associated with
organizing pneumonia and reactive pneumocyte
hyperplasia (Figure 5b). In seven cases, areas of
diffuse alveolar damage appeared to merge into
areas of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (Figure 5c
and d). The three specimens not showing diffuse
alveolar damage were all obtained Z18 months
(mean 46.7±38.2 months) after the clinical onset of
chronic lung allograft dysfunction, whereas all 13
specimens showing diffuse alveolar damage were
obtained r15 months after the onset of chronic lung
allograft dysfunction (mean 4.4±5.2 months, with

Other findings included acute and/or organizing
thromboemboli (six cases), foci of acute bronchop￾neumonia (six cases) and areas of nonspecific
interstitial pneumonia-like fibrosis (four cases). A
single case showed focal areas of microscopic
honeycomb change similar to that seen in usual
interstitial pneumonia, but this was not a prominent
feature, and similar areas were not seen in any of the
other cases.
Discussion
Although bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome had
long been considered virtually synonymously with
chronic lung allograft dysfunction in lung transplant
recipients, recent evidence suggests that chronic
lung allograft dysfunction in fact displays a range of
phenotypes distinct from bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome.5,6,18,19 We previously reported a signi￾ficant subset of patients with chronic lung allograft
dysfunction who displayed restrictive functional
changes, which we designated as restrictive allograft
syndrome.5 Patients with restrictive allograft synd￾rome were found to demonstrate significantly poorer
survival following the onset of chronic lung allograft
dysfunction than patients with bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome (median survival: 541 vs 1421
days, respectively).5
Our present study of 16 patients with restrictive
allograft syndrome is, to our knowledge, the first
reporting pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis as a
major histopathologic correlate of restrictive allo￾graft syndrome, and the largest single series of
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis cases to date.
Idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis as a
distinct entity was first proposed by Frankel et al7
in 2004. It is characterized radiologically by features
suggestive of a chronic interstitial pneumonia with
upper lobe predominance, and histologically by
pleural fibrosis and parenchymal fibroelastosis in a
predominantly subpleural distribution, with a sharp
demarcation between fibroelastotic and unaffected
lung parenchyma, and with the presence of
fibroblastic foci at this interface. A limited number
of cases with similar radiologic and pathologic
features have also been reported,8–14 including a
very recent article by Reddy et al,14 suggesting a
broader spectrum of histopathologic findings.
In our present study, we found typical features of
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in all patients in
whom clinical onset of restrictive allograft syn￾drome pre-dated the lung pathology specimen. The
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in these cases was
predominantly subpleural; however, unlike most
previous reports of pleuroparenchymal fibroelasto￾sis, involvement in other areas (eg centrilobular,
paraseptal) was also noted in a significant minority
of cases.
Concurrent obliterative bronchiolitis was identi￾fied in a majority of cases, an observation that
mirrors the finding by von der Thusen et al,
15 of
obliterative bronchiolitis in 4 of 4 patients with
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis post bone marrow
transplantation. This finding suggests that although
patients with restrictive allograft syndrome should
not be classified as bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome due to their distinct clinical, radiologic
and pathologic features, the decline in pulmonary
function in patients with restrictive allograft
syndrome may result from a combination of
restrictive deficits secondary to pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis and varying degrees of obstructive
deficits resulting from concurrent obliterative
bronchiolitis.
Consistent with our recent finding that onset of
restrictive allograft syndrome is often preceded by
the presence of diffuse alveolar damage in biop￾sies,20 we further found that pleuroparenchymal

fibroelastosis in restrictive allograft syndrome
patients was very often present concurrently with
features of diffuse alveolar damage. Specimens
obtained o1 year after clinical onset of chronic
lung allograft dysfunction typically demonstrated
features of diffuse alveolar damage, whereas those
obtained at intervals of a year or more after chronic
lung allograft dysfunction onset showed diffuse
alveolar damage less frequently. These findings,
together with the finding in some cases of diffuse
alveolar damage appearing to merge into areas of
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (Figure 5c), sup￾port a temporal sequence of diffuse alveolar damage
preceding the development of pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis in the natural history of restrictive
allograft syndrome.
The etiologic factors underlying restrictive allo￾graft syndrome and pleuroparenchymal fibroelasto￾sis remain uncertain. Our identification of
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in the setting of
chronic lung allograft dysfunction, taken together
with the recent report of pleuroparenchymal fibroe￾lastosis following allogeneic bone marrow trans￾plantation,15 as well as the finding of auto-anti￾bodies in some patients with pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis,14 could suggest a contributing
immunologic mechanism. On the other hand, the
presence of concurrent diffuse alveolar damage in a
large proportion of restrictive allograft syndrome￾pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis cases may also
suggest that pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis
represents a more non-specific late sequela of
diffuse alveolar damage, which would be in
keeping with the suggestion made by von der
Thusen et al that pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis
in post-bone marrow transplant patients may
represent a late complication of post-bone marrow
transplant idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, which
has a high mortality rate and is characterized
clinically and radiologically by features consistent

with diffuse alveolar damage.15 If so, pleuroparen￾chymal fibroelastosis may represent a late compli￾cation of multiple and varied etiologic factors that
result in acute lung injury/diffuse alveolar damage,
including chemo/radiotherapy7,10,11,15 and infec￾tions.14 Finally, the finding of acute and/or organi￾zing thromboemboli in our series raises the question
of the role of vascular injury in the pathophysiology
of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. However, as
thromboembolism may often be seen in the setting
of diffuse alveolar damage and all instances of
thromboemboli in this study were associated with
diffuse alveolar damage, the significance of this
finding to the development of pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis is uncertain.
Chronic lung allograft dysfunction is the major
factor today that limits long-term survival in lung
transplant patients. We have previously demon￾strated that chronic lung allograft dysfunction has
distinct subtypes, of which restrictive allograft
syndrome is a distinct form with clinical, biological
and radiologic features and a more aggressive and
rapidly progressive clinical course than bronchioli￾tis obliterans syndrome. Our novel observations in
this report demonstrate that pleuroparenchymal
fibroelastosis is a major histopathologic correlate of
restrictive allograft syndrome in lung transplant
recipients. Our findings further support a temporal
connection between pleuroparenchymal fibroelasto￾sis and antecedent diffuse alveolar damage, the
nature of which needs to be further delineated.
