Abstract
Dietary phosphorus (P) restriction is known to ameliorate
secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure patients. In
early renal failure, this effect may be mediated by an in￾crease in 1,25-(OH)2D3
, whereas in advanced renal failure,
P restriction can act independent of changes in 1,25-
(OH)2D3
 and serum ionized calcium (ICa). In this study, we
examined the effects of dietary P on serum PTH, PTH
mRNA, and parathyroid gland (PTG) hyperplasia in ure￾mic rats. Normal and uremic rats were maintained on a low
(0.2%) or high (0.8%) P diet for 2 mo. PTG weight and se￾rum PTH were similar in both groups of normal rats and in
uremic rats fed the 0.2% P diet. In contrast, there were sig￾nificant increases in serum PTH (130625 vs. 3563.5 pg/ml,
P , 0.01), PTG weight (1.8060.13 vs. 0.8860.06 mg/gram
of body weight, P , 0.01), and PTG DNA (1.6360.24 vs.
0.9460.07 mg DNA/gland, P , 0.01) in the uremic rats fed
the 0.8% P diet as compared with uremic rats fed the 0.2% P
diet. Serum ICa and 1,25-(OH)2D3
 were not altered over this
range of dietary P, suggesting a direct effect of P on PTG
function. We tested this possibility in organ cultures of rat
PTGs. While PTH secretion was acutely (30 min) regulated
by medium calcium, the effects of medium P were not evi￾dent until 3 h. During a 6-h incubation, PTH accumulation
was significantly greater in the 2.8 mM P medium than in
the 0.2 mM P medium (1,7066215 vs. 1,0336209 pg/mg
DNA, P , 0.02); the medium ICa was 1.25 mM in both con￾ditions. Medium P did not alter PTH mRNA in this system,
but cycloheximide (10 mg/ml) abolished the effect of P on
PTH secretion. Thus, the effect of P is posttranscriptional,
affecting PTH at a translational or posttranslational step.
Collectively, these in vivo and in vitro results demonstrate a
direct action of P on PTG function that is independent of
ICa and 1,25-(OH)2D3
. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:2534–2540.)

Introduction
The two major factors responsible for the development of sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal insufficiency are
phosphorus retention and low levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3
. Several
investigators have provided evidence for a role of phosphorus
retention in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroid￾ism, but the mechanism of this effect remains unclear. In nor￾mal humans (1) and in patients with moderate renal insuffi￾ciency (2), restriction of dietary phosphorus increases the
production rate of 1,25-(OH)2D3
, which in turn decreases the
level of immunoreactive PTH. However, this mechanism may
not be operative in advanced renal insufficiency because the
decrease in renal mass may limit the production of 1,25-
(OH)2D3
 (3–5). Lopez-Hilker and collaborators (6) demon￾strated in dogs with advanced renal insufficiency and severe
secondary hyperparathyroidism that a gradual reduction of
phosphorus in the diet was accompanied by a significant de￾crease in the levels of PTH without changes in ICa or 1,25-
(OH)2D3
. Although these data clearly demonstrated that the
effect of phosphorus on PTH secretion was independent of
changes in serum ICa and 1,25-(OH)2D3
, they did not evaluate
the role of phosphorus on parathyroid cell growth or establish
if phosphorus directly affected the synthesis or secretion of
PTH. Thus, the current studies were performed to further un￾derstand the role of phosphorus in the pathogenesis of second￾ary hyperparathyroidism. Studies were performed in vivo in
rats with chronic renal insufficiency and in vitro with dispersed
bovine parathyroid cells, primary culture of bovine parathy￾roid cells, and intact parathyroid glands from normal rats.
Methods
Renal insufficiency was induced in a group of female Sprague-Daw￾ley rats by 5/6 nephrectomy. The procedure entails the ligation of
most of the branches of the left renal artery followed by right nephrec￾tomy. The animals were divided into four groups: (a) normal rats fed
a 0.5% calcium and 0.2% phosphorus diet; (b) uremic rats fed a 0.5%
calcium and 0.2% phosphorus diet; (c) normal rats fed a 1% calcium
and 0.8% phosphorus diet; and (d) uremic rats fed a 1% calcium and
0.8% phosphorus diet. The 0.2% phosphorus diet is considered to be
a low phosphorus diet, and the 0.8% phosphorus diet is considered to
be a high phosphorus diet, although these two values are at the lower
and upper limits of normal phosphorus intake for the rat. The amount
of calcium in the 0.8% P diet was increased to 1% to prevent the de￾velopment of hypocalcemia, while the amount of calcium in the 0.2%
P diet was decreased to 0.5% to avoid hypercalcemia. After 2 mo on
the above diets, the rats were killed and blood was obtained for ICa,
phosphorus, creatinine, PTH, and 1,25-(OH)2D3
. The parathyroid
glands were removed and weighed. DNA, protein, and pre-pro PTH
mRNA were measured.
Preparation of dispersed cells of bovine parathyroid glands. Parathy￾roid cells were prepared according to the method of MacGregor et al.

Phosphorus and Secondary Hyperparathyroidism 2535
(7) with minor modifications. Briefly, parathyroid glands were
trimmed of extraneous fatty tissue, sliced with a Stadie-Riggs tissue
slicer (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) and placed in DME
(HG)/Ham’s F-12 culture medium (50/50) containing 2.5 mg/ml colla￾genase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.5 mM total
calcium. The suspension (1 gram of tissue per 10 ml of media) was ag￾itated in a shaking water bath at 378C for 90 min and periodically as￾pirated through a large-bore hole cut in an Eppendorf pipette tip at￾tached to a 60-ml syringe. The digested tissue was filtered through
four-ply gauze, and newborn calf serum was added to a final concen￾tration of 4%. The cells were washed three times with chilled, serum￾free culture medium, DME (HG)/Ham’s F-12 medium (50/50), con￾taining 1 mM total calcium, 15 mM Hepes, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100
mg/ml streptomycin, 5 mg/ml insulin, 2 mM glutamine, 1% nonessen￾tial amino acids, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mg/ml holo￾transferrin. The cells were kept on ice.
Treatment media were prepared as follows. Monobasic sodium
phosphate, pH 7.5, was added to final concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, or 3.0
mM to phosphate-free DME (HG)/Ham’s F-12 medium (50/50) con￾taining the supplements listed above. Cells were resuspended in treat￾ment media at 0.5 3 106
 cells/ml and placed in uncapped 7-ml
polypropylene scintillation vials (1 ml cells/vial). The vials were gently
agitated at 378C in a 5% CO2
 incubator for 4 h. Cells were pelleted,
and the supernatant was stored at 2208C until PTH analysis could be
performed. Cell pellets were stored at 2208C and subsequently ana￾lyzed for DNA following the method of LePecq and Paoletti (8).
PTH was assayed using antibody CH9, which recognized intact, mid￾region, and carboxy-terminal fragments of PTH. Details of the recog￾nition characteristics of the antisera and the RIA methodology have
been described previously (9).
PTH secretion in primary culture of bovine parathyroid cells.
Dispersed cells were resuspended in medium (described above) con￾taining 4% newborn calf serum and placed in 12-well plates at 80,000
cells/cm2
. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free me￾dium. On the third day in culture, cells were treated with medium con￾taining 0.1, 1.0, or 3.0 mM P for another 72 h. Medium was replen￾ished every 24 h. To determine the rate of PTH secretion, cells were
washed twice and then incubated in fresh medium for 3 h at 378C in
5% CO2
. The medium was collected for PTH analysis as described above.
Cellular protein in each sample was determined by sonicating the
cells in 1 mM NaOH and assaying with a protein assay kit (Bio Rad
Laboratories, Richmond, CA).
Measurement of parathyroid gland weight. To evaluate parathy￾roid gland weight, parathyroid glands were removed using microsur￾gical techniques and weighed on a CAHN C-31 microbalance (Cahn
Instruments, Inc., Cerritos, CA). Coefficient of variance was 1.5%.
Parathyroid secretion by rat parathyroid glands. Rat parathyroid
gland pairs were excised from surrounding thyroid tissue and imme￾diately placed on ice in 12-well plates containing the appropriate ex￾perimental medium prepared as described above for the studies in
bovine cells to contain 0.2 or 2.8 mM P and the designated concentra￾tion of Ca. Glands were transferred to a 5% CO2
 incubator and incu￾bated at 378C for 30 min. Glands were then transferred to wells con￾taining 2 ml of fresh media and incubated at 378C with 5% CO2
.
Media were sampled at 1, 3, and 5 h for PTH determinations and at 5 h
for ICa levels. After 5 h the glands were washed with medium three
times and 1 ml of fresh medium was added. After 1 h the medium was
removed for ICa and PTH determinations and the glands were placed
in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1 M Tris-HCl and fro￾zen at 2208C for DNA analysis (7).
Analysis of pre-pro PTH mRNA. On the third day of culture, the
medium from bovine parathyroid cell monolayers was replaced with
defined medium containing either 0.1, 1.0, or 3.0 mM P. The mono￾layers received fresh medium every 24 h. Cells were lysed at various
times with RNAzol (Cinna/Biotecx, Friendswood, TX) and total
RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot analysis as de￾scribed previously (10).
Parathyroid gland pairs from rats were homogenized in 250 ml
RNAzol (Cinna Biotecx) in a microfuge tube using a plastic pestle.
Total RNA was isolated as directed by the manufacturer and ana￾lyzed by a ribonuclease protection assay. Riboprobes for rat PTH
were produced using SP6 RNA polymerase and a template contain￾ing bases 122–461 of the coding sequence of the rat PTH gene (pro￾vided by Jeremiah Morrissey, Ph.D., Washington University). A ribo￾probe for rat b2-actin was made using T7 RNA polymerase and an
RT-PCR cDNA cloned into pCR II (provided by Alan Dean, Ph.D.,
Washington University). The sizes of the riboprobes and protected
fragments were 380 and 339 for PTH and 280 and 250 for b-actin, re￾spectively.
RNA from each parathyroid gland pair (20% of the total) was
dissolved in 10 ml hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 50 mM
Pipes, pH 6.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and mixed with the 32P￾labeled riboprobes for PTH and b-actin and dissolved in 30 ml hybrid￾ization buffer. To reduce background, the specific activity of the ribo￾probes for PTH and b-actin was adjusted to obtain labeled protected
fragments with similar radioactivity. After hybridization at 458C for
16 h, the samples were mixed with 150 ml of ribonuclease digestion
mixture consisting of 2 mg/ml ribonuclease T1 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA. Proteinase K (50 mg) and 20 ml
of 5% SDS were added, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at
378C. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation,
the samples were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 8.3 M urea,
100 mM Tris-borate, and 2 mM EDTA. The dried gel was exposed to
x-ray film for 16 h, and the bands were quantified by scanning densi￾tometry.

electrode (model 1CA-1; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Results
The effect of dietary P restriction on the development of sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism in uremic rats was determined af￾ter 2 mo of renal insufficiency.
Table I illustrates the body weights and serum chemistries
in uremic and normal control rats fed diets containing 0.2% P
or 0.8% P for the 2-mo period. As expected, the serum creati￾nine and blood urea nitrogen increased in the uremic animals.
ICa and 1,25-(OH)2D3
 were the same in all four groups of ani￾mals. Serum phosphorus increased in the animals ingesting the
high phosphorus diet, but was significantly elevated only in the
uremic animals (P , 0.01).
Uremic rats fed the 0.2% phosphorus diet had serum PTH
levels that did not differ from either group of normal rats (P 5
NS). However, serum PTH was significantly increased in ure￾mic rats fed the 0.8% phosphorus diet compared with uremic
rats receiving the low P diet (130625 vs. 3563.5 pg/ml, P ,
0.001) (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows a positive correlation between se￾rum phosphorus and PTH levels in the rats fed the 0.8% phos￾phorus diet (n 5 29, P , 0.0001, r 5 0.859). In uremic rats fed
the 0.2% phosphorus diet, the weight of the parathyroid
glands did not differ from either group of normal rats (P 5
NS). On the other hand, in uremic rats fed the 0.8% phospho￾rus diet, parathyroid gland weight increased from 0.88260.05
to 1.8060.13 mg/gram of body weight (P , 0.001) (Fig. 3). To
further characterize the growth of the parathyroid glands,
DNA and protein were determined. These results are shown in
Fig. 4. Parathyroid gland DNA and protein were substantially
greater (P , 0.01) in the uremic rats fed the 0.8% phosphorus
diet (n 5 10), when compared with the normal rats (n 5 7) fed
the same diet. The magnitudes of the increases in DNA and
protein in this group were similar, indicating that hyperplasia
was responsible for the increase in the size of the parathyroid
glands. Moreover, there was a direct correlation between para￾thyroid gland DNA and serum PTH in uremic rats fed a 0.2%
(n 5 13) and 0.8% (n 5 10) phosphorus diet. Regression anal￾ysis indicated a correlation coefficient of 0.739 and a P , 0.001
(n 5 23) (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the correlation between
intact PTH and serum ICa was not statistically significant (r 5
0.089). To further characterize the changes in the parathyroid
glands, steady state pre-pro PTH mRNA levels were measured
(Fig. 6). No difference in the PTH/actin mRNA ratio was de￾tected (n 5 8). Thus, these in vivo studies show a significant ef￾fect of phosphorus restriction on PTH secretion and parathy￾roid cell growth which is independent of the levels of ICa and
1,25-(OH)2D3
.
Studies were then conducted in vitro to determine if phos￾phorus has a direct effect on parathyroid cell function. Initial
studies examined dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. During a
30 min incubation period, media phosphorus (0.1, 1.0, or 3.0
mM) did not affect the secretion of PTH (n 5 6). On the other
hand, when ICa was increased from 0.2 to 3.0 mM, PTH secre￾tion decreased by 40%. Subsequent studies were performed in
primary culture of bovine parathyroid cells. Varying medium
phosphorus (0.1, 1.0, or 3.0 mM) for 24, 48, or 72 h had no ef￾fect on PTH secretion (n 5 26) or PTH/GAPDH mRNA (n 5
8) (data not shown). Moreover, phosphorus did not modify the
suppressive effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3
 on PTH secretion (n 5 6).
Since the preparation of dispersed bovine parathyroid cells
and primary culture of bovine parathyroid cells alter the nor￾mal parathyroid gland structure, we decided to perform stud￾ies using intact rat parathyroid glands. When freshly dissected
parathyroid glands from normal rats were incubated for 1 h
with high or low Ca medium, the secretion of PTH decreased
by z 40% by increasing Ca from 0.2 to 3 mM. Increasing phos￾phorus in the medium from 0.2 to 2.8 mM, however, did not
change PTH secretion (Fig. 7, n 5 8) during a 1-h incubation.
Therefore, we followed PTH secretion in rat parathyroid or￾gan cultures for up to 6 h. Fig. 8 shows the accumulation of
PTH in medium of parathyroid glands incubated on a low (0.2
mM) or high (2.8 mM) phosphorus diet. After 3 h of incuba￾tion, there was a statistically greater amount of PTH secreted
into the media of the glands incubated with 2.8 mM phospho￾Figure 2. Regression analysis between serum PTH (pg/ml) and se￾rum phosphorus in the rats fed the 0.8% phosphorus diet.

rus. At the end of 6 h, the amount of PTH secreted was
1,0336209 pg/mg DNA in the 0.2 mM phosphorus versus
1,7066215 pg/mg DNA in the medium containing 2.8 mM
phosphorus (P , 0.05). To determine if the lower values for
PTH secretion on the low phosphorus medium were due to an
alteration in the secretory mechanism due to phosphorus de￾pletion, the glands were incubated in media containing low
(0.2 mM) phosphorus and normal (1.25 mM) calcium for a pe￾riod of 4 h and then incubated in either low phosphorus, low
calcium (0.2 mM) medium, or a low phosphorus, high calcium
(2.6 mM) medium for an additional 2 h (Fig. 9). PTH secretion
was substantially greater in the low calcium medium (702.86
164 pg/mg DNA) than in the medium containing high calcium
(50.8613.2 pg/mg DNA). Thus, these results clearly indicate
that after 4 h of incubation in a low phosphorus medium the
parathyroid glands were still able to respond appropriately to
calcium. To determine if protein synthesis was critical in the
increase in PTH secretion in a high phosphorus medium, rat
parathyroid glands were incubated in a medium containing cy￾cloheximide (10 mg/ml). The addition of cycloheximide pre￾vented the increase in PTH secretion induced by the high
phosphorus medium (n 5 6) (results not shown).
To confirm that cycloheximide did not produce irreversible
cellular damage after a 6-h incubation, glands were washed
several times and then exposed to high or low calcium me￾dium. They responded properly to the concentrations of cal￾Figure 6. PTH/actin mRNA ratio in parathyroid glands from normal

cium in the medium (results not shown). To determine if the
increased synthesis of PTH was at the mRNA level, a ribonu￾clease protection assay was performed using RNA extracted
from rat parathyroid glands incubated in 0.2 or 2.8 mM P.
Phosphorus did not influence the PTH/actin mRNA (n 5 8)

Discussion
In 1937, in a classic paper, Truman G. Drake, Fuller Albright,
and Benjamin Castleman (13) studied parathyroid hyperplasia
in rabbits produced by parenteral phosphate administration.
They concluded “the findings support the hypothesis that re￾tention of phosphate is the cause of parathyroid hyperplasia in
cases of renal insufficiency; it will require further studies to
show whether the hyperphosphatemia causes hyperplasia di￾rectly, or indirectly, by producing hypocalcemia.” A number of
studies have attributed the effect of phosphate on hyperpara￾thyroidism to secondary alterations in serum ICa and 1,25-
(OH)2D3
 (1, 2, 14–19). While it is clear that phosphorus intake
can regulate these two modulators of parathyroid gland func￾tion, phosphate may also exert a direct action of the parathy￾roid glands.
We found that mild phosphate restriction (0.2% P vs. 0.8%
P diet) could prevent hyperparathyroidism in uremic rats. The
higher phosphate diet increased PTH levels and produced
hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands. The effect of dietary P
intake could not be attributed to differences in ICa or 1,25-
(OH)2D3
 since they were the same in the two groups. The hy￾perparathyroidism produced by the higher P diet was not ac￾companied by an increase in pre-pro PTH mRNA, suggesting
that the high PTH levels were due to increased gland size and
posttranscriptional enhancement of PTH synthesis and/or se￾cretion.
We investigated this apparently direct action of phospho￾rus in vitro. We found no effect of phosphorus on PTH secre￾tion in dispersed or cultured bovine parathyroid cells. Thus, it
appears that in either short-term (studies with dispersed cells)
or in primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells, phosphorus
does not affect PTH secretion. We speculate that cell–cell contact
or cell–matrix interactions may be necessary for the effect of
phosphorus on PTH secretion. This concept is supported by
our studies with intact parathyroid glands of normal rats.
Short-term experiments (1 h) (Fig. 7) indicated that changing
the concentration of phosphorus from 0.2 to 2.8 mM did not
affect PTH secretion, but the glands responded to changes in
extracellular calcium under these conditions. Long-term incu￾bations of the parathyroid glands revealed an effect of high
phosphorus by 3 h. This time requirement suggests that phos￾Figure 9. PTH secretion by normal rat parathyroid glands incubated

phosphorus were not evident until 3 h.

phorus alters the rate of PTH synthesis rather than secretion.
Addition of cycloheximide abolished the enhanced accumula￾tion of PTH in the medium, indicating that new protein synthe￾sis is mandatory for phosphorus to increase the secretion of PTH.
We did not see an effect of phosphorus on PTH mRNA af￾ter a 6-h incubation of intact parathyroid glands in high P me￾dia, which is consistent with our findings in vivo. In contrast, in
a recent paper Kilav et al. (20) also demonstrated an effect of
phosphorus on PTH, but they found that high dietary phos￾phorus led to an increase in PTH mRNA. However, the two
experimental conditions were not identical. Their studies were
performed in normal, 3-wk-old rats while our studies were
done using adult uremic rats. Their low phosphorus diet pro￾duced significant increases in both 1,25-(OH)2D3
 and serum
calcium; therefore subsequent studies were done in second
generation rats fed a vitamin D–deficient diet to prevent dif￾ferences in 1,25D and calcium. These dissimilar experimental
conditions could account for disparate PTH mRNA results.
Regardless of the precise mechanism(s) of action by which di￾etary phosphorus restriction suppresses PTH secretion, both
studies demonstrated a significant independent effect of phos￾phorus in PTH synthesis/secretion. Our studies have also dem￾onstrated an effect of phosphorus on parathyroid cell growth.
Similar results were reported recently by Yi et al. (21) and
Naveh-Many et al. (22). In addition, our studies demonstrated
in vitro a direct effect of phosphorus on PTH synthesis/secre￾tion. This effect seems to be posttranscriptional. This finding
has important clinical implications. We and others (23) have
observed in dialysis patients that the control of secondary hy￾perparathyroidism by 1,25-(OH)2D3
 is lost when the patients
develop hyperphosphatemia. It is possible that persistent hy￾perphosphatemia in dialysis patients increases the rate of para￾thyroid cell growth. In view of the studies of Fukuda et al. (24)
which demonstrated that the larger the parathyroid glands the
lower the number of vitamin D receptors and the recent obser￾vations of Arnold et al. (25) of monoclonal transformation in
hyperplastic parathyroid glands from patients with severe sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphatemia, our re￾sults emphasize the critical need to control phosphorus in ure￾mic patients.
Also, it is not known currently how phosphorus induces
PTH synthesis or parathyroid gland hyperplasia. We should
emphasize that the conditions of our experiments are not iden￾tical to those seen in clinical uremia where exposure to high
phosphate for many years may affect calcium and vitamin D
metabolism. Denda et al. (26) demonstrated that the effect of
phosphorus on parathyroid cell growth in uremic rats is very
rapid; 90% of the growth observed after 2 mo of renal failure
occurs in the first 3 d. Potentially, the participation of proto￾oncogenes like c-fos, c-jun, and PRAD-1 (27–29) may play a
role in the growth of the parathyroid glands. Also, it is not yet
known how phosphorus increases PTH synthesis in the para￾thyroid glands and enhances the rate of PTH secretion. This
effect is not acute and, therefore, apparently does not occur di￾rectly through the signaling pathway for calcium. It may,
through a slower process, alter the responsiveness to calcium.
These possibilities are under investigation.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that dietary phospho￾rus restriction not only prevents secondary hyperparathyroid￾ism independent of serum ICa and 1,25-(OH)2D3
 but prevents
parathyroid cell growth. Moreover, we also have demon￾strated for the first time a direct action of phosphorus in vitro
to increase the rate of PTH synthesis. The effect seems to be
posttranscriptional. Further studies at the molecular level are
necessary to precisely define the mechanism of action of phos￾phorus in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism
in chronic renal failure.
