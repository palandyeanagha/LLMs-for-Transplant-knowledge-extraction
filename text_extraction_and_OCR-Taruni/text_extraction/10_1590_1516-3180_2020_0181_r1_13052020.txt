INTRODUCTION 
The first case of COVID-19 (new type of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) in Turkey was identified 
on March 11, 2020, which was also the date on which the World Health Organization declared 
the outbreak to be a pandemic.1-3 As COVID-19 has spread around the world and across 
Turkey, the hospitals that have been used to treat the disease have become locations where 
there is a high risk of infection.4,5 
Between this first case in Turkey on March 11, 2020, and a survey on April 2, 2020, a further 
18,135 cases were identified. Approximately 60% of these cases were seen in the city of Istanbul 
where our hospital is located.6,7 Thus, Istanbul alone accounts for more than half of all patients 
among the 81 cities of this country. Moreover, the hospital in which we work was the first and 
is now one of the four officially declared pandemic hospitals in the city. The intensity of patient 
demand is higher around these hospitals, which gave us a responsibility to report our data because 
of the high reliability of our results.7
With the increasing incidence rate of the disease in our country, the number of patients 
diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 infection entering our emergency ser￾vice and inpatient services has also rapidly increased. It has therefore been recommended 
that elective surgeries should be postponed wherever possible, in regions to which the pan￾demic has spread.8,9
However, this is not possible with emergency surgeries, and so it has become necessary to 
carry out such surgeries while taking the maximum of precautions. Healthcare professionals are 
at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 and its infection, given their involvement in treat￾ment of this disease. This has brought to light the risk that the healthcare workforce for fighting

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening healthcare systems and hospital operations on a 
global scale. Treatment algorithms have changed in general surgery clinics, as in other medical disciplines 
providing emergency services, with greater changes seen especially in pandemic hospitals. 
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the follow-up of patients undergoing emergency surgery in our hospital during 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary-level public hospital. 
METHODS: The emergency surgeries carried out between March 11 and April 2, 2020, in the general 
surgery clinic of a tertiary-care hospital that has also taken on the functions of a pandemic hospital, were 
retrospectively examined.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were included, among whom 20 were discharged without event, one 
remained in the surgical intensive care unit, two are under follow-up by the surgery service and two died. 
Upon developing postoperative fever and shortness of breath, two patients underwent thoracic comput￾ed tomography (CT), although no characteristics indicating COVID-19 were found. The discharged pa￾tients had no COVID-19 positivity at follow-up. 
CONCLUSION: The data that we obtained were not surgical results from patients with COVID-19 infection. 
They were the results from emergency surgeries on patients who were not infected with COVID-19 but 
were in a hospital largely dealing with the pandemic. Analysis on the cases in this study showed that both 
the patients with emergency surgery and the patients with COVİD infection were successfully treated, 
without influencing each other, through appropriate isolation measures, although managed in the same 
hospital. In addition, these successful results were supported by 14-day follow-up after discharge.

against the COVID-19 pandemic may become diminished through 
illness. Given the way in which this disease has spread and affected 
healthcare systems around the world, it can be understood that 
hospitals must provide services for individuals who have been diag￾nosed with or are suspected of having COVID-19 infection, while 
also treating emergency surgery patients. After our institution was 
declared a pandemic hospital, emergency surgeries continued to 
be performed there, in a controlled manner. The COVID-19 pan￾demic is affecting healthcare systems and treatment approaches 
through its new and unknown features. 
OBJECTIVE 
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the follow-up of patients 
who underwent emergency surgery in our hospital during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS
This study consisted of a cross-sectional evaluation of the emer￾gency surgeries performed in the general surgery clinic of a ter￾tiary- care hospital between March 11, 2020, when the first offi￾cial COVID-19 case in Turkey was reported, and April 2, 2020. 
Elective and semi-elective surgeries were excluded from this 
study. The parameters examined included the patients’ demo￾graphic data, comorbidities, indications for surgery, preoper￾ative patient assessment environment, preoperative imaging 
methods, infection parameters, surgical procedures, anesthetic 
procedures, postoperative intensive care requirement, length of 
hospital stay, status of postoperative COVID-19 suspicion and 
postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. All patients were 
evaluated with regard to whether there was any suspicion of or a 
diagnosis of COVID-19 before they were admitted to the hospi￾tal and after discharge,
Our approaches in the process of adaptation to the pandemic
Pursuant to a decision by the COVID-19 Scientific Advisory 
Board at the start of the outbreak, all suspected COVID-19 cases 
were evaluated in isolated areas, and were diagnosed and treated 
in separate areas within the emergency service. Thus, patients 
presenting for surgery at the emergency service were considered 
to have been prevented from coming into contact with suspected 
COVID-19 patients.8
The initial examinations on the surgical patients were made 
using personal protective equipment, initially using masks and 
gloves. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly 
increased, all surgical patients were assumed to have contracted 
this disease, and N95 or filtering facepiece (FFP) masks, protec￾tive googles and protective gowns started to be used as routine. 
Patients who were scheduled for surgery and admitted to the ser￾vice were taken into individual rooms. They were then moved to 
the operating room wearing a mask, and without spending any 
time in the preoperative room. 
In order to avoid bringing the patient into contact with too 
many people prior to anesthesia, the anesthesia care team consisted 
only of an anesthesiologist and an anesthetic technician. Under the 
assumption that the patient was COVID-19 positive, the anesthetic 
procedures were carried out with the operative wearing an N95 
protective mask with a surgical mask over it, a surgical box gown 
and protective googles. 
Intubations were made by specialist physicians using a video￾laryngoscope, with rapid induction and without mask ventilation. 
Complete nasal oxygenation was ensured. During wakening, oxy￾gen was administered through a nasal cannula in order to avoid 
post-extubation masking. Recovery and wakening occurred in the 
operating room when possible, and the patient was transferred 
directly to the surgical service without entering the postoperative 
room. Patients requiring intensive care were transferred to the 
intensive care negative-pressure isolation room, accompanied by 
the anesthesiologist, via a different corridor. The same personal 
protective equipment was used for patients receiving spinal anes￾thesia. The surgical team used liquid-tight gowns, surgical masks 
over N95, protective googles and gloves (double), as personal pro￾tective equipment. 
Postoperative visits to patients were conducted with a mini￾mum of personnel (one physician and one nurse), wearing N95 
masks and a surgical box gown upon each entry to and exit from 
the room, and using hand disinfectant. At the time of discharge, the 
patients were given the recommendation that they should adhere 
to a 14-day isolation period. On the 14th day after discharge, these 
patients were called by phone, to gain information.
Ethical approval
Board of ethics approval for this study was obtained from the eth￾ics commission of the Health Sciences University, Haseki Training 
and Research Hospital, under approval number 40-2020, dated 
April 17, 2020.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated, including means, standard 
deviations, medians, minimums, maximums, frequencies and 
ratios. The SPSS 22.0 software was used for the analyses.
RESULTS
This study included a total of 25 patients, of whom nine were 
male and 16 were female, with a mean age of 50 years. The nine 
male patients all had comorbidities. Table 1 shows the patients’ 
comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, preoperative imag￾ing, anesthetic procedure, duration of operation, length of hos￾pital stay, postoperative complications and mortality. Among all

the patients, six of them had more than one comorbidity, and 
none presented any suspicion of preoperative COVID-19 or had 
any history of contact. 
Upon developing postoperative fever and shortness of breath, 
two patients underwent a thoracic computed tomography (CT), 
which did not reveal any imaging suggestive of COVID-19. 
Material was sent for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
tests and the results were negative. These two patients were dis￾charged upon regression of their fever and cough.
Mortality occurred in the cases of two other patients who had 
undergone operations due to ischemia. During the 14-day follow-up 
on the patients who had been discharged, there was no suspicion 
of COVID-19 and findings of the disease. 
Table 2 shows the operations and indications of the patients. 
The most common cause of admission was acute appendicitis. 
Three patients were operated on to treat findings of diffuse peri￾tonitis due to leakage of an anastomosis. Three patients were 
operated on due to mesenteric ischemia because of late admis￾sion with acute abdominal and necrotic findings. Two patients 
were operated on to treat rectal malignancies due to mechanical 
colon obstruction. In one patient, bleeding did not stop despite 
endoscopic intervention to treat upper gastrointestinal system 
bleeding, and hemodynamic deterioration was observed. One 
patient was operated on to treat mechanical intestinal obstruction 
due to adhesions, since there was no intestinal passage despite 
follow-up for 72 hours. In one patient, intestinal evisceration 
occurred during postoperative mobilization. In one patient, 
retraction of the intestinal stoma into the abdomen occurred on 
the postoperative third day. In one patient who had undergone 
an inguinal hernia repair because of anticoagulant usage, wide￾spread postoperative hematoma and active blood leakage was 
observed. One patient was operated on due to abundant hem￾orrhage following failure of endoscopic gastrostomy revision, by 
means of endoscopic therapeutic intervention. 
All the patients were operated on under emergency condi￾tions. None of the patients presented suspected COVID or any 
diagnostic history before hospital admission, and none of these 
patients had any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 over the 14-day 
follow-up after discharge.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, the changes in approaches to general surgery 
and emergency practices resulting from the COVID-19 pan￾demic were examined. The pandemic continues to spread rap￾idly, and has affected all healthcare service units and operations 
around the world, and Turkey has not been an exception. 
We demonstrated that necessary surgeries can still be performed 
in COVID-19 pandemic hospitals if the measures and precautions 
required are taken. Despite research into the epidemiology, patho￾physiology, treatment and practices relating to patients infected with

COVID-19, and the respective effects on public health, algorithms 
for surgical treatment on individuals with a suspicion or diagnosis 
of COVID-19 infection have been deemed of secondary impor￾tance.9
 Earlier in the pandemic, anesthesiologists published vari￾ous recommendations for the equipment and protection that was 
required to protect themselves during intubation.8,11,12 Subsequently, 
recommended approaches to surgery were suggested for patients 
with a suspicion or diagnosis of COVID-19.3,5,10
Although a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients are 
asymptomatic, it is an infectious disease. Therefore, all our sur￾gical patients in our pandemic hospital were approached under 
the assumption that they were positive, from the earliest days. 
Since the virus is mainly transmitted through droplets, it is accepted 
that the virus will remain on contact surfaces for hours, or even 
days, as a potential source of infection through transmission by 
contact.11 This constitutes a risk for healthcare professionals, who 
may come into contact with these contaminated surfaces, thus 
transmitting the virus to themselves or others.13 All surfaces were 
disinfected, and efforts were made to leave as much time as possi￾ble between two operations. Both the anesthesia care team and the 
surgical team tried to have the minimum number of staff present 
in the room during induction of anesthesia. 
The use of laparoscopy in emergency surgery on patients sus￾pected of or diagnosed with COVID-19 is a matter of controversy, 
given that there is still no clear information in this regard. Yu et al.14
reported that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through droplets and contact, 
although fecal-oral and aerosol transmissions cannot be ignored. They 
therefore stated that laparoscopic surgeries could be performed on 
colon cancer patients infected with COVID-19, although there would 
be a need for good management of laparoscopic gases. Likewise, 
Morris et al.15 suggested that the laparoscopic approach could be 
used for gynecological cases, and that the risk of COVID-19 had 
yet to be proven. In the present study, seven patients underwent 
laparoscopic appendectomy and one patient underwent diagnostic 
laparoscopy with a diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia. No problems 
were encountered during the postoperative follow-up on the seven 
patients. Considering that use of laparoscopy reduces the length of 
hospital stay, we conclude that its use should be preferred in emer￾gency surgery when performed by experienced surgeons. 
Some studies have recommended follow-up at home using 
antibiotics, with communication via telephone or other means, 
for cases of non-complicated acute appendicitis.16 Such patients, 
however, were scheduled for surgery, even though there was no 
perforation, considering that there might not have been sufficient 
ways means of communication and access in the pandemic area, 
with poor access to healthcare facilities. A total of ten patients 
who underwent appendectomy were discharged without event. 
In a review by Di Saverio et al.,3
 it was recommended that 
all patients who were to undergo surgery should be tested for 
COVID-19. Such tests were not requested in the earliest of our cases, 
given that the test results would not be available immediately, and 
the surgical decision would be unaffected anyway. With increas￾ing numbers of COVID-19-positive patients and tests (PCR), we 
started to seek tests in new cases, as the routine. In a similar vein, 
no thoracic CT was requested in the earliest days, but came to be 
sought even if the patient was asymptomatic, in line with the lat￾est recommendations.5
 Thoracic CT was requested in the cases of 
11 patients, along with abdominal CT (44%).
Protective measures were also taken in relation to cases operated 
on previously in our hospital that were admitted for surgery due to 
complications during the process. Such patients were considered 
to be at risk because of their contact with visitors and healthcare 
personnel. Furthermore, two patients with rectal tumors under￾went emergency surgery for a temporary protective loop colostomy. 
Given that all elective surgery and diagnostic endoscopy pro￾cedures have been postponed because of the extended duration 
of the pandemic, there is growing concern about the increasing 
the frequency of presentations to the emergency services with a 
clinical picture of ileus due to colon and rectal tumors. The lim￾itations of the present study are the limited number of patients, 
the single-center design, the lack of randomization and the retro￾spective nature of the study.
CONCLUSION
We believe that the risk of dissemination of COVID-19 will be 
reduced through isolating the emergency surgery services from 
the pandemic services, by means of using personal protective 
equipment, carrying out preoperative abdominal CT simulta￾neously with thoracic CT (when required) and ensuring the 
minimum of contact between healthcare staff and the patient. 
The data that we obtained were not surgical results from patients 
with COVID-19 infection. They were the results from emergency 
surgeries on patients who were not infected with COVID-19 but 
were in a hospital largely dealing with the pandemic. Analysis on 
the cases in this study showed that both the patients with emer￾gency surgery and patients with COVİD infection were success￾fully treated, without influencing each other, through appropri￾ate isolation measures, although managed in the same hospital. 
In  addition, these successful results were supported by 14-day 
follow-up after discharge.
