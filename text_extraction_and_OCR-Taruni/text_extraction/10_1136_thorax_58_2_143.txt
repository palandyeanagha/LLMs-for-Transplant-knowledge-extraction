Abstract
Background: High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has an
important diagnostic role in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP).
We hypothesised that the HRCT appearance would have an impact
on survival in patients with IIP.
Methods: HRCT scans from patients with histological usual
interstitial pneumonia (UIP; n=73) or histological non-specific
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n=23) were characterised as definite
UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate, probable NSIP, or definite NSIP.
Cox regression analysis examined the relationships between
histopathological and radiological diagnoses and mortality,
controlling for patient age, sex, and smoking status.
Results: All 27 patients with definite or probable UIP on HRCT had
histological UIP; 18 of 44 patients with probable or definite NSIP on
HRCT had histological NSIP. Patients with HRCT diagnosed definite
or probable UIP had a shorter survival than those with
indeterminate CT (hazards ratio (HR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.58;


median survival 2.08 v 5.76 years) or HRCT diagnosed definite or
probable NSIP (HR 3.47, 95% CI 1.58 to 7.63; median survival 2.08
v 5.81 years). Patients with histological UIP with no HRCT
diagnosis of probable or definite UIP fared better than patients with
histological UIP and an HRCT diagnosis of definite or probable UIP
(HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.98; median survival 5.76 v 2.08 years)
and worse than those with a histological diagnosis of NSIP (HR
5.42, 95% CI 1.25 to 23.5; median survival 5.76 v >9 years).
Conclusions: Patients with a typical HRCT appearance of UIP
experience the highest mortality. A surgical lung biopsy is indicated
for patients without an HRCT appearance of UIP to differentiate
between histological UIP and NSIP.
