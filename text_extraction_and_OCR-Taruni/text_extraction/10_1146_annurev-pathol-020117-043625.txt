Abstract
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a life-threatening disorder charac￾terized by unbridled activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer
(NK) cells, and macrophages resulting in hypercytokinemia and immune￾mediated injury of multiple organ systems. It is seen in both children and
adults and is recognized as primary (driven by underlying genetic muta￾tions that abolish critical proteins required for normal function of cytotoxic
T cells and NK cells) or secondary (resulting from a malignant, infectious,
or autoimmune stimulus without an identifiable underlying genetic trig￾ger). Clinical and laboratory manifestations include fever, splenomegaly,
neurologic dysfunction, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, cytopenias, hyper￾triglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, hemophagocytosis, and diminished NK
cell activity. It is treated with immune suppressants, etoposide, and allo￾geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; more than 50% of children
who undergo transplant survive, but adults have quite poor outcomes even
with aggressive management. Newer agents directed at subduing the uncon￾trolled immune response in a targeted fashion offer promise in this highly
morbid disease.

INTRODUCTION
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome charac￾terized by an unchecked and persistent activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer
(NK) cells. Failure to control the immune response leads to increased secretion of inflamma￾tory cytokines and macrophage activation, causing systemic inflammatory symptoms and signs.
The magnitude of pathologic inflammation, which produces potentially life-threatening immune￾mediated injury of multiple organs, distinguishes it from other inflammatory disorders. Clinically,
HLH presents a diagnostic challenge because there is no one pathognomonic clinical manifestation
or laboratory finding and signs are often nonspecific. Manifestations, findings, or signs may vari￾ably include fever, organomegaly (including lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly),
liver injury, consumptive coagulopathy, hypertriglyceridemia, cytopenias, neurologic dysfunction,
dermatologic abnormalities, and elevations of acute phase reactants (notably serum ferritin) that
may be striking in magnitude. HLH is often classified as primary or familial (occurring in the
presence of an underlying predisposing genetic defect in immune function) or as secondary or
reactive (occurring in the absence of an underlying predisposing defect, typically in the setting
of an infectious, malignant, or autoimmune trigger). The disorder may occur secondary to spe￾cific (and maladaptive) interactions within the underlying immune system of the host when faced
with an immune challenge, such that an impaired host immune system provides an overactive
but ineffective response to the inciting challenge. Because the inciting challenge is not adequately
eliminated by the host immune response, satisfactory removal of the immunologic stimulus is
not achieved and the immune system does not undergo physiologic downregulation, which in￾stead initiates a deleterious cycle of amplified cytokine release and intensified immune activation.
Treatment is directed at breaking this vicious cycle and downmodulating the immune response
with myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive therapies, which may be challenging in patients
who often have multi-organ system failure at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, a search for any
underlying trigger, and proper management of that stimulus, is critical (1).
HLH, initially named histiocytic medullary reticulosis, was first reported in the literature in
1939 by Scott & Robb-Smith (2), who described a child as having a neoplastic histiocytic disorder.
The disorder was first recognized as familial by Farquhar & Claireaux (3) in 1952. For most of the
nearly 80 years that HLH has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity, it has been considered
to be a hereditary disorder of children. We now understand that patients of any age may develop
HLH and that the disease is most often triggered by a combination of underlying genetics and
acquired exposures. Indeed, adults now comprise approximately 40% of HLH cases (4).
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Dysregulation of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, Natural Killer Cells,
and Macrophages
Under normal physiologic circumstances, upon encountering a virally infected cell or tumor cell,
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells release cytolytic granules containing perforin (a protein that
forms pores in the target cell, facilitating the entrance of granzymes and destabilizing the mem￾brane of the target cell) and granzymes (proteins involved in triggering apoptosis in the target
cell) that promote cytolytic destruction of the target cell. In order for this process to proceed nor￾mally, perforin and granzymes must be structurally normal and properly trafficked within the cell
and packaged into granules. These granules must then undergo exocytosis into the immunologic
synapse between the cytotoxic cell and its target, after which the contents of the granules must en￾ter the target cell. Disruption of this process via genetic mutations predisposes to the development

of primary, or familial, HLH. Under normal circumstances, perforin and granzymes contribute
to the destruction of target cells and elimination of the immune-activating stimulus; this results
in reduced antigen stimulation of the cytotoxic immune cells and their eventual apoptosis. This
physiologic downregulation, termed activation-induced cell death, is critical for control of the
immune response. The inability to clear the antigenic stimulus results in persistence and amplifi￾cation of the immune response. Proinflammatory cytokines released by the activated immune cells
result in high levels of macrophage activation with resultant hemophagocytosis, tissue damage,
organ failure, and the other inflammatory manifestations of the syndrome (5).
Secondary or acquired HLH may result from a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune stimulus
in the absence of an identifiable underlying genetic trigger. Different patterns of T lymphocyte
activation and differentiation have been observed in secondary HLH patients as opposed to those
with primary HLH, which suggests possible underlying differences in the pathogenesis of these
two entities (6). Lymphomas that result in HLH have been shown to produce proinflammatory
cytokines that provide the initial and enduring stimulus for activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes
and NK cells as the trigger for the syndrome (7). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common
infectious trigger for both primary and secondary HLH. EBV, which normally infects B lym￾phocytes, can result in EBV-associated HLH via infection of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
This infection drives their uncontrolled activation and aberrant activity (8). Macrophage activa￾tion syndrome (MAS) is a subtype of HLH in which the syndrome develops in the background
of autoimmune disease. A spectrum of underlying immune dysfunction is thought to predispose
patients with certain systemic autoimmune disorders to the development of HLH, although it is
recognized that some patients may have acquired functional abnormalities in perforin-mediated
cytolysis by NK cells (9). Secondary HLH has been seen following allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients who have immune activation secondary to tissue￾damaging cytotoxic conditioning agents and high-level cytokine production from proliferating
engrafting hematopoietic cells. These patients are also subject to reactivation of latent viruses in
the setting of significant immunologic dysfunction (10). These triggers of secondary HLH are the
most common and most important; additional triggers for secondary HLH have been proposed
in the literature.
Dramatic Elevations in Cytokine Levels
Hypercytokinemia was identified relatively early in the understanding of HLH pathophysiology.
A 1989 study found significant elevations in levels of the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R)
in patients with HLH; these elevations were in line with levels seen in lymphoid neoplasms and
resolved with clinical improvement (11), which led to the designation of sIL2R as a marker for
disease activity (12). A 1991 study examining interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
and IL-6 levels in nine children with familial HLH found elevated levels of IFN-γ (seven out of
seven children), TNF (six out of six), and IL-6 (two out of six) (13).
Patients with HLH have dramatically elevated levels of numerous serum proinflammatory
cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-16, IL-18, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (14, 15), and
higher measured cytokine levels have been correlated with poorer outcomes (14). Elevated levels
of anti-inflammatory cytokines have also been observed in HLH, particularly of IL-10, suggesting
that patients do retain a mechanism (although clearly an inadequate one) to suppress activation of
T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (16, 17). Of the cytokines dramatically elevated in
HLH, IFN-γ may be especially noteworthy. High levels of IFN-γ result in macrophage activation
and subsequent increased production of other proinflammatory cytokines. In a perforin-deficient
mouse model, in which HLH was induced via infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,

the combination of CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ was shown to be uniquely required for the HLH
phenotype (18), supporting IFN-γ inhibition as a potential target for therapy of HLH (described
in the section titled “Treatment and Prognosis of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis”).
CLASSIFICATION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HEMOPHAGOCYTIC
LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS
Classification
HLH is designated as a subset of the broader family of histiocytoses and neoplasms of the
macrophage-dendritic cell lineages. This family includes the L (Langerhans-related) group, the C
(cutaneous and mucocutaneous histiocytoses) group, the M (malignant histiocytoses) group, the R
(Rosai-Dorfman disease) group, and the H (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage
activation syndrome) group. A simplified schema of the most updated (2016) classification of the
H group is presented in Table 1 (19).
Most children with primary HLH have identifiable genetic defects inherited in Mendelian
fashion as either homozygous or compound heterozygous lesions. These genes are nearly all null
mutations that abolish critical proteins required for normal function of cytotoxic T cells and NK
cells. Adult HLH is generally termed secondary HLH that arises because of external triggers. More
recent analysis has demonstrated that about 15% of patients with adult HLH harbor mutations in
familial HLH genes that may serve as predisposing alleles for the development of HLH, though
still in response to typical triggers (20). These hypomorphic alleles are considered to be host
factors that may impart a baseline risk for the development of HLH but that do not usually
cause disease; some of these alleles occur in 5–10% of the population, so their contribution to
the development of HLH may be small. This is in contrast to those mutations that lead to near
universal occurrence of HLH in infancy or early childhood and tend to result in complete loss of
protein function; complete loss of perforin is one example (21). An intermediate between these two
extremes involves missense mutations that result in residual protein function. Missense mutations
are found in primary HLH patients and correlate with later onset of disease, though the vast
majority still present by adolescence (22).
Epidemiology
Epidemiologic data on HLH are derived primarily from large cohorts on whom retrospective
analyses have been published in the literature. A retrospective series from a large academic hospital
in Texas suggested a prevalence of HLH in Texas of 1 in 100,000 children, with a median age at
diagnosis of 1.8 years (23). The incidence of HLH in children is estimated at 1 to 225 per 300,000
live births and appears to vary by geographic region (24). A retrospective series from Sweden
analyzing data collected from 1971 to 1986 suggested an incidence of 1.2 per 1,000,000 children
yearly, though in retrospect this number may reflect substantial underdiagnosis that occurred
prior to more widespread understanding about the syndrome (25).
Epidemiologic data are sparser in adults. A review of multiple patient cohorts suggests an
average age at presentation of approximately 50 years when the disorder occurs in adulthood (4,
26). Although the incidence of HLH in adults is not precisely known, it has been estimated to
account for as many as 1 out of every 2,000 adult admissions at tertiary medical centers (27). The
existence of significantly fewer published cohorts of adult patients over a shorter time span has
important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Whereas the clinical

used diagnostic criteria in adults, the HLH-2004 criteria (described in detail in the section titled
“Diagnosis of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis”), were derived from studies in children (28).
Moreover, no prospective studies on first-line therapy for HLH in adults exist, and consequently,
pediatric data are usually extrapolated to guide therapeutic decision making in adult patients.

It is not clear whether there is a racial or ethnic predilection for HLH. Most series in the
literature are retrospective, reflecting the experience of a single center or a collection of regional
centers; therefore, the racial and ethnic makeup of the patients within them tends to approximate
what would be expected from the geographic location of the study. For example, in one US study of
68 adult patients with HLH from three large academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts,
65% of patients were white, 13% black, 10% Asian, and 7% Hispanic (29). In contrast, 43% of
HLH patients were Latino in a large series of pediatric patients from a large hospital in Texas
(23). It has been demonstrated, however, that certain subtypes of familial HLH are more common
in certain ethnic or national groups (30). The sex ratio in children appears to be close to 1:1 (25).
In adults, there may be a slight male predominance (4); in the previously mentioned Boston series,
63% of patients were male (29). In contrast, MAS may be slightly more common in females (31),
probably reflecting the increased prevalence in women of associated autoimmune disease.

of familial HLH, the associated immunodeficiency syndromes, and the mutations predisposing
to EBV-driven disease (1). Cases have been published of patients with heterozygous mutations
in two different HLH-associated genes, resulting in a possible synergistic risk of development of
HLH (32).
Five types of familial HLH have been identified and described. Familial HLH type 1 is due to
a genetic abnormality in the 9q21 locus on chromosome 9, although the specific causative gene
has yet to be identified (33). Familial HLH type 2 results from mutations in PRF1, which codes
for the perforin protein. This protein is normally contained within cytolytic granules and results
in pore formation in the target cell membrane, facilitating entrance of other cytolytic proteins and
promoting osmotic lysis of the cell (34). Familial HLH type 3 results from mutations in UNC13D,
which codes for the protein Munc-13-4. This protein is normally involved in the regulation of
cytolytic granule maturation and exocytosis (35). Familial HLH type 4 results from mutations in
STX11, which codes for syntaxin 11, a protein responsible for normal transport and exocytosis of
cytolytic granules (36). Familial HLH type 5 results from mutations in STXBP2, which codes for
syntaxin-binding protein 2; this protein normally binds to syntaxin 11 and promotes membrane
fusion of and release of cytolytic granules (37). Patients with mutations in these genes that result
in complete loss of protein function develop primary HLH in childhood.
Numerous genotype-phenotype studies of patients with familial HLH have been performed
to arrive at these conclusions. In one such study, the phenotype of 37 patients with biallelic
STXBP2 mutations was analyzed. The 13 patients with exon 15 splice site mutations in STXBP2
developed clinical manifestations of HLH much later than those with other mutations (median age
of 4.1 years for exon 15 splice site mutations and 2 months for other mutations) (38). In another
study of 124 patients with biallelic PRF1 mutations, later disease onset and residual cytotoxic
function were found in patients with at least one missense mutation (39). In 84 patients with
biallelic UNC13D mutations, patients with two disruptive mutations (defined as indels, deletions,
nonsense mutations, and splice errors) were more likely to have disease onset at a younger age
than those with two missense mutations (40).
Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Associated
Acquired Disorders
Most cases of HLH in adults for which a clear trigger may be identified are associated with
infection (typically herpesviruses), malignancy, or autoimmune disease. Other less common eti￾ologies include medication exposures, pregnancy, post–allogeneic HSCT, and post-solid organ
transplantation (41).
Infectious agents. Infection is usually associated with HLH and is the most common precipitant
for HLH in children with primary HLH. Viral infection, either primary infection or viral reactiva￾tion, is a known trigger for HLH, especially in an immunosuppressed host. DNA viruses from the
family Herpesviridae are the most frequent viral agents, with EBV as the most commonly implicated
infectious agent overall, resulting in disease via proliferation and hyperactivation of EBV-infected
T lymphocytes (8). Other human herpesviruses reported to trigger HLH include cytomegalovirus
(42), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (43, 44), varicella-zoster virus (45), roseolovirus (46), and
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (47). Beyond the herpesviruses, numerous other DNA
and RNA viruses across a broad spectrum of viral families have been reported to trigger HLH.
In particular, numerous etiologic agents of the viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes have been
associated, including dengue virus (48), Ebola virus (49), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
virus (50). Indeed, because of the considerable overlap in clinical manifestations between the
viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes and HLH, some authors have postulated that the clinical

PM13CH02-Al-Samkari ARI 18 December 2017 21:39
manifestations of viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes due to these viruses may actually represent
a reactive HLH (51).
Several nonviral pathogens have been associated with the disease. Among the bacteria, cases
describing HLH in association with Rickettsia (52) and Mycobacterium (53) are particularly nu￾merous; some case studies implicate a host of other bacteria as well (54–56). The most common
fungal pathogen associated with HLH is the endemic dimorphic fungus Histoplasma (57). The
most common parasites implicated include Plasmodium, Leishmania, and Babesia (58–60).
The overall contribution of infection in the pathogenesis of HLH may be best illustrated via
examination of several large case series in the literature. In a large retrospective multicenter US
case series of 68 adults with HLH as defined by the HLH-2004 criteria, 22 (33%) of the patients
were found to have an infectious trigger for their disease, most commonly EBV (6 patients) and
cytomegalovirus (6 patients); other less common triggers in the series included varicella-zoster
virus, human immunodeficiency virus, adenovirus, influenza A, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus,
roseolovirus, Helicobacter pylori, Morganella spp., Staphylococcus epidemidis, Klebsiella spp., Clostridium
difficile, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Aspergillusspp., and Babesia microti (29).
In a published study of 96 adult patients with HLH, 30 (31%) were associated with infection. Of
these 30 patients, 46% had bacterial infections, 41% had viral infections, and 13% had fungal
infections (61). In a series of 30 patients receiving biologic agents for autoimmune disease or
hematologic malignancy, 20 patients had suspected infectious triggers of HLH (62).
Malignancy. Malignancies are the most common trigger for the development of HLH in adults
(approximately 45% of cases), although they are a minor cause in children (approximately 8%
of cases) (20). These patients may develop HLH as a result of immune activation by neoplastic
cells or by loss of inhibitory immune function from disease or treatment-induced bone marrow
dysfunction (41). Patients with malignancy, particularly hematologic malignancy, present with
a baseline level of immune dysfunction secondary to the cancer, and this dysfunction is often
worsened via institution of antineoplastic therapy.
Hematologic malignancies are much more common triggers than solid tumors, and both lym￾phoid and myeloid neoplasms have been associated with the development of HLH. Lymphoma
is the most common neoplastic trigger for HLH, with T and NK cell lymphomas most common.
In a large retrospective multicenter US case series of 68 adults with HLH, 33 patients (49%)
had an underlying neoplasm. Nine patients had a myeloid neoplasm (acute myeloid leukemia,
chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, or myelodysplastic syndrome); 22 had a lymphoid
neoplasm (most commonly Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, peripheral T
cell lymphoma, NK/T cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia); and two patients had a
solid tumor (prostate cancer or insulinoma) (29). In a retrospective multicenter European series
of 29 children with malignancy-associated HLH, 21 patients developed HLH in the context of
their neoplasm prior to treatment with chemotherapy; six of these patients also had a clear infec￾tious trigger (EBV in five of the six cases). Eight patients developed HLH during chemotherapy,
of whom seven had clear infectious triggers. Every patient had a hematologic malignancy, with
T cell neoplasms accounting for most cases (63).
Autoimmune disorders (macrophage activation syndrome). Initially described in 1985 in a
patient with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), secondary HLH that occurs in the setting
of rheumatologic disease is termed MAS (64). It is most commonly seen in patients with sJIA, adult￾onset Still disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Kawasaki disease, but has been described
as occurring secondary to numerous rheumatologic conditions in published case reports (31).

Approximately 30–40% of sJIA patients develop some degree of MAS, of which approximately
one-third is clinically overt (31, 65). A detailed discussion of MAS is beyond the scope of this
review; the reader is directed to a recent comprehensive review by Ravelli and colleagues (31) for
more regarding this entity.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF HEMOPHAGOCYTIC
LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS
Clinical Characteristics
Patients with HLH frequently present with a constellation of signs and symptoms that include
some combination of fever, organomegaly (lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly),
neurologic dysfunction (such as encephalitis, seizures, or coma), edema, dermatologic manifesta￾tions, and stigmata of liver dysfunction or coagulopathy (such as jaundice or bruising). Patients
are often critically ill and rapidly progress toward a septic shock–like clinical picture. The HLH￾2004 criteria include several of these findings as diagnostic criteria. Because HLH was originally
characterized as a pediatric illness, the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria and much of the litera￾ture concerning the clinical presentation of the syndrome are based on pediatric HLH. We now
understand that some differences exist in the presentation of HLH between pediatric and adult
populations. For example, hepatomegaly occurs in 95% of children but only 18–67% of adults
(66). Table 3 summarizes the clinical characteristics of HLH in adults and children, collected
from several large HLH patient cohorts.
Neurologic manifestations attributable to HLH are common in pediatric patients. A pediatric
neuropathologic study in 1984 revealed infiltration of the meninges by lymphocytes and histio￾cytes as well as diffuse proliferation of histiocytes within the brain parenchyma (67). Neurologic
manifestations are more common in children and vary from peripheral neuropathies or focal
neurologic deficits to encephalopathic changes, seizure, or even coma (68). Analyses may find

that patients have a pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and variable, nonspecific findings on
magnetic resource imaging may be noted, including leptomeningeal enhancement, white matter
lesions, and evidence of stroke (69). Retrospective studies have suggested a worse prognosis in
patients with neurologic involvement (68).
Dermatologic manifestations may also be seen and are varied. Thrombocytopenia may result in
petechiae, purpura, or ecchymoses.Widespread systemic inflammation may result in erythematous
maculopapular rashes or widespread erythroderma (70, 71).
Laboratory Characteristics
Numerous laboratory and pathologic abnormalities are associated with HLH, but unfortunately
none are pathognomonic. Cytopenias (usually of two or three cell lines), hypertriglyceridemia,
hypofibrinogenemia, hyperferritinemia, elevated levels of the sIL2rα chain (CD25), reduced NK
cell function, abnormal liver function testing, and hemophagocytosis may be seen in any combi￾nation, along with several other less common abnormalities. Table 4 summarizes the laboratory
characteristics of HLH in adults and children, collected from several large HLH patient cohorts.
Hemophagocytosis is the pathologic finding of engulfment of erythrocytes, platelets, or white
blood cells by macrophages, identified by the presence of whole blood cells or blood cell fragments
within macrophage cytoplasm (Figure 1). It may be seen on examination of bone marrow, spleen,
liver, or lymph node. Unfortunately, due to nomenclature, it may be incorrectly presumed that the
presence of hemophagocytosis on a biopsy specimen is required for diagnosis, or that its absence
rules out the disorder. Indeed, hemophagocytosis is found in a majority of cases of HLH and is
not considered sensitive or specific to the disorder (66). It is included in essentially all diagnostic
criteria for HLH.
Because HLH is a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by extreme elevations in proin￾flammatory cytokine levels, acute phase reactants are often elevated, sometimes to dramatic levels
(the exception to this is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which may be low due to hypofibrino￾genemia). The acute phase reactant most associated with HLH is the serum ferritin. It is thought
that extensive macrophage activation may be responsible for the significantly elevated levels that
are often seen, as the primary storage site for ferritin is within tissue macrophages (72). Therefore,
elevation in serum ferritin levels is a component in essentially all widely accepted clinical diag￾nostic criteria for HLH. Its utility as a diagnostic marker, however, varies between children and
adults. A 2008 retrospective study of children with HLH from Texas Children’s Hospital revealed
that elevation in serum ferritin levels above 10,000 μg/L is 90% sensitive and 98% specific for
pediatric HLH (73). A 2015 retrospective study of adults with HLH from multiple large academic
medical centers in Boston, however, revealed that dramatically elevated ferritin levels were neither
sensitive nor specific for HLH in adults (74). Ferritin levels of greater than 50,000 μg/L were seen
most frequently in patients with renal failure, liver injury, infection, and hematologic malignan￾cies, with only 19% of this group diagnosed with HLH. Not surprisingly, the majority of these
HLH patients also had concomitant renal failure or liver injury, and many had both. The authors
concluded that there was no ferritin value above which serum ferritin was specific for HLH in
adults. The negative predictive value of a normal serum ferritin level for HLH is felt to be high
in adult patients, however (41).
Elevated aminotransferase levels, although not part of the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, have
been shown to be present in >75% of both adults and children with HLH (51). Elevated levels
of aspartate aminotransferase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) are part of the HScore
diagnostic score for HLH (discussed below). All patterns of liver injury may be seen in HLH
(hepatocellular injury, cholestatic injury, or mixed injury patterns). Pathologic examination of

the liver in patients with HLH may show lymphocytic infiltration of portal triads as in other
causes of chronic active hepatitis (41). Coagulopathy is frequently seen in HLH, and its cause is
multifactorial, owing to thrombocytopenia, liver injury and impairment in synthetic func￾tion of coagulation factors, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The presence of
hypofibrinogenemia is one of the eight HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria.
Reduced NK cell activity may be seen in HLH as a reflection of an underlying immune defect
(75) and is one of the eight HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. It is typically measured via a radiolabeled
chromium release assay; release of cytotoxic granules (containing the radionuclide 51Cr) from NK

cells may be reduced in patients with HLH. The sensitivity and specificity of reduced NK cell
activity for the diagnosis of HLH appear to be much better in children with HLH than adults
(76). Due to the limited availability of the assay and its poor predictive value in adults, it is seldom
performed even in large academic centers; in an analysis of multiple large series from academic
medical centers, it was sent in only 8–15% of adult patients with HLH (66).
Elevated levels of sIL2Rα, also known as soluble CD25, are among the HLH-2004 diagnostic
criteria for the disorder. Dramatically elevated levels of CD25 appear to be relatively specific
for HLH (41), and a relatively high soluble CD25/ferritin ratio is useful in the differentiation of
lymphoma-associated HLH from so-called benign HLH (nonmalignant etiologies of HLH) (77).
Soluble CD163, the macrophage-specific scavenger receptor for native and chemically modified
hemoglobins, is elevated in disorders that result in a significant degree of macrophage activation,
such as HLH, but also malignancy, autoimmunity, and infection (78, 79). Levels tend to be much
higher in HLH than these other disorders, however. So although it is not specific for HLH, this
marker may be assayed to aid in diagnosis (41). This test is not routinely sent at the current time,
however, and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the test have not been well defined.
DIAGNOSIS OF HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS
HLH-2004 Diagnostic Criteria
Timely diagnosis of HLH is of special importance, as patients may be critically ill and delays
in diagnosis may result in poor outcomes. Moreover, high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and
cytotoxic chemotherapy are typically not administered for other conditions on the differential
diagnosis for the disorder, such as bacterial sepsis or life-threatening viral infection. Diagnosis is
based on clinical criteria, and no single diagnostic laboratory assay or pathognomonic clinical find￾ing exists that can establish a diagnosis. The most commonly used and widely accepted diagnostic
criteria for HLH are the HLH-2004 criteria from the Histiocyte Society:

These are the criteria (five of eight must be present) utilized for the diagnosis of HLH from
the currently ongoing prospective pediatric trial, HLH-2004, modified from the older HLH-94
diagnostic criteria (which required five out of five criteria for HLH diagnosis) (80). Additionally,
confirmation of a pathogenic genetic mutation of familial HLH may also be used to establish a
diagnosis of familial HLH. There is no consensus on the guidelines for the diagnosis of MAS.
Some investigators advocate for use of the HLH-2004 criteria (31), whereas others advocate for
specific diagnostic criteria for the MAS complicating sJIA (81).
HScore
A multicenter retrospective cohort of 312 patients judged by an expert panel to have (n = 162)
or to not have (n = 104) HLH, or in whom the diagnosis was not clear (n = 46), was used to
construct and validate a diagnostic score, dubbed the HScore (also referred to as the H-score by
some publications). This score was originally published in 2014. Nine criteria (the presence of
immunosuppression, fever, organomegaly; elevations in triglyceride levels, ferritin levels, aspartate
aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels, and fibrinogen levels; and the
presence of cytopenias and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirate) were evaluated for their
association with HLH, and logistic regression was used to calculate the weight of each criterion
to create a score between 0 and 337, with a higher score corresponding to a higher probability
of HLH. The creators of the score found an optimal threshold of 169, which corresponded to a
sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 86%, and accurately classified 90% of the patients in the
cohort (82).
The HScore has been compared with the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. A Belgian retro￾spective study analyzed the performance of the HScore in accurately diagnosing 147 patients
(73 children and 74 adults) who had a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate performed because of
suspected HLH, or whose bone marrow examination revealed hemophagocytosis (regardless of
the indication for the biopsy). This cohort of patients included 20 adults and 16 children ulti￾mately diagnosed with HLH. Each patient in the cohort was then evaluated by the HLH-2004
criteria and the HScore. At presentation, the HScore was more efficient than the HLH-2004
criteria at correctly identifying HLH for both children and adults, with a diagnostic sensitivity
and specificity of 100% and 80% for children and 90% and 79% for adults, respectively. The
performance of the HScore dropped to similar levels as the HLH-2004 criteria once the patient’s
clinical status worsened, with a sensitivity of 73% for the same specificity. The authors concluded
that for children, the HScore was generally more useful than the HLH-2004 criteria, and that for

adults, the HScore was most useful only during initial presentation of the patient. The authors
also concluded that the originally published optimal cutoff of 169 should be adapted depending
on the target population (83). This has been done in a group of patients with HLH secondary
to autoimmune diseases. In a cohort of 94 patients with rheumatologic disease (of whom 30 had
HLH and 64 were controls), the optimal cutoff value was found to be 190.5 (sensitivity of 96.7%
and specificity of 98.4%) (84).
Other Diagnostic Scoring Systems and Criteria
Other diagnostic scoring systems and criteria have been examined for certain HLH populations
(e.g., MAS), but none has gained widespread acceptance (82).
TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS OF HEMOPHAGOCYTIC
LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS
Treatment Rationale
Because HLH is a syndrome of unbridled immune activation, the goal of therapy is to reverse the
deleterious uncontrolled immune response. The mainstay of acute therapy includes immunosup￾pressive and myelosuppressive agents, most frequently high-dose corticosteroids, typically dexam￾ethasone, and the epipodophyllotoxin topoisomerase-II inhibitor etoposide. Without treatment,
primary HLH is nearly uniformly fatal (85). Mortality rates in patients with secondary HLH
without treatment are not as well defined, but the current literature suggests a mortality rate of
50–75% (24).
This review discusses treatment of HLH in both children and adults, although there are no
prospective clinical trials of the first-line treatment of HLH in adults; much of the treatment
recommendations in adults are extrapolated from the data in children. Similarly, patients with
primary HLH and those with secondary HLH are generally initially treated the same (indeed,
the presence or absence of underlying genetic defects is almost never known at the time of initial
presentation). An important distinction, however, is that of postremission management. Primary
HLH patients are universally receive stem cell transplant following achieving remission of their
initial disease if it is not contraindicated, whereas this is more variable in secondary HLH.
History
In 1980, Ambruso and colleagues (86) published the first successful cases of remission induction
in two children with HLH treated with etoposide; although the use of this cytotoxic therapy
proved successful at induction of a first remission, patients would invariably relapse and often
succumb to fatal central nervous system (CNS) disease. In 1985, Fischer and colleagues (87)
published a series of four children with HLH in which remission was successfully induced using
a combination of etoposide, corticosteroids, intrathecal methotrexate, and cranial irradiation,
allowing for a more durable remission. Similarly, the efficacy of the related epipodophyllotoxin
topoisomerase-II inhibitor teniposide in remission induction was demonstrated in 1986 (88).
Unfortunately, even with an approach that incorporated CNS-directed therapy as part of
induction, children with familial HLH who achieved remission would eventually relapse and
die of HLH. Fischer and colleagues (89) published the first case of successful allogeneic HSCT
in a child with primary, familial HLH in 1986. Furthermore, in 1993, an alternative treatment
approach utilizing immunotherapeutic agents in lieu of an epipodophyllotoxin was published (90).

The authors treated six patients with a combination of methylprednisolone, rabbit antithymocyte
globulin, and cyclosporin A, which was successful in five of the six cases.
HLH-94 Trial
The HLH-94 trial was the first international HLH clinical trial, and combined myelosuppressive/
cytotoxic treatment with epipodophyllotoxins with immunosuppressive therapy. A total of 249
children (<16 years old) with HLH as defined by the HLH-94 diagnostic criteria (requiring
the presence of all five of the following: fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia or pancytopenia, hy￾pertriglyceridemia or hypofibrinogenemia, and evidence of hemophagocytosis without evidence
of underlying malignancy) were enrolled from July 1994 through December 2003. These pa￾tients were treated with an initial 8-week-long therapeutic course of etoposide (150 mg/m2 twice
weekly for two weeks and then weekly) plus dexamethasone (initial dose of 10 mg/m2, slowly
tapered over the 8-week initial course of treatment). After the initial 8-week therapy, children
with either known familial disease or persistent nonfamilial disease received continuation therapy
as a bridge to allogeneic HSCT. Continuation therapy consisted of cyclosporine A, dexametha￾sone, and etoposide, with intrathecal methotrexate administered in the case of progressive neuro￾logical symptoms or a persistently abnormal CSF. Conditioning for allogeneic HSCT included
cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and etoposide, with horse antithymocyte globulin added in trans￾plants from matched unrelated donors; graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis was carried out with
a combination methotrexate and cyclosporine A (91). The most recent publication of long-term
outcomes from the trial, published in 2011, demonstrated an estimated 5-year probability of sur￾vival of 54% +/− 6% (median follow-up of 6.2 years) (28). 29% of patients died before receiving
allogeneic HSCT stem cell transplantation, and 5-year survival for those who did receive HSCT
was 66 +/− 8%. No patient with familial HLH survived without receiving a stem cell transplant.
HLH-2004 Trial
The HLH-2004 trial, the second international HLH study and successor to HLH-94, is currently
ongoing. HLH-2004 protocol modified the HLH-94 criteria, adding low or absent NK cell
activity, hyperferritinemia, and high sIL2Rα levels to the five diagnostic criteria from HLH-94,
and requiring five of eight criteria to be satisfied for diagnosis and study inclusion. The HLH-2004
chemoimmunotherapy protocol was modified from its predecessor, adding cyclosporine A during
the initial therapy phase and adding intrathecal prednisolone to intrathecal methotrexate in the
treatment of CNS disease (80). The results of this trial are not yet available, although preliminary
reports suggest that adding upfront cyclosporine offered no clinical advantage; therefore, most
centers still utilize the HLH-94 protocol for the treatment of HLH.
Treatment of Adult Patients
As previously noted, no prospective trials for the first-line treatment of HLH in adults exist. Adult
patients are therefore treated with regimens that approximate the HLH-94 protocol. Although
traditionally used only in patients who relapse, transplantation is used increasingly in patients
with disease that is difficult to control, that responds slowly to therapy, or that recurs following
remission. Reduced intensity conditioning, such as with fludarabine and busulfan, has been shown
to be superior to fully myeloablative conditioning in patients with HLH, and this approach has
been widely adopted (92). Moreover, conditioning regimens have been modernized, incorporating

the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab as a preparatory agent (93). A representative
algorithm for the treatment of adult patients with HLH is shown in Figure 2.
Because a significant minority of adults do not respond to treatment according to the HLH-94
protocol or its variations, investigations into salvage therapeutic options have been undertaken
in recent years. In 2015, the results of a prospective, multicenter Chinese trial examining the
utility of combination doxorubicin, etoposide, and methylprednisolone (DEP) in refractory adult
HLH patients were published (94). Unlike the HLH-94 trial in children (which excluded pa￾tients with underlying malignancy or immunosuppression), nearly half of the 63 patients enrolled
had lymphoma-associated HLH. Of this refractory adult population, 27.0% achieved a complete
response, 49.2% achieved a partial response, and the remaining patients died within 4 weeks of
receiving therapy. Of the 48 responding patients, 29 survived to receive further chemotherapy,
allogeneic HSCT, or splenectomy. This was the first prospective clinical trial in adult HLH.
The following year, the same group published results of a modified DEP regimen plus PEG￾asparaginase (L-DEP) for the treatment of refractory EBV-associated HLH, which resulted in an
overall response rate of 85.7% (95).
Experimental Agents
Over the past several years, novel targeted agents have been identified as possible treatments for
HLH. Two of these agents are discussed briefly in this section.
Ruxolitinib. The Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, currently FDA approved in the United
States for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, has been examined
42 Al-Samkari · Berliner

in a murine model of HLH. Cytotoxicity-impaired PRF1(−/−) and Rab27a(−/−) mice with the
manifestations of HLH were treated with ruxolitinib, with improvement in manifestations in both
murine models (specifically improvement in cytopenias, rapid decrease in serum IL-6 and TNF-α
levels, improvement in liver injury, and reduction in CNS involvement). Such positive results of
an off-the-shelf, currently available agent are encouraging because clinical trials could readily be
undertaken in humans (96).
Emapalumab. Emapalumab (NI-0501, Novimmune) is a fully human, high-affinity anti-IFN-γ
monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes human IFN-γ. In 2015, the first results from
an open-label phase II study of emapalumab in 13 children with primary HLH were reported (97).
Twelve of the children were refractory to standard first-line therapy or intolerant of it; one child
was treated with emapalumab in the first-line setting. The majority of the patients were felt to
have severe disease, and nine had a known HLH-associated genetic defect. Nine of the 13 patients
achieved a satisfactory response, with seven proceeding to allogeneic HSCT; in total, 11 of the
13 patients were alive at 8 weeks.
Treatment of Macrophage Activation Syndrome
No controlled studies on the management of MAS exist, and so treatment is primarily based on
case series and expert recommendations. It is clear that these patients, unlike those with primary
HLH, do not require first-line therapy with cytotoxic agents according to the HLH-94 protocol
and instead are best treated with high-dose corticosteroids plus any relevant therapy directed at
the underlying autoimmune disease (31). Cases refractory to corticosteroids have been successfully
treated with cyclosporine A (98), and the efficacy of this agent has led to its use in first-line therapy
by some investigators (31).
The efficacy of cytotoxic agents such as etoposide in the refractory setting is not well defined.
Targeted anticytokine therapies, such as etanercept, anakinra, and tocilizumab, have also shown
promise in the treatment of MAS (31).
Prognosis
Early studies of children with familial HLH demonstrated that the disease is almost uniformly fatal
without therapy (85). Long-term follow-up from the HLH-94 trial demonstrated an estimated
5-year probability of survival of 54% with a median follow-up of 6.2 years. Factors in this trial
that predicted poor prognosis included very young age at the start of therapy (41% survival
at <6 months of age versus 65% survival at >6 months of age) and neurologic involvement
(40% versus 67%); the presence or absence of a causative mutation was not predictive of a worse
outcome, although the vast majority of patients with causative mutations underwent allogeneic
HSCT, versus approximately half of those without causative mutations (28). The rate of decline
of serum ferritin in children with HLH was found to be prognostic in a retrospective study,
which demonstrated a substantial increase in the likelihood of death for patients who had a ferritin
decline of <50% versus those with a 96% or greater decline with treatment [odds ratio (OR) =
17.42]; a higher-peak ferritin measured within the first 3 weeks after presentation was also a poor
prognostic indicator (OR = 5.6) (99).
The most common late effects in HLH-94 trial survivors were neurologic (such as severe
mental retardation, cranial nerve palsies, and epilepsy), occurring in 19% of all surviving patients
and 31% of surviving familial HLH patients. Non-neurologic late effects, which occurred in

16% of patients, included nutritional problems, growth retardation, hypertension, impaired renal
function, obstructive bronchiolitis, and hearing impairment (28).
Conclusions regarding the prognosis of adults with HLH have been drawn from large published
case series; outcomes have generally been poor. In a recent large retrospective US cohort of
68 adults with HLH, 31% of patients were alive after 32.2 months of median follow-up; the median
overall survival was 4 months. Patients with malignancy-associated HLH had the worst prognosis,
with a median survival of 2.8 months (versus 10.7 months for those with nonmalignancy-associated
disease). The median survival for patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT was 21.5 months (29). In
a large European cohort of 162 adult patients with HLH, features associated with a poor prognosis
in multivariate analysis were advanced age, lower platelet count, underlying lymphoma, and lack
of inclusion of etoposide in the initial therapeutic regimen (100).
CONCLUSION
HLH is a multisystem disorder of immune dysregulation, typically in the setting of an immuno￾logic challenge, that results in serious morbidity and mortality. Although HLH was originally
described in 1939, it is within the past three decades that the majority of the literature has been
published, and therefore, the current understanding of the disorder has developed. Understanding
of the pathophysiology of the disease is incomplete and epidemiologic data in adults are sparse.
Very few prospective trials have been performed in the treatment of this rare disease, and fewer still
in adult patients, with the first prospective trial of treatment of adult HLH published in 2015. Im￾proved understanding of the disorder, refined diagnostic criteria, and advancements in measurable
markers of disease will allow for earlier diagnosis and prompt initiation of novel disease-modifying
therapies, which will improve outcomes for this challenging, life-threatening syndrome.
