Table S1. Comorbidity variable definitions
Comorbidity Definition (presence of any of the following)
Diabetes • Any cause of diabetes
• Type I diabetes – Insulin required from time of diagnosis
• Type II diabetes – Treatment with diet-control, oral antidiabetic medication or 
insulin
Ischaemic heart 
disease
• Angina – chest pain on exertion, relieved by rest or Glyceryl Trinitrate. As 
reported by patient or as documented in the case notes, with or without ECG 
changes, exercise tolerance testing or other imaging
• Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) – troponin rise and 
non-ST segment elevation ischaemic ECG changes such as ST depression, T-wave 
inversion or no ECG changes.
• ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) – troponin rise and ST 
segment elevation on ECG.
• Percutaneous coronary intervention (coronary angioplasty with or without stent 
insertion)
• Coronary artery bypass graft operation
Heart failure • Congestive cardiac failure
• Left ventricular failure
• Right ventricular failure
• Left or right ventricular dysfunction on cardiac echo
• Ejection fraction <30% on cardiac echo
Atrial fibrillation • Patients in chronic atrial fibrillation at the time of recruitment, previous isolated 
episodes not included
Cardiac valve 
replacement
• Any kind of cardiac valve replacement or repair
Pacemaker • Permanent pacemaker in-situ
Cerebrovascular 
disease
• Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) – also known as “mini-stroke”. Transient 
episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by ischaemia without infarction. 
Symptoms typically lasting less than 24 hours.
• Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) including:
o Ischaemic stroke
o Cerebral haemorrhage
o Subarachnoid haemorrhage
o Subdural haemorrhage
• Previous carotid intervention including:
o Carotid endarterectomy
o Carotid angioplasty
Peripheral vascular 
disease
• Claudication – lower limb pain on walking as reported by the patient, with or 
without doppler or angiographic evidence.
• Radiological diagnosis
• Radiological or surgical intervention including:
o Angioplasty
o Endarterectomy
o Bypass graft
o Amputation of any part of limb
Abdominal aortic 
aneurysm
• Radiological diagnosis under surveillance
• Previous endovascular aneurysm repair
• Previous open surgical repair
Chronic respiratory 
disease
• Any kind of chronic respiratory disease including:
• Asthma – inflammatory condition of the lungs causing recurrent attacks of 
breathlessness and wheezing, differs in severity and occurs in all age groups.
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – chronic and progressive airflow 
obstruction that is not fully reversible. FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 and FEV1 < 80% 
predicted.

• Bronchiectasis – abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the bronchi due to 
destruction of elastic and muscular tissue by acute or chronic inflammation and 
infection. Results in chronic infections and airway obstruction.
Chronic liver 
disease
• Persistent enzyme evidence of hepatic dysfunction with imaging or biopsy 
evidence of cirrhotic or noncirrhotic liver disease
• Excludes cholecystitis or gallstones
Blood borne 
viruses
• Hepatitis C
• Hepatitis B
• HIV
Malignancy • Diagnosis of any malignancy in the past or in the present. Does not include benign 
tumours such as breast adenoma, colon polyp, actinic keratosis etc.
Mental illness • Any diagnosis of mental illness e.g. depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder, 
substance abuse, deliberate self-harm, schizophrenia
Data for comorbidities were extracted from patient case notes, local electronic patient information systems 
and/or confirmed with the patients named consultant nephrologist at the time of recruitment to ATTOM.
