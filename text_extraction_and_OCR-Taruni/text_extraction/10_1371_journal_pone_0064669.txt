Abstract
Objective: To evaluate bone marrow stem cell treatment (BMSC) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and no option
of revascularization.
Background: Autologous BMSC therapy has emerged as a novel approach to treat patients with acute myocardial infarction
or chronic ischemia and heart failure following percutaneous or surgical revascularization, respectively. However, the effect
of the treatment has not been systematic evaluated in patients who are not eligible for revascularization.
Methods: MEDLINE (1950–2012), EMBASE (1980–2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8) and ongoing trial
databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. Trials where participants were diagnosed with IHD, with
no option for revascularization and who received any dose of stem cells by any delivery route were selected for inclusion.
Study and participant characteristics, details of the intervention and comparator, and outcomes measured were recorded by
two reviewers independently. Primary outcome measures were defined as mortality and measures of angina; secondary
outcomes were heart failure, quality of life measures, exercise/performance and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Results: Nine trials were eligible for inclusion. BMSC treatment significantly reduced the risk of mortality (Relative Risk 0.33;
95% Confidence Interval 0.17 to 0.65; P = 0.001). Patients who received BMSC showed a significantly greater improvement in
CCS angina class (Mean Difference 20.55; 95% Confidence Interval 21.00 to 20.10; P = 0.02) and significantly fewer angina
episodes per week at the end of the trial (Mean Difference 25.21; 95% Confidence Interval 27.35 to 23.07; P,0.00001)
than those who received no BMSC. In addition, the treatment significantly improved quality of life, exercise/performance
and LVEF in these patients.
Conclusions: BMSC treatment has significant clinical benefit as stand-alone treatment in patients with IHD and no other
treatment option. These results require confirmation in large well-powered trials with long-term follow-up to fully evaluate
the clinical efficacy of this treatment.

Introduction
The incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is increasing
exponentially worldwide as a consequence of improved long-term
survival following medical therapy and percutaneous or surgical
revascularization procedures. Autologous bone marrow-derived
stem cell (BMSC) therapy has emerged as a novel approach to
treat patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) despite successful revascularization by
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and patients with
chronic ischemia and heart failure who have received surgical
revascularization [1–4]. Globally, BMSC significantly improves
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 3–4% in patients who
suffered from AMI [2,5]. Phase I/II clinical trials have also been
conducted administering BMSC as treatment for ischemic heart
failure (HF). The treatment has proven to be safe and feasible and
the treatment effect is promising [6–9]. However, some of the
early studies comprise cohort studies that lack the appropriate
control for the intervention [10,11]. More recently, a number of
randomized trials have treated patients with ischemic HF where
revascularization procedures were administered concomitantly [6–
9]. Considering that revascularization procedures have improved
the management and long-term outcome of IHD greatly, it
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e64669

becomes more difficult to assess the benefits of BMSC treatment
when administered as a co-intervention. Recently, several
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested BMSC as
treatment for those patients receiving maximal medical therapy,
with symptoms of intractable angina or HF and where patients
were not eligible for revascularization [12–20]. We consider that
the evaluation of BMSC treatment as a stand-alone therapy is
critical and may be beneficial for those patients who have
exhausted all conventional therapies and where revascularization
is no longer an option due to the lack of suitable conduit vessels or
the diffuse nature of the disease. Here we present a systematic
review and meta-analysis of autologous BMSC treatment in this
cohort of patients. In this study, mononuclear cells harvested by
density gradient centrifugation or leukapheresis, and/or enriched
in hematopoietic stem cells (e.g. CD34-positive or Aldehyde
Dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells) by magnetic cell separation
or cell sorting are referred to as BMSC.
Methods
Eligibility
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), (ii) participants with no option for percutaneous or
surgical revascularization, diagnosed with IHD, with symptoms of
angina or HF according to the Canadian Cardiology Society (CCS
class II–IV) and New York Heart Association (NYHA class II–IV),
and receiving maximal medical treatment, (iii) any dose of BMSC,
(iv) any delivery route, and (v) any other co-intervention provided
it was administered equally to all arms in the trial. BMSC were
defined as mononuclear cells that were harvested by density
gradient centrifugation or leukapheresis, and in some cases further
enriched in hematopoietic stem cells (CD34-positive or ALDH￾positive cells) by magnetic cell separation or cell sorting prior to
administering them to participants. Exclusion criteria: trials
involving participants with IHD who were eligible for revascular￾ization by percutaneous or surgical procedures. RCTs included
administered cells harvested from the bone marrow or from
peripheral blood after bone marrow mobilization, referred to here
as bone marrow-derived stem cells.
Search Strategy
MEDLINE (1950–2012), EMBASE (1974–2012), CENTRAL
(The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), CINAHL (1982–2012),
PUBMED (epublications only), LILACS, KOREAMED,
INDMED, PAKMEDINET, and the Transfusion Evidence
Library were searched through to 21st August 2012 for RCTs
that follow the inclusion criteria detailed above. Ongoing trial
registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN Register, the World
Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Platform Reg￾istry, UMIN-CTR Japanese Clinical Registry and the Hong Kong
Clinical Trials Registry) were also searched. Searches were
combined with adaptations of the Cochrane highly sensitive
RCT search filter in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL.
Proceedings from the American Heart Association (2005–2011)
and European Society of Cardiology (2005–2011) conferences and
the reference lists of identified studies and relevant review articles
were handsearched for additional studies. No restriction by
language, year of publication or publication status was applied.
Detailed search strategies are available from the authors upon
request.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Eligibility screening, data extraction and assessment of meth￾odological quality were undertaken by two independent reviewers.
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data extracted from
included studies were as follows: (i) characteristics of the patient
population and the study, (ii) type of intervention and comparator,
and (iii) outcomes measured. Primary outcome measures were
defined as mortality and measures of angina (CCS class and
frequency of angina episodes). Secondary outcomes included
NYHA class, quality of life (QoL) measures, exercise/physical
performance, LVEF and myocardial perfusion.
Assessment of the quality of studies was made according to The
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in
randomized trials which is based on the generation of random
sequence, concealment of treatment allocation, blinding of
participants, clinicians and outcome assessors and loss to follow￾up [21].
Statistical Analysis
RevMan 5.1 [22] was used to analyze outcome data.
Dichotomous outcomes are presented as Relative Risk (RR) with
95% Confidence Intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, the
mean change from baseline over the study follow-up period was
the preferred measure of outcome; the mean value at endpoint was
used where insufficient data were available to calculate the mean
change from baseline. Where standard deviations were not
explicitly reported, these were estimated where possible from
reported P values or CIs. Continuous outcomes are presented as
mean difference (MD) between treatment groups with a 95% CI.
For QoL and performance measures, the standardized MD (SMD)
was used in order to allow analyses of outcomes measured on
different scales. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed effect
models, except when a high degree of heterogeneity was observed,
where random effects models were used. The I2 statistic [23,24]
was used to evaluate statistical heterogeneity, where an I2 statistic
.75% denotes high heterogeneity [24]. P,0.05 was considered
statistically significant; two-sided significance values are reported
throughout.
Results
Description of the included studies
A total of 7422 citations were identified initially (Figure 1) using
the search strategies detailed in Methods S1; these were reduced to
1983 citations after removal of duplicates and preliminary
screening for relevance by the Information Specialist. Screening
of these 1983 citations by two reviewers, independently and in
duplicate, eliminated a further 1884 records. The remaining 99
citations (55 full text articles and 44 conference abstracts) were
assessed for eligibility. From these, 69 citations were excluded as
they did not fully meet the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). The
remaining 11 full text articles and 19 conference abstracts
contributed to nine independent trials [12–20,25,26] included in
this systematic review. The characteristics of the included studies
are shown in Table S1.
In one study [13], patients received one of three treatment arms:
either a placebo or one of two doses of mobilized autologous
CD34+ cells (16105 or 56105 cells/kg); these are denoted low
dose (LD) and high dose (HD). To avoid double counting of the
control group which can result in correlated results between the
two treatment arms, this trial was analysed by two different
methodological approaches. Firstly, data from the two BMSC
treatment groups were pooled into a single trial arm and
compared with the control group; secondly, the control group
was divided into two groups of equal size and effect, allowing for
separate analysis of each BMSC treatment group. Results for both
methods were similar for all analyses (data not shown) and
Stem Cells Treatment and Non-Revascularisation

therefore, results for this study are presented for each BMSC
treatment group separately with an equally divided control group
providing a comparator arm for both treatment groups.
A second study [12] randomized patients to one of four
treatment arms: either a placebo or one of four doses of mobilized
autologous CD34+ cells (56104
, 16105 or 56105 cells/kg).
However, no dose-response effect was found in this trial and
results were therefore reported for the combined treatment groups.
The included trials compared BMSC treatment to control in a
total of 659 patients (363 BMSC and 296 controls) (see Table S1).
Four trials treated patients with ischemic HF [14–17] whilst five
trials treated patients with intractable angina [12,13,18–20]. Study
sample sizes ranged from 10 to 56 for BMSC and from 6 to 56 for
controls.
Five of the nine included studies harvested BMSC directly from
the bone marrow by aspiration and enriched the cell fraction with
mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation [14,15,17–
19]. Two trials [12,13] treated patients in the control and
treatment groups with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G￾CSF) prior to isolating BMSC from peripheral blood by
leukapheresis and enriching the BMSC population in CD34-
positive cells by magnetic separation. In a third trial [20], patients
were treated with G-CSF and CD34-positive cells isolated from
bone marrow aspirates. One trial [16] enriched the bone marrow
mononuclear cell fraction in ALHD-positive cells by cell sorting
prior to administration. All trials maintained the patients under
maximal standard medication throughout the trials.
All trials presented outcome measures within six months follow￾up and two [13,17] conducted longer follow-up of patients, up to
12 months.
Methodological quality assessment of included studies
Overall, the methodological quality of the included trials was
good. Treatment was randomized in all studies; adequate methods
of randomization sequence generation were employed in all but
two trials [12,20] in which the method of randomization was not
reported, and concealment of treatment allocation was unclear in
two trials [12,17]. Methods of randomization included computer
generated randomization sequences or codes generated from
randomization tables which were distributed using numbered
sealed envelopes. In one study [13], treatment was assigned by the
cell-processing laboratory using a telephone call-in and interactive
voice-response system. In all but one study [17], controls received
a placebo, or in one case, a simulated mock injection procedure
[14]. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation in all
trials. At least 89% (range 89% to 100%) of randomized
participants were included in the analysis of the study primary
outcome in all but one study [17]. In this study of patients with
end-stage chronic HF, a high rate of mortality (25% of all
participants) was observed during the follow-up period. Four of the
included studies [13,15,18,19] reported a power calculation to
determine the sample size required to show a significant effect of
the primary outcome.
Primary outcomes
(i) Mortality. All included trials reported mortality due to
any cause. Five trials [12,14,16,18,20] reported no incidence of
mortality throughout the follow-up period. One trial [17] observed
a high incidence of mortality (BMSC: 10.9%; controls: 38.9%)
during the trial; this was likely due to the severe end-stage HF
diagnosis of the patients in this study compared with the other
included studies. In the remaining three trials, a total of three
deaths were observed in untreated patients [13] compared with
two deaths in the BMSC group [15,19]. Of the two deaths in
patients who received BMSC treatment, one was due to acute HF
[19], the other was deemed unlikely to be associated with cell
therapy [15]. The reasons for mortality in the three control group
participants were not reported [13]. Meta-analysis of all trials
which reported incidence of mortality showed a significantly
reduced risk of mortality in patients who received BMSC
compared with controls (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.65;
P = 0.001) (Figure 2A).
Six trials [12,14,16,18–20] reported mortality due to reinfarc￾tion as an outcome; none of these reported any incidence of
mortality due to reinfarction during the trial follow-up period.

However, in one trial [18], one death at 31 months due to
reinfarction was reported in an individual who received placebo.
Eight trials [12–16,18–20] reported morbidity of myocardial
infarction as an outcome; four of these trials [12,14,19,20]
reported no incidence of myocardial infarction throughout the
trial. Meta-analysis of the four trials which reported myocardial

infarction in at least one of the treatment arms showed a reduced
risk of myocardial infarction associated with BMSC although this
failed to reach statistical significance (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.24 to
1.27; P = 0.16).
(ii) Measures of angina. Clinical angina status, according to
the CCS angina class, was reported as an outcome in all studies.
However, one trial [13] only reported the percentage of patients in
each treatment group with a change (improvement or worsening)
in CCS class. In particular, this study reported a $2-class
improvement in CCS class over the length of the trial in 23.1% of
LD and 25.0% HD treated patients compared with only 15.2% of
controls. Another trial [15] reported only that there were ‘‘no
significant differences in the change in CCS class’’. Two further
studies [16,18] only reported CCS class at the end of the trial and
insufficient data were reported to enable calculation of standard
deviations of the mean change from baseline values; neither of
these trials reported a significant difference in CCS class between
treatment groups at the end of the trial. Meta-analysis of the five
remaining trials [12,14,17,19,20] showed a significant difference in
mean change from baseline between groups in favor of BMSC
(MD 20.55; 95% CI 21.00 to 20.10; p = 0.02) (Figure 2B).
Angina frequency (number of episodes per week) was measured
in four trials [12,13,17,20], although only two trials [12,20]
reported mean change in angina frequency from baseline and
therefore, angina frequency was compared between treatment
groups at the end of the trial. Meta-analysis of the number of
angina episodes per week revealed a significant difference between
treatment groups in favor of BMSC (MD 25.21; 95% CI 27.35
to 23.07; p,0.00001) (Figure 2C).
Secondary outcomes
(i) Functional status for heart failure (NYHA
class). Functional data on HF, according to NYHA classifica￾tion, was measured in four studies [14,16–18] Mean change in
NYHA class from baseline to the end of the trial was not reported
in two studies and therefore, NYHA class was compared between
treatment groups at the end of the trial. NYHA class was
significantly lower in patients treated with BMSC than in controls
in all but one study [16]. High heterogeneity was observed across
studies (I2= 98%; 95% CI 96.7% to 98.8%). Pooled evidence
across studies using a random effects model showed a lower
NYHA class at the end of the trial in patients who received BMSC
compared with controls, although this difference did not reach
statistical significance (MD 20.56; 95% CI 21.29 to 0.17;
P = 0.13).
(ii) QoL. Patient-reported quality-of-life measures were re￾ported in four studies. These included the Seattle Angina
Questionnaire [13,19], Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
(MLHF) Questionnaire [14,17] and SF-36 Health Survey [14]. All
four studies observed an improvement in QoL in patients who
received BMSC compared with controls although this improve￾ment was only statistically significant in one trial [17]. In order to
assess QoL measures across all studies simultaneously, Seattle
Angina Questionnaire and MLHF Questionnaire data were
combined in a meta-analysis (as described in the Methods section).
Pooled evidence across studies showed a significant improvement
in QoL (SMD 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60; P = 0.002) (Figure 3A).
(iii) Performance and exercise. Performance and exercise
capacity measures were reported in six studies. Measures included
a standard Bruce protocol treadmill exercise tolerance test [12,20],
a modified Bruce protocol treadmill exercise tolerance test [13,18],
a six minute walking test [17] and a symptom-limited bicycle
exercise test [19]. One study [17] did not report sufficient data to
calculate mean change from baseline data, although this study did
report a significant increase from baseline in the distance walked at
the end of the trial in patients who received BMSC but not in
controls. Pooled data from the remaining five studies showed a
significant improvement in exercise performance in patients who
received BMSC compared with controls (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.13
to 0.56; P = 0.002) (Figure 3B).
(iv) Heart contractility: left ventricular ejection
fraction. Six studies [14–19] reported LVEF (%) although one
study [16] did not provide sufficient data to calculate the standard
deviation of the mean change from baseline. Of the the remaining
five studies, only two [15,19] reported a significant difference in
mean change in LVEF from baseline in patients who received
BMSC compared with controls. However, when data from all five
studies were pooled, the combined evidence across studies showed
a significant difference in mean change from baseline between
treatment groups, in favor of BMSC (MD 3.47; 95% CI 1.88 to
5.06; P = 0.00002) (Figure 3C).
(v) Myocardial perfusion. Myocardial perfusion was mea￾sured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
imaging and reported in all included trials. However, there was
low consistency in the methods and extent of reporting (automated
versus visual interpretation, stress/rest/total defect size, summed
stress/rest/difference scores) and therefore, no formal statistical
comparison of results could be made. Nevertheless, seven of the
nine trials reported a greater improvement in at least one measure
of myocardial perfusion in patients who received BMSC compared
with controls.
Discussion
We present here the results of a systematic review and meta￾analysis of RCTs where autologous BMSC treatment is admin￾istered to patients with IHD who are not eligible for revascular￾ization. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and
meta-analysis that evaluates BMSC treatment as stand-alone
therapy.
In all trials except one, the cells were delivered into viable
myocardium using electromechanical mapping and the effect of
intramyocardial injection was controlled by a mock injection in the
placebo/control arm of the trial. Our previous work suggests that
this delivery method is more effective that intracoronary infusion
(5). These trials used mostly bone marrow mononuclear cells with
the exception of three in which CD34-positive cells were enriched
and one in which ALDH-positive cells were sorted, all from the
mononuclear cell fraction, but the dose administered in each trial
varied. Altogether, our data suggest that BMSC treatment is safe
and significantly reduces mortality and angina in patients with no
other treatment option. These results are extremely encouraging
and potentially very important in this cohort of patients. Other
trials in which bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are
modified during culture to induce a cardiogenic phenotype are
underway [27] (abstr). In the future, it will be interesting to
evaluate whether different cell populations and different cell
processing methods may yield comparable treatment effects.
All nine included trials reported mortality as an outcome,
although only five trials reported any incidence of mortality in
either trial arm and only these trials contributed to the risk ratio
(RR) estimate (Figure 1A). The dramatic reduction in mortality
may be due to the cohort of patients included (angina and/or HF
according to NYHA and CCS class II–IV). In particular, one
study [17] recruited patients with HF at a more advanced stage
(NYHA class III–IV). Although the results of this meta-analysis
suggest a significant reduction of mortality, they have to be
considered with caution and confirmed in larger clinical trials.

Reduction of mortality has been demonstrated in very few trials
and never in a meta-analysis of AMI studies [2].
A significant reduction in angina symptoms was demonstrated
using two measures of angina: CCS class and frequency of
episodes per week. Meta-analysis of an aggregate measure of
angina was not performed since the mean change from baseline
was not reported in all trials. Additionally, the risk estimate
obtained using the SMD, a method which can be used to analyse
aggregate measures, has limited interpretation value. However,
the significant mean difference between treatment and control
arms for both measures provides compelling evidence that BMSC
reduces symptoms of angina.
The included trials fall into two categories: those treating
patients with ischemic HF and those treating refractory angina

patients, and their primary outcome differs depending on the
objective of the trial. Interestingly, and despite this clinical
heterogeneity, the present study shows that statistical heterogeneity
among included trials is low for most of the outcomes measured,
suggesting that the treatment has very similar effect on all the
trials. This conflicts with the high heterogeneity observed in our
previous meta-analysis where only AMI trials were included [1,2]
(e.g. LVEF, I2= 73% (95% CI: 63.7% to 79.4%)) and in a recent
systematic review that identified 50 trials of BMSC treatment in
IHD [3] and combined RCTs with cohort studies as well as AMI
and chronic IHD and HF (e.g. LVEF, I2= 80% (95% CI: 72.9%
to 85.2%)). Whilst the current study has lower statistical power to
detect heterogeneity due to the lower number of included studies,
the upper confidence limit of I2 for LVEF and other outcomes
suggests that at most, moderate heterogeneity exists between these
studies [24]. Conversely, the large number of studies included in
the previous meta-analyses provided high statistical power for
detecting heterogeneity [1–3]. These discrepancies may be
explained by, but not limited to, (i) revascularization procedures
being a source of variability during treatment and/or (ii) the
administration of cells into viable myocardium leading to a more
efficient and more efficacious delivery method.
The present study shows that BMSC treatment also significantly
improves QoL and performance status compared to controls.
Studies with participants with symptoms of angina and/or HF
according to NYHA and CCS class II–IV were eligible for
inclusion. The high heterogeneity observed for NYHA class may
be due to different baseline values in some studies.
For outcomes measured on different scales such as QoL and
exercise performance measures described here, the standardized
mean difference (SMD) provides a useful method of standardizing
measurements into a uniform scale so that they can be pooled in a
meta-analysis. As noted above, results from a meta-analysis of
measurements on different scales using the SMD can be difficult to
interpret as the effect of the intervention is expressed in
standardized units rather than the original units of measurements.
A study which evaluated the correlation (Pearson’s correlation
coefficient, r) between MLHF questionnaire and Seattle Angina
Questionnaire showed a highly significant correlation between
these measures in patients with both angina (r = 0.826) and HF
(r = 0.821) [28]. Nevertheless, the interpretation of results from
such an analysis using standardized measures should be treated
with caution.
The results of this study also suggest that BMSC treatment
significantly improves global LVEF by 3–4%. As a stand-alone
therapy, BMSC seems to have a beneficial effect on global heart
contractility as previously observed [2,4,29].
The present systematic review and meta-analysis has a number
of advantages over previous ones. Firstly, it evaluates the effect of
BMSC treatment in a cohort of patients who suffer from IHD and
are not eligible for percutaneous or surgical revascularization.
Secondly, it assesses the effect of treatment on clinical outcomes
such as HF and angina symptoms, QoL and physical exercise/
performance, that have not been fully evaluated previously. These
clinical outcomes are extremely important in the management of
the disease in this cohort as the patients have no other treatment
option.
The present study has two main limitations. First, the small
number of trials included and the size of the trials require that
conclusions from this systematic review and meta-analysis are
considered cautiously and may need to be substantiated with
larger clinical trials. Moreover, this is also a restriction in
conducting further sensitivity analyses, investigating potential
sources of heterogeneity and evaluating publication bias. Second,
the length of follow-up in the included studies is relatively short (6
and 12 months). The field would benefit from long-term follow-up
to confirm the efficacy of this treatment.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a significant beneficial
effect of BMSC as a stand-alone treatment for patients with IHD
without the option of revascularization and where cells are injected
into viable myocardium. Larger well-powered trials with long-term
follow-up will be needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of BMSC
and the optimal delivery method in this cohort of patients.
