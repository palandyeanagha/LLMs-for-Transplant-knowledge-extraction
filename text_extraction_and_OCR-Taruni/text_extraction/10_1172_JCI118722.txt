Introduction
Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogues in which the
oxygen bridge has been replaced by a carbon with various side
chains (P-C-P). These compounds have been known to the
chemists since the 19th century, the first synthesis dating back
to 1865 (1). They were first used in various industrial proce￾dures, among others as anticorrosive and antiscaling agents
(2). After discovering that they can effectively control calcium
phosphate formation and dissolution in vitro (3, 4), as well as
mineralization and bone resorption in vivo (3, 4), they were
developed and used in the treatment of bone diseases, mostly
Paget’s disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and, lately, os￾teoporosis (for review see reference 5).
General properties
The bisphosphonate group, like pyrophosphate, binds strongly
to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite (6). This explains the spe￾cific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineral￾ized tissues, especially bone. Indeed, they deposit where bone
mineral is exposed to the surrounding fluids, thus, especially
where bone is formed and resorbed. The release of bisphos￾phonates occurs primarily when the bone where they are de￾posited is resorbed again, accounting for their long in vivo
half-life in humans (7). The P-C-P group is resistant to enzy￾matic hydrolysis, which explains why bisphosphonates are not
metabolized in the body and are excreted unaltered. Bisphos￾phonates released during bone remodeling might therefore be
pharmacologically active. The amount of bisphosphonate re￾leased daily in this manner after 10 yr of treatment is estimated
at z 25% of the amount absorbed from a daily dose and de￾pends upon the location in the skeleton. It will be higher for
cancellous, lower for compact bone. The charge and bulk of
the bisphosphonate group limits penetration of cell mem￾branes. This may account for the low absorption in the gut (be￾tween below 1 and 10%), which is probably paracellular (8),
and the limited cellular uptake. Bisphosphonates are rapidly
excreted by the kidney, in part by an active tubular secretion
process (9).
The key pharmacological action of bisphosphonates in clin￾ical use (or development) is inhibition of bone resorption. The
mechanism of action of these agents has not been fully eluci￾dated and could differ among bisphosphonates. The aim of this
perspective is to review the current knowledge of this subject,
to better understand the pharmacology of these compounds
and gain further insights into the mechanisms of bone resorp￾tion in general.
Bone resorption
The effects of bisphosphonates can be considered at three lev￾els: the tissue, the cellular, and the molecular ones.
Tissue level. At the tissue level, the action of all active bis￾phosphonates appears to be similar: a reduction in bone turn￾over. This is evidenced by a decrease in both bone resorption
and bone formation, as assessed by biochemical markers.
Since during bone loss, there is a negative balance at each
turnover unit (BMU), a decrease in turnover leads to a de￾crease in bone loss. Bone resorption is difficult to measure
quantitatively by morphological methods because no specific
method, such as double tetracycline labeling used for forma￾tion, is available. However, bisphosphonates reduce resorption
parameters, such as the extent of the actively resorbing area
and the depth of the erosion measured from the bone surface
(10–12).
Besides resorption, formation is decreased too, as evi￾denced by a reduction in the bone formation surface (10–13).
Since there is no evidence for reduced osteoblastic activity at
individual bone formation sites, as judged by the amount of
bone produced per unit time (10–13), it is concluded that the
reduction in total bone formation surface is secondary to di￾minished resorption and reflects reduced remodeling. The link
between bone resorption and formation has been called “cou￾pling”. Furthermore, the amount of bone formed at each indi￾vidual basic multicellular unit (BMU), measured by the thick￾ness of the newly formed bone, is not decreased but, if
anything, even increased. This interesting observation was re￾ported for several bisphosphonates (10–13). However, since
the augmentation is small, it needs to be confirmed. This find￾ing is also consistent with the observation that clodronate in￾creases collagen synthesis by bone and cartilage cells in culture
(14) and that alendronate increases mineralized nodule forma￾tion in bone marrow cultures (15).
Bisphosphonates produce a positive calcium balance in an￾imals (16) and increase the amount of bone in animals (17) and
in humans (18–22). There are several explanations for this
gain, one of which is inherent to bone turnover. Thus, a de￾crease in bone resorption is not immediately followed by the
“coupling-induced” diminution of formation, since formation
at remodeling sites initiated before treatment will proceed to

completion. This will produce a relatively rapid (4–6 mo) gain
in bone mass, through a reduction in the so-called remodeling
space. The second explanation is that after the decrease in
turnover, the newly formed bone will have less chance to be
remodeled and will therefore have more time to complete
mineralization. It has been shown that 70% of mineralization
of newly formed bone occurs within the first few weeks, but
mineral enrichment continues for a long time, thus “older”
bone has a higher mineral content (23). A reduction in turn￾over would, therefore, increase the average mineral content.
Thirdly, if the decrease in resorption depth at individual re￾modeling sites is not matched by a decrease in formation, the
local bone balance will be positive.
To summarize, at the tissue level the data for all active bis￾phosphonates are consistent with decreased bone turnover re￾sulting from decreased resorption. At the level of individual
remodeling units, there may be a positive focal bone balance:
formation exceeding resorption.
Cellular level. At the cellular level, there is general agree￾ment that the final target of bisphosphonate action is the os￾teoclast (Fig. 1). Bisphosphonates could reduce osteoclastic
bone resorption through: (a) inhibition of osteoclast recruit￾ment to the bone surface; (b) inhibition of osteoclast activity
on the bone surface; (c) shortening of the osteoclast life span;
and (d) alteration of the bone or bone mineral in ways which
reduce, by a pure physicochemical and not a cellular mecha￾nism, the rate of its dissolution. The first three effects could be
due to direct action on the osteoclast, or indirectly via action
on cells which modulate the osteoclast.
(a) Inhibition of osteoclast recruitment to the bone surface:
In vitro, several bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast differentia￾tion from bone marrow (24). In a coculture system of mouse
osteoblast-derived cells and bone marrow cells, alendronate
inhibits 1,25(OH)2D3
-induced osteoclastogenesis with an IC50
of 10–30 mM (25).The bisphosphonate is fully effective in this
system when added immediately before the fusion of mononu￾clear osteoclast precursors to form multinucleated cells. Os￾teoclast recruitment is also inhibited in cultures of fetal mouse
calvaria (26) and mice radii metatarsals (27). Furthermore, bis￾phosphonates are powerful inhibitors of macrophage prolifer￾ation (28). However, several facts suggest that this is not the
primary or at least not the only mode of action of bisphospho￾nates in vivo, since, after bisphosphonate administration, the
number of multinucleated osteoclasts on the bone surface of￾ten first increases, but the cells look inactive (17). It is only
later, after chronic administration, that the osteoclast number
decreases. The cause for the initial increase is unknown, it
could reflect a stimulation of osteoclast formation to compen￾sate for the decrease in osteoclast activity. Nevertheless, it
seems that the potency rank of bisphosphonates, when as￾sessed in vitro, correlates with effects in vivo only when sys￾tems which detect osteoclast recruitment, and not only activity,
are used.
The effect on osteoclast recruitment may be direct and/or
indirect. Recent results speak for the latter. It is now generally
accepted that cells of osteoblastic lineage control the recruit￾ment and activity of osteoclasts under physiological and patho￾logical conditions. This control was thought to be due to the
production of an as yet unknown activity, generated by osteo￾blast-lineage cells stimulating bone resorption. Recently, it was
shown that when rat osteoblastic cells are briefly (29) or con￾tinuously (30) exposed to low concentrations of potent bisphos￾phonates, their conditioned medium contains a factor(s) that
reduces osteoclastic bone resorption in culture.The decrease in
resorption was subsequently found to be due to an inhibitor of
osteoclast recruitment or survival, with a molecular weight be￾tween 1 and 10 kD, released by the osteoblasts (30, 31).
Whether the action of the inhibitor also involves cell survival is
not yet known, nor is it known which cells of the osteoblastic
lineage are involved in this mechanism. The lining cells would
be an interesting possibility (32).
(b) Inhibition of osteoclast activity on the bone surface:
Inhibition of osteoclast activity on the bone surface is strongly
supported as part of the mechanism of action, at least for some
bisphosphonates, by the fact that osteoclasts show changes in
morphology both in vitro (33, 34) and in treated animals in
vivo (17). These include changes in the cytoskeleton, especially
actin (33), and in the ruffled border (33, 35, 36), the convoluted
membrane characteristic of active osteoclasts. This mode of
action is also supported by: (i) the fact that under certain con￾ditions bisphosphonates can enter cells (37, 38), especially
those of the macrophage lineage; and (ii) the detection of ra￾dioactive alendronate exclusively inside osteoclasts but no
other cells on autoradiographs of bone and bone marrow 12 h

mechanisms of action of 
bisphosphonates.

after administration (36, 39). This selective uptake of bisphos￾phonates by osteoclasts could be due to the higher concentra￾tion present on the bone surface in the resorption space (36,
40) and the phagocytic nature of these cells. At pH 3.5, which
is likely to be present in the resorption space, 50% of the alen￾dronate, and probably of other bisphosphonates on the bone
surface, is released into the lacunae, thus leading to a local
concentration which can reach several hundred mM (36).
(c) Shortening of the osteoclast life span: The life span of
osteoclast nuclei has been estimated from histomorphometric
studies at z 2 wk (32). However, the estimation of the osteo￾clast life span is difficult and imprecise since it is thought that
nuclei are added and released from these cells. It has been pro￾posed that bisphosphonates can reduce the number of osteo￾clasts through a toxic effect, but the results were obtained at
very high concentrations. Changes in morphology, but no os￾teoclast toxicity, were apparent at the light or EM level in
bone sections from animals treated with alendronate (34, 36,
39). Recently, it was reported that risedronate increases osteo￾clast apoptosis, a phenomenon which is different from toxic
cell death, and this was proposed as a general mechanism for
bisphosphonate action (41). It is, however, not clear whether
apoptosis is directly induced by bisphosphonates and, if so, by
what mechanism.
(d) Alteration of bone mineral: The earliest hypothesis for
bisphosphonate action on bone proposed physical effects on
mineral dissolution. Although bisphosphonates, like pyro￾phosphate, could affect this process, it is now obvious that the
low concentration of bisphosphonates, and especially of the
newer more potent ones necessary to produce a pharmacologi￾cal effect, has no significant impact on mineral dissolution and
that their action is therefore cellular. Moreover, structure/ac￾tivity comparisons (42) showed that inhibition of mineral dis￾solution by bisphosphonates does not correlate with pharma￾cological activity, which is due to cellular action.
To summarize bisphosphonate effects at the cellular level,
there is general agreement that they act directly or indirectly
on the osteoclasts. The effect can be on the formation of osteo￾clasts and/or on their activity. A decrease in osteoclast number
can occur either through direct action on osteoclast precursors,
or indirectly by stimulating the osteoblasts to produce an in￾hibitor of osteoclast formation. Osteoclast inactivation is asso￾ciated with bisphosphonate uptake from the bone surface. Fur￾thermore, the bisphosphonates may act by shortening the life
span of the osteoclasts, possibly through apoptosis. At present
it is not known which of the mechanisms, the indirect effect on
osteoclast recruitment and/or survival or the direct effect on
osteoclast activity and/or survival is more important in vivo.
The initial theory that resorption is decreased because of a
physicochemical decrease in mineral dissolution, due to ad￾sorption of the compound on the crystal surface, is no longer
tenable.
Molecular level. The chain of events which leads to osteo￾clast inactivation or decreased formation, following direct or
indirect exposure to a given bisphosphonate, has not yet been
elucidated. The possibilities include either bisphosphonate ac￾tion on a cell surface “receptor” and/or bisphosphonate up￾take by the cell, where it interacts with an enzyme or other
molecule, affecting cellular metabolism. The receptor hypoth￾esis is favored for the osteoblast-mediated effect, since only a
short exposure to low concentrations is needed (29). Candi￾date receptors would include purinergic receptors, based on
(limited) structure homology. One of the signaling pathways
via these receptors includes changes in intracellular calcium.
To date, there is, however, no evidence for detectable activa￾tion of the osteoblast by bisphosphonates via this or any other
signal transduction pathway, such as changes in cyclic nucleo￾tides, inositol triphosphate, intracellular calcium, or others,
which would support the receptor hypothesis. The other possi￾bility is bisphosphonate modulation of cellular functions
through interference with an intracellular biochemical path￾way. This would require cellular uptake of the compounds as
evidenced for various bisphosphonates (36–39). Since the lipid
bilayer of the cell membrane is not readily permeable to bis￾phosphonates, such uptake should occur via fluid pinocytosis
or adsorptive pinocytosis (43). These mechanisms may explain
the selective effects of bisphosphonates on macrophages, in
addition to osteoclasts, manifested by a decrease in prolifera￾tion (28) or as an acute phase response caused in some patients
receiving relatively high doses of aminobisphosphonates intra￾venously (44) and which is thought to act through an increase
in IL-6 release (45).
Recently, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum was
shown to take up bisphosphonates by pinocytosis (46). In these
cells, clodronate, but not other pharmacologically active bis￾phosphonates, was incorporated into adenine nucleotides,
which could potentially explain why this bisphosphonate
sometimes seems to act differently than the other bisphospho￾nates. There was a good correlation between the effect of vari￾ous bisphosphonates on the multiplication of the amoebae and
their effect on bone resorption in vivo. This correlation sug￾gests that this model may help us understand the uptake by
cells and perhaps the intracellular mechanism of action.
It has been known for a long time that bisphosphonates de￾crease acid production of various cells (37). Since proton ex￾trusion into the resorption space is considered of importance
for osteoclast activity, bisphosphonates were investigated as to
their effect on this process. Osteoclasts seeded on bone were
shown to extrude acid by a sodium-independent mechanism
(47), and this process was inhibited by alendronate. The vacu￾olar type proton ATPase appears to be responsible in part for
this extrusion. When this proton pump was assayed in inside￾out osteoclast vesicles in vitro, tiludronate was found to be a
potent inhibitor (48), while other bisphosphonates more po￾tent in vivo were not inhibitory. However, it should be empha￾sized again that the various bisphosphonates do not necessarily
have a common mechanism of action, especially at the molecu￾lar level.
In view of the homology to pyrophosphate, the effect of
bisphosphonates on enzyme systems involving pyrophosphate
or ATP has been examined. Bisphosphonates did not inhibit
alkaline or acid phosphatases (25, 49), which can act as pyro￾phosphatases or, if they did so, only at millimolar concentra￾tions at which the effect could have been due to metal chela￾tion (49). Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine
phosphatase were not inhibited either (25). Only two groups of
enzymes were shown to be inhibited by bisphosphonates:
squalene synthase, a lipid metabolism enzyme which has farne￾syl pyrophosphate as its substrate (50), and protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTP),1
 which control tyrosine phosphorylation

involved in signal transduction pathways (25, 51). Squalene
synthase inhibition would control cholesterol biosynthesis, but
its direct link to the formation of osteoclast ruffled border is
not immediately apparent, although a change in membrane ri￾gidity may be induced, but there is no indication that this effect
is related to the inhibition of bone resorption. Alendronate did
not inhibit farnesyl transferase (unpublished data) which is re￾quired for the membrane binding of many proteins.
The tyrosine phosphatases balance the activity of tyrosine
kinases in signal transduction pathways initiated by growth
factors, insulin, and other stimuli. It is noteworthy that in c-src
“knock-out” mice the osteoclasts are inactive and lack ruffled
border (52) and that dephosphorylation of tyrosine 527 is re￾quired for c-src activation (53). All bisphosphonates examined
so far (alendronate, etidronate, pamidronate, tiludronate) in￾hibit PTPs (54). Their relative potency depends on the specific
PTP examined and on the substrate used. However, the evi￾dence available so far has not identified a specific PTP as a bis￾phosphonate target, and the potency of various bisphospho￾nates in inhibiting the PTPs tested so far (PTPe, PTPs, PTP1B,
and CD45) does not correspond to their pharmacological po￾tency. But the overall in vivo potency could also be influenced
by the distribution of bisphosphonates on the bone surface and
by their cellular uptake in osteoclasts (33,36) or cells of the
mononuclear phagocyte system (28). In view of the involve￾ment of these enzymes in cellular processes associated with cy￾toskeletal function and vesicular traffic, they are a good choice
for possible molecular targets for bisphosphonate action, wor￾thy of further investigation.
In conclusion, although the detailed mechanism of action
of bisphosphonates has not been elucidated, it is clear that at
the tissue level all active bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorp￾tion, bone turnover, and, therefore, bone loss. The effect is due
to a decrease in the generation of new bone remodeling units
and a decrease in the depth of the erosion cavities. At the cel￾lular level, bisphosphonates inactivate osteoclastic bone re￾sorption directly and/or indirectly. They induce the disappear￾ance of osteoclast ruffled border and inhibit proton extrusion.
At the molecular level, tiludronate, but not other bisphospho￾nates, inhibits vacuolar ATPase; several bisphosphonates in￾hibit squalene synthase, and all bisphosphonates tested inhibit
protein tyrosine phosphatase. The link of these effects to the in
vivo action of the respective bisphosphonates remains to be es￾tablished. Further insights into the molecular basis of bisphos￾phonate action could come from the identification of other
molecules, such as receptors, channels, enzymes, or signal
transduction mediators, for which it can be shown that they in￾teract directly with bisphosphonates at pharmacological con￾centrations and are required for bisphosphonate effects on
bone cells.
