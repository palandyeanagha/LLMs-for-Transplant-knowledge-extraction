bowel disease activity but simply reflecting the patient’s sus￾ceptibility to related autoimmune disorders, including anky￾losing spondylitis (AS) and uveitis; and those with an unclear 
relationship to bowel disease activity, including pyoderma 
gangrenosum (PG) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). 
Extraintestinal complications are initiated by the disease itself 
and consequently include micronutrient deficiency, osteopo￾rosis, peripheral neuropathy, nephrolithiasis, and IBD drug-re￾lated side effects.2
 EIMs or extraintestinal complications occur 
in various organs and significantly affect the quality of life of 
patients with IBD (Table 1). Physicians who treat IBD need to 
keep track of the progress and treatment of these EIMs or ex￾traintestinal complications of the disease through multidisci￾plinary approaches. Herein, we will focus on and review the 
pathogenesis and clinical perspectives of EIMs in IBD.

A considerable number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), 
which can present either before or after IBD diagnosis. Unraveling the pathogenic pathways of EIMs in IBD is challenging 
because of the lack of reliable criteria for diagnosis and difficulty in distinguishing EIMs from external pathologies caused by 
drugs or other etiologies. Optimizing treatment can also be difficult. Early diagnosis and management of EIM revolve around 
multidisciplinary teams, and they should have the resources necessary to make and implement appropriate decisions. In ad￾dition, specialists of the affected organs should be trained in IBD treatment. Furthermore, patient awareness regarding the 
extraintestinal symptoms of IBD is of paramount importance for improving patient understanding of disease and health out￾comes. Herein, we review the pathogenesis and clinical perspectives of EIMs in IBD. (Intest Res 2020;18:249-264)

REVIEW
INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including CD and UC, is a 
chronic, intestinal inflammatory disease that is often associat￾ed with the development of various extraintestinal symptoms. 
Extraintestinal symptoms can be divided into 2 groups: ex￾traintestinal manifestations (EIMs) and extraintestinal compli￾cations. EIMs are defined in patients with IBD when an inflam￾matory pathology is located outside the intestine, the patho￾genesis of which depends on the extension/translocation of 
immune pathways from the intestine, is an independent in￾flammatory event sustained by IBD, or shares a common envi￾ronmental or genetic predisposition with IBD.1
 EIMs can be 
divided into 3 categories: EIMs directly related to bowel dis￾ease activity, including episcleritis, erythema nodosum (EN),

agnosis and sex3,4 and is reported to be 23.0% in CD and 24.4% 
in UC, according to data from the National Health Insurance 
System of Korea.3
 Up to 50% of patients with IBD experience 
at least one EIMs, which can develop even before the diagno￾sis of IBD.5
 However, these results of EIMs differ greatly among 
study methods and research designs.
Abdominal pain is a common symptom related to IBD, and 
pain is the principal symptom in IBD.6
 Pain is a longstanding 
problem and can also be seen in EIMs.7
 During disease flares, 
pain is present in 50%–70% of patients with IBD, and the 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these patients was 
reported to be significantly lower in patients suffering from 
pain than in those without pain.6,7
As such, EIMs are a common problem and may significant￾ly impact the quality of life of patients with IBD, requiring spe￾cific treatments depending on the affected organs. Therefore, 
successful management of EIMs is essential for improving the 
quality of life of patients with IBD.
PATHOGENESIS OF EIMs
The pathogenic mechanisms of EIMs have yet to be clearly 
defined. Defining the pathophysiology of an EIM requires sig￾nificant research and consensus due to the lack of consistent 
criteria for diagnosing an EIM and difficulty of distinguishing 
an EIM from extraintestinal complications or a secondary 
EIM caused by drugs. EIMs are considered to be the result of 
an antigen-specific immune response from the intestine to an 
extraintestinal site or an independent inflammatory event that 
is initiated or persisting from covalent genetic or environmen￾tal risk factors in the host, or from IBD (Fig. 1).
1. Dysbiosis of Gut Microbiota and Disrupted Gut 
Barrier in Intestinal Sites
Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) enhance intestinal health, cre￾ating conditions favorable for resistance to pathogenic bacte￾ria and preventing colitis. SCFAs have been found at signifi￾cantly lower levels in IBD patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).8
IBD patients with PsA had a relative decrease in the abundance 
of Coprococcus and Ruminococcus species. Ruminococcus is a 
mucin-degrading bacterium that is especially important for 
maintaining intestinal homeostasis through SCFA production. 
The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL)/
osteoprotegerin (OPG) system may be a regulator of intestinal 
microbiomes, and imbalances through the breakage of RANKL 
in the gut lumen of patients with PsA can promote dissocia￾tion of inflammation to a distal site, such as a joint.8
IBD patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) have an in￾Table 1. Extraintestinal Manifestations and Complications Associated with IBD

creased abundance of the genus Dialister, which is positively 
correlated with disease activity.9
 In addition, microbial activa￾tion in CD with SpA are associated with interleukin-23 (IL-23) 
dependent inflammation.10 CD-SpA-derived Escherichia coli
induced T helper 17 (Th17) cells polarization and made exac￾erbation of colitis or inflammatory arthritis.
Gut dysbiosis in IBD patients with AS induces differentiation 
and activation of group 3 congenital lymphocytes (ILC3s).11
ILC3s are IL-23-responsive immune cells that play a pro-in￾flammatory role in mediating a protective response against 
extracellular bacterial infections. ILC3s have been identified 
in the peripheral blood, synovial fluid, and bone marrow tis￾sues of patients with AS, most of which express intestinal 
homing integrin α4β7. Mucosal vascular addressin cell adhe￾sion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) was highly represented in the 
bone marrow and AS patients’ intestinal high endothelial ve￾nules. In addition, MAdCAM-1 plays a central role in attracting 
ILC3s at the inflammation site of active AS and recirculating 
ILC3s between the gut and inflamed spines.12 In patients with 
IBD, intestinal effector T cells target gut microbial antigens. 
Transporting these antigens to the liver through the portal cir￾culation allows the recruitment of mucosal effector α4β7 posi￾tive T cells through α4β7 MAdCAM-1 interactions. 
Patients with PSC showed gut microbial differentiations 
from those with UC without liver diseases.13 In a Gnotobiotic 
mice model with PSC/UC, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mi￾rabilis and Enterococcus gallinarum were identified from the 
mesenteric lymph nodes of PSC/UC Gnotobiotic mice.14 Dis￾rupted gut barrier by K. pneumonia is associated with bacteri￾al translocation and Th17 priming to the liver. These bacteria

can lead the progression of hepatobiliary tract disease through 
the Th17 response in the colon and liver.
Alterations in the composition and metabolic products of 
the microbiota can affect the production of innate immune 
cells in patients with IBD.15,16 There were significant differenc￾es in the composition of microbiome between HLA-B27+ and 
HLA-B27– siblings as well as healthy controls, indicating that 
genetic background can affect the composition and abun￾dance of microbiomes.
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-specific cells (DP8α TREG 
clones), found only in the chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6)+
 and 
in the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6)+
 fractions of 
CD4CD8α (DP8α) cells, were significantly decreased in the 
blood of patients with IBD.17 These gut recirculating markers 
are expressed in the DP8 cells of the large intestine and remain 
expressed in F. prausnitzii–reactive DP8α cells in the blood, al￾lowing them to move to a specific intestinal position to per￾form their functions. These characteristics can be conveyed by 
the joint expression of CCR6 and CXCR6; the expression of 
CCR6 and CXCR6 also implies homing to other mucosal loca￾tions.
2. Immune Responses in Extraintestinal Sites
Abnormal lymphocyte homing in IBD can explain why EIMs 
are associated with site specific distributions.18 The α4β7 inte￾grin is a lymphocyte receptor for the MAdCAM-1. The interac￾tion between α4β7 and MAdCAM-1 plays an important role in 
regulating lymphocyte homing to mucosal sites.19 Expression 
of MAdCAM-1 is confined to the intestinal tissue, allowing gut 
tropic T cells expressing α4β7 integrin to selectively traffic 
with the intestinal mucosa. Additional tropism for the small 
bowel comes from C-C motif chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25) 
which attracts lymphocytes expressing the CCR9 receptor. T 
cell migration to the small bowel requires integrin α4β719 and 
CCR9.20 Interestingly, homing to the colon requires α4β7 or 
α4β1 but not CCR9.21
Both chemokines and adhesion molecules can promote T 
cell trafficking to extraintestinal sites. The activation and ex￾pansion of effector memory T cells can lead to the induction 
of MAdCAM-1 and CCL25 expression in the liver, thereby pro￾moting the recruitment of CCR9+
α4β7+
 mucosal T cells and 
development of inflammation.22 Upregulation of inflamma￾tion-related adhesion molecules and chemokines also enables 
the capture of effector T cells, facilitating recruitment to sites 
other than extraintestinal sites. IL-6 produced during inflam￾mation promotes the influx of naïve and memory T cells by 
increasing the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(ICAM-1) in high endothelial venules of the reactive lymph 
nodes.23 ICAM-1 can also be upregulated with pre-inflamma￾tory stimuli in response to TNF-α, IL-1β, and interferon-γ.
24
Neutrophils altered by inflammatory cytokines can en￾hance their response upon subsequent activation, referred to 
as “neutrophil priming.”25 Neutrophils in patients with gut in￾flammation are primed to secrete high levels of TNF-α and IL￾1β after stimulation with lipid polysaccharides.26 However, pa￾tients with CD have a defective neutrophil recruitment after 
the introduction of subcutaneous bacteria, which severely de￾lays the subsequent clearance of these bacteria.27 In addition 
to changes in circulating monocytes and macrophages in pa￾tients with IBD, reduced inflammatory cytokine production in 
response to bacterial stimuli has also been reported.27,28 Neu￾trophil-platelet interactions play an important role in the de￾gree of tissue neutrophil infiltration through neutrophil integ￾rins (αLβ2 and αMβ2) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1; how￾ever, neutrophil priming and/or activation in the peripheral 
site are inhibited by sphingosine.29,30 Ceramide synthase 2 
(CerS2) and CerS6 mutually control the aspects of neutrophil 
recruitment to tissues, and chemotaxis is also regulated by 
sphingosine-1-phosphate through IL-8 production. In the gut 
of patients with SpA, IL-23 polarization does not appear to be 
accompanied by Th17 polarization. However, IL-23 can in￾duce gut inflammation and may be associated with the expan￾sion and activation of innate immune cells such as ILC3, γδ T 
cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells.11,31,32 Augment￾ed expression of IL-23R in γ/δ T cells was also associated with 
enhanced IL-17 secretion. Stimulation of γ/δ T cells from SpA 
patients with IL-23 and/or anti-CD3/CD28 strongly induced 
polarization for IL-17 production.
3. Autoantibodies
On the endothelial side, pre-incubation of the synovial sec￾tions with monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 and vascu￾lar adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) showed significant inhibition 
of the binding of small lymphocytes from the IBD gut to the 
joint vessels.33 Small lamina propria lymphocytes isolated 
from the intestine of IBD patients adhered to the synovial ves￾sels using VAP-1 and their endothelial ligands (CD18 & ICAM￾1, and α4β7/α4β1 integrins and vascular cell adhesion mole￾cule 1 [VCAM-1]). VAP-1 also plays a pivotal role in the recruit￾ment and transmigration of lymphocytes via the hepatic sinu￾soidal endothelium, the expression of which is upregulated by 
inflammation.34 VCAM-1 selectively binds lymphocytes thr­

ough integrin α4β1. It also mediates lymphocyte homing to 
extraintestinal sites such as the lung, skin, and central nervous 
systems with chronic inflammation. It is not usually expressed 
by the intestinal venules but can be upregulated in the blood 
vessels during inflammation.35 CCR10 with integrin α4β1 and 
VCAM-1 also mediate the localization of integrin α4β7-nega￾tive plasmablasts to non-intestinal mucosal sites (salivary and 
lacrimal glands and respiratory and urogenital tracts) where 
CCL28 is also expressed. Among the effector and central 
memory T cells, CCR10 is limited to integrin α4β1+
α4β1–
 cuta￾neous lymphocyte antigen+
 skin homing cells (which provide 
T cell attraction to the CCR10 ligand CCL27 expressed in ke￾ratinocytes). Inflammation or mechanical stress in the ex￾traintestinal sites can lead to the recruitment of gut-producing 
effector T cells and further increase the inflammatory pro￾cess.34,36
In addition, molecular mimicry, peptide sequences be￾tween the gut bacteria and host major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) molecules, and reactivation by cross-reactive 
components of microbiomes or host antigens have been re￾ported.37,38
Peptides expressing common epitopes shared by colons 
and extra-colonic organs, autoimmune responses to the iso￾form of tropomyosin (tropomyosin related peptide) expressed 
in the eyes, skin, joints, biliary epithelia, and intestines can 
help clarify the pathogenesis of EIMs.39,40 Bacteria can translo￾cate across the leaky epithelial barriers and cause adaptive 
immune responses that are indistinguishable from bacterial 
epitopes in joints or skin. There is still a lack of clear evidence 
on the role of circulating antibodies or immune complexes in 
the pathogenesis of EIMs.
In a mice model, retina-specific T cells causing human 
blindness due to uveitis received microbial-dependent activa￾tion signals, most likely cross-reactive bacterial antigens.41 This 
result showed that the activation of autoreactive T cells via gut 
microbes may drive uveitis. In another mice model of autoim￾mune uveitis, enhanced leukocytes trafficking between the in￾testine and eyes were observed.42 The antigen specificity of T 
cells responsible for EIMs in humans will require further con￾firmation.
4. Genetics of EIMs
Genetic risk loci for both IBD and EIMs overlap extensively. 
PSC genes and their linked IBD genes are involved in T cell 
apoptosis (UBASH3A, BCL2L11, FOXO1, and IRF8) and the 
Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription 
(JAK/STAT) pathways signaling pathways (SOCS1, JAK2, 
STAT3, and TYK2). In case of AS, T cell apoptosis pathways in￾teract with the IBD genes. The AS-related genes, TAPBPL and 
NPEPPS, function similarly to the AS covalent gene ERAP1 in 
patients with IBD, which is important for both the develop￾ment of AS and IBD. ERAP1 variant K528R associated with 
CD has involved in aberrant peptide production resulting in 
suboptimal peptide MHC I complex.43 The CD risk gene, 
NOD2/CARD15, which encodes a pattern recognition recep￾tor, is also associated with sacroiliitis and uveitis.44,45 STAT4 is 
also responsible for the expansion of Th17 cells activated by 
IL-23, which promotes chronic inflammation in innate and 
adaptive immunity and is considerably associated with the 
development of EIMs involving the joints and eyes in patients 
with IBD.46 However, it is still unknown whether all relevant 
loci contribute specifically to the pathology of EIMs or wheth￾er there are genes that generally cause EIMs by not restricting 
the inflammatory response to specific body compartments. 
Therefore, further research is needed.
CLINICAL ASPECTS OF EIMs
This following section describes the paradigms and tools cur￾rently available in clinical studies of the musculoskeletal/joint, 
skin, eye, vessels, and hepatobiliary EIMs (Table 2).
1. Musculoskeletal/Joint Manifestations
Inflammatory arthrosis of IBD is the most common EIM, with 
a prevalence of 20%–50% for axial inflammation and 5%–20% 
for peripheral arthritis.47 Peripheral arthritis in patients with 
IBD is mainly asymmetric, oligo-articular, and is predomi￾nantly found in CD. IBD-related joint symptoms can be subdi￾vided into non-inflammatory and inflammatory joint pain. 
Arthralgia is a major medical problem in patients with IBD. 
Compared to patients with IBD without arthralgia, non-in￾flammatory joint pain was reported in 16% of patients with a 
significant worsening of their HRQOL determined using the 
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and the Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Questionnaire.48 The current gold standard 
tool for layering SpA is the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Ac￾tivity Score, which can measure the disease activity that may 
be followed over time.49 In general, the prognosis for peripher￾al arthritis is good. The prognosis for axial involvement is less 
favorable and is not related to the prognosis of IBD but to the 
progression of IBD.

2. Skin Manifestations
Diagnoses of skin manifestations are primarily based on clini￾cal examinations, and skin biopsies can help in atypical cases. 
EN is associated with IBD activity, arthralgia, or fatigue. The 
prevalence of EN appears higher in patients with CD than in 
those with UC.50 EN usually appears on the extensor surface of 
the lower extremities, mostly in the anterior tibial region,51 and 
is associated with IBD flares but not always with severity, is 
self-limited, and usually resolves itself without the formation of 
ulcers or scarring.52 The appearance of nodules parallels intes￾tinal activity, which rarely occurs before the onset of IBD or in 
the quiescent phase of IBD. IBD treatment leads to the resolu￾tion of cutaneous lesions. PG can occur anywhere in the body 
but occurs most commonly in the shin and adjacent to sto￾mas. PG usually has a skin trauma known as “pathergy.” This 
trauma might even be minimal, such as a venipuncture. Con￾troversy exists over whether PG coexists with disease activity. 
In this case, treatment can be concentrated on the underlying 
intestinal disease. Patients often show a rapid response, with a 
stiffening of the lesions within 24 hours of treatment.
Due to the absence of specific tests for diagnosing PG, phy￾sicians can determine whether clinical and histopathological 
images are consistent with PG, excluding other pustules or ul￾cerative dermatitis. A further development of assessment tools 
and standardized classifications are needed.
3. Eye Manifestations
The most common ocular EIMs are dry eye, blepharitis, 
episcleritis, or anterior uveitis. Some ocular manifestations in 
IBD can be secondary to treatment and/or effects of the IBD 
itself. Ophthalmic complications usually originate from in￾flammation, but some of these complications may reflect the 
overall disease activity.53 Episcleritis can be unilateral or bilat￾eral and is more common in women. It usually does not need 
specific treatments other than those for the original disease. 
Scleritis is chronic and is characterized by edema and cellular 
infiltration of the scleral tissues. Uveitis is not common but 
can have potentially more serious consequences. It occurs 
acutely or subacutely and is usually very painful. Anterior 
uveitis is also commonly referred to as iritis, which indicates 
pain and photophobia and can be associated with blurred vi￾sion or floaters. The slit-lamp test confirms the diagnosis of an 
ocular EIM. In case of vision impairment, the patient must be 
immediately referred to the ophthalmologist to avoid vision 
loss. 
4. Vascular Manifestations
Cardiovascular manifestations in IBD mostly occur as an im￾mune-related pathogenesis including pericarditis, myocardi￾tis, venous and arterial thromboembolisms, arrhythmias and 
conduction disorders, infective endocarditis, and Takayasu’s 
arteritis. Pericarditis is the most frequent cardiovascular EIM 
in patients with IBD but has not been associated with IBD ac￾tivity.54 The clinical picture of myocarditis or pericarditis relat￾ed to IBD is nonspecific. These patients may have symptoms 
of an acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or arrhythmias 
and may also have cardiogenic shock or sudden death.
If this clinical picture occurs within the first 28 days after 
starting treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid or its derivatives, 
drug toxicity is suspected.55 Because 12-lead electrocardio￾grams and biomarkers of cardiac injury are also nonspecific, 
transthoracic echocardiography, coronary angiography, or 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may offer more 
precise information for all patients with clinical presentations 
suggesting myopericarditis.56 Furthermore, endomyocardial 
biopsies can be considered a gold standard for the diagnosis 
of myocarditis.57
In meta-analysis studies, the risk of arterial thromboembolic 
events or cardiovascular mortality in patients with IBD does 
not increase but is associated with an increase in the risk of 
cardiovascular morbidities from cerebrovascular accidents 
and ischemic heart disease, especially in women.58,59 Lower 
rates of peripheral vascular disease in IBD do not appear to in￾crease the risk of peripheral arterial thromboembolic diseases. 
However, hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for arterial and 
venous thrombosis, is more common in patients with IBD 
than in the general population.60 In addition, an increased risk 
of arterial thrombosis due to systemic inflammation and hy￾percoagulability involves premature atherosclerosis.61
5. Hepatobiliary Manifestations
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with IBD show abnor￾mal hepatic biochemistries.62 PSC is highly correlated with 
IBD, and about 50%–80% of patients with PSC have an ac￾companying IBD.63 Patients with IBD and PSC often have pre￾dominantly right-sided, high-frequency “backwash” ileitis, and 
rectal sparing.64 Patients with UC, when diagnosed with PSC, 
are negatively associated with smoking and older ages.65
Symptoms are intermittent and can be confusing due to the 
underlying IBD symptoms. In patients with IBD, PSC is usual￾ly asymptomatic, which requires an awareness of high clinical 
association. Although typically imaged using magnetic reso-

nance cholangiography and confirmed using endoscopic ret￾rograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), the Crohn’s and 
Colitis Organisation consensus group suggests that ERCP be 
performed only for intervention in stricture dilatation and/or 
if brush cytology specimen sampling is indicated.66
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)/PSC overlapping syndrome is 
seen in UC patients than CD.67 It is suspected that the charac￾teristics of AIH and PSC in the same patient are present, and a 
definitive diagnosis of AIH is required according to the inter￾national AIH group criteria.68
The prevalence of AIH in pediatric IBD patients is 1.6%.69
AIH can be divided into 2 types. AIH type 1 is positive for anti￾nuclear antibodies and/or smooth muscle antibodies, where￾as AIH type 2 is liver/kidney microsomal type 1 and/or anti￾liver cytosol type 1 is positive. Even if antinuclear antibodies 
or smooth muscle antibodies is 1:20 or liver/kidney microso￾mal type 1 is 1:10 in children, it is associated with AIH in chil￾dren.70
Granulomatous hepatitis is a rare EIM of CD. The estimated 
prevalence is less than 1% of IBD. It may manifest fever, alka￾line phosphatase, hepatosplenomegaly. Granulomatous hepa￾titis may be induced by mesalazine and sulfasalazine therapy.71
In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, IBD-specific risk factors 
include intraperitoneal abscesses, fistula disease, colitis sever￾ity, malnutrition, protein loss, and drug use. 
Thiopurine and gallstones are the most common causes of 
acute pancreatitis in patients with IBD, and acute pancreatitis 
caused by thiopurine is generally not complicated and is self￾limiting.72 Most chronic pancreatitis cases in patients with IBD 
are idiopathic, and PSC is a less common cause. Exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency appears to be the most common pan￾creatic symptom in IBD, but its clinical significance remains 
unknown.
TREATMENT FOR EIMs INCLUDING BIOLOGICS 
Optimizing treatments is often challenging. There is lack of 
high-quality evidence to support the most commonly used 
treatment methods for EIMs and other treatment strategies 
that can complement them. Treatment of EIMs should be 
based on the severity of symptoms and their association with 
IBD activity. The primary goal is symptom control and preser￾vation of mobility and function. In some cases, symptomatic 
treatment with physiotherapy may be sufficient (Table 3).
1. Joint Manifestations
Treatment of IBD-related arthropathy is based on SpA studies, 
predominantly AS. Patients with axial SpA should be co-man￾aged by rheumatologists because of the potentially disruptive 
disease progress. Severity of type 1 arthritis usually runs paral￾lel to IBD activity, and type 2 arthritis usually requires long￾term treatment. Therefore, effective treatment of underlying

gut inflammation is important for the treatment of peripheral 
arthritis.
Intensive physiotherapy may be helpful in AS, and NSAIDs 
should be used for a short time period due to their potential to 
activate underlying IBD.73 Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors such 
as etoricoxib and celecoxib may be safer and have a lower risk 
of disease flare than conventional NSAIDs.74 Sulfasalazine, 
methotrexate (MTX), and azathioprine are generally ineffec￾tive or only slightly effective in the treatment of AS. However, 
sulfasalazine is effective in treating patients with peripheral 
joint disease, especially those with a short disease duration.75
Sulfasalazine is an optional treatment in patients with SpA 
and peripheral disease and may be effective for large joint ar￾thropathy.76 MTX and azathioprine are considered marginally 
effective in the treatment of peripheral arthropathy. For pa￾tients with intolerance, unresponsiveness, or poor response to 
NSAIDs, anti-TNF therapy is the preferred treatment because 
of the limited efficacy of MTX and thiopurine.77
2. Skin Manifestations
Treatment of EN consists of treating the underlying IBD, and 
systemic steroids may be helpful. For patients with resistant or 
frequent relapses, immunomodulators and anti-TNF therapy 
can be considered alone or in combination.78
PG treatment strategies are the same between IBD and non￾IBD patients. Systemic corticosteroids are considered as the 
first-line treatment, and oral or intravenous tacrolimus with 
oral cyclosporines may be considered for refractory cases.79,80
Anti-TNF therapy represents a new and effective treatment 
option for medically refractory PG cases.
3. Eye Manifestations
Due to the potential loss of vision, ophthalmologists must 
evaluate each suspected case to confirm the diagnosis and 
help guide the treatment. Dry eyes may be treated with topical 
lubricants. Episcleritis may be self-limiting and usually re￾sponds to underlying IBD treatment along with topical 
NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.81 Uveitis requires urgent consul￾tations with ophthalmologists and needs prompt treatment 
because of the risk of vision loss. Treatment usually consists of 
steroids. Other therapies (azathioprine, MTX, or anti-TNF 
therapy) have been discussed only for resistant cases.82
4. Vascular Manifestations
Because thromboembolism occurs due to multifactorial 
causes and acquired risk factors, precautions (hydration, cor￾rection of vitamin deficiencies, and wearing gradual compres￾sion stockings) can help prevent venous thromboembolisms 
(VTEs). Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is recommend￾ed for high-risk patients (hospitalized due to an active phase 
or surgery) with VTEs.83 There is still no evidence for the pro￾phylaxis of active disease in outpatients with IBD. However, 
because many VTEs occur in outpatients with IBD, guidelines 
are required for VTE prophylaxis when patients with IBD have 
acutely or chronically active diseases. Acute deep vein throm￾boses and pulmonary embolisms are treated using anticoagu￾lants according to international guidelines. Low-molecular￾weight heparin is commonly used, and low-dose unfraction￾ated heparin or fondaparinux can be used as an alternative 
option. Long-term treatment includes oral anticoagulants 
such as vitamin K antagonists (acenocoumarol, warfarin, flu￾indione) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, 
such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.
5. Hepatobiliary Manifestations
Ursodeoxycholic acid improves abnormal liver function tests 
and is widely used in patients with PSC, but prognosis improve￾ments are controversial. Other therapeutic agents (steroid, cy￾closporine, tacrolimus, MTX, or anti-TNF therapy) still lack ev￾idence for improvements in clinical endpoints.84 ERCPs play a 
role in the management of biliary strictures and should be 
performed after antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with PSC. It 
can reduce the risk of cholangitis, bacteremia, and septicemia 
after ERCP.85 Patients with PSC and end-stage liver disease 
should be evaluated to determine whether liver transplanta￾tions should be performed according to the standard guide￾lines. PSC has a significantly greater risk for the development 
of colorectal dysplasia and carcinoma in patients with UC.86
Therefore, surveillance colonoscopies with target biopsies are 
recommended at the diagnosis and at every 1–2 years there￾after.87
Immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone alone or in 
combination with azathioprine is the main therapeutic regi￾men of AIH and has been to show the prolongation of life ex￾pectancy.67 In granulomatous hepatitis, corticosteroids and 
immunosuppressive drugs are used for treatment.
6. Biologics and Probiotics for EIMs
Biologics have been tested to prove their efficacy in the treat￾ment of EIMs as well as IBD. Clinical benefits of infliximab or 
adalimumab may not be limited to gut treatment effects but 
may extend to improve EIMs.88 Infliximab and adalimumab 

Jung Min Kim, et al. • Pathogenesis and clinical perspectives of EIMs in IBD
258 www.irjournal.org
Silvio Danese, et al. • iSTART consensus recommendations
therapy also have potential beneficial effects on metabolic 
bone diseases, hematologic diseases, or vascular EIMs.88 How￾ever, anti-TNF treatments can cause paradoxical cutaneous 
inflammations, which are considered a class drug effect, and 
are generally reversible upon drug transition or discontinua￾tion. This paradoxical cutaneous inflammation manifests itself 
or appears in most cases as psoriasis, which accounts for why 
anti-TNF-α drug use is increasingly recognized as a cause of 
drug-induced skin lesions.89 Paradoxical psoriasis skin lesions 
are characterized by selective overexpression of type I inter￾feron, skin accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
(pDCs), and reduced T cell counts.90 Anti-TNF-α treatment 
prolongs the production of type 1 interferons by pDC by in￾hibiting pDC maturation. Type I interferon overexpression re￾sults in a skin phenotype of paradoxical psoriasis, indepen￾dent of T cells, unlike classical psoriasis. TNF-α inhibition may 
reduce the accumulation of Th1 and Th17 cells at the site of 
inflammation but may induce compensatory expansion at 
other locations, resulting in skin lesions.91
The role of vedolizumab in EIM treatment has not been de￾fined yet. Vedolizumab inhibits the binding of α4β7+ integrins 
to the intestinal mucosal cell adhesion molecule (MAd￾CAM-1) but not to VCAM-1.92 The binding mechanism seems 
to be selective for cutaneous intestinal lymphocyte migration. 
In contrast, lymphocyte migration by VCAM-1 is unaffected. 
Nevertheless, the overlapping binding behavior of α4β7 with 
MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 may be due to partly different affin￾ities.92,93 According to these results, vedolizumab has no direct 
therapeutic effect on cutaneous EIMs and can play a role in 
EIM management by treating disease activity in EIMs that 
parallels IBD.94 In a systematic review, vedolizumab was sug￾gested to reduce the incidence of new EIMs but also be effec￾tive in the treatment of preexisting EIMs (particularly PSC, 
rheumatic and cutaneous manifestations).95
Data on other biologicals are limited. Ustekinumab is a fully 
human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks the IL￾12/23 p40 subunit. IL-12 and IL-23 are associated with adap￾tive immune responses, and blocking IL-12/IL-23 helps im￾prove chronic inflammatory conditions. Ustekinumab has 
been reported for the management of cutaneous and joint 
EIMs (psoriasis, PsA).96,97 In addition, it is effective for the treat￾ment of anti-TNF antibody-related paradoxical cutaneous in￾flammation.98 However, paradoxical arthralgic or cutaneous 
manifestations have also been reported.99,100 In addition, it did 
not reduce the occurrence of new EIMs.101 Therefore, usteki￾numab requires additional safety and efficacy evidence from 
randomized controlled trials and open-label, real-world co￾horts. Ustekinumab will be an important treatment option in 
EIMs and IBD because it is superior to vedolizumab in terms 
of overall efficacy, rapid onset, and efficacy in small intestine 
disease.
Tofacitinib is a selective JAK inhibitor and the first oral med￾ication approved for use in treating moderate-to-severe UC. 
Its efficacy of treating cutaneous EIMs has been reported. 
STAT3 was significantly upregulated in PG/EN compared to 
psoriasis and revealed potential benefits from JAK inhibition 
in these patients.94,102 In a double-blind, head-to-head, non-in￾feriority, randomized controlled trial in patients with rheuma￾toid arthritis who had insufficient response to MTX treatment, 
combination therapy with tofacitinib and MTX showed simi￾lar efficacy to that with adalimumab and MTX, and tofacitinib 
monotherapy was shown to be inferior to either combina￾tion.103 Because tofacitinib is expected to be free of anti-drug 
antibodies due to its low molecular weight, it results in a rapid 
therapeutic effect in patients with acute severe UC. Further 
studies on the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy 
with tofacitinib and other drugs are needed. In addition, there 
is a need to compare the efficacy and side-effects of upadaci￾tinib and tofacitinib, which are selective JAK1 inhibitors.
Data on probiotics for EIMs are limited. Several studies sug￾gested that the use of probiotics has a beneficial effect for cu￾taneous or arthralgic EIMs but requires further confirmation 
from randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews eval￾uating the effects of probiotics on EIMs.104,105
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING 
THE DISEASE COURSE AND PRINCIPLES TO BE 
APPLIED TO TREATMENT
Physicians should always consider EIMs in the management 
of patients with IBD. Early diagnosis and treatment can pre￾vent permanent tissue destruction and the development of 
complications in patients with IBD with developing EIMs. Di￾agnostic delay is considered a risk factor for the development 
of EIM complications and abdominal surgery.106 Uveitis can 
result in visual impairment if the diagnosis is delayed. Due to 
the diagnostic delay accompanying these inflammatory con￾ditions, the need for proper approaches and tools that can 
quickly provide accurate and viable information is further em￾phasized. Sex, age, ethnicity, geography, socioeconomic sta￾tus, duration, and extension of disease, disease activity, and a 
history of medications are associated with the diagnoses of

<doi> • <doi 1>
EIMs. Genetic factors and dysbiosis of gut microbiomes also 
play an important role in identifying EIMs. Physicians should 
be careful because specific features of the clinical presenta￾tions may signal the possibility of future EIMs. Screening and 
surveillance of EIMs are difficult for physicians in only one 
specialty to include in their treatment protocols. Therefore, it 
is necessary to follow-up with multidisciplinary care. Educat￾ing patients on EIMs and their complications will improve the 
effectiveness of medications and follow-ups. However, re￾search has shown that certain EIMs, such as VTEs, PSCs, and 
nephrolithiasis, may be less emphasized in patient educa￾tion.107 Patients’ perception of thromboembolisms or cardio￾vascular EIMs can have a significant impact on the associated 
morbidity and mortality. VTE has a higher incidence in pa￾tients with IBD than in the general population, and IBD dis￾ease activity is associated with an increased risk of VTE.108
However, only 12% of patients were aware that the risk of VTE 
in the outpatient environment was high and less than half of 
the patients were convinced that they recognized the signs 
and symptoms of deep vein thromboses and pulmonary em￾bolisms,107 indicating a need to reconsider the awareness of 
EIMs in patients with IBD.
The role of mobile applicable for the self-management of 
IBD by patients will continue to increase by providing a more 
efficient, effective, and good quality healthcare system at low￾er costs.109 Daily monitoring of UC through TrueColours UC 
improved UC management while also reducing the burden 
placed on individual and healthcare services.110 These applica￾tions can not only remotely monitor patients via electronic 
patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) or device-gener￾ated data (such as activity trackers) but also improves patient 
engagement.111 The goal of recent IBD therapies is moving to￾ward a therapeutic-targeted strategy using PROs, biomarkers 
of inflammation, and mucosal healing to optimize therapeu￾tics and should also be used for the treatment of EIMs.
CONCLUSIONS
For EIMs of IBD, new mechanisms are being uncovered in a 
number of fields, including immunology, microbiology, and 
genetics, and can reveal a wide range of therapeutic targets. It 
is fundamentally important to ensure proper diagnosis and 
management of EIMs, which can often result in a much more 
debilitating and lower quality of life than actual IBD. Better pa￾tient images require new tools to monitor inflammation from 
various angles, and managements for complex and diverse 
EIMs should be discussed, treated, and tracked through multi￾disciplinary care. In addition to establishing the required diag￾nosis and treatment process, patients should be encouraged 
to participate more actively in the various stages of medical 
care, measurements, implementations, and evaluations of the 
quality of their care.
