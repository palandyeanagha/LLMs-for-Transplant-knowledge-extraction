ABSTRACT
HELLP syndrome and the less common acute fatty liver of
pregnancy (AFL) are unpredictable, life-threatening complica￾tions of pregnancy. The similarities in their clinical and labora￾tory presentations are often challenging for the obstetrician
when making a differential diagnosis. Both diseases are char￾acterised by microvesicular steatosis of varying degrees of se￾verity. A specific risk profile does not exist for either of the en￾tities. Genetic defects in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
and multiple pregnancy are considered to be common predis￾posing factors. The diagnosis of AFL is based on a combination
of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. The Swansea cri￾teria have been proposed as a diagnostic tool for orientation.
HELLP syndrome is a laboratory diagnosis based on the triad
of haemolysis, elevated aminotransferase levels and a platelet
count < 100 G/l. Generalised malaise, nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain are common symptoms of both diseases,
making early diagnosis difficult. Clinical differences include a
lack of polydipsia/polyuria in HELLP syndrome, while jaundice
is more common and more pronounced in AFL, there is a low￾er incidence of hypertension and proteinuria, and patients
with AFL may develop encephalopathy with rapid progression
to acute liver failure. In contrast, neurological symptoms such
as severe headache and visual disturbances are more promi￾nent in patients with HELLP syndrome. In terms of laboratory
findings, AFL can be differentiated from HELLP syndrome by
the presence of leucocytosis, hypoglycaemia, more pro￾nounced hyperbilirubinemia, an initial lack of haemolysis and
thrombocytopenia < 100 G/l, as well as lower antithrombin
levels < 65% and prolonged prothrombin times. While HELLP
syndrome has a fluctuating clinical course with rapid exacer￾bation within hours or transient remissions, AFL rapidly pro￾gresses to acute liver failure if the infant is not delivered im￾mediately. The only causal treatment for both diseases is im￾mediate delivery. Expectant management between 24 + 0
and 33 + 6 weeks of gestation is recommended for HELLP syn￾drome, but only in cases where the mother can be stabilised

Introduction
Pregnancy-specific liver disorders include intrahepatic cholestasis
of pregnancy (ICP), HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of preg￾nancy (AFL). ICP is the most common, with a geographically-de￾pendent prevalence of between 0.3 and 5.6% [1], followed by
HELLP syndrome with a prevalence of 0.5–0.9% [2] and AFL with
a prevalence of 0.005–0.01% [3].
ICP is defined as a reversible form of reduced bile secretion
with cholestasis. HELLP syndrome is considered a severe manifes￾tation of pre-eclampsia (not a disease in its own right) and
presents with a typical triad of laboratory findings consisting of
haemolysis, pathologically elevated aminotransferases and a
platelet count of < 100 G/l [4]. As hypertension and proteinuria
are not present in up to 15% of cases with HELLP syndrome [5],
the AWMF guideline 015/018 published in 2019 [6] defines HELLP
syndrome as a constellation of laboratory findings typically occur￾ring in pregnancy, often associated with pre-eclampsia. AFL is
characterised by acute liver disfunction with progression to fulmi￾nant liver failure caused by pronounced, centrilobular, microvesic￾ular steatosis [7].
As its main symptoms are excruciating pruritus (typically worst
in the palms and soles) in the late 2nd and the 3rd trimester of
pregnancy and elevated bile acid levels (≥ 11 µmol/l), it is usually
easy to distinguish ICP from HELLP syndrome and AFL. However,
the similarities in clinical and laboratory findings between HELLP
syndrome and AFL can pose a significant challenge when making
a differential diagnosis and may lead to delays in obtaining the
correct diagnosis. As both diseases are acute, life-threatening
complications of pregnancy, rapid diagnosis followed by immedi￾ate treatment is of decisive prognostic importance. The common
features and differences in these two entities are therefore de￾scribed below.
Predisposing Factors
There is no specific risk profile for either of the two diseases. It is
still unknown whether pre-existing liver disease increases the risk
[5, 8].
HELLP syndrome in a previous pregnancy is considered a pre￾disposing factor for the occurrence of HELLP syndrome in a subse￾quent pregnancy [2], this does not apply to AFL (individual cases,
[9]).
According to epidemiological studies [10], nulliparity is a pre￾disposing factor for AFL; in hypertensive diseases of pregnancy,
nulliparity is a predisposing factor for pre-eclampsia but not for
HELLP syndrome [11].
Multiple pregnancy is significantly more common in both dis￾orders compared to uncomplicated singleton pregnancies: preva￾lence of HELLP syndrome: 0.2% of singleton pregnancies, 0.9–
1.4% of twin pregnancies, 2.1–10.5% with triplets; percentage of
all HELLP syndromes: 10.3–15.5% (overview in [7]). The preva￾and there is no evidence of foetal compromise. The maternal
mortality rate for HELLP syndrome in developed countries is
approximately 1%, while the rate for AFL is 1.8–18%. Perinatal
mortality rates are 7–20% and 15–20%, respectively. While
data on the long-term impact of AFL on the health of mother
and child is still insufficient, HELLP syndrome is associated
with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular, metabolic
and neurological diseases in later life.
ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
HELLP-Syndrom und die seltenere akute Schwangerschafts￾fettleber (AFL) sind unvorhersehbare, lebensbedrohliche
Komplikationen in der Schwangerschaft. Klinische und labor￾chemische Gemeinsamkeiten stellen den Geburtshelfer häu￾fig vor eine differenzialdiagnostische Herausforderung. Bei
beiden Erkrankungen besteht eine mikrovesikuläre Steatose
unterschiedlicher Ausprägung. Ein spezifisches Risikoprofil ist
für beide Entitäten bisher nicht bekannt. Als gemeinsame prä￾disponierende Faktoren gelten genetische Defekte in der mi￾tochondrialen Fettsäureoxidation sowie Mehrlingsschwanger￾schaften. Die Diagnose AFL wird aus der Kombination kli￾nischer Symptome und laborchemischer Befunde gestellt,
die Swansea-Kriterien stellen dabei eine diagnostische Orien￾tierung dar. Das HELLP-Syndrom ist eine laborchemische Diag￾nose aus der Trias Hämolyse, erhöhte Transaminasen und
Thrombozytopenie < 100 G/l. Allgemeines Krankheitsgefühl,
Übelkeit, Erbrechen und Abdominalschmerzen sind gemein￾same Symptome beider Erkrankungen, die eine frühe Diagno￾sestellung erschweren. Klinische Unterschiede bestehen in
der beim HELLP-Syndrom fehlenden Polydipsie/Polyurie und
dem bei AFL häufigeren und ausgeprägteren Ikterus, dem sel￾teneren Auftreten von Hypertonie und Proteinurie sowie in der
Entwicklung einer Enzephalopathie bei zunehmendem Leber￾versagen. Beim HELLP-Syndrom stehen neurologische Symp￾tome wie starke Kopfschmerzen und Visusstörungen im Vor￾dergrund. Laborchemisch ist die AFL durch die Leukozytose,
die Hypoglykämie, die ausgeprägtere Hyperbilirubinämie, die
initial fehlende Hämolyse und Thrombozytopenie < 100 G/l,
die Verminderung der Antithrombin-Spiegel < 65% und die
Verlängerung der Prothrombinzeit vom HELLP-Syndrom abzu￾grenzen. Während das HELLP-Syndrom in Schüben mit passa￾geren Remissionen verlaufen kann, geht die AFL, sofern keine
rasche Entbindung erfolgt, in ein akutes Leberversagen über.
Die einzige kausale Therapie beider Erkrankungen ist die un￾verzügliche Entbindung. Beim HELLP-Syndrom wird zwischen
der 24 + 0–33 + 6 SSW ein exspektatives Vorgehen empfoh￾len, sofern die Mutter stabilisierbar ist und keine fetale Ge￾fährdung besteht. Die mütterliche Letalität beträgt beim
HELLP-Syndrom in den Industrieländern ca. 1%, bei der AFL
1,8–18%, die perinatale Mortalität 7–20% bzw. 15–20%.
Während bei der AFL die Langzeitauswirkungen auf Mutter
und Kind bisher nicht geklärt sind, muss beim HELLP-Syndrom
mit einem erhöhten Risiko für kardiovaskuläre, metabolische
und neurologische Erkrankungen im späteren Leben gerech￾net werden.

lence of twin pregnancies in cases with AFL is 7.1–28.6%, which is
also significantly higher [7, 10, 12].
Male foetal gender, confirmed in 70% of cases, is a predispos￾ing factor for AFL [12].
Being underweight (BMI < 20) is considered a predisposing fac￾tor for AFL (increasing the risk 1.4-fold, [10, 12]), while obesity
(BMI ≥ 30) tends to be a predisposing factor for pre-eclampsia/
HELLP syndrome.
In 20–40% of cases with AFL, patients have concomitant pre￾eclampsia, and in up to 20% of cases patients have concomitant
HELLP syndrome [13, 14].
Autosomal recessive disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid be￾ta-oxidation affecting the mother and the child may be important
in this context, particularly deficiencies in mitochondrial trifunc￾tional protein (MTP) and its alpha subunit long-chain 3-hydroxy￾acyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD, overview in [15]). Foetal LCHAD
deficiency was confirmed in around 20% of cases with AFL [10],
most commonly the mutation 1528 G → C in exon 15 [16]. LCHAD
catalyses the penultimate step in the mitochondrial beta-oxida￾tion of long-chain fatty acids. Decreased maternal and placental
fatty acid catabolism leads to an accumulation of 3-hydroxy fatty
acid intermediates in the maternal circulation, leading to hepato￾toxicity; 50–70% of mothers with LCHAD-deficient foetuses de￾velop a maternal liver disorder including AFL [17]. Infants with
homozygous LCHAD deficiency have a 38% mortality rate within
3 months of the diagnosis due to severe hypoglycaemia and liver
failure [18]. Testing for LCHAD deficiency is part of neonatal
screening in Germany.
But there is also an association with pre-eclampsia and HELLP
syndrome. Heterozygous mothers of LCHAD-deficient infants
have a 77% risk of developing AFL or HELLP syndrome [19].
Clinical Symptoms, Complications and Course
Both disorders predominantly present between the 28th–36th
week of gestation (median time of presentation for HELLP syn￾drome is week 34 of gestation; [5], median time of presentation
for AFL is week 36 of gestation [10, 12]), rarely before week 22.
In 7–30% of cases, HELLP syndrome occurs up to 48 (72) hours
post partum [20]. In the largest prospective study to date, the di￾agnosis of AFL was made postnatally in 15 out of 57 cases [10].
HELLP syndrome is characterised by a classic triad of laboratory
findings, consisting of haemolysis, elevated aminotransferase lev￾els and thrombocytopenia < 100 G/l; this is considered diagnostic
proof of disease. Currently, a diagnosis of AFL is made based on
clinical symptoms and laboratory findings (previously: liver biop￾sy). The Swansea criteria provide a diagnostic orientation [21]
and are summarised in ▶ Table 1. After excluding other liver func￾tion disorders (particularly HELLP syndrome), at least 6 of the cri￾teria must be present. In a study of 24 patients, the sensitivity of
this method was reported to be 100%, the specificity was 57%,
the positive predictive value was 85% and the negative predictive
value was 100% [22]. However, the Swansea criteria are still a mat￾ter of controversial debate [10, 12, 15]. Firm evidence that taking
these criteria into account will result in earlier diagnoses of AFL is
still lacking [15]; around 40% of pregnant women with AFL (later
confirmed by liver biopsy) in accordance with the Swansea criteria
also met the criteria for HELLP syndrome [22].
The common clinical symptoms at the beginning of both disor￾ders such as general malaise, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain are rather unspecific. In HELLP syndrome, upper abdominal
pain/epigastric pain is considered clinically indicative, while in
AFL abdominal pain is not unambiguously localised (▶ Table 2).
Polydipsia/polyuria is not present in HELLP syndrome; depending
on the severity of HELLP syndrome, oliguria is more likely to be a
presenting symptom as a sign of renal dysfunction. Hypertension
and proteinuria are less common in AFL, occurring in 20–40% of
cases with AFL, compared to a prevalence of 85% in patients with
HELLP syndrome (overview in [7]), although 12–18% of cases with
HELLP syndrome do not have hypertension, 14% do not have pro￾teinuria, and neither hypertension nor proteinuria was found in up
to 15% of these women [2, 5].
The presentation of encephalopathy caused by elevated am￾monia levels in the blood ranges from initial sleep disturbances/
slight confusion to strong disorientation, flapping tremor and co￾matose state. In contrast, neurological symptoms such as strong
headache (33–61%) and visual disturbances (10–20% of cases)
predominate in HELLP syndrome [5, 23].
With an incidence of 27–38,6% [10, 12], ascites is more com￾mon in AFL than in HELLP syndrome where the reported incidence
ranges from 4–11% [2]; subcapsular liver haematoma is more
common in HELLP syndrome (0.9–1.6%) than AFL (individual
cases). Liver rupture occurs in around 1% of cases with HELLP syn￾drome [20], while it has only been reported in individual cases
with AFL [24, 25].
In the study by Chen et al. [12] the rate of acute pancreatitis,
which is associated with an unfavourable prognosis, was 13.6% in
patients with AFL, while the rate of acute pancreatitis in severe

pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome reported in the observational
study by Sang et al. [26] was 1.2%.
Gastrointestinal bleeding is more common in patients with AFL
(▶ Table 2); it only occurs in individual cases with HELLP syndrome
as an initial manifestation of the disease caused by pronounced
coagulopathy [27].
The incidence of lung oedema varies depending on the respec￾tive disease (▶ Table 2). Coagulopathy (prolonged prothrombin
time and aPTT) is present in up to 87% of cases with AFL [10]. With
progressive liver failure, coagulopathy in women with AFL is a con￾sequence of reduced synthesis of coagulation factors produced in
the liver. Manifest coagulopathy with disseminated intravascular
coagulation (Quick, PT, aPTT) in patients with HELLP syndrome is
rare and is the result of pronounced DIC/disseminated intravascu￾lar coagulation in patients with severe disease progression.
Thrombocytopenia caused by the sequestration of platelets in
the peripheral circulation due to microangiopathy is always
present.
Laboratory Investigations and Diagnostic
Procedures
HELLP syndrome is a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Hae￾molysis accompanied by decreased haptoglobin levels is found in
95–97% of cases, increased total bilirubin levels in 47–62% and
fragmented erythrocytes in peripheral blood smear in 54–88% of
patients [2, 5, 23]. Despite the presence of anaemia, haemoglobin
levels may still be within normal ranges due to haemoconcentra￾tion (reduced plasma volume).
Signs of haemolysis are rare in manifestations of AFL and usu￾ally only occur in the context of multi-organ failure.
Hyperbilirubinemia is more common and more pronounced
with AFL (elevated direct conjugated bilirubin levels due to intra￾hepatic cholestasis) than in HELLP syndrome where indirect, un￾conjugated bilirubin levels are elevated due to haemolysis (over￾view in [28]).
Although determining the haptoglobin levels (acute-phase
protein synthesised in the liver) might be useful for diagnostic dif￾ferentiation of the two entities, there exist currently no studies on
haptoglobin levels in AFL.
Aminotransferase levels are elevated in both disorders,
although this increase is usually more pronounced in AFL than in
HELLP syndrome.
Hypoglycaemia and leucocytosis are typical signs of AFL which
do not occur with HELLP syndrome.
Thrombocytopenia < 100 G/l is a necessary criterion of HELLP
syndrome; it is usually not detected as a manifestation of AFL but
develops as a secondary symptom in the context of DIC. In non￾bleeding pregnant women, a lack of thrombocytopenia combined
with reduced antithrombin < 65% indicates AFL; the reduction in
antithrombin levels is significantly less pronounced in HELLP syn￾drome [7].
Increased serum creatinine is more common and more pro￾nounced in AFL than in HELLP syndrome.
Prolonged clotting times (INR, PT, aPTT) occur significantly
more often in AFL than in HELLP syndrome (see above). Increased
ammonia levels and elevated lactic and amino acid levels in blood
indicating mitochondrial damage are typical for AFL [29].
Liver ultrasound should be a standard procedure in patients
with HELLP syndrome to exclude subcapsular liver haematoma/
liver rupture. In patients with AFL, changes found on ultrasound
such as brightness or fatty infiltrations of the liver are unspecific
and do not point at a specific diagnosis (overview in [15]).
Liver biopsy: Formerly the gold standard for the diagnosis of
AFL, it is now only carried out in unclear cases where the clinical
and laboratory findings do not permit diagnosis [15, 30]. As there
is a significant risk of bleeding in cases with coagulopathy, biop￾sies in such cases should not be carried out percutaneously but
should use a transjugular approach [15]. Liver biopsy is not indi￾cated in HELLP syndrome. Microvesicular steatosis is a morpholog-

ical sign in both AFL and HELLP syndrome [31, 32], although in
contrast to AFL, fibrin deposition in the liver sinusoids is found in
HELLP syndrome [33].
Overall, the morphological findings of a liver biopsy are in￾appropriate for obtaining a differential diagnosis [7, 15].
Course of Disease
In up to 46% of cases, HELLP syndrome manifests as episodic ex￾acerbations and transient remissions [34], but the syndrome can
become acute within hours, with a risk of life-threatening compli￾cations and the development of DIC [5].
To date, there are no reports of spontaneous remission of AFL
prior to delivery of the infant [35]. The characteristic course is a
progressive course to acute liver failure within 1 (2) weeks, which
is characterised by increasing jaundice (this only occurs in 5% of
cases with HELLP syndrome), hypoglycaemia, development of co￾agulopathy, ascites/pleural effusions, encephalopathy and acute
kidney failure in up to 90% of affected women (up to 8% of pa￾tients with HELLP syndrome) (▶ Table 2). In a recent study by
Chen et al. (n = 44), the incidence of multi-organ failure in AFL
was 38.6%; the reason cited was the delay in referring these preg￾nant women to a perinatal centre [12]. The latency period be￾tween making the diagnosis and delivery of the infant also has an
impact on prognosis of women with acute HELLP syndrome [5,
36].
After the birth, clinical and laboratory findings usually return to
normal ranges within 7–10 days in both diseases [5, 15]. However,
in patients with AFL there is a significant negative correlation be￾tween hyperbilirubinemia, reduced total protein, thrombocytope￾nia and prolonged thrombin time [12, 37]. In patients with HELLP
syndrome, no platelet increase within 98 hours is considered to in￾dicate severe disease with a risk of multi-organ failure [38].
Therapeutic Approach
As AFL und HELLP syndrome are incalculable life-threatening com￾plications, patients should be treated in a perinatal centre with a
neonatal intensive care unit.
Terminating the pregnancy is considered the only “causal”
therapy for both disorders. With AFL, there is no spontaneous re￾mission of disease prior to termination of the pregnancy [35]. In
patients with HELLP syndrome, acute exacerbation or recurrent
relapses without a definitive “cure” can also make it necessary to
terminate the pregnancy. Given the course of AFL and its progres￾sion to acute liver failure irrespective of gestational age, rapid de￾livery is required [39]. The Italian Association for the Study of the
Liver (AISF) supports terminating the pregnancy at the latest
within one week from the manifestation of symptoms [3]. For pa￾tients with HELLP syndrome, conservative management in a peri￾natal centre is possible between GW 24 + 0 and GW 33 + 6 if the
mother is stable and the foetus is not compromised [6]. It is im￾portant to monitor mother and foetus for any criteria requiring
immediate termination of the pregnancy for foetal (e.g. patholog￾ical CTG/Doppler findings) or maternal indications (such as in￾creasing renal failure, acute lung oedema, signs of DIC, placental
abruption, persistent severe abdominal pain, sudden CNS symp￾toms or eclamptic seizure) [6]. After 34 + 0 weeks of gestation,
immediate delivery is recommended for patients with HELLP syn￾drome [6].
For both entities, initial treatment consists of stabilising the
mother: in patients with AFL this will include supportive measures
such as increasing the fluid intake and correction of metabolic ac￾idosis, electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycaemia and coagulopathy
[35]; in patients with HELLP syndrome stabilisation includes the
administration of antihypertensive drugs and anticonvulsant pro￾phylaxis/treatment with magnesium sulphate; the administration
of glucocorticoids for antenatal lung maturation before < 34 + 0
weeks of gestation is mandatory [6].
Plasmapheresis after the birth has been successfully carried
out in individual cases with severe course of disease/life-threaten￾ing complications [40–42]. According to a meta-analysis by Wang
et al. [43], delivery by Caesarean section significantly decreased
maternal mortality in cases with AFL compared to vaginal deliv￾ery/induced labour, reducing maternal mortality by 44% (RR
0.56; 95% CI: 0.41–0.76) and also reducing perinatal mortality
(RR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38–0.71). Patients with acute HELLP syn￾drome, particularly cases with an unripe cervix remote from term,
should be delivered by Caesarean section [5].
Liver transplantation may be a last resort for individual patients
with AFL, particularly if their liver function continues to deterio￾rate, or for patients with encephalopathy and elevated lactic acid
levels, concomitant sepsis or hypoxic/ischaemic liver damage
[13]. For patients with HELLP syndrome, liver rupture with exten￾sive organ damage may be an indication for liver transplantation
[44].
Prognosis
While in the 1980s, maternal mortality for AFL was still around
85%, advances in intensive care over the last 20 years, early diag￾nosis due to increased awareness of the disorders, and immediate
delivery has reduced this rate since the beginning of the millen￾nium to 10–15% [10, 45]. In the largest epidemiological study
(n = 57), maternal mortality was only 1.8% [10], although the rate
reported in another large study from China (n = 44) was 18.2%.
This comparatively high rate of maternal mortality was predomi￾nantly caused by delays in referring the pregnant woman to a peri￾natal centre [12]. Causes of death from AFL are the consequences
of liver/multi-organ failure. Maternal mortality rates from HELLP
syndrome are currently around 1% in developed countries but
can be as high as 30% in developing countries [23]. The leading
cause of maternal death from HELLP syndrome is intracerebral
haemorrhage in 26–64% of cases; DIC/multi-organ failure, hepat￾ic bleeding or acute kidney failure are less common causes (over￾view in [46]).
Perinatal mortality from AFL ranges from 9–23% [3, 15] and
from 7–20% in patients with HELLP syndrome [23].
The average risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy is 7%
(4–19%, [47]) for HELLP syndrome and 12.8% according to a Ger￾manwide study [48]. Recurrence of AFL in subsequent pregnan￾cies has only been reported in individual cases [10]; however, the
risk of recurrence is significantly higher in cases with genetic de￾fects of fatty acid oxidation and can be up to 25% [3, 49].
503 Rath W et al. HELLP Syndrome or … Geburtsh Frauenheilk 2020; 80: 499–507

The risk of complications in later life for women with AFL has
not been sufficiently investigated to date [15]. Follow-up studies
up to an average of 54 months after the event (n = 25) found no
significant adverse maternal outcomes [50]. In contrast, women
with preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome are at increased risk of cardio￾vascular and metabolic diseases and neurological disorders in
later life [51, 52].
Discussion
Because of the similarities in terms of clinical findings and lab test
results, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are a
differential diagnostic challenge for obstetricians [7].
Based on an AFL incidence of 1 : 15 000 pregnancies, HELLP
syndrome is 72 times more common In Caucasian populations
than AFL [14].
Varying degrees of microvesicular steatosis are a common
morphological feature of both diseases [7].
There is no specific risk profile for both entities. With regard to
HELLP syndrome, it is worth bearing in mind that the average risk
of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy is 7% (4–19%) [47],
while the risk of recurrence of AFL is only increased if there are ge￾netic defects of fatty acid oxidation [49].
The prevalence of multiple pregnancies is significantly higher
in HELLP syndrome and AFL compared to uncomplicated singleton
pregnancies; for AFL the increased risk with multiple pregnancy is
ascribed to increased foetal production of fatty acid metabolites
which have a hepatotoxic effect [53]; with regard to HELLP syn￾drome, the increased risk is due to inadequate adaptation of the
maternal circulation in placental ischaemia and its complications.
Pregnant women whose foetuses have mitochondrial fatty ac￾id oxidation defects (e.g. LCHAD deficiency) have a significantly
higher risk of liver function disorders (overview in [15]). According
to studies by Jebbink et al. [19], heterozygous mothers of LCHAD￾deficient foetuses have a 77% risk of developing AFL or HELLP syn￾drome.
The carrier incidence for LCHAD deficiency in the USA is 1 : 675
[54].
A detailed overview of this topic is given in the review by Liu et
al. 2017 [15].
Differences between HELLP syndrome and AFL with regard to
clinical and laboratory findings as well as the course of disease
can be explained by the different pathogenesis of the two dis￾eases. Generalised endothelial dysfunction with vasoconstriction/

croangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with haemolysis and pro￾nounced thrombocytopenia as a consequence of microthrombo￾sis of liver arterioles leading to liver cell necrosis, and elevated
aminotransferase levels.
In contrast, dysfunction in AFL is initially limited to the liver and
is caused by pronounced microvesicular steatosis; as the liverʼs
metabolic capacity progressively decreases, this has a systemic ef￾fect (e.g. encephalopathy), potentially leading to multi-organ fail￾ure.
The problem is to detect either of the two diseases at an early
stage as, initially, patients with HELLP syndrome or AFL present
with unspecific symptoms such as general malaise, nausea, vomit￾ing and abdominal pain.
An appropriate action algorithm outlining the procedure which
should be followed in cases with suspicion of either of the disor￾ders is shown in ▶ Fig. 1.
Whether and to what extent the Swansea criteria are useful for
diagnosing AFL is still a matter of debate [15]. In their study of
24 pregnant women with AFL, Goel et al. [22] found that the
Swansea criteria had high positive and negative predictive values
(85 and 100%, respectively). Their findings were confirmed by
Knight et al. [10], who reported that the Swansea criteria had a
high diagnostic reliability (90%). After critically evaluating this
study, Minakami et al. [7] concluded that the Swansea criteria are
only suitable to diagnose AFL in critically ill pregnant women. Oth￾er problems associated with the Swansea criteria are their lack of
standardisation [15] and their use to differentiate AFL from HELLP
syndrome which should, in fact, be excluded prior to applying the
criteria [21] but occurs concomitantly with AFL in up to 20% of
cases [13, 14]. In one study, 8 out of 20 patients with AFL (subse￾quently confirmed by liver biopsy) who met the Swansea criteria
also met the criteria for HELLP syndrome [22]. A closer look at
the 14 Swansea criteria shows that up to 8 of these criteria (nau￾sea/vomiting, abdominal pain, ascites, elevated creatinine, ami￾notransferase, bilirubin and uric acid levels as well as microvesicu￾lar steatosis on liver biopsy) can also apply to HELLP syndrome.
Differences in clinical presentation between the two entities
include the absence of polydipsia/polyuria in HELLP syndrome.
Jaundice is more common and more pronounced in AFL while the
incidence of hypertension/proteinuria is lower. With increasing
liver failure, patients with AFL may also develop encephalopathy.
In contrast, the most prominent symptoms of HELLP syndrome
are neurological symptoms such as severe headache and/or visual
disturbances. Potential organ complications (e.g. acute renal fail￾ure, lung oedema) are similar for both diseases, although they oc￾cur more commonly with AFL than with HELLP syndrome (cf. ▶ Ta￾ble 2).
The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome is based on laboratory find￾ings, while the diagnosis of AFL is based on a combination of clini￾cal symptoms and laboratory findings. The differences with regard
to clinical and laboratory findings and the differentiation between
these entities and other liver diseases are shown in ▶ Table 3.
Laboratory findings are the most effective way of differentiat￾ing AFL from HELLP syndrome, with AFL characterised by leucocy￾tosis, hypoglycaemia, a less common incidence of proteinuria,
elevated direct bilirubin levels indicating intrahepatic cholestasis
(HELLP syndrome: elevation of indirect bilirubin levels as a conse￾quence of haemolysis), an initial absence of haemolysis, thrombo-

cytopenia < 100 G/l, decreased antithrombin by < 65% and pro￾longed prothrombin times [15, 27, 28, 35]. In addition, a patho￾logically elevated sFlT-1/PIGF ratio may facilitate the differentia￾tion between HELLP syndrome and AFL. Coagulopathy with pro￾longation of clotting times (prothrombin time, aPTT) due to re￾duced liver synthesis of clotting factors is more common with
AFL [7] but occurs less common with HELLP syndrome where it is
caused by DIC as a consequence of severe disease progression [5,
55].
While HELLP syndrome takes a fluctuating course with tran￾sient remissions or acute exacerbation of disease within a few
hours, AFL will progress to acute liver failure if the pregnancy is
not terminated [5, 35]. The postoperative course is similar for
both diseases, and normalisation of clinical and laboratory find￾ings usually occurs within 1–2 weeks.
Early termination of the pregnancy is the only causal therapy
for both entities [15, 27, 35]. Immediate delivery irrespective of
the week of gestation is mandatory for AFL. In contrast, conserva￾tive management is recommended for HELLP syndrome [6] be￾tween 24 + 0 and 33 + 6 weeks of gestation, as long as the mother
can be stabilised with antihypertensive and anticonvulsive medi￾cation and there are no signs of foetal compromise. The recom￾mendations of AWMF guideline 015/018 [6] on terminating preg￾nancy for fetal and/or maternal indications should be followed.
The latency period between making the diagnosis and delivery
has a significant impact on prognosis for AFL and acute HELLP syn￾drome [5, 12]. The advances in intensive care and the more rapid
time to establish diagnosis followed by immediate delivery has
significantly reduced maternal mortality rates for both entities in
the last 20–30 years [2, 15], with the maternal mortality rate for
AFL decreasing to 1.8–18% [10, 12] and the mortality rate for
HELLP syndrome dropping to around 1% in developed countries
[23].
Perinatal mortality rates for HELLP syndrome are 7–20% [23]
and 9–23% for AFL [3].
The long-term effects of AFL on the later life of mother and
child have not yet been sufficiently studied [15, 56]. It is known
that HELLP syndrome is associated with an increased risk of car￾diovascular disease/stroke for mother and child in later life [52].
Conclusion
HELLP syndrome and AFL are acute life-threatening complications
of pregnancy. Similarities in their clinical and laboratory findings
may lead to significant problems in differential diagnosis. Obste￾tricians must therefore be aware of the important differences be￾tween both diseases. Early diagnosis and immediate delivery have
a significant impact on prognosis for both AFL and acute HELLP
syndrome.
Important topics for future studies should include further in￾vestigations on predisposing factors (e.g. genetics, concomitant
diseases, environmental factors), the development of predictive
models to determine the course and progression of disease and,
for AFL, studies on the long-term impact of the disorder on moth￾er and child.
