Routine vaccination during covid-19 pandemic response
Falls in uptake must be reversed quickly
Sonia Saxena, 1 Helen Skirrow, 1 Helen Bedford2
Routine vaccination of pregnant women and children
must remain a priority during the covid-19 pandemic
response. The UK and other countries could
experience outbreaks of measles and other vaccine
preventable diseases if uptake of routine vaccinations
falls, undoing decades of progress. Vaccination has
been one of the most effective interventions in driving
down infant mortality to historically low levels
worldwide. Complete, timely vaccination protects
and confers benefits across the whole of childhood.
However, this protection is greatly reduced if vaccine
schedules are delayed or incomplete.1
In the UK, almost 95% of infants have completed their
primary vaccinations by their first birthday,2 but
uptake of later childhood vaccines and seasonal flu
and whooping cough vaccines recommended in
pregnancy, varies from year to year.3 4Uptake is lower
in inner cities, in deprived postcodes, and among
some minority ethnic groups.3Disease epidemics can
disrupt healthcare and cause resurgence of vaccine
preventable infections.5
In 2019, the UK lost its
measles “elimination status” because of outbreaks
resulting from historical low vaccine uptake.6
Children risk becoming unseen victims of the covid-19
pandemic.
Flawed messaging
Health professionals are concerned about the effect
on children’s health of the upheaval of NHS routine
care.7 The number of MMR (measles, mumps, and
rubella) vaccines delivered in England dropped by
20% during the first three weeks of the lockdown,8
and smaller falls were reported in infant vaccines in
Scotland.9 Although vaccination services are on the
priority list for primary care, this message has been
lost among the dominant message that everyone
should stay at home and avoid burdening the NHS
throughout April 2020.
Children’s visits to emergency departments fell by
over 90% during April 2020.10 Parents have expressed
concerns about overburdening the NHS and fear of
exposure to covid-19 when attending for vaccination.
Of 752 health visitors surveyed by the Institute of
Health Visiting in May 2020, over 60% reported
contact with families who had considered cancelling
or postponing their child’s vaccinations (Institute of
Health Visiting, personal communication).
The public is now being urged to “Stay alert, protect
the NHS, save lives,” which provides little assurance
for families that the NHS is open for routine care.
Messages are tailored to those with an excellent
command of English and may not reach families such
as recent migrants and those with poor health or
language literacy or little access to digital technology.
Over 75% of pregnant women admitted to hospital
in the UK with covid-19 were black or Asian,12 and
the risk of dying from covid-19 during hospital
admission is twofold to fourfold higher among black,
Asian, and minority ethnic groups than among white
people.1 2 Hence, pre-existing inequalities in uptake
may widen if parents from minority ethnic groups
feel more vulnerable and avoid healthcare settings.
Families concerned about vaccine safety will be
susceptible to strongly voiced opinion and
misinformation in the media.13 Many new parents
will also lack support and information usually
available from antenatal and postnatal support
groups.
Time for action
General practitioners, practice nurses, midwives, and
health visitors are well positioned to counsel
prospective and new parents about vaccination. In
areas of low uptake, contacting parents and pregnant
women directly may be valuable, as conversations
with a trusted healthcare professional can influence
vaccination decisions.14 Vaccine uptake in primary
care is highest when parents feel safe and are given
timely information that vaccines are due, and when
healthcare staff have systems to ensure robust call
and recall.15 Primary care has risen to the challenges
posed by covid-19 by enforcing triage to ensure safe
distancing and by introducing hygiene measures and
protective equipment to reduce infection risk. Some
general practices have adopted drive-in vaccine
clinics to reduce face-to-face contact with parents.16
Urgent action is required to maintain vaccination
rates and limit preventable infections. We need
clearer government messaging that reaches all groups
and more support in the community to inform and
reassure pregnant women and new parents about the
importance and safety of attending primary care for
vaccines during the pandemic. This needs to be
accompanied by investment to support primary care
teams to protect themselves and patients and to
access, store, and deliver vaccines during disruptions
to services and supplies. Primary care teams also
need to follow up missed vaccinations quickly by
strengthening reminder systems and providing
opportunistic vaccination. Finally, the government
must acknowledge that its policies have been blind
to the serious health disparities uncovered by
covid-19.17 It must invest in stronger public health
surveillance to monitor areas and populations in real
time to enable rapid local public health response to
any drop in vaccine uptake, particularly among
vulnerable groups.
The current pandemic is a reminder of the ever
present threat of infectious disease. We should not
miss this opportunity to strengthen public trust in
primary care and public health. We hope that a

covid-19 vaccine will enable us to end containment measures safely,
if such a vaccine can be developed. In the meantime, the health of
our children and the whole population depends on high uptake of
routine vaccinations.
