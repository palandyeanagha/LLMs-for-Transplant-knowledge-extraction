Abstract
Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has evolved considerably over the past two decades
and has been gradually utilized in severe trauma. However, the indications for the use of ECMO in trauma remain
uncertain and the clinical outcomes are different. We performed a systematic review to provide an overall estimate
of the current performance of ECMO in the treatment of trauma patients.
Materials and methods: We searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases up to the end of December 2019 for
studies on ECMO in trauma. The PRISMA statement was followed. Data on demographics of the patient,
mechanism of injury, injury severity scores (ISS), details of ECMO strategies, and clinical outcome were extracted.
Results: A total of 58 articles (19 retrospective reports and 39 case reports) were deemed eligible and included. In
total, 548 patients received ECMO treatment for severe trauma (adult 517; children 31; mean age of adults 34.9 ±
12.3 years). Blunt trauma (85.4%) was the primary injury mechanism, and 128 patients had traumatic brain injury
(TBI). The mean ISS was 38.1 ± 15.0. A total of 71.3% of patients were initially treated with VV ECMO, and 24.5%
were placed on VA ECMO. The median time on ECMO was 9.6 days, and the median time to ECMO was 5.7 days. A
total of 60% of patients received initially heparin anticoagulation. Bleeding (22.9%) and thrombosis (19%) were the
most common complications. Ischemia of the lower extremities occurred in 9 patients. The overall hospital
mortality was 30.3%.
Conclusions: ECMO has been gradually utilized in a lifesaving capacity in severe trauma patients, and the feasibility
and advantages of this technique are becoming widely accepted. The safety and effectiveness of ECMO in trauma
require further study. Several problems with ECMO in trauma, including the role of VA-ECMO, the time to institute
ECMO, and the anticoagulation strategy remain controversial and must be solved in future studies.

Background
Polytrauma is a leading cause of death among adults [1].
The major causes of early death are hemorrhagic shock,
hypoxemia, hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, coagulopa￾thy, and severe traumatic brain injury. Among these
causes, hypoxemia or acute respiratory distress syn￾drome (ARDS) still represents an important and fre￾quent contributing factor toward morbidity and
mortality after trauma [2, 3]. A recent systematic review
demonstrated no change in the mortality of trauma￾induced ARDS over the last several decades, and the
mortality ranges from 20.6 to 25.8% [4].
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a
simplified version of the heart-lung machine that can re￾store adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation, achieve
quick rewarming, and infuse massive fluids or blood
products. Over the past two decades, ECMO has evolved
considerably, especially in ECMO devices (i.e., ECMO
devices, centrifugal pump techniques, complete heparin￾coated circuits, more efficient oxygenators, or device

miniaturization). Since the first successful use of ECMO
in adults for acute posttraumatic respiratory failure re￾ported by Hill et al. in 1972 [5], ECMO has advanced
significantly and has become a salvage therapy that may
provide an alternative form of management for cardio￾pulmonary failure in traumatic patients when conven￾tional treatments have failed. However, some concerns
remain uncertain in trauma patients, such as the time to
ECMO and anticoagulation, and the current clinical out￾comes are different. Recently, survival rates for trauma
patients undergoing ECMO have been shown to range
from 44% to as high as 74.1% [6]. The aim of this sys￾tematic review is to provide an overall estimate of the
current performance of ECMO in the treatment of
trauma patients.
Methods
This systematic review was performed and reported in
line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [7].
We searched the PubMed and MEDLINE databases up
to the end of December 2019 using medical subject
headings and text words supplemented by scanning the
bibliographies of the recovered articles. We combined
“extracorporeal membrane oxygenation”, “ECMO”,
“extracorporeal life support”, “ECLS”, “extracorporeal
cardiopulmonary life support”, “trauma”, “multitrauma”,
“polytrauma”, and “injury” using the Boolean operator
“AND”. The results were limited to articles written in
English. Two separate researchers (C.W. and L.Z.) ana￾lyzed the data set to ensure accuracy and to identify all
available studies. The details of each publication were
checked to avoid duplicates. Any differences were re￾solved by consensus.
Inclusion criteria
All publications, including case reports and case series,
reported the application of ECMO during the treatment
of trauma patients. Only papers published in English
that reported age, sex, mechanism of injury, injury sever￾ity score (ISS), details of ECMO, and clinical outcome
were included.
Exclusion criteria
Studies or cases reporting on ECMO for treatment as a
bridge for delayed surgery, as support during an emer￾gency operation, on rewarming in the treatment of
hypothermia and on burns were not included in this re￾view. Similarly, correspondence, expert opinions, and re￾views were excluded. Cases that were not described in
the details of demographic data, especially the details of
ECMO and outcome, were also not included.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
The following basic parameters were extracted from
every publication: first author, date of publication and
study, study design (e.g., retrospective study vs. case re￾port), number of patients included, patient demograph￾ics, mechanism of injury, type of trauma, ISS, Glasgow
coma scale (GCS), details of ECMO (time to ECMO,
duration of ECMO, type of ECMO, access route of
ECMO), anticoagulation management, mortality, cause
of death and ECMO-related complications.
The risk of bias was assessed at the study level using
Cochrane’s Collaboration Tool [8]. Through six do￾mains, this tool evaluates the risk of bias and categorizes
each study as high risk, low risk, or unclear risk.
Statistical analysis
Data collected were organized on an Apple Numbers
(version 6.6.2) spreadsheet. Descriptive statistics were
used to describe demographic and continuous data (e.g.,
mean ± SD). Dichotomous variables are expressed as
numbers with percentages.
Results
The literature search yielded 7624 publications in the
PubMed and MEDLINE databases. We screened them
by title/abstract and full text. Finally, 58 publications (19
retrospective reports and 39 case reports) that focused
on ECMO in trauma were identified from the literature
and included in the analysis, spanning a period of time
ranging from 1972 to 2019 (Fig. 1). All studies were
retrospective studies or case series, with no prospective
controlled studies.
Demographic data
A total of 548 trauma patients requiring ECMO were
described, including 517 adults (94.3%) and 31 children
(5.7%). There was a wide difference in sample size ran￾ging from 1 patient to 85 patients. The retrospective re￾ports had 497 patients, and case reports included 51
patients. The majority of patients were male (n = 441,
80.1%), and 99 were female (18.1%). One report did not
provide the patient’s gender. In adults, the mean age was
34.9 ± 12.3 years (range 18–86 years), and the youngest
patient in the group of children was only 21 months old.
Four reports did not provide data on the cause of in￾jury (n = 175). In the remaining 373 cases, traffic acci￾dents (n = 254, 68.1%) were the most common cause of
injury, followed by falling (n = 38, 10.2%). Gunshots (n =
13, 3.5%) and stabbing (n = 6, 1.6%) were the major
causes of penetrating trauma. The data on the mechan￾ism of trauma were available in 53 papers (n = 384).
Blunt trauma (n = 328, 85.4%) was the primary injury
mechanism with very high injury severity and a signifi￾cant thoracic component. In this review, 259 (n = 67.4%)
Wang et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:51 Page 2 of 14

patients had chest trauma. Penetration occurred in six￾teen patients (4.2%). A total of 128 patients had trau￾matic brain injury (TBI) in 52 publications, including
404 trauma patients. Twenty-four papers provided the
Injury Severity Score (ISS). The mean ISS was 38.1 ±
15.0 (range 4–75). The mean Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) was 7.3 ± 4.7 (range 3–15) in 19 papers.
The overall hospital mortality was 30.3% (n = 166).
There was a wide variation in mortality rates among
the studies (0–71.4%). In the 19 retrospective reports,
the overall mortality was 33% (n = 164), and in case
reports, it was 3.9% (n = 2). Six deaths occurred in
the pediatric group (19.4%). The leading cause of
death was MOF (n = 34). The following causes were
sepsis (n = 23), cardiorespiratory failure (n = 22),
cerebrovascular accident (n = 18), death after with￾drawal of care (n = 11), massive hemorrhage (n =
10), ECLS failure (n = 4), and mesenteric ischemia (n
= 1). The cause of death was unknown or missing
among 68 patients (Table 1).
ECMO strategies
A total of 391 patients (71.3%) were initially treated with
VV ECMO, and 134 patients (24.5%) were initially
placed on VA ECMO. Twelve of those treated with VV
ECMO converted to VA ECMO support due to
persistent hemodynamic instability. Only two cases on
VA ECMO were converted to VV ECMO.
A total of 377 patients (68.8%) were cannulated per￾ipherally, three patients were centrally cannulated (fem￾oral vein-aortic root; right atrium-aorta; right atrium￾pulmonary artery), and 168 patients (30.7%) did not de￾scribe the type of cannulation. Single dual-lumen cathe￾ters were used in this group, but the details could not be
identified from the literature.
The median time on ECMO was 9.6 days in this group,
and the longest was 114 days. The duration before
ECMO support was recorded differently, including from
injury to ECMO, from ER to ECMO, from the onset of
ARDS to ECMO, and from the ventilator to ECMO. The
median time before ECMO support was 5.7 days. In 28
cases, this time was recorded approximately (<1 day)
(Table 2).
Anticoagulation
The anticoagulation strategy on ECMO in trauma pa￾tients differed among institutions. Seven papers included
164 cases (30%) that did not provide details of anticoa￾gulation. A total of 329 patients (60%) received anticoa￾gulation while on ECMO, and 55 patients did not
receive anticoagulation. In the anticoagulation group,
135 (24.6%) patients received heparin systemic

anticoagulation. Heparin titration (heparin-minimized
strategy) was applied to 80 (14.6%) patients. A total of
101 (18.4%) patients were initially managed with heparin
(did not provide the later strategy), while 13 (2.4%) pa￾tients were initially managed with heparin (1–3 days);
then, heparin was stopped due to bleeding or other
causes. In the anticoagulation-free group, 16 (2.9%) pa￾tients did not receive any anticoagulation while on
ECMO. Initial heparin-free therapy occurred in 14
(2.6%) patients, and 24 (4.4%) patients received initial
heparin-free therapy (2.5 h—5 days) followed by heparin
systemic anticoagulation. Nafamostat mesilate was re￾ported on ECMO in two studies, but the details could
not be extracted.
Activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) were the two most com￾mon coagulation parameters, which were used in 124
cases and 120 cases, respectively. ACT between 180 and
220 s was the most targeted time. The target aPTT was
between 40 and 80 s. In one study, the target was a
TEG-reactive (R) time of two times the nonheparinized
baseline.
Complications
A total of 104 patients (22.9%) had documented bleeding
complications at 120 sites, including surgical site bleed￾ing (n = 26), cannula site bleeding (n = 20), diffuse
bleeding or DIC (n = 12), intracranial bleeding (n = 7),
intrathoracic bleeding (n = 5), intra-abdominal bleeding
(n = 3), gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5), pulmonary
bleeding (n = 3), bleeding from tracheostomies (n = 2),
and bleeding from the mouth or nose (n = 2). Thirty￾five sites were missing (Fig. 2). Four papers, which in￾cluded 94 patients, did not report bleeding complica￾tions. The surgical site was the most common bleeding
site, followed by the cannula site. The incidence of
bleeding complications was different in series reports,
ranging from 0 to 87.5%, and the majority of these
events did not require surgical intervention.

Thrombotic complications are listed in Fig. 3, includ￾ing femoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT), oxygenator
and circuit clotting, brain infarction, pulmonary embol￾ism, inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus, right internal
jugular vein (RIJ) thrombus, right upper extremity (RUE)
thrombus, and superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus. Nine
papers (296 cases) did not document complications.
Forty-eight of 252 patients (19%) experienced throm￾botic complications. A total of 39.6% of patients had
femoral DVT. The incidence of thrombi in oxygenators
and circuits was 27.1%.
The other ECMO-related complications occurred in
25 cases reported in 15 publications, including ischemia
of the lower extremity, abdominal compartment syn￾drome, brain swelling, acute lung edema, acute pancrea￾titis, accidental removal of a cannula, pseudoaneurysm
developed on the site of the cannula, and secondary
sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP)
(Table 3). Ischemia of the lower extremities (n = 9) was
the most common cannula-related complication, and 3
patients underwent fasciotomy. The other complications
were very rare.
Discussion
Generally, the lung is the first organ to fail after severe
trauma (failure after 3.7 ± 2.8 days) [65]. In our review,
ECMO has been used successfully in a series of trauma
patients, but the evidence of benefit is still limited. From
our investigation, the reported mortality in publications
ranged from 11.1 to 71.4%, with the exception of case
reports. The mean hospital mortality was 30.3%, while in
the pediatric group, it was 19.4%. Mortality remains
high, and the cause should take into account the overall
injury as well as those that are ECMO-related, because
most of the population in this study was young and had
a median age of 34.9 years, with good cardiopulmonary
function at baseline. In a multicenter study by Kruit
et al. [9], fifty-two patients who experienced trauma and
were supported with ECMO were identified from the
five ECMO centers. The overall hospital mortality was
11.5%, and the overall 180-day mortality was 15%. These

preliminary results suggest that ECMO may provide sur￾vival benefits and seems to be safe in selected trauma
populations. However, owing to the difference of injury,
indications and time of ECMO, and follow-up data, the
benefits of ECMO in trauma should be confirmed
through further studies, for example, randomized con￾trol trials.
When to initiate ECMO is a challenge to clinicians.
In this study, the time to initiate ECMO in the
trauma patients was different, ranging from 0 to 24
days, and the mean time was 5.7 days. Kruit et al.
demonstrated that there was no significant difference
between survivors and nonsurvivors in time from in￾jury to ECMO commencement [9]. Ahmad et al. [16]
also did not find an association between the time to
initiation of ECMO and mortality. Summary data sug￾gest that delaying the institution of ECMO may cause
irreversible pulmonary and cardiac injuries in addition
to other organs and lead to poor outcomes [66].
Bosarge et al. evaluated a series of 15 patients with
severe ARDS who underwent early ECMO (mean 1.9
days) and found that the patients in the early ECMO
group had improved survival (64%) compared with
historical controls (13%), suggesting that ECMO
should be considered at the early onset of severe
ARDS to improve survival [18]. Early ECMO initi￾ation may offer advantages such as reducing ventilator
time to prevent iatrogenic lung damage from high￾pressure and high FiO2 ventilation, supplying ad￾equate oxygenation and/or tissue perfusion, and pro￾viding lung and heart rest. However, ECMO initiation
may increase the bleeding risk in the early stages of
trauma due to heparin systemic anticoagulation, espe￾cially in patients with intracranial or active systemic
bleeding.
VV ECMO with peripheral cannulation (PC) is the
most common model of ECMO in trauma. In this re￾view, 71.4% of patients received VV ECMO support, and
24.5% received VA ECMO. The study based on the
ELSO registry [19] showed a trend toward the use of
venovenous ECMO compared with venoarterial ECMO,
as 79.4% of survivors were treated with venovenous
ECMO compared with 59.1% of nonsurvivors. One re￾cent systematic review combining 215 trauma patients
supported with ECMO reported a survival-to-discharge
rate ranging from 56 to 89% after VV ECMO and 42 to
63% after VA ECMO [3]. In the study reported by Lang
et al. [11], VA ECMO was applied in 15 cases, and 11
patients (73%) died. However, limited studies have ex￾amined outcomes for VA ECMO in trauma patients. VA
ECMO is indicated for cardiopulmonary support rather
than for pulmonary support alone, which enables the re￾stricted and congested heart to recover by unloading the
heart. Severe chest trauma in many cases can cause
acute lethal cardiac failure primarily by contusion of the
heart or secondary by pulmonary contusion. These pa￾tients might benefit from ECMO. A recent study [13]
using ECMO to treat patients with advanced shock or
respiratory failure showed different mortality rates be￾tween VA and VV ECMO: 64.3% in VA ECMO and
27.3% in VV ECMO. It is likely that patients requiring
VA ECMO had poorer survival rates because they re￾quired hemodynamic support and not simply because
VA ECMO was used. Therefore, much work still needs
to be done to determine the effects and safety of VA
ECMO in severe trauma patients.
Therapeutic heparin potentially increases the risk of
bleeding, especially in polytrauma with TBI and/or intra￾cranial bleeding. In this review, there are different antic￾oagulation strategies in the literature, including full
heparin systemic anticoagulation, a heparin-minimized
strategy, and all heparin-free, initially heparin-free and
delayed heparin-free treatments, and there was a wide
range (1.9–87.5%) of reported bleeding complications.
According to the Extracorporeal Life Support
Organization Registry Report 2012 [67], the main com￾plication during VV-ECMO is bleeding, which occurs in
17 to 21.3% of cases. In the report by Ahmad et al [16],
the use of anticoagulation was significantly associated
with survival: 94% of survivors were anticoagulated ver￾sus only 55% of nonsurvivors. However, several reports
have shown that patients can be successfully managed
on heparin-free ECMO without increasing the extent of
the bleeding [17, 22, 28, 29, 35, 38]. These may benefit
from the technological advancements in ECMO, includ￾ing the use of more efficient membrane oxygenators,
centrifugal pumps, miniaturization of circuits, and
heparin-bonded circuitry, which have allowed ECMO
use with little or no anticoagulation. Anticoagulation
should be individually tailored, taking into account the
severity of the trauma, the timing, and active bleeding.
In this literature review, 128 patients suffering from
traumatic brain injury (TBI) were included. Unfortu￾nately, the details of anticoagulation and mortality
could not be identified. Biderman et al. [22] reported
a series of 10 patients, including 7 with TBI and six
patients who survived. The median GCS score on ar￾rival was 7 (range 5–9) and improved in all survivors
to 14 (range 12–15). All but two patients regained
normal neurologic status during follow-up. Of the 10
patients, only 3 could receive heparin during the first
48 h. In those patients who could not receive heparin,
high blood flow (4–5 L/min) was maintained to pre￾vent clotting. In a multicenter study [9], 52 traumatic
patients were included, and 19 had TBI. Twelve pa￾tients with TBI (63%) were anticoagulated, and 3 with
TBI died (16%). In another series report [17] includ￾ing 7 consecutive severe trauma patients and 4 with

TBI, VV-ECLS was not withheld from patients with
TBI despite evidence of intracranial bleeding. Four
patients were successfully discharged, and three of
these survivors had concomitant TBI without neuro￾logic sequelae. TBI is not contraindicated for ECMO,
and routine management, including mild hypothermia
(34 °C), can be tolerated under heparin-free VV
ECMO [17, 68]. The current findings do not support
neurological injury as an absolute contraindication to
ECMO.
Limitations
This systematic review presents limitations. All of the in￾cluded publications on ECMO technology in trauma still
consist of either retrospective studies or case series with
limited data or case reports, and thus, the present report
possesses all the inherent limitations, including the weak
of the evidence, geographical bias, publication bias,
search bias, methodology bias. Another limitation is the
number and quality of the studies available for qualita￾tive analysis. Some studies had incomplete data. Finally,
follow-up data and long-term survival data are not yet
available from this analysis. Therefore, a general conclu￾sion from a solid statistical analysis with adequate sam￾ples is lacking.
Conclusions
Our systematic review illustrates that ECMO has been
gradually utilized in a lifesaving capacity in patients
with severe trauma, and the feasibility and advantages
of this technique are becoming widely accepted. How￾ever, the safety and effectiveness of ECMO in trauma
require further study. Several problems with ECMO
in trauma, including the role of VA-ECMO, the time
to institute ECMO, and the anticoagulation strategy
remain controversial and must be solved in the future
studies. Indeed, clinical randomized control trials with
large samples and long-term survival data are needed.
