In the last decade several therapeutic antibodies have been Federal Drug Administration
(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved. Although their mechanisms of
action in vivo is not fully elucidated, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) medi￾ated by natural killer (NK) cells is presumed to be a key effector function. A substantial
role of ADCC has been demonstrated in vitro and in mouse tumor models. However, a
direct in vivo effect of ADCC in tumor reactivity in humans remains to be shown. Several
studies revealed a predictive value of FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism in monoclonal anti￾body treatment, indicating a potential effect of ADCC on outcome for certain indications.
Furthermore, the use of therapeutic antibodies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation is an interesting option. Studying the role of the FcγRIIIa-V158F polymor￾phism and the influence of Killer-cell Immunoglobuline-like Receptor (KIR) receptor ligand
incompatibility on ADCC in this approach may contribute to future transplantation strate￾gies. Despite the success of approved second-generation antibodies in the treatment of
several malignancies, efforts are made to further augment ADCC in vivo by antibody engi￾neering. Here, we review currently used therapeutic antibodies for which ADCC has been
suggested as effector function.

INTRODUCTION
Naturally cytotoxic cells against tumor cells were first described in
humans and mice in the 1970s of the last century (Rosenberg et al.,
1972; Oldham and Herberman, 1973; Herberman et al., 1975a,b;
Kiessling et al., 1975a,b). Initially regarded as artifacts, these cells
were recognized eventually as a novel lymphocyte population and
named natural killer (NK) cells after their natural occurrence and
spontaneous capacity to kill lymphomas and leukemic cells in non￾immunized animals (Kiessling et al., 1975a,b). Nowadays, NK cells
are recognized as a subset of cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)
which are able to directly kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells
and participate in shaping the adaptive immunity by secretion of
cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ) (Vivier et al., 2011). The role of NK cells
in human cancer is highlighted by a study linking low peripheral
blood NK cell activity with increased cancer risk (Imai et al., 2000).
Furthermore, an association of NK cell infiltration into the tumor
site with better disease prognosis has been shown for several malig￾nancies (Carrega et al., 2008; Halama et al., 2011; Platonova et al.,
2011; Eckl et al., 2012).
Human NK cells are defined by the phenotype CD3− CD56+;
additionally they are CD19 and CD14 negative. The only marker
that is specific for NK cells is NKp46. NK cells comprise 5–15%
of all circulating lymphocytes (Lanier et al., 1986; Walzer et al.,
2007). They are commonly divided into two major subpopula￾tions, CD56dim CD16+ and CD56bright CD16−, with each of those
possessing distinct effector functions. The CD56dim CD16+ subset
comprises 90% of all peripheral blood NK cells and mediates an
early response via direct cellular cytotoxicity induced by perforin
and granzyme, FasL, and TRAIL interactions as well as cytokine
production (De Maria et al., 2011). One major characteristic of
NK cells is their constant state of readiness to respond immedi￾ately. In contrast to T cells, NK cells constitutively express perforin.
This facilitates the instant polarized delivery of apoptosis-inducing
granzymes after formation of a lytic synapse between the NK cell
and a target cell (Shresta et al., 1995). The CD56bright CD16−
subset mediates a late but sustained effector function via potent
pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release of mainly IFN￾γ, but is poorly cytotoxic (De Maria et al., 2011). NK cell activation
and cytotoxicity is controlled by a complex balance between acti￾vating receptors, inhibitory receptors and co-receptors (Lanier,
2003; Leung, 2011). Positive and negative downstream signals of
these receptors are integrated and decisive for NK cell activa￾tion (Figure 1). Hence, absence of inhibitory signals on target
cells together with engagement of activating receptors as NKG2D,
DNAM-1, and 2B4 as well as the natural cytotoxicity receptors
(NCRs), including NKp46, NKp44, and NKp30 mediate triggering
of resting NK cells (Moretta et al., 2001; Bryceson and Long, 2008;
Lanier, 2008). Whereas for NKG2D, DNAM-1, and 2B4 multiple
ligands are known (Bottino et al., 2005), despite their involvement
in tumor cell lysis the NCR ligands have remained rather elusive
(Moretta et al., 2006). Nevertheless, NKp30 has been shown to
recognize a tumor cell ligand of the B7 family, B7-H6 (Brandt
et al., 2009) and NKp44 is suggested to recognize proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), which surprisingly triggers inhibition of

antibody treatment. (A) Without antibody therapy, NK cells are tolerant to
healthy cells and tumor cells, if the strength of activating signal they receive
upon encountering activating ligands on these malignant cells does not
overcome the inhibitory signaling delivered by inhibitory ligands as, e.g., MHC
class I molecules. (B) Upon treatment with tumor antigen-associated (TAA)

NK cells (Rosental et al., 2011). However, several of those receptors
need to be triggered by target cells for activating downstream sig￾nals to prevail over inhibitory signals and NK cells to be activated
and to mediate target cell lysis (Moretta et al., 2001; Bryceson et al.,
2006).
ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY
Most hematopoietic cells, except most T cell subsets, express Fcγ
receptors (FcγRs) (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008). There are
three types of FcγRs which recognize the Fc part of IgG antibody
subclasses with different affinities. The activating FcγRI (CD64)
binds to human IgG1 and IgG3 with high affinity, is expressed
on macrophages and neutrophils, and mediates phagocytosis of
target cells. The FcγRII (CD32) class comprises activating low
affinity FcγRIIa (which binds human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3) and
inhibitory FcγRIIb (which recognizes human IgG1 and IgG3 with
low affinity) and may attenuate signaling from activating receptors
as FcγRI if engaged in phagocytes. FcγRIIIb is a protein expressed
by neutrophils and may play a role in neutrophil activation. Acti￾vating low affinity FcγRIIIa (type III receptor for IgG; CD16)
mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
is highly expressed on the cytotoxic CD56dim CD16+ NK cell
subset as well as on other hematopoietic cells. Nevertheless, NK
cells are thought to be the key mediators of ADCC, since only
NK cells do not co-express the inhibitory FcγRIIb. In contrast,
all other FcγR-expressing cells are tightly controlled by the bal￾ance between activating and inhibitory FcγRs. Efficient FcγRIIIa
signaling depends on high avidity for specific binding to anti￾bodies which ensures that NK cells are activated when antibodies
have bound to a multimeric or multivalent cognate antigen only
(Banks et al., 2002). These antibodies of the subclasses IgG1 and
IgG3 binding to FcγRIIIa induce a potent activating signal which
overcomes inhibitory signals and results in both cytotoxicity and a
cytokine response (Chan et al., 2012) (Figure 1). Co-engagement
of other activating receptors has a synergistic effect and may
enhance NK cell activation (Bryceson et al., 2006).
Several mouse model studies postulated the impact of activat￾ing FcγRs on anti-tumor effects in antibody therapy indicating
that ADCC has a substantial effect on tumor rejection. A study
using a xenograft breast carcinoma model has shown that an
antibody engineered to prevent Fc binding to FcγRIIIa and spe￾cific to Her2/neu [Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) 2, CD340] which is overexpressed in certain aggressive
types of breast cancer, was, in contrary to its murine parental anti￾body targeting Her2/neu, unable to arrest tumor growth in vivo
(Clynes et al., 2000). Additionally, this study in mice showed in a
murine lymphoma model that treatment with CD20-specific anti￾body rituximab was capable of preventing tumor growth in FcR
wild-type mice whereas FcR knock-out mice failed to mediate
antibody-dependent tumor protection. Another study demon￾strated ADCC in mice in vivo by showing formation of ADCC
synapses in immunocompetent mice bearing a murine breast
tumor treated with an antibody specific to Tn, a glycopeptidic
antigen which is expressed by breast cancer and a variety of
other epithelial tumors in mice and humans (Hubert et al., 2011).
Additionally, tumor rejection was abolished in mice deficient for
FcγRs – emphasizing the potential role of ADCC (Hubert et al.,
2011).

Seidel et al. ADCC in tumor immunotherapy
Another study investigated the relative contributions of
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and ADCC in a
murine GD2-expressing metastatic lymphoma model treated with
an antibody specific to the disialoganglioside GD2 utilizing wild￾type, complement-deficient, complement-receptor-deficient, and
FcγRI/III-deficient mice. Outcome after treatment with the ADCC
and CDC mediating GD2 antibody was unaffected in mice inca￾pable for CDC but was almost completely abrogated in FcγRI/III￾deficient mice that were disqualified for ADCC (Imai et al., 2005).
These results further highlight the key role of ADCC in anti-tumor
effects in mice in vivo. In men it has been shown, that breast can￾cer patients who responded with partial or complete remission to
Her2/neu-specific antibody trastuzumab have a higher capacity to
mediate ADCC in vitro than patients which failed to respond to
antibody therapy (Musolino et al., 2008).
These studies indicate that, at least in murine models, ADCC
is a considerable component of the in vivo activity of therapeu￾tic antibodies against tumors. However, studies with therapeutic
antibodies in humans which demonstrate the direct influence of
ADCC, as, e.g., ADCC as the single effector mechanism, remain
to be conducted. Therefore, the direct in vivo effect of ADCC in
tumor reactivity in humans remains to be shown.
INFLUENCE OF FcγRIIIa POLYMORPHISM AND KILLER-CELL
IMMUNOGLOBULINE-LIKE RECEPTOR (KIR) RECEPTOR
LIGAND INCOMPATIBILITY ON ADCC IN PATIENTS
In the past 15 years, 12 therapeutic antibodies have reached FDA
approval for hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors
(Scott et al., 2012). Their mechanisms of action include direct
anti-tumor effects as induction of apoptosis, blocking receptor
signaling or acting as an agonist, delivery of a cytotoxic agent,
immune-mediated effects as CDC and ADCC as well as effects
on the tumor microenvironment. At least five of these antibod￾ies mediate efficient ADCC and a large number of new con￾structs are currently under investigation in early and late phase
clinical trials (Table 1). In this review we will use anti-CD20-
specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab, CD52-specific
mAb alemtuzumab, Her2/neu-specific mAb trastuzumab, EGFR￾specific mAb cetuximab, and anti-GD2 antibodies to discuss the
influence of ADCC in treatment with therapeutic antibodies.
The CD16 encoding gene FCGR3A bears a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 526 [thymidine
(T)→guanine (G)] resulting in an amino acid (aa) exchange at
aa position 158 of phenylalanine (F) to valine (V). It has been
demonstrated that human IgG1 binds more efficiently to NK cells
expressing the FcγRIIIa-158V allotype than to the FcγRIIIa-158F
allotype (Koene et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1997). In vitro studies have
shown that the increased binding is caused by a significantly higher
affinity of IgG antibodies to FcγRIIIa-158V receptors, whereas
expression levels of FcγRIIIa on NK cells are not influenced by
the FcγRIIIa polymorphism (Dall’Ozzo et al., 2004; Congy-Jolivet
et al., 2008). Furthermore, the adequate rituximab concentration
exciting 50% lysis of a CD20+ tumor cell line has been shown
to be significantly lower in FcγRIIIa-158V/V donors compared to
FcγRIIIa-158F/F donors (Dall’Ozzo et al., 2004).
Several clinical studies investigating antibodies which utilize
an ADCC-mediating therapeutic antibody suggest that patients
with the FcγRIIIa-158V allotype have a better clinical outcome.
However, conflicting data have been published. First, we will dis￾cuss the chimeric IgG1 CD20-specific antibody rituximab which
is approved for treatment of CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lym￾phoma (NHL), CD20+ follicular NHL, and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). Rituximab is the most extensively studied anti￾body mediating ADCC as its key effector mechanism (Cheson
and Leonard, 2008; Alduaij and Illidge, 2011). The first study by
Cartron et al. (2002) suggested that the homozygous FcγRIIIa￾158V/V genotype is beneficial in patients with follicular NHL
regarding clinical and molecular responses to single agent ritux￾imab. These results were confirmed in a larger follicular lymphoma
patient cohort treated with rituximab as monotherapy and an
association of the FcγRIIIa-158V/V genotype with progression￾free survival could be shown (Weng and Levy, 2003). Another
study analyzing the effect of the FcγRIIIa genotype on the outcome
of patients to single agent rituximab promoted some of the above
mentioned reports by suggesting a significant improvement in
event-free survival in FcγRIIIa-158V/V patients (Ghielmini et al.,
2005). Furthermore, it has been postulated that NK cells from
lymphoma patients with the FcγRIIIa-158V allotype but not from
patients that are homozygous for FcγRIIIa-158F/F were activated
after rituximab application (Veeramani et al., 2011).
On the contrary, no influence of the FcγRIIIa-F158V polymor￾phism on the outcome of follicular lymphoma patients treated
with risk-adapted chemotherapy and rituximab has been shown
(Prochazka et al., 2011). Similarly, in relapsed or refractory CLL

patients treated with chemotherapy and rituximab, no significant
influence of the FcγRIIIa-F158V polymorphism was demon￾strated (Dornan et al., 2010). Another study evaluated the impact
of the FcγRIIIa-F158V polymorphism on the response to rit￾uximab in combination with a chemotherapy regimen (ritux￾imab with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin,
and predniso(lo)ne, R-CHOP) in diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) patients. The FcγRIIIa-158V allotype was shown to be
significantly correlated with a higher complete response rate com￾pared with the FcγRIIIa-158F allotype (Kim et al., 2006). However,
overall survival did not correlate with the FcγRIIIa-158V/V geno￾type and several other studies investigating the impact of the
FcγRIIIa-F158V polymorphism in DLBCL found no association
with the response to R-CHOP (Carlotti et al., 2007; Mitrovic et al.,
2007;Varoczy et al., 2012). Interestingly, all studies conducted with
rituximab as monotherapy show an impact of the FcγRIIIa-F158V
polymorphism and therefore indicate an important influence of
ADCC on clinical outcome. However, the picture is less clear
when rituximab is combined with chemotherapy. Since combined
chemotherapy may hamper ADCC due to impaired NK cell func￾tion the combination of rituximab with chemotherapy might mask
the influence of the FcγRIIIa genotype and ADCC. Nevertheless, a
combination of rituximab with chemotherapy generally improves
clinical results.
The humanized IgG1 mAb alemtuzumab was approved for
treatment of B-CLL and is directed against the glycoprotein CD52
(Hillmen et al., 2007). The therapeutic antibody was withdrawn
from the market in 2012 in order to optimize the pending launch
of the agent as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. The predomi￾nant mechanism of action of alemtuzumab in vivo has not been
clearly defined but involvement of ADCC mediated by NK cells
and neutrophils has been suggested by studies employing a human
CD52 transgenic mouse model and a xenograft model (Hu et al.,
2009; Siders et al., 2010). In addition, CDC and direct induction
of apoptosis have been identified as other potential mechanisms
of action in in vitro studies (Table 1) (Crowe et al., 1992; Mone
et al., 2006). A study exploiting the predictive value of FcγRIIIa
polymorphism in a small CLL patient cohort (n = 33) treated with
alemtuzumab found no association of responsiveness to the mAb
with a FcγRIIIa-F158V allotype (Lin et al., 2005). However,further
studies with larger patient cohorts are required in order to deter￾mine the potential influence of FcγRIIIa-F158V polymorphism
and ADCC in treatment with alemtuzumab.
The humanized IgG1 mAb trastuzumab is applicable in
HER2/neu-positive breast cancer patients and mediates abroga￾tion of tumor cell signaling and ADCC (Table 1) (Hudis, 2007). A
study investigating breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab
and a chemotherapeutic agent postulated a higher response rate
and longer progression-free survival in homozygous FcγRIIIa￾158V/V patients compared to patients with the FcγRIIIa-158F
allotype (Musolino et al., 2008). In contrast, another study sug￾gested a correlation of the FcγRIIa-131H/H genotype with objec￾tive response and progression-free survival in HER2/neu-positive
non-metastatic and metastatic breast cancer patients treated with
chemotherapy and trastuzumab but no significant correlation
was observed for the FcγRIIIa-F158V/V genotype (Tamura et al.,
2011). Furthermore, another recent study postulated a lack of
correlation between FcγRIIIa genotypes and trastuzumab efficacy
in HER2/neu-positive non-metastatic breast cancer patients
treated with a combined trastuzumab-chemotherapy (Hurvitz
et al., 2012). Since no studies with trastuzumab as single agent
have been published and besides ADCC abrogation of tumor
cell signaling being a major effector mechanism of trastuzumab
the influence of FcγRIIIa-F158V polymorphism and ADCC on
clinical outcome is hard to substantiate.
The chimeric IgG1 therapeutic antibody cetuximab targets
EGFR in colorectal cancer (CRC) and has like trastuzumab ADCC
and abrogation of tumor cell signaling as the modes of action
(Table 1) (Van Cutsem et al., 2009). A study suggested a signifi￾cantly higher clinical benefit after treatment with cetuximab and
chemotherapy in homozygous FcγRIIIa-158V/V and or FcγRIIa￾131H/H patients. These results were independent from the GTPase
KRas (KRAS) mutation status in metastatic CRC (mCRC) (Bibeau
et al., 2009). Furthermore, a higher disease control rate in KRAS￾mutated mCRC patients harboring the FcγRIIa-131H/H genotype
and treated with combined cetuximab-chemotherapy has been
shown (Rodriguez et al., 2012). It has been suggested that the pre￾dictive value of FcγRIIa-H131R polymorphism may result from
linkage disequilibrium between FcγRIIIa-V158F and FcγRIIa￾H131R and therefore nevertheless indicates an effect of ADCC
(Lejeune et al., 2008). Similarly, the association of the FcγRIIIa￾F158V polymorphism with progression-free survival has been sug￾gested for single agent cetuximab treated mCRC patients (Zhang
et al., 2007). However, in this study and in another study from
Dahan et al. investigating combined cetuximab-chemotherapy
treatment, the FcγRIIIa-158F allele rather than the FcγRIIIa-158V
allele had a favorable influence on overall and progression-free sur￾vival (Zhang et al., 2007; Dahan et al., 2011). Beyond that, a recent
study found no association of clinical outcome in a patient cohort
of 107 mCRC patients treated with cetuximab and chemother￾apy and FcγRIIIa-F158V and FcγRIIa-H131R polymorphisms
(Park et al., 2012). These discrepancies related to the predictive
value of the FcγRIIIa-F158V polymorphism on cetuximab treat￾ment are difficult to explain and indicate a demand for further
elaborated investigations in larger patient cohorts. Interestingly,
mutated KRAS induces a ligand-independent activation of EGFR
downstream signaling pathways. Hence, the key effector mecha￾nism of cetuximab besides ADCC, namely abrogation of tumor
signaling, is invalidated by KRAS mutations. Clinical benefit of
cetuximab yet seen in these patients and the predictive value of
FcγRIIIa-V158F genotype emphasizes the impact of ADCC.
Disialoganglioside GD2 is a sialic acid containing glycosphin￾golipid which is uniformly expressed in neuroblastoma and most
melanomas but also to a variable degree in some other tumors
(Navid et al., 2010). Due to its tumor-associated expression, several
anti-GD2 antibodies such as the chimeric IgG1 antibody ch14.18
and its humanized counterpart hu14.18 as well as 3F8 have been
developed and deployed in the clinic. The mechanisms of actions
of these antibodies are ADCC and CDC. Several years ago, a phase
I study with pediatric neuroblastoma patients treated with anti￾GD2 antibody ch14.18 was conducted at our institute and elicited
some complete and partial tumor responses in neuroblastoma
patients (Handgretinger et al., 1995). Currently, we are conducting
an ongoing phase I/II-trial for relapsed metastatic neuroblastoma
Frontiers in Immunology | Alloimmunity and Transplantation March 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 76 | 4

Seidel et al. ADCC in tumor immunotherapy
with subsequent immunotherapy with ch14.18/Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) after HLA mismatched, haploidentical stem cell
transplantation (SCT) at our institution. Preliminary results show
effective ADCC and complement-mediated anti-tumor effects
against neuroblastoma cells with donor-derived NK cells in vitro
as well as significant anti-tumor effectsin vivo (unpublished data).
Due to yet small patient cohorts, the role of FcγRIIIa-F158V poly￾morphism in treatment with GD2 antibodies has not been studied
up to now. However, there are a variety of further studies ongoing
which investigate the in vivo efficacy of GD2 antibodies (Navid
et al., 2010; Shusterman et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010; Alderson and
Sondel, 2011; Simon et al., 2011). Yu et al. demonstrated in a ran￾domized trial a significantly better event-free survival for patients
who received a combination of ch14.18, GM-CSF, and interleukin
2 than patients without ch14.18. Additionally, the third-generation
antibody hu14.18K322A, which bears an aa substitution in the
CH2 part, has been suggested to induce increased dose-dependent
ADCC compared to ch14.18 and hu14.18, whereas dose-limiting
CDC is intercepted by the Fc modification (Navid et al., 2010).
In fact, results from studies conducted with this antibody in vivo
will be interesting regarding anti-tumor effects caused by ADCC
as single mode of action without involvement of any other effector
mechanisms.
In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and pediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) donor versus recipient NK cell
alloreactivity is a key mechanism after HLA mismatched, hap￾loidentical SCT, and has been reviewed elsewhere (Velardi et al.,
2012). These “unlicensed” NK cells are characterized in the autol￾ogous setting by lacking self-KIRs and are thought to be beneficial
in patients with neuroblastoma as well (Venstrom et al., 2009;
Delgado et al., 2010). Interestingly, a recent study investigating
the differential potential for ADCC of “licensed” and “unlicensed”
NK cells in neuroblastoma, showed that “unlicensed” NK cells
mediate ADCC most effectively against neuroblastoma cell lines
under inflammatory conditions (Tarek et al., 2012). Based on these
studies and our ongoing trial with HLA mismatched, haploiden￾tical stem cell transplanted neuroblastoma patients treated with
ch14.18/CHO we suggest that in the allogeneic, HLA mismatched
SCT setting, KIR receptor ligand incompatibility may have syn￾ergistic effects with subsequent antibody therapy and propose
further exploration of this hypothesis in larger clinical trials.
ENHANCED ADCC BY THIRD-GENERATION MONOCLONAL
ANTIBODIES
Presuming that ADCC is a key mediator of anti-tumor effects
in vivo, enhancing ADCC by engineering mAbs is expected to
markedly improve clinical efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Two
main approaches of optimizing FcγRIIIa binding by enhancing
the affinity of mAbs have been suggested and shown to induce
5- to 100-fold increased ADCC in vitro in recent years: molecular
modifications in the Fc portion leading to aa substitutions (Shields
et al., 2001; Lazar et al., 2006; Stavenhagen et al., 2007) and mod￾ifying Fc-linked glycosylation (Umana et al., 1999; Davies et al.,
2001; Shinkawa et al., 2003).
The approach of optimizing the Fc portion of a therapeutic
antibody via aa substitutions predominantly intends to enhance
ADCC by increasing the affinity to activating FcγRIIIa and
reducing the affinity to inhibitory FcγRIIb. A considerable number
of these third-generation monoclonal antibodies are currently
under early clinical investigation. These therapeutic antibodies
target among others CD19, CD20, CD30, CD40, and FLT3 in
hematological malignancies and all of them aim at achieving
highly augmented ADCC in vivo (Awan et al., 2010; Foyil and
Bartlett, 2010; Horton et al., 2010; Le Garff-Tavernier et al., 2011;
Hofmann et al., 2012; Kellner et al., 2013). Furthermore, a CD19-
specific Fc-optimized therapeutic antibody is currently evaluated
in pediatric patients with refractory acute B-lineage leukemia after
allogeneic SCT within the scope of a compassionate use program
at our institution. In four out of six patients at very high risk of
relapse, minimal residual disease could be significantly reduced
or completely eradicated with a longest follow up of 15 months
(unpublished data). Other attempts aim at reduction of CDC
related toxicity as applied in GD2 targeting hu14.18K322A in neu￾roblastoma (Lazar et al., 2006; Sorkin et al., 2010) or enhancing
affinity to low affinity allele FcγRIIIa-158F (Bowles et al., 2006;
Nordstrom et al., 2011). Recently, a phase I trial investigating a
Fc-engineered antibody targeting CD20 in follicular lymphoma
patients has suggested encouraging results even in patients with
the less favorable FcγRIIIa-F allotype (Forero-Torres et al., 2012).
Glyco-engineered therapeutic antibodies either bear oligosac￾charides modified by bisecting GlcNAc, a β1,4-GlcnAc residue
attached to a core β-mannose residue, or lack the core fucose of the
Fc oligosaccharides and have been found to exhibit significantly
higher ADCC than their unmodified counterparts (Lifely et al.,
1995; Shinkawa et al., 2003). These modifications of oligosaccha￾rides are mainly obtained by either transfecting CHO cell line
with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII) or eliminat￾ing its intrinsic α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) activity. Alter￾native expression systems such as Sf21 insect cells, resulting in
fucosylated paucimannosidic N-linked glycosylation, have been
suggested to elicit an enhanced ADCC and have been investigated
with a chimeric CD19 antibody at our institution (Lang et al.,
2004; Barbin et al., 2006). Several other glyco-engineered antibod￾ies targeting a variety of different tumor associated antigens like
CD19, CD20, EGFR, and GD2 are currently investigated in early
clinical studies (Robak, 2009; Navid et al., 2010; Paz-Ares et al.,
2011; Ward et al., 2011). All glyco-engineered antibodies in clini￾cal trials have been reviewed in more detail elsewhere (Beck and
Reichert, 2012). Recently, the C–C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)
targeting glyco-engineered antibody mogamulizumab has been
approved in Japan for use in patients with relapsed and refrac￾tory CCR4-positive adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) (Beck
and Reichert, 2012). Clinical superiority of these third-generation
mAbs over clinically established therapeutic antibodies remains
to be shown and may further portend the key role of ADCC for
clinical use.
CONCLUSION
The studies discussed here clearly demonstrate a substantial role
of ADCC in vitro and in mouse tumor models. However, the
direct in vivo effect of ADCC in tumor reactivity in humans
remains to be shown since no therapeutic antibody with ADCC
as single mechanism of action has been investigated in clini￾cal trials to date. Conflicting results have been obtained about
the role of FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism in mAb treatment.
Several studies have shown a predictive value, which underlines

Seidel et al. ADCC in tumor immunotherapy
the influence of ADCC in vivo and suggests that ADCC is one
of the key mechanisms for clinical efficacy of therapeutic anti￾bodies. On the other hand, some studies could not confirm
these results. Further studies investigating the clinical relevance
of FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism may be required for each
therapeutic antibody and its indications. Although additional
chemotherapy can mask the influence of the FcγRIIIa genotype
and may hamper ADCC due to impaired NK cell function, a
combination of both is able to improve clinical results. In partic￾ular, the use of therapeutic antibodies after hematopoietic SCT
is an interesting treatment option, as the new donor-derived
immune system usually faces minimal tumor burden. Further
exploration of the role of the FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism and
the influence of KIR-receptor-ligand incompatibility on ADCC in
allogeneic hematopoietic SCT may contribute to future transplan￾tation strategies in this setting. Furthermore, clinical superiority
of ADCC improved third-generation mAbs over clinically estab￾lished second-generation antibodies remains to be shown and may
further portend the key role of ADCC in cancer therapy with
monoclonal antibodies.
