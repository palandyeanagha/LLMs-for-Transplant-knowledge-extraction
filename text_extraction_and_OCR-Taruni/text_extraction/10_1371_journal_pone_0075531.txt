Abstract
Background: A risk score for invasive mold disease (IMD) in patients with hematological malignancies could
facilitate patient screening and improve the targeted use of antifungal prophylaxis.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,709 hospital admissions of 840 patients with hematological malignancies
(2005-2008) to collect data on 17 epidemiological and treatment-related risk factors for IMD. Multivariate regression
was used to develop a weighted risk score based on independent risk factors associated with proven or probable
IMD, which was prospectively validated during 1,746 hospital admissions of 855 patients from 2009-2012.
Results: Of the 17 candidate variables analyzed, 11 correlated with IMD by univariate analysis, but only 4 risk
factors (neutropenia, lymphocytopenia or lymphocyte dysfunction in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
recipients, malignancy status, and prior IMD) were retained in the final multivariate model, resulting in a weighted risk
score 0-13. A risk score of < 6 discriminated patients with low (< 1%) versus higher incidence rates (> 5%) of IMD,
with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.99, (95% CI 0.98-0.99). During 2009-2012, patients with a calculated risk
score at admission of < 6 had significantly lower 90-day incidence rates of IMD compared to patients with scores > 6
(0.9% vs. 10.6%, P <0.001).
Conclusion: An objective, weighted risk score for IMD can accurately discriminate patients with hematological
malignancies at low risk for developing mold disease, and could possibly facilitate “screening-out” of low risk patients
less likely to benefit from intensive diagnostic monitoring or mold-directed antifungal prophylaxis.

Introduction
Invasive mold diseases (IMDs) such as aspergillosis, and
less commonly mucormycosis and fusariosis are a serious
complication of myelosuppressive chemotherapy administered
for hematological malignancies [1-3]. Patients undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or
remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous
leukemia / myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) are at
especially high risk, with 20-fold higher rates of aspergillosis
compared to patients with underlying lymphoma or multiple
myeloma [4]. Although diagnostic advances and new antifungal
therapies have improved survival rates in patients with invasive
aspergillosis [1], nearly one-third of patients still die with the
infection, or have interruption of life-saving chemotherapy while
the mold infection is being treated [1]. As a result, many
hematologists routinely screen patients for incipient mold
infection with the serum galactomannan test and high
resolution computer tomography if the patient has fever, or
administer mold-active antifungal prophylaxis for prolonged
periods even though only a small proportion of patients
(4-12%) may go on to develop a mold infection [5,6].
Risk stratification for IMD is a logical first step for identifying
which patients would most likely benefit from more intensive
monitoring or antifungal prophylaxis [7,8]. However, the
development of an IMD risk prediction model in patients with
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e75531

hematological malignancies is complicated by the low overall
disease prevalence, infrequently analyzed genetic risk factors
related to host innate immunity, and dynamic clinical and
environmental variables during their course of treatment [8,9].
Nevertheless, we hypothesized that an objective risk score for
hematology patients based on easily documented demographic
and clinical risk factors could have clinical utility if it accurately
discriminates populations at low versus higher risk for
developing IMD.
As a first step towards this goal, we retrospectively analyzed
17 candidate epidemiological and clinical risk factors for IMD in
840 patients during 2005-2008 to develop an objective risk
score for proven or probable IMD. We then prospectively
evaluated the performance of this risk score in 855 patients
from 2009-2012. We found that a weighted risk score for IMD
accurately discriminated a cohort of hematology patients at low
(
< 1% incidence) versus higher (> 5% incidence) risk for mold
infection, irrespective of the underlying malignancy, transplant
status, and use of mold-active antifungal prophylaxis.
Design and Methods
Ethics statement
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki, following review by the S’Orsola-Malpighi￾University of Bologna ethics committee (http://www.aosp.bo.it/
content/comitato-etico). Full review was waived because of the
non-interventional, observational nature of the study. As a
standard protocol in our institute, all patients included in the
study provided an informed consent the first day of
hospitalization.
Study Population
This study was performed at a single regional hematology
center in Italy (Institute of Hematology and Clinical Oncology
“Lorenzo e Ariosto Seràgnoli”, University of Bologna) during
two periods. In the first study period (March 2005-December
2008), consecutive hospital admissions of patients with
hematological malignancies were retrospectively analyzed for
infections and IMD risk factors to develop a multivariate risk
model for IMD. During the second study period (January 2009-
December 2012), the performance of the risk score was
prospectively analyzed in patients with a risk score calculated
at the time of hospital admission, which was not reported to the
treating hematologist. For each patient hospitalization, only the
first infection episode was included in the analysis. Patients
with hospitalizations shorter than 6 days were excluded from
the analysis.
We collected data on 17 candidate predictors for IMD, which
had been previously reported in the literature as risk factors for
IMD in patients with hematological malignancies (Table 1).
Additional data pertinent to each hospitalization and infection
episode were collected from clinical records and registered on
a standardized data collection form by the treating
hematologist, while demographic data were extracted from an
institutional centralized database. The accuracy of collected
data was confirmed by a quality control procedure during data
entry and with periodic reviews by 4 physicians (2
hematologists, 1 infectious diseases specialist, and 1
radiologist).
Study endpoint
The primary endpoint used for score development was
documentation of proven or probable IMD within 90 days of
hospitalization. Possible, probable or proven invasive
aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mold disease (IMD) was defined
according to the revised Mycoses Study Group and European
Organization and Treatment of Cancer consensus criteria [10].
Serum galactomannan testing was routinely available at our
institute after January 2007. Before this period, typical
radiographic criteria as described by Cornely et al., were used
to classify patients with proven or probable invasive
aspergillosis [11]. In the case of non-Aspergillus molds not
detected by galactomannan screening, diagnosis was always
confirmed by histology or culture. Fluconazole (400 mg daily)
was routinely administered to all patients undergoing allogeneic
HSCT. Decisions regarding anti-mold antifungal prophylaxis in
either non-transplant or transplant patients were at the
discretion of the physicians caring for the patient.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic data were collected as either continuous data
and compared by two-tailed unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney
test, or as categorical variables and compared by Chi-square
test for patients with or without a probable or proven IMD.
Variables with more than 5% missing data were excluded from
analysis. Significant variables (P<0.05) were entered stepwise
in a multivariate logistic regression model to evaluate the
relationship between each variable and IMD risk using the
Wald’s statistic. Variables that maintained statistical
significance by multivariate regression were then assigned a
point value corresponding to the β-coefficient of that variable
divided by the lowest β-coefficient of variables remaining in the
regression model, and the resulting quotient was multiplied by
two and rounded to the nearest whole number. Summation of
the points resulted in a weighted risk score that was assigned
to each patient episode retrospectively (2005-2008), or
prospectively (2009-2012) at the time of hospital admission.
The relationship of the calculated risk score and IMD risk
was subsequently analyzed by receiver operator curves (ROC)
to define an optimal cut-off score that discriminated low, versus
high-risk patients. Our provisional cut-off was a risk score
associated with 5% incidence of IMD, which has been
proposed as the lower incidence limit of Aspergillus infection
justifiable for antifungal prophylaxis in hematology patients [12].
All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20
(IBM, Armonk, NY) and MedCalc 12.5 (Ostend, Belgium).

(31%), lymphoma (29%), and multiple myeloma/amyloidosis
(25%) of which 63% were in partial or complete remission.
Nearly 40% of the hospitalizations were for chemotherapy
alone (i.e. no evidence of fever or infection on admission) with
46% of these admissions proceeding to HSCT (34%
autologous, 12% allogeneic). Characteristics of the 1,709
cases are summarized in Table 2.
During the prospective score validation study period
(2009-2012), we analyzed 1,746 hospital admissions in 855
hematology patients. Each patient contributed a median of 1
hospitalization episode (range 1-10) to the database. The
breakdown of underlying malignancies in the prospectively
studied cohort was similar to the retrospective cohort.
However, significantly fewer patients in 2009-2012 were
admitted with chronic myelogenous leukemia (0.3% vs. 3%,
P<0.001) or multiple myeloma/amyloidosis (14% vs. 24%
P=0.001). Admissions associated with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (4% vs. 1%, P<0.001) and lymphoma (36% vs. 29%
P=0.02) were slightly higher during 2009-2012. Additionally, a
higher proportion of hospital admissions in prospectively
studied patients were for induction (19% vs. 9%, P<0.001) or
maintenance/ salvage chemotherapy (24% vs. 13%, P<0.001);
reflecting the activation of new protocols in our institute during
2009-2012. Fewer patients in 2009-2012 received an
autologous HSCT (20% vs. 34%, P<0.001), although rates of
allogeneic HSCT were similar between the two study periods
(13% vs. 12%, P=0.34).
Anti-mold antifungal prophylaxis was used more frequently in
2009-2012 (20% vs. 11%, P<0.001), which was largely
attributed to the introduction use of posaconazole after 2009
(Table 2). The increased use of anti-mold prophylaxis was
associated with a corresponding decrease in empirical
antifungal therapy for molds (8% vs. 14%, P<0.001). The most
common anti-mold antifungal prophylaxis used during
2005-2008 was itraconazole capsules or solution (10%), which
was largely replaced by posaconazole during 2009-2012
(11.4%) with some continued itraconazole use (8%).
Voriconazole, lipid amphotericin B formulations, or aerosolized
amphotericin B formulations were infrequently administered as
prophylaxis during either study period (all less than 1%).
Risk Factors Associated with Proven or Probable IMD
Among the 17 candidate variables evaluated in the
retrospective cohort, 11 were associated with IMD by univariate

factors, the status of the underlying hematologic malignancy,
variables related to the severity of underlying
immunosuppression, a prior history of IMD, as well as the
admission to a non-HEPA air-filtered room. However, in
multivariate regression, only 4 of the 11 variables were
independently associated with IMD risk: 1) Prolonged

Points assigned on the basis of the weighted odds ratios for
these 4 independent variables resulted in a risk score from
0-13 for each patient (mean 3.3, 95% CI 3.1-3.4) (Table 4).
Risk scores were well calibrated with observed rates of IMD
(Figure 1). When risk scores and the rates of true-positive and
false-positive IMD rates were analyzed by ROC curves (Figure
2), a score of less than 6 was found to be optimal cut-off for
discriminating low-risk patients with an area under the ROC
curve (aROC) of 0.84 (0.79-0.89), sensitivity 0.86 (0.77-0.95),

within 90 days or hospital discharge. The mean risk score in
2009-2012 (mean 3.1, 95% CI 3.0-3.3) did not differ
significantly from patients analyzed from 2005-2008. Similar to
the retrospective cohort, risk scores for patients studied during

discriminating low-risk patients in the prospective study cohort,
with an aROC of 0.84 (0.82-0.86), sensitivity of 0.80
(0.67-0.89), specificity 0.76 (0.74-0.78), PPV 0.10 (0.07-0.13)
and NPV 0.99 (0.99-1.0). When the risk score performance
was analyzed in different subgroups of hematological
malignancy patients with varying IMD prevalence (1.5% to
10.6%) and rates of anti-mold prophylaxis use (7.2% to 57%),
we found that a score of < 6 consistently identified a cohort of
patients at low risk for IMD with NPVs ranging from 0.96-0.99
(Table 5).
Impact of Posaconazole Prophylaxis
Posaconazole prophylaxis reduces the incidence of IMD in
high-risk hematology patients and was associated with a
mortality benefit in AML/MDS patients receiving remission￾induction chemotherapy [13,14]. We examined rates of proven
or probable IMD among patients who had received
posaconazole with risk scores of < 6 versus > 6 (Figure 3a).
Posaconazole prophylaxis was not associated with any
discernable benefit in terms of reducing the incidence of IMD in
patients with risk scores of < 6. However, among higher-risk
patients with scores > 6, posaconazole prophylaxis was
associated with a 7.8% risk reduction in IMD (P=0.01). We also
found that among 131 individual patients with AML/MDS
undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy during
2009-2012, patients who received posaconazole prophylaxis
had a significantly lower risk of crude mortality within 6 weeks
of hospitalization [15], versus patients who did not receive

posaconazole (Figure 3b) (HR 0.43, 0.2-0.9, P=0.04). This
mortality difference was evident despite identical median risk
scores (7) in patients who received and did not receive
posaconazole prophylaxis.
Discussion
Physicians must weigh multiple factors when considering a
patient’s risk for developing IMD [16,17]. Prognostic models or
risk scores can complement this clinical assessment by
providing an objective summation of multiple risk factors,
thereby clarifying which patients should be targeted for more
aggressive intervention [18]. To our knowledge, our single￾Figure 2. Analysis of risk score discrimination and optimal cut-off for invasive model disease risk. (a) Receiver-operator
curve (ROC) analysis plot of the true positives plotted as a function of the false-positives (100-specificity) at different cutoffs of the
risk score. Gray bands represent the 95% CI of the plot. The dotted line represents a reference line no discrimination for invasive
mold disease (aROC=0.5). The P value is the probability that the aROC differs significantly from aROC=0.5; (b) Plot of sensitivity
and specificity versus risk score. The highest sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) meet at a score just
below 6, suggesting a criterion value of > 6.

institution study represents the first attempt to develop and
validate an unconditional risk model for IMD in a
heterogeneous population of patients with hematological
malignancies. Our data demonstrate that an objective weighted
risk score could reliably discriminate patients who had a very
low probability of developing IMD within 90 days of
hospitalization, and thus may be candidates for more
conservative management with respect to higher-risk patients.
An ideal risk score for IMD in patients would have both a
high negative predictive value (NPV) and high positive
predictive value (PPV). Yet, development of such a risk score
that could be applied for routine screening of a heterogeneous
population of hematology patients is challenging, given the
overall low prevalence of IMD and fluctuating risk factors for
infection [8]. Alternatively, a risk score could be developed in a
more homogenous high-risk population of with a higher
prevalence of IMD (
> 5%), such as allogeneic HSCT or AML/MDS patients
undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy. Risk scores
targeting populations who have already been shown to have
proven to benefit from antifungal prophylaxis or intensive
monitoring, however, may have less clinical utility for routine
patient care [18] or considered too restrictive by treating
physicians [19].
A limitation of our study is that our risk score was devised
from observational data in a single center, and could not
control for “real life” confounding factors such as use of
antifungal prophylaxis. Notably, the discriminative performance
of the risk score in our institution was similar among various
subgroups of hematology malignancy patients with varying risk
for IMD and usage patterns of antifungal prophylaxis. However,
the performance of our risk score will undoubtedly vary in other
hospitals depending on the type of patients treated and the
baseline incidence of IMD. Additionally, clinical risk factors for
IMD such as graft versus host disease and corticosteroids,
which were not retained in our final risk model, would likely be
more important if the score was developed specifically in
allogeneic HSCT patients. Therefore multicenter validation and
center-specific adjustments would likely be required if the risk
score was applied to the clinical management of IMD in other
hospitals.
In conclusion, we found than an objective, weighted risk￾score for IMD could reliably discriminate the large majority of
patients with hematological malignancies who were at low-risk
for developing IMD. The discriminative performance of the
score was consistent across various hematology patient
subtypes with varying underlying baseline risk for IMD and
exposure to antifungal prophylaxis. The continued refinement
and multicenter validation of IMD risk scores could complement
the clinical assessment of patients with hematological
malignancies, and possibly improve the targeted use of
