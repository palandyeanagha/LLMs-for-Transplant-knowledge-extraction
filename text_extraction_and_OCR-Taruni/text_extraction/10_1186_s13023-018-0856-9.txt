Abstract
Background: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare hereditary condition that leads to decreased circulating
alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, significantly increasing the risk of serious lung and/or liver disease in children and
adults, in which some aspects remain unresolved.
Methods: In this review, we summarise and update current knowledge on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in order to
identify and discuss areas of controversy and formulate questions that need further research.
Results: 1) AATD is a highly underdiagnosed condition. Over 120,000 European individuals are estimated to have
severe AATD and more than 90% of them are underdiagnosed.
Conclusions: 2) Several clinical and etiological aspects of the disease are yet to be resolved. New strategies for
early detection and biomarkers for patient outcome prediction are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality in
these patients; 3) Augmentation therapy is the only specific approved therapy that has shown clinical efficacy in
delaying the progression of emphysema. Regrettably, some countries reject registration and reimbursement for this
treatment because of the lack of larger randomised, placebo-controlled trials. 4) Alternative strategies are currently
being investigated, including the use of gene therapy or induced pluripotent stem cells, and non-augmentation
strategies to prevent AAT polymerisation inside hepatocytes.

Background
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare hereditary
condition characterised by low circulating levels of the
alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, a serine protease
inhibitor synthesised and secreted mainly by hepatocytes,
that protects lung tissues from damage caused by proteo￾lytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase (NE). The AAT
protein is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene and over 120
mutations have been reported at this locus [1, 2]. The
commonest deficiency variants are the S and Z forms (as
opposed to the normal wild-type M allele). The Z allele
(both in homozygosis and heterozygosis) leads to misfold￾ing and polymerisation of the protein, which accumulates
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the hepatocytes,
leading to chronic liver disease in some individuals.
Hepatocyte damage is believed to be caused by ER stress,
ER overload response, mitochondrial dysfunction and
autophagy, although the pathophysiology is still unclear.
Some AAT mutations (those that destabilise the protein
dramatically) do not polymerise and cause ER stress, trig￾gering the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD)
system and the unfolded protein response (UPR), (Fig. 1)
whereas mutations that cause ordered polymerisation of
the protein (such the Z allele) trigger an ER overload
response that involves calcium-dependent nuclear factor
(NF)-κB signalling and a pro-inflammatory response. The
S mutated protein is retained within the hepatocytes

although it does not form intrahepatic polymers unless
the Z allele is present in keeping with less retention in the
hepatocytes, absence of liver disease and intermediate
plasma levels [3–5]. Although much of the misfolded
protein is eliminated either by ERAD or by autophagy, a
proportion is folded correctly and secreted into the
circulation [6]. As a consequence, lower circulating
plasma levels of AAT are found in patients with AATD,
resulting in incapacity to inhibit NE efficiently. This
leads to parenchymal lung destruction and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) development, a
situation that is exacerbated by smoking and occupa￾tional exposure to dust and fumes [1, 7, 8]. In rare
cases, AATD has also been associated with other
conditions such as necrotising panniculitis and systemic
vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis; GPA) al￾though this connection is less well established since a
variety of genotypes, some with circulating values in
the normal range, are associated with GPA [7, 9, 10].
Recent research has shown that AATD is characterised
by neutrophilic inflammation and the disease is increas￾ingly recognised as a neutrophil-driven inflammatory
disorder both in the lung and with other systemic mani￾festations [11]. Beyond its antiprotease activity, AAT has
anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features which
open up a rationale for its potential use in other inflam￾matory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes
mellitus, cystic fibrosis and asthma [12–14].
Fig. 1 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) initiation. Properly folded proteins (Green arrows) are
processed at the Golgi apparatus and then translocated to their destination sites. Misfolded proteins (Red arrows) are retained in the ER lumen
and are degraded by the ER-associated protein degradation machinery (ERAD). Under certain pathological situations misfolded proteins
aggregate and accumulate into the ER lumen triggering a condition called ER stress (Blue arrows). In response to ER stress, the cell activates the
Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), in which accumulated misfolded proteins are sensed by inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating factor 6
(ATF6) and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) proteins. IRE1 protein dimerises, auto-phosphorylates and activates its
endoribonuclease activity, which removes a small intron of the transcription factor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1u) that is then converted in
XBP1s which acts as a transcriptional activator. ATF6 is cleaved and activated in the Golgi apparatus to yield a transcription factor (ATF6c) that
migrates to the nucleus where activates the transcription of UPR target genes. PERK also dimerises and phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation
initiation 2α (eIF2α), which attenuates most translation but stimulates translation of the transcription factor ATF4, which in turn activates genes to
protect cells against the ER stress. The UPR signalling consists of four mechanisms: i) decreased translation to prevent further misfolded protein
accumulation; ii) induction of ER chaperones to increase folding capacity; iii) induction of ERAD genes to increase degradation of misfolded
proteins and iv) induction of apoptosis to remove stressed cells

AATD is a highly underdiagnosed condition. Since the
first symptoms resemble other respiratory pathologies,
initial clinical diagnosis can be difficult especially in
neonates and children [2]. A recent study has estimated
the frequency of the PIS and PIZ alleles in 97 countries
worldwide; more than 180,000 (0.1%) and 1.2 million
(0.7%) individuals are estimated to have PIZZ and PISZ
phenotypes respectively, most of them remaining
undiagnosed [9, 15–17]. Early diagnosis is important to
allow physicians to take preventive measures and initiate
appropriate treatment when necessary [18]. Clinical data
indicates that the severity of the symptoms found in
AATD patients is highly variable and neither AAT serum
levels nor phenotype are sufficient to identify which
patients will develop severe lung or liver disease [19].
New strategies for early detection and biomarkers for
patient outcome prediction are therefore needed to
reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients.
Augmentation therapy is the only specific approved
therapy to treat the pulmonary disease in patients with
severe AATD [20]. However, the use of this therapy is con￾troversial [21]. New treatment options are currently being
investigated, including the use of gene therapy or induced
pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), and non-augmentation strat￾egies to prevent AAT polymerisation inside hepatocytes.
In the light of the above, the AATD field is rapidly
evolving with new and exciting discoveries. In order to
summarise the current knowledge, identify areas of
controversy and formulate questions that need further
research a review of the scientific literature on AATD
has been undertaken with a particular focus on recent
advances in the field.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: A Paediatricians’
perspective
From a respiratory point of view, AATD is generally an
adult-onset condition, so that there are usually no notable
clinical differences between children with or without
AATD. Recurrent respiratory manifestations in a child
diagnosed with AATD are not necessarily caused by the
disease, but may be an exacerbating factor in the
progression of an underlying respiratory problem [22].
Therefore, paediatricians should aim to prevent respira￾tory infections and control the signs or symptoms of
bronchial hyper-reactivity in these patients by administer￾ing the appropriate vaccines indicated for the child’s age,
including hepatitis A and B, pneumococcal 13-valent vac￾cines, and an annual influenza vaccine.
Although AATD-associated liver disease can present
from birth to old age, AATD is the most frequent cause of
metabolic liver disease in paediatric patients [23–25] and
the second most common indication for liver transplant￾ation after biliary atresia [26]. The clinical course of
AATD-related liver disease is highly variable and it is still
unknown why some individuals develop AATD-related
liver disease while others do not [27]. The majority of
infants with homozygous severe AATD (PiZZ) are asymp￾tomatic and clinically recover in early childhood; however,
about 10–50% develop some form of liver abnormality, in￾cluding elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic neonatal hepa￾titis, hepatomegaly and nutritional problems which may
persist throughout childhood [28, 29]. Results from the
Swedish newborn screening study have shown that the
risk of life-threatening liver disease in childhood is
approximately 5% [29]. In fact, only 2–3% develop fibrosis
or cirrhosis requiring transplantation during childhood
[30]. A recent systematic literature review was performed
aimed at providing clarification on the clinical course of
AATD in children and adults and to assess the clinical
effectiveness of liver transplantation [27]. In children, liver
cirrhosis was reported in 7.5% of patients, abnormal liver
function tests in 9%, portal hypertension in 6.9%, jaundice
in 1.9% and liver transplantation in 16.5%. No cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma were reported, suggesting that it
is a rare event. Risk factors for liver disease development
such as serum bilirubin, pattern of clinical jaundice, portal
hypertension and bile duct proliferation have been identi￾fied, but no clear pattern has been established. Mortality
ranged from 0% in a small study of 10 PIZZ children who
develop neonatal cholestasis and were followed until
20 years of age, to 25.5% in a cohort of 98 PIZZ/PISZ
patients. Data also indicate that mortality due to
AATD-associated liver disease has significantly decreased
since the end of the 1980s, when liver transplantation
became standard practice to treat patients with terminal
illness associated with liver disease, and outcomes follow￾ing liver transplantation were excellent regarding survival
(74 to 92%) and quality of life in survivors, with no recur￾rence of liver disease or pulmonary complications, indicat￾ing that liver transplantation is an effective treatment for
liver disease due to AATD [27].
These data, together with the fact that AATD is an auto￾somal codominant congenital disease, mean that paedia￾tricians should aim to diagnose the disease in: i) all infants
with persistent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated
transaminases, neonatal hepatitis syndrome, or other
evidence of liver damage; ii) older children with chronic
liver disease, cirrhosis, or portal hypertension; iii) children
of patients with AATD [31].
Diagnosis
Screening and laboratory and clinical diagnosis
Current recommendation documents and guidelines rec￾ommend/advise testing AAT levels in target populations,
including individuals with COPD regardless of age or
ethnicity, unexplained chronic liver disease, necrotising
panniculitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or unex￾plained bronchiectasis, and parents, siblings, and
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 3 of 15

children, as well as the extended family of individuals
identified with an abnormal gene for AAT. In these
latter cases, AAT level testing alone is not recommended
because it does not fully characterise disease risk from
AATD although some guidelines advocate both AAT
plasma levels and genotype for at least the S and Z
alleles as initial testing [32–34].
Despite these recommendations AATD is a largely
under-recognised condition [35]. Patients experience long
diagnostic delays (up to 5.6 years) and often visit several
doctors before the definitive diagnosis is reached [36].
With fewer than 10% of affected individuals being clinic￾ally diagnosed, AATD targeted detection is key to identify￾ing potential cases [37]. Improving the use of this targeted
detection starts by raising physician awareness [35].
Although typical cases tend to present at younger ages
with lower lobe emphysema, in reality there is no single
patient characteristic that can help raise suspicion: AATD
cases have been detected in patients with different types
of COPD, bronchiectasis, asthma, and in non-smoking
individuals [38]. Newborn screening has several pros and
cons and is currently not recommended, with the possible
exception of countries with a high prevalence of AATD
and smoking, where adequate counselling services are
available [39]. In a nationwide neonatal screening for
AATD carried out in Sweden between 1972 and 1974, 120
out of the 200,000 neonates screened were identified with
a PIZ phenotype [28]. Follow up of this study has shown
that the patients would rather know whether they are carry￾ing a mutation since reduced smoking rates and cigarette
smoke exposure in adulthood has been observed in patients
that were diagnosed with AATD at birth [40, 41]. Based on
these results and along with other considerations such as
the high prevalence of the disease (1:6000–3500 similar to
cystic fibrosis), the low cost of the diagnostic test, the diag￾nostic delay causing increased morbidity, and the existence
of a treatment to delay lung disease progression, some
authors consider that neonatal AATD diagnosis is appro￾priate [42]. On the other hand, other authors do not
support neonatal screening reasoning that the financial and
social costs outweigh the benefits and because there is no
specific treatment for liver disease, which is the leading
cause of childhood morbidity. Moreover, according to these
authors, the reported changes in smoking behaviour in
adulthood do not justify the social risks associated with
neonatal AATD screening, such as family stress and inabil￾ity to qualify for life insurance in some countries [43].
There is no single universally accepted laboratory algo￾rithm for AATD diagnosis. According to current recom￾mendations, quantitative serum AAT measurement in
stable COPD patients is used as the initial screening test
[38]. Recent publications have identified 104 mg/dL as a
cut-off value for detecting PiZZ individuals with a nega￾tive predictive value of 99.8% [44]. However, there may
be additional difficulties in identifying a threshold for
detecting heterozygous carriers [45]. When the serum
AAT concentration is lower than the reference range,
the study should be completed with phenotyping and/or
genotyping [46].
Stratification
Improved understanding of COPD pathogenesis together
with new and better diagnostic techniques and increased
clinicians’ awareness have shown that the clinical pres￾entation of AATD-related COPD is not limited to purely
emphysematous patients. Instead, as with non-AATD
tobacco-related COPD, there is a wide range of disease
presentations [47]. Accordingly, the confirmation of
AATD should be followed by evaluating the specific
clinical presentation in order to identify symptoms
intensity and prognostic markers [48, 49].
Multidimensional tools and scales for determining AATD
have been explored. The BODE (body mass index, airflow
obstruction, dyspnoea, and exercise capacity) index was
recently validated in a cohort of 191 AATD patients under￾going lung transplantation who were followed from 2006 to
2012. The authors found that the BODE index could better
discriminate survival than both forced expiratory volume in
one second (FEV1) alone and the 2011 Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification.
However, future trials will be required to elucidate the use￾fulness of the BODE index, or any other multidimensional
scales, for treatment selection [50].
Additionally, different health status questionnaires and
severity scores are available, including the St George’s
Respiratory Questionnaire, the COPD severity score, the
EuroQoL 5-Dimensions, the Living with COPD, and the
COPD Assessment Test. Recently, an observational,
cross-sectional study including 96 COPD patients (includ￾ing 35 cases of AATD-related COPD) evaluated some of
these questionnaires. Patients with AATD COPD showed a
similar degree of health status impairment as those with
non-AATD COPD. Additionally, there were stronger corre￾lations between AATD COPD health status measurements
and lung function impairment than for non-AATD COPD.
Therefore, evidence regarding the performance of different
questionnaires for more comprehensive evaluation of
AATD patients is starting to accumulate [51].
Prognosis
The natural history and prognosis of AATD is variable.
Most people with a severe deficiency have a lower life
expectancy relative to the general population [52, 53],
with the exception of never-smokers that were identified
through family or population screening [54]. The risk of
developing AATD-related diseases depends not only on
which AAT deficient alleles the individual carries, but
also on other factors and modifiers including genetic
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 4 of 15

polymorphisms that can modulate gene expression or
environmental factors such as smoking, air pollution
and dust exposure for lung disease or alcohol intake for
hepatic injury.
Early diagnosis (and treatment) is the key to improving
the prognosis of AATD-related disease [55], because it
promotes smoking cessation [56] preventing young indi￾viduals developing a smoking habit and raising aware￾ness to avoid exposure to occupational respiratory
pollutants [57].
Respiratory disease is the main prognostic factor for
most AATD patients and is predominantly represented by
early-onset emphysema (58–72%) [52, 53]. Cigarette
smoking has an adverse effect on the course of lung dis￾ease and is by far the single most important risk factor for
the development of rapidly progressive COPD in patients
with AATD [39, 58]. Epidemiological studies have shown
that ever-smokers with severe AATD have increased
emphysema, lower diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide
(DLCO) values and increased airflow obstruction and spu￾tum production than never-smokers [57, 59, 60]. Similarly,
active smokers have a greater annual loss of lung function
than never-smokers and ex-smokers [61, 62]. In a recent
study it was shown that PISZ patients were less suscep￾tible to cigarette smoke than PIZZ patients. Multivariate
analysis revealed that PISZ patients were less likely to have
emphysema and had better survival than PIZZ patients,
given the same level of smoke exposure, although the lung
function decline did not differ significantly [63].
The risk of lung disease in PIMZ individuals has been
controversial for years. This is of particular importance
because of the high prevalence of PIMZ individuals,
meaning that even a moderate increase in the risk of
COPD would have a significant public health impact. A
meta-analysis showed an increased risk of COPD among
PIMZ patients [64]. However, population-based studies
showed no significant differences in FEV1 values between
the PIMM and PIMZ groups, thus establishing an associ￾ation between PIMZ and the development of COPD was
complicated, partly due to the small number of patients
included in these studies. However, later studies including
a higher number of patients have demonstrated that
ever-smokers PIMZ heterozygotes have and increased risk
of COPD whereas there was no increased risk in never
smokers. Moreover, in a family-based study it was shown
that PIMZ individuals have a greater degree of airway
obstruction than PIMM individuals with a similar degree
of cigarette smoke exposure. Altogether, these results
indicate that intensive counselling and PIMZ diagnosis is
strongly advisable to avoid starting smoking in
non-smokers or to help current smokers quit [56, 65, 66].
The severity of AATD-related liver disease is also highly
variable. As noted above, it is the main clinical manifest￾ation at paediatric ages but it can also affect adults,
especially after the fifth decade of life, in some cases lead￾ing to severe forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma that may eventually require liver
transplantation. Approximately 50% of PiZZ homozygotes
show evidence of on-going inflammatory activity in the
liver, and 2 to 43% develop cirrhosis [67]. The risk for
adult liver disease increases with age. In a study analysing
the age distribution of AATD as a cause of severe liver
disease (as defined by the need for a liver transplant) the
authors found that 77.2% of the patients were adults, with
a peak age range of 50–64 years [68]. Several studies have
shown that individuals with PIMZ phenotype have an
increased risk of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis compared to the
general population although it seems that alcohol con￾sumption and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are important
factors in the development of liver disease in these
patients [27].
Interestingly, adults with severe lung disease often do
not develop liver disease and vice-versa. However, it has
been shown that in adults, hepatic disease can coexist with
pulmonary emphysema. In a study that included 57 pa￾tients with PiZZ AATD and established pulmonary dis￾ease, 63.2% had a history or clinical findings suggestive of
liver disease and 17.5% showed evidence of advanced liver
fibrosis [67].
Augmentation therapy: Advances and controversies
Intravenous infusion of AAT in AATD individuals pro￾tects the lungs from the action of uncontrolled neutrophil
elastase, and hence, slows the progression of emphysema
[69]. However, although augmentation therapy has proved
to have biochemical efficacy in reaching and maintaining
protective AAT levels in blood and lung tissue, its clinical
efficacy has been questioned [20]. Table 1 includes the
most relevant studies analysing the clinical efficacy of
AAT treatment.
Early studies had FEV1 decline and mortality as the prin￾cipal endpoint [62, 70–72] and they evidenced a reduction
in FEV1 decline in the treated group. Larger observational
studies showed that treatment with AAT augmentation
therapy resulted in a slower decline in FEV1 and a reduc￾tion in mortality compared to those not receiving this treat￾ment [70, 73, 74]. However, even though augmentation
therapy was beneficial, the reduction in lung function loss
was observed mainly for patients with a FEV1 between 35
and 60%, so this treatment was only recommended in pa￾tients that fall within this lung function-impairment range
[39, 62]. Recently, other medical societies have proposed
different criteria [38, 75].
One of the earlier randomised placebo-controlled trials
studied the change in pulmonary function tests and lung
density measured by CT, but only 30 patients were
included and the study showed no difference in the pul￾monary function tests. However, compared to the placebo
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 5 of 15

group the change in lung density tended to improve (p
< 0.07). The study showed that decline in FEV1 is not the
appropriate method to assess the efficacy of augmentation
therapy due to the large number of patients required [76].
Since then, the use of other markers such as DLCO or lung
density measured by computed tomography (CT) as alter￾native outcome metrics to FEV1 have been studied. More
recent studies have reported that a decline in DLCO is ob￾served before FEV1 decreases [77], and that both DLCO
and lung density (as measured by CT) demonstrate lung

parenchyma loss, even in severe disease where FEV1 may
be stable [78]. Moreover, lung density assessed by CT also
correlates with health-related quality of life (HRQL) and is
the best predictor of mortality in AATD patients [79]. The
EXACTLE randomised controlled trial [80] also evaluated
changes in CT lung density in patients receiving AAT aug￾mentation therapy versus placebo: the results were similar
to the previous study and, although the differences were
not significant, therapy also demonstrated a trend to im￾prove lung density (p = 0.068). Data from these two clinical
trials were pooled to increase the statistical power [81]
showing a significant improvement in lung density decline
(by 2.297 g/L in the treatment group) over two years in
treated versus untreated patients (p = 0.006).
Whereas in some countries these data were sufficient for
AAT augmentation treatment to become a registered treat￾ment, others reject registration and reimbursement be￾cause of the lack of larger randomised, placebo-controlled
trials. Indeed, despite several meta-analyses supporting the
use of augmentation therapy [75, 81, 82] an unfavourable
Cochrane review based on the rate of FEV1 decline [83] as
well as the lack of consensus encouraged the search for
new evidence. The RAPID trial gave additional information
for the efficacy of augmentation therapy. This trial in￾cluded 180 patients with emphysema secondary to AATD
and a FEV1 of 35–70% (predicted), recruited in 28 centres
in 13 countries [84]. The patients were randomised into
augmentation therapy or placebo and followed for two
years by CT densitometry. There was an additional exten￾sion in which all the patients received active treatment and
were followed for an additional two years (RAPID-OLE)
[85]. Primary endpoints in RAPID trial were CT lung
density at total lung capacity (TLC) and at functional
residual capacity (FRC) combined, and the two separately.
Although the primary endpoint of lung density at TLC and
FRC combined did not reach the statistical signifi￾cance (p = 0.06), changes in CT lung density at TLC
alone (another primary endpoint) showed a significant
difference in the rate of lung parenchymal loss be￾tween patients who received augmentation therapy
and those who received placebo (− 1.45 g/L per year
versus − 2.19 g/L per year; p = 0.03), with an absolute
difference of 0.75 g/L per year (95% CI: 0.06–1.42),
corresponding to a relative reduction of 34% in favour of
augmentation therapy. These results showed that augmen￾tation therapy was effective in reducing annual lung tissue
loss. Which was demonstrated by a statistically significant
reduction of lung density loss measured at a total lung
capacity (TLC) of 34% (p = 0.03). Moreover, patients who
were initially in the placebo arm and agreed to participate
in the extend study and subsequently received active treat￾ment for the next two years, showed a reduction in their
lung density decline rate similar to that of patients initially
included in the active arm of the study [85].
Some studies have showed a reduction on exacerbation
frequency and severity [86–88] in AATD patients under
augmentation therapy (Table 1). However, some inconsist￾encies have been observed in the results obtained from
these clinical trials indicating that further research is
needed to clarify this point [31].
Ongoing research and future treatments
Epigenetics and genetic modifiers
AATD symptoms and outcomes vary greatly, indicating
that beyond the protease-antiprotease imbalance other
genetic, epigenetic, and environmental and lifestyle factors
may contribute to disease severity. Epigenetics refers to
changes in gene expression not caused by DNA sequence
changes. At the molecular level, three distinct but intercon￾nected systems including DNA methylation, histone modi￾fication leading to chromatin remodelling, and non-coding
RNAs are involved in epigenetic gene expression regulation.
Understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the
initiation, maintenance, and hereditability of the epigenetic
changes observed in AATD is an important aspect of
current research in this field [89].
DNA methylation is by far the best-studied form of
epigenetic change. In one study, changes in the global
DNA methylation pattern and systemic inflammation
markers caused by cigarette smoke were analysed in 316
PiZZ AATD patients. The methylation levels of 16 CpG
sites were significantly associated with an ever-smoking
status, with all 16 being hypomethylated in this subset
compared with never-smokers. However, after adjusting
for age and sex, only one CpG site, in the transforming
growth factor, β-induced (TGFB1) gene, was associated
with ever-smoking. The same study found an association
between C-reactive protein levels and changes in CpG
sites in the runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3),
Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), and keratin-1 (KRT1) genes.
Taken together, these results indicate that ever-smoking
and age at smoking initiation is associated with both
global and specific gene hypomethylation, and suggest
that DNA methylation might be important in explaining
disease heterogeneity [90]. Similarly, DNA methylation
was associated with both the presence and severity of
COPD in two family-based cohorts comprising 1.085
and 369 subjects, respectively. Although none of the
subjects included in the studies were PIZZ a hypomethy￾lation of the SERPINA1 gene at loci cg02181506 was
associated with COPD and with poor lung-function
phenotypes [91]. Additionally, the methylation patterns
and AAT gene expression were studied in two series of
somatic cell hybrids between a rat hepatoma line and
human fetal liver fibroblasts or human skin fibroblasts.
The results indicate a clear correlation of hypomethyla￾tion with increased AAT gene expression, while inactive
AAT genes were highly methylated. Nevertheless, the
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 7 of 15

functional meaning of this change is currently unknown
in humans [92]. Altogether, these studies show a link
between changes in the DNA methylation pattern and
phenotype and severity of AATD.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding,
single-stranded RNA molecules which act at the
post-transcriptional level and play key roles in regulating
gene expression. So far, the role of miRNAs in AATD
has been very little studied. miRNA expression and
function were analysed in monocytes isolated from both
symptomatic and asymptomatic PiMM and PiZZ indi￾viduals. The authors described a group of 43 differen￾tially expressed miRNAs and showed that miR-199a-5p
may be an important regulator of both unfolded protein
response and inflammation in AATD. These investiga￾tors showed that miR-199a-5p is the most up-regulated
miRNA in asymptomatic PiZZ vs. PiMM monocytes, but
conversely, miR-119a-5p expression was decreased in
symptomatic PiZZ patients, a process mediated by
hypermethylation of the miR-119a-2 promoter [93, 94].
In a recent study, gene and miRNA expression were
analysed in PBMCs of a small group of PIZZ-AATD
patients with severe (n = 6) and mild (n = 6) COPD. The
authors identified that patients with severe COPD–
AATD disease presented 205 differentially expressed
mRNAs (114 upregulated and 91 downregulated) and 28
miRNAs (20 upregulated and 8 downregulated)
compared to patients with mild disease. Of these
down-regulated miRNAs in severe emphysema patients,
miR-486 and miR-335 have previously been related to
respiratory diseases. Downregulation of miR-335 in￾volves the activation of pathways related to inflammation
and angiogenesis. Therefore, these results suggest a
correlation between decreased miR-335 expression and
severity of AATD-related emphysema. However, this
finding must be confirmed in large studies including a
control group of patients with non- AATD–related
COPD. [95]. Overall, these studies provide additional in￾formation on the role of miRNA in AATD, which is re￾lated to the development and progression of the disease.
As previously mentioned, AATD is caused by mutations
in the AAT gene leading to protein misfolding. Proper
protein folding is carried out by a complex network of
proteins and pathways called the proteostasis network, a
process regulated by several signalling pathways including
the oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory signalling
pathways and the acetylation proteostasis system. Histone
acetyltransferase and deacetylases (HDACs) have been
shown to play important roles in liver and lung physiology
by modifying the acetylation–deacetylation equilibrium,
including in AATD. One report described correcting the
Z form of AAT secretion in response to treatment with
the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
(SAHA) which restored Z-AAT secretion and serpin
activity to 50% of wild-type AAT levels, thus suggesting
that SAHA may be a potential treatment for AATD [96].
Several studies have shown that OS may be involved in
the pathogenesis of AATD. Recent studies by our research
group have shown that OS produced by a reduction of
antioxidant defences is involved in the pathophysiology of
AATD at early ages, before relevant clinical manifestations
have occurred, and is associated with a higher risk of
developing lung and/or liver disease [97]. Further studies
demonstrated that increased OS leads to telomere
attrition in AATD patients and an association between
telomere length and AAT phenotypes, suggesting that
telomere length could be a promising biomarker for
AATD disease progression [98]. In a mouse model,
exposure to cigarette smoke accelerates polymerisation of
Z-AAT by oxidative modification of the AAT protein and
enhances the neutrophil influx into the lungs [99]. An￾other study using Hepa1.6 cells has shown that disulphide
interactions enhance intracellular accumulation of AAT,
while treatment of cells with reducing agents increase
Z-AAT secretion [100]. Altogether, these studies link
redox states with polymerisation and intracellular reten￾tion of AAT, suggesting that redox state is a modifier fac￾tor for AATD and that targeting OS may be a promising
therapeutic option for these patients [101, 102].
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the endo￾thelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) [103], glutathione
s-transferase p1 (GSTP1) [104, 105], tumour necrosis fac￾tor alpha (TNFA) [106], interleukin 10 (IL10) [107],
microsomal epoxy hydrolase (mEH) [105], cholinergic
nicotine receptor alpha3 (CHRNA3), and iron regulatory
binding protein 2 (IREB2) [108] genes have all been shown
to influence COPD development in AATD patients [108].
Biomarkers
Biomarkers which can act as an indicator of normal lung or
liver physiology, disease progression, or response to AAT
augmentation therapy, are being evaluated in the AATD
field [109]. Serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) is
used in clinical practice as a marker of liver disease. It is
transiently elevated in PIZ children although it is a bad
predictor of future liver problems in AATD patients [97,
98, 110]. Recent research has shown that serum GGT is
independently associated to the severity of lung disease and
respiratory mortality suggesting that might be a novel
marker for respiratory disease in AATD patients [111].
Desmosine and isodesmosine are well-studied lung
elastin degradation biomarkers which appear alongside
the development of COPD. Preliminary studies showed
that desmosine and isodesmosine levels in biofluids
(plasma, urine, and sputum) from COPD patients with or
without AATD are increased [112, 113]; one study also
showed evidence that AAT augmentation therapy dimin￾ished desmosine excretion in AATD patients [114].
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 8 of 15

Circulating polymers can be used to diagnose AATD
and are being investigated as prognostic biomarkers of the
disease. Current data indicate that they may be involved in
lung function decline in AATD patients. However, further
studies to establish the stability of circulating polymers
and its value as prognostic biomarkers are needed [115].
Fibrinogen has been recognised as a COPD biomarker
[116]. Fibrinogen levels are related to the presence and
frequency of exacerbations, disease severity and mortal￾ity in COPD patients [117]. Similarly, a specific blood
fibrinogen (Aa-Val360) degradation product is increased
in AATD patients, indicating airflow obstruction sever￾ity, and decreases in subjects receiving AAT augmenta￾tion therapy [118]. Results so far indicate that it may be
a useful disease activity marker in patients with early
disease in whom therapeutic intervention may be
indicated [119].
Beyond their role as regulatory molecules, miRNAs are
also being investigated as disease biomarkers in several
lung [120] and liver pathologies [121]. In a preliminary
study, plasma miRNA profile analysis in AATD individ￾uals revealed a genetic signature that discriminate between
the different AATD risk groups [122].
Emerging therapeutic strategies
AAT augmentation therapy requires regular intravenous
infusion of plasma-purified AAT, which is costly and
Fig. 2 Genome editing with engineered nucleases. Genome editing involves two steps: i) a nuclease is engineered to cleave a specific (target)
sequence in the DNA creating a double strand break (DSB); ii) the cell’s ability to repair the DSB by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) causes
a deletion in the target gene that can result in gene mutation or complete knockout whereas homology-directed repair (HDR) by homologous
recombination using a homologous DNA template results in gene correction or insertion depending on the DNA donor structure. There are
three main classes of engineered nucleases. a Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) consist of a DNA-binding macro-domain designed to target the
sequence of interest that is composed of several zinc-fingers each one recognising three nucleotides in the target sequence and linked to the
nuclease domain of the FokI restriction enzyme. After dimerisation of two ZFNs in inverse orientation and with an optimal spacing of 5–7
nucleotides, the dimeric FokI cleaves the DNA between the binding sites. b Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have a similar
structure to that of ZFNs. The TALEN DNA-binding macro-domain is composed of a tandem array of 34 aminoacids each recognising a single
nucleotide. Similarly to ZFNs, TALENs also depend on FoKI activity and dimerisation to create a DSB between the binding sites. c In the CRISPR￾Cas9 system, a site-specific DNA cleavage is performed by nuclease Cas9 directed by complementary between an engineered single guide RNA
(gRNA) and the target sequence
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 9 of 15

dependent on the availability of the protein. Therefore, alter￾native strategies are currently being investigated, including
new delivery strategies, the use of gene therapy or iPSCs,
non-augmentation strategies to prevent AAT polymerisation
inside hepatocytes, the use of autophagy-enhancing drugs
and silencing RNA strategies [123, 124].
Aerosol delivery is being investigated as an alternative,
more effective method to deliver AAT to the lung. Early
studies in humans have shown biochemical efficacy and
safety, although larger clinical trials are needed [125].
Replacement strategies using gene therapy in animal
models using viral [126] and non-viral gene [127, 128]
transfer methods were first reported years ago, but this
strategy would only be useful for treating emphysema
because it cannot be used to treat liver disease. However,
two recent studies using transgenic mouse AATD
models have shown that Z gene expression can be
knocked out while inserting the gene encoding wild type
(WT) AAT. High therapeutic levels of human AAT and
a simultaneous and significant reduction in the hepatic
accumulation of Z protein were observed, although the
reduction was not sufficient to prevent liver fibrosis
[129, 130]. The recent advent of efficient genome editing
based on zinc-finger nucleases, TALENs and the
CRISPR/Cas9 system has opened up new strategies for
definitive gene correction of the Z-AAT mutation in
hepatocytes, which are currently under investigation.
These techniques are based on chimeric endonucleases
targeted to a specific site within the genome, where a
double strand break (DSB) is provoked. The DSB can be
repaired either by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
or by homology directed repair (HDR) mechanisms. In
the NHEJ pathway, the break ends are ligated without
the need for a homologous DNA donor template leading
most of the times to gene inactivation. In contrast, HDR
is based on homologous recombination mechanisms and
requires a foreign DNA donor template with sufficient
homology to the genome on both sides of the region to
be modified to guide gene edition. These homologous
sequences can recombine into the chromosome,
Fig. 3 Strategies for delivery of engineered nucleases. a Cell-based (ex-vivo) approach. The therapeutic engineered nucleases are packaged into
a delivery vehicle (virus, liposomes, naked-DNA, etc). Cells from patient carrying the mutated non-functioning gene are isolated and transfected
with engineered nucleases to correct the mutated gene. Modified “healthy” cells are expanded in vitro and test for safety and off-target effects
before being re-administered to the patient. b Direct-delivery (in vivo) approach. In that case, the therapeutic engineered nucleases are packaged
into a delivery vehicle (virus, liposomes, naked-DNA, etc) and injected directly into the patient
Torres-Durán et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:114 Page 10 of 15

replacing the endogenous sequence with the new DNA
so that the desired genomic alteration (replacement,
insertion or deletion) can be achieved. This way, small
insertions or deletions -if NHEJ occurs- or specific
changes -if HDR occurs- can be introduced on the
genomic sequence of interest (Figs. 2 & 3) [131, 132].
However, before these techniques can be used in clinical
settings some key questions must be resolved. Some
aspects, such as targeted delivery to hepatocytes and opti￾misation of gene editing efficiencies to achieve physiological
effects, need further investigation. Another important as￾pect to be resolved is the prevention of the recent reported
off-targeted mutagenesis [133]. However, new methods to
improve gene editing specificity are under study and have
already yielded promising results [134, 135].
An alternative approach is to take advantage of the
higher proliferative capacity of WT-AAT hepatocytes over
their PiZZ counterparts; using a PiZZ mouse model, Ding
et al. demonstrated that WT hepatocytes can be trans￾planted to the diseased liver where they then substitute
PiZZ hepatocytes [136]. Building on this finding, the AAT
gene Z mutation has been corrected in hepatocyte-like
cells derived from iPSCs, and these cells were then trans￾planted into a mouse liver to produce sustained levels of
human AAT in vivo. However, this type of therapy also
carries the risk of introducing potentially harmful point
mutations, and the accumulation of epigenetic changes in
these cells cannot be excluded, which for now precludes
the use of this technique in clinical practice at this stage of
its development [137, 138].
Several strategies to prevent the polymerisation of
mutated forms are also currently being studied. One pep￾tide that targets a lateral hydrophobic area of the mutated
AAT-Z protein was found to prevent polymerisation,
although it increased intracellular degradation of the pro￾tein rather than inhibiting its secretion [123, 139, 140].
Similarly, reactive loop analogue peptides increase the
secretion rate of the mutated forms but seem to increase
their intracellular accumulation [140, 141].
Autophagy enhancement as a therapeutic alternative
to liver transplantation has attracted a lot of interest
recently. The autophagy-enhancing drugs carbamaze￾pine and rapamycin stimulate intracellular degradation
of misfolded Z-AAT and decrease hepatic fibrosis in a
mouse model of AATD-associated liver disease [142,
143]. Carbamazepine is currently being tested in
phase 2/3 pilot, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomised, clinical trial for severe liver disease at￾tributable to AATD [144].
Another non-augmentation strategy involves the use
of interference RNA (RNAi) to silence Z-AAT in hepato￾cytes. Preclinical data indicates that chronic silencing
reduces inclusion body formation and hepatic damage in
a mouse model of the disease [123].
Conclusions
In summary, AATD remains underdiagnosed. Therefore,
new strategies to enhance detection are needed, espe￾cially because available evidence supports the clinical
efficacy of augmentation therapy and promising new
alternative therapies are currently being investigated that
may change the panorama of treatment and disease over
the next few years. In addition, relevant biomarkers are
still needed to stratify patients to better predict disease
progression rates or monitor response to treatment. The
clinical utility of these biomarkers will increase as our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
emphysema moves forward.
