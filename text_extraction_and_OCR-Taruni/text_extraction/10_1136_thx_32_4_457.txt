32, 457-471. Hypoxia and hydrothoraces in a case of liver cirrhosis: correlation of physiological,
radiographic, scintigraphic, and pathological findings. A case is reported of liver cirrhosis
complicated by cyanosis and recurrent right hydrothorax. A diagnostic pneumoperitoneum
demonstrated that direct movement of ascites through a diaphragmatic defect was responsible
for the hydrothoraces. Pulmonary function tests between episodes of hydrothorax showed severe
arterial hypoxaemia, a 23% right-to-left shunt, and a reduction in the carbon monoxide transfer
factor to less than half of the predicted value. Evidence of abnormal intrapulmonary
arteriovenous communications was obtained by perfusion scanning. At necropsy the central
tendon of the diaphragm showed numerous areas of thinning which were easily ruptured.
Injection of the pulmonary arterial tree demonstrated precapillary arteriovenous anastomoses
and pleural spider naevi. A morphometric analysis provided quantitative evidence of pulmonary
vasodilatation limited to the intra-acinar arteries, consistent with the effect of a circulating
vasodilator. The scintigraphic and pathological findings suggested that shunting had been
greater in the right than the left lung. Examination of thin lung sections by light microscopy
showed that the walls of small veins were thickened, and electron microscopy showed that this
was due to a layer of collagen. The walls of capillaries were similarly thickened, which caused
an approximately two-fold increase in the minimum blood-gas distance and contributed to the
reduction in transfer factor.
Two respiratory complications may dominate the
clinical picture in patients with liver cirrhosis.
Some are deeply cyanosed due to a complex dis￾order of gas exchange. This includes right to left
shunting (Georg et al., 1960), ventilation-perfusion
inequality (Cotes et al., 1968) and reduction in the
transfer factor (Stanley and Woodgate, 1972).
Gross abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation
may be revealed by perfusion scanning (Stanley
et al., 1972) and during postmortem examination
of the lung vasculature (Berthelot et al., 1966).
Other patients develop hydrothoraces which are
often massive, recurrent and unilateral (Frothing￾ham, 1942). This paper presents a comparison of
physiological, isotopic and necropsy findings in a
case of liver cirrhosis with hypoxaemia and re￾current hydrothorax and provides some further
insight into their cause.
Case report
The patient, a woman of 45 years, was first ad￾mitted to the Central Middlesex Hospital in July
1973 with a four-week history of jaundice, dark
urine, and pale stools. There had been no ab￾dominal pain, but her alcohol intake had been
excessive and she had been treated with methyl￾dopa since the diagnosis of mild hypertension one
year earlier. She had smoked approximately 10
cigarettes per day. On physical examination there

was moderate hepatomegaly. Laboratory investiga￾tions revealed an obstructive jaundice (serum
bilirubin 720 ,umol/l, aspartate transaminase 63
IU/ml, and alkaline phosphatase 184 IU/ml) with
a negative mitochondrial antibody test. Laparo￾tomy revealed no anatomical defect of the biliary
system and an operative cholangiogram was nor￾mal. A liver biopsy showed an advanced micro￾nodular cirrhosis. Postoperatively she developed
ascites, but this resolved after salt restriction and
administration of a diuretic. Her cirrhosis was
presumed to be due to chronic alcoholism. The
cause of the cholestasis was uncertain but was
possibly related to the methyldopa therapy (Tog￾hill et al., 1974). After stopping the use of this
drug her blood pressure remained normal and the
jaundice gradually disappeared.
She was readmitted in June 1974 with an acute
onset of dyspnoea due to a massive right-sided
hydrothorax. There was also mild ascites and
ankle oedema. The pleural fluid had the character￾istics of a transudate. Its protein concentration
was 0-25 g/l; light microscopy revealed only meso￾thelial cells and bacterial cultures produced no
growth. A pleural biopsy and bronchoscopy
showed no abnormality. After an initial 1-5 1
thoracentesis she was given more intensive diure￾tic therapy and the hydrothorax disappeared. In
September and November 1974 she had two fur￾ther admissions due to recurrent right-sided hydro￾thoraces; on both occasions there was acute
respiratory distress. Between these episodes she
experienced moderate dyspnoea on effort, even
though physical and radiographic examinations
of the chest were normal. During the November
admission she was noticed to be cyanosed and to
have finger clubbing. There were no abnormal
heart sounds and the electrocardiogram was nor￾mal. The cyanosis persisted after her chest radio￾graph had returned to normal; physiological
studies and a lung scan performed at this time are
described below.
In January 1975 she had a fourth right-sided
hydrothorax, and one week later, when it had
largely been absorbed, she was investigated by
means of a diagnostic pneumoperitoneum. After
1 litre of air had been introduced into the peri￾toneal cavity she experienced a 'bubbling' sensa￾tion behind the sternum which persisted for 45
minutes. A chest radiograph two minutes after
peritoneal air injection showed no air above the
diaphragm, but another obtained after one hour
showed a large pneumothorax. These findings sug￾gested that a pleuroperitoneal communication was
responsible for the hydrothorax. In an attempt to
prevent its recurrence a pleurodesis was induced
by insufflating iodised talc into the right pleural
space. After this there was a remission for six
months, but in August 1975 she developed a fifth
large hydrothorax on the right side. Once again it
disappeared after thoracentesis and readjustment
of the diuretic therapy. Her condition gradually
deteriorated thereafter. Six further episodes of
right-sided hydrothorax occurred in the next nine
months, and moderate oedema, ascites, and en￾cephalopathy became intractable features. In May
1976 she was readmitted and died in hepatic coma.
Pulmonary function tests
METHODS
The forced expiratory volume in one second and
the forced vital capacity were measured using a
low resistance dry spirometer. Intrathoracic gas
volumes were determined by the helium dilution
method and the carbon monoxide transfer factor
(TF) by the single breath technique (Ogilvie et al.,
1957). Arterial 02 tension (Pao2), CO2 tension
(Paco2), and pH were measured with appropriate
electrodes (Radiometer E 5046, E 5036 and G
297). The 02 and CO2 electrodes were calibrated
using humidified gases of known composition and
the measured Pao2 was corrected for the 02 elec￾trode's blood-gas factor (106) which had been
determined by tonometry. Using standard tech￾niques and calculations, described in detail else￾where (Stanley and Woodgate, 1971), the alveolar￾arterial 02 tension difference (A-ADO2) was
measured while she breathed room air. The
A-ADO2 was also measured after 15 minutes
breathing 100% 02 and the true shunt was deter￾mined as a percentage fraction of the cardiac
output assuming an arteriovenous 02 content
difference of 29 vol %, which was the average
value in 12 other cases of cirrhosis with finger
clubbing (Stanley and Woodgate, 1971). Observed
values were compared with predicted normal
values for lung volumes and TF given by Cotes
(1975), and with gasometric data previously ob￾tained by the authors in healthy control subjects
using the same techniques.
RESULTS
Physiological data obtained in November 1974
when no pleural fluid was seen in the chest radio￾graph are listed in Table 1. The lung volumes
were normal, which excluded any major restric￾tive or obstructive ventilatory defects, but the TF
was very low. Arterial blood analysis showed severe
hypoxaemia in spite of a respiratory alkalosis. The

Volumes and transfer factor measured while seated and other values while supine.
A-ADO2 was considerably increased breathing room
air and also when breathing 02, indicating a true
shunt estimated to be 23% of the cardiac output.
The gasometric data were obtained in the supine
position. The Pao2 rose to 7 8 kPa (58 mm Hg)
when she lay on the left side but fell to 6-7 kPa
(50 mm Hg) when she turned on to her right side.
The Paco2 did not vary appreciably with body
position.
Repeated pulmonary function tests in the next
18 months continued to show normal ventilatory
capacity, but the TF remained very low (3 5-3 7
mmol min-'kPa) (10 6-11-2 ml min-1 mm Hg).
Interestingly, her hypoxaemia was not exacer￾bated during episodes of hydrothorax or when her
right lung was partially collapsed by the 1 litre
pneumothorax after the diagnostic pneumoperi￾toneum. With the pneumothorax in situ her Pao2
was 8-7 kPa (64 mm Hg) and fell to 7A4 kPa (55
mm Hg) after pleural aspiration had re-expanded
the right lung. Four hours before death the Pao2
was 6-9 kPa (51 mm Hg), Paco2 4-3 kPa (32 mm
Hg), and pH 7-33.
Perfusion scan
This was first done in November 1974 four days
after the lung function tests shown in Table 1.
No pleural fluid was seen on the chest radiograph,
even in the right lateral decubitus position. The
scan was obtained after the intravenous injection
of 4-2 mCi of 99m-technetium-labelled albumin
macroaggregates with diameters of 20-60 ,tm. To
minimise any effect on the pulmonary image of
occult pleural fluid, the particles were injected
in the seated position, whereas anterior and
posterior scans were obtained from the anterior
aspect while she lay supine. Using this procedure
even moderate-sized effusions cause only minor
defects at the lung base (Mishkin and Brashear,
1970). A scan of the whole trunk is shown in
Fig. 1. There had been less uptake of particles
throughout the right lung compared with the
left lung. Also some of the particles had passed
through the lungs into the systemic circulation,
causing high scintillation count rates over ab￾dominal organs. The appearances were consistent
with intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts pre￾dominantly within the right lung. A second scan
in April 1976 was very similar.
Postmortem findings
Two hours after death a coroner's postmortem
examination was performed. The liver and spleen
were moderately enlarged and there was a small
amount of ascites. No excess fluid was present in
the pleural cavities and there were few pleural
adhesions on either side in spite of the instillation
of talc the year before. The lungs and diaphragm
were removed for further studies, and blocks of
fresh tissue were cut from each lung for subse￾quent electron microscopy.
No gross pulmonary abnormalities were ob￾served, but their combined weight of 1040 g was
more than is usual for white females (745 g+4=91
SD) (Whimster and MacFarlane, 1974).
PREPARATION
The lungs were prepared for quantitative morpho￾metric analysis using previously described tech￾niques (Elliott and Reid, 1965; Davis and Reid,
1970). In brief, the pulmonary arterial tree was
injected with a micropaque-gelatin suspension at
65°C and at a pressure of 10 kPa (100 cm H20).
The injected material distends and fills all arteries
greater than 15 .tm in diameter but does not
cross the capillary bed; its passage into pulmonary

veins indicates the presence of arteriovenous ana￾stomoses. After vascular injection the lungs were
inflated through the trachea with 10% formol
saline at a pressure of 4 5 kPa (45 cm H20) until
the pleura was tense. After fixation the lungs were
radiographed and the preacinar arterial size was
assessed by measuring on the radiograph the inter￾nal diameter of the largest artery in the lower lobe
at 10 equal intervals along its axial pathway from
the hilum to the periphery. Eight blocks of tissue
were then taken from each lung using a stratified
random sampling technique (Dunnill, 1962), and
4 ,tm sections were cut and stained with Verhoff's
elastic van Gieson. After a general histological
assessment, a quantitative microscopic analysis of
the small vessels was performed. The average dia￾meters of arteries adjacent to respiratory bron￾chioles and alveolar ducts were calculated. As
another index of vessel size population counts
were done on arteries less than 300 ,um in diameter
(Hislop and Reid, 1972), whereby the relative in￾cidence of muscular, partially muscular, and non￾muscular vessels was determined in relation to
arterial diameter. The total numbers of filled

arteries and alveoli were also counted in a unit
area and expressed as a ratio of number of arteries
to number of alveoli. Control data were obtained
using the lungs of four individuals who had died
without liver or lung disease. For further study
of small intra-acinar vessels random samples were
taken from the injected lungs and embedded in
Araldite. Using an LKB III ultramicrotome and
glass knives, 1 ,um sections were cut, which were
stained with toluidine blue in 1% borax and
studied by light microscopy.
The lung tissue which had been obtained soon
after death for electron microscopy was fixed in
2 5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 2
hours, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehy￾drated, and embedded in Araldite. Pale gold sec￾tions were cut and stained with methanolic uranyl
acetate followed by lead citrate (Reynolds, 1963).
MACROSCOPIC AND RADIOGRAPHIC APPEARANCES
During vascular injection many abnormal pleural
vessels resembling cutaneous spider naevi were
filled with the micropaque gelatin, as shown in
Fig. 2. The naevi were more numerous over the
right than the left lung and provided a striking
contrast with the vessel-free appearance of the
pleural surface after vascular injection of normal
lungs. There was no reflux of injected material
from the pulmonary veins at the hilum, suggesting
that no major arteriovenous anastomoses were
present. Likewise no arteriovenous communica￾tions or filling of large veins were visible on the
radiographs; these also showed that the preacinar
arterial diameter was normal.
LIGHT MICROSCOPY
The lung architecture appeared normal and no
direct communications were seen between large
arteries and veins. Nonetheless injected material
was visible in some of the small veins, especially
in the right lung, which were identified by their
peripheral position in connective tissue of the
interlobular septa and by the absence of an ac￾companying airway (Fig. 3). The venous filling
demonstrated the existence of arteriovenous ana￾stomoses and was not observed in any of the
control lungs; its limitation to the small veins sug￾gested that the anastomoses were at precapillary
level. Another abnormality was dilatation of all
intra-acinar arteries, and this was more pronounced
in the right lung, as shown by the results in Table
2. Statistical comparisons showed that in each lung

the mean arterial diameters measured at respira￾tory bronchiolar or alveolar duct level were sig￾nificantly greater than in control lungs (P<0001).
The arterial diameters in the right lung were
significantly greater than in the left lung when
vessels were compared adjacent to respiratory
bronchioles (0001<P<001), but not when those
next to alveolar ducts were compared (0 3<P<
04). As further evidence of vasodilatation, there
was an increase in the proportion of non-muscular
and partially muscular arteries in the intra-acinar
arterial population when grouped by diameter
(Fig. 4); this increase was more pronounced in the
right lung. The number of arteries per alveolus
was within normal limits. Examination of the
toluidine blue sections (Fig. 5) revealed un￾expected abnormalities in the small veins and
capillaries. Unlike the arteries, the small veins did
not seem dilated; their luminal diameter actually
appeared diminished due to thickening of their
walls with a pale-staining, homogeneous, and
acellular material. Similar changes were observed
in capillaries, but the arterial walls seemed normal.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Ultrastructural examination demonstrated that the
increased thickness of the walls of small veins was
mainly due to a layer of collagen fibres and fine
filamentous material, as shown in Fig. 6. The
collagen was surrounded by an interrupted elastic
lamina, suggesting that it was located within the
intima. However, the possibility of its representing
medial degeneration could not be excluded since
there were occasional deposits of elastin and a
few degenerating smooth muscle cells both within
and internal to the collagen layer. The basement
membrane also appeared slightly thickened. Many
capillary walls were similarly thickened with col￾462 Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

minimum blood-gas distance was increased up to
096 (+0 11 SEM) ,m compared with 053
(+0-04) um in normal lung sections (P<0001).
Desquamation of epithelial cells was widespread,
and the blood-gas distance would have been greater
still if an intact epithelial layer had been included
in the patient's measurements. In addition, alveo￾lar oedema fluid was often seen as a film coating
the surface of the alveolar spaces, thereby further
increasing the blood-gas barrier.
Discussion
GAS EXCHANGE AND LUNG VASCULATURE
Summary of findings
The physiological studies showed that our patient's
hypoxaemia was due to impaired pulmonary gas
exchange with a large right-to-left shunt and a low
TF. Evidence of pulmonary arteriovenous shunts
was obtained in vivo by perfusion scanning; radio￾active particles were able to pass through the lungs
even though larger than normal capillary diameter.
The shunts seemed unevenly distributed because
fewer particles impacted in the right than in the
left lung. Pulmonary arterial injection at necropsy
demonstrated the existence of precapillary arterio￾venous anastomoses within the lungs and pleural
spider naevi. A morphometric analysis showed
dilatation of small pulmonary arteries. Large
arteries were normal in size. The vascular changes
were more marked in the right lung. The walls
of pulmonary capillaries and venules were
thickened by a layer of collagen.
Sites of shunting
Physiological evidence of right-to-left shunt in
liver cirrhosis was first presented by Wilson et al.
(1953), but its anatomical basis has been a subject
of controversy. Rydell and Hoffbauer (1956)
demonstrated multiple intrapulmonary arteriove￾nous anastomoses with diameters of up to 1000 1km
at necropsy in a boy with juvenile cirrhosis, which
were sufficient to explain his cyanosis before
death. Anastomoses were found between large
arteries and veins near the hilum as well as in the
peripheral vascular bed. Similar findings were re￾ported in two other cases where cirrhosis had
developed in early life (Hales, 1956; Kravath et al.,
1971). In contrast, several postmortem studies in
older patients failed to identify an obvious ana￾tomical pathway for shunting and suggested that
it might be occurring at an extrapulmonary site
(Rodman et al., 1959; Georg et al., 1960). With
hindsight, it now seems more likely in these in￾stances that the techniques had been inadequate
for demonstrating small anastomoses within the
acinus. Although channels linking the portal and
pulmonary venous systems (Calabresi and Abel￾mann, 1957) offer an alternative shunt pathway it
carries insufficient blood flow to cause more
than trivial changes in arterial 02 saturation
(Nakamura et al., 1965).
Intrapulmonary shunts
Further investigations in the past decade have re￾emphasised that abnormal intrapulmonary arterio￾venous communications are the most important
cause of shunting even in adult cases of cirrhosis.
Perfusion scans done in such patients have always
shown that the lungs fail to trap large pro￾portions of intravenously injected particles
(Stanley et al., 1972; Robin et al., 1975). However,
in cases with arteriovenous anastomoses demon￾strated postmortem using micropaque gelatin,
communications between pre-acinar vessels have
been visualised in only one patient, the child re￾G

ported by Kravath et al. (1971), and not in four
others including the present case (Berthelot et al.,
1966; Karlish et al., 1967; Silverman et al., 1968).
Therefore shunting is rarely attributable to
channels between large vessels remote from a gas
exchanging surface, except possibly in children;
more usually it reflects small precapillary anasto￾moses within the acinus. These may develop
through dilatation of some normal capillaries to
precapillary diameter or alternatively by the open￾ing of anatomic precapillary anastomoses, which
may exist in a non-functioning form in the normal
lung (Tobin, 1966; Niden and Aviado, 1956). All
intra-acinar vessels are capable of gas exchange
due to the proximity of alveolar gas (Staub, 1961),
but °2 uptake is thought to be very slow in pre￾capillaries (Sackner et al., 1964) and anastomoses
at this level are likely to behave as shunts even
in hyperoxia. Not all hypoxic cases have pre￾capillary anastomoses when studied at necropsy
(Berthelot et al., 1966), but arterial unsaturation in
liver cirrhosis may also be caused by ventilation￾perfusion inequality without shunting (Cotes et al.,
1968), perhaps on the basis of airway closure due
to peribronchial oedema (Ruff et al., 1971). It has
also been postulated that incomplete blood-gas
°2 equilibration (partial shunting) may occur at
capillary level, since the intra-acinar vascular dis￾order may cause extreme variation in diffusion￾perfusion ratios (Schomerus et al., 1975).
Regional variation in shunting
It was of additional interest that shunting appeared
to be greater in the right than in the left lung.
This conclusion was based on both lung scan
appearances and pathological findings but was also
consistent with physiological observations that the
Pao2 rose when she lay on the left side and during
partial collapse of the right lung after the diag￾nostic pneumoperitoneum. Presumably gravita￾tional effects in left lateral recumbency and the
presence of a right-sided pneumothorax improved
gas exchange by causing preferential perfusion of
the more efficient left lung. The possibility of
leaving a permanent pneumothorax as a thera￾peutic manoeuvre was considered but discarded

because, in spite of the increased arterial satura￾tion, the respiratory stimulus of lung deflation
made her more breathless. Uneven distribution of
intrapulmonary shunting has previously been
noted in a cyanosed patient with active chronic
hepatitis whose perfusion scan and pulmonary
angiogram suggested relative localisation of intra￾pulmonary shunts to the left lower lobe (Stanley
et al., 1972). Regional variation in the size and
density of arteriovenous anastomoses may also
explain the differences betwen lobes in the time
for injected material to cross the pulmonary
vascular bed in the case reported by Karlish et al.
(1967).
Pulmonary arterial dilatation
The morphometric analysis has provided the first
quantitative evidence that the pulmonary arterial
tree is dilated in liver cirrhosis, which had been
suggested by Berthelot et al. (1966). Similar data
have been obtained in cases of fulminant hepatic
failure (Williams et al., 1976). The increased
calibre of small peripheral rather than large
central arteries contrasts with the picture in left￾to-right shunting due to congenital heart defects,
where large arteries dilate more than the small
ones (Hislop et al., 1975). This supports the belief
that a circulating vasoactive substance is primarily
responsible for the pulmonary arterial changes in
liver disease rather than passive distension to ac￾commodate an increased blood flow. Pleural spider
naevi and precapillary anastomoses within the lung
are presumably other manifestations of the pul￾monary vasodilatation. Possible vasoactive sub￾stances responsible for the circulatory changes in
liver failure include reduced ferritin (Shorr et al.,
1951), histamine (Martini et al., 1970), vasoactive
intestinal peptide (Said and Mutt, 1970), brady￾kinin, and prostaglandins (Seymour et al., 1976).
Identifying the most important among these might
assist in therapy if an appropriate pharmacological
blocker could be given. Regarding the effect of
histamine, trials of histamine H1- and H2-receptor
antagonists did not cause significant changes in
our patient's Pao2.
Vascular basis of reduced TF
A reduction in TF is a consistent finding in
hypoxic cases of liver cirrhosis (Cotes et al., 1968;
Stanley and Woodgate, 1972). It occurs in all
types of chronic liver disease and not just in cases
with a history of alcoholism or smoking, which
may be independent causes of a reduced TF
(Emirgil et al., 1974; Van Ganse et al., 1972). Its
aetiology has previously been obscure but, in our
patient, might be explained by the thickening of
the blood-gas barrier, which must have slowed
the rate of carbon monoxide diffusion across the
alveolar-capillary membrane. We have since dis￾covered mural thickening of capillaries and small
veins, associated with arterial dilatation, in two
other patients who died of primary and secondary
biliary cirrhosis respectively, but not in 12 cases
of fulminant hepatic failure reported elsewhere
(Williams et al., 1976). Possibly the thickening was
a consequence of long-standing transmission of
abnormally high pressures to capillaries and veins
due to arterial dilatation, analogous to the pro￾gressive arterialisation of vessels distal to peri￾pheral arteriovenous fistulae (Petrovsky and
Milonov, 1967). Focal intimal thickening of ve￾nous walls was also noted in two cases with small
pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae described by
Hales (1956), including one without liver disease.
Alternatively, the venous and capillary changes
may represent a response to some unidentified
toxin or product of inflammation. Further studies
will be necessary to assess their nature and
physiological significance.
HEPATIC HYDROTHORAX
Characteristics and aetiology
In a study of 200 consecutive cases of cirrhosis,
pleural effusions were found in 6% (Johnston and
Loo, 1964). Although sometimes small and bi￾lateral, the effusions are frequently massive and
unilateral with the right side involved more
frequently than the left. Frothingham (1942) re￾ported a patient with massive recurrent effusions
who needed 211 thoracenteses with the removal of
467 litres of fluid for the relief of dyspnoea. The
fluid has the characteristics of a transudate. Vari￾ous factors may contribute to the formation of
hepatic hydrothoraces. Small effusions may be
the result of excessive pleural transudation due to
hypoalbuminaemia (Higgins et al., 1947), hyper￾tension in the azygos vein (Morrow et al., 1958),
increased pressure in a thoracic duct overloaded
by drainage of ascites (Dumont and Mulholland,
1960), and passage of ascites through diaphragm
lymphatics (Johnston and Loo, 1964). However,
the sudden accumulation of a large, unilateral
effusion is now thought to be caused by direct
movement of ascites under pressure across small
defects in the diaphragm. Openings in the dia￾phragm can usually be demonstrated by means of
a diagnostic pneumoperitoneum (Williams, 1950;
Lieberman et al., 1966) and have been observed
at necropsy in several cases (Emerson and Davies,
1955; Lieberman and Peters, 1970). The defects
are probably created by the rupture of congenital

sites of weakness. Although no openings were
found post mortem in our patient's diaphragm,
there were many weak areas within the central
tendon which might have ruptured under moderate
stress (Fig. 8).
Therapy
The formation of a hepatic hydrothorax decom￾presses the abdomen, which may allow a dia￾phragmatic opening to heal (Lieberman and
Peters, 1970). Therefore thoracentesis should be
reserved for diagnosis and relief of dyspnoea. since
it may re-establish a large transdiaphragmatic pres￾sure gradient and prevent healing. The principal
aim of therapy should be the elimination of
ascites because this is the source of the hydro￾thorax. Often conventional medical treatment is
sufficient, but sometimes large hydrothoraces may
be a recurrent problem in spite of the intensive
use of diuretics. Unfortunately, the potential value
of chemical pleurodesis in such instances cannot
be judged from the results in the present case,
since failure to produce a long-lasting remission
could be explained by an inadequate pleural
reaction to the sclerosing agent.
