Excessive consumption of diets high in sugars and saturated fat, frequently known
as western diet (WD), may lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent evidence
shows that WD-induced obesity impairs cardiac function, but the underlying mechanisms
are not fully understood. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-dependent
metabolite of specific dietary nutrients, has emerged as a key contributor to
cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that elevated circulating
TMAO levels contribute to cardiac dysfunction in WD-induced obesity. CD1 mice were
fed a normal diet (ND) or a WD, without or with 1.0% 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB, an
inhibitor of trimethylamine formation) in drinking water for 8 weeks. Compared with mice
fed a ND, mice fed a WD showed a significant increase in body weight and dyslipidemia,
and had markedly higher plasma TMAO levels at the end of the feeding protocol.
Echocardiography revealed that cardiac systolic and diastolic function was impaired in
mice fed a WD. DMB treatment had no effects on body weight and dyslipidemia, but
significantly reduced plasma TMAO levels and prevented cardiac dysfunction in mice fed
a WD. In addition, mice fed a WD had elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin IL-1β, decreased expression of anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10, and increased interstitial fibrosis in the hearts, all of which were prevented
by DMB treatment. Notably, DMB treatment also reduced plasma TMAO levels in mice
fed a ND but did not alter other parameters. These results suggest that consumption of
a WD increases circulating TMAO levels, which lead to cardiac inflammation and fibrosis,
contributing to cardiac dysfunction. Interventions that reduce circulating TMAO levels
may be a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of WD-induced cardiac
dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of obesity is now recognized worldwide as a
major health problem and has reached epidemic proportions,
affecting both genders and all ages (Flegal et al., 2012; Head,
2015). Large epidemiological studies have conclusively showed
that obesity is associated with increased mortality mostly caused
by augmented risk of cardiovascular disease (Prospective Studies
et al., 2009). Obesity is a major risk factor for heart failure
(Kenchaiah et al., 2002; Baena-Díez et al., 2010). Several cohort
studies of heart failure patients have revealed that nearly 35% of
those patients are obese and that 60% are overweight (Gustafsson
et al., 2005). Although it is clear that genetic factors and
sedentary lifestyles play pivotal roles in the rising prevalence
of obesity, dietary factors, particularly the consumption of
foods rich in sugars and saturated fat, frequently known as
western diet (WD), is thought to be a major risk factor for
development of obesity (Sahoo et al., 2015). Experimental
studies have recently shown that WD-induced obesity in mice
impairs cardiac function (Carbone et al., 2015; Kesherwani
et al., 2015), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood.
Emerging evidence reveals that the gut microbiota is
implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease
(Tang and Hazen, 2014). Animal and human studies have
demonstrated a meta-organismal pathway in which the gut
microbiota plays an obligatory role in the metabolism of
trimethylamine (TMA) containing nutrients, such as L-carnitine,
choline, and betaine (Wang et al., 2011; Wang Z. et al., 2014;
Boutagy et al., 2015a). The metabolism of these constituents
produces TMA, which is readily absorbed and travels via the
portal circulation to the liver, where it is oxidized by hepatic
flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) to trimethylamine-N-oxide
(TMAO; Wang et al., 2011; Wang Z. et al., 2014; Boutagy
et al., 2015a). Elevated TMAO levels has recently been shown
to be independently associated with increased risk of adverse
cardiovascular outcomes, including heart attack, stroke, and
death risk (Tang and Hazen, 2014, 2017; Tang et al., 2015b; Kitai
et al., 2016; Senthong et al., 2016). Moreover, elevated TMAO
levels in mice exacerbate pressure overload-induced heart failure
(Organ et al., 2016) and promote vascular inflammation (Seldin
et al., 2016). Consumption of WD has been demonstrated to
cause alterations in gut microbiota composition, with decreased
levels of Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria and increased levels
of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (Turnbaugh et al., 2008;
Hildebrandt et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2015). Altered microbiota
composition may influence gut microbial TMA production
and TMAO synthesis (Chen et al., 2016). Indeed, recent
studies have demonstrated that consumption of WD lead to
increases in circulating TMAO levels in human (Boutagy et al.,
2015a,b). To date, however, no studies have tested whether
TMAO plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction
in obesity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
elevated TMAO on the development of cardiac dysfunction
in WD-induced obese mice that mimic human obesity
syndrome.
METHODS
Animals
Eight-week-old male CD1 mice were purchased from Vital River
(A Charles River Company, Beijing, China). All animals were
housed under 12-h light–12-h dark conditions with food and
water available ad libitum. All experimental procedures and
protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Jining Medical University,
and were performed in accordance with the “Guiding Principles
for Research Involving Animals and Human Beings.”
Protocol
To examine the role of TMAO in cardiac dysfunction in WD￾induced obesity, forty mice were fed a normal diet (ND, control)
or a WD, simultaneously without or with 1.0% 3,3-Dimethyl￾1-butanol (DMB, an inhibitor of TMA formation) in drinking
water for 8 weeks (n = 10 for each group). This dose of DMB
has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit TMA formation and
reduce plasma TMAO levels in mice (Wang et al., 2015). The
WD (TD 88137, Harlan) contained 42% total fat, 12.8% saturated
fat, and 30% sucrose, while ND (Teklad LM-385, Harlan) had
17% total fat, 0.8% saturated fat, and 0% sucrose (Carbone et al.,
2015). This WD has been shown to induce cardiac systolic and
diastolic dysfunction in mice after 8 week feeding (Carbone et al.,
2015). Food intake was measured daily and body weight was
measured weekly. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were
measured using a tail-cuff plethysmography (BP-98A; Softron
Co, Tokyo, Japan) at baseline and 8 weeks after WD feeding.
Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography at baseline
and 8 weeks after WD feeding. At the end of the study protocol,
mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Blood samples were
collected for biochemical analysis. Hearts were rapidly removed
and weighed, and the part of the heart was fixed in 10% formalin
for analysis of cardiac fibrosis. The remainder of the heart was
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80◦C for molecular
studies.
Echocardiography
Cardiac function was assessed using a 15 MHz linear-array
transducer, coupled to a Sonos 5500R ultrasonograph (Philips
Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA), as previously described
(Carbone et al., 2015; Soliman et al., 2015). Briefly, mice were
lightly sedated with 5% isoflurane and placed in the supine
position. M-mode and two-dimensional parasternal short- and
long-axis scans were obtained to assess changes in left ventricular
(LV) dimensions, mass, ejection fraction (EF), and cardiac
output (CO). An apical four-chamber view of the left ventricle
was acquired, and a pulsed-wave Doppler system was applied
to determine the isovolumetric contraction time (ICT) and
relaxation time (IRT), the ejection time, and the myocardial
performance index (MPI).
Masson Trichrome Staining
To assess cardiac fibrosis, Masson Trichrome staining was
performed using a Masson Trichrom stain kit (Thermo Scientific,
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 139

Chen et al. TMAO and Cardiac Dysfunction
Rockford, IL, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, heart tissues from different groups were sectioned
(18 µm) and mounted on glass slides. The sections were
placed in Bouin’s fluid at 56◦C for 1 h and then stained by
Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin for 10 min. After rinsing briefly
in deionized water, sections were placed in phosphotungstic￾phosphomolybdic acid solution for 15 min followed by aniline
blue staining for 30 min. Sections were then placed in 1%
acetic acid solution for 1 min, rinsed, dehydrated, mounted,
and imaged under microscope. Cardiac fibrosis was calculated
based upon percentages of collagen positive areas in the total
myocardial area, as described previously (Wang Y. et al.,
2014).
Biochemical Analysis
Plasma TMAO levels were measured using liquid
chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole mass
spectrometry as described previously (Ufnal et al., 2014).
Plasma glucose levels were measured with a glucose analyzer
(Prestige Smart System). Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides
levels were measured using commercially available kits (Pointe
Scientific, Canton, MI, USA).
Western Blot Analysis
Protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β and anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 in the heart were analyzed by western blot
as previously described (Kesherwani et al., 2015). Briefly,
the heart tissue was homogenized in a mammalian tissue
lysis buffer with protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA). The protein concentration was quantified by
a Bradford assay. Samples were separated on 12% SDS￾polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA).
After blocking for 1 h in 5% non-fat dry milk, the membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies to TNF-α, IL-1β
(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), IL-10 (EMD
Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) and β-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4◦C
overnight. Membranes were then washed and incubated at
room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
second antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized
using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) and band densities
were analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). All data were normalized by
β-actin.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Two-way ANOVA
was used to analyze data and differences were analyzed using
a multiple-comparison test (Tukey’s method). The results are
expressed as mean ± SE. Differences were considered significant
if P < 0.05.
RESULTS
Effects of WD and DMB on Body Weight
and Metabolic Disorders
Before WD feeding (baseline), body weight was similar among
the four groups (Figure 1A). It was unlikely that there were
significant differences in the levels of metabolic parameters
before WD feeding, so we did not measure the baseline levels of
metabolic parameters.
After WD feeding, mice fed a WD gained significantly
more body weight than mice fed a ND after 6 weeks of WD
feeding and this trend continued throughout the dietary protocol
(Figure 1A). Daily food intake was significantly less (4.3 ± 0.2 vs.
5.5 ± 0.3 g/day, P < 0.05) but daily caloric intake was significantly
higher (19.8 ± 1.2 vs. 15.1 ± 0.9 kal/day, P < 0.05) in mice
fed a WD compared with mice fed a ND. At the end of the
feeding protocol, the levels of plasma triglyceride and cholesterol
were increased in mice fed a WD as compared to mice fed a
ND (Figures 1B,C). These data indicate that mice fed a WD
for 8 weeks develop obesity and dyslipidemia. An 8 week DMB
treatment, beginning at the start of WD feeding, did not alter
any of these parameters in mice fed either a WD or a ND. There
were no differences in plasma glucose levels across all four groups
(Figure 1D).
Effects of WD and DMB on Plasma TMAO
Levels
As shown in Figure 2, mice fed a WD for 8 weeks exhibited
markedly increased plasma TMAO levels as compared to mice
fed a ND. DMB treatment significantly reduced plasma TMAO
levels not only in mice fed a WD but also in mice fed a ND.
Effects of WD and DMB on Cardiac
Function
Echocardiography showed that there were no differences in
LV mass, cardiac systolic and diastolic function across four
groups before WD feeding (Figure 3). At the end of the feeding
protocol, LV mass was slightly increased in mice fed a WD
compared with mice fed a ND, but the difference did not
reach statistical significance (Figure 3A). DMB treatment had
no effect on LV mass in both groups. Compared with mice
fed a ND, mice fed a WD exhibited significantly decrease in
LVEF by ∼19% (Figure 3B) and increases in LVICT (Figure 3D),
LVIRT (Figure 3E) and MPI (Figure 3F) by ∼39, 20, and 35%,
respectively. DMB treatment prevented WD-induced changes
in LVEF, LVICT, LVIRT, and MPI in mice fed a WD but did
not alter these parameters in mice fed a ND. No difference
in cardiac output (Figure 3C) was observed among the four
groups.
Effects of WD and DMB on Cardiac Fibrosis
Increased fibrosis in extracellular tissues has been shown to
impair cardiac systolic and diastolic function in animal model
of WD-induced obesity (Carbone et al., 2015; Kesherwani
et al., 2015). To determine whether elevated TMAO levels
contribute to increased cardiac fibrosis in WD-induced obese
mice, we performed Masson Trichrome staining to assess

cardiac fibrosis at 8 weeks after WD feeding and DMB
treatment. We observed significant increase in interstitial
fibrosis in mice fed a WD when compared with mice fed a
ND (Figure 4). Of note, WD-induced increase in interstitial
fibrosis in mice was prevented by treatment with DMB,
which had no effect on interstitial fibrosis in mice fed a
ND.
Effects of WD and DMB on Expression of
Inflammatory Cytokines in the Hearts
To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which
elevated TMAO levels induce cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis
in WD-induced obesity, we measured the expression of
inflammatory cytokines in the hearts, which has been
demonstrated to be associated with cardiac fibrosis and
dysfunction (Sun et al., 2007; Carbone et al., 2015; Kesherwani
et al., 2015). As illustrated in Figure 5, an 8 week WD
feeding significantly increased protein levels of TNF-α and
IL-1β, two key pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute
to cardiac fibrosis, but decreased protein levels of IL￾10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in the
protection against WD or lipopolysaccharides-induced
inflammation (Grant et al., 2014). DMB treatment reversed
WD-induced changes in protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and
IL-10 in the hearts of mice fed a WD, whereas it did not
alter protein levels of these inflammatory cytokines in mice
fed a ND.

DISCUSSION
The major findings of this study are as follows: (1) compared
with mice fed a ND, mice fed a WD for 8 weeks develop obesity
and dyslipidemia, and have higher plasma TMAO levels; (2)
treatment with DMB, an inhibitor of TMA formation, prevents
WD-induced increases in plasma TMAO levels without effects
on body weight and dyslipidemia; (3) mice fed a WD for 8 weeks
exhibit cardiac dysfunction, which is prevented by treatment
with DMB; (4) mice fed a WD for 8 weeks have interstitial
fibrosis and inflammation in the heart, which are prevented by
treatment with DMB. Taken together, these data suggest that WD
feeding increases plasma TMAO levels, which leads to elevated
inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the heart, contributing to
cardiac dysfunction.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
the world and a known environmental risk factor for the
development of cardiovascular disease is WD, a diet rich in
sugars and saturated fat (Bäckhed et al., 2004; Foote et al., 2016).
Although historically a causal role for WD-induced metabolic
disorders has been the primary focus, more recent studies
have revealed additional contributory role of dietary-associated
and gut microbiota-dependent metabolite TMAO (Brown and
Hazen, 2015). TMA containing nutrients including L-carnitine
and choline are primarily present in WD. Excessive consumption
of WD may influence the capacity of the gut microbiota to
generate TMA and, consequently TMAO from these nutrients
(Boutagy et al., 2015b). Additionally, consumption of WD
can rapidly alter the composition of gut microbiota (David
et al., 2014), leading to increased production of TMAO (Kitai
et al., 2016). In the present study, we found that mice fed a
WD for 8 weeks developed obesity and dyslipidemia but did
not significantly increase plasma glucose levels, confirming the
results of a previous study (Carbone et al., 2015). Moreover, an
8 week WD feeding significantly increased plasma TMAO levels
in mice, which is consistent with the finding of recent studies
in human (Boutagy et al., 2015a,b), suggesting that consumption
of WD may alter gut microbiota composition and function, and
contribute to elevated circulating TMAO levels.
Several studies have shown a strong link between elevated
TMAO and cardiovascular disease. For example, examination
of sequential subjects (n = 1020) undergoing cardiac diagnostic
catheterization shows markedly elevated circulating TMAO
levels in patients with coronary artery disease (Wang et al., 2011).
In a distinct cohort of subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization
(n = 4007), elevated circulating TMAO levels were shown
to independently predict major adverse cardiac events over a
3-year period (Tang et al., 2013). Circulating TMAO levels
were also increased in patients with heart failure and these

higher circulating TMAO levels were associated with increased
5-year mortality risk (Tang et al., 2014). Moreover, a recent
experimental study showed that dietary TMAO directly promotes
the development and progression of cardiac dysfunction and
heart failure (Organ et al., 2016). Our data showed that mice
fed a WD for 8 weeks exhibited cardiac systolic and diastolic
dysfunction as evidenced by decrease in LVEF and increases
in LVICT, LVIRT and MPI, compared with mice fed a ND.
These data confirm previous findings that a WD feeding induces
impairment of cardiac function in mice (Carbone et al., 2015;
Kesherwani et al., 2015). More importantly, we found that
cardiac dysfunction observed in mice fed a WD was prevented
by treatment with DMB (an inhibitor of TMA formation),
which inhibited WD-induced increases in plasma TMAO levels.
Notably, DMB treatment did not alter blood pressure and
metabolic disorders in mice fed a WD, thus excluding the
possibility that benefic effect of DMB on cardiac dysfunction is
due to improvements in blood pressure and metabolic disorders.
Collectively, these findings clearly demonstrate that WD-induces
increases in circulating TMAO levels independently contribute to
cardiac dysfunction in WD-induced obesity.
Increased cardiac fibrosis has been suggested to account for
cardiac dysfunction in mice fed a WD (Carbone et al., 2015;
Kesherwani et al., 2015). Increased cardiac fibrosis may lead to LV
stiffening, loss of compliance and further impairments in cardiac
contraction and relaxation (Organ et al., 2016). Consistent with
previous findings, we found that cardiac fibrosis was significantly
increased in mice fed a WD for 8 weeks, as indicated by Masson
Trichrome staining. The increased cardiac fibrosis observed in
mice fed a WD was prevented by treatment with DMB, suggesting
that increased circulating TMAO levels play a contributory role
in mediating WD-induced cardiac fibrosis. Indeed, a previous
study has shown that dietary TMAO induces increased fibrosis
in an alternative end organ, the kidney (Tang et al., 2015a). In
addition, dietary TMAO enhanced renal fibrosis in a manner
dose dependently associated with circulating TMAO levels (Tang
et al., 2015a). Increased fibrosis was also observed in the hearts
of heart failure mice fed a diet supplemented with TMAO and
was consistent with enhanced indices of cardiac dysfunction and
adverse prognosis (Organ et al., 2016).
Increased cardiac inflammation due to upregulation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of anti￾inflammatory cytokines has been suggested to contribute
to cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction in WD-induced obesity
and diabetes mellitus (Sun et al., 2007; Carbone et al., 2015;
Kesherwani et al., 2015). To further investigate the molecular
mechanism responsible for TMAO-induced cardiac fibrosis and
dysfunction in WD-induced obesity, we measured the protein
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hearts. We observed
significant increases in protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β and
decreases in protein levels of IL-10 in the hearts of mice fed
a WD for 8 weeks, which are in agreement with a previous
report (Kesherwani et al., 2015). Moreover, we found that DMB
treatment prevented WD-induced changes in protein levels
for above inflammatory cytokines. These findings indicate that
elevated circulating TMAO levels in mice fed a WD induce
cardiac inflammation probably by shifting the cytokine profile
from anti- to pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to cardiac
fibrosis and dysfunction.
One limitation of this study should be acknowledged. Gut
microbiota analysis was not performed in the present study,
we did not know how WD influenced the gut microbiota
composition in our animal model. Further studies are needed to
address this issue by analyzing gut microbiota.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
consumption of a WD increases gut microbiota-dependent
metabolite TMAO levels in the circulation, which lead to cardiac
inflammation and fibrosis, contributing to cardiac dysfunction
in mice. The findings from this study provide new insights into
the mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction in WD-induced
obesity. Interventions that reduce circulating TMAO levels may
be a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of
WD-induced cardiac dysfunction.
