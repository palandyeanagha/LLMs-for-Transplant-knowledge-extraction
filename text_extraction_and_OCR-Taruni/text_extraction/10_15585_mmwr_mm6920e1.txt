On May 18, 2020, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national 
state of emergency to control the pandemic spread of 
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) (1). Public health response measures to mitigate 
the pandemic have centered on social distancing and quarantine 
policies, including shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. 
Michigan implemented a stay-at-home order on March 23, 
2020, to facilitate social distancing (2). Such strategies might 
result in decreased accessibility to routine immunization ser￾vices, leaving children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases 
and their complications (3). To evaluate whether vaccination 
coverage has changed during the pandemic, data from the 
Michigan Care Improvement Registry (the state’s immuniza￾tion information system) (MCIR) were analyzed. Changes in 
vaccine doses administered to children and the effects of those 
changes on up-to-date status were examined for vaccinations 
recommended at milestone ages corresponding to the end of 
an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommendation period for one or more vaccines (4).
The vaccination status of milestone age cohorts of children 
at ages 1, 3, 5, 7, 16, 19, and 24 months was assessed, with 
each cohort including an average sample size of 9,269 for the 
study period years 2016–2019, and 9,539 for 2020. Up-to-date 
status for individual vaccines and the recommended age-based 
vaccine series* were assessed at a point in time in May 2020 and 
compared with 1-month age cohort assessments for points in 
time in May 2016–May 2019. The number of noninfluenza 
vaccine doses administered and reported to MCIR for children 
aged ≤18 years and aged ≤24 months also were examined dur￾ing January–April 2020, compared with averages for the same 
period in 2018 and 2019.
*Milestone age-based cohort assessments of recommended vaccine doses received 
were as follows: 1 month — 1st dose hepatitis B (HepB) within 3 days of life; 
3 months — 2nd dose HepB, 1 rotavirus (Rota), 1 diphtheria, tetanus, and 
acellular pertussis (DTaP), 1 Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), 
1 pneumococcal conjugate (PCV), 1 inactivated poliovirus (IPV); 5 months — 
2 HepB, 2 Rota, 2 DTaP, 2 Hib, 2 PCV, 2 IPV; 7 months — 2 HepB, up-to-date 
(UTD) Rota, 3 DTaP, UTD Hib, 3 PCV, 2 IPV; 16 months — 2 HepB, 3 DTaP, 
UTD Hib, 4 PCV, 2 IPV, 1 measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), 1 varicella (Var); 
19 months — 3 HepB, 4 DTaP, UTD Hib, 4 PCV, 3 IPV, 1 MMR, 1 Var; 
24 months — 3 HepB, 4 DTaP, UTD Hib, 4 PCV, 3 IPV, 1 MMR, 1 Var, 
2 hepatitis A.
Vaccination coverage declined in all milestone age cohorts, 
except for birth-dose hepatitis B coverage, which is typically 
administered in the hospital setting (Figure). Among children 
aged 5 months, up-to-date status for all recommended vaccines 
declined from approximately two thirds of children during 
2016–2019 (66.6%, 67.4%, 67.3%, 67.9%, respectively) to 
fewer than half (49.7%) in May 2020. For the 16-month age 
cohort, coverage with all recommended vaccines declined, 
with measles-containing vaccination coverage decreasing from 
76.1% in May 2019 to 70.9% in May 2020. In addition to a 
decline in up-to-date status in almost all age cohorts, the num￾ber of noninfluenza vaccine doses administered and reported 
for children aged ≤18 years decreased 21.5%, and the number 
of doses administered to children aged ≤24 months decreased 
15.5% during January–April 2020, compared with the same 
averaged periods in 2018 and 2019.
Up-to-date series coverage for each age cohort (1, 3, 5, 7, 
16, 19, and 24 months) assessed in May 2020 was lower for 
Medicaid-enrolled children than for those children not enrolled 
in Medicaid. The largest difference was in the age 7 months 
cohort assessed in May 2020; in that cohort, 34.6% of Medicaid￾enrolled children were up-to-date for their recommended series, 
compared with 55.0% of children not enrolled in Medicaid.
As the nation continues efforts to mitigate transmission of 
SARS-CoV-2, disruption of essential health services might 
occur, including in outpatient settings. Many provider offices 
have transitioned to telemedicine practices, where possible, to 
provide continuity of care in the medical home (5). Although 
some components of a well-child visit can be completed 
through telemedicine video conferences, immunization services 
require an in-person visit. Strategies to maintain immuniza￾tion services include dedicating specific clinics, rooms, or 
buildings for sick visits and well visits; reducing the number 
of patients on-site at any one time; closing waiting rooms or 
registration areas, and having patients check in by phone and 
receive vaccinations from their vehicles in the parking lot (6). 
Providers can use their patients’ electronic health records and 
immunization information systems to work with families 
to schedule in-person appointments, identify children who 
have missed recommended vaccinations, and assure par￾ents that strict infection control practices are in place. The 
observed declines in vaccination coverage might leave young 
children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable

diseases such as measles. If measles vaccination coverage of 
90%–95% (the level needed to establish herd immunity) is 
not achieved, measles outbreaks can occur. Concerted efforts 
are needed to ensure rapid catch-up for children who are not 
up-to-date with measles-containing vaccines as well as other 
ACIP-recommended vaccinations (4). Michigan continues to 
work with local health departments and vaccine providers to 
regularly assess patient populations for vaccination coverage, 
promote tools to conduct reminders and recalls, and develop 
provider and parent education regarding the continued need 
for vaccination during pandemics.
