 B-Vitamin dependent methionine metabolism and 
alcoholic liver disease 
 Abstract
 Convincing evidence links aberrant B-vitamin dependent 
hepatic methionine metabolism to the pathogenesis of 
alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This review focuses on the 
essential roles of folate and vitamins B6 and B12 in hepatic 
methionine metabolism, the causes of their deficiencies 
among chronic alcoholic persons, and how their defi￾ciencies together with chronic alcohol exposure impact 
on aberrant methionine metabolism in the pathogenesis 
of ALD. Folate is the dietary transmethylation donor for 
the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is 
the substrate for all methyltransferases that regulate gene 
expressions in pathways of liver injury, as well as a regu￾lator of the transsulfuration pathway that is essential for 
production of glutathione (GSH), the principal antioxi￾dant for defense against oxidative liver injury. Vitamin B12 
regulates transmethylation reactions for SAM production 
and vitamin B6 regulates transsulfuration reactions for 
GSH production. Folate deficiency accelerates the experi￾mental development of ALD in ethanol-fed animals while 
reducing liver SAM levels with resultant abnormal gene 
expression and decreased production of antioxidant GSH. 
Through its effects on folate metabolism, reduced SAM 
also impairs nucleotide balance with resultant increased 
DNA strand breaks, oxidation, hepatocellular apoptosis, 
and risk of carcinogenesis. The review encompasses refer￾enced studies on mechanisms for perturbations of methio￾nine metabolism in ALD, evidence for altered gene expres￾sions and their epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis 
of ALD, and clinical studies on potential prevention and 
treatment of ALD by correction of methionine metabolism 
with SAM.

 Introduction 
 Chronic alcoholism accounts for nearly 5 % of all deaths 
worldwide, mainly as a consequence of alcoholic liver 
disease (ALD) that occurs in about 30 % of active alcohol 
consumers [1] . Although ALD was originally considered 
to be a nutritional disorder resulting from poor diet in 
chronic alcohol addicts, experiments that originated over 
40 years ago [2] have established that alcohol is a specific 
toxin to the liver which triggers an inflammatory response 
through a complex pattern of molecular signaling that 
results in lipid accumulation, inflammation, cell death, 
and collagen deposition leading to diffuse scarring of the 
liver known as cirrhosis [3] . Recent extensive and ongoing 
work has established that alcohol has profound effects on 
the metabolism of methionine in the liver that ultimately 
regulate antioxidant defense and the expressions of genes 
related to liver injury [4, 5] . Furthermore, the methionine 
metabolic cycle is tightly regulated by the supply of three 
essential B-vitamins. These include folate which is the 
original methyl donor for the production of S-adenosyl￾methionine (SAM), the substrate for all DNA and histone 
methyltransferases including those involved in activation 
of liver injury genes; vitamin B12 or cobalamin which is 
the co-factor for methionine synthase (MS); and vitamin 
B6 or pyridoxine, which is the cofactor for cystathionine￾β -synthase (C β S) and cystathionase, which are the initial 
transsulfuration reactions in the production of the anti￾oxidant glutathione (GSH) (Figure 1 ). 
 Methionine cycle and effects 
of ethanol 
 Relevant pathways of folate metabolism and the trans￾methylation and transsulfuration pathways of methio￾nine metabolism are detailed in Figure 1. As shown, the 
original methyl donor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) 
is derived both from dietary folate and endogenously 
from tetrahydrofolate (THF) by way of 5,10-methylene 

458  Halsted: B-Vitamin dependent methionine metabolism and ALD
tetrahydrofolate (5,10 MTHF) and methylene tetrahydro￾folate reductase (MTHFR). In addition to its role as sub￾strate for MTHFR, 5,10-MTHF is substrate for thymidylate 
synthase (TS) which maintains DNA nucleotide balance 
by regulating the levels of deoxyuridine monophosphate 
(dUMP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). 
DNA nucleotide imbalance is secondary to decreased 
availability of 5,10-MTHF and is associated with apopto￾sis, or hepatocyte death secondary to DNA strand breaks 
and oxidation, as was observed in ethanol-fed micro￾pigs and rats [6 – 8] . The level of 5,10-MTHF is controlled 
in part by SAM which provides negative regulation of 
MTHFR activity. Hence, when SAM is low, as may occur 
with folate deficiency in chronic alcoholism, MTHFR 
activity is augmented, thereby reducing 5,10-MTHF and 
increasing the risk of nucleotide imbalance, apoptosis, 
and carcinogenesis [6–8] . 
 Folate in the form of 5-MTHF is the original 
methyl donor through its subsequent entry into the 
transmethylation reaction as substrate with homocys￾teine for the vitamin B12-dependent reaction MS in the 
production of methionine and subsequently SAM. When 
MS expression and activity are inhibited by alcohol expo￾sure, betaine becomes an alternate substrate for betaine 
homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) that converts 
homocysteine to methionine and produces dimethylgly￾cine (DMG) [9] . Recent work in ethanol-fed rats showed 
that the co-administration of betaine specifically pre￾vented the development of oxidative injury processes 
through reduction in homocysteine and preservation of 
normal SAM levels [10] . Methionine, the product of either 
MS or BHMT, is the substrate for hepatic methionine 
adenosyl transferase (MAT) which exists in gene form 
predominantly as MAT1A in progressive alcoholic liver 
injury and as MAT2A after malignant transformation [8] . 
Whereas MAT1A knockout mice develop progressive liver 
injury [11] , similar findings occur in animal models where 
the expression of MAT1A is reduced in part due to the 
Figure 1   Folate and methionine metabolism in the liver. 
 Folate metabolism includes DHF (dihydrofolate), THF (tetrahydrofolate); 5,10-MTHF, 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR (methylene 
tetrahydrofolate reductase) and 5-MTHF (5-methyltetrahydrofolate), which is the original methyl donor for transmethylation reactions. DNA 
synthesis and stability is regulated by TS (thymidylate synthase) and the balance of its substrate dUMP (deoxyuridine monophosphate) and 
product dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate). In transmethylation reactions, 5-MTHF and homocysteine are substrates for vitamin B12 
dependent MS (methionine synthase) in production of methionine, which is metabolized to SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) by MAT (methio￾nine adenosyl transferase). Methionine also can be produced from betaine and homocysteine by BHMT (betaine homocysteine methyl 
transferase) with additional product DMG (di-methylglycine). SAM is the methyl donor for all MTs (methyltransferase reactions), producing 
methylated DNA and histones as well as other methylated compounds. SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine) is both product and inhibitor of 
MT reactions, and substrate for the bidirectional enzyme SAHH (SAH hydrolase) which produces homocysteine when SAH is in excess or 
SAH when homocysteine is in excess. In transsulfuration reactions, homocysteine is metabolized by vitamin B6 dependent and SAM up￾regulated C β S (cystathionine beta synthase) and cystathionase to produce cysteine and the antioxidant GSH (glutathione). Note also that 
SAM down-regulates MTHFR and up-regulates C β S. Hence SAM deficiency increases production of 5-MTHF while reducing 5,10-MTHF, but 
reduces production of GSH.

effects of nitrosylation of one of the cysteine residues in 
the translated form of the enzyme [12] . 
 SAM, the product of MAT, is the major methyl donor 
for all methyltransferase (MT) reactions, including those 
for DNA and histones and many other compounds, which 
are inhibited by their product S-adenosylhomocysteine 
(SAH). The ratio of SAM to SAH is a convenient index of 
gene methylation capacity since the Km values for most 
methyltransferases are similar to the Ki of inhibitory SAH 
 [13] . In addition to its down-regulation of the MTHFR 
reaction, SAM promotes the transsulfuration pathway by 
up-regulation of the activity of C β S [14] . SAH levels are 
also regulated by SAH hydrolase (SAHH), a bidirectional 
enzyme that reduces SAH in production of homocysteine 
in the forward direction or increases SAH in the reverse 
direction when homocysteine levels are elevated. Sum￾marizing, homocysteine levels are regulated by three 
different enzymatic reactions including vitamin B12 
dependent MS, bidirectional SAHH, and C β S, which is 
the initial reaction in the transsulfuration pathway for 
the production of the antioxidant GSH. Both C β S and the 
subsequent rate limiting enzyme cystathionase are regu￾lated by vitamin B6. 
 Hepatic methionine metabolism is profoundly affected 
by chronic alcoholism and experimental exposure to 
ethanol feeding. A clinical study comparing gene expres￾sions in liver biopsies from ALD patients with those in 
control normal liver biopsies found decreased transcripts 
of MS , MAT1A and C β S which could account for observed 
reduced levels of hepatic SAM and GSH [15] . A subsequent 
study of livers from ethanol-fed micropigs that developed 
ALD with a folate deficient diet found decreased transcript 
expressions of MTHFR , MS , MAT1A , and SAHH [16] , which 
accounted for reduced hepatic levels of SAM and the SAM/
SAH ratio with increased levels of homocysteine and SAH 
in this animal model [7] . Whereas two studies found excel￾lent correlations of liver SAM and GSH levels in experi￾mental ALD [7, 17] , others recently linked ethanol induced 
oxidative liver injury in a rat model to reduced SAM and 
GSH levels that were corrected by inhibition of the ethanol 
oxidizing enzyme cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), which 
also induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18] . Summa￾rizing, the data from all these studies provide a strong 
case for the concept that clinical and experimental eth￾anol-induced ALD is promoted by alterations in hepatic 
methionine metabolism, with three potential mecha￾nisms of reduced production of antioxidant GSH second￾ary to reduced levels of SAM and its regulatory effect on 
the transsulfuration pathway, reduced levels of SAM and 
the SAM/SAH methylation ratio that carries potential for 
profound epigenetic dysregulation of genes relevant to 
alcoholic liver injury, and the effect of reduced SAM on 
folate and DNA metabolism by decreasing the availability 
of substrate 5,10-MTHF for accurate nucleotide balance 
in DNA synthesis. Each of these mechanisms that involve 
reduced SAM can be aggravated by B-vitamin deficiency, 
while reduced vitamin B6 would predictably decrease 
GSH production through decreased activity of C β S and 
cystathionase (Figure 1). 
 Evidence and mechanisms for 
B-vitamin deficiencies in chronic 
alcoholism 
 The associations of B-vitamin deficiencies with chronic 
alcoholism has been known for over 45 years, when a 
survey of 140 consecutive patients with ALD admitted to a 
large municipal hospital in the USA found low serum levels 
of folate in 78 % , of vitamin B6 in 60 % , and of vitamin B12 
in 25 % [19] . A contemporary publication described low 
serum folate in 80 % of chronic alcoholic patients admit￾ted to the Boston City Hospital, which was ascribed mainly 
to poor diet and was unrelated to the presence or absence 
of ALD [20] . More recently, chronic alcoholics in Portugal 
were found to have significantly lower red blood cell and 
serum vitamin B6 levels, but, paradoxically, higher serum 
vitamin B12 levels together with higher serum homocys￾teine levels than found in healthy control subjects [21] . 
Since the onset of folic acid fortification of the US diet 
in 1998, the population incidence of low serum and red 
blood cell folate levels has decreased from 24 % and 3 % 
to < 1 % for each [22] . A recent post-folic acid fortification 
study of 77 intoxicated patients in an emergency room 
setting found none with low serum folate or vitamin B12 
levels [23] . There is no reported evidence to date that folic 
acid fortification of the diet has reduced the incidence of 
ALD. However, our recent controlled study found signifi￾cantly lower levels of serum folate and B6 but higher B12 
levels in 40 ALD patients compared to matched healthy 
control subjects, suggesting a significant effect of associ￾ated liver disease on the status of these vitamins [24] . 
 Normal folate physiology 
 Dietary folate consists of folic acid that may be oxidized 
or reduced and methylated as 5-MTHF and is bound 
in gamma peptide linkage with up to seven glutamate 
residues [25] . As depicted in Figure 2 , the metabolism 

460  Halsted: B-Vitamin dependent methionine metabolism and ALD
of dietary folate involves many regulated steps, includ￾ing the initial digestion of dietary pteroylpolyglutamates 
(PteGlu n ) to their pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu) forms 
of folic acid or 5-MTHF by the intestinal brush border 
enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) [26] , which 
is then transported across the apical brush border and the 
basolateral membranes of the enterocytes by the reduced 
folate carrier (RFC) [25] . More recent evidence indicates 
the additional presence of the proton coupled folate 
transporter (PCFT) in the intestinal brush border mem￾brane [27] . Since RFC activity is optimal at a neutral pH 
and PCFT at an acid pH, it is likely that the two transport￾ers act in concert to move monoglutamyl folate from the 
neutral luminal contents across the acid microclimate of 
the brush border membrane [28] . Once at the hepatocyte 
membrane in the liver, the optimal pH for folate transport 
is 5.0 [29] , which is consistent with a folate binding protein 
(FBP) mechanism known to be present in mammalian liver 
 [30] . A complex sequence of re-synthesis of PteGlu n forms 
of folate for hepatic storage is followed by hydrolysis to 
PteGlu as 5-MTHF for subsequent transport to both bile 
and systemic circulation [25] . All but about 1 % of biliary 
folate is reabsorbed and taken back up by the liver, then 
secreted back to the systemic circulation [31] . Within the 
kidney, 5-MTHF is conserved by active re-absorption by 
renal tubular cells in an active process that is mediated by 
both RFC [32] and PCFT [33] . Therefore, there are multiple 
potential causes of folate deficiency that include dietary 
lack, intestinal malabsorption, altered hepatic uptake and 
metabolism, and reduced re-absorption by renal tubular 
cells. Each one of the processes can be involved in the 
chronic alcoholic state. 
 Folate malabsorption in chronic alcoholism 
 Using methods of measuring radioactivity in the systemic 
circulation or its uptake from perfused jejunum, our group 
determined that 3
 H-labeled folic acid was poorly absorbed 
in malnourished chronic alcoholic patients, whereas 
absorption could be normalized by 2 weeks of absti￾nence with a healthy diet [34, 35] . A subsequent study in 
chronic ethanol-fed macaque monkeys found increased 
fecal excretion of radioactivity after oral administration of 
3
 H-labeled folic acid consistent with folate malabsorption 
 [36] . Mechanistic studies found decreased activity of GCPII 
Figure 2   Folate physiology. 
 Folate is present in the diet as a mixture of oxidized, reduced, and methylated pteroylpolyglutamates (PteGlu n
 ), which are hydrolyzed at the 
jejunal (J) brush border membrane by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (1) . The derivative pteroylmonoglutamates (PteGlu) are transported 
across the same membrane (2) by the synergy of the reduced folate carrier and proton coupled folate transporter. PteGlu are transported 
through the portal vein and cross the liver (L) hepatocyte membranes (3) most likely by folate binding protein. Subsequently, PteGlu reacts 
with PteGlu synthetase (4) to reconstitute PteGlu n
 as the storage folate form in the liver. Subsequent hydrolysis of storage PteGlu n
 (5) pro￾duces methylated PteGlu for transport through the enterohepatic folate circulation (EHFC) or systemic folate circulation (SFC). Whereas all 
but 1 % of folate is re-absorbed back to the liver from the EHFC, 90 % of folate circulating through the kidney (K) is reabsorbed by the renal 
tubular membrane (6) probably through the synergy of reduced folate carrier and proton coupled folate transporter mechanisms.

in jejunal brush border vesicles isolated from ethanol-fed 
miniature pigs [37] as well as reduced 3
 H-folic acid trans￾port by jejunal brush border vesicles and reduced tran￾script levels of RFC in ethanol-fed micropigs compared to 
control diet fed animals [38] . Summarizing these studies, 
folate malabsorption was proven in chronic alcoholic 
patients and in both ethanol-fed monkey and pig models 
according to a mechanism that includes decreased  acti￾vity of GCPII and expression and activity of jejunal brush 
border RFC . 
 Effects of alcohol on folate metabolism 
in the liver 
 Whereas the liver is the major storage site for folate in 
the body [39] , the amount of folate stored in the liver is 
markedly reduced in ALD according to a clinical study 
in which the time frame for development of megaloblas￾tic anemia while ingesting a folate free diet was reduced 
by half compared to that found in a healthy subject [40, 
41] . Decreased liver folate stores in ALD could result from 
decreased uptake or from abnormal intrahepatic metab￾olism of the vitamin. Studies in the chronic ethanol-fed 
macaque monkeys with liver folate deficiency showed 
decreased hepatic uptake of 3
 H following intramuscular 
3
 H-folic acid but a normal distribution pattern of intra￾hepatic PteGlu n folates [42] . 
 Effects of alcohol on renal excretion 
of folate 
 Increased urinary folate excretion contributes to folate 
deficiency, as documented in chronic alcoholic subjects 
 [43] , ethanol-fed rats [44] and macaque monkeys [45] . 
Whereas these observations can be explained by an effect 
of acute ethanol on decreasing renal tubular uptake and 
transport of folate in rats [46] , long-term ethanol expo￾sure in micropigs had no effect on the expression of renal 
RFC [38] . 
 Effects of alcoholism on vitamin 
B6 and B12 status 
 Vitamin B6 deficiency occurs in about two-thirds of 
chronic alcoholics with liver disease with overall signifi￾cantly lower levels than in normal subjects [21, 47] . One 
of the principal clinical manifestations of vitamin B6 
deficiency in alcoholism is sideroblastic anemia as was 
found by bone marrow examination in 23 % of a sequential 
series of hospitalized anemic chronic alcoholic patients 
 [48] . Vitamin B6 circulates in the form of protein bound 
pyridoxal phosphate, and the most widely accepted eti￾ology for vitamin B6 deficiency is the degrading effect of 
the acetaldehyde product of alcohol metabolism on this 
compound with subsequent urinary wastage of the free 
vitamin [49, 50] . By contrast, circulating levels of vitamin 
B12 are often elevated in ALD [21, 24] , even though its 
absorption from the intestine is compromised by chronic 
alcoholism [51] . This apparent conundrum was resolved 
by a clinical study of patients with active ALD that showed 
reduced liver vitamin B12 levels in spite of elevated serum 
levels of vitamin B12 and its analogs, suggesting an ina￾bility of compromised hepatocytes to retain vitamin B12 
stores [52] . The deficiency of vitamin B12 in the liver of 
ALD patients is critical to substantiating its potential role 
in aberrant methionine metabolism. 
 Aberrant hepatic methionine 
metabolism in the pathogenesis 
of alcoholic liver disease 
 Whereas B-vitamin deficiencies are common in chronic 
alcoholism, continuously emerging data indicate that 
these deficiencies and their impacts on hepatic methio￾nine metabolism may play highly significant roles in the 
pathogenesis of ALD. For example, a study of intragastric 
ethanol-fed mice found elevated plasma homocysteine 
and activations of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress path￾ways for steatosis and apoptosis, all of which could be pre￾vented by co-administration of betaine [53] , while the co￾administration of SAM to ethanol-fed baboons increased 
hepatic GSH while attenuating liver pathology of ALD [17] . 
Studies of hepatocytes from ethanol-fed mice associated 
elevated SAH levels with increased sensitization of injury 
pathways to tumor necrosis factor (TNF α ) [54] . The inclu￾sion of dietary folate deficiency with ethanol feeding of 
micropigs accelerated the onset of the pathology of ALD 
while increasing plasma homocysteine levels and decreas￾ing liver SAM, the SAM to SAH ratio and GSH levels [7] , as 
well as reducing the expressions of relevant transmeth￾ylation enzymes [16] . Subsequent studies of livers from 
the same ethanol and control diet fed micropigs demon￾strated augmenting effects of the folate deficient diets 
on the expressions of ethanol-induced enzymes involved 
in ER stress pathways of lipogenesis and apoptosis [55] . 

462  Halsted: B-Vitamin dependent methionine metabolism and ALD
Additional studies found that the pathology of ALD, 
abnormalities in hepatic methionine metabolism, and 
activations of ER stress pathways of lipogenesis and apo￾ptosis and of oxidative liver injury could be prevented by 
the co-administration of SAM with ethanol in folate defi￾cient diets in micropigs [56, 57] . The positive effects of 
SAM on ALD prevention could be ascribed to promotion 
of antioxidative GSH levels [57] and reducing the expres￾sions of genes relevant to steatosis [56] and oxidative liver 
injury [56, 57] . 
 Aberrant hepatic methionine 
metabolism in the epigenetic 
regulation of ALD 
 Accumulating evidence indicates that pathways of alco￾holic liver injury are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms 
that are influenced by intrahepatic methylation reac￾tions. Since SAM is the principal donor for methylation 
reactions, ethanol induced alterations in hepatic methio￾nine metabolism and the SAM to SAH methylation ratio 
are directly germane to these epigenetic phenomena. 
According to recent reviews, epigenetic regulation in ALD 
involves both DNA and histone methylation that can be 
altered by ethanol exposure [58, 59] . For example, chronic 
ethanol-fed rats demonstrated decreased SAM levels and 
global DNA methylation that was also associated with 
DNA strand breaks [8] . The expressions of several histone 
MTs in isolated rat hepatocytes were affected by ethanol 
exposure, resulting in activations of histone residues at 
H3K4 and suppression at H3K9 that altered the expres￾sions of genes relevant to alcoholic liver injury [60] . Our 
recent study of ethanol-fed C β S deficient mice demon￾strated the association of activated ER stress gene path￾ways with reduced expression of the histone methyltrans￾ferase G9 and reduced levels of lysine residue H3K9 that 
affected promoter regions of relevant genes according to 
chromatin histone immunoprecipitation assays [61] . 
 Efficacy of SAM in the treatment 
of ALD 
 Whereas numerous studies in ethanol-fed rodents, 
baboons, and micropigs have demonstrated positive pre￾ventive effects of methyl donors such as betaine [10, 53, 
62 – 65] or SAM [17, 56, 57] in experimental ALD, there is 
no consensus on whether either compound is effective in 
reversing liver injury in the treatment of established clini￾cal ALD. An Italian study of 17 ALD patients showed that 
6 months of SAM at 1.2 g per day was effective in raising 
liver GSH levels, but did not report on its potential effects 
on histopathology [66] . A subsequent 2-year multicenter 
European study of 123 ALD patients randomized to receive 
placebo or SAM in the same dose showed reduction in 
mortality or liver transplant incidence in the SAM group, 
but this was only significant only after excluding the 
most severely ill patients from the analysis [67] . A later 
Cochrane meta-analysis of data from 434 patients in nine 
clinical trials found no differences in efficacy between 
SAM or placebo in treatment of clinical ALD [68] . Of note, 
none of these clinical trials reported on treatment effects 
on liver histopathology, which should be presumed to be 
the gold standard for demonstrated efficacy. 
 Recently, our group reported on a 6 month trial on 
the efficacy of SAM at 1.2 g/day in the treatment of ALD. 
Unlike the prior studies noted above, our additional goals 
were to determine potential mechanisms for SAM efficacy 
and its potential effects on biochemical parameters at 2 – 4 
week intervals and on the histopathology of ALD accord￾ing to liver biopsies that were obtained at baseline and 
at completion of the study [69] . An initial baseline study 
compared serum B-vitamin levels and methionine metab￾olites in 40 ALD patients, 26 chronic and actively drinking 
alcoholics without liver disease, and 28 healthy control 
subjects [24] . Whereas serum folate levels were relatively 
decreased in both alcoholic groups compared to controls, 
serum vitamin B6 levels were lower and vitamin B12 levels 
were elevated only in the ALD group compared to findings 
in the other two groups. Evaluation of methionine metab￾olites found elevated serum homocysteine and SAH levels 
in both alcoholic groups, whereas serum SAM levels were 
elevated in ALD patients compared to the other groups. 
Additionally, serum cystathionine was elevated and its 
ratio to α -aminobutyrate, the product of the vitamin 
B6-dependent cystathionase reaction, was decreased in 
the ALD group and was predictive of the presence of early 
cirrhosis in a subset of 24 ALD patient liver biopsies. Sum￾marizing, this initial analysis demonstrated significant 
vitamin B6 deficiency in ALD patients that was associated 
with decreased cystathionase activity (Figure 1) which 
correlated with the severity of liver disease. 
 In the subsequent clinical study, 26 of 37 enrolled 
ALD patients completed a 24 week trial, receiving either 
SAM at a dose of 1.2 g per day or size, shape, and color 
matched placebo pills each in three daily doses [69] . All 
subjects were required to remain abstinent during the 
trial and both baseline and end-point liver biopsies were 

 Halsted: B-Vitamin dependent methionine metabolism and ALD  463
obtained in six and eight subjects in each group. While 
levels of liver function tests improved with time in all 
patients, consistent with an abstinence effect, there were 
no group differences in this clinical response to either 
regimen. While there were no differences between the two 
groups in levels of serum SAH or homocysteine levels over 
time, SAM serum levels were increased during treatment 
compared to baseline, indicative of an adequate systemic 
response. Comparing liver histopathology scores in base￾line and end-point biopsies, there were no changes of total 
scores within or between the two groups, although slight 
improvement in steatosis and inflammation was found 
in the placebo group but not in the SAM group. Summa￾rizing these data, SAM was ineffective as a treatment for 
ALD in our study according to biochemical and histo￾logical parameters. Potential reasons for these negative 
results include relatively short 6 month period of treat￾ment compared to the prior 2-year multicenter trial [67] , 
and a 30 % dropout rate due to recidivism of alcoholism 
during the course of the treatment protocol. The finding 
of elevated serum SAM levels in both groups at baseline 
suggests incomplete hepatic retention and/or subsequent 
abnormal intrahepatic metabolism of SAM that would be 
required for a potential clinical effect. 
 Summarizing these clinical studies, there is no con￾sensus on the efficacy of SAM in the treatment of clini￾cal ALD, contrary to expectations from effective preven￾tive trials in experimental ethanol-fed animal models. 
Prior extensive clinical trials did not assess changes in 
histopathology. Our recent clinical studies demonstrated 
a potentially significant role of vitamin B6 in the patho￾genesis of ALD, suggesting the importance of assuring 
adequate levels of this vitamin in future treatment trials. 
Lack of efficacy of SAM in treatment of ALD may reflect 
inability of damaged hepatocytes to retain and metabolize 
this compound in such a way as to improve parameters of 
alcoholic liver injury.
