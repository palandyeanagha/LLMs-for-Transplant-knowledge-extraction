Hepatitis E, an important human disease, is characterized by
explosive outbreaks of acute hepatitis in developing countries,
and sporadic and cluster cases of hepatitis E in industrialized
countries.1,2 The causative agent, hepatitis E virus (HEV), has
been genetically identified from humans and several other
animal species including pig, chicken, deer, mongoose, rabbit,
rat, ferret, and fish.3–5 The host range and diversity of HEV have
been significantly expanded in recent years. Hepatitis E is now
a recognized zoonotic disease, and pigs and likely other animal
species are reservoirs for HEV (►Fig.1).5 Direct contact with
infected animals and consumption of contaminated animal
meat and meat products have been linked to sporadic and
cluster cases of acute hepatitis E, thus raising concerns over
zoonosis and food safety.3 Recently, genotype 3 HEV-associat￾ed persistent infection has become a significant clinical prob￾lem in immunocompromised individuals,6,7 which further
underscores the clinical importance of these zoonotic geno￾types 3 and 4 HEV strains. Here the natural history and
emerging zoonotic risks of HEV are reviewed with emphases
on the zoonotic and foodborne transmissions of the virus and
potential strategies to prevent zoonosis and ensure food safety.
Hepatitis E Virus Nomenclature
HEV belongs to the family Hepeviridae, and according to the 9th
Report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV),8 currently there is a single genus Hepevirus
within the family along with a floating species of avian HEV.

Abstract Hepatitis E is an important disease in many developing countries of Asia and Africa with
large explosive outbreaks and is also endemic with sporadic or cluster cases of hepatitis
in many industrialized countries. The causative agent, hepatitis E virus (HEV), is currently
classified in the family Hepeviridae. Thus far, four putative genera of HEV representing
mammalian, avian, and fish species have been identified and characterized worldwide.
Within the mammalian HEV that infects humans, genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with
epidemics and restricted to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and
associated with sporadic and cluster cases of hepatitis E. As a fecal–orally transmitted
disease, waterborne transmission is still an important route of HEV transmission
especially for large outbreaks associated with genotypes 1 and 2. However, genetic
identification of numerous animal strains of HEV and the demonstrated ability of cross￾species infection by these animal strains have significantly broadened the host range
and diversity of HEV and raised public health concerns for zoonosis and food safety
associated with genotypes 3 and 4 HEV infection. Pigs and likely other animal species
serve as reservoirs for HEV. Direct contact with infected pigs and other animals and
consumption of contaminated animal meat and meat products pose risks for HEV
infection. In this article, the current understanding of the zoonotic and foodborne
transmissions of HEV as well as strategies to prevent zoonosis and ensure food safety is
discussed.

The viruses within the genus Hepevirus all infect mammals and
have been genetically identified from humans, pig, mongoose,
deer, rat, rabbit, and ferret (►Fig. 1). However, the recent
identification of genetically and phylogenetically distinct
strains of HEV from several other animal species such as fish
and bat9,10 warrant reclassification of HEV in the near future.
The genus Hepevirus includes four recognized genotypes
and at least two putative new genotypes.8 Genotype 1 HEV
consists of Asian strains of human HEV that are responsible
for large outbreaks in humans. Genotype 2 HEV consists of a
single Mexican strain and some African strains of human HEV
and is also associated with epidemics in humans. Genotype 3
HEV contains strains from sporadic, cluster, and chronic cases
of hepatitis E in humans and from several animal species
including pig, deer, rat, mongoose, and rabbit. Genotype 4
HEV includes strains from sporadic and cluster cases of
hepatitis E in humans and animal HEV strains from pigs
and possibly cattle and sheep.3 The two putative new geno￾types of mammalian hepeviruses include strains of HEV from
rat and ferret,11–13 and a novel strain of HEV from wild boars
in Japan.14,15 A tentative genus Orthohepevirus is proposed
here to include all these mammalian strains of HEV
(►Table 1).
Avian HEV from chicken16 is currently classified as a
floating species within the family Hepeviridae.
8 However,
avian HEV is genetically and phylogenetically distinct from
the mammalian hepeviruses sharing only 50% nucleotide
sequence identity.17–19 Therefore, avian HEV should be clas￾sified as a separate genus,4,20 and the tentative genus Avihe￾pevirus is proposed here to include all three genotypes of
avian HEV worldwide: genotype 1 from chickens in Australia
and Korea, genotype 2 from chickens in the United States, and
genotype 3 from chickens in Europe and China.19,21,22
The novel strain of HEV, cutthroat trout virus (CTV)10
isolated from spawning adult trout in the United States,
belongs to a new genus as well, and the tentative genus
Piscihepevirus is proposed here for CTV. The novel strain of
HEV recently identified from bats9 is also phylogenetically
distinct from the known HEV strains, and thus is proposed to
form a tentative genus Chiropteranhepevirus (►Table 1).
The Ever-Expanding Host Range of HEV
Genetic identification of HEV strains from various animal
hosts and the demonstration of cross-species infection by
some animal strains of HEV have broadened the host range
and genetic diversity of virus (►Table 1).3,5

Domestic Pig
The first animal strain of HEV, swine hepatitis E virus (swine
HEV), was identified and characterized in 1997 from domes￾tic pigs in the United States.23 Thus far, two genotypes of HEV,
genotypes 3 and 4, have been identified from pigs worldwide.
HEV infection is widespread in swine farms and generally
infects pigs of 2 to 4 months of age. The infected pigs are
subclinical and generally have a transient viremia lasting for 1
to 2 weeks, and fecal virus shedding lasting for approximately
3 to 7 weeks. Gross pathological lesions were absent in the
liver, although microscopic lesions of hepatitis characterized
by multifocal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis and focal hepato￾cellular necrosis were observed.24 The transmission route for
HEV in pigs is fecal–oral and virus-containing feces are the
main source of virus for transmission. However, under exper￾imental conditions, infection of pigs with HEV via the oral
route of inoculation has been difficult, even though pigs can
be readily infected via the intravenous route of inocula￾tion.25,26 How HEV maintains in swine herds remains un￾known; both genotypes 3 and 4 HEV from pigs are zoonotic
and infect humans.
Wild Boar
Free-living wild boars (Sus scrofa) that are indigenous in
many countries are known to harbor HEV.27 Human habita￾tion changes from rural to suburban areas, increased agricul￾tural use of lands, deforestation, recreational hunting, and
consumption of wild boar meats have increased the chances
of contact exposure of wild boars to humans.27 The HEV
strains identified in wild boars worldwide are mostly geno￾type 3, although strains belonging to genotype 4 as well as a
putative new genotype have also been detected in wild
boars.14,15 Like domestic pigs, the genotypes 3 and 4 HEV
from wild boars infect humans.
Chicken
Avian hepatitis E virus (avian HEV) was genetically identified
from chickens with hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome (HSS)
in the United States.16 Avian HEV shares approximately 80%
nucleotide sequence identity with the big liver and spleen
disease virus (BLSV) from chickens in Australia,18,28 suggest￾ing that BLS in Australia and HSS in the United States are
caused by variant strains of the same virus. Avian HEV shares
50 to 60% nucleotide sequence identities and common
antigenic epitopes in the capsid protein with human
HEVs.18 At least three genotypes of avian HEV have been
identified from chickens worldwide.19,21 In the United States,
HEV infection in chickens is enzootic, and approximately 71%
of chicken flocks and 30% of chickens were seropositive for
avian HEV antibodies.17,29 The morbidity and mortality of
HSS or BLS associated with avian HEV infection are low, and
avian HEV infection in chickens is mostly subclinical. Gross
lesions including subcapsular hemorrhages and enlarged
livers were present in some but not all infected chickens,
and microscopic hepatitis lesions are characterized by lym￾phocytic periphlebitis and phlebitis in the livers.30,31 Evi￾dence of avian HEV infection in humans is currently
lacking.32
Rat
Strains of HEV have now been genetically identified from
various species of rats.11,12,33 The rat HEV shared only
approximately 60% and 50% sequence identity with other
mammalian HEV and avian HEV, respectively, and thus
belongs to a putative new genotype within the proposed
Orthohepevirus genus. It remains to be determined if this
putative new genotype of rat HEV can infect humans. Most
recently, strains of HEV belonging to the genotype 3 have also
been identified from rats in the United States,34 suggesting
that some strains of rat HEV are likely zoonotic and may infect
humans.
Rabbit
A genetically distinct strain of HEV that is related to genotype
3 was identified from rabbits in China,35 the United States,36
and France.37 The rabbit HEV shares approximately 74%, 73%,
78 to 79%, 74 to 75%, and 46 to 47% nucleotide sequence
identity with genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 HEV, and avian HEV,
respectively. The capsid protein of the rabbit HEV cross￾reacted with antibodies raised against avian, rat, swine, and
human HEV.38 Since the rabbit HEV belongs to the zoonotic
genotype 3, thus the rabbit HEV may infect humans. Under
experimental conditions, the rabbit HEV was successfully
transmitted to pigs,38 further demonstrating the ability of
cross-species infection by rabbit HEV.
Deer
Antibodies to HEV have been detected in sika deer, Yezo deer,
and red deer.39–41 Strains of genotype 3 HEV have been
genetically identified from sika deer in Japan and roe deer
in Hungary.42,43 HEV transmission from deer to humans via
the consumption of contaminated deer meat has been
documented.44,45
Mongoose
Approximately 8 to 21% of the mongooses in Japan were
seropositive for HEV antibodies.46 Strains of genotype 3 HEV
have been genetically identified from mongoose.47 Whether
the mongoose HEV infects humans remains unknown, al￾though genotype 3 HEV is known to be zoonotic.
Bat
Drexler et al9 tested 3,869 bat samples from 85 different bat
species worldwide for HEV RNA. Novel strains of HEV were
identified from African, Central American, and European
bats. The bat HEV forms a novel phylogenetic clade belong￾ing to a separate genus within the family Hepeviridae.
Evidence of HEV transmission from bats to humans was
absent.
Ferret
A unique strain of HEV was genetically identified from ferrets
in the Netherlands.13 The ferret HEV shared the highest
nucleotide sequence identity (72.3%) with the putative new
genotype of rat HEV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the
ferret HEV was distinct from the known genotype 1–4
mammalian HEV in the proposed Orthohepevirus genus and

clustered with the putative new genotype of rat HEV
(►Table 1).
Fish
The CTV isolated from spawning adult trout in the United
States10 shares only approximately 13 to 27% amino acid
sequence identity with the proposed genera Orthohepevirus
and Avihepevirus, and therefore likely belongs to another new
proposed genus Piscihepevirus (►Table 1). Unlike other
strains of HEV, CTV can be efficiently propagated in the
Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214) cell line.
Cattle
Antibodies to HEV have been detected in cattle from different
countries. A 189-bp sequence of HEV was reportedly ampli￾fied from the fecal samples of eight cows in China, and the
bovine HEV appears to be a genotype 4.48
Sheep
Serological evidence of HEV infection in sheep has been
reported in China and Spain. A short 189-bp sequence of
HEV was amplified from six sheep fecal samples in China by
the same laboratory that reported the sequence of bovine
HEV,49 and the sheep HEV also appears to be a genotype 4. The
genotype 4 HEV-like sequences reportedly amplified from
sheep and cattle require further independent confirmation.
Other Potential Animal Reservoirs
In addition to the animal species described above from which
strains of HEV have been genetically identified, serological
evidence of HEV infection has been reported in several other
animal species such as dog, cat, goat, and nonhuman pri￾mates,50,51 suggesting that these animals have been exposed
to HEV as well. Identification of the source of seropositivity
from these animal species will likely discover new HEV
strains and further expand the host range and animal reser￾voirs of HEV.
Zoonotic Transmission of HEV
Zoonotic transmission is responsible for the sporadic and
cluster cases of human hepatitis E caused by genotypes 3 and
4.5 Cases of persistent hepatitis E in immunocompromised
individuals are also linked to the zoonotic genotype 3 HEV
infection.4
Cross-Species Infection by HEV
Genotypes 1 and 2 HEV have a limited host range and are
restricted to humans: Attempts to experimentally infect pig,
rat, and goat with genotypes 1 and 2 human HEV were
unsuccessful.52,53 In contrast, genotypes 3 and 4 HEV have
a much broader host range and can infect across species
barriers: genotypes 3 and 4 swine HEV infected nonhuman
primates,54,55 and conversely genotypes 3 and 4 human HEV
infected pigs.24,54,56,57 Cross-species HEV infection has also
been reported in other animal species (►Fig. 1). Lambs and
Wistar rats were reportedly infected by human HEV isolates
of presumably genotype 1 origin,58,59 although others failed
to infect goats or rat with genotypes 1 and 2 HEV.53 The avian
HEV from a chicken successfully infected turkeys,60 but failed
to infect two rhesus monkeys,32 suggesting that avian HEV is
likely not zoonotic and may not infect humans. The strains of
HEV from rabbits infected pigs38 and genotypes 1 and 4
human HEV also reportedly infected rabbits.61 The mecha￾nisms and genetic determinant(s) of cross-species HEV infec￾tion remain unknown.
Pigs as a Reservoir for Zoonotic HEV Transmission
It has been demonstrated that pig handlers such as pig farmers
and swine veterinarians are at increased risk of HEV infec￾tion.62–67 For example, swine veterinarians in the United States
were 1.51 times more likely to be positive for HEV antibodies
than age- and geography-matched normal blood donors.62
Individuals from traditionally major swine states such as
Minnesota are more likely seropositive for HEV antibodies
than those from traditionally nonswine States such as Alabama.
In North Carolina, swine workers had a 4.5-fold higher HEV
antibody prevalence rate than the control subjects.68 In Mol￾dova, approximately 51% of swine farmers were seropositive for
HEV antibodies, whereas only 25% of control subjects with no
occupational exposure to swine were seropositive.65 Pig is now
a recognized reservoir for zoonotic HEV infection, and direct
human contact with infected pigs poses a risk for HEV infection.
Other Animal Reservoirs for Zoonotic HEV
Transmission
In addition to pigs, other animal species such as deer and rabbit
also serve as potential reservoirs for HEV. For examples,
zoonotic transmissions of hepatitis E from deer to humans
and from a pet cat to human owner were reported.44,45,69,70
Workers from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) who had contacts with wildlife animal species had a
higher HEV antibody prevalence rate than normal blood
donors (p < 0.05).71 Understanding the natural history and
mechanisms of cross-species infection of HEV will be critical
for effectively preventing zoonotic human infection by HEV.
Zoonotic Source of Virus for Persistent Infection in
Immunocompromised Individuals
Recently, persistent HEV infection has become an emerging
and significant clinical problem with considerable morbidity
and mortality in immunocompromised individuals such as
organ transplant recipients,6,7,72–75 patients with HIV infec￾tions,76–80 non-Hodgkin lymphoma,81 and lymphoblastic
leukemia.82 Approximately 58 to 92% of the HEV-infected
organ transplant recipients developed persistent infec￾tion.7,83,84 Thus far, cases of persistent infections are almost
exclusively caused by strains of HEV belonging to the geno￾type 3,72,84 suggesting that the source of infection is likely
zoonotic in nature.83,85 In immunocompetent individuals, a
lower dose of virus exposure through direct contact with
infected animals or consumption of undercooked animal
meat may only result in subclinical or self-limiting acute
infection because hepatitis E is known to be a dose-dependent
disease: A high dose causes biochemical and clinical hepatitis
whereas a low dose causes only subclinical infection.86
Seminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 No. 1/2013

However, in immunocompromised individuals that cannot
effectively clear the virus even exposed at a low dose, the
infection can progress into chronicity. Therefore, individuals
with immunosuppressive conditions should avoid eating
undercooked animal meat or contact with potentially HEV￾infected animals.
Foodborne Transmission of HEV
Animal Meat Products as the Sources for Foodborne
Transmission
Approximately 2% of the pig livers sold in local grocery stores
in Japan,87 4% in Germany,88 6.5% in the Netherlands,89 and
11% in the United States90 tested positive for the zoonotic
genotype 3 HEV RNA. The contaminating virus in the com￾mercial pig livers remains fully infectious,90 and incubation of
the contaminated meat at a temperature (56°C) equivalent to
a medium-to-rare cooking condition did not inactivate the
virus completely.91 Many sporadic and cluster cases of hepa￾titis E have been linked to the consumption of contaminated
raw or undercooked animal meat and meat products.92–95 For
example, severe hepatitis E developed in a Japanese man after
consumption of contaminated wild boar meat; another man
contracted fulminant hepatitis after eating the same wild
boar meat.93,94 The zoonotic genotype 4 HEV was detected
from the patient serum and wild boars with indistinguishable
nucleotide sequences. A cluster case of hepatitis E patients
was linked to the consumption of raw deer meats in Japan.44
Importantly, the HEV sequence amplified from the leftover
frozen deer meat was nearly identical to the HEV sequence
amplified from the patients. Additionally, consumption of
game meat is also a risk factor for HEV infection.83
It appears that large pork production chains in some
countries are contaminated by HEV, which raises a public
health concern for potential foodborne HEV transmission
because of the high-volume consumption of pork products
worldwide. In the United Kingdom, HEV was detected in pig
livers in a slaughterhouse, in surface samples from a process￾ing plant, and in pork sausages and surface samples at the
point of sale.96 In Czech Republic, Italy, and Spain, among the
337 fecal, liver, and meat samples from pigs at slaughter￾houses tested, HEV RNA was detected in 41% (Italy) and 41%
(Spain) fecal samples, 5% liver and 2.5% meat (Czech Repub￾lic).97 Approximately 6% of the sausages sampled at process￾ing and at the point of sale in Spain were also positive for
genotype 3 HEV RNA.97 In France, pig liver sausages (figatelli)
were responsible for some sporadic cases of hepatitis E.98
Acute or recent HEV infection was observed in 7 of 13
individuals who ate figatellu, but in none of the 5 individuals
who did not eat figatellu. The genotype 3 HEV sequences
amplified from 7 of the 12 figatelli from supermarkets were
genetically linked to the patients who ate figatellu. In Japan,
foodborne HEV transmission has been demonstrated in Ki￾tami and Abashiri via consumption of grilled pig entrails.99
The potential widespread dissemination of HEV through
pork production chains and the hidden danger of potential
subsequent foodborne transmission especially in immuno￾compromised individuals are of significant concerns.100
Taken together, these data clearly showed that foodborne
transmission is an important route of HEV transmission that
is responsible for the sporadic and cluster cases of hepatitis E
worldwide.
Contaminated Shellfish as the Source for Foodborne
Transmission
HEV replicates in the liver as well as in gastrointestinal
tract,56,101 and infected humans and other animals excreted
large amounts of HEV in feces,57,102 which poses a concern for
environmental contamination and food safety. HEV has been
detected in swine manure and wastewater associated with
hog operations,71 and in concrete pits and lagoons of swine
manure storage facilities in the United States.102 Genotype 3
HEV RNA was detected in swine manure collected from
concrete holding pits and from lagoons on pig farms; impor￾tantly, the HEV detected in pig manure slurry remains infec￾tious.102 In Korea, HEV RNA resembling the genotype 3 swine
HEV was detected in oysters.103 Consumption of contaminat￾ed shellfish has been implicated in sporadic cases of acute
hepatitis E.104–106 An outbreak of hepatitis E on a cruise ship
was linked to the consumption of shellfish while on board.107
Therefore, contaminated shellfish is an emerging source of
foodborne HEV transmission.
Contaminated Water as the Source for Foodborne and
Waterborne Transmission
Contamination of water by HEV from human and other animal
wastes can lead to subsequent contamination of food and
produce, and thus leading to potential foodborne transmis￾sion.3,108,109 Historically, waterborne epidemics are the char￾acteristic of hepatitis E outbreaks in humans in regions where
sanitation conditions are poor.1 Untreated sewage water con￾tamination of drinking water and contaminated well or river
water used for washing and drinking purpose are the main
sources of HEV transmission in developing countries.110 In
India, a significantly higher prevalence of HEV antibodies was
detected in sewage workers (57%) than in controls (19%), and
sewage workers with >5 years of employment history had a
much higher seropositivity rate.111 In HEV endemic regions,
the use of river water for bathing, waste disposal, and drinking
purposes is also a significant risk factor.112–115 In Turkey,
individuals who used untreated waste water for irrigation
purposes have a significant higher HEV antibody prevalence
rate (34.8%) than the control subjects with similar age and
socioeconomic status.116
In industrialized countries with good sanitation condi￾tions and water treatment measures, outbreaks of water￾borne HEV transmission are rare. However, the existence of
numerous zoonotic strains of HEV from various animal
species implies that land application and runoffs of HEV￾containing animal manure and feces could contaminate irri￾gation or coastal water with concomitant contamination of
produce or shellfish,3,102,109 thus posing a risk of foodborne
and waterborne HEV transmission. For example, in Canada,
genotype 3 HEV of swine origin was detected on irrigated
field-grown strawberries; irrigation water was suspected as
the source of the strawberry contamination.117 Strains of

infectious HEV of both human and swine origins have been
detected in sewage water in industrialized countries.118–122
Therefore, contaminated water could be a source of food
contamination, thus leading to foodborne HEV transmission.
Other Uncommon Routes of HEV
Transmission
Vertical Transmission
Vertical HEV transmissions from mother-to-fetus were re￾portedly associated with a high neonatal mortality, including
premature birth, increased fetal loss and acute hepatitis in the
newborns.123–125 For example, vertical HEV transmission was
detected in approximately 33% of HEV-infected pregnant
women.124 HEV RNA was reportedly detected in the colos￾trum of HEV-infected mothers, although breast-feeding ap￾pears to be safe for the infants.126 Under experimental
conditions, however, vertical HEV transmission in animal
models has not been demonstrated. For example, infectious
HEV was detected in egg whites from embryonated eggs
hatched from chickens infected experimentally with an avian
strain of HEV, but there was no evidence of complete vertical
transmission.127 Also, pregnant sows inoculated with a geno￾type 3 HEV became infected, but vertical transmission to the
fetuses was not detected.128 Similarly, pregnant rhesus mac￾aques experimentally infected with HEV failed to transmit the
virus to offspring.129 Therefore, further in-depth studies are
warranted to definitively understand the potential risk of
vertical HEV transmission.
Blood-Borne Transmission
Bloodborne transmission of HEV through blood transfusions,
although rare, has been documented.95,130–134 For example,
some blood donors have tested positive for HEV RNA. In Japan,
HEV RNA was detected in 8 of the 41 blood donors with
elevated ALT levels.135–138 Screening donor blood for acute
markers of HEV infection will reduce the risk of potential
bloodborne transmission.
Prevention of Foodborne and Zoonotic
Transmission of HEV
A vaccine against HEV in humans was recently licensed for use
in China, but not in other countries.139 In the absence of a
vaccine in most parts of the world, preventive measures such
as good hygiene practice and avoidance of drinking water of
unknown purity are necessary to minimize the risk of HEV
infection. Because swine and several other animal species are
reservoirs for HEV, an important measure to prevent zoonotic
infection is to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
after handling pigs and other infected animals. The majority
of the sporadic and cluster cases of hepatitis E are associated
with the consumption of raw or undercooked animal meat
products; therefore, an important preventive measure for
foodborne HEV transmission, especially in immunocompro￾mised individuals, is to avoid eating undercooked animal
meat. Even though HEV infection in pigs is nonpathogenic,
it will still be advantageous for the swine industry to develop
a vaccine against HEV infections in pigs because such an
animal vaccine will minimize the risk of zoonotic transmis￾sion and increase pork safety.3
