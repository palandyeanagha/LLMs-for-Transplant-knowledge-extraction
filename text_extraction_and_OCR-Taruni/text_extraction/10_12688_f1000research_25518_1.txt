Abstract
Acute mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are widely used in
cardiogenic shock (CS) despite a lack of high-quality clinical evidence
to guide their use. Multiple devices exist across a spectrum from
modest to complete support, and each is associated with unique risks.
In this review, we summarize existing data on complications
associated with the three most widely used acute MCS platforms: the
intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella systems, and veno-arterial
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). We review
evidence from available randomized trials and highlight challenges
comparing complication rates from case series and comparative
observational studies where a lack of granular data precludes
appropriate matching of patients by CS severity. We further offer a
series of best practices to help shock practitioners minimize the risk of
MCS-associated complications and ensure the best possible outcomes
for patients.

Acute mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic 
shock
Cardiogenic shock (CS) is an advanced state of hemodynamic
compromise representing a convergent endpoint of cardiac 
decompensation resulting from acute myocardial infarction, 
end-stage heart failure, myocarditis, and various other conditions.
In-hospital mortality in CS remains unacceptably high, with 
recent estimates ranging from 27–51%1
. Historically, CS has 
been managed largely with intravenous inotropes and 
vasopressors, medications which improve systemic perfusion 
at the cost of worsening myocardial supply/demand imbalance. 
Despite seeming to temporarily improve hemodynamic indices
and traditional markers of tissue perfusion, empiric studies
have shown that escalating inotropes and vasopressors fail to 
meaningfully reverse the downward hemodynamic spiral that 
occurs in CS, with very poor survival observed in patients 
requiring multiple agents2
.
Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are commonly 
used to augment cardiac output and decouple systemic perfusion 
from native myocardial energy expenditure in CS. The intra￾aortic balloon pump (IABP) was first applied in CS in the late 
1960s, promising to improve hemodynamics through balloon 
counterpulsation synchronized with the cardiac cycle3
. The 
IABP became widely used and gained a class I indication for 
CS until the landmark IABP-SHOCK II trial showed that it 
failed to improve short- or long-term mortality in acute myocar￾dial infarction complicated by CS (AMICS)4–6
. Over the past 
decade, several other acute MCS platforms capable of provid￾ing much greater support have been developed and adopted 
to varying degrees in clinical practice. The trans-valvular
axial flow pumps such as the Impella device (Abiomed, 
Danvers, MA) directly unload the left ventricle, capable of 
providing between 3 and 5.5 L/minute of flow while reduc￾ing native myocardial oxygen demand7
. A percutaneous right 
ventricular Impella device (Impella RP) is also available, which 
bypasses the right ventricle by displacing blood from the right 
atrium to pulmonary artery8
.
The TandemHeart device (CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, PA) 
consists of a left atrial drainage cannula connected to an 
extracorporeal centrifugal flow pump, which returns blood to 
the descending aorta at flow rates of up to 5 L/minute7
. Because 
of the technical complexity and complications associated with 
the need for trans-septal puncture for delivery of the left atrial 
drainage cannula, the TandemHeart device is less commonly 
used in contemporary practice and thus will be only briefly 
discussed here. Finally, veno-arterial extracorporeal mem￾brane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), a peripheral modification of 
cardiopulmonary bypass, is the only device which provides 
full systemic circulatory and respiratory support, though at the 
cost of increased left ventricular afterload9
. Recognizing the 
futility of escalating inotropes as well as the imperative to 
effectively intervene before impaired systemic perfusion 
progresses to an irreversible state of widespread metabolic fail￾ure, we and others have proposed CS management algorithms 
which incorporate early application of these advanced MCS 
platforms, with device selection tailored to the individual patient’s 
hemodynamic profile10–13.
Putting recent safety signals into context
All MCS devices are associated with risk. This risk is increased 
among patients in CS who are commonly treated with 
vasoconstrictive agents, anticoagulants, and anti-platelet 
drugs, and may be exposed to other devices requiring large 
bore access such as hemodialysis catheters, pulmonary artery 
catheters, and other venous or arterial sheaths for monitoring and 
drug delivery. Use of large-bore MCS access along with a 
requirement for systemic anticoagulation increases the risk 
for bleeding, limb ischemia, and stroke14. Intravascular shear 
and varying degrees of hemocompatibility with non-biologic 
surfaces can induce hemolysis, which in combination with sys￾temic inflammation and thromboembolism can predispose
to renal failure, with significant prognostic implications15. 
Understanding the relative risks of these various complications 
with different MCS devices and their implications for device 
selection in patients has been extremely challenging.
Straightforward comparison of complication rates across devices 
is possible only by using data from randomized trials in which 
equivalent patients are randomized to different device strate￾gies. Complication rates observed in randomized trials per￾formed to date are summarized in Table 1. The IABP-SHOCK II 
trial was the largest randomized trial of an MCS device per￾formed in CS to date and reported low rates of bleeding, limb 
ischemia, and stroke in both the IABP and medical therapy 
arms4
. Two small randomized trials comparing the TandemHeart 
device to IABP showed a clear signal toward higher rates of 
bleeding and limb ischemia with TandemHeart, though these 
trends were significant in only one of the two studies16,17. 
Three small, underpowered randomized trials have been 
conducted evaluating the use of Impella in CS. The ISAR-SHOCK 
(Efficacy Study of LV Assist Device to Treat Patients with 
Cardiogenic Shock) trial was a small study (n = 25) compar￾ing the early generation Impella 2.5 to IABP, powered for a 
surrogate endpoint of hemodynamic improvement 30 minutes 
after device insertion18. A numerically higher incidence 
of bleeding, hemolysis, and limb ischemia was observed 
among Impella patients, though the sample was too small to 
evaluate the significance of these trends. The IMPRESS in 
Severe Shock (IMPella versus IABP Reduces mortality in 
STEMI patients treated with primary PCI in Severe cardiogenic 
SHOCK) trial was designed to compare all-cause mortality
between IABP and the Impella CP in AMICS but ended up 
being completed as an exploratory safety trial because of 
miscalculation of expected event rates19. A trend toward higher 
rates of bleeding and hemolysis was observed with the Impella 
CP, though the small sample size limited any conclusive 
findings. Finally, the IMPELLA-STIC trial compared IABP 
alone to IABP plus Impella 5.0 in 12 patients with AMICS 
and found a significantly higher rate of major bleeding in the 
combined device group, though the study was too small to 
evaluate the significance of other complication trends20. To 
date, only one randomized trial has evaluated the use of 
VA-ECMO in CS: the Extracorporeal Life Support in 
cardiogenic Shock complicating acute myocardial infarc￾tion (ECLS-SHOCK) trial randomized 42 post-arrest AMICS 
patients to VA-ECMO or no MCS and found similar rates 
of complications between groups, though again the study

was underpowered for clinical outcomes including safety 
conclusions21.
Given the paucity of sufficiently powered randomized trials, 
most data on complication rates come from observational 
case series and registries, which are summarized in Table 2. 
Despite inconsistent reporting and variability in outcome defi￾nitions, several trends are apparent from these data. First, 
higher rates of bleeding and vascular injury are associated with 
devices requiring larger bore access including Impella (13–14 
French access sheaths) and VA-ECMO (21–27 French venous 
cannulas plus 15–21 French arterial cannulas) compared 
to IABP (8–9 French access). Similarly, rates of stroke and 
limb ischemia are increased with Impella compared with 
IABP, and higher still with VA-ECMO. Two recent analyses

limb ischemia among AMICS patients treated with IABP, 
percutaneous VADs (Impella or TandemHeart), or VA-ECMO 
are exemplary of these trends. In this large sample, stroke was 
observed in 3.1% of patients with IABP, 5.6% of those with 
pVADs, and 9.7% of those treated with VA-ECMO. Simi￾larly, bleeding occurred in 19.4%, 29.9%, and 54.2% of each 
group, respectively, while limb ischemia occurred in 
0.9%, 3.6%, and 7.7%, respectively. All of these compli￾cations were associated with increased length of stay and 
hospitalization costs22,23. While it stands to reason that more 
invasive devices would lead to higher complication rates, it 
must be noted that these observational studies do not account 
for significant baseline differences between the real-world 
patients in whom the devices are deployed. Crude insight about 
the severity of shock across device cohorts can be gained by 
comparing the short-term mortality rates in Table 2. The 
lowest mortality is observed in patients treated with IABP 
(24%), which may be related to the selection of patients 
with “less-severe” CS who do not require high levels of 
hemodynamic support. In contrast, higher flow devices such 
as Impella may be chosen for patients with more severe CS, 
as reflected in a significantly higher mortality rate of 43.1%. 
Finally, as it is the only device capable of providing both cir￾culatory and respiratory support, VA-ECMO is often applied 
emergently for patients with cardiac arrest or severe CS, 
reflected in an extremely high observed mortality rate of 57.2%. 
Some of the observed disparity in complication rates across 
device cohorts may therefore be driven by baseline differences 
in illness severity, in addition to device factors. Accordingly, 
lower complication rates have been observed when these 
advanced devices have been applied in less-severely-ill cohorts. 
The recent STEMI-Door-to-Unload (STEMI-DTU) pilot 
trial tested the safety and feasibility of Impella CP use in 
50 patients with anterior STEMI, without CS. In this cohort 
with 4% overall mortality, complication rates were quite low: 
bleeding occurred in 14%, stroke in 2%, renal dysfunction in 4%, 
and hemolysis in 2%89. Two patients (4%) had major vascular 
events related to flow-limiting dissections of the femoral artery 
at device removal, with no device related mortality observed.
A final class of studies which have been used to compare 
relative complication rates between devices are compara￾tive observational analyses, which attempt to adjust for the 
significant baseline differences observed in cases series 
by attempting to match patients across available clinical 
variables. Three such studies have recently spurred substan￾tial debate about complications related to Impella use. Schrage 
et al. performed a matched analysis comparing 237 CS patients 
treated with Impella in 13 European centers to 237 matched 
patients taken from both arms (IABP and medical therapy) 
of the IABP-SHOCK II trial24. Amin et al. identified patients 
undergoing PCI with MCS (linked by same-day billing data), 
some of whom had CS, and performed a propensity matched 
analysis comparing those managed with Impella with those 
managed by IABP25. Finally, Dhruva et al. linked two reg￾istries to identify AMICS patients managed with Impella or 
IABP, matched for 75 baseline variables (though, notably, 
lactate and hemodynamic parameters were not available for 
matching)26. Each study reported a higher rate of complica￾tions associated with Impella compared to IABP. Even more 
striking, the Amin and Dhruva studies reported a significantly 
higher rate of in-hospital mortality in patients treated with 
Impella, raising the concern that the additional complications 
associated with Impella may translate to higher mortality. 
While these analyses corroborate the trends observed in obser￾vational case series as summarized in Table 2, their salience 
ultimately depends on the validity of their respective mor￾tality comparisons. As previously discussed, it is relatively 
obvious why larger sheath sizes would cause higher rates of 
bleeding and limb ischemia; whether morbidity from these com￾plications outweighs the benefits afforded by greater hemody￾namic support in patients with severe shock for whom an IABP 
would be inadequate remains unanswered. We argue that this 
question can be properly answered only through trials 
comparing CS patients randomized to different devices and 
powered for hard clinical endpoints. No amount of propen￾sity matching—particularly when the most well-validated 
prognostic variables in CS such as central venous pressure, 
lactate, and cardiac power output are missing—can account 
for the vast baseline differences between real-world patients 
being managed with these different devices. The ongoing 
DanGer shock trial and other trials may shed light on these 
critical questions27.
Moving forward without data
In the absence of high-quality randomized data clarifying the 
net risks and benefits of MCS platforms in CS, practition￾ers still need to move forward and manage individual patients 
with CS. Recognizing that there are likely higher rates of 
at least some complications (bleeding, limb ischemia, and 
hemolysis) with Impella and VA-ECMO compared to IABP, 
shock practitioners should redouble their efforts to adhere to 
the following best practices.
Rapid, coordinated multi-specialty evaluation of patients 
with suspected cardiogenic shock
Institutions should design structured responses (such as the 
‘Shock Team’) to ensure that patients with suspected CS are 
rapidly identified and evaluated by qualified practitioners so that 
necessary resources can be urgently made available and evalu￾ations begun regarding the likelihood of recovery or candidacy 
for durable MCS or transplant. Depending on the suspected
inciting insult and local staffing patterns, the shock team 
might include interventional cardiologists, heart failure spe￾cialists, (cardiac) intensivists, and cardiac/vascular surgeons 
along with perfusionists and critical care nurses. Some have 
suggested that the cath lab be used as a default staging ground 
where right heart catheterization, coronary angiography, and 
fluoroscopic MCS insertion can all be rapidly performed11.
Comprehensive invasive hemodynamic assessment to 
guide device selection and management
Critical to maximizing the risks and benefits of MCS is the use 
of objective hemodynamic assessment using pulmonary artery 
catheters (PACs) to guide device selection. Just as it is impor￾tant to identify the crashing patient with severe biventricular

congestion who is unlikely to stabilize with IABP alone, 
it is equally important to identify the STEMI patient with 
isolated left ventricular failure well-suited for left-sided Impella, 
sparing them the additional complications of a more invasive 
device like VA-ECMO. We and others have proposed algo￾rithms for device selection based on the ventricular congestive 
profile and validated indices of right ventricular function 
such as pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), along with 
the presence of concurrent respiratory failure10,12. Recent 
data suggest that algorithms incorporating hemodynami￾cally guided decision-making may lead to improved survival in 
AMICS (Figure 1), though observational studies directly exam￾ining associations between PAC use and clinical outcomes 
in CS have yielded mixed results11,28–31.
Fastidious prevention of and monitoring for the 
development of complications
Many complications can be avoided or their impact minimized 
if recognized and managed promptly. For example, a careful 
vascular assessment should be performed daily to monitor for 
signs of limb ischemia, which may require intervention such as 
external bypass or addition of a distal perfusion catheter. Simi￾larly, markers of hemolysis should be continually tracked 
to assess the need for device repositioning and thorough 
neurologic exams performed to identify signs of stroke, which 
can be particularly difficult to recognize in unconscious 
patients. In ECMO patients, right upper extremity oxygen 
saturation and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure should be 
continuously monitored for the development of Harlequin 
syndrome and left ventricular distension, which may require 
optimization of ventilator settings, upgrade to a VAV-ECMO 
configuration, or addition of a left ventricular vent9
. We 
would refer readers to a comprehensive review by Subrama￾niam and colleagues for further discussion of risk factors and 
strategies to reduce complications from acute MCS devices14.
Continuous re-assessment to guide device weaning or 
escalation
Aside from complications occurring at the time of device inser￾tion or removal, most occur as a function of time on support. 
Multimodal data (labs, hemodynamic parameters, echocardi￾ography) should be continuously re-integrated to assess for 
the possibility of device weaning or the need for escalation. 
Specific thresholds (cardiac power output <0.6, PAPi <0.9) 
have been proposed to guide consideration of escalation 
or addition of right-sided support, though specific device 
algorithms will depend on local availability30.
Implementation of best practices for device removal
Large bore access devices above 17Fr are commonly referred 
to vascular surgery for removal. However, with emerging 
techniques, devices ranging from 12Fr to 17Fr may be removed 
with percutaneous closure approaches. The Perclose device 
(Abbott Inc) can be used at the time of device implantation
(pre-closure approach) or at the time of device removal 
(post-closure approach) to rapidly achieve hemostasis. The 
Figure 1. Survival and studies in acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock. Two recent prospective registries employing a 
hemodynamically driven treatment algorithm have reported higher survival rates compared to several recent randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) that failed to use hemodynamic data to guide device selection or device management.

F1000Research 2020, 9(Faculty Rev):794 Last updated: 14 NOV 2024

Manta closure device (Teleflex Inc) has recently been introduced 
and may represent another approach for percutaneous vascular 
hemostasis. The introduction of the Impella CP with a side￾arm access port allows for device removal and post-closure, 
thereby mitigating vascular complication risk at the time of 
device removal32. Each operator must develop these technical 
skills to improve outcomes.
Conclusion
CS is a complex clinical syndrome that remains a major cause 
of global mortality and morbidity. MCS device utilization is 
growing for cardiogenic shock, though each MCS platform is 
associated with risks. High-quality randomized controlled trials
evaluating the use of MCS devices for CS are currently 
lacking but are in development. Recent reports utilizing admin￾istrative datasets and retrospective registries are of limited 
value other than to raise awareness that randomized controlled 
trials are needed to improve outcomes for patients. Progress 
in the field will be made only when high-quality rand￾omized trials are conducted in defined populations, powered 
for all-cause mortality. The decision to place an advanced 
device should be made by an experienced shock practitioner 
or team using the most complete information possible. In the 
meantime, clinicians should educate themselves about hemody￾namically driven decision-making algorithms and best practices 
to reduce complications associated with each MCS platform.
