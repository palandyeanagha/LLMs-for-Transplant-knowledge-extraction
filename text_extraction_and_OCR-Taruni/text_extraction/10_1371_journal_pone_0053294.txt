Abstract
Background: Fluid overload is frequently present in CAPD patients and one of important predictors of mortality. The aim of
this study is to investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors in a cohort study of Southern Chinese CAPD patients.
Methods: The patients (receiving CAPD 3 months and more) in our center were investigated from January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2009. Multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to assess the patient’s body composition
and fluid status.
Results: A total of 307 CAPD patients (43% male, mean age 47.8615.3 years) were enrolled, with a median duration of PD
14.6 (5.9–30.9) months. Fluid overload (defined by Extracellular water/Total body water (ECW/TBW)$0.40) was present in
205 (66.8%) patients. Univariate analysis indicated that ECW/TBW were inversely associated with body mass index (r = 20.11,
P = 0.047), subjective global assessment score (r = 20.11, P = 0.004), body fat mass (r = 20.15, P = 0.05), serum albumin
(r = 20.32, P,0.001), creatinine (r = 20.14, P = 0.02), potassium (r = 20.15, P = 0.02), and residual urine output (r = 20.14,
P = 0.01), positively associated with age (r = 0.27, P,0.001), Chalrlson Comorbidity Index score (r = 0.29, P,0.001), and
systolic blood pressure (r = 0.22, P,0.001). Multivariate linear regression showed that lower serum albumin (b = 20.223,
P,0.001), lower body fat mass (b = 20.166, P = 0.033), old age (b = 0.268, P,0.001), higher systolic blood pressure (b = 0.16,
P = 0.006), less residual urine output (b = 20.116, P = 0.042), and lower serum potassium (b = 20.126, P = 0.03) were
independently associated with higher ECW/TBW. After 1 year of follow-up, the cardiac event rate was significantly higher in
the patients with fluid overload (17.1% vs 6.9%, P = 0.023) than that of the normal hydrated patients.
Conclusions: The prevalence of fluid overload was high in CAPD patients. Fluid overload in CAPD patients were
independently associated with protein-energy wasting, old age, and decreased residual urine output. Furthermore, CAPD
patients with fluid overload had higher cardiac event rate than that of normal hydrated patents.

Introduction
Fluid overload is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis
[1], which is closely related to hypertension [2,3], cardiac
dysfunction [4,5], inflammation [6], and mortality in dialysis
patients [7,8]. In PD patients, measures of improving fluid status
include attempt by dialysis prescription to optimize sodium and
water removal, emphasis limits on sodium and water intake, and
administration diuretics to enhance residual urine output.
However, the crucial barrier to improve fluid management is the
limitation of indentifying early or occult overhydration, but not the
lack of strategies to enhance fluid removal [9].
Usually physicians estimate hydration status by clinical param￾eters, such as extremities edema, weight gain or increased blood
pressure [10], which provide a useful, but imprecise picture of fluid
status. Multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is
the most extensively studied technique to assess hydration in
patients. It involves measurements at a large number of
frequencies, with mathematical modeling of the data to estimate
ECW (theoretic resistance at a frequency of zero) and TBW
(theoretic resistance at infinite frequency), and ECW being the
marker of hydration [11]. Recent studies demonstrate it is of
potential value to provide precise and sensitive method for
detecting longitudinal changes in hydration [9,12,13].
Protein-energy wasting is a major negative prognostic factor in
dialysis patients, which may worsen patient outcome by aggravat￾ing existing inflammation, accelerating atherosclerosis and in￾creasing susceptibility to infection [14]. Although it was reported
that serum albumin, as a nutritional marker, correlated well with
multi frequency BIA parameters [15], whether protein-energy
wasting is the main contributor to fluid overload in PD patients

remains unclear. The present study attempted to assess the
prevalence and correlation factors of fluid overload in the southern
Chinese CAPD patients and investigate the relationship between
fluid overload and malnutrition.
Methods
Objectives
This was a cross-sectional, observational, single center study.
We hypothesized that protein-energy wasting was a main
contributor to fluid overload in PD patients. Thus the primary
aim of this study was to measure the hydration status in prevalent
CAPD patients and investigate the association of fluid status with
protein-energy wasting, also patient demographics, biochemical
markers, PD prescription, and medications.

The patients inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) undergoing
CAPD $3 month; (2) age .18 years; (3) signed informed consent
form. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with
pacemakers; (2) patients with amputation; (3) patients who were
not able to accomplish the analysis of body composition in

standing position for 3 minutes. Totally 585 patients were followed
up regularly at the clinic from Jan 1 2008 to Dec 31, 2009. 160
patients refused to participate in this study. 118 patients were
excluded from this study according to the exclusion criteria.
Finally 307 PD patients were recruited.
Ethics
The study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of
The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Informed
consent was obtained from each patient.
Investigations Undertaken
Patients were evaluated during a routine clinical visit, from
January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009.
Patients provided a 24-hour collection of urine and effluent,
completed on the morning of the study visit. Then the fluid was
analyzed for volume, urea, and creatinine content; Kt/V and
residual renal function (RRF) were calculated using PD Adequest
software (Baxter Healthcare, USA). D/Pcr was determined based
on results of the last available PET test preceding the BIA
measurement. Ultrafiltration and residual urine output were
calculated from the patient’s charts as a daily mean of
ultrafiltration and urine obtained during the last week preceding
the measurement. Solution glucose concentration (%) was
calculated by dividing the daily total amount of glucose in dialysis
solution by solution volume. At the same time, the data of patient
demographic information, PD prescription, medications were
collected.
Sitting blood pressure was measured using equipment that
meets certification criteria, and recorded as the mean of two
consecutive measurements with at least 2 minutes interval.
Blood was taken from patients to measure the following
biochemical markers: hsCRP, hemoglobin, creatinine, albumin,
transferrin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, serum phosphate, serum
calcium, intact-PTH, serum sodium, serum chloride, serum
potassium, carbon dioxide, serum glucose.
All the patients were regularly followed up and educated to
restrict salt intake of approximate 5 to 6 gram per day. Patient￾Figure 1. ROC analysis of edema for fluid overload

Bioimpedance Analysis
TBW, ECW, intracellular water (ICW), and body composition
was measured by multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance model
InBody 720 (Biospace, Seoul, Korea). InBody 720 uses state –of –
the-art technology, and 8-point tactile electrode system that
measures the total and segmental impedance and phase angle of
alternating electric current at six different frequencies (1 kHz,
5 kHz, 50 kHz, 250 kHz, 500 kHz, and 1000 kHz). Peritoneal
dialysis fluid was not drained from the abdomen as it has been
previously shown no significant effect on BIA measures [2,16,17].
Impedance measurements were made with the subject standing in
an upright position, on foot electrodes in the platform of the
instrument. The subject stood on the four foot electrodes: two oval
shape electrodes and two heel shape electrodes, and gripped the
two Palm-and Thumb electrodes in order to yield two thumb
electrodes and two palm electrodes, without shoes or excess
clothing. The skin and the electrodes were pre-cleaned using the
specific electrolyte tissue according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Prior to this, height was recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. All
the subjects were instructed to fast and to avoid exercise 8 h before
measurement and had been resting for at least 30 min before
measurement. All the body composition data were performed in
the instrument by inner software and typed in the result sheet
immediately after measuring. The software provides a plot of
reactive and resistive components of the measured impedance at
each frequency, as well as body weight, fat-free mass (FFM), TBW,
ICW, ECW, segmental fluid distribution, fat mass (FM), body cell
mass (BCM) and body mass index (BMI). This tool has been
assessed in normal populations, renal transplant patients, hemo￾dialysis patients, and PD patients, and closely correlates with the
gold standard measurement by isotope dilution [18,19,20,21,22].
In this study, the ratio of ECW/TBW $0.4 was used to define
overhydration, which was based on a fluid status measurement in
6520 normal healthy Koreans. The threshold of 0.4 represented
mean +2SD, i.e. .95th percentile for Asian normal people.
Measurement of Nutrition Status
Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) was performed by one
experienced dialysis nurse blinded to all clinical and biochemical
variables of the patients. The method is based on patient’s history
and physical examination as described by Detsky [23]. The history
focuses on gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea) and weight loss in the preceding 6 months. The
physical examination is graded by muscle wasting, loss of
subcutaneous fat and the presence of ankle edema. The nutritional
status was scored on the 7-point scale of the SGA. SGA scores of 5
or lower were defined as malnutrition.
Measurement of Comorbidity
The comorbidity score of each patient was determined
according to the Chalrlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The CCI
is one of the most commonly used comorbidity models which
based on comorbid conditions with varying assigned weights,
resulting in a composite score. The CCI was calculated by
assigning a weight of 2 to diabetes, stroke, renal insufficiency, and
malignancy, and a weight of 1 to the other comorbidities [24,25].
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined as myocardial in￾farction, angina, or history of congestive heart failure, cerebro￾vascular event, and peripheral vascular disease. Of all the patients,
10 patients had myocardial infarctions, 71 patients suffered from
congestive heart-failure, 56 patients had clinical signs of peripheral
atherothrombotic vascular disease and 23 patients suffered from
cerebrovascular disease. Seven patients had been diagnosed with
chronic lung disease, 3 had moderate or severe liver illness, 1 had
gastrointestinal ulcer, and 4 patients suffered from malignant
tumor.
Statistical Analyses
The patient’s characteristics were presented as mean 6 SD for
continuous variables, and percentages and frequencies for
categorical variables. The independent sample t-test was used for
normally distributed continuous variables between overhydrated
(ECW/TBW$0.4) and normal hydrated (ECW/TBW,0.4)
patients. A comparison of non-normally distributed continuous
variables was performed using Mann-Whitney U-test. For
categorical variables, the Chi-square test was used. The bivariate
correlation test was performed to examine the associations of
demographic and biochemical data with ECW, ECW/height, and
ECW/TBW. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used for
non-normally distributed variables and Pearson’s correlation
coefficients were used for normally distributed variables. Factors
that reached statistical significance were selected for further
multivariable analyses. As the ECW/TBW data was normally
distributed in this study, multiple linear regressions were
performed for multivariate analysis to explore the significant risk
factors of ECW/TBW. All calculation was performed with SPSS
13.0. P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results
Prevalence of Fluid Overload (Defined by ECW/
TBW$0.40) and Edema (by Physical Examination)
A total of 307 CAPD patients (43% male ) were enrolled, their
mean age was 47.8615.3 years old, with a median PD duration of
14.6 (5.9-30.9) months. Clinical, demographic and laboratory
characteristics of the 307 CAPD patients were shown in Table 1.
Fluid overload was present in 205 (66.8%) CAPD patients, while
edema (which was assessed by physical examination) was present
in 138 (138/307, 45%) CAPD patients (P,0.001). Of note, 88
(88/169, 52%) patients without edema was diagnosed as fluid
overload by BIA. While in the 138 CAPD patients who was
clinically diagnosed as edema, 26 (26/138, 19%) patients were not
fluid overload according to the BIA measurement (data not
shown).
Of the 278 non-studied patients, 66% were male, 18% diabetic
patients. Their mean age was 53. 2616.0 years old, with a median
PD duration of 1.73 (1.37-7.20) months. Compared with the non￾studied patients, the studied patients were younger, had obvious
lower male patients proportion, longer PD duration, and lower
residual urine volume (data not shown). While the proportion of
diabetic patients, and the proportion of patients with edema (46%
vs 44%) by physical examination was comparable in the studied
and non-studied patients.
Receiver – Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) Analysis
of Edema
As shown in Figure 1, we used ROC analysis to calculate the
sensitivity and specificity of edema (by physical examination) as
a diagnostic tool to diagnose fluid overload (defined by ECW/
TBW $0.40) in 307 CAPD patients (area under the concentration
curve, AUC = 0.653, sensitivity 0.562, specificity 0.745, P,0.001).
Characteristics of CAPD Patients with Fluid Overload
The clinical, demographic and laboratory characteristics were
compared between the CAPD patients with fluid overload and
patients without overhydration as shown in Table 1. Compared
with normal hydrated patients, patients with fluid overload were
older (50.4615.7 vs 42.7613.2 years, P,0.001), had higher
diabetic percentage (19% vs 9.8%, P = 0.039), higher malnour￾ished percentage (SGA score #5) (44% vs 29%, P = 0.018), higher
CVD percentage (81% vs 65%, P = 0.003), higher CCI score (4 vs
3, P = 0.02), and higher systolic blood pressure (140622 vs
132622 mmHg, P = 0.007), but had lower serum albumin level
(38 (35–41) vs 41 (38–43) g/L, P,0.001), lower serum potassium
(3.7 (3.3–4.1) vs 4.0 (3.4–4.4) mmol/L, P = 0.018 ), lower serum
creatinine (8686336 vs 10326362 mmol/L, P = 0.001). There was
no significant difference in the proportion of calcium channel
blockers using (70% vs 54%, P = 0.26) and diuretics using (6% vs
7%, P = 0.59) in both two groups of patients. All the patients in this
study used only one kind of loop diuretics (furosemide), and the
dosage of furosemide was not significantly different between the
two groups (80 (40, 120) vs 40 (20, 80), P = 0.062) (as shown in
Table 1).

Fluid Status in Different Subgroups of Patients
The ECW/TBW ratio of malnourished patients, CVD patients,
and diabetic patients was significantly higher than that of the
patients without malnutrition (0.40360.013 vs 0.39960.013,
P = 0.019), non CVD patients (0.40260.013 vs 0.39660.011,
P,0.001), and non diabetic patients (0.40660.012 vs
0.39960.013, P = 0.003), respectively, as shown in Figures 2, 3,
and 4.
Univariate Correlations for ECW/TBW in CAPD Patients
Univariate correlation analysis indicated that ECW/TBW were
inversely associated with BMI (r = 20.11, P = 0.047), SGA score
(r = 20.17, P = 0.004), body fat mass (r = 20.15, P = 0.05), serum
albumin (r = 20.32, P,0.001), serum creatinine (r = 20.14,
P = 0.02), serum potassium (r = 20.15, P = 0.02), and residual
urine output (r = 20.14, P = 0.01), but positively associated with
age (r = 0.27, P,0.001), CCI score (r = 0.29, P,0.001), solution
glucose concentration (r = 0.20, P,0.001), and systolic blood

pressure (r = 0.22, P,0.001), but not hs-CRP, ultrafiltration, KT/
V, D/Pcr, diuretic or anti-hypertension drugs using, as shown in
Table 2, Figures 5 and 6.
Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis for Predictors of
ECW/TBW in CAPD Patients
In multivariate linear regression, only old age (b = 0.268,
P,0.001), lower serum albumin (b = 20.223, P,0.001), lower
body fat mass (b= 20.166, P = 0.033), higher systolic blood
pressure (b= 0.16, P = 0.006), less residual urine output
(b = 20.116, P =0.042), and lower serum potassium
(b = 20.126, P = 0.03) were independently associated with higher
ECW/TBW (as shown in Table 3).
Clinical Outcome after One Year of Follow-up
After one year of follow-up, 16 (5.2%) patients died, 8 (2.6%)
patients transferred to hemodialysis, 22 (7.2%) patients received
kidney transplantation, 1 (0.3%) patient lost of follow-up. As
shown in the Table 4, the 1- year patient survival rate in the
normal hydrated patients is higher than that of the overhydrated
patients (98.0% vs 93.2%, Log Rank = 0.086), but not significant￾ly. Also, there was no significant difference of 1- year technique
survival rate between the two groups of patients (90.2% and
95.1%, Log Rank = 0.179). Nevertheless the cardiac event rate
was significantly higher (17.1% vs 6.9%, P = 0.023) in the patients
with fluid overload than that of the patients with normal
hydration. While no significant difference in the CVD mortality
was found between the two groups of patients (2.0% vs 4.4%, Log
Rank = 0.302). In addition, no difference was found in the
decrease of residual renal function in 1 year in the patients with
overhydration and that of the patients without overhydration (0.45
vs 0.26 ml/min?1.73 m2
, P = 0.603).
Seventy-nine patients had persistent overhydration, 187 patients
had intermittent overhydration, while 41 patients were maintained
euvolaemic over the 1 year follow-up period. There was no
significant difference in the decrease of residual renal function in
the patients who were persistently overhydrated and those that
were maintained euvolaemic over the follow-up period (0.75 vs
0.26 ml/min?1.73 m2
, P = 0.089).
Discussion
In the present study, the prevalence and risk factors of fluid
status were investigated in a cohort study of CAPD patients. We
found that the prevalence of fluid overload by bioimpedance
analysis in CAPD patients was 66.8%. Fluid overload in CAPD
patients were independently associated with protein-energy
wasting, old age, higher systolic blood pressure, hypokalemia,
and decreased residual urine volume, but not peritoneal transport
characteristics and inflammation.
In PD patients, practitioners rely most on routine physical
examination, observation of body weight, blood pressure, and fluid
output to diagnose fluid overload [10], which provide a useful, but
imprecise picture of fluid status. BIA is the most extensively
studied and most promising technique for routine monitoring of
fluid status and nutrition in dialysis patients [26,27,28,29,30]. The
present study showed the prevalence of fluid overload by
bioimpedance analysis in CAPD patients was 66.8% in this study,
which was notablely higher than the diagnosis rate of 45% by the
routine physical examination. Our results support BIA can be use
to indentify some clinical occult fluid overload patients before
notable clinical edema appear, which enables the appropriate
therapeutic changes. Of the 138 CAPD patients with clinical
edema, 26 (19%) patients were clinically diagnosed as edema, but
not in fluid overload status according to the BIA measurement.
Theoretically, under-evaluation of ECW/TBW may happen to
athletes, who have relatively more skeletal muscle cells, and less
extracellular water. Compared with the other 112 patients who
were diagnosed as both edema and fluid overload by BIA, these 26
patients were younger (44.7612.1 vs 51.7615.5, P = 0.033), had
lower proportion of DM (7.7% vs 25%, P = 0.054) and less CVD
history (58.3% vs 85.8%, P = 0.002). More importantly, they also
had significantly higher skeletal muscle mass (27.265.1 vs
24.765.8, P = 0.043), thus more intracellular water (22.463.9 vs
20.664.4, P = 0.06) and body protein mass (9.761.7 vs 8.961.9,
P = 0.056). Thus these data may explain the reason of the
underestimation of ECW/TBW in this group of patients.
We clearly demonstrated our hypothesis that a close relationship
existed between protein-energy wasting and overhydration in
a cohort of CAPD patients. As showed in the study, the
overhydrated patients had significantly higher malnourished
percentage, lower serum albumin and creatinine level than that
of the normal hydrated patients. Univariate analysis showed the
ECW/TBW ratio was inversely associated with BMI, SGA score,
body fat mass, serum albumin, and creatinine. Further multivar￾iate analysis confirmed that lower serum albumin and body fat
mass were independently associated with overhydration. As it is
well known that serum albumin, serum creatinine, BMI, body fat
mass, and SGA are good surrogate markers of protein-energy
wasting [31], a PD patient developing protein-energy malnutrition
may gradually acquire ECW accumulation to balance loss of body
cell mass or fat mass. Lower serum albumin level of malnourished
patients not only caused a reduced colloid osmotic pressure and
certainly aggravated the fluid retention in the tissue space, but also
was a consequence of hemodilution due to fluid overload.
Although worsening nutrition status may contribute to deteriorat￾ing fluid retention, whether improving nutritional status could help
to improve fluid overload in dialysis patients needs further
research.
Another interesting finding from this study was that decreased
residual urine volume, but not ultrafiltration, RRF, or overall
solute clearance (KT/V), play a possible pathogenic role in
volume overload independent of diuretic usage and other
confounders. Indeed, a close look at the reanalysis of the
CANUSA data reveals that it was not the additional solute
clearance obtained by renal function, but the urinary volume
excreted that was the driving force for the relative risk of death,
pointing to the fact that ‘‘volume status’’ is more important than
small solute clearance [32,33]. The similar finding was reported by
Ates et al [34], their finding suggests that removal of sodium and
fluid is a predictor of mortality in PD patients, whereas Kt/V and
total creatinine clearance are not risk factors. Our finding is

contradictory with the report from the European Body Compo￾sition Monitoring Study Cohort [2], which showed that neither
urinary output nor ultrafiltration contributed to the fluid balance.
The reason of this discrepancy is not clear. We speculate that these
different findings may relate to the high percentage of polyglucose
usage (63.7%) and automated PD (APD) modality (53.1%) in these
European group of patients, while only CAPD modality with
glucose solution was performed in our patients. Indeed, APD is
associated with lower sodium removal and may cause a more rapid
loss of residual renal function [35,36,37], both of which may lead
to an increase in extracellular fluid in these patients. However,
Davison SN et al. recently compared extracellular fluid volume
(ECFV) in patients who received CAPD and cycler-assisted
peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) with fewer night cycles and icodextrin
using for long daytime, no difference in the ratio of ECFV/TBW
was found in these two groups of patients [38].
Fluid overload contributes to the development of hypertension
in PD patients [2,3,39]. We also demonstrated a direct correlation
between systolic blood pressure and tissue hydration as other
authors reported [2]. It is well known that systolic blood pressure is
a high risk factor for CVD and CVD caused death. Our findings
also showed that the CAPD patients with overhydration had
higher CVD percentage than that in patients without over￾hydration, while the CAPD patients with CVD were more fluid
overloaded than the non CVD patients. Moreover, the over￾hydrated CAPD patients had a higher cardiac event rate and
tended to have a poor patient survival than that of the normal
hydrated CAPD patents in this study. The relationship among
overhydration, systolic blood pressure, and CVD as well as the role
of all these three factors in the pathogenesis of mortality need
further investigation in PD patients. On the other hand, a sub￾stantial proportion of patients did not follow this paradigm. Some
PD patients had a normal blood pressure despite being fluid
overloaded. These patients either suffer from congestive heart
failure, or had a lower total peripheral resistance [2,3,40]. Some
PD patients had uncontrolled hypertension despite normal tissue
hydration. It is postulated that they are probably patients suffered
from vascular stiffness or having a higher total peripheral
resistance [2,3]. Of note, thirty-two (10.4%) patients in our study
were over hydrated and normotensive but taking more than 2 anti￾hypertensive drugs. Compared with the other normotensive
patients, these 32 patients had a lower residual urine output (data
no shown, P = 0.044), and used higher glucose concentration
solution (P = 0.011), which suggested us to strengthen fluid
removal in these patients to achieve the aim of maintaining
normal blood pressure without useage of antihypertensive agents
[41].
Although Konings CJ et al demonstrated that fluid status was
related to peritoneal transport characteristics [42], we failed to
demonstrate this relationship in our study. This result is consistent
with Van Biese et al [2], who found a weak link between them,
and disappearing in the multivariate analysis. Nevertheless,
peritoneal transport status can help us understanding the
mechanism of ultrafiltration failure and choosing appropriated
management. After recognizing the high prevalence of fluid
overload and related factors in the CAPD patients, we suggest that
improving patient’s malnutrition, protecting residual renal func￾tion and increasing residual urine output may improve patient’s
fluid status. Actually, all the associations between fluid overload
and modifiable risk factors shown in our study may enhance
clinical opportunities to improve morbidity and mortality in
CAPD patients by identifying early overhydration and adopting
measures to improve fluid status. Moreover, our survey supported
that the BIA measurement could be used as a simple bedside
screening tool in clinical evaluation of fluid overload in CAPD
patients.
Limitation
The limitations of this report should also be noted. This is
a single center cross-sectional study, and the definition of fluid
overload comes from the BIA device manufacturer but lack of
Chinese healthy control data. Also, patients’ sodium intake
restriction was only educated by the staff but not calculated
accurately in this study. Further studies are needed to confirm the
causal factors of fluid overload and impact of fluid control guided
by BIA on residual renal function, nutrition, and cardiovascular
function in CAPD patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, fluid overload is common in CAPD patients.
Bioimpedance analysis monitoring can help to identify early and
occult fluid overload in CAPD patients. Fluid overload is
independently associated with the protein-energy wasting, old
age, higher systolic blood pressure, reduced residual urine volume,
and hypokalemia in CAPD patients. CAPD patients with fluid
overload have a higher cardiac event rate after 1 year and tend to
have poor 1- patient survival than that of the normal hydrated
CAPD patents. Further study is needed to evaluate whether
monitoring fluid balance can improve residual renal function,
nutrition and patient outcome.
