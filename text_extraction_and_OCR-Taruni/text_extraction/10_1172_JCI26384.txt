Searching for transcriptional regulators 
of Ang II–induced vascular pathology

Ang II plays a key role in cardiovascular regulation and participates in
vascular pathobiology, including inflammation and remodeling. Whether
these tissue effects are mediated by direct Ang II actions or indirectly as a
result ofits influence on hemodynamics is being debated.In vitro data have
shown that Ang II induces vascular cellular transcriptional activation and
gene expression, but the mechanisms explaining its long-term tissue effects
in vivo are relatively unknown. Do the multiple in vivo vascular activities
elicited by Ang II (such as inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular cell hyper￾trophy/proliferation) occur via independent pathways, or do common tran￾scription mechanisms mediate these multiple effects? In this issue, Zhan
et al. identify Ets-1 as a critical downstream transcriptional mediator of
vascular inflammation and remodeling in vivo; their data suggest that Ets-1
may be a common denominator of a complex process that involves multi￾ple pathways previously considered to be mechanistically independent (see
the related article beginning on page 2508). Characterization of the critical
transcription programs activated by Ang IIin vivo and determination ofthe
hierarchy of responses are vital to the understanding of the mechanism of
vascular disease and to the development of therapies targeted at inhibiting
the common transcription effectors of vascular pathology.
Inflammation and structural remodeling
are essential processes mediating vascular
responses to humoral and hemodynamic
stimuli and have been shown to be involved
in the mechanism of vascular disease. Over
the past several years, experimental and
clinical evidence has demonstrated a key
role of Ang II in these processes and that
blockade of the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS) inhibits vascular inflammation and
remodeling and reduces clinical vascu￾lar complications. However, an ongoing
debate exists with respect to the cardio￾vascular actions of Ang II and prompts the
following questions: (a) Does Ang II have
direct in vivo vascular actions indepen￾dent of its effects on blood pressure? (b)
How does Ang II exert its long-term effects
in tissue? and (c) Are the multiple Ang
II–induced vascular pathologic processes
(i.e., inflammation, fibrosis, and prolifera￾tion) mediated by common downstream
transcription factor(s)?
Certainly, it has been difficult to dis￾sect, in either in vivo or in vitro studies,
the direct effect of Ang II on tissue from
the indirect effects resulting from its
influence on hemodynamics. Clarifying
how the effects of Ang II are mediated will
be of great clinical relevance, particularly
with respect to the question of whether
drugs that block RAS (e.g., angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II
receptor blockers) will have any added
value beyond their traditional role as
blood pressure–lowering agents. Although
many in vitro studies have shown that
Ang II activates signal transduction path￾ways, transcriptional activation, and gene
expression, these studies have focused on
acute experimental conditions, and data
explaining the long-term cardiovascular
actions of Ang II are lacking. The mecha￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: KLF5, Krüppel-like

nisms responsible for Ang II activity, from
acute to chronic, especially with respect
to its effects on transcription regulation,
are relatively unknown.
In this context, the study by Zhan et al. in
thisissue of the JCI (1) providesinsight into
an important downstream transcription
mechanism mediating vascular inflamma￾tion and remodeling in response to chronic
Ang II infusion. The authors demonstrate
that Ets-1 is a critical mediator of vascular
remodeling and inflammation in response
to Ang II. They showthat vascular hyperpla￾sia, perivascular fibrosis, and cardiac hyper￾trophy are significantly diminished in Ets1–/–
mice comparedwithcontrolmice inresponse
to systemic administration of Ang II.
Importantly, these responses occurred
independently of any alterations in blood
pressure. Furthermore, the induction of 2
known targets of Ets-1, cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21 and plasminogen acti￾vator inhibitor–1, by Ang II was markedly
blunted in the aorta of Ets1–/– mice com￾pared with wild-type controls. Monocyte
chemoattractant protein–1, which had not
been previously linked to Ets-1 transcrip￾tional activation, was identified as a novel
target for Ets-1. Interestingly, the authors
also reported a significant reduction in
recruitment of T cells and macrophages to
the vesselwall,which supports a criticalrole
for Ets-1 as a transcriptional mediator of
vascular inflammation and remodeling in
response to Ang II.
Programs of transcriptional 
activation in response to Ang II
Ets-1 is the founder member of the Ets
family of transcription factors that spe￾cifically recognizes and activates DNA
response sequencesthat contain a GGAA/T
core in the promoters of target genes
(2). The DNA-binding activity of Ets-1 is
controlled by phosphorylation and asso￾ciation with other transcription factors.
Phosphorylation by ERK1/2 activates
Ets-1, whereas phosphorylation by Ca2+-

Mechanisms of Ang II–dependent activation of transcriptional programs that lead to changes in vascular function. Ang II activates several 
groups of transcriptional mechanisms that act in cooperation with Ets-1: (a) Ets-1 binding partners such as activator protein 1 (AP-1), 
STAT5, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), GATA, or activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), which are able to physically bind 
and regulate Ets-1 activity; (b) KLF5, which is activated in a position upstream of Ets-1; and (c) factors that have been shown to influence 
vascular function in an Ets-1–independent or –cooperative fashion. The sequence of events that leads to the long-term changes in Ets-1 
activation and vascular function in response to Ang II is still undefined. MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein–1; PAI-1, plasminogen 
activator inhibitor–1; uPA, urokinase type plasminogen activator.

calmodulin kinase II or myosin light
chain kinase inhibits Ets-1 DNA-bind￾ing activity. A number of transcription
factors have been shown to regulate the
transcriptional activity of Ets-1 by modu￾lating Ets-1 DNA-binding affinity, such as
acute myeloid leukemia–1, pituitary-spe￾cific transacting factor 1, hypoxia-induc￾ible factor 2α, and Pax5 (3). In addition,
the interaction of Ets-1 with GATA3,
activating transcription factor 2, NF-κB,
and Stat5 cooperatively activates target
promoters. Ets-1 increases the transcrip￾tional activation of immediate-early gene
promoters including a number of genes
involved in VSMC growth and prolifera￾tion, endothelial activation, and the vas￾cular inflammatory response. Ets-1 also
induces the expression of MMP-1, -3, and
-9 and urokinase type plasminogen acti￾vator; these proteases are known to be
involved in extracellular matrix degrada￾tion and atherosclerosis progression (4, 5).
Ets-1 activation therefore represents a
final effector of multiple signaling path￾ways and components of protein complex￾es on immediate-early promoters. Indeed,
the data reported by Zhan et al. (1) show
that Ets-1 is a downstream transcriptional
mediator of Ang II–regulated expression
of genes involved in the processes of vas￾cular inflammation and remodeling.
Multiple signaling mechanisms poten￾tially link Ang II to Ets-1–dependent tran￾scription (Figure 1). Ang II activates the
Ras-MAPK pathway, which in turn induc￾es both the expression and phosphoryla￾tion of Ets-1, leading to expression of a
number of genes involved in vascular
responses. Besides the important role of
Ets-1 as an effector of Ang II responses,
several other mechanisms of transcrip￾tional control involving nuclear factor
of activated T cells, PI3K, AKT, RhoA,
or myocardin, acting in concert with or
independently of Ets-1, have begun to be
characterized (6–8). For example, Ang II
induces the binding of serum response
factor (SRF) to the specific smooth and
cardiac muscle coactivator myocardin;
furthermore, the homeodomain protein
Prx1 strongly promotes SRF binding to
its specific response element after Ang II
stimulation. Thus, what has emerged is
a multiple-signal transduction system
that defines expression of immediate￾early genes (via SRF-Ets factors) or tis￾sue-restricted genes (via SRF-myocardin),
acting through a combinatorial mecha￾nism of protein-protein interactions in
response to Ang II. The observation by
Zhan et al. (1) of a decrease in vascular
remodeling and inflammation in Ets-1–
KO animals in response to Ang II implies
that this transcription factor is a criti￾cal regulator of multiple pathways that
are active in different tissues and, more
importantly, identifies Ets-1 as a common
denominator of pathways previously con￾sidered mechanistically independent.
The fact that a network of transcription
factors and effector proteins participate in
the control of Ang II–dependent vascular
remodeling and inflammation raises the
question of how these proteins interact
with each other and how they coordinate
their activities to generate and maintain
a specific vascular phenotype. Despite
many in vitro observations linking Ang II
to a multitude of effectorsin VSMCgrowth
and differentiation, there are few reports
examining the specific role of these mol￾ecules with respect to the in vivo chronic
effects of Ang II on the cardiovascular sys￾tem. Studies in KO mice lacking expres￾sion of bradykinin receptor type 2, p66-
Shc, PI3Kγ, or Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)
have shown that these effectors are critical
for vascular responses to Ang II (9–11).
However, the hierarchy of responses of
these mediators and the place of action of
transcription factors such as Ets-1 after
the initial Ang II stimulus are unknown.
The demonstration by Zhan et al. (1)
that Ang II–dependent KLF5 activation
occurs upstream of Ets-1 in vivo suggests
that Ets-1 is a critical downstream regu￾lator of a complex process that involves a
multitude of effectors. The availability of
specific KO animals will make it feasible
to conduct epistasis analysis to establish
the proper order of action of these impor￾tant factors in Ang II–dependent vascular
responses. Furthermore, given its critical
role in transcriptional regulation, Ets-1
may be an important therapeutic target
for the inhibition of vascular disease.
Ang II–dependent gene expression: 
key unanswered questions
Despite considerable progress overthe past
several years in defining the mechanisms
of Ang II–dependent gene expression, sig￾nificant gaps exist in our understanding of
the means by which the cellular machin￾ery controls the short- and long-term
responses to Ang II at the transcriptional
level. These responses include both the
pathways activated by cellular receptors
and activation of general intracellular sig￾naling pathways following receptor activa￾tion. This raises the question of how the
cellular machinery dictates the response
from an acute signal pathway to long￾term gene expression. In this regard, it has
become evident in recent years that after
the initial steps of ligand activation and
desensitization, the Ang II receptor is still
able to transduce intracellular signals due
to the scaffold nature of β-arrestins bound
to the receptor (12). Furthermore, after
the initial stimulation, Ang II must induce
genetic reprogramming in order to have a
sustained effect on VSMC growth, which
would therefore provide a link between
the acute and chronic outcomes of Ang II
actions. This reprogramming should set
the subsequent level of local biochemical
activities, even in the absence of receptor
activation, which can have a long-term
influence on the phenotype. The molecu￾lar nature of this genetic reprogramming
and the determination of the existence of a
masterregulator are key to the understand￾ing of chronic Ang II effects in tissues.
This knowledge will be critical to our
understanding of the physiological and
pathological roles of Ang II–dependent
gene expression, which may then be applied
in the treatment of human disease. The
use of a comprehensive systems biology
approach, including functional proteomics
and high-throughput genomic techniques,
to characterize the genetic program of vas￾cular remodeling will help us better under￾stand the complexity of Ang II–dependent
gene expression in biological systems.

Osteoblast-derived PTHrP is a physiological 
regulator of bone formation
T. John Martin
St. Vincent’s Institute of Medical Research and Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
Parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) acts as a paracrine regulator
in severaltissues, and its physiological roles also extend to bone.In this issue
of the JCI, Miao et al. demonstrate that osteoblast-specific ablation of Pthrp
in mice results in osteoporosis and impaired bone formation both in vivo
and ex vivo (see the related article beginning on page 2402). These mice reca￾pitulate the phenotype of mice with haploinsufficiency of Pthrp.The findings
demonstrate that PTHrP plays a central role in the physiological regulation
of bone formation, by promoting recruitment and survival of osteoblasts,
and probably plays a role in the physiological regulation of bone resorp￾tion, by enhancing osteoclast formation. This has implications for both our
understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and its treatment.
Multiple sites of PTHrP 
production and action
Parathyroid hormone–related protein
(PTHrP) resembles parathyroid hormone
(PTH) in its aminoterminal sequence (1),
and the two have very similar structural
requirements for binding and activation of
their common receptor, type 1 PTH recep￾tor(PTHR1) (2). Although PTHrP circulates
as a hormone that causes hypercalcemia in
patients with certain cancers, it has no nor￾mal hormonalrole exceptin the fetus,where
it promotes the transfer of calcium across
the placenta from mother to fetus, and dur￾ing late pregnancy and lactation, in which
its function is still not fully defined (3, 4).
Largely as a result of genetics-based stud￾ies, we now realize that PTHrP should not
be regarded as a hormone at all in its nor￾malrole. The physiologicalrole of PTHrP in
postnatal mammals appears to relate to its
function as a paracrine effector. PTHrP pro￾tein and mRNA are bothwidely expressed in
human tissues (3, 5), often playing impor￾tant roles during both development and
adulthood. Much of our understanding of
the role of PTHrP has come from the analy￾sis of genetically manipulated mice. For
example, PTHrP has been shown to regulate
epithelial-mesenchymal signaling during
the development of mammary glands and
hair follicles, as well as the relaxation of
uterine and vascularsmooth muscle (4). The
factthat PTHrP mRNA is unstable, and that
the protein itself is liable to extensive pro￾teolytic processing, ideally equips PTHrP to
function as a cytokine. The status of PTHrP
as a paracrine or autocrine factor has been
the subject ofseveral reviews(3–6).
PTHrP in bone
The discovery of PTHrP production in
bone (7, 8) pointed to possible local func￾tions of this peptide, and ablation of either
Pthrp or Pthr1 in mice revealed a role for
PTHrP in endochondral bone formation
(9, 10). Targeted disruption of these genes
in mice resulted in grossskeletal abnormal￾ities consistent with chondrodysplasia, and
death in the perinatal period (9, 10). PTHrP
mRNA and protein were shown to be pro￾duced also in intramembranous bone, by
cells at even the earliest mesenchymalstage
of development (11). Other in vitro and in
vivo observations indicated that PTHrP
and PTHR1 were expressed by different cell
populations. Cells of mesenchymal lineage
that differentiate into osteoblasts were
shown to produce PTHrP very early during
differentiation, and PTHrP levels decreased
with further cell maturation. PTHR1 is
expressed at a laterstage in differentiation,
by committed preosteoblasts (7, 8).
PTH, the hormone; PTHrP, 
the bone cytokine
Some years ago Amizuka et al. showed
that although Pthrp–/– mice died at the
time of birth because of a cartilage defect,
Pthrp+/– mice survived. By 3 months of
age the haplotype-insufficient mice were
markedly osteoporotic and possessed an
increased number of adipocytes in their
bone marrow (9). These observations gave
much impetus to the view that PTHrP is a
local factor ofsome importance in bone. In
order to determine the relative contribu￾tions to bone physiology of the endocrine
factor PTH and the paracrine factor PTHrP,
Miao et al. recently examined mice ren￾dered null for Pth and found that they had
increased trabecular bone volume because
