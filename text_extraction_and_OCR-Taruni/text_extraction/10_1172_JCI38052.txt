HIV infection results in CD4+ T cell deficiency, but efficient combination antiretroviral therapy (c-ART)
restores T cells and decreases morbidity and mortality. However, immune restoration by c-ART remains vari￾able, and prolonged T cell deficiency remains in a substantial proportion of patients. In a prospective open￾label phase I/IIa trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of administration of the T cell regulator IL-7. The
trial included 13 c-ART–treated HIV-infected patients whoseCD4+ cell counts were between 100 and 400 cells/μl
and plasma HIV RNA levels were less than 50 copies/ml. Patients received a total of 8 subcutaneous injections
of 2 different doses of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7; 3 or 10 μg/kg) 3 times per week over a 16-day period.
rhIL-7 was welltolerated and induced a sustained increase of naive and central memory CD4+ andCD8+ T cells.
In the highest dose group, 4 patients experienced transient increases in viral replication. However, functional
assays showed thatthe expanded T cells responded to HIV antigen by producing IFN-γ and/or IL-2.In conclu￾sion, in lymphopenic HIV-infected patients, rhIL-7 therapy induced substantial functional and quantitative
changes in T cells for 48 weeks. Therefore, patients may benefit from intermittent therapy with IL-7 in com￾bination with c-ART.
Introduction
Infection with HIV is characterized by chronic T cell depletion
and increased risk of illness and opportunistic infection. Effec￾tive treatment of HIV infection with combination antiretroviral
therapy (c-ART) suppresses viral replication, leading to recovery
of CD4+ T cells in the majority of individuals (1). This leads to a
significant improvement in immune functions and to a dramat￾ic reduction in the incidence of both HIV-related mortality and
AIDS-defining events (2, 3). Nevertheless, long-term suppressive
c-ART remains associated with a persistent qualitative defect of
immune function and does not result in normalization of CD4+
T cell countsin a substantial proportion ofindividuals(4–6). There
is considerable variability among individualsin the extent of CD4+
T cell reconstitution, ranging from those who achieve normal lev￾els of CD4+ cells to those whose T cell counts remain persistently
low (7). Moreover, despite successful therapy, recent studies show
that life expectancy of these HIV-infected patients is still shorter
than that of HIV-negative age- and gender-matched controls (8).
Death amongst these patients is now increasingly attributed to
non-AIDS conditions typical of aging, including cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and end-stage liver and renal diseases, which occur
at an excessive rate in HIV-infected patients compared with the
general population (9–12).
In addition to traditional risk factors, several factors, such as
uncontrolled virological replication and chronic immune activa￾tion, could cause these serious non-AIDS events. Recent cohort
studies show that the level of immune competence may be highly
relevant to the pathogenesis of these conditions, even in patients
who have undetectable viral load (5, 11). Time spent at a lower
CD4+ T cell count, or a poor initial recovery of CD4+ T cells, after
initiation of c-ART contributesto greater morbidity and mortality
(9, 10, 12–14). The ability of c-ART alone to restore immunocom￾petence and mitigate the underlying harmful aspects of chronic
immune activation appears incomplete (15, 16). Therefore, devel￾opment of complementary approaches able to compensate for the
limitations of c-ART would be of interest.
The immune system is subjected to homeostatic regulation that
ensures maintenance of a more or less constant total number of
lymphocytes in the periphery. This is achieved through complex
cellular interactions that control cell proliferation, differentiation,
and death through numerous cytokines and interactions with the
environment (17). This equilibrium is severely compromised in
situations characterized by profound acute or chronic T cell deple￾tion, such as immunosuppressive treatments, irradiation, or HIV
infection (18). In these situations, T cell numbers will return to
normal valuesthrough thymic-independent antigen-driven periph￾eral expansion and/or the generation of lymphocytes from hema￾topoietic stem/progenitor cells. A therapeutic approach aimed at
accelerating the recovery of the human T cell compartment and at
improving the effectiveness of the immune system could represent
an efficient immune-based therapy for lymphopenic conditions.
IL-7 is a cytokine playing an important role in T cell homeo￾stasis (19) and is essential for T cell development in mice and

humans (20–23). IL-7 modulates thymic output and mediates
the expansion and survival of naive and memory T cells (20, 21,
23–25). IL-7 also inhibits the apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
from HIV-infected patients in vitro (26). These findings provide a
rationale for considering IL-7 as an agent for immune reconstitu￾tion in HIV infection (27).
We report here findings of a prospective multicenter open-label
phase I/IIa study designed specifically to assess the safety and
immunological effects of repeated administration of recombinant
human IL-7 (rhIL-7) therapy in chronically HIV-infected subjects
with persistently low CD4+ T cell counts despite virologic suppres￾sion under c-ART. We showed that IL-7 administration was well
tolerated and induced a significant, dose-dependent increase of
naive and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In vitro assays
showed thatthese cells were functional and responded to HIV anti￾gen by producing cytokines.
Results
Study design and participants. We screened 17 patients and included
14 in this prospective open-label multicenter study of rhIL-7 ther￾apy. Eligible patients had a CD4+ T cell count of 100–400 cells/μl
and plasma HIV RNA levelslessthan 50 copies/ml for atleast 6 mo
while receiving a combination of antiretroviral drugs for at least
12 mo. Patients received s.c. injections of rhIL-7 (see Methods)
every other day for a total of 8 doses over 16 d. Visitsforsafety and
immunological efficacy were made at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d and
12 wk. An extended follow-up period lasted until 48 wk.
We enrolled 6 patients at the 3-μg/kg dose and 8 patients at the
10-μg/kg dose. The baseline characteristics of patients are listed
in Table 1. At the 3-μg/kg dose, all patients received 8 injections.
At the 10-μg/kg dose, 6 patients received 8 injections, 1 patient
received 7 injections because of a dose-limiting toxicity event after
the seventh injection, and 1 patient received only 1 injection. The
sum of the dosesinjected per patient was 24 μg/kg for the 3-μg/kg
dose and 80 μg/kg for the 10-μg/kg dose. All patients completed
12 wk of follow-up as well as the 48-wk extended follow-up.
rhIL-7 therapy induces a significant increase of T cells in a dose-dependent 
manner. The impact of IL-7 administration on the absolute CD4+
and CD8+ counts is shown in Figure 1A and Table 2. The median
absolute CD4+ T cell count within
the last 6 mo (3 time points) prior
to the study entry was 214 and 265
cells/μl for the 3- and 10-μg/kg
dose, respectively (Table 1). The
median absolute CD4+ T cell count
at baseline (equal to the combined
value at screening and 0 d) was
217 cells/μl for the 3-μg/kg dose
and 239 cells/μl for the 10-μg/kg
dose, confirming the defect in the
quantitative immune reconstitu￾tion. At 28 d, absolute CD3+, CD4+,
and CD8+ T cell counts increased
dramatically in all patients (Figure
1A). Patients receiving the 3-μg/kg
dose experienced a median gain of
118 CD4+ T cells/μl (68% increase;
interquartile range [IQR], 88 to
215 cells/μl; P = 0.03, Wilcoxon
test), and patients receiving the
10-μg/kg dose showed a median gain of 576 CD4+ T cells/μl (212%
increase; IQR, 442 to 695 cells/μl; P = 0.02, Wilcoxon test). At the
same time points, the median increase in CD8+ T cell counts was
282 cells/μl for the 3-μg/kg dose (45% increase; IQR, 379 to 1,097
cells/μl; P = 0.03) and 996 cells/μl for the 10-μg/kg dose (206%
increase; IQR, 1,059 to 2,107 cells/μl; P = 0.02). We also evaluated
the kinetics of CD4+ T cell increases. At 7 d, patients receiving the
3- and 10-μg/kg doses experienced a median increase of 92 CD4+
T cells/μl (50% increase) and 471 CD4+ T cells/μl (170% increase),
respectively. CD4+ T cell counts peaked at 21 d in both treatment
groups and reached a median of 458 cells/ml (109% increase) at
3 μg/kg and 911 cells/ml(308%increase) at 10 μg/kg.Consequently,
the time to reach a CD4+ cell count of up to 500 cells/μl after the
first administration of IL-7 was within a median of 21 and 7 d in
patients receiving doses of 3 and 10 μg/kg, respectively. Finally,
the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell gain at 12 wk was strongly cor￾related with CD4+ T cell counts at baseline (Spearman r2, 0.432;
P = 0.01; Figure 2).
A slight decrease of circulating mature B cellswas noted at 14 d in
patients from both dose levels (Figure 1B and Table 2). No increase
of pro-B CD34+CD19+ B cells was noted in the periphery regardless
of the dose of rhIL-7 administered (Figure 1B and Table 2). A sub￾stantial percentage of mature B cells expressed CD10 antigen (Fig￾ure 1B), a recently described phenotype of transitional B cells (28).
No significant changes in CD3–CD56+ NK cell counts were noted
throughoutthe study in patientstreatedwith the 3-μg/kg dose, but
a significant increase at 14 d (additional 58 cells/μl) that persisted
at 28 dwas observed in subjectstreatedwith the 10-μg/kg dose (Fig￾ure 1C and Table 2). In addition, a persistent increase of NKT cells
(CD3+CD56+) was also noted in these same patients (additional 71
cells/μl at 14 d; Figure 1C and Table 2). These results showed that
in HIV-infected patients, rhIL-7 therapy preferentially increasesthe
number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cellsin a dose-dependent manner.
Sustained effects of rhIL-7 therapy on lymphocyte cell counts.Beyond28d,
all patients were included in the long-term survey of this study.
Although CD4+ T cells slightly decreased beyond 28 d, cell counts
remained significantly higher than baseline values. Median CD4+
T cell counts in patients from the 3 μg/kg dose were 329 cells/μl
at 12 wk (range, 177 to 358 cells/μl; 54% increase over baseline),

baseline), and 282 cells/μl at 48 wk (range, 152 to 346 cells/μl;
28% increase over baseline; P < 0.0001, Friedman test). In patients
given the 10-μg/kg dose, median CD4+ T cell counts were 575
cells/μl at 12 wk (range, 237 to 804 cells/μl; 130% increase over
baseline), 525 cells/μl at 24 wk (range, 230 to 696 cells/μl; 95%
increase over baseline), and 403 cells/μl at 48 wk (range, 213
to 654 cells/μl; 75% increase over baseline; P < 0.0001, Fried￾man test). Similarly, and as shown in Figure 1A, CD8+ T cell
counts also remained significantly higher than baseline values
throughout the study. By 12, 24, and 48 wk, median percentages
of CD8+ T cell counts were still 121%, 55%, and 58% above base￾line, respectively, in patients given the 10-μg/kg dose (P < 0.0001,
Friedman test). These results showed that the immunological
effects of rhIL-7 were sustained and that total CD4+ and CD8+
T cell counts remained elevated for up to 45 wk after discontinu￾ation of rhIL-7 administration.
Naive and central memory T cell populations are preferentially increased 
by rhIL-7 therapy. We investigated the effects of rhIL-7 therapy on
the differentsubsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using CD45RA with
CD27 and CD28 markersfor the definition of naive, central mem￾ory, effector memory, effector, and terminally differentiated effec￾tor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (see Methods). As shown in Figure 3
and Table 2, at 28 d, rhIL-7 therapy administered at the 3-μg/kg
dose preferentially expanded naive and central memory CD4+
T cells (P = 0.03 versus baseline for both comparisons). Changes
in naive, central memory, and effector memory cells were signifi￾cantly different in patients treated with 10 μg/kg rhIL-7 and had
already achieved significance at 14 d (P < 0.03 versus baseline for
all comparisons). At 28 d, mean absolute countsincreased from 45
to 183 cells/μl in the naive subset, from 126 to 422 cells/μl in the
central memory subset, and from 51 to 166 cells/μl in the effector
memory subset. In addition, these changes remained significant
at 12 wk (P = 0.03). As noted for patients treated with the lower

dose of rhIL-7, no changes in effector and terminally CD45RA+
effector subsets were observed. The naive CD4+ T cell population
expressing a high level of CD31 antigen was described as recent
thymic emigrants (RTEs) and was enriched in T cell receptor exci￾sion circle (TREC) content (29). Therefore, we analyzed this popu￾lation by gating CD31hi-expressing CD4+ T cells within the naive
CD45RA+CD27+ subset. Low and high doses of rhIL-7 therapy led
to a significant, but transient, dose-dependent increase of these
cell populations at 28 d (Figure 3).
Effects of rhIL-7 on CD8+ T cellsubsets were significantly differ￾ent from those observed in the CD4+ T cells. Only the high dose
of rhIL-7 led to a significant increase in mean absolute counts of
naive and central memory cells: from 113 and 209 cells/μl at base￾line to 703 and 592 cells/μl at 14 d and 681 and 572 cells/μl at 28 d
(P = 0.02 for all comparisons). These changes were sustained at 12
wk (P = 0.02). No effects were noted within the effector memory,
effector, and terminally CD45RA+ effector cells. These results
showed that rhIL-7 induces a significant and preferential increase
of naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Effects of rhIL-7 therapy on cell cycling and immune activation. When
rhIL-7 is administered repeatedly, it is critical to investigate the
dynamics ofIL-7 receptor α chain (IL-7Rα) expression on expanded
Tcells.Therefore,we estimated the changesin circulatingTcellsthat
express IL-7Rα (CD127) throughout the study. In patients treated
with 10 μg/kg rhIL-7,we found a 4-fold increase of circulatingCD4+
and CD8+ T cellsthat express CD127 at 14 and 28 d (P < 0.01 versus
baseline for both comparisons) that persisted until 12 wk (2-fold
that of baseline, P = 0.002; Figure 1D). These results indicated that
the increase of T cells is associated with a persistent expression of
the receptor. This correlates with previous observations in preclini￾cal models (30) and in cancer patients (31), indicating that rhIL-7
augments T cell cycling. To evaluate the effects of rhIL-7 in HIV￾infected patients, we quantified Ki67 expression in total circulating
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. At baseline, a median of 1.3% CD4+ T cells
expressed Ki67 in patientsfrom the 2 dose levels. A dose-dependent
increase in the frequency of cycling CD4+ cells was seen within 14 d
of rhIL-7 administration, with approximately 4.1% of CD4+ T cells
expressing Ki67 in subjects treated at the 10-μg/kg dose (P = 0.03;
Figure 4A and Table 2). Analysis of Ki67 expression in differentsub￾populations of CD4+ cells showed an increase of cycling cells in all
subsets (P < 0.05 versus baseline) except terminally differentiated
effector cells (data not shown). Moreover, the frequency of cycling
CD8+ cellsincreased significantly in patientstreatedwith the 10-μg/
kg dose (Figure 4B and Table 2). After cessation of rhIL-7 therapy,
although CD4+ and CD8+ T cell countsremained higher than base￾line values at 28 d and 12 wk, the frequency of cycling CD4+ and

CD8+ T cells declined and returned to baseline levels,which suggests
that rhIL-7 might affect T cellsurvival.
Because residual immune activation persists in HIV-infected
patients despite control of viral load under c-ART, it is critical to
evaluate the effect of IL-7 on T cell activation markers. At baseline,
in patients administered the 10-μg/kg dose, the mean percentage
of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing CD38 and HLA-DR was 3.4%
(SD, 1.2%) and 5% (SD, 2.7%), respectively. These percentages did
not change significantly, either at 14 d (CD4+, 3.6%; CD8+, 6.3%) or
at 28 d (CD4+, 3.7%; CD8+, 6.8%; Figure 4C and Table 2).

with a preserved functional capacity of T cells, we evaluated their
capacity to proliferate and to produce cytokines after in vitro
stimulation. As shown in Figure 5A, in response to TCR simula￾tion using anti-CD3 antibodies, the proliferative capacity of T cells
from patientsin both groupsremained unchanged at the different
time points. Interestingly, the median frequency of CD4+ T cells
producing IL-2 after staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) stimula￾tion tended to increase, without reaching statistical significance,
from 5.7% at entry to 8.1% at 28 d and 8% at 12 wk, while no sig￾nificant changes were noted for IFN-γ–producing CD4+ T cells
(Figure 5B). As expected, the frequency of CD8+ T cells producing
IL-2 was low in these patients; however, a significant increase was
observed, from 0.45% at entry to 1.5% at 28 d and 0.9% at 12 wk
(P = 0.005, Wilcoxon test; Figure 5B).
Recent studies in a mouse model have shown that IL-7 admin￾istration may augment the accumulation of functional viral￾specific memory T cells (32, 33). Looking at the data from 7
patients in the 10-μg/kg dose group, we evaluated the functional
capacity of CD4+ T cells to produce IL-2 and IFN-γ after stimula￾tion with CMV and HIV antigens in vitro. A significant increase
in the median frequency of CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ
and/or IL-2 was noted in 4 subjects (Figure 5C). Interestingly,
in 3 of these cases, this rise in HIV-specific CD4+ T cells was
associated with transient “blips” in HIV replication (see below).
Thus, the functional capacity of T cells in patients treated with
IL-7 was at least preserved or remained greater than baseline
values. Regarding the dramatic effect of IL-7 on total CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell counts, generally these results suggest that admin￾istration of IL-7 leads to an increase in the frequency of func￾tional T cells in these patients.

in liver function enzymes, no grade 3 or 4 clinical or laboratory
abnormalities were noted. In the patient with a grade 3 rise in liver
function enzymes, liver function testing showed chronic fluctua￾tion above normal values, likely the result of histological meta￾bolic liver steatosis diagnosed 4 years prior to study entry. During
the treatment of this patient, levels of alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) increased gradually from the 14-d time point, leading to
omission of the eighth injection of IL-7. Levels of ALT and aspar￾tate aminotransferase (AST) reached 9.8- and 6.5-fold normal val￾ues at 23 d and returned to baseline values within 20 d of IL-7
discontinuation. No symptoms, clinical signs, or other laboratory
abnormalities were noted. For both patient groups, no significant
changesin granulocytes,red blood cells, or platelets were observed
throughout the study. Lymphoid organ examination and moni￾toring of plasma and cellular EBV DNA viral load did not show
substantial abnormality (data not shown), providing reassurance
regarding the potentialrisk of lymphoproliferative disorderin this
population treated with IL-7. Monitoring of plasma concentration
of rhIL-7 showed that maximum plasma concentration values
were 101 and 447 pg/ml after administration with 3 and 10 μg/kg
rhIL-7, respectively. Similarly, AUC values correlated well with the
dose administered (data notshown), and no neutralizing anti–IL-7
antibodies were detected.
Effects of rhIL-7 therapy on plasma HIV RNA and cellular DNA values.
HIV plasma RNA values were monitored throughout the study. No
increase of viral load was noted in patients from the 3-μg/kg group
(Table 3). In contrast, 4 of 8 patients in the 10-μg/kg group experi￾enced a transient elevation of plasma HIV mRNA values. No modi￾fications of antiretroviralregimen or compliance issueswith antiret￾roviral drugs were reported in these patients. Recentin vitro studies
have shown that IL-7 may increase HIV infectivity of CD4+ T cells
(34–36). With thisin mind,we evaluated the cellular content of viral
DNA at entry, at 21 d, and at 12 wk. We did not find any significant
changes in HIV DNA log10 copies per 106 PBMCs (Table 4). Since
IL-7 led to a significant increase in CD4+ T cells, it was important
to calculate the content of viral DNA per 106 CD4+ T cells. No sig￾nificant changes in these values were noted throughout the study.
These results show that IL-7 did not directly affect the cellular HIV
DNA content, although a possible transient effect on HIV replica￾tion could be detected in patientstreated with the higher dose.
Discussion
Although viral load control in HIV-infected patients is an attain￾able goal with the current potent c-ART regimen, the magnitude
of CD4+ cell restoration among patients remains variable (4–7).
Immune restoration is predicted by several imprinted factors,
some of which — such as age, genetic background, history of infec￾tion, and nadir of CD4+ cells — are beyond the reach of therapeu￾tic intervention (37–43). Nevertheless, the length of time patients
spend with low CD4+ T cell counts is clearly associated with a
higher morbidity in HIV-infected patients(9, 10, 12–14). Thissug￾gests that a new frontier in HIV therapy may be defined by the
maintenance of a high level of CD4+ T cells.
Common γ chain cytokines IL-2 and IL-7 play a critical role in
T cell homeostasis and T cell survival. Both cytokines represent
promising immunotherapeutic strategies for the preservation and
restoration of the T cell pool in lymphopenic conditions. Admin￾istration of IL-2 cycles leads to a significant and exclusive increase
in peripheral CD4+ T cell counts in HIV-infected patients (44–47).
Although the potential benefit of IL-2 therapy is currently under
evaluation in phase IIIstudies, a large set of clinical data showsthat
its use islimited by a high frequency of acute toxic effectsthat lead
to discontinuation of therapy. Several preclinicalstudiesshow that
IL-7 administration in mice and primates is safe and has a signifi￾cant impact on T cell homeostasis (25, 30, 48, 49). Recently, rhIL-7
administration in cancer patients has provided interesting and
encouraging results for its clinical use (31, 50). However, IL-7 ther￾apy at supraphysiologic doses in HIV-infected individuals initially
raised severalspecific issuessurrounding the complex mechanisms
of T cell depletion associated with HIV infection and the potential
risk of viral replication (35, 51). To address these questions regard￾ing rhIL-7 administration in HIV-infected patients,we conducted a
prospective multicenterstudy. We demonstrate herein thatrepeated
administration of rhIL-7 was safely associated with robust and
sustained increases in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in
chronically HIV-infected patients with persistently low CD4+ T cell
counts despite virologic suppression under c-ART. These effects
were clearly dose dependent and already significant at lower doses.
We showed that expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cells remained func￾tional and responded in vitro to TCR stimulation and produced
intracellular cytokines after polyclonal and antigen-specific stimu￾lation. Interestingly enough, in the context of HIV chronic lympho￾Table 3

penic T cell depletion, increases in CD4+ cells remained significant
more than 45 wk after cessation of IL-7 administration.
Naive and memory T cells are both dependent on IL-7 for sur￾vival and homeostatic regulation in lymphopenic conditions (52,
53). In the setting of HIV infection, the dynamics of CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell subsets are severely perturbed. Several factors influ￾ence these defects, including the level of virus replication, imbal￾ance of cytokine production, dysregulation of cytokine receptor
expression, and chronic immune activation (18). A high propor￾tion of HIV-specific CD8+ cells also loses expression of IL-7Rα
and exhibits an activated memory phenotype (54, 55). During HIV
infection, as in other lymphopenic conditions, IL-7 plasma levels
are increased (56–58) and correlate with sustained downregulation
of IL-7Rα on naive and memory T cells (59). Whether circulating
levels of IL-7 explain the downregulation of CD127 expression on
T cells remains unclear, since the ligand-binding receptor usually
results in a transient downmodulation of the cytokine receptor.
A more likely explanation is that downmodulation of CD127
expression represents a state of cell differentiation driven by HIV￾mediated chronic immune activation. More recently, a relative
expansion of CD4+CD127–CD25– T cells exhibiting features of
activated effector cells has been reported in HIV-infected subjects
(60). Expansion of these cells may be driven by chronic immune
activation and have detrimental effects of the homeostasis of
naive and central memory T cells in the periphery. Interestingly,
we found that IL-7 therapy led to a significant increase of naive
and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations that are
usually functionally impaired and prone to T cell exhaustion in
HIV infection. Regarding the expected expansion of terminally dif￾ferentiated effector cells observed in HIV infection (61, 62), gener￾ally our results showed that IL-7 therapy may reshape the balance
of T cell subsets in favor of naive and central memory T cells in
HIV-infected subjects.
The mechanisms of T cell expansion during IL-7 therapy may
involve T cell cycling, increased thymic output, and T cellsurvival.
Whether the thymic output contributes to the reconstitution of
the T cell pool in IL-7–treated HIV patients is not easy to assess.
In patients treated with 10-μg/kg rhIL-7, precise analysis of the
earliest subset of naive CD4+ T cells showed a significant increase
in naive CD4+ T cells expressing a high density of the CD31 anti￾gen (CD4+CD45RA+CD27+CD31hi), a marker recently used to
identify RTEs (29). This result might suggest an effect of IL-7 on
thymic output. However, we were unable to confirm this effect,
because the low number of these cells did not allow us to analyze
their TREC content, which would have provided an indirect mea￾sure of thymic output (63). Nevertheless, analysis of sorted RTEs
in cancer patients treated with IL-7 showed a dilution of TREC
content related to the high level of cycling cells in this subset (31).
The same result would be expected in our study, given the high
level of Ki67+ cells within the naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets
(Figure 4). On the other hand, the contribution of increased thy￾mic output to the changes in naive CD4+ T cell expansion could
be delayed for months and requires further evaluation in patients
receiving chronic IL-7 therapy. As assessed by Ki67 staining,rhIL-7
therapy induced a peak of cell proliferation in the different popu￾lations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is noteworthy that this effect
was not associated with increased expression of activation mark￾ers on CD4+ T cells. The same experiments performed 2 or 10 wk
after cessation of IL-7 administration showed that the level of
T cell cycling returned to baseline in all patients. At the same time
points, the majority of patients maintained a level of CD4+ T cells
significantly higherthan that at baseline. Together, these data sug￾gest that IL-7 expanded T cells may result from 2 phases: a first
phase related to a rise in CD4+ T cells caused by an acute effect on
cell proliferation, and a second phase raising the possibility of a
preferential effect on T cell survival.
From a clinical standpoint, one concern is a possible refrac￾tory response to repeated administrations of rhIL-7 related to
the downmodulation of IL-7Rα on expanded cells. Although the
schedule of administration of IL-7 in our study and in cancer
patientsseems empirical, administration every other day was based
upon data in primate modelsshowing that IL-7 induced transient
downmodulation of its receptor on peripheral T cells (48). We did
not check for the kinetics of IL-7Rα expression immediately fol￾lowing IL-7 administration. However, in the long-term follow-up,
we found that rhIL-7–expanded T cells continuously expressed
IL-7Rα. Moreover, although not glycosylated, rhIL-7 did not elicit
neutralizing antibodies, and no patient had experienced lympho￾penia after 1 year of follow-up. The population of patientsselected
in this study failed to restore CD4+ T cell counts despite a lengthy
period of c-ART and prolonged suppression of viral replication.
Ourresultsshowed that this population should benefit most from
IL-7 therapy, since tolerated doses caused significantly increased
CD4+ T cell counts. On the other hand, correlation between base￾line CD4+ cell counts and the CD4 response to IL-7 suggests that
the population selected may be the group that responds less to
IL-7. Therefore, when considering the future of IL-7 studies, lower
doses should still continue to be evaluated, because a stronger
effect of IL-7 at lower doses could be expected in lessimmunocom￾promised patients. One clinical consequence of these observations
isthat IL-7 might represent a promising cytokine for treatment of
chronic lymphopenic conditions such as HIV disease, where sus￾tained therapy is required over many years.
One possible limitation of the use of IL-7 in HIV settings was
raised by experimental data showing that IL-7 may enhance HIV
replication (35, 36). In addition, IL-7 induces a state of virus per￾missivenessin quiescent or naive CD4+ T cells(64). Finally, in vitro,
IL-7 powerfully stimulates transcription and replication of quies￾cent HIV provirus integrated in mononuclear cells from patients
(51, 65). This effect appeared to be more potent and qualitatively
differentthan that with IL-2,since quasispeciesreactivated by both
cytokines were widely distinct (51). In our study, patients treated
at the 3-μg/kg dose did not experience any blips in viral replica￾tion. In contrast, 4 of 7 patientstreated with the 10-μg/kg dose had
transient and limited peaks of viralreplication within the period of
IL-7 administration or at 12 wk. The explanation for these blips is
unclear, becausewe did notfind any obvious clinical(lack oftherapy
adherence, drug interaction, changes in drug regimen, or intercur￾rentinfection) orimmunological (markers of cell activation) expla￾nation. However,we found thatIL-7 did not affectthe pool ofCD4+
infected cells, as assessed by the constant values of HIV DNA con￾tent in PBMCs or CD4+ T cells throughout the study. Final inter￾pretation of the effects of IL-7 in vivo on viral replication islimited
by the absence of a control group in our study. Nevertheless, these
results underscore the importance of carefully monitoring viral
load in future randomized studies. Itis also interesting to note that
all 4 patients with transient viralreplication exhibited a significant
rise in the frequency of IL-2/IFN-γ HIV-Gag–specific CD4+ T cell
responses. This observation might have immunological and clini￾cal consequences for the future development of rhIL-7 in immu-

nocompromised patients. First, it demonstrates that expanded
CD4+ T cells under rhIL-7 therapy are functional and capable of
responding to TCR stimulation. Second, itsuggeststhatthe capac￾ity ofrhIL-7 to stimulate responsesto transient and weak antigenic
challenges may be a rationale for the clinical use of this cytokine
as a powerful immunotherapeutic agent to boost vaccine-induced
T cell memory (32). Thus, this potential effect ofrhIL-7 therapy on
viral replication may represent both a concern and an opportunity
for the use of IL-7 as an agent that may mobilize latent reservoirs
and T cell memory anamnestic responses, like those recently dem￾onstrated in murine models of chronic viral infection (33).
Broadly viewed, this clinical study — which we believe to be the
first — ofrepeated IL-7 administration in chronically lymphopenic
HIV-infected patients presents evidence that rhIL-7 therapy is bet￾ter tolerated compared with other immunotherapeutic strategies.
The effects of IL-7 on naive and memory subpopulations could
restore a homeostatic equilibrium not achieved by the control of
viral load alone under c-ART. This reshaping of the immune sys￾tem is associated with conserved functional properties of T cells
and a low level of immune activation. Moreover, the pharmaco￾kinetic properties of IL-7 offer the possibility of an intermittent
therapy as an adjunct to ongoing c-ART. The next generation of
glycosylated IL-7, characterized by a longer half-life and better in
vivo stability compared with the E. coli–produced molecule used in
the presentstudy,should permit the development of an optimized
therapeutic strategy with lessfrequent injections of IL-7, thus pro￾viding a more convenient schedule for administration in patients.
Furthermore, the good profile of glycosylation should lead to less
immunogenicity and allow for additional cycles of treatment.
These properties may confer a clinical benefit thatshould be dem￾onstrated in future large-scale randomized clinical studies.
Methods
Patients. Eligible patients were HIV-1–infected adults who had a CD4+ cell
count of 100–400 cells/μl and plasma HIV RNA levels less than 50 copies/
ml for at least 6 mo and had received c-ART for at least 12 mo. The popula￾tion of patients selected in this study failed to restore CD4+ T cell counts
despite a lengthy period of c-ART and prolonged suppression of viral rep￾lication. Major exclusion criteria were: a history of autoimmune disease;
any malignancy; coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus; pregnancy; and
concomitant or previous treatment with IFN, other cytokines, anti-HIV
vaccines,steroids, or any otherimmunomodulators. Blood cells and serum
chemistry values of patients were required to be within acceptable ranges.
IL-7. The drug substance CYT 99 007 is a nonglycosylated 153-aa protein
expressed as inclusion bodies in a recombined strain of E. coli containing
the DNA that encodes for the human protein (sequence originating from
the gene cloned from a human hepatocarcinoma). The product used in this
phase I clinical trial was GMP manufactured at a 50-l fermentation scale.
After fermentation, the culture was harvested, and a series of chromato￾graphic steps was performed to extract and purify the drug substance.
The purity of the drug substance was 100% by size-exclusion HPLC and
greater than 98.5% by SDS-PAGE. The product was lyophilized in a buffer
with 10 mM l-glutamic acid and 5 g sucrose per 1 g CYT 99 007 protein
and then reconstituted in sterile water. After reconstitution, the concen￾tration of CYT 99 007 was 1 mg/ml, pH 5.0. All patients were treated with
CYT 99 007 (batch no. M-ILK-PO2-FOR/2; provided by Cytheris S.A.),sup￾plied as freeze-dried powder suitable for s.c. injection after reconstitution
with bacteriostatic water.
Study design and endpoints. Patients were enrolled in a standard, multi￾center, prospective, open-label, interpatient, dose-escalating phase I/IIa
study of rhIL-7 therapy. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Com￾mittee of Henri Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and registered in the
EudraCT database (http://eudract.emea.europa.eu/; protocol no. 2004-
003772-11A). All subjects provided written informed consent before
enrollment. Visits for safety and immunological efficacy were performed
at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d and at 9 and 12 wk. At each visit, clinical data
were collected through an interim medical history and physical exami￾nation including lymphoid organs, and blood specimens were obtained.
Routine analyses were performed at each site throughout the follow-up
period and included complete blood and lymphocyte counts and tests
of liver, kidney, and pancreatic function. Measurement of plasma HIV-1
mRNA, with a lower limit of detection of 50 copies/ml, and of cellular
HIV-1 DNA (66) were performed centrally at Hôpital Necker-Enfants￾Malades. Blood samples were also regularly collected for pharmacoki￾netics and immunogenicity assessment. Safety was assessed through the
reporting of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, the severity
of which was assessed with use of the ANRS toxicity grading scale (67).
The primary endpoint of this study was safety. Safety endpoints included
the proportion of patients with grade 3–4 adverse events and laboratory
abnormalities. Virological safety of rhIL-7 administration was part of the
safety criteria, and dose-limiting toxicity was defined as an increase of HIV
plasma RNA greater than 500 copies/ml at 2 consecutive evaluations 2 wk
apart. Immunogenicity of rhIL-7 was also part of the safety criteria, and
dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a detection of anti–IL-7 neutraliz￾ing antibody with a 1:400 or greater titer. An Independent Adverse Event
Review Expert monitored safety and efficacy data throughout the study.
Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in CD4+ and CD8+
T cell counts. Immunological responses were defined as a 50% increase in
CD4+ T cells counts between baseline and the mean of the 2 values mea￾sured at 21 and 28 d, the final evaluation of this study. At 12 wk, patients
were asked to enroll in a long-term follow-up until 48 wk in order to deter￾mine long-term safety and the residual CD4+ cell increase until the end of
the first year. During this period, c-ART was unchanged, and patients did
not receive any injections of IL-7.
Flow cytometry. We used flow cytometry to assess the intracellular and
surface expression of specific markers on PBMCs collected at speci￾fied time points. Analyses were performed on EDTA anticoagulated
peripheral blood specimens on the same day without cryopreservation
in a centralized laboratory. Samples were stained for 4-color flow cytom￾etry using a whole-blood lysis method and analyzed on a FACSCalibur
cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (version 3.3; BD
Biosciences). T cells and T cell subpopulations were characterized using
a combination of directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD3,
anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti–α/β TCR, and anti–γ/δ TCR. NK and NKT
cell populations were characterized using a combination of anti-CD16
and anti-CD56 antibodies evaluated on CD3– and CD3+ lymphocytes,
respectively. We identified pro-B cells as CD34+CD19+, mature B cells as
CD19+CD20+, and activated B cells as CD19+CD10+. We further analyzed
T cell subsets on fresh PBMCs using anti-CD27, anti-CD28, and anti￾CD45RA antibodies and defined by the following antibody expression
patterns: naive CD4+ and CD8+, CD27+CD28+CD45RA+; central memory
CD4+ and CD8+, CD27+CD28+CD45RA–; effector memory CD4+, CD27–
CD28+CD45RA–; effector memory CD8+, CD27+CD28–CD45RA–; effector
CD4+ and CD8+, CD27–CD28–CD45RA–; terminally differentiated effec￾tor CD4+ and CD8+, CD27–CD28–CD45RA+. RTEs were characterized
as CD4+CD45RA+CD27+CD31hi cells. We used 5 ml blood to generate
mononuclear cells via a density gradient separation for determination
of intracellular Ki67 expression in T cells. Cells were stained with anti￾CD3, anti-CD4, or anti-CD8; fixed; permeabilized (BD Biosciences); and
stained for intracellular markers with isotype control or Ki67. Expression

of Ki67 was determined in T cell subsets following gating on CD3+CD4+
or CD3+CD8+ T cell populations. Expression of activation markers was
evaluated using anti-CD38 and HLA-DR antibodies. Expression of IL-7Rα
was evaluated using anti-CD127 antibodies. We used directly conjugated
mouse IgG isotype controlsto ascertain background staining. All antibod￾ies were obtained from BD Biosciences. The absolute numbers for each
population were generated using absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte
counts. We calculated the absolute number of cells/ml expressing a specific
phenotype by multiplying the proportion of the subset by the absolute
number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.
Proliferation assay. Freshly isolated PBMCs were added in round-bottomed
microtiter plates at 106 cells/ml in 100 μl RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% human AB serum. The cells were then treated in triplicate with 100
μl medium containing 2 μg/ml of baculovirus-derived recombinant p24 Gag
protein (Protein Science), purified protein derivative (PPD; Staten Serum
Institute), or CMV antigen (Virion). Positive controls consisted of cells incu￾bated with 5 μg/ml each of purified monoclonal CD3 (Clone UCHT1; Beck￾manCoulter) andCD28 (CloneCD28.2; BeckmanCoulter) antibodies; nega￾tive controls consisted of cellsincubated with medium alone. On day 4, each
wellwas pulsedwith 0.5 μCi[3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia).Data are
reported as net cpm, calculated as mean cpm [3H]thymidine incorporation of
cellsstimulated with antigen lessthe mean cpm of unstimulated cells.
Intracellular cytokine staining assay. PBMCs (2 × 106 cells) were incubated
in 500 μl RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum
and 1 μg/ml each of anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d antibodies and stimu￾lated overnight with 5 μg/ml of either baculovirus-derived recombinant
p24 Gag protein (Protein Science) or CMV antigen (Virion). Brefeldin A
(5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added after the first 2 h. Positive and nega￾tive controls consisted of cells incubated with and without 5 μg/ml SEB
(Sigma-Aldrich),respectively. Following stimulation, cells were stained for
surface antigen with peridin chlorophyll–conjugated CD4 and allophy￾cocyanin-conjugated CD69 antibodies (BD Biosciences). Cells were fixed
and permeabilized (FACS Permeabilizing Solution; BD Biosciences) and
stained for intracellular cytokines using FITC-conjugated IFN-γ and PE￾conjugated IL-2 antibodies from BD Biosciences. Fluorescence was mea￾sured on a 4-color flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences) using
CellQuest software (version 3.3; BD Biosciences). A minimum of 30,000
CD4+ gated events was acquired. The percentage of cytokine-producing
CD4+ and CD4– cells was determined after subtracting the percentage of
cytokine-producing cells in negative controls.
Pharmacokinetic analysis. Plasma IL-7 levels were measured at baseline; at
1, 2, 4, 6, and 48 h after the first injection of rhIL-7; at 11 and 16 d prior to
administration; and 48 h after the last administration. Levels were assayed
by ELISA (Diaclone SAS), with a lower limit of detection established at
3.125 pg/ml. The CYT 99 007 pharmacokinetic profile and main param￾eters were calculated using the noncompartmental extravascular model of
Kinetica software (version 4.2; Thermo Scientific).
Immunogenicity analyses. Anti–IL-7 antibodies were measured at baseline,
28 d, 35 d, and 12 wk using an IL-7–specific ELISA test developed by Cyth￾eris and transferred to SPI-bio. The neutralizing capacity of anti–IL-7 anti￾bodies detected at 28 d was assayed by bioassay.
Statistics. All patients who received at least 1 injection of rhIL-7 were
included in the safety analysis, while immunological activity was evaluated
in patients who received more than 1 injection. The Freeman test was used
to analyze changesin CD4+ or CD8+ cell countsthroughout the study. Dif￾ferencesin continuous variables were analyzed by using the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for paired data. Statistical analysis was performed
with SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc). A P value less than 0.05
was considered significant.
Note added in proof. Recent results of the large phase III SILCAAT
and ESPRIT trials have shown that addition of IL-2 to c-ART
does not provide any additional clinical benefit in HIV-infected
patients (68, 69).
