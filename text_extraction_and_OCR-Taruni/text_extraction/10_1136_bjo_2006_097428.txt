Abstract
Background: Unlike the immune privilege enjoyed by low-risk
corneal grafts, high-risk corneal grafts experience rejection rates
comparable to liver and kidney transplants. Systemic
immunosuppression reduces the risk of rejection in high-risk
corneal grafts.
Methods: Systemic tacrolimus, a specific T cell inhibitor, was used
at a mean daily dose of 2.5 mg to immunosuppress 43 patients
undergoing high-risk corneal transplantation. Immunosuppression
was continued for a period of 18–24 months after the high-risk
corneal graft.
Results: During a mean follow-up period of 33.7 months, clarity of
the graft was maintained in 65% of patients. Eight patients
experienced rejection episodes while on tacrolimus, and this led to
graft failure in five patients.
Conclusion: Tacrolimus is relatively safe and effective in reducing
rejection and prolonging graft survival in patients with high-risk
keratoplasty compared with other series where similar
immunosuppression was not used.
