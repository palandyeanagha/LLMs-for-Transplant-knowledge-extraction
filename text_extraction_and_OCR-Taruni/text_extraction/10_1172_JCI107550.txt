A B S T R A C T Selective release of inflammatory ma￾terials from leukocyte lysosomes is reduced by com￾pounds which increase cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophos￾phate (cAMP) levels in suspensions of human leuko￾cytes and is augmented by agents which increase cyclic
3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in these
cell suspensions. Lysosomal enzymes are released in the
absence of phagocytosis when cytochalasin B (5 ,ug/ml)
converts polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to se￾cretory cells: lysosomes merge directly with the plasma
membrane upon encounter of PMN with zymosan, and
cells selectively extrude substantial proportions of lyso￾somal, but not cytoplasmic enzymes. P-Adrenergic stim￾ulation of human leukocytes produced a dose-related re￾duction in P-glucuronidase release (blocked by 10' M
propranolol) whereas a-adrenergic stimulation (phenyle￾phrine plus propranolol) was ineffective. In contrast, the
cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine chloride enhanced
enzyme secretion, an effect blocked by 1 0' M atropine.
Incubation of cells with exogenous cAMP or with
agents that increase endogenous cAMP levels (pro￾staglandin E1, histamine, isoproterenol, and cholera en￾terotoxin) reduced extrusion of lysosomal enzymes; in
contrast, exogenous cGMP and carbamylcholine chloride
(which increases endogenous cGMP levels), increased
fi-glucuronidase release. Whereas colchicine (5 X
10-' M), a drug which impairs microtubule integrity,
reduced selective enzyme release, deuterium oxide,

which favors microtubule assembly, enhanced selec￾tive release of lyosomal enzymes. The data suggest
that granule movement and acid hydrolase release from
leukocyte lysosomes requires intact microtubules and
may be modulated by adrenergic and cholinergic agents
which appear to provoke changes in concentrations of
cyclic nucleotides.
INTRODUCTION
Phagocytic cells become the center of inflammatory le￾sions (1) due, in part, to release of substances previously
sequestered within lysosomes. During uptake of particles
such as zymosan and immune complexes, polymorpho￾nuclear leukocytes of human blood (PMN)' remain
viable and selectively extrude lysosomal, but not cyto￾plasmic, enzymes (2-5). Selective lysosomal enzyme re￾lease proceeds independently of particle ingestion when
cytochalasin B (CB) converts PMN to "secretory" cells
in which an intracellular event (fusion of lysosomes
with phagosomes) becomes converted to an extracellular
event (fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane).
Under these conditions leukocytes release substantial
proportions of lysosomal enzymes. Zymosan particles
are not ingested but remain adherent to the cell surface
(6-8).
Intracellular movement of lysosomes, and of secre￾tory granules in a variety of cell types, appears to be

regulated by an as yet unclear interaction between cyclic
nucleotides, microtubules, and microfilaments (9). Al￾though microtubules are in a dynamic state of assembly
and disassembly, it is probably in their aggregated state
that microtubules exert their influence on cell mechanics
(10). Exogenous cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) and colchicine both favor disassembly of micro￾tubules (11) and both reduce selective enzyme release
(2, 3, 8, 12, 13). Exogenous cAMP, or compounds which
increase its cellular concentration, also reduces antigen￾induced histamine release from sensitized leukocytes
(14, 15) and lung tissue (16, 17). In contrast, deuterium
oxide (D20) favors formation of microtubules (18,
19) and augments histamine release from leukocytes (20,
21). Moreover, it has been reported that a-adrenergic
agents (which decrease cAMP levels) and cholinergic
agonists, enhance the immunologic release of histamine
and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A)
from human lung fragments (22). Cholinergic stimula￾tion of heart and brain preparations produces increases
in levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate
(cGMP) (23) and the introduction of 8-bromo-cGMP
to sensitized lung tissue (22) was associated with en￾hancement of antigen-induced release of histamine and
SRS-A. It therefore seemed possible that movement of
lysosomes to phagosomes or the plasma membrane might
also be controlled by autonomic agonists, cyclic nucleo￾tides, and agents which influence assembly of micro￾tubules.
Consequently, following the experimental protocol sug￾gested by Kaliner, Orange, and Austen (22), CB￾treated human leukocytes were incubated with a series
of autonomic agonists before zymosan challenge. The re￾sults obtained in these studies indicate that, in CB￾treated human leukocytes, release of acid hydrolases may
be modulated by adrenergic and cholinergic agents as
well as by cyclic nucleotides. It is further demonstrated
that agents which increase cAMP levels in suspensions
of CB-treated human PMN (isoproterenol, prostaglandin
EL (PGE,), histamine, cholera enterotoxin) reduce en￾zyme release from these cells whereas carbamylcholine
chloride (carbachol), which raises cGMP levels, in￾creases lysosomal enzyme release.
The role of microtubules in lysosomal enzyme release
was also evaluated by means of D20 and colchicine,
following the protocol suggested by Gillespie and Lich￾tenstein (21). It was found that D20 enhanced enzyme
release whereas colchicine, a compound known to im￾pair microtubule integrity (10) and reduce selective
enzyme extrusion (2, 8, 12, 13) modified the D20 effect.
METHODS
Medium. Cells were incubated in a medium consisting
of (millimolars): NaCI, 138; KCI, 2.7; Na2H P04, 8.1;
KH2PO4, 1.5; CaCl, 0.6; MgCl, 1.0; pH 7.4. The osmo￾larity of the buffer was within 5%9 of 300 mosmol by freez￾ing point depression technique. D20 replaced H20 in the
medium as required.
Human peripheral blood leukocytes were separated and
suspended (4 X 106 cells/ml) as previously described (2, 3).
Leukocyte suspensions used in the majority of studies con￾tained 83±4% polymorphs; the remaining cells were iden￾tified as monocytes and lymphocytes. Hypo-osmolar lysis
of erythrocytes, and subsequent differential centrifugation,
removed the bulk of contaminating platelets and mono￾nuclear cells. In other experiments purified preparations of
human PMN were obtained by means of Hypaque/Ficoll
gradients (24), allowing studies of cell suspensions which
contained 98±+1% polymorphs. Portions of cell suspensions
(1.0 ml) were dispensed into 10 X 75-mm test tubes and
incubated with CB (5 ,ug/ml X 5 min). Cells were then in￾cubated with the test compounds. A dose of theophylline
(5 X 10' M), insufficient to affect enzyme release by itself,
was usually added when cells were incubated with cAMP,
3-adrenergic agonists, and histamine. Metabisulfite, to a
final concentration of 0.01%, was added in experiments
with adrenergic agonists. Autologous serum (10%o vol/vol)
was then added and cells were exposed to zymosan. As
detailed in previous studies (3), appropriate control ex￾periments (a) indicated there was no preferential degrada￾tion of enzyme activity in resting or treated cells, (b) ex￾cluded the possibilities that particles and test compounds
interfered with enzyme assays, or (c) that there was
selective adsorption of enzymes to cells or particles after
their release into the medium. At the end of experiments,
tubes were centrifuged at 755 g at 4'C. The cell-free
supernates were removed for enzyme determination.
Cytochemical localization of myeloperoxidase was carried
out by a modification of the method of Graham and
Karnovsky (25) in which the cells were fixed for 5 h at
room temperature in 4% formaldehyde and 5% glutaralde￾hyde and washed overnight in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH
7.2). They were then incubated at room temperature in a
medium that contained 10% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and
0.01%, H202 in 0.5 M tris buffer (pH 7.6). The cells were
rinsed briefly in distilled water and postfixed in 2% 004
in distilled water for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed
twice in distilled water, en bloc, stained in 2% aqueous
uranyl acetate for 15 min, and washed again in water. They
were then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Spurr's
low molecular weight epoxy. Thin sections were taken with
a diamond knife on a Porter-Blum MT 2-B ultramicro￾tome (Ivan Sorvall, Inc., Newtown, Conn.) and viewed
with a Zeiss EM 9s (Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York).
Viability of cells. The integrity of leukocytes in the
pellets at the end of experiments was assayed by several
techniques. (a) Exclusion of eosin Y: a cell pellet was
diluted in 0.5%o eosin Y in saline, mixed, and cells were
counted in a hemocytometer. Nonviable cells lost their
ability to exclude eosin Y and stained pink. In no instance
did the proportion of nonviable cells exceed 3%. (b) Pha￾gocytosis: the percent of untreated cells capable of phago￾cytosis (85%o) when zymosan was added after a 5 h
incubation period was no less than when cells were incu￾bated immediately with zymosan, and CB-treated cells re￾gained their capacity to the same extent in CB-free media.
(c) Release of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
was used as an indicator of cell death, since rupture of cells
by detergent (Triton X-100), sonication, or hypo-osmolar
lysis (60 mosmol buffer) leads to release of total assayable
LDH.

Enzyme assays. 8-Glucuronidase was determined at 18 h
of incubation with phenolphthalein glucuronic acid as sub￾strate, as previously described (26). LDH was determined￾by the method of Wacker, Ulmer, and Vallee (27).
The platelet: leukocyte ratio of the cell suspensions was
5:1. Platelets, present even in 20-fold excess, contained
negligible proportions of total f8-glucuronidase activity (3).
The contribution to total enzyme activity of leukocyte sub￾populations was determined after separation of cells by
means of Hypaque/Ficoll gradients (24).
cAMP determinations. At appropriate times, 0.1 ml 60%
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to purified prepara￾tions of PMN suspensions (107 cells). After sonication
(Sonifier Cell Disruptor; Heat System-Ultrasonics, Inc.,
Plainview, N. Y.) particulate material was removed by
centrifugation and TCA was extracted from the super￾natant fluid by four washes with 5 vol of water-saturated
ether. Duplicate 50-il samples were assayed for cAMP by
the protein-binding competition method of Gilman (28).
The following modifications were employed: (a) Protein
kinase was purified from frozen bovine heart muscle
through the ammonium sulfate fractionation step and sub￾sequent dialysis (29). (b) Each tube containing standard
cAMP (Caibiochem, San Diego, Calif.), solutions also
contained a volume of ether-extracted TCA solution equal
to the volume of the unknown sample to minimize any
possible effects of these substances on the assay. (c) Dex￾tran-coated charcoal was used to separate free cAMP from
protein kinase-bound cAMP according to the method of
Mashiter, Mashiter, Hauger, and Field (30). Liquid scin￾tillation counting of the supernate was performed in 10-ml
samples of a 1: 2 mixture of Triton X-100: Permafluor￾toluene solution (Packard Instrument Co., Inc., Downers
Grove, Ill.
Although addition to assay tubes of lysosomal enzyme￾rich supernates from zymosan stimulated PMN suspensions
completely inhibited binding of cAMP, a finding in agree￾ment with observations of a cAMP-binding inhibitor in
human PMN lysosomes (31), there was no inhibition of
cAMP in PMN preparations from which protein had been
removed by TCA precipitation and centrifugation. Recov￾eries were 100±5-5%. Individual values reported for cAMP
are the means of duplicate determinations from separate
incubation tubes. Duplicate determinations varied by no
more than 10%.
cGMP determinations. Hypaque/Ficoll-purified PMN
suspensions were prepared (TCA addition, sonication, ether
extraction) as outlined for cAMP determinations. Ex￾tracts were frozen and lyophilized overnight. The powder
was redissolved in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.2
and cGMP determined by radioimmunoassay as detailed by
Steiner, Parker, and Kipnis (32), with minor modifica￾tions. Sodium phosphate buffer was substituted for sodium
acetate since it has greater buffering capacity at pH 6.2.
Separation of free and bound forms of cyclic nucleotide
was achieved by addition of dextran-coated charcoal in￾stead of by second antibody precipitation. Contents of the
assay tubes were mixed with 1 ml of dextran-coated char￾coal adsorption mixture (2.5% charcoal, 0.3%o dextran,
0.25% heated human plasma protein fraction, 20 mM
KH2PO4, pH 6.0). The mixture was allowed to stand at
40C for 10 min before centrifugation (760 g) for 15 min.
Radioactivity of the supernates was determined.
Radioimmunoassay of cGMP as developed by Steiner et
al. (32) did not require purification of the nucleotide from
TCA extracts of tissues or cells. TCA extracts of human
PMN, however, contained a factor(s) which interfered
with the binding to antibody of cGMP and recovery of
known amounts of cGMP added to TCA extracts of PMN
suspensions averaged 70±10%o. We are currently investigat￾ing a simplified purification procedure to eliminate the
cGMP-binding inhibitor from extracts of PMN suspen￾sions. Individual values reported for cGMP are the means
of duplicate determinations and are not corrected for the
decreased recovery. Duplicate determinations varied by no
more than 5%.

CB was dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
This concentration of DMSO did not alter cell morphology
or enzyme release (6). Cholera enterotoxin was provided
by Dr. R. A. Finkelstein, The University of Texas South￾western Medical School, Dallas, Tex., who prepared it
according to published procedures (33, 34). There is evi￾dence that cholera enterotoxin loses activity rapidly when
dilute solutions are prepared in protein-free phosphate￾buffered saline.2 Portions of enterotoxin were therefore
added to PMN suspensions (containing serum) within 30
min of their preparation. In previous studies, where cholera
enterotoxin did not reduce lysosomal enzyme release from
phagocytic cells (35), care was not taken to use the entero￾toxin soon after dilution with phosphate-buffered saline.
Indeed, dilute solutions were often stored frozen and used
af ter thawing.
RESULTS
Tine of preincubation with pharmacological agents.
The time of preincubation with P-adrenergic agents was
critical for reduction of enzyme release to be demon￾strated. Preliminary experiments indicated that a lag
period of 5 min after addition of agents was required
for inhibition. Peak effects were observed when cells
were incubated 5-20 min. Consequently, cells were pre￾incubated 15 min withP-adrenergic agents in all experi￾ments. Zymosan-induced release of 8-glucuronidase from
CB-treated cells was assayed at timed intervals after
stimulation with carbachol. Enhancement of enzyme re￾lease was evident at 2 min, reached a peak effect within
5 min, and was minimal by 10 min. In experiments with
carbachol and cGMP, 3 min proved to be the optimum
time for preincubation (Fig. 1).
Distribution of enzyme activity. Suspensions of
mixed leukocytes contained 83±4% polymorphonuclear
cells. To exclude the possibility that mononuclear cells
contributed significantly to P-glucuronidase release, cells
were separated by means of Hypaque/Ficoll gradients

15 min with isoproterenol (plus 5 X 10' M theophylline),
or 3 min with carbachol, then exposed to zymosan (par￾ticle: cell ratio= 30: 1) for 30 min. Control cells released
25.6±2.8% of total p3-glucuronidase (5.2±0.7 ,ug/phenolph￾thalein/h/4 x 10' cells).
Effect on enzyme release of autonomic agonists. Cell
suspensions from several (n = 7) subjects were exposed
to the P-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Inhibition of
enzyme release varied directly with the concentration of
isoproterenol. In direct contrast, exposure to carbachol
resulted in a dose-related enhancement of P-glucuroni￾dase release (Fig. 2). In the absence of zymosan, carba￾chol did not enhance enzyme release. Epinephrine pro￾duced inhibition equivalent to that of isoproterenol (mea￾sured at 30 min).
In leukocytes from a minority of subjects (n = 3),
enzyme release measured at 30 min appeared to be un￾affected by autonomic agonists. These were studied in
detail and kinetic analysis demonstrated that the rate
of enzyme release was invariably modified: decrease in
the presence of isoproterenol, enhancement with car￾bachol. Moreover, when the concentrations of agonists
were raised by one log order, the expected results were
again obtained. An experiment with leukocytes from
such a subject is shown in Fig. 3. The rate of enzyme
release was decreased by isoproterenol (Fig. 3A) and
increased by carbachol (Fig. 3B), compared with con￾trol cells, during the first 15 min of zymosan exposure,
despite the fact that cumulative enzyme release after 30
min of zymosan contact was similar in control and
treated cells.
The effect of autonomic antagonists on enzyme release.
The effects on enzyme release of isoproterenol and epine￾phrine were prevented when cells were incubated with
3-adrenergic-blocking agent propranolol for 2 min be￾fore 3-adrenergic stimulation, whereas introduction of
the antimuscarinic agent, atropine sulfate, (2 min before
addition of carbachol to CB-treated cells) prevented
the cholinergic effect (Table I). Propranolol (10' M)
and atropine (10' M) had no effect on enzyme release.
Neither norepinephrine nor the relatively specific a￾adrenergic agent phenylephrine (10- 10-` M) had sig￾0 25 A

nificant effects on lysosomal enzyme release. At the
higher concentrations, phenylephrine displayed only its
P-adrenergic effect. Addition of propranolol with the
a-adrenergic agents did not significantly alter enzyme
release.
Effect of exogenous cyclic nucleotides on enzyme re￾lease. Incubation of cells with cGMP, the presumed
mediator of cholinergic stimulation (22), before chal￾lenge by zymosan, resulted in augmented 8-glucuronidase
release (Table I). In contrast, incubation of leukocytes
with exogenous cAMP, with its dibutyryl analogue, or
with compounds which augment endogenous cAMP con￾centrations in mixed leukocyte preparations, consist￾ently reduced lysosomal enzyme release from CB-treated
cells exposed to zymosan (Table II).
Studies with purified PMN. Experiments with puri￾fied (98±1%) preparations of PMN obtained from
Hypaque/Ficoll gradients indicated that these cells were
capable of selective enzyme extrusion; this could be re￾duced by addition to cells of agents known to increase
endogenous cAMP (Table II). Whereas reduction of
zymosan induced enzyme release by dibutyryl cAMP
and PGE1 was comparable in PMN and mixed leukocyte
preparations, the effects of histamine, isoproterenol, and
cholera enterotoxin were less marked in PMN than in
mixed leukocyte suspensions.

stimulate greater accumulations of cAMP in lymphocytes
and mixed leukocytes than in PMN. We have confirmed
these findings and have observed that preparations of
purified PMN accumulated cAMP in response to iso￾proterenol and PGE1 maximally within the first 5 min
(Fig. 4). In addition, the rapid accumulation and/or
release of cAMP which followed exposure of CB-treated
PMN to zymosan was enhanced and sustained when these

370C. D20 alone did not induce enzyme release in un￾stimulated cells. Colchicine, as previously reported (8,
12), reduced P-glucuronidase release, whereas D20
enhanced release. In the presence of both D20 and col￾chicine, release was intermediate between that induced
by either agent alone (Fig. 7).
Morphology of enzyme secretion. Cells incubated
with CB, then fixed and stained for endogenous pero￾xidase, showed many dense, peroxidase-positive, azuro￾philic granules as well as peroxidase negative specific
granules scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 8a).
Whereas large organelles such as the nucleus. centrioles,
mitochondria, and granules could be seen, fine structures
of the cytoplasm such as microtubules, microfilaments, or
glvcogen granules were not visualized by the cytochemi￾cal procedure used specificially to stain myeloperoxi￾dase-containing azurophils (25).
XWhen CB-treated cells were exposed to zymosan for
30 min and subsequently fixed and stained for peroxi￾dase, degranulation to the plasma membrane could
be demonstrated morphologically (Fig. 8b). Peroxidase￾positive granules were neither so numerous nor as
densely stained in the cell interior when compared with
resting cells. Indeed, peroxidase-positive deposits could
be seen at the cell-zymosan interface (Fig. 8b).
Cells incubated with carbachol (10 M) as well as
with CB, before exposure to zymosan, underwent exten￾sive degranulation. Large, dense masses of peroxidase￾positive material were observed to lie between the cells
and the adherent zymosan particles, whereas relatively
few lysosomes remained intact in the cell cytoplasm.
Furthermore, in cells treated with carbachol and CB,
fewer lysosomal residua remained visible in the cell in￾terior. Large areas of featureless cytoplasm appeared
which were free of granules and vacuoles (Fig. 8c).
Similar extensive degranulation was observed when CB￾treated PMN were incubated with cGMP before their ex￾posure to zymosan (not shown). In contrast, when PAIN
were incubated wsith PGE1 (not shown), isoproterenol

DISCUSSION
It has been demonstrated (6-8, 38, 39) that the CB￾treated leukocyte resembles a secretory cell in which the
influence of various compounds on membrane fusion and
enzyme extrusion may be measured directly. These cells,
upon contact with a phagocytic stimulus (e.g., zymo￾san), selectively merge lysosomes with the plasma mem￾brane as if the latter were a phagocytic vacuole. Selec￾tive secretion of lysosomal materials after this merger
occurs in the absence of cell death and despite absence
of particle ingestion. The results of experiments pre￾sented in this communication suggest that the secretion
of lysosomal hydrolases from human PAIN can be modi￾fied by agents which affect cyclic nucleotides and micro￾tubules. Control of lysosomal enzyme release, summar￾ized in Table IV, may be compared with the regulation
of release of mediators of inflammation and secretion
of exportable proteins from other cell types:

Lysosomal Enzyme Release from Human Leukocytes 305

(a) f-Adrenergic catecholamines reduce selective ex￾trusion of lysosomal enzymes from human PMN exposed
to zymosan. Similarly, P-adrenergic stimulation reduces
immunologically induced histamine release from sensi￾tized basophils and lung tissue (14, 16, 17). In contrast,
the cholinergic agonist carbachol enhances lysosomal
enzyme release from leukocytes, augments histamine and
SRS-A release from lung fragments (18, 22), evokes
secretion of lysosomal acid hydrolases and catechol￾amines from the bovine adrenal gland (40), and induces
gastric secretion (41) and mucin secretion from sub￾maxillary gland (42).
(b) Appropriate blockade of neurohumoral receptors
(by propranolol or atropine) inhibits actions of the
autonomic agonists upon lysosomal enzyme extrusion
from human leukocytes. Release of histamine and SRS-A
from human lung fragments is similarly controlled (16,
17, 22).
(c) Human leukocytes possess specific and separate
receptors for endogenous hormones including B-adrener￾gic catecholamines, histamine, and prostaglandins (43).
Each of these agents stimulates accumulation of cAMP
in suspensions of mixed human leukocytes (15, 44, 46).
Our experiments demonstrate that each of these agents,
as well as exogenous cAMP (and its dibutyryl ana￾logue), added directly to leukocyte suspensions, increases
cAMP levels and reduces selective extrusion of lysoso￾mal enzymes from human leukocytes exposed to zymosan.
Consequently, it is reasonable to suppose that it is
accumulation of cAMP which causes inhibition of en￾zyme secretion. Similarly, exogenously added cAMP
inhibits the release of lymphocytoxins (47), histamine,
and SRS-A (16, 17). Although 8-adrenergic agents,
prostaglandin E1, histamine, and cholera enterotoxin
cause accumulation of cAMP in neutrophil suspensions,
far greater increments of cAMP are found in mono￾nuclear fractions (35, 36). Moreover, when neutrophils
were separated from mixed suspensions, after incubation
with isoproterenol, it was not possible to demonstrate
increments in cAMP (36) within cells.
In the experiments we report, as well as in those of
others (35), small but significant increments of cAMP
were detected after stimulation by isoproterenol. In such
experiments, the measured cyclic nucleotide represents
the sum of intracellular cAMP and that released into
the medium. Since cAMP leaks from stimulated cells
(48), it is important not only to measure intracellular,
but also extracellular cAMP.
Our experiments with purified preparations of PMN
indicate that isoproterenol, PGE1, histamine, and cholera
enterotoxin act to increase cAMP and to inhibit release
of lysosomal enzymes in the absence of mononuclear
cells. However, reduction of enzyme release is usually
more marked in suspensions of mixed leukocytes than
in suspensions of purified PMN. This would suggest that
mononuclear cells, perhaps by releasing their cAMP,
may further reduce enzyme release from PMN. It will
be necessary to define more precisely the nature and ex￾tent of intercellular cAMP fluxes in this system.
(d) After incubation with polystyrene latex beads for
5 min the cAMP content of human peripheral blood leu￾kocytes is increased severalfold (49). This increase,
however, has been held to be due to the accumulation of
the cyclic nucleotide mainly in mononuclear cells (50).
CB-treated human PMN exposed to zymosan respond
with only modest increments in cAMP. However, when
the cells are incubated with compounds which produce
these modest increases in cAMP levels and are then ex￾posed to zymosan, the cAMP burst is enhanced and sus￾tained. The reason for this is not apparent. It is possible
that adenyl cyclase stimulated by zymosan contact with
the plasma membane acts synergistically with adenyl
cyclase stimulated by the test compound to produce the
striking elevation in cAMP. Additionally, or alterna￾tively, the test compound may interfere with the me￾chanisms responsible for regulating the return of cAMP
to basal levels after zymosan contact.
Exogenous cGMP enhances secretion of lysosomal hy￾drolases from human leukocytes, results which are con￾cordant with studies in which the introduction of 8-
bromo-cGMP to sensitized lung tissue was associated
with enhancement of antigen-induced release of hista￾mine and SRS-A. There is evidence, in other tissues,
that cholinergic agents stimulate the accumulation of
endogenous cGMP (22, 23). Similarly, the results of
the studies presented here indicate that the cholinergic
agonist carbachol increases the cGMP level in suspen￾sions of human PMN and increases zymosan-induced re￾lease of lysosomal enzymes. This reciprocal relationship
between cGMP and cAMP, whether exogenously added
or endogenously accumulated after appropriate stimula￾tion, has been observed in other biological systems. Thus,
exogenous cAMP inhibits the uptake of uridine, leucine,
and 2-deoxyglucose by cultured mouse fibroblasts, an
effect counteracted by cGMP (51). In addition, exo￾genous cAMP as well as agents that elevate intracellular
concentrations of cAMP, prevent the transformation of
lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin (52, 53), and pre￾vent the cytotoxic actions of lymphocytes upon cells
bearing alloantigens to which they are sensitized (47),
whereas cholinergic agents enhance the cytotoxicity of
lymphocytes (54). Indeed, mitogenic concentrations of
phytohemagglutinin produced 10 to 50-fold increments
in the concentration of lymphocyte cGMP whereas lym￾phocyte cAMP was not elevated (55).
(e) A unique protein kinase, active upon histone, has
been isolated from purified human PMN (56). This
enzyme phosphorylates a number of substrates when ex￾306 R. B. Zurier, G. Weissmann, S. Hoffstein, S. Kammerman, and H. H. Tai

posed to cAMP and cyclic inosine 5'-monophosphate
(cIMP) (>1V, M) but not to cGMP. At present no
enzyme has been isolated, the activity of which is uni￾quelysusceptible to stimulation of cGMP.
(f) DaO favors the assembly of microtubules (18, 19)
and enhanced the selective extrusion of lysosomal en￾zymes from human leukocytes. D20 also favors the
secretion of histamine from appropriately sensitized cells
and appears to do so by virtue of an effect upon micro￾tubule assembly as evidenced by the fact that colchicine,
in histamine-rich cells, seems to reverse the effect of
D20 (20, 21). Colchicine, which binds to tubulin sub￾units (57), leads to disassembly of microtubules and re￾duces selective enzyme release. Moreover, prior incuba￾tion of cells with colchicine reduced the potentiating
effect of D20, suggesting that granule movement and hy￾drolase release both depend upon intact microtubules.
Similarly, vinblastine, which causes the disassembly of
microtubules by forming dense precipitates (58), also
inhibits release of lysosomal enzyme (8). Louie and
Dixon (59) have shown that phosphorylation of histone,
by introducing surface-negative charges, promotes dis￾assembly of histones: such experiments provide a pre￾cedent for disassembly of tubulin after protein kinase￾mediated phosphorylation.
It is therefore reasonable to suspect that each of these
agents acts at the same, final, site to prevent or enhance
the secretion of previously stored lysosomal hydrolases
to the outside. Our ultrastructural studies have demon￾strated that appearance of lysosomal enzymes in the
supernate appears to be due to the direct secretion of
the contents of lysosomes from a granule that has merged
with the plasma membrane as if it were a phagocytic
vacuole. Consequently, one explanation for our findings
is that the cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, effect
the state of assembly of microtubules in PMN and that
their state of assembly regulates the flow of lysosomes
and the secretion of enzymes to the outside. This, of
course, need not be the only site at which these agents
act. The reciprocal relationships between cAMP and
cGMP can be demonstrated not only when these agents
are added exogenously, but also when compounds which
influence their endogenous accumulation are exhibited.
Only studies in which it is not unlikely that inactive
cholera enterotoxin was employed (35) appear to con￾tradict the hypothesis presented above. We have now
shown that freshly prepared enterotoxin protected by
serum protein from inactivation stimulates accumulation
of cAMP and inhibits hydrolase release. However, the
results presented in this paper have been obtained with
CB-treated cells and cannot be unequivocally demon￾strated in cells not treated with this agent. The explana￾tion may lie in the fact that, in cells not treated with
CB, lysosomes merge with phagocytic vacuoles in the
interior of the cell and enzyme release to the periphery
only occurs by the process of "regurgitation during feed￾ing" (3). Thus, direct quantitation of fusion is not
afforded by measurements of lysosomal hydrolases in the
suspending medium. The bulk of these enter phagocytic
vacuoles intracellularly and drug effects may indicate
actions upon phagocytosis per se and not upon the
fusion process. It is only in cells in which phagocytosis
is completely inhibited by CB that it becomes possible to
quantitatively monitor this intracellular event by mea￾surements of the extracellular release of lysosomal hy￾dolases. However, our previous studies (37) have indi￾cated that intracellular degranulation (measured mor￾phometrically) is inhibited by exogenous cAMP and
agents which elevate endogenous cAMP. Moreover, pre￾liminary studies indicate that carbachol, which stim￾ulates endogenous cGMP causes enhanced intracellular
degranulation in cells not treated with CB.
