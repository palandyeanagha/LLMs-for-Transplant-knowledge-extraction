Abstract. The prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC) remains poor, particularly for patients with 
portal vein tumor thrombosis. Chemotherapy is one of the 
most significant treatment options for patients with advanced 
HCC not indicated for hepatic resection, percutaneous abla￾tion and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Systemic 
chemotherapy does not play a central role in the treatment of 
HCC due to the issue of low sensitivity for chemotherapeutic 
agents and the difficulties in administering a sufficient dose 
due to chronic liver dysfunction. Therefore, patients with 
advanced HCC are usually treated with hepatic arterial infu￾sion chemotherapy (HAIC), which is increasingly used as an 
approach to advanced HCC in Japan. HAIC provides moderate 
therapeutic efficacy and survival benefit with substantially 
tolerable toxicity profiles in patients with advanced HCC.

1. Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of 
liver cancer and its incidence is on the increase in many coun￾tries (1-5). Several non-surgical treatment options, including 
transcatheter arterial chemoemobolization (TACE) and radio￾frequency ablation (RFA) have been developed and are widely 
used in patients with unresectable HCC. However, these 
modalities are not indicated for patients with advanced HCC 
as they are not expected to survive for longer than six months 
(6,7). Chemotherapy is one of the few remaining options 
for patients with advanced HCC. Despite decades of efforts 
by many investigators, systemic chemotherapy has failed to 
demonstrate improved survival in patients with advanced 
HCC (8-14). HCC is resistant to chemotherapy and therefore 
no significant tumor regression effects can be expected. In 
addition, tolerability towards chemotherapy is low due to the 
decreased liver function as shown by the Child-Pugh class or 
CLIP score (15). Moreover, when HCC is accompanied by 
hepatic cirrhosis, pancytopenia has already occurred, thus 
making highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy more difficult 
to perform. However, one characteristic of HCC is that it does 
not easily metastasize to areas outside the liver; although 
metastasis occurs outside the liver, in most cases, intrahepatic 
lesions control the prognosis.
In hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), an 
increase in the anti-tumor effect against malignant tumors 
may be expected in the liver by injecting a highly concentrated 
chemotherapeutic agent directly into the liver, via the hepatic 
artery, in order to topically increase the concentration of the 
chemotherapeutic agent at the tumor site. Furthermore, since 
the agent first passes through the liver, which is the organ 
involved in metabolizing the chemotherapeutic agent, a reduc￾tion of whole-body side effects is to be expected. Consequently, 
in Japan, HAIC is generally performed for advanced HCC, 
as well as TACE. Excision, RFA (16) and TACE are well 
established as therapies, and their efficacies have already been 
proven. However, since the therapeutic efficacy of HAIC is 
lower than that of the aforementioned therapies, it is generally 
used in cases of advanced HCC in which excision, RFA and 
TACE cannot be performed or in cases where no therapeutic 
efficacy is expected, as well as in multiple tumor cases that 
demonstrate resistance to TACE. In addition, with respect 
to liver function, since class C cases of the Child‑Pugh clas￾sification demonstrate a low tolerance level, this therapy is 
considered to be targeted towards cases of either class A or B. 
For the previously described algorithm in HCC, class A or B 
is considered.

260 UEDA et al: TOXICITY AND EFFICACY OF HAIC FOR ADVANCED HCC
When performing HAIC, the insertion of a catheter into 
the hepatic artery is required. There are two methods by which 
a catheter is inserted: the one-shot intra-arterial injection, 
in which a catheter is inserted for a single application of the 
chemotherapeutic agent every time chemotherapy is admin￾istered; and the reservoir intra-arterial injection, in which a 
reservoir system is embedded under the skin for continuous 
infusion or repetitive administration. When using a regimen in 
which the time required for an intra-arterial injection is short 
and where administration is required only at a frequency of 
approximately once a month (for example, epirubicin hydro￾chloride, cisplatin and other similar agents), the one‑shot 
intra-arterial injection is possible. However, when a long period 
of time is required for each administration, or when the admin￾istration is required at a high frequency such as once or twice a 
week (as in the case of fluorouracil plus cisplatin, fluorouracil 
plus interferon or other similar therapies), the reservoir intra￾arterial injection is necessary. Moreover, while hospitalization 
is required for each angiography to be performed for the one￾shot intra-arterial injection, the patient may receive injections 
as an outpatient for the intra-arterial injection method using the 
reservoir system, with the exception of the initial embedding 
of the system. The methods for indwelling the reservoir system 
include i) the gastroduodenal artery coil method, by which the 
tip of a side-hole catheter is fixed and indwelled to the gastro￾duodenal artery via the femoral artery or the left subclavian 
artery; and ii) the hepatic periphery fixation method, by which 
the catheter is fixed to the peripheral of the hepatic artery. 
Reservoir indwelling procedures which enable a safe, favorable 
drug distribution under the use of angiography are performed.
2. Intra-arterial injection using epirubicin hydrochloride 
alone
Epirubicin hydrochloride (EPI) is a stereoisomer in which the 
4'-hydroxy of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DXR) is reversed. 
It is an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent whose cardiac 
toxicity is milder than that of DXR. The maximum dose for 
myocardial damage is 25 mg/kg, thus enabling administra￾tion of the drug at twice the volume of the DXR conversion. 
Therefore, EPI is used instead of DXR due to its reduced 
cardiac toxicity. The response rate of the intra-arterial injec￾tion using EPI alone against non-resectable HCC is reported to 
be 15.1% (17). Moreover, the response rate of the intra-arterial 
injection using EPI alone against HCC with portal vein tumor 
embolism is 9%, and progression-free survival (PFS) is only 
1.1 months (18). Therefore, therapeutic efficacy should not be 
expected while using EPI alone. Its major side effects include 
leukopenia (34%), vomiting/anorexia (25%) and loss of hair 
(24%); it can severely aggravate myocardial damage, hepatobi￾liary disorders and gastroduodenal ulcers (3). 
3. Intra-arterial injection using cisplatin alone
Cisplatin (IA-call®) is a powdered cisplatin (cis-diamminedi￾chloroplatinum, CDDP) chemotherapeutic agent suitable for 
hepatic intra-arterial administration. IA-call demonstrates 
an anti-tumor effect (cytotoxic reaction) by binding to the 
DNA strands in cancer cells and inhibiting DNA synthesis 
and subsequently, the cancer cell. The dose-limiting toxicity 
of IA-call causes neutropenia, which limits the maximum 
tolerated dose to 80 mg/m2
, with an optimal dose of 65 mg/
m2
. Using the optimal dose, a response rate of 26.7% was 
obtained. In the phase II study, the optimal dose of 65 mg/m2
was dissolved in 70 ml isotonic sodium chloride solution. This 
solution was administered for 20-40 min and repeated every 
4-6 weeks. As a result, a response rate of 33.8% (19) and a 
favorable anti-tumor effect were demonstrated with a single￾drug administration. Kondo et al also performed the treatment 
on 24 patients with HCC, and reported favorable results with 
a response rate of 20.8% and a median survival time (MST) 
of 7.0 months (20). In addition, IA-call is generally used as a 
chemotherapeutic agent in the use of the one-shot intra-arterial 
injection. The key side effects include leukopenia (79%) and 
thrombocytopenia (77%), as well as renal dysfunction (21%) 
and vomiting (76%). Renal dysfunction occurs mainly on 
the renal tubule. Therefore, reductions in the contact time 
between platinum and the renal tubule are attempted through 
large-volume infusion. When the total injected dose exceeds 
300 mg/m2
, the expression of neuropathy and auditory 
disorders increases.
4. Chemolipiodolization
It has been reported that the tumor-clustering property of 
ethiodised oil (Lipiodol®) remains in HCC at a high level 
of concentration when it is injected into the hepatic artery 
(21). Currently, Lipiodol is used in combination with chemo￾lipiodolization and TACE as a carrier of a chemotherapeutic 
agent in order to enhance various effects, including tumor 
selectivity, as well as to maintain the drug concentration. It 
is known that by suspending Lipiodol and EPI (22) or CDDP 
(23) and then injecting the suspending agent into the artery, an 
efficacy higher than that of a single use of EPI or CDDP alone 
is achieved. Moreover, 131I-Lipiodol containing radioiodine 
demonstrated favorable effects against hepatocellular carci￾noma with a response rate of 48% and a MST of 27 months 
(24). Miliplatin, a lipophilic platinum complex developed as 
a hepatic intra-arterial injection and is suspended in Lipiodol 
for use, is garnering attention. In the phase II study, it demon￾strated a high anti-tumor effect, with a response rate of 56%. 
In the randomized phase II study, miliplatin was compared 
with Smancs®; its effectiveness was equal to that of Smancs, 
but the incidence of adverse events, including angiopathy and 
hepatobiliary disorders, was minimal (25). Thus, miliplatin 
may be a highly prospective agent for TACE.
5. Fluorouracil plus low-dose cisplatin therapy (low-dose FP)
This therapy is an intra-arterial injection regimen in which 
a small amount of CDDP (10 mg/body/day or 10 mg/m2
/day, 
days 1 to 5) is administered as a modulator in combination 
with the continuous infusion of fluorouracil (5-FU; 250 mg/m2
/
day, days 1 to 5). The regimen, which is also called low‑dose 
FP (fluorouracil and platinum) therapy, is commonly used in 
Japan. 5-FU inhibits DNA synthesis through the inhibitory 
action of the intracellular metabolite FdUMP against thymi￾dylate synthase (TS) and interferes with the ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) metabolism by blocking the uptake of phosphated 
5-fluorouridine 5'-triphosphate into RNA (26), while CDDP 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 3: 259-263, 2012 261
acts on the tumor cell membrane and prevents transfection of 
methionine into the cells. This process reduces the intracel￾lular methionine pool, whereby it induces methionine synthase 
activity within the cells, thereby facilitating folate metabo￾lism, which combines with the methionine synthase, thus 
increasing 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2FH4) 
and enhancing the effects of 5-FU. Ando et al performed this 
intra-arterial injection on 48 patients with HCC accompanied 
by portal vein tumor thrombosis (27). As a result, favorable 
therapeutic results (response rate, 48%; MST, 10.2 months) 
were reported. Moreover, Okuda et al performed the same 
regimen on 31 patients with post-resection recurrent HCC 
and reported extremely favorable remote results, with a 
response rate of 71% and a 5-year survival rate of 45.7% (28). 
Tanioka et al also performed low-dose FP on 38 patients 
with HCC with no adaptive response to topical therapies, and 
reported favorable results with a response rate of 47.4% and a 
MST of 187 days (29). Ueshima et al performed low‑dose FP 
on 52 patients with HCC with no adaptive response to topical 
therapies, and reported favorable results with a response rate 
of 39% and a MST of 15.9 months (30). On the basis of these 
results, low-dose FP therapy has become one of the most 
prospective HAIC regimens against advanced HCC. The major 
side effects of 5-FU include leukopenia (8%), thrombocyto￾penia (2%), nausea/vomiting (9%), loss of hair (2%), diarrhea 
(20%) and stomatitis (6%) (30). When used with cisplatin, 
although the incidence of leukopenia and nausea/vomiting 
increased to 13% and approximately 35%, respectively, the 
tolerance level remained unchanged (27).
6. 5-FU plus IFN therapy (FAIT)
Fluorouracil arterial infusion and interferon therapy (FAIT) is 
another intra-arterial injection regimen. One cycle of treatment 
continues for 4 weeks, with interferon (IFN)-α (5 MU) being 
administered intramuscularly on days 1, 3 and 5 of each week, 
resulting in a total dose of 60 MU in a cycle. 5-FU (500 mg/
day) is administered into the hepatic artery for over 5 h using 
a portable infusion pump on days 1-5 of the first and second 
weeks through the intra-arterial catheter. This regimen is also 
commonly performed in Japan, as well as low-dose FP.
It has been reported that the anti-tumor effect of IFN 
increases when it is administered as a biochemical modulator of 
5-FU. Its mechanism of action includes direct anti-proliferative 
activity via IFN receptors and indirect action via its anti￾angiogenic effect (31). Sakon et al administered 5-FU to 8 HCC 
patients with advanced portal vein tumor thrombosis (32). 
Subsequently, they reported an extremely favorable anti-tumor 
effect, with a response rate of 63%. Additionally, according to 
the report of a similar study on 55 cases by Ota et al, favor￾able therapy results with a response rate of 44% and a MST 
of 11.8 months were obtained (33). Another study performed 
on 116 HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis by 
Obi et al showed the results to be favorable: the response rate 
was 52% and the 1-year survival rate was 34% (34). With regard 
to the above results, IFN-combined 5-FU hepatic intra-arterial 
injection chemotherapy is also considered a highly prospective 
and effective regimen. The major side effects associated with 
IFN (34) include leukopenia/thrombocytopenia (40-60%), 
chills/fever (approximately 100%), nausea/vomiting (5-50%), 
and a skin rash (5%). Although the side effects of cytopenia and 
fever occurred at a rate of almost 100%, they were not serious 
and the tolerance level was high. However, since the expres￾sion of IFN receptors in HCC tissues serves as an efficacy 
index, it is crucial to confirm the expression prior to therapy. 
Furthermore, certain studies have shown that FAIT should 
be carefully performed in the case of HCC patients with liver 
dysfunction (35,36).
7. Discussion and Conclusions
In Japan, HAIC has been frequently administered as a method of 
treatment for advanced HCC. The representative regimens are 
CDDP, low-dose FP and FAIT, as described above. According 
to these studies, a high anti-tumor effect and survival benefit 
are exhibited in advanced HCC treated with HAIC although 
the physical condition of patients with HCC is unsuitable for 
chemotherapy as compared to patients with other types of 
cancer. However, the evidence of its efficacy is not high, and 
HAIC has not yet been established as a standard therapy as no 
large-scale study has been conducted. A large-scale random￾ized study is necessary to obtain the required level of evidence.
Tolerability is another significant indicator in determining 
the standard therapy. Almost all cases of HCC that are 
complicated with hepatic cirrhosis demonstrate pancytopenia

derived from hypersplenism. Thus, attention should be paid 
to myelosuppression in the case of chemotherapy, including 
HAIC. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4, white blood cells, neutro￾phils and platelets are required at a level of at least 2000, 1000 
and 50000/mm3
, respectively. In addition, mucous membrane 
disorders such as stomatitis, which is a major complication 
with 5-FU, easily cause anorexia and hypoalbuminemia 
in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, and ascites derived from 
hypoalbuminemia may cause further anorectic aggravation. 
Therefore, the prevention of stomatitis is essential to maintain 
the performance status and administer HAIC.
A first-line regimen in HAIC has not yet been established. 
According to the clinical studies described, the efficacy of 
low-dose FP and FAIT is better than that of CDDP (Table I), 
although complications of the reservoir may occur. On the 
other hand, HAIC using CDDP alone has the advantage of the 
embolus effect when CDDP is lipiodolized. Major adverse events 
should also be taken into account when the regimen is selected 
(Table II). Furthermore, a recent study shows that the efficacy 
of low-dose FP is greater than that of FAIT. The median OS 
times using low-dose FP and FAIT were 13.2 and 7.8 months, 
respectively (Ikai et al; ASCO-GI, 2010). Several randomized 
phase III studies are required to determine a first-line regimen.
To further improve the outcome with HAIC, it may be 
worth considering FAIT using IFN-β. A previous in vitro
study revealed that IFN-β suppressed the proliferation of HCC 
more strongly than IFN-α both alone or in combination with 
anticancer agents (37). In addition, our study also shows that 
arterial infusion chemotherapy with IFN-β may be a prom￾ising treatment modality for advanced HCC (38).
Moreover, sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has been 
shown to significantly increase overall survival (OS) in a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of patients with 
HCC (SHARP trial) (39). Recently, Guan et al reported that 
the systemic treatment of HCC was no longer regarded as inef￾fective, with the approval of sorafenib being given milestone 
significance (40). In addition, a meta-analysis suggests that 
sorafenib-based chemotherapy is superior to placebo-based 
chemotherapy in terms of TPP and OS without increasing the 
severe toxic effects (41). In the future, a combination of HAIC 
with sorafenib may lead to improved therapeutic effects.
We reviewed the toxicity and efficacy of HAIC treatment 
in patients with advanced HCC, whereby CDDP, low-dose 
FP and FAIT are usually administered. HAIC is a promising 
modality for the treatment of advanced HCC. Recent clinical 
studies have shown that HAIC provides moderate therapeutic 
efficacy with substantially tolerable toxicity profiles in patients 
with advanced HCC.
