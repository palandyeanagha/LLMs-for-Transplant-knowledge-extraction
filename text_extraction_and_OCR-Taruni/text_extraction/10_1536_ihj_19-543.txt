Summary
Although an elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with the adverse outcomes
of coronary artery disease (CAD), less is known about its prognostic value among patients with low high￾sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. We enrolled 2,591 consecutive patients with stable CAD who un￾derwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and had available data on preprocedural hs-CRP and
NLR between 2000 and 2016. Of these patients, 1,951 with low-grade hs-CRP levels (< 2.0 mg/L) were di￾vided into quartiles based on the NLR values. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death,
nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke after the index PCI. Clinical follow-up data were obtained
up to 5 years. The median NLR was 1.9 (interquartile range: 1.5-2.5). During the follow-up, 102 events oc￾curred (5.2%), with a cumulative incidence that was significantly higher in the highest NLR group than in the
other groups (log-rank, P = 0.02). After adjusting for the other cardiovascular risk factors, the risk for the pri￾mary endpoint was significantly higher for the highest than in the lowest NLR group (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.09-
3.54, P = 0.02). Increasing NLR as a continuous variable was associated with the incidence of adverse cardio￾vascular events (HR 1.85 per log 1 NLR increase, 95% CI 1.19-2.88, P = 0.007). In conclusion, the adverse
long-term clinical outcomes of CAD patients with low-grade hs-CRP levels has been independently predicted
by increased NLR level. NLR could be useful for risk stratification of CAD patients with increased inflamma￾tory marker levels.

Key words: Inflammation, Atherosclerosis, Long-term outcomes
I
nflammation plays an important role in the patho￾genesis and progression of atherosclerosis.1-3) Inflam￾matory markers, including white blood cell count
(WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6, have
been demonstrated to be significantly associated with car￾diovascular disease.4-6) Recently, anti-inflammatory drugs
have been expected as new therapies for patients with car￾diovascular disease.7) Inflammation can alter the ratio of
peripheral neutrophils to lymphocytes, resulting in an in￾creased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR).8) The NLR
has been an established nonspecific biomarker of low￾grade systemic inflammation and has prognostic utility in
several cardiac conditions, such as acute coronary syn￾drome, stable coronary artery disease (CAD), and heart
failure.9-13) The prognostic value of NLR in CAD patients
with relatively low inflammatory condition, however, has
not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this study, we
aimed to investigate the association of preprocedural NLR
level with the long-term cardiovascular events in stable
CAD patients with low high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP)
levels.
Methods
This investigation was a single-center, observational,
retrospective cohort study. We only included those avail￾able preprocedural NLR and hs-CRP data among consecu￾tive patients with CAD and who underwent elective per￾cutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the first time at
Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, between
January 2000 and December 2016. Blood samples were
collected in the early morning after an overnight fasting.
With both values obtained from the same blood sample,
NLR was calculated as the ratio of the neutrophil count to
the lymphocyte count. Patients with known malignancy or
active inflammatory disease were excluded from the study.

The patients with low-grade hs-CRP levels (< 2.0 mg/
L)14,15) were finally included and divided into four groups
according to the preprocedural NLR (< 1.5, 1.5-1.9, 1.9-
2.5, and 2.5).
Demographic data and information about coronary
risk factors, medications, factors related with the revascu￾larization procedure, and comorbidities were prospectively
collected and analyzed. Blood pressure (BP) was meas￾ured on admission. Patients with BP > 140/90 mmHg or
those receiving antihypertensive drugs were regarded as
hypertensive. Dyslipidemia was defined as low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol of 140 mg/dL, high-density lipo￾protein cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, triglycerides of 150
mg/dL, or current treatment with statins and/or lipid￾lowering agents.16) Diabetes mellitus was defined as either
hemoglobin A1c 6.5% or medication with insulin or
oral hypoglycemic drugs. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of
<60 mL/minute/1.73 m2
, as calculated using the Modifica￾tion of the Diet in Renal Disease equation, which was
modified with a Japanese coefficient using baseline serum
creatinine.17) A current smoker was defined as a person
who smoked at the time of PCI or who had stopped
smoking within 1 year before the PCI. Left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed using left ventricu￾lar angiography or echocardiography before the PCI. All
patients had symptoms of effort angina, documented myo￾cardial ischemia, or both.
Prior to PCI, written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. This study was performed in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of
the institutional review board.
The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovas￾cular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal
stroke during the follow-up period after the index PCI.
Clinical follow-up data were obtained up to 5 years. Car￾diovascular death was defined as death from cardiovascu￾lar disease, cardiogenic shock, or sudden death. Clinical
follow-up comprised analyses of the office visit charts and
the responses to the questionnaires sent to the patients or
their families and telephone contact. Mortality data were
collected from the medical records of patients who died or
who were treated at our institution, and the details and
causes of death were obtained from other hospitals
wherein the patients were admitted. Myocardial infarction
was defined as evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clini￾cal setting and consistent with myocardial ischemia.
Quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard
deviation or as median and interquartile range (IQR).
Categorical variables were presented as frequencies. Con￾tinuous variables were compared among groups using
one-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square
test. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to exam￾ine the relationships between NLR and the other variables.
Unadjusted cumulative event rates were estimated using
Kaplan-Meier curves and were compared among quartiles.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the
univariate and multivariable covariates, and the hazard ra￾tios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
for each factor by Cox proportional hazards analysis.
Model 1 was adjusted for age and sex. Model 2 was ad￾justed for the variables in model 1 plus hs-CRP level.
Model 3 was adjusted for the variables in model 2 plus,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, body mass
index (BMI), CKD, and statin use. These variables in
model 3 were selected by univariate Cox hazard analysis
(P < 0.10). The logarithm (log) of the NLR was included
in the multivariate model, and the HRs and 95% CIs were
calculated. Differences were considered significant at P <
0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using JMP ver￾sion 12.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Of the 3,149 patients who underwent elective PCI,
10 patients were excluded because of malignant or inflam￾matory diseases, and 2,584 patients had available data on
preprocedural NLR and hs-CRP. Among these, 1,951 pa￾tients with low-grade hs-CRP levels (< 2.0 mg/L) were di￾vided into quartiles (Figure 1). For these 1,951 patients,
the NLR had a median of 1.9 (IQR: 1.5, 2.5) and a mean
of 2.1 ± 1.1. The clinical and procedural characteristics of
these patients are shown in Table I. Patients in the higher
NLR groups displayed relatively high prevalence of fe￾male sex and CKD and relatively lower BMI, total choles￾terol, and LVEF. No significant differences were found
among the groups in terms of age and prevalence of coro￾nary risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
hypertension, or current smoking. Patients in the higher
NLR groups were less likely to be taking statins on ad￾mission.
Table II shows the association between the log of
NLR and the clinical parameters. The NLR level had a
significant inverse correlation with BMI (r = −0.08, P =
0.003) and a positive correlation with hs-CRP levels (r =
0.07, P = 0.004). However, these correlations were rela￾tively weak.
The median duration of follow-up was 5.8 years
(IQR, 2.4-10.8 years). Follow-up rate at 5 years was
53.9%. During follow-up, 102 (5.2%) patients developed
the primary endpoint; 52 (2.7%) cases were cardiac death.
Table III shows the cumulative incidences of the cardiac
events. The cumulative incidence of the primary endpoints
among patients, which was stratified by quartiles of NLR,
is presented in Figure 2. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed
that the primary endpoint clearly and significantly in￾creased at higher quartiles of NLR (log-rank test, P =
0.02).
Table IV shows the Cox proportional hazards analy￾sis for the primary endpoint. In the unadjusted Cox
model, the rate of cardiovascular events increased progres￾sively at higher NLR quartiles (P = 0.02 for trend). Multi￾variate Cox hazard analysis also showed the association
between NLR value and cardiovascular events. In model
3, the risk for adverse cardiovascular events increased by
two-fold in the highest NLR group than in the lowest
NLR group (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.09-3.54, P = 0.02). Fur￾thermore, in the multivariate model, the continuous vari￾ables of the NLR values were related with the incidence
of the primary endpoint (HR 1.85 per log 1 NLR in￾crease, 95% CI 1.19-2.88, P = 0.007; Table V). Lower

low-grade hs-CRP levels ( < 2.0 mg/L) were divided into quartiles. Hs-CRP indicates high-sensitivity C-reactive pro￾tein; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; and NLR, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. 
BMI, CKD, and hs-CRP levels were independently associ￾ated with adverse cardiovascular events.
Discussion
The major findings of this study were 1) patients
with high NLR level were more likely to be women and
have CKD and low BMI, although age and the prevalence
of the other cardiovascular risk factors were not signifi￾cantly different among the NLR quartile groups; 2) the
cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint increased
with higher quartiles of NLR; and 3) even after adjusting
for the important covariates, a relatively high preproce￾dural NLR was strongly associated with cardiovascular
events in CAD patients with lower hs-CRP levels.
Several screening markers and scoring systems have
been used for CAD patients, but some are relatively costly
or difficult to obtain in everyday clinical practice. Con￾versely, NLR is a simple and inexpensive biomarker that
can immediately be obtained. Previous studies have re￾ported the predictive values of NLR in patients with vari￾ous cardiovascular diseases. For example, relatively high
NLR was associated with the incidence of atrial fibrilla￾tion,18) heart failure,19) and cardiac death.20) Fest et al. ana￾lyzed the data from the Rotterdam Study and reported that
NLR levels were independently associated with an in￾creased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality in
the general population.20) In that study, the patients with
relatively high NLR were men, older, smokers, had rela￾tively high prevalence of diabetes, and had a history of
cardiovascular disease. Compared with that study, this
study had, to a certain degree, different baseline character￾istics of the patients classified in the high NLR group.
Moreover, the relationship between elevated NLR level
and cardiovascular events has been shown in patients with
acute coronary syndrome.11,21) A recent meta-analysis that
included 23 studies on ACS patients demonstrated that a
high NLR on admission was associated with relatively
high mortality rate and major clinical adverse outcomes.11)
In contrast, only few reports were available on the rela￾tionship of the NLR values with the clinical outcomes of
patients with stable CAD.22,23) To the best of our knowl￾edge, this study was the first to evaluate the association
between NLR and the long-term cardiovascular outcomes
in stable CAD patients with lower hs-CRP levels. We ex￾cluded patients with high CRP level, so the incidence rate
of primary endpoint in this study was relatively low.
Moreover, the risk of cardiovascular events was not sig￾nificant between quartiles 1 and 2 groups. However, this
study clearly demonstrated that among patients with low
CRP levels, those with high NLR value had higher cardio￾vascular risk compared with those with low NLR. Early
risk stratification is important in the management of pa￾tients with CAD. Strict guideline-recommended therapies
might be considered for these higher-risk patients. Actu￾ally, statins or antihypertensive therapies have been re￾ported to decrease NLR.24,25) Although few intervention
studies have investigated patients with high NLR and
CAD, these treatments could reduce their adverse cardio￾vascular events.
There are several possible mechanisms to explain the
association between elevated NLR and cardiovascular
events. The clinical outcomes of CAD patients can be af￾fected by both high neutrophil count and low lymphocyte
count. Neutrophils secrete large amounts of inflammatory
mediators and regulate the inflammatory response.26) Fur￾thermore, neutrophils reportedly made an atherosclerotic
plaque more vulnerable by releasing protective enzymes,
myeloperoxidase, and superoxide radicals.27) Conversely,
lymphocytes represent the regulatory pathway of the im￾mune system; in particular, inflammatory activation was
reported to promote lymphocyte apoptosis.28) Moreover, a
decreased lymphocyte count has been reported as an early
marker of physiologic stress and systemic collapse secon-

dary to myocardial ischemia mediated by cortisol re￾lease.29) Previous studies also showed that other compo￾nents of WBC or platelet-related markers reflect inflam￾mation.30,31) NLR level could be better predictor of cardio￾vascular events although neutrophils alone are associated
with inflammation and cardiovascular diseases.
Among the several biomarkers of inflammation, CRP
has been widely used in the clinical setting to assess in￾flammatory disorders and has been found to be strongly
associated with the risk and prognosis of cardiovascular
diseases.4,6,32-34) Moreover, CRP was reported to strongly
correlate with neutrophil, monocyte, and NLR.9) However,
in the Rotterdam Study, even with the addition of CRP in
the multivariate model, elevated NLR level remained an
independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovas￾cular mortality in the general population.20) The inflamma￾tory pathways of NLR and CRP and their impact on CAD
might be different, although both of them are useful in￾flammatory biomarkers. In this study, we demonstrated
that the correlation between NLR and hs-CRP was rela￾tively weak, although NLR was strongly associated with
poor clinical outcomes in patients with low hs-CRP levels.
Our study had some potential limitations. First, as a
single-center observational study on a small patient co￾hort, unknown confounding factors might have affected

this study evaluated NLR or hs-CRP only once and did
not assess changes over time. Finally, various factors
might affect NLR levels and outcomes. In this study, NLR
level was significantly related to BMI or hemoglobin;
however, these correlations were relatively weak among
patients with low CRP levels. Previous studies have re￾ported that NLR is associated with various diseases or
clinical outcomes in patients with malignant diseases.35)
Some drugs, such as antithyroid drugs, antibacterial drugs,
were reported to affect WBC levels.36) In this study, pa￾tients with known malignancy or active inflammatory dis￾ease were excluded; however, several factors which we
could not know might affect NLR levels and results.

CAD indicates coronary artery disease; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; 
HR, hazard ratio; hs-CRP, high sensitivity C-reactive protein; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; and 
NLR, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio.
Conclusions
Increased NLR levels independently predicted the ad￾verse long-term clinical outcomes of stable CAD patients
with low-grade hs-CRP levels. NLR could be useful for
the risk stratification of CAD patients with increased lev￾els of inflammatory markers.
