Abstract
Deaths after percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may occur
within a few hours to a few days following the procedure because of hemoperitoneum and
haemorrhage from oesophageal varices or hepatic insufficiency. Pancreatitis has been recently
reported as a rare lethal complication of intra-arterial PEI, another modality for treating HCCs. In
this minireview, we analyze the literature concerning the development of acute pancreatitis after
PEI. Pathogenesis of pancreatitis from opioids and ethanol is also addressed. Treatment with
opioids to reduce the patient's abdominal pain after PEI in combination with the PEI itself may lead
to direct toxic effects, thus favouring the development of pancreatitis.
Review
Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) is a widely used pro￾cedure for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), and may be performed via conventional, "one
shot" or intra-arterial modalities.
While conventional PEI is performed under localized
anaesthesia and the amount of ethanol injected into the
HCC generally does not exceed 10 ml/session, "one shot"
PEI is performed under general anaesthesia and the
amount of administered ethanol is higher, ranging from
20 to 60 ml/session. Intra-arterial PEI is also performed
under general anaesthesia, but ethanol (up to 50 ml) is
directly injected, through a percutaneous route, into the
artery that supplies the HCC after visualizing and punctur￾ing this artery by using colour Doppler and B-mode ultra￾sound guidance. Interestingly, as demonstrated in a cell
culture experimental study on malignant and liver cell

lines, the cytotoxic effect of ethanol is dependent upon
both its concentration and the exposure time [1].
Since at present, the concentration of ethanol is standard￾ized to 95% and the exposure time of the HCC is consid￾ered to be practically identical in the two PEI procedures,
our opinion is that the development of complications
may only depend on the high total dosage of ethanol
injected and the patient's clinical conditions. However,
according to some authors, no difference in complications
(pain and fever excluded) has been reported when using
larger doses of ethanol [2].
The most frequently reported complication of these three
PEI modalities is abdominal pain that may be observed in
up to 48% of cases [3].
If pain is not tolerated, especially when the doses of
injected ethanol are high, the administration of nonopi￾oid or mild opioid analgesics may be required [3]. Since
cases of acute pancreatitis after opioid administration
have been reported [4-17], we believe that more attention
must be given when such drugs are administered. In fact,
it is ascertained that there is a close temporal relationship
(ranging from 1 to 3 hours) between opioid administra￾tion and the development of pancreatitis [7,18].
A number of physiopathological studies have elucidated
the mechanism through which opioids may induce pan￾creatitis. These studies most often implicate direct con￾striction of the sphincter of Oddi [18]; in fact, it has been
demonstrated that intravenous morphine increases the
intrabiliary pressure by enhancing sphincter of Oddi pres￾sure [14]. It has also been shown that, after biliary sphinc￾terotomy, pancreatitis may occur due to the sphincter
spasm [7]. Taking into consideration that sphincter of
Oddi dysfunction, a clinical syndrome due to a dyskinesia
resulting from a functional alteration of sphincter motility
or to stenosis, may occur at any age [19], our opinion is
that it should be excluded before giving opioids after PEI
in patients with HCC. This caution is very important con￾sidering that in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancre￾atitis, manometric evidence of sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction was found to vary between 39 and 90% [20].
Furthermore, most cirrhotic patients with HCC suffer
from cholelithiasis, and acute pancreatitis has been
reported to occur in association with secondary sphincter
of Oddi dysfunction, which is related to biliary calculi in
90% of cases [21]. According to some authors, since chol￾ecistectomy would seem to favour the development of
acute pancreatitis after ingestion of therapeutic doses of
opioids [7], we believe that pain management with opio￾ids after PEI treatment in cholecistectomized cirrhotics
with HCC should be performed with great caution.
Furthermore, interesting animal studies have demon￾strated that ethanol may have direct effects on the pan￾creas, such as microcirculatory changes and direct toxic
damage to the pancreatic acini [22-24]. Moreover, the
mechanism of ethanol-induced pancreatitis has been
well-studied in an interesting animal model in which it
was demonstrated that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction was
implicated in several forms of acute and chronic pancrea￾titis [25]. In fact, according to the authors, since trans￾sphincteric flow, regulated by the sphincter of Oddi which
acts as a pump, is a direct measure of sphincter of Oddi
function, an alteration of this trans-sphincteric flow after
intragastric or i.v. ethanol may indicate Oddi dysfunction;
the authors also investigated whether neural mechanisms
and gastric mucosal damage might play a role in this proc￾ess [25], demonstrating that both intragastric and i.v. eth￾anol administration altered the Oddi trans-sphincteric
flow. They also suggested, in accordance with other stud￾ies [26-28], that the fall in Oddi trans-sphincteric flow
might be due to the direct effects of ethanol, its metabo￾lites (acetaldehyde) and/or other humoural agents (super￾oxide, endothelin-1) on sphincter of Oddi motility.
Furthermore, an effect of ethanol and/or its metabolites
on sphincter of Oddi nitrergic innervations was observed
[25]. The authors thus concluded that reduced sphincter
of Oddi function might contribute to elevated pancreatic
duct pressure, which is one of the events required for the
onset of acute pancreatitis [25].
There are no reports in the literature of acute pancreatitis
after treatment of HCC with conventional PEI; in contrast,
a case of lethal acute pancreatitis is described as a compli￾cation of intra-arterial PEI [29]. This technique can only
be performed after the superselective puncture of HCC￾supplying arteries, and the extreme technical difficulty of
this method provides the major reason for the frequent
failures of intra-arterial PEI [30].
In an interesting study on large infiltrative HCC treated
with intra-arterial PEI, the volume of ethanol intra-arteri￾ally injected ranged from 12 to 50 mL [mean, 25 mL ± 13
(63% of total volume injected into tumour)] in a single
session and from 0 mL to 50 mL [mean: 15 mL ± 19 (37%
of total volume injected)] in the subsequent sessions [29].
A higher survival rate compared with that obtained after
one-shot PEI [30] was observed with this intra-arterial PEI
procedure [29]. However, the authors found that the main
specific complication of this procedure, which caused the
death of one of their patients, was ethanol reflux into the
pancreaticoduodenal artery, a condition that can occur
when the arterial branch of the HCC, in which ethanol is
injected, originates from a short left hepatic artery close to
the origin of the pancreaticoduodenal trunk [31].

It is obvious that in this case, the reflux of ethanol in the
pancreaticoduodenal trunk was the initial cause of pan￾creatitis through direct induction of a toxic necrosis of the
pancreas. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that
also opioids may have contributed to the development of
pancreatitis and that the alteration of the Oddi trans￾sphincteric flow induced by ethanol may have played a
role, although the authors did not mention this possibil￾ity [3].
Quite recently, we performed a "one shot" PEI (a total
dose of 50 ml) into two HCC nodules of 4,6 and 3,1 cm
respectively, in a patient with Child A cirrhosis. Pain man￾agement after the procedure was applied with morphine
(10 mg i.v. and 10 mg s.c.), and with paravertebral block
(right side) of D3-D5 by means of naropine 0,75 60 mg
(total dose). On the next day, the patient developed oede￾matous head pancreatitis. In order to reduce his abdomi￾nal pain, treatment with opioids (morphine 8 mg/i.v. and
tramadol 50 mg/i.v.) was maintained until two days after
PEI; then, only tramadol 50 mg/i.v b.i.d. was continued
until nine days after PEI. Despite an appropriate medical
treatment of oedematous head pancreatitis and paralytic
ileus (with octreotide, subcutaneous longastatine, hydra￾tion infusion and antibiotics), the patient's clinical condi￾tion further worsened and free subdiaphragmatic airways,
mild abdominal fluid collection and necrosis of the head
of the pancreas were observed on a contrast CT. Surgical
intervention was mandatory and histological examina￾tion of the resected organs showed necrosis of the gall￾bladder, chronic steatophagic inflammation of the
omentum, steatonecrosis of the gastric antrum with
microerosive gastritis, haemorrhagic necrosis of the
appendix and steatonecrosis of both the pancreatic head
and the duodenum. After a few weeks, the patient fell into
a hepatic coma and died of multiorgan failure and end￾stage hepatic insufficiency.
Based on the data available in the literature, our opinion
is that acute pancreatitis may develop in cirrhotics with
HCC treated with opioids to alleviate their pain after PEI.
The mechanism through which ethanol may induce pan￾creatitis is partially known. After PEI, ethanol cannot eas￾ily diffuse into the surrounding non-tumoural tissue,
since that tissue is firmer than the tumour structure.
Therefore, in this case, the development of pancreatitis
may have been favoured by the ensuing treatment with
opioids although it cannot be ruled out that ethanol may
have played a role; in fact, possible mechanisms of etha￾nol-induced pancreatitis may be pancreatic duct constric￾tion, Oddi trans-sphincteric flow alteration, metabolic
effects, direct cellular toxicity, all of which have been pre￾viously discussed [22-25].
An experimental animal study on rats with BW7756
hepatoma, performed to compare efficacy and safety of
two percutaneous ablation methods [PEI and PAI (percu￾taneous acetic acid)], showed that PEI had a lower mortal￾ity rate for complications than PAI, and that none of the
complications from either procedure was due to pancrea￾titis [32]. In fact, autopsies revealed that the deaths of the
rats were due to massive liver necrosis (about 40%) with
diaphragma involvement, or to complete inferior vena
cava thrombosis with extension to the right atrium.
In this experiment, PEI was performed under general
anaesthesia and opioid analgesics were not administered:
this might be the reason why no evidence of pancreatitis
was observed [32].
It is true that pancreatitis after treatment with PEI of cir￾rhotics with HCC is a very rare complication, but these
data, taken together, show that both opioids and ethanol
may induce acute pancreatitis.
It is well established that opioids can favour the develop￾ment of pancreatitis through a constriction of the Oddi's
sphincter. The fact that i.v. ethanol may alter the function
of the Oddi's sphincter [25] suggests that both in intra￾arterial PEI and in "one shot" PEI, the pathogenesis of
pancreatitis may have also been due to mechanisms of
motility dysfunction of the Oddi's sphincter.
Therefore, the combined administration of ethanol and
opioids may greatly favour the development of pancreati￾tis in both procedures.
According to Beger et al., mortality after acute pancreatitis
is 7.6% when less than 30% of the pancreas is necrotic
and 24% when up to 50% of the pancreas is necrotic.
However, mortality is 34.3% when there are additional
extrapancreatic fluid effusions [33]. According to Rau et
al. and Hartwig et al., the mortality rate after acute pancre￾atitis varies from 20 to 30% [34,35].
In animal models of severe necrotizing pancreatitis, mor￾tality is promoted by sepsis and by the development of a
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which, in
turn, causes lethal multiorgan failure [36,37].
Therefore, given the elevated mortality rate of pancreatitis,
more attention is necessary when pain is treated with opi￾oids in cirrhotics with HCC after PEI.
