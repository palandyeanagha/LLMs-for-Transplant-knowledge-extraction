Objectives: Upon completion of this article, the reader should
be able to (1) understand the pathogenesis and evolving
epidemiology of Clostridium difficile colitis, (2) identify predic￾tors of fulminant disease and mortality, and (3) describe medi￾cal and surgical management options and expected outcomes.
Since the identification of Clostridium difficile as the
causative agent in pseudomembranous colitis in 1978, Clos￾tridium difficile infection (CDI) has reached epidemic propor￾tions.1,2 It is the most common cause of hospital-acquired
diarrhea and has become a major cause of morbidity in
hospitalized patients, reaching 250,000 cases in inpatient
care facilities in the United States in 2005.3
The spectrum of disease in CDI can range from benign, self￾limited diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis,
toxic megacolon, perforation, shock, or even death. Fulminant
disease can be seen in 3 to 5% of patients and can result in
mortality in up to 34 to 80%.4,5 In the early 2000s, a hypervir￾ulent, multidrug-resistant strain was identified in epidemics
across North America and Europe, and eventually in Asia.
These outbreaks were associated with dramatically increased
morbidity and mortality. Since that time, outbreaks of hyper￾virulent strains have persisted. As the severity of disease has
increased over the past decade, surgical intervention for CDI
has similarly increased. Despite greater awareness of the
disease and increasing colectomy rates, mortality remains
high.
Prompt diagnosis, early resuscitation, and directed treat￾ment are critical in preventing morbidity and mortality.
Understanding risk factors for fulminant disease and death
can help identify patients who may benefit from early surgi￾cal intervention. In this article, we will discuss epidemiology
and pathogenesis, predictors of mortality, current medical
management, and the role of surgery in patients with fulmi￾nant C. difficile colitis.
Pathogenesis and Epidemiology
Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore￾forming rod that can produce toxins that are damaging to the
colonic mucosa and are capable of causing a marked systemic
inflammatory response.4,6 Bacteremia from C. difficile is rare,
and morbidity from infection is due to a direct cytotoxic effect
on the colonic mucosa.
Colonization with the metabolically inactive spore occurs
in 2 to 3% of healthy adults and 20 to 50% of hospitalized
patients.7 Symptomatic infection results from transformation
of the spores into active bacteria, which can occur in the

Abstract Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) will progress to fulminant disease in 3 to 5% of cases.
With the emergence of hypervirulent, multidrug-resistant strains, the incidence and
severity of disease are continuing to rise. Prompt identification, early resuscitation, and
treatment are critical in preventing morbidity and mortality in this increasingly common
condition. Discontinuation of antibiotics and treatment with oral vancomycin and
intravenous or oral metronidazole are first-line treatments, but complicated cases may
require surgery. Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy remains the standard of care when
toxic megacolon, perforation, or an acute surgical abdomen is present, but mortality
rates are high. Recognition of risk factors for fulminant CDI and earlier surgical
intervention may decrease mortality from this highly lethal disease.

setting of microbial disruption following antibiotic
administration.
Although many strains have been identified, only strains
that produce toxins A and B cause symptomatic disease. These
toxins cause apoptosis and hyperpermeability of the colonic
epithelium by inactivating GTPases within the cells, thereby
disrupting critical cell signaling pathways and causing deg￾radation of the actin cytoskeleton.7 Both toxins cause neutro￾philic infiltration and fluid secretion and stimulate
production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor ne￾crosis factor-α, interleukin-8, substance P, and macrophage
inflammatory protein 2.4 Toxin B has long been considered
the primary virulence factor, but recent data demonstrate
that both toxins A and B can cause colitis and play an
important role in the disease process.8
Up to six other toxins have been identified, including
binary toxin, or C difficile transferase, which may be an
important virulence factor for CDI. It is an ADP-ribosyltrans￾ferase that similarly alters the actin cytoskeleton in colonic
epithelial cells, and is associated with hypervirulent strains
and may cause increased mortality.9 Together, these toxins
cause cell necrosis and sloughing, creating an exudate of
cellular debris and inflammatory cells that make the pseu￾domembranes characteristic of the disease.
Since 2000, there has been a dramatic rise in the incidence
and severity of CDI. Because CDI is not a reportable disease,
comprehensive statistics are not available, but studies from
individual centers consistently report increasing incidence,
morbidity, and mortality over the past decade. From 1997 to
2005, incidence rates grew from 3.8 up to 9.5 cases per 10,000
patient-days in a survey of Canadian hospitals.10 Recent data
from Michigan show an increase in CDI from 463.1 to 1096.5
discharges per 100,000 over the period from 2002 to 2008.11
Incidence can increase four- to fivefold during outbreaks.12,13
Overall directly attributable mortality of up to 6.9% has been
reported.3
NAP1/B1/027 (North American pulsed-field type 1, PCR
ribotype 027) is a highly fluoroquinolone-resistant, hyper￾virulent strain that produces binary toxin and levels of toxins
A and B in vitro that are 16 to 23 times higher than historical
strains.14 Since 2002, this strain has been associated with
epidemics in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia,
where morbidity and mortality had risen dramatically. Al￾though NAP1/B1/027 is the most well-known hypervirulent
strain, other genotypes including PCR-ribotypes 018, 056, and
078 have also been implicated in severe outbreaks.15
Relapse rates for CDI are high—up to 20%. Relapses are
associated with continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotic
and hypoalbuminemia, and like primary infection, can prog￾ress to fulminant disease.16,17
Risk Factors for Development of CDI
The strongest risk factor for the development of CDI is
antimicrobial exposure, with up to 98% of patients having
had at least one dose of antibiotics in the preceding 2 weeks.
When the disease was first described, clindamycin was the
primary agent associated with infection.1 Over the past two
decades, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones have played a
dominant role in pathogenesis, but a wide range of antimi￾crobial agents continues to be implicated in CDI.18 Although
broad-spectrum antibiotics are more likely to cause disease,
patients with any antibiotic exposure, including a single
perioperative prophylactic dose, can develop CDI.
CDI has long been considered a hospital-acquired disease.
Incidence increases with prolonged hospital stays, and higher
rates of infection are also seen in long-term care facilities.
Although hospital-acquired infections have been the primary
source of CDI, community-acquired infections now account
for up to 41% of cases. Community-acquired CDIs tend to
occur in younger, healthy patients and are less likely to be
severe. A greater number of these cases are not associated
with antibiotic exposure.3,19
Infection is also more prevalent, and often more severe, in
older patients. Age-adjusted rates of CDI are several times
higher in patients > 64 years old compared with younger
patients.10 Immunosuppressed patients, including those with
chronic steroid use, chemotherapy, or immunosuppression
after transplantation, are more likely to develop CDI and have
increased risk of fulminant disease, but in some cases mor￾tality from severe disease may be lower. It is unclear why this
is the case, but a heightened level of suspicion, early inter￾vention, lower threshold for surgery, and limited ability to
mount an inflammatory response to toxins may be factors.
Patients with severe comorbidity and postoperative patients
following cardiothoracic, vascular, transplantation, and gas￾trointestinal procedures also have increased rates of
CDI.4,16,20,21
Role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the development
of CDI remains controversial. PPIs suppress the secretion of
gastric acid, thereby potentially limiting the natural antimi￾crobial effect of stomach. Gastric acid suppression does not
seem to affect the spore form of C. difficile, which is already
resistant to low pH, but the vegetative form may be more
likely to remain viable through the gastrointestinal tract in
patients using PPIs. This effect seems to be muted by the
concurrent use of antibiotics.22–24
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are par￾ticularly susceptible to CDI and have a poorer prognosis from
infection. CDI has been shown to affect up to 4.6% of IBD
patients.25 These patients not only have worse outcomes from
CDI, but are shown to have escalation in medical therapy,
higher rates of colectomy, and increased mortality for up to a
year after infection.26,27 Patients can even develop infection
after total proctocolectomy, as CDI has been documented in
the ileum of patients with ileostomy or ileoanal pouch.
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis
Although CDI classically presents with watery diarrhea, pa￾tients with severe forms of the disease have additional
nonspecific toxic manifestations including abdominal pain,
severe bloating, profuse diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, sepsis,
and/or shock. It is noteworthy that 16 to 37% of patients with
severe colitis have no diarrhea due to ileus or fulminant
disease.4,5,16,28,29 Patients may progress rapidly to fulminant

disease or can develop severe symptoms days to weeks into
their clinical course.
Because bacterial or viral infections, Crohn’s or ulcerative
colitis, ischemic colitis, autoimmune and inflammatory colitis
can appear similar in their most severe forms, the initial
diagnosis should be guided by objective data, either by
laboratory confirmation of C. difficile toxin, toxigenic culture,
or endoscopic findings of pseudomembranes. C. difficile toxin
gene testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows
prompt diagnosis that is highly sensitive, similar to the
historical gold standard of toxigenic culture, which takes up
to 48 to 96 hours. Enzyme immunoassays to detect toxins A
and/or B are easy to perform and widely available, but have a
lower sensitivity (63–94%) and specificity (75–100%) than
gene testing or culture.10 A shift toward the more sensitive
PCR test may allow for improvements in targeted clinical care.
In addition to testing for C. difficile, comprehensive physi￾ologic assessment for patients with suspected CDI should
include a complete blood count, electrolyte levels, lactate
level, and arterial blood gas. Patients can develop a leukemoid
reaction with white blood cell count elevations from 30,000 to
50,000/microliter with bandemia.4 Hypoalbuminemia may
be present due to the protein-losing enteropathy caused by
the presence of the toxin. Stool examination for ova and
parasites and pathogenic bacteria will rule out most addi￾tional infectious sources.
Endoscopy is not mandatory if CDI has been confirmed, but
is useful in diagnosing or ruling out other causes of colitis.
Minimal insufflation will reduce the risk of iatrogenic perfo￾ration. Pseudomembranes are diagnostic of CDI, although not
all patients with CDI will have pseudomembranes present. If
pseudomembranes are seen, no biopsies need to be taken.
Moderate to severe abdominal pain or peritoneal findings
including rebound and guarding should prompt further im￾aging. An upright abdominal plain film can demonstrate free
air, identify mucosal edema or thumbprinting, and assess for
colonic dilation. In stable patients, a computed tomography
scan may demonstrate continuous or segmental colonic
thickening, pericolonic stranding, and ascites (►Fig. 1). Find￾ings of severe colonic distention, extraluminal air, or pneu￾matosis may indicate perforation or impending perforation
and lead to earlier surgical intervention.
Management of Complicated CDI
The term “complicated CDI” has been used to describe cases
with shock, megacolon, perforation, need for intensive care
unit (ICU) admission, emergency colectomy, or death within
30 days of diagnosis.7 Initial management of severe disease is
to stabilize the patient with isotonic fluid resuscitation.
Inciting antibiotics should be stopped, if possible, and any
antidiarrheal medications should be discontinued, as these
may potentiate the effect of the toxins. In severe cases of
colitis where CDI is suspected, empiric treatment should be
initiated while confirmatory tests are pending.
Metronidazole (oral and intravenous [IV]) and vancomycin
(oral) have been the mainstays of treatment since the initial
description of C. difficile colitis in 1978 and remain the
treatment of choice today. In mild cases of CDI, a 10- to 14-
day course of oral metronidazole is the first-line therapy.
Low-dose oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 hours) is pre￾ferred in cases of severe CDI where diarrhea and leukocytosis
are present, and combination IV metronidazole and higher
dose oral vancomycin (500 mg every 6 hours) should be used
in cases of complicated CDI.10 Rectal infusion of vancomycin
may be helpful in cases of severe ileus.
Systematic reviews of clinical trials comparing various
antimicrobial agents have failed to demonstrate any antibi￾otic that was clearly superior, although recent trials examin￾ing a new agent are promising for prevention of recurrent
disease.3,10,30 Two recent randomized controlled trials eval￾uated the efficacy of fidaxomicin, a selective antimicrobial
with high fecal concentration, poor systemic absorption, and
minimal activity against normal gastrointestinal flora. Results
from these studies showed fidaxomicin to be similar in
efficacy to vancomycin in initial clinical cure and more
effective in preventing recurrence (15% vs 25%, p ¼ 0.005,31
13% vs 27%, p ¼ 0.000232). Fidaxomicin has recently been
approved for the treatment of CDI in the United States, and is
available, albeit at significant cost. In three small studies,
teicoplanin (not currently available in the United States) was
found to have an initial bacteriologic response and cure that
was superior to vancomycin and metronidazole, but concerns
about study size and potential for bias limited interpretation
of these results. Rifampin and metronidazole in combination
were shown to have a significantly higher mortality than with
metronidazole alone. Vancomycin is found to have signifi￾cantly higher rates of bacterial or toxin clearance than
bacitracin.3,30
Other proposed treatments have targeted control or elim￾ination of the toxin to disrupt the pathogenesis of the disease.
One small study showed that C. difficile immune whey binds
toxin A and has been shown to have similar efficacy to
metronidazole in the treatment of recurrent CDI.33 Colestipol

is similar to placebo in the treatment of CDI. Toxin-binding
therapy is currently not recommended for widespread clini￾cal use.
Probiotics have been disappointingly ineffective in the
prevention and treatment of primary and recurrent CDI. No
advantage is shown to adding probiotics to antibiotic treat￾ment, and they are contraindicated in critically ill patients
who are at risk developing fungemia, a potentially life￾threatening side effect of probiotic administration.3
There has been a renewed interest in fecal transplanta￾tion in the treatment of recurrent CDI. Donor stool is
administered by direct infusion during colonoscopy. Recent
reports show 70 to 92% success in treating relapsing CDI.
There is currently no role for this technique in severe, acute
disease.34,35
Operative Management
Patients with an acute surgical abdomen require emergent
colectomy. As these patients may not have an established
diagnosis, intraoperative colonoscopy may help to establish
the diagnosis. Intraoperative findings may be nonspecific as
this is a mucosal-based disease. Colonic serosa may appear
normal or thickened.
Deciding when to intervene in medically managed pa￾tients is more difficult. Because of the nature and severity of
disease, few high-quality studies directly comparing surgical
and medical management exist and there are no prospective,
randomized studies to evaluate the role of colectomy in the
management of complicated CDI. Many recent studies at￾tempt to identify risk factors for fulminant disease, although
they are heterogeneous and most have a small sample size.
There is evidence that early surgical intervention can
prevent deaths. Patients with fewer than 6 days of medical
therapy prior to surgery have been shown to have lower
mortality. Lamontagne et al showed that patients undergoing
emergent colectomy were less likely to die than patients
treated medically (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] 0.22, 95% confi￾dence interval [CI] 0.07–0.67).14 Postoperative patients, who
are under the close watch of a surgical team, and those cared
for in the surgical intensive care unit setting, tend to fare better.
This may suggest that patients receive more timely surgical
intervention.
However, even in patients undergoing colectomy, mortal￾ity remains as high as 34 to 57% (►Table 1).4,5,16,21,28,36–41
Understanding the risk factors for mortality following colec￾tomy for complicated CDI can help identify which patients
may benefit from early surgical intervention. Data consistent￾ly identify markers of multiorgan failure as predictors of
mortality, including vasopressor requirement, hemodynami￾cally instability, need for mechanical ventilation, and renal
failure. These findings may be even more relevant in elderly
patients, who have been found to have a higher rate of
mortality from complicated CDI and from emergent colec￾tomy. Once these signs develop, the window of opportunity
for surgical intervention may have closed.
Laboratory markers have been identified that are associ￾ated with higher mortality in complicated CDI and may help
in quickly risk-stratifying patients. Leukocytosis > 50,000/
μL, lactate  5 mmol/L, and hypoalbuminemia, may identify
patients with impending shock and hemodynamic col￾lapse.39 Urgent colectomy should be considered in these
patients.
Subtotal Colectomy with End Ileostomy
Subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy is the procedure of
choice for patients requiring surgery for severe colitis or toxic
megacolon. Subtotal colectomy allows for control of disease,
stabilization of the patient, and preserves reconstruction
options for the future. Segmental colectomy has generally
been associated with higher mortality and does not address
the pancolonic nature of the disease. Similarly, ileostomy
alone, colostomy, and nontherapeutic laparotomy have gen￾erally shown increased mortality.
An open approach is the standard of care in most severely
ill patients. Careful mobilization of the abdominal colon is
performed to prevent perforation and intraabdominal con￾tamination. Vascular ligation near the colonic wall will mini￾mize collateral injuries during a difficult dissection. In cases of
severe colonic inflammation, ligating vessels first may mini￾mize inflammatory response. As mentioned above, intra￾operative colonoscopy is indicated if there is any question
about the diagnosis.
The colon can be divided at the distal sigmoid or recto￾sigmoid junction. Several options for the Hartmann pouch are
possible. A longer Hartmann pouch can be brought up as a
mucous fistula and matured at the bedside postoperatively or
can be sewn to the inferior portion of the fascia. These
methods for control of the stump help minimize complica￾tions resorting from a rectal stump blowout. Some surgeons
advocate lavage of the rectal stump with vancomycin irriga￾tion to help control inflammation in the Hartmann pouch.
Data for this technique is limited. A Penrose drain positioned
transanally may help to decompress the stump and prevent
leak.
Diverting Loop Ileostomy and Colonic Lavage
Although subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy remains
the standard operation for fulminant CDI, new alternatives
for treatment are emerging. Neal et al treated all patients
who presented with severe, complicated, fulminant Clos￾tridium difficile-associated disease over an 18-month period
(n ¼ 42) with laparoscopic exploration with diverting loop
ileostomy and colonic lavage with 8 L of warm polyethylene
glycol intraoperatively. This was followed by 10 days of
vancomycin antegrade enemas and 10 days of IV metroni￾dazole. Mortality was 19% and only three required subse￾quent total abdominal colectomy. End ileostomy or
colostomy has been associated with high mortality in the
past, but the authors attribute their success to the dilution
of toxins through colonic lavage followed by appropriate
antibiotic treatment.6 Although promising, these results
have not been duplicated at other institutions and should
be interpreted with caution.

Conclusion
Fulminant CDI is a highly morbid and often fatal disease.
Appropriate and timely treatment may help to reduce mortali￾ty. Vancomycin and metronidazole remain the primary antibi￾otic treatments of choice, although fidaxomicin shows potential
for an alternate agent. Early surgical intervention in elderly
patients, patients with severe leukocytosis, elevated lactate,
hypoalbuminemia, and/or signs of hemodynamic collapse or
organ failure may help to reduce mortality for complicated CDI.
