Abstract
Malaria is a global infectious disease that threatens the lives of millions of people. Transcriptomics, proteomics and
functional genomics studies, as well as sequencing of the Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens genomes, have shed
new light on this host-parasite relationship. Recent advances in accurate mass measurement mass spectrometry,
sophisticated data analysis software, and availability of biological pathway databases, have converged to facilitate our
global, untargeted biochemical profiling study of in vitro P. falciparum-infected (IRBC) and uninfected (NRBC) erythrocytes.
In order to expand the number of detectable metabolites, several key analytical steps in our workflows were optimized.
Untargeted and targeted data mining resulted in detection of over one thousand features or chemical entities. Untargeted
features were annotated via matching to the METLIN metabolite database. For targeted data mining, we queried the data
using a compound database derived from a metabolic reconstruction of the P. falciparum genome. In total, over one
hundred and fifty differential annotated metabolites were observed. To corroborate the representation of known
biochemical pathways from our data, an inferential pathway analysis strategy was used to map annotated metabolites onto
the BioCyc pathway collection. This hypothesis-generating approach resulted in over-representation of many metabolites
onto several IRBC pathways, most prominently glycolysis. In addition, components of the ‘‘branched’’ TCA cycle, partial urea
cycle, and nucleotide, amino acid, chorismate, sphingolipid and fatty acid metabolism were found to be altered in IRBCs.
Interestingly, we detected and confirmed elevated levels for cyclic ADP ribose and phosphoribosyl AMP in IRBCs, a novel
observation. These metabolites may play a role in regulating the release of intracellular Ca2+ during P. falciparum infection.
Our results support a strategy of global metabolite profiling by untargeted data acquisition. Untargeted and targeted data
mining workflows, when used together to perform pathway-inferred metabolomics, have the benefit of obviating MS/MS
confirmation for every detected compound.

Introduction
The past decade has seen an increase in international funding
for malaria control as it remains one of the world’s most significant
infectious diseases, with approximately 225 million malaria cases
and 781,000 malaria deaths reported in 2009 [1]. In light of recent
news that resistance to the highly-effective drug, artemisinin
appears to be spreading in Southeast Asia [2], while the
prevalence of drug resistance to other anti-malarial drugs is
increasing [3], strategies to identify anti-malarial compounds with
novel mechanisms of action are needed.
Metabolomics is the profiling of the total set of metabolites, or
low molecular weight biochemical intermediates, resulting from
the physiological, developmental or pathological state of a cell,
tissue, organ or organism [4–6]. Metabolomics has emerged as an
important field of research, hastening the development of new
accurate mass databases, MS/MS spectral libraries and complex
bioinformatics software [7]. The confluence of several key
enabling technologies: liquid and gas chromatography, mass
spectrometry, genome sequencing, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and the continuously evolving speed and storage
capacity of computers, have resulted in dramatic progress in this
field. As a result, untargeted, global profiling of malaria infected
RBCs has the potential to become a viable analytical approach for
malaria drug development.
Biochemical studies of Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal of
the four parasite species in humans, have been complemented by
more recent bioinformatics analyses of the malaria parasite
genome, transcriptome, and proteome [8–11]. This information
has been compiled to construct an organism-specific metabolic

pathway database (Malaria Parasite Metabolic Pathways, MPMP)
[12]. Based in part on the general metabolic pathways described in
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [13],
MPMP integrates features specific to Plasmodium metabolism. The
complete sequencing of both the human [14] and P. falciparum
genomes [8] has stimulated a wide variety of functional genomics
research, such that it is now possible to gain further insight into
mechanisms of host:parasite interactions. Nevertheless, approxi￾mately 55% of the protein-coding genes within the P. falciparum
genome are of unknown function (PlasmoDB 7.2 ApiCyc database
[15]), and are likely to encode components of new metabolic
pathways.
Host-parasite interactions in malaria are complicated by life
cycles in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, as well as distinct stages
associated with different tissues within each of these hosts. This
manuscript describes a strategy for global metabolomic profiling of
the intracellular protozoan, P. falciparum, and presents extensive
data on the metabolome of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
Differences in global metabolite abundance profiles between
normal and P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were evaluated
using an untargeted data acquisition approach. Since no single
method currently exists that is sufficiently comprehensive to
extract all metabolites, we developed a robust biphasic liquid￾liquid metabolite extraction and sample processing protocol that
included three different pH-adjusted solvents to facilitate extrac￾tion of metabolites with pH-dependent solubilities [16]. Hydro￾phobic and amphipathic metabolites were readily separated by
Reverse-Phase (RP) chromatography, while hydrophilic metabo￾lites were recovered by Aqueous Normal Phase (ANP) chroma￾tography [17,18]. We complemented LC analyses with GC/MS,
primarily for sugars and volatile compounds, via retention time
locked (RTL) matching to a spectral library of standards [19].
Two distinct bioinformatics approaches were employed for
finding compounds in LC-MS data: (1) a global, untargeted
discovery-driven workflow using an unbiased feature finding
algorithm for extracting hundreds of chromatographic peaks,
annotating peaks via database matching and mapping annotated
entities onto biological pathways to find biochemical signatures
separating NRBCs from IRBCs [20], and (2) a targeted data
mining approach employing an algorithm that searches for
features using a list of empirical formulas downloaded from a P.
falciparum database of metabolites. Pathway visualization software
was used for applying an inferred pathway mining interpretation
of annotated metabolites. This aided in determining the relative
representation of pathway-associated metabolites after querying
and mapping them onto P. falciparum 3D7 pathways downloaded
from the SRI registry of Pathway/Genome Databases (http://
biocyc.org/registry.html). In this way, no a priori assumptions were
made regarding the outcome of untargeted experiments. Inferen￾tial pathway associations based on annotated metabolite enrich￾ment were then used to help guide the selection of specific
metabolites for subsequent MS/MS identification and/or RT
matching of metabolites to a library of chemical standards.
Untargeted data mining resulted in over a thousand indepen￾dent features per sample. These features were then annotated via
METLIN database matching. Targeted data mining resulted in a
more limited list of features, but included some features that were
not detected using the untargeted approach. Our results demon￾strate high value in employing a broad metabolite extraction
strategy, coupled with different chromatographic separation
technologies, and MS-based multi-mode detection. Moreover,
combining a dual data mining strategy with an inferred pathway
enrichment approach reduces the number of compounds requiring
identification and validation and will inform the selection of
pathway proteins for subsequent targeted peptide multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) validation.

Ethics Statement
Collection of human blood samples for this study was conducted
according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of
Helsinki and under protocols approved by the Human Use
Research Committee of the University of Hawaii. All subjects
provided written informed consent for the collection of samples
and subsequent analysis.
P. falciparum in vitro Cultivation
The 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum was grown in human
erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM
HEPES, 20 mM sodium bicarbonate, 370 mM hypoxanthine and
0.5% AlbuMAX (Invitrogen) [21,22]. Since gene expression
throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum is thought
to be variable and highly regulated [10,23], an asynchronous
culture was analyzed to maximize the range of features detected.
Asynchronous cultures of P. falciparum infected red blood cells
(IRBC) and control non-infected red blood cells (NRBC) were
established at an initial hematocrit of 5% in 12-well cell culture
plates at 37uC under an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% O2, and 5%
CO2. Cultures were maintained in this manner with daily media
changes until the IRBC parasitemia reached approximately 10%.
The NRBC and the IRBC cultures were incubated in the absence
or presence of 250 units streptolysin O or SLO (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) per ml of culture for 30 minutes at 37uC to selectively
permeabilize non-infected cells [24] and consequently enrich for
metabolites in IRBCs. The concentration of SLO selected for
these experiments was observed to alter membrane permeability
but not result in RBC lysis, with the intention of allowing diffusion
of metabolites out of NRBC without affecting the overall biomass.
Altered permeability was monitored microscopically by evaluating
the conversion of erythrocytes from a biconcave to a spherical
morphology.
Study Design
Four separate biological replicate cultures containing 0.5 mL of
cells were prepared for each of the three pH adjusted solvent
extracts, totaling 48 samples equally divided between the
conditions: (1) NRBC, SLO untreated, (2) NRBC, SLO treated,
(3) IRBC, SLO untreated, and (4) IRBC, SLO treated. A separate
aliquot was separated by Aqueous Normal Phase (ANP) chroma￾tography and analyzed by LC-ESI - and LC-ESI +. All 48 samples
were analyzed by GC/MS.
Sample Processing
Samples were processed according to a biphasic liquid-liquid
extraction (LLE) protocol [16]. Briefly, RBC metabolism was
quenched by extracting metabolites into methanol/water/chloro￾form (4:1:3) solvents adjusted to pH 2, 7 or 9. To remove residual
proteins that would otherwise affect retention time reproducibility
and lead to detection interference in LC/MS, aqueous phase
proteins were precipitated with an equal volume of acetonitrile,
and depleted by centrifugation and filtration. The aqueous phase
extracts were filtered through pre-washed 0.2 mm Pall Nanosep
MF filters (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI), followed by 10 kDa
and then 3 kDa Pall Nanosep centrifugal device filters, briefly
dried under vacuum, and re-suspended in LC solvent: (1) for RP

separation, pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of 50:50 methanol:-
water, 0.2% acetic acid, and (2) for ANP separation, pellet was
resuspended in 100 mL of 70:30 acetonitrile:water, 0.1% formic
acid.
Analytical Workflow
Briefly, (1) metabolite recovery was maximized by using
different organic extraction solvents that were adjusted to pH 2,
7, and 9; (2) protein precipitation was followed by filtration of
metabolite extracts in order to minimize protein carryover; (3)
addition of unlabeled inorganic external standards: 9-Anthracene
Carboxylic acid and 1-naphthylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis
Mo) enabled tracking the efficiency of metabolite recovery
between sample extracts; (4) high quality solvents (ACS grade
.98% purity) were used; (5) chromatography runs were repro￾ducible with minimal shifts in retention time (typically RSD
,0.1 min); (6) sample injection volume was adjusted to result in
minimal (,5%) saturated peaks; (7) consistent temperature was
maintained in the autosampler and column compartments; (8)
simultaneous internal reference mass correction was performed; (9)
a clean and stable mass spectrometer ion source was used; (10)
complex, unbiased peak finding software was utilized; and (11)
public and proprietary databases/libraries were accessed for
compound annotation and identification.
Chemical Standards
Unlabeled, stock solutions of 10 mg/mL inorganic external
standards: 9-Anthracene Carboxylic acid and 1-naphthylamine
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis Mo) were diluted at 1:10,000 in the
injection solvent vials. Cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose
(cADPR) and all other chemical standards were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Standard stock solutions of 1 mg/
ml in methanol were prepared and diluted for analysis. N1(5-
phosphoribosyl)-AMP was synthesized from a cADPR standard by
hydrolysis of the cADPR phosphoanhydride linkage [25].
RP LC/MS
Resuspended aqueous phase sample extracts for all 48 samples
were separated by RP chromatography and analyzed by LC-ESI -,
LC-ESI+ and APCI +. Although we analyzed the different extracts
separately in this study, one can also combine the three sample
extracts corresponding to each condition, dramatically reducing
the number of samples to be analyzed. Metabolite separation was
performed on an Agilent 1200 LC (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). RP separation was achieved by injecting 1 mL
on a ZORBAX SB-Aq column (2.1650 mm, 1.8 mm), preceded in
series with a ZORBAX -SB-C8 Rapid Resolution Cartridge
(2.1630 mm, 3.5 um). The Agilent 6520 Quadropole Time-of￾Flight LC/MS (Q-TOF) was equipped with an electrospray (ESI)
ion source or an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)
ion source (see Methods S1 for further details). The organic phase
extracts containing a mixture of chloroform and methanol, were
centrifuged at 16,000 g, 4uC for 10 min. in order to remove any
cellular debris. The supernatants were dried briefly in a SpeedVac,
resuspended in LC solvent and analyzed by APCI, primarily for
the analysis of neutral molecules, such as lipids, as APCI causes
little or no fragmentation of the analyte, and is suitable for both
volatile and thermally stable compounds.
ANP LC/MS
Aqueous Normal Phase (ANP) is a good choice for separation of
hydrophilic metabolites on silica hydride columns. Prior sample
derivatization is not required, it is compatible with LC/MS, and it
exhibits rapid re-equilibration, and reproducible chromatography
[17,18].
Two separate, general purpose ANP chromatographic methods
were used to achieve retention and separation of compounds
because ammonia was observed to permanently alter the physio￾chemical properties of the silica hydride surface. Therefore a
separate Cogent Diamond Hydride (150 mm62.1 mm) column
(MicroSolv Technologies, Eatontown, NJ) was dedicated for each
of two methods: (1) for neutral and basic compounds, analyzed in
(+) ESI mode, and (2) for neutral and acidic compounds analyzed
in (2) ESI mode (See Methods S1 for further details).
GC/MS Data Acquisition and Peak Finding
The organic phase extracts for each of the samples were dried
and derivatized as previously described [26]: An Agilent 7890 GC
was equipped with a 30 m Agilent DB-5MS column. All GC-MS
experiments were performed as described in the Agilent user
manual [19]. The data was extracted using both AMDIS (NIST)
spectral deconvolution, as well as Agilent ‘‘Find by Chromato￾graphic Deconvolution’’ software (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). The Agilent-Fiehn GC/MS Metabolomics RTL
Library was used for compound identification [27].
Chemical Entity Definitions
There is currently no standard terminology for what a chemical
entity represents along different stages of a metabolomics work￾flow. In the current study, a ‘‘feature’’ describes a chemical entity
that is found as a result of using an unbiased (untargeted) peak
finding algorithm such as the ‘‘Molecular Feature Extractor’’
(MFE), or by targeted mining algorithm such as ‘‘Find by
Formula’’. A feature has neither been annotated nor identified
(see further details in Methods S1). Features are said to be
‘‘annotated’’, i.e. provisionally identified, when they have an
empirical formula assigned to the feature based on a database
match. An ‘‘annotated metabolite’’ has an accurate mass within a
narrow specified mass tolerance window that matches one or more
annotations in an accurate mass database, such as the METLIN
database. A corresponding empirical formula is also calculated
from the abundance, and a distribution of observed isotopes. The
term ‘‘metabolite’’ is used when there is evidence for confirming its
identity, for example by accurate mass and retention time
matching to a database of standards (AMRT), and/or by MS/
MS spectral library matching.
Data Acquisition and Feature Finding
Untargeted data acquisition on the LC/Q-TOF was performed
using Agilent MassHunterTM (‘‘Acquisition’’) B.03.01 software
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The data was
deconvoluted into individual chemical peaks with Agilent Mas￾sHunterTM Qualitative Analysis B.03.01 (MassHunterTM Qual,
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), using Molecular
Feature Extractor (MFE), a naı¨ve or ‘‘untargeted’’ data-mining
algorithm, which finds groups of co-variant ions for each unique
feature in a chromatogram. Raw data files were processed by
aligning the isotopes, dimers and adducts for each calculated
neutral mass, having a corresponding RT and abundance.
A targeted, ‘‘Find by Molecular Formula’’ algorithm was used
to find features known to be associated with P. falciparum using the
target list of literature derived,annotated elemental formulas that
were derived from the publicly available, MPMP database [12].
This was used to calculate the theoretical accurate mass for each
entry and added to a customized, malaria specific, Personal
Compound Database and Library (PCDL). This malaria PCDL
was uploaded into MassHunterTM Qual software and used for
Metabolomics of P. falciparum-Infected Erythrocytes

targeted data mining. A series of extracted ion chromatograms
(EICs) were saved as xml formatted files and were used for
subsequent statistical analysis and data visualization in Mass
Profiler Professional (MPP) software.
Data Filtering, Statistical Analysis and Visualization
For LC/MS data files, separate projects were created in MPP;
each corresponding to the pH of the extraction solvent, and the
ion mode and the polarity of the ESI source. Under each project, a
‘‘child’’ was created, that corresponded to all data files collected
for an experiment (for example, all the ESI+ data files for pH2).
Three separate projects were created for GC/MS data files. For
each experiment, the data files were binned, aligned, and log2
transformed and baselined to zero. The features found in each
LC/MS and GC/MS data file was filtered based on a relative
frequency (Rel Freq) threshold, which corresponds to the number
of features that were found in a defined percentage of all biological
sample replicates, in at least one or more conditions. For example,
features that were present in all (100%) of the replicates, i.e., 100%
Rel Freq threshold, were additionally filtered based on an absolute
coefficient of variation of less than 100% (CV,100%) within a
particular condition. Separate, filtered lists of features for each
condition were created for use in all subsequent downstream data
analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was
performed with mean centering and scaling to display the inherent
variance between the metabolic phenotypes. Infection state, pH,
SLO treatment, or combinations of these variables were used for
distinguishing between conditions.
Statistical evaluation of the data was performed using univariate
and multivariate analyses, including the Welch’s unpaired t-test for
independent pairs of groups, and one way ANOVA for multiple
groups. The effects of infection state and extraction solvent pH on
classifying the samples were compared. A cutoff value of p,0.05
was considered statistically significant in one-way ANOVA, using
the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate set to 5% for
multiple testing corrections [28]. The difference between each pair
of means with appropriate adjustment for multiple testing in the
ANOVA was investigated with the Tukey multiple comparison
test [29]. This resulted in a matrix table, revealing the results for
each pair of conditions as a p-value. Parameters were selected that
computed the Fold Change and p-values.
Identification
While high mass accuracy (,5 ppm) alone is insufficient to
exclude enough candidates with complex elemental compositions
(C, H, N, S, O, P, and potentially F, Cl, Br and Si), for
unambiguous identification, our use of isotopic abundance pattern
information as a further constraint removed .95% of false
candidates [30]. For LC/MS data, the annotated metabolite
compound identifiers were generated based on accurate mass,
isotope ratios, abundances and spacing, as well as RT and MS/
MS spectral matching to standards for select compounds. The
metabolites found to have interesting pathway mapping charac￾teristics, or to be significantly different between IRBCs and
NRBCs, were identified by accurate mass matching, and/or with
orthogonal RT matching to the METLIN database using the
Agilent Identification Browser (ID Browser). The results were
sorted and a single annotation with a matching elemental formula
from METLIN was selected. The Agilent METLIN database
(B.04) contained over 25,000 compounds, with links to KEGG
identifiers, CAS numbers, HMDB and LIPID MAPS identifiers.
From this, an inclusion list of m/z and RT values was created in
MPP. The lists of annotated, differential metabolites were used as
target masses for subsequent confirmation of metabolite identity
by accurate mass MS/MS and spectral library matching. Several
NRBC and IRBC samples were re-analyzed by targeted MS/MS
analysis on the Q-TOF. MS/MS spectra were acquired at three
collision energies (10, 20 and 40 eV) and the sample spectra were
compared and matched to a library of standard spectra in
METLIN PCDL, generated from MS/MS spectra of approxi￾mately 2000 standards.
Databases
A list of publicly available databases that were used in this study
is provided in Methods S1.
Pathways
Pathway analysis was performed using Mass Profiler Profes￾sional (MPP) v12.5, including the Pathways add-on in Pathway
Architect. The P. falciparum 3D7 strain of pathways in.owl format
were uploaded from BioCyc and queried under the Pathway
Analysis feature to generate matching pathways that were
graphically rendered by the Pathway Architect engine. In
addition, HeatStrips were generated that summarized a separate
HeatMap table of results for identified metabolites in NRBC and
IRBC conditions. The annotated metabolite IDs from our
annotated list of results were mapped to IDs in the underlying
BioCyc database using open source BridgeDB software [31]. The
results revealed a table summary for the total number of
metabolites per pathway and the number of matching metabolites.
Each pathway was then analyzed for the number of possible
associations, resulting in a sorted list of pathways that facilitated
data interpretation.
Results
Comprehensive Metabolite Extraction and Separation
Strategies Facilitate Detection of a Larger Proportion of
the Parasite Infected RBC Metabolome
An untargeted profiling strategy was employed to collect,
analyze, and identify metabolites and conduct pathway analyses
(Figure S1). Due to the broad spectrum of physicochemical
properties inherent to metabolites, sample preparation and
detection methods need to be extensive. Protein precipitation as
well as sub-micron filtering of extracts facilitated highly reproduc￾ible chromatographic retention times for each metabolite. The net
result was a large number of chemical features for data collected
by RP LC/MS or ANP LC/MS (Table 1). The pH of the
extraction solvents, chromatography conditions, MS ion modes,
and ion polarities all impacted the results significantly.
For RP LC/MS analyses, over two thousand features were
detected in ESI+mode; between 900–1500 in ESI - mode; and
several hundred features were detected in APCI+mode (Table 1).
The overall trend in the total number of features for the different
ionization/polarity modes was ESI+. ESI2.APCI+. The
number of features detected by ANP LC/MS (Table 1, results
in parentheses) was approximately one/third of that detected by
RP separation.
PCA analyses for LC/MS results (data not shown) indicated
that the pH of the extraction solvent was the largest single
contributor to the variance observed between sample groups, and
corroborated our previously published findings [20]. The extrac￾tion solvent pH, as well as the type of column used: RP or silica
hydride column (ANP mode), both had an impact on the number
of differential features with FC .2 and P,0.05 (Table S1). Pair￾wise t-tests between IRBC and NRBC sample groups revealed 115
differential features from pH 7 solvent extracts that were detected
by RP/ESI+, and as few as 7 differential features in pH 9 solvent

extracts detected by ANP/ESI+. These results were significant
even when accounting for the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Fewer
features, about a third, were detected by APCI+compared to
ESI+, probably due to its lower range of m/z of detection (# m/
z = 300) and the nature of metabolites that can be detected by this
ionization mode.
In summary, regardless of prior data filtering steps, pH 2 and
pH 9 extracts recovered more total features than pH 7 extracts.
However, the pH 7 extracted samples were the most discrimina￾tory between NRBC and IRBCs, with more significantly
differential features (p,0.05) detected than at pH 2 or pH 9.
When differential features were annotated, some of the com￾pounds were found at more than one pH (Figure S2). However, a
significant proportion of compounds were unique to each
extraction pH, illustrating the importance of extraction under all
three pH conditions to maximize metabolite recovery.
Unsupervised Analyses of Metabolite Profiles
Differentiate RBC Infection States
After acquiring and filtering the global metabolite content, we
used the filtered entity lists (CV ,100%) in unsupervised PCA to
classify samples belonging to NRBC or IRBC (Figure S3A and
S3B). PCA analysis suggested a subset of annotated compounds
that could be classified as differentiators of the infected state. PCA
of LC/MS data acquired in ESI+ and ESI2 modes for pH 7
solvent extracted samples clearly differentiated sample groups
based on RBC infection state. For a separate set of samples where
NRBCs and IRBCs were selectively permeabilized by SLO pre￾treatment prior to extraction, only a marginal SLO effect was
observed that was insufficient for classifying the samples (data not
shown). Therefore, to increase the pool size for NRBC and IRBC
groups, the SLO-pre-treated data was combined with SLO￾untreated data, improving the statistical power for differentiating
the two infection state conditions.
Provisional Metabolite Annotation of Untargeted,
Discovery Based Analysis
METLIN database annotation resulted in 171 putatively
annotated metabolites (subsequently referred to as ‘‘annotated
metabolites’’), encompassing non-polar, polar and volatile com￾pounds. A complete list of annotated metabolites, resulting from
MFE and FbF peak finding algorithms for RP/LC-MS data, is
shown in Table S2. 104 annotated metabolites were found and
over half had a METLIN database match to one or more
compounds (i.e. isomers). After accounting for compound redun￾dancies, approximately one quarter of annotated metabolites
revealed a single match to METLIN content, while a fifth of the
total had two annotated matches in the METLIN database. ANP/
LC-MS analysis found 52 annotated metabolites using MFE
analysis (Table S3), and 48 annotated metabolites were matched
using FbF, a targeted mining method based on a database of
empirical formulas. In addition, the identity of a subset of these
annotated metabolites was confirmed by Q-TOF MS/MS and/or
retention time (RT) matching to chemical standards (Table S4).
Highly differential metabolites with an absolute Log2 ratio of
one or greater (:[IRBC/NRBC] Log2:$1, p,0.05) from both
datasets and their associated biological pathways are summarized
in Figure 1. Among the metabolites identified by untargeted
global profiling with a two-fold or greater change (Figure 1) were
several glycolytic intermediates, components of the citric acid
(TCA) cycle and pentose phosphate pathways, the urea cycle,
amino acids and their derivatives. Multiple compounds associated
with purine metabolism were highly differential while only one
intermediate of pyrimidine metabolism was differentially ex￾pressed. Also highly differential were metabolites associated with
CoA, lipid, nicotinamide, ascorbate, folate, and vitamin B6
biosynthesis and metabolism.
Arginine was either undetectable or detected at very low levels
in IRBC samples with IRBC/NRBC Log2 FC = 23.95. Similarly,
inosine and inosine 59-monophosphate (IMP), a key purine
metabolism intermediate, were depleted in IRBC samples. The
identities of urea cycle intermediates, ornithine and citrulline, were
also confirmed and found to be elevated in IRBCs. The results for
arginine and the amino acid derivatives, citrulline and ornithine,
obtained using quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrom￾etry in this study are consistent with previously reported,
quantitative MS/MS analyses using triple quadrupole mass
spectrometry [32,33].
Novel, differentially expressed, annotated metabolites that were
detected in this study included (1) GPGro (18:0/0:0)[U], a glycerol
phosphoglycerol associated with membrane biogenesis in other
organisms; (2) 1-(3-Carboxypropyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine, previ￾ously detected as a metabolite of pentoxifylline, and representative
of plant-derived methylated xanthines such as theophylline and
caffeine; (3) guanosine diphosphofucose and mannitol 1-phos￾phate, intermediates of fructose and mannose metabolism, amino
sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; (4) 1-Hydroxy-2-

D-ribosyl)-AMP. These two ribonucleoside phosphates are
discussed in greater detail below. A few compounds generally
associated with plants or bacteria were also highly differential,
along with some unclassified compounds.
Lipids were highly represented in our dataset and included a
diverse array of compounds including dicarboxylic acids, unsat￾urated fatty acids, straight chain fatty acids, branched fatty acids,
oxo fatty acids, amino fatty acids, octadecanoids, monoacylglycer￾ols, glycerophosphocholines, and sphingolipids (Table S2). These
results reflect highly active de novo fatty-acid synthesis and fatty acid
importation into the P. falciparum- infected erythrocyte. Of
particular note was the very high level of the glyceropho￾sphoglycerol GPGro (18:0/0:0) detected in IRBC only. Sphingo￾sine-1-phosphate and the neutral lipid 1-heptadecanoyl-rac￾glycerol were greatly depleted in IRBCs.
Targeted Data Mining of Compounds Associated with P.
falciparum Infection
A separate, targeted data mining workflow was developed to
complement the untargeted, profiling approach. For this work￾flow, the processed data files were queried with compound
formulas that are specifically associated with an organism’s
metabolic pathways. A Plasmodium-specific Personal Compound
Database (PCD) was constructed from 350 compounds derived
from the Malaria Parasite Metabolic Pathways (MPMP) database
[12]. Elemental compound formulas were used to generate
Extracted Ion Chromatograms (EICs) from the data, which
resulted in 72 matches to the database.
A list of metabolites with MPMP database matches, as well as
their [IRBC/NRBC] Log2 ratios is summarized in Figure 2. The
results for several metabolites found to be differentially abundant
in IRBCs were consistent with our untargeted data mining
approach. This included the glycolytic pathway and compounds
associated with purine and nicotinamide metabolism. However,
some of the metabolites identified by the targeted data mining
strategy had not been detected by the untargeted approach,
including erythrose 4-phosphate (pentose phosphate pathway),
succinic acid (TCA cycle), palmitoyl-CoA, ceramide-phosphatidyl
ethanolamine (PE), and several inositol phosphate metabolic
intermediates. Fatty acyl carnitines and sphingosine-1-phosphate
levels were observed to be significantly reduced in IRBC as
compared to NRBC samples.
Major Metabolite Super Classes and Metabolic Pathways
of P. falciparum-infected RBCs
A local database of malaria-associated metabolites was created
from the compounds in the MPMP database [12]. Based on results
from RP LC/MS analyses, a total of 139 compounds in the
database matched across our data files, corresponding to 124
compounds in IRBCs, and 108 compounds in NRBCs. The super
class distribution of differentially expressed metabolites is summa￾rized in a pie chart to illustrate the full range of metabolites
detected by untargeted and targeted analyses in IRBC and
NRBCs (Figure 3). Super class annotations for all compounds
were based on the HMDB chemical taxonomy [34]. The
compounds fell into 22 super classes, covering a wide range of
metabolites with different physiochemical properties. Amino acids,
purines, pyrimidines and glycolytic intermediates reflected the
largest percentage of differential compounds affected by parasite
infection. In addition, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid,
glycerol lipid and inositol phosphate metabolism were all affected.

which were elevated in IRBC samples relative to NRBC. The
identities of the compounds were subsequently confirmed to be
cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR), and N1-(5-phos￾pho-D-ribosyl)-AMP (pRib-AMP) or acyclic ADPR, respectively.
cADPR is a second messenger involved in the regulation of cellular
Ca2+ homeostasis in eukaryotic cells [35] and has also been
implicated in Plasmodium signaling [36]. pRib-AMP has recently
been shown to be a cADPR phosphohydrolysis product in
mammalian cells via a Mn2+
-dependent ADP ribose/CDP-alcohol
pyrophosphatase [25], raising the possibility that a similar reaction
could occur in P. falciparum. LC/MS analysis of a cADPR standard
revealed an EIC peak for m/z = 540.0538, with m/z and RT
similar to those observed in the samples. Since a commercially
available standard for pRib-AMP was not available, it was
generated by chemical hydrolysis of the cADPR standard that
partially converts it to the derivatized product, pRib-AMP [25].
Based on an EIC for m/z = 558.0644, corresponding to
C15H23N5O14P2, the derivatized solution contained an approx￾imately equimolar mixture of cADPR (Figure 4A) and pRib￾AMP (Figure 4B). The LC/MS spectral scan results based on
EICs and isotope distributions of the cADPR standard and NRBC
sample (Figure S4 A and B), as well as the pRib-AMP standard
and IRBC sample (Figure S4 C and D) strongly suggested that
the compounds in the biological samples corresponded to these
standards.
Q-TOF MS/MS analysis was performed at three collision
energies (10, 20, 40 eV), followed by spectral analysis of the
cADPR standard and its derivatized analogue, pRib-AMP. The
fragmentation patterns of the precursor ion, m/z 558.0644
revealed ions consistent with AMP and N1-phosphoribosyl
fragments of pRib-AMP (Figure 5A). Subsequent extracted
MS/MS spectral comparisons of the m/z 558.0644 precursor
from an IRBC sample (Figure 5B) confirmed the production of a
similar pattern of predominant fragment ions.

In mammalian cells, pRib-AMP is an intermediate in histidine
biosynthesis, and can also be produced as a result of enzymatic
cADPR hydrolysis [25]. Although the presence of pRib-AMP has
not been previously reported in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes,
the concurrent elevation of cADPR, pRib-AMP, and nicotinamide
in these cells suggest the possibility that this hydrolytic pathway
may be utilized by P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (Figure 6).
Arginine Depletion in IRBC
Arginine is efficiently converted to ornithine by the malaria
parasite, resulting in arginine depletion both in vitro and in vivo
[37]. Only two enzymes of this cycle have been previously
described for P. falciparum: carbamoyl-phosphate synthase
(6.3.4.16: PF3D7_1308200); and Arginase (3.5.3.1:
PF3D7_0906500). In our study, greatly reduced levels of arginine
(log2 ratio = 217.76) were detected in IRBC relative to NRBC
(Figure 1). Previously published, quantitative LC/QQQ analyses
of arginine, ornithine and citrulline, show consistency with our
untargeted findings [38]. The depletion of arginine in IRBC
relative to NRBC samples was accompanied by an increase in
ornithine as well as citrulline levels, suggestive of a functional urea
cycle in P. falciparum or production of citrulline from arginine by a
nitric-oxide synthase. These findings illustrate the point that the
metabolomics approach may enable the identification of pathways
that cannot be found by gene homology searches alone.
Glycolysis and Branched TCA Metabolites
Carbohydrate metabolism has been extensively studied in P.
falciparum and certain unique features of central carbon metabo￾lism for this parasite have been noted [39,40]. Due to its
dependence on glucose fermentation for energy [41], the blood￾stage malaria parasite is thought to operate an efficient, yet much
less pronounced central carbon metabolic system. Inclusion of
metabolites related to glycolysis and the TCA cycle in our global
analysis served to confirm the validity of this approach to detect
multiple components of a metabolic pathway during P. falciparum
intra-erythrocytic development.
As a result of its dependence on glycolysis, Plasmodium has a
dampened TCA cycle that is largely dissociated from glycolysis
[40]. Using our PCD of targeted list of compounds, we searched
for several previously identified metabolites that have been
associated with the ‘‘branched TCA cycle’’ (Figure 7) unique
to Plasmodium [39]. TCA-related metabolites identified in this
way were: Acetyl CoA (high in NRBC), glutamate, succinate,
malate, citrate/isocitrate, and aconitate (high in IRBC), and
succinyl-dihydrolipoamide (similar in IRBC & NRBC). GC/MS
analysis detected several hexoses in the samples, including fructose,
galactose (only in IRBC), allose, talose and tagatose (only in
NRBC) (Table S5). Whereas glucose was almost four-fold
depleted in IRBCs, pyruvic acid and lactic acid levels were similar
between NRBC and IRBCs, consistent with the conversion of
pyruvate into lactic acid and efficient export of lactic acid from the
parasite and infected erythrocyte [42].

Global Profiling Results for Annotated Metabolites and P.
falciparum Pathway Mapping
Biological pathway analyses provide a powerful medium with
which to explore and reduce the complexity of large datasets.
Pathway gene enrichment analysis [43] based on transcriptomics
data has previously been shown to be a powerful means for
identifying biochemically active pathways [44]. Utilization of the
Pathway Architect software enabled us to organize numerous
metabolites into canonical pathways. Compared to genes, primary
metabolites represent a relatively sparse matrix. In untargeted
profiling experiments, it is possible to have multiple chemical
formulas that can correspond to the same measured mass. Since
most metabolic pathways contain one or more metabolites and
corresponding chemical formulas that are unique to that metabolic
pathway [45], in silico testing of annotated metabolite enrichment
can be evaluated as a surrogate for experimental identification of
metabolites. Therefore, the metabolite IDs from the list of IRBC
metabolites (Tables S2 and S3) were queried against the
computationally derived set of pathways for the 3D7 isolate of
Plasmodium falciparum (BioCyc, [46]). To investigate global differ￾ences between NRBCs and IRBCs using this pathway approach, a
BioPax formatted file of the Plasmodium pathways was loaded into
the Pathway Architect module and queried. This generated a list
of known pathways in the software, which were most strongly
represented by the input metabolite list (Figure S5). Over 50
distinct pathways with at least one matching entity to BioCyc
content were observed. A number of pathways were impacted or
apparently enriched; most prominently the superpathway for
arginine and polyamine biosynthesis, intermediates of glycolysis,

formula corresponding to the neutral mass, C15H23N5O14P2 corresponds to a compound with a single database entry in METLIN and annotated as N1-

the TCA cycle and nucleotide metabolism. For processes involving
energy production such as glycolysis, almost all of the compounds
matched the annotated metabolite list, revealing significantly
higher enrichment in IRBCs. While many of these pathways were
noted previously during visual inspection of the metabolite list,
some had not been readily discernible, such as the enrichment of
11/46 components of the chorismate superpathway (data not
shown). This pathway overlaps with the shikimate pathway that is
present in apicomplexan parasites but absent in animals [47].
Discussion
This study explored a comprehensive untargeted metabolomics
workflow for Plasmodium falciparum-infected host erythrocytes in cell
culture that has not been previously described. The availability of
accurate mass metabolite databases, a database of computationally
derived list of compounds for Plasmodium falciparum, spectral
libraries and pathway maps were critical to this approach and a
similar strategy may be applied to other infections and disease
states.
Previous studies in our laboratory examined a variety of factors
that contribute to optimization of the analysis of the erythrocyte
metabolome [16] and this served as the basis for the methods used
in this study. Parameters that were examined previously included
extraction solvent composition, mobile phase composition, and
extraction solvent pH. By maximizing detection coverage for non￾polar, polar and volatile compounds in our study, we increased the
probability of matching a subset to annotated metabolite
databases. This was a critical point, since a sparser dataset relying
on only a single extraction solvent and ion/polarity for MS
detection would have yielded less compelling results. Over a
thousand features were detected across all conditions, and over
150 non-redundant compounds were identified. The combined
results for untargeted and targeted metabolite mining were
assigned to a total of 22 metabolite super classes, the largest of
which were related to amino acid metabolism, nucleic acid
metabolism, and glycolysis. While data acquisition and analysis in
an untargeted mode was valuable for detecting a wider range and
larger number of compounds, targeted data mining for known
compounds derived from the Plasmodium literature using the Find
by Formula algorithm was more selective and sensitive. Thus,
these two approaches were complementary for global profiling of
the P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte metabolome.
Previously-defined P. falciparum metabolic pathways and their
components established a framework for applying global LC/MS
based metabolomics to explore this complex host:parasite
relationship. Examples of matches using our inferential pathway
analysis included carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis, pentose
phosphate cycle), purine metabolism, CoA biosynthesis, inositol
phosphate metabolism, nicotinamide metabolism, amino acid
metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and sphingolipid
metabolism. Strikingly, glycolytic pathway intermediates were the
highest abundance species detected in IRBC. In addition,
although one component of the shikimate pathway had been
identified through our targeted data mining approach, a larger
number of compounds associated with the related chorismate
superpathway were identified by pathway analysis of untargeted
data.
In addition to glycolysis, the TCA cycle has been well-studied in
P. falciparum. Although some compounds in this cycle may have

been at low and therefore undetectable levels, we were able to
detect several intermediates that are known to be retained in the
parasite mitochondrion in IRBC: 2-oxoglutarate, S-succinyl
dihydrolipoamide, succinate, and fumarate [39]. In contrast,
intermediates known to be secreted by the parasite (malate,
isocitrate, cis-aconitate, citrate, and oxaloacetate) [39] either were
undetected or were not enhanced in IRBC relative to NRBC. The
reciprocal relationship observed between glutamine and glutamate
in this study is consistent with the efficient importation of
glutamine by the P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte [48] and its
conversion in the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle to glutamate
and 2-oxoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase [39].
Along with accurate mass MS/MS confirmation, the identities
of arginine, citrulline and ornithine were independently validated
and quantified by LC-QQQ mass spectrometry [38]. The results
confirmed depletion of arginine, along with enhancement of
ornithine in infected erythrocytes, consistent with Olszewki et al.
[37]. In our study, however, citrulline levels were also elevated in
infected erythrocytes. Citrulline can be generated from L￾ornithine by ornithine carbamoyltransferase as part of the urea
cycle, or from L-arginine by arginine deaminase, or nitric oxide
synthase. These observations suggest that Plasmodium may possess
one or more enzymes for citrulline production not previously
described for this genus, resulting in a nearly-complete urea cycle.
Purines, particularly hypoxanthine, are essential nutrients that
the intracellular malaria parasite requires for growth and
multiplication. Salvaging purines from the host milieu is an
important physiological requirement for growth and multiplication
of P. falciparum. We detected several purine metabolites including
adenine, adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate,
guanosine diphosphofucose as well as P1,P4-Bis(59-adenosyl)
tetraphosphate. Hypoxanthine was detected in all erythrocyte
extracts, but was not significantly elevated in IRBCs, indicating
that this compound is rapidly consumed during purine biosynthe￾sis.
Depletion of Inosine 59-monophosphate (IMP) was observed in
IRBCs but not in NRBCs. IMP is a key component of purine
biosynthesis, and may be used in the Plasmodium purine salvage
pathway to produce adenylate or guanylate nucleotides [49]. IMP
depletion in IRBCs was accompanied by increases of inositol
phosphate and D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. This pathway
ultimately provides inositol intermediates required for glycosylpho￾sphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, a key post-translational
modification of Plasmodium membrane proteins [50].
Several compounds were differentially expressed which have
not previously been associated with P. falciparum metabolism. Some
of these compounds are associated with metabolic pathways
previously identified in plants and bacteria and may serve as
targets for drug development. One novel finding based on our
discovery approach was the differential elevation of pRib-AMP
and cADPR levels in IRBCs. Both cADPR and pRib-AMP are
adenine-containing nucleotides that have been studied primarily in
mammalian systems. cADPR is a naturally occurring metabolite of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and is an important
signaling molecule that mobilizes endogenous Ca2+ from non￾mitochondrial stores in a variety of mammalian and invertebrate
tissues [35,51–53]. cADPR is of particular interest in malaria
because it is known to regulate the release of intracellular Ca2+
during P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion [54] and to be more
effective than and to work independently of, inositol 1,4,5-
Figure 7. Untargeted, global LC/MS metabolomics analysis for P. falciparum infected RBC cultures reveal metabolites associated

trisphosphate in controlling Ca2+ release in P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes [55]. Differential expression of both cADPR and
pRib-AMP in infected erythrocytes provides independent support
for the role of cADPR in Plasmodium blood stages and raises the
possibility of a novel mechanism for its turnover in parasite￾infected cells. Since Ca2+ signaling controls a critical step in
malaria parasite invasion, components of the cADPR signaling
pathway, as well as mechanisms for its cellular turnover that may
entail its conversion to pRib-AMP are of biological and
pharmacological interest.
In summary, this study illustrates the value of LC/MS profiling
for acquiring and querying metabolomics data of P. falciparum￾infected erythrocytes in an untargeted, discovery-driven approach.
While this manuscript was in review, Lakshmanan et al published
an untargeted LC/MS study [56], to show evidence for
intermediates of a plant-like a-linoleic acid pathway in patient
plasma and in vitro cultured RBCs. Although their strategy was
less comprehensive and yielded fewer total metabolites than we
report here, it underscores the significance of the untargeted
approach in discovery metabolomics. It should be noted that
among the metabolites detected in our study were several of the a￾linoleic acid pathway metabolites described in their study,
including methyl jasmonate and traumatic acid (dodecanedioic
acid). While these metabolites were differentially expressed in
IRBCs, they were not as highly differential as some of the other
compounds examined.
Screening of the Plasmodium genome for orthologous genes with
sequence homology to defined enzymes for several of these
pathways in other species or alternative approaches for identifi￾cation of analogous genes will be an important next step.
Techniques such as activity-based metabolomic profiling [57]
may subsequently be used to determine whether Plasmodium gene
orthologs possess the expected enzymatic function. It should be
noted that 50% of the chemical features detected could not be
matched to the existing METLIN database, and alternative
strategies for identification of these compounds are needed. This
study shows the tremendous potential of a global mass spectrom￾etry-based platform to expand the universe of defined Plasmodium
metabolites and identify potentially novel metabolic pathways of
this important human pathogen.
