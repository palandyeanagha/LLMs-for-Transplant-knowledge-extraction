Abstract
The prevalence of kidney diseases is emerging as a public health problem. Stem cells (SCs), currently considered as
a promising tool for therapeutic application, have aroused considerable interest and expectations. With self-renewal
capabilities and great potential for proliferation and differentiation, stem cell therapy opens new avenues for the
development of renal function and structural repair in kidney diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that stem cells
exert a therapeutic effect mainly by replacing damaged tissues and paracrine pathways. The benefits of various
types of SCs in acute kidney disease and chronic kidney disease have been demonstrated in preclinical studies, and
preliminary results of clinical trials present its safety and tolerability. This review will focus on the stem cell-based
therapy approaches for the treatment of kidney diseases, including various cell sources used, possible mechanisms
involved, and outcomes that are generated so far, along with prospects and challenges in clinical application.

Introduction
Kidney diseases have become a global public health
problem due to their rapidly growing incidence. These
diseases affect over 10% of the global population, be￾cause of a global rise in the aging population, as well as
increase in the frequency of their main etiologies, such
as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension [1,
2]. As a routine treatment for kidney diseases, multidrug
therapy cannot reverse the process of entering into end￾stage renal disease (ESRD) in most of the patients, and
those with ESRD require renal replacement therapy, i.e.,
maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation [3].
Owing to high medical costs and adverse impacts on the
patient’s quality of life, dialysis is not considered as an
ideal treatment strategy [4, 5]. Kidney transplantation
enables patients to regain their own renal function;
however, severe shortage of organ donors and potential
organ rejection limited its use. Consequently, exploring
novel and better therapeutic options to alleviate, cure, or
prevent renal diseases and to improve patients’ survival
and quality of life is mandatory.
Stem cells (SCs) are described by their self-renewal
abilities and the capability to develop into various func￾tional cells under certain conditions. Based on the ad￾vantages of plasticity, infinite amplification, and ease of
genetic manipulation, stem cell therapy opens new ave￾nues for almost all human diseases. The application of
SC therapy in treating a variety of diseases such as im￾munological, vascular, cardiac, and renal diseases has
been extensively explored [6, 7]. The use of SCs is a
promising therapeutic strategy for kidney diseases as
well. Increasing results obtained in models of acute kid￾ney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
document that SCs have therapeutic potential in repair
of renal injury, preserving renal function and structure
thus prolonging animal survival. The effects were ini￾tially attributed to SCs implanting damaged tissue,

differentiating, and replacing damaged cells [8]. The sub￾sequent evidence suggests that SCs also act through the
secretion of bioactive paracrine factors and/or release of
microvesicles with immunomodulatory and proregenera￾tive properties [9, 10]. Additionally, stem cells could be di￾rected to differentiate into kidney lineage cells and
generate into kidney organoids, which are expected to be
used for disease modeling and drug discovery, and may
eventually be applicable for transplantation [11]. In view
of the great potential application of SCs in kidney diseases,
the need to better understand on how to develop cell￾based experimental treatments, and how to implement
them in clinical trials, becomes more pressing. In this re￾view, an overview of characteristics of different types of
stem cells, the current available evidence from preclinical/
clinical studies on cell-based therapy for kidney diseases,
and discussion of prospects and challenges of its applica￾tion in the treatment of kidney diseases were provided.
Potential sources of stem cells for cell-based
therapy in kidney diseases
Before we go into further details regarding the current
SC-based approaches, a brief summary of the back￾ground information regarding potential sources of stem
cells has to be put forward. SCs are self-renewable cells
that are capable of differentiating into specialized cell
types under appropriate conditions, and could be divided
into four categories according to their differentiation po￾tential (Fig. 1).
With the greatest differentiation potential, totipotent stem
cells (TSCs) possess the omnipotentiality to differentiate
into any type of cells, including the extraembryonic lineages
and the germline [12, 13]. The zygote and the blastomeres
of the early embryo are considered to be totipotent [14, 15].
Providing tools and models for exploring the underlying
molecular mechanisms of cell potency, somatic cell nuclear
transfer (SCNT) is currently the only way to generate a toti￾potent cell in vitro, which involved the physical transplant￾ation of a somatic nucleus into an enucleated oocyte. Due
to its association with low success rate and requirement of
oocytes, there are both scientific and ethical considerations
which hold back the broader practical use of this technology
in stem cell therapy [16, 17]. But understanding TSCs helps
us to understand the molecular mechanisms behind main￾tenance and manipulation of cell fate and is essential to
understand how pluripotent cells form in vivo.
Pluripotency refers to a stem cell with potential to dif￾ferentiate into any of the three germ lineages: endoderm
(interior stomach lining, gastrointestinal tract, the lungs),
mesoderm (muscle, bone, blood, urogenital), or ecto￾derm (epidermal tissues and nervous system) [18]. Pluri￾potent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of giving rise to all

cells of any tissue types except for extraembryonic cells
and mainly include embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in￾duced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). ESCs are harvested
from the inner cell mass of blastocysts and are consid￾ered as the initial candidates of cell therapy [18, 19].
However, the clinical use of ESCs generated from sur￾plus embryos has some problems, including bioethical
debate, immunological rejections, and the risk of tera￾toma. One way to circumvent these issues is by generat￾ing PSCs directly from the patients’ own cells. Induced
pluripotent stem cells are reprogrammed somatic cells
that regain pluripotency by inducing a “forced” overex￾pression of certain transcription factors. iPSCs share
many similarities with ESCs in terms of morphology,
proliferation, surface markers, gene expression, epigen￾etic status, etc., and a less risk of immune rejection than
ESCs. They are considered to be a potential source for
renal generation and promising cell source for patients
requiring specific cell therapy.
Adult SCs that exist in the postnatal organisms are ei￾ther multipotent or unipotent and are restricted to a
limited range of cell types if iPSCs were not taken into
consideration. Multipotent SCs, including hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) [20], mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
[21], neural stem cells (NSCs) [22], and intestinal stem
cells (ISCs) [23], can differentiate into several cell types
of confined cell lineages. The MSCs, which are also
known as the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), can
differentiate into cells of mesenchymal cell lineages such
as osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, and poten￾tially other cell types [21]. In addition, MSCs were iso￾lated virtually from any type of tissues, including the
bone marrow stroma, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord
blood. It has been hypothesized that MSCs contribute to
tissue repair by differentiating into organ-specific cells
and replacement of damaged tissues. Recently, a body of
studies has confirmed that MSCs act through paracrine/
endocrine secretion of bioactive factors and exosomes.
MSCs secrete a variety of molecules including cytokines,
growth factors, anti-oxidants and pro-angiogenic factors,
and those that stimulate cell proliferation and angiogen￾esis, decrease the response to stress and apoptosis of
damaged cells, and regulate the local and systemic in￾flammatory and immune response, thus contributing to
tissue repair [24, 25]. The application of MSCs in treat￾ing kidney diseases is widely studied and is superior to
the application of other SCs.
Progenitor cells exhibit differentiation potential be￾tween SCs and mature cells and were found in many or￾gans, including the bone marrow [26], gastrointestinal
mucosa [27], liver, brain, prostate, and skin. These cells
play a part in maintaining the wounding process to re￾place the damaged or dead cells, participating in the
normal cell turnover of organs. Whether or not adult
kidney SCs exist has been an unsettled controversy to
date, but current research has confirmed that the adult
mammalian kidney contains multiple cells with self￾renewability and differentiation potential, which are
known as the renal stem/progenitor cells (RSPCs) [28–
32]. With inherent renal differentiation potential and the
potential for autologous treatments, RSPCs were consid￾ered to be ideal sources of cell therapy for treating kid￾ney diseases.
Embryonic stem cells
ESCs that are characterized by features of self￾renewability and multilineage differentiation hold great
promise in cell therapy and kidney regeneration. Numer￾ous studies have shown that mouse embryonic stem cells
(mESCs) can integrate into kidney compartments, sug￾gesting a possible efficacy for kidney repair. In addition,
the exposure of ESCs to factors required for renal speci￾fication, such as retinoic acid, activin A, and bone mor￾phogenic proteins (BMPs), induces differentiation of
these cells into renal lineage cells in vitro [33–35].
Geng et al. have reported that the ESC-loaded gelatin
microcryogels on 5/6 nephrectomized rats slowed down
the progression of chronic kidney disease and reduced
glomerular injury [36]. Similarly, mESC implantation in
mice with renal failure induction (RFI) employing cis￾platin significantly decreased the mortality, avoiding a
greater histological deterioration related to the disease.
Glomerulosclerosis or collapsed glomeruli were not ob￾served in RFI mice treated with mESCs; even some re￾generation data were found characterized by large nuclei
with prominent [37]. Mata-Miranda et al. suggested the
beneficial effects of mESCs on AKI were related to the
reduction of lipid peroxidation [38].
Patients require renal replacement therapy when their
kidney disease progresses to ESRD. Although dialysis of￾fers a temporary solution for patients, it has several limi￾tations. Dialysis does not address the loss of hemostatic
and endocrine function of the kidney and its associated
complications [5]. Kidney transplantation remains to be
the best curative treatment strategy to restore total kid￾ney function, but the demand for organs suitable for
transplantation has reached a level that far outstrips the
static supply [39]. Due to the precise nature of renal
structure, which comprises several kinds of cells and
with complex anatomy, the kidney has become the most
difficult organs of reconstruction. Many protocols have
induced the differentiation of ESCs to generate complex
structures resembling kidneys, termed organoids, which
contain multiple renal cell types and are capable of self￾organization.
Morizane et al. have successfully induced differenti￾ation of ESCs into nephron progenitor cells (NPCs),
which were then transformed into self-organized
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 3 of 20

nephron-like structures containing glomeruli, proximal
tubules, loop of Henle, and distal tubules in a contigu￾ous, ordered arrangement that are analogous to that of
nephrons [40]. Takasato and colleagues have generated
kidney organoids that contain not only nephrons and
collecting duct but also renal interstitium and an endo￾thelial network. The proximal tubules of these show
functional maturity to some extent [41]. The ESC￾derived kidney progenitors implanted into immunocom￾promised mice generated perfused glomeruli containing
human capillaries, podocytes with regions of mature
basement membrane, and mesangial cells. The vascular￾ized glomeruli showed the ability to produce ultrafiltrate
that is processed by adjacent tubules [42]. The latest re￾search is consistent with previous ones. By inducing the
directional differentiation of ESCs into ureteric bud pro￾genitor cells and co-culturing with dissociated primary
metanephric mesenchyme (pMM), the organoids com￾posed of nephron structures and collecting ducts could
be produced, which displayed the presence of endothe￾lial cells forming a vascular network [43].
Although scientists thought they have found a strategy
to isolate hESCs from single blastomeres without
destroying the embryos, legal and ethical controversies
still limit the research and applications of ESCs [44]. An￾other concern about this technique is that cells and tis￾sues derived from ESCs are at high risk of degenerating
into neoplasms, especially teratomas. Yamamoto et al.
demonstrated that ESCs can develop teratoma 14 days
and 28 days after transplantation into mouse [45]. What
is more, ESC-derived differentiated cells are allogenic in
nature and inevitably suffer from all the issues related to
allografts and immunocompatibility, such as acute and
chronic rejection, and graft versus host disease.
Induced pluripotent stem cells
Induced pluripotent stem cells sharing many of the re￾generative properties of ESCs are considered effective al￾ternative cell sources for ESCs. Indeed, iPSCs could
retain both genetic background and peculiar epigenetic
memory of the cells of origin, providing indisputable ad￾vantages in cell therapy, kidney regeneration, and other
biomedical applications.
According to the earliest report on iPSCs put forward
in 2006, scientists obtained PSCs by introducing four
transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC)
into mouse adult fibroblasts, and this technique has
earned Shinya Yamanaka and John Gurdon the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012 [34]. To date, the
human iPSCs have been generated from multiple
sources, including skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes [46, 47],
extraembryonic tissues [48], cord blood [49], peripheral
blood cells [50], hepatocytes, stomach cells [51], dental
pulp cells [52], and even fully differentiated lymphocytes
(such as T and B cells) [53]. Interestingly, the terminally
differentiated kidney cells are reprogrammed to pluripo￾tency. Song et al. have reprogrammed normal human
mesangial cells to pluripotency by retroviral transduction
using defined factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). The
kidney-derived iPSCs resemble that of human embryonic
stem cell-like colonies in morphology and gene expres￾sion. They were considered as alkaline phosphatase￾positive; express OCT3/4, TRA-1 to 60, and TRA-1 to
81 proteins; and form embryoid bodies and express
markers of all three germ layers [54]. iPSCs were gener￾ated from human renal proximal tubular cells as well.
Considering their potential risks as oncogenes Klf4 and
c-Myc, Montserrat et al. have generated iPSCs with only
two transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, by using a sin￾gle tricistronic vector and without any need of other
additional chemical compounds [55]. Moreover, gener￾ation of iPSCs from exfoliated renal tubular cells that
are present in urine is regarded as a simple, non-invasive
method for obtaining iPSCs [56–58]. Indeed, iPSCs
could retain both genetic background and peculiar epi￾genetic memory of the cells of origin, providing indis￾putable advantages in cell therapy, kidney regeneration,
and other biomedical applications.
Induced pluripotent stem cells are considered as an ef￾fective means to alleviate renal tissue damaged in AKI
and CKD, and paracrine pathways may be the major
mechanism. The administration of iPSC-derived condi￾tioned medium attenuated AKI by downregulating the
oxidative stress response in ischemia-reperfusion rats
[59]. The recent result from Collino et al. suggested that
iPSC-derived extracellular vesicles contributed to the re￾duction of macrophage infiltration and protected func￾tional mitochondria and regulated several genes
associated with oxidative stress, promoting the renopro￾tection of AKI rats [60]. In the study conducted by Lee
et al., the cell transplantation of iPSCs showed improve￾ment of renal function after AKI and dramatically re￾duced the mortality associated with AKI, exhibiting anti￾oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic
effects. It is worth noting that high doses of iPSC accu￾mulation might lead to renal dysfunction. In the same
research, Lee et al. have found that injection with 5 × 107
iPSCs affected the smaller arteries of the kidneys with
cellular emboli, leading to the reduction of blood reper￾fusion after ischemia. When carrying out cell therapy for
treatment of AKI using iPSCs, the cell dose for trans￾plantation and the monitoring of renal blood perfusion
should be taken care of [61]. For the efficacy of iPSC
therapy in chronic kidney disease, Caldas et al. have
compared the therapeutic effects of iPSCs and bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs)
on the progression of CKD in untreated 5/6 nephrecto￾mized rats. It was shown that both treatments improved
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 4 of 20

function and structure of the kidney. Injection of iPSCs
decreased the macrophage infiltration, and TGF-β was
reduced in the kidneys in the BMSC group, suggesting
an anti-inflammatory response that led to decreased fi￾brosis. In particularly, proteinuria was reduced only in
the iPSC group. However, 5/8 (62.5%) rats treated with
iPSCs presented tumors confirmed by histology, the cells
are positively stained by PCNA, and Wilms’ tumor pro￾tein antibody has the characteristics of Wilms’ tumor.
These results indicated the effect of iPSCs on retarding
progression of CKD and potential risk of Wilms’ tumor
development [62].
The pluripotency of PSCs raises concerns on high risk
of maldifferentiation of the cells and even tumor forma￾tion, when these cells are administered without pre￾differentiation. An attractive alternative consists in the
derivation of renal progenitors from iPSCs, which could
be achieved by the controlled activation of the correct
network of nephric transcription factors. The injected
iPSC-derived renal progenitor cells robustly engrafted
into damaged tubuli and restored renal function and
structure in cisplatin mice with AKI [63]. Similarly,
iPSC-derived MSC therapy effectively protected the rat
kidney from acute ischemia-reperfusion injury [64]. And
iPSC-derived MSCs showed comparable effects in the
repair of AKI as compared to adult MSCs [65]. In CKD
rat models, the administration of iPSC-derived MSCs se￾lectively mobilized into kidney parenchyma and pre￾served residual renal function via suppression of the
inflammatory reaction, inhibiting apoptosis and regulat￾ing cell proliferative/death signaling. All the studies
above demonstrate that iPSCs are a valuable source of
engraftable cells with regenerative activity for kidney dis￾ease and create the basis for future applications in stem
cell-based therapy [66].
Induced pluripotent stem cells are regarded as the best
source for producing new kidney tissues for transplant￾ation, which are potentially derived from patients and
used as a renal replacement therapy without immuno￾suppression. Although it is difficult to regenerate the en￾tire kidney in vitro, recent advances in the field of SCs
have enabled in vitro generation of organoids [67–73].
The kidney organoid formation involves stimulation of
a stepwise differentiation process, in which movement
occurs from monolayered iPSCs to primitive streak then
intermediate mesoderm to kidney lineage cells [40, 69–
71, 74]. Several protocols for differentiation of PSCs to
kidney cell fates have been established to date. In the
early days, several studies have reported successful dif￾ferentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)
into either ureteric epithelium [35, 73, 75] or metaneph￾ric mesenchyme [35, 72, 76] in vitro. Takasato et al. have
put forward a detailed protocol of inducing human in￾duced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate
complex multicellular kidney organoid within which seg￾mented nephrons are connected to the collecting ducts
and are surrounded by renal interstitial cells and an
endothelial network. The kidney organoid reported is
transcriptionally similar to that of fetal human kidneys
and showed functional maturity, in which the proximal
tubules within the organoids displayed megalin￾mediated and cubilin-mediated endocytosis, and
responded to a nephrotoxicant to undergo apoptosis
[70].
Bioengineering represents one possible approach for
generating the complex branching structures of the kid￾ney. Scaffolds are temporary physical support obtained
from a variety of biomaterials and help to accommodate
cells and support their three-dimensional (3D) growth
during tissue developmental stage [77]. Scaffolds have
become a hope for clinical translation due to their fea￾tures of biocompatibility, biochemical and biological
cues for cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differen￾tiation, and continued function [78, 79]. Renal scaffolds
were successfully produced from porcine, rat, and hu￾man kidneys [80–84]. Considering as a potent cell
source for scaffold recellularization, embryonic stem
cells and adipose tissue-derived stem cells have been
seeded into renal scaffolds, achieving cell adherence,
proliferation, differentiation, endothelialization, and
vascularization [84–87]. Du et al. have first attempted to
repopulate a kidney scaffold using hiPSC-derived endo￾thelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) [88]. Ciampi et al. have repopu￾lated acellular rat kidney scaffolds by using hiPSC-ECs
that properly integrate into kidney structures, forming
vessel-like structures [89]. It has been reported that hu￾man whole kidney scaffold re-endothelialization can be
done using hiPSC-ECs and fully perfused with human
whole blood [84]. Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip technol￾ogy has been used to construct an in vitro model of hu￾man kidney glomerulus. Musah et al. have reconstituted
kidney glomerular capillary function in vitro through
microfluidic organ-on-a-chip device. The hiPSC-derived
podocytes were cultured on the top of the laminin￾coated membrane and primary human glomerular endo￾thelial cells on the opposite side of the same membrane
to recapitulate the podocyte-GBM-endothelial interface.
The microfluidic glomerulus chip recapitulates some of
the normal molecular filtration properties of the func￾tional human kidney glomerular capillary wall and then
replicates pharmacologically induced podocyte injury
and albuminuria as seen in patients [90, 91].
Although not yet clinically available for transplant￾ation, hiPSC-derived kidney organoids provide dominant
models for studying the pathophysiology of kidney dis￾eases, through which we can better understand gene
mutations and disease phenotypes of the disease, mim￾icking disease progression. Preserving the naturally
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 5 of 20

occurring genetic mutations as well as the genetic back￾ground of their parental somatic cells, hiPSCs can be ap￾plicable to disease/patient-specific modeling. Genetically
characterized hiPSCs have been efficiently derived from
patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney dis￾ease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD),
Alport syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
Wilms’ tumor and patients undergoing hemodialysis [58,
92–97]. In addition, mouse models commonly used in
previous studies could not fully recapitulate human ge￾notypes and phenotypes [98, 99]. For example, KAL-1
encodes a basement membrane protein called anosmin-1
that is present on the surface of ureteric bud (UB). The
mouse lacking KAL-1 and humans with KAL-1 muta￾tions have renal agenesis, absence of kidneys and ureters
[100]. Another case is that the autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease in humans often inherits het￾erozygous loss-of-function mutations in either PKD1
(polycystic kidney disease-1) or PKD2 (polycystic kidney
disease-2), while the mice displays only very mild cystic
disease in the same situation [101, 102]. Species-specific
models developed by hiPSCs that carry naturally occur￾ring human mutations are regarded as important com￾plement to mouse models, showing a great promise in
studying kidney development and disease process.
Recently, gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/
Cas9 make it possible to treat inherited kidney diseases
by correcting the pathogenic mutation in an iPSC line.
For example, a family with adult-onset autosomal dom￾inant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was re￾cently found to carry a new germline missense
heterozygous mutation (p.G189R) in the octapeptide do￾main of the transcription factor PAX2 [103]. Trionfini
et al. efficiently corrected this point mutation in patient￾derived iPSCs by means of CRISPR-Cas9-based
homology-directed repair. Forbes et al. corrected the
mutations in IFT140 of iPSCs derived from a patient
with nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy and induced
the isogenic gene-corrected iPSCs differentiated to kid￾ney organoids. Proband organoid tubules demonstrated
shortened, club-shaped primary cilia, whereas gene cor￾rection rescued this phenotype [104]. Likewise, genetic
correction of the single amino acid mutation of iPSCs
generated from a congenital nephrotic syndrome patient
due to NPHS1 mutations has restored nephrin
localization and phosphorylation and slit diaphragm for￾mation [74].
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells
Besides the therapies based on HSCs, MSC-based ther￾apies are currently the most advanced SC-based therap￾ies in terms of clinical testing. Firstly, MSCs can be
readily expanded in culture, generating a large number
of therapeutic doses. Secondly, MSCs do not express
blood group, DR antigens, and costimulatory CD40,
CD80, and CD86 proteins to render them hypoimmuno￾genic, thus facilitating their safe use in allogeneic off￾the-shelf protocols [105]. Accumulating pieces of evi￾dence have indicated tremendous treatment potential of
MSCs in kidney diseases, including AKI, CKD, diabetic
nephropathy (DN), lupus nephritis (LN), polycystic kid￾ney disease (PKD), and renovascular disease (RVD). Al￾though a uniform mechanism governing the MSC-based
therapy has not yet been discovered, available data have
revealed several working models that promoted their use
(Fig. 2).
The priority of MSCs to traffic to the sites of ischemia,
hypoxia, and inflammatory response following injury
plays a crucial role in the success of these as cellular
therapy for organ injuries. MSC homing is defined as the
arrest of MSCs within the vasculature of a tissue
followed by transmigration across the endothelium
[106–108]. The homing of MSCs to the injured tissues
has been driven by a combination of chemokine release
from the injured tissue and chemokine receptors that
are expressed by MSCs [109]. The stromal derived
factor-1 (SDF-1)/chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4
(CXCR4) axis plays a crucial role in the migration of
MSCs. Overexpression of CXCR4 gene enhances BM￾MSC migration to the kidney area and functional repair
after AKI [110]. CD44-hyaluronic acid (CD44-HA) inter￾actions are involved in the process of homing of MSCs
to the damaged renal tissue and promote renal function
repair following acute tubular injury and chronic renal
failure [111]. Due to their vitality in enhancing the
kidney-directional migration of transplanted MSCs for
increasing the efficiency of tissue repair, some novel pre￾conditioning strategies were explored, including incuba￾tion with cytokines or chemical compounds [112–114],
co-injection [115, 116], hypoxia stimulation [117], and
genetic modifications [118, 119]. Also, pulse-focused
ultrasound (pFUS) has elicited local molecular responses
through mechanotransduction, thus enhancing the renal
homing of circulating MSCs [120–122].
Treatment with intravenous injection of MSCs has ef￾ficiently induced improvement of the repaired kidney
both morphologically and functionally. Therapeutic
properties of MSCs were originally derived from their
engraftment in the injured kidney and subsequent trans￾differentiation of MSCs into renal-specific cells to re￾populate the kidney. The possible role of MSCs in
response to kidney injury was first observed when the fe￾male kidney transplants were transferred into male re￾cipients, in which the Y chromosome staining of tubular
epithelial cells was found [123, 124]. Several studies have
shown that intravenous injection of MSCs homed to the
repaired kidney site and localized in the context of tubu￾lar epithelial lining and expressed the epithelial markers,
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 6 of 20

indicating engraftment of MSCs [8, 109, 125, 126]. Al￾though MSCs home to the injured sites of kidney via
blood circulation after transplantation, the renal MSC
engraftment was scarce and transient. Most of injected
MSCs remain in other blood-rich organs, such as the
lung, liver, and spleen. The numbers of MSC-derived
epithelial cells appear to be so low to explain tissue re￾covery or wound healing (≤ 0.1%), and the hypothesis
could not explain the rapid protective effect of injected
MSCs which occurred within 24–48 h as well. All these
facts suggest that the effects of MSCs may be mediated
by another mechanism. The research conducted by
Tögel et al. has made a breakthrough in this field. The
study reported that differentiation of rat BM-MSCs into
a tubular or endothelial cell phenotype was not observed
in an ischemic/reperfusion experimental model of AKI.
But the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β,
TNF-α, IFN-γ, and inducible nitric oxide synthase
showed significant reduction, and that of anti￾inflammatory factors IL-10 and bFGF, TGF-α, and Bcl-2
was highly upregulated in the treated kidneys [127].
These studies showed consistent results, in which MSC￾conditioned media improved the survival of human
proximal tubular cells when exposed to cisplatin in vitro
[10, 128, 129]. Now, there is a growing consensus that
kidney-protective effects of MSCs are primarily exerted
by their paracrine function rather than by direct
engraftment.
MSCs secrete a broad repertoire of cytokines, chemo￾kines, and growth factors, including IL-6 and IL-11, vas￾cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), granulocyte￾colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage-colony
stimulating factor (M-CSF), basic fibroblast growth fac￾tor (bFGF), monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP￾1), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF), and hepatocyte growth HGF [10, 130–133].
These contribute in renal protection by promoting pro￾liferation of epithelial cells and angiogenesis, anti￾apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, and other sig￾naling pathways [10, 134–136]. Moreover, accumulating
evidence also underlined the paracrine actions mediated
by extracellular vesicles (EVs), small anuclear

membrane-bound particles released from MSCs as a
paracrine vehicle to deliver messenger RNA (mRNA),
microRNAs, proteins, or bioactive lipids that may repro￾gram the injured cells or induce secretion of cytoprotec￾tive factors [137, 138]. The EVs mainly include
exosomes (30–100 nm) that are formed from multivesi￾cular bodies through inward budding of endosome
membrane [139] and microvesicles (100–1000 nm) that
are released from the cell by outward budding of plasma
membrane [140]. Indeed, it has been shown that MSC￾derived EVs (MSC-EVs) accelerate renal repair in acute
kidney injury (AKI) models. Bruno et al. have demon￾strated the protective effects of MSC-EVs in tubular epi￾thelial cells of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice in glycerol-induced AKI. RNase treatment abro￾gated the protective effects, suggesting an RNA￾dependent mechanism and the occurrence of horizontal
transfer of human mRNAs in MSC-EVs to target cells
[141]. Similar results were obtained by Gatti et al. [142]
and Zou et al. [143]. Injections of MSC-EVs reduced the
progression of renal injury in experimental models of
CKD that was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy [144] and
unilateral ureteral obstruction [145, 146]. Eirin and his
colleagues have tested the therapeutic effects of EVs in a
porcine model with coexistence of RVD and metabolic
syndrome. Intrarenal delivery of MSC-EVs attenuated
renal inflammation; improved medullary oxygenation
and fibrosis; decreased renal vein levels of several pro￾inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL￾1-β; and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10
[135]. Moreover, MSC-derived EVs inhibited and
reverted fibrosis progression in a diabetic nephropathy
mouse model by downregulating fibrosis-related genes
[147].
Rather than being a constant mixture of molecular fac￾tors, MSCs’ secretome is known to be dependent on the
diverse stimuli present in the microenvironment that
MSCs encounter. The crosstalk and interplay of MSCs
and local environment reversely control and regulate the
paracrine activity of MSCs. MSC growth conditions such
as oxygen tension, growth factor composition, and
mechanical properties may serve to directly influence
paracrine activity [148, 149]. Daniëlle et al. cultured hu￾man bone marrow and kidney perivascular stromal cells
in the TopoWell plate, a custom-fabricated multiwell
plate containing 76 unique bioactive surface topograph￾ies. Then, they compared the 76 different surface topog￾raphies in growth factor and cytokine expression profile;
major differences can be observed between secretion
levels between topographies of several growth factor and
cytokine levels, such as HGF, SDF1α, and
trombospondin-I, while others showed a more stable se￾cretion such as VEGF [150]. As the paracrine of MSCs is
affected by microenvironment structure, the therapeutic
potential of their secretome can be manipulated in an
engineered setting. For example, BM-MSCs precondi￾tioned with melatonin express a higher level of catalase
and SOD-1 expression and overexpression of basic fibro￾blast growth factor (bFGF) and HGF. And more surviv￾ing grafted MSCs, overstimulation of angiogenesis and
proliferation in renal cells, and more rapid renal func￾tion recovery were observed in I/R-AKI rats which re￾ceived the BM-MSCs preconditioned with melatonin
[151].
MSCs comprise immunomodulatory and tolerogenic
properties. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have
demonstrated that MSCs are capable of suppressing T
cell proliferation, influencing dendritic cell maturation
and function, suppressing B cell proliferation and ter￾minal differentiation, and modulating other immune
cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages.
Besides, MSCs also induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
maintain the capability of Tregs to suppress self-reactive
T-effector responses [152]. The immunosuppressive cap￾acity of MSCs allows them to act as a potential thera￾peutic target in renal transplantation as they may inhibit
allograft rejection and induce transplant tolerance [153,
154]. On the other hand, immunological properties of
MSCs suggest a potential treatment for autoimmune dis￾eases, such as lupus nephritis characterized by autoanti￾body production and immune complex formation/
deposition in glomeruli. A significant reduction in the
levels of anti-dsDNA and anti-nuclear autoantibodies,
immunoglobulin IgG, IgM, and serum albumin was ob￾served in SLE mice after BM-MSC therapy. And BM￾MSC transplantation effectively prevented damage to
glomerular morphology/structure and reduced renal
complex deposition of both complement component 3
(C3) and IgG [155]. The study conducted by Jang et al.
showed that the infusion of BM-MSCs suppressed
glomerulonephritis, decreased autoantibody produc￾tion, reduced proteinuria, and improved overall sur￾vival in SLE mice via inhibition of follicular helper
cell (Tfh) development and activation of humoral im￾munity [156]. Dental tissue-derived MSCs are also ef￾fective in reducing kidney glomerular lesion and
perivascular inflammation infiltration [157]. However,
some studies failed to show a positive effect of the
treatment with MSCs, and for some aspects, even
deleterious results seem to be observed [158].
Despite promising preclinical results obtained in ani￾mal models, which indicated effectiveness of MSCs in
reducing acute and chronic kidney injuries, clinical trials
still remained in the early phases and largely aimed to
investigate the safety and efficacy of MSC infusion. To
date, more than 40 clinical trials were conducted world￾wide, completed or ongoing, involving the use of MSCs
in the treatment of kidney diseases as reported by the
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 8 of 20

US National Institute of Health database (ClinicalTrials.
gov).
According to the clinical study conducted by Gooch
et al., infusion of allogenic MSCs into patients with high
risk of AKI after undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery
demonstrated no adverse events (AEs) or severe adverse
events (SAEs). Moreover, MSC infusion prevented post￾operative renal failure (0% versus 20% AKI incidence
when compared to case controls) and the length of hos￾pital stay and readmission rates were reduced by 40%
[159, 160]. A recent phase 2, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial conducted by Swaminathan
et al. drew inconsistent conclusions to those stated
above. No significant difference was observed in the time
to recovery of kidney function after treatment of early
postoperative AKI with allogeneic MSCs when com￾pared to those treated with placebo [161]. The absence
of a significant recovery signal after AKI in patients
treated with MSCs might be attributable to several fac￾tors. Longer durations of median cardiopulmonary by￾pass (CPB) time in the MSC group might have masked a
beneficial effect. Many patients in this study had im￾paired kidney function before surgery, and in the setting
of already compromised kidney function, beneficial ef￾fects of MSCs could be attenuated. What is more, the
complexity of postcardiac surgery clinical setting and
postoperative course might hinder the ability to observe
a modest clinical effect with MSCs or other agents.
Although clinical translation of MSC-based therapeu￾tics for human CKD is still in an early phase, it has dem￾onstrated the potential to modify the progression of
CKD. A single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled,
phase II/III clinical pilot study investigated the safety
and therapeutic efficacy of MSC-derived EVs in CKD
patient stage III and IV after following up for a period of
12 months. Although kidney biopsy specimens that are
obtained 3 months after the therapy showed no signifi￾cant histologic changes, EV treatment exhibited a signifi￾cant improvement in renal function (improved eGFR
and decreased serum creatinine, BUN, and albuminuria)
[162]. A multicenter, randomized study demonstrated
the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cell
(MPC) infusion in diabetic nephropathy. DN patients
with eGFR of 20–50 ml/min/1.73 m2 were treated with a
single intravenous infusion of two doses of allogenic
MPC or placebo. Relative to placebo, a single IV
rexlemestrocel-L infusion showed trends of stabilizing or
improving eGFR and measured glomerular filtration rate
(mGFR) at the prespecified primary endpoint 12 weeks
post-infusion, particularly for those with higher baseline
eGFR (> 30 ml/min/1.73/m2) and higher serum IL-6
concentration (> 3.5 pg/dl) [163]. In another pilot study,
the treatment of autologous adipose tissue-derived
MSCs (AT-MSCs) significantly reduced urinary protein
excretion of CKD patients, from a median of 0.75 g/day
(range, 0.15–9.57) at baseline to 0.54 g/day (range,
0.01v2.66) at month 12. But no improvement in glom￾erular filtration rate has been observed [164]. Similarly,
another 18-month study showed no significant improve￾ments in renal function of CKD patients who received
MSC infusion [165]. Saad et al. have reported that intra￾arterial infusion of autologous MSCs in patients with
RVD showed increased cortical perfusion and renal
blood flow (RBF) and reduced renal tissue hypoxia
within post-stenotic kidney [166]. The safety and toler￾ability of a single BM-MSC intravenous infusion in
ADPKD patients were observed [167].
The safety and tolerability of MSCs in patients with
LN have also been described. Numerous clinical studies
have shown that allogeneic MSC transplantation in pa￾tients with SLE resulted in the amelioration of disease
activity, improvement in serological markers, and
stabilization of renal function [168–171]. A single-center
study involving 81 Chinese patients with active and re￾fractory LN reported that 60.5% (49/81) patients have
achieved renal remission during 12-month visit by hu￾man umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell
(hUC-MSC) transplantation, and 11 of 49 (22.4%) remis￾sion patients experienced renal flare at the end of 12
months [172]. Similar findings have been obtained in the
research conducted on 3 patients with class IV LN who
were treated with allogeneic MSCs. Two patients had
early, durable, and substantial complete remissions,
while the third patient achieved a partial remission,
which permitted reduction of medication doses by 50–
90%. Proteinuria levels were improved dramatically dur￾ing the first month after treatment, and the ameliora￾tions were sustained throughout the 9-month follow-up
period [173]. In contrast, a recently published multicen￾ter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clin￾ical trial in 18 patients with World Health Organization
class III or IV LN failed to show any beneficial effect of
hUC-MSCs [174].
Given the immune-regulatory properties, MSCs have
been administered to kidney transplant recipients, with
the aim of controlling the host immune response to￾wards the graft and minimizing immunosuppression,
possibly leading to transplant tolerance. A previous
study conducted by Perico et al. have reported that 2 re￾cipients of kidney transplant from a living-related donor
treated with autologous bone marrow-derived MSC au￾tologous (BM-MSCs) have had transient renal insuffi￾ciency (engraftment syndrome) 7–10 days after single
infusion [175]. Kidney biopsy revealed infiltration of im￾mune cells with C3 deposits. It is hypothesized that kid￾ney transplantation triggered graft inflammation, causing
recruitment of MSCs to the graft and favoring differenti￾ation of MSCs towards a proinflammatory phenotype
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 9 of 20

[176]. Perico et al. have amended the clinical protocol to
plan MSC infusion the day before transplantation, and
two subsequent patients who received MSCs before
transplantation did not experience any engraftment syn￾drome. Infusion of MSCs has promoted the develop￾ment of a pro-tolerogenic milieu, which is characterized
by an increase in the ratio between Tregs and memory
CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood as well as a pro￾found reduction in ex vivo anti-donor CD8+ T cell cyto￾lytic function. All MSC-treated patients had stable graft
function during a 5–7-year follow-up, without increasing
the susceptibility to infections or malignancy [177, 178].
Erpicum et al. reported that MSC-treated recipients
showed increased frequencies of regulatory T cells on
day 30, with no significant change in the B cell frequen￾cies when compared to that of concurrent controls
[179]. Clinical researches conducted by Mudrabettu
et al. or Reinders et al. were in line with the results of
the above research [180, 181]. Notably, administration of
MSCs has the potential to reduce the usage of immuno￾suppressants. Mounting evidence indicates that donor￾derived MSCs when combined with low-dose tacrolimus
have similar efficacy to that of standard immunosuppres￾sion following living-related renal transplantation, allow￾ing 50% reduction of maintenance immunosuppression
by calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) [182]. A large random￾ized clinical trial showed that among patients undergo￾ing renal transplantation, the use of autologous MSCs
when compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induc￾tion therapy resulted in lowering the incidence of acute
rejection, decreasing the risk of opportunistic infection,
and better estimated renal function at 1 year follow-up
[183] (Table 1).
Renal stem/progenitor cells
It is widely accepted that embryonic renal SCs with
nephrogenic potential would deplete soon after (mice)
or several weeks before (humans) birth. Interestingly, at
least 6000 cells derived from different nephron segments
are lost every hour in the urine, suggesting that the pro￾genitor cells are required for continuous replacement of
loss of cells during physiological processes [184]. Add￾itional evidence from several studies indicated that adult
kidney upon acute or chronic injury has some ability to
survive injury and undergo structural remodeling or re￾pair, supporting that it has certain potential to retain re￾generation. These have greatly encouraged researchers
to search for resident renal stem/progenitor cells
(RSPCs).
To our knowledge, there is no single bona fide marker
specific for RSPCs at present. Various attempts have
been made to identify and characterize RSPCs from dif￾ferentiated cells in adult kidney, including label-retaining
assays, flow cytometry using cell surface markers, and
side population assays.
In general, SCs have a slow turnover rate and display
minimal physiologic differentiation. When labeled nu￾cleic acids were incorporated, BrdU or 3H-thymidine,
SCs retain the label for longer periods of time, while
other cells lose [185]. Label-retaining cells (LRCs) are
believed to represent the SC compartment. Maeshima
and colleagues have first demonstrated the existence of
LRCs in renal tubuli of normal rat kidneys. Oliver et al.
have identified LRCs in the mouse papilla. These cells
form spheres in vitro as well as potentially differentiate
towards other lineages [186]. LRCs formed tubule-like
structure in 3D culture system and, when LRCs were
injected into cultured metanephros, formed nephrons
and collecting ducts [187]. The drawback of this tech￾nique is that the labels such as BrdU might be released
from the dying cells and were taken up from the adja￾cent dividing cells [188].
By using SC marker expression analyses, the RSPCs
were identified in the proximal tubules, in the medullary
papilla region, and in the Bowman capsule of human
kidneys, which are commonly characterized by the ex￾pression of CD133+ and embryonic renal marker PAX2
[30, 189, 190]. Further researches have suggested that
CD133+ renal stem cells always co-express CD24 in
adult human kidney tissue [191]. The CD24+
CD133+
cells had self-renewability and pluripotent differentiation
potential, forming a subset of parietal epithelial cells
(PECs) in Bowman’s capsule by expressing SC-specific
transcription factors Oct-4 and BmI-1 [28]. Numerous
studies have demonstrated that CD24+
CD133+ cells
from adult human kidney represent a multipotent adult
resident stem cell population [31, 191–193]. It also has
been reported that CD24+
CD133+
cells could be isolated
from human urine, which exhibit the same phenotypic
and functional features of RSPCs obtained from human
kidney tissue and show the potential to differentiate into
tubular cells as well as podocytes [194]. Moreover, the
RSPCs were further characterized molecularly by ex￾pressing the embryonic transcription factor OCT4 and
renal developmental genes PAX2, SIX2, and SALL1, and
low expression of fully differentiated kidney cell markers
[195, 196].
Other selection strategies based on functional assays
were utilized to identify and select RSPCs from human
renal tissue. With the ability to effectively efflux the
Hoechst dye, RSPCs can be detected via flow cytometry
and are termed as the side population (SP) cells, which
were found in murine kidney interstitial space in several
groups [197–200]. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) ac￾tivity was used to isolate cells with progenitor character￾istics from adult human renal cortical tissue. The
ALDHhigh cells expressed CD24 and CD133 and

displayed typical SC properties such as sphere formation
and anchorage-independent growth [29]. Although these
cells were identified using a different strategy and were
localized in different nephron segments, these all exhib￾ited the capacity to self-renew and the ability to differen￾tiate towards renal tubules or podocytes and different
lineages.
Experiments in rat and mouse models of tubular or
glomerular damage suggested a therapeutic effect of
adult RSPCs of different types and sites of origin. The
mechanism of RSPCs involved in kidney repair is associ￾ated to integrate into nephrons and is in parallel to a
paracrine mechanism based on renoprotective
molecules. The activated RSPCs would differentiate
along a particular cell lineage and replace the damaged
kidney cells. During acute kidney injury, the LRCs in the
papilla migrated to the upper papilla and formed a com￾partment of rapidly proliferating cells, which may play a
role in repair after ischemic injury [201]. The eventual
descendants of LRCs differentiated into epithelial cells
[202]. CD133+ cells are capable of differentiating into
epithelial or endothelial cells in in vitro and in vivo [30,
203], and the renal homing and integration of in vitro
expanded renal-derived CD133+ cells into some prox￾imal and distal tubules of SCID mice with glycerol￾induced acute tubulonecrosis were observed [30, 31,

CD24+
PDX− cells when injected into mice
with adriamycin-induced nephropathy glomerular, which
are engrafted into the glomerular structures and tubular
structures, accounted for 11.08 ± 3.3% of total podocytes
and 7.5 ± 1.9% of all proximal tubular cells in mice. The
results of intravenous injection of CD133+
CD24+
PDX−
cells reduced proteinuria and improved chronic glom￾erular damage of SCID mice suffering from nephrotic
syndrome [193]. Shen et al. directed the differentiation
of hiPSCs into endothelial progenitor cells (iEPCs). As
expected, intravenously infused iEPCs were recruited to
the injured kidney, replaced injured endothelial cells,
and relieve kidney damage in AKI mice. Interestingly,
iEPC therapy also ameliorated apoptosis of cardiomyo￾cytes and cardiac dysfunction and no GFP-iEPCs in
mouse hearts were observed. It was speculated that the
protective effect of iEPC therapy on the heart may have
resulted from the reduction of uremic toxin IS and pro￾inflammatory IL-1β in circulation [205]. In addition, the
injection of kidney SP cells into the AKI model demon￾strated the recovery of renal function [198, 199]. How￾ever, some studies did not observe significant renal
integration of SP cells and differentiation into renal cells
was not observed as expected in some studies [199, 206].
A variety of cytokine/growth factors including IL-15,
endothelial growth factor (EGF), and TNF-α that are se￾creted by RSPCs were detected, supporting a paracrine
mechanism, similar to that described for MSCs might
also contribute to systemic tissue repair [207, 208]. Bus￾solati et al. demonstrated that renal CD133+
/CD73+ pro￾genitors induce erythropoietin under hypoxia and inhibit
prolyl pydroxylase [209]. Aggarwal et al. further provided
evidence that the production and release of erythropoi￾etin in in vivo stimulated by CD133+ renal progenitor
cells contributed to the protection against fibrosis, limit￾ing the presence of pro-inflammatory in SCID mice with
AKI [189]. Recently, it has been reported that RSPCs
protect physically injured or chemically damaged renal
proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) by secreting
regenerative molecules and microvesicles containing
inhibin-A (Inhb-A) and decorin (DCN) [210]. Hishikawa
and colleagues have reported that the SP cells isolated
from the kidney with acute renal failure expressed high
levels of renoprotective factors, such as HGF, VEGF, and
leukemia inhibitory factor [198]. Also, the exosomes
from conditioned medium of urine-derived stem cells
(USCs-Exo) might have the potential to prevent kidney
injury from diabetes by inhibiting podocyte apoptosis
and promoting vascular regeneration and cell survival
[194]. Since these cells could be conveniently obtained
through non-invasive methods, urine-derived RSPCs
possessed great potential in cell therapy and tissue re￾generation. Furthermore, the release of pro-active renal
protective factors from distal sites might also be
involved, and this is because the intravenously injected
RSPCs were localized in extrarenal organs such as the
lungs and liver.
Despite the important role played in the repair and re￾generation of damaged kidney tissue, a study showed
that the dysregulated proliferation of renal progenitor
cells generates hyperplastic glomerular lesions, scarring,
and nephron loss eventually leading to degenerative dis￾ease such as crescentic nephritis or collapsing glomeru￾lopathy [211].
Many researchers believe the presence of renal stem/
progenitor cells, but a debate in this field is still going
on and some different theories have been put forward.
Kusaba et al. have showed that fully differentiated epi￾thelial cells accomplish proximal tubule repair through
reversible dedifferentiation and proliferation, without
any contribution from the preexisting intratubular SC or
progenitor population. In their study, injury to proximal
epithelial tubule induced expression of markers of puta￾tive epithelial SCs in human kidney (CD24, CD133, and
vimentin). What is more, no dilution of fate marker was
observed when mice with completely labeled kidneys
were subjected to injury and repair, indicating that un￾labeled progenitors do not contribute to kidney repair
[212]. Berger and colleagues have also suggested that
there is no fixed progenitor cell population in the kid￾ney, and tubular cells transiently acquire the phenotype
of progenitor cells with reparative characteristics follow￾ing injury [213].
Challenges in the clinical translation of stem cells
Stem cells have shown great potential in kidney injury
repair and disease treatment, but some pressing issues
remain to be resolved before the clinical application.
ESCs have limited clinical application due to ethical is￾sues regarding their origin, tumorigenicity after trans￾plantation. As the donor cells most likely do not
originate from the recipient patient, immunological re￾jection of the cells differentiated from ESCs upon allo￾geneic cell transplantation remains a major challenge for
cell therapy. Simultaneous administration of immuno￾suppressive drugs can aid in overcoming these problems
but can induce serious side effects [214]. It has been
proposed to overcome the immunogenicity of ESC￾derived grafts by establishment of ESC donor banks cov￾ering various HLAs from selected homozygous HLA￾typed volunteers. However, it is a labor-intensive, time￾consuming work that is hard to carry out [215]. When it
comes to iPSCs, the highly proliferative nature and the
use of viral vectors for reprogramming exist with the risk
of tumor development following transplantation, al￾though some safer approaches such as the use of small
molecules either have less reprogramming efficiency or
usually cannot induce pluripotency alone.
Liu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2020) 11:249 Page 13 of 20

Reprogramming factors used to induce pluripotency (in
particular, the proto-oncogenes c-MYC and KLF4) may
become re-activated in the transplanted cells differenti￾ated from iPSCs [216]. Moreover, frustrations due to
low replication rate and premature aging were encoun￾tered in the administration of iPSCs.
Despite considerable body of evidence in in vitro sup￾ports the usefulness of MSCs, controversies about the
use of SCs still persist. In clinical trials, the improvement
of renal function and structure induced by MSCs in clin￾ical trials is not as obvious as expected. The main rea￾sons for the limited clinical efficacy were the low
engraftment, the poor survival rate, and the impaired
paracrine capacity of injected cells in vivo. The majority
of grafted MSCs might be trapped in the lungs, liver,
and spleen. For those cells engrafted into the target tis￾sues, the harsh microenvironment still would induce
apoptosis in over 90% of transplanted MSCs in 1 week.
To improve the beneficial effects of MSC transplant￾ation, the efficient strategy of administration of MSC
needs to be discussed. A recent meta-analysis of MSC
administration in kidney disease revealed that cell ad￾ministration > 1 day after injury yielded greater thera￾peutic value than within 24 h of injury [217]. Liu et al.
proposed that the timing of MSC administration should
be immediately after ischemia to 1 h post-I/R. As the
lack of inflammation in the early injured kidney was fa￾vorable for MSC survival within the tissue, favorable ex￾pression of homing adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and
VCAM-1 were present, further promoting MSCs to inte￾grate into injured kidney tissue [218]. In the mouse
model of graft-versus-host disease, MSCs were most ef￾fective when administered at 3, 8, or 20 days after bone
marrow transplantation [219]. In contrast, Casiraghi
et al. proposed that injection of MSCs before transplant￾ation rather than after it could achieve better immune
suppression [176]. Therefore, the optimal timing of
MSC administration for different kidney diseases re￾mains under discussion. With more warnings, a long￾term examination of intrarenal injection of MSCs in pro￾gressive rat model of glomerulonephritis has reported an
abnormal and detrimental adipogenic differentiation of
MSCs, suggesting the potential harm of administration
of MSCs [218]. With regard to RSPCs, which showed
the priority in displaying the inherent patient specificity
at genomic level and kidney-specific epigenetic changes,
the tissues from which autologous RSPCs can be ob￾tained are poorly accessible or insufficient for cell
isolation.
The immune rejection of stem cell injection is another
challenge that hinders the clinical application of stem
cell-based therapy. The allogeneic cells derived from
hESCs will be robustly immune rejected by the recipient
due to the direct activation of T cells by the foreign
MHCs. While the patient-specific iPSCs share the same
genetic background, and their derivatives might have a
better chance to be immune tolerated, the genomic in￾stability and abnormal epigenetics associated with iPSCs
can induce immunogenicity in some cells of their deriva￾tives [220]. MSCs have long been reported to be
hypoimmunogenic or “immune privileged.” However, re￾cent studies suggest it is not appropriate to consider
MSCs to be immune privileged because they could elicit
a humoral and cellular immune response in vivo. For ex￾ample, whereas culture-expanded MSCs express low
levels of MHC class me and are negative for MHC class
II, this will likely be activated and/or expressed when
MSCs are exposed to IFN-γ or differentiated into mature
cell types [221]. Combining MSCs and anti-rejection
drugs or a use modified MSC that reduces immunogen￾icity may be the possible strategies to overcome rejection
of all MSCs [222].
Conclusion
Whatever the sources or the approaches utilized such as
ESCs, iPSCs, MSCs, or RSPCs, it is widely acceptable
that there is an enormous hope underlying the usage of
SC therapy as a clinically viable alternative for kidney
diseases. Recent advances in cell-based therapy using
various cell sources have demonstrated great promise to￾wards restoring normal kidney functions in the AKI,
DN, and CKD models, etc. The kidney organoids in￾duced by stem cells provide the authentic and practical
models for investigating kidney development and disease
and progressing understanding about tissue regener￾ation, drug screening, and disease modeling. Although
the stem cells from different sources show great promise
as therapeutic agents for kidney diseases, the amount of
research currently available is insufficient to achieve the
docking of different kidney diseases with the most suit￾able transplanted stem cells. But interestingly, because of
their immunomodulatory properties, MSCs may be the
most promising candidates for stem cell therapy of
autoimmune-related kidney diseases. In addition, MSCs
obtained from autologous sources in sufficient amounts
allow early treatment of patients affected by AKI. There
is a need to carry out appropriately designed experimen￾tal studies to verify long-term safety of these therapies
and to examine the risks of fibrosis, maldifferentiation
or malignancy, and AEs of systemic immune suppres￾sion. Only the results of larger, well-powered rigorously
designed clinical trials will assist in determining the real
clinical efficacy of SC therapy in kidney diseases. Add￾itionally, there are more factors that should be taken
into consideration in the clinical application of SC ther￾apy, such as appropriate selection of cell types, number
of cells required, and appropriate route of administra￾tion. These combined efforts favor the translation of
