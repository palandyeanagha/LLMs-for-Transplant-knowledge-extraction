Treatment of Klebsiella Pneumoniae
Carbapenemase (KPC) infections: a review of
published case series and case reports
Grace C Lee1,2* and David S Burgess3
Abstract
The emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) producing bacteria has become a significant
global public health challenge while the optimal treatment remains undefined. We performed a systematic review
of published studies and reports of treatment outcomes of KPC infections using MEDLINE (2001–2011). Articles or
cases were excluded if one of the following was fulfilled: no individual patient data provided, no treatment regimen
specified, no treatment outcome specified, report of colonization, or greater than three antibiotics were used to
treat the KPC infection. Data extracted included patient demographics, site of infection, organism, KPC subtype,
antimicrobial therapy directed at KPC-infection, and treatment outcome. Statistical analysis was performed in an
exploratory manner. A total of 38 articles comprising 105 cases were included in the analysis. The majority of
infections were due to K. pneumoniae (89%). The most common site of infection was blood (52%), followed by
respiratory (30%), and urine (10%). Forty-nine (47%) cases received monotherapy and 56 (53%) cases received
combination therapy directed at the KPC-infection. Significantly more treatment failures were seen in cases that
received monotherapy compared to cases who received combination therapy (49% vs 25%; p= 0.01). Respiratory
infections were associated with higher rates of treatment failure with monotherapy compared to combination
therapy (67% vs 29% p= 0.03). Polymyxin monotherapy was associated with higher treatment failure rates
compared to polymyxin-based combination therapy (73% vs 29%; p= 0.02); similarly, higher treatment failure rates
were seen with carbapenem monotherapy compared to carbapenem-based combination therapy (60% vs 26%;
p= 0.03). Overall treatment failure rates were not significantly different in the three most common antibiotic-class
combinations: polymyxin plus carbapenem, polymyxin plus tigecycline, polymyxin plus aminoglycoside (30%, 29%,
and 25% respectively; p=0.6). In conclusion, combination therapy is recommended for the treatment of KPC
infections; however, which combination of antimicrobial agents needs to be established in future prospective
clinical trials.

Introduction
The increasing incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae car￾bapenemases (KPCs) is a significant public health chal￾lenge [1]. Previously confined to sporadic outbreaks in
the northeastern United States, KPCs have now spread
throughout the world and have reached endemic propor￾tions in countries such as Israel and Greece [2,3]. Fur￾thermore, KPC-producing organisms can confer
resistance to multiple different antimicrobial classes, in￾cluding all available β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and
aminoglycosides [4,5]. As such, infections due to KPCs
are associated with high therapeutic failure and mortality
rates of at least 50% [6,7]. The limited number of agents
available for the treatment of KPCs presents a tremen￾dous challenge to clinicians. Given the lean pipeline of
new antimicrobials, further investigations into optimal

treatment modalities are urgently needed. However,
studies on the treatment of KPC infections are scarce
and mainly limited to case series and case reports.
Therefore, we sought to perform a systematic review of
individual cases in an effort to summarize therapeutic
outcomes of various treatment regimens for KPC
infections.
Case selection
A systematic review of English language articles using
MEDLINE (2001–2011) was conducted. Additional stud￾ies were identified by searching bibliographies of primary
articles and annual conference abstracts from 2008–
2011. Search terms included kpc.mp, Drug Therapy/mt,
mo, Treatment Outcome, Case Reports, and Disease
Outbreaks/pc. All searches were limited to humans.
Articles were eligible if they included patients with infec￾tions due to KPC-producing bacteria. Articles were
excluded from further review if they fulfilled at least one
of the following criteria: no individual patient data
reported, no treatment regimen specified, no treatment
outcome specified, or greater than three antibiotics or
multiple antibiotic regimens directed at the KPC infec￾tion. Clinical success and failures were recorded as
reported by the authors of each report. Analysis of the
proportion of clinical failures was calculated as the num￾ber of failures divided by the number of treated patients.
Several characteristics from the cases were extracted in￾cluding the patient’s age, sex, medical history, site(s) of
infection, type of infection, organism, KPC subtype,
APACHE II score, admission to the intensive care unit
(ICU), length of stay before infection, total length of
stay, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
selected antimicrobials (carbapenem, polymyxin, and
tigecycline), antimicrobial therapy before isolation, anti￾microbial therapy directed at KPC-infection, and treat￾ment outcome. Antimicrobial agents were categorized
into the following classes: polymyxins, carbapenems, gly￾cylcycline, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, beta-lactam
plus beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, tri￾methoprim-sulfamethoxazole, monobactams, fosfomy￾cin, and tetracyclines. Combination therapy was defined
as at least two but no more than three, antibiotics with
gram-negative activity reported to be directed at KPC
infections. Statistical analysis was performed in an ex￾ploratory manner. Comparisons were made using χ2 or
Fisher's exact test for categorical variables using JMP 8.0
W (SAS Corp, Cary, NC).
Study characteristics
A total of 54 relevant articles were identified searching
MEDLINE, 12 from bibliographies of retrieved articles,
and 61 from conference abstracts (Figure 1). Of these
127 citations, 62 articles were eligible for review for
study inclusion. A total of 24 articles were excluded for
the following reasons: no patient specific treatment and/
or outcomes (n=18), greater than three antimicrobials
(n=4), and reports of colonization (n=2). Within the 38
articles included, 34 individual cases were excluded for
the following reasons: no patient specific treatment and/
or outcomes (n=15), greater than three antimicrobials
(n=9), and reports of colonization (n=10). A total of 38
reports comprising 105 cases met the inclusion criteria,
and consisted of case series (47%), retrospective cohort
studies (35%), and case reports (17%). The majority of
reports were from the US (42%), followed by Greece
(10%). As expected, the number of studies reported per
year increased. The majority of the articles (58%) for this
review were published in 2009 and 2011.
Several limitations should be noted. Individual studies/
reports did not always define treatment failure or treat￾ment success. Antimicrobial dosing, procedures, residual
colonization, antimicrobial timing were not always reported
and therefore not considered in the outcome analysis.
Characteristics of cases
Characteristics of cases evaluated in this review are pre￾sented in Table 1. The mean age was 62 years ± 19, 55%
were males, and 72% were admitted to the ICU. The
mean APACHE II Score was 20.6 ± 8, the mean length
of stay before infection was 17.5 days ± 19, while the
mean total length of stay was 54.8 days ± 40. Infection
characteristics are described in Table 2. Most of the
reported infections were due to KPC-2 (86%). Organisms
largely comprised of K. pneumoniae (89%), followed dis￾tantly by Pseudomonas spp (4%), E. coli (3%), S. marces￾cens (3%), and E. cloacae (2%). The most common site
of infection was blood (52%), followed by lung (30%),
and urine (10%).
Treatment of KPC infections
Cases received regimens containing the following anti￾microbials or antimicrobial classes: 45 cases received a
polymyxin, 39 cases received a carbapenem, 30 cases
received an aminoglycoside, 26 cases received a glycylcy￾cline, 7 cases received a fluoroquinolone, 5 cases
received a beta-lactam plus beta-lactamase inhibitor, 2
cases received cephalosporins, 2 cases received a tetra￾cycline, 2 cases received a monobactam, 1 case received
fosfomycin, and 1 case received trimethoprim-sulfa￾methoxazole. Overall, 49 (47%) cases received mono￾therapy and 56 (53%) cases received combination
therapy directed at KPC-infections.
Summary of treatment outcomes
A summary of the treatment outcomes is provided in
Table 3. The overall rate of treatment failure was 36%
(38/105). Pulmonary infections were associated with the

highest rate of treatment failure (47%) followed by blood
infections (39%). Of the cases with KPC infections due
to Klebsiella species, 62% (57/92) reported treatment
success, 50% (1/2) for Enterobacter cloacae, 100% (3/3)
for Serratia marcescens, and 100% (3/3) for E. coli. Inter￾estingly, all 4 cases of Pseudomonal KPC infections
reported treatment failure. Infections with blakpc-3 had a
higher rate of treatment failure than blakpc-2 (36% vs.
50%; p = 0.35). Pathogens harboring blakpc-3 consisted of
K. pneumoniae (12; 86%) and Raoultella spp (2; 14%).
Polymyxins

therapy (73% vs 29%; p= 0.02) [8-24]. Of the 11 cases
who received polymyxin monotherapy, 73% (8/11)
experienced treatment failure [8,10,18,20,23,25]. Of the
nine patients treated for bloodstream infections (BSIs),
six patients were treatment failures. Both patients trea￾ted for pneumonia with colistin monotherapy failed
treatment [18]. Among cases who received polymyxin￾based combination therapy, 71% (24/34) patients had
successful treatment outcomes. Of these 24 patients, the
most common treatment regimen was tigecycline plus
colistin (50%), followed by carbapenem plus polymyxin
(33%) and aminoglycosides plus polymyxin (13%).
Twenty-nine percent of patients (10/34) who received
polymyxin-based combination therapy experienced treat￾ment failure. Five patients were treated for BSIs with the
following regimens: carbapenem plus colistin (3), tigecy￾cline plus colistin (1), and amikacin plus colistin (1)
[8,9,12]. In the latter case, the patient developed colistin
resistance (MIC 0.25 μg/mL to 16 μg/mL) while on
treatment and eventually died. The other five cases of
treatment failure consisted of cases of pulmonary infec￾tion treated with the following antimicrobials in combin￾ation with a polymyxin: tigecycline (3), carbapenem (1),
and fluoroquinolone (1) [8,11,16,26].
Although polymyxins were the most commonly used
antimicrobial against KPC infections in this review, the
effectiveness of polymyxins for the treatment of KPC
infections is not well established. Various in-vitro studies
have demonstrated bactericidal activity and synergy
when polymyxins are tested in combination with carba￾penems, rifampin or tigecycline, while monotherapy
often led to significant re-growth by 24 hours [27-29].
Furthermore, a report by Lee and colleagues [30] evalu￾ated 12 patients with persistent blood cultures positive
for KPC-K. pneumoniae despite 3 days of treatment with
either polymyxin B alone or polymyxin B plus tigecy￾cline. Interestingly, 3 of the 12 patients who received
polymyxin B monotherapy had significant increases in
MIC values (1.5 μg/mL to 32 μg/mL, 0.75 μg/mL to 12
μg/mL, and 0.75 μg/mL to 1024 μg/mL) while none of
the patients who received polymyxin B in combination
with tigecycline developed resistance. The authors
hypothesized that combination therapy may have pre￾vented resistance in patients who received both poly￾myxin B and tigecycline. Similar reports of gram
negative organisms developing resistance to colistin have
been described [31-33]. Polymyxins are one of the few
antimicrobial classes that remain susceptible to KPC￾producing organisms. Increasing reports of polymyxin
resistance described in case reports and recent outbreaks
of polymyxin-resistant strains are troubling [33-39].
Combination therapy may be an important strategy for
the management of KPC infections when utilizing poly￾myxins. However, determining which antimicrobial in
combination with polymyxins is superior still needs to
be established in further clinical studies.
Carbapenems
Of the 39 cases who received a carbapenem, 51% (20/39)
received carbapenem monotherapy and 49% (19/39)
received carbapenem-based combination therapy [8,14,
16,17,40-50]. Carbapenem monotherapy had higher rates
of treatment failure compared to carbapenem-based com￾bination therapy (60% versus 26% p=0.03). Of the 20 ca￾ses who received carbapenem monotherapy, 55% (11/20)
failed treatment, including 6 cases with strains having
MICs ≤4 μg/mL (previous CLSI breakpoint for imi￾penem and meropenem). The majority of those who
failed treatment had pneumonia or tracheobronchitis (7),
followed by BSI (3), and urinary tract infection (UTI) (1)
[40,43,48,49]. Among cases who received carbapenem￾Table 2 Infection characteristics

based combination therapy, 74% of patients (14/19) had
successful treatment outcomes. In these 14 patients, the
most common treatment regimen was polymyxin plus
carbapenem (8), followed by aminoglycoside plus carbape￾nem (4), and beta-lactam plus beta-lactamase inhibitor
plus carbapenem (2). A total of 5 patients receiving
carbapenem-based combination therapy experienced
treatment failure. All but one of these 5 patients were
treated with a carbapenem plus polymyxin.
Several issues regarding the use of carbapenems for the
treatment of KPC-infections should be considered. Nine
of the cases who received carbapenem monotherapy were
reported from one retrospective case series [40]. In the
retrospective review, patients infected with imipenem
non-susceptible KPC K. pneumoniae (MIC > 4 μg/mL)
treated with alternative therapies had a higher rate of suc￾cessful treatment (8/10, 80%) when compared with
patients infected with imipenem-susceptible (MIC ≤ 4
μg/mL) KPC K. pneumoniae treated with a carbapenem
(4/9, 44.4%). The optimal pharmacodynamic parameter
for carbapenems is the time the free carbapenem concen￾tration remains above the MIC (%T > MIC) [51]; however,
whether this parameter is valid in the presence of KPCs is
controversial. In a mouse thigh infection model, Craig
et al. [52] demonstrated that the presence of KPCs had no
impact on achieving pharmacodynamic parameters of
strains with MICs up to 16 μg/mL. There has been only
one case report describing the successful use of high-dose
continuous infusion meropenem monotherapy for a car￾bapenem non-susceptible KPC K. pneumoniae (MIC= 8
μg/mL) BSI [50]. In contrast, an in vitro model, simulating
human exposure to a high-dose prolonged-infusion mero￾penem (2 g every 8 h over 3-hr infusion), demonstrated
that the killing activity at 24 hours, against KPC￾producing K. pneumoniae strains, were inferior to
non-carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa
strains despite similar meropenem MICs [53]. The authors
attributed this to the rapid in-vitro hydrolysis of merope￾nem, resulting in lower exposure of meropenem to the
KPC K. pneumoniae. The Clinical and Laboratory Stan￾dards Institute (CLSI) recently lowered clinical break￾points of carbapenems to exclude KPC-producing
organisms in the previous susceptible range [54]. Suscepti￾bilities to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have
been defined by an MIC up to 1 μg/mL and 0.5 μg/mL for
ertapenem. The utility of carbapenem monotherapy
against strains containing KPCs remains controversial.
Until further data are available, the use of combination or
alternative therapy may be warranted.
Tigecycline
Of the 26 cases who received tigecycline, 7 cases re￾ceived tigecycline monotherapy and 19 received tigecycline￾based combination therapy [8,9,11,12,17,26,40,41,47,55,56].
There was no significant difference in treatment failure
rates between cases receiving tigecycline monotherapy
compared to those receiving combination therapy (29% vs.
37%;p = 0.4). Twenty-nine percent (2/7) of patients who
received tigecycline monotherapy experienced treatment
failure. One patient was treated for urosepsis and the
other was treated for nosocomial pneumonia and empy￾ema [40,56]. In the latter, even though a long course of
tigecycline resolved the pneumonia, treatment was com￾plicated by recurrence of empyema associated with an in￾crease in tigecycline MIC from 0.75 to 2 μg/mL. Of the 19
patients who received tigecycline combination therapy, 14
(74%) received polymyxin plus tigecycline, 3 (16%)
received tigecycline plus aminoglycoside, and 2 (11%)
received tigecycline plus carbapenem. Both patients who
received tigecycline plus a carbapenem experienced treat￾ment failures [40,41]. In one report, despite a month-long
course of tigecycline and meropenem for KPC-K. pneu￾moniae bacteremia secondary to sclerosing cholangitis,
the patient experienced relapse of the bacteremia which
was associated with the development of resistance to both
meropenem and tigecycline [41].
Tigecycline has demonstrated excellent spectrum of
activity against KPC-producing organisms. In a collection
of 106 carbapenemase-producing strains from various
countries, tigecycline was the only antimicrobial with
100% activity [5]. However, there are no breakpoints set by
the CLSI for tigecycline for Enterobacteriaceae (FDA￾approved breakpoint for tigecycline is < 2 μg/mL). In
addition, tigecycline has limited activity against Pseudo￾monas species. Clinical issues with tigecycline’s pharmaco￾kinetic properties may raise some caution in treatment of
UTIs and BSIs due to low urinary (< 22%) and low plasma
(≤ 0.9 mg/L) concentrations [57,58]. However, tigecycline
has been used successfully in treating these infections;
both patients included in this review who were treated
with tigecycline monotherapy for their UTIs, were treated
successfully [40,59]. In contrast, in an evaluation of 48
patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
bacteremia in a tertiary care hospital, all 8 patients with
break-through bacteremias had received tigecycline [60]
reports of tigecycline resistance have been previously
demonstrated in Enterobacteriaceae [56,61-63]. Finally,
tigecycline is a bacteriostatic agent; thus, alternative agents
or combination therapy may be required for infections
requiring bactericidal activity.
Aminoglycosides
A total of 30 cases received an aminoglycoside, 20% (6/30)
of cases as monotherapy and 80% (24/30) as combination
therapy [8-13,16,19,22,40,42,47,48,55,64-68]. There was no
significant difference in treatment failure rates between
those who received aminoglycoside monotherapy com￾pared to combination therapy (0% vs. 17%; p= 0.6).
Lee and Burgess Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials 2012, 11:32 Page 5 of 9
http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/11/1/32

Interestingly, all six cases who received aminoglycoside
monotherapy reported success: three cases were treated
for BSIs, two cases were treated for UTIs, and one case
was treated for a respiratory infection [11,13,40,64]. A
recent study demonstrated that aminoglycosides, when
active in vitro, were associated with a significantly higher
rate of microbiologic clearance of carbapenem-resistant K.
pneumoniae in the urine compared to polymyxin B or
tigecycline [69]. Of the patients who received
aminoglycoside-based combination therapy, the most
common treatment was amikacin plus colistin (11), fol￾lowed by aminoglycoside plus a carbapenem (4), amino￾glycoside plus a fluoroquinolone (5), aminoglycoside plus
tigecycline (2), gentamicin plus aztreonam (1), and amika￾cin plus tetracycline (1). Despite in-vitro evidence of an￾tagonism when using polymyxins and aminoglycosides in
combination, 6 clinical cases of polymyxin plus an amino￾glycoside reported treatment success [11,19,22,65]. All
patients who failed therapy with aminoglycoside-based
therapy had BSIs. One reported case had bacteremia due
to KPC-2-producing E. cloacae and P. putida recovered
simultaneously from multiple cultures; the patient eventu￾ally died [68]. Herein, the most commonly employed ami￾noglycoside combination was amikacin plus colistin; but,
the potential increased risk of nephrotoxicity with this
combination is a major concern.
Combination versus monotherapy
Of all cases meeting the study inclusion criteria, 49
(47%) cases received monotherapy and 56 (53%) cases
received combination therapy directed at KPC-infec￾tions. Significantly more treatment failures were seen in
cases treated with monotherapy than those treated with
combination therapy (49% vs. 25%; p= 0.01) (Table 4).
Similar treatment failure rates were observed in the
three most common antibiotic-class combinations: poly￾myxin plus a carbapenem, polymyxin plus tigecycline,
polymyxin plus an aminoglycoside (30%, 29%, and 25%
respectively; p=0.6). In three cases, triple antimicrobial
therapy directed at the KPC infection was used: one case
received doripenem plus polymyxin B plus rifampin and
2 cases received tigecycline plus colistin plus garamycin
[11,17]. All three cases were treated successfully.
A review of treatment outcomes versus sites of infec￾tion showed urinary sources of infection had the highest
overall treatment success rates of 81% (9/11). A recent
retrospective cohort study of 21 patients with UTIs
described similar positive clinical responses in 16 (76%)
patients [70]. Of the 11 patients who were treated for
UTIs in this review, the majority were treated with
monotherapy (8/11), and of these patients, only one
experienced treatment failure while on imipenem
(MIC=4 μg/mL) [40]. The eight cases treated success￾fully with monotherapy received either a carbapenem
(3), tigecycline (2), an aminoglycoside (1), ciprofloxacin
(1) or cefepime (1) [8,16]. All 3 cases treated with com￾bination therapy for UTIs reported treatment success.
The pulmonary site of infection was associated with
higher rates of treatment failure with monotherapy com￾pared to combination therapy (67% vs. 29% p= 0.03).
Among the 17 patients with pulmonary infections trea￾ted successfully, more than 75% of cases received com￾bination therapy. The most common regimen for the
successful treatment of pulmonary infections consisted
of tigecycline plus colistin (8), followed by an aminogly￾coside plus colistin (3). Likewise, there was a lower fail￾ure rate treating blood-stream infections with
combination therapy compared to monotherapy, (28%
vs. 50%; p=0.09).
Several recent studies have supported the role of com￾bination therapy for treating KPC infections. In a cohort
of 41 patients with KPC- K. pneumoniae bacteremia, the
use of combination therapy was associated with
improved 28-day mortality [71]. The most common suc￾cessful combination employed in this cohort was a poly￾myxin in combination with either tigecycline or a
carbapenem. Tumbarello et al. [72] conducted a study in
three Italian hospitals and demonstrated that combin￾ation therapy, particularly a triple-drug regimen includ￾ing tigecycline, colistin, plus a carbapenem, was
independently associated with improved survival. Like￾wise, in a previous pool of 55 individual cases, combin￾ation therapy was associated with successful outcomes
compared to monotherapy, particularly if polymyxins
were part of the regimen [73].
Conclusion
Infections caused by KPC-producing bacteria have been
associated with high mortality rates and frequent treat￾ment failure. Clinical data on treatment are limited and
appropriate therapy for KPC infections is not well
defined. This review demonstrated that monotherapy is

associated with higher treatment failure rates compared
to combination therapy when managing infections due
to KPC-producing bacteria, particularly when treating
respiratory infections. Polymyxins and carbapenems
when used alone were associated with higher treatment
failure than when used in combination. Until further
data are available, combination therapy is recommended.
However, which antimicrobial combination is superior
has yet to be established.
