Abstract
Background: To facilitate in the identification of gene products important in regulating renal
glomerular structure and function, we have produced an annotated transcriptome database for
normal human glomeruli using the SAGE approach.
Description: The database contains 22,907 unique SAGE tag sequences, with a total tag count of
48,905. For each SAGE tag, the ratio of its frequency in glomeruli relative to that in 115 non￾glomerular tissues or cells, a measure of transcript enrichment in glomeruli, was calculated. A total
of 133 SAGE tags representing well-characterized transcripts were enriched 10-fold or more in
glomeruli compared to other tissues. Comparison of data from this study with a previous human
glomerular Sau3A-anchored SAGE library reveals that 47 of the highly enriched transcripts are
common to both libraries. Among these are the SAGE tags representing many podocyte￾predominant transcripts like WT-1, podocin and synaptopodin. Enrichment of podocyte transcript
tags SAGE library indicates that other SAGE tags observed at much higher frequencies in this
glomerular compared to non-glomerular SAGE libraries are likely to be glomerulus-predominant.
A higher level of mRNA expression for 19 transcripts represented by glomerulus-enriched SAGE
tags was verified by RT-PCR comparing glomeruli to lung, liver and spleen.
Conclusion: The database can be retrieved from, or interrogated online at http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/
SAGE. The annotated database is also provided as an additional file with gene identification for
9,022, and matches to the human genome or transcript homologs in other species for 1,433 tags.
It should be a useful tool for in silico mining of glomerular gene expression.
Background
Renal glomeruli are highly specialized capillary tufts that
produce a nearly protein-free ultrafiltrate of plasma at a
rate of about 30 plasma volumes daily. Several hereditary,
immune-mediated and metabolic disorders cause glomer￾ular injury, proteinuria, and can lead to renal failure. The
three intrinsic glomerular cell types, podocytes, mesangial
cells, and glomerular endothelial cells (EC) are highly spe￾cialized. Podocytes extend an elaborate array of actin-rich
foot processes around the exterior of the glomerular cap￾illary loops, forming a scaffold with nephrin-based filtra￾tion slit diaphragms spanning the space between adjacent
foot processes [1]. Mesangial cells are pericyte-like cells
that, unlike most other pericytes, form an interstitium
within the intracapillary space [2]. Glomerular EC are
packed with transcellular fenestrae ringed by actin [3,4].

The fenestrae serve the high glomerular capillary wall
hydraulic conductivity [5], while a glycocalyx covering the
glomerular EC and podocytes together with the podocyte
filtration slit diaphragm impede the movement of plasma
proteins [6-8] across the glomerular capillary wall.
Transcriptome and proteomic approaches are helping to
define genes highly expressed and/or enriched in glomer￾uli [9-12]. For instance, Sau3A-anchored SAGE databases
have been built with RNA extracted from microdissected
nephron segments, and enrichment of several glomerular
transcripts relative to other nephron segments has been
reported [9]. Furthermore, many proteins uniquely
expressed by, or enriched in podocytes have been identi￾fied over the past decade and their specific functions are
increasingly well defined [13]. Finally, by analysis of ESTs
enriched in glomeruli, ehd3 was shown to be the first
transcript expressed exclusively by glomerular EC [12].
The current study sought to extend previous transcrip￾tome-based work by building a human glomerular Long￾SAGE database that can be interrogated directly online.
SAGE is based on the principal that a small (here 17 bp)
tag sequence immediately 3' of an "anchoring" restriction
site is a unique identifier of each transcript [14]. The fre￾quency of specific SAGE tags relative to the total pool of
tags reflects their abundance in the source mRNA. In silico
comparison of SAGE libraries from diverse tissues can
then be used to discover differential expression of tran￾scripts [15]. The level of expression of any specific tran￾script can also be probed in silico by interrogating SAGE
libraries with the transcript's unique SAGE tag sequence.
We report here the gene expression profile of transcripts
for human glomeruli and compare them to pooled SAGE
libraries for non-glomerular tissues and cells. Many of the
most highly enriched glomerular transcripts reported here
were previously found in a Sau3A-anchored glomerular
library [9]. Nonetheless, the current SAGE database con￾tains additional glomerulus-enriched transcript tags, and
since it is NlaIII-anchored it now allows direct compari￾son with many non-renal SAGE libraries. The data should
serve as a useful resource for investigators studying
glomerular gene expression.
Construction and content
Cells and Tissues
Human kidney tissue was obtained from the uninvolved
portion of tumor nephrectomy specimens (Human Sub￾jects Protocols: #6196 University of Alberta and #155/97
University of Frankfurt). Patient 1 was a 45 year old Cau￾casian female, patient 2 a 72 yo Caucasian male. Renal tis￾sue was collected only from patients in whom the serum
creatinine was within normal limits, and in whom diabe￾tes mellitus, hypertension, and proteinuria were absent.
Specific parameters were not collected for individual
patients. The relative purity of isolated glomeruli and the
normal histological appearance of kidney cortex used in
this study are shown in Figure 1. That the cDNA template
used for SAGE contained mRNA representing glomerular
capillary endothelium is shown by RT-PCR amplification
of PECAM-1 (836 bp) and the non-integrin laminin
receptor LAMR1 (256 bp). Greater synaptopodin tran￾script abundance in glomerular, compared to whole kid￾ney cortex mRNA from the same specimen also shows
appropriate enrichment of the source mRNA in glomeru￾lar podocyte transcripts (Figure 1). Amplification of the
long PECAM-1 sequence furthermore shows that the
source mRNA was intact. Sufficient mRNA for construc￾tion of the SAGE library was only obtained from patient
2. The integrity of this source material was also verified by
Agilent 2100 microfluidics analysis (data not shown).
Human Glomerular SAGE Library Construction
For SAGE, human glomeruli were isolated by sieving in ice￾cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from the kidney of a
72-year old male using minor modifications of the proto￾col for rat glomeruli [16,17]. Glomeruli were immediately
placed into RNA-Protect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed
by isolation of 4.7 μg total RNA with the RNeasy kit (Qia￾gen). A SAGE library was then custom-constructed by Gen￾zyme Corporation (Framingham, MA) using the "long"
SAGE protocol, producing 17 bp SAGE tags with the CATG
(NlaIII) anchoring restriction site [18]. A total of 2304
clones containing concatenated ditags were sequenced,
resulting in 48,926 tags. Of these, 1,361 were derived from
duplicate ditags. Tags from duplicate ditags were not
removed [19]. Twenty-one tags were removed as they con￾tained ambiguous (N) nucleotides leaving 48,905 tags and
22,907 unique long SAGE tags for analysis.
Tag sequences and their absolute counts in 115 distinct
"long" SAGE libraries were retrieved from
cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE (98,944,923 tags). All "long"
SAGE Libraries available before July 1, 2008 were
included without selection. Tissues and cells represented
include normal brain, breast, skin, pancreas, bladder, gall￾bladder, uterus, vein, testis, white blood cells, lung macro￾phages, embryonic stem cells as well as malignant tumors
including colon and lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma,
among others. The frequency of each tag (count/total tag
number) was calculated for each of the 115 libraries and
expressed as tags per million (TPM). The mean TPM for
the non-glomerular libraries (Pool TPM) is reported. The
frequency ratio of the glomerular: Pool TPM was then cal￾culated to establish degree of enrichment of specific tags
in glomeruli (Ratio G: P). Statistical comparison of the
pooled libraries with the current glomerular SAGE library
was based on Chi-square analysis using absolute tag
counts [20]. Comparison to a human kidney SAGE library
(SAGE_Kidney_normal_B_1, from cgap.nci.nih.gov/
SAGE) was based on the short (10 bp) tag sequences.

For each SAGE tag, identification was based on the
"Hs_long.best_gene.gz" database found at ftp://
ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/SAGE/HUMAN/. The SAGE Genie
algorithm for identifying the best gene match for SAGE
tags was reported by Boon et al. [21]. For some tags, the
Blast n algorithm at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi, was used to match tag sequences that could not
be assigned by the "Hs_long.best_gene.gz" database. For
these, the SAGE tag had to be in the +/+ orientation with
the corresponding mRNA or EST, and fully match the 17
bp sequence immediately 3' of the NlaIII site nearest the
Poly(A)+ tail or a stretch of > 8 A's as previously reported
[22]. Positive identification based on this latter search
strategy is indicated in additional file 1 by asterisks.
RT-PCR Analysis
For quantitative RT-PCR, glomeruli were microdissected
from distinct pre-transplant kidney biopsy specimens
obtained from three separate donors aged 57, 59 and 63
at the University of Göteborg (Human Subjects Protocol
#653-05). Immediately after biopsy, one half of one
biopsy core was placed into 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS con￾taining 100 U RNAse inhibitor (RNAsin) (Applied Biosys￾tems, Foster City, CA, USA). Four to fifteen glomeruli were
isolated using a stereomicroscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany)
followed by extraction of total RNA. cDNA was generated
from glomerular RNA with SuperScript™ III RT (Invitro￾gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Human kidney, spleen, lung and
liver mRNA was purchased from Invitrogen/Ambion
(Carlsbad, CA). Reactions without RT for each primer set
served as controls. PCR cycling was performed with 100
ng template (94°C – 3 min; 35 cycles: 94°C – 30 sec;
55°C – 30 sec; 68°C – 30 sec plus 1 min for each kilobase
pair (kbp) of PCR product to be amplified; 72°C – 7 min).
Quantification of gene expression was performed accord￾ing to the delta Ct method (DeltaCt2/DeltaCt1), as
described by others [23], and by this laboratory [22].
Human Glomerular SAGE Database Content
The complete human glomerular SAGE library was depos￾ited in the Gene Expression Omnibus http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ repository (record GSE8114,
Accession # GSM199994) and in the SAGE Genie collec￾tion http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE as "LSAGE_Kidney_
Glomeruli_Normal_B_bjballer1". It consists of 22,907,
unique 17 bp tag sequences and the absolute tag count for
each sequence. The total tag count in the library is 48,905.
The library is also appended in spreadsheet format with tag
identification (additional file 1).
Utility
Retrieval of Highly Enriched Glomerular Transcripts
The transcripts most highly enriched in human glomeruli
identified by this study are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and
Additional files 3 and 4. Of the 22,907 tags, 291 were
observed with an absolute count of 4 (81 TPM) or greater
and enriched more than 10-fold relative to pooled non-kid￾ney SAGE libraries. For 84 of these no reliable match to a
known cDNA sequence was found, and a match to incom￾pletely defined ESTs was observed for 8 others. The tags rep￾resenting Aldolase B, uromodulin, glutamyl
aminopeptidase, glutathione peroxidase, and SLC25A45
were excluded from this set because they were not enriched
relative to whole kidney. They likely represent transcripts
expressed at very high levels in contaminating tubules. Sev￾eral highly expressed transcripts produced more than one
unique tag, which is common and usually reflects priming
from internal poly A(+) runs or alternatively spliced tran￾scripts. After removal of such redundant tags, 133 well￾characterized tags highly enriched in glomeruli were estab￾lished (Tables 1 and 2 and Additional files 3 &4).
A previously published Sau3A-anchored SAGE library [9]
prepared from microdissected human glomeruli con￾tained 184 SAGE tags that were enriched in glomeruli rel￾Human Kidney Source Material Figure 1

ative to other micro-dissected nephron segments. These
represented 156 well-characterized transcripts. As
expected, the corresponding NlaIII SAGE tag for 143 of
these was also observed in the current glomerular SAGE
library (Tables 1 and 2 and Additional files 3 and 4 and
additional file 2). For 47 transcripts represented in both
libraries a 10-fold or greater enrichment of the NlaIII tag
relative to non-glomerular cells and tissues was observed
and is shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Additional files 3 and
4. The NlaIII tag corresponding to the remaining 96 tran￾scripts identified in the Sau3A library was enriched rela￾tive to whole kidney, in keeping with the previous report
[9], but less than 10 fold relative to non-renal tissues
(additional file 2).
Many of the highly expressed and highly enriched tran￾scripts observed in this library are encoded by genes
already known to be unique or highly enriched in glomer￾ular podocytes, for instance Podocin (NPHS2), Nephrin
(NPHS1), transcription factor 21 (Pod1, FLJ35700), Pro￾tein Tyrosine Phosphatase Glepp 1 (PTPRO), Synaptopo￾din (SYNPO), indicating that this SAGE database
appropriately represents glomerular transcripts and that it
identifies transcripts enriched in glomeruli. Some of the
SAGE tags enriched in glomeruli represent known
endothelial cell-predominant genes, for instance Endo￾mucin (EMCN), claudin 5 (CLDN5), NOSTRIN and
CD34, consistent with abundant EC in glomeruli.
To independently demonstrate the utility of this database
in defining enrichment of transcripts in glomeruli, RT￾PCR comparing the level of expression of 19 transcripts
enriched in the glomerular SAGE library with that in lung,
spleen and liver was performed. Lung, liver and spleen
were not represented in the pooled SAGE libraries used
here. For each, glomeruli microdissected from the kidneys
of three distinct donors were used. The source mRNA used
for RT-PCR was distinct from that used for generation of
the SAGE library. Transcripts were chosen to represent a
spectrum of glomerular enrichment, and some well￾known podocyte-predominant transcripts (TCF21,
VEGFA) were included as internal controls. Overall, the
degree of glomerular transcript enrichment observed by
RT-PCR compared to lung, liver and spleen was similar to
that observed by SAGE, though there was variation
between lung, spleen and liver (Table 3). The wide range
of expression observed in the three non-glomerular tis￾sues was expected, as the pooled SAGE-based comparison
does not take into account tissue-to-tissue variation in
gene expression.
Finally, it is of note that 117 transcript tags observed 2 or
more times and enriched > 500 fold in this glomerular
library remain unidentified or poorly characterized (addi￾tional file 1). At least some of these will likely prove to be
currently unknown glomerulus-predominant transcripts.
In Silico Interrogation of the Glomerular SAGE Database
The current database can be retrieved directly or interro￾gated in silico. It may be used to determine whether any
specific gene is highly expressed in glomeruli, and to
define transcripts that are highly enriched relative to other
tissues for which SAGE libraries are available.
To assess whether a specific transcript is expressed in
glomeruli, the SAGE tags uniquely identifying the tran￾script can be found at http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/
using the "SAGE Anatomic Viewer" [21]. The "Digital
Northern" tool is then used to evaluate the level of expres￾sion in the SAGE libraries of the collection, which
includes the current library. The collection can also be
interrogated using specific NlaIII SAGE tags of cDNA
sequences for which a gene symbol may not yet have been
assigned. The tag can be retrieved from any cDNA
sequence by identifying the 17-nt sequence immediately
3' of the last NlaIII site (CATG) prior to the poly(A+) tail.
Its frequency in the glomerular database is an indicator of
the level of expression in human glomeruli. The 95% con￾fidence interval for observing any tag with a true count of
4 is ± 3.96. Hence, any transcript producing a tag fre￾quency of 4 per 48,905 (81.8 TPM) or greater has a 95%
probability of being represented in this library. Failure to
find the SAGE tag representing any specific transcript in
this library indicates that its expression level is lower than
the limit of detection, or that the transcript does not con￾tain an NlaIII restriction site from which a SAGE tag could
be generated.
The "LSAGE_Kidney_Glomeruli_Normal_B_bjballer1"
database can also be compared directly to a single, or sets
of other SAGE databases in the SAGE Genie collection
using the "SAGE Digital Gene Expression Displayer
(DGED)" tool at http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/. This type
of analysis will return data similar to those in additional
file 1, though comparison can also be restricted to specific
libraries rather than the pool of libraries evaluated here.
Finally, this SAGE library with matching transcript identi￾fication, glomerulus to pool ratio and glomerulus to kid￾ney ratio is supplied as additional file 1, where the order
is based on tag abundance. This data set contains only
18,152 SAGE tags, as any tag found only once and not in
any other library was removed. The table can be retrieved
without restriction and, if desired, sorted based on the
degree of tag enrichment.
Discussion
This study established a human glomerular SAGE library
that can be used for data mining by investigators with an
interest in glomerular cell biology and pathophysiology.
The library was appropriately enriched in SAGE tags rep￾resenting transcripts known to be restricted to glomerular
podocytes, including nephrin [24], podocin [25], synap-

topodin [26], podocalyxin [27], transcription factor 21
[28], the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O
GLEPP1 [29], the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor C1
[30] and nestin [31]. It is therefore likely that other tran￾scripts whose SAGE tags are much more highly repre￾sented in this library compared to SAGE libraries from
other tissues and cells are also expressed predominantly in
glomeruli.
A SAGE library that used Sau3A as the anchoring restric￾tion enzyme was previously produced from human
glomerular mRNA [9]. It identified 155 highly expressed
transcripts in glomeruli that were enriched in glomeruli
when compared to microdissected non-glomerular neph￾ron segments. Since the previously published glomerular
SAGE library is based on the Sau3A anchoring restriction
site, it does not allow in silico comparison of tag frequen￾cies with the much greater collection of NlaIII-based
SAGE libraries. All except 12 transcripts reported to be
enriched in glomeruli by Chabardes-Garonne [9] were
observed in the current glomerular SAGE library. The cor￾responding NlaIII tag for a subset of these (47 tags) was
enriched > 10 fold when compared to non-renal tissues
and cells (Tables 1 and 2 and Additional files 3 &4), pro￾viding independent evidence that these represent glomer￾ulus-predominant transcripts.
The current study also identified 86 transcript tags that
were enriched more than 10 fold in glomeruli, but which
were not represented in the previous Sau3A anchored

P) is shown. The transcript abundance relative to lung (G: Lu), spleen (G: Sp) and liver (G: Li) was determined by RT-PCR using distinct sets of 
microdissected glomeruli from kidneys of three different donors. G: glomeruli, Lu: lung, Sp: spleen, Li: liver. Mean ± SEM.

library (Tables 1 and 2 and Additional files 3 &4). Failure
to find a Sau3A SAGE tag for known glomerulus-restricted
genes like nephrin, or an NlaIII SAGE tag for endoglin and
VCAM1, suggests either that the tag frequency was too low
to be detected or that the required restriction site was
absent from the transcript. The current study also shows
that that several transcripts more highly expressed in
glomeruli compared to other nephron segments [9] are
not restricted to glomeruli when compared to non-renal
tissues or cells (additional file 2). This is not surprising
since some transcripts that are not shared between neph￾ron epithelium and glomerular capillary tuft nevertheless
may be highly expressed in other tissues.
Several transcripts not previously shown to have a specific
function in glomeruli were highly expressed and enriched
in glomeruli when compared to non-glomerular tissues.
Among these, the tag for the chloride intracellular channel
5 (CLIC5) is very abundant in the glomerular transcript
pool, and its frequency in glomeruli was more than 800
fold greater than in other tissues. The transcript
"DKFZp564B076" whose SAGE tag was previously shown
to be enriched in microdissected glomeruli [9] and later in
cultured glomerular EC in this laboratory [22] is identical
to the 3' end of CLIC5. CLIC5 is an ezrin-binding protein
involved in maintaining actin-based microvilli in the pla￾centa and actin-based stereocilia in the inner ear [32]. Its
role in glomerular cell function is as yet undefined. The
transcript for the basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) is
also very abundant in glomeruli and enriched approxi￾mately 58 fold. BCAM is a glycoprotein that functions as
a receptor for alpha5 laminin. BCAM immunoreactivity is
observed in both, glomerular podocytes and glomerular
EC, and mice deficient in BCAM have significant struc￾tural abnormalities of glomeruli [33]. Glomerular expres￾sion of the parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1) was
not expected. PTHR1 is very abundant in renal proximal
tubule cells and could therefore represent proximal tubule
contamination. However, since the PTHR1 SAGE tag was
less abundant in renal cortex than in glomeruli (Table 1
and Additional file 3), its enrichment in this library can￾not be due to proximal tubule contamination. Indeed,
mesangial cells express PTHR1 [34]. More work is
required to define the function of PTHR1 in mesangial
cells. In this regard, it is of great interest that Sclerostin, an
inhibitor of bone matrix formation whose expression is
regulated by PTH, is also expressed at much higher levels
in glomeruli than in most non-renal tissues and cells
(Table 1 and Additional file 3) or in other nephron seg￾ments [9]. While we have no comparison with a bone
SAGE library where sclerostin is likely expressed at high
levels, the finding nonetheless suggests that it could be
involved in regulating extracellular matrix depositon in
glomeruli. Nephronectin, a ligand for integrin
alpha8beta1 is known to be essential for renal develop￾ment, and is expressed in renal epithelium. Enrichment of
the nephronectin SAGE tag in the glomerular library rela￾tive to kidney cortex is in keeping with the observation by
Brandenberger et al [35], who observed very strong neph￾ronectin immunoreactivity in differentiating glomeruli.
The secreted glycoprotein testican 2 SPARC (SPOCK2)
belongs to in the osteonectin/SPARC family [36] is also
highly expressed and enriched in glomeruli. Members of
this family of proteins regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions, and SPOCK2 is induced after glomerular
injury [37]. The other protein in this family is connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF). The SAGE tag for CTGF was
observed at a high frequency in glomeruli (additional file
1) but it was not highly enriched relative to other tissues.
Nonetheless, both SPOCK2 and CTGF likely play a critical
role in regulating glomerular remodeling. In 2006 Lakhe￾Reddy and coworkers [38] described the localization of
beta 8 integrin to glomerular mesangial cells and observed
that its expression may suppress mesangial cell dedifferen￾tiation via Rac1 activation. The SAGE tag for integrin beta
8 was highly expressed and enriched in this glomerular
library.
While several semaphorins are expressed in renal glomer￾uli, so far a role for semaphorin 3G, whose SAGE tag is
abundant and enriched in this database, has not been
described. Still, semphorin 3G, which has repulsive func￾tion via neuropilin 2 binding in the CSN neuronal guid￾ance, is also highly expressed in kidney [39], begging the
question whether it serves an important function is in
glomeruli. Based on this study many other transcripts are
highly enriched in glomeruli. It is hoped that other inves￾tigators will use this database as a tool to further define
the transcriptome of glomerular cells in health and dis￾ease.
We did not observe the NlaIII SAGE tag for EHD3, a tran￾script previously shown to be unique for glomerular
endothelial cells [12], in this library. A SAGE tag for EHD3
also is not observed in the previously published Sau3A￾anchored library [9]. Failure to observe this tag does not
detract from the previous observations but only suggests
that the EHD3 transcript abundance was too low to gen￾erate a SAGE tag in the two glomerular SAGE libraries.
Finally, not all tags observed in this SAGE library have as
yet been matched to a specific gene. For some of these uni￾dentified SAGE tags, matching sequences within the
human genome are observed, but whether they represent
specific transcripts is currently not known.
Conclusion
We have constructed a new human glomerular SAGE
library, based on the NlaIII anchoring restriction site. The
database can be searched to determine whether specific

transcripts are highly expressed and/or enriched in
glomeruli and it can be used a resource to further study
transcripts that appear to be glomerulus-enriched but
whose function in glomeruli has not been investigated so
far.

Authors' contributions
WF, JN and BJB developed the conceptual design of the
study. Contributions by WF and JN were equivalent. WF
isolated human glomeruli and prepared RNA from
glomeruli for construction of the SAGE library, and per￾formed work shown in Figure 1. AG microdissected
human glomeruli for RT-PCR analysis. JN performed RT￾PCR on microdissected human glomeruli. SK performed
immunofluorescence analysis. BJB performed the bioin￾formatics work and wrote the manuscript. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.

Additional file 1
Annotated NlaIII-anchored human glomerular long SAGE library. 
Additional file 1 contains all (18,152) NlaIII-anchored long SAGE tags 
observed in the current glomerular library and at least twice in this + cur￾rently reported long SAGE libraries. The SAGE tags are sorted by fre￾quency (a measure of expression of the corresponding transcript). Genes 
matched to each tag, chromosomal localization, absolute SAGE tag count 
in the glomerular library, frequency (TPM) in the glomerular and the 
pooled libraries and the ratio of glomerular: pooled frequencies are shown. 
Absolute counts and TPM for the corresponding short NlaIII-based SAGE 
tag in whole kidney and the ratio of SAGE tag TPM in glomeruli: kidney 
are shown. The dataset can be downloaded without restriction.

SAGE tags observed NlaIII and Sau3A glomerular libraries but 
enriched less than 10 fold. This dataset represents all Sau3A tags 
reported by Chabardes-Garonne (9) to be enriched in glomeruli when 
compared to microdissected nephron segments that were also observed in 
the current NlaIII anchored library, but for which the corresponding 
NlaIII tags were enriched less than 10 fold when compared to pooled non￾renal tissues and cells.
