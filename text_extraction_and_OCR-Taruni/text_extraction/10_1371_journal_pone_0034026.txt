Abstract
Background: Uremic toxins are considered to have a determinant pathological role in the progression of chronic kidney
disease. The aim of this study was to define the putative pathological roles of the renal renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
system (RAAS) and renal tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in kidney fibrosis induced by (indoxyl sulfate) IS
and (p-cresol sulfate) PCS.
Methods: Mouse proximal renal tubular cells (PKSV-PRs) treated with IS or PCS were used. Half-nephrectomized B-6 mice
were treated with IS or PCS for 4 weeks. In the losartan treatment study, the study animal was administrated with
IS+losartan or PCS+losartan for 4 weeks.
Results: IS and PCS significantly activated the intrarenal RAAS by increasing renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin 1 (AT1)
receptor expression, and decreasing AT2 receptor expression in vitro and in vivo. IS and PCS significantly increased
transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1) expression and activated the TGF-b pathway by increasing Smad2/Smad2-P,
Smad3/Smad3-P, and Smad4 expression. The expression of the EMT-associated transcription factor Snail was increased by IS
and PCS treatment. IS and PCS induced the phenotype of EMT-like transition in renal tubules by increasing the expression of
fibronectin and a-smooth muscle actin and decreasing the expression of E-cadherin. Losartan significantly attenuated the
expression of TGF-b1 and Snail, and decreased kidney fibrosis induced by IS and PCS in vivo.
Conclusion: Activating the renal RAAS/TGF-b pathway has an important pathological role in chronic kidney injury caused by
IS and PCS. IS and PCS may increase Snail expression and induce EMT-like transition.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disease. The renal
toxicity of uremic toxins is thought to have a determinant
pathological role in the progression of chronic kidney disease.
Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) are important
examples of the protein-bound uremic toxins that are not
dialyzable. They have similar features, such as the albumin￾binding site, and both originate from protein fermentation [1,2].
These molecules have been linked to oxidative injury [3,4]. IS and
PCS have been clinically associated with the risk of cardiovascular
disease [5,6]. Our previous clinical study had showed that serum
levels of IS and PCS are significantly associated with the
progression of chronic kidney disease [7]. Accumulated evidence
has revealed that IS and PCS play significant pathological roles in
chronic kidney injury in vitro and in vivo [8–10].
Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)
is one of the main mechanisms of chronic ischemic nephropathy￾associated progression of chronic kidney disease. Inhibition of the
RAAS is currently one of the most powerful therapies for slowing
the progression of chronic kidney disease [11,12]. RAAS
activation could further activate transforming growth factor-b
(TGF-b), which is known as an important fibrogenic cytokine in
the development of kidney fibrosis [13,14]. IS stimulates renal
synthesis of TGF-b1 and the progression of renal failure in vivo
[15].
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered an
important mechanism in the development and progression of
malignancies [16,17]. EMT induced by TGF-b1 has been
reported as a possible mechanism for kidney fibrosis [18,19]. In
addition, RAAS activation is able to induce EMT by both TGF￾dependent and TGF-independent actions, both in vitro and in vivo
[20]
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that IS and PCS could
induce kidney fibrosis by activating the intrarenal RAAS and
inducing renal tubular EMT. In addition, the putative patholog￾ical role of EMT in kidney fibrosis induced by IS and PCS was
studied.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal experiments were approved by the local committee
for experimental animals at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
(permit number: 2010121406).
Mouse proximal renal tubular cell culture
Mouse proximal renal tubular cells (PKSV-PRs), provided by
Dr. Alain Vandewalle, were cultured in a modified culture
medium as described previously [21,22]. Serum starvation was
conducted for 24 h to synchronize the cells prior to IS (Sigma￾Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and PCS (Kureha Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) treatment. During the IS and PCS treatment
course, serum-free medium was used. The duration of the
treatment was 72 h. The concentrations of IS and PCS used in
the in vitro experiments are described in the figures and figure
legends. The control PKSV cells were treated with the same
volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cultured under
the same conditions. In the losartan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) treatment study, PKSV cells after 24 h serum
starvation were treated with losartan and IS/PCS for 72 h. The
dosage for IS, PCS and losartan were illustrated in figures.
Each treatment was repeated in triplet for the following
analysis.
Animal study
Ten-week-old male B-6 mice with K-nephrectomy were used in
this study. The study animals were divided into control,
experiment, and treatment groups. The control mice (n = 8)
received daily PBS injections at the same volume as the
experimental mice for 4 weeks. The experimental mice received
intraperitoneal injection with IS (n = 8) or PCS (n = 8) at a dose of
100 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. There were 2 subgroups of treatment
mice. The IS+losartan group received intraperitoneal injection
with IS (100 mg/kg/day) and oral losartan treatment (25 mg/kg/
day) via a feeding tube for 4 weeks (n = 8). The PCS+losartan
group received intraperitoneal injection with PCS (100 mg/kg/
day) and oral losartan treatment (25 mg/kg/day) via a feeding
tube for 4 weeks (n = 8). The renal cortex was microdissected for
further analysis at the end of the animal study.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Whole kidney or cell extracts (10 mg) were used to isolate total
RNA using a commercial kit (RNeasy Kit; Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including
DNase treatment. Five micrograms of total RNA was then reverse
transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA,
USA) with random primers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed in 25 mL SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 0.6 mol/L

sulfate (IS) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) at concentrations of 5 and 50 mg/L had significantly increased AT1 receptor protein expression. IS and PCS at
concentrations of 1, 5, and 50 mg/L significantly decreased AT2 receptor protein expression in vitro. C: The angiotensin II concentrations in the
culture medium were measured by EIA method. The angiotensin II concentration of control PKSV cells was lower than detection limit. Treatment with
IS (5 and 50 mg/L) and PCS (1, 5 and 50 mg/L) significantly increased angiotensin II production. (*: P,0.05; **: P,0.01; ***: P,0.001, vs. control).

primers and 1 mg cDNA by using an iQ5 real-time PCR detection
system (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA). The thermal cycling
program and PCR primers are listed in Table S1. Each PCR
reaction was performed in triplicate, and the mean Ct value was
used for statistical analysis. Messenger RNA expression was
standardized to b-actin expression levels, followed by normaliza￾tion to the control group.
Western blotting analysis
Kidney tissues and PKSV cells were homogenized, and total
protein was extracted using a commercial kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Protein Extraction Kit; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Kidney and cell extracts (30 mg protein per
lane) were mixed with a sample loading buffer and separated on
12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were
electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes
(0.2 mm; Immun-Blot; Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA). The
antibodies used for western blotting are listed in Table S2. The
intensity of each band was quantified using the NIH Image
software, and the densitometric intensity corresponding to each
band was normalized against b-actin expression.
Assays for angiotensin II and transforming growth factor￾b1
The angiotensin II and TGF-b1 concentrations in the culture
medium were analyzed by EIA (Angiotensin II EIA Kit;
RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) and ELISA (TGF-beta 1
Quantikine ELISA Kit; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN,
USA) methods respectively. The analysis was performed according
to the product instruction, and read by SpectraMax M3
(Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Each test was
repeated in triplet, and the average value was used for the
following statistical analysis.
Immunofluorescence staining
Cryostat sections of renal tissue and PKSV cells fixed with ice￾cold acetone were incubated overnight at 4uC with primary
antibodies against mouse; this was followed by incubation with
appropriate secondary immunofluorescent antibodies for 1 h at
room temperature. The antibodies for immunofluorescence
staining and the folds of dilution are described in Supplement 2.
The cell nucleus was stained with Hoechst stains (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA).
Histopathological examination
Sections of paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with the
Masson trichrome to assess the degree of renal fibrosis. Four
random and non-overlapping sections from each kidney tissue
were examined under high power field (4006). The nephroscle￾rosis scores including interstitial and glomerular fibrosis were
analyzed. Glomerular and interstitial fibrosis was assessed, and the
severity of nephrosclerosis was semiquantified with a 0 to 3+ scale

that chronic IS and PCS injection could significantly increase
renal TGF-b1 and Snail expression in vivo (Figure 4).
IS and PCS induced EMT-like transition
The results of real-time PCR showed that PKSV cells treated
with IS or PCS at concentrations of 1, 5, and 50 mg/L
significantly increased fibronectin and decreased E-cadherin
mRNA expression. The a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression
was significantly increased in PKSV cells treated with IS or PCS at
concentrations of 5 and 50 mg/L (Figure 5A). The results of
immunostaining for fibronectin, E-cadherin, and a-SMA in vitro
are shown in Figure 5B. Positive staining for fibronectin and a￾SMA were significantly increased in PKSV cells treated with IS or
PCS at a concentration of 5 mg/L. Staining for E-cadherin was
significantly decreased in PKSV cells treated with IS or PCS than
in the control group.
The animal study results show that chronic treatment with IS or
PCS could significantly increase renal fibronectin and a-SMA
mRNA expression. IS and PCS significantly decreased renal E￾cadherin mRNA expression in vivo (Figure 6A). The results of
immunostaining in study animals also revealed that chronic IS or
PCS treatment significantly increased the interstitial expression of
fibronectin and a-SMA and decreased E-cadherin expression
(Figure 6B).

protein expression in mice injected with IS or PCS (Figure 8B).
Comparing the mice treated with IS or PCS only, losartan
treatment significantly decreased kidney fibrosis induced by IS and
PCS (Figure 8C). The nephrosclerosis scores for the study animals
are plotted in Figure 8C. Compared with the control mice, the
mice treated with IS and PCS had significantly higher nephro￾sclerosis scores (IS vs. control: 4.1960.76 vs. 0.8960.36, P,0.05;

with losartan had significantly lower nephrosclerosis scores than
those treated with IS or PCS only (IS+losartan vs. IS: 2.6660.53

Discussion
The main findings of this study suggest that IS and PCS might
activate the intrarenal RAAS and TGF/Smad pathway. EMT-like
transition of tubular cells activated by the EMT-associated
transcription factor Snail might be a possible mechanism for
kidney fibrosis induced by IS and PCS.
The main pathophysiological mechanisms associated with
chronic kidney disease result from the activation of the RAAS.
Oxidative stress leads to activation of the RAAS, with a
subsequent increase in the levels of angiotensin II and TGF-b1,
which are 2 important molecular mediators of kidney injury [23].
Previous studies using IS have demonstrated that IS increases
renal oxidative stress, induces abnormal oxygen consumption in
renal tubules, and aggravates chronic hypoxia of the kidney [24].
Our results show that both IS and PCS could activate renal
RAAS, increasing renin, angiotensinogen, and AT1 receptor
expression and decreasing AT2 receptor expression in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, our data demonstrate that blocking RAAS with
losartan could significantly decrease the severity of nephrosclerosis
induced by IS and PCS.
Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that TGF-b plays an
important role in the progression of renal disease. Smad2/3
activation is critical for the pro-fibrotic effect of TGF-b [25].
Smad4 binds to Smad2/3 and facilitates the translocation of the
heteromeric complex into the nucleus [26]. Previous studies have
revealed that IS stimulates TGF-b1 synthesis in proximal tubular
cells and the progression of renal failure. IS also increases renal
TIMP-1 and pro-alpha 1(I) collagen expression in uremic rats
[15,27]. Activation of the RAAS is a key mediator in the
progression of renal disease [23]. Many profibrotic effects of
RAAS activation are mediated by stimulation of TGF-b.
Components of RAAS activation including renin, angiotensin
II/III and aldosterone all upregulate TGF-b expression [28].
There is accumulating evidence that angiotensin II is able to
induce EMT by both TGF-b-dependent and TGF-b-independent
actions, both in vitro and in vivo [29,30]. Previous study has showed
that blocking TGF-b-dependent pathway could significantly
decrease chronic kidney fibrosis by inhibiting EMT [18,31]. Our
study has revealed that both IS and PCS could increase renal
TGF-b1 expression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our in vitro study
has shown that IS and PCS activate the TGF-b pathway by
activating the Smad2/3 pathway and increasing Smad4 expres￾sion. Blocking the RAAS with losartan could significantly decrease
renal TGF-b1 expression in mice injected with IS or PCS. The
results of this study suggested that activations of TGF-b-dependent
signaling pathway by RAAS might have important roles in the
kidney injury by IS and PCS.
EMT is a process by which differentiated epithelial cells
undergo a phenotypic conversion that gives rise to matrix￾producing fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Tubular cell EMT is
considered to be a fundamental contributor to renal fibrosis [20].
TGF-b/Smad, integrin-linked kinase, and Wnt/b-catenin signal￾ing are essential intracellular signal transduction pathways for
controlling the process of EMT [32]. TGF-b1 is the most potent
factor for EMT, and many other prosclerotic factors have indirect
effects on EMT, via the induction of TGF-b1 [33,34]. RAAS
activation is able to induce EMT by both TGF-dependent and
TGF-independent actions [20]. Angiotensin II mediates EMT in
tubular cells by activating ANG 1–7/MAS-1-dependent pathways
[35]. Our results show that IS and PCS could induce EMT in
tubular cells in vitro and in vivo, and activation of the TGF-b/Smad
pathway by RAAS is a possible mechanism.
Our study also shows that IS and PCS could increase the
expression of the EMT-associated transcription factor Snail in
renal tubules. Snail has been reported to be a key effector in
cancer-related EMT, which is associated with malignant tumor
progression [36]. The interaction between the Snail and TGF-b
signaling pathway is mutual. It was reported that TGF-b1 hyper￾expression could increase Snail expression [37,38]. Previous
studies have showed that Snail was a key mediator in the TGF￾b1-mediated EMT. Blocking Snail function could mitigate the
TGF-b1-mediated EMT [39]. In breast cancer, Snail and Slug
could activate TGF-b signaling pathway [40]. Snail induction by
adriamycin is also known to cause mesenchymal conversion of

podocytes [41]. A previous study with obstructive nephropathy
(UUO) animal model revealed that blocking RAAS with
angiotensin II receptor, renin receptor blockers or both could
decrease the Snail-1 and TGF-b1 expression, and attenuated
UUO-related kidney fibrosis [42]. Our study also showed similar
results. It was suggested that an increase in Snail expression as a
result of TGF-b pathway activation has an important role in the
EMT process induced by IS and PCS in renal tubular cells.
The putative mechanisms for the kidney fibrosis induced by IS
and PCS was summarized in Figure 9. The activation of the renal
RAAS/TGF-b pathway has an important pathological role in
chronic kidney injury caused by IS and PCS. IS and PCS may
increase Snail expression which might further increase TGF-b
expression, and induce EMT-like transition in renal tubular cells.
Our study details the pathological mechanisms of chronic renal
injury caused by uremic toxins. However, it should be stressed that
this study has some limitations because only a mouse model and a
cultured mouse renal tubular cell line were used. Whether these
results can extend to primary culture renal tubular cells, and be
applied to human disease, remains to be determined.
