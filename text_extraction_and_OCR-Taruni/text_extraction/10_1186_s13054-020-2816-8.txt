Abstract
Background: Concomitant vasoactive drugs are often required to maintain adequate perfusion pressure in patients
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiogenic shock (CS) receiving hemodynamic support with an axial
flow pump (Impella CP).
Objective: To compare the effect of equipotent dosages of epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and
phenylephrine on cardiac work and end-organ perfusion in a porcine model of profound ischemic CS supported
with an Impella CP.
Methods: CS was induced in 10 pigs by stepwise intracoronary injection of polyvinyl microspheres. Hemodynamic
support with Impella CP was initiated followed by blinded crossover to vasoactive treatment with norepinephrine
(0.10 μg/kg/min), epinephrine (0.10 μg/kg/min), or dopamine (10 μg/kg/min) for 30 min each. At the end of the
study, phenylephrine (10 μg/kg/min) was administered for 20 min. The primary outcome was cardiac workload, a
product of pressure-volume area (PVA) and heart rate (HR), measured using the conductance catheter technique.
End-organ perfusion was assessed by measuring venous oxygen saturation from the pulmonary artery (SvO2),
jugular bulb, and renal vein. Treatment effects were evaluated using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression.
Results: All catecholamines significantly increased LV stroke work and cardiac work, dopamine to the greatest
extend by 341.8 × 103 (mmHg × mL)/min [95% CI (174.1, 509.5), p < 0.0001], and SvO2 significantly improved during
all catecholamines. Phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor, caused a significant increase in cardiac work by 437.8 × 103
(mmHg × mL)/min [95% CI (297.9, 577.6), p < 0.0001] due to increase in potential energy (p = 0.001), but no
significant change in LV stroke work. Also, phenylephrine tended to decrease SvO2 (p = 0.063) and increased arterial
lactate levels (p = 0.002).
Conclusion: Catecholamines increased end-organ perfusion at the expense of increased cardiac work, most by
dopamine. However, phenylephrine increased cardiac work with no increase in end-organ perfusion.

Introduction
Reversing the vicious cycle of critically low cardiac output
(CO) and perfusion pressure in acute myocardial infarc￾tion and cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains challenging,
leading to sustained mortality of approximately 50% for
the last few decades [1–5]. Hemodynamic support strat￾egies aim to restore central perfusion using vasoactive
drugs as first-line therapy [6], followed by the use of
mechanical circulatory support devices [7, 8]. Exogenous
catecholamines stimulating α- and/or β-adrenergic recep￾tors are administrated in about 90% of AMICS cases [1,
9]. However, observational studies suggest that high dos￾age and prolonged use of vasoactive drugs are associated
with increased mortality [10, 11]. β-Adrenergic agonists
improve inotropic and chronotropic state, thus improving
CO by enhancing myocardial contractility and increasing
heart rate (HR) [12]. Although the use of vasoactive drugs
to increase perfusion pressure and flow is theoretically
beneficial in AMICS, it comes at the expense of increased
left ventricular (LV) mechanical work with the potential
to accelerate myocardial ischemia and induce arrhythmias
[6]. Vasoconstriction without a concomitant increase in
CO may also aggravate organ hypoperfusion [13]. Mech￾anical circulatory support devices seem appealing and are
increasingly used in AMICS to overcome the potential ad￾verse effects and limitations of catecholamines [1, 14]. The
Impella CP is a transvalvular axial flow pump with the in￾let placed in the LV and the outlet in the ascending aorta
and is capable of pumping up to 3.5 L/min oxygenated
blood from the LV to the aorta. The forward flow in￾creases systemic and coronary perfusion while reducing
cardiac work [15]. Despite Impella support, additional
pharmacological support is often necessary to maintain
adequate perfusion pressure [10, 16], and the optimal
vasoactive drug choice is currently unknown.
Thus, this study aimed to compare cardiac work and
end-organ perfusion during infusion of equipotent dos￾ages of four commonly used vasoactive agents (epineph￾rine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine) in
pigs with experimentally induced CS supported by the
Impella CP device.
Methods
Animals
Ten female Danish Landrace pigs weighing approximately
70 kg were studied. The study was approved and conducted
per guidelines of the Danish Animal Experiments Expector￾ate (authorization number: 2016-15-00951). Unfractionated
heparin (20 IU) was administered every 2 h to avoid blood
clotting during the experiment. Amiodarone (300 mg) was
injected before instrumentation followed by continuous in￾fusion of 50 mg/h to avoid malignant arrhythmias. Instru￾mentation was done using the percutaneous Seldinger
technique, except for the surgical exposure of the internal
jugular vein. Instrumentation included placement of a con￾ductance catheter (Ventri-Cath 512 PV Loop Catheter,
Millar Inc.) in the LV for continuous recordings of
pressure-volume (PV) relationships, a conductance catheter
in the aorta to measure aortic pressure, a central line, and a
continuous CO 7.5-Fr Swan-Ganz catheter with SvO2 re￾cording (Edwards Lifesciences Corp. Irvine, CA, USA)
placed in the pulmonary artery. A conventional triple
lumen 7-Fr Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifesciences
Corp. Irvine, CA, USA) was placed in the renal vein via
femoral venous access, and a 4-Fr double-lumen central
venous catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, USA) in a
retrograde fashion in the internal jugular vein to obtain
organ-specific blood gasses for measuring oxygen satur￾ation and lactate levels.
Experimental protocol
Before the start of the study, a sealed envelope listing the
order of the infusions of epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine was handed to an independent individual
who prepared and labeled the infusions with a number
signifying the order. The infusions were prepared and ad￾ministered at fixed infusion rates to what was considered
equipotent doses and not to target a predefined MAP,
equivalent to a dose of norepinephrine 0.10 μg/kg/min,
dopamine 10 μg/kg/min, epinephrine 0.10 μg/kg/min,
and phenylephrine 10 μg/kg/min. The infusion of phenyl￾ephrine alone was not blinded given the long half-life
and administered in all pigs in the end. All animals were
treated with a fluid regime of 1 L of isotonic saline the
first hour and afterwards 900 mL/h, which was shifted
between Ringer acetate and isotonic saline.
CS was induced by stepwise injection of polyvinyl alco￾hol microspheres (Contour™, Boston Scientific, Marlbor￾ough, MA, USA) in the left main coronary artery through
a JL3.5 guide catheter (Launcher, Medtronic Inc., Minne￾apolis, MN, USA) [17]. Hemodynamics were allowed to
stabilize for 2–3 min after each injection before the ad￾ministration of the next injection. Stepwise injections of
microspheres was continued until CS developed, defined
as mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) reduction to <
30% or ≤ 50% of baseline value and/or sustained cardiac
index < 1.5 L/min/m2 for ≥10 min. A median of 12 micro￾sphere injections (interquartile range, 9–17) was required
to induce CS. Following the onset of CS, Impella CP was
advanced from the left femoral artery and placed across
the aortic valve with the inlet in the left ventricle and out￾let in the ascending aorta. The placement of Impella CP
was guided by fluoroscopy, and the maximum pump
speed possible was achieved and maintained during the
entire study. Vasoactive treatment with norepinephrine,
dopamine, or adrenaline was randomized, and the treating
team was blinded to the treating order. The first vaso￾active infusion started following 30 min of Impella CP
Udesen et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:95 Page 2 of 10

support, and each infusion was administered for 30 min.
The initial experimental plan included an Impella CP only
phase (no vasoactive drugs) for 30 mins and a washout
phase (no infusion of vasoactive drugs) between each drug
infusion. However, due to severe hypotension (mean ar￾terial blood pressure (MAP) < 50 mmHg) during the
Impella alone and washout phase in the pilot pigs, the ex￾perimental protocol was changed and Impella support was
combined with a minimum dose of norepinephrine to
maintain MAP > 50 mmHg. Also, the withdrawal and ini￾tiation of subsequent drug infusion overlapped to avoid
any drop in arterial pressure. Vasoactive drug infusion was
withdrawn following any change in hemodynamics (mean
arterial pressure or heart rate). Phenylephrine was admin￾istered in all pigs for 20 min after the completion of all
three catecholamine infusions, followed by euthanization.
Data collection and analysis
Pressure volume parameters
A conductance catheter was inserted through a sheath in
the right carotid artery and advanced retrograde into the LV
and connected to an MPVS Ultra® Pressure-Volume (PV)
loop system (Millar Inc., 6001 Gulf Fwy, Houston, TX,
USA). The PV relationships were available in 9 pigs at all
time points and not available in 1 pig due to disturbance in
the volume signal. The MPVS Ultra® PV loop system was
connected to a PowerLab 16/35 (ADInstruments, Dunedin,
New Zealand), and PV measurements were continuously re￾corded in LabChart Pro (ADInstruments, Dunedin, New
Zealand). Volumes were calibrated using an alpha correc￾tional value, and parallel wall conductance was determined
using the hypertonic saline method. Data recorded from the
conductance catheter comprised of the following: pressure￾volume area (PVA, mmHg × mL), LV end-diastolic pressure
(LVEDP, mmHg), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV, mL),
LV end-systolic pressure (ESP), LV stroke work (SW,
mmHg × mL), LV end-systolic pressure-volume relationship
(Ees), and heart rate (HR, bpm). In all the pigs, balloon oc￾clusion of the inferior vena cava was performed in the
healthy condition at the start of the study, and the acquired
V0 (theoretical ventricular volume when no pressure is gen￾erated) was kept as a constant throughout the study to gen￾erate single-beat estimations of Ees and PVA [18, 19]. Ees
was derived from Ees = LVESP/(LVESV-V0) [20]. Potential
energy (mmHg × mL) was estimated using the formula, PE =
LVESP(LVESV-V0)/2 [21]. All other variables were ex￾tracted from the software program. The slope of the line
from LVEDV to LVESP on the P-V loop was used to calcu￾late arterial elastance (Ea). Ventriculo-arterial coupling was
assessed as the ratio between Ea and Ees [22].
Data collection
Data were collected at seven prespecified time points:
baseline before injection of microspheres, the onset of
CS before initiation of Impella support, after 30 min of
Impella support, at the end of each blinded infusion, and
after 20 min of phenylephrine infusion. Collected data
included systemic and pulmonary artery blood pressure,
central venous blood pressure, blood gasses assessing
oxygen saturation and lactate levels from the femoral
and pulmonary artery, and renal and internal jugular
veins. PV relationships including LVEDP, LVEDV,
LVESP, LVEDP, SW, potential energy, PVA, HR, Ees,
and Ea were determined for the same time points.
Efficacy parameters
The primary efficacy parameters of the study were PVA
and cardiac work (HR × PVA), both parameters closely
related to myocardial oxygen consumption [21]. End￾organ perfusion was estimated based on organ-specific
(cerebral and renal) and overall venous saturations.
Statistical analysis
Baseline variables are presented as mean (95% confi￾dence interval (CI)). A linear mixed model (LMM) was
constructed using individual pigs as subjects for random
factors and sequential experimental stages as fixed re￾peated measurements. The LMM allowed the correlation
between subjects and non-constant variability over time.
It was used to calculate the change in a variable follow￾ing an intervention compared to the control once the
normal distribution of the variables residual was con￾firmed. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for an out￾lier to assess its effect on the overall interpretation of
the results. All statistical tests were performed using
STATA 15. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Hemodynamic changes during CS and after 30 min of
Impella support
Following the induction of CS, defined as a 50% reduction
in SvO2 and cardiac index < 1.5 L/min/m2
, a significant in￾crease in LVEDV and LVEDP was observed concomitant
with a significant reduction in SW and stroke volume
(Table 1 and Fig. 1). The systemic blood pressure was
compromised with a mean MAP of < 40 mmHg, Table 1.
Initiation of Impella CP resulted in a reduction of
LVEDV by 33% and potential energy by > 40% with little
change in SW (Table 1). The PV loop shifted leftward and
became triangular (Fig. 1). Despite Impella support, the
MAP remained < 50 mmHg in 7 pigs. Hence, a low-dose
norepinephrine (median 0.02 μg/kg/min [interquartile
range 0.02, 0.05]) was administered to increase MAP > 50
mmHg. Impella support reduced the cardiac work (HR ×
PVA) via a reduction in both potential energy and HR
(Table 1 and Fig. 1). Although Impella support increased
renal, cerebral, and mixed venous saturations, the levels
did not reach the baseline level, while the lactate levels did
Udesen et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:95 Page 3 of 10

not change significantly during Impella support (Table 1
and Fig. 2). The SvO2 increased during Impella support
from 37% (95% CI 39, 44) to 55% (95% CI 47, 64). A lam￾inar aortic flow was observed after 30 mins of Impella sup￾port in four pigs, suggesting uncoupling between the
ventricular and aortic peak pressure.
Effect of vasoactive agents on cardiac workload during
Impella support
All vasoactive drugs caused a significant increase in
PVA, albeit to different degrees. SW increased signifi￾cantly with all catecholamines, but remained unchanged
with phenylephrine. On the other hand, only phenyleph￾rine caused a significant increase in potential energy. HR
increased with all drugs, except for norepinephrine.
Thus, cardiac work increased significantly with all vaso￾active drugs (Table 2). The average effects on PV loops
are summarized in Fig. 1. In general, catecholamines in￾creased SW and reduced LVESV, thus causing a leftward
shift of the PV loop. In contrast, phenylephrine caused a
rightward shift of the PV loop with an increase in
LVEDV and LVEDP (Fig. 1 and Table 2).
Also, phenylephrine significantly increased right atrial
and mean pulmonary artery pressure, an effect not ob￾served with any of the other vasoactive drugs (Table 2).
Effect of vasoactive agents on end-organ perfusion
during Impella support
SvO2 increased with vasoactive drugs, except phenyleph￾rine which caused a slight decrease [(mean difference
from Impella alone), − 9% [95% CI (− 19% to 0%)], p =
0.063] (Fig. 2). Renal venous saturations also decreased
with phenylephrine while there was no change with any
of the other drugs. Cerebral venous saturation increased
significantly with dopamine, slightly with norepineph￾rine, and did not change with phenylephrine (Fig. 2).
Signs of end-organ ischemia were observed with phenyl￾ephrine with a significant increase in arterial and venous
lactate levels (Fig. 2). In contrast, the catecholamines did
not cause any change in lactate levels, although there
was a trend towards lower lactate concentration with
norepinephrine (p = 0.06) (Fig. 2). The correlation be￾tween SvO2 and cardiac work during different stages of
the study is shown in Fig. 3.
Effect of vasoactive agents on ventricular-arterial
coupling during Impella support
CS was characterized by a decrease in Ees and an in￾crease in ventriculo-arterial decoupling (Ea/Ees) from
1.3 (1.3–2.0) to 7.2 (3.8–10.6) (Table 1). Dopamine sig￾nificantly increased Ees, but no significant changes were

observed with all the other drugs. Phenylephrine signifi￾cantly increased Ea (Table 2). Consequently, ventriculo￾arterial coupling significantly improved with dopamine
(p = 0.03), a trend towards improvement was observed
with epinephrine (p = 0.09), but remained unchanged
with phenylephrine and norepinephrine.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the
effect of equipotent doses of commonly used vasoactive
agents in combination with a microaxial flow pump.
Despite the increase in oxygen delivery with lowering of
cardiac workload after initiation of Impella support, per￾fusion pressure was not restored in the majority of pigs,
which is why additional vasoactive therapy seems un￾avoidable. The addition of a catecholamine increased
LVESP and SvO2 but at the expense of increased cardiac
work (most for dopamine). However, vasoconstriction
with phenylephrine caused an increase in cardiac work
without any increase in oxygen delivery (decreased SvO2
and increased arterial lactate). Thus, a support strategy
based on Impella CP and low-dose catecholamine (nor￾epinephrine) seems optimal to balance oxygen delivery
and LV unloading.
Patients with AMICS have critically low blood pressures,
which may aggravate tissue hypoxia and cause decreased
coronary blood flow even in the non-infarcted myocar￾dium if the vicious cycle is not interrupted [7]. Impella is
used in AMICS to support the flow of oxygenated blood
via continuous forward flow from the LV to the aorta,
thereby augmenting CO while unloading the LV [14]. In
this study, initiation of Impella support decreased cardiac
work through a reduction in LV potential energy, and the
PV loop shape changed to triangular (Fig. 1). Despite
Impella support, the mean arterial pressure remained <
50 mmHg in 7 of 10 pigs and oxygen delivery was al￾though improved not restored to pre shock level (Fig. 3).
However, increased blood pressure does not automatically
translate into an increased oxygen delivery [23] as an in￾crease in MAP can be obtained by increasing CO or

vascular resistance via vasoconstriction [13]. Vasoactive
agents can increase perfusion pressure by either stimulat￾ing cardiac β-adrenoceptors, thus enhancing CO or by
stimulating vascular α-adrenoceptors, causing an increase
in systemic vascular resistance [24]. Since phenylephrine
only stimulates the α-adrenoceptors [25], it caused a high
afterload and a significant increase in potential energy (en￾ergy wasting) with a rightward shift of the PV loop (Fig. 1)
accompanied by reduced oxygen delivery and increased
arterial lactate levels (Fig. 2). It is likely that the shift in
preload, afterload, and increase in HR also led to compro￾mised coronary blood flow. Overall, catecholamines im￾proved oxygen delivery via an increase in both perfusion
pressure and flow, but the associated LV energy costs var￾ied among the different drugs. Particularly, dopamine in￾creased cardiac work via an increase in both HR and PVA.
The present study suggests that the optimal balance
between maximum oxygen delivery and the least expense
in cardiac work is achieved with norepinephrine where
HR increased least (Fig. 3) and the beneficial effect is in
accordance with other experimental findings [26].
The finding from this study that the Impella alone was
insufficient to increase MAP and SvO2 to pre shock
values is in line with observational studies reporting fre￾quent use of concomitant vasoactive agents with Impella
support in CS [10, 27–29]. Thus, vasoactive agents are
often unavoidable for the treatment of AMICS sup￾ported by Impella CP, irrespective of their potential side
effects [10, 30]. Currently, concomitant use of vasoactive
agents during mechanical LV unloading in CS is based
on expert consensus and local practice. Norepinephrine
is recommended as the first-line therapy if perfusion
pressure is low [31], mainly based on the Sepsis Occur￾rence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP-II) trial. The SOAP￾Fig. 2 End-organ perfusion. The relative mean difference during interventions compared to Impella alone. Impella alone is represented by the

II trial demonstrated a lower risk of arrhythmia with
norepinephrine among patients with shock. Moreover,
norepinephrine was associated with improved survival
compared to dopamine in a subgroup analysis of 280 pa￾tients with CS [32]. Avoidance of arrhythmia is pivotal
in patients treated with the microaxial flow pump, given
their functional dependence on adequate blood delivery
from the right heart (preload). A recent randomized
study that compared norepinephrine and epinephrine in
57 patients with AMICS demonstrated similar effects on
perfusion pressure, but in the epinephrine group, a
higher incidence of prolonged lactate-acidosis, tachycar￾dia, and refractory CS was observed, leading to prema￾ture termination of the study [33]. In the present study,
we did not observe any adverse metabolic effects of epi￾nephrine, which may be a result of dosage or duration of
therapy. However, we observed tachycardia with epi￾nephrine as well as for dopamine and phenylephrine,
which is concerning both in terms of adequate coronary
perfusion and risk of arrhythmia.
The increase in HR with phenylephrine is intriguing,
and current study offers no direct insight in the reason
for this. The increase was not driven by one or two out￾liers or due to cardiac arrhythmias. Rather, we observed
a uniform increase in HR. Whether this was caused by
reflex tachycardia due to reduction in perfusion (reduc￾tion in SvO2) or whether it was a direct effect of the
drug in Danish landrace pigs is speculative. Compared
to dopamine that also caused significant increase in HR,
the effect of dopamine was associated with increase in
SvO2 whereas phenylephrine was not, suggesting the un￾favorable effect of phenylephrine not solely to be driven

by HR. Thus, the current study warrants caution to use
of vasoconstrictor alone while on LV support with
Impella CP in AMICS.
Limitations
In this study, vasoactive drugs were administered at what
is considered equipotent doses and not titrated against a
predefined target MAP, as done in the clinical setting. The
doses of dopamine and phenylephrine used in this study
might have been too low compared to the new vasoactive
inotropic score [34]. In our opinion, a higher dose of
phenylephrine would not be beneficial given the adverse
effect of the low dose used in this study. Also, increasing
the dopamine dose would result in vasoconstriction
(alpha-receptor stimulation) with the risk of negative im￾pact on cardiac work and coronary perfusion. The experi￾mental setting based on a standard operating procedure
used in this study aids in reproducibility and reducing the
variability involved in testing the physiological effects of
drug therapies in an acute setting. A high number of ani￾mals would have been required to compare the effects
inter-individual. Despite being clearly superior, this was
not feasible in terms of time required and expenses. Thus,
we chose to do the cross-over design and make intra￾individual comparisons to allow for a lower number of an￾imals. However, the small sample size of the study is a
limitation and may result in a type II error. Given the risk
of hemodynamic instability, we did not include washout
periods between drug infusions. Nonetheless, we do not
expect a carryover effect of a previous drug infusion as the
vasoactive agents have a short half-life, and the measure￾ments were taken at the end of each infusion. The diuresis
was not recorded systematically as we in design of study
considered the individual duration of intervention too
short to have confidence that the diuresis during each
intervention was not mostly carry over effect of previous.
The crossover design and statistical analyses were under￾taken considering the potential effect of the timing of the
interventions. Phenylephrine was administered in all the
pigs at the end of the experiment due to its long half-life.
The pigs may have developed more severe CS in the end,
which could have affected the results. We attempted to
adjust for this effect by using the linear mixed model and
believe that the adverse effect of phenylephrine observed
in this study reflects the drug’s effect and not a time￾dependent artifact. The experimental observation period
in this study is probably too short and may not reflect the
long-term effects of concomitant vasoactive treatment and
LV unloading in AMICS. Given the similar body size and
adrenoceptor distribution and function among pigs and
humans, the results may apply to the human treatment of
CS [24].
Conclusion
In this preclinical study, mechanical circulatory support
with Impella CP in severe CS lowered cardiac workload,
but perfusion pressure was inadequate in most pigs. The
addition of catecholamines increased perfusion pressure
and oxygen delivery but at the expense of increased car￾diac work, most for dopamine. Vasoconstriction with
phenylephrine caused an increase in cardiac work without
any increase in oxygen delivery. Thus, a support strategy
based on Impella CP and low-dose catecholamine prefera￾bly norepinephrine to avoid arrhythmias seems optimal to
balance oxygen delivery and cardiac work. The study

results suggest great caution when using vasoconstrictors
such as phenylephrine in the setting of CS.
