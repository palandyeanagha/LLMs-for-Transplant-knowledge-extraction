Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in glomerular diseases like diabetic
nephropathy. Glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) glycocalyx covers the luminal aspect of the glomerular capillary wall and
makes an important contribution to the glomerular barrier. ROS are known to depolymerise glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
chains of proteoglycans, which are crucial for the barrier function of GEnC glycocalyx. The aim of this study is to investigate
the direct effects of ROS on the structure and function of GEnC glycocalyx using conditionally immortalised human GEnC.
ROS were generated by exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Biosynthesis and cleavage of GAG chains was analyzed by
radiolabelling (S35 and 3
H-glucosamine). GAG chains were quantified on GEnC surface and in the cell supernatant using
liquid chromatography and immunofluorescence techniques. Barrier properties were estimated by measuring trans￾endothelial passage of albumin. ROS caused a significant loss of WGA lectin and heparan sulphate staining from the surface
of GEnC. This lead to an increase in trans-endothelial albumin passage. The latter could be inhibited by catalase and
superoxide dismutase. The effect of ROS on GEnC was not mediated via the GAG biosynthetic pathway. Quantification of
radiolabelled GAG fractions in the supernatant confirmed that ROS directly caused shedding of HS GAG. This finding is
clinically relevant and suggests a mechanism by which ROS may cause proteinuria in clinical conditions associated with high
oxidative stress.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease remains one of the principle causes of
mortality in both the developed and the developing worlds [1].
Scientific and clinical research in the last two decades has
confirmed the associations between microalbuminuria, cardiovas￾cular disease and progressive kidney disease [2]. This is
particularly evident in systemic diseases like diabetes and
hypertension where the onset of microalbuminuria strongly
predicts death [3,4]. Although, generalized damage to the vascular
endothelium is believed to offer a plausible explanation of the link
between the kidney and systemic circulation, the precise mecha￾nisms of injury are yet to be elucidated [5].
Vascular oxidative stress is an important factor leading to
endothelial dysfunction and has been identified as a significant
contributor to the progression of atherosclerosis and other vascular
complications of diabetes [6,7,]. Excessive generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) is central to the pathogenesis of diabetic
nephropathy [8]. Proteinuria heralds the onset of kidney disease in
diabetes. The wall of the glomerular capillary is the primary site of
sieving action in the kidney and is known as the glomerular
filtration barrier (GFB) [9]. The GFB is uniquely adapted to be
‘selectively permeable’ i.e. impermeable to macromolecules but
allow relatively free passage of water and solutes and is very tightly
regulated in health. This property of the GFB depends on the
combined action of its components: the podocytes, glomerular
basement membrane and the endothelium with its glycocalyx [10].
The roles of glomerular podocytes and the glomerular basement
membrane in the pathogenesis of proteinuric kidney diseases have
been described extensively. However, due to difficulties in isolation
and lack of experimental models, the vital contribution of the
glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC), and particularly its glycocalyx,
has only recently been appreciated [11–14].
GEnC are highly specialized cells whose luminal surface is
covered by a layer of glycocalyx 200–400 nm in thickness and
which covers both fenestral and inter-fenestral domains
[15,16,17]. The glycocalyx is a dynamic hydrated layer largely
composed of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and
adsorbed plasma proteins [14,18]. Proteoglycans, particularly
heparan sulphate (HS) proteoglycans are largely responsible for
the anionic charge characteristics of the glycocalyx.
Vascular endothelial cells are vulnerable to damage by ROS
and glycocalyx is believed to act as a ‘vasculo-protective shield’
[18]. Hence, endothelial glycocalyx is a major site of action of
circulating ROS and cytokines produced during oxidative stress
[19–21]. Intact endothelial glycocalyx also has binding sites for
anti-oxidant enzymes like xanthine oxido-reductase [22] and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55852

endothelial superoxide dismutase (eSOD) [23] so, has its own
capacity to quench free radicals. Therefore, loss of endothelial
glycocalyx exposes the vascular endothelium to the deleterious
effects of ROS, which subsequently leads to endothelial dysfunc￾tion.
These observations are relevant to the glomerular microcircu￾lation particularly in understanding the pathogenesis of protein￾uria in states of high oxidative states. Here we investigate the direct
effects of exogenous ROS on the key components of human GEnC
glycocalyx and quantify consequent changes in its protein
restrictive barrier function. We test the hypotheses that exposure
to ROS directly alters the critical components of the GEnC
glycocalyx and that these alterations have implications for its
barrier action to the passage of albumin.
Results
ROS Reduce Expression of WGA Lectin and HS GAG
without any Deleterious Effect on Cell Survival
GEnC monolayers exposed to H2O2 reveal a significantly
reduced cell surface binding of WGA lectin compared to control
over 1, 2 and 5 hours (Figure 1A). This is quantified by showing a
significant reduction in the fluorescent intensity after treatment
with H2O2 over 5 hours (Figure 1B). Similarly, there is significant
reduction in the expression of cell surface HS after H2O2
treatment over time (Figure 2A & 2B). This effect of H2O2 on
HS can be blocked if the cells are co-incubated with free radical
scavengers, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (Cat) along
with H2O2. The latter result confirms that the changes seen after
H2O2 are specifically as a result of ROS.
We also tested the GEnC monolayers for any adverse cytotoxic
effect of H2O2. Exposure to H2O2 does not affect the survival or
morphology of GEnC at the concentrations of 50–200 mM
(Figure 3).
ROS Exposure does not Alter Biosynthesis of GAG Chains
Study of the tritiated-glucosamine incorporated into the
glycocalyx of GEnC (a measure of both sulphated and non￾sulphated GAG chains, as glucosamine is a component of the
disaccharide chain of GAG ‘‘backbone’’) revealed that exposure to
H2O2 for 48 h did not cause a significant change compared to
controls. This is evident (Figure 4A) in the cumulative data of the
isolated fractions. Incorporation of S35 was also not significantly
changed by H2O2 (Figure 4B). These results imply the marked
reduction in lectin binding and HS expression observed in the

previous experiment is not a result of reduction in GAG
biosynthesis.
ROS Leads to Increased Cleavage of Sulphated GAG from
GEnC Glycocalyx
Following the results from the GAG biosynthesis experiment.
We then wanted to quantify cleaved GAG residues in the GEnC
supernatant after exposure to H2O2. This was done using two
techniques: Alcian Blue assay and quantification of radiolabelled
GAG fractions in the supernatant after exposure to H2O2. Alcian
Blue has high affinity to sulphated GAG residues due to its high
anionic density. Results show a significant increase in the Alcian
Blue binding in the supernatant of the GEnC exposed to H2O2
compared to controls (Figure 5A) suggesting cleavage of GAG
chains. Further, radiolabelling studies to characterize the GAG in
supernatant show markedly elevated levels of fractions with HS
(Figure 5B) rather than HA (Figure 5C) confirming the loss of
highly anionic sulphated GAG. This result confirms that the
apparent reduction in the expression of cell surface HS
demonstrated on immunofluorescence is as a result of direct
cleavage from the GEnC surface.
ROS Transiently Reduce Trans-endothelial Electrical
Resistance (TEER) of GEnC Monolayers
GEnC monolayers treated with H2O2 show an immediate, but
non-sustained reduction in the TEER measured in a real time
analyzer. H2O2 is added at time zero, showing significant effect in
less than 2 min with maximal effect at 30 min showing reduction
in TEER compared to control GEnC treated with vehicle only
(Figure 6). This effect completely resolves by 90 min with TEER
returning to baseline.
ROS Cause a Significant and Sustained Increase in
Passage of Albumin Across GEnC Monolayers
In the light of the findings on TEER described above and to
avoid a confounding effect of reduced TEER (suggesting increased

nuclear staining (DAPI) which is used as a control for cell numbers. The top bar graph shows significant reduction in HS after 1 h and 2 h of H2O2
treatment (n = 11; p,0.001, t-test). Adding SOD and catalase at the same time as H2O2 blocks the effect of H2O2 analyzed at 2 h (n = 11; p,0.01, t￾test). The lower bar graph confirms the effects of H2O2 can be reproduced at 5 h (n = 16; p,0.01, t-test).

junctional permeability), estimation of albumin passage across
GEnC monolayers was performed after 120 min of exposure.
H2O2 significantly increased passage of albumin across GEnC
monolayers in a dose dependant manner (Figure 7A). The effect of
H2O2 treatment was significant at 100 mM and 200 mM. In a set
of separate experiments, the effect of H2O2 at 100 mM could be
partially blocked with free radical scavengers, superoxide dis￾mutase and catalase (Figure 7B).
Discussion
In our study we used human GEnC that are conditionally
immortalized and express the typical phenotypic characteristics.
These cells have been well studied previously and express
glycocalyx under culture conditions [12,14]. There were no
significant changes in GEnC survival after exposure to H2O2 as
judged by production of formazan using the WST-1 assay. GEnC
were also carefully monitored by phase contrast microscopy during
experiments and no significant problems with monolayer forma￾tion or cell detachment were noted at the concentrations of H2O2
used for treatments in experiments. Our results demonstrate loss of
glycocalyx from the surface of GEnC after exposure to H2O2. This
was evident from significant loss of WGA lectin and HS
immunostaining from the surface of GEnC. The loss of GAG
from GEnC cell surface was associated with markedly increased
HS GAG fractions in the supernatant. This was first demonstrated
using an Alcian Blue colorimetric assay (indicating loss of anionic
residues) and then upon quantification of radiolabelled GAG
fractions separated by liquid chromatography. Analysis of
incorporated radiolabeled 3H-glucosamine and S35 was used to
study biosynthesis of GAG over 48 h after treatment with H2O2.
Our results did not show significant changes in the biosynthesis of
either total or sulphated GAG chains after exposure to of H2O2
over a 48 h period of analysis. The effect of ROS is short-lived and
the later finding confirms their direct action on the sulphated
GAG as suggested by the Alcian blue binding experiments. ROS
reduced the TEER of GEnC monolayers and increased the
paracellular transport. The effect was immediate, lasting for
90 min with maximal effect at 30 min. The relatively short term
and reversible effect of ROS (particularly H2O2) has also been
previously reported [24] and is due to increased gaps in the
endothelial junctions [25] and mediated via Ca+ signaling
pathways [26]. ROS caused an increase in the macromolecular
passage in a dose dependant manner. The changes observed
showing cleavage of HS after ROS coupled with increase in
macromolecular passage follow a similar pattern seen after
treatment with HS degrading enzymes reported previously [14].
It is therefore highly probable that loss of HS from GEnC
glycocalyx after to ROS is likely responsible for the increase in
macromolecular passage observed in the FITC-albumin experi￾ments. It was also reassuring to see that effect of ROS could be
partly inhibited by free radical scavengers.
ROS are well known to depolymerise and damage the structure
of HS, CS and HA GAG [27]. Non-sulphated GAG, HA appears
to be particularly susceptible to damage from ROS [28]. Loss of
sulphation from GAG chains particularly HS is a known feature in
diabetes and is linked to chronic hyperglycemia [29]. This line of
evidence suggests that the changes in the chemical structure of

ANOVA).

GAG, particularly loss of sulphation may render the GEnC
glycocalyx more susceptible to oxidant damage. Interestingly, our
results also show that ROS largely cleaves sulphated GAG (HS)
from the GEnC glycocalyx.
H2O2 is a major source of ROS in the microvascular
endothelium and is widely used to model oxidative stress in vitro
and in vivo [30,31]. H2O2 injected directly into the renal artery
causes reversible nephrotic range proteinuria in an experimental
model without any evidence of ultrastructural abnormality in the
GFB [32]. Similarly, ROS have been shown to cause a defect in
both size and charge selectivity of the GFB with an intact podocyte
and GBM structure in an ischaemia-reperfusion injury model [33].
Onset of proteinuria following generation of oxidative stress in
mouse glomeruli has also been associated with increased excretion
of HS GAG. Both proteinuria and loss of glomerular HS GAG
could be reversed upon blockade of ROS [34]. Indeed, hydroxyl
radicals generated by H2O2 are also known to depolymerise HS
GAG [35]. In the absence of direct experimental investigation, the
evidence above suggests a role of GEnC glycocalyx in the
dysfunction of the GFB caused by oxidant injury.
The results of our study suggest that ROS disrupt GEnC
glycocalyx through a direct mechanism of action without affecting
the GAG biosynthetic pathway. This is the first study that
elucidates a potential mechanism by which ROS can disrupt the
barrier properties of GEnC glycocalyx. These findings suggest that
GEnC glycocalyx plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of
oxidant induced glomerular injury. Excessive generation of ROS is
associated with the pathogenesis of a number of glomerular
diseases including diabetic nephropathy [36] and acute kidney
injury due to ischemia-reperfusion injury and sepsis [37–39].
Future efforts should be focused to dissect the molecular pathways
in order to develop new molecular therapeutic targets.
Materials and Methods
GEnC Culture
We used a normal human conditionally immortalised GEnC
line as described in detail previously [12]. Briefly, primary culture
GEnC were exposed to separate retroviral vectors transducing a
temperature sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen and the
catalytic subunit of human telomerase. At the permissive

treatment of GEnC with controls versus H2O2. The experiment utilizes Alcian Blue dye that binds to the anionic residues of proteoglycans. Cumulative
data from individual experiments shows significant increase in the quantity of alcian blue staining in the supernatant after H2O2. This confirms
cleavage of GAG residues from the surface of GEnC after exposure to ROS (n = 3 experiments (individual experiment replicates = 8–12), p,0.05). B

fractions in the supernatant compared to controls. (n = 4; p = 0.053; t test).

temperature of 33uC the tsSV40LT transgene is activated causing
cell proliferation (without telomere shortening) while at 37uC the
transgene is inactivated rendering cells non-proliferative and
quiescent. Conditionally immortalised GEnC were used for
experiments after maintaining them at the non-permissive
temperature for 7 days. GEnC were cultured in endothelial
growth medium-2 microvascular (EGM2-MV, Cambrex, Woking￾ham, UK) containing foetal calf serum (5%) and growth factors as
supplied with the exception of VEGF.
Generation of ROS and GEnC Survival Assay
H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat: 516813) was used at concentrations
from 50–500 mM in preliminary experiments to determine cellular
toxicity. H2O2 and hydroxyl radical (OH-) acts as ROS. This was
assessed by phase contrast microscopy. Further, a cell survival
assay was performed using a commercially available WST-1 assay
kit (Roche, Germany). For the WST-1 assay, GEnC were
incubated with 1:10 dilution of WST-1 reagent for 2 h. 200 ml
of media from each well was pipetted into a 96 well plate and
analysed on a spectrophotometer at 420–480 nm.
100 mM of H2O2 was taken as the optimal concentration (no
evidence of cell toxicity) for all experiments:‘ROS media’. SOD
(from bovine erythrocytes; Sigma-Aldrich S25115) and catalase
(from bovine liver; Sigma-Aldrich C1345) were used to scavenge
ROS. The powder form was solubilized in serum free media and
used at 300 U/ml and 1200 U/ml respectively. For inhibition of
ROS: both SOD and catalase were added at the same time as
100 mM of H2O2. These concentrations were derived from a
previously published protocol [24].
Metabolic Labeling and Extraction of Proteoglycans
Metabolic labeling of GAG was achieved by culturing GEnC in
media containing 50 mCi/ml [S35] sulfate and 20 mCi/ml D-
[3H3
] glucosamine (Amersham Biosciences). After 10 days, the
media in the ‘control’ GEnC was replaced by serum free media
(vehicle) whereas the test GEnC media was changed to ROS
media (100 mM of H2O2). Next, S35-sulphate and 3H3
-glucos￾amine was added to the respective media for 48 h. Medium was
collected and filtrated through a 0.22 mm filter (Millipore, MA).
Cells were extracted in RIPA lysis buffer containing 10% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 10% (m/v) SDS, 10% (m/v) sodium deoxycholate
and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Germany) in
phosphate buffered saline and filtrated through a 0.22 mm filter.
Protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit
(Pierce Labs, IL). For radiolabelling studies to estimate cleavage of
GAG in the supernatant, cells were treated with 20 uCi/ml of D￾3H3 glucosamine and incubated for 24 hours. The media was then
removed and cells gently washed in PBS. Serum free media was
then added, containing 100 uM H2O2 for 2 h. Media was then
collected and concentrated using a 3 kDa molecular weight cut off
Millipore filter and run on the Anion Exchange Liquid Chroma￾tography to isolate fractions.
Isolation of Proteoglycans
A HiTrapH DEAE FF (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) column
connected to a A¨ KTATM FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences)
was equilibrated with 6 M urea, 0.5 M NaOAc, pH 5.8, 5 mg/ml
bovine albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 (equilibration buffer). Sample
was applied to the column at 1 ml/min and subsequently merged
with column matrix for 15 min. The column was then washed
successively with 10 ml of three different buffers, at 10 ml/min. 1)
Equilibration buffer, 2) 6 M urea, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mg/ml
bovine albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100; and 3) 50 mM Tris pH 7.5.
The bound proteoglycans were eluted with 4 M guanidine-HCl,
50 mM NaOAc, pH 5.8, 5 mg/ml bovine albumin, 0.2% Triton
X-100 and collected in 1 ml fractions. All fractions were quantified
by liquid scintillation counting on a Beta Counter LS6500
(Beckman Coulter) with Ready Safe cocktail (Beckman Coulter).
Immunofluorescence and Lectin Binding
Cells were seeded on glass cover slips and cultured for 24 h
before exposing to either control or ROS media for 48 h, and
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Coverslips were then
incubated either in blocking solution (5% FCS and 0.05%
Tween20 in PBS) followed by antibody incubation for HS
(1:500; HepSS-1, US Biologicals, Swampscott, MA) or directly
with FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, from
Triticum vulgaris) lectin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 2 ml/
ml for 30 min. WGA (binds to the carbohydrate moieties N-acetyl
glucosamine and N-acetyl neuraminic acid on glycocalyx constit￾uents). Nuclear staining was demonstrated using 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI). Coverslips were examined using a Leitz
DMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Solms, Germany). Fluo￾rescence intensity was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader
as previously described [14].
Alcian Blue Dye Binding Assay for Quantitation of
Sulphated GAG
GEnC were treated with 100 mM H2O2 or vehicle in serum free
media for 1 h. Conditioned media were collected and precipitated
in 95% ethanol containing 1% potassium acetate. After centrifu￾gation at 500 g and 4 degree C for 10 min the pellet was
resuspended in 100 ml PBS. A 50 ml sample was incubated with
200 ml alcian blue solution for 15 min at room temperature.
Absorbance was then read at 490 nm. The ionic interaction
between the cationic dye (Alcian blue) and the negatively charged
GAG is proportional to the number of negative charges present.
The concentration of sulphated GAGs in the samples was
quantitated using a chondroitin sulphate standard curve (0.02–
0.313 mg/ml).

Measurement of Trans-endothelial Electrical Resistance
Trans-endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) was measured
using an automated bioimpedance sensing system (ECISTM;
Applied Biophysics Inc, NY) as described previously [14]. GEnC
were seeded in 8 well, 10 electrode per well arrays (8W10E)
supplied by the manufacturer. 100 mM of H2O2 was added to the
treatment wells at time point zero. The resistance is reported in V
and the measurement from each well, at a given time point, is an
average from 10 electrodes.
Measurement of Transendothelial Protein Passage
GEnC were seeded on polycarbonate supports (0.4 mm pore
size, 0.5 cm2 surface area) in tissue-culture inserts (1 cm diameter;
Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and treated with ROS
or control media as above for 2 h prior to measuring passage of
FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) across the
monolayer as described previously [14]. Briefly, the medium in the
insert was replaced with 500 ml of SFM containing 0.5 mg/ml
FITC-BSA; that in the well was replaced with 500 ml of SFM
containing 0.5 mg/ml unlabeled BSA (Sigma). At 1, 2, and 3 h,
100 ml aliquots were removed and replaced with 100 ml of SFM
containing unlabeled BSA (0.5 mg/ml). The fluorescence of the
aliquots was measured as above, and the cumulative amount of
FITC-BSA passing through the monolayer was calculated by
reference to a set of standard dilutions.
Statistical Analyses
Graph Pad Prism-4 statistical software package (Graph Pad
Software Inc. San Diego, CA) was used for all analyses, including
