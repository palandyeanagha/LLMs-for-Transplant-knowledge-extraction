Abstract
Background: The prevalence of portopulmonary hypertension
(PPHTN) in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites is
unknown. Its presence may preclude patients from receiving a
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or liver
transplantation as a definitive treatment for their end stage
cirrhosis.
Purpose: To determine the prevalence, possible aetiological factors,
and predictive factors for the development of PPHTN in these
patients.
Methods: Sixty two patients (53 males, nine females; mean age
54.5 (1.4) years) with biopsy proven cirrhosis and refractory ascites
underwent angiographic measurements of pulmonary and
splanchnic haemodynamics. Endothelin 1 levels were measured
from the pulmonary artery. Forty nine patients underwent
radionuclide angiography for measurements of central blood
volume, pulmonary vascular, and cardiac chamber volumes. Forty
seven patients also underwent two dimensional echocardiography
for measurements of cardiac structural and functional parameters.
Cardiac output, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance
were calculated.
Results: Ten patients (16.1%) fulfilled the criteria for PPHTN
(mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mm Hg and pulmonary
vascular resistance ≥120 dyn×s/cm5), with significantly higher
mean right atrial (15.4 (1.2) v 7.9 (0.5) mm Hg; p<0.001), and
right ventricular pressures (24.7 (1.5) v 14.7 (0.6) mm Hg;
p<0.001), and endothelin 1 levels (3.04 (0.40) v 1.98 (0.12) pg/ml;
p=0.02). No significant differences in any of the other parameters
measured were detected between the two groups. A right atrial
pressure of ≥14 mm Hg had a 83% positive predictive value for the


presence of PPHTN.
Conclusions: Portopulmonary hypertension is common in cirrhosis
with refractory ascites, possibly due to excess endothelin 1 in the
pulmonary circulation. An elevated right atrial pressure ≥14 mm
Hg predicts the presence of PPHTN, which may be helpful in
deciding management options in these patients.
