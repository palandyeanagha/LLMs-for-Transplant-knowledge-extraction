Unilateral Renal Hypoplasia with
Hypertension (Ask-Upmark Kidney)

Congenital unilateral renal hypoplasia with hypertension was
first reported by Ask-Upmark (1929). Habib et al. (1965) re￾ported nine more cases of this rare condition, which they
called "segmental hypoplasia of the kidney." It has a typical
histological picture, affects primarily children and young
adults, and is sufficiently characteristic for it to be diagnosed
and treated accordingly. A case is reported here.
Case Report
The patient, a 17-year-old girl, was admitted to hospital in 1966
because of severe headaches, vertigo, and general fatigue of two
months' duration. Her blood pressure was 220/115 mm Hg supine
and 220/150 mm Hg erect. The appearance of the retina was
normal. A chest radiograph showed moderate enlargement of the
left ventricle, and the electrocardiogram showed left ventricular
hypertrophy. The blood urea was 45 mg/ 100 ml, creatinine clear￾ance 65 ml/min, and the urinary sediment contained 3-4 leucocytes.
There was no proteinuria and urinary cultures were sterile. The
haemoglobin was 14 g/100 and the white blood cells 8,000 with a
normal differential count. Liver function tests were normal. An
intravenous pyelogram showed that the right kidney was 3-5 cm
smaller than the left, the upper right calyx showed signs of
clubbing, and the upper and lower poles showed lobulation. The
dye concentration appeared equal on both sides. A renogram after
intravenous injection of 15 uCi l13I-labelled orthoiodohippurate
showed diminished concentration and prolonged transit time in
the right kidney. The angiotensin infusion test was negative and
the Stamey test gave equivocal results. Renoangiography showed
normal renal arteries on both sides but a paucity of vessels in the
upper pole of the right kidney with lack of arborization and a
tapering of the arterioles (fig. 1). In the nephrographic phase the
effect was stronger on the right side, suggesting a paradoxical
nephrographic effect (fig. 2).
A tentative diagnosis of contracted right kidney after pyelone￾phritis was unsatisfactory in view of the peculiar shape of the small
kidney, the absence of a history of recurrent urinary tract infec￾tions, and the absence of anomaly of the urinary tract. Bilateral
renal biopsy specimens showed some sclerosis of the arteries and

arterioles, more prominent on the left side. In line with current
opinion in -1966 it was decided that the patient was unlikely to
benefit from right nephrectomy, and she was treated conservatively.
During the next four years the patient had recurrent urinary
tract infections. Despite control of her hypertension with methyl￾dopa and a low salt diet grade II hypertensive changes developed
in the retina, the blood urea rose progressively to 70 mg/100 ml,
and her creatine clearance decreased to 40 ml/min. Traces of
protein appeared in the urine. Selective renin studies in 1970

showed renin concentration from the right renal vein to be 2,715
ng/100 ml and from the left 345 ng/100 ml. In view of these
findings a right nephrectomy was performed.
During the first postoperative year the patient's blood pressure
dropped to normal and the hypertensive retinal changes regressed.
The creatinine clearance stabilized at 55 ml/min, the blood urea
was 60 mg/100 ml, and the serum electrolytes were normal. After
two years the blood pressure again rose to 180/110 mm Hg. She
responded well to treatment with propranolol.
PATHOLOGY
Renal Biopsy.-The arteriole walls were thickened by deposition
of homogenous, acidophil, hyaline substance. The arterial arterio￾sclerotic .oanges consisted mainly of fibrous thic g of the
intima, causing narrowing of the lumen. There was fraying and
splitting of the internal elastic lamina, mainly in the arteries of the
"healthy" kidney. Slight glomerular ischaemic changes and tubular
atrophy were noted. No histological findings compatible with
pyelonephritis were found.
Excised Kidney.-The excised right kidney measured 6-0 by
5 0 by 3-0 cm and weighed 80 g. Two deep surface grooves caused
a course lobulation typical of renal segmental hypoplasia (Ask￾Upmark kidney) (fig. 3). Frontal section through the kidney showed
that the grooves appearing on the capsular surface marked the
sites of hypoplastic segments, with underlying, calyx-like recesses
of the renal pelvis. The number of the renal pyramids was reduced
to four. The renal artery was thin, with a narrow lumen.
FIG. 3-Typica gross features of Ask-Upmark kidney.
Microscopically (see fig. 4) the hypoplastic segments consisted
of cystically dilated tubules lined with a single layer of flat epithel￾ium and containing a colloid-like substance. Between these thyroid￾like structures a moderate amount of connective tissue and thick￾walled arterioles and small arteries were seen. The thyroid-like
tubules were devoid of glomeruli. There was no inflammatory in￾filtration.
Comment
In 1,200 necropsies and 100 nephrectomies Ljungqvist and
Lagergren (1962) found only three cases of Ask-Upmark kid￾ney. Its typical gross features are hypoplasia, an abnormally
small number of pyramids, and a transverse surface groove.
The syndrome occurs more commonly in girls and presents
with hypertension before the age of 12. Headache is a leading
symptom either in isolation or in association with hypertens￾ive encephalopathy. The urine volume in these cases is usual￾ly normal, with a normal concentration, and seldom exceeds
2,000 ml/24 hr. Proteinuria, when present, is never more than
1 gm/24 hr. The case described here has these characteristics,
except that the patient was aged 17.

(H.E. x 30.)
The following facts support the view that this unilateral
segmental renal hypoplasia is congenital and also differentiate
the condition from chronic pyelonephritis or atrophic segmen￾tation of vascular origin. (1) The reduction in the size and
weight of the affected kidney are rarely associated with in￾flammation or vascular changes. (2) The renal artery is small
and this is not secondary to atherosclerotic changes, since the
walls of the renal artery in this nephropathy are always nor￾mal. (3) The segments affected may be in the cortex and
medulla of one or several renal lobes, but they do not have
the fan-like distribution characteristic of chronic pyelo￾nephritis and renal infarctions.
The thyroid-like dilatation of the tubules considered as
pathognomic for chronic pyelonephritis (Weiss and Parker,
1939) has also been observed in renal ischaemias and hypo￾plasias. In addition Fahr (1938) and Batzenschlager et al.
(1962) regard the complete disappearance of the glomeruli
in the cortex to be characteristic of segmental hypoplasia and
not of chronic- pyelonephritis. The presence of both arteriolar
and glomerular- sclerosis secondary to hypertension in the
non-hypoplastic part of the kidney explains why nephrectomy
does not usually abolish the hypertension (Bernstein, 1968). It
may also explain the mild functional impairment in the
healthy kidney.
The cause of unilateral small kidney with hypertension has
almost always been attributed in English medical literature
to pyelonephritis or primary hypoplasia, and the early des￾criptions of Ask-Upmark and Habib et al. have been consis￾tently overlooked.
