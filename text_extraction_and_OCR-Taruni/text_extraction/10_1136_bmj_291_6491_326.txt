Economics of coronary artery bypass grafting
ALAN WILLIAMS
Abstract
To decide whether the number of operations for coronary artery
bypass grafting should be increased, maintained at the present
levels, or decreased we need to know how cost effective they are
relative to other claimants on the resources of the National
Health Service. For this purpose effectiveness is taken to be the
effect on life expectancy adjusted for the quality of life. In an
assessment of the cost per quality adjusted life year gained
coronary artery bypass grafting rates well for cases of severe
angina and extensive coronary artery disease. The cost, how￾ever, rises sharply for less severe cases. Bypass grafting seems to
compare favourably with valve replacement for aortic stenosis
and implantation of pacemakers for heart block; it is distinctly
better than heart transplantation and the treatment of end stage
renal failure but is probably less cost effective than hip replace￾ment. If the number of operations for coronary artery bypass
grafting were to increase it would be a fairly strong claimant
only if restricted to the most severe cases.
The data on which these judgments are based are crude and in
need of refinement. The methodology is powerful, far reaching,
and open to comment.
Introduction
The report of a consensus development conference on coronary
artery bypass surgery recommended a large increase in the number
of such operations in the United Kingdom, to 300 for every million
of the population, "if this represents provision for high benefit
patients."'I The report acknowledged, however, that such a develop￾ment would require considerable funds and that "the problem of
assessment of priorities remains. This in turn should take account of
estimations of the relative cost effectiveness of other procedures
competing for resources."
The report went on to say "We were impressed by one method of
measurement combining quality and duration of life. Further
development of this approach is recommended so that it can be of
help not only in comparison between coronary artery bypass surgery
and other priorities but also between the various subgroups of
patients whom it is proposed should be treated by coronary artery
bypass surgery. Such techniques would also help to identify health
service estimates which are being continued despite low benefit."
This paper presents the economic analysis given to the panel at
the consensus development conference in the hope that this will lead
to a better understanding of the methodology and enable better data
to be collected and deployed than the rather crude data used here.
The problem
The objective of economic appraisal is to ensure that as much benefit as
possible is obtained from the resources devoted to health care. In principle
the benefit is measured in terms of the effect on life expectancy adjusted for
the quality of life. The resources for health care should include not only costs
to the service but also costs borne by patients and their families. Given the
amount of unemployment, which is expected to persist in the near future,
increases in production that might be associated with employment gains
have been disregarded. Procedures should be ranked so that activities that
generate more gains to health for every £ of resources take priority over those
that generate less; thus the general standard of health in the community
would be correspondingly higher.
Coronary artery bypass grafting is one of many contenders for additional
resources. Ideally, all such contenders should be compared each time a
decision on allocation of resources is made to test which should be cut back
and which should be expanded. The central issue before the conference was
whether the number of operations for coronary artery bypass grafting should
be increased, decreased, or maintained at its present level. To address this
problem three factors need to be considered: firstly, which groups ofpatients
stand to gain the most and the least from such operations; secondly, whether
any of these groups of patients gain more for every £ of resources than
patients awaiting other types of cardiac surgery-for example, transplanta￾tion, replacement of valves, insertion of pacemakers, and percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty; and, thirdly, whether other specialties
have procedures that are more important than any of these-for example,
kidney transplantation, renal dialysis, and hip replacement. In an ideal
world a better standard of care for the elderly, mentally ill, and mentally
handicapped, diagnostic methods such as computed tomography and
nuclear magnetic resonance, and preventive measures should also be
considered. I shall restrict attention here to the more costly therapeutic
technologies.
Measuring benefits
Generally, clinical trials compare rates of survival at various arbitrarily
selected times after treatment has started. For our purposes we need to
translate these comparative rates of survival into information on the change
in life expectancy, which must then be adjusted for the effects on quality of
life: some patients are willing to sacrifice a measure of life expectancy for a
better quality of life. This feature is particularly important with respect to
coronary artery bypass grafting as the procedure seems to offer a considerable
improvement in the quality of life even for patients whose life expectancy has
not changed or has even worsened.
To what extent will patients generally exchange duration of life for quality
of life? The two principal (crude) components of quality of life in this context
are physical mobility and freedom from pain (in other contexts the capacity
to perform the activities of daily living and to engage in normal social
interaction may be relevant).
Kind et al based their work on these two factors, and it is their work on the
valuation of the state of health that is used here to establish profiles ofquality
of life for the various procedures under investigation.2 Their classification of
the state of disability is as follows: I, no disability; II, slight social disability;
III, severe social disability or slight impairment of performance at work, or
both, able to do all housework except heavy tasks; IV, choice of work or
performance at work severely limited, housewives and old people able to do
only light housework but able to go out shopping; V, unable to undertake
any paid employment, unable to continue any education, old people
confined to home except for escorted outings and short walks and unable to
shop, housewives able to perform only a few single tasks; VI, confined to

B, mild; C, moderate; and D, severe. They do not claim that these measures
exhaust all the features that might be incorporated in a measurement of
quality of life.

worse than death-that is, had negative valuations-and it was only for
those states given a value of below 0-9 (below the line) that the respondents
regarded the degree of disability and distress as warranting less than 90% of
the score assigned to being fit and well. The 70 respondents included 10
doctors, all of whom appeared to have a much greater aversion to disability
and distress than the population at large; they would therefore overvalue
reductions in disability and distress compared with the rest of the
population.
Gain in quality and Emeghof life
In patien'ts with disease of one vessel and severe angina (fig 2) the
probabilities would be the same but the outcomes different as coronary
artery bypass grafting offers little potential benefit over medical manage￾ment, and if the operation proves fatal the patients will have lost the adjusted
life expectancy that medical management offers.'
The three cardiologists complained about the difficulty of establishing
these profiles with any confidence, which seems to be a serious indictment of
the nature of the evaluative work currently carried out, with measurements
of the quality of life playing a minor part, so that they were having to rely
heavily on their clinical experience. All three cardiologists offered prognoses
for the cases of severe angina, but one was unable to offer any estimates for
the cases of moderate and mild angina. The prognoses for replacement of
valves for aortic stenosis were also based on only two respondents, and the
prognoses for percutaneous coronary angioplasty and pacemakers were from
only one respondent. Table II, based on these responses, gives a schedule of
the effect on life expectancy adjusted for quality of life.

Length of life ( years )
FIG 1-Expected value of quality and length of life gained for patients with

Life expectancy and quality of life can then be joined into a single unit of
benefit, the quality adjusted life year. Unfortunately, few clinical studies
have attempted a systematic measurement of changes in quality of life in
these terms. I therefore asked three well informed cardiologists to give me
their judgments on the comparative profiles of health of various patients with
angina who had or had not undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. The
cardiologists were asked to distinguish cases of severe, moderate, and mild
angina and within each of these three subgroups to distinguish cases with left
main vessel, triple vessel, double vessel, and one vessel disease. Figures
1 and 2 show the expected quality of life profiles obtained from these data. In
67% of patients with disease of the left main vessel and severe angina there
would be considerable gains from coronary artery bypass grafting. For 30%
the operation would provide no better prognosis than medical management,
and for an unfortunate 3% the operation would prove fatal (fig 1). Thus the
expected value of coronary artery bypass grafting in this case would be 0-67
of the shaded area minus 0 03 of the unshaded area (representing the quality
oflife that would have been enjoyed had the operation not been undertaken).
*Values are for a "standard" patient: a 55 year old man with good
left ventricular function and no important concurrent conditions.
For other classes of patient gains are probably less-for example,
for women, older patients, and those with poor left ventricular
function, or other important diseases. Gains have been discounted
at 5% per annum to maintain comparability with data on cost.
Measuring costs
The resources devoted to diagnosis and treatment include costs to the
service and those falling on patients and their families. As there are few
procedures for which much information about private costs is available these
have been ignored here. The possibility that some of the rankings might be
changed had private costs been included cannot be ruled out.
Several estimates of the service costs of coronary artery bypass grafting
have been made in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. A
detailed study conducted by the Department of Health and Social Security
and the National Health Service in three NHS hospitals in 1980 suggested
that the average recurrent cost of bypass surgery, including angiography,
was about £3580 at 1983-4 prices, with an allowance of £725 for capital.
Outpatient costs were not included. Three other British studies with
apparently similar coverage of use of resources, but excluding capital,
suggested that costs ranged from £2500 to £4500.6 Most studies have
assumed that the cost of coronary artery bypass grafting is roughly the same
regardless of the number of bypasses performed. American studies have
suggested higher costs for bypass grafting ($17 500). Much of the difference
is probably explained by the fact that doctors' remuneration and the costs of
acute inpatient care are fairly high in the United States of America.

The alternative to bypass surgery is medical treatment. Some studies
assume that this costs about the same with and without bypass surgery.
Others suggest that medical treatment is considerably reduced after
coronary artery bypass grafting78: the incidence of myocardial infarction
may be reduced after grafting, resulting in further savings in medical
costs.
The incidence of repeat operations after coronary artery bypass grafting
and late operations after medical management may be similar. Weinstein
and Stason suggested that, after working out the difference in the costs of
medical care with and without operation, and the difference in the cost of
treatment of myocardial infarction, the net cost of coronary artery bypass
grafting is about 80% of the surgical cost in cases of severe angina and about
90% in cases of mild angina.7 When these ratios are applied to the DHSS's
estimates of surgical costs of bypass surgery the excess of surgical over
medical costs in the United Kingdom is about £2860 for cases of severe
angina and £3170 for cases of mild angina. This would suggest a cost of about
£3015 for moderate angina. The implication of this British and American
hybrid estimate is that the cost of medical management without operation
lies between £150 and £70 annually, depending on the severity of angina.
The cost of medical care after operation would be about £75 annually.
A report from the Mayo Clinic by Reeder et al indicates that, owing to the
high rate of restenosis, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is
only about 15% cheaper than coronary artery bypass grafting.9 If this is so in
the United Kingdom it would mean excess costs over medical management
of between £2400 and £2680.

offers better value for money in cases of severe angina and left main vessel
disease or triple vessel disease and in cases of moderate angina and left main
vessel disease than in any other circumstances.
To assess the relative value of coronary artery bypass grafting we need to
make comparisons with other forms of expensive treatment such as
replacement of valves, implantation of pacemakers, and heart transplanta￾tion. Thick et al estimated the cost of inserting a prosthetic valve (Bjork￾Shiley) as being £2000,'0 which would be £4540 at 1983-4 prices. This
includes the cost of the operation, the valve, and subsequent inpatient care
(intensive and general care) but does not include the cost of long term
anticoagulant treatment or repeat operations. An estimate of the costs of
inserting cardiac pacemakers was made by Barber, which included the costs
of implanting, reimplanting, and associated check ups based on the
experience at two hospitals in the West Midlands." These were revalued to
accommodate 1983-4 prices. Initial implantation implies a commitment to
future expenditure if the patient survives as replacement pacemakers are
required every five years (less often if batteries powered by lithium are used).
For heart transplantation Jennett quoted a figure of £15 000 (November
1982 prices) for initial costs'2; additional costs for subsequent drugs, etc,
need to be included, which I have taken to be slightly higher than those
required for kidney transplantation, amounting to an annual figure of about
£2000.
For the quality of life I obtained estimates for patients with replaced valves
and pacemakers by the same method as for those who had undergone
coronary artery bypass grafting, but for heart transplantation I used
Hellinger's review of American (mainly from Stanford) experience, which
indicated gains in life expectancy of between about two and six years.'3 As
techniques have probably improved I took a figure of 5 * 5, which I assume to
be good quality of life, which, with discounting, gave a score of 4 5. Table IV
summarises these data and shows that insertion of pacemakers (for heart
block) and replacement of valves (for aortic stenosis) are better value for
money than coronary artery bypass grafting, though insertion of a pace￾maker for the sick sinus syndrome and replacement of valves for mitral
problems compare less favourably. Heart transplantation does not seem to
be a serious contender. Table V shows the costs and relative gains in adjusted
quality of life for the treatment of end stage renal failure and hip
replacement. Interestingly, of all treatments examined so far, hip replace￾ment comes near the top of the league whereas renal dialysis fares less well
than heart transplantation.
Discussion
Before a well informed judgment can be made of whether it is in
the public interest to increase, decrease, or keep constant the
number of operations for coronary artery bypass grafting reliable
comparisons must be made with other potential users of resources.Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

Such information is not readily available, and the assumptions that I
have made are not entirely satisfactory. Clearly, further research is
needed and should be focused much more on measurement of the
quality of life and on costs (both public and private). Far too much
attention has been paid to the rate of survival, which, in the case of
coronary artery bypass grafting and many other therapeutic pro￾cedures in which the main benefit is improved quality of life, is
potentially misleading.
Resources need to be redeployed at the margin to procedures for
which the benefits to patients are high in relation to the costs, such
as the insertion of pacemakers for heart block, hip replacement,
replacement of valves for aortic stenosis, and coronary artery bypass
grafting for severe angina with left main disease and triple vessel
disease and moderate angina with left main disease. These treat￾ments should take priority over additional facilities for patients
needing kidney transplants and coronary artery bypass grafting for
mild angina with left main disease, moderate angina with triple
vessel disease or one vessel disease, and severe angina with one
vessel disease, for which the costs per quality adjusted life year
gained are higher.
I thank Martin Buxton, Philippa Hughes, Jeremy Hurst, and Peter
Mancini for their help.

Reye's syndrome surveillance scheme: third annual summary
report
The third year of the Reye's Syndrome Surveillance Scheme ended
in July 1984 and the findings are summarised below. During the
first' and second years of the surveillance scheme, which covered the
period 1 August 1981 to 31 July 1983, 30 and 52 case reports
respectively were received.
In the surveillance year 1983-4 (1 August-31 July) 90 reports of
patients meeting the case definition were received, though the
diagnosis was subsequently revised in eight of them. Sixty (67%) of
the cases were first reported by paediatricians. The sources of the
other 30 were: pathologists (five), death certificates (12), the
National Reye's Syndrome Foundation for the United Kingdom
(eight), laboratory reports (three), and one each from a parent
directly and a general practitioner. Questionnaires or case sum￾maries were obtained for 79 of the 82 cases. In the analysis below the
eight patients with revised diagnoses have been excluded.
The distribution of the 80 cases for whom this information was
provided was widespread throughout the British Isles, although, as
in previous years, the number reported from Northern Ireland was
disproportionately large. The incidence in children under 16 years
old in the British Isles overall was 0 7 per 100 000, whereas that in
the province of Northern Ireland was 4,per 100 000.
As in the previous two years' surveillance there was no clear
seasonal trend. The highest number reported in any one month was
10.
*Case definition-"Acute non-inflammatory encephalopathy of uncertain cause with
microvesicular fatty infiltration of the liver confirmed by biopsy (histology or
ultrastructure, or both) or necropsy (macroscopically large pale and fatty liver and
histological or ultrastructural confirmation); or suggested by a serum aspartate
transaminase or alanine transaminase concentration or blood ammonia concentration
greater than three times the upper limit of normal for the laboratory."
For the analysis, a case was considered "definite" Reye's syndrome if there was
histological confirmation of the clinical diagnosis; it was "possible" if there was
encephalopathy with raised transaminase concentrations with either (a) no histological
examination, or (b) some unusual clinical, biochemical, or histological feature but no
more reasonable explanation for the encephalopathy.
The ages of the patients ranged from 8 days to 13 years with a
median of 15 months, compared with 14 months in previous years
(fig 1). Forty five (55%) of the 81 patients for whom the information
was reported were boys compared with a more nearly equal sex
distribution in previous years. Twenty three (60%) of the 38 cases
below the age of 1 year were boys.
Of the 74 patients whose ethnic group was reported, 69 (93%)
were white Caucasians, two were Asians from the Indian sub￾continent, two were of mixed race, and one was Caribbean.
