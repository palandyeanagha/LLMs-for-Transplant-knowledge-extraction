Abstract
These reporting guidelines are recommended by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic
Resonance (SCMR) to provide a framework for healthcare delivery systems to disseminate cardiac
and vascular imaging findings related to the performance of cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) examinations.
Background
These reporting guidelines are recommended by the Soci￾ety for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) to
provide a framework for reporting results of cardiovascu￾lar magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations. This docu￾ment builds on previously published guidelines from
professional societies (ACC/AHA/ACR and others) [1],
and is customized here for CMR practice in particular. The
guidelines have been developed within the context of the
US health-care system, and application in other health￾care systems may vary. It is also recognized that the ulti￾mate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific pro￾cedure or reporting methodology must be made by the
physician or individuals participating within the health￾care delivery system that performs the CMR procedure. An
alternative approach that differs from these guidelines,
standing alone, does not necessarily imply that the differ￾ent approach falls below the standard of care. To the con￾trary, a conscientious practitioner may reasonably adopt
reporting elements different from those set forth in these

recommendations when, in the reasonable judgment of
the practitioner, such course of action is indicated by the
condition of the patient, limitations of available
resources, or a new advancement in knowledge or tech￾nology that may occur subsequent to the publication of
this document.
Prior to scanning, the SCMR recommends that patients be
referred for CMR scans in accordance with Appropriate￾ness Criteria developed by the SCMR, ACC, ACR, and
AHA [2]. The SCMR recommends that scans should be
performed in accordance with SCMR developed Guide￾lines for scan acquisition [3].
The SCMR recommends reporting key elements in all doc￾uments including information pertaining to a) site and
equipment information, b) patient demographics, c) indi￾cations for study, d) study performance, e) cardiovascular
imaging features of the examination, and f) concluding
statements that synthesize the study results into a compre￾hensive diagnosis that can be used for planning therapy or
determining prognosis.
The SCMR wishes to emphasize that effective communica￾tion is an essential component of any diagnostic imaging
procedures for patients with possible cardiovascular dis￾ease. Quality patient care is best achieved when study
results are conveyed in a timely fashion to those ulti￾mately responsible for treatment decisions. Accordingly,
the SCMR recommends that a delivered, finalized report
be available, where possible, within 1 business day of per￾formance of the scan, but appropriate to the urgency of
the examination.
The following document serves as a guide to identify a)
recommended and optional components of the report, b)
the principles used to generate a final report, and c) sug￾gested communications that may occur other than the
final report. A final written interpretation or report shall
be generated and archived following any CMR examina￾tion, procedure, or officially requested consultation to
review images regardless of the setting where the CMR
scan was performed (hospital, imaging center, physician
office, mobile unit, etc.). Within the document, all recom￾mended and optional components are in bold, and sum￾marized in Additional files 1 and 2.
Components of the report

6) Non-imaging findings associated with the examination
(5 recommended elements)
a) In those studies requiring 12-lead electrocardiogram,
its interpretation should be provided. This includes the
presence of Q-waves, ST segment or T-wave abnormalities,
or other rhythm disturbances.
b) For studies evaluating hemodynamically important
conditions (i.e., valvular heart disease, intracardiac shunt￾ing, cardiac output, etc.), heart rates and rhythm, and
systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be provided
during the CMR acquisition. For tests incorporating stress
testing, the heart rates and rhythm, oxygen saturation,
systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and the predictive
heart rate response for age should all be recorded during
the following points in time:
• Before study
• At each level of stress
• In recovery
c) For studies utilizing cardiac active agents (i.e., stress
testing), the agent, quantity, duration, and route of
administration of the agents and associated medica￾tions should be provided.
d) For studies utilizing contrast agents, the type (i.e. par￾amagnetic), name, route, site, and speed of administra￾tion should be provided.
e) For studies utilizing sedation, general anesthesia, or
supported ventilatory or cardiac (hemodynamic or electri￾cal) assistance, the amount, type, route and measures of
administration of these agents or support should be
documented. Also, patients' cardiovascular and pulmo￾nary responses (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory
rate, and oxygen saturation) should be recorded accord￾ingly to local regulations. The reason for administration
required of the agent should be provided.
7. Specific Conditions Assessed with CMR
a) Magnetic resonance arteriography
1. Aorta
Dimensions including (4 recommended, 1 optional):
a. Aortic annulus (recommended)
b. Sinuses of Valsalva (recommended)
c. Sinotubular junction (recommended)
d. Ascending and descending diameters at the level of
the pulmonary artery (recommended)
e. Comment regarding whether the aorta is right or left￾sided may be provided (optional).
Findings when present (7 recommended, 1 optional):
a. Comment on sinotubular effacement (recommended)
b. Comment on tortuosity (recommended)
c. Aortic atherosclerosis (recommended): description of
location, mobility and extent, estimate %-stenosis when
advanced
d. Aortic aneurysm (recommended): size (AP × LR × CC),

aorta, relation to branch vessels, presence of mural
thrombus, visceral compressive effects (effacement
expansion of the aorta against surrounding structures),
post-contrast appearance (if these sequence were

(page number not for citation purposes)
acquired), presence of periaortic, mediastinal, pericar￾dial, or pleural fluid.
e. Aortic dissection (recommended): dissection classifi￾cation (either DeBakey or Stanford), presence of intimal
flap, location of tear or areas of communication (if pos￾sible), description of the size and extent of the true and
false lumens, presence of murmal thrombus or blood in
false lumen, branch vessel involvement, presence of
periaortic, mediastinal, pericardial, or pleural fluid,
i. Intramural hematoma (IH): in cases of IH and pene￾trating aortic ulcer, the CMR practitioner should describe
carefully the morphologic findings in much the same way
as an aortic dissection paying careful attention to select
wording to convey a diagnosis of limited ulceration or dis￾section.
ii. Post-operative appearance: this should be described in
accordance with (a-e) above noting additional graft inser￾tion points and dimensions.
f. Inflammatory diseases of the aorta (recommended):
aortic wall thickness, multispectral appearance on dif￾ferent pulse sequences, contrast enhancement pattern,
branch vessel involvement, presence of periaortic, pleu￾ral, or pericardial fluid
g. Congenital disease involving the aorta and ventricu￾loarterial connections: see recommended congenital
report below.
h. Aortic flow (optional): On CMR scans of the aorta in
which PC-MR measures are obtained, the direction and
magnitude of flow should be provided.
2. Peripheral arterial disease (2 recommended, 1
optional):
a) Vessel location and orientation. Descriptions of each
territory are required when the study is ordered to exam￾ine the respective site (recommended). When severe sten￾oses or vessel occlusions are identified, common
collateral pathways should be described.
• Arch vessels
• Carotid bifurcation
• Celiac trunk
• Proximal SMA
• Renal arteries and their accessory vessels
• Common and external iliac
• Femoral, brachial or other more peripheral arteries.
b) Quantitation of luminal narrowings or stenoses (rec￾ommended)
SCMR recommends that the CMR practitioner avoid
descriptive terms such as "mild" or "moderate" stenosis,
but rather adopt a semi-quantitative method that scores
the severity of luminal occlusion. Accordingly, stenosis
severity should be reported in 25% increments (i.e.,
<25%, 26% – 50%, 51% – 75%, and >75%) or, in cases
with high spatial resolution, finer increments of 10% may
be employed. Descriptive terms may convey the wrong
impression to the clinical importance of occlusive disease
(e.g. a series of "moderate" stenoses in the diabetic patient
with poor wound healing of the lower extremity may be
clinically significant)
c) Optional functional measures of the vascular system
may also be reported, including:
i.) flow measurements in the forms of milliliters or liters
per minute, and
ii.) measures of vascular stiffness: aortic distensibility, or
pulse wave velocity.
When functional measures are provided it is recom￾mended that the vascular territories be specified and val￾ues provided at the specific location of acquisition.
b) Cardiac Size and Function
1) The reporting of right ventricular (RV) and left and
right atrial chamber sizes and volumes are optional.
Reporting of left ventricular (LV) volumes is recom￾mended when multi-slice cine short axes data are acquired
from the mitral annulus to the cardiac apex. When
reported, SCMR suggests that right-sided chambers meas￾urements and the angulation from which the diameters or
dimensions are acquired should be reported. For the left￾sided cardiac chambers, the 3-chamber long axis view
should be used for identifying LV dimensions. The SCMR
encourages quantitative measures reported on their
forms; however, determination of normal, enlarged,
small, or not reported may be substituted.
2) Although not required, the SCMR encourages the
reporting of LV end diastolic wall thicknesses acquired
in the 3-chamber view of the left ventricle at the mitral
leaflet tips; it is suggested that the end diastolic thickness
be acquired at the septum and inferior lateral or posterior
wall.

(page number not for citation purposes)
3) When assessing the right ventricle, the free wall end
diastolic thickness (in the middle atrium portion of the
wall) may be reported.
4) For those studies targeting the heart, the SCMR recom￾mends the reporting of LV ejection fraction, and regional
wall motion abnormalities. The method of acquisition
should be reported, including:
▪ Visual estimation
▪ Area-length formula
▪ Multi-slice disk summation technique
Values should be reported as absolute values and indexed
for body surface area.
• Measurements derived from these values (i.e., cardiac
output) should be expressed as absolute as well as indexed
values and the reference heart rates used for these calcula￾tions should be provided in the report.
• Regional wall motion should be described as qualita￾tively or quantitatively assessed in the 17-segment model
adopted by the ACC/AHA guidelines2 for noninvasive
testing (Figure 1). Qualitative assessments should follow
the following nomenclature in which each segment is
identified as:
▪ hyperkinetic
▪ normokinetic
▪ hypokinetic
▪ akinetic
▪ dyskinetic
▪ tardykinetic
▪ paradoxical
▪ not assessed
• If the respective site seeks to report quantitative meas￾ures, such as thickening or strain, these should be per￾formed and reported according to previously published
techniques.
c) Cardiovascular stress testing
As described in the non-imaging findings component of
the reported list above, parameters such as vital signs,
medications, and contrast agent administration should be
reported. The SCMR recommends the reporting of LV
myocardial information in the format of a 17-segment
model through the use of a chart, table, or bipolar maps
(so called "Bullseye" plot) [4].
1. Wall motion stress:
Wall function should be designated as qualitative (wall
motion) or quantitative (referenced measure such as %
wall thickening, or strain) during testing. In addition, wall
motion score index (the sum of the wall motion scores
divided by the number of segments scored) should be
reported at each level of stress. Inducible ischemia or con￾tractile reserve should be identified in each study accord￾ing to previously published referenced methods.
Identification should be made of when global LV function
does not improve or worsens during stress.
2. Gadolinium, 1st pass myocardial perfusion:
Existing literature regarding the prognostic significance of
qualitative perfusion defects is unavailable at this time;
nevertheless, SCMR suggests that perfusion in each of the
17 segments (Figure 1) be defined according to the trans￾murality, and persistence of the defect. The committee
recommends that stress induced (vasodilator or ino￾tropic) perfusion defects be compared with co-registered
rest perfusion or late enhancement segments in order to
identify ischemic, infarcted, or non-ischemic areas. The
SCMR also recognizes that observed defects may be char￾acterized as artifacts. These should be described.
3. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE):
17-segment model of the LV ACC/AHA for reporting abnormalities of wall motion, per- fusion or injury Figure 1 myocardium developed by the 
17-segment model of the LV myocardium developed 
by the ACC/AHA for reporting abnormalities of wall 
motion, perfusion or injury.
1. basal anterior 7. mid-anterior 13. apical anterior
2. basal anteroseptal 8. mid-anteroseptal 14. apical septal
3. basel inferoseptal 9. mid-inferoseptal 15. apical inferior
4. basel inferior 10. mid-inferior 16. lateral
5. basel inferolateral 11. mid-inferolateral 17. apex
6. basel anterolateral 12. mid-anterolateral

Page 6 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)
The amount of intense signal >2 SD above the average of
normal myocardium should be reported for the area
within each segment. Overall, LGE should be described as
subepicardial, intramural, subendocardial, or transmural.
Patchy or linear streaks of LGE should be identified. The
transmural extent of the LGE should be defined as 0, ≤
25%, 26% to ≤ 50%, 51% to ≤ 75%, and 76% to 100%. In
addition, the total amount of infarcted tissue (volume or
grams) relative to the total myocardial volume or mass (g)
may be reported. It is not recommended, but measures of
LV end-diastolic wall thickness for the 17 myocardial seg￾ments may also be reported. When clinically appropriate,
those providing an interpretation should indicate whether
the pattern of LGE is consistent with ischemic heart dis￾ease, myocarditis, etc.
4. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) :
If MVO is observed during LGE, its location and presence
within the 17 myocardial segments should be provided.
Integrative stress imaging:
It is recognized by the SCMR that the procedures men￾tioned above can be performed in a single setting and thus
must be integrated to arrive at a diagnosis. The committee
recommends reporting data for all 17 myocardial seg￾ments in all modalities (Figure below). Based on previ￾ously published techniques, segments should be
identified as ischemic, infarcted, mixed ischemia/infarc￾tion, or normal. It is recommended that all information
for baseline function be reported in patients referred for
stress testing or evaluation of acute or chronic ischemic
syndromes.
For these clinical conditions, the following items are rec￾ommended for reporting by the SCMR.
• LV volumes (EDV, ESV, SV, EF) with and without index￾ing to body surface area.
• Presence and extent of (T2) signal intensity
• Presence and extent of irreversible injury (LGE)
• Presence of pericardial effusion
• In the case of iron overload: T2* in ms may be reported
• Optional: early enhancement ratio† or the % injury
related to LV mass
†: see Lake Louise Criteria, Consensus Group on CMR in
Myocarditis
e. Coronary Arterial Segments
It is recommended that when examining the course of
anomalous coronary arteries, the origin and course of the
coronary artery segments be reported, as well as the
length of the segments visualized. If anomalous artery is
intramural, it should be noted. If a study is performed for
the purpose of identifying coronary artery or bypass graft
anatomy, the patency of these conduits should be indi￾cated.
f. Valvular Heart Disease
The following lists of items should be reported for the car￾diac valves.
Qualitative parameters:
• morphology of each component of the valve complex
(e.g. leaflets, annulus, chordae)
• presence of any insufficiency or reduced valvular excur￾sion
When quantitative flow measurements are acquired:
• the velocity encoding Venc setting;
• the peak velocity, a single value when recorded across
semilunar valves or a vessel in cross-section, or both early
(E) and late (A) peak velocities for atrioventricular valves;
• the forward stroke volume and peak and mean transval￾vular gradients;
• the regurgitant volume and fraction;
• the heart rate during acquisition;
• the method and determination of valve area (by plan￾imetry or the continuity equation);
• the measurement of ventricular dimensions and vol￾umes as described in III-B.
g. Arrhythmogenic RV Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
1) It is recommended that each report identify major and
minor criteria associated with ARVC. This should include
a statement regarding:
a) Global right ventricular performance (RVEF);
b) RV dilation;

(page number not for citation purposes)
c) Location of Regional RV wall motion abnormalities
(infundibulum, body or apex of right ventricle).
When acquired:
a) Fatty infiltration of the right ventricle, and
b) Occurrence of fibrosis by LGE should be provided.
h. Cardiac and paracardiac masses (including pericar￾dium)

9. Noncardiovascular Findings
It is recognized that there may be findings unrelated to the
cardiovascular system identified during CMR imaging
procedures. Such findings should be reported in accord￾ance with local standards. However, SCMR recognizes
that the contrast, resolution and field of view of a CMR
study are optimized for the cardiovascular system rather
than to assess for abnormalities outside of the cardiovas￾cular system.
10. Summary and Conclusions
SCMR recommends that each report conclude with appro￾priate statements that relate the study indications to the
imaging acquisition and findings associated with per￾formance of the study. SCMR recommends that these
statements provide referring physicians with conclusions
that allow the prescription of therapy based on the study
findings. SCMR recommends that the conclusion of the
report provide the written or electronic signature of the
individual accomplishing the report along with the time
and date of the signature. SCMR considers it optional to
provide the National Provider Identifier for the physician
signing the report.
Principles of disseminating the final report
1) The final signed report is considered to be the definitive
means of communicating to the referring physician or
other relevant health care provider. Other methods of
rapid communication are encouraged in certain situa￾tions, such as critical findings, unexpected abnormal find￾ings, or findings that may immediately alter the patient's
course of treatment.
2) The report should be reviewed to minimize interpre￾tive, descriptive, or transcription errors prior transmitting
the final results.
3) The final report should be completed in accordance
with governmental or health care facility medical records
regulations.
4) The signed written report should be immediately trans￾mitted to the referring physician or health care provider
who is treating the patient once it has been finalized and
in accordance with appropriate governmental require￾ments.
5) When feasible, a copy of relevant key images should
accompany the final report.
6) A copy of the final report should be archived at the
imaging facility as part of the patient's medical record and
be retrievable for future reference. Retention and distribu￾tion of these records should be in accordance with govern￾mental regulations and facility policies.
Communications other than the final report
SCMR strongly encourages the rapid dissemination of a
finalized report. It is recognized however, that preliminary
reports may be necessary in certain situations. Preliminary
reports should be identified as such; however, it is recog￾nized by SCMR that their accuracy may be compromised.
If a change is made by a disseminated preliminary discrep￾ant from the final interpretation, then written documen￾tation and communication to all treating or referring
physicians is indicated.
It is recommended that any methods of such communica￾tions be included in the final report such that documenta￾tion is complete.
Self-referred and Third Party Referred Patients
The SCMR recognizes that some individuals may seek
imaging studies as part of a self-referral or referred by a
third party, such as an insurer or an employer.
Self-referred patients
Imagers should recognize that performing imaging stud￾ies on self-referred patients establishes a doctor patient
relationship that includes responsibility for communicat￾ing the results of imaging studies directly to the patient
and arranging for appropriate followup.
Third Party Referred Patients
Patients may be referred for imaging studies by insurance
companies, employers, research studies, other benefit
programs, or in some instances, attorneys. In such cases,
the reports of these studies are frequently communicated
through their requesting entity to a clinician or directly to
the third party designated clinician. The results of these
examinations are then communicated to the patient
directly. Regardless of the source of the referral, the diag￾nostic imager has an ethical responsibility to insure com￾munication of unexpected or serious findings to the
patients. It is suggested that each imaging organization
that desires to scan and generate reports on self referred
patients develop communication policies within their
centers to address evolving issues in this arena.
