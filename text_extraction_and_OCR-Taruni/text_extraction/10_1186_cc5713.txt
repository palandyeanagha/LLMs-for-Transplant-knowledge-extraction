Abstract
Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder for
which currently there is no accepted definition. Having a uniform
standard for diagnosing and classifying AKI would enhance our
ability to manage these patients. Future clinical and translational
research in AKI will require collaborative networks of
investigators drawn from various disciplines, dissemination of
information via multidisciplinary joint conferences and
publications, and improved translation of knowledge from pre￾clinical research. We describe an initiative to develop uniform
standards for defining and classifying AKI and to establish a
forum for multidisciplinary interaction to improve care for
patients with or at risk for AKI.
Methods Members representing key societies in critical care
and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and
pediatric AKI participated in a two day conference in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in September 2005 and were
assigned to one of three workgroups. Each group's discussions
formed the basis for draft recommendations that were later
refined and improved during discussion with the larger group.
Dissenting opinions were also noted. The final draft
recommendations were circulated to all participants and
subsequently agreed upon as the consensus recommendations
for this report. Participating societies endorsed the
recommendations and agreed to help disseminate the results.
Results The term AKI is proposed to represent the entire
spectrum of acute renal failure. Diagnostic criteria for AKI are
proposed based on acute alterations in serum creatinine or urine
output. A staging system for AKI which reflects quantitative
changes in serum creatinine and urine output has been
developed.
Conclusion We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary
collaborative network focused on AKI. We have proposed
uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI which will
need to be validated in future studies. The Acute Kidney Injury
Network offers a mechanism for proceeding with efforts to
improve patient outcomes.

Introduction
Acute renal failure (ARF) is a complex disorder that occurs in
a variety of settings with clinical manifestations ranging from a
minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. It
is often under-recognized and is associated with severe con￾sequences [1-4]. Recent epidemiological studies demon￾strate the wide variation in etiologies and risk factors [1,5-7],
describe the increased mortality associated with this disease
(particularly when dialysis is required) [1,4,6,8,9], and suggest
a relationship to the subsequent development of chronic kid￾ney disease (CKD) and progression to dialysis dependency
[1,4,8,10-12]. Emerging evidence suggests that even minor
changes in serum creatinine are associated with increased in￾patient mortality [13-20]. ARF has been the focus of extensive
clinical and basic research efforts over the last decades. The
lack of a universally recognized definition of ARF has posed a
significant limitation. Despite the significant progress made in
understanding the biology and mechanism of ARF in animal
models, translation of this knowledge into improved manage￾ment and outcomes for patients has been limited.
During the last five years, several groups have recognized
these limitations and have worked to identify the knowledge
gaps and define the necessary steps to correct these deficien￾cies. These efforts have included consensus conferences and
publications from the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI)
group [19,21-25], the American Society of Nephrology (ASN)
ARF Advisory group [26], the International Society of Nephrol￾ogy (ISN), and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and
KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes)
groups [27]. Additionally, the critical care societies have devel￾oped formal intersociety collaborations such as the Interna￾tional Consensus Conferences in Critical Care [28].
Recognizing that future clinical and translational research in
ARF will require multidisciplinary collaborative networks, the
ADQI group and representatives from three nephrology socie￾ties (ASN, ISN, and NKF) and the European Society of Inten￾sive Care Medicine met in Vicenza, Italy, in September 2004.
They proposed the term acute kidney injury (AKI) to reflect the
entire spectrum of ARF, recognizing that an acute decline in
kidney function is often secondary to an injury that causes
functional or structural changes in the kidneys. The group
established the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) as an
independent collaborative network comprised of experts
selected by the participating societies to represent both their
area of expertise and their sponsoring organization. AKIN is
intended to facilitate international, interdisciplinary, and inter￾societal collaborations to ensure progress in the field of AKI
and obtain the best outcomes for patients with or at risk for
AKI.
This report describes an interim definition and staging system
for AKI and a plan for further activities of the collaborative net￾work which were developed at the first AKIN conference held
in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in September 2005.
Materials and methods
Representatives of the major critical care and nephrology soci￾eties and associations and invited content experts were
assigned to workgroups to consider three topics: (a) the
development of uniform standards for definition and classifica￾tion of AKI, (b) joint conference topics, and (c) the interdisci￾plinary collaborative research network. Each workgroup had
an assigned chair and co-chair to facilitate the discussion and
develop summary recommendations of the workgroup. The
draft recommendations were then refined and improved during
discussion with the larger group. Key points and issues were
noted and then discussed a second time if no resolution was
reached initially. When a majority view was not evident or
when the area was felt to be of extreme importance, votes
were tallied. Dissenting opinions were also noted. The final
recommendations were circulated to all participants and sub￾sequently agreed upon as the consensus recommendations
for this report. After an iterative process of revisions, the final
manuscript was presented to each of the respective societies
for endorsement. Societies were asked to facilitate dissemina￾tion of the findings to their membership through presentations
in society conferences and publication of summary reports in
society journals, Web sites, and other forms of
communication.
Results
1. Proposal for uniform standards for definition and 
classification of AKI
Definition and diagnostic criteria of AKI
For any condition, the clinician needs to know whether the dis￾ease is present and, if so, where and when the patient falls in
the natural history of the disease. The former facilitates recog￾nition whereas the latter defines time points for intervention.
Unfortunately, there has been no uniformly accepted definition
of AKI. Studies describe ARF or AKI based on serum creati￾nine changes, absolute levels of serum creatinine, changes in
blood urea nitrogen or urine output, or the need for dialysis
[1,11,20,29-36]. The wide variation in definitions has made it
difficult to compare information across studies and popula￾tions [37].
Diagnostic criteria
Recognition of AKI requires the delineation of easily measured
criteria that can be widely applied. Serum creatinine levels and
changes in urine output are the most commonly applied meas￾ures of renal function; however, they are each influenced by
factors other than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and do
not provide any information about the nature or site of kidney
injury. The proposed diagnostic criteria (Table 1) were based
on consideration of the following concepts:
1. The definition needs to be broad enough to accommodate
variations in clinical presentation over age groups, locations,
and clinical situations.

2. Sensitive and specific markers for kidney injury are not cur￾rently available in clinical practice. Several groups are working
on developing and validating biomarkers of kidney injury and
GFR which may be used in the future for diagnosis and
prognosis.
3. There is accumulating evidence that small increments in
serum creatinine are associated, in a variety of settings, with
adverse outcomes [13-20] that are manifest in short-term mor￾bidity and mortality and in longer-term outcomes, including 1-
year mortality [15-17]. Current clinical practice does not focus
much attention on small increments in serum creatinine, which
are often attributed to lab variations. However, the coefficient
of variation of serum creatinine with modern analyzers is rela￾tively small and therefore increments of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l)
are unlikely to be due to assay variation [38]. Changes in vol￾ume status can influence serum creatinine levels [39].
Because the amount of fluid resuscitation depends on the
underlying clinical situation [40], the group agreed that appli￾cation of the diagnostic criteria would be used only after an
optimal state of hydration had been achieved.
4. A time constraint of 48 hours for diagnosis was selected
based on the evidence that adverse outcomes with small
changes in creatinine were observed when the creatinine ele￾vation occurred within 24 to 48 hours [15,16] and to ensure
that the process was acute and representative of events within
a clinically relevant time period. In the two aforementioned
studies, there was no distinction of underlying CKD or de novo
AKI. However, in the study by Chertow and colleagues [13],
the odds ratio for mortality with a change in creatinine of 0.3
mg/dl (25 μmol/l) was 4.1 (confidence interval 3.1 to 5.5)
adjusting for CKD. There is no requirement to wait 48 hours to
diagnose AKI or initiate appropriate measures to treat AKI.
Instead, the time period is designed to eliminate situations in
which the increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 is very slow and
thus is not 'acute.'
5. It was recognized that AKI is often superimposed on pre￾existing CKD. Further validation will be required to determine
whether the criterion of a creatinine elevation of 0.3 mg/dl (25
μmol/l) is applicable to these patients (that is, whether a cre￾atinine increase of more than 0.3 mg/dl from an elevated base￾line represents AKI and has the same risks as a creatinine
increase from a normal baseline).
6. The need for including urine output as a diagnostic criterion
is based on the knowledge of critically ill patients in whom this
parameter often heralds renal dysfunction before serum creat￾inine increases.
A minority of group members, both intensivists and nephrolo￾gists, felt that a urine output reduction of less than 0.5 ml/kg
per hour over the span of six hours was not specific enough to
lead confidently to the designation of AKI. It was recognized
that the hydration state, use of diuretics, and presence of
obstruction could influence the urine volume, hence the need
to consider the clinical context. Additionally, accurate meas￾urements of urine output may not be easily available in all
cases, particularly in patients in non-intensive care unit set￾tings. Despite these limitations, it was felt that the use of
changes in urine offers a sensitive and easily discernible
means of identifying patients, but its value as an independent
criterion for diagnosis of AKI will need to be validated.
The proposed diagnostic criteria for AKI are designed to facil￾itate acquisition of new knowledge and validate the emerging
concept that small alterations in kidney function may contrib￾ute to adverse outcomes. The goal of adopting these explicit
diagnostic criteria is to increase the clinical awareness and
diagnosis of AKI. It is recognized that there may be an increase
in false-positives, so that some patients labeled with AKI will
not have the condition. There was consensus that adopting
the more inclusive criteria is preferable to the current situation,
in which the condition is under-recognized and many people
are identified late in the course of their illness and potentially
miss the opportunity for prevention or application of strategies
to minimize further kidney damage.
Staging/classification
The goal of a staging system is to classify the course of a dis￾ease in a reproducible manner that supports accurate identifi￾cation and prognostication and informs diagnostic or
therapeutic interventions. The group recognized that a number
of systems for staging and classifying AKI are currently in use
or have been proposed [41]. The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure,
Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury
An abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function currently defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0.3 
mg/dl (≥ 26.4 μmol/l), a percentage increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 50% (1.5-fold from baseline), or a reduction in urine 
output (documented oliguria of less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than six hours).
The above criteria include both an absolute and a percentage change in creatinine to accommodate variations related to age, gender, and body 
mass index and to reduce the need for a baseline creatinine but do require at least two creatinine values within 48 hours. The urine output criterion 
was included based on the predictive importance of this measure but with the awareness that urine outputs may not be measured routinely in non￾intensive care unit settings. It is assumed that the diagnosis based on the urine output criterion alone will require exclusion of urinary tract 
obstructions that reduce urine output or of other easily reversible causes of reduced urine output. The above criteria should be used in the context 
of the clinical presentation and following adequate fluid resuscitation when applicable. Note: Many acute kidney diseases exist, and some (but not 
all) of them may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Because diagnostic criteria are not documented, some cases of AKI may not be diagnosed. 
Furthermore, AKI may be superimposed on or lead to chronic kidney disease.

Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria [25] proposed by
the ADQI group were developed by an interdisciplinary, inter￾national consensus process and are now being validated by
different groups worldwide [36,37]. However, according to
data that have emerged since then, smaller changes in serum
creatinine than those considered in the RIFLE criteria might be
associated with adverse outcomes [13-18]. Additionally, given
the consensus definition for AKI (Table 1), RIFLE criteria have
been modified so that patients meeting the definition for AKI
could be staged (Table 2). The proposed staging system
retains the emphasis on changes in serum creatinine and urine
output but includes the following principles:
1. Although diagnosis of AKI is based on changes over the
course of 48 hours, staging occurs over a slightly longer time
frame. One week was proposed by the ADQI group in the orig￾inal RIFLE criteria [25].
2. There was a conscious decision not to include the therapy
for AKI (that is, renal replacement therapy [RRT]) as a distinct
stage because this constitutes an outcome of AKI.
3. The new staging system maps to the RIFLE stages as
follows:
3a. RIFLE 'Risk' category should have the same criteria as for
Table 2
Classification/staging system for acute kidney injurya
Stage Serum creatinine criteria Urine output criteria
1 Increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.4 μmol/l) or 
increase to more than or equal to 150% to 200% (1.5- to 2-fold) from baseline
Less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than 6 hours
2b Increase in serum creatinine to more than 200% to 300% (> 2- to 3-fold) from 
baseline
Less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than 12 
hours
3c Increase in serum creatinine to more than 300% (> 3-fold) from baseline (or serum 
creatinine of more than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl [≥ 354 μmol/l] with an acute increase 
of at least 0.5 mg/dl [44 μmol/l])
Less than 0.3 ml/kg per hour for 24 hours or anuria 
for 12 hours
aModified from RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria [26]. The staging system proposed is a highly sensitive 
interim staging system and is based on recent data indicating that a small change in serum creatinine influences outcome. Only one criterion 
(creatinine or urine output) has to be fulfilled to qualify for a stage. b200% to 300% increase = 2- to 3-fold increase. cGiven wide variation in 
indications and timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT), individuals who receive RRT are considered to have met the criteria for 
stage 3 irrespective of the stage they are in at the time of RRT.

the diagnosis of stage 1 AKI.
3b. Those who are classified as having 'Injury' and 'Failure' cat￾egories map to stages 2 and 3 of AKI.
3c. The 'Loss' and 'End-stage kidney disease' categories were
removed from the staging system and remain outcomes.
3d. Given the variability inherent in commencing RRT and due
to variability in resources in different populations and coun￾tries, patients receiving RRT are to be included in stage 3
(analogous to stage 5 CKD, GFR of less than 15, or dialysis).
2. Future joint conference topics and key collaborative 
research questions
There is a need to ensure that collaborative and integrated
joint conferences are planned to facilitate the dissemination of
knowledge, clarify clinical practice, and enhance research.
Many organizations are currently in the process of planning
meetings on ARF/AKI. These meeting take various forms:
knowledge exchange/scientific meetings, consensus contro￾versies, and research initiatives. The group described five key
topics that should be addressed by any of the professional
communities involved in the care of patients with AKI. The par￾ticular venue and the process and products of these confer￾ences were not discussed in detail. An overview of the topics
and issues that would be well served by a multidisciplinary
consensus or controversies conference is presented in Table
3. These topics reflect important areas in which there is a need
for ongoing research to develop evidence. A key step for
future conferences will be to determine which research ques￾tions are most important and pressing to advance the field and
improve outcomes from AKI.
3. Need for an international collaborative network
AKI is a global problem with varying etiologies and manifesta￾tions, but the outcomes are similar [1-4,6]. Given the wide glo￾bal variation in the natural history and management of AKI, it is
essential that mechanisms for sharing information and for col￾laboration among centers be developed. It was felt that the
establishment of an international collaborative research effort
for AKI would contribute to international research and educa￾tion about AKI. The group proposed four major topics that
would need to be addressed by this initiative (Table 4).
Conclusion
AKI is a complex disorder for which there is no currently
accepted uniform definition. Having a standard for diagnosing
and classifying AKI would enhance our ability to improve the
management of these patients. We have described the forma￾tion of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI
and have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and clas￾sifying AKI. The proposed standards will need to be validated
in future studies. These standards build upon existing knowl￾Table 4

example, RIFLE) to transition to the new system without loss

endorsed by the participating societies, which represent the
majority of the critical care and nephrology societies world￾wide and which have been asked to disseminate the results via
presentations at the national and regional society conferences
and through publication of summary reports in society journals
(see Table 5 for society endorsement details). We believe that
these recommendations provide a stepping stone to standard￾Table 5

izing the care of patients with AKI and will greatly enhance our
ability to design prospective studies to evaluate potential pre￾vention and treatment strategies. One of the limitations of con￾sensus recommendations is that they are often not adopted.
We anticipate that the broad support and commitment
obtained through society involvement will significantly
enhance the ability to disseminate the results to the worldwide
community and to address this limitation. Future clinical and
translational research in AKI will require the development of
collaborative networks of investigators drawn from various dis￾ciplines to facilitate the acquisition of evidence through well￾designed and well-conducted clinical trials, dissemination of
information via multidisciplinary joint conferences and publica￾tions, and improvement of the translation of knowledge from
pre-clinical research. We anticipate that the AKIN will provide
an effective mechanism for facilitating efforts to improve
patient outcomes.

Key messages
• AKI is a complex disorder, and we have proposed uni￾form standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI on 
the basis of existing systems (that is, RIFLE). These pro￾posals will require validation.
• Our recommendations have been endorsed by partici￾pating societies that represent the majority of critical 
care and nephrology societies worldwide.
• These recommendations provide a stepping stone to 
standardizing the care of patients with AKI and will 
greatly enhance our ability to design prospective stud￾ies to evaluate potential prevention and treatment 
strategies.
• Future clinical and translational research in AKI will 
require the development of collaborative networks. The 
AKIN was formed to provide an effective mechanism for 
facilitating such efforts.
