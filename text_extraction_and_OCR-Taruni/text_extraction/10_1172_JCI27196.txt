Platelets in inflammation and atherogenesis

Platelets represent an important linkage between inflammation, thrombosis, and atherogenesis. Inflammation
is characterized by interactions among platelets, leukocytes, and ECs. These interactions trigger autocrine and
paracrine activation processes that lead to leukocyte recruitment into the vascular wall. Platelet-induced chronic
inflammatory processes at the vascular wall result in development of atherosclerotic lesions and atherothrom￾bosis. This Review highlights the molecular machinery and inflammatory pathways used by platelets to initiate
and accelerate atherothrombosis.
Platelet interaction with endothelium
At the site of vascular lesions, ECM proteins such as vWF and col￾lagen are exposed to the blood. Platelet adhesion to the exposed
matrix is considered to be the initial step in thrombus formation.
Platelets adhere to vWF via the membrane adhesion receptor gly￾coprotein Ib/IX/V (GPIb/IX/V) (1) and to collagen via GPVI (2–4).
Thisresultsin platelet activation and transformation of the integ￾rin receptors αIIbβ3 (GPIIb/IIIa, fibrinogen receptor) (5, 6) and α2β1
(collagen receptor) (4, 7), which firmly bind to the respective ECM
components. Subsequently, platelets spread and form a surface
for the recruitment of additional platelets via fibrinogen bridges
between 2 αIIbβ3 receptors.
In vitro studies with human ECs. In recent years, however, it has
become increasingly evident that endothelial denudation is not
an absolute prerequisite to allow platelet attachment to the
arterial wall. The intact, nonactivated endothelium normally
prevents platelet adhesion to the ECM. The adhesion receptors
involved in platelet attachment to the subendothelial matrix,
e.g., following rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, have been
well defined during the past decade; however, the molecular
determinantsthat promote the interaction between platelets and
endothelium are incompletely understood. Whereas endotheli￾um normally controls platelet reactivity through inhibitory and
modulating mechanisms involving COX-2, PGI2, or prostanoid
synthetic systems, inflamed ECs develop properties that render
them adhesive for platelets. In vitro studies showed that plate￾lets adhere to the intact but activated human EC monolayer
(8–10). Platelet adhesion to human umbilical vein ECs(HUVECs)
is mediated by a GPIIb/IIIa–dependent bridging mechanism
involving platelet-bound fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vWF
(10). In HUVECs infected with herpes virus or stimulated with
IL-1, platelet adhesion was effectively inhibited by antibodies
to vWF or αIIbβ3 integrin, respectively (9, 11, 12). Furthermore,
the involvement of the EC receptors ICAM-1, αvβ3 integrin, and
GPIb in the binding of activated platelets to HUVECs has been
described in vitro (10).
In vivo studies of mouse models. Most in vitro studies have evalu￾ated platelet-endothelium adhesion to human ECs under static
conditions with limited attention to the dynamic situation in
vivo. Studies using intravital microscopy, however, confirmed
that platelet-endothelium adhesion occurs even under high shear
stressin vivo (13–19). The results of these studies provide evidence
that, similar to interaction with extracellular matrix proteins at
the site of vascular lesions, adhesion of platelets to the intact
endothelium is coordinated in a multistep process that involves
platelet tethering, followed by rolling and subsequent firm adhe￾sion to the vascular wall (Figure 1). These processes involve
interactions involving at least 2 types of receptors, selectins and
integrins, which induce receptor-specific activation signals in
both platelets and the respective adhesive cell type.
The initial loose contact between circulating platelets and vas￾cular endothelium (“platelet rolling”) is mediated by selectins,
present on both ECs and platelets (20). P-selectin (CD62P) is rap￾idly expressed on the endothelial surface in response to inflam￾matory stimuli by translocating from membranes of storage
granules (Weibel-Palade bodies) to the plasma membrane within
seconds. Endothelial P-selectin has been demonstrated to medi￾ate platelet rolling in both arterioles and venules in acute inflam￾matory processes (14, 15). E-selectin, which is also expressed
on inflamed ECs, allows a loose contact between platelets and
endothelium in vivo (15). In line with the concept of endothelial
inflammation as a trigger for platelet accumulation, the process
of platelet rolling does not require previous platelet activation,
since platelets from mice lacking P- and/or E-selectin roll as effi￾ciently as wild-type platelets (17).
So far, few studies have addressed the exact nature of the ligands
expressed on platelets that bind to endothelial P-selectin. One
candidate that has been identified as a potential counterreceptor
for platelet P-selectin isthe leucine-rich GPIb/IX/V, also known as
the vWF receptor complex. Romo et al. (21) have recently demon￾strated that cells expressing P-selectin roll on immobilized GPIbα.
Platelets rolling on activated endothelium can be inhibited by
antibodies against both P-selectin and GPIbα, indicating that the
vWF receptor mediates platelet adhesion to both the subendo￾thelial matrix and the intact endothelium (21). Further, PSGL-1,
a glycoprotein that avidly associates with P-selectin, is pres￾ent on platelets and mediates platelet rolling to the endothelial
monolayer under high shear rates (22, 23).
The interaction between P-selectin and PSGL-1 or GPIb/IX/V,
however, is rapidly reversible and insufficient for stable adhesion.
Rapid conversion to stable adhesion requires additional contacts
between the platelet and the endothelium. Integrins are recog￾nized asthe major class ofsurface receptor mediating stable adhe￾sion at high shear in hematopoietic cells (1). Although the role of

the lesion site is well established, their role in platelet-endothe￾lium adhesion in vivo is incompletely understood so far. In vitro,
both β3 integrins (αIIbβ3 and αvβ3) have been shown to mediate
firm platelet-endothelium adhesion under static conditions (9,
10). In vivo, firm platelet adhesion to the endothelium can be
inhibited by anti-αIIbβ3 mAb, and platelets defective in αIIbβ3 do
not firmly adhere to activated ECs (19). Thus, although we are
just starting to understand the molecular requirements of plate￾let-endothelium adhesion under dynamic conditions, it seems to
be a well-controlled multistep process involving interaction of
platelet PSGL-1 or GPIbα with endothelial P-selectin (“rolling”)
followed by subsequent β3 integrin–mediated firm platelet adhe￾sion. These receptor-dependent platelet-EC interactions allow
transcellular communication via soluble mediators and might
therefore play an important role in the initiation and progression
of vascular inflammation (Figure 2).
Platelet-derived mediators stimulate inflammation
During the adhesion process, platelets become activated and
release an arsenal of potent inflammatory and mitogenic sub￾stances into the local microenvironment, thereby altering
chemotactic, adhesive, and proteolytic properties of ECs (24).
These platelet-induced alterations of the endothelial phenotype
support chemotaxis, adhesion, and transmigration of monocytes
to the site of inflammation (Figure 2).
Released from dense granules, α-granules, lysosomes, the cana￾licular system, or the cytosol, platelets secrete or expose adhesion
proteins (e.g., fibrinogen, fibronectin, vWF, thrombospondin,
vitronectin, P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa), growth factors (e.g., PDGF,
TGF-β, EGF, bFGF), chemokines (e.g., RANTES, platelet fac￾tor 4 [CXC chemokine ligand 4], epithelial neutrophil-activat￾ing protein 78 [CXC chemokine ligand 5]), cytokine-like factors
(e.g., IL-1β, CD40 ligand, β-thromboglobulin), and coagulation
factors (e.g., factor V, factor XI, PAI-1, plasminogen, protein S).
These proteins act in a concerted and finely regulated manner to
influence widely differing biological functions such as cell adhe￾sion, cell aggregation, chemotaxis, cell survival and proliferation,
coagulation, and proteolysis, all of which accelerate inflamma￾tory processes and cell recruitment. For example, IL-1β has been
identified as a major mediator of platelet-induced activation of
ECs (25, 26). The IL-1β activity expressed by platelets appears
to be associated with the platelet surface, and coincubation of
ECs with thrombin-activated platelets induces IL-1β–dependent
secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 from ECs(26). Furthermore, incubation
of cultured ECs with thrombin-stimulated platelets significantly
enhances the secretion of endothelial monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1) in an IL-1β–dependent manner (12). MCP-1
belongs to the CC family of chemokines and is thought to play a
key role in the regulation of monocyte recruitment to inflamed
tissue and in atherosclerosis (27, 28).
However, platelet IL-1β does not only modify endothelial
release of chemotactic proteins. IL-1β additionally can increase
endothelial expression of adhesion molecules. Surface expression
of ICAM-1 and αvβ3 on ECs is significantly enhanced by activated
platelets via IL-1β (12). Both enhanced chemokine release and
upregulation of endothelial adhesion moleculesthrough platelet￾derived IL-1β act in concert and promote neutrophil and mono￾cyte adhesion to the endothelium. IL-1β–dependent expression of
early inflammatory genes,such as MCP-1 or ICAM-1, involvesthe
activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Transient adhesion
of platelets to the endothelium initiates degradation of IκB and
supports activation of NF-κB in ECs, thereby inducing NF-κB–
dependent chemokine gene transcription (29, 30). Likewise,

milieu that supports proatherogenic alterations of endothelium.

platelet-induced NF-κB activation was largely reduced by IL-1β
antagonists, which supports the notion that platelet IL-1β is the
molecular determinant of platelet-dependent activation of the
transcription factor. Activation of NF-κB involves a cascade of
phosphorylation processes. One family of kinases that isinvolved
in NF-κB–dependent gene expression is the MAPKs, such as p38
MAPK. In a manner similar to that of recombinant human IL-1β,
activated platelets have the potential to induce phosphorylation
of p38 MAPK. Correspondingly, transfection of a dominant-neg￾ative p38 mutant significantly reduced platelet-induced MCP-1
secretion in ECs (31).
Once recruited to the vascular wall, platelets may promote
inflammation by chemoattraction of leukocytes through media￾tors such as platelet-activating factor and macrophage inflamma￾tory protein-1α, may stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation
(TGF-β, PDGF,serotonin) (32), and may contribute to matrix deg￾radation by secretion of MMP-2 (33).
A finely regulated functional interaction of platelets with chem￾okines has also been implicated in atherogenesis (34). Activated
platelets can release chemokines and can induce the secretion of
chemokines in various cells of the vascular wall; in turn, certain
chemokines can enhance platelet aggregation and adhesion in
combination with primary agonists and can trigger monocyte
recruitment (35). One such candidate for monocyte recruitment
is RANTES, which has been shown to trigger monocyte arrest on
inflamed and atherosclerotic endothelium (35). Deposition of
platelet-derived RANTES induces monocyte recruitment medi￾ated by P-selectin (36, 37). Another platelet-derived chemokine
is platelet factor 4 (PF4), the most abundant protein secreted
by activated platelets. First, PF4 acts as a chemoattractant for
monocytes promoting their differentiation into macrophages
(38). Second, PF4 may directly aggravate the atherogenic actions
of hypercholesterolemia by promoting the retention of lipopro￾teins. Sachais and colleagues have recently shown that PF4 can
facilitate the retention of LDL on cell surfaces by inhibition of its
degradation by the LDL receptor (39). In addition, PF4 markedly
enhancesthe esterification and uptake of oxidized LDL by macro￾phages (40). The fact that PF4 has been found in human athero￾sclerotic lesions and was found associated with macrophages in
early lesions and with foam cells in more advanced lesions (41)
supports the concept that PF4 released from locally activated
platelets enters the vessel wall and promotes vascular inflamma￾tion and atherogenesis.
Furthermore, release of platelet-derived CD40 ligand (CD40L,
CD154) induces inflammatory responses in endothelium. Henn
et al. (42) showed that platelets store CD40L in high amounts
and release it within seconds after activation in vitro. Ligation
of CD40 on ECs by CD40L expressed on the surface of activated
platelets increased the release of IL-8 and MCP-1, the principal
chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes (42). In addi￾tion, platelet CD40L enhanced the expression of endothelial
adhesion receptors including E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1,
all molecules that mediate the attachment of neutrophils,
monocytes, and lymphocytes to the inflamed vessel wall (42).
Moreover, CD40L induces endothelial tissue factor expression
(43). Hence, like IL-1β, CD40L expressed on plateletsinduces ECs
to release chemokines and to express adhesion molecules, there￾by generating signals for the recruitment of leukocytes in the
process of inflammation. CD40 ligation on ECs, smooth muscle
cells, and macrophages initiates the expression and release of
matrix-degrading enzymes, the MMPs. These enzymes, which
degrade ECM proteins, significantly contribute to destruction
and remodeling of inflamed tissue. Activated platelets release
MMP-2 during aggregation (33, 44). Furthermore, adhesion of
activated platelets to ECs results in generation and secretion of
MMP-9 and of the protease receptor urokinase-type plasmino￾gen activator receptor (uPAR) on cultured endothelium (45).
The endothelial release of MMP-9 is dependent on both the
fibrinogen receptor GPIIb/IIIa and CD40L, since inhibition
of either mechanism resulted in reduction of platelet-induced
matrix degradation activity of ECs. Moreover, GPIIb/IIIa liga￾tion results in substantial release of CD40L in the absence of any
further platelet agonist (45, 46) (Figure 2). These results suggest
that the release of platelet-derived proinflammatory mediators
like CD40L is dependent on GPIIb/IIIa–mediated adhesion. This
mechanism may be pathophysiologically important to localize
platelet-induced inflammation of the endothelium at a site of
firm platelet-endothelium adhesion.
Figure 3
Adherent platelets recruit and inflame monocytes. Adherent and/
or activated platelets mainly interact with monocytic PSGL-1 via 
P-selectin and with monocytic Mac-1 (αMβ2) via αIIbβ3 (and fibrinogen 
bridging) or GPIbα. Thereby, platelets initiate monocyte secretion 
of chemokines, cytokines, and procoagulatory tissue factor, upreg￾ulate and activate adhesion receptors and proteases, and induce 
monocyte differentiation into macrophages. Thus, platelet-monocyte 
interaction provides an atherogenic milieu at the vascular wall that 
supports plaque formation.

Platelets synthesize biologically active proteins
The platelet “secretome” is derived from intracellular storage gran￾ules, eicosanoid and phospholipid synthesis (47), and, as recently
recognized,synthesis of proteinsfrom constitutive mRNAs(48–50).
It is now clear that platelets synthesize biologically relevant pro￾teinsin response to physiologicalstimuli that are regulated via gene
expression programs at the translational level (51). A small amount
of constitutive protein synthesis (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa, vWF) occurs in
nonstimulated platelets (52). However, synthesis of specific pro￾teinsisremarkably enhanced in response to activation. Itseemsthat
the pattern of protein synthesis is dependent on distinct agonists
and requires ligation and engagement of β3 integrins for maximal
production of the protein product. For example, platelet activation
throughplatelet-activating factor orthrombininducesrapidand sus￾tained synthesis of pro–IL-1β and processing into active IL-1β (49).
The recent integration of proteomics into biochemical and biologi￾cal platelet research has proved to be a powerful tool in understand￾ing platelet function. Although platelet proteomics is a young field,
remarkable advances have already been accomplished.To date, more
than 300 proteinsreleased by human platelets afterthrombin activa￾tion have been identified (53, 54).Coppinger et al.showed that,while
absent in normal vasculature, a variety of newly described platelet￾derived proteins that may promote atherogenesis(e.g., secretoganin
III, calumenin, cyclophilin A) are present in human atherosclerotic
tissue (54). Thus, proteomics and analysis of activation-dependent
protein synthesis open a new and promising direction of platelet
research and may disclose novel molecular mechanisms of platelet￾mediated inflammation and atherothrombosis.
Platelet interactions with leukocytes
When activated, platelets coaggregate with circulating leuko￾cytes (55). Once adherent to the vascular wall, platelets also
provide a sticky surface to recruit leukocytes to the vessel wall.
Recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the vascular wall
requires multistep adhesive and signaling events that result in
the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the blood vessel wall,
including selectin-mediated attachment and rolling, leukocyte
activation, integrin-mediated firm adhesion, and diapedesis.
Leukocytes tether to adherent platelets via PSGL-1–P-selectin
interactions (56, 57) and, subsequently, firmly adhere via bind￾ing of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18, αMβ2) to GPIbα (58) and/or other
receptors of the platelet membrane, including JAM-3 (59) and
ICAM-2 (60), or bridging proteins such as fibrinogen (bound to
GPIIb/IIIa) (61, 62) or high–molecular weight kininogen (bound
to GPIbα) (63) (Figure 3). However, the exact contribution of
each system remains to be elucidated in vivo. During this adhe￾sive process, receptor engagement of PSGL-1 and Mac-1 together
with platelet-derived inflammatory compounds induces inflam￾matory cascades in monocytes (64, 65). In addition, engagement
of PSGL-1 by P-selectin also drives translationally regulated
expression of proteins such as uPAR, a critical surface protease
receptor and regulator of integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion
in vivo (66–68) (Figure 3).
Platelets in animal models of atherosclerosis
Abundant recent data support the concept of atherosclerosis
as a chronic inflammatory disease (69). However, the contribu￾tion of platelets to the process of atherosclerosis was unclear
for decades. With the help of intravital microscopy and the
availability of appropriate atherosclerotic animal models, it
has become evident that platelets adhere to the arterial wall in
vivo even in the absence of EC denudation (70, 71). Theilmeier
and coworkers found in hypercholesteremic rabbits that plate￾lets adhere to predilection sites of atherosclerosis before lesions
Figure 4
Hypothetical model of atherogenesis triggered by platelets. Activated platelets roll along the endothelial monolayer via GPIbα/P-selectin or 
PSGL-1/P-selectin. Thereafter, platelets firmly adhere to vascular endothelium via β3 integrins, release proinflammatory compounds (IL-1β, 
CD40L), and induce a proatherogenic phenotype of ECs (chemotaxis, MCP-1; adhesion, ICAM-1). Subsequently, adherent platelets recruit 
circulating leukocytes, bind them, and inflame them by receptor interactions and paracrine pathways, thereby initiating leukocyte transmigration 
and foam cell formation. Thus, platelets provide the inflammatory basis for plaque formation before physically occluding the vessel by thrombosis 
upon plaque rupture.

are detectable (70). Recently, we showed that platelets adhere
to the vascular endothelium of the carotid artery in apoE-defi￾cient mice before the development of manifest atherosclerotic
lesions (71). Substantial platelet adhesion to the carotid artery
early in atherogenesis involved both platelet GPIbα and αIIbβ3.
Platelet adhesion to the carotid wall coincided with inflamma￾tory gene expression and preceded the invasion of leukocytes
(71). Prolonged antibody blockade of platelet GPIbα profound￾ly reduced leukocyte accumulation in the arterial intima and
attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation. Moreover, apoE￾deficient mice lacking GPIIb exhibit substantially reduced
formation of atherosclerotic lesions (72). Further, circulating
activated platelets and platelet–leukocyte/monocyte aggregates
promote formation of atherosclerotic lesions (73). The impor￾tance of P-selectin for atherosclerotic lesion development has
also been described (74–76). The importance of platelets in
development of atherosclerosis is also documented by Belton
et al., who showed that inhibition of COX-1, an enzyme that
is exclusively present in platelets, prevented gross lesion for￾mation in apoE–/– mice (77). Interestingly, effective inhibition
of downstream activation cascades can also effectively inhibit
atherosclerosis in various models. The body of evidence impli￾cating the CD40-CD40L system in atherogenesis is compelling:
Disruption of CD40-CD40L in mouse models of atheroscle￾rosis both downregulated early disease events such as initial
plaque formation (78, 79) and could halt the progression of
established lesions to more advanced unstable lesions (80). Fur￾ther, IL-1–dependent mechanisms have been shown to promote
atherogenesis in mice in vivo (81, 82).
Together, these in vitro and in vivo data overwhelmingly sup￾port the hypothesis that platelets trigger early events of athero￾genesis and are critical for atherosclerotic lesion formation in
mice (Figure 4). This complex process appears to require adhe￾sive mechanisms mediated, basically, by PSGL-1/P-selectin and
β3 integrins. Adhesion-induced secretion of proatherogenic pro￾teins (e.g., CD40L, IL-1β) and incorporation of platelet-derived
products (e.g., PF4) result in inflammation of the vessel wall and
subsequent vascular remodeling.
However, the results from mouse models cannot be uncritically
transferred to the human situation, since mouse platelets dif￾fer substantially from human platelets in several respects (e.g.,
higher platelet count, different expression profile of surface
receptors). What is the evidence that platelets are also linked to
atheroprogression in humans?
Platelets and atherosclerosis in humans
The availability of conclusive data obtained in humansis very lim￾ited. Nevertheless, there issome evidence that platelets are involved
in atheroprogression in humans. An increase in systemic platelet
activation has been described for a variety of atherosclerotic dis￾eases, including coronary artery disease (83), transplant vasculop￾athy (84), and carotid artery disease (85). Recently, it was found
that activation of circulating plateletsis associated with enhanced
wall thickness of the carotid artery in humans (85, 86). Enhanced
systemic platelet activation correlates with progression of intima
media thickness of the carotid artery in type 2 diabetes(85). More￾over, PF4 (41) and other platelet-derived chemokines and growth
factors(54) are found in human atherosclerotic plaques. Previous￾ly, we reported that systemic platelet activation is associated with
an accelerated progression of transplant vasculopathy (84). Cur￾rent antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel) do not seem to have
a major impact on atheroprogression in humans. However, most
antiplatelet strategies in high-risk patients have been applied for
secondary prevention at a rather advanced atherosclerotic disease
state. Clinical studies are required that evaluate the efficacy of a
long-term antiplateletstrategy for primary prevention in high-risk
patients at an early stage of atherosclerotic disease.
Future considerations
It has become clear that, besides their role in hemostasis and
thrombosis, platelets regulate a variety of inflammatory respons￾es and are key players in atherothrombosis. Thrombosis and
inflammation are therefore linked rather than separate entities.
Because atherothrombotic diseases are a major cause of morbid￾ity and mortality in developed countries, understanding the role
of platelets in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis is an
important challenge. Major achievements have been made in
elucidating the molecular mechanisms of platelet interaction
with ECs of the arterial wall. Defining the specific requirements
for platelets adhering to endothelium may lead to the develop￾ment of novel therapeutic strategies. The era of genomics and
proteomics has recently been introduced in platelet research and
will continue to offer major tools to help understand platelet
pathology in the course of atherosclerosis.
