Unscrambling hepatitis C virus–host
interactions
Francis V. Chisari1
The human suffering exacted by the hepatitis C virus is enormous. Hundreds of thousands of people die 
each year from liver failure and cancer caused by this infection. There is no vaccine, and the available 
antiviral drugs are toxic, expensive and only partly effective. Progress has been hindered by the absence 
of cell culture and small-animal models of the infection. Nonetheless, recent advances have yielded several
promising new antiviral drugs and enhanced the prospects of developing a vaccine. The recent development
of a robust in vitro hepatitis C virus infection system will aid this search.
a minus-strand intermediate in a membrane-bounded compartment13,
yielding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates. The replicative
intermediates are fully exposed to the cell dsRNA-sensing machinery14,15
and induce strong innate cellular responses following infection. 
Although much of our understanding of HCV replication is based
on subgenomic and genomic replicon systems developed by Barten￾schlager and colleagues16, little is known about the mechanisms and
host functions involved in viral entry, uncoating, trafficking, assembly
and egress. However, three independent groups have recently reported
the development of a robust HCV infection system in vitro17–19, which
should make these processes experimentally accessible.
This new system is based on a unique HCV genome (JFH1) derived
from the blood of a Japanese patient with fulminant hepatitis20 and has
extraordinary replicative capacity in vitro21 (see review in this issue by
Lindenbach and Rice, page 933). The ability to perform reverse-genet￾ics experiments will facilitate identification of the unique elements
required for infectivity in vitro and help understand their specific roles.
Moreover, by making each step of the viral life cycle experimentally
accessible, this system will assist the development of antiviral drugs
and help analyse the neutralizing and curative potential of candidate
vaccines.
The host–virus relationship
In common with other persistent viruses, HCV does not kill the cells
it infects, but triggers an immune-mediated inflammatory response
(hepatitis) that either rapidly clears the infection or slowly destroys the
liver, causing the development of HCC (see review in this issue by
Bowen and Walker, page 946). The outcome is largely determined by
the efficiency of the antiviral immune response. Host–virus interac￾tions are ideally investigated in cell culture and small-animal models;
the former are only now becoming available. Nonetheless, many of the
factors that determine the outcome of HCV infection are beginning to
come into focus (see reviews in this issue by Gale and Foy, and Bowen
and Walker, pages 939 and 946, respectively).
Host–outcome determinants
Innate immune response
HCV spreads rapidly in the liver after inoculation22,23, and so the innate
immune response might be expected to influence the outcome of
infection. Indeed, prospective genomic analysis of the intrahepatic
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a noncytopathic hepatotropic member
of the Flaviviridae that causes acute and chronic hepatitis, and hepa￾tocellular carcinoma (HCC; Fig. 1)1
. The liver is its primary target
organ, and the hepatocyte is its primary target cell. More than 170 mil￾lion people are currently infected with HCV2
. Acute infection is usu￾ally asymptomatic, making early diagnosis difficult. A notable feature
of HCV infection is its tendency towards chronicity: ~70% of acute
infections become persistent, and chronic cases are often associated
with serious liver disease1 (Fig. 2). As a result, HCV infection is a lead￾ing killer worldwide and the commonest cause of liver failure in the
United States (see review in this issue by Brown, page 973). 
In common with hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency (HIV)
viruses, HCV is primarily transmitted percutaneously3
. Before the
development of diagnostic tests, the infection was commonly passed
on through blood and related products4
, haemodialysis5 and organ
transplantation6
. Today, HCV primarily affects injecting drug users
and their sexual partners6
. It is a particular problem in correctional
facilities, where 20–40% of inmates are infected, in contrast to ~2% of
the general population7
. It is opportunistic in HIV-infected individu￾als, ~25% of whom are co-infected with HCV (this figure rises to
50–90% among injecting drug users)8
. Co-infection causes higher
HCV titres and a more rapid progression to cirrhosis8
.
The virus and its life cycle
HCV infects only humans and chimpanzees; there are no small-ani￾mal models. Moreover, until recently, cell culture systems were not
available. Most of our knowledge of HCV has been derived from sur￾rogate experimental systems that approximate true infection and
often preclude definitive interpretation. Nonetheless, much has been
learned in the 16 years since the HCV genome was first cloned by
Houghton and colleagues9
.
The HCV genome is a 9.6-kilobase uncapped linear single-stranded
RNA (ssRNA) molecule with positive polarity. It contains 5 and 3
untranslated regions (UTRs) including control elements required for
translation and replication10 (see review in this issue by Lindenbach and
Rice, page 933). The UTRs flank an uninterrupted open reading frame
encoding a single polyprotein of 3,010 or 3,011 amino acids, which is
processed into structural (C, E1, E2 and p7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3,
NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) subunits by host and viral proteases11,12.
The HCV life cycle is entirely cytoplasmic. Replication occurs through

the virus instead of the host (see review in this issue by Feld and Hoof￾nagle, page 967). The mutation rate of HCV is high (10–3 per nucleotide
per generation), as is its replication rate (~1012 virions per day in
humans)26. This results in explosive expansion of the virus after inocula￾tion and in the evolution of numerous viral quasispecies in each infected
subject, which could influence the magnitude and efficacy of the antivi￾ral immune response. Moreover, the virus produces a constant stream of
escape variants that outrun the immune response and can eventually
produce mutants with no corresponding receptors in the immunologi￾cal repertoire23,25. The influence of these parameters on the outcome of
infection has been studied in a few acutely infected humans and chim￾panzees and in many chronically infected individuals. The results show
that B- and T-cell escape mutants are selected by the immune response
during HCV infection and probably contribute to viral persistence (see
review in this issue by Bowen and Walker, page 946).
Viral evasion strategies
The primary immune-evasion strategies fall into two distinct categ￾ories: subversion of the IFN response induced by the virus and muta￾tional escape from the adaptive immune response.
According to the first strategy, when HCV infects the liver, it trig￾gers the production of IFN and a range of antiviral genes that should
control the infection — but do not22,27. In fact, HCV seems to be resis￾tant to these antiviral pathways, at least in the HCV replicon system,
and several structural and nonstructural proteins have been shown to
inhibit nonoverlapping functions of the innate immune response (see
review in this issue by Gale and Foy, page 939). For example, the Gale
group has shown that NS3/4A can block the phosphorylation and
effector action of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)28 by inactivating sig￾nalling by retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)29, a cytoplasmic
dsRNA-binding protein that activates cellular kinases that stimulate
IRF3 (ref. 15). So, HCV seems to use several strategies to actively evade
the immune responses that it induces. However, these evasion strat￾egies were defined either biochemically or in transfected cell-culture
systems, not in infected cells. It is premature to assume that they occur
during natural infection until they have been validated in vivo or at
least in the newly developed tissue-culture model of HCV infection.
Regarding the second strategy, mutational inactivation of B- and T￾cell epitopes is common in HCV infection (see review in this issue by
Bowen and Walker, page 946). B-cell epitopes are concentrated in the
hypervariable region of the E2 protein30, probably allowing the virus to
persist in the presence of antibody that is neutralizing for its ancestors.
The T-cell epitope mutations span the viral polyprotein31, often in
residues that bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mole￾cules or are otherwise involved in antigen presentation. Mutations also
occur in residues engaged by the T-cell receptor (TCR), making
infected cells invisible to T cells expressing the corresponding TCR32.
Although mutational escape probably contributes to the persistence of
the virus, it is less clear whether it determines the outcome. Several
groups have shown an association between certain human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) alleles and the outcome of HCV infection25. These dif￾ferences might influence the breadth of the TCR repertoire and the ease
with which the virus can escape. Confirmation of this hypothesis would
be facilitated by an inbred mouse model of HCV infection.
What about treatment?
The standard treatment for chronic HCV infection is pegylated IFN-
plus ribavirin33 (see review in this issue by Feld and Hoofnagle, page
967). Although the mechanism of action of these drugs is debated, with
both antiviral and immunostimulatory mechanisms being implicated34,
the sustained response (cure) rates are far from ideal. Moreover, there
is substantial associated toxicity35, and the likelihood of success
depends on viral and host factors that are often beyond the control of
patients and physicians. Clearly, more effective and less toxic treatment
regimens are needed.
Thanks to the HCV replicon system, much recent effort has been
directed towards developing drugs that inhibit viral replication. Sev￾innate immune response in acutely infected chimpanzees suggests that
HCV triggers a strong type-1 interferon (IFN-/) response as it
spreads22,24, but resists the effector functions of the downstream anti￾viral target genes that it induces. Importantly, the response is similar
in animals that clear the infection and those that become persistently
infected22,24, implying that any influence on the outcome is indirect or
obscure. Whatever its function, the innate intracellular immune
response probably has a role in controlling HCV infection because the
virus has developed several strategies to evade it (see review in this
issue by Gale and Foy, page 939).
Adaptive immune response
The clearest determinants of the outcome of HCV infection are the mag￾nitude, diversity and quality of the adaptive immune response. Viral
clearance during self-limited infection is characterized by vigorous poly￾clonal CD4+ and CD8+T-cell responses that are relatively weak and nar￾rowly focused in chronically infected humans and chimpanzees.
Moreover, the onset of viral clearance and liver disease coincide with that
of the T-cell response and the entry of virus-specific T cells into the liver;
primary failure to induce a T-cell response or functional exhaustion of
an initially vigorous response predict viral persistence23,25. However, the
basis for variable immunological responsiveness to HCV has largely
remained elusive. Indeed, we do not know whether the failure to
respond vigorously in persistently infected subjects is caused by antigen
overload during immunological priming, virus-induced defects in anti￾gen presentation, hyperinduction of regulatory T cells, genetically deter￾mined restriction of the virus-specific T-cell repertoire or other causes
(see review in this issue by Bowen and Walker, page 946). Therefore,
whereas both primary and secondary immunological hyporesponsive￾ness to HCV seem to contribute to the establishment and maintenance
of persistent infection, the reasons why they occur in selected subjects
remain to be determined. Moreover, the virus can persist despite a mul￾tispecific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response23,25 by progressive mutational
escape, which confirms the importance of the immune response in viral
clearance and disease pathogenesis. An inbred mouse model of HCV
infection would greatly facilitate these studies.
Viral outcome determinants
The viral factors influencing the outcome of HCV infection are begin￾ning to come into focus.
HCV genotypes, replication and mutation rates
The six distinct genotypes of HCV show marked differences in geo￾graphic distribution, disease progression and response to therapy. How￾ever, the complex epidemiological differences in patient groups infected
with each genotype make it difficult to ascribe variability in outcome to

eral promising small-molecule inhibitors of the NS3/4A protease and
the NS5B polymerase are in development (see review in this issue by
De Francesco and Migliaccio, page 953). Early testing has uncovered
strong antiviral activity both in vitro and in patients36. As expected,
escape variants have been rapidly selected by each drug, indicating that
drug cocktails will probably be required to control this infection.
The hope is to target all aspects of the viral life cycle therapeutically,
including those that are inaccessible using the replicon system. Indeed,
this is becoming possible owing to the in vitro HCV infection model
mentioned above17–19.
De Francesco and Migliaccio also describe efforts to stimulate the
innate immune response in chronically infected subjects. Furthermore,
several groups are attempting to activate the adaptive immune response
with therapeutic vaccines37 (see reviews in this issue by Houghton and
Abrignani, and Bowen and Walker, pages 961 and 946, respectively).
Harnessing the immune response makes sense, as it is curative in sub￾jects who spontaneously clear HCV infection and could potentially elim￾inate the drug-resistant viral clones selected by emerging antiviral drugs. 
Prospects for a preventive vaccine
Developing a preventive vaccine is arguably the ultimate objective of
this research. Traditional vaccine development based on the antibody
response preventing incoming viruses from reaching their cellular tar￾gets has been challenging for mutation-prone HCV, which generates
numerous antibody escape mutants38.
Nonetheless, a vaccine might be within reach. Chimpanzees that are
rechallenged after clearance of a primary HCV infection are protected
against homologous and heterologous viral isolates39. Moreover, those
immunized with an adjuvanted recombinant HCV envelope vaccine that
elicits E2 glycoprotein-specific antibodies and T-cell help are largely pro￾tected from chronic infection when challenged with a heterologous viral
inoculum (see review in this issue by Houghton and Abrignani, page
961). This is a considerable advance, even though the immunized chim￾panzees become acutely infected, because the morbidity of HCV is largely
a consequence of chronic infection, from which they are protected.
As spontaneous viral clearance during acute HCV infection is char￾acterized by a vigorous broadly reactive CD4+ and CD8+T-cell response,
much effort is being made to develop T-cell-based vaccines. Approaches
include DNA-prime–protein boost, DNA-prime–poxvirus boost, recom￾binant adenovirus and Semliki Forest virus vectors, and recombinant -
viral particles (see review in this issue by Houghton and Abrignani, page
961). Despite their limitations, these techniques potentially offer
enhanced immunogenicity, the ability to induce antibody as well as T-cell
responses and the flexibility to stimulate cross-protective immunity.
Where do we go from here?
We arrive at the end of this article with more questions than answers as
we try to understand the viral life cycle, the factors that determine the
outcome of infection and how to develop a vaccine and more effective
drugs for the prevention and treatment of HCV infection. We know that
the virus infects the liver, but how many hepatocytes are infected, are
other cells affected and does it disrupt luxury functions or have direct
cytopathic effects? We know that HCV spreads and mutates rapidly and
that a huge number of virions are produced every day. But we don’t know
the extent to which small differences in these parameters allow it to out￾run the immune response and persist in certain patients. The virus sur￾vives despite a strong innate intracellular IFN response and has evolved
the means to evade it, yet is the outcome determined by an undefined
counter-regulatory gene or isoform expressed only in subjects who clear
the infection? We know that certain HCV proteins can blunt the anti￾viral effects of IFN in transfected cells that overexpress them, but does
this occur during natural infection in vivo? Viral clearance is associated
with a sustained vigorous polyclonal adaptive immune response, yet why
do some individuals mount such a response and others do not? Such
questions must be answered to understand the outcome determinants,
and prevent and terminate persistent HCV infection. New experimen￾tal systems are urgently needed if we wish to answer those difficult ques￾tions. The recent development of a cell-culture system supporting robust
HCV infection17–19 is a huge step in the right direction. ■
