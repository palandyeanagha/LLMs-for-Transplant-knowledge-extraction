Abstract


Objective: To define the natural history of idiopathic restrictive
cardiomyopathy in a paediatric population and to identify any
factors predictive of outcome.
Design: Retrospective analysis of patients born between 1970 and
2002 were identified from the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh
cardiology database. Demographic data, mode of presentation,
echocardiographic and haemodynamic findings at diagnosis,
survival time, and manner of death were evaluated.
Setting: Tertiary referral and transplant centre for paediatric
patients with cardiac disease.
Patients: All local and referred patients with idiopathic restrictive
cardiomyopathy born after 1970 and under 21 years of age at time
of diagnosis.
Results: 21 patients were identified. Probability of survival at 1, 5,
and 10 years was 80.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58 to 100),
39% (95% CI 17 to 61), and 20% (95% CI 0 to 42), respectively.
Median age of presentation was 3.8 years (mean (SD) 5.7 (6.1)
years). Median survival without transplantation was 2.2 years
(mean (SD) 4.6 (5.4) years). Age at presentation, sex, and presence
or absence of heart failure symptoms at presentation were not
associated with clinical course. Right (p  =  0.05) and left
ventricular end diastolic pressures (p  =  0.04) and ratio of left
atrial to aortic root dimensions (LA:Ao) (p  =  0.03) at presentation
had a significantly negative correlation with survival time after
diagnosis.
Conclusions: Without transplantation, most children with
restrictive cardiomyopathy have a very poor prognosis. Longer
survival from diagnosis was correlated with lower LA:Ao and
cardiac filling pressures at diagnosis. Survival time was not
influenced by the symptoms present at diagnosis.
