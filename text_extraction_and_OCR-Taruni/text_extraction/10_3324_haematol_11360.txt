Background and Objectives
The elective treatment of patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders
is controversial. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment
with extended doses of rituximab adapted to the response in patients with post-trans￾plant lymphoproliferative disorders after solid organ transplantation.
Design and Methods
This was a prospective, multicenter, phase II trial. Patients were treated with reduc￾tion of immunosuppression and four weekly infusions of rituximab. Those patients
who did not achieve complete remission (CR) received a second course of four ritux￾imab infusions. The primary end-point of the study was the CR rate. 
Results
Thirty-eight patients were assesable. One episode of grade 4 neutropenia was the
only severe adverse event observed. After the first course of rituximab, 13 (34.2%)
patients achieved CR, 8 patients did not respond, and 17 patients achieved partial
remission. Among those 17 patients, 12 could be treated with a second course of rit￾uximab, and 10 (83.3%) achieved CR, yielding an intention-to-treat CR rate of 60.5%.
Eight patients excluded from the trial because of absence of CR were treated with rit￾uximab combined with chemotherapy, and six (75%) achieved CR. Event-free survival
was 42% and overall survival was 47% at 27.5 months. Fourteen patients died, ten
of progression of their post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. 
Interpretation and Conclusions
These results confirm that extended treatment with rituximab can obtain a high rate
of CR in patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after solid organ
transplantation without increasing toxicity, and should be recommended as initial ther￾apy for these patients.

ABSTRACT

P
ost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders are a
serious complication of prolonged immunosuppres￾sion in recipients of solid organ transplants. The
reported incidence varies from 1% to 5%.1,2 Risk factors
for the development of post-transplant lymphoprolifera￾tive disorders include intense immunosuppressive thera￾py2 and primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.3,4 The
most common pathological finding is EBV-driven B-cell
proliferation, ranging from B-cell hyperplasia to overt B￾cell lymphoma.5,6 These malignancies tend to behave
more aggressively and, in general, to have poorer out￾comes than lymphomas occurring in non-immunocom￾promised patients. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disorder remains a major cause of morbidity and mortal￾ity and about 50% of patients with this disorder die
within a short period after its diagnosis.7
Reduction of immunosuppression remains the stan￾dard front-line therapy, with response rates ranging from
20% to 85%, with localized or polymorphic disease
more likely to respond.8,9 The elective treatment of
patients in whom reduction of immunosuppression fails
is controversial. The different therapeutic approaches
have often been based on clinical outcome of limited
series of patients. The therapeutic efficacy of antiviral
therapy has not been proven.10 Surgery and radiotherapy
may be efficacious in some cases of localized post-trans￾plant lymphoproliferative disorders.11 Different chemo￾therapy regimens have been used, but have usually been
associated with high toxicity, especially in patients with
poor performance status at diagnosis, and the response
rate has been poor, ranging from 25% to 35%.12,13 As a
result of the poor response to conventional therapies,
alternative treatment options have been tried in recent
years. Ongoing clinical trials on the infusion of expanded
HLA-identical EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells have given
promising, but still preliminary, results.14 Therapy with
monoclonal antibodies has been used for several years.
Monoclonal anti-CD21 and anti-CD24 B-cell antibodies
were studied in open label trials, yielding a response rate
of 60%, but these antibodies are no longer produced.15,16
The chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab
has been demonstrated to be an effective therapy for B￾cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and has also been used
in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Many
case reports and some retrospective analyses have shown
that rituximab is effective in the treatment of CD20-
positve post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders.17,18
The first large prospective phase II study was recently
published. This trial included 43 patients assessable for
efficacy who were treated with four standard doses of
rituximab.19
We conducted a prospective, multicenter, phase II trial
in 41 patients with B-cell post-transplant lymphoprolifer￾ative disorders after solid organ transplantation, examin￾ing the effect of treatment with reduction of immuno￾suppression and extended doses of rituximab according
to the early response.
Design and Methods
All patients were treated in compliance with regulations
and guidelines of the Institutional Review Boards of the par￾ticipating centers. Between November 2000 and August
2005, 41 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with B-cell
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after solid
organ transplantation were included in this prospective trial.
The study was conducted in 12 Spanish centers. Three
patients were excluded from the analyses. One was an 11-
year-old boy, another patient died before starting treatment,
and one patient had a B-cell post-transplant lymphoprolifer￾ative disorder after peripheral blood stem cell transplanta￾tion. Therefore, 38 patients were assessable.
Study eligibility
Patients were eligible for inclusion in this study if they
were adults older than 18 years of age, had signed informed
consent and had an untreated B-cell post-transplant lympho￾proliferative disorder with CD20 expression in neoplastic
tissue. Another inclusion criteria was the absence of
response within 2 weeks after discontinuation or reduction
of immunosuppressive drug therapy; however, patients
who had a poor performance status at diagnosis in whom it
was clinically unfeasible to wait for the effect of reduction of
immunosuppression were also included. A poor perform￾ance status was not an exclusion criterion. The local trans￾plant teams decided changes of immunosuppressive thera￾py. Patients with central nervous system disease or any seri￾ous concomitant disease were not eligible. All patients
underwent evaluation for disease extent before entry into
the study. The evaluation included an assessment of clinical
symptoms, a physical examination, computed tomography
scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, and bone marrow biop￾sy. In some patients a gallium scintigraphy was performed. 
Treatment
Treatment consisted of four rituximab infusions, each
of 375 mg/m2
, on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Response was
evaluated 4 to 8 weeks after the end of treatment. If
patients achieved CR, they were followed without fur￾ther treatment. Patients who achieved a partial remis￾sion (PR) were treated again with another four weekly
rituximab infusions at the same doses, and response
was again evaluated 4 to 8 weeks later. Premedication
consisting of paracetamol and dipheniramine was
administered before each rituximab infusion. Patients
without a response and patients with progression were
excluded from the study and were able to receive other
treatments, although a short course of 3-4 cycles of rit￾uximab combined with CHOP-like chemotherapy regi￾mens was recommended. Treatment was stopped if
there was no response, if the lymphoma progressed, if
the patient refused to continue, or if the investigator
considered it necessary because of concomitant illness
or adverse events.

Study end-point
The primary end-point was the CR rate 4 to 8 weeks
after the end of therapy. Tumor response was assessed by
computed tomography scan, gallium scintigraphy in
some cases and bone marrow biopsy if there was initial
involvement of the marrow. The efficacy of treatment
was classified as: CR, defined as no evidence of disease in
terms of clinical symptoms, biopsy or imaging findings;
PR, defined as a reduction of more than 50% of the tumor
mass, with disappearance of the initial symptoms; and
failure, defined as a less than 50% reduction of the tumor
mass or disease progression. The overall response rate
was defined as the sum of the CR and PR rates.
Statistical methods
All analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat
basis. Results of the descriptive analysis are expressed as
medians and limits for continuous data and number of
cases with their proportions for qualitative data. Odds
ratios (OR) were calculated using unconditional logistic
regression techniques. All logistic regression models were
fitted using the maximum likelihood estimation of
parameters. All variables were entered into the regression
analysis as categorical variables with two categories
coded 0 (absent) or 1 (present). Statistical significance was
established at an α value of 0.05, and, accordingly, 95%
confidence intervals (CI) around the OR are presented.
Survival analysis was performed by means of Kaplan￾Meier techniques. The Cox proportional hazard regres￾sion model was used to identify factors predictive of sur￾vival. Overall survival was measured from the first dose
of rituximab until death or last contact, and event-free
survival from the first dose of rituximab to the date of
relapse, progression, death or last contact. 
Results
Patients 
A total of 38 patients with B-cell post-transplant lym￾phoproliferative disorders were assessable.
Immunosuppressive drug therapy was reduced in all
patients. Twenty-six (68%) patients were male. The
median age was 55 years (range 19-69). 
Histopathological findings
Histopathological findings are shown in Table 1. A
lymph node was obtained for diagnosis from 18 patients
(in 13 cases, a peripheral node and in 5, a node from the
abdomen by laparotomy). The diagnosis was made by
gastric biopsy in six cases, bone marrow biopsy in three
patients, and hepatic ileum biopsy in two patients. Six
cases were diagnosed from biopsies of other extra-nodal
tissue (small bowel in 2, breast in 1, lung in 1, paraverte￾bral mass in 1, and ascitic effusion in 1), and in three cases
the origin of the biopsy tissue was not reported. Seven
(18%) cases were considered to have polymorphic B-cell
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. All sam￾ples were CD20 positive.
Twenty tissue samples were assessed for EBV expres￾sion at diagnosis. LPM-1 and EBER were studied simulta￾neously in seven samples (4 were positive), only LPM-1
in five (4 were positive) and only EBER in eight (6 were
positive). Overall, 14 (70%) samples were positive for any
type of EBV expression. 
Clinical presentation
Data on the clinical presentation of the B-cell post￾transplant lymphoproliferative disorders are shown in
Table 2. The median time from transplant to the lympho￾proliferative disorder was 66.2 months (limits 2.2-202);
eight (21%) patients developed the disorder within 12
months after organ transplantation (early post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disorder). Twenty-two (61%) out of
36 patients had Ann Arbor stage III-IV disease. Twenty￾three (61%) had extranodal disease, six (15%) of them
with graft involvement. Seventeen (49%) out of 35
patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) ≥3.
Safety and efficacy
One episode of grade 4 neutropenia was the only acute
severe adverse event observed, and treatment was not
discontinued after recovery. Figure 1 shows the main
results of the study. After the first course of rituximab
therapy, 13 (34.2%) patients achieved CR, 17 PR and
eight did not respond (five patients who did not respond
did not complete the first four cycles of rituximab because
they progressed during treatment).
Among the eight patients who did not respond, five
died of progressive disease and three were treated with
chemotherapy combined with rituximab and are alive

without evidence of lymphoma.
Among the 17 patients in PR, five progressed before the
second course of rituximab could be administered, two
died of progressive disease and three were treated with
chemotherapy combined with rituximab (1 died of pro￾gression, 1 died of infection during chemotherapy and 1
is alive and free of lymphoma). The other 12 patients in
PR were treated with additional doses of rituximab, and
ten (83,3%) achieved CR. Two of these patients did not
complete the four additional cycles by protocol: one died
after six cycles due to hepatic abscesses without evidence
of lymphoma at autopsy and one patient was evaluated
after six cycles and treatment was stopped because he
had achieved CR. The two patients who did not achieve
CR after the second course of rituximab were treated
with chemotherapy combined with rituximab: one died
of progression and one is alive and free of disease. In an
intention-to-treat analysis, 23 (60.5%) patients achieved
CR with rituximab therapy (Table 3). Among the eight
patients excluded from the trial because of absence of CR
who were treated with chemotherapy, seven were treat￾ed with R-CHOP (two to eight cycles) and one with R￾EPOCH. Overall, six (75%) of these patients achieved CR.
With a median follow-up of 27.5 months, two patients
relapsed at 6.5 and 7 months after CR. One of them was
treated with chemotherapy and is alive and free of dis￾ease, and the other died of disease progression. During
this time period, 14 (36.8%) patients died. Ten (26.3%)
patients died of disease progression, three patients of
infection without evidence of post-transplant lymphopro￾liferative disease (1 of pneumonia, 1 of septic shock, and
1 of hepatic abscesses) and one patient suffered a cardiac
arrest of unknown cause. Figure 2 shows the overall sur￾vival curve.

Prognostic factors
We studied different factors that could be predictive of
CR: age, sex, organ transplanted, type of immunosup￾pression, monomorphic versus polymorphic B-cell post￾transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, EBV expression
in tissue, time between transplant and post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disease (early versus late), Ann
Arbour stage, bulky disease, graft involvement, extran￾odal disease, number of extranodal sites of disease, B
symptoms, ECOG score, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
and β2-microglobulin levels, IPI, hemoglobin concentra￾tion, leukocyte count, platelet count, albumin level, and
gammaglobulin level. None of the variables analyzed
showed a clinically relevant prognostic significance,
either for response or for survival. 
Discussion
The aim of this prospective clinical trial was to ana￾lyze the CR rate after treatment with extended doses of
rituximab in patients with B-cell post-transplant lym￾phoproliferative disorders following solid organ trans￾plantation. Patients with disseminated post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disorders who do not respond to
reduction of immunosuppression have been treated
with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but the
associated toxicity has been significant and included
treatment-related deaths in about 25% of patients,12,13
mainly due to organ dysfunction and infections resulting
from the immunosuppressive therapy. Several retrospec￾tive analyses have been conducted to demonstrate the
benefit of rituximab in patients with B-cell post-trans￾plant lymphoproliferative disorders.17,18 There are only,
however, two prospective studies of therapy with ritux￾imab in patients with B-cell post-transplant lymphopro￾liferative disorders after failure of reduction of immuno￾suppression. The first one was carried out in Germany
and included 17 patients,20 and the other was recently
published by a French group and included 43 patients.19
In both studies therapy consisted of four infusions of rit￾uximab at a standard dose. In our prospective study we
treated 38 patients with extended doses of rituximab
adapted to the previous response, to a maximum of
eight infusions. Over 34% of patients achieved CR after
four cycles of rituximab, and 26.3% more responded
after two to four additional cycles of rituximab for a
delayed CR rate of 60.5%. It is remarkable that ten
(83%) out of 12 patients who received a second course
of rituximab therapy achieved CR. In the trial published
by the French group, the CR rate after four doses of rit￾uximab was 28% at day 80 and 30% at day 360. This is
similar to our results, but in our trial, a large number of
patients in PR after the first four cycles achieved CR
with additional doses of rituximab. In our trial, eight
patients were treated with chemotherapy after ritux￾imab therapy, and six (75%) achieved CR with lower
toxicity than that usually described in the literature,12,13
probably because they were in fitter and had less tumor
disease than at diagnosis. 
Only two patients relapsed after CR. This is also in
accordance with the results of the French trial and indi￾cates that the main aim of the treatment for patients
with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders is to
reach CR. There are still patients who cannot complete
the first course of rituximab because their disease pro￾gresses very quickly, and who cannot be treated with
either more rituximab or chemotherapy. Pre-emptive
treatment would be the only way to manage these high￾risk patients. 
The selection of patients who could benefit from ini￾tial rituximab therapy is important. We did not find any
variable significantly related to prognosis. In the French
series,19 an elevated LDH level was the only factor pre￾dictive of a poor overall response. For the German
group,20 the presence of EBV in tissue and a shorter time
between transplantation and diagnosis of the lympho￾proliferative disorder were associated with better
response. Other prognostic factors for a better response
found in retrospective analyses were a good perform￾ance status and detection of EBV in tumor tissue.22
However, in our study, neither LDH nor other variables
classically related with prognosis in immunocompetent
patients, such as those included in the IPI or the EBV sta￾tus, were of prognostic significance.
The toxicity of rituximab therapy has been found to be
very low. We did not observe any graft rejection. Only
three patients died of infections, which is comparable
with outcomes in other trials and expected in this type of
immunocompromised population.21 One episode of grade
4 neutropenia was the only severe adverse event
observed. Neutropenia has been described in immuno￾competent patients treated with rituximab.23 It is usually
transitory and does not require suspension of treatment.

These results confirm that extended treatment with rit￾uximab can obtain a high rate of CR in patients with B￾cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after
solid organ transplantation without increasing toxicity,
and should be recommended as initial therapy. There is
still a subgroup of patients who do not respond. Pre-emp￾tive treatment for these high-risk patients should be
investigated.
