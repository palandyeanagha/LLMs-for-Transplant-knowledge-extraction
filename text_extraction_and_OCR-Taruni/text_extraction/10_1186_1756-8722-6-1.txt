Abstract
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a major mechanism of action of therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) such as cetuximab, rituximab and trastuzumab. Fc gamma receptors (FcgR) on human white
blood cells are an integral part of the ADCC pathway. Differential response to therapeutic mAbs has been reported
to correlate with specific polymorphisms in two of these genes: FCGR2A (H131R) and FCGR3A (V158F). These
polymorphisms are associated with differential affinity of the receptors for mAbs. This review critically examines the
current evidence for genotyping the corresponding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to predict response to
mAbs in patients with cancer.

Targeted therapy utilising monoclonal antibodies
Advances in our understanding of the molecular processes
involved in carcinogenesis have allowed the development
of drugs that target specific cellular processes in malignant
cells. The use of such targeted therapies has become wide￾spread in oncology. Due to this targeted approach, many
of the ubiquitous side-effects of conventional chemother￾apy, such as myelosuppression, are reduced or eliminated.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an important group
of targeted therapies which are directed against transmem￾brane proteins with extracellular domains. Several mAbs
have entered routine clinical practice: notable examples
include trastuzumab (HerceptinW), rituximab (MabtheraW/
RituxanW) and cetuximab (ErbituxW) (Table 1). Trastuzu￾mab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor
family member HER2 and is indicated as the standard of
care in HER2 over-expressing breast and gastric cancers.
Rituximab targets CD20 receptors expressed on most ma￾lignant B cells and is used as the standard treatment for
B-cell malignancies such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Cetuximab
targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
is used in KRAS-wild type, metastatic colorectal cancer.
It is desirable to avoid exposing patients to a costly
and potentially toxic treatment if they have a reduced
chance of response. Cancer patients are thus often tested
for specific biological markers (biomarkers) that have
been found in clinical trials to be predictive of response
to targeted agents. A typical example is HER2 amplifica￾tion which is used to select patients for trastuzumab
treatment. Another example is mutation of codon 12 of
the KRAS gene which identifies patients who are un￾likely to respond to cetuximab. While targeted agents do
not have the same side effect profile as conventional
chemotherapy, they do still cause side effects, some of
which can be severe [1].
The problem is that not all of those patients who are
predicted to respond will do so, even if the biomarker
predicts response. For example, only 25-30% of HER2
amplification-positive metastatic breast cancer patients
will respond to trastuzumab [2]. Therefore, there is a need
to identify and validate additional robust biomarkers of re￾sponse to therapy in cancer patients. Understanding the
mechanisms of action of mAbs is of critical importance. * Correspondence: dan.mellor@petermac.org 1

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and Fc gamma
receptors
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) has
been identified pre-clinically as an important mechanism
in the elimination of tumour cells. ADCC depends on the
bifunctional structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG) mole￾cules. Therapeutic mAbs are typically molecules of the IgG
class and comprise an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) that
engages the tumour cell antigen and a crystalline fragment
(Fc) that binds a Fc gamma receptor (FcgR) on an effector
cell such as a natural killer (NK) cell, monocyte, or macro￾phage (see Figure 1).
ADCC is initiated when the Fab and Fc portions of the
mAb engage both tumour cell antigen and an activating
FcgR, respectively, thus creating a bridge from the tumour
cell to the effector cell. Target cell recognition is then
coupled to a lytic attack on the target cell mounted by ef￾fector cells [3,4]. The importance of this interaction is
demonstrated by the lower anti-tumour activity of mAbs
in FcgR-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice [5].
ADCC is considered to be a major mode of action of many
therapeutic mAbs, including treatments for cancer [5-8].
There are three classes of FcgRs based on genetic
homology (FcgR1/CD64, FcgR2/CD32 and FcgR3/CD16)
[9,10]. Each type is encoded by specific genes located in
the same region of the long arm of chromosome 1.
There are several different closely related genes for each
FcgR which have different cell type-specific patterns of
expression [9]: FCGR1A, FCGR1B, FCGR1C; FCGR2A,
FCGR2B1, FCGR2B2, FCGR2B3, FCGR2C; FCGR3A and
FCGR3B.
Even though the importance of ADCC is recognised
[11], other FcgR-mediated processes contribute to adaptive
cellular immunity. While NK cells express FcgR3a rather
than FcgR2a, antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells,
macrophages and B cells express both FcgR2a and FcgR3a.
Antigen presenting cells use FcgR-mediated endocytosis of
immune complexes and phagocytosis of antibody-coated
tumour cells as efficient means of tumour antigen proces￾sing and presentation, which can result in tumour-directed
T-cell immunity [12]. The clinical significance of ‘vaccine￾like, and presumably FcgR-mediated, effects of therapeutic ’
mAbs is increasingly recognised [13,14].
FcgR polymorphisms
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single base
changes in a gene that occur at a significant frequency
(often defined as more than 1%) in a population. SNPs in
the coding region of a gene often result in amino acid
changes that may alter the functioning of the affected pro￾teins. Certain SNPs in the coding regions of the FCGR2A
and FCGR3A genes appear to have clinical significance as
they have been reported to correlate with responses to
therapeutic mAbs and these form the principal subject of
this review.
A coding polymorphism in the extracellular domain of
FCGR2A has been described where a C>T substitution
(denoted as rs1801274) changes the amino acid at pos￾ition 131 from histidine to arginine [15]. This poly￾morphism is conveniently described by its amino acid
change His131Arg (H131R using the one letter amino
acid nomenclature). The FCGR2A receptor binds to dif￾ferent classes of IgGs, with highest affinity for human
IgG1 and IgG3 [2]. Position 131 is polymorphic for bind￾ing of human IgG2 but not of human IgG1, with the
H131 allelic form of FcgR2a seeming to be the only class
of FcgR that interacts well with IgG2 [15].
A second important FcgR coding polymorphism occurs
in extracellular domain 2 of FCGR3A. A T>G substitution
changes valine to phenylalanine at position 158 (Val158Phe
or V158F) [16,17]. This polymorphism (rs396991) is occa￾sionally denoted in the literature as V176F [16] (and once
as FCGR3A 818A>C ! [18]). The residue at position 158
directly interacts with the lower hinge region of IgG1
[19,20].

the strongest response [21]. An important role for the
FcgR phenotype is indicated by the observation that NK
cells from donors homozygous for FCGR3A 158 V (V/V)
bound more IgG1 compared with cells from donors who
were homozygous for FCGR3A 158 F (F/F) [16,17]. Here,
we review pre-clinical and clinical data concerning the
effects of FcgR polymorphisms on the activity of some
widely used therapeutic mAbs which all belong to the
IgG1 isotype.
Pre-clinical and clinical studies
Trastuzumab
Trastuzumab is a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 mAb effect￾ive in treating breast and gastric cancers which overexpress
HER2. However, only 25%-30% of patients with metastatic
HER2-positive breast cancers will respond to trastuzumab
[2] and only 30% of HER2-positive patients treated with
neoadjuvant trastuzumab will achieve a complete patho￾logical response [22]. In addition, between 2-5% of patients
will suffer from clinical cardiac dysfunction as a side effect
of trastuzumab therapy [20]. Thus identifying biomarkers
that will predict the response to trastuzumab is desirable.
As part of the response to trastuzumab may be due to
ADCC [2], FcgR polymorphisms are potential biomarkers
of response.
In a pre-clinical study, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC of
autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs)
was measured by a chromium-51 release assay using
a HER2-positive human breast cancer cell line (MDA￾MB-361) as a target. The ADCC analysis showed that
PBMNCs of FCGR2A H/H and/or FCGR3A V/V geno￾types caused significantly higher trastuzumab mediated
cytotoxicity than PBMNCs of other genotypes [2].
A retrospective, non-randomised study of trastuzumab
in 54 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast can￾cer found a significant difference in the objective re￾sponse rate depending on the FCGR2A and FCGR3A
genotypes [2]. Patients were treated with trastuzumab
plus a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) with a contempor￾aneous population of patients receiving single-agent tax￾ane serving as controls. Patients who had FCGR2A
131 H/H and/or FCGR3A 158 V/V genotypes had a sig￾nificantly better objective response rate and progression
free survival (PFS) with trastuzumab therapy than patients
with neither genotype (the PFS estimates were 30.3 and
12.8 months respectively; p = 0.01). A multivariate analysis
led the authors to conclude that the combination of the
two favorable FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes was an in￾dependent predictive factor of response [2].
Another retrospective, non-randomised study examined
the effect of the FcgR polymorphisms on trastuzumab effi￾cacy in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic HER2-
positive breast cancer settings [22]. The neoadjuvant
group consisted of 15 patients who received doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel and
trastuzumab. Thirty-five patients in the metastatic group
received weekly single-agent trastuzumab until disease
progression. They reported that the FCGR2A 131 H/H
genotype significantly correlated with pathological re￾sponse in the neoadjuvant group (71% for H/H vs 0% for
H/R and R/R; p = 0.015). The FCGR3A 158 V/V genotype
was found not to correlate with response. In the metastatic
group, a significant difference in objective response rate
was observed between the FCGR2A 131 H/H patients and
the H/R or R/R patients (p = 0.043). A non-statistically sig￾nificant trend was reported in FCGR3A 158 V/V patients
showing an overall higher response rate than V/F or F/F
patients (40% for V/V vs 10% for F/V and F/F p = 0.053).
The PFS of FCGR2A 131 H/H patients was found to be
significantly longer than that of H/R or R/R patients
(9.2 months vs 3.5 months, p = 0.034). In contrast, no sta￾tistically significant difference in the PFS of FCGR3A
158 V/V patients compared with V/F or F/F patients was
observed (8.5 months vs 5.3 months, p = 0.37).
The largest study to date examining the effects of FcgR
polymorphisms on the response to trastuzumab is that
of Hurvitz et al. [23]. The patients were part of the
Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG)-
006 study of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab
with chemotherapy for HER2-positive early stage breast
cancer. BCIRG-006 was a randomized clinical trial in
which two trastuzumab containing experimental arms
(both using the same dose of trastuzumab – 8 mg/kg load￾ing does followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for a total of
12 months) were compared to a non-trastuzumab control
arm. Germline DNA from 1218 patients and 1189 patients
was genotyped for the H131R and V158F SNPs, respect￾ively. There was no statistically significant difference in dis￾ease free survival (DFS) based on FcgR genotypes (FCGR2A
H/H vs H/R vs R/R, log rank test, p = 0.81, and FCGR3A
V/V vs V/F vs F/F, log rank test, p = 0.33). Interestingly, in
the trastuzumab arms, there was no statistically sig￾nificant difference in DFS by FCGR2A (p = 0.76) or
FCGR3A (p = 0.98) genotype. Furthermore, when a sub￾analysis of the genotypes previously found to have been
favorable by Musolino et al. [2] (FCGR2A H/H and
FCGR3A V/V) compared to the other genotypes was per￾formed, once again there was no statistically significant
difference in DFS (p = 0.67). Hurvitz et al. also looked at a
53 patient cohort of metastatic breast cancer patients who
also did not show a difference in PFS according to FcgR
genotype. The authors concluded that FCGR2A H131R
and FCGR3A V158F genotype did not correlate with tras￾tuzumab efficacy in HER2-positive breast cancer.
Although the two small, underpowered, retrospective
and non-randomised studies [2,22] show that FcgR poly￾morphisms are associated with anti-tumour efficacy of
trastuzumab, the well powered analysis of Hurvitz et al.
Mellor et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2013, 6:1 Page 3 of 10
http://www.jhoonline.org/content/6/1/1

[23] indicates that FcgR polymorphisms are not useful as
predictive biomarkers of trastuzumab response in HER2-
positive breast cancer, particularly in early stage disease.
However, the patients analysed by Hurvitz show a major
departure from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for FCGR3A
but not for FCGR2A. The FCGR3A heterozygotes were
under-represented indicating that there probably was an
admixture of multiple ethnicities (Table 2). Moreover, in
the subset of adjuvant patients genotyped in the study (N =
1,286), the trastuzumab benefit appeared to be non￾statistically significant, unlike that seen in the overall
BCIRG-006 trial population (N = 3,222).
Rituximab
A number of antibodies have been developed against the
CD20 antigen which is widely expressed in B-cell malig￾nancies, of which the chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 mAb ritux￾imab is the most widely used [24]. Rituximab, has proved
to be a highly effective treatment for non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and CLL.
An in vitro study by Dall’Ozzo et al. reported that the
concentration of rituximab needed for 50% lysis (EC50) of
a Burkitt lymphoma cell line by natural killer (NK) cells
from healthy donors who had the FCGR3A 158 V/V geno￾type was 4.2 times lower than that observed with NK cells
from donors who had FCGR3A 158 F/F [25]. However, this
was only seen at very low concentrations of rituximab,
much lower than those observed in vivo with normal dos￾ing schedules, and a differential was not seen at higher
concentrations [26,27]. Moreover, for a given concentra￾tion of a therapeutic mAb such as rituximab, the interplay
between multiple factors may determine its anti-tumour
activity in vivo. For example, at clinically relevant rituxi￾mab concentrations in vitro, serum complement sup￾pressed the induction of target cell death by ADCC and
most markedly in effector cells that carried the 158 F/F
genotype [28].
A beneficial effect of the FCGR3A 158 V/V genotype
was reported by Cartron et al. in a study of 49 patients
who had received rituximab for follicular lymphoma
[29]. FCGR3A 158 V/V patients, who accounted for one
fifth of the study population, had an improved response,
with 100% and 90% objective response rates at 2 months
and 12 months, respectively, compared with 2 month
and 12 month response rates of 67% (p = 0.03) and 51%
(p = 0.03) respectively, in FCGR3A 158 F carriers. How￾ever, there was no statistically significant difference in
PFS although a trend was observed.
In a study of 87 patients with follicular lymphoma
who had been treated with rituximab [30], FCGR3A
158 V/V patients also showed a higher response rate to
rituximab treatment. This study found significant differ￾ences in PFS at 2 years: 45% for patients who were
FCGR3A 158 V/V, and 14% for patient who were either
FCGR3A 158 V/F or F/F (12% for V/F, 16% for F/F).
Patients homozygous for the V allele of FCGR3A showed
a higher response rate to rituximab treatment [30].
A retrospective study of patients with follicular lymph￾oma treated with rituximab in combination with chemo￾therapy found that overall survival was improved in
patients with the FCGR3A 158 V/V genotype [31]. DNA
from 142 patients was extracted from tissue preserved in
paraffin blocks. It should be noted the FCGR3A genotype
could not be determined in 22 patients. The authors con￾cluded that patients with at least one FCGR3A V allele was
associated with improved overall survival versus the F/F
genotype (HR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.11, 0.96, p = 0.042). Further￾more, for overall survival, there was evidence of a statistical
interaction between the use of rituximab and the number of
FCGR3A V alleles present (0, 1, or 2) (p = 0.006). Differences
in the FCGR2A genotype were not found to correlate with
outcome [31].
In patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Kim
et al. reported that the FCGR3A 158 V allele was asso￾ciated with a significantly higher complete response rate
to a combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxo￾rubicin and prednisolone [32].
Not all studies show a significant correlation between
FcgR SNPs and clinical response to rituximab therapy.
Dornan et al. assessed the progression free survival in a
retrospective study of 419 CLL patients receiving fludar￾abine and cyclophosphamide or FC plus rituximab [33].
They concluded that FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorph￾isms did not significantly influence response rate and
PFS in either treatment arm.
The recent PRIMA study reported that FCGR2A and
FCGR3A polymorphisms do not influence the response
rate and outcome of follicular lymphoma patients trea￾ted with rituximab, either when it is combined with
chemotherapy or used as maintenance treatment [26].
The analysis used peripheral blood DNA from 460
patients out of 1217 patients enrolled in this open-label,
randomised clinical trial. Patients received one of three
possible induction therapies containing rituximab in
combination with a chemotherapy regimen. Following
induction treatment; patients who achieved a complete
response, or a partial response were randomly assigned
(ratio 1:1) to observation or rituximab maintenance
treatment. The authors reported complete responses
after induction therapy in 65%, 67%, 66% (p = 0.86) of
FCGR3A with the VV, VF, FF genotypes, and 60%, 73%,
66% (p = 0.21) of FCGR2A with the HH, HR, RR geno￾types, respectively. After 2 years of maintenance therapy,
response rates or PFS were not found to be influenced
by FcgR genotype. However, the authors did report that
FCGR3A polymorphisms were associated with the rate
of grade 3–4 neutropenia during induction therapy con￾sistent with previous reports that immune mechanisms

mediated by NK cells may play a role in rituximab￾induced neutropenia [34]. Two previous small retro￾spective studies of rituximab in follicular lymphoma
patients also did not report any correlation between
FCGR2A or 3A polymorphisms and outcome [35,36].
In conclusion, although several small studies in lymph￾oma have shown that FcgR polymorphisms may be useful
in predicting response to single agent rituximab [29,30,32]
and have all shown the same favorable genotype, none of
the analyses showed a statistically different PFS based on
FcgR genotype. The larger studies examining the effects of
FcgR polymorphisms on the outcome of follicular
lymphoma and CLL patients treated with rituximab com￾bined with chemotherapy showed no association between
FcgR genotype and either response rate or outcome
[26,33].
Cetuximab
Cetuximab is a chimeric IgG1 mAb directed to the extra￾cellular domain of the EGFR which is expressed at high
levels in many epithelial tumours. It has been approved to

A retrospective study in metastatic colorectal cancer
patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan found that
patients with the homozygous FCGR2A 131 H/H and/or
FCGR3A 158 V/V genotypes had a longer PFS than
patients who carried a 131 R allele or a 158 F allele
(5.5 months vs 3.0 months p = 0.005) [37]. The analysis
included 69 patients who had all received and progressed
through one irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regi￾men. The majority of patients had actually received two￾lines of prior therapy. Bibeau et al. concluded that when
combined, FCGR2A/FCGR3A genotypes are prognostic
factors for disease progression in metastatic colorectal
cancer patients treated with the combination of cetuximab
and irinotecan [37]. A reservation about these data is that
there is deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
indicative of methodological problems (Table 2).
In a study of 106 patients with metastatic colorectal can￾cer who had been treated with cetuximab and standard
chemotherapy (only defined as irinotecan or oxaliplatin￾based), Rodriguez et al. reported that patients with any
FCGR2A 131H and/or FCGR3A 158 V allele were more
likely to show a response or have stable disease (65% vs
35% for other genotypes; p = 0.014). The study recruit￾ment occurred prior to the routine pre-selection of
patients for cetuximab treatment on the basis of KRAS
mutation status. The authors state that the presence of
KRAS mutations only accounted for 30-40% of patients
who do not respond to cetuximab. Furthermore, they
summarised literature that reported patients with KRAS
mutant tumours who still responded to cetuximab [38].
On this basis, they wanted to determine if FcgR genotype
would predict which patients with a KRAS, or other down￾stream mutations, would respond to cetuximab. Thus,
only 44 patients who were later found to have either a
KRAS, BRAF, NRAS or PI3K mutation were included in
the FcgR genotype analysis [39]. Somewhat surprisingly,
these selection criteria resulted in patients whose tumours
were KRAS wild type and thus who might reasonably be
expected to respond to cetuximab [40] being excluded
from the analysis.
Etienne-Grimaldi et al. examined the effect of FCGR2A
H131R and FCGR3A V158F SNPs on the efficacy of cetuxi￾mab in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with
cetuximab and irinotecan in combination with oral tegafur￾uracil [41]. Germline DNA samples from 52 patients were
available for FcgR genotyping. A non-significant trend to￾wards a better response rate was observed in FCGR3A
158 V-carriers (62.1% in V/V or V/F patients vs 26.3% in
F/F; p = 0.020, where a multiple comparisons test set the
level of statistical significance at less than or equal to
0.010). A longer, although non-statistically significant, over￾all survival was also reported in FCGR3A 158 V-carriers
(20.9 months for V/V or V/F patients vs 12.4 months for
F/F; p = 0.032).
In contrast, a study in metastatic colorectal cancer
patients treated with cetuximab found that FCGR3A
158 V/V patients had a shorter PFS compared with 158
V/F or F/F patients [42]. The analysis included 39 patients
who were part of the phase II open-label multicenter study
(ImClone trial 0144) of cetuximab. Genotyping was per￾formed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood.
A combined analysis of the FCGR2A 131 and FCGR3A
158 polymorphisms showed that patients with the favor￾able genotypes found in this study (FCGR2A, any H al￾lele, and FCGR3A, any F allele) showed a median PFS of
3.7 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4 months), whereas patients
with any two unfavorable genotypes (FCGR2A 131 R/R
or FCGR3A 158 V/V) had a PFS of 1.1 months (95% CI,
1.0 to 1.4 months; p = 0.004 )[42]. The results of this
study have been supported by a randomised phase II
clinical trial examining the use of cetuximab in combin￾ation with bevacizumab in irinotecan-refractory colorec￾tal cancer patients (the BOND-2 study) [43]. It showed
that FCGR3A 158 F/F patients had a significantly better
response to the combination therapy compared to
patients who were F/V or V/V (n = 31, response rates of
56%, 25% and 8% respectively). However, there are some
concerns regarding the significant deviation from Hardy￾Weinberg equilibrium in this study (Table 2).
More recently a diminished survival for patients with the
FCGR3A 158 V/V genotype (as compared to V/F or F/F)
has also been demonstrated by Dahan et al. in a study of 58
patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had received
irinotecan in combination with cetuximab [44]. This effect
was present in the entire study population and in a sub￾analysis of patients with KRAS wild type tumours. The
authors concluded that the FCGR3A V158F polymorphism
is a significant independent predictor of overall survival.
However, a retrospective analysis published by Paez et al.
concluded that FcgR genotype was not useful in predicting
response to cetuximab or panitumumab (an anti-EGFR
mAb) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer [45].
The study included 104 patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer who were treated with either cetuximab or pani￾tumumab after progressing through at least one prior
chemotherapy regimen. Overall, 92 patients (88%) were
treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy and 12 patients
(12%) were treated with panitumumab alone or in com￾bination with irinotecan. No significant difference was
observed for tumor response and PFS between FCGR2A or
FCGR3A genotype subsets. This remained the case regard￾less of KRAS status. The authors concluded that the only
reliable biomarkers to predict response to anti-EGFR ther￾apies are KRAS status and the presence of skin toxicity.
In summary, the data to support the use of FCGR2A
and FCGR3A polymorphisms to predict the response to
cetuximab are inconsistent. Three retrospective studies re￾port that the V/V genotype is the most beneficial FCGR3A
Mellor et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2013, 6:1 Page 7 of 10
http://www.jhoonline.org/content/6/1/1

genotype [37,39,41], whereas three other retrospective
studies report that the F/F genotype is the most beneficial
[42-44]. The inconsistent findings suggest that FcgR poly￾morphisms are not currently useful predictive biomarkers
of response to cetuximab.
Methodological considerations for FcgR genotyping
The inconsistent relationship between FCGR3A genotype
and indicators of clinical benefit precludes the use of FcgR
polymorphisms as predictive markers of response to
monoclonal antibodies in cancer patients. Although the
reason for these discordant findings remains unclear,
methodological factors may be of critical importance.
Differences in the tissues used or flaws in methodology may
account for some of the discrepancies between the various
clinical studies. Methodological flaws may sometimes be
responsible when significant deviations from the Hardy￾Weinberg equilibrium are seen. This section will briefly
review the issues relevant to FcgR genotyping studies.
The source of tissue for FcgR genotyping is an import￾ant consideration. Ideally, normal tissue should be used
for genotyping as the germline genotype determines the
phenotype of the cytotoxic T-cells which mediate ADCC.
However, in some studies, only surgically removed tumour
material will be available. Tumour DNA may have under￾gone allelic loss (also known as loss of heterozygosity:
LOH) and thus may not enable accurate genotyping in
some cases. Adjacent normal tissue can often be insuffi￾cient for DNA extraction and may not be truly normal.
Attempting to genotype using formalin fixed paraffin em￾bedded (FFPE) samples adds another level of complexity
due to the fragmentation and degradation of the DNA.
However, even if good quality DNA from peripheral
blood is used, accurate genotyping of the FCGR3A V58F
polymorphism is methodologically challenging because of
the very high degree of sequence homology between
FCGR3A and FCGR3B. These two genes are more than
99% homologous in the region flanking the V158F po￾lymorphism thus placing constraints on the design of
FCGR3A -specific PCR primers. To amplify FCGR3A pre￾ferentially and to minimize amplification of FCGR3B, it is
necessary to discriminate against FCGR3B by placing the 3’
end of the primer at one of the very few places where the
sequence of FCGR3B is different from FCGR3A. (In several
reports, a nested PCR approach was used. In our opinion,
nested PCRs should be used with caution because of the
very real danger of inadvertent PCR contamination.)
Methods that do not sufficiently discriminate against the
pseudogene which has a G at the position corresponding
to the rs396991 SNP will lead to an overcalling of hetero￾zygotes and a corresponding undercalling of TT hom￾ozygotes. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis may be
used to determine whether this might be occurring for a
given methodology. Deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium may also occur in large multicentre studies
where diverse ethnic groups are represented but in this
case, a preponderance of homozygotes might be expected
if the populations differ in allelic frequency. Table 2 shows
the fit with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the studies
where individual genotype frequencies are reported and
indicates that several deviate from expectations.
The opportunities for PCR primer design are limited
further if an FFPE tumour sample is used because the
highly fragmented DNA obtained from FFPE makes it
necessary to design short amplicons flanking the diag￾nostic SNP. In the case of FCGR3A, if only (FFPE)
tumour tissue is available, the best methodology is one
that is sensitive to the presence of both alleles, even if
one is present at low frequency due to LOH. To favour
specific amplification from FCGR3A, we have recently
adopted a Pyrosequencing approach as this allows the
determination of allelic frequency even when one of the
alleles is present at less than 10% (Mellor, Mikeska and
Dobrovic; manuscript in preparation).
Conclusions
The functional FcgR polymorphisms have been reported
as novel pharmacogenetic biomarkers that could be used
to better target the use of mAbs in cancer patients.
However, the studies that we have reviewed do not de￾scribe a consistent effect of FcgR genotype on the clin￾ical anti-tumour activity of therapeutic mAbs of IgG1
isotype. The inconsistencies found in these studies in￾clude the tumour type, the cytotoxic agents used in
combination, the clinical setting (metastatic vs adjuvant
for trastuzumab), the clinical benefit parameters mea￾sured, the therapeutic antibody used, as well as the mag￾nitude and even the direction of the effect. Even when
there was agreement between studies about the most
beneficial genotype, subgroups of patients with less fa￾vorable genotypes still appeared to derive some treat￾ment benefit from mAb therapy.
Many of the studies presented here were retrospective
and non-randomised and cannot adequately determine
the nature of the relationship of host FcgR genotype to
the anti-tumour activity of the mAbs. Significantly, sev￾eral well-powered studies did not support the hypothesis
that FcgR genotype predicts the therapeutic effect of
these agents.
Although FcgR genotype may be a factor contribut￾ing to both the anti-tumour activity and clinical
benefit of these therapeutic mAbs, other factors may
also be important.
(i) The FCGR2A H131R and FCGR3A V158F
polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium and
their contributions may be difficult to disentangle
[46,47].
Mellor et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2013, 6:1 Page 8 of 10
http://www.jhoonline.org/content/6/1/1

(ii) Direct cytotoxicity of the mAbs, which depends on
Fab binding rather than Fc binding and which is
enhanced by the chemo- and radio-sensitizing
properties of these mAbs;
(iii)Predominance of non-ADCC mechanisms of action,
including complement-dependent cytotoxicity,
apoptosis and phagocytosis
(iv)Pharmacokinetic properties of the mAbs such as the
maximum concentration achieved in relation to
antigenic mass [48];
(v) Fab-mediated tumour cell cytotoxicity and FcgR￾mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis of tumour
antigens that together initiate cellular immunity,
which may be slow in onset and durable [12,49];
Standardising methodologies for accurate genotyping
is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
We also need to await the outcomes of more large trials
using robust testing methodologies before we can reach
a definitive conclusion about the predictive utility of
FcgR polymorphisms. However, even a significant differ￾ence in tumour response based on FcgR genotype can￾not reasonably be used to exclude patients from mAb
therapy if the distinct possibility of a tumour response
remains. Hence, we consider that it is currently not clin￾ically appropriate to deny mAb therapies to patients on
the basis of their FcgR genotype.
