Abstract. Cancer growth, metastasis and development are 
regulated by a number of genes, whose expression mediates 
important processes, including cellular plasticity, motility 
and internal interactions in the tumor microenvironment. 
The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) serves an 
important role in cell‑cell migration and tumorigenicity, 
particularly metastasis. The aim of the present study was to 
measure EpCAM expression using immunohistochemistry 
and to investigate the association between clinicopathological 
features and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 
results revealed that EpCAM expression may be a biomarker 
for poor prognosis in patients with HCC and may therefore be 
used to predict clinical outcome. The present study suggests 
that EpCAM expression in HCC can be considered as a routine 
biomarker for unfavorable prognosis and may provide a basis 
for the future development of anti‑EpCAM‑targeted therapy.
Introduction
In Taiwan, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second‑most 
common cause of cancer‑associated mortality and its incidence 
is increasing (1). A number of risk factors for HCC have been 
reported previously, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholic 
liver disease and non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (2‑4). In 2016, 
the reported outcome of HCC was poor, with a high mortality 
rate (35.5/100,000) in Taiwan (5). Current targeted and systemic 
therapies for HCC face a number of challenges, including drug 
toxicity and resistance (6). As such, the development of effective 
prediction and surveillance tools are necessary to enable early 
diagnosis, the prediction of clinical outcomes and personalized 
adjuvant treatments (7). Recent studies on HCC have focused on 
the development of high‑throughput microarrays for predicting 
HCC prognosis (8‑10). Several genes and proteins have been 
reported to be associated with HCC prognosis, including 
forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) (10), cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 
(Cdk1) (9), TP53BP1 and CDKN1B (8).
Typically, tumor progression occurs in two stages: Growth 
and distant metastases. Circulating tumor cells spread from 
the primary sites into the peripheral blood supply and arrive 
at the metastasis site; this process involves many genes (11,12). 
Recurrent, high‑grade and distant metastases indicate invasive 
circulating tumor cells, which are responsible for poor prognosis 
in HCC patients (13). A transmembrane glycoprotein‑epithelial 
cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM; CD326) serves an impor￾tant role in the distant metastasis of HCC (14). Ber‑EP4 is 
a monoclonal antibody that effectively labels EpCAM in 
epithelial tissues and has been widely used to differentiate 
mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma and basal and squamous cell 
carcinomas (15,16). However, few studies have analyzed the 
association between EpCAM expression and HCC prognosis. 
The aim of the present study was to analyze tumor and normal 
tissue samples from Taiwanese patients with HCC who had not 
previously received chemotherapy or targeted therapy in order 
to determine whether EpCAM expression is an independent 
clinicopathological indicator of HCC.

between July 2011 and November 2013 at the Division 
of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Changhua 
Christian Hospital, Taiwan. The present study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of Changhua Christian 
Hospital (CCH IRB number: 120504). Informed consent was 
obtained from all included patients. The inclusion criteria 
were as follows: HCC diagnosis, no previous chemotherapy 
or targeted therapies. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 
Age <18 years, pregnancy, previous chemotherapy, targeted 
therapy, or surgical intervention. All included patients received 
curative surgical treatment and long‑term follow‑up. The 
demographic and clinical data, including pathological stage, 
operative procedure and surgical outcome, were recorded 
and patients were monitored until death, censorship, or loss 
to follow‑up. The Child‑Pugh score predicted the clinical 
outcome. Following surgical resection, primary tumor tissues 
and matched adjacent normal tissues were collected and 
analyzed using a tissue microarray. The follow‑up duration was 
defined as the period between the date of surgical intervention 
to the date of last visit or death. Patients were categorized into 
the low expression and high expression groups depending on 
EpCAM expression. The median EpCAM expression in the 
tumor group was used as the cut off value.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scoring. To detect EpCAM 
expression, tumor specimens were embedded in paraffin, cut 
into 4‑µm‑thick sections and mounted on poly‑l‑lysine‑coated 
slides. Subsequently, 10 mM Tris‑HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM 
sodium chloride were used to deparaffinize and rinse slides. 
Tissue was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 
room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X‑100 for 
10 min at room temperature, blocked with 3% bovine serum 
albumin (Sigma‑Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) 
for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with EpCAM 
(Ber‑EP4) monoclonal antibodies (cat. no. 61‑0132‑2; 1:100; 
Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) 
in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were 
washed thrice with PBS and antibodies were detected using the 
EnVision Detection Systems Peroxidase/DAB, Rabbit/Mouse 
kit (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) 
and observed under a light microscope (BX50; Olympus Corp., 
Tokyo, Japan) at a magnification of x20 and x40. EpCAM 
expression was visualized in negative controls (adjacent normal 
tissues) by performing the same IHC steps, excluding the addi￾tion of the monoclonal antibodies. IHC results were evaluated 
by a professional pathologist and the scoring system considered 
two aspects: Staining intensity and percentage of positive cells. 
The staining intensity was scored using 4 grades as described 
previously (17,18): 0, no expression; 1, weak expression; 2, 
moderate expression; and 3, strong expression. The IHC score 
ranged from 0 to 300 and was calculated using the following 
formula: Staining intensity x percentage of positive labeled cells.
Statistical analysis. The association between EpCAM expres￾sion and the clinical and pathological parameters was analyzed 
using Chi‑square and paired‑sample t‑tests. SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. 
Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan‑Meier method 
and compared using log‑rank test. Cox's proportional hazards 
regression model was used to analyze the association between 
the variables and survival data. P<0.05 was considered to 
indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Patient characteristics. Patient characteristics are listed in 
Table I. A total of 185 patients (aged 26‑81 years; mean, 
62.9±10.8 years; male: Female, 73:27) were included in the 
present study. The majority of patients had Child‑Pugh score 
A (Child‑Pugh points: 4.79±1.8), with a mean tumor size of 
45.9 mm. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C was 54.6 and 
33.5%, respectively. Following surgical excision, pathology 
revealed moderately differentiated tumors in most patients 
(n=97; 52.4%) and well‑differentiated tumors in 12 patients 
(6.5%), with poorly differentiated tumors in 76 patients (41.1%). 
A total of 143 patients (76.4%) were determined to have HCC at 
clinical stage I. The mean follow‑up time was 857 days. During 
this period, 20 (10.8%) patients experienced tumor recurrence.
EpCAM expression. IHC staining revealed that all 185 HCC 
and normal adjacent tissues were positive for EpCAM expres￾sion. EpCAM expression was upregulated in tumor tissues 
compared with matched adjacent normal liver tissues (Fig. 1A). 
In addition, EpCAM expression was significantly higher in 
HCC tissues compared with the paired adjacent normal liver 
tissues (P<0.001; Fig. 1B). The authors of the current study 
hypothesized that high EpCAM expression promotes poor 
clinical outcomes in the low‑expression group. Among the 
clinicopathological parameters assessed, the differentiation 
grade was positively associated with high EpCAM expression 
(P<0.05; Table II). No significant association was observed 
between high EpCAM expression and hepatitis B or C.

time was 832 days in the group with high EpCAM expres￾sion (survival rate, 80%) and 976 days in the group with low 
EpCAM expression (survival rate, 90%).
The association between high EpCAM expression 
and clinical outcomes in HCC patients was investigated 
(Table II). Overall survival analysis revealed that patients 
with a high clinical stage and high EpCAM expression had 
lower survival rates and reduced survival duration, compared 
with those at clinical stages III and IV, and low EpCAM 
expression. Cox regression analysis confirmed the prog￾nostic significance of a high clinical stage and high EpCAM 
expression (Table IV). Kaplan‑Meier analysis revealed that 
patients with high EpCAM expression had a shorter overall 
survival time compared with those with low EpCAM expres￾sion (Fig. 2A); similar results were noted for high clinical 
stage and differentiation grade in patients with HCC (Fig. 2). 
These results suggest that high EpCAM expression serves 
an important role in determining the clinical outcomes of 
patients with HCC.
Discussion
EpCAM is a transmembrane glycoprotein that regu￾lates Ca2+‑independent cell‑cell adhesion via several 
functions, including cell migration, proliferation and differen￾tiation (19‑21). In addition, EpCAM is involved in c‑Myc‑ and 
cyclin A/E‑mediated cell cycle progression and prolifera￾tion (22). High EpCAM expression has been reported to be 
regulated by Wnt/β‑catenin signaling, which is responsible 
for the tumorigenic and invasive abilities of HCC (23). High 
EpCAM expression is reportedly associated with poor clinical 
outcomes in breast (24), ovarian (25) and esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (26). Furthermore, Schmelzer et al (27) has 
proposed EpCAM as a hepatic stemness marker. Together, 
these reports suggest that EpCAM may be a good marker for 
HCC prognosis.
In the present study, EpCAM expression in primary 
HCC was investigated, as well as its impact on clinical 
outcomes. The results revealed that high EpCAM expression 
was significantly associated with high differentiation grade. 
Bae et al (28) previously reported that high EpCAM expres￾sion was associated with high histologic grade, while EpCAM 
downregulation inhibited HCC proliferation. These findings 
support the results of the present study, which indicate that 
high EpCAM expression is associated with high differentia￾tion grade and poor outcome. EpCAM immunoreactivity has 
been reported in 15.6‑35% of HCCs (29‑31) and is associated 
with young age, poor differentiation grade and high clinical 
stage (28,30,32,33). In the present study, EpCAM expres￾sion was significantly associated with differentiation grade; 
however, a high proportion of patients enrolled in the present 
study had stage I tumors (76.4%) compared with previous 
studies (28,34,35). Furthermore, no significant association 
was observed between EpCAM expression and clinical stage. 
However, Kaplan‑Meier analysis demonstrated that EpCAM 
serves an important role in patients with tumors of high clinical 
stage. With regards to long‑term patient follow‑up, EpCAM 
expression was not significant in multivariate analysis.
The carrier rate of hepatitis B and C in Taiwan is high 
and these viruses induce rapid development of HCC (36). A 
number of oncogenes and DNA micromutations, including 
WNT, β‑catenin, p53, Janus kinase, signal transducer and 
activator of transcription and mitogen‑activated protein 
kinase‑1, have been investigated in the progression and

development of hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with hepa￾titis B and C (37‑39). However, few studies have investigated 
the novel biomarker EpCAM. Kimura et al (40) reported that 
high EpCAM expression is frequently observed in patients 
with hepatitis B virus. In addition, they demonstrated that 
EpCAM‑expressing cells have high anti‑cancer drug resis￾tance. This trend was not observed in the present study. 
Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in 
overall survival analysis and Kaplan‑Meier analysis. This 
may be due to a number of reasons; firstly, the patient sample 
was small and the effects of high‑expression of EpCAM may 
not have been accurately detected. Secondly, a larger number 
of patients with stage I and II tumors were included in the 
present study compared with previous studies (28,34,41). 
Previous studies have reported that EpCAM expression 
is more significantly associated with clinical outcome in 
high‑stage tumors (28,34,41). Thirdly, liver cirrhosis rates 
and Child‑Pugh score were lower in in the present study 
compared with previous reports (28,34,41). Although no 
association was observed between high EpCAM expression 
and poor clinical outcome in HCC patients with hepatitis B 
and C virus infection in the present study, we believe that 
such association may exist. Further studies are required to 
confirm the role of high EpCAM expression in HCC. The 
authors of the present study also believe that high EpCAM 
expression may be associated with poor prognosis in HCC. 
Thus, high EpCAM expression may be a prognostic factor of 
poor outcome in patients with HCC.
In conclusion, the present study suggests a potential role 
of EpCAM as an important risk factor for poor survival in 
HCC and EpCAM expression can be measured using routine 
IHC. Further studies are required to investigate EpCAM as a 
biomarker for HCC. The preliminary data herein suggests that 
HCC patients with high EpCAM expression may benefit from
