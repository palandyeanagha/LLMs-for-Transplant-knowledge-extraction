Abstract
Previous studies have indicated that Il21r2/2 mice chronically infected with Toxoplasma gondii display a defect in serum IgG;
however, the basis for this antibody defect was not defined and questions remain about the role of IL-21 in promoting the
production of IL-10, which is required to limit infection-induced pathology during toxoplasmosis. Therefore, Il212/2 mice
were challenged with T. gondii to determine whether IL-21 impacts the parasite-specific CD8+ T cell response, its
contribution to thymus-dependent antibody production after infection, and balance between protective and pathogenic
responses. Whereas IL-21 has been implicated in the differentiation of IL-10 producing CD4+ T cells no immune-mediated
pathology was evident in Il212/2 mice during the acute response, nor was there a defect in the development of this
population in chronically infected Il212/2 mice. However, Il212/2 mice displayed a defect in IgG production after infection
that correlated with a decrease in GC B cell numbers, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in the brain were reduced over the
course of the chronic infection leading to a decrease in total IFN-c production and an increase in parasite numbers
associated with susceptibility to toxoplasmic encephalitis. Together, these results identify a key role for IL-21 in shaping the
humoral and cellular response to T. gondii, but indicate that IL-21 has a limited role in regulating immunopathology.

Introduction
Infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii results in
a persistent infection that affects the central-nervous system and is
typically regarded as asymptomatic [1]. T. gondii has the ability to
invade and replicate within host cells, and long-term resistance to
this organism is dependent on the ability of CD8+ T cells to
recognize and respond to infected cells through cytokine
production or cytolysis, making them an integral part of the
protective immune response against this organism. Thus, depletion
of CD8+ T cells alone, but not CD4+ T cells, during chronic
infection with T. gondii leads to increased susceptibility, emphasiz￾ing the importance of these lymphocytes in the local control of
parasites in the brain [2]. Likewise, B cells also contribute to the
control of this intracellular parasite and B cell deficient mice
challenged with T. gondii succumb to disease between 3 to 4 weeks
after infection. However, these mice can be rescued through
administration of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody [3], indicating that
B cell production of parasite specific antibodies contributes to the
control of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE).
While the cell-mediated immune response is essential for control
of T. gondii in the brain, this response must be regulated in order to
prevent damage by the immune response. In particular, the
production of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) during chronic TE has an
important role in limiting pathology as several studies have
suggested that in its absence [4], or when its production is
impaired [5], a lethal inflammatory response ensues in the brain
characterized by increased numbers of CD4+ T cells and elevated
production of inflammatory cytokines. One cytokine that is
involved in the induction of IL-10 by CD4+ T cells is IL-27;
however, it is unclear whether this is a direct effect of IL-27 on
CD4+ T cells, or an indirect effect through IL-27 mediated
induction of IL-21, which then drives IL-10 expression [6,7].
The cytokine IL-21 is a member of the common c chain (cc)
family of cytokines, which includes IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-15 that
are involved in T cell proliferation and homeostasis [8]. For
example, IL-21 is produced by multiple CD4+ T cell subsets
including, follicular helper T (TFH) cells [9,10], and was originally
described as a cytokine that regulates immunoglobulin production
[11]. It is now recognized that the functions of IL-21 also include
the induction of IL-10 and IL-17 by CD4+ T cells [6,7,12,13,14],
and it is an important factor for the development of TFH cells
[15,16]. However, there are reports that IL-21 is unable to induce
the expression of Bcl-6 [17], a transcription factor critical for TFH
cell differentiation, and Il212/2 and Il21r2/2 mice have normal
or near normal levels of TFH cells following viral infection [18], or
immunization with sheep red blood cells, ovalbumin, or
4(hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl coupled to keyhole limpet hemo￾cyanin [19,20,21]. While IL-21 may not be necessary for
differentiation of TFH cells, it is essential to the function of these

cells as TFH cell-derived IL-21 is crucial for maintenance of
germinal center (GC) B cells [19,21,22,23]. In contrast to the role
of IL-21 in the regulation of humoral immunity, IL-21 has been
shown to be critical for controlling chronic viral infections,
particularly LCMV, due to its ability to maintain an effective anti￾viral CD8+ T cell response [18,24,25].
Prior studies have established that Il21r2/2 mice infected with
T. gondii survive for at least 100 days post-infection, yet these mice
display a defect in serum IgG [11]. Additionally, IL-21 has been
associated with the differentiation of IL-10 producing CD4+ T
cells [6,7], which contribute to limiting immune-mediated
pathology during toxoplasmosis. However, questions remain about
the role of IL-21 in promoting IL-10 and antibody production.
Therefore, to elucidate the function of IL-21 in antibody
production, CD8+ T cell responses, and regulation of the immune
response after infection, Il-212/2 mice were challenged with T.
gondii. In this study, IL-21 deficient mice chronically infected with
T. gondii have increased numbers of parasites in the brain
associated with a decrease in parasite-specific antibody production
and a marked reduction in the numbers of effector CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells in the brain, resulting in diminished IFN-c
production. Furthermore, no immunopathology was apparent in
Il212/2 mice over the course of the infection, nor was there a
defect in development of IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in chronically
infected Il-212/2 mice. Together, these studies indicate the
importance of IL-21 in maintaining a TH1 effector T cell response
in the brain during chronic infection.
Results
IL-21 is Required to Control Chronic Infection with
T. gondii
In light of recent findings describing the involvement of IL-21 in
GC reactions, IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells, and in
maintenance of CD8+ T cell responses, experiments were
performed to determine if IL-21 was involved in these processes
during T. gondii infection. Similar to results observed with Il21r2/2
mice [11], intraperitoneal infection of Il212/2 mice with cysts
from the ME49 strain of T. gondii did not result in increased
susceptibility to acute or chronic disease over the time course
examined (Fig. 1A). However, when Il212/2 mice were orally
infected with ME49 cysts mice survived acute infection, but
succumbed to chronic infection between 50-60 days post-infection
(Fig. 1A). While no difference in parasite burden, pathology in the
gut or the immune response was apparent during the acute
response (Fig. 1B–D), histological examination of the brain
revealed an increase in the number of cysts/field in Il212/2 mice
compared to wild-type littermate controls (Fig. 2A, B). This
difference in parasite burden was confirmed by real-time PCR,
which indicated that by day 35 post-infection there was an
elevated amount of parasite DNA in the brain of Il212/2 mice
compared to wild-type mice, which remained elevated at day 56
(Fig. 2C). Together these results suggest that production of IL-21 is
important for control of parasite replication in the brain during
chronic TE.
Expression of IL-21 and IL-21r during Toxoplasma
Infection
Given that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are a source of IL-21 [26],
expression of this cytokine by these populations in the spleen and
brain was examined after infection. In the spleen of naı¨ve wild￾type mice a small percentage of CD4+ T cells were positive for
intracellular IL-21, and expression of this cytokine was increased
in acutely and chronically infected mice (Fig. 3A). However, IL￾21+ CD8+ T cells were not detected in the spleen at any time point
during infection (data not shown). In contrast, a larger proportion
of CD4+ T cells were found to express IL-21 in the brain of
chronically infected wild-type mice, and examination of CD8+ T
cells revealed a large proportion of these cells are positive for IL-21
(Fig. 3B, C), indicating that these cells gain the ability to produce
this cytokine within the brain. No, IL-21 expression was found in
T cells derived from the spleen or brain of IL-21 deficient mice
confirming specific detection of IL-21 in wild-type mice (Fig. 3A,
B).
Next, to determine if T cells in the brain were capable of
responding to IL-21 the expression of its cognate receptor was
examined. IL-21r expression was detected on a proportion of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen of naı¨ve mice, and
expression of this receptor was maintained on T cells during
chronic infection (Fig. 3D). Also, IL-21r expression was detected
on infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the brain during chronic
TE (Fig. 3D). Comparison of IL-21r expression on T cells from the
spleen and brain of chronically infected mice indicated that a
smaller percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the brain express
the receptor and that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for IL￾21r was reduced on CD8+
, but not CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3D). It is
plausible that reduction in IL-21r expression on T cells in the
brain reflects downregulation of the receptor as part of a negative
feedback loop following IL-21 stimulation; however, IL-21r
expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen and brain
of IL212/2 mice resembled that observed for wild-type T cells
(data not shown). Regardless, these results indicate that IL-21 is
actively secreted during T. gondii infection, particularly in the
brain, and that effector T cells (CD44highCD62Llow, data not
shown) produce and are capable of responding to this cytokine.
IL-21 is Required to Maintain Germinal Centers during
Chronic T. gondii Infection
Several recent studies have highlighted the involvement of IL-21
in antibody production and proposed that IL-21 contributes to
differentiation of TFH cells, and is essential for GC B cell survival
and proliferation [17]. Therefore, to determine if there are any
defects in the antibody-mediated immune response following T.
gondii infection STAg-specific IgM and IgG production was
measured in the serum of chronically infected wild-type and
Il212/2 mice. While no defect in STAg-specific IgM was
apparent, Il212/2 mice had a reduction in STAg-specific IgG,
including cytophilic IgG2c (Fig. 4A). A defect in IgG production
and not IgM is consistent with a role for IL-21 in thymus￾dependent (TD) antibody production. As TD antibodies are
primarily derived from GC reactions, GC B cells were examined
at day 35 post-infection. Defined by PNA+ staining, GC B cells
were detectable in the spleen of chronically infected Il212/2 mice;
however, the percentage and number of GC B cells was reduced
compared to their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
while the number of PNA+ B cells in the spleen increased in wild￾type mice over the course of the infection Il-212/2 mice showed
only a marginal gain (Fig. 4B).
To determine if an altered TFH cell compartment accompanied
the defect in GC B cell numbers in the absence of IL-21, the TFH
cell response was evaluated over the course of the infection. While
there was no difference in the proportion or number of TFH cells,
defined as CD4+
ICOS+
CXCR5+
, at day 35 post-infection, or at
any other time point examined earlier in the infection (data not
shown), the percentage and number of these cells in the spleen
decreased in Il212/2 mice as the infection progressed to day 56
post-infection (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that IL-21 is not
absolutely required for development of TFH cells, but may be

necessary for either maintaining this population of T cells, or that
the observed reduction in GC B cell numbers is the cause of this
late decrease in TFH cell numbers in Il212/2 mice [27].
The Role of IL-21 in the Production of IL-10 during TE
The production of IL-10 in the brain is critical for prevention of
immune-mediated pathology during chronic TE and limiting
accumulation of mononuclear cells within the brain [4]. Since IL￾21 is implicated in the induction of IL-10 by CD4+ T cells [6,7],
we sought to determine if IL-21 is required for production of IL-10
by T cells during chronic TE and if it impacted the overall amount
of inflammation. When BMNCs were isolated from chronically
infected wild-type and I1212/2 mice, and were examined for their
ability to make IL-10, no difference in the percentage of IL-10+
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells was seen (Fig. 5A), suggesting that IL-21 is
not required to induce IL-10 production by T cells in this setting.
Moreover, while there was no decrease in splenocyte numbers
(data not shown) absence of IL-21 led to a significant decrease in
the number of mononuclear cells (P = 0.0005) recovered from the
brain of Il212/2 mice (Fig. 5B), including CD4+ (P = 0.0215) and
CD8+ (P = 0.0003) T cells (Fig. 5C). Additionally, there was a
significant decrease in the number of infiltrating macrophages
(CD45+
CD11bhigh) (P = 0.0149) and microglia (CD45+
CD11blow)
(P = 0.0321) by day 35 post-infection (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, as
the infection progressed the number of total cells recovered from
the brain of Il212/2 mice continued to decline compared to their

wild-type littermates (data not shown). The diminished BMNC
numbers in Il212/2 mice translated into a significant reduction in
the number of IL-10+ CD4+ T cells (P = 0.0326) and a decrease in
CD8+
IL-10+ T cells in the brain (Fig. 5D). While this result
indicates that fewer CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are capable of
producing IL-10 this did not result in increased inflammation in
the brain of Il212/2 mice as opposed to the excessive immune￾mediated pathology observed at this site in Il27ra2/2 and Il102/2
mice with TE [4,28].
IL-27 can promote the development of IL-10 producing CD4+
T cells, and as mentioned, the absence of IL-27 signaling
significantly reduces the number of IL-10–producing T cells in
the brain during TE [5]. Several studies indicate that IL-21 is
necessary for promoting IL-10 production downstream of T cell
activation, or stimulation with IL-27 [6,7], yet the above findings
contrast with these reports. Therefore, to directly determine if IL￾21 is involved in induction of IL-10 by IL-27, CD4+ T cell￾enriched splenocytes from wild-type and Il212/2 mice were
activated with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) plus anti-CD28 in the
presence of IL-27 under non-polarizing conditions (anti-IFN-c and
anti-IL-4) in either complete RPMI (cRPMI) or IMDM. The latter
media was chosen because IMDM contains natural agonists for
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) [29], and activation of AhR
has been shown to enhance IL-27 induced IL-10 [30]. Surpris￾ingly, under these conditions absence of IL-21 did not impair the
ability of IL-27 to induce IL-10 in either cRPMI or IMDM
(Fig. 5E). Additionally, no difference in IL-10 was measured in the
supernatant of wild-type and IL-21 deficient splenocytes stimulat￾ed with IL-27 using either medium, thus these results mirror that
of the intracellular stain (data not shown).
Loss of IL-21 Leads to Reduced T Cell-mediated IFN-c
Production during Chronic TE
The data in Figure 1 shows that Il-212/2 mice have an elevated
parasite burden in the brain. Since the ability of T cells to control
T. gondii in the brain is dependent on production of IFN-c [2]
studies were performed to determine if the T cell response in the
brain of Il212/2 mice is impaired. Though IL-17+ T cells make up
a small percentage of the total population, there was no observed
difference in IL-17 production by T cells in the brain of wild-type
and Il212/2 mice (data not shown). Not surprisingly, the reduced
population of T cells recovered from the brain of Il212/2 mice
translated into a significant decrease in the number of IFN-c+
CD8+ (P,0.0001), and CD4+ T cells (P = 0.0009) compared to
wild-type mice (Fig. 6A). However, there was also a decrease in the
percentage of IFN-c+ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the brain of
Il212/2 mice, and the MFI for IFN-c was also reduced (Fig. 6B).
These data suggest that a loss of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells capable
of producing IFN-c in the brain of Il212/2 mice contribute to the
increased parasite burden.

Effects of IL-21 on Long-lived T Cell Responses
IL-21 has been suggested to play a role in the generation of
CD8+ T cell memory [31]. Therefore, in order to rule out a
requirement for IL-21 in the generation or maintenance of a
memory CD8+ T cell response wild-type and Il-212/2 mice
were infected with a replication deficient strain of T. gondii
expressing ovalbumin (DCPSII-OVA) and then challenged 30
days later with RH-OVA parasites. In this model of immuni￾zation it has previously been shown that CD8+ T cells are
essential for survival against challenge with RH-OVA parasites
[32]. Similar numbers of OVA-tetramer+ CD8+ memory T cells
were observed in wild-type and Il-212/2 mice after challenge
with the DCPSII-OVA parasites, and these mice were able to
survive challenge with lethal RH-OVA parasites (data not
shown), indicating that IL-21 is not required for generation or
maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells.
A possible explanation for the reduction in T cell numbers in
the brain of Il-212/2 mice may be an increase in cell death as IL￾21 has previously been shown to upregulate anti-apoptotic
proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [33,34]. Intracellular staining

for Bcl-2 protein in T cells isolated from the brain of chronically
infected wild-type and Il-212/2 mice indicated that a higher
proportion of CD4+ (P = 0.0136) and CD8+ (P = 0.0010) T cells
from IL-21 deficient mice are Bcl-2+
, resulting in no significant
disparity in the total numbers of Bcl-2+ CD4+ or CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 7A). As another correlate to determine if the absence of IL-21
leads to an increase in programmed cell death splenocytes and
BMNCs were stained for annexin V, a marker of early apoptosis.
A comparison of annexin V staining in the spleen of chronically
infected mice revealed no difference between the percentage and
number of T cells undergoing apoptosis in wild-type and Il-212/2
mice (data not shown). While there was no variance in the
percentage of CD4+ T cells that stained positive for annexin V
there was increased expression by CD8+ T cells in IL-21 deficient
mice, consequently a similar number of CD8+ T cells are
undergoing apoptosis in the brain of Il-212/2 mice compared to
their wild-type littermates, even though there are less total CD8+ T
cells (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that apoptosis is occurring at
an increased rate in CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells in the
brain of IL-21 deficient mice.
Discussion
The previous studies that Il21r2/2 mice infected with T. gondii
survive to 100 days post-infection without showing any sign of
increased susceptibility [11], are incongruous with a role for IL-21
in the induction of IL-10, TFH cell development or B cell responses
[15,16,19,21,22], as well as the maintenance of effector CD8+ T
cell responses [18,24,25]. Therefore, experiments were performed
to reevaluate the function of IL-21 during toxoplasmosis. The
finding that Il212/2 mice are susceptible to chronic toxoplasmosis
is more consistent with current models of the role of IL-21. One
possible explanation for the different outcomes using Il21r2/2 and
Il212/2 mice may be the route of infection used, as oral infection
may have had an affect on dissemination of the parasite as well as
priming of the acute response.
Nevertheless, there are similarities with the previous report
using Il21r2/2 mice [11]. There was a pronounced reduction in
IgG production in the serum of chronically infected Il212/2 mice,
particularly STAg-specific IgG2c. The finding that Il212/2 mice
were able to generate some class-switched antibodies indicates that
other factors, such as IL-6, may also be involved in this process
[35]. The reduction in STAg-specific IgG appeared to be a

reflection of the loss of GC B cells, rather than impairment in
differentiation of TFH cells in the absence of IL-21. Indeed,
expression of Bcl-6, a transcription factor required for differenti￾ation of TFH cells, was not reduced in these cells from Il212/2
mice (data not shown). Nor, was any difference in TFH cell
numbers noted until well after a decrease in the GC B cell
population had occurred; thus, these results are similar to reports
that concluded that TFH cell development in Il212/2 and Il21r2/
2 mice immunized with a number of model antigens or after acute
LCMV infection is largely intact [18,19,20,23], and emphasize the
importance of IL-21 in maintaining GC B cells [19,21,23].
Additionally, the decline in TFH cell numbers in the spleen of
Il212/2 mice at day 56 post-infection suggests that loss of IL-21 as
a B cell survival factor indirectly impacts survival of TFH cells,
potentially through disruption of cognate interactions between
these two cell types that are necessary to sustain TFH cells. While
T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite, several studies have
identified requirements for B cells in mediating protective

Function of IL-21 in Chronic T. gondii Infection

immunity against this pathogen [3,36,37]. Thus, our finding that a
reduction in parasite-specific antibody is accompanied by an
increase in parasite burden in the absence of IL-21 lends support
to a functional role of parasite-specific antibody in protection
against this parasite.
How IL-21 is able to shape effector T cell responses is not fully
understood. It has been proposed that IL-21 in combination with
other signals, may regulate terminal differentiation and memory T
cell formation through modification of the Bcl-6–Blimp-1 axis, as
Blimp-1 expression is associated with terminal differentiation and
reduced proliferation while Bcl-6 expression can promote survival,
proliferation and memory differentiation [38]. Thus, acquisition of
IL-21 production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen or
brain during chronic Toxoplasma infection, along with loss or gain
of additional undefined signals, may favor differentiation of T cells
towards a phenotype that produces high amounts of IFN-c, and
can be continually sustained during chronic infection in order to
control parasite burden.
In addition to its stimulatory effects on B cell and CD8+ T cell
proliferation, IL-21 has been linked to production of the anti￾inflammatory cytokine IL-10, specifically IL-27 induced IL-10
[6,7]. While there is evidence that IL-21 can induce IL-10 by T
cells [7] it is unclear if this is a direct effect on IL-10 transcription,
or a secondary effect of its ability to promote expansion of IL-10
producing T cells. Furthermore, as IL-21 transcription occurs
downstream of IL-6 and IL-27 signaling [6,12,13,14], the
importance of this cytokine as an immune-regulator may be more
pertinent to augmenting or sustaining production of IL-10 rather
than initiation of this response. Also, the finding in which CD4+ T
cells cultured in the presence of antigen-presenting cells do not
require autocrine IL-21 in order to induce IL-10 production
following IL-27 signaling, suggests that another signal, possibly
through a cell ligand-receptor complex like ICOSL-ICOS [6], or a
different cytokine may contribute to an enhancement of IL-10,
and highlights the presence of multiple pathways that induce IL￾10. Moreover, while the number of IL-10 producing T cells is
reduced in the brain of Il-212/2 mice during chronic TE the
frequency of IL-10+ CD4+ T cells, including IFN-c+
IL-10+ double
producers (data not shown), is normal, emphasizing that this
cytokine is not absolutely required for IL-10 production by T cells.
Rather, these studies have indicated an essential role for IL-21 in
production of protective anti-parasite specific antibody through
preservation of GC B cells, and maintenance of a localized TH1
response in the brain during chronic T. gondii infection.

Function of IL-21 in Chronic T. gondii Infection
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e62889

The ME49 strain of T. gondii was prepared from chronically
infected CBA/ca mice and experimental animals were infected
intraperitoneally or orally with 20 cysts. Mice were monitored
daily throughout the infection. Mice were euthanized by CO2
inhalation during the chronic infection if they showed any of the
following symptoms: cachexia, dehydration, reduced motor
function or activity. Soluble toxoplasma antigen (STAg) was
prepared from tachyzoites of the RH strain as described previously
[39]. For histology small intestines and brains were collected from
mice, fixed in 10% formalin, were embedded in paraffin, sectioned
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For measurement of
parasite burden in the small intestine and brain, the 35-fold
repetitive T. gondii B1 gene was amplified by real-time PCR with
Power SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) in an AB7500 fast real-time PCR machine (Applied
Biosystems) using published conditions [4].
Antibodies and Staining Procedures for Brain
Mononuclear Cells (BMNC)
BMNCs from chronically infected wild-type and Il212/2 mice
were isolated in accordance with a published protocol [4]. Live
cells were assessed by preincubation with AmCyan LIVE/DEAD
Fixable Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In order to
assess ex vivo intracellular cytokine production cells from the spleen
and brain were surface and intracellularly stained as previously
described [40]. Additionally, intracellular IL-21 was measured by
staining first with a recombinant mouse IL-21R subunit Fc
chimera protein (R & D systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by
staining with PE–conjugated anti-human IgG (Fcc-specific)
(eBioscience). Annexin V staining was performed as outlined
using the annexin V staining kit from BD Biosciences (San Jose,
CA). Samples were run immediately after labeling with a FITC–
conjugated anti-annexin V antibody. Flow cytometry assays used
the following antibodies: FITC–conjugated annexin V, FITC–
conjugated Bcl-2, PE–conjugated IL-21R, PE-Cy7–conjugated
IFN-c, APC–conjugated IL-10 (BD Biosciences), and eFluor450–
conjugated CD4, PerCp-Cy5.5–conjugated CD8, APC￾eFluor780–conjugated CD8, APC-eFluor780–conjugated
CD62L, PE-Cy7–conjugated CD44 (eBioscience). Samples were
acquired on a BD CantoII (BD Biosciences) and results were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
Analysis of Splenic GC B Cells and Follicular Helper T Cells
Live cells derived from the spleen were assessed by preincuba￾tion with AmCyan LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain
(Invitrogen) prior to surface staining. Antibodies used for staining
included Fluorescin–labeled peanut agglutinin (PNA) (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), FITC–conjugated anti-ICOS,
biotin–labeled anti-CXCR5, PerCp-Cy5.5–conjugated anti-CD4
(BD Biosciences), APC-eFluor780 anti-B220/CD45R, eFluor450–
conjugated CD19 and APC–conjugated streptavidin (eBioscience).
T Cell Differentiation
CD4+ T cells were isolated from splenocyte samples and lymph
nodes that were depleted of CD8+ and NK1.1+ cells to enrich for
CD4+ T cells by magnetic bead separation (Polysciences, Niles,
IL). Cells were plated in 96-well round-bottom plates (BD
Biosciences) at a density of 56106 cells per ml in either cRPMI
or IMDM (Invitrogen). Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3
(1 mg/ml; eBioscience) and anti-CD28 (1 mg/ml; eBioscience).
Additionally, IFN-c and IL-4 were neutralized in all cultures with
anti-IFN-c (10 mg/ml; XMG1.2, eBioscience) and anti-IL-4
(10 mg/ml; 11B11; NCI Preclinical repository). For production
of IL-10+ T cells, cultures were supplemented with recombinant
mouse IL-27 (50 ng/ml; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). CD4+ T
cells were supplemented with fresh medium and reagents on day 3
and were collected on day 4. T cells were restimulated with PMA
and ionomycin plus brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
prior to intracellular staining. Cells were stained using the
following antibodies: PerCp–conjugated anti-CD4, PE–conjugat￾ed anti-CD8, and APC–conjugated anti-IL-10 (BD Biosciences). A
FACSCalibar (BD Biosciences) was used for flow cytometry, and
data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar).
Statistics
Unpaired Student’s t-tests were used to determine significant
differences, and P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
