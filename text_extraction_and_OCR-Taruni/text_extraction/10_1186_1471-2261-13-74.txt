Abstract
Background: Patients with Down’s syndrome and shunt lesions are at high risk of developing pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH) earlier than patients without Down’s syndrome. However, data on the efficacy of PAH-specific therapy
in patients with Down’s syndrome are limited. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to determine the long-term
efficacy of the dual endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, in Eisenmenger's syndrome (ES) patients with Down’s
syndrome.
Methods: In this observational study adults with Down’s syndrome with a confirmed diagnosis of ES (World Health
Organization functional class III) and receiving bosentan therapy and were followed up long term. Clinical evaluation at
baseline and follow-up visits included resting transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation and laboratory assessments.
Exercise capacity was evaluated using a 6-minute walk test where transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation at peak
exercise (SpO2), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and Borg dyspnoea index were assessed. A full echocardiographic
assessment was conducted at baseline and follow-up visits.
Results: Overall, seven adults (mean age 29.6 ± 11.2 years; 57% male) received bosentan at a starting dose of 62.5 mg
twice daily. This was increased to the target dose of 125 mg twice daily 4 weeks later. All patients remained on bosentan
until the end of the study. After a mean (± standard deviation) duration of 52.2 ± 3.9 months (range: 46.0–55.5 months),
6MWD had increased from 199.6 ± 69.1 metres to 303.7 ± 99.9 metres (P < 0.05) and SpO2 at the end of the 6-minute
walk test had increased from 61.6 ± 7.6% to 74.7 ± 6.2% (P < 0.05). Echocardiography demonstrated a significant change in
acceleration time from 62.9 ± 11.6 m/s to 83.0 ± 9.6 m/s (P = 0.0156), and acceleration time/ejection time ratio from the
pulmonary flow from 0.24 ± 0.04 at baseline to 0.30 ± 0.02 (P = 0.0156) at final follow-up.
Conclusions: Long-term treatment with bosentan significantly improved exercise capacity and oxygen saturation
following exercise in adult ES patients with Down’s syndrome. These data confirm that the presence of Down’s
syndrome does not affect the response to oral bosentan therapy.

Background
Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) with sig￾nificant untreated left-to-right shunt lesions are at risk
of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Eisenmenger’s syndrome (ES), a clinical condition with
an initial large systemic-to-pulmonary shunt that in￾duces severe pulmonary vascular disease [1], represents
the most advanced form of PAH-CHD and is char￾acterised by reversed pulmonary-to-systemic (right-to￾left) shunt and central cyanosis. The Euro Heart Survey
on adult CHD (a retrospective cohort study with a 5-
year follow-up) reported PAH in 531 (28%) patients [2],
while a Dutch registry showed a PAH prevalence of
4.2% in 5970 adult patients with CHD [3]. In the latter
registry, 58% of patients with a septal defect who devel￾oped PAH had ES.
Patients with Down’s syndrome represent an important
subgroup in the ES population as they are considered to be
at risk of PAH earlier than patients without Down’s syn￾drome and also have worse functional capacity [4]. This is
probably due to different pathogenetic factors between pa￾tients with and without Down’s syndrome [5]. Down’s syn￾drome has been estimated to occur in ≈ 1.1/1000 adults in
the UK [6] and ≈ 1/732 infants in the USA [7]. However,
there is some evidence that prevalence varies between dif￾ferent racial and ethnic groups [8]. The association between
Down’s syndrome and CHD has been well established [9].
The prevalence of CHD in patients with Down’s syndrome
is 40–60% [10,11] and the types of malformation that are
most commonly associated with trisomy 21 are the atrio￾ventricular and ventricular septal defects (AVSD and VSD),
which together account for 76% of all CHD seen in patients
with Down’s syndrome [12]. Although AVSD is frequently
reported as the most common cardiac defect, there is some
evidence that this varies according to sex and ethnicity
[8,10-15].
Treatment options for ES patients are limited and the
Bosentan Randomized Trial of Endothelin Antagonist
Therapy-5 (BREATHE-5) study, which demonstrated the
efficacy and tolerability of the endothelin receptor antag￾onist, bosentan, is the only placebo-controlled study in
this population to date [16]. Data in patients with Down’s
syndrome are even more limited, with the only evidence
of the efficacy of PAH-specific therapies in this population
being from small, or single-centre studies [17-22].
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long￾term efficacy of bosentan in adult ES patients with Down’s
syndrome.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from
consecutive adult ES patients with Down’s syndrome (mild
cognitive impairment verified by the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale – Revised [23]) treated with bosentan at
our centre. Permission to collect data prospectively was
obtained from the parents or the legal tutor prior to enter￾ing the study. Adults with a diagnosis of ES confirmed by
right heart catheterization, in World Health Organization
(WHO) functional class III between May 2007 and April
2008 were included. The final follow-up visits took place
between January and February 2012.
Clinical evaluation at baseline included: medical history,
WHO functional class, resting transcutaneous arterial
oxygen saturation (SaO2) for 30 minutes and liver en￾zymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate amino￾transferase [AST]). Exercise capacity was evaluated using
a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) where the following vari￾ables were assessed: rest and peak exercise transcutaneous
oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, systemic blood pres￾sure, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and Borg dyspnoea
index. Several days prior to the 6MWT patients were edu￾cated about the 6MWT. The test was performed under
the same environmental conditions and at approximately
the same time of the day (± 1 hour) in all patients and
physicians observed the patients’ attention and approach
to the 6MWT.
A complete Doppler echocardiography (echo) study was
conducted in each patient according to current European
guidelines [24]. The following variables were assessed:
right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure from tricuspid re￾gurgitation (TR) jets, maximal velocity from pulmonary
regurgitation jets, acceleration/ejection time ratio (AcT/
ET) from the pulmonary flow, direction and maximal vel￾ocity across the VSD.
Bosentan was administered at a starting dose of 62.5 mg
twice daily immediately after the baseline assessment. The
dose was increased to the target dose of 125 mg twice daily
4 weeks later. Follow-up assessments were conducted in all
patients at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 of bosentan therapy and
every 6 months, thereafter. Assessments included measure￾ment of SpO2, blood tests, 6MWT and Doppler echo
examination.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as means with standard
deviations and ranges, categorical data are presented as
counts and percentages. Statistical analyses were performed
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Variables were
analysed at baseline and at sequential follow-up visits. A
p value < 0.05 was considered as the level of significance.
Results
In total, seven adults (four males, three females) with
Down’s syndrome and ES were included. Their mean age
was 29.6 ± 11.2 years, all patients were in WHO functional
class III and had a VSD (two with associated mitral valve
regurgitation). None of the patients had received previous
PAH-specific therapy. Oxygen therapy was required

Clinical assessment
In comparison with the baseline evaluation, at the final
follow-up assessment, there was an improvement to
WHO functional class II in one patient. Mean SaO2 at rest
increased from 81.7 ± 6.6% (range 71–88%) at baseline to
89.0 ± 3% (range 87–92%) (P < 0.02) at Month 24 and
88.3 ± 3.2% (range 84–93%) at the final follow-up assess￾ment (p < 0.05). AST and ALT levels increased slightly in
one patient, but remained lower than twice the upper
limit of normal.
The mean 6MWD increased from 199.6 ± 69.1 metres at
the baseline assessment to 291.9 ± 115 metres at Month
24 (P = 0.016) and 303.7 ± 99.9 metres at the final follow￾up assessment (P = 0.016). The mean SpO2 at the end of
the 6MWT was 61.6 ± 7.6% at the baseline assessment,
74.3 ± 5.4% at the Month 24 assessment (P = 0.016) and
74.7 ± 6.2% at the final follow-up assessments (p = 0.016).
Borg dyspnoea index was 3.6 ± 1.4 at baseline and 2.4 ± 1.1
at the final follow-up assessment (not significant). Diastolic
blood pressure decreased from 80.0 ± 5.8 mmHg (range:
70–90 mmHg) at the baseline assessment to 68.6 ±
4.8 mmHg (range: 60–75 mmHg) at the final assessment
(Table 1, and Figure 1).
Doppler echo assessment
Baseline echo parameters are shown in Table 2. At final
follow-up there was a significant change in AcT (p < 0.0156)
and AcT/ET ratio (p < 0.0156) from the pulmonary flow. RV
and left ventricular systolic functions remained stable during
follow-up (Table 2).
Discussion
In this long-term analysis, treatment of adult ES patients
with Down’s syndrome with bosentan for a mean period
of more than 4 years resulted in significant initial improve￾ments in SaO2 at rest and 6MWD that were sustained
during follow-up. Treatment options for patients with ES
are limited, with the BREATHE-5 study being the only
placebo-controlled study in this population [16]. It dem￾onstrated that bosentan significantly reduced pulmonary
vascular resistance index and mean pulmonary arterial
pressure and significantly improved 6MWD in ES patients
in WHO functional class III. Safety (change from baseline
in SpO2) was the primary endpoint in the BREATHE-5
study and the authors demonstrated that bosentan did
not worsen oxygen saturation. Data from a number of
studies, including the current study, have since con￾firmed these benefits in the longer term in patients
with PAH-CHD and specifically in patients with ES
[19,21,25-28]. In addition, PAH-specific therapy has
been shown to significantly lower the all-cause mortal￾ity rate in a large population of ES patients, providing
strong conceptual support for treatment of all ES pa￾tients with PAH-specific therapy [29].
Patients with Down’s syndrome are at risk of develop￾ing PAH earlier than patients without Down’s syndrome
and have worse functional capacity [1]. Both these fac￾tors are associated with poor long-term outcome
[4,5,29-31]. There are no randomized controlled trials
in this subpopulation of PAH-CHD patients. The results
of our long-term analysis support data from previous
open-label studies, which have demonstrated the effi￾cacy of bosentan in ES patients with Down’s syndrome
[19-21], and suggest that up to 4 years’ treatment can be
beneficial in these patients. A previous study has shown
that there was no significant difference in mortality be￾tween ES patients with and without Down’s syndrome
after 4 years of bosentan treatment [21]. Similarly, no
differences in the efficacy of bosentan between PAH￾CHD patients with and without Down’s syndrome in a
12-month study have been reported, with both groups
showing significant improvements in 6MWD, WHO
functional class and haemodynamics [20].
The validity of the 6MWT in patients with Down’s syn￾drome has been questioned as it has been reported that
level of intellectual disability is an independent factor for
6MWD [32]. Vis and coworkers showed that there was a
significant difference in mean 6MWD between the group
with a mild/moderate level of intellectual disability (318 ±
92 metres) and the group with a severe/profound level of
intellectual disability (195 ± 84 metres). In our study, pa￾tients had a low level of intellectual disability; however,
6MWD was in the range seen in patients with severe intel￾lectual disability in the Vis study. Importantly in the
current study, patients achieved a significant increase in
6MWD with long-term bosentan therapy. These findings
are similar to those from a recently published series of pa￾tients which demonstrated that 6MWD increased in pa￾tients with Down’s syndrome during the first 12 months of
bosentan therapy – achieving early significance – and this
improvement from baseline was maintained during a fur￾ther 24 months of therapy [18]. Although it has been
shown that there is no discrepancy between improvement
in 6MWD and haemodynamic parameters in patients with
Down’s syndrome [20], it is clear from the contrasting re￾sults from published small studies that we still need to
understand more about use of the 6MWT in this

population. Consequently, although there is some debate
about the most appropriate assessment in this patient
population, evidence of bosentan efficacy has been dem￾onstrated. Based on our experience, we believe that pa￾tients’ compliance – in the presence of mild intellectual
disability – is sufficient to guarantee a reliable result as
confirmed by the assessment of objective parameters.
In the present study we did not perform an invasive
evaluation such as right heart catheterization during follow￾up visits. However, several studies report a high correlation
(0.57 to 0.93) between echocardiographic and haemo￾dynamic measurements of pulmonary arterial systolic pres￾sure and, therefore, the echocardiographic assessment used
in the current analysis provides valid information [33-35].
Baseline values of TR velocity and pulmonary arterial sys￾tolic pressure in the patients included in the current study
were higher than those associated with the presence of pul￾monary hypertension as specified in the current guidelines
[24]. Additional variables to confirm the presence of pul￾monary hypertension were also included in accordance with
the guidelines (i.e. increased pulmonary valve regurgitation
velocity, shortened acceleration time of RV ejection into the
pulmonary artery, increased dimensions of the right heart
chambers, abnormal shape and function of the inter￾ventricular septum and increased right ventricular wall
thickness and pericardial effusion were demonstrated).
WHO functional class remained stable in the majority
of patients during treatment, with an improvement in
functional class being achieved by one patient. In the
BREATHE-5 study, pulmonary vascular resistance index
increased in the placebo arm during the 16-week study
period, demonstrating the progressive nature of ES [16].
As a result, the maintenance of patients in WHO func￾tional class III during prolonged bosentan therapy is
encouraging.
The long-term results from this study provide confirm￾ation of the significant improvement in exercise capacity
and SpO2 in ES patients with Down’s syndrome seen in
previous studies [17,20,21]. Additionally, this improve￾ment was quick and progressive (in the first 6 months)
and was then stable for up to 48 months.
Our study has some limitations, specifically the small
number of patients and the lack of a placebo-controlled
group and that data are only confirmed by echocardiog￾raphy and not by right heart catheterization. However, it
represents, with few other studies, one of the largest series
of ES patients with Down’s syndrome treated with bosentan
for an extended period. As a result the significant and stable
increase in 6MWD and oxygen saturation are of clinical
relevance.
Conclusion
Long-term treatment with bosentan in adult ES patients
with Down’s syndrome was well tolerated and significantly
improved oxygen saturation and 6MWD. Our study con￾firms that the presence of Down’s syndrome does not
affect the response to oral bosentan therapy in adult ES
patients.
