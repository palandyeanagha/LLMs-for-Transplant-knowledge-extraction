Abstract
Neutrophil heterogeneity was described decades ago, but it could not be elucidated at the time whether the existence
of different neutrophil subsets had any biological relevance. It has been corroborated in recent years that neutrophil
subsets, defined by differential expression of various markers, are indeed present in human blood, calling for
renewed attention to this question. The expression of the granule protein olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) has been
suggested to define two such neutrophil subsets. We confirm the simultaneous presence of one OLFM4-positive and
one OLFM4-negative neutrophil subpopulation as well as the localization of the protein to specific granules. In vitro,
these neutrophil subsets displayed equal tendency to undergo apoptosis and phagocytose bacteria. In addition, the
subpopulations were recruited equally to inflammatory sites in vivo, and this was true both in an experimental model
of acute inflammation and in naturally occurring pathological joint inflammation. In line with its subcellular localization,
only limited OLFM4 release was seen upon in vivo transmigration, and release through conventional degranulation
required strong secretagogues. However, extracellular release of OLFM4 could be achieved upon formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) where it was detected only in a subset of the NETs. Although we were unable to
demonstrate any functional differences between the OLFM4-defined subsets, our data show that different neutrophil
subsets are present in inflamed tissue in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate NETs characterized by different markers
for the first time, and our results open up for functions of OLFM4 itself in the extracellular space through exposure in
NETs.

Introduction
Neutrophil granulocytes develop from myeloid precursor cells
in the bone marrow. The cells are then mobilized and released
into the bloodstream, where they circulate until prompted to
transmigrate into sites of tissue injury or infection or cleared by
age. The mature peripheral blood neutrophils contain a large
number of preformed secretory organelles of variable size,
protein content, and function. Four different secretory organelle
subsets termed azurophil granules, specific granules,
gelatinase granules and secretory vesicles are formed and
loaded with newly biosynthesized proteins sequentially during
myelopoeisis. When the cell transmigrates into tissue and
becomes activated, the ease with which these different granule
populations are mobilized varies, with degranulation occurring
in the opposite order to that in which the granules were formed
[1,2].
Neutrophils from healthy individuals have historically been
viewed as a homogenous population of cells that carry out the
same functions, display the same properties during
inflammation and in response to infection, and are equipped
with the same granule proteins. However, neutrophil
heterogeneity in terms of protein expression was discovered
several decades ago, without convincing evidence to claim that
the existence of different neutrophil subsets was biologically
relevant [3]. More recent findings concerning the presence in
circulation of distinct subsets of neutrophils, characterized by
the expression of different markers, prompt renewed attention
to this question [4,5]. One marker that defines two neutrophil
subsets in humans is CD177 [6], and another is olfactomedin 4
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69575

(OLFM4), very recently described by Clemmensen et al. [7].
OLFM4 is a matrix glycoprotein expressed in prostate, small
intestine, colon, stomach, and bone marrow tissue of humans
[8]. All myelopoietic cells in the bone marrow of healthy
individuals contain and express the OLFM4 gene, most
strongly at the myelocyte/metamyelocyte stage of
differentiation. In accordance with the time for OLFM4
synthesis in the bone marrow, the protein is stored in the
specific granules. In blood neutrophils, OLFM4 defines two
distinct subpopulations; one containing OLFM4 while the other
does not. The OLFM4-positive proportion varies between 10–
30% of circulating neutrophils in different individuals, and the
bimodal protein expression despite uniform mRNA levels
indicates that post-transcriptional regulation is responsible [7].
It is known that OLFM4 is upregulated during, and plays a role
in, tumorigenesis [9], and mouse studies have indicated a
negative role of OLFM4 during infection [10,11]. However, it is
not known whether OLFM4 marks a neutrophil subpopulation
with a specific purpose, and the function of the OLFM4 protein
itself in human neutrophils has not been studied.
Here, we confirm the existence of two subpopulations,
defined by the expression of OLFM4, in human blood, as well
as specific granule localization of the protein. The
subpopulations did not display any differences in terms of
proneness to undergo apoptosis or ability to phagocytose
bacteria, nor in their propensity to transmigrate into tissue in
response to inflammatory stimuli. Nevertheless, we show that
both subpopulations are present in extravascular tissues –
sites where neutrophils typically carry out their functions. That
OLFM4 was present after in vivo transmigration to tissues is in
line with the subcellular localization of the protein and strong
secretagogic stimulation was required to attain conventional
secretion by degranulation. Release of granule proteins can
also occur via non-classical secretion e.g., through the
formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [12]. When
neutrophils were induced to form NETs in vitro, OLFM4 could
be detected extracellularly, associated with DNA, and in
contrast to other NET constituents, OLFM4 was present in only
a subpopulation of the NETs. Although no direct functional
differences between the neutrophil subsets were found, our
data show that the two neutrophil subtypes, defined by OLFM4
expression, are present in tissue and that OLFM4 can be
released from the cells through NET formation, which opens up
for potential extracellular functions/effects by the protein.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Board of
Gothenburg, Sweden (No. 543-07 and No. S010-03). Written
informed consent was obtained from the participants.
Neutrophil isolation from blood and tissue
Blood neutrophils were separated from heparinized whole
blood or one day-old buffy coats from healthy blood donors by
dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-paque centrifugation
according to Boyum et al. [13,14]. After separation, the
neutrophils were washed twice and resuspended in Krebs￾Ringer glucose (KRG) phosphate buffer supplemented with
Ca2+ (1 mM) and stored on ice until use. The typical purity of
the polymorphonuclear leukocytes obtained by this method
was around 95%. Neutrophils isolated from whole blood were
used in experiments that quantified the OLFM4-defined
subpopulations, while buffy coat cells (which also displayed
bimodal expression of OLFM4) were routinely used for
functional assays.
In vivo-transmigrated neutrophils were obtained by two
different approaches. Firstly, after written informed consent,
skin chamber neutrophils were obtained from three healthy
volunteers. The skin chamber technique is an experimental
model of acute inflammation where blisters are formed on the
forearm of the healthy volunteer by negative pressure, the
blister roofs are subsequently removed and a collection
chambers containing autologous serum are applied to the
lesions. Neutrophils are then allowed to transmigrate into the
collection chambers over 24 h. Details on skin chamber
methodology are given in [15]. This technique typically yields a
neutrophil purity of around 90% [16]. For comparison,
peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from the same
subjects on the day of cell harvest. Secondly, after written
informed consent, synovial fluid cells were isolated from the
knee joints of three patients with inflammatory arthritis during a
disease flare (one polyarthritis, one rheumatoid arthritis and
one spondylarthritis). Synovial fluid was aspirated, and within 2
h, the fluid was filtered through a cell strainer and centrifuged
before resuspension of the cells in KRG and storage on ice
until use. The synovial fluids included in the study contained
between 80-90% neutrophils, as determined by flow cytometry
on live cells. Peripheral blood was drawn and neutrophils
isolated from the same study subjects on the day of synovial
fluid aspiration.
Immunofluorescent staining
OLFM4 was stained using indirect immunofluorescence.
Neutrophils in suspension (1x106
 per sample), neutrophil
cytospins on microscope slides (2x105
), or NETs on glass
cover slips (see below) were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde,
washed, and permeabilized using ice cold acetone and
methanol at a 1:1 ratio for 5 min, or left unpermeabilized as
indicated. Unspecific staining was blocked for using blocking
buffer (10% normal goat serum and 2% bovine serum
albumin). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human OLFM4 antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 5 µg/ml) was added and samples
incubated for 30 min. After washing, samples were incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488- or 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(F(ab’)2
 fragment) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, 5 µg/ml) for
30 min, and washed. Samples in suspension were then
analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6, data analyzed
in CFlow software and displayed using FlowJo). Alternatively,
samples were supplemented with DAPI at 60 nM for staining of
DNA and analyzed using an imaging flow cytometer (Amnis
ImageStream10, data analyzed using the colocalization wizard
in Ideas software v. 5.0 as described by others [17]). Samples
for microscopy were mounted using ProLong Antifade with
DAPI (Invitrogen) and then analyzed using a confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM 700 equipped with Zen 2009 software

for acquiring images that were then processed in PhotoShop
CS5.1). Isotype controls, or the omission of primary antibody,
were routinely used to ensure specific binding of the
antibodies, and to set gates for positive staining.
Other granular proteins were stained using the same
procedure. Mouse monoclonal anti-human neutrophil
gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) antibody (Abcam) was
diluted to 5 µg/ml, mouse monoclonal anti-human
myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark)
was diluted to 200 µg/ml, mouse monoclonal anti-human CD63
antibody (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was diluted
to 2 µg/ml, and rabbit anti-human lactoferrin antibody (DAKO)
was diluted to 100 µg/ml. Alexa Fluor 488- or 647-conjugated
secondary antibodies were used in these experiments. CD177
was stained using a mouse anti-human CD177 antibody
conjugated with phycoerythrin (Abcam), diluted 1:5, and CD16
with a mouse monoclonal anti-human CD16 antibody
conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
(EuroBioSciences, Friesoythe, Germany), diluted 1:20. Single
stains were routinely performed to rule out overbleed between
fluorescence channels in microscopy or compensate for these
in flow cytometry and imaging flow cytometry.
Subcellular fractionation and Western blot
Subcellular fractionation of disintegrated neutrophils was
performed on discontinuous Percoll gradients by the
Borregaard [18] technique. Briefly, diisopropyl fluorophosphate-
(Fluka, Seelze, Germany) treated neutrophils were disrupted
by nitrogen cavitation (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL,
USA), after which intact cells and nuclei were removed by a
low speed centrifugation. The postnuclear supernatant was
layered onto a three step Percoll gradient and after
centrifugation (17000 x g for 30 min), 1 mL fractions were
collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Granule
marker analysis was performed to ensure separation in the
gradient of the following organelles: azurophil granules (MPO),
specific granules (lactoferrin), geleatinase granules
(gelatinase), secretory vesicles (latent alkaline phosphatase)
and plasma membranes (alkaline phosphatase). The contents
of lactoferrin and gelatinase were analyzed by Western
blotting, using rabbit anti-human lactoferrin (DAKO) and rabbit
anti-human gelatinase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), both at 2
µg/ml. The subcellular localization of OLFM4 was also
determined by Western blotting, using polyclonal rabbit anti￾human OLFM4 antibody (Abcam, 0.5 µg/ml).
Conventional degranulation assay
In order to induce different degrees of secretion of granule
contents, two secretagogic stimulations were used. Neutrophils
diluted in KRG were treated at 37oC with cytochalasin B (5
µg/ml) for 5 min followed by ionomycin (0.5 µM) for 10 min, a
strong non-physiological stimulation that results in efficient
release of specific granules [19]. Alternatively, the cells were
incubated at 15oC without stimulus followed by 10 min at 37oC
with the addition of N-formyl-Met-Leu–Phe (fMLF, 10-7 M), a
physiological, weaker stimulation that causes release of
approximately 10% of specific granules [20]. Subsequently,
fixation and staining of cells was carried out as described
above. Fluorescence intensity in the isotype controls did not
change with stimulation (data not shown).
Apoptosis induction and detection
Neutrophils were allowed to enter apoptosis spontaneously
or in the presence of Fas ligand (FasL) at 10 µg/ml (mouse
anti-human CD95, eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA),
essentially as described [21], for either 4 h or 20 h at 37oC with
5% CO2
. The cells were then either fixed and stained for
OLFM4 as described above or left non-fixed. To detect
apoptosis in fixed and stained cells, a TdT-mediated dUTP-X
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection
Kit, Fluorescein, Roche, Penzberg, Germany) was used to
detect fragmented DNA, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and analyzed by flow cytometry. To study cell
death in non-fixed cells incubated in the presence or absence
of recombinant OLFM4 (rOLFM4, 0.1, 0.5, or 1 µg/ml),
neutrophils were washed and stained using Annexin V-Fluos
(for apoptosis) and 7-AAD (for necrosis), and analyzed using
flow cytometry as previously described in [22].
Phagocytosis assay
The avirulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis laboratory strain
H37Ra expressing GFP was used in phagocytosis assays. The
bacteria were cultured and prepared for infection as previously
described [23], and then either complement opsonized through
incubation for 30 min at 37oC in 50% normal human serum, or
left unopsonized. Neutrophils were diluted in KRG to 5x106
/ml,
and without further washing of the bacteria, phagocytosis was
carried out for 30 min at 37oC at a multiplicity of infection of 5:1.
Fixation and staining of OLFM4 was performed as described
above, and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Induction of NET formation
NET formation was induced essentially as described in [24].
Briefly, neutrophils isolated from whole blood were diluted to
4x105
/ml in RPMI supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and
seeded on glass cover slips placed in a 24-well plate (500 µl/
well), and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37oC with 5% CO2
. They
were then stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 20
nM) for 3 h at 37oC with 5% CO2, fixed, and processed for
immunofluorescent staining as described above. In order to
visualize the plasma membranes of the cells, the stained
samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated wheat germ
agglutinin (WGA, 1 µg/ml), which is a sugar-binding protein
with specific plasma membrane affinity [25], for 10 min at RT,
and washed three additional times prior to mounting in DAPI￾containing medium as above. Confocal microscopy was
performed as described above.
Neutrophil activation assay
The shedding of L-selectin from the cells is indicative of
neutrophil activation. Neutrophils were treated with TNFɑ (10
µg/ml), rOLFM4 (1 µg/ml), or left untreated for 20 min at 37oC.
They were then washed and stained for L-selectin using PE￾conjugated mouse anti-human CD62L (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) diluted 1:40, as previously described
Neutrophil Subpopulations in Tissue and NETs

in [16]. The mean fluorescence intensity of L-selectin staining
was measured using flow cytometry.
Results
OLFM4 is a specific granule protein expressed in a
subset of human neutrophils in circulation
In order to study the expression of OLFM4 protein in human
neutrophils in circulation, we isolated and fixed neutrophils from
peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. The cells were
permeabilized and immunofluorescently stained for OLFM4
together with other known granule markers. Typically around
95% of the gated cells stained positively for NGAL, a specific
granule matrix protein, as well as for CD63, a protein present in
the membrane of azurophil granules, while only a clearly
distinct subpopulation stained positively for OLFM4 (Figure
1A). Isolated neutrophils from 21 independent whole blood
donors were stained for OLFM4 and the OLFM4-positive
proportion varied between 8% and 57%, with a mean of 34%
(Figure 1B). To visualize the two OLFM4-defined neutrophil
subpopulations, we immunostained for OLFM4 in neutrophils
adhered to microscope slides, and again confirmed the
presence of clearly distinguishable OLFM4-positive and -
negative subpopulations (Figure 1C).
It is noteworthy that the method used for permeabilization of
the cells was essential to capture OLFM4-positivity, and
saponin permeabilization was insufficient for efficient staining
of OLFM4 (data not shown). Using acetone and methanol for
permeabilization, OLFM4 expression in one individual was
similar over time (range of 22-26% OLFM4-positive neutrophils
at three different sampling times over the course of one year),
and parallel staining of neutrophils from different donors gave
different OLFM4-positive proportions. Isolated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells showed very low expression of OLFM4 in all
cells, and purified eosinophils showed no expression of OLFM4
(data not shown). Furthermore, we confirmed the existence of
two subpopulations using commercially available anti￾neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) slides containing
ethanol-fixed human neutrophils, yielding a cytoplasmic ANCA
staining pattern in only a subpopulation of the cells (data not
shown), providing an external control of our protocol. Finally,
the OLFM4-negative and OLFM4-positive neutrophil subsets
could not only be detected in isolated cells, but also in whole
blood, after lysis of erythrocytes and staining of all leukocytes
(data not shown).
Aside from OLFM4, neutrophil subpopulations defined by the
presence or absence of CD177 have been described. This
molecule is present on the plasma membrane and in granules
of 0 to 100 % of neutrophils in healthy individuals [6,26].
Double staining of neutrophils for OLFM4 and CD177 revealed
that CD177 expression was distributed evenly among the
subsets defined by OLFM4 (Figure 1D), showing that the
markers do not co-vary.
OLFM4 has been found by others to be expressed mainly in
the specific granules of neutrophils [7,10]. In order to confirm
this, we first employed an imaging flow cytometry method
followed by colocalization analysis of neutrophils
immunofluorescently stained for OLFM4 and the specific
granule marker NGAL. This revealed a high degree of
colocalization between OLFM4 and NGAL, while that between
OLFM4 and the azurophil granule marker CD63 was lower,
consistent with specific granule localization (Figure 2A). We
supplemented these findings with an investigation of OLFM4
protein abundance in different granule fractions after
subcellular fractionation. The azurophil granule fraction tested
(fraction 1, identified by MPO content) and secretory vesicle
fraction tested (fraction 22, identified by latent alkaline
phosphatase activity) did not contain OLFM4 (Figure 2B). A
clean distinction between specific granules (identified by
lactoferrin) and gelatinase granules (identified by gelatinase) is
not possible using this method, but the OLFM4 staining pattern
was very similar to that of lactoferrin, again indicating mainly
specific granule localization (Figure 2B). In fact, the different
granule subsets are not entirely distinct from each other, but
rather form a continuous gradient where different cargo is
packed into the granules depending on the time of formation
during myelopoeisis, a mechanism termed “targeting by timing
of biosynthesis” [1].
OLFM4 expression does not predispose neutrophils to
apoptosis or phagocytosis
Having confirmed the existence of an OLFM4-positive and
an OLFM4-negative neutrophil subpopulation in human blood,
we wanted to investigate whether the subsets are functionally
different. First, we tested whether the proneness to undergo
apoptosis differed between the subsets by incubating
neutrophils for 4 or 20 h with or without FasL, an effective
inducer of apoptosis, after which cells were stained for
fragmented DNA (a sign of apoptosis) using TUNEL, together
with OLFM4. The FasL-treatment resulted in varying degrees
of cell death, but OLFM4-positive and -negative neutrophils
were equally prone to undergo apoptosis (Figure 3A).
Furthermore, quantification of OLFM4- and NGAL-positivity in
freshly prepared cells compared to cells subjected to overnight
incubation with or without FasL showed that OLFM4-positivity
does not change with cell age or induction of apoptosis (Figure
3B). This is consistent with Clemmensen et al. [7], who found
that bimodal expression of OLFM4 appears at the myelocyte
stage of maturation in the bone marrow, indicating that loss or
gain of OLFM4 is not a function of cell age.
To investigate another functional aspect that could potentially
differ between subsets of neutrophils, we chose to study
phagocytosis in the OLFM4-positive and -negative populations
using M. tuberculosis as a model organism. However, no
difference in the proportion of phagocytosing cells was found
between the two subpopulations, regardless of whether
unopsonized or opsonized prey was used (Figure 3C). The
same result was obtained when unopsonized or serum￾opsonized yeast was used as prey (data not shown).
The OLFM4-expressing subpopulation transmigrates
into tissue
As neutrophils typically carry out their major functions after
transmigration from the bloodstream, it is highly relevant to ask
whether both neutrophil subsets are able to transmigrate to
extravascular tissue. A potential difference in the ability to

transmigrate could be an effect of OLFM4 itself, or more likely,
of other factors that characterize the OLFM4-defined subsets.
We investigated this using cells obtained in two different
manners. Firstly, we used experimental skin chambers, an
established controlled model of in vivo transmigration to acute
inflammation in otherwise healthy skin [15]. By comparing
OLFM4-positivity in skin chamber- and blood neutrophils from
the same donor, we found that the OLFM4-positive and –
negative subpopulations both indeed transmigrated into tissue,
and to an equal extent (Figure 4A). Secondly, we obtained in
vivo transmigrated neutrophils from naturally occurring,
pathologically inflamed tissue by aspirating synovial fluid from
Figure 1. Analysis of OLFM4 expression in human neutrophils. A) Immunostained neutrophils were analyzed by flow
cytometry. The first dot plot shows forward versus side scatter and the neutrophil gate in a representative donor. The two

the knee joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Again,
when comparing the tissue neutrophils to blood neutrophils
from the same subjects, we found that the proportion of
OLFM4-positive cells was similar in blood and tissue (Figure
4B). In addition to demonstrating the ability of both subsets to
transmigrate, these results indicate that OLFM4 is largely
retained inside the cell after in vivo transmigration. Of note, the
proportion of OLFM4-positive blood neutrophils did not differ
markedly between inflammatory arthritis patients and healthy
controls (compare blood neutrophils in Figure 4A and 4B).
Conventional secretion of OLFM4 is limited under
physiological conditions
The fact that the OLFM4-positive subpopulation remained
clearly discernible after in vivo transmigration into inflamed
tissue is consistent with specific granule localization, as
specific granules are only marginally secreted during
transmigration [27]. For degranulation of specific granules to
occur, strong secretagogic stimulation is required [19,20,28]. In
line with this, after stimulation of blood neutrophils with a weak,
physiological secretagogue (fMLF [20]), most OLFM4 was
retained with a slight uniform decrease in fluorescence intensity
Figure 2. Subcellular localization of OLFM4. A) Neutrophils were immunofluorescently stained for OLFM4 (green) together with
specific granule marker NGAL or azurophil granule marker CD63 (red), and DNA was labeled with DAPI (blue). Colocalization was
analyzed by imaging flow cytometry and images show representative cells from the double positive populations (BF = brightfield).
The diagram shows the mean colocalization score for the two fluorophores +SD from at least three experiments. The technical
positive control was FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD16 antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 647-coupled goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody and the technical negative control was FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD16 antibody together with DAPI,
showing the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained by this analysis. The biological positive control was specific
granule marker lactoferrin (LF) together with NGAL, and the biological negative control was lactoferrin together with CD63, showing
the resolution of the analysis. B) Pooled neutrophils from three donors were subjected to subcellular fractionation, and the fractions
containing peak content of azurophil granule marker (MPO; fraction 1), specific granule marker (lactoferrin; fractions 10-12),
gelatinase granule marker (gelatinase; fractions 13-15) and secretory vesicle marker (latent alkaline phosphatase; fraction 22) were
subjected to Western blot with anti-OLFM4 antibody using rOLFM4 as a positive control. One representative blot out of three is
shown. Lactoferrin (specific granule marker) and gelatinase (gelatinase granule marker) blots are also shown for fractions 10-15.

of the OLFM4-positive subpopulation (Figure 5). In contrast,
strong secretagogue stimulation (cytochalasin B + ionomycin
[19]) caused the OLFM4-positive subpopulation to disappear
altogether, indicative of complete release of OLFM4 from the
cells (Figure 5). This is again consistent with specific granule
localization of OLFM4, and NGAL showed a very similar
pattern (Figure 5).
OLFM4 is a constituent of NETs formed from OLFM4-
positive neutrophils
Since physiological stimulation (in vivo as well as in vitro) did
not lead to major release of OLFM4, we wondered whether

non-conventional mechanisms of secretion could be a route to
release OLFM4. We postulated that NET formation may be one
situation where the OLFM4 protein can be exposed
extracellularly, with the potential to affect surrounding immune
components. NETs are extracellular meshwork-like structures
composed of processed chromatin, granular proteins and
selected cytosolic proteins, and are thought to function to trap
microbes [12,29], but also to play a role in autoimmune
disorders by exposing otherwise intracellular endogenous
components to the immune system [30–32]. Whereas acetone/
methanol permeabilization was required to detect OLFM4 in
unstimulated adherent cells (Figure 6A) the protein was readily
detected without permeabilization after induction of NET
formation (Figure 6A). Interestingly, OLFM4 was only found in
a subpopulation of the NETs, likely those arising from the
OLFM4-positive subpopulation. We indirectly tested this by
incubating either unfixed or fixed NETs with rOLFM4 prior to
staining as described above. OLFM4 did not bind DNA under
the conditions tested, as the staining pattern looked identical in
NETs incubated with or without rOLFM4 (data not shown).
These results together suggest that the OLFM4 found in a NET
originates from the neutrophil that formed the NET, rather than
having been released and then bound back to the DNA. In
order to further confirm the localization of OLFM4 to only a
subpopulation of NETs, we performed double staining of
OLFM4 and the known granule-derived NET protein MPO [33].
MPO could be found uniformly in all NETs while OLFM4 was
only found in a subset (Figure 6B). OLFM4 staining in NETs
was not due to unspecific binding of the secondary antibody
(Figure S1). Thus, during NET formation, OLFM4 localizes to
the NET of its parent cell. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of two different subtypes of NETs.
Release of OLFM4 into NETs indicates that surrounding cells
as well as invading microbes can be exposed to and affected
by the protein. The gradual loss of L-selectin from neutrophils
is indicative of cell activation, with resting cells uniformly

displaying high L-selectin staining, cells treated with TNF-α at
37oC displaying low staining, and untreated cells incubated at
37oC displaying intermediate staining [34,35]. Adding rOLFM4
to neutrophils did not activate the cells to shed L-selectin as
compared to the control (Figure 7A). Nor did rOLFM4 alter
neutrophil viability after 20h in culture (Figure 7B). We also did
not find any direct effect of rOLFM4 (at a concentration of 20
µg/ml) on the growth of E. coli or S. epidermidis (data not
shown), using an inhibition zone assay as previously described
[36].
Discussion
In the 1980’s, Gallin [3] established that neutrophil
heterogeneity existed, and debated whether the phenomenon
had any biological relevance. Several of the markers discussed

by Gallin to be differentially expressed on the neutrophil cell
surface [3] can be explained by different degree of neutrophil
activation, and degranulation in the systems studied. This is
also true for several of the different neutrophil subsets more
recently discovered to be associated with systemic
inflammation [37,38], and with tumours and their promotion or
suppression [39,40]. Prominent examples of subset markers
that change with cell activation include L-selectin and CD11b
[37,38], which are present on all neutrophils but differentially
displayed depending on the degree of cell activation [2,34,35].
However, also more recently, neutrophil heterogeneity in terms
of bona fide protein expression has been described [4,5]. The
latter subpopulation markers are more robust, with a genetic
basis in the case of CD177 [26] and an unknown post￾transcriptional mechanism being responsible in the case of
OLFM4 [7]. These recent findings prompted us to revisit the
intriguing question posed by Gallin with today’s platform of
knowledge and analytical tools, using the two subpopulations
defined by the presence or absence of OLFM4 [7] as a
foundation.
We first confirmed that two neutrophil subsets, one
expressing OLFM4 and one not, are present among human
peripheral blood neutrophils [7], and that OLFM4 is a specific
granule protein [7,10]. The higher average proportion of
OLFM4-positive cells in our study as compared to that found by
Clemmensen et al. [7] is likely due to donor variability.
We then set out to study whether any functional differences
between the subsets could be demonstrated. First, we found
that the OLFM4-positive and -negative subpopulations
underwent apoptosis at the same rate. Similarly, there was no
difference in phagocytic ability between the subsets. Although it
has not been investigated whether OLFM4-defined
subpopulations are present in mice, our data agree with murine
studies comparing OLFM4 knockout with wild type mice that
argue for a negative role of OLFM4 during bacterial infection,
despite similar levels of neutrophil phagocytosis [10,11]. A third
functional aspect that we speculated might differ between the
neutrophil subsets was the ability to transmigrate into tissue.
However, comparison of blood and tissue neutrophils, obtained
from a chronically inflamed site (synovial fluid neutrophils) and
Figure 7. Effect of rOLFM4 protein on neutrophils. A) Neutrophils were allowed to enter apoptosis spontaneously (untreated) or
in the presence of rOLFM4 at a range of concentrations, after which they were stained using Annexin V-Fluos (for apoptosis) and 7-
AAD (for necrosis). The dot plots show Annexin V and 7-AAD staining in untreated and rOLFM4-treated cells in one representative
donor after 20 h incubation, and the histogram shows the percentage of neutrophils that have undergone each type of cell death in
untreated and rOLFM4-treated samples, respectively. The mean +SD of three experiments is shown. B) Neutrophils were treated
with rOLFM4 (1 µg/ml) , TNFɑ (10 µg/ml; positive control) or left untreated, for 20 min at 37oC, and analyzed for surface expression
of L-selectin. The shedding of L-selectin from the cells is indicative of neutrophil activation. The histogram shows L-selectin staining
in untreated cells and cells treated with rOLFM4 or TNFɑ in one representative experiment. The bar graph shows the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of L-selectin +SD from three independent experiments.

a site of experimentally induced acute inflammation (skin
chamber neutrophils), revealed that blood and tissue
neutrophils from the same donor had equal proportions of
OLFM4-positive cells. This indicates the same propensity of the
subpopulations to transmigrate into tissue, and that there is no
difference between the subsets in terms of recruitment or
chemotaxis. A functional difference between the two subsets
remains to be found. Such a difference, if present, may not
necessarily be a direct effect of OLFM4 per se, but rather a
function of other factors that possibly co-vary with OLFM4 due
to co-regulation.
Our results show that the OLFM4-defined neutrophil subsets
are also present in tissue where neutrophils typically carry out
their main tasks, and they are not merely a phenomenon in
circulation. Tissue neutrophils are generally more activated
than those in circulation [34], and in vivo transmigration leads
to the mobilization of most gelatinase and a small proportion of
specific granules [1]. The similarity in OLFM4-positivity that we
observed in blood and tissue is consistent with specific granule
localization, as specific granules are largely retained inside the
cells during transmigration [1,27]. Our data furthermore show
that differential OLFM4-expression is not dependent on
neutrophil stimulation or related to degree of neutrophil
activation, in contrast to several other recently described
neutrophil subpopulation markers [5,37–40].
Having found that both OLFM4-positive and –negative
neutrophils are recruited to sites of inflammation, we wanted to
determine whether the OLFM4 protein itself could be exposed
to the extracellular environment. Secretagogic stimulation with
the weak, physiological fMLF led to uniform but only partial
release of OLFM4, while the non-physiological, strong
cytochalasin B + ionomycin treatment caused complete
release. Again, this is consistent with specific granule
localization, and our finding corroborates that of Clemmensen
et al. [7] who used PMA stimulation, which gives efficient
release of about 50% of the specific granules [28], and
obtained a reduction of OLFM4 in specific granule fractions.
Our results indicate that only low levels of OLFM4 are released
during transmigration, even to pathologically inflamed sites,
and that conventional degranulation is not a major
physiological source of extracellular OLFM4.
Neutrophils have multiple roles in tissue during infection.
These include phagocytosis and intracellular killing of
microbes, as well as release of antimicrobial substances into
the extracellular space through degranulation, and the
formation of NETs. NETs are networks of DNA and granular
proteins that are thought to trap and kill microorganisms
[12,29], but can also be thought of as an alternative means of
secretion since their formation inevitably leads to the exposure
of intracellular content to the extracellular space. NETs have
been shown to form both in vitro in response to certain stimuli
[12] and in vivo in tissue [41]. As we found that conventional
degranulation did not lead to major OLFM4 release, we instead
turned to NETs and hypothesized that NET formation could
lead to OLFM4 secretion. Our data show that upon the
formation of NETs through a standard protocol that employs
extensive PMA stimulation of adherent cells, extracellular
OLFM4 can indeed be detected in the NETs. The presence of
OLFM4 in NETs was recently described using a proteomics
approach, supporting our finding [42]. OLFM4 was found only
in a subpopulation of the NETs, while MPO was found in all
NETs, indicating that two OLFM4-defined subsets of NETs
exist. Our results indicate that during NET formation, OLFM4 is
expelled from each respective cell containing the protein into
the NET originating from that cell, rather than being released
into the medium and then binding to all DNA. This notion
supports the theory that granular proteins associate with DNA
prior to expulsion from the cell during NET formation [12].
Although our experiments did not indicate a direct effect of
rOLFM4 on neutrophil activation or viability, nor a direct
antibacterial effect (in agreement with Liu et al. [10]), exposure
of OLFM4 in the extracellular space through NETs may still
have a profound effect on the immune system. Analogously,
CD177-positive neutrophils display proteinase 3 (PR3) on their
surface and are thus a target of ANCA, present in some
autoimmune disorders [43,44]. Binding of ANCA to CD177
positive (and thereby PR3 positive) cells activates them [45],
and it has been proposed that having a high proportion of
CD177-positive neutrophils confers an increased risk of
developing vasculitis [46]. Several recent studies have found
that antigens present in NETs, such as DNA [30], histones [31],
MPO or PR3 [32] can give rise to clinically relevant
autoantibodies in different disorders. It remains to be shown
whether ANCA directed against OLFM4 exist and have clinical
implications.
In conclusion, we confirm the existence of two OLFM4-
defined neutrophil subsets in human circulation and
furthermore show that both subsets are capable of
transmigration into tissue. OLFM4 can be found in a
subpopulation of NETs, suggesting the existence of two distinct
NET populations. Even though the underlying mechanisms to
explain OLFM4 heterogeneity are unknown, the simultaneous
existence of numerous neutrophil subtypes is a fact;
interestingly, co-staining of OLFM4 and CD177 actually
revealed four distinct subpopulations. As of yet, functional
studies have provided no evidence that neutrophil
heterogeneity is biologically relevant, but as evolution rarely
fosters the development of meaningless traits, the
phenomenon deserves further investigation.
