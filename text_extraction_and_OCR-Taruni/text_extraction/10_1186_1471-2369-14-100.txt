Abstract
Background: Recent trends in parathyroidectomy rates are not known. Our objective was to investigate the trend
in parathyroidectomy rates between 2001 and 2010, and to evaluate if the availability and reimbursement of
cinacalcet modified that trend.
Methods: Using a provincial administrative database, we included all adult patients receiving chronic dialysis
treatments between 2001 and 2010 (incident and prevalent) in a time series analysis. The effect of cinacalcet
availability on parathyroidectomy bimonthly rates was modeled using an ARIMA intervention model using different
cut-off dates: September 2004 (Health Canada cinacalcet approval), January 2005, June 2005, January 2006, June
2006 (date of cinacalcet provincial reimbursement), and January 2007.
Results: A total of 12 795 chronic dialysis patients (mean age 64 years, 39% female, 82% hemodialysis) were followed
for a mean follow-up of 3.3 years. During follow-up, 267 parathyroidectomies were identified, translating to an average
rate of 7.0 per 1000 person-years. The average parathyroidectomy rate before cinacalcet availability was 11.4 /1000
person-years, and 3.6 /1000 person-years after cinacalcet public formulary listing. Only January 2006 as an intervention
date in the ARIMA model was associated with a change in parathyroidectomy rates (estimate: -5.58, p = 0.03). Other
intervention dates were not associated with lower parathyroidectomy rates.
Conclusions: A reduction in rates of parathyroidectomy was found after January 2006, corresponding to cinacalcet
availability. However, decreased rates may be due to other factors occurring simultaneously with cinacalcet
introduction and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Background
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common and ser￾ious disease that develops early in chronic kidney disease
and continues to progress after subjects reach dialysis. A
primary consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism
is the development of renal osteodystrophy, which may
manifest as fractures, bone pain and avascular necrosis
[1]. Prevention and treatment of secondary hyperpara￾thyroidism remain a continuous challenge for the neph￾rologist, despite availability of phosphate binders, active
vitamin D analogues and more recently, cinacalcet.
Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic, was approved in March 2004
in the United-States (US) and in September 2004 in
Canada. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is primarily reserved
for symptomatic patients with elevated parathyroid hor￾mone (PTH) levels despite optimal medical therapy.
While cinacalcet has been shown in trials to reduce PTH
levels [2] and to lower incidence of PTX [3,4], it remains
unclear how availability of this new drug influenced PTX
rate trends in a real-world setting. While PTX may be
avoided initially by using cinacalcet, the surgery may only
be delayed to a later time, which would not be observed in
a short-term study. Moreover, efficacy of cinacalcet may be
limited in some patients by its gastrointestinal adverse ef￾fects, which may be more frequent in real-world patients
compared to selected patients enrolled in a randomized-

controlled trial. In a recent placebo-controlled trial, 18% of
patients in the cinacalcet group discontinued the drug be￾cause of adverse events and 7% underwent a PTX [4].
Rates of PTX varied considerably between 1992 and
2007 [5-8]. These fluctuations were attributed to availabil￾ity of new therapeutic options (vitamin D analogs and
non-calcium-containing phosphate binders) and publica￾tion of practice guidelines [5]. Only one study evaluated
PTX rate trends after availability of cinacalcet, which
showed a decreasing PTX rate until 2005 followed by an
increase in rates in 2006–2007. However, this study was
limited to 2007 (less than three years after cinacalcet mar￾keting) [5]. In addition, the effect of formulary listing of
cinacalcet for reimbursement on PTX rates has not been
studied.
The aim of this study was to investigate the trend in
annual PTX rates between 2001 and 2010, and evaluate
if availability and formulary listing of cinacalcet modified
that trend.
Methods
Study population and data sources
This study was conducted using the Régie de l’assurance
maladie du Québec (RAMQ) database in the province of
Québec, Canada. This universal provincial health services
administrative database includes all visits, diagnosis codes
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth then Tenth
Edition (ICD-9, ICD-10)) and procedures (Canadian Clas￾sification of Diagnostic, Therapeutic and Surgical Proce￾dures (CCP) and Canadian Classification of Health
Interventions (CCI)) during in- or outpatient medical en￾counters for virtually all eight million residents of Québec,
Canada. Admission and discharge dates, primary and sec￾ondary diagnoses (coded using ICD-9 or ICD-10 after
2006), and procedures during a hospitalization were
obtained from the hospital discharge summary database.
In addition, information on drugs dispensed to all individ￾uals age 65 years and older, individuals on welfare and
workers insured by the provincial drug plan is captured
within the database. Validation of RAMQ data has shown
high accuracy for a number of conditions [9-12].
Study sample
All adults (≥18 years old) who were on chronic dialysis
(hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) between January 1,
2001 and December 31, 2010 were included. Chronic
dialysis was defined as at least 90 days of dialysis, and
therefore patients with less than 90 days of follow-up
were excluded. Both incident (new patients initiating
dialysis during the study period) and prevalent (patients
already on dialysis at the beginning of the study) patients
were included. Patients with a prior history of PTX
(same codes as for outcome) or kidney transplant (ICD￾9: V42.0; ICD-10: Z94.0; RAMQ: 06221, 06222, 06223)
were excluded, using a two-year look back period (e.g.
January 1999 for patients on dialysis on January 2001). Pa￾tients were censored at PTX, death, kidney transplant￾ation, emigration out of the province, or end of the study
(December 31, 2010).
Outcome
PTX was the primary outcome and was identified through
hospital discharge summary procedure codes (CCP: 19.71,
19.72; CCI: 1FV83, 1FV87, 1FV89) and RAMQ physician
claim code (6186, 6185, 6181).
Intervention period
In Canada, a new drug cannot be marketed before being
approved by Health Canada, which evaluates efficacy and
safety of the drug. After this approval, all patients may re￾ceive the drug, but it will not be reimbursed, except if
the patient is covered by a private insurance company
reimbursing that particular drug. Policies for reimburse￾ment of drugs vary by provinces. For the provincial
drug plan in Québec, decision to reimburse or not a
drug is recommended by a provincial committee from the
Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux
(INESSS), which evaluates its cost-effectiveness ratio and
possible financial burden. Cinacalcet was approved by
Health Canada on September 2004 and became available
for sale in the province of Québec shortly thereafter. How￾ever, cinacalcet was not reimbursed via the provincial for￾mulary until June 2006, and was only reimbursed by private
insurance companies for a few patients who had private in￾surances coverage (less than 22% annually). However,
cinacalcet was provided by Amgen Canada from September
2004 until June 2006 for few selected patients with severe
secondary hyperparathyroidism. Of note, once listed on the
provincial formulary, cinacalcet was available only for pa￾tients meeting specific criteria: 1) at least two PTH values
above 88 pmol/L (829 pg/mL) in a three-month period
despite optimal medical therapy with vitamin D and
phosphate binders; and 2) at least one of the following:
serum calcium ≥2.54 mmol/L (10.2 mg/dL), serum phos￾phorus ≥1.78 mmol/L (5.5 mg/dL), calcium-phosphorus
product ≥4.5 mmol2
/L2 (55 mg2
/dl2
), or bone symp￾toms. For cinacalcet to be reimbursed for a given pa￾tient, the prescriber would need to obtain a prior
authorization from the provincial drug plan by filling a
form detailing those criteria.
Statistical analysis
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
intervention models were used to analyze the effect of
cinacalcet availability on PTX rates. The ARIMA inter￾vention model is a specific time series model. It controls
for trend and seasonal variation and allows for the inser￾tion of input variables to check and evaluate the effects
Lafrance et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:100 Page 2 of 9

of interventions: cinacalcet availability in this case. Be￾cause it produced the most efficient number of points
for this analysis, bimonthly PTX incidence rates were
calculated throughout the study duration. Since the
intervention period (availability of cinacalcet) was not a
single point in time (it became available progressively from
September 2004 to June 2006 as described above), differ￾ent a priori defined dates in that period were used in the
model: Health Canada approval date (September 2004),
Quebec reimbursement (June 2006), in-between dates
(January 2005, June 2005, January 2006), and six-month
post-reimbursement (January 2007). The adequate candi￾date model was chosen according to published guidelines
(parameters significance, graphical evaluation of residuals,
and Akaike Information Criterion) [13,14].
As a sensitivity analysis, rates of PTX pre and post intro￾duction of cinacalcet were compared using a Poisson
regression. In opposition to ARIMA models, Poisson re￾gression does not account for the dependence between
measures seen in our situation (a patient may be present
in different intervals), but its results are more intuitive and
may help validate results from ARIMA. For this analysis,
two periods were defined: 1) a pre cinacalcet period from
January 1, 2001 until August 31, 2004, and 2) a post
cinacalcet period from June 30, 2006 until December 31,
2010. Time between the two periods was not considered
in this analysis. As a second sensitivity analysis, ARIMA
and Poisson regression analyses were redone by excluding
periods of time where patients were not covered by the
RAMQ drug plan.
Because we expected that important patient characteris￾tics such as age, sex, and incident/prevalent status would
change with time [15,16], and that these factors are related
to PTX for secondary hyperthyroidism [17], we plot PTX
rates stratified by those characteristics.
Since cinacalcet is not the only factor that changed over
the study period, phosphate binders (sevelamer, lan￾thanum, calcium-containing, and magnesium and/or
aluminium-containing) and vitamin D use was also mea￾sured. Annual medication use was calculated by dividing
the number of patients with at least two drug dispensa￾tions in a given year by the number of patients at least
partially covered by RAMQ drug plan in that given year.
In order to ensure prescriptions were being fulfilled, two
dispensations were requested for each patient. The average
daily dose for selected medication was calculated includ￾ing: calcium-containing binders, sevelamer, lanthanum,
alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and cinacalcet. Total dose of phos￾phate binders was calculated using relative phosphate￾binding coefficients in order to transform doses of
sevelamer and lanthanum to calcium mg equivalent: 1.0
for calcium carbonate, 0.7 for sevelamer and 2.0 for lan￾thanum [18]. Alfacalcidol and calcitriol are by far the two
frequently used activated vitamin D products in Québec.
For all analyses, a p-value of less than 0.05 was consid￾ered statistically significant. All analyses were done using
SAS 9.2 (Cary, North Carolina).
Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Government of Québec
ethics committee (Commission d’accès à l’information)
and Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital ethics committee,
and informed consent was waived.
Results
There were 12 795 patients on maintenance dialysis in
Québec between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2010.
Derivation of the study cohort is detailed in Figure 1. At
the beginning of follow-up, the mean age was 63.9 years
(SD = 14.6), females represented 39%, and 82% of patients
were on hemodialysis. The mean follow-up was 3.3 years
(SD = 2.6). Most patients had at least part of follow-up
covered by the drug plan (partly for 19.5%, and full for
64.0%), as only 16.5% had only private coverage during
follow-up. Almost half of all patients (49%) died during
follow-up and 15% were transplanted. As shown in Table 1,
patient age increased with time, while proportions of inci￾dent patients and of patients on peritoneal dialysis de￾creased with time.
During follow up, 267 PTX were identified, which trans￾lated to an average rate of 7.0 per 1000 py. Bimonthly rates
of PTX are given in Figure 2. The average rate before
cinacalcet approval was 11.4 /1000 py and was 3.6 /1000
py after cinacalcet reimbursement. The best fitting ARIMA
model did not include a trend term over time. In other
words, rates did not appear to increase or decrease over
time except at the intervention point. Only January 1, 2006
as an intervention date was statistically significant (esti￾mate = −5.58; p = 0.03). Other intervention dates were not
associated with a reduction in PTX rates: September 2004,
estimate = −2.98, p = 0.3; January 2005, estimate = −5.04,
p = 0.07; June 2005, estimate = −4.51, p = 0.09; June 2006,
estimate = −3.72, p = 0.2; January 2007, estimate = −2.53,
p = 0.4. Using a Poisson regression as a sensitivity analysis,
rates were 68% lower after cinacalcet introduction com￾pared to before (incidence rate ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence
interval: 0.23-0.42; p < 0.001). Results for the ARIMA and
Poisson analyses were similar when time periods not cov￾ered by the drug plan were excluded, except that June 2005
became statistically significant in addition to January 2006.
As expected, PTX rates appeared higher for young patients
than older patients, and in prevalent patients compared to
incident patients (Figure 3). PTX rates did not differ by
gender. However, trends of PTX rates were similar
across strata.
Trends in medication use are given in Figure 4 and aver￾age daily doses are shown in Table 2. The proportion of
patients using calcium-containing phosphate binders
Lafrance et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:100 Page 3 of 9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/14/100

remained stable over time, but the average daily dose de￾creased with time. On the contrary, the proportion of pa￾tients using sevelamer increased until 2005 then remained
fairly stable. The average daily dose of sevelamer followed
the same pattern of use. Overall, the average daily com￾bined dose of phosphate binders increased with time.
The percentage of patients on vitamin D was stable
until 2005, and then started to rise. The average daily
dose of alfacalcidol increased only very slowly however,
and calcitriol daily dose remained stable. Use of
cinacalcet increased steadily after 2006, while lan￾thanum was introduced in 2007. For both, the average
daily dose increased slowly with time. Use of magne￾sium or aluminium-containing binders was negligible.
As previously mentioned, before provincial reimburse￾ment of cinacalcet in June 2006, some patients were re￾ceiving cinacalcet from Amgen. According to Amgen
internal data, 4 patients received cinacalcet through this
program in 2004, 40 in 2005, and 58 in 2006. Some private
insurance companies may have reimbursed cinacalcet for
patients not covered by the provincial RAMQ drug plan.
Unfortunately, the exact number of patients receiving
cinacalcet via private insurance is not available in our
database. According to Amgen data, cinacalet claims were
estimated at 241 in 2005 and 385 in 2006 (Amgen internal
data). Assuming monthly claims (12 claims per patients
per year), it can be estimated that 20 patients received
cinacalcet through private insurance companies in 2005
and 32 patients in 2006.
Discussion
In this large population-based study, a significant drop in
PTX rates among patients receiving dialysis after January 1,
2006 is shown. This drop coincides with cinacalcet intro￾duction, but an increasing trend in the use of phosphate
binders (but less calcium-based binders) and vitamin D
across the time period is also shown.

Our results are consistent with a pooled analysis of
short duration trials that showed a reduce incidence of
PTX with cinacalcet (from 41 /1000p-y in the placebo
group to 3 /1000 p-y in the cinacalcet group) [3]. More
recently, a large placebo-controlled trial designed to
evaluate cardiovascular endpoints showed a 69% de￾creased risk of PTX in the cinacalcet group [4]. Few
studies have evaluated trends in PTX rates, and only one
has reported rates after the release of the KDOQI clin￾ical practice guidelines in 2003, and none have included
patients well beyond introduction of calcimetics [5-8].
Li et al. [5] described PTX rates in the US from 1992
to 2007. A PTX peak rate was found in 2002 (12.8 /1000
py) followed by a decreasing rate until 2005 (5.4 /1000 py)
and then an increase again in 2006–2007 (8.6 /1000 py)
[5]. The current data shows a different pattern where the
peak annual PTX rate was in 2004 (16.0 /1000 py) instead
of 2002, followed by a decrease in 2006 (3.9 /1000 py).
After 2006, annual PTX rates remained between 3.0 and
4.6 /1000 py. While January 2006 was the only statistically
significant cut-off point in our model, visually the change
in rate appeared slightly before that and all cut-off dates
between January 2005 and June 2006 showed a trend for a
lower PTX rates. This is consistent with the fact that
cinacalcet market penetration was progressive over that
period of time, and the lack of statistical power may ex￾plain why most were not statistically significant. Despite
not being widely available before June 2006, carefully se￾lected patients could have received cinacalcet from Amgen
or private insurance companies. In the context where
cinacalcet was probably given to patients who would
otherwise have undergone a PTX and because the annual
counts of PTX ranged from 29 to 57 before 2005, only a
few patients receiving cinacalcet could have highly
influenced the observed PTX rates. For this reason, it is
not unexpected to see a flat trend for PTX rates after 2006
while cinacalcet market share continued to increase con￾stantly. Because severe secondary hyperparathyroidism
may not be completely controlled in all patients using
cinacalcet and because some patients may not tolerate
cinacalcet or would prefer to undergo a PTX, it is
expected that rates of PTX would not fall indefinitely. It is
unknown why PTX rates did not increase in 2006–2007
as was observed in the US. However, it is speculated that
wider availability of cinacalcet through reimbursement in
Québec may be a factor. It is also possible that, despite the
KDOQI guidelines opinion-based recommendation for
PTX in patients “with severe hyperparathyroidism (persist￾ent serum levels of intact PTH >88.0 pmol/L [800 pg/mL]),
associated with hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia
that are refractory to medical therapy” [19], Canadian phy￾sicians may be more inclined to wait for symptomatic
hyperparathyroidism before sending a patient for a PTX.
The higher PTX rates observed here among prevalent
and younger patients are consistent with previous studies
and with the physiopathology of secondary hyperparathyr￾oidism [5,20].
The portrait of phosphate binders and vitamin D use
has changed in the last decade. This data shows a clear
shift to lower dosing of calcium-based binders and an
increasing utilization of non-calcium-based binders such
as sevelamer and lanthanum. While the average dose
of vitamin D remains fairly low (alfacalcidol increased
slightly and calcitriol remained stable), the proportion of
prescribed vitamin D increased considerably, reaching
70% in 2010. Unfortunately, only intravenous vitamin D

analogues were available in Li et al. [5] study, therefore
use of phosphate binders, cinacalcet and oral vitamin D
was not reported. Nevertheless, this switch from calcium￾based to non-calcium based phosphate binders is expected
after the publication of studies associating high calcium￾phosphorus product with a higher risk of mortality and car￾diovascular calcifications [21,22]. In 2003, KDOQI guide￾lines [19] recommended a maximum dose of 1500 mg/day
of elemental calcium, which was significantly lower than
the usual practice. The increased of phosphate binders and

vitamin D within this RAMQ data is also probably
explained by the impact of KDOQI Guidelines on clinical
practice and targets for serum phosphorus and PTH, and
initial vitamin D dose. Additionally, cinalcalcet reimburse￾ment was conditional on specific criteria as detailed previ￾ously, and physicians were encouraged to use vitamin D
and phosphate binders to gain access to cinacalcet for
their patients.
This study reports on changes of PTX trends over time,
but cannot establish a causal link between cinacalcet and
lower PTX rates. A stronger design would have been to
compare PTX rates in patients receiving cinacalcet with
rates in patients who did not. However, in the absence of
available PTH levels, it was not possible to identify a con￾trol group that would have had the same severity of hyper￾parathyroidism and did not receive cinacalcet. Therefore,
results would have suffered from an indication bias.
Change in rates may be due to other factors occurring
simultaneously with the introduction of cinacalcet. For ex￾ample, following the publication of the KDOQI Guidelines
use of more aggressive treatments such as higher doses of
phosphate binders and vitamin D may explain lower PTX
rates with time [1,19]. Decreased use of calcium-based
phosphate binders may also explain decreased PTX rates
by decreasing serum calcium, which would allow increase
vitamin D use. Another explanation would be a change of
indication or physician attitude toward PTX. For example,
physicians may now tolerate higher PTH level thresholds
before considering a PTX. However, these clinical practice
changes are usually not acute in time and cinacalcet intro￾duction remains the most probable explanation for the re￾duction in PTX rates observed. Despite the fact that the

drop in PTX rates is visually convincing during the inter￾vention period, we tested six different intervention dates
and statistically significant results may be due to chance
by multiple testing (limited power precluded applying cor￾rection factors such as Bonferroni). The unadjusted PTX
rates are presented, since small numbers precluded
standardization. An aging population may lead to lower
PTX rates while an increasing proportion of prevalent pa￾tients may increase PTX rates. However, the population
characteristics did not change much during the study
years and the same PTX trend pattern was seen among
subgroups (Figure 3). Moreover, adjusting PTX rates in
the Li et al. [5] study did not make a significant difference
in the time period of the current study.
Some PTX procedures may have been missed if they
were not coded. However, claims are required from sur￾geon compensation and it would be unlikely that a PTX
would have been missed. RAMQ codes for PTX did not
change during the study period. If any percutaneous etha￾nol ablation procedures of the parathyroid were carried
out, these would not be captured, as there is no specific
code for this new technique. But this technique was carried
out on one or two anecdotal cases only and cannot explain
the reduced rates. As with most retrospective studies using
dispensed medications, there is uncertainty with patient
compliance. In addition, intravenous vitamin D analogue
claims are not captured within the RAMQ database, since
vitamin D analogues are dispensed by the dialysis unit and
a claim would not be submitted by the patient to the
RAMQ. However, intravenous vitamin D is not commonly
used in Québec, in part for economic reasons and health
care organization. Finally, medication use among patients
covered by private drug plans who are generally younger
patients (an important risk factor for severe secondary
hyperparathyroidism) could not be assessed. However, the
main analysis on PTX trends included all patients regard￾less of age and availability of private insurance. Moreover,
because the ARIMA model relied on time points and not
on patient-level exposure, incomplete ascertainment of ex￾posure does not influence our results. Finally, this study is
limited to a single Canadian province, and results may
not be generalized to other populations with different
healthcare practices.
Conclusions
A decreased annual rate of PTX was found after January
2006, corresponding to cinacalcet availability. However,
decreased rates may be due to other factors occurring sim￾ultaneously with cinacalcet introduction and further stud￾ies are needed to confirm these findings.
