Abstract
Background: Destruction of the architectural and subsequently the functional integrity of the lung following pulmonary
viral infections is attributable to both the extent of pathogen replication and to the host-generated inflammation associated
with the recruitment of immune responses. The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence
of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus,
there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune
responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here
utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary
infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Mice pre-treated with PCN, independent of any specific viral antigens, were protected
against both sub-lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses, a mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus, or mouse
pneumovirus. Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated
induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced
protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT)
in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4+ T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms.
Conclusions/Significance: The immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection-independent induction of
naturally occurring iBALT prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen. This strategy non-specifically enhances primary
immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies.
PCN treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly, ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally
associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung.

Introduction
There is currently no immunoprophylactic strategy to generate
broad spectrum protection against diverse respiratory viral
pathogens. Conventional strategies to protection against respira￾tory pathogens have relied on vaccination against individual virus
strains or the use of drug based therapies. However, the efficacy of
these immunoprophylactic strategies is often significantly limited
by either difficulty in engineering effective vaccines to some
respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, or because of
evasion of acquired immunity as a result of antigenic variation of
circulating respiratory viral pathogens (H1N1 swine influenza
pandemic, 2009). In addition, conventional strategies are generally
not applicable to newly emerging viruses (SARS outbreak, 2003)
since their sudden appearance does not allow for time to develop a
vaccine.
Since many pathogens either directly infect the mucosal
epithelium or enter a host by penetration of mucosal surfaces,
the induction of effective pathogen-specific immunity at local
mucosal sites is becoming a desirable objective of novel
vaccination strategies. Mucosal, as opposed to systemic vaccina￾tion is often more efficacious against mucosal pathogens due to
their ability to induce secretory IgA [1,2]. Despite such an
advantage, vaccination of mucosal epithelial surfaces, especially
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e7142

those of the lung, pose significant safety concerns due to the
fragility of the tissue and the likelihood of triggering unwanted
pulmonary inflammation [3]. Consequently, it is critical that the
development of novel methods for pulmonary immunization focus
not only on the generation of effective mucosal immunity but also
on the amelioration of concomitant inflammatory responses. Thus,
new immunoprophylactic strategies that facilitate the local
generation of protective immunity against a broad spectrum of
lung pathogens and are able to diminish any detrimental
inflammatory sequelae associated with the onset of primary
adaptive and/or innate immune responses at the site of infection
would be highly advantageous.
Therapies that cause the formation of inducible bronchus￾associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) may provide an alternative
immunoprophylactic approach for broad spectrum viral protection
in the lung. Although iBALT development is known to occur in
association with pulmonary immune responses [4,5], the signifi￾cance of the role of iBALT in the resolution of infections has only
recently been investigated, most notably in its role in adaptive
immunity to influenza virus infections [6,7]. Remarkably, iBALT
can replace the function of the spleen and other secondary lymphoid
tissues in primary adaptive immune responses [7] and also support
the maintenance and re-expansion of adaptive immune memory
responses following influenza virus infections [6]. The association of
iBALT with lung pathologies in autoimmune diseases [5], or the
necessity of infection for its induction [4], has diverted attention
from the immunoprophylactic potential of iBALT. Here, we
demonstrate that iBALT can be induced asymptomatically without
infection or ensuing pathology, and that pre-existing iBALT
enhances and accelerates the primary adaptive and likely innate
immune responses to respiratory viruses in the naı¨ve host.
Results
Protection against viral or bacterial infection
The protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) utilized here was derived
from the small heat-shock protein (sHsp 16.5) of the hyperther￾mophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii and is unrelated to other
classes of heat-shock proteins (Hsp 50, 60, 70) [8]. This non￾infectious PCN is comprised of 24 identical subunits that
spontaneously self-assemble into hollow, spherical protein cages
that are 12 nm in diameter (Figure 1). Interestingly, pulmonary
instillation of the PCN induced iBALT development within the
lung parenchyma (Figure 2A) whereas treatment with PBS vehicle
control did not induce any detectable iBALT formation (Figure 2B
and 2C). PCN-induced iBALT structures formed in the submu￾Figure 1. Representative diagram of assembled protein cage

cosa adjacent to blood vessels and lymph ducts associated with
bifurcations of the conducting airways down to the level of the
terminal bronchioles. The PCN-induced iBALT structures
contained B cells, CD4 T cells, follicular dendritic cells
(Figure 2D and 2E), and CD8 T cells (data not shown), similar
to that of iBALT structures induced by influenza infection [7] and
seen in other non-inducible secondary lymphoid tissues [9,10].
Mice treated with PCN were protected against a spectrum of
respiratory viral pathogens. In mice treated 9x with the PCN, the
protection against a subsequent primary influenza virus infection
was characterized by a significantly greater reduction in viral
burdens by day 7 post-infection (Figure 3A), and by the absence of
any weight loss (Figure 3B), and lung damage, as indicated by the
decreased levels of albumin (Figure 3C) and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) (Figure 3D) recovered from the broncho-alveolar lavage
fluid (BALF) [11,12]. Although we also observed an enhancement
of protection when 100 ug of the PCN was administered 3x prior
to influenza infection, we subsequently found that 5 doses of
100 ug/dose of the PCN was optimal to achieve the accelerated
viral clearance and the reduced morbidity. In addition, the
accelerated viral clearance and reduced morbidity levels observed
during the resolution of the influenza infection in the PCN-treated
mice was found to be dose dependent (Figure S1).
To determine the extent to which this PCN treatment could
provide a similar level of enhanced protection against other
respiratory viruses we infected PCN- or PBS-treated mice with
1LD100 of a murine-adapted SARS-coronavirus (Figure 4). Notably,
all PCN-treated mice survived the infection with minimal weight
loss whereas all of the PBS-treated mice rapidly lost weight and died
by day 4 post-infection (Figure 4A and 4B). Similarly, we found that
PCN-treatment enhanced protection in mice infected either with an
alternative influenza virus strain (X31 – H3N2) (Figure S2-A and
S2-B) or infected with pneumovirus of mice (PVM) [13] (Figure S2-
C and S2-D). Infection of mice with PVM results in a viral lung
infection similar to that of RSV infections in humans [13]. To test
whether this phenomenon is common to other PCN constructs,
BALB/c mice were also treated with the human H-chain ferritin
(HFn) protein cage and challenged with influenza virus. As a
control, a group of mice were also treated with bovine serum
albumin (BSA). Although the reduction in viral burdens were
significant for mice treated with the HFN and for those treated with
our PCN, this reduction in viral burden was 100 fold greater in the
PCN treated mice (Figure S3-A). Viral burdens were not
significantly different between the BSA-treated and PBS-treated
mice. Neither HFn nor BSA treatments protected mice from weight
loss following infection (Figure S3-B). Thus, it is evident that the
overall effect of this PCN enhancement of immunity is not a generic
feature of all PCN architectures and that the small heat-shock PCN
appears uniquely well suited to facilitate the enhancement of
protection against a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses.

PCN Enhances Lung Immunity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e7142

The formation of iBALT structures in the PCN-treated mice
(Figure 2A) and the increased cellular content recovered in the
BALF of PCN-treated mice prior to their infection (Table 1) were
indicative of the ability of the PCN to act as a pulmonary
immunostimulatory agent. In spite of this PCN-driven immuno￾stimulation, we did not observe any histological damage to the
alveolar architecture of the lung following the PCN-treatment
regimen. The lack of any lung damage associated with the PCN
treatment was further supported by the absence of any increase in
the levels of serum albumin (Figure 3C) and lactate dehydrogenase
(Figure 3D) recovered in the BALF of these mice at this time and
the absence of any weight loss during the PCN treatment regimen
(data not shown). However, since it has already been demonstrated
that novel small agents can act in an immunostimulatory role in
the lung to enhance protective innate immune responses [14]
against bacterial pathogens and that we could detect immunogenic
changes in the lung following the PCN treatment regimen, we
examined the potential of our PCN treatment regimen to enhance
protection against a range of pulmonary bacterial pathogens.
Three days after the conclusion of the 5x PCN treatment regimen,
mice received a pulmonary challenge of 103 colony-forming units
of the phase 1 variant of Coxiella burnetii. Although the PCN-treated
mice did not experience the level of weight loss observed in the
PBS-control treated mice in the days following infection
(Figure 5A), no difference in the rate of clearance of the C. burnetii
infection was observed between the PBS-control and PCN￾treatment groups (Figure 5B). We also tested this PCN treatment
strategy in a similar fashion using Francisella tularemia and Yersinia
pestis infection models, but again found no enhanced protection
associated with the PCN treatment (data not shown). Thus the
pulmonary immune environment elicited by this PCN treatment
regimen seems to be uniquely suited to enhancing the resolution of
subsequent primary viral infections but not subsequent bacterial
infections of the lung.
Since the PCN was expressed and purified from an E. coli
heterologous expression system, it is most likely to contain residual
contaminating LPS. To investigate a potential adjuvant-like role
for this LPS in the PCN-enhanced protection, we treated C3H/
HeJ mice, which have decreased responsiveness to LPS [15], with
PCN or PBS and then challenged them with PVM (Figure S2-C
and D) or with influenza virus (Figure S4-A, B, and C). C3H/HeJ
mice treated 3x or 5x with the PCN exhibited significantly reduced
influenza viral burdens (Figure S4-A), less morbidity following
influenza virus (Figure S4-B and S4-C) or PVM (Figure S2-C)
infection, and significantly enhanced survival rates following PVM
infection (Figure S2-D) relative to the PBS-treated controls.
Furthermore, dramatically reducing the LPS in the PCN
preparations (1.28 ng/dose) did not significantly alter the
accelerated rate of viral clearance in mice that had been treated
with this preparation (Figure S4-D). Finally, treatment with the
HFn protein cage, which was also produced in E. coli and
presumably with similar levels of LPS contamination, did not
enhance protection against the influenza infection as well as
treatment with the PCN preparation did (Figure S3). Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that the presence of LPS is
not a major contributor to the enhanced protection and that the
small heat-shock PCNs are intrinsically immunomodulatory.
T and B cell roles in enhanced protection
The appearance of PR8 influenza-specific serum IgG, BALF
IgG, and BALF IgA responses was accelerated and significantly
greater in the PCN-treated mice following influenza virus infection

(Figure 6). This lead to speculation that the accelerated influenza￾specific antibody response was a critical component of the
underlying protective mechanism in the accelerated resolution of
infection in the PCN-treated mice. To determine the necessity of
the humoral immune response for this PCN-enhanced protection,
B cell-deficient uMT mice were treated with either PCN or PBS
prior to infection with influenza virus. We observed accelerated
viral clearance in the PCN-treated wild type mice, but not in the
PCN-treated uMT mice (Figure 7A), demonstrating the require￾ment of B cells for the enhanced clearance. However, that the
PCN-treated uMT and wild type mice actually gained weight after
infection whereas the PBS-treated uMT and wild type mice lost
weight (Figure 7B) indicated that the protective effect of the PCN
treatment against body weight loss is not wholly dependent on the
presence of B cells. Thus, the PCN-induced mechanisms
responsible for accelerated viral clearance may be distinct from
those responsible for decreased weight loss.
We also observed that CD4 and CD8 T cells accumulated more
rapidly in the lungs of PCN-treated mice following infection
(Figure 7C) than in the lungs of PBS-treated mice. To determine
whether CD4 or CD8 T cells played a role in PCN-mediated
protection against influenza virus we depleted T cell subsets prior
to and after infection. The accelerated viral clearance was still
observed in PCN-treated mice that were depleted of CD8 T cells
but not in those PCN-treated mice that were depleted of CD4 T
cells or both CD4 and CD8 T cells (Figure 7D). Thus, CD8 T cells
do not play a significant role in the enhanced protection against
influenza infection in the PCN-treated mice, whereas, both B cells
and CD4 T cells are critical for full protection.
Role of iBALT in PCN-enhanced protection
Previous studies have indicated that the existence of iBALT in
the lungs is transient [6]. To determine the duration of enhanced
protection induced by the PCN treatment, PBS- and PCN-treated
mice were challenged with influenza virus 3 to 35 days after
completion of the PCN treatment. Although the protective effects
of the PCN treatment waned as the interval between administra￾tion of the last PCN dose and the influenza infection increased,
viral burdens in the PCN-treated mice infected 35 days after the
last treatment were still significantly reduced relative to the PBS￾treated control mice (Figure 8A). However, protection against
weight loss was not as enduring (Figure 8B), further suggesting that

the PCN-induced mechanisms responsible for accelerated viral
clearance may be distinct from those responsible for decreased
weight loss.
In order to determine whether PCN-induced iBALT structures
could exclusively provide this enhanced protection, we generated
chimeric mice by reconstitution of splenectomized, irradiated
C57BL/6 wild type and lymphotoxin-a (LTa) deficient mice with
wild type or lymphotoxin-a knockout (LTa-KO) bone marrow
cells (BMC). Using these chimeric mice we were able to effectively
isolate iBALT generated immunity from that generated by
conventional secondary lymphatic tissues. The following 4 types
of bone marrow chimeric mice were made; chimeras that lacked
secondary lymph nodes (20
LN) and Peyers patches but could still
form organized iBALT (LTa deficient mice that received wild type
BMC - SLP chimeric mice); chimeras that lacked 20
LN and Peyers
patches and were unable to form organized iBALT due to their
lack of LT-a (LTa deficient mice that received LTa deficient
BMC - LTa-KO chimeric mice); chimeras that retained 20
LN and
Peyers patches but were likewise unable to form organized iBALT
due to their lack of LTa (wild type mice that received LTa
deficient BMC - WT/LTa chimeric mice); and wild type control
chimeras that retained 20
LN and Peyers patches and could form
organized iBALT (wild type mice that received wild type BMC -
wild type chimeric mice) [7]. Following engraftment of the
transferred BMC, the chimeras were treated 5x with PCN or PBS
and then challenged with influenza virus 3 days after the last
treatment. Seven days after infection, the PCN-treated wild type
chimeric mice (filled squares) and SLP chimeric mice (filled circles)
had significantly less virus in their lungs relative to their respective
PBS-treated cohorts (open squares and open circles respectively)
(Figure 8C). The extent of viral clearance in the PCN-treated
WT/LTa chimeric mice (filled triangles) and LTa-KO chimeric
mice (filled diamonds), both of which do not make organized
iBALT [7], was closer to or equivalent to their respective PBS￾treated mice (open triangles and open diamonds respectively).
However, there was no weight loss in any of the PCN-treated
chimeric mice (Figure 8D). Together, these results indicate that
organized secondary lymphoid tissues are not required for the
PCN-induced enhancement of protection against influenza virus
infections and that pre-existing iBALT can exclusively account for
the enhanced protection against the viral infection and is most
likely also associated with the protection against weight loss.

The association of iBALT structures with lung pathology in
auto-immune diseases [5] and our observation that PCN
treatment altered lung micro-architecture, elicited an influx of
leukocytes and enhanced local pulmonary immunity through
iBALT formation suggested that this PCN treatment regimen may
leave the lung susceptible to the development of allergic airway
hyperresponsiveness. To assess this possibility, mice that had been
systemically sensitized to ovalbumin were treated 5x with PCN or
PBS, then given 3 intranasal instillations of ovalbumin and
subsequently challenged with methacholine. Interestingly, airway
hyperresponsiveness (Penh values) was attenuated in PCN-treated
mice (Figure S5-A) and eosinophil influx into the lungs was
reduced (Figure S5-B). These results indicated that the PCN￾induced alterations to the lung did not render the lung susceptible
to or exacerbate allergic airway hyperresponsiveness.
Discussion
Our results clearly indicate that pulmonary instillation of PCN
can dramatically enhance subsequent host immune responses to
primary viral infections of the lung as well as curtailing the extent
of pulmonary damage that these responses can cause. The absence
of damage indicators recovered in the BALF (serum albumin and
LDH) of the PCN-treated mice before infection, their reduced
recoveries after infection and the lack of morbidity in these mice
during the resolution of infection suggests that the PCN-treatment

does not induce inflammatory damage in the lung. Even though
the PCN treatment did alter pulmonary micro-architecture by
inducing iBALT structures and was able to elicit an influx of
leukocytes into the airways, these changes to the immune
environment of the lung were of no apparent consequence to
the well being of the mice. In fact, our results suggest that the
PCN-treatment prior to infection is associated with an ameliora￾tion of the often excessive inflammatory responses that are seen
during the resolution of pulmonary viral infections [16] as well as
airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation associated with
asthma. Interestingly, the alterations to the immune environment
of the lung in response to the PCN treatment had no effect upon
the resolution of pulmonary bacterial infections.
The immunomodulatory effects elicited by the PCN-treatment
are dependent on B cells and CD4 T cells, but not on either CD8
T cells or conventional secondary lymphoid tissues such as the
spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Our results strongly
suggest that these immunomodulatory effects are mediated to a
significant degree by the asymptomatically induction of iBALT in
the lungs of recipient mice. This is consistent with previous results
showing that pulmonary immune responses in the presence of
iBALT are more efficient and less damaging to the host [7].
Because iBALT can serve as a functional lymphoid tissue at the
site of infection, it is likely to acquire antigen more quickly and to
respond to inflammatory signals in the lung more rapidly, thereby
facilitating the acceleration of local adaptive immune responses.
Given that antibodies are extraordinarily powerful at neutralizing
virus, preventing further infection, clearing antigen and even
dampening inflammation via FcR ligation, the accelerated IgG
and IgA responses in the lung most likely contribute, at least
partially, to the enhanced viral clearance in PCN-treated mice.
Adaptive immunity is probably not the only component of the
immune system affected by PCN-treatment, since protection
against a SARS-coronavirus infection was already apparent by 3
days after infection. This is well before an adaptive primary
immune response expands to the point of effectiveness. Thus, it is
likely that innate mechanisms are also modulated by this PCN
treatment. How PCN treatment may enhance innate anti-viral
mechanisms is currently unknown but our data suggests that it
likely involves B cell and/or CD4 T cell-dependent mechanisms.
We believe that induction of iBALT in response to treatment
with PCN represents a promising strategy for pulmonary
immunoprophylaxis. Such a prophylactic strategy could enhance
primary immune responses to a spectrum of respiratory viruses,
making these responses not only more efficient at clearing the
virus, but also less damaging to the lung in the process. The ability
to non-specifically enhance immune protection against a diversity
of respiratory viruses, most notably in the absence of significant
pulmonary inflammation, underscores the potential effectiveness
of this strategy against infections by antigenic variants of currently
circulating viruses (H1N1 swine influenza pandemic, 2009), by
newly emerging viruses (SARS epidemic, 2003) and by the
numerous common respiratory viruses to which specific vaccines
have not yet been successfully developed (RSV vaccines).
Materials and Methods
Mice and viruses
Male and female wild type C57BL/6 (CD45.2), BALB/c, and
mMT (B10.129S2(B6)-Igh-6tmlCgn) mice were bred at Montana
State University, Bozeman, MT. C3H/HeJ (Tlr4Lps-d) male and
female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar
Harbor, ME, USA). B6.SJL-Ptprca
, Pep3b
/BoyAiTac mice
expressing the congenic maker (CD45.1) were purchased from
Taconic Laboratories (Hudson, NY, USA). Bone-marrow chime￾ric mice were generated from splenectomized-irradiated recipient
mice as described [7]. The influenza virus strains A/PR8/8/34
(PR8; H1N1) and A/HKx31 (X31; H3N2) were obtained from the
Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY, USA. The pneumovirus of
mice (PVM) was a gift from Dr. Helene Rosenberg (NIAID, NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA). Work with the murine adapted SARS-CoV
was carried out by Dr. Dale Barnard (Utah State University,
Logan, UT, USA). All studies described here were approved by
the IACUC board at Montana State University or Utah State
University prior to their performance.
Generation of bone marrow chimeric mice
Chimeric mice were generated by bone marrow reconstitution
of irradiated C57BL/6 or lymphotoxin-a knockout (LT-a KO)
mice that had been splenectomized 3 to 4 weeks earlier.
Splenectomized recipient mice were gamma irradiated with 2
doses of 475 rads administered 4 h apart. The recipient mice were
then immediately reconstituted by intravenous tail injection of
26107 congenic CD45.1+ or CD45.2+ donor bone marrow cells
(BMC). The animals then rested for 5 weeks to allow for the
establishment of the engrafted bone marrow cells. The discrepancy
in CD45.1 and CD45.2 markers between donor and recipient
mice was used to monitor the engraftment of the donor BMC
whenever possible. The following chimeric mice were made; wild
type CD45.1+ BMC into wild type CD45.2+ mice, wild type
CD45.1+ BMC into LT-a KO CD45.2+ mice, LT-a KO CD45.2+
BMC into wild type CD45.1+ mice and LT-a KO CD45.2+ BMC
into LT-a KO CD45.2+ mice.
PCN Production
The genomic DNA of Methanococcus jannaschii was obtained from
ATCC (43607). The cloning, characterization and purification of
the small heat-shock protein (sHsp 16.5) from this archaeon was
carried out in an E. coli expression vector as described previously
[17]. The purified PCN was then stored at 280uC until used.
Inoculation procedures and tissue recovery
Administration of the PCN and viral infections were carried out
while mice were under a light anesthesia using 5% isoflurane
inhalation. The PCN inoculations contained 100 mg per dose, the
PR8 influenza inoculum contained 1500 PFU, the X31 inoculum
contained 46106 PFU. The PVM inoculation was a 1:200 dilution
of our viral stock. The SARS-CoV infections were carried out using
a 1LD100 of the viral stock. Coxiella burnetii infections were carried
out using 103 genomic equivalents of the phase 1 variant. Daily
body weights of the mice were monitored following infection.
At designated times following viral infection, mice were sacrificed
by intraperitoneal administration of a lethal dose of sodium
pentobarbital (90 mg/kg) followed by exsanguination when the
mice no longer exhibited a pedal reflex. Lungs were then harvested,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 280uC for future
use in viral plaque assays or for recovery of bacterial genomic copies.
Lungs used for immuno-histological staining were instilled with
O.C.T. Tissue Tek (Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrance CA, USA),
snap frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC for future use.
Lung sections were cut and stained with FITC-conjugated anti￾mouse B220, PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 or PE-conjugated
anti-mouse CD21 (BD Biosciences San Diego CA, USA).
Recovery of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid
Broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were obtained by
washing the lungs with 2.0 ml of 3 mM EDTA in HBSS in two
PCN Enhances Lung Immunity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 September 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e7142

aliquots of 1 ml. Cells recovered in the BALF were counted and
then spun out of the recovered BALF. The recovered fluid was
then stored at 280uC for future use in determining levels of serum
albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and influenza-specific antibody.
Serum albumin and lactate dehydrogenase content of
BALF
The serum albumin content of the BALF was determined by use
of an albumin colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO,
USA). Color absorbency was read at 630 nm and reported in mg/
ml of BALF. The level of LDH detected in the BALF was
determined by colorimetric assay (CytoTox 96, Promega, Madison
WI, USA). The assay absorbance was read at 490 nm and
reported as U/ml in the BALF. Each of the samples was tested in
duplicate.
Depletion of T cell subsets
Depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets was accomplished by
intraperitoneal injection of specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb).
CD4 T cells were depleted by injection of 300 ug of the anti-mouse
CD4 MAb, GK1.5. CD8 T cells were depleted in a similar manner
using the anti-mouse CD8 MAb, TIB 210. Injections of these
monoclonal antibodies were given 24 hours prior to infection and 4
days after infection. Using this method, .95% depletion of the
selected T cell subsets endured for the duration of the experiment.
Both of these MAbs were made in house using in vitro tissue culture.
Determination of influenza-specific antibody levels
Determination of the PR8-specific antibody levels in the serum
and BALF was carried out as described previously [18]. Briefly,
100 ul aliquots of a 1/100 dilution of serum or 100 ul aliquots of
the BALF were added to 96-well high binding polystyrene ELISA
plates that had already been coated with our PR8 influenza viral
membrane preparation and subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat
skim milk. The plates were allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37uC.
Following 3 washes with PBS-Tween, 100 ul of a secondary
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse isotype-specific anti￾body (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham AB) was
added. The plates were then allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37uC.
The presence of bound Ab was detected by the addition of p￾nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer and visualized at
405 nm.
Titration of viral recovery from lungs
Our previously described plaque assay procedure was used in
the experiments reported here [19]. Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions
of the lung homogenates were used to inoculate confluent
monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Following the
inoculation procedure, the assay was then allowed to incubate at
35uC for 3–4 days prior to being fixed in 20% acetic acid and
stained with 0.2% crystal violet to reveal the presence of viral
plaques.
Airway hyperresponsiveness
BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (ova) by intraper￾itoneal injection of 100 ug ova/4 mg alum adjuvant and then
rested 10 days before receiving 5 intranasal 100 ug PCN
instillations over a 2 week period. Five days after the last intranasal
PCN instillation, mice were given an intranasal challenge of 20 ug
ova in PBS for 3 consecutive days. On the following day, Penh
value estimates of airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine
dose response challenges were monitored using a Buxco whole
body plethysmograph.
