Abstract
Background: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to lung transplantation has
greatly increased. However, data regarding the clinical outcomes of this approach are lacking. The objective of this
multicenter prospective observational cohort study was to evaluate lung transplantation outcomes in Korean Organ
Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) patients for whom ECMO was used as a bridge to transplantation.
Methods: Between March 2015 and December 2017, a total of 112 patients received lung transplantation and were
registered in the KOTRY, which is a prospective, multicenter cohort registry. The entire cohort was divided into two
groups: the control group (n = 85, 75.9%) and bridge-ECMO group (n = 27, 24.1%).
Results: There were no significant differences in pre-transplant and intraoperative characteristics except for
poorer oxygenation, more ventilator use, and longer operation time in the bridge-ECMO group. The
prevalence of primary graft dysfunction at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after transplantation did not differ between the
two groups. Although postoperative hospital stays were longer in the bridge-ECMO group than in the control
group, hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups (25.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.212). The majority of
patients (70.4% of the bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of the control group) were discharged directly to their
homes. Finally, the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation did not significantly affect overall survival
and graft function.
Conclusions: Short- and long-term post-transplant outcomes of bridge-ECMO patients were comparable to
recipients who did not receive ECMO.

Background
Lung transplantation has become an accepted treatment
for carefully selected patients with end-stage lung dis￾ease [1, 2]. However, due to a shortage of donors, the
number of patients on waiting lists is growing rapidly
and the average waiting time to lung transplantation has
increased [3, 4]. Given these circumstances, there has
been a corresponding increase in demand for mechanical
ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygen￾ation (ECMO) support to bridge these critically ill
patients to lung transplantation.
MV is associated with risks of ventilator-associated
pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, and
hemodynamic instability [5–8]. Furthermore, recent re￾ports have indicated that waiting for lung transplant￾ation with MV support is a risk factor for increased
mortality compared without MV [9, 10]. Recently, due
to advances in critical care management and improve￾ments in technology regarding the safety profile and
management of ECMO, the use of ECMO as a bridge to
lung transplantation has steadily increased [11–13].
However, bridging to transplantation with ECMO has
also been associated with major complications and in￾creased in-hospital mortality [14, 15]. In addition,
ECMO is invasive, requires anticoagulation for the dur￾ation of therapy, and can be associated with serious
complications [16, 17]. Therefore, concerns remain
about bridging patients with ECMO to lung transplant￾ation. However, most data on lung transplantation after
bridging with ECMO is drawn from retrospective,
single-institution studies, and data describing long-term
outcomes after lung transplantation are limited.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the mortal￾ity and long-term post transplantation outcomes of pa￾tients undergoing lung transplantation after bridging
with ECMO by comparing them with non-bridge￾ECMO patients through an analysis of Korean Organ
Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) data.
Methods
Study design
KOTRY is a prospective, multicenter cohort registry that
includes kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, and lung trans￾plantations in Korea [18]. Lung transplanted patients
from 5 institutions are enrolled in KOTRY. Patients are
enrolled at the time of transplantation and then
followed-up accordingly. Each participating institution
inputs data through a web-based case report form ac￾cording to a standardized protocol. Between March 2015
and December 2017, a total of 112 patients received lung
transplantation and were registered in the KOTRY data￾base. Written informed consent is obtained from each
patient prior to transplantation. If patients are unable to
provide consent due to disease severity, informed
consent is obtained from a relative or legal representa￾tive. This KOTRY study was reviewed and approved by
the Institutional Ethics Committees of each participating
organization.
The clinical data of 112 patients received lung trans￾plantation during study period were followed up until
June 2018. The entire cohort was divided into two
groups: the control group (n = 85) comprised recipients
who did not require ECMO before lung transplantation
and the bridge-ECMO group (n = 27) comprised recipi￾ents who were bridged to lung transplantation with
ECMO. Post-transplant outcomes, including primary
graft dysfunction (PGD) assessed and graded by the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant￾ation lung transplant injury grades [19], functional status
at discharge, graft function, and survival up to 48
months after lung transplantation were assessed.
Data collection and clinical outcomes
Information about transplant recipients, donors, trans￾plant operations, and postoperative follow-up results
were prospectively collected. Data for recipients in￾cluding general demographic information, primary
diagnosis, and pre-transplantation status, and data for
donors including general demographic information,
cause of brain death, and smoking status, were col￾lected. Transplant surgery data including unilateral or
bilateral lung transplantation, operation time, ischemic
time, need for intraoperative hemodynamic support,
and hemodynamic support type were collected.
KOTRY also includes data about post-transplantation
results including immediate complications, need for
organ support, prevalence of primary graft dysfunc￾tion, serial pulmonary function, and outcomes such as
the length of hospital stay, in-hospital and 6-month
mortality, function status at discharge, and co￾morbidities. The most recent information for each
patient was collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
discharge, and then annually. The follow-up data were
collected from patients by the attending physician and
stored using the web-based case report form.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as medians and interquartile
ranges for continuous variables, and as numbers and
percentages for categorical variables. We compared the
clinical characteristics and outcomes of the two groups
using the Mann-Whitney U test or Student’s t-test, as
appropriate, for continuous variables and the chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Prob￾ability of survival curves for each group were estimated
by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log￾rank test. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics
for Windows, version 23.0 (Armonk, NY, USA).

Results
Baseline characteristics
During the study period, a total of 112 patients
underwent lung transplantation and were registered
in KOTRY. The baseline characteristics of the pa￾tients are shown in Table 1. Among them, 71
(63.4%) were male and the median age of all patients
was 58.0 (interquartile range, IQR 52.5–62.0) years.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (53.6%) was the most
common reason for lung transplantation, followed by
connective tissue disease associated interstitial lung
disease (17.9%) and bronchiolitis obliterans after
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (8.9%). One
patient received simultaneous heart-lung transplant￾ation due to Eisenmenger syndrome. All patients
were receiving their first lung transplants. The pre￾transplant oxygenation with partial pressure of
arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen
(FiO2) ratio (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) was 224.0 (IQR
125.0–281.0). Thirty-nine patients (34.8%) received
MV before lung transplantation and all patients in
the bridge-ECMO group received MV simultaneously
before lung transplantation. The median duration of
bridging with ECMO was 11.0 (IQR 6.0–18.0) days
in the bridge-ECMO group. Veno-venous mode (n =
24, 89%) was the most common type of ECMO used
in ECMO-bridge group, followed by veno-venous￾arterial in two and veno-arterial in one. All but four
of cannulation configurations for veno-venous
ECMO was femoro-femoral cannulation.
The median age of donors was 41.5 (IQR 32.0–49.0)
years and the most common cause of brain death was
trauma (33.0%). Forty-six (41.1%) donors were current
smokers. All organs were from deceased donors.

Intra-operation characteristics
The intra-operation characteristics of the enrolled patients
are shown in Table 2. One hundred and eight (96.4%) pa￾tients underwent bilateral lung transplantation. Total
ischemic time for the right lung was 232.0 (IQR 180.0–
338.5) minutes and total ischemic time for the left lung
was 305.0 (IQR 258.0–372.0) minutes. The median oper￾ation time of all patients was 480.0 (IQR 378.0–612.5) mi￾nutes. The median operation time in the bridge-ECMO
group (575.0 min, IQR 474.0–690.0) was longer than in
the control group (455.0 min, IQR 364.0–555.0)
(P < 0.001). Seventy-nine (70.5%) patients required mech￾anical support with ECMO during the operation.
Post-transplantation outcomes
After lung transplantation, immediate complications
developed in 48 (42.9%) patients (Table 3). The most
common immediate complication was infection
(35.4%), followed by post operation bleeding (33.3%).
The frequency of immediate complications was not
different between the bridge-ECMO group and non￾bridge-ECMO group. However, postoperative length
of stay in the intensive care unit was longer in the
bridge-ECMO group (33.0 days, IQR 23.0–43.5) com￾pared with the non-bridge-ECMO group (9.0 days,
IQR 6.0–16.0) (P < 0.001). In addition, the time from
transplantation to hospital discharge was longer in
the bridge-ECMO group (46.0 days, IQR 38.5–68.5)
compared with the non-bridge-ECMO group (35.0
days, IQR 25.0–67.0) (P = 0.030). The hospital mortal￾ity for all patients was 16.4%, with no significant dif￾ference between the two groups (25.9% in bridge￾ECMO group and 13.3% in non-bridge-ECMO group,
P = 0.212). Partially dependent (43.8%) was the most
common functional status at discharge, followed by
fully independent (33.9%), and was not different be￾tween the two groups. The majority of patients
(70.4% of bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of non￾bridge-ECMO group) were discharged to their homes.
Only 5 patients (4.5%) required tracheostomy at
discharge.
As shown in Table 4, the prevalence of PGD was not
significantly different between the bridge-ECMO group
and non-bridge-ECMO group at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h
after lung transplantation (P = 0.255, P = 0.481, P = 0.817,
and P = 0.561 respectively).
Survival rate at 6 months after lung transplantation
was 75.9%, and was not significantly different between
the bridge-ECMO group (66.6%) and non-bridge-ECMO
group (78.8%) (P = 0.304). Bridging with ECMO prior to
lung transplantation did not significantly affect overall
survival (Fig. 1). Although the probability of survival for
the bridge-ECMO group appeared to decrease in the
first few months post-transplantation, this difference was
not statistically significant (P = 0.139, log-rank test). In
addition, there were no significant differences in post￾transplant lung function between the two groups at 3
months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, or 24 months
postoperatively (Fig. 2).
Discussion
In this multicenter prospective observational study, we
found that there were no significant differences in im￾mediate postoperative complications, development and
severity of PGD, functional status at discharge, long￾term survival, or lung function in patients who received
bridging with ECMO compared with the control group,
despite longer operation time, longer ICU stay, and lon￾ger hospitalization after lung transplantation in the
former group.
ECMO support improves outcomes in patients with
life-threatening respiratory failure [11] and the applica￾tion of ECMO as a rescue therapy is expanding in clin￾ical practice [20]. In addition, ECMO has become a
lifesaving intervention for a subset of rapidly deteriorat￾ing patients with end-stage lung disease, which offers
optimizing gas exchange and end-organ perfusion to pa￾tients who might otherwise die before a suitable donor

lung becomes available. Although bridging with ECMO
is generally associated with a greater perioperative risk
and poorer long-term survival [21], ECMO allows
actively deteriorating and severely ill patients with end￾stage lung disease to remain eligible for lung
transplantation.
During the last decade, several studies aimed to evaluate
survival outcomes between bridge-ECMO patients and
non-bridge-ECMO patients to demonstrate the efficacy of
using ECMO as a bridge strategy. Toyoda et al. detected
no survival difference between the bridge-ECMO group
(n = 24) and non-bridge-ECMO group (n = 691) of 74%
versus 83%, respectively, at 1 year after transplantation
[22]. Schechter et al. showed that 1-year survival was not
different between bridge only with ECMO patients and
control patients (70.4% versus 84.2%) [23]. In contrast,
Inci et al. showed worse overall and 3 month conditional
survivals in the bridge-ECMO group (n = 26) versus the
non-bridge-ECMO group (n = 160) (68% versus 85%, p =
0.001; 86% versus 92%, p = 0.03, respectively) [15]. In the
present study, the 6-month mortality of all patients was
24.1% and there was no significant difference between the
bridge-ECMO group and non-bridge-ECMO group in this
respect (33.3 and 21.2%, P = 0.304). The strength of our
study is that recent, multi-institutional data for lung trans￾plantation and a large sample of bridge-ECMO patients
were included. These results indicate that bridging with
ECMO is effective for patients awaiting lung transplant￾ation due to the recent evolution of ICU care and ECMO
management.
In this study, we also provide valuable information
about short-term post transplantation outcomes. Despite
technical improvements, ECMO is associated with risks of
complications including hemolysis and need for transfu￾sion, cardiovascular dysfunction, bleeding due to anticoa￾gulation, and thrombosis formation. Furthermore, ICU
admission for ECMO management leads to ICU-acquired
weakness and infection associated with catheter or ICU
care [24, 25]. Our results indicate that post-operative
bleeding (46.7%) is the most common immediate

complication in bridge-ECMO patients, while infection
(39.4%) is the most common in the non-bridge-ECMO
group, although there were no significant differences
in number of immediate complications after trans￾plantation including post-operative bleeding, infec￾tion, and airway complications between the two
groups. All patients but two showed feasible func￾tional status at discharge and all patients but one
were discharged home in the bridge-ECMO group.
These results indicate that bridging with ECMO is
feasible for patients awaiting lung transplantation by
considering not only survival but also quality of life
after discharge.
In the present study, the long-term outcomes of lung
transplantation after bridging with ECMO were consid￾ered acceptable. KOTRY collects data for each patient
serially at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after discharge, and then an￾nually. However, our analysis includes only 2 years of
follow-up data since the inclusion of lung transplant pa￾tients in KOTRY was initiated only in 2015. Pulmonary
function, including predicted FEV1 and FVC, showed no
significant differences between the bridge-ECMO group
and non-bridge-ECMO group at 3 months, 6 months, 9
months, 12 months, or 24 months follow-up. Co￾morbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and main￾tenance hemodialysis that developed within 2 years after
lung transplantation did not significantly differ between
the two groups. These findings suggest that long-term
prognosis for lung transplant patients after bridge ECMO
is acceptable, if lung transplantation is successful.
Although the results of this study provide additional
information on short- and long-term outcomes of
lung transplantation after bridging with ECMO in a
relatively large sample from a prospective multicenter
registry, the study has several limitations that should
be acknowledged. First, because of the observational Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival after lung transplantation

various biases. We used a national multicenter de￾signed to improve the generalizability of our findings,
but there is a potential risk of selection bias. In
addition, differences in pre-transplantation status be￾tween the two groups should be considered, which
might influence the clinical outcomes. Although the
bridge-ECMO group was more severely ill before
transplantation, however, transplantation outcomes
was comparable. Second, because KOTRY was de￾signed to collect the follow up data of lung trans￾plantation, detailed information on the clinical status
prior to ECMO, ECMO management including case
selection, and rehabilitation prior to transplantation
was not systematically collected. Third, KOTRY in￾cludes a large number of bridge-ECMO patients com￾pared to other studies [26–28]. The high rate of
bridge with ECMO in our study may reflect the Ko￾rean lung allocation system based firstly on urgency
of transplant [28], which is different from the Euro￾pean lung allocation score system based on the ex￾pected benefit after lung transplantation as well as
the disease severity. Under a medical urgency-based
allocation system regardless of post-transplant survival
in Korea, therefore, patients with ECMO on waiting
list are given the highest priority for transplantation.
However, this is what allowed a large number of lung
transplant patients who underwent bridging with
ECMO to be enrolled. Fourth, KOTRY is not the only
source of data regarding lung transplantation in
Korea. Compared with the Korean Network for Organ
Sharing data, only 49% of all patients who received
lung transplantation in Korea during the study period
were registered in the KOTRY. Finally, KOTRY en￾rolls patients at the time of transplantation, and we
were unable to analyze patients who died while wait￾ing for lung transplantation while on ECMO support.
Conclusion
In conclusion, lung transplantation after bridging with
ECMO leads to acceptable patient outcomes. However,
current evidence does not permit firm conclusions re￾garding the efficacy of bridging with ECMO and further
systematic multicenter trials among carefully selected
patients with end-stage lung disease are needed.
