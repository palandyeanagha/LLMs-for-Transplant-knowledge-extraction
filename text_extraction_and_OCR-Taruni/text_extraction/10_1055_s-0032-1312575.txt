Splenic embolization was first performed in 1973 using
autologous clot to treat recurrent gastrointestinal hemor￾rhage arising from esophageal varices.1 Initially, patients
treated with complete splenic embolization had complica￾tions that included abscess, splenic rupture, sepsis, pneumo￾nia, and death.2–5 Six years after this initial report, Spigos et al
treated 13 patients with partial splenic embolization using
antibiotic coverage and postembolization pain control.6 Fol￾lowing the adoption of partial embolization and antibiotic
coverage, multiple case reports and nonrandomized series
reported a reduction in both morbidity and mortality rates
compared with complete splenic embolization.7–15
Current indications for splenic embolization include treat￾ment of portal hypertension and control of splenic hemor￾rhage from trauma or prior to surgical resection. It is also used
to improve platelet counts in patients with idiopathic throm￾bocytopenic purpura, to treat the sequelae of hypersplenism,
and to manage splenic steal syndrome (nonocclusive hepatic
artery hypoperfusion syndrome [NOHAH]) in liver transplant
recipients.16–28 NOHAH syndrome is a controversial diagno￾sis and is discussed separately in this issue of Seminars of
Interventional Radiology.

Splenic Embolization for Portal
Hypertension
In the setting of portal hypertension, splenic embolization
can be used to improve liver function; treat or prevent
variceal hemorrhage; treat hepatic encephalopathy; and
improve red blood cell, leukocyte, and platelet counts.
Liver Function
Since 1986, partial splenic embolization has been noted to
improve liver function tests in cirrhotic patients treated with
partial splenic embolization.29 In 1996, two papers found 12-
month improvements in cholinesterase, cholesterol, total
protein, prothrombin time, and albumin levels in 40 patients
with portal hypertension treated with partial splenic

Abstract Splenic embolization is a technique that can be used alone or in conjunction with other
treatments for the mitigation of portal hypertension and associated physiological
effects of portal hypertension. This technique can be used safely when total emboliza￾tion volume is 50% and the procedural and periprocedural time periods are covered
with antibiotics. In this patient population, partial splenic embolization can decrease the
incidence of variceal bleeding, and protection can persist for at least a year. Additionally,
liver function tests and serum cell counts can be expected to improve. Although not
frequently used as primary therapy for patients with portal hypertension, splenic
embolization can often be helpful as an alternative or adjunctive procedure.

embolization.30,31 Long-term changes in aspartate amino￾transferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in cirrhotic
patients are less clear, with some investigators finding tran￾sient improvement or no significant changes.32–34 The mech￾anism of these changes is not well elucidated but may be
related to increases in hepatic arterial and superior mesen￾teric vasculature blood flow after embolization.35 Porter et al
used a video dilution technique to demonstrate that although
splenic blood flow was reduced from 19% to 3% postembo￾lization, there was a concomitant increase in hepatic arterial
flow from 3% to 15% and an increase in superior mesenteric
blood flow from 6% to 19%.36
Variceal Hemorrhage
Splenic embolization has been used to reduce the incidence
of variceal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension.
Ohmoto et al compared bleeding rates in 52 patients, half of
whom were treated with splenic embolization in addition to
variceal ligation. The addition of splenic embolization re￾duced the rate of rebleeding on follow-up from 39% to 12%.37
Taniai et al compared the recurrence rate for esophageal
variceal bleeding in patients treated with either partial
splenic embolization and ligation, ligation, or sclerotherapy.
Combining partial splenic embolization with ligation re￾duced the 6-month variceal bleeding rate when compared
with ligation alone from 58% to 21%, a result that was
significant and persistent for 2 years of follow-up.38 Pälsson
et al followed 26 severely ill patients treated with partial
splenic embolization for esophageal varices or thrombocyto￾penia, and they demonstrated a mean survival of 50.5
months with significant increases in hemoglobin, leukocyte,
and thrombocyte cell counts.34 Bleeding episode rates sec￾ondary to esophageal varices decreased from 4.3% in the
pretreatment group to 1.1% after partial splenic emboliza￾tion. In a review article, Koconis et al reviewed the English￾language literature between 1973 and 2005 and found five
studies that reported rates of variceal bleeding before and
after splenic artery embolization.39 In the 50 combined
patients, 2.4 episodes of bleeding per year preembolization
was reduced to 0.48 episodes postembolization.39 This effect
can also be seen in patient with both esophageal varices and
portal venous thrombosis with cavernous transformation;
Miyaaki et al demonstrated improvement in both portal vein
thrombus burden and hemoglobin that lasted at least
1 year.40
Hepatic Encephalopathy
There is limited evidence that splenic artery embolization in
conjunction with other treatments may help reduce the
incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Uflacker et al treated
two patients with partial splenic embolization who had
portosystemic shunts, and they demonstrated improve￾ments in encephalopathy.41 The addition of partial splenic
embolization to transportal obliteration and/or balloon ret￾rograde transvenous obliteration of portosystemic shunts
have been shown to have lasting effects on both serum
ammonia levels and encephalopathy grade that persist for
up to 2 years.42
Blood Cell Counts
Splenic embolization has been repeatedly shown to increase
white blood cell, platelet, and red blood cell counts. Increased
serum levels of white blood cells is most likely the result of
decreased splenic pooling, whereas increased erythrocytes
are likely secondary to a combination of a reduction in
episodic hemorrhage and longer red cell lifespan,34,43,44
Elevation in platelet concentration may be multifactorial,
with some improvements mediated through decreased
splenic sequestration and some effects resulting from an
increase in thrombopoietin levels.
Technical Considerations
Our protocol involves preadministration of broad-spectrum
antibiotics prior to the procedure and for up to 2 weeks
postprocedure. Pyrexia or systemic infections are contra￾indications given the increased risk of postprocedural ab￾scess. Common femoral artery access is obtained by palpation
or ultrasound guidance with eventual placement of a 5F
sheath into the iliac system. A C2 catheter, or rarely a reverse
curve catheter, is routinely used to select the celiac axis with
an initial angiogram performed to evaluate the splenic arte￾rial branches as well as the location of pancreatic branches.
Depending on vascular anatomy, a microcatheter system is
used to select the distal main splenic artery or splenic artery
branches for embolization, with postembolization angio￾grams completed from the base catheter. We typically use
500- to 700-μm particles suspended in contrast medium and
embolize 50% of the spleen volume.
We currently administer Pneumovax to patients undergo￾ing splenic embolization, although there is some evidence
this may be unnecessary. Skattum et al compared patients
who received splenectomy or splenic artery embolization
with blood donor controls. In addition to showing an increase
in leukocyte and platelet counts, immunoglobulin and mem￾ory B cells were not affected in the embolization population,
suggesting that immunization may be unnecessary.45
Gelfoam has also been used as an agent for splenic emboli￾zation. Sangro et al used Gelfoam to reduce splenic blood flow
by 40 to 60%, which significantly increased both white blood
cell and platelet counts.46 Additionally, some investigators are
using the Amplatzer plug for proximal splenic embolization.47
Embolization of both the main splenic artery or segmental
branches may be used to reach the target embolization volume.
There is some evidence from the trauma literature that there
may be a slight increase in infarct rate using distal emboliza￾tion and an increase in infectious complications using a more
proximal site.48 However, the likelihood of a repeat emboliza￾tion procedure in portal hypertension patients is not insignifi￾cant; for this reason, we do not perform proximal splenic
artery embolization with permanent agents that would nec￾essarily preclude repeat embolization procedures. Although in
theory we attempt to embolize 50% of the spleen, determining
the degree of splenic embolization is both difficult and highly
subjective. In our experience, embolizing beyond 50% is easy to
do, and for this reason, we perform frequent postembolization
angiograms to assess residual flow (►Figs. 1 and 2).

Postprocedure, routine groin access precautions as well as
immediate access to a patient-controlled analgesic pump are
provided. Routine hospital stays are 24 to 48 hours, with the
patients following up in clinic 1 week postprocedure. Anti￾inflammatory medications (7- to 10-day Medrol dose pack)
are administered as well.
Complications
Most of the patients will have postembolization syndrome
consisting of fever, nausea, and left upper quadrant pain.
These symptoms can usually be controlled with narcotics and
antiemetics. Fever is thought to be secondary to release of
pyrogens from infarcted spleen and may be treated with
steroids.49 Additional minor side effects may include anorex￾ia, pleural effusion, ascites, and ileus, all of which can be
treated symptomatically.
Koconis et al compiled data looking at the serious compli￾cations of splenic embolization procedures.39 These compli￾cations include abscess, pleural effusion, ascites, pneumonia,
pulmonary embolus, portal vein thrombosis, liver failure, and
death. Treatment of pleural effusions and ascites is managed
with thoracentesis and paracentesis, respectively, and are
typically self-limited. Pneumonia and/or atelectasis usually
develop on the left side, which some authors suggest may be
mitigated by focusing embolization in the mid and inferior
poles of the spleen.50,51 Splenic abscess is treated with
percutaneous drainage and follow-up computed tomography
scan, sinogram, and/or drain upsizing or downsizing as the
abscess changes over time. Portal venous thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism can be effectively managed with anti￾coagulation. Depending on the severity of the complication,
subspecialty consultation may be helpful in the management
of more complex cases; however, few cases require surgical
intervention.
Evaluation of these serious complications suggests that
both operator experience and embolization volume may be
related to poor outcome. In 11 patients where the data were
available, 73% had a serious complication when the emboli￾zation volume was 70%.39 Of note, the four deaths reported

since 1990 were in patients who had portal hypertension
secondary to cirrhosis. A rough estimate of mortality rate in
this population from splenic embolization is 1% (compared
with a reported 2.8% mortality from transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt).39,52
Conclusion
Splenic embolization is a technique that can be used alone or
in conjunction with other treatments for the mitigation of
portal hypertension and associated physiological effects of
portal hypertension. This technique can be used safely when
total embolization volume is 50% and the procedural and
periprocedural time periods are covered with antibiotics. In
this patient population, partial splenic embolization can
decrease the incidence of variceal bleeding, and protection
can persist for at least a year. Additionally, liver function tests
and serum cell counts can be expected to improve. Although
not frequently used as primary therapy for patients with
portal hypertension, splenic embolization can often be help￾ful as an alternative or adjunctive procedure.
