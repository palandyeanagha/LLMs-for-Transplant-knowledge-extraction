Abstract
Background: Pathophysiology of life-threatening acute metabolic decompensations (AMD) in propionic acidemia
(PA) and isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is insufficiently understood. Here, we study the metabolomes of
PA and MMA patients over time, to improve insight in which biochemical processes are at play during AMD.
Methods: Longitudinal data from clinical chemistry analyses and metabolic assays over the life-course of 11 PA and
13 MMA patients were studied retrospectively. Direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed on
234 and 154 remnant dried blood spot and plasma samples of PA and MMA patients, respectively. In addition, a
systematic literature search was performed on reported biomarkers. All results were integrated in an assessment of
biochemical processes at play during AMD.
Results: We confirmed many of the metabolite alterations reported in literature, including increases of plasma
valine and isoleucine during AMD in PA patients. We revealed that plasma leucine and phenylalanine, and urinary
pyruvic acid were increased during AMD in PA patients. 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid correlated positively with plasma
ammonia. We found that known diagnostic biomarkers were not significantly further increased, while intermediates
of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation pathway were significantly increased during AMD.
Conclusions: We revealed that during AMD in PA and MMA, BCAA and BCAA intermediates accumulate, while
known diagnostic biomarkers remain essentially unaltered. This implies that these acidic BCAA intermediates are
responsible for metabolic acidosis. Based on this, we suggest to measure plasma 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and
urinary ketones or 3-hydroxybutyric acid for the biochemical follow-up of a patient’s metabolic stability.

Introduction
Propionic acidemia (PA) and isolated methylmalonic
acidemia (MMA) are disorders affecting the catabolic
pathway of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) L￾isoleucine and L-valine, and the amino acids L-threonine
and L-methionine. PA is caused by a deficiency of
propionyl-CoA carboxylase (encoded by PCCA and
PCCB), and isolated MMA is either caused by a defi￾ciency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, methylmalonyl￾CoA epimerase or by a defect in the metabolism of the
cofactor of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, 5′-deoxyadeno￾sylcobalamin (encoded by MUT, MCEE, MMAA, MMAB
or MMADHC, respectively).
The clinical course of PA and MMA is characterized
by life-threatening acute metabolic decompensations
(AMD). Clinically, AMD result in lethargy, anorexia,
vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia, Kussmaul breathing
and potentially coma and even death. Biochemically,
AMD are characterized by hyperammonemia, metabolic
acidosis with a high anion gap and lactic acidosis [1, 2].
AMD are held responsible for the neurological deficits
that patients present with, such as psychomotor retard￾ation, cognitive impairment, movement disorders and
epilepsy [3].
AMD are thought to arise as a result of a catabolic
stressor, which induces protein catabolism and increases
the load of toxic metabolites, causing clinical distress.
However, despite increasing knowledge on specific me￾tabolite alterations during these decompensations,
pathophysiology of AMD is not entirely understood.
Plasma ammonia for example, is considered the best
available biochemical read-out of AMD, but does not
provide insight in other pathophysiological processes
that may occur during AMD. Increased insight in the
exact pathophysiological events during AMD could po￾tentially pave the way towards optimized clinical care
and better neurological outcomes [4, 5].
To increase pathophysiological understanding of
AMD, we here study the metabolomes throughout life of
24 PA and MMA patients. Hereto, longitudinal results
from targeted biochemical assays and from untargeted
metabolomics were analyzed, and integrated with the re￾sults of a systematic search for biomarkers reported in
literature.
Materials and methods
Patient inclusion
Patients were eligible for inclusion when PA or isolated
MMA was enzymatically or genetically confirmed (pa￾tients with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homo￾cystinuria were excluded), and when targeted metabolic
analyses had been performed or when remnant samples
were available at the University Medical Centre Utrecht.
All 24 included patients or their legal guardians provided
written approval for the analysis of their medical records
and the use of their remnant samples for this research.
All procedures followed were in accordance with the
ethical standards of the University Medical Centre Ut￾recht (17–490/C) and with the Helsinki Declaration of
1975, as revised in 2000.
Eleven patients were diagnosed with PA and 13 with
MMA, of whom four were nonresponsive and nine were
responsive to cobalamin supplementation (Table 1). Me￾dian age at follow-up was 17.9 and 11.9 years for PA and
MMA patients, respectively (Table 1). Three PA patients
and one MMA patient died (Table 1). Patients were
treated in line with current treatment protocols [3].
Targeted biochemical analyses
Available results of all targeted analyses performed
throughout the patient’s life in the clinical chemical la￾boratory and in the metabolic diagnostic laboratory of
the University Medical Centre Utrecht were systematic￾ally retrieved (Table 1).
Untargeted biochemical analyses: direct-infusion high￾resolution mass spectrometry
Blood samples were drawn and stored as described be￾fore [6]. DI-HRMS was performed on 234 remnant DBS
and plasma samples of PA patients and on 154 remnant
DBS and plasma samples of MMA patients (Table 1), as
described before [6]. DI-HRMS analysis resulted in the
identification of 1905 mass peaks that could be anno￾tated as 3929 metabolites that are expected to occur en￾dogenously. For each mass peak per patient sample, the
deviation from the intensities in the 30 control samples
was indicated by a Z-score [6]. Z-scores were calculated
for both patient and control samples and were consid￾ered aberrant when > 2.0 or < − 1.5.
Data analysis
A sample was classified as ‘no AMD’ when the sample
was obtained at an outpatient, scheduled visit that did
not result in hospitalization. A sample was classified as
‘AMD’ when the sample was drawn on the first day of
admission, when the patient was hospitalized for an
(impending) AMD. All other samples, for example sam￾ples drawn during hospitalizations but not on the first
day, were considered neither ‘no AMD’ nor ‘AMD’
(Table 1).
To identify diagnostic biomarkers in targeted analyses,
a metabolite was considered a biochemical disease
marker when the median was below the lower limit of
the reference range (RR), or above the upper limit of the
RR. For DI-HRMS, Mann-Whitney U tests were per￾formed comparing samples classified as ‘no AMD’ to
control samples, for PA and MMA separately.

To identify metabolites associated with metabolic in￾stability, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed com￾paring samples classified as ‘AMD’ with samples
classified as ‘no AMD’, for both PA and MMA separ￾ately. In addition, Spearman correlation tests were per￾formed comparing concentrations and Z-scores of every
measured metabolite in every patient in this study to
plasma ammonia concentrations.
P-values were adjusted according to the Bonferroni
method, and considered statistically significant when <
0.05. R2 values were considered biologically relevant
when > 0.50 or < − 0.50. Data analysis was performed in
R programming language. Data and R code are available
on request.
Supervised clustering analyses were performed using
the software of MetaboAnalyst 4.0 [7]. Z-score tables
with unpaired samples in columns were uploaded. No
missing value estimation, data filtering or normalization
was performed. The analysis paths ‘Partial Least Squares
– Discriminant Analysis’ (PLS-DA) including the 2D
scores plot and the variable importance in projection
score, and heatmaps were analyzed.
Literature study
To obtain an overview on known diagnostic biomarkers
and on biochemical parameters reported to be associated
with AMD in PA and MMA, we performed an extensive
literature search [4, 5]. All reports discussing biomarkers
were systematically evaluated and results were tabulated
in Table S1 [1, 2, 8–31]. This table lists, to the best of our
knowledge, the first reports of diagnostic biomarkers, of
biochemical parameters associated with the presence of
AMD and of biochemical parameters that correlate with
plasma ammonia in PA and MMA [1, 2, 8–31].
Integration of findings reported in literature and study
results
Findings reported in the reviewed literature as listed in
Table S1 [1, 2, 8–31] were combined with the results ob￾tained in this study and visualized in an overview of the
catabolic pathway of L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-threonine
and L-methionine, derived from Fig. 1 and 2 of Haijes
et al. 2019 [5], to obtain an overview of the all known
metabolite alterations during AMD in PA and MMA.
For each of the alterations, the significance for the
pathophysiology of AMD was assessed.
Since we did not quantify propionyl-CoA or acetyl￾CoA, propionylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine were used
as proxy to estimate these concentrations. In healthy in￾dividuals, acetylcarnitine is 10-fold higher than propio￾nylcarnitine (RR 0.7–9.7 μmol/L for acetylcarnitine, RR
0.0–0.8 μmol/L for propionylcarnitine). Extrapolation of
these concentrations suggests that the C2/C3 ratio in
healthy individuals approximates 10. The C2/C3 ratio in
PA and MMA patients was calculated based on targeted
quantification of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine.
Results
Confirmation of metabolite alterations already reported
in literature
Targeted metabolic assays in the included samples con￾firmed abnormalities in 13 diagnostic biomarkers re￾ported in the reviewed literature, of which six are shared
between PA and MMA, three were only observed in PA
patients and four were only observed in MMA patients
(Table S2, Figure S1). Untargeted DI-HRMS confirmed
six disease biomarkers, three of which are shared be￾tween PA and MMA, two were only observed in PA pa￾tients and one was only observed in MMA patients
(Table S2, Figure S2-S3). PLS-DA of untargeted DI￾HRMS data from both DBS and plasma confirmed pro￾pionylcarnitine, propionylglycine, glycine, 3-
dehydroxycarnitine and 2-methylcitric acid as bio￾markers for PA (Figure S4-S11), and methylmalonic
acid, propionylcarnitine, glycine, 2-methylcitric acid, 3-
dehydroxycarnitine and methylmalonyl-carnitine as bio￾markers for MMA (Figure S12-S17).
With respect to the samples obtained during AMD,
clinical chemistry tests confirmed that urea was in￾creased in MMA patients (Table 2, Figure S18-S19) and
that ammonia was increased in PA patients (Table 2,
Figure S18, S20). Targeted metabolic assays confirmed
the increases of valine and isoleucine, the decreases of glu￾tamine, citrulline and free carnitine in plasma, and the in￾crease of lactic acid and 3-hydroxybutyric acid in urine, in
PA patients during AMD (Table 2, Figure S21-S29).
Untargeted DI-HRMS confirmed 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid
(10 isomers) as a biochemical marker increased during
AMD in PA patients (Table 2, Figure S30-S31). Targeted
metabolic assays and untargeted DI-HRMS disclosed that
2-methylcitric acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid and propio￾nylglycine correlated positively with plasma ammonia
(Table 3, Figure S32-S33).
Identification of novel metabolite alterations
Targeted analysis of amino acids revealed that histidine was
significantly decreased in (treated) PA patients and glutam￾ine was significantly decreased in (treated) MMA patients
(Table S2, Figure S1, S24, S34). Histidine was also relatively
decreased in MMA, and glutamine in PA, although the me￾dians were not below the lower limit of the RR (Table S2,
Figure S1, S24, S34). Untargeted DI-HRMS showed that
histidine and glutamine were significantly decreased in both
PA and MMA patients (Table S2, Figure S2). In addition,
untargeted DI-HRMS unveiled 17 unreported potential
diagnostic biomarkers (Table S2, Figure S2-S3) including
increased lysoPC (15:0) (2 isomers), lysoPC (17:0) (2 iso￾mers) and 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid, especially

in PA patients, and increased propionic acid (2 isomers) in
MMA patients (Table S2, Figure S35-S39). PLS-DA of
untargeted DI-HRMS data from both DBS and plasma con￾firmed 2-amino-3-phosphopropionic acid and lysoPC (15:
0) as biomarkers for PA, and propionic acid as biomarker
for MMA (Figure S4, S12), supporting that these three me￾tabolites could serve as diagnostic biomarkers.
Investigation of biochemical parameters associated with
AMD disclosed that urea, as already reported for MMA,
was increased in PA patients during AMD (Table 2,
Figure S18-S19). In addition, glucose was slightly in￾creased in both PA and MMA patients (Table 2,
Figure S18, S20) and ionized calcium was decreased
in PA patients during AMD (Table 2, Figure S18).
Targeted metabolic assays uncovered six unreported
biochemical parameters altered during AMD in PA
patients.
Leucine and phenylalanine in plasma and pyruvic acid
in urine were increased (Table 2, Figure S21, S39-S42),
and C8- and C10-carnitine in plasma and homovanillic
acid were decreased (Table 2, Figure S21). Untargeted
DI-HRMS revealed an increase of acetylcysteine and cor￾tisol, and a normalization of fructoseglycine during
AMD in PA patients (Table 2), but PLS-DA of untar￾geted DI-HRMS data from both DBS and plasma dem￾onstrated that AMD could not be distinguished clearly
from no AMD, based on the patients’ metabolomes
(Figure S43-S44).
Both targeted metabolic assays and untargeted DI￾HRMS showed that 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid correlated
positively with plasma ammonia (Table 3, Figure S30-
S33). In addition, two biochemical parameters for mito￾chondrial disease were found to negatively correlate with
ammonia: alanine/lysine ratio and alanine/(phenylalani￾ne+tyrosine) ratio (Table 3, Figure S32).
Integration of findings reported in literature and study
results
Metabolite alterations during AMD, either reported in
the reviewed literature or reported here, are visualized in
Fig. 1. Contrary to what is often expected, diagnostic
biomarkers such as propionylglycine, propionylcarnitine,
methylmalonylcarnitine, propionic acid and methylmalo￾nic acid remained essentially unaltered during AMD
(Fig. 1 – Part 2, Table 4), although for methylmalonic
acid, the non-significant test results could be due to the
small number of samples drawn during AMD (n = 2,
Table 4). Rather, AMD appeared to induce an increase
of BCAA and BCAA intermediates, all upstream metab￾olites of propionyl-CoA (Fig. 1 – Part 1). Based on this
observation, we propose that the acidic BCAA interme￾diates are responsible for the metabolic acidosis in PA
and MMA patients during AMD.
Interestingly, intermediates of the leucine degradation
pathway were elevated as well, even though leucine is not
degraded via propionyl-CoA (Fig. 1 – Part 1). The increase
of leucine and 2-oxoisocaproate could be explained by in￾hibition of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase
complex (BCKDC) by -CoA esters, including propionyl￾CoA [2, 32]. BCKDC is the rate-limiting enzyme in the
BCAA catabolism pathway and is responsible for the irre￾versible step that converts branched-chain α-ketoacids into
isobutyryl-CoA, 2-methyl-butyryl-CoA and isovaleryl-CoA.
Increases of valine and isoleucine, as well as increases of 2-
oxoisovalerate and 2-oxo-methylvalerate, have also been ex￾plained by inhibition of BCKDC (Fig. 1 – Part 1). However,
inhibition of BCKDC cannot explain all reported increases
of BCAA intermediates. Reasons for accumulation of
metabolites downstream of BCKDC, such as 3-
hydroxyisovaleric acid, 2-methyl-butyric acid and 3-methyl￾glutaconic acid await further elucidation.
Next, the increase of plasma ammonia, and the relative
decrease of plasma citrulline can be explained as follows.
Propionyl-CoA inhibits N-acetylglutamate synthase and
consequently, there is a lack of stimulation of carba￾moylphosphate synthase [33]. This process might be ag￾gravated by the relative decrease of acetyl-CoA and
glutamine (Fig. 1 – Part 2). The result is decreased de￾toxification of ammonia [33] and also a relative lack of
carbamoylphosphate. As carbamoylphosphate is the pre￾cursor of citrulline, we hypothesize that the observed de￾crease of plasma citrulline is caused by hampered
citrulline formation by ornithine transcarbamylase
(Fig. 1 – Part 2).

Downstream consequences of accumulation
propionyl-CoA appear to be centered around a relative
shortage of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1 – Part 3). The median
value of propionylcarnitine is five-fold higher than the
median value of acetylcarnitine (Table 4) in PA and
MMA patients. Hence, the C2/C3 carnitine ratio, which
we use as proxy for the ratio of acetyl-CoA over
propionyl-CoA, approximates 0.5, which is a 20-fold de￾crease compared to healthy individuals. We hypothesize
that as a consequence of this relative shortage, the high
levels of propionyl-CoA compete with the relatively low
levels of acetyl-CoA for citrate synthase, resulting in for￾mation of excessive amounts of 2-methylcitric acid
formed from propionyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, rather
than citrate (Fig. 1 – Part 3). Reduced conversion of
acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate into citrate could augment,
in turn, depletion of citric acid cycle intermediates, po￾tentially causing an energy deficiency (Fig. 1 – Part 3).
To replenish the citric acid cycle, we hypothesize that
two different routes are being utilized. Firstly, in line with
others, we hypothesize that glutamine, and possibly glu￾tamate, might be used to replenish α-ketoglutarate, and
that for this reason glutamine is decreased [1, 2, 28, 34]
(Fig. 1 – Part 3). Secondly, alanine might be used for ana￾plerosis as well. In combination with a propionyl-CoA in￾duced decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase [5]

this could result in the observed increase of both pyruvate
and lactate (Fig. 1 – Part 3), which could explain the ob￾served lactic acidosis.
Discussion
Through an extensive literature study and a longitudinal
analysis of the metabolomes of a cohort of PA and
MMA patients, we revealed that during AMD, BCAA
and BCAA intermediates accumulate, while known diag￾nostic biomarkers remain essentially unaltered. This im￾plies that these acidic metabolites are responsible for
metabolic acidosis. In addition, we speculated that
downstream consequences of accumulating propionyl￾CoA are centered around a relative shortage of acetyl￾CoA, potentially resulting in depletion of citric acid cycle
intermediates and thereby explaining the observed en￾ergy deficiency in PA and MMA patients. A relative
shortage of acetyl-CoA could also explain the decrease
of glutamine, decrease of alanine and the increases of
pyruvate and lactate, thereby explaining the observed
lactic acidosis.
Biochemical analyses to perform during AMD
This study presents an overview of what is currently
known on the biochemical processes during AMD in PA
and MMA. More insight in the metabolic stability of a
patient at a certain point in time can be attained by
measuring plasma ammonia and lactate, pH, pCO2, bi￾carbonate and base excess. To improve insight in the
metabolic consequences of AMD, we suggest to measure
2-methylcitric acid and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid in
plasma, as these parameters are significantly correlated
to plasma ammonia and since 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is
significantly increased during AMD. In addition, we sug￾gest to measure urinary ketones – which is already com￾mon practice by many clinicians – or specifically urinary
3-hydroxybutyric acid, as this metabolite is also signifi￾cantly increased during AMD. Altogether, quantification
of these markers could increase insight in the patient’s
current metabolic stability. Conversely, we conclude that
quantification of diagnostic biomarkers does not con￾tribute to insight in the current metabolic stability of a
patient.
Although concentrations were often still in the normal
range, isoleucine, valine and leucine, as well as glutam￾ine, citrulline and alanine could also be determined in
times of AMD, as a trend analysis on an individual pa￾tient basis could increase insight in the biochemical pro￾cesses during AMD in that patient. In addition, we
advise to determine free carnitine concentrations to
monitor whether carnitine supplementation is sufficient
during AMD, as free carnitine is relatively decreased
during AMD.
Therapeutic interventions during AMD
Since free carnitine is relatively decreased during AMD,
increasing free carnitine might improve scavenging of
propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. This could be
achieved by emergency (increase of) carnitine supple￾mentation, possibly in a much earlier stage than at the
time of hospital admission.
In addition, during AMD there is also a significant de￾crease of plasma citrulline, although the lack of citrulline
is not as distinct as in urea cycle disorders. We speculate
that citrulline supplementation, as provided during
AMD in urea cycle disorders as N-acetylglutamate syn￾thase deficiency, carbamoyl phosphate synthase I defi￾ciency and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency to
maximize ammonia excretion through the urea cycle
[35], might also contribute to ammonia detoxification in
severely decompensated PA and MMA patients, but this
hypothesis requires further study.
Potential novel diagnostic biomarkers
Untargeted DI-HRMS revealed four metabolites that
could potentially be new diagnostic biomarkers for PA
and MMA. However, as diagnosing PA and MMA is
often quite straightforward, the added value of these four
metabolic markers for diagnostic purposes is limited.
Though, these markers could point towards important
pathophysiological processes in PA and MMA, and
thereby they could potentially serve as markers for cer￾tain disease conditions, such as long-term metabolic
control or neurological damage.
Firstly, lysoPC (15:0) and lysoPC (17:0), phospholipids
with an odd-chain tail, were unveiled as potential disease
biomarkers, especially in PA patients. It has been re￾ported that increased intracellular concentration of
propionyl-CoA leads to a relative abundance of odd￾numbered long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in body lipids,
for example in erythrocyte membrane lipids. These odd￾numbered LCFA seem to be increased even higher in
patients with a more severe clinical course [36]. It has
been hypothesized that odd-numbered LCFA are a re￾flection of continuous burden of propionyl-CoA toxicity
within the cells, and that this might serve as a reliable
tool for evaluating the quality of the long-term metabolic
control [37]. In line with this, we observed that lysoPC
(15,0) and lysoPC (17,0) were higher in patients that ex￾perienced AMD more frequently.
Secondly, in PA patients, 2-amino-3-phosphonopro￾pionic acid (AP3) was found to be increased. It could
not be distinguished whether this increase was caused by
L-AP3, D-AP3 or a combination thereof. Yuan et al.
found that D-AP3 does not induce any neurotoxic ef￾fects [38], but, in contrast, that L-AP3 is a stereoselective
metabotropic excitatory glutamate receptor antagonist
that blocks activation of excitatory glutamate receptors
Haijes et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2020) 15:68 Page 10 of 13

[38] and thereby increases activity of the N-acetyl-D-as￾partate receptor [38–40]. Activation of the N-acetyl-D￾aspartate receptor by propionic acid and methylmalonic
acid has been described as an important pathophysio￾logical process in inducing apoptosis of neurons and
thereby causing neurological complications in PA and
MMA [4, 5, 41], although the exact cascade is not fully
understood. L-AP3 could be an intermediate in this
process. This is further supported by a study demon￾strating that intracaudatal injection of L-AP3 in rats
caused a neurotoxic effect, characterized by vasogenic
brain edema and neuronal degeneration, processes that
are also described in PA and MMA [4]. An N-acetyl-D￾aspartate receptor antagonist attenuated this effect. Al￾though a potential role of L-AP3 in inducing neural de￾generation is interestingly, this is still speculative.
Thirdly, a metabolite with a molecular weight corre￾sponding to propionic acid and its endogenous isomers
lactaldehyde and hydroxyacetone and its exogenous iso￾mers ethyl formate, 3-hydroxypropanal and methyl acet￾ate, was found to be markedly increased in MMA.
Unexpectedly, this feature was not increased in PA.
However, for none of the possible annotations of this m/
z, a role in MMA but not in PA could be hypothesized.
Since a very consistent correlation between methylmalo￾nic acid and this metabolite was identified, both in DBS
and plasma, especially for Z-scores > 50, we hypothesize
that this metabolite could be a potential biomarker for
MMA, and that this yet unannotated compound is a de￾rivative of methylmalonic acid.
Limitations and strengths
An important limitation of this study, inherent to studying
rare diseases, is the limited sample cohort (Table 1). Al￾most all samples were drawn during dietary and/or
pharmacological treatment, complicating pathophysio￾logical interpretation. In addition, identification of meta￾bolic markers characterizing AMD was affected by a
smaller sample size, especially for MMA, for which no sig￾nificant results were obtained for both targeted and untar￾geted analyses. Also, due to the retrospective design,
samples were not obtained for every patient at similar
time points. Moreover, our limited understanding of
metabolic stability in PA and MMA patients impeded
classification of samples as drawn during AMD or in times
of metabolic stability. This may have contributed to the
fact that we were not able to detect metabolic markers
that could clearly distinguish AMD from no AMD. Fur￾thermore, interpretation of historical data was affected by
methodological developments, leading to different assays
performed to quantify one metabolite, for example for 2-
methylcitric acid. Lastly, the fact that due to direct￾infusion an observed mass can account for multiple me￾tabolite annotations, hampered solid conclusions on for
example L-AP3 as potential biomarker for PA patients,
and a metabolite with an m/z corresponding to propionic
acid as potential biomarker for MMA patients. Therefore,
the implications of these findings remain to be further
elucidated.
Due to the limited sample size and variation in assays
performed at each time point, we were not able to calcu￾late the fraction of the anion gap of the accumulating
BCAA intermediates during an AMD. To test our hy￾pothesis that accumulation of BCAA intermediates is re￾sponsible for metabolic acidosis during AMD, we
suggest to determine the fraction of the anion gap of
BCAA intermediates during AMD in a prospective
study.
Despite these limitations, important strengths of this
study are that historical, longitudinal results from both
clinical chemistry and targeted metabolic assays were
combined with untargeted analyses in remnant samples,
in order to search for potential disease biomarkers as
broad as possible. Our approach accurately verified the
findings of previous studies and we identified potentially
novel diagnostic biomarkers for both PA and MMA. By
combining our results with an extensive literature search
on biomarkers for PA and MMA during AMD, we gen￾erated new hypotheses regarding which biochemical pro￾cesses could be at play in the pathophysiology of AMD
in PA and MMA.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we here verify and expand reported find￾ings on altered metabolites during AMD in PA and
MMA. We illustrate in detail what could be important
pathophysiological processes during AMD. Based on our
findings, we propose that accumulating acidic BCAA in￾termediates may be held responsible for inducing meta￾bolic acidosis during AMD, instead of propionic acid
and methylmalonic acid, which are essentially unaltered
during AMD.
