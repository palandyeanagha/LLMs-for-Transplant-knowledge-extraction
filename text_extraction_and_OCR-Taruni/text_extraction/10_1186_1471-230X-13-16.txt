patients’ perspective: a survey in 5 countries
Jeffrey Vietri1*, Girish Prajapati2 and Antoine C El Khoury3
Abstract
Background: Few studies have examined the impact of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on patient reported
outcomes in Europe. This study was conducted to assess the burden of HCV infection in terms of work productivity
loss, activity impairment, health-related quality of life, healthcare resource utilization, and associated costs.
Methods: The 2010 European National Health and Wellness Survey (n = 57,805) provided data. Patients reporting
HCV infection in France, Germany, the UK, Italy, and Spain were matched to respondents without HCV using
propensity scores. Outcome measures included the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire
and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12v2) questionnaire. Subgroup analyses focused on
treatment-naïve patients.
Results: HCV Patients (n = 286) had more work impairment (30% vs. 18%, p < .001), more impairment in non-work
activities (34% vs. 28%, p < .05), and more annual physician visits per patient (19.8 vs. 13.3, p < .001). Estimated
indirect and direct costs were €2,956 (p < .01) and €495 (p < .001) higher than in matched controls, respectively.
Health-related quality of life was also lower among HCV patients. Treatment-naïve HCV patients (n = 139) also
reported higher work impairment (29% vs. 15%, p < .01), as well as more frequent physician visits (19.5 vs. 12.1,
p < .01) than matched controls. Each treatment-naïve HCV infected patient incurred €934 in direct costs vs. €508
(p < .01 in matched controls. Employed treatment-naïve patients reported higher productivity loss per year
compared to matched controls (€6,414 vs. €3,642, p < .05).
Conclusion: HCV infection in Europe is associated with considerable economic and humanistic burden. This is also
true of diagnosed patients who have never been treated for HCV.

Background
An estimated 160 million people are chronically infected
with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide [1]. Approxi￾mately 9 million have HCV infection in Europe, with
greater prevalence in the southern and eastern regions
[2-6]. While the incidence of new cases is low, few
patients exposed to the virus spontaneously clear the in￾fection, so exposure typically results in chronic infection
that will continue indefinitely. Many chronically infected
patients do not know that they have been infected with
HCV, as infection is largely asymptomatic [7].
Though chronic HCV infection does not always cause
serious health consequences, patients are at greater risk
for development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocel￾lular carcinoma (HCC), all of which are associated with
high morbidity and mortality [8,9]. HCV infection is the
most common indication for liver transplantation in
Europe, and HCV infection of the transplanted liver is
common. HCV was estimated to have caused more than
86,000 deaths in Europe in 2002 [4], a figure expected to
increase as the patient population reaches the age at
which long-term consequences of chronic infection typ￾ically manifest [4,10-12].
The goal of treatment for HCV is sustained virologic
response (SVR), when the virus cannot be detected in
the blood six months after the end of treatment. Patients
who achieve SVR are at much lower risk for cirrhosis
and HCC than those who do not achieve virological cure
[13]. However, treatment with pegylated interferon and

ribavirin is often unsuccessful, and is associated with ad￾verse events and patient burden during the course of
treatment [14-16]. Newly developed treatments for HCV
infection are expected to dramatically increase the rate
of SVR [17], and determining whether novel treatments
are cost effective requires an assessment of the burden
of HCV infection, including the economic impact as well
as any impairment of quality of life.
Research using the US National Health and Wellness
Survey (NHWS) has documented a significant burden of
HCV infection on work productivity, with infected
respondents missing approximately 9% of working hours
in the last week, and reporting an average of 27% im￾pairment while at work [18], and a database study found
that HCV infected patients were 7.5% less productive
based on work units per hour [19]. HCV is also asso￾ciated with increased use of healthcare resources and
increased direct healthcare costs [19-24]. The estimates
of healthcare resource use vary greatly. DiBonventura
et al. reported approximately 30% more physician visits
among patients with diagnosed HCV infection than
among propensity matched controls, with a similar trend
for emergency room (ER) visits [24]. Database studies
looking at costs in the year following diagnosis of HCV
infection have found even larger differences. Davis et al.
found that all-cause healthcare claims in HCV infected
patients were, on average, almost US$21,000 in the year
after diagnosis, nearly four times that in age, gender, and
plan-matched controls [20], while McCombs et al. found
an average cost of over US$37,000 in the year following
diagnosis, which represents an incremental cost of more
than US$23,000 [22]. Impaired health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) in HCV population has also been docu￾mented [24-26]. However, almost all of these studies
have focused on the US population, with very few stud￾ies describing the burden among HCV infected patients
in Europe [26,27], and none from a patient perspective
using a representative sample.
The objective of this study was to quantify the burden
of HCV infection with respect to work productivity,
healthcare resource use, related monetary cost to society,
impairment in non-work activities, and HRQoL using a
broadly representative sample of European adults.
Methods
The National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS;
Kantar Health, New York, NY, USA), is an annual,
cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or older,
with 57,805 respondents across France, Germany, Italy,
Spain, and the UK in 2010. The NHWS is a self￾administered survey which includes questions regarding
diagnosed medical conditions, experience with over-the￾counter and prescription medical treatments, health￾related outcomes, as well as health-related attitudes and
behaviors. Heath outcomes, including work productivity,
impairment in activities of daily living, and HRQoL are
assessed by validated scales (discussed below), and
patients self-report the type and number of healthcare
resources used during the six months preceding the sur￾vey. Potential respondents to the NHWS are recruited
through an existing consumer panel selected by using
opt-in emails, co-registration with panel partners, e￾newsletter campaigns, and online banner placements.
All panelists must explicitly agree to be a panel member,
register with the panel through a unique email address,
and complete an in-depth demographic registration pro￾file. The sample is generated through stratified random
sampling within this panel, with quotas based on gender
and age to ensure the final sample is representative of
each country’s adult (18 years of age and older) popula￾tion. The 2010 NHWS was approved by Essex Institutional
Review Board (Lebanon, NJ, USA), and all respondents
provided informed consent.
For the present analysis, patients reporting Hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection, HIV, or AIDS were excluded to
ensure that any burden documented in the HCV group
was not due to HCV-associated comorbidities rather
than the HCV itself. Likewise, because HCV infected
patients are likely to differ from individuals without
HCV in ways that may affect the outcomes measured by
the survey, a propensity scoring methodology was
employed to match each HCV infected patient with a
single member of the control group [28]. Country of
residence, age, gender, sexual orientation (heterosexual,
homosexual, bisexual, or decline to answer), education
(high school graduate vs. below), income (above or
below median for country), number of non-liver comor￾bidities, smoking (yes/no), exercise (yes vs. no), alcohol
use (yes vs. no), and BMI (underweight, normal weight,
overweight, obese, or decline to answer) were included
in a logistic regression to predict a self-reported phys￾ician diagnosis of HCV infection. The estimates resulting
from this regression—the propensity scores—indicated
how likely each HCV patient and non-HCV respondent
was to have HCV given their demographic and health
characteristics. The widely-used greedy matching algo￾rithm was used to match each HCV patient to a single
non-HCV control in the same country whose propensity
score most closely matched the patent’s score [29].
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)
questionnaire was used to measure the impact of health on
work performance [30]. The WPAI is a 6-item validated in￾strument that consists of four metrics: absenteeism (the
percentage of work time missed because of one’s health),
presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced
while at work because of one’s health), overall work prod￾uctivity loss (an overall impairment estimate that is a com￾bination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity

impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activ￾ities because of one’s health). The recall period for all items
is seven days. Only respondents who reported being
employed full-time, employed part-time, or self-employed
were shown the items assessing absenteeism, presenteeism,
and overall work impairment, but all respondents provided
data for activity impairment. Absenteeism was calculated
by dividing the number of work hours a patient missed in
the past week because of his or her health by the total
number of hours a patient could have worked (the number
of hours he/she did work plus the number of hours missed
because of his/her health). Presenteeism was computed
from patient’s rating of his or her level of impairment
experienced while at work in the past 7 days on a scale
from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (completely unable to func￾tion), which was then divided by 10 to create a percentage,
with a range from 0% to 100%. Overall work impairment
was measured by adding absenteeism and presenteeism to
determine the total percentage of lost work time. Activity
impairment was derived from patient’s rating of the level of
impairment experienced in daily activities in the past 7 days
on a scale from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (completely un￾able to function), which was then divided by 10 to create a
percentage, with a range from 0 to 100%.
The 2010 NHWS also asked respondents about their use
of healthcare resources over the preceding six months.
Items included were the number of visits to healthcare pro￾viders and emergency room (ER), and hospitalization for
the patient’s own medical condition. Healthcare providers
include general practitioner/family practitioners, internists
and dentists as well as more specialized physicians. The
reported values were doubled to obtain an annual estimate.
We estimated direct healthcare costs for each NHWS re￾spondent, and indirect costs for each employed respondent.
Direct costs were estimated by multiplying the annualized
healthcare resource use by the average cost of that service
reported in the literature [31], then adjusting for inflation
using the Harmonized Consumer Prices Index to 2010
values [32]. Indirect costs were estimated by projecting
each patient’s absenteeism and presenteeism into an esti￾mate of hours of lost productivity per year. Lost hours were
then multiplied by an estimated hourly wage for each re￾spondent. Hourly wages for all employed respondents (full￾time, part-time, and self-employed) were calculated using
the median wage of full-time workers using the most
recently available (2006) personal income figures from
Eurostat for full-time employees in each country [33].
These were inflated to 2010 values by inflating them
according to the percentage rise in adjusted household in￾come in each country from 2006 to 2010 as reported by
Eurostat for the continental European countries, and by the
rise in personal income from 2006–2010 for the UK as
reported by the Office of National Statistics. The yearly
wage was divided by the number of weeks typically worked
each year to estimate the weekly value of the individual’s
labor while at work. This weekly figure was then divided by
the number of hours in a work week to create an hourly es￾timate. Figures for weeks and hours worked were obtained
from the European Foundation for the Improvement of
Living and Working Conditions [34].
The Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form
Survey Instrument (SF-12v2) was used to assess HRQoL
[35]. The instrument is designed to accurately report on
eight health concepts (physical functioning, role phys￾ical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function￾ing, role emotional, and mental health) using the fewest
questions possible. The SF-12 questions were selected
from the widely used SF-36 health survey. The SF-12
allows calculation of physical component summary
(PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores
comparable to the ones calculated from SF-36. The
present analysis included the PCS and MCS norm￾based scores, which are scaled to have a mean of 50 and
a standard deviation of 10 in the US population. Conse￾quently, a 3 to 5-point difference is typically considered
clinically significant [36-38]. In addition to generating
summary PCS and MCS scores, the SF-12 can also be
used to generate health state utilities using the SF-6D
algorithm. The SF-6D is a preference-based single index
measure for health using general population values [39].
The 18,000 health states that the SF-6D is able to de￾scribe are correlated with preference weights obtained
from a sample of the UK general population using the
recognized standard gamble valuation technique. The
SF-6D index has interval scoring properties and yields
summary scores on a theoretical 0–1 scale, where 0 is a
state equivalent to death, and 1 is equivalent to perfect
health. A .03 point difference is typically considered the
minimally clinically important difference [40].
Statistical analysis
Mean and standard deviation were calculated for all con￾tinuous measures, and frequencies and percentages were
computed for categorical variables. Comparisons be￾tween HCV infected patients and controls (unmatched
and matched) were made using chi-square tests for cat￾egorical outcomes and independent-samples t-tests for
continuous outcomes. Because distributions of work im￾pairment, activity impairment, and healthcare resource
utilization were positively skewed, the Mann–Whitney
U test was used in lieu of the t-test. An error rate of 5%
was adopted for all hypothesis tests, which were con￾ducted in SPSS version 19.0.
Results
Of the 57,805 respondents in the 2010 European
NHWS, 633 reported HBV, HIV, or AIDS, and were
excluded from the sample. An additional 6 individuals
Vietri et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2013, 13:16 Page 3 of 8

were excluded because they reported HCV infection but
indicated they had not been diagnosed by a physician.
This resulted in a total sample size of 57,166, of which
286 reported a physician diagnosis of HCV. Of those
reporting a diagnosis, 36 (12.6%) reported currently re￾ceiving prescription treatment for HCV, an additional
111 (38.8%) reported receiving prescription treatment in
the past, and 250 (48.6%) reported never receiving pre￾scription treatment. The 56,880 respondents who did
not report ever experiencing HCV served as an un￾matched control group.
As displayed in Table 1, HCV infected patients differed in
a variety of ways from the non-HCV respondents in the
European NHWS. Those with HCV infection were less
likely to come from the UK or Germany, and more likely to
come from Italy and Spain, consistent with the differences
in HCV prevalence in those countries (all p < .05). HCV
infected patients were older (53 vs. 46, p < .001), more likely
to be male (58% vs. 48%, p < .001), or smoke cigarettes
(46% vs. 28%, p < .001), and were less likely to decline to re￾port their sexual orientation (2% vs. 4%, p < .001) or drink
alcohol (68% vs. 79%, p < .001), although over two-thirds of
the HCV infected patients reported doing so. HCV infected
patients also had more co-morbid conditions, excluding
liver disease (.69 vs. .27, p < .01).
HCV patients generally reported worse outcomes than
unmatched controls, presented in Table 2. HCV infected
patients reported more impairment on all measures of
work and activity impairment than unmatched control
patients (all p < .001). Likewise, HCV patients also used
more healthcare resources across all categories (all p < .01).
The higher work productivity impairments and healthcare
resource use observed among HCV patients resulted in
higher estimated costs (all p < .01), presented in Table 3.
HCV patients also had significantly worse HRQoL than
non-HCV patients on all measures (all p < .001).
There were no significant differences on demographics
between HCV infected patients and propensity matched
controls (data not presented), though many of the decre￾ments in outcomes associated with HCV remained sig￾nificant (Table 2). Among HCV infected patients who
reported being employed, health problems resulted in
missing 43% more work than controls (7.8% vs. 5.5%,
p < .05), and 80% greater impairment while at work
(26.3% vs. 14.5%, p < .001), leading to 66% greater overall
work impairment (30.5% vs. 18.3%, p < .001). Likewise,
HCV was associated with greater impairment in non￾work activities (34.4% vs. 28.5%, p < .05).
HCV patients also had more physician visits per year
than matched controls (19.8 vs.13.3, p < .001). However,
lack of power prevented the detection of differences be￾tween HCV patients and controls for annual ER visits
(.68 vs. .39, p = .33) and hospitalizations (.52 vs. .27,
p = .07), though these differences were of a similar
magnitude as the significant differences between HCV
patients and the unmatched non-HCV sample.
Costs were also estimated to be higher among HCV
patients (Table 3). Employed HCV patients lost an aver￾age of €1,914 worth of productivity to absenteeism per
year, 60% more than their matched controls (€1,195,
p < .05). Impairment while at work (presenteeism) is also
significantly more costly in HCV patients than controls,
with annual productivity losses averaging €5,268 and
€3,154 (p < .05), respectively, for an overall indirect cost

of €7,182 per year, €2,810 more per employed patient
per year than controls (p < .01 for the difference). Direct
costs were also significantly elevated among HCV
patients, with annual costs 76% greater than matched
controls (€1,147 vs. €652, p < .001), driven by signifi￾cantly greater costs due to physician visits (€487 vs.
€330, p < .001) and hospitalization, though lack of power
prevented the difference in hospitalization costs from
reaching statistical significance (€589 vs. €280, p < .08).
HCV infection also impacted the three measures of
HRQoL. HCV patients had a clinically meaningful .04
decrement in health utilities compared to matched con￾trols (.67 vs. .71, p < .01). MCS scores in HCV were
about 2 points lower than matched controls (44.17 vs.
46.36, p < .05), while PCS scores were about 2.5 points
lower in HCV (43.61 vs. 46.36, p < .01), though these dif￾ferences are slightly smaller than would be considered
clinically meaningful.
Treatment-naïve patients
Worse outcomes were also seen among the treatment￾naïve subgroup (n = 139) relative to matched controls.

Employed treatment-naïve patients reported significantly
greater work impairment than matched controls. As dis￾played in Table 4, untreated HCV infection was asso￾ciated with nearly twice the impairment while at work
(presenteeism; 24.8% vs. 12.9%, p < .01). Overall work
impairment was elevated to a similar degree (28.7% vs.
14.8%, p < .01). However, the difference in absenteeism
did not reach statistical significance (6.7% vs. 2.4%,
p = .16). Impairment in non-work activities was also
similar across HCV status (31.7% vs. 29.3%, p = .38).
Consistent with the trend observed in the larger HCV
sample, treatment-naïve patients also used more healthcare
resources than matched controls. HCV patients used all
forms of healthcare at least as much as matched controls.
Significantly, patients had about 60% more physician visits
than controls (19.5 vs. 12.1, p < .01). Differences in ER visits
(.45 vs. .35, p = .97) and hospitalizations (.36 vs. .19, p = .12)
were not statistically significant.
The greater work impairment among employed
treatment-naïve HCV patients is associated with signifi￾cantly higher economic costs due to lost productivity.
Table 5 shows the estimated value of the lost productiv￾ity. The incremental cost of HCV infection is €2,773 per
employed patient per year, primarily because of greater
presenteeism than matched controls. Likewise, more fre￾quent healthcare use is reflected in higher estimated dir￾ect medical costs, which were greater to a significant
degree for physician visits and total direct costs, incur￾ring €427 more per year on average than matched
controls. Overall, each treatment-naïve HCV patient was
associated with an average overall incremental cost of
€1,715 above the matched controls per year.
Treatment-naïve patients also reported worse mean
physical quality of life than matched controls (43.49 vs.
45.99, p < .05), though the magnitude of this effect is
slightly below the level considered clinically meaningful.
There was also a trend for patients to have lower health
utilities (.68 vs. 71, p = .08), which would be considered
clinically meaningful. The decrement on MCS scores
associated with untreated HCV did not reach statistical
significance (44.72 vs. 45.93, p = .36).
Discussion
The present study included data from a large survey of
European adults with and without HCV infection across
five counties, which measured outcomes through widely
used validated scales. Patients reporting a physician diag￾nosis of HCV infection had significantly impaired work
productivity, greater impairment in non-work activities,
more healthcare resource utilization, and worse HRQoL
than both the general population without HCV and
propensity-matched individuals without HCV infection.
The economic costs of HCV infection are considerable.
We estimated work-productivity impairment due to
HCV costs over €7,500 per employed patient per year,
an incremental indirect cost of almost €3,000 over
matched controls. Direct costs are also elevated by
almost €500 per patient when compared to matched
controls. The intangible cost of lower HRQoL observed

in this sample was also significant, particularly regarding
physical quality of life and health utility. HCV patients
had consistently worse outcomes than matched controls
across almost all outcome measures, though some mea￾sures of healthcare resource use did not reach signifi￾cance. This seems to be primarily an issue of statistical
power, as those that did not reach significance—ER visits
and hospitalizations—were those measuring rare events
experienced by a minority of respondents. A previous
study using the same measures but using a larger, US
sample found significant results, despite observing nu￾merically smaller differences between HCV patients and
controls [24]. Otherwise, the HRQoL decrements and
work impairment observed in the present analysis are
consistent with those measured in the US NHWS, and
of a similar magnitude [18].
In addition to examining HCV infected patients as a
whole, the present study also considered treatment-naïve
patients separately. The treatment-naïve patients are an
especially interesting subgroup, as they are neither bur￾dened by the adverse events of treatment, nor benefited
from a successful therapy, and so may better represent
the burden of untreated HCV infection. Relative to
matched controls, these patients reported greater im￾pairment at work and more frequent physician visits,
and estimated costs were also higher. Unlike treatment￾experienced patients, these individuals’ elevated resource
use would not be due to treatment or adverse events
associated with such treatment, nor would work impair￾ments or reduced HRQoL be due to side effects. The
pattern of results in this subgroup was generally consist￾ent with the findings in the broader comparisons, with
few exceptions. Treatment-naïve patients did not show
significantly elevated absenteeism relative to matched
controls, but the magnitude of the difference was actu￾ally larger than in the broader comparison, suggesting
that this difference is simply due to a lack of power ra￾ther than a different pattern among treatment-naïve
patients.
The use of propensity scoring matching ensures that
none of the effects observed could be attributed to any
demographic or health history variables included in the
matching analyses. However, we cannot rule out the pos￾sibility that additional variables (such as prior drug use)
not included in the matching may explain the observed
differences in health outcomes. However, most of the
likely factors (co-morbid health conditions, health beha￾viors, etc.) were equated by the matching procedure.
The self-report survey methodology did not allow us
to verify HCV diagnosis. However, the findings coincide
with those of previous studies, suggesting this HCV sam￾ple is similar to that of other, clinically-verified HCV
samples. We were also unable to confirm that controls
were free of HCV infection, and given that many HCV
patients are unaware of the infection it is possible that
HCV patients were in the control group, causing us to
underestimate the impact of HCV infection. The current
study did not assess reasons for healthcare resource
utilization but, given the propensity score methodology,
the assumption was made that the additional resources
used by the HCV group were due to the virus itself, as
none of the assessed demographic or non-HCV health
history variables differed between the groups. Some se￾lection bias may also be present, in that individuals who
completed the survey may have differed in some mean￾ingful way from those who did not respond. However,
for such a bias to affect the conclusions, the effect of
HCV would have to be different among those who chose
not to complete the survey than in those who did re￾spond, which seems unlikely. Finally, the modest num￾ber of HCV infected respondents limits the precision of
the estimates of the associated burden, though this
would not contribute to spurious positive findings.
Conclusions
The humanistic and economic burden of HCV in Europe
is substantial. The pattern of results is similar among
treatment-naïve patients, which suggests that the burden of
treatment is not driving the elevated resource use and lower
HRQoL observed in the broader sample. Effective treat￾ment of HCV may alleviate the work impairment asso￾ciated with HCV and lower use of healthcare resources,
while providing improved quality of life to the individual.
