The role of rodents in the epidemiology of zoonotic 
hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been a subject of 
considerable debate. Seroprevalence studies suggest 
widespread HEV infection in commensal Rattus spp. 
rats, but experimental transmission has been largely 
unsuccessful and recovery of zoonotic genotype 3 HEV 
RNA from wild Rattus spp. rats has never been confi rmed. 
We surveyed R. rattus and R. norvegicus rats from across 
the United States and several international populations by 
using a hemi-nested reverse transcription PCR approach. 
We isolated HEV RNA in liver tissues from 35 of 446 rats 
examined. All but 1 of these isolates was relegated to the 
zoonotic HEV genotype 3, and the remaining sequence 
represented the recently discovered rat genotype from 
the United States and Germany. HEV-positive rats were 
detected in urban and remote localities. Genetic analyses 
suggest all HEV genotype 3 isolates obtained from wild 
Rattus spp. rats were closely related.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute 
hepatitis in developing countries, in which outbreaks 
arise most often through fecal contamination of drinking 
water or after fl ooding (1). Major outbreaks have been 
reported in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Mexico, 
and mortality rates are considerable (20%–30%) among 
pregnant women (1). In industrialized countries, HEV 
infections are reported sporadically and contamination of 
drinking water is an unlikely source, but cases are increasing 
as diagnostic tests are being performed more frequently 
(2). Moreover, zoonotic transmission of HEV through 
consumption of undercooked pork and deer meat has been 
confi rmed (3,4), and detection of HEV in many mammalian 
hosts suggests the potential for multiple zoonotic sources 
of HEV infection in industrialized countries (5).
There are currently at least 4 genotypes of HEV known 
to infect humans. Genotypes 1 and 2 have been identifi ed 
only from humans and are responsible for most outbreaks 
in developing countries (6). Genotypes 3 and 4 are believed 
to be involved in zoonotic transmission and have been 
isolated from swine (domesticated pig and wild boar), 
deer, mongoose, rabbits, cattle, and humans (5). Additional 
strains not known to infect humans have also been identifi ed 
in rats and chickens, and the genetic diversity of HEV is 
only beginning to be understood.
Within the United States, HEV infections have been 
identifi ed in travelers who have visited developing countries 
(7), and for several at-risk groups in the United States 
(i.e., swine veterinarians and farmers), the high number of 
reported seropositive persons is caused by swine–human 
contact (8,9). However, seroepidemiologic examinations 
of blood banks in the United States and other industrialized 
countries have shown high proportions of samples positive 
for antibodies against HEV (excluding persons who had 
traveled to HEV-endemic countries), but this fi nding was 
true in urban areas in which swine–human contact is absent 
(8,10,11).
HEV RNA has been detected in livers from 
commercially raised pigs (12) and represents an additional 
potential reservoir of infection. However, consumption of 
raw pork and wild game is uncommon in the United States, 
although it is a common practice in other industrialized 
nations in which high HEV seroprevalence has been 
reported (i.e., France) (13). This fi nding suggests that in 
addition to travel to HEV-endemic regions and swine–
human contact, additional reservoirs of HEV infection 
exist in the United States, and evidence has accumulated 
indicating rodents as a potential HEV reservoir (14–18). In

HEV Genotype 3 in Wild Rats, United States
 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 18, No. 8, August 2012 1269
a survey of 26 rodent species in the United States, Favorov 
et al. (14) found 14 species of rodents seropositive for 
antibodies against HEV. Urban populations had ≈2× the 
proportion of seropositive rats relative to rural populations, 
and commensal Rattus spp. (R. rattus and R. norvegicus) 
rats had the highest proportion of seropositive animals (14).
The role of wild Rattus spp. rats as reservoirs in the 
epidemiology and transmission of HEV is unclear, but their 
ubiquity in urban environments and unparalleled propensity 
for carrying zoonotic pathogens makes them an obvious 
target of investigation. Multiple studies have reported 
fi nding IgG and IgM against HEV in R. norvegicus and R. 
rattus rat populations across the United States and Asia (14–
18). Shukla et al. (19) successfully infected cell lines from 
Mus musculus mice, murid rodents closely related to Rattus
spp. rats, with HEV genotype 3. In addition, Maneerat et 
al. (20) experimentally infected laboratory R. norvegicus
rats with HEV isolated from infected humans, although the 
genotype of the infecting virus was unclear. After infection, 
the human virus strain effectively replicated in multiple 
tissues, and HEV RNA was detected in feces and serum for 
>30 days postexposure, suggesting that human strains of 
HEV can replicate in and be transmitted by R. norvegicus
rats. However, recent discovery of a rat-specifi c strain of 
HEV not known to infect humans (21–23) suggests that 
high seroprevalence of antibodies against HEV may be 
caused by cross-reactivity rather than widespread infection 
with a human-infecting HEV genotype.
We used a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) 
approach to survey R. rattus and R. norvegicus rats for HEV 
RNA. Our analysis detected HEV RNA in liver tissues from 
R. rattus and R. norvegicus rats at many localities across the 
United States. Sequencing of DNA from RT-PCR–positive 
samples indicated widespread infection with zoonotic HEV 
genotype 3: one rat in California was positive for the rat￾specifi c strain. These fi ndings suggest that wild Rattus spp. 
rats are competent hosts for genotype 3 HEV.

Rat Tissues
We obtained liver tissue samples from 446 R. 
rattus and R. norvegicus rats from museum collections 
(online Technical Appendix, wwwcdc.gov/eid-static/
spreadsheets/12-0070-Techapp.xls) covering localities 
primarily in the United States (15 states) plus additional 
samples from China, Honduras, Madagascar, Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Peru, Russia, and Vietnam (Table). To 
maximize the likelihood of intact viral RNA, all liver 
samples selected were dissected from recently euthanized 
animals, immediately frozen, and maintained at −80°C 
until thawed for extraction.

RESEARCH
Hemi-nested RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from ≈30 mg of liver tissue 
by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, 
USA). We used a modifi cation of the broad-spectrum RT￾PCR approach of Johne et al. (22) to amplify a 334-bp 
fragment of HEV open reading frame 1 (ORF1). Primers 
were selected for their ability to amplify ORF1 from all 
known HEV genotypes, and all primer sequences are 
reported by Johne et al. (22). Attempts to amplify the 
ORF1 fragment from total extracted RNA resulted in 
amplifi cation of a portion of an unidentifi ed transcript in all 
R. rattus rat samples. When we sequenced the amplicon, 
it was clear that spurious amplifi cation was caused by 
nonspecifi c binding of primer HEV-cas. To circumvent this 
problem, we used a hemi-nested approach, with the initial 
RT-PCR using the HEV-cs/HEV-casN primer combination 
and the nested PCR using the HEV-csN/HEV-casN primer 
combination. With the exception of the change in primer 
combinations, all other aspects of amplifi cation followed 
the protocol of Johne et al. (22). Positive PCR amplicons 
(verifi ed by agarose gel electrophoresis) were purifi ed by 
using the Wizard SV Gel PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, 
Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced in both directions by 
using nested PCR primers (HEVcsN/HEVcasN).
Given the high sensitivity of a nested PCR approach, 
contamination can be a major issue and has been cited 
as problematic in investigations of HEV in rodents 
(24). Exceptional effort was made to ensure that no 
contamination occurred. All PCR steps were conducted in 
a sterile environment, under a laminar fl ow hood, and all 
surfaces, tubes, and equipment were UV irradiated between 
each PCR. This study was conducted in a newly constructed 
laboratory in which no HEV samples (or any other animal 
samples) had been handled, extractions were conducted in 
a room separate from that used for PCR amplifi cations, and 
all steps (extraction, RT-PCR, and nested PCR) included 
negative controls. In addition, a single HEV genotype 
3 isolate was used as a positive control in PCRs, and we 
sequenced this isolate for the same locus targeted for the 
Rattus spp. rat samples. Any Rattus spp. rat HEV isolate 
exhibiting 100% nt identity to this positive control sequence 
was excluded as a contaminant.
Phylogenetic Analyses
In addition to the sequences we generated, we 
downloaded all complete HEV genome sequences from 
GenBank (accession numbers are shown in the online 
Appendix Figure, wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/18/8/12-
0070-FA1.htm) and extracted the ≈334-bp homologous 
portion of ORF1 from each genome. Total sequences were 
aligned by using the MAFFT aligner (25) implemented 
in Geneious version 5.5 (26). We conducted Bayesian, 
maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likelihood phylo￾genetic analyses on the combined alignment by using the 
avian HEV strain as an outgroup. For Bayesian analysis 
conducted in MrBayes version 3.2 (27), we partitioned the 
alignment by codon position and used a generalized time 
reversible + invariant sites + Γ substitution model, which 
Modeltest version 3.7 (28) indicated to be most appropriate. 
The analysis was run for 15,000,000 generations sampled 
every 1,000 generations, and burn-in values were 
determined empirically by evaluating likelihood scores. 
For maximum-parsimony analysis, we used tree bisection/
reconnection branch swapping, 25 random additions of input 
taxa, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates to assess node support. 
For maximum-likelihood analysis, we used a generalized 
time reversible + invariant sites + Γ substitution model 
as indicated above, nearest-neighbor interchange branch￾swapping, and 500 bootstrap replicates to assess node 
support. We generated a haplotype network for sequences 
generated in this study by using TCS software (29).
Results
We excluded 7 isolates sequenced from 1 PCR batch 
that matched the positive control sequence. No subsequent 
matches with the positive control were detected, and no 
contamination was detected in negative controls. We 
identifi ed 35 (7.85%) Rattus spp. rats positive for HEV 
by PCR from 446 rats examined. Most positive samples 
were from California (15 rats), but some were from rats in 
Tennessee, Florida, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and 
Alaska (Table). Phylogenetic analysis placed 34 of these 
positive rat samples in a closely related group within the

HEV genotype 3 clade (online Appendix Figure) termed 
subclade 3a by Lu et al. (6). This placement was supported 
in all analyses. Mean pairwise uncorrected genetic distances 
between HEV genotype 3 sequences and other known 
HEV genotypes were 36.19%, 24.12%, 24.91%, 24.05%, 
and 33.52% compared with the avian genotype, genotype 
2, genotype 1, genotype 4, and rat genotype, respectively. 
Network analysis showed that HEV genotype 3 sequences 
from Rattus spp. rats formed a tight cluster (Figure), 
differed by only a few mutations, and represented a single 
strain. Mean pairwise sequence divergence within Rattus
spp. rat HEV genotype 3 sequences was 0.51%. A single 
sequence (AF082843) isolated from an HEV-infected pig 
was also in this group.
The single sequence not nested within the genotype-3 
clade was isolated from an R. norvegicus rat from the San 
Francisco Bay area of California. Phylogenetic analyses 
placed it in a strongly supported clade with 2 other 
sequences isolated from R. norvegicus rats in Germany 
(online Appendix Figure). Uncorrected genetic distances 
indicated that the California rat HEV sequence is ≈2× 
as divergent from the 2 sequences isolated in Germany 
(California vs. GU345042 = 13.98%; California vs. 
GU345043 = 14.86%) as the 2 Germany sequences are 
from each other (GU345042 vs. GU345043 = 7.78%). 
These fi ndings suggest a degree of distinction between rat 
HEV strains from the United States and Europe.
Discussion
A major confl ict has surrounded the role of Rattus
spp. rats (and other rodents) in HEV epidemiology since 
seroprevalence studies in the 1990s identifi ed multiple 
species of rats positive for HEV antibodies in the United 
States and Asia (15–18). Maneerat et al. (20) infected 3 
Wistar laboratory rats (R. norvegicus) with HEV (viral 
RNA was detected intermittently in feces for <30 days), 
but which genotype was used is unclear, and this result has 
not been duplicated (9). In addition, He et al. (24) isolated 
HEV genotype 1 from R. rattus and Bandicota bengalensis
rats, but the study was later retracted because the authors 
were unable to rule out contamination as a source of 
detected viral RNA (30). More recently, Shukla et al. (19) 
successfully infected multiple M. musculus mouse cell 
cultures (in addition to infecting cow, rabbit, cat, dog, and 
chicken cultures) with HEV genotype 3, supporting the 
hypothesis that rodents may be competent hosts. However, 
there was substantial variation among different strains of 
HEV genotype 3 in the ability to infect cells derived from 
different hosts, including swine and human.
A recent attempt to infect adult Sprague-Dawley 
laboratory rats (R. norvegicus) with HEV genotypes 1, 2, 
and 3 failed (23). In this same study, infection of laboratory 
rats with the divergent rat genotype had limited success; 
only 25% of intravenously infected Sprague-Dawley rats 
and only 15.8% of nude rats seroconverted. This result is 
unexpected given that ≈80% of wild R. norvegicus rats from 
Los Angeles, California, where the study was conducted, 
were positive for IgG or IgM against HEV, suggesting 
that infection occurs in the wild (23). Johne et al. (22) 
also were unsuccessful in infecting rat liver cell lines with 
rat genotype HEV isolated from wild R. norvegicus rats 
from Germany. In contrast, we provide evidence of HEV 
genotype 3 infection in wild R. rattus and R. norvegicus
rats.
Spread of HEV-positive rats indicates that infection 
in wild Rattus spp. rats is not restricted to any area of 
the United States or to urban areas. Our positive samples 
included both Rattus species of rat tested, and included the 
relatively remote Aleutian Islands in Alaska, and the urban 
San Francisco Bay area in California. Given the commensal 
nature of wild Rattus spp. rats and their ability to use 
human transportation vectors (i.e., commercial shipping) in 
dispersal, the prevalence of HEV in remote populations is 
not surprising. Recent work examining the genetic structure 
of R. rattus rats has shown that 2 mtDNA haplotypes have 
rapidly spread from their origin in India to every continent 
except Antarctica (31,32). Given the presence of HEV in 
domesticated animals (i.e., pigs) and human commensals 
(i.e., wild Rattus spp. rats), widespread domestication 
has likely enabled HEV to spread worldwide, potentially 
through interactions between humans, domesticated 
animals, and commensal rats. Furthermore, because R. 
rattus and R. norvegicus rats are sympatric over their 
contemporary range, lack of genetic distinction between 
strains infecting these 2 species is not unexpected (online 
Appendix Figure, Figure).
In terms of infection rates, variation in handling of 
tissues from fi eld-collected animals should be considered. 
Although we attempted to limit our analysis to the most 
well-preserved tissues, there is considerable variation 
among collection protocols and collectors in length of 
time between euthanasia and dissection, time between 
dissection and freezing, number of times tissues were 
thawed and frozen (i.e., in sorting, subsampling, shipping), 
and consistency of storage temperature. These factors can 
lead to nucleic acid degradation and negatively affect the 
ability to detect viral RNA. Therefore, our infection rate is 
likely not indicative of HEV infection rates in wild Rattus
spp. rat populations.
Recent studies have reported major variation in 
diversity of competent mammalian hosts for various strains 
of HEV genotype 3 (19). Although seroprevalence studies 
have suggested infection rates ≈80% for HEV in US Rattus
spp. rat populations (15,23), attempts to infect different 
laboratory strains of R. norvegicus rats with a genotype 
isolated from wild R. norvegicus rats have shown limited 

RESEARCH
success; most attempts also failed in immunocompromised 
nude rats (22,23). These patterns, and the low genetic 
diversity of HEV-positive samples detected in this study 
(Figure), suggest that only a limited number of HEV 
genotype 3 strains may be capable of infecting Rattus spp. 
rats and other rodents (i.e., Mus spp.), possibly because of 
an HEV genotype 3/rat genotype recombinant.
Reduced genetic diversity of ORF1 sequences 
obtained from Rattus spp. rats requires further study, 
including sequencing genomes of these isolates to identify 
sequence diversity at other loci. Diffi culty in transmitting 
virus from infected wild R. norvegicus rats into laboratory 
strains also indicates that certain life history or genetic 
characteristics may be essential for infection. Purcell et 
al. (23) reported a positive correlation between antibody 
prevalence and animal age in their study of seroprevalence 
of HEV in Rattus spp. rats, suggested that rats are readily 
infected in the wild, and that infection occurred in juvenile 
rats. This pattern is consistent with HEV infection in 
humans and swine (33,34), and suggests that infections 
should be attempted in wild and laboratory juvenile rats. 
Lending further support to this suggestion, the only report 
of major long-term infection (>30 days) of rats with HEV 
used weanling rats (20), and all other attempts we are aware 
of have used only adult rats (23). In addition, extreme 
variation in host specifi city that Shukla et al. (19) observed 
among different HEV genotype 3 strains indicates the need 
for future transmission studies to include as many strains 
as possible.
