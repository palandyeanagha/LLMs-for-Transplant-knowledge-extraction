Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are used illicitly at high
doses by bodybuilders. The misuse of these drugs is
associated with serious adverse effects to the liver, including
cellular adenomas and adenocarcinomas. We report two
very different cases of adult male bodybuilders who
developed hepatocellular adenomas following AAS abuse.
The first patient was asymptomatic but had two large liver
lesions which were detected by ultrasound studies after
routine medical examination. The second patient was
admitted to our hospital with acute renal failure and
ultrasound (US) studies showed mild hepatomegaly with
several very close hyperecogenic nodules in liver, concordant
with adenomas at first diagnosis. In both cases the patients
have evolved favourably and the tumours have shown a
tendency to regress after the withdrawal of AAS. The cases
presented here are rare but may well be suggestive of the
natural course of AAS induced hepatocellular adenomas. In
conclusion, sportsmen taking AAS should be considered as a
group at risk of developing hepatic sex hormone related
tumours. Consequently, they should be carefully and
periodically monitored with US studies. In any case, despite
the size of the tumours detected in these two cases, the
possibility of spontaneous tumour regression must also be
taken in account.
Agrowing number of reports of anabolic androgenic
steroid (AAS) misuse in Western Europe and the USA
by non-competitive athletes, especially bodybuilders,
has emerged, especially since the beginning of the 1990s.1 In
fact, a wide range of anabolic steroids are being self
administered.1 2 AAS are used at high doses by bodybuilders
to achieve a rapid increase in muscle mass. Although the use
of anabolic steroids is associated with a number of side
effects,3 the prevalence of toxic effects following AAS
administration is difficult to ascertain because of under￾reporting. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that
the abuse of AAS is associated with serious adverse effects
affecting the liver and the cardiovascular, central nervous,
musculoskeletal, endocrine, and reproductive systems.
Several liver disorders have been reported to be associated
with AAS consumption, namely cholestasis, peliosis hepatis,
and liver tumours.1–3 Although most of these tumours are
benign, early detection is important in order to avoid the
associated risks of life threatening haemorrhages and
malignant degeneration.4 These hepatic alterations are
caused almost exclusively by 17a-alkylated AAS.1–3
CASE REPORT 1
In this first study we report a 35 year old male bodybuilder
who has been taking AAS at high doses over the last 15 years.
During this period a number of AAS were self administered
in cycles of 8 weeks with a suspension period of 2 weeks
between cycles. The following AAS were the most frequently
consumed by the patient: (a) oral: stanozolol and oxymetho￾lone; and (b) parenteral: nandrolone decanoate, testosterone
enanthate, and methenolone enanthate.
The doses and the frequency of self administration were,
approximately, 400 mg daily for oral AAS and 600 mg twice
or three times a week for parenteral AAS, varying in each
cycle.
The patient was completely asymptomatic, with no signs of
jaundice, when he was included in an experimental follow up
examination programme for bodybuilders. In general terms,
there was no relevant previous history. Neither daily intake of
ethanol or smoking were reported. In the clinical examina￾tion performed shortly after admission to the program, our
patient showed severe hepatomegaly. Laboratory evaluation
revealed slight damage of liver function (ALT: 75 IU/l; AST:
53 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase: 403 IU/l; GGT: 60 IU/l; total
bilirubin: 1.6 mg/ml; direct bilirubin: 0.42 mg/dl) and
muscular damage (CPK: 298 IU/l). Coagulation tests were
entirely normal, as were serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein
(AFP). Hepatitis virus markers, including hepatitis B and C,
were negative. Serum levels of sex hypophyseal hormones
(FSH and LH) were evaluated but were not detectable.
Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed two large hypereco￾genic lesions in the liver, one in the left lobe (6 cm in size)
and another in the right (12 cm in size). The largest lesion
showed a heterogeneous pattern, thus indicating the exis￾tence of haemorrhage areas in the tumour. In colour power
Doppler ultrasonography blood flow signals could only be
detected at the peripheral areas of both tumours. These
results are concordant with adenomas at first diagnosis
(fig 1).
Cytology was performed by fine needle puncture-aspiration
(FPA) of the nodules. The cytological samples did not reveal
any malignancy. Subsequently, the patient was subjected to
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI study con￾firmed the diagnosis of liver cell adenomas (fig 2A and B). T1
weighted MRI showed a heterogeneous signal in both
tumours, although this heterogeneity was more intense in
the lesion of the right lobe. In T2 weighted MRI, the lesions
showed an intense mixed pattern, more pronounced in the
largest tumour, thus indicating the presence of necrotic and/
or haemorrhagic areas in the lesion. The absence of any other
risk factor and the previous history of AAS consumption at
high doses allowed us to establish the aetiology of the liver
tumours: hepatic adenomas secondary to AAS abuse. Given

the considerable size of the lesions, it was not possible to
establish any therapeutic guidelines, with the exception of
absolute prohibition on self administering AAS and the
inclusion of this patient in a liver transplantation program.
The patient has been followed biannually by means of US
and analytical studies.
The patient was subjected to clinical, radiological, and
analytical tests 1 year after diagnosis. Biochemical values
showed a persistent slight alteration in liver function. AFP
serum levels stayed normal, while US studies demonstrated
that the lesions had remained unaltered and of the same size
as the year before the persistent slight alteration. To confirm
the absence of any malignancy, a biopsy under ecographic
control was performed. The histological findings showed
neither portal tract in the tumour nor capsule formation
around it. The nuclei of the tumour cells showed mild atypia
and a low degree of anisonucleosis. These histopathological
results confirmed again that the lesions were non-malignant
tumours.
At present, 4 years after the diagnosis and subsequent to
further ecographic examinations, to our surprise, there has
been a slight decrease in the size of the tumours (of about 1–
2 cm in the tumour in the left lobe and 3–4 cm in the tumour
in the right lobe) (not shown). Liver function has also clearly
improved. Serum levels of transaminases have returned to
normal, as have the other serum markers of liver function. As
in previous examinations, coagulation tests and serum levels
of AFP were absolutely normal. On the other hand, the serum
levels of sex hypophyseal hormones (FSH and LH) were
evaluated and found to be normal, thus suggesting that the
withdrawal of AAS may have induced the total recovery of
the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis. However, the patient
continues in the above mentioned liver transplantation
program and undergoes periodic examination because of
the enormous size and the potential malignant transforma￾tion of the liver lesions.
CASE REPORT 2
We report another patient, a 23 year old male bodybuilder,
with diverse severe symptoms and signs affecting different
organs and systems due to misuse of various AAS at high
doses. The patient had commenced treatment with AAS (and
diuretics) 6 months before the appearance of the symptoms
and had undertaken stringent diets for increasing muscle
mass prior to competition. AAS were administered in cycles
of 8 weeks, twice or three times a week, varying in each cycle,
with a suspension period of 2 weeks between cycles. Each
week the bodybuilder self administered the following AAS:
(a) oral: stanozolol and oxymetholone; and (b) parenteral:
nandrolone decanoate, testosterone phenylpropionate, and
boldenone.
His nutrition also went through cycles. During the first
3 months he followed a hypercaloric and hyperproteinic diet
to build up muscle mass. There then followed a phase of
reduced caloric intake to lessen subcutaneous fat. He also
severely restricted Na+ and water intake and self adminis￾tered a diuretic, torasemide, to attain better muscle contour
definition by reducing extracellular and subcutaneous tissue
volume.
The patient began to show symptoms after 6 months of
treatment with AAS and 1 month of treatment with diuretics
and a restrictive diet. He then stopped training and drug self
administration and was admitted to the emergency service of
our hospital in a confused state. The patient displayed
asthenia and anorexia of 1 month duration. Analytical data
reflected acute renal failure (urea: 304 mg/100 ml; creatinin:
10.2 mg/100 ml), muscular damage (myoglobinuria; CPK:
5499 IU/l; ALT: 178 IU/l; AST: 130 IU/l; LDH: 716 IU/l),
metabolic alkalosis (pH: 7.62; Pco2: 66.1 mm Hg; Po2:
80.6 mm Hg; HCO32: 77.8 mmol/l), hypokaliaemia (K+
:
2.12 mEq/l), and hypernatraemia (Na+
: 147 mEq/l). Neither
a daily ethanol intake or smoking were reported. It is well
established that AAS induce fluid retention with hyperna￾traemia. Excess Na+ in the blood produces an increasing rate
of K+ and H+ excretion, inducing metabolic alkalosis and
hypokaliaemia and, consistently, a decrease in the respiratory
frequency with compensatory respiratory acidosis. The
marked hypokaliaemia suffered by the patient could be
explained by the fact that this bodybuilder did not maintain
an adequate Na+
, K+ and water intake over the training
periods, and, furthermore, self administered a loop diuretic.
This marked hypokaliaemia favoured muscle damage and
rhabdomyolisis. Furthermore, the high doses of self adminis￾tered AAS presumably promoted aggression and other
changes in attitude that could explain the excess training

despite muscle weakness due to hypokaliaemia. This situa￾tion resulted in multiple ruptures of muscle fibres (increasing
serum values of CPK, AST, ALT, LDH, and elevation of blood
levels of myoglobin and myoglobinuria). The increase in
myoglobin renal excretion, with subsequent cylinder forma￾tion in the nephron or/and direct toxicity to tubular cells, led
to acute renal failure.
At physical examination, abdomen, heart, lung, and
the neurological system showed normal functioning.
Bradypsychia, confusion, and asthenia were the most obvious
symptoms. The patient was admitted to the nephrology unit
for haemodialysis to treat renal failure. US performed shortly
after admission showed mild hepatomegaly, with a few very
close hyperecogenic nodules in segment IV, concordant with
adenomas (fig 3). FPA of these nodules did not reveal any
malignancy.
Coagulation tests were entirely normal, as were AFP serum
levels. Serum levels of sex hypophyseal hormones (FSH and
LH) were evaluated but were not detected. After diagnosis,
the patient underwent three haemodialysis sessions and was
encouraged to rest as much as possible, with absolute
prohibition on self administering AAS. The biochemical
values of the patient returned to normal 20 days later, except
for the hormonal serum values. Once the acute renal failure,
asthenia, and confusion had resolved, he was discharged
from hospital.
US studies performed 1 year later showed a decrease in the
size of the hyperecogenic hepatic nodules (not shown) and
biochemical analytical values were close to normal.
DISCUSSION
Hepatic adenomas (HA) are uncommon benign neoplasms,
usually occurring in young women who take oral contra￾ceptives. In recent times anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS)
have been proved to be involved in the development of HA.4 5
Although more than 750 cases of oral contraceptive induced
HA have been reported, apparently androgen induced HA are
relatively rare. However, the possibility that oral AAS such as
stanozolol can induce liver cell proliferation must be taken
into account.5–7
HA are not malignant tumours, but surgical intervention
may be required if sudden massive bleeding or liver failure
occurs; rupture of HA with haemoperitoneum can be a life
threatening complication.8–11 HA are hypervascular tumours
containing multiple sinusoids of capillaries with thin walls in
which the pressure is exclusively arterial. The connective
tissue support is poor and, therefore, bleeding tends to spread
diffusely throughout the entire tumour.10 A non-surgical
approach should be considered for androgen induced HA,
given that some tumours have regressed after AAS admin￾istration was stopped.4 7–9 12
One of the problems that HA present is differentiation
between HA and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In fact,
radiological findings in patient with HA are often similar to
those in patients with HCC.2 12–14 In those cases in which
clinical, radiological, and histological distinctions between
HA and HCC are difficult to determine, surgical resection, if
possible, may be recommended.2 4 In our patients, histo￾pathological studies of liver specimens obtained by FPA and
biopsy allowed us to establish the diagnosis of HA.
Another problem with HA is their potential for malignant
transformation, although this point is still controversial.
Rapid progression of tumours and tumour obstruction of the
intrahepatic portal veins, demonstrated by US, CT, or MRI
studies, could indicate the possibility of malignant transfor￾mation. For this reason, a careful follow up of HA patients by
means of US studies every 6 months is absolutely neces￾sary.2 8 14–16
Several reasons make it difficult to establish a general
strategy of treatment of hepatocellular adenomas: the risk of
haemorrhage, the technical difficulties encountered in
tumour excision, and the uncertain risk of malignant
transformation. These factors determine the prognosis of
the disease.8 17 In a number of cases, other therapies, such as
ethanol injection therapy or radiofrequency ablation, should
also be evaluated.8 Thus, young men with HA should undergo
tumour resection, even when there is no liver failure, rupture,
or malignant transformation. However, in the cases here
reported hepatic resection has not been performed because of
the size and number of the tumours. Furthermore, the fact
that following the last test there was an evident decrease in
the size of the lesions in both cases opens the possibility that
in future years the first patient may be operated on and his
lesions resected and in second patient the lesions may regress
spontaneously. The clinical evolution of these cases indicates
that withdrawal of AAS self administration is the main, and
possibly the only, therapeutic tool necessary in cases of
early diagnosis of the tumour. In contrast, in evolved cases,
with late diagnosis, surgical treatment will probably be
necessary.
CONCLUSIONS
Sportsmen, especially bodybuilders, taking anabolic andro￾genic steroids over a long period should be considered a
group at risk of developing hepatic sex hormone related
tumours, and should therefore be monitored annually with
US examination. Periodic US studies seem to be an adequate
screening procedure to detect the development of space
occupying lesions. Up to now, when one of these tumours
was diagnosed, or even suspected, in an asymptomatic
patient, immediate surgical excision was recommended. The
risk of intraperitoneal haemorrhage, which can be fatal,
justifies more aggressive initial management. Nevertheless, a
non-surgical approach for tumours associated with andro￾gens has been suggested because of the regression of tumours
after AAS administration was stopped. In any case, after a
diagnosis of liver tumours the administration of AAS should
cease and the patient should be carefully monitored,
preferably twice a year, with biochemical analyses of liver
function, AFP serum levels, and US studies.

What is already known on this topic
Hepatic adenomas are uncommon benign tumours usually
occurring in young people taking steroid hormones. Recently
hepatic adenomas in young people who self administered
anabolic androgenic steroids, especially 17-alfa-alkyl deri￾vatives, have been reported. Surgical resection is recom￾mended because of the risk of malignant transformation or
intratumoral bleeding and rupture. However, a non-surgical
approach for androgen induced liver tumours should be
considered.
What this study adds
The cases reported by us reinforce the importance of
withdrawing anabolic-androgenic steroids. In our experi￾ence, the first therapeutic approach to androgen induced
hepatic adenomas should be, if possible, the absolute
prohibition of taking anabolic-androgenic steroids. In some
cases, where the size of the tumours is not very large, this
therapeutic approach could be sufficient.
