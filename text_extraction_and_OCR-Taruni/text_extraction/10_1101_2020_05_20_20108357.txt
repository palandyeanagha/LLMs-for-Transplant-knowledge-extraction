Abstract 
Introduction:The outbreak of new coronavirus has become a global public health challenge. 
Given a consequential liver function, and the high risk of death coming from liver disorders, 
the assessment of Novel Coronavirus Disease on liver function is importance. Hence, we 
carried out this meta-analysis to heightening insight into the occult features of COVID 19, 
which is likely to affect liver function.
Method:This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. 
We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers, which reported available 
findings on the association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection. We used the STATA 
v.11 and random effect model for data analysis.
Result:In this present meta-analysis, 52 papers, including 8,463 COVID-19 patients, were 
studied. The prevalence of increased liver enzymes among the patients, including Alanine 
aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, were 30% and 21% in non-severe patients, 
respectively, which were 38% and 48% in severe patients. The prevalence of increasing C￾reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and Bilirubin were 55%, 39%, 28%, and 
10% in non-severe patients respectively, which were 78%, 75%, 79% and 17% in sever 
patients.The prevalence of liver toxicity as a complication of COVID-19 was 20%.Also 
patients who have severe condition are 5.54, 4.22, 4.96, 4.13 and 4.34 times more likely to 
have elevated CRP, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer enzymes retrospectively .
Conclusion:Elevation of some liver markers were higher in patients with severe COVID-19 
infection. All to gather, we assumed that abnormal liver markers could act as a prognostic 
factor for a better survey of COVID-19.

Introduction: 
The outbreak of a new virus, called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 n-COV), has been led to 
many worries amid all strata of populations, especially the vast majority of health care workers 
(1). By 11 May 2020, a considerable proportion of the population, approximately 4006257, 
was detected as Coronavirus cases, and the rate of death Toll, relatively 278892, reported. The 
rate of mortality and new cases highly progress especially, among the vast spectrum of the 
population comprised of older people (2). 2019 n-COV, in the family coronaviridae, are 
enveloped, single-stranded positive RNA viruses with different diameters from 60 to 140 nm
(3) entered into target cells by binding spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) receptor (4). Transmission of this virus is human to human through close contacts or 
droplets and also feces (5, 6). Health care workers fundamentally deal with the assortment of 
clinical characteristics that appeared among different patients. Many people are either 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The most common clinical features of symptomatic 
patients consisting of cough, fever, expectoration, myalgia or fatigue, malaise, sore throat, 
headache, diarrhea, and rarely hemoptysis and vomiting. And also, in severe cases shows a set 
of shortness of breath and dyspnea (7-12). Some infected patients would suffer from liver 
dysfunction. Based on a series of studies working on this issue, the changes in liver enzymes 
among patients, particularly in severe cases, were revealed (13-17).Given a consequential liver 
function, and the high risk of death coming from liver disorders, the assessment of Novel 
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) on liver function is of significant importance among health 
care workers (17-19). Also through a recent study on liver enzyme changes during COVID-19 
this fact that higher levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and direct Bilirubin increases 
the transfer risk to intensive and critical care units, have been stated. It is reported that the AST 
level of 30.5 (U/L) had a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 68.5% for critical and intensive 
care transfer (20). Moreover, In a similar study with us, elevated Serum levels of Aspartate 
aminotransferase, Alanin aminotransferase (ALT), total Bilirubin, and lower levels of Albumin 
were observed in severe cases (21). 
Recent studies on liver function during COVID-19 were not comprehensive, and liver function 
was not compared with the severity of the disease. This research has reviewed the 
epistemological and evidential resources on the correlation between COVID-19 and the 
function of the liver. Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to 
heightening insight into the occult features of COVID 19, which is likely to affect liver 
function.

Method: 
Search strategy
The results and their analysis in this study were reported according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We conducted a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional and case-series studies. Search engines and 
databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed without any time limitation for 
publications up to April 19, 2020. As a manual search, the list of imported references, a list of 
related reviews, and the results of Google Scholar have been investigated. The search process 
was done by two researchers using the following medical subject headings (22) keywords: 
"2019 novel coronavirus infection" OR COVID19 OR COVID-19 OR "coronavirus disease 
2019" OR "coronavirus disease-19" OR "2019-nCoV disease" OR "2019 novel coronavirus 
disease" OR "2019-nCoV infection" OR "SARS COV-2" OR SARS-COV-2, in combination 
with "Liver function" OR AST OR ALT OR "Liver toxicity" OR Bilirubin OR INR OR SGOT 
OR "Aspartate transaminase" OR "Alanine transaminase" OR SGPT OR ALP OR AFP OR 
liver OR hepat*, which were also combined with and/or/not to find more articles. As a manual 
search, the list of imported references, list of related reviews, have been investigated.
Eligibility Criteria 
We considered the following criteria for study selection: 
1) The study should have an observatory approach investigated COVID-19 patients; 
2) Studies on a particular group of people (e.g., pregnant women) has been excluded; 
3) Studies included with assessing the association between serum levels of Alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Albumin, Bilirubin, C-Reactive 
protein, ESR, D-dimer, LDH and severe outcome from COVID-19 infection as the major 
outcomes of interest and reported median (IQR) for serum levels of AST, ALT, Albumin, 
Bilirubin in both severe and non-severe COVID-19 infected patients.
4) Studies should be in English. English abstracts of other language studies were investigated 
for eligible data. 
Studies that had incomplete data for any reason and all the case reports, expert opinion articles, 
review articles, books, and animal studies were excluded. 
Study Selection
Duplicated papers were deleted using EndNote software (version X8, Thomson Reuters, 
Philadelphia, USA). Two of the authors reviewed the remaining papers according to the 
criteria, separately. Titles and abstracts were screened for initial study inclusion, with a full￾text review when the abstract was insufficient to determine if the study encountered the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria. In case of disagreement between the two investigators, a third 
person was making the final decision.

Quality assessment
For the quality assessment, two members of our team independently valued the selected articles 
using the modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment (NOS) and NIH quality 
assessment tool for case series. The investigated papers categorized into three categories. The 
studies with a score of 1 or 2 as poor quality, 3 to 6 as moderate quality and studies with a score 
of 7 to 9 as high quality. 
Data Extraction 
Data such as author's information, publication year, study design, sample size, average/median 
age and gender of patients, serum levels of CRP, LDH, D-dimer, ESR, AST, ALT, Albumin,
and Bilirubin have been extracted and recorded. 
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v.11 software. The heterogeneity of studies 
has been investigated using the I-square (I2) test. Based on the results, for I2 more than 50%, 
we used a random-effects model to pool the results. Moreover, to study the heterogeneity of 
the added study, subgroup analysis in severe and non-severe patients has been done.
Results 
Study Selection Process 
The search in three databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed yields 351 
results, and for other sources like google, scholar yields 643 results. After excluding 341 
duplicated papers, 663 records were admitted to the screening step. Then, 92 papers have been 
selected for full-text eligibility assessment. Finally, 58 studies were entered into the meta￾analysis. Also, ten studies from other sources were included in the meta-analysis. The PRISMA 
folw diagram for the study selection process presented in Figure 1.
Study Characteristics 
Among selected papers, a total of 8463 patients infected with CoVID-19 with age ranged 
between1.5 to 90 years o--ld were included in our investigation, and all of the studies were 
conducted in China. Characteristics of studies entered into meta-analysis are presented in Table 
1.
Quality Assessment 
For quality assessment, the NOS tool for cross-sectional studies and NIH quality assessment 
tools for case series were conducted.

Laboratory Findings 
Regarding laboratory findings in patients infected with COVID-19 most common observation 
was increasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) which were reported in 9, 18 and 18 studies. Meta-analysis findings are 
as follows respectively: 57% (95% Cl, 44-70), 53% (95% Cl, 43-62) and 36% (95% Cl, 25-
47). (Fig. 5, and Fig. 6).
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), D-dimer, total Bilirubin 
increasing levels in patients were reported in 20, 19, 17, and 8 studies with the prevalence of 
17% (95% Cl, 13-21), 18% (95% Cl, 14-23), 35% (95% Cl, 24-47), and 12% (95% Cl, 7-17) 
(Fig. 5 and Fig 6). Also decreasing of Albumin level were investigated in 6 studies with 
prevalence of (44%, 95% Cl, 0-88). 
Figure 2 shows the risk estimates results from the random-effect model combining the odds 
ratios (ORs) for laboratory findings between covid_19 severe and non-severe patients. CRP 
increase (OR= 5.54, 95% CI= 2.67-11.49, p=0.002), ALT increase (OR= 4.22, 95% CI= 1.01-
17.66, p=0.00), AST increase (OR= 4.96, 95% CI= 2.18-11.3, p=0.00), LDH increase (OR= 
4.13, 95% CI= 1.64-10.42, p=0.045), D-dimer increase (OR= 4.34, 95% CI= 1.7-11.09, 
p=0.00), Liver toxicity (OR= 1.67, 95% CI= 0.20-15.86, p=0.00)
Comorbidities
Different comorbidities were investigated in patients with COVID-19. Hypertension, diabetes, 
and cardiovascular disease were the most prevalent comorbidities among patients with a 
prevalence of 24% (95% Cl, 19-29), 15% (95% Cl, 11-18) and 10% (95% Cl, 8-12) that were 
investigated in 34,35 and 32 studies respectively (Fig.7, Fig.8 and Table 2). 
Other disorders prevalence was as follows: Cerebrovascular disease 3% (95% Cl, 2-4), 
digestive system disease 4% (95% Cl, 2-6), chronic liver disease 3% (95% Cl, 2-4), malignancy 
7% (95% Cl, 1-12), respiratory system disease 3% (95% Cl, 2-4), chronic kidney disease 1% ( 
95% Cl, 1-2), endocrine system disease 8% (95% Cl, 4-12), immunodeficiency 1% (95% Cl, 
0-1) and CNS disease 1% (95% Cl, 0-3) respectively (Fig.7, Fig.8, Fig.9, Fig.10 and Table 2). 
Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and shock after 
infecting with COVID-19 have been investigated in 3, 6, 6, and 6 studies, respectively. Meta￾analysis showed the prevalence of 35% (95% Cl, -28-98), 28% (95% Cl, 15-40), 8% (95% Cl, 
4-13) and 3% (95% Cl, 1-5) respectively (Fig5, Fig.10 and Table 2). Also, liver toxicity as a 
complication of COVID-19 was reported in 13 studies with the prevalence of (20%, 95% Cl, 
14-26).(Fig.5) 
Clinical outcomes of patients based on the severity 
The meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of mortality among non-severe patients was 0% 
(95% Cl, 0-1), whereas 50% (95% Cl, 39-60) in severe patients. Furthermore, the prevalence 
of discharged patients among non-severe cases were 43% (95% Cl, 1-84), which were 29% 
(95% Cl, 21-37) in severe cases (Supplementary File and Table 2).

Laboratory findings based on the severity of the disease 
In this systematic review, we analyzed the subgroups based on the severity of the disease for 
finding the source of heterogeneity. The results are as follows: 
The prevalence of increased liver enzymes among the patients, including ALT and AST were 
30% and 21% in non-severe patients, respectively, which were 38% and 48% in severe patients 
(Supplementary File and Table 2). 
The meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of increasing other laboratory findings like CRP, 
LDH, D-dimer, and Bilirubin were 55%, 39%, 28%, and 10% in non-severe patients 
respectively, which were 78%, 75%, 79% and 17% in sever patients. Also, the prevalence of 
decreasing albumin in severe patients was 36%, and the prevalence of liver toxicity among 
non-sever patients was 17%, whereas 41% in severe patients. (Supplementary File and Table 
2). 
Comorbidities based on the severity of the disease 
The prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease 
was 13%, 7%, and 4% in non-severe patients, respectively. However, these statistics were 38%, 
26%, and 16%, respectively (Supplementary File and Table 2). 
The prevalence of other underlying diseases like malignancy, digestive system disease, chronic 
liver disease, immunodeficiency, chronic kidney disease, and cerebrovascular disease were 
1%, 8%, 4%, 0%, 0% and 1% in non-severe patients respectively whereas in severe patients 
were 3%, 12%, 6%, 7%, 3% and 7% (Supplementary File and Table 2).
Discussion 
The novel coronavirus 2019, which named SARS-Cov-2, shares about 80% of the genetic 
sequence with SARS-CoV, which they also have the same cell entry receptor (23). Based on 
studies was performed by Zhao et al., it is demonstrated that 83% of ACE2-expressing cells 
were alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), suggesting that these cells can serve as a reservoir 
for viral invasion (24). Extrapulmonary sites such as the heart (25), kidney (26), endothelium 
(27), intestine (28), and liver (29) also expressed the ACE2 receptor. During recent studies, it 
is revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the cholangiocyte ACE2 receptors leading to 
cholangiocyte dysfunction and, through the induction of a systematic inflammatory response, 
causes liver injury (30). Also, Through liver biopsy assessing of the deceased case of COVID￾19, moderate microvesicular steatosis, a common finding in sepsis (31), and mild lobular and 
portal activity were observed, which confirming that this injury could occur; as a result SARS￾CoV-2 infection (32). In another theory, it is postulated that viral-induced cytotoxic T cells and 
imbalanced innate immune system lead to collateral liver damage, indicating the association 
between abnormal liver markers and COVID-19 disease severity (33, 34). 
Recent studies on SARS clinical features have revealed that the liver enzyme abnormalities 
are common but not as the prominent feature of this illness (35). Through the recent pandemic 
of SARS-CoV-2, liver dysfunction in many varieties has been reported in many cases. In this

systematic review and meta-analyses, we aimed to evaluate the prognoses of liver damage. 
Liver test abnormality at the admission time can be used as a predictor for the severity of the 
disease (36). In this case, it is assumed that enhanced end-expiratory pressure by increasing 
right atrial pressure lead to hepatic congestion and blocked venous return. So many patients 
admitted to the hospital are with liver abnormalities in the absence of mechanical ventilation 
(33). 
Acute liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more common in patients with poor prognosis 
who had significantly higher risks of developing severe pneumonia, and Male elderly COVID￾19 patients with diabetes and lymphopenia. In the early stages, it could enhance the mortality 
risk in COVID-19 patients. Also, it is reported that hepatic functional indexes of two-third 
COVID-19 patients remain poor in two weeks after discharge as the consequence of 
Compassionate drug usage during hospitalization due to lacking specific drug for SARS-CoV￾2 (37, 38). 
In the current study, trough analyses, results showed significantly higher liver toxicity in sever 
patients than non-sever patients. The liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) is a common adverse event 
that could occur during clinical practice because of the leading systemic toxicity of drugs and 
chemicals (39). Many drugs used for COVID-19 patients also could damage the liver and 
among them lopinavir/ritonavir associated with seven times higher odds of liver injury, which 
have been reported to cause liver damage and affect liver tests (36, 40). Other drugs that have 
been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, such as antibiotics, antivirals, and steroids, 
could potentially damage the liver, but still not being evident (41). However, for hospitalized 
patients, more attention should be paid to drug-induced liver damage. All to gather Liver 
enzymes elevation could be due to drugs used for treatment, sepsis, and shock (36). 
In this systematic and meta-analyses review, we observed a higher amount of ALT, AST, LDH, 
D-Dimer, CRP, and total Bilirubin (TBIL) with slightly lower albumin in sever group 
compared to non-sever groups. 
Based on previous studies on the ACE2 receptor, it is reported that slight amounts of these 
receptors were expressed in human hepatocyte (27, 42), indicating the non-significant influence 
of liver function by SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-sever and mild cases (43, 44).
Recent studies have reported the incidence of liver damage in severe cases of COVID-19 with 
mostly higher ALT, AST, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, and total bilirubin amount and lower albumin 
(36, 37, 43-45). Also, it has been mentioned that D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and AST higher 
levels were associated with COVID-19 severity (44). Moreover, through a study on deceased 
cases of COVID-19 with liver abnormalities, it is reported that in patients with severe 
complications, ALT, AST, and TBIL were higher than the standard limit. Furthermore, total 
albumin was also reported lower than the limited upper unit (46). In addition, in other studies, 
lower albumin levels in severe cases also have been reported (44, 47). Hypoalbuminemia could 
occur as a result of inadequate nutrition intake and overconsumption during hospitalization 
(43). 
Based on the result of this study, patients who have the severe condition are 5.54, 4.22, 4.96, 
4.13 and 4.34 times more likely to have elevated CRP, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer enzymes 
retrospectively. However, the chance of developing liver toxicity as a complication of COVID￾19 was 1.76 times more in severe patients. Also, in a similar study, elevated serum levels of 
AST, ALT, and total Bilirubin, and lower levels of Albumin were observed in severe cases.

Their meta-analyses for AST (95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, I2
 = 73.4%), ALT (95% CI = 4.77 to 
9.93, I2= 57.2%), TBIL (95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, I2
 = 68.8%), and Albumin (95% CI = -6.20 to 
-2.28, I2= 95.7%) (21) results were difference with us where AST(95% Cl, 14-23, I2= 94.03%), 
ALT (95% Cl, 13-21, I2= 97.47%), and TBIL (95% Cl, 7-17, I2= 66.67%), ( 95% Cl, 0-88, 
I
2=0%) in severe cases accompanied with better results except of Albumin due to higher 
included studies. 
In another systematic review and meta-analyses survey on liver function during COVID-19, it 
is reported that elevated AST(95% CI 13.6 to 16.5) and ALT(95% CI 13.6 to 16.4) were seen 
in 15% of patients; also, increases in TBIL was seen in 16.7% (95% CI 15.0 to 18.5) of patients. 
Theses upper than normal limit increases were attributed to drug or viral induced hepatic injury. 
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity also was reported with Remdesivir and Favipiravir. Notably, 
Lopinavir/ritonavir liver injury had not been evident in COVID-19 patients, and liver injury 
with Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine reported rare. They not specifically compared these 
increases in non-severe than severe patients (48). 
Some studies also reported that LDH was higher in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. 
LDH is an essential element in glucose metabolism and expressed widely through organ body 
tissues, especially in myocardial and liver cells. LDH would release within cells upon the 
cytoplasmic membrane damage (34). Based on previous studies on SARS and MERS, the 
elevated levels of LDH also were reported. So it can be concluded that LDH independently 
could act as a risk factor with poor clinical outcomes and raised the alarm for further analyses 
(45, 49). The higher levels of LDH maybe is due to the broad expression of ACE2 receptors in 
cardiac blood vessels (27, 50). In another theory, the increased amount of LDH was attributed 
to myositis, which resulted from virus infection (33). Moreover, its amounts would be 
increased as a cause of hepatocyte injuries because of the coexisting of ACE2 receptors in 
hepatocytes. So it's lightening this fact that liver and cardiac damage could occur as a direct 
effect of SARS-Cov-2 on targeted organ damage (34). Thus elevated LDH enzyme in sever 
cases might occur as a consequence of directed hepatic or extrahepatic damage. 
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 could affect lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes (34). 
Patients with damaged T cells are more vulnerable to infections and their risk increase in 
patients with severe illness. The CRP in sever patients had higher levels than non-sever, and 
the CRP level above 100mg/dl could be an alarm for bacterial infection. So higher CRP might 
indicate the risk of other infections (mostly opportunistic infections), which could affect the 
liver or lead to hepatitis, and act as a prognostic factor (51-54). On the other hand, cytokine 
factors that were marked by higher concentrations of CRP, ESR, ferritin, and hs-CRP are 
associated with the severity of COVID-19. As a result, higher amounts of cytokine factors in 
blood serum might suggest a pro-inflammatory factor storm (55). 
Another severe complication that occurred in COVID-19 patients is sepsis, and it could be with 
some clinical and labratorical manifestations. Through labratorical analyses, 
hyperbilirubinemia, acidosis, high lactate, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia were mostly 
seen in COVID-19 patients in ICU (56, 57). Also, as mentioned above, sepsis is one of the liver 
injury causes during infection with SARS-Cov-2. 
Trough abnormal laboratory findings in severely affected patients, aberrant coagulation has 
been reported (58). Also, based on recent studies, it is revealed that COVID-19 is associated

with the classical syndrome named disseminated intravascular coagulation (59) and the 
subsequent consumption coagulopathy (60). The D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product 
which highly increases during DIC (61). Besides, The elevation in D-dimer levels could occur 
as a result of cirrhosis and also are increased gradually as the degree of liver dysfunction 
increases in severity (62, 63). All to gather higher levels of D-dimer with hepatic or 
extrahepatic origin could be act as a prognostic factor for COVID-19. 
Nevertheless, In a study, it is reported that liver indexes such as ALT, AST, TBIL, ALP, ALB, 
GLB, INR, LDH, and CRP hadn't independently any association with the severity of COVID￾19 (43). 
All to gather in this systematic review and meta-analyses, abnormal liver markers where 
different in sever group than the non-sever group. Higher ALT, AST, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, 
and total bilirubin amount and lower albumin altogether but not independently could be a 
prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients. 
The present study has some limitations. All of the studies have been conducted in China, 
whereas covid19 is pandemic now. Interpretation of our meta-analysis findings might be 
limited by the small sample size. limitations on the information provided in studies constrained 
subgroup analysis. 
Conclusion 
The liver because of ACE2 expression in this site is prone to injury as a result of infection with 
SARS-CoV-2. Through our meta-analyzes elevation of some liver, markers were higher in 
sever group when compared to the non-sever group. Also, it is notable that Albumin was 
significantly reduced in severe compared to non-sever patients. Besides some medications were 
used to treatment of COVID-19 patients could be toxic for the liver. Through results, we 
observed significantly considerable numbers of drug-induced liver toxicity in sever group than 
the non-sever group. All to gather in the current study, we assumed that abnormal liver markers 
could act as a prognostic factor for a better survey of COVID-19.
