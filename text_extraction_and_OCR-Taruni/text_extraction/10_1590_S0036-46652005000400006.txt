SUMMARY
The first case of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in Santos (Brazil) leading to septicemia and death of an HIV-positive patient is
reported here. The patient was a 34-year-old female that presented essential fever and was only diagnosed after death by positive
blood culture. The authors underscore the atypical nature of the case, since the patient was a female at fertile age who was born and
had always lived in Santos, which is a nonendemic area for this infection.
KEYWORDS: Paracoccidioidomycosis; Paracoccidioides brasiliensis; Aids.
INTRODUCTION
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis with geographic
distribution limited to Latin America, where Brazil is the country with the
highest number of cases10. This disease has heterogeneous distribution in
Latin America with well-defined endemic areas7
.
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by
progressive immunodeficiency with decreased cellular adaptive response.
This syndrome results in the development of various opportunist
infections, including superficial and deep mycoses2,3. Candida albicans,
Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum are the most
frequently reported opportunistic microorganisms2,8.
AIDS-paracoccidioidomycosis coinfection is rarely reported. To
date, there are only 84 cases in the related literature: 27 cases in a
review published in 19958
; 52 new cases in a review published in 20002
;
two new cases in 200212; one case with eye and CNS infection in 20026
;
one case with oral lesion1
; and another with lung and pleural infection4
.
The present study reports a case of a female patient who was born
and lived in Santos, Brazil, and presented a clinical picture of acquired
immunodeficiency caused by HIV. Although this patient had never
traveled to an endemic area, she presented paracoccidioidomycosis
diagnosed through blood culture. To our knowledge, this is the first
case to be reported in Santos14.
CASE REPORT
A.L.P., 34-year-old, Caucasian, female, intravenous drug user,
prostitute, was born and resident in Santos, Brazil. In February 1997,
the patient was admitted to the Guilherme Álvaro Hospital of Santos
and was presumptively diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and
pulmonary tuberculosis based on her clinical and radiographic signs
and symptoms. The patient was then transferred to CRAIDS (AIDS
Reference Center, Santos, Brazil) for outpatient treatment. At the first
physical examination, the patient presented stomatitis, indicating oral
candidiasis, with adenomegaly in the anterior and posterior cervical
regions. The spleen was percussible but not palpable, and the liver
edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory examination
showed a CD4+ cell count of 41 cells/mm3
. Specific therapy with anti￾AIDS drug cocktail (3CT, d4T and EFV) was initiated due to the HIV/
AIDS infection and pulmonary tuberculosis - considering both the
clinical picture and radiological aspect, but without bacteriological
confirmation. The patient did not fully comply with the therapy, which
was interrupted repeatedly. In July 2000, she sought help again with a
clinical picture of continuous fever, asthenia and loss of 12 kg over the
previous three months. At physical examination, the patient presented
severe oropharyngeal candidiasis and generalized adenomegaly. The
spleen was palpable one cm below the left costal margin; the liver
edge was 3 cm below the right costal margin. No skin lesions were
observed. Laboratory tests showed severe anemia and leukopenia. The
patient presented a hemoglobin level of 6.9 and 1,100 leukocytes, which
were not differentially diagnosed because of the leukopenia. After two
600 mL transfusions of blood cell concentrate, the patient presented,
on September 14, 2000, a hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL and 1,700
leukocytes, of which 65% were segmented and 11% were lymphocytes.
She presented a CD4 count of 6 cells/mm3
, a CD8 count of 151 cells/
mm3 and a CD3 count of 158 cells/mm3
 on February 23, 2000 and viral
load of 350,000 copies/mL. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial
infiltrate. Once again, the patient was presumptively treated for
tuberculosis and suspected pneumocystosis with a priming dose of

Paulo State, Brazil - a nonendemic area. Rev. Inst. Med. trop. S. Paulo, 47(4):209-211, 2005.
sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim, 100 mg per kg of body weight per
day in four fractional doses for 21 days. Despite this therapy, her overall
condition deteriorated dramatically. In addition to the therapy, she was
also treated in a day hospital with resumption of antiretroviral therapy
and several blood transfusions. Various blood cultures for bacteria and
mycobacteria were performed and the results were negative. CD4 cell
count was 6 cells/mm3
. In spite of outpatient clinic and day-hospital
support, the patient’s condition continued to worsen. New blood cultures
were performed, including blood culture for fungi on transport medium
(Negroni). Faced with her severe clinical picture, she was readmitted
to hospital on October 28, 2000 and died on November 11, 2000. Blood
was cultivated on BHIA medium, and after 35 days a slow-growing
fungus in the yeast stage was isolated. This fungus was subsequently
identified as Paracoccidioides brasiliensis14.
DISCUSSION
The Ministry of Health11 reports a total of 310,310 cases of AIDS
in Brazil; candidiasis ranks first in number of related mycosis cases,
while neurocryptococcosis ranks sixth. No reference has been made to
paracoccidioidomycosis.
Among the cases described in the related literature, BERNARD &
DUARTE2
, in a comprehensive review carried out in 2000, reported
high prevalence of HIV-PCM coinfection in patients with risk factors
for HIV. Among the cases reported, 51% were intravenous drug users,
which indicates that IV drug use is a risk factor for PCM in both endemic
and nonendemic areas when some of the individuals involved in needle￾sharing are from endemic regions. With regard to the clinical picture
of HIV-PCM coinfection among the 56 patients studied, disseminated
disease was observed in 77%; enlarged lymph nodes, especially
cervical, in 73%; hepatomegaly in 43%; splenomegaly in 29%;
osteoarticular lesion in 18%; and enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes
in 16%. This distribution is in accordance with the acute form of the
disease observed in HIV-negative patients2
.
HADAD et al.9
 (1992) analyzed a case of HIV-PCM coinfection
with positive blood culture and observed that although this disease
presented hematogenous dissemination, it was difficult to isolate the
fungus from blood culture.
In the present case, there were non-specific pulmonary signs and
symptoms with mild interstitial infiltrate, presumptively diagnosed and
treated as pulmonary tuberculosis, although over 20 examinations and
BAAR cultures had tested negative. It is noteworthy that, as of July,
she presented essential fever, severe recurrent anemia and leukopenia.
The patient had no cutaneous or oral mucosa lesions.
The authors point out the atypical nature of the case with regard to its
epidemiology. We have observed and reported the first autochthonous case
of paracoccidioidomycosis in the city of Santos, an urban area on the
coast of Brazil, which is not related to endemic areas. The patient affirmed
that she had always lived in Santos and had never traveled to endemic
areas. However, she did report sharing needles with other drug users from
different parts of São Paulo State. It is also noteworthy that the patient was
female, since according to BERNARD & DUARTE literature review2
, the
prevalence ratio of HIV-PCM coinfection between men and women was
3.3:1, which may be related to a possible protective effect from β-estradiol13.
The authors emphasize that it is likely that there have been other
undiagnosed cases, as AIDS patients may present various diseases with
a similar clinical course and which are more often described in the
literature. The possibility of systemic fungal infections should be
considered whenever there is a clinical picture of prolonged fever,
lymphadenopathy and pulmonary interstitial infiltrate shown by chest
x-ray. In such cases, at least one blood culture for fungi should be
performed.
RESUMO
Septicemia por Paracoccidioides brasilienses (Lutz, 1908) como
causa de morte em paciente com síndrome da imunodeficiência
adquirida (sida), procedente de área não endêmica, Santos, SP,
Brasil
Relata-se o primeiro caso de Paracoccidioides brasiliensis,
causando septicemia e morte em um paciente HIV positivo de 34 anos,
do sexo feminino, natural e procedente de Santos, S.P.. A paciente
apresentava-se com quadro febril inespecífico sendo que o diagnóstico
só foi realizado pós morte da paciente através da positividade da
hemocultura. Os autores chamam a atenção para a atipia do caso no
que se refere ao fato de ser uma mulher em idade fértil e que nasceu e
sempre residiu em Santos, área não endêmica para esta infecção.
