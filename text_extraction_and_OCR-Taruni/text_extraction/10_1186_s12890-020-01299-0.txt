Abstract
Background: Anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody testing was approved by the Japanese government in
2018. As such, there was no longitudinal data regarding the HLA-sensitization of lung transplant (LTX) patients in
Japan. We therefore set out to measure anti-HLA antibodies from all our LTX patients during their annual follow-up
to characterize the sensitization status in the Japanese population.
Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted for consecutive LTX recipients who underwent transplantation
from January 2000 to January 2020 at Tohoku University Hospital (TUH). The serum from the recipients was
screened for anti-HLA antibody with the panel-reactive assay (PRA) and the donor-specific antibodies (DSA).
Results: Sensitization was reviewed in 93 LTX recipients, showing 23 positive (24.7%) and 70 negative (75.3%) PRA.
More sensitized recipients were found in recent transplantations (60.9% (14/23), ≤5 years post LTX) than in older
transplantations (17.4% (4/23), 5–10 years or 21.7% (5/23), ≥10 years post LTX) (p = 0.04). Even fewer recipients had
DSA (5.4%, 5/93), among whom 4/5 (80%) were recently transplanted.
Conclusion: The rate of PRA positive LTX recipients in our population was lower compared with those in previous
reports from US and Europe. More sensitized LTRs were found in recent transplantations than the older cohort, and
DSA was identified primarily in the recent recipients. Due to several limitations, it is still unclear whether the
sensitization would be related the development of CLAD or survival, yet this study would be fundamental to the
future anti-HLA body study in Japanese population.

Backgrond
Japan has taken steps towards increasing number of do￾nors and recipients and lung transplantation (LTX) has
become a standard clinical practice for patients with ad￾vanced respiratory disease. Due to severe shortage of
donor organs, the country has a unique profile in trans￾plantation [1] such that the number of unilateral LTX
outnumbers that of the bilateral. In addition, an upper
age limit has been set for the registry of transplantation
(younger than 60 years old for the unilateral transplant
and 55 for the bilateral) and living-donor lobar LTX is
considered an ethically justifiable procedure and still ac￾counts for 10–20% of transplants [1].
The role of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against
class I and II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) has gained
increasing attention in LTX. Development of DSA is as￾sociated with increased chronic lung allograft dysfunc￾tion (CLAD) and morbidity and mortality in LTX
recipients [2–4]. In Japan, there is no data regarding the
HLA-sensitization of LTX patients until 2018 as anti￾HLA antibody testing was not covered by the govern￾ment. Therefore, there is no existing knowledge on the
postoperative sensitization status of LTX recipients in
Japan.
In this study, we set out to serially measure anti-HLA
antibodies from all our LTX patients during their yearly
follow-up to characterize the sensitization status in our
post LTX population.
Methods
Study design and data collection
All LTX recipients (LTR) who underwent transplant￾ation from January 2000 to January 2020 at Tohoku Uni￾versity Hospital (TUH) were consecutively included in
the analysis. The cross-sectional study was conducted
between January 2019 and January 2020, when the anti￾HLA antibody was measured in LTRs who visited the
annual assessment. LTRs were fully assessed at months
3 and 6 post-transplant and thereafter annually. Partici￾pants’ clinical details at the time of transplant were
reviewed from the medical records, and the current sta￾tus of lung function was assessed when the blood sample
was collected. The study protocol was reviewed by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Tohoku University
Hospital (IRB number 2019-01-54). In light of the retro￾spective design, the requirement of informed consent
was waived. We disclosed information on the implemen￾tation of the research and ensured the opportunity for
research subjects to refuse participation by posting the
information disclosure materials approved by the Ethics
Committee on the website of the Graduate School of
Medicine, Tohoku University.
Anti-HLA antibody test
The serum from the recipients was screened for anti￾HLA antibody with Flow PRA (One Lambda, Inc.,
Canoga Park, CA). The LTR was considered sensitized
when the panel-reactive assay (PRA) was positive
(greater than 0%) and regarded unsensitized when PRA
was negative. The sensitized recipients were further
tested for donor-specific antibody (DSA) with LABSc￾reen single-antigen beads (One Lambda, Inc.). The posi￾tive DSA was defined by mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) units greater than 1000 or more. The
complement-binding function in DSA was measured
with C1q Screen (One Lambda Inc.). The test for anti￾HLA antibody was done in ReproCELL Japan Inc.
Yokohama.
HLA testing in Japan
Pre-transplant PRA was not covered by the government
and not routinely measured in LTX candidates so far. At
the time of transplant, HLA typing at A, B and DRB1
loci was measured in both a donor and recipients, with
additional loci typing in our center since 2018. Prior to
transplant performed, complement dependent cytotox￾icity (CDC) T cell cross-match using current or historic
sera needs to be carried out without dithiothreitol
(DTT) reduction, which is applied for transplant
decision-making; the candidates must be negative in
CDC cross-match. For the time being, CDC B cell cross￾match and flow cytometry cross-match are not routinely
performed in Japan. As HLA typing at HLA-C and
DQB1 in donors has not been measured until 2018, Cw￾and DQ-DSA were not fully assessed in this cohort.
Immunosuppression protocol and acute allograft
rejection
Induction of immunosuppression was achieved using
basiliximab. Maintenance of immunosuppression con￾sists of tacrolimus targeting the trough level of 10–14
ng/ml for the first 6 months, 9–13 ng/ml up to 12
months and 8–10 ng/ml thereafter, mycophenolic acid
with 1000 mg for < 50 kg or 1500 mg ≥ 50 kg as tolerated
and prednisone 1.0 mg/kg for the first 4 days, followed
by 0.8 mg/kg for 4 days and gradually tapered to 5 mg.
When LTRs could not tolerate tacrolimus or mycophe￾nolic acid, cyclosporine or azathioprine is the alternative,
respectively. Acute allograft rejection, considered when
acutely dropped lung function without episodes of infec￾tion or mechanical factors such as airway stenosis,
pleural effusion or native lung hyperinflation, was
treated with bolus of methylprednisolone 500 mg for 3
consecutive days, followed by tapering doses of prednis￾one back to 5 mg. Surveillance bronchoscopy was not
routinely scheduled at TUH.

Definition of CLAD
Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was defined as
a substantial (≥20%) and persistent (≥3 months) decline in
FEV1 from the baseline which is the mean of the best 2
post-operative FEV1 (taken > 3 weeks apart) in a lung
transplant recipient (LTR) survived ≥3 months [5].
Definition of CLAD subtypes
Restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) was defined by a
concomitant (≥10%) decline in TLC from the baseline
which is the mean of the best 2 post-operative TLC
(taken > 3 weeks apart) and persistent opacities on thor￾acic CT among those who developed CLAD [6]. Bron￾chiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is defined by the
presence of the airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC ratio <
0.70) among those who developed CLAD. Mixed pheno￾type is defined by both features of RAS (≥10% decline of
TLC) and BOS (FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70) among LTRs
with CLAD. Undefined is considered when phenotype of
CLAD is difficult to be categorized among patients with
CLAD [5].
Statistical analysis
Categoric variables were reported as percentages, and
continuous variables as medians (interquartile range
(IQR)) as appropriate. Differences between groups were
assessed with chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for cat￾egoric variables and Mann Whitney test (two groups) or
Kruskal-Wallis (three groups) as appropriate for con￾tinuous variables. Statistical analyses were performed
using EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical Uni￾versity, Omiya, Japan), which is a graphical user interface
for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria), where a two-sided P value was calcu￾lated. Graph generation was performed with GraphPad
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).
Results
Up until January 2020, 760 LTX comprising 526
deceased-donor and 234 living-donor have been per￾formed in Japan, of which TUH accounted for 17.1%
(130/760). Of those, LTRs who have passed away (n =
30) and could not participated in the annual assessment
(n = 5) were excluded from the study. The initial trans￾plantation in re-transplanted recipients were also ex￾cluded (n = 2) (Fig. 1). Sensitization was then reviewed
in the rest of 93 patients, showing 23 positive (24.7%)
and 70 negative (75.3%) PRA. The principal analyses
were to compare PRA+ (n = 23) with PRA- recipients
(n = 70), summarized in the main tables. The secondary
analyses were, although the number was small, to see re￾cipients who developed the donor-specific antibody
(DSA)(n = 5), carried non-DSA anti-HLA antibody (n =
18) and did not possess anti-HLA antibody (n = 70),
summarized in supplemental files.
The patients’ characteristics at the time of transplant￾ation were summarized (Table 1). The median age in
LTRs at the time of transplantation was 42 (IQR 32–50),
and 57.0% (53/93) were female (Table 1). At THU, the
single transplant was the major LTX procedure at 51.6%
(48/93). The obstructive lung disease was the most re￾sponsible for the LTX indication at 41.9% (39/93),
followed by pulmonary vascular disease at 22.6% (21/93)
and restrictive lung disease at 20.4% (19/93). There was
no statistic difference in age, gender, LTX procedure
and LTX indication between PRA+ and PRA- LTRs (p =

0.423, 1.000, 0.935 and 0.282, respectively). Pre￾transplant comorbidities including diabetes (hemoglobin
A1c > 6.5%), connective tissue disease, chronic kidney
disease (the glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73
m2) [7] and gastroesophageal reflux disease (typical
symptoms and endoscopic changes) [8], were also
assessed in PRA+ and PRA- groups without significance
(p = 1.000, 0.100, 0.590 and 1.000, respectively). In sec￾ondary analyses, no statistic difference was found in age,
gender, LTX procedure, LTX indication and pre￾transplant comorbidities among DSA+, non-DSA anti￾HLA antibody and PRA- recipients (Supplemental
Table 1).
The transplant surgery was then reviewed (Table 2).
Donor age (≤19, 20–59, ≥60 years old), operative time
(≤419, 420–839, ≥840 min) and total ischemic time
(≤419, 420–599, ≥600 min) were partitioned and com￾pared in PRA+ and PRA- groups, without statistic differ￾ence (p = 0.09, 0.900 and 0.861, respectively). CMV
mismatch was seen less in PRA+ (4.3%) than in PRA- re￾cipients (21.4%) without significance (p = 0.06). Recently
transplanted recipients (≤5 years post LTX) had a higher
proportion of positive PRA (60.9% (14/23)) compared to
patients transplanted in earlier eras with 17.4% (4/23) in
5–10 years and 21.7% (5/23) in ≥10 years post LTX (p =
0.04). In secondary analyses, altogether 5 patients had
DSA, 4/5 (80%) were recently transplanted while the
remaining patient (20%) was 5–10 years post LTX. There
was no positive DSA in in recipients seen ≥10 years post
LTX (Supplemental Table 2).
From the standpoint of HLA sensitization, pregnancy,
transfusion and prior transplant are generally considered
risk factors [9, 10]. Thus, a history of pregnancy, blood
transfusion and prior transplant were reviewed. This re￾vealed no association of these factors with positive PRA
(p = 0.280, 0.443 and 0.331, respectively) (Table 3). Add￾itionally, there was no difference in those episodes for
the development of DSA (Supplemental Table 3). On
the other hand, HLA-A, B and DR alleles in both recipi￾ent and donor(s) were available for analysis in 53 LTX
cases, and the number of HLA mismatch was counted.
The 0–2 mismatch (0–2/6 in deceased-donor or 0–4/12
in living-donor) was found in 7 LTRs, of whom 6
(85.7%) were living-donor transplants. Meanwhile, posi￾tive DSA was seen only in the 5–6 HLA mismatch. Yet,
there was no significance in the number of HLA mis￾matches among PRA+/− recipients (p = 0.796) (Table 3)
as well as among DSA+, non-DSA anti-HLA antibody
and PRA- recipients (p = 0.509) (Supplemental Table 3).
The lung function was assessed while the annual as￾sessment in LTRs who survived at least 1-year post
transplant (n = 84) (Table 4). CLAD was found in 20.2%
(17/84) of the recipients, among whom 11.8% (2/17)
were PRA+ and 88.2% (15/17) were PRA- (p = 0.190).
RAS accounted for 29.4% (5/17), BOS for 41.1% (7/17),
mixed phenotype for 23.5% (4/17) and unclassified for
5.9% (1/17) (data not shown). In secondary analyses, no
recipients diagnosed with CLAD had DSA. Antibodies in
2 sensitized recipients who were diagnosed with CLAD
were non-DSA anti-HLA antibodies (Supplemental
Table 4).
The detail of PRA and DSA in sensitized patients (n =
23) were summarized (Table 5). Of 23 participants, the
number of LTRs with sensitization only to HLA class 1
was 9 (39.1%), of whom 3 were highly sensitized (> 25%)
[11, 12] and 2 have DSA (Cw4 and B52/B59). On the
other hand, the number of recipients who had only anti￾HLA antibodies class 2 were 5 (21.7%), of whom no one
showed PRA over 25% but one recipient had DSA
(DR4). Nine sensitized LTRs with anti-HLA antibodies
against both HLA class 1 and 2 (39.1%) were found,
among whom 7 were highly sensitized and 2 had DSA
(DR4 and DQ9). No DSA found in the study period had
C1q-binding activities.

Discussion
The status of HLA-sensitization post transplantation
was reviewed in a lung transplant center in Japan. Some￾what surprisingly, only 24.7% (23/93) Japanese recipients
were PRA positive. Even fewer recipients had DSA
(5.4%, 5/93), which was far lower than that of other
transplant facilities, e.g. over 80% of 320 lung transplant
recipients were sensitized and around a half had devel￾oped DSA within 2 years post-transplantation in To￾ronto, Canada [2], 50.1% (105/206) of recipients
transplanted within a year had DSA in Suresnes, France
[3] and 63.9% (124/194) in LTRs developed DSA in Dal￾las, United States [13]. However, the data shown in this
study is a snapshot of a single and often remote time
point from the LTX operation. Therefore, careful atten￾tion should be paid in interpreting our result with low
prevalence of sensitization and DSA in our cohort.
Throughout the study, more sensitized LTRs were
found in recent transplantations (≤5 years post LTX)
than the earlier (5–10 years or ≥ 10 years post LTX), and
the majority of recipients who carried DSA were the re￾cent cases but not in the older ones. This can be possible
survival bias that some of earlier recipients may have
died owing to graft failure without ever knowing about
DSA and we thus have seen less sensitized recipients in
the older cohort. To further elucidate the possible bias,
the cause of death was reviewed among those who died
after transplant (n = 30) (Supplemental Table 5). Of
those, 24 were found with an obvious cause of death
which was highly unlikely to be related to antibody￾mediated rejection (AMR). As transplantation was not
scheduled when there was a positive CDC crossmatch,
humoral rejection due to pre-existing DSA (hyper-acute
rejection) was also unlikely in cases with primary graft
dysfunction. Presence of DSA could not be denied in 6
recipients, of whom 3 CLAD cases and 1 unknown were
transplanted in the earlier (> 5 years). Even in the sce￾nario where those 4 LTRs may have died with AMR, the
influence of DSA to death is still small in those popula￾tion. Given the low incidence of sensitization, long sur￾vival and little impact of DSA to death, it is conceivable
that the earlier recipients were less sensitized, with
which the survival bias may be implausible. Instead, this
raised the assumption that positive PRA or DSA could
be higher in the recent cases but not in the older cohort
in the population.
This could be explained if recipients surviving > 5
years post LTX might have transiently developed DSA
that disappeared thereafter and are currently recognized
as unsensitized. The study done in Houston, United
States [14] indicated that transient de novo DSA was
commonly seen and associated with a lower risk of post￾LTX acute rejection than that of persistent de novo
DSA. Similarly, the study from Munich, Germany [15]

showed that persistent DSA was associated with reduced
survival compared with transient DSA. Given these facts,
our earlier cases might have had transient DSA and cur￾rently undetectable DSA, and thus show longer survival.
However, it is unclear from the study design whether
LTRs in our center have had DSA before or after trans￾plant since PRA and DSA are time-dependent variables.
To make those above questions more clear, a longitu￾dinal study with repeated measurement of PRA and
DSA before and after transplantation is needed. Yet, this
study should be fundamental for future trials in Japan as
it underlines our need to better understand our LTX
population.
Based on the National Marrow Donor Program [16],
HLA allele frequency varies by race and ethnicity in the
US Population. With those features in mind, it should
be interesting to evaluate the status of sensitization and
DSA frequency in the Japanese population with a large￾scale analysis as they have relatively little genetic diver￾sity, with the notable exception of the Okinawa region
[17]. In our center, the 0–2 HLA mismatch was only
seen in living-donor LTX recipients who were PRA
negative (Table 3), while positive DSA was seen only in
the 5–6 HLA mismatch. However, it is inconclusive
whether the number of mismatches is associated with
HLA-sensitization as the sample size was too small to
show statistical difference in the study. Meanwhile, it is
worthwhile to see the HLA-DQ mismatches in the
population that drives de novo DSA in LTX [18]. Des￾pite our data, de novo DSA are common after LTX and
associated with an increased risk of CLAD. However,
HLA typing at DQ loci is not mandatory for transplant
matching for the time being and has not been routinely
investigated in Japan. To pursue the role of DQ match￾ing between a recipient and donors, consecutive meas￾urement of HLA loci will be required in the next study.
Given the cross-sectional analysis in a single-center,
we have several limitations that warrant discussion. First,
the number of LTX recipients is still in short for ana￾lysis. Despite the transplant circumstance changing in
Japan, the shortage of organ donors is one of the largest
issues in all solid organ transplantation [1–19]. Analysis
was done in sensitized vs non-sensitized recipients, ra￾ther than positive vs negative DSA, due to the small
sample number. To overcome this, the multicenter study
would benefit from seeing the impact of DSA in Japa￾nese population. Second, a universal health care insur￾ance system in Japan began to cover the fee of anti-HLA
antibody among LTX recipients in April 2018. Thus,
little has been known about the status of sensitization in
LTX candidates when registered and that of DSA in
LTRs throughout the country. The successive measure￾ment of DSA in LTR could be a fundamental data to
analyze the relationship of de novo DSA to CLAD.
Although some limitations are need to be addressed, this
is the first report documenting the sensitization status
and DSA in LTX recipients, so that provides valuable tip
to other transplant centers in Japan.
Conclusions
To sum up, the rate of PRA positive LTRs in the
Japanese population was lower compared with those in
previous reports from US and Europe. More sensitized
LTRs were found in recent transplantations than the
older cohort, and DSA was identified in the recent re￾cipients. Due to several limitations, it is still unclear
whether the sensitization would be related to the deve￾lopment of CLAD or survival, yet this study would be
fundamental to the future anti-HLA body study in
Japanese population.
