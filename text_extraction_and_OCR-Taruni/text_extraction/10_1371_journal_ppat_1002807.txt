Abstract
The role of the E6 oncoprotein from high-risk members of the a human papillomavirus genus in anogenital cancer has been
well established. However, far less is known about the E6 protein from the b human papillomavirus genus (b-HPVs). Some b￾HPVs potentially play a role in non-melanoma skin cancer development, although they are not required for tumor
maintenance. Instead, they may act as a co-factor that enhances the carcinogenic potential of UV damage. Indeed, the E6
protein from certain b-HPVs (HPV 5 and 8) promotes the degradation of p300, a histone acetyl transferase involved in UV
damage repair. Here, we show that the expression of HPV 5 and 8 E6 increases thymine dimer persistence as well as the
likelihood of a UVB induced double strand break (DSB). Importantly, we provide a mechanism for the increased DNA
damage by showing that both extended thymine dimer persistence as well as elevated DSB levels are dependent on the
ability of HPV 8 E6 to promote p300 degradation. We further demonstrate that HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression reduces the
mRNA and protein levels of ATR, a PI3 kinase family member that plays a key role in UV damage signaling, but that these
levels remain unperturbed in cells expressing a mutated HPV 8 E6 incapable of promoting p300 degradation. We confirm
that the degradation of p300 leads to a reduction in ATR protein levels, by showing that ATR levels rebound when a p300
mutant resistant to HPV 8 mediated degradation and HPV 8 E6 are co-transfected. Conversely, we show that ATR protein
levels are reduced when p300 is targeted for degradation by siRNA. Moreover, we show the reduced ATR levels in HPV 5 and
8 E6 expressing cells results in delayed ATR activation and an attenuated ability of cells to phosphorylate, and as a result
accumulate, p53 in response to UVB exposure, leading to significantly reduced cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, these data
demonstrate that b-HPV E6 expression can enhance the carcinogenic potential of UVB exposure by promoting p300
degradation, resulting in a reduction in ATR levels, which leads to increased thymine dimer persistence and increased UVB
induced DSBs.

Introduction
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a large family of double
stranded DNA viruses that infect the cutaneous and mucosal
epidermis of humans. This family of viruses is divided, based on
DNA sequence homology, into 5 genera [1]. Of these genera,
alpha human papillomaviruses (a-HPV) are the most commonly
studied due to the association of some a-HPVs with anogenital
cancers [2,3]. Members of the a-HPV genus include both low risk
(HPV types 6 and 11) and high risk (HPV types 16 and 18) types,
designated to denote their likelihood of inducing a carcinoma.
While low risk a-HPV (LR a-HPV) infections are most often
associated with more benign conditions such as genital warts, high
risk a-HPV (HR a-HPV) infections have been established as the
causative agent of nearly all cervical and a subset of head and neck
cancers [2–4]. Recently, members of the b human papillomavirus
(b-HPV) genus (particularly HPV types 5 and 8) have gained
increasing interest due to a potential association with non￾melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [5–9]. Since the b-HPV viruses
do not seem to be necessary for tumor maintenance, they may act
as co-factors to increase the mutagenic potential of UV exposure
[8,10].
Most HPV genera express 8 genes, which are categorized as
either early (E) or late (L), based on when they are expressed
during the viral life cycle. Two early HPV gene products, HPV E6
and HPV E7, are particularly well characterized and considered
the primary oncogenes in HR a-HPVs [11,12]. Some functions of
the E6 protein are conserved between HR and LR a-HPVs, such
as the ability to bind E6AP and degrade the pro-apoptotic Bak
protein [13–18]. However, the ability to activate telomerase,
degrade p53, and associate with multiple PDZ domain containing
proteins functionally differentiates these two classes of E6 proteins
[19–28]. Not surprisingly, the LR and HR a-HPV E6 proteins
have sequence heterogeneity associated with these functional
differences such as the presence of a PDZ binding domain in HR
a-HPV E6 that is absent in LR a-HPV E6 proteins [29].
Unlike the a-HPV E6 proteins, considerably less is known about
b-HPV E6 proteins. Similar to a-HPVs, b-HPV E6 proteins are
capable of binding to and degrading Bak [30,31]. Additionally,
like HR a-HPV E6 proteins, b-HPV E6 proteins can bind to the
cellular histone acetyl transferase (HAT), p300 [32–35]. Some b￾HPV E6 proteins bind p300 more strongly, blocking phosphor￾ylation by AKT, resulting in destabilization of p300 [36]. Finally,
like the LR a-HPV E6s, b-HPV E6 proteins lack a PDZ binding

domain and as a result are unable to target PDZ domain proteins
for degradation.
Perhaps the biggest difference between HR a-HPV E6 and b￾HPV E6 proteins is the ability of HR a-HPV E6 protein to
degrade p53, a function lacking in b-HPV E6 proteins. Instead,
the b-HPV 38 E6 can instead attenuate p53 signaling by inducing
the expression of deltaNp73 [37], a dominant negative inhibitor of
p53. Additionally HPV 5 and 8 E6 promote the degradation of
p300 potentially abrogating its ability to acetylate p53 in response
to UV damage [38]. Furthermore, b-HPV E6 expression has been
shown to result in persistence of thymine dimers following UVB
exposure [39].
Typically in response to UVB exposure a PI3 kinase family
member, ATR, phosphorylates p53, blocking MDM2 mediated
proteosomal degradation and allowing p53 to accumulate and
activate genes involved in DNA damage repair as well as cell cycle
arrest [40–46]. p300 associates with ATR and its acetyl transferase
activity is required for ATR to phosphorylate one of its
downstream kinase targets, CHK1, providing evidence for a
functional relationship between p300 and ATR [47]. In this work,
we report that cells expressing HPV 5 and 8 E6 proteins that are
capable of promoting p300 degradation have reduced ATR levels
and activation, while ATR levels are unperturbed in cells
expressing HPV D8 E6, an E6 mutant that cannot promote
p300 degradation. We provide additional support for the
connection between ATR and p300 by demonstrating that ATR
levels are similar to control levels when cells are co-transfected
with HPV 8 E6 and a mutated p300 resistant to HPV 8 E6
promoted degradation. Conversely, ATR levels are reduced in
cells transfected with p300 targeting siRNA.
The reduction in ATR expression attenuates ATR activity
resulting in decreased phosphorylation of p53. Reduced p53
phosphorylation delays p53 accumulation following UVB expo￾sure. We also show that b-HPV E6 expression leads to reduced G1
arrest following UVB exposure, allowing more cells to enter S￾phase with damaged DNA. The collision of a replication fork with
a bulky thymine dimer can cause the fork to collapse into a
deleterious double stranded break (DSB) in DNA [48]. Impor￾tantly, we demonstrate that b-HPV E6 expression increases the
likelihood of DSB formation following UVB exposure. In HPV 5
and 8 E6 expressing cells, UVB induced DSBs persist for
significantly longer and occur approximately four times more
frequently. Finally, the decreased ability of b-HPV E6 expressing
cells to repair UVB induced DNA damage results in increased
sensitivity to UVB.
Results
b HPV E6 expression increases thymine dimer persistence
and DSB levels following UVB
UVB induced thymine dimer repair has previously been shown
to be significantly delayed in cells expressing HPV 5 E6 and HR a￾HPV 18 E6 [39]. To determine if the expression of other HPV E6
proteins could also increase thymine dimer persistence, we first
expressed 3 b-HPV E6 (5, 8, and 38 E6) and 1 HR a-HPV E6 (16
E6) in human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) cells and HT1080
cells. HPV E6 expression was confirmed using semi quantitative
RT-PCR (Figure S1). We examined the cells for the presence of
thymine dimers by immunofluorescent microscopy and quantitat￾ed the number of cells staining positive for thymine dimers above
background and were able to confirm that HPV 5 E6 expression
resulted in increased persistence of thymine dimers [39] and
showed that HPV 8 and 16 E6 expression also resulted in this
phenotype (Figure 1A, 1B, and Figure S2). Indeed, although the
peak number of cells positive for thymine dimer occurred rapidly
after UVB exposure (less than one hour after exposure) and was
similar among the cell lines, a significantly higher percentage of
HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6 expressing cells maintained elevated thymine
dimer levels three hours after UVB exposure. Interestingly,
thymine dimer persistence in HPV 38 E6 expressing cells was
most similar to vector control cells. Thymine dimers persisted far
longer in HPV 16 E6 expressing HFK and HT1080 cells than the
other cell lines. Over 40% of 16 E6 expressing HFKs and over
25% of HPV 16 E6 expressing HT1080 cells were positive for
thymine dimers after all other cells lines returned to background
thymine dimer levels (8 hours for HFKs, and 12 hours for
HT1080 cells). Notably, thymine dimers persisted far longer in
HT1080 cells than in HFK cells, perhaps due to the transformed
nature of HT1080 cells.
To determine whether persistence of thymine dimers in b-HPV
E6 expressing cells was due to an increased number of thymine
dimers forming in response to the same dose of UVB, we
quantified thymine dimer formation directly using antibody
specific for the lesion in response to a gradient of UVB exposures
ranging from 0 to 25 mJ/cm2
. Thymine dimer formation varied
minimally between HPV E6 expressing cells lines and control cells,
(Figure S3) indicating that altered thymine dimer formation did
not explain the substantially increased persistence of thymine
dimers in HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6 expressing cells. Since nucleotide
excision repair (NER) is the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway
responsible for the repair of UVB induced thymine dimers [49],
these data suggest that NER is attenuated in HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6
expressing cells.
Persistent thymine dimers can result in the collapse of
replication forks into double strand breaks (DSBs) if they remain
unrepaired as a cell progresses through S phase [48]. We therefore
hypothesized that the increased longevity of thymine dimers in b￾HPV E6 expressing cells would result in increased UV induced
DSB formation in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured
levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX, a commonly used marker
of DSBs [50], in HPV E6 expressing cells following UV exposure.
Importantly, in both HFK and HT1080 cells expressing HPV 5, 8,
and 16 E6 significantly more cells showed evidence of a DSB than
vector control cells (Figure 1C, 1D and Figure S4). Also, this
increased damage persisted for significantly longer. Vector control
cells peaked with approximately 15% of the cells positive for
Author Summary
Human papillomaviruses are a large family of viruses that
can cause ailments ranging from benign warts to
anogenital cancer. Recently, interest has increased for a
subgroup of these viruses, the b-HPVs, because of their
potential involvement in squamous cell skin cancer. In this
work, we show that the E6 protein from two of these
viruses (HPV 5 and 8) is able to increase the damage that
UV exposure causes to the host cell’s DNA. The E6 protein
from these viruses promotes the degradation of p300, a
cellular protein involved in DNA damage repair. This in
turn reduces amounts of another cellular protein, ATR,
which facilitates the process of signaling the cell to repair
its damaged DNA. The decrease in ATR levels delays the
cell’s recognition of the damaged DNA, allowing thymine
dimers to remain unrepaired longer and more often
leading to a double strand break in the DNA. Together,
our data show that the b HPVs can cause UV exposures to
be more deleterious to host cell DNA, potentially increas￾ing the likelihood that these cells become cancerous.

phosphorylated H2AX 1.5 hours after UVB exposure and these
levels returned to background by 16 hours. Despite having similar
baseline levels of H2AX phosphorylation (data not shown), HPV 5
and 8 E6 expressing cells remained at peak levels, approximately
20% of cells staining positive for phosphorylated H2AX, 8 hours
after UVB exposure. HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells maintained
elevate levels for over 24 hours following UVB exposure. A greatly
increased number of HPV 16 E6 cells had phosphorylated H2AX
12 hours after UVB exposure, with approximately 40% of the cells
positive. The levels of phosphorylated H2AX also persist longer in
HPV 16 E6 expressing cells. 24 hours after UVB exposure, HPV
16 E6 expressing cells had a high percentage of cells staining
positive for phosphorylated H2AX than control cells experience at
their peak levels. Similar to what we observed when measuring
thymine dimers following UV exposure, HPV 38 E6 expressing
HT1080 cells had more cells with DSBs than vector control cells at
3 hours in HT1080 cells and at 4 hours in HFK cells after UVB
exposure, but they were more similar to vector control cells than
HPV 5, 8, or 16 E6 expressing cells (Figure 1C, D and Figure S4).
To determine if UVB induced phosphorylation of H2AX was
consistent with a model where DSBs occur following UVB
exposure as a result of replication fork collapse following collision
with an unrepaired thymine dimer, we compared the temporal
relationship between thymine dimer formation and phospho
H2AX staining. For each cell line we tested, the peak number of
cells staining positive for thymine dimers occurred either before or
at the same time as the peak number of cells positive for phospho￾H2AX (Figure 2). These data suggest that while thymine dimers
can occur either before or at the same time as UVB induced DSBs,
UVB induced double strand breaks do not occur before the
formation of thymine dimers.
b HPV E6 mediated increased thymine dimer persistence
and elevated DSB levels in cells following UVB exposure
is dependent on p300 degradation
HPV 5 and 8 E6 promote the degradation of p300 [36], a key
HAT involved in UVB damage response [51–53]. Indeed, p300
levels were reduced in HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing HFK cells (data
not shown) that had elevated thymine dimer persistence and
phospho-H2AX levels following UVB exposure. To determine if
the increase in thymine dimer persistence and phospho H2AX

levels in these cell lines was related to their ability to degrade p300,
we measured thymine dimer persistence and phospho H2AX
levels in HFK cells expressing a mutant of HPV 8 E6 (HPV D8 E6)
that is incapable of degrading p300 but maintains other functions
such as its ability to activate the HPV 8 promoter [32]. Thymine
dimer removal in HPV D8 E6 expressing cells was not significantly
different from vector control HFK cells (Figure 3A). Phospho
H2AX levels in D8 E6 HFK cells were also similar to the levels
seen in cells with normal p300 levels (Figure 3B).
b HPV E6 expression increases sensitivity to crosslinking
agents
We have shown that NER is disrupted in HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6
expressing cells (Figure 1A, B). Since NER is responsible for the
repair of UVB induced DNA lesions, we hypothesized that UVB
exposure would be more deleterious in cells expressing these HPV
E6s. In these cells, we determined cellular viability by measuring the
number of cells 3 days following exposure to a gradient of UVB
doses. To compare the sensitivity to UVB exposure among the cell
lines, we used linear regression analysis to determine the median
lethal dose (LD50) of UVB exposure (Figure S5). The LD50 of UVB
exposure for HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6 expressing HFK cells [19.0+/
27.1 mJ/cm2
, 19.9+/23.8 mJ/cm2
, and 20.6+/23.1 mJ/cm2
),
respectively] were lower than vector control HFK cells [40.7+/
28.8 mJ/cm2
)] (Figure 4A, Figure S5). The increased sensitivity
was not limited to HFKs as similar results were observed in HT1080
cells expressing HPV 5 and 16 E6 (Figure 4B). Interestingly, perhaps
due to the transformed nature of the cells, HT1080 cells not only
repair UVB damage more slowly, but also are more sensitive to
UVB exposure than HFK cells.
NER is responsible not only for repair of UVB induced lesions,
but also the repair of other bulky lesions like the ones induced by
chemotherapeutic crosslinking drugs, such as cisplatin and
mitomycin C [54]. We hypothesized that if E6 expression leads
to the disruption of NER then there will be a general increased
sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. To test this hypothesis, we
measured the viability of HT1080 cells expressing HPV 5, 8, 38,
or 16 E6 in the presence of cisplatin and mitomycin C. Consistent
with our hypothesis, HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6 expressing cells were
also significantly more sensitive to both cisplatin and mitomycin C
than vector control cells (Figure 4 C and D). HPV 38 E6
expressing HT1080 cells were more significantly more sensitive to
cisplatin, but the increased sensitivity did not reach statistical
significance for mitomycin C exposure (Figure 4C and D).
b HPV E6 expression attenuates ATR expression by
promoting p300 degradation
Having shown the increased persistence of thymine dimers and
elevated UVB induced phospho H2AX levels to be dependent on
HPV E6 promoting p300 degradation, we wanted to further
elucidate the mechanism of attenuated UVB damage repair in
HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells. p300 interacts with ATR, a
member of the PI3 kinase family, and is necessary for activation of
ATR in response to hydroxyurea [47]. In addition to facilitating
cell cycle arrest in response to hydroxyurea, ATR also plays a key
role in UVB damage repair [41]. Indeed disruption of this
signaling by RNAi mediated reduction of ATR levels results in
increased sensitivity to UVB exposure much like we have
described in HPV E6 expressing cells [55]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that the increased UVB sensitivity in b-HPV E6

expressing cells is also the result of reduced ATR levels or activity.
To test this hypothesis, we measured ATR protein levels by
immunoblot and found the ATR protein levels were significantly
reduced in HFK cells expressing HPV 5 and 8 E6 with and
without UVB exposure (Figure 5A, B). ATR levels were also
reduced to a lesser degree in HT1080 cells expressing HPV 5 and
8 E6(Figure S6) We also measured ATR mRNA levels by
quantitative RT-PCR in HPV E6 expressing HFK cells and found
significantly lower ATR mRNA levels in HPV 5 (35% reduction),
8 (45% reduction), and 16 E6 (10% reduction) expressing cells
(Figure 5B). Interestingly, ATR levels increased following UVB
exposure, but this increase was the greatest in HPV 5 and 8 E6
expressing cells (Figure 5A and Figure S7).
Cells expressing HPV D8 E6 had thymine dimer persistence and
UVB induced DSBs levels that were similar to vector control cells
(Figure 3). To determine if these cells also had ATR levels that were
similar to vector control cells, we measured ATR protein and mRNA
levels in HPV D8 E6 expressing HFK cells. Consistent with the
hypothesis that reduced ATR levels in HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells
results in more persistent thymine dimers and a greater number of
UVB induced DSBs, ATR protein and mRNA levels in HPV D8 E6
expressing cells are similar to control cells (Figure 5C and 5D).

In response to UVB exposure, ATR forms distinct nuclear foci,
where it co-localizes with and phosphorylates other DNA repair
factors [41], but p300 is required for ATR activation [47]. We
therefore hypothesized that HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression, by
promoting degradation of p300, would interfere with ATR
activation in response to UVB exposure. To test this hypothesis,
we measured the formation of ATR foci by immunofluorescence
following exposure to 10 mJ/cm2 UVB exposure. ATR levels
peaked in both vector control and HPV 38 E6 expressing HT1080
cells within one hour of exposure to UVB (Figure 5E and Figure S7).
In contrast, ATR foci formation does not peak in HPV 5, 8, and 16
E6 expressing cells until 4–6 hours after UVB exposure (Figure 5E
and Figure S8). Despite the temporal differences in ATR activation,
HPV 5, 8 and 16 E6 expressing cells, at peak, had approximately the
same number of ATR positive cells as the vector control cells.
Finally, HPV 16 E6 had a significantly delayed ATR peak compared
to vector control cells, despite having elevated ATR levels.
To more definitively test if the HPV E6 mediated reduction in
p300 resulted in the reduction of ATR expression, we cotrans￾fected either HPV 8 E6 or a vector control with either a wild-type
p300 or a phosphomimetic mutant (p300 S1834E) previously
shown to resist HPV 8 E6 mediated degradation [36]. We then
measured steady state ATR protein levels by immunoblot. ATR
levels were unchanged by the cotransfection of wild type or mutant
p300 with a vector control (Figure 6A and B). As expected, ATR
levels were reduced in HFK cells cotransfected with wild type
p300 and HPV 8 E6. Importantly, ATR levels were similar to
control levels in HFK cells cotransfected with HPV 8 E6 and the
phosphomimetic p300 mutant (Figure 6A and B). Finally, to
provide further support of the hypothesis that HPV 5 and 8 E6
expression reduces ATR levels, we target p300 for siRNA
mediated knocked down and show a corresponding reduction in
ATR levels (Figure 6C and D).
Delayed UVB induced p53 accumulation in b HPV E6
expressing cells
Typically in response to UVB exposure, ATR, a member of the
PI3 kinase family, phosphorylates p53 at ser 15 and 37 [41]. This

phosphorylation blocks the MDM2 mediated ubiquitination of
p53 that in turn leads to its proteasomal degradation. Thus ATR
dependent phosphorylation of p53, in response to UVB exposure
leads to the accumulation of p53 and activation of p53 responsive
genes responsible for DDR [40–43,45,46]. Having seen a
reduction in ATR activation, as well as mRNA and protein levels
in HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells, we hypothesized that UVB￾induced ATR phosphorylation of p53 may also be attenuated in
these cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured levels of
phosphorylated p53 (Serine 15 and 37) in HPV E6 expressing
cells by immunoblot. HPV 5, 8, and 38 E6 expression in HFK and
HT1080 cells was able to significantly reduce phosphorylation of
p53 at both Serine 15 and Serine 37 (Figure 7A, and data not
shown). Because phosphorylation of p53 by ATR results in p53
accumulation, we measured total p53 levels by immunofluores￾cence and found that while the majority of vector control cells
reach peak p53 levels 8 hours following UV exposure, most HPV
5, 8, and 38 E6 expressing cells do not reach peak p53 levels until
12 hours after the same exposure (Figure 7B and Figure S9).
Importantly, p53 accumulation in D8 E6 expressing HFK cells
closely resembles the p53 accumulation measure in control cells
following UVB exposure (Figure S10).

In addition to being phosphorylated in response to UVB exposure,
p53 is also acetylated by p300 at lysine 382 [56]. This acetylation has
been shown to be important for regulation of cell cycle arrest by p53.
Because HPV 5 and 8 E6 promote p300 degradation we
hypothesized that p53 acetylation in response to UVB exposure
would be reduced in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured
p53 acetylation by immunoblot in response to UVB exposure in HPV
5, 8, 38, and 16 E6 expressing HFK cells. As predicted, p53
acetylation levels were greatly attenuated in HPV 5 and 8 E6
expressing cells (Figure 7C). p53 acetylation levels were modestly
reduced in HPV 38 E6 expressing cells and total p53 levels were
greatly reduced in HPV 16 E6 expressing cells.
As a result of p53 accumulation in response to DNA damage,
the cell cycle is halted in order to provide time to repair damage
DNA [57]. HPV depends on host replication machinery to
replicate its genome; therefore it is beneficial for the virus to keep
cells cycling by avoiding such delays. While b-HPV E6 is unable to
target p53 for degradation like HR a-HPV E6, we hypothesized
that by abrogating ATR expression and foci formation, b-HPV E6
expression is able to attenuate UV damage induced G1 arrest [57].
To test this hypothesis, we synchronized HT1080 cells in G1 by
density arrest, exposed them to UVB and then compared their
ability to recover from this arrest to similarly arrested, but not UV
treated cells. As expected, UVB exposure increased the number of

control cells in G1 by approximately 30% compared to untreated
cells. However, there was no significant difference G1 content in
UVB exposed or untreated HPV 5, 8, 38, and 16 E6 expressing
cells (Figure 7D).
We have shown that HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression reduces ATR
expression, in a manner dependent on p300 degradation, and that
following UVB exposure p53 phosphorylation and accumulation
as well as cell cycle arrest are attenuated correlating with an
increased prevalence of UVB induced DSBs. In order to provide
additional evidence that HPV E6 mediated reduction in ATR
expression and activity accounted for the increased sensitivity to
UVB exposure, we measured the ability of PI3 kinase inhibitors to
sensitize cells to UVB exposure. If HPV E6 mediated reduction of
ATR results in sensitivity to UVB exposure, then the ability of
chemical inhibition of ATR activity to further increase this
sensitivity should be less in HPV E6 expressing cells. Currently,
ATR activity can only be chemically inhibited by broad spectrum
inhibitors, like wortmannin and caffeine that target the multiple
PI3 kinase family members, a group of DNA damage responsive
kinases, including ATM, DNA-PK, as well as ATR.
Wortmannin is capable of inhibiting ATM and DNA-PK
activity at lower concentrations and inhibiting ATM, DNA-PK,
and ATR at a concentration of 10 mM [58]. To determine if the
increased sensitivity of HPV E6 expressing cells is associated with
the reduction of ATR activity in these cells, we measured the
ability of a gradient of wortmannin to sensitize HPV 5, 8, 38, and
16 expressing cells to UVB exposure. Importantly, HPV 5, 8, and
38 E6 cells were significantly less sensitive to 10 mM wortmannin
in combination with UVB exposure than vector control cells
(Figure 8A). Similarly, exposure to 2 mM caffeine inhibits both
ATM and ATR activity [59]. To confirm that increased sensitivity
of HPV E6 is associated with diminished ATR activity, we
measured the ability of caffeine to sensitize cells to UVB exposure.
As expected, vector control cells were more sensitive to caffeine
combined with UVB exposure than HPV E6 expressing cells
(Figure 8B).
Since wortmannin is able to inhibit not only ATR but also
ATM, and DNA-PK, and because unlike ATR, chemical
inhibitors specific to ATM and DNA-PK are commercially
available, we used these more specific inhibitors to confirm that
ATR inhibition and not ATM or DNA-PK was responsible for the
changes to UVB sensitivity. First, we showed that ATM inhibition
by Ku 55933 is unable to sensitize cells to UVB exposure
(Figure 8C). We next tested the ability of DNA-PK inhibition by
NU7026 to sensitize cells to UVB exposure. Interestingly, DNA￾PK inhibition significantly increased UVB sensitivity in HPV 38
and 16 E6 expressing cells, however sensitivity was not increased
in either HPV 5 or 8 E6 expressing cells compared with control
cells (Figure 8D).
Discussion
We show that b HPV 5 and 8 E6 decrease at both the mRNA
and protein levels of ATR, a PI3 kinase family member that plays
a key role in the repair of UVB DNA damage (Figure 5).
Additionally, UVB induced ATR foci formation is also delayed in
b HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells (Figure 5E). We confirm an
earlier observation that thymine dimers persist longer in HPV 5
E6 expressing cells and show that this is also true for HPV 8 and
16 E6 expressing cells following UVB exposure (Figure 1A, 1B,
and Figure S2). Importantly, we show that ATR protein levels
remain at control levels in cells expressing HPV D8 E6, a mutant
that has lost the ability to promote p300 degradation. Additionally,
when p300 levels are reduced by targeted siRNA, ATR levels are
also diminished. Conversely, when HPV 8 E6 and a mutated p300
resistant to HPV 8 E6 mediated degradation were cotransfected
ATR levels were not attenuated. Cells expressing HPV D8 E6
have significantly less persistent thymine dimers following UVB
exposure. We see increased UVB induced DSBs in HPV 5, 8, and
16 E6 expressing cells; rarely in HPV 38 E6 expressing cells; but
not in LXSN or HPV D8 E6 expressing cells. UVB induced DSBs
can be caused by the collapse of a replication fork following
collision with a thymine dimer. The increase in UVB induced
DSB in HPV 5, 8, and 16 E6 expressing cells with increased
thymine dimer persistence and decreased UVB induced G1 arrest
(Figure 1 and 7D), is consistent with this explanation of UVB
induced DSB formation. H2AX is phosphorylated in an ATR
dependent fashion following replication stress, so it unlikely that
these elevated H2AX levels result from increased phosphorylation
of H2AX in the absence of an increased number of DSBs [60]. In
addition to disrupting UVB DNA damage repair, we demonstrate
that the HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression sensitizes cells to UVB
exposure. Finally, using wortmannin and caffeine, chemical
inhibitors of PI3 kinase activity, we demonstrate that this
sensitivity is due to the reduced ATR expression in HPV 5 and
8 E6 expressing cells (Figure 8). These data support the hypothesis
that b-HPV infections can contribute to NMSC by acting as a co￾factor that increases the mutagenic potential of UVB exposure.
Our work shows that b-HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression is able to
functionally inhibit UVB DNA damage repair by promoting p300
degradation [36] resulting in decreased ATR activity. As expected
by the central role of ATR in UVB induced DNA damage repair,
cells expressing b-HPV E6s that reduce ATR levels are more
sensitive to UVB exposure. We can mimic this increased UVB
sensitivity in control cells by the Inhibition of ATR activity by
wortmannin. Although wortmannin treatment increases UVB
sensitivity in HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells, the increase in
UVB sensitivity is half that seen in control cells (Figure 8). This
observation allows us to estimate that HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression
reduces the ability of ATR to protect cells against UVB induced
damage by approximately 50%.
Attenuated phosphorylation and delayed accumulation of p53
offers further evidence that the HPV E6 mediated reduction of
ATR levels and delay in ATR foci formation is physiologically
relevant (Figure 5, 7A and 7B). p53 plays a central role in DNA
Damage Repair (DDR). In response to UVB induced DNA
damage, phosphorylation of p53 blocks its MDM2 mediated
degradation allowing p53 to accumulate in the nucleus and
activate expression of genes involved in DDR. While b-HPV E6
expression is not able to target p53 for proteasomal degradation
like HR a- HPV E6, b-HPV E6 expression still hinders p53
activity. As a result of reduced ATR and p300 levels, p53
phosphorylation and acetylation is diminished in response to UVB
induced DNA damage. Indeed, HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression results
in the attenuation of p53 accumulation. This provides an
explanation for the observation that the repair of thymine dimers
is delayed with b-HPV E6 expression. Together these data show
that p300 plays an important role in modifying p53 in response
to UV damage, not only directly, but also indirectly through
ATR.
In addition to its role in DDR, in order to allow time for repair
before entrance into the cell cycle, p53 signaling can induce cell
cycle arrest. In response to UVB exposure, cells arrest in the G1
phase of the cell cycle. b-HPVs do not encode their own
replication machinery and therefore require cycling cells in order
to proliferate. We show that HPV 5, 8, 38, and 16 E6 expression
allows cells to continue through the cell cycle after UVB exposure
in much the same way as unexposed cells (Figure 6D).
HPV 5 and 8 E6 Abrogate ATR Activity
PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 July 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e1002807

Importantly, we show that although reduced UVB induced cell
cycle arrest is likely advantageous for b-HPVs, in combination
with delayed thymine dimer repair it can be very deleterious for
cells. Since b-HPV E6 expressing cells are less likely to experience
growth arrest and more likely to contain unrepaired thymine
dimers, they are also more likely to have replication forks collide
with a thymine dimer resulting in a DSB. Indeed, HPV 5 and 8 E6
expressing cells are nearly 4 times as likely to experience a DSB
8 hours after UV exposure as control cells (Figure 1). The
transformation of a thymine dimer into a DSB represents a serious
escalation of the damage sustained by the chromosome. Since the
repair of a DSB can result in mutations or recombinations, the
reduction of ATR activity by b-HPV E6 expression can
dramatically alter the persistence as well as the magnitude of
damage sustain by UV exposure.
p300 interacts, either directly or indirectly, with ATR and this
interaction is necessary for hydroxyurea-induced cell cycle arrest [47].
Indeed, in the absence of catalytically active p300, ATR fails to
properly phosphorylate Chk1 [47], one of its downstream targets [61].
Here we show that in cells that have reduced p300 levels due to HPV 5
and 8 E6 expression [36], ATR activation is significantly delayed in
response to UVB exposure (Figure 5E). Additionally, we show that
ATR mRNA and protein levels are reduced in these cells (Figure 5A
and 5B), but not in cells expressing HPV D8 E6 (Figure 5C and 5D),
suggesting that p300 plays a role in regulating ATR expression.
Interestingly, cells expressing HPV 16 E6 also have a delayed ATR
response (Figure 5E). However, HPV 16 E6 expressing cells do not
have reduced ATR levels (Figure 5A, 5B) and have been shown to
bind p300, but not to promote its degradation [36]. We speculate that
the delayed ATR response in these cells may be related to
the binding of p300 by HPV 16 E6 potentially disrupting
the interaction between p300 and ATR necessary for ATR activation.
Interestingly, a reduction in ATR levels as well as diminished
ability to repair UVB induced DNA damage (increased thymine
dimer persistence, increased DSBs, delayed ATR activation and
attenuated p53 accumulation) occurred in HT1080 cells express￾ing HPV 5 and 8 E6. AKT is constitutively activated in HT1080
cells and this impedes the ability of HPV 5 and 8 E6 to degrade
p300 by pushing the equilibrium of AKT/p300/E6 binding
toward the stabilizing interaction between AKT and p300. We
propose that despite this shift in equilibrium, HPV 5 and 8 E6
would maintain their ability to bind p300, and disrupt some of its
downstream interactions, specifically those necessary for ATR
activation and expression.

HPV 5 and 8 E6 Abrogate ATR Activity
PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 July 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e1002807

The response to UVB exposure in cells expressing HPV 38 E6 is
particularly intriguing. HPV 38 E6 expressing cells share several
characteristics with HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells. They fail to
G1 arrest in response to UVB exposure and have diminished p53
acetylation and phosphorylation. However, thymine dimer repair
persistence and UVB induced DSB formation in HPV 38 E6
expressing cells are more similar to vector control cells. Perhaps
these observations are best explained by the ability of HPV 38 E6
to bind p300 in a similar location as by HPV 5 and 8 E6, but with
a much lower affinity. We speculate that this weaker interaction
gives rise to the phenotypes
While it has been shown by our lab and others that b-HPV E6
expression is capable of promoting Bak degradation following
UVB exposure (thus inhibiting apoptosis 24 hours after UV
exposure), here we report that expression of the same b-HPV E6s
results in decreased proliferation during a three day window
following UVB exposure [31,62]. We speculate that this apparent
contradiction can be most readily explained by the temporal
differences in the two assays. We describe significantly delayed
repair in b-HPV E6 expressing cells and theorize that this may
delay apoptosis past the previously observed window. Alternative￾ly, where the previous work looked exclusively at apoptosis, the
viability assay described here looks more generally at recovery and
growth following UVB exposure. The diminished viability
observed using this more inclusive measurement of cellular health
may indicate an increase in cellular senescence, delay/reduction in
proliferation or an increase in non-apoptotic death.
We speculate that Bak degradation provides an immediate
benefit to the virus following UV exposure. b HPV E6 expression
drives cells through cell cycle despite the presence of thymine
dimers. While this potentially provides the virus access to the
cellular transcription machinery, it also increases the likelihood that
UV exposure results in a DSB. The ability of b HPV E6 expression
to promote Bak degradation at this time may be necessary to allow
cells to avoid apoptosis in response to increased levels of DSBs.
If b-HPV infections play a role in NMSC, then they must do so
transiently, as testing has rarely been able to show consistent HPV
expression in these tumors. The hypothesis most consistent with
this evidence is that a b-HPV infection acts in a way that initiates
tumor development, but that is not necessary for tumor
maintenance. Our data are consistent with a model of b-HPV
linked skin cancer, where a b-HPV infection confers resistance to
UV induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Following UV
exposure, this resistance then allows more cells to pass through
the cell cycle with unrepaired thymine dimers and thereby
increasing the prevalence of DSBs. While this would result in
reduced cellular viability, the surviving population of cells would
be at risk for increased mutations, particularly those that allow
cells to tolerate genomic instability and thus increase their
carcinogenic potential. Interestingly, several studies have found
p53 mutations to be prevalent in skin malignancies from patients
with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), a rare genetic disorder
associated with increased susceptibility to HPV 5 and 8 infections
[7,63,64]. Finally, in support of a model where HPV 5 and 8
infections promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting UV damage repair,
a high frequency (50–75%) of these mutations are CRT
transitions, typically result of UV damaged DNA [63,64].
Materials and Methods
UVB irradiation
Cells were seeded and grown overnight. The following morning,
cells were washed once with PBS and then irradiated through a
thin film of PBS with the amount of UVB irradiation indicated in
the figure. Fresh media was then added to the cells. The UVB
source is a parallel bank of two FS20t12/UVB bulbs (Solarc
Systems, Inc., Barrie, ON, Canada) with an output range of 280 to
320 nm. The UVB output is measured with an IL1400A
radiometer coupled with the SEL240/UVB-1/TD UVB detector
(International Light, Peabody, MA).
Cellular viability assay
10,000 cells per well were seeded in a 24 well plate. 12 hours
later, the cells were either exposure to UVB or switched to media
containing either cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or
mitomycin C (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). After three days,
cells were stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet in 5% (v/v) acetic
acid and 2.5% (v/v) isopropanol for one hour. The plates were
then washed with water and dried. Crystal violet stain was then
eluted from the cells by one wash in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and the
amount of stain was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 590
nanometers using KC Junior software and a mQuant spectropho￾tometer (Bio-tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) as a measure of the
number of cells. The linear range for crystal violet absorption and
its ability to accurately quantitate cells was verified (Figure S11).
DNA constructs
All HPV E6 constructs were cloned into the pLXSN vector after
being generated by PCR amplification from full length HPV
DNA. The construction of these vectors has been previously
described [31]. p300wt and p300S1834E vectors have been
previously described [36].
RT-PCR
RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Briefly, 1 ml of Trizol was added to each 10-cm plate, cells
were incubated for 5 minutes, and 200 mL of chloroform was
added. The aqueous phase was transferred and mixed with an
equal volume of isopropanol, incubated for 10 minutes, and
pelleted at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4uC. After being washed
with 75% ethanol, the samples were again pelleted at 9,000 rpm
for 5 minutes and resuspended in in RNase free water. 1 mg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA, using the
iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA). As a negative
control, parallel samples were run without reverse transcriptase.
Non-quantitative PCR amplification was then performed to
identify 100 bp amplicons with E6 and 36B4 primers as previously
described [31]. For real-time RT-PCR, RNA was isolated and
reverse transcribed as above and quantitative real-time PCR was
performed using an ABI 9700 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification was carried out using
TaqMan primer/probes: GAPDH (4333764F) and ATR
(Hs00354807) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Ap￾plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Reactions were performed in
triplicate in a 25 mL volume, with the following cycle parameters:
enzyme activation (10 minutes at 95uC), followed by 40 cycles
(each cycle consisting of 15 seconds at 95uC and 1 min at 60uC).
Data analysis was performed using the comparative threshold
cycle method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine
expression levels.
Immunofluorescent microscopy
8,000 HFKs or HT1080 cells (vector control, HPV 5 E6, 8 E6,
38 E6 and 16 E6) were seeded onto Greiner glass bottomed 96well
dishes. The next day, at the appropriate time following UV
exposure, cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde
at 4C while spinning at 200RPM in tabletop centrifuge and

permeabilized with ice cold Methanol/Acetone (1:1) for 5 min at
4C. Cells were washed carefully with PBS 3X then blocked with
PBS/10% Goat serum for 30 min at 37C, Washed 26 PBS and
then incubated with primary antibody to phospho-H2AX (ser139)
(Upstate-Millipore, Billerica, MA), p53 (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA), or thymine dimmers(Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). The cells
were then washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 anti mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) 1:1000+ Hoechst 33342 DNA dye 1:10,000 for 1 hour) before
being visualized using the Cellomics Array Scan microscope
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Automated image analysis
Images of the cells stained with the indicated antibodies were
acquired with a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) using a 2060.40 NA objective. Image
analysis was performed using Cellomics ArrayScan HCS Reader
(Thermo Scienctific), with the XF53 filter set using the compart￾ment analysis profiling module v3.5. Nuclear staining was used to
delineate the cells. After background correction, either the nuclear
fluorescence intensity (Compartmental Analysis Bioapplication) or
the quantity of nuclear foci (Spot Detector Bioapplication) was
assessed. Approximately 400 cells were analyzed in each well for
all reactions. Each time point and cell line was repeated in
triplicate on the plate and in triplicate experimentally.
Immunoblotting
Whole cell extracts were prepared by mechanically detaching
cells in cold PBS and resuspending in WE16th lysis buffer (50 nM
Tris-HCL at pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40,
0.1% sodium dodecul sulfate, 20% glycerol, 80 mM b-glycero￾phosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovana￾date, and a COMPLETE protease inhibitor tablet (Roche,
Alameda, CA). Lysates were then sonicated and clarified by
centrifugation. The DC protein assay (Biorad, Hercules, CA) was
used to determine protein concentrations. Equal amounts of
protein lysates (15–30 mg) were electrophoresed on SDS-poly￾acrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). These membranes were then exposed to
primary antibodies against p53 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA),
ATR (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), phospho p53 (ser15 or ser37)
(Cell Signaling), nucleolin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), acetyl-p53 (lys382) (cell signaling), or actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). After exposure to the corresponding HRP￾conjugated secondary antibody, cells were visualized using lumilite
HRP substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Tissue culture
HT1080 cells are a spontaneously immortalized fibrosarcoma
that contain a constitutively activate N-Ras gene. Primary human
foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) were derived from neonatal human
foreskins and grown in EpiLife medium supplemented with
calcium chloride (60 mM), human keratinocyte growth supplement
(Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) and penicillin-streptomycin.
Multiple derivations of HFK cells from neonatal human foreskins
were utilized in this work. Following viral transduction, and
selection, HPV E6 expression was confirmed using rtPCR to
measure HPV E6 levels as well as by immunoblot to confirm HPV
5 and 8 E6 expressing cells had previously characterized reduction
in p300 [36] and that HPV 16 E6 expressing cells had previously
described reduction in p53 [20]. HT1080 and 293T cells were
grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS).
Briefly HPV E6 genes cloned into a LXSN vector were co￾transfected with VSV-G helper plasmids into 293T cells using
Fugene 6 (Roche), and retrovirus was collected at 12, 24, 36, and
48 hours post transfection. Transiently produced virus was
concentrated by ultracentrifugation and used to infect HFK and
HT1080 monolayers (50–60% confluent) in the presence of
Polybrene (8 mg/mL). Four hours after infection, cells were
washed with PBS and the media replaced. The cells were
expanded when confluent and placed under neomycin-G418
selection (50 mg/L) for 7 days. All transient transfections were
done using TransIT Keratinocyte transfection reagent (Mirus),
and assessed 72 hours later for levels of ATR. siRNA specific for
p300 and controls were purchased from Dharmacon RNA
Technologies. siRNA transfections were done using RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, and were
assessed for p300 and ATR levels 72 hours after transfection.
Nuclei isolation and propidium iodide staining
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and then pelleted by
centrifugation at 4uC. The resulting pellets were then resuspended
in PBS/2% fetal bovine serum before being pelleted again by
centrifugation at 4uC. While vortexing, the pellets were resus￾pended in 3 mL of cold 95% ethanol. Once thoroughly
resuspended, the cells were covered in foil and kept at 4uC
overnight. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4uC and
the supernatant was aspirated. To strip the cytoplasm from the
cells, the resulting pellets were resuspended with continual
vortexing in 0.08% pepsin and incubated at 37uC for 20 minutes.
The resulting nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4uC
and the supernatant was removed. The pelleted nuclei were then
resuspended with continuous vortexing in 2 mL IFA (150 mM
NaCl, 4% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide)+5% Tween 20.
Nuclei were again pelleted by centrifugation at 4uC and the
supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in
250 mL+5 mg/ml RNase A and transferred to 12675 mm snap
cap tubes with filter caps. Following 30 minute incubation at 37uC
for 30 minutes 250 mL fo 100 mg/ml propridium iodide (in PBS)
was added to each tube. Samples were stored overnight at 4uC
before being analyzed for DNA content using BD Bio Canto
instrument and FlowJo software.
Density arrest
Cells were seeded at 50–60% confluence and allowed to grow
until they reached 95–100% confluence. Old media was carefully
removed and replaced with new media every 24 hours. One day
after the cells reached optimal confluence, they were either
exposed to 10 mJ/cm2 UVB or left untreated as a control, seeded
and either allowed to grow for 24 hours to access G1 arrest or
harvested immediately to access density arrest.
PI3 kinase inhibition
All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and used at indicated
concentration. Caffeine, Wortmannin, and Nu7026 were pur￾chased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Ku55933 was
purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA)
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise noted, statistical significance was determined
by paired student T test and confirmed when appropriate by two
way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Only p values less than
or equal to 0.05 were reported as significant. Additionally,
Microsoft excel was used to provide the curve fitting in Figures 1,
