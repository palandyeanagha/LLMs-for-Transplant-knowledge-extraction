Impella-Supported Cardiac Surgery
Abstract:
Background: Impella left ventricular assist devices are useful tools for the treatment of 
cardiogenic shock. The peri-operative use of Impella in patients with low left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) undergoing cardiac surgery, can be valuable for cardiac surgeons to 
prevent postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock.
Methods: From September 2018 to June 2019, 10 patients underwent cardiac surgery 
supported by Impella 5.0. Five patients underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB), 
two had OPCAB and mitral valve repair (MVR), and one each had aortic valve repair (AVR) plus 
MVR, OPCAB plus AVR, and left ventricular aneurysmectomy plus MV replacement. The Impella 
5.0 was inserted surgically one day before the operative procedure via a side conduit through 
the left femoral artery in 8 cases and right axillary artery in 2 cases. The mean age of patients 
was 63 ± 7 years. Mean LVEF at baseline was 27.5% (20-32%) and mean duration of Impella 
support was 7 days (4-12 days).
Results: Hemodynamics improved immediately after the initiation of mechanical support. The 
cardiac surgical procedures were conducted in the usual manner. All patients received low 
dose of postoperative inotropes. Cardiac-related mortality was 10% (1/10), due to multiorgan 
failure (MOF) in 1 patient who underwent OPCAB. Major intracranial bleeding occurred in 2 
patients who received extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Impella support was weaned in all 
patients after hemodynamics was optimized without inotropes, except the patient with MOF. 
The survivors had no major complications and were discharged to medical therapy at mean 
of 21 days.
Conclusion: Impella support is feasible for preconditioning before surgery and in the 
postoperative period. It enables cardiac surgery in patients with low EF using a low dose of 
inotropes and helps to prevent postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. Impella support during 
OPCAB allows for easier positioning and unloading the heart. The underlying cause for 
intracranial bleeding in two cases despite successful weaning from Impella support remains 
to be understood.

Introduction
Studies report that 0.2-9% of the patients undergoing cardiac surgery, irrespective of the type 
of surgery, experience postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS), thereby contributing to the 
high overall mortality [1,2]. Mortality with PCCS is higher than cardiogenic shock (CS) due to 
other etiologies and is the most common indication for receiving a short term mechanical 
circulatory support (MCS), albeit with the lowest survival to discharge [3]. PCCS was also found 
to be an independent predictor of mortality in CS.

Patient- or procedure-related causes are potential risk factors 
with low preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
being the top independent predictor of CS [2]. Until recently, 
IABP was the most used mechanical support device. However, 
its use has declined since the publication of the results of the 
IABP-Shock II randomized trial showing limited effects in CS 
[4-6]. The ESC guidelines for myocardial revascularization 
indicate the routine use of IABP in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) with CS [7] is not useful or effective and in some cases 
may be harmful. 
Left-sided Impella heart pumps include Impella 5.0®, which 
is a trans-aortic, micro axial, non-pulsatile mechanical pump 
that provides flows up to 5.0 L/min. Impella 5.0 provides 
temporary, partial, or full mechanical circulatory support and 
has been reported to be feasible and safe in bridging PCCS 
patients to recovery, durable VAD or transplantation [8].
In contrast to IABP, which decreases LV afterload and increases 
stroke volume, Impella devices aspire blood from the LV and 
deliver it directly into the aorta above the aortic valve, thus 
unloading the LV and consequently reducing myocardial 
oxygen consumption and increasing coronary blood flow. 
In other words, Impella pumps decrease LV pressures and 
volumes, thereby reducing the cardiac workload.
The approved indications for Impella 5.0 support include 
patients with cardiogenic shock, low cardiac output 
syndrome during or after cardiac interventions, or as a bridge 
to transplant or ventricular assist device.
One of the important considerations for MCS therapy in PCCS 
is the timing of initiation. While early initiation of support is 
associated with improved in-hospital and 1-year outcomes, 
late support is often associated with high mortality (9). 
Delays in the initiation of MCS may be due to the need for 
qualified staff available on-demand and the concerns related 
to potential complications such as bleeding [10].
We report the use of Impella 5.0 peri-operatively as a planned 
support for high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
to unload the heart before the procedure, overcome shock 
related to surgical injury, and aid beating heart myocardial 
revascularization by reducing the occurrence of myocardial 
ischemia related to the heart positioning.
Materials and Methods
Study design
A retrospective review of 10 patients with low LVEF (<30%, 
mean 27.5%) and high Euroscore II (mean 17.4%) who 
underwent elective cardiac surgery from September 2018 to 
September 2019 was performed. The baseline characteristics 
of patients are reported in Table 1.

The Impella 5.0 was implanted one day before the surgical 
procedure in the cat lab under fluoroscopy via the femoral 
(n=8) or axillary artery (n=2), using a side surgical 10 mm 
vascular graft. At the same time, a full dose of Levosimendan 
was slowly administered to all patients. No other inotropes 
were administered before surgery.
Maximal Impella support was started immediately after 
implantation to unload the heart and improve cardiac 
output and maintained until the initiation of extracorporeal 
circulation (ECC). Impella support was reduced to P2 during 
ECC and aortic valve replacement while full support was 
maintained during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery 
(OPCAB). Impella support was continued in the postoperative 
phase for at least 72 hours until hemodynamic stability was 
achieved. Activated clotting time was maintained around 
160 seconds. Whenever possible, patients were extubated 
and mobilized as tolerated, particularly in cases with axillary 
Impella implants. The postoperative infusion of inotropic 
drugs was kept as low as possible (<0.1 µg/ml/min), and the 
heart contractility was monitored daily with transthoracic 
(TT) or transesophageal (TE) echocardiography.
Following hemodynamic stabilization, Impella flow was slowly 
reduced to assess if weaning could be initiated. The criteria

for weaning were cardiac index (>2 L/min), lactate levels (<3 
mmol/L), and adequate mixed venous saturation. Weaning 
was started in a stepwise fashion by reducing the pump flow 
by two speeds daily until P2, along with monitoring by TTE. 
Once the assessment results were acceptable, Impella was 
removed at the bedside by retracting the pump into the 
vascular graft (which was clipped and stapled at the base).
Procedure
Five patients had off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery 
(OPCAB), and 5 had other surgical procedures using 
extracorporeal circulation (ECC) (Table 2). In patients 
undergoing concomitant surgeries, OPCAB was performed 
first. Myocardial viability was preoperatively documented by 
stress echocardiography.

The mean number of grafts to achieve complete 
revascularization in OPCAB patients was 3.1. In all cases, 
the left mammary artery and left radial artery were used 
to revascularize the left coronary system in “Y” or “double 
Y” shaped fashion. The saphenous vein was used to graft 
the right coronary system in four patients. Three patients 
undergoing concomitant surgeries received a mean of 2.3 
grafts, with arterial conduits to the left coronary system. Also, 
two mitral valve repairs plus one replacement, two aortic 
valve replacements and one left ventricular aneurysmectomy 
were performed. The mean ECC and cross-clamp time was 
82 and 67 mins, respectively. The mean preoperative cardiac 
index was 1.9 l/min.
Results
The cardiac-related 30 days mortality was 10% (1/10). Impella 
could not be weaned in one patient who developed severe 
multiorgan failure (MOF) and died on the 5th postoperative 
day (POD). A major cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 2 
patients having ECC on 2nd and 5th POD. Impella support 
was successfully weaned in these patients on day 4th and 
6th following satisfactory cardiac function. Of note, one of 
the patients had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage two years 
before as well. Among the survivors, acute renal insufficiency 
developed in 2 patients receiving veno-venous ultrafiltration 
and resolved after 8-10 days. In one case Impella malfunction 
resulted in urgent removal during the weaning process. 
Late sepsis that resolved with appropriate antibiotic therapy 
occurred in one patient. No device-related heart injury, 
significant hemolysis, embolic stroke, or reoperation for 
bleeding occurred. The mean postoperative cardiac index 
was 2.55 l/min. 
Adrenaline dose > 1 µg/kg/min for a short duration (mean 
11 hours) was needed in two patients. The mean duration 
of Impella support was 7 days (4-12). Among the survivors, 
follow‐up echocardiography at 3 months showed an 
improved LVEF (34% mean) with no signs of heart failure. 
Results are summarized in Table 3.

Discussion
The indications for MCS use have changed drastically in 
recent years. The “LV unloading” concept with the Impella

micro-axial flow pumps have gained popularity, given their 
ability to reduce LV wall stress and the resulting decrease 
in myocardial oxygen consumption. The Impella heart 
pumps are easy to implant and explant, associated with 
a low incidence of complications, allow for early patient 
mobilization with axillary implantation, and have only few 
contraindications. The ease of management among nursing 
staff is an added value, particularly in high volume centers. 
On the opposite its use can be affected by complications like 
limb ischemia, vascular injury, stroke and bleeding requiring 
blood transfusion. Hemolysis due to mechanical erythrocyte 
shearing stress has been reported, sometimes associated 
with acute kidney injury.
Experimental animal studies report that LV unloading reduces 
ischemia-reperfusion injury and infarct size expansion in AMI. 
This effect is related to both the degree and early initiation 
of LV unloading [11-14]. Lazkani et al. reported an improved 
one-year outcome in “all-comers” receiving early support with 
Impella compared with its use as a bailout [9]. 
Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was the extensively used 
MCS for cardiogenic shock, before the introduction of Impella 
heart pumps. IABP reduces left ventricular (LV) afterload 
and improves coronary flow, but its effects are modest 
compared to Impella devices. Alushi et al. recently reported 
improvement in parameters of shock severity and LVEF at 30 
days with Impella use in AMI-CS patients compared to IABP, 
although no difference in mortality was observed [15]. Given 
the substantial evidence of the ineffectiveness of IABP, it is not 
used as MCS for PCCS at our hospital.
During “on-pump” surgery, cardiac ischemia typically 
occurs during cross-clamping despite optimal cardioplegic 
protection. While in OPCAB, temporary myocardial ischemia 
can be due to heart displacement, temporary interruption 
of coronary blood flow or blood loss. Patients with low 
ventricular EF may have additional complications resulting 
in failure to wean from ECC or development of PCCS that 
could be fatal. Based on these considerations, we developed 
the concept of using Impella as prophylactic therapy in 
high-risk cardiac surgery to prevent PCCS. This strategy may 
enable to perform surgery in patients suffering from severe 
LV dysfunction, usually turned down by the surgeons despite 
having a long-life expectancy.
Until 2018, only 5 case studies of Impella-supported high￾risk cardiac surgery were reported [16-19]. Recently, three 
new reports were published, leading to a total of 18 cases, 
all demonstrating the successful adoption of this concept 
[20-22]. Ranganath et al. reported the largest series of 
prophylactic Impella use in 13 patients with low LVEF 
undergoing on-pump CABG [20]. They used Impella LD that 
was inserted in ascending aorta via a side graft and required 
surgical removal after weaning. No mortality and low rate 
of major complications (hemolysis, displacement, and 
renal insufficiency) were reported so they concluded that 
prophylactic use of the Impella is safe and effective in patients 
with severe LV dysfunction. 
In our study, a low rate of major complications was observed 
with Impella use during high-risk surgery in line with the 
results of Ranganath et al. [20], except for the occurrence of 
cerebral hemorrhage cases that remains unexplained. We 
avoid the Impella LD use because of the surgical removal risks.
In our experience, implantation of a left-sided Impella is easy 
and involves a short learning curve. Initially, we placed the 
Impella via the femoral artery mainly due to our comfort and 
experience level with the procedure. Recently (since the last 
two cases herein reported) we transitioned to positioning 
the Impella via the axillary artery. When the Impella device 
is implanted before surgery, support can be initiated 
immediately after the operation without the need for a 
hybrid operative room or transfer of the patient to the cath 
lab. The axillary implantation of Impella allows early patient 
mobilization and has a low rate of pump displacement, which 
is beneficial, particularly when prolonged support is needed. 
Previously, we used the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP and found 
that higher cardiac output was required in PCCS requiring 
escalation, so Impella 5.0 was used for all cases in this study. 
No pump displacement, major renal dysfunction, or hemolysis 
was observed in this study. Also, the overall complication rate 
and device malfunction were low, which is typically higher in 
this subset of patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery.
The in-hospital major morbidity was mainly due to cerebral 
hemorrhages, which were likely not related to the use of 
Impella. All but one patient were weaned off Impella with low 
myocardial stress.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that planned prophylactic use of 
Impella, rather than bail out strategy after the occurrence 
of PCCS, is safe and effective when utilized as a bridge-to￾recovery and enables high-risk cardiac surgery in patients 
with low LVEF while using a low dose of inotropes. LV

unloading with Impella decreases wall tension and improves 
coronary perfusion favoring myocardial recovery, thereby 
preventing PCCS. Impella support during OPCAB allows 
for easier positioning and unloading of the heart, enabling 
complete revascularization. The favorable results of this study 
are encouraging. However, the occurrence of intracranial 
bleeding in 2 cases despite successful weaning remains to be 
explained. 
Considering the observational nature of this study, the results 
should be considered hypothesis-generating and additional 
studies are required to evaluate the prophylactic use of 
Impella support in patients undergoing high-risk cardiac 
surgery.
