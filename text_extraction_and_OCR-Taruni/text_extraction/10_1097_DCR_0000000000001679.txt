Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) using a combination of database-specific subject headings and keywords for 
diverticulitis, diverticulosis, medical management, antibiotics, probiotics, rifaximin, mesalamine, emergency surgery, elective surgery, 
and laparoscopic lavage. Exact search strategies are included above. Results were limited from January 1, 2013 to October 25, 2019.
