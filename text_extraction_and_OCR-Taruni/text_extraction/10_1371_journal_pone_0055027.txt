Abstract
The role of podocytes in the development and progression of glomerular disease has been extensively investigated in the
past decade. However, the importance of glomerular endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of proteinuria and
glomerulosclerosis has been largely ignored. Recent studies have demonstrated that endothelial nitric oxide synthatase
(eNOS) deficiency exacerbates renal injury in anti-GBM and remnant kidney models and accelerates diabetic kidney damage.
Increasing evidence also demonstrates the importance of the glomerular endothelium in preventing proteinuria. We
hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction can initiate and promote the development and progression of glomerulopathy.
Administration of adriamycin (ADR) to C57BL/6 mice, normally an ADR resistant strain, with an eNOS deficiency induced
overt proteinuria, severe glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and inflammation. We also examined glomerular endothelial
cell and podocyte injury in ADR-induced nephropathy in Balb/c mice, an ADR susceptible strain, by immunostaining, TUNEL
and Western blotting. Interestingly, down-regulation of eNOS and the appearance of apoptotic glomerular endothelial cells
occurred as early as 24 hours after ADR injection, whilst synaptopodin, a functional podocyte marker, was reduced 7 days
after ADR injection and coincided with a significant increase in the number of apoptotic podocytes. Furthermore,
conditioned media from mouse microvascular endothelial cells over-expressing GFP-eNOS protected podocytes from TNF￾a-induced loss of synaptopodin. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction and damage precedes
podocyte injury in ADR-induced nephropathy. Glomerular endothelial cells may protect podocytes from inflammatory
insult. Understanding the role of glomerular endothelial dysfunction in the development of kidney disease will facilitate in
the design of novel strategies to treat kidney disease.

Introduction
Diabetic and non-diabetic glomerular diseases remain the major
cause of chronic and end-stage renal disease [1]. Proteinuria is an
indicator of kidney disease and is largely caused by glomerular
disease, such as diabetes or glomerulonephritis [2]. Numerous
studies have focused on the roles of podocytes, the glomerular
basement membrane (GBM) and mesangial cells in the pathogen￾esis of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis [3–5]. The importance
of glomerular endothelial cells in glomerular injury has been
largely ignored. Recent studies have demonstrated that endothelial
nitric oxide synthatase (eNOS) deficiency exacerbates renal injury
in anti-GBM [6] and remnant kidney models [7] and accelerates
diabetic kidney damage with features that resemble human
diabetic nephropathy (DN) [8–11]. In patients, eNOS polymor￾phisms that lead to decreased eNOS expression and activity have
been associated with advanced DN and progressive IgA nephrop￾athy [12–14]. Scavengers of endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-
production, such as asymmetric dimethyl-arginine or N-Nitro-L￾Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) can acutely increase glomerular
permeability and induce proteinuria [15–17]. Collectively, these
studies suggest that endothelial dysfunction is involved in the
development of diabetic and non-diabetic glomerular injury and
renal fibrosis [18,19].
One of the most important mediators released by the
endothelium is NO. NO acts as a potent vasodilator, and also
inhibits inflammation, growth of vascular smooth muscle and
aggregation of platelets [20–23]. Dysregulation of NO has been
described in patients with DN, including increased NO expression
in early DN, followed by marked down-regulation. Henke et al.
[24] generated mice in which the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)
suppressor IkBaD was induced in the endothelium using Cre/Lox
technology. When these mice were exposed to Angiotensin II
infusion, high salt and inhibition of endogenous NO production,
hypertension was not prevented. However, NF-kB suppression
markedly reduced renal injury as evidenced by decreased
proteinuria, renal inflammation and fibrosis [24]. This study
demonstrated a previously unappreciated role of the endothelium
in glomerular injury [25].
It is believed that the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB),
including the podocyte layer, the glomerular basement membrane
(GBM), and the endothelium, plays an essential role in regulating
glomerular permeability. Recent studies have demonstrated the
importance of the glomerular endothelium and its surface layer in

preventing proteinuria [26]. Increasing evidence also demonstrates
that glomerular endothelial cell fenestrae are integral components
of the glomerular filtration barrier [27–31]. Reduction in
glomerular endothelial cell fenestration and an increase in
podocyte detachment are correlated with the severity of classical
DN lesions and renal function in type 1 diabetic patients [32].
Taken together, these studies from both structural and functional
viewpoints demonstrate that glomerular endothelial dysfunction
plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease,
suggesting that endothelial function is also a key determinant of
susceptibility to nephropathy.
In the present study we hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction
can initiate and propel the development and progression of
glomerulopathy. We tested whether eNOS deficiency promotes
endothelial injury and drives the development of adriamycin
(ADR)-induced nephropathy in C57BL/6 mice, an ADR-resistant
strain. We also examined and compared podocyte and glomerular
endothelial cell injury in ADR-induced nephropathy in Balb/c
mice, an ADR-susceptible strain. Finally we investigated whether
the conditioned medium from mouse microvascular endothelial
cells over expressing eNOS can protect podocytes from TNF-a￾induced injury in vitro.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Animals
Wild-type C57BL6/J and Balb/c mice (8 weeks old) were
purchased from Monash Animal Services, Monash University,
Australia. Breeding pairs of eNOS knockout mice were purchased
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained at
Monash Animal Services. All experiments were performed with
the approval of a Monash University Animal Ethics Committee,
which adheres to the ‘‘Australian Code of Practice for the Care
and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.’’ Five C57BL/6 male
mice and six Balb/c male mice per group were used in each
experiment.
To establish the animal model of adriamycin (ADR)-induced
nephropathy, wild type, eNOS knockout and Balb/c mice received
a single intravenous injection of ADR (10.5 mg/kg; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). Control mice were treated with an equivalent
intravenous volume of normal saline (NS) vehicle. Mice were killed
at 24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after ADR or
NS injection. Cardiac blood, urine and kidney tissue were
collected for analysis. Six mice per group were used in these
studies.
Blood Pressure Measurements
Systolic blood pressure (BP) was measured using a tail-cuff
sphygmomanometer (Visitech BP2000; Visitech Systems, Apex,
NC). Animals were trained and accustomed to the machine, and
all measurements were performed at the same time of day.
Measurements of creatinine and protein in blood and
urine
Mice were housed in metabolic cages, with free access to chow
and water on the days of urine collection. Protein from 24 hour
urine samples and serum creatinine levels were measured using a
DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Gladesville, New South Wales,
Australia) and Creatinine Assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Abor,
MI), according to instructions supplied.
Cell Culture
Mouse podocyte cell culture. Podocytes between passage
10 and 15 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplement

penicillin solution [33]. Cells were propagated in 10 U/ml murine
IFNc at 33uC and then differentiated by culture for 7 days at 37uC
in the absence of IFNc [34]. Differentiated podocytes showed
prominent cytoplasmic processes and expressed synaptopodin.

Mouse microvascular endothelial cell (MMEC) culture
and generation of eNOS over-expression MMECs. MMECs
were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA ) and cultured in 5%
CO2 atmosphere at 37uC in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Life Technologies BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% FBS.
To generate eNOS over-expression in MMECs, MMECs were
transfected with pcDNA3-eNOS-GFP plasmid (Addgene Plasmid
22444) using FuGENE HD (Roche, Hawthorn, Austrialia). Seven
days after transfection, two rounds of fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) (FACsDiva, Flowcore, Clayton, Australia) were
employed to obtain eNOS-GFP-positive and eNOS-GFP-negative
MMECs.
MMEC conditioned mediae. NOS-GFP-positive and
eNOS-GFP-negative MMECs were separately seeded into 6
well-tissue culture plates at a density of 36106 cells/well. The
cells were incubated for 12 hours then washed three times with
PBS prior to fresh media being added to the cells. The supernatant
was collected 24 hours later and is referred to as eNOS-GFP￾positive and eNOS-GFP-negative media, respectively.
TNF-a treated podocyte cell culture. Podocytes were
seeded in 6 well-plates at a density of 16106 cells per well and
cultured initially at 33uC (propagating condition) prior being
cultured at 37uC (differentiating condition). Five days after
differentiation had commenced, conditioned media was added to
the cells. The medium was changed to 0.1% FBS on day 7.
Podocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF- a for 36 hours
before harvesting.

Histological assessment
A coronal slice of kidney tissue was fixed in 4% paraformal￾dehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue was cut at 4 mm and
stained with hematoxylin, PAS, and Masson’s trichrome. The
degree of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis were measured
using Image J software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The percent￾age of glomerulosclerosis was calculated by dividing the total area
of PAS positive staining in the glomerulus by the total area of the
glomerulus. Interstitial fibrosis was quantified by dividing the area
of trichrome stained interstitium by the total cortical area. The
mean value of 20 randomly selected glomeruli or five cortical fields
was determined for each section. Five sections were selected from
each kidney.
Antigen Retrieval
Paraffin tissue sections (4 mm) were incubated at 60uC overnight
before dewaxing with 2 changes of xylene and 100% ethanol.
Tissue sections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM
sodium citrate, pH 6.0) and heated up in a pressurized cooker to
100uC for 10 minutes. Tissue sections were cooled down to room
temperature and prepared for standard immunofluorescence
staining procedure.
Confocal Microscopy
Renal sections were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and
incubated with rabbit anti-synaptopodin (1:800) (Sysy antibody,
Germany) or rat anti-CD31 (1:100) overnight at 4uC. Sections

were probed with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-rat with Alexa Fluor
555 conjugate (1:2000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sections
were counterstained with 4, 6-diamidino-2 phenylindole (DAPI) to
visualize nuclei and mounted with Fluorescence Mounting
Medium (Dako Cytomation). Sections were analyzed with an
Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan), FV10-ASW software (version 1.3c; Olympus), oil UPLFL
60x objective (NA1.25; Olympus) at x2 or x3 digital zoom.
Contrast and brightness of the images were adjusted further in
ImageJ.
TUNEL Assay
Apoptotic assays were performed by TdT mediated X-dUTP
nicked labeling (TUNEL) reaction using ApopTagH Fluorescein In
Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Merck Millipore, Kilsyth, Vic,
Australia). Apoptotic endothelial cells and podocytes were
identified by double labelling using TUNEL and anti-CD31 or
anti-synaptopodin. Goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate
(1:2000) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate (1:2000)
were used. Sections were counterstained with DAPI.
Western blotting
Kidney tissues and cell culture samples were sonicated and lysed
in 0.4 ml RIPA lysis buffer. The tissue and cell extracts were
centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4uC for 30 minutes to remove cell
debris. The protein concentrations were measured by modified
Lowry protein assay using BSA as a protein standard (DC protein
assay kit, Biorad). Proteins were electrophoresed through a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel before transferring to a PVDF membrane. After
blocking for 30 minutes at 4uC in blocking buffer (5% skim milk
powder in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was
incubated overnight with rabbit anti-synaptopodin (1:8000) or
rabbit anti-eNOS (1:4000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). The
membrane was washed and incubated for 30 minutes at room
temperature with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with
HRP. After further washing, the membrane was detected with
ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington, IL, USA). a￾tubulin and GAPDH were used as internal controls and detected
by mouse anti-a-tubulin antibody conjugated with HRP and
mouse anti-GAPDH antibody conjugated with HRP. Western
blotting images were captured by Kodak 4000 mm and density of
the bands was quantitated by using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.
gov/ij/).
Statistical Analyses
Data are mean 6 SD with statistical analyses performed using
one way or two-way ANOVA from GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and post test Tukey analysis
when appropriate. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.

normal (Fig. 1A&C, E&G). A single dose of ADR administration
at 10.5 mg/kg body weight in wild type C57BL/6 mice did not
induce any significant injury in kidneys (Fig. 1B&F). However, in
the ADR-treated eNOS-deficient group, PAS (Fig. 1D) and
Masson trichrome staining (Fig. 1H) demonstrated severe histo￾pathological changes including glomerular and tubulointerstitial
damage, massive cast formation, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulo￾interstitial fibrosis. Overt proteinuria appeared 7 days after ADR
administration and persisted thereafter (Fig. 2A). In eNOS￾deficient mice, the mean body weight decreased quickly after
ADR administration and the tendency persisted until day 14, after
which body weight recovered gradually (Fig. 2B). Kidney/body
ratio in eNOS-deficient mice with ADR treatment increased at
day 3, peaked at days 7 and 14 then returned to normal at day 28
(Fig. 2C). Serum creatinine continuously increased following ADR
injection in eNOS-deficient mice and peaked at 4 weeks, the
experimental end-point (Fig. 2D). In eNOS-deficient mice, high
blood pressure persisted during the whole study but there was no
significant change in blood pressure between NS-treated and
ADR-treated groups (Fig. 2E). Immunostaining demonstrated that
the production of collagen IV (Fig. 3 A to D & I) and fibronectin
(Fig. 3E to H & I) was significantly increased in ADR-treated

eNOS-deficient kidneys compared with NS-treated eNOS-defi￾cient, NS-treated wild type and ADR-treated wild type kidneys.
These results demonstrated that ADR administration in eNOS￾deficient C57BL/6 mice leads to progressive renal fibrosis that by
4 weeks resembles chronic renal failure with marked functional
impairment and severe histopathological alterations. These results
suggest that endothelial dysfunction may lead to the development
and progression of chronic kidney disease.

Glomerular endothelial cell injury precedes that of
podocytes after ADR administration in eNOS-deficient
C57BL/6 mice
To compare ADR-induced injury in glomerular endothelial
cells with that in podocytes in mice with eNOS deficiency, CD31
and synaptopodin staining were performed. The loss of CD31 was
evident 3 days after adriamycin administration then persisted until
day 28 (Fig. 4A to E & K) while the expression of synaptopodin
was significantly reduced 7 days after ADR administration (Fig. 4F
to J & L), suggesting that glomerular endothelial cells with eNOS
deficiency are more susceptible to injury than podocytes and that
endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in the development
and progression of ADR-induced nephropathy. To quantify the
rate of apoptosis in glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes,
TUNEL was performed in conjunction with CD31 and synapto￾podin staining. Positive cells in 50 glomeruli of at least five animals
of each group were counted. As expected, the number of
glomerular endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis (CD31+/
TUNEL+) peaked at 3 days after adriamycin was administered,
then gradually decreased at days 7 and 14 (Fig. 5A to C).
However, the number of podocytes undergoing apoptosis peaked
at 7 days after adriamycin treatment (Fig. 5D to F), demonstrating
that adriamycin-induced glomerular endothelial cell injury
precedes that of podocytes in eNOS-deficient mice, suggesting
that endothelial dysfunction may result in podocyte injury.
Glomerular endothelial dysfunction precedes podocyte
injury in ADR-induced kidney damage in Balb/c mice
It is believed that ADR-induced nephropathy is initiated by
podocyte injury followed by overt proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis,
tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation in ADR-susceptible
mice [35,36]. In an attempt to address the role of endothelial
dysfunction in the development and progression of ADR-induced
podocyte injury, the expression of eNOS and synaptopodin were
examined by Western blotting in kidneys from Balb/c mice.
Interestingly, the down-regulation of eNOS was significantly

earlier than that of synaptopodin being prominent 24 hours and
7 days after ADR administration, respectively (Fig. 6A&B).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that CD31 (Fig. 6C, D & G)
and synaptopodin (Fig. 6E, F & H) were significantly decreased
7 days after ADR treatment. TUNEL demonstrated that glomer￾ular endothelial cells (CD31+/TUNEL+) and podocytes (synapto￾podin+/TUNEL+) undergoing apoptosis could be detected as
early as 24 hours in glomerular endothelial cells (Fig. 7C & E) but
at 7 days in podocytes (Fig. 7D & E) after ADR treatment
compared with NS treatment. This suggests that glomerular
endothelial dysfunction and damage precede podocyte injury in an
ADR-susceptible mouse strain.
eNOS overexpression in endothelial cells protects
podocytes from TNF-a-induced injury
To further investigate the role of glomerular endothelial cells in
the development and progression of podocyte injury, mouse
microvascular endothelial cells (MMECs) over-expressing GFP￾tagged eNOS were generated. MMECs expressing GFP-tagged
eNOS (GFP-eNOS+
) were selected by FACS while GFP￾eNOS2MMECs were used as a negative control (Fig. 8A).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the majority of the
cultured GFP-eNOS+ MMECs expressed GFP-tagged eNOS
(Fig. 8C) compared with GFP-eNOS2MMECs (Fig. 8B). Western
blotting also confirmed the expression of GFP-eNOS and
endogenous eNOS in MMECs (Fig. 8D). Conditioned medium
from GFP-eNOS+ MMECs and GFP-eNOS2MMECs were
added to podocytes in the presence or absence of TNF- a.
Western blotting demonstrated that TNF-a significantly induced
loss of synaptopodin in podocytes under conditioned medium from
GFP-eNOS2MMECs while conditioned medium from GFP￾eNOS+ MMECs protected podocytes from TNF-a-induced loss
of synaptopodin (Fig. 8E&F), suggesting that eNOS over
expression in MMECs may protect podocyte from inflammatory
insult.
Discussion
In the present study using two mouse strains C57BL/6, an ADR
resistant strain, and Balb/c, an ADR-susceptible strain, we have
demonstrated that one of the important factors in driving ADR￾induced nephropathy is the level of expression of eNOS. eNOS
deficient C57BL/6 mice when treated with ADR developed overt
proteinuria, persistent glomerular endothelial cell and podocyte
injury, progressive glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis
and inflammation. These results suggest that endothelial dysfunc￾tion may play a critical role in the development and progression of
chronic kidney disease. We also demonstrated that glomerular
endothelial cell injury precedes that of podocytes after ADR
treatment in both ADR-resistant and ADR-susceptible strains.
Using a reciprocal approach we demonstrated that conditioned
medium from MMECs over expressing eNOS protected podo￾cytes from TNF-a-induced injury, suggesting that glomerular
endothelial cells may also play a protective role in the pathogenesis
of chronic kidney disease.
Adriamycin, a putative podocyte toxin [37], induces rapid
production of reactive oxygen species and advanced glycation end￾products (AGEs) and upregulation of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)
[38]. Guo et al [38] demonstrated that RAGE-deficient mice were
protected from ADR-induced podocyte injury, albuminuria and
glomerulosclerosis, suggesting that ADR-induced nephropathy is
initiated at least partially through RAGE. However, they did not
show whether ADR also induced glomerular endothelial cell injury
as RAGE is expressed in both podocytes [39] and glomerular
endothelial cells [40] though at low levels. Pathological insults,
such as ADR treatment [34] and diabetes [40] can significantly
increase RAGE expression in both podocytes and glomerular
endothelial cells. The interaction of AGEs and RAGE can
significantly reduce eNOS mRNA and protein expression in
human umbilical vein cords endothelial cells [41]. The present
study demonstrated that eNOS deficiency makes C57BL/6 mice,
a strain resistant to ADR, susceptible to ADR-induced nephrop￾athy. In Balb/c mice, a susceptible strain, the reduction of eNOS
and glomerular endothelial dysfunction appeared as early as
24 hours after ADR treatment, suggesting that both podocyte and
glomerular endothelial cell injury contributes to the development
and progression of glomerulopathy.
In this study we used a low dose of ADR (10.5 mg/kg). Using a
high dose of ADR (25 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice Jeansson et al
[42] demonstrated a 80% reduction in the thickness of the
glomerular endothelial surface layer and significant loss of charge
density and size selectivity of the glomerular barrier. They did not
show long-term pathological changes in ADR-treated kidneys.
Their study suggests that the glomerular endothelial cells may
contribute to the development and progression of proteinuric renal
diseases. Our study further demonstrated that glomerular endo￾thelial cell dysfunction preceded podocyte injury and that
glomerular endothelial cells underwent apoptosis earlier than
podocytes, further supporting the notion that besides podocytes,
glomerular endothelial cells also play an important role in
glomerulopathy.
Earlier studies [43,44] have shown that mice with eNOS
deficiency had significantly elevated blood pressures associated
with increase in renin activities. In the present study, ADR
treatment did not further alter the increased blood pressures
compared with NS treatment in eNOS-deficient mice, suggesting
that high blood pressure may contribute to the initiation of ADR￾induced kidney injury but ADR-induced kidney damage per se did
not have an impact on blood pressure.
Podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells cross-talk through
the secretion of cytokines and growth factors [45–48]. Sison et al
[46] elegantly demonstrated through the use of genetically
modified animals that vascular endothelial growth factor-A
(VEGF-A) secreted by podocytes binds to VEGFR2 on adjacent
endothelial cells to participate in kidney development and to
maintain endothelial cell survival and function. Davis et al [47]
demonstrated that podocyte-specific expression of angiopoietin-2
induced apoptosis of the glomerular endothelial cells and
proteinuria but the podocytes and the GBM remained intact.
Slater et al [48] demonstrated that co-culture of human glomer￾ular endothelial cell under laminar shear stress with podocytes
resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Vasodilator￾stimulated phosphoprotein at S157 and S239 in podocytes and a
decrease in podocyte barrier resistance. These results suggest that
glomerular endothelial cells under stress may release mediators to
cross-talk with podocytes thus influencing podocyte behaviour. In
our study podocytes cultured with conditioned media from
MMECs over-expressing eNOS were resistant to TNF-a-induced
loss of synaptopodin, providing direct evidence that glomerular
endothelial cells may protect podocytes from inflammatory insult
through secreting mediators or change their production of a
variety of cytokines, proteoglycans and growth factors. What
mediators are released from endothelial cells and the exact
mechanisms on how endothelial cells influence podocytes requires
further investigation.
The other cell type that needs to be considered in the
glomerulus is the mesangial cell which expresses nitric oxide
(NO) receptors [49]. Mesangial cells require NO to survive and

regulate their function [50,51]. In fact, eNOS deficiency also has
an impact on mesangial cells, as evidenced by mesangiolysis [6–8].
The interaction between glomerular endothelial cells and mesan￾gial cells warrants further investigation.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that endothelial
dysfunction and damage precedes podocyte injury in ADR￾induced nephropathy. In addition, glomerular endothelial cells
may protect podocytes through secreting mediators. Understand￾ing the role of glomerular endothelial dysfunction in the
pathogenesis of glomerular injury and sclerosis will greatly aid in
the design of novel therapeutic approaches for slowing the
progressive of renal disease.
