Background: The objective of this retrospective study was to determine if there are any differences in grafted kidney 
function in recipients of kidney transplantation (KT) when donors and recipients were anesthetized with sevoflurane 
compared to desflurane. 
Methods: Seventy-three pairs of donors-recipients were anesthetized with sevoflurane (Sevo group) and 71 pairs 
were anesthetized with desflurane (Des group). We retrospectively investigated the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, 
creatinine (Cr) levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) of the recipients in both groups for 1 year 
postoperatively. We tested non-inferiority for serum creatinine at discharge and 1 year after KT. Short-term (1 year) 
outcomes of KT were assessed by the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection episodes (ARE), and 
graft failure. 
Results: There were no differences in BUN, Cr, eGFR, or outcomes of KT at 1 year postoperatively. Specifically, the 
95% confidence interval for the difference in creatinine levels between the Sevo and Des groups was less than the 
margin of equivalence at the time of discharge and 1 year after surgery. The occurrences of DGF, ARE, and graft 
failure were comparable between the groups. 
Conclusions: Compared to desflurane, sevoflurane had no adverse effects on grafted renal function or on the short￾term outcome of renal transplantation. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2012; 62: 529-535)

Sevoflurane and kidney transplantation Vol. 62, No. 6, June 2012
Introduction
Currently, kidney transplantation (KT) is the treatment 
of choice for patients with end-stage renal failure. The 
transplantation surgery is commonly performed under general 
anesthesia using a volatile anesthetic agent. However, sevo￾flurane - a commonly used volatile anesthetic - has the potential 
to adversely affect the function of a grafted kidney as well as 
the outcome of KT because an inorganic fluoride ion produced 
during sevoflurane metabolism is related to methoxyflurane￾induced nephrotoxicity [1]. Furthermore, compound A - another 
product of sevoflurane metabolism in the presence of carbon 
dioxide - can affect the breathing circuit and has been shown 
to cause renal damage in animals [2]. Although it has been 
generally accepted that sevoflurane can be used without 
concern for nephrotoxicity [3], this is the subject of a debate that 
is still ongoing because of a number of reports of sevoflurane￾induced nephrotoxicity in humans [4-8].
Furthermore, grafted kidneys are very sensitive during 
transplantation. Various factors, such as ischemia-reperfusion 
(IR) injury, can cause early renal dysfunction, which can 
increase the risk of acute rejection episodes and graft failure 
[9,10]. Reports regarding the effects of sevoflurane on 
transplanted kidneys are limited, although there have been 
several suggestions of increased risk of renal damage while 
using sevoflurane [11]. 
Therefore, the objective of this retrospective study was to 
determine whether there are any differences in grafted kidney 
function in recipients or in the outcomes of KT when donors 
and recipients were anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to 
desflurane.
Materials and Methods
After approval from the Institutional Review Board, we 
performed a retrospective review of the electronic medical 
records at our institution, of patients 20 years or older who 
had received a kidney transplant from a living donor from 
January 2006 to June 2009. We included pairs of donors and 
recipients where the recipient had been anesthetized with the 
same volatile anesthetics as the donor. Among the selected 
pairs, those with incomplete medical records or unstable 
hemodynamic events during the transplantation operation 
were excluded from the study (Fig. 1). We defined an unstable 
hemodynamic event as documentation of an intra-operative 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 30% below baseline 
or a blood oxygen saturation of less than 95%. We ultimately 
identified 149 eligible pairs for this study. The pairs were 
divided into three groups: pairs anesthetized with sevoflurane 
(n = 73, Sevo group), pairs anesthetized with desflurane (n = 71, 
Des group), and pairs anaesthetized with isoflurane (n = 5). We 
excluded the pairs anesthetized with isoflurane because of the 
small sample size. 
All donors and recipients were administered general 
anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. Induction of anesthesia 
was performed with an intravenous anesthetic (propofol or 
thiopental), an opioid (fentanyl or remifentanil), and a muscle 
relaxant (atracurium, vecuronium, or rocuronium). A balanced 
anesthetic technique was performed for maintenance anesthesia 
using a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane or desflurane), an opioid 
(intermittent intravenous fentanyl or an intravenous infusion 
of remifentanil), and a muscle relaxant (intravenous infusion of 
atracurium). Soda lime was used as a carbon dioxide absorbent 
in all patients.
An immunosuppressed condition was achieved using the 
following regimen in both groups: induction of immuno￾suppression with baciliximab and methylprednisolone 
and maintenance with calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine 
or tacrolimus [FK 506]), methylprednisolone, and an anti￾metabolite (mycophenolic acid or mizoribine).
We analyzed the factors affecting grafted kidney function 
and compared them between the Sevo group and the Des 
group. These factors included the following: age, sex, weight, 
height, co-morbid disease, preoperative serum level of blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), intra-operative intake/
Fig. 1. Flowchart of data acquisition. Of the patients who underwent 
kidney transplantation from a living donor from January 2006 to 
June 2009, this study included donor-recipient pairs in which the 
recipient had been anesthetized with the same volatile anesthetic 
as the donor. We excluded the pairs in which isoflurane was used 
because of the small sample size. Finally, the enrolled pairs were 
divided into groups, the sevoflurane group (n = 73, Sevo group) and 
the desflurane group (n = 71, Des group). IMR, incomplete medical

output, total ischemic time, number of matched human leukocyte 
antigens (HLA)-A, B, and HLA-DR, and type of calcineurin 
inhibitor. Function of the grafted kidney was estimated by the 
serum level of BUN, Cr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, 4, and 7, at discharge, and 
at 12 months after transplantation. The eGFR was calculated 
using the MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease) 
equation. We also investigated the frequency of delayed graft 
function (DGF), treated acute rejection episodes (ARE), and 
graft loss within one year of transplantation. DGF was indicated 
in graft recipients who underwent dialysis during the first week 
after transplantation. ARE included both biopsy-proven acute 
rejection and clinically suspected acute rejection. We defined 
a graft loss as the initiation of long-term dialysis therapy after 
transplantation.
Data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL, USA). We used an independent t-test to compare the 
grafted kidney function between the two groups. We tested non￾inferiority for serum creatinine at discharge and 1 yr after KT. 
To test non-inferiority or equivalence, a margin of equivalence 
(the largest difference that is not of practical significance) 
must first be defined. Because the increase of 0.3 mg/dl of 
serum creatinine is attributed to ‘risk’ criteria according to the 
definition of acute kidney injury [12], a maximum difference 
of 0.3 mg/dl in the serum creatinine was considered as equi￾valence. The Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the 
frequency of DGF between the two groups. A P value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Results
There were no significant differences in donor and recipient 
demographics or intraoperative data between the Sevo group 
and the Des group (Table 1).

Grafted kidney function during the immediate postoperative 
period was comparable between the two groups (Fig. 2). There 
were 2 patients with DGF in the Sevo group and 1 patient with 
DGF in the Des group; this difference was not statistically 
significant.
The duration of hospitalization and grafted kidney function 
at the time of discharge were comparable between the groups. 
The short-term outcomes of transplantation and transplanted 
renal function at 1 year after renal transplantation were also 
comparable between the two groups, as both groups showed 
no significant differences in the occurrence of ARE or graft loss 
for 1 year after transplantation (Table 2). The mean difference 
in serum creatinine and their 95% confidence interval (CI) are 
presented in Table 3. At the time of discharge, the 95% CI (Sevo 
group minus Des group) fell within the margin of equivalence, 
and therefore the grafted kidney function on the discharge day 
between the groups was considered as equivalent. However, 
because the 95% CI at the time of 1 year after surgery included

-0.3, the grafted kidney function of the Sevo group at that time 
was considered as non-inferior, rather than equivalent, to that 
of the Des group.
Discussion
The results of this retrospective study provide no direct 
evidence that sevoflurane has deleterious effects on grafted 
kidney function compared to desflurane because there were no 
differences in postoperative serum creatinine, BUN, estimated 
GFR, or urine output between the sevoflurane and desflurane 
groups. Also, the outcomes of renal transplantation surgery at 
1 year after surgery were comparable between the Sevo group 
and the Des group. Finally, we can conclude that sevoflurane 
does not adversely affect grafted renal function at the time 
of discharge and at 1 year after transplantation because the 
differences in creatinine between the two groups (Sevo group 
minus Des group) were less than 0.3 mg/dl, which is the margin 
of equivalence.
A previous report has already demonstrated that sevoflurane 
has no detectable effect on the outcome of kidney trans￾plantation [13]. This report assessed renal function in recipients 
anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to isoflurane, irrespec￾tive of the anesthetics used for the donors. However, in animal 
studies and a in handful of human studies, renal damage related 
to sevoflurane has been reported to be correlated with the 
exposure duration and the concentration of serum inorganic 
fluoride ion and inspired compound A [3]. As such, the 
transplanted kidneys may have been exposed to fluoride and 
compound A if the donors were anesthetized with sevoflurane. 
Therefore, if sevoflurane has an adverse effect on renal graft 
function, it should be more pronounced in grafted kidneys in 
which both the donor and recipient were anesthetized with 
sevoflurane.
Inorganic fluoride was suggested to be nephrotoxic in 
studies using methoxyflurane [14,15]. Although Higuchi et 
al. reported that elevated serum fluoride concentrations 
(> 50 μmol/L) secondary to sevoflurane may contribute to post￾operative renal impairment [4], there was no such relationship 
between the serum fluoride concentrations and nephrotoxicity 
in the majority of other studies that used sevoflurane [3,11]. 
In contrast, compound A has been reported to be correlated 
with renal toxicity in several studies. In human volunteers, 
compound A, at concentrations ranging from 150 to 342 
ppm-h after sevoflurane administration, induced transient 
abnormalities in urine biochemical markers [4,5]. Furthermore, 
compound A exposures of 240 ppm-h from sevoflurane resulted 
in albuminuria and increased excretion of α-glutathione-S￾transferase (a biochemical marker in urine) [7]. Additionally, 
surgical patients with low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia were 
exposed to compound A at 214 ppm-h and exhibited mild, 
transient proteinuria and increased excretion of N-acetyl￾β-D-glucosaminidase (a lysosomal enzyme located in the 
proximal renal tubule) [8]. Nevertheless, no studies have 
ever reported nephrotoxicity induced by sevoflurane that 
could be detected by routine clinical tests of renal function 
(serum BUN, Cr, or creatinine clearance). This suggests that 
nephrotoxicity secondary to sevoflurane may be too mild and 
transient to affect renal function. Additionally, there were 
also no detectable influences on renal function secondary to 
sevoflurane in patients with stable renal insufficiency [16,17]. 
Based on these studies, since 2006, sevoflurane has been 
administered to patients undergoing renal transplantation in 
our institution. However, grafted kidneys could be damaged 
by various factors during and even after renal transplantation. 
IR injury during the transplantation procedure may contribute 
to delayed graft function. This could subsequently increase 
allograft immunogenicity and increase the risk of acute 
rejection episodes, which could ultimately result in graft failure 
[9,10]. Furthermore, immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine 
or tacrolimus used after renal transplantation can cause 
nephrotoxicity, although they do result in decreased acute 
rejection rates and improved short-term outcomes [18]. These 
conditions in which the kidney grafts can be damaged during 
and after surgery are so unique that they are not observed in 
other types of surgeries. Renal damage secondary to sevoflurane 
may occur under these conditions, although nephrotoxicity 
attributable to sevoflurane is clinically insignificant in patients 
with stable renal insufficiency. Therefore, we need to confirm 
whether sevoflurane can safely be used in patients undergoing 
renal transplantation.
There is yet another issue regarding sevoflurane and renal 
function in renal transplantation. There have been several 
reports suggesting the protective effects of volatile anesthetics 
against renal IR injury [19-21]. These protective effects have not 
been definitively established; however, these reports suggest 
that volatile anesthetics may actually have a positive effect 
on the human kidney. In clinical practice, potential evidence 
for renal protection by volatile anesthetics was illustrated in 
a recent study by Julier et al. [22]. Their study showed that 
sevoflurane pretreatment before cardiopulmonary bypass for 
coronary artery bypass grafting surgery markedly improved

postoperative GFR as determined by the plasma concentration 
of cystatin C. Therefore, sevoflurane may confer positive effects 
on renal graft function by reducing IR injury.
There are several limitations to this study. First, we could 
not assess the levels of inorganic fluoride and compound 
A. Therefore, we could not confirm whether these affect the 
grafted kidney function. In addition, we evaluated the function 
of the grafted kidney, not the severity of damage related to 
sevoflurane. To clarify the nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane, we 
need to assess the renal injury using a novel biomarker such 
as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). NGAL 
has emerged as a new diagnostic tool for acute kidney injury 
[23]. In kidney transplant patients, NGAL not only predicts DGF 
[24,25], but also correlates with grafted kidney function [26,27]. 
Second, we were unable to confirm whether or not sevoflurane 
had an effect on grafted renal function in the immediate post￾transplantation period. However, we showed that there was 
no deterioration in grafted renal function in the Sevo group at 
the time of discharge and 1 year after renal transplantation. 
Therefore, we believe that sevoflurane can safely be used in 
patients undergoing renal transplantation.
In conclusion, sevoflurane has no adverse effects on renal 
graft function or on the short-term outcome of renal trans￾plantation compared to desflurane.
