Abstract
We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin II–induced hy￾pertension is associated with an increase in vascular ?O2
2
production, and characterized the oxidase involved in this
process. Infusion of angiotensin II (0.7 mg/kg per d) in￾creased systolic blood pressure and doubled vascular ?O2
2
production (assessed by lucigenin chemiluminescence), pre￾dominantly from the vascular media. NE infusion (2.75 mg/
kg per d) produced a similar degree of hypertension, but did
not increase vascular ?O2
2 production. Studies using vari￾ous enzyme inhibitors and vascular homogenates suggested
that the predominant source of ?O2
2 activated by angio￾tensin II infusion is an NADH/NADPH-dependent, mem￾brane-bound oxidase. Angiotensin II–, but not NE-, induced
hypertension was associated with impaired relaxations to
acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore A23187, and nitro￾glycerin. These relaxations were variably corrected by treat￾ment of vessels with liposome-encapsulated superoxide dis￾mutase. When Losartan was administered concomitantly
with angiotensin II, vascular ?O2
2 production and relax￾ations were normalized, demonstrating a role for the angio￾tensin type-1 receptor in these processes. We conclude that
forms of hypertension associated with elevated circulating
levels of angiotensin II may have unique vascular effects not
shared by other forms of hypertension because they increase
vascular smooth muscle ?O2
2 production via NADH/
NADPH oxidase activation. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1916–
1923.) Key words: hypertension • superoxide • nitric oxide •

Introduction
Angiotensin II exerts numerous effects on the cardiovascular
system. These include vasoconstriction, induction of vascular
smooth muscle cell growth (1, 2), stimulation of protoonco￾gene expression (3–5), modulation of myocardial hypertrophy
and fibrosis (6–9), and modulation of ventricular remodeling
after myocardial infarction (for review see reference 10). A va￾riety of pathologic states, including certain forms of hyperten￾sion, congestive heart failure, and nitrate tolerance are associ￾ated with elevated plasma renin activity and circulating levels
of angiotensin II. Additionally, renin and angiotensin II pro￾duced locally in the vessel wall may have important autocrine
and paracrine effects, even in the setting of normal or low cir￾culating angiotensin II levels (10).
Traditionally, it has been thought that the predominant ef￾fect of angiotensin II on vascular tone was achieved via its di￾rect vasoconstrictor effect, mediated via interactions with the
vascular smooth muscle angiotensin type-1 (AT1)
1
 receptor.
Endothelial cells also possess angiotensin II receptors, and can
release both nitric oxide (11) and vasoconstrictor prostanoids
(under certain pathophysiological conditions) in response to
the octapeptide (12).
Recently, a novel signaling mechanism for angiotensin II
has been described, which may have important implications
for both its physiological and pathophysiological effects. In
cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, 3–4 h treatment with
angiotensin II increases production of ?O2
2 anions via mem￾brane-bound NADH- and NADPH-driven oxidases (13). The
pathways leading to this activation remain undefined, but
likely involve stimulation of phospholipase A2
 and the release
of aracidonic acid.
These previous studies were performed in cultured vascu￾lar smooth muscle cells after several passages. Such cells un￾dergo transformation to a synthetic phenotype and exhibit sig￾naling responses to angiotensin II which may differ from
responses of the vascular smooth muscle in vivo. Because of
these issues, it was not clear that a similar effect could be pro￾duced by modest levels of angiotensin II in vivo. In the present
experiments, we examined the effect of angiotensin II–induced
hypertension on vascular ?O2
2 production and attempted to
characterize the oxidase activated. Studies were also per￾formed to determine if another form of pharmacologically in￾duced hypertension, that due to the infusion of NE, had simi￾lar effects on vascular ?O2
2 production. Finally, we sought to
determine if this alteration in vascular ?O2
2 production had
any impact on endothelial regulation of vasomotion.

Angiotensin II and Vascular Oxidases 1917
traperitoneal ketamine 80 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg. Using sterile
techniques, an incision was made in the midscapular region and os￾motic minipumps (Alzet model 2002; Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA)
containing angiotensin II (infusion rate 0.7 mg/kg per d) were im￾planted. Sham-operated animals underwent an identical surgical pro￾cedure, except that either no pump, or an empty osmotic pump, was
implanted.
Systolic blood pressures were measured by tail cuff plethysmogra￾phy immediately before surgery, and in most animals immediately be￾fore death. In some animals (n 5 12), daily systolic pressures were ob￾tained to examine the time course of blood pressure rise in response
to the angiotensin II infusion.
On the fifth day of angiotensin II infusion, the animals were given
a lethal injection of Na pentobarbital. After the pentobarbital injec￾tion, but before death, heparin (2,500 U) was given via intracardiac
injection. The aortas were harvested and used in subsequent studies.
In some studies, the selective AT1
 receptor antagonist Losartan
(Dupont-Merck, Wilmington, DE) (25 mg/kg per d) was administered
in the drinking water for 2 d before and during angiotensin II infu￾sions.
To examine vascular production of ?O2
2 in another model of hy￾pertension, a similar protocol was followed in additional studies, ex￾cept that NE (2.8 mg/kg per d) was infused. For these studies, NE was
dissolved in 0.2 mM sodium metabisulfite and pH adjusted to 5.0 to
ensure stability.
In a final series of rats, we examined the effect of low dose angio￾tensin II infusion (0.3 mg/kg per d).
Vessel preparation. The aorta was placed in chilled, modified
Krebs/Hepes buffer (buffer A composition [mM]: NaCl, 99.01; KCl,
4.69; CaCl2
, 1.87; MgSO4
, 1.20; K2HPO4
, 1.03; NaHCO3
, 25.0; Na￾Hepes, 20.0, and glucose, 11.1, pH 7.4), cleaned of excessive adventitial
tissue, and cut into 5-mm ring segments. In some vessels, the endothe￾lium was removed by inserting the closed tips of a metal hemostat
into the ring segment and rolling it gently on moistened filter paper.
Estimation of vascular ?O2
2 production. ?O2
2 anion production
was measured using lucigenin chemiluminescence. The details of this
assay have been published previously (14–16). Briefly, after prepara￾tion, the vessels were placed in a modified Krebs/Hepes buffer and al￾lowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 378C. Scintillation vials containing 2
ml Krebs/Hepes buffer with 250 mM lucigenin were placed into a
scintillation counter switched to the out-of-coincidence mode. After
dark adaptation, background counts were recorded and a vascular
segment was added to the vial. Scintillation counts were then re￾corded every 2 min for 15 min, and the respective background counts
were subtracted. The vessels were then dried by placing them in a
908C oven for 24 h, for determination of dry weight. Lucigen counts
were expressed as counts · 103
 per min per mg dry weight.
In some experiments, either diphenylene iodinium (10 mM), oxy￾purinol (100 mM), rotenone (100 mM) NG-monomethyl-L-arginine
(L-NMMA) (10 mM), or indomethacin (10 mM) was added to the ves￾sel segments to examine a role for flavin-containing enzymes, xan￾thine oxidase, mitochondrial respiration, nitric oxide synthase, and
cyclooxygenase, respectively.
Examination of sources of ? O2
2 in vascular homogenates. Aortic
segments (2–3 cm) were placed in chilled buffer A. Periadventitial tis￾sue was carefully removed and the vessels were repeatedly washed to
remove adherent blood cells. A 10% vessel homogenate was pre￾pared by homogenizing in a glass-to-glass motorized homogenizer
(Contorque power unit; Eberbach Corp, Ann Arbor, MI). The ho￾mogenizing buffer (buffer B) was a 50-mM phosphate buffer which
contained 0.01 mM EDTA. The homogenate was subjected to low
speed centrifugation (1,000 g) for 10 min to remove unbroken cells
and debris. 20-ml aliquots of the supernatant were then added to glass
scintillation vials containing 250 mm lucigenin in 2 ml buffer B. The
chemiluminescence which occurred over the ensuing 5 min in re￾sponse to the addition of either NADH or NADPH (both 100 mM)
was recorded. In preliminary experiments, homogenates alone, with￾out addition of NADH or NADPH, gave only minimal signals. Also,
neither NADH nor NADPH evoked lucigenin chemiluminescence in
the absence of homogenate. In some experiments, arachidonic acid
(100 mM), xanthine (100 nM), succinate (5 mM, with and without 30
mM antimycin A) were added to determine if these could act as sub￾strates for superoxide production. Antimycin A was used to inhibit
the complex III of mitochondrial electron transport, while succinate
was used as a substrate for this process. The combination of these two
would exaggerate any contribution of electron leak from mitochon￾drial sources. ?O2
2 production in response to NADH was also exam￾ined after the addition of indomethacin (10 mM), nordihydroguaretic
acid (100 mM), or L-NMMA (10 mM). Other experiments were per￾formed in the presence of heparin-binding superoxide dismutase to
determine the superoxide dismutase inhibitable fraction. The latter is
a recombinant superoxide dismutase with an affinity for glycosami￾noglycans on the plasma membrane.
In additional experiments, vessels were initially homogenized in
buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer [pH 7.4] containing the protease in￾hibitors, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, bee￾statin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin A, and 0.1%
2-mercaptoethanol). The supernatant from the low speed centrifuga￾tion was subjected to 100,000 g ultracentrifugation for 45 min to sepa￾rate membrane and cytosolic fractions. 20 ml of either the supernatant
or the particulate fraction (which had been resuspended in 250 ml
buffer C) were used to examine oxidase activity of these cellular sub￾fractions. The chemiluminescence signals were standardized using a
standard curve generated from known quantities of xanthine and
xanthine oxidase. Values were standardized to the amount of protein
present. Protein content was measured using a commercially avail￾able kit (DC protein assay; Bio Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Isolated vascular ring experiments. Eight 5-mm ring segments of
the thoracic aorta were suspended in individual organ chambers filled
with Krebs buffer (25 ml) of the following composition (mM): NaCl,
118.3; KCl, 4.69; CaCl2
, 1.87; MgSO4
, 1.20; K2HPO4
, 1.03; NaHCO3
,
25.0; and glucose, 11.1, pH 7.40. The solution was aerated continu￾ously with a 95% O2
-, 5% CO2
 mixture and maintained at 378C. Care
was taken not to injure the endothelium during preparation of the
rings. Tension was recorded with a linear force transducer. Over a pe￾riod of 1 h, the resting tension was gradually increased and the ring
segment frequently exposed to 80 mM KCl, until the optimal tension
for generating force during isometric contraction was reached. In pre￾liminary experiments, this proved to be 2.0 g in all subsets of animals.
The vessels were left at this resting tension throughout the remainder
of the study. To prevent synthesis of PGs, we performed all experi￾ments in the presence of 10 mM indomethacin. The vessels were then
precontracted with L-phenylephrine (0.15 mM). In experiments where
vessels from NE-treated animals were studied, PG F2a (3 mM) was
employed to obtain preconstricted tone. This vasoconstrictor was
used because the previous NE treatment prevented constrictions to
reasonable concentrations of phenylephrine. For these studies, sepa￾rate sham-operated and angiotensin II–treated rats were used. After
a stable contraction plateau was reached, the rings were exposed to
either acetylcholine (1 nM–3 mM), the calcium ionophore A23187 (1
nM–1 mM), or nitroglycerin (1 nM–1 mM).
Liposomal-encapsulated superoxide dismutase. In previous stud￾ies, we have found that administration of conventional Cu-Zn super￾oxide dismutase only minimally increases vascular superoxide dismu￾tase levels (16, 17). We therefore augmented the vascular levels of
superoxide dismutase by using liposomal-encapsulated superoxide
dismutase prepared as previously described (16). Aortic rings from
control and angiotensin II–treated rats were incubated for 30–45 min
at 378C in a Krebs/Hepes buffer containing 750 U/ml of liposomal￾encapsulated superoxide dismutase (final vol 1.0 ml). Thereafter, the
aortic rings were removed from the liposomal-encapsulated superox￾ide dismutase solution, washed, and placed in organ chambers as de￾scribed above. Liposomes without superoxide dismutase (empty lipo￾somes) were used as controls for these experiments.
Data analysis. Data in the manuscript are expressed as mean6SEM.
Comparisons between groups of animals or treatments were made us-

ing one-way ANOVA. When significance was indicated, a Student￾Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis was used. To examine interactions
between angiotensin II or sham treatment and liposome-encapsu￾lated superoxide dismutase administration, a two-way ANOVA was
used, where either sham or angiotensin II treatment was one inde￾pendent variable and either empty liposomes or liposome-encapsu￾lated superoxide dismutase administration was the other independent
variable. Significance was considered present when P was , 0.05.
Results
Effect of angiotensin II and NE on systolic blood pressure.
Angiotensin II infusion (0.7 mg/kg per d) caused a progressive
increase in systolic blood pressure from 13062 mmHg to
19266 mmHg by the fifth day before death. NE infusion
caused a similar increase in blood pressure from 13063 to
18967 mmHg (Fig. 1). Losartan prevented the rise in blood
pressure in response to angiotensin II infusion (systolic pres￾sure 12564 mmHg before death).
Vascular ?O2
2 production. Superoxide production by vas￾cular segments from sham-operated animals averaged 5.360.3
counts ? 103
 per mg dry wt of vessel per min and was increased
twofold in vascular segments from angiotensin II–treated rats
(P , 0.001, Fig. 2). In contrast, NE infusion had no effect on
vascular superoxide production (Fig. 2). Treatment with Losar￾tan decreased ?O2
2 production in vascular segments from an￾giotensin II–infused rats to a value below that observed in ves￾sels from sham-operated rats (P , 0.001). Removal of the
endothelium decreased lucigenin chemiluminescence in vessel
segments from both sham and angiotensin II–treated rats to a
small but equal extent (Table I). Incubation with 10 mM diphen￾ylene iodinium for 10 min markedly attenuated the lucigenin
signal in both shams and angiotensin II–treated segments (Ta￾ble I). In contrast, neither oxypurinol, rotenone, L-NMMA,
nor indomethacin affected the lucigenin signal in intact vascu￾lar segments (Table I).
Superoxide production by vascular homogenates. Superoxide
production in response to the addition of a variety of sub￾strates was examined in vascular homogenates. In homoge￾nates of vessels from sham-operated animals, the ?O2
2 gener￾ated in response to NADH was z 1.6-fold higher than that
generated by NADPH (12.161 vs 7.7861 nmol?min21

, respectively, P , 0.05, Fig 3). In homogenates from
angiotensin II–treated animals, the effect of both NADH and
NADPH on ?O2
2 generation was approximately doubled (Fig.
3). Heparin-binding superoxide dismutase (30 U/ml), a recom￾binant form of superoxide dismutase, which contains a gly￾cosaminoglycan binding region, was highly effective in reduc￾ing the chemiluminescence signal. It decreased lucigenin

Angiotensin II and Vascular Oxidases 1919
In contrast to NADH and NADPH, arachidonic acid, xan￾thine, and succinate (in the presence of antimycin A) produced
only small increases in chemiluminescence by vascular homo￾genates (Fig. 3).

sham-vessel homogenates (245661 vs 11765 nmol? min21

, respectively, Fig. 4). Cytosolic activity was minimal
(Fig. 4).
Vascular relaxations in angiotensin II–induced hyperten￾sion. Acetylcholine produced a 9163% relaxation of aortic
segments from sham-operated controls. This effect of acetyl￾choline was markedly reduced in vessels from angiotensin II–
treated animals (Fig. 5 and Table II). Treatment with Losartan
prevented the impairment of relaxations to acetylcholine in
angiotensin II–treated animals (Fig. 5, Table II). Relaxations
to nitroglycerin were blunted by approximately one-half log in
the angiotensin II–treated vessels compared to control vessels
(Table III).
To determine if the alteration in endothelium-dependent
vascular relaxation was due to an effect of hypertension or the
effect of angiotensin II in stimulating ?O2
2 production, we also
examined vascular responses in NE-treated rats. In contrast to
the effect of angiotensin II–induced hypertension, NE-induced
hypertension had no effect on relaxations to either acetylcho￾line, the calcium ionophore A23187, or nitroglycerin (Fig. 6
and Table III).
Effect of liposome-encapsulated superoxide dismutase on
endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Liposome-encapsu￾lated superoxide dismutase markedly increased peak relax￾ations to acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187 in
vessels from angiotensin II–treated animals (Fig. 7, Table IV).
Relaxations to nitroglycerin were substantially blunted in ves￾sels from angiotensin II–treated animals, and were normalized
by treatment with liposome-encapsulated superoxide dismu￾tase (Fig. 7, Table IV). In control vessels, liposome-encapsu￾lated superoxide dismutase produced a small leftward shift in
the dose-response curve to acetylcholine (Fig. 7, Table IV).
Two-way ANOVA revealed an interaction between liposome￾encapsulated superoxide dismutase and angiotensin II vs sham
treatment, such that the effect of the superoxide dismutase was
greatest in the angiotensin II–treated animals.
Effect of low dose angiotensin II on vascular oxidase activ￾ity. To further dissociate the pressure-dependent and inde￾pendent effects of angiotensin II, we studied an additional 10
rats. Five were treated with low dose angiotensin II (0.3 mg/kg
per d) and five served as sham-operated controls. 5 d after an￾Figure 3. Production of ?O2

Discussion
In these studies, we found that angiotensin II–induced hyper￾tension is associated with increased vascular ?O2
2 production
and impaired vascular relaxations to acetylcholine, the calcium
ionophore A23187, and nitroglycerin. In studies of vascular
homogenates, the predominant source of this increased ?O2
2
production seemed to be membrane-bound vascular NADH
and NADPH oxidases. The alteration of vascular relaxations
to endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide was likely, at least
in part, due to the increase in vascular ?O2
2 production, as it
was partially corrected by augmenting vascular superoxide lev￾els with liposome-entrapped superoxide dismutase. In contrast
to the effect of angiotensin II infusion, NE infusion, which pro￾duced a similar degree of hypertension, did not increase vascu￾lar ?O2
2 production and did not alter endothelium-dependent
vascular relaxation.
During the past 2 yr, it has become evident that the
NADH/NADPH oxidases represent the most important
source of ?O2
2 in both endothelial cells and vascular smooth
muscle (18–21). Recent observations by Griendling et al. re￾veal that angiotensin II activates an NADH/NADPH oxidase
in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose- and time￾dependent fashion (13). The present studies add to these re￾cent observations by demonstrating that angiotensin II can ex￾ert this effect in vivo, and that this increase in ?O2
2 production
may contribute to alterations in endothelium-dependent vas￾cular relaxation and responses to exogenous nitrovasodilators
in the intact vessel.
The oxidase activated by angiotensin II in vivo was mem￾brane bound and was activated by NADH to a greater extent
than NADPH. These features are virtually identical to those
previously observed in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells
(13). In intact vascular segments, neither oxypurinol, rotenone,
indomethacin, L-NMMA, nor nordihydroguaretic acid af￾fected vascular superoxide production. Likewise, in studies of
vascular homogenates, xanthine, arachidonic acid, and succi￾nate had only minimal effects on the chemiluminescence sig￾nal. These findings excluded an important role for xanthine
oxidase, mitochondrial electron transport, cyclooxygenase,
NO synthase, and lipooxygenase as sources of ?O2
2.
The NADH/NADPH oxidases of vascular tissues have im￾portant differences from those of neutrophils. Vascular oxi￾dases produce continuous low levels (nmol?min21mg pro￾tein21
) of superoxide in contrast to the “burst”-like high
activity (mmol?min21
?mg protein21
) of neutrophils. The sub￾strate utilization for the neutrophil favors NADPH, while that
of the vascular cell favors NADH (this study and references
13, 19, 21, 22). The vascular oxidase, in spite of all the apparent
differences from the neutrophil/macrophage NADPH oxidase,
may use some of the same components as the neutrophil oxi￾dase. In particular, the vascular smooth muscle–derived
NADH oxidase contains a spectrally detectable cytochrome
b558, similar to the electron transport component of the neutro￾phil NADPH oxidase. Recently, we have cloned an abun￾dantly expressed p22 phox protein from vascular smooth mus￾cle which has a . 90% homology to the neutrophil p22 phox
(the small subunit of cytochrome b558) (17). Identification of
the remaining oxidase components remains to be made.
Removal of the endothelium reduced vascular superoxide
production to an equal extent in vessels from sham-operated
and angiotensin II–treated animals. This finding suggests that
the majority of the increase in vascular ?O2
2 production in an￾giotensin II–treated rats was from vascular smooth muscle. It
is possible that other cell types such as monocyte/macrophages
or neutrophils contributed to the increase in vascular superox￾ide production during angiotensin II infusion, but we believe
this is unlikely. Previous studies have shown that the degree of
inflammatory cell infiltration at these earlier time points of an￾giotensin II infusion is negligible (23). Further, the preferred
substrate for oxidases in macrophages and neutrophils is
NADPH rather than NADH.
The mechanisms and signaling processes whereby angio￾tensin II might increase vascular ?O2
2 production via NADH/
NADPH oxidases remain poorly defined. It is of interest that
these are not shared by another vasoconstrictor, NE. In intact

Angiotensin II and Vascular Oxidases 1921
resistance vessels, membrane-associated diacylglycerol kinase
activity is increased by NE, but not by angiotensin II (24). This
would result in a greater proportion of diacylglycerol formed
on NE stimulation, being reincorporated into phospholipids.
In contrast, in the absence of such activation, the diacylglyc￾erol formed upon angiotensin II stimulation would more likely
lead to the formation of arachidonic acid, through the diacyl￾glycerol lipase pathway. Arachidonic acid has been shown to
activate NADH/NADPH oxidases in both neutrophils and in
vascular smooth muscle cells (13, 25, 26). It has also been re￾cently shown that the AT1
 receptor is closely associated with
Jak2, and that the activity of Jak2 is increased upon angio￾tensin II stimulation of the receptor (27). It is unknown if simi￾lar signaling processes are shared by NE or if Jak2 activation is
involved in stimulation of oxidase activity. This issue is further
compounded by the finding that arachidonic acid had no effect
on oxidase activity of vascular homogenates (unlike what is
observed for homogenates of cultured vascular smooth muscle
cells). It is conceivable that smooth muscle cells in vivo, ex￾posed to a variety of external stimuli, have near-maximally
stimulated oxidase activity, and that the addition of exogenous
arachidonic acid to homogenates of the tissue will have little
further effect. Signaling mechanisms and metabolic pathways
for arachidonic acid may also vary between cells in culture and
in vivo.
Several pathophysiological conditions have been associ￾ated with increases in vascular ?O2
2 production, including hy￾percholesterolemia (14), diabetes (28, 29), ischemia followed

Effect of liposome-encapsulated superoxide dismutase on relaxations to acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore A23187, and nitroglyc￾erin in vessels from sham-operated and angiotensin II–infused rats. Vessels from both groups were exposed for 30–45 min to either empty lipo￾somes (EL) or liposomal-encapsulated superoxide dismutase (SOD, 750 U/ml). Vascular relaxations were examined after contraction with phe￾nylephrine. *P , 0.05 vs sham for percent maximal relaxation; †P , 0.05 vs sham for ED50.

by reperfusion (30), and nitrate tolerance (16). In several of
these, this increase in vascular ?O2
2 has been suggested to alter
endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation by promoting in￾activation of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has been suggested to
have antiatherogenic properties, in terms of inhibiting platelet
aggregation (31), adhesion molecule expression (32), and
smooth muscle proliferation (33). The reaction rate between
?O2
2 and nitric oxide is extremely rapid (6.7 3 109
 mol/sec),
and actually exceeds the reaction rate between superoxide and
superoxide dismutase (34). For this reason, the balance be￾tween ?O2
2, nitric oxide, and superoxide dismutase in the ves￾sel wall is tenuous, and relatively minor changes in the levels of
any of these factors may substantially alter regulation of vascu￾lar tone. Thus, conditions in which steady state ?O2
2 levels are
increased two- to threefold, are associated with rather dra￾matic impairments in endothelium-dependent vascular relax￾ation.
Our findings may provide some insight into why forms of
hypertension associated with elevated plasma renin activity
(and presumably elevated effects of angiotensin II) are associ￾ated with increased cardiovascular event rates (35). It is of in￾terest that hypertension induced by NE infusion was not asso￾ciated with an increase in vascular ?O2
2 production, and did
not alter endothelial regulation of vasomotion. Likewise, infu￾sion of lower doses of angiotensin II, which had minimal ef￾fects on blood pressure, doubled NADH-oxidase activity.
These findings are compatible with the concept that hyperten￾sion per se is not a stimulus for increased ?O2
2 production, and
that conditions in which circulating or local levels of angio￾tensin II are elevated may have unique effects on the vessel
wall, independent of elevating blood pressure. Further, hyper￾tension not associated with increases in angiotensin II, or acti￾vation of vascular oxidases, may be less prone to produce vas￾cular disease.
The effect of hypertension on endothelium-dependent vas￾cular relaxation has been somewhat controversial (for review
see reference 36). Further, the cause of altered endothelial reg￾ulation of vasomotion in various forms of hypertension may
vary. Based on our current findings, it is interesting to specu￾late that animal models or human subjects with hypertension
associated with elevated levels of angiotensin II, might exhibit
greater alterations of endothelium-dependent vascular relax￾ation than do hypertensive conditions associated with low re￾nin/angiotensin II states. Future studies in which endothelium￾dependent vascular relaxation is examined in humans should
take into account the renin/angiotensin II profiles of the sub￾jects examined. Finally, these studies may provide insights into
why treatment with angiotensin II–converting enzyme inhibi￾tors or angiotensin II–receptor antagonists may have benefi￾cial effects not encountered with other drugs (37–40).
