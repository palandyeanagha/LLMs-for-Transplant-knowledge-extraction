Abstract
We analyzed the transcriptional signatures of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages at different times after infection
with promastigotes of the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the macrophage
metabolic pathways including carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms were among the most altered pathways at later time
points of infection. Indeed, L. major promastiogtes induced increased mRNA levels of the glucose transporter and almost all
of the genes associated with glycolysis and lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting a shift to anaerobic glycolysis. On the other
hand, L. major promastigotes enhanced the expression of scavenger receptors involved in the uptake of Low-Density
Lipoprotein (LDL), inhibited the expression of genes coding for proteins regulating cholesterol efflux, and induced the
synthesis of triacylglycerides. These data suggested that Leishmania infection disturbs cholesterol and triglycerides
homeostasis and may lead to cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. Using Filipin and Bodipy staining, we
showed cholesterol and triglycerides accumulation in infected macrophages. Moreover, Bodipy-positive lipid droplets
accumulated in close proximity to parasitophorous vacuoles, suggesting that intracellular L. major may take advantage of
these organelles as high-energy substrate sources. While the effect of infection on cholesterol accumulation and lipid
droplet formation was independent on parasite development, our data indicate that anaerobic glycolysis is actively induced
by L. major during the establishment of infection.

Introduction
Leishmania, the causative agent of vector-borne diseases, known
as leishmaniases, lives as an obligate intracellular parasite within
mammalian hosts. The outcome of infection depends largely on
the activation status of macrophages, the first line of mammalian
defense and the major target cells for parasite replication.
Understanding the strategies developed by the parasite to
circumvent the macrophage defense mechanisms and to survive
within these cells may help defining novel therapeutic approaches
for leishmaniases. High-throughput techniques have allowed the
simultaneous identification and analysis of thousands of genes or
proteins modulated in response to host-pathogen interaction.
Different previous studies have used microarray technology to
investigate the responses of macrophages from human and mouse
origins to Leishmania infection [1], [2], [3], [4]. Most of these
studies have dealt essentially with established infection, and limited
responses to various species of Leishmania were observed. To obtain
a dynamic and informative picture of macrophage behaviour in
response to Leishmania promastigotes, we investigated the mouse
macrophage response to initial invasion of L. major over a time
course that extended from one to 24 hours post-infection. As
controls, we used heat-killed promastigotes infected macrophages
to determine the genes and pathways actively regulated by
Leishmania parasites. Transcripts significantly modulated by Leish￾mania infection over time were identified and a subset of these
genes confirmed by reverse- transcription quantitative real-time
PCR (RT-qPCR). Hierarchical Clustering was performed to
identify gross gene expression features and Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) was used to flag the mouse biological pathways,
networks, and functions significantly altered by Leishmania infection
during the first 24 hours post-infection.
Analysis of the microarray data presented here revealed that in
addition to oxidative stress, immune responses, and inflammatory
genes that have been widely described in previous works, the lipids
and carbohydrates metabolic pathways are among the most

relevant biological networks fitting our data set, modulated by L.
major infection. Among those, anaerobic glycolysis was identified as
one of the major pathway actively regulated by the parasite.
Materials and Methods
Parasites
Promastigotes of the L. major tunisian strain GLC94 (MHOM/
TN/95/GLC94 zymodeme MON25) were grown at 26uC in
RPMI 1640, supplemented with 5 mM L-glutamine, 10% heat
inactivated foetal calf serum (Perbio science, Brebie`res, France),
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Metacyclic
rich fraction obtained using Ficoll gradient was used in all
experiments. Briefly, stationary phase cultures of Leishmania were
centrifuged at 5 000 g for 10 min at room temperature and
resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. The cell suspensions were then
loaded onto a Ficoll gradient composed, from the bottom of 2 ml
of 20%, 5 ml of 10% and 5 ml of 5% Ficoll diluted in PBS. The
gradient was next centrifuged at 1 300 g for 10 min at room
temperature. The metacyclic promastigotes were recovered on the
top of 10% Ficoll layer.
Cells isolation and culture
BALB/c mice (Elevage Janvier) were killed and hind legs
removed for bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)
isolation. Briefly, femurs and tibias were flushed with RPMI
1640 using a 25-gauge needle. Contaminating erythrocytes were
lysed through the addition of Gey lysis solution (ammonium
chloride 1.5M, EDTA 0.1 mM, pH 7.3). All cells were incubated
in T75 culture flasks at 1.5 106 cell per ml in RPMI 1640 media
supplemented with 5 mM L-glutamine, 10% heat inactivated
foetal calf serum, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/
ml) and 80 ng/ml M-CSF (Peprotech, Neuilly sur Seine, France)
overnight for stromal cell elimination. Non-adherent, immature
macrophages were transferred to fresh culture-treated Petri dishes
(Nunc, USA) and grown for 7 days, with re-feeding on day 3, to
induce macrophage differentiation. Generated macrophages were
assessed by flow cytometry for expression of F4/80 (around 90%
were positive).
Ethics statement
All mouse work was done according to the directive 86/609/
EEC of the European parliament and of the council on the
protection of animals used for scientific purposes. Approval for mice
experiments was obtained from the ethic committee of Institute
Pasteur of Tunis with ethics approval number 1204.
Cells infection
BMdM were incubated at a parasite to cell ratio of approxi￾mately 10:1 with Ficoll purified metacyclic promastigotes of L.
major. After the desired time of incubation at 37uC in 5% CO2,
non-ingested parasites were removed and the cells were harvested
to prepare samples. Standard Giemsa staining was used to
determine the percentage of infected cells and to insure for
homogenate cell infection under the different conditions.
RNA isolation, microarray hybridization and analysis
Macrophages were lysed directly in 1 ml Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). Total RNA from uninfected and infected macro￾phages were prepared using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and
treated with DNase according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Extracted RNAs were stored at 280uC. RNAs were quantified
using NanoDrop ND-1000 micro-spectrophotometer and RNA
quality was monitored on Agilent RNA Pico LabChips (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). 100 ng of RNA from each
biological condition were amplified and labelled with biotin
according to the GeneChip whole transcript sense target labeling
assay manual and using the GeneChip WT cDNA Synthesis and
amplification Kit and WT terminal labeling Kit. The fragmented
ssDNA was checked on Agilent RNA Pico LabChips. The
fragmented and labeled ssDNA was hybridized to the GeneChip
Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), washed
with the Fluidics station 450 and scanned using the Affymetrix
Scanner 30007G. QC analysis was performed before and after
normalization using BoxPlot of total intensities, MAPlots for all
replicates and PCAplots. All microarrays of this study passed the
quality control.
Cell intensity files were generated with GeneChipOperating
Software (GCOS). Each infection and control time points were
performed on three different samples, using different preparations
of BMdMs, and processed independently to give three biological
replicates.
Normalization
The data preprocessing step included intrachip and interchip
normalisation and summarisation. The intrachip normalisation
step corrects for the GC content of the probes, the interchip
normalisation step reduces non-biological differences between
chips and the summarisation step combines the probe intensities
into single gene expression values.
The data from BALB/c mouse are different to classical 39-type
Affymetrix chips as mismatch probe sets are not available. Since
the annotation of the new ‘‘exon-like’’ mouse Affymetrix chip
(Affymetrix/MoGene-1_0-st-v1) was not present in all databases,
IDs had to be re-mapped on their Ensembl gene. The process is
implemented completely in R (Version R-2.7.0) with the use of
several BioConductor (BioC 2.2) packages [5].
Probe sets are defined each by one Entrez gene. If the probe
sequence matches uniquely to the gene and no SNP hits the probe
segment of the DNA the probe is assigned to the Entrez gene. We
used a probe-Entrez gene assignment from version 11.0.0 of Dai et
al. [6]. (Entrez database was downloaded for human from
11.03.2008 and for mouse from 28.06.2008). After summarisation
Author Summary
Leishmania are obligated intracellular pathogens that
develop almost exclusively in macrophages. Experimental
leishmaniasis in mice is one of the most extensively
studied models of intracellular infections both at the level
of the parasite and host immune responses. We took
advantage of Balb/c mice model to investigate gene
expression profile through Affymetrix oligonucleotide
arrays. In order to have a general and dynamic picture of
the complex biological events that are acting in the
context of Leishmania intracellular parasitism, we investi￾gated the mouse macrophage response to initial invasion
of L. major over a time course that extended from one to
24 hours post-infection. Our results reveal the alteration of
several biological processes and metabolic changes.
Indeed, similarly to different other pathogens, Leishmania
induces cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation
that have been confirmed by confocal microscopy
experiments. Whether Leishmania parasites take advan￾tage of this high-energy source is now under investigation.
Our findings provided further understandings in host
responses to Leishmania infection.

the Entrez identifer were directly mapped to Ensembl gene. For
this mapping BioMart/EnsMart was used via the biomaRt
package [7–9] in Ensembl v50. The processing relies on Ensembl
genes and it is straightforward to use a probe-Ensembl gene
assignment. At the time of processing, no assignment for HuGene
and MoGene arrays to Ensembl genes was available from [6].
For the intrachip normalisation the ‘Model-based Analysis of
Tiling-arrays’ (MAT) was implemented, similar to [10], since this
method provides the most advanced GC correction for whole￾transcript prepared samples. MAT is a probe affinity model which
combines content and position dependency of probe sequences in
a unified linear model. The parameters of the model are estimated
from the control probes and subsequently the probe affinities are
calculated for the perfect matches. On linear intensity scale, the
probe intensities are divided by an estimated probe affinity. As a
second step, we applied an interchip normalisation in form of a
quantile normalisation to adjust the intensity distributions over the
arrays, as this kind of normalisation appeared successful to reduce
unwanted effects between 39 expression arrays [11]. As a last step
in the preprocessing of the data we applied a summarisation of
probe intensities to a probe set expression. In this process, a
median is computed over the intensities in two replicate
dimensions: a) The different probe intensities within the probe
set; b) The arrays with the same biological condition. This
provides very robust summarised expression values also for low￾replicate settings.
Detection call p-values were computed for each probeset with a
paired Wilcoxon signed rank test that compares probe intensity to
control probes of similar GC content. More precisely, each probe
is compared to the 75% quantile of the set of control probes with
similar GC content. A gene probeset was called present when the
corresponding FDR corrected p-value was below 5%. The sole
threshold in this approach is the height of the quantile (75%) in the
GC bin. The same probe-Entrez gene assignment and subsequent
mapping was used as in the summarisation process.
Expression analysis used the R Bioconductor package Limma to
identify genes that met statistical (P,0.05 after adjustment
according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg and fold￾change criteria (at least a 1.5-fold change) for differential
expression using the following contrasts: macrophages infected
with live parasites at a given time point versus non infected
macrophages incubated with vehicule (media) for the same time.
The same contrast was used for heat-killed Leishmania-infected
macrophages. Macrophage genes modulated during the kinetics
were first detected.
In accordance with MIAME (Minimum Information About a
Microarray Experiments) regulations, all data were deposited into
GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/ under the accession number GSE31995.
Ingenuity global functional analysis
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity, CA; Systems
2008) is derived from known functions and interactions of genes
published in the literature as well a set of canonical pathways and
cellular Toxic molecules markers in the context of several studied
diseases.
The Ingenuity IPA Tool was used to identify the most
significant macrophagic biological networks, cellular functions
and canonical pathways altered by Leishmania parasite infection,
based on a Fischer’s exact test to calculate a p-value for each
biological function founded (at least P,0.01).
A list of the statistically significant differential genes expression
in L. major-infected BALB/c macrophage for each time points of
the kinetic was generated and mapped to their functional networks
in the IPA database and ranked by score. The relationships
between the generated networks and known pathways were then
investigated using the canonical pathway analysis function. In
addition, we applied 2 IPA analysis methods: an analysis of dataset
corresponding to each time point of infection and a global analysis
along the kinetic of infection that allowed us to identify the Top
canonical and cellular pathways altered across all time points of
the infection.
dchip clustering
The Affymetrix 1.07 array data were analyzed using dChip
software (http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/,cli/dchip_2010_01.
exe) in order to identify the marker genes cluters regulated later
or earlier throughout the kinetic of Leishmania infection. Moreover,
the dchip software was used to check the signature of live Leismania
major parasite infection comparing with the Killed parasite one.
Quantitative real time PCR
RNA quantity, was controlled using NanoDrop ND-1000
micro-spectrophotometer and RNA quality and integrity (RNA
Integrity Number, RIN.9) was monitored on Agilent RNA Pico
LabChips (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Reverse
transcriptions were performed for each of 96 mice samples in
20 ml final reaction volume with 273 ng of total RNA using 200
Units of SuperScript III enzyme (M-MLV RT, Invitrogen) and
250 ng of random primers according to manufacturer’s instruc￾tions (25uC 10 min, 42uC 50 min, 70uC 15 min). All RT
reactions were performed the same day with same pipetor set
and same manipulator. A negative control was included by
performing a RT with no template. qPCR experiments were
carried out using EVA Green chemistry on BioMark qPCR
apparatus (Fluidigm) following manufacturer’s instructions. For
each cDNA sample, a Specific Target Amplifications (STA) was
performed with a pool of primers targeting all selected genes (Pre￾Amplification of 14 cycles using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and following manufacturer’s instructions):
Each qPCR was performed with 1/20 STA dilution, in duplicate.
Relative gene expression kinetics was created by a first
normalization with 4 reference genes followed by a second
normalization with Non Infected macrophage cells (NI). Values
are expressed in fold changes (22Delta Delta Ct Method) [12]
compared to NI macrophage cells.
Western blot analysis
Cells extracts were obtained by adding 25 ml of lysis buffer
containing 10 mM Tris-HCL pH 7,5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM
sodium fluoride (NaF), 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(b￾aminoethyl ether)-N.N;N9.N9-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 2% Non￾idet-P40 (NP-40), 0,75% sodium deoxycholate (DOC), 1 mM
orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml aprotinine, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT.
After 30 min incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at
15000 rpm for 20 min. 25 mg of whole cell lysates were resolved
by electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Resolved
proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF sheets
(Hybond-P; Amersham) and membranes were blocked by
incubation in 3% non-fat milk and 0,1%Tween in PBS for 1 h
at room temperature followed by incubation with COX-2
antibody (BD Biosciences, France) in 0,1% tween-PBS. Bound
antibody was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase￾coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.,
Buckinghamshire, U.K.). To ensure for equal loading, the blots
were then stripped (62.5 mM Tris (pH 6,8), 0,1M b-mercapto￾ethanol, 2%SDS) and re-probed with ERK1/2, antibody.

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
All incubations and washes were done in 16PBS. Macrophages
were fixed in 4% paraformaldhehyde for 10 min at room
temperature.
For Lipid Droplet Staining, Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes)
was used as previously described with some modifications [13].
Briefly, cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature using a
solution of Bodipy and DRAQ5 (Biostatus, Leicestershire, UK)
that allows the staining of macrophage and parasite nuclei. All
coverslips were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern
Biotechnology Associates).
Otherwise, for free cholesterol accumulation, Filipin staining
was used as previously described with some modifications [14],
[15]. Coverslips were incubated in Glycine to quench parafor￾maldehyde and cells were then stained with Filipin and DRAQ5
for 2 h at room temperature. All coverslips were washed and
mounted on slides with Fluoromount- G.
Detailed analysis of lipid droplet accumulation was performed
using an oil immersion Nikon Plan Apo 100 (N.A. 1.4) objective
mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a
Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad, Zeiss).
Analysis of Filipin staining was visualized with the Eclipse TE
2000-U epifluorescence microscope equipped with Lambda DG-4
illumination. Intensity differences in Filipin staining were quan￾tified using linescan analysis (Metamorph software).
Results
To investigate the temporal response of macrophages following
infection with L. major promastigotes, a time course was performed
during which RNA was extracted from BMdM infected for 1, 3, 6,
12, and 24 h with live or heat-inactivated promastigotes.
GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used to analyse global
changes in gene transcripts to generate a pool of genes that was
statistically significant (p-value,0.05) and a fold change cut-off of
1.5 in at least one of the five infected samples versus non-infected
samples. Of the 18 899 genes represented on the array, our
analysis of mRNA expression in mouse BMdM infected by live
parasites showed that a total of 782 genes were expressed
differentially over the time course while only 375 genes were
differentially modulated by macrophages infected by heat-inacti￾vated promastigotes. The relative expression of 83 selected
differentially expressed genes from the microarray data was
further examined by RT-qPCR on the same samples that those
analyzed by microarray analysis. The data from RT-qPCR
analysis (Table S3) is consistent with the results obtained by
microarrays, albeit with magnitudes different from, and often
higher than, those recorded by the microarray analysis.
Clustering between the control (non-infected) and the group of
the 782 genes (modulated by live parasites) was carried out and
shows that these genes can be grouped into five different clusters
(Figure 1). Cluster 1, contained a set of down-regulated genes
while cluster 3 included a set of genes up-regulated across time
course of experiment. Cluster 4 contained genes up-regulated
during the first hours of infection while cluster 5 included genes
up-regulated late during the infection. Several of those genes have
been pinpointed by others and reported to be modulated by
different Leishmania species [1], [2], [4]. These included different
genes coding for chemokines and chemokines receptors such as
CCL4 and CCR2, cytokines such as IL-1b, transcription factors
such as c-fos and NF-kB, and receptors such as TLR2. Further
analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems,
Redwood City, CA; http://www.ingenuity.com) (IPA) of these
differentially expressed genes revealed that besides the induction of
transcriptional responses to oxidative stress, immune responses,
and inflammation, canonical metabolic pathways are among the
most relevant biological networks fitting our data sets that were
modulated by L. major infection (Figure 2 and Table S1).
Immune response and inflammation
Our data show that the transcription of different cytokines and
chemokines involved in the inflammatory response and cellular
recruitment to the site of inflammation was significantly altered.
Indeed, transcription of CXCL1 (up to 3 fold increase), CXCL2
(up to 3.9 fold) and CXCL3 (up to 2 fold) (alias respectively
GROa, GROb, GROc) was rapidly induced and persisted
during the first 12 hours of infection. Consistent with previous
studies [2], [16] and associated with the classical activation M1
phenotype, transcription of TNFa (up to 5), CXCL10 (IP10),
CCL2 (MIP1a), and other chemotactic cytokines such as CCL3
(up to 6.8) and CCL4 was upregulated following infection. By
contrast, transcription of CCR2, the CCL2 receptor, was down￾regulated while the mRNA expression of CCRL2 was strongly
up-regulated. Leishmania infection also led to mRNA downregu￾lation of other cytokines such as IL-1b. Moreover, M2
polarization-associated anti-inflammatory cytokines including
IL-1Ra, and receptors such as CD36 were up-regulated in
Figure 1. Hierarchical clustering of genes differentially ex￾pressed in Leishmania major infected BALB/c macrophages. Five
distinct clusters were identified by hierarchical clustering analysis using
dChip software. Two clusters represent genes that were significantly
down-regulated (cluster 1) and up-regulated (cluster 3) over the time
course. The second (cluster 2), contains genes that start to be up￾regulated from 6 to 24 hours after infection Two other clusters contain
genes up-regulated during the early hours (1,3 and 6 hrs) of infection
(cluster 4) and at 6, 12 and 24 hrs (cluster 5). Each row represents a spot
on the microarray and each column a separate microarray. BMdM
response was studied at five different time points (from the left to the
right: P-T1h, P-T3h, P-T6h, P-T12h and P-T24h). The left-hand column
show non-infected cells (NI) that were used as internal control.

infected cells. Finally, transcription of both NOS2 (which
characterizes M1 macrophage phenotype) (up to 5 fold) and
arginase1 (ARG1) (which characterize M2 macrophage pheno￾type) (up to 4 fold) was increased in response to L. major
promastigotes at different time points. Importantly, both NOS2
and ARG1 were actively induced by live parasite. Indeed, as
assessed by qPCR, both genes were not transcribed in heat-killed
promastigote-infected cells (data not shown). Infection also
induced the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such CD40,
CD83, CD86, adhesion molecules (CD38, Itga5, and ICAM1),
and tissue invasion molecules such as MMP12 and MMP14.
Energy, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism
Among the most relevant pathways modulated by L. major
infection, we found different metabolic pathways (Figure 2)
including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic cycle, oxidative
phosphorylation and pentose phosphate shunt.
Leishmania infection induces activation of glycolysis and
inhibition of Tricarboxylic cycle (TCA) and oxidative
phosphorylation. Starting from 3 hours post-infection, almost
all the genes encoding host glycolytic enzymes (Figure 3) displayed
significant increased expression. This up-regulation concerned the
glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi) (up to 2.5 fold), the fructose￾biphosphate aldolase (Aldoa,c) (2 fold), the triose phosphate
isomerase 1 (Tpi) (3.6 fold), the glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (2.9 fold), and the enolase 2 (Eno2) (more than 3
fold). Moreover, transcription of the genes encoding the three
enzymes that control the rate of glycolysis (the hexokinases (Hk1,
2, 3), the phosphofructokinase (PFK) (2.3 fold), and the pyruvate
kinase (Pkm2) (2 fold) was significantly enhanced. On the other
hand, transcription of the gene encoding the 6-phosphofructo-2-
kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), responsible for
fructose-2,6 biphosphate generation (the powerful allosteric
regulator of PFK) and thus a glycolysis promoting enzyme, was
significantly increased.
Leishmania infection also induced transcription of genes impli￾cated in the starch degradation pathway. Indeed, the genes
encoding the 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme (Gbe1), the
hexokinases (Hk1, Hk2 and Hk3), and the phosphoglucomutases
(pgm2 and pgm5) implicated respectively in the fructose-6 and
glucose-6 isomerisation, were up-regulated throughout the time
course, and this may lead to the feeding of glycolysis. Finally,
infection resulted in a robust and sustained increase of the glucose
transporter (Slc2a1) mRNA levels (more than 9 fold). Taken
together these data suggest that infection with L. major promas￾tigotes induces an enhanced uptake of glucose and an increased
rate of glycolysis.
Pyruvate generated by glycolysis may be further metabolized to
acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or to lactate
by the activation of lactate dehydrogenase (Figure 3). While the
microarray data showed that expression of the pyruvate dehydro￾genase (Pdh) complex genes was not significantly changed, the
data obtained by qPCR showed a downregulation of Pdha1
expression during the first 12 hours post infection (hpi). By
contrast, starting from 3 hpi, Leishmania induced the up-regulation
of the gene encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
isoenzyme 1 (Pdk1), known to inactivate pyruvate dehydrogenase.
In parallel, a sustained activation of the lactate dehydrogenase-A
transcription was detected by microarray and confirmed by qPCR
data. Taken together, these results suggest that Leishmania
stimulates the catabolism of carbohydrates and induces the host
cells to shift to anaerobic glycolysis.
Besides the up-regulation of genes involved in anaerobic
glycolysis, the microarray data showed that among the genes
encoding components of the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle,
transcription of three enzymes-encoding genes, the isocitrate
dehydrogenase (Idh1), the succinate dehydrogenase (Sdhb) and the
fumarate hydratase (Fh1), was downregulated during infection
(Figure 3). Real time qPCR confirmed these findings and showed
that besides these three genes, the transcription of two other key

enzymes, the citrate synthase like (Csl) and the pyruvate
carboxylase (Pcx), was down-regulated throughout the infection
time course (Table S3).
The expression of twenty five genes involved in mitochondrial
respiration was detected by Affymetrix hybridization (Table S2
and S3) and showed a coordinated down-regulation starting from
12 hpi (Table S2). Indeed, the expression of nine genes coding for
Complex I (NADH-UQ-dehydrogenase) subunits decreased by up
to 2 fold starting from 12 hpi. Moreover, the qPCR data showed
that the mRNA expression of Ndufs4 protein subunits involved in
the regulation of Complex I activity was down-regulated at all time
points (Table S3). RT-qPCR data also showed that transcription
of Sdha and Sdhb genes, coding for respectively the a and b
subunits of the Complex II (Succinate UQ dehydrogenase), was
down-regulated over the infection time course (Table S3).
Moreover, the transcriptional expression of three genes, Uqcrfs1,
Uqcrh and Uqcr10, which are involved in the Complex III
(cytochrome b/c1 oxidoreductase) activity and structure, de￾creased slightly starting from 6 hpi. Though modest, this decrease
was consistent across several time points. On the other hand, the
expression of five genes (Cox17, Cox5a, Cox6a1, Cox6b1, Cox4i1,
Cox7a2l) part of the Complex IV (Cytochrome C oxidase), was
also down-regulated starting from 12 hpi (Tables S2 and S3).
Finally, transcription of two subunits (Atp5e, Atp5g3) of the
complex V (ATP-synthase), which couples the proton gradient
generated by the respiratory chain to ATP synthesis, decreased
starting from 12 hpi (Tables S2 and S3). Taken together, these
results show a coordinated transcriptional decrease of an
important number of the genes involved in the TCA cycle and
the oxidative phosphorylation.
Leishmania infection modulates the lipid pathway by
inducing cholesterol accumulation and triglycerides
synthesis. Macrophage cholesterol content is essentially a
balance between cholesterol intake and/or biosynthesis and
cholesterol efflux. Microarray data showed that transcription of
two genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, HMG-CoA
reductase and squalene epoxidase was increased by infection. A
significant increase in the genes encoding different receptors
implicated in the uptake of LDL was also observed. These include
CD36 and the LDL receptor related protein, the low-density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 12 precursors (Lrp12). Infec￾tion also led to the expression of a variety of genes encoding
secreted lipases such as the Lipoprotein lipase precursor (lpl) (1.7
fold) that preferentially hydrolyzes triglycerides. Finally, we
observed a down-regulation of the genes encoding both the
ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (almost 2 fold),
which mediates the active efflux of cellular cholesterol and
phospholipids, and the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) (2.7 fold)
that plays an important role in oxysterol generation and thus in the
prevention of cholesterol accumulation. Taken together, the
transcriptomic data suggests an enhanced cholesterol uptake
coupled with a decreased cholesterol efflux, raising the possibility

that cholesterol accumulates within L. major-infected cells. To
address this issue, macrophages were incubated with vehicule or
infected with Leishmania promastigotes for the indicated period of
time, fixed, and labeled with Filipin. Our data show that an
intracellular Filipin labeling was detectable as early as one hpi.
Progressively, the staining in the cytosol was enhanced and
sustained for up to 24 hpi (Figure 4).
Leishmania infection also modulates the transcription of genes
implicated in lipid metabolism. Indeed, expression of the genes
encoding the stearoyl-CoA desaturases 2 (Scd), that catalyzes the
conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA and thereby regulates
the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids was
enhanced following L. major infection (up to 2.9) (Table S2). In
addition to this important enzyme in the biosynthesis of fatty acids
(FA), the mRNA levels for two other enzymes, the long chain fatty
acid CoA ligase (Acsl1) (up to 2.47) (responsible for associating
long-chain free fatty acids with coenzyme A) and the Fatty acid–
binding protein 4 (FABP4) (up to 3.2), (that binds long-chain fatty
acids and controls the cellular localisation of FAs) showed a
sustained increase. Finally, transcription of the genes encoding
three enzymes, namely the 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyl￾transferase 5 (Agapt5) that catalyses the formation of phosphatidic
acid, the lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 3 (Ppap2b), and the
Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2), that catalyzes the
conversion of diacylglycerol to triglycerides, was significantly
enhanced in infected cells. As the formation of lipid droplets (LD)
is highly linked to the biosynthesis of triglycerides, we investigated
the role of infection on triglyceride accumulation and lipid-droplet
formation in Leishmania infected BMdM. Using the fluorescent
neutral lipid dye Bodipy, we observed a rapid (1 hour) accumu￾lation of LD in L. major-infected cells (Figure 5A). This
accumulation did not occur randomly, since in most cases,
Bodipy-positives LD were present in close association with the
parasitophorous vacuole (Figure 5B).
Expression of the gene encoding the cytosolic phospholipase A2
(cPLA2) was slightly upregulated (1.7 fold) while expression of the
genes encoding the Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (COX-2) (up to
5.5) and the Prostaglandin E synthase displayed an important and
sustained increase in response to L. major infection. By contrast, the
gene encoding the Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 (COX-1) was
downregulated by more than two fold at 6 and 12 hpi. These
findings suggest that Leishmania induces the biosynthetic pathway
of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade which involves the release of
polyunsaturated fatty acids catalysed by the phosholipase A2
(PLA2) and its subsequent metabolism to bioactive prostaglandins
(PGs) by cyclooxygenases. To investigate whether COX-2 mRNA
expression correlated with protein synthesis, the protein levels of
COX-2 were assessed in RAW 264.7 macrophages infected for
12 h and 24 h. LPS (100 ng/ml) was used as positive control.
Figure 6 shows that, while LPS induced COX-2 expression, L.
major promastigotes did not induce changes in the levels of COX￾2.
Transcriptional profile induced by killed parasites. In
an attempt to highlight the cellular pathways actively regulated by
the parasite, we used heat-inactivated L. major promastigotes as
control. Compared to live promastigotes, killed parasites induced
the expression of fewer genes. Only 375 genes were differentially
expressed when macrophages internalized killed parasites. Of
those, 241 genes were induced in both live and killed promasti￾gote-infected BMdM. These include immune response genes such
as chemokines, oxidative stress, but also metabolic pathway genes.
The genes that were differentially regulated upon infection with
Leishmania and which belong to the pathways analyzed upward,
were subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis using DNA Chip

Analyzer (dChip) software (Figure 7A and 7B). This clustering
showed that infection of BMdM with either live or killed
promastigotes resulted in similar transcriptomic profile for the genes
implicated in the immune response and lipid metabolism. This result
supports the hypothesis that the capacity to induce immune
response, cholesterol accumulation and LD formation is indepen￾dent of Leishmania viability. By contrast, internalization of heat￾inactivated promastigotes clearly did not result in the expression of
genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the activation
and the shift to anaerobic glycolysis is actively regulated by the
parasite (Figure 7B). These results have been confirmed by qPCR.
Discussion
To identify host cell pathways modulated by Leishmania, DNA
microarrays were used in several studies to monitor transcriptional
changes in host cells following infection [1], [2], [4], [17]. As
previously reported, we show here that L. major promastigotes
induce the expression of genes encoding chemokines such as MIP￾1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, potent chemotractants for
monocytes/macrophages [2], and inflammatory mediators includ￾ing TNFa, CCL5, CXCL1-3 [1]. We also observed an upregula￾tion of CXCL10 gene expression, a Th1-mobilizing chemokine
shown to be produced by lesion cells from self-healing cutaneous
leishmaniasis (CL)-patients during active leishmaniasis [18], and
the induction of the proinflammatory monocyte chemotractant
protein 1 (MCP-1) encoded by the CCL2 gene, which has been
associated to cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Besides inflammatory mediators, L. major promastigotes also
induced the transcription of genes normally associated to an M2
response such as arginase1. A similar hybrid macrophage
activation profile that does not strictly fall into one of the two
categories (classical and alternative) has been previously observed
in macrophages infected with L. chagasi [3]. This inflammatory
response of infected macrophages is rapidly induced and is likely
triggered by the stimulation of the receptors implicated in the
recognition of Leishmania parasites, as heat-killed promastigotes
displayed similar effect on macrophage mRNA profile.
Once the parasites get into the cells and start to multiply, the
host cells seem to adapt their metabolism to face the infection. The
microarray data indicated that Leishmania infection result in an
enhanced rate of glycolysis but with reduced glucose flux through
tricarboxylic acid cycle. The requirement to regenerate NAD+ to
maintain glycolysis (i.e., conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate) is accomplished by lactate dehydro￾genase (LDH)-catalyzed reduction of pyruvate to lactate. Thus,
infected macrophages would tend to convert glucose into lactate
even in the presence of sufficient oxygen to support mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, the down-regulation of a
number of genes implicated in the TCA cycle and oxidative
phosphorylation suggests that increased glycolysis may be the
mechanism L. major relies on for energy production. Interestingly,
expression of the glycolytic enzymes encoding genes, including
LDH and PDK, was not induced when heat-killed promastigotes
were used to infect BMdM, suggesting that L. major promastigotes
actively induce macrophages to shift their metabolism to anaerobic
glycolysis. Up-regulation of host glycolytic transcripts has been
reported for macrophages infected by Toxoplasma gondii [19] and
was shown to correlate with the activation of the HIF-1a
transcription factor [20]. On the other hand, expression of HIF￾1a has been observed in the cutaneous lesions of L. amazonensis
infected BALB/c mice [21]. Stabilization of HIF1a in response to
Leishmania infection may explain this increasing flux through the
glycolytic pathway, the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and the
suppression of the TCA cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation
observed in infected BMdM. Whether the effect of Leishmania on
this metabolic pathway relies on HIF-1a activation is currently
under investigation.
Almost all the scavenger receptors such as CD36, expressed on
several cell types including macrophages, deliver associated lipids
to lysosomes. Then, essential enzymes for the cleavage of
cholesteryl esters and triglycerides generate free cholesterol and
fatty acids that are next released from lysosomes into the cytosol.
The efflux of excess cholesterol is promoted by different
transporters including the ATP binding cassette (ABC) gene
family. Among those, ABCA1 plays a major role in this process
and decreased expression of this transporter, as found in our
microarray data, could lead to the inhibition of the cholesterol
efflux. Moreover, our data indicate a down-regulation of CYP27
mRNA levels in Leishmania-infected cells, suggesting that infection
results in an alteration of the host cell oxysterol content. Decreased
levels of this natural Liver X Receptor (LXR) endogenous ligand

in infected cells may explain the inhibition of LXR target genes
expression such ABCA1 [22], [23]. Moreover, stearoyl-CoA
desaturase, whose expression was induced by Leishmania, inhibits
ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux [24]. Epifluorescence micros￾copy confirmed the microarray data, indicating that L. major
infection modulates macrophage cholesterol content and induces
its accumulation into the cytoplasm. Cholesterol plays a key role
during the infection process by several intracellular pathogens,
including adhesion and internalization [25], as well as for survival
within host cells as reported for the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma
gondii [26], [27]. In Leishmania-infected cells, cholesterol depletion
[28] or sequestration [29] reduces the extent of infection by
promastigotes. The role of cholesterol accumulation into L. major￾infected cells remains to be defined and whether this accumulation
is induced by other Leishmania species remains to be investigated.
L. major infection also promotes macrophage-derived foam cell
formation. This was suggested by the analysis of microarray data
and was validated by the staining of infected cells with Bodipy that
clearly demonstrated the accumulation of lipids droplets into the
cytoplasm. Interestingly, these lipid droplets are mainly localized
in the proximity of the parasitophorous vacuoles. The induction of
foam macrophages has been observed during infection by different
bacteria such as Mycobacterium, Chlamydia [30] or parasites
including Trypanosoma cruzi [31], Toxoplasma gondii [32], [33], and
Plasmodium falciparum [34]. Moreover, a recent study revealed that
cytoplasmic LDs are translocated across the inclusion membrane
into the lumen of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in Chlamydia
infected cells [35]. A similar mechanism of lipid acquisition by
Leishmania may exist that allows the parasite to take advantage of
this high-energy source. From another point of view, accumulation
of LD may be implicated in the cross-presentation of antigens
derived from PVs containing live parasites. Indeed, accumulation
of lipid bodies has been reported to be required for normal and
efficient cross-presentation of OVA-coated latex beads by
dendritic cells [36]. Interestingly, expression of a member of the
IRG gene family (Irgm3) that has recently been implicated in this
pathway was induced in Leishmania-infected BMdM. Both live and
heat-inactivated Leishmania promastigotes induce the transcription
of the same set of genes involved in the intracellular cholesterol
accumulation and foam cell formation in bone marrow-derived
macrophages suggesting that the development of the parasite is not
required. Accumulation of cholesterol and formation of lipids
bodies may be achieved through the stimulation of different
receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that have been
implicated in the recognition and control of Leishmania parasites
[37], [38], [39]. Indeed, a recent study revealed that TLR
stimulation impairs macrophage cellular cholesterol efflux in vivo
[40]. Moreover, in vitro activation of TLR-3 and TLR-4 by
microbial ligand blocks the induction of LXR target genes
including ABCA1 [41]. Similarly, the formation of lipid bodies
in response to bacteria is dependent on TLR (and particularly
TLR2) signalling [42] and more generally the activation of TLRs
by pathogen-derived agonists promotes lipid accumulation [43],
[44]. TLR may thus provide an important link between lipid
metabolism, infection and the innate immune response.
In inflammatory cells, lipid bodies have been associated to
arachidonic acid metabolism and eicosanoid-forming enzymes
have been localized in lipid bodies that are sites for 5-LO- and
COX-derived eicosanoid synthesis [45]. Moreover, lipid bodies
have been reported as intracellular domains for eicosanoid
synthesis in vivo. Consistent with previous studies [17], [46], we
show here that despite the induction of significant COX-2 mRNA
levels the COX-2 protein was not detected in L. major infected
macrophages. The control of gene expression in eucaryotes is
subjected to dynamic regulation in the cell. This control is a multi￾step process that includes transcription, splicing, translation and
post-translational regulation. We have thus to take in mind that
besides transcription, different other levels of control, may take
place in L. major-infected macrophages and influence the level of
biologically active protein.
Collectively, our results suggest that L. major promastigotes push
the macrophages to shift toward anaerobic glycolysis and induce
the accumulation of cholesterol and the formation of foam cells.
These metabolic changes occurring in host cells appear to be
induced by a large number of pathogens, and are likely to play an
important role in pathogenesis.
