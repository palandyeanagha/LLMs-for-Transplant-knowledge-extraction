Aim: The influence of surgical margin on the prognosis of patients with early solitary
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (≤5 cm) is undetermined.
Methods: The data of 904 patients with early solitary HCC who underwent liver resection
were collected for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Propensity
score matching (PSM) was performed to balance the potential bias.
Results: Log-rank tests showed that 2 mm was the best cutoff value to discriminate
the prognosis of early HCC. Liver resection with a >2 mm surgical margin distance
(wide-margin group) led to better 5-year RFS and OS rate compared with liver resection
with a ≤2 mm surgical margin distance (narrow-margin group) among patients both
before (RFS: 59.1% vs. 39.6%, P < 0.001; OS: 85.3% vs. 73.7%, P < 0.001) and after
PSM (RFS: 56.3% vs. 41.0%, P < 0.001; OS: 83.0% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.010). Subgroup
analysis showed that a wide-margin resection significantly improved the prognosis of
patients with microvascular invasion (RFS: P < 0.001; OS: P = 0.001) and patients
without liver cirrhosis (RFS: P < 0.001; OS: P = 0.001) after PSM. Multivariable Cox
regression analysis revealed that narrow-margin resection is associated with poorer RFS
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.781, P < 0.001), OS (HR = 1.935, P < 0.001], and early recurrence
(HR = 1.925, P < 0.001).
Conclusions: A wide-margin resection resulted in better clinical outcomes than a
narrow-margin resection among patients with early solitary HCC, especially for those with
microvascular invasion and without cirrhosis. An individual strategy of surgical margin
should be formulated preoperation according to both tumor factors and background
liver factors.

Wang et al. Surgical Margin for Early HCC
INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
pathological type of primary liver cancer (1). Solitary HCC
up to 5 cm has been authenticated to be low invasive and
identified as early HCC with excellent long-term outcomes after
curative treatment (2, 3). Although liver resection (LR) of early
HCC can result in approximately 75% 5-year overall survival
(OS) rate, ∼60 to 70% 5-year tumor recurrence rate is still a main
clinical concern (4).
Although many optimal strategies for adjuvant therapy
after LR, such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
(TACE) and antivirus treatment, have been confirmed to
positively facilitate clinical outcomes, the patients’ sufferings,
compliance, and finances would prevent the implementation
of these measures to some extent (5–7). Therefore, it is
still the best way to benefit patients through a one-off
radical resection. Concerning both tumor eradication and liver
volume preservation, precise hepatectomy is necessary. The
parameters reflecting the pathobiological behaviors of tumor
and background liver are the best reference for retrospective
exploration of strategies for individualized surgical treatment (8).
Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a histological feature that
indicates aggressive behavior of HCC (9, 10). The presence of
MVI has been regarded as one of the most essential parameters
reflecting postoperative recurrence and long-term survival, even
in very early-stage HCC (11). A South Korean study showed
that solitary HCCs of 2 to 5 cm without MVI could benefit
from anatomical resection compared with those with MVI (12).
Nevertheless, another study demonstrated anatomical resection
was a significantly favorable factor for the MVI positive patients
who had single nodule HCC <5 cm (13). Interestingly, a recent
study reported that a wide-margin LR improved the long-term
prognosis of hepatitis B–related HCC with MVI, which prompted
that the low residual rate of tumor cells caused by adequately
resection might be the true reason of good prognosis (14).
In addition, liver cirrhosis is one of the most common
inducing factors of hepatocarcinogenesis and also directly
indicates the feasibility of operation (15, 16). With the
development of surgical techniques, some HCC patients with
advanced cirrhosis also could achieve curative LR on the
premise of perioperative safety (17, 18). However, few studies
have explored the impact of surgical margin on the long-term
prognosis of those patients. A multicenter study revealed that
multiple recurrences near the resection margin or at extrahepatic
sites were more frequent in the normal liver HCC patients,
whereas solitary recurrence at a distant site was more common
in the liver cirrhosis HCC patients (19). Considering opposite
significance of different recurrence pattern (20), individual

resection range is worthy of discussion in HCC patients with and
without liver cirrhosis.
Taking the above results into account, we hypothesize that
adequate margin distance may have a positive effect on the
prognosis of early HCC patients and therefore carry out the
current study. Furthermore, subgroup analysis is performed
based on MVI and liver cirrhosis, in order to explore individual
therapeutic strategy aiming at both tumor malignancy and
background liver function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was conducted on patients who underwent LR for
primary solitary HCC up to 5 cm at the Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital (EHBH) in Shanghai, China, between
December 2009 and December 2010. Inclusion criteria
included histologically confirmed HCC, solitary tumor up
to 5 cm, and Child–Pugh A–B. Exclusion criteria included
combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, recurrent HCC,
macroscopic tumor thrombus in major portal/hepatic veins and
bile ducts, extrahepatic metastasis, severe liver dysfunction (such
as massive ascites and hepatic encephalopathy), preoperative
anticancer treatment, and a history of other malignancy. This
study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the
EHBH (no. EHBHKY2015-02-001). Written informed consent
was issued by all the patients before operation for using their
data for the research.
Preoperative Assessment and Pathologic
Diagnosis
Liver function, tumor markers, complete blood count, blood
coagulation function, and hepatitis tests constituted routine
preoperative laboratory examinations. Imaging studies included
chest x-ray, as well as ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of the abdomen. All operations were conducted using
a conventional open approach. Intraoperative ultrasonography
was used routinely to accurately judge the size, number, location
of the lesions, and their relationship to major vascular structures
and to rule out additional unknown lesions. Although a wide
surgical margin was the aim of the hepatic resection, a grossly
negative macroscopic margin without tumor exposure was
authorized adequate.
The sampling protocol was implemented by pathologists
based on the 7-point baseline sampling protocol as previously
reported (21). Three experienced pathologists evaluated all
sections independently. The tumor size was on account of
the largest dimension of the tumor in the resection specimen.
Microvascular invasion was defined as tumors within a vascular
space lined by endothelium that was visible only on microscopy
(22). Liver cirrhosis was defined as at least one pseudolobule
was seen in the liver tissue microscopically. The Edmondson–
Steiner classification was used to determine HCC differentiation
(23). The definition of anatomical resection was based on the
Brisbane 2000 Nomenclature of Liver Anatomy and Resections,
and non-anatomical resection indicated wedge/limited

resection (24). Anatomical resection was defined as the
systematic removal of a hepatic territory confined by tumor￾bearing portal branches, whereas non-anatomical resection
was defined as local resection or enucleation regardless of
Couinaud segments.
Follow-Up
All patients were followed up once every 2 months in the first year
and once every 3 months thereafter. Follow-up investigations
consisted of ultrasonographic scans, CT, or MRI with serum
α-fetoprotein (AFP). The recurrence-free survival (RFS) was
defined as the time from initial treatment to tumor recurrence
or censored. Overall survival was defined as the interval between
treatment and death or the date of the last follow-up visit.
Follow-up data were censored until 60 months.
Relapse was considered as suspicious imaging findings
or a biopsy-confirmed tumor. As the diagnosis of tumor
recurrence was certain, the therapeutic options were decided
according to number of tumors, tumor site, liver function,
and general patient condition. Treatment methods included
surgical re-resection, ablation, TACE, and other selections, such
as liver transplantation, chemotherapy, percutaneous ethanol
injection therapy, radiotherapy, sorafenib, and translational
Chinese medicine.

X-Tile and Best Cut-Off Value of Surgical
Margin
In the previous studies, macroscopic no margin (25), 5 mm (26),
and 1 cm (14) all have been employed as the cutoff values of
surgical margin. However, these values were based more on the
clinical experience, rather than evidence. Considering the high
perioperative safety of early HCC, prognosis is regarded as the
best reference to explore the cutoff value of surgical margin
distance. In our study, X-tile plots were used for assessment of
surgical margin, which was represented as distance value and
optimization of cut-point based on RFS and OS (27). Statistical
significance was assessed using the cutoff score derived from
904 HCC cases by a standard log-rank method, with P-values
obtained from a lookup table. The distance value that obtained
the biggest χ
2
value was employed as the cutoff point that
discriminated “wide-margin” and “narrow-margin” LR.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were described as mean ± standard
deviation. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies
(percentages). Statistical calculation of categorical and
continuous variables was performed using the χ
2
test or
the Fisher exact test and the Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney
U-test, when appropriate. Survival analyses were conducted
utilizing the Kaplan–Meier method, the log-rank test. The Cox
proportional hazards model was used in exploring independent
prognostic factors of RFS and OS. The predictive factors of MVI
were determined using univariable and multivariable logistic
regression models. Variables with P < 0.1 in univariable analysis
of the Cox regression and logistic regression were selected for
screening of the multivariable model.
The influence of confounding factors and selection bias
were reduced by propensity score matching (PSM) (28). All
variables with potential differences (P < 0.2) were entered
into the PSM model. The matching variables included age,
albumin (ALB), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), platelets, prothrombin time (PT), hepatitis
B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) load, Child–
Pugh classification, hepatectomy method, transfusion,
diameter, cirrhosis, capsule, and MVI. Considering the
high correlation between PT and international normalized
ratio, we selected PT in propensity matching. The logistic
regression analysis was performed using the nearest
neighbor matching to estimate the propensity score. The
ratio for matching was established at 1:1 using a caliper
of width equal to 0.05 of the standard deviation of the
logit of the propensity score. No discards or replacements
were employed. All P-values were 2-tailed, with P < 0.05
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were
conducted with the software package SPSS 24.0 (IBM, New
York, USA).
RESULTS
Suitable Cut-Points of Surgical Margin
Distance
In this study, 904 patients who met the inclusion criteria were
included. Based on the X-tile plots results, both RFS and OS
of 904 HCC patients obtained the biggest discrimination when
using 2 mm as the cutoff value of surgical margin distance
(Figure 1A: RFS, P < 0.0001, χ
2 = 37.9838; Figure 1B: OS,
P = 0.0008, χ
2 = 18.2927). As such, patients who underwent
a ≤2 mm surgical margin LR were defined as “narrow￾margin” group (n = 440); otherwise, “wide-margin” group
(n = 464). Supplementary Table 1 shows the χ
2
and P-values
when other surgical margin distance values were used as the
cutoff point.

Patient Demographics
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of all the patients.
After PSM analysis, 335 pairs of patients were selected, and
comparisons of all parameters between the two groups revealed
no significant differences (Table 1, all P > 0.05). In the whole
patients, perioperative mortality (≤60 days) occurred in 5
patients (0.55%), of which 4 and 1 patients underwent narrow￾and wide-margin LR.
Impact of Surgical Margin on Prognosis
For the whole patients, a narrow-margin LR provided a more
adverse prognosis than a wide-margin LR, with 1-, 3-, and
5-year RFS rates being 76.1, 49.3, and 39.6% vs. 85.3, 69.5,
and 59.1%, respectively (Figure 2A, P < 0.001). The mean
RFSs in narrow- and wide-margin groups were 35.32 and 44.67
months, respectively. The corresponding OS rates were 95.2, 84.1,
and 73.7% vs. 98.7, 91.2, and 85.3%, respectively (Figure 2B,
P < 0.001). The mean OS in narrow- and wide-margin groups
were 52.16 and 55.88 months, respectively.
For the patients of the PSM group, the results also showed
that narrow-margin LR indicated a poorer prognosis compared
with wide-margin LR. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rates in narrow￾and wide-margin groups were 74.4, 48.2, and 41.0% vs. 82.6, 66.9,
and 56.3%, respectively (Figure 2C, P < 0.001). The mean time
of RFS was 35.00 months in the narrow-margin group and 43.09
months in the wide-margin group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates
in corresponding groups were 94.9, 84.0, and 75.0% vs. 98.2, 90.3,
and 83.0%, respectively (Figure 2D, P = 0.010). The mean time
of OS was 52.26 months in the narrow-margin group and 55.33
months in the wide-margin group.
Subgroup Survival Analysis Based on MVI
and Liver Cirrhosis
Subgroup analysis for the whole patients showed
that wide-margin surgery benefits more on prognosis

for both MVI-negative and MVI-positive patients
(Supplementary Figure 1). However, for the patients in the
PSM group, the influence of surgical margin on prognosis was
distinguished by presence of MVI. For the patients without MVI,
both RFS and OS showed no significant difference in narrow￾and wide-margin groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rates in
the two groups were 81.4, 57.7, and 50.6% vs. 87.9, 71.1, and
56.1%, respectively (Figure 3A, P = 0.113). The 1-, 3-, and
5-year OS rates in the two groups were 98.0, 94.0, and 86.2%
vs. 99.0, 94.4, and 87.5%, respectively (Figure 3B, P = 0.720).
For the patients with MVI, the narrow-margin group obtained
a higher recurrence rate than did the wide-margin group. The
1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rates in the two groups were 63.3, 32.8,
and 25.4% vs. 74.9, 60.6, and 56.7%, respectively (Figure 3C,
P < 0.001). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates in the two groups
were 89.9, 67.8, and 56.8% vs. 97.1, 84.2, and 76.3%, respectively
(Figure 3D, P = 0.001). The predictive model of MVI is shown
in Supplementary Table 2.
Subgroup analysis for the whole patients based on the liver
cirrhosis is shown in Supplementary Figure 2. The impact of
surgical margin on prognosis was distinguished by presence
of liver cirrhosis for the patients of the PSM group. For the
patients without liver cirrhosis, those who underwent a wide￾margin LR obtained better clinical outcomes than did patients
who underwent a narrow-margin LR. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year
RFS rates in the two groups were 89.3, 78.6, and 68.7% vs.
74.8, 49.1, and 39.5%, respectively (Figure 4A, P < 0.001). The
1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates in the two groups were 99.2, 94.2,
and 90.9% vs. 97.6, 87.0, and 75.0%, respectively (Figure 4B,
P = 0.001). For the patients with liver cirrhosis, there is no
statistical difference by wide- or narrow-margin LR. The 1-, 3-,
and 5-year RFS rates in the two groups were 78.7, 60.1, and
49.0% vs. 74.2, 47.6, and 42.0%, respectively (Figure 4C, P =
0.088). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates in the two groups were
97.6, 88.0, and 78.2% vs. 93.2, 82.2, and 75.0%, respectively

Prognostic Factors of RFS and OS
Results on the Cox regression analysis of the whole patients
for RFS and OS are revealed in Table 2. Multivariable analysis
included male, lower ALB, higher aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), higher GGT, higher PT, presence of MVI, and narrow￾margin LR as the independent prognostic determinants of poorer
RFS. Higher GGT, larger tumor diameter, liver cirrhosis, presence
of MVI, and narrow-margin LR were independently correlated
with poorer OS.
Prognostic Factors of Early and Late
Tumor Recurrence
The independent risk factors for early tumor recurrence (<2
years) were assessed among all the 904 patients, whereas the
factors associated with late recurrence were analyzed among the
596 patients who had a postoperative recurrence after 2 years
or more or did not recur (Table 3). The multivariable analyses
indicated that the following factors were related to early relapse:
AST, AFP, HBV DNA load, tumor capsule, MVI, and surgical
margin. Simultaneously, late relapse was associated with GGT,
Child–Pugh classification, and liver cirrhosis. The recurrence
pattern of all patients is shown in Supplementary Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Hepatic resection has been accepted as the preferred treatment
method for single-nodule HCC patients with well-preserved liver
function (29). Nevertheless, it is still worth exploring how to
cut the tumors thoroughly and preserve liver volume to the
greatest extent. However, there is still controversial on patient
selection, standard of surgery, and its distributed impact on
prognosis (30, 31). Given that large-size tumor calls for more
stringent method about volume of residual liver parenchyma,
and multinodular HCC is difficult to make statistical assessment,
solitary early HCCs up to 5 cm served as the research population
of this study. For the best treatment method of those HCCs, LR

and ablation are always employed for comparison. A real-world
study showed that LR possessed superior intrahepatic control
rate than radiofrequency ablation in most conditions of HCC
smaller than 5 cm (32). Another study based on the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results database also revealed that
LR may confer more survival benefits than radiofrequency
ablation for different tumor sizes measuring up to 5 cm and may
be an appropriate first-line treatment (33). For the recurrent
early HCC, a randomized clinical trial suggested that repeat
hepatectomy was associated with better OS than radiofrequency
ablation among patients with a tumor diameter from 3 to 5 cm.
Therefore, LR still may have advantages in the radical removal of
tumor. Furthermore, most reports indicated that the benefit of
a wide margin of LR is more prominent (34–36). Therefore, we
explore the influence of surgical margin on the prognosis of early
HCC patients.
Taking 2 mm as the cutoff point of surgical margin, the results
suggested that the surgical extent of LR significantly affects
disease recurrence and long-term survival in treating early HCC,
and we observed a significant 19.5% decrease in the 5-year
recurrence rate and an 11.6% increase in the 5-year OS rate for
the wide-margin LR group when compared to the narrow-margin

LR group, and similar results were demonstrated after PSM. In
addition, a low perioperative mortality could be maintained. All
these results prompted that a wide-margin LR is an effective and
safety intervention.
Previous viewpoint reminded that the necessity of adequate
surgical margin was mainly to completely remove MVI and its
subsequent portal dissemination and satellitosis (37). Therefore,
subgroup analyses were performed to explore the impact of
MVI on surgical margin. For the whole patients, survival
analysis showed that patients with or without MVI all could
benefit from a wide-margin surgery. We deemed it might be
attributed to the imbalance of baseline characteristics, and
therefore we performed a PSM analysis. It was remarkable
that our study revealed that wide-margin LR only significantly
improved the prognosis of early HCC patients with MVI
instead of those without MVI after PSM. Our results also
corroborated that MVI was significantly associated with early
recurrence rather than late recurrence. As such, integrating the
close relationship between early recurrence and intrahepatic
relapse of residual tumor, a wide-margin LR is a useful
intervention of MVI-positive early HCC patients. In addition,
liver cirrhosis represents the baseline liver state of patients and
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 139

Wang et al. Surgical Margin for Early HCC
is associated with recurrence (38). In our study, the whole
patients who were with absence of liver cirrhosis could benefit
from a wide-margin surgery in RFS and OS, and those who
were with presence of liver cirrhosis could not benefit from
a wide-margin surgery in OS, whereas after PSM, it was
remarkable that our results suggest that only patients without
liver cirrhosis could apparently benefit from a wide-margin
LR. We suppose that liver fibrosis is the inducement of HCC
and simultaneously the mechanism to repair chronic injury.
Therefore, a certain degree of proliferation of fibrous tissue
in liver can limit the occurrence of tumor micrometastasis,
especially the occurrence of MVI. Our results also showed
that presence of tumor capsule, which reflects hepatic fibrosis
response, was obviously associated with low risk of MVI and early
recurrence. Therefore, a detailed assessment of MVI and liver
cirrhosis before operation is essential. We also suggest that HCC
patients with absence of liver cirrhosis can benefit most from
wide-margin LR.
Different from liver cirrhosis, which can be roughly judged
by preoperative laboratory testing and intraoperative gross
observation, MVI is a histopathological appearance that could be
detected only with microscopy. It is almost implausible to make
a decision on resection margin precisely based on the presence
of MVI before hepatectomy. Therefore, the storm eye is whether
it is enforceable to accurately predict the presence of MVI
preoperatively. Scholars launched a great quantity of works about
this topic. For instance, Banerjee et al. (39) used radiogenomic
venous invasion, a contrast-enhanced CT biomarker, to predict
MVI. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of
it in predicting MVI were 89, 76, and 94%, respectively. Lee
et al. (40) applied arterial peritumoral enhancement, non-smooth
tumor margin, and peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary
phase based on gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI to realize a
>90% specificity of MVI prediction. Furthermore, artificial
neural network and nomogram were also performed to develop
reference to both imaging and laboratory test in order to
make MVI prediction more diversified (41, 42). We also build
a predicted model of MVI based on the patients in our
study, which included ALP, AFP, PT, and tumor capsule. To
a certain degree, this model could help in clinical screening
of the population with high risk of MVI to adopt appropriate
surgical strategies.
To our best knowledge, this study was the first to analyze
the impact of surgical margin on the early HCC up to
5 cm and to suggest its correspondence with MVI and liver
cirrhosis. However, the study still had several limitations.
First, the study design was retrospective and therefore was
subject to various inherent biases, which may have affected
the reliability of some results. Second, the study involved
designations of ≤2 mm as “narrow” and >2 mm as “wide”
resection margins, whereas other studies used different values,
which could present bias when comparing results across
studies. The best surgical margin distance for various HCC
patients still needs further exploration for more details and
more individuals. Finally, our predictive model of MVI
lacked external validation. Future studies will need to validate
our findings in external population of both Eastern and
Western patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients undergoing curative resection for solitary early
HCC up to 5 cm, our study showed that a “wide-margin”
(>2 mm) vs. “narrow-margin” (≤2 mm) surgical resection has a
preponderant effect on both RFS and OS, especially for patients
with presence of MVI and absence of liver cirrhosis. An MVI
predictive model has also been proposed and recommended to
be routinely used in the preoperative assessment to assist in
the adoption of proper surgical procedures. Appropriate surgical
margin should be assessed preoperatively based on both tumor
factors and background liver factors.
