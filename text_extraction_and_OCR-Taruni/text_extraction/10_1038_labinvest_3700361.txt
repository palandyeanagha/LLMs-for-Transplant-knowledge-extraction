Rapamycin inhibits the development and progression of vascular disease. We previously showed that
rapamycin induces the cytoprotective protein, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and more importantly, chemically
inhibiting HO-1 blocked the antiproliferative actions of rapamycin. In this study, we evaluated whether HO-1 is
required for the vascular protective effects of rapamycin in vivo using a rat monocrotaline-induced pulmonary
hypertension model. Rats were exposed to monocrotaline with or without rapamycin and HO activity was
altered using the chemical inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin or the inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin. We also
evaluated possible mechanisms of rapamycin-dependent induction of HO-1, and how HO-1 mediates growth
factor-dependent antiproliferative actions of rapamycin. Proliferation and cell cycle progression were examined
in smooth muscle cells derived from both wild-type and HO-1 knockout (HO-1/) mice in response to growth
factors and rapamycin. Similar to our previous findings in vitro, rapamycin induced HO-1 in rat lung. Rapamycin
also inhibited the development of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension, and this protective effect
was blocked with the addition of tin protoporphyrin. In addition, treatment with cobalt protoporphyrin resulted
in a substantial protection in this model of pulmonary hypertension. Rapamycin induction of HO-1 was
dependent upon a transcriptional event; however, it was not mediated through an altered redox state or
mammalian targets of rapamycin inhibition. Unlike wild-type cells, the growth of HO-1/ mouse aortic smooth
muscle cells was not inhibited or cell cycle arrested in G1 in response to rapamycin. This study demonstrates
that HO-1 is critical for the antiproliferative and vascular protective effects of rapamycin in vitro and in vivo in
monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension.

The fibroproliferative response to injury is a patho￾logic property of vascular diseases, such as pulmon￾ary hypertension.1–3 Pathologic changes observed in
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) include
medial hypertrophy, adventitial thickening, and
abnormal growth of endothelial cells. A limitation
of current therapies for PAH is that they are mostly
aimed at vasodilatation, rather than against the
fibroproliferative response.1,3 Rapamycin is an
immunosuppressive agent with antiproliferative acti￾vity not only against lymphocytes but also against
vascular cells.4–6 Since cellular proliferation is a
hallmark of PAH, antiproliferative agents such as
rapamycin may be an attractive therapeutic alter￾native. In fact, rapamycin reduces neointimal for￾mation in a balloon injury model of vascular
disease7,8 and is used in stents to prevent vascular
restenosis.9 Rapamycin has been shown to attenuate
pulmonary hypertension and neointimal formation
in a rat model of PAH.10 The mechanisms under￾lying these protective effects are unknown, but they
are unlikely to be the result of rapamycin’s im￾munosuppressive properties, since other immuno￾suppressive agents have no protective effects in
PAH,11 and do not inhibit growth factor-dependent
proliferation of vascular cells.12

and protein synthesis and cell cycle arrest.13 The
antiproliferative effects of rapamycin on mesenchy￾mal cells led to its use in fibroproliferative vascular
disorders. However, its full spectrum of actions
and the exact mechanisms underlying its vascular
protective effects have not been elucidated. We
reported that rapamycin induces the cytoprotective
protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and inhibits
growth factor-dependent proliferation of human
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC).
More importantly, we showed that rapamycin
required HO-1 for its antiproliferative effects, since
chemical inhibition of HO activity with tin proto￾porphyrin resulted in a loss of its effects on smooth
muscle cell (SMC) proliferation.14
HO is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation
of heme to biliverdin, and subsequently to bilir￾ubin.15 There are two major isoenzymes of HO, with
HO-1 being the inducible isoform and HO-2 the
constitutive isoform. HO-1 induction is believed to
be a cytoprotective response, and has been shown to
have vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiapop￾totic properties.16,17 An increase in HO-1 prevented
hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and in￾flammation.18 Concomitantly, a lack of HO-1 expres￾sion (HO-1 knockout mice) is associated with
organized mural thrombi and subsequent pulmon￾ary hypertension in response to hypoxia.19
In this study, we evaluated whether rapamycin’s
vascular protective effects in vivo were possibly
mediated through HO-1 using a rat monocrotaline
model of PAH. In addition, we further evaluated the
role of HO-1 in mediating the antiproliferative
effects of rapamycin in aortic SMC derived from
HO-1-deficient (HO-1/) and wild-type mice.
Materials and methods
Material Supplies
Monocrotaline, platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin, actino￾mycin D, and cycloheximide were purchased from
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA. Rapamycin was pro￾vided by Weyth Research, Monmouth Junction, NJ,
USA. Tin (IV) and cobalt (III) protoporphyrin IX
chloride (SnPP and CoPP) were purchased from
Frontier Scientific, Logan, UT, USA.
Animal Model
Male Sprague–Dawley rats were purchased from
Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA. The investigation
conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the US National
Institutes of Health. Control groups received sub￾cutaneous injection of vehicle and olive oil by
gavage. Monocrotaline, 100 mg/kg, was given by
subcutaneous injection, and rapamycin, 2 mg/kg,
was given daily by gavage starting 1 day prior to
monocrotaline injection. Preliminary studies in our
laboratory demonstrated that 2 mg/kg of rapamycin
resulted in a 24 h trough level of B5 ng/ml. SnPP
and CoPP, 20 mmol/kg, were given by subcutaneous
injection on days 5 and 15. The following are
the number of animals per experimental group:
control ¼ six; rapamycin ¼ four; monocrotaline ¼ six;
monocrotaline þ rapamycin ¼ six; monocrotaline þ
rapamycinþ SnPP¼ six; monocrotalineþ SnPP¼ six;
SnPP¼ four; CoPP¼ four; monocrotalineþ CoPP¼ six.
After 28 days, hemodynamic measurements were
made and animals were killed. Rats were anesthe￾tized with isoflurane/oxygen, intubated orotrache￾ally, and ventilated with room air/isoflurane. The
heart was exposed through a midline chest incision,
and a Millar catheter inserted through the right
ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary
artery pressure (PaP) was monitored and data were
collected using PowerLab system and software
(ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). The
lungs were then flushed until clear with ice-cold
saline at 20 cm H2O. The right lung and heart was
removed and the right ventricle (RV) separated from
the left ventricle (LV) and septum (S), and weighed.
The right lung was frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at 801C. The left lung was filled with 10%
buffered formalin, removed, fixed overnight, and
paraffin embedded. Sections (5 mm) were cut at two
levels in the paraffin block and stained with a
standard hematoxylin–eosin stain, and additional
staining was performed using Verhoeff–van Gieson
stains to highlight elastic lamina. Neointimal for￾mation was determined by computerized morpho￾metry20 and is represented as lumen size to total
vessel size, calculated by area within the internal
elastic lamina/area within external elastic lamina
 100 using image analysis software (Zeiss Axio￾plan 2 with SPOT digital camera and image analysis,
Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI,
USA).
Cell Culture
HPASMC (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD, USA) were
grown in SmGM media (SmBM-basal media plus
growth factors, Clonetics) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Human alveolar rhabdomyosar
coma (Rh30) cells expressing wild-type mTOR or rapa￾mycin-resistant mTOR were obtained from PJ
Houghton (St Jude, Memphis, TN, USA)21 and main￾tained in DMEM with 10% FBS. Mouse aortic SMC
(mSMC) were isolated from wild-type or HO-1/
mice by collagenase and elastase treatment of
isolated aortas. Cells were resuspended in SmGM
media containing 10% FBS in room air/5%CO2 at
371C. SMC cells were verified by staining for a￾smooth muscle actin (0.5 mg/ml mouse monoclonal
a-actin, FITC, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and identi￾fied under a fluorescence microscope. HO-1/ mice
(C57BL/6 background) were originally from Susumu

Tonegawa’s laboratory (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA).22 Owing to a
low yield of homozygous mice, the original breed￾ing colony was backcrossed with FVB to derive a
HO-1/ colony with a predominant FVB back￾ground resulting in an increased yield of homo￾zygous mice.23
Protein Isolation and Western Analysis
In all, 106 cells/ml were washed and lysed with
Triton lysis buffer. Frozen lung tissue was homo￾genized in 20 mM KPO4 buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM
EDTA, 135 mM KCl, and the homogenate was
sonicated, centrifuged, and resuspended in 20 mM
KPO4 buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM KCl. Total
protein (30 mg) was separated using a 10% SDS￾polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinyli￾dene difluoride membrane (Immobilont-P, Mili￾pore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mM Tris pH
7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 and
incubated for 1.5 h with mouse anti-P21 antibody
(Santa Cruz, California, CA, USA), rabbit anti-P27
antibody, mouse anti-Cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), or rabbit anti-HO￾1 (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada). The proteins
were visualized using a secondary antibody, perox￾idase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
IgG antibody, and chemiluminescence according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations (Pierce, Rock￾ford, IL, USA).
RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis
Total RNA was isolated and purified using RNeasy
mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The RNA
was fractionated by size on a 1% agarose, 6%
formaldehyde gel buffered by 3-(N-morpholino)
propanesulfonic acid, electrotransferred to a nylon
membrane, and crosslinked with ultraviolet light.
The RNA was hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNAs, HO￾1, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as an internal control. The membranes
were subjected to autoradiography using an intensi￾fying screen at 801C.
Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfection
Analysis
HO-1 promoter activity was evaluated using 11.6
and 4.5 kb human HO-1 promoter constructs
(pHOGL3/11.6 or 4.5) as previously described.24
A batch transfection protocol was performed in
HPASMC using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carls￾bad, CA, USA) as previously described.25 The day
after transfection, cells were split into smaller plates
and then allowed to recover for 24 h before stimula￾tion in 1% FBS in complete media with or without
rapamycin or hemin for 16 h. Cell lysates were
collected and luciferase activity was measured
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pro￾mega, Madison, WI, USA).
Analysis of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species
HPASMC in media with 1% FBS were treated with a
general oxidant scavenger, 10 mM NAC 1 h prior to
treatment with or without rapamycin (10 mM) for 4 h,
and evaluated using 20
-70
-dichlorofluorescein-diace￾tate (DCF-DA) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)
at a final concentration of 2 mM and incubated for
45 min at 371C. Following 30 min, cells were washed
and harvested, and fluorescence was determined by
flow cytometry (FACS-SCAN, Becton-Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Cell Proliferation Assay
Two  103 wild-type or HO-1/ mSMC were split
into 96-well plates with SmGM plus 10% FBS for
24 h. The cells were placed in SmGM containing 1%
FBS for another 24 h, then treated with PDGF (10 ng/
ml), rapamycin (10 mM), or SmGM with 10% FBS for
48 h. Proliferation was evaluated using the tetra￾zolium-based assay (XTT) and 5-bromo-2-deoxy￾uridine (Brdu) cell proliferation kits (Roche, India￾napolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Cell Cycle Analysis
Five  105 wild-type or HO-1/ mSMC were plated
in 100 mm plates and incubated in SmGM 10% FBS
for 24 h, then starved in SmGM 1% FBS for another
24 h. Cell cycle phase was evaluated by FACS
analysis with propidium iodide (PI) following 48 h
of treatment; SmGM in 1% FBS with or without
PDGF (10 ng/ml), rapamycin (10 mM), or SmGM in
10% FBS.
Statistics
Data are expressed as mean7s.e.m., and statistical
analyses performed using the Prism statistical
program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). One￾way ANOVA with the Tukey–Kramer multiple
comparisons test was used to evaluate differences
between groups. Linear correlations were evaluated
using Pearson r. A P-value o0.05 was considered
significant.
Results
We previously reported that the chemical inhibitor
of HO-1, SnPP, inhibited the antiproliferative
actions of rapamycin in HPASMC,14 suggesting that
the vascular protective effects of rapamycin may be

dependent upon HO-1. To verify whether HO-1
plays a critical role in rapamycin’s protective effects
in vascular disease, we used a rat monocrotaline￾induced PAH model. Similar to our in vitro
studies,14 rapamycin induces lung HO-1 expression.
Rapamycin increases HO-1 protein levels approxi￾mately three-fold following 5 days of exposure
(Figure 1). Interestingly, cotreatment of the rats with
SnPP resulted in a loss of HO-1 induction in
rapamycin þ monocrotaline-treated animals. Nishi￾mura et al10 previously demonstrated that rapamy￾cin inhibited monocrotaline-induced PAH. We also
found that rapamycin attenuated the increase in PaP
and neointimal formation in response to monocrota￾line (Figure 2). In this study, we examined neointi￾mal formation based on lumen size (luminal area/
total vessel area). We found a strong negative
correlation of lumen size with PaP, Po0.0001
(Figure 2c). More importantly, we found that
inhibiting HO-1 using SnPP resulted in a loss of
the protective effects of rapamycin against mono￾crotaline-induced disease, indicating a role of
HO-1 in the cytoprotective actions of rapamycin
in vivo. In addition, inducing HO-1 with CoPP
resulted in a dramatic inhibition of monocrotaline￾induced PAH with both PaP and lumen size being
similar to normal vessels, thereby demonstrating the
protective effects of HO-1 in pulmonary vascular
disease.
A correlate to increased PaP is right ventricular
hypertrophy (RVH), which is represented based on
RV weight to LV plus S weight (Figures 3a and b). As
expected, there was a highly significant correlation
of PaP to RV/LV þ S. Both rapamycin and CoPP

attenuated monocrotaline-induced RVH. Unlike PaP
and neointimal formation, rapamycin-dependent
inhibition of monocrotaline-induced RVH was
not blocked with SnPP. This does not appear
to be related to the addition of SnPP since mono￾crotaline þ SnPP had elevated PaP and RV/LV þ S.
To better evaluate the role of HO-1 in the
antiproliferative effects of rapamycin, we isolated
mSMC from wild-type and HO-1/ mice (Figure
4a). Similar to human SMC, mSMC lacking HO-1 are
not responsive to the antiproliferative actions of
rapamycin. Figures 4b and c show wild-type and
HO-1/ mSMC exposed to PDGF and proliferation
evaluated with and without rapamycin. PDGF
induced proliferation of both wild-type and HO-1/
mSMC. As expected, rapamycin inhibited PDGF￾dependent growth of wild-type mSMC; however,
rapamycin had little effect on PDGF-stimulated
growth of HO-1/ mSMC.
The antiproliferative actions of rapamycin are a
result of blocking cell cycle progression in G113 and
this was observed in wild-type mSMC (Figure 4d).
However, rapamycin failed to arrest cell cycle
progression in HO-1/ mSMC. Rapamycin inhibits
cell cycle progression via upregulation of the cyclin￾dependent kinase inhibitor, p27kip1.
26 We observed
similar expression of p27 and the cell cycle proteins
p21 and cyclin D1 in both wild-type and HO-1/
mSMC, indicating a p27-independent process
(Figure 4e).
HO-1 induction by a variety of stimuli is depen￾dent upon a transcriptional event.27 We found this to
be also true in response to rapamycin (Figure 5a).
Rapamycin-dependent induction of HO-1 mRNA is
inhibited using actinomycin D, RNA synthesis
inhibitor; however, there was little difference in
HO-1 mRNA in response to cycloheximide, a
protein synthesis inhibitor. We also observed an
increase in HO-1 promoter activity in response to
rapamycin similar to the response observed with
hemin although to a lesser degree (Figure 5b).
Rapamycin inhibits mTOR, and we previously
showed that wortmannin, an inhibitor of the up￾stream kinase PI-3K, also induced HO-1 expres￾sion.14 However, we found that LY294002, a more
selective inhibitor of PI-3K had no effect on HO-1
expression (data not shown). To determine if HO-1
induction by rapamycin was through mTOR inhibi￾Figure 2 Continued.

expressing either wild-type or a rapamycin-resistant
mutant of mTOR. HO-1 expression was similar in

both wild-type and mTOR-deficient Rh30 cells
in response to rapamycin, thereby indicating an
mTOR-independent mechanism of rapamycin
(Figure 5c).
HO-1 is induced by oxidants and is a marker of
oxidative stress28 leading to the possibility that
rapamycin-mediated induction of HO-1 results from
an altered redox state. We found that rapamycin
increases cellular oxidation based on DCF analysis
and this was completely inhibited with the anti￾oxidant NAC (Figure 6a). However, pretreating cells
with NAC had relatively little attenuation of HO-1
by rapamycin, indicating that its effect on HO-1 is at
most partially mediated by an altered redox state
(Figure 6b and c).
Discussion
Vascular remodeling is a hallmark in the progression
of PAH.1,2 Eventually, these changes result in
irreversible increases in PVR and right heart failure.
Therefore, developing therapies that inhibit or
reverse vascular remodeling is critical for the
long-term management of PAH. Rapamycin is an

immunosuppressive agent with potent vascular anti￾proliferative activities and is effective in preventing
neointimal formation.7–10 In fact, the implantation of
rapamycin-coated stents has been shown to be safe
and effective in preventing neointimal formation
following stent placement in coronary artery dis￾ease.7–9 Recently, the potential benefit of rapamycin
in PAH was illustrated in a rat monocrotaline
model.10 However, the mechanisms underlying these
effects remain unknown. Our laboratory recently
found that rapamycin is an inducer of HO-1, which
by itself has been shown to be protective against
vascular remodeling.18,29 Furthermore, our previous
data suggest that HO-1 is required for the antiproli￾ferative effects of rapamycin.
In this study, we verified the findings that
rapamycin not only inhibits systemic vascular
disorders, but also protects against pulmonary
vascular disease blocking both an increase in PaP
and neointimal formation. We found that rapamycin
exposure increased lung HO-1 expression prior to
the onset of significant injury from monocrotaline.
The induction of HO-1 in rapamycin- and mono￾crotaline-treated animals was inhibited by SnPP, so
that it not only acted as a competitive inhibitor but
also affected its expression. More importantly, we
found that inhibiting HO activity using the chemical
inhibitor SnPP resulted in a loss of the vascular
protective actions of rapamycin thus verifying the
role of HO-1 in mediating rapamycin’s antiprolifera￾tive effects in vascular disease. This study further
demonstrates the cytoprotective effects of HO-1 in
ameliorating pulmonary vascular disease. We found
that the chemical inducer of HO, CoPP, resulted in a
dramatic improvement of monocrotaline-induced
pulmonary vascular disease.
Right-sided heart failure is a poor prognostic
factor for survival in patients with pulmonary
hypertension.1 Initially, RVH is an adaptive res￾ponse to maintain right heart function against
an elevated PVR, and HO-1 may play a role in
this adaptive response. HO-1-deficient mice with
hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension develop
right-sided heart infarcts, a feature not observed
in wild-type mice.19 Our studies did not show
any differences in RVH with the addition of SnPP.
Animals treated with rapamycin failed to increase
right ventricular size in the face of an elevated PaP,
which may be detrimental for survival, although, no
mortality was observed in any of the experimental
groups at 28 days post monocrotaline exposure.
Previously, rapamycin was found to attenuate
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy.30
Similarly, we also found that rapamycin blocked
the development of RVH in response to monocrota￾line. However, unlike the pulmonary vasculature
where SnPP inhibited rapamycin’s effects, in cardi￾ac muscle there was no effect on rapamycin’s growth
inhibition. This suggests that rapamycin antiproli￾ferative actions are different on pulmonary vascular
SMC and cardiac muscle cells.
Our previous study in HPASMC demonstrated an
increase in HO-1 at only relatively higher doses of
rapamycin.14 In addition, we found that the highly
selective inhibitor, LY294004, of PI-3K, an upstream
signaling molecule of the mTOR pathway, had no
effect on HO-1 expression (data not shown). These
data suggest that the induction of HO-1 by rapamy￾cin may not involve mTOR pathway. This was
further confirmed by the fact that rapamycin￾dependent HO-1 induction was similar in mutant
mTOR and wild-type Rh30 cells.
Since HO-1 expression is a sensitive marker for
oxidant stress,25 and rapamycin altered the redox
state of HPASMC, we tested the possibility that HO-1
induction by rapamycin was an oxidant-mediated
event. The general antioxidant, NAC, blocked
rapamycin-mediated increase in oxidants; however,
NAC had only partial effect on rapamycin-depen￾dent HO-1 induction, indicating a redox-indepen￾dent mechanism. These findings are similar to HO-1
induction by growth factors such as transforming
growth factor-b in renal epithelial cells, wherein
NAC is unable to block HO-1 induction.31
To verify that the findings observed using the
chemical inhibitor SnPP is related to its inhibition
of HO-1, we evaluated SMC derived from both wild￾type and HO-1/ mice. Since the vascular protec￾tive effects of rapamycin have been shown in
both systemic and pulmonary vascular SMC,4,7,8,14
we isolated aortic SMC and evaluated potential
mechanisms for the loss of rapamycin’s antiproli￾ferative properties. This study using vascular
SMC derived from HO-1/ mice verifies the critical
role of HO-1 in mediating the vascular antiprolifera￾tive actions of rapamycin. SMC deficient in HO-1
were not responsive to the antiproliferative or cell
cycle inhibition actions of rapamycin.
One possibility for the ineffectiveness of rapamy￾cin in HO-1-deficient cells is that these cells have
an altered expression of cell cycle proteins. As
discussed above, rapamycin is best known for inhi￾biting mTOR,32 and its inhibition of cell cycle
progression was shown to be mediated by increasing
the cell cycle inhibitory protein, p27kip1,
26 thereby
inhibiting cell cycle progression. In addition, HO-1
overexpression is known to inhibit cell growth and
this is associated with an increase in the inhibitory
protein p21cip.
33,34 We found that p27kip1, p21cip, and
cyclin D expression in response to growth factors
and rapamycin were similar in wild-type and HO￾1/ mSMC. So unlike HO-1 overexpression, HO-1
deficiency effects are not mediated through p21cip.
The possibility that HO-1 and rapamycin interaction
is not through rapamycin’s inhibition of mTOR is
further verified with the p27kip1 results, since rapa￾mycin effects on p27kip1 are downstream to mTOR.
Recent studies have shown that products of HO-1
activity, carbon monoxide or biliverdin/bilirubin, in￾hibit SMC proliferation by activating p38b mitogen￾activated protein kinase.35,36 Downstream effects
of both products result in an inhibition of cell

cycle-dependent proteins with carbon monoxide
altering caveolin expression and subsequently
p21cip,
35 while bilirubin effects may be mediated
by inhibition of phosphorylation of the retino￾blastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb).36 Carbon
monoxide and/or bilirubin may also mediate HO-1
effects in pulmonary hypertension, and future
studies are planned to evaluate these products along
with HO-1 actions on heme/iron metabolism.
Rapamycin treatment differentially express B10%
of the genes in smooth muscle cells.37 These
include cell cycle proteins such as the transcription
factor E2F-1, and various Rb/E2F-1-regulated genes
such as cyclin D3 and YY1 transcription factor.37
Similarly, HO-1 through the generation of its by￾products also inhibits the expression of several cell
cycle proteins and inhibits hyperphosphorylation of
Rb.36 In addition, YY1 which regulates cell growth is
also inhibited by bilirubin treatment.36 Furthermore,
we found that rapamycin action on HO-1 expression
is not mediated through mTOR, which requires
rapamycin binding to FKBP12. Rapamycin poten￾tially may bind to the another FKBP, such as
FKBP25, which is known to alter DNA-binding
activity of YY1.38 The similar actions of HO-1 and
rapamycin on the Rb/E2F-1/YY1 pathway suggest
that this pathway may be involved in rapamycin’s
interaction with HO-1, and will be tested in the
future.
Rapamycin has been shown to attenuate athero￾sclerosis in apoplipoprotein-deficient mice in a
p27kip1-independent manner,39 which may be simi￾lar to our finding in which the lack of rapamycin
antiproliferative effects in HO-1-deficient cells
does not appear to be mediated through p27kip1.
In addition to its effects on cell cycle proteins,
rapamycin inhibited the upregulation of monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in these mice.39
Interestingly, HO-1 overexpression also protects
apolipoprotein-deficient mice40 while a HO-1 defi￾ciency exacerbates atherosclerosis.41 HO-1 also in￾hibits the upregulation of MCP-1,42 suggesting
another potential interaction between rapamycin
and HO-1.
In summary, this study demonstrates that HO-1
plays an important role in mediating the vascular
protective effects of rapamycin in both pulmonary
and systemic vasculature. HO-1-deficient SMC are
not sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of
rapamycin in vitro and in vivo. The loss of HO-1
results in rapamycin resistance, although this does
not appear to be mediated through it usual effects on
mTOR nor alteration of cell cycle proteins (p21cip,
p27kip1, or cyclin D1) involved in the actions of HO-1
and rapamycin.
