Herein presented is the case of a 51-year-old 
male with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 
(EDMD) with a history of rapid progression heart 
failure (HF) and heart rhythm disturbances over 
an 8 year period. EDMD is a rare genetic condition 
that primarily affects skeletal muscles. The patient 
presented with muscle weakness since childhood. 
Family history was negative. At the age of 43 atrial 
fibrillation was diagnosed and 2 years later a single 
chamber pacemaker was implanted due to third 
atrioventricular block. After another 2 years, the 
patient was admitted due to ventricular tachy￾cardia. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 
revealed moderately reduced left ventricular func￾tion (ejection fraction [EF] 48%). A single-chamber 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD-VR) was implanted. 
After 2 years of well-being, he was admitted to the 
hospital due to an electrical storm. TTE revealed 
dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular 
dysfunction (EF 15%). Due to clinical presentation, 
a high percentage of right ventricular pacing, and 
wide QRS complex (paced QRS 200 ms) the patient 
qualified for cardiac resynchronization therapy with 
defibrillator (CRT-D). The left ventricular electrode 
was implanted and ICD was upgraded to CRT-D 
resulting in a correct VVI-BiV stimulation with 
narrowing of QRS complexes to 140 ms. TTE 
performed after another few months showed 
significantly improved EF (30%). After another 
year a right ventricular lead malfunction occurred 
— myopotential oversensing and inappropriate 
detection of ventricular tachycardia. Connection of 
the right ventricular pace/sense lead to the pace￾sense header resulted in proper sensing. Since 
then the patient has remained stable. EDMD leads 
to HF, arrhythmias and conduction disturbances 
in about 30% of cases. It is thus believed that 
implantation of CRT-D in an early stage of cardiac 
involvement may both treat arrhythmias and slow 
HF progression (Fig. 1).
