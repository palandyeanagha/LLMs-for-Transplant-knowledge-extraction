ABSTRACT
Background: Previous studies investigating a genetic
basis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have
focused on resequencing single genes in IPF kindreds
or cohorts to determine the genetic contributions to
IPF. None has investigated interactions among the
candidate genes.
Objective: To compare the frequencies and
interactions of mutations in six IPF-associated genes in
a cohort of 132 individuals with IPF with those of a
disease-control cohort of 192 individuals with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the
population represented in the Exome Variant Server.
Methods: We resequenced the genes encoding
surfactant proteins A2 (SFTPA2), and C (SFTPC), the
ATP binding cassette member A3 (ABCA3), telomerase
(TERT), thyroid transcription factor (NKX2-1) and
mucin 5B (MUC5B) and compared the collapsed
frequencies of rare (minor allele frequency <1%),
computationally predicted deleterious variants in each
cohort. We also genotyped a common MUC5B
promoter variant that is over-represented in individuals
with IPF.
Results: We found 15 mutations in 14 individuals
(11%) in the IPF cohort: (SFTPA2 (n=1), SFTPC (n=5),
ABCA3 (n=4) and TERT (n=5)). No individual with IPF
had two different mutations, but one individual with
IPF was homozygous for p.E292V, the most common
ABCA3 disease-causing variant. We did not detect an
interaction between any of the mutations and the
MUC5B promoter variant.
Conclusions: Rare mutations in SFTPA2, SFTPC and
TERT are collectively over-represented in individuals
with IPF. Genetic analysis and counselling should be
considered as part of the IPF evaluation.
INTRODUCTION
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the
most common chronic interstitial lung
disease (ILD) in adults.1 With an average
presenting age of 60–70 years, the clinical
course is one of progressive decline in lung
function or precipitous deterioration follow￾ing an acute exacerbation. With a median
survival of only 2–3 years after diagnosis, it is
one of the most common indications for
lung transplantation in adults.1 2 Despite an
association with smoking and environmental
exposures, the pathogenesis of this disease
remains elusive.1 Familial IPF, defined by
disease in two or more first-degree relatives,
is estimated to occur in 2–20% of all IPF
cases and can present at earlier ages.1 3
Previous studies investigating genetic pre￾disposition in sporadic and familial pulmon￾ary fibrosis have identified rare mutations in
the gene encoding telomerase (TERT, Gene
ID 7015) and in the surfactant-associated
genes, surfactant protein A2 (SFTPA2, Gene
ID 729238), surfactant protein C (SFTPC,
Gene ID 6440) and the ATP-binding cassette
member A3 (ABCA3, Gene ID 21).4–11
Additionally, a polymorphism (rs35705950)
in the mucin 5B gene (MUC5B, Gene ID
727897) promoter is significantly more preva￾lent in individuals with both sporadic and
familial IPF.12 13 Mutations in SFTPC, ABCA3,
and the thyroid transcription factor gene
(NKX2-1, Gene ID 7080) are associated with
childhood ILD.9 14–19 In studies of individuals
and families with mutations in SFTPC, disease
penetrance varies in severity, age of onset,
KEY MESSAGES
▸ Rare mutations in SFTPA2, SFTPC, (surfactant
proteins) and TERT (telomerase) were found in
individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) but not those with chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease.
▸ Mutations associated with childhood interstitial
lung disease are present in adults with IPF sup￾porting that these mutations predispose to a
spectrum of interstitial lung diseases manifest￾ing at all ages.
▸ Genetic analysis and counselling should be con￾sidered as part of the IPF evaluation.

histopathology and clinical characteristics suggesting that
childhood ILD and IPF in adulthood may be part of the
same spectrum of disease.9 10 18–21
Since no previous studies investigated all of these can￾didate genes simultaneously in IPF, we resequenced
these genes in a cohort of patients with IPF to test the
hypothesis that mutations in the coding regions of these
six genes occur at a higher frequency in IPF than in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or in
population-based cohorts, and to determine if interac￾tions among these genes and the MUC5B promoter poly￾morphism modified disease phenotype.
METHODS
Subject selection
IPF cohort
Individuals with IPF were included if they had a usual
interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on lung explant or
biopsy, or had a clinical diagnosis of IPF validated by the
research team using American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society 2011 criteria.1 Individuals
with non-IPF/UIP idiopathic interstitial pneumonia,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, occupational lung disease,
drug-induced lung disease and connective tissue disorders
were excluded. Recruitment included all individuals with
IPF regardless of race, gender, or age presenting from
2009 to 2012. This cohort included archived DNA samples
acquired through a waiver of consent from patients in the
Washington University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital Adult Lung
Transplant Programme who underwent lung transplant￾ation for IPF (n=105) and prospectively recruited indivi￾duals followed in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical
Care Medicine (n=27) for a total n=132, which was a
sample size of convenience. Clinical data, including demo￾graphic information, age at onset of symptoms and diag￾nosis, family history, smoking history, exposure history and
results from radiological studies and lung biopsies, were
acquired through medical record review.
COPD cohort
Archived DNA samples from individuals with COPD
through the COPD SCCOR Project at Washington
University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital (5 P50 HL084922)
from patients recruited from 2005 to 2011 were used as
a disease-based control. Through permission for sample
sharing, we obtained the DNA and linked de-identified
clinical information including age, gender, race and
smoking history from existing databases through a
waiver of consent. The clinical characteristics of each
cohort are summarised in table 1.
Exome sequencing project database
Data from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP,
version ESP6500SI-V2, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/
EVS/) were used to provide race-stratified, population￾based frequencies of variants in candidate genes
(accessed 1 July 2013).
Gene selection
Based on our hypothesis that childhood ILD and IPF may
be part of a spectrum of disease, we selected genes that
were known at the time we designed the study between
associate with IPF only (SFTPA2 and TERT) and genes
associated with both childhood ILD and IPF (ABCA3,
SFTPC and NKX2-1). Mutations in ABCA3 are expressed
in a recessive manner, while mutations in SFTPA2, SFTPC,
NKX2-1 and TERT are dominantly expressed. The pres￾ence of either one or two copies of the MUC5B promoter
variant is associated with IPF, however, exonic mutations
in MUC5B have not been studied. Therefore, we also
interrogated MUC5B, though the mode of inheritance is
unknown. Although mutations in the telomerase RNA
component gene (TERC, Gene ID 7012) are also asso￾ciated with IPF, the mutations occur in the part of the
gene that encodes the RNA component and we therefore
could not apply our definition of ‘mutation’ based on
alteration in protein function.6 22 23

Sample preparation and sequencing
We performed DNA purification on preserved saliva
samples obtained from the patients with IPF using
Oragene DNA self-collection kits and purification protocol
(DNA Genotek Inc, Kanata, Ontario, Canada). The DNA
from each specimen was quantified using the Qubit
Fluorometer and equimolar amounts of each patient’s
DNA were pooled. Using this pooled DNA, all exons of
ABCA3, MUC5B (except exon 49 due to its large size
(∼11 kb) and the presence of significant repetitive
sequence that prevented standard sequencing approach),
NKX2-1, SFTPA2, SFTPC and TERT were amplified,
approximately 45 kb of sequence per individual. Equal
amounts of amplified product were pooled for next gener￾ation sequencing using the Illumina Genome Analyzer/
MiSeq platform. Negative and positive controls were
inserted into the pooled sample to optimise detection of
rare variants with high specificity and sensitivity.24 25
We used SPLINTER (Short IN/DEL Prediction by
Large deviation Inference and Non-linear True frequency
Estimation by Recursion) to identify rare single nucleotide
variants and small insertions/deletions.25 We defined a
mutation as a small insertion or deletion or a non￾synonymous single nucleotide variant previously identified
in children or adults with respiratory disease and/or pre￾dicted to disrupt encoded protein function in at least 2 of
3 prediction algorithms: SIFT, PolyPhen2, or Mutation
Taster.26–28 Since IPF is a rare disease, we excluded variants
with a prevalence of >1% in the general population as cat￾alogued in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP,
version ESP6500SI-V2, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/
EVS/ (accessed July 1, 2013)). We then validated using an
independent genotyping strategy through Sanger rese￾quencing or Taqman Genotyping Assays. Taqman genotyp￾ing was also used for the MUC5B promoter polymorphism.
The validation of variants allowed us to confirm the fre￾quency of each variant and to link it to an individual.
Data analysis
Study data were collected and managed using REDCap
electronic data capture tools hosted at Washington
University School of Medicine’s Institute for Clinical and
Translational Studies.29 Since it is unlikely that an indi￾vidual carries more than one rare mutation at a single
gene locus, the number of mutations in a single gene
can be collapsed for statistical purposes and compared
using a univariate test.30 We used Fisher’s Exact tests to
compare frequencies of individual variants and col￾lapsed frequencies across a gene, and to test the differ￾ence of other categorical features (gender, race, tobacco
use). We used t tests to test the difference in age of
onset between mutated and non-mutated IPF samples.
RESULTS
Mutations in IPF-associated and childhood
ILD-associated genes
In the IPF population, we found 15 mutations in 14 dif￾ferent individuals in all the genes interrogated except
NKX2-1. There were no differences in age of onset, sex
or tobacco use in the IPF individuals with or without a
mutation (table 2). No individuals had single rare muta￾tions in two different genes, although one individual was
homozygous for ABCA3 p.E292V. There was one muta￾tion found in SFTPA2 in the IPF cohort and none in the
COPD cohort but the collapsed frequency was not statis￾tically significant (table 3).
All mutations in IPF and COPD cohorts were found
only in individuals of European descent, so the analyses
in table 3 focused on this subset. Mutations in SFTPC
were found only in the IPF cohort and included the
common disease-causing allele p.I73T as well as two
other mutations (p.L110R and p.A112T) previously
identified in children with ILD but not in adults with
IPF (table 3, unpublished data A Hamvas and L M
Nogee, 2014).15 None of the SFTPC mutations was
present in individuals with COPD or in the ESP data￾base. The collapsed frequency of SFTPC mutations in
the IPF cohort was statistically significant when com￾pared to the COPD cohort.
Rare mutations in TERT were also present in the IPF
cohort and not found in COPD. The collapsed fre￾quency of TERT mutations in the IPF cohort was statis￾tically greater than that of the COPD cohort (table 3).
To determine if the individuals in the IPF and COPD
cohorts were representative of the general population, we
also examined the frequencies of common variants in
these genes. Although none of these common variants
are predicted to be deleterious, we cannot exclude the
possibility that some of these variants could be in linkage
with our functional mutations, but our sequencing meth￾odology did not permit identifying on which allele these

variants resided. The common non-synonymous variants
in SFTPC (p.T138N and p.S186N) and SFTPA2 (p.A91P)
were present in similar frequencies in the IPF and COPD
cohorts compared to the general population, as were the
common synonymous variants in ABCA3 (p.F353F, p.
P585P and p.S1372S) (see online supplementary table
S1). The frequency of SFTPA2 p.Q223K was less than the
ESP frequency, which could be due to sample size. The
frequencies of the common TERT variant p.A279T, previ￾ously associated with aplastic anaemia, were similar in IPF
and COPD cohorts and lower than the 3% population￾based frequency in the ESP, suggesting that this mutation
is not contributing to pulmonary disease (see online sup￾plementary table S1).18
Familial IPF
Of the 132 individuals in the IPF cohort, 26 (20%)
reported a family history of IPF. In those 26 individuals,
only 3 (12%) had a mutation identified in one of the 6
genes, one each in SFTPA2, SFTPC and TERT. The
remaining 23 individuals (88%) did not have a mutation
in any of these candidate genes that explained their
family history.
Interestingly, the other 11 individuals in the IPF cohort
with an identified mutation did not have a family history
of IPF, suggesting (1) that the mutations were spontan￾eous in these individuals, (2) the mutations were inher￾ited but not penetrant in the parent, (3) in the case of
novel mutations, they were not disease causing or (4)
family history of pulmonary fibrosis had not been fully
ascertained or recognised through family member recall.
Mutations in MUC5B
Collapsed frequencies of rare coding region mutations
in MUC5B were similar in the IPF and COPD cohorts
and in the ESP database. Consequently, mutations in the
coding sequence did not appear to be associated with
attributable risk for IPF and were analysed separately
from mutations in the other genes (table 4).
Interestingly, p.V5436M was significantly under￾represented in the IPF cohort (p=0.002), but the clin￾ical significance, if any, of this observation is unclear
(see online supplementary table S1).
We also tested both cohorts for the previously
reported IPF-associated MUC5B promoter polymorphism
(rs35705950; table 5). The 28% minor allele frequency
(MAF) in our IPF cohort is significantly greater than the
MAF in either the COPD cohort (13%, p<0.001) or the
previously reported population-based frequency of 9%,
p<0.001.12 31 The similar prevalence of the rs35705950
polymorphism in individuals with or without mutations
in the other six genes studied in either cohort (p=1.0)
suggests that the polymorphism does not interact with
mutations in these genes to modify disease penetrance
(table 5, online supplementary table S2). However, the
small sample size of this study limits the ability to truly
detect interactions.

DISCUSSION
We demonstrated that previously described rare, domin￾antly expressed mutations in SFTPC, SFTPA2 and TERT
occur in patients with sporadic and familial IPF.4–10
However, our study is the first in which all genes asso￾ciated with both IPF and/or childhood ILD were rese￾quenced simultaneously in a cohort of individuals with
both sporadic and familial IPF. The lack of mutations in
more than one gene in each individual suggests that
interactions among these genes do not contribute sig￾nificantly to disease expression, although significantly
larger cohorts are necessary to confirm this preliminary
observation and possibly identify further rare variants.
Furthermore, recently published genome-wide associ￾ation studies have identified other candidate loci asso￾ciated with increased risk of IPF and should be
interrogated in future studies but had not been identi￾fied at the time that gene selection for this study
occurred.13 32
In this study, 14 (11%) of the individuals in the IPF
cohort had mutations in IPF-associated genes. This fre￾quency may be either overestimated or underestimated
based on our definition of a ‘mutation’ which relied on
a previous association of the gene with disease, or com￾putationally predicted effects on protein function. We
used a stringent definition for altered function by
requiring that 2 of 3 algorithms predicted functionality.
However, only testing in a relevant model system and
replication in an independent cohort can confirm the
functional significance of these mutations. Additionally,
our IPF cohort was weighted toward individuals who
were referred for lung transplantation which could bias
towards younger individuals, and thus, could also be
enriching the cohort for genetically-based disease. The
significant gender difference between the IPF and
COPD cohorts is consistent with the demographics of
each disease and mutations were identified in indivi￾duals of both genders in each cohort but any possible
gender affect on rare variant discovery would have to be
investigated with a larger patient population.
IPF and childhood ILD-associated genes
Surfactant-associated genes
As anticipated from other studies, we found mutations in
SFTPC in one individual with familial IPF (4%) and four
individuals with sporadic IPF (4%). Previous studies have
demonstrated the prevalence of SFTPC mutations to be as
high as 25% in familial pulmonary fibrosis (without a dis￾tinction from IPF, specifically) and as low as 0.7% in spor￾adic IPF.7 8 The SFTPC mutations identified in our cohort
have previously been identified in children and adults with
ILD and/or IPF. Two of these mutations, p.I73T and p.
L110R, result in aberrant prosurfactant protein C protein
products in vitro.33 Since we did not find any mutations in
SFTPC in the COPD cohort, and they are not present in
the general population, this enrichment in the IPF cohort

further strengthens the evidence that these dominantly
expressed mutations are disease-causing and demonstrates
that even ‘sporadic’ IPF may have a genetic basis due to
spontaneous mutation.
Dominant mutations in SFTPA2 have been identified
in kindreds with familial IPF and lung cancer.4 In our
study, p.V178M was present in one individual with famil￾ial IPF and was seen only once in ESP. However, no
other affected family members in this kindred were avail￾able to determine if this mutation segregates with
disease, so it is difficult to determine if this mutation is
disease-causing.
Homozygous recessive or compound heterozygous
ABCA3 mutations cause neonatal respiratory failure and
childhood ILD, and single ABCA3 mutations (p.E292V
and p.D123N) interacting with SFTPC p.I73T have been
reported in two families, one with childhood ILD and
one with IPF.10 34 Our identification of one individual
who was homozygous for ABCA3 p.E292V adds to the
recent identification of a kindred with pulmonary fibro￾sis due to a p.G964D thus further supporting the possi￾bility that adult-onset fibrotic lung disease due to
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
ABCA3 may occur.
11 In contrast to our previous study
that demonstrated an enrichment of single ABCA3 muta￾tions in newborns with RDS, suggesting a developmental
interaction that increased risk or severity of disease, we
did not find the frequency of single ABCA3 mutations in
the IPF cohort to be greater than the 3–5% in the
general population. This is consistent with a prior study
showing single E292V mutations were not a major risk
factor for pulmonary disease in the general population,
and also suggests that interactions with other modifiers
are less likely to increase risk for disease.35–37
Since mutations in NKX2-1 are extremely rare in the
general population, the lack of identifiable mutations in
NKX2-1 in our IPF and COPD cohorts may simply be a
function of the limited sample size of our cohort, thus
making it difficult to know the true prevalence of
NKX2-1 mutations in patients with IPF.

Previous studies of TERT and the RNA component of
telomerase (TERC) have shown heterozygous mutations
to be present in 8–15% of familial IPF cohorts.6 In our
study population, novel mutations in TERT were only
seen in the IPF cohort, solidifying the link between this
gene and predisposition to IPF. That the p.A279T muta￾tion was present in IPF and COPD cohorts with similar
frequencies makes it unlikely that it contributes directly
to the pathogenesis of IPF. Complex functional assays
will be necessary to identify any mechanisms whereby
these mutations exert an effect.
MUC5B
Since the rs35705950 promoter polymorphism is over￾represented in individuals with IPF, we resequenced all
but the largest exon of MUC5B to determine if
mutations in the coding sequence of the gene might
also associate with IPF. Although we found individual
rare deleterious variants in IPF and COPD cohorts, the
similar collapsed frequencies in both cohorts makes it
unlikely that mutations in coding regions of this gene
contribute appreciably to the risk of IPF.
The MAF of the MUC5B promoter polymorphism was
approximately 30% in our IPF cohort which is similar to
previous reports.12 38 Since this frequency is similar in
patients with IPF with and without other candidate gene
mutations, this polymorphism is not associated with
increased risk for disease in association with the exonic
mutations in ABCA3, SFTPA2, SFTPC or TERT.
CONCLUSION
The presence of childhood ILD-associated gene muta￾tions in adults with IPF supports the hypothesis that these
mutations predispose to a spectrum of fibrotic lung dis￾eases manifesting from infancy to adulthood. Therefore,
it is possible that childhood ILD and adult IPF represent
variable expression of a common underlying gene-based
pathogenic mechanism. While these mutations increase
disease risk, the environmental modifiers that cause
injury, disrupt repair and ultimately result in disease
remain to be identified, along with the full complement
of gene mutations predisposing to fibrotic lung disease.
While possible that exome sequencing may only capture
coding region variants and disregard non-coding ele￾ments of genome leading to an underestimate the
genetic contribution of a gene to IPF, further investiga￾tion of genetic susceptibility to IPF using exome sequen￾cing of affected and unaffected family members could
elucidate not only the relationship between childhood
ILD and adult IPF, but also the unidentified genetic
factors leading to disease expression.
