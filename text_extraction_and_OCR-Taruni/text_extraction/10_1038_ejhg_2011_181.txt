PRACTICAL GENETICS In association with
Alagille syndrome: pathogenesis, diagnosis and
management
Alagille syndrome (ALGS), also known as arteriohepatic dysplasia, is a multisystem disorder due to defects in components of the
Notch signalling pathway, most commonly due to mutation in JAG1 (ALGS type 1), but in a small proportion of cases mutation
in NOTCH2 (ALGS type 2). The main clinical and pathological features are chronic cholestasis due to paucity of intrahepatic
bile ducts, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, minor vertebral segmentation anomalies, characteristic facies, posterior
embryotoxon/anterior segment abnormalities, pigmentary retinopathy, and dysplastic kidneys. It follows autosomal dominant
inheritance, but reduced penetrance and variable expression are common in this disorder, and somatic/germline mosaicism may
also be relatively frequent. This review discusses the clinical features of ALGS, including long-term complications, the clinical
and molecular diagnosis, and management.
INTRODUCTION
Alagille syndrome (ALGS; OMIM 118450) is a multisystem autosomal
dominant disorder due to defects in the Notch signalling pathway, and
can affect the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes, kidneys, and central nervous
system, and there may be characteristic facial features. It is sometimes
known as Alagille–Watson syndrome, as well as arteriohepatic
dysplasia. Cases were first reported by Alagille et al in 1969,1
subsequently by Watson and Miller in 1973,2 and again by Alagille
et al in 1975,3 leading to the establishment of diagnostic criteria. The
prevalence is reported to be 1:70 000, based on the presence of
neonatal liver disease,4 but this is almost certainly a significant
underestimate, because it does not take into account the variability
and reduced penetrance of the condition, which became clear through
family studies and the advent of genetic testing. The majority of cases
(B97%) are caused by haploinsufficiency of the JAG1 gene5,6 on
20p11.2-20p12 (encoding JAGGED1), either due to mutations (the
large majority) or deletions at the locus. A small percentage (o1%) are
caused by mutations in NOTCH2,
7 in which group renal malformations
may be more common. New mutations occur commonly (B60%),
and the rate of germline mosaicism may also be relatively high.
Both genes are components of the Notch signalling pathway.
CLINICAL OVERVIEW
Following the early delineation of ALGS cases were essentially ascer￾tained through neonatal liver disease with conjugated hyperbilirubi￾naemia; indeed, the condition was more or less defined by this early
presentation. In due course, the so-called ‘Classic Criteria’ (Table 1),
based on the five main systems involved, were established.8 These are:
cholestasis due to bile duct paucity, congenital heart disease (most
commonly peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis), the face (mild, but

In brief
(1) Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a complex autosomal
dominant disorder due to defects in the Notch signalling
pathway.
(2) The main body systems involved are the liver, heart, skele￾ton, face and eyes, but penetrance is variable, both within
and between families.
(3) The main clinical features and malformations are
chronic cholestasis due to paucity of intrahepatic bile
ducts, congenital heart disease primarily affecting the
pulmonary outflow tract and vasculature, butterfly
vertebrae, characteristic facies with a broad forehead,
posterior embryotoxon and/or anterior segment
abnormalities of the eyes, and pigmentary retinopathy.
Additional features are intracranial bleeding and dysplastic
kidneys.
(4) The diagnosis is essentially clinical, dominated by the con￾sequences of bile duct paucity – chronic cholestasis – and
congenital heart disease.
(5) Almost 90% of cases are due to mutations in JAG1 (20p12),
an additional 5–7% are due to deletions incorporating JAG1,
and about 1% is due to mutations in NOTCH2 (1p13).
ALGS may be referred to as type 1 (JAG1-associated) or type
2 (NOTCH2-associated).
(6) Genetic counselling for autosomal dominant inheritance
must take account of variable expression, reduced pene￾trance and the possibility of germline mosaicism.
(7) Therapy is focused on the consequences of liver disease, as
well as the surgical and medical treatment of congenital
heart defects.
(8) The natural history and morbidity is related to the involve￾ment, or otherwise, of various organ systems, especially the
liver and heart.

recognisable dysmorphic features), the skeleton (abnormal vertebral
segmentation, most commonly in the form of butterfly vertebrae), and
the eye (anterior chamber defects, most commonly posterior embry￾otoxon). It was held that a diagnosis in a proband was sustainable if
bile duct paucity was accompanied by three of the five main criteria.
However, before the molecular genetic testing, variable expression was
determined through segregation analysis,9 and it was suggested that
the presence of only one feature was sufficient to make the diagnosis in
the extended family.
A wide variety of clinical features and manifestations are now
recognised in ALGS.
Liver disease
Chronic cholestasis occurs in a very high proportion (B95%) of
cases,10 and most commonly, presents in the neonatal period or first 3
months of life, with jaundice due to conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
Serum bile acids and liver function tests are raised, pruritus and
growth failure may occur, and xanthomas may be present. A liver
biopsy, no longer mandatory if cholestasis is present, typically shows
paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts, though in the newborn ductal
proliferation may occasionally be seen, usually with portal inflamma￾tion, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of biliary atresia. This is
important, because biliary atresia patients may undergo the Kasai
procedure, which is not beneficial in ALGS.11 Bile duct paucity
appears to be progressive, and may be more common in late infancy
and early childhood compared with early infancy. Where serial liver
biopsies have been performed, bile duct paucity was present in 60% of
infants less than 6 months old, and in 95% after 6 months. Progressive
liver disease, eventually causing cirrhosis and failure, and requiring
liver transplantation, occurs in approximately 15% of cases.10
Although there is no reliable way of predicting which infants are at
high risk, those who subsequently manifest progressive liver disease
have been shown to have chronically elevated total bilirubin, con￾jugated bilirubin, and cholesterol.12 A small proportion of patients
have no manifestations of liver disease.13,14
Heart disease
There is evidence of cardiovascular anomalies in more than 90% of
ALGS subjects.15 Involvement of the pulmonary outflow tract is the
most common type of congenital heart disease, with some form of
peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) affecting at least two-thirds of
cases.10,15 Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common complex
structural anomaly, occurring in up to 16% of cases.10,15 Other
malformations include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect,
aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta, and hypoplastic left heart
syndrome has been reported in one patient with a 20p12 deletion.16
Congenital heart disease may be the sole manifestation of ALGS, if the
condition is defined by a positive genotype. JAG1 mutations have been
found in families with several generations of PPS but no liver disease,
and in screening cell lines of patients with apparently isolated TOF, 7%
were found to have mutations in JAG1.
13 The presence of complex
congenital heart disease appears to be the most significant indicator of
early mortality, probably because it is usually associated with PPS,
whereas hepatic complications account for a significant proportion of
later deaths.
Ophthalmic features
Posterior embryotoxon, the most common ophthalmic feature of
ALGS, has been reported in up to 90% of patients.17 This is
prominence of the centrally positioned Schwalbe’s ring (or line) at
the point where the corneal endothelium and the uveal trabecular
meshwork join (Figure 1). However, this also occurs in up to 15% of
the normal population, as well as nearly 70% of patients with deletion
22q11 syndrome.18 A wide variety of ophthalmic abnormalities may be
seen in ALGS affecting the cornea, iris, retina, and optic disk. Axenfeld
anomaly, a prominent Schwalbe’s ring with attached iris strands, is
seen in 13% of ALGS patients, an unusual mosaic pattern of iris
stromal hypoplasia,19 microcornea, keratoconus, congenital macular
dystrophy, shallow anterior chamber, exotropia, band keratopathy, and
cataracts. Diffuse hypopigmentation of the retinal fundus may occur
in up to 57% of patients, but speckling of the retinal pigment
epithelium in 33%, and optic disc abnormalities in 76%. Nischal
et al20 found evidence of optic disk drusen in at least one eye in 95%
of patients, and bilateral in 80% (but not in liver disease patients
without ALGS). Generally speaking, visual prognosis is good.
Skeletal anomalies
A characteristic form of segmentation anomaly known as ‘butterfly’
vertebrae (Figure 2) may occur in at least 80% of cases.21 This
consists of a sagittal cleft in one or more thoracic vertebrae, visible

on antero-posterior radiograph, and is due to failure of fusion of the
anterior vertebral arches. Vertebral segmentation anomalies occur in a
wide range of disorders22 but, with the exception of deletion 22q11
syndrome (again), the relatively symmetrical ‘butterfly’ appearance is
unusual. These are of no structural significance, and may not be noticed
in a sick infant for whom all the medical care is focused on treating
congenital heart disease, for example. Other axial skeletal features
include narrowing of the interpedicular distance in the lumbar spine,
pointed anterior process of C1, spina bifida occulta and
fusion of adjacent vertebrae, hemivertebrae, and absence of the 12th
rib.23,24 Craniosynostosis has been reported,25 as well as radioulnar
synostosis,26 and the digits may show shortening of the distal phalanges
with fingers that have a fusiform appearance (Figure 3). It is not unusual
for ALGS patients to develop metabolic bone disease with osteoporosis
and fractures, most likely a consequence of multi-organ involvement,
and a sub-optimal nutritional state. A recent retrospective survey of
ALGS families highlighted fractures in 28% of 42 subjects with a mean
age of 5 years, affecting the lower limb long bones in 70%.27
The face
It is well reported that children with ALGS have mild but recognisable
dysmorphic features including a prominent forehead, deep-set eyes
with moderate hypertelorism, upslanting palpebral fissures, depressed
nasal bridge, straight nose with a bulbous tip, large ears, prominent
mandible, and pointed chin.28 In some children, the shape of the face
is strikingly triangular. The prominence of the forehead is said to be
less noticeable by adult life, whereas protrusion of the mandible and
chin is more obvious. In this review, we put forward the opinion that
the facial phenotype differs according to whether the eyes are deep-set
or not. Figure 4 shows two young people with fairly deep-set eyes, but
the palpebral fissures are not obviously upslanting, and there is no
definite impression of hypertelorism. Figure 5, however, shows two
children and an older person with obvious upslanting and narrow
palpebral fissures, their eyes are not deep-set, and they appear to have
hypertelorism. We argue that the overall gestalt differs on the basis of
the eyes, but there are overlapping features, and both faces are
recognisable.
Vascular events
Vascular accidents have been reported to occur in up to 15% of
cases,10 and were a cause of death in 34% in one series.29 Intracranial
bleeding may occur as a consequence of relatively minor head trauma.
Studies have identified anomalies of the basilar, carotid, and middle
cerebral arteries,29,30 and renovascular anomalies, middle aortic
syndrome, and Moyamoya syndrome have all been reported. The
vascular aspects of ALGS are considered further in the next section.

Renal anomalies
Structural problems such as small, echogenic kidneys, cysts, and
ureteropelvic obstruction all occur in ALGS.10 There may also be a
functional abnormality, particularly renal tubular acidosis, which may
occur in up to 74% of cases.10 The first reports of NOTCH2-associated
ALGS7 suggested that renal abnormalities may occur more frequently
in ALGS type 2 compared with type 1, but further data is required.
Growth
Significant growth retardation occurs in a high proportion of sub￾jects.10,31 Malabsorption, leading to failure to thrive, and malnutrition
is likely to be the main cause, but there may be limitations to growth
potential regardless of nutritional status.32 Hypothyroidism has been
described in some ALGS patients, and delayed puberty can occur.
Growth hormone insensitivity has also been reported in children,33
and there are, therefore, a number of possible reasons to explain short
stature in ALGS.
The pancreas
Pancreatic insufficiency appears to occur in a proportion of patients,
perhaps up to 40%,10,34 but assessment is complicated by the presence
of bile duct paucity, which has traditionally been considered to be the
cause of steatorrhea. However, oral pancreatic supplementation has
been beneficial, and some patients have developed insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus.
Learning difficulties
Early studies highlighted a relatively high frequency of mental retarda￾tion,8 but this may have represented ascertainment bias. With aggres￾sive treatment, learning difficulties may be no more common than the
general population, though there appears to be an increased frequency
of motor delay, affecting some 16%. Learning difficulties are more
likely in those cases due to relatively large cytogenetic deletions
encompassing chromosome 20p12.
PATHOGENESIS
Paucity of bile ducts was essential to the diagnosis of ALGS under the
‘Classic Criteria’ (Table 1), and is still a frequent, key feature (80–90%)
in large series of patients.10,35 A progression to paucity appears to
develop through infancy, accompanied by deterioration in liver func￾tion. However, such progression does not always occur. It is no longer
considered likely that there is a failure of development of interlobular
bile ducts, and the factors leading to a decreased number of ducts are
poorly understood. The full role of the JAG1 protein in the develop￾ment of new ducts in infancy is not yet clear. A reduction in the
number of portal tracts has been reported,36 and ductular prolifera￾tion has been seen in a small number of infants with ALGS. The
reasons for these differences are not clear.
The widely variable phenotype in ALGS raises questions about the
primary role of the genotype in giving rise to features, or whether at
least some of the effects are secondary to medical complications.
Debate has taken place about the possibility that the distinctive facies
is not a primary malformation, but secondary to the consequences of
cholestasis.37 However, a panel of dysmorphologists was readily able to
distinguish patients with ALGS from those with other forms of
cholestasis,38 thus strongly suggesting a primary effect of the genotype.
A more substantial consideration relates to the possibility that ALGS is
primarily a vasculopathy. The vascular anomalies of ALGS are wide￾spread,29 prompting the notion that at least some of the effects are
traceable to abnormalities of angiogenesis and the vascular system.
There is evidence that the formation of mature tubular bile ducts
follows on from development of the intrahepatic arterial network.39
However, more fundamentally, the genes implicated in ALGS, JAG1
and NOTCH2, are components of the Notch signalling pathway,
which has a major role in angiogenesis.
JAG1 gene
JAG1 is implicated in the large majority of cases of ALGS, and the gene
is not implicated in any other phenotype. Mutations were identified in
ALGS patients by two groups.5,6 It consists of 26 exons, and encodes
the JAGGED1 cell surface protein that functions as a ligand for the
Notch receptors, Notch 1, 2, 3, and 4. These receptors are transmem￾brane proteins, and interaction with their ligands triggers a cascade of
intracellular downstream effects that result in transcription of genes
that help determine cell fate and differentiation, for example segmen￾tation boundaries in the presomitic mesoderm. Phenotypes associated
with specific genes include spondylocostal dysostosis (DLL3, MESP2,
LFNG, and HES7), and CADASIL (NOTCH3). The latter is an adult￾onset condition characterised by an arteriopathy, which gives rise to
migraine and strokes. The JAG1 homozygous knockout mouse
demonstrates early lethality from vascular defects,40 as do some
other mice that are homozygously knocked out for Notch pathway
Figure 5 Two children, (a) and (b), and an adult, (c), with ALGS. None of
the three have deep-set eyes, but their palpebral fissures are obviously
upslanting and narrow. They possibly have a degree of hypertelorism.

genes, for example Dll1. It is therefore reasonable to postulate a
vasculogenesis role for JAG1 in humans, though this does not
necessarily explain the features seen in ALGS patients. Interestingly,
the heterozygous mouse knockout for Jag1 manifests ocular abnorm￾alities alone, but the mouse that is compound heterozygous for Jag1
and Notch2 mutations resembles the phenotype of ALGS closely.41
In patients with a convincing clinical diagnosis of ALGS, mutations
in JAG1, or deletions encompassing the gene on 20p12, can be
detected in up to 95% of cases. More than 400 JAG1 mutations
have been identified thus far, of which B70% are protein-truncating.
There are no particular hotspots, and any part of the entire coding
region may be involved.42,43 Gene deletions are found in up to 7% of
cases, and there appears to be a critical region of 5.4 Mb, whereby the
phenotype does not differ significantly from mutation cases. However,
larger deletions are likely to be associated with additional problems
such as learning difficulties.44 The occasional finding of a cytogeneti￾cally visible deletion or rearrangement involving 20p12 was significant
in allocating the ALGS locus to this region,9,45 and the similarity of the
phenotype between deletion and mutation cases suggests that haplo￾insufficiency is the mutational mechanism. Approximately 60% of
mutations are de novo, and germline mosaicism may occur at a
frequency up to 8%,46 which must not be overlooked in genetic
counselling, where appropriate.
There is very little evidence for genotype–phenotype correlation for
JAG1 and ALGS. However, the G274D mutation was found to be
segregating with isolated structural heart disease in one family, where
all cases had full or partial forms of TOF.47
NOTCH2 gene
Like JAG1, NOTCH2 is a large gene that comprises 34 exons and
encodes the NOTCH2 transmembrane protein. The fact that mice
compound heterozygotes for Jag1 and Notch2 mutations have a
phenotype that is close to ALGS in humans led to sequencing of the
NOTCH2 gene in cases of ALGS that were negative for mutations in
JAG1. Thus far, only two families with NOTCH2 mutations have been
reported.7 The affected individuals (a total of five in the two families)
had typical features of ALGS, but renal problems were moderately
severe. There is insufficient data at present to look into genotype–
phenotype correlations.
A small proportion of patients fulfilling the classic criteria for ALGS
do not appear to have either a mutation or deletion involving JAG1
or NOTCH2, making further genetic heterogeneity likely. An
‘Alagille-like’ syndrome, following autosomal recessive inheritance,
but not linked either to JAG1 or NOTCH2, has been reported in a
native Canadian family.48 Affected individuals had bile duct paucity,
cholestasis, and pulmonary stenosis.
DIAGNOSIS
ALGS is now defined by its genotype as well as its phenotype, but
significant clinical challenges remain. For example, paucity of bile
ducts, a histological diagnosis from liver biopsy, occurs in a diverse
group of conditions, which, apart from ALGS, include Down
syndrome, cystic fibrosis, congenital infections, alpha-1-antitrypsin
deficiency, and Zellweger and Ivemark syndromes. For none of these
disorders, including ALGS, is bile duct paucity a constant feature and,
as previously discussed, the situation changes over time. The presence
of cholestasis is now considered sufficient, without the need for
routine liver biopsy. Similarly, pulmonary stenosis and related forms
of congenital heart disease occur in isolation and as part of a wide
range of syndromes; for example the disorders of the RAS-MAPK
pathway and deletion 22q11 syndrome. However, PPS is more specific
and should always prompt consideration of ALGS – if the patient does
not have Williams syndrome.
Liver disease and PPS are the most prevalent features seen in
patients with ALGS, but the condition is extremely variable. Kamath
et al14 evaluated 53 mutation-positive relatives of 34 probands with
ALGS. Only 11 (21%) had clinical features that would have unequi￾vocally led to a diagnosis of ALGS; 17 (32%) had mild features of
ALGS after targeted investigation; 25 (47%) did not meet clinical
criteria for ALGS, and 2 of these patients had no features at all. In an
audit of 241 cases referred for ALGS testing at the Exeter Molecular
Genetics Laboratory (UK), JAG1 mutations were identified in 59/135
(44%) probands and 24/106 (23%) of their relatives.49 In probands
with three features of ALGS, mutations were found in 54% of cases,
whereas mutations were found in 34% of those with only one or two
clinical features of ALGS. This audit was dependent on the accuracy of
clinical data supplied by referring clinicians, but overall, the implica￾tions are as follows:
(1) In patients with three features of ALGS, the JAG1 mutation
pick-up rate was not as high as expected;
(2) The mutation-positive pick-up rate was surprisingly high in
those with fewer features of ALGS;
(3) Clinicians should have a high index of clinical suspicion for
ALGS and a low threshold for testing.
The clinical conundrum surrounding ALGS, combined with the advent
of molecular diagnostic testing, led Kamath et al50 to offer revised
diagnostic criteria for ALGS. Here we offer a practical diagnostic
flow chart, depicted in Figure 6. Although Warthen et al51 achieved a

JAG1 mutation detection rate of 94% in a large cohort of clinically
well-defined patients, in routine practice, the pick-up rate will be
significantly lower. Negative JAG1 findings can be expected in up to
B40% of patients suspected to have ALGS,52–56 but the pick-up rate
depends very much on the strictness of the clinical criteria applied to
the testing threshold in probands.
MANAGEMENT
For the patient diagnosed with ALGS, the important evaluations to
undertake, if not already performed in pursuit of a diagnosis, include:
(1) Assessment by a paediatrician/physician/gastroenterologist,
including liver function tests (the conjugated hyperbilirubinae￾mia of ALGS is associated with high GGT levels), serum
cholesterol and triglycerides, bile acids, clotting studies, liver
ultrasound, scintiscan, and biopsy;
(2) Detailed cardiac assessment;
(3) AP spinal X-ray;
(4) Ophthalmic assessment;
(5) Renal ultrasound and renal function tests.
In addition, when the diagnosis is made in infancy or childhood,
monitoring of growth, development, diet and nutritional status, renal
tubular function, and pancreatic function should all be undertaken.
This requires a multidisciplinary approach. Expert dietary input and
supplementary feeding may be necessary.
In the child with significant liver disease, pruritus can be severe, but
successfully treated with choloretic agents such as ursodeoxycholic
acid and cholestyramine, rifampin, or naltrexone. Biliary diversion
may be very helpful, and can be useful before liver transplantation.
In certain cases, partial external biliary diversion has also proved
successful.57 The success of liver transplantation itself is often related
to coexisting cardiac and renal impairment, and these systems must be
very carefully evaluated.58 The 5-year survival following transplanta￾tion is 80%, and results in improvement in liver function and growth
in 90% of cases.59 For live donors from the biological relatives, genetic
testing to rule out gene carrier status should be undertaken, in which
the mutation is known. Contact sports should be avoided if spleno￾magaly is present, and alcohol consumption should not feature at any
age if there is concern about liver function.
The management of cardiac and renal malformations or disease will
follow the practice appropriate to the particular problems encoun￾tered, and similarly for vascular accidents. It is very unlikely that
vertebral anomalies will require any intervention, and the same applies
to most ophthalmic features seen in ALGS.
All efforts should be made to maximise growth potential, which is
compromised in a significant proportion of cases. Careful attention to
nutrition is therefore a key aspect of management, especially in the
symptomatic child. This constitutes the single, most important reason
for ongoing surveillance in the young person. The presence of vascular
anomalies may be made worse by deteriorating liver function that
affects coagulation, which also needs to be monitored. Screening for
vascular anomalies, especially intracranial lesions, may not generate
any benefit for the patient, and this question therefore needs to be
dealt with cautiously and with discernment.
CONCLUSION
The diagnosis of ALGS should not be missed when the patient has
features that meet the Classic Criteria, and investigation, surveillance,
and family management can follow. However, the diagnosis can be
very difficult in a family without an individual who fulfils the Classic
Criteria. ALGS is therefore a condition presenting challenges to clinical
judgment, decisions about genetic testing, and counselling for the
wider family. In general, a high index of clinical suspicion and a low
threshold for genetic testing will help to ensure that most cases are
diagnosed.
