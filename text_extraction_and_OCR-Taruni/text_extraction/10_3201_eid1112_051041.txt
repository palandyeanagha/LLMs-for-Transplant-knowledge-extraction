We investigated a case of hepatitis E acquired after
persons ate wild boar meat. Genotype 3 hepatitis E virus
(HEV) RNA was detected in both patient serum and wild
boar meat. These findings provided direct evidence of
zoonotic foodborne transmission of HEV from a wild boar to
a human.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a causative agent of human
hepatitis E, is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA
virus recently classified as the sole member of the genus
Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae (1,2). HEV is trans￾mitted primarily by the fecal-oral route through contami￾nated drinking water. However, recent studies have
demonstrated that various animal species have serum anti￾bodies to HEV, suggesting that hepatitis E is a zoonotic
disease (3). In Japan, 4 hepatitis E cases have been linked
directly to eating raw deer meat (4), and several cases of
acute hepatitis E have been epidemiologically linked to
eating undercooked pork liver or wild boar meat (5,6).
These cases provide convincing evidence of zoonotic
food-borne HEV transmission. We report direct evidence
of HEV transmission from a wild boar to a human. 
The Study
A 57-year-old woman came to Iizuka Hospital on
March 12, 2005, with malaise and anorexia. Although she
was a healthy hepatitis B virus carrier and negative for
serologic markers of hepatitis A and C, testing upon admis￾sion showed elevated levels of liver enzymes (alanine
aminotranferase 752 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 507
IU/L, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 225U/L). A serum
sample collected on March 16 was positive for both
immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to HEV
when tested by an antibody enzyme-linked immunosor￾bent assay using recombinant viruslike particles (7). This
led to the diagnosis of hepatitis E. The hepatitis was typi￾cal, acute, and self-limiting, and the patient recovered by
the end of March. 
The patient’s husband traditionally hunted boar for
food 3 or 4 times a year, and she had eaten boar meat on 2
occasions. With her husband, she ate the meat as part of a
hot pot on December 28, 2004, 11 weeks before her illness,
and again, grilled, on January 19, 2005, along with 10
other people (including her husband) 8 weeks before her
illness. Disease did not develop in the other 10 people.
Except for this wild boar meat, the patient had not eaten
meat or liver from other wild animals. Since she had not
traveled abroad in the past 30 years, transmission must
have occurred in Japan. Two portions of meat from the
wild boar (meats 1 and 2) eaten on December 28, 2004,
and 1 portion from the other wild boar (meat 3) eaten on
January 19, 2005, remained and were frozen. 
Juice was obtained from the sliced meat by centrifuga￾tion at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was used for
RNA extraction. A nested reverse transcription–poly￾merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to ampli￾fy part of open reading frame 2 (ORF2), which
corresponds to nucleotides (nt) 5939–6297 of the genotype
1 HEV genome (GenBank D10330), with external sense
primer HEV-F1 (5′-TAYCGHAAYCAAGGHTGGCG-3′)
and antisense primer HEV-R2 (5′-TGYTGGTTRTCR￾TARTCCTG-3′). A nested PCR was conducted with inter￾nal sense primer HEV-F2 (5′-GGBGTBGCNGAGGAGG￾AGGC-3′) and internal antisense primer HEV-R1 (5′-
CGACGAAATYAATTCTGTCG-3′). This procedure
allows amplification of HEV 1, 3, and 4 genotypes. A PCR
product of 359 bp including the primer sequences was
obtained from meat 3 by nested PCR. However, meats 1
and 2 were negative. HEV RNA was not detected in the
patient’s serum by the same amplification method. This
may have resulted from an extremely small amount of
RNA.
New primers for the nested RT-PCR were designed for
a region within the 359 base region based on the meat 3
sequences, which corresponded to nt 5983–6243. The first
PCR was performed with external sense primer HEV-WB￾F1 (5′-ACCTCTGGCCTGGTAATGCT-3′) and antisense
primer HEV-WB-R2 (5′-GAGAAGCGTATCAGCAAG￾GT-3′). The nested PCR was performed with internal sense
primer HEV-WB-F2 (5′-TATTCATGGCTCTCCTGTCA￾3′) and internal antisense primer HEV-WB-R1 (5′-ACA￾GTGTCAGAGTAATGCCT-3′). These primers allowed
amplification of 281 nt, including the primer sequences
from the patient serum collected on March 16, 2005. In
contrast, meats 1 and 2 were negative with these new
primers. 
To further analyze the RNA in the patient serum and
meat 3, RNA genomes encoding an entire ORF2 were

amplified as overlapping segments, nucleotide sequences
were determined, and phylogenetic analysis was carried
out with avian HEV as an outgroup. Avian HEV is a
causative agent of chicken hepatitis-splenomegaly syn￾drome (8). Two sequences, 1 from the patient (DQ079629)
and the other from meat 3 (DQ079630), were classified
into genotype 3 (Figure). Only 1 nt difference was
observed in the 1,980 nt of the entire ORF2; the nucleotide
sequence identity was 99.95%. The difference was not
accompanied by any amino acid changes. These data
demonstrated that HEV infection was transmitted from the
wild boar meat to the patient on January 19, 2005. 
Conclusions
Currently, deer, pig, and wild boar are suspected
sources of foodborne zoonotic transmission of HEV in
Japan, and genotypes 3 and 4 of HEV are believed to be
indigenous (4–6,9,10). Direct evidence for transmission of
genotype 3 HEV from animals to humans was observed in
acute hepatitis in 4 persons who had eaten uncooked deer
meat that contained ≈107 copies of HEV RNA (4).
However, the rare finding of HEV antibody-positive deer
in Japan suggest that deer are not the major zoonotic reser￾voir of HEV in this country (11). In contrast, high anti￾body-positive rates in domestic pig and wild boar, includ￾ing HEV genotypes 3 and 4, have been frequently
detected, suggesting that persons who eat uncooked meat
are at risk for infection with HEV (12,13). This report is
the first to provide direct evidence of zoonotic foodborne
genotype 3 HEV transmission from wild boar to a human.
