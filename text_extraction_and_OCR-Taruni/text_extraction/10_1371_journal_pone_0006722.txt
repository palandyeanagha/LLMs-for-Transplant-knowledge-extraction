Abstract
Background: There are no cures or efficacious treatments for severe motor neuron diseases. It is extremely difficult to
obtain naı¨ve spinal motor neurons (sMNs) from human tissues for research due to both technical and ethical reasons.
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are alternative sources. Several methods for MN differentiation have been reported.
However, efficient production of naı¨ve sMNs and culture cost were not taken into consideration in most of the methods.
Methods/Principal Findings: We aimed to establish protocols for efficient production and enrichment of sMNs derived
from pluripotent stem cells. Nestin+ neural stem cell (NSC) clusters were induced by Noggin or a small molecule inhibitor of
BMP signaling. After dissociation of NSC clusters, neurospheres were formed in a floating culture containing FGF2. The
number of NSCs in neurospheres could be expanded more than 30-fold via several passages. More than 33% of HB9+ sMN
progenitor cells were observed after differentiation of dissociated neurospheres by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and a Shh
agonist for another week on monolayer culture. HB9+ sMN progenitor cells were enriched by gradient centrifugation up to
80% purity. These HB9+ cells differentiated into electrophysiologically functional cells and formed synapses with myotubes
during a few weeks after ATRA/SAG treatment.
Conclusions and Significance: The series of procedures we established here, namely neural induction, NSC expansion, sMN
differentiation and sMN purification, can provide large quantities of naı¨ve sMNs derived from human and monkey
pluripotent stem cells. Using small molecule reagents, reduction of culture cost could be achieved.

Introduction
Spinal motor neurons (sMNs) are cells in the central nervous
system (CNS), project their axons outside the CNS and control
muscles directly or indirectly through neuromuscular junctions. It
is well known that differentiation of sMNs is spatio-temporally
controlled in mouse embryonic brain development [1–9]. A
combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and sonic hedgehog
(Shh) would be essential for inducing sMNs from neural stem cells
(NSCs) with proper timing. In vitro sMN differentiation from both
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [10,11] and human embryonic
stem cells (hESCs) [12,13] has been reported by several groups
recently. Mouse ES cell/hESC-derived sMNs could also be a
useful model to investigate the gene regulation pathways and
proteomics in CNS neuronal development.
Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) such as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are progressive
neurological disorders and show severe symptoms in many cases.
Currently there are no cures or efficacious treatments for MNDs.
Transplantation of hESC-derived sMNs is a therapeutic method of
clinical application, however, there are many challenging safety
issues to be overcome. In contrast, generation of MND models could
be useful in basic research for regenerative medicine and
pharmaceutical applications, because ESCs have advantageous
properties such as a uniform genetic background and the ability to
differentiate into all cell types in high quantity and good quality [14].
A large-scale and low-cost culture system is required for research
toward drug discovery and development. Neurosphere culture is a
typical method for enhancing the numbers of brain-derived NSCs
[15] though neurospheres are considered to be a heterogeneous
population of multipotent NSCs and neural progenitor cells [16,17].
Several growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor type 2
(FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), are essential for
proliferation or maintenance of NSCs [18–20]. Although both
mouse and human ESC-derived NSCs could form neurosphere-like
cell aggregates [21,22], it is unknown whether large-scale culture of
neurospheres is feasible for expansion of ESC-derived NSCs and
maintenance of their ability to differentiate.

Small molecular compounds could be useful for constructing
stable and low-cost culture systems. Several compounds have been
reported as antagonists or agonists of intracellular signaling
molecules such as Shh [23], FGF2 [24], or Wnt proteins [25].
Although the specificity of these compounds has been debated, the
running cost can be reduced if the compounds function
appropriately in differentiation of ESCs.
Techniques for isolating cells of interest from a heterogeneous
bulk population are in demand because purity of cell population is
important in many biological assays. Unfortunately, appropriate
specific surface markers have not been identified for sMN sorting.
Although mouse [7,26] and human [27] sMNs could be purified
using enhanced green fluorescence protein driven by a sMN￾specific promoter, the purified sMNs are not already naı¨ve cells
because of ectopic transgene expression. The gradient centrifuga￾tion method has been used to isolate sMNs from embryonic chicks
[28] and embryonic mouse spinal cords [29,30], but there has
been no report on using such method for isolation of human fetus￾or hESC-derived sMNs.
Therefore, in this study we examined the highly efficient
production and enrichment of sMNs derived from hESCs. Human
ESCs were induced to differentiate into NSCs by a bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist, Noggin, or a small
molecular compound, Dorsomorphin, in a monolayer culture
system. These hESC-derived NSCs had rostral characteristics by
default. NSCs differentiated into sMNs in medium containing
ATRA and Shh or SAG, an agonist of Shh. Efficient expansions of
sMNs were also achieved by passagable neurosphere suspension
culture in the presence of FGF2. Moreover, sMNs were highly
purified by gradient centrifugation, though further optimization
was required for much higher efficiency. Using a combination of
the techniques mentioned above, we established highly efficient
sMN production from hESCs. These techniques were also cost￾and time-effective improvements compared with those of previous
reports.
Materials and Methods
Spinal Motor Neuron Induction from Human Embryonic
Stem Cells
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs; KhES-1, KhES-2, and
KhES-3, passage numbers around 30–70) and cynomolgus
monkey ESCs (CMK-6) were obtained from Institute for Frontier
Medical Sciences, Kyoto University and Mitsubishi Tanabe
Pharma Corporation, respectively. The hESCs were treated
according to the guidelines for utilization of hESCs established
by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology, Japan. The procedure for maintenance of hESCs and
monkey ESCs was essentially the same as described previously
[31]. Briefly, hESCs or monkey ESCs were cultured on mitomycin
C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in primate ES medium
(ReproCELL, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 5 ng/ml FGF2
(Wako, Japan). To obtain NSCs or neural progenitor cells derived
from both ESCs, we modified the method of Gerrard et al. [32].
For neural induction, dissociated ES colonies 40–70 mm in
diameter were selected with Cell Strainers (BD-Falcon, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) and plated on poly-L-lysine/laminin (PLL/LM; both
from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) -coated culture dishes in
N2B27 neural differentiation medium (1:1 mix of DMEM/F12
supplemented with N2 and Neurobasal medium supplemented
with B27 [all from Gibco, Gland Island, NY], supplemented with
100 ng/ml mouse or human recombinant Noggin (R&D Systems)
or 200 nM Dorsomorphin (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as
an inhibitor of BMP signaling for the first 10 days. The medium
was changed every two days (P1 in Figure 1A). Primary colonies
were split into small clumps by 200 U/ml Collagenase with 1 mM
CaCl2, plated into new PLL/LM-coated culture dishes and
cultured for another 7 days with N2B27 supplemented with
BMP inhibitors (P2 in Figure 1A). Noggin-treated cells formed
radial clusters, namely neural rosettes in the P2 stage (Figure 1).
For sMN differentiation, P2 cells were dissociated by Accutase
(Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) and cultured
on PLL/LM plus human plasma Fibronectin (Chemicon, Bill￾erica, MA) -coated culture dishes (PL/LM/FN) at 1000 cells/cm2
in N2B27 supplemented with ATRA (Sigma) and either human
recombinant Shh (R&D Systems) or SAG (Alexis, San Diego, CA)
for 7 days, and then cultured in N2B27 containing 10 ng/ml
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; R&D Systems), 10 ng/
ml glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; R&D Systems)
and 10 ng/ml neurotrophin-3 (NT-3; R&D Systems) for another
2 weeks or longer.
Neurosphere Culture
NSCs were dissociated at the end of P2 and cultured at
106 cells/ml with N2B27 in the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF2 and
50 ng/ml heparin (Sigma) for 2 weeks or longer. Neurospheres
were collected by gentle centrifugation and incubated with
Accutase for 10 minutes at 37uC. Cells were dissociated by 1 ml
micropipette and washed with N2B27 medium to remove residual
enzymes. Neurospheres were passaged several times in N2B27
with both FGF2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&D
Systems).
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT) and were
permeabilized by 0.5% Triton-X (Wako Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan)
for 5 minutes at RT. Primary antibodies used in this study
included polyclonal antibodies against Nestin (1:200; Chemicon),
Sox1 (1:200; Sigma), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (1:100;
Chemicon), Synapsin (1:200; Chemicon), bIII-tubulin (1:200;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA), GFAP (1:400; DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark), and Desmin (1:200; Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA) or monoclonal antibodies against Oct4 (1:200; Santa Cruz,
Santa Cruz, CA), bIII-tubulin (1:200; Sigma), Nestin (1:200;
Chemicon), Olig2 (1:200; IBL, Takasaki, Japan), MNR2 (HB9,
1:5), Isl1 (1:5; DSHB, Iowa City, IA), BF-1 (1:400; Affinity
BioReagents, Golden, CO), and AFP (1:200; Sigma).
As secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G
Alexa Fluor 488 and 568, and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488
and 568 (all at 1:1000; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) were
used. Cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylin￾dole (DAPI, Sigma) for visualization of all nuclei. Image
acquisition was performed using an inverted Olympus IX71
epifluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) using single-channel acquisition on an Olympus
DP70 CCD camera with DP software version 2.1,1.83 (Olympus).
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Tokyo,
Japan). Two micrograms of total RNA were used to synthesize
cDNA in 20 ml reaction scales by High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). An
appropriate reaction volume (0.5 ml) was used for quantitative
PCR (qtPCR) with SYBR Green Master Mix on a 7500 Real-time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression levels
were determined with the comparative CT method in triplicate
experiments. Primers used in this study are listed in Table S1.

Purification of Motor Neurons by Gradient Centrifugation
To purify ESC-derived sMNs, we applied the procedure of
Gingras et al. [29] with slight modification. sMNs were
enzymatically dissociated by Accutase and washed with N2B27
once by centrifugation, and were resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM/
F12 containing 0.004% DNaseI (Sigma Aldrich). The gradient
reagent, Biocoll (Biochrom AG, Germany), was diluted to 1:1.76
with L15 medium (Gibco) and 4 ml was put into 15 ml conical
tubes (BD-Falcon). Cell suspension was gently placed over the
gradient reagent. Schematic drawings of the overlays are shown in
Figure S7A. After centrifugation of 5006g for 20 min at 4uC, cells
at interfaces between gradients were collected and dissolved in
N2B27 medium, and then cultured at an appropriate cell density
with growth factors. After overnight culture, cells were fixed for
measurement of sMN enrichment.
ENStem-A Culture
H9 hESC-derived neural progenitor cells (ENStem-ATM) were
obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). ENStem-A cells were
expanded according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To form
neurospheres, ENStem-A cells were cultivated in N2B27 medium
containing 10 ng/ml FGF2 for 7 days at 10,000 cells/ml.
Neurospheres were dissociated by Accutase and then plated on
PLL/LM-coated dishes in N2B27 medium containing 10 mM
ATRA and 10 nM SAG. The medium was changed every 3 days.
After 2 weeks, cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry analysis.
Patch-Clamp Recordings
Human ESC-derived sMNs, cultured for 14 days after ATRA/
SAG treatment, were used for electrophysiological analysis. An
HEKA EPC10 amplifier was used for recording of data in a
whole-cell patch clamp configuration (HEKA Instruments Inc,
Bellmore, NY). An external solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM
glucose) was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. A pipette solution
(147 mM CsCl, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM ATP-Mg, and 10 mM
HEPES) was adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. Intracellular current
injections were delivered via a recording pipette in whole-cell
current-clamp recordings. The duration of the current pulse was 1
second, and the amplitude was 50 pA. In whole-cell voltage-clamp
recordings of glutamate application experiments, sMNs were
perfused with the external solution in the presence of 100 mM
glutamate for 20 seconds. The current-voltage relationship was
obtained by holding the membrane potential at 260 mV and then
delivering a depolarizing pulse for 500 ms in a stepwise manner
with 10-mV increments from 260 mV to 40 mV.
Co-Culture Experiments with Skeletal Muscle Cells
Undifferentiated mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were maintained
in DMEM with 20% FBS. Co-culture procedures were carried our
according to the previous report [33]. C2C12 cells were
differentiated in DMEM with 2% horse serum (Sigma) for 4 days.
C2C12-derived myotubes were co-cultured with hESC-derived
sMNs in N2B27 medium for 4 to 10 days. Immunocytochemistry
were performed with anti-synapsin antibodies and Alexa Fluor
594-conjugated a-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes).
Results
Highly Efficient Neural Induction from Human Embryonic
Stem Cells
The procedure for sMN differentiation from hESCs is
schematically summarized in Figure 1A. As a first stage, NSCs
were induced from KhES-1 (K1) hESCs with Noggin as described
in Materials and Methods. After 10 days, neuroectodermal marker
Nestin-positive-cell colonies were observed with high frequency
(Figure 1B). In contrast, Desmin+ mesodermal or Alfa-fetoprotein
(AFP)+ endodermal cells were not detected in K1-derived cell
colonies (Figure 1B) but some positive cells were observed in K2-
and K3-derived colonies (Figure S2A and C). Neuroectodermal
cell colonies were dissociated by Collagenase and replated on
PLL/LM-coated culture dishes for 7 days (total 17 days after
neural induction). Nestin+ neural rosettes (NRs) emerged within 7
days after replating (Figure 1C). Strong AFP expression was still
observed in some K2 and K3 colonies at the P2 stage but very
weak AFP expression was detected in only a few K1 colonies
(Figure 1C, Figure S2B and D). None or very few of either
Desmin+ or Oct4+ colonies were observed in the culture of the
three hESC lines (Figure 1C, Figure S2B and D). NR colonies in
K1 hESCs were more compact than in the other two lines
(Figure 1C, Figure S2B and D). Nestin+ neuroectoderm cells were
also induced from monkey ESCs by Noggin (Figure 1F and G).
Furthermore, we checked that immunostaining of Nestin was
specific to neural stem cells because Nestin was expressed in some
non-neural cells such as satellite cells [34]. Nestin+ cells at P2 did
not express other differentiation markers, such as Oct4, Desmin,
and AFP, while another neuroepithelial marker, Sox1 was
expressed in Nestin+ cells (Figure S1). These results suggest that
the immunostaining of Nestin was specific to neuroectodermal
cells.
Recently, Dorsomorphin (DSM), a chemical inhibitor of BMP
signaling, was used instead of Noggin for inducing myocardial
differentiation in mouse ESCs [35]. Hence, we examined whether
DSM was effective in neural induction of hESCs. K1 hESCs were
cultured in N2B27 with 200 nM DSM in the same manner as
Noggin treatment. DSM-treated K1 hESCs showed similar results
in neural induction as those observed in Noggin-treated cultures
(Figure 1D and E). These data indicated that the BMP inhibitor,
DSM, could replace Noggin as a neural inducer.
Differentiation of hESC-derived NSCs into Spinal Motor
Neurons
We thus chose the K1 hESC line for sMN differentiation
because it showed the most effective neural induction by Noggin
among the three hESC lines (Figure 1 and Figure S2). Dissociated
NR colonies from either hESCs or monkey ESCs were plated on
PLL/LM with Fibronectin (PLL/LM/FN)-coated dishes in
N2B27 medium containing ATRA and Shh. Culture condition
with 1 mM ATRA and 500 ng/ml Shh promoted cell proliferation
more than did control culture (Figure 2A–H). Larger numbers of
HB9+ or Isl1+ sMNs were observed in ATRA/Shh-treated culture
at 7 days (Figure 2B, D, F, H, I and J). In contrast, very few HB9+
and Isl1+ cells were observed in control culture (Figure 2A, C, E,
G, I and J). Higher concentration of ATRA (5 mM) had no effect
on raising HB9+ or Isl1+ cell numbers in either hESC or monkey
ESC-derived NSCs (Figure 2I and J).
We next examined whether regional characters were altered
after ATRA/Shh treatment. BF1 is a rostral brain marker. Large
numbers of BF1+ cells, but no HB9+ sMNs, were observed in
control culture (Figure 3A, C and E). Conversely, many HB9+
cells, but no BF+ cells, were observed in ATRA/Shh-treated
culture (Figure 3B, D and E). Similar results were observed in
monkey ESC differentiation culture (Figure S3C). These findings
suggested that neurons derived from NRs were characteristic of
the rostral brain as a default state and that ATRA/Shh-treatment
strongly changed the properties of neurons from the rostral brain
to the caudal spinal cord.
Naı¨ve sMN Enrichment from hESC
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6722

The gene expression levels of sMN markers such as HB9, Isl1
and Olig2 were upregulated 1.3-, 8.5- and 5.2-fold, respectively,
by ATRA/Shh treatment (Figure 4A–C), and also a caudal brain
marker, HoxB4, was drastically upregulated (Figure 4D). Similar
results were obtained in monkey ESCs (Figure S4). On the other
hand, BF1 expression level was downregulated by ATRA/Shh
treatment (Figure 4E). These qtPCR results indicated that ATRA/
Shh strongly induced sMN markers including spinal cord markers
but repressed a rostral brain marker. No significant difference in
the expression level of bIII-tubulin suggested that neurogenesis
itself was not changed by ATRA/Shh (Figure 4F).
The Small Molecule Drug, SAG, Produced More Spinal
Neurons Than Did Shh
As described in the results of DSM, chemical reagents are very
useful for constructing stable culture systems. In the same manner
as DSM, we tried to use a Shh agonist, SAG, instead of
recombinant Shh protein. SAG has been reported to directly
Figure 2. ATRA/Shh Promotes Differentiation to Spinal Cord Motor Neurons. Dissociated NRs, derived from hESCs or monkey ESCs, were
cultured in the presence of ATRA and Shh for 7 days. When 1 mM ATRA and 500 ng/ml Shh were supplemented in the differentiation culture (B, D, F
and H), larger numbers of bIII-tubulin+/HB9+ (B and F) and bIII-tubulin+/Isl1+ cells (D and H) were observed. Insets in A–H show high magnification. (I

inhibit the Smoothened receptor, which is constitutively inhibited
by another Shh receptor, Patched, and activates downstream
signals (Figure S3A) [36]. SAG (10 to 1,000 nM) was added into
dissociated NRs culture with 1 mM ATRA to evaluate sMN
differentiation-inducing activity. Ratios of HB9+ or Isl1+ cells
were not significantly different between SAG-treated and Shh￾treated cultures (Figure 5A). Representative staining using
antibodies against Isl1 and bIII-tubulin is shown in Figure 5B
and Figure S3B. The gene expression levels of sMN-specific genes
(HB9 and Isl1) in ATRA/SAG culture were similar to or much
higher than those in ATRA/Shh culture (Figure 5C and D).
Rostral-caudal genes (HoxB4 and BF1) in ATRA/SAG culture
were expressed in a manner similar to those in ATRA/Shh culture
(Figure 5E and F). The highest concentration of SAG (1000 nM)
did not suppress BF1 expression even in the presence of ATRA
(Figure 5F), possibly because the effect of SAG changed in a dose￾dependent manner [37]. The expression level of bIII-tubulin was
not significantly changed by SAG (Figure 5G), suggesting that
SAG did not affect neurogenesis. These results strongly indicated
that the SAG molecule could be an alternative to Shh in sMN
differentiation. Similar results were obtained in monkey ESCs
(Figure S3C) and also in ENStem-A, H9-derived neural progenitor
cells (Figure S5). These results suggest that our protocol for sMN
differentiation could be applied to ESCs from other species and
even to hESC-derived NSCs induced by different methods,
although there were slightly different responses among a few
hESC lines as described above.
Mature Motor Neurons Are Electrophysiologically
Functional and Form Synapses with Myotubes
ATRA/SAG-treated hESC-derived sMNs were maintained in
N2B27 medium supplemented with BDNF, NT-3, and GDNF for
another 2 weeks or longer. During this culture term, hESC￾derived neurons became sMNs expressing both HB9 and choline
acetyl transferase (ChAT), which is the key enzyme required for
the synthesis of acetylcholine (Figure 6A), suggesting that these
double-positive cells were mature sMNs. Mature sMNs were
further examined for these functions by electrophysiological
analysis. Repetitive firing of action potentials in response to the
injection of a 1-second current pulse (50 pA) was observed by a
voltage clamp (Figure 6B). An inward current in response to the
application of 100 mM glutamate was observed with a voltage
clamp while holding voltage at 260 mV (Figure 6C). A voltage
clamp recording and the current density-voltage relationship
showed inward currents in response to depolarizing voltage steps
from 260 mV to 40 mV (Figure 6C). These data indicated that
mature functional sMNs could be produced from hESCs by our
differentiation protocol.
Furthermore, we examined whether hESC-derived sMNs could
form neuromuscular junctions. hESC-derived sMNs were co￾cultured with mouse C2C12-derived myotubes for 4 to 10 days.
Antibodies against either bIII-tubulin or Synapsin and fluores￾cence-conjugated a-bungarotoxin were used for detecting neuro￾muscular junctions. The signals of a-bungarotoxin were co￾localized with axonal terminals of neurons (Figure 6F and
arrowheads in Figure 6F’) and also detected in myotubes adjacent
to the signals of Synapsin, a neural synaptic marker (arrowheads in
Figure 6G and G’). These data suggest that sMNs derived from
hESCs had an ability to form neuromuscular junctions in vitro.
Efficient sMN Production by Neurosphere Culture
Neurosphere culture is commonly applied to estimate multi￾potency of brain-derived NSCs as well as NSC propagation
[15,38]. In addition, neurosphere culture can be utilized for
expansion of ESC-derived NSCs [33,39]. Therefore, we next
aimed to expand the number of our ESC-derived NSCs by
neurosphere culture in growth factor-containing medium. Primary
neurospheres derived from NRs were cultured in N2B27 medium
containing 20 ng/ml FGF2 (NS-FGF) or both EGF and FGF2
(NS-EGF/FGF) at 100 cells/ml (Figure 7A). After 10 to 14 days,
only a few neurospheres were observed in control N2B27 medium
without growth factors (Figure 7A) and very few neurospheres in
medium containing EGF alone (data not shown), whereas many
neurospheres were formed in NS-FGF and NS-EGF/FGF and the
formation rate showed no significant difference between NS-FGF
and NS-EGF/FGF (Figure 7A). When SU5402, an FGF2 signal￾specific inhibitor was added to neurosphere culture with FGF2-

containing medium, neurosphere formation was completely
suppressed (data not shown). Thus FGF2 was required for
formation of NR-derived neurospheres. In addition, the formation
rate of neurospheres decreased gradually according to the number
of serial passages in both NS-FGF and NS-EGF/FGF (Figure 7A).
There were no morphological differences between NS-FGF and
NS-EGF/FGF (Figure 7B), but we found differences in the
efficiency of sMN differentiation. Cells in both NS-FGF and NS￾EGF/FGF could differentiate into HB9+ sMNs, though neuro￾sphere-mediated HB9+ sMNs decreased gradually each passage
(Figure 7C). However, HB9+ cells from NS-EGF/FGF drastically
decreased after tertial passaging (Figure 7C and D) and rostral
brain marker (BF1)-positive cells increased depending on the
number of passages (Figure 7D). These results suggested that
neurospheres in FGF2-containing media could maintain the
ability to differentiate into HB9+ sMNs through ATRA/Shh
treatment, but EGF in FGF2 condition could not. Using NS-FGF
culture, sMN-producible neurospheres could be expanded. Simple
calculation indicated that cells with a HB9+ differentiation
potential of more than 20% expanded more than 30-fold by three
passages of NS-FGF (Figure 7C). Similar results were obtained
from monkey ES-derived neurospheres (Figure S6). Therefore, the
NS-FGF culture method can stably expand a sMN population.
Furthermore, frozen stocks of NS-FGF could maintain the ability
to proliferate and differentiate into sMNs (data not shown).
Purification of Spinal Motor Neurons by Gradient
Centrifugation
Although our differentiation protocol resulted in highly efficient
differentiation of sMNs, the differentiation efficiency was not
100% and non-sMNs co-existed in the culture. Therefore, we tried
to isolate sMNs from the mixed population of differentiated cells
derived from hESCs. At present, there are no identified cell
surface markers for sMNs, but several reports have described
purification of primary MNs from spinal cords of embryonic chick
[20,28,30], rat [30,40,41], and mouse [29,42,43] using gradient
centrifugation. To purify hESC-derived sMNs with naı¨ve
condition, discontinuous gradients were prepared by overlaying
two different densities of Biocoll and then cells were put onto the
gradient (Figure S7A). After centrifugation, two interfaces were
carefully collected and immunochemistry was carried out. The
results indicated that 78% of cells in interface 2 were HB9-positive
(Table 1), indicating that the gradient centrifugation method
enriched HB9+ sMNs more than 2.5-fold. Almost half of the cell
population recovered in interface 2 (Table 1). In addition, monkey
ESC-derived sMNs were also enriched by the same method,
although results showed a lower recovery ratio (Figure S7B, Table
S2). These data suggested that naı¨ve sMNs could be obtained from
mixtures of hESC/monkey ESC-derived differentiated cells
without any cell surface markers or reporter transgenes.
Discussion
Highly efficient sMN production from hESCs was achieved in
four steps: 1) neural induction by Noggin or DSM, 2) neurosphere
culture of hESC-derived NSCs, 3) sMN differentiation by ATRA/
Shh or ATRA/SAG and 4) sMN purification by gradient
centrifugation. Our protocol could be applied to not only KhES1
hESCs but also H9 hESCs. Although the methods of each step
have been previously reported, we modified the procedures to
improve the efficiency of differentiation and we showed that
combinations of these techniques resulted in a large amount of
naı¨ve sMNs, which could be obtained especially by large-scale
NSC-neurosphere culture and following isolation of the sMN
population by gradient centrifuge. Enriched hESC-derived naı¨ve
sMNs are potentially available for not only tools in drug screening
but also clinical applications for transplantation [44]. Our
combination techniques using ESC-derived sMNs in this study
might be applicable to other types of neural cells in the presence of
proper extrinsic factors [9].
Small Molecular Compounds in Differentiation
Procedures
We showed that small chemical compounds such as DSM or
SAG could replace recombinant proteins as factors necessary for
neural induction or sMN differentiation (Figure 5 and Figure S3).
The effect of DSM or SAG was equal to or greater than that of
recombinant proteins. However, we found some differences
between the immunostaining and the gene expression patterns
(Figure 5A, C and D). Especially, the HB9 mRNA level decreased
at 1,000 nM SAG/1 mM ATRA (Figure 5C), while HB9+ cell
numbers did not change (Figure 5A). Also, the gene expression
Figure 4. ATRA/Shh Induces the Expression of Spinal Cord-Specific and Motor Neuron-Specific Genes. (A–C) The expression of sMN￾specific genes such as HB9, Isl1, and Olig2 was upregulated by the treatment of 1 mM ATRA and 500 ng/ml Shh. (D) A spinal cord-specific gene,
HoxB4, was also upregulated in ATRA/SAG-treated cells compared to the control without ATRA/Shh. In contrast, the rostral brain marker BF1
expression was downregulated in ATRA/Shh-treated culture compared to the control culture (E). (F) There was no statistically significant difference in
the expression levels of the neuronal marker bIII-tubulin between ATRA/Shh culture and the control. The gene expression levels in the control culture
were defined as 1.0.*p,0.05, **p,0.005 (n = 3).

level of Isl1 was up-regulated in SAG dose-dependent manner
(Figure 5D), although Isl1+ cells did not increased (Figure 5A).
There are several reasons for these discrepancies. First, SAG could
act as a Shh inhibitor at high concentration [37,45]. Therefore,
HB9 mRNA level might be down-regulated at high concentration
of SAG (Figure 5C). Second, we speculate that 10 nM SAG is
enough for the production of HB9 and Isl1-positive cells from
almost all of Shh-responsive NSCs and high-dose of SAG
(.100 nM) might up-regulate the gene expression of HB9 or
Isl1 in sMNs (HB9- and Isl1-positive cells) by unknown effect of
SAG. Although there are some unknown mechanisms of SAG, use
of small molecules has several benefits: it can (1) reduce culture
cost and (2) increase culture stability in comparison with the use of
recombinant proteins. Therefore, small molecules are important
for pharmaceutical applications such as drug screenings or safety
tests in high-throughput systems.
Neurosphere Culture for Expansion of ESC-Derived NSCs
In this paper, we showed that NS-FGF produced more HB9+
sMNs than did NS-EGF/FGF (Figure 7). The reasons why
different effects occurred between two culture conditions are
unclear. FGF2 was required for the formation of neurospheres
using ESC-derived NSCs (Figure 7). Previous work has shown that
FGF2 itself functions as a caudalizing factor [46]. Hence, the
caudalization effect of FGF2 might help to maintain the potency of
sMN differentiation of NS-FGF, whereas EGF might cancel the
caudalization effect of FGF2 but not the neurosphere-forming
effect, or simply a high dose of ATRA and Shh might be required
for sMN differentiation from NS-EGF/FGF. BF1+ cells were
detected from quinary NS-EGF/FGF (Figure 7D), but the exact
reasons are uncertain. Therefore, further experiments are required
for revealing reasons for this phenomenon in late passages of
neurosphere culture.
The neurosphere technique we established could expand the
numbers of NSCs more than 30-fold while preserving the potency
of sMN differentiation (Figure 7 and Figure S5). Using this
neurosphere culturing system, a large amount of either NSCs or
sMNs could be prepared in appropriate quality. We are currently
trying to determine culture conditions that increase or maintain
HB9+ differentiation potency because it is necessary to maintain

the potency of HB9+ sMN differentiation for large-scale
experiments. In addition, these neurospheres were cryopreserva￾ble. Cryopreserved neurospheres might lead to much faster and
more efficient sMN production.
Enrichment of Naı¨ve sMNs Derived from ESCs
It is important to purify or enrich particular cells from a mixed
population from hESC-derived culture. Our differentiation method
could produce sMNs with an average ratio of HB9+ cells of 30% in
the total cell population; in other words, there were still other cell
types such as NSCs, ventral interneurons and astrocytes in the cell
culture. Certainly, it is possible to isolate a pure population using
fluorescent reporters driven by a specific promoter or specific cell
surface markers [7,47]. However, no specific surface markers for
sMNs have been reported. Thus, we tried enrichment of hESC￾derived sMNs by gradient centrifugation. Our centrifugation￾protocol raised the purity of sMNs from 30% to 80% at interface
2. Interface 1 contained a moderate ratio of HB9-positive cells, but
the recovery rate was lower. This result suggests that more
optimization is required for our protocol or that HB9-positive cells
in these interfaces might differ from each other. In addition, the
recovery ratio in monkey ESCs was much lower than in hESCs
(Table 1 and Table S2), possibly because of a difference in sensitivity
between dissociation enzymes of these species.
In conclusion, we have combined relatively simple methods and
achieved an improvement in differentiation efficiency, amplifica￾Figure 6. Mature Motor Neurons are Electrophysiologically Functional and Form Synapses with Myotubes. (A) A mature sMN marker,

tion of hESC-derived NSCs and enrichment of hESC-derived
naı¨ve sMNs. Our techniques established here will be applicable for
preparation of cells in large-scale culture systems, which are
required for research toward drug discovery and development. We
also propose that isolated hESC-derived sMNs could be important
materials in both clinical and basic medical research.
Recently, ALS models using hESC-derived MNs have been
reported [48–50]. When hESC-derived MNs were co-cultured
with glial cells expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1),
the number of HB9-positive neurons decreased because of cell
death by astroglial effect, namely, non-cell autonomous effect
[48,49]. On the other hand, another ALS model using mutant
SOD1-transfected MNs showed that the HB9 promoter-driven
mutant SOD1 expression in hESC-derived MNs resulted in a
decrease of MNs, suggesting cell-autonomous neuronal death [50].
Thus, the mechanisms of disease onset and progress are still
controversial. Enriched population of hESC-derived MNs will be
applicable for ALS modeling.
Functional sMNs generated by our protocol might be effective
in applications such as personalized medicine by using cell banks
of hESCs or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).
Patient-specific hiPSCs have been generated previously [51].
Among them, SMA patient’s hiPSCs showed a cell-death
phenotype [52]. Our sMN differentiation protocol will facilitate
the generation of patient-specific hiPSCs for diagnosis of diseases
and investigation of disease mechanisms, as well as drug screening.
Moreover, extensive efforts to develop stem-cell based cell therapy
have been carried out [14,53]. Therefore, functional sMNs
produced from hESCs or hiPSCs by our method will contribute
to therapeutic application for MNDs.
