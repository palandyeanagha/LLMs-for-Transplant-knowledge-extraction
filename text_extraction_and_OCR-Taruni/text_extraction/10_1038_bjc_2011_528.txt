Sir,
The very interesting data presented by Singer et al (2011), on
prevalence of fatigue at three time points, that is, the beginning of
inpatient treatment, at discharge and half a year after diagnosis,
raise some questions and comments. First of all, it is not reported
when fatigue present at the beginning of inpatient treatment
started; that is, fatigue was present weeks, months or years before
the diagnosis of cancer. In other words was fatigue related to the
presence of cancer or was it antecedent, and not related to cancer
presence? In fact, it could be that some patients had a chronic
fatigue present many months or years before the diagnosis of
cancer; and therefore, fatigue could not be due to cancer, but was
already present for a different reason, for example, a chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS). Moreover, it would be very interesting to
know how many of the patients with fatigue half a year after
diagnosis were fatigued years after, obviously in case they were
alive. These questions are based on the fact that in our opinion
there are two types of fatigue in cancer patients needing different
symptom monitoring and management: one that could be defined
as cancer-related fatigue and is that nicely described by Singer and
co-workers, and the other could be defined as CFS-cancer related
and it is observed before diagnosis and after therapy, in both cases
not obviously related to cancer.
In fact, to better understand the different course of fatigue in
cancer patients and in survivors, we need different definitions.
Cancer-related fatigue, necessarily associated with cancer and
its treatments, has to be adopted in patients with active disease,
on treatments, and until 1 year from diagnosis. In this popula￾tion, there are different causes for fatigue, including anaemia,
endocrine and metabolic disorders, cardiovascular and renal
dysfunctions, and this is the condition nicely reported by Singer
and colleagues.
Instead, the chronic and persistent fatigue experienced before
the diagnosis or by long-term cancer survivors is not necessary
related to or caused by cancer and its treatments. These patients
show a particular type of fatigue similarly to the fatigue
experienced by patients affected by CFS, which accordingly to
the CDC case definition (Fukuda et al, 1994) is a severe fatigue
usually associated with impairment in short-term memory or
concentration (severe enough to cause substantial reduction in
previous levels of occupation, educational source or personal
activities); post-exertional malaise lasting 424 h; soar throat;
tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint
pain without joint swelling or redness; headaches of a new type for
pattern or severity; and unrefreshed sleep.
As we have previously suggested (Simonelli et al, 2008), we
believe that, in particular in long-term cancer survivors, fatigue
can be a chronic/persistent condition associated with disrupting
symptoms similar to CFS (Fukuda et al, 1994). For these reasons,
we believe that fatigue in these conditions may be considered a
subtype of CFS and could be defined as CFS-cancer related.
Further studies could be carried out in these settings to better
define these two entities, that is, cancer-related fatigue and
CFS-cancer related.
