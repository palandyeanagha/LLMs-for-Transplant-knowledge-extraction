Patients with gastric variceal bleeding typically are cir￾rhotics and require a multidisciplinary team approach in￾cluding hepatologists, endoscopists, diagnostic radiologists,
and interventional radiologists.1,2 Upper gastrointestinal en￾doscopy is the first-line diagnostic and management tool for
bleeding gastric varices, as it is in all upper gastrointestinal
bleeds.1,2 Traditionally, in the United States when endoscopy

Abstract Patients with gastric variceal bleeding require a multidisciplinary team approach
including hepatologists, endoscopists, diagnostic radiologists, and interventional
radiologists. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the first-line diagnostic and manage￾ment tool for bleeding gastric varices, as it is in all upper gastrointestinal bleeding
scenarios. In the United States when endoscopy fails to control gastric variceal bleeding,
a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) traditionally is performed along
the classic teachings of decompressing the portal circulation. However, TIPS has not
shown the same effectiveness in controlling gastric variceal bleeding that it has with
esophageal variceal bleeding. For the past 2 decades, the balloon-occluded retrograde
transvenous obliteration (BRTO) procedure has become common practice in Asia for the
management of gastric varices. BRTO is gaining popularity in the United States. It has
been shown to be effective in controlling gastric variceal bleeding with low rebleed
rates. BRTO has many advantages over TIPS in that it is less invasive and can be
performed on patients with poor hepatic reserve and those with encephalopathy (and
may even improve both). However, its by-product is occlusion of a spontaneous
hepatofugal (TIPS equivalent) shunt, and thus it is contradictory to the traditional
American doctrine of portal decompression. Indeed, BRTO causes an increase in portal
hypertension, with potential aggravation of esophageal varices and ascites. This article
discusses the concept, technique, and outcomes of BRTO within the broader manage￾ment of gastric varices.

BRTO has shown considerable effectiveness in controlling

cause an increase in portal hypertension with concomitant
worsening of esophageal varices and ascites.
This article is an adjunct to a prior Seminars of Interven￾tional Radiology issue (volume 28, 2011) and discusses the
concept, technique, and outcomes of BRTO for the manage￾ment of gastric varices.
Concept of the BRTO Procedure
The concept of BRTO is accessing the portosystemic gastro￾renal shunt via the left renal vein from a transjugular or
transfemoral approach.6–8,37 Most authors refer to Kanagawa
et al (1991–1993) as the inventor of BRTO.6 However, the first
published document of an attempt at balloon-occluded
sclerotherapy of the gastrorenal shunt for the management
of gastric varices was authored by Olson et al in 1984.37 Olson
et al used a transfemoral balloon occlusion catheter and
absolute alcohol for the successful sclerosis attempt.37 Em￾bolic coils were also placed in the outflow gastrorenal
shunt.37 The term used for the procedure was transrenal￾vein reflux ethanol sclerosis and not BRTO.37
Subsequently, Kanagawa and coworkers revived the “BRTO
concept” and developed the BRTO procedure in the early
1990s, coining the currently used term.6 They utilized 5%
ethanolamine oleate (EO) (Oldamin; Grelan Pharmaceutical,
Tokyo, Japan) as an endovascular sclerosant, with which
European and American interventional radiologists were
not familiar.5,6 EO is an established upper endoscopy variceal
sclerosant. However, when used during endovascular proce￾dures, there is a risk for hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and
potentially hemoglobin-induced renal tubular dysfunc￾tion.7,8 Haptoglobin can be administered in response to
free hemoglobin, although it is available in Japan but not
commercially available in the United States for human use.
The Japanese then developed, evolved, and clinically applied
this procedure.6–29 They took it to the clinical level and
established it as the viable and successful procedure it is
today.6–29
Subsequently, in 2006–2007, American interventionalists
introduced a different sclerosant: 3% sodium tetradecyl sul￾fate (3% STS) (Sotradecol, AngioDynamics, Inc. Queensbury,
NY) to perform the BRTO procedure.5 It was developed out of
necessity due to the lack of an antidote for hemolysis (hapto￾globin) in the United States, as well as the unfamiliarity with
EO as an endovascular sclerosant. The first two institutions to
use 3% STS were Mount Sinai (New York) and the Dotter
Institute (Oregon),5 subsequently and independently fol￾lowed by the University of Virginia.5
Preprocedure Clinical and Endoscopic
Evaluation and Management
Initial management of gastric variceal bleeding involves
diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Patients who are
planning to undergo a BRTO procedure for bleeding gastric
varices require preprocedural assessments that include en￾doscopy and clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluation.
Patients undergoing BRTO are cirrhotics that require a mul￾tidisciplinary team approach, as described earlier.2
Clinical Assessment
Patients who are potential candidates for BRTO are either
stable or unstable. BRTO has been reported to be effective in
controlling active bleeding from gastric varices.10,14 Obvious￾ly, stabilizing patients is a priority before full clinical and
diagnostic assessment, although realistically both clinical
assessment and stabilization occur simultaneously. Almost
all patients with gastric varices with established gastrorenal
shunts (traditional BRTO candidates) have cirrhosis that may
be suspected by prior evaluation or through historical, physi￾cal examination, and laboratory findings.1,2 In patients with
known or suspected portal hypertension, medical therapy is
required, including antiportal hypertension medications and
antibiotic prophylaxis.2
Fluid Resuscitation
Not all patients undergoing BRTO for gastric varices are
unstable; in fact, most are stabilized before the actual BRTO
procedure. Basic life-sustaining and resuscitative measures
routine to any form of gastrointestinal bleeding are initiated.
However, physicians must be cognizant of avoiding overag￾gressive fluid resuscitation that can exacerbate portal hyper￾tension because multiple reports have established that
volume expansion increases portal vein pressure.2,38–40 Var￾iceal bleeding is predominantly portal pressure driven; thus it
is apparent that minimizing portal pressure is an important
goal in managing these patients. To avoid significant volume
expansion and subsequent elevated portal venous pressures,
systemic blood pressures lower than normal are therefore
acceptable. Also to this end, a lower target hematocrit (21%)
with packed red blood cell transfusions, along with optimi￾zation of platelet count and function, are commonly targeted
goals.41,42 Renal function support may also be necessary for
volume control and platelet function.
Endoscopic Management of Bleeding Gastric Varices
Once the patient is stabilized, upper gastrointestinal endos￾copy is usually undertaken as a routine early measure to
evaluate upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper gastrointes￾tinal endoscopy is essential for diagnosing, triaging the

management of, and/or treating upper gastrointestinal bleed￾ing.1,2 The identification of which varices, if any, are bleeding
is essential. Esophageal varices can be controlled effectively
by endoscopic-guided banding and sclerotherapy. Bleeding
esophageal varices that cannot be controlled medically and
endoscopically would warrant a TIPS procedure and not a
BRTO.43,44 Bleeding from gastric varices that are small and
exhibit slow flow by endoscopic Doppler ultrasound (EUS)
can be sclerosed (or “glued”) endoscopically and may not
necessarily require a BRTO procedure. However, if there are
large fundic and/or cardiac gastric varices exhibiting high
flow, some endoscopists would defer to a BRTO procedure
due to concerns about causing intravascular (usually systemic
venous) nontarget embolization of the sclerosant. Obviously,
if bleeding is from a combined gastric and esophageal varices,
then the esophageal varices can be managed by endoscopy
and large high-flow gastric varices could be managed by
BRTO. In the presence of large high-flow gastric varices and
prominent but not bleeding esophageal varices, preemptive
esophageal variceal banding may be warranted because BRTO
exacerbates portal hypertension and may aggravate esoph￾ageal varices.10,13,35
Preprocedure Imaging Evaluation
Quality imaging is critical to evaluate for patient candidacy for
the BRTO procedure and important for the planning of the
procedure.2 The main anatomical and hemodynamic features
(►Fig. 1) to be considered before performing the BRTO
procedure include portal vein patency, presence and size of
gastrorenal shunts (for conventional BRTO), presence and
sizes of alternative portosystemic shunts, and leading sys￾temic veins (for unconventional BRTO) that can be located
above or below the diaphragm (►Fig. 2). These peri-/trans￾diaphragmatic veins include the left phrenic, left pericardiac
vein, ileocolic veins, and the azygo-esophago venous/variceal
axis (►Fig. 3A–3C).45–57
Main Portal Vein Patency
Gastrorenal shunts and splenorenal shunts, if present, are
portosystemic collaterals that naturally occur and promote
hepatofugal flow.5 To what extent the “catchment veins” are
affected by gastro-spleno-renal shunts is unknown but likely
depends on the size of the gastrorenal shunt, the presence of a
TIPS, the patency of the main portal vein, and other hemody￾namic variables such as the resistance of the sinusoidal bed.
However, in the presence of a completely thrombosed main
portal vein, gastrorenal shunts act as the primary outflow of
the splenic and mesenteric veins.2 In the presence of a
thrombosed main portal vein, occlusion of the gastrorenal
shunt, which is a by-product of the BRTO procedure, would
potentially cause mesenteric venous hypertension, mesen￾teric ischemia, and possibly thrombosis of the entire splanch￾nic portal venous circulation. Although portal vein
thrombosis is not an absolute contraindication to BRTO, it
is a hemodynamic dilemma that has not been investigated
fully. Chronic occlusion of the main portal vein with cavern￾ous transformation may provide sufficient outflow for the
portal venous system after occluding the portosystemic
shunts, and therefore it may be acceptable to proceed with
the BRTO procedure with the risks and benefits of the
procedure taken into consideration.2
Partial thromboses of the main portal vein, or the presence
of a diminutive but patent main portal vein, may actually
improve after occluding the competing hepatofugal porto￾systemic shunts because the result is improved flow through
the main portal vein.6–8,58 Conversely, a very diminutive
portal vein may be a sign of a long-standing very large
gastrorenal shunt, which if occluded in the process of a
BRTO procedure may be overwhelmed by the increased
flow. If the portal vein does not dilate and the liver cannot
accept this excess hepatopetal flow, there will be no outflow
to the portal vein, which will in turn lead to portal venous
flow stagnation and possible portal vein thrombosis.
Figure 1 The large and more common gastric varices and shunts. The
two main infra-diaphragmatic portosystemic shunts: the gastrocaval
and gastrorenal shunts. The common afferent (portovenous feeders)
to the gastric varices are left gastric vein (LGV) (also known as the
coronary vein), the posterior gastric vein(s) (PGV), and the short
gastric veins (SGV). The SGV and PGV arise from the splenic vein (SV),
and the LGV arises from the confluence of the splenic vein and the
mesenteric vein(s) (SMV). The LGV may also arise from the proximal
main portal vein (PV). The efferent limbs of the gastric varices, which
drain the gastric varices into the systemic circulation, either drain
directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC) (the gastrocaval shunt) or into
the left renal vein (LRV) (gastrorenal shunt). The asterisk denotes a
direct communication between the splenic vein and the shunt/left
renal vein, demonstrating a spleno-renal shunt or a spleno-renal
component of the gastrorenal shunt. (Used with permission

Presence of a Gastrorenal or Gastrocaval Shunt
For the conventional BRTO procedure, a large infradiaphrag￾matic “left-sided” portosystemic collateral is required.3–5 The
most common shunt to be occluded during a conventional
BRTO procedure is a gastrorenal shunt, which provides
venous outflow in 90% of gastric varices cases. The remaining
10% of gastric varices drain through a gastrocaval shunt
(infra-diaphragmatically), or other less common transdiaph￾ragmatic veins.45–57 Preprocedural imaging is important in
assessing the sites, types, and morphology of these portosys￾temic shunts.2
The diameter of these shunts (particularly the gastrorenal
shunt) needs to be measured to plan for the BRTO procedure.
The diameter of the gastrorenal shunt is typically measured at
the base of the shunt, at the communication point with the
left renal vein. This is typically the site at which intervention￾alists attempt to occlude the shunt with the balloon-occlusion
catheter for the BRTO procedure.2 However, it may not
necessarily be the narrowest site, and experienced interven￾tionalists will evaluate the entire shunt to determine the
narrowest points at which they can occlude the shunt safely.
One common cause of technical failure of the BRTO procedure
is the presence of shunts that are too large for the available
balloon-occlusion catheter inventory.4 Thus knowing shunt
sizes, areas of narrowing, and knowing the available balloon￾occlusion catheter inventory is essential for the planning of
the BRTO procedure.
Cross-Sectional Imaging Modalities Used
Three-phase contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CE￾CT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography/
magnetic resonance venography (MRV) provides optimal
visualization of the main portal vein and its tributaries.2 It
is important not to use oral contrast agents because these
may obscure visualization of the varices. Perhaps the best CT
or MR reformat plane to evaluate gastro-variceal systems for
pre-BRTO candidacy evaluation and procedure planning is
coronal reformats.2 Contrast-enhanced MRI is similar to
three-phase CE-CT and provides optimal visualization of
the portal veins and its branches as well as the gastrorenal
and gastrocaval shunts, the gastric varices, and the afferent
gastric veins.2 Dynamic postcontrast sequences provide the
most information to plan the BRTO procedure as described
later. T2-weighted sequences can also provide adequate
visualization of the components of the gastric varices, as
well as the inflow and outflow veins.2
Portal vein patency with or without cavernous transforma￾tion can be easily demonstrated by cross-sectional imaging.
Large portosystemic shunts such as gastrorenal shunts can
easily be identified, characterized, and sized. Smaller venous
collaterals and portosystemic shunts can be more difficult to
assess fully and require dedicated imaging techniques. The
afferent gastric veins (portal venous branches leading to the
gastric varices) contributing to the gastric varices can also be
identified and assessed on CE-CTor MRV. This is especially true
for simple gastric-variceal systems, such as type 1 gastric
varices. Type I varices occur when there is afferent flow
from one dominant afferent (portal branch) vein into the
posterior or left gastric veins, leading to the gastric varices.2
However, it may be difficult to fully identify and assess all
contributor veins in complex gastric-variceal systems with
numerous, and usually smaller, portosystemic veins.
One of the rarely mentioned advantages of three-phase
CE-CT or MRV is that it evaluates the whole abdomen.
Secondary findings of cirrhosis (including liver morphology
and ascites) would support that the patient is cirrhotic.
Furthermore, ascites is a key finding that should be noted

in BRTO candidates. The presence of ascites is usually as sign of
relative decompensation and would be expected to increase
after BRTO. For elective BRTO, this should be evaluated in the
risks-versus-benefit discussion of the procedure, and possibly
future TIPS placement may be contemplated and discussed
with the patient prior to performing the BRTO procedure.
BRTO Procedure
The BRTO procedure is an endovascular technique that causes
occlusion of outflow portosystemic shunt, such as a gastro￾renal shunt, using an occlusion balloon followed by the
endovascular injection of a sclerosing agent directly into
the gastro-variceal system/complex.6–8,20,58 The gastro-var￾iceal system/complex is a collective term for the gastro-renal
shunt and the gastric or gastroesophageal varices. Balloon
occlusion is used to for two technical reasons: (1) occlusion of
the gastrorenal shunt so that retrograde (upstream) venog￾raphy can be performed to visualize the gastric-variceal
system/complex and (2) to modulate flow and cause stagna￾tion of the sclerosant within the gastric-variceal system
without reflux of the sclerosant into either the portal or
systemic vasculature.3,5 Stagnation in the flow is helpful to
maximize sclerosant dwell time to achieve maximal effect of
the sclerosant on the gastro-variceal system endothelial
lining, leading to thrombosis and subsequent scarring of
the system. As can be deduced, stagnation of flow (both for
diagnosis and therapy) is essential to the BRTO procedure.4
Unconventional routes have also been described;45 how￾ever, the scope of this article does not allow a detailed
discussion of these routes. These alternative routes
include but are not confined to transcaval, trans-phrenic,
trans-pericardiac, trans-iliocolic, trans-TIPS, trans-gonadal,
trans-azygous, and trans-renal capsular vein approaches
(►Figs. 3 and 4).45–57 Percutaneous transhepatic obliteration
(PTO), practiced in the 1970s and predating the TIPS era, is
actually the first described route used solely for the oblitera￾tion (embolization) of gastric and esophageal varices.59–63
With the advent of BRTO in the early 1990s, it has been used
as a second choice approach or an adjunct to the traditional
transrenal BRTO approach.7,8,64 PTO has also been termed by
Saad and Sze as balloon-occluded anterograde (antegrade)
transvenous obliteration (BATO).65
BRTO or BATO procedures for gastric varices are purely
endovenous procedures using standard angiographic techni￾ques with basic steps that include percutaneous venous access,
endovascular approach and catheterization, retrograde balloon￾aided venography, balloon-aided sclerosis, intraprocedural im￾aging confirmation, and balloon dwell time and removal.4,6,7
Vascular Access
Percutaneous venous access of the femoral or internal jugular
vein using standard Seldinger technique is performed with
placement of a 6 to 14F sheath. Most operators use a right
femoral vein approach; however, certain operators have
adopted the jugular vein approach exclusively.7,66 The jugular
approach typically requires a longer sheath system, especially
in tall patients. Careful review of preprocedure cross-section￾al imaging helps decide the approach that provides the best
angle for selecting the target gastrorenal shunt.
Shunt Catheterization
In Asia, catheterization of the gastrorenal shunt via the left
renal vein is typically accomplished using catheters with
mounted occlusion balloons that are specifically designed
for the BRTO procedure.66 Reversed-shaped balloon catheters
Figure 3 Compare with ►Figure 2. (A) The balloon-occlusion catheter being advanced from a transfemoral approach and positioned and

(Cobra shaped and Simmons shaped) that provide effortless
and stable access into the gastrorenal shunt are available in
Asia.6–30 Unfortunately, these specifically designed catheters
are not available in the United States.66 For this reason,
operators in the United States use reverse curve diagnostic
angiographic catheters (usually Cobra shaped or Simmons
shaped; Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY) to select the gas￾trorenal shunt from the inferior vena cava. Subsequently, an
over-the-wire exchange is made to advance the balloon￾occlusion catheter into the gastrorenal shunt.
Shunt Occlusion
The balloon-occlusion catheter, with the compliant balloon
mounted on the catheter, is sized to occlude the draining
gastrorenal shunt. Numerous generic balloon-occlusion cath￾eters are available in the United States. These include but are
not limited to Python occlusion balloon (Applied Medical,
Rancho Santa Margarita, CA), Equalizer (Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA), Standard Occlusion Balloon Catheters (Boston
Scientific), Flow Directed Occlusion Balloon Catheters (Cook
Inc., Bloomington, IN), and the Coda (Cook). The gastrorenal
shunt can be occluded at any point where there is a narrowing
within the gastrorenal shunt; occlusion does not have to
occur at the confluence of the shunt and the left renal vein.
Retrograde Venography with or without Cone-Beam
Tomography
Balloon-occlusion venography is performed to define the type
of gastric variceal system and determine the anatomy of
venous drainage. The cases are classified according to the
venous drainage pattern into types A, B, C, and D.7,8,66 The
scope of this article does not permit description and discus￾sion of gastric variceal types; however, in general, the opera￾tor attempts to opacify the whole gastric-variceal system with
its afferent (portal venous supply) and any efferent (systemic
draining veins) veins that decompress the system. Not un￾commonly, draining systemic efferent veins preclude initial
full opacification of the gastric variceal system and must be
embolized to have a more complete evaluation of the entire
system.4,66 Identification of the afferent vessels (portal ve￾nous supply) is to familiarize the operator with the “the point
of no return” where sclerosant injection is stopped just before
overspill occurs into the portal venous system (splenic and
main portal vein).
Once the entire gastric-variceal system is opacified, a cone￾beam C-arm computed tomogram (Dyna CT, Siemens Medi￾cal, Malvern, PA) can be performed. Although not necessary,
the cone-beam CT can be used to ensure that the entire
system is opacified, especially all the gastric varices proper.66
Such visualization can be particularly helpful for novice
operators. Correlation with preprocedural axial CT and MR
images using gastric, splenic, and hepatic landmarks enables
the operator to identify whether he or she is filling the entire
system.
Sclerosant Injection
The aim during sclerosant injection is to fill the entire gastric￾variceal system so that no varices remain and no dispensable
portosystemic connections are left for the system to revascu￾larize. The embolization end point is minimal filling of the
afferent portal vasculature that was previously identified
during balloon retrograde venography. Injection of a scleros￾ing agent can be performed with or without use of a micro￾catheter.56 I do suggest advancing a microcatheter, if feasible,
through or adjacent to the balloon-occlusion catheter as
deeply as possible into the gastric-variceal system.56 This
allows an even distribution of sclerosant in the system for
optimal sclerosis effect.56
Numerous sclerosing agents can be used and have been
described. These agents include 5 to 10% EO (Oldamin; Grelan
Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan), 3% STS (Sotradecol, AngioDy￾namics), and Polidocanol (Polidocasklerol, ZERIA Pharmaceu￾tical, Tokyo, Japan). All agents can be used in foam, froth, or
liquid form. In addition, liquid sclerosants such as N-butyl￾cyanoacrylate and absolute (97 to 99%) ethanol have also
been used.66,67 EO is the traditional agent used for BRTO and
is still the agent of choice in Asia.6–30 EO causes hemolysis in
the blood vessels; as a result, free hemoglobin is released,
which may cause renal tubular disturbances and acute renal
failure. To prevent renal insufficiency, 2000 to 4000 U of
haptoglobin (Green Cross, Osaka, Japan) is routinely admin￾istered intravenously during the BRTO to chelate the circulat￾ing free hemoglobin to minimize its nephrotoxic effects.7,8

There are considerable limiting factors for using EO in the
United States, including the lack of endovascular experience
with this agent, lack of availability in the desirable concen￾trations, and that the antidote is not approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). As a result, 3% STS is the most
commonly used sclerosant in the United States.5
For sclerotherapy of superficial lower extremity varicosi￾ties and spider veins, 3% STS is used.68,69 It has also been
utilized as a foam sclerosant in treating male varicoceles,
pelvic congestion syndromes, and venous malforma￾tions.70–73 Its availability in the United States, familiarity
with the agent by interventionalists, and the lower risk of
hemolysis (no need for haptoglobin antidote) have made it
the sclerosant of choice in the United States.
Once the entire gastric-variceal system is filled with
sclerosant, I recommend performing a cone-beam C-arm
computed tomogram to ensure that the entire system is
filled with sclerosant, especially all the gastric varices
proper. Correlation with preprocedural axial CT and MR
images using gastric, splenic, and hepatic landmarks en￾ables the operator to identify whether he or she is filling the
entire system.66,67
Sclerosant Dwell Time (Balloon Dwell Time)
The balloon-occlusion catheters are left inflated for 4 to
24 hours. Operators at my institution start with overnight
inflation (12 to 24 hours), which actually inadvertently led to
some sclerosant dwell time of up to 36 hours. Over time, the
dwell time has been reduced safely to 4 to 6 hours.66,67 This
protocol has been adopted for logistical reasons, such as cost
concerns (patients stay overnight in monitored beds), patient
comfort, and reducing the infection risk of indwelling cath￾eters tethered at skin sites.66
Technical and Hemodynamic Results of BRTO
Technical Success of the BRTO Procedure
The technical success of BRTO for patients with gastrorenal
shunts (without adjunctive endoscopic sclerotherapy and/or
BATO rescue) ranges from 79% to 100%.10–19,22,24,27–29,32–35
In 10 studies that intended to treat gastric varices from one
session, a total of 457 BRTO procedures with and without
BATO rescue were evaluated. In these studies, 419 procedures
(91.7%) were technically successful.10–13,16–19,33,35 The range
of technical success in each individual study was 84 to
100%.10–13,16–19,33,35 In two studies that specifically identi￾fied primary treatment of gastric varices with BRTO (reserv￾ing BATO via a percutaneous transhepatic route as a rescue),
the technical success rates were 84 to 98% (BRTO only) and
100% (BATO only or combined BRTO and BATO).11,14
A different technical approach is to sclerose the gastric
varices in multiple sessions, limiting the amount of sclerosant
used. For these multisession administrations, 20 to 30 mL
of EO is used for each session in an attempt to reduce the
dose-related complication of hemolysis with its potential
hemoglobinuria-induced renal dysfunction. In these reports,
patients who did not have obliteration of all gastric varices
from the prior session returned for a subsequent
session.7,14,15,22,29,36 With a total of 210 BRTO procedures
in five studies adopting this approach, the first, second, and
third BRTO sessions were technically successful with com￾plete obliteration of the gastric varices in 56 to 87%, 79 to
100%, and 81 to 100% of patients, respectively.7,14,15,22,29,36
Cumulatively, the first, second, and third session technical
success rate of the 210 BRTO cases in these five studies is 71%
(N ¼ 150 of 210), 88% (N ¼ 185 of 210), and 91% (N ¼ 191 of
210), respectively.7,14,22,29,36
Causes of technical failure are classified by the current
authors as types I to IV. Type I failures occur because of the
inability to cannulate the gastrorenal shunt or sclerosant
extravasation; type II failures occur because of an inability
to occlude the shunt due to an undersized balloon (this is a
type V shunt as defined by Fukuda et al).14 Type III failures are
subcategorized into two types and due to the inability to
opacify the shunt (despite a well-inflated and appropriate
size balloon) due to a complex multicollateral gastrorenal/
gastric variceal system (IIIa) or extravasation of contrast/
sclerosant into the retroperitoneum (IIIb). Type IV failures
are due to early (usually within 1 to 2 hours) occlusive￾balloon rupture requiring a repeat BRTO. Such balloon rup￾tures are known to occur in 2.3 to 8.7% of BRTO cases.27,31
However, not all occur early and lead to technical failure
(50% of balloon ruptures do so).31
Unfortunately, in published reports not all technical fail￾ures are disclosed in detail, and reporting standards often are
not used. Having said that, the most common cause of
technical failure is likely a complex multicollateral gastro￾renal system with the resultant inability to fully opacify,
“trap,” and sclerose the gastric varix (type III
failure).10,12,14–34,36,74–79 In three studies evaluating 160
BRTO procedures with 14 technical failures (91.3% technical
success), type I failures (cannulation/extravasation) repre￾sented 14% of failures (N ¼ 2 of 14) and 1.3% of BRTO cases
(N ¼ 2 of 160); type II failures (small for size balloons)
represented 36% of failures (N ¼ 5 of 14) of failures and
3.1% of BRTO cases (N ¼ 5 of 160); type III failures (unable
to opacify and “trap”) represented 43% of failures (N ¼ 6 of
14) and 3.8% of BRTO cases (N ¼ 6 of 160); and type IV failures
(early balloon rupture) represented 7.1% of failures (N ¼ 1 of
14) and 0.6% of BRTO cases (N ¼ 1 of 160).11,13,25 ►Table 1
lists the procedural and postprocedural (including long-term)
complications.10,12,14–16,18,19,22–24,27,31–34,79
Hemodynamic Outcome of the BRTO Procedure
Many studies report the success rate of BRTO based on the
obliteration rate of the gastric varices by follow-up imaging,
such as CT venography, MRV, and/or EUS. In 14 studies
evaluating post-BRTO gastric variceal obliteration in a total
of 580 BRTO procedures, obliteration rates in the intent-to￾treat (including technically failed BRTO procedures) popula￾tion and in technically successful BRTO procedures were 73 to
100% and 75 to 100%, respectively.10,12,14–17,22,24,27–29,32

rate, the intent-to-treat obliteration rate, and the obliteration
rate of gastric varices of technically successful BRTO

procedures were 91% (N ¼ 529 of 580), 86% (N ¼ 496 of 580),
and 94% (N ¼ 496 of 529), respectively.10,12,14–17,22,24,27–29,32
Clinical Outcomes of BRTO
The primary indications for BRTO are gastric variceal bleeding
(or potential bleeding) and refractory encephalopathy in the
presence of a gastrorenal shunt.10–36,74–79 In two studies
evaluating a total of 20 patients, the effectiveness of BRTO
in controlling actively bleeding gastric varices was 91 to
100%.10,14 The gastric variceal and global variceal rebleed
rate are discussed later.
The aggravation of nongastric (esophageal or duodenal)
varices appears to be a major problem following
BRTO and reflects postprocedural increased portal
hypertension.10,12–14,18,23,24,31,32,34,35 This effect varies
widely, probably depending on the degree of vigilance,
documentation, and thoroughness of follow-up endoscopy.
However, in four major studies evaluating 160 patients who
had undergone BRTO and who underwent continuous endo￾scopic follow-up post-BRTO, the esophageal variceal aggra￾vation rate at 1, 2, and 3 years was 27 to 35%, 45 to 66%, and 45
to 91%, respectively.12,18,22,30 In another two studies evaluat￾ing 117 patients following BRTO, the percentage of patients
with aggravated esophageal varices was 30 to 68%, and 36 to
57% of patients with aggravated esophageal varices went on
to bleeding.13,32 Again, one can speculate that the rate of
esophageal variceal bleeding may be significantly reduced by
a higher vigilance of endoscopic follow-up and more aggres￾sive endoscopic therapy. Other reported complications reflec￾tive of increased portal hypertension following BRTO are the
development of portal hypertensive gastropathy (occurs in 5
to 13%), ascites (occurs in 0 to 44%), and hydrothorax/pleural
effusion (occurs in 0 to 8%).15,18,19,22,27,33
The rebleeding rate following BRTO depends on the defini￾tion used. Most studies display a gastric variceal rebleed rate in
patients who had undergone a successful BRTO procedure that
ranges between 0% and 10%.10–19,24,32,33,35,74 However, when
factoring in an intent-to-treat basis (including technical failures)
for the results, the gastric variceal rebleed rate is 0 to
31.6%.10–19,24,32,33,35,74 Many studies do not clearly state what
source, if any, the global rebleed rate is from: gastric, esophage￾al, or duodenal varices as well as portal hypertensive
gastropathy.10–19,24,32,33,35,74 In three clearly reported studies

evaluating a total of 141 patients who had undergone BRTO, the
gastric variceal rebleed rate of successful BRTO procedures, the
intent-to-treat gastric variceal rebleed rate and the global (all
types of varices) variceal rebleed rates were 3.2 to 8.7%, 10 to
20%, and 19 to 31%, respectively.10,13,35
The greatest advantages of BRTO are its preservation of
hepatic function and its reduction in the risk of hepatic
encephalopathy.3,4 In fact, one of the indications for BRTO
is encephalopathy with the presence of a gastrorenal or
gastro-splenorenal shunt.14,20,21,24,28,33 In five studies eval￾uating a total of 35 patients with encephalopathy, there was
resolution or significant reduction in encephalopathy in all
patients (100% success).14,20,22,24,33 An interesting study by
Kumamoto et al had three branches.19 In one group were
patients with no gastrorenal shunt (the control group), the
second cohort had a gastrorenal shunt that was not treated
(with BRTO or by any other means), and the third group were
patients with gastrorenal shunts that were treated with
BRTO.19 Those with untreated gastrorenal shunts had pro￾gressively deteriorating hepatic function (by the Child-Pugh
score), whereas those that had BRTO had transient improve￾ment in hepatic function for 6 to 12 months and then a return
to baseline hepatic function up to 3 years. The patients
without gastrorenal shunts (control group) had stable hepatic
function similar to those patients with BRTO. This suggested
that BRTO has a protective long-term role in preserving
hepatic function and protecting the liver from “portosystemic
shunt syndrome.”
19
Survival following BRTO is generally favorable. The Ka￾plan-Meier survival rate after BRTO at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years
ranges from 83 to 98%, 76 to 79%, 66 to 85%, and 39 to 69%,
respectively.11,18,24,25,30,33,36 Obviously, the greatest deter￾minate of survival is the patient's hepatic reserve (deter￾mined by Child-Pugh score and/or model for end-stage liver
disease score).13,14,28,29 However, hepatocellular carcinoma
is also a significant determinate of survival22,28,29 to the
extent that prior authors have considered an intrahepatic
hepatocellular carcinoma >5 cm to serve as a contraindica￾tion to BRTO.22
Conclusion
BRTO has shown considerable effectiveness in controlling
gastric variceal bleeding with low rebleed rates. It has
many advantages versus TIPS in that it is less invasive and
can be performed on patients with poor hepatic reserve and
encephalopathy (and may even improve both). However, its
by-product is occlusion of a spontaneous hepatofugal (TIPS
equivalent) shunt and thus is somewhat contradictory to the
traditional American doctrine of the need for portal decom￾pression. Indeed, BRTO causes an increase in portal hyper￾tension with aggravation of esophageal varices and ascites.
Despite these controversies, the BRTO procedure is gaining
popularity in the United States. With the increasing experi￾ence with the management of gastric varices (endoscopy,
TIPS, and BRTO), one is hopeful that management of gastric
varices will be tailored to patient anatomy, clinical features of
portal hypertension, and hepatic reserve.
