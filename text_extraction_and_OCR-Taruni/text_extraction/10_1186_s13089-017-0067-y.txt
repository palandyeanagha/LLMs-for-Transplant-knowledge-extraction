Abstract
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is a minimally invasive monitoring tool that can provide real-time 
visual information on ventricular function and hemodynamic volume status in patients undergoing liver transplanta￾tion. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases states that transesophageal echocardiography should 
be used in all liver transplant candidates in order to assess chamber sizes, hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic function, 
valvular function, and left ventricle outflow tract obstruction. However, intraoperative transesophageal echocardi￾ography can be used to “visualize” other organs too; thanks to its proximity and access to multiple acoustic windows: 
liver, lung, spleen, and kidney. Although only limited scientific evidence exists promoting this comprehensive use, we 
describe the feasibility of TEE in the setting of liver transplantation: it is a highly valuable tool, not only as a cardiovas￾cular monitoring, but also as a tool to evaluate lungs and pleural spaces, to assess hepatic vein blood flow and inferior 
vena cava anastomosis and patency, i.e., in cases of modified surgical techniques. The aim of this case series is to add 
our own experience of TEE as a comprehensive intraoperative monitoring tool in the field of orthotopic liver trans￾plantation (and major liver resection) to the literature.

Introduction
The gold standard methods for monitoring cardiac out￾put during liver transplantation surgery are pulmonary 
arterial catheterization and volumetric device monitor￾ing (PiCCO/EV-1000); nonetheless experts agree that 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is useful for 
managing rapid hemodynamic changes [1]. The Ameri￾can Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 
states that TEE should be used in all liver transplant can￾didates in order to assess chamber sizes, hypertrophy, 
systolic and diastolic function, valvular function, and left 
ventricle outflow tract obstruction [2].
The use of the TEE during liver transplantation to 
monitor cardiac function and to assess the inferior vena 
cava patency was described for the first time in 1992. In 
that case, the TEE probe was used in a patient with a sus￾pected stricture of the suprahepatic inferior vena cava 
(IVC) anastomosis to evaluate its patency and the subse￾quent surgical intervention. The authors described how 
following separation from the venous–venous bypass, 
the liver appeared swollen, while the Doppler color flow 
imaging demonstrated marked turbulence in the supra￾hepatic IVC with narrow jet streaming into the right 
atrium [3]. With manual elevation of the liver, the pres￾sure gradient disappeared, which allowed them to under￾stand that the obstruction was due to the kinking of the 
vessel, and the anastomosis was revised. Color Doppler 
was once again performed and showed a decrease in the 
turbulence of the IVC blood flow. The case demonstrated 
that TEE can be used to assess the suprahepatic anasto￾mosis, providing an early, non-invasive assessment of 
abnormalities that may require prompt correction. After 
this initial article, reports of TEE for the evaluation of

hepatic vein structures have been scarce, despite the fact 
that TEE is becoming an increasingly popular tool in liver 
transplant surgery [4, 5].
Study rationale and aim
Unrecognized IVC stenosis, thrombosis, and kink￾ing during liver transplantation can lead to devastating 
consequences, requiring the patient to undergo fur￾ther operations, such as surgical repair or re-transplant. 
The images in Fig.  1 show percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty and double stent placement in a 63-year-old 
cirrhotic patient presenting suprahepatic IVC outflow 
compromise in the early postoperative period following 
orthotopic liver transplantation. The American Society 
of Echocardiography/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthe￾siologists now recommends that images of the IVC and 
hepatic veins are obtained as part of a comprehensive 
perioperative examination [6]. As reported in a recent 
editorial, although TEE has mainly been used in the con￾text of the heart, it can also be used to “visualize” other

organs. Inserting the probe beyond the bicaval view is 
helpful for assessing the IVC, the liver, and the hepatic 
veins. Furthermore, the literature contains many reports 
of TEE imaging of the pleura, the kidneys, and even the 
spinal cord [7–10].
The aim of this case series is to add our own experience 
of TEE as a comprehensive intraoperative monitoring 
tool in the field of orthotopic liver transplantation (and 
major liver resection) to the literature.
Surgical considerations
The orthotopic liver transplantation technique was first 
described as a complete resection of the recipient’s IVC 
and interposition of the donor intrahepatic vena cava with 
two end-to-end anastomosis; for hemodynamic stabiliza￾tion, the procedure also includes a veno-venous bypass, 
usually from left femoral to left axillary vein. In many 
centers, this approach still remains the gold standard [11]. 
In 1989 Tzakis et al. [12] introduced a new modified tech￾nique called the ‘piggy-back’ technique, which consists 
of preserving the full length of the recipient’s vena cava, 
but with anastomosis of the donor suprahepatic veins 
to the ostium of the recipient’s left and middle suprahe￾patic veins. The supporters of the piggy-back technique 
advocate the advantages of this procedure as the shorter 
operation times with a shorter anhepatic phase and warm 
ischemia, with one less anastomosis. This could reduce 
blood loss and give better hemodynamic stability without 
the use of a venous–venous bypass.
The ‘dark side’ of the piggy-back technique is the 
potential for venous outflow obstruction caused by size 
discrepancy between the donor suprahepatic vena cava 
and the recipient’s hepatic veins’ cuff: the associated risk 
of intra- or postoperative outflow problems of the graft 
has been reported to be between 1.5 and 8%, leading to 
major functional problems of the liver graft [13, 14]. For 
example, Cescon et al. experienced outflow problems in 
4.6% of their patients, leading to a re-transplantation rate 
of 40%; outflow problems were also the cause of death in 
23% of cases [15].
Case 1
The images presented in Fig. 2 were acquired during liver 
transplant surgery in a 59-year-old patient with decom￾pensated liver cirrhosis, severe portal hypertension, 
oesophageal varices (grade F2), and ascites secondary to 
previous alcohol abuse. After hepatectomy, performed 
using the piggy-back technique, [4] the donor suprahepatic 
IVC was anastomized to the hepatic vein cuff of the recipi￾ent, but the infrahepatic vena cava of the graft was over￾sewn. Following portal vein reperfusion, the graft started 
to swell and indurate in just a few minutes due to insuf￾ficient outflow. It is known that this condition, without 
correction, can lead to acute Budd–Chiari-like syndrome 
with graft loss in the immediate postoperative period [14]. 
The surgeons decided to perform a rescue terminolateral 
cavo-cavostomy by anastomosis of the donor infrahepatic 
vena cava to the recipient’s suprarenal vena cava to correct 
the inadequate outflow [16], as shown in Fig. 3.
A TEE examination of the liver was performed at 
the edge of the transesophageal transgastric view at 0 
degrees; the probe was rotated clockwise and the pha￾sic array signal emitted transducer moved between 40° 
and 60°, as previously described, to generate the basic 
hepatic view [17]. The donor and the recipient IVC were 
viewed in parallel, together with the flow through the 
cavocaval anastomosis, as reported in Additional file  1: 
Video 1, Additional file 2: Video 2, and Fig. 4. At the same 
time, the liver progressively assumed completely normal 
dimensions, color, and tissue consistency.

before the cavo-cavostomy rescue anastomosis, a

profound reduction in the preload due to the sequestra￾tion of blood in the liver and in the splanchnic circulation 
occurred, and adrenaline boluses were administered to 
support the hemodynamics. Because of this, the patient 
developed a transient ballooning syndrome that fortu￾nately recovered after the increase in systolic pressure 
upon the second declamping following the cavo-cavos￾tomy anastomosis (Additional file 3: Video 3).

67-year-old woman with a giant hepatic angioma. During 
the surgical dissection of the tissues, an accidental lacera￾tion of the inferior vena cava occurred, which required 
almost complete clamping. To re-establish blood flow, 
the surgeons used an Edwards® Bovine Pericardial 
Patch. After declamping, the surgeon requested that the 
patency of the inferior vena cava and blood flow in the 
suprahepatic veins were checked using TEE. A compari￾son of TEE for visualization of the main hepatic veins 
with the acquisition of Doppler ultrasound curves using 
the transabdominal approach was first described by Mei￾erhenrich et al. [18] in their study of 34 patients sched￾uled for abdominal surgery. Using a multiplane TEE, they 
were able to identify the three main hepatic veins in all 
of the patients, and they reported that adequate Doppler 
tracings of the right and middle hepatic veins could be 
obtained in 100 and 97% of the patients, respectively, by 
TEE and in 91 and 50% of the patients by transabdomi￾nal sonography (TAS). Doppler tracing of the left hepatic 
vein could only be acquired in 18% of the patients by 
TEE, but in 47% of the patients by TAS. Doppler ultra￾sound and Pulse Wave Doppler (PW) analysis, which 
measure blood flow velocity (using a correct insonation 
angle, <60°), play an important role in the assessment 
of liver vessel patency, resistivity, and flow direction (as 
already shown in Figs. 5, 6, and Additional file 4: Video 4 
and Additional file 5: Video 5).
Usually, the normal hepatic vein waveform has four 
components: a retrograde A wave (right atrial contrac￾tion), an anterograde S wave (right ventricular systolic), 
a transitional V wave (pulmonary vein closure), and an 
anterograde D wave (right ventricular diastole)—see 
Fig. 7. The Doppler waveform of left hepatic vein blood 
flow resembles that of the pulmonary vein. It is important 
for the anesthesiologist to know that flow above the base￾line indicates flow toward the transducer and flow below 
the baseline indicates flow away from the transducer. At 
least four questions need to be answered: Is there flow? 
Where it is directed (forward vs. backward)? What is the 
relationship of magnitude between the S and D waves 
(normal S>D vs. abnormal S<D)? What is the magnitude 
of the A wave (normal vs. abnormal)? A detailed explana￾tion has been provided elsewhere [19].
Case 3
During OLTX, the most dangerous phase regarding 
hemodynamic instability is the reperfusion phase, in 
which the surgical clamp is removed leading to a sudden 
release of cold, acidotic, oxidizing, and hyperkalaemic 
fluid into the circulation [20]. This may also be followed 
by reperfusion syndrome, occurring in about 42% of 
patients, which manifests as a temporary myocardial 
dysfunction with a reduction in heart rate, increased 
pulmonary arterial pressure, reduced cardiac venous 
return (preload), and a decrease in mean systemic blood 
pressure (afterload) of 30% [21]. In such cases, the re￾stabilization of the heart becomes priority. In the case of 
reperfusion syndrome, the patient may experience low 
preload and afterload. If the patient has left ventricular 
hypertrophy and long anterior mitral leaflet, left ventric￾ular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) may occur: the 
anterior leaflet of the mitral valve can occlude left ven￾tricle outflow with severe posterolateral mitral regurgi￾tation flow. Without prompt recognition and treatment, 
the patient could develop a profound cardiovascular 
collapse. It is important for the anaesthesiologist to be 
familiar with this possibility and its treatment, which 
principally consists of giving fluid to the patient, increas￾ing afterload with vasoactive drugs, and reducing cardiac 
frequency. The images presented in Fig. 7 and the related 
Additional file 6: Video 6 were acquired in a 57-year-old 
HCV cirrhotic patient during the reperfusion phase of 
the liver transplant.
Case 4
After induction of anesthesia in a 69-year-old patient 
undergoing liver transplantation, the patient suddenly 
developed desaturation, going from 100 to 90% of periph￾eral oxygen saturation in 50% oxygen ventilation. The 
patient did not have any history of hepato-pulmonary 
syndrome, and the preoperative chest X-ray was normal. 
Instead of performing recruitment maneuvers blindly, in 
the hope that the cause of hypoxia was due to the pres￾sure of the diaphragm toward the lungs secondary to 
the abundant ascites, the TEE probe was inserted and 
Fig. 7 Normal triphasic hepatic Doppler waveform. The four 
waveforms constituting the normal spectral Doppler waveform are 
indicated: the A wave lies below the baseline (retrograde compo￾nent); the S and D waves peak above the baseline and are caused 
by anterograde blood flow toward the right heart; and the V wave, a 
transitional wave, may peak just below or above the baseline

Vetrugno et al. Crit Ultrasound J (2017) 9:15 Page 6 of 8
the lungs explored, leading to a rapid diagnosis of right 
pleural effusion due to the passage of the ascites into the 
pleural space.
The reported sensitivity of TEE for the detection of a 
pleural effusion is 97 with 100% specificity (compared 
with gold standard computed tomography) [22]. The 
patient underwent intraoperative pleural drainage and 
saturation was restored (see Fig.  8; Additional file  7: 
Video 7). As recently described by Cavayas et  al. [23] 
transesophageal lung ultrasound (TELU) should be per￾formed as a systematic approach. In TELU, the cranio￾caudal axis of each lung is divided into apical, middle, 
and basal regions; the left subclavian artery is used as a 
landmark to identify the apical regions; the superior pul￾monary veins are used to mark the middle regions; and, 
finally, the inferior vena cava and the right atrial junc￾tion are used to identify the basal segments. From each of 
these landmarks, the lungs are scanned along the longi￾tudinal axis by rotation of the ultrasound plane at 0° and 
90°. In this case, the TEE probe was used because it was 
available as the point-of-care ultrasound methodology.
Discussion
The goal of this paper was to describe how TEE in the 
setting of OLTX is a highly valuable (but maybe underu￾tilized) tool, as it is important not only for cardiovascu￾lar monitoring, but also for evaluating hepatic vein blood 
flow and inferior vena cava anastomosis and patency. We 
describe, for the first time, the use of intraoperative TEE 
for evaluating the patency of a rescue cavo-cavostomy 
anastomosis in the intraoperative phase. TAS, on the 
other hand, is impossible to perform during surgery [16–
18]. In fact, one of the major advantages of using a TEE 
probe is its anatomical proximity to the liver, allowing 
the liver to be studied from the inside without interfer￾ing with the surgery. Furthermore, TEE is more sensitive 
in detecting low blood flow velocity or small changes of 
blood flow in the hepatic veins [18]. Moreover, the litera￾ture reports a case in which intraoperative TEE evalua￾tion of a vena cava tumor resection using the piggy-back 
technique led to a change in the surgical plain [24]. Thus, 
our report is not the first to demonstrate the feasibility 
of obtaining good liver anatomy visualization and accept￾able quality images of the IVC through the use of TEE 
[25].
In patients undergoing liver transplantation, the occur￾rence of reperfusion syndrome can be dangerous, and 
visual assessment of the heart is of extreme importance. 
In the literature, very few reports describe dynamic left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction, probably because 
TEE is used in just 50% of cases and because this con￾dition is difficult to diagnose [26]. No reports describing 
the use of TEE in association with reperfusion syndrome 
or ballooning heart are present in the literature and the 
only case describing its use in liver transplantation is the 
one reported by Lee HR et al. [27] where it was used in 
the postoperative period. So our case is probably the first 
one.
Some limitations should be noted about the present 
study. First, the liver window is not always easy to obtain 
or adequate. Second, the presence of esophagus varices 
or gastric ulcers can limit the extensive use of TEE and its 
use must, of course, be balanced against the risks associ￾ated with performing the procedure [28]. As previously 
reported, patients with esophageal stricture, esophageal 
cancer, esophageal diverticulum, and recent esophageal 
surgery are generally considered to be near absolute con￾traindications for TEE [29]. Moreover, esophageal varices 
have been considered a relative contraindication to TEE, 
depending on the center and/or operator. Third, the 
anaesthesiologist should be skilled. However, TEE is safe 
and feasible in liver transplantation candidates. In fact,

in a recent study, the major complication rate was just 
0.86%, and the overall complication rate was 1.7%—both 
very low, but just slightly higher than that reported in 
cardiac literature in terms of morbidity rate of 0.2% [30].
Conclusions
Echocardiography has become an invaluable tool in 
anesthesia practice and, thanks to its access to multiple 
acoustic windows, many organs (heart, liver, lung, spleen, 
kidney) can be explored in many perioperative diagnos￾tic situations. During liver transplantation or major liver 
surgery, the use of TEE should not just be focused on the 
heart. It is our opinion that blood flow and patency of the 
hepatic anastomosis should be studied by TEE with the 
help of the radiologist before closing the abdomen. If this 
technique were to become adopted as standard proce￾dure, then it would mirror what happened in cardiovas￾cular surgery before cardiac anaesthesiologists became 
confident in using this tool.
