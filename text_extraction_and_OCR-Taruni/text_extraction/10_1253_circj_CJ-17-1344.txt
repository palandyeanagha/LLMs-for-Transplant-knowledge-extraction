Methods
Patients and Protocol
A total of 154 patients with ADHF who were admitted to 
Nihon University Itabashi Hospital between October 2016 
and June 2017 were prospectively enrolled in the study. 
The Framingham criteria were used to diagnose ADHF.8
Patients with excessive alcohol intake (>20g/day) (n=7), 
acute coronary syndrome (n=5), viral hepatitis (n=2), 
hepatic tumors (n=2), body mass index >30kg/m2 (n=11), 
an invalid LS evaluation (n=10), or lost to follow-up 
(n=12) were excluded, leaving 105 subjects in the study. LS 
was measured within 2 days of admission and patients 
were separated into 2 groups based on the median value 
(8.8kPa). According to the Clinical Scenarios (CS) classi￾fication, systolic blood pressure (SBP) at admission 
>140mmHg is defined as vascular failure pattern onset 
(CS1).9 SBP at admission 100–140mmHg is defined as 
cardiorenal failure pattern (CS2) and SBP at admission 
<100mmHg is defined as cardiac failure pattern (CS3).9
Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is often 
accompanied by hepatic congestion through the 
increased right atrial pressure (RAP).1 Hepatic 
dysfunction caused by hepatic congestion is referred to 
as congestive hepatopathy and is related to an adverse 
outcome.2,3 Transient elastography (TE) is a reliable, 
noninvasive technology that can reproducibly assess liver 
stiffness (LS) by measuring the liver shear wave velocity. 
LS is a useful for evaluation of the severity of liver fibrosis 
in chronic viral hepatitis and other chronic liver condi￾tions.4,5 It has recently been reported that liver congestion 
also leads to increased LS because anatomically the liver is 
wrapped by a non-elastic capsule.6 Therefore, LS assessed 
by TE could be a marker of increased RAP and liver 
congestion in patients with general heart failure (HF).7
However, the effect of LS on the clinical variables and 
prognosis of patients with ADHF remains unclear. There￾fore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association 
of LS with clinical and echocardiographic variables and 
prognosis in patients with ADHF.

Background: Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is often accompanied by liver congestion through increased right atrial 
pressure (RAP). Liver stiffness (LS) assessed non-invasively using transient elastography is related to increased RAP and liver 
congestion in patients with general HF. We investigated the relationship of LS with clinical and echocardiographic variables and 
outcomes in patients with ADHF.
Methods and Results: The subjects were 105 patients with ADHF admitted to hospital between October 2016 and June 2017. 
Patients were divided into 2 groups based on median LS at admission (low LS <8.8 kPa [n=52] vs. high LS ≥8.8kPa [n=53]). Death 
from cardiovascular disease and readmission for HF were primary endpoints. Total bilirubin and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, 
MELD-XI score, diameters of the inferior vena cava and right ventricle, and severity of tricuspid regurgitation were greater in the high 
LS group (all P<0.05). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 153 (83–231) days, cardiac events occurred in 29 
patients (54%) in the high LS group and in 13 (25%) in the low LS group (P=0.001). After adjusting for variables that influence organ 
congestion, a high LS ≥8.8kPa was still significantly associated with cardiac events (all P<0.05).
Conclusions: Increased LS measured by transient elastography reflects RAP elevation, hepatic congestion, and hepatic dysfunction. 
LS upon admission may be a useful prognostic marker in patients with ADHF.

Simpson method. The LV end-diastolic diameter (LVDd), 
LV end-systolic diameter (LVDs) and left atrial diameter 
(LAd) were obtained from the parasternal long-axis view. 
The peak early diastolic (E) and late diastolic (A) velocities 
were measured from transmitral flow velocity curves. The 
early diastolic (e’) and late diastolic (a’) myocardial veloc￾ities were obtained from tissue Doppler imaging of the 
mitral annulus at the septal position. The right ventricular 
end-diastolic diameter (RVDd) and tricuspid annular plane 
systolic excursion (TAPSE) were measured from a RV￾focused apical 4-chamber view. Mitral regurgitation and 
tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were graded on a 4-point scale 
based on color-flow Doppler images. Measurement of the 
TR jet area was done on color Doppler images of TR flow. 
From the subcostal view, the diameter of the inferior vena 
cava (IVC) in its long axis was measured within 3 cm of the 
IVC–RA junction during passive respiration. Estimated 
RAP was calculated from the diameter of the IVC and 
respiratory changes, based on the guidelines.12
Evaluation of Liver Function
Routine blood tests were performed on admission. The 
composite Model for End-Stage Liver Disease excluding 
INR (MELD-XI) score was calculated for evaluation of 
liver function: a high score relates to an adverse clinical 
outcome in patients with HF.13 The MELD-XI score was 
calculated as follows: [5.116 log (total bilirubin)+11.766 
log (creatinine)+9.44], with scores <1 given a value of 1.13
The study protocol and use of patient information was 
approved by the Nihon University Itabashi Hospital’s Ethics 
Committee, and informed consent was given by all patients. 
Demographic information was obtained from the medical 
records.
Measurement of LS Using TE
LS measurement was performed by TE (FibroScan; 
Echosens, Paris, France), as described previously.10 A 
representative example of this measurement is shown in 
Figure 1. An experienced cardiologist blinded to the clinical 
data performed the procedure. With the patient in a fasted 
state and lying supine with the right arm at maximal 
abduction, the operator placed the probe perpendicularly 
over the right intercostal space. For each patient, 10 valid 
measurements of LS (in kilopascals (kPa)) were obtained 
and the median value was determined. The evaluation was 
considered reliable if the success rate was at least 60% and 
the interquartile range to median ratio was <30%.
Echocardiography
Experienced sonographers who were blinded to all other 
data performed echocardiography on the same day of LS 
measurement. A Vivid 7 cardiovascular ultrasound system 
(GE Vingmed Ultrasound A.S., Horten, Norway) was used 
with the patient in a supine position. Echocardiographic 
parameters were obtained using American Society of 
Echocardiography guidelines.11,12 Briefly, the left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by the modified

gorical variables are expressed as a number and percentage 
of patients and compared by chi-squared test. To satisfy 
the model assumptions, natural log transformation (ln) 
was used. Event-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan￾Meier method, with group differences compared by log￾rank test. Univariate analysis based on a Cox proportional 
hazards model was used to evaluate the effects of ln LS 
(continuous variable) and high LS (above the median 
value, categorical variable) on cardiac events (death from 
Follow-up
All patients were followed from admission. Follow-up data 
were collected from medical records in a blinded manner. 
The primary endpoints were death from cardiovascular 
disease and readmission for HF.

(3–15) vs. 3 (3–8) mmHg], higher prevalence of severe TR 
(52% vs. 14%), and a lower level of TAPSE [15 (13–17) vs. 
17 (15–19) mm] (Figure 2). Although LVDd, LVEF and 
E/e’ did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, the 
high LS group had larger LAd [47 (42–52) vs. 43 (40–48) 
mm], higher E/A ratio [2.1 (1.0–2.8) vs. 0.8 (0.7–1.6)], and 
lower deceleration time of the E wave [144 (115–170) vs. 
176 (144–222) ms] (Table 2).
The low LS group had a significantly higher prevalence 
of the vascular failure pattern compared with the high LS 
group [38% vs. 20%] (Table 1). Furthermore, patients with 
a vascular failure pattern (n=31) had a significantly lower 
LS than those with a non-vascular failure pattern (n=74) 
[6.1 (5.2–9.6) vs. 10.4 (4.8–26.2) kPa, P=0.034].
LS and Clinical Outcomes
There were 42 (40%) cardiac events: 11 deaths from cardio￾vascular disease and 31 readmissions for HF during a 
median (IQR) follow-up period of 153 (83–231) days. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high LS group had 
a significantly higher rate of cardiac events (P=0.001 by 
log-rank test) (Figure 3A). Readmission for HF occurred 
in 20 patients (37%) in the high LS group and in 11 (21%) 
in the low LS group (P=0.022 by log-rank test) (Figure 3B). 
Cardiovascular death occurred in 13 patients (24%) in the 
high LS group and in 6 (11%) in the low LS group (P=0.088 
by log-rank test). Univariate Cox regression analysis 
revealed that cardiac events were strongly associated with 
previous hospitalization for HF (HR: 4.76, 95% CI: 2.24–
11.73, P<0.001), high LS ≥8.8kPa (HR: 2.71, 95% CI: 
1.43–5.43, P=0.001), and higher ln [LS] (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 
cardiovascular disease and readmission for HF), and hazard 
ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated. A multivariate model was used to adjust for the 
effect of variables related to organ congestion (ln [N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)], estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total bilirubin, γ-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), estimated RAP). Statistical analyses 
were conducted with JMP ver.11.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC, USA). P<0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results
Patients’ Characteristics
The median (IQR) LS was 8.8 (4.9–21.6) kPa. The clinical 
characteristics of patients divided into 2 groups according 
to the median LS (i.e., low LS <8.8kPa and high LS 
≥8.8kPa) are shown in Table 1. Age, sex, BP, prevalence of 
atrial fibrillation, and cause of HF did not differ significantly 
between these groups. The high LS group had higher doses 
of diuretics [40 (40–80) vs. 40 [40–40] mg] and inotropic 
drug infusion (24% vs. 3%) compared with the low LS 
group (both P<0.05). The high LS group also had higher 
total bilirubin [0.98 (0.51–1.86) vs. 0.62 (0.43–0.94) mg/dL], 
GGT [65 (31–157) vs. 22 (16–43) mg/dL], and MELD-XI 
score [12.5 (7.1–18.6) vs. 6.9 (4.1–13.2)], and lower total 
cholesterol [147 (124–159) vs. 160 (143–190) mg/dL] and 
platelet count [165 (123–208)×103/μL vs. 209 (158–267)×
103/μL] compared with the low LS group (all P<0.05). In 
echocardiographic data, the high LS group had a larger 
IVC diameter [22 (15–25) vs. 14 (10–17) mm], larger RVDd 
[ 41 (34–47) vs. 33 (27–36) mm], higher estimated RAP [15

estingly, the increase in LS was greater in patients with 
right-sided HF than in patients with stable left HF.16 A 
recent study showed that TE-derived LS may be a predictor 
of RV failure after LV assist device implantation,19 but the 
relationships of LS with underlying cardiac condition and 
outcomes are not fully understood in patients with ADHF.
In the current study, LS in ADHF patients was related 
to elevated RAP and TR severity, and negatively associated 
with TAPSE, as manifested by RV systolic function. 
Regarding parameters of left-sided HF, LS was related to 
both the LAd and E/A ratio, and negatively correlated 
with deceleration time. These findings suggest that LS in 
ADHF patients is also influenced by elevated LV filling 
pressure. In addition, the patients with high LS had higher 
doses of diuretics and inotropic drug infusion. In ADHF 
patients, left-sided HF often causes postcapillary pulmonary 
hypertension (PH) via increased LV filling pressure or 
pulmonary venous pressure.20 Persistent PH causes higher 
right heart pressure and right heart volume overload, leading 
to elevated RAP.20 Our findings suggested that high LS in 
ADHF patients is a robust marker of severe RV failure 
caused by right heart pressure and overload from postcap￾illary PH.
Patients with high LS in the current study also had 
higher bilirubin and GGT levels, lower total cholesterol, 
and higher MELD-XI scores, compared with those with 
low LS. Generally, HF is thought to cause hepatic conges￾tion via increased RAP,1 and liver dysfunction caused by 
hepatic congestion is referred to as congestive hepatopathy. 
Laboratory data for hepatic congestion mainly show 
cholestasis,2,21 with increased serum GGT, alkaline phos￾phatase, and bilirubin levels. Chronic liver congestion also

(HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00–1.00, P<0.001), alanine amino￾transferase (ALT) (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00–1.00, P=0.001), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04, 
P<0.001), and MELD-XI score (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03–
1.13, P<0.001) (Table 3). The significant association of 
high LS ≥8.8kPa with the incidence of death from cardio￾vascular disease and readmission for HF persisted in models 
adjusted for age, sex, and indices related to organ congestion 
(ln [NT-proBNP], BUN, eGFR, total bilirubin, GGT, 
estimated RAP) (Table 4).
Discussion
There were 2 major findings in this study. First, ADHF 
patients with higher LS had more elevated RAP (as assessed 
by echocardiography), hepatic congestion (total bilirubin, 
GGT), impaired hepatic synthesis (total cholesterol), and 
hepatic dysfunction (MELD-XI score). Second, high LS 
values were strongly associated with worse clinical out￾comes, independent of other indices of organ congestion.
TE measures LS based on the velocity of an elastic shear 
wave that propagates in the liver,14 and LS measured by 
TE correlates strongly with the degree of fibrosis in liver 
biopsy obtained in chronic liver disease.15 TE is a rapid, 
noninvasive and highly reproducible method.14,15 Because 
the liver is wrapped in a non-elastic capsule, liver congestion 
also leads to increased LS.6 Therefore, LS could be a 
marker of hepatic congestion or right-sided filling pressure 
in patients with general HF.7 Several groups have examined 
the effect of HF on the liver.16–18 In a clinical study, LS 
measured by TE increased in patients with HF, and inter￾Table 2. Echocardiographic Data Stratified According to Median LS Value

variables, such as RAP, severity of TR, pulmonary wedge 
pressure, and cardiac output,26 and is a strong predictor of 
adverse outcomes in HF.27 In addition, the MELD and 
MELD-XI scores predict all-cause death in patients with 
advanced HF.3,28 Our findings suggested that LS collectively 
reflects elevated RAP, liver congestion and liver injury, 
which are related to congestive hepatopathy, and thus, LS 
is an independent predictor of clinical outcome. TE is a 
simple, non-invasive, and user-friendly modality, and LS 
measured by TE may be useful for improving risk stratifi￾cation and clinical management of patients with ADHF.
A previous study reported a cutoff value of LS of 
10.6kPa for detection of RAP >10mmHg.7 Compared 
with that value, a median LS value of 8.8kPa is low, but 
the patients in this study presented with ADHF. There 
may be 2 reasons for the low median LS. First, 39% patients 
were in NYHA class II, and thus there is the possibility 
leads to liver damage and synthetic function impairment. 
Total cholesterol, albumin, and cholinesterase are markers 
of hepatic protein synthesis,22–24 while MELD-XI scores 
reflect liver damage caused by increased RAP.3,13,25 There￾fore, increased LS may reflect hepatic congestion induced 
by RV failure, impaired hepatic synthesis, and hepatic 
dysfunction.
Importantly, we showed that patients with ADHF with 
high LS (≥median) had poor clinical outcomes. Further￾more, high LS was a predictor of clinical outcome after 
adjustment for laboratory and echocardiographic indices 
reflecting organ congestion, such as total bilirubin, GGT, 
and estimated RAP. To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to evaluate the prognostic significance of LS measured 
by TE in patients with ADHF. In fact, previous reports 
have shown the effect of liver congestion on the prognosis 
of HF.26–28 Total bilirubin correlates with hemodynamic

substantial ascites. Third, LS data at discharge were not 
obtained, and a previous study showed that ADHF has a 
high in-hospital mortality rate.29 We only collected LS data 
at admission because the aim of the study was to investigate 
prediction of prognosis in ADHF patients using LS values, 
and we evaluated the prognostic value of LS for cardiac 
events, including in-hospital death. However, LS data at 
discharge may help with management of HF patients. 
Further studies are needed to clarify this issue. Finally, the 
study was performed at a single center and included a 
relatively small number of patients. Within these limitations, 
we conclude that increased LS values reflect RAP elevation, 
hepatic congestion, and hepatic dysfunction, and that LS 
upon admission may be a useful prognostic marker for 
cardiac events in patients with ADHF.

that mild HF patients were included in the study. Second, 
31 of 105 patients (29%) presented with vascular failure 
pattern onset, defined as SBP >140mmHg at admission,9
and patients with a vascular failure pattern had significantly 
lower LS than those with a non-vascular failure pattern. 
Furthermore, the low LS group had a significantly higher 
prevalence of a vascular failure pattern compared with the 
high LS group. This indicates that patients with low LS at 
admission tend to present with vascular failure and that 
organ congestion is not severe, compared with those with 
high LS.
Study Limitations
First, the underlying histology of liver fibrosis was not 
considered. However, no patients with liver dysfunction or 
chronic liver disease and none who consumed alcohol in 
excess (>20g/day) were included in the study. Second, LS 
is technically difficult to obtain accurately by TE in patients 
who are obese, have a narrow intercostal space, or have
