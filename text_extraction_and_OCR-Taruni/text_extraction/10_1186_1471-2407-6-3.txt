Abstract
Background: Although numerous chemotherapeutic agents have been tested, the role of
systemic chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clarified. New
therapeutic strategies are thus needed to improve outcomes, and we designed this study with new
effective drug combination.
Methods: Twenty-nine patients with histologically-confirmed, metastatic HCC received a
combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1, plus
capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day as an intermittent regimen of 2 weeks of treatment followed by a 1-
week rest.
Results: The median age was 49 years (range, 32–64) and 19 patients were hepatitis B virus
seropositive. Child-Pugh class was A in all patients and 4 had Zubrod performance status of 2. The
objective response rate was 24% (95% CI 9–40) with 6 stable diseases. The chemotherapy was
generally well tolerated despite one treatment-related death.
Conclusion: Combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine produced
modest antitumor activity with tolerable adverse effects in patients with metastatic HCC.
Background
In Korea, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for
12% of all malignancies and is one of the leading causes
of cancer death [1]. Metastatic HCC is associated with a
very poor prognosis. Although numerous chemothera￾peutic agents have been tested, the role of systemic chem￾otherapy for metastatic HCC has not been clarified [2,3].
Currently, doxorubicin is the most frequently used drug

either in single-agent or in combination [4-6]. Cisplatin
also has shown an objective response rate of 17% as sin￾gle-agent chemotherapy [7], and a higher response rate
when combined with epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
[8] or doxorubicin, interferon alpha and 5-FU [9]. Phase
II studies have shown that combination chemotherapy
with doxorubicin and cisplatin in metastatic HCC
patients showed modest antitumor activity with tolerable
adverse effects [10,11].
Capecitabine is a rationally designed, orally administered,
tumor-selective fluoropyrimidine that mimics continuous
infusion 5-FU, which is converted to 5-FU preferentially
in tumor tissue by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase
[12,13]. 5-FU is active in patients with HCC [5,6], and
most patients clearly prefer oral agents over infusional 5-
FU [14]. Furthermore, the low incidence of myelosuppres￾sion with capecitabine makes it an attractive agent for
incorporation into combination regimens with myelo￾suppressive agents, such as doxorubicin. It has been
reported that mild-to-moderated hepatic dysfunction in
patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases did not sig￾nificantly affect capecitabine pharmacokinetics [15].
Therefore, patients with underlying hepatic dysfunction
should be monitored closely during capecitabine treat￾ment, but no dose adjustment solely on the basis of this
condition is required.
Based on the demonstrated antitumor activities, different
mechanisms of action and toxicity profiles, we designed a
phase II study of combination chemotherapy with doxo￾rubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine in patients with meta￾static HCC anticipating a synergistic interaction of the
combination.
Methods
Patients
Patients, who were referred to the department of medical
oncology because of their metastatic and/or recurrent
HCC, were considered eligible for study entry. They were
required to have histologically confirmed, metastatic
HCC. All patients had a Zubrod performance status of 2 or
lower, a life expectancy of 16 weeks or more, an absolute
neutrophil count ≥1,500 mm-3 or more, and a platelet
count ≥100,000 mm-3. Other inclusion criteria included
an adequate renal (serum creatinine level < 2 mg dl-1) and
cardiac (left ventricular ejection fraction > 50% by
echocardiography) function, a Child-Pugh class A or B
[16], and a provision of a signed written informed con￾sent. Patients had to have at least one bidimensionally
measurable metastatic lesion other than primary HCC.
No prior systemic chemotherapy was allowed. This study
protocol was reviewed and approved by the Gil Medical
Center institutional review board.
Treatment
The regimen consisted of doxorubicin 60 mg m-2 deliv￾ered as an intravenous infusion over 30 min, followed by
cisplatin 60 mg m-2 infused over 1 h on day 1. Capecitab￾ine was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg m-2
twice daily as an intermittent regimen of 2 weeks of treat￾ment followed by a one-week rest. Each cycle of chemo￾therapy was given every 3 weeks if the patient's blood
count had returned to normal and non-hematologic toxic
effects had resolved. Treatment was repeated until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity was detected, or up to a
maximum of 6 cycles. Complete blood counts, blood
chemistry and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were
obtained before the beginning of each cycle. Dosage of the
subsequent cycles was adjusted according to the toxic
effects that developed during the preceding cycle. All
patients received standard supportive regimen consisting
of hydration and antiemetics. No prophylactic adminis￾tration of hematopoietic growth factors was allowed.
However, in cases of persistent viral replication, antiviral
treatment (i.e., lamivudine) was permitted.
Response and toxicity evaluation
Antitumor response was assessed every 2 cycles of chemo￾therapy and reviewed by an independent investigator later
at the time of analyses. The following WHO criteria were
used: 1) a complete response (CR) was defined as the dis￾appearance of all radiologic and clinical evidence of
tumor and absence of all tumor-related symptoms for at
least 4 weeks; 2) a partial response (PR) was defined as a
decrease of 50% or more in the product of the 2 greatest
perpendicular dimensions of measurable tumors meas￾ured at least 4 weeks apart; 3) stable disease (SD) was
defined as no significant change in radiologic tumor
measurements without no worsening in performance sta￾tus; and 4) progressive disease (PD) was defined as a
decline in performance status, the appearance of new
malignant lesions, and an increase of 25% or more in
measurable disease. Primary tumor was included for
response assessment. Toxicity grading was based on the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ver￾sion 2.
Statistical consideration
The primary end-point was the response rate, and the sec￾ondary measures were survival and time to progression.
Time to progression of disease was calculated from the
first cycle of chemotherapy. Survival was defined as the
time elapsed from the starting date of chemotherapy to
the date of death or the last follow-up. Survival rates and
time to progression were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier
method. All P values were two-sided, with P < 0.05 indi￾cating statistical significance. Sample size was calculated
to reject a 10% response rate in favor of a target response
rate of 30%, with a significance level of 0.05 and a power

of 80% by using Simon's optimal two-stage design [17].
In the initial stage, a total of 10 evaluable patients were to
be entered and evaluated for response. If more than one
response were observed in the first stage, then 19 addi￾tional patients were to be entered in the second stage to
achieve a target sample size of 29 evaluable patients. Fur￾ther assessment of the regimen was felt to be warranted if
more than five responses were observed in the 29 patients.
Results
A total of 29 patients were registered in the study between
January 2003 and September 2004, and 2 patients were
ineligible or never received protocol therapy. However, in
an intent-to-treat analysis, these patients were included in
the denominator for treatment outcomes. Patient charac￾teristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age was
49 years (range 32–64) and all patients had a good base￾line liver function (Child-Pugh class A). All patients had
at least one metastatic lesion, with intra-abdominal
lymph node, lung, or bone metastases present in 62%,
35% and 38%, respectively. The majority of patients had
received prior antitumor therapy. The most common pre￾vious treatment for HCC was transarterial chemoemboli￾zation, which was received by 16 of 29 patients (55%).
Nineteen patients were hepatitis B virus seropositive and
4 had Zubrod performance status of 2.
Treatment outcomes
Seven PRs were obtained (24%, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 9–40) with 6 SDs. Five patients who had a PR later
experienced disease progression. With a median follow￾up duration of 17.3 months, the median time to progres￾sion of all evaluable patients was 3.7 months (95% CI
1.9–5.6). Median overall survival was 7.7 months (95%
CI 3.7–11.7; Figure 1). Five of seven patients who
achieved a PR had a corresponding decrease in serum AFP
level by more than 50% as compared with the baseline
value, and one patient with a PR did not have elevated
serum AFP at baseline. Of 25 evaluable patients, 10 (40%)
showed more than 50% decrease in serum AFP level from
their baseline value and the median time to the AFP
response was 1.8 months (range 0.8–4.7). The median
survival in patients who showed a reduction in AFP level
by 50% was 10.3 months while that in other patients was
3.6 months (P = 0.07). Five patients had salvage treatment
with thalidomide after completion of chemotherapy.
Safety
In total, 98 cycles of chemotherapy were administered,
with a median of 3 cycles per patient (range 1–6), and 9
(9%) of the planned cycles were delayed because of toxic
effects. Dose reduction was required in 17 (17%) cycles.
All eligible patients were evaluable for toxic effects (Table
2). The most frequently encountered toxic effects were
gastrointestinal toxicities, which were managed with rest,
dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation. Only one
episode of febrile neutropenia was occurred. Hematologic
toxicities were infrequent and no patient received hemat￾opoietic growth factors. Three patients received platelet
transfusion during the treatment. Hand-foot skin rash
occurred in 17% of patients and was limited to low-grade
intensity. Although difficult to differentiate from the
symptoms of the underlying disease, severe hepatic dys￾function precluding further chemotherapy was observed
in 2 patients. Three patients refused further chemotherapy
after the first cycle due to prolonged nausea and/or ano￾rexia. One patient died after the second cycle due to hypo￾volemic shock which occurred as a complication of gastric
variceal bleeding. This event was thought unlikely to be
related to the chemotherapy because his platelet counts
were differed marginally from pre-treatment values
(>100,000 mm-3).
Discussion
HCC often develops among patients who have cirrhosis.
It is estimated that approximately 60% of all patients with
HCC have underlying cirrhosis [18]. In some patients, cir￾Table 1: Patient characteristics

rhosis associated with portal hypertension and thrombo￾cytopenia makes systemic chemotherapy for HCC
extremely difficult and contributes to the poor prognosis
associated with HCC. Furthermore, there is no prospective
controlled study suggesting that systemic chemotherapy
prolongs survival in HCC patients when compared with
best supportive care.
Single chemotherapeutic agents, which have demon￾strated a consistent response rate of more than 10% are
doxorubicin [4,19], 5-FU and cisplatin [5,6]. In a system￾atic review of clinical trials [3], the 1-year survival rate was
superior for doxorubicin-containing regimen over non￾doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. In a study using
PIAF regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-FU and interferon
alpha), 9 out of 50 HCC patients with PR were able to
receive surgical resection resulting in pathologic CR in 4
patients [9]. This indicates that aggressive systemic combi￾nation chemotherapy may result in CR for HCC patients.
However, the PIAF regimen was associated with consider￾able toxicities with significant myelosuppression, which
led to 2 treatment-related deaths. Triplet combination
with ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU) was also evalu￾ated in patients with HCC [20]. ECF chemotherapy gave a
modest response rate (15%) at the cost of considerable
hematologic toxicity.
In an attempt to achieve better tolerability and effective￾ness with doxorubicin-containing combination regimen,
we substituted 5-FU with capecitabine, which is consid￾ered to be as effective and more tolerable than 5-FU [21-
23]. Although capecitabine has not been compared to
infusional 5-FU to prove similar efficacy, oral administra￾tion has the advantage of permitting convenient, patient￾orientated therapy, providing the patient with a degree of
independence and improved quality of life, while avoid￾ing complications associated with intravenous drug
administration. Furthermore, most patients prefer orally
administered therapy to intravenous treatment [14]. The
presence of mild-to-moderate hepatic dysfunction had no
clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of
capecitabine and its metabolites [15]. These findings sug￾gest that capecitabine may be useful for patients with
HCC [24], including those with impaired hepatic func￾tion.
The combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin and capecitab￾ine was well tolerated by patients with metastatic HCC. It
should be kept in mind that the degree of cirrhosis was
limited to Child-Pugh class A; none of the treated patients
had class B or C cirrhosis. Using this triplet combination,
we achieved an overall response rate of 24% and a median
time to progression of 3.7 months. Forty percent of
patients showed a significant reduction in serum AFP in
this study. This observation should be interpreted with
caution because it represents only a small group of
patients with metastatic HCC in this phase II study and
the majority of patients had good performance status and
preserved hepatic function. As a result, grade 3 or 4 neu￾tropenia occurred only in 14% of patients. This favorable
toxicity profile achieved with triplet chemotherapy dif￾fered from results reported with other doxorubicin-based
chemotherapy for HCC. Although it would be difficult to
compare our data directly with the results of other studies,
a survival benefit from our triplet combination in HCC
seems unlikely, despite the acceptable response rate and
favorable toxicity profile observed in our study. The
response rate of our regimen is comparable to those found
in most phase II studies of doxorubicin-based combina￾tion chemotherapy ranging from 13% to 26% [4-
6,19,20]. Capecitabine monotherapy was also evaluated
in a phase II study, resulting in a modest response rate and
good tolerability [24]. Recently, Yeo et al. have conducted
a phase III study comparing single-agent doxorubicin with
PIAF in patients with inoperable HCC [25]. There was no
significant difference in response rates and overall survival
between doxorubicin and PIAF. To date, none of combi￾Overall survival and time to progression Figure 1

nation regimens has been recognized as a standard or
superior to doxorubicin alone.
With few exceptions, it is generally conceived that sys￾temic chemotherapy is relatively ineffective in HCC [26].
HCC is resistant to chemotherapy because of the high
mutational load it carries and the myriads of drug resist￾ance mechanisms [27,28]. This is in addition to the
underlying liver dysfunction that imposes lower chemo￾therapy doses to mitigate toxicity. More recently, targeted
therapeutics are being looked at aggressively in HCC. Sev￾eral potential targets along the angiogenesis and the signal
transduction pathway are evaluated in HCC. These
include epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte
growth factor and its receptor c-met, and vascular
endothelial growth factor [29]. Bortezomib, considered as
a potent and reversible inhibitor of the proteasome, was
also evaluated in a phase I/II study [30]. Interestingly,
bortezomib attenuates certain pathways implicating in
resistance to anthracyclines, and thus, a significant syn￾ergy between bortezomib and anthracyclines was
observed [31]. Our next step will be to combine doxoru￾bicin with bortezomib and to investigate the relative place
of the targeted therapy in the treatment of metastatic
HCC.
Conclusion
Despite recent advances in our understanding of its genet￾ics and treatment, HCC remains a deadly disease.
Although preventive efforts are important, further studies
are needed to identify agents that possess more potent
activity against HCC. In the current phase II study, the tri￾plet combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin and capecitab￾ine is active chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic
HCC. Further options include additional clinical studies
involving novel targeted agents in combination with cyto￾toxic chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin.
