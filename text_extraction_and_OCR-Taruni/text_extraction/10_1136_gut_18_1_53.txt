study of acute pancreatitis

SUMMARY A prospective study of 116 patients with acute pancreatitis included routine screening
for evidence of viral infection. Five patients (all female) exhibited significant rising antibody titres
to Coxsackie B or mumpsvirus, while none of the remaining 111 patients did. Diarrhoea was a pro￾dromal feature of the pancreatitis in those patients with evidence of viral disease. Screening patients
with acute pancreatitis for Coxsackie B and mumpsvirus infections is worthwhile in the identifica￾tion of aetiological factors and may minimise protracted biliary investigations. The incidence of
'idiopathic' acute pancreatitis in this study was 5-2% (six patients).
Recent prospective studies of acute pancreatitis
(Ranson et al., 1974; Imrie and Whyte, 1975) have
indicated that the group of patients considered to
have 'idiopathic' acute pancreatitis represent no
more than 12% of the total cases. The two common
aetiological factors associated with acute pancreatitis
in over 75 % of patients are biliary disease and excess
alcohol ingestion (Ranson et al., 1974; Howes
et al., 1975; Imrie and Whyte, 1975). Hyperlipo￾proteinaemia, hyperparathyroidism, steroids, hypo￾thermia, and pancreatic neoplasm are aetiological
factors in a small percentage of cases.
It is well recognised that acute pancreatitis may
be associated with mumps infection (Joske, 1955;
Melin and Ursing, 1958) and the agent responsible
for infective hepatitis may occasionally cause
accompanying pancreatitis (Lisney, 1943; Joske,
1955; Achord, 1968; Gillespie, 1973; Ham and
Fitzpatrick, 1974). Coxsackie B viruses have been
reported to cause acute pancreatitis (Kibrick and
Benirschke, 1958; Fechner et al., 1963; Murphy
and Simmul, 1964; Ursing, 1973) and, in an out￾break of Coxsackie B5 induced aseptic meningitis
in children, a positive result was obtained in 31 %
of those screened for raised amylase in blood and/or
urine (Nakao et al., 1964). In addition, it has clearly
been shown that Coxsackie B virus infections in
animals cause acute pancreatitis (Pappenheimer
et al., 1951; Burch et al., 1971; Tsui et al., 1972;
Ross et al., 1974).
Recently it has been shown that moderately
Received for publication 6 August 1976
raised antibody titres to Coxsackie B are present in
some patients with pancreatitis but the authors
concluded that no case in their series was caused by
acute viral infection (Capner et al., 1975). They
suggest a selective anamnestic response, or low
grade infection, or common determinants between
pancreatic and Coxsackie antigens may explain their
observations. Similar antibody responses, without
definite evidence of acute infection, have been found
to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Leinikki et al., 1973)
but acute pancreatitis has also been described as a
complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection
(Mardh and Ursing, 1974).
In order to investigate further the small group of
'idiopathic' patients and the role of virus infection
in acute pancreatitis, routine screening for viral
antibodies was included as part of a prospective
study of acute pancreatitis performed in one
hospital over a period of two years.
Methods
One-hundred-and-sixteen patients admitted to
Glasgow Royal Infirmary were included in the
study. The criteria for diagnosis of acute pancrea￾titis have already been described (Imrie and Whyte,
1975). Acute and convalescent phase clotted blood
samples were assayed for mumps and Coxsackie B
virus antibody titres, the acute sample being taken in
the first week of illness and the convalescent sample
after the second week (Table 1).
All 116 patients were screened for biliary disease,
and specifically questioned to obtain an estimate of

regular alcohol intake, and of intake immediately
before the attack of acute pancreatitis. During and
after the illness full metabolic screening for hyper￾parathyroidism and hyperlipoproteinaemia was
performed.
Mumps antibodies were titrated by complement
fixation test (CFT), using commercial v & s antigens
and allowing fixation to occur for 18 hours at 4°C.
using 2 units of complement and 50% end point
readings. Reciprocal titres are shown in Table 1.
Antibody titres to Coxsackie B1-6 were assayed
by an immunofluorescent (FA) method which
has been described previously (McLure et al.,
1972). Infected VERO cells were used as substrate,
with viral antigen present in approximately 50%,
after incubation for 18 hours at 37°C. Replicate
spots were placed on microscope slides so that
dilutions of serum from 1:2 through 1:256 could be
tested on a single slide. Slides were stored at - 180°C
after air drying and fixing in acetone, before use for
titrations. Serum dilutions were made in micro￾titre 'U' plates. The indirect FA method was used
throughout. Incubation of each step was for 30
minutes at 37°C. Rabbit anti-human:FITC coupled
serum was purchased from Nordic Pharmaceuticals.
This was used at 4 units and had 1 0 mg naph￾thalene black added per millilitre of working dilu￾tion. No non-specific fluorescence was present.
Appropriate positive and negative controls were
included in every batch of titrations. Fifty per cent
end-points were used and reciprocal titres are
shown in Table 1. Readings of FA titres were made
on a Wild M20 fluorescence microscope fitted with a
Balzer FITC interference filter as exciter and a
Kodak Wratten 12 gelatin filter as barrier. Each
serum was titrated by this method against cells
preinfected with Coxsackie viruses B1-6.
Results
Of the 116 patients studied, five had significant
rising antibody titres to mumpsvirus or one or
more Coxsackie B viruses, while 111 patients
exhibited no rising titres (Table 2). All five patients
were female and all Australia antigen negative.
Two patients had rising antibody titres to mumps￾virus and two patients had rising antibody titres to
Coxsackie B viruses types B3, 4, or 5. One patient
had positive titres to mumps V and Coxsackie B5
(Tables 1, 3). In those patients with rising antibody
titres to mumpsvirus, two were positive to V antigen
(cases 3 and 5) and one to S antigen (case 4).
Good evidence of biliary disease was present in
two of the five patients (cases 1 and 4; Table 3) and
none of the five had any evidence of excess alcohol
intake, hyperlipoproteinaemia, hyperparathyroid￾ism, or other known aetiological factor. The rises
in serum amylase on admission are indicated in
Table 3, showing that only one patient did not
record a serum amylase level greater than four times
the upper limit of normal (normal serum amylase
70-300 IU/l). A marginal rise in both serum amylase
and amylase clearance was present in this case
after a 72 hour history of excessive vomiting and

Coxsackie and mumpsvirus infection in a prospective study of acute pancreatitis 55
only six hour history of severe acute epigastric pain.
Laparotomy was therefore carried out and this
confirmed the presence of acute pancreatitis and no
other intra-abdominal pathology. Postoperative
progress was satisfactory and she was discharged
well after two weeks. The remaining four patients
were all successfully managed through their acute
pancreatitis.
The evidence for biliary disease in one of these
five patients was conclusive and cholecystectomy
has now been carried out, while in the second patient
oral cholecystography has been performed on two
occasions and the gall bladder has failed to outline.
In view of her age, no further biliary investigation
or surgery is proposed.
The presence of a prodromal illness would be
compatible with a possible viral aetiology in a case of
acute pancreatitis and it is therefore notable that
four of the five patients had clearly defined prodromal
signs and symptoms, not usually associated with the
onset of acute pancreatitis. Diarrhoea preceded the
abdominal pain in four patients and in the remaining
patient (case 3) no accurate preceding history to her
illness was obtained because of amnesia for the
period before admission in coma and renal
failure.
None of those patients with positive mumps
antibody titres exhibited signs of parotid or gonadal
involvement. Other stigmata of acute viral infections
were not observed.
Discussion
The finding of significant rising antibody titres in
five patients with acute pancreatitis is good evidence
of concurrent viral infection. In two of those five,
evidence of biliary disease was also present. It is
impossible to ascertain the relative roles of gall
stones and viral infection in the onset of a particular
attack of this disease in an individual patient, and
double aetiological factors in a single case are not
uncommon (Imrie 1974). The remaining three
patients had no other aetiological factor identified
after complete investigation.
The finding that three of the nine patients with no
putative precipitating factor had concurrent viral
infection, and two of the 107 with a known aetio￾logical factor also had evidence of viral infection
suggests that a minority of cases of acute pancreatitis
are caused by infection with mumps or a Coxsackie
B virus.
The exact manner in which the viruses may attack
the pancreas is as yet uncertain. Oedema of the
papilla of Vater and pancreatic ducts has been
suggested in the human (Ursing, 1973) but from the
experimental work done in rats and mice (Pappen￾heimer et al., 1951; Burch et al., 1971; Tsui et al.,
1972; Ross et al., 1974) a direct attack on the acinar
cell would appear to be the more likely explanation,
at least in the experimental animal.
We have concerned ourselves in this study only
with patients who exhibited high CF titres to Cox￾sackie B and mumpsvirus. However, we have noted
a similar experience to that of other workers (Leinikki
et al., 1973; Capner et al., 1975) regarding moderate
CF titre rises to Coxsackie B and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae occasionally occurring in acute pancrea￾titis patients. Therefore we support their contentions
that a selective anamnestic response may be an
accompaniment of acute pancreatitis or that pan￾creatic antigens (released during acute pancreatitis)
may share common determinants with Coxsackie B
and mycoplasma pneumoniae antigens.
With regard to the overall role of viral factors in
the aetiology of acute pancreatitis, this prospective
study has shown that a small percentage of cases
may have a viral aetiology of Coxsackie or mumps￾virus grouping. This represents an important
proportion of the small group of patients with so￾called idiopathic acute pancreatitis.
We wish to thank all the consultants in the Surgical
and Medical Divisions of Glasgow Royal Infirmary
for permission to study patients admitted under
their care.

Addendum
Since this paper was submitted we have admitted a 31 year old teetotal male librarian with acute pan￾creatitis and no prodromal illness. Admission serum amylase was 10 000 U/I and Coxsackie B2 titres rose
from an initial titre of 64 to 128 on the ninth day of illness, representing good evidence of concurrent in￾fection. Full screening for other aetiological factors has been negative and at later follow-up the Coxsackie
B2 titre was 32. There have been no late complications to his illness.
