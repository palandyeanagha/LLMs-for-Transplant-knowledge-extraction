Abstract
Background: Finding duplicates is an important phase of systematic review. However, no consensus regarding the methods
to find duplicates has been provided. This study aims to describe a pragmatic strategy of combining auto- and hand￾searching duplicates in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of duplicates.
Methods and Findings: Literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) were searched
by the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. Duplicates included one index paper and one or more redundant
papers. They were divided into type-I (duplicates among different databases) and type-II (duplicate publications in different
journals/issues) duplicates. For type-I duplicates, reference items were further compared between index and redundant
papers. Of 10936 papers regarding PVT, 2399 and 1307 were identified as auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively.
The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 11.0% (1201/10936) and 6.1% (665/10936), respectively.
They included 3431 type-I and 275 type-II duplicates. Of 11403 papers regarding BCS, 3275 and 2064 were identified as
auto- and hand-searched duplicates, respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 14.4%
(1640/11403) and 9.1% (1039/11403), respectively. They included 5053 type-I and 286 type-II duplicates. Most of type-I
duplicates were identified by auto-searching method (69.5%, 2385/3431 in PVT literatures; 64.6%, 3263/5053 in BCS
literatures). Nearly all type-II duplicates were identified by hand-searching method (94.9%, 261/275 in PVT literatures; 95.8%,
274/286 in BCS literatures). Compared with those identified by auto-searching method, type-I duplicates identified by hand￾searching method had a significantly higher prevalence of wrong items (47/2385 versus 498/1046, p,0.0001 in PVT
literatures; 30/3263 versus 778/1790, p,0.0001 in BCS literatures). Most of wrong items originated from EMBASE database.
Conclusion: Given the inadequacy of a single strategy of auto-searching method, a combined strategy of auto- and hand￾searching methods should be employed to find duplicates in systematic review.

Introduction
Systematic review is characterized as explicitly formulated,
reproducible, and up-to-date summary of the effects of health care
interventions [1,2]. It provides the top level of evidence for clinical
decision [3,4]. More than 2500 new systematic reviews every year
can be retrieved in PubMed [5]. Compared with the traditional
narrative review, the most prominent specialty of the systematic
review is that literature search is comprehensive and literature
selection is unbiased. Recently, the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement has
recommended that a four-phase flow diagram should be employed
for literature search and selection in systematic review [1]. The
first phase is to identify all relevant literatures through databases
and subsequently to remove the duplicates simultaneously
recorded by different databases or published by different journals.
The process of finding duplicates among databases is so critical
that the researchers can avoid the repetitive evaluation of data
from the same study and the readers can accurately understand
the quantity of scientific publications in the field. Based on our
previous systematic reviews [6,7,8,9], a high prevalence of
duplicates can be frequently observed among different databases.
More importantly, not all duplicates can be readily found, because
wrong information is occasionally recorded. However, no consen￾sus regarding the methods to find duplicates and the prevalence of
duplicates among different databases has been given yet.
Herein, we attempted to describe our methods to find duplicates
among the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases
in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and
characteristics of duplicates.
Methods
Literature search
Literatures in two fields were retrieved to minimize the potential
selection bias. They included ‘‘portal vein thrombosis’’ and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71838

‘‘Budd-Chiari syndrome’’ literatures. The selection of the two
fields was primarily attributed to our research interests in the two
vascular disorders of the liver [6,7,8,9,10,11]. QX searched the
PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases (from the
database inception to November 12, 2012). Our search strategy
aimed to maximize the quantity of literatures recorded by these
databases. The search items were discussed by all review authors.
For the literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis, the search
items were: (portal vein thrombosis) OR (portal venous thrombo￾sis) OR (portal vein obstruction) OR (portal venous obstruction).
For the literatures regarding Budd-Chiari syndrome, the search
items were: (budd chiari) OR (hepatic vein obstruction) OR
(hepatic venous obstruction) OR (hepatic vein thrombosis) OR
(hepatic venous thrombosis).
Definitions and classifications of duplicates
Duplicates were divided into type I (duplicates among databases)
and II (duplicate publications). Type I duplicates were defined as
one paper was simultaneously recorded in one database twice or
more times or in two or three databases (see examples in
Table 1). Type II duplicates were defined as one study was
published in different journals or issues. According to the type of
publication, type II duplicates were classified as Abstract-Abstract,
Abstract-Full text, and Full text-Full text. The first two types were
often permitted, but the last one type was unethical in most of
cases [12] (see examples in Table 2).
Duplicates consisted of one index paper and one or more
redundant papers. For type I duplicates, index paper was
considered as one paper of the duplicates had more accurate
and/or adequate reference information; and for type II duplicates,
index paper was considered as one paper of the duplicates was
published earlier and/or had a larger sample size [13]. According
to the number of redundant papers, duplicates were classified as
follows: double duplicates were defined if only one redundant
paper was found, triple duplicates if two redundant papers were
found, quadruple duplicates if three redundant papers were found,
and so on. According to the origin of index and redundant papers,
duplicates were classified as PubMed-PubMed, PubMed-EM￾BASE, PubMed-Cochrane, EMBASE-EMBASE, EMBASE-Co￾chrane, Cochrane-Cochrane, and PubMed-EMBASE-Cochrane.
Auto-search duplicates
QX imported all literatures retrieved by the three databases into
an Endnote library (ENDNOTE X3, Thomson Reuters, USA). All
literatures were expressed in Vancouver reference type. In the
Endnote library, QX used the ‘‘Find Duplicates’’ command on the
‘‘References’’ menu to identify the auto-searched duplicates among
the three databases. Prior to this step, ‘‘Find Duplicates’’ preferences
could be defined on the ‘‘Edit’’ menu. To maximize the quantity of
auto-searched duplicates, our preference was consistent with the
Endnote default setting. In this setting, duplicates were identified
as references of the same reference type with matching ‘‘author’’,
‘‘title’’, and ‘‘publication date’’ items, but ‘‘journal’s name’’,
‘‘volume’’, ‘‘issue’’, and ‘‘page’’ items were not compared. QX
further verified the accuracy of auto-searched duplicates.
Hand-search duplicates
After auto-searched redundant papers were removed, the
remaining literatures were alphabetically ordered according to
the first authors’ names. Then, duplicates were identified among
the literatures by the same first author. In details, if
Notably, if the first author’s name was wrongly spelt or missing
or the authors’ order was reversed in some database, we would
miss some duplicates. Accordingly, to minimize the quantity of
missed duplicates, the literatures were also alphabetically ordered
according to the titles. Then, duplicates were identified among the
literatures with the same titles. YM and JJ were responsible for the
literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis, and QX and RW for
the literatures regarding Budd-Chiari syndrome. QX and YM
were also responsible for rechecking the accuracy of their tasks.
Disagreement would be resolved by discussion among the four
review authors.
Difference between index and redundant papers of type
I duplicates
We just compared the difference of reference items between
index and redundant papers of type I duplicates, but not type II
duplicates. This behavior was primarily attributed to the fact that
nearly all type II duplicates had different journal’s name, volume,
issue, and page between index and redundant papers. QX and
YM extracted the detailed information of type I duplicates (i.e.,
author, title, journal’s name, publication date, volume, issue, and
page) into an Excel table (Microsoft Office Excel 2003, Microsoft
Corporation, USA). Then, QX and YM compared the difference
of reference items between index and redundant papers, and
identified ‘‘acceptable or unacceptable’’ duplicate publications in
order to distinguish whether or not they had wrong information.
Difference between index and redundant paper(s) would be
considered acceptable to readers and reference reviewers, if the
information was expressed in different styles. These different styles
included: 1) punctuation, space, or case was different; 2) author’s
middle name was omitted; 3) title of non-English language paper
and non-English language journal’s name were translated into
different words, but their meanings were identical; 4) journal’s
name was expressed in full or abbreviated style; 5) publication date
was expressed in ‘‘year’’ or ‘‘year month (day)’’ style; and 6)
volume, issue, or page was expressed in different styles, but their
meanings were identical (see examples in Table 1).
Difference between index and redundant paper(s) would be
considered unacceptable to readers and reference reviewers, if the
information was wrongly expressed. These wrong styles included:
1) author’s name and order, title of English language paper, and/
or journal’s name was wrongly recorded, added, or missing; and 2)
publication date, volume, issue, and/or page was wrong or missing
(see examples in Table 1). QX further obtained the full-texts of
the corresponding papers to identify the database which the wrong
information originated from. In the cases where some full-text
papers could not be obtained, we were uncertain about which
database the wrong information originated from.
Data analysis
The count data and/or percentage were reported in texts or bar
charts. The prevalence of duplicates with 95% confidence intervals
(CI) was calculated as follows:

Duplicates in Systematic Review
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71838

The proportion of type I and II duplicates was compared
between auto-searching and hand-searching methods. The prev￾alence of different and wrong items in type I duplicates was
compared between auto-searching and hand-searching methods.
Two-tailed P values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant.
The statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill).
Results
Portal vein thrombosis literatures
Overall, 10936 papers were identified via the three databases,
including 6733 from PubMed database, 4002 from EMBASE
database, and 201 from Cochrane library database (Figure 1A).
Auto-searched duplicates. Initially, 2401 papers were
identified as auto-searched duplicates. Notably, 2 papers with
the same author, title, and publication date were excluded from
duplicates, because both of them reported different contexts in
different issues. Thus, 2399 papers were auto-searched duplicates,
including 1198 index papers and 1201 redundant papers
(Table 3). The prevalence of auto-searched redundant papers
was 11.0% (95%CI: 10.4%–11.6%).
Of 2385 type I duplicates, 14 had the completely same items
between index and redundant papers. The remaining 2371
duplicates had at least one different item between index and
redundant papers. Publication date (92.8%, 2213/2385) was the
most commonly different item, followed by journal’s name (88.7%,
2115/2385), title (31.2%, 744/2385), page (5.8%, 139/2385),
issue (3.0%, 71/2385), volume (0.9%, 21/2385), and author
(0.6%, 14/2385) (Table 4). Only 2.0% (47/2385) of duplicates
were considered unacceptable due to wrong information. Page
(1.8%, 43/2385) was the most commonly wrong item, followed by
issue (1.0%, 23/2385), volume (0.9%, 21/2385), publication date
(0%, 0/2385), journal’s name (0%, 0/2385), title (0%, 0/2385),
and author (0%, 0/2385).
EMBASE database had the highest proportion of wrong
information regarding page, issue, and volume items (Figure 2A).

Hand-searched duplicates. After auto-searched redundant
papers were removed, 1307 papers were further identified as
hand-searched duplicates, including 642 index papers and 665
redundant papers (Table 3). The prevalence of hand-searched
redundant papers was 6.1% (95%CI: 5.6%–6.5%).
Of 1046 type I duplicates, all had at least one different item
between index and redundant papers. Journal’s name (87.1%,
909/1046) was the most commonly different item in hand￾searched duplicates, followed by publication date (82.1%, 857/
1046), author (53.2%, 555/1046), title (52.3%, 546/1046), page
(22.1%, 231/1046), volume (15.4%, 161/1046), and issue (3.3%,

(0.4%, 4/1046).
EMBASE database had the highest proportion of wrong
information regarding author, title, journal, and publication date
items. Cochrane library database had the highest proportion of
wrong information regarding volume and page items. PubMed
database had the highest proportion of wrong information
regarding issue item (Figure 2B).
Comparison. The number of duplicates identified by auto￾searching methods was larger than that identified by hand￾searched duplicates (2399 versus 1307). Most of type I duplicates
were identified by auto-searching methods (69.5%, 2385/3431).
The proportion of type I duplicates among the auto-searched
duplicates was significantly higher than that among the hand￾searched duplicates (2385/2399 versus 1046/1307, p,0.0001).
Nearly all type II duplicates were identified by hand-searching
methods (94.9%, 261/275). The proportion of type II duplicates
among the auto-searched duplicates was significantly lower than
that among the hand-searched duplicates (14/2399 versus 261/
1307, p,0.0001).
Compared with those identified by auto-searching methods,
type I duplicates identified by hand-searching methods had a
significantly higher prevalence of different and wrong items
(different items: 2371/2385 versus 1046/1046, p = 0.008; wrong
items: 47/2385 versus 498/1046, p,0.0001).
Budd-Chiari syndrome literatures
Overall, 11403 papers were identified via the three databases,
including 5894 from PubMed database, 5278 from EMBASE
database, and 231 from Cochrane library database (Figure 1B).
Auto-searched duplicates. 3275 papers were identified and
verified as auto-searched duplicates, including 1635 index papers

and 1640 redundant papers (Table 3). The prevalence of auto￾searched redundant papers was 14.4% (95%CI: 13.7%–15.0%).
Of 3263 type I duplicates, 18 had the completely same items
between index and redundant papers. The remaining 3245
duplicates had at least one different item between index and
redundant papers. Publication date (94.7%, 3091/3263) was the
most commonly different item, followed by journal’s name (87.3%,
2847/3263), title (31.0%, 1011/3263), page (4.7%, 154/3263),
issue (4.1%, 133/3263), author (0.9%, 28/3263), and volume
(0.6%, 20/3263) (Table 2). Only 0.9% (30/3263) of duplicates
were considered unacceptable due to wrong information. Page
(0.9%, 30/3263) was the most commonly wrong item, followed by
issue (0.6%, 18/3263), volume (0.5%, 16/3263), publication date
(0%, 0/3263), journal’s name (0%, 0/3263), title (0%, 0/3263),

Hand-searched duplicates. After 1640 auto-searched re￾dundant papers were removed, 2064 papers were further
identified as hand-searched duplicates, including 1025 index
papers and 1039 redundant papers (Table 3). The prevalence of
hand-searched redundant papers was 9.1% (95%CI: 8.6%–9.6%).
Of 1790 type I duplicates, all had at least one different item
between index and redundant papers. Journal’s name (85.1%,

proportion of wrong information regarding volume, issue, and
page items (Figure 2D).
Comparison. The prevalence of duplicates identified by
auto-searching methods was significantly higher than that
identified by hand-searching methods (3275/11403 versus 2064/
11403, p,0.0001). Most of type I duplicates were identified by
auto-searching methods (64.6%, 3263/5053). The proportion of
type I duplicates among the auto-searched duplicates was
significantly higher than that among the hand-searched duplicates
(3263/3275 versus 1790/2064, p,0.0001). Nearly all type II

Figure 3. Simplified scheme to identify duplicates in systematic review. The scheme includes the third main steps. First, all literatures
retrieved from different databases are combined into one Endnote library. In this Endnote library, ‘‘Find Duplicates’’ preferences are defined on ‘‘Edit’’
menu. Thus, duplicates can be automatically searched by Endnote library. Subsequently, the review authors should check the accuracy and identify
the type of duplicates. Finally, the redundant papers are excluded. Considering that a single strategy of auto-searching method was inadequate,
additional search should be very necessary. Second, the remaining literatures are alphabetically ordered according to the first authors’ names in the
Endnote library. If the first authors were the same between two or more articles, the review authors would further read the titles, journals’ names,

(different items: 3245/3263 versus 1790/1790, p = 0.001; wrong
items: 30/3263 versus 778/1790, p,0.0001).
Discussion
Finding duplicates among different databases is an indispens￾able and important phase of systematic review. The phase is not as
easy as we expected according to our previous experiences of
systematic reviews [6,7,8,9]. However, little attention has been
paid to this phase. To our knowledge, this study is the first
systematic analysis of duplicates among the three databases
commonly used by systematic review (i.e., PubMed, EMBASE,
and Cochrane library database). We attempted to devise a scheme
to identify duplicates in a systematic review (Figure 3). In this
scheme, we employed two methods to find duplicates (i.e., auto￾search and hand-search duplicates) and two approaches to find
hand-searched duplicates (i.e., alphabetical order of literatures
according to the first authors and titles). Indeed, the process of
auto-searching duplicates can be easily accomplished by Endnote
library software. By comparison, the process of hand-searching
duplicates is really a time-consuming and careful work. Four
review authors spent more than four weeks on finding hand￾searched duplicates, and two of them also paid another two weeks
for checking the accuracy of these works. Certainly, further studies
should be designed to assess the practical utility of this method in
systematic review.
A major finding of our study was that a large number of
duplicates could be found among the three databases in systematic
review. Notably, about 10% of literatures remained duplicates
among the three databases after auto-searching duplicates, which
strongly suggested the necessity of hand-searching duplicates in
systematic review.
We further compared the difference of reference items between
index and redundant papers of type I duplicates. Nearly all type I
duplicates had different items between index and redundant
volumes, issues, and pages. Subsequently, if these articles had the same titles, journals’ names, and issues, they would be attributed to the type I
duplicates. Notably, the review authors should identify whether the difference between index and redundant papers was acceptable or not. On the
other hand, if these had the same or similar titles but different journals or issues, the review authors would further read the abstracts and/or full-texts
to judge whether or not they could be attributed to the type II duplicates. Third, the remaining literatures were also alphabetically ordered according
to the titles in the Endnote library. If the titles were the same between two or more articles, the review authors would further read the journals’
names, volumes, issues, and pages. Subsequently, if these articles had the same journals’ names and issues, they would be attributed to type I
duplicates. Notably, the review authors should identify whether the difference between index and redundant papers was acceptable or not. On the
other hand, if these articles had the same or similar titles but different journals or issues, the review authors would further read the abstracts and/or
full-texts to judge whether or not they could be attributed to the type II duplicates. Finally, review authors should check the accuracy.

papers. Regardless of the literatures regarding portal vein
thromobosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome and auto-searched or
hand-searched duplicates, ‘‘journal’s name’’, ‘‘publication date’’,
and ‘‘title’’ were three most commonly different items. Most of
them were acceptable, for example, journal’s name was expressed
in full or abbreviated style, publication date was expressed in
‘‘year’’ or ‘‘year month’’ style, and titles used different punctua￾tions and/or cases in different databases. This finding could be
potentially explained by the fact that each database had its own
special reference type. Other items were uncommon, but were
mostly unacceptable. For example, author, volume, issue, or page
was wrong or missing. These mistakes should be corrected,
thereby decreasing the prevalence of type I duplicates.
In addition, our study explored the origin of wrong information
in type I duplicates. Regardless of the literatures regarding portal
vein thrombosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome, EMBASE database
had the highest proportion of wrong information regarding
author, title, journal, and publication date items. These mistakes
in EMBASE database were severe (see examples in Table 1),
because they not only misled the readers but also disrespected the
researchers. Cochrane library database had the highest proportion
of wrong information regarding volume and page items in type I
duplicates. This was primarily due to the reference type of
Cochrane library database (volume and page were not provided).
By comparison, only a minority of wrong information in type I
duplicates originated from PubMed database. These findings
suggested the following: 1) the accuracy of reference information
recorded by EMBASE database should be substantially improved;
and 2) the same reference type among these databases may be
beneficial for literature screening.
Auto-searching methods could identify a larger number of
duplicates, especially type I duplicates. However, only a very small
proportion of type II duplicates could be identified by auto￾searching methods (5.1% in portal vein thrombosis literatures; and
4.8% in Budd-Chiari syndrome literatures). This phenomenon
could be readily explained by the fact that the authors, titles, and
publication years were often different between index and
redundant papers among type II duplicates. Additionally, the
wrong reference items were rarely observed among type I
duplicates identified by auto-searching methods, but very
frequently among those identified by hand-searching methods.
This finding also suggested the limitation of auto-searching
duplicates, in which ‘‘author’’, ‘‘title’’, and ‘‘publication date’’
items should be exactly matched between two literatures.
Accordingly, the necessity of combining auto- and hand-searching
methods should be fully recognized in finding duplicates in
systematic reviews.
Limitations
Several limitations of this study should be clearly recognized.
First, the selection of portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari
syndrome literatures was based on our subjectivity. Accordingly,
the conclusions achieved by analyzing these literatures might be
unsuitable for the literatures from other fields. But it should be
noted that we employed a comprehensive search strategy and
literatures of two fields to strengthen our conclusions. And given
that the results were similar between portal vein thrombosis and
Budd-Chiari syndrome literatures, it was possible that these
findings of our study might be generalizable. Certainly, further
studies should be warranted to compare the frequency of wrong
information from a random sample of literatures among the three
databases. Second, only three databases were searched in our
study. This behavior might underestimate the prevalence of
duplicates among databases. However, given that PubMed,
EMBASE, and Cochrane library were three most common
databases used for systematic review, our results should be a
representative sample. Third, only two approaches were employed
in this study to identify hand-searched duplicates. It was not easy
to find duplicates as both the first author’s name and title were
different between index and redundant papers. Thus, the
prevalence of duplicates might be underestimated. Fourth, a
minority of full texts could not be obtained to identify the origin of
wrong information. However, it should be noted that we tried our
best to contact with the authors and seek help from our and other
University libraries. And these unavailable full texts did not
substantially influence our judgment on the proportion of wrong
information in different databases.
Conclusions
In conclusions, a high prevalence of duplicates could be
identified among the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library
databases in systematic review. These findings were primarily
attributed to the effect of a pragmatic strategy of combining auto￾and hand-searching methods to find duplicates. Indeed, a single
strategy of auto-searching method was inadequate to find
duplicates, especially type II duplicates. In general, to enhance
the transparency of systematic review, PRISMA might require the
reporting of the detailed information regarding the methods to
find duplicates and the quantity of duplicates identified by
different methods. In addition, considering that wrong reference
items were frequently observed in type I duplicates identified by
hand-searching methods, we strongly recommended that the
information of every reference should be strictly examined and
carefully inputted by database administrators.
