We analyzed hospital records to provide a population￾based estimate of zygomycosis incidence and trends over a 
10-year period at a national level in France. Data showed an 
increasing incidence from 0.7/million in 1997 to 1.2/million 
in 2006 (p<0.001). We compared our data with those from 
the French Mycosis Study Group, a recently established 
voluntary network of French mycologists coordinated by the 
National Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungals. We 
documented that incidence of zygomycosis increased, par￾ticularly in patients with hematologic malignancies or bone 
marrow transplants. The role of previous exposure to anti￾fungal drugs lacking activity against zygomycetes could ex￾plain this increase but does not appear exclusive. Incidence 
also increased in the population of patients with diabetes 
mellitus. We conclude that observed trends reflect a genuine 
increase of zygomycosis cases in at-risk populations.
Zygomycoses are severe angioinvasive infections caused 
by common filamentous fungi, the zygomycetes. These 
ubiquitous opportunistic fungi can cause infections with 
high lethality in immunocompromised or diabetic patients. 
Whatever the route of infection (inhalation of airborne 
spores, ingestion, or direct skin inoculation), the hyphae 
invade blood vessels, causing tissue infarction and necrosis 
(1–4). In healthy persons, innate immunity is sufficient to 
prevent infection, except in cases of massive contamina￾tion after traumatic inoculation of contaminated soil (5). 
Patients with phagocytic dysfunctions caused by neutrope￾nia or ketoacidosis, as well as patients with high iron serum 
concentrations, are at high risk of developing zygomycosis 
(4). These underlying conditions can influence clinical pre￾sentation and outcome (2,6,7). The rhinocerebral presenta￾tion is the most frequently reported localized symptom fol￾lowed by pulmonary, cutaneous, cerebral, gastrointestinal, 
and disseminated infections (3,8). In the rhinocerebral or 
pulmonary forms, patient death rates are reported to be as 
high as 60% because of delayed diagnosis or delayed thera￾peutic management (7–9). Treatment strategies are based 
on high doses of any lipid formulation of amphotericin B, 
associated with large surgical resections when possible. 
Most triazole agents are not effective in vivo (10), except 
for posaconazole, which shows some efficacy both experi￾mentally and in patients as second-line therapy (11–13). 
The clinical contribution of new iron chelating agents re￾mains controversial (14,15).
Some reports have suggested an increasing incidence 
of zygomycosis on the basis of analysis of data from mono￾centric studies (7,10,14,16). Several explanations have 
been posited: longer survival of persons with severe he￾matologic malignancies or solid organ transplantations; 
increased knowledge of the infection and thus a better di￾agnosis yield; and finally, prolonged use of new antifungal 
drugs ineffective against zygomycetes as prophylactic or 
empiric treatment in bone marrow transplant recipients or 
other immunocompromised patients (10,17–20). However, 
the incidence of infection among the general population 
and infection trends over time has rarely been documented 
at a national level. To describe the demographic character￾istics of patients and to estimate the incidence and case￾fatality ratio (CFR) associated with the major underlying 
diseases, we analyzed the electronic hospitalization and 
death records of patients in France in whom zygomycosis 
had been diagnosed.

RESEARCH
Materials and Methods
Data Sources
To describe cases and to estimate incidence, we ex￾tracted all hospital records related to zygomycosis from 
1997 through 2006 in metropolitan France, which includes 
mainland France and the island of Corsica. The French hos￾pital information system, Programme de Médicalisation du 
Système d’Information (PMSI), is a managerial tool based 
on the systematic collection of standardized administrative 
and medical information for any new hospital admission. 
An estimated 95% of all public and private hospitals use 
this tool, including all third-level structures, i.e., university 
hospitals and other reference hospitals (21). An anonymous 
extraction of the dataset with limited sociodemographic 
information (age, sex, and residence area) can be made 
available for specific epidemiologic studies. Medical in￾formation includes the main cause of admission (principal 
diagnosis), the related medical conditions (with >20 entries 
for various associated diagnoses), duration of stay, modes 
of admission and discharge, and major medical activities 
performed during the stay. Diseases are coded according 
to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revi￾sion (ICD-10). This coding system was stable during the 
study period. Conversely, the codes for medical or surgical 
procedures, determined at the national level, have evolved 
over time, with notable changes occurring in 2003.
To estimate the overall CFR, deaths that occurred 
during hospitalization, including those among readmitted 
patients, were identified through the PMSI. To take into 
account deaths that occurred after discharge, we also used 
data from death certificates available at the institution in 
charge of recording and analyzing death certificates, the 
CepiDc. The certificate is completed at the time of death by 
the attending physician (at hospital or home) who records 
the main cause of death (i.e., the direct, immediate cause), 
as well as underlying diseases that may have contributed to 
death. The certificate is then sent to the CepiDc, where it is 
coded according to ICD-10.
Case Identification
We used all PMSI records in which the ICD-10 codes 
B46 or B460 to B469 were identified; these corresponded 
to any clinical presentation of zygomycosis, or mucormy￾cosis. To distinguish first admissions from rehospitaliza￾tions, we created a unique patient identifier by chaining the 
variables year of birth (derived from the patient’s age and 
the date of admission), gender, and residence postal code. 
The same identifier was used to match PMSI and CepiDc 
data, to identify additional deaths and to check for dupli￾cates. However, the CepiDc identifier was based on the 
exact year of birth, but in the PMSI we derived the year of 
birth from age at admission.
Case Definitions
We defined as unique cases those that had an identifier 
detected only 1 time in the PMSI during the 10-year period. 
Cases detected >1 time were classified as new cases at first 
occurrence in the database; subsequent ones were coded as 
readmissions. After checking for duplicates, we analyzed 
unique or new cases for incidence.
The zygomycosis cases were classified according to 
their clinical presentation, when available. When several 
body localizations were reported, we selected the most 
severe one, either in a single stay or in subsequent admis￾sions. For instance, the association of unspecified local￾ization (B46, B468, or B469) or gastrointestinal (B462) 
or cutaneous (B463) localizations, together with a pulmo￾nary (B461), a rhinocerebral (B462), or a disseminated 
(B464) localization, was classified under 1 of the 3 latter 
categories.
We similarly analyzed the underlying diseases poten￾tially associated with zygomycosis and focused on known 
risk factors. We combined the ICD-10 codes with medical 
procedures because some conditions, such as bone marrow 
transplantation, were coded as a procedure and not as a dis￾ease. To take into consideration patients with >1 underly￾ing condition, we introduced a hierarchy. We first created 
the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) category, which 
included autologous and allogenic BMT, with or without 
graft versus host disease. To reduce underreporting bias, 
we looked for BMT occurrence in both incident and read￾mitted patients. Because of changes in the coding system 
regarding medical procedures, identification of autologous 
versus allogenic BMTs before 2003 was not possible. In 
a second category labeled hematologic malignancies, we 
included neutropenia or aplastic anemia, acute lymphoid or 
myeloid leukemia, lymphomas, and other disorders of the 
myeloid system. The third category, labeled nonhematolog￾ic immunodepression, included solid organ cancers, HIV 
infection, solid organ transplantations, and/or rejection of 
these transplantations. By convention, BMT patients (with 
or without graft versus host disease) who also had a neu￾tropenia were classified under the BMT category. Finally, 
we analyzed diabetes types 1 or 2 patients under a separate 
category; for patients who had both an immunosuppressive 
condition and diabetes, the immunosuppressive condition 
was kept as the main risk factor.
Data Analysis
Taking into account population growth, we used the 
1999 national population census to estimate annual inci￾dence rates. To enable trends comparisons, we used the 
same approach for the specific incidence rates in patients 
with underlying factors (zygomycosis patients presenting 
these underlying factors in the numerator and total popu￾lation in the denominator). Because of heterogeneous age 
1396 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 9, September 2009

Zygomycosis, France
distributions in the population according to geographic ar￾eas, standardization of incidence rates by gender and age 
groups was performed in each of the 96 districts (depart￾ments) of metropolitan France. Populations in the districts 
ranged from 73,500 to >2.5 million inhabitants.
For CFR, we considered a possible underreporting in 
the PMSI combined with inaccuracies in the registration of 
causes of deaths in the CepiDc. To estimate the number of 
deaths that could have been missed by both data sources, 
we performed a capture–recapture analysis following the 
method synthesized by Gallay et al. (22). In a 2 × 2 table, 
the numbers of deaths identified in one of the respective da￾tabases (n1,2 or n2,1, in which the subscript 1 indicates identi￾fied and 2 indicates not identified) or in both databases (n1,1) 
are entered in the respective 2 × 2 table’s boxes. Under the 
hypothesis that both sources are independent, deaths that 
could have been missed by both sources (n2,2) can be es￾timated by the equation (n2,2 = n1,2 × n2,1 / n1,1). The total 
number of deaths is N = n1,1 + n1,2 + n2,1 + n2,2. The variance 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are Var(N) = (n1,1 + n2,1)
(n1,1 + n1,2)(n1,2)(n2,1)/(n1,1)3
 and 95% CI = N ± 1.96Var(N), 
respectively.
The CFR estimates were impaired by the unavailabil￾ity of accurate information about underlying medical con￾ditions for deaths identified in the CepiDc. In addition, the 
approximation of the year of birth when using the PMSI 
dataset limited the CFR studies by age groups. We there￾fore restricted the analysis to the overall CFR by under￾lying diseases whenever possible and made no further as￾sumptions on missing data.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by using Excel (Mi￾crosoft Corporation, Redmond,, WA, USA) and STATA-9 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) software. The 
Fisher exact or χ2
 tests were used where appropriate to 
compare groups. Trends were assessed by using a Poisson 
regression. Where appropriate, we present results with 95% 
CIs and p values, considering p<0.05 as significant.
Results
Increased Incidence of Zygomycosis in Metropolitan 
France
Of 828 hospital stays linked to zygomycosis, 531 inci￾dent cases were identified in public and private hospitals of 
metropolitan France from 1997 through 2006 There were 
283 males and 248 females (sex ratio 1.1); mean age was 
57.1 years (median 60 years, range: <1 month–96 years). 
The annual incidence rate (AIR) increased from 0.7 cas￾es/million persons in 1997 to 1.2/million persons in 2006 
(Figure 1); yearly increase was +7.4% (p<0.001). Averaged 
over the 10 years of study, the AIR was 0.9/million persons 
(95% CI 0.8–1.0). This average AIR increased with age 
from 0.3/million in children aged 0–9 years to 3.9/million 
in patients >89 years of age (Figure 2).
The number of patients per district of residence varied 
from 0 to 36 over the 10-year period. The average standard￾ized incidence rate varied from 0 to 3.4/million persons per 
district per year. The highest rates were observed in 5 rural 
districts hosting <500,000 inhabitants each (p<0.01): from 
2.4/million (95% CI 2.3–2.5) to 3.4/million (95% CI 3.2–
3.5) versus 0.9/million nationwide. In the greater Paris area 
hosting ≈10 million inhabitants in 8 districts, the average 
standardized incidence rate was 1.1/million per year (95% 
CI 0.9–1.2), not significantly different from the rate for the 
nation.
Underlying diseases among the 531 zygomycosis case￾patients comprised 156 patients with immunosuppressive 
conditions: 33 patients with BMT, 59 patients with hema￾tologic malignancies, and 64 patients with nonhematologic 
immunodepression (Table). Of the 104 patients with dia￾betes, 17 also experienced an underlying immunosuppres￾sive condition and were classified as such. In zygomycosis 
patients with hematologic malignancies, the specific AIR 
increased over time from 0.02 to 0.2 cases/million persons 
from 1997 through 2006 (+24%/year; p<0.001) (Figure 
1). It also increased in patients with BMT (+15%/year; p 
= 0.02) or with diabetes (+9%/year; p = 0.02). Incidence 
was not significantly altered over time for patients with 
nonhematologic immunodepression and in patients with no 
known risk factors (data not shown).
Clinical Presentation
The reported presentations included pulmonary 
(18.5%), rhinocerebral (11.8%), cutaneous (9.4%), and 
disseminated (6.8%) localizations. The digestive tract was 
mentioned as a unique localization for 123 (23.2%) pa￾tients. No information was available for 30.3% of patients.

Deaths
Sixty-one deaths were recorded in the PMSI dataset, 
including 7 deaths reported among readmitted patients. We 
identified 31 additional deaths in the CepiDc, resulting in 
a total of 92 deaths during the study period and an over￾all CFR of 17.3% (95% CI 9.1–31.5). Lethality evolved 
over time and increased from 2004 onward: average CFR 
was 13.7% in the 1997–2003 period versus 23.6% in the 
2004–2006 period (p<0.01). Using the capture–recapture 
method, the overall expected number of deaths would reach 
143 (95% CI 0–40) for a CFR of 26.9% (95% CI 0–100%). 
The specific CFR according to underlying conditions was 
calculated only for the 61 deaths reported in the PMSI for 
which information was available (Table). It was greater 
when patients had hematologic malignancies (47.8%) or 
BMT (36.4%). In patients with nonhematologic immu￾nodepression, diabetes, or no known risk factors, the CFRs 
were 12.5%, 9.3%, and 4.2%, respectively.
Discussion
Incidence and Trends
This retrospective analysis of hospital records provides 
a population-based estimate of zygomycosis incidence and 
trends over a 10-year period at a national level. It shows an 
increasing incidence from 0.7/million to 1.2/million popu￾lation (p<0.001). The average 0.9/million annual incidence 
rate in France is lower than the 1.7/million incidence re￾ported in the population-based study by Rees et al. in Cali￾fornia in 1992–1993 (23). However, our results are based 
on a passive routine system, whereas an active laboratory￾based surveillance was implemented in the San Francisco 
Bay area at a time of high HIV prevalence; this system had 
smaller sample sizes (2.9 million in San Francisco vs. ≈60 
million in France). In a survey performed in Spain in 2005, 
incidence was 0.43/106
 on a representative sample of 50 
participating hospitals covering one third of the country’s 
population, i.e., ≈14 million inhabitants (24). 
We compared our data with those from the French 
Mycosis Study Group, a recently established voluntary 
network of French mycologists coordinated by the Na￾tional Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungals 
(NRCMA). This network, which covers all university and 
other tertiary level hospitals in France, reported an aver￾age of 17 cases per year since 2003 versus 65 in our study 
for the same period. These differences could have several 
nonexclusive reasons. First, diagnosing zygomycosis is 
not easy. As recently underlined (25), a culture positive 
with a zygomycete does not always mean infection; many 
gastrointestinal cases reported in the PMSI may be false￾positive cases resulting from laboratory contamination. 
The unusual distribution of clinical presentations found in 
our study and the fact that one third of clinical information 
was missing favor this hypothesis. Second, we may have 
overestimated the number of cases because of undetected 
duplicates or coding errors. However, inversely, underre￾porting from the voluntary-based NRCMA network may 
also occur.
The relevance of hospital discharge data based on 
ICD-10 codes to estimate the incidence of a rare disease 
is regularly debated because of limitations in diagnosis 
accuracy, inconsistent disease coding, or undetected du￾plicates because of anonymous data recording (26). As 
reported by Chang et al. (27), who compared administra￾tive data with medical records in the United States, the 
positive predictive value of ICD-10 codes for detecting 
invasive aspergillosis can be low. The authors stressed 
that these codes may sometimes be assigned before final 
diagnosis is confirmed, or they may not be assigned by the 
clinician in charge of the patient. These considerations are 
also true in the PMSI: overreporting was estimated at 11% 
for cancers of the thyroid in a study based in 10 districts 
(28) and at 15% for mesothelioma (29). Inversely, under￾reporting caused by diagnostic or coding errors was esti￾mated at 17% by Hafdi-Nejjari et al. (30) and at 27% by 
Carré et al. (28), respectively. Nevertheless, administra￾tive data are useful tools to estimate the trends of severe 
infections like zygomycosis, since most patients are likely 
to be hospitalized (26,31), especially in the tertiary care 
centers that participate in the PMSI.
We were able to document that the incidence of zy￾gomycosis increased in the population of patients with 
hematologic malignancies or BMT, as already noticed in 
the 1990s (32). In this population, increases in the number 
of recorded cases could be linked to frequent prescription 
of antifungal drugs lacking activity against zygomycetes, 
such as voriconazole and caspofungin (10,17,18,33–35).

Zygomycosis, France
However, the role of previous exposure to these antifun￾gal drugs does not appear exclusive because the incidence 
also increased in the population of patients with diabetes 
mellitus, a population not known to be commonly exposed 
to long-term antifungal therapies. An increasing number of 
the populations at risk (increasing incidence or prolonged 
survival times) could explain the increase observed in our 
study: +24% per year for patients with hematologic malig￾nancies and +15% for BMT patients, respectively. How￾ever, data from the national agency in charge of the sur￾veillance of transplantations (36) indicate that the number 
of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations increased by 
+1.58% per year (p<0.01) 2001–2006. Similarly, we docu￾mented a +9% per year increase in zygomycosis in patients 
with diabetes; in parallel, diabetes prevalence increased at 
an estimated 5.7%/year in France from 2000 through 2005 
(37). We thus tend to consider that the observed trends re￾flect a genuine increase of zygomycosis cases in these at￾risk populations.
Patients’ Characteristics
The PMSI provides scarce information about the so￾ciodemographic characteristics of patients. In a review of 
929 cases published from 1940 through 1999, Roden et 
al. (8) indicated a 1.8 M:F sex ratio and an average age of 
38.8 years, versus 1.1 M:F sex ratio and 57.1 years in our 
study, respectively. However, age distributions and un￾derlying conditions are likely to differ between places and 
to evolve over time, thus not allowing strict comparisons. 
Another limitation of the PMSI is the absence of informa￾tion regarding the circumstances of exposure and portal of 
entry. The highest incidence rates found in 5 rural districts 
and not in others of comparable age and gender distribu￾tions may indicate a particular exposure to molds in rural 
environments (for instance, a professional exposure) or an 
increased awareness of these diseases among clinicians 
and microbiologists/mycologists of the corresponding 
regions.
Patient CFRs
Reporting biases may also partially explain the over￾all low CFR in our study: 26.9% in our highest estimate 
versus 54% in Roden’s review of 929 cases (8). Neverthe￾less, the CFRs for patients with severe immunosuppres￾sive conditions (Table) are close to values reported in the 
literature. The CFRs in our study are population-based, 
while reports from the literature mostly refer to large but 
relatively old series or to series of immunocompromised 
patients with severe underlying diseases whose outcome 
is expected to be worse than in the nonimmunocompro￾mised general population (8,32,38). Also, the CFRs in 
these other studies may include the long-term outcomes 
for more discrete time frames, for example, 1 year surviv￾al rates (32), information not available through our type 
of study. Deaths occurring during hospitalization are not 
systematically reported in the PMSI, and those occurring 
outside the hospital may be underdiagnosed in the CepiDc 
because many practitioners are not aware of zygomycosis. 
False-positive cases (for instance, zygomycetes culture 
without infection) can also influence CFR calculations 
by increasing the denominator. The wide range of CFR 
estimates calculated with the capture–recapture method 
reflects these uncertainties.
Recent progress in early diagnosis and treatment 
strategies over time should also be considered. For in￾stance, the CFR of rhinocerebral forms may vary from 
20% to 69% (16,39). Roden et al. showed a decrease of 
the global CFR from 84% to 47% over time since the 
1950s (8). Antifungal drugs combined with surgical re￾sections play an important role in decreasing lethality for 
localized infections. The CFR reportedly decreased from 
70% in patients treated with antifungal drugs alone down 
to 14% in patients who receive combined antifungal drugs 
and surgical treatment (40).

Given the stable increase of incidence over years 
especially among patients presenting known risk factors

RESEARCH
(Figure 1), we tend to consider that the increasing num￾bers of zygomycosis cases are likely to reflect the actual 
temporal trends of zygomycosis infections diagnosed in 
the French public and private hospitals. Despite the limi￾tations linked to the sources of data we used, this study 
provides a useful overview of the zygomycosis incidence 
trends over a decade at a western European country level. 
It stresses the growing frequency of this severe infection 
and the need to increase awareness among clinicians of 
early diagnosis and treatment, especially for patients with 
hematologic malignancies, BMT, and/or diabetes. As 
stated by Chang et al. (27), administrative data can be re￾garded as useful screening tools that should be completed 
by medical record investigation. In fact, our study has rep￾resented an opportunity to launch in 2008 a retrospective 
study of zygomycosis cases identified through the PMSI 
and the NRCMA. This study will provide a description of 
zygomycosis cases and their outcome in France. In addi￾tion, it should enable us to evaluate the predictive value of 
administrative data for this rare disease.
