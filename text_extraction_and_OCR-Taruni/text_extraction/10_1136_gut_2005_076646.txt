T
he treatment of hepatitis C has dramatically improved over the past decade. Unlike any other
chronic viral infection, a significant proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C can be
cured. However, the current standard therapy—pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin—
has its limitations. Limited efficacy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and the
side effect profile will necessitate the development of new therapeutic approaches. This review
describes the efficacy and optimisation of the current standard therapy of hepatitis C and its
problems in special patient populations. New treatment directions beyond interferon alpha based
therapies are on the horizon.
c MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE HEPATITIS C
Early identification of patients with acute HCV infection is important for their optimal
management. The rate of chronic evolution is 50–90%, and the natural course of chronic hepatitis
C can be associated with severe complications. Patients with chronic hepatitis C have the
potential risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.1 The social burden of
HCV infection is high, including for health care workers. Extrahepatic manifestations of HCV are
often troublesome and may not be reversible with viral eradication.2 These are good reasons for
the design of a prophylactic vaccine but as this has yet to be accomplished, early treatment of
acute HCV infection with interferon alpha (IFN) is the only option to prevent chronicity.
Immediate treatment of patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis C with recombinant IFN or
pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) monotherapy for 24 weeks can prevent the development of chronic
hepatitis C in approximately 90% of cases.3–5 Combination with ribavirin is not necessary.6
However, symptomatic patients also have a good chance to clear HCV spontaneously.7 8 This
usually occurs in the first 12 weeks after the onset of symptoms. A wait and see strategy (that is,
treatment of only those patients who remain HCV-RNA positive 12 weeks after the onset of
symptoms) resulted in an overall sustained virological response (self limited and treatment
induced) in 91% of patients.8 A study coordinated by the German competence network for viral
hepatitis (Hep-Net)9 is underway to test if a wait and see strategy may be as effective as
immediate treatment (www.kompetenznetz-hepatitis.de/study_house/hcv_III_studie.htm).
Asymptomatic patients however should be treated immediately as they have a higher risk for
chronic evolution. Post exposure prophylaxis (for example, short duration IFN administration
after a needlestick injury to prevent HCV infection) is not necessary.10 The future may bring highly
effective antiviral drugs which allow short term treatment for all acutely infected patients.
STANDARD THERAPY OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS C
The importance of an effective treatment against hepatitis C is reflected by the 170 million people
that are chronically infected with HCV. Despite implementation of blood donor screening in the
early 1990s, an increase in HCV related cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular
carcinoma over the next 10–20 years is still anticipated.11
Before identification of HCV as the infectious agent for non-A, non-B hepatitis,12 it was found
that IFN may lead to normalisation of transaminases and improvement in liver histology.13 After
identification of HCV, it became possible to measure the success of therapy as long lasting
disappearance of HCV-RNA from serum, a so-called sustained virological response (SVR). Since
that time, the SVR rate has increased from 5% to 20% with IFN monotherapy and from 40% to
50% with the combination of IFN and ribavirin (fig 1). 14–17 The development of PEG-IFN was a
further milestone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.18 Two PEG-IFNs are available: PEG-IFN
alpha-2b (PEG-Intron; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA) and PEG-IFN alpha-2a
(PEGASYS; Roche). Pegylation of IFN allows once weekly administration due to an improved
pharmacokinetic profile. PEG-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy improved the overall SVR to
54–63% (fig 1).16 19 20 There seems to be no difference between both PEG-IFNs in combination
with ribavirin in terms of SVR.21 However, both PEG-IFNs have different pharmacokinetic profiles
due to their different polyethylene glycol moieties. PEG-IFN alpha-2b is bound to a single linear

12 kDa polyethylene glycol molecule whereas PEG-IFN
alpha-2a is covalently attached to a 40 kDa branched chain
polyethylene glycol moiety. The distinct sizes of the PEG-IFNs
influence the volume of distribution. PEG-IFN alpha-2b is
given adjusted for body weight (1.5 mg/kg once weekly) while
the larger PEG-IFN alpha-2a is given in a fixed dose of 180 mg
once weekly (reviewed by Cornberg and colleagues18 and
Pedder22) (table 1).
Ribavirin should be administered according to the body
weight of the patient. A retrospective analysis of a large PEG￾IFN alpha-2b/ribavirin pivotal trial revealed that the optimal
ribavirin dose is at least 10.6 mg/kg (table 2).16 Therefore,
ribavirin (Rebetol; Schering-Plough) is recommended at a
concentration of approximately 11 mg/kg body weight in
combination with PEG-IFN alpha-2b (table 1). When
combined with PEG-IFN alpha-2a, a ribavirin (Copegus;
Roche, Basel, Switzerland) dose of 1000 mg if ,75 kg or
1200 mg if >75 kg is recommended for HCV genotype 1
patients, while 800 mg ribavirin are suggested for patients
with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 (tables 1, 2). The benefit of
higher ribavirin doses has not been observed for genotype 2/3
patients in combination with PEG-IFN alpha-2a.20 The
Hadziyannis study20 also confirmed the 24 week schedule
for HCV genotype 2/3 patients whereas patients with HCV
genotype 1 require 48 weeks of therapy (table 2). The
24 week regimen for patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3
has also been confirmed for the combination of PEG-IFN
alpha-2b and ribavirin (table 2).23 24
Early HCV-RNA kinetics predict the outcome and success
of treatment. Patients with HCV genotype 1, who do not
show a HCV-RNA decline of more than 2 log10 or have serum
concentrations of more than 30 000 IU/ml HCV-RNA after
12 weeks of therapy (TW12), have no chance of achieving an
SVR.25 26 Thus therapy should be discontinued in these
patients.
The main challenge for the future is to improve the success
rates for the difficult to treat and non-responsive HCV
genotype 1 patients. While patients with HCV genotypes 2
and 3 can be cured in more than 75% of cases, the 40–50%
SVR for patients with HCV genotype 1 is still unsatisfactory.
INDIVIDUALISATION AND OPTIMISATION OF THE
CURRENT STANDARD THERAPY
Adherence to therapy
Adherence to therapy is one of the most important factors
associated with the success of therapy.17 The definition of
adherence used here is the 80/80/80 rule, as patients who
received more than 80% of IFN, more than 80% of ribavirin,
and were treated for more than 80% of the planned duration
of treatment are considered adherent. One of the first studies
investigating the effect of adherence demonstrated that
patients who fulfilled the 80/80/80 rule had a 63% sustained
response compared with 52% of those with less than 80%
adherence.17 This was statistically significant for HCV
genotype 1 patients. Therefore, it is important to reduce side
effects and motivate patients to adhere to treatment in order
to optimise treatment responses, especially in difficult to treat
genotype 1 patients.
Optimal treatment duration
Optimal treatment duration may also improve the manage￾ment of chronic hepatitis C. There are two different concepts
to optimise treatment duration. While some patients with
HCV genotype 1 may need longer treatment to improve the
response, patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 may be
treated for a shorter period of time to reduce costs and side
effects.
Many studies are investigating reductions in treatment
duration for HCV genotypes 2 and 3 to 16, 14, or even
12 weeks. The first reported results are very promising but we
have to consider individual factors when treating patients for
less than 24 weeks. The early virological response (EVR) after
four weeks of therapy (HCV-RNA negative in serum at TW4)
is one of the critical factors associated with the success of
shorter therapy. Only patients who showed an EVR at week 4
had high SVR rates after 16 weeks27 (table 2), 14 weeks,28 or
even after 12 weeks of therapy,29 whereas those without an
EVR had low response rates, even with the 24 week schedule.
However, 12 weeks seems to be the limit for some patients as
relapse rates after 12 weeks were higher compared with the
standard 24 week schedule.29 In addition to EVR, other
factors are associated with response in patients with HCV
genotypes 2 and 3. These are HCV genotype and baseline viral
load. Patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 should be
analysed separately because those with HCV genotype 2
respond better to PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy than those
infected with HCV genotype 3 (table 2).24 29 Furthermore, the
shorter treatment schedules revealed that HCV genotype 3
patients with low baseline viraemia (HCV-RNA ,600 000–
800 000 IU/ml) had a much better chance of responding than
those with a high viral load (HCV-RNA .600 000–
800 000 IU/ml).27 28 In conclusion, patients with HCV geno￾type 2 and those with HCV genotype 3 and low viral load who
have an EVR after four weeks of therapy may be treated for
less than 24 weeks, and patients without an EVR (especially
HCV genotype 3 and high viral load) may be treated for more
than 24 weeks (fig 2). The promising results obtained in
these pilot studies need to be confirmed in large multicentre
studies for both PEG-IFNs. Tailoring treatment individually
for patients with HCV genotype 2 and 3 will reduce costs, side
effects, and further optimise response rates.
We face the opposite problem in patients with HCV
genotype 1. Extending treatment duration beyond 48 weeks
is one strategy that may improve response rates in some of
these difficult to treat patients. The rationale is to extend the

time of HCV-RNA negativity, especially in patients with a
slow viral decline (first time HCV-RNA negative between
TW12 and TW24) to reduce relapse rates in these so called
‘‘late responders’’ (fig 2). Several studies investigated the
efficacy and safety of 48 weeks versus 72 weeks of treatment
with PEG-IFN plus ribavirin in patients with chronic
hepatitis C. Sanchez-Tapias et al reported the benefit of
extended therapy in patients who were HCV-RNA positive at
treatment week 4. Relapse rate after 72 weeks of therapy was
significantly reduced in these patients.30 However, treatment
duration beyond one year may lead to higher dropout rates
which results in lower intent to treat responses.30 31
Multivariate analyses of these studies will hopefully reveal
factors such as viral kinetics that will help to identify patients
who will benefit from extended therapy. In conclusion,
extension of therapy to 72 weeks may improve response rates
for patients with a slow viral response (.2 log10 decline but
.50 IU/ml at TW12 (fig 2)) but high motivation and
compliance of the patient is mandatory.
On the other hand, it is possible to reduce treatment
duration to 24 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 1 who
have a low viral load at baseline and an EVR after four weeks
of therapy (table 2, fig 2).32
Amantadine
Another strategy to enhance the success of therapy in
patients with HCV genotype 1 may be the additional use of
amantadine. In 1997, JP Smith reported that amantadine
treatment could improve both biochemical and virological
markers in patients with hepatitis C who had previously not
responded to treatment with IFN.33 The effect of amantadine
monotherapy could not be confirmed in other studies.
However, these data led to numerous studies analysing the
efficacy of amantadine in combination with IFN or IFN/

ribavirin. Brillanti et al were among the first who demon￾strated promising SVR with the triple therapy (IFN/ribavirin/
amantadine) in prior IFN non-responders.34 The dilemma of
all of these small studies was that the results varied from
study to study. While some studies confirmed the results,
others demonstrated no additional benefit of amantadine in
combination with IFN or IFN/ribavirin. A large German
placebo controlled multicentre study treated 400 naı¨ve
patients with IFN/ribavirin/placebo or with IFN/ribavirin/
amantadine. Triple therapy increased SVR by 8% in HCV
genotype 1 patients but this was not statistically significant.35
A placebo controlled study with more than 700 patients in
cooperation with Hep-Net, testing the addition of amanta￾dine to PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy in treatment naı¨ve patients
will hopefully provide the final answer. Perhaps addition of
amantadine can reduce IFN side effects such as fatigue and
depression36 and thus help patients to adhere to treatment.
Amantadine is inexpensive. However, amantadine may cause
QT prolongation in the electrocardiogram and thus is
contraindicated in patients with prolonged QT times.
Other interferons
There are other type 1 interferons in development. Albuferon￾alpha (Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, Maryland, USA),
which is an 85.7 kDa protein consisting of interferon
alpha-2b genetically fused to human serum albumin, further
extends the half life of the IFN to approximately 148 hours
(table 3). The pharmacokinetic profile of albuferon allows
dosing at intervals of 2–4 weeks compared with one week
with PEG-IFNs. Results of a phase II trial testing multiple
doses of albuferon in HCV genotype 1 patients demonstrated
high antiviral efficacy.37 These data led to the initiation of
phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of albuferon in
combination with ribavirin.
Consensus interferon (CIFN) or interferon alphacon-1
(Infergen; Valeant, Costa Mesa, California, USA) is another
type 1 interferon that is already in use for the treatment of
chronic hepatitis C. The ‘‘consensus’’ molecule, composed of
conserved amino acids of type 1 interferons, shows greater
biological activity than other type 1 interferons in vitro.38 39
Despite this in vitro advantage, a head to head study
comparing CIFN and standard IFN monotherapy revealed
only minor differences in efficacy. The results suggested that
patients with HCV genotype 1 may have a small advantage
with CIFN.40 A recent study reported better SVR in naı¨ve
patients with chronic hepatitis C when treated with CIFN in
combination with ribavirin compared with standard IFN plus
ribavirin.41 Some studies investigating the effect of high and
daily dosing of CIFN, in combination with ribavirin in naı¨ve
as well as in non-responders, demonstrated promising
SVR.42 43 However, daily dosing requires high levels of
motivation and compliance as adherence to therapy is an
important factor influencing treatment outcome.
Side effects and complications
Severe side effects may reduce adherence to therapy and may
result in dose modifications which will result in less

response. Both IFN and ribavirin induce side effects that have
to be considered in the management of patients with chronic
hepatitis C (table 4). IFN related side effects can be divided
into IFN induced bone marrow depression, flu-like symp￾toms, neuropsychiatric disorders, and autoimmune syn￾dromes. The main problem with ribavirin is haemolytic
anaemia. Overall, side effects result in 10–20% premature
withdrawals from therapy and an additional 20–30% of
patients require dose modifications. These numbers are lower
in recent than in earlier studies, suggesting improved
understanding and management of adverse events,44 poten￾tially also leading to higher SVR (fig 1). However, these
percentages were recorded from registration trials using
careful selection of patients. This may differ in general
clinical practice where patients with, for example, a history of
depression, low platelets, or thyroid disease are being treated.
IFN side effects
The effect of IFN on bone marrow results in decreased
granulocytes and thrombocytes during treatment. These are
usually moderate if normal counts are present initially.
However, dose modifications are necessary, especially in
patients with initially low counts. This limits the use of IFN
in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis who often have low
platelets and are also more vulnerable to infections.
Neutropenia is one of the most common reasons for dose
modifications. This granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimu￾lating factor could potentially be used to stabilise neutrophil
counts during IFN therapy.45 46 Cost benefit analyses and
further trials are required to recommend routine use of these
agents. However, our own experience and other reports
suggest that IFN induced neutropenia is generally not
associated with an increased risk of bacterial infections.47
Flu-like symptoms usually occur during the first weeks of
treatment and severity declines in the later treatment period.
These side effects include fever, chills, headaches, arthralgia,
and myalgia (table 4). Antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol
can help to prevent or reduce these side effects.
Neuropsychiatric side effects such as irritability, severe
fatigue, and apathy are frequent (table 4) and a great
problem for many patients, which also affect family
members. Severe depression can occur and even suicide has
been reported.48 Psychiatric care and the use of antidepres￾sants, especially serotonin uptake inhibitors, may help to
reduce IFN induced depression49 and consequently improve
adherence to therapy and response rates.50 Prospective
placebo controlled trials are underway to confirm these
preliminary findings.
IFN has immunomodulatory properties, and treatment can
induce autoimmune phenomena.51 The most frequent pro￾blem is the development of autoimmune thyroiditis. In most
cases thyroiditis starts with hyperthyroidism that later
becomes hypothyroidism. Autoimmune thyroiditis has been
reported in up to 20% of patients under or after IFN based
therapies. This may not be reversible after stopping therapy.52
Predisposed patients with pre-existing thyroid antibodies
have a higher risk and it is possible that hepatitis C itself may
be a cause of autoimmune thyroiditis.53
Other autoimmune diseases can also be aggravated by IFN
therapy (for example, diabetes or autoimmune hepatitis).
Patients with documented hepatitis C infection may deterior￾ate during IFN treatment if an underlying autoimmune
hepatitis is present. This has been observed particularly in
LKM antibody positive individuals. These patients require
careful monitoring if IFN is considered as firstline treatment.
However, IFN therapy seems to be safe in most HCV/anti￾LKM-1 positive patients.54 55
Ribavirin side effects
The main side effect of ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia as this
complication may frequently result in ribavirin dose reduc￾tion or even discontinuation, which may significantly affect
the overall SVR, especially in patients with HCV genotype 1.16
Treatment with erythropoietin can effectively reverse
ribavirin associated anaemia and allow full adherence to
ribavirin therapy.56 This will improve response rates but the
treatment is expensive and not reimbursed in many
countries. This problem emphasises the need for alternative
ribavirin-like drugs with less toxicity and/or higher antiviral
efficacy. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which ribavirin
enhances the efficacy of IFN treatment and prevents relapse
remains largely unknown. Proposed mechanisms are immun￾modulatory effects, inhibition of inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity, and induction of RNA
mutagenesis.57 58 More potent IMPDH inhibitors such as
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, Cell Cept; Roche) or VX-497
have been studied59 but with limited effects.60 Another
approach is the development of a ribavirin prodrug.
Viramidine is the amidine version of ribavirin and is
converted by the enzyme adenosine deaminase to ribavirin,
mainly in hepatocytes (table 3). Therefore, there is less
uptake of ribavirin into red blood cells after administration of
viramidine and consequently less haemolytic anaemia.61 First
results of a phase II study demonstrated that viramidine in
combination with PEG-IFN alpha-2a led to significantly less
anaemia compared with ribavirin plus PEG-IFN.62 Phase III
studies with both PEG-IFNs in combination with viramidine
have been carried out (VISER 1 and 2). Preliminary data
(VISER 1) confirmed the superior safety profile of viramidine
plus PEG-IFN alpha-2b but viramidine did not meet the

The incidence of side effects between different studies is difficult to

differences in assessing the side effects. Patients were selected on the
basis of well defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Normal thyroid
stimulating hormone levels pretreatment were a prerequisite.

non-inferiority to ribavirin efficacy endpoint on an intent-to￾treat basis (SVR: 38% v 52%).[63a] Further subanalyses, the
VISER 2 trial, and possibly weight based dosing of
viramidine, may be awaited to draw final conclusions.
Meanwhile, drug monitoring of ribavirin could be an
option to optimise the ribavirin dose without losing efficacy.64
The pharmacokinetic properties of ribavirin suggest that not
only body weight but also renal function (glomerular
filtration rate) should be considered when selecting the
ribavirin dose.65
TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C IN SPECIAL
POPULATIONS
Patients with normal aminotransferase levels
Approximately 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C
maintain persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
levels despite having detectable HCV-RNA in serum.
Treatment indications for these patients are questionable.
Firstly, these patients have generally mild liver disease and
show a slow progression to cirrhosis. Secondly, treatment
with IFN has been shown to be associated with ALT flares in
the past (reviewed by Tassopoulos66). Thirdly, the efficacy of
therapy may be lower as patients with elevated transami￾nases seem to respond better.67 However, up to one third of
patients with normal ALT can present with significant liver
fibrosis which necessitates an effective treatment.68 69 Zeuzem
et al demonstrated that 48 weeks of PEG-IFN alpha-2a and
ribavirin combination led to SVR rates of 52% in patients
with chronic hepatitis C and persistently normal ALT levels.
Treatment related flares in ALT activity were not observed.68
The efficacy and tolerability of PEG-IFN/ribavirin combina￾tion therapy in patients with persistently normal ALT levels
seem to be comparable with patients with elevated ALT
levels. The decision to treat or not to treat patients with
chronic hepatitis C and persistently normal ALT levels should
be made on an individual basis, independent of ALT levels.
HIV/HCV coinfection
A significant portion of individuals infected with the human
immune deficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with HCV.70
The first European Consensus Conference on the treatment of
chronic hepatitis B and C in HIV coinfected patients was held
in February 2005.71 HCV induced liver disease is now a major
cause of morbidity for these patients following the introduc￾tion of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Hepatitis C liver disease may progress much more rapidly in
HIV infected patients than in immunocompetent patients.
Effective anti-HCV treatment is therefore needed for HIV
patients. The first studies using conventional IFN plus
ribavirin showed disappointing SVR (fig 3). Side effects
leading to frequent early discontinuation may have con￾tributed to these results.70 72 73 In addition, ribavirin induced
haemolysis is a particular problem for HIV patients and thus
the ribavirin dose was often not adequate in these studies.
Another problem of ribavirin is exacerbation of mitochon￾drial toxicity caused by anti-HIV drugs, such as didanosine.74
This may explain the reported cases of pancreatitis in patients
treated with didanosine containing antiretroviral regimens in
some studies (reviewed by Manns and Wedemeyer75).
Didanosine treatment was also associated with an increased
risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis who
were treated with PEG-IFN and ribavirin.76 However, the
overall risk for hepatic decompensation in HIV/HCV coin￾fected patients without cirrhosis was rather low. Therefore,
patients with cirrhosis need careful monitoring and didano￾sine should be avoided. With added experience and the
development of PEG-IFN, SVR increased to more than 40%
(fig 3) and early discontinuation due to adverse events
declined to 12–17%.77–80 The efficacy of PEG-IFN and ribavirin
in HCV/HIV coinfected patients is comparable with HCV
mono infected patients if the adequate ribavirin dose is used.
In particular, for these patients, approaches to improve the
adherence to therapy would further improve the success of
treatment in coinfected patients. A dilemma of antiviral
therapy with IFN is that GBV-C (hepatitis G) may also be
cleared. However, GBV-C coinfection is associated with an
improved natural course of HIV infection,81–83 even with
HAART. A recent study showed that patients who lost GBV-C
had the poorest prognosis.84 GBV-C status should be
considered and careful follow up monitoring after anti-HCV
therapy may reveal the impact of HCV/HIV/GBV-C coinfec￾tions.
HCV and liver transplantation
HCV reinfection occurs in almost all patients after liver
transplantation. While the course of hepatitis C in liver
transplant recipients was believed to be rather benign in the
late 1980s and early 1990s,85 HCV has led to a more rapid
course post transplant in recent years86 with progression to
cirrhosis within the first 5–10 years in 20–30% of patients.
Thus HCV takes a more rapid course post-transplant than in
immunocompetent individuals, and treatment needs are
obvious.
Antiviral therapy for HCV may be administered before
transplantation to prevent reinfection of the graft. If this
approach is successful, reinfection can be prevented in two
thirds of patients.87 However, treatment with IFN and
ribavirin is only poorly tolerated in decompensated cirrhosis
and thus this approach will be feasible in only a minority of
patients.88 Pre-emptive treatment within the first 4–6 weeks
post transplantation has been disappointing, with SVR

between 0% and 33% for different regimens, including IFN
monotherapy and IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy.89 90
There is more experience on the treatment of established
recurrent hepatitis C. The most recent studies using PEG-IFN
in combination with ribavirin showed an initial virological
response rate of up to 55%.91 Treatment duration should be at
least similar to non-transplanted patients considering early
viral kinetics and HCV genotype. However, bone marrow
toxicity, depression, and rejection are limiting factors that
require aggressive management (for example, growth fac￾tors).92 93 The ribavirin dose may have to be adjusted as
several patients have some degree of renal insufficiency.
Interestingly, the risk for IFN induced graft rejection seems to
be higher if ribavirin is not used.
Overall, several issues in the sometimes rather complicated
management of post transplant hepatitis C have yet to be
resolved. Patients with established graft hepatitis should be
treated with PEG-IFN and ribavirin. Whether reinfection can
be prevented in future either by the new direct antivirals
inhibiting HCV replication or by a combination with anti￾HCV antibodies with neutralising properties will have to be
addressed in studies performed in the near future.
Dialysis patients
Treatment needs for dialysis patients with hepatitis C are
obvious, especially if patients are considered for kidney
transplantation. The outcome of HCV post kidney transplan￾tation is worse than for HCV negative patients after renal
transplantation. However, IFN based therapies are contra￾indicated post transplantation as they may induce rejection.
Thus, if possible, HCV should be eliminated before trans￾plantation. There have been several smaller reports on the
treatment of HCV with IFN monotherapy in patients with
end stage renal disease.94 Surprisingly, the results for IFN
monotherapy under dialysis were better than in patients not
undergoing dialysis, with SVR of 21–64%. Data on combina￾tion therapies with ribavirin are limited as ribavirin has
traditionally been considered to be contraindicated in this
setting. However, ribavirin can be given at lower doses in
dialysis patients, usually between 200 and 400 mg daily.95
Several trials on the use of PEG-IFNs plus ribavirin in dialysis
patients are ongoing and final data are not available yet.
However, it has to be considered that there might be
significant differences between the two pegylated interferons
in the setting of dialysis as PEG-IFN alpha-2a is eliminated
mainly by the liver while PEG-IFN alpha-2b is cleared via the
kidney.18 Future studies need to evaluate the potential of
viramidine in particular for this special patient population.
TREATMENT OF THE FUTURE AND DRUGS IN THE
PIPELINE
Future aims should be to develop a treatment beyond IFN
with less side effects and higher efficacy. Knowledge of the
molecular structure of the hepatitis C proteins has allowed
the design of new drugs that directly target the sites of HCV
encoded enzymes that are important for the replication of the
virus. The HCV protease and HCV polymerase are the main
targets for these enzyme inhibitors (tables 3, 5). The first
drug that has been tested in patients and demonstrated the
proof of concept in humans for a HCV protease inhibitor was
BILN-2061 (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Biberach, Germany).
BILN-2061 given twice daily as monotherapy for two days
reduced HCV-RNA by 2–3 log10 in most patients infected
with HCV genotype 1.96 Unfortunately, further clinical trials
are on hold due to preclinical cardiac toxicity issues. Other
promising HCV protease inhibitors97–99 and HCV polymerase
inhibitors100 101 are under investigation (table 5). Drug
resistance may become a problem with these new com￾pounds102 and combination therapies may be unavoidable.
Phase II trials investigating these new drugs in combination
with PEG-IFN are ongoing. The majority of these new
compounds were developed using an in vitro replicon
system103 which was derived from patients with HCV
genotype 1. This probably explains why BILN-2061, for
example, was less effective in patients with HCV genotypes 2
and 3.104 Thus other in vitro replicon systems derived from
patients with non-genotype 1 disease need to be developed.
Recently, a new in vitro culture generated HCV clone derived
from a patient infected with HCV genotype 2a was
established and for the first time this was shown to be
infectious in a chimpanzee.105 The HCV polymerase inhibitor
valopicitabine (NM-283; Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA) was developed using a bovine diarrhoea

Large phase II trials in combination with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) with or without ribavirin have started. The
combination of PEG-IFN may be necessary to prevent drug resistance. More HCV enzyme inhibitors are in
development (for example, GS-9132, Gilead, Achillion; ITMN-191, Intermune; JTK-002/3, Japan Tobacco; HCV￾796, ViroPharma, Wyeth; BILB-1941, Boehringer Ingelheim).

virus in vitro model. Therefore, this drug may by HCV
genotype independent.
Another approach to treatment of HCV infection is
induction of HCV specific immune responses (table 3).
Spontaneous recovery after acute HCV infection is associated
with a strong and broad immune response while develop￾ment of chronic hepatitis C is associated with an impaired
immune response.106 107 The aim of therapeutic vaccination is
to stimulate the hepatitis C specific immune responses to
control viral replication. The first therapeutic vaccines are
currently being tested in phase I/II studies.108 109
Other advances include the development of small mole￾cules such as ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides, and
small interfering RNAs that have been designed to control
viral gene expression. There are many more approaches to
fight hepatitis C and its complications. Tables 3 and 5 give an
overview of the drugs in the pipeline.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 1339
At colour Doppler bowel ultrasound (US), intense vascular
signals with low resistance (fig 1D) suggesting the presence
of intestinal varices were found within and around the wall
of the ascending colon and hepatic flexure (fig 1A–C). Other
relevant US findings included slight bowel wall thickening of
ileal loops in the left flank and dilated (3 cm in diameter)
proximal ileal loops containing stagnating fluid in the left
upper quadrant of the abdomen. Upper endoscopy was
unremarkable. Colonoscopy revealed large varices in the
ascending colon and at the hepatic flexure of the colon (fig 2).
A four channel multidetector spiral computed tomography
(CT) enteroclysis demonstrated narrowing of the jejunal
segment with significant proximal dilatation and, moreover,
a voluminous varicose complex extending from the caecum
towards the ascending colon and surrounding the hepatic
flexure where it was mostly represented (fig 3). CT revealed
collateral circulation in the mesentery suggesting chronic
mesenteric venous thrombosis. Despite meticulous examina￾tion of the CT images, no thrombosis was found.
These observations, together with the clinical history,
suggested the presence of recurrent bleeding from colonic
varices. Likewise, the subocclusive symptoms appeared to be
due to extensive and significant adhesions or, less likely, to a
recurrent bowel stricture. Colonic varices, secondary to
adhesions, in the absence of portal hypertension were found
at laparotomy.
Postoperative adhesions have already been recognised as a
possible cause of colonic varices and gastrointestinal bleed￾ing.1 These complications may result from chronic mesenteric
venous thrombosis that often remains asymptomatic on
account of extensive collateral venous drainage.

ascending region. Figure 3 Reconstructed oblique-coronal image from a contrast
enhanced computed tomography (CT) enteroclysis showing a
voluminous varicose complex extending from the caecum towards the
ascending colon and surrounding hepatic flexure. CT also showed the
presence of thickened bowel walls of several loops situated in the left
flank, thus confirming the ultrasound findings.
