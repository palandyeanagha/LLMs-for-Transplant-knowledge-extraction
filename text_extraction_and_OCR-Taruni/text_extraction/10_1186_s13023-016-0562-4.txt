Abstract
Background: Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked recessive disease characterized by cardiomyopathy,
neutropenia, skeletal myopathy and growth delay. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may improve the
prognosis of this disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of targeted next-generation
sequencing (NGS) in the early diagnosis of BTHS in children with cardiomyopathy.
Methods: During the period between 2012 and 2015, a gene panel-based NGS approach was used to search for
potentially disease-causing genetic variants in all patients referred to our institution with a clinical diagnosis of
primary cardiomyopathy. NGS was performed using the Illumina sequencing system.
Results: A total of 180 Chinese pediatric patients (114 males and 66 females) diagnosed with primary cardiomyopathy
were enrolled in this study. TAZ mutations were identified in four of the male index patients, including two novel
mutations (c.527A > G, p.H176R and c.134_136delinsCC, p.H45PfsX38). All four probands and two additional affected
male family members were born at full term with a median birth weight of 2350 g (range, 2000–2850 g). The median
age at diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was 3.0 months (range, 1.0–20.0 months). The baseline echocardiography revealed
prominent dilation and trabeculations of the left ventricle with impaired systolic function in the six patients, four of
which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of left ventricular noncompaction. Other aspects of their clinical presentations
included hypotonia (6/6), growth delay (6/6), neutropenia (3/6) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (4/5). Five patients
died at a median age of 7.5 months (range, 7.0–12.0 months). The cause of death was heart failure associated with
infection in three patients and cardiac arrhythmia in two patients. The remaining one patient survived beyond infancy
but had fallen into a persistent vegetative state after suffering from cardiac arrest.
Conclusions: This is the first report of systematic mutation screening of TAZ in a large cohort of pediatric patients with
primary cardiomyopathy using the NGS approach. TAZ mutations were found in 4/114 (3.5%) male patients with
primary cardiomyopathy. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of TAZ gene testing in cardiomyopathy genetic
testing panels may contribute to the early diagnosis of BTHS.

Background
Barth syndrome (BTHS; MIM 302060), first described in
1983, is a rare X-linked recessive disease caused by mu￾tations in the TAZ gene located at Xq28 [1, 2]. It typic￾ally presents in males with cardiomyopathy, neutropenia,
skeletal myopathy, growth delay and 3-methylglutaconic
aciduria [3, 4]. Cardiomyopathy within the first year of
life is the most common presentation and the primary
cause of death in affected patients. However, in the ab￾sence of extracardiac features associated with BTHS
(such as skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, growth retard￾ation and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria), it may be
difficult to distinguish BTHS from other infantile cardio￾myopathies based on clinical presentations alone. There￾fore, it seems likely that some patients with BTHS will
remain undiagnosed unless mutation identification is
obtained.
Genetic testing is now increasingly used as a means to
confirm the specific diagnosis for patients with cardio￾myopathy. However, genetic heterogeneity and pheno￾typic variability of the disease limit our ability to
efficiently identify the underlying genetic cause using a
candidate gene approach. Targeted next-generation se￾quencing (NGS) is a cost-effective approach for rapid
and accurate detection of genetic mutations. Man et al.
[5] recently employed NGS in two male siblings with
isolated infantile dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and
identified a hemizygous variant in the TAZ gene, sug￾gesting that NGS may be used as a possible diagnostic
strategy in BTHS. In the present study, we used a gene
panel-based NGS approach to search for potentially
disease-causing genetic variants in a large cohort of
pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy of uncertain
etiology. This led to the identification of TAZ muta￾tions in 4/114 (3.5%) of the male index patients, in￾cluding two novel mutations (c.527A > G, p.H176R and
c.134_136delinsCC, p.H45PfsX38).
Methods
Patients and clinical evaluation
During the period between 2012 and 2015, all patients
referred to our institution with a clinical diagnosis of
primary cardiomyopathy were included in the study. All
patients were evaluated by clinical history, physical
examination, hematologic and biochemical laboratory
analyses, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiog￾raphy. Biochemical analysis of urine organic acids was
investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
according to standard methods.
In this study, neutropenia was defined by an absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) below 1.5 × 109
/L. The cor￾rected QT interval (QTc) was calculated from the 12-
lead ECG using Bazett’s formula and a QTc of more than
440 milliseconds was considered as being prolonged.
Echocardiography (2D, M- mode, and color Doppler)
was used to evaluate the cardiac structure and function.
DCM was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) <45% and left ventricular end-diastolic dimen￾sion (LVEDD) >2 standard deviations above the normal
mean standardized to body surface area; hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) was defined as left ventricular
posterior and/or septal wall thickness >2 standard devia￾tions above the normal mean for body surface area in
the absence of an identifiable hemodynamic cause [6].
The diagnosis of isolated left ventricular noncompaction
(LVNC) was made by echocardiography on the basis
of the criteria established by Jenni et al. [7], includ￾ing: (1) a ratio of non-compacted to compacted layers
of >2 measured in end-systole, (2) numerous promin￾ent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses
filled with blood from the ventricular cavity as dem￾onstrated by color Doppler, and (3) absence of associ￾ated cardiac abnormalities.
Targeted panel-based next-generation sequencing
Peripheral blood was collected and genomic DNA
was extracted according to standard procedures.
Oligonucleotide-based target capture (Agilent SureSelect
Target Enrichment System; Agilent, Santa Clara,
California, United States) and subsequently NGS (Illumina
HiSeq2500) were used to identify potential variants of 62
genes implicated in the causation of cardiomyopathy as
described previously [8]. Alignment of sequence reads to
reference human genome (Human 37.3, SNP135) was per￾formed using the NextGENe® software (SoftGenetics,
Stage College, Pennsylvania, USA). All single nucleotide
variants and indels were saved as VCF format files, and
uploaded to Ingenuity® Variant Analysis™ (Ingenuity
Systems, Redwood City, California, USA) for variations fil￾tering and interpretation. All the variations were classified
according to the recommended method of the American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Pathogenic
and potentially pathogenic mutations were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing, where possible, validated by parental
testing and segregation analysis. NM_000116.3 was used
as the reference sequence for the coding regions of the
TAZ gene. There was an approximate 4–6 week-period
from laboratory receipt to report generation.
Bioinformatic analysis of novel missense mutation
Phylogenetic conservation of the validated missense mu￾tation was analyzed by the ClustalX program.
In silico predictions of the potential pathogenicity of
a missense mutation was conducted by the following
bioinformatics programs: MutationTaster (http://
www.mutationtaster.org), Sorting Intolerant from
Tolerant (SIFT) (http://sift.jcvi.org/), and PolyPhen-2
(http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/).

Treatment and follow-up
All patients with a diagnosis of BTHS received standard
heart failure medications and aspirin therapy, but no in￾dividual received granulocyte colony stimulating factor
injections to prevent infection. All patients were
followed up by either telephone interview or outpatient
clinic visit. The primary outcome was death from any
cause. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular event
or severe infection that required medical supervision or
hospitalization.
Results
Patients and molecular genetics
A total of 180 Chinese pediatric patients (114 males; 66
females) diagnosed with primary cardiomyopathy were
enrolled in this study. Among the index cases, there
were 64 patients (39 males and 25 females) with HCM,
72 patients (44 males and 28 females) with DCM, 27 pa￾tients (17 males and ten females) with LVNC and 17 pa￾tients (14 males and three females) with other types of
cardiomyopathy. We performed targeted NGS on all
these patients and identified TAZ mutations in four of
114 male patients, including three of the 17 male pa￾tients with LVNC and one of the 44 male patients with
DCM. In contrast, no TAZ mutation was detected in the
66 female patients. The results were further validated by
Sanger sequencing in probands and family members.
The genetic features pertinent to the four probands and
their family members are described below.
A novel hemizygous missense variant c.527A > G
(p.H176R) was identified in exon 6 of the TAZ gene in
proband 1(BTHS1 in Table 1; II: four in Family 1 in
Fig. 2). This variant was also identified in his affected
twin brother (BTHS2 in Table 1; II: three in Family 1 in
Fig. 2). Their unaffected mother was heterozygous for
the same mutation, consistent with the X-linked reces￾sive inheritance pattern (Fig. 1).
A hemizygous variant c.367C > T (p.R123X) was de￾tected in exon 4 of the TAZ gene in proband 2 (BTHS3
in Table 1; IV: one in Family 2 in Fig. 2), and a hemizy￾gous frameshift variant c.710_711delTG (p.V237AfsX73)
was identified in exon 10 of TAZ gene in proband 3
(BTHS4 in Table 1; III: five in Family 3 in Fig. 2). Both
of the two mothers were obligate heterozygous carriers.
These two variants have been previously reported to
cause BTHS, indicating that the two variants were
pathogenic [9].
A novel hemizygous frameshift variant c.134_136delinsCC
(p.H45PfsX38) was detected in exon 2 of the TAZ
gene in proband 4 (BTHS5 in Table 1; IV: five in

Family 4 in Fig. 2). Sanger sequencing demonstrated
the heterozygous status of his mother (Fig. 1). The
proband’s elder brother (BTHS6 in Table 1; IV: three
in Family 4 in Fig. 2) had clinical signs of BTHS and
died of DCM at the age of 7 months, but blood sam￾ples were not available for mutation analysis.
Confirmation of the likely pathogenicity of p.H176R
This variant c.527A > G (p.H176R) was absent in the
database of dbSNP and 1000 Genomes, and not detected
in 120 ethnicity-matched controls. Alignment of the
amino acid sequence of tafazzin proteins showed that
the histidine at position 176 was highly conserved across
species (Table 2). This variant was predicted to be
disease-causing with a score of one by MutationTaster,
to be deleterious with a score of 0.000 by SIFT, and to
be probably damaging with a score of 0.998 by
PolyPhen-2.
Family histories and clinical features
Family history was obtained in the four pedigrees. A
high rate of premature male death was observed in the
four pedigrees and a history of unexplained male fetal
loss was observed in two pedigrees. This included one
male neonatal death in family 1, seven male infant
deaths in family 2, three male fetal stillbirths and four
male neonate/infant/childhood deaths in family 3, one
male fetal stillbirth and three male infant/childhood
deaths in family 4. Taken together, there were four male
fetal stillbirth and 15 premature male deaths in the four
pedigrees. There were no losses of females. The pedigree
charts are shown in Fig. 2.

In addition to the four probands, a thorough pedigree
analysis led to the diagnosis of BTHS in two male family
members, one (BTHS2 in Table 1; II: three in Family 1 in
Fig. 2) with a confirmed TAZ mutation and the other one
(BTHS6 in Table 1; IV: three in Family 4 in Fig. 2) with a
presumptive diagnosis based on clinical signs of BTHS in a
proven pedigree. The clinical features pertinent to the six
patients are described below and summarized in Table 1.

All six patients were born at full term. The median
birth weight was 2350 g (range, 2000–2850 g) and four
patients had a birth weight below 2500 g. All six patients
presented with symptoms prior to 1 year of age. The
median age at presentation was 2.5 months (range, 1.0–
6.5 months). Infection was the first symptoms in three
patients. Cardiac failure was the first symptoms in two
patients. Muscular weakness was the first symptoms in
one patient.
The median age at diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was
3.0 months (range, 1.0–20.0 months). Five patients pre￾sented with symptoms of heart failure within the first
year of life. The oldest patient of the cohort (BTHS3 in
Table 1; IV: one in Family 2 in Fig. 2) presented with
symptomatic cardiomyopathy at the age of 20 months.
Baseline echocardiography revealed left ventricular
dilation with impaired systolic function in the six pa￾tients. The mean LVEDD z-score was 4.6 ± 0.4, the
mean LVEF was 40.3 ± 1.5%, and the mean left ven￾tricular shortening fraction (LVSF) was 19.0 ± 0.8%. In
addition, all the six patients had prominent trabecula￾tions of the left ventricle on echocardiogram, 4 of
which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of LVNC. The
remaining two patients also had prominent trabecula￾tions of the left ventricle but did not meet the diag￾nostic criteria for LVNC. The region most frequently
affected by noncompaction was the apex, followed by
the posterior and lateral walls, mainly in the mid and
apical segments (Fig. 3). Five patients also presented
with dilatation of the left atrium.
The baseline ECG showed normal sinus rhythms in all
six patients. Four patients had normal QRS duration,
while the remaining two had intraventricular conduction
delays. Ventricular repolarization abnormalities were
seen in all six patients, predominantly ST flattening or
T-wave inversion. The median QTc interval was 417 mil￾liseconds (range 341–460 milliseconds), with one patient
having prolonged QTc of 460 milliseconds. No supra￾ventricular arrhythmias were detected in the six patients
on admission. One patient had documented ventricular
arrhythmias during hospitalization.
Failure to thrive was observed in all six patients on ad￾mission. Five patients were below—and one was at—the
3rd percentile in weight for their age. Likewise, five pa￾tients were below the 3rd percentile in height for their
age, and one was at the 10th percentile in height for his
age. Moreover, all six patients had muscle weakness and
delayed developmental milestones, with normal serum
creatine kinase levels. The oldest patient (BTHS3 in
Table 1; IV: one in Family 2 in Fig. 2) of the cohort could
not walk until the age of two.
Complete blood counts with differentials were mea￾sured in all six patients at original presentation. Neutro￾penia was documented in three patients and one of
them had an ANC < 0.5 × 109
/L. However, none of the
six patients had a low total white blood cell count, and
normal hematocrit and platelets were observed in all in￾dividuals. Biochemical analysis of urine organic acids
was performed in five patients, and four of them had a
urinary 3-methylglutaconic level above the upper limit
of normal.
Survival
Five patients died at a median age of 7.5 months (range,
7.0–12.0 months). Patient BTHS1 (II: four in Family 1
in Fig. 2) and BTHS2 (II: three in Family 1 in Fig. 2)
died of cardiac failure associated with high fever at
the age of 7.0 and 7.5 months respectively. Patient
BTHS4 (III: five in Family 3 in Fig. 2) failed to re￾spond to aggressive treatment and died from repeated
ventricular fibrillation when he was 7.5 months old.
BTHS5 (IV: five in Family 4 in Fig. 2) exhibited
chronic heart failure and intermittent neutropenia. He
was hospitalized once for pneumonia and once for
heart failure during 11-month follow-up. He died of
cardiac failure associated with respiratory infection
just beyond 1 year old. BTHS6 (IV: three in Family 4
in Fig. 2) was also hospitalized once for pneumonia
and once for heart failure during 6-month follow-up,
although he did not have documented neutropenia.
He died of sudden cardiac arrest in home at the age
of 7.0 months. The remaining one patient (BTHS3 in
Table 1; IV: one in Family 2 in Fig. 2) showed an im￾provement in cardiac function with standard treat￾ment and his LVSF had increased to 32.5%, but he
had fallen into a coma after suffering from cardiac ar￾rest when he was 33 months old. He was 38 months
old at the last follow-up and showed normal cardiac
function, but remained in a persistent vegetative state.

Discussion
BTHS is thought to be an underdiagnosed cause of
cardiomyopathy in children, though the involvement
of the TAZ gene in common forms of cardiomyop￾athy is largely unknown [10]. To further evaluate the
incidence of TAZ mutations in pediatric cardiomyop￾athy, we performed mutational analysis in a large co￾hort of unselected pediatric patients with primary
cardiomyopathy and identified TAZ mutations in 4/114
(3.5%) male index patients. The prevalence of TAZ muta￾tions in our cohort is similar to those from a comprehen￾sive Australian study, which suggested that BTHS may
constitute up to 4.8% of boys diagnosed with primary car￾diomyopathy [11].
Various cardiac phenotypes have been described in pa￾tients with BTHS, such as DCM, isolated LVNC, HCM,
or endocardial fibroelastosis. Transition between DCM
and HCM phenotypes has also been reported in individ￾uals with BTHS [3, 12]. DCM has been thought to be
the most common cardiac phenotype caused by TAZ
mutations. However, recent studies have indicated a high
prevalence of LVNC in children with BTHS, either alone
or in conjunction with other forms of cardiomyopathy
[4]. In a large cohort study of BTHS, Spencer et al. [13]
retrospectively reviewed echocardiographic images of 30
patients with BTHS and found that half of them had
morphologic features of LVNC. In a French nationwide
cohort study, LVNC was found in a third of patients
with BTHS, although it might have been underestimated
because of the retrospective nature of the study in which
echocardiograms were not reviewed to search for prom￾inent trabeculations [14]. In our present study, a total of
six male children were diagnosed with BTHS and all of
them presented with left ventricular dilation and impaired
systolic function. Moreover, prominent left ventricular
trabeculations were also observed in the six patients, 4 of
which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of LVNC. In con￾trast, no patient with a diagnosis of BTHS presented with
HCM in our cohort. Our results suggested that LVNC
with the DCM phenotype may be a rather common
cardiac phenotype in BTHS, especially in infant-onset
patients.
Cardiomyopathy may be the major clinical manifest￾ation in patients with BTHS, but careful searching often
reveals other signs of this multisystem disease as well as
abnormal metabolites in blood or urine [15]. In our co￾hort, a total of six male patients from four unrelated
families were diagnosed with BTHS. All individuals pre￾sented with documented heart failure and also a wide
range of clinical features typically associated with BTHS
such as neutropenia (3/6), delayed motor development
(6/6), growth retardation (6/6) and 3-methylglutaconic
aciduria (4/5). Furthermore, a high rate of premature
male death was observed in the four pedigrees, which
was consistent with an X-linked recessive pattern. In
addition, a history of unexplained male fetal loss was ob￾served in two pedigrees in our study, indicating that
BTHS could lead to isolated or recurrent male fetal
death as described by Steward et al. [16]. Our findings
suggested that family history plays an important role in
the evaluation of patients with possible BTHS and care￾ful searching for extracardiac features associated with
BTHS can contribute to the diagnosis of the disease.
BTHS is often fatal in infancy or early childhood as a
result of heart failure and/or infections, which were ob￾served in three patients in our cohort. A high prevalence
of cardiac arrhythmia was also observed in our small
series of young children with BTHS. Sudden cardiac
death occurred in two patients during infancy, one
from proven ventricular tachycardia with marked left

ventricular dilation and very poor systolic function,
and one from cardiac arrest with poor but stable car￾diac function. Another patient suffered from cardiac
arrest during a period of apparent well-being when he
was 33 months old with mild left ventricular dilation
and normal systolic function. These findings sug￾gested that the risk of cardiac arrhythmias may be in￾dependent of the degree of left ventricular dilation or
dysfunction, which is consistent with the findings by
Spencer et al. [17].
BTHS is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene located
at Xq28. Encoded by the TAZ gene, tafazzin is a
phospholipid transacylase located in the mitochondrial
inner membrane and plays an important role in the re￾modeling of cardiolipin [18]. Tafazzin harbors five puta￾tive acyltransferase motifs and an integral interfacial
membrane anchor, all of which are highly conserved and
strongly related to the mutations observed in patients
with BTHS [19]. Up to date, more than 160 different
mutations have been reported in the Human Tafazzin
(TAZ) Gene Mutation and Variation Database (http://
www.barthsyndrome.org/), including missense, non￾sense, splicing, and frameshift mutations. In the present
study, four different mutations were identified, two of
which were novel. The novel frameshift mutation,
c.134_136delinsCC (p.H45PfsX38), was predicted to
introduce a premature stop codon at position 83, while
the full-length of tafazzin protein is 292 residues long.
Premature stop codons usually lead to the degradation
of the affected mRNA transcripts by a surveillance path￾way termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [20],
resulting in the loss-of-function of the affected gene.
Notably, a frameshift mutation, c.171delA (p.G58AfsX25),
predicted to truncate at the same stop codon, has already
been described in BTHS patients elsewhere [21], providing
additional evidence to support the causative role of our
newly identified frameshift mutation. The pathogenicity of
the other novel mutation c.527A > G (p.H176R) is sug￾gested by numerous lines of evidence: (i) This variant
c.527A > G (p.H176R) was absent in current databases of
dbSNP and 1000 Genomes, and in 120 ethnicity-matched
controls. (ii) This histidine residue is located in the puta￾tive motif C of the tafazzin protein and is extremely
conserved during evolution, implying its functional im￾portance. (iii) Multiple well-known computer algorithms,
such as MutationTaster, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2, consist￾ently predict that this novel mutation is deleterious and
displays high disease-causing potential. (iv) Family pedi￾gree also indicates that this mutation co-segregates with
disease phenotypes.
BTHS is a multisystem disorder with highly variable
clinical presentations. Early diagnosis and appropriate
treatment may improve the prognosis. Unfortunately,
the diagnosis of this disease is often delayed or missed
because the characteristic symptoms of BHTS may vary
in severity and are not consistently present in every pa￾tient [10]. BTHS is also known as 3-methylglutaconic
aciduria type II, but 3-methylglutaconic aciduria is not
consistently present in every patient with BTHS, as ob￾served in only one patient in this study. Neutropenia is a
classical characteristic of BTHS and represents an im￾portant clue for BTHS diagnosis [14]. However, the ab￾sence of neutropenia in three of the six patients at
diagnosis in our study suggests that a normal ANC
count in male infants with cardiomyopathy does not ex￾clude BTHS. In a large cohort study of BTHS, ninety
percent of patients had a clinical history of cardiomyop￾athy diagnosed at an average age of 5.5 months, but the
genetic diagnosis of BTHS was not made until an aver￾age age of 4.6 years [13]. The use of NGS has recently
been reported as a possible diagnostic strategy in BTHS,
but not yet been widely implemented [22]. The present
study demonstrates that target NGS provides a novel,
rapid, simple, and highly sensitive screening method for
the early detection of this disease.
Conclusions
BTHS should be considered in male children with pri￾mary cardiomyopathy, especially in male infancy with
LVNC. The inclusion of TAZ gene in cardiomyopathy
genetic diagnostic panels may contribute to early diag￾nosis of BTHS.
