The accuracy of the anti-mitochondrial antibody 
and the M2 subtype test for diagnosis of primary 
biliary cirrhosis: a meta-analysis
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diag￾nostic value of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) 
and/or the M2 subtype (AMA-M2) in patients with primary 
biliary cirrhosis (PBC). AMA/AMA-M2 data were obtained 
by searching electronic databases. Studies showing AMA/
AMA-M2 results in patients with PBC and control groups 
with other liver diseases or healthy livers were included. 
The quality of the involved studies was assessed using the 
QUADAS tool. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 
calculated, and stratified analysis was performed accord￾ing to possible heterogeneity sources. The pooled AMA 
(all methods) sensitivity and specificity were 84.5% (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 83.3%–85.6%) and 97.8% (95% 
CI 97.6%–98.0%), respectively. The positive and negative 
likelihood ratios were 25.201 (95% CI 17.583–36.118) and 
0.162 (95% CI 0.131–0.199), respectively. The current evi￾dence suggests that AMA and AMA-M2 show favorable 
accuracy for the diagnosis of PBC with high specificity 
and sensitivity. AMA is a better and more comprehensive 
marker than AMA-M2. The accuracy established in this 
meta-analysis is based on clinical studies using patient 
cohorts from different ethnicities.

Introduction
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic 
autoimmune liver disease with a progressive course and 
an obscure etiology [1–3]. Recent data suggest that it may 
be due to a combination of genetic [4], infectious [5], 
immunizing, and environmental [6] factors. It is charac￾terized by the destruction of small, intrahepatic bile ducts, 
and it mainly affects women over the age of 40. PBC diag￾nosis is based on liver biochemical tests, such as alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate-aminotransferase 
(AST); histology; and the detection of circulating autoanti￾bodies, including the anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), 
2-oxo-glutaric acid dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), 
anti-GP210, and/or anti-SP100 [7]. In 2009, the American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) pro￾posed that PBC diagnosis is generally based on the follow￾ing criteria: 1) biochemical evidence of cholestasis with 
elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity; 2) the pres￾ence of AMA; and 3) histopathological evidence of non￾suppurative cholangitis and the destruction of small- or 
medium-sized bile ducts if a biopsy is performed [8].
AMA is considered a serological hallmark for PBC diag￾nosis; the M2 antibody is the most specific antibody known 
[3, 9, 10]. AMA/AMA-M2 is routinely detected through 
indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using rat kidney/
stomach/liver sections or HEp-2 cell line substrates and/
or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using 
purified bovine or porcine heart mitochondrial fractions. 
However, AMA does not anticipate the severity of PBC and 
lacks prognostic value [11, 12]. Furthermore, some patients 
with laboratory tests and liver histological findings indica￾tive of PBC do not have detectable AMA [13].
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
sensitivity and specificity of AMA-M2 compared with AMA

in the diagnosis of PBC. Therefore, we conducted a meta￾analysis and review of related literature.
Methods
Data sources and searches
Studies published in English or Chinese were identified 
through searches in PubMed (Medline), the Cochrane 
Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure 
(CNKI), and Technology of Chongqing (VIP) using the fol￾lowing keywords: “Anti-mitochondrial Antibody”, “AMA,” 
“Autoantibody”, “Primary Biliary Cirrhosis”, “PBC” and 
“cholestatic liver diseases”. Two reviewers (Shiling Hu 
and Fengrong Zhao) independently performed the litera￾ture search. The search was performed without ethnicity 
or geographic region limits. Studies found were retrieved 
and examined carefully.
Study selection
We included literature if the studies met the following 
criteria: 1) assess the diagnostic accuracy of the AMA test 
on PBC with full-text articles; 2) present sensitivity and 
specificity or sufficient information to construct two-by￾two tables; 3) for qualified studies with data published 
more than once, only articles with the largest sample size 
of patients were included; and 4) no duplicate data. The 
exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) case reports, letters, 
reviews, conferences, meta-analysis, and editorial arti￾cles; 2) overlapping data; and/or 3) not enough informa￾tion or data were reported.
Data extraction and study quality 
assessment
The following data were independently extracted from 
each article by two investigators (Shiling Hu and Fen￾grong Zhao): name of the first author; year of publica￾tion; country of origin; ethnicity of the study population; 
control sources; PBC diagnosis criteria; antibody testing 
methods; antibody type; test results including true posi￾tive (TP), false-positive (FP), false-negative (FN), and true 
negative (TN); the sensitivity and specificity; and essen￾tial sample size. The quality assessment of diagnostic 
accuracy studies (QUADAS) tool was used to assess each 
studies’ quality, and studies were scored as “Yes (high 
quality)”, “No (low quality)”, or “Unclear”. We (Shiling Hu 
and Qingsong Wang) evaluated each article independently 
and discussed discrepancies when they were found.
Data analysis
Meta-analysis was performed using MetaDiSc, version 
1.4 (Hospital Universitario Ramony Cajal, Madrid, Spain) 
and Review Manager 5.2 (Oxford, UK: The Cochran Col￾laboration). We calculated the sensitivity and specificity 
as well as the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR ± ) 
for each study. The Q test and I2
 test were performed to 
examine whether variations were caused by heterogeneity 
or sampling errors (chance). Fixed-effects methods were 
used if the result of the Q test was not significant (p > 0.10 or 
I2 < 50%) or the random-effects model was used. Subgroup 
analysis was performed to assess whether the threshold 
effect and heterogeneity among studies existed according 
to different measurement methods, autoantibody type, 
and ethnicities. The ethnicities used were Caucasians, 
Africans, South Americans and Asians. Summary receiver 
operator characteristic (SROC) curves, which show the 
relationship between sensitivity and 1-specificity, were 
constructed to summarize these results. Q* values, which 
show the point where sensitivity equals specificity, were 
calculated from the SROC curves. Finally, the funnel plot 
was used to assess publication bias.
Results
The characteristics of included studies
The search strategy retrieved 2851 potentially relevant 
studies. After reading titles and abstracts, 2586 citations 
were excluded according to the selection criteria. Accord￾ing to the inclusion criteria, 24 full-text studies [14–37] 
were included in this meta-analysis, and 241 studies were 
excluded: 188 articles had no direct link with the main 
subject; four of them were reviews; 47 were incomplete 
result data and two duplicated studies. Figure 1 illus￾trates the study selection procedure. These 24 case control 
studies included 2992 PBC cases and 18,467 other liver 
disease/healthy controls. The baseline characteristics of 
all included studies are summarized in Table 1.
Quality evaluation of literature
Most of the studies included in this meta-analysis had high 
quality with above seven satisfied items in 11 items using 

Hu et al.: Diagnostic accuracy of AMA and AMA-M2 in PBC      1535
QUADAS tool [38]. None of the studies satisfied all criteria 
of the quality checklist. Four studies satisfied nine items 
of 11 standard items, 10 studies satisfied eight items, five 
studies satisfied seven items, four studies satisfied six items 
and one study satisfied five items. Studies scored poorly 
on items regarding the reference standard independent of 
the index test and blinding of the index test results. The 
included articles’ qualities are shown in Figure 2.
Data synthesis and meta-analysis
The heterogeneity analysis showed less homogeneity 
(p = 0.000, I2
 = 79.7%), so the random-effects model was used 
to perform the meta-analysis. The positive and negative 
LRs were 25.201 (95% CI 17.583–36.118) and 0.162 (95% CI 
0.131–0.199), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and speci￾ficity were 84.5% (95% CI 83.3%–85.6%) and 97.8% (95% CI 
97.6%–98.0%), respectively. The pooled sensitivity, speci￾ficity, LR+, LR−, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for AMA 
(all methods) and AMA-M2 are summarized in Table 2. The 
forest plot and SROC curve for AMA and AMA-M2 are shown 
in Figures 3 and 4. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient 
was found using the MetaDiSc. For AMA the Spearman’s 
correlation coefficient was 0.168 (p = 0.479), whereas it 
was 0.093 (p = 0.722) for AMA-M2. Meta-regression analysis 
showed that heterogeneity is related to ethnicity. Stratified 
analyses were performed; the results are summarized in 
Table 2.
Diagnostic accuracy of AMA/AMA-M2 
detection in different ethnicities (subgroup 
analysis)
Seven studies reported data about Europeans [18, 25, 26, 
30, 31, 34, 35], three about South Americans [21, 23, 37], 12 
about Asians [14–17, 20, 22, 27–29, 32, 33, 36] and one about 
Africans [24]. Significant differences between the four eth￾nicities were found (Table 2).
Detection by different methods
AMA/AMA-M2 were measured using IIF in 20 studies [14, 
17–22, 24, 25, 27–37], in 12 studies [16, 17, 21–26, 29, 30, 35, 
36] with the ELISA method, in three studies [15, 22, 30] 
with the Western blot technique, and in one study [24] 
with the Dot blot technique. The sensitivities of AMA 
detected with IIF ranged from 43.8% to 100% (pooled 
Sen: 84.6%, 95% CI 83.1%–86.0%) whereas specificities 
ranged from 83.3% to 100% (pooled Spe: 98.4%, 95%

Discussion
PBC is an organ-specific autoimmune disease and is the 
most common of all autoimmune liver diseases (ALD). It 
mainly affects middle-aged women and is characterized 
by damage to biliary epithelial cells, cholestasis, and 
liver cirrhosis and failure. Estimates of PBC incidence 
and prevalence are quite different in different geographic 
areas and range from 2.7 to 32.2 and/or 16–492 per million, 
respectively. The reported number keeps rising due to 
the improvement of diagnosis methods [20, 39–41]. PBC

patients may present with symptoms such as fatigue, 
pruritus, and/or jaundice, but most of them are asymp￾tomatic. Some may present with complications of portal 
hypertension such as ascites, hypersplenism, hepatic 
encephalopathy, esophageal variceal bleeding, and gas￾trointestinal bleeding [3]. Unexpectedly, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) had a relatively high prevalence in PBC 
[42]. The early and accurate diagnosis of PBC in clinical 
practice is important. PBC diagnosis is based on estab￾lished criteria including cholestatic liver tests, a positive 
AMA test, and histopathologic evidence. PBC is grouped 
into four histologic stages; however, the liver is not 
affected symmetrically, and a single biopsy might demon￾strate the presence of all four stages at the same time [3]. 
Furthermore, liver biopsies pose a small but significant 
risk of fatal hemorrhage. Consequently, serum-specific 
biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of PBC are vital 
for clinical applications.
In this study, pooled AMA (all methods) sensitiv￾ity and specificity were 84.5% and 97.8%, respectively.

Through meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity and specific￾ity of the AMA-M2 subtype (the detection methods are 
ELISA, WB and Dot blot: Sen = 84.3%, Spe = 94.8%) for 
PBC diagnosis was not as good as total AMA (all methods: 
Sen = 84.5%, Spe = 97.8%), which indicates that total AMA 
is a better and more comprehensive marker for PBC diag￾nosis. Both IIF for AMA and ELISA for AMA-M2 showed 
high specificity above 90% and relatively low sensitivity 
above 80%. As to the different antigen sources of ELISA 
kits, our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of MIT3-
based ELISA (Sen = 79.7%) is not good enough. The anti￾M2-3E ELISA improves the diagnostic accuracy compared 
with those of anti-MIT3 ELISA and conventional anti-PDC 
ELISA [43]. Compared with IIF and ELISA, the Western 
blot has the highest sensitivity (88.3%) but low specific￾ity (91.7%). However, a small number of patients have 
PBC without testing positive for AMA; these patients are 
often diagnosed with AMA-negative PBC. AMA-negative 
PBC patients, a subgroup of patients with undetectable 
AMA using routine methods, have analogous clinical 
courses as well as serum biochemical and hepatic histo￾logical features to AMA-positive patients [44–47]; these 
patients’ diagnosis is challenging. Interestingly, most of 
these patients have higher frequencies of positive rates for 
anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-smooth muscle 
antibodies (ASMAs) [48–57]. A meta-analysis conducted 
by Huang et al. showed that sensitivity and specificity in 
GP210 detection in a Chinese population with PBC were 
0.34 and 0.98 [58]. The prevalence of SP100 in PBC is 
about 20%, and it appears highly specific (94%) for a PBC 
diagnosis [34]. However, of 15 patients with PBC who do 
not have detectable AMA, seven patients have ANA with a 
nuclear rim pattern [32]. ANA directs against the nuclear 
pore membrane GP210 or the nuclear protein SP100 and 
is highly specific for and correlated with PBC prognosis; 
it can be used as a useful supplement for diagnosis, espe￾cially in AMA-negative PBC patients [59–64].
Little difference was found in sensitivity in our strati￾fied analyses of ethnicities. The sensitivity is highest in 
Africans (93.9%), followed by in Asians (88.7%), then in 
Europeans (81.5%) and lowest in South Americans (75.8%). 
Different geographical area and selecting cases according 
to genetic and environmental factors could explain the 
discrepancy [65, 66]. As in the majority of autoimmune 
diseases, PBC is likely to be genetically complex. The role 
of genetic factors in PBC is strongly supported by the 63% 
concordance rate in monozygotic twins; this rate is second 
only to celiac disease, which is the highest reported in 
autoimmunity [67]. Over the past few years, a number of 
genes, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) 
[68], HLA DRB1*08 [69], tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
[70], and programmed cell-death 1 (PDCD1) [71, 72], have 
been significantly associated with PBC susceptibility.
Heterogeneity is a latent problem when interpreting 
results in meta-analysis. On one hand, the Spearman’s 
correlation coefficient indicates that no heterogeneity 
from threshold effects arises when differences in sensi￾tivities and specificities occur due to different cut-offs or 
thresholds used in different studies to define positive or 
negative test results. On the other hand, the pooled DOR 

Hu et al.: Diagnostic accuracy of AMA and AMA-M2 in PBC      1539
was used to discuss the heterogeneity caused by non￾threshold effects. We found that the DOR of each study did 
not distribute along a straight line with the pooled DOR 
in the forest plots. Meanwhile, the Q* (199.67, p = 0.0000) 
implied a non-threshold effect in the analysis. Different 
ethnicities, measurement methods, or autoantibody types 
may contribute to heterogeneity sources. We performed a 
meta-regression analysis to assess the contribution of the 
factors above and found that ethnicities and autoantibody 
types were the sources of heterogeneity. Next, the sub￾group analysis was performed.
Similar to other meta-analyses of diagnostic tests, the 
limitations of our work should be considered. First, we 
did not compare the sensitivity and specificity of AMA/
AMA-M2 using a combination of AMA/AMA-M2 and GP210 
and/or SP100 due to a lack of data. Second, we did not 
compare the sensitivity and specificity of the source of 
reagents in ELISA due to a lack of documents. Last, only 
one study was included the Dot blot method, and we could 
not assess the utility.
In conclusion, despite the limitations mentioned above, 
the current evidence suggests that AMA and AMA-M2 are

favorable serum markers with high specificities and relative 
moderate sensitivities for PBC diagnosis. However, deter￾mining PBC diagnoses and prognoses remains challenging. 
In order to decrease the misdiagnosis rate, a combination of 
AMA/AMA-M2 and the GP210 and/or SP100 antibodies may 
be necessary in clinical applications.
