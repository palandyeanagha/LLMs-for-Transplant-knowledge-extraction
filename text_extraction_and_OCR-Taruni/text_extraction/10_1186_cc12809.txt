Abstract
Introduction: Hypotension in septic patients results from hypovolemia, vasodilatation and hyporeactivity to
vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II. The AT1 receptor-associated protein 1 (Arap1) is expressed in vascular
smooth muscle cells and increases the surface expression of the AT1-receptor in vitro. We hypothesized that
dysregulation of Arap1 may contribute to vascular hyporeactivity to angiotensin II during endotoxemia.
Methods: Arap1-deficient mice were used to assess the role of Arap1 in sepsis-induced hypotension. The isolated
perfused kidney was used as an in vitro model to determine the relevance of Arap1 for vascular resistance and
sensitivity to angiotensin II.
Results: During endotoxemia, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased in both genotypes, with the time course
of sepsis-induced hypotension being markedly accelerated in Arap1-/- compared to +/+ mice. However, baseline MAP
was similar in Arap1-/- and wildtype mice (102 ± 2 vs.103 ± 2 mmHg; telemetry measurements; n = 10; P = 0.66).
Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections (3 mg/kg), Arap1 expression was successively down-regulated in the
wildtype mice, reaching levels below 10% of baseline expression. The endotoxemia-related decline in Arap1 expression
could be recapitulated in cultured mesangial cells by incubation with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor a and interferon g. Plasma renin concentration was increased in Arap1-/- mice compared to wildtype
mice (66 ± 6 vs. 41 ± 4 ng AngI/ml/h; n = 23; P = 0.001), presumably contributing to preserved MAP under baseline
conditions. The sensitivity of the vasculature to angiotensin II was reduced in Arap1-/- compared to +/+ mice, as
determined in the isolated perfused kidney.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that down-regulation of Arap1 expression during sepsis contributes to the
development of hypotension by causing reduced vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II.
Introduction
Circulatory failure is the most common and fatal hallmark
of sepsis in critically ill patients. The key hemodynamic
characteristic of sepsis is arterial vasodilation associated
with a decrease in total vascular resistance. Hypotension
in septic patients results from both hypovolemia and
inadequate vasodilatation [1]. Typically, septic patients
show marked hyporeactivity to both endogenously gener￾ated and exogenously administered vasoconstrictors [1,2].
The resistance to vasoconstrictors includes otherwise
potent factors such as norepinephrine, endothelins, and
angiotensin II. Down-regulation of the corresponding
receptors, such as adrenergic a-receptors, ETA receptors
and angiotensin AT1 receptors, is involved in the func￾tional resistance to vasopressor hormones. Furthermore,
because the concentrations of catecholamines, endothelins
and angiotensin II are markedly elevated during sepsis,
their corresponding receptors may be desensitized [3-6].
Additionally, the excess presence of vasodilatory sub￾stances, such as nitric oxide and prostanoids, may cause
the maximum dilatation of resistance vessels and may
exceed the regulatory range of vascular smooth muscle * Correspondence: hayo@castrop.com

cells, which is usually determined by the balanced pre￾sence of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators [7].
Diminished vasoconstrictor function may be related to
reduced receptor transcription, translation and/or mem￾brane trafficking [8-13]. For the latter, the involvement
of receptor-associated proteins might be relevant,
including the recently discovered angiotensin II AT1
receptor-associated proteins [8,14]. Several different
receptor-associated proteins have been described for the
AT1 receptor, which is the most relevant mediator of
the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Among these, the
AT1-associated protein Arap1 (AT1 receptor-associated
protein 1) appears to be most relevant because it is
expressed predominantly in the vasculature of many
organs, overlapping in location with AT1 receptors
[15-18]. Arap1 supports the trafficking of the AT1
receptor to the cell membrane, leading to locally
enhanced sensitivity [17]. Furthermore, the expression
of Arap1 is regulated in a manner such that the pre￾sence of angiotensin II results in a marked down-regula￾tion of Arap1, establishing a local negative feedback
loop by reducing the vasculature’s sensitivity when
angiotensin II concentrations rise [18].
In the present study, we used Arap1-deficient mice to
address the hypothesis that Arap1 might be involved in
the vasculature’s loss of sensitivity to angiotensin II dur￾ing sepsis.
We found that during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
sepsis in mice, Arap1 expression was markedly down￾regulated; Arap1 expression was similarly reduced in cul￾tured cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
The blood pressure homeostasis during endotoxemia was
more severely compromised in Arap1-deficient mice than
in wildtypes, suggesting that down-regulation of Arap1
expression during the course of sepsis may contribute to
the development of hyporeactivity to angiotensin II.
Methods
Animal experiments
Six- to nine-week-old male Arap1-/- and wildtype litter￾mates derived from heterozygous breeding pairs were
used in the experiments [19]. Unless otherwise noted, the
animals had free access to standard rodent chow and tap
water. The animals were housed with a 12 hour:12 hour
day:night cycle. All animal experiments were approved by
local ethics committees (Regierung der Oberpfalz for the
University of Regensburg and the Animal Care Commit￾tee of Kumamoto University) and performed according
to the National Institutes of Health’s Guidelines for the
Use of Laboratory Animals. In addition to baseline mea￾surements, the following experimental protocol were
used: (i) animals received the angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in their drinking water
(10 mg/kg/d), and (ii) to induce sepsis, mice received a
single i.p. injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma￾Aldrich, Munich, Germany, 3 mg/kg).
Blood pressure measurement by radio-telemetry
The Data Sciences International telemetry system (St. Paul,
MN, USA) was used for the experiments. Transmitters
(model TA11PA-C10) were magnetically activated >24
hours before implantation. The mice were anesthetized
with ketamine and xylazine (90 and 10 mg/kg, respec￾tively), and the telemeter catheter was inserted into the left
carotid artery and advanced into the aortic arch, with the
telemeter body positioned in a subcutaneous pocket on the
right flank. After a one-week recovery period, recordings
began on the morning of the eighth day, with 10-second
samplings every two minutes for at least three days for
each animal. Radio signals were processed using a model
RPC-1 receiver, a 20-channel data exchange matrix, APR-1
ambient pressure monitor, and a Data Quest ART Silver
2.3 acquisition system (Data Sciences International, St.Paul,
MN, USA). The recording room was maintained at 21°C to
22°C with a 12-hour light: 12-hour dark cycle [20].
Glomerular filtration (GFR) measurements
The GFR of conscious mice was measured by fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled sinistrin clearance (a gift
from Dr. Schock-Kusch, University of Heidelberg,
Germany) after a single retro-orbital injection and conse￾cutive blood sampling from the tail vein, as described
previously [20].
Plasma and urine analysis
Urinary osmolarity was determined using the freezing￾point depression method [21]. Plasma and urine electro￾lytes were determined by standard clinical chemistry
methods (IDEXX Veterinary Services, Ludwigsburg,
Germany).
Measurement of plasma renin concentration by
radioimmunoassay
For measurements of plasma renin concentrations, blood
was collected from conscious mice by puncturing the sub￾mandibular vessels with a 19-G needle. Approximately
20 µl of blood were collected into an ethylenediaminete￾traacetic acid (EDTA)-containing microhematocrit tube.
Red cells and plasma were separated by centrifugation; the
plasma was kept frozen until renin measurements. Renin
activity was measured by radioimmunoassay using a
20-fold dilution of 12 μl of plasma, (DiaSorin, Stillwater,
MN, USA) as generation of Ang I following the addition
of excess exogenous rat substrate (plasma renin concen￾tration, PRC), with final plasma dilutions varying between
1:500 and 1:1,000. Ang I generation was determined for a
three-hour incubation period at 37°C and expressed as an
hourly average. In each assay, substrate without plasma

was incubated for the same time, and any background Ang
I formation was subtracted from the plasma-containing
samples. In addition, background Ang I levels were deter￾mined in a plasma aliquot kept frozen without the addi￾tion of substrate until assaying [22].
Arap1 expression analysis
The Arap1 mRNA was determined using quantitative RT￾PCR (Light Cycler System, Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
as described in detail recently [18].
Cell culture experiments
Studies were performed in cultured rat glomerular mesan￾gial cells (a gift from Dr. Eberhardt, Johann Wolfgang
Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). This
cell line expresses both Arap1 and the angiotensin receptors
AT1 and AT2. The cells were grown as described previously
[23]. Briefly, rat glomerular mesangial cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 (PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) sup￾plemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin￾streptomycin (100 U/ml, 100 μg/ml, Biochrom, Berlin,
Deutschland), and 0.66 U/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Munich, Germany) at 37°C and 5% CO2. One day before
the experiments, the FCS was reduced to 0.5% and penicil￾lin-streptomycin was omitted from the medium. To address
the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on Arap1 expres￾sion, interleukin-1 (50 ng/ml), TNF-a (100 ng/ml), or inter￾feron- g (IFN-g) (100 ng/ml) was added to the wells. After
20 hours of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS,
suspended in TRIzol reagent and stored at −80°C until
further use. Unless it is otherwise stated, six wells of cells
were investigated for each experimental condition.
Isolated perfused mouse kidney
>Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of 12 mg/kg xylazine and 80 mg/kg ketamine-HCl. The
abdominal aorta was cannulated, and the right kidney was
excised, placed in a thermostated moistening chamber
(37°C), and perfused at constant pressure (100 mmHg).
Finally, the renal vein was cannulated, and samples of the
venous perfusate were taken every three minutes for deter￾mination of renin activity, as described above. The basic
perfusion medium consisted of a modified Krebs-Henseleit
solution, supplemented with 6 g/100 ml BSA and human
red blood cells (10% hematocrit). The perfusate flow was
monitored during the experiment. To assess the effect of
angiotensin II on the renal perfusate flow and renin secre￾tion, angiotensin II was added to the perfusate to a final
concentration of 0, 10, 30, 100, 300 and 1,000 pM.

Results
Blood pressure in Arap1-/- and +/+ mice during LPS￾induced sepsis
To address the relevance of Arap1 for vascular resistance
and blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular parameters
were measured in the Arap1-/- and wildtype mice using
radio-telemetry over a period of 72 h (n = 5). As shown
in Figure 1, the arterial blood pressure and activity scores
under baseline conditions showed a circadian rhythm for
both genotypes, with phases of activity during the light￾off period and resting during the light-on period
(12 hour:12 hour rhythm). Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
averaged 102.8 ± 2.0 vs. 101.6 ± 1.6 mmHg (P = 0.66)
during the light-off period, and 98.7 ± 1.9 vs. 98.3 ± 1.4
mmHg (P = 0.87) during the light-on period for wildtype
mice vs. Arap1-/-. Similarly, the wildtype and Arap1-
deficient mice did not differ in their systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and activity
score.
During endotoxemia-induced sepsis, the blood pressure
of Arap1-/- and wildtype mice was measured for seven
hours after a single LPS (3 mg/kg) injection using radio￾telemetry (n = 10 each). The activity scores reflecting the
movement of the mice over the receiver grid were low in
both genotypes during the experiment (0.23 ± 0.09 vs.
0.32 ± 0.17 for Arap1-/- and +/+ mice, respectively; P =
0.60). As shown in the tracings in Figure 2, one hour after
LPS injection (3 mg/kg), the MAP dropped significantly in
both genotypes, averaging 100.3 ± 4.1 vs. 84.1 ± 2.6
mmHg for the Arap1-/- mice pre- and post-sepsis, respec￾tively (P = 0.001), and 104.0 ± 3.0 mm vs. 93.3 ± 1.2 Hg
for the wildtype mice pre- and post-sepsis, respectively
(P = 0.013). Thus, the MAP fell to significantly lower
values in the Arap1-/- compared with the values in the
wildtype mice (P = 0.006). During the following two
hours, MAP partly recovered in both genotypes, but the
values remained significantly lower in the Arap1-/- than
in the wildtype mice (90.4 ± 2.0 vs. 101.1 ± 2.3 mmHg;
P = 0.002). Between five and six hours after LPS injection,
the MAP reached a minimum, with similar values
in Arap1-/- (74.8 ± 6.0 mmHg) and wildtype mice (76.7 ±
3.7 mmHg; P = 0.35).
Blood pressure during LPS-induced sepsis and
concomitant RAS blockade
Because of the MAP differences between the Arap1-/- and
+/+ mice, we assessed the impact of RAS activation on
blood pressure regulation during sepsis-induced hypoten￾sion. Before the injection of LPS, mice were pretreated
with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg/d) for three
consecutive days. Enalapril reduced the MAP in both
genotypes. MAP before LPS injection was numerically
lower in the enalapril-pretreated Arap1-/- mice than
in the wildtypes, without reaching levels of significance

(84.3 ± 1.9 vs. 90.7 ± 3.4 mmHg in Arap1-/- and +/+ mice,
respectively; n = 5; P = 0.17) whereas systolic blood
pressure was significantly lower in Arap1-/- mice (103.1 ±
1.0 vs. 109.5 ± 2.2 for Arap1-/- and +/+, respectively;
P = 0.048). Two hours after the LPS injection, the MAP
in the wildtype mice fell to 76 ± 4.0 mmHg and reached
a plateau phase before decreasing to a minimum of 57.7 ±
9.8 mmHg 6.5 hours after LPS injection (Figure 3). Thus,

enalapril blunted the transient blood pressure recovery
that was observed in the previous experiment in the
absence of enalapril. In the Arap1-/- mice, the MAP two
hours after the LPS injection was significantly lower than
in the wildtype mice (63.0 ± 1.3 vs. 76.0 ± 4.0 mmHg; P =
0.04). The MAP levels in the Arap1-/- mice subsequently
continued to fall to a minimum at 6.5 hours after the LPS
injection (54.0 ± 1.5 mmHg), not different from the levels
in the wildtypes (57.7 ± 9.8 mmHg) (Figure 3).
In summary, during endotoxemia the blood pressure
homeostasis in the Arap1-deficient mice was more
severely compromised than in wildtype mice. The activa￾tion of the RAS during LPS-induced sepsis apparently sup￾ported a partial and transient recovery of the blood
pressure.
Expression of Arap1 during LPS-induced sepsis: in vivo
and in vitro experiments
Despite the activation of the RAS, hypotension associated
with tissue hypoperfusion is a common symptom in septic
patients. We hypothesized that changes in Arap1 expres￾sion under septic conditions may contribute to the blunted
vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II during sepsis. There￾fore, the Arap1 expression was determined in various
organs of the mice following LPS injection. Two hours
after LPS injection, the Arap1 mRNA expression in the
kidney was significantly down-regulated to 59 ± 13% of
the control levels and successively decreased to 33 ± 10%,
9 ± 1% and 8 ± 0.2% of the controls, 3, 6 and 12 hours
after LPS-injection, respectively (Figure 4A). Similar
results were obtained for other tissues, such as the heart,
aorta, adrenal gland and lung (Figure 4B). To further
assess the mechanism underlying the down-regulation of
Arap1 expression during sepsis, additional in vitro studies
were performed. The Arap1 expression in cultured mesan￾gial cells of rats was determined following the incubation
with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Incubation with a cyto￾kine mix containing IL-1b (50 ng/mL), TNF-a (100 ng/
mL) and IFN-g (100 ng/mL) resulted in a 40 ± 7%
decrease of the Arap1 mRNA expression compared with
that of the controls (P = 0.01; Figure 5A). Similar results
were obtained for the incubation of cultured mesangial
cells with individual cytokines, such as TNF-a (49 ± 7%
of the controls; P = 0.002) or IFN-g (38 ± 3% of the con￾trols; P = 0.0002). By contrast, the incubation with IL-1b
alone did not alter the Arap1 mRNA expression (P = 0.4;
Figure 5B).
Vascular reactivity and renin secretion in vitro: isolated
perfused kidney
Systemic blood pressure is controlled by multiple
humoral and neuronal factors. Because of the unaltered

blood pressure in the Arap1-/- and +/+ mice under base￾line conditions and considering the multiple factors
impinging on vascular resistance in vivo, we used the iso￾lated perfused kidney model to assess the relevance of
Arap1 for vascular reactivity in a controlled in vitro
model. After pre-relaxation using the b1-adrenoreceptor
agonist isoproterenol (10 nM), the renal perfusate flow
during a constant perfusion pressure (100 mmHg) was
reduced by angiotensin II in a dose-dependent manner,
as shown in Figure 6A. The angiotensin II-induced
changes in perfusate flow were right-shifted in isolated
perfused kidneys from the Arap1-/- mice compared with
those in the kidneys from the wildtype mice. Conse￾quently, the renal vascular resistance for a given dose of
angiotensin II was lower in the kidneys from the
Arap1-/- than in those from the wildtype mice (Figure
6A). The most notable differences between Arap1-/-
mice and wildtype controls were observed in the low
physiological range from 10 to 100 pM (n = 5 each
group; P <0.01 between genotypes for 10 pM and 30
pM). The maximum vascular responses (1,000 pM angio￾tensin II) were similar in both genotypes and resulted in
a decrease of the perfusate flow by 80% (Figure 6A).
Renin secretion from the isolated perfused kidneys was
determined in parallel to the perfusate flow to address the
renin secretory capacity of Arap1-/- and wildtype mice
kidneys in the absence of modulating systemic factors. To
mimic the in vivo stimulatory input of the sympathetic
nervous system on renin secretion in the isolated kidney,
isoproterenol (10 nM) was added to the perfusate. The
renin secretion after stimulation with isoproterenol
(10 nM) was markedly enhanced in kidneys from Arap1-/-
mice compared with those from the wildtype mice (1,427
± 318 vs. 667 ± 174 ng ang I/ml/h; P <0.001). By contrast,
the relative suppression (percent of isoproterenol) of renin
secretion by angiotensin II did not differ between the gen￾otypes, suggesting an unaltered negative feedback function
of angiotensin II (Figure 6B). Similarly, like in the isolated
perfused kidney, the PRC in vivo was increased by 62% in
Arap1-/- compared to wildtype mice. Thus, the PRC was
66.2 ± 6 in Arap1-/- and 40.8 ± 4 ng Ang I/ml/h in wild￾types (n = 23 per group; P = 0.001; Figure 7). Baseline
parameters of renal function did not differ between the
Arap1-/- and wildtype mice. Thus, GFR averaged 308 ± 13
and 301 ± 12 µl/min, in Arap1-/- and wildtype mice,
respectively (n = 5; P = 0.68; not shown). Similarly, the
plasma electrolyte concentrations and urine electrolyte:
osmolality ratios did not differ considerably between
the Arap1-/- and wildtype mice, as summarized in
Table 1.
Discussion
Arap1 is a protein that interacts with the angiotensin II
AT1 receptor, and in vitro studies suggested that Arap1
facilitates the surface expression of the AT1 receptor and,
hence, acts as a positive local regulator of AT1 receptor
function [17]. In the present study, we used Arap1-deficient
mice to investigate the possible involvement of Arap1

in sepsis-induced hypotension. We hypothesized that a dys￾regulation of Arap1 expression during sepsis may be
involved in the hyporeactivity of vascular AT1 receptors,
contributing to a decrease in the total vascular resistance.
Vascular hypo-responsiveness to pressor substances,
such as angiotensin II contributes to hypotension in septic
patients [1]. Arap1 was shown to enhance AT1 receptor

was functionally confirmed at the whole organ level in our
study. Therefore, we hypothesized that Arap1-dependent
modulation of the AT1 receptor may contribute to
angiotensin resistance during sepsis. In fact, the Arap1
expression in several organs declined during the course of
the experimental sepsis, reaching levels below 10% of the
baseline. This down-regulation of Arap1 expression could
be recapitulated in vitro, when cultured mesangial cells

a period of three minutes. (B) Renin secretion from isolated kidneys perfused according to the same protocol (n = 5).

were exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
TNFa and IFNg. Thus, the reduced Arap1 expression dur￾ing sepsis may be mediated by pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines, all of which are known to be markedly elevated
during endotoxemia [23,24]. Furthermore, Arap1 abun￾dance has been shown to be dependent on angiotensin II
levels, with angiotensin II suppressing Arap1 expression;
the regulation of Arap1 expression was related to changes
in transcriptional activity, because Arap1 mRNA and pro￾tein abundances changed in parallel under all conditions
[18]. Plasma angiotensin II concentrations were shown
to be 5-fold increased six hours after the induction of
endotoxemia by a single LPS injection in rats [23],
and PRA was elevated up to 25-fold in septic human
patients [5]. Thus, angiotensin II in combination with
pro-inflammatory cytokines likely accounts for the down￾regulation of Arap1 during LPS-induced sepsis. The virtual
loss of Arap1 during endotoxemia would reduce the sur￾face expression of the AT1 receptor in the vasculature and
would contribute to the hyporesponsiveness to angiotensin
II observed during sepsis. With the endotoxemia-triggered
down-regulation of Arap1 to levels below 10% of the con￾trol level, the wildtype mice approximated the Arap1-defi￾cient mice. Thus, despite the marked blood pressure
differences between the Arap1+/+ and -/- mice during the
early time course of endotoxemia, blood pressure was
indistinguishable between the genotypes when the blood
pressure nadir was reached, approximately six hours after
the LPS administration. At this particular time, the Arap1
expression in the wildtype mice was as low as 9% of the
baseline abundance, similar to the situation in the Arap1-/-
mice.
In contrast to the baseline conditions, when the MAP
was maintained in the Arap1-/- mice, the fall in blood
pressure after the induction of endotoxemia was more pro￾nounced in the Arap1-/- than in the wildtype mice, at least
before the minimum values were reached after approxi￾mately six hours. Apparently, when the RAS is stimulated,

required to maintain the MAP, the relevance of Arap1 for
AT1 receptor surface expression is unmasked. Our experi￾ments with mice pre-treated with enalapril further suggest
that blood pressure maintenance is more dependent on
intact AT1 receptor activity during sepsis than under nor￾mal conditions. Thus, enalapril reduced the baseline MAP
from 104.9 to 98 mmHg in the wildtype mice and from
106.8 to 92 mmHg in the Arap1-/- mice before the LPS
administration, a difference of 6.9 and 14.8 mmHg, respec￾tively. However, six hours after the induction of endotoxe￾mia, the blood pressure differences caused by enalapril
increased to -19 in the Arap1-/- and to -21 mmHg in the
wildtype mice, with no difference between the genotypes,
suggesting that the relative contribution of angiotensin II
to maintaining MAP had increased.
A closer inspection of the time course of the MAP
after LPS injection revealed a transient recovery of the
blood pressure approximately 2.5 hours after the induc￾tion of endotoxemia. This transient recovery has been
suggested to be related to an activation of the RAS and
an increased endothelin production [25]. Our data are
consistent with this assumption because the transient
increase in MAP was blunted in the presence of enala￾pril in both genotypes, suggesting that an activation of
the RAS predominantly accounts for the temporary sta￾bilization of blood pressure. It should be noted that the
Arap1 expression at this time point was only slightly
reduced when compared with the expression during the
later course of endotoxemia.
Although down-regulation of Arap1 during endotoxemia
appears to be relevant for the development of hypotension
and, by inference, hyporesponsiveness to angiotensin II, it
should be noted that other mechanisms, such as inade￾quate formation of vasodilator agents and resistance to
other vasoconstrictors, are relevant in the pathogenesis of
septic circulatory failure [1]. The contribution of these sin￾gle mechanisms to the overall dysregulation of vascular
tone may vary during the course of the disease.
Experiments in isolated perfused kidneys, used as a
model of organ vascular resistance, revealed that the sensi￾tivity of vascular AT1 receptors to angiotensin II was
reduced in the Arap1-/- kidneys, which is consistent with
previous in vitro data indicating that Arap1 enhances the
membrane surface expression of the AT1 receptor [17,26].
The basal renal vascular resistance, that is, in the absence
of angiotensin II, was indistinguishable between the iso￾lated kidneys from the Arap1-/- and the wildtype mice,
indicating that the angiotensin II-independent compo￾nents of the vascular tone were unaltered in Arap1-defi￾cient kidneys. The dose-response curve of vascular
resistance vs. angiotensin II concentration in the isolated
perfused kidney closely mimics the in vivo situation. Thus,
the steepest slope of the dose-response curve was observed
in the angiotensin II concentration range of 30 to 100 pM,
similar to concentrations in vivo, which have been
estimated to be in the range of 50 to 100 pM for the
mouse [27].
Despite the different vascular AT1 receptor sensitiv￾ities in the Arap1-/- and wildtype mice in vitro, the
baseline blood pressure in the Arap1-/- mice was incon￾spicuous, suggesting that corresponding changes in sys￾temic vasopressor systems compensated for the
deviation of vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II. In fact,
the PRC was increased by 60% in the Arap1-/- mice
compared with that in the wildtype mice, which appar￾ently allowed for full restoration of the total vascular
resistance to wildtype levels, at least under baseline con￾ditions. When the Arap1-/- mice were treated with an
ACE inhibitor, the systolic blood pressure decreased to
a larger extent than in the wildtype mice, suggesting
again that blood pressure maintenance in the Arap1-/-
mice requires an activated RAS. A compensatory stimu￾lation of RAS has been shown for several models of
compromised AT1 receptor function, such as AT1a,b
receptor-deficient mice [28]. In the situation of complete
AT1 deficiency, the basal PRC is elevated 6- to 10-fold
compared with that in control animals; this increase in
PRC has been attributed to a disinhibition of renin
secretion because of an interruption of the direct nega￾tive feedback loop of angiotensin II on the renin-secret￾ing cells and to systemic effects, such as low arterial
pressure. Activation of the RAS in the Arap1-/- mice,
however, appears to be related to the systemic rather
than direct effects of angiotensin II on renin-producing
cells because the relative suppression of renin secretion
by angiotensin II was preserved in the isolated perfused
mouse model. These functional data are consistent with
the results of a recent localization study that suggested
that renin-producing cells of the afferent arterioles do
not express Arap1 [18].
Conclusion
Septic patients frequently suffer from compromised sensi￾tivity of the vasculature to pressor hormones, such as
angiotensin II. Our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that
Arap1 acts as a positive modulator of vascular AT1 recep￾tors. During endotoxemia, Arap1 expression is markedly
down-regulated and sepsis-induced circulatory failure is
aggravated in Arap1-deficient mice. Loss of Arap1 func￾tion during endotoxemia therefore may contribute to the
vascular hyporeactivity to angiotensin II in septic patients.
Key messages
• Septic patients frequently suffer from compromised
sensitivity of the vasculature to pressor hormones,
such as angiotensin II.
• The AT1 receptor-associated protein Arap1

• In endotoxemia, Arap1 expression is markedly
down-regulated.
• Arap1 deficiency aggravates sepsis-induced circula￾tory failure.
• Down-regulation of Arap1 during endotoxemia may
contribute to vascular hyporeactivity to angiotensin II
during endotoxemia.
