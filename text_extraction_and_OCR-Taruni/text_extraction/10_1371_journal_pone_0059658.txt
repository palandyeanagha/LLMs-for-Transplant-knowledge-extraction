Abstract
The aim of the present work was to test the potential of Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR￾ToF-MS) in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and the assessment of disease severity by direct analysis of exhaled breath.
Twenty-six volunteers have been enrolled in this study: 12 patients (M/F 8/4, mean age 70.5 years, min-max 42–80 years)
with liver cirrhosis of different etiologies and at different severity of disease and 14 healthy subjects (M/F 5/9, mean age 52.3
years, min-max 35–77 years). Real time breath analysis was performed on fasting subjects using a buffered end-tidal on-line
sampler directly coupled to a PTR-ToF-MS. Twelve volatile organic compounds (VOCs) resulted significantly differently in
cirrhotic patients (CP) compared to healthy controls (CTRL): four ketones (2-butanone, 2- or 3- pentanone, C8-ketone, C9-
ketone), two terpenes (monoterpene, monoterpene related), four sulphur or nitrogen compounds (sulfoxide-compound, S￾compound, NS-compound, N-compound) and two alcohols (heptadienol, methanol). Seven VOCs (2-butanone, C8-ketone, a
monoterpene, 2,4-heptadienol and three compounds containing N, S or NS) resulted significantly differently in compensate
cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh A; CP-A) and decompensated cirrhotic subjects (Child-Pugh B+C; CP-B+C). ROC (Receiver
Operating Characteristic) analysis was performed considering three contrast groups: CP vs CTRL, CP-A vs CTRL and CP-A vs
CP-B+C. In these comparisons monoterpene and N-compound showed the best diagnostic performance.
Conclusions: Breath analysis by PTR-ToF-MS was able to distinguish cirrhotic patients from healthy subjects and to
discriminate those with well compensated liver disease from those at more advanced severity stage. A breath-print of liver
cirrhosis was assessed for the first time.

Introduction
Smelling the exhaled breath of patient is an ancient approach of
expert clinicians to recognize some illnesses since the times of
Hippocrates, who first described fetor oris and fetor hepaticus in his
treatise on breath odour and disease. In particular, the sweet smell
of acetone in human breath is associated to uncontrolled diabetes,
while the fishy and urine-like smells are due to liver disease and
kidney failure, respectively [1–3].
Liver plays a key role in metabolism and, even in the early
stages of chronic liver damage, a metabolic impairment can be
usually evidenced leading to the over-production of various
endogenous compounds which concentrate in the blood and, if
volatiles, are present in the exhaled breath. This is the premise to
perform a non invasive diagnosis with breath analysis [4].
However, only in the last few decades this approach was made
possible due to the development of a sensitive gas-chromato￾graphic and mass-spectrometric instruments able to measure
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) with sufficient accuracy and
sensitivity [5].
Up to now, the clinical utility of breath analysis was evaluated
for different diseases as, for instance, the monitoring of diabetes
mellitus and in the screening for lung and colorectal cancer
[1,6,7]. Very few information are available about its possible use in
patients with liver cirrhosis [1].
Among the different methods for breath analysis, direct
injection mass spectrometry [8] has many advantages as previously
highlighted [9]. Summarizing: it is a completely non-invasive
approach; it does not need the administration of drugs or marker
compounds, as in the classical ‘‘breath test’’ [10]; it can be
performed in real-time without breath sample pre treatment. A
particular advantage of our method, in comparison to other recent
approaches in gastrointestinal disease [7], is the immediate
availability of the results at the time of the sampling, the easy
application, the low risk of artifacts and the abolition of procedural
steps related to the filling of bag, the adsorption of VOCs on to
sorbent cartridge, the desorption of VOCs and finally the

possibility to separate the breath inhaled fraction (environmental
contaminants) from the end-tidal breath.
Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) [11] is
a particular implementation of direct injection mass spectrometry
characterized by very low detection limits and by a soft chemical
ionization often producing the molecular ion only. While most
implementation of PTR-MS so far were based on a quadrupole
mass analyzer, recently a new version implementing a Time-of￾Flight mass analyzer has been realized (PTR-ToF-MS) [12]. This
new version is characterized by a wider mass range and a better
time resolution (one spectrum in a split second), respect to the
previous ones. Moreover the good mass resolution and accuracy
allowing molecular formula identification. PTR-ToF-MS has been
recently applied for breath analysis of humans [13] and animal
models [14].
This work aimed to evaluate whether breath analysis by PTR￾ToF-MS can be used for a rapid, direct and non invasive diagnosis
of liver cirrhosis, as well as for the assessment of disease severity.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects and Treatment
The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of
the University of Naples ‘‘Federico II’’ and all participants signed
the informed consent before the enrolment. Twelve patients (M/F
8/4, mean age 70.5, 42–80 years) with liver cirrhosis of different
etiology and status and 14 healthy subjects (M/F 5/9, mean age
52.3, 35–77 years) were enrolled in the study. The principal
characteristics of patients and controls are reported in Table 1.
All subjects were Caucasian. The diagnosis in patients with
cirrhosis was previously formulated on the basis of clinical
ultrasonographic and biochemical parameters. The etiology of
cirrhosis was viral in 9 patients (8 HCV and 1 HBV) and
metabolic in 3 patients. The Child-Pugh class of subjects in the
patients group was A in 6, B in 3 and C class in 3.
The Child-Pugh is a score routinely used in hepatology to assess
stage and prognosis of cirrhosis; it is based on functional tests
(bilirubin, INR or prothrombin activity, albumin) and two clinical
parameters: Portal-Systemic Encephalopathy (EPS) and ascites.
The Child-Pugh score can range from class A (well compensated
liver cirrhosis) to class C (end stage cirrhosis). No patients had a
history of surgical shunt or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt, severe chronic cholestasis, diabetes mellitus, neoplasia,
kidney failure, or recent weight reduction.
Breath sampling was carried out in the morning from fasting
subjects. Participants were also asked to refrain, since the evening
before the measurement, from smoking, chewing gum, using
mouthwash, brushing teeth, drinking alcohol and coffee and
consuming foods containing garlic, onion, mint and similar
flavored meals. To this purpose a standardized dinner was
consumed the evening before the sampling including a serving
of fish or white meat, steamed vegetables, white bread, apple or
pear. Physical exercises were also avoided over the 24 hours before
measurements. Participants in the study were subjected to a
dietary questionnaire to assess their eating habits and food eaten in
the days before the measurement of breath. Each subject was
asked to indicate the average portion and the frequency of intake
of over 60 foods belonging to the following groups: milk and dairy
products, fish, meat and eggs, meats, cereals and cereal products,
fruits and vegetables, snacks and soft drinks and alcohol. The food
questionnaires were compiled with the help of photographs and
images to calculate the average portion taken. The food
questionnaires were drawn up subsequently by a software that
can make a semi-quantitative assessment of the diet.
Breath Sampling and PTR-ToF-MS
Real time breath analysis was performed using a buffered end￾tidal (BET) on-line sampler [15] coupled to a Proton Transfer
Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS,
Ionicon Analytik - Austria). Subject is sitting in front of the
interface and asked to breath normally room air. After a short
time, the operator asks the subject to give a single exhalation in a
disposable mouthpiece, provided with a sputum trap, connected to
the BET system. The BET system allows the collection of the last
40 ml of exhaled breath gas known as end-tidal fraction. This
fraction is the richest in those molecules derived from exchange at
the alveolar-capillary membrane and less affected by inhaled
breath air gas. Furthermore the use of BET system avoids the
effect of hyperventilation on volatile concentration. The fraction of
exhaled gas collected through the BET system is drawn directly to
the drift tube of a PTR-ToF-MS used as on-line detection and
recording system of the volatile organic compounds spectra.
Data Analysis and Statistics
Spectra were acquired using the data acquisition software TOF￾DAQ (Tofwerk AG, Switzerland) with a mass range of 10–400 Th
and stored in HDF5 format for efficient data storage and direct
access to data structure and considered for data analysis.
Signal distortions caused by the detector dead time were
corrected before mass calibration, peak detection and area
extraction, which were performed according to the procedure
described in [16] using a cumulative peak fitting [17]. Internal
calibration was based on three peaks always present in the PTR￾MS spectra at m/z = 21.0221 (H3
18O+
), 29.9974 (NO+
) and
59.0491 (protonated acetone: C3H7O+
). Throughout the article,
we use 3 decimal figures for estimated m/z values and 4 for the
expected exact ones.
Peak intensity in part per billion (ppbv) was estimated by the
formula described in Lindinger et al. [18] using a constant value
for the reaction rate constant (k = 2.1029 cm3 s
21
). This introduces
a systematic error for the absolute concentration for each
compound that is in most cases below 30% and could be
accounted for if the actual rate constant is available [19].
Exploratory examinations of the clinical data involved the
calculation of descriptive statistics (as appropriate, the mean,
median, standard deviation (SD), proportion and 95% confidence
interval were computed). Continuous quantitative breath data,
being not normally distributed, were summarized with their
median and median absolute deviation. Comparison of continuous
variables was performed with Mann–Whitney U test analysis. A
significant level of p,0.05 was chosen. A typical PTR-ToF-MS
spectrum contains hundreds of peaks even in the case of breath
analysis. This has been considered in the case of multiple
comparison by applying the false discovery rate control [20].
To highlight possible relationship between VOCs and bio￾chemical parameters in patients with cirrhosis the Pearson’s
correlation was measured. Not normally distributed variables were
transformed according to the Box-Cox method [21].
ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were used to
calculate the performance of diagnostic procedures and for
calculating the best point of separation between sensitivity and
specificity of each of them. Sensitivity and specificity were
calculated according to Sackett [22]. Given the small sample size
and to reduce the possible beta error, a p value lower than 0.10 was
considered significant and clinically valuable. Data were analysed
using the Statistica 9.1 (StatSoft, USA) software.

Results
VOCs Identification
The analysis of the acquired spectra allowed the extraction of
285 mass peaks 51 of them being significantly different (p,0.05) in
cirrhotic patients (CP) compared to healthy controls (CTRL). The
false discovery rate method has been used to take into account the
multiple comparisons and provided a selection of twenty-six peaks,
related to 12 compounds. The list of measured and theoretical
monoisotopic masses detected, the corresponding mass errors, the
corresponding VOC identified by the sum formula of each
monoisotopic peak and, in some cases, by fragmentation
comparison, are reported in Table 2 (Figure S1).
The identified VOCs could be grouped in the chemical classes
of alcohol (heptanedienol and methanol), ketons (2-butanone, 2- or
3-pentanone, and other two VOCs, most probably 2-octanone, i.e.
C8-ketone; and 2-nonanone, i.e. C9-ketone), terpenes (monoter￾pene tentatively identified as limonene, and a terpene related
compound tentatively identified as p-cymene), sulphur and
nitrogen (Sulfoxide compound, S-compound, NS- and N-com￾pound) compounds.
VOCs Quantification
Table 3 shows the median concentration of the identified
VOCs in the whole group of cirrhotic patients (CP) and in healthy
controls (CTRL) as well as in the subgroups of CP classified as
Child-Pugh A (CP-A) and Child-Pugh B+C (CP-B+C). No
difference in the spectrum of VOCs has been observed in relation
to age. All, but S-compound, have a higher concentration in CP
breath than in CTRL one. Further analysis on patient subgroups
showed that no difference in VOC concentration was in CP-A vs
CTRL, but for N-compound.
Otherwise, seven VOCs had a different concentration in CP-A
vs CP-B+C; specifically, five VOCs were at higher concentration
(2-butanone, C8-ketone, monoterpene, NS-compound, heptadie￾nol) and two were at lower concentration (S-compound, N￾compound) in the breath of CP-B+C compared to CP-A. Eleven
compounds (all but N-compound) showed significantly different
concentration in CTRL vs CP-B+C (Table S1).
VOCs Correlation with Liver Function Test
As reported in Table 4 significant correlation between the 12
identified VOCs and biochemical parameters of liver function was
found. Serum bilirubin showed a positive correlation with 6
VOCs: monoterpene, methanol, 2-butanone, heptadienol, C8-
ketone, terpene related. The highest correlation was found for the
C8-ketone. Figure 1 shows the correlation between serum
bilirubin and C8-Ketone (panel a) and the distribution of the
C8-ketone breath concentrations in CTRL and the 3 classes of CP
(panel b). Prothrombin activity is negatively correlated to the
monoterpene and the C8-ketone. These correlations were also
confirmed by Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient (data not
shown) [23]. No significant correlation was found between serum
albumin level and the 12 VOCs identified.
ROC Analysis
To evaluate whether individual VOCs or an appropriate
combination of them can discriminate among groups, ROC
analysis was performed.
The performance of a test to separate patients with (sensitivity)
and without (specificity) a specific disease is graphically expressed

by the ROC curve. The area under the curve allows a comparison
of the diagnostic performance of different tests: the greater is the
area under the curve, the better is the ability to separate the two
groups of patients.
Three contrast groups were considered, i.e. CP vs CTRL, CP-A
vs CTRL and CP-A vs CP-B+C. The area under curve (AUC) of
VOCs with the highest diagnostic performance (p value,0.10) and
the coordinate of the ROC curve with the best value able to
separate the compared groups are summarized in Table 5. Given
the higher p-value used in this analysis we considered also
dimethyl sulphide that did not meet the false discovery rate
criterion.
Eleven VOCs (all but NS-compound), have a good diagnostic
performance to discriminate CP vs CTRL. In this comparison the
monoterpene related peak was the one with the highest diagnostic
performance. Using the best cut-off of separation (2.16 ppbv) the
sensitivity and specificity were respectively of 83% and 86%, as
shown in Figure 2.
Four VOCs (C9-ketone, monoterpene, N-compound, dimethyl
sulphide) have a good diagnostic performance to discriminate CP￾A vs CTRL. In this comparison the N-compound was the VOC
with the highest diagnostic performance. Using the best cut-off of
separation (0.26 ppbv) the sensitivity and specificity were respec￾tively of 83% and 86%.
Eight peaks (2-butanone, 2- or 3-pentanone, C8-ketone,
monoterpene, S-compound, NS-compound, N-compound, hepta￾dienol) have a good diagnostic performance to discriminate CP-A
vs CP-B+C. In this comparison again the monoterpene related
peak was the one with the highest diagnostic performance. Using
the best cut-off of separation (6.7 ppbv) the sensitivity and
specificity were always 100%.
Discussion
In this study PTR-ToF-MS was used for the first time to analyze
exhaled breath of patients with liver cirrhosis aiming at verifying
its applicability as non-invasive tool for diagnosis of cirrhosis.
Twelve different VOCs, including ketones (2-butanone, 2-or 3-
pentanone, C8-ketone, C9-ketone), terpenes (monoterpene, ter￾pene related), S and N containing compounds (Sulfoxide￾compound, S-compound, NS-compound, N-compound) and
alcohols (heptadienol, methanol) were significantly different
between cirrhotic and healthy subjects.
The only previous work on this topic, investigating molecules
responsible of fetor hepaticus [1] examined the breath of cirrhotic
patients by GC-MS combined with thermal desorption. Authors
identified four VOCs (three ketones: acetone, 2 pentanone, 2-
butanone and one sulphur compound: dimethyl sulphide) being at
higher concentration in cirrhotics’ breath than in controls’ one [1].
Interestingly, the chemical classes of discriminating VOCs found
in our study (ketones and sulphur compounds) were the same, and
the PTR-ToF-MS attained a more complete picture of the breath
compounds also allowing to distinguish patients according to
disease severity. Seven VOCs have different concentrations among
groups being significantly more (2-butanone, C8-ketone, mono￾terpene, NS-compound and heptadienol) and less (S-compound
and N-compound) abundant in patients with advanced disease
(Child B and C patients) compared to those with compensated
cirrhosis (Child A patients). Although in this last comparison the
small sample did not allow definitive statements, however, we have
reported the result as the trend was preserved.
The increased concentration of ketones in exhaled breath of
patients with advanced cirrhosis might be dependent from
increased insulin resistance and from a different metabolic
response to fasting in patients with advanced cirrhosis vs those
with compensated disease [22]. In fact, insulin resistance, that
usually increase in patients with end stage liver disease [24,25],
favored the lipolysis and free fatty acids b-oxidation led to the
formation of ketones [26]. This hypothesis is further supported by
the direct correlation between the levels of C8-ketone, present in
the breath, and serum levels of bilirubin, as well as with the Child
–Pugh stage of cirrhosis. On the other hand, the hypothesis that
response to fasting might have a role in discriminating breath
composition depending on liver disease severity is also consistent
with data reported by Van der Velde and co-workers [1] who
analyzed breath of subjects 30 minutes from food intake (a time
that might be too short to modify concentration of ketones from
previous fasting) and with the observation by Mathews and co￾workers [27] that a reduced of CYP2E1 enzyme activity (as in liver
disease) increased breath ketones in rats.
The peak at m/z 137.137, is a terpene-related peak tentatively
identified as limonene. It was 15 folds more abundant in CP than
in CTRL and ROC analysis even assigned to this feature a

prognostic significance for liver disease. This evidence can be
explained by the diet composition or by the lacking efficacy of liver
metabolism leading to a higher concentration of terpenes in
cirrhotic patients than in healthy subjects.
In a previous work, the high concentration of limonene in the
lung air of 37% (9 out 24) of patients with liver disease was
suggested to be dependent from the frequency of fruit juice
consumption [28]. However, this possibility was ruled out in the
present study since breath limonene did not correlate with citrus
product consumption (as recorded by a food frequency question￾naire relative to the week before breath sampling). Moreover, none
of the drugs used by subjects could originate terpenes neither
directly or indirectly by affecting isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.
Since metabolism of limonene includes a first step in the liver [29],
where it may be transformed in carveol metabolites or perillyl
metabolites by CYP2C enzymes [30], it has been hypothesized
that a deficient liver metabolism, in end-stage disease, may
determine a reduction of limonene biotransformation and its
accumulation in the original form with a consequent retard of
excretion and a high abundance in the exhaled breath.
The increased concentration of some sulphur containing
compounds, in CPs’ breath was consistent with the well known

incomplete metabolism of sulphur containing amino acids typical
of liver disease [1,31,32].
The production of various nitrogen species increases during
oxidative stress and nitrogen compounds are considered a
good markers of oxidative damage [33]. In liver injury, the
concentration of nitrogen compounds, such as ammonia, in￾creased in the blood when the removal of ammonia through the
conversion to urea is limited due to the impairment of liver
function [34].
The increased methanol in human breath was already
observed by other authors and it was related to pectin degradation
and explained with a different amount of fruit intake by cirrhotic
patients [35]. However, also in this case the dietary intake analysis
demonstrated no differences in fruit consumption between CTRL
and CP, thus the different methanol breath amounts in the two
groups, might be due to other reasons. The imbalance of
microflora composition found in cirrhotic patients [36], could
account for a different colon fermentation activity and, in turn, for
the different concentration of methanol in the breath.
Furthermore, some VOCs, such as monoterpene and C8-
ketone, show a good correlation with liver function test; in
particular they show a direct correlation with bilirubin serum
levels and an inverse correlation with blood prothrombin activity.
These results suggest that the VOCs breath concentration may be
a direct marker of liver disease severity and, as a consequence, an
important clinical parameter. In contrast, no significant correla￾tion was found between the levels of albumin and the 12 VOCs
identified. This is probably due to the little variability of serum
albumin concentration in our population.
Finally, the diagnostic performance of the breath analysis was
evaluated by ROC analysis. Data confirmed that monoterpenes
concentration could be a good parameter to distinguish both
cirrhotic patients from healthy subjects (with sensitivity and
specificity of 83% and 86%) and advanced cirrhosis from early￾stage cirrhosis (sensitivity and specificity of 100%). On the other
hand, the N-compound seems to be able to distinguish between
patients with well compensated liver cirrhosis and controls subjects
whit a sensibility and specificity of 83%.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
using analysis of VOCs by direct injection mass spectrometry, and
PTR-ToF-MS in particular, in the exhaled breath of cirrhotic
patients. The PTR-ToF-MS breath-print of liver cirrhosis allowed
to distinguish cirrhotic patients from healthy subjects and well
compensated liver disease from more advanced liver stage. The
breath analysis carried out with PTR-ToF-MS is a non-invasive
and rapid method that allows to have a result at the time of
sampling. The breath analysis can also be applied to patients who
are unable to perform blood sampling and it is a tool of paramount

relevance in the health service plan constantly searching for
methods easy to perform and engendering high patients compli￾ance. Our findings strongly support the availability in the near
future of high throughput effective, easy, direct, and reliable
method for the screening of cirrhosis.
The extensive applicability of this methodology suggest that
breath analysis by PTR-ToF-MS can be a breakthrough
innovative tool in diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of
liver diseases.
