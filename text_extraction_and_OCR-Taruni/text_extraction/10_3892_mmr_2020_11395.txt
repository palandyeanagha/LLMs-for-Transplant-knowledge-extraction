Abstract. Intestinal malrotation in newborns often requires 
urgent surgical treatment, especially in the presence of volvulus. 
Therefore, early‑stage diagnosis is critical. In the present 
study, differentially expressed plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) 
were screened for in patients with intestinal malrotation using 
high‑throughput Illumina sequencing, and validated using 
reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate 
their specificity, sensitivity and assess their diagnostic value for 
intestinal malrotation. Bioinformatics analysis was performed 
to investigate the functions associated with the dysregulated 
miRNAs. A profile consisting of 28 differentially expressed 
plasma miRNAs was obtained, of which nine were verified to 
exhibit significantly altered expression. According to a ROC anal￾ysis, four of these could represent novel early‑stage, non‑invasive 
biomarkers for intestinal malrotation. Bioinformatics analysis 
demonstrated that the differentially expressed miRNAs were 
predominantly involved in ‘metal ion transmembrane trans￾porter activity’ and ‘calcium‑dependent protein binding’, which 
may be related to the ‘endocytosis’ pathway. In conclusion, 
significantly differentially expressed plasma miRNAs were 
identified in congenital intestinal malrotation and their potential 
roles were described. These differentially expressed miRNAs 
may serve as biomarkers of intestinal malrotation and improve 
early diagnosis for this condition.
Introduction
Intestinal malrotation is a congenital aberrant positioning of 
the bowel that is usually accompanied with anomalous bowel 
fixation through mesenteric bands or a lack of fixation in parts 
of the bowel (1). Intestinal malrotation was first described by 
William Ladd in 1936 and later classified as non‑rotation, 
mixed or incomplete rotation, reversed rotation, or mesocolic 
hernia (2,3). Typically, ≤ one in 200 newborns are estimated 
to have asymptomatic rotational anomaly (3,4). Symptomatic 
malrotation affects 1 in 6,000 live births and often occurs in the 
first few weeks of life, resulting in elevated risk of bowel obstruc￾tion, midgut volvulus and necrosis in the bowel (3,5,6). Currently, 
upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series is the preferred imaging 
technique for malrotation diagnosis. Nevertheless, both false 
positive and false negative interpretations occur, with reported 
false positive rates of ≤15% (1,7,8). When the duodenojejunal 
junction position is ambiguous based on UGI series, further 
examination is necessary. A barium enema might prove helpful 
in such cases; however, the first pass of barium through the 
duodenum is often overlooked (9). The duodenal anatomy is hard 
to recognize with inadequate amounts of barium, while excessive 
barium could cause rapid and uncontrolled passage of barium 
through the duodenum or vague visualization. Moreover, the use 
of sonography in malrotation diagnosis often requires the opinion 
of experienced radiologists, who may not always available at most 
centers (10,11). Therefore, the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation 
is often an intricate and complex process, and a more effective 
and ideally non‑invasive diagnostic method is needed (6,11,12).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of non‑coding 
RNA molecules, usually 19‑25 nucleotides long, which are 
abundantly and stably expressed in plasma and other bodily 
fluids (13,14). Differential expression of specific miRNAs has 
been identified in numerous diseases, and an increasing body 
of evidence indicates that miRNAs could serve as promising 
biomarkers for diagnostic use (15‑17). For example, previous 
studies have identified miRNAs associated with various types 
of cancer, highlighting an opportunity to use these circulating 
disease‑related miRNAs as biomarkers (18,19). In cardiovas￾cular diseases, it was demonstrated that the combined use of 
multiple miRNAs could improve the predictive efficiency of 
traditional diagnostic methods (20,21). Thus, understanding 
the potential role of miRNAs in intestinal malrotation

may provide invaluable insight into improved diagnostic 
approaches, as demonstrated in other diseases (22‑24).
Previously, a mutation in the forkhead box F1 gene was 
demonstrated to be associated with intestinal malrotation (25). 
However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have 
evaluated epigenetic changes during the pathogenesis of intes￾tinal malrotation (26). In the present study, it was hypothesized 
that the expression of specific miRNAs might be dysregulated 
in newborns with intestinal malrotation. Thus, the aim of the 
present study was to determine whether such differentially 
expressed miRNAs could be used for improved diagnosis of 
intestinal malrotation.
Materials and methods
Study design and sample collection. Ten children with intes￾tinal malrotation (age range, 5 days to month) and ten sex‑ and 
age‑matched controls (age range, 4 days to 1 month) admitted 
to The Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University 
(Nanjing, China) between February 2018 and July 2019 
were enrolled in the present study, and their plasma samples 
were collected prospectively. Children with immunological 
disorders, cardiovascular diseases and other congenital diges￾tive tract abnormalities were excluded, as these pathological 
factors can affect serum miRNA levels. Plasma samples were 
collected in a plasma separator tube prior to any treatment 
and stored at ‑80˚C until use. The study was approved by the 
Institutional Ethics Committee of The Children's Hospital of 
Nanjing Medical University (approval no. 201701025). Written 
informed consent was obtained from a parent of each patient.
RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from plasma 
samples using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In 
addition, 5 µl of 200 nM cel‑miR‑39 (Guangzhou RiboBio 
Co., Ltd.) was added to each sample to serve as an external 
control (27). RNA concentration and quality was assessed 
using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Inc.). RNA was stored at ‑80˚C until use.
Illumina HiSeq sequencing. A total of six plasma samples 
(three patients with intestinal malrotation and three controls) 
were used for sequencing. miRNA‑seq library was constructed 
using NEBNext Small RNA kit (NEB, cat. no. E7300S). DNA 
integrity was measure using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with 
the Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; cat. 
no. 5067‑1504). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina 
HiseqX platform (Illumina, Inc.; 150 cycles; paired‑end). HiSeq 
X Ten Reagent kit v2.5 (Illumina, Inc.; cat. no. FC‑501‑25) 
was used for sequencing. The concentration of DNA was 
30‑40 nM, which was measured by real‑time PCR. Ligation 
of 5' and 3' adaptors was carried out following manufacturer's 
instructions. Small RNAs were amplified by PCR (17 cycles) 
using adaptor‑specific primers according to the manufacturer's 
protocol The PCR products (fragments of ~90 bp) were purified 
by 8% PAGE. The size distribution of molecules in each sample 
were evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Subsequently, 
amplification of the eligible RNAs was conducted to generate 
the cluster on the flow cell, which was then sequenced using 
the HiSeq 2000 System (single end; Illumina, Inc.), following 
the manufacturer's instructions. miRNAs were considered 
to be significantly differentially expressed if P<0.05 and log2
(fold‑change) ≥8 for upregulated miRNAs, or log2 (fold‑change) 
≤‑8 for downregulated miRNAs in the intestinal malrotation 
group, compared with the control group. These criteria applied 
to the average of the three samples.
Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. GO func￾tional enrichment analysis (http://geneontology.org/docs/
go‑enrichment‑analysis/) and KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) of DEGs 
were performed using DIANA TOOLS MirPath version 3 
(http://diana.imis.athena‑innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php). 
GO has three functional categories: Molecular function (MF); 
biological process (BP); and cellular component (CC). P<0.05 
was considered as a statistically significant difference.
Quantification of plasma miRNA levels using reverse tran￾scription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). Total RNA extracted 
from 20 plasma samples (10 patients with intestinal malrota￾tion and 10 controls) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using 
the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc.), according 
to the manufacturer's instructions. RT‑qPCRs were carried out 
using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) 
on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics) to measure miRNA
expression levels. A total of 18 miRNA candidates (15 upregu￾lated and three downregulated miRNAs in intestinal malrotation) 
were selected for RT‑qPCR analysis. Thermocycling condi￾tions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95˚C for 10 min, 
followed by 40 cycles at 94˚C for 15 sec and 60˚C for 1 min. 
Relative expression values were normalized against the spike‑in 
cel‑miR‑39 and analyzed using the 2‑ΔΔCq
 method (28).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out 
using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and 
SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp.). A two‑sided unpaired t‑test was used 
to compare differences in miRNA expression between the 
control and intestinal malrotation groups. Receiver operating 
curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the area 
under the curve (AUC) of miRNA expression. SPSS 23.0 
(IBM Corp.) was used to construct and analyze the curves. 
The final results were illustrated using GraphPad Prism 8.0 
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). P<0.05 was considered to indicate 
a statistically significant difference.
Results
Identification of differentially expressed serum miRNAs in 
intestinal malrotation. Serum miRNA levels were measured in 
six plasma samples (three patients with intestinal malrotation 
and three controls) using high‑throughput sequencing. Overall, 
~2,588 miRNAs were identified. The profiles of differentially 
expressed plasma miRNAs are presented as a heat map and a 
volcano plot in Fig. 1. Both the heat map and volcano plot show 
that patients with intestinal malrotation and healthy controls 
displayed markedly different plasma miRNA profiles. A total 
of 28 miRNAs exhibited significant differential expression, of 
which 21 were upregulated and 7 down regulated in patients 
with IM, compared with controls (Table I).

Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. GO
analysis suggested that the differentially expressed miRNAs 
were mainly involved in involved in ‘skeletal system devel￾opment’, ‘axon development’ (Fig. 2A, Table II). These 
miRNAs were mainly localized or exerted their functions 
in dendrites and the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2A, Table III). 
Moreover, these miRNAs were involved in ‘metal ion 
transmembrane transporter activity’, ‘channel activity’ and 
‘substrate‑specific channel activity’ and other molecular 
functions (Fig. 2A; Table IV).
KEGG pathway analysis identified 58 significantly enriched 
pathways in the sequenced miRNAs. The 10 most enriched 
pathway terms were ‘PI3K‑Akt signaling pathway’, ‘human 
papillomavirus infection’, ‘MAPK signaling pathway’, ‘endocy￾tosis’, ‘Cushing syndrome’, ‘gastric cancer’, ‘estrogen signaling 
pathway’, ‘AGE‑RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic compli￾cations’, ‘galactose metabolism’ and ‘vitamin digestion and 
absorption’ (Fig. 2B). The most significant KEGG pathway was 
‘Endocytosis’ (KEGG ID, hsa04144), which involved 51 target 
genes (P=001; Table V). The network associated was analyzed, 
which demonstrated TGF‑β signaling pathway and endosomal 
recycling compartment were mainly affected (Fig. 3). Thus, GO 
and KEGG analysis provided novel insights into the underlying 
mechanism by which plasma miRNAs might participate in the 
pathogenesis of intestinal malrotation.
Selection and validation of potential plasma miRNA 
biomarkers for intestinal malrotation. A total of 18 miRNAs 
were differentially expressed. Of these, 15 miRNAs were 
upregulated, including, hsa‑miR‑1914‑3p, miR‑6763‑5p, 
miR‑185‑3p, miR‑4738‑3p, miR‑3131, miR‑6797‑5p, 
miR‑6740‑5p, miR‑412‑5p, miR‑6758‑5p, miR‑6862‑5p, 
miR‑365a‑5p, miR‑197‑5p, miR‑6877‑5p, let‑7 and miR‑7976. 
Moreover, three were downregulated, hsa‑miR‑194‑5p, 
‑144‑3p and ‑93‑5p (Table I) and were selected for further 
validation. The expression levels of all 18 candidates were 
measured in a larger sample size (10 patients with intestinal 
malrotation and 10 controls) by RT‑qPCR. In total, nine 
miRNAs were confirmed to be differentially expressed. 
Of these, six were upregulated, compared with the control 
group, including hsa‑miR‑1914‑3p, ‑6763‑5p, ‑185‑3p, ‑3131,

Discussion
Malrotation is a congenital abnormal bowel position within the 
peritoneal cavity that usually involves both the small and the 
large bowel (29). The term malrotation encompasses a wide 
range of rotational and fixation abnormalities of the intestines, 
from readily apparent omphaloceles in newborns to asymptom￾atic non‑rotation in adults (1). Congenital intestinal non‑rotation 
and incomplete rotation usually concur with a narrow base of the 
mesentery, which might cause duodenal obstruction and midgut 
volvulus and manifest as acute symptoms(30). Pediatric patients 
who do not present acute symptoms but are not diagnosed before

adulthood are at risk of developing various chronic symptoms 
later in life, including vomiting, vague abdominal pain, diar￾rhea, nausea, early satiety and bloating, dyspepsia and other 
functional or psychiatric disorders (31,32).
Approximately 90% of infants with intestinal malrotation 
are diagnosed within the first year of life, and ~80% within 
the first month (33). Common diagnostic tools include UGI, 
ultrasonography, and barium enema. Although the duode￾nojejunal junction is usually fixed at the Treitz ligament 
and functions as a useful landmark, in some cases UGI
results may be confusing or hard to interpret, and diagnosis 
of these cases of malrotation depends on the recognition 
of anatomic subtleties (8,34). Both false positive and false 
negative findings have been reported (7,8,35,36). Barium 
enema can help to some extent in some cases, but chal￾lenges exist in terms of the quantity of barium administered 
to children and the observation of the first pass of barium 
through the duodenum (5). Moreover, the interpretation of

In the present study, potential diagnostic biomarkers were 
identified by analyzing plasma miRNA levels in pediatric 
patients with intestinal malrotation. A profile of differentially 
expressed miRNAs in the plasma of intestinal malrotation 
patients was obtained by sequencing plasma miRNAs, and 
a number of differentially expressed miRNAs were identi￾fied, including 21 upregulated and seven downregulated 
miRNAs. Subsequently, bioinformatics analyses were carried 
out to investigate the potential involvement of differentially 
expressed miRNAs in intestinal malrotation.
GO enrichment analysis suggested that these miRNAs 
were mainly involved in 'metal ion transmembrane transporter 
activity’, ‘calcium‑dependent protein binding’, ‘cation channel 
activity’ and ‘phospholipid binding’. ‘Metal ion transmembrane 
transporter activity’ and ‘calcium‑dependent protein binding’ 
were the most significantly enriched GO terms with respect to 
molecular function. Interestingly, it was previously reported 
that calcium channel‑blocking drugs could lead to many 
developmental abnormalities in Xenopus embryos, including 
malrotation of the gut, possibly through dysregulation of calcium 
ion antagonism (37). However, the potential link between 
plasma miRNA levels and calcium ion antagonism in intestinal 
malrotation requires further study to determine where and how 
plasma miRNAs interfere with calcium ion. ‘Cornification’ 
was the most significantly enriched GO term with respect to 
biological processes, followed by ‘skeletal system development 
cornification’. A previous study reported a higher frequency 
of malformations in the skeleton system, including the facial 
skeleton, the small pelvis, and the upper and lower extremities, 
among pediatric patients with intestinal malrotation (38). The 
present results indicated that plasma miRNAs might play a role 
in this association. The most enriched KEGG pathway was 
‘endocytosis’, which is a critical process in the intestine that is 
responsible for the endocytic uptake of macromolecules from 
the gut lumen. For instance, but its role in intestinal malrotation 
has not yet been studied (39,40).
miRNAs have been demonstrated to play a variety of 
roles in numerous intestinal diseases and several could even 
function as biomarkers (41‑43). Another important finding 
of the present study was that plasma miRNAs have the 
potential to serve as circulating biomarkers for intestinal 
malrotation. Based on the sequencing data and validation by 
RT‑qPCR in a larger number of samples, nine miRNAs were 
differentially expressed, including six upregulated miRNAs 
(hsa‑miR‑1914‑3p, ‑6763‑5p, ‑185‑3p, ‑3131, ‑6740‑5p and 
‑6758‑5p) and three downregulated miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑194‑5p, 
‑144‑3p and ‑93‑5p). The highest AUCs were obtained for 
miR‑1914‑3p, ‑3131, ‑185‑3p and ‑6763‑5p, suggesting that 
these miRNAs may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for intes￾tinal malrotation. As a following step, studies with larger 
sample sizes are necessary to validate the present findings.
In conclusion, a profile of differentially expressed miRNAs 
in the plasma of patients with intestinal malrotation was iden￾tified, and the potential molecular functions associated with 
these miRNAs were described. Four of the nine confirmed 
differentially expressed miRNAs have the potential to 
improve early diagnosis of intestinal malrotation. However, 
these miRNAs exhibited relatively small 95% CIs, which is 
a great limitation to our study and requires further confirma￾tion in the future with much larger sample size. These results 
also suggested that plasma miRNAs play an important role 
in intestinal malrotation, although this hypothesis requires 
further investigation.
