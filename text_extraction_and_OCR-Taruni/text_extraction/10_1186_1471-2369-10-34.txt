Abstract
Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly being recognized as a predictor for
both end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease. The present study, conducted on
individuals from a community in Arita, Japan, was designed to evaluate biomarkers that can be used
to determine the associated factors for CKD.
Methods: This study involved 1554 individuals. Kidney function was evaluated in terms of the
creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which was determined using the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Low eGFR was defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min per
1.73 m2. The concentration of both urinary albumin and urinary type IV collagen were measured.
Results: In the younger participants (age, <65 years), the odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI])
of low eGFR was 1.17 (1.02 to 1.34) for each 1 year older age, 6.28 (1.41 to 28.03) for urinary
albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) over 17.9 mg/g and 9.43 (2.55 to 34.91) for hyperlipidemia. On the
other hand, among the elderly participants (age, ≥ 65 years), the odds ratio (95% CI) of low eGFR
was 2.97 (1.33 to 6.62) for gender, 1.62 (1.06 to 2.50) for hypertension and 1.97 (1.19 to 3.28) for
hyperlipidemia. Urinary type IV collagen creatinine ratio was not identified as an associated factor
for low eGFR.
Conclusion: In this present cross-sectional community-based study, ACR is associated with CKD,
which was defined as an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, in the younger participants but
not in the older participants.
Background
The frequency of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been
increasing rapidly not only in Japan but also worldwide
[1]. Several reports have shown that over the past 2 dec￾ades, the number of ESRD patients who require dialysis or
transplantation has more than doubled in Europe and the

United States during the past 2 decades [2-4]. Similarly, in
Japan, the number of ESRD patients has been increasing
continuously over the past 3 decades. In 2005, 36,063
ESRD patients (average age, 66 years) enrolled in a new
dialysis program [5]. The incidences of renal diseases,
especially chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD, are
increasing in an aging society, such as that in Japan [6].
CKD is an important risk factor not only for ESRD but also
for cardiovascular disease [7-9]; therefore, the care for the
individuals affected by CKD has become a matter of con￾cern. Further, there is an increased societal demand for the
identification of risk factors for CKD and for the develop￾ment of strategies for the prevention of CKD.
Study findings on the prevalence of CKD vary considera￾bly [10,11], and there are sparse data in this regard for Jap￾anese populations. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading
cause of CKD and ESRD, and urinary albumin was origi￾nally used as a biomarker for the detection of CKD in dia￾betic patients. In addition, the excretion of urinary type IV
collagen (U-Col4) increases in diabetic patients with albu￾minuria [12]. The severity of renal insufficiency increases
in elderly people; therefore, it is important to detect CKD
and initiate treatment for this disease as early as possible.
It is also necessary to assess renal dysfunction in elderly
patients and to evaluate its associated risk factors using
parameters such as urinary albumin and U-Col4 in nor￾mal and CKD-affected Japanese populations.
The present study was conducted in the town of Arita,
which is a rural area in Japan. We investigated the associ￾ation between renal function and the urinary excretion of
albumin and U-Col4 and other confounding factors. In
addition, we assessed the associated factors for low esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in different age
groups (aged <65 years and ≥ 65 years). This community￾based study investigates whether the urinary albumin cre￾atinine ratio (ACR) and U-Col4 creatinine ratio (U￾Col4CR) are associated factors for CKD in Japan.
Methods
Study sample and design
In 2002, an annual health examination was conducted in
the town of Arita in Japan to investigate the cause and to
find out early phase of lifestyle oriented disease. Arita-cho
is located in the west of Saga Prefecture on the island of
Kyushu in southern Japan. One of the main occupations
in this town is agriculture and pottery (Arita-yaki), which
is a popular industry in Japan.
The population of this town was approximately 9300, the
population of males and females was 48.0% and 52.0%,
respectively. We sent an official letter regarding an annual
health examination and this program for the resident aged
= 18 at first. We then sent a second letter of invitation for
the resident who had not rejected this program. Finally, a
total of 1564 people aged = 18 took part in the program
and agreed to join the study. Ten participants were
excluded from the present analysis due to incomplete
data. A total of 1554 people aged 20-92 years entered into
the final statistical analysis. There were 573 males (63.8 ±
14.2 years) and 981 females participants (62.6 ± 14.4
years).
This study is a community-based and baseline survey that
consisted of a self-administered questionnaire on lifestyle,
medical histories, anthropometrical measurements, and
collections of blood and urine specimens from the partic￾ipants.
Questionnaires
Participants used a self-report questionnaire to document
medical history and lifestyle. They answered whether they
had ever been diagnosed with any of the following: heart
disease, cerebral infarction, hypertension, renal disease,
diabetes mellitus, anemia, hepatic disease, hyperuricemia,
or hyperlipidemia. They answered alcohol intake (drinker
or non-drinker), smoking habit (smoker or non-smoker),
insufficient exercise, exercise habit (doing physical activity
with sweat or not), regular meal consumption and eating
speed (self-judgment as a normal speed eater or fast
eater). Changing of weight from 20 years old was defined
in two groups (not changed, changed; getting lighter or
heavier). Fatty meal was defined in two groups (excess,
not excess). Salty meal was classified into 3 groups (light,
moderate, and heavy).
Laboratory methods and estimation of the glomerular 
filtration rate
Blood was sampled from all the participants for the assess￾ment of laboratory parameters. Fresh serum samples were
analyzed. Serum creatinine (Cr) was measured using the
uncompensated rate Jaffe reaction and an
OLYMPUSAU5431 auto analyzer (Tokyo, Japan), and the
normal values were found to range from 0.8 to 1.3 mg/dL
and from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL for male and female, respec￾tively.
We then estimated the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by
using the new 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease (MDRD) equation as follows [13-15]:
Participants with decreased kidney function were defined
primarily by the presence of eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73
m2 using the simplified MDRD study equation. Individu￾als with decreased kidney function were classified further
according to the CKD staging suggested by the guidelines

tive (K/DOQI) [15]. Individuals with low eGFR (eGFR 15
to 59 mL/min per 1.73 m2) were considered to have CKD.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight
(in kg) by height squared (in m2). Abnormal BMI level
was set as ≥ 25 kg/m2 both in males and females. The gly￾cated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured by high
performance liquid chromatography, and the normal val￾ues were found to range from 4.3% to 5.8%. The serum
levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density
lipoprotein in (HDL) cholesterol were determined enzy￾matically. Abnormal values were set as a total cholesterol
level of >5.69 mmol/L (>220 mg/dL), a HDL cholesterol
level of <1.03 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL), and/or serum triglyc￾eride level of >1.69 mmol/L (>150 mg/dL). The serum
aspartate amino transferase (AST) level of >40 U/L,
alanine amino transferase (ALT) level of >40 U/L, and γ￾glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) level of >60 U/L was set as
abnormal in males and females. Systolic and diastolic
blood pressures were measured by using an automatic
oscillometric method (OMRON; HEM-780) in the sitting
position after at least 5 minutes rest. Measurement was
performed twice, with the mean value used for statistical
analysis. Abnormal values were defined as systolic blood
pressure level of ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure
level of ≥ 90 mm Hg.
Urine samples were collected from the participants at
their respective homes and transported to the laboratory.
Proteinuria was defined as positive dipstick result by using
Uro-Paper II EIKEN (Eiken-Chemical, Tokyo, Japan).
First, the urinary Cr concentration was measured by per￾forming an enzymatic method (Shino-Test, Tokyo,
Japan).
Second, the urinary albumin concentration was measured
by performing a turbidimetric immunoassay (Wako,
Osaka, Japan), and ACR was calculated as the urinary
albumin concentration divided by the urinary Cr concen￾tration in order to exclude the influence of the urinary vol￾ume. Microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were
defined as ACR 30-300 mg/g and >300 mg/g, respectively.
Third, the U-Col4 level was measured by performing a
one-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay using 2 mono￾clonal antibodies against the 7S domain and the other
against the triple helix (TH) domain (Panauria uIV C; Dai￾ichi Fine Chemical Co Ltd., Takaoka, Japan). U-Col4CR
was calculated as the U-Col4 concentration divided by the
urinary Cr concentration in order to compensate for the
urinary volume.
We calculated the normal cut-off range of ACR and U￾Col4 for 442 healthy adults (age, 20-70 years) who
yielded normal results on both physical examination and
laboratory analyses. For statistical analysis, data are
reported as means ± S.D. and the 95th percentile was
used. The normal cut-off range for the ACR was found to
be less than 17.9 mg/g and for U-Col4CR was less than 8.2
μg/g and 9.4 μg/g for males and females, respectively.
Statistical analysis
In the analysis of the baseline characteristics, continuous
variables of normal distribution were evaluated for statis￾tical significance across the GFR grade using ANOVA. A χ2
test was used for statistical comparisons of the GFR grade
and the abnormal rate noted for each variable assessed in
the participants. Both univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analyses were performed to assess the correla￾tion among the risk factors identified for each classified
age group and the gender, BMI, HbA1c, ACR, U-Col4CR,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, alcohol intake and
smoking habit. The odds ratio (95% confidence intervals
[CIs]) was calculated using a multivariate logistic regres￾sion analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Ethical approval
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Arita-cho, HuBit genomics, Inc. and was performed in
compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Results
eGFR Distribution
The eGFR was evaluated in 1554 participants; the histo￾gram in Figure 1 shows standard deviation. The average
eGFR and standard deviation values for all participants
were 80.2 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and 15.22, respectively
(those for males were 80.6 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and
14.80, respectively and females, 80.0 mL/min per 1.73 m2
and 15.46, respectively).
Characteristics of the study participants among the groups 
formed on the basis of the eGFR
The baseline characteristics of the participants are shown
in Table 1. The mean values observed for BMI, HbA1c,
hemoglobin, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL
cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
ACR, and U-Col4CR were significantly different among
the 3 groups.
Frequency of abnormal variables among the groups 
formed on the basis of the eGFR
The frequency with which abnormal values of BMI, total
cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and ACR were
measured differed significantly among the 3 groups. How￾ever, the serum levels of AST, ALT, and γ-GT did not differ
among the groups (Table 2). Moreover, the rate at which

abnormal values were recorded for HbA1c or U-Col4 excre￾tion did not differ among groups.
Prevalence of low eGFR and albuminuria with low eGFR 
and proteinuria
The prevalence of low eGFR for males and females was
6.6% and 9.4%, respectively. Among the individuals with
low eGFR, the prevalence of microalbuminuria was
23.7% and 10.9% for males and females, respectively, and
the prevalence of macroalbuminuria was 5.3% and 3.3%
for males and females, respectively.
The prevalence of proteinuria with low eGFR was 5.3%
and 4.9% and with eGFR >60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 was
6.9% and 0.7% for males and females, respectively.
Relationship between medical history and eGFR
A medical history of heart disease, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia was significantly associated with low
eGFR (Table 3). However, a medical history of diabetes
mellitus and renal disease was not associated with a low
eGFR.
Relationship between lifestyle and eGFR
Factors such as an alcohol intake, insufficient exercise,
exercise habits, excess fat and salt intake, and weight
changes from the age of 20 years were found to be signif￾icantly associated with a low eGFR. The percentages of
drinkers and non-drinkers with low eGFR were 52% and
48% for males and 15% and 85% for females, respec￾tively. However, smoking, eating at normal speed, and
regular meal consumption were not significantly related
to low eGFR (Table 4).
Risk factors for different values of eGFR
To further investigate the factors influencing eGFR, a mul￾tiple regression analysis was applied to identify an opti￾mal subset for the parameter that exhibits the strongest
relationship with eGFR (Table 5). Factors such as age, U￾Col4CR, medical history of hypertension and hyperlipi￾demia were found in the group with mild decreased eGFR
(eGFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m2) in a statistically signif￾icant manner (odds ratio: 1.07, 0.59, 1.47, and 2.12,
respectively). However, in the group with low eGFR, age,
gender, and a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia
were found to be associated factors (odds ratio: 1.21, 4.33,
2.49, and 7.86, respectively).
Risk factors for low eGFR in the different age groups
We divided the participants into 2 groups on the basis of
their ages. An eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 was consid￾ered as the control, the results of adjusted multivariate
logistic regression analyses performed to identify the fac￾tors associated with low eGFR are shown in Table 6.
In the group aged <65 years (younger group), factors such
as higher age, high ACR, and hyperlipidemia were found
to be associated with low eGFR in a statistically significant
manner (odds ratio: 1.17, 6.28, and 9.43, respectively),
whereas BMI, HbA1c, U-Col4CR, and hypertension were
not associated with these diseases. However, in the elderly
group (aged ≥ 65 years), male gender, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia were associated with low eGFR in a statis￾tically significant manner (odds ratio: 2.97, 1.62, and
1.97, respectively), whereas BMI, HbA1c, ACR, and U￾Col4CR were not. Thus, higher age and hyperlipidemia
were the common risk factors, while the risk of having low
eGFR was associated with ACR in the younger group and
hypertension status in the elderly group.
Discussion
In the present cross-sectional, community-based study,
the prevalence of CKD (defined as an eGFR of <60 mL/
min per 1.73 m2) was 8.4%. ACR is thought to be an inde￾pendent associated factor for CKD, especially in individu￾als aged <65 years; however, U-Col4CR is not regarded as
an associated factor for CKD despite its association with a
decrease in the eGFR.
Measuring the GFR is regarded as the gold standard for
assessing renal function. GFR is evaluated through the
measurement of the urinary clearance of an ideal filtration
marker such as inulin. Measurement of urinary clearance
using exogenous markers is complex, expensive, and diffi￾cult to perform in routine clinical practice and cohort

studies. We used an abbreviated version of the Modifica￾tion of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula to estimate
the GFR [13-15], and the CKD status was classified into 5
stages on the basis of the eGFR values [16]. In the present
study, the prevalence of CKD (low eGFR) was 8.4%. Pre￾vious studies have reported the prevalence of CKD at
stages 3-5 in several different populations. The prevalence
was found to be 8.1% (white) and 3.8% (black) in 22,634
Americans aged 28-65 years (average age: 57.1 ± 11.6
years) in a study in which renal function had been esti￾mated using the MDRD formula [9]. Further, the preva￾lence was found to be 6.8% in a study involving 3,499
Southeast Asian people aged 35-55 years using the MDRD
formula [10]. In a community-based study on 7,316 Jap￾anese people aged ≥ 30 years (average age: 52.4 years), the
prevalence of this disease was estimated at 6.7% using the
MDRD formula and at 8.5% using the Cockcroft-Gault
equation [17]. The abovementioned results reveal that the
variation in prevalence of CKD may depend on the partic￾ipant characteristics, especially on their age and race, asso￾ciated risk factors, and methods used for estimating the
GFR. The Cr-based equations have been studied exten￾sively and applied widely; however, the calibration of
serum Cr assays to account for differences in the methods
used has not been sufficiently standardized across labora￾tories.
The present study showed that lower eGFR values were
likely to be related to high values of BMI, serum choles￾terol, triglyceride, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
and ACR. The eGFR was inversely correlated to age (p <
0.001); this relationship between eGFR and age has been
reported in a community study performed in the USA
[18], an adult study conducted in the USA [19], and a
cross-sectional health survey conducted in Norway [20].
Urinary albumin was used as a biomarker to detect early￾stage diabetic nephropathy in type 1 [21] and type 2 dia￾betes [22]. Increased levels of urinary albumin excretion
(UAE) may also indicate an unfavorable renal prognosis.

However, screening for UAE is difficult because the cut-off
range of ACR depends on the laboratory and sample col￾lection methods used, such as collection at 24 h intervals,
timed collection of samples, and spot collection. We cal￾culated the normal cut-off range of ACR for 442 healthy
adults (age, 20-70 years) who yielded normal results on
both physical examination and laboratory analyses. In
this study, the prevalence of abnormal ACR was signifi￾cantly different among the 3 eGFR groups. The duration of
the disease is an important factor to be considered for
evaluating renal function. ACR measurement serves as a
useful marker for the diagnosis of ESRD, especially during
the early stage of proteinuria. ACR can be an independent
associated factor for CKD patients, especially those aged
<65 years. Our results indicate that ACR measurement is a
good diagnostic marker for patients in the younger group
with renal disease, but not for elderly patients with renal
disease in the community-based study.
The present study showed that the participants with a low
eGFR were older and more likely to be obese and hyper￾tensive. Therefore, it is important to detect CKD and initi￾ate treatment as early as possible in older populations in
order to prevent the development of cardiovascular dis￾ease and ESRD [23]. The results of several cross-sectional
studies have revealed that older age, hypertension, and
diabetes mellitus are very strongly associated with a
higher prevalence of elevated serum Cr level [24,25].
Another study reported that the mean HDL cholesterol
levels were low, whereas both the systolic blood pressure
levels and BMI were high in subjects with a low eGFR [26].
In this study, the presence of a medical history of heart
disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, was signifi￾cantly related to low eGFR. These findings suggest that risk
factors for cardiovascular disease may also be associated
with decreased renal function. However, a history of dia￾betes mellitus and anemia was not related to low eGFR in
this study. A probable explanation for this might be the
self-reported medical history because the mean value of
HbA1c and hemoglobin was not abnormal in this popula￾tion.
Increasing lines of evidence suggest a relationship
between lifestyle and the development and progression of
CKD. In a previous case-control study, the effects of smok￾ing (but not alcohol consumption) on CKD were identi￾fied [27]; however, our results did not find any
appreciable risk among smokers. The association between

smoking and CKD was verified by a dose-response trend,
and an independent association was found to exist
between excessive alcohol consumption (≥ 4 servings of
alcohol per day) and CKD. When compared to the
absence of smoking and alcohol consumption, smoking
in combination with excessive alcohol consumption is
reported to be associated with an almost fivefold increase
in the odds ratio for developing CKD [28]. An excess of
salt intake often causes hypertension and long-term con￾sumption of fatty meals leads to hyperlipidemia. Exces￾sive alcohol intake can influence nutritional deficiency. In
the present study, a drinking habit and the consumption
of fatty and salty meals, which are associated with meta￾bolic disease, were found to be associated with low eGFR.
These associations may be influenced by sex and age in
participants. The amount of exercise and exercise habit
(doing physical activity with sweat) might be recom￾mended in the group with low eGFR. In contrast, smok￾ing, eating speed, and regular meal consumption were not
significantly related to low eGFR. These observations sug￾gest that the type of lifestyle might influence the develop￾ment and progression of CKD; however, there is no
detailed information on the influence of lifestyle in this
regard.
In diabetic nephropathy, mesangial matrix expansion and
thickening of glomerular basement membrane are typical
pathologic features, which are characterized by an
increase of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. U￾Col4 is one of the principal components of the renal ECM.
It has been reported that U-Col4 excretion increases in
patients with diabetic nephropathy [29], and the levels of
U-Col4 may be a useful indicator to detect the early phase
of diabetic nephropathy [12]. However, in the present
study, we observed that U-Col4CR was in fact inversely
associated with a mild decrease in eGFR (60-89 mL/min
per 1.73 m2), and a borderline association was observed
with diabetes (higher HbA1c). There was a higher preva￾lence of abnormal U-Col4 excretion and HbA1c with nor￾mal eGFR (≥ 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2) than with a mild
decrease in eGFR. This suggests that subjects with an early
phase of renal dysfunction and early diabetes with hyper￾filtration might have a normal eGFR. There were not clear
indications that U-Col4CR is a useful and early marker to
screen or monitor kidney function in a community popu￾lation. However, future investigations should focus on the
causes of severe CKD. However, in low eGFR subjects, age,
gender, and a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia
were found to be the associated risk factors.

Renal insufficiency increases in the elderly population;
therefore, we classified the subjects into 2 groups on the
basis of their ages. Both hyperlipidemia and ACR were
found to be associated with a significantly increased risk
for low eGFR (odds ratio, 9.43, and 6.28, respectively) in
the younger group. This may be because many older par￾ticipants may have received some treatment for their dis￾ease. Aggressive treatment administered to the younger
group to ameliorate hyperlipidemia and improve the ACR
during the early stages may prevent the decline of renal
function. However, gender, hypertension, and hyperlipi￾demia were associated with a significantly increased risk
for low eGFR (odds ratio, 2.97, 1.62, and 1.97, respec￾tively) in the elderly group. These results indicate that gen￾der (male) and hypertension can be important diagnostic
factors for CKD in the elderly group.
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not directly
measure the GFR; therefore, patients with at some stage of
eGFR may have been wrongly diagnosed as having no kid￾ney disease. Furthermore, we did not calibrate our serum
creatinine measurements to the methods of the Cleveland
Clinic, where the MDRD eGFR equation was derived. We
validated the MDRD eGFR equation in a local population,
and this also cause an overestimation in the prevalence of
CKD. Second, the ACR and U-Col4CR values were
obtained from a single survey because we used spot urine
samples that were collected only once. Several measure￾ments of both ACR and U-Col4CR should be performed
to accurately determine the average concentrations. Third,
prospective study designs should be considered for further
research on the relationship between the amount of salt
intake and eGFR because we did not measure salt intake
accurately. Finally, the cross-sectional design of the
present study makes it impossible to infer a causal rela￾tionship between CKD and its associated factors.
Conclusion
Our community-based study revealed that the equation
for predicting the GFR might be useful in clinical practice

and for investigating kidney function. In addition, we pro￾pose that ACR could be a biomarker for estimating the risk
of CKD in younger populations but not in older ones,
while U-Col4CR is not an associated factor for either pop￾ulation. We also observed that associated factors for cardi￾ovascular disease, such as heart disease, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia, were associated with renal dysfunction.
Thus, we conclude that an early diagnosis of CKD and the
identification of CKD-related associated risk factors by
using the appropriate biomarkers may be useful for pre￾serving renal function.
