Abstract
Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disorder
limited almost exclusively to women of reproductive age. LAM
affects about 5% of women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
LAM also occurs in women who do not have TSC (sporadic LAM).
TSC is a tumour suppressor gene syndrome characterised by
seizures, mental retardation, and tumours in the brain, heart, and
kidney. Angiomyolipomas, which are benign tumours with smooth
muscle, fat, and dysplastic vascular components, are the most
common renal tumour in TSC. Renal angiomyolipomas also occur in
63% of sporadic LAM patients. We recently found that 54% of these
angiomyolipomas haveTSC2 loss of heterozygosity, leading to the
hypothesis that sporadic LAM is genetically related to TSC. In this
study, we screened DNA from 21 women with sporadic LAM for
mutations in all 41 exons of TSC2. Twelve of the patients had
known renal angiomyolipomas. No TSC2mutations were detected.
We did find three silentTSC2 polymorphisms. We conclude that
patients with sporadic LAM, including those with renal
angiomyolipomas, do not have a high frequency of germline
mutations in the coding region of TSC2.
