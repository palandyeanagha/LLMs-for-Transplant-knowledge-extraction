Abstract
To evaluate the relevance of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) expression and tumor development, we compared
melanoma growth in CCR5 knockout (CCR52/2) mice and wild type (CCR5+/+
) mice. CCR52/2 mice showed reduced tumor
volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5+/+ mice. We investigated the activation of NF￾kB since it is an implicated transcription factor in the regulation of genes involving cell growth, apoptosis, and tumor
growth. Significant inhibition of DNA binding activity of NF-kB, and translocation of p50 and p65 into the nucleus through
the inhibition of phosphorylation of IkB was found in the melanoma tissues of CCR52/2 mice compared to melanoma
tissues of CCR5+/+ mice. NF-kB target apoptotic protein expression, such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax, was
elevated, whereas the survival protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, C-IAP1, was decreased in the melanoma tissues of
CCR52/2 mice. Interestingly, we found that the level of IL-1Ra, a tumor growth suppressive cytokine, was significantly
elevated in tumor tissue and spleen of CCR52/2 mice compared to the level in CCR5+/+ mice. Moreover, infiltration of CD8+
cytotoxic T cell and CD57+ natural killer cells was significantly increased in melanoma tumor and spleen tissue of CCR52/2
mice compared to that of CCR5+/+ mice. Therefore, these results showed that CCR5 deficiency caused apoptotic cell death of
melanoma through inhibition of NF-kB and upregulation of IL-1Ra.

Introduction
Chemokines are small soluble molecules that are best known for
their potent ability to induce cancer cell growth by inflammation.
Many types of cancer cells express chemokines and chemokine
receptors [1]. The accumulated evidence indicates that the
chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) and C-C chemokine
receptor (CCR5), which are potent chemotactic factors for
inflammatory cells, may be significantly involved in the pro￾liferation and metastasis of several cancers. Intermediate and
strong CCR5 expression is significantly associated with nonmeta￾static development of colorectal cancer [2], melanoma [3],
hepatoma [4], glioblastoma, Hodgkin lymphoma [5], as well as
oral and prostate cancer cells [6]. Local production of the CCL5 is
also important in the progression of breast cancer [7], and also
correlates with poor prognosis [8]. Meanwhile, CCR5 disruption
has been demonstrated to inhibit experimental tumor growth and
metastasis of pancreatic cancer [9]. In addition, host absence of
CCR5 potentiates the delay of tumor growth [10], and CCR5
inhibitors prevented cancer cell growth, such as prostate cancer
[11], breast cancer, hepatoma cells [4], and lung cancer [12].
These data suggest that the deficiency of inflammatory chemokine
receptor CCR5 may function as a suppressive receptor in cancer
progression. However, more studies are required to describe how
CCR5 deficiency acts in the inhibition of tumor development.
Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a member of the IL￾1 family, is a naturally occurring cytokine that competitively blocks
the IL-1 receptor [13]. Because IL-1Ra has been shown to inhibit
tumor progression by promoting antitumor immune responses and
by enhancing the activity of chemotherapy, numerous studies have
examined the ability of IL-1Ra to block tumor progression. IL￾1Ra expression was reduced in prostate [14], breast [15], and skin
cancer [16]. It was also reported that endogenous IL-1Ra deficient
mice developed aggressive tumors following exposure to carcino￾gens [17]. Meanwhile, proliferation of the melanoma cells that
were transduced with IL-1Ra gene was reduced and inhibited
melanoma development [18]. IL-1R blockade also reduced
hepatic tumor growth [19]. Moreover, it has also been reported
that IL-1Ra reduces fibrosarcoma development [20], B16
melanoma growth and metastasis [21], colon adenocarcinoma
growth [22], and skin cancer development [23]. IL-1 knockout
mice injected with melanoma failed to develop solid tumors [24].
It was also found that IL-1Ra, combined with temozolomide and
docetaxel chemotherapy, demonstrated more significant antitu￾mor activity against B16 melanoma cells in vivo [25]. These data

indicate that IL-1Ra is important as a tumor growth suppressing
cytokine.
NF-kB plays a crucial role in the suppression of apoptosis, as
well as the induction of cell proliferation and inflammation, and
is closely associated with cancer development [26]. Constitutive
activation of NF-kB has been described in a great number of
cancers including colon cancers, prostate cancers and melanoma
[27], and was found to up-regulate anti-apoptotic genes and/or
down regulate apoptotic gene expression [28]. Although NF-kB
promotes tumor growth, it is required for the immune system to
function normally [29]. Studies on c-Rel-deficient mice
demonstrated that c-Rel is essential for IL-2, IL-3, GM-CSF,
and IFNc expression in T lymphocytes [30]. C-Rel-deficient
mice also have a tissue-specific deficiency of various cytokines
and growth factors in T cells and macrophages affecting both
innate and humoral immune responses in the host [31].
Therefore, NF-kB can be specially targeted to prevent cancer
cell growth by (1) directly affecting apoptotic cancer cell death,
(2) stimulating tumor killing lymphocytes infiltration or (3)
increasing the production of tumor killing lymphokines.
Activation of NF-kB is important in the regulation of CCR￾mediated tumor growth and metastasis. It was reported that
inhibition of NF-kB by dehydroxymethyl-epoxyquinomicin
(DHMEQ) induces cell death of primary effusion lymphoma
by inhibition of CCR5 expression [32]. Activation of NF-kB
also increases CCL5-mediated oral cancer motility (5) and lung
metastasis [33]. Thus, it is possible that inhibition of NF-kB
could be involved in CCR5 mediated tumor development.
NF-kB transcription factor binding sites are present in the
promoter region of proinflammatory cytokine genes, such as IL￾1alpha, IL-6, GM-CSF, and KC [34]. On the other hand, the IL￾1Ra is a negative regulator of the inflammatory response. Several
studies have demonstrated the ability of IL-1Ra to abrogate the
proinflammatory effects of IL-1. Smith et al. suggested that the
regulation of IL-1Ra gene expression is a complex event involving
the interactions of three different transcription factors; NF-kB/
PU.1/GA-binding protein binding site [35]. Nuclear translocation
of NF-kB (p65) was significantly enhanced and prolonged in IL￾1Ra-deficient mice, compared to that in wild type mice [36].
Intracellular IL-1Ra (icIL-1Ra) was found to inhibit IL-1 by
blocking NF-kB signal transduction pathways in inflammatory
responses [37]. Because IL-1 has been shown to be an inducer of
NF-kB activation [38], we hypothesized that the expression of IL￾1Ra could play an important role in the autocrine activation of
transcription factors NF-kB or vice versa. Thus, the aim of this
study was to evaluate the roles of NF-kB and IL-1Ra in the
chemokine receptor CCR5-mediated suppression of tumor de￾velopment.
Results
Inhibition of Tumor Development in CCR52/2 Mice
The effect of CCR5 in tumor development was investigated
using CCR5+/+ and CCR52/2 mice. B16-F0 melanoma cells
were inoculated subcutaneously into CCR5+/+ and CCR52/2
mice (n = 20). Tumor growth was monitored for 31 days. Tumor
growth in the CCR52/2 mice was significantly lower than that in
the CCR5+/+ mice. The tumor growth in the CCR52/2 mice was
reduced to 19.1%, whereas the tumor growth in the CCR5+/+
mice was only reduced to 24.3%, in both tumor weight (Figure 1A
and 1B) and tumor volume, respectively (Figure 1A and 1C).
These results correlated with mice survival rates. There was
a significant difference in survival rates between CCR52/2 mice
(75% of starting time) and CCR5+/+ mice (15%) at the end of the
experiment (Figure 1D). There was a significant difference in
survival rates between CCR52/2 mice and CCR5+/+ mice. At the
end of the experiment, 75% of the CCR52/2 mice survived while
only 15% of the CCR5+/+ mice survived. Subcutaneous tumors
were harvested from the sacrificed mice 31 days after inoculation.
The immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections, stained with
H&E and for proliferation antigen PCNA, revealed greater
inhibition of tumor cell growth in CCR52/2 mice. The histologic
findings after H&E staining indicated that the tumor tissues of the
CCR52/2 mice, but not those of the CCR5+/+ mice, contained
large areas of necrosis. PCNA reactive cells were significantly
reduced in the CCR52/2 mice (Figure 1E).
Decrease of NF-kB Activity in Tumor Tissue of CCR52/2
Mice
The activation of NF-kB plays a critical role in cancer cell
survival, especially melanoma cancer cells and in CCR5
expression. To evaluate whether the tumor inhibition was related
with the inactivation of NF-kB in melanoma, the DNA binding
activity of NF-kB was determined by electromobility shift assay
(EMSA) in melanoma tissue. The constitutively activated DNA
binding activity was reduced in the CCR52/2 mice tumor tissue
(Figure 2A). Moreover, the translocation of p50 and p-p65 into the
nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IkB was also
prevented in the tumor tissues of CCR52/2 mice (Figure 2B).
Immunofluorescence analysis also confirmed that the intensity of
nuclear staining for p50 had decreased in the tumor tissues of
CCR52/2 mice (Figure 2C).
Induction of Apoptotic Cell Death and Inhibition of the
Expression of Anti-apoptotic Proteins in CCR52/2 Mice
To see whether inhibition of NF-kB activity results in the
induction of apoptotic cell death and expression of NF-kB
target apoptotic cell death regulatory protein, the levels of
apoptotic cell death and expression of apoptotic cell death
regulatory proteins were assessed. Apoptotic cell death in the
tumor sections were evaluated in the CCR5+/+ and CCR52/2
mice that were inoculated with melanoma cells. TUNEL
staining revealed a higher frequency of apoptotic cell death in
the tumor tissues of the CCR52/2 mice than that of the
CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical and immu￾nofluorescence showed that high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and
Bax were found more frequently in the CCR52/2 mice than in
the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3B and 3C). Consistent with the
immunohistochemical data, Western blot analysis of tumor
proteins showed greater increased levels of cleaved caspase-3,
cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP and Bax, whereas the levels of
Bcl-2 and C-IAP1 were significantly decreased in CCR52/2
mice tissues (Figure 3D).
Upregulation of IL-1Ra in the Tumor and Spleen of
CCR52/2 Mice
To investigate the difference in the cytokine levels between the
tumor and spleen tissues of the CCR5+/+ and CCR52/2 mice, we
conducted a cytokine array assay using a Mouse Proteome Array
(Figure 4A). Among 40 tested cytokines, the levels of IL-1Ra,
MIG, MIP-1a increased about 686, 9 and 25-fold respectively, in
CCR52/2 mice compared to CCR5+/+ mice. Using this
technique, no other cytokines were found to be different between
the CCR52/2 mice and the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 4B). Similar
altered cytokine levels were found in the spleens of CCR52/2
mice (Figure 4C). Since the IL-1Ra level was the most significantly
elevated, the expression of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues was

analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The
expression of IL-1Ra was upregulated in tumor and spleen tissues
of the CCR52/2 mice (Figure 4D-G).
Induction of CD8 T cells and NK Cell Infiltration into
Tumor and Spleen of CCR52/2 Mice
To investigate whether the inhibition of tumor growth in
CCR52/2 mice is related to tumor-specific immune responses, we
analyzed the distribution patterns of CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and
CD57+ Natural Killer cells in tumor and spleen tissues. By staining
the tumor sections from CCR52/2 mice, we found that there was
a significant influx of CD8+ cells into the tumor, as well as an
increase in the number of infiltrating NK cells (Figure 5A). CD8+
T cells and CD57+ NK cells were spread diffusely throughout the
entire sections. To further investigate the differences in the
numbers of CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells between CCR5+/+
mice and CCR52/2 mice in immunity-related organ, we also
analyzed the CD8 and CD57 reactive cell number in spleen
tissues. The number of CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells were
higher in the spleen of the CCR52/2 mice than in the spleen of
the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5B). These data suggest that by
promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are

potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in an anti￾tumor effect in CCR52/2 mice.
To analyze the cell phenotype change in CCR52/2 mice and
CCR5+/+ mice by inoculation of the melanoma cell, lymphocytes
were isolated from the tumor and spleen tissues. The B, CD3 T,
CD4 T, CD 8 T and NK cell portion of CCR52/2 mice tumor
tissue were 7.2%, 48.2%, 16.9%, 32.1% and 7.8%, respectively,
compared to 2.9%, 11.1%, 2.3%, 0.6% and 3.1% of CCR5+/+
mice (Figure 5C). The lymphocytes that infiltrated the tumor tissue
of the CCR52/2 mice also had higher levels of CD19, CD3, CD4,
CD8 and CD57 when compared to the CCR5+/+ mice. The B,
CD3 T, CD4 T, CD 8 T and NK cell portion of the CCR52/2
mice spleen were 61.3%, 33.4%, 17.6%, 9.2% and 0.6%,
respectively compared to 38.3%, 5.9%, 4.0%, 1.0% and 3.9% of
the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5D). These data suggest that by
promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are
potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in the
inhibition of tumor growth in CCR52/2 mice.
Discussion
In the present study, we found that tumor weight and volume were
much smaller inthe CCR52/2 mice comparedtothe CCR5+/+mice
inoculated with B16 melanoma cells (Figure 1A and 1B). The tumor
growth inhibition in the CCR52/2 mice was associated with the
inhibition of constitutively activated NF-kB and elevation of IL-1Ra
in the tumor tissue. This anti-tumor activity was also associated with

kB, is significant in the inhibition of melanoma growth in CCR52/2
mice.
NF-kB regulates the expression of over 200 genes that control
the immune system, cancer cell growth and inflammation [39].
Because of its abilities to induce the expression of a large array of
inflammatory mediators and its roles as core transcription factors
in diverse immune responses, NF-kB has been recognized as
a major factor responsible for cytokine-associated cancer de￾velopment or anti-tumor immunity. In the melanoma tumor
tissues of the CCR52/2 mice, the expression of NF-kB target cell
death genes (Bax, caspase-3 and 9) and the DNA binding activity
of NF-kB, were significantly inhibited, but the expression of cell
death inhibitory NF-kB target genes, such as Bcl-2 and cIAP were
enhanced. In addition, CCR52/2 prevented the phosphorylation

of IkB, accompanied with the inhibition of the p50 and p65
translocation into the nucleus (Figure 2A-C). Many tumors,
including melanoma, have increased levels of NF-kB [40], which is
likely acting as a survival factor for melanoma growth. Thus, the
inhibitions of NF-kB activity and the expression of target genes are
critical in the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR52/2 mice.
Although the mechanism is not clear as to how CCR52/2
downregulates NF-kB, it is noteworthy that NF-kB is activated or
inactivated by many cytokines.
Numerous studies showed that cytokine affect tumor growth by
regulating NF-kB. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6
and IL-8, activate NF-kB pathways in tumor cells [41]. The
interleukin 10 (IL-10) is well known as an anti-tumor factor as well
as an anti-inflammatory factor [42,43]. IL-10 inhibits constitu￾tively activated NF-kB both in vitro [44] and in vivo [45]. Inhibition
of NF-kB by the IL-10 contributes to the anti-tumor effects
through the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis in Colon26-
bearing mice [43]. Similarly, several studies have demonstrated
the ability of IL-1Ra to abrogate the proinflammatory effects of
IL-1 [46]. It has been reported that IL-1 induces the activation of
NF-kB in several cancers, and increases cell cycle progression, and
the suppression of apoptotic cell death leading to tumor
promotion. The results of various studies over the past 10 years
indicate that the major function of IL-1Ra is to regulate the
pleiotropic effects of IL-1 by competitively blocking its functions
[47]. The ability of IL-1 to induce its own antagonist is of interest
in understanding the regulation and dysregulation of IL-1
signaling in normal and diseased tissue. Up-regulation of the
receptor antagonist represents a mechanism for turning off IL-1
signaling and creating a temporary state of refractoriness. The
elevated expression of IL-1Ra, without any change of IL-1 in
tumors, suggests that the IL-1-signaling system may be dysregu￾lated by IL-1Ra in tumors. IL-1Ra has been shown to inhibit
tumor progression in prostate, breast, and skin cancer [14,15,16].
Intracellular IL-1Ra (icIL-1Ra) inhibits IL-6 and IL-8 production
in Caco-2 cells by blocking NF-kB pathways [37]. We found that
the levels of IL-1Ra were significantly elevated in the tumor tissues
of CCR52/2 mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells. Taken
together, these data indicate IL-1Ra could be critically involved in
the tumor growth inhibition of CCR52/2 mice through the
inactivation of NF-kB in the present study.
CCR5 increases tumor growth in a local model and inhibits
the efficacy of a dendrite cell vaccine in CCR5+/+ mice
compared with CCR52/2 mice [10]. Cheng J and Sung RS
examined the effect of CCR5 on the immune response to
adenovirus vectors and graft function in an islet transplant
model. They found that CCR5 absence does not prevent the
local immune response to adenovirus transduction [48]. Addi￾tionally, Tan MC et al. suggested that disruption of CCR5/
CCL5 signaling, either by reducing CCL5 production by tumor
cells or by systemic administration of a CCR5 inhibitor (TAK￾779), reduced Treg (regulatory T cells) migration to tumors so
that tumors are smaller in control mice [9]. These data support
the important premise that inhibition of tumor growth in
CCR52/2 mice could be related with the inhibition of immune
escape. Similar to this finding, we found that the CCR5+/+ mice
injected with melanoma cells apparently have a lower number of
cytotoxic T cells (CD8+positive T Lymphocytes cells) and natural
killer cells (CD57 positive NK cells), as well as dendrite cells, in
spleen tissues compared to those without melanoma cells. But the
lymphocytes of the CCR52/2 mice did not decrease when
injected with melanoma cells. These differences of the immune
response between the CCR5+/+ mice and the CCR52/2 mice,
involving tumor immune tolerance, may be connected with the
inhibition of cancer progression. Taken together, in the cytokine
array experiment, the level of MIP-1a (which has a potent
activity of T cell and B cell migration) was increased in the
CCR52/2 mice compared with those in the CCR5+/+ mice.
Thus, relatively increased tumor associated cytotoxic lympho￾cytes could play an important role in inhibiting the tumor growth
in CCR52/2 mice.
Activation of NF-kB could modulate subcellular localization of
NK cells and pathogenesis [49]. Inhibition of NF-kB activity
prevented NK cell depletion, and thus increased anti-tumor
activity by decreasing IL-6 production [50]. Thus, the decreased
NF-kB and elevated IL-1Ra could also be associated in the
infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes into tumor, resulting in tumor
growth inhibition. In contrast, IL-23, a tumor growth promoting
cytokine, increased NF-kB and immune cell infiltration in oral
tumor [51]. These data indicate that NF-kB could be involved in
the cytokine mediated anti-tumor activities of immune cells. It is
also noteworthy that IL-1Ra inhibited melanoma tumor growth by
increasing the number of myeloid suppressor cells in tumor [25].
The 3-methylcholatrene-induced tumor incidence was reduced in
IL-1a knockout mice, but increased in IL-1Ra mice with
concomitant maturation of NK cells and anti-tumor immunity
[52]. These data indicate that the decrease of NF-kB, and thus
increase of IL-1Ra could be significant in tumor growth inhibition
of CCR52/2 mice.
Our data thus show significant clinical implications of CCR5,
because CCR5 is a G protein–coupled receptor and it is
amenable to use as a small molecule for the inhibition of CCR5.
Several such compounds have already been shown to be safe in
clinical trials for use in certain diseases such as HIV [53]. Thus,
we believe CCR5 is a cancer target that warrants continued
investigation. In summary, this study showed that melanoma cells
growth was inhibited via modulation of NF-kB/IL-1Ra pathways
in CCR52/2 mice.

were F2 hybrid mice from the C57BL/6J-AW-J and 129P3/J
parental strains. CCR5 mice (B6, 129P2-Ccr5tm1Kuz/J) have the
entire coding region of the CCR5 gene deleted from the parental
strains, B6;129P2-Ccr5tm1kuz and B6;129P2-Cmkbr5tm1Kuz.
Tumor Inoculation and Tumor Monitoring
B16 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously [56105
tumor cells in 0.1 ml Phosphate buffered saline(PBS)/animal]
using a 27 G needle into the right-lower flanks of the carrier mice

as previously described [54]. The body weights and tumor
volumes of the animals were monitored twice weekly. The tumor
volumes were measured with Vernier calipers and calculated using
the following formula: (A6B2
)/2, where A is the larger and B is the
smaller of the two dimensions. At the end of the experiment,
the animals were sacrificed. The tumors were separated from the
surrounding muscles and dermis.
Western Blotting
Tumor tissues were homogenized with protein extraction
solution (PRO-PREPTM, Intron Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea),
and lysed by 60 min incubation on ice. The tissue lysate
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4uC. Equal amounts of
proteins (40 mg) were separated on a SDS/12%-polyacrylamide
gel, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane (GE Water and Process technologies, Trevose, PA,
USA). Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5%
(w/v) non-fat dried milk in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 [TBST:
10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl solution containing
0.05% Tween-20]. After a short washing in TBST, the
membranes were immunoblotted with the following primary
antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against p65 and
p50 (1:500 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),
rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Bax and PARP
(1:500 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and against caspase￾3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and c-IAP-1 (1:1000 dilutions; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA). The blots were incubated with the
respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti￾mouse IgG (1:4000 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL detection
system.
Immunohistochemistry
All specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
for examination. Sections (4 mm thick) were stained with H&E and
analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The paraffin-embedded
sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, washed in distilled
water, and then subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation in
3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min, followed by
clearing in PBS for 5 min. The sections were blocked for 30 min
with 3% normal horse serum diluted in PBS, blotted, and
incubated with primary mouse anti-mouse proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA, 1:200 dilution) monoclonal antibodies
in blocking serum for 4 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the
slides were washed three times for 5 min each in PBS and
incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies
for 2 h. The slides were washed in PBS, followed by the addition
of the avidin biotin peroxidase complex (ABC kit; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The slides were washed
and the peroxidase reaction was developed with diaminobenzidine
(DAB) and peroxide, followed by counterstaining with hematox￾ylin, mounting in aqua-mount, and evaluation under a light
microscope (magnification6200; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). A
negative control was included in all experiments by omitting the
primary antibody. For the detection of apoptotic cell death in the
tumor tissues, the paraffin-embedded sections were incubated in
a mixture of the labeling solution (540 ml) and enzyme solution
(60 ml) for 1 h at 37uC, and then washed three times in 0.1 M PBS
for 5 min each, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Next, the sections were incubated with 49,6-diamidino-2-pheny￾lindole (DAPI) for 15 min at 37uC. Finally, the sections were
rinsed, mounted on slides, and cover-slipped for fluorescence
microscopy (DAS microscope).
Immunofluorescence
Sections were treated with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS
for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4uC with p50
(1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p65 (1:250,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Bax (1:200 dilution),
cleaved caspase-3 (1:100), CD8 (1:10), CD57 (1:50) and IL-1Ra
(1:500) antibodies, followed by incubation in anti-mouse IgG
conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:100 dilution, Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa
568 (1:100 dilution, Molecular Probes) for 40 min at room
temperature. Finally, the sections were rinsed, mounted on slides,
and cover-slipped for fluorescence microscopy and photography
using ApoTome microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).
Gel Electromobility Shift Assay
A gel electromobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega,
Madison, WI). The tumor tissues were briefly homogenized in
200 ml of solution A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2,
10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfo￾nylfluoride), vortexed vigorously, incubated on ice for 10 min, and
then centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 min. The pelleted nuclei
were resuspended in solution C (solution A supplemented with
420 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol), and incubated on ice for
20 min. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for
15 min, and the resulting nuclear extracts supernatant were
collected in a chilled Eppendorf tube. Consensus oligonucleotides
were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [P32]-ATP
for 10 min at 37uC. The gel shift reactions were assembled and
incubated at room temperature. Subsequently, 1 ml of gel loading
buffer was added to each reaction and loaded onto a 6% non￾denaturating gel. The gel was subjected to electrophoresis until the
dye was four-fifths of the way down the gel. The gel was dried for
1 h at 80uC and exposed to film overnight at -70uC.
Flow Cytometric Analysis
Lymphocytes were obtained from tumor and spleen tissues for
phenotype analysis. Spleen and tumor lymphocytes were isolated
from fresh spleen and tumor biopsies obtained from three mice per
group. Spleen and tumor biopsies were briefly homogenized
mechanically in PBS, filtered (100 mm cell strainer; BD PharMin￾gen) and then placed in lysis buffer (ACK lysing buffer, LONZA)
to remove red blood cells. One million splenocytes were washed
once in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and re￾suspended in 100 ml of PBS/BSA buffer. Meanwhile, one million
cells obtained from tumor tissues were placed in RPMI medium,
incubated to obtain suspension cell for 1hour at 37uC, centrifuged
(1200 rpm, 3 min) and then washed in PBS. Next, the lympho￾cytes were incubated with various conjugated monoclonal
antibodies, including CD4-APC, CD8-FITC and CD19-PE for
20min at 4uC, washed twice in PBS, and re-suspended in 400 ml of
PBS. A flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSAria
flow cytometry (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using
the WinMDI statistical software (Scripps, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Forward and side scatter parameters were used to gate on
lymphocytes.
Protein Immuno-arrays
The tumor and spleen tissues were excised and homogenized in
PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and
Triton X-100 (final concentration 1%). The samples were frozen
at 270uC, thawed, and centrifuged at 10,0006g for 5 min to
remove cellular debris. The tissue lysates were performed protein

assay in the same way as for western blotting. 4.5 mg of proteins,
collected from three samples per group, were used for Mouse
cytokine array as the protocol provided by supplier (Proteome
ProfilerTM, #ARY006, R&D Systems, USA).
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 4 ver. 4.03
software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as
mean 6 SD. Difference between CCR52/2 mice and CCR5+/+
mice were compared using t test. A value of p,0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. Survival data were
presented by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and compared
and calculated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test in GraphPad
Prism.
