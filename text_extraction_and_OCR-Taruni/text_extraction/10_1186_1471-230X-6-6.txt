Abstract
Background: Liver biopsy is considered as the gold standard for assessing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
histologic lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of non-invasive markers of fibrosis,
validated in chronic viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease (FibroTest, FT), in patients with NAFLD.
Methods: 170 patients with suspected NAFLD were prospectively included in a reference center (Group 1), 97 in a
multicenter study (Group 2) and 954 blood donors as controls. Fibrosis was assessed on a 5 stage histological scale
validated by Kleiner et al from F0 = none, F1 = perisinusoidal or periportal, F2 = perisinusoidal and portal/periportal, F3
= bridging and F4 = cirrhosis. Histology and the biochemical measurements were blinded to any other characteristics.
The area under the ROC curves (AUROC), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive values (PPV,
NPV) were assessed.
Results: In both groups FT has elevated and not different AUROCs for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (F2F3F4): 0.86
(95%CI 0.77–0.91) versus 0.75 (95%CI 0.61–0.83; P = 0.10), and for F3F4: 0.92 (95%CI 0.83–0.96) versus 0.81 (95%CI
0.64–0.91; P = 0.12) in Group1 and Group 2 respectively. When the 2 groups were pooled together a FT cutoff of 0.30
had a 90% NPV for advanced fibrosis (Se 77%); a FT cutoff of 0.70 had a 73% PPV for advanced fibrosis (Sp 98%).
Conclusion: In patients with NAFLD, FibroTest, a simple and non-invasive quantitative estimate of liver fibrosis reliably
predicts advanced fibrosis.

Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a
spectrum of conditions characterized histologically by
excessive accumulation of hepatic fat in the absence of
alcohol consumption. Two main histological patterns of
NAFLD are described: fatty liver alone and steatohepatitis
(NASH). NAFLD is an increasingly recognized cause of
liver-related morbidity and mortality [1-3]. Although the
majority of patients do not develop complications, 28%
may develop serious liver sequelae, including end-stage
liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma [1-5]. Those at
highest risk include patients with significant hepatic
necro-inflammation and fibrosis [1,2,6]. Therefore liver
biopsy had been recommended for confirming diagnosis
and for providing prognostic information [7,8].
There are several drawbacks in using liver biopsy for this
purpose. This procedure is invasive, costly, and prone to
complications, some minor, such as pain, others more
severe with a recorded risk of death of 0.01% [9-11]. Nota￾bly, just as is the case in other chronic liver diseases, there
is considerable sampling variability (40% for fibrosis stag￾ing), and a high intra and inter-pathologist variabil￾ity[12,13]. Most importantly, the number of patients at
risk for NAFLD is high enough that liver biopsy is not a
practical and efficient tool for identifying those at risk of
advanced fibrosis. Indeed an estimated 15 to 20% of the
Western European population has steatosis [14] while
more than half of Americans are overweight or obese.
Because liver biopsy is impossible to perform in such large
cohorts of individuals, some investigators have tried to
identify simple non-invasive markers of liver injury, in
particular fibrosis, in patients with NASH. Different stud￾ies have shown that an age of 45 years or more, the extent
of obesity, type 2 diabetes, high levels of alanine ami￾notransferase and triglycerides, high HOMA indices of
insulin resistance, systemic hypertension, and high level
of C-peptide [6,15,16] are associated with advanced fibro￾sis in patients with NASH. However, these findings are not
consistent between studies and have been generated
through retrospective studies, all amenable to biases
known and unknown. Imaging techniques have moderate
predictive values for advanced steatosis but not for bridg￾ing fibrosis [17,18].
In the last 3 years, we developed 2 panels of simple bio￾chemical markers, named FibroTest (FT) and Actitest,
(Biopredictive Paris, France, FibroSURE in the US pat￾ented artificial intelligence algorithm USPTO 6,631,330
http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html). The fibrosis
index includes α2-macroglobulin (A2M), apolipoprotein
A1, haptoglobin, total bilirubin, and γ-glutamyl￾transpeptidase (GGT), and the necrotico-inflammatory
activity index combines the same 5 markers, plus ALT.
These panels demonstrated high predictive values for sig￾nificant lesions in patients with chronic hepatitis C [19-
28], chronic hepatitis B [25,29] and alcoholic liver disease
[30]. These diagnostic values were also confirmed by inde￾pendent groups and versus glycomics and elastometry
[31-34]. Because fibrosis features are similar between
patients with alcoholic liver disease and NAFLD, it was
logical to hypothesize that the diagnostic value of FT
would be the same.
The objective of the current study was to validate the diag￾nostic utility of FT for the detection of advanced fibrosis
in patients with NAFLD in two prospective validation
groups, one in a single center (Group 1) and one in mul￾ticenter study (Group 2). The specificity has been also
assessed in a large prospective cohort of blood donors.
Methods
Study population
Group 1
The inclusion criteria were patients with suspicion of
NAFLD hospitalized in our department having undergone
liver biopsy. To be included patients needed to have either
abnormal serum transaminases or GGT, or steatosis at
ultrasonography, or one feature of the metabolic syn￾drome: (1) fasting glucose greater than 6.1 mmol/l or a
previous diagnosis of diabetes; (2) body mass index of 27
or higher or waist circumference greater than 102 cm in
men and 88 cm in women; (3) blood pressure greater
than 130/85 or pharmacologically treated; (4) triglycer￾ide-levels greater than 150 mg/dl or current use of fibrates;
(5) HDL-cholesterol lower than 40 mg/dl (men) and 50
mg/dl (women). Exclusion criteria included daily alcohol
consumption of at least 50 gm of pure ethanol equivalent
for male and 30 gm for female during the preceding year,
concomitant liver diseases (presence of HCV antibody or
HBs antigen, auto-immune hepatitis, hemochromatosis
diagnosed by genetic markers, Wilson's disease, alpha
anti-trypsin deficiency), HIV antibody and immunosup￾pression, and an interval greater than 3 months between
serum sample and liver biopsy. Between January 2001
and December 2004, 232 patients were hospitalized for
suspicion of NAFLD; 170 patients were included and 62
patients were excluded: associated liver disease in two,
missing data in 39 (FT not performed in 37 patients,
biopsy not performed in 2 patients), and interval between
biopsy and markers greater than 3 months in 21 patients.
Characteristics are given in Table 1.
Group 2
These patients were patients of a prospective multicenter
study (CYTOL study group). The aim of the CYTOL study
was to assess the cause of chronic abnormal ALT or GGT
values in patients without heavy alcohol consumption,
without markers of HCV (HCV antibody), HBV (HBs anti-

gen), autoimmune hepatitis (negative for anti-actin, anti￾nuclear, anti-LKM1 antibodies), hemochromatosis
(genetic markers), Wilson's disease, and alpha anti￾trypsin deficiency. For the present study only the CYTOL
patients with hepatic steatosis at biopsy suspected of
NAFLD, were considered for inclusion. Between February
2002 and August 2004, among the 274 patients of the
CYTOL study, 166 patients with steatosis at biopsy were
considered for inclusion, 97 patients were included and
69 patients were excluded: 31 because followed in the
training center, and 58 because the presence of miscella￾neous associated liver diseases. Characteristics are given in
Table 1.
Control group
A total of 954 blood donors prospectively included were
used as controls.
All patients and controls gave informed consent for use of
data and serum for research purposes.
Histological analysis
Liver biopsies were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained
with at least hematoxylin-eosin-safran, iron staining, and
Masson's trichrome or picrosirius red for collagen. A sin￾gle pathologist unaware of patient characteristics analyzed
the histological features (FC) in Group 1 and in Group 2
(BLB). A scoring system recently published by Kleiner et al
[35] who studied inter observer variability was used.
Fibrosis was staged as follows: stage 0: no fibrosis; stage 1:
perisinusoidal or periportal fibrosis with 3 different pat￾terns: 1A: mild, zone 3, perisinusoidal; 1B: moderate,
zone 3, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and 1C portal/periportal
fibrosis; stage 2: perisinusoidal and portal/periportal
fibrosis; stage 3: bridging fibrosis; stage 4: cirrhosis. Stea￾tosis was scored from 0 to 3 with a four grades scoring sys￾tem from S0 to S3: S0_no steatosis or less than 5% (low to
medium -power evaluation of parenchymal involvement
by steatosis), S1_5%–33%, S2_>33%–66%, S3_>66%.
Steatohepatitis was defined as a NASH score (NAS) greater
than 5. The histological NAS score is defined as the
unweighted sum of the scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular
inflammation (0–3), and ballooning (0–2); thus ranging
from 0 to 8. Cases with NAS of 0 to 2 were largely consid￾ered not diagnostic of NASH; on the other hand, most
cases with scores of 5 or greater were diagnosed as NASH.
Cases with activity scores of 3 and 4 were considered as
borderline (probable) NASH [35].
Serum biochemical markers
The two panel markers for the prediction of activity and
fibrosis were the same as those validated in patients with
chronic hepatitis C [28], B [25,29] and alcoholic liver dis￾ease [30]: 1) FibroTest (FT) includes total bilirubin, GGT,
α2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, and haptoglobin,
corrected for age and gender and is designed for a quanti￾tative assessment of fibrosis; and 2) Actitest which
includes ALT in addition to the above specified markers
and is designed for a quantitative assessment of histolog￾ical activity in chronic viral hepatitis. Values of FibroTest
and Actitest range from zero to 1.00 with higher values
indicating a greater probability of significant lesions.
AST, ALT, GGT, cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid and
total bilirubin were measured by autoanalyzer Hitachi
917 Automate (Mannheim, Germany) and Roche Diag￾nostics reagents (Mannheim, Germany). α2-macroglobu￾lin, apolipoprotein A1, and haptoglobin were measured
using an automatic nephelometer (BNII, Dade Behring;
Marburg, Germany). Insulin was measured by autoana￾lyzer Axsym (Abbott, Irwin Texas, USA) and C-peptide by
autoanalyzer IMMULIT (DPC, Los Ageles California,
USA). HDL and LDL cholesterol were measured by auto￾analyzer Kone (Thermo, Vantaa, Finland). The laboratory
followed the recommended and validated procedures to
insure reproducibility between FT components [22,23].
All the biochemical components have been prospectively
assessed and assays were performed on fresh serum.
Statistical analyses
The primary outcome was advanced fibrosis (F2, F3 and
F4). In a secondary analysis, patients were classified
according to the presence of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis
(F3F4). Sensitivity analysis compared patients without or
with moderate alcohol consumption, patients with ele￾vated or not baseline ALT, patients without high risk of
FibroTest failures, patients with baseline biopsy length
smaller than 25 mm or greater, with or without frag￾mented biopsy and patients with paired biopsies.

risk factors of failure as previously detailed [27]. Risk fac￾tors of FT failure were hemolysis, Gilbert's disease, acute
inflammation and extrahepatic cholestasis. Risk factors of
biopsy failure were biopsy size (less than 25 mm) and
fragmentation (more than one fragment). Failure attribut￾able to biopsy (false negative) was suspected when the
biopsy was smaller than 15 mm and fragmented and
without risk failure of FT [27].
Statistical analysis used Fisher's exact test, the chi-square
test, Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney test and variance
analysis using the Bonferroni all-pair wise and Tukey￾Kramer multiple-comparison tests to take into account
the multiple comparisons and multiple logistic regression
for multivariate analysis. The diagnostic values of the
markers were assessed using sensitivities, specificities,
positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), and
the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves
(AUROC). AUROC curves were calculated including FT
quantitative values using empirical non-parametric
method according to Delong et al [36] and compared
using the method of Zhou et al [37]. For all analyses, two￾sided statistical tests were used; a P-value of 0.05 or less
was considered significant. Number Cruncher Statistical
Systems 2003 software (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA) was
used for all analyses.
Results
Patients
A total of 170 patients were included in Group 1 and 97
in Group 2. Characteristics of patients included in Group
1 and Group 2 as well as those of the non-included groups
were similar (Table 1). The only significant differences
observed between Group 1 and Group 2 was for Group 2
younger mean age, less metabolic factors, more fibrosis
stage 1, more severe steatosis and more NASH than in
Group 1. The biopsy size in Group 1 was longer with more
portal tracts than in Group 2. One case in Group 1 had a
severe adverse event of biopsy with gallbladder perfora￾tion. The histological diagnosis was made during the sur￾gical operation.
Among 267 included patients, 24 (9%) patients declared
"at risk" daily alcohol consumption, between 30 g and 40
g for 17 males and between 20 g and 25 g for 7 females.
Diagnosis of fibrosis
When compared to patients with no or mild fibrosis (F0-
F1), those with advanced fibrosis (F2-F4) were older,
without difference for gender (Table 2). Mean levels of α2-
macroglobulin, total bilirubin and FT were higher and
apoA1 lower. By multivariate analysis, age (P < 0.0001),
α2-macroglobulin (P < 0.0001), GGT (P = 0.01), bilirubin
(P = 0.02) and apoA1 (P = 0.048) were independently pre￾dictive of advanced fibrosis (model r2, 0.38; P < 0.0001).
ROC curves of FT for predicting fibrosis are illustrated in
Figure 1. For the primary outcome, the detection of F2 to
F4 fibrosis, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 ± 0.04.
For the detection of F3-F4, the area under the ROC curve
was 0.92 ± 0.04.
The distribution of FT according to the stage of fibrosis is
illustrated in Figure 2. In 954 blood donors the median FT
value was 0.085 (95% CI: 0.082–0.090). The median in
77 patients without fibrosis (F0) was 0.18 (0.14–0.21); in
53 patients with mild fibrosis (F1), 0.23 (0.16–0.26); in
20 patients with moderate fibrosis (F2), 0.36 (0.28–0.60);

in 11 patients with bridging fibrosis (F3), 0.58 (0.45–
0.80); and in 9 patients with cirrhosis (F4), 0.63 (0.52–
0.91). All differences were significant (P < 0.05) except
between F0 and F1 and between F3 and F4. Among blood
donors the security algorithms permitted to exclude 29
(3%) patients with high risk of false positive or negative.
Among the remaining 925 controls 24 (2.6%) patients
had FT between 0.30 and 0.48 and none above.
Diagnostic values of FT for predicting Fibrosis in the two
groups are given in Table 3 and for the overall population
in Table 4. An FT score of 0.30 had 77% sensitivity and
90% negative predictive value for advanced fibrosis. An FT
score of 0.70 had 98% specificity and 76% positive predic￾tive value. FT was highly sensitive for the detection of
bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3F4): an FT equal to or
higher than 0.30, had 92% sensitivity and 98% negative
predictive value for F3F4.
Analysis of discordance
In group 1, There was a clinically significant (2 stages or
more) discordance in 17 patients (10%): 5% due to FT
failure (9/170), 4% due to biopsy failure (6/170) and
indeterminate in 1% (2/170). For 7 out of these 17
patients, the fibrosis stage estimated by biopsy was higher
than the one estimated by FT. In one case the cause of fail￾ure was certainly attributable to FT since a well known
cause of false negative was present: a case with an acute
inflammation (urinary sepsis) and high haptoglobin.
There was a possible cause of FT false negative in three
cases with highly elevated ApoA1. In three cases there was
a possible cause of failure of biopsy (poor quality: 7 mm
with 3 fragments, 13 mm with 2 fragments and 21 mm
with 3 fragments, respectively) with no known cause of
false negative of FT. For the remaining 10 patients the
fibrosis stage was two stages lower than estimated by FT.
In four cases there was a certain cause of failure of FT
namely Gilbert syndrome. In four cases there was a possi￾ble false negative for liver biopsy in the absence of a cause
of false positive FT values: a case (25 mm, 2 fragments)
with a low platelet count of 130,000/mm3 and gastric
varices at endoscopy; a case with a biopsy of 20 mm (1
fragment) and a low platelet count of 143,000/mm3; a
case with a biopsy of 15 mm (5 fragments) and a low
platelet count of 146,000/mm3; another with a biopsy of
25 mm and 2 fragments. Two cases had no attributable
cause of failure: a good quality biopsy (20 mm, one frag￾ment for one and 30 mm, one fragment for the other)
with no risk factors for false positive FT values.
In group 2 there was a clinically significant (2 stages or
more) discordance in 10 patients (10%): 2% due to FT
failure (2/97), 2% due to biopsy failure (2/97) and inde￾terminate in 6% (6/97). For 9 out of these 10 patients, the
fibrosis stage estimated by biopsy was higher than the one
estimated by FT. In two cases the cause of failure was
attributable to FT with inflammation (CRP elevated) and
high haptoglobin. In one case there was a possible cause
of failure of biopsy, a possible false positive with poor
quality biopsy 10 mm with 3 fragments and no known
cause of false negative of FT. In one case the fibrosis stage
estimated by FT was higher than the one estimated by
biopsy. The biopsy was small 10 mm and platelet count
was low (120.000), without cause of false positive FT and
therefore a false negative of the biopsy is possible.
Diagnosis of non alcoholic steatohepatitis
FT had no significant diagnostic value for NASH (AUROC
= 0.59 se = 0.06; p = 0.15). ActiTest had a statistically sig￾nificant (AUROC = 0.62 se = 0.06; p = 0.04) but very weak
diagnostic value for NASH.
All patients included with histological diagnosis of NASH
(borderline or NASH) had steatosis. A total of 75 patients

(44%) had steatosis without NASH (borderline or NASH)
in group 1 and 29 (30%) in group 2. Advanced fibrosis
(F2F3F4) was more frequent in patients with NASH than
in those with steatosis alone: 30/95 (32%) and 30/68
(44%) in patients with NASH, versus 10/75 (13%; P =
0.005) and 1/29 (3%;P < 0.0001) in patients with steato￾sis alone, in group 1 and 2 respectively.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses revealed that the FT AUROCs for the
diagnosis of advanced fibrosis were not affected by ALT
values (Table 5). ALT was not significantly higher in
patients with advanced fibrosis than in those with early
fibrosis (Table 2). Seventeen patients out of 40 (43%)
with advanced fibrosis had ALT lower than 50 IU/L.
AUROCS were higher but not significantly in patients
with a biopsy size greater than 25 mm, and after exclusion
of patients with Gilbert syndrome and acute inflamma￾tion (Table 5). When the 24 patients who drank at least 20
g alcohol/day in women, and 30 g/day in men have been
excluded, the FT diagnostic value of the FibroTest was
even higher (not significantly) with an AUROC for
F2F3F4 = 0.82 (95%CI 0.74–0.87) in the remaining 243
patients (Table 5).
FibroTest and biopsy sampling variability
A total of 47 patients had 2 liver biopsy samples collected
on the same day. Fibrosis staging was concordant in 27
(57%) and discordant in 20 (43%) out of the 47 patients.
The discordance was 3 stages in one case, with bridging
fibrosis in one sample (F3) and no fibrosis (F0) in the
other; FT was 0.40 that is F1-F2 in the conversion system.
In 2 cases the discordance was of 2 stages: in one case F4
versus F2 with a FT = 0.60 (F3); one case with F3 versus F1
with a FT = 0.61 (F3). In the remaining 17 cases the dis￾cordances were of one stage. The AUROC of FT was
slightly higher but not significantly when the mean
between the two biopsies stages performed in the same
patient was taken as the endpoint (Table 5).
Association between components of FT and biomarkers of 
metabolic syndrome (Table 6)
As expected ApoA1 was highly correlated with HDL cho￾lesterol and total cholesterol, and negatively correlated
with triglycerides. A2M was highly correlated with
insulinemia and C-peptide. GGT was associated with total
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol but not with triglycer￾ides. FT was associated with insulinemia and C-peptide.
There was no correlation between FT and its components
with glucose and uricemia (data not shown).
Discussion
Mass screening for significant liver injury in patients with
NAFLD will be an important medical challenge in the
years to come because of the epidemics of obesity and dia￾betes. The inability of liver biopsy to meet this challenge
makes the development of non-invasive, readily available,
and easy to perform serum markers, a high priority. This
study highlights the potential utility of FT for the predic￾tion of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, as previously
observed for patients infected with HCV, HBV and for
patients with alcoholic liver disease.
The first validation group included patients of a secondary
care center, which makes it liable to referral selection bias
but the second validation group was most representative
of less specialized centers. The demographic characteris￾tics of our patients, including age and gender distribution,
prevalence of cirrhosis, components of the metabolic syn￾drome, are similar to those reported by other studies from
France[6,38]. We have taken less limited inclusion criteria
concerning the alcohol consumption with inclusion of
patients up to 40 g of alcohol per day for male and up to

25 g for female. There is no consensual limit. However
when males with 30–45 g or women with 20–25 g or
more per day were excluded following Guideline for diag￾nosis of NAFLD [39], the diagnostic value of FT was even
better although not significantly (Table 4).
An important limitation of liver biopsy is its sampling var￾iability [12]. The ideal gold standard should be not a 15
mm fragment but rather a 25 mm or sample [12]. In
chronic hepatitis C 18 % of the discordant results between
liver biopsy results and FT values have been attributed to
liver biopsy failures (mostly because of small sample size)
and 2% only to FT [27]. Histological lesions of NAFLD
including perisinusoidal fibrosis were unevenly distrib￾uted throughout the liver parenchyma [12]. Discordant
results of one stage or more between biopsy and FT were
at high as 41%. Being a serum marker, FT has the advan￾tage of representing a more global estimate of liver fibrosis
throughout the whole liver. One case was emblematic of
the weakness of even a 20 mm-long biopsy: a patient had
severe fibrosis (F3) on the first biopsy, no fibrosis on the
second biopsy (F0) and intermediate FT values (F1-F2).
Although not significant, the AUROC for FT was higher
when the mean fibrosis stage between the 2 biopsies was
taken into account (Table 4). Contrary to histological
staging systems which are all semi-quantitative, a serum
biochemical marker provides a continuous quantitative
assessment of liver fibrosis in 100% of patients without
indeterminate cases [28].
Another drawback of liver biopsy is that for most practi￾tioners it seems almost unethical for it to be performed in
patients with normal serum transaminases values. Unfor￾tunately, many patients with NAFLD or NASH have nor￾mal ALT and some of them have advanced liver fibrosis
[40,41]. In the present study ALT was lower than 50 IU/L
in 43% of patients with advanced fibrosis. As in chronic
hepatitis C, FT AUROCs for the diagnosis of advanced
fibrosis in NAFLD were unchanged in patients with ALT
values lower than 50 IU/L (Table 4); Therefore FT could
allow the diagnosis of fibrosis even in patients that are not
eligible for liver biopsy.
A few other markers have been evaluated in NAFLD for
the diagnosis of fibrosis. Sakugawa et al, demonstrated in
112 patients with NAFLD, good diagnostic values for
hyaluronic acid and type IV collagen 7S for stage F3 and
F4 with AUROCs of 0.80 and 0.83 respectively [42]. Lainé
et al combined hyaluronic acid and the carbohydrate-defi￾cient transferrin/transferrin ratio in 173 patients with
increased serum aminotransferases and features of meta￾bolic syndrome [38]. Hyaluronic acid AUROC for F2F3F4
fibrosis was 0.92. In our experience in patients with
chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease FT had a
higher sensitivity than hylauronic acid, especially for the
diagnosis of moderate fibrosis [20,30]. Rosenberg et al.
studied a panel combining age, hyaluronic acid, amino
terminal propeptide of type III collagen and tissue inhibi￾tor of matrix metaloprotein-1 in 81 patients with NAFLD
[43]. They observed an AUROC of 0.87 for advanced
fibrosis, similar to FT AUROC in the present study [43].
When comparing the performance of different serum
markers for liver fibrosis the diagnostic yield is far from
being the only aspect that needs to be considered [44].
Equally important are the description of analytical condi￾tions for serum measurements including intra patient and
intra sample variability, the description of precautions of
use and the identification of cases with discordant results
between serum markers and liver biopsy as well as risk fac￾tors for these discordances [22,23,27,45]. In the present
study we observed 5% of discordances due to FT failure
versus 4% due to biopsy failure. We recognize that in the
analysis of discordance, we assert that in patients with no
known cause of false negative FT, and a small length
biopsy, we consider because of biopsy sampling error that
the discordance was due to failure of biopsy. We acknowl￾edge that in these cases there is no direct prove of failure
of biopsy when no second biopsy and no other independ￾ent marker have been performed. As previously described

Gilbert's syndrome and acute inflammation were the
most frequent causes of FT failures. We observed a possi￾ble cause of false negative FT failure, not previously
described: an unusual high serum apoA1 concentration
due to high serum HDL-cholesterol (correlation between
ApoA1 and HDL cholesterol R = 0.77). This condition was
rare (3 cases out of 170, 1.8%) but is probably more fre￾quent than in other chronic liver diseases without lipids
abnormalities.
None of the FT components is a direct marker of hepatic
extracellular matrix nevertheless the overall score is corre￾lated with liver fibrosis. A2M is a protease inhibitor, but
also has multiple functions as a binding, carrier and tar￾geting protein [46]. A2M is associated with several growth
factors: fibroblast, vascular endothelial, epidermal, trans￾forming and platelet derived growth factors [19]. Interest￾ingly, in patients with NAFLD, the present study
demonstrated a very significant association between A2M
and insulin levels, a hallmark of insulin resistance. Rela￾tionships between A2M and insulin have been described
for more than 40 years [47]. Some studies have observed
an increase of A2M in diabetic patients [48]. Insulin is
covalently bound to A2M in plasma [49] and A2M is a
binding protein of Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding
Protein-1 (IGFBP-1) which modifies the IGFBP-1/IGF
interaction [50]. Therefore A2M can be directly involved
both in the hepatic mechanisms of insulin resistance and
fibrogenesis [50,51].
When compared to alcoholic liver disease the decrease of
apolipoprotein A1 was not significant in patients with
advanced fibrosis and NAFLD. The interpretation of this
negative observation must be prudent because of the
small number of patients with cirrhosis included in our
NAFLD population. We observed a dramatic decrease in
ApoA1 serum levels in patients with alcoholic liver disease
which was associated with necrosis, polymorphonuclear
infiltrate and Mallory bodies [30]. In the present NAFLD
population the prevalence of patients with severe necrosis
was small, and only 2 patients had a polymorphonuclear
infiltrate (1.2%). In the first case there was a dramatic
decrease in ApoA1 (0.05 g/L), as observed in alcoholic
steato-hepatitis. In the second case the absolute value of

ApoA1 was not decreased (1.72 g/L) but was relatively low
in comparison with HDL cholesterol (1.64 mmol/L).
Although in NAFLD there is no specific treatment
approved to treat liver injury, the diagnosis of advanced
fibrosis could be very important to motivate the patient
for diet or lifestyle modifications, for intensive treatment
of complications of the metabolic syndrome or for weigh￾ing in favour of anti-obesity surgery. The early detection of
advanced fibrosis is the first step to reduce future cirrho￾sis-related deaths. Diagnosing silent cirrhosis has impor￾tant consequences in terms of screening for portal
hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, of prevent￾ing complications and of timely indication for liver trans￾plantation.
Based on our data, a preliminary algorithm for the use of
FT as a screening tool in patients at risk for NAFLD can be
suggested. Below 0.30 the probability of cirrhosis is very
low and there is no need for ultrasonography or endos￾copy. Between 0.30 and 0.70 it is mandatory to help the
patient in reducing all metabolic factors (overweight, dia￾betes, dyslipidemia and maybe complete alcohol absti￾nence). Follow-up of these patients with FT can be
advised. When the FT value is 0.70 or higher, the patient
should be managed as a patient with cirrhosis, and sur￾veillance by ultrasonography and endoscopy should be
implemented in order to prevent potentially severe com￾plications of cirrhosis.
Conclusion
In patients with NAFLD, FibroTest-FibroSURE, a simple
and non-invasive quantitative estimate of liver fibrosis
reliably predicts advanced fibrosis
