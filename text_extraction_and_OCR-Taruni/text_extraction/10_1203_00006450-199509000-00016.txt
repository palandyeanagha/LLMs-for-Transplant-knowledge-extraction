ABSTRACT 
After liver transplantation in children, growth is often im￾paired, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Glucocor￾ticoids used for in~~nul~osuppressio~i are believed to be partly 
responsible. After renal transplantation in children, reduced 
growth hormone (GH) secretion and increased serum insulin-like 
growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels have becn 
reported. We attempted to find endocrine factors predicting 
growth in 18 prepubertal children followed for more than 1 y 
(mean 2.4 y) after liver transplantation. Spontaneous and stimu￾lated GH secretion, serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 concentrations, and 
endogenous cortisol production were measured. GH secretion 
was reduced in only two patients. Serum IGF-I concentration was 
normal, but serum IGFBP-3 was elevated or 1 SD above the 
mean for age in 62% of the patients. Endogenous cortisol pro￾duction was reduced in most patients during the first year and 
improvcd later in only a few. Growth velocity after transplan￾tation did not corrclalc with GH sccrclion, serum IGF-I or 
IGFBP-3 concentration, or with methylprcdnisolonc dose, but 
Chronic liver disease in childhood often results in growth 
rctardation (1, 2). This is believed to be mainly duc to nutri￾tional impairment (3), and alterations in the production or 
action of GH andlor IGF-I (4). Previously, prevention of 
growth retardation was not a primary aim in thcse patients, as 
their survival time was relatively short. Howevcr, during the 
last decade, liver Tx has offered long-term survival for these 
children. With improvement of diagnostic methods, surgical 
technique, immunosuppression, and treatment of complica￾tions, 4-y patient survival rates of 77 and 67% have been 
reported for children over and undcr 1 y of age, rcspectively 
(5). 
After a succcssful liver Tx, the long-term effects of chronic 
liver discase, for examplc malnutrition, gradually regress. Yet 
15-59% of the patients remain or drop outside of the normal 
range for height (6,7). The mcchanisms underlying this growth

correlated positively with serum basal (r, = 0.44, p < 0.05) and 
stimulated (r, = 0.53, p < 0.005) cortisol concentration. In 
conclusion, after liver transplantation 1) the normal pulsatile 
character of nocturnal GH secretion is sustained, and the GH 
response to stimulation is reduced in only a few patients; 2) 
serum IGF-I concentrations are normal; 3) serum IGFBP-3 con￾centrations are elevated or in the upper part of the normal range 
in most patients; and 4) endogenous cortisol production is re￾duced in most patients and correlates positively with growth 
velocity. (Pediatr Res 38: 366-372, 1995)

retardation are unknown, although glucocorticoid-mediated in￾hibition of GH secretion may be at least partly responsible (8). 
Abnormalities of thyroid function or calcium and phosphate 
metabolism after liver Tx in childhood have not been found 
(9). Height at Tx has been found to correlate negatively with 
growth after Tx, which shows that the more growth is retarded, 
thc greater is the potential for catch-up once the child obtains 
a well functioning liver (9). The weight-for-height index at the 
time of Tx may serve as an indicator of the patient's nutritional 
status and correlates positively with subsequent growth (9). 
However, both height and weight-for-height at Tx seem to 
predict growth mainly during the first year after Tx (9). The 
main factors inhibiting long-term growth of these children may 
be poor graft function and/or glucocorticoid-mediated changes 
in the GH-IGF-I axis and growth plate metabolism (9, 10). 
Growth is also often inhibited after renal Tx, and among the 
factors responsible may be reduced GH secretion with in￾creased levels of serum IGFBP-3 (11). To investigate whether 
similar abnormalities are present and responsible for the 
growth inhibition in children with liver transplants, we studied 
the relations of GH secretion, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum

concentrations, immunosuppressive medication, and endoge￾nous cortisol production to growth in 18 prepubertal children 
followed for more than 1 y after liver Tx. 
METHODS 
Subjects. Between October 1987 and August 1993, 37 liver 
Txs were performed on 31 children at the Children's Hospital, 
University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. First-year patient 
survival was 79.3%, and graft survival was 60.7%. Only 
prepubertal patients followed for more than 1 y after Tx are 
reported in the present study (n = 18, 11 boys and 7 girls). 
Twelve of these received a reduced size liver and two patients 
an ABO-incompatible graft. Mean age at Tx was 3.1 y (range 
0.4 to 10.8 y). The indications for Tx were: hereditary tyrosine￾mia (n = 8), biliary atresia (n = 5), hepatoblastoma (n = 3), 
cirrhosis (n = I), and a,-antitrypsin deficiency (n = 1). Mean 
follow-up time was 29 mo (range 12 to 60 mo). 
Immunosuppression. CyA, 5 mglkg p.o., was given preop￾eratively. MP, 100 mg i.v., and AZA, 1.4 mglkg i.v. in two 
doses, were given intraoperatively. Postoperative immunosup￾pression included MP, 3 mglkgld p.o., which was tapered down 
to 0.25 mglkg at 1 mo, and to 0.37 mglkg every other day after 
6 mo if the clinical condition was stable. Eighteen and 36 mo 
after the Tx, 88% of the patients were on alternate-day steroids; 
AZA, 2 mglkgld p.o., which was reduced to 1 mglkgld after 2 
wk and increased to 1.4 mglkgld at 6 mo when the MP dose 
was reduced; CyA, given as a continuous i.v. infusion for the 
first 2 wk, aiming at a blood trough concentration of 500 pg/L 
(specific monoclonal RIA, Sandimmun Kit, Sandoz, Basel, 
Switzerland). After 2 wk, the patients were switched to peroral 
CyA three times a day, aiming at a blood trough concentration 
of 300 to 500 pg/L. The dose was slowly reduced to maintain 
a concentration between 100 and 200 pg1L after 1 y. In the first 
nine patients, AZA was given only for the first 2-6 mo after 
Tx. In 1991, we started triple immunosuppression, and AZA 
has been added to the medication of most of the older patients. 
The doses of the immunosuppressive medication are expressed 
as mglkg, to be comparable with those reported in most 
previous studies (6, 7). 
Complications. Acute rejection episodes were documented 
in 16 of the 18 patients studied. Ten patients had one, five 
patients two, and one patient three rejection episodes. Most 
rejections occurred during the first postoperative month except 
in three patients who underwent two rejection episodes, one 
shortly after Tx, and the second 3, 6, or 18 mo after Tx. All 
rejections wcre treated with MP 1.5 mg/kg p.o., followed by 3 
mg/kg/d p.0. for 5 d. The dose was then tapered back down in 
1 wk. 
Major complications in the 18 patients studied were: 1) 
vanishing bile duct syndrome in three patients (all have been 
retransplanted, one died postoperatively in sepsis); 2) Burkitt's 
lymphoma after Epstein-Barr virus infection in one patient 
(responded to one cycle of cytostatic treatment and radiother￾apy after AZA and CyA had been stopped); 3) occlusion of the 
hepatic artery 8 mo after Tx, and a liver abscess after 18 mo 
(Aspergillus jlavus; responded to liposomal amphotericin B 
and peroral itraconazole) in one patient; and 4) familial pol￾yposis of the colon in one patient (panproctocolectomy and 
ileostomy performed 20 mo after Tx). 
Follow-up visits. After Tx, all of the 18 patients studied 
were seen regularly at the local hospital and at our outpatient 
clinic every 3 mo for the first year, and subsequently every 6 
mo. The following laboratory data were obtained: total blood 
count and thromboplastin time, lidocair~e test (12), GFR (51~r￾EDTA-clearance), blood specific CyA, serum alanine amino￾transferase, y-glutamyl transferase, albumin, prealbumin, total 
and conjugated bilirubin, creatinine, and urea nitrogen concen￾tration. The laboratory analyses were performed by routine 
methods. 
Auxologic measurements. Height and weight determina￾tions were performed at noon by the :same trained observers 
using a Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain LTD., Crymych, Dy￾fed, UK) for height measurements. Bone age determinations, 
performed in 13 patients, were done by the same observer 
according to the Tanner-Whitehouse 2 (20 bones) method (13). 
Nocturnal GH secretion. Measurement of nocturnal 8-h GH 
secretion was added to our follow-up protocol in 1990 and 
performed 12 mo after Tx. In addition, nocturnal GH secretion 
was measured in some of the older patients already followed 
for more than 12 mo. Thus, the measurements were performed 
in 11 patients 12 mo, in three patients 24 mo, and in one patient 
36 mo after Tx. Blood samples were collected from 2200 to 
0600 h at 20-min intervals. Serum GH concentration was 
measured by monoclonal immunoradiometric assay, using a 
commercially available kit (C.I.S., Gif-sur-Yvette, Cedex, 
France). The GH results of our MAb assay were compared 
with other GH assays, and a strong correlation (r = 0.996) was 
found with the results of the polyclonal antibody assay sup￾plied by Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden. 
GH measurements were analyzed using a personal computer 
version of the Pulsar peak analysis program with the settings 
G1 3.98, G2 2.4, G3 1.680, G4 1.240, and G5 0.93 times our 
interassay SD as criteria for accepting peaks (14). Obtaining 
control data from healthy children was considered unethical, 
and the results were compared with control data of the 8-h 
overnight GH secretion from the literalure (8). 
Stimulation tests. Serum GH concentrations after stimula￾tion were measured in 11 patients at 6 mo, in 12 at 12 mo, in 
six at 24 mo, and in four at 36 mo after Tx. GH secretion was 
stimulated using peroral clonidine andlor insulin-induced hy￾poglycemia followed by arginine infusion. 
The clonidine test (mainly used at the time) was performed 
on seven patients 6 mo after Tx, using peroral clonidine 75 
pg/rn2 (Catapresan, Bochringer Mannheim, Germany). Blood 
samples were collected at 30-min intervals for 2 h. 
The insulin-arginine test performed in the other patients was 
followed by a rapid ACTH test to evaluate the endogenous 
cortisol production induced by hypoglycemia and ACTH. The 
test was performed in the morning before the medication was 
taken. Each patient had fasted 10 h before the test. The test was 
started before 0900 h when a basal blood sample was collected 
for serum cortisol and GH measurements. Cortisol was mea￾sured using a commercial RIA kit (Farmos Diagnostics, Turku, 
Finland). After the basal GH and cortisol samples, 4 1u/m2 i.v. 
of insulin was injected and the blood glucose concentration 

368 SARNA ET AL. 
was measured after 20 min. Hypoglycemia was defined as a 
blood glucose concentration <2 mmol/L. Blood samples were 
collected 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the insulin injection for 
cortisol and GH measurements. Samples for serum cortisol 
measurements were collected additionally 180 and 240 min 
after the insulin. L-Arginine 5 g i.v. was infused after the 
60-min sample and 0.25 md1.73 m2 i.v. of synthetic ACTH 
(S-Cortrophin, Organon, Oss, Netherlands) was injected after 
the 120-min sample. We have previously shown that the results 
of an ACTH test after insulin-arginine administration are valid 
(15). In a few patients, stimulated cortisol secretion was eval￾uated only by the rapid ACTH test. 
GH secretion was considered subnormal when the highest 
serum GH concentration after stimulation was <10 pg/L in 
two stimulation tests. Cortisol secretion was considered sub￾normal when the basal serum cortisol concentration was <200 
nmol/L, and the highest concentration after stimulation <400 
nmolIL, or less than twice the basal concentration. 
ZGF-Z and ZGFBP-3 measurements. All measurements 
were performed in the morning after an overnight fast. IGF-I 
was measured in 14 patients at 12, in six at 24, and in nine at 
36 mo after Tx using RIA (ImmunoNuclear Corp., Stillwater, 
MN). In this assay serum samples were incubated in a buffer 
containing heparin, known to release IGF-I from its binding 
proteins and prevent reassociation of the complexes (16). 
IGFBP-3 measurements were performed in five patients 12 
mo, in five 24 mo, and in six 36 mo after Tx. In the IGFBP-3 
immunofluorometric assay (17), MAb F42-1B6 was bound to 
microtiter wells, and the second antibody F41-5Cll was la￾beled with europium chelate. Neither assay cross-reacts with 
other IGFBPs or IGFs. Control values of serum IGFBP-3 have 
been determined previously (16), and in this study the serum 
IGF-I control values were measured from the same samples (n 
= 135 for IGF-I and n = 139 for IGFBP-3). The IGF-I and 
IGFBP-3 data are age-adjusted, as all patients were prepuber￾tal, and there were no sex differences in this age group. 
Data analyses. Height SD score (hSDS) was calculated 
according to the following equation: hSDS = (observed value 
- mean value)/SD (SD represents the SD for the normal 
population of the same chronologic age and gender) (18). 
Growth velocity was defined as the annual change in hSDS 
(ASDS). Growth velocity was correlated with various labora￾tory measurements, and ASDS was calculated from height 
measurements performed 6 mo before and after each measure￾ment. The weight-for-height index, expressed as a percentage, 
was determined from the ratio of weight (kg) to height (cm), 
and the ratio of the 50th percentile weight for age to the 50th 
percentile height for age (19). 
For more exact determination of the MP dosage of each 
patient a weighted average was calculated as follows. Average 
MP dose between follow-up visits = C(duration of the dose (d) 
X dose for weight)/time between follow-up visits (days). The 
average weight (kg) for each period was calculated from the 
weight measurements at the follow-up visits. 
The associations between the different variables was tested 
using the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (r,). 
Because of the nature of our follow-up protocol, the various 
measurements were performed at different times after Tx. 
Thus, the effect of time as a confounding variable was tested 
using the Kendall partial rank-order correlation coefficient (7) 
and is reported if a significant effect was found. Correlations 
were considered significant with the p value <0.05. 
RESULTS 
Growth. Growth before and after liver Tx is presented in 
Figure 1 and with the demographic data in Table 1. Median 
height at Tx was -1.3 SD. Median ASDS was -0.77 SD 
during the first, -0.12 SD during the second, and 0.18 SD 
during the third year after Tx. Three years after Tx, 618 
children were <2 SDs for height (at Tx 418 of these children 
were already <2 SD for height). In the patients without major 
complications, growth velocity was reduced in 83% during the 
first, in 31% during the second, and in 25% during the third 
year after Tx. Growth velocity correlated positively (r, = 0.46, 
p < 0.001) with time elapsed after Tx. 
The nutritional status of all patients was good and weight￾for-height remained normal in all but three patients (patients 9, 
12, and 17), whose weights increased above the normal range 
12, 36, and 24 mo after Tx, respectively. In 62% of the patients 
bone age was delayed by more than 1 y in relation to chrono￾logic age. 
GH, ZGF-I, and ZGFBP-3. The normal pulsatile character 
of nocturnal GH secretion was sustained in all patients studied. 
Table 2 gives various parameters of the Pulsar analysis. Only 
two patients had a mean GH concentration below 3.0 pg/L, and 
in one of them the GH response to stimulation was also 
reduced (patient 9). The GH response was subnormal in 2 of 17 
patients after Tx. However, both patients were growing nor￾mally at the time of the measurements. Neither the parameters 
of the Pulsar analysis nor the peak GH response to stimulation 
correlated significantly with growth velocity. 
None of the patients had a low serum IGF-I concentration 
after Tx. The median IGF-I concentration was -0.3 SD at 12 
mo, 0.2 SD at 24 mo, and 0.2 SD at 36 mo after Tx. Serum 
IGF-I concentration did not correlate significantly with growth 
velocity.

The median serum IGFBP-3 concentration was 0.9 SD at 12 
mo, 1.7 SD at 24 mo, and 1.3 SD at 36 mo after Tx. Serum 
IGFBP-3 concentration was elevated in three patients and low 
in one (Fig. 2). One patient with elevated serum IGFBP-3 had 
a subnormal GFR (EDTA clearance: 48.0 mLlminl1.73 m2). 
His growth velocity was also markedly reduced and hSDS 
-5.4 2 y after Tx. The GFR were normal in the other patients. 
The low serum IGFBP-3 concentration in one patient was 
growth velocity when these time period:; were pooled together 
(Fig. 3). However, this correlation was clearly confounded by 
time elapsed after Tx, and after controlling the effect of time no 
correlation was found. AZA dose or blood CyA concentration 
at the follow-up visit did not correlate significantly with growth 
velocity. Nor was there a correlation between growth velocity 
and the cumulative dose of CyA. 
Endogenous cortisol production. During the first year the 
basal serum cortisol concentration was low in 11/15 patients, 
rising to normal later in only two. The stimulated serum 
cortisol concentration was subnormal Iin 10115 patients, and 
later rose to normal in only one. In two patients endogenous 
cortisol production was determined only after the first year. 
One had low basal and stimulated cortisol concentrations (24 
mo after Tx), and the other a normal basal cortisol concentra￾tion but a subnormal response to stimulation (36 1110 after Tx). 
Basal (v, = 0.44, p ' 0.05) and stimulated (r, = 0.53, p < 
0.005) cortisol concentrations correlated positively with growth 
velocity (Fig. 4). As there was some improvement in cortisol 
secretion with time, the correlations were weaker after adjustment 
for the effect of time. In fact, the p value for the correlation 
between basal cortisol and growth velocity became nonsignifi￾cant. There was a weak negative correlation (r, = -0.33, p < 
0.05) between MP dose and basal cortisol concentration.

planted children can be expected to reject their grafts (20). 
Unfortunately, prolonged glucocorticoid treatment often re￾sults in inhibition of linear growth, and the following mecha￾nisms have been proposed (for review, see ref. 21): inhibition 
of pituitary GH secretion, impaired IGF-I production, induc￾tion of IGF-I inhibitors in serum, inhibition of IGF-I action at 
target tissues, and direct inhibition of skeletal matrix produc￾tion. 
Previously, slightly decreased spontaneous and stimulated 
GH secretion, suggested to be caused by glucocorticoid admin￾istration, have been reported in children with liver transplants 
(8). Reduced GH secretion has also been reported in 19 renal 
transplant recipients with severe growth retardation (11). In our 
patients the average of the mean nocturnal GH concentration 
12 mo after Tx (5.3 pg/L) was very close to values previously 
reported for children with liver transplants (5.5 pg/L) found to 
have slightly, but not significantly, lower GH secretion than 
controls (8). Further, a normal GH response to stimulation was 
observed in 88% of our patients. 
Although spontaneous GH secretion has been reported to 
correlate positively with height and growth velocity in healthy 
children (14, 22) and in 19 renal transplant recipients (ll), no 
correlation was found in our patients. Moreover, the peak GH 
response to stimulation did not correlate with growth velocity. 
Taken together, our results suggest that reduced GH secretion 
is not the main factor in the etiology of growth retardation after 
liver Tx. 
IGF-I and -11 are low molecular weight peptides participat￾ing in growth regulation. IGF-I mediates the growth-promoting 
actions of GH at least partly (23), correlating positively with 
height (24), but the physiologic significance of IGF-I1 in 
promoting longitudinal growth has not been established. Serum 
IGF-I levels in children with liver transplants have previously 
been reported to be normal (8). Our results confirm this 
observation, for none of our patients had low serum IGF-I 
levels. Nor was there any correlation between serum IGF-I 
concentration and growth velocity. However, as IGF-I is be￾lieved to stimulate growth partly in an autocrinelparacrine 
manner, a normal serum concentration does not necessarily 
exclude a low concentration at tissue level (25). Furthermore, 
a decrease in the amount of unbound, biologically active IGF-I 
in serum is also possible. 
In serum, IGF-I and -11 are bound by at least six IGFBP (26). 
Circulating IGFBP-3 binds most of the circulating IGF-I, 
prolongs the half-life of the serum IGF, limits their extravas￾cular transit, and serves as a circulating IGF reservoir. In 
normal children the serum IGFBP-3 concentration has been 
reported to correlate positively with height, GH secretion, and 
serum IGF concentration (24, 27). However, an excess of 
unsaturated IGFBP inhibit IGF-mediated mitogenic and meta￾bolic events in many tissues and cell lines (28). Increased 
serum IGFBP-3 levels have also been reported in 19 severely 
growth-retarded renal transplant recipients with various fol￾low-up times (1 1). 
We found elevated serum IGFBP-3 concentrations in three 
of our patients, and 40% of the other patients had values >1 
SD above the mean for age. Thus, it can be hypothesized that 
relatively elevated levels of IGFBP-3 compared with IGF-I 
may have reduced the amount of unbound, biologically active 
IGF-I in the circulation, so contributing to the growth failure. 
Elevation of the serum IGFBP-3 levels could be caused by 
MP-induced synthesis of IGFBP-3, which has been shown to 
occur in liver extracts (29). In addition to renal transplant 
patients, normal serum IGF-I and elevated serum IGFBP-3 
concentrations have been found in children with chronic renal 
failure, a condition often associated with growth retardation

(11, 30, 31). In these patients the decreased GFR has been 
suggested to cause accumulation of low molecular weight 
IGFBP-3 fragments capable of binding free IGF-I in serum 
(30). All our patients received CyA, a nephrotoxic drug, but 
only one had a clearly reduced GFR, and also an elevated 
IGFBP-3 concentration. In our patients 36 mo after Tx, the 
mean GFR was 119.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (32). Thus, rather than 
reduced renal clearance, the slightly elevated IGFBP-3 levels 
in our patients presumably resulted from prolonged glucocor￾ticoid treatment, as suggested by Tonschoff et al. (33) in renal 
transplant recipients. 
In most studies performed on renal transplant patients, no 
correlation has been found between prednisone dose and 
growth velocity (34, 35). This might be due to individual 
differences in absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the 
drug, making it difficult to predict the magnitude of glucocor￾ticoid-mediated growth inhibition among patients. Accord￾ingly, we found no correlation between the MP dose and 
growth velocity after Tx. However, there was a positive cor￾relation between growth velocity and endogenous cortisol pro￾duction, which was the best indicator of growth inhibition in 
our patients. Thus, at similar doses, corticosteroid sensitivity 
varies from patient to patient. The ACTH test probably reflects 
the sensitivity to corticosteroids. Patients with a high sensitiv￾ity to exogenous corticosteroids may have a low rate of endo￾genous corticosteroid production during MP treatment. This 
may explain why growth velocity is positively correlated with 
adrenal cortisol production and not negatively correlated with 
MP dose in our patients. 
Reduced adrenal cortisol production may indicate not only 
the magnitude of the glucocorticoid-mediated growth inhibi￾tion, but perhaps also of immunosuppression. Thus, if liver
