A BS TR A CT The distribution, blood transport, and
metabolic clearance of physiological concentrations of
antidiuretic hormone were studied in 10 hydrated nor￾mal subjects with radioiodinated arginine vasopressin
('25I-AVP). At 370C no binding of '"I-AVP to plasma
proteins could be demonstrated, but some metabolites
were associated with plasma proteins. "I-AVP was
rapidly distributed into a space approximating the ex￾tracellular fluid volume. Metabolic breakdown products
became demonstrable within minutes after injection.
The mean metabolic clearance rate of 'I-AVP was 4.1
ml/min/kg and the mean plasma half-life 24.1 min.
Renal clearance had a mean value of 80 ml/min and
accounted for 27% of the total metabolic clearance.
It is concluded that in man antidiuretic hormone circu￾lates as a free (non-protein bound) peptide, diffuses
readily into the extracellular fluid space, and is metabo￾lized within minutes. A plasma half-life of 24 min is
consistent with the duration of antidiuresis after hor￾mone administration or release.
INTRODUCTION
Studies of the metabolic fate of circulating vasopressin
(antidiuretic hormone, ADH) 1 have been hindered by
the lack of reliable methods for hormone measurement,
A preliminary report of this work has appeared in Pro￾gram of the 53rd Meeting of the Endocrine Society, No.
250, 1971.

and very rapid metabolism resulting in unsteady test
conditions. Many experiments using bioassay have been
performed in laboratory animals. Some human studies
have been reported, but much of the data remain con￾troversial, mainly due to the low specificity of bioassays
and to species differences (see ref. 1 for review). Radio￾isotopically labeled ADH could overcome some of these
difficulties but only few studies have been reported
heretofore (2-4). The labeled ADH used in these
reports was of low specific activity, which required
administration of supraphysiological quantities of hor￾mone. Only limited data on ADH metabolism from
radioimmunoassays have been reported to date (5-8). In
the present report we have used radioiodinated arginine
vasopressin (AVP) to study the metabolism of ADH in
man at physiological plasma concentrations.
METHODS
AVP peptides. The synthetic AVP used in these studies
was a gift from Sandoz Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. It had a
specific bioactivity of 470 U/mg when assayed against USP
bovine posterior pituitary standard in the ethanol-anesthe￾tized diuretic rat and in the rat pressor assay. On glass
paper chromatography it showed a single component that
co-chromatographed with natural AVP. Natural AVP was
prepared from bovine posterior pituitary powder by the
method of Schally et al. (9) and used as a standard in paper
chromatography and electrophoresis. This material exhibited
a bioactivity of 435 U/mg and was chromatographically
homogeneous. The synthetic AVP used as a fluorimetric
standard was obtained from Schwarz/Mann Div., Becton,
Dickinson & Co., Orangeburg, N. Y., and had a stated po￾tency of over 270 U/mg. It showed two components on
paper chromatography.
Radioiodination and purification. A modification of the
chloramine T method (10) for iodination was used. 2 mCi of
carrier-free 'I as NaI (Cambridge Nuclear Corp., Cam￾bridge, Mass.), 0.1 ml of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4, 1 gsg of synthetic AVP (Sandoz) and 50 /Al of
freshly prepared chloramine T (0.35%) were added to the
reaction vessel. No reducing agent was used. The mixture
was transferred to a column of 1.0 cm diameter containing
2 cm of Dowex 2X8 (Dow Chemical USA, Midland, Mich.)
The Journal of Clinical Investigation Volume 57 May 1976 1109-1116 1109

at the bottom and 23 cm Sephadex G-25 (fine) (Pharmacia
Fine Chemicals, Inc., Piscataway, N. J.) at the top. The
column had been equilibrated with 0.25% acetic acid and
standardized with blue dextran and Na"5I. The same sol￾vent was used for elution.
In parallel experiments, recovery from a similar column
was estimated as follows: 5 ug of AVP (Sandoz) was iodi￾nated and purified by the identical procedure. The peptide
concentration in this preparation was estimated by the fluo￾rescamine reaction (11), with synthetic AVP (Schwarz/
Mann) and bacitracin (Sigma Chemical Co., Inc., St.
Louis, Mo.) as standards. An aliquot containing 1 ,Ag 'I￾AVP was then passed through the column and recovery was
determined on the basis of radioactivity. Recovery was
10.2%.
Purity of the labeled material was established by ascend￾ing chromatography on silicic acid-impregnated glass paper
(ChromAR 500, Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, Mo.) in a
slow and a fast solvent system (n-butanol: acetic acid:
water =8: 2: 3 and 8: 3: 4.5). Unlabeled natural AVP was
used as a standard in all experiments and stained with the
Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. A single radioactive peak was ob￾served with the Rr of unlabeled AVP in both systems (Fig.
1). The material was also subjected to electrophoresis on
Whatman No. 3 paper in acetate buffer, 0.03 M. pH 3.8,
and in phosphate buffer, 0.03 M, pH 6.4. At pH 3.8, the
radioactive peak showed the mobility of AVP. At pH 6.4, a
single radioactive peak was again observed, but it had a
slightly slower mobility than AVP (Fig. 2). This finding
is compatible with the shift of the pK of the phenolic
hydroxyl group from 10.1 to 8.2 with mono-iodination (12).
The material was also compared to the original AVP by dis￾continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a cationic
,8-alanine/acetic acid/KOH buffer system, ionic strength
0.015, operative pH 3.5, 0°C (System 29 [13]), at four dif￾ferent gel concentrations (10, 15, 20, and 30%). Coomassie
brilliant blue G-250 was used for staining. A single band
with a mobility indistinguishable from that of AVP was
found. The retardation coefficient was 0.023, and the relative
free mobility was 0.820 for both peptides (14).

This material was considered to show the properties of
monoiodo-AVP and was stored at 4°C in 0.25% acetic acid.
It proved to be stable under these conditions for several
weeks. Initial specific activities, as estimated from the radio￾activity under the AVP peak and the peptide recovery,
were 334, 364, and 492 mCi/mg in three batches used. Be￾fore each use, the peptide was repurified by passing it over
a Dowex 2X8 column and purity was verified by paper chro￾matography. The solution was then adjusted to pH 5.0 with
NaOH and filtered into a vial containing sterile saline
through a Millipore filter (pore diameter 0.22 sm) (Milli￾pore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). The resulting solution was
shown to be sterile and pyrogen-free.
Subjects and study protocol. 10 normal volunteers who
gave their informed consent (5 men, 5 women, ages 20-29
yr) were studied. The subjects were allowed an ad libitum
breakfast and reclined in a supine position for 1 h before
study. They received 10 drops of saturated potassium iodide
solution to block thyroidal iodine uptake. A 20 ml/kg water
load was given to induce a high urine flow and to suppress
endogenous ADH. 90 min after hydration, 2-7 uCi (9.5-95
ng) 'I-AVP were injected intravenously simultaneously
with or preceded by 5 gCi of 'lI-labeled human serum albu￾min (E. R. Squibb & Sons, Princeton, N. J.), the latter to
measure plasma volume and "mixing time". Blood was
drawn from the opposite antecubital vein through an in￾dwelling catheter into heparinized plastic syringes at fre￾quent intervals for 60 min after the injection. Total blood
loss was 90 ml. Blood samples for AVP isolation were
chilled immediately to 0°C and processed as described below.
Voided urine samples were collected at 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60
min.
Assays. A dual-channel gamma spectrometer was used
for radioactive counting. All samples were counted to an
error of less than 2%o. 2-ml aliquots of plasma and urine
were counted; blood cells were counted after washing with
normal saline. Urinary osmolality (Uo.m) was determined
by freezing point depression.

Binding of 1'I-AVP to plasma proteins in vitro was
studied by gel chromatography. To 1-ml aliquots of plasma
from a hydrated subject 5 pg of 'I-AVP was added with
or without the addition of 500 KIU of bovine kallikrein￾trypsin inhibitor (Trasylol, Bayer, Leverkusen, W. Ger￾many). Unlabeled AVP was added to parallel samples in
amounts of 0, 20, 200, and 2,000 pg. Gel chromatography was
then immediately carried out on a 13 X 0.9-cm Sephadex
G-15 column at 370 C. The column had been equilibrated
and was eluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with
or without addition of Trasylol (500 KIU/ml). Flow rate
was 1 ml/min. In vivo binding of isotope to plasma pro￾teins was measured in the blood samples obtained after
injection by the dextran-coated charcoal method (15). A
suspension of 100 mg/ml charcoal (Norit A, Fisher Scien￾tific Co.. Pittsburgh, Pa.) and 10 mg/ml dextran (Schwarz/
Mann clinical grade) was prepared in 0.05 M phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4. 1 ml of this suspension was mixed with 1 ml
of plasma at 4VC, incubated at 4VC for 10 min, and cen￾trifuged. Radioactivity in the pellet and supernate was de￾termined.
In search of AVP breakdown products, radiochromatog￾raphy was performed on unextracted urine and on plasma
extracts. Urine samples collected from 0 to 10, 10 to 20, 20
to 30, 30 to 45, and 45 to 60 min after injection were chro￾matographed in one of the systems described above (n￾butanol: acetic acid: water = 8: 2: 3). The radiochromato￾grams were cut into 10-mm-wide strips and counted. For
the characterization of radioactive material in blood, samples
obtained at 6, 12, 16, and 20 min after injection were ex￾tracted as follows: Blood was chilled to 0C immediately
after withdrawal and centrifuged at 4VC within 10 min. The
plasma proteins were precipitated with 2 vol of 10% tri￾chloroacetic acid. The supernate containing 'I-AVP was
extracted twice with diethyl ether to remove trichloroacetic
acid, evaporated to a small volume, and chromatographed
as described.
Calculations. Plasma radioactivity disappearance curves
based on the chromatographically intact fraction of 'I-AVP
were fitted over the range from 6 to 20 min in each study
by least squares after logarithmic transformation of the
ordinate. From these a mean disappearance curve was cal￾culated. The chromatographically intact 'I-AVP was di￾rectly measured in sample withdrawn at 6, 12, 16, and 20
min and estimated by interpolation at the other time points.
Apparent volume of distribution (Va) of 'tI-AVP was de￾termined by extrapolation of the slope (k) to zero time.
Plasma volume was calculated from isotope dilution of the
'I-labeled albumin. Maximal initial plasma concentration of
'I-AVP was calculated as the dose administered divided
by the plasma volume. Approximate renal clearance was
calculated as total radioactivity excreted divided by the mean
plasma radioactivity concentration during the collection
period. Metabolic clearance rates (MCR) were calculated
as the apparent volume of distribution times the slope of
plasma disappearance.
RESULTS
Effect of 13I-A VP on urinary flow and osmolality.
The 'I-AVP in doses from 9.5 to 25 ng had no de￾tectable antidiuretic action in six subjects, with urine
flow ranging from-7 to 15 ml/min and U.m. remaining
below 100 mosmol/kg. One woman given 19 ng had an
initial urine flow of 1.0 ml/min and a Uosm above 600
mosmol/kg that persisted for the 1-h period of observa￾tion. Because of technical problems, blood was obtained
from this subject only with great difficulty, which re￾sulted in considerable pain and stress. One male subject
who showed marked apprehension was unable to void
until 25 min after the injection; the urine passed at
that time had a U.m. of 82 mosmol/kg. The female sub￾ject who received 95 ng showed a fall in urine flow
from 16 to 3.5 ml/min with a concomitant increase in
U..m from 87 to 270 mosmol/kg over a 10-min period
after the injection. In this subject urine osmolality
reached a peak value at 30 min after injection (336
mosmol/kg) and fell thereafter to 260 mosmol/kg at 60
min.
Distribution of '"I-A VP. The individual data are
summarized in Table I. The -plasma radioactive dis￾appearance curve of chromatographically intact 'SI￾AVP followed an at least double exponential function,
with a single exponential component from 10 to 20 min
(Fig. 3). Mixing time after injection, as indicated by
stabilization of plasma 'I concentration, ranged from
4 to 6 min.
The apparent distribution volume of 'I-AVP had a
mean value of 9,940 ml, or 140.8 ml/kg body wt. Plasma
volume averaged 3,511 ml or 48.9 ml/kg.
Blood cells did not bind either isotope during the
first 20 min after injection. No measurements were
made thereafter.
Initial plasma concentrations of 'I-AVP were within
those seen under physiological conditions (5-7, 16-18)
(Table I).

vitro are shown in Fig. 4. No evidence for specific bind￾ing of intact 1`I-AVP to plasma proteins was found.
The radioactivity present in the macromolecular frac￾tions was not displaceable by addition of up to 400-fold
excess of unlabeled AVP. Trasylol appeared to inhibit
enzymatic breakdown of AVP in plasma substantially
during the 15 min required for gel filtration, although
some residual enzymatic activity remained. AVP metab￾olites appeared to be at least partially bound to plasma
proteins, as demonstrated by the greater amount of
radioactivity present in the macromolecular fractions in
the absence of the protease inhibitor (Fig. 4, Table II).
Protein binding of isotope in vivo, as determined by
charcoal, gradually increased from 23% at 4 min to 40%
at 60 min. Over 90% of the '51I injected remained pro￾tein-bound throughout the study period.
Metabolic breakdown. 'I-AVP appeared in the
urine within the first 10 min, whereas 'I-albumin was
not excreted in the urine during the period of study.
Chromatography of the urinary material showed only
intact `JI-AVP in four of eight subjects during the
first 10 min after injection. In the remainder, less than
15% of the radioactive compounds found were break￾TABLE II

down products. Between 10 and 20 min radioactive
compounds other than AVP became detectable in all
subjects (Fig. 5).
Chromatography of plasma extracts showed an aver￾age of 6% breakdown products at 6 min and 10% at 12
min after injection. At 16 and 20 min detectable radio￾active compounds other than 1"I-AVP had risen to 13
and 16%, respectively (Fig. 6). No radioactivity was
found in the ether extract of the plasma in any instance.
The 24-h urinary excretion of 'I ranged from 78 to
100%.
Clearance. MCR of intact 'I-AVP, based on the
slope of the plasma disappearance curve between 10
and 20 min, had a mean value of 4.14 ml/min/kg. The
mean half-life of 'I-AVP, derived from the same sec￾tion of the disappearance curve, was 24.1 min, and the
fractional disappearance rate was 0.0288 min- (Table
I).
Renal clearance of "2I within the first 10 min after
injection ranged from 36.6 to 118 ml/min (mean 80
ml/min). One subject showed a very low initial isotope
excretion with a urinary clearance of only 6 ml/min.
These values can only be rough estimates since they
are based on voided urine samples and on crude ap￾proximation of a "mean" plasma concentration during
the distribution phase.
DISCUSSION
The use of 'I-AVP has enabled us to make multiple
measurements with relative ease and with far greater
accuracy than can be obtained with bioassays. Bioassays
and specific immunoassays, however, measure only the
intact hormone, while the present method includes any

possible radioactive metabolites. -Examination of meta￾bolic breakdown is therefore important before any con￾clusions can be drawn. Our data show that radioactive
breakdown products appear within minutes after in￾jection.
The purity of the 'I-AVP used was established by
showing homogeneity and chemical behavior similar to
AVP in six different systems. The preparation appeared
to be biologically active, as judged by the antidiuretic
response of the subject who received a sufficient dose
of peptide (F. W.). Whether this antidiuretic activity
was due to the iodinated hormone or to the presence of
unlabeled hormone in the preparation cannot be deter￾mined from the present data.
In contrast to numerous distribution studies with un￾labeled vasopressin with bioassay, only few with radio￾active hormone have been reported. Silver et al. (2)
and Sjoholm and Ryden (3) used tritiated and iodinated
vasopressin in distribution studies in dogs, rats, and
man. Their preparations had low specific activities rang￾ing from 0.4 to 2.4 mCi/mg, with the result that un￾physiologically high peptide doses were administered

A constant infusion technique to achieve steady-state
VP conditions would have been preferable to the transient-

only be achieved by a high infusion rate. Since our

radioactive iodine required to attain a steady-state
precluded this approach.
Objections against the use of iodinated hormones as
representatives for native hormones can be raised on
the basis of their chemical difference. Identical metabo￾lism of iodo-derivatives and original hormones have
been shown for larger protein hormones, such as human
growth hormone (19). Little information on the effect
of iodination on the metabolism of small peptide hor￾mones is available. Klein and Roth (4) reported differ￾ences between the metabolism of iodo-AVP and AVP,
but subsequently their anti-AVP antibody was shown to
lack specificity (20). More studies are needed to clarify
the effect of iodination on action and metabolism of
small peptide hormones. The preservation of molecular
integrity, as judged by retention of biological activity,
appears to be more related to the conditions of iodina￾tion than to the incorporation of an iodine atom. Thus,
Fong et al. (21) reported that iodo-AVP was only
1/100 as active as AVP, while Thompson et al. (22),
using milder iodination conditions, found 80% of the
bioactivity retained in iodo-oxytocin. The fact that our
preparation was biologically active-although not prov￾ing activity of the iodinated species-and the agreement
of our metabolic data with those obtained by other
methods suggest that the peptide was not profoundly
altered during iodination.
The radioactivity disappearance curve from plasma
followed a double exponential function, with a rapid
distribution component and a slower clearance compo￾nent. Further components appeared beyond 10 min, pre￾sumably reflecting radioactive breakdown products with
different distribution and clearance characteristics.
Elimination of these compounds by chromatography
resulted in a nearly ideal fit to a single exponential
function beyond 10 min (Fig. 3). The first 4-6 min
after injection were-needed for uniform mixing in the
blood, as judged by the stabilization of the 'I-albumin
concentration. The measurements of 'I-AVP at 2 and
4 min after injection were therefore disregarded. The
mean half-life of 24.1 min agrees closely with that
reported for the disappearance of exogenous Pitressin
by Robertson and co-workers (6), using a highly spe￾cific radioimmunoassay for AVP. Beardwell (5) and
Skowsky et al. (7) reported somewhat shorter half￾lives for Pitressin, but their assays did not distinguish
between lysine vasopressin (LVP) and AVP, both of
which are present in Pitressin. The faster disappear￾ance rates in their studies may well reflect more rapid
metabolism of LVP, a "foreign" peptide to man. A
more rapid turnover of LVP than AVP in man has been
demonstrated by indirect methods by Miller et al. (23).
Earlier half-life estimations, using bioassay, have
mostly been performed in the rat and dog (see ref. 1
for review). They cannot be taken as directly repre￾sentative for man. Most experiments in man were done
at supraphysiological plasma concentrations. Schroder
and Rott (24) showed a half-life of 8 min at a plasma
level of 420 /.dU/ml in man. Czaczkes et al. reported
half-lives from 10 to 44 min in normal subjects, de￾pending on hydration (25). Plasma concentrations of
exogenous and endogenous ADH were in the physio￾logical range in their experiments, but bioassays of un￾extracted plasma lack sufficient specificity. More re￾cently Miller et al. published a half-life of 23-25 min,
based on the biological response of the kidney (23).
Using radioactive AVP, Silver et al. (2) reported half￾lives of 3.2 to 6.5 min in two subjects. From the analy￾sis of their disappearance curves it appears that they
chose a very early phase with a rapidly changing slope
for their calculations in addition to administration of
amounts far exceeding physiological doses.
Species differences, inaccuracy of bioassays, insuf￾ficient specificity of immunoassays, turnover differences
between LVP and AVP, different states of hydration,
and varying plasma AVP concentrations could explain
the apparent discrepancies of earlier studies.
The question of binding of ADH to plasma proteins
has been particularly controversial. Data ranging from
complete to no binding have been published (see ref.
1 for review). Ultrafiltration, equilibrium dialysis, gel
chromatography, electrophoresis, and peritoneal dialysis
have been employed to separate bound from free hor￾mone. Since bioassay was used in all these studies, the
question of specificity clouds the interpretation of re￾sults. Our data suggest that intact 1"I-AVP is not bound
appreciably to plasma proteins at physiological concen￾trations at 370C. The significantly greater amount of
radioactivity associated with the protein peak in the
absence of Trasylol suggests that at least some enzymatic
breakdown products of ADH are bound to plasma pro￾teins. Likewise, protein-bound radioactivity in vivo in￾creased gradually with time, an observation consistent
with binding of metabolites to plasma proteins. 'I-AVP
was rapidly distributed into a space equaling the extra￾cellular fluid volume. The molecular size and lack of
protein binding of ADH appear consistent with its rapid
equilibration within the extracellular fluid space.
The MCR of `«I-AVP from blood, ranging from 2.5
to 5.2 ml/min/kg, falls within the range calculated from
other reported data in humans (24, 25).
In eight subjects in whom renal clearance could be
measured, 1I-AVP clearance ranged from 36.6 to 118
ml/min. These clearance calculations were based on
voided urine specimens and "mean" plasma concentra￾tions. The present values for renal clearance are in
close agreement with those reported for hydrated sub￾jects by Robertson, using a specific radioimmunoassay
(8). They are considerably higher than those calculated
in man from conventional bioassay data (see 1 for re￾1114 G. Baumann and J. F. Dingman

view). However, no controlled study of clearance with
bioassay and simultaneous measurement of plasma con￾centrations and renal excretion in man has been re￾ported. The state of hydration may play a role since
our subjects were overhydrated and those of Lee (26)
and Noble and Taylor (27) were dehydrated. Higher
renal clearance has been demonstrated during hydra￾tion (8). Another possible explanation would be the
excretion of ADH inactivated by the kidney, not mea￾sured by bioassay, but recognized by its radioactive
label. Inactivation of AVP has been shown to occur in
rat kidney slices (28) and homogenates (29) as well
as in the perfused kidney, with excretion of inactive
products in the urine (30). Such biologically inactive
metabolites may still react in an immunoassay, depend￾ing on the integrity of the antigenic site. Finally, the
presence of inhibitors and interfering compounds in
unextracted urine or plasma must always be kept in
mind when evaluating bioassay data. From the present
data we conclude that ADH is eliminated principally
by glomerular filtration at physiological concentration,
as previously reported in dogs (31), rats (32), and
rabbits (33). Renal clearance expressed as percentage
of MCR in our subjects, excluding the one with unex￾plained low renal clearance, averaged 27%. Similar
values have been reported at near physiological concen￾trations in dogs (34, 35) and in man (36).
Although little is known about continuity or discon￾tinuity of ADH secretion, daily production rates could be
estimated from our data. Assuming a plasma AVP level
of 1 pg/ml during hydration (6), daily production
could be calculated to range from 0.3 to 0.5 ,ug (or 140-
240 mU) in our subjects under hydrated conditions.
The present study of the metabolic fate of ADH in
man suggests certain modifications of concepts derived
from animal experiments and bioassay methods of low
specificity. If the behavior of exogenous 'I-AVP can
be extrapolated to endogenous AVP, it may be con￾cluded that circulating ADH is not bound to plasma
proteins. ADH diffuses readily into a space approxi￾mating the extracellular fluid volume, it has a plasma
half-life of about 24 min, and its urinary clearance
accounts for about one-fourth of the total metabolic
clearance. Metabolic breakdown of ADH occurs within
a few minutes, is partially intravascular, and results in
metabolites which are rapidly eliminated. A half-life of
24 min appears more consistent with the duration of the
antidiuretic action of ADH than the shorter half-lives
previously reported.
