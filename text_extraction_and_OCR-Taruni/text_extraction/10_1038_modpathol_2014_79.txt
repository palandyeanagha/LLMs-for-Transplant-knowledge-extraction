Chronic right heart failure predisposes to hepatic passive congestion and centrizonal necrosis that may lead to
hepatic fibrosis (cardiac sclerosis). Although there have been several studies on the histologic features of
congestive hepatopathy, there is no available grading system. In this study we developed a novel grading
system for congestive hepatic fibrosis. Liver biopsies were examined in patients with chronic heart failure of
various etiologies including congenital heart disease, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, and
valvular heart disease. The cases with available echocardiography and/or right heart catheterization were
included. Cases with other types of underlying chronic liver diseases, alcoholic liver disease, significant
steatosis (420%), malignant neoplasm, and acute heart failure or shock were excluded. After exclusion, 42
cases were included in the study. We herein proposed a novel congestive hepatic fibrosis score and correlated
it with the right heart structure and function obtained by echocardiography and/or right heart catheterization.
Our results showed that congestive hepatic fibrosis score is well correlated with the right atrial pressure (P for
trend o0.001). The presence of portal fibrosis (congestive hepatic fibrosis scores 2 and 3) is associated with
significantly higher right atrial pressure than those with no fibrosis (Po0.001) or with centrizonal fibrosis only
(P ¼ 0.02). Congestive hepatic fibrosis score is also significantly associated with increasing severity of right
atrial dilatation (P ¼ 0.03) and right ventricular dilatation (P ¼ 0.02), indicators for chronic volume and/or
pressure overload. Other histopathologic features include sinusoidal dilatation and centrizonal hepatocyte
atrophy. In summary, although sinusoidal dilatation and centrizonal fibrosis are the hallmarks of hepatic
passive congestion, the presence of portal fibrosis is suggestive of more advanced disease, as it correlates
with more severe impairment of right heart function, regardless of the etiologies of right heart failure.
Congestive hepatic fibrosis score is a useful indicator of clinical severity.

Liver pathology in patients with congestive heart
failure has been recognized for decades. The histo￾pathology of cardiac hepatopathy or ‘nutmeg liver’
was initially described in liver necropsy specimens
by Sherlock1 in 1951, whose salient observations
included sinusoidal dilatation and centrilobular
hepatic necrosis. Several studies have since con￾firmed and further characterized these histologic
findings in post-mortem liver specimens from
patients with various cardiac diseases or shock,
including centrilobular congestion, with or without
necrosis, inflammation, sclerosis, and regenerative
hyperplasia.2–4 The progression to advanced-stage
disease (cardiac cirrhosis), however, remains rare,
despite the common manifestation of centrilobular
fibrosis.2,5 In one pertinent autopsy series, centri￾lobular congestion was closely associated with
clinical conditions that present as elevated central
venous pressure, whereas centrilobular necrosis
often occurred in the setting of shock.3 Although
hemodynamic derangement induces cardiac hepato￾pathy, very few studies have correlated hemodyna￾mic parameters with histological findings. In one
such analysis, Myers et al5 reported that elevated
right atrial pressure and hepatic venous pressure
were associated with the presence of centrilobular
necrosis, inflammation, and sinusoidal dilatation,
but surprisingly, not with hepatic fibrosis. Because
the latter observations raise concerns about the
reproducibility of histopathologic observations in
cardiac hepatopathy, we believe that ongoing

investigations of this condition, including meta￾analyses of existing studies, would be aided by a
robust histologic scoring system.
In the current study, we propose a simplified histo￾logic scoring system for congestive hepatopathy—
what we will refer to as the congestive hepatic fibrosis
score—that may serve as a clinically useful indicator
of the severity of congestive hepatopathy. Our find￾ings demonstrate that the congestive hepatic fibrosis
score correlates well with echocardiographic and
hemodynamic parameters.
Materials and methods
Patient Selection
We searched the University of Washington Medical
Center Pathology database to identify patients with
liver biopsies between 2003 and 2012 who met the
specific keywords of either ‘heart disease,’ ‘heart
failure,’ or ‘cardiomyopathy.’ The 64 patients meeting
these search parameters were filtered using a specific
inclusion criterion: the availability of complete
echocardiographic studies within 4 months of the
date of liver biopsy; and several exclusion criteria
were used: (1) viral or alcoholic hepatitis, (2)
transplanted liver, (3) malignancy, (4) steatosis
420% of hepatocytes, regardless of the etiology, (5)
clinical demonstration (or documented suspicion) of
shock, and (6) biopsies with length o1.5 cm. A total
of 54 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 8
were excluded: 3 had viral/alcoholic hepatitis, 3 had
significant steatosis, and 2 had malignancy. There
were 42 patients available for final analysis.
Clinical, Echocardiographic, and Cardiac
Catheterization Data
All clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and cardi￾ac catheterization data analyzed in this study were
obtained from electronic medical records of our
institution. Echocardiographic data included left
ventricular ejection fraction, echocardiographic diag￾nosis, estimated right atrial pressure, and the degree
of right atrial and right ventricular dilatation. For
cardiac catheterization, we included the mean right
atrial pressure data from right heart catheterization
studies performed within 4 months of the echocardio￾graphy. Concurrent liver tests included serum aspar￾tate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), total alkaline phosphate (ALP), g-glutamyl
transferase (GGT), and total and direct bilirubin.
Congestive Hepatic Fibrosis Score and Histopathologic
Examination
We designed a simplified congestive hepatic fibrosis
score based on prior literature review2,3,5 and 9 index
autopsy cases (2011–2012) that met the afore￾mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based
on the pattern of fibrosis, scores of 0, 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and
4 may be assigned as follows: score 0, no fibrosis;
score 1, central fibrosis; score 2A, central zone and
portal fibrosis, with accentuation of fibrosis in the
central zone; score 2B, moderate portal fibrosis and
central zone fibrosis, with accentuation of fibrosis in
the portal zone; score 3, bridging fibrosis; score 4,
cirrhosis (see also Table 1 and Figure 1). Figure 2
presents examples of the congestive hepatic fibrosis
score using a Masson trichrome stain.
For histopathologic data collection, archived
hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome￾stained sections of liver biopsy samples from each
patient were evaluated.
The adequacy of the biopsy specimen is defined as
biopsy length of at least 1.5 cm. All cases that were
analyzed meet these criteria. Biopsies were evaluated
for sinusoidal dilatation and hepatocyte atrophy, and
were assigned a consensus congestive hepatic fibrosis
score by two pathologists (MMY and PES) who were
blinded to clinical and outcome data.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were presented using mean±
s.e.m., and compared using the two-sample t-test
or one-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak post hoc
analysis. Categorical variables were compared using
the w2 test or Fisher’s exact test. Nonparametric test
for trend was applied to investigate the relationship
between the congestive hepatic fibrosis score and
the right atrial pressure. The P-values of o0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using Stata IC version 10
(College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Liver biopsies from 42 patients with heart diseases
met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were
assigned a congestive hepatic fibrosis score. The
demographic data and heart disease status of our
study population stratified by the congestive hepatic
fibrosis score are summarized in Table 2. The mean
age was 51.8±1.8 years, with 29 of 42 patients
(69%) being male. There was no significant differ￾ence in age or gender across different congestive
hepatic fibrosis score groups. Liver tests, including

serum AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and total and direct
bilirubin, were also not significantly different across
congestive hepatic fibrosis score. Similarly, the
indication for liver biopsy (preheart transplant
evaluation, abnormal liver tests, and abnormal liver
imaging (suspected cirrhosis) by ultrasound, CT, or
MRI) was not significantly different across conges￾tive hepatic fibrosis scores. The left ventricular
systolic function as indicated by LV ejection fraction
(overall mean LV ejection fraction of 34.5%±3.6;
reference value: 455%) was not significantly dif￾ferent across congestive hepatic fibrosis score, nor
was the primary underlying cardiac disease (Table 2;
16 patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, 11
with dilated cardiomyopathy, 2 with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, 3 with restrictive cardiomyopathy,
10 with congenital heart disease—including 5 with
transposition of great arteries status after corrective
surgeries, 3 with Ebstein’s anomaly, and 2 with
tricuspid atresia—7 with coronary heart disease and
ischemic cardiomyopathy, 4 with valvular heart
disease, and 5 diagnosed as congestive heart failure
without any specific etiology).
Histologic Findings and Congestive Hepatic Fibrosis
Score
Overall, tissue preservation was adequate in all
biopsies for histologic evaluation. The most striking
finding was the frequency of sinusoidal dilatation and
centrizonal hepatocyte atrophy in the study popu￾lation (Figure 3). Of 37 patients with elevated right
atrial pressure (410 mm Hg), 35 (94.6%) had sinusoi￾dal dilatation and 31 (86.1%) had hepatocyte atrophy.
The correlation of congestive hepatic fibrosis
score with other histopathologic findings is shown
in Table 3. Patients with a congestive hepatic
fibrosis score of at least 1 (ie, any pattern of fibrosis)
had a significantly higher proportion of cases with
hepatocyte atrophy (B89%) compared with those
with a congestive hepatic fibrosis score of 0 (or no
fibrosis, 16%); however, there was no incremental
increase in the proportion of hepatocytes under￾going atrophy with increasing severity of conges￾tive hepatic fibrosis score. There was a suggestion
of increasing sinusoidal dilation with increasing
congestive hepatic fibrosis score, although this did
not reach statistical significance (P ¼ 0.13, Table 3).
Figure 4 illustrates the correlation between con￾gestive hepatic fibrosis score and the severity of
right heart dysfunction. Increasing congestive hepa￾tic fibrosis score is significantly associated with an
increase in right atrial pressure (P for trend o0.001,
Figure 4a). Furthermore, patients with portal fibro￾sis (scores 2–3) have significantly higher right atrial
pressure than those with no fibrosis (score 0) or
those with central fibrosis only (score 1, Figure 4b),
suggesting that portal fibrosis is an indicator
of more advanced disease. Because chronic right
heart pressure or volume overload induces chamber
dilatation, we assessed the relationship between the
congestive hepatic fibrosis score and the severity of

right atrial and ventricular dilation. As shown in
Figures 5a and b, increasing congestive hepatic
fibrosis score is significantly associated with more
severe right atrial and right ventricular dilatation.
As right heart catheterization is the gold standard
for direct measurement of right atrial pressure, we
compared the mean right atrial pressure obtained
by right heart catheterization and pressure esti￾mation by echocardiography using data available
from 18 patients. There was no significant differ￾ence between RA pressure by right heart catheter
measurement and RA pressure estimation by
echocardiography, with a mean difference of 0.33±
1.08 mm Hg.
Discussion
In this study we introduce a histologic fibrosis
grading system for patients with congestive hepato￾pathy. We observe that sinusoidal dilatation, centri￾lobular hepatocyte atrophy, centrilobular fibrosis,
and portal fibrosis correlate with right atrial pres￾sure, whereas higher congestive hepatic fibrosis
scores are associated with right atrial and right
ventricular dilation.
Congestive hepatopathy is a common condition
associated with chronic elevation of right heart
pressure, commonly seen in end-stage heart failure
or after Fontan operation. In patients with severe
heart failure, particularly right heart failure, hepatic
injury results from chronic congestion, with or
without superimposed decline in hepatic arterial
perfusion.6 Although this pathologic entity has been
well known for decades, there has been no useful
grading system for prospective and comparative

studies, resulting in a lack of consistent reporting
parameters for liver histopathology that potentially
hinders the communication of appropriate infor￾mation to the clinicians.
In this study, we have proposed a simple scoring
system—the congestive hepatic fibrosis score—and
have demonstrated that this score correlates well with
echocardiography-derived right atrial pressure as well
as both right atrial and right ventricular dilatation.
Furthermore, the presence of portal fibrosis is
associated with significantly higher right atrial pres￾sure when compared with those without portal
fibrosis (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 1, the conges￾tive hepatic fibrosis score is simple and straight￾forward and the above findings support the validity of
this score as a useful indicator of the severity of
congestive hepatopathy. The application of the con￾gestive hepatic fibrosis score in this study was also a
test of interobserver agreement. The initial indepen￾dent evaluation of test cases by two pathologists
assessed the degree of agreement (in this setting,
62.5%) between one who developed the scoring
system for the purposes of this study and one who
independently reviewed the test material with refer￾ence only to the written scoring criteria without a
training histologic set or representative images. After
review of representative images (including those used
in Figures 1 and 2) and a discussion of scoring criteria
in the context of representative histologic material,
the interobserver agreement reached 92.8%. This
emphasizes the role of appropriate training before
employing this (or any other) histologic scoring
system for prospective or retrospective studies.
Several classical autopsy studies have reported
common histologic findings in post-mortem liver
specimens from patients with cardiac diseases,
including centrilobular congestion, centrilobular
necrosis, inflammation, sclerosis, and regenerative
hyperplasia.2,3 The evaluation of histopathology
in autopsy, however, is often problematic because
of various degrees of post-mortem autolysis
and preservation artifacts. A recent study by Myers
et al5 reported the clinical, hemodynamic, and
histological features of liver biopsies from 83
patients with acute, acute on chronic, or chronic
heart failure. They reported an association between
free hepatic venous pressure and the presence of
centrilobular necrosis, inflammation, periportal
necrosis, and stainable hepatic iron, but not
centrilobular fibrosis. Sinusoidal dilatation was
also associated with higher right atrial and free
hepatic venous pressures.5 It is noteworthy that the
aforementioned studies included a heterogeneous
patient cohort with various cardiac diseases and
shock. In a large autopsy series of 1000 subjects with
cardiac dysfunction, Arcidi et al3 reported that
hepatic centrilobular necrosis often occurred in the
setting of shock, whereas elevated central venous
pressure often manifested as centrilobular conges￾tion. These findings suggest that shock-induced
liver injury and congestive hepatopathy are two
different disease entities that might be best analyzed
separately, as the former predominantly induces
hypoxic cellular injury and necrosis,7 whereas the
latter more likely involves stretch/pressure induced
cell injury.
In patients with complex congenital heart disease
results in a single functional ventricle (including
hypoplastic left or right heart syndrome, and tricuspid
or pulmonary atresia), the Fontan procedure bypasses
the right ventricle via either a right atrium or central
venous to pulmonary artery anastomosis. This results
in chronic central venous hypertension,8 often
420 mm Hg, and places patients at higher risk for
cirrhosis.9 Kendall et al10 reported the results of liver
biopsies from 18 patients after undergoing the Fontan
procedure: all showed marked sinusoidal dilatation
and mild ductular reaction; almost all had at least
some degree of fibrosis, including bridging fibrosis in
14 patients and advanced-stage disease (cirrhosis) in 2
patients. Given the growing number of hepatocellular
carcinoma cases in patients with congestive hepato￾pathy, a good scoring system is necessary for reporting
consistency. Furthermore, congestive hepatic fibrosis
score might be helpful to identify high-risk patients
who need closer follow-up, screening for hepato￾cellular carcinoma, and consideration of heart versus
heart and liver (dual organ) transplantation.
Congestive hepatic fibrosis increases the risk of
postsurgical mortality in heart transplant recipi￾ents.11,12 Therefore, the American Heart Association
Committee on Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplan￾tation recommends that patients with coagulation
abnormalities and aminotransferase levels higher
than twice normal values should not be listed for
heart transplant until the presence of severe liver

associated with greater degree of right atrial (P ¼ 0.033) and

disease has been excluded or the option of heart and
liver transplant is deemed feasible.13 Further study
is needed to elucidate whether congestive hepatic
fibrosis score is useful for preoperative risk strati￾fication to predict coagulopathy or hepatic decom￾pensation in congestive hepatic fibrosis patients
receiving major surgery.
Emerging evidence suggests that hepatic fibrosis
in chronic liver disease may regress following
removal of these insults.14 However, there is only
one case report supporting the reversibility of
congestive hepatic fibrosis after normalization of
increased right heart pressure following heart
transplantation.15 The clinical study of Dichtl
et al16 comprising 56 adult patients receiving heart
transplantation indicated that many of the elevated
liver tests significantly improve within 3 months
after heart transplantation.16 In this setting, conges￾tive hepatic fibrosis score will be useful to assess the
reversibility of hepatic fibrosis following cardiac
transplantation.
Previous reports on pathology of congestive
hepatopathy have emphasized rheumatic heart dis￾ease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our present
study included a diverse group of cardiac diseases,
including idiopathic cardiomyopathy (38%), con￾genital heart disease (24%), ischemic cardiomyo￾pathy (17%), and valvular heart disease (10%). It is
important to note that neither the various etiologies
of heart failure nor the left ventricular ejection frac￾tion seem to correlate with the congestive hepatic
fibrosis score, although this study may not have
adequate sample size to determine whether different
etiologies of heart failure correlate with the con￾gestive hepatic fibrosis score. Nevertheless, our
histopathologic observation demonstrates that sinu￾soidal dilatation, centrilobular hepatocyte atrophy,
centrilobular fibrosis, and portal fibrosis more likely
result from increased right atrial pressure because of
the various causes of right heart failure.
A limitation of this study is the lack of disease￾free survival analysis, an element that limits the
utility of the congestive hepatic fibrosis score for
prognosis. This was not performed for two reasons:
first, the progression of congestive hepatopathy to
advanced cardiac cirrhosis is relatively rare, despite
frequent manifestation of centilobular fibrosis,2,5
as discussed above; second, many of the patients
in our study died of end-stage heart failure before
the development of cardiac cirrhosis. With the
strong confounding effect of heart failure and the
lack of proper end point, the prognostic significance
of the congestive hepatic fibrosis thus remains
unknown. Despite this limitation, our data support
the utilization of congestive hepatic fibrosis score as
an indicator of disease severity.
In conclusion, our study has introduced a novel
and simple histologic grading of hepatic fibrosis
based on trichrome staining. This congestive hepatic
fibrosis score is well correlated with the hemo￾dynamic and echocardiographic parameters that
reflect the severity of heart disease, supporting its
utility as a valuable indicator of disease severity.
