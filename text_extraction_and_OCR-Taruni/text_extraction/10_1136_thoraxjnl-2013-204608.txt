ABSTRACT
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process
when epithelial cells gradually transform into
mesenchymal-like cells losing their epithelial functionality
and characteristics. EMT is thought to be involved in the
pathogenesis of numerous lung diseases ranging from
developmental disorders, fibrotic tissue remodelling to
lung cancer. The most important question—namely
what is the importance and contribution of EMT in the
pathogenesis of several chronic lung conditions (asthma,
COPD, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and lung
fibrosis)—is currently intensely debated. This review
gives a brief insight into the mechanism and assessment
methods of EMT in various pulmonary diseases and
summarises the recent literature highlighting the
controversial experimental data and conclusions.
WHAT IS EPITHELIAL–MESENCHYMAL
TRANSITION?
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a
process in which epithelial cells gradually acquire a
mesenchymal (fibroblast-like) cell phenotype. EMT
has been shown to be essential for embryonic
development, gastrulation, and the development of
the neural crest, heart and other organs. EMT is
also implicated in tissue repair, organ fibrosis and
cancer progression. EMT is associated with the pro￾gression of many type of tumours and is involved
in their metastasis and treatment resistance.1 2
CELLULAR CHANGES IN EMT
During EMT, epithelial cells undergo profound
changes which can be categorised into four broad
cellular functions: changes in transcriptional regula￾tion; changes in cytoskeleton and motility; changes
in cell adhesion; and changes in the synthesis of
extracellular matrix (ECM) components.
Several transcription factors such as Snail, Slug,
ZEB-1, ZEB-2, Twist, β-catenin and Tcf/LEF have
been identified as key regulators of EMT, and are
the ‘master switches’ important for cell reprogram￾ming (figure 1).2–5
Cytokeratins are the characteristic intermediate
filaments in epithelial cells. During EMT cells are
reprogrammed to express vimentin instead.2 5
Other cytoskeletal changes involve de novo expres￾sion of fibroblast specific protein (FSP)-1 (also
called S100A4) in the epithelium, which has been
associated with increased migratory capacity, a
more invasive phenotype in tumours and also
worse prognosis in lung cancer.6 α-Smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA) is also a frequently assessed marker
in EMT. Expression of α-SMA is characteristic for
myofibroblasts which are laying down an excessive
amount of ECM and thus are responsible for tissue
remodelling and fibrosis (figure 1).7
Early molecular signs of EMT involve the dissoci￾ation of cell–cell junctions induced by downregula￾tion and/or disassembly of junctional components,
such as occludins, ZO-1, claudins and E-cadherin.2 5
The gradual loss of E-cadherin—considered a hall￾mark of EMT—is accompanied by the simultaneous
gain of N-cadherin, a mesenchymal marker. This
change is commonly termed the ‘cadherin switch’
(figure 1).5
Cells undergoing EMT also begin to synthesise
ECM components like fibronectin and collagen
type 1.8 9
ASSESSMENT OF EMT IN LUNG TISSUE
EMT is thought to be a gradual process, meaning
that there are intermediate cellular phenotypes
during the transition. An epithelial cell undergoing
EMT will express a set of different marker genes
during this process. Since changes in gene expres￾sion have also been detected during injury, activa￾tion or dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, it is
obviously rather challenging to identify with cer￾tainty epithelial cells undergoing EMT in complex
pathological conditions.
It is well established that during the physiological
repair process following epithelial injury, loosening of
epithelial–epithelial cell contacts (eg, tight junctions
and adherent junctions), alteration of cell–ECM con￾tacts, and cytoskeletal activation (migration) and mor￾phological changes (spreading) occur during wound
repair.10 These phenotypic changes are thought to be
mediated by EMT transcription factors.11 However,
we have to emphasise that during physiological
wound repair mesenchymal markers expressed by epi￾thelial cells do not necessarily mean transdifferentia￾tion to fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. Although
acquiring mesenchymal features and molecular
markers, migrating epithelial cells in wound repair do
not downregulate E-cadherin and tight junction pro￾teins; there is rather an intercellular redistribution of
these proteins.11–13
There are numerous articles demonstrating that
epithelial cells coexpress mesenchymal and epithelial
markers in various lung diseases in humans.14–20
Other methods commonly used to identify EMT are
to show the activation of signalling pathways and
transcription factors thought to regulate EMT. These
mechanisms—for example, the activation of tran￾scription factors of the Snail family and the

consequent downregulation of E-cadherin—show striking similar￾ities between fibrosis, developmental programmes involving EMT
and carcinogenesis, suggesting a common molecular regulatory
background is present.21–23 However, these experimental
methods only provide a ‘snapshot’ of a process stretched over a
period of time and thus are criticised for not being suitable to
follow a dynamic process like EMT. To solve this ongoing contro￾versy there is a need for methods which are able to track the
transdifferentiation process more reliably, like intravital micros￾copy or cell fate mapping.
Currently there are no publications available describing the
use of intravital microscopy to evaluate EMT of lung epithelial
cells in real time. Faulkner et al24 found that kidney interstitial
fibroblasts do not derive from tubular epithelial cells in renal
fibrosis and it was described that activation of intrinsic trans￾forming growth factor β (TGF-β) signalling is essential in blood￾borne metastasis formation in breast cancer cells using in vivo
imaging techniques.25
However, the most important question remaining is whether
EMT causally contributes to lung disease and, if yes, to what
extent? Lung conditions with chronic inflammation and persist￾ent injury result in scarring, fibrosis and tissue remodelling,
leading to a decrease of lung function, respiratory failure and
death. Recently, experiments using genetic cell fate tracking of
lung epithelial cells were performed to address this issue in
mouse models of lung fibrosis9 26 27 and allergic asthma.28
These studies found that approximately 30–50% of murine lung
fibroblasts in lung fibrosis and allergic asthma were derived from
epithelial cells which had undergone EMT as identified by
genetic tagging. In these models, β galactosidase was used as a
genetic label.9 26 27 Criticism of this method highlighted that
the enzymatic reaction using X-gal and β galactosidase does not
allow high-resolution confocal imaging contrary to fluorescent
tags. Because of this, the borders between neighbouring cells are
obscure and the possibility of false-positive identification of cells
cannot be excluded.29 Additionally, these lineage-tracking
studies9 26 27 used transgenic mice in which the recombination
was driven by a 3.7 kb fragment of the human surfactant
protein C (Sftpc) promoter,30 which is somewhat different from
the endogenous murine Sftpc promoter which drives the recom￾bination in other animal models. 29 Also in vitro culture of
alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) after isolation may result in
experimental artefacts, which raises doubt as to whether EMT
actually contributes to in vivo fibroblast formation.8 9 26
Recently published data have challenged the idea that a sig￾nificant fraction of myofibroblasts in the diseased lung derive
from epithelial cells in animal models29 31 and humans.32 These
contradictive results from different laboratories have resulted in
an intensive debate on lung fibrosis, and kidney33 34 and liver
fibrosis.35 Rock et al used a transgenic mouse strain with a
Figure 1 The most important features of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Multiple pathways have been found to trigger EMT: tyrosine
kinase receptors (epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, connective tissue growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like
growth factor, etc), integrins, Wnt, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways. A common feature of these pathways
is that they activate ‘master transcription factors’ (Snail, Slug, Zeb-1, Twist, etc) which switch on the EMT programme in epithelial cells, namely,
downregulating E-cadherin expression and other genes linked to the epithelial phenotype and activating the transcription of genes associated with
the mesenchymal phenotype. Canonical TGF-β/SMAD signalling is perhaps the best characterised signalling pathway which contributes to fibrosis
(for a recent review, see Fernandez et al90). Activation of canonical Wnt signalling and β catenin makes epithelial cells susceptible to EMT caused
by TGF-β, by inhibiting the growth arrest which is induced by TGF-β. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also modulates TGF-β signalling through
integrin signalling contributing to EMT. Inflammatory cytokines activating NF-κB are thought to further accentuate fibrosis and EMT in the lung.

fluorescent protein tag (Tomato) under the control of the
endogenous Sftpc promoter. These experiments suggests that
AECs do not transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts in large
numbers in the bleomycin lung injury model.29 A recently pub￾lished study in mice using multiple genetic tags for cell fate
tracking found that myofibroblasts in unilateral urethral obstruc￾tion (UUO) kidney fibrosis derive from proliferation of local
precursors (50%), bone-marrow-derived fibrocytes (35%),
endothelial-mesenchymal transition (10%) and EMT (5%).34
The study of LeBleu et al34 using the UUO model is a good
example, highlighting the multiple origins of myofibroblasts.
However, it is difficult to extrapolate from the UUO kidney
fibrosis model to the lung as the organ function, the mechanism
of parenchymal injury and consequent fibrotic changes are con￾siderably different.
These controversial data illustrate the ongoing intensive scien￾tific debate on the origin of myofibroblasts in fibrotic diseases
and tissue remodelling. Elucidating this further is crucial to
determine the direction of future research and identification of
new therapeutic targets.
EMT IN LUNG DEVELOPMENT AND PAEDIATRIC DISEASES
The first EMT event described occurs in gastrulation—the earli￾est stage of embryonic development. During this process, the
primary mesenchyme is formed, giving the first distinction
between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. The epithelial
and mesenchymal cell phenotypes are not irreversible, and
during embryonic development, cells can convert between the
epithelial and mesenchymal states through the process of EMT
or mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET).36 37 Sometimes,
several rounds of EMT and MET are required to give a rise to
specialised cell types needed for organ formation. During devel￾opment, EMT provides flexibility in cell fate; however, the
development of specialised tissues during embryogenesis
requires additional epithelial cell plasticity that slightly differs
from classical EMT. Epithelial cell plasticity is essential through￾out the process of branching morphogenesis in numerous
organs, including the lung.38 39 Lung-branching morphogenesis
requires reciprocal signalling between the epithelium and sur￾rounding mesenchyme that is mediated by coordinated activity
of TGF-β/bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt, Sonic hedgehog,
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) or retinoic acid signalling.40
Dysregulation of these signalling pathways is implicated in aber￾rant lung branching, alveologenesis and pulmonary vascular
development, events critical for normal lung development. In
addition to genetic factors, pre-natal and post-natal environmen￾tal exposures, including epigenetics, play a significant role in
programming lung morphogenesis and development of paediat￾ric lung disease.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease
that occurs in very premature infants and is characterised by
impaired alveologenesis and vascular development. BPD devel￾ops as a result of injury or infection on a very immature lung.
Interstitial fibrosis is recognised as a prominent feature of BPD
as a consequence of repetitive lung injury. Deng and coworkers,41
using transgenic reporter mice, showed that lung fibroblasts in
BPD could arise from bone-marrow-derived ATII cells that
have undergone EMT. Noseda and colleagues42 43 revealed
that expression of Notch1 or Notch4 in endothelial cells
can cause transition to a mesenchymal phenotype via
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process very similar to
EMT. Constitutive Notch1 activation, together with inhibitor
studies in lung organ cultures, identified a role for Notch signal￾ling together with TGF-β in mesothelial EMT.44 Que et al45
have also shown that mesothelial cells covering the lung surface
can migrate into the organ itself and give rise to various cell
types, including mesenchymal cells, within the developing lung.
Taken together, these findings have important implications for
our understanding of lung developmental defects; however, the
casual impact of EMT to BPD has yet to be determined.
EMT IN ASTHMA
Airway remodelling comprises thickening of the basement mem￾brane accompanied by sub-epithelial fibrosis, epithelial shedding
and smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia.17 Under normal
conditions, the damaged epithelium is able to repair itself
quickly. However, constant damage inflicted by chronic inflam￾mation in asthma results in a greatly reduced number of ciliated
cells, leaving the basal membrane surface only partially covered
with basal cells which are more resistant to apoptosis.17 Loss of
E-cadherin as a hallmark of EMT in airway epithelial cells of
patients with asthma is also described.14 46 47 Fibroblasts and
myofibroblasts are responsible for the increased production of
ECM proteins, for example, collagen and proteoglycans,
and also serve as storage for cytokines and growth factors
like TGF-β, which play important roles in fibrosis and the regu￾lation of fibroblast–myofibroblast differentiation in inflamed
airways.48 49
Recent experimental data indicate that T helper 2 dominant
chronic inflammation leads to elevated TGF-β1 levels in airways
via increased production of TGF-β by eosinophils and macro￾phages, in addition to fibroblasts, endothelial and smooth
muscle cells. TGF-β is stored in the ECM and in turn induces
EMT and sub-epithelial fibrosis.28
Concerning the pathogenesis of asthma, does EMT contribute
to tissue remodelling and sub-epithelial fibrosis? Johnson and
colleagues28 found evidence for this phenomenon in a house
dust mite (HDM) allergen sensitised transgenic murine model.
They demonstrated that β-galactosidase-tagged large airway epi￾thelial cells gradually lose epithelial characteristics, gain expres￾sion of mesenchymal markers, for example, vimentin, and
migrate into the sub-epithelial compartment.28 In vivo cell-fate
tracking of genetically labelled epithelial cells provides evidence
for epithelial cell transdifferentiation in this mouse model of
chronic asthma. Other studies use primary human bronchial epi￾thelial cell (hBEC) cultures to study the role of allergen sensi￾tisation in EMT. HDM sensitisation of the airways synergises
with TGF-β1 and results in the loss of E-cadherin expression,47
caveolin-1 internalisation and consequent loss of epithelial
barrier function.46 Hackett et al14 investigated EMT using air–
liquid interface cultures of hBECs isolated from patients with
asthma and non-asthmatic controls. The authors found that
basal cells of the stratified airway epithelium are the most sus￾ceptible to TGF-β1-induced EMT. Interestingly, they found no
histological evidence for expression of mesenchymal markers in
the bronchial epithelium of matched patients with asthma,
rather an increased number of cytokeratin-5+ (KRT5+) positive
cells, indicating a differentiation shift towards the basal epithe￾lial cell phenotype.14 The results discussed above highlight the
controversy and discrepancy between research data concerning
EMT.
EMT IN BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS SYNDROME
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a major cause of allo￾graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. Hodge et al15
found increased expression of mesenchymal proteins by large
airway bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) in patients with BOS
after lung transplantation to be a clear indicator of the presence

of EMT. Ward et al50 found that S100A4 and matrix metallo￾proteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9 expression was
present in the airway epithelium of patients who were stable fol￾lowing lung transplant without signs of BOS. Invasive capacity
of BECs isolated from these patients was also shown. It is
known that allograft infections pose a risk for BOS and has
been shown to promote EMT in patient-derived small airway
epithelial cells.51 Inadequate graft microvasculature and conse￾quent graft ischaemia has emerged as a promoting factor for
EMT in transplanted lungs.52 53 Intriguingly, an in vitro study
suggests that commonly used immunosuppressive agents may
promote EMT in BECs.54
EMT IN COPD
COPD is accompanied by inflammation and tissue remodel￾ling,55 and has been known to be strongly associated with lung
cancer. A recent study found a robust genomic link between
COPD, lung cancer and Hedgehog signalling, which is also
implicated in tobacco-smoke-induced EMT.56 Tissue remodel￾ling in COPD is characterised by emphysema, and small airway
remodelling with peribronchiolar fibrosis. Recent investigations
reported that nicotine and tobacco smoke induce EMT in BECs
in a Wnt3a/β-catenin/TGF-β-dependent manner.57 Wang et al58
described that urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is over￾expressed in the airway epithelium of patients with COPD and
is involved in mediating the effects of tobacco smoke on EMT
in BECs. Studies in mice chronically exposed to tobacco smoke
showed increased levels of TGF-β1, connective tissue growth
factor (CTGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B in
the treatment group.59 All these growth factors are known to
induce EMT.2 60 61 Recent clinical investigations in patients
with COPD18 20 showed that cells costaining for epithelial and
mesenchymal markers are present in the large airways of asymp￾tomatic smokers and in especially large numbers in current
smokers. The authors showed that the reticular basement mem￾brane (Rbm) in people who smoke and those with COPD is
highly fragmented, with elongated spaces or cracks termed
‘clefts’, which is a hallmark of EMT in the airways.62 63 These
clefts in the Rbm usually contained cells positive for mesenchy￾mal markers S100A4, vimentin and MMP-9.20 Recent findings
indicate that similar changes can also be observed in the small
(<1 mm) airways of smokers.64
EMT IN IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS
The histological finding characteristic for idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) with scattered
α-SMA-positive fibroblastic foci (FF) in collagen-rich areas,
alternating with normal lung areas. The most often used animal
model for IPF is the single-dose bleomycin challenge, although
it is known that several features of IPF—most importantly being
a progressive and chronic disease—are poorly represented. Also,
many drugs including corticosteroids proved to be effective in
the bleomycin model but are ineffective in IPF.65 A recently
published study suggests that a repetitive bleomycin injury
model recapitulates several features of human IPF better than
the conventional single-dose model. In this model the authors
found that about 50% of S100A4+ fibroblasts are epithelial
derived using genetic fate tracking.27 On the contrary, Rock
et al29 found that epithelial cells do not contribute to fibroblast
formation in the single-dose model.
Human immunohistochemistry studies on the role of EMT in
the formation of myofibroblasts in IPF are controversial.66
Harada et al67 found myofibroblast cells in FF expressing epi￾thelial markers TTF-1, cytokeratin and surfactant protein B.
Chilosi et al68 identified migratory markers laminin5-γ2, heat
shock protein 27 and fascin expression in epithelial cells cluster￾ing above FF in UIP samples with special ‘sandwich morph￾ology’. On the contrary, Yamada et al32 did not find histological
evidence for EMT in tissue samples from patients diagnosed
with IPF (n=15) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (n=12)
using dual immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, the evidence
that EMT is involved in the formation of activated myofibro￾blasts in pulmonary fibrosis remains controversial.
EMT IN LUNG CANCER
EMT is thought to contribute to cancer invasion and metastasis
by allowing malignantly transformed epithelial cells to migrate,
invade the surrounding stroma, and spread through the blood
and lymphatic system to distant sites. Through the process of
EMT, cancer cells not only lose their cell–cell adhesions and
exhibit elevated motility and invasion, but also gain increased
resistance to apoptosis, chemotherapeutic drugs and even
develop stem-cell like properties.69 According to current views,
EMT has prognostic significance in various cancers as it is
highly correlated with invasive phenotype and metastasis￾forming capacity. This so-called ‘EMT phenotype’ is a primary
determinant of prognosis.70 It has been shown in non-small-cell
lung cancer that EMT phenotype is associated with epidermal
growth factor receptor mutations and drug resistance,71 and
also with formation of cancer stem cells.70 In lung cancer, the
circulating tumour cells (CTCs) expressing epithelial marker
EpCAM are lower compared with other solid tumours.72
However, when CTC isolation is not based on epithelial
markers, the CTC numbers are similar to those of other solid
tumours and have strong prognostic value.73 These data suggest
that lung cancer CTCs have lost their epithelial characteristics
having undergone EMT. A recent review suggests that anticancer
and antimetastasis drugs frequently have side effects associated
with defective wound healing, implicating that similar molecular
pathways contribute to these processes.12 However, despite the
growing body of evidence, there is still no direct proof in
humans that EMT actually happens as a dynamic process in
tumour metastasis formation.
WHAT IS THE CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF EMT?
Two disease groups need to be considered concerning the clin￾ical importance of EMT in the lung: conditions with fibrosis
and tissue remodelling, and malignant lung diseases.
It has been recently highlighted that various forms of lung
fibrosis and tissue remodelling are present in all chronic respira￾tory diseases.74 Current research data highlight that we have to
be careful on judging how much EMT contributes to the actual
fibrosis, scarring and tissue remodelling. Among the identified
targets is the TGF-β pathway and other growth factors, like
PDGF, CTGF, FGF and vascular endothelial growth factor,
which are considered to trigger EMT and have a proven patho￾genic role in fibrotic lung diseases.75–78 Most of these molecular
targets have been tested in animal models77 79 80 but there has
been no success so far in translating these findings to the
clinic.81 Pirfenidone is the only licensed therapy for IPF82 but
the mechanism of action is obscure and there are no in vivo
data available of its effects on EMT.
As Wnt signalling pathways have been shown to be important
in the pathogenesis in several lung diseases, such as fibrosis,3
asthma,83 COPD84 and lung cancer,85 they could serve as
another promising therapeutic target. Currently there are mul￾tiple therapeutic approaches targeting Wnt signalling in lung

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we can say that the extent and significance of EMT
in lung diseases is still controversial because of the following
issues:
1. A large majority of studies on EMT in lung diseases use
methods which take only a ‘snapshot’ of this dynamic
process—for example, immunohistochemistry, western blot￾ting or flow cytometry. Although there have been moves to
standardise the molecular markers of EMT,5 33 there are
doubts as to whether EMT can only be defined by the coex￾pression of certain epithelial and mesenchymal markers66
since similar molecular changes occur in epithelial cells
during wound repair.11 12
2. In the case of fibrotic changes, genetic lineage tagging of
cells in animal models is thought to be a reliable method;
however, the results are contradictory in different animal
models for lung fibrosis and other organ fibrosis models.33 It
seems that the results in transgenic mice differ with regards
to the nature of the genetic tag, the method used for its
detection and also the quality of the transgenic construct
used for recombination.
3. A large proportion of the in vivo data on the connection
between fibrosis and EMT have been obtained from the
single-dose pulmonary bleomycin challenge model. This has
received criticism and clearly there is a need for the develop￾ment of a more reliable murine lung fibrosis model that
accurately reflects human UIP.
4. A growing body of evidence supports that EMT has a
pivotal role in malignant transformation, invasion and meta￾static capacity, and in the formation of cancer stem cells. In
lung carcinomas, CTCs seem to have shifted towards a more
mesenchymal phenotype compared with other solid
tumours, suggesting EMT. Hitherto, there is no convincing
direct in vivo evidence of EMT in human tumours, although
suggestions were made about the detection of EMT in
tumours in situ.
89
In conclusion, much recent research has highlighted the
potential of EMT to be involved in lung development and
disease responses. The precise clinical importance of EMT
outside of tumour biology remains to be determined, but the
development of drugs that target growth factors known to
promote EMT suggest that modulation of EMT processes in the
clinical setting may soon be possible. Whether these are clinic￾ally effective remains to be seen.
