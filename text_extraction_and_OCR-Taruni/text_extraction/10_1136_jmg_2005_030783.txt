Background: In both familial and sporadic atypical haemo￾lytic-uraemic syndrome (aHUS), mutations have been
reported in regulators of the alternative complement pathway
including factor H (CFH), membrane cofactor protein (MCP),
and the serine protease factor I (IF). A characteristic feature
of both MCP and CFH associated HUS is reduced penetrance
and variable inheritance; one possible explanation for this is
that functional changes in complement proteins act as
modifiers.
Objective: To examine single nucleotide polymorphisms in
both CFH and MCP genes in two large cohorts of HUS
patients (Newcastle and Paris).
Results: In both cohorts there was an association with HUS
for both CFH and MCP alleles. CFH and MCP haplotypes
were also significantly different in HUS patients compared
with controls.
Conclusions: This study suggests that there are naturally
occurring susceptibility factors in CFH and MCP for the
development of atypical HUS.
Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) is characterised by
the triad of thrombocytopenia, Coomb’s test negative
microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, and acute renal
failure.1 2 HUS is classified as either (D+) when it is
associated with a preceding diarrhoeal illness which in most
is cause by infection with E coli O157 or less commonly as
non-diarrhoeal associated (D2) (also called ‘‘atypical’’, hence
aHUS). aHUS may be sporadic or familial. In both types,
mutations have been reported in regulators of the comple￾ment pathway including factor H (CFH), membrane cofactor
protein (MCP, CD46),3–11 and the serine protease factor I
(IF).12 Such mutations result in impaired protection of host
surfaces against complement activation13 14 and it is likely
that they predispose to rather than directly cause a
thrombotic microangiopathy. In this situation endothelial
activation secondary to injury is maintained by excessive
complement activation.15 A characteristic feature of both
MCP and CFH associated HUS is variable penetrance and
inheritance. The penetrance of the disease phenotype in our
panels of families is approximately 50%. One possible
explanation for this is that functional variants in complement
proteins act as modifiers. In support of this is the finding of
an association between CFH single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and aHUS,16 and a recent study which identified a
specific SNP haplotype block spanning MCP which is over￾represented in aHUS patients.17 To extend these observations
we have examined CFH and MCP SNPs in two cohorts of
aHUS patients.
METHODS
A clinical diagnosis of aHUS was made in all the patients
included in this study. Appropriate ethics approval was given
for both cohorts to be studied and all subjects gave informed
consent. There were 75 patients in the Newcastle cohort and
77 in the Paris cohort, some of whom have been reported
previously.3 5 6 9 11 12 18–24 Of the 75 patients in the Newcastle
cohort there were four families in which more than one
family member was included in the cohort. In three families
there were two siblings included and in one there were three
siblings. Of the 77 patients in the Paris cohort there were
again four families in which more than one family member
was included in the cohort. In three families there were two
siblings included and in one there were three siblings.
In the Newcastle cohort 15 had a CFH mutation, four had
an MCP mutation, and three had an IF mutation; in the Paris
cohort 21 patients had a CFH mutation, eight had an IF
mutation, 10 had an MCP mutation, and one had anti-CFH
antibodies. Of the 21 patients with a CFH mutation, eight had
,50% and three had no detectable antigenic level. Eight
patients had a mutation located in the C-terminal region,
with normal CFH levels. While the functional significance of
each of these mutations has not been examined, their
location would suggest that they act in a way similar to
those previously studied in detail.13 14 Of the 18 patients with
either an FI or MCP mutation, in ,60% there was evidence of
a decreased antigenic level of the protein.
One hundred locally recruited normal controls were
studied for the Newcastle cohort and 84 for the Paris cohort.
Both cohorts and their respective control populations were
predominantly white (Newcastle cohort 65/75; Paris cohort
74/77).
The SNPs analysed in the Newcastle cohort were CFH
(c.2257CRT, promoter; c.2089ARG, synonymous;
c.2881GRT, E963D) and MCP (IVS12+638ARG;
c.2232TRC, 39 UTR). DNA was prepared from peripheral
blood according to standard procedures. Regions of DNA
containing the SNPs of interest were amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Genotyping was carried out through a
primer extension reaction, using the ABI PRISM SNaPshot
ddNTP primer extension kit (Applied Biosystems,
Courtaboeuf, France) and for subsequent detection we
employed an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyser (Applied

PCR products according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
using pooled SNaPshot primers at the concentrations
described in table 1. Primer sequences and conditions for

addition, ambiguous SNPs were verified by direct sequencing
using DYEnamic ET dye terminator cycle sequencing
(Amersham, UK), as described by the manufacturer.

The differences in genotype frequency between HUS
patients in the two cohorts and the respective control
individuals were tested using either
x
2
, or if there were less
than five observations in a cell, Fisher’s exact test. As the
SNPs are not assorting independently it would not be
appropriate to apply a Bonferroni correction equal to the
total number of SNPs studied in each cohort. Haplotype
analysis (FUGUE) showed that there were three CFH and two
MCP haplotypes with a frequency greater than 10% in both
cohorts. We therefore applied a Bonferroni correction of
(0.05/5) giving a significance value of 0.01.
Comparison of haplotypes was undertaken using FUGUE￾CC (Goncalo Abecasis, Center for Statistical Genetics,
University of Michigan, USA). This allows significance to be
computed by analysis of random permutations of the data.
RESULTS
The genotype and allele frequency for the two cohorts is
shown in table 3. In both cohorts there was an association
between CFH alleles and HUS. The same CFH SNPs were
analysed in both cohorts. There was also an association
between MCP alleles and HUS in both cohorts. The results for
the one SNP (c.2232T
RC) analysed in both cohorts showed a
strong association (p
,0.001) in the Paris cohort but failed to
reach a significance value of
,0.01 in the Newcastle cohort
(p = 0.012).
The allele frequency in those with and without known
mutations in CFH
, MCP, and IF is shown in table 4. For CFH
in the Newcastle cohort c.
2257T c.2089G, c.2881T were
associated with atypical HUS in those not known to have a
mutation but not in those known to have a mutation. For
CFH in the Paris cohort c.
2257T c.2089G, c.2881T were
associated with atypical HUS only in those known to have a
mutation. For MCP the association was present in both those
with and those without an identified mutation for all the
SNPs in the Paris cohort. In the Newcastle cohort
c.IVS12
+638A was associated with atypical HUS in those
without a mutation.
The haplotypes generated by FUGUE are shown in tables 5–

significant difference for both CFH and MCP haplotype
frequency in the HUS patients and controls.
The genotype and haplotype results for both cohorts are
internally consistent in that an increase in frequency of the
rarer allele and haplotype for both MCP and CFH was
associated with HUS.
DISCUSSION
In this study we showed a significant difference in two
independent cohorts of atypical HUS patients in both allele
frequency and haplotypes for two complement regulatory
genes, CFH and MCP. Mutations in both these genes have
been described in aHUS patients. However, the inheritance

and penetrance seen with mutations in both these is variable.
For instance in two families with the same MCP mutation
(S206P), only homozygotes are affected in one whereas in the
other heterozygotes are affected.9 Moreover, the series
reported to date show that the penetrance of CFH associated
HUS is approximately 50%. This suggests that other factors
are modifying the inheritance and penetrance. Both CFH and
MCP belong to a cluster of genes located at 1q32 which are
involved in complement regulation, the so called RCA
(regulators of complement activation) cluster. Other mem￾bers of this group include decay accelerating factor (DAF),
complement receptor 1 (CR1), C4 binding protein (C4BP),
and five factor H related proteins (FHR1–5). To date
mutations have only been found in CFH and MCP but it is
possible that genetic variability in these other regulators
could be acting as modifiers for the development of HUS.
Caprioli et al have previously reported that the CFH alleles
2257T, c. 2089G, and c. 2881T are significantly more
common in patients with atypical HUS. The results from
both the Newcastle and Paris cohorts support this observa￾tion.16 They found that this was true both for patients with a
CFH mutation and for those without. In the Newcastle cohort
we found that 2257T c.2089G , and c.2881T were more
frequent in those without known mutations in CFH, MCP,
and IF. In the Paris cohort, the reverse was seen in that
2257T, c. 2089G, and c. 2881T were more frequent in those
with mutations. Caution must therefore be exercised in
interpreting subgroup analysis such as this where numbers
may be inadequate. It is not yet known whether c.2257CRT
or c.2881GRT are functionally significant. c.2089ARG is a
synonymous change. c.2257T is located in a putative NF –kB
binding sequence of the CFH promoter26 and it is known that
CFH expression is upregulated by interferon c, providing a
possible link. c.2881GRT changes a glutamate to an
aspartate in CCP16 of CFH. We have now not only confirmed
Caprioli’s observation but also extended it in two indepen￾dent cohorts to show that genetic variability in MCP is also
associated with atypical HUS. This confirms the recent
finding by Esparza-Godilla et al that a specific SNP haplotype
block which includes MCP was associated with aHUS.17 In the
Paris cohort this strong association was present in both those
with and those without known mutations in CFH, MCP, and
IF. In contrast, the association was only seen in those with
known mutations in the study of Esparza-Godilla. This
discrepancy emphasises the need to be cautious in interpret￾ing such data. In all, six MCP SNPs were examined in the two

cohorts; of these three are intronic, two are in the promoter,
and one is in the 39 UTR. It is possible that the promoter SNPs
or the 39 UTR SNP are functionally significant. In support of
this is the recent study from Esparza-Gordillo which showed
that MCP 2261G disrupts a potentially functional CBF-1/
RBP-Jk binding site. Transient transfection showed that this
was associated with a 25% lower transcriptional activity.17 It
is also possible that a combination of factors within the
haplotype block results in a functional effect. Alternatively,
these markers may simply be surrogates for another untested
SNP in the vicinity.
Conclusion
This study emphasises the importance of variability in CFH
and MCP as a modifier for the development of atypical HUS.
The results suggest that complement regulatory genes in the
RCA cluster are acting in a coordinated manner to prevent
host cell damage and that perturbations of this network in
the face of endothelial injury will lead to a thrombotic
microangiopathy.
