Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl) was recently found to interact with receptor interacting protein 
3 (Rip3) and to be essential for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced programmed necrosis (necroptosis) in cultured 
cell lines. We have generated Mlkl-deficient mice by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)-mediated 
gene disruption and found Mlkl to be dispensable for normal mouse development as well as immune cell develop￾ment. Mlkl-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and macrophages both showed resistance to necrotic but 
not apoptotic stimuli. Mlkl-deficient MEFs and macrophages were indistinguishable from wild-type cells in their abil￾ity to activate NF-κB, ERK, JNK, and p38 in response to TNF and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), respectively. Consis￾tently, Mlkl-deficient macrophages and mice exhibited normal interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and TNF production after 
LPS treatment. Mlkl deficiency protects mice from cerulean-induced acute pancreatitis, a necrosis-related disease, 
but has no effect on polymicrobial septic shock-induced animal death. Our results provide genetic evidence for the 
role of Mlkl in necroptosis.

Introduction
Necrosis is a type of cell death characterized by 
morphologic features, including plasma membrane 
rupture, organelle swelling, mitochondrial dysfunction 
and cytoplasmic leakage [1]. Historically, necrosis had 
been considered as a non-regulated cell death caused by 
overwhelming external stress. However, a growing body 
of evidence has indicated that comparable to apoptosis, 
certain types of necrotic cell death are highly regulated 
by intrinsically defined mechanisms [2-6]. Necroptosis 
was originally used to term receptor interacting protein 
1 (Rip1)-dependent necrosis [4] and has been used as a 
synonym of regulated necrosis by some investigators. 
The necroptosis and apoptosis pathways can influence 
each other [7, 8]. Rip1-dependent necroptosis does not 
play a detectable role in embryonic development or tis￾sue homeostasis in mammals. However, it is a trap door 
that opens when either caspase 8 or FADD is absent [9, 
10]. The inhibition of cIAP and activation of CYLD 
could also promote necroptosis [11, 12]. Necroptosis is 
also prevalent in a broad range of pathological settings, 
such as acute bacterial and viral infections, as well as 
neurodegenerative disorders [13-17].
In the early studies of necroptosis, two serine￾threonine kinases, Rip1 and Rip3, were identified as 
the key regulators of necroptosis [4, 14, 18-24]. While 
Rip1 involvement has been identified in both apoptosis 
and necroptosis, Rip3 appears to participate solely in 
necroptosis. Rip3-producing cells are able to execute 
necroptosis in response to several stimuli under caspase￾compromised conditions, including tumor necrosis fac￾tor α (TNFα), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand 
(TRAIL), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Fas ligand (FasL), and oxi￾dized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) [23, 25-27]. The 
induction of Rip3 observed in a number of pathological 
conditions is likely to be the mechanism underlying in￾creased necroptosis in the pathogenesis of these diseases 
[14, 24, 27-31]. In vitro studies have also shown that

necroptosis can be induced without caspase inhibition 
when Rip3 is overexpressed [23, 32]. Rip1 and Rip3 be￾long to the same kinase family, and both of them contain 
a C-terminal RHIM domain. During necroptosis induc￾tion, Rip1 and Rip3 form a functional amyloid signaling 
complex through RHIM-RHIM domain interaction [33]. 
The assembly of heterodimeric filamentous structures of 
Rip1-Rip3 complex is believed to be indispensable for 
necroptosis [33]. TNF-induced necroptosis is mediated 
by a signaling complex called necrosome (also known as 
complex IIb), which contains TRADD, FADD, caspase 
8, Rip1 and Rip3. Rip1-Rip3 complex is regarded as the 
core of necrosome. In the effort to seek novel molecules 
involved in necroptosis, NAD-dependent deacetylase 
sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), phosphoglycerate mutase family mem￾ber 5 (PGAM5) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like 
protein (Mlkl) have been recently revealed as key signal￾ing factors in necroptosis [18, 32, 34-36]. Identified as 
a target of necrosulfonamide (NSA), a new inhibitor of 
necroptosis in human cells [32], Mlkl, has been demon￾strated to associate with Rip3 and to be phosphorylated 
by Rip3 during the induction of necroptosis. Further￾more, mechanistic analysis has established that the 
phosphorylation of Mlkl by Rip3 is required for Rip3-
dependent necroptosis [32, 36]. 
In order to provide genetic evidence for the essential 
role of Mlkl in necroptosis, we generated Mlkl knockout 
mice using transcription activator-like effector nucleases 
(TALENs)-mediated gene disruption in this study. The 
Mlkl-deficient mice are viable, healthy, fertile and do not 
show any abnormities in development. Mlkl deficiency 
inhibits necroptosis considerably in mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs) and peritoneal macrophages induced 
by a panel of necroptotic stimuli, whereas it has no effect 
on apoptosis. Moreover, knockout of Mlkl ameliorates 
the severity of cerulean-induced acute pancreatitis in 
mice, a necroptosis-related disease [23, 24]. However, 
in the case of diseases with far more complex underly￾ing mechanisms, such as septic shock induced by cecal 
ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice as we showed here, 
inhibition of necroptosis by Mlkl deficiency is apparently 
insufficient to alleviate the high mortality rate. Never￾theless, our data presented here have unambiguously 
established that Mlkl is indeed required for necroptosis 
in vitro and in vivo and may well play a key role in the 
pathogenesis of necroptosis-associated diseases. 
Results
Generation of Mlkl-deficient mice
TALENs-mediated gene mutation is an emerging ap￾proach for targeted gene disruption [37, 38]. Because of 
its similarity to zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)-mediated 
gene disruption, the success of using ZFNs to generate 
gene knockouts in rat and mouse suggests that TALENs 
can be used to generate highly specific gene knockout 
mice [39-41]. We constructed TALEN repeats fused 
with FokI as described [38] and subcloned them into 
pcDNA6.0 vector, which can be used to obtain in vitro￾transcribed mRNA. The TALEN repeats that we used 
were designed to bind the Exon 1 of the Mlkl locus 
(Figure 1A). In vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding this 
TALEN pair was microinjected into the male pronuclei 
of C57BL/6 or Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice 
zygotes. About 30 injected zygotes were then transferred 
into the fallopian tube of each recipient ICR mouse. 
About 18% of the offspring were identified to carry Mlkl
mutations in one or both alleles (Figure 1B). Among the 
71 mice carrying Mlkl mutations, 4 mice contain muta￾tions in both alleles. In total, nine different deletions 
occurred at the TALEN targeting site in these 71 mice 
(Supplementary information, Figure S1). As expected, 
some of the deletions created frameshift mutations and 
others did not. A two-base deletion at the 52nd base 
downstream of ATG site in the Mlkl gene locus was 
found in 23 mice (Figure 1C). Ten of these 23 mice were 
on C57BL/6 background and were selected for further 
breeding and characterization. This two-base deletion 
created a stop codon and thus truncated Mlkl after Gln17 
(Figure 1C). Homozygous Mlkl-deficient (Mlkl−/−) mice 
are viable, healthy, fertile, born with normal Mende￾lian frequency and do not display any gross physical or 
behavioral abnormalities. Western blot using a specific 
anti-Mlkl antibody verified the absence of Mlkl protein 
in MEFs, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), 
peritoneal macrophages and a number of other tissues 
obtained from Mlkl−/−
 mice (Figure 1D and 1E). In wild￾type mice, the expression level of Mlkl protein is high 
in thymus, colon, intestine, liver, spleen and lung, while 
much lower in skeletal muscle, heart and kidney, and 
is undetectable in the brain. The expression pattern of 
Mlkl is quite different from that of Rip3 (Supplementary 
information, Figure S2A). Tissue sections stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) showed no appreciable 
morphological difference in heart muscle, liver, spleen 
and pancreas between wild-type and Mlkl-deficient mice 
(Figure 6A and Supplementary information, Figure S2B), 
suggesting that Mlkl is not required for normal develop￾ment in mice.

Mlkl plays an essential role in necroptosis of macrophag￾es and MEFs
Mlkl has been recently identified as a critical factor 
in regulating necroptosis [18, 32, 36]. Inhibition of Mlkl 
by chemical inhibitors or RNAi blocks TNF-induced 
necroptosis. Here, we investigated whether deletion of 
Mlkl would alleviate necroptosis. It is known that LPS 
or pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl￾Figure 3 Mlkl is required for necroptosis in MEFs and macrophages. (A) Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and Mlkl−/−
mice were treated as indicated for 24 h with DMSO, LPS (100 ng/ml), zVAD (20 µM), oxLDL (150 µg/ml), LPS+zVAD, or 
oxLDL+zVAD. Cell viability was determined by Annexin V-Propidium Iodide double-staining. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, 30 µM) 
was included in some samples as a positive control of necroptosis inhibition. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of tripli￾cates. ***P < 0.001 by Student’s t-test. (B) Wild-type and Mlkl−/− MEFs were treated with DMSO, TNF (30 ng/ml), CHX (10 µg/

as mean ± SEM of triplicates. ***P < 0.001 by Student’s t-test. (C) Wild-type and Mlkl−/− MEFs were treated as indicated for 24 
h with DMSO, TNF (30 ng/ml), Smac mimetic (SmacM) (10 nM), zVAD (20 µM), TNF+SmacM, or TNF+SmacM+zVAD. Cell

alanyl-aspartic-acid (O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone 
(zVAD) alone does not inflict death in macrophages. 
However, the combined treatment with LPS and zVAD 
is able to initiate necroptosis [23]. Similar result was 
observed with treatment of oxLDL and zVAD [27]. 
We isolated peritoneal macrophages from wild-type 
and Mlkl−/−
 mice and tested whether Mlkl is required 
for necroptosis in macrophages. As shown in Figure 
Figure 4 Mlkl deficiency does not affect the formation of necrosome, but delays TNF+SmacM+zVAD-induced mitochondria 
fission. (A) Wild-type and Mlkl−/− MEFs were treated with TNF+SmacM+zVAD for different periods of time, lysed and immuno￾precipitated with anti-Rip3 antibody. The immunoprecipitates and total cell lysates (TCL) were immunoblotted with antibodies 
as indicated. (B) Wild-type and Mlkl−/− MEFs or wild-type and Rip3−/− MEFs were treated with TNF+SmacM+zVAD for different 
periods of time. The cells were stained with Mitotracker Red and cell imaging was recorded.

3A, Mlkl−/−
 macrophages were completely resistant to 
LPS+zVAD- or oxLDL+zVAD-induced necroptosis. 
As a positive control, necrostatin-1 inhibited cell death. 
Other than macrophages, we also examined the effect of 
Mlkl deficiency on cell death in MEFs. Previous studies 
have shown that treatment of MEF cells with TNF plus 
cycloheximide (CHX) and zVAD, or TNF plus Smac mi￾metics (SmacM) and zVAD induced necroptosis [14, 24], 
and TNF plus CHX or SmacM without zVAD triggerred 
apoptotic cell death [42, 43]. Consistent with previous 
findings that Mlkl was not involved in apoptosis [32, 
36], Mlkl deficiency did not affect either TNF+CHX- or 
TNF+SmacM-induced cell death in MEFs (Figure 3B 
and 3C). In agreement with the role of Mlkl in necrop￾tosis, TNF+CHX+zVAD- or TNF+SmacM+zVAD￾induced necroptosis was significantly reduced in Mlkl−/−
MEFs compared to wild-type MEFs (Figure 3B and 
3C), confirming the notion that Mlkl is important for 
necroptosis, but not for apoptosis. Similarly, while apop￾totic cell death induced by TRAIL, another TNF family 
member, plus CHX was not affected by Mlkl deletion, 
TRAIL+CHX+zVAD-induced necroptosis was compro￾mised considerably in the absence of Mlkl (Figure 3D). 
In another case of induced apoptotic cell death, we also 
found that Mlkl deficiency failed to rescue apoptotic cell 
death induced by anticancer drug etoposide or stauro￾sporine (STS) in MEFs (Figure 3D). We noticed that the 
blocking effect of Mlkl deletion on TNF+CHX+zVAD￾induced cell death in MEFs was not as complete as that 
on TNF+SmacM+zVAD-induced necroptosis in MEFs 
or LPS+zVAD-induced necroptosis in macrophages, 
suggesting that TNF+CHX+zVAD induces an additional 
unknown death pathway in MEFs. Collectively, our data 
unambiguously established an involvement of Mlkl in 
necroptosis.
Mlkl mediates signaling downstream of necrosome for￾mation
It has been shown that knockdown of Mlkl does not 
affect TNF-induced interaction between Rip1 and Rip3 
[32]. To confirm that Mlkl is not required for necrosome 
formation, we treated wild-type and Mlkl−/− MEFs with 
TNF, SmacM and zVAD, followed by immunopre￾cipitation using an anti-Rip3 antibody at different time 
points. We were able to detect Rip1 and FADD in the 
immunoprecipitates of Rip3 at the time points after 4 h 
of treatment in both wild-type and Mlkl-deficient MEFs 
(Figure 4A). This indicates that Mlkl is not necessary 
for necrosome formation. As mitochondrial fission was 
proposed to be downstream of the necrosome to promote 
necroptosis [35], we analyzed mitochondrial fragmenta￾tion in wild-type and Mlkl-deficient MEFs at different 
time points after TNF+SmacM+zVAD treatment. After 
necroptotic stimulation, mitochondrial fragmentation ap￾peared at 4 h in wild-type cells, but it was not seen until 
8 h in Mlkl-deficient MEFs (Figure 4B). Similar data 
were obtained using Rip3-deficient cells (Figure 4B). It 
is difficult to conclude from our data whether mitochon￾drial fission promotes necroptosis. Nevertheless, Mlkl or 
Rip3 certainly contributes to the mitochondrial fission 
during the necroptotic process, and Mlkl appears to be 
downstream of necrosome formation in the necroptotic 
pathway. 
Mlkl is not involved in TNF- or LPS-induced activation 
of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
To investigate whether Mlkl participates in the regu￾lation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling downstream of 
TNF receptor 1 or Toll like receptor 4, we treated wild￾type and Mlkl−/− BMDMs with LPS and MEFs with 
TNF, and analyzed the activation status of NF-κB and 
MAPK signaling pathways. The phosphorylation level 
and degradation progression of IκB were measured to 
evaluate the activation of NF-κB; the phosphorylation 
levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), 
c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 were analyzed 
to determine the activation of these three MAP kinase 
pathways. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, disruption of 
Mlkl appeared to have no effect on TNF- or LPS-induced 
activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways in BMDMs 
or MEFs, respectively. In addition to the examination of 
these immediate events induced by LPS or TNF stimula￾tion, we also investigated some of the downstream sce￾narios, such as cytokine mRNA expression and cytokine 
secretion. In vitro cultured BMDMs were stimulated with 
LPS for different periods of time. Levels of TNFα, IL-6, 
IL-1β mRNA expression (Figure 5C) and TNFα and IL-6 
protein secretion (Figure 5D) were measured by real-time 
RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Indeed, we found that 
there was no statistically significant difference between 
wild-type and Mlkl-deficient BMDMs in cytokine pro￾duction, reminiscent of our findings in the early events of 
NF-κB and MAPK activation upon LPS or TNF stimula￾tion. To evaluate whether Mlkl is required for LPS-stim￾ulated cytokine production in vivo, mice were injected 
peritoneally with LPS and the levels of TNFα and IL￾1β in serum at different time points after injection were 
measured. Similar to the in vitro data, Mlkl deficiency 
did not affect LPS-induced TNF and IL-1β expression 
in mice (Figure 5E). Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo
data demonstrated that Mlkl is not required for LPS- and 
TNF-induced cytokine production, which is similar to 
the results that Rip3 is not required for LPS- and TNF￾induced activation of NF-κB and MAPKs and the subse￾quent cytokine expression (Supplementary information, 
Figure S3).

Mlkl deficiency protects mouse from cerulean-induced 
acute pancreatitis
Rip3-dependent necroptosis was reported to play a 
pivotal role in various pathophysiological conditions, 
such as Crohn’s disease, atherosclerosis and acute pan￾creatitis [23, 24, 27, 31, 44]. To determine whether Mlkl 
also plays a role in the progression of necroptosis-asso￾ciated diseases, we analyzed wild-type and Mlkl−/− mice 
in an acute pancreatitis mouse model induced by cerulein 
stimulation. Wild-type mice injected with cerulein every 
hour for 6 consecutive hours showed much more severe 
acinar cell necrosis than Mlkl−/− littermates under the 
same treatment (Figure 6). Thus, our data demonstrated 
that Mlkl is indeed involved in necroptosis in vivo and 
may play a role in the development of necroptosis-asso￾ciated diseases.
Mlkl or Rip3 deficiency does not provide protection 
against polymicrobial septic shock-induced animal death 
in the CLP mouse model
The CLP mouse model is commonly used to study 
polymicrobial sepsis. It was reported recently that Rip3
knockout mice are resistant to CLP-induced death and 
thus Rip3-dependent necroptosis was implied to be im￾portant for septic shock [13]. Here, we sought to investi￾gate whether Mlkl deficiency would affect CLP-induced 
death in mice. Age- and sex-matched littermates of wild￾type and Mlkl−/− mice received a 1.5-cm midline laparo￾tomy to allow the exposure of cecum before the ligation 
of half of the cecum with a silk tie and needle puncture 
with a 22-gauge needle. Mortality was monitored from 
24 h to 144 h after ligation and puncture. Surprisingly, 
analysis of the survival profile revealed no statistically 
significant difference between wild-type and Mlkl−/− mice 
(Figure 7A), which is apparently in conflict with the ob￾servations previously reported in Rip3−/− mice [13]. To 
further evaluate whether there is any difference between 
Mlkl−/− and Rip3−/− mice in response to sepsis, we com￾pared the death rate between wild-type and Rip3−/− mice 
induced by CLP under the same conditions as the experi￾ments described above. As shown in Figure 7B, mortal￾ity rate appeared to be the same between wild-type and 
Rip3−/− mice, which deviated strikingly from the previous 
report that Rip3 knockout mice were resistant to CLP￾induced death [13]. The data shown in Figure 7 demon￾strated that Mlkl−/− mice responded to CLP challenge in 
a similar manner to Rip3−/− mice. Neither Mlkl nor Rip3
deletion had any effect on the survival rate of mice un￾dergoing CLP procedures.
Discussion

necrosome to mediate necroptosis has provided valuable

mouse littermates (n = 7) were given intraperitoneal injections of 50 µg/kg cerulein or saline every hour for 6 consecutive 
hours, 2 h after the last injection, mice were sacrificed and the pancreas of each mouse were subjected to histological analy￾sis. Pancreatic tissue sections were subjected to H&E staining and analyzed for necrotic cell death. Representative micro￾scopic images of H&E-stained pancreatic sections are shown here with quantitative analyses of cell necrosis in the sections.

information for the delineation of the mechanistic basis 
of necroptosis [32, 36]. In this report, we generated Mlkl 
knockout mice using TALENs technique and we further 
presented genetic evidence that Mlkl is indeed involved 
in the induction of necroptosis. In agreement with the 
notion concluded from previous studies conducted in 
cultured cells that Mlkl appears to be specifically in￾volved in Rip3-dependent necroptosis [32, 36], Mlkl
knockout mice showed essentially the same phenotype 
as Rip3 knockout mice in the development of acute 
pancreatitis, a necroptosis-associated disease model in 
mouse [23, 24, 45]. In addition to the in vivo investiga￾tion of the role of Mlkl in necroptosis, we also conducted 
cell culture studies. Compared to wild-type MEFs, TNF/
TRAIL+CHX+zVAD- or TNF+SmacM+zVAD-induced 
necroptosis was reduced in Mlkl−/− MEFs. In contrast, 
Mlkl deficiency did not affect either TNF/TRAIL+CHX￾or TNF+SmacM-induced apoptotic cell death in MEFs. 
Similar to MEFs, Mlkl−/− macrophages were resistant 
to LPS+zVAD- or oxLDL+zVAD-induced necroptosis. 
Taken together, the findings of the present study demon￾strate that Mlkl plays a pivotal role in necroptotic path￾way, both in vitro and in vivo.
In the study of septic shock induced by CLP, we found 
that neither Mlkl nor Rip3 deficiency provided protec￾tion against polymicrobial sepsis-induced animal death. 
In a previous report, Rip3 deletion led to a reduction of 
mortality in mice subjected to CLP [13]. The conflict on 
the role of Rip3 in sepsis is not well understood at this 
stage. It is possible that the intrinsic differences existing 
in these independent experiments are responsible for the 
controversy. For example, it is likely that the resident 
community of cecal bacteria was unique to the experi￾mental animals that were housed in a particular animal 
facility, which might account for the controversial results 
in CLP-induced sepsis. In the future, it would certainly 
be interesting to investigate whether distinct resident 
cecal bacterial groups would elicit differential host re￾sponses in septic shock. Indeed, although the enormous 
complexity of the systematic inflammatory response in 
sepsis has been realized for decades, the heterogenic 
nature of the underlying mechanisms culminating in 
multiple organ failure at the late stage of sepsis remains 
largely underappreciated. It is well established that in ad￾dition to immunosuppression, cell death also plays a role 
in the progression of sepsis [46]. As several cell death 
modes, including apoptosis, necroptosis, NETosis and 
pyroptosis, occur simultaneously during the progression 
of sepsis, there is no conclusive evidence to determine 
which cell death mode plays a more deleterious role. 
Thus, it is very likely that in our case, although necrop￾tosis was largely blocked by Mlkl or Rip3 knockout, ex￾tensive tissue damage caused by other types of cell death 
was essentially unaffected and is sufficient to give rise to 
a high mortality rate in sepsis.
Mlkl has been demonstrated as a substrate of Rip3, but 
controversial data have been reported on whether Mlkl 
itself has kinase activity [32, 36]. The sequence of Mlkl 
is most closely related to the family of mixed lineage 
kinases, a group of protein kinases that can function as 
MKKKs, the upstream kinases that regulate the JNK and 
p38 MAPK pathways [47]. We showed in Figure 5A and 
5B that LPS- and TNF-induced activation of JNK and 
p38 was not affected by Mlkl deletion, which excluded a 
role of Mlkl in MAPK activation. Regardless of whether 
Mlkl acts as a kinase or scaffold protein in the necrop￾totic pathway, the identification of the signaling effectors 
Figure 7 Neither Mlkl nor Rip3 deficiency protects mice against 
CLP-mediated polymicrobial septic shock. (A) The age- and 
sex-matched littermates of wild-type (n = 10) or Mlkl−/− mice (n
= 10) underwent a small midline laparotomy to expose the ce￾cum. The exposed cecum was then ligated and punctured with 
a needle as described in Materials and Methods. Sham surgery 
was performed without the procedures of cecal ligation and 
puncture. There was no significant difference between these 
two groups. (B) The age- and sex-matched Rip3−/− (n = 18) and 
wild-type mouse littermates (n = 18) underwent the same proto￾col as described in (A). Similarly, no significant difference was 
observed.

downstream of Mlkl would be of great interest in the 
future for a better understanding of necroptotic signaling 
cascades.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility. All 
experiments were conducted in compliance with the regulations of 
Xiamen University. Rip3−/− mice were produced by targeted gene 
deletion [45].
Generation of Mlkl knockout mice by TALEN
TALEN constructs were linearized at the PVU2 site. In vitro
transcripts were generated using T7 Message Max kit (Epicentre, 
IL, USA) and polyA tailing kit (Epicentre), following the manu￾facturer’s instructions. Washed and dried RNA was dissolved in 
water, and the concentration was determined using a spectropho￾tometer. TALEN mRNA was injected into mouse fertilized eggs 
at 4 ng/µl. Injected eggs were then transferred to pseudopregnant 
females at 0.5 days post coitum (dpc). New-born mice tail DNA 
samples were amplified with PrimeStar (Takara, Dalian, China) 
and the PCR products were sequenced for the screening of hetero￾zygous or knockout descendants.
Antibodies
Anti-Mlkl antibody used in this present study was generated in 
our lab and immunoaffinity-purified. Anti-JNK (51151-1-AP) anti￾body was purchased from Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL, USA). 
Anti-p-IκB (9246), anti-IκB (9242), anti-p-ERK (9101), anti-ERK 
(9107), anti-p-JNK (9251), anti-p-p38 (4511) and anti-p38 (9228) 
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Dan￾vers, MA, USA). Anti-GAPDH (sc-32233) antibody was obtained 
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA), and anti-β-actin anti￾body was provided by Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). 
Isolation of mouse BMDMs
Mouse BMDMs were differentiated in vitro from isolated bone 
marrow cells. Bone marrow cells collected from mouse femurs 
and tibias were incubated for 7 days in DMEM containing 20% 
heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and 30% L929 
conditional medium.
Isolation of mouse peritoneal macrophages
Eight-week-old mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml 
thioglycollate, and peritoneal macrophages were isolated 3 or 4 
days later, as described previously. Red blood cells were removed 
by the ACK lysis buffer. Macrophages were resuspended in Dul￾becco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf 
serum, and seeded in 12-well plate. 
Isolation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts
Fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos at 2 weeks post co￾itum were trypsinized and were cultured for two to four passages 
in 10-cm plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum.
In vitro mouse peritoneal macrophage cell death assay
Macrophages were treated with different stimuli as indicated, 
and cell death was measured by Annexin V-Propidium Iodide dou￾ble stain kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Macrophages were incubated 
with Annexin V in binding buffer for 20 min on ice in dark. After 
Annexin V staining solution was removed, the cells were then 
stained with propidium iodide for 3 min. Stained cells were imme￾diately analyzed under a fluorescence microscope and four random 
views were captured for each sample. The Annexin V-Propidium 
Iodide double-positive cells were defined as necrosis. Annexin V 
single-positive cells were considered apoptotic.
Flow cytometry
Fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against mouse CD3, CD4, 
CD8, CD11b, B220, IGM and Gr-1 were used for flow cytometry 
analysis in this study. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from 
thymus, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen, respectively, and 
stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies before the analysis 
using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer.
Staining of mitochondria
Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and treated as indicated, 
then stained with Mitotracker Red for 30 min, washed with PBS 
and fixed with 4% PFA. The slides were observed with the Zeiss 
LSM 780 confocal microscope.
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were treated as indicated, then washed with PBS, lysed in 
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 
mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM Sodium pyrophosphate, 1 
mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 µg/ml Leupeptin) and 
immunoprecipitated with protein A/G-sepharose beads crosslinked 
with anti-Rip3 antibody. Immunocomplexes were subjected to 
SDS-PAGE.
RNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated from mouse macrophages or mouse 
bone marrow cells by RNA-iso reagent (Takara). Ten micrograms 
of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using oligo (dT) primer 
(5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and M-MLV reverse tran￾scriptase (BGI, Shenzheng, China) to generate cDNA. The ex￾pression levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and GAPDH mRNA were 
measured by Real time RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR assays were 
performed using SYBR Green I on CFX96 Real-time RT-PCR 
detection system (Bio-Rad). Primers sequences used in this study 
are listed as follows: mouse IL-1β (forward: 5′-AAGGGCTGCT￾TCCAAACCTTTGAC-3′, reverse: 5′-ATACTGCCTGCCT￾GAAGCTCTTGT-3′), mouse TNF-α (forward: 5′-CCAGTGTGG￾GAAGCTGTCTT-3′, reverse: 5′-AAGCAAAAGAGGAGGCAA￾CA-3′), mouse IL-6 (forward: 5′-CTGGGAAATCGTGGAAAT￾GAG-3′, reverse: 5′-TCCAGTTTGGTAGCATCCATCA-3′), 
mouse GAPDH (forward: 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′, 
reverse: 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′). PCR was car￾ried out for 35 cycles using the following conditions: denaturation 
at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 58 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 
°C for 20 s.
Western blotting
The cells were cultured in 12-well plates and treated with in￾dicated stimuli. Cells were harvested at different time points and 
lysed with 1.2× SDS sample buffer, immediately. Total cell lysates

were separated using SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF mem￾brane (Millipore), and western blotting was performed with the 
appropriate antibodies. The proteins were visualized by enhanced 
chemiluminescence in accordance with the manufacturer’s in￾structions (ECL, Millipore).
Cytokine secretion analysis
BMDMs were seeded in 12-well plates, treated with indicated 
stimuli. Supernatants were collected and measured by commercial 
ELISA kits for mouse IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β (R&D, USA), fol￾lowing the manufacturer’s instructions. For in vivo LPS stress, 
mice were injected with LPS (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, and 
sera were collected before (0 h) and after (2 h, 4 h and 8 h) LPS 
injection and analyzed for their IL-1β and TNF-α levels by ELI￾SA.
Cerulei-induced acute pancreatitis
Male Mlkl−/− and wide-type mouse littermates at 6-8 weeks of 
age (n = 7) were treated every hour for 6 consecutive hours with 
cerulein (50 µg/kg, Sigma) intraperitoneal injection. Animals 
were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection. Pancreas tissues were 
removed, fixed, dehydrated, embedded and sectioned. Analysis 
of pancreatitis-associated pancreas necrotic injury was conducted 
by H&E staining. Necrosis in eight random microscopic fields 
per animal was quantitatively analyzed. The acinar cell necrosis 
criteria were described previously [23]. All images were captured 
and processed using identical settings in the Zeiss LSM 780 Laser 
Scanning Confocal Microscope at Xiamen University.
Polymicrobial sepsis induced by CLP in mice
Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with 1% pelltobarbitalum 
natricum by intraperitoneal injection. The operative procedures 
were performed under sterile conditions. After disinfection of 
the abdomen, animals subjected for CLP procedures underwent a 
small midline (1.5 cm) laparotomy to expose cecum. Fifty percent 
of the cecum was ligated with a 4-0 silk tie and punctured once 
with a 22-gauge needle. The abdomen was sutured in two layers 
with 4-0 suture for the peritoneum and abdominal musculature 
and wound clips for the skin. As described in the results, CLP 
was performed to induce polymicrobial sepsis in mice. The sham 
group underwent the same procedure, but without cecal liga￾tion and puncture. Mice were randomized with regard to age and 
genotype.
H&E staining
During mouse autopsy, dissected mouse tissues were harvested 
freshly and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h. The fixed 
tissues were then embedded into paraffin, and sectioned at 5-µm 
thickness with a Microtome (Leica RM2016, Germany). Deparaf￾finized, rehydrated sections were stained with hematoxylin for 
5 min, and then differentiated in 0.1% acid alcohol followed by 
bluing and counterstaining in 0.5% eosin Y solution and the final 
dehydration. H&E stained sections were examined by a skilled 
pathologist.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± SEM. Means between groups 
were calculated by Student’s t-test. P-values < 0.05 were consid￾ered statistically significant.
