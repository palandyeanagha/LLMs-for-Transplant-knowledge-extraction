Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes remain significant public health concerns. Targeting of prevention
efforts by geographical location has been suggested by the Institute of Medicine to coincide with the presence of
area-based risk. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a stronger risk factor than is obesity for the prediction of future CVD
and diabetes, yet its prevalence has not previously been described geographically. Our objective is to determine
geographical variation in the prevalence of obesity, MetS, and diabetes among US adults. We assessed the prevalence
of obesity, MetS, and diabetes by US census division, and the prevalence of obesity, MetS, and diabetes for each sex
and racial/ethnic group by US region among 9826 US non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic adults
aged 20–65 years participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014. We also compared
a sex- and race/ethnicity-specific MetS severity score by geographical area. The prevalence of obesity, MetS, and
diabetes varied by US census division and region, with overall similarity by geographical area in the prevalence of each
of these conditions. The prevalence of MetS was particularly high (≥35%) in the West North Central, West South
Central, and East South Central and low (30%) in the Pacific, New England, and Mid-Atlantic divisions. Some of the
geographical variation appeared due to differences among non-Hispanic white females, who had a high prevalence of
MetS (>32%) in the Midwest and South and a low prevalence of MetS (24%) in the West and Northeast. Geographical
differences in MetS imply variation in the risk for future CVD and diabetes, with more elevated risk in the center of the
United States. As MetS is a stronger risk factor for prediction of CVD and T2DM than is obesity, these differences are
potentially important for prompting public health efforts toward surveillance and prevention in high-risk areas.
Introduction
The epidemic of obesity in the United States and world￾wide has raised public health alarm because of associations
with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular dis￾ease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes. This has led to assessments
of the geographical distribution of obesity in the United
States1,2
, in part to alert health departments and clinicians
in highly affected areas regarding needs for surveillance and
preventive services3
. Nevertheless, not all individuals with
obesity have high risk for these chronic diseases4
. And while
some geographical assessments report the geographical
distribution of CVD and diabetes themselves; prevalence of
these is strongly influenced by access to medical care, which
varies widely by region2
.
One well-described condition potentially in the causative
pathway between obesity and CVD and diabetes is the
metabolic syndrome (MetS)5–7
, a cluster of CVD risk fac￾tors including central obesity, high blood pressure (BP),
high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol, and high fasting
blood glucose8
. These abnormalities appear to be produced
by underlying processes of systemic inflammation, oxidative
stress, and cellular dysfunction9
. Prior studies demonstrated
that individuals with MetS have 2–20-year odds ratios of

1.58 for future CVD10 and 5.16 for diabetes11. In addition to
use of the traditional dichotomous criteria, where MetS is
classified if an individual has at least three risk factors
(which has been linked to racial/ethnic discrepancies12–16),
MetS can be assessed using a continuous severity score,
which is also linked to risk for future CVD5,17 and dia￾betes18,19. Although many international organizations have
recognized the potential importance of MetS in risk pre￾diction7
, geographical variation in MetS has not previously
been reported, presumably because it requires a specific set
of laboratory and clinical measures to determine. Given the
potential to reduce MetS-related risk through primary
prevention approaches20, knowledge of geographical varia￾tion in MetS may be useful to guide prevention measures.
Our goal was to evaluate MetS prevalence by area in the
United States on an age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific
basis and compare these to the geographical prevalence of
(1) obesity and diabetes, (2) MetS severity scores, and (3)
the individual MetS components. These data may have
implications for emphasis of preventive measures against
CVD and diabetes by geographical area.
Materials/subjects and methods
Data were obtained from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2014, a
complex, multistage probability sample of the US popu￾lation. These annual cross-sectional surveys are con￾ducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control; the NCHS
ethics review board approved the survey and participants
provided informed consent. Participants answered ques￾tionnaires and underwent measures of WC, blood pres￾sure (BP), and laboratory measures of fasting triglycerides,
HDL-C, and fasting glucose were obtained using stan￾dardized protocols and calibrated equipment (http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). Analyses were per￾formed at an NCHS Research Data Center due to use of
geographic variables. Survey procedures in SAS were used
to estimate rates across the nine US census divisions (New
England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, West North
Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South
Central, Mountain, and Pacific); due to sample size
restrictions, rates by sex and race/ethnicity were reported
across the four census regions (Northeast, Midwest,
South, and West). The groupings of the US census divi￾sions into regions are shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
Adults 20–65 years of age were included in the
analysis; participants were excluded if reporting they were
pregnant or if they were missing any variables related
to MetS, diabetes status, BMI, or geographic location
(Supplementary Figure 2).
Obesity was defined as BMI ≥30. MetS was defined
using the ATP-III criteria8
. Participants had to meet ≥3 of
the following five criteria: elevated waist circumference
(≥102 cm for men, ≥88 cm for women), elevated fasting
triglycerides (≥150 mg/dl), reduced HDL (<40 mg/dl for
men, <50 mg/dl for women), elevated BP (≥130 mmHg
systolic or ≥85 mmHg diastolic or use of antihypertensive
medication), and elevated fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dl).
These criteria did not take diabetes medications or dia￾betes status (beyond elevated fasting glucose) into
account. Diabetes was defined by participant report or
fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl.
MetS severity z-scores were calculated using sex- and
race-based formulas. As described elsewhere21–23, these
scores were derived using a confirmatory factor analysis
approach for the five traditional MetS components (WC,
triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, systolic BP, and fasting
glucose) to determine the weighted contribution of each
components to a latent MetS “factor” on a sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific basis. Confirmatory factor analysis was
performed among adults aged 20–64 years from
NHANES 1999–2010 with categorization into six sub￾groups based on sex and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic). For each of
these six population subgroups, loading coefficients for
the five MetS components were transformed into a single
MetS factor and used to generate equations to calculate a
standardized MetS severity score for each subgroup
(http://mets.health-outcomes-policy.ufl.edu/calculator/).
The resulting MetS severity scores are z-scores (normally
distributed and ranging from theoretical negative to
positive infinity with mean = 0 and SD = 1) of relative
MetS severity on a sex- and race/ethnicity-specific basis.
These scores correlate strongly with other markers of
MetS risk, including hsCRP, uric acid, and the home￾ostasis model of insulin resistance22, with adiponectin24
and with long-term risk of CVD5, 17 and T2DM18, 19.
These scores are particularly unique in being specific to
sex and to the three major racial/ethnic groups and in
being associated with CVD and T2DM independent of the
individual MetS risk factors, potentially demonstrating
links to risks associated with the processes underlying
MetS5, 19.
Statistical analysis
Survey procedures using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) were used
to account for the complex survey design of NHANES.
These procedures were used to estimate rates of obesity,
ATP-III MetS, and diabetes, along with mean MetS
z-scores and BMI, by various demographic subgroups as
well as by US census division and region.
Results
Participant characteristics by US census division
Table 1 displays participant demographics for adults aged
20–65 years by US census division and region. Notably, in
the New England and the West North Central divisions, the

mean age tended to be slightly older (44.2 and 44.8 years,
respectively—with all others 40.6–41.9 years) and with a
greater proportion of non-Hispanic white individuals (92.9
and 93.4%—all others 59.4–84.2%), while the South Atlantic
and East South Central had the highest proportion of non￾Hispanic black participants (22.8 and 21.4%—all others
1.5–13.4%) and the West South Central and Pacific had the
highest proportion of Hispanic participants (28.3 and 28.1%
—others 1.7–21.6%).
Prevalence of obesity, MetS, and diabetes by US census
division
Figure 1 displays prevalence of obesity, MetS, and
diabetes for adults overall and by division, and Table 2
provides these data divided into adults aged 20–39 and
40–65 years. Overall, obesity prevalence was lowest in
the Mountain and New England divisions (26.7 and
28.7%, respectively) and highest in the West South
Central and East South Central (37.5 and 37.2%)
(Fig. 1a). Among younger adults, obesity prevalence was
low in New England (17.7%), high in the West South
Central and East South Central (35.8 and 36.2%), and
similar in all other divisions (all 26–29%) (Table 2). Among
older adults, obesity was lowest in the Mountain division
(27.1%), highest in the divisions that comprise the Midwest
and South regions (all ≥38%), and similar in the other
divisions (all 35–37%). The difference in prevalence of
obesity between younger and older adults was sharp in the
divisions in the Northeast and Midwest regions, where
older age ranges had >10% higher prevalence than the lower
age range.
MetS prevalence overall was lowest in the Pacific and
New England (29.0 and 29.2%) and highest in the West
North Central (40.0%) (Fig. 1b). Among younger adults,
MetS was lowest in New England (12.8%) and highest in
the West North Central and the divisions in the South
region (all 23–27%) and similar in other divisions (all
18–20%) (Table 2). Among older adults, MetS prevalence
was highest in South Atlantic and the divisions in the
Midwest and South regions (all 42–47%) and similar in
other divisions (all 38–40%).
Diabetes prevalence was lowest in New England (4.5%)
and highest in the East South Central and West North
Central (9.4 and 9.0%). Among young adults, diabetes
prevalence was highest in the Mid-Atlantic and West
South Central (4.4 and 3.1%), but overall low in other
divisions (all ≤2.6%) (Table 2). Among older adults, dia￾betes was lowest in New England (6.4%) and high in East
South Central and East North Central (15.9 and 14.0%)
and similar in other divisions (all 10–13%).
Sex and racial/ethnic variation by region
We next set out to investigate possible explanations for
the geographical variation in MetS, including variation by
sex, race/ethnicity, and individual MetS component.
Supplementary Table 1 provides sex- and racial/ethnic￾specific breakdown by US region. There were notable
differences among non-Hispanic white individuals across
regions. In the Northeast and West, non-Hispanic white
females had favorable prevalences of obesity (25.8 and
30.3%, respectively), MetS (23.3 and 24.9%), and diabetes
(4.1 and 4.4%), while in the West, non-Hispanic white
males also had low prevalence of obesity (25.7%), MetS
(32%), and diabetes (6%). By contrast, in the Midwest non￾Hispanic whites (overall, 87% of the Midwest population)
had a high prevalence of obesity (males, 34.2%; females,
35.2%), MetS (males, 34.2%; females, 35.2%), and diabetes
(males, 10.3%; females, 7%). In the South, there was a high
prevalence of MetS among non-Hispanic white males
(36.2%) and among Hispanic females (34.4%). Non￾Hispanic black males had high prevalence of MetS in
the West (32.6%) and otherwise an overall low prevalence
of MetS elsewhere (15.2–23.4%), but had a high pre￾valence of diabetes (8.7–12.7%). In three of the four
regions, non-Hispanic black women had the highest
prevalence of MetS among females of these three racial/
ethnic groups (30.9–36.7%).
We next looked at regional differences in sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific MetS severity z-scores, given known
racial/ethnic discrepancies of ATP-III MetS in its rela￾tionship with insulin resistance and risk12–16. These MetS
severity z-scores corresponded well in general with dia￾betes prevalence by region, with higher mean scores by
sex and race/ethnicity in regions with high prevalence of
diabetes (e.g., Hispanic males, with MetS scores 0.33–0.40
—the highest of all groups—and diabetes prevalence of
9.19.1–11.1) and low mean scores in regions with low
diabetes prevalence (e.g., among non-Hispanic white
females). The exception was among non-Hispanic black
males, who had overall low MetS severity z-scores (−0.20
to 0.08) in three of four regions with correspondingly high
diabetes prevalence (9.3–10.3%).
Finally, Supplementary Table 2 provides prevalence of
abnormalities in the individual MetS components by
region. In assessing for specific MetS component
abnormalities, we noted that the high MetS prevalence in
the Midwest was associated with high prevalence of
abnormalities in each individual component, with the
Midwest having the highest prevalence of all regions for
four out of five components (and second highest for BP
elevations). These abnormalities in the Midwest were
generally reflected among both males and females and
among each racial/ethnic group. The South was in turn
highest for BP elevations (particularly, among non￾Hispanic blacks) and second highest for WC and low
HDL (especially among Hispanics), while the West and
Northeast were lowest for individual component
abnormalities.

Discussion
We found geographic variation in the prevalence of
MetS, an important predictor of CVD, identifying areas
where a large proportion of US adults are at risk. Overall,
we found higher proportions of MetS-, obesity-, and
diabetes-related risk in the center of the country, where
33–40% of individuals in the Midwest and South had
MetS. This was in contrast to the New England, Mid￾Atlantic, and Pacific divisions, where less than 30% of
individuals had MetS. As opposed to prior reports which
have suggested, for example, a stroke “belt” in the United
States from the South up through the Ohio River Valley,
these data and others begin to portray an obesity and
MetS “zipper” extending from the South up through the
Midwest. The reasons for these variations are unclear,
though these differences appeared to parallel regional
differences in the prevalence of abnormalities in the
individual MetS components—with all five MetS com￾ponent abnormalities being most common in the Midwest
and South. Given that MetS is a stronger predictor of
CHD than is obesity10, 25, these data may have implica￾tions for targeting surveillance and prevention to these
more heavily affected areas, as suggested by the Institute
of Medicine3
. While more granular data are also impor￾tant—providing glimpses into characteristics of neigh￾borhoods at highest risk26—the current data nevertheless
provide guidance for national public health policy makers
regarding geographical areas of the country at very high
metabolic risk and in need of additional attention.
While we are unaware of other such attempts to provide
estimates of MetS-related risk by geographical area, our
estimates of the prevalence of obesity by region are overall
similar to those seen from other recent surveys. The
behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS) relies
on a telephone survey to collect height and weight mea￾surements by self-report (with potential inaccuracy),
reporting that in 2010 there were high concentrations of
obesity prevalence in states in the South, where 8/8 states
in the West South Central and East South Central had an
obesity prevalence ≥30%; however, the BRFSS had overall
lower estimates in the Midwest than we found, with only
2/12 states in the West North Central and East North
Central having an obesity prevalence ≥30%1
. A study
based on measured height and weight estimates from the
reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke
(REGARDS) data reported the highest obesity prevalence
in the West North Central (41.3%), with prevalences in
the range of 34–37% in the South and East North Cen￾tral1
, while a combination of BRFSS and REGARDS data
reported the highest prevalence in the West North Cen￾tral and West South Central27—very similar to what we
found. Similarly, Slack et al. looked at multiple govern￾mental sources for data on obesity prevalence at the
county level and reported the highest concentrations in
the South, with smaller pockets in states in the West
North Central and East North Central28. Overall, these
data support our findings of higher obesity prevalence in
the South and Midwest.
With respect to estimates of CVD risk, Yang et al.
evaluated a 10-year risk of CVD based on self-reported
BRFSS data, finding that among males 3/4 states in the
West South Central and 4/4 in the East South Central had
a 10-year risk ≥15.1%, while risk was lower in the East
North Central (4/5 states with 10-year risk ≥14.6%) and
the West North Central (1/7 states with 10-year risk
≥14.6%)29. In another study, Yang et al. estimated CVD
risk factors to determine “excess heart age,” finding the
most concerning estimates in the South30. Death rates of
coronary heart disease (CHD) by state published by the
American Heart Association (AHA) identify similar geo￾graphic themes as we observed, with states of higher risk
being located in the South and Midwest2
. However, we

noted the highest MetS prevalence in the West North
Central division, where no state was in the highest cate￾gory for CHD mortality2
. This difference may be impor￾tant in considering MetS as a marker of future CHD risk,
identifying on-going needs for intervention in these states.
Alternatively, this discrepancy between MetS and CHD
mortality in this region may relate to higher healthcare
access and earlier treatment2
.
In considering intervention toward prevention of CVD,
we noted potentially important differences by adult age
group. Among young adults aged 20–39, there was a
particularly high prevalence of obesity in the South
(>35%) and of MetS in the South and West North Central
(all >24%). While the West had overall more favorable
prevalences of obesity and MetS compared to other
regions, these prevalences among younger adults were not
dramatically different from the Midwest, suggesting the
potential for future increases in the prevalence of MetS
and related disease risk as this younger group ages. In
considering MetS as a risk indicator to prompt interven￾tion, this higher prevalence of MetS among young adults
in these regions may reflect the widespread nature of
obesigenic lifestyle risks in this age group and the need to
maintain lifestyle intervention efforts among young adults
in all regions to prevent future CVD and diabetes.
The geographical variation in MetS did not on the
surface appear to be due to differences in racial/ethnic
demographics alone16, 31. While obesity is more prevalent
among some racial/ethnic minorities16, 32, we found high
prevalence of MetS in areas such as the West North
Central division, which is >93.4% white, and low pre￾valence in the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific divisions, where
26.8% and 34% of individuals, respectively, are racial/
ethnic minorities. Though we were limited by NCHS RDC
restrictions that prevented reporting of racial/ethnic
prevalence data in the nine US census divisions, we did
note racial/ethnic differences between the four US census
regions, with MetS particularly among non-Hispanic
white women, who had a low prevalence of MetS in the
West and Northeast (both <25%), but a high prevalence in
the Midwest and South (both >32%). While the regional
data were not in themselves designed to be nationally
representative, these racial/ethnic differences could
potentially prompt surveillance and diabetes prevention
for specific at-risk groups.
There appeared to be a reasonable correspondence
between diabetes prevalence and both ATP-III MetS
prevalence and mean levels of a sex- and race/ethnicity￾specific MetS severity z-score by subgroup and region.
This MetS severity score was formulated in part because
of noted discrepancies between ATP-III MetS and other
risk factors for CVD and diabetes12–16. However, we
noted that despite the high prevalence of diabetes among
non-Hispanic black males by region, there were both
lower-than-expected prevalence of ATP-III MetS and
mean levels of MetS severity z-scores. These findings
potentially reflect that non-Hispanic black males either
continue to elude assessment of MetS-related risk or that
they experience a high rate of non-MetS-related causes of
diabetes, such as genetic relationships to beta-cell func￾tion33, 34. Our prior assessments of longitudinal risk
related to MetS among non-Hispanic black males
demonstrated similar long-term prediction of CVD as
seen in whites5 and a stronger relationship between
baseline MetS severity and prospective risk for diabetes19.
Therefore, these relationships require further
investigation.
Lower rates of obesity-related risk by geographical area
in other surveys have been attributed to healthier lifestyle
practices2
. In assessing ideal cardiovascular health (a
combination of physical activity, dietary, smoking, and
health factors), the AHA reported that each of the states
in New England and 9/13 West regional states were in the
top two quintiles of ideal cardiovascular health practices
compared to 0/20 states in the South or Midwest regions2
.
Therefore, policy changes in more highly affected regions,
in addition to improving healthcare access, should con￾sider targeting improved lifestyle practices across these
populations to reduce future disease risk3, 35.
This study had multiple limitations, including the cross￾sectional nature, which rendered us unable to conclude
regarding causation between obesity, MetS, and diabetes.
We were also limited by the relatively small numbers of
participants in each US division, resulting in wide con￾fidence intervals for many of the estimates reported and
insufficient power to assess for changes in prevalence by
division over time. Prior to 2007, sampling of Hispanic
individuals who were not Mexican-Americans did not
reflect the true proportion in the US population, meaning
that prevalence estimates among Hispanic individuals
may be excessively influenced by Mexican-American
individuals. In addition, NHANES survey weights were
designed to be nationally representative, not specifically
representative of each US census region. Our intent in this
analysis was to provide an ecologic study of the prevalence
of obesity and MetS; further, analyses will be needed to
determine how underlying contributors including diet,
physical activity, smoking, socioeconomic factors, under￾lying inflammation, and healthcare access contribute to
these differences by geographical area. This study had
multiple strengths, being the first of its kind to assess
geographic variation in MetS by US division and region and
to explore related factors, including the individual MetS
components and variation by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
In conclusion, we noted geographic variation in MetS
prevalence, with continued high need for preventive
efforts in the center of the country among adults overall,
and a fairly ubiquitous need for these efforts among young

adults. Given the high rate of progression to CVD and
diabetes among individuals with MetS, these data serve as
a reminder for vigilance toward surveillance and lifestyle
modification.
