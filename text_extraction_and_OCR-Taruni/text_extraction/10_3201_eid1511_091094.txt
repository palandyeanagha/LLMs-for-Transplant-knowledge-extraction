In 2008, acute hepatitis E infection was confi rmed in 4 
passengers returning to the United Kingdom after a world 
cruise. Epidemiologic investigation showed that of 789 per￾sons who provided blood samples, 195 (25%) were sero￾positive, 33 (4%) had immunoglobulin [Ig] M levels consis￾tent with recent acute infection (11 of these persons were 
symptomatic), and 162 (21%) had IgG only, consistent with 
past infection. Passenger mean age was 68 years. Most 
(426/789, 54%) passengers were female, yet most with 
acute infection (25/33, 76%) were male. Sequencing of RNA 
from 3 case-patients identifi ed hepatitis E virus genotype 
3, closely homologous to genotype 3 viruses from Europe. 
Signifi cant association with acute infection was found for be￾ing male, drinking alcohol, and consuming shellfi sh while on 
board (odds ratio 4.27, 95% confi dence interval 1.23–26.94, 
p = 0.019). This was probably a common-source foodborne 
outbreak.
I
n 1980, hepatitis E virus (HEV) was recognized as a 
cause of human disease (1,2). HEV infections can be 
asymptomatic or they can induce clinical hepatitis, which 
may be severe or life threatening, particularly for pregnant 
women. Other clinical manifestations associated with HEV 
infection have been reported. HEV is usually transmitted 
by the fecal–oral route and has an incubation period of 15–
60 days (3). Four HEV genotypes that infect humans have 
been identifi ed: genotype 1 is regularly found in HEV-en￾demic areas such as Africa and Asia; genotype 2 in Mexico 
and West Africa; genotype 3 in the United States, Europe, 
and Japan; and genotype 4 in Asia (3,4). Although HEV is 
increasingly recognized as a cause of hepatitis in industrial￾ized countries (5,6), it is thought to be a relatively uncom￾mon cause of viral hepatitis in the United Kingdom.
On March 27, 2008, the Southampton Port Health Au￾thority informed the Health Protection Agency (HPA) of 4 
elderly ship passengers with jaundice, who were returning 
from a world cruise. Because they had been fully vaccinated 
against hepatitis A, HEV was considered and subsequently 
identifi ed as the probable causative agent. The ship had de￾parted from Southampton, UK, on January 7 and returned 
on March 28, 2008. The ship had sequentially visited ports 
in Madeira, the Americas (South, Central, and North), the 
Caribbean region, Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, Australia, 
Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Egypt, 
Greece, and Spain before returning to the United Kingdom. 
Although the ship had only 1,800 passenger berths (cruise 
ship company data), the cumulative total of passengers dur￾ing the cruise approached 3,000 because persons joined and 
left at different ports.
Because the outbreak of HEV was unusual, especial￾ly because it occurred on a cruise ship, and had potential 
public health implications, an epidemiologic investigation 
was undertaken. The investigation aimed to identify addi￾tional cases, help prevent future incidents by identifying 
possible risk factors for infection, describe the outbreak 
epidemiology, and further scientifi c understanding of the 
epidemiology and natural history of hepatitis E infection. 
The investigation was approved and commissioned by the 
HPA’s Hepatitis Programme Board. All participants had 
been passengers on board the cruise ship and volunteered 
and gave written informed consent. Ethics approval was 
not required.
Methods
The investigation focused on all UK passengers who 
had been on the cruise at any point from January through 
March 2008. Contact addresses were provided by the cruise 
ship company, and 2,850 passengers were sent letters invit￾ing them to participate in the investigation and explaining 
why. On the basis of when they were most likely to have 
been exposed (ascertained from the fi rst 4 cases), partici￾Hepatitis E Outbreak on Cruise Ship

Hepatitis E on Cruise Ship
pants were asked to go to their own doctors to give blood 
samples within 2 weeks (the time frame for detection of 
immunoglobulin [Ig] M). HPA provided sample kits with 
prepaid return packaging. Blood samples were tested for 
HEV antibodies (IgG and IgM) by using the Fortress Di￾agnostics ELISAs (Fortress Diagnostics Limited, Antrim, 
Northern Ireland) at the Virus Reference Department at the 
HPA Centre for Infections. Assays were run in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s instructions. The Fortress assays 
were chosen for this investigation because our validation 
exercises (data not shown) had demonstrated these assays 
to be more sensitive and specifi c than some other commer￾cially available assays. Samples were screened for IgG, and 
those that were positive were then tested for IgM. The IgM￾seropositive samples were further analyzed for HEV RNA, 
and those that were RNA positive were genotyped as pre￾viously described (7). Briefl y, phylogenetic analysis of a 
300-bp region of open reading frame 2 was conducted. The 
generated sequences were compared with genotype 3 se￾quences from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United 
States and with genotype 1, 2, and 4 sequences retrieved 
from GenBank.
Participants returned self-completed questionnaires 
by mail. Detailed information was collected about demo￾graphic characteristics, potential risk factors and cofactors 
for disease (medical conditions, food and drink consump￾tion, excursions, water exposure such as water activities in 
pools on the cruise ship and swimming in the sea while off 
the ship) and any relevant signs and symptoms. All HPA 
documents and fi les containing patient identifi able infor￾mation were handled and stored in compliance with Caldi￾cott guidance (8).
Participants were classifi ed according to their sero￾logic results as having had recent acute infection (sero￾logically confi rmed by HEV IgM and IgG), past infection 
(serologically confi rmed by HEV IgG only and therefore 
unlikely to have been acquired during the cruise), or no in￾fection (serologically negative for HEV IgG). Those with 
recent acute infection also provided further blood samples 
for liver function testing and confi rmatory HEV antibody 
testing. Patients with acute cases were followed up by the 
local Health Protection Unit of the HPA. Liver function 
tests were performed by local services, and results were re￾ported back to the HPA on a specifi c form. Blood samples 
for HEV testing were returned by mail as described above. 
A symptomatic hepatitis case was defi ned as recent acute 
infection in a patient with signs and symptoms compatible 
with HEV infection, e.g., jaundice and/or dark urine and 
pale feces. To ensure no false-positive results, additional 
testing was conducted on samples taken at least 1 month 
later from these IgM-seropositive participants.
We compared risk factors and exposure for those with 
recent acute infection with those for seronegative controls. 
Persons who had evidence of past infection were excluded 
because they had probably been immune during the study 
period. Single and multivariable logistic regression, using 
Stata statistical software, release 10.1 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX, USA), was performed to identify the most 
likely cause of the outbreak and to estimate time and place 
of exposure. Specifi c exposures with estimated odds ratios 
(ORs) >1, p<0.2, and at least 50% of cases of recent acute 
HEV infection, were included in a multivariable model. 
The least signifi cant factor was dropped from the model in 
a stepwise fashion until all remaining exposures exhibited 
a signifi cant association: p<0.05 and OR >1.
After the multivariable model was fi nalized, we added 
each port visited, 1 at a time, to identify where participants 
may have been exposed to HEV. The interaction between 
food item and location was also considered by using a 
stricter selection criterion of signifi cance level p<0.01.

ipants. Of these 659, age range was 22–92 years old (mean 
age 68 years); >90% participants were 55–79 years of age. 
Of 789 participants who gave blood samples, 426 (54%) 
were female and 363 (46%) were male.
Laboratory
Including the 4 case-patients identifi ed on the cruise, 
33 (4%) participants were classifi ed as having had recent 
acute infections. A fall in IgM titer with a rise in IgG ti￾ter in the second sample collected 1 month later confi rmed 
the acute infections. Another 162 (21%) were classifi ed as 
having had past infection and 594 (75%) as having had no 
infection (Figure). Genotyping of RNA sequences obtained 
from 3 case-patients found genotype 3 virus with sequence 
homology close to that of other genotype 3 viruses reported 
throughout Europe.
Statistical Analyses
Univariate analysis showed no statistical association 
between acute HEV infection and age group (Table 1). In￾fection was associated with gender; women were less likely 
than men to have been infected during the cruise. Some 
evidence indicated association with alcohol consumption; 
all nondrinkers were HEV negative, and those who drank 
alcohol (past or present) were more likely to have been in￾fected. Alcohol was consumed by ≈84% of participants, 
11% of whom exceeded the recommended weekly intake 
(defi ned as a maximum weekly intake of 21 units for men 
and 14 units for women). Medical conditions, including 
liver disease, did not appear to be signifi cant risk factors.
Odds of becoming infected were higher for passen￾gers who had embarked from Southampton than for pas￾sengers who had joined the cruise at other ports (p<0.001). 
No evidence of association with recent HEV infection was 
found at any of the ports visited. Of those exposures ashore 
within the risk period, only excursions in Honolulu, Ha￾waii, USA (OR 2.22, 95% confi dence interval [CI] 0.89–
5.49, p = 0.086), and Pago Pago, Samoa (OR 3.26, 95% CI 
1.41–7.53, p = 0.006), were signifi cantly associated with 
infection.
Of the potential exposures on board, univariate analy￾sis showed the following to be signifi cantly associated with 
infection: unpasteurized cheese, paté, venison, and shell￾fi sh (Table 2). When shellfi sh were further differentiated 
(prawns, lobster, crab, mussels, scallops), the association 
appeared to be signifi cant for lobster and crab; however, 
few HEV-positive participants said that they had eaten lob￾ster (n = 9) or crab (n = 4). The fi nal multivariable model 
(Table 3) showed the following to be associated with HEV 
infection: being male, drinking alcohol, and eating shellfi sh 
while on board.
Recent Acute Infections 
Of the 33 participants who had had recent acute infec￾tions, 25 (76%) were men 57–87 years of age (mean 68 
years), and most (76%) were taking medication. All had 
drunk alcohol, 7 (21%) of whom had exceeded the recom￾mended weekly units. Only 11 had symptoms compatible 
with hepatitis; 22 (67%) had either no symptoms or non￾specifi c symptoms of a cold (Figure). Age, gender distribu￾tion, and the proportion receiving medication were similar 
among those who were symptomatic (8 [73%] were male, 
average age 68 years; 8 [73%] were taking medication) or 
asymptomatic (13 [76%] were male, average age 69 years; 
12 [71%] were taking medication). However, 4 (36%) 
symptomatic participants had consumed excess alcohol 
compared with only 1 (6%) asymptomatic participant.
Symptom onset was during March 6–24 (mode March 
8, median March 12). Of the 11 symptomatic passengers, 5 
had visited the ship’s doctor 3–5 days after symptom onset, 
3 had been hospitalized, and 6 reported having been sick 
for 6–21 days (median 12 days).

Hepatitis E on Cruise Ship
Of the 11 (33%) participants who met the case defi nition 
for symptomatic hepatitis, all had loss of appetite, malaise, 
dark urine, and nausea. Other signs were jaundice and vom￾iting (n = 7); abdominal pain or discomfort or pale stools (n 
= 5); and headache, weakness, shakiness, joint pain, rash, 
or depression. Weeks later, a second phase of illness was 
reported by 2 participants; both experienced abdominal 
pain or discomfort, and 1 also had dark urine and lethargy. 
Blood test results for bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were available for 10 
of 11 participants with symptomatic hepatitis. Levels >2×
the expected maximum were found for bilirubin (n = 6), 
alanine aminotransferase (n = 5), and alkaline phosphatase 
(n = 2). Aspartate aminotransferase levels were reported for 
only 3 participants with symptomatic hepatitis and were el￾evated for 2. Subsequent testing for 2 case-patients showed 
that liver function had returned to within reference limits. 
Liver function test results were also reported for 14 of 22 
participants who did not have symptomatic hepatitis; none 
were appreciably elevated. Blood samples from this group 
were taken later than for those with symptomatic hepatitis, 
so the possibility of abnormal liver function in the earlier 
phase of infection cannot be excluded.
Exposure Period and Potential Source of Infection
Our analysis suggests that passengers were at higher 
risk for HEV infection if they were on the cruise from Janu￾ary 7, when the ship left Southampton, until February 14, 
when it arrived in Sydney. Most of those with recent acute 
HEV infection had embarked (January 7) and disembarked

(March 28) in Southampton. However, 6 passengers, who 
were later seropositive, disembarked in New Zealand or 
Australia and 1 embarked in San Francisco and disem￾barked in Hong Kong. These dates indicate that the second 
leg of the cruise, from San Francisco (January 26) to Auck￾land (February 11), was the likely exposure period and sug￾gest that the outbreak incubation period was 25–40 days.
A symptomatic case-patient who had late-onset disease 
had shared a cabin with a case-patient who had early-onset 
disease; the late-onset disease was potentially a secondary 
infection. Excluding this possible secondary case from re￾peat statistical analyses did not affect our results.
Information about onshore activity during this likely 
exposure period, including organized excursions, was 
available for 32 of 33 participants who had had recent 
acute infections. All 32 had gone ashore in Honolulu, Pago 
Pago, and Auckland. However, no common activities or 
excursions were noted, and most did not consume any food 
while ashore, except in Auckland. A variety of foods were 
consumed while ashore, and no common food was iden￾tifi ed. Overall, analysis of excursions and food and drink 
consumed while ashore during the second leg of the cruise 
found no evidence that the infection was acquired while 
ashore.
Association between shellfi sh consumption while on 
board and recent HEV infection was further investigated. 
All seafood had been frozen; most was put on board in 
Southampton, but some was sent later from the United 
Kingdom or purchased in Australia. Lists of seafood used 
on board during the cruise were provided by the cruise ship 
company. Seafood was served on 34 of 38 days between 
Southampton and Sydney. Prawns and mixed seafood 
(mixture of shrimp or small prawns, salmon, cod, mussels, 
hake, and squid) were served most frequently. Implicating 
any particular shellfi sh was diffi cult because crab, lobster, 
mussels, scallops, shrimp, prawns and mixed seafood were 
all served at least 1 time during the suspect period of travel 
between San Francisco and Auckland.
Discussion
This hepatitis E outbreak among passengers during a 
3-month world cruise was reported at the end of the cruise, 
after passengers had already disembarked and returned 
home. Nevertheless, the fact that approximately one third 
of eligible passengers were able to give blood samples 
within a short time enabled detection of an acute antibody 
response. The testing algorithm was adopted on the basis of 
the onset dates of the fi rst 4 cases and the expected time de￾lay between contacting the passengers and actually receiv￾ing samples in the laboratory for testing. It was therefore 
thought to be unlikely that screening for HEV RNA would 
provide a useful marker of recent acute infection.
One study limitation was that participants were self-se￾lected and may not therefore represent a random sample of 
passengers on the cruise. Also, the time between the cruise 
and completion of questionnaires may have made recalling 
foods consumed during the cruise diffi cult. However, most 
returned questionnaires were completed comprehensively, 
leaving no reason to suspect differential recall between 
case-patients and others.
Evidence of recent acute hepatitis E infection was 
found for 33 participants. The evidence of past infections 
for 162 (21%) is consistent with hepatitis E seropositive 
rates of ≈25% of UK residents >55 years of age (9). Only 
11 participants with acute infection reported illness com￾patible with hepatitis; 22 (two thirds) were asymptomatic 
or had unrelated symptoms. This investigation provided a 
unique opportunity to diagnose asymptomatic infection in 
an exposed group and found a much higher asymptomatic 
rate than previously reported (≈3%–4%) (3,10). Elevated 
liver function test results appeared to be associated with 
symptomatic cases; however, because those without appar￾ent clinical signs were tested a longer time after exposure, 
their liver function could have returned to within reference 
limits.
HEV RNA was detected in only 3 case-patients, sug￾gesting that RNA had cleared by the time most samples 
were tested. Virus RNA sequences were identical and be￾longed to genotype 3, suggesting a common-source out￾break. Genotype 3 is the main type of HEV found in indus￾trialized counties, including the United Kingdom. Although 
it has also been reported in North America, Southeast Asia, 
Australia, and New Zealand (4), the genotype 3 virus found 
in this outbreak had close sequence homology with geno￾type 3 strains reported in Europe.
The evidence implicates the second leg of the cruise 
(January 26–February 11). Although infection could have

been acquired while ashore, the epidemiologic investiga￾tion suggests that exposure occurred while on board the 
ship. The estimated incubation period for this outbreak, 
25–40 days, is shorter than but within the range of the re￾ported incubation period for hepatitis E (15–60 days) (3).
The 3 associated risk factors (gender, age, shellfi sh 
consumption) remained signifi cant in multivariate analy￾sis. First, male passengers were more likely to have been 
infected than female passengers; 76% of recent acute in￾fections were in men. A marked excess of indigenously ac￾quired HEV cases in middle-age and elderly men has been 
reported in England, Wales (5), and other European coun￾tries (10–12). Our study suggests that this observed excess 
is not caused by ascertainment bias because men are at 
higher risk for disease, but rather it appears to be a genuine 
difference in exposure. Second, alcohol consumption was 
associated with recent infection. Although excess alcohol 
consumption could compromise hepatic function and pre￾dispose to symptomatic hepatitis E infection, as suggested 
by our study, alcohol consumption is probably not causally 
linked to exposure. The association may indicate a propen￾sity for risk behavior that could not be controlled for in 
the analysis. Third, consumption of shellfi sh on board the 
ship was strongly associated with HEV infection. Further 
analysis did not implicate a particular type of shellfi sh, and 
cross-contamination of shellfi sh from a single vehicle is 
possible, but because the virus is waterborne and has been 
shown to contaminate shellfi sh (13–15), this association is 
biologically plausible. Other studies have shown that HEV 
can be foodborne, and illness has been linked to consump￾tion of undercooked or raw meat (16–18).
Many of the 33 recent acute HEV infections, predomi￾nantly in men who drank alcohol, were asymptomatic and 
would otherwise have gone undiagnosed. We found no 
evidence of continuing transmission, other than 1 potential 
secondary case, or of any breaches of public health stan￾dards on board the ship. However, the analytical study and 
supporting genotype fi ndings challenged the initial assump￾tion that the outbreak was due to infection acquired while 
ashore. This investigation suggests that shellfi sh, which are 
known to be a common source of other viral infections, are 
a potential source of HEV infection in Europe.
