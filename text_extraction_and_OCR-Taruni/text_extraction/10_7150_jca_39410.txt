Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting beads 
transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) with CalliSpheres microspheres (CSM) in treating 
unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). 
Methods: 88 unresectable ICC patients who received DEB-TACE treatment with CSM were 
retrospectively enrolled in this study. Information about treatment response, survival and adverse events 
were collected. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS), and factors affecting OS were determined by Cox’s proportional hazards regression model. 
Results: Tumor response of the whole sample of 88 patients was partial response (PR) in 58 (65.9%) 
patients, stable disease (SD) in 19 (21.6%) and progressive disease (PD) in 11 (12.5%) at one month after 
therapy, with no complete responses (CR). The median PFS and OS were 3.0 months and 9.0 months 
respectively. Cox’s proportional hazards regression analysis disclosed that subsequent treatment was an 
independent favorable prognostic factor, while cholangiectasis, extensive intrahepatic tumor burden and 
extrahepatic metastasis were the three prognostic factors associated with poor survival in ICC patients. 
Besides, common adverse events included nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain and transient elevation of 
liver transaminase in patients treated by DEB-TACE with CSM.
Conclusion: DEB-TACE with CSM is safe and well-tolerated for unresectable ICC patients, with a low 
complication rate and a relative benefit in terms of survival. Subsequent treatments including 
systemic/loco-regional treatments is an independent favorable prognostic factor, but cholangiectasis,
extensive intrahepatic tumor burden and extrahepatic metastases are the three prognostic factors 
associated with poor survival.

Introduction
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a fatal 
primary liver cancer arising from the epithelial lining 
of the peripheral intrahepatic bile duct epithelium [1]. 
As the second most common type of primary liver 
cancer, ICC has more aggressive tumor behaviors 
than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), resulting in a

devastating prognosis and high mortality rate[2].
Liver resection is the mainstay treatment of this 
disease [1]. Unfortunately, most patients with ICC are 
found to have locally advanced or metastatic disease 
at the time of diagnosis. Even after resection with 
curative intent, early recurrence and metastasis are 
very common and the prognosis remains very poor
[3-4]. Therefore, it is of great necessity to investigate in 
non-surgical and locoregional treatments to provide 
survival benefits for unresectable ICC patients.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), as one 
of the most commonly applied non-surgical 
locoregional treatments for liver cancers, has been 
illustrated by accumulating clinical researches to 
effectively diminish tumor tissue and improve the 
prognosis of liver cancer patients [5-7]. Traditionally, 
the drug carrier used in TACE is lipiodol, which has 
strong liquidity and relatively weak sustained-release 
effect resulting in systemic toxicity. Therefore, other 
interventional embolic materials such as drug-eluting 
beads (DEB) have been investigated as replacements
for lipiodol to better load and release drugs in TACE 
treatment [8]. 
As a novel type of drug-eluting microspheres, 
CalliSpheres microspheres (CSM) is the first 
microsphere product independently researched and 
developed in China, and it has been applied in the 
treatment of Chinese HCC patients with quite 
promising clinical outcomes [8]. However, CSM has 
just been launched to the market and the number of 
studies about DEB-TACE with CSM in liver cancers is 
still small. Besides, there is currently no research on 
the treatment efficacy of DEB-TACE with CSM in 
unresectable ICC patients as far as we know. 
Therefore, we summarized the short-term efficacy
and perioperative complications of this therapeutic
scheme by collecting and analyzing the clinical data of
88 consecutive patients with unresectable ICC who
accepted DEB-TACE treatment with CSM in our
center from November 2015 and May 2018, with an
attempt to further clarify its safety and effectiveness
as well as factors influencing the prognosis. 
Methods 
Patients 
From November 2015 and May 2018, 88 patients 
with unresectable ICC who received DEB-TACE in 
the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, 
Zhejiang University were included in this 
retrospectively study. The inclusion criteria were: (1) 
diagnosed as ICC confirmed by liver biopsy (58 cases) 
or postoperative pathological examinations (30 cases); 
(2) underwent DEB-TACE treatment using CSM; (3) 
clinical data and follow-up records were completely 
reserved and accessible. Patients who complicated 
with other malignancies or whose medical records 
were incomplete were excluded from the study. The 
present study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital, College 
of Medicine, Zhejiang University, and written 
informed consents were obtained from all the patients 
or their statutory guardians.
Data collection 
Patients’ baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics were collected from electronic medical 
records, including age, gender, ECOG performance 
status, Child-Pugh classification, laboratory and 
pathologic parameters, radiological characteristics 
and treatment courses.
Process of drug loading 
Before the initiation of DEB-TACE, the 
concentrated solution of epirubicin was prepared 
with 4 ml of sterile water for injection and 80 mg of 
epirubicin hydrochloride, and the concentration was
20 mg/ml. Then the CSM (diameter 100–300μm) were 
loaded with epirubicin as follows: firstly, the CSM 
and sterile water were extracted by a 20 mL syringe 
and inverted placed for 5 min until the CSM were 
totally precipitated, then pushed out the supernatant 
liquor. Subsequently, the concentrated solution of 
epirubicin was mixed with the CSM using a tee joint 
and then stored by a syringe, and the syringe 
containing the mixture of CSM and epirubicin 
solution was placed at room temperature and shaken 
gently every 5 min until almost all epirubicin were 
loaded (loading time more than 30 min). After that, 
the nonionic contrast medium (iodixanol [320 mg 
I/mL], Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine, Jiangsu, China) 
was added into the mixture as a 1:1 ratio and the 
mixture were kept still for 5 min for further 
application.
Procedures of DEB-TACE
Before DEB-TACE, the examinations of whole 
blood, routine biochemistry, coagulation function and 
serum tumor markers were performed, and 
contrast-enhanced abdominal computerized 
tomography (CT) or gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for 
all patients. After local anesthesia, angiography was 
performed to detect tumor feeders using Seldinger's 
technique through a transfemoral approach, which 
included the hepatic artery, superior mesenteric 
artery and the inferior phrenic artery, as well as other 
visceral arteries if necessary. When the tumor feeders 
were identified, 2.4-F to 2.8-F microcatheter was 
recommended to use for a segment or subsegment 
super-selective catheterization of tumor feeders. 
Subsequently, the mixture of CSM and nonionic 

Journal of Cancer 2020, Vol. 11

4536
contrast medium was injected into the tumor feeders 
through the microcatheter at a speed of 1 mL/min. 
When blood flow slowed or the small branch of portal 
vein appeared, the embolization stopped. When the 
angiography showed tumors staining disappeared or 
disappeared mostly, the operation finished. 
Embospheres or PVA particles could be added if 
necessary. All patients were treated with symptomatic 
support such as routine liver protection, pain relief, 
antiemetics and prophylactic anti-infection after 
DEB-TACE.
Assessment and follow up
Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT or gadoxetic 
acid-enhanced liver MRI examination was performed 
one month after the first DEB-TACE treatment and 
then every 4-6weeks to assess response to treatment. 
The treatment response including complete response 
(CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and 
progressive disease (PD) was assessed according to 
the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (mRECIST)[9]. All adverse events(AEs) were 
recorded and evaluated using the five grade Common 
Therapy Evaluation Program’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE 
version 5.0)[10]. For patients with multiple diseases, 
the two largest focus was selected for response 
assessment. The overall response rate (ORR) was 
defined as CR+PR. All patients were followed up by 
calls, outpatient service and hospitalization for 1-43 
months, and no patients lost follow-up. The last 
follow-up date was 2019/6/30. Progression-free 
survival (PFS) was defined as the time from 
DEB-TACE treatment to disease progression or 
patients’ death; overall survival (OS) was defined as 
the time from DEB-TACE treatment to patients’ death 
or the last follow-up date.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with the use of 
SPSS 22.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
USA). Count data were expressed as count 
(percentage). Survival characteristics were shown 
using the Kaplan–Meier curve, and the univariate and 
multivariate Cox’s proportional hazards regression 
analyses were used to determine prognostic factors of 
OS. P-value <0.05 was considered significant.

Treatment response 
A total of one hundred and twenty-six 
DEB-TACE procedures were carried out and 1.43 
DEB-TACE sessions were carried out per patient 
(range 1 – 5). Most of them were treated only one time 
(n=64), only fourteen patients for two and seven for 3 
sessions. There were 31 cases combined with TAI of 
oxaliplatin(n=26) or raltitrexed(n=5). In the 
posttreatment evaluation and according to mRECIST 
criteria, 58 patients (65.9 %) met PR criteria, 19 (21.6 
%) were SD, and 11 were PD (12.5%) and no CR was 
observed (Table 2). The overall response rate (ORR) 
to DEB-TACE with CSM in unresectable ICC patients 
was 65.9%.
Patients’ survival profiles 
Kaplan–Meier curve was used to estimate PFS 
and OS of unresectable ICC patients underwent 
DEB-TACE with CSM, which exhibited that the 
median PFS was 3.0 months and the median OS was 
9.0 months (Figure 1). 
Factors affecting OS in unresectable ICC 
patients 
Information from 88 unresectable ICC patients 
treated with DEB-TACE with CSM was included in 
Cox’s proportional hazard regression model analysis 
(Table 3). Univariate regression analysis exhibited 
that previous treatment (HR=0.491, p=0.010), 
subsequent treatment (HR=0.408, p=0.001) and 
combined treatment (HR = 0.445, P = 0.001) were 
correlated with better OS, whereas tumor size (HR = 
2.943, P<0.001), vascular invasion (HR = 2.467, 
P<0.001), cholangiectasis (HR = 3.215, P < 0.001), 
extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 2.011, P = 0.005),CA-125 
(HR = 1.658, P = 0.042), CA-199 (HR = 2.145, P = 0.002) 
and tumor burden (P < 0.001) were associated with 
worse OS in unresectable ICC patients. Multivariate 
regression analysis presented that subsequent 
treatment (HR = 0.519, P =0.020) independently 
predicted longer OS, while cholangiectasis (HR = 
2.718, P < 0.001), extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 1.776, 
P = 0.033) and tumor burden (P = 0.011) 
independently predicted worse OS in unresectable 
ICC patients. In addition, factors that independently 
predicted longer OS were selected for further 
subgroup analysis, and the result elucidated that OS 
was better in patients with subsequent treatment 
(Figure 2A), without cholangiectasis (Figure 2B) and 
extrahepatic metastasis (Figure 2C) as well as lower 
tumor burden (Figure 2D). 
Adverse events after treatment 
After 126 DEB-TACE sessions, the major AEs
included vomiting/nausea (77.0%), right upper
quadrant pain (61.1%), transient elevation of liver 
transaminase (54.0%) and low-grade fever (46.0%).
One patient occurred myasthenia of the lower limbs 
for cerebral infarction and fully recovered after 
neurotrophic treatment for one week. Other
complications were resolved 3–5 days after
symptomatic supports including analgesia and to stop
vomiting. The minor AEs were mainly associated
with chemotherapy drugs or post-embolization
syndrome. They were mild or moderate, mainly in
grades 1–2 (Table 4).

Discussion
ICC is a highly lethal hepatobiliary neoplasm 
whose incidence has been increasing steadily and 
substantially over the last few decades globally. 
Surgical resection is the potentially curative treatment 
option for patients with resectable ICC, and arterially 
directed therapies are generally accepted treatments 
for unresectable ICC according to the NCCN 
guidelines.TACE is a promising, minimally invasive

intra-arterial therapy for unresectable liver tumors
[11]. It allows the delivery of high doses of 
chemotherapeutic drugs directly to the tumor with 
very little systemic drug exposure and has become a 
valid alternative to systemic chemotherapy for 
unresectable ICC [12]. Compared with conventional 
lipiodol-TACE, DEB-TACE is superior to lipiodol in 
drug loading and releasing as well as embolization 
effects, is increasingly used in the treatment of ICC
[11,13]. 
Several studies have been published reporting 
the efficacy of DEB-TACE in treating ICC patients. 
Research by Aliberti C et al [14] revealed that for ICC 
patients underwent DEB-TACE with DC-Beads or 
Lifepearls drug-eluting microspheres loaded with
doxorubicin, the PR, SD, PD and DCR were 15%, 80%, 
5% and 95% at 3 months after treatment according to
RECIST 1.1 criteria. Besides, Kuhlmann JB et al.[13]
adopted irinotecan-eluting beads treating 26 
unresectable ICC patients and revealed that PR, SD 
and PD rates were 4%, 42% and 50% at 2 months after 
treatment according to RECIST criteria, while the 
mean PFS and OS were 3.9 months and 11.7months 
respectively. Venturini M et al[15] treated 10 patients
affected by multiple liver metastases from
cholangiocarcinoma with DEB preloaded with
irinotecan (DEBIRI) or doxorubicin (DEBDOX) as
second-line treatment, resulting in a significantly
longer PFS(12.67 weeks for DEBIRI and 15.78 weeks
for DEBDOX) and OS (45 weeks in DEBIRI and 48.9
weeks in DEBDOX) after 32 TACE procedures.
However, these previous studies were limited in
several classical types of DEBs with only a small
number of patients and for this reason, clinicians are
still skeptical on its efficacy for ICC therapy [13-14].
CSM, which is the first DEB product 
independently researched and developed in China 
with good biocompatibility, suspension property, and 
flexibility, is a type of ion-exchange bead with some 
negatively charged functional groups. These 
negatively charged functional groups are responsible 
for the loading of many positively charged drugs, 
such as irinotecan and doxorubicin [16-17]. In vitro 
experiments have shown that approximately 90% of 
doxorubicin can be sequestered into a vial of 100–300 
μm CSM within 30 min under given conditions [16]. 
Recently, several clinical studies have reported the 
safety and effectiveness of DEB-TACE with CSM for 
the treatment of liver cancer, with the results proved 
that CSM was efficient and well-tolerated not only in 
treating patients with HCC but also in secondary liver 
cancer[11,17]. 
In this study, 88 unresectable ICC patients 
received 126 DEB-TACE procedures with CSM loaded 
with epirubicin. Regarding tumor response, PR was 
achieved in 58 patients (65.9%), SD in 19 (21.6%) and 
PD in 11 (12.5%) at 1 month after treatment according 
to mRECIST criteria. Therefore, the ORR was 65.9%, 
which were similar or superior rates in previous
studies. While the median PFS and OS were 3.0 
months and 9.0 months respectively in our cohort, 
which was numerically lower than that of previous 
studies. The possible reason was that patients in our 
study were mainly multiple ICC patients (70.5%) and 
most of them only received one cycle (72.7%) of 
DEB-TACE treatment for financial reasons, which 
might reduce treatment efficacy and influence 
prognosis of ICC patients. Although these results 
were not in accordance with previous studies, this is 
the first study with a relatively larger sample size 
suggesting its feasibility and effectivity for 
DEB-TACE with CSM in treating unresectable ICC.
Many studies looked into the prognostic factors 
that predicted the survival outcomes in ICC. Various 
studies including the present study have shown 
extensive intrahepatic tumor burden and extrahepatic 
metastases to predict poor survival outcomes [18-21]. 
Most extrahepatic metastasis occurs in patients with 
advanced intrahepatic tumor stage [12]. Therefore, the 
absence of extrahepatic metastasis was associated 
with a significantly increased median OS [22-23]. 
Zhang XF et al[24] had explored the prognostic 
implication of the number and station of lymph node 
metastasis (LNM) for patients with ICC by using the 
SEER registry and found that patients with 1 or 2 
LNM had comparable worse OS versus patients with 
no nodal disease (median OS, 1 LNM 18.0, 2 LNM 20.0 
vs no LNM 45.0 months, both P < 0.001).In this cohort, 
the median OS for patients with or without 
extrahepatic metastasis were 8.0 months and 12.0 
months respectively (HR = 1.776, P = 0.033). Tumor 
burden is an important factor in defining prognosis 
among patients with primary and secondary liver 
cancers [18,25].Extensive intrahepatic tumor burden 
might reflect elevated disease severity as well as less
hepatic functional reserve, thereby led to poor
survival after DEB-TACE treatment in ICC
patients[26]. In our study, the median OS for patients
with different intrahepatic tumor burden were 15.0
months (≤25%), 9.0 months (≤50%) and 5.0 months
(>50%) respectively (P = 0.011).
It is well known that ICC is one of the most 
refractory and vicious tumors, so a multidisciplinary 
approach to treatment is necessary. As combining 
DEB-TACE with systemic/loco-regional treatments

=0.020) in our cohort. Cholangiectasis from bile duct 
stricture due to the tumor, as one of the important
clinicopathological appearances of ICC[27], was 
closely associated with malignant tumor had 
infiltrated into the bile duct and increased risk of 
infection after DEB-TACE treatment, which might 
worsen OS in HCC patients[27-29]. In our study,
subgroup analysis showed the median OS for patients 
with or without cholangiectasis were 12.0 months and 
6.0 months respectively (HR = 2.718, P < 0.001). As far 
as we know, it’s the first report that revealed the 
relationship between cholangiectasis and prognosis of 
ICC, and further researches are needed to further 
confirm.
Besides treatment response and survival, 
DEB-TACE has also been reported to be at least as 
tolerable as traditional TACE in previous studies 
about liver cancers, and the common adverse events 
are pain, vomiting, nausea and fever [8,30]. As for the 
safety profiles of DEB-TACE in the treatment of 
unresectable ICC, the most prevalent adverse events 
are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and
transaminase rise [14]. In line with this evidence, our 
study observed that the common adverse events of 
DEB-TACE with CSM in unresectable ICC patients 
were mild or moderate post-embolization syndrome 
(composed of right upper quadrant pain and 
nausea/vomiting) and chemotherapy-associated 
toxicities, which demonstrated the relatively good 
safety of this treatment.
Our study has several important limitations.
First, the population size of this study is relatively 
small, although this is the largest study from a single 
center with CSM in DEB-TACE treatment for 
unresectable ICC patients. Second, the follow-up time 
is relatively short. Therefore, the long-term efficacy 
and safety of DEB-TACE with CSM in unresectable 
ICC patients are not assessed and the results must be 
taken as preliminary. Third, this study has not a 
control group. We are currently enrolling patients into 
a randomized controlled phase II study, and the 
results from this single-group preliminary study can 
be further validated in the randomized controlled 
phase II study. 
Conclusion
Although the present preliminary study is 
clearly limited by its retrospective and 
nonrandomized study design, this is the first report 
demonstrates that DEB-TACE with CSM is safe and 
well-tolerated for unresectable ICC patients, with a 
low complication rate and a relative benefit in terms 
of survival. Subsequent treatments including 
systemic/loco-regional treatments is an independent 
favorable prognostic factor, but cholangiectasis,
extensive intrahepatic tumor burden and extrahepatic 
metastases are the three prognostic factors associated 
with poor survival. On the whole, our preliminary 
research shows a promising perspective for future 
randomized controlled phase II study that will focus 
on the effectiveness and safety of CSM in unresectable 
ICC patients.
