The acquired or perinatal form of biliary atresia is a Th1
fibro-inflammatory disease affecting both the extrahepatic and
intrahepatic bile ducts. Osteopontin (OPN) is a Th1 cytokine
implicated in several fibro-inflammatory and autoimmune dis￾eases. We examined the expression of OPN in acquired biliary
atresia in comparison to normal liver and several pediatric cho￾lestatic liver diseases. We also assessed OPN expression by
cultured human bile duct epithelial cells. We found that liver
OPN mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased
in biliary atresia versus normal and other cholestatic diseases.
OPN expression in biliary atresia was localized to epithelium of
proliferating biliary structures (ductules and/or ducts) and bile
plugs contained therein. No portal biliary OPN expression could
be demonstrated in normal liver, syndromic biliary atresia, bili￾ary obstruction not due to biliary atresia, and idiopathic neonatal
hepatitis. OPN expression by human bile duct epithelial cells in
culture was responsive to IL-2 and TNF-. Our results demon￾strate an up-regulation of OPN expression by interlobular biliary
epithelium in biliary atresia, which correlates with biliary pro￾liferation and portal fibrosis. These findings suggest a role for
OPN in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia. (Pediatr Res 57:

Biliary atresia is the most common liver disease of infancy
that leads to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and the need for
liver transplantation (1). A small proportion of cases are
thought to be congenital in that they are associated with other
developmental anomalies, whereas most cases are diagnosed at
4 – 8 wk of age and appear to represent a disease acquired in
perinatal or neonatal life. The etiology and pathogenesis of
biliary atresia remain unknown. A current working unifying
hypothesis that can explain the clinical and pathologic features
of the acquired form of biliary atresia is that some injury to the
bile ducts, likely a perinatal viral infection, leads to an auton￾omous immune response that results in progressive bile duct
injury and fibrosis (2). This progressive, inflammatory cholan￾giopathy results in extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (1,3). The
extrahepatic bile duct is partially or entirely obliterated by
fibrosis in association with inflammation within the fibrous
remnant. The intrahepatic biliary system also appears to be
affected by the primary disease process. Portal areas are ex￾panded with fibrosis and exhibit marked proliferation of biliary
elements (ductules and/or ducts) (4 – 8). These duct structures
often contain bile plugs. Biliary proliferation may still be a
feature of the disease even at end-stage, but in some cases all
duct structures disappear.
Previous studies have shown that the mononuclear inflam￾matory infiltrate in the portal tracts comprises macrophages,
CD4 T-cells and NK cells (9 –13). We have shown that the
inflammation is typically Th1 in character, in that it consists
mainly of macrophages, CD4 T-cells and CD8 T-cells with
production of IL-2, IFN-, TNF- and IL-12 (14). The inciting
agent leading to this inflammation and the processes leading to
bile duct destruction remain unknown.

ABSTRACT
837

Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphorylated glycoprotein that is
synthesized and secreted by a variety of cell types, including
chondrocytes, several types of immune cells, smooth muscle
cells, vascular endothelium, and some epithelia (15–17). It has
many functions in both physiologic and pathologic processes
(16 –18). It is involved in macrophage recruitment during
inflammation, acts as a survival or mitogenic factor for epithe￾lial and vascular cells, and is associated with extracellular
matrix synthesis and fibrosis (17,19 –24). It is involved in the
pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases
including renal tubulointerstitial injury and atherosclerosis
(23–32). Most germane to this work is its role as a Th1
cytokine (33,34). OPN stimulates T-cell proliferation and in￾duces T-cells and macrophages to express other Th1 cytokines
(33,35). Recent studies have shown an important proinflam￾matory role for OPN in autoimmune diseases including rheu￾matoid arthritis (36 –38), multiple sclerosis (15,39,40) and
autoimmune myocarditis (41). It is also a key cytokine in
granulomatous inflammation (42,43).
Little is known about OPN in liver disease. Carbon tetra￾chloride intoxication in the rat has been shown to increase liver
OPN expression that was localized mainly to Kupffer cells,
macrophages and stellate cells (44). Human recombinant OPN
had a positive effect on rat hepatic macrophage migration in
vitro (44). These data suggest that OPN could play an impor￾tant role in recruiting inflammation to the liver and promoting
fibrosis in parenchymal liver diseases. In addition, marked
expression of OPN has been observed in hepatocellular carci￾noma (45– 47). We recently found that increased hepatic ex￾pression of OPN is involved in the development of liver injury
and fibrosis in dietary murine models of nonalcoholic steato￾hepatitis (NASH) (48,49). We have demonstrated that OPN is
synthesized and secreted by cultured hepatocytes; synthesis is
up-regulated by TNF-, TGF-, and leptin. In the experimen￾tal animal model, increased hepatocyte OPN expression pre￾ceded the development of hepatitis and fibrosis and was asso￾ciated with increases in collagen 1 mRNA expression. OPN￾null mice exposed to the same experimental conditions had
marked reduction in serum ALT compared with wild-type
littermates and did not develop hepatic fibrosis. We concluded
from these studies that OPN is involved in the progression of
hepatic fibrosis in this experimental model of NASH. There are
few data regarding OPN in biliary tract diseases. Hepatic OPN
expression is increased in primary biliary cirrhosis (50,51). A
gene chip array analysis showed that OPN was the most highly
over expressed gene in biliary atresia relative to cholestatic
control livers (52). This finding suggests a potential importance
for OPN in the Th1 mediated fibro-inflammatory process that
characterizes biliary atresia.
In the present study, we sought to determine the expression
of OPN in biliary atresia. We used quantitative methods to
measure OPN mRNA and protein expression in liver samples
and examined its localization by immunohistochemistry. We
also determined if the pattern of OPN expression is specific to
biliary atresia by examining it in other childhood cholestatic
diseases. To verify our findings regarding biliary OPN expres￾sion, we examined whether cultured human bile duct epithelial
cells synthesize OPN.
METHODS
We examined surgical biopsies of 13 infants with typical biliary atresia
obtained at the time of diagnosis when the infants were undergoing portoen￾terostomy and hepatic explants of nine patients with advanced biliary atresia
(Table 1). None of these patients had other developmental anomalies and were
considered to have the acquired form of the disease. We also examined surgical
biopsies of four infants with syndromic biliary atresia obtained when the
infants were undergoing portoenterostomy. These infants had anatomic anom￾alies of abdominal situs typical for the condition. For comparison to biliary
atresia at the time of diagnosis, we examined biopsy samples obtained during
diagnostic evaluation from ten infants with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis and
during surgery from six infants with bile duct obstruction not due to biliary
atresia. We also examined hepatic explants from five patients with Alagille
syndrome. Finally, we examined liver from two groups of “normal” children:
one group comprised of nine deceased liver donors, and the other comprised of
four children with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis and completely normal

hepatic histopathology undergoing mesenteric to left portal vein bypass (53).
We reviewed our pathology archives of hilar remnants obtained from infants
with biliary atresia undergoing portoenterostomy and identified two samples
that contained biliary epithelium. We identified one example of normal infant
extrahepatic bile duct (a 5-wk old deceased donor) for comparison.
Liver samples were collected from infants with biliary atresia during
portoenterostomy and from children with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis
during mesenteric to left portal vein bypass surgery. Surgical biopsy samples
were wrapped in tinfoil, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80° C until analysis. Liver samples from child-aged deceased liver donors,
advanced biliary atresia and Alagille syndrome were obtained during trans￾plantation procedures. The liver was immediately cubed, snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80° C until analysis. Formalin-fixed and paraffin￾imbedded specimens for histology and immunostaining were obtained from
our pathology archives. These studies were approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Children’s Memorial Hospital. Informed consent was ob￾tained from parents to perform this study.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed liver tissue was
processed and 5 m thick paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H & E) and Masson’s trichrome stain for histologic analysis. A
hepatopathologist (HMA) scored the portal findings of all sections according to
the following scales. Fibrosis and inflammation were graded on 4-point scales
as follows. Portal fibrosis: 1  none, 2  increased without bridging, 3 
bridging, 4  cirrhosis. Inflammation: 1  minimal or normal, 2  mildly
increased, 3  moderately increased, 4  severe inflammation. The number of
duct or ductular contours in all portal areas contained in the section was
counted and averaged. The number of portal areas sampled varied according to
the source of the material examined. For percutaneous biopsy samples from
neonatal hepatitis the number of portal areas ranged from 4 –11 (median 7),
whereas for all other samples, the number exceeded 20. Paucity/proliferation
was graded as: 1  complete absence of ducts, 2  paucity of ducts (0  0.5
ducts per portal area), 3  normal (0.5 – 2 ducts per portal area), 4  duct or
ductular proliferation (2 profiles per portal area).
Osteopontin immunostaining was performed using a Vectastain Elite ABC
kit and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, washed, and preincubated in blocking
solution followed by incubation with a monoclonal anti-human OPN antibody
(Assay Design, Ann Arbor, MI). Sections were then incubated with biotinyl￾ated secondary antibody, washed, covered with DAB, and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Sections treated with nonspecific IgG were used as negative
controls. The walls of blood vessels stain positively for OPN in some samples,
which provides an internal positive control. In addition, mouse kidney samples
were used as a positive control for OPN in each batch of immunostains for
quality control purposes.
Real-Time PCR Analysis. The mRNA expression of OPN was assessed by
real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from liver samples using TRIzol
reagent (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY). One g of total RNA was reverse￾transcribed using 50 U of SuperScript II RNaseH- reverse transcriptase and 50
ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was
performed using 4 L of the total cDNA in a 50 L reaction volume
containing QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
with the specific primers for human OPN and the housekeeping gene GAPDH
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The primer sequences used
are: OPN- forward 5'-GCC GAG GTG ATA GTG TGG TT- 3'; reverse 5'-
ATT CAA CTC CTC GCT TTC CAT- 3' and GAPDH-forward 5'-GTC GTG
GAT CTG ACG TGC C-3'; reverse 5'-TGC CTG CTT CAC CAC CTT C-3'.
Amplification was performed in duplicate for each sample in an ABI Prism
5700 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with
denaturation for 15 min at 95°C followed by 40 PCR cycles of denaturation at
94°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s. The
amount of mRNA was calculated using GAPDH as the endogenous control.
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Western Blotting.
OPN protein expression was assessed in liver samples by ELISA using a kit
procedure (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Some samples were also analyzed
by western blotting. Liver samples were homogenized in a lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P40, and 1 mM DTT) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Homogenates were
centrifuged at 12,000  g for 5 min at 4°C. Samples containing 300 g – 1 mg
protein were analyzed by ELISA as per kit instructions. Results are expressed
as ng OPN per g total protein.
For western blotting, liver homogenates were mixed with 5 reducing
electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 containing 10%
glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% -mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromophenol blue) and
heated for 5 min at 95°C. Samples containing 25 g protein were resolved by
10% SDS PAGE and then transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes
by electrophoresis. OPN protein was detected using a monoclonal anti-OPN
antibody MPIIIB10 (1:10 dilution) (Development Studies Hybridoma Bank,
University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) with overnight incubation at 4°C. The
bound primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, Amersham, Arlington
Heights, IL) and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence method.
Quantitation of protein levels was performed by densitometric analysis using
an Eagle Eye II video system (Strategene, La Jolla, CA).
Bile Duct Epithelial Cell Culture. An epithelial cell line derived from a
human gallbladder carcinoma was kindly provided by Greg Fitz, University of
Colorado, Denver. These cells exhibit a differentiated bile duct epithelial
phenotype and have been previously used in studies of bile duct injury (54).
Cultures were grown in CMRL-1060 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 200 mM glutamine. Cultures were maintained in 75 cm3
flasks in their growth medium in 5% CO2/95% air at 37°C. To assess the effect
of IL-2 and TNF- on OPN expression, cells were subcultured in 100 mm
dishes in growth medium until the cultures reached 70 – 80% confluence. At
this time cells were made quiescent by incubation for 24 h in serum-free
CMRL-1060 medium. Quiescent cultures were exposed to IL-2 (100 ng/mL) or
TNF- (100 ng/mL) for 18 h. At the end of the incubation, conditioned
medium was removed and analyzed for OPN protein expression by western
blotting and ELISA. Cells were harvested, RNA extracted as above and mRNA
expression measured by real time PCR.
Statistical Analysis. Comparison between groups was performed using t
test for unpaired samples. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Histology and OPN expression by immunohistochemistry:
Table 1 shows the portal histopathologic findings in the liver
samples examined. Both groups of “normal” children had
completely normal portal histology (Table 1 and Fig. 1A).
Acquired biliary atresia at the time of diagnosis was notable for
extensive portal fibrosis, moderate inflammation and severe
proliferation of biliary structures (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Syn￾dromic biliary atresia at the time of diagnosis also showed
extensive portal fibrosis and severe proliferation of biliary
structures (Fig. 1E and Table 1). Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis
demonstrated minimal or no portal fibrosis, mild to moderate
inflammation, and normal numbers of interlobular bile ducts
(Fig. 1G and Table 1). Samples obtained from infants with
biliary obstruction not due to biliary atresia had lower scores
than biliary atresia for fibrosis and inflammation and similarly
high scores for proliferation of biliary structures (Fig. 1I and
Table 1). Samples obtained from biliary atresia at the time of
transplant all showed biliary cirrhosis with expansive portal
fibrosis and minimal inflammation (Table 1). They were
clearly divided into two groups with regard to biliary findings.
One group comprising six samples exhibited proliferation of
biliary structures (Fig. 2A), while no biliary structures could be
identified in the remaining three samples (Fig. 2C). The sam￾ples from Alagille syndrome patients showed duct paucity,
whereas on average, portal fibrosis was mildly increased with￾out bridging, and portal inflammation was mild consisting
almost exclusively of histiocytes (Fig. 2E and Table 1).
Table 2 shows the OPN expression on immunohistochem￾istry of the various samples examined. Both groups of
“normal” children showed some expression of OPN in
hepatocytes, but none in interlobular bile ducts (Fig. 1B).
The expression of OPN and its tissue location were dis￾tinctly different in biliary atresia from other cholestatic
diseases examined. Biliary atresia at the time of diagnosis
showed marked OPN staining in portal areas predominantly
in biliary epithelium (Fig. 1D). Some OPN expression was
OSTEOPONTIN IN BILIARY ATRESIA 839

also observed in the inflammatory cells (Fig. 1D). In con￾trast, syndromic biliary atresia showed no OPN expression
in biliary epithelium (Fig. 1F), whereas there was apparent
increased expression in hepatocytes. Idiopathic neonatal
hepatitis typically demonstrated OPN staining in portal
inflammatory cells but not in interlobular bile ducts (Fig.
1H). Biopsies from infants with biliary obstruction not due
to biliary atresia showed no OPN staining in epithelium of
interlobular biliary structures (Figs. 1J), whereas inflamma￾tory cells in these samples showed positive staining.
OPN staining in samples obtained from biliary atresia at the
time of transplant fell into two groups, consonant with the
presence of proliferation of biliary structures or their absence.
In samples with biliary proliferation, marked OPN expression
was seen in biliary epithelium and in bile within the duct
structures (Fig. 2B), whereas samples with absent duct struc￾tures showed minimal OPN staining in portal areas, exclu￾sively in blood vessels (Fig. 2D). Samples from Alagille
syndrome showed minimal portal OPN staining (Fig. 2F).

840 WHITINGTON ET AL.

Blood vessels and hepatocytes stained, but histiocytic inflam￾matory infiltrates did not.
Extrahepatic bile ducts from a limited number of samples,
one infant deceased donor and two infants with biliary atresia,
were examined for OPN staining. Normal infant extrahepatic
bile duct showed OPN staining localized to bile duct epithe￾lium (Fig. 2G). These findings suggest a differential location of
normal constitutive OPN expression to larger bile ducts (see
Fig. 1B for comparison). Biliary atresia samples showed a
similar degree of OPN expression in intact biliary epithelium
and significant staining within the fibrous matrix surrounding
the bile duct (Fig. 2H).
OPN mRNA and protein expression. The quantitative ex￾pression of OPN mRNA and protein in liver did not differ
between the two groups of “normal” children and are combined
in these analyses. It should be noted that we only had formalin￾fixed tissue from the 5-wk old deceased donor, which could not
be included in this analysis. Figure 3A shows the expression of
OPN mRNA in tissue samples from biliary atresia and Alagille
syndrome relative to normal liver. OPN mRNA was increased
4 –5-fold over normal in biliary atresia at the time of diagnosis.
This was further increased to 10 – 11-fold over normal in
samples from biliary atresia at the time of transplantation in
which biliary proliferation was evident. In contrast, samples
from biliary atresia at the time of transplantation in which duct
structures were absent and samples from Alagille syndrome, all
of which had paucity of ducts and no ductular proliferation,
showed OPN mRNA expression that was not different from
normal.
Figure 3B shows the expression of OPN protein as measured
by ELISA in tissue samples from biliary atresia and Alagille
syndrome relative to a normal liver. OPN protein concentration
in the normal liver samples was 11  3 ng/g total protein.
There was inadequate tissue in the limited samples available
for biliary atresia at diagnosis to perform this analysis. Expres￾sion in samples from biliary atresia at the time of transplanta￾tion in which biliary proliferation was evident was increased to
54  5 ng/g total protein. Samples from biliary atresia with
absent duct structures and samples from Alagille syndrome
showed much lower OPN protein concentrations, 23  2 and
20  4 ng/g total protein, respectively. Figure 4 shows a
western blot of OPN protein in biliary atresia at the time of
transplantation. Marked increases in 66 kD OPN and smaller
isoforms (40 kD, 32 kD and 20 kD) were observed in samples
in which there was biliary proliferation when compared with
their expression in normal liver. In contrast, OPN expression
was only slightly increased in biliary atresia samples with
absent bile duct structures compared with normal liver.

of the six samples in which histology showed ongoing extensive biliary
proliferation (histology of BA 1 shown in Fig. 2A). It shows marked increased
expression of the secretory forms of OPN, from 66 kD extending down to 20
kD. This sample and the normal liver also show the 78 kD constitutive OPN.
The sample in lane 3 (BA 2) is representative of the three samples in which
ducts could not be identified by histology (histology of BA 2 shown in Fig.

expression of constitutive OPN.

culture showed considerable constitutive levels of OPN mRNA
(Fig. 5A) and protein expression (Fig. 5B) as assessed by
real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Treatment of
cells with TNF- significantly reduced both the mRNA and
protein expression of OPN. Incubation with IL-2 resulted in
increased expression of OPN protein, whereas the OPN mRNA
levels remained unchanged.
DISCUSSION
The aim of the present study was to carefully examine the
expression of OPN in biliary atresia. The over-expression of
OPN mRNA in biliary atresia relative to other pediatric cho￾lestatic diseases has been reported (52). However, the cell type
contributing to that over-expression has not been examined,
and the specificity of OPN expression for biliary atresia has not
been determined. The focus of the current study was to deter￾mine whether OPN contributes to the unique pathophysiology
of biliary atresia. Our cell culture studies show that OPN is
synthesized by bile duct epithelium. Synthesis and secretion
can be modulated by IL-2 and TNF-, Th1 cytokines that have
also been implicated in biliary atresia (14). We demonstrated
expression of OPN in biliary epithelium of normal infant
extrahepatic bile duct, but not in normal interlobular bile duct
epithelium. We also demonstrated that OPN is greatly over￾expressed in proliferating interlobular biliary structures and
bile retained within them in biliary atresia. In contrast, inter￾lobular biliary structures in syndromic biliary atresia and bili￾ary obstruction not due to biliary atresia showed no such OPN
expression. The findings in biliary atresia suggest a change in
OPN expression by interlobular bile duct structures potentially
resulting from a specific biliary injury.
Biliary atresia is accompanied by aggressive and severe
portal fibrosis in most cases (4), as was demonstrated in the
samples we examined. Hepatic fibrosis is thought to be the
product of activated stellate cells in response to injury, and
portal fibrosis is thought to be the product other fibroblastic
cells infiltrating the portal areas, for which cytokine signaling
is necessary (55,56). OPN has been shown to be critical in the
development of fibrosis in models of renal tubulo-interstitial
disease (20,24,57,58). In these studies, OPN-knockout mice
were shown to have marked reductions in collagen synthesis
and deposition relative to wild type mice exposed to the same
experimental injury. Our recent studies involving a dietary
murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis demonstrate an
important role for hepatocyte derived OPN in the development
of hepatic fibrosis (48). OPN-null mice showed much less
collagen I mRNA expression and minimal hepatic fibrosis
compared with wild type littermates exposed to the same
experimental conditions (48). In the current study, we showed
that OPN mRNA is substantially over-expressed in whole liver
samples from biliary atresia obtained at the time of diagnosis,
which is consistent with published findings (52). OPN protein
is located mainly in the epithelium of proliferating biliary
structures by immunohistochemistry suggesting that biliary
epithelium is the source of much of the OPN over-expressed in
whole liver at this time. It has been shown that recombinant
OPN can act as a cytokine for Kupffer cell migration and
macrophage activation (17,44). In turn, local accumulation of
Kupffer cells and macrophages is considered to be important in
the cascade of stellate cell activation and fibrosis in hepato￾biliary disease (59,60). This suggests that bile duct derived
OPN could play a role in the progression of biliary atresia.
Biliary atresia is also noted for extensive proliferation of
interlobular biliary epithelium. OPN has been shown to exert a
mitogenic effect on renal tubular epithelial cells (27) and is
strongly anti-apoptotic in several tissues (61,62). In contrast,
TNF- has been shown to be pro-apoptotic to bile duct epi￾thelial cells (63). It is possible that OPN synthesized by biliary
epithelium in biliary atresia is acting in an autocrine fashion to
maintain proliferation and/or reduce apoptosis in opposition to
TNF- produced by local inflammation. Consistent with this
notion, OPN has been shown to mediate the proliferation of
cultured mesangial and vascular smooth muscle cells
(23,24,27). There is reasonable evidence to suggest that OPN
and TNF- may have somewhat oppositional effects in the Th1
inflammatory process. We demonstrated that TNF- has an
inhibitory effect on bile duct epithelial cell expression of OPN,
and yet OPN induces macrophages to produce TNF- (64).
The loss of interlobular bile duct structures in some cases of
biliary atresia may represent an imbalance of cytokine signals.
The stimulus for increased expression of OPN by proximal
bile duct epithelium in biliary atresia could be a primary injury
or the result of distal obstruction. It is of interest that prolifer￾ating interlobular bile ducts in cases of biliary obstruction not
due to biliary atresia do not express OPN. Moreover, prolifer￾ating interlobular biliary epithelium in syndromic biliary atre￾sia does not stain for OPN. This finding is consistent with a
recent gene expression analysis that failed to show over￾expression of OPN in syndromic biliary atresia (65). These
findings suggest that the pathogenesis of interlobular biliary
proliferation in distal obstruction, including that due to
syndromic biliary atresia, may involve different signaling
mechanisms.
Cholestasis itself might be a stimulus for increased hepatic
expression of OPN. To address this question, we compared the
Figure 5. (A,B) Effect of IL-2 and TNF- on OPN expression in cultured bile
duct epithelial cells. Quiescent cells were exposed in a serum-free medium
either to IL-2 or TNF- at concentrations of 100 ng/mL for 18 h. At the end
of respective incubations, mRNA expression was determined in cells (panel
A), and conditioned medium was analyzed for OPN protein expression by
western blotting (panel B). TNF- inhibited both OPN mRNA and protein
expression, whereas IL-2 increased OPN protein expression but had no effect
on mRNA levels. Each value is mean  SE of 5 separate determinations.

expression of OPN in cases of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis,
which were relatively age-matched for biliary atresia at diag￾nosis, and Alagille syndrome, which were similar in age to
biliary atresia at transplantation. Immunohistochemistry dem￾onstrated no expression of OPN in interlobular bile ducts in
cases of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. The whole liver samples
from Alagille syndrome showed no increase in OPN mRNA,
whereas OPN protein expression was increased above normal.
This correlated with increased hepatocyte OPN staining, which
is consistent with posttranscriptional regulation of hepatocyte
OPN synthesis as we have previously demonstrated (48).
Samples of biliary atresia obtained at transplantation that had
extreme duct paucity showed similar OPN protein expression
to Alagille syndrome, about 2-fold greater than normal. In
contrast to Alagille syndrome, we could not demonstrate in￾creased hepatocyte OPN immunostaining in these samples.
However, they did contain increased numbers of arteries that
stained for OPN (Fig. 2D) and expansive fibrosis that could
diffusely contain OPN protein, which could not be demon￾strated by immunostains. Focal accumulation of OPN was
demonstrated in the fibrous matrix of the hilar remnant in
biliary atresia (Fig. 2H), which shows that this secretory
protein can be sequestered in areas of fibrosis. Taken together,
these findings suggest that cholestasis itself does not lead to
OPN over-expression by bile ducts in pediatric liver disease,
but may lead to increased expression by other elements of the
liver.
In summary, our data show that hepatic OPN expression is
markedly increased in biliary atresia relative to other pediatric
cholestatic diseases. OPN appears to be localized predomi￾nantly in interlobular biliary epithelium and bile within duct
structures. Its increased expression in biliary atresia coincides
with proliferation of biliary structures and fibrosis. Together,
these findings suggest that OPN may participate in the Th1
signaling involved in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia.
