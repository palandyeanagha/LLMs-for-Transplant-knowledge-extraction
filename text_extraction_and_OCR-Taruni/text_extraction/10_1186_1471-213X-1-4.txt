Abstract
Background: Several Cre reporter strains of mice have been described, in which a lacZ gene is
turned on in cells expressing Cre recombinase, as well as their daughter cells, following Cre￾mediated excision of a loxP-flanked transcriptional "stop" sequence. These mice are useful for cell
lineage tracing experiments as well as for monitoring the expression of Cre transgenes. The green
fluorescent protein (GFP) and variants such as EYFP and ECFP offer an advantage over lacZ as a
reporter, in that they can be easily visualized without recourse to the vital substrates required to
visualize β-gal in living tissue.
Results: In view of the general utility of targeting the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus, we
constructed a generic ROSA26 targeting vector. We then generated two reporter lines of mice by
inserting EYFP or ECFP cDNAs into the ROSA26 locus, preceded by a loxP-flanked stop sequence.
These strains were tested by crossing them with transgenic strains expressing Cre in a ubiquitous
(β-actin-Cre) or a cell-specific (Isl1-Cre and En1-Cre) pattern. The resulting EYFP or ECFP expression
patterns indicated that the reporter strains function as faithful monitors of Cre activity.
Conclusions: In contrast to existing lacZ reporter lines, where lacZ expression cannot easily be
detected in living tissue, the EYFP and ECFP reporter strains are useful for monitoring the
expression of Cre and tracing the lineage of these cells and their descendants in cultured embryos
or organs. The non-overlapping emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP make them ideal for double
labeling studies in living tissues.
Background
The Cre-loxP site specific recombination system [1] is
widely used for production of tissue-specific and condi￾tional knockout alleles in mice [2,3]. Recently, a Cre-de￾pendent lacZ reporter strain (R26R) was produced by
targeted insertion of a lacZ gene, preceded by a loxP￾flanked (floxed) strong transcriptional termination se￾quence (tpA), into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26
locus [4, 5]. The R26R allele terminates transcription
prematurely, but when the mice are crossed with Cre-ex￾Published: 27 March 2001

pressing transgenic mice, the Cre-mediated excision of
the floxed termination sequence leads to constitutive
lacZ expression. Thus, these doubly transgenic animals
express lacZ only in the cells that have expressed Cre, as
well as in all of their daughter cells. Similar Cre reporter
strains have been produced using different promoters to
express lacZ [6–9], Another variation on this theme has
been the development of the Z/AP reporter strain, which
switches from lacZ to alkaline phosphatase expression
upon exposure to Cre recombinase activity [10]. All of
these strains are useful for monitoring the expression of
Cre recombinase, as well as for cell lineage tagging exper￾iments [9, 11–14].
Here, we describe the production of two similar Cre re￾porter alleles that express enhanced yellow or cyan fluo￾rescent protein (EYFP or ECFP), two color variants of the
green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP and its variants are
autofluorescent proteins that can be visualized in living
cells, and are therefore particularly useful for monitoring
gene expression in whole embryos, animals or cultured
cells and organs [15]. EYFP and ECFP were chosen be￾cause their emission spectra overlap minimally, so they
can be distinguished when used simultaneously, whereas
the emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP overlap to a
greater extent with that of EGFP [16, 17] http://
www.clontech.com/gfp/pdf/LivingColors.pdf.
During the course of this work, three new Cre reporter
strains that conditionally express EGFP were reported.
Two transgenic strains [18, 19] use the β-actin promoter/
CMV enhancer to express EGFP following Cre-mediated
excision of a stop sequence, and in one of these, lacZ is
expressed prior to the Cre-mediated excision event. In
the third strain, which is similar in principle to the YFP
and CFP alleles reported here, EGFP was inserted at the
ROSA26 locus [20]. The availability of different Cre re￾porter strains will be valuable, not only because of the
advantages of different reporter proteins, but also be￾cause the efficiency of Cre-mediated excision may be de￾pendent on the target locus.
Results and Discussion
Considering the utility of the ROSA26 locus for express￾ing various sequences in a ubiquitous manner [4, 5, 21],
we generated a generic targeting vector (pBigT), into
which any sequence of interest can easily be inserted
downstream of a floxed neo-tpA cassette, and then sub￾sequently cloned into a plasmid with the ROSA26 ge￾nomic flanking arms. ECFP or EYFP was inserted into
pBigT, and the resulting sequence was inserted into a
vector containing ROSA26 genomic sequences to permit
homologous recombination (Fig 1A). The targeting vec￾tor was electroporated into ES cells, and 27 G418-resist￾ant colonies were analyzed for each construct. Three
R26R-EYFP and two R26R-ECFP colonies carried the
targeted allele, as determined by Southern blot hybridi￾zation (Figure 1B). The targeted ES cells, originally de￾rived from strain 129X1/SvJ [22], were injected into
C57BL/6J blastocysts, and the resulting chimeric mice
were bred to C57BL/6J females to pass the mutation
through the germ line. Thus, the resulting mice were a
mixture of strains 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J.
No background expression of EYFP or ECFP could be de￾tected in the R26R-EYFP or R26R-ECFP mice, as expect￾ed (data not shown), due to the strong transcriptional
stop sequence inserted between the promoter and the
coding sequences. However, when the reporter mice
were crossed to β-actin-Cre transgenic mice [23], which
express Cre constitutively in most or all cells including
those in the early embryo, the resulting doubly transgen￾ic embryos displayed apparently ubiquitous expression
of EYFP or ECFP (Figure 2), indicating efficient excision
of the floxed stop sequence. The expression of EYFP vs.
ECFP could be clearly distinguished using appropriate
filter sets (Fig 2). This ubiquitous expression of EYFP or
ECFP was heritably transmitted to the following genera￾tions (data not shown), resulting in ubiquitously ex￾pressing lines of mice that will be useful for lineage
tracing in chimeric mice or embryos, analogous to the
original ROSA26 lacZ promoter trap strain [21].
The specificity of the R26R-EYFP and ECFP lines was
tested by crossing them with strains of mice that express
Cre in a tissue-specific fashion. Isl1 is a LIM homeodo￾main transcription factor expressed in motor neurons
and dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia [24]. Isl1-Cre
mice were produced by targeting Cre into the Isl1 locus
(see Materials and Methods). Heterozygous Isl1-Cre
mice were viable and fertile, while homozygous mice
died at E9-E10.5, as has been previously described with
mice in which the exon encoding the second LIM domain
of Isl1 had been deleted [25]. Figure 3A shows an exper￾iment in which the R26R-YFP mice were crossed with
the Isl1-Cre mice, resulting in expression of EYFP in mo￾tor neurons and dorsal root ganglia in the doubly trans￾genic offspring. Thus R26R-YFP mice faithfully report
the cell-specific patterns of Isl1/Cre in subsets of neu￾rons. As a control, the Isl-1/Cre mice were also mated to
the original R26R lacZ allele [4], resulting in a similar
pattern of expression of lacZ.
Engrailed-1 (En-1) is a homeodomain protein expressed
specifically at the mid-hindbrain junction of the early
somite stage embryo, as well as in a number of sites later
in embryogenesis. Figure 4 shows an experiment in
which R26R-YFP mice were crossed with a strain of mice
in which Cre was knocked into the En-1 locus [26], re￾sulting in the expression of YFP specifically at the mid-

BMC Developmental Biology (2001) 1:4 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/1/4
hindbrain junction in an E8.5 embryo. For comparison,
we also crossed the En-1/Cre mice with the original
R26R lacZ allele [4], resulting in lacZ expression in the
same region at E8.5 (Fig 4C).
The expression of ECFP proved more difficult to detect in
fixed and sectioned tissue (data not shown), although it
was clearly detectable in unfixed embryonic tissue (Fig
2C). This is not surprising, given the higher quantum
yield and extinction coefficient of EYFP as compared to

Conclusions
We have constructed two reporter lines of mice that ex￾press EYFP or ECFP only in cells expressing the Cre re￾combinase, and their daughter cells, by targeting these
cDNAs into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus,
preceded by a loxP flanked "stop" sequence. Crosses with
a general Cre expressing strain (βactin-Cre) and two tis￾sue-specific Cre strains (Isl1-Cre and En1-Cre) showed
that the reporter strains function as expected, based on
their similarity to the well characterized R26R-lacZ
strains. In contrast to lacZ expression, which cannot be
easily detected in living tissue, the EYFP and ECFP re￾porter strains (together with the GFP reporter strains
currently available) will be very useful for monitoring the
expression of Cre in living tissues, or tracing the lineage
of these cells and their descendants, in cultured embryos
or organs. Furthermore, by using modified forms of Cre
whose recombinase activity is inducible, one can use
these reporter mice to perform detailed analysis on the
lineage of cells at different time points during develop￾ment.
Materials and Methods
Sources of Plasmids
The components of the ROSA26 targeting vectors were a
gift from Philippe Soriano. The adenovirus splice accep￾tor (SA) and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation se￾quence (bpA) were from plasmid pSAβgeo [21]. The loxP
flanked neo cassette, and trimer of the SV40 polyade￾nylation sequence (tpA), were from plasmid
PGKneotpAlox2 [4]. The ROSA26 genomic sequence and
the diphtheria toxin (DTA) expression cassette were
from plasmid pROSA26-1 [4], and the template for the
external probe used to genotype ES cells was from plas￾mid pROSA26-5' [4].
The plasmids pEYFP-N1 and pECFP containing cDNA
for EYFP and ECFP were purchased from Clontech Lab￾oratories Inc.
Targeting Constructs
The plasmid pBigT consists of the adenovirus splice ac￾ceptor sequence followed by a loxP site, neo expression
cassette, strong transcriptional stop sequence (triple
SV40 polyadenylation sequence), another loxP site in the
same orientation as the first, a multiple cloning site
(MCS), and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation
sequence. A PacI site was included 5' to the SA, and an
AscI site 3' to the bpA. These two enzymes are rare eight
base pair cutters and result in sticky ends upon digestion
and can be used to excise the entire construct, for inser￾tion into the plasmid with the ROSA26 genomic arms.

The XbaI site used for insertion into the ROSA26 genom￾ic locus [4] was replaced by a linker (PacI, SwaI, AscI), so
that it could be digested with PacI and AscI, and receive
the bigT sequence.
To make pBigT, plasmid pSAβgeo was digested with ClaI
and XbaI to remove the βgeo and bpA sequence but leave
behind the SA, the ends were Klenow filled and the plas￾mid self-ligated. The resulting plasmid was digested with
SacI and PstI to remove the 5' MCS, which was replaced
by a PacI linker. The resulting plasmid was called pPac￾SA.
Next, pSAβgeo was digested with SacI to remove the SA
and βgeo sequences, but leave behind the bpA, and self￾ligated. The resulting plasmid was digested with XbaI
and ApaI to remove most of the 3' MCS (except for the
terminal KpnI site), which was replaced with an AscI
linker. The resulting plasmid was called pbpAAsc.
The loxP-neo-tpA-loxP was excised from plasmid
PGKneotpAlox2 by cutting with NotI, Klenow filling, and
then cutting with KpnI. This was inserted downstream of
the SA in pPacSA digested with SalI, Klenow filled, and
then cut with KpnI. A MCS containing the restriction
sites for XhoI, ApaI, SacII, NotI, SacI, EcoRV, and KpnI
was synthesized and inserted downstream of the second
loxP site by digesting the DNA with XhoI and KpnI and
ligating in the MCS, which had been synthesized to have
compatible cohesive ends. This plasmid was called
pSAleotpA. The bpA sequence along with the 3' AscI site
was excised from pbpAAsc by digesting it with SacI and
KpnI, and inserted downstream of the MCS in pSAleotpA
by digesting it with SacI and KpnI. The resulting plasmid
was called pBigT, and its MCS contains sites for the re￾striction enzymes NheI, SalI, AccI, XhoI, ApaI, SacII,
NotI, SacI and BclI.
To make the ROSA26 genomic sequence compatible with
the pBigT plasmid, pROSA26-1 was digested with XbaI,
Klenow filled and a linker (PacI, SwaI, AscI) inserted.
This plasmid was called pROSA26PA.
To make the R26R-YFP targeting construct, the EYFP
cDNA was excised from pEYFP-N1 with ApaI and NotI
and inserted into BigT digested with ApaI and NotI. BigT
was then digested with PacI and AscI to release the entire
floxed neo-tpA and EYFP assembly, and inserted into
pROSA26PA digested with PacI and AscI. This plasmid
was subsequently linearized with KpnI and used for elec￾troporation.
To make the R26R-CFP targeting construct pECFP was
digested with AgeI, Klenow filled then digested with NotI
to excise the ECFP cDNA. This was inserted into BigT di￾gested with XhoI, Klenow filled, and then digested with
NotI. BigT was then digested with PacI and AscI to re￾lease the entire floxed neo-tpA and CFP assembly, and
inserted into pROSA26PA digested with PacI and AscI.
This plasmid was subsequently linearized with KpnI and
used for electroporation.
An appreciable amount of recombination was observed
while trying to grow up the final targeting vector, result￾ing in an aberrant plasmid of smaller molecular weight.
Therefore, the mixture of theses two plasmids was di￾gested with KpnI which linearized both plasmids, and
the correct targeting vector was gel purified. It was sub￾sequently confirmed to be the correct targeting vector by
diagnostic PCR, restriction digests and sequencing (data
not shown).
Targeting of the ROSA26 locus in ES cells
JM-1 ES cells [22] were expanded by culturing on feeder
cells in medium supplemented with LIF. Approximately
15 × 106 cells were electroporated with 10 µg of each tar￾geting vector and grown without feeders under selection
in 300 µg/ml G418 for seven days. 96 colonies were
picked and 27 screened, for electroporations with each of
the two constructs R26R-YFP and R26R-CFP. Genomic
Southern blot hybridization was performed on DNA
from ES cells digested with EcoRV. The 5' probe used de￾tects a 11 kb wild type band and a 3.8 kb targeted band,
due to the presence of an extra EcoRV site in the targeted
allele.
Mice carrying the targeted allele were genotyped by the
PCR as described [4].
Construction of the Isl1-Cre mouse strain.
Isl1 genomic DNA had been previously isolated from a
mouse 129/Sv genomic library (Stratagene) as described
by Pfaff et al. [25]. A PacI site had been introduced into
an EcoRI site in the exon encoding the second LIM do￾main of Isl1. A cassette coating IRES Cre SV40 pA and
pgk-neomycin was cloned into this PacI site to create a
targeting construct with flanking 5' and 3' genomic DNA
arms of 5 kb and 2 kb, respectively. ES cells were targeted
and screened as described in Pfaff et al.[25].
Mouse strains
En-1/Cre mice (En1Cki allele) were a gift of Dr. Alexan￾dra Joyner and Dr. Wolfgang Wurst [26]. β-actin/Cre
mice were a gift of Dr. Gail Martin [23]. R26R-lacZ re￾porter mice were a gift of Dr. Philippe Soriano [4].
Detecting EYFP and ECFP expression.
For whole mount photographs (Figures 2 and 4), unfixed
embryos were photographed using a Nikon epifluores￾cence microscope fitted with Chroma filter sets for ECFP

BMC Developmental Biology (2001) 1:4 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/1/4
(cyan GFP Ex436/20 Dm455 Bar480/40) and EYFP
(yellow GFP Ex500/20 Dm515 Bar535/30). Digital im￾ages were acquired using a Spot camera.
For histological sections (Fig 3), embryos were fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, washed 2x for
10 min. in PBS, then equilibrated in the following solu￾tions until the embryos settled at the bottom (approx. 30
min): PBS, 5% sucrose in PBS, 10% sucrose in PBS, and
15% sucrose in PBS. They were then equilibrated in a 1:1
mixture of OCT (Tissue-Tek, Mile, Inc.) and 15% sucrose
in PBS for >1 hour, and embedded in OCT over dry ice.
Sections were cut at 8 - 12 µM, blow-dried for 30 min. at
low heat, then stored at -80°C with desiccant in an air
tight bag. Before being photographed, the slides were
brought to room temperature, washed 3x in PBS, mount￾ed in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), covered with a
cover glass and sealed with clear nail polish. Sections
were photographed as described above.
