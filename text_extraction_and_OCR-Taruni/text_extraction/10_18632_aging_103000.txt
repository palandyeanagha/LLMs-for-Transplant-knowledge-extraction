INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) is a viral 
respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel 
coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has caused the 
pneumonia epidemic in the world [1–3]. As of March 
5, 2020, a total of 96539 cases with laboratory￾confirmed COVID-19 infection have been detected in 
the world reported by the World Health Organization 
(WHO). In China, there have been 80567 accumulated 
confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 5952 of them 
were existing severe patients. Given the rapid spread 
and high mortality rate of COVID-19, it is absolutely 
necessary to evaluate the possible risk factors 
affecting the progression of disease in COVID-19 
patients. 
Previous studies show that COVID-19 patients with 
comorbidity may lead to a poor prognosis [5].
Identifying the most important risk groups is essential 
when making decisions anti-2019-nCoV therapy. To 
date, there has been no systematic review that 
comprehensively explores whether the presence of 
common comorbidities increase COVID-19 patients’ 
risk, to guide clinical practice better. Therefore, we 
performed a meta-analysis of the available studies to 
explore relationship between comorbidity and patients 
with COVID-19.

ABSTRACT
Currently, the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased rapidly, but
relationship between comorbidity and patients with COVID-19 still not clear. The aim was to explore whether
the presence of common comorbidities increases COVID-19 patients’ risk. A literature search was performed
using the electronic platforms (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases) to obtain relevant
research studies published up to March 1, 2020. Relevant data of research endpoints in each study were
extracted and merged. All data analysis was performed using Stata12.0 software. A total of 1558 patients
with COVID-19 in 6 studies were enrolled in our meta-analysis eventually. Hypertension (OR: 2.29, P<0.001),
diabetes (OR: 2.47, P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR: 5.97, P<0.001),
cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.93, P<0.001), and cerebrovascular disease (OR:3.89,P=0.002) were independent
risk factors associated with COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis revealed no correlation between increased
risk of COVID-19 and liver disease, malignancy, or renal disease. Hypertension, diabetes, COPD,
cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19.
Knowledge of these risk factors can be a resource for clinicians in the early appropriate medical management
of patients with COVID-19.

RESULTS 
Literature search and screening 
The database searches identified a total of 324 
potentially relevant articles. After the exclusion of 
duplicate references,243 articles were considered for the 
meta-analysis. Of these,208 studies were excluded after 
screening the title and abstract. After careful review of 
the full texts, 29 articles were excluded because they 
were reviews, cases, and insufficient data. Six studies 
qualified for inclusion [1, 4–8]. The flow diagram 
(Figure 1) showed the detailed literature search steps.
Characteristics and quality of studies 
A total of 1558 samples from 6 retrospective studies 
were enrolled in this meta-analysis [1, 4–8]. All six 
studies were performed in China. Six studies [1, 4–8] 
reported that hypertension, diabetes, and COPD, five 
covered liver disease [1, 4–7], four investigated 
malignancy [1, 4, 5, 8], renal disease [4–7], and 
cardiovascular disease [4–7], and three [4, 5, 7] 
researched cerebrovascular disease. Two studies [1, 5] 
used whether patients experienced ICU care to judge the 
severity of the disease, and the other four studies used 
clinical symptoms to judge the severity of the disease. 
All articles are of high quality because of NOS score no 
less than 6. Detailed descriptions of the studies included 
are shown in Table 1.
Hypertension, diabetes, and COPD
Six studies, including 324 severe group cases and 1234 
non-severe group cases, provided the data in terms of 
hypertension, diabetes, and COPD [1, 4–8]. The

heterogeneity test showed low heterogeneity among 
these studies, and a fixed-effects model was used for the 
meta-analysis. The results find that COVID-19 patients 
with hypertension (OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.69-
3.10,P<0.001) (Figure 2A), diabetes (OR: 2.47, 95% CI: 
1.67-3.66, P<0.001) (Figure 2B), or COPD (OR: 5.97, 
95% CI: 2.49-14.29, P<0.001) (Figure 2C) had a higher 
risk of exacerbation.
Cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease
Four included studies reported the relationship between 
cardiovascular disease and patients with severe COVID￾19 [1, 4–6]. No significant heterogeneity was found (I2
=0, P=0.989) among these trials, so a fixed effect 
pattern was selected. The results showed that 
cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for patients with 
COVID-19 (OR:2.93, 95% CI: 1.73-4.96, P<0.001) 
(Figure 2G).
Three studies provided the data in terms of 
cerebrovascular disease [4, 5, 7]. A fixed-effects 
model was used since the heterogeneity test suggested 
that there was no significant heterogeneity (I2=44.8%, 
P=0.163). The meta-analysis shows a significant 
relationship between patients with severe COVID-19 
and cerebrovascular disease (OR:3.89, 95% CI: 1.64-
9.22, P=0.002) (Figure 2H).
Liver disease, malignancy, and renal disease
Five studies comprising 313 severe group cases and 
1167 non-severe group cases evaluated the role of 
liver disease in patients with COVID-19 [1, 4–7]. The 
meta-analysis showed that patients with the previous 
liver disease did not increase the risk of disease 
progression (OR:0.67, 95% CI: 0.30-1.49, P=0.326) 
(Figure 2D). 
The relative risk assessments associated with 
malignancy and kidney disease are presented in Figure 
2E and 2F, respectively. The meta-analysis suggested 
that there was no correlation between malignant tumor
(the 95% confidence interval includes 1) or kidney 
disease (P=0.070) and COVID-19 patients' 
aggravation.
Subgroup analysis
To further verify the correlation of comorbidity and 
COVID-19 patients' aggravation, subgroup analysis was 
conducted. The results of the subgroup analysis are 
presented in Table 2. The Subgroup analysis results 
further support the results of hypertension, COPD, liver 
disease, and renal disease. In the clinical symptom 
group, we further observed that hypertension, diabetes, 
COPD, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease were a 
risk factor in COVID-19 patients.
Publication bias 
The risk of publication bias was analyzed in the 
following comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes, COPD, 
and liver disease. Figure 3 shows the results of 
publication bias, which were evaluated by funnel plots
and Eggers test. Begg’s test (All Pr>0.05) and Egger’s 
regression test (All P >0.05) suggest no significant 
publication bias.
DISCUSSION 
Currently, the increasing number of cases and extensive 
geographical expansion of the COVID-19 are causing 
widespread concern in the world [9]. Tian et al [10].

and 73%. Until now, the source and pathogenesis of the 
COVID-19 remain unclear, and no specific treatment 
has been recommended for coronavirus infection except 
for meticulous supportive care [8, 11]. Unfortunately, in 
severe patients with COVID-19, the disease progresses 
rapidly, and respiratory failure can occur within a short 
time, even leading to death. Early data from Wuhan 
Jinyintan Hospital showed that 61.1% of patients in 
ICU had respiratory failure, 44.4% had arrhythmia, and 
30.6% had a shock [11]. Therefore, early identification 
of severe patients is of great significance for improving 
the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 and reducing 
mortality.
Previous studies have described that the presence of 
common comorbidities increase COVID-19 patients’ 
risk [5]. Besides, some scholars think that 
the presence of any coexisting illness was more 
common among patients with severe disease than 
among those with the non-severe disease [4]. 
However, the specific comorbidity by which can lead 
to disease progression remain unknown in COVID-19 
patients.
A total of 1558 COVID-19 patients were included in 
the analyses, 324 (20.8%) of whom were severe. The 
meta-analysis of retrospective studies confirms that 
COPD is associated with a dramatically increased risk 
of aggravation in patients with COVID-19. COVID￾19 patients with COPD had a 5.9-fold higher risk of 
progression than patients without COPD. Moreover, 
we identify an increased risk of aggravation in 

www.aging-us.com 6055 AGING
individuals who have hypertension, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease. 
Our meta-analysis did not provide sufficient evidence 
that there was a correlation between liver disease, 
malignant tumor or kidney disease, and COVID-19 
patients' aggravation.
However, this conclusion needs to be taken with 
caution, as this study has several limitations. Firstly, the 
small sample size may reduce the significance of the 
results. Secondly, the judgment criteria for severe and 
non-severe patients included in the study were not 
uniform. Thirdly, some included patients who had more

than one coexisting illness. Fourth, the quality of 
different studies was different, which might lead to bias.
CONCLUSIONS 
The meta-analysis identified hypertension, diabetes, 
COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular 
disease as significant risk factors for COVID-19 
patients. The knowledge of these factors can better 
define those COVID-19 patients at higher risk, and thus 
allow a more targeted and specific approach to prevent 
those deaths. Given the limitations of this conclusion, 
well-designed trials of high quality are needed to 
explore the relationship between comorbidity and 
patients with COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Search strategy and study selection
The Meta-analysis was performed according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement [12]. Relevant 
literature was extracted by systematic retrieval of 
PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, Springer, Web of 
Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to date to 
March 1, 2020. Our search strategy included terms for 
“2019-nCoV” or “Coronavirus” or “COVID-19” or 
“SARS-CoV-2” or “2019-nCoV” or “Wuhan 
Coronavirus.” Besides, we manually screened out the 
relevant potential article in the references selected. The 
above process was performed independently by two 
participants.
Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) Types of Studies: 
published studies reported the relationship between 
comorbidity and patients with COVID-19; (2) Subjects: 
diagnosed patients with COVID-19; (3) Exposure 
intervention: COVID-19 patients with comorbidity 
included: hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, malignancy, 
renal disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular 
disease; (4) Outcome indicator: the odds ratios (OR) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each 
comorbidity. 
The exclusion criteria: (1) Case reports, reviews, 
summaries of discussions, (2) Insufficient data 
information provided; (3) Patients were not stratified for 
the degree of severity.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two participants separately conducted literature 
screening, data extraction, and literature quality 
evaluation, and any differences could be resolved 
through discussion or a third analyst. Information 
extracted from the included literature: first author 
surname, year of publication, country of the population, 
sample size, relevant data on comorbidity of severe and 
non-severe patients, etc.
The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was adopted to 
evaluate the process in terms of queue selection, 
comparability of queues, and evaluation of results [13]. 
The quality of the included studies was assessed 
independently by two participants. NOS scores of at 
least six were considered high-quality literature. Higher 
NOS scores showed higher literature quality.
Statistical analysis
All data analysis was performed using Stata12.0 
software (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). The OR 
and relevant 95% CI were used to estimate pooled 
results from studies. After that, the heterogeneity test 
was conducted. When P≥0.05 or I2<50% was 
performed, it indicated that there was no obvious 
heterogeneity, and the fixed-effect model should be 
applied for a merger. Otherwise, the random-effect 
model was applied. Results were considered significant 
statistically when the p-value less than 0.05.
Studies were grouped according to the type of disease 
severity judgment basis. One subgroup is based on the 
clinical symptoms of patients, and the other subgroup is 
based on whether patients experience ICU care or not.
Subgroup sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
explore potential sources of heterogeneity.
Publication bias was assessed using Begg funnel plot 
and Egger test linear regression test (where at least five 
studies were available). If P < 0.05 indicates obvious 
publication bias.
