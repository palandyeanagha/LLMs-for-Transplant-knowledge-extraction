Purpose: We evaluated our experience with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in pa￾tients with multiple renal arteries, comparing operative outcomes and early graft func￾tion with patients with a single renal artery.
Materials and Methods: From January 2003 to February 2009, 130 patients underwent 
laparoscopic donor nephrectomy at our institution, 108 (83%) with a single renal artery 
and 22 (17%) with multiple arteries. Donor and recipient outcomes for single artery and 
multiple arteries allografts were compared.
Results: The LDN operative time was similar between the single artery and multiple 
arteries groups (162 vs 163 min, respectively, p = 0.87). Allografts with multiple arteries 
had significantly longer warm ischemia time (3.9 vs 4.9 min, p = 0.05) and cold isch￾emia time (72 vs 94 min, p < 0.001) than those with single artery. The conversion rate 
was similar between single and multiple arteries groups (6% vs 4.5%, respectively, p = 
0.7). Multiple arteries grafts had a non statistically significant higher rate of poor graft 
function when compared to single artery grafts (23% vs 12%, respectively, p = 0.18). 
Five patients in the single artery group (4.6%) and one patient in the multiple arter￾ies group (4.5%) needed dialysis during the first postoperative week. Overall, recipient 
complication rates were similar between single and multiple arteries groups (12.9% vs 
18.1%, respectively, p = 0.51).
Conclusion: Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with multiple arteries was associated with 
a non statistically significant higher rate of poor early graft function. The procedure 
appears to be safe in patients with multiple arteries, with similar complications rates. 
Multiple arteries should not be a contraindication for laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.
INTRODUCTION
Renal transplantation is the treatment of 
choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Unfortunately, donor organ shortage has become 
a problem preventing the wider application of this 
treatment (1). Since the first laparoscopic donor 
nephrectomy (LDN) performed by Ratner et al. in 
1995, the procedure has gained worldwide ac￾ceptance and popularity (2). The use of LDN may 
remove some of the disincentives of living donor 
transplantation, increasing the pool of kidneys 
available for transplantation with an increase of 
voluntary kidney donors (3). Some of the advan￾tages of the LDN include less donor morbidity, 
lower hospital stay, and better convalescence, 
with similar short and long term outcomes when 
compared to open surgery (4-8).
The presence of multiple renal arteries 
is considered the most common renal anatomic

variation. Autopsy studies showed that the prev￾alence of multiple renal arteries may vary from 
18 to 30%, and 15% of them being bilateral (9). 
Initially, multiple arteries were considered inap￾propriate for laparoscopic removal during kidney 
donation. With increasing experience, LDN has 
now been extended to donors with multiple renal 
arteries and extending this indication would be 
important to increase the pool of available kid￾neys for transplantation (1). However, the proce￾dure in patients with multiple renal arteries is still 
technically challenging, and concerns regarding 
prolonged operative times, ischemia time, and in￾creased risk of complications persists. In the pres￾ent study, we evaluated our experience with LDN 
in patients with multiple renal arteries, compar￾ing operative outcomes and early graft function 
with patients with a single renal artery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between January 2003 to February 2009, 
130 consecutive patients who underwent LDN at 
our institution were retrospectively reviewed. All 
donor patients underwent a preoperative evalua￾tion that consisted of history and physical exami￾nation, serum chemistry studies and imaging. The 
arterial anatomy was delineated by selective re￾nal angiography or computed tomography angio￾gram. All patients underwent transperitoneal LDN 
through a three or four-port approach. The renal 
artery and vein were secured with two Hem-o￾Lok™ (Weck Closure Systems™) clips on the aortic 
side and vena cava side, respectively. From 2003 
to 2005 all LDN were performed using a hand￾assisted device. After this period all procedures 
were performed by a pure laparoscopic approach, 
as previously described (10). Left kidney was pref￾erably procured due to its longer renal vein ex￾tent, unless an anatomical variation was observed 
during preoperative imaging.
Warm ischemia time was defined as the 
time from clamping until allograft perfusion with 
cold perfusate. The recipient procedure was per￾formed using the standard extraperitoneal ap￾proach. Single renal vein was first anastomosed 
to the external iliac vein. An end-to-side anasto￾mosis of the allograft renal artery with the recipi￾ent external iliac artery was usually preferred. In 
grafts with multiple renal arteries, bench end-to￾side accessory artery-to-main artery anastomosis 
or side-to-side conjoint artery-to-artery anas￾tomosis using 7-0 Prolene™ continuous sutures 
were performed.
We compared donor and recipient results 
for single artery (SA) and multiple arteries (MA) 
allografts. Donor parameters analyzed included 
age, gender, operative time, warm ischemia time, 
and estimated blood loss. Recipient parameters 
included age, gender, cold ischemia time, creati￾nine level at day 5, slow and delayed graft func￾tion rates, and early complications. Delayed graft 
function was defined as the need for hemodialysis 
on post-operative day 1-7. Slow graft function 
was defined as POD 5 serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg/
dL without need for hemodialysis on POD 1-7. 
An allograft was considered to have a poor ear￾ly graft function (EGF) if it experienced delayed 
graft function or slow graft function (11). Compli￾cations were classified as vascular (bleeding, he￾matoma, thrombosis, stenosis), ureteral (stricture, 
leak), and others (lymphocele, wound dehiscence, 
infection). Complications were graded using the 
Clavien-Dindo classification (12). Comparisons 
between categorical variables were performed us￾ing Chi-square tests and between continuous vari￾ables were performed using Mann-Whitney test. 
The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to test for 
the normality of the sample. Due to small number 
of events a multivariate analysis for predictors of 
poor graft function was not attempted. Statistical 
calculations were performed with Stata 8.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
In total, 108 allografts had SA (83%) 
and 22 had MA (17%). Donor and recipient de￾mographic characteristics are shown in Table-1. 
There was no statistically significant difference 
between SA and MA patients with regards to me￾dian donor age (39 vs 36 years, respectively, p = 
0.27), donor gender (40% vs 27% male donors, p 
= 0.27), recipient gender (58% vs 59% male re￾cipients, p = 0.95), LDN side (76% vs 68% left 
kidneys procured, p = 0.45), and LDN technique

slippery in two patients. One patient had a con￾version in the MA group due to a venous lesion 
during hilar dissection.
Recipient early outcomes
The early graft function is summarized in 
Table-2. Multiple arteries grafts had a non statis￾tically significant higher rate of poor graft func￾tion when compared to SA grafts (23% vs 12%, 
respectively, p = 0.18). Five patients in the SA 
group (4.6%) and one patient in the MA group 
(4.5%) needed dialysis during the first postopera￾tive week. The mean serum creatinine in the 5th 
postoperative day for the SA group was 1.86 mg/
dL and for the MA group was 2.49 mg/dL. This 
difference was not statistically significant (p = 
0.08). Overall, early recipient complication rates 
were similar between SA and MA groups (12.9% 
vs 18.1%, respectively, p = 0.51). The complica￾tions grade was also similar between both groups. 
Eleven patients (10.2%) in the SA group and three 
(46% vs 32% hand-assisted LDN, p = 0.21). Re￾cipients of allografts with MA were significantly 
older when compared with patients who received 
SA allografts (median age 47 vs 37 years, respec￾tively, p = 0.02).
Surgical events
Table-2 summarizes operative events for 
both groups. Briefly, the median LDN operative 
time was similar between the SA and MA groups 
(162 vs 163 min, respectively, p = 0.74). Al￾lografts with MA had significantly longer warm 
ischemic time (3.9 vs 4.9 min, p = 0.01) and cold 
ischemic time (72 vs 94 min, p < 0.001) than those 
with SA. The conversion rate was similar between 
SA and MA groups (6% vs 4.5%, respectively, p 
= 0.7). Overall, eight patients had an intraopera￾tive bleeding requiring open conversion to gain 
hemostasis. Seven of these patients had a single 
artery, and the reason for bleeding was a venous 
lesion during dissection in five patients and a clip

(13.6%) in the MA experienced major complica￾tions (grade III-V). One patient in the SA group 
with a renal vein thrombosis lost the allograft, 
and one patient on each group had sepsis and died 
after renal transplantation. Analyzing separately, 
the rate of vascular complications was similar be￾tween SA and MA groups (2.8% vs 4.5%, respec￾tively, p = 0.66) as well as the rate of ureteral com￾plications (5.6% vs 4.5%, respectively, p = 0.85).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared LDN per￾formed in kidneys with MA and kidneys with a

especially ureteral and vascular complications, 
were similar between both groups. We also found 
that patients who received allografts with MA had 
longer warm and cold ischemia times. These lon￾ger ischemia times translated into nearly a double 
of the rate of poor EGF for MA patients when 
compared to SA patients (23% vs 12%, respec￾tively). However, this difference was not statisti￾cally significantly and was not associated with a 
higher recipient need for dialysis during the first 
postoperative week.
In patients with MA, there is an increased 
risk of injury from more extensive dissection 
(13). The requirement for complicated vascular 
reconstruction and more difficult anastomosis at 
the time of implantation impose additional isch￾emic injury and subsequent reperfusion injury 
(13). This extended dissection and the need for 
back-table reconstruction have been shown, by 
some authors, to be associated with an increased 
risk for urological and vascular complications 
(9,14,15). Roza et al. analyzed 42 living donor 
open nephrectomies with multiple arteries and 
observed 8 patients (19%) with urological com￾plications and 3 (7%) with vascular complica￾tions (9). Carter et al. also showed a higher rate 
of ureteral complications in patients with mul￾tiple arteries (17% vs 3%) when analyzing 361 
LDN. The authors concluded that this higher rate 
could be a result of insufficient perfusion in the 
kidney’s lower pole, probably related to exces￾sive traction or cautery lesion during dissection 
(14). However, other papers analyzing LDN did 
not show a higher incidence of vascular and ure￾teral complications when harvesting kidneys with 
multiple arteries (16-18). In our study, the rate of 
vascular and ureteral complications was similar 
on both groups. At our institution, the ureteral 
dissection is performed carefully to maintain an 
adequate vascular supply to the lower pole and 
distal ureter. The back-table reconstruction and 
vascular anastomosis are meticulously performed 
by an experienced vascular surgeon to ensure an 
adequate lumen in the anastomosis in order to 
prevent thrombosis or technical errors.
Results from previous studies compar￾ing renal function outcomes in patients with MA 
and SA have been variable (13,16-20). Kuo et al.. 
showed similar functional outcomes for patients 
with one, two or three renal arteries. The authors 
analyzed 124 patients who underwent LDN, 83 
patients with a single artery, 33 with two arteries 
and 8 with three arteries, with 1-year graft sur￾vival rates of 96.1%, 90.9% and 90%, respectively 
(17). Similar results were published by other au￾thors (16,17,19). In the other hand, Paramesh et 
al. when analyzing 278 LDN during a 10-year pe￾riod, showed in a multivariable logistic regression 
analysis that MA was an independent risk factor 
for acute rejection. The authors also showed that 
the graft function at 6 and 12 months was signifi￾cantly lower in the MA group than SA group, and 
this trend persisted for 3 years after transplant 
(13). In the present study, the MA group had a 
higher rate of poor EGF when compared to the 
SA group (23% vs 12%, respectively). This dif￾ference was not statistically significant. However, 
we must acknowledge that this difference may 
be of clinical relevance since patients with MA 
had nearly a double of poor EGF. For this reason, 
at our institution, we usually procure the kidney 
with a single artery, regardless of the side, and 
perform a LDN in kidneys with multiple arteries 
only when both kidneys have this anomaly.
Warm and cold ischemia times have been 
shown to be associated with worst allograft out￾comes (11,21,22). Sasaki et al. analyzing 100 pa￾tients who underwent LDN showed that warm 
ischemia time longer than 10 minutes was associ￾ated with acute tubular necrosis and creatinine 
levels higher than 2 mg/dL in the 7th post-op￾erative day (22). Furthermore, the authors sug￾gest that the WIT should be less than 5 minutes 
to ensure the quality of renal transplantation. In 
our study, warm and cold ischemia times were the 
only variables analyzed that we found to be sta￾tistically different between MA and SA allografts. 
However, both groups had an acceptable total 
ischemia time. The other surgical factors ana￾lyzed, such as operative time and estimated blood 
loss, were similar, which is in accordance with 
previously published data (16,23).
The study has several limitations that de￾serve to be mentioned. First, this is a retrospec￾tive study with a small number of patients, espe￾cially in the MA group. If we had analyzed more 

ibju | laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with multiple renal arteries
501
patients the results could be different, especially 
renal function outcomes. Second, our study lacks 
information on long-term results and the renal 
function analysis was based only on early graft 
function. Although this is suboptimal, previous 
reports have shown that early function results 
are associated with worst long-term outcomes. 
For example, Nogueira et al., using the same poor 
EGF definition as ours, demonstrated that renal 
allograft survival is significantly worse in pa￾tients with poor early graft function, with more 
than double the risk for graft failure in these sub￾jects compared to those with adequate initial graft 
function (11). The authors also found inferior renal 
function at 1 year and worse rejection-free sur￾vival in this group. Third, we did not differentiate 
large renal arteries, such as polar arteries, from 
small branches that are more susceptible to vas￾cular complications but do not pose a significant 
compromise in the kidney’s vascular supply. These 
small branches sometimes cannot be adequately 
assessed during Doppler ultrasound and for this 
reason the vascular complications rate could even 
be higher. Despite these limitations, based on our 
results and others, we believe that multiple arteries 
should not be a contraindication for renal trans￾plantation. However, the patient must be aware 
that LDN in kidneys with MA may be associated 
with worst early renal function results.
CONCLUSIONS
Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy appears 
to be safe in patients with multiple renal arteries, 
with similar complications rates when compared 
to single artery allografts. The cold and warm 
ischemia times were significantly longer in the 
multiple arteries group. Allografts with multiple 
arteries had a non statistically significant higher 
rate of poor early graft function when compared 
to single artery allografts. Nevertheless, we believe 
that multiple arteries should not be a contraindi￾cation for laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.

Editorial Comment
Since the first descriptions of the lapa￾roscopic donor nephrectomy on 1995, the renal 
transplantation laparoscopic surgery has continu￾ously increased. Despite of the presence of renal 
donors with multiple renal arteries has initially 
been considered as a contraindication to the LDN, 
the upgrade of surgery technique and the expe￾rience of transplantation surgeons has increased 
over time and the challenges to perform LDN with 
MRA were overcome.
The authors evaluated your experience 
with 130 patients submitted to a laparoscopic do￾nor nephrectomy, comparing the results on pa￾tients with unique arteries versus the ones with 
multiple arteries, by the analysis of operational 
surgery results and precocious and late function 
of the graft.
Donor parameters analyzed included age, 
gender, operative time, warm ischemia time, es￾timated blood loss and recipient parameters in￾cluded age, gender, cold ischemia time, creatinine 
level at day 5, slow and delayed graft function 
rates, and early complications.
The LDN operative time was similar between 
the single artery and multiple arteries groups. Al￾lograft with multiple arteries had significantly lon￾ger warm ischemia time and cold ischemia time 
than those with single artery. The conversion rate 
was similar between single and multiple arteries 
groups. Multiple arteries grafts had a non statisti￾cally significant higher rate of poor graft function 
when compared to single artery grafts respectively. 
Overall, recipient complication rates were similar be￾tween single and multiple arteries groups.
The own authors does a self evaluation into 
your manuscript, since it is a retrospective study 
with a small sample of patients, especially in the 
multiple arteries group and the results regarding the 
renal function could be different. Second, the re￾nal function analysis was based only on early graft

function results, because previous reports have 
shown that early function results are associated 
with worst long term outcomes. Finally, they did 
not differentiate large renal arteries, such as po￾lar arteries.
The authors concluded that several re￾nal arteries represent a special challenge both 
on donor surgery and implant of the renal graft.
