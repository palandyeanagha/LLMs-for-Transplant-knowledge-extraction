Mycotic pseudoaneurysms complicating renal
transplantation: a case series and review of
literature
Polytimi Leonardou, Sofia Gioldasi, George Zavos and Paris Pappas*
Abstract
Introduction: Kidney transplantation can be complicated by infection and subsequent development of mycotic
aneurysm, endangering the survival of the graft and the patient. Management of this condition in five cases is
discussed, accompanied by a review of the relevant literature.
Case presentations: Five patients, three men 42-, 67- and 57-years-old and two women 55- and 21-years-old
(mean age of 48 years), all Caucasians, developed a mycotic aneurysm in the region of the anastomosis between
renal graft artery and iliac axes. Four patients presented with systemic fever and iliac fossa pain and one presented
with hemorrhagic shock. Morphologic investigation by color doppler ultrasonography revealed a pseudoaneurysm
at the anastomotic site. A combination of antibiotic therapy, surgery and interventional procedures was required as
all kidney transplants had to be removed. No recurrence was recorded during the follow-up period.
Conclusions: A high index of suspicion is required for the timely diagnosis of a mycotic aneurysm; aggressive
treatment with cover stents and/or surgical excision is necessary in order to prevent potentially fatal complications.

Introduction
The incidence of mycotic aneurysm formation following
renal transplantation is < 1%. A non-mycotic etiology
for aneurysm formation in the same setting has also
been recorded [1-3]. An aneurysm may be asympto￾matic, being an incidental finding during imaging eva￾luation for other reasons, yet it can occasionally cause
fever and anemia, iliac fossa discomfort, renal dysfunc￾tion and graft loss or even precipitate a lethal hemor￾rhage due to acute rupture [4]. Early recognition of this
entity based on a high index of suspicion and use of
early diagnostic procedures is vital for its successful
management. Therapeutic options include aneurysmect￾omy, proximal and distal ligation of the arterial trunk,
medical treatment and percutaneous embolization,
although the choice of prompt treatment strategy is still
a subject of debate, requiring further delineation.
We report the cases of five patients suffering from this
life-threatening complication and present the therapeu￾tic procedures used and their long-term outcomes
together with a literature review on this topic.
Case presentations
Case one
The first case is a 42-year-old Caucasian man, who was on
hemodialysis after rejection of a kidney allograft of
unknown etiology four years ago. Three months after
nephrectomy, the patient was admitted to our hospital
with diffuse pain in his right lower quadrant, acute ische￾mia of his right lower limb with the presence of petechiae
and a systemic temperature of 38°C. Angiographic investi￾gation revealed a pseudoaneurysm at the site of the pre￾vious arterial ligation and three balloon expandable cover
stents were deployed during the same procedure to
exclude the aneurysm (Figure 1). Following this interven￾tional procedure, the patient was continuously febrile
(38.5°C) and his blood examinations revealed leukocytosis.
He then developed clinical signs of thromboembolism, * Correspondence: pappasparis@hotmail.com

which were confirmed by angiography (Figure 2). Subse￾quent treatment involved embolectomy and the histologi￾cal examination of the thrombus identified mucorales
hyphae. Histological examination also revealed mucorales
infection of the stents. The patient underwent surgery for
removal of both the mycotic aneurysm and the stents, and
for construction of a suprapubic femoral-femoral by-pass.
He also received amphotericin B for three months. No
recurrence or any other major complication has been
recorded during a follow-up period of eight years and he
was able later on to undergo a kidney transplantation
successfully.
Cases two and three
One man, 67-years-old, and one woman, 55-years-old,
both Caucasian, had previously received a transplant from
cadaveric donors, and presented with fever and abdominal
pain located at the left iliac fossa. Color doppler ultrasono￾graphy (CDU) examination revealed the presence of a
hypoechoic mass at the hilus of the transplanted kidney
with bidirectional or swirling blood flow within its lumen.
In both cases the blood cultures grew pseudomonas aer￾uoginosa. Both patients received ciprofloxacin intravenously
for eight days and then orally for another three weeks. The
subsequent angiographic investigation revealed a pseudoa￾neurysm formation (Figure 3). They were both treated with
covered stent insertion followed later on by nephrectomy.
They remain on hemodialysis without any reoccurrence of
vascular infection evident on regular examination. The fol￾low-up period ranges from 18 up to 36 months.
Case four
A 57-year-old Caucasian man developed a pseudoaneur￾ysm three months after transplantectomy, at the site of
the former transplant artery ligation. He presented with
signs of right lower quadrant pain and tenderness, fever
and weakness. CDU examination revealed a pseudoa￾neurysm. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from
blood cultures. He received intravenous antibiotic ther￾apy (colistin) and a week later two balloon expandable
covered stents were placed to exclude the aneurysmal
sac from the external iliac artery (Figure 4). He was dis￾charged home without complications and was living
independently at his 14-month follow-up.
Case five
The fifth patient was a 21-year-old Caucasian woman, who
had received a renal transplant from a living donor 15

months previously and subsequently developed a mycotic
pseudoaneurysm. Apart from iliac fossa pain and fever,
there were also signs of abdominal hemorrhage. CDU
examination revealed the presence of an aneurysm at the
anastomotic region and retroperitoneal blood collection.
Blood cultures grew Candida which was treated with intra￾venous liposomal amphotericin. Percutaneous
transluminal treatment was suggested and the pseudoa￾neurysm was initially packed with coils followed by place￾ment of a covered stent, aiming to keep patent the
transplant renal artery (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8). After a short,
clinically stable, postoperative period, reappearance of a
pseudoaneurysm was recorded (Figure 9); this was treated
by insertion of a second covered stent (Figure 10) and

renal transplant removal with successful surgical restora￾tion of iliac arteries. Antifungal therapy with oral flucona￾zole had been continued for two months.
Discussion
Infection of the artery at or around the site of anasto￾mosis is an ominous complication commonly presenting
as an anastomotic leak or local dissolution of the arterial
wall [5]. Mycotic aneurysm is a rare infectious complica￾tion, associated with high morbidity and mortality rates,
while the prompt treatment modality remains a subject
of debate. Small, asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms can be
managed conservatively by regular monitoring, while
early diagnosis and timely operation might be the most
important factors in the survival of patients with myco￾tic pseudoaneurysms [6,7]. However, an aneurysm
infected with candida is reported to have been success￾fully managed by conservative pharmacological means
during a period of 38 months follow-up [8].
Another point of interest is the need for nephrectomy
in the majority of renal transplant patients presenting
with pseudoaneurysm due to resistant rejection, function
failure or infection. A review of the literature found
reports of successful venous patch angioplasty and sur￾gical reconstruction of a renal artery aneurysm that pre￾vented aneurysm rupture and saved the graft [9,10].

With regard to our fourth patient, although we decided
on a two-stage procedure aiming to preserve the trans￾planted kidney, this was not feasible due to recurrence
of the pseudoaneurysm.
Another aspect of significant consideration is the need
for concomitant vascular reconstruction after surgical
aneurysmectomy. As Bracale et al. [11] suggest, after
investigation of 11 transplant recipients with mycotic
aneurysm formation, vascular reconstruction is advisable
since it prevents lower limb ischemia. Moreover, an
above-knee amputation was reported in a 25-year-old
woman who developed foot ischemia three months after
external iliac ligation [2].
With regard to our cases, survival of the first patient
was achieved due to a multi-disciplinary therapeutic
approach involving medical and surgical interventions.
There are published reports that support the efficacy of
only one treatment modality (either pharmacological or
interventional). On the other hand Liapis et al. [12],
presented a study in which 11 out of 17 patients with
mucorales infection who underwent surgery survived,
while the remaining ones who did not have surgery
died, thus reinforcing the view that medical therapy
alone is not sufficient. We agree with Liapis et al. and
remain sceptical of the proposed pathway of a single
treatment modality [13,14].
Conclusions
Taking into account the serious complications that can
arise from mycotic aneurysm we feel that increased
awareness and close monitoring are indispensable. The
benefits derived from early diagnosis and treatment are
indisputable. However, as a prompt therapeutic strategy
has not been delineated yet, prospective studies are
essential for thorough evaluation of treatment options.
