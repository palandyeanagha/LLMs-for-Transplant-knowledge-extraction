1. ABSTRACT 
Acute pancreatitis is a common clinical 
condition. Excessive systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS) in acute pancreatitis leads to distant organ 
damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
(MODS), which is the primary cause of morbidity and 
mortality in this condition. Development of in vivo
experimental models of acute pancreatitis and associated 
systemic organ damage has enabled us to study the role 
played by inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of 
acute pancreatitis and associated systemic organ damage. 
Using these models, recent studies by us and other 
investigators have established the critical role played by 
inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, PAF, 
IL-10, CD40L, C5a, ICAM-1, chemokines, substance P and 
hydrogen sulfide in acute pancreatitis and the resultant 
MODS. This chapter intends to present an overview of 
different experimental animal models of acute pancreatitis 
and associated MODS and the role of inflammatory 
mediators in the pathogenesis of this condition. 
2. INTRODUCTION 
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common clinical 
condition with potentially devastating consequences. It is 
one of the most frequent causes of acute inflammatory 
states in the abdomen. About 40 cases of AP per 100,000 
adults are reported every year. At present, there is no 
treatment against severe acute pancreatitis, other than 
supportive critical care (2). The main etiological factors of 
AP are biliary disease leading to ductal obstruction and 
excessive alcohol consumption. Other minor factors 
include hyperlipidemia, viral infection, drugs and 
hypercalcemia (3). The incidence of the disease differs 
geographically; however, the death rate of this disease has 
remained high at 8-13 % over the past 20 years. The 
severity of AP can vary from mild to severe in different 
cases. Majority of the patients (80 %) suffer mild 
pancreatitis, which is self-limiting and recover in a few 
days. The other 20 % may require intensive care treatment 
for haemorrhagic and necrotic lesions of the pancreas with 
a mortality rate of 40 %. High incidence of death is due to

Development of in vivo experimental models of 
acute pancreatitis and associated systemic organ damage 
has enabled us to study the role played by inflammatory 
mediators in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and 
associated systemic organ damage. Furthermore, specific 
therapeutic treatment for AP and its systemic complications 
has yet to be developed. As randomized studies of AP in 
the clinical setting have their limitations, in vivo animal 
studies are of particular importance. Moreover, targeted 
treatments need to be tested carefully before going to 
clinical trials to ensure that there are no harmful side 
effects. In this regard, reliable AP animal models are of 
paramount importance. An ideal AP animal model should 
reproduce the disease in terms of etiology, 
symptomatology, effectiveness in treatment and 
pathophysiology. Thus, the AP animal models developed 
ought to mimic the clinical AP such as increased serum 
pancreatic enzymes, histological changes, and pancreatitis￾associated complications. To that end, a variety of well￾developed AP animal models have been used by us and 
other investigators. The methods of induction can be non￾invasive or invasive, ranging from simple diet to exogenous 
chemical administration or even surgical manipulation￾induced pancreatitis. Some of the models are simple and 
repeatable, whereas the others are relatively complex. 
Some focus on etiology, while others are designed to be 
clinically relevant (2, 6). In this chapter, the different 
animal models of AP are discussed and compared (Table 
1). 
An important characteristic feature of AP is the 
pancreatic inflammation with excessive recruitment of 
leukocytes. Inflammatory mediators appear to play a 
critical role in pancreatitis and more so in the subsequent 
inflammatory response (1-5). Animal models of AP and 
associated SIRS have enabled us to investigate the role of 
inflammatory mediators in this condition. Inflammatory 
mediators believed to participate in the pathophysiology of 
this condition include: tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF￾α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), platelet
activating factor (PAF), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(ICAM-1), interleukin 10 (IL-10), CD40L, complement 
component C5a, chemokines, substance P and hydrogen 
sulfide (H2S) (1-5).
3. ANIMAL MODELS OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS 
AND ASSOCIATED SIRS 
3.1. Secretagogue-induced pancreatitis
Physiological concentrations of secretagogues 
trigger normal secretion from the pancreas. When excess of an 
exogenous secretagogue is given to the animals, the excess 
stimulation leads to abnormally high digestive enzyme 
secretion, resulting in AP. The cholecystokinin (CCK) 
analogue caerulein has been used to induce AP in rodents (7, 
8). Rapid induction, noninvasiveness, high repeatability, high 
applicability, and AP-like pancreatic histological changes have 
made caerulein the most favored AP animal model. As such, 
the pathophysiology of caerulein-induced pancreatitis has been 
evaluated extensively. Caerulein, acting through the CCK 
receptors, yields exaggerated stimulation of acinar cells, which 
leads to prematuration of trypsinogen. Caerulein, like other 
secretagogues, can be administrated via intraperitoneal 
injection (50 µg/kg body weight) or intravenous infusion (5 
µg/kg body weight). Variation in the amount of caerulein, by 
adjusting the number of injections, results in differences in 
degree of severity. We have shown earlier that when multiple 
injections of caerulein are given, quite severe AP can be 
achieved in mice and rats as evidenced by AP-associated 
pulmonary injury (8, 9). This model of AP is particularly 
useful because AP-associated pulmonary injury is a common 
complication, contributing significantly to the high mortality 
rate of AP. Another advantage of the secretagogue-induced 
model is the availability of parallel in vitro approach, using 
isolated pancreatic acini. Unlike other animal models of AP, 
secretagogues can be administered to isolated acini or exocrine 
cells in vitro to mimic hyperstimulation-induced pancreatitis 
3.2. Choline-deficient ethionine supplement diet￾induced pancreatitis 
 In 1975, Lombardi et al reported that female 
juvenile mice developed acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis 
with massive fat necrosis when fed a choline-deficient diet 

Acute pancreatitis as a model of SIRS
2044
supplemented with 0.5% dl-ethionine [(the ethyl analog of 
methionine) (CDE diet)] (10). The mortality rate was 100 
% after 4 days on the regimen and the animals consistently 
developed fat necrosis in the abdominal cavity. The precise 
mechanism of CDE diet-induced pancreatitis remains 
unclear; it has been hypothesized that ethionine may be 
toxic to the pancreas by interfering with RNA protein, and 
phospholipid metabolism (10). Choline deficiency may act 
synergistically with ethionine, increasing the severity of the 
condition. 
 CDE diet-induced pancreatitis is the most non￾invasive method of all of the experimental models of AP. It 
requires no injections or surgical manipulation; thus, exerts 
minimal exogenous shock. Moreover, it takes a rather long 
time, approximately 2 to 3 days, to produce pancreatitis. 
The slow progression of pancreatitis by CDE diet makes it 
suitable to observe the propagation of the disease. The 
limitation of this model, however, is that it is difficult to 
control the amount of the diet each animal consumes, and 
therefore variation between animals can be high, making 
the use of a large number of animals in each group 
necessary so as to get meaningful results. Another 
limitation of this model is that it is restricted to young 
female mice. Also, such a small animal can sometimes be 
difficult to manipulate, especially surgically or in 
therapeutic interventions involving intravenous 
administration. In our studies, we were able to establish 
evidence of lung injury associated with CDE diet-induced 
acute pancreatitis as well (11), which enabled us to 
investigate the role of neutrophils in AP and associated 
SIRS. 
3.3. Duct obstruction-induced pancreatitis 
 The duct obstruction model mimics gallstone 
obstruction-induced AP in the clinical setting. The surgical 
manipulation is simple, requiring either ligation of the 
common biliopancreatic duct (CBPD) or obstruction of the 
pancreatic duct by vertical cannulation or insertion of a 
balloon-tipped catheter (12). It is postulated that bile 
reflux, triggering intrapancreatic digestive enzyme 
activation, accounts for the major pathological factor of this 
model. This model is most effective in the American 
opossum, leading to severe necrotizing AP. 
 The duct obstruction model has high clinical 
relevance in that it simulates gallstone obstruction-induced 
AP. This major advantage has made this model a favorite 
for investigating the pathophysiology, as well as the 
therapeutic treatment of gallstone obstruction-induced 
pancreatitis. In our studies, we were able to establish 
evidence of lung injury associated with acute pancreatitis 
induced by biliopancreatic duct ligation in the opossum 
(13). 
3.4. Duct infusion-induced pancreatitis 
 Cannulation of the pancreatic duct provides 
another way of inducing an experimental model of AP. 
Once the cannula has been implanted, an exogenous 
substance can be infused into the pancreas via the 
pancreatic ductal system. Duct perfusion-induced 
pancreatitis is a well-established, reliable and highly 
repeatable model of AP with clinical relevance. It requires 
cannulation of the pancreatic duct (usually from the 
duodenum wall via the sphincter of Oddi), temporary 
closure of the biliary duct near the liver hilum, and slow 
retrograde infusion of a foreign solution into the pancreatic 
duct. The infusion rate is controlled by a pump that keeps 
the pressure from becoming too high throughout the 
experiment. Several substances have been used as inducers 
of AP, the most common being bile acids [taurocholate or 
glycodeoxycholic acid (GDOC)]. A distinct advantage of 
the duct perfusion model is the flexibility in studying 
different etiologic factors by simply varying the 
concentration of the substance infused into the pancreatic 
duct. A biliary edematous model of AP can be established 
by the infusion of a low concentration of GDOC, which can 
be converted to a necrotizing hemorrhagic form when given 
at a high concentration (34 mM). Animals subjected to this 
highly concentrated GDOC or taurocholate treatment 
exhibit very severe pancreatitis that is accompanied by 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 
manifested by pulmonary injury (14, 15). 
 The flexibility (in terms of etiology and severity 
of AP), repeatability, and clinical relevance associated with 
the duct perfusion-induced pancreatitis make it an excellent 
experimental model for AP studies. However, it requires 
careful monitoring of perfusion pressure and an invasive 
surgery. Infact, intraductal infusion of saline alone, which 
is neither a toxin nor a stimulant, has been reported to 
induce mild pancreatitis. Despite this drawback, the duct 
perfusion model remains a common model of AP for 
studies examining pathophysiology of AP and potential 
therapies for AP because of its similarity to clinical 
pancreatitis. 
3.5. Arginine-induced pancreatitis
 Treatment with arginine can induce acute 
necrotizing pancreatitis in rats (16) and mice (17). AP is 
induced by a single high-dose intraperitoneal injection of 
arginine. The most effective dose of arginine for inducing 
AP lies between 250 and 500 mg/100 g body weight. The 
mechanism of arginine-induced AP remains to be fully 
understood. However, its toxicity in the pancreas is 
probably due to inhibition of protein synthesis, excessive 
nitric oxide production or lipid peroxidation. Excessive 
arginine, as well as other basic amino acids, could suppress 
ornithine decarboxylase, which is the rate-determining 
enzyme in polyamine synthesis. The resultant reduction in 
polyamine levels retards nucleic acid synthesis which may 
interfere with protein synthesis. Pancreatic tissue is 
particularly vulnerable to this form of toxicity because of 
its very active protein metabolism. 
 
Arginine-induced pancreatitis is a relatively non 
invasive AP animal model. A single injection of arginine is 
usually strong enough to induce acute necrotizing 
pancreatitis, although sometimes multiple injections may 
be required. The degree of severity of this animal model 
depends upon the dose of arginine and time of exposure. 
Usually, mild histological deterioration, including 
interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar 
cell degranulation, is observed when arginine is

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Activation of various digestive 
enzymes in acinar cells leads to autodigestion of the pancreas and release of inflammatory mediators. When the inflammatory 
reaction is severe, it leads to pathological damages in various organs such as pancreas, lung and kidney and eventually death. The 
severity of acute pancreatitis is determined by an interplay of these pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. The time between 
symptom onset in acute pancreatitis and the development of distant organ dysfunction provides an ideal therapeutic window in 
this condition. 
administrated in low doses. However, higher doses of 
arginine can cause SIRS leading to lung injury in severe AP 
(18). Its specificity, efficiency and flexibility in controlling 
the degree of severity have made it a common non-invasive 
model of AP in recent years. 
One of the disadvantages of arginine-induced 
pancreatitis is its lack of clinical relevance. Because of this 
reason, the popularity of the arginine-induced model of AP 
has faded in recent years. 
Table 1 summarizes the most prevalent animal 
models of AP discussed in this section. 
4. MEDIATORS OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS￾ASSOCIATED SIRS IDENTIFIED USING ANIMAL 
MODELS 
4.1. TNF-α and IL-1β
Both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are derived predominantly from 
activated macrophages and act via specific cell membrane 
bound receptors. Levels of both these pro-inflammatory 
mediators are elevated upon the onset and during the 
progress of acute pancreatitis (19, 20). Naturally occurring 
soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR) and interleukin-1 receptor 
antagonist (IL-1ra), by neutralizing the activity of TNF-α
and IL-1β respectively, act as anti-inflammatory mediators 
(19). Intrapancreatic TNF-α and IL-1β are detectable one 
hour following induction of acute pancreatitis and levels 
increase rapidly over the following six hours (19, 20). Both 
TNF-α and IL-1β are thought to play an important role in 
acute pancreatitis. 
Combined infusions of TNF-α and IL-1β have 
synergistic pro-inflammatory effects. Using knockout mice 
deficient in IL-1 type 1 receptors, TNF type 1 receptors or 
both, it has been shown that IL-1β and TNF-α make an 
equivalent contribution to the severity of an attack. 
Preventing the activity of both cytokines concurrently has 
no additional effect on the degree of pancreatitis but does 
attenuate the systemic stress response and is associated 
with an additional but modest decrease in mortality (20). 
Numerous investigators have employed specific antagonists 
to TNF-α or IL-1β in experimental models of acute 
pancreatitis. Examples of this approach include the use of 
an anti-TNF-α antibody, soluble type 1 TNF receptor and 
IL-1ra (20, 21). Blockade of the IL-1 receptor before or 
soon after induction of pancreatitis is associated with 
decreased severity of pancreatitis and reduced intrinsic 

Acute pancreatitis as a model of SIRS

pancreatic damage. Also, neutralization of TNF-α with a 
polyclonal antibody significantly reduces the severity of 
acute pancreatitis in rats (21). 
4.2. IL-6 
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is produced by a wide range 
of cells including monocytes/macrophages, endothelial 
cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in response to 
stimulation by endotoxin, IL-1β and TNF-α (1-3). 
Transgenic mice overexpressing IL-6 are more susceptible 
to acute pancreatitis and in these mice monoclonal anti-IL￾6 antibody has a protective effect (22). 
4.3. IL-10 
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory 
cytokine. Its plasma levels are elevated in animal models of 
endotoxemia and inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (i.e. IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) from 
monocytes/macrophages thus preventing subsequent tissue 
damage. IL-10 also stimulates production of naturally 
occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and release of 
soluble p75 TNF receptor (23). IL-10 is believed to have a 
protective role in acute pancreatitis. Administration of IL￾10 in experimental acute pancreatitis reduces the local 
inflammatory response and subsequent mortality (23). 
4.4. PAF 
Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a low 
molecular weight phospholipid which acts via specific cell 
surface receptors that have been identified on numerous 
cells and tissues including platelets, leukocytes and 
endothelial cells (1-5). Isolated pancreatic acini have been 
reported to synthesize PAF and pancreatic tissue 
concentrations rise during the course of an attack. In animal 
models, intra-peritoneal or intravascular injection can bring 
about or increase the severity of acute pancreatitis (24). 
Blood and pulmonary tissue levels also rise co-ordinately 
indicating that PAF is a key mediator of the systemic 
inflammatory response (14). 
Specific PAF antagonists have been evaluated in 
experimental models with varying success. Prophylactic 
treatment with these antagonists causes a reduction in local 
inflammation and acinar cell necrosis, in several 
experimental models of acute pancreatitis (25, 26). In a 
recent study using a model of severe acute pancreatitis 
induced by infusion of bile salts into the pancreatic duct in 
combination with caerulein administered intravascularly, 
treatment with lexipafant, a PAF antagonist, had no effect 
either on survival or on local inflammation (26). 
PAF is inactivated by the enzyme platelet 
activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). In severe 
acute pancreatitis induced by the ligation of combined 
biliopancreatic duct in the opossum, there was significant 
protection against acute pancreatitis and associated lung 
injury by treatment with PAF-AH (13). 
4.5. CD40L 
CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) receptor family, is expressed on the membrane of a 
variety of cells, including B lymphocytes, monocytes, 
dendritic cells, and biliary epithelial cells. CD40 binds to 
its ligand CD40L (also referred to as CD154) to mediate 
major immunoregulatory signals (1-5). Although CD40L 
expression was previously thought to be restricted to 
activated T lymphocytes, this cell surface protein has been 
detected in various cell types, including macrophages, 
smooth muscle and endothelial cells. In pancreatic tissue 
from control mice and caerulein-treated mice, the 
expression of both CD40 and CD40L was detected on the 
acinar cell surface. Interestingly, pancreatitis and 
pancreatitis-associated lung injury were markedly 
decreased in mice deficient in CD40L compared with wild￾type mice, suggesting an important pro-inflammatory role 
of CD40L in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and 
associated lung injury (27). 
4.6. ICAM-1 
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; 
CD54) is an inducible protein expressed on the surface of 
endothelial cells. Under physiological conditions, ICAM-1 
is not constitutively expressed or is expressed at low levels 
in most tissues; during inflammation its levels are 
upregulated (1-5). ICAM-1 knockout mice are protected 
against acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury, 
pointing to an important role for ICAM-1 in the 
development of pancreatitis and subsequent organ damage 
(28). The protective effect of ICAM-1 gene deletion does 
not differ from that seen following neutrophil depletion in 
the choline-deficient, ethionine supplemented (CDE) diet 
model of acute pancreatitis (11). Indeed neutrophil 
depletion in ICAM-1 knockout mice affords no additional 
protection (28). Blocking ICAM 1 has been shown to have 
a protective effect against local and systemic organ damage 
in different experimental models of acute pancreatitis (29). 
These results suggest that ICAM-1 deficiency interferes 
with neutrophil recruitment and supports the concept of a 
therapeutic strategy directed against neutrophil migration 
and activation. 
4.7. C5a 
C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin and 
chemoattractant that is generated from C5 as part of both 
the classic and alternate pathways of complement 
activation. C5a, acting via C5aR on target cells, is generally 
believed to serve as a “complete” proinflammatory 
mediator. We evaluated the role of C5a in a model of 
pancreatitis and systemic injury after pancreatitis using two 
independent but complementary approaches. In the first, 
mice that do not express C5aR were used, whereas in the 
second set of experiments, mice that do not express C5 
were employed. The results of both studies were similar, 
i.e., interruption of C5a action either by deletion of its 
receptor or by deletion of its parent protein resulted in 
worsening of pancreatitis. The severity of pancreatitis￾associated lung injury was also increased when C5a action 
was rendered inoperative (30). 
4.8. Chemokines 
Leukocyte chemotaxis in acute pancreatitis is a 
well orchestrated process that involves a number of 
proteins, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion 
molecules, matrix metalloproteinases and the large 

Acute pancreatitis as a model of SIRS
2047
cytokine subfamily of chemotactic cytokines - the 
chemokines (1-5). Numerous chemokines have now been 
identified as inflammatory mediators with potent leukocyte 
activating properties and many of them have been shown to 
be involved in the patho-physiological process of 
experimental acute pancreatitis. 
Chemokines have been divided into four major 
sub-groups: C, CC, CXC and CX3C, on the basis of the 
position and spacing of N-terminal cysteine residues (1-5). 
Historically, CC chemokines (such as MCP-1, MIP-1α, 
RANTES) have been believed to act principally upon 
monocytes and CXC chemokines which contain a three 
amino acid ELR motif at the amino terminal end (such as 
IL-8, GRO-α, ENA-78) are believed to act upon 
neutrophils. Recent work has, however, shown that these 
narrow definitions are no longer valid (31-35). 
We have shown that pancreatic acinar cells 
produce the CC chemokine MCP-1 and that treatment with 
supramaximally stimulating doses of caerulein causes an 
upregulation of MCP-1 production. Caerulein-induced 
stimulation of chemokine production is regulated via NF￾κB and Ca2+ (31). 
The chemokines are an ideal target for anti￾inflammatory therapy. Of the rat CXC chemokines, the best 
characterised is CINC (cytokine-induced neutrophil 
chemoattractant). Circulating levels of CINC are raised in 
experimental acute pancreatitis (15) and treatment with 
neutralizing antibody against CINC protects rats against 
acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury (9). Furthermore, 
treatment with antileukinate, a hexapeptide antagonist of 
the CXCR2 chemokine receptor, protects mice against 
acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury (32). We have 
also shown that in knockout mice, the deletion of the MIP￾1α/RANTES receptor CCR1 decreased the pulmonary 
damage seen in severe acute pancreatitis. There was little 
protection against pancreatic damage (33). Similarly, 
treatment with Met-RANTES, a CCR1 antagonist, 
protected mice against acute pancreatitis-associated lung 
injury, with little protection against pancreatic damage 
(34). In a recent study, we have shown that treatment with a 
small molecule CCR1 antagonist BX 471 protects mice 
against acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury (35). 
These studies show the critical role of chemokines in the 
pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and associated lung 
injury. 
There are over 50 different chemokines and over 
20 different receptors with overlapping functions. Despite 
the complexity and apparent redundancy of this system, it 
is reasonable to believe that specific chemokine receptor 
antagonists, that interfere with leukocyte migration and 
activation, could be useful in acute pancreatitis. 
4.9. Substance P 
Substance P is an 11 amino acid neuropeptide 
that is released from nerve endings. Subsequent to its 
release, substance P binds to neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors 
on the surface of effector cells and in addition to being a 
mediator of pain it plays an important role in inflammation. 
In the first study on the role of substance P as a mediator of 
inflammation in AP and associated SIRS, we have shown 
the presence of substance P in the pancreas and of NK1 
receptors on pancreatic acinar cells in mice (8). On 
induction of pancreatitis, there is a several fold 
upregulation of pancreatic substance P levels and of NK1 
receptors on pancreatic acinar cells (8). Moreover, 
knockout mice deficient in NK1 receptors are protected 
against pancreatitis. Interestingly, these mice are almost 
completely protected against pancreatitis-associated lung 
injury (8). In a subsequent paper, we have highlighted the 
role of preprotachykinin-A (PPT-A) gene products (e.g. 
substance P and neurokinin-A) in the pathogenesis of acute 
pancreatitis and associated lung injury (36). NK1 receptors 
bind other peptides in addition to substance P, not all of 
which are derived from the PPT-A gene. We have also 
found that knockout mice deficient in the PPT-A gene were 
protected against acute pancreatitis and associated lung 
injury (36). Furthermore, both prophylactic and therapeutic 
treatments with CP-96,345, an antagonist of the NK1 
receptor, protected mice against acute pancreatitis and 
associated lung injury (37). These three papers (8, 36, 37) 
clearly show that PPT-A gene products, acting via NK1 
receptors, are critical pro-inflammatory mediators in acute 
pancreatitis and the associated lung injury. In a more 
recent study, we have shown a differential regulation of 
tachykinins and tachykinin receptors in the pancreas and 
lungs in acute pancreatitis (38). In another recent study, we 
have shown a differential regulation of adhesion molecules 
in acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury (39). These 
early results point to a differential regulation of 
inflammation in the pancreas and lungs, an interesting 
concept that merits further study. 
More recent studies have also shown that 
substance P can induce the synthesis of chemokines. In the 
first study on the interaction of substance P and 
chemokines in acute pancreatitis, we have recently shown 
an interaction of SP with chemokines in pancreatic acinar 
cells (40). SP was found to stimulate chemokine synthesis 
in pancreatic acinar cells (40). This is the first direct 
evidence of the role of substance P, acting via NK-1R 
present on mouse pancreatic acini, in inflammation and 
points to the mechanism by which SP contributes to 
inflammation in AP. 
We have also shown that there are temporally and 
spatially selective chemokine responses in CCK 
secretagogue caerulein-induced acute necrotizing 
pancreatitis in mice. CC chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1α
and CXC chemokine MIP-2 are elevated after induction of 
AP. They are early mediators in AP, mediating both local 
as well as systemic inflammatory responses. In contrast, 
another CC chemokine RANTES is only involved in local 
pancreatic inflammation at a later stage of the disease. 
Either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with a potent 
selective NK-1R antagonist CP-96,345 significantly 
suppressed caerulein-induced increase in MCP-1, MIP-1α
and MIP-2 expression but had no apparent effect on 
RANTES expression (41). Our data suggests SP, probably 
by acting via NK-1R upon various chemokine-secreting 
cells in the pancreas and lungs, stimulates the release of 

Acute pancreatitis as a model of SIRS
2048
chemokines that aggravate local AP and the development 
of its systemic sequelae. 
These results demonstrate the critical role played 
by substance P in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and 
point to a potential therapeutic approach against this 
clinical condition. 
4.10. H2S 
The toxic effect of H2S on living organisms has 
been recognized for nearly three hundred years. However, 
growing evidence has accumulated in recent years which 
suggests that H2S is formed naturally in mammalian tissues 
and exhibits a range of biological and physiological 
functions. Cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), which utilizes L￾cysteine as substrate, is the enzyme responsible for the 
production of H2S in mammalian vascular tissues. In a 
recent paper, we have shown the presence of H2S 
synthesizing enzyme activity and CSE (as determined by 
mRNA signal) in the pancreas. Also, prophylactic as well 
as therapeutic treatment with the CSE inhibitor, DL￾propargylglycine (PAG), significantly reduced the severity 
of caerulein-induced pancreatitis and associated lung injury 
(42). This study has shown H2S as a novel inflammatory 
mediator that plays a key role in acute pancreatitis and 
associated lung injury. 
Recently, we have investigated the involvement 
of substance P and neurogenic inflammation in H2S￾induced lung inflammation. Intraperitoneal administration 
of NaHS, an H2S donor, to mice caused a significant 
increase in circulating levels of substance P in a dose￾dependant manner. H2S alone could also cause lung 
inflammation, as evidenced by a significant increase in 
lung myeloperoxidase activity and histological evidence of 
lung injury. Maximum effects of H2S on substance P levels 
and on lung inflammation were observed 1 h after NaHS 
administration. At this time, a significant increase in lung 
levels of TNF-α and IL-1β was also observed. In 
substance P deficient mice, the preprotachykinin-A 
(PPT-A) knockout mice, H2S did not cause any lung 
inflammation. Furthermore, pre-treatment of mice with 
the NK1 receptor antagonist CP-96,345 protected mice 
against lung inflammation caused by H2S. Depleting 
neuropeptide from sensory neurons by capsaicin 
significantly reduced the lung inflammation caused by 
H2S. In addition, pre-treatment of mice with 
capsazepine, an antagonist of the transient receptor 
potential vanilloid (TRPV)-1, protected mice against 
H2S-induced lung inflammation. These results 
demonstrate a key role of substance P and neurogenic 
inflammation in H2S-induced lung injury in mice (43). 
Treatment of mouse acinar cells with H2S donor drug, 
sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) showed a significant 
increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A 
and NK1-R genes [44]. These results suggest that the 
pro-inflammatory effect of H2S may be mediated by SP￾NK-1R related pathway in pancreatic acinar cells. 
Recent evidence also points to a dual pro- and anti￾inflammatory role of H2S in AP, depending on the rate 
of release (45). A possible interaction between H2S and 
substance P in AP will be the subject of future studies. 
5. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVE 
Significant progress has been made in recent 
years in our awareness on the role of inflammatory 
mediators in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and 
associated SIRS. In most of the studies, experimental 
animal models were used, and these models have been 
invaluable in assessing the role of inflammatory mediators 
in AP and investigating novel therapeutic targets. Early 
studies have shown clinical relevance of these findings, 
which proves the usefulness of studies in employing 
appropriate experimental models. An understanding of the 
elucidation of the key mediators of inflammation in acute 
pancreatitis and associated MODS coupled with the 
discovery of specific inhibitors is likely to make it possible 
to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy 
for this, as yet incurable, clinical condition.
