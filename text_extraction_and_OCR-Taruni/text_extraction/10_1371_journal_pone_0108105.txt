Abstract
Background: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease and its prevalence rate increases with social
aging. The degradation of elastic is an important factor in the formation of AAA.
Methods: Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from rats,
and identified by Oil red O and alizarin red staining after adipogenesis and osteogenesis induction. In addition, ADSCs were
also identified by flow cytometry with CD markers. AAA model in rats was established, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were
isolated from AAA aortic wall and identified by immunohistochemistry. ADSCs or BMSCs were co-cultured with AAA aortic
wall for in vitro experiment, and ADSCs were injected into AAA model for in vivo test. Then orcein staining was used for
observing the morphology of elastic fiber, Western blot and real-time PCR were used respectively to detect the protein and
gene expression of elastin, gelatinases spectrum analysis was used to detect the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2
(MMP-2) and MMP-9.
Results: Lots of red lipid droplets were visible by Oil red O staining after adipogenesis induction, and black calcium nodules
appeared by alizarin red staining after osteogenesis induction. The results of flow cytometry showed that ADSCs expressed
CD44 and CD105, but exhibited negligible expression of CD31 and CD45. SMCs exhibited spindle-like morphology and a￾actin protein was positive in cytoplasm. After co-cultured with ADSCs or BMSCs, the elastic fiber recovered normal winding
shape, both the gene and protein expression of elastin increased, and the activity of MMP-2 decreased. The in vivo result
was similar to that of in vitro.
Conclusions: ADSCs promote the expression of elastin in SMCs and contribute to the reconstruction of elastic fiber, which
may provide new ideas for treating AAA.

Introduction
Aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening disease and its prevalence
rate increases with social aging [1]. The localized abdominal aorta
expansion, which exceeds more than 50% of the normal vessel
diameter, is called abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The tunica
media accounts for more than 90% of the abdominal aortic wall,
and mainly composed of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as well as the
elastic fiber. Many factors are possibly involved in the formation of
AAA, such as chronic inflammation, increase of proteolytic
pathways, oxidative stress and the decrease of matrix in the aortic
wall [2]. It has also been demonstrated that inflammation may
play an important role in aneurysm progression, through the
elastin breakdown and SMCs apoptosis mediated by inflammatory
cells infiltration and activation of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) [3]. It has also been found that AAA could be eased by
limiting proinflammatory signals in rats, and the expansion of
AAA was positively correlated to inflammatory infiltration [4].
The traditional treatment methods for AAA are medical follow￾up and surgical procedure. For large, high fracture risk of AAA,
open surgery or endovascular repair is now widely accepted [5].
However, most of the AAA is small and does not reach the
standard for operation. On the other hand, surgical mortality and
high risk of complications for surgeons and patients are both
serious challenge, so we must pay attention to the non-surgical
treatment method [6]. It has been reported that some drug
receptors could control the development of the AAA in
experimental model, and part have been clinically tested.
However, the results of clinical trials were not satisfying [7]. With
the progress of stem cell research, using stem cells to treat AAA
become an increasingly important idea. This kind of cell
population is easily separated, and can differentiate into bone,

cartilage, heart, etc. under certain conditions, like bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Furthermore, ADSCs has some
advantages over BMSCs, such as widespread, easily accessible,
small trauma, so it becomes a new hotspot of current research. In
addition, ADSCs have the effect of the anti-infection and
promoting wound healing [8–10]. It hasn’t been reported so far
that ADSCs were used for treating AAA.
In the present study, we have investigated the effect of rat
ADSCs on elastin secretion of SMCs in AAA model in vitro or in
vivo. Then the study provided a base for the therapy of AAA by
ADSCs.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Animal
Research Committee of China Medical University. The protocol
was approved by the Animal Research Committee of National
Defense Medical Center (IACUC-11-051). All surgery was
performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts
were made to minimize suffering. Animals were housed individ￾ually, and were controlled daily by the research team and the
animal house staff.
Isolation, culture and identification of ADSCs
Male SD rats weighing 120 g–150 g were selected and
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3% sodium pentobar￾bital (30 mg/kg), then disinfected in 75% alcohol. The rat skin was
cut along the belly line, muscle tissue was separated and groin
subcutaneous fat was cut off. Sterile phosphate buffer solution
(PBS) was used to remove blood cells, then adipose tissue was
transferred into a small dish and cut into pieces with an eye scissors
(volume of debris ,1 mm3
). The debris was digested with 0.1%
collagenase solution of type I (Gibco-BRL, Paisley, UK) for 40–
50 min at 37uC, then digestion was terminated with DMEM/F12
(DMEM; Gibco-BRL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco-BRL) and centrifuged at 4uC, 1500 rpm for 5 min. The
supernatant was discarded, sediment was suspended with
DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and filtrated with strainer of
200 mesh. Then the filter liquor was centrifuged at 4uC, 1500 rpm
for 5 min, and the sediment was resuspended in DMEM-FBS,
then transferred into dish and cultured at 37uC with 5% CO2 and
saturated humidity conditions.
After the third passage, the ADSCs were digested with 0.25%
trypsin, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 0.56105 cells/
ml. The cells were then inoculated onto 6-well plates and replaced
with inducing medium when cell fusion reached 90%. The
adipogenesis inducing medium including 0.5 mM isobutyl-meth￾ylxanthine (IBMX), 1 mM dexamethasone, 10 mM insulin,
200 mM indomethacin, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. The osteogen￾esis inducing medium including 0.01 mM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3, 50 mM ascorbate-2-phosphate, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate,
1% antibiotic/antimycotic [11]. After 2 weeks of adipogenesis
induction, oil red O staining was conducted; after 4 weeks of
osteogenesis induction, alizarin red staining was conducted.
In addition, the ADSCs expanded to passage three were
examined for surface marker expression using flow cytometry.
Briefly, the cultured ADSCs were harvested and washed twice
with cold PBS. After centrifugation and removal of the superna￾tants, the cells were resuspended and incubated with blocking
buffer for 30 min at 4uC. Following washing with PBS, the cells
were incubated for 30 min at 4uC in the dark with PE -conjugated
monoclonal antibodies against CD31 CD44 CD45 CD105
(eBioscience). Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a
FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed
using CellQuest software.
Isolation, culture and identification of BMSCs
Male SD rats weighing 120 g–150 g were selected and
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3% sodium pentobar￾bital (30 mg/kg), then disinfected in 75% alcohol. Then the femur
was separated from muscle and fascia, and the two ends were cut
off. All the contents of bone marrow were transferred to culture
dish by injection syringe containing DMEM/F12 plus 10% FBS,
then cultured at 37uC with 5% CO2 and saturated humidity
conditions. After 3–5 days, the BMSCs grew adherent to the wall
while hematopoietic cell suspended in medium because of its
characteristic, so changing the medium could remove these
nonadherent cells and retain BMSCs. The medium was changed
twice weekly and subculture was done when cells reached 80%
confluence.
After the third passage, the BMSCs were digested with 0.25%
trypsin, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 0.56106 cells/
ml. The cells were then inoculated onto 6-well plates and replaced
with inducing medium when cell fusion reached 90%. The
adipogenesis inducing medium including basic high-glucose
DMEM supplemented with 1.0 mM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM
IBMX, 10 mM insulin, 200 mM indomethacin, 10% FBS, 1%
penicillin G-streptomycin, and 5.6 mg/L of amphotericin B. The
osteogenesis inducing basic high-glucose DMEM supplemented
with 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate,
0.05 mM ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin G￾streptomycin, and 5.6 mg/L of amphotericin B [11]. After 2 weeks
of adipogenesis induction, oil red O staining was conducted; after
4 weeks of osteogenesis induction, alizarin red staining was
conducted.
AAA model
The experimental AAA model was established by CaCl2
infiltration, whereas saline was used in the control group [12].
Rats were first anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3%
sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg), then sheared and disinfected in
the supine position. An incision was made on the abdominal
median, and the abdominal cavity was exposed. Then the
abdominal aortic below the renal artery and above the iliac artery
was dissociated out, and covered by a polyethylene sponge
containing 0.75 M CaCl2 solution or saline. Meanwhile, the
surrounding tissue was protected from the calcium salt infiltration
by the sponge encapsulated with sterile rubber strips. After 30
minutes, the sponge and rubber strips were removed and the
peritoneal cavity was washed with saline for three times. The
incision was sutured layer by layer. Four weeks after the operation,
animals were anesthetized and abdominal aorta was isolated for
the following assays.
The co-culture of ADSCs or BMSCs and aortic wall of AAA
model
The SD rats of AAA model were anesthetized and abdominal
cavity was opened. Then cut off the aorta begin from beneath the
diaphragm to the common iliac artery bifurcation, washed the
blood with precooling PBS, and co-cultured with ADSCs or
BMSCs for 7, 14 and 21 d. The AAA aortic wall cultured alone
was used as the control group. Each group had 5 samples, and all
experiments were repeated for three times. After that, the AAA
aortic wall was fixed in 4% formaldehyde or preserved at 280uC
for the follow-up test.

The primary culture and identification of vascular SMCs
The aorta of AAA model was cut off according to the previous
method. Then cut into pieces and transferred them into culture
dish. The tissue pieces distributed and adhered to the bottom of
dish after culturing for 4 h. Then high glucose DMEM (H￾DMEM) plus 20% FBS was added, and cultured at 37uC with 5%
CO2 and saturated humidity conditions. After 4 days, cells freed
out around the tissue and subculture was done when cells reached
80% confluence. After the third passage, the SMCs were
conducted with immunohistochemical staining for a-actin.
In vivo experiments
After the third passage, the ADSCs were adjusted to 46106
cells/ml and implanted into the artery through the common
carotid artery with a 1-ml syringe (0.5 ml per rat). The group that
underwent implantation with the ADSCs, saline and PBS were
defined respectively as the ADSCs group, sham-operated group
and control group. Each group had six rats. After transplantation
for 28 d, the abdominal aortic wall was taken out by surgery for
gelatin enzyme spectrum analysis, orcein staining and Western
blot detection.
Orcein staining
Orcein staining was used to observe the morphology of elastin.
The AAA aortic wall was fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 24 h,
dehydrated successively in 10%, 20%, 30% sucrose, then frozed
rapidly in liquid nitrogen, embedded with embedding medium
and prepared for slices of 8 mm. After placed at room temperature
for 1 h, the slices were stained with orcein dye solution for 2 h,
then immersed in 95% alcohol for 2 to 3 min and washed off
excess dye solution. After dehydration, transparent and seal, the
slices were observed with microscope.
Western blot
After co-cultured with ADSCs or BMSCs for 0, 7, 14 and 21 d
in vitro, or injection of ADSCs into AAA model for 28 d, the AAA
aortic wall was washed off with PBS, cut into pieces, lysed with
RIPA buffer and determined protein concentration by the
Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein (40 mg) were used
for Western blot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to anti￾elastin (abcam, ab23747, 1:1000 dilution). Specific antibody
binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit antibodies and visualized with ECL reagent (Santa
cruz) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Antibody to b￾actin was used to evaluate protein loading in each lane.
Gelatin zymogram
Expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed using a gelatin
zymogram [13]. After co-cultured with ADSCs in vitro or injected
with ADSCs in vivo, the AAA aortic wall was isolated and washed
with PBS, then cut into pieces in the ice and homogenized
(12000 g for 30 min) at 4uC. Protein concentration was deter￾mined using a BCA assay, and 50 mg of protein was loaded onto
7.5% Tris-glycine gels with 1 g/L gelatin. Following electropho￾resis, gels were washed with distilled water and placed in 2.5%
Triton X-100 for washing out SDS, and then incubated at 37uC
with gelatinases buffer for 16 h. Gels were stained with 0.1%
coomassie blue R-250 and then destained and qualified. A mixture
of human MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA)
was utilized as standard control. The width and brightness of
negative dyed stripe reflected the enzyme activity of gelatin.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT￾PCR)
The gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and elastin in SMCs
were detected by qRT-PCR after co-culture with ADSCs. The co￾culture of SMCs and ADSCs was performed in a transwell system.
For that 66104 ADSCs were seeded onto a polyester membrane
transwell-clear insert (Corning, 0.4 mm) while SMCs were seeded
onto the bottom of a six-well cell culture plate in the same cell
density. After co-cultured for 24, 48 and 72 h respectively, total
RNA was isolated from SMCs using the Trizol plus Kit (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and quantitated using
NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE). Then the RNA
was reverse transcribed into cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent
Kit With gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa). QRT-PCR was performed
using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (TaKaRa) on ABI 7500 Real￾Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Sequences of the primers
for MMP 2 were 59- GATACAGGTGTGCCAAGGTG- 39
(forward) and 59- AAAGGGCAAACAAAGCAAAC -39 (reverse),
MMP 9 were 59- CTGCAGTGCCCTTGAACTAA -39 (forward)
and 59- TATCCGGCAAACTAGCTCCT-39 (reverse), elastin
were 59- CATCGGTGGCTTAGGAGTCT-39 (forward) and 59-
GAAGACCGACACCAGGAACT -39 (reverse). Sequences of the
primers for GAPDH were 59- AGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATGTC
-39 (forward) and 59- TGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT -39
(reverse). The PCR amplification was done at: 95uC for 30 sec;
95uC for 5 sec, 60uC for 34 sec for 40 cycles. The relative changes
in gene expression data were analyzed by the 2-DDCT method.
GAPDH was used as an internal control. Triplicates were run for
each sample in three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis
The results were presented as Mean 6 Standard deviation
(S.D.) of triplicate determinations. The data were processed using
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 16.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). One-way ANOVA was performed for
comparison between different groups. Comparisons between
groups were conducted using the Tukey Bonferroni test. P values
of ,0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
Results
The morphology of ADSCs in primary culture and
differentiation
During the first day after plating, ADSCs adhered to the plastic
surfaces of 6-well plates, as a small population of polygonal or
spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 1a). Then ADSCs propagated rapidly in
vitro, and showed a homogenous fibroblast-like morphology at
7 d. These cells need to be passaged two to three times in a week,
after achieving a confluence of 80–90% (Fig. 1b). After adipogen￾esis induction, a lot of red lipid droplets were clearly visible by Oil
red O staining (Fig. 1c). At 14 d of osteogenesis induction, cells
begin to deformation, gathered together, and radiate out. At 28 d,
nodular cells mass was visible, as well as red and black calcium, by
alizarin red staining (Fig. 1d). Flow cytometry analyses demon￾strated that ADSCs expressed CD44 and CD105, but exhibited
negligible expression of CD31 and CD45 (Fig. 1e, f, g, h). After
statistical analysis, the results were shown as Table 1.
The morphology of BMSCs in primary culture and
differentiation
Primary cultured BMSCs grew slowly and showed pleomor￾phism shape (Fig. 2a). At day 10, cells exhibited a fibroblast shape
with a unique vortex arrangement at 90% confluence (Fig. 2b).

After subculture for three passages or more, BMSC cultures were
homogenous populations. At 10 d after adipogenesis induction,
cells had morphological changes, gradually in square shape, and
red lipid droplets in the cell were visible by Oil red O staining
(Fig. 2c). At about 28 d of osteogenesis induction, black calcium
nodules appeared by alizarin red staining (Fig. 2d).
The morphology change of elastic fiber in aortic wall
After co-cultured with ADSCs or BMSCs for 0, 7, 14 and 21 d
in vitro, AAA aortic wall was stained with orcein. The AAA aortic
wall without co-culture was used as control group. In co-cultured
group, the elastic fiber arranged closely and showed winding shape
at 14 d and 21 d, which was similar to the structure of normal
aortic wall (Fig. 3a1–a4, 3b1–b4). There was no significant
difference between ADSCs and BMSCs group. The results of
orcein staining showed that elastic fiber in control group became
flat and straight (Fig. 3c1–c4). In vivo experiment, the elastic fiber
also appeared wavy shape after injection of ADSCs, while that in
control group or sham-operated group was straight and thinner
(Fig. 3d, e, f).
ADSCs contribute to the protein expression of elastin in
vitro or in vivo
The result of Western blot showed that the protein expression of
elastin gradually increased with time after co-cultured with ADSCs
or BMSCs compared with that of control group, and that in
ADSCs co-culture group was significantly greater than that in
BMSCs co-culture group at 21 d (Fig. 4a, c, P = 0.001). The

relative protein expression of elastin in ADSCs group was
1.0460.03 at 21 d, while that in BMSCs group was 0.7660.02
(Fig. 4c). However, the protein expression of elastin gradually
decreased with time in control group (Fig. 4a, c). In vivo
experiment, the protein expression of elastin increased significantly
in ADSCs group, compared with sham-operated group or control
group (Fig. 4b, d, P = 0.011, P = 0.013).
ADSCs inhibited the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in
vitro or in vivo
The result of gelatinases spectrum analysis showed that the
expression of pro-MMP-2 (72KD) and active MMP-2 (62KD)
gradually decreased along with time in ADSCs co-culture group
(Fig.5a). By contrast, the expression of MMP-2 gradually increased
with time in control group, especially the active MMP-2 (Fig. 5b).
In vivo experiment, the expression of pro-MMP-9 (92 kD), active
MMP-9 (83KD), pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2 in ADSCs group
was less than that in sham-operated group or control group
(Fig. 5c), especially MMP-2. Therefore we speculated that the
increase of gelatinase activity in this experimental aneurysm was
mainly MMP-2, rather than MMP-9, and MMP-2 might play a
more important role than MMP-9 in aneurysm formation.
The morphology of SMCs in primary culture and
identification
After 4 d of primary culture, cells were visible around tissue
blocks (Fig. 6a). At day 7 of plating, SMCs exhibited the typical
spindle-like morphology under optical microscope (Fig. 6b), which
was similar to the morphology of SMCs in normal aortic wall
(Fig. 6d). The result of immunohistochemistry for a-actin showed
brown protein in cytoplasm (Fig. 6c).
The gene expression of elastin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in
SMCs
QRT-PCR was used to detect the gene expression of elastin,
MMP-2 and MMP-9 in SMCs after co-cultured with ADSCs for
24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The result showed that the melting curves of
GAPDH, elastin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were standard single peak,
indicating specific amplification products (Fig.7a). In co-culture
with ADSCs group, the gene expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9
increased and reached a climax at 48 h, and decreased after that,
especially at 96 h. The gene expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9

had no significant difference in normal control group, while that
increased with time in AAA control group (Fig.7b, P = 0.009,
P = 0.027). However, the gene expression of elastin increased with
time in ADSCs co-cultured group (Fig.7b, P = 0.00), while that in
normal control group and AAA control group had no significant
difference (Fig. 7b, P = 0.052, P = 0.073).
Discussion
AAA is usually a localized expansion associated with athero￾sclerosis, and its incidences increase with age [14]. Conventional
treatment method is replacing diseased blood vessels with artificial
blood vessels. But the accompanying risk factors such as leakage as
well as re-intervention rate are higher than that in open surgery
[15]. In AAA, the elastic plate of middle lamella of artery was
damaged, the number of SMCs decreased, and the invasion of
inflammatory cells led to the expansion of arterial wall. The
foundation of extracellular matrix remodeling include the steady
state of extracellular matrix synthesis in arterial wall of SMCs, the
quantity and normal function of SMCs and the protease produced
by inflammatory cells, which maintain normal morphology of
arterial wall. The causes of aneurysms involved a variety of factors,
but if the balance among them was broken, AAA occurred.
According to reports, the decrease of elastin in AAA was related
to the excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs,
both in the clinical field [16] or in animal models [17]. MMPs are
large family, named dependent on zinc and other metal ions, and
controlled by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) [18].
The imbalance of excessive elastin degradation is the main cause
of aneurysms. Therefore, inhibiting MMPs or increasing the
secretion of TIMPs or a combination of both would be a way to
limit the development of aneurysms. In fact, MMPs inhibitors
applied in vivo have been reported [19]. In recent years, studies
have shown that ADSCs could inhibit tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory
cytokines-interleukin-10 [20]. Whether ADSCs can inhibit secre￾tion of MMPs or not hasn’t been reported. In this experiment, we
co-cultured AAA aortic wall and ADSCs in vitro, injected ADSCs
into rat model of AAA in vivo, then extracted protein from aortic
wall and conducted gelatin zymography detection, and the results
showed that the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 significantly
reduced. In addition, SMCs were isolated from AAA aortic wall
and co-cultured with ADSCs, the result showed that the gene
expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 also decreased significantly,
which demonstrated that ADSCs inhibited the secretion of MMPs
and might affect the development of AAA.
Elastin is a kind of extracellular matrix protein and plays an
indispensable role in maintaining vascular elasticity. The content
of elastin is the most abundant among all proteins in aorta wall
[21], and gradually degenerated with age [22]. In animal models,
the degradation of elastic plate led to expansion, sclerosis and
dysfunction of arterial wall, and ultimately resulted in aneurysm
formation or rupture of blood vessels [23]. Although pathological
features of aortic aneurysms varied with different positions (ie,
thoracic or abdominal aorta), the degradation of elastin was their
common characteristics. In this background, it may be a strategy
for treating AAA by promoting SMCs secreting elastin and
inhibiting proteases meanwhile, including MMPs. In recent years,
it has been reported that BMSCs could inhibit inflammatory
cytokines and promote the survival of elastin in AAA, but so far
there is no report about whether ADSCs can promote the
synthesis and secretion of elastin in SMCs. In this experiment, we
co-cultured the AAA aortic wall with ADSCs or BMSCs in vitro,
then conducted frozen sections and stained with orcein, and found
that elastic plate recovered to winding shape again, which was
similar to that of normal arterial wall. This phenomenon
demonstrated that ADSCs and BMSCs were able to promote
the reconstruction of elastic plates. Then we detected the protein
expression by Western blot, found that elastin content in ADSCs

or BMSCs co-culture group was significant higher than that in
control group, and the former was higher that the latter. The
findings suggested that both ADSCs and BMSCs could promote
the reconstruction of the elastic plate. The in vivo result also
verified this conclusion. Therefore it indicated that ADSCs might
promote the secretion and synthesis elastin in SMCs, which was
likely to provide new ideas for treating AAA. But the related
mechanisms in this process are not very clear, which depends on
subsequent trials.
