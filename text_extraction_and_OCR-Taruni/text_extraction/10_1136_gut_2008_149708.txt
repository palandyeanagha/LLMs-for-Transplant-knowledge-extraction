ABSTRACT
Background: Transient elastography (TE) has received
increasing attention as a means to evaluate disease
progression in patients with chronic liver disease.
Aim: To assess the value of TE for predicting the stage of
fibrosis.
Methods: Liver biopsy and TE were performed in 150
consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C-related
hepatitis (92 men and 58 women, age 50.6 (SD
12.5) years on the same day. Necro-inflammatory activity
and the degree of steatosis at biopsy were also
evaluated.
Results: The areas under the curve for the prediction of
significant fibrosis (>F2), advanced fibrosis (>F3) or
cirrhosis were 0.91, 0.99 and 0.98, respectively.
Calculation of multilevel likelihood ratios showed that
values of TE ,6 or >12, ,9 or >12, and ,12 or >18,
clearly indicated the absence or presence of significant
fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis, respectively.
Intermediate values could not be reliably associated with
the absence or presence of the target condition. The
presence of inflammation significantly affected TE
measurements in patients who did not have cirrhosis
(p,0.0001), even after adjusting for the stage of fibrosis.
Importantly, TE measurements were not influenced by the
degree of steatosis.
Conclusions: TE is more suitable for the identification of
patients with advanced fibrosis than of those with
cirrhosis or significant fibrosis. In patients in whom
likelihood ratios are not optimal and do not provide a
reliable indication of the disease stage, liver biopsy should
be considered when clinically indicated. Necro-inflamma￾tory activity, but not steatosis, strongly and independently
influences TE measurement in patients who do not have
cirrhosis.
In recent years a major effort has been directed at
the identification of non-invasive methodologies
for the assessment of the fibrotic progression of
chronic liver diseases (CLDs) and for the long￾itudinal follow-up of patients, particularly follow￾ing treatment.
A non-invasive medical device based on transient
elastography (TE) (Fibroscan; Echosens, Paris,
France) has received increasing attention. This
system has been proposed for the measurement
of liver stiffness, considered as a direct consequence
of the fibrotic evolution of CLD. Accordingly,
several studies aimed at evaluating the clinical
usefulness and diagnostic accuracy of TE in
predicting the degree of liver fibrosis have been
published.1–10 Most of the published studies were
based either on retrospective analysis or inadequate
study designs, ie, liver biopsy not performed at the
same time of TE and/or with suboptimal sample
characteristics2358 or the inclusion of different
aetiological groups within the same analysis.6–10
Another problem emerging from the published
reports concerns the different spectrum of fibrosis
stages (‘‘spectrum bias’’; ie, over-representation of
extreme stages of fibrosis) that make some
assumptions unsuitable for clinical practice.3 8 10
Finally, it is increasingly evident that features of
CLD other than fibrosis, ie, inflammatory infiltra￾tion, tissue necrosis or oedema, influence TE.9–12
Regardless, a key feature of the studies published
so far is the dichotomisation of TE measurements
by cut-off values selected by binary measures like
sensitivity and specificity. However, it does not
seem sufficiently informative to discriminate the
optimal cut-off value in a wide range of TE values.
It is therefore clinically relevant to pursue a more
efficient approach that allows the exploration of
the whole spectrum of TE measurements, such as
the analysis of multilevel likelihood ratios (LRs).13
The purpose of the present study was to further
assess the accuracy of TE in identifying hepatitis C
virus (HCV)-related CLD patients characterised by
significant (>F2) or advanced (>F3) fibrosis, or
cirrhosis (F4) by a multilevel LR analysis approach,
and to evaluate the possible interfering role of
inflammation and steatosis in a cohort of con￾secutive patients with HCV admitted to our centre
for the histopathological assessment of disease
progression.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Between 1 September 2006 and 1 July 2007, 161
consecutive patients with HCV-related CLD (92
men and 58 women, age 50.6 (SD 12.5), age range
21–70 years) were referred to Azienda Ospedaliero
Universitaria Careggi (AOUC) for the histopatho￾logical assessment of disease progression. On the
same day as the liver biopsy, patients underwent
an ultrasound examination of the complete upper
abdomen and measurement of TE. Inclusion
criteria were levels of serum alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT) .1.5-fold the upper normal limit,
either persistently or intermittently, and detectable
HCV RNA. Exclusion criteria were a body mass
index of 30 kg/m2 or greater, the presence of ascites
at clinical or ultrasound examinations, the presence
of hepatocellular carcinoma or previous/current
clinical decompensation of the disease, co-infection
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
hepatitis B virus (HBV), the use of intravenous
drugs, previous or current alcohol abuse or the
use of hepatotoxic drugs, genetic liver disease,

Laboratory tests, including serum bilirubin, albumin levels,
ALT levels, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (c-GT) levels, inter￾national normalised ratio (INR), platelet count, and creatinine
levels were determined in all patients at the time of hospital
admission. In each patient, liver biopsy and liver stiffness
measurement (LSM) were performed on the same day. The
nature of the study was explained to the patients, who provided
a priori written informed consent before the beginning of the
study, in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki (Edinburgh revision, 2000).
Transient elastography
Following ultrasound examination, TE was performed by using
the FibroScan apparatus, which consists of a 3.5 MHz ultra￾sound transducer probe mounted on the axis of a vibrator. Mild
amplitude and low-frequency vibrations (50 Hz) are trans￾mitted to the liver tissue, inducing an elastic shear wave that
propagates through the underlying liver tissue. The velocity of
the wave is directly related to tissue stiffness. With the patient
lying in dorsal decubitus with the right arm in the maximal
abduction, ultrasound previously identified an adequate section
of liver tissue free of large vascular structures and gallbladder in
the intercostal space on the right lobe, and a skin mark was
made to guide the position of TE transducer. The tip of the
FibroScan transducer was covered with a drop of gel and placed
perpendicularly in the intercostal space. Moreover, under
control time motion and A-mode the operator checked the
correct position of the probe during TE examination.3 5 Stiffness
was measured on a cylinder of hepatic tissue of 1 cm in
diameter and 2–4 cm in length. The operator was a staff
physician (AU) who had previously performed at least 100
determinations in patients with CLD. As previously described5
and as suggested by the provider of the instrumentation, we
considered representative measurements of the median value of

and with an interquartile range (IQR) over a median ratio lower
than 30%.
Ultrasound-assisted liver biopsy
The clinical indication for biopsy was either to assess the
evolution of a pre-diagnosed HCV-related liver disease, to
confirm the nature of a suspected liver disease, or preliminary to
a therapy with antiviral agents. Liver biopsy was performed on
the right lobe of the liver with a 16 G semiautomatic modified
Menghini needle system (BIOMOL; Hospital Service, Aprilia,
Italy) under local anaesthesia and ultrasound guidance. Thirty
minutes before the procedure, and after an overnight fast,
patients received 5 mg of diazepam and 5 mg of atropine. Liver
specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for
histological evaluation. Sections of liver tissue, 5 mm thick,
were stained with haematoxylin & eosin and Masson
trichrome, and were examined by an experienced pathologist.
The length of each liver specimen (in millimetres) was recorded.
Only samples with a length >25 mm and including at least 11
complete portal tracts14 were considered adequate for the
purpose of the study. Histological diagnoses were established
according to internationally accepted criteria.15 16 Fibrosis (F)
was staged on a five-point scale according to METAVIR: F0, no
fibrosis; F1, portal fibrosis without septa; F2, portal fibrosis
with few septa; F3, numerous septa without cirrhosis; and F4,
cirrhosis. Necro-inflammatory activity (A) was also graded on a
four-point scale according to METAVIR: A0, none; A1, mild;
A2, moderate; and A3, severe. Steatosis in liver specimens
was arbitrarily graded on a four-point scale: 0, ,5%; 1, 5–24%;
2, 25–49%; and 3, >50% of hepatocytes with fat deposits.
Statistical analysis
The comparison between clinical and laboratory variables and
TE values between fibrosis stages was conducted with ANOVA.
Bonferroni analysis was used for post-hoc comparisons. The
discriminative ability of TE to predict fibrosis >F2, >F3 or
cirrhosis (F4) was assessed by receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis. Multilevel LRs were used to explore the
relationship between stiffness and fibrosis stage across the
whole spectrum of TE values. The advantage of this approach is
that, unlike sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive values, computation of LRs does not require
dichotomisation of test results, which may discard useful
diagnostic information. The likelihood ratio for each category
was calculated by dividing the percentage of patients with the
target condition (>F2, >F3 or F4) in that category by the
percentage without the condition in that category. Ninety per
cent confidence intervals17 were calculated with the CIA
software (Version 2.1.2). LRs above 10 and below 0.1 are
considered to provide strong evidence to rule in or rule out
diagnoses, respectively.13 18 The ability of clinical and laboratory
variables to influence the diagnostic value of TE was assessed
with multivariable logistic regression analysis. The relation
between inflammation or steatosis and TE was adjusted by
fibrosis stage in a multivariable linear regression analysis. All
reported p values are two-sided. Only p values (0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was
performed with the SPSS 15.0 package.
RESULTS
Characteristics of patients
One hundred and fifty patients fulfilled the histopathological
requirements and were considered for the statistical analysis
(93%). Eleven patients were excluded from the study because
the liver biopsy length was ,25 mm and/or included fewer
than 11 complete portal tracts. The major clinical and
biochemical parameters of the patients included in the analysis
are listed in table 1. Histopathological findings are reported in
table 2. As shown in this table, the spectrum of fibrosis stages

was homogeneously represented in our study population. The
length of liver specimens was, on average, 33 (SD 0.7) mm, and
included 15 (SD 3) complete portal tracts. All histological
sections were considered adequate for evaluation with the
METAVIR scoring system by the pathologist. Among patients
with cirrhosis, endoscopy showed oesophageal varices in seven
(24%) and moderate portal hypertensive gastropathy in two
(7%). At the time of the study no patient with cirrhosis had
previous or current clinical and/or ultrasonographic signs of
clinical decompensation (ascites, encephalopathy, gastrointest￾inal bleeding, peripheral oedema). The mean duration of TE was
5 (SD 1.8) min. The mean number of measurements per patient
was 12 (SD 1). The mean success rate and the mean IQR of TE
measurements were 97.5% and 1.2 kPa, respectively. Figure 1
shows TE values for each stage of fibrosis.
Accuracy of transient elastography for prediction of significant
fibrosis (>F2)
Figure 2 (dotted line) shows the accuracy of TE for the diagnosis
of >F2 fibrosis. The data-driven best cut-off for the diagnosis of
significant fibrosis was 7.8 kPa (table 3). Multilevel LRs (table 4)
show that only values lower than 6 kPa or equal to or greater
than 12 kPa were adequate to rule out or rule in significant
fibrosis, respectively. Values between 6 and 12 kPa could not
reliably predict the presence or absence of significant fibrosis.
None of the clinical or analytical variables considered was able
to increase the predictive value of TE.
Accuracy of transient elastography for prediction of advanced
fibrosis (>F3)
The accuracy of TE for the diagnosis of >F3 fibrosis is
illustrated in fig 2 (continuous line). The data-driven best cut￾off for the diagnosis advanced fibrosis was 10.8 kPa (table 3). TE
values lower than 9 kPa or equal to or greater than 12 kPa were
adequate to rule out or rule in advanced fibrosis, respectively, as
indicated by multilevel LRs (table 4). Multilevel LRs analysis
show that values between 9 and 12 kPa could not reliably
predict the presence or absence of advanced fibrosis. None of the
clinical or analytical variables considered was able to increase
the predictive value of TE.
Accuracy of transient elastography for prediction of cirrhosis
(F4)
Figure 2 (dashed line) shows the accuracy of TE for the
diagnosis of cirrhosis. The data-driven best cut-off for the
diagnosis cirrhosis was 14.8 kPa (table 3). Multilevel LRs
(table 4) show that values of less than 12 kPa or equal to or
greater than 18 kPa were adequate to rule out or rule in
cirrhosis, respectively. Values between 12 and 18 kPa could not
reliably predict the presence or absence of cirrhosis at multilevel
LRs analysis. Among other clinical analytical variables, only
platelet count marginally (although significantly) increased the
predictive accuracy of TE for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. The area
under the ROC (AUROC) curve for the model with TE and
platelets was 0.98 (90% CI, 0.97 to 0.99, ROC curve not shown).
Relationship between necro-inflammatory activity and liver
stiffness
Necro-inflammatory activity at biopsy increased liver stiffness
in each fibrosis stage, except for F4 patients (fig 3). On average,
within each fibrosis stage in patients without cirrhosis but with
A2–A3 had a liver stiffness 1.7 kPa greater than patients with
A1 (90% CI, 0.971 to 2.460; p = 0.0004) and 2.4 kPa greater than
patients with A0 (90% CI, 1.396 to 3.463; p = 0.0003). The
degree of inflammation at biopsy could not be predicted from
ALT levels. Unlike necro-inflammatory activity, regression
analysis showed that ALT levels were not associated with
stiffness.
Relationship between steatosis and liver stiffness
The degree of steatosis at biopsy did not influence TE
measurements, even after adjusting for fibrosis stage
(p = 0.35) (fig 4).
Complication related to the procedures
No major complications were associated with percutaneous
liver biopsy. Fifteen patients (10%) experienced a self-limiting
abdominal and/or right shoulder pain, and six patients (4%)
required a single dose of intravenous analgesic drug (tramadol).
There were no complications associated with TE.

DISCUSSION
In recent years much attention has been focused on whether
non-invasive methodologies can detect significant or advanced
liver fibrosis. At their present stage of development, all non￾invasive methodologies have been shown to be effective in
predicting the presence of either no or minimal disease or
advanced disease, rather than being able to precisely assess the
progression of fibrosis in a step-wise fashion.19 However, all the
proposed approaches, used singly or in combination, are likely
to provide a significant contribution to the diagnostic manage￾ment of patients with CLD. TE is a promising clinical
methodology for the rapid and non-invasive assessment of
disease progression in viral and non-viral CLD, which is
currently subjected to extensive validation. In this context,
and based on the evidence reported so far, the present study was
performed in order to provide a more definite indication of the
real clinical utility of this methodology by employing a more
rigorous study design, particularly concerning the use of liver
biopsy as the reference standard,14 and a more informative
statistical analysis of the data.13
The results of the present study indicate that, although TE is
able to separate F3 and F4 from other stages of fibrosis, an
important overlap is observed among patients with lower
degrees of liver fibrosis (F0, F1 and F2). In addition, while TE
mean values of patients with stages F3 and F4 were significantly
different at Bonferroni analysis, an important overlap of TE
values was also observed between these advanced stages of
fibrosis. However, data reported in table 3 indicate that TE
reliably predicts the presence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
To overcome the limitations emerging from the use of single
cut-off values in clinical practice and to explore the whole
spectrum of TE measurements, the analysis of multilevel LRs was
introduced in order to estimate the likelihood of having a target
degree of fibrosis according to TE measurements. Indeed, the use
of multilevel LRs analysis is a more informative and correct
approach since it explores the whole spectrum of TE measure￾ment.13 18 In the present study, TE values ,6, ,9 and ,12 kPa
strongly predict the absence of significant or advanced fibrosis and
cirrhosis, respectively, whereas TE values >12 and >18 kPa
strongly predict the presence of significant or advanced fibrosis
and cirrhosis, respectively. The relative intermediate values do not
appear adequate to rule out or to rule in the stage of fibrosis. Of
note, no clinical or analytical variable considered in the present
study concretely contributed to the predictive value of TE.
The high TE value (>18 kPa) requested to predict the presence
of cirrhosis with an elevated level of confidence is likely due to the
significant overlap existing between TE values obtained in F3 and
F4 stages and to the difficulty of defining an appropriate level of
fibrosis evolution beyond the F4 stage. These interpretative
problems occur also when considering single cut-off values as
reflected by the wide range of the reported TE values predicting
the presence of cirrhosis (from 12.5 to 17.6 kPa).5 6 Accordingly,
TE appears to be a methodology more suitable for predicting
advanced fibrosis (ie, >F3) rather than cirrhosis.

METAVIR scoring system) is provided. Liver stiffness values are reported on the y-axis, in kilopascals, and necro-inflammatory activity on the x-axis
according to the METAVIR scoring system. The top and bottom of each box are first and second quartiles, respectively. The length of a box thus
represents the interquartile range within which 50% of the values are located. The line through each box represents the median. Error bars show
minimum and maximum non-extreme values. F, fibrosis (METAVIR stage). N, extreme values.
Figure 4 Box plots of transient elastography values in relation to the degree of steatosis. One graph for each degree of fibrosis (F, METAVIR scoring

(0, ,5%; 1, 5–24%; 2, 25–49%; and 3, >50% of hepatocytes with fat deposits). The top and bottom of each box are first and second quartiles,
respectively. The length of a box thus represents the interquartile range within which 50% of the values are located. The line through each box

An interesting finding of the present study is the demonstra￾tion that necro-inflammatory activity at biopsy influences TE
values. Indeed, necro-inflammatory activity increases liver
stiffness even after adjusting for fibrosis stage in patients who
do not have cirrhosis. On average, within each fibrosis stage,
patients without cirrhosis but with A2–A3 had a liver stiffness
1.7 kPa greater than patients with A1, and 2.4 kPa greater than
patients with A0. These results confirm reports from literature
suggesting the impact of necro-inflammatory activity on TE
during aminotransferase flares,9 acute viral hepatitis,11 12 in
patients with miscellaneous CLD,10 and in patients who have
received a liver transplant and who have recurrent hepatitis C.20
Therefore, the degree of necro-inflammatory activity may limit
the diagnostic accuracy of TE especially in patients with lower–
intermediate stages of fibrosis. This may account, at least in
part, for the range of uncertainty observed in the multilevel LR
analysis shown in table 4. As is evident, the high TE value
emerging from the LR analysis for the prediction of significant
fibrosis (>F2), ie, >12 kPa, is identical to the value required for
the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (>F3). As a result, it seems
reasonable to consider cautiously the TE values obtained in
patients with aminotransferase flares or unstable biochemical
activity. It is of note that in our study population the degree of
inflammation at biopsy could be not predicted from ALT levels.
Moreover, ALT levels were not associated with liver stiffness.
Therefore, the influence of inflammation on stiffness could not
be factorised by using ALT. These findings are in contrast with
those of Coco et al,9 who reported an association between TE
values and ALT levels. Of note, the cohort of patients
investigated by these authors was not homogeneous in terms
of aetiology, and patients with aminotransferases flares were
included. Furthermore, in the study by Coco et al the relation￾ship between necro-inflammation at histology, biochemical
activity and TE values was prejudiced, at least in part, by the
fact that biopsy was not simultaneously performed with TE.
This study also provides evidence on the possible interfering
role of steatosis on TE measurements. In our study population
the extent of steatosis at biopsy did not influence TE within
each fibrosis stage. These results are consistent with those of
Sandrin et al2 obtained in a smaller cohort of patients with HCV
in whom liver biopsy was not performed simultaneously with
TE, with the study by Ziol et al3 in which TE was performed
within 6 months after liver biopsy, and with those by Kim et al21
attained in healthy potential liver donors in whom TE values
were not correlated with steatosis. It must be pointed out that
only a minority of patients had massive steatosis (eight patients
with >50% of fatty hepatocytes) in our cohort. However, as
recently reported by Yoneda et al22 the extent of steatosis does
not seem to affect TE even in a cohort of patients with non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease.
In summary, TE is more suitable for the identification of
patients with advanced fibrosis rather than those with
significant fibrosis or cirrhosis. In patients in whom LRs are
not optimal for providing a reliable indication of the disease
stage, liver biopsy should be considered when clinically
indicated. Necro-inflammatory activity, but not steatosis,
strongly and independently influences TE measurement in
patients who do not have cirrhosis.
