Abstract. L‑carnitine administration was reported to improve 
sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. However, the amount of 
evidence from previous studies is not sufficient. The present 
study aimed to clarify the effect of levocarnitine (L‑carnitine) 
administration on body composition in patients with chronic 
liver disease (CLD). In the present study, 85 patients with 
L‑carnitine administration and 87 control patients were 
enrolled and divided them into two groups, the L‑carnitine 
administration group (LAG, n=44) and the without L‑carnitine 
administration (controls, n=44) group, by using propensity 
score matching for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and 
serum albumin. Δ skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)/year, 
Δ intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC)/year and 
Δ bone mineral density (BMD)/year were examined during 
L‑carnitine administration. Each parameter was measured by 
computed tomography (CT) or dual‑energy X‑ray absorptiom‑
etry. The median age overall was 69 years (IQR, 64.0, 75.0); 
36 were men and 52 were women. The median SMI was 
37.4 cm2
/m2
 (IQR, 34.01, 44.34). The initial CT scans 
showed similar median values of SMI for the two groups 
[37.74 (34.17, 43.58) and 37.16 (33.83, 44.34), P=0.67]. 
However, the median ΔSMI/year for the LAG and controls 
were 0.95% (‑3.07, 6.10) and ‑2.34% (‑5.34, 0.53), respectively 
(P=0.003). The median Δ whole body BMD/year for the LAG 
and controls were ‑0.24% (‑1.20, 0.91) and ‑1.04% (‑2.16, 0.47), 
respectively (P=0.038). The median ΔIMAC/year and 
Δ lumbar spine BMD were not significantly different between 
the LAG and controls. L‑carnitine administration may prevent 
the loss of skeletal muscle mass and BMD; therefore, it may be 
used as a new treatment option for osteoporosis and sarcopenia 
in patients with CLD.
Introduction
Sarcopenia is defined as a decrease in muscle strength and 
physical function and skeletal muscle mass depletion (1,2). 
Primary sarcopenia is caused by aging; secondary sarcopenia 
is caused by malnutrition, sedentary behavior, and various 
clinical conditions, such as inflammatory disease, endocrine 
disease, and liver disease (3,4). The prevalence of sarco‑
penia in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is ranged 
from 10 to 70% in Japan (4,5). Recent studies have revealed that 
sarcopenia exacerbates survival, quality of life, and outcome 
after liver transplant in patients with liver cirrhosis(LC) (6‑12). 
Since hepatocytes perform the function of glucose, lipid, 
and protein metabolism, liver dysfunction causes a glycogen 
storage dysfunction in the liver that facilitates the utilization 
of glycogen and branched amino acid from skeletal muscle, 
resulting in the progression of proteolysis (13,14). Therefore, 
preventive treatment is needed to reduce the onset and progres‑
sion of sarcopenia due to skeletal muscle depletion in patients 
with CLD.
Levocarnitine (L‑carnitine) is an essential nutrient that 
plays a pivotal role in fatty acid metabolism (15). L‑carnitine 
is involved in β‑oxidation of fatty acids. It is a conditionally 
synthesized nutrient from amino acids methionine and lysine in 
the brain, liver, and kidney. Carnitine is obtained mainly from 
food; however, one‑fourth of carnitine is synthesized in the 
kidney and liver (14,16). In other words, L‑carnitine deficiency 
occurs more frequently in patients with LC or CLD. Several 
reports about L‑carnitine administration in patients with LC 
revealed that it improved muscle cramps, suppressed hepatic

encephalopathy, and improved hyperammonemia (17,18). 
Furthermore, L‑carnitine administration may improve sarco‑
penia in patients with LC (14,19). However, enough evidence 
has not been obtained in previous studies. Thus, this study 
aimed to clarify the effect of L‑carnitine administration on 
body composition [skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral 
density (BMD)] in patients with CLD.
Materials and methods
Study design and patients. In this retrospective study, we 
reviewed 592 patients with CLD between 2015 and 2018 at 
Saiseikai Niigata Hospital. Of those patients, 85 were treated 
with L‑carnitine (Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) 
and underwent computed tomography (CT) twice during 
L‑carnitine administration. The interval of CT scans was 
within 6‑18 months. These 85 patients met the following inclu‑
sion criteria: i) Subsequent CT scans were conducted within 
6‑18 months that enabled evaluation of the change in skeletal 
muscle mass and clinical parameters and BMD by dual energy 
X‑ray; and ii) they continued L‑carnitine administration 
during the observational period. Patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) were excluded (Fig. 1). In this study, the 
L‑carnitine dose ranged from 1,500 to 3,000 mg/day, and the 
dose was selected by the attending physician. The reasons 
for L‑carnitine administration were hepatic encephalopathy, 
muscle cramps, hyperammonemia, hypoalbuminemia, or 
combination of these conditions. We evaluated the effects 
of L‑carnitine on body composition in patients with CLD. 
Moreover, 87 patients with CLD who did not receive L‑carnitine 
and underwent paired CT scans to screen for HCC within 
6‑18 months were enrolled as controls. Cases (patients who 
received L‑carnitine) and controls were matched for age, sex, 
body mass index (BMI), and serum albumin, using propensity 
score matching.
Evaluation for skeletal muscle mass and intramuscular 
adipose tissue content (IMAC). Skeletal muscle mass was 
evaluated using the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) on 
CT scans. The SMI was calculated as follows: The sum 
of the cross‑sectional area of skeletal muscles at the level 
of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was measured by a 
radiological technologist using a region of interest (ROI) 
precisely traced with the use of commercially available 
image analysis software (volume analyzer SYNAPSE 
VINCENT, Fujifilm Medical Co., Ltd.), and this value was 
divided by height squared (cm2
/m2
) (4). To evaluate the 
yearly change in SMI, ΔSMI/year (%) was calculated as 
follows: ΔSMI/year (%) = [(SMI on the second CT‑SMI on 
the initial CT)/SMI on the initial CT x100/interval between 
CT (day)/365] (19). CT was typically conducted in patients 
with CLD every 6‑12 months according to the guidelines of 
the Japan Society of Hepatology (20).
Muscle quality was examined as IMAC at the L3 
level. As previously described, IMAC was calculated by 
dividing the CT attenuation value of the multifidus muscles 
by that of the subcutaneous fat (21). To evaluate the yearly 
change in IMAC, ΔIMAC/year was calculated as follows: 
ΔIMAC/year = [IMAC on the second CT‑IMAC on the initial 
CT]/[interval between CT (day)/365].
Evaluation of BMD. All patients underwent scanning of 
the total lumbar spine (L2‑L4) BMD (LSBMD), and whole 
body BMD (WBBMD) by dual energy X‑ray absorptiom‑
etry (DEXA) at each CT. To evaluate the yearly change 
in both BMD, ΔBMD/year (%) was calculated as follows: 
ΔBMD/year (%) = [(BMD on the second DEXA‑BMD on 
the initial DEXA)/BMD on the initial DEXA x100/interval 
between DEXA (day)/365].
Clinical and laboratory assessment. Patients underwent 
blood tests and CT on the same day. Clinical data were 
collected for the etiology of liver disease, BMI, and 
blood test results (white blood cells, platelet counts (Plt), 
serum albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholinesterase, and 
hemoglobin A1c). The albumin‑bilirubin (ALBI) score in 
each participant was calculated by the following formula 
as reported previously: ALBI score = [log10 total bili‑
rubin (µmol/l) x 0.66] + [serum albumin (g/l) x ‑0.085], 
while ALBI grade was classified into the following: ALBI 
score ≤‑2.60, grade 1; ‑2.60 <ALBI score ≤‑1.39, grade 2; 
and ALBI score >‑1.39, grade 3 (22,23). The fibrosis‑4 
index (FIB‑4) in each participant was calculated by the 
following formula as reported previously: FIB‑4 = age 
(years) x AST (IU/l) ÷ [platelets (109) x ALT (IU/l)] (24‑26).
Statistical analysis. Continuous variables are presented as 
median and interquartile range (IQR) and analyzed using 
the Mann‑Whitney U test. Categorical variables and nominal 
variables are presented as frequency (percentage) and 
analyzed using Fisher's exact test. We applied 1:1 propensity 
score matching to balance the assignment of patients with 
L‑carnitine administration. The variables were age, sex, BMI, 
and serum albumin. Variables that affect sarcopenia were 
selected. Clinical features of CLD patients with sarcopenia 
were elderly, low BMI, and low albumin, and SMI depended 
on sex (27). Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. All statistical analyses were performed using 
EZR ver. 1.37 (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical 
University, Saitama, Japan) (28).
Results
Patient characteristics and body composition at baseline and 
endpoint. We enrolled 85 patients with L‑carnitine adminis‑
tration and 87 control patients in this study and divided these 
patients into two groups, namely, patients with L‑carnitine 
administration (LAG, n=44) and patients without L‑carnitine 
administration (controls, n=44), by using propensity score 
matching for age, sex, BMI, and serum albumin. The overall 
characteristics (32 men and 56 women) are shown in Table I. 
The median age was 69 years (IQR, 64.0, 75.0). The median 
SMI was 37.4 cm2
/m2
 (IQR, 34.01, 44.34). The etiology of CLD 
was hepatitis B virus infection (n=10), hepatitis C virus infec‑
tion (n=35), alcoholism (n=8), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n=23), primary biliary chol‑
angitis (n=5), autoimmune hepatitis (n=5), and others (n=2). 
No significant difference in variables were found between 
the LAG and controls at baseline as well as at the endpoint 
(Table II).

Comparison of change in SMI and body composition between 
the LAG and controls. The initial CT showed similar median 
values of SMI for the two groups [37.74 (34.17, 43.58) and 
37.16 (33.83, 44.34), P=0.67]. However, the median ΔSMI/year 
for the LAG and controls were 0.95% (‑3.07, 6.10) and ‑2.34% 
(‑5.34, 0.53), respectively (P<0.01) (Fig. 2A). The median 
ΔIMAC/year for the LAG and controls were ‑0.00 (‑0.03, 0.03) 
and 0.01 (‑0.02, 0.04), respectively (P=0.46) (Fig. 2B). The 
median ΔWBBMD/year for the LAG and controls were 
‑0.24% (‑1.20, 0.91) and ‑1.04% (‑2.16, 0.47), respectively 
(P=0.04) (Fig. 2C). The median ΔLSBMD/year for the LAG 
and controls were ‑0.67% (‑2.87, 1.80) and ‑0.18% (‑1.99, 2.99), 
respectively (P=0.18) (Fig. 2D).
Discussion
Our results revealed that L‑carnitine administration prevents 
skeletal muscle mass loss and osteoporosis. To our knowledge, 
this study is the first to report that L‑carnitine may improve 
both sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Thus, the results of this 
study are of clinical significance for patients with CLD who 
have sarcopenia and osteoporosis.
The median ΔSMI/year in our results was 0.69% for all 
patients, 0.95% for the LAG and ‑2.34% for the controls. 
Especially, the median ΔSMI/year of the LAG was significantly 
better than that of the controls. According to previous studies, 
ΔSMI/year or Δ skeletal muscle area/year of patients with LC 
ranged from ‑2.2 to ‑0.22% (19,29). Our results show that 
skeletal muscle loss is suppressed compared with the results of 
these reports. In Japan, L‑carnitine has been administered as a 
treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, hypoalbuminemia, and 
muscle cramps in patients with LC (17,18). Our study includes 
patients with CLD who take L‑carnitine for various purposes. 
However, the skeletal muscle mass of the LAG was signifi‑
cantly increased, suggesting that L‑carnitine may prevent 
skeletal muscle mass loss.
There are multiple hypotheses that carnitine administration 
suppresses skeletal muscle loss in patients with LC. Carnitine 
plays a central role in transporting long‑chain fatty acids from 
the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. Carnitine binds to the 
long‑chain acyl coenzyme A and is converted to acylcarnitine. 
Acylcarnitine is transported to the mitochondria and degraded 
by β‑oxidation (14,30). Thus, carnitine administration improves 
energy metabolism disorders in the mitochondria in the 
liver (31). Improvement of these energy metabolism disorders 
is considered to suppress hyperammonemia in patients with 
LC (32). This is because the urea cycle, particularly localized 
in the liver, is a metabolic system that requires a lot of energy. 
Hyperammonemia activates myostatin and decreases muscle 
protein synthesis (33). Therefore, preventing hyperammonemia 
prevents skeletal muscle loss. Hiramatsu et al (19) reported that 
L‑carnitine administration may suppress the progression of 
sarcopenia in conjunction with the improvement of hyperam‑
monemia. The required dose of carnitine expected to inhibit 
Figure 1. Patient flow chart. After screening 592 patients with chronic liver disease, 85 patients who were administered L‑carnitine and 87 who were not 
administered L‑carnitine were enrolled. After propensity score matching, 44 patients with L‑carnitine administration were selected and 44 patients without 
L‑carnitine administration were selected.

the progression of sarcopenia is ≥1,274 mg/day (19), and the 
carnitine dose administered in this study (1,500‑3,000 mg/day) 
exceeded that. However, since this is a retrospective study, 
serum ammonia was not measured in many cases. Prospective 
studies are needed to clarify the relationship between formed 
ammonia levels and skeletal muscle mass.
To date, carnitine administration has been suggested to 
increase lipid utilization in the skeletal muscle during low exercise 
and improve exercise performance (34). We considered that carni‑
tine not only increased skeletal muscle mass but also improved 
the quality and examined changes in IMAC, the quality indicator 
of skeletal muscle (21), but did not yield significant results in our 
study. Studies reported that fatty infiltration of the muscle (myos‑
teatosis) exacerbates hepatic encephalopathy in LC (35) and is a 
prognostic factor for liver transplant patients (21,36). Therefore, 
there is a need for treatments that improve not only skeletal 
muscle mass but also muscle quality. However, since the exercise 
and activity levels are not managed in this study, the effect of 
carnitine on IMAC may be unclear. In the future, a combination 
of carnitine and exercise may improve skeletal muscle quality.

6 OHASHI et al: LEVOCARNITINE EFFICACY IN PATIENTS WITH CLD
Furthermore, our study suggested that carnitine adminis‑
tration may prevent BMD loss. The prevalence of osteoporosis 
in patients with LC cirrhosis is ~12‑55%, which is higher 
than in healthy individuals (37). Along with sarcopenia, it is 
one of the issues that have a major influence on the health of 
patients with CLD. One of the mechanisms of osteoporosis 
in patients with CLD has been shown to activate osteoclasts 
by inflammatory cytokines (38). Because carnitine suppresses 
the production of inflammatory cytokines (39), it may have 
prevented the decrease in ΔWBBMD in our study. However, 
ΔLSBMD showed no significant effect. Further research is 
needed to treat osteoporosis in patients with CLD.
This study had several limitations. First, this was a 
retrospective single‑center study with a small sample size. 
Moreover, the observation period was different for each 
patient. Second, the purpose and dose of L‑carnitine admin‑
istration were decided by the attending physician. Thus, 
prospective studies are warranted to clarify the effects of 
L‑carnitine on preventing skeletal muscle loss in patients with 
liver disease.
In conclusion, we showed that L‑carnitine administration 
prevented the loss of skeletal muscle mass and BMD in patients 
with CLD. L‑carnitine administration can be a new option for 
treating osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Further detailed studies 
are needed to confirm this possibility.
