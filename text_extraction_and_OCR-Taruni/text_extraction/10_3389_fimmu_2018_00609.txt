Testing for liver-related autoantibodies should be included in the workup of patients 
with hepatitis or cholestasis of unknown origin. Although most of these autoantibodies 
are not disease specific, their determination is a prerequisite to diagnose autoimmune 
hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and they are components of the 
diagnostic scoring system in these diseases. In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), on

INTRODUCTION
Testing for liver-related autoantibodies should be included in the workup of patients with hepatitis 
or cholestasis of unknown origin. Although most of these autoantibodies are not disease specific, 
their determination is a prerequisite to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary 
cholangitis (PBC), and they are components of the diagnostic scoring system in these diseases (1, 2) 
(Table 1). In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), on the other hand, autoantibodies are frequently 
present but play a minor role in establishing the diagnosis, which is based on cholangiography. In 
PSC, however, data on antibodies suggest a link between disease pathogenesis and the intestinal 
microbiota (3).

In Europe, screening for liver-related autoantibodies is 
traditionally conducted using indirect immunofluorescence 
testing (IFT) on rodent tissue slices (Table 2). Cutoff levels for 
titers included in diagnostic scores for AIH and PBC use IFT as a 
standard. In other parts of the world, solid-phase test systems are 
widely used and to date it is unclear, whether this results in altered 
sensitivity or specificity of the tests applied and how these findings 
can be translated into diagnostic scores. IFT has the advantage 
of not only assessing the titer of the autoantibodies but also the 
fluorescence pattern, which may provide additional information 
on the presence, e.g., of PBC-defining antinuclear antibodies 
(ANA). Therefore, fluorescence pattern of ANA should always 
be reported together with the antibody titer. It is important to 
note, however, that IFT is a subjective method that requires an 
experienced lab technician and that international standards for 
testing are currently lacking. Also, titers may differ between labs

due to different substrates used, and, therefore, the lab-specific 
reference values should be noted.
The following review will focus on practical aspects of anti￾body testing in the three major autoimmune liver diseases AIH, 
PBC, and PSC.
AUTOANTIBODIES IN AIH
Introduction
Diagnosis of AIH
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic inflammatory liver disease 
with unknown etiology (1, 4, 5). The diagnosis of AIH is based on 
a combination of typical findings, which are not disease specific 
and on the exclusion of other liver diseases, such as viral hepa￾titis (6–8). It is assumed that AIH is a T cell-mediated disease. 
However, there are hints at a relevant role for a humoral immune 
response in AIH pathogenesis: autoantibodies can frequently 
be detected, plasma cells are enriched in hepatic infiltrates and 
immunoglobulin G (IgG)/gammaglobulins serve as a diagnostic 
and disease activity markers. Nevertheless, the exact pathogenetic 
relevance of this humoral immune response for AIH is unclear 
and has not been investigated in detail (Table 1). The antigens 
that are targeted by autoantibodies in AIH have been identified 
in most cases. Still, it is uncertain whether these autoantigens play 
a relevant role for the induction or preservation of chronic liver 
inflammation in AIH.
The presence of AIH-related autoantibodies supports the 
diagnosis of AIH. However, most autoantibodies being associated 
with AIH have a relatively low disease specificity (Table 1). In 
the setting of acute or even chronic hepatitis of an etiology other 
than AIH, and even in healthy persons, liver autoantibodies can 
frequently be found. Besides, the presence of autoantibodies is 
not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of AIH: around 10–15% of 
patients present without known autoantibodies (“seronegative” 
AIH) or develop them during the course of disease after an acute 
onset.
Methods of Testing
As mentioned earlier, IFT on rodent kidney, liver, and stomach 
tissue and on HEp-2 cells is recommended as the standard method 
for the detection of liver autoantibodies (9). It is important to note 
that IFT testing is a subjective method and titers may vary depend￾ing on the laboratory performing the test. Antibody titers above 
1:40 have a higher specificity for AIH, but it is unknown whether 
very high titers (e.g., >1:640) are associated with an even higher 
specificity. IFT enables the simultaneous analysis of most of the 
antibodies that are relevant for autoimmune liver diseases. HEp-2 
cells with their prominent nuclei help to identify specific patterns 
of ANA. HEp-2 cells should not be used for initial screening for 
the presence of ANA since low titer antibodies can frequently be 
found in healthy subjects using these cells (10). Therefore, screen￾ing for ANA should be performed on rodent kidney, liver, and 
stomach tissue. In the case of positivity, the pattern of ANA should 
then be analysed on HEp-2 cells (9). The fluorescence pattern of 
ANA on HEp-2 cells provides additional diagnostic information: 
a pattern of multiple “nuclear dots” or a “nuclear rim” pattern 
suggest the presence of anti-sp100 or anti-gp210, respectively, 
and thereby hint at the diagnosis of PBC or a variant syndrome of 
AIH with features of PBC (see below section on autoantibodies in 
PBC). In Europe, there is consensus that solid-phase assays such 
as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or immuno￾blots should only be used to confirm the results of IFT, but not 
for initial screening of ANA. However, in the USA, ELISA are 
frequently used for screening purposes (4). For the diagnostic 
workup of autoimmune liver diseases, anti-soluble liver antigen/
liver–pancreas antibodies (anti-SLA/LP) should already initially 
be tested for by ELISA or immunoblot since these autoantibodies 
cannot be detected by IFT and have high specificity for AIH.
Subclassification of AIH According to Autoantibody 
Pattern
Next to their diagnostic value, certain autoantibodies have been 
associated with a different clinical presentation and prognosis of 
AIH. These associations have led to the classification of type 1 
and type 2 AIH. Type 1 AIH is the predominant type of AIH 
in adults and children and is defined by the presence of ANA 
and/or antismooth muscle antibodies (anti-SMA) (7). Anti-SMA 
(and especially anti-actin antibodies) have been associated with 
inflammatory activity of AIH in adult patients (11). However, 
these results still need to be validated. Type 2 AIH (about 5–10% 
of all AIH patients) is typically defined by anti-liver–kidney 
microsomal type 1 antibodies (anti-LKM-1) or, in rare cases, 
by anti-LKM-3 and/or anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibodies (anti￾LC1) (12–14). Type 2 AIH presents at a younger age, often in 
childhood, and is associated with a more aggressive disease 
course than type 1 AIH (12, 15). It is still controversial whether 
the presence of anti-SLA/LP defines a third subgroup of AIH 
(type 3 AIH) with a potentially more aggressive clinical course or 
whether anti-SLA/LP-positive AIH patients experience a clinical 
course similar to type 1 AIH patients (16–19). In 5–10% of AIH 
patients, anti-SLA/LP are present in combination with ANA and/
or anti-SMA. In up to 10% of AIH patients, anti-SLA/LP are the 
sole antibodies detected (20), a fact that mandates their testing 
for the diagnosis of AIH.
Special Considerations in Children
Antibody testing in pediatric patients demands special attention. 
Titers for most liver autoantibodies seem to correlate with age: in 

4
Sebode et al. Autoantibodies in Autoimmune Liver Disease
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 609
children, lower titers (1:20 for ANA and anti-SMA and 1:10 for 
anti-LKM-1) can be diagnostic for AIH, whereas in adults, higher 
titers of ANA (1:80–1:160) can also be found in healthy individu￾als (9, 21). Therefore, the physician should be informed by the 
laboratory on any antibody titer that is detected and interpret the 
results according to patient’s age.
Repeated Testing of Autoantibodies
Particularly in pediatric patients with autoimmune liver diseases, 
titers of liver-related autoantibodies can correlate with disease 
activity and response to treatment may be paralleled by reduction 
or even disappearance of antibody titers (21, 22). Thus, retesting 
of autoantibodies can be reasonable in children, as it can add 
information on the depth of remission achieved.
Retesting of autoantibodies for adult patients with AIH can￾not be recommended in general, but can be helpful in special 
clinical settings. In cases of acute hepatitis and initially negative 
autoimmune serology, antibody testing should be repeated after 
3–6 months since antibodies can appear during the course of dis￾ease. In adult patients, a variant syndrome of AIH with features of 
additional PBC can develop even several years after the diagnosis 
of classical AIH. Therefore, IFT should be repeated to screen 
for PBC-specific ANA or antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) 
whenever cholestatic liver enzymes remain or become elevated 
or when symptoms suggestive of PBC develop in an AIH patient. 
Currently, regular retesting of autoantibodies in adult patients as a 
surrogate marker for inflammatory activity is not recommended.
Antinuclear Antibodies
Antinuclear antibodies were the first autoantibodies to be associ￾ated with AIH (23). However, they lack disease specificity. About 
50–75% of AIH patients are ANA-positive (with or without 
anti-SMA) (24). ANA can also be detected in healthy persons or 
patients with other liver diseases such as fatty liver disease, drug￾induced liver injury (DILI) disease, or viral hepatitis. The pattern 
of ANA in AIH often is speckled or homogenous. It is uncertain 
whether a distinct pattern of ANA has a higher specificity for 
AIH. ANA in AIH are directed against several antigens such as 
chromatin, histones, centromere, double-(ds) and single-(ss) 
stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), cyclin A, ribonucleopro￾teins or other nuclear antigens that have not yet been identified 
(25–29). A biochemical differentiation of these antigens is not 
recommended because they have not been associated with a 
certain clinical course or a higher diagnostic specificity for AIH. 
It is important to acknowledge that up to 20% of AIH patients 
may display anti-dsDNA antibodies. This may cause confusion 
with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematodes, which has to 
be ruled out in patients with respective clinical findings. In rare 
cases, both diseases may occur together (30).
Antismooth Muscle Antibodies
Similar to ANA, anti-SMA have been associated with AIH since 
the early days of the clinical definition of AIH. They are also not 
disease specific and can be detected in various liver diseases such 
as fatty liver disease (31, 32). Anti-SMA are present in about 
50% of patients with type I AIH and can be the only detectable 
autoantibody. In IFT, anti-SMA react with the smooth muscles 
of the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae of the stomach or 
arterial walls of the liver. On kidney tissue, anti-SMA show differ￾ent staining patterns: the vascular/glomerular and the vascular/
glomerular/tubular (VGT) patterns are more specific for AIH 
than the vascular (V) pattern (9, 24). The VGT pattern can be 
confirmed by IFT performed on fibroblasts or vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSM47) (33). On a molecular level, anti-SMA are 
a heterogeneous group of antibodies showing reactivity against 
actin, tubulin or intermediate filaments (34). Sera showing the 
VGT pattern react in 80% with filamentous actin (F-actin) (9, 
33, 35). Actin is a ubiquitous contractile protein. The presence of 
anti-F-actin antibodies can be confirmed by solid-phase assays, 
such as ELISA (36). Anti-SMA showing reactivity against F-actin 
seem to be more specific for AIH, but can also be detected in 
other liver diseases (35, 37).
Anti-Liver–Kidney Microsomal Antibodies 
(Anti-LKM)
Anti-LKM-1, but also anti-LKM-3 are defining type 2 AIH (9). 
In IFT, anti-LKM stain, the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and the 
proximal, larger renal tubuli, but not parietal cells of the stomach 
(38). By contrast, AMA in PBC stain the mitochondria-rich, 
distal, smaller renal tubuli, and gastric parietal cells. ELISA 
tests are recommended to confirm positivity for anti-LKM in 
IFT (39). The autoantigen that is recognized by anti-LKM-1 in 
AIH is cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 (40–44). Anti-LKM-1 are 
not AIH-specific and can also be found in patients with chronic 
viral hepatitis C (HCV) (45, 46). However, the epitopes that are 
targeted by anti-LKM-1 in HCV-infected patients differ from 
those in patients with AIH (47, 48). Anti-LKM-2 have been 
detected in cases of tielinic acid-induced DILI, a drug that has 
been withdrawn from the market (49). In contrast to anti-LKM-1, 
anti-LKM-2 target a different isoform of the cytochrome P 450, 
namely CYP 2C9. Anti-LKM-3 can be found in few patients 
with AIH, but also in HCV and viral hepatitis D. They recognize 
members of the uridine glycuronosyl transferases family 1 (26, 
27, 50, 51).
Anti-Soluble Liver Antigen/Liver–Pancreas 
Antigen Antibodies (Anti-SLA/LP)
Anti-SLA/LP have the highest specificity for AIH among all 
AIH-related autoantibodies (9). However, they are present in only 
about 10–20% of patients. Due to their high specificity, anti-SLA/
LP should be tested routinely when AIH is suspected or in any 
case of unclear elevation of liver enzymes. Anti-SLA/LP cannot 
be detected by IFT and need to be tested for by ELISA or Western 
blot (52). The cytosolic autoantigen targeted by anti-SLA/LP was 
described independently by different groups and has been char￾acterized later on as O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteine-tRNA 
synthase (SepSecS), a synthase (S) converting O-phosphoseryl￾tRNA (Sep) to selenocysteinyl-tRNA (Sec) (20, 53–58). Anti￾SLA/LP belong to the IgG1 subtype of immunoglobulins and 
recognize an immunodominant epitope at the carboxy terminus 
of the SepSecS protein (59). Interestingly, the epitopes of SepSecS 
recognized by anti-SLA/LP-antibodies overlap with CD4+ T cell 
epitopes. This points to a relevant pathogenetic role of SepSecS 

5
Sebode et al. Autoantibodies in Autoimmune Liver Disease
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 609
for the subgroup of anti-SLA/LP-positive AIH patients (60). 
Anti-SLA/LP have been associated with the presence of a sub￾type of ANA (anti-Ro52) (61). Unexplained adverse pregnancy 
outcomes in AIH were highly associated with the presence 
anti-SLA/LP and anti-Ro52, potentially due to antibody-induced 
congenital heart block (62).
Other Antibodies Associated With AIH
Anti-Liver Cytosol Type 1 Antibodies (Anti-LC1)
Anti-LC1 antibodies directed against liver cytosol 1 (anti-LC1) 
target epitopes of the enzyme formiminotransferase cyclodeami￾nase (63). They are present in about 30% of type 2 AIH patients, 
alone or in combination with anti-LKM-1 (64, 65). In IFT, 
anti-LC1 stain hepatocytes but spare the centrilobular areas of 
the liver. By contrast, anti-LKM-1 stain hepatocytes throughout 
the liver lobule. When both antibodies are coexistent, anti￾LKM-1 cover the spared areas of anti-LC1. Thereby, anti-LKM-1 
can mask the presence of anti-LC1. Solid-phase assays help to 
identify anti-LC-1 (65). When anti-LC1 are the sole antibodies 
being detected, they strongly support the diagnosis of type 2 AIH. 
However, anti-LC1 are not AIH specific and can also be detected 
in patients with HCV (64).
Antineutrophil Cytoplasmatic Antibodies With a 
Perinuclear Staining Pattern (p-ANCA)
The presence of p-ANCA can support the diagnosis of AIH, 
especially in the absence of other autoantibodies (9). However, 
p-ANCA can also be detected in chronic viral hepatitis, inflam￾matory bowel disease (IBD), PSC or microscopic polyangiitis, 
and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (66–69). 
p-ANCA mainly react with myeloperoxidase. Atypical p-ANCA 
(p-ANNA), which are characterized by the retention of a peri￾nuclear staining on formaldehyde-fixed neutrophils seem to be 
more specific for autoimmune liver diseases and IBD (9).
Anti-Asialoglycoprotein Receptor Antibodies 
(Anti-ASGPR)
Anti-ASGPR can be detected in 24–82% of AIH patients, 
depending on the diagnostic assay used (70). Anti-ASGPR target 
a liver-specific membrane receptor and seem to correlate with 
histological activity (70). However, anti-ASGPR are not disease 
specific and are also present in patients with chronic viral hepa￾titis or PBC.
AMA in Patients With AIH
Since IFT on the abovementioned rodent tissues allows the simul￾taneous detection of autoantibodies for different autoimmune 
liver diseases, PBC-specific AMA are occasionally detected during 
the diagnostic workup for AIH. In this case, a variant syndrome 
of AIH with features of PBC should be suspected, often indicated 
by persistent elevation of cholestatic liver enzymes after the AIH 
component has reached remission. In some rare cases, AMA 
develop during the course of classical AIH with a novel elevation 
of cholestatic liver enzymes (2). In other rare instances, AMA 
can be detected in AIH patients without any other laboratory or 
histological signs of concomitant PBC. It is unclear whether this 
is an epiphenomenon, whether these cases represent a subform of 
AIH or a very early stage of an AIH variant syndrome with addi￾tional PBC (71, 72). Additional treatment with UDCA should be 
decided upon on an individual basis. In acute AIH, AMA may 
be present as an unspecific sign of acute liver damage, and they 
usually disappear over time (73).
Pathogenetic Role of Autoantibodies 
in AIH
It is unclear whether autoantibodies substantially contribute 
to the pathogenesis of AIH (Table  1). Most knowledge on a 
potential pathogenetic role of autoantibodies in AIH derives 
from analyzes of anti-LKM. The cross-reaction of anti-LKM 
with homologous regions of CYP 2D6 and HCV hints at a viral 
infection being a possible trigger for type 2 AIH. Molecular 
mimicry has been proposed for several autoimmune diseases. 
However, it has not been convincingly shown that an acute viral 
infection is truly the disease initiating event for a substantial 
number of AIH patients. For type 2 AIH patients, an abnormal 
expression of CYP 2D6 as the respective autoantigen of anti￾LKM has been detected on the surface of hepatocytes (74). It is 
unclear, how autoantibodies in other types of AIH are able to 
target intracellular antigens. The release of nuclear or cytosolic 
antigens due to hepatocyte damage has been proposed as one 
possible mechanism. Another area of uncertainty is the fact 
that almost all of the antigens addressed by antibodies in AIH 
are not exclusively expressed in the liver, such as CYP 2D6, 
which is also expressed, e.g., in the central nervous system. 
Also, the target antigen of anti-SLA/LP is expressed in liver, 
pancreas, lungs, kidneys, and activated lymphocytes, but 
anti-SLA/LP have only been associated with AIH (55, 57). 
Asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is a hepatic C-type lectin 
expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes physiologi￾cally and on the canalicular membrane of hepatocyctes under 
inflammatory conditions (70). A T  cell-mediated immune 
reaction, overlapping in its targeted epitopes with the humoral 
immune response, has been identified for ASGPR, for CYP 2D6 
(75, 76) and for SepSecS, the molecular target of anti-SLA/LP 
(60, 77).
AUTOANTIBODIES IN PBC
Introduction
Diagnosis of PBC
Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic non-suppurative granu￾lomatous inflammation of the small intrahepatic bile ducts (2). 
The first description of this disease dates back more than 100 years 
(78) and historically, PBC was often diagnosed only postmortem
(79). Around 90% of all affected patients are female, and the vast 
majority (>90%) display autoantibodies. Clinically, PBC leads 
to elevation of cholestatic parameters and often a selective IgM 
elevation. In addition, many patients will have elevated choles￾terol levels. Autoantibodies play a major role for the diagnosis 
of PBC: European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 
recommends that in adult patients with chronic cholestasis and 
no likelihood of systemic disease, a diagnosis of PBC can be made 
based on elevated ALP and the presence of AMA at a titer of more

than 1:40. In the absence of AMA, PBC-specific ANA can serve 
to diagnose the disease (2) (Table 1).
Autoantibodies in PBC
Autoantibodies, and especially AMA, are a hallmark of the dis￾ease: The first tests for detection of AMA were developed in the 
1960s (80) and facilitated diagnosis and timely treatment later on. 
The development not only of refined testing for AMA but also the 
addition of other PBC-defining autoantibodies to the repertoire 
has led to an increasing proportion of PBC patients displaying 
autoantibodies and likely also to earlier diagnosis. Today, even 
non-invasive testing for AMA seems feasible as a recently pub￾lished approach to test AMA in saliva has demonstrated (81). 
It remains unclear whether these autoantibodies are pathoge￾netically relevant. There has been some debate about AMA being 
responsible for fatigue in PBC and trials to evaluate the effect 
of an anti-CD20 treatment are on the way (82). In patients with 
suspected PBC and negative AMA-testing, PBC-defining ANA 
should be sought (Table 1).
In all patients with unexplained chronic cholestasis or sus￾pected PBC, autoantibody testing should be performed using IFT 
on rodent tissue and confirmation of fluorescence pattern using 
Hep-2 cells (see above) (2) Approximately 10% of PBC patients 
will not display AMA (2, 83). In these patients, diagnostic accuracy 
is improved by testing for PBC-specific nuclear autoantibodies, 
which will be present in approximately half of the AMA-negative 
patients (84). In addition, some of the nuclear antibodies have 
been associated with prognosis (see below); therefore, antibody 
pattern may in clinical practice help to risk stratify patients.
Antimitochondrial Antibodies
Antimitochondrial antibodies have initially been described in 
patients with PBC by Dame Sheila Sherlock (80). These antibod￾ies are directed against the pyruvate-dehydrogenase E2 (PDC￾E2) (85) subunit located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. 
In IFT, AMA lead to a typical cytoplasmic staining in rat liver 
and kidney slices, but they are often also visible on HEp-2 cells. 
The vast majority of PBC patients (exceeding 90%) (86) display 
these antibodies (87), and they may occasionally be found years 
preceding an elevation of liver enzymes (see below). Increasingly 
often, AMA are detected, e.g., due to rheumatological screens in 
patients with normal liver enzymes (88, 89), usually at lower titers 
than in patients with overt PBC (90). A considerable proportion 
of patients with positive AMA but no signs of PBC will likely 
develop symptomatic PBC at some time point and therefore these 
patients should be followed clinically and biochemically (91, 92). 
Current data and guidelines do not support treatment in AMA￾positive persons without any elevated liver enzymes or signs 
of PBC (2, 83). Several subtypes of AMA have been identified 
(traditionally named M1–M9). In this historical classification, 
antibodies directed against M2, M4, M8, and M9 are associated 
with PBC. Nowadays, combined peptides covering these anti￾genic regions have been constructed (93) and are widely used in 
confirmatory solid-phase tests.
Antimitochondrial antibodies can be comprised of IgG, IgA 
(94), and IgM antibodies (95) or a combination thereof, whereby 
AMA of the IgG3 subtype and IgA directed against PDC-E2 have 
been associated with more severe disease (96). In a subgroup of 
patients, AMA seem to be solely comprised of IgM antibodies 
(REF). To date, it is unclear, whether testing systems should 
include the possibility to detect IgM antibodies.
AMA on IFT may be confused with other cytoplasmatic 
antibodies (e.g., cardiolipin antibodies), therefore, it is advis￾able to perform a confirmatory test using one of the ELISA or 
Western blot test systems, which include several of the known 
PDC epitopes.
Primary biliary cholangitis-specific autoantibodies should be 
sought in patients with chronic (>6 months) elevation of chole￾static liver enzymes. Of note, patients with acute liver damage of 
any kind or liver failure may also display AMA (73). These usually 
disappear with the resolution of the acute disease.
Anti-sp100 Antibodies
In patients without AMA and persisting suspicion of PBC, ANA 
should be sought by using IFT in HEp-2 cells. These antibodies 
will be present in around 30–50% of AMA-negative PBC patients 
and interestingly, have been described to be inversely correlated 
to the development of fibrosis (97). These ANA have so far have 
not been associated with any specific disease features. They are 
moderately specific for PBC and can rarely be detected in rheu￾matological diseases and in acute hepatitis of any origin (33, 98, 
99). Anti-sp100 result in a typical pattern of “nuclear dots” in IFT 
on HEp-2-cells (100); a confirmatory test (ELISA and Western 
Blot) is available (101).
Anti-gp210 Antibodies and Anti-Lamin-B￾Receptor Antibodies
A subgroup of patients with PBC may display anti-gp210 or, 
rarely, anti-lamin-B-receptor antibodies in addition to AMA or 
even exclusively. Anti-gp210 (102) and anti-lamin-B-receptor 
(103) result in a “nuclear rim” pattern on IFT using HEp-2 
cells, where anti-lamin-B-receptor antibodies usually result 
in a smooth staining and the anti-gp210-antibody appears as 
discontinuous staining on IFT. For anti-gp210, a confirmatory 
test is widely available; confirmatory testing for anti-lamin-B￾receptor is subject to specialized laboratories. These antibodies 
are present in around 20% PBC patients, and in around 30–50% 
of AMA-negative patients and are considered specific for PBC. 
In addition, an unfavorable course of PBC has been associated 
with the presence of anti-gp210 in several studies (99, 104, 
105), and a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma has 
been reported in this patient cohort (106). Therefore, patients 
with these antibodies may warrant special attention in disease 
surveillance (83).
Anti-Centromere Antibodies
Anti-centromere have been described in patients with systemic 
sclerosis but may occasionally occur in PBC patients without fea￾tures of systemic sclerosis. Clinically, anti-centromere have been 
associated with increased portal hypertension in these patients 
(99) and a poor prognosis (107, 108). Anti-centromere have 
recently also been associated with the development of kidney 
disease in PBC patients (109).

Anti-Kelch-Like 12 Antibodies, 
Anti-Hexokinase1 Antibodies
Recently, two new autoantibodies, anti-Kelch-like 12 and anti￾hexokinase1 have been described in PBC (110). So far, no clear 
associations with disease activity or clinical course have been 
established, and their prevalence in larger populations has yet to 
be established.
Antibodies Found in Patients With PBC 
and Additional Signs of AIH
Features of AIH may be present in 10–20% of patients who pre￾sent with PBC. There are no generally accepted criteria to define 
these variant syndromes. In most patients, both diseases manifest 
simultaneously and in these patients, the Paris criteria have been 
established and endorsed by EASL to indicate additional AIH in 
a PBC patient (2, 111). AIH can be diagnosed if two of three cri￾teria are present: (1) elevation of ALT levels >5 times upper limit 
the normal (ULN), (2) elevation of serum IgG levels >2 times 
ULN or positive anti-SMA, and (3) moderate to severe interface 
hepatitis on histology. In addition, the presence of anti-SLA/LP 
and anti-dsDNA may raise the suspicion of AIH in patients with 
PBC (112–114).
AUTOANTIBODIES IN PSC
Introduction
Diagnosis of PSC
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a cholestatic liver disease of 
unknown origin that is characterized by progressive multifocal 
strictures of the extra- and/or intrahepatic bile ducts (115, 116). 
PSC is strongly associated with a unique phenotype of IBD, 
mostly presenting as a mild pancolitis (117). While the onset of 
PSC is often insidious, the natural course leads to liver cirrhosis, 
hepatobiliary malignancies, colon cancer, and episodes of super￾imposed bacterial cholangitis (118). This results in death or liver 
transplantation after a median time of approximately 15–20 years 
(119, 120). PSC is usually characterized by a cholestatic profile of 
liver enzymes with a leading elevation of alkaline phosphatase. 
The diagnosis is nowadays established by magnetic-resonance 
cholangiography, since invasive direct cholangiography using 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is associated 
with markedly more complications, although it may yield a 
slightly higher sensitivity with regard to small bile ducts and the 
extrahepatic duct (121). Liver biopsy is usually not required to 
establish the diagnosis (122), unless concurrent AIH or small￾duct PSC is suspected (123).
Autoantibodies in PSC
Although various serum antibodies have been described in 
patients with PSC, immune serology in PSC is generally con￾sidered unspecific and therefore of limited value to establish 
the diagnosis (124, 125) (Table  1). The most prevalent serum 
antibodies in PSC are p-ANCA, which can be found in up to 93% 
of patients, followed by ANA (8–77%) and anti-SMA (0–83%) 
(126). However, p-ANCA are also frequently found in patients 
with ulcerative colitis without PSC, in patients with AIH and to 
a lesser extent in PBC (127, 128). Due to the lack of specificity, 
p-ANCA can support the diagnosis of PSC only in selected 
patients, mainly those lacking associated IBD.
Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies 
With Perinuclear Staining Pattern 
(p-ANCA)
Usually, p-ANCA are demonstrated on IFT on alcohol-fixed 
human granulocytes. However, an experienced technician is 
required as evaluation of the staining patterns is challenging (129). 
The “atypical” pattern frequently found in sera of patients with 
PSC is characterized by broad inhomogeneous rim-like staining 
of the nuclear periphery and multiple intranuclear fluorescent 
foci. By contrast, “classical” p-ANCA with fine rim-like staining 
of the perinuclear cytoplasm are predominantly found in patients 
with microscopic polyangiitis (129).
The principal target antigen of p-ANCA is a matter of debate 
but is likely located within the cell nucleus rather than in the 
cytoplasm (130, 131). The most likely candidate antigen is beta￾tubulin isoform 5 (TBB-5) (132). Interestingly, p-ANCA cross￾react with FtsZ, which is considered an evolutionary ancestor of 
TBB-5 and is widely abundant in bacteria of the human intestine 
(132). This highlights that abnormal immune responses to com￾mensal bacteria might be implied in the pathogenesis of PSC.
Both cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) and p-ANCA were also 
found in bile fluid of patients with PSC and correlated with 
several adverse clinical outcomes, which might further underline 
their pathogenetic significance (133).
The presence of p-ANCA in serum has been associated 
with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with PSC (134). 
However, this notion has been challenged by other authors 
(135). Recently, p-ANCA have been linked to a distinct clinical 
phenotype of PSC with p-ANCA-positive patients being younger 
at disease-onset and at lower risk of cholangiocarcinoma (68). 
Moreover, the genotypes of p-ANCA-positive patients more often 
comprised the strong PSC-risk alleles HLA-B*08 and DRB1*03 
(68). In small-duct PSC, a more benign variant of “classical” PSC 
which presents with a normal cholangiogram, the prevalence, 
and clinical significance of p-ANCA is unclear (136).
Antibodies to Biliary Epithelial Cells (BEC)
Few studies found antibodies of different subtypes in sera of 
patients with PSC directed against BEC (137–140). Levels of IgA 
antibodies directed against BEC were correlated with adverse 
patient outcomes (140). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated 
that antibodies against BEC and bacterial lipopolysaccharides 
co-activate cytokine release by BEC and therefore induce biliary 
immune responses (139). This provides further evidence for the 
involvement of microbiota in the pathogenesis of PSC. Testing 
for anti-BEC antibodies has not been introduced into clinical 
practice.
Antibodies Found in Patients With PSC 
and Additional AIH
Additional features of AIH are found in approximately 5% of adult 
patients with PSC (141) but are prevalent in 35–65% of children

with PSC (142, 143). In children and adolescents, the primary 
manifestation of disease may be that of typical AIH, together with 
cholangiographic and histological changes of sclerosing cholangi￾tis (also called autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis) (142). Testing 
patients with PSC for ANA, anti-SMA using IFT and for anti￾SLA/LP using ELISA should be performed when additional AIH 
is suspected. Liver histology is mandatory to establish suspected 
AIH in patients with PSC, which will affect treatment decisions 
since AIH should be treated with immunosuppression (1, 125).
Antibodies Against Glycoprotein 2 (Anti-GP2)
Recently, IgA-class antibodies against glycoprotein 2 (anti-GP2 
IgA), which were formerly linked to severe types of Crohn’s disease 
(144), were detected in sera of patients with PSC at a prevalence 
of 46.7–71.5%. The presence of anti-GP2 IgA was strongly associ￾ated with large bile-duct involvement, development of cholan￾giocarcinoma, and increased mortality (3). Therefore, anti-GP2 
might serve as a novel biomarker of risk stratification in patients 
with PSC. Moreover, evidence for the involvement of GP2 in 
immune responses of the intestinal mucosa to gut bacteria (145, 
146) provides a further pathophysiological link to the recently 
discovered aberrant community structure of the gut microbiota 
in patients with PSC (147–149).
Other Antibodies: IgG4
IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC) can display a cholangiographi￾cal pattern similar to PSC (150). Since patients with IAC usually 
benefit from treatment with corticosteroids, all patients with 
suspected PSC should be tested for elevated serum-IgG4 levels 
(124). However, 10–12% of patients with classical PSC might have 
increased levels of IgG4 as well (150). It is unclear to date, whether 
these patients represent a subgroup of PSC with a different clini￾cal presentation or course of disease.
CONCLUSION
Testing for autoantibodies is required to diagnose AIH and PBC, 
and it may be helpful to diagnose selected patients with PSC. 
IFT on tissue sections and HEp-2 cells is the screening tool of 
choice in patients with suspected autoimmune liver disease. 
Immunofluorescence pattern on HEp-2 cells must be reported 
to correctly interpret obtained results. ELISA for anti-SLA/LP 
should be included in the diagnostic workup not to miss patients 
only presenting with these rather AIH-specific antibodies. Some 
of the autoantibodies may be associated with disease course, and 
emerging data on novel antibodies in PSC may help to elucidate 
the hitherto unknown pathogenesis of disease.
