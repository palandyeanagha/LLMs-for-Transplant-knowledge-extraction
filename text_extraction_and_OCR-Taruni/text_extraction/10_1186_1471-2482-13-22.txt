Abstract
Background: In patients with cirrhosis, the synthesis of coagulation factors can fall short, reflected by a prolonged
prothrombin time. Although anticoagulants factors are decreased as well, blood loss during orthotopic liver
transplantation can still be excessive. Blood loss during orthotopic liver transplantation is currently managed by
transfusion of red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen concentrate.
Transfusion of these products may paradoxically result in an increased bleeding tendency due to aggravated portal
hypertension. The hemostatic effect of these products may therefore be overshadowed by bleeding complications
due to volume overload.
In contrast to these transfusion products, prothrombin complex concentrate is a low-volume highly purified
concentrate, containing the four vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. Previous studies have suggested that
administration of prothrombin complex concentrate is an effective method to normalize a prolonged prothrombin
time in patients with liver cirrhosis. We aim to investigate whether the pre-operative administration of prothrombin
complex concentrate in patients undergoing liver transplantation for end-stage liver cirrhosis, is a safe and effective
method to reduce perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements.
Methods/Design: This is a double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial.
Cirrhotic patients with a prolonged INR (≥1.5) undergoing liver transplantation will be randomized between
placebo or prothrombin complex concentrate administration prior to surgery. Demographic, surgical and
transfusion data will be recorded. The primary outcome of this study is RBC transfusion requirements.
Discussion: Patients with advanced cirrhosis have reduced plasma levels of both pro- and anticoagulant
coagulation proteins. Prothrombin complex concentrate is a low-volume plasma product that contains both
procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins and transfusion will not affect the volume status prior to the surgical
procedure. We hypothesize that administration of prothrombin complex concentrate will result in a reduction of
perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements. Theoretically, the administration of prothrombin complex
concentrate may be associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic complications. Therefore, thromboembolic
complications are an important secondary endpoint and the occurrence of this type of complication will be closely
monitored during the study.

Background
The liver is the site of synthesis of a large part of the
proteins involved in the hemostatic system. When the
function of the liver is reduced due to acute or chronic
liver disease, the hemostatic system can be heavily af￾fected. In patients with cirrhosis, both procoagulant and
anticoagulant hemostatic changes have been described,
leading to a new rebalanced state [1]. First of all, in the
primary hemostasis, platelet number and function can
be significantly affected, mostly due to impaired produc￾tion of thrombopoietin by the liver, reduced platelet sur￾vival and increased in platelet consumption [2-4]. The
defects in platelet function however, can be compensated
by the elevated levels of Von Willebrand factor (VWF),
an important endothelial-derived platelet adhesion pro￾tein [5,6]. Secondly, there is a decrease in coagulation
factors synthesized by the liver. In particular the levels
of vitamin K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX
and X correlate negatively with the severity of disease
[7]. However, not only levels of pro-coagulant proteins
are decreased in liver disease, the liver also synthesizes co￾agulation inhibitors and both pro- and anti-fibrinolytic
proteins, which are also affected. E.g., plasma levels of
vitamin K dependent anti coagulation proteins C and S
are decreased [8]. Additionally, in chronic liver disease, a
hyperfibrinolytic status has been described [9], although
not all studies agree [10]. This hyperfibrinolytic status
may be due to decreased plasma levels of antiplasmin
and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and to a
dysbalance in tissue-type plasminogen activator and its
inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 [11].
Furthermore, laboratory features of fibrinolysis include
increased levels of markers of fibrinolytic activity such
as D-dimers, but it must be noted that increased levels
of these products may also be caused by accumulation
as a result of decreased clearance [10].
Although the defects in coagulation factors would sug￾gest that there is a bleeding tendency, both thrombotic
events as well as bleeding complications may occur in
patients with advanced liver disease. This might be
explained by the fact that, although there is a rebalanced
state, both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are de￾creased. The new rebalanced hemostasis is more preca￾rious and susceptible for decompensation towards hypo￾or hypercoagulability by factors such as infection, surgery,
blood loss, transfusion, hypothermia etc. Furthermore, the
bleeding tendency in chronic liver disease patients is
much less predictable than in patients with a congenital
defect in their coagulation system, e.g. hemophilia [1].
Laboratory tests in chronic liver disease, such as the
prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized
ratio (INR), often suggest a hypocoagulable state. How￾ever, these tests do not represent the newly formed ba￾lance between pro- and anticoagulant proteins, since
these tests are not sensitive for deficiencies of the anti￾coagulant proteins [12]. In contrast with the findings of
these routine laboratory tests, the coagulation potential
in cirrhotic patients appears to be normal or even super￾ior to that of healthy individuals when tested by throm￾bin generation assays [13-15].
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a major
hemostatic challenge, which often requires transfusion
of blood products. In the past decades blood loss during
OLT has gradually decreased despite the fact that the
conventional laboratory measurements like PT and INR
still indicate hypocoagulability. It is unclear whether the
prolonged PT and INR should be left out of consider￾ation since studies have demonstrated that these mea￾surements do not predict blood loss and transfusion
requirements during OLT [16-18]. Furthermore throm￾bin generation assays during OLT, similar to thrombin
generation assays in cirrhotic patients, indicate a normal
to hypercoagulable status [19]. Nevertheless, excessive
blood loss during OLT does still occur and transfusion
of blood products during liver transplantation is associ￾ated with a higher risk of mortality, postoperative multi
organ dysfunction, and reduced graft survival [20-22].
Clinical strategies to reduce blood loss include the use
of blood products to correct pre-existing coagulopathy
(assessed by prolonged PT and high INR) by transfusion
of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelet concentrate, cryo￾precipitate or fibrinogen, or antifibrinolytic agents to
correct hyperfibrinolysis that may occur during the pro￾cedure. A major disadvantage of transfusion of blood
products such as FFP is volume overload. To correct a
prolonged PT several units of FFP are needed, which will
result in an increase in central venous and portal (splanch￾nic) venous blood pressure, which may in fact increase the
bleeding risk. Especially in patients with cirrhosis, who
already have a relative fluid overload and increased
splanchnic venous circulating volume, intravenous fluid
administration will result in an increase in splanchnic
Arshad et al. BMC Surgery 2013, 13:22 Page 2 of 12

venous pressure [23]. Portal and splanchnic hypertension
are important risk factors for blood loss during OLT and
several authors advocate not correcting pre-operative rou￾tine coagulation test by infusion of large volumes of FFP,
maintaining a low venous pressure by fluid restriction, or
even phlebotomy to prevent excessive blood loss during
OLT [24-28].
Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are hemo￾statically active highly purified concentrates, prepared
from pooled plasma [29]. They contain four vitamin K￾dependent clotting factors (F) II, VII, IX and X [30]. Pre￾vious studies have suggested that administration of PCC
is an effective method to normalize a prolonged PT in
patients with liver cirrhosis [31-33]. A major advantage
of PCC is their low volume load. In contrast to FFP,
administration of PCC is not associated with a fluid
challenge and the subsequent risk of further increasing
portal and systemic venous blood pressure. The question
arises whether the administration of a low volume
prohemostatic product such as PCC, prior to an invasive
procedure in a patient with liver disease, is helpful in re￾ducing blood loss.
PCCs may be related with an increased risk of thrombo￾embolic complications, including venous thromboembolism,
acute myocardial infarction, and disseminated intravascular
coagulation [34,35]. The link between these reported
thromboembolic events and PCC infusion has, however,
often been brought into question [30]. Recently, PCC was
also proposed for the management of massive peri- and
postoperative bleeding [30,36-40]. In some of these re￾ports additional administration of PCC seemed to reduce
blood loss and mortality in patients suffering from massive
bleeding, either treated with vitamin K antagonists or not.
Furthermore, no thromboembolic events were reported.
Composition of the currently and previously marketed
PCC formulations differs and the thrombotic risk presum￾ably depends on the composition of the product. The
thrombotic risk of recently introduced formulations is in￾completely evaluated. A review summarizing several
aspects of PCC including safety concludes that thrombo￾embolic events are rare and several recent case series have
shown that high PCC doses (40 IU/kg) are safe even in
high risk patients [41,42].
CofactW (Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, The
Netherlands) contains balanced amounts of prothrom￾bin complex factors, low levels of activated coagulation
factors and a substantial amount of anticoagulant pro￾teins C and S and antithrombin. Both products do not
contain heparin. In 1973, Sanquin started with the
large-scale production of its first generation of PCC.
Since then, no thromboembolic events have been
reported. In addition, the manufacturing of this plasma
derived product contains 2 robust virus removal steps.
The current indication for PCC is bleeding and
perioperative prophylaxis of bleeding in acquired or
congenital deficiency of (one of ) the four vitamin K￾dependent clotting factors. This includes the treatment
of deficiencies of the four vitamin-K dependant-clotting
factors in liver disease.
The ability of PCC to successfully reduce transfusion
requirements in liver transplantation has not been
established yet. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the
hemostatic efficacy and safety of preoperative CofactW
administration (during induction of anaesthesia) on the
initial requirement of hemostatic products during sur￾gery in cirrhotic patients with severe coagulopathy
undergoing a first liver transplantation.
Methods/design
Design and objectives
The study is designed as a multicenter, double blind, ran￾domized placebo-controlled trial. The study is investigator￾initiated.
The primary objective is to study the hemostatic effi￾cacy of preoperative PCC administration in patients with
cirrhosis and severe coagulopathy undergoing liver trans￾plantation. The hemostatic efficacy will be primarily moni￾tored by recording the need for RBC transfusion.
The secondary objective is to study the hemostatic
safety of preoperative PCC administration in patients
with cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation. The
hemostatic safety will be monitored by adverse event
surveillance and laboratory measurements, with a special
focus on thrombogenicity.
All study procedures during this study are summarized
in Table 1.
Investigational medicinal product (IMP)
The study drug is PCC (CofactW, Sanquin, The Netherlands)
and the placebo is NaCl 0.9%. The known and potential
risks of PCC are described in the summary of product char￾acteristics (SPC). In this population, the theoretical risk for
thromboembolic complications is a special point of care.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint will be the number of RBC units
transfused during the OLT procedure and in the 24 hour
post-surgery period, starting from arrival at the ICU.
Other efficacy endpoints are (measured during surgery
and during the 24-hour period post-surgery):
 The number of transfused units of fresh-frozen
plasma
 The number of transfused units of platelet
concentrate
 Fibrinogen concentrate administration
 Estimated blood loss
 Antifibrinolytic drugs

Participating centers
Two Dutch medical universities are participating in this
trial:
– University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)
– Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam (Erasmus MC
Rotterdam)
Two Belgian medical universities are participating in
this trial:
– University Hospitals Leuven (KULeuven)
– Hospital Erasmus Brussels
One Finish hospital is participating in this trial:
– Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa
(HUS Helsinki)
Study subjects
Adult patients on the waiting list for liver transplant￾ation because of cirrhotic liver disease and a prolonged
INR (≥1.5) will be asked for informed consent. Inclusion
and exclusion criteria are summarized in Table 2. Upon
admission in the participating center for OLT, the inclu￾sion and exclusion criteria and the informed consent will
be double-checked. Patient with co-morbidities or a
medical history that increases the risk for bleeding or
thrombotic events during and after OLT will be ex￾cluded from participation. All patient characteristics, in￾cluding demographic data, medical history and type of
liver disease will be recorded. Participating patients will
be monitored in a follow up of 30 days after inclusion.
Randomization and blinding
The surgical and anesthesiological team must remain
blinded for the intervention during the entire duration
of the trial. Randomization will be performed using an
randomization website. We will stratify per center, and
for patient age and gender. Randomization and prepa￾ration of the Investigational Medical Product (IMP),
whether this is PCC or placebo, will be performed by an
independent employee who is not involved in this trial,
in the OLT or in post-operative care. The IMP will be
delivered in a blinded syringe to the anaesthesiologist
and administered by the anaesthesiologist.
Intervention and dosage
The IMP will be administered during induction of anaesthe￾sia, maximum 30 minutes prior to incision. The IMP,
whether this is PCC or placebo will be administered
according to the SPC of CofactW/PPSB-D, intravenously
and with a recommended infusion speed of 2 ml per mi￾nute. The dosage will be determined according to
bodyweight, preoperative INR and target INR (≤1.5), as
recommended in the SPC of CofactW and as illustrated by
Table 3. The same calculated dosage applies for the placebo.
The dosages are calculated based on the factor IX con￾centration in PCC (the above dosage refers to ml of
PCC). Calculated amounts are rounded mathematically
on multiples of 10 ml and an upper limit of 60 or
100 ml in total was set (see tables above). The target
INR values are recommended by the Federation of
Dutch Thrombosis Services and are of the same order as
English and German recommendations.
Transfusion guidelines
The following guidelines have been established for
homogenous transfusion policy in all participating centers:
 Fresh frozen plasma: During surgery the use of fresh
frozen plasma is allowed in

 case of ongoing bleeding and hypocoagulability
indicated by TEG or ROTEM as evaluated by the
responsible anesthesiologist. Type of FFP, number of
units and volume will be recorded in the case record
form (CRF).
 RBC transfusions when hematocrit <25%: Adjustment
can be performed at several time points; the units
given before surgery do not count for the endpoint
calculations, only those given during and directly after
surgery (within 24 h of arrival at ICU) count for
determination of endpoint. Number of units and
volume of transfusion will be recorded in the CRF.
 Phlebotomy when hematocrit >30%: If the
hematocrit post-operatively remains
 persistently elevated above 30, a phlebotomy will be
performed to lower the hematocrit if the patient is
stable and does not have an active bleeding.
 Platelet concentrate: Administration is permitted
when platelet counts fall below 50,000/mm3 and in
the presence of ongoing blood loss or if it is found
necessary e.g. to prevent bleeding during OLT.
Type, units and volume of platelet concentrate will
be recorded in the CRF.
 Fibrinogen concentrate: Administration is permitted
when fibrinogen levels are < 1.0
 g/L in the presence of ongoing blood loss. = >
Transfuse 30 mg/kg.
 Tranexamic acid: During the procedure TEG of
ROTEM will be used to evaluate fibrinolytic
potential during the procedure (see chapter 7.1.3).
Upon detection of hyperfibrinolysis on the TEG or
ROTEM device in presence of ongoing bleeding due
to presumed coagulopathy, a bolus of 1 gram
tranexamic acid will be given. The bolus can be
repeated in case of insufficient effect on TEG/
ROTEM and clinical picture.
 Other transfusion products will be given according
to the standard procedures at the individual liver
transplantation centers.
 Topical hemostatic agents: Whenever clinically
indicated topical administration of hemostatic
drugs/agents (e.g. collagen) is allowed (recorded as
concomitant medication).
 Cell savers: During the course of this trial, no cell
savers will be used by participating patients.
 Escape medication: In case of a critical bleeding
(by clinical judgment) during the liver
transplantation procedure, treatment can be
initiated in accordance with hospital guidelines and
procedures e.g. antifibrinolytic drugs at habitual
doses. All data on critical bleeding episodes should
be reported as a serious adverse event. Type and
amount of the escape medication and the
justification will be recorded in the CRF.
 Enoxaparin or other low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH): LMWH will be administered postoperatively
as usual for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Dosing will be according to routine local practice.
Thromboelastography (TEG)
During the surgical procedure the transfusion will be
guided by TEG of ROTEM (Rotational Elastometry).
TEG/ROTEM has to be performed at least twice during
the surgical procedure:
– 15 minutes after start anhepatic phase
– 30 minutes after start reperfusion phase
Parameters during surgery
The following data will be recorded for participating
patients:
– Donor characteristics
– Recipient characteristics
– Liver transplantation technique (conventional versus
piggy-back)
– Use of veno-venous bypass
– Data on timing (cold-ischemia time, warm-ischemia
time, duration anhepatic phase etc.)
– Surgical abnormalities and technical difficulties
including heavy blood loss due to diffuse oozing or
accidental vascular injury

– Ascites upon opening abdomen
– Lowest PH, Ca2+, lactate, temperature (during and
within the first 24 hours of surgery)
– Transfusion requirements (during and within the
first 24 hours of surgery)
– Medication (during and within the first 24 hours of
surgery)
– Colloid/Crystalloid/Albumin/Gelatine infusion
(during and within the first 24 hours of surgery)
Laboratory parameters
– Prior to the OLT, an INR measurement will be
performed to check if the patient still meets the
inclusion criteria. After administration of the IMP,
no routine INR measurements will be performed by
the anaesthesiologist during the course of surgery,
since measuring the INR will likely unblind the
anaesthesiologist for the intervention.
– A blinded INR measurement will be performed
(see section ‘Additional Study Procedures’) by an
independent assistant 30 minutes after
administration of the intervention and will only be
available for an independent researcher. These
measurements will be used during the interim
analysis.
– Troponin levels are recorded just before and after
surgery at ICU admission and the day after surgery,
and in case of a suspected event due to clinical
symptoms or ECG abnormalities during routine
testing according to routine clinical practice.
– During OLT other laboratory and coagulation
measurements (with the exception of the PT) may
be performed according to local practice.
– Post-operatively, laboratory measurements presented
in Table 4 will be performed from day 1–7 in the
first week which is currently common practice in
participating centers. From the second week, these
laboratory measurements are only obligatory on day
14 and 30 (within a 24 hour timeframe).
Surgical and anesthesiological procedure
There is no change in surgical or anesthesiological pro￾cedure from the current practise in participating centers.
Postoperative procedure
The patient will be followed postoperatively according to
local practise:
– Low molecular weight heparin as prophylaxis for
deep venous thrombosis.
– Daily laboratory measurements in the first week
– Ultrasound of the hepatic vessels within 24 hours of
surgery, at day 3 and day 7 postoperative
Additional study procedures
The following additional procedures are included for the
study subjects and are not part of the local practice:
 Prior to intervention and after intervention viral
safety blood samples will be collected
 During the OLT-procedure, 30-minutes after
administration of the IMP, a blinded INR
measurement will be performed. The result of this
measurement will be kept blinded for the
anesthesiology and surgical team but will be
recorded by an independent researcher. These
results will be used during the interim analysis to
investigate whether the INR in the PCC-group
reached a value below 1.5 or whether the dosages of
PCC need adjusting.
 Troponin levels are recorded just before and after
surgery at ICU admission and the day after surgery.
 At 12 time points an additional blood sample will be
collected from the patient for satellite studies on e.g.
thrombin generation and fibrinolysis after
completion of this trial. See Table 5 for the time
points.
 On day 3 and 7 physical examination is performed
with special attention to clinical venous
thromboembolic events. In case of suspected deep
venous thrombosis Doppler ultrasonography and on
suspicion of pulmonary embolism a CT-angiography
will be performed. If indeed a thrombotic
complication occurs in the deep venous system or in
the pulmonary arterial circulation, therapy will be
initiated according to the local practice and with
regards to the patient’s post-transplant status.
 A 12-lead electrocardiogram performed on the day
of treatment prior to the intervention and product
administration and 3 and 7 days post surgery and on
clinical indication.

Statistics
Sample size
Based on experience in the participating centers, it is as￾sumed that cirrhotic patients undergoing OLT have a
mean transfusion requirement of 8 U RBC (SD = 4 U).
This data was derived from a retrospective data analysis
of transfusion requirements during OLT in the UMCG
over 2008–2011. The sample size of this trial was chosen
to detect a reduction of 2 units of RBCs with approxi￾mate 80% power. The following statistical formula for
sample size calculation was used to determine the sam￾ple size. N = 16σ2 / d2
.
With an expected 10% withdrawal or loss of study sub￾jects we concluded that 70 patients in each group are re￾quired to demonstrate a difference between placebo and
PCC administration.
Interim analysis
One interim analysis will be performed by the trial stat￾istician after 70 patients (50% of the sample size) have
been included.
The Sponsor has chosen different boundaries for the
different endpoints for the interim analysis, giving more
significance to early unfavourable trends then to early
beneficial trends. These boundaries are more used as
guidelines rather than absolute rules.
For the efficacy endpoint, the O’Brien-Fleming se￾quential boundary will be used to correct for the in￾stability of efficacy parameters at the beginning of the
trial. For a total number of 2 planned statistical analyses
and one planned interim analysis a Z-value of 3 with a P
of 0.0027 will be used to determine statistical signifi￾cance during the interim analysis. During the final ana￾lysis a Z-value of 2 and a P-value of 0.045 will be used to
determine statistical significance.
For the safety endpoints, we have chosen to use the
Pocock sequential boundary, dictating a Z-value of 2
and thus a P-value of 0.045 to determine statistical
significance in harm between the two groups during the
interim analysis as well as the final analysis.
Besides the efficacy and safety endpoint, during the in￾terim analysis, sample size assumptions will be moni￾tored based on the transfusion requirements in the
placebo- group and if needed the sample size will be ad￾justed. Also, results from the blinded INR-measurements
30 minutes after intervention in de PCC-group will be
used to determine whether the PCC-dose sufficiently
lowers the INR in this patients group of whether the dose
needs adjusting during the further conduct of this trial.
The trial may be stopped early due to one of the fol￾lowing situations:
– Unacceptable safety concerns: The analysis shows
significant (serious) adverse events in the treatment
group compared to the placebo group.
– The results on the endpoint between treatment￾group and placebo group are inconclusive and it is
expected that no significance will be reached.
– The interim analysis shows a clear benefit in the
treatment group compared to the placebo group.
– In case new external information arises that
convincingly answers the study question or raises
serious safety issues.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses will be performed using the statistical
software package SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Two-sided tests using the 5% critical level will be used
throughout. The Mann–Whitney U test will be used to
determine a significant difference in transfusion needs
between the 2 groups. Intergroup categorical data will
be compared using Chi-square or Fisher exact test.
Intergroup continuous data will be analyzed with para￾metric or non-parametric analysis methods depending
on the presence/absence of Gaussian distribution. If re￾quired, appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons
will be applied. Independent risk factors for bleeding di￾athesis and transfusion during OLT will be identified
using uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
All variables that reached a P < = 0.05 in the univariate
analysis will be included in the multivariate linear re￾gression analysis. P <0.05 will be considered statistically
significant.

Drug accountability
The local pharmacy in each participating centre is re￾sponsible for the correct storage and management of
medication. All study medication (used, partially used
and unused) will be noted on the provided Drug Ac￾countability Form. The vials with remaining content
will be disposed after usage, a signed record of all used
study medication will be retained for inspection by the
Monitor after completion of the trial. No study medi￾cation may be dispensed to any persons except to the
subjects enrolled in the trial.
Additional burden and risk associated with trial
participation
Since PCC contains procoagulant proteins, there is a
theoretical risk of thromboembolic complications associ￾ated with administration of this product.
PCC is manufactured from human plasma from liv￾ing blood donors and thus the risk for viral transmit￾table disease cannot fully be excluded. The risk for
transmittance is minimized by testing and screening
the donor for past exposure to certain viruses. By test￾ing donors for the presence of certain current viral in￾fection, and by inactivation and elimination of certain
viruses, the risk for transmission is further reduced. In
this trial, to monitor viral safety of the PCC product,
pre-treatment and post-treatment blood samples will
be taken and stored until 1 year after the last patient is
out of the trial.
There is a small risk for allergic or anaphylactic re￾action to the study product PCC. In case of such an
event, treatment with PCC will be ceased immedi￾ately. A severe anaphylactic reaction can lead to
shock and can be life threatening. There is expertise
in every participating centre to manage and treat such
an event.
The following additional procedures will be performed
in patients participating in the PROTON-trial:
– Prior to intervention, blood samples for viral safety
check will be collected
– The intervention during induction of anesthesia
consisting of receiving a intravenous dose of
placebo or PCC.
– An extra plasma sample (together with routine lab)
taken from the patient during 12 time points in the
trial with regards to patient safety.
– A blinded INR measurement will be performed
30 minutes after intervention
– On day 3 and 7 Physical examination will be
performed with special attention to clinical venous
thromboembolic events.
– Extra electrocardiographic examination will be
performed twice during the trial.
Safety reporting
In accordance to section 10, subsection 1, of the
WMO, the Investigator will inform the subjects and the
reviewing accredited medical ethics committee (MEC)
if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that
the disadvantages of participation may be significantly
greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The
trial will be suspended pending further review by the
accredited MEC, except insofar as suspension would
jeopardize the subjects health. The Investigator will
take care that all subjects are kept informed.
DSMB
To ensure the safeguarding of the included patients and
the expected additional burden with trial participation,
a DSMB with independent experts has been installed.
The advice(s) of the DSMB will be provided on a regu￾lar basis after receipt, review and analysis of the interim
and final efficacy and safety data to the Sponsor and In￾vestigators and to the MEC that approved the protocol.
Withdrawal of individual subjects
Subjects and Investigator can decide to terminate par￾ticipation in this trial at any time for any reason, particu￾lar safety reasons, if they wish to do so without any
consequences.
Premature termination of the trial
The trial will be terminated prematurely if we find a
high rate of Serious Adverse Events in the PCC-group
during the interim analysis, possibly liable to the study
product.
(Serious- ) adverse events and suspected unexpected serious
adverse reactions (SUSAR)
All adverse events (AE) will be recorded in the CRF.
Since orthotopic liver transplantation is a surgical
procedure with significant morbidity and mortality, we
will report serious adverse events (SAE) once every
three months in line listing to all accredited MEC and
the DSMB. SAE resulting in death and suspected un￾expected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) will be
reported real time to the Sponsor. The Sponsor will
notify all accredited MEC, the DSMB and the Compe￾tent Authorities (CA) if necessary.
Annual safety report
In addition to the expedited reporting of SUSARs, the
Sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the cli￾nical trial, a safety report to the accredited MREC, CA,
Medicine Evaluation Board and CA of the concerned
Member States.

Ethical considerations
This trial will be conducted according to the principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki and according to Good
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The trial has been
approved by the Medical Ethical Committee (MEC) of
the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) for
all Dutch participating centers. The trial has to be ap￾proved by the MEC of participating centers in other
countries before those centers can start with the inclu￾sions. Prior to randomization, written informed consent
has to be obtained from all participants.
All participating centers have an insurance policy for
patients participating in this trial in their centers,
according to the legal requirements in their country and
all centers are required to inform the participating pa￾tients about the insurance policy.
Data and material collection
All trial data will be anonymous collected in the Case
Record Form (CRF). Patient will be ascribed a unique
study number and a unique randomization number.
Name, address and date of birth will be stored separately
from the trial data. Independent monitoring will be
established to ensure that this trial is conducted,
recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol
and GCP. The Investigators, members of the Health In￾spection and members of the Medical Ethical Commit￾tee have access to personal data. With informed consent
research data will be stored during 15 years. Human ma￾terial will be stored non-traceable for 15 years, when in￾formed consent is obtained. We expect that the stored
material will be very valuable for future research.
Discussion
Patients with end-stage liver disease have an abnormal
hemostatic system which is characterized by reduced
plasma levels of both pro- and anticoagulant proteins.
This results in a hemostatic balance that is more fragile
than in healthy persons, a phenomenon that has been
described as the ‘rebalanced hemostatic system’ [1]. This
rebalanced, yet more fragile, hemostatic system is com￾patible with the observed higher incidence of bleeding
as well as thromboembolic complications in patients
with end-stage liver disease. An additional factor that
plays a critical role in the increased bleeding risk in
these patients is the presence of portal hypertension. Es￾pecially, when patients with cirrhosis require an abdom￾inal surgery, the risk of bleeding during the procedure is
related to the increased pressure in the portal vein and
the venous splanchnic circulation. Fluid overload and se￾questration of volume in the venous circulation may
contribute to this component of the increased bleeding
tendency in patients with cirrhosis when undergoing
surgery. Based on this knowledge a restrictive fluid
infusion and blood product transfusion policy has been
propagated in these patients [25-28].
PCC is a low volume plasma product that contains high
concentrations of both pro- and anticoagulant proteins. In
contrast to the traditional infusion of FFP to stimulate co￾agulation in cirrhotic patients, PCC does not add to the
intravascular volume and therefore may be, theoretically,
more effective in reducing bleeding complications than
FFP infusion. The efficacy and safety of PCC in patients
with liver cirrhosis requiring major abdominal surgery,
however, has never been demonstrated.
A potential side effect of PCC in patients with cirrho￾sis may be a higher risk of thromboembolic complica￾tions. Thromboembolic complications are not infrequent
after OLT and when thrombosis occurs in one of the
hepatic vessels, this may lead to graft loss. In addition,
patients undergoing OLT are at increased risk of devel￾oping central venous thromboembolic complications
such as intracardiac thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
[43]. The PCC we are going to use in our study is com￾mercially available under the product name CofactW.
The efficacy and safety of CofacW has been evaluated in
several clinical studies and so far there has been no indi￾cation of an increased risk of tromboembolic events in
participating patients [42,44-46]. However, most of these
trials have been conducted in patients using vitamin K
antagonists. There has been no trial reporting the use of
CofactW in cirrhotic patients. With regards to the nature
of the product, the disturbed hemostasis in cirrhotic pa￾tients and the hemostatic disturbances caused by the
OLT, we decided that thromboembolic complications
will be an important secondary and safety endpoint in
this trial.
For our primary endpoint we have chosen the number
of transfused units of RBC. Blood loss will be registered
as well, but should be considered as less stable param￾eter as blood loss will be mixed with ongoing loss of
ascites.
The dosage of PCC will be determined for each indi￾vidual patient, based on preoperative bodyweight and
INR. We will not try to subtract preexisting ascites from
the measured bodyweight as this will be hard to quantify
preoperatively. Moreover, it can be expected that a pro￾portion of the PCC will be lost through diffusion into
the ascites. The current dosages of CofactW are based on
calculations used for the correction of a prolonged INR
in patients receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy. We
do not know yet whether the same dosing scheme can
be used for patients with a prolonged INR due to liver
insufficiency. To confirm adequate dosing of PCC we
will perform a interim analysis of the INR measurements
in stored plasma sampled taken in each patient 30 mi￾nutes after the administration of the trial medication.
These INR measurements will be performed by a central
Arshad et al. BMC Surgery 2013, 13:22 Page 10 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2482/13/22

laboratory and data will be analyzed by an independent re￾searcher who is not involved in conduction of the study.
The blinded INR measurements will be used to assess
whether the dosing is sufficient or needs adjusting. No
INR measurements will be performed during OLT by the
local teams.
During the conduction of this trial the surgical and
anesthesiological team, treating physicians, and all inves￾tigators have to remain blinded for the intervention.
This raised a few practical challenges which will be dealt
with by a standardized procedure for preparation of the
study medication. On-site training and instructions will
be given to the local investigators and teams to ensure
adequate compliance with these procedures. One of the
challenges we have dealt with is that PCC has a light
blue color when dissolved. This blue color is visible
when the product is in a syringe, but not when flushed
through an infusion line. To keep the local teams
blinded for the medication group we have chosen to
wrap the syringes in aluminum foil before presenting
them to the anaesthesiologist.
Randomization and preparation of the study medica￾tion will be performed outside the operating theatre by
an independent assistant who is not further involved in
the patient’s care or in the conduct of this trial.
