Abstract
Background: There is currently no worldwide consensus for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). We evaluated the efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as the
initial treatment for HCC with extensive PVTT based on a relatively large number of patients.
Methods: In our multidisciplinary approach for patients with hepatobiliary tumors, SBRT is recommended for
unresectable HCC with PVTT or those with contraindication for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The aim is to
shrink the tumor thrombus and preserve adequate portal venous flow, thus facilitating subsequent treatments such as
TACE and tumor resection. In the present study, 70 continuous cases of HCC patients with extensive PVTT initially
treated with SBRT were studied. The median follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 1.0–21.0 months). The dynamic
changes of tumor thrombosis with time after SBRT were also analyzed.
Results: The median survival time for the whole group was 10.0 months (95% CI, 7.7–12.3 months), with a 6- and 12-
month overall survival (OS) rate of 67.3%, and 40.0% respectively. Patients who received combined SBRT and
TACE showed significantly longer OS than those without indication for TACE after SBRT (12.0 ± 1.6 vs. 3.0 ± 1.
0 months). Patients with good response to radiation usually had better survival. SBRT was well tolerated in our
patient series.
Conclusions: In conclusion, SBRT used as the initial treatment for HCC patients with extensive PVTT originally unsuitable
for resection or TACE can achieve adequate thrombus shrinkage and portal vein flow restoration in the majority of cases.
It could thus offer the patients an opportunity to undergo further treatment such as resection or TACE procedure. Such
therapeutic strategy may result in survival advantage, especially for those who do receive combined modality with SBRT.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
prevalent cancer worldwide [1]. In China, HCC is the
fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third
leading cause of cancer death [2]. Macrovascular inva￾sion (MVI) is common in HCC; in such case, tumor
cells invade the portal veins, hepatic veins, or the in￾ferior vena cava in the liver [3, 4]. Portal vein tumor
thrombus (PVTT) is the most common form of MVI
in HCC, with an incidence ranging from 44 to 62.2%
[5]. About 10% to 60% of HCC patients have PVTT at
the time of diagnosis [6, 7]. Although the survival rate
of patients with HCC has been improved recently, the
prognosis for those with PVTT remains poor, as their
median survival is only 2–4 months via supportive
care [8]. Overall, PVTT plays a major role in predict￾ing the therapeutic outcome and clinical staging of
HCC [9, 10].
There is currently no widely-accepted consensus for the
management of HCC with PVTT. According to some
guidelines in Europe and America, HCC with PVTT is
regarded as Stage C per Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) Staging system, and sorafenib alone is recom￾mended as the treatment of choice [11]. In Southeast
Asian countries, modalities including surgery, radiother￾apy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and/or so￾rafenib are involved in the multidisciplinary treatment of
HCC with PVTT [12, 13]. Surgical treatment is recom￾mended for suitable HCC patients with type I/II PVTT
[14–16]. However, the management of HCC with exten￾sive portal vein involvement remains complicated and
controversial. Patients with PVTT extended to the main
portal vein or the contralateral branch had no survival
benefit after surgical treatment [17]. TACE has been con￾traindicated in the treatment of HCC patients with PVTT
involving the main trunk and/or first branch of the por￾tal vein due to potential risk of liver infarction and hep￾atic failure resulting from ischemia [6, 18]. Several
recent reports have shown that selected patients with
PVTT may benefit from more aggressive treatment mo￾dalities [6, 19] such as a combination of radiotherapy
and TACE. So far, few studies have investigated the effi￾cacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the
treatment of PVTT [20–22].
SBRT has emerged as a new technology which
delivers large dose of radiation to a target in a few
fractions. By taking advantage of the technologic ad￾vancements in precise radiation dose delivery, respira￾tory motion management, and daily image guidance,
SBRT enables accurate targeting of multiple high-dose ra￾diation beams to treat a tumor volume, typically over 1 to
5 fractions. Characterized by rendering a higher biologic￾ally effective dose (BED) than conventionally fractionated
radiotherapy, minimal invasiveness and decreased
morbidity, SBRT can be finished in a week. Such relatively
short treatment course may post less interference with
other therapeutic measures which may also benefit the pa￾tient sequentially in time.
In our multidisciplinary management for patients
with hepatobiliary tumors, SBRT is recommended for
patients with unresectable HCC with PVTT and those
with contraindication for TACE. The aim is to shrink
the tumor thrombus and preserve adequate portal ven￾ous flow, thus facilitating subsequent treatments such
as TACE or tumor resection. In the present report, 70
continuous HCC with extensive PVTT initially treated
with SBRT were analyzed. The therapeutic response,
survival, safety, and treatment strategy were discussed.
Methods
Patient population and radiation treatment
This retrospective study was performed with the ap￾proval of our local ethics committee. From December
2015 to June 2017, 70 continuous HCC patients with
PVTT received SBRT at the Second Affiliated Hospital,
Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The diagnosis
of HCC was based on the American Association for the
Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guideline [23]. Portal
vein invasion was identified by the presence of a
low-attenuation intraluminal filling defect adjacent to the
primary tumor as discerned from contrast-enhanced com￾puted tomography (CT). Cheng’s classification of PVTT
was applied in this study, and comprised of four levels
based on the extent of tumor thrombus in the portal vein
(Fig. 1): type I0, tumor thrombus found only under mi￾croscopy; type I, tumor thrombus involving segmental or
sectoral branches of the portal vein or above; type II,
tumor thrombus involving the right/left portal vein; type
III, tumor thrombus involving the main portal vein; and
type IV, tumor thrombus involving the superior mesen￾teric vein [24]. Basic criteria for SBRT: (1) tumor
thrombus involving the main trunk and/or first branches
of the portal vein, unsuitable for surgery or TACE; (2) an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perform￾ance status (PS) of 0–2; (3) no refractory ascites; (4)
Child–Pugh class A and B, or class C with good perform￾ance status; (5) no previous radiotherapy to the liver; and
(6) more than 700 cc of uninvolved liver. A preliminary
estimate of the uninvolved liver volume was made
using 3D imaging software (IQQA-Liver, EDDA Tech￾nology Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA), whereas its exact vol￾ume was verified from the subsequent SBRT planning
dosimetry (Eclipse software, Varian® Medical Systems,
Palo Alto, CA).
All patients were immobilized in a stereotactic body
frame (Karity, Guangzhou, China) with customized vac￾uum cushion and abdominal compression for control of
respiratory motion. Oral contrast agent (50 ml of 3%
Shui et al. Radiation Oncology (2018) 13:188 Page 2 of 9

Ioversol) was administered before CT simulation. Four-di￾mensional contrast-enhanced computed tomography
(4DCT) simulation (Light Speed RT, GE) was performed at
2.5-mm slice thickness. For breathing movement amplitude
too small to be detected during 4DCT scanning, scans were
taken at end-expiration phase, end-inspiration phase, and
during quiet free-breathing under abdominal compression.
The CT scan during free breathing was then used for treat￾ment planning. The gross tumor volume (GTV) repre￾sented the tumor thrombosis visualized on the contrast
enhanced CT, and magnetic resonance (MR) images. If the
primary hepatic lesion was small (less than 5 cm) and adja￾cent to the PVTT, both portal vein tumor thrombus and
the primary lesion were contoured as the GTV. Internal
target volume (ITV) was defined as the volumetric sum of
GTVs in the multiple phases. The planning target volume
(PTV) included ITV with 3–5 mm margins, to account for
daily set-up variations. PTV was adjusted manually to
minimize overlapping the gastrointestinal tract when indi￾cated. The mean volume of PTV was 390.8 ± 37.6 cm3
,
varying widely from a minimum of 63.0 cm3 to a maximum
of 1452.9 cm3
. Plans were devised such that the prescrip￾tion dose was prescribed at the isodose line encompassing
> 95% of the PTV. The preferred maximum dose within
the PTV was between 110 and 130% of the prescribed dose.
The median prescription dose to PTV was 40 Gy (range,
25–50) in five fractions administered over a week. Organs
at risk (OARs) included liver, kidneys, stomach, duodenum,
small intestine, colon and spinal cord. Dose-volume plan￾ning objectives for the OARs were defined as follows
(Table 1): normal liver, mean dose ≤15 Gy; bilateral kid￾ney, mean dose ≤12 Gy; and spinal cord, maximal
dose<27 Gy. The maximal dose to 1 cc (D1cc) was limited
to 31 Gy for the gastrointestinal tract including stomach,
duodenum, small intestine and colon. Normal liver vol￾ume was defined as the total liver volume minus the PTV.
Target and OAR contouring were performed using Varian
Dosimetrist and Oncologist software (Eclipse software,
Varian® Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Treatment
was delivered with a Varian® Trilogy™ linear accelerator
(Varian® Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) using X-ray
beams of 6–10 MV energy. Daily image guidance was
performed by means of kilovoltage cone-beam CT, with

patients’ 3D positioning verified prior to each radiation
treatment session.
Evaluation
Patients were assessed weekly for toxicities in the first
month after SBRT, monthly for the following two months,
and once every three months thereafter. Treatment-asso￾ciated acute and late toxicities were scored according to
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE; version 3.0). Tumor response was assessed using
the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu￾mors (mRECIST) criteria [25]. The response of PVTT to
SBRT was evaluated by dynamic contrast enhanced CT
and/or MRI at 1, 3, and then every 3 months after SBRT.
Biochemical response was assessed in patients with ele￾vated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level before radiotherapy
and defined as either a ≥ 50% reduction or normalization
of the AFP level within one month after SBRT.
Follow-up and statistical analysis
The cutoff date for the last follow-up was February 28,
2018, for the censored data analysis. The median
follow-up period was 9.5 months (range: 1.0–21.0).
The overall survival (OS) was calculated from the start
of SBRT to the date of either death or the last
follow-up visit. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
analyze the OS, with log-rank test used to examine
group differences. Cox regression model was used for
multivariate analysis. All statistical analyses were per￾formed using SPSS software package (version 20.0;
SPSS Inc., Chicago). A p-value of <0.05 was consid￾ered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 70 HCC patients with PVTT were irradiated
and included in this analysis. Table 2 shows the pa￾tients’ characteristics, classification of PVTT and
radiotherapy scheme. The median age at diagnosis of
PVTT was 53.8 years (range: 25–75). The median time
from primary HCC diagnosis to SBRT treatment was
7 months (range: 0–85). The median time interval be￾tween diagnosis of PVTT and SBRT treatment was
1.2 months (range 0–12). Tumor thrombosis involving
the first order portal vein branches without main por￾tal vein involvement (TypeII) was found in 42 patients
(60%). Twenty- seven patients (38.6%) had tumor
thrombosis invading the main trunk (Type III), one
patient (1.4%) had tumor thrombosis invaded the su￾perior mesenteric vein, portal vein main trunk and
both first branches (Type IV).
Twenty patients (28.6%) received SBRT alone. Another
46 (65.7%) patients received TACE (1–5 cycles, median
2.4 cycles) after SBRT; among them, 3 underwent fur￾ther radioactive seeds implantation, and one received

radiofrequency ablation (RFA) after TACE. The final 4
(5.7%) patients underwent surgery, including 3 with re￾spective liver lobectomy at 3, 8 and 10 weeks after SBRT,
and one patient underwent liver transplantation 4 weeks
after SBRT.
PVTT response
Fifty-three cases had contrast-enhanced CT/MRI around
4 weeks after SBRT, partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), and progression disease (PD) were observed in 41
(77.4%), 8 (15.1%), and 4 (7.5%), respectively. While
none had achieved complete response (CR) by this time
point, there were 5 patients (9.4%) reached near CR with
minimal residual disease less than 10% of original en￾hanced size. Local control (LC) (inclusive of partial and
stable response) was thus achieved in 92.5% of the
treated lesions.
At 3 months after SBRT, 62 patients were assessed for
PVTT therapeutic responses. CR, PR, and SD were ob￾served in 6 (9.7%), 43 (69.4%), and 4 (6.4%) of the pa￾tients, respectively. LC (inclusive of CR, PR and SD) was
achieved in 85.5% of the treated lesions. The rest 9 pa￾tients (14.5%) had PD, including 3 cases having devel￾oped PD at the first follow-up.
Six months after SBRT, assessments of PVTT thera￾peutic response were done in 31 patients, CR, PR, SD, and
PD were observed in 10 (32.2%), 16 (51.6%), 2 (6.4%), and
3 (9.8%) (including 1 case evaluated as PD beforehand) pa￾tients, respectively. Sixteen patients had follow-up imaging
around 9 months after SBRT, and the respective CR and
PR rate were 56.25% (9 patients) and 43.75% (7), with the
corresponding figures at 12 months being 66.7% (10) and
33.3% (5).
Of the 57 patients with elevated AFP levels before
SBRT, 29 patients (54.7%) exhibited ≥50% reduction in
the AFP levels within one month after SBRT, with 6
cases (11.3%) had AFP in the normal range.
Overall survival
With median follow-up period of 9.5 months, 25 pa￾tients (35.7%) were still alive at the time of the current
analysis. The median survival time for the whole
group was 10.0 months (95% CI, 7.7–12.3), with 6-
and 12-month OS rates of 67.3%, and 40.0%, respect￾ively (Fig. 2a).
Median survival times were 12.0 ± 1.6 and 3 ±
1.0 months for those receiving TACE after SBRT and
SBRT alone, respectively. Patients who received com￾bined treatments of SBRT and TACE showed signifi￾cantly longer OS than those unable to undergo TACE
after SBRT (p < 0.001; Fig. 2b). The 6- and 12-month
OS rates were 82.8%, and 49.7% for patients receiving
SBRT plus TACE, and 30.0%, and 10.0% for those re￾ceiving SBRT alone. Four patients underwent tumor
resection after SBRT, with 1 patient died at the fourth
month while the other 3 were alive at their respective
follow-up time of 13, 15 and 15 months.
The median survival time for patients with PR, SD and
PD of the PVTT at 3 months after completion of SBRT
was 13.0, 8.0 and 4.0 months respectively. The median
survival for the 6 patients with CR was deficiency be￾cause only 2 patients died at seventh and eleventh
month. The other 4 patients remained alive, with 1 pa￾tient assessed at 15-month and 3 at 16-month follow-up
points after SBRT. The median survival times for pa￾tients with LC (inclusive of CR, PR and SD) of the
PVTT were better than those with PD after SBRT (13.0
vs. 4.0 months, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2c).
Interestingly, patients with PVTT at the left branch lo￾cation seemed to have longer median OS than those
with thrombosis in the right branch of portal vein (13.0
vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.079) (Fig. 2d, Table 3).
Toxicity
Patients tolerated the SBRT generally well, since a very
mild pattern of acute toxicity was observed. No
treatment-related deaths or serious adverse events
were seen within 3 months after SBRT. Acute radi￾ation side effects were mild, including nausea, vomit￾ing, anorexia, and abdominal pain in some cases.
Grade-3 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were seen
in 5 (7.1%) and 4 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Grade-3
liver enzyme and bilirubin elevation were found in 3
(4.3%) and 8 (8.6%) cases, while grade-3 albumin de￾crease was seen in 11 (15.7%). No grade-4 hematologic
toxicity, liver enzyme, bilirubin and albumin level
change was seen. No radiation induced liver disease
was encountered in the entire patient group. Later
toxicities such as gastrointestinal stenosis, bleeding,
perforation and ulcer were not observed during the
follow-up periods.

Only one patient (1.4%) showed progression of Child￾Pugh class from A to C within 3 months after SBRT, while
progression from class B to C was observed in 2 cases. All
these 3 patients were deteriorated due to intrahepatic
tumor progression. Downgrading of Child-Pugh class
from B to A was observed in 3 cases.
Discussion
In the present study, SBRT was used as the first therapy
for the management of HCC patients with extensive
PVTT. These patients were originally unsuitable for sur￾gery or had contraindication for TACE. SBRT induced
prominent response in the PVTT. The objective re￾sponse rate at 1, 3, 6 months were 77.4%, 79.1% and
83.8%, respectively. Within 1 month after SBRT, 5 cases
reached near CR, i.e., minimal residual disease less than
10% of initial lesion. Remarkably, the CR rate increased
with time, from 9.7% at 3 months to 32.2% at 6 months
after SBRT. For the 16 patients with imaging reassess￾ment at 9 months after treatment, more than half
achieved CR. Progression after SBRT was found in about
17.1% of the cases, with most PD occuring within the
first 3 months. In our series, 4 patients had PD of the
PVTT within 1 month, 6 between 1 and 3 months, and
only 2 patients at 6 months. To the best of our know￾ledge, this appears to be the first report describing the
dynamic changes of tumor thrombosis after SBRT.
Around 70% of our PVTT cases shrank to a degree of
PR in the first few weeks. Most achieved restoration of
portal vein flow, which relieved the associated symptoms
and made it feasible for patients to endure further inter￾ventional therapies. The strategy seems practical to
shrink the thrombosis and restore the portal flow by
SBRT, thus enable the patients to have the opportunity
to receive subsequent treatments, such as tumor resec￾tion or TACE procedure.
The median survival time from the start of SBRT for
this patient series was 10.0 months, with the respective
6- and 12-month OS rates of 67.3% and 40.0%. Pub￾lished results concerning SBRT in the treatment of
PVTT are scarce, and median survival time has been re￾ported to vary from 8 to 13 months, with 1-year OS rate
from 43.2 to 50.3% [22, 26, 27]. In a prospective study of
phase I and II trials reported by Bujold et al. [28], 56
HCC patients with tumor thrombosis showed a 1-year
OS rate of 44% after SBRT, with which our result seems

comparable. With a median survival time of 12 months,
our patients who got the chance to receive TACE after
SBRT had longer survival time that is comparable to the re￾sults of the previous reports [27]. It is remarkable that pa￾tients in the present study were originally considered to
harbor unresectable tumor or had contraindication for
TACE. This subgroup of patients was expected to have
lower OS rate. In view of such adverse baseline characteris￾tics, the therapeutic outcome with median OS of 10 months
seems satisfactory.
For the 5 patients who achieved near CR within the
first few weeks, all were alive at the last follow-up times
of 20, 17, 17, 16, and 10 months respectively. Those had
CR at 3 months after SBRT also showed longer OS.
Patients with good PVTT response to SBRT usually
have better survival. As for the radiation dose, patients
receiving 40 Gy or more seems to have longer OS
(Table 3). Hence, We suggest higher radiation dose
(≥40Gy in 5 fractions) for the SBRT treatment of
PVTT, with the aim of achieving adequate therapeutic
response and better survival.
The natural history of HCC patients with PVTT dictates
only 2.4–4 months of survival duration [8]. Although
Sorafenib provided a significant survival benefit in ran￾domized phase III trials, the gain was modest (2–
3 months) [29, 30]. Radiotherapy may improve survival
chance for such patients. Yeh et al. reported a large series
of HCC with PVTT treated by conventional three-dimen￾sional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), but the median
survival time was only 7.0 months [31]. Matsuo et al. com￾pared the efficacy of SBRT with 3D-CRT in the manage￾ment of PVTT and better therapeutic results for the
former was observed, with 1-year OS rates of 49.3% in
SBRT group vs. 29.3% in 3D-CRT group. Taking all the re￾sults into consideration, SBRT seems to be of therapeutic
benefit for HCC patients with PVTT, especially for those
who had contraindication for TACE or surgery.
SBRT was well tolerated in our patient series. Only
mild radiation acute side effects were observed in
some of cases. No treatment-related deaths or serious
adverse events were encountered. Furthermore, no ra￾diation induced liver disease was observed, even in
those receiving TACE after SBRT. Those who experi￾enced deterioration of liver function were mainly due
to intrahepatic tumor progression. The low toxicity of
SBRT in the management of PVTT was in line with
the results of other SBRT studies [26, 27].
There are several limitations of the present study
that should be addressed. First, only contrast en￾hanced CT and/or MRI were used for the assessment
of PVTT response, at 1, 3, and then every 3 months
after SBRT. If liver vessel Doppler scan had been uti￾lized in this study, the portal vein blood flow changes
after SBRT might have been detected with higher fre￾quency. Since Doppler exams could be repeated in
shorter intervals, more information could have been
collected in this respect. Second, the study was retro￾spective, with widely varied therapeutic modalities
after SBRT for this group of patients, including TACE,
surgical resection, and one liver transplantation. In
addition, some patients received different number of
TACE sessions. These could represent sources of bias
for the observed data, and one should be cautious in
the interpretation of the clinical outcomes. A well de￾signed prospective study is warranted to validate the
results.

Conclusions
SBRT can be used as the first-line therapy for HCC pa￾tients with extensive PVTT originally considered unsuit￾able for surgical resection or TACE. The dynamic change
of tumor thrombosis in time after SBRT has been de￾scribed. Thrombus shrinkage and portal vein flow restor￾ation can be achieved in the majority of cases. Thereafter,
SBRT may enable patients to pursue consolidative local
treatments, such as surgery and TACE procedure. Such
therapeutic strategy may result in improved survival bene￾fit, especially for those who do receive further therapies
after SBRT.
