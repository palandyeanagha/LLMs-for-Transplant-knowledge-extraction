Pancreatic β cell dysfunction is pathognomonic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is driven by environ￾mental and genetic factors. β cell responses to glucose and to incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are altered in the disease state. While rodent β cells 
act as a coordinated syncytium to drive insulin release, this property is unexplored in human islets. In situ 
imaging approaches were therefore used to monitor in real time the islet dynamics underlying hormone 
release. We found that GLP-1 and GIP recruit a highly coordinated subnetwork of β cells that are targeted by 
lipotoxicity to suppress insulin secretion. Donor BMI was negatively correlated with subpopulation responses 
to GLP-1, suggesting that this action of incretin contributes to functional β cell mass in vivo. Conversely, expo￾sure of mice to a high-fat diet unveiled a role for incretin in maintaining coordinated islet activity, supporting 
the existence of species-specific strategies to maintain normoglycemia. These findings demonstrate that β cell 
connectedness is an inherent property of human islets that is likely to influence incretin-potentiated insulin 
secretion and may be perturbed by diabetogenic insults to disrupt glucose homeostasis in humans.
Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) currently affects approximately 
8.3% of the adult population worldwide, an incidence expected to 
increase further in the coming years (1). Changes in functional 
pancreatic β cell mass, the sole source of circulating insulin in ver￾tebrates, are characteristic of this condition and act in concert with 
defective insulin action to reduce glucose tolerance in genetically 
susceptible individuals (2). Increased circulating levels of glucose, 
fatty acids, and other reactive species then drive the complications 
of this disease including stroke, cardiovascular disease, retinopa￾thy, renal failure, and cancer (3, 4).
The mechanisms underlying glucose-stimulated insulin secre￾tion (GSIS) from single β cells are increasingly well characterized 
and involve uptake of the sugar via specific glucose transporters 
(5), enhanced ATP synthesis (6), and the closure of ATP-sensitive 
K+ channels (KATP) (7). The consequent plasma membrane depo￾larization leads to Ca2+ influx (8) and exocytosis from secretory 
granules (9), further potentiated by “KATP-independent” signals 
(10). In addition to glucose, a range of other secretagogues, 
including gut-derived incretins, serve to amplify insulin release. 
Thus, in response to food transit, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (11) 
are released by enteroendocrine L and K cells, respectively, from 
where they augment GSIS to counteract the postprandial hyper￾glycemic spike (12–15). This so-called “incretin effect” requires 
elevated glycemia, and GLP-1 and GIP receptor activation engages 
intracellular signaling mechanisms largely dependent on cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation (16–18) and acti￾vated Ca2+ influx (19). Since incretins also stimulate antiapoptotic 
and prosurvival pathways in β cells (20), GLP-1 mimetics and 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have become first-line 
antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of T2DM (21). How￾ever, both GLP-1– and GIP-induced insulin secretion are impaired 
in T2DM (22–25), and patients may respond nonoptimally to 
both endogenous and exogenous incretin.
Efforts to better understand the interactions that drive 
GLP-1–augmented (and GIP-augmented) insulin secretion 
from intact islets have, however, proved challenging due to a 
lack of uniformity in microorgan architecture between species. 
This is evident in both the proportions and spatial organiza￾tion of β, α, and other cell types (26). Phylogenetic differences 
in insulin secretion may consequently arise from heterogeneity 
in the intraislet regulation of β cell dynamics, alongside the 
simple summation of distinct cell biophysical properties. Thus, 
in humans, the release of insulin from ensembles of stochasti￾cally-behaving β cells is likely to reflect their unique cytoarchi￾tectural arrangement along laminar epithelial sheets, combined 
with alterations to paracrine and neural input (27–30). As such, 
rodents may represent a nonideal model for investigations of 
human pancreatic β cell dysfunction, especially if diabetogenic 
insults perturb species-specific intraislet mechanisms governing 
β cell population responses.
Using in situ imaging approaches, together with large-scale 
correlation analyses to map cell-cell interconnectivity (31), we 
demonstrate that GLP-1 recruits a highly coordinated subnet￾work of β cells to augment GSIS, and this is targeted by lipotoxic 
insults to reduce insulin secretion. Providing evidence for an 
association with circulating lipid levels in humans, donor BMI 
was found to be negatively correlated with the coordinated β cell

responses to GLP-1. We believe, therefore, that these results reveal 
a novel mode of incretin action that may be targeted by known 
T2DM risk factors to impact insulin release from human islets.
Results
GLP-1 activates a coordinated subpopulation of β cells. Multicellu￾lar calcium (Ca2+) imaging was used to simultaneously moni￾tor Ca2+ signals emanating from fluo-2–loaded β cells residing 
within the first few layers of intact human islets (Supplemental 
Figure 1A [supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI68459DS1]; for data from n = 21 separate normo￾glycemic donors, see Supplemental Table 1; donors across the BMI 
range were selected for experiments using multiple preparations). 
Since exocytosis in electrically excitable endocrine cells is Ca2+
dependent (32), the effects of intervention on the cell population 
dynamics underlying insulin release were determined by subject￾ing the resulting traces to large-scale correlation analyses (31). We 
note that, although α and other neuroendocrine cells comprise a 
substantial proportion (~40%) of the human islet (26), the former 
are unlikely to contribute to the recordings here, since elevated 
glucose is expected to have no effect or to reduce intracellular free 
Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in these cells (33).

Long-lasting optical recordings (30–60 minutes) revealed that, in 
the presence of elevated (11 mM) glucose, β cells displayed mod￾erate levels of coordinated activity due to stochastic Ca2+ oscilla￾tions, as previously reported (Figure 1A and refs. 27, 34). Following 
the application of 10 fM–100 nM (peak response 20 nM) GLP-1 
(7-36 human amide; Supplemental Figure 1, B–E), large and syn￾chronous deflections in [Ca2+]i were associated with dramatic 
improvements in coordinated β-β cell activity (Figure 1B and C; Sup￾plemental Video 1). This was due to the recruitment of a subpopu￾lation of GLP-1–responsive cells (~56% of glucose-responsive cells, 
assumed to be β cells, Figure 1D and E) whose levels of correlated 
Ca2+-spiking activity could be dynamically and transiently modi￾fied by incretin in a glucose-dependent and GLP-1 receptor–depen￾dent (GLP-1R–dependent) manner (43.6 ± 2.7 versus 92.8 ± 3.7% 
significantly correlated cell pairs, before and during GLP-1 20 nM 
application, respectively; n = 9 islets from 4 donors, P < 0.01; Figure 1F 
and G; Supplemental Figure 2). The 3D tissue context was essen￾tial for supporting GLP-1–driven upregulation of coordinated cell 
activity, since this was reduced to almost control levels (~60%) in 
dissociated islets (Figure 1H). The residual synchronization likely 
reflects both the presence of cells (10%–20%) that remained physi￾cally connected (Figure 1I) and the random probability of synchro￾nous activity in otherwise unconnected cells.
Gap junctions orchestrate spatiotemporally precise responses to GLP-1. 
Next, we attempted to define the intercellular mechanisms 
underlying the orchestrated propagation of GLP-1–derived Ca2+

signaling events between β cells. Homotypic gap junctions (GJs) 
composed of connexin 36 (Cx36) are present between human and 
rodent β cells (35, 36) and play an important role in coordinat￾ing the cell-cell information exchanges that underlie pulsatile 
insulin release from rodent islets (36, 37). Application of the GJ 
blocker, 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), but not its inactive ana￾log β-glycyrrhizic acid (BGA), induced asynchrony in the incret￾in-sensitive subpopulation (Figure 2, A and B) and significantly 
reduced the ability of β cells to mount coordinated Ca2+ rises in 
the presence of GLP-1 (83.6 ± 4.4 versus 55.10 ± 7.7% significantly 
correlated cell pairs at 200 seconds, BGA versus AGA, respectively; 
n = 8 islets from 3 donors, P < 0.01; Figure 2C). The GJ blocker 
appeared to be relatively specific, since preincubation of islets 
with AGA: (a) reduced the distance between correlated cell pairs 
from 30 μm to 20 μm, consistent with an effect on GJ-coupling 
conduction and impedance (38) (Gaussian curve fitted to histo￾gram of n = 3 donors; Figure 2D); (b) did not affect the percentage 
of GLP-1–responsive cells (Figure 2E); (c) was unable to signifi￾cantly alter intracellular Ca2+ rises in response to 11 mM glucose or 
20 mM KCl (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B, respectively); and (d) 
yielded identical results to experiments in which gene expression 
was silenced in β cells by greater than 80% using shRNA against 
human Cx36 (Supplemental Figure 4). GJ blockade severely dimin￾ished incretin-stimulated (Figure 2F), but not glucose-stimulated,

using the sensitive membrane-tethered zinc (Zn2+) probe ZIMIR 
(39), suggesting that GLP-1 may drive insulin release by improving 
correlated activity within a subpopulation of β cells (Supplemen￾tal Videos 2 and 3).
Lipotoxicity targets the incretin-sensitive β cell subpopulation to impair 
insulin secretion. To assess whether this novel mode of incretin action 
might be targeted by diabetogenic insults, we incubated human 
islets under lipotoxic conditions (40–42), namely in the presence 
of high levels of the free fatty acid (FFA) palmitate. The effective￾ness of the saturated fatty acid was confirmed by the upregulation 
of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA expression 
(1.00 ± 0.04 versus 1.95 ± 0.24 relative mRNA expression, control 
versus palmitate, respectively; n = 3 donors; P < 0.05) (43). As pre￾viously observed for rodent islets (44), 72-hour incubation with 
palmitate markedly reduced Cx36 protein expression in a protein 
kinase A–dependent (PKA-dependent) manner (24.0 ± 1.6 versus 
11.1 ± 1.4% area occupied by Cx36, control versus palmitate, respec￾tively; P < 0.01 (Figure 3, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 5). 
In parallel, acute Ca2+ responses to forskolin, an adenyl cyclase 
(AC) activator that improves electrotonic coupling between β cells 
through the generation of cAMP (45), were attenuated by expo￾sure to FFAs (Figure 3C; n = 6 recordings). In addition to blunting 
GSIS (Supplemental Figure 6; n = 5 recordings) and consistent 
with its effects on Cx36 expression, palmitate reduced the coordi￾nated activity in response to GLP-1 in a PKA-dependent manner 
(Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 7), decreasing the portion of 
insulin secretion attributable to incretin (i.e., above and beyond 
that stimulated by 11 glucose alone; AUC = 171.4 ± 33.4 versus 
48.0 ± 8.0 AU, control versus palmitate, respectively; n = 8–12 islets 
from 3 donors, P < 0.01; Figure 3E). Although GLP-1 actions are 
in part mediated by PKA, confounding effects of residual block￾ade were unlikely, given that the islets were washed for at least 
1 hour before imaging, incretin-stimulated insulin secretion (ISIS) 
was normal in H89-treated human samples, and acute application 
of the inhibitor failed to alter GLP-1–induced Ca2+ rises (Supple￾mental Figure 8).
The deleterious effects of lipotoxicity were unlikely to be sec￾ondary to signal transmission through an altered or necrotic 
islet core, since islet architecture and cell viability both remained 
constant, as indicated by the α/β cell (Figure 3F) and dead/live 
cell ratios (0.025 ± 0.006 versus 0.020 ± 0.005, control versus 
palmitate, respectively, NS; n = 17 islets from 2 to 3 donors) 
(Figure 3G). Moreover, the observed effects of FFAs were highly 
reproducible between individual islet preparations (Supplemen￾tal Figure 9) and were not due to a reduction in GLP-1 receptor 
(GLP-1R) expression. Thus, cell surface and total GLP-1R lev￾els (n = 7–18 islets from 3 donors; P < 0.05) (Figure 3H and I; 
Supplemental Figure 10), and receptor transcript expression 
(1.00 ± 0.02 versus 2.00 ± 0.33 relative mRNA expression, con￾trol versus palmitate, respectively; n = 7 replicates from 3 donors; 
P < 0.01) (Figure 3J) both increased in response to FFAs. We found 
that palmitate also impaired the correlated responses to GIP 
(Figure 4), suggesting that incretin-regulated β cell connectivity 
represents a conserved process that is vulnerable to lipotoxicity. 
Last, we confirmed the dynamic secretion measures obtained 
using ZIMIR by radioimmunoassay-based (RIA-based) measures 
of insulin release during static incubation of islets (Figure 5).
Excess FFAs do not disrupt global islet responses to other β cell stimuli. 
Given that various stimuli have been shown to alter the coordi￾nated activity of rodent β cells (46, 47), we determined whether 
lipotoxicity might perturb human islet dynamics to reduce insulin 
release evoked by glucose or a range of nonfuel secretagogues. FFAs 
appeared to specifically target incretin action primarily through 
the disruption of β cell interactivity, since impairment of insulin

secretion by palmitate (Supplemental Figure 6) was not accom￾panied by decreases in the percentage of active cells (Figure 6A), 
frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (Figure 6, B and C), amplitude 
and AUC of [Ca2+]i rises (Figure 6D), or long-term evolutions in 
coordinated activity (Figure 6E; correlation calculated over 20 to 
30 minutes) in response to elevated (11 mM) glucose (n ≥4 islets 
from 3 donors). Likewise, we observed that lipotoxicity did not 
affect changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ detected in response to the non￾metabolic depolarizing stimulus tolbutamide (Figure 6F) or the 
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating (IP3-generating) muscarinic 
agonist carbachol (Figure 6H). The coordinated [Ca2+]i rises elic￾ited by both drugs were not disrupted by FFA exposure (Figure 6G 
and I; n = 4 recordings) or GJ blockade (Supplemental Figure 11), 
suggesting that they were likely due to simultaneous depolariza￾tion throughout the recorded β cell population.
Incretin-induced upregulation of coordinated cell activity is species spe￾cific. To determine whether the above findings in human islets 
might be recapitulated in a physiological model of in vivo FFA 
excess, we examined the effects of diet-induced obesity (DIO) in 
mice. As expected, islets isolated from C57/BL6 mice fed a high￾fat diet (HFD) (60% calories from fat) for at least 18 weeks to 
elevate circulating FFA concentrations presented severe glucose 
intolerance (Supplemental Figure 12A) and mild downregula￾tion of Cx36 (Supplemental Figure 12B), as previously shown 
(48), without affecting cell viability (Supplemental Figure 12C; 
n = 5–10 animals) (49). Over half (53%) of the islets from the HFD 
animals displayed disorganized Ca2+ oscillations in response to high 
(11 mM) glucose (Supplemental Videos 4 and 5), yet retained 
apparently normal control GLP-1 responses that resembled those 
from human islets (Figure 7A). Further analyses of these HFD￾responsive islets yielded a significant decrease in the coordina￾tion of glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations compared with those 
from animals fed a normal diet (ND) (90.8 ± 2.9 versus 58.0 ± 
5.2% significantly correlated cell pairs before GLP-1 application, 
ND versus HFD, respectively; n = 8 islets from 4 animals, P < 0.01) 
(Figure 7B). This deficit was reversed by the application of GLP-1, 
as evidenced by restoration of normal levels of coordinated cell 
activity (Figure 7B) and subtly improved ISIS (355.5 ± 27.2 versus 
487.4 ± 30.2 AU, ND versus HFD, respectively; n = 12 islets from 
4 animals, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Calculation of the duty cycle 
revealed that ISIS in the ND animals was associated with increased 
time spent in the active phase, rather than any changes in cor￾related cell-cell Ca2+-spiking activity (Figure 7D). These observa￾tions could be mimicked by the exogenous application of palmi￾tate to isolated mouse islets (Figure 7, E–G, and Supplemental 
Figure 13), confirming a direct action of the lipid on the rodent 
β cell to impair coordinated responses to glucose. Therefore, the 
exaggerated FFA levels associated with an HFD are unlikely to pri￾marily target ISIS. Instead, the oral glucose intolerance detected in 
these mice may result from impaired GSIS and/or defective insulin 
action rather than a diminished incretin effect (49).
BMI is negatively associated with coordinated responses to GLP-1. To 
investigate whether the FFA-impaired incretin responses detected 
in vitro were present in human islets exposed in vivo to excess cir￾culating lipid, as observed with increasing obesity (50), we exam￾ined the relationship between the BMI of individual organ donors 
and GLP-1–stimulated β cell activity. We detected a significantly 
negative linear correlation between donor BMI (spanning the 
normal-obese range) and coordinated β cell responses to GLP-1 
(Figure 8A; R2 = –0.88, P < 0.001). In contrast, the age of the same 
individuals did not correlate with GLP-1–coordinated β cell 
responses (Figure 8B; R2 = –0.07, P = 0.37).
Discussion
The principal aim of the current study was to determine whether 
β cell-β cell coordination is an important element in the response 
of human islets to secretagogues. We show that efficient ISIS from 
intact human islets relies on driving high levels of coordinated 
activity in a 3D organized subnetwork of GJ-interlinked β cells. 
This hitherto unknown mode of incretin action is targeted in vitro 
by lipotoxicity, an insult strongly associated with T2DM risk and 
one that has previously been shown to result in defective GSIS 
(40, 41). Specifically, chronic exposure to elevated FFAs reduces 
insulin release by disrupting intercellular communications, 
impeding the timely propagation of signals throughout the 
GLP-1–sensitive syncytium (see Supplemental Figure 14 for a 
schematic illustration). Donor BMI was negatively associated with 
coordinated islet responses to GLP-1, suggesting that this novel

FFAs suppress GLP-1–stimulated insulin secretion. (A) GLP-1 potentiates insulin secretion in control islets, and this is abolished by palmitate in 
a PKA-dependent manner (Palm + H89) (#P < 0.01 versus 3 mM glucose [G3] and *P < 0.05 versus 16.7 mM glucose [G16.7]; one-way ANOVA).

mode of incretin action may also be perturbed by excess circulat￾ing lipids in humans.
An increasing body of work indicates that β cell responses to 
GLP-1 are altered during T2DM in both lean and obese individu￾als (22–24, 51), changes further compounded by the inheritance of 
T2DM risk alleles (52). Direct evidence that lipotoxicity represents 
a primary step in reducing the sensitivity of pancreatic β cells to 
GLP-1 in human subjects has, however, been difficult to obtain, 
given the effects of lipotoxicity to raise circulating glucose levels 
and to decrease GLP-1 secretion from the gut (53). Our results, 
based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses, strongly suggest that 
lipotoxicity may impair β cell responses to both GLP-1 and GIP 
independently of glucotoxicity. The current findings also corrob￾orate recent in vivo studies in which the incretin effect was found 
to be attenuated in obese individuals with normal glucose toler￾ance and GLP-1 output (25). Thus, diminished incretin sensitivity

is likely to represent an early event in T2DM pathogenesis in obese 
individuals, contributing to, rather than being a consequence of, 
more widespread β cell dysfunction.
The deleterious effects of FFAs on the islet dynamics 
underlying insulin release appear to be manifested through 
PKA- and cAMP-dependent inhibition of cell-cell GJ cou￾pling. While our data suggest that lipotoxicity provokes a 
seemingly paradoxical reduction in cAMP and an elevation 
in PKA, this should be considered in light of the complex￾ities inherent in this Gs subunit–operated signaling cas￾cade (54). For example, palmitate may increase PKA activ￾ity through an AC isoform distinct from those upregulated 
by forskolin, chronic FFA-induced increases in cAMP/PKA 
may not reflect the suppression of maximal forskolin-mediated 
AC stimulation, and lipids can activate PKA via cAMP-indepen￾dent pathways including those mediated by sphingosine accumu￾lation (55–57). Nevertheless, given that GLP-1 and GIP engage 
cAMP, a messenger shown to acutely improve electrical transfers 
between β cells (45), and given that Ca2+ responses to forskolin 
were blunted by palmitate exposure in our experiments, it is rea￾sonable to hypothesize that FFAs may target the islet dynamics 
underlying ISIS with two interrelated modes of action: impair￾ment of GJ communications via a chronic effect of PKA on Cx36 
protein expression (44), and inhibition of the augmented electro￾tonic coupling observed in response to fleeting challenge with 
cAMP-elevating ligands such as GLP-1 (45). Further functional 
dissection of the exact mechanisms involved will require the use 
of cAMP-monitoring recombinant probes that can be adapted 
for cell-specific expression throughout intact human islets (58).
Demonstrating a predilection for the cell-cell interactions 
involved in incretin action, FFA treatment did not similarly influ￾ence responses to glucose or other stimuli. Whereas tolbutamide 
and carbachol coordinated cell activity, presumably through mass 
depolarization of the islet syncytium, their actions were unaffected 
by either palmitate or GJ blockade. This observation suggests that 
the heterogeneity of GLP-1R expression, the second messenger 
characteristics, and the degree of connexin impairment all con￾tribute to the GJ dependency of the incretin. The finding that FFAs 
reduce GSIS may therefore stem from summation at the single￾cell level of the dissociation of membrane-proximate Ca2+ hotspots 
from exocytosis (59, 60), rather than any effects on global [Ca2+]i
and/or islet synchrony.

Although we used chiefly lipotoxic conditions throughout the 
present study, it remains to be determined whether “glucolipo￾toxic” conditions (i.e., elevated glucose and fatty acids) (40, 41) 
exert similar or more severe effects on connectivity. In any case, 
the mechanisms by which (gluco)lipotoxicity impacts the genes 
involved in β cell-β cell communication such as Cx36 are still 
largely obscure, but may involve enhanced peroxisomal fatty acid 
oxidation, production of ROS, and repression of cAMP-response 
elements (44, 61).
We asked whether the incretin-regulated changes in β cell coop￾erativity we observed in human islets might also be present in 
rodent systems, and thus ultimately be amenable to more straight￾forward physiological and genetic dissection. β cells within mouse 
islets are arranged into “small-world” networks and, in response 
to glucose, display explosive increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels that 
rhythmically spread throughout the population as autoregenera￾tive oscillatory wavefronts (62–64). Since these activity dynamics 
underlie insulin secretion, as inferred from animal models present￾ing with disorganized cell activity (36, 37, 46), attention has been 
focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the intraislet 
regulation of β cell function in the rodent setting. However, β cells 
residing within human islets behave in a more stochastic man￾ner, with coordination present only in small cell ensembles and 
no apparent large-scale synchrony when viewed at the population 
level (27, 34). Although human islets possess differing paracrine 
and neural regulation of intercellular communication (29, 30), 
similarities to their murine counterparts nonetheless exist, such 
as β cell–specific expression of Cx36 and the extent of β cell dye 
coupling (35). The current finding that incretin responses in intact 
human islets display marked GJ dependency therefore raises the 
intriguing possibility that insulin secretion from human islets is 
more reliant on an enhancement of coordinated β cell activity by 
non-sugar secretagogues. Indeed, mice consume small, frequent 
meals, particularly after lights out, whereas food intake in humans 
is strongly entrained to the light phase, when it occurs as 3 to 
4 meals (65). Thus, an evolutionarily advantageous link between 
blood glucose levels and food intake may be imprinted on human 
islets in the form of phylogenetic differences in the mechanisms 
that regulate incretin responsiveness.
Of note was the observation that obese mice possessed glu￾cose and incretin responses similar to those seen in human islets, 
since the maintenance of mice on an HFD perturbed coordinated 
responses to glucose that could be rescued by GLP-1 applica￾tion. Lipids mildly reduced Cx36 expression in these animals, so 
the restorative effect of GLP-1 on cell-cell communications may 
stem from either continued transmission through the remaining 
GJs, or upregulation of GJ-independent signaling mechanisms 
(see ref. 66 for a discussion of possible mechanisms). Conse￾quently, rather than representing a paradigm of exposure to excess 
FFAs, hypertrophied islets from HFD-fed animals may instead 
more closely model the default human scenario, albeit with subtle 
differences in the structural and functional regulation of ISIS (26). 
These species-specific differences may reflect diet-adapted strate￾gies to maintain normoglycemia in the face of nutrient oversupply, 
since the proportion of energy intake attributable to fat is almost 
two-fold lower in mice than in humans (~13% [1] versus 25% 
[7] fat [saturated fat]).
Conversely to our findings in human islets, palmitate has been 
shown to subtly downregulate receptor mRNA expression in iso￾lated mouse islets (67), although this did not appear to alter the 
fold change in ISIS. Of interest, an endogenous GLP-1 system has 
recently been reported in human islets, and tissue isolated from 
T2DM donors displayed upregulated incretin release (68). Con￾sistent with the latter finding, increased GLP-1R expression may 
therefore represent a compensatory mechanism to maintain ISIS 
in the face of compromised GSIS in humans. While these data fur￾ther underscore the species divergence in incretin signaling, over￾interpretation should be avoided in the absence of GLP-1R quan￾tification by Western blotting, an approach currently precluded 
by the lack of specific antibodies against either mouse or human 
receptor epitopes (69).
In summary, these results characterize a new aspect of human 
islet behavior involved in the normal responsiveness to secre￾tagogues and a likely contributor to insulin secretory failure in 
T2DM. Since reduced GLP-1–stimulated insulin secretion is a fea￾ture of T2DM associated with both obesity and risk alleles (22, 25, 
52), changes in incretin-regulated β cell cooperativity, which we 
describe here, may provide a unifying mechanism through which 
multiple factors such as lifestyle and genes can impact insulin 
release to reduce β cell function in humans.
Methods
Animal studies. Animals were maintained in a pathogen-free facility under 
a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with free access to water and food. 
For the HFD treatment, 8-week-old C57/BL6 mice were placed on chow 
containing 60% wt/wt fat content (Lillico Biotechnology). At 15 weeks of 
feeding, the animals were starved overnight before being subjected to an 
intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) (1g/kg D-glucose) to con￾firm the efficacy of the HFD in promoting glucose intolerance.
Cell culture. Human islets obtained from normoglycemic donors at iso￾lation centers in Oxford, Geneva, Milan, and Pisa were cultured in RPMI 
supplemented with 5.5 mM D-glucose, 10% FCS, 100 U penicillin, 100 μg 
streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/μl fungizone (37°C, 5% CO2). Islets were treated 
for 72 hours with either control (BSA plus NaOH), 0.5 mM BSA-conju￾Figure 8

or goat anti-guinea pig Alexa 568, both 1:500; Invitrogen), and mounted 
on Superfrost slides (Fisher Scientific) using Vectashield DAPI-contain￾ing mounting medium (Vector Labs). For Cx36 staining, an identical 
protocol was used, except that islets were fixed and permeabilized for 
3 minutes using acetone before incubation with primary (rabbit anti￾Cx36, 1:50) and secondary (donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488, 1:500) antibod￾ies (both from Invitrogen).
Fluorophores were excited using a high-magnification objective 
(63×/1.4 NA, Plan-Apochromat DIC; Zeiss) and 491-nm and 561-nm 
laser lines in single-track mode. DAPI was visualized at 359 nm using the 
epifluorescent port of the microscope. In all cases, emitted signals were 
detected using filters centered on 480/40 nm, 535/30 nm, and 630/75 nm 
for DAPI, Alexa 488, and Alexa 568, respectively. The α/β cell ratio was 
determined by subjecting the resulting images to automated threshold￾ing (threshold plugin for ImageJ software) and dividing the α cell area by 
the β cell area. Similarly, the fraction area occupied by Cx36 was calcu￾lated by dividing the threshold-corrected Cx36 immunopositive area by 
the total image area. Uniform linear adjustments were applied to contrast 
and brightness to improve image quality for analysis and presentation 
purposes, while preserving the pixel dynamic range and the intersample 
intensity differences.
Synthesis and validation of exendin-4 FITC. An exendin-4 FITC (on K12) 
peptide was custom synthesized according to the following sequence: 
HGEGTFTSDLSK(FITC)QMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS 
(GenicBio Limited). C57/BL6 mice were injected i.v. with 8 nmol/200 
μl of the peptide, sacrificed 1 hour after injection with a lethal dose 
of pentobarbital, and immediately perfused via the left ventricle with 
4% PFA. The pancreas was then cryosectioned and immunolabeled for 
insulin (guinea pig anti-insulin Igs, 1:200; Ventrex), glucagon (mouse 
anti-glucagon Igs, 1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich), and FITC to enhance the 
exendin signal (rabbit anti-FITC Igs, 1:100; Invitrogen). The secondary 
antibodies used were anti-guinea pig Igs coupled to Dylight 405 (1:800; 
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), anti-mouse Igs coupled to 
TRITC (1:500; SouthernBiotech), and anti-rabbit Igs coupled to Alexa 
488 (1:500; Invitrogen) for insulin, glucagon, and exendin, respec￾tively. To estimate the GLP-1R number at the cell surface in human 
islets, 100 nM exendin-4 FITC diluted in PBS was applied for 1 hour 
at 4°C (to minimize internalization) before rinsing and processing for 
immunohistochemistry. To assess total GLP-1R binding, islets were per￾meabilized with 1.5 mM Triton X-100 before application of exendin-4 
FITC. Specificity was verified by preincubating islets for 10 minutes 
with excess 1 μM GLP-1.
Lentiviral delivery of shRNA. Commercially validated lentiviral parti￾cles carrying shRNA expression constructs against human GJD2 were 
acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (NM_020660; clone IDs: TRCN000074089, 
TRCN000074092, TRCN0000413941, and TRCN000436198). MOI was 
calculated using Turbo-GFP particles (Sigma-Aldrich). Specificity of GJD2
gene silencing was confirmed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In all cases, 
nontargeting lentiviral particles containing scrambled shRNA were used as 
negative controls (Sigma-Aldrich).
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent and reverse 
transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (both from 
Invitrogen). The relative mRNA abundance was quantified by qPCR using 
SYBR Green Master Mix and a 7500 fast real-time PCR engine (both from 
Invitrogen). Primers (Supplemental Table 2) were designed not to span 
genomic DNA sequences using PerlPrimer. Specificity was validated using a 
dissociation curve, and linear amplification of both target and housekeeping 
genes was tested using a dilution series. The expression of each gene was nor￾malized to cylcophilin A (Ppia), and relative changes in mRNA expression ver￾sus control were calculated using the comparative Ct method (2–[delta][delta]Ct).
gated palmitate or 0.5 mM BSA-conjugated palmitate plus 10 μM H89 
(PKA inhibitor; Tocris). For the GJ inhibition studies, islets were pre￾incubated for 1 hour with AGA or its inactive analog BGA (both 20 μM; 
Sigma-Aldrich) before imaging. Studies have shown this dose to effectively 
disrupt GJ signaling in intact islets (70). Mice were euthanized by cervical 
dislocation, and pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion (71). 
Islets were cultured for 24 to 48 hours as above, but in RPMI supplemented 
with 11 mM instead of 5.5 mM glucose, and containing no fungizone.
Calcium imaging. Isolated islets were incubated (37°C, 95% O2/5% CO2) 
for 30 minutes in fluo-2-AM (10 μM) diluted with a mixture of DMSO 
(0.01%, wt/vol) and pluronic acid (0.001%, wt/vol; all from Invitrogen) 
in a bicarbonate buffer solution (120 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.25 mM 
NaH2PO4, 24 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 3 mM
D-glucose). Following acclimatization to the indicated glucose concentra￾tion, islets were placed on glass coverslips in a custom-manufactured alu￾minum chamber (Digital Pixel) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert coupled to a 
Nipkow spinning-disk head (Yokogawa CSU-10) and equipped with objec￾tives adjusted for chromatic aberration (10×–20×/0.3–0.5 NA, EC Plan￾Neofluar; Zeiss). Whole-islet multicellular Ca2+ imaging was performed as 
previously described (31). Briefly, Ca2+ dynamics were captured with cel￾lular resolution from the 50–200 fluo-2–loaded cells residing within the 
first and second layers of the intact islets. Use of a spinning disk to rapidly 
scan large areas of the islet allowed events to be recorded for long periods 
with minimal phototoxicity. A solid-state laser (CrystaLaser) controlled by 
a laser-merge module (Spectral Applied Physics) provided wavelengths of 
491 nm to excite fluo-2 (rate = 0.5Hz; exposure time = 263 ms). Emitted 
light was filtered at 525/50 nm, and images were captured by a highly sen￾sitive 16-bit, 512 × 512 pixel back-illuminated EM-CCD camera (ImageEM 
9100-13; Hamamatsu). Volocity software (PerkinElmer) provided the user 
interface. During recording, islets were maintained at 35°C to 36°C and 
continuously irrigated with bicarbonate buffer aerated with 95% O2/5% 
CO2. GLP-1 (7-36 human amide fragment), tolbutamide, forskolin, carba￾chol, AGA, BGA (all from Sigma-Aldrich), GIP (human), and exendin 9-39 
(both from Bachem) were delivered via the perfusion system at the doses 
indicated in the figures and accompanying legends.
Real-time imaging of insulin release. Insulin release was monitored using 
ZIMIR as previously described (39). Briefly, before imaging, islets were 
incubated for 2 hours in ZIMIR (1 mM), a membrane-bound probe that 
fluoresces upon binding of zinc (Zn2+) coreleased with insulin from gran￾ules. During recording, islets were irrigated with bicarbonate buffer con￾taining 1 μM EGTA to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without 
affecting intracellular Ca2+ or Zn2+ concentrations (39). Excitation was 
delivered at 491 nm (rate = 0.2 Hz; exposure = 1 second), and emitted sig￾nals were collected at 525/50 nm. Islets were arbitrarily subdivided into 
10 to 20 regions, and the normalized (F/Fmin) intensity over time was 
calculated for each region. Islet-wide insulin release dynamics were then 
represented by the mean intensity over time and the AUC, calculated by 
ignoring peaks less than 20% of the distance from minimum-to-maximum 
y to account for fluctuations in the baseline due to the SNR.
Insulin secretion assays. Six human islets were incubated in duplicate for 
30 minutes in 1 ml of Krebs-HEPES-bicarbonate (KHB) solution (130 mM 
NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM 
NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.1 % [wt/vol] BSA, pH 7.4) at 37°C containing 
the indicated glucose and GLP-1 concentrations. A specific RIA for human 
insulin (Millipore) was used to measure hormone released into the medium.
Immunohistochemistry. Islets were fixed overnight at 4°C in PFA (4%, wt/vol) 
before the application of primary antibodies (1:1,000 mouse antigluca￾gon or 1:200 guinea pig anti-insulin; both from DAKO). Following over￾night incubation at 4°C, islets were washed, incubated for 2 hours at 
room temperature with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488

tributed data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test or one-way 
ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni’s post-hoc test (accounting for degrees 
of the freedom). Between-treatment effects were assessed using two-way 
ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. Linear correlations 
were calculated using regression analyses. Analysis was performed using 
R, GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software), IgorPro, and MATLAB (Math￾Works). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and values rep￾resent the mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Western immunoblotting. Islets were washed in ice-cold PBS before lysis in 
precipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% 
nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and sonication. Total 
protein extracts were resolved using a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (12% Tris-acryl￾amide), wet transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and subjected to immu￾noblotting using either rabbit anti-Cx36 (1:50; Invitrogen) or mouse 
monoclonal antitubulin (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich clone B-5-1-2). Revela￾tion was performed using HRP-linked anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000; 
GE Healthcare) and a proprietary ECL detection reagent.
Live/dead assay. Islets were incubated for 15 minutes in PBS contain￾ing 3 μM calcein AM (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μM propidium iodide (PI) 
(Sigma-Aldrich) before detection of absorbance/emission at 491/525 nm 
and 561/620 nm, respectively. The islet area occupied by dead cells (PI) 
was calculated and expressed as a unitary ratio versus that occupied by live 
cells (calcein).
Correlation analysis. Correlation analyses were performed using a Pearson 
R coefficient as previously detailed (72). Briefly, individual fluo-2–loaded 
cells were identified using a region of interest (ROI), and intensity over time 
traces and Cartesian (x-y) coordinates were extracted. The resulting datasets 
were imported into R (R project, R Development Core Team) and IgorPro 
(Wavemetrics), baseline trends were removed by fitting a linear equation, 
and intensity values were normalized. GLP-1–responsive cells were man￾ually filtered on the basis of a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i levels above a 10% 
threshold to account for SNR. Subsequent to this, the one-sided correlation 
function between all possible cell pair combinations (excluding the auto￾correlation) was assessed using the Pearson’s product moment correlation 
defined by Equation 1, where x and y represent cells 1 and 2, respectively.
(Equation 1)
Significance (P < 0.05) was determined against the expected 
t distribution of independent R values (with two degrees of free￾dom). The location of significantly correlated cell pairs was dis￾played on a weighted graph constructed using the Cartesian (x-y) 
coordinates of each cell. Phase maps were compiled by converting 
the normalized intensity (minimum = 0; maximum = 100) of 
each cell to a color corresponding to a user-generated light-dark 
256-color ramp.
Frequency and duty cycle analysis. Ca2+-spiking frequency was measured as 
previously described (31). Briefly, power spectrums based on the fast Fou￾rier transform (FFT) were constructed for each cell, a confidence interval 
of 95% was imposed, and the frequency with the highest significant power 
was extracted. A histogram of frequency (mHz) was then plotted for each 
state. To assess the proportion of time spent in the “ON” phase, traces 
from each experiment were binarized using a 10% threshold and duty cycle 
(D), calculated using Equation 2, where τ and T represent the time spent in 
the active phase and total time, respectively. The mean D values were then 
compared between the different treatment states.
(Equation 2)
Statistics. In all cases, data distribution was determined using a D’Ago￾stino omnibus test. Non-Gaussian data were analyzed using either a 
Mann-Whitney U test or, where multiple comparisons were required, a 
Kruskal-Wallis test (followed by a Dunn’s post-hoc test). Normally dis-
