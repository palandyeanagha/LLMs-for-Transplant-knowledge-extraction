Abstract
Background Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures, remains associ￾ated with significant major morbidity including bile leak and bile duct injury (BDI). The effect of changes in practice over 
time, and of interventions to improve patient safety, on morbidity rates is not well understood. The aim of this review was to 
describe current incidence rates and trends for BDI and other complications during and after LC, and to identify risk factors 
and preventative measures associated with morbidity and BDI.
Methods PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science database searches and data extraction were conducted for studies which 
reported individual complications and complication rates following laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a representative popu￾lation. Outcomes data were pooled. Meta-regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with conversion, 
morbidity, and BDI rates.
Results One hundred and fifty-one studies reporting outcomes for 505,292 patients were included in the final quantitative syn￾thesis. Overall morbidity, BDI, and mortality rates were 1.6–5.3%, 0.32–0.52%, and 0.08–0.14%, respectively. Reported BDI 
rates reduced over time (1994–1999: 0.69(0.52–0.84)% versus 2010–2015 0.22(0.02–0.40)%, p=0.011). Meta-regression 
analysis suggested higher conversion rates in developed versus developing countries (4.7 vs. 3.4%), though a greater degree 
of reporting bias was present in these studies, with no other significant associations identified.
Conclusions Overall, trends suggest a reduction in BDI over time with unchanged morbidity and mortality rates. However, 
data and reporting are heterogenous. Establishment of international outcomes registries should be considered.
Keywords Cholecystectomy · Bile leak · Bile duct injury · Laparoscopy · Open · Outcomes
Laparoscopy has become the gold standard approach to chol￾ecystectomy since its introduction 30 years ago, and is one 
of the most commonly performed general surgical proce￾dures [1]. Despite the advantages of laparoscopy, however, 
up to a five-fold increase in rates of bile duct injury (BDI) 
was reported at the onset of the era of laparoscopic chol￾ecystectomy (LC) [2]. Relatively high rates of BDI continue 
to be conveyed, with individual reports ranging from 0.2 to 
1.5% [3–7] suggesting that little improvement in outcomes 
has occurred since the introduction of LC. This compares 
unfavorably to the era of open surgery, where BDI rates of 
0.1–0.2% were commonly accepted [2].
BDI has a substantial negative impact on patient survival, 
[8, 9] is associated with impaired quality of life, [10] and 
represents a major source of litigation cost in many modern 
health systems [11]. It, therefore, remains a critical goal to 
reduce rates of BDI, which still is the most feared complica￾tion of this common procedure conducted for benign disease.
The only previous study to analyze LC outcomes on a 
broad scale was an early review published in 1996 by Shea 
et al. [12] which pooled data for 78,747 patients from 98 
studies. They found an overall collective BDI rate that 
ranged from 0.36 to 0.47%.

which may predispose or prevent complications, is necessary 
if practice is to be improved.
The aims of this review are twofold: (1) to describe cur￾rent incidence and trends for BDI and other complications 
during and after LC, and (2) to identify risk factors and pre￾ventative measures associated with morbidity and BDI.
Methods
Search strategy
A systematic review was conducted in accordance with 
PRISMA guidelines for the reporting of systematic reviews 
and meta-analysis of observational studies [13]. PubMed, 
MEDLINE, and Web of Science database searches and 
data extraction were conducted from 1987 (first published 
report of laparoscopic cholecystectomy) to January 2015. 
The following search terms and MeSH headings were used 
and combined with AND operands: “cholecystectomy,” 
“morbidity,” “laparoscopy.” Following de-duplication, ini￾tial titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify articles 
of potential interest; these were then retrieved in full-text 
format for review and data extraction by three independent 
researchers. Any discrepancies during the search were dis￾cussed and revised until consensus was reached.
Selection criteria
Studies were included only if they reported detailed indi￾vidual complications and complication rates. Complications 
were recorded as defined by the individual study authors. 
An “all comers only” approach to inclusion in this review 
was applied, with the aim of including data representative of 
routine practice of LC (at time of publication) in the general 
population. As such, studies of select cohorts, such as analy￾ses of LC in acalculous cholecystitis or in geriatric popula￾tions, were excluded. Studies were required to include at 
least 100 subjects, and those explicitly describing early case 
experience or learning curves were not included to ensure 
that data were representative of an established practice. 
Reports where techniques other than conventional multi￾port LC (e.g., single incision; robotic) were described were 
included only if the technique reported represented standard 
practice for the reporting center or were reported within the 
context of a randomized trial. This approach was chosen to 
reduce the risk of selection bias from these studies. When 
two or more studies shared overlapping data sources, only 
one study was included according to the following prior￾itization criteria: (1) the most detailed relevant outcomes, 
(2) the largest patient population, and (3) the most recent 
dataset. Study, patient, procedure, and outcome variables 
were extracted.
Data analysis
Descriptive and outcomes data were pooled. Ranges were 
calculated for pooled major outcomes, taking into account 
that a lack of a reported outcome did not necessarily mean 
its absence. For these, either only studies that explicitly 
reported a given outcome (higher outcome range) were used, 
or alternatively, all studies were included and assumed a 0% 
rate for those that did not report the outcome in question 
(lower range, i.e., “best case scenario”), replicating prior 
methodology [12]. Unadjusted analysis of morbidity and 
BDI rates over time was conducted with studies grouped 
into 5-year intervals, based on the last reported year of data 
collection.
To identify underlying factors potentially associated with 
variation in LC outcomes across studies, meta-regression 
analysis was conducted for conversion, morbidity, and BDI 
rates, adjusting for the following co-variates: (1) data year 
(as represented by the latest year of included data), (2) coun￾try of origin (developed vs. developing country according 
to United Nations human development index classification 
[14]), (3) academic vs. non-academic center, (4) acute chol￾ecystectomy rate, (5) cholecystitis rate, (6) intraoperative 
cholangiogram rate, and (7) surgical technique (e.g., stand￾ard multi-port LC, single incision LC; each technique sepa￾rately coded).
Given the inclusion of several studies assessing interven￾tions to reduce BDI, secondary meta-analysis was performed 
for these papers, but was not included in the main text of 
this manuscript as the search strategy was not set up to cap￾ture these papers and large heterogeneity of data could be 
expected. Analysis was performed using Stata 12 (Stata￾Corp, Austin, TX), using metan and metareg commands.
Study quality assessment
Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale [15] for cohort studies, and the Cochrane Collabora￾tion’s Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for randomized trials 
[16]. Publication bias for BDI rates was assessed using fun￾nel plots with pseudo-confidence intervals,[17] and Egger’s 
test.
Results
Search results
A total of 12,848 search results were returned and screened 
for eligibility (Fig.  1). Following review of title and 
abstracts, full-text versions of 209 articles were retrieved 
and reviewed in full. Of these, 151 were included in the 

Surgical Endoscopy (2018) 32:2175–2183 2177

final qualitative and quantitative analysis (see appendix 1 
for full list).
A total of 505,292 patients were included in the 151 ana￾lyzed studies, which included 18 randomized trials (4549 
patients), 117 single center cohort studies (115,237 patients), 
and 35 multi-center cohort studies (385,506 patients), with a 
median of 435 patients per study [interquartile range (IQR) 
152–1353].
Pooled outcomes
BDI was divided into major bile duct injuries (as defined 
by individual authors) and bile leaks in 65 (43%) of stud￾ies, representing 170,059 patients. For these patients, overall 
reported prevalence of major injury was 0.28% and bile leak 
0.46%. The remaining studies reported BDI without indica￾tion of severity or anatomy. Overall, the pooled range for any 
biliary injury was 0.32–0.52%, with overall morbidity and 
mortality of 1.6–5.3 and 0.08–0.14%, respectively (Table 1). 
Overall pooled prevalences for individual complications are 
shown in Table 2.
Trends over time
Unadjusted analysis demonstrated a statistically signifi￾cant reduction in reported BDI from 0.69% (0.52–0.84) to 
0.22% (0.02–0.40) (mean and 95% confidence interval (CI)) 
(p=0.011) for the intervals 1994–1999 and 2010–2014, 
respectively. There was no statistically significant difference 
for conversion rates (pooled range 4.2–6.2%, p=0.269), or 
morbidity rates (1.6–5.3%, p=0.931) across time periods 
(Fig. 2).
Meta‑regression analysis
Multi-variate adjusted (meta-regression) analysis (Table 3) 
found few detectable differences in BDI or morbidity rates. 
For conversion rates, LC in developing countries were less 
likely to be converted to open (mean 3.4 vs. 4.7%, p=0.026).
Considering studies that assessed the effects of inter￾ventions on LC outcomes, reporting was heterogenous and 
quality of studies suitable for meta-analysis was poor. No 
more than two studies reported comparable outcomes for 
any given intervention, precluding any meaningful meta￾analysis or interpretation of results; these are, therefore, not 
further discussed in this paper, though results are included 
for completeness (see Appendix 2).
Study quality and bias
Overall quality of the included studies was moder￾ate. Newcastle-Ottawa scores for cohort studies were 
(mean±standard deviation) 6.2±1.0, range 4–9. Risk of 
bias for randomized trials using the Cochrane Collabo￾ration tool was generally low (Appendix 1). The rate of 
outcome reporting was highly variable and is reported in 
Table 4.
Publication bias for BDI rates using funnel plots and 
pseudo-confidence intervals are found in Figs. 3 and 4. 
Use of Egger’s test suggested statistically significant bias 
(bias coefficient 1.87 ± 0.34, p < 0.001). Bias risk for 
reported conversion rates was also assessed for devel￾oped (0.13 ± 1.02, p = 0.898) and developing countries 
(1.42±1.02, p=0.178) of origin.

Discussion
This review of outcomes for LC reconfirms the established 
principle that LC is safe and may be performed with mini￾mum morbidity (pooled prevalence range 1.6–5.3%) and 
mortality (0.08–0.14%). LC remains the unchallenged gold 
standard, with conversion rates between 4.2 and 6.2%.
BDI outcomes analysis was limited by the fact that BDI 
was not universally reported and different classifications 
were used (without any formalized correspondence as to 
the grading); we were, therefore, unable to segregate bile 
leaks according to severity or nature of injury. Our find￾ings, however, are consistent with recent Swedish popula￾tion analyses of over 51,000 LCs which reported a 0.3% 
major BDI rate, [18] with an overall 1.5% bile leak rate 
[7]. At 0.32%, the lower estimate of pooled BDI rate in 
our overall analysis remained higher than the commonly 
accepted rates of 0.1–0.2% for open cholecystectomy 
reported at the dawn of the laparoscopic era over a quarter 
century ago [2]. Unadjusted pooled outcomes in our study 
suggested a modest decrease in reported BDI rates over 
the past 30 years. However, this was not reflected in the 
meta-regression analysis. Regardless, with nearly 1 million 
cholecystectomies performed per year in the United States 
alone, [19] the medical, psychological, and socioeconomic 
burdens represented by BDI remain substantial. This con￾sideration is particularly true if one weighs it in the context 
of LC as an extremely common, and, by today’s standards, 
a typically outpatient or short stay procedure performed for 
benign disease. Furthermore, a large volume of performed 
LC are probably not included in any studies and their com￾plication rate may be higher than the ones presented here. 
Yamashita et al., for example, reported Japanese national 
survey data suggesting little change in BDI rates over the 
past decade, with a mean incidence of 0.66% [20].
Technological and technical efforts to improve LC quality 
continue. However, despite the growing number of meth￾ods intended to reduce BDI, the evidence for their ability 
to impact BDI rates remains limited. A 2011 systematic

review of interventions to prevent BDI identified a number 
of candidate techniques and procedures, including routine 
use of the critical view of safety approach and intraoperative 
cholangiography, but conclusive effects on BDI rates could 
not be shown [21]. In addition, series which have examined 
the mechanism of biliary injury have rarely described use of 
the critical view of safety as the method of ductal identifica￾tion [22, 23]. However, several large retrospective series in 
which the critical view of safety was used routinely have 
been reported with no biliary injuries [24, 25].
A major challenge for assessing factors associated with 
BDI risk is its relatively low prevalence (0.3–0.5%). A study 
assessing a procedure to reduce BDI rates would, for exam￾ple, require a sample size of 16,989 patients in each arm to

detect a 50% reduction of the BDI rates from 0.3% (assum￾ing a standard alpha=0.05 at 80% power). The logistical 
obstacles and confounders involved in a study of this size 
means such a trial is highly unlikely to take place. Moreover, 
the true prevalence of BDI is difficult to ascertain from the 
literature, as there is wide confusion between prevalence 
and incidences in reports. Instead, we must, therefore, rely 
on cohort, expert, and surrogate data, such as the ability to 
accurately demonstrate and identify biliary anatomy intra￾operatively, as is the aim with the critical view of safety, and 
other methods of ductal identification [26, 27]. Newer tech￾niques such as infrared fluorescence cholangiography are 
generating considerable interest as a way to enhance iden￾tification of the anatomy during cholecystectomy, but must 
be evaluated by further study in larger numbers of patients 
before any recommendations can be made [28].
In the present study, we assessed the effect of technical, 
patient, and hospital characteristics on BDI rates. These 
factors had few detectable associations with BDI rates. It 
is crucial, therefore, to recognize the role that education, 
decision-making, and experience have to play in preventing 
BDI during LC. A recent insurance database review study 
of BDI illustrated the effect of surgeon experience and vol￾ume, wherein younger, less experienced surgeons reported 
BDI rates three times higher than their more experienced 
counterparts [29]. A European-based population study has 
suggested that a positive volume–outcome relationship for 
LC exists with reference to outcomes other than BDI as well, 
with high volume centers (defined as >244 LC/year) report￾ing lower morbidity, mortality, and reoperation rates [30].
Data published by Way et al., [31] in which root causes 
of over 200 BDIs were identified, highlighted the fact that 
over 97% of errors were related to non-technical, predomi￾nantly perceptual errors. In response to this and other data, 
a recent international Delphi consensus study headed by the 
Society for American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons 
(SAGES) Safe Cholecystectomy Task Force identified the 
most important factors to safety in LC as (1) establishing 
the CVS, (2) understanding of anatomy, (3) adequate expo￾sure, (4) ability to call a senior colleague for help, and (5) 
recognizing when to convert or abandon [32]. Education 
and practice, the group recommended, should be focused 
around these key principles, with technical factors such as 
choice of dissection tool, duct securing technique, or use of 
cholangiography ranking lower in priority.
This review and its conclusions are subject to several 
limitations. As discussed, we had limited statistical power 
to identify differences in BDI rates by a range of factors 
because of its relatively low prevalence and/or incidence 
rates. Secondly, we imposed minimum sample sizes to 
reduce the risk of selection bias from smaller studies. This 
approach may have had the effect of excluding studies that 
might otherwise have been included in secondary out￾come analyses, and meant that no more than two studies 
were available for analysis of each assessed intervention. 
It was, however, our expressed aim to focus on BDI and 
complication rates and numerous other reviews (including 
those already cited) for individual interventions and second￾ary outcomes exist which incorporated smaller studies not 
included here. The ranges reported here for pooled outcomes 
reflect the inconsistency of data reporting, even for large￾scale studies focused on outcomes for LC. For the lower 
range, assuming a 0% prevalence or incidence for studies 
which did not report a given outcome will invariably under￾estimate the pooled rate as it combines studies which did not 
report prevalence/incidence due to a true 0% rate, with those 
with incomplete outcomes reporting. Interpretation of our 
findings must take this aspect into account.
In addition, it is almost certain that many BDI are neither 
reported nor published except for national database report￾ing requirements such as in Sweden, and therefore, the true 
prevalence/incidence of BDI in most of the world is not

precisely known and may be higher than identified herein. 
Administrative databases accounted for a large proportion of 
the retrospective studies included here; their advantageous 
large numbers are tempered by the fact that they likely lack 
detailed coding with reference to prevalence/incidence of 
BDI, and do not allow differentiation between types of 
injury. Further, if BDIs are recorded without severity, based 
on reoperation (hepaticojejunostomy) alone, this surrogate 
endpoint presents the dual problem of skewing injuries to the 
severe end of the scale, as well as underestimating overall 
injury rates—potentially accounting in part for the apparent 
reduction observed in our pooling of recent data of BDI.
Although our inclusion criteria aimed to maintain high 
overall study quality, the thoroughness of outcomes report￾ing was highly variable. In many cases, the quality of report￾ing in recent literature was worse than 20 years ago; dura￾tion of stay and morbidity were reported for 49 and 52% of 
studies included, respectively, compared to 82 and 98% in 
the previous 1996 analysis by Shea et al. [12]. This finding 
highlights the need for standardized reporting of outcomes 
for these procedures [33]. Finally, analysis of funnel plots 
suggested significant publication bias. This finding poten￾tially also accounts for the differences seen in conversion 
rates between developed and developing countries, with a 
much higher bias coefficient seen in developing countries.
Future advances to improve outcomes in LC will need 
to consider technological, educational, and structural 
approaches. Technological developments offer new tech￾niques for the identification of biliary anatomy but have 
limited evidence demonstrating their effectiveness. Though 
some show promise, it is unlikely that interventions will be 
able to detect an effect on BDI within the context of a ran￾domized trial due to limitations of sample size. It is incum￾bent upon researchers, therefore, to identify and focus on 
selected surrogate outcome measures, and particularly to 
ensure the standardization of reporting, for example includ￾ing complications, BDI, and ductal injury type, which con￾tinues to elude LC-related research. The establishment of 
international registries should be prioritized.
Education, training, and mentorship, with emphasis on 
techniques such as the critical view of safety, will continue 
to be the mainstay of surgical expertise. Modern teaching 
paradigms have enhanced educators’ understanding of the 
often unconsciously carried knowledge which constitutes 
surgical expertise, with teaching frameworks designed to 
reveal and convey these to learners [34]. Aided by techno￾logical teaching adjuncts, including virtual reality and box 
trainers, these have the potential to accelerate improvement 
and abbreviate learning curves [35]. The technology, train￾ing, and expertise required for LC, coupled with the severity 
of BDI as a potential complication, calls for a reassessment 
of how LC is taught and what educational strategies could 
be used to impact this problem.
Conclusions
This extensive systematic review and pooled data analy￾sis summarizes the current body of knowledge relating to 
outcomes following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It could 
represent a useful benchmark against which clinicians and 
health systems may measure outcomes, with which patients 
may weigh the risks of surgery, and against which research￾ers may assess their data reporting.
No definitive intervention to reduce BDI rates was identi￾fied, which likely reflects the limitations of the data reported 
in these various studies. Overall, we report marginal, if any, 
reductions in the rate of reported BDI. Pooled rates for BDI 
after LC remain higher than during the era of open chol￾ecystectomy. Given the high prevalence of cholecystectomy, 
thousands of patients per year continue to sustain BDI, with 
severe and long-term implications for their health, under￾scoring once again the need to continue research in this field, 
and to inform and educate young surgeons concerning the 
risk and consequences of BDI during LC.
