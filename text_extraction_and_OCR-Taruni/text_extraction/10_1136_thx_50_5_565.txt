Abstract
BACKGROUND-- Bilateral sequential lung transplantation (BSLT)
has been widely adopted as an alternative to combined heart and
lung transplantation for the management of end stage septic lung
disease in many transplant centres. METHODS-- A retrospective
review was undertaken of the first 32 consecutive patients with
septic lung disease to undergo BSLT at the Freeman Hospital.
RESULTS-- Between April 1988 and October 1994 32 patients
underwent BSLT. Survival at 30 days was 85% and actuarial
survival at one year was 70%. Improved pulmonary function was
seen in all surviving patients. CONCLUSION-- BSLT for septic lung
disease offers comparable survival to heart-lung transplantation,
with excellent functional results. Long term results may be superior
because the disadvantages of transplanting the heart are avoided.
