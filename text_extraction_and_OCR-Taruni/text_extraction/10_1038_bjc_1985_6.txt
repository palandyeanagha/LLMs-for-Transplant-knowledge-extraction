Abstract
Various immunization assays were used to demonstrate the lack of
immunogenicity of three BALB/c tumours of spontaneous origin
and of a fourth one resulting from foreign body tumorigenesis. All
four tumours inhibited the growth of a second implant of the same
tumour into the contralateral flank. In our tumour models
“concomitant immunity” (1) was not mediated by macrophage or T-
cell dependent immune reactions: both thymectomized BALB/c and
nude mice (treated or untreated with silica) gave the same results as
intact mice; (2) showed some degree of non-specificity, inhibiting
the growth of a different tumour in 3/4 cases; though, the existence
of a specific component could not be discarded; (3) was
proportional to the volume of the primary tumour at the time of the


second challenge; (4) was dependent on actively growing primary
tumour, not being obtained with progressively increasing daily
inocula of irradiated tumour cells; (5) was detectable in an actively
growing secondary tumour; recurrent growth after partial surgical
excision was inhibited and (6) involved cytostasis of the secondary
tumour: a syngeneic graft of the overlying skin led to tumour
growth while histological studies revealed the presence of viable
tumour cells. It is postulated that “concomitant immunity” or
resistance can be generated without the active participation of the
immune system and that tumour-related factors are, in certain
cases, responsible for blocking the growth of secondary tumours.
