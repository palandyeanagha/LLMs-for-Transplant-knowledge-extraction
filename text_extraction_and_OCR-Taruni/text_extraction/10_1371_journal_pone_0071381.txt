Abstract
Target exon resequencing using Massively Parallel DNA Sequencing (MPS) is a new powerful strategy to discover causative
genes in rare Mendelian disorders such as deafness. We attempted to identify genomic variations responsible for deafness
by massive sequencing of the exons of 112 target candidate genes. By the analysis of 216randomly selected Japanese
deafness patients (120 early-onset and 96 late-detected), who had already been evaluated for common genes/mutations by
Invader assay and of which 48 had already been diagnosed, we efficiently identified causative mutations and/or mutation
candidates in 57 genes. Approximately 86.6% (187/216) of the patients had at least one mutation. Of the 187 patients, in 69
the etiology of the hearing loss was completely explained. To determine which genes have the greatest impact on deafness
etiology, the number of mutations was counted, showing that those in GJB2 were exceptionally higher, followed by
mutations in SLC26A4, USH2A, GPR98, MYO15A, COL4A5 and CDH23. The present data suggested that targeted exon
sequencing of selected genes using the MPS technology followed by the appropriate filtering algorithm will be able to
identify rare responsible genes including new candidate genes for individual patients with deafness, and improve molecular
diagnosis. In addition, using a large number of patients, the present study clarified the molecular epidemiology of deafness
in Japanese. GJB2 is the most prevalent causative gene, and the major (commonly found) gene mutations cause 30–40% of
deafness while the remainder of hearing loss is the result of various rare genes/mutations that have been difficult to
diagnose by the conventional one-by-one approach. In conclusion, target exon resequencing using MPS technology is a
suitable method to discover common and rare causative genes for a highly heterogeneous monogenic disease like hearing
loss.

Introduction
Etiological studies have shown that approximately two-thirds of
congenital/early-onset sensorineural hearing loss in developed
countries is estimated to be due to genetic causes [1]. Deafness is
an extremely heterogenous disorder and the involvement of nearly
60 distinct nonsyndromic deafness genes sometimes makes the
precise diagnosis difficult. To clarify individual etiology in such
heterogenous diseases, one-by-one gene screening based on
conventional PCR-based direct sequencing of candidate genes
has been developed, and currently GJB2 has become the first to be
screened, followed by several commonly encountered genes. As
more comprehensive screening methods, micorarray-based screen￾ing [2,3] and Invader assay-based screening [4,5] have also been
developed. Recent advances in exome sequencing using Massively
Parallel DNA Sequencing (MPS) have revolutionized the elucida￾tion of genetic defects causing monogenic disorders [6–8]. A
number of papers regarding gene discovery and successful clinical
application for identification of responsible genes for deafness
using MPS have recently been published [9–17]. In this study, we
have chosen 112 genes (including 54 known deafness causing
genes, 22 known syndromic hearing loss causing genes and 36
possible candidate genes which expressed highly in the inner ear)
and conducted genetic analysis to 1) confirm the potentiality of
MPS -based genetic screening strategies for such a genetically
heterogenous disease, and 2) clarify molecular epidemiology by
identifying responsible/candidate genes in a large number of
patients using MPS technology.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Two hundred sixteen Japanese patients with bilateral sensori￾neural hearing loss from 33 ENT departments nationwide
participated in the present study. With regard to onset age (the
age of awareness), 120 patients had early-onset deafness (below 6
y.o.), and 96 had late-detected deafness. Thirty subjects were from
autosomal dominant or mitochondrial inherited families (two or
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71381

more generations affected); 98 subjects were from autosomal
recessive families (parents with normal hearing and two or more
affected siblings) or had sporadic deafness (also compatible with
recessive inheritance or non-genetic hearing loss). Hearing loss was
evaluated using pure-tone audiometry (PTA) classified by a pure￾tone average over 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz in the better
hearing ears. For children who could not undergo PTA, we used
an average over 500, 1000, 2000 Hz in either auditory steady￾stem response (ASSR) or conditioned oriented reflex audiometry
(COR), or the response threshold (dB) from auditory brainstem
response (ABR). Computed tomography (CT) scans were per￾formed to check for congenital inner ear anomalies.
The patients had already been evaluated by conventional PCR￾based one-by-one gene screening and Invader-based multi-gene
screening [5], and 61 out of the 216 (45/120 prelingual, 16/96
postlingual) patients were already found to have GJB2 (n = 38),
SLC26A4 (n = 15), or mitochondrial 1555 (n = 3) and 3243 (n = 5)
mutations. We chose these patients because 1) they were
‘‘randomly’’ selected, and 2) they had already been screened by
Invader assay and further fully sequenced by Sanger sequencing
for the previously found common and frequent deafness causing
genes i.e., GJB2, SLC26A4, KCNQ4, and CDH23. Therefore, we
could simultaneously use these 216 samples for both diagnostic
purposes and for verification. As a control for pathogeneity of each
genomic variation, 72 Japanese samples were used in this study,
because they were 1) ethnically similar, 2) had normal hearing
evaluated by pure-tone audiometry, and 3) were collected from
throughout the nation, and were able to undergo identical
procedures. All subjects or next of kin, caretakers, or guardians
on the behalf of the minors/children gave prior written informed
consent for participation in the project, and the Shinshu
University Ethical Committee as well as the respective Ethical
Committees of the other participating institutions of the Deafness

Targeted Enrichment and DNA Sequencing
One hundred twelve genes listed in Table S1, including 54
genes reported to be causative of non-syndromic hearing loss
(Hereditary Hearing loss Homepage; http://
hereditaryhearingloss.org/) and 22 reported to cause syndromic
hearing loss were selected for sequencing. In hopes of finding novel
causative genes, we added 36 genes that are highly expressed in
the adult human inner ear by microarray analysis [18]. DNA from
12 patients was pooled and 3 mg of each pooled DNA was used as
an input material for SureSelect target DNA enrichment (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and Illumina GAIIx sequencing
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturers’
procedures. Each genomic DNA pool was fragmented using the
CovarisTM S2 System (Covaris, Woburn, MA) to about 200 bp
fragment length. After fragmentation, DNA fragments were blunt￾ended and phosphorylated at the 59 end using a Paired End
Genomic DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and successively,
adeninylated at the 39 end and ligated to pre-capture adaptor
olligonucleotides containing SureSelect target DNA enrichment
kit. After adaptor oligonucleotide ligation, pre-capture amplifica￾tion was performed with Heraculase II Fusion DNA polymerase
(Agilent Technologies). Between each step of sample preparation,
DNA pools were purified with the Agencourt AMPure XP system
(Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). The Capture library
was designed with Agilent’s eArray homepage (http://earray.
vhem.agilent.com/earray/). The bait cRNA library contained all
exons of 112 genes. Exons of selected genes of all variants were
selected from RefSeq and Ensembl databases using the University
of California Santa Cruz table browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/
). Adaptor ligated and pre-amplicated samples were hybridized to
the Capture cRNA library at 65uC for 24 hours with SureSelect
Hybridization buffer and successively captured with Dynabeads
MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Invitrogen) and washed with
SureSelect Wash buffer. After target capture, selected product
from pooled DNA was post-amplified with Heraculase II Fusion
DNA polymerase and Illumina Multiplexing Sample Preparation
Oligonucleotide Kit and then submitted to the massive parallel
sequencing in a lane on a Illumina GAIIx genome platform
(Illumina).
Mapping and Filtering
The sequence data were processed with standard Illumina base
calling procedure and successively mapped to human genome
sequence (build hg 36) with the Bowtie program and BWA
program [19,20]. The two programs were used consecutively,
because the Bowtie program cannot detect insertion/deletion
efficiently. A total of 55.4 and 8.5 Gb sequences with about
9,000,000 and 1,400,000 reads were obtained by the pair-end
method for the patients and the controls, respectively. After
alignment, the filtering algorithm shown in Fig. 1 was applied to
collect the responsible genes/mutations. First, because of usage of
pooled DNA samples, potential single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
were filtered by the frequency of variant reads at each position.
For the number of variants in each position, we assumed a
binomial distribution with the probability parameter of 1/24, and
the size parameter of the number of coverage. The largest integer
number that is not larger than the value giving the cumulative
distribution function of 0.025 of the binomial distribution was used
as the threshold value, and the position was selected when the
number of the reads of the variant were not lower than the
threshold value indicated in formula (1).

In the formula, n denotes total depth (wild type+mutation allele) of
each mapped position, j denotes the observed number of
mutational alleles at each mapped position, and p denotes the
relative frequency of the mutation allele in the pool. In this study
DNA of 12 patients was pooled, and the minimal positive value of
the relative frequency of the mutational allele in each pooled DNA
sample should be 1/24. Therefore, we employed p = 1/24. To
reduce false negative cases, we used P = 95% and after the
calculation of this formula, k value indicated the number of
minimal mutation allele copies that was used as the threshold for
each mapped position. We fixed p = 1/24 and P = 95%, and then,
k value was dependent only on the total depth n.

When compared with the mutations already identified by
Sanger sequencing, this first filtering was effective to detect those
mutations (Fig. S1).
After the first filtering, the selected SNVs were then classified
into the targeted regions (coding region, non-coding region,
splicing junction) and types of changes (nonsense mutation,
missense mutation, insertion or deletion) (Fig. 1). SNVs were
then filtered against the sequences observed at over 1% in control
subjects because most common GJB2 deafness causing mutations
so far found in Japanese had shown ,1% allele frequencies in the
control population (Fig. S2). Then, the minimum cut off value for
the depth was decided to be 230 for each 12-patient pool, based on
the data obtained for all exons of the GJB2, CDH23, and KCNQ4
genes by Sanger sequencing and parallel sequencing (Fig. S2).
For splice-site mutations, 24 possible candidates for causative
mutations were selected because SNVs within +/22base from the
exon-intron junction site were considered to be important for
splicing [21,22]. After the application of all these filters, the
candidate deafness causing mutations were selected, and verified
by the subsequent Sanger sequencing. For missense mutations, the
Polyphen2 [23] software program was applied to predict the
influence on the protein structure by amino acid substitution.
Family member genotypes were also used to validate the co￾segregations of the deafness trait and the candidate mutations in
individual families.
Comparison with Another Algorithm for Pooled DNA
Samples
We also analyzed all the data with VIPR, a program established
and validated for use with pooled samples [24].
Results
Of 7 selected nonsense mutations, after Sanger sequencing, 2
were not confirmed but 5 actual nonsense mutations in 12 families
were identified in GJB2, EYA1, MIA, TMPRSS3, and MYO6
(Table S2, Fig. 2).
Of 24 selected splice-site mutations, after Sanger sequencing, 22
were not identified but 2 actual splice-site mutations in 3 families
were successfully identified in KCNQ1 and SLC26A4 (Table S2,
Fig. 3). The pathogenic nature was confirmed by 1) segregation
within the family and 2) phenotypic configuration (long-QT for
KCNQ1 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct for SLC26A4).
Of 27 selected insertion-deletion mutations, after Sanger
sequencing, 6 actual mutations in 48 families were successfully
identified in GJB2, MYO15A and MYH9 (Table S2, Fig. 4).

Of 622 missense mutations, 254 mutations were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. By using PolyPhen2 software, 167 were
classified as ‘‘damaging’’ or ‘‘probably damaging’’ or ‘‘possibly
damaging’’ and 87 were categorized as ‘‘benign’’ (Table S2). Of
167 selected missense mutations 163 were ,1% allele frequencies
in both the 1000 genome project (http://www.1000genomes.org/
node/home) and the NHLB grand opportunity exome sequencing
project: 6500 exomes (http://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/).
TMPRSS3, MYO15A, GJB2, SLC26A4 were found to be respon￾sible for deafness in autosomal recessive or sporadic families.
Examples of the families are shown in Fig. 5, 6. TECTA, WFS-1,
MYH9, EYA1, COL4A5, COL11A1 were identified as the
responsible genes for deafness in autosomal dominant families
(Fig. 5, 6).
As in Table S2, a total of 57 responsible genes were found, and
the number of mutations/mutation candidates is shown in Fig. 1.
GJB2 was exceptionally higher, followed by SLC26A4, USH2A,
GPR98, MYO15A, COL4A5, and CDH23. In the early-onset group,
GJB2, SLC26A4, GPR98, MYO15A, USH2A, CDH23, and TECTA
were frequently found, in contrast to the late-detected group,
where GJB2, COL4A5, USH2A, MYO15A, CDH23, GPR98, EYA1,
and TMPRSS3 were frequently found (Fig. 7). The number of
possible mutations in the early-onset group vs. late-detected group
was 54:22 for GJB2, 7:1 for PCDH15, 8:3 for SLC26A4, 18:2 for
TECTA, and 3:5 for TMPRSS3.
Comparison data between the current algorithm and VIPR,
which is widely used for pooled sample analysis due to its higher
specificity in mutation detection compared to other programs for
pooled samples, is shown in Table S3. VIPR is unable to detect

deletion/insertion mutations, as well as some missense mutations.
93.5% (87/93) and 84.1% (37/44) of the mutations were detected
in the GJB2 and SLC26A4 genes that had already been fully
sequenced by Sanger sequencing, respectively.
Discussion
With regard to sensitivity and specificity, we placed priority on
sensitivity because one of the main purposes was clarifying genetic
epidemiology. In addition, we used pooled DNA samples because
a large number of sample is needed for genetic epidemiology. With
the cut off value setting in this study, we could obtain high
sensitivity (93.5% sensitivity on the basis of GJB2, SLC26A4)(Fig.
S1). We also analyzed all the data with VIPR, a program
established and validated for use with pooled samples [24].
However, sensitivity (84.1%) was not as satisfactory as the current
algorithm (Table S3). Also, because VIPR is unable to detect
deletion/insertion mutations, we used our own algorithm in this
study.
On the other hand, it is also true that one problem of the
present algorithm is low specificity (high false positive rates: 16%
for nonsense, 90% for splice-site, 75% for insertion-deletion
mutations and 67% for missense mutations) necessitating time￾consuming direct sequencing confirmation afterwards and making
it unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. The low specificity was
improved by using a more stringent cut off line in the minimum
depth of coverage as well as a more stringent p-value in the
binomial distribution filtering process. But for diagnosis, more
sophisticated methods and algorithms with higher specificity such
as bar-code procedures are available for genetic testing for
individual patients.
With regard to five nonsense mutations in 12 families (identified
in GJB2, EYA1, MIA, TMPRSS3, MYO6), two selected splice-site
mutations in three families (identified in KCNQ1 and SLC26A4),
and six insertion-deletion mutations (identified in GJB2, MYO15A
and MYH9), segregation analysis confirmed they are plausible
disease causing mutations (Fig. 2–4). For 163 selected missense
mutations identified in 33 out of 54 known non-syndromic genes,
it is difficult to reach a final conclusion about whether they are
really disease causing mutations or not. Although some of the
families were too small for segregation study or we failed to collect
enough samples from familial members, most cases are consistent
with the assumption that these are pathogenic mutations based on
the software programs to predict the influence on the protein
structure [20]. Actual causative mutations were successfully
identified from the selected recessive as well as dominant families
in which all the samples of family members were collected
(Examples are shown in Fig. 5, 6). TMPRSS3, MYO15A, GJB2,
SLC26A4 were found to be responsible for deafness in autosomal
recessive or sporadic families, while TECTA, WFS1, MYH9, EYA1,
COL4A5 and COL11A1 were identified as the responsible genes for
deafness in autosomal dominant families.
One interesting result is that a mutation in a novel putative
responsible deafness gene, MIA, which is highly expressed in the
inner ear, was identified in a dominant family (#4171), in the
present study. Although the detailed function in the inner ear is
currently unknown, genes that are highly expressed in the inner
ear, as revealed by cDNA microarray analysis, may have a crucial
functional role there [18].
The other interesting result was the mutations in the genes
previously reported to be syndromic genes such as EYA1. Although
re-contact was not possible in all cases, detailed genotype/
phenotype correlation study will be an open question. One family
was later found to be associated with ear pits (diagnosed as BOR
syndrome) (family #4361 in Fig. 5), but the rest of the contacted
families did not have any associated branchial disclosure.
Interestingly, all families were associated with inner ear anomaly,
and therefore these families have slightly different clinical
phenotype from typical BOR syndrome. As in this case, the
mutation analysis using MPS will potentially expand the pheno￾typic variations.
Based on the sensitivity, nonsense mutations, splice-site muta￾tions, insertion-deletion mutations or selected missense mutations
were found in 57 out of 112 genes (33/56 non-syndromic genes,
12/22 syndromic genes, and 12/36 genes highly expressed in the
cochlea). The mutations previously found in Invader assays or
direct sequencing were also confirmed effectively in our MPS
algorithm. Of 93 previously found GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations,
we confirmed 87 (93.5%) of them (Table S3). Approximately
86.6% (187/216) of the patients had at least one mutation.

Of the 187 patients, in 69 the etiology of the hearing loss was
completely explained (biallelic probably pathogenic mutations in
autosomal recessive or sporadic cases, or one probably pathogenic
mutation in autosomal dominant cases), and in 12 was possibly
explained (two mutations with one probably pathogenic mutation
and an unknown variant in the same gene in autosomal recessive
or sporadic cases, or one unknown mutation in autosomal
dominant cases).
A noteworthy result obtained in this study was that the data
clarified the molecular epidemiology for deafness in our popula￾tion. For two decades, there have been extensive efforts to identify
the etiology of deafness and those studies have determined that
genetic causes are commonly involved in congenital/early-onset

sensorineural hearing loss, but there has been no etiological data
on a genetic basis using a large number of patients. It has been
reported that more than 100 loci and 46 causative genes are
causing deafness [25]. To evaluate which genes have an impact on
deafness epidemiology, the number of mutations/mutation
candidates was counted. Among the identified mutations, the
number of GJB2 mutations was exceptionally higher at 80 alleles,
followed by those in SLC26A4, USH2A, GPR98, MYO15A,
COL4A5, and CDH23 (Fig. 7). Regarding the number of possible
mutations in each gene, GJB2 (54:22), PCDH15 (7:1), SLC26A4
(18:3), TECTA (8:2) were frequent in the early-onset group. In
contrast, TMPRSS3 (3:5) was predominantly found in the late￾detected (based on the age of awareness) group. Such tendency is
in line with reported phenotypes.
Actually, detected mutations were confirmed to be pathogenic
in selected families (Fig. 2–6). Although USH2A and GPR98
(which underly Usher syndrome type 2) mutations were great in
number, this is to be expected based on the extremely large size of
the gene.
An important fact is that the samples we used were collected
randomly from 33 different hospitals distributed throughout
Japan, therefore we believe them to be a representative cohort
of Japanese patients and suitable for epidemiological evaluation.
We have developed an advanced screening strategy focusing on
frequently recurring mutations that are most likely to be
encountered in the clinical setting that identifies approximately
40% of deafness patients [5]. This indicates that 30–40% of
patients have deafness due to recurrent mutations in particular
genes, such as GJB2 or SLC26A4. In fact, 25% (53/216 overall),
and 42% (50/120 for early-onset) of the patients were diagnosed
by those recurrent mutations. GJB2 has been known as the most
prevalent responsible gene for deafness worldwide and 14–16%
(25–26% for congenital cases) of Japanese hearing loss patients
have GJB2 mutations [5,26]. Mutations in SLC26A4, MYO15A,
and CDH23 are also reported to be frequent and important causes
of deafness [5,25]. The number of mutations of GJB2 is actually
the highest among the genes in the mutation database (Fig. 7),
supporting the view that the majority of the responsible gene
mutations are such commonly found ones with the remainder
being various rare genes/mutations. Those genes have not usually
been screened and therefore mutations in them have not been
diagnosed by the conventional approach. From that point of view,
MPS has the potential to identify such rare genes/mutations.
In conclusion, MPS enabled us to discover rare causative genes
for a highly heterogeneous monogenic disease and revealed the
genetic epidemiology of deafness. This epidemiologic data will
shed light on gene evolution and provide the basis for future
genetic screening strategies.

Figure S1 The validity of the binomial distribution filter
used in this study. The horizontal axis indicates depth of
coverage of each SNV detected by MPS analysis and the vertical
axis indicates calculated allele frequency in each 12-patient pool
(calculated by alternative base read number divided by total
(alternative+reference) base read number for each SNV). Muta￾tions of the known three genes, GJB2, KCNQ4, and CDH23 either
by MPS (circle) or Sanger sequencing (dot). Red: CDH23, Blue:
GJB2, Green: KCNQ4. The cut-off line using first filtering
algorithm is indicated by a black line. Most of the SNVs detected
by Sanger sequencing were distributed above the threshold
indicating that mutations selected are effectively identified. GJB2
(Blue) had a deeper depth which means MPS data is more reliable
whereas KCNQ4 (Green) had shallow depth, which is less reliable.
Actually Sanger sequencing (dot) showed reasonable data.
