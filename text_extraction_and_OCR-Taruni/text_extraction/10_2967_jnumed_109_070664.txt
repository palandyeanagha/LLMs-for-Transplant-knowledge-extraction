We report our experience with using integrated molecular and
anatomic hybrid imaging to assess infection in patients who
have a left-ventricular-assist device (LVAD). Methods: Thirteen 99mTc-exametazime-leukocyte planar and SPECT/CT scans
were obtained for 8 consecutive patients who had an implanted
LVAD. SPECT/CT was used to assess suspected device-related
infections (n 5 8) and to evaluate the efficiency of current antibi￾otic therapy (n 5 5). Results: Device-related infection was seen
on 8 of the 13 scans. SPECT/CT was positive for infection in all 8
patients, whereas planar scans were positive in 6 of 8. SPECT/CT
provided relevant information on the extent of infection and its
exact location in all patients. Additional distant infectious foci
were demonstrated in 3 of 13 patients. Conclusion: SPECT/CT
led to an accurate diagnosis of LVAD-related infection, revealing
both anatomic location and extent. This noninvasive approach
could lead to improved therapeutic strategies.

Implantation of a left-ventricular-assist device (LVAD) is
increasingly becoming a therapy of choice in patients with
advanced heart failure (1). However, device-related in￾fection continues to be a morbid problem and remains
a serious limitation to long-term use of the device (2).
Major clinical issues include diagnosing the infection early,
determining the location and extent of the infection, and
assessing treatment efficacy. Anatomic imaging modalities
such as CT and MRI are of limited value because of the
presence of metallic CT artifacts and MRI contraindica￾tions.
Leukocyte planar scintigraphy is indicated for the di￾agnosis of infection in various clinical settings (3,4) and has
a documented high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (89%)
for identifying vascular graft infection (4,5). However, the
poor spatial resolution of planar scintigraphy and the lack
of anatomic landmarks are limiting factors. Integrated
SPECT/CT allows coregistration of functional and ana￾tomic imaging (6) and has been successfully proposed for
the assessment of infectious processes in patients prone to
metallic artifacts, especially in the field of bone and joint
infection (7,8). However, not enough data are available on
patients with soft-tissue infection (9). This study reports our
early experience with radiolabeled leukocyte SPECT/CT in
patients with an LVAD and suspected ongoing infectious
inflammatory processes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between February 2007 and September 2008, 13 imaging
procedures were performed on 8 consecutive men (mean age 6
SD, 56 6 11 y) who had an implanted LVAD. The mean duration
that the device was in use was 666 d (range, 188–868 d). Patients
were referred for leukocyte scintigraphy if device-related infection
was suspected or to assess the outcome of antibiotic therapy. Five
patients underwent 2 imaging procedures. Bacteriologic samples
were taken from all patients (repeated blood cultures and local
sample collection at the cable exit site). All patients were
implanted with a HeartMate II (Thoratec) metallic rotary blood
pump (130 · 45 mm) just below the diaphragm. The inflow
cannula is inserted into the left ventricular apex, and the outflow
polyester graft is inserted into the ascending aorta. A percutaneous
electric cable connects the pump, through the skin of the right
flank, to an external system controller linked to a power source
(2,10).

Leukocyte Labeling and Imaging Protocol
Leukocyte scintigraphy was performed immediately after in￾travenous injection of 714 6 58 MBq of 99mTc-exametazime￾labeled autologous granulocytes, according to a validated protocol
(11). The mean average labeling yield was 90% 6 4%. All trypan
blue tests gave positive results ($99% viable cells).
All images were acquired using a SPECT/CT system (Symbia
T2; Siemens Medical Solutions). Planar scans (128 · 128 matrix)
were obtained over the chest and abdomen at hours 1, 4 and 24.
SPECT/CT was performed over the same areas at hours 4 and 24.
The CT current was adapted for the patient’s weight (110 kV and
40–60 mAs), with dose reduction (CareDose; Siemens Medical
Solutions). SPECT data were acquired over 360 (matrix size, 128 ·
128; 128 projections; 30 s/projection at hour 4 and 60
s/projection at hour 24), and images were corrected for attenua￾tion, scatter, and collimator depth dependence. Transverse, sagit￾tal, and coronal slices of corrected and uncorrected SPECT data
were merged with CT and interpreted on a dedicated workstation
(Leonardo; Siemens Medical Solutions). The mean effective dose
for an entire imaging procedure was 14 mSv.
Interpretation Criteria
Foci of abnormal uptake by leukocytes were analyzed on planar
and SPECT/CT acquisitions by 2 experienced nuclear medicine
physicians who worked in consensus and had no knowledge of the
clinical context (i.e., diagnosis of suspected infection or antibiotic
therapy assessment). Findings were considered positive when foci
of labeled leukocyte uptake were greater than background activity
and increased over time. Foci of nonphysiologic abnormal uptake
that decreased at hour 24 were considered inflammatory.
RESULTS
Scintigraphy was performed 337 6 241 d (range, 52–701
d) after device implantation. The final diagnosis was based
on bacteriologic cultures (needle or surgical samples) or
patient follow-up. The patient management strategy is
summarized in Figure 1.
Three imaging procedures were performed early (mean
delay, 54 d) after LVAD implantation (patient 4, scan 1;
patient 5, scan 1; and patient 7, scan 1) because of
postoperative infection; the other procedures were performed
422 6 145 d after LVAD implantation. Clinical, scinti￾graphic, and bacteriologic findings are detailed in Table 1.
Artifacts generated by the prosthetic material were observed
in all SPECT/CT investigations, but the quality of the
examination was considered suitable for analysis in all cases.
Planar Scans
Foci of abnormal uptake considered positive for device￾related infection were detected in 6 of 13 scans (46%). In
these patients, planar analysis did not reveal any additional
foci indicating distant infection and could not distinguish
between deep infection and subcutaneous tissue infection
at the cable exit site (Fig. 2A).
SPECT/CT Scans
Foci of abnormal uptake considered positive for device￾related infection were detected in 8 of 13 scans (62%),
which included the 6 cases of infection detected on planar
scans and 2 additional foci that were due to physiologic
uptake (bone marrow and digestive excretion). In all cases,
SPECT/CT provided additional information on the extent
and location of infection (Figs. 2B22D). In 5 cases (patient
3, scan 1; patient 4, scan 1; patient 6, scan 1; patient 7, scan
2; and patient 8, scan 1), SPECT/CT demonstrated a super￾ficial infection limited to the percutaneous site (Supple￾mental Fig. 1; supplemental materials are available online
only at http://jnm.snmjournals.org). In the 3 other cases
(patient 1, scan 1; patient 1, scan 2; and patient 5, scan 1),
SPECT/CT demonstrated deep infectious foci (Fig. 2).
In 1 of the 8 patients who had a device-related infection
(patient 5, scan 1), SPECT/CT revealed 2 additional foci
of abnormal distant uptake corresponding to previously
FIGURE 1. Strategy for diagnosis and
patient management.

unsuspected left basal pneumonitis and to an epigastric
abscess near the device. The pneumonitis was near the
splenic physiologic uptake, and the epigastric abscess was
behind the sternum; both were therefore missed on the
planar scan. These abnormal foci were confirmed by
bacteriologic cultures and the patient’s clinical course.
In 5 of 13 scans (38%), no device-related infection was
observed. Both planar scans and SPECT/CT scans showed
normal findings in 1 patient (patient 4, scan 2), who remained
free from infection for several months. Distant cervical
infectious foci were revealed in 2 patients by additional
planar scans (no cervical SPECT/CT was performed): tonsil￾litis (patient 3, scan 2) associated with inflammatory uptake at
the cable exit site on planar and SPECT/CT acquisitions
(Supplemental Fig. 2), and an abscessed tooth (patient 5, scan
2) without any other scintigraphic abnormality (Supplemental

Fig. 3). Because of the scintigraphic findings, these 2 patients
received only short-term oral antibiotic treatment, and they
were free of relapse for several months.
In the 2 remaining scans, isolated foci of inflammatory
uptake were observed: the first (patient 2, scan 1) was
a moderate focus at the cable exit site, close to physiologic
digestive excretion, and detected only on SPECT/CT. This
patient was weaned off the device after 692 d because the
patient’s heart recovered. All bacteriologic samples har￾vested during surgery were sterile. The second scan (patient
7, scan 1) presented foci of abnormal uptake on the
shoulders, related to subcutaneous injection of antibiotics,
and the patient was free of any clinical infection for more
than 1 y. In these 5 of 13 scans, the scintigraphic results
were considered true-negative on the basis of the patient’s
evolution (patient 3, scan 2; patient 4, scan 2; patient 5,
scan 2; and patient 7, scan 1) or bacteriologic analysis
(patient 2, scan 1).
DISCUSSION
In patients who have an LVAD, infection and sepsis have
a high prevalence (23258%) and mortality rate (15244%)
and remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality (2,12).
The diagnosis and treatment of LVAD-related infection
remain challenging and controversial (13,14). Microbio￾logic data obtained from the cable exit site or blood
samples can confirm the existence of infection but fail to
determine its precise location or extent. Morphologic
imaging alone is unreliable because of the presence of
metallic artifacts. Leukocyte scintigraphy, although repre￾senting the gold standard for specific detection of deep
abscesses (15,16), lacks the anatomic landmarks that would
allow for exact localization of the infection. Analysis of
planar acquisitions of LVAD patients is especially difficult
because of the device–anatomy relationship (splenic, uri￾nary, and digestive hot spots) and cold artifacts generated
by the metallic device. The use of SPECT/CT allows
precise localization of infection and accurate interpretation
of images (9). Although SPECT/CT registration mismatch
may occur in areas of movement, such as the chest and
upper abdomen (17), all our SPECT/CT scans provided
excellent anatomic localization of the infectious foci.
When sepsis occurs in patients who have an LVAD,
a device-related deep infection is always suspected. In the
context of recurrent device-related infections, leukocyte
scintigraphy with SPECT/CT can be repeated safely, de￾livering a mean effective dose equivalent to that of a di￾agnostic thoracic CT scan (18). Furthermore, scintigraphy
allows whole-body imaging with simultaneous examination
of the LVAD, enabling the detection of unsuspected sites
of distant infection. In our series, leukocyte scintigraphy
revealed unsuspected infectious foci in 3 examinations
(23%), leading to treatment modifications.
Three imaging procedures (patient 4, scan 1; patient 5,
scan 1; and patient 7, scan 1) were performed early after the
LVAD implantation surgery (mean, 54 d). Although scin￾tigraphic assessment of postoperative patients is challeng￾ing because of postoperative inflammatory reactions (19),
we did not observe any false-positive results. Antibiotic
strategies could be tailored to each individual patient,
ranging from a short course of treatment for localized
subcutaneous infections to long-term suppressive treatment
for deep and persistent life-threatening infections. Inter￾rupting antibiotics when the prosthetic material has not
been removed leads, most commonly, to infection relapse.
However, our series underlines the possibility of interrupt￾ing antibiotic therapy without the recurrence of infection
when scintigraphic findings are normal. This possibility
should be confirmed in a larger number of patients with
a longer duration of follow-up.
In an era of heart-graft shortages, the high incidence of
device-related infection is clearly a limitation to the
implantation of an LVAD. Improved monitoring of in￾fection by SPECT/CT, associated with advances in anti￾biofilm drugs, might increase the use of LVADs as the
destination therapy rather than as a bridge to transplantation.
CONCLUSION
These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility and
highlight the potential usefulness of radiolabeled-leukocyte

SPECT/CT in the management of infection in LVAD
patients. Leukocyte SPECT/CT is able to determine the
precise anatomic location and extent of a suspected in￾fection. This noninvasive approach could improve the
management of patients who have an LVAD in place long￾term and should be considered when infection is suspected.
