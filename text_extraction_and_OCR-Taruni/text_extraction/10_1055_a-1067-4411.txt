ABSTRACT
Background and study aims Endoscopic ultrasound-di￾rected transgastric ERCP (EDGE) is a new endoscopic proce￾dure to perform ERCP in Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB)
patients. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic
review and meta-analysis to evaluate technical success,
clinical success and adverse effects of EDGE and compare
it to laparoscopic ERCP (LA-ERCP) and balloon ERCP (BE￾ERCP).
Patients and methods We conducted a comprehensive
search of several databases and conference proceedings
including PubMed, EMBASE, Google-Scholar, LILACS,
SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases to identify studies
reporting on EDGE, LA-ERCP, and BE-ERCP. The primary out￾come was to evaluate technical and clinical success of all
three procedures and the secondary analysis focused on
calculating the pooled rate of all adverse events (AEs),
along with the commonly reported AE subtypes.
Results Twenty-four studies on 1268 patients were includ￾ed in our analysis with the majority of the population being
males with mean age 53.72 years. Pooled rates of technical
and clinical success with EDGE wer 95.5 % and 95.9 %, with
LA-ERCP were 95.3 % and 92.9 % and were BE-ERCP were
71.4 % and 58.7 %, respectively. Pooled rates of all AEs with
EDGE were 21.9 %, with LA-ERCP 17.4 % and with BE-ERCP
8.4 %. Stent migration was the most common AE with
EDGE with 13.3 % followed by bleeding with 6.6 %.
Conclusion Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the
technical and clinical success of EDGE procedure is better
than BE-ERCP and comparable to that of LA-ERCP in RYGB
patients. EDGE also has a similar safety profile as compared
to LA-ERCP but has higher AE rate as compared to BE-ERCP.

Introduction
Obesity is an epidemic in United States, with 35 % of adults hav￾ing body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2 [1]. Indications for baria￾tric surgery are BMI > 40 or BMI > 30 with comorbid conditions
[2]. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly per￾formed bariatric procedure in the world, consisting of 47 % of
the bariatric surgeries with around 200,000 surgeries per￾formed worldwide every year [3, 4].
Rapid weight loss post-bariatric surgery is a risk factor for
development of gallstones, choledocholithiasis, and pancreati￾tis with up to 32 % to 42 % of patients developing gallstones [5,
6]. Obesity can also lead to increased incidence of pancreato￾biliary cancers [7]. This reflects the sheer number of patients
who would potentially require biliary intervention. Endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with
RYGB is challenging for three reasons: (1) The small bowel
limb to be traversed is very long and standard endoscopes and
duodenoscopes are typically inadequate to reach the ampulla;
(2) acute angles and stenosis at the jejunostomy site decrease
the success of reaching papilla; and (3) tortuosity of the scope
trajectory [8, 9]. Various specialized procedures to perform bili￾ary interventions in Roux-en-Y procedures include balloon en￾teroscopy-assisted ERCP (BE-ERCP) (single and double), spiral
enteroscopy, laparoscopic-assisted ERCP (LA-ERCP) and gas￾trostomy tube-assisted ERCP.
BE-ERCP is commonly employed in this situation, however,
due to inferior technical success it is not ideal for all patients.
The reasons for the lower technical success of BE-ERCP are: (a)
length of limb to be traversed; (b) absence of elevator; (c) for￾ward viewing endoscopic view, making it difficult to cannulate;
and (d) narrow diameter and long length of scopes making it
hard to use the proper accessory instruments [8].
LA-ERCP has high technical success rates (papilla identifica￾tion and cannulation) even though it has higher complication
rates [10]. However, LA-ERCP is associated with longer hospital
stays, higher hospital costs, increased complications, and re￾quirement of multiple teams to do the procedure, all of which
are disincentives to performing biliary access via this route
[11, 12].
Endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP (EDGE)
was first described by Kedia et al in 2014 [13]. EDGE uses a lu￾men-apposing metal stent (LAMS) to create a transluminal
gateway from the gastric pouch or the proximal jejunal efferent
limb to the remnant stomach to perform ERCP using a standard
duodenoscope. In studies of EDGE, it has shown to have a high
technical success rate with low risk of complications and lower
hospitals costs [14–17].
The aim of this study was to evaluate technical success, clin￾ical success, and adverse events (AEs) associated with EDGE and
compare it to LA-ERCP and BE-ERCP.
Patients and methods
Search strategy
We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases
and conference proceedings including PubMed, EMBASE, Goo￾gle-Scholar, LILACS, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases
(earliest inception to February 2019). We followed the Prefer￾red Reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines and Meta-analyses of Observational Stud￾ies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocol, to identify studies re￾porting on EDGE procedure, LA-ERCP, and BE-ERCP [18, 19]. An
experienced medical librarian using inputs from the study au￾thors helped with the literature search.
Keywords used in the literature search included a combina￾tion of ‘EDGE, ‘endoscopic, ‘ERCP’, ‘GATE’, ‘balloon’, ‘entero￾scopy’ and ‘laparoscopic’. The search was restricted to studies
in human subjects and published in English language in peer￾reviewed journals. Two authors (BD, AD) independently re￾viewed the title and abstract of studies identified in primary
search and excluded studies that did not address the research
question, based on pre-specified exclusion and inclusion crite￾ria. Full text of remaining articles was reviewed to determine
whether it contained relevant information. Any discrepancy in
article selection was resolved by consensus, and in discussion
with a co-author.
Bibliographic section of the selected articles, as well as the
systematic and narrative articles on the topic were manually
searched for additional relevant articles.
Study selection
In this meta-analysis, we included studies that evaluated per￾formance of EDGE, LA-ERCP, and BE-ERCP in patients with
RYGB. Studies irrespective of inpatient/outpatient setting, geo￾graphy, abstract/ manuscript status, were included as long as
they provided data needed for the analysis.
The following were our exclusion criteria: (1) Alternative
gastric bypass procedures other than RYGB; (2) studies with
sample size < 10 patients; (3) studies done in pediatric popula￾tion (age < 18 years); and (4) studies not published in the Eng￾lish language.
In cases of multiple publications from the same cohort and/
or overlapping cohorts, data from the most recent and/or most
appropriate comprehensive report were included.
Data abstraction and quality assessment
Data on study-related outcomes in the individual studies were
abstracted onto a standardized form by at least three authors
(BD, AD, HM), and two authors (BD, BPM) did the quality scor￾ing independently.
In the situation of randomized controlled trials and case￾control studies, data collection was done as number of report￾ed events (n) out of total number of patients (N) from each
study. The collected data were treated akin to single-group co￾hort studies, therefore, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for
cohort studies to assess the quality of studies [20]. This quality
score consisted of eight questions, the details of which are
provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Outcomes assessed
Primary outcomes
1. Pooled rate of technical success: EDGE vs LA-ERCP vs BE￾ERCP.
2. Pooled rate of clinical success: EDGE vs LA-ERCP vs BE-ERCP.
Secondary outcomes
1. Pooled rate of AEs: EDGE vs LA-ERCP vs BE-ERCP.
2. Pooled rate of AE subtypes: post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP),
bleeding, perforation, stent migration, and infection.
Assessment methodology and definitions
Collected data were matched between the groups (EDGE, LA￾ERCP, BE-ERCP) before statistical analysis. Although, this model
of comparison is indirect, and the approach is comparable to a
retrospective case-control study with matched groups.
Definition of outcomes
Technical success in EDGE studies was defined as successful
cannulation and deployment placement of LAMS across the fis￾tula and successful cannulation of the desired duct in LA-ERCP
and BE-ERCP studies.
Clinical success was defined as resolution of symptoms, la￾boratory investigations and imaging via desired therapeutic
maneuvers.
AEs and their severity were reported according to the Amer￾ican Society of Gastrointest Endosc (ASGE) Lexicon [21].
Statistical analysis
We used meta-analysis techniques to calculate pooled esti￾mates in each case following the methods suggested by DerSi￾monian and Laird using the random-effects model [22]. When
incidence of an outcome was zero in a study, a continuity cor￾rection of 0.5 was added to the number of incident cases before
statistical analysis [23]. We assessed heterogeneity between
study-specific estimates by using Cochrane Q statistical test
for heterogeneity, 95 % prediction interval (PI), which deals
with the dispersion of the effects, and the I2 statistics [24, 25].
In this, values of < 30 %, 30 % to 60 %, 61 % to 75 %, and > 75 %
were suggestive of low, moderate, substantial, and consider￾able heterogeneity, respectively [26]. Publication bias was as￾certained, qualitatively, by visual inspection of funnel plot and
quantitatively, by the Egger test [27]. When publication bias
was present, further statistics using the fail-Safe N test and Du￾val and Tweedie’s “Trim and Fill” test was used to ascertain the
impact of the bias [28]. Three levels of impact were reported
based on concordance between the reported results and the
actual estimate if there were no bias. The impact was reported
as minimal if both versions were estimated to be same, modest
if effect size changed substantially but the final finding would
still remain the same, and severe if basic final conclusion of
the analysis is threatened by the bias [29].
All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-A￾nalysis (CMA) software, version 3 (BioStat, Englewood, New Jer￾sey, United States).
Results
Search results and population characteristics
From an initial 605 studies, 24 studies reported use of EDGE,
BE-ERCP and LA-ERCP in RYGB patients.
In our search process, we encountered studies by Irani et al
[30], Kedia 2015 et al [31], Tyberg et al [32], Kedia 2019 et al
[33], and Ngamruengphong et al [34] that had overlapping co￾horts. The most comprehensive studies (Chiang et al [15] and
Bukhari et al [35]) were included in the final analysis.
Overall, four studies [15–17, 35] provided data on EDGE, 18
studies [11, 33, 36–51] provided data on LA-ERCP, and five
studies [35, 44, 49, 52, 53] provided information on BE-ERCP
for our analysis.
The schematic diagram of study selection as per PRISMA
guidelines and MOOSE protocol are illustrated in Supplemen￾tary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1, respectively.
Baseline population characteristics were comparable be￾tween the EDGE, LA-ERCP, and BE-ERCP groups. Mean age was
53.72 years with a predominantly male population. Patient de￾mographic characteristics are described in ▶Table 1 and re￾ported AEs are summarized in ▶Table 2.
Characteristics and quality of included studies
Three studies were prospective, and the rest were retrospec￾tive. Seven studies were multicenter and the rest were single￾center. None were population-based. All studies reported ade￾quately on clinical outcomes, and assessment and factors were
comparable between the study groups. Overall, 21 studies were
considered of high quality, three were of medium quality. There
were no low-quality studies. The detailed assessment of study
quality is given in ▶Table 3.
Meta-analysis outcomes
A total of 1268 patients were included in the analysis. One hun￾dred twenty-four patients from four studies underwent EDGE,
939 patients from 18 studies underwent LA-ERCP, and 205 pa￾tients from five studies underwent BE-ERCP.
Primary outcomes
1. Technical success
The calculated pooled rate of technical success (▶Table 4)
with EDGE was 95.5 % (95 % CI 84.2–98.8, 95 % PI 52 to 99.7,
I2 = 0), with LA-ERCP was 95.3 % (95 % CI 91.3–97.5, 95% PI
75.7 to 99, I2 = 46.3), and with BE-ERCP was 71.4 % (95 % CI
51–85.7, 95 % PI 6.3 to 98.9, I2 = 87). Statistical p-value was
significant for EDGE vs BE-ERCP, P = 0.01 and LA-ERCP vs BE￾ERCP, P = 0.001 but was not significant for EDGE vs LA-ERCP,
P = 0.98.
2. Clinical success
The calculated pooled rate of clinical success (▶Table 4)
with EDGE was 95.9 % (95 % CI 81.2–99.2, 95 % PI 37.5 to 99,
I2 = 0), with LA-ERCP was 92.9 % (95 % CI 83.9–97.1, 95% PI
14 to 99, I2 = 84.2), and with BE-ERCP was 58.7 % (95 % CI
27.6–84.1, 95 % PI 7.4 to 96, I2 = 0). Statistical p-value for
the difference was significant for EDGE vs BE-ERCP, P = 0.001

and La-ERCP vs be-ERCP, P = 0.009. but was not significant
for EDGE vs LA-ERCP, P = 0.65.
Secondary outcomes
The pooled rates of all AEs and AE subtypes with EDGE, LA￾ERCP, and BE-ERCP are summarized in ▶Table 2 (Forest plots:
Supplementary Fig. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Pooled rates of PEP
and perforation were comparable between the groups,
whereas the pooled rate of bleeding with BE-ERCP was 1.5 %
(95 % CI 0.4–5, I2 = 0), which was significantly lower when com￾pared to EDGE and LA-ERCP, P = 0.04.

Validation of meta-analysis results
Sensitivity analysis
To assess whether any one study had a dominant effect on the
meta-analysis, we excluded one study at a time and analyzed its
effect on the main summary estimate. On this analysis, no sin￾gle study significantly affected the outcome or the heterogene￾ity. Therefore, including or excluding either one of the studies
by Chiang et al [15] and/or Bukhari et al [35] would give us es￾sentially the same pooled results.
Heterogeneity
We assessed dispersion of the calculated rates using the predic￾tion interval (PI) and I2 percentage values. The PI gives an idea
of the range of the dispersion and I2 tell us what proportion of
the dispersion is true vs chance [54]. The pooled rate of techni￾cal success with LA-ERCP had a narrow PI, whereas EDGE and

Publication bias
Based on visual inspection of the funnel plot (Supplementary
Fig. 10), there seemed to be possible publication bias, but
quantitative measurement that used the Egger regression test,
the statistical 2-tailied P value was not significant for publica￾tion bias (P = 0.15).
Discussion
Our study demonstrated that, in patients with RYGB, EDGE pro￾cedure has comparable technical and clinical success rates to
LA-ERCP and has a statistically superior technical and clinical

success rates when compared to BE-ERCP. To our knowledge,
this is the first meta-analysis comparing the outcomes of
EDGE, LA-ERCP, and BE-ERCP in patients with RYGB.
Based on our analysis, the pooled rate of technical success of
EDGE in RYGB patients was comparable to LA-ERCP (96.5 vs
95%, P = 0.98) but was statistically superior to BE-ERCP (96 % vs
71%, P = 0.01). Similarly, the pooled clinical success rate with
EDGE was comparable to LA-ERCP (96 % vs 93 %, P = 0.65) and
markedly superior to BE-ERCP (96 % vs 59 %, P = 0.001).
The core reason for the technical success of EDGE is the ad￾vent and commercial availability of LAMS which creates a tract
for passage of the endoscope (easily bringing the papilla within
reach).
Clinical success of EDGE in most the studies was also 100 %
[16, 17, 35] except for one study where it was 92 % [15]. The
clinical success of the procedure was directly related to the
technical success of the procedure, indicating the importance
of a successful transluminal access procedure and operator ex￾pertise.
All AEs and subtypes of AEs (PEP, bleeding, perforation) were
comparable between EDGE and LA-ERCP. However, when com￾pared to BE-ERCP, EDGE had higher incidence of AEs. It is, how￾ever, interesting to note that rates of PEP were comparable be￾tween all the three groups. The absolute rate of PEP was the
lowest with EDGE procedure and showed a trend towards sta￾tistical significance when compared to LA-ERCP.
LAMS migration was the most common AE encountered with
a pooled event rate of 13.3 %. The main causes of stent migra￾tion are immaturity of the fistula and the manipulation of the
LAMS via the duodenoscope resulting in LAMS dislodgement.
This risk can potentially be reduced via performing a two-stage
procedure so as to allow the fistula to mature before it is tra￾versed. Study with a higher percentage of two-stage procedure
had a lower rate of stent migration [35]. Also, lubricating the
scope generously showed decreased migration in one study
[33].
Weight gain is an AE that was a concern due to presence of a
persistent fistula following EDGE. Only one study reported
weight gain in our literature search [35]. All the other studies
reported an overall average weight loss [32–35]. The reason
for weight loss is unclear, but it has been hypothesized that ma￾jority of the food flows through the Roux tract and not through
the fistula resulting in weight loss [33].
Failure of the fistula to close is another concerning AE for
EDGE. Various techniques have been described to prevent this
including exchange of LAMS with plastic stents, endoscopic su￾turing and OTSC (over-the scope-clips) or a combination there￾of. Limited data is available on the mechanism of plastic stents
and its role in closure of fistula. It works likely by irritation of
mucosa resulting in granulation tissue formation resulting in
closure of fistula [17]. More data are needed on this aspect to
find out the best way to facilitate closure of the fistula.
The strengths of this review are as follows: systematic litera￾ture search with well-defined inclusion criteria, careful exclu￾sion of redundant studies, inclusion of good quality studies
with detailed meticulous extraction of data, rigorous evaluation
of study quality, and statistics to establish and/or refute the va￾lidity of the results of our meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was
minimal to zero with the pooled outcomes of EDGE. We report
the prediction intervals for the primary outcomes, thereby en￾abling our results to be applicable to the real population. With
1268 patients and 27 studies, this is the largest, most compre￾hensive, and up-to-date meta-analysis evaluating and compar￾ing EDGE, LA-ERCP, and BE-ERCP in RYGB anatomy patients.
There were limitations to this study, most of which are inher￾ent in any meta-analysis. The included studies were not entirely
representative of the general population and community prac￾tice, with most studies being performed in tertiary-care referral
centers. Also, the procedure is a novel procedure and does not
reflect the skill of an average endoscopist. Our analysis had
studies that were retrospective in nature contributing to selec￾tion bias. Our analysis has the element of indirect comparison.
Nevertheless, this study is the best available in literature thus
far with respect to EDGE. More studies are warranted to better
evaluate the clinical performance of EDGE procedure, especially
with respect to its adverse events.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates that the techni￾cal and clinical success of EDGE procedure is better than BE￾ERCP and comparable to that of LA-ERCP in RYGB patients.
EDGE is not as expensive as LA-ERCP, minimally invasive, and
can be performed by one endoscopist in one session if needed,
although it is usually performed in a two-stage manner. EDGE
also has a similar safety profile as compared to LA-ERCP but
has higher adverse event rate as compared to BE-ERCP.
