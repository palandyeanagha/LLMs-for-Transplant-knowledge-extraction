Abstract
Background: Cardiac remodelling after acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) is characterised by molecular and cellular mechanisms
involving both left and right ventricles, and biventricular failure
identifies patients with an extremely unfavourable prognosis.
Aims: To assess whether a link exists between increased myocardial
apoptotic rates (AR) at sites of recent infarction and patterns of
unfavourable cardiac remodelling, such as biventricular
enlargement after left ventricular (LV) infarction.
Methods: Twelve patients with recent AMI involving the LV and
not the right ventricle (RV) and with permanent infarct related
artery occlusion were selected at necropsy. Gross pathological
characteristics, such as LV and RV dilatation, and AR at site of
infarction were assessed. Potential false positive results (DNA
synthesis and RNA splicing) were excluded from the cell count.
Results: RV enlargement, defined as a tricuspidal ring greater than
120 mm, was found in five cases and was associated with LV
dilatation. These patients showed significantly higher AR than the
others. When the subjects were divided into three groups according
to progressive cardiac remodelling (absence of cardiac dilatation,
isolated LV dilatation, and biventricular enlargement), the last


group had significantly higher ARs than the other two groups,
showing that myocardiocyte apoptosis is increased in more
unfavourable forms of cardiac remodelling.
Conclusion: Patients with severely unfavourable cardiac
remodelling, such as biventricular enlargement, have extremely
high myocardiocyte apoptosis at necropsy, even late after LV
myocardial infarction, supporting the role of myocardiocyte loss in
determining post-infarction adverse remodelling.
