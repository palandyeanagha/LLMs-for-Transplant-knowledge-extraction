Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic
Shunt in the Management of Refractory
Ascites
Guadalupe Garcia-Tsao, M.D.1
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this article is to describe the pathophysiological basis for the use of
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in patients with cirrhosis and
refractory ascites, the short- and long-term hemodynamic, biochemical, and hormonal
changes after TIPS, and the results of controlled trials of TIPS in cirrhotic patients with
refractory ascites. TIPS placement is associated with normalization of sinusoidal pressure
and a significant improvement in urinary sodium excretion that correlates with suppression
of plasma renin activity (indicative of an improvement in effective arterial blood volume).
Although effective in preventing the recurrence of ascites, the efficacy of TIPS is offset by
an increase in the incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy, a high incidence of shunt
dysfunction, and a higher cost without an overall survival benefit, which should be
reevaluated in light of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents. TIPS placement is currently
indicated in selected cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites who require more than two to
three large-volume paracenteses per month.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CIRRHOTIC
ASCITES
In cirrhosis, two main mechanisms are responsible for
ascites formation: sinusoidal hypertension and sodium
retention.
Sinusoidal Hypertension
Sinusoidal hypertension results from hepatic venous
outflow block. In cirrhosis, this block is both structural,
secondary to regenerative nodules and fibrosis, and func￾tional, due to increased intrahepatic vascular tone and

hyperresponsiveness to vasoconstrictors that, in cirrhotic
rats with ascites, occurs mostly in the postsinusoidal
area.1 It has been shown that ascites is present only in
patients in whom the hepatic venous pressure gradient
(which reflects sinusoidal pressure) is above 12 mm
Hg.2,3 In fact, two recent studies show that the develop￾ment of ascites is significantly lower in patients in whom
the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreases either
below 12 mm Hg or more than 20% from baseline
values.4,5
Sodium Retention
The most likely explanation for sodium retention is a
decrease in effective arterial blood volume secondary to
splanchnic and peripheral vasodilatation that leads to the
activation of sodium-retaining neurohumoral systems
(renin-angiotensin and aldosterone) and plasma volume
expansion.6 Without replenishment of the intravascular
space, that is, without plasma volume expansion, leakage
of fluid into the peritoneal cavity would be a self-limited
process.
REFRACTORY ASCITES AND RATIONALE
FOR TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC
PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT USE
In the majority of cases, cirrhotic ascites responds to the
use of diuretics, which act by increasing urinary sodium
excretion, thereby producing a negative sodium balance.
Refractory ascites, present in 10 to 20% of cirrhotic
patients with ascites, assumes either diuretic-resistant
ascites (ascites that is not eliminated even with maximal
diuretic therapy) or diuretic-intractable ascites (ascites
that is not eliminated because maximal doses of diuretics
cannot be attained given the development of diuretic￾induced complications such as hepatic encephalopathy,
renal and/or electrolyte abnormalities).7 In the majority
of patients (80%), refractory ascites is of the diuretic￾intractable type. The development of refractory ascites
denotes a more advanced liver disease with further
vasodilatation and activation of neurohumoral systems
and a higher mortality.8 Therefore, these patients should
be considered for liver transplantation.
Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is the most
commonly used method to treat refractory ascites.9 It
is a local therapy that does not modify any of the
mechanisms that lead to ascites formation. Therefore,
recurrence of ascites is practically universal, unless there
is an improvement in liver disease (e.g., resolution of
alcoholic hepatitis). Additionally, LVP has been associ￾ated with the postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction,
an entity defined by an increase in plasma renin activity,
that leads to faster reaccumulation of ascites, a higher
susceptibility to develop renal dysfunction, and a higher
mortality.10,11 The incidence of postparacentesis circu￾latory dysfunction is lowest (but not absent) when LVP
is associated with the concomitant administration of
intravenous albumin infusion and when quantities lower
than 4 to 5 L are extracted.10 Albumin infusion has the
objective of increasing effective arterial volume but its
effect is transient. The need for repeated procedures,
requiring albumin infusion, increases the cost of LVP,
potentially increasing its morbidity, and without a sur￾vival benefit.12,13
There is a need for better therapies for refractory
ascites that should ideally act on the pathophysiological
mechanisms that lead to ascites formation, namely sinus￾oidal hypertension and reduced effective arterial blood
volume.
Surgical portosystemic shunts decrease the devel￾opment of ascites.14 Although an end-to-side portocaval
shunt decreases ascites by decreasing blood flow into the
sinusoids (thereby decreasing sinusoidal pressure) and by
decompressing splanchnic capillaries, it can also lead to
greater ascites formation, particularly in patients with
advanced cirrhosis in whom the hepatic venous outflow
block is such that the portal vein becomes the outflow
tract. Conversely, the side-to-side portocaval shunt (and
the mesocaval shunt), by connecting the side of the
portal vein (or the mesenteric vein) to the low-pressure
inferior vena cava, effectively decompresses not only the
splanchnic capillaries but also the sinusoids.15 When
comparing end-to-side versus side-to-side portocaval
shunts, both experimentally16 and in cirrhotic patients,15
side-to-side portocaval shunting results in less ascites
formation and less ascites reaccumulation. However,
given a high operative morbidity and mortality in this
patient population and a high rate of severe hepatic
encephalopathy,17 the surgical side-to-side portocaval
shunt is practically never used for the treatment of
refractory ascites.
The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS) is a nonsurgical procedure by which an intra￾hepatic artificial communication between the portal and
the hepatic vein is created, effectively acting as a side-to￾side portocaval shunt as it decompresses the hepatic
sinusoids. Therefore TIPS should be as effective as a
surgical side-to-side portocaval shunt in treating ascites
without the morbidity and mortality associated with
major surgery.
In addition to decompressing sinusoids, TIPS has
theoretical advantages in the treatment of refractory
ascites because by connecting the portal vein with a
systemic vein, the blood volume that is sequestered in
the splanchnic circulation is transferred to the systemic
circulation, increasing effective arterial blood volume
and sodium excretion.
By reversing the mechanisms responsible for the
formation of ascites, TIPS should be effective not only in
resolving ascites but also in preventing its recurrence,
thereby constituting a more definitive treatment for

ascites than LVP þ albumin and, by preventing other
complications of portal hypertension and ascites, such as
variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome, and sponta￾neous bacterial peritonitis, it could have a beneficial
effect on survival. On the other hand, TIPS has been
shown to lead to the development of liver failure and/or
hepatic encephalopathy as a result of the diversion of
blood away from the liver and into the systemic circu￾lation, and various randomized trials of TIPS for variceal
hemorrhage have identified hepatic encephalopathy and
shunt dysfunction as long-term complications of TIPS,
with no survival benefit.18
EFFECTS OF TIPS ON HEMODYNAMICS
AND SODIUM-RETAINING MECHANISMS
IN CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS WITH
REFRACTORY ASCITES
Immediately after TIPS, there is an increase in cardiac
output and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance
(already decreased in these patients), without significant
changes in mean arterial pressure.19,20 These changes
persist for 2 weeks21,22 to 1 month after TIPS,19,20 but
are no longer present 3 months or more after TIPS
insertion.19,20,22 The increase in cardiac index is most
probably the result of an increase in venous return
secondary to shunting of blood sequestered in the
splanchnic circulation into the systemic circulation
through the newly created shunt. The decrease in sys￾temic vascular resistance is probably the result of in￾creased flow secondary to the increase in cardiac index
(as shear stress increases, the synthesis of vasodilators
such as nitric oxide increases). The mean portosystemic
pressure gradient (PPG) is significantly reduced com￾pared with baseline up to 14 months after TIPS place￾ment, although this effect appears to decrease
progressively over time probably as a result of its pro￾gressive occlusion.22
Liver synthetic function deteriorates after TIPS,
as evidenced by an increase in Child-Pugh score (CPS)
from the first day to 1 month after TIPS,19,20,22,23
however by 3 months post-TIPS, CPS has been shown
to be similar to baseline,22,24 and most studies show an
improvement in CPS 7 to 14 months after TIPS place￾ment,22,24 probably as a result of resolution/improve￾ment of ascites.
Despite an early deterioration in liver synthetic
function and a worsening in the hyperdynamic circula￾tory state of cirrhosis (decreased systemic vascular resist￾ance, increased cardiac index), urine sodium significantly
increases as soon as 7 days23 and definitely 1 month after
TIPS,20,21,25 persisting for up to 14 months.22,24 The
increase in urinary sodium correlates closely with a
decrease in plasma renin activity.19,20–25 Interestingly,
one study shows that the increase in urinary sodium
excretion occurs only in cirrhotic patients with ascites
(particularly those with refractory ascites) but does not
occur in those without ascites.23 Of note, no significant
differences in glomerular filtration rate, creatinine
clearance, serum creatinine, or serum sodium are
observed after TIPS placement in patients with refrac￾tory ascites.
TIPS FOR REFRACTORY ASCITES
Uncontrolled Trials
Ferral et al first reported in 1993 the efficacy of TIPS in
the treatment of refractory ascites.26 In this study,
complete resolution of ascites was achieved in seven of
14 patients although two patients developed new ence￾phalopathy, four patients developed shunt dysfunction,
and eight patients died. Since then, four retrospective
cohort studies and eight prospective cohort studies of
TIPS in patients with refractory ascites in which patients
have been followed for more than 6 months have been
published.27 Success in TIPS placement in these studies
was essentially 100%. In one of the studies, technical
failures occurred in 4/50 (8%) patients, three of whom
had markedly shrunken liver positioned high in the
abdomen.
In uncontrolled studies, TIPS has been shown to
eliminate and/or make ascites easier to manage in the
majority of patients (70%); however, diuretics are still
required (at lower doses) in essentially all patients. Shunt
dysfunction (with consequent recurrence of ascites) oc￾curs in a third of the patients and new or worsened
hepatic encephalopathy occurs in over 25% of the pa￾tients. In a median follow-up of around 11 months, the
observed mortality in these studies was quite variable but
averaged around 50%.28
Controlled Trials of TIPS versus LVP
Five prospective randomized trials comparing TIPS
versus LVP have been published in full to date21,29–32
and are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Not unexpectedly, all five trials demonstrate that
TIPS is more effective than LVP in the control of ascites
(Table 2), and except for one,29 all studies demonstrate a
higher incidence of encephalopathy21,31 or of severe
encephalopathy30,32 in patients treated with TIPS. Re￾garding mortality, the most important end point, one
study shows a higher mortality in patients randomized to
TIPS due to a higher mortality in Child C patients21
;
two trials, which include the largest number of patients,
show no differences in mortality between the TIPS and
LVP groups30,31; one trial shows a significant survival
benefit in favor of the TIPS group32; and in the remain￾ing trial, treatment with TIPS was independently pre￾dictive of a better survival; however, differences
in survival probability were not statistically different.29

Of note, in these studies TIPS was technically unsuc￾cessful in 5% of cases.
As can be observed in Table 1, cirrhotic patients
included in these trials are quite homogeneous, with a
median age of 56 years, a CPS around 9.2, and a
comparable decrease in PPG after TIPS insertion. How￾ever, the two trials that showed a survival benefit may
have included patients with less severe liver disease as
indicated by higher urinary sodium excretion levels and
the inclusion of patients with recidivant ascites.29,32 A
higher sodium excretion is an indirect indicator of lesser
activation of sodium-retaining neurohumoral systems
and therefore of less vasodilatation and less advanced
liver disease. Contrary to refractory ascites that is defined
as a weight loss < 200 g/d despite maximal diuretic
therapy, patients with recidivant ascites are those in
whom tense ascites recurs at least three times in the
course of 12 months but these patients still respond to
diuretics and therefore have a less severe liver disease.7
Furthermore, unlike all other trials, in the trial by Rossle
et al,29 LVP was not routinely associated to albumin
administration, a factor that could have potentially
increased mortality in the group randomized to LVP.
The highest mortality was observed in patients
included in the study by Gines et al,30 in whom hypona￾tremia was more frequent and who also had higher
creatinine levels (Table 1). This is not surprising as
hyponatremia and renal dysfunction have both been de￾scribed as being predictors of poor survival in cirrhosis,33,34
and, more recently, a serum sodium < 130 mmol/L and
a serum creatinine > 1.7 mg/dL have been identified as
the only independent predictors of survival in patients
undergoing TIPS for variceal hemorrhage.35
Two recent meta-analysis, one that included four
of the above-mentioned trials with a total of 264
patients36 and a more recent one that included all five
trials with a total of 330 patients,37 come to the same
conclusions. That is, that TIPS is more effective than
LVP in the control of ascites (up to 12 months after
randomization), that mortality does not differ between
these two treatments and that hepatic encephalopathy
occurs significantly more often in TIPS-treated patients.
Aside from these end points, a preventive effect of
TIPS on the development of hepatorenal syndrome was
observed in the trial by Gines et al,30 effect that is likely
related to suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldoster￾one system; however, this beneficial effect was not
confirmed in a meta-analysis.36 Another potential bene￾fit of TIPS is an improvement in quality of life demon￾strated in an uncontrolled study particularly in patients
with a complete response (elimination of ascites).38
However, these results could not be confirmed in the
only randomized controlled study that evaluated quality
of life using the SF-36 questionnaire.31
Furthermore, in the study by Gines et al, costs
were greater in the TIPS group compared with the LVP
group,
30 partly due to an occlusion rate of 37% requiring
shunt revision. It should be noted that all these studies
used uncovered stents. Polytetrafluoroethylene-covered
stents improve TIPS patency and decrease the number of
clinical relapses and reinterventions while actually de￾creasing the risk of encephalopathy.39 A retrospective
study suggests that patients undergoing TIPS with
covered stents (50% for refractory ascites) have higher
2-year survival rates when compared with patients
undergoing TIPS placement with bare stents.40 The
benefits of covered-stents in the setting of refractory
ascites require evaluation in prospective studies.
Although studies report a decrease in diuretic
requirement in patients treated with TIPS, it appears

that all patients continue to require diuretics (Table 3),
probably because TIPS improves but does not normalize
sodium excretion. In fact, the use of diuretics immedi￾ately after the procedure is theoretically advantageous as
it will reduce central pressure and increase flow through
the shunt.
Controlled Trial of TIPS versus
Peritoneovenous Shunt
The peritoneovenous shunt (PVS) leads to expansion of
blood volume, suppression of sodium-retaining neuro￾humoral systems, and increased responsiveness to diu￾retics. In controlled trials comparing PVS versus LVP,
PVS has shown to be better than LVP in the long-term
control of ascites without differences in survival.12,13
However, the frequent occlusion and complication rates
have led to considering that PVS has only a small role in
the treatment of refractory ascites.9 In fact, a recent
randomized trial comparing TIPS versus PVS in 32
patients with refractory ascites shows that although
ascites control was achieved sooner with PVS (73%
versus 46% after 1 month), TIPS provided significantly
longer long-term efficacy (86% versus 40% after 3 years),
without differences in survival.41 There was a high rate
of shunt occlusion in both groups with median shunt
patencies of 4.4 months and 4 months for TIPS and
PVS, respectively; however, the assisted shunt patency
after PVS was lower than after TIPS (13 versus 31
months). Therefore, PVS should be restricted to non￾TIPS candidates.
COMPLICATIONS OF TIPS FOR
REFRACTORY ASCITES
In uncontrolled studies of TIPS placement in patients
with refractory ascites, the procedure-related com￾plication rate is around 9%, distributed as follows:
intraperitoneal hemorrhage (3%), acute renal failure
(3%) most described as being secondary to contrast
media, sepsis (1.5%), and hemolysis (1.2%). A unique
complication that has been described in these patients is
the development of strangulated umbilical hernia fol￾lowing resolution after TIPS.42 In controlled studies, the
procedure-related complications were only specified in
the study by Gines et al30 and consisted of heart failure in
4 (11%) and severe hemolysis in 3 (9%) patients.
The most frequent complication related to TIPS
placement is the development of hepatic encephalop￾athy, especially during the first months. As mentioned
previously, this complication appears to develop less
frequently with the use of covered stents.39 A recent
controlled trial performed in 75 patients evaluated
whether prophylactic therapies for encephalopathy
(lactitol or rifaximin) were useful in preventing post￾TIPS encephalopathy.43 The incidence of encephalop￾athy in this study was 33% and the 1-month cumulative
probability of developing encephalopathy (or severe
encephalopathy) was not significantly different among
the three groups (lactitol, rifaximin, and no treatment).
Results were the same when the 25 patients in
which TIPS was performed for refractory ascites
were analyzed. Therefore, prophylactic therapy for
encephalopathy cannot be recommended in this
setting. Previous hepatic encephalopathy was the
most important independent predictor of post-TIPS
encephalopathy.
Another recently described complication of TIPS
appears to be a higher incidence of hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients treated with bare￾stent TIPS. In a case-control study, the cumulative
probability of developing HCC at 1, 3, and 5 years was
3, 24, and 34% for the TIPS cohort (138 patients) and 1,
6, and 25%, for the non-TIPS cohort, respectively.44
This observation suggests the need for a strict HCC
surveillance program for these patients.

PORTOSYSTEMIC PRESSURE GOALS
AND POST-TIPS MONITORING
As mentioned above, a hepatic venous pressure gradient
of 12 mm Hg has been identified as a threshold PPG
necessary for ascites development. Therefore, achieving a
PPG of less than 12 mm Hg should be the goal of
therapy. In fact, a post-TIPS PPG >16 mm Hg was
found to be a predictor of nonresponse in one study,45
and another study of TIPS for portal hypertension
demonstrates that the portosystemic pressure gradient
increased to 12 mm Hg in all patients who developed
ascites post-TIPS placement.46
On the other hand, two studies have shown that a
low PPG is an independent predictor of the develop￾ment of post-TIPS encephalopathy. In one of them,
performed in 47 patients, the portocaval gradient cutoff
was < 10 mm Hg.47 Interestingly, in a more recent study
from the same group of investigators, performed in
75 patients, a post-TIPS portosystemic gradient of < 5
mm Hg was the cutoff pressure related to the occurrence
of encephalopathy.43 Therefore, although the post-TIPS
PPG goal should be less than 12 mm Hg, it should also
be greater than 5 mm Hg.
As opposed to the performance of TIPS for
variceal hemorrhage, where serial assessments of TIPS
patency and pressure monitoring may be warranted,
when TIPS is performed for refractory ascites, TIPS
functional assessment is not necessary unless there is
recurrence of ascites, a clinically obvious event indicative
of TIPS dysfunction.
PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE
AND MORTALITY
In prospective cohort studies of TIPS for refractory
ascites (Table 3), the most common predictive factor of
an unfavorable response is serum creatinine25,48,49 or
creatinine clearance.50 On the other hand, patients
with a complete response after TIPS have been shown
to have a better survival.48,51 Creatinine, bilirubin, and
CPS have also been identified as predictors of survival in
these studies.
The MELD (model of end-stage liver disease)
model was designed to predict 3-month post-TIPS
survival and uses a continuous function of serum bilir￾ubin levels, international normalized ratio for prothrom￾bin time, and serum creatinine.52 Only 25% of patients
in this study had TIPS placed for management of
refractory ascites. Several recent studies have compared
MELD with the CPS in predicting post-TIPS survival
with divergent results. One study shows that the MELD
score is better than CPS score in predicting 3-month
survival but not in predicting long-term survival,53
although another study finds no differences in short￾term survival and only a marginal advantage of MELD
in long-term survival.54 Another study shows that both
scores are equally predictive of 1-month, 3-month, and
1-year post-TIPS survival,55 with a cutoff for the CPS of
11. In these studies refractory ascites is the reason for
TIPS placement in only a minority of patients, and it has
been shown that patients undergoing TIPS for refractory
ascites have a significantly poorer survival than patients
with variceal bleeding.55,56 In prospective randomized
trials of TIPS for refractory ascites (Table 2), CPS is
identified as a predictor of survival in two studies21,30
and MELD is the strongest predictor of survival in the
most recent study32; however, the CPS is still more
useful in clinical practice.
CANDIDATES FOR TIPS
The evidence-based consensus recommendation put
forward recently is that first-line treatment of refractory
ascites is repeated LVP þ albumin and that TIPS
should be considered when the frequency of paracente￾sis is greater than two to three times per month.9 A
good predictor of post-TIPS survival is the CPS, and a
score higher than 11 should be considered a contra￾indication for TIPS placement. TIPS should also be
avoided in elderly patients and in those with heart
dysfunction.9 Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who are
drinking alcohol may improve with abstinence and
therefore TIPS should be delayed in these patients.
The efficacy of the newly available covered stents needs
to be prospectively evaluated in patients with refractory
ascites.
