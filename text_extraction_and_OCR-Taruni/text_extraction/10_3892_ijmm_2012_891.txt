Abstract. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play an 
important role in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle 
cells (VSMCs) and accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetic 
patients. Autophagy, a life-sustaining process, is stimulated in 
atherosclerotic plaques by oxidized lipids, inflammation and 
metabolic stress conditions. In our studies, we utilized MTT 
assays to show that autophagy is involved in AGE-induced 
proliferation of VSMCs. Furthermore, treatment with AGEs 
(100 µg/ml) could induce autophagy in a time- and dose￾dependent manner in rat aortic VSMCs. These results were 
further substantiated by electron microscopy and immuno￾fluorescence imaging. Treatment with AGEs activated ERK, 
JNK and p38/MAPK, but inhibited Akt. Pretreatment with an 
ERK inhibitor and an Akt activator inhibited AGE-induced 
autophagy, demonstrating that AGEs induce autophagy in 
VSMCs through the ERK and Akt signaling pathways. In 
addition, RNA interference of RAGE decreased autophagy, 
indicating that RAGE is pivotal in the process of AGE-induced 
autophagy. Therefore, AGE-induced autophagy contributes to 
the process of AGE-induced proliferation of VSMCs, which is 
related to atherosclerosis in diabetes.
Introduction
Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) result from the 
Maillard reaction, which is a non-enzymatic, irreversible 
process (1). Some studies suggest that AGEs accelerate 
atherosclerosis in type-2 diabetic patients with coronary heart 
disease (2,3). In diabetic patients, previous studies have shown 
that proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), 
a key factor in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, are 
significantly stimulated by the accumulation of AGEs and 
their interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end 
products (RAGE) (4,5). Activation of RAGE not only acceler￾ates early lesion formation but sustains lesion progression in 
the diabetic apoE-null mouse model (6,7).
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process involving 
degradation of long-lived proteins. It is important for balancing 
sources of energy at critical times (8,9). There are many 
genes involved in the process of autophagy. Among them, the 
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is critical 
to autophagosome formation. When autophagy is induced, 
the cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3-I) becomes membrane￾associated (LC3-II). LC3-II has been used extensively as a 
marker protein for autophagy (10). In advanced atherosclerotic 
plaques, autophagy is notably activated by several pathological 
conditions, such as oxidized lipids, inflammation, oxidative 
stress and metabolic stress conditions (11-13). However, the 
relationship between AGEs and autophagy in atherosclerotic 
plaques is rarely reported. Therefore, we hypothesized 
that autophagy is a pathological mechanism involved in 
AGE-accelerated atherosclerosis, especially in AGE-mediated 
proliferation of VSMCs.
Autophagy involves both the Akt and mitogen activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The ERK pathway, as one 
of MAPK family members, phosphorylates the Gα-interacting 
protein to accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis to induce 
autophagy (14). In response to starvation, inflammation and 
oxidative stress, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway negatively 
regulates autophagy in VSMCs (15).
The relationship between AGEs and autophagy has not 
been fully elucidated. To study the underlying mechanisms 
of AGE-induced autophagy, we examined the activation and 
the function of autophagy in rat A7R5 VSMCs treated with 
AGEs.

anti-LC3B antibody was purchased from Novus (CO, 
USA). Monoclonal rabbit antibodies including anti-Erk, 
anti-phospho-Erk, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-p38 
and anti-phospho-p38, anti-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT, anti￾mTOR and anti-phospho-mTOR were obtained from Cell 
Signaling Technology (MA, USA). Polyclonal rabbit anti￾RAGE antibody was purchased from Millipore (Boston, MA, 
USA). The MTT, BSA, 3-MA, MAPK inhibitors including 
PD98059, SP600125 and SB203580, were obtained from 
Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). HRP-marked anti-GAPDH 
antibody was purchased from Kangchen (Shanghai, China). 
Rat IGF-1 was obtained from R&D (MN, USA). RAGE RNAi 
was designed and purchased from Shanghai GenePharma 
(Shanghai, China).
Cell culture. Rat A7R5 vascular smooth muscle cells 
(BioHermes, China) were cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco's 
modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Sijiqing, China) in a humidified 5% 
CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37˚C.
Preparation of AGEs. AGEs were prepared as previously 
reported (16). Briefly, BSA was incubated with 0.5 M glucose 
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the dark for 16 weeks at 
37˚C. The unincorporated sugars were removed by dialyzing 
against PBS (pH 7.4). Control nonglycated BSA was incu￾bated in the absence of glucose under the same conditions. 
Endotoxin levels were checked using an endotoxin testing kit 
(Chromogenic TAL Endpoint Assay kit, China). The AGE-BSA 
solutions were confirmed to be endotoxin free (<2.5 U/ml of 
endotoxin).
Western blot analysis. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5% 
deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM 
Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, 2 µg/ml leupeptin 
for 30 min. Total protein concentrations were measured by a 
BCA Protein Assay kit (Applygen Technologies Inc., China). 
After the samples were heat-denatured, they were analyzed 
on a 10 or 15% tris-glycine gradient gel, transferred to PVDF 
membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered 
solution (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes 
were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4˚C. After 
being washed three times, membranes were incubated with 
secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature. Antibodies 
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents 
and imaged using an Image Quant LAS-4000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, 
Japan). The band densities were determined using Multi-Gauge 
Software (Fujifilm).
Immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformal￾dehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After washing with 
PBS three times, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton 
X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then incubated in a blocking 
buffer containing 10% goat serum, followed by incubation 
with anti-LC3 antibody (1:200) in PBS containing 10% goat 
serum overnight at 4˚C. After incubating with 0.1% DAPI for 
5 min at room temperature and another washing step with PBS, 
secondary Rhodanmine Red-X labelled antibody (1:100) was 
applied for 60 min. After washing with PBS, coverslips were 
transferred onto glass slides. Images were captured on a wide￾field fluorescent microscopy (Zeiss).
Electron microscopy. Ultrastructural analysis was performed 
to examine autophagy. Rat A7R5 VSMCs were grown in 
6-well plates, treated with 100 µg/ml AGEs for 6 h, fixed 
with a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde and then sent to 
Zhejiang University for electron microscopic analysis.
RNA interference. For function-blocking experiments, we 
used small interfering RNA molecules (siRNA) targeted to 
RAGE mRNA. RAGE siRNA was purchased from Shanghai 
GenePharma. The siRNA was designed against RAGE (sense, 
5'-GCCGGAAAUUGUGAAUCCUTT-3'; antisense, 5'-AGGA 
UUCACAAUUUCCGGCTT-3'). The negative control siRNA 
was non-targeting (sense, 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG 
UTT-3'; antisense, 5'-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3'). 
Cells were transfected with si-RAGE using Lipofectamine 
2000 (Invitrogen, USA) for 48 h according to the manu￾facturer's instructions. The final concentration of siRNA was 
100 pM. The efficacy of RNA interference was determined by 
Western blotting.
Measurement of proliferation of VSMCs. To assess cell 
proliferation, rat A7R5 VSMCs were plated in a 96-well 
plate. After 24 h, the medium was changed, and the cells 
were incubated with fresh medium containing AGEs (100 µg/
ml) or 3-MA (2 mM) for another 48 h. Then, 20 µl of MTT 
solution (final concentration, 5 mg/ml was added to each 
well for 4 h at 37˚C. The medium was then discarded and 
100 µl of DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance was 
measured at 490 nm.
Statistical analysis. All data were obtained from at least 3 
individual experiments. Values are expressed as the mean 
± SEM. Statistical analysis between groups was performed 
by one-way ANOVA. The statistical significance was set at 
p<0.05.
Results
AGE-induced autophagy in rat A7R5 VSMCs. To determine 
whether AGEs can affect the level of autophagy in VSMCs, 
cells were treated with AGEs or BSA (100 µg/ml) for various 
times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h). The expression of LC3-II 
and the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I were significantly increased 
after treatment with AGEs, peaking at 6 h. In contrast, treatment 
with BSA did not change the expression of LC3-II or the LC3-II 
to LC3-I ratio (Fig. 1A). Cells were also treated with AGEs or 
BSA at various concentrations (0, 1, 10 and 100 µg/ml) for 6 h. 
The expression of LC3-II and the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio were 
notably increased in a dose-dependent manner in AGE-treated 
cells (Fig. 1B).
To directly visualize autophagy, we used transmission 
electron microscopy to examine autophagic vacuoles (auto￾phagosomes). We treated cells with 100 µg/ml BSA or AGEs 
for 6 h. In BSA-treated cells, autophagic vacuoles were 
rarely detected. However, we found that autophagic vacuoles 
containing cellular material or membranous structures were 
increased in AGE-treated cells (bold arrows in Fig. 1C).

To examine the localization of autophagosomes in rat A7R5 
VSMCs, we detected the autophagosome-specific protein LC3 
(red fluorescence) by immunofluorescence imaging. Cells were 
treated with 100 µg/ml BSA or AGEs for 6 h. In BSA-treated 
cells, LC3 was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm. 
In contrast, LC3 was found in dots around the nucleus in cells 
treated with AGEs (blue fluorescence) (indicated by white 
arrows in Fig. 1D).
Autophagy is involved in AGE-induced proliferation. Compared 
with the control group, cells treated with 100 µg/ml AGEs for 
48 h showed increased proliferation of VSMCs. Furthermore, 
pretreating cells with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, for 30 min 
could attenuate this effect (Fig. 2). This indicates that autophagy 
is involved in AGE-induced proliferation of VSMCs.
The ERK pathway is involved in AGE-induced autophagy. 
MAPK pathways are important for cells to respond to 
numerous extracellular signals. To investigate the mecha￾nisms involved in AGE-induced autophagy, we examined 
the phosphorylation level of various MAPK family proteins 
(ERK, p38, JNK) in VSMCs by western blotting. Cells were 
treated with 100 µg/ml AGEs for 0, 7.5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min.

and LC3-II protein levels treated with BSA or AGEs. Cells were treated with 100 µg/ml BSA or AGEs for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h. (B) Cells were treated for 
6 h with 0, 1, 10, 100 µg/ml BSA or AGEs. The results show a time- and dose-dependent effect of AGEs treatment on the expression of LC3-II and the LC3-II to 
LC3-I ratio. (C) Representative electron micrographs of VSMCs treated with 100 µg/ml BSA or AGEs for 6 h. Typical autophagic vacuoles containing cellular 
material or membranous structures (bold arrows) were frequently found in cells treated with AGEs but not BSA. (D) The localization of LC3 as detected by 
immunofluorescence. In BSA-treated cells, LC3 was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm, whereas the cells treated with AGEs showed LC3 dots (red 
fluorescence) around the nucleus (blue fluorescence).
Figure 2. Cell proliferation in cultured A7R5 cells was measured by the MTT 
assay. Compared with the controls, VSMCs treated with AGEs (100 µg/ml, 
48 h) showed increased proliferation. This effect could be attenuated by 
pretreating cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. *

616 HU et al: ERK AND Akt SIGNALING PATHWAYS ARE INVOLVED IN AGE-INDUCED AUTOPHAGY
As is shown in Fig. 2, AGEs stimulated phosphorylation of 
MAPKs (ERK, p38, JNK) in rat A7R5 VSMCs in a time￾dependent manner. Phosphorylation peaked at 15-30 min and 
then declined (Fig. 3A). Pretreating cells with the ERK inhibitor 
PD98059 (20 µM) for 30 min blocked 90% of ERK activation. 
The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 µM) and JNK MAPK 
inhibitor SP600125 (20 µM) also blocked the activation of the 
corresponding MAPKs (Fig. 3B).
In our experiments, the ERK inhibitor PD98059, but not 
the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or JNK inhibitor SP600125, 
suppressed the AGE-induced expression of LC3-II (Fig. 3C). 
The results indicate that the ERK signal transduction pathway 
is involved in AGE-induced autophagy.
The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is involved in AGE-induced 
autophagy. The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes 
cell growth and survival in response to mitogenic signals, is a 
major pathway that negatively regulates autophagy. In rat A7R5 
VSMCs, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR decreased 30 min to 
2 h after treatment with 100 µg/ml AGEs (Fig. 4A). To examine 
the role of the Akt/mTOR pathway in AGE-induced autophagy, 
we used insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to activate the Akt 
pathway (17). We found that rat A7R5 VSMCs pretreated with 
IGF-1 (200 ng/ml) for 1 h showed a notable increase in Akt 
phosphorylation (Fig. 4B).
In addition, pretreatment with IGF-1 (200 ng/ml) suppressed 
the AGE-induced LC3-II expression in Rat A7R5 VSMCs 
(Fig. 4C). This result suggests that the Akt/mTOR signaling 
pathway is involved in AGE-induced autophagy in rat A7R5 
VSMCs.
RAGE plays an essential role in AGE-induced autophagy. To 
further demonstrate the importance of RAGE in AGE-induced 
autophagy, cells were treated with siRNA to RAGE, and the 
levels of activated ERK, Akt, and LC3-II were detected by 
western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies. 
Compared to the control (scrambled) siRNA-transfected cells, 
cells transfected with RAGE siRNA exhibited a 90% reduc￾tion in RAGE protein expression (Fig. 5A). In AGE-treated 
cells, activation of ERK and inhibition of AKT was reversed 
by RNA interference of RAGE (Fig. 5B). This result indicates 
that AGEs activate ERKs and suppress Akt via RAGE.
Furthermore, we found that the AGE-induced expres￾sion of LC3-II was significantly reduced in cells transfected 
with RAGE siRNA compared with control transfected cells 
(Fig. 5C). These data illustrate that RAGE plays an essential 
role in AGE-induced autophagy in A7R5 VSMCs.
Discussion
Previous studies have demonstrated that AGE-induced prolifera￾tion of VSMCs is a key factor in the pathogenesis of acceleration 
of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients (4,18). Yoon et al reported 
previously that AGEs increased proliferation of VSMCs via

treated with 100 µg/ml AGEs for the indicated times (7.5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min). AGEs stimulated phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and JNK in a time-dependent

that ERK signaling is involved in AGEs-induced autophagy. The relative levels of LC3-II to GAPDH are indicated below the corresponding bars. *

ERK and p38 dependent pathways (19). Several recent experi￾mental studies suggest the proliferation of VSMCs in diabetic 
models is related to several cytokines and growth factors, 
including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) (20) and basic 
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (21). In this study, we found 
that autophagy is also involved in AGE-induced proliferation 
of VSMCs. The interaction between AGEs and RAGE signifi￾cantly increased autophagy in VSMCs via the ERK and Akt 
pathways. This may contribute to proliferation of VSMCs in 
the pathophysiological process of atherosclerosis in diabetic 
patients.
Several recent studies have attempted to elucidate the patho￾logical mechanisms underlying disorders that involve AGEs. 
AGEs have been shown to induce proliferation and migration 
of VSMCs, increase generation of reactive oxygen species 
(22), decrease nitric oxide bioavailability (23) and up-regulate 
the production of various cytokines or growth factors (24,25), 
such as TNF-α, PDGF and VCAM-1. However, there is no 
direct evidence for a relationship between AGEs and autophagy. 
In our study, we found the expression of the autophagosome 
specific isoform LC3-II protein was enhanced in a time- and 
dose-dependent manner in cells treated with AGEs. In addition, 
we observed autophagic vacuoles in AGE-treated cells by trans￾mission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate that AGEs 
could induce autophagy, suggesting a novel, pathobiological 
function for AGEs in diabetes.
Autophagy has been recognized as a cellular defense 
mechanism that is used to remove protein aggregates and 
damaged organelles (26). The autophagic vacuole, or autopha￾gosome, contains portions of the cytoplasm and organelles 
and is surrounded by multiple membrane layers. In the fibrous 
caps of atherosclerotic plaques, autophagic vacuoles have been 
detected by electron microscopy in VSMCs (27). However, it is 
still not clear whether autophagy is beneficial or detrimental in 
atherosclerotic plaques. In this study, the autophagy inhibitor, 
3-MA, could attenuate the effects of AGE-induced proliferation 
of VSMCs. This result indicates that AGE-induced autophagy is 
involved in AGE-stimulated proliferation of VSMCs. This may 
provide a new therapeutic strategy for preventing atherosclerosis 
in diabetic patients.
RAGE is a major receptor for AGEs. The binding of AGEs 
to RAGE leads to activation of cell signaling pathways, such 
as the MAPK, p21ras, NF-κB, and JAK/Stat pathways (28,29). 
We found that AGEs induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, 
and p38 and inhibited phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, 
autophagy in A7R5 VSMCs treated with AGEs was reduced 
when cells were pretreated with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 but 
not by SB203580 or SP600125. Activation of the Akt pathway 
using IGF-1 inhibited AGE-induced autophagy. These results

618 HU et al: ERK AND Akt SIGNALING PATHWAYS ARE INVOLVED IN AGE-INDUCED AUTOPHAGY
imply that the ERK and Akt pathways have opposing functions 
in AGE-induced autophagy: the ERK pathway positively regu￾lates autophagy whereas the Akt pathway negatively regulates 
autophagy. However, since we could not exclude the possibility 
that other signaling pathways participate in autophagy, further 
investigation is needed. We also found that RNAi of RAGE 
in VSMCs inhibited AGE-induced ERK and LC3-II activity 
and recovered Akt activity. These findings further underscore 
the importance of the interaction between AGEs and RAGE in 
AGE-induced autophagy.
In summary, our studies demonstrate that AGEs could induce 
proliferation of VSMCs through mechanisms involving regula￾tion of autophagy through the ERK and Akt signaling pathways. 
This suggests that regulating the AGEs-RAGE-autophagy 
pathway can attenuate proliferation of VSMCs and therefore may 
reduce the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. 
Further studies are needed to dissect the relationship between 
AGEs and autophagy in animal models and to explore possible 
drug-targeting methods to regulate this pathway.
