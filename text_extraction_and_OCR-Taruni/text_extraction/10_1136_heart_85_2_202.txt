Abstract
OBJECTIVE To determine the outcome of heart transplantation for
end stage amyloid heart disease in patients treated at a single
centre.
DESIGN Records of all patients with amyloid heart disease who
underwent heart transplantation were examined to determine
survival, graft involvement by amyloid, the course of systemic
amyloid disease, and the cause of death.
PATIENTS 10 patients, mean (SD) age 54 (8) years, received
transplants in the 13 year period 1984 to 1997.
RESULTS Two patients, both with AL amyloid (primary systemic
amyloidosis), died perioperatively. Mean follow up in the remaining
eight patients was 49.9 (39.5) months (range 3–116 months).
Amyloid deposits in the grafts became evident histologically in five
patients with AL amyloid at 5, 11, 12, 28, and 30 months after
transplantation, and in one patient with familial amyloid at 60
months. Echocardiography showed no evidence of left ventricular
systolic impairment at the time of recurrence. Seven patients died,
at 3, 11, 26, 32, 49, 85, and 116 months after transplantation; four
of these deaths were related to amyloidosis. Actuarial survival at
one and two years was 60% and at five years, 30%.
CONCLUSIONS Heart transplantation for amyloid heart disease
remains controversial because of the scarcity of hearts for
transplantation, the systemic nature of amyloidosis, and the
potential for amyloid deposition in the graft. Postoperative
mortality was high (20%), reflecting extracardiac amyloid. Heart
transplantation for end stage cardiac amyloidosis is feasible but,
without treatment of the underlying process, it is a palliative
procedure.
