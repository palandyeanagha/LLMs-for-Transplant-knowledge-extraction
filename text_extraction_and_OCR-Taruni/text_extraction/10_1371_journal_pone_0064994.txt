Abstract
The Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) is expressed on leukocytes, on endothelium of large blood vessels and to a lesser
extent on capillaries. Membrane bound EPCR plays an important role in the activation of protein C which has anticoagulant,
anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. After cleavage by a protease EPCR is also found as a soluble protein. Acute
rejection of kidney allografts can be divided in T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and antibody-mediated (ABMR) rejection.
The latter is characterized by strong activation of coagulation. Currently no reliable non-invasive biomarkers are available to
monitor rejection. Renal biopsies were available from 81 renal transplant patients (33 without rejection, 26 TCMR and 22
ABMR), we had access to mRNA material, matched plasma and urine samples for a portion of this cohort. Renal EPCR
expression was assessed by RT-PCR and immunostaining. Plasma and urine sEPCR levels were measured by ELISA. ABMR
patients showed higher levels of EPCR mRNA than TCMR patients. EPCR expression on glomeruli was significantly elevated
in ABMR patients than in TCMR or control patients. In the peritubular capillaries EPCR expression was higher in ABMR
patients than in control patients. EPCR expression was higher in tubules and arteries of rejection patients than in control
patients. Plasma sEPCR levels did not differ. Urine sEPCR levels were more elevated in the ABMR group than in patients with
TCMR or without rejection. ROC analysis demonstrated that urinary sEPCR is appropriate to discriminate between ABMR
patients and TCMR or control patients. We conclude that urinary sEPCR could be a novel non-invasive biomarker of antibody
mediated rejection in renal transplantation.

Introduction
The Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) is a type 1
transmembrane glycoprotein which belongs to the CD1 receptor
family[1]. EPCR is primarily expressed on monocytes[2], neutro￾phils[3], the endothelium of large blood vessels and to a lesser
extent on capillaries[4]. It binds to the Gla domain of Protein C
(PC)[5] resulting in a 20 fold increase of the PC activation rate[6].
Once activated, Active Protein C (APC) can be released in the
circulation or can stay bounded to EPCR. Circulating APC plays
an important role as an anticoagulant by proteolytically degrading
the coagulation factors Va and VIIIa[7], which are important co￾factors in the intrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation
cascade. EPCR bound APC signals through the G protein-coupled
Protease-Activated Receptor 1 (PAR-1)[8] and exerts several anti￾inflammatory and cytoprotective effects such as inhibition of the
release of inflammatory mediators[9,10,11,12], down-regulation of
the expression of adhesion molecules[13], inhibition of neutrophil
and eosinophil migration[3,14], anti-apoptotic activities[13,15]
and the protection of endothelial barrier function[16,17].
The soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR), resulting from the cleavage
of the extracellular domain of the membrane bound EPCR
(mEPCR) by a metalloprotease[18], can decrease the activation of
PC by competing with mEPCR for PC[18]. sEPCR also inhibits
APC anticoagulant activity by blocking the interaction with
negatively charged membranes[19], an interaction that is neces￾sary for effective inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa.
Currently the role of the EPCR/APC complex in renal
transplantation is unknown; however APC has been extensively
studied in inflammation settings and in sepsis. For example, Gupta
et al. showed increased renal injury in rats with acquired PC
deficiency in a polymicrobial sepsis model[20] and Keller et al.
discovered that treatment with APC attenuates inflammation and
preserves renal function during sepsis in rats[21].
There are two types of acute allograft rejection that can occur
either separately or together: T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR)
and acute antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). TCMR is the
most common form of acute allograft rejection, caused by effector
T-cells that infiltrate and proliferate in the graft (-draining lymph
nodes) leading to graft rejection[22]. ABMR is caused by donor￾specific antibodies and is characterised by histological changes
such as leukocyte infiltration in the glomeruli and peritubular
capillaries (PTC), tubular necrosis, congestion of PTC, infiltration

of granulocytes, endothelial cell damage and finally fibrinoid
arterial necrosis[23]. Damaged endothelial cells release injury
molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, von Willebrand factor
and P-selectin, which can induce leukocyte adhesion and
activation of the complement and coagulation cascade[22]. As a
result of activation of the complement cascade during ABMR
currently one of the most reliable surrogate markers for ABMR is
C4d positivity of PTC[23], which requires having access to biopsy
material, involving an invasive procedure for the patient. In the
clinical setting it is important to distinguish between patients with
TCMR and ABMR, because the treatments of these two types of
rejection are different[22].
In the current study we investigate the EPCR expression pattern
in kidney transplants on both mRNA and protein level; and
correlate plasma and urine sEPCR levels upon acute renal
allograft rejection. We describe how urinary sEPCR can
distinguish between ABMR and TCMR.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of
the patients. The three groups differed in some aspects. The
patients in the ABMR group are slightly younger than those in the
control group (p,0.05). As expected, the median serum creatinine
concentration was higher and the estimated glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) was lower in patients undergoing renal allograft
rejection compared to patients without rejection (p,0.001).
More HLA mismatches were present in patients with ABMR
compared with control (p,0.001) and TCMR groups (p,0.05)
(Table 1). In our hospital, it was not standard care to evaluate
donor-specific antibodies at time of rejection. However, panel
reactive antibody (PRA) measurements were performed before
transplantation, at the time of transplantation, at time of biopsy
and after the biopsy. PRA levels did not change significantly over
time within the 3 patient groups (multivariate analysis, figure 1). At
time of biopsy however, the ABMR group showed significantly
higher levels of PRA compared to control patients (p,0.001) and
patients undergoing T-cell-mediated rejection (p,0.05, figure 1
and table 1).
All patients received immunosuppressive treatment consisting of
CD25mAb (induction), corticosteroids, mycophenolate and a
calcineurin inhibitor. Acute cellular rejections were treated with
pulse doses of methylprednisolone 500 mg iv for 6 days. Antibody
mediated rejections were treated with plasmapheresis for 7 days
and rabbitATG (rATG). The starting dose of rATG was 5 mg/kg,
3 to 5 gifts were administered over 14 days. Dosages were titrated
based on the total lymphocyte count after each administration

Table 2 shows the Banff scores of the patients. TCMR patients
had more tubulitis and mononuclear cell interstitial inflammation
than ABMR patients (p,0.05). 86% of the biopsies diagnosed as
ABMR were C4d positive (p,0.001 versus TCMR and control).
EPCR mRNA levels in kidney transplant biopsies
As shown in figure 2, PROCR/HPRT1 (EPCR) mRNA ratios
were significantly higher in patients with ABMR (0.49 [0.29 –
0.64]) compared to those in patients with TCMR (0.26 [0.23 –

EPCR protein expression in kidney transplants
In order to visualize the expression pattern of EPCR in
transplant biopsies, we performed immunostainings. Figure 3
shows representative EPCR staining patterns in kidney transplant
biopsies. Intensity of staining was evaluated in five kidney
substructures: glomeruli, peritubular capillaries, arteries, veins
and tubules on a semi quantitative scale from 0 to 3[24]. In
general, arteries were more intensely stained than other substruc￾tures. Therefore no score of 0 was assigned for arteries. Intensity of
staining was generally weaker in tubules than in other kidney
compartments, no staining intensity corresponding to a score of 3
was assigned for tubules.
EPCR expression was significantly higher in patients with
ABMR compared to patients without rejection or with TCMR in
glomeruli (p,0.001 and p,0.05, respectively, figure 4A). In
capillaries ABMR patients showed higher EPCR expression only
compared to control (p,0.05, figure 4B).
In arteries we observed higher EPCR expression in patients
with ABMR and TCMR compared to patients without rejection
(p,0.05, figure 4C). The same expression pattern was observed in
tubules (p,0.05, figure 4D)

shown for control (in black), antibody-mediated (ABMR, in light grey)
and for T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR, in dark grey) patients. PRA
values within the groups did not differ significantly over time. However,
at time of biopsy (i.e. during the acute rejection episode) PRA values in
the ABMR group were significantly higher than in the TCMR group
(P,0,05) and the control group (P,0,001). Results are shown as mean

EPCR scores of the venous endothelium did not show any
differences between ABMR, TCMR and control (data not shown).
Plasmatic and urinary sEPCR concentration
Plasma and urine levels of sEPCR were determined by ELISA.
The urinary concentration of sEPCR was corrected for dilution.
We confirmed the presence of intact sEPCR protein, and not
degradation products by western blot analysis (data not shown).
Plasma sEPCR levels were not significantly different between
ABMR patients (599 ng/mL [67 - 1355]), control patients
(623 ng/mL [418 – 1102], p.0.05) or patients with TCMR
(508 ng/mL [381 – 945], p.0.05) (Figure 5A). Conversely, the
urine levels of sEPCR were significantly higher in patients with
ABMR (29 ng/mmol creatinine [9 – 137]) than in either patients
with TCMR (12 ng/mmol creatinine [5 – 50], p,0.05) or without
rejection (13 ng/mmol creatinine [3–30], p,0.01, Figure 5B).
The urine creatinine concentration did not differ between the
groups (p = 0.6).
We found no correlation between protein EPCR scores in the
kidney and sEPCR concentration in plasma or urine (data not
shown).
Association of clinical parameters and Banff scores with
EPCR
Recently, Sis et al.[25] proposed that the cumulative Banff score
for glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis (g+ptc) associates with
antibody-mediated inflammation of the microcirculatory circuit,
irrespective of C4d positivity. Indeed, C4d-negative ABMR is an
increasingly recognised entity. We investigated whether little
(g+ptc#3) or severe (g+ptc.3) microcirculatory inflammation
related to higher levels of urine sEPCR or staining intensity of
EPCR in these renal structures. Glomerular EPCR (p = 0.009) and
the composite of glomerular and peritubular capillary EPCR
scores (p = 0.009) significantly associated with severe microcircu￾latory inflammation (g+ptc.3). Higher scores for EPCR on the
peritubular capillaries tended to relate to higher microcirculatory
inflammation as well (p = 0.09). Not for each biopsy sample, a
matching urine sample was available. Therefore we imputed the
missing values with multivariate bootstrap methods. Complete
case analysis showed a trend for higher urine sEPCR levels at the
time of biopsy when severe microcirculatory inflammation was
present (p = 0.06) (figure 6).
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis
In order to evaluate the possible usefulness of urinary sEPCR as
a non-invasive biomarker for ABMR, a ROC calculation was
performed. The area under the ROC curve was used to
summarize the discriminative ability of the test, the closer to 1
the better.
As shown in figure 7, the sEPCR concentration in urine can be
used to discriminate ABMR patients from TCMR patients (area
under the curve of 0.875, p,0.01) and patients without rejection
(area under the curve of 0.8785, p,0.01).
The cut-off value with the highest combined sensitivity and
specificity for discriminating between ABMR patients and control
patients was at 21.6 ng/mmol creatinine (75% sensitivity, 80%
specificity). The optimum sEPCR concentration for discriminating
between ABMR and TCMR patients was 22.1 ng/mmol creat￾inine (75% sensitivity, 82% specificity). The dotted line represents
the line of equal sensitivity and specificity.
Discussion
This study is the first to describe the levels of membrane bound
and soluble EPCR during acute renal allograft rejection in a
transplant patient cohort.
We observed higher EPCR mRNA levels in ABMR patients
compared with TCMR patients. On the protein level, we observed
in glomeruli more EPCR expression in ABMR patients compared
with patients without rejection or with TCMR. In the peritubular
capillaries EPCR expression was higher in ABMR patients than in
control patients. Immunostaining also revealed a higher expression
of EPCR in arteries and tubules from patients with ABMR and
TCMR compared with patients without rejection. Finally we
found increased concentrations of sEPCR in the urine of ABMR
patients compared with patients with TCMR or without rejection.
Although validation is needed, these findings together with the
ROC analysis indicate that urinary sEPCR could be used as a
non-invasive biomarker for antibody mediated kidney rejection.
There are some limitations to our study. Since it is a
retrospective study some patients could not be studied for all the
different tests. Furthermore the ABMR group contains a relatively
small number of patients with urine sample available. The reason
for this is the low incidence of ABMR within the renal transplant
patient population in our institution. Nevertheless even with a
population of 8 samples from the ABMR group and 21 from the
TCMR group the ROC analysis achieves 80% power to detect a
difference of 0.422 between the area under the curve under the
null hypothesis of 0.5000 and an AUC under the alternative
hypothesis of 0.875 using a two-sided z-test at a significance level
of 0.05.
Another limitation of our study may be the lack of data on
donor specific antibodies (DSA). ABMR diagnosis can be complex
in the clinical setting, often requiring DSA. Indeed, C4d-negative
ABMR is an increasingly recognized phenomenon[25]. DSA are
not routinely determined in our institute. Instead, we have
incorporated the less specific PRA data in our study, showing
that ABMR patients have higher percentages of PRA than TCMR

patients at time of biopsy, i.e. at time of the acute rejection
episode.
It is known from the literature that the expression of EPCR is
not only limited on endothelial cells. On the mRNA level EPCR is
transcribed in HUVEC[26], in a human alveolar epithelium cell
line[27], in rat lung[28], pancreatic tissue[29], in gastric epithelial
cells[30] and in immortalized human proximal tubular epithelial
cell line[31]. In this study we show for the first time EPCR mRNA
in kidney allograft tissue. On the protein level EPCR is known to
be expressed on HUVEC[26], endothelium in the heart, the lung,
the kidney, the skin and on other organs[4] but also on epithelial
cells such as a prostatic cancer cell line[32], human alveolar
epithelium[27], rat lung[28], pancreatic tissue[29] and gastric
epithelial cells[30]. In normal renal tissue, EPCR is expressed on
vein and arterial endothelium[4]. Although the expression of
EPCR by tubular epithelial cells has been described in a cell line of
artificially immortalized kidney cells[31], our study is the first to
actually demonstrate EPCR expression by tubular epithelial cells
in human tissue.
The roles of EPCR and protein C have been extensively studied
in sepsis setting. EPCR and APC form a complex with PAR-1 and
initiate biological effects such as anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory,
anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective activities in vitro and in
vivo[3,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. The APC/EPCR/PAR-1
axis inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators[9,10,11,12],
down-regulates the expression of adhesion molecules[13], inhibits
neutrophil and eosinophil migration[3,14] and exerts protective
activities against infection. APC-EPCR-PAR1 interaction has
been shown to play a protective role in several conditions such as
in a sepsis model using E.coli [33] and was shown to have anti￾Figure 4. EPCR levels of expression in kidney transplant biopsies. Semi quantitative scores (on a scale from 0 to 5) of EPCR immunostainings.

apoptotic activities[13,15] and protect endothelial barrier func￾tion[16,17].
Importantly, Song et al. showed an upregulation of EPCR
expression in the kidney of mice injected with LPS[34].
These findings clearly indicate that EPCR is part of a protective
pathway. Considering this we assume that the higher EPCR
expression during acute kidney rejection could be part of a
protective mechanism for the graft. EPCR could exert its
protective activities on several levels.
Firstly, higher EPCR expression could contribute to enhanced
APC formation and therefore more activation of PAR-1 and its
associated protective properties. This could suggest that an actively
regulated protection mechanism involving the EPCR/APC/PAR￾1 signaling cascade is taking place in the setting of acute allograft
rejection.
Secondly, it is known that ABMR is characterized by activation
of the coagulation cascade, resulting in elevated levels of
FVIIa[22] which can bind to EPCR and activates its associated
protective activities[35].
EPCR not only exists as a membrane bound receptor but also as
a soluble protein. sEPCR has a comparable affinity for APC as
mEPCR[19]. sEPCR can compete with mEPCR for APC,
resulting in a decreased activation of PC[18]. sEPCR also inhibits
APC anticoagulant activity by blocking the interaction with
negatively charged membranes[19], a necessary interaction for an
effective inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa.
Currently, very little is known about sEPCR in transplantation.
The only study on sEPCR in transplantation was performed by
Keven et al, who measured plasma sEPCR concentration before
and after kidney transplantation in patients without rejection[36].
Three months after transplantation the serum sEPCR concentra￾tion was significantly lower than before the transplant procedure.
From this, Keven et al. concluded that the elevated pre-transplant
sEPCR levels reflected endothelial damage, due to the hemo￾dialysis regimen before transplantation[36]. Elevated levels of
sEPCR have been described in vasculitis and SLE, which has
fostered the hypothesis that sEPCR may be a biomarker for
endothelial dysfunction[37].
Considering this, it is not surprising to observe higher sEPCR
production during rejection, knowing that allograft rejection is
associated with endothelial damage and dysfunction especially in
antibody mediated rejection[22]. Until now sEPCR concentration
was only measured in plasma, in this study we are the first to show
sEPCR presence in the urine of patients. The origin of the urinary
sEPCR is unclear. The relatively low molecular weight of sEPCR
(about 43 kDA[38]) makes its filtration through the glomeruli
theoretically possible. Therefore sEPCR could be derived either
from filtrated blood or from shed tubular mEPCR. Shedding of
monocytes or neutrophils bound EPCR might also be an
alternative source of urinary sEPCR.
Renal transplantation is the most suitable therapy for end stage
kidney disease. Despite recent progress in anti-rejection therapy,
approximately 23% of transplanted patients undergo an episode of
acute rejection within the first year post-transplant[39]. For all
patients undergoing a rejection episode it is crucial to have the
ability to correctly diagnose the presence of rejection. Therefore
having access to a convenient biomarker could be of interest for
the clinical practice. Currently, sampling of a kidney biopsy and its
histological examination is the gold standard for diagnosing both
TCMR and ABMR, causing discomfort for the patient.
Therefore we propose that urinary sEPCR could be of interest
for diagnosing acute kidney antibody mediated rejection as proven
by the ROC analysis which demonstrates that urinary sEPCR
might be suitable to make the distinction between ABMR patients
and non-rejecting patients (AUC = 0.875, p = 0.002) and impor￾tantly also between ABMR and TCMR patients (AUC = 0.875,
p = 0.003). Although validation will be needed in a larger patient
cohort, we conclude that urinary sEPCR could be a suitable
candidate to diagnose antibody mediated renal rejection in the
clinical setting, in a non-invasive way.

pathological diagnosis. Renal biopsies that fulfilled the minimal
criteria for diagnostic assessment (7 glomeruli and at least 1 artery)
according to the Banff 1997 criteria were available from all
patients[40]. All biopsies were stained for Haematoxylin-Eosin,
Periodic Acid Schiff Diastase and Methenamine Silver (Jones) and
scored following the Banff 2007 guidelines[41].
Patients were divided in 3 groups, according to the biopsy
diagnosis. The TCMR group consisted of 26 patients with
interstitial infiltration, tubulitis or intimal arteritis [40]. Twenty
patients with acute-tubulus-necrosis-like inflammation, capillary
and/or inflammation and/or thrombosis, arteritis and C4d
tubular deposition were assigned to the ABMR group[40]. In
addition, two patients with signs of ABMR-associated microvas￾cular inflammation[25] with negative C4d staining were assigned
to the ABMR group. Finally, the control group consisted of 33
patients without signs of rejection. Kidney material of the control
group came from protocol biopsies and showed no signs of
inflammation or rejection.
Time matched mRNA, derived from frozen transplant biopsies,
was available for 14 patients in the control group, 13 in the TCMR
group and 11 in the ABMR group as well as matched serum
samples for 21 patients in the control group, 22 in the TCMR group
and 9 in the ABMR group. Matched urine samples (taken from
24 hours urine samples) were available for 22 patients in the control
group, 21 in the TCMR group and 8 in the ABMR group.
Circulating donor specific antibodies are not systematically
measured in kidney transplant patients in our institution.

Consequently, according to the Banff criteria[41], we considered a
patient belonging to the ABMR group when showing a diffuse
C4d staining of the peritubular capillaries on frozen section. If
frozen sections were not available, we performed C4d staining on
paraffin sections, patients with more than 50% of positive
peritubular capillaries were considered as positive for ABMR.
Seven patients who showed signs of both TCMR and ABMR
were included in the ABMR group.
All biological material was collected for previous studies[42,43]
for which written informed consent was given by all patients for
their information to be stored in the hospital database and to be
used for research. This research project used left-over biological
material, anonymised and delinked from patient records, and as
such was not subject to any requirement for ethical review or
approval.
RNA Extraction and Processing for Real-Time PCR
mRNA from complete kidney tissue was extracted from frozen
renal biopsies cut into 25 mm thick sections using a Microm
HM500 cryostat (Adamas Instruments BV) and collected in an
Eppendorf tube containing TRIzol (Invitrogen, Breda, The
Netherlands). After 5 minutes incubation at room temperature
RNA was extracted using chloroform. cDNA was synthesised
using a standard procedure.
Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT￾PCR) was performed on a LightcyclerH 480 Real-Time PCR
System using LightcyclerH 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche
Applied Science, Mijdrecht, the Netherlands). Specific primers
were designed (synthesized by Eurogentec, Lie`ge, Belgium) for
human PROCR (EPCR) (forward AC￾CTTGGCCTTTCCTCTGAC, reverse CTCCCATTCA￾CAGCCACTTC). Results were analyzed using LinRegPCR
12.4 software (Heart Failure Research Center, Academic Medical
Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). PROCR gene expression
was normalized against two different housekeeping genes: HPRT1
(hypoxanthine phosphoribosytransferase 1) and ACTBL2 (b￾actin). Comparable results were obtained with the two house￾keeping genes. We decided to present the ratios between Ct values
of PROCR and HPRT1 (forward TTGTTGGATATGCCCTT￾GACT, reverse CCGCTGTCTTTTAGGCTTTG).
Immunostaining
C4d staining was performed on frozen sections if available using
a mouse anti-human C4d antibody (AbD Serotec, Dusseldorf,
Germany, ref. 2222-8004). Alternatively, C4d staining was
performed on paraffin sections using a rabbit anti-human C4d
antibody (Cell Marque, Rocklin, USA, ref. 404A-14), as described
previously[43].
Paraffin sections of kidney biopsies were immunostained for
EPCR. Antigen retrieval with Tris EDTA pH 9 (20 minutes at
121uC) was performed for optimal staining. 4 mm thick sections
were incubated for 60 hours at 4uC with goat anti human EPCR
monoclonal antibody (452 ng/mL, kind gift of Dr. C. Esmon,
Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). Primary antibody
binding was detected with a peroxydase kit (30 minutes incubation
at room temperature, Powervisoin poly HRP-Anti-mouse IgG,
Immunologic, Duiven, Netherlands). Staining was developed with
Ultra DAB (Immunologic, Duiven, Netherlands).
On EPCR stained sections, the intensity of immunostaining was
scored semiquantitatively on a scale from 0–3 (respectively absent,
weak, moderate or strong) following the method of Faust et al.[24].
Intensity of staining was evaluated in five kidney substructures:
glomeruli, peritubular capillaries, arteries, veins and tubules. All
sections were coded and scored by two blinded investigators. For
each section a mean score was calculated from at least three high
power fields. C4d staining was evaluated following the Banff 2007
recommendations[41] by a blinded pathologist.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Twenty mL aliquots of urine and plasma were pre-treated with
10 mL 1N HCl. After 10 minutes of incubation at room
temperature acidified samples were neutralized with 9 mL 1N
NaOH. Prior to the assay samples were diluted with Calibrator
Diluent (RD5–24 provided with the ELISA kit) to reach a total
dilution factor of 15.6 for urine samples and 39 for plasma
samples. Soluble EPCR concentrations in urine and plasma were
measured using Human EPCR Quantikine kit (R&D System,
Abingdon, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
According to the data sheet the mean minimal detectable doses
is 0.064 ng/mL. Optical densities were measured using a
microplate reader set to 450 nm and were corrected with a
wavelength of 570 nm. A standard curve was created using the
trial version of MasterPlexH ReaderFit software (Hitachi Solution
America Ltd.), capable of generating a four parameter logistic
curve fit.
The urinary concentration of sEPCR was corrected for the
urine dilution by dividing the urinary concentration of sEPCR by
the urinary creatinine concentration (urine creatinine concentra￾tion did not differ between the groups, data not shown).
Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
The GFR was estimated with use of the CKD-EPI formula [44].
Statistical Analysis
All data sets were tested for their distribution prior to analyses.
Data are expressed as median and range unless stated otherwise.
