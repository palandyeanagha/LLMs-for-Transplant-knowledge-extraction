Abstract
Introduction and objectives Lung transplantation provides a
significant survival benefit to patients with advanced idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, at this time, the transplant


community is unable to meet the requirements on it services due to
donor organ shortages. This results in an increased length of time
spent on the waiting list and an increased risk of death prior to
transplantation.
Pirfenidone has been reported to reduce the rate of disease
progression in patients with IPF. It may therefore prolong the
length of time that patients are able to spend on the transplant
waiting list. We report the outcomes of three patients with
progressive IPF who were successfully bridged to transplantation
with Pirfenidone.
Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all
patients who had undergone lung transplantation for IPF from
2012–14 at our institution. Three patients who had been prescribed
Pirfenidone prior to transplantation were identified. Each patient
continued Pirfenidone until the day of transplantation. Patient
demographics, lung function and post transplant data were collated.
Results Prior to the commencement of Pirfenidone the mean
decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) was 52.2ml per month.
Following Pirfenidone therapy, the mean decline in FVC was 29.2ml
per month. The mean length of time from commencing Pirfenidone
to transplantation was 419 days (range 190–768 days). The mean
length of time spent on the transplant waiting list was 144 days
(range 35–271 days).
With a mean follow up of 1.45 years, no episodes of acute or
chronic rejection have occurred. Post-transplant survival is 100%.
No adjustment in immunosuppressant induction or post-transplant
therapy was necessitated. In the post-transplant period, Pirfenidone
therapy was not linked to any adverse events.
Conclusion Pirfenidone has been reported to reduce disease
progression in IPF. However, despite this, lung transplantation
remains necessary in the management of this condition. For patients
with IPF, in whom the transplant window is short, Pirfenidone may
allow for valuable added time on the lung transplant waiting list.
