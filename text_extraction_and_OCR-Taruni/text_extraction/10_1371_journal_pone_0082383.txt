Abstract
Background: Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is a systemic biomarker that is significantly elevated in
samples from patients suffering from hepatic cirrhosis. The protein is generally localized to elastic fibers and other
connective tissue fibers in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and variation in systemic MFAP4 (sMFAP4) has the
potential to reflect diverse diseases with increased ECM turnover. Here, we aimed to validate an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of sMFAP4 with an emphasis on the robustness of the assay.
Moreover, we aimed to determine confounders influencing the basal sMFAP4 variability and the genetic contribution
to the basal variation.
Methods: The sandwich ELISA was based on two monoclonal anti-MFAP4 antibodies and was optimized and
calibrated with a standard of recombinant MFAP4. The importance of pre-analytical sample handling was evaluated
regarding sample tube type, time, and temperature conditions. The mean value structure and variance structure was
determined in a twin cohort including 1,417 Danish twins (age 18-67 years) by mixed-effect linear regression
modeling.
Results: The practical working range of the sandwich ELISA was estimated to be 4-75 U/ml. The maximum intra￾and inter-assay variation was estimated to be 8.7% and 6.6%, respectively. Sample handling and processing
appeared to influence MFAP4 measurements only marginally. The average concentration of sMFAP4 in the serum
was 18.9 ± 8.4 (SD) U/ml in the twin cohort (95% CI: 18.5-19.4, median sMFAP4 17.3 U/ml). The mean structure
model was demonstrated to include waist-hip ratio, age, and cigarette smoking status in interactions with gender. A
relatively low heritability of h2
 = 0.24 was found after applying a model including additive genetic factors and shared
and non-shared environmental factors.
Conclusions: The described ELISA provides robust measures of the liver fibrosis marker sMFAP4. The low
heritability and the relatively limited basal variation suggest that increased sMFAP4 reflects disease-induced
processes.

Introduction
Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is a 66-kDa
homodimeric protein including a C-terminal fibrinogen-related
domain and an N-terminal domain that is involved in disulfide￾bridge cross-linking of the monomers into dimers. The gene
encoding human MFAP4 was described more than 15 years
ago and was identified as one of the genes deleted from
chromosome 17 in Smith-Magenis Syndrome [1]. The porcine
protein homologue MAGP-36 is demonstrated to possess an
integrin interaction domain (RGD-motif) in the amino-terminal
region, and immuno-electron microscopy showed that the
protein is localized in the arterial adventitia specifically
surrounding the elastin-associated microfibrils [2]. The bovine
homologue is further shown to bind directly to elastin as well as
type I collagen [3]. Likewise, the rat homologue MAGP-36 is
demonstrated to be present at sites of high elastin content.
MAGP-36 protein expression is highest in the aorta, whereas
the expression of MAGP-36 mRNA is highest in lung and
trachea [4].
The expression profile of human MFAP4 is not fully
characterized. In humans, MFAP4 is reported to be highly
expressed in tissues of high elastin content such as the wall of
elastic arteries and the skin [5,6]. Moreover, MFAP4 is present
as a soluble protein in lung washings and co-localizes with
elastic fibers in the alveolar septae in the human lung [5].
The physiological role of MFAP4 remains largely unknown.
MFAP4 is suggested to play a role in maintaining the integrity
of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in organs of high tensile
strength, such as the aorta [7]. Moreover, MFAP4 is suggested
to participate in inflammatory processes in the lung [5,8].
Based on its localization in a segment of the proximal tubules
in the kidney, a role in mannose transport is also suggested [4].
Recent data support a role for MFAP4 in tissue homeostasis.
MFAP4 is localized in the periphery of elastic fibers in the skin
and is suggested to be an essential component in microfibril
development. UVB irradiation decreases the level of MFAP4,
whereas over-expression of MFAP4 in a skin-xenografted
mouse-model was demonstrated to protect from photodamage
with reduced degradation of extracellular matrix proteins [9].
In general, remodeling of the extracellular matrix is important
in tissue homeostasis, and the normal balance is disturbed in
many pathological situations including fibrosis [10]. A large
range of proteins, including extracellular matrix proteins and
components, are relevant to consider when searching for
biomarkers to detect developing pathology in tissue
homeostasis, potentially leading to fibrosis. The main ECM
substances are collagens and proteoglycans, and derived
components such as hyaluronic acid can be measured in the
peripheral blood. Various matrix metalloproteinases and their
inhibitors have also been investigated as markers of ECM
remodeling in a variety of pathologies [11-13].
Recently, a search for novel biomarkers in HCV-associated
hepatic cirrhosis revealed MFAP4 to be increased in hepatic
fibrosis [14]. MFAP4 was highly abundant in the cirrhotic
septae, and furthermore, systemic MFAP4 (sMFAP4)
significantly increased with progressive fibrosis stage,
indicating that sMFAP4 may be a novel candidate systemic
biomarker. High diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of non￾diseased liver versus cirrhosis was found [14].
Here, the validation of an ELISA measuring human sMFAP4
is described with an emphasis on the robustness of the assay.
This description includes an analysis of pre-analytical sample
handling procedures addressing time from sample withdrawal
to centrifugation, temperature conditions, and the type of
sample tube used. Moreover, we set out to determine the
normal variation and confounding effects as well as to provide
heritability estimates for sMFAP4 to provide a detailed
characterization of this biomarker to facilitate further
investigations of sMFAP4 levels in liver fibrosis as well as other
pathologies with increased ECM turnover.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Written informed consent was obtained from all twins and the
study was conducted according to the Helsinki declaration. The
study was approved by The Regional Scientific Ethical
Committee for Southern Denmark, who briefed other regional
and the national committees because of the nationwide
character: S-VF-19970271. Immunizations in mice were
approved specifically by the Danish Animal Experiments
Inspectorate and the Animal Ethics Council (license no.
2006/561-1255).
Buffers and reagents
The buffers and reagents used included Tris-buffered saline
(TBS): 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN2
, pH
7.4; TBS/Tw: TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4;
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS): 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 8
mM Na2HPO4

bromophenol blue, pH 8.9; and coating buffer: 15 mM Na2CO3,
35 mM NaHCO3
, 0.05% Na-azide, pH 9.6.
Expression and purification of recombinant human
MFAP4
A recombinant protein representing full-length human
MFAP4 was expressed in Flp-InTM T-RExTM CHO cells as
previously described [5]. In brief, selection for stable integration
was achieved by growth in hygromycin B-containing F12
medium (Ham, GlutamaxTM, Invitrogen). Confluent cells were
washed three times in PBS and allowed to grow for 72 h. The
supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 20
min at 4°C before filtration using a 0.45 µm filter. Finally, the
supernatant was dialyzed against PBS and loaded onto a
HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The recombinant protein
contained an N-terminal His6
- and V5-tag, and application of an
imidazole gradient eluted the full-length recombinant
MFAP4v5His protein (recMFAP4v5His). Similarly, recombinant
full-length human MFAP4 without a His6
- and V5-tag
(recMFAP4) was expressed in CHO cells by insertion into the
plasmid pcDNA5 FRT Topo and growth in F12 medium (Ham,
GlutamaxTM, Invitrogen) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The

protein-containing supernatant was used for the calibration
curve in the ELISA described below.
Production and biotinylation of mouse monoclonal
anti-MFAP4 antibodies
MFAP4-deficient C57BL6 mice (unpublished data, Schlosser
A, 2013) were immunized s.c. with 10 µg purified
recMFAP4v5His in 200 µl PBS/Freund’s complete adjuvant for
the first round of immunization. At 2-week intervals, three
subsequent immunizations were similarly performed using
incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Mice with high antibody titers
were selected for splenectomy by ELISA using 96-well
Maxisorb microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated
with recMFAP4v5His (1 µg/ml in coating buffer). B cell
hybridomas were produced by splenocyte fusion with myeloma
cells (ATCC, CRL-2016 and Sp2/mIl-6), and recombinant
V5His-coated microtiter plates were used for negative
selection. Twenty-one antibody clones were obtained, and
monoclonal antibodies were purified using HiTrap Protein G
affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) as previously
described by Schlosser et al. [5].
To obtain F(ab’)2
 antibody fragments, monoclonal antibodies
were dialyzed against 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Next, a
pepsin (Sigma Aldrich) stock solution (1 mg/ml) was added to a
final concentration of 3% (w/w pepsin/antibody) and incubated
at 37°C for 16 hours. The mixture was separated by size
chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad 26/60, GE
Healthcare) in TBS to purify the F(ab’)2
 fragments.
Antibodies were biotinylated by the addition of 166 µl biotin
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma, H1759) (stock of 10 mg/ml
biotin dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) to 1 ml of antibody (1
mg/ml in PBS, pH 8.5) followed by incubation for 4 hours at
room temperature (RT). Excess biotin was removed by dialysis
against PBS, followed by TBS.
Immunoprecipitation
Coupling of monoclonal antibodies HG-HYB 7-5 to cyanogen
bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) was
performed using 10 mg antibody per milliliter of gel as
recommended by the manufacturer. Anti-OVA antibody was
used as the control antibody (SSI, HYB 099-01). The coupled
beads were added to human serum samples diluted 1:10 and
left to incubate for 2 hours at RT with gentle agitation. Then,
the slurry was washed twice in TBS, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM
CaCl2
 before elution using 100 mM glycine HCl, pH 2.7.
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Unreduced protein samples were prepared by dilution in
SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heating at 100°C for 1 min, and
alkylation by the addition of iodoacetamide to a final
concentration of 90 mM. Reduced protein samples were diluted
in sample buffer containing 60 mM dithiotreitol before heating
and alkylation. Protein samples were separated on 4-12%
Criterion XT Bis-Tris Gels (Bio-Rad) with a discontinuous buffer
system. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto
Amersham Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE
Healthcare). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C
with one of the monoclonal anti-MFAP4 antibodies at
concentrations in the range of 1 – 2 µg/ml in TBS/Tw
containing 2.5% (w/v) dry milk. The membranes were
subsequently incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-coupled
rabbit anti-mouse IgAb (1:10,000, P0206, Dako) for 1 hour at
RT. The membranes were washed and developed using ECL
Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare),
and chemiluminescence was detected with Hyperfilm ECL (GE
Healthcare).
Purification of human MFAP4 from serum
Purification of human MFAP4 from serum was performed by
antibody-affinity chromatography using a Fast Performance
Liquid Chromatography (ÄKTA-FPLC) system (GE Healthcare).
Monoclonal antibody HG-HYB 7-5 was coupled to CNBr￾activated SepharoseTM 4B (GE Healthcare) and packed into an
XK16 column (GE Healthcare). The washing and binding buffer
was PBS/0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and the elution buffer was 3 M
MgCl2
, pH 7.4. Human serum was applied without dilution, and
the collected fractions were immediately dialyzed against 10
mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, using a Medicell International
Ltd dialysis membrane. Anion-exchange chromatography using
a ResourceTM Q column (pre-packed, 1 ml, GE Healthcare) was
then performed with elution in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 1 M
NaCl, pH 6.5. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
followed by silver staining.
Gel permeation chromatography
Gel permeation chromatography was performed as
previously described [5]. Briefly, a sample volume of 200 µl
was applied to an analytical Superose 6 10/300 GL column
(GE Healthcare) connected to the ÄKTA-FPLC system using
TBS, 10 mM (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) EDTA, 0.05%
emulphogen as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A
standard protein mixture (BioRad, cat.no.151-1901) containing
thyroglobulin (670 kDa), thyroglobulin monomer (335 kDa), IgG
(158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and
Vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) was applied to the column in a
separate run.
Characterization of monoclonal antibodies and
selection for assay application
Monoclonal antibodies with reactivity against v5His were
excluded from analysis by ELISA chessboard titrations of
recMFAP4v5His versus the monoclonal antibodies in two-fold
dilutions. Subsequently, competitive analysis was performed to
avoid the combination of a pair of antibodies binding to the
same epitope. Microtiter plates were coated with
recMFAP4v5His (1 µg/ml in PBS), and combinations of the
biotinylated antibody (1 µg/ml), and unlabeled antibody (two￾fold dilution from 25 µg/ml) were added in TBS/Tw.
For pairwise optimization, anti-MFAP4 antibodies (1 µg/ml)
were used to coat the microtiter plates before incubation with
the MFAP4 culture supernatant. The biotinylated antibody was
added in chessboard titrations, and the most optimal antibody
pair was chosen based on the best signal to noise ratio.
Further ELISA optimization was achieved by an investigation
of various coating conditions by including different
concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) in the buffers

for the incubation of samples (0.1% and 1% v/v) and by testing
the use of pepsin digested F(ab)2
-anti-MFAP4 antibodies.
Measurement of sMFAP4 concentrations by ELISA
technique
The sMFAP4 ELISA was performed essentially as described
before with minor modifications [14]. Certified 96-well Maxisorb
plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 2 µg/ml
F(ab)2
 anti-human MFAP4 IgG (HG-HYB 7-5) by incubation
overnight at 4°C in PBS. Each step was performed using 100
µl/well and followed by four rounds of washing in TBS/Tw.
TBS/Tw was also used to block for unspecific reactivity by
incubating for at least 15 minutes. Plates were stored for
several weeks at 4°C before use. Samples, quality controls and
standards were diluted in TBS/Tw and allowed to incubate
overnight at 4°C. The following morning, biotinylated anti￾MFAP4 IgG in TBS/Tw (0.9 µg/ml HG-HYB 7-18) was added
and allowed to incubate for one hour at RT on a rocking table.
Streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Zymed,
Invitrogen) was diluted 1:4,000 in TBS/Tw and incubated for
half an hour at RT. Finally, OPD (0.8 mg/ml, Kementec,
Taastrup, Denmark) dissolved in 50 mM citric acid (titrated to
pH 5.0 with 1 M Na2HPO4
, 0.03% H2O2 added prior to use) was
added and allowed to react for 15 minutes in the dark at RT.
Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 µl 1 M
H2SO4
, and the plates were read at OD492 nm with OD600 nm as
reference.
The calibration curve was obtained by serial 2-fold dilutions
of the culture supernatant from CHO cells expressing the full￾length untagged recombinant human MFAP4 (recMFAP4). The
pure culture supernatant remains stable for several months
when kept at 4°C or -20°C, whereas supernatant diluted in
different buffers (TBS/Tw; TBS/Tw, 0.1% albumin; TBS/Tw, 1%
albumin) exhibits declining recMFAP4 content upon storage.
For this reason, a new serial dilution was prepared for each
ELISA run from aliquots of pure culture supernatant, with
dilutions ranging from 1:100 to 1:6,400.
Each run included two quality controls prepared from
recMFAP4 over-expressing cell culture supernatant using large
suspension volumes to minimize dilution error (Q high and Q
low). The controls were adjusted with an aim to obtain an
ELISA signal intensity near the boundary of the dynamic range
of the assay. All samples were analyzed in duplicate: standard
2-fold dilution calibration-curve samples (as described above),
quality control samples, and serum samples.
A 4-parameter logistic method [15] was used to estimate the
sample MFAP4 content (U/ml) from the absorbance
measurement data (OD492). Each ELISA run had to fulfill the
following set of criteria to be accepted: 1) the five least dilute
samples in the calibration curve had a CV% below 5%; 2) the
quality control samples had a CV% below 5%; and 3) the
results from more than 10 runs were used to construct a Levy￾Jennings plot for each quality control sample with controls only
allowed to deviate 2 standard deviations from the mean.
Assay validation
To document parallelism, several serum and EDTA-plasma
samples were analyzed in 2-fold dilutions along with a
calibration curve. Estimates of inter-assay variation were
calculated for each of the internal controls, including 46
measurements for both Q high and Q low. All accepted runs
from a series of consecutive ELISAs were included in the
analysis. The intra-assay variation was determined by the
analysis of 2 blood donor samples, each measured 12 times on
one ELISA plate. The assay range was estimated graphically
from logarithmically transformed titration series of several
serum and EDTA-plasma samples.
Study populations
Samples from blood donors (n = 103, age 19-65, female/
male = 56/47) were obtained from the Department of Clinical
Immunology, Odense University Hospital, according to the
general permission described in the Danish Standards of
Transfusion Medicine (TMS ver.3.2.2012, http://tms-online.dk).
Other samples used in the assay validation procedure were
withdrawn from volunteer individuals working within the
laboratory. Danish twins aged 18 to 67 years were identified
and enrolled through the Danish Twin Registry as formerly
described [16]. Serum MFAP4 measurements from 1,417 twins
were available. Exclusion criteria were cardiovascular disease,
known diabetes, pregnancy or breastfeeding. The zygosity of
the twins was determined using polymorphic DNA-based
microsatellite markers [17].
Robustness of sMFAP4 measurements
A total of 10 blood samples were drawn using 2 different
types of blood sampling tubes (serum and serum-gel) and 5
different post-venipuncture handling methods (combinations of
varying time intervals before centrifugation (30 minutes or 6
hours, 1, 2 or 8 days) and varying time intervals (immediately
or 6 hours) and storage temperatures (4 °C or -20 °C) before
separation) from 6 healthy volunteers working within the
laboratory. Robustness with regard to ten freeze-thawing
rounds was investigated using sera from 5 healthy blood donor
samples.
Twin analysis
To approximate a normal distribution, serum MFAP4
measurements were initially logarithmically transformed.
Inverse normal plots comparing values of the observed
distribution with the corresponding values of the normal
distribution exhibited an approximate linear relationship, and
the first round of analysis in the mixed effects model described
beneath was performed. Using this approach, the significantly
important confounding variables were identified and included in
box-cox analysis. The theta value obtained from this analysis
was used to transform the serum MFAP4 measurements a
second time. Inverse normal plots and Shapiro-Wilks test were
applied to confirm that a normal distribution could be assumed.
The twin analysis included monozygotic (MZ), dizygotic
same-sex (DZ), and dizygotic opposite-sex (OS) twin pairs.
The basic theory behind classical twin analysis is based on the
concept that monozygotic twins have identical genetic
backgrounds, whereas dizygotic twins on average share half of
their genes. Additionally, an assumption about equal
environment for both monozygotic and dizygotic twins applies.
Basal Variation and Heritability of MFAP4
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e82383

By this assumption, a greater phenotypic variance in DZ twins
compared to MZ twins is explained by the greater proportion of
genes shared between the latter. In other words, greater
phenotypic variance within DZ pairs is to be expected if there is
a significant genetic influence on the phenotype studied.
In standard structural equation modeling, the total phenotypic
variation is described as the sum of genetic and environmental
variation contained within the variance components A, D, C
and E [18]. The genetic influences can be split into additive and
non-additive genetic components: the additive genetic
component, A, represents the sum of the effects of individual
alleles that influence the phenotype, whereas the dominance
genetic component, D, represents interactions between alleles
at the same locus. The environmental influences split into two
components as well: the common variation, C, and unique
variation, E. This distinction is based on an assumption of the
twins having similar environments as they live in the same
family (C), but some experiences are unique to the individual
sibling (E). Further assumptions generally accepted are the
absence of gene-environment interactions, no epistasis
(interaction of alleles at different loci), random mating and
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [19].
The biometrical modeling can be performed as a mixed
effects model treating responses for the single twins (family
members) as responses of different units nested within the twin
pair (family) [19]. The model contains the variance components
A, C, D, and E as described above and can be written as an
error components model given by the following equation: yij = µ
+ Aij + Dij + Cij + εij.
The overall mean is µ, and all components are assumed
normally distributed, and assumed mutually independent.
Hence, the total variance is equal to the sum of the variance
components:
var yi j =σ
2A+σ
2D+σ
2
C+σ
2
E.
Of the four terms described, a maximum of three can be
estimated simultaneously. The method for selecting the best
variance structure model followed standard procedures testing
nested models compared to full models guided by non￾significant P-values and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).
The statistical analyses were performed using Stata ver. 11.2
and R ver. 2.15.1 (www.r-project.org).
Results
Production, relative epitope mapping, and species
cross-reactivity of monoclonal anti-MFAP4 antibodies
Recombinant human MFAP4v5His was produced and
purified as previously described. The obtained recombinant
MFAP4v5His served as the antigen source for the mouse
immunizations and, thus, monoclonal antibody production. An
initial panel of 21 antibodies binding to recombinant human
MFAP4 was included for further analysis. Relative epitope
mapping experiments were performed to exclude antibodies
with similar epitope reactivity, resulting in a final panel of three
antibodies (HG-HYB 7-5, 7-14, 7-18) exhibiting no inhibition of
each other (Figure 1A). Two antibodies (HG-HYB 7-14 and
7-18) were found to possess reactivity toward both mouse and
human MFAP4, whereas the last antibody (HG-HYB 7-5) only
exhibited reactivity against human MFAP4 (Figure 1B, lane 1).
ELISA optimization and validation
The use of the F(ab)2
-antibody as the capture antibody was
preferred to avoid unspecific reactivity when analyzing human
serum sample material, and only HG-Hyb 7-5 proved to be
satisfactorily cleaved by pepsin. The choice of the detector
antibody HG-HYB 7-18 was based on the best signal to noise
ratio.
Parallelism in the ELISA detection of recombinant and native
MFAP4 was documented by running serial dilutions of donor
serum samples along with recMFAP4-overexpressing cell
culture supernatants (Figure 2A). The working range of the
ELISA was estimated to be 4-75 U/ml by logarithmical
transformation of serial dilutions of a number of serum samples
(Figure 2B). The final range estimate was chosen to be more
conservative than the observed boundaries suggested.
Measurements of paired serum and EDTA-plasma samples
consistently demonstrated that the EDTA measurements were
lower than the corresponding serum results (Figure 2C).
Nonetheless, parallelism between the serum and EDTA
measurements could be confirmed by serial dilution of several
paired samples (Figure 2D). Measurements of samples from
103 healthy blood donors confirmed that sMFAP4
measurements were lower in EDTA-plasma than in serum; the
mean sMFAP4 (EDTA-plasma) was 7.9 ± 2.4 (SD) U/ml versus
a mean sMFAP4 (serum) of 19.1 ± 5.4 (SD) U/ml. Blandt￾Altman analysis revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.80, with
sMFAP4 measurements in serum being on average 2.5 ± 1.2
(SD) times higher than the level measured in EDTA-plasma.
The ELISA intra- and inter-assay variations are shown in
Table 1. The CV% for the quality controls was 6.6% for Q high
and 8.7% for Q low, representing inter-assay variation. The
maximal intra-assay CV% was 4.0%.
Potential assay interference from biotin and lipids was tested
and found negative (data not shown).
MFAP4 in human serum
Sera from 4 different individuals were demonstrated to
contain MFAP4, as illustrated by Western blotting of sera
diluted 1 to 10 (Figure 1B, lanes 2-6). Moreover, all three
monoclonal antibodies (HG-HYB 7-5, 7-14, 7-18) were used to
immunoprecipitate MFAP4 from human serum samples, and
Western blotting demonstrated that all three antibodies were
able to precipitate the MFAP4 present in human serum (Figure
1B, lanes 7-10). The blots exhibited bands corresponding to
size estimates of 66 kDa using non-reducing conditions. This is
the expected size of MFAP4 as determined previously [5,14].
Gel permeation chromatography was performed to
investigate the in vivo multimerization of human sMFAP4.
Relevant fractions from the chromatographic procedure were
analyzed by ELISA (Figure 3). The profiles from the analysis of
recMFAP4-overexpressing cell culture supernatant, normal
human serum, and reconstituted human serum demonstrated a
predominant multimer size of more than 200 kDa (Figure 3A,
3B, 3C). Finally, analysis of the purified native protein was

performed, demonstrating two chromatographic peaks possibly
corresponding to partly degraded and less multimeric forms of
sMFAP4 (Figure 3D). The results confirm the conformation of
sMFAP4 in serum to be uniform and multimeric as previously
suggested [5] and, moreover, that the antibodies selected for
use in the ELISA setup specifically detected this form of
sMFAP4.
Pre-analytical handling
Serum MFAP4 measurements were stable up to 10 cycles of
freezing and thawing (Figure 4A). The maximal CV% was
found to be 12.6%, and the mean CV% was 11.9%. There was
no obvious trend of decreasing MFAP4 ELISA detection during
the 10 freeze-thaw cycles. Ten samples from five volunteers
were used to investigate differences in pre-analytical handling
(Figure 4B). Sampling serum in standard tubes with or without
gel demonstrated no significant differences in the measured
sMFAP4 level. Likewise, no significant differences in sMFAP4
measurements were found when samples were stored for up to
24 hours at 20 °C before being centrifuged or when samples
were kept at RT or in the refrigerator for 6 hours before
centrifugation. Using all ten results from each individual and
each type of preparation resulted in a maximum CV% of 9.6%
(Figure 4B). Additionally, in one serum sample from a single
high-expressing volunteer, the fall in sMFAP4 content was
below 20% after storage for 8 days at RT (Figure 4C).
Negligible differences in sMFAP4 measurements were likewise
found when analyzing samples kept in the refrigerator (5 °C)
compared to samples frozen (-20 °C) after centrifugation (data
not shown).
Confounding variables and heritability of sMFAP4
The study population of 1,417 twins was divided into 288
pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins, 290 pairs of dizygotic same￾sex (DZ-SS) twins and 129 pairs of dizygotic opposite-sex (DZ￾OS) twins. The basic characteristics of the twin population have
been previously described [20]. This study sample had an
almost equal gender representation with a mean age of 37.8 ±
10.9 (SD) years. The mean sMFAP4 in the study population
was 18.9 ± 8.4 (SD) U/ml (95% CI: 18.50-19.38, median
sMFAP4 17.3 U/ml), which is in accordance with previous
results reporting a mean value of 17 ± 5.2 (SD) U/ml in a small,
healthy control group of 23 individuals [14]. The distribution of
sMFAP4 in the twin population divided by zygosity is shown in
Table 2. Spiking of known concentrations of affinity purified
recombinant MFAP4 into serum samples was used to estimate
that 1U/mL corresponds to 17.6 ng/mL sMFAP4.
The sMFAP4 distribution was right-skewed, and to
approximate a bivariate normal distribution, the data were
initially transformed to the logarithmic scale. However, the

approximation to normality was not optimal, and a box-cox
analysis including initially identified confounding variables was
undertaken. This analysis resulted in a theta-value of -0.2 and
was used in the remaining analysis.
Using mixed-effect linear regression modeling, the mean
value structure was determined to be influenced by age, waist￾hip ratio, and cigarette smoking status in interaction with
gender. All other measurements, such as height, weight, blood
pressure, fasting glucose level, fasting insulin level, and
additional measurements relating to the metabolic syndrome,
did not exhibit any significant effects concerning the serum
MFAP4 level.

smokers, and smokers (Table 3). Male gender decreases the
sMFAP4 level compared to females, and cigarette smoking
decreases the sMFAP4 level in both genders. However, the
effect of cigarette smoking induces a significantly more
pronounced reduction in sMFAP4 levels in women. Thus, the
analysis demonstrates an apparent elimination of the gender
effect due to cigarette smoking. Increasing age is associated
with increasing levels of sMFAP4, whereas an increasing
waist-hip ratio is associated with decreasing sMFAP4 levels.
The effects of the major confounders are illustrated using either
a mean value for age or a mean value for the waist-hip ratio to
express the sMFAP4 level in the three groups (Figure 5).
The variance structure including additive genetic factors (A),
common environmental factors (C), and unique environmental
factors (E) provided the best fit for the systemic level of serum
MFAP4. The serum MFAP4 level is only moderately influenced
by genetic factors, as the genetic heritability (A) is estimated to
be a2
 = h2
 = 24.3% (Table 3). The model including both additive
and non-additive genetic components but leaving out the
common environment component (ADE-model) was excluded
based on a lower AIC. Likewise, the reduced models AE and
CE could be discarded.
Discussion
The present study describes the technical validation of an
ELISA for measuring sMFAP4 in human samples with
monoclonal antibodies. The ELISA was used to analyze gel
permeation chromatography-separated human serum
confirming one multimeric conformation to be the predominant
detected form of sMFAP4 in the serum. This result is consistent
with previous findings suggesting that sMFAP4 predominantly
forms octamers [5]. Pre-analytical handling of samples before
the analysis of sMFAP4 content was not a critical factor with
respect to temperature or time. The normal variation and
heritability were determined, and the confounding variables
were identified to be age, waist-hip ratio, and cigarette smoking
in interaction with gender. The ACE-model exhibited the best fit
and determined the heritability to be 24%. This heritability is

relatively low compared to the heritability of additional serum
proteins previously measured in the same population eg.
surfactant protein D (h2
 = 0.83) [21]. The low heritability in
combination with a relatively limited normal variation supports
the possibility that systemic MFAP4 variation within and
between patients reflects disease development and
progression.
The ELISA is intended to measure sMFAP4 in clinical blood
samples as already done using sera from patients with various
degrees of liver fibrosis [14]. For this reason, the one antibody
successfully digested by pepsin was used as the capture
antibody (HG-HYB 7-5), thereby reducing the risk of problems
regarding non-specific binding from rheumatoid factor. The
detector antibody producing the best signal-to-noise ratio was
HG-HYB 7-18. The inter-assay variation was within reasonable
limits, and the general use of Levy-Jennings plots for the
process control ensured reliability of the sMFAP4
measurements. The in vivo multimerization of human sMFAP4
was investigated by gel permeation chromatography. The
predominant form of sMFAP4 in serum appeared to be one
major oligomeric conformation. The analysis cannot exclude
the presence of larger complexes not detected by the
antibodies in use, nor can the existence of sMFAP4 in complex
with other proteins be excluded. However, no observations
support these possibilities.
The importance of the pre-analytical handling of samples is a
topic often ignored despite its vital importance. In a clinical
setting, the time from sampling to further processing will
inadvertently vary, and the possibility of cooling samples
immediately after withdrawal will likewise differ. Therefore,
several experiments addressing different aspects of pre￾analytical handling were performed. Overall, the findings
demonstrated that sMFAP4 is stable in serum for several days
and that handling within the first 24 hours resulted in a variation
comparable to inter-assay variation. Additionally, the sMFAP4
measurements exhibited no decreasing trend when samples
were subjected to up to ten rounds of freezing and thawing.
Thus, variation in sMFAP4 measurements due to time and
temperature differences when blood samples are handled in
standard hospital settings or general practices can be expected
to be of limited concern.
The mean systemic sMFAP4 level in the studied twin cohort
was found to be 18.9 U/ml (95% CI: 18.5-19.4), and the
distribution was non-normal with a median MFAP4 value of
17.3 U/ml. This value is comparable to the observed mean of
17 U/ml in a small control population previously reported [14].
The small difference in the mean sMFAP4 between the two
study populations underscores the validity of the determined
sMFAP4 estimate of a population mean. Furthermore, the
small blood donor cohort exhibited a mean sMFAP4 level of
19.1 U/ml (95% CI: 18.0-20.1) and a median sMFAP4 of 18.3
U/ml.
The twin analysis demonstrated a lower level of sMFAP4 in
men compared with women and a lower level of sMFAP4 in
smokers compared with non-smokers. Previously, MFAP4 was
suggested to act as a bridging protein between the ECM and
pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) [8]. Former findings
have demonstrated that serum SP-D levels are increased by

cigarette smoking and male gender [21]. The expectations for
sMFAP4 variation were originally similar, as MFAP4 is likewise
highly expressed in the lungs, and MFAP4 may spill over into
the circulation from the bronchoalveolar fluid during, e.g.,
smoking-induced inflammation. However, the level of sMFAP4
expression does not appear to be regulated in the same
manner as systemic SP-D, and this difference indicates that
the variation in these two systemic biomarkers reflects
processes in different tissues or different aspects of tissue
turnover.
The measured variable related to body size that was found to
be significantly associated with the sMFAP4 level was the
waist-hip ratio; neither height nor weight influenced the
measure significantly. The relationship was an inverse
correlation, as the level of sMFAP4 decreases with increasing
waist-hip ratio. A large waist-hip ratio is associated with an

increased risk of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular
disease [22]. However, predisposing factors for
atherosclerosis, such as blood pressure, were not correlated
with sMFAP4 levels in this population-based study, and no
conclusions about such relationships were drawn.
Several studies have reported that cigarette smoking
accelerates the progression of liver fibrosis in patients with
chronic hepatitis C [23], and typical inflammatory biomarkers
such as CRP and fibrinogen are elevated in smokers [24]. In
contrast, our data demonstrated sMFAP4 to be depressed by
current cigarette smoking, indicating that this marker may be
regulated differently than inflammatory markers.
The general aim of liver fibrosis biomarker studies is to
obtain non-invasive measures to reduce the number of liver
biopsies needed, as this is still the accepted gold standard to
evaluate fibrosis. However, in spite of numerous studies
describing both direct and indirect blood biomarkers of liver
fibrosis, none have fulfilled the criteria as an ideal noninvasive
marker [25], which would alleviate the need for invasive
procedures. The most general problem is misclassification
between the fibrosis stages, and to accommodate this

The covariates determined to significantly influence the transformed serum MFAP4
level include age, cigarette smoking, waist-hip ratio, and gender if non-smoking.
The corresponding coefficients are presented; the low values are a consequence
of the transformation (sMFAP4^0.2). Thus, equations to estimate sMFAP4 levels
are as follows:
sMFAP4(smokers) = (0.518-0.000889*age+0.083*waist-hip-ratio+0.0221)^-5,
sMFAP4(non-smoking males) = (0.518-0.000889*age+0.083*waist-hip-ratio
+0.0087)^-5,
sMFAP4(non-smoking females) = (0.518-0.000889*age+0.083*waist-hip-ratio)^-5.

determined by the following formula: Heritability (%) = V(x) * 100 / V(total).

good test characteristics, particularly when combined with
transient elastography [26]. Therefore, a putative role for
sMFAP4 as a useful biomarker for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis
needs further studies in patients who are also being assessed
by transient elastography as well as by other recognized
biomarkers or combinations thereof.
In conclusion, the described ELISA provides robust
measures of the liver fibrosis marker sMFAP4. The heritability
and the normal variation of the serum MFAP4 level are
relatively low, and the ELISA sMFAP4 measures are stable
with regard to pre-analytical variations. The only identified
factor affecting the basal systemic level besides age, gender,
and cigarette smoking status was the waist-hip ratio. The
findings support the biomarker potential of systemic MFAP4,
with elevated levels in the serum reflecting pathological
processes involving ECM remodeling and degradation.
