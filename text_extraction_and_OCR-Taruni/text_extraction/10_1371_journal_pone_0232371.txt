Abstract
Sarcopenia has been associated with lower overall survival in patients with cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing surgical resection, TACE, TARE, or transplan￾tation. This monocentric study evaluated the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in
patients affected by HCC who received bland transarterial embolization (TAE) therapy, by
analyzing its impact on survival and treatment-related complications. All consecutive
patients who underwent the 1st TAE between March 1st 2011 and July 1st 2019 in our Insti￾tution were retrospectively studied. To evaluate sarcopenia, the skeletal muscle index (SMI)
was calculated by normalizing the cross-sectional muscle area at the level of L3 on an
abdominal CT scan prior to embolization (cm2) by patient height (m2). SMI cut-off values for
sarcopenia were considered � 39 cm2/m2 for women and �55 cm2/m2 for men. Data
about age, gender, body mass index (BMI), underlying liver disease, liver function, MELD
score, Child-Pugh score, multifocal disease, performance status, previous interventions,
length of stay (LOS), complications after the procedure, readmission rate within 30 days,
survival time from TAE and total number and type of TAE received following the first proce￾dure were collected. From 2011 to 2019, 142 consecutive patients underwent 305 TAEs.
Observation time ranged from 1.4 to 100.5 months (median 20.1 SD = 22). Sarcopenia at
baseline was present in 121 (85%) patients. Overall 87 (61.2%) patients died during follow￾up with survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year of 71%, 41%, 22%, 16% and 11% respec￾tively. After multivariate analysis sarcopenia (HR = 2.22, p = 0.046), previous ablation/

resection (HR = 0.51, p = 0.005) and multifocal disease (HR = 1.84, p = 0.02) were associ￾ated with reduced survival. Sarcopenia did not influence the safety of TAE in terms of LOS
(2 days vs 1.5 days, p = 0.2), early complications rate (8% vs 5%, p = 0.5) and readmission
rate within 30 days (7% vs 5%, p = 0.74). Sarcopenia, estimated by the L3SMI method, is an
emerging prognostic factor in patients with HCC undergoing bland TAE therapy as it is asso￾ciated with increased mortality, without impairing the safety of the locoregional treatment.
Measures to ameliorate the SMI, such as nutritional support and physical exercise, should
be evaluated in clinical trials for HCC patients receiving liver embolization to determine their
impact on overall survival.
Introduction
Patients affected by Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) are often unfit for curative surgery due
to advanced disease at diagnosis, portal hypertension, reduced liver function, multinodular
disease and concomitant comorbidities [1,2]. As a consequence, according to the Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, they are frequently referred for intra-arterial ther￾apies including transarterial embolization (TAE) for local disease control, before resorting to
systemic treatments when they are no longer responsive to locoregional treatments or when
they progress to BCLC stage C [3,4]. Among the different techniques, bland transarterial
embolization (TAE) has been shown to improve patient survival and tumor response with sim￾ilar efficacy when compared to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial
radioembolization (TARE) [4,5]. Relying only on the ischemic effect of small microparticles,
TAE does not cause the side effects known to TACE and it is less expensive and less invasive
than TARE [6]. Survival rates following TAE are extremely heterogeneous as patients who
undergo TAE vary significantly in terms of liver function, age and concomitant comorbidities.
On top of these differences, HCC burden (number of nodules and vascular invasion) and its
molecular features play a significant role in the survival post-TAE [7]. Sarcopenia, defined as
loss of skeletal muscle mass, has emerged as a negative prognostic factor in patients with HCC
undergoing surgical resection, TACE, Sorafenib therapy and liver transplantation, as well as in
patients with other solid tumors [8–11]. However, data regarding the impact of sarcopenia in
patients receiving TAE monotherapy are lacking.
The objectives of this study were to assess the impact of sarcopenia estimated by skeletal
muscle index (SMI) on overall survival and the incidence of postprocedural complications in
patients with HCC who underwent TAE in a single center (Humanitas Research Hospital
IRCCS).
Materials and methods
Design of the study
This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate if sarcopenia could be a predictor of overall sur￾vival (OS) in a cohort of patients who received TAE for HCC. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Humanitas Research Hospital IRCCS and was conducted in accor￾dance with the ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written
consent was obtained before every treatment from all patients.
Indication to TAE was given by a multidisciplinary team comprising liver surgeons, oncolo￾gists, interventional radiologists, radiotherapists, and hepatologists [12]. All patients

underwent a full disease staging before being referred to TAE and they were followed up with
CT imaging 1 month after TAE. In the event of disease recurrence or partial response to treat￾ment, the cases were re-discussed; otherwise, a 3 months follow-up interval was established.
Patients with a diagnosis of HCC who underwent the first TAE in our Institute between
March 1st, 2011 and July 1st, 2019 and who had an abdominal CT scan performed up to two
months before the procedure were included; those who had only an abdominal MRI were
excluded due to the impossibility of calculating the SMI. The end date of the observation
period was set to January 17th, 2020.
All TAEs were performed without the use of intra-arterial chemotherapeutic drugs. Techni￾cal variations included microparticles TAE (P-TAE), microparticles plus cyanoacrylate glue
TAE (G-TAE) and Lipiodol TAE (L-TAE), as previously reported by our group [6]. All proce￾dures were performed by two senior operators and two junior interventional radiologists with
at least three years’ experience in an angiographic suite (V5000 Philips Medical System,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands), equipped with cone-beam CT (Siemens Artis-Zee, Munich,
Germany).
We collected the following data for each patient: age, gender, BMI, underlying liver disease
(HCV, HBV, HDV, alcohol abuse, NASH), liver function tests (ALT, AST, AFP, PLTs, INR,
albumin, bilirubin), MELD score, Child-Pugh score, number of HCC nodules, performance
status, previous interventions (surgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy -SBRT- or thermal
ablation), LOS, early complications rate, readmission rate within 30 days and survival time
from TAE. We also considered the total number and type of TAE received following the first
procedure.
Assessment of sarcopenia
Sarcopenia was assessed using the L3-SMI method [13,14]. On the latest available abdominal
CT scan performed before the first TAE procedure, we segmented the lean muscle mass at an
axial plane located at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3), in which both transverse pro￾cesses were visible (Fig 1).

highly sarcopenic (SMI = 21,1) who survived only 21 days from the first TAE B. The green area highlights the same muscles in a highly muscular male
patient aged 60 years (SMI = 64,6, survival 45 months and alive at the end of the study).

This included psoas, rectus and transversus abdominis, internal and external oblique, quad￾ratus lumborum, longissimus thoracis, iliocostalis lumborum and spinalis thoracis muscles.
Images were analyzed using dedicated software (Medstation, Exprivia, Italy) to calculate the
total cross-sectional muscular area from pixels in the density range of -29 to +150 Hounsfield
Units (HUs). Manual corrections to subtract areas with HU values -30 were performed in
order to avoid overestimation of muscular tissue or erroneous inclusion of adjacent visceral,
subcutaneous or intramuscular adipose tissue.
Then, we obtained the SMI normalizing the cross-sectional muscle area (cm2) by patient
height (m2) [14], SMI cut-off values for sarcopenia were set at � 39 cm2/m2 for women and
�55 cm2/m2 for men [15].
Statistical analysis
Stata 13 (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA) was used for all calculations. Survival analysis was per￾formed by E. L. who has five years of experience in medical statistics. Multivariate analyses
were conducted using Cox regression. Death was considered the primary outcome and was
ascertained using the regional registry. T-test and Wilcoxon Rank-sum test were used to ana￾lyze differences between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients for specific instances.
Predictors of survival were estimated using univariate analyses and log-rank tests for cate￾gorical variables. We tested the following potential interactions: TAE-related complications
and number of treatments; previous treatments and number of HCC nodules. Kaplan-Meier
curves were also generated (Fig 2).
Results
Descriptive data of the study population
From 2011 to 2019, we included 142 patients (32 F, 110 M). Patient characteristics are shown
in Table 1.
At baseline, the mean age was 73 year old (median = 75, SD = 9.5, range 40–88).
The most common liver diseases were HCV infection in 65 cases (46%) and alcohol abuse
in 33 (23%); 9 patients (6%) had an unknown cause of liver disease. One-hundred-six patients
(75%) had a multifocal disease (mean number of nodules = 2 range 1–3) with the largest
tumor measuring averagely 34mm (SD = 22; median = 28mm, range 7–115).
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 in 57 patients
(40%), 1 in 68 patients (48%), 2 in 16 patients (11%) and in one patient it could not be
assessed.
The MELD score was in average 10 (SD = 3; median = 9, range 6–29); Child-Pugh score
was class A in 93 patients (81.5%), class B in 20 (17.5%) and class C in 1 patient (1%).
BCLC was very early stage (0) in seven patients (5%); early stage (A) in 31 patients (21.4%);
intermediate stage (B) in 81 patients (57%); advanced stage (C) in 21 patients (14.8%); terminal
stage (D) in one patient (0.7%) and in one patient it could not be assessed.
Eighty-six patients (61%) had not undergone previous treatment for HCC while fifty-six
patients (39%) had a history of previous percutaneous ablation or liver resection. Overall, 305
TAEs were performed (average 2.2, SD = 1.4): in detail, 143 G-TAEs (47%), 123 P-TAEs (40%)
and 39 L-TAEs (13%) (Table 2).
The average BMI was 25.8 (SD = 4.9; median 25.5, range 16.7–53); the mean SMI was 41
(SD = 8.9; median 41, range 21.1–64.8).
Sarcopenia, defined as SMI cut-off values � 39 cm2/m2 for women and �55 cm2/m2 for
men, was present in 121 (85%) patients. The prevalence of sarcopenia was not significantly dif￾ferent between patients with single or multiple HCC nodules.

Impact of sarcopenia on the safety of TAE
Mean LOS after TAE was 2 days (SD = 1.7, range 1–15). After the procedure, 11 patients (8%)
had early complications (6 had digestive bleeding, 3 had sepsis and 2 had liver decompensa￾tion) and 9 (6%) had unplanned readmission within 30 days. No statistically significant differ￾ences were found between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients concerning the following:
LOS (2 days vs 1.5 days, p = 0.2), early complications rate (8% vs 5%, p = 0.5) and rate of read￾mission within 30 days (7% vs 5%, p = 0.74).
Impact of sarcopenia on survival
Patients were followed up regularly for a mean of 27 months (1.4–100.5 months: median 20.1;
SD = 22).
Eighty-seven (61.2%) patients died during the follow-up period; with survival rates at 1-, 2-,
3-, 4-, and 5-year being 71%, 41%, 22%, 16% and 11% respectively. (Table 3, Fig 3).
When testing OS prediction, the univariate analysis (Table 4) resulted in the inclusion of
the following variables: being sarcopenic, performance status, multifocal disease, history of
previous surgical or ablative treatments, MELD score and patient weight. After multivariate
analysis (Table 5), the following were predictors of lower OS: sarcopenia (HR = 2.22,
p = 0.046), previous ablation/resection (HR = 0.52, p = 0.005) and multifocal disease
(HR = 1.84, p = 0.02). The potential interactions proved non-significant and were not included
in the final model.
Discussion
The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) defines sarcopenia
as “a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and
strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life and

death” [16]. Sarcopenia has been recently associated with increased mortality in patients with
HCC or cirrhosis, regardless of the treatment received [17]. Particularly, its prognostic value
has been analyzed in patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection, TACE therapy, Sorafe￾nib therapy, or transplantation. In our Institution, however, TAE is preferred over TACE in
patients with unresectable HCC as it provides similar survival rates without the side effects
related to arterial chemotherapy [6,18]. Briefly, the aim of TAE therapy, as opposed to TACE,
is to deploy the embolizing agent from a distal stance, in close proximity to the tumor, to
achieve the maximum ischemic effect and promote necrosis of tumoral cells.
Of note, the advantage of adding chemotherapy to bland embolization is a controversial
topic [18]. In this retrospective survival analysis conducted in consecutive patients who under￾went TAE at our center, we observed that sarcopenia is a negative prognostic factor also for HCC
patients receiving TAE monotherapy, highlighting its role as a potential determinant for patient
stratification and selection of candidates. Other factors affected OS: first, a history of surgical
resection or percutaneous ablation prior to TAE, which may have implied a long-standing disease;
second, the presence of multiple as opposed to a single unresectable nodules (Fig 4), indicator of a
greater disease burden, which may account for a poorer life expectancy [19].
Survival rates in non-sarcopenic patients were slightly lower at 4- and 5-year compared to
sarcopenic patients (14% vs 17%; 10% vs 12%). However, this did not impact the statistical sig￾nificance of our results, hence no correlation with sarcopenia may be assumed.
Sarcopenia was not associated with higher rates of post-procedural complications nor impaired
safety of TAE, thus indicating that the increased mortality in sarcopenic patients was not the con￾sequence of technical complications of TAE. This finding has important clinical implications as it
highlights that pre-TAE sarcopenia should not be considered an exclusion criterion for the proce￾dure; on the contrary, it should prompt an effort to increase SMI aimed to OS improvement.
Among the strategies studied for the management and prevention of sarcopenia, only physical
exercise [20,21] has shown significant positive effects. A potential role for Creatine and Leucine
supplementation has been suggested but remains yet to be proven [22,23]. Thus, further well￾designed ad-hoc studies are needed [24], even if it might be difficult to conduct them in patients
with advanced liver disease, older age and significant extrahepatic comorbidities who are usually
the subgroups receiving TAE. Most importantly, given that sarcopenia was not the only factor
associated with mortality and that the other variables correlated to reduced survival are mostly
non-modifiable and intrinsically associated with late HCC diagnosis, it remains to be proven that
the exclusive correction of sarcopenia will have a positive effect in patients undergoing TAE.
There were some limitations to this study. Firstly, due to its retrospective nature, we could
not acquire information on the patient’s daily activities and diet, which may have influenced
the prevalence of sarcopenia. Secondly, data about the specific cause of patients’ death during
the follow-up period were not covered by our study; thus external factors may have influenced

the OS. Thirdly, only a small percentage of patients were not sarcopenic (15%), reflecting the
fact that sarcopenia is common in patients affected by advanced-stage HCC who are usually
the ideal candidates for TAE, but reducing the comparability of the two groups. Also, the treat￾ment history differed in the cohort we studied, thus potentially influencing the OS. However,
this should be considered representative of HCC patients who undergo embolization, as they
are frequently diagnosed at different stages, with TAE often being their first therapeutic option
before systemic therapy.
Noteworthy, the strengths of this study are the large cohort managed by the same group of
physicians, and the exclusion of patients who underwent any other HCC treatment during the
observation window, limiting the confounding effect on OS of other therapeutic interventions.
Conclusions
Sarcopenia, estimated by the L3SMI method, is an emerging prognostic factor in patients with
HCC undergoing bland TAE therapy as it is associated with increased mortality, without
impairing the safety of the locoregional treatment. Measures to ameliorate the SMI, such as

nutritional support and physical exercise, should be evaluated in clinical trials for HCC
patients receiving liver embolization to determine their impact on overall survival.
