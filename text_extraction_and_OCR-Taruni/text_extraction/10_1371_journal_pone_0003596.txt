Abstract
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can detect endogenous danger molecules released upon tissue injury resulting in the induction of
a proinflammatory response. One of the TLR family members, TLR4, is constitutively expressed at RNA level on renal
epithelium and this expression is enhanced upon renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The functional relevance of this
organ-specific upregulation remains however unknown. We therefore investigated the specific role of TLR4 and the relative
contribution of its two downstream signaling cascades, the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent cascades in renal
damage by using TLR42/2, MyD882/2 and TRIF-mutant mice that were subjected to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Our results show that TLR4 initiates an exaggerated proinflammatory response upon I/R injury, as reflected by lower levels
of chemokines and infiltrating granulocytes, less renal damage and a more preserved renal function in TLR42/2 mice as
compared to wild type mice. In vitro studies demonstrate that renal tubular epithelial cells can coordinate an immune
response to ischemic injury in a TLR4-dependent manner. In vivo we found that epithelial- and leukocyte-associated
functional TLR4 contribute in a similar proportion to renal dysfunction and injury as assessed by bone marrow chimeric
mice. Surprisingly, no significant differences were found in renal function and inflammation in MyD882/2 and TRIF-mutant
mice compared with their wild types, suggesting that selective targeting of TLR4 directly may be more effective for the
development of therapeutic tools to prevent I/R injury than targeting the intracellular pathways used by TLR4. In
conclusion, we identified TLR4 as a cellular sentinel for acute renal damage that subsequently controls the induction of an
innate immune response.

Introduction
Inflammation at the site of tissue injury is a hallmark of almost
all forms of renal injury and is an important factor in the
development of many kidney diseases. Inflammatory cells can
either mediate the initiation and progression of damage by direct
cytotoxicity, secretion of soluble factors and regulation of immune
responses, or can promote tissue repair and remodeling by
production of growth factors and clearance of injured cells. It has
become clear that renal epithelium plays a crucial role in the
attraction of leukocytes upon injury [1], at least partially in a Toll￾like receptor (TLR)-dependent manner [2].
The family of TLRs consists of highly conserved pattern
recognition receptors that detect specific pathogen-associated
molecular patterns such as peptidoglycan (TLR2) or lipopolysac￾charide (TLR4) [3]. Interestingly, TLRs also recognize specific
endogenous danger molecules that have been altered from their
native state or accumulate in non-physiologic sites or amounts
during tissue injury, such as heat-shock proteins, hyaluronan, high￾mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and fibrinogen [4]. Upon
ligand recognition, TLRs are activated and initiate a proinflam￾matory response by the release of cytokines/chemokines and
attraction of inflammatory cells [5,6]. Except for TLR3, all TLRs
control these innate immune responses through a conserved
downstream signaling pathway, starting with the translocation of
the adapter molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88)
that ultimately leads to the early activation of NFkB [7]. Besides
this pathway, TLR4 and TLR3 can use an alternative signaling
cascade, the MyD88-independent route [8], which specifically
involves the translocation of adapter molecule TRIF (TIR domain
–containing adapter inducing IFN-b) [9,10], in combination with
the adapter protein TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule) that
subsequently leads to the production of IFN- b and the expression
of Interferon b-inducible genes [11,12]. The diversity and
specificity of the function of TLRs is determined by the selective
use of these intracellular adapter molecules.
Where it was first thought that TLRs were mainly expressed on
antigen-presenting cells, recent observations demonstrate that
TLR mRNA expression is also present within solid organs such as
the heart, liver and kidney [13]. In the kidney, the majority of the

constitutive TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA is expressed by tubular
epithelial cells (TECs) and is enhanced upon renal ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) injury as shown by in situ hybridization [14].
Importantly, the endogenous ligands that can activate TLR2 and
TLR4 are strongly upregulated in these TECs upon I/R injury
[15]. Together, these data suggest a potential role for renal TLR2
and TLR4 in the primary mechanism through which the kidney
monitors renal injury and initiates and regulates inflammation.
Indeed, we already demonstrated that renal-associated TLR2
plays a proinflammatory and subsequent detrimental role during
I/R injury in the kidney of mice [2]. TLR4 can however exert
different immunological effects as demonstrated by studies
showing diverse effects of TLR2 and TLR4 in infection
[16,17,18] and tissue injury models [19,20]. This could be due
to the fact that TLR4 detects other (endogenous danger) ligands,
can signal via an alternative signaling cascade and does not
hybridize with other TLRs as TLR2 does. The particular role of
TLR4 in I/R injury remains therefore unknown. The definition of
the specific roles of the MyD88-dependent and –independent
pathways in TLR signaling might offer new possibilities for the
selective blockade of pathways downstream of TLRs. Together,
this prompted us to investigate the role of TLR4 and the relative
contribution of the two individual downstream signaling cascades
of TLR4 in I/R injury and repair in the kidney.
Results
Preserved renal function in TLR42/2 mice after I/R
induction
To evaluate the role of TLR4 in renal I/R injury, plasma urea
and creatinine levels were determined in TLR42/2 and wild
type mice. As shown in figure 1, I/R injury caused a transient
increase in urea and creatinine levels in wild type mice,
demonstrating a significant degree of renal dysfunction. Most
importantly however, TLR42/2 mice were partially protected
against renal dysfunction as reflected by significantly lower levels
of plasma urea and creatinine levels compared with wild type mice
one day after I/R injury. Five and ten days after I/R injury urea
and creatinine levels went almost back to sham levels, and no
differences were observed between TLR42/2 and wild types.
TLR4 deficiency diminishes tubular injury
In line with the preserved renal function in TLR42/2 mice,
kidneys from these animals showed significantly less renal tubular
damage such as widespread tubular necrosis, tubular dilatation,
brush border loss and cast formation in the outer medulla one day
after I/R injury compared with wild type kidneys (figure 2). Again,
no significant differences were found in renal damage five and ten
days after I/R injury between the TLR42/2 and wild type
kidneys when renal function was already restored.
Reduced influx of inflammatory cells in TLR42/2 kidneys
In order to obtain insight into the role of TLR4 in renal
inflammation, we compared granulocyte and macrophage influx in
kidneys of TLR42/2 and wild type mice by immunohistochem￾istry. Kidneys of wild type mice showed a transient increase in
granulocyte influx with a peak one day after I/R injury (figure 3).
Interestingly, TLR42/2 kidneys showed significantly lower
amounts of infiltrated granulocytes one and ten days after I/R
injury compared with wild type kidneys. Analysis of macrophage
influx revealed that there was an increased infiltration of these cells
in the corticomedullary region with a peak ten days after I/R injury
in kidneys which was similar in both TLR42/2 and wild type mice
(3.02060.862 vs. 3.24060.600 percentage staining/HPF).
Reduced amount of cytokines and chemokines in
TLR42/2 mice
To evaluate whether early differences in the influx of
granulocytes could be explained by differences in cytokine/
chemokine production, we determined the concentrations of
Keratinocyte Chemoattractant (KC) and Monocyte Chemoat￾tractant-1 (MCP-1) in kidney homogenates of TLR42/2 and
wild type mice one day after I/R injury. In accordance with the
lower amount of granulocytes in the TLR42/2 kidneys, the levels
of granulocyte chemoattractant KC were significantly reduced in
the TLR42/2 kidney homogenates compared with that of wild
type mice (figure 4). The levels of monocyte chemoattractant
MCP-1 did not differ between kidney homogenates of TLR42/2
and wild type mice one day after I/R injury.
Inflammatory response can be initiated by TECs via TLR4
in vitro
To evaluate whether renal epithelium can contribute to the
initiation of an inflammatory response upon I/R injury in a
TLR4-dependent manner, cultured primary tubular epithelial
cells from TLR42/2 and wild type kidneys were subjected to
simulated ischemia, and cytokine/chemokine levels were subse￾quently measured in the supernatant. As shown in figure 5, levels
of KC were significantly lower whereas levels of MCP-1 were

similar in the supernatant of TLR42/2 TECs compared with
wild type TECs when subjected to simulated ischemia. The levels
of TNF-a were below detection level. These data show that TLR4
on epithelial cells can indeed contribute to the induction of
proinflammatory responses upon ischemic injury in vitro.
Equal contribution of renal- and leukocyte- associated
TLR4 to I/R injury in vivo
In order to investigate whether the observed functional and
morphological differences between wild type and TLR42/2 mice
upon renal I/R injury could be ascribed to either renal epithelium￾associated TLR4 or leukocyte-associated TLR4, bone marrow
(BM) transplantation was performed to create chimeric mice. After
seven weeks of engraftment, at least 80% of the leukocyte

population of all mice consisted of donor-derived cells, indicating
extensive engraftment (data not shown). These mice were
subsequently subjected to severe renal I/R injury. It became clear
that mice with renal-associated TLR4 (WT+KO BM) showed an
equal degree of renal dysfunction compared to mice with
leukocyte-associated TLR4 (KO+WT BM) one day after I/R
injury as reflected by similar plasma levels of urea and creatinine
(figure 6a). In addition, semi quantitative scoring of PASD-stained
sections revealed that there was an equal level of renal injury
between both groups (figure 6b). These results suggest that both
renal-associated and leukocyte-associated TLR4 contribute to the
observed functional and morphological differences that resulted
from TLR4 deficiency upon renal I/R injury.
Role of TLR4 in TEC apoptosis and proliferation after I/R
injury
To investigate if TLR4 subsequently plays a role in repair and
regeneration processes after I/R injury, we determined the
amount of apoptotic and proliferating tubular epithelial cells in
kidneys from TLR42/2 and wild type mice. One and ten days
after I/R injury, the number of apoptotic TECs tended to be
lower in TLR42/2 kidneys compared to wild type kidneys
(figure 7a). Surprisingly, five days after I/R injury, the amount of
apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the TLR42/2 kidneys
compared with wild type kidneys. Using a BrdU-immunostaining,
a transient increase in the amount of proliferating tubular
epithelial cells could be observed with a peak five days after I/R
injury which was similar in both genotypes. However, ten days
after I/R injury there was a significant lower amount of
proliferating cells in the kidneys of TLR42/2 mice compared
with the wild types (figure 7b).
MyD88 or TRIF deficiency does not influence renal
function and granulocyte influx after I/R induction
After having established that TLR4 plays a key role in initiating
a proinflammatory response affecting renal function after I/R
induction, we were interested in the relative contribution of the
two separate downstream signaling cascades of TLR4 in renal I/R
injury, one that relies on MyD88, and one that is mediated by
TRIF. Since the differences in renal function, injury and

granulocyte influx between TLR42/2 and wild type mice was
most evident one day after I/R injury, further experiments were
carried out at this time point. MyD882/2 mice showed a
tendency towards decreased plasma urea and creatinine levels
compared with wild type mice (figure 8a+b). However, these
differences did not reach statistical significance. To verify these
data, we performed an independent experiment with wild type and
MyD882/2 mice and again did not find a significant difference
in renal function (51.6368.33 vs. 47.4263.88 mmol/l ureum and
126.00629.51 vs. 151.42615.34 mmol/l creatinine) between both
groups one day after I/R injury. The TRIF-mutant mice also did
not show any differences in urea and creatinine levels compared
with wild types (figure 8a+b). Moreover, no differences were
observed in tubular damage between MyD882/2 and wild type
mice (4.5760.14 vs. 4.7160.07) or TRIF-mutant and their wild
type mice (3.9060.52 vs. 3.3460.56) after I/R injury (figure 8c).
In line with renal function and histology, there were also no
differences in granulocyte influx between MyD882/2 and TRIF￾mutant mice compared with their wild types one day after I/R
injury (figure 8d).
Discussion
Upon renal I/R injury, inflammatory processes are abundant
and contribute to the subsequent enhancement of tubular injury.
Especially renal tubular epithelial cells are central players, since
injury of these cells can result in the local synthesis of
proinflammatory mediators and the subsequent attraction and
migration of inflammatory cells into the injured renal parenchyma
[1]. It is already demonstrated that tubular epithelial cells
constitutively express TLR2 and TLR4, whose expression levels
are upregulated upon I/R injury [14]. Whereas we have already
shown that TLR2 plays a proinflammatory and subsequent
detrimental role upon I/R injury in vivo contributing to renal
dysfunction and injury [2], the functional relevance of increased
TLR4 expression remains unknown. As TLR4 can recognize
other endogenous ligands than TLR2 [21], can use an alternative
signaling cascade [22] and does not hybridize with other TLR
family members as TLR2 does, the functional significance of
TLR4 during tissue injury could be different from TLR2. Indeed,
different effects of TLR2 and TLR4 were found in both infection
models [16,17,18] as in tissue injury models [19,20]. Therefore, in
this study we investigated the individual role of TLR4 upon renal
I/R injury and demonstrated that TLR4 plays a proinflammatory
role, as reflected by a reduced amount of infiltrating granulocytes
and the chemokine KC in kidneys of TLR42/2 mice compared
with wild type mice. Since an exaggerated inflammatory response
could lead to more severe tissue damage, this enhanced
inflammation could explain why TLR42/2 mice showed less
tubular injury and a more preserved renal function compared with
wild type mice upon I/R injury. These results are in line with
studies describing an import role for TLR4 in lung and hepatic I/
R injury models [23,24,20]. In addition, another study also reports
that activation of TLR4 mediates renal I/R injury [25].
Whereas our in vitro data showed that primary murine TECs
need TLR4 in order to produce significant amounts of cytokines/

and TRIF-mutant mice (black bars) did not differ compared with that of their wild type mice (white bars) one day after renal I/R as reflected by serum

chemokines after simulated ischemia, the use of chimeric mice in a
model of severe I/R injury revealed that there was a comparable
relative contribution of renal-associated and leukocyte-associated
TLR4 to the observed renal dysfunction and tubular injury in vivo.
These results are partially in contrast to the report of Wu et al.
which demonstrated that intrinsic renal cells play the dominant
role in mediating kidney damage. A possible explanation for this
discrepancy could be that the study of Wu et al. induced sublethal
renal ischemia, whereas we subjected our chimeric mice to
prolonged severe I/R injury. The abundant infiltration of
inflammatory cells during lethal I/R injury thereby might
overwhelm the primary response initiated by epithelium-derived
TLR4. Interestingly, Cunningham et al. showed that extrarenal
TLR4 rather than renal TLR4 mediated LPS-induced acute renal
failure [26]. Although this model used a microbial ligand instead
of endogenous stress molecules; it emphasizes the role extra-renal
TLR4 can play in the kidney during disease. Moreover, Tsung et
al. showed in a model of hepatic I/R injury that functional TLR4
signaling in non-parenchymal cells in particular is important for
recognizing the initial damage from ischemic cells.
The diversity and specificity of a TLR function is determined by
the selective use of the intracellular adapter molecules. The
definition of the specific roles of the MyD88-dependent and
TRIF–dependent pathways in TLR signaling might offer new
possibilities for the selective blockade of pathways downstream of
TLRs. We therefore investigated their relative contributions in vivo.
This revealed that the TRIF-dependent cascade does not play an
important role early after I/R injury, as reflected by a similar
degree of renal dysfunction, tubular injury and granulocyte influx
in the TRIF-mutant mice as compared with their wild types. That
would point towards a more important role for the MyD88-
dependent cascade in this model. Surprisingly however, we did not
find differences in renal function, tubular damage and in numbers
of infiltrating granulocytes between MyD882/2 and wild type
mice in two independent experiments. In accordance with our
observations, no important role for the TRIF-dependent pathway
upon renal I/R injury was found in a study of Shigeoka et al. [27],
whereas they did observe functional differences between wild type
and MyD882/2 mice. MyD882/26TRIF2/2 (double KO)
mice were found to have a similar phenotype as the MyD882/2
mice, suggesting that the TRIF-dependent pathway is indeed not
important.
From our data it became clear that the absence of TLR4
protected the kidneys to a higher degree that the absence of the
downstream signaling molecule MyD88. Shigeoka et al. observed
similar results showing that TLR2 deficiency provided more
protection than a deficiency in MyD88 or TRIF individually or a
combination of those two adapter molecules [27]. They suggested
the possible existence of additional TLR2-dependent/MyD88-
independent signaling pathways. Likewise, it seems reasonable that
there are also yet unknown TLR4-dependent/MyD88-indepen￾dent/TRIF-independent signaling pathways in this renal I/R
injury model. Moreover, it is known that other receptors, including
members of the Interleukin (IL)-1R/TLR superfamily such as IL1
and IL18, signal via the MyD88 adapter protein as well, and could
thereby abolish the proinflammatory effects of TLR4 signaling
[28,29]. An alternative explanation is that endogenous ligands that
are released upon I/R injury might activate other TLR-family
members signaling via the MyD88-dependent cascade that could
have an anti-inflammatory effect abolishing the proinflammatory
signal of TLR4. Indeed, it is already demonstrated that TLR9 can
trigger anti-inflammatory functions in experimental colitis [30],
and it has been shown that upon TLR-signaling the levels of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 can be enhanced within
dendritic cells [31]. Moreover, a study reported that individual
molecules of signaling pathways can differentially regulate the
TLR-mediated production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cyto￾kines [32]. Recent reports even suggested the existence of non￾TLR-dependent adapter molecules [33]. Obviously, further
experimental work is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms
through which TLR signaling leads to differential downstream
responses.
Besides the initiation of a proinflammatory response, we also
investigated if TLR4 activation was involved in the repair and
regenerative processes that take place upon I/R injury, such as the
clearance of damaged tubular epithelial cells by apoptosis and
subsequent replacement of epithelium by proliferation of TECs. In
contrast to the results we had already demonstrated for TLR2 [2],
these findings suggest that TLR4 does not play a major role in the
induction of apoptotic processes, despite a tendency towards less
apoptotic TECs found in the TLR42/2 mice after one day of I/
R injury. The latter would be in line with the less renal dysfunction
and less inflammation that were observed at this time in TLR4
deficient mice, since apoptosis is thought to contribute to the
initiation of reperfusion-induced inflammation and subsequent
tissue injury [34]. Interestingly, despite similar levels of tubular
injury five days after I/R injury, the amount of apoptotic cells was
significantly higher in kidneys of TLR42/2 mice compared with
wild type mice. This agrees with a previous study demonstrating
that TLR4 signaling protects against apoptosis in the injured
intestine [35]. Furthermore, in contrast to the effect what we
already described for TLR2 deficiency [2], no effect of TLR4
deficiency was found on the amount of proliferating TECs on
early time points, while after ten days of I/R injury the amount of
proliferating TECs was lower in the TLR42/2 mice compared to
wild type mice. This agrees with previous studies demonstrating
that TLR4 signaling is required for proliferation in the injured
intestine [35], and the demonstration that HSP60-mediated TLR4
activation stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation
[36]. However, apoptosis and proliferation of TECs do not appear
to contribute to the differences in renal function and morphology
that were observed between wild type and TLR42/2 mice one
day after renal I/R injury.
In conclusion, this study shows that TLR4 can initiate an
exaggerated proinflammatory response early after renal I/R
injury, contributing to renal injury and dysfunction, and indicates
that both epithelium-associated and leukocyte-associated TLR4
contribute to the I/R induced effects in vivo. As deficiency of the
intracellular adapter molecules MyD88 and TRIF did not
influence the degree of renal injury and inflammation, selective
targeting of TLR4 may be more effective for the development of
therapeutic tools to prevent I/R injury than targeting the
intracellular pathways used by TLR4. Moreover, these findings
support the idea that the function of TLRs extends beyond host
defense against invading pathogens; TLR4 seems to be a cellular
sensor for acute renal damage that controls innate immunity and
tissue integrity.

TLR42/2, MyD882/2 and TRIF-mutant mice were originally
generated as described previously [37,38,39], and the correct
phenotype was revealed by genotypic screening. The CD45.1
positive allotype wild type mice used to create chimeric mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (B6.SJL-Ptprca
Pepcb
/
BoyCrl strain). Only age- and sex-matched mice were used in all
experiments. The Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Amsterdam approved all experiments.
In vivo Ischemia/Reperfusion
Renal I/R injury was induced as described previously [40].
Briefly, both renal arteries were clamped for 45 minutes using
micro aneurysm clamps through a midline abdominal incision
under general anesthesia (0.07 ml/10 g mouse of fentanyl citrate
fluanisone midazolam mixture containing: 1.25 mg/ml midazo￾lam (Roche Diagnostics Corp.), 0.08 mg/ml fentanyl citrate, and
2.5 mg/ml fluanisone (Janssen Pharmaceutica)). After clamp
removal, kidneys were inspected for restoration of blood flow.
The abdomen was closed in 2 layers, and all mice received a
subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg buprenorphin (Temgesic;
Schering-Plough) for analgetic purposes and were allowed to
recover from surgery for 12 hours at 28uC in a ventilated stove. To
maintain fluid balance and volume status, mice were supplement￾ed with a few drops sterile 0.9% NaCl intra-peritoneal. Sham￾operated mice underwent the same procedure without clamping
and were sacrificed one day after surgery. To mark proliferating
cells, 5-bromo-29-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) was inject￾ed intraperitoneally (30–50 mg/kg body wt) 60 minutes before
sacrifice. Mice were sacrificed 1, 5, and 10 days after surgery. At
these time points, mice were weighed; blood was collected by heart
puncture in heparin-containing tubes and after 10 minutes
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm stored at 280uC. Kidneys were
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in 280uC till further
analysis.
Plasma biochemical analysis
Plasma urea and creatinine levels were determined by routinely
used clinical diagnostic urease and creatinase assays.
Primary culture of mouse renal tubular epithelial cells
Kidneys from wild type (n = 4) and TLR42/2 (n = 5) mice
were harvested and the capsule was removed. Tissue from the
outer cortex was cut into pieces of approximately 1 mm3
, and
subsequently prepared by 1 mg/ml Collagenase type 1A (Sigma￾Aldrich) dispersion at 37uC for 1 hour. After washing, primary
TECs were grown to confluence on 6-well plates in HK2 culture
medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen
Corp.), 1% ITSe and 1% S1 hormone mixture (Sigma). The
nature of primary cells was confirmed by culturing cells on glass
slides that subsequently were stained for markers specific for
different cell types. The majority of cells were positive for E￾cadherin and ZO-1, whereas staining for a-SMA, F4/80 and
CD68 remained negative (data not shown).
In vitro simulated ischemia
Cultured primary TECs in 6-well plates were washed twice with
PBS to remove waste products, and ischemia was simulated by
immersing the cellular monolayer in mineral oil for 1 hour at
37uC as done before [2,41]. Control cell monolayers remained in
HK-2 medium. After extensive washing, cells were incubated for
24 hours in HK-2 medium. Supernatants were collected and
stored at 280uC until ELISAs were performed (see below). The
total amount of cells present in the wells after simulated ischemia
was counted using a Coulter Counter (Beckman).
Preparing kidney homogenate
For cytokine and chemokine measurements, snap-frozen
kidneys were homogenized in Greenberger lysis buffer (containing
150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl?H2O, 1 mM CaCl2
and 1% Triton-X, combined with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma)), homogenized and incubated for 30 minutes at 4uC. The
homogenates were subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
10 minutes, after which the supernatants were stored at 280uC
until ELISAs were performed. To determine protein content, the
Bio-Rad Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad laboratories) was used
with IgG as standard.
ELISA
Cytokine (TNF-a) and chemokines (KC and MCP-1) were
measured using the specific ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according
the manufactures protocol. The detection limits were 31 pg/ml for
TNF- a, 13 pg/ml for KC and 16 pg/ml for MCP-1.
Scoring of histopathology
All histopathological scorings were made in the cortex using
PAS-D–stained renal tissue sections and performed on coded
slides. The percentage of damaged tubules in the corticomedullary
junction was estimated by a blinded pathologist using a 5-point
scale according to the following criteria: tubular dilatation, cast
deposition, brush border loss, and necrosis in 10 randomly chosen,
non-overlapping fields (6400). Lesions were graded on a scale
from 0 to 5: 0 = normal; 1 = mild, involvement of less than 10% of
the cortex; 2 = moderate, involvement of 10 to 25% of the cortex;
3 = severe, involvement of 25 to 50% of the cortex; 4 = very severe,
involvement of 50–75% of cortex; 5 = extensive damage, involve￾ment of more than 75% of the cortex.
Detection of granulocytes and macrophages
Renal tissues were fixed for 24 hours in 10% formalin and
embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 mm were deparaffinized and
endogenous peroxidase was subsequently blocked using methanol
with 0.3% H2O2. After digestion with a solution of 0.25% pepsin
into 0,1 M HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) for granulocytes or with 0.1%
Trypsin (BDH Chemicals) into PBS for macrophages, non-specific
binding was blocked by incubation with 5% normal goat serum
(Dako Cytomation) within phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
Sections were exposed to FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ly6G mAb
(BD Biosciences–Pharmingen) or rat anti-mouse F4/80 IgG2b
mAb (Serotec) overnight at 4uC. For staining of granulocytes,
slides were incubated with rabbit anti-FITC antibody (Dako
Cytomation), which was followed by a further incubation with
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Immunovision Technolo￾gies Co.). For macrophage staining, slides were incubated with
rabbit anti-rat biotin (DakoCytomation), which was followed by
streptavidin-ABC solution (DakoCytomation). The slides were
developed using 1% H2O2 and DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05 M
Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and counterstained with Methyl Green (Sigma￾Aldrich). For granulocytes the number of positive cells was
counted within 10 non-overlapping fields (6400). The amount of
positive macrophage staining was quantified digitally with Image
Pro Plus software version 5.0.
Detection of apoptosis and proliferation
Tissue sections of kidneys were deparaffinized and boiled for
10 minutes in 10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA (pH 9.0). Nonspecific
TLR4 in Renal I/R Injury
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3596

binding and endogenous peroxidase activity were blocked as
described above, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-human
active caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology),
followed by a further incubation with HRP-conjugated goat-anti
rabbit IgG (ImmunoVision Technologies Co.), and further
processed as described above. To stain for BrdU, DNA was
denatured in 2 M HCl, and antigen retrieval was performed by
0.4% pepsin in 0.01 M HCl. Sections were then incubated in 5%
normal goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and exposed to mouse IgG1
anti-BrdU antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). This was followed by a
further incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (South￾ernBiotech). Finally, sections were developed as described above.
The number of positive cells was counted within 10 non￾overlapping fields (6400).
Bone marrow transplantation
Total bone marrow was collected from TLR42/2 (C57Bl/6
background, CD45.2 alloantigen positive on circulating leuko￾cytes) and wild type mice (alloantigen CD45.1 positive on
circulating leukocytes (B6.SJL-Ptprca
Pepcb
/BoyCrl), purchased
from Charles River, Netherlands) [42] by flushing femurs and
tibiae with sterile PBS containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. To ensure short-term survival of the
recipients, single cell suspension of a syngeneic spleen from a
CD45.1 wild type or TLR42/2 mice was obtained by crushing
spleens in PBS containing 10% FCS, penicillin and streptomycin
through a 40-mm cell strainer (BD). Male TLR42/2 (n = 9) and
wild type (n = 7) recipients were lethally irradiated with two doses
of 5Gy, separated by 4 hours, using a 137Cs irradiator (CIS bio
international; SCHERING S.A.). After the last irradiation dose,
56106 TLR42/2 or CD45.1 wild type bone marrow cells and
26105 TLR42/2 or CD45.1 wild type spleen cells in sterile PBS
were injected into the tail vein of recipient irradiated mice. These
mice were kept in micro isolator cages for 7 weeks to complete
engraftment with donor bone marrow, after which renal I/R
injury was induced as described above. One week prior and 5
weeks following transplantation, mice received sterile acidified tap
water (1261023 M HCl) containing 0.16% neomycin sulphate
(Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent the immunocompromised recipients
from infections.
FACS analysis
To assay bone marrow reconstitution, whole blood was
collected from recipients when sacrificed and subsequently
analyzed by flow cytometry to determine donor/recipient
chimerism of the hematopoietic compartment. Erythrocytes were
lysed for 10 minutes at 4uC in 160 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3
and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and the remaining leukocytes were
brought to a concentration of 46106 cells/ml FACS buffer (PBS
supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 0.01% NaN3 and 100 mM EDTA)
and stained for CD45.1 (clone A20, BD Biosciences) and CD45.2
(clone 104, BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4uC. Chimerism was
determined by analyzing the populations of CD45.1 and CD45.2
positive cells. To correct for background staining unlabeled cells
were used. All analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD)
and WinMDI 2.5 software.
Statistics
Differences between groups were analyzed using the indepen￾dent samples T-Test. Values are expressed as mean6SEM. A
value of P,0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
