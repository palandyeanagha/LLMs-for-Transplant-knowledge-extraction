Abstract
Background: Computed tomography (CT) lung densitometry has been demonstrated to be the most sensitive and
specific outcome measure for the assessment of emphysema-modifying therapy, but the optimum densitometric index
has yet to be determined and targeted sampling may be more sensitive than whole lung assessment. The EXAcerbations
and CT scan as Lung Endpoints (EXACTLE) trial aimed to clarify the optimum approach to the use of CT densitometry
data for the assessment of alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy on the progression of emphysema in AAT
deficiency (AATD).
Methods: Patients with AATD (n = 77) were randomised to weekly infusions of 60 mg/kg human AAT (Prolastin®) or
placebo over 2 to 2.5 years. Lung volume was included as a covariate in an endpoint analysis and a comparison was made
of different CT densitometric indices (15th percentile lung density [PD15], mean lung density [MLD] and voxel index at
a threshold of -910 [VI-910] and -950 [VI-950] Hounsfield Units) obtained from whole lung scans at baseline and at 24
to 30 months. Targeted regional sampling was compared with whole lung assessment.
Results: Whole lung analysis of the total change (baseline to last CT scan) compared with placebo indicated a
concordant trend that was suggestive of a treatment effect for all densitometric indices (MLD [1.402 g/L, p = 0.204]; VI￾910 [-0.611, p = 0.389]; VI-950 [-0.432, p = 0.452]) and that was significant using PD15 (1.472 g/L, p = 0.049). Assessment
of the progression of emphysema in the apical, middle and basal regions of the lung by measurement with PD15 showed
that this treatment effect was more evident when the basal third was sampled (1.722 g/L, p = 0.040). A comparison
between different densitometric indices indicated that the influence of inspiratory variability between scans was greatest
for PD15, but when adjustment for lung volume was made this index was the most sensitive measure of emphysema
progression.
Conclusion: PD15 is the most sensitive index of emphysema progression and of treatment modification. Targeted
sampling may be more sensitive than whole lung analysis.

Background
Computed tomographic (CT) imaging is the most sensi￾tive and specific method for diagnosis of emphysema in
vivo [1,2]. In addition, it provides quantitative data that
correlate with pathological morphometry [3-6] and has
been shown to be a valid tool for monitoring emphysema
in clinical studies of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
(AATD) [7,8]. In recent years, there has been greater
understanding and acceptance of this relatively novel
technique, but there is limited published evidence to sup￾port the contention that one methodological approach to
CT densitometry is superior to another. In particular, the
majority of data have been obtained from observational
cohorts [7-12], and it cannot be assumed that the conclu￾sions of these studies may be extrapolated to interven￾tional trials.
The EXACTLE (EXAcerbations and CT scan as Lung End￾points) trial [13] was undertaken to explore the role of CT
densitometry as a potential primary outcome measure in
the setting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
the effect of alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation ther￾apy on the progression of emphysema in individuals with
AATD (PiZ) over 24 to 30 months. The study concluded
that CT densitometry was a more sensitive and robust out￾come measure than physiology, health status and exacer￾bation frequency, and demonstrated that the method for
controlling the variability arising from differences in
inspiratory level was of importance in demonstrating a
treatment effect [10,13].
Additional CT methodological issues were explored in the
EXACTLE study and the findings are reported here. These
included the identification of the most discriminating
densitometric index for use as an outcome measure. Fur￾thermore, the role of regional densitometry was compared
with whole lung densitometric assessment in order to
determine whether targeted sampling was more appropri￾ate for a pathological process that may be localised, and
whether there could be regional differences in treatment
effect.
Methods
Subjects
Patients with pulmonary emphysema due to severe con￾genital AATD of phenotype PiZ were recruited from AAT
registries in Denmark, the UK and Sweden. Eligible
patients were at least 18 years of age, had a history of at
least 1 exacerbation in the past 2 years, had a post-bron￾chodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥
25% and ≤ 80% predicted and a ratio of post-bronchodi￾lator FEV1 to slow vital capacity (VC) ≤ 0.70, or a carbon
monoxide transfer coefficient (DLCO/VA) of ≤ 80% of the
predicted value, as previously reported [13]. All patients
gave written informed consent. The study was approved
by relevant local ethics review committees and was con￾ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
Study design
This multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, dou￾ble-blind, parallel-group study was conducted at 3 centres
in Copenhagen (Denmark), Birmingham (UK) and
Malmö (Sweden). Eligible patients were randomly
assigned, in permuted blocks with stratification according
to country, to weekly infusions of either AAT (Prolastin® 60
mg/kg body weight) or placebo (2% concentration of
albumin) for 24 months, as previously described [13]. CT
scans were performed at baseline and at 12 and 24
months, with an option for continuation and an addi￾tional scan at 30 months.
CT densitometry
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression of emphy￾sema determined by change in lung density measured by
CT scan of the whole lung as previously reported [13].
Based on earlier studies [7,10,11,14] and recommenda￾tions of an expert review [15], the 15th percentile point
was chosen as the parameter for the primary endpoint and
expressed as the 15th percentile lung density (PD15). The
15th percentile point is defined as the value (Hounsfield
Units) below which the 15% of voxels with the lowest
density are distributed (Figure 1), and it may be expressed
as PD15 (g/L) by the simple addition of 1000 to the
Hounsfield value of the 15th percentile point. Other effi￾cacy endpoints included the following additional densit￾ometric indices extracted from the frequency distribution
histogram of lung voxels: mean lung density (MLD), voxel
index at a threshold of -910 Hounsfield Units (VI-910),
and voxel index at a threshold of -950 Hounsfield Units
(VI-950; Figure 1).
CT image acquisition
Multidetector CT scans of the chest were performed fol￾lowing inhaled bronchodilator therapy in the supine
position during a breath-hold manoeuvre as close as pos￾sible to total lung capacity. All scanning was performed
without intra-venous contrast in a caudo-cranial direction
and with the arms held above the head in order to reduce
artifacts. Scan acquisition parameters were standardized
using the preferred scanning parameters 140 kVp, 40 mA,
and pitch 1.5, with reconstructed slice thickness of 5 mm
and with an increment of 2.5 mm but taking account of
the scanner differences that existed between the 3 centres
[13 and associated supplementary information]. Radia￾tion per CT scan was low at around 1 mSv.
Mandatory scanner air calibration was performed accord￾ing to the scanner manufacturers' instructions within 3
hours of the first patient scan, and every 3 hours during

Respiratory Research 2009, 10:75 http://respiratory-research.com/content/10/1/75

scanning lists. Mandatory water calibration was per￾formed by the manufacturers (using the manufacturers'
water phantom) at least every 3 months using the clinical
scan protocol. Additional quality assurance was achieved
using a dedicated Perspex and foam phantom that was
scanned prior to site initiation, the first patient scan at
each site, and every 6 months throughout the study.
Raw data were reconstructed using an edge-smoothing
image reconstruction algorithm and were saved in
DICOM format on CD for shipment to a central facility
(Heart Core Global Medical Imaging) for densitometric
analysis using dedicated software (Pulmo-CMS) as previ￾ously described [13 and associated supplementary infor￾mation].
CT endpoints
Prior to un-blinding, a review panel assessed CT scan data
to identify invalid scans due to technical issues [13 and
associated supplementary information]. The progression
of densitometric indices was estimated using an endpoint
analysis using the first and last CT scans and incorporating
adjustment for lung volume, as described below (see Sta￾tistical Analysis).
Progression was assessed for whole lung and for the api￾cal, middle and basal regions. Subdivision of a whole lung
series into apical, middle and basal thirds of approximate
equal volume was achieved by dividing the whole lung
into 12 segments of equal volume. The most apical and
basal segments were excluded from further analysis
because image artifact is recognised to be greatest in these
anatomical locations [16]. The remaining 10 segments
were divided into the 'basal region' (the 4 most caudal
segments), the 'apical region' (the 3 most cranial seg￾ments) and the 'middle region' (the intervening 3 seg￾ments).
Statistical analysis
All CT scan analyses were based on the modified intent￾to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomised
subjects who received the study therapy and had at least 1
valid CT scan measurement at baseline and 1 valid CT
scan assessment at Month 12 or thereafter [13].

Treatment differences (Prolastin versus placebo) were
tested using an analysis of covariance approach, with the
change from baseline to the last CT scan measurement in
lung density as the dependent variable, treatment and
centre as fixed factors, and change in logarithm of CT￾measured TLV and baseline measurement as covariates, as
previously described [10,13]. This statistical model, in
which lung volume attained during scan acquisition was
log-transformed before it was used as a covariate, was
applied to the analyses for all of the different densitomet￾ric indices. In contrast to the case when PD15 is used as
the densitometric index, where log-transformed TLV is
routinely used as a covariate in the statistical model, the
optimum lung volume adjustment method for the voxel
index parameters has not been established. Consequently,
in the absence of any alternative, the same volume adjust￾ment method was used for the voxel index as for PD15 in
this study.
Sensitivity ratios were determined for each of the densito￾metric indices by dividing the value for the mean change
from baseline in lung density by the standard error to
obtain a sensitivity index. Sensitivity ratios measured by
PD15 were also determined for the 3 lung regions. These
data were obtained from analysis of the placebo group
only. In order to establish the influence of inspiratory
level on the different densitometric indices, additional
sensitivity measurements were carried out in a post-hoc
analysis without the lung volume adjustment.
Results
Patient characteristics at baseline
In total, of the 82 patients enrolled into the study from the
3 centres, 77 patients were randomised to Prolastin (n =
38) or placebo (n = 39), and 71 patients (n = 36, Prolastin;
n = 35, placebo) were included in the mITT population.
The number of patients in the ITT population who com￾pleted the study was 67, and 10 patients (3 in the Prolas￾tin group and 7 in the placebo group) discontinued
prematurely, resulting in a median of 127 weeks of expo￾sure to Prolastin and 108 weeks to placebo. The study was
completed by 92% of patients in the Prolastin group and
82% of patients in the placebo group (ITT population), as
described previously [13].
Demographics and disease severity at baseline for all ran￾domised patients are summarised in Table 1. Complete
descriptive details have been previously reported [13]. CT
data indicate that the majority of patients had predomi￾nantly basal emphysema and that there were no signifi￾cant differences in lung density between the Prolastin and
placebo groups at baseline (Table 1).
CT densitometric progression
All CT scan data were reviewed prior to study analysis in a
blinded fashion to identify densitometric values that
might be invalid because of technical issues, as previously
described [13]. A total of 15 scans were invalid, which
resulted in 6 patients having only 1 CT scan; these patients
were therefore excluded from the mITT population.
Comparison of densitometric indices
The mean decline in lung density was determined and
adjusted for lung volume, as described above (see Meth￾ods). All CT densitometric indices demonstrated a signifi￾cant decline in both the Prolastin and placebo groups over
the course of the study, consistent with emphysema pro￾gression (Table 2). The changes in PD15 from baseline to
last CT scan were -2.645 g/L (Prolastin group) and -4.117
g/L (placebo group), indicating a significant treatment
effect (p = 0.049) (Table 2). A trend towards a slower rate
of decline in the Prolastin group was indicated when pro￾Table 1: Patient characteristics at baseline (ITT population)

gression was assessed using MLD, VI-910 and VI-950,
although the difference between the 2 treatment groups
did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.204, p =
0.389 and p = 0.452, respectively; Table 2).
The sensitivity ratios (whole lung assessment) measured
for each of the densitometric parameters are shown in
Table 3. PD15 was observed to be the most sensitive meas￾ure of emphysema progression.
Regional densitometry
A significant decline in values for PD15 was observed in
all 3 lung regions in both treatment groups during the
study (Table 4). In the placebo arm, the rate of emphy￾sema progression was comparable between the apical,
middle and basal regions, whereas in the active treatment
arm, the rate of emphysema progression in the basal
region was lower than that of either the apical or middle
regions. A significant treatment effect was demonstrated
in the basal region (p = 0.040) and concordant trends
were observed in the middle and apical regions, although
these failed to achieve statistical significance (p = 0.155
and p = 0.673, respectively) (Table 4 and Figure 2). The
sensitivity ratios showed that analysis by PD15 of the
basal region was a significantly more sensitive measure
than analysis of the apical region (Table 5).
Effect of inspiratory level
A predefined correction for differences in inspiratory level
between scans was applied as described in the Methods

indices that was greatest for PD15 (Table 3).
Discussion
The EXACTLE trial was designed to explore the use of CT
densitometry as an outcome measure for the assessment
of plasma AAT augmentation therapy in individuals with
AATD. The analytical approach, and the principal techni￾cal issues that were addressed, were a logical sequence to
previous studies within this field [7-12,14,17-21] and
were integral to the design and statistical analysis plan of
the EXACTLE trial [13]. The primary endpoint was the dif￾ference in lung density decline as a result of treatment,
assessed from whole lung CT imaging and expressed as
PD15, as reported previously [13].
Densitometric indices
The current study included a comparison of the more
commonly used densitometric indices to identify whether
the advantages of the 15th percentile method, which have
been demonstrated in observational studies, would also

be evident in an interventional study. Previous studies
have validated the use of several densitometric indices for
the measurement of emphysema [4-6,22] and, although
the 15th percentile method has not been compared
directly with a pathological standard, clinical studies
[7,10,14] support the theoretical advantages of this
method [23] over the use of other indices. The sensitivity
of the voxel index method has been shown in longitudi￾nal studies to be influenced by the voxel index threshold
[12,14] and by the severity of emphysema [7]. In contrast,
the sensitivity of the percentile method is relatively inde￾pendent of the chosen centile [14] and is a more consist￾ent measure of emphysema progression across a wide
spectrum of disease severity [7]. Furthermore, the correla￾tion between the rate of reduction in lung density and the
decline in FEV1 has been shown to be greater when the
15th percentile method is used [7]. This may reflect the
better sensitivity of this measure of emphysema progres￾sion than the voxel index at a threshold of -950 and -
910HU [10]. In the current study, a determination of the
sensitivity ratios for the different densitometric indices
confirms that the 15th percentile method is a more sensi￾Table 4: Changes in PD15 (g/L) in basal, middle and apical regions of the lung in patients treated with Prolastin versus placebo (mITT

tive measure of emphysema progression than the voxel
index method.
The results of the present study indicate that, following
the adjustment of density values to correct for differences
in inspiratory level [10,13], a significant decline in lung
density is evident using all of the indices included, con￾sistent with emphysema progression. A trend suggestive of
a treatment effect was demonstrated for all indices and
was statistically significant when lung density was
assessed using PD15, as previously reported [13]. These
findings confirm the results of previous studies [7,10,14]
and provide yet further data that endorse the principle for
using the percentile density method rather than the voxel
index for monitoring studies [23], supporting the views of
an expert panel [15].
However, notwithstanding this finding, the data indicate
that differences in inspiratory level have a greater influ￾ence on PD15 than on the other indices included in the
current study. Consequently, the incorporation of a
method for correcting differences in lung volume between
scans is more critical when PD15 is used.
Regional densitometry
The rate of emphysema progression and treatment effect
in different regions of the lung were also assessed by the
15th percentile method in the current study. It is of inter￾est that, although the majority of subjects were shown to
have predominantly basal emphysema at baseline, statis￾tically significant decline in lung density was demon￾strated in all 3 lung regions consistent with the
progression of emphysema throughout the lung, as previ￾ously shown in an observational study [10]. The progres￾sion of emphysema identified in the placebo arm was
similar in all lung regions and consistently greater than
that seen in the treatment arm. However, this difference
was only statistically significant in the basal region (p =
0.040), and targeted densitometric sampling of the basal
region was shown to be more discriminative of a treat￾ment effect than whole lung assessment. In addition, a
significantly lower sensitivity index was obtained for
PD15 assessment of the apical region compared with the
basal region.
These data are of critical importance; not only do they
provide information on the natural history of emphysema
progression, but they may also influence the design and
interpretation of future studies. Emphysema is under￾stood to be a slowly progressive condition characterised
by the development of specific patterns of disease distri￾bution. These distribution patterns are viewed as pathog￾nomonic of pathological sub-type and, as more recently
implicated, of predisposing genotype [24,25]. Centrilobu￾lar emphysema is the most frequent pathological type that
occurs in subjects with usual chronic obstructive pulmo￾nary disease and is typically located towards the apical
region [26,27], whereas the most common pathological
type in subjects with AATD is panlobular emphysema,
which is typically distributed in the basal region
[16,27,28]. Although this is likely an oversimplification,
and the 2 principal pathological types may co-exist
[29,30], the pattern of emphysema distribution in the
early stages of disease conforms to this description in the
majority of individuals. As the disease progresses, it is
likely that the extension of emphysema from these initial
sites into unaffected areas will occur in a predictable
sequence until, in severe disease, it becomes increasingly
difficult to identify the initial pattern of distribution and
the pathological sub-type [16].
There is no evidence to date that indicates a spatial differ￾ential susceptibility to the development and progression
of emphysema within an individual lung, but no explana￾tion has been offered to account for the localised develop￾ment of emphysema that leads to the patterns of disease
distribution described above. However, it is logical that
the sites of initial disease must represent areas of the lung
with increased potential susceptibility to emphysematous
damage, since these areas are seemingly affected many
years in advance of the remaining lung, and this pattern
appears consistent across different patient populations.
The current study supports the contention that there may
be subtle differences in the pathogenesis of emphysema
according to regional location within the lung, since the
data clearly indicate a graded response to therapeutic aug￾mentation of AAT. The graded therapeutic effect that was
most evident in the basal region may indicate that the pro￾gression of panlobular emphysema might be retarded to a
greater extent than the progression of centrilobular
emphysema, since these 2 pathological sub-types are typ￾ically polarised towards the basal and apical regions,
respectively. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform
a visual classification of emphysema sub-type in our
cohort because the CT protocol that was used for the cur￾rent study was intended for densitometric fidelity rather
than optimum spatial resolution. However, previous
descriptive studies have shown that apical centrilobular
emphysema is evident in approximately half of subjects
with PiZ AATD [30]. Whilst the above explanation for the
data seems most plausible, alternative explanations may
be proposed. For example, the tissue concentration of AAT
may be greater in the basal region, since improved drug
delivery would be anticipated by the greater pulmonary
blood flow that is understood to exist in this region. Nev￾ertheless, future studies will be required to address these
issues.
Conclusion
We have confirmed that PD15 is the most discriminative
densitometric index for use in studies of emphysema￾modifying therapy. Emphysematous destruction of the

lung is understood to be heterogeneous, and pathogno￾monic patterns of emphysema distribution have been
described. However, the current study shows that emphy￾sema progression, as assessed by densitometry, occurs
consistently throughout the whole lung. Importantly, the
rate of lung density decline was reduced by the intrave￾nous augmentation of plasma with AAT when assessed
using PD15, the most sensitive parameter. Furthermore,
the greatest effect was evident in the classically involved
basal region of the lung, and targeted sampling may there￾fore be more sensitive in detecting a benefit of treatment
on emphysema progression than whole lung assessment.
