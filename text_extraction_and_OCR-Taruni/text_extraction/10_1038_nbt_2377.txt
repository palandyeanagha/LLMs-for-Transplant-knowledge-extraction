To the Editor:
Mass spectrometry–based proteomics 
has become an important component of 
biological research. Numerous proteomics 
methods have been developed to identify 
and quantify the proteins in biological 
and clinical samples1, identify pathways 
affected by endogenous and exogenous 
perturbations2 and characterize protein 
complexes3. Despite successes, the 
interpretation of vast proteomics data 
sets remains a challenge. There have 
been several calls for improvements and 
standardization of proteomics data analysis 
frameworks, as well as for an application￾programming interface for proteomics data 
access4,5. In response, we present here the 
ProteoWizard Toolkit, a robust set of open￾source, software libraries and applications 
designed to facilitate proteomics research. 
The libraries implement the first-ever, 
noncommercial, unified data access 
interface for proteomics, bridging field￾standard open formats and all common 
vendor formats. In addition, diverse 
software classes enable rapid development 
of vendor-agnostic proteomics software. 
Additionally, ProteoWizard projects 
and applications, building upon the core 
libraries, are becoming standard tools for 
enabling significant proteomics inquiries.
Historically, the development of 
proteomics software tools has been 
hindered by three factors: first, developers 
must develop readers and writers for the 
numerous file formats used for holding 
mass spectrometry data and analysis results, 
which range from vendor-specific mass 
spectrometry data formats to software 
application–specific formats; second, 
developers must implement numerous 
common, but critical algorithms (e.g., 
protein digestion, mass computation, 
peak integration, charge-state detection 
and isotope deconvolution), which is both 
time-consuming and error-prone; and 
third, comparison and validation of analysis 
algorithms is complicated by the vast 
diversity of possible workflows. Together, 
these three impediments create a significant 
bottleneck in the development of new 
proteomics software applications. Beyond 
slowing the pace of proteomics software 
development, these impediments have 
also hampered the field of proteomics by 
interfering in the meaningful comparison, 
sharing and exchange of data analyses 
obtained on different platforms or by 
different laboratories.
Efforts to mitigate these issues led 
initially to the development of several 
‘open’ interchange formats6,7 and a series 
of software tools that extracted data from 
vendor formats into open formats. The 
majority of mass spectrometry vendors also 
now provide approaches to export their 
data to open formats. Although this is an 
important step forward, both the academic 
and commercial tools suffer from a few 
limitations. For example, despite extensive 
conversion tools, a robust code-base 
that allowed developers to easily extract 
data from data files for use in their own 
applications did not exist. Efforts by our 
group and by the OpenMS team attempted 
to address this issue8,9. In addition, early 
converters depended upon instrument 
control software libraries; consequently, 
users without instruments could neither 
access nor convert vendor data files. 
Furthermore, each vendor format had its 
own converter (e.g., MassWolf for Waters 
Files and ReAdW for Thermo Fisher files), 
thus complicating software maintenance. 
Lastly, despite the amazing success of 
these open formats and the proliferation of 
tools that use them, the converter-centric, 
common-format approach did not address 
the issue of direct access to primary raw 
data. Most native vendor formats encode 
valuable, but vendor-specific, metadata 
including details of instrument settings and 
instrument readouts.
Direct access to raw, primary data 
can critically affect the comparability of 
experimental platforms because common 
computational processing steps associated 
with export, such as centroiding, may affect 
benchmarking results. The comparison 
challenge is even more important for data 
analysis approaches; a bioinformatics 
approach could easily appear inferior 
because of unintended (possibly error￾filled) upstream data processing steps. 
Lastly, cross-platform comparison of 
workflows (both computational and 
experimental) is hampered when tools are 
developed to read files from a particular 
vendor but cannot be applied to data 
from other instrument types. As the field 
of proteomics attempts to become more 
robust, the need for integrated pipelines 
A cross-platform toolkit for mass spectrometry and 
proteomics
for processing and analyzing complex 
proteomics data sets in a platform-agnostic 
manner has become critical.
With version 3.0 of the ProteoWizard 
Toolkit8, we attempt to mitigate these 
challenges through open-source, 
permissively licensed, cross-platform 
software. The Toolkit has two components: 
first, a suite of libraries that facilitate the 
development and comparison of tools for 
proteomics data analysis; and second, a set 
of tools, developed using these libraries, 
that performs a wide array of common 
proteomics analyses. The Toolkit has been 
developed under modern design principles 
in the C++ language and supports a 
variety of platforms with native compilers 
(GCC on Linux, MSVC on Windows and 
XCode on OSX). The toolkit was released 
under the Apache 2.0 license10 to ensure 
that it can be used in both academic and 
commercial projects. New to ProteoWizard 
3.0 and unlike previous efforts, vendor 
reader libraries are now directly distributed 
with the Toolkit independently of 
instrument control libraries (a further 
description of new features can be found 
in Supplementary Text 1). Furthermore, 
ProteoWizard employs a single converter 
and access interface for all formats; this 
singular point of maintenance allows a more 
stable and optimized set of tools. Additional 
robustness comes from ProteoWizard’s 
use of a continuous integration and testing 
environment. Although common in 
commercial projects, this scale of quality 
assurance is uncommon in traditional 
academic projects.
ProteoWizard is built upon a modular 
framework of many independent libraries 
grouped in dependency levels (Fig. 1a). 
Each library only depends on libraries 
in lower levels of the hierarchy. The data 
layer provides a unified access interface 
to mass spectrometry data, independent 
of the format-specific details associated 
with a given source file. The underlying 
data model of the data layer directly 
translates Human Proteome Organization 
Proteomics Standard Initiative (HUPO￾PSI) data elements to C++ data structures. 
In Supplementary Text 2, we show this 
mapping for a piece of the msData module 
that implements mzML11; equivalent 
mappings exist for mzIdentML12 and 
TraML7.

of other proteomics software efforts. As 
vendors frequently change their file formats 
to accommodate new instruments and 
public standards evolve rapidly, software 
tools can rapidly become unusable unless 
substantial resources are devoted to 
continually update data-reader code. The 
robust upkeep of ProteoWizard, in concert 
with its widespread use, will effectively 
reduce the investment that the public has to 
make in maintaining the longevity of open￾source software.
Supplementary Example 1 illustrates 
how the mass spectral data from a mass 
spectrometer data file can be browsed 
and printed. Also highlighted in 
Supplementary Example 1 are the benefits 
of ProteoWizard’s Common Language 
Infrastructure bindings, which allow 
the library to be accessed from diverse 
languages including C#, IronPython and 
Visual Basic. Supplementary Example 
2 illustrates how peptide and protein 
identification data can be browsed and 
printed. In Supplementary Example 3, 
we illustrate how the mzR library enables 
ProteoWizard-based data access within 
the R statistical analysis toolkit. Notably, 
mass spectrometry data can be used 
for a variety of applications other than 
proteomics investigation. The data layer 
does not impose any restrictions that inhibit 
its use for any mass-spectrometry-based 
problem. ProteoWizard is already used in 
metabolomics applications13 and should 
find utility in analysis of glycomics data.
Below the data layer is the ‘utility 
layer’ (Fig. 1a). The utility layer contains 
applications that perform computations, 
such as binary to text encoding, XML 
parsing and mathematical calculations 
that are common in data analysis. A list 
of available utility classes is provided in 
Supplementary Table 3. Although the 
majority of computations available in 
these classes are straightforward, their 
implementation can be time consuming. 
Using ProteoWizard, developers are able 
to focus on developing novel algorithms, 
rather than on redundant implementation 
of requisite parsing and data handling code, 
thus accelerating the development timeline.
The ‘analysis layer’ further builds upon 
the data layer and provides common 
proteomics-centric analysis modules. A 
major bottleneck in proteomics software 
development can arise from the time 
required to implement the vast array of 
standard operations routinely required of a 
proteomics algorithm, such as computing 
the mass of a peptide (Supplementary 
Field-standard open formats (e.g., mzML, 
mzXML, MGF, pepXML and mzIdentML) 
and vendor proprietary formats are 
handled with a plug-in reader interface 
(Fig. 1b). In partnership with proteomics 
standards bodies and instrument and 
software vendors, we have developed a 
series of adapters that translate between 
input files and the core msData data 
structures to support a wide range of 
formats (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). 
These adapters bridge vendor-provided 
libraries that read proprietary formats and 
the fully open ProteoWizard data layer. 
Through a series of generous licenses, the 
ProteoWizard Software Foundation (Los 
Angeles) has permission to distribute 
vendor-provided libraries from AB SCIEX, 
Agilent, Bruker, Thermo Fisher Scientific 
and Waters with the ProteoWizard Toolkit. 
Consequently, bioinformatics developers 
are not required to have direct access to an 
instrument to develop software that can 
analyze data generated by it.
Furthermore, any application built upon 
the ProteoWizard framework is largely 
format agnostic for the dominant formats 
in the field. By writing their software 
using ProteoWizard’s msData application 
programming interface (API), developers 
can focus on algorithmic challenges, rather 
than on the complex details of the wide 
array of formats prevalent throughout the 
field of proteomics. Furthermore, the use 
of the ProteoWizard API has the potential 
to improve the robustness and reliability 
Figure 1 Design of ProteoWizard. (a) ProteoWizard uses modern design principles to implement a 
modular framework of many independent libraries grouped in dependency levels with strict interfaces. 
This allows extensive development at each level while enforcing stability. (b) The data layer presents a 
unified access interface to mass spectrometry data. The modular framework allows additional readers 
for diverse file types to be easily added by means of plug-in adaptor classes. Developers only need 
interact with the primary interface to access data, agnostic to the details of an input source file.

Example 4) or performing an in silico
digest of a protein read from a FASTA file 
(Supplementary Example 5). There are 
also independent modules for handling 
chemical formulas, peptide calculations and 
isotope envelopes. All these computations 
are contained in reusable, platform￾independent modules in the analysis 
layer. A list of available analysis classes is 
provided in Supplementary Table 3.
Additional analysis modules are 
currently in development with an emphasis 
on establishing standard interfaces for 
common proteomics computations, such 
as peak picking, isotope deconvolution 
and precursor estimation14. Our goal is to 
work collaboratively to create a modular 
analysis infrastructure in which experts 
will be able to contribute a module that 
can then be plugged into various software 
tools. This will allow, for example, an 
expert in signal processing to contribute 
a peak picker without having to handle 
details of file formats, operating systems 
or command-line configurations. The 
ProteoWizard Toolkit also includes a 
number of small, useful applications, listed 
in Supplementary Table 4, that are built 
upon the libraries. These applications 
support data conversion (msConvert, 
msConvertGUI and idConvert), data 
visualization (msPicture and seeMS), 
data access (msAccess, msCat, idCat and 
msPicture), data analysis (peekaboo and 
msPrefix14) and basic proteomics utilities 
(chainsaw).
Beyond the ProteoWizard Toolkit, 
the ProteoWizard Software Foundation 
has built several projects on top of the 
ProteoWizard Toolkit that provide useful 
end-user applications. The most widely 
known example, Skyline15, is becoming 
the standard tool for targeted proteomics 
investigation. A second project, Topograph, 
is focused on measuring protein turnover 
in metabolic labeling time-course 
experiments. Other projects are underway. 
To be included in ProteoWizard, projects 
must demonstrate broad applicability 
within the field and active ownership within 
the contributing organization. They must 
also adopt nonrestrictive licensing1 and 
continue to develop new features in open￾source formats. Project contributors must 
provide thorough automated testing and 
participate in the ProteoWizard build and 
continuous integration processes.
The ProteoWizard Toolkit and Projects 
attempt to provide useful analytic tools 
to the proteomics community while 
simplifying the process of software 
development and bioinformatics for mass 
spectrometry and proteomics. Our hope 
is that a standardized toolkit will enable 
rigorous development and assessment 
of diverse computational approaches to 
rapidly accelerate proteomics research.

Assessing unintended 
hybridization-induced biological 
effects of oligonucleotides
To the Editor:
Oligonucleotide drugs come in various 
forms, lengths and modifications, 
archetypes being single-stranded antisense 
oligonucleotides (ASOs)1 or double￾stranded small interfering RNA (siRNAs)2. 
Similar to all drugs, oligonucleotide 
therapeutics carry the risk of causing 
unintended toxicities or side effects. The 
mechanisms of toxicity for oligonucleotides 
can be subdivided into hybridization￾independent and hybridization-dependent 
effects. Hybridization-independent 
toxicities are due to interactions between
