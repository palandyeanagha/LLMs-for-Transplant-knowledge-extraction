Abstract
Intratracheal transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuates the
hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. The aim of this study was to optimize the timing of MSCs transplantation. Newborn
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly exposed to hyperoxia (90% for 2 weeks and 60% for 1 week) or normoxia after birth for
21 days. Human UCB-derived MSCs (56105 cells) were delivered intratracheally early at postnatal day (P) 3 (HT3), late at P10
(HT10) or combined early+late at P3+10 (HT3+10). Hyperoxia-induced increase in mortality, TUNEL positive cells, ED1
positive alveolar macrophages, myeloperoxidase activity and collagen levels, retarded growth and reduced alveolarization
as evidenced by increased mean linear intercept and mean alveolar volume were significantly better attenuated in both HT3
and HT3+10 than in HT10. Hyperoxia-induced up-regulation of both cytosolic and membrane p47phox indicative of oxidative
stress, and increased inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL) -1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and transforming
growth factor-b measured by ELISA, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, CXCL7, RANTES, L-selectin and soluble
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 measured by protein array were consistently more attenuated in both HT3 and HT3+10
than in HT10. Hyperoxia-induced decrease in hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor was
significantly up-regulated in both HT3 and HT3+10, but not in HT10. In summary, intratracheal transplantation of human
UCB derived MSCs time-dependently attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats, showing significant
protection only in the early but not in the late phase of inflammation. There were no synergies with combined early+late
MSCs transplantation.

Introduction
Recent improvements in neonatal intensive care medicine have
resulted in marked improvements in the survival of the premature
infants [1]. However, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a
chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy
in the premature infants, still remains a major cause of mortality
and morbidity with few effective treatments [2,3].
Although the pathogenesis of BPD has not been clearly
elucidate yet, oxidative stress and the ensuing inflammation
mediated by neutrophils [4] and pro-inflammatory cytokines [5] is
believed to play a seminal role in the lung injury process leading to
the development of BPD [6]. Recently, we have shown that local
intratracheal but not systemic intraperitoneal xenotransplantation
of human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) attenuates hyperoxia induced lung injuries such as
impaired alveolarization, increased apoptosis and fibrosis in the
immunocompetent neonatal rats [7]. Furthermore, these protec￾tive effects of stem cell transplantation were dose dependent [8].
Overall, these findings suggest that human UCB derived MSCs
transplantation could be a novel therapeutic modality for BPD.
However, while the administration of human UCB-derived MSCs
at postnatal day (P) 5 was effective in our previous studies [7,8], the
optimal timing for their administration has not been determined
yet.
Previously, we have shown that the protective effects of human
UCB-derived MSCs transplantation are primarily mediated by
their anti-inflammatory effects rather than by their regenerative
capabilities [7,8]. These findings suggest that the therapeutic time

window of stem cell transplantation could be narrow, i.e., only
during the early but not the late phase of inflammatory responses.
In the present study, we thus tried to determine the optimal timing
at which intratracheally delivered human UCB-derived MSCs
could attenuate the hyperoxia-induced lung injuries in the
newborn rat pups. We firstly conducted time course experiments
of inflammatory responses by measuring inflammatory cytokines
such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1a, 1b and
6 levels at P 0, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 in the hyperoxia-induced
neonatal lung tissue. After then, we tried to determine the optimal
timing by comparing the therapeutic efficacy of early (P3) versus
late (P10) intratracheal administration of human UCB derived
MSCs in attenuating the hyperoxia-induced lung injuries in the
newborn rat pups. We also tried to determine whether combined
early (P3)+late (P10) stem cell transplantation has any synergistic
effects.
Materials and Methods
Cell Preparation
This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of
Samsung Medical Center and by Medipost, Co., Ltd, Seoul,
Korea. As previously reported, UCB was collected from umbilical
veins after neonatal delivery with informed consent from pregnant
mothers, and MSCs were isolated and cultivated from human
UCB [9,10]. The cells expressed CD105 (99.6%) and CD73
(96.3%), but not CD34 (0.1%), CD45 (0.2%) and CD14 (0.1%)
[7]. They were positive for HLA-AB (96.8%), but generally not for
HLA-DR (0.1%). The cells also expressed pluripotency markers
such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct 4; 30.5%) [11]
and stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA-4; 67.7%) [12].
Human UCB-derived MSCs differentiated into various cell types
such as respiratory epithelium, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and
adipocytes with specific in vitro induction stimuli [7,10,12,13]. We
confirmed the differentiation potential and karyotypic stability of
the human UCB-derived MSCs up to the 11th passage.
Animal model
The experimental protocols described herein were reviewed and
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Samsung
Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul, Korea. This study was also
performed in accordance with the institutional and National
Institutes of Health guidelines for laboratory animal care. Timed
pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Orient Co., Seoul, Korea) were
housed in individual cages with free access to water and laboratory
chow. The rat pups were delivered spontaneously and reared with
their dams. The experiment began within 10 h after birth, and
continued through P21. Rat pups were randomly divided into four
experimental groups; normoxia control group (NC), hyperoxia
control group (HC), hyperoxia with early at P3 (HT3), late at P10
(HT10), or combined early+late at P3+10 (HT3+10) human UCB￾derived MSCs transplantation group. Rat pups of NC were kept
with a nursing mother rat in the standard cage at room air
throughout the experiment. Rat pups of hyperoxia groups were
maintained with a nursing mother in the standard cage within a 50
liter Plexiglas chambers in which the hyperoxia (oxygen concen￾tration of 90%) was maintained until P14, and after then oxygen
concentration was reduced to 60% until P21. Humidity and
environmental temperature were maintained at 50% and 24uC,
respectively. Nursing mother rats were rotated daily between litters
in the normoxia and hyperxoxia groups to avoid oxygen toxicity.
Survival and body weight of rat pups in each group were checked
daily throughout the experiment. The rat pups of NC and HC
were sacrificed at P 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 for time course
experiments and at P21 for group comparison under deep
pentobarbital anesthesia (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and the
whole lung tissue was obtained for morphometric and biochemical
analyses. Six to eight animals were used in each subgroup of
analysis.
Transplantation of human UCB-derived MSCs
The human UCB-derived MSCs from the 5th passage from a
single donor were labeled using a PKH26GL Red Fluorescent Cell
Membrane Labeling Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for
transplantation according to the manufacturer’s protocol in the
present study, as previously reported [7,8]. For donor cell
transplantation, 56105 cells in 0.05 ml phosphate buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) were administered intratracheally at P 3, P 10 or P
3+10. For NC and HC, equal volume of PBS was given
intratracheally at P3 and P10. For intratracheal transplantation,
the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine and xylazine mixture (45 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, respec￾tively), and restricted on a board at a fixed angle. MSCs were
administered into the trachea through a 30-gauge needle syringe.
After the procedure, the animals were allowed to recover from
anesthesia, and were returned to their dams. There was no
mortality associated with the transplantation procedure.
Tissue preparation
The lungs were resected after transcardiac perfusion with ice￾cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 280uC for later biochemical analyses.
For morphometric analyses, lungs were fixed in situ by tracheal
instillation of 10% buffered formalin at a constant inflation
pressure of 20 cm H2O, and then fixed overnight at room
temperature in the same fixative. The fixed right lungs were
embedded in paraffin, and the left lungs were embedded in an
optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (SAKURA 4583,
Sakura, Torrance, CA, USA). Blocks of the OCT compound were
sectioned at 10 mm on a cryostat (Shandon Cryotome, Thermo
Electron Co., Waltham, MA, USA) and stored in a deep freezer
until analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Four-micrometer-thick
sections were cut from the paraffin blocks, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Images of each section were captured with
a magnifier digital camera through an Olympus BX40 microscope
(Olympus optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and were saved as
JPEG files.
Morphometry
The level of alveolarization was determined by measuring the
MLI and mean alveolar volume. The mean inter-alveolar distance
was measured as MLI, by dividing the total length of the lines
drawn across the lung section by the number of intercepts
encountered, as described by Thurlbeck [14]. The mean alveolar
volume was calculated using the method reported by Snyder et al.
[15,16]. Briefly, a grid containing equally spaced crosses was
placed on a uniformly enlarged photomicrograph of each lung
field. The diameters (,) of the alveoli containing a cross were
measured along the horizontal axis of the cross. The cube of the
alveolar diameter times p and divided by 3 (,3
p/3) was used to
estimate the mean alveolar volume. A minimum of two sections
per rat and six fields per each section were examined randomly for
each analysis.
TUNEL assay
The immunofluorescent TUNEL staining with an in situ cell
death detection kit (S7110 ApopTag, Chemicon, Temecula, CA,

USA) was done to measure the extent of apoptosis in the lung.
Paraffin section slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and
digested with Proteinase K (20 mg/ml in PBS) (Sigma Co., St.
Louis, MO, USA) at room temperature for 15 minutes and then
washed in PBS for 10 minutes. Sections were then incubated with
equilibration buffer for 1 minute and immediately incubated with
working strength TdT enzyme in a humidified chamber at 37uC
for 1 hour. Each section was immersed in a stop/wash buffer and
gently rinsed with PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
anti-digoxigenin conjugate was applied to the sections which were
then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark.
Nuclear counterstaining was performed with propidium iodide
(0.5 mg/ml, Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Slides were washed
again in PBS, mounted with Vectasheild mounting solution
(Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and visualized with a
fluorescent microscope (Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope,
Tokyo, Japan) using an excitation wavelength of 460–490 nM.
Ten non-overlapping fields with a magnifying power of6200 were
examined to count TUNEL positive cells.
Quantification of the PKH26 positive cells
Ten-mm-thick cryosections were mounted with a Vector shield
mounting solution containing DAPI (H-1200, Vector, Burlingame,
CA, USA). The cell counts for the transplanted or donor-derived
cells were measured using PKH26 red fluorescence, as described
above after combining the 620 objective images of the DAPI￾stained nuclei signals. Five fields per section were selected
randomly, focused, and counted with the naked eye under a
fluorescence microscope (Nikon E600, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) using
a filter to detect the PKH26 red fluorescence. The PKH26 red
fluorescence was counted manually and averaged per high power
field (HPF) in a single animal. Two random sections per animal
were evaluated in a blinded manner.
Western blot for p47phox
The upregulation of p47phox, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, both
in the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane portion serves as an
indicator of NADPH oxidase activation that is responsible for
generating reactive oxygen species [17,18]. Tissue slides were
incubated for 40 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After
blocking with 0.5% BSA, slides were incubated overnight at 4uC
with anti-p47phox antibody (1:200) and then exposed for 2 hr at
room temperature to FITC-conjugated goat anti mouse immuno￾globulin-G (1:200; BD Biosciences, USA). Vectasheld mount
medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) was used to preserve.
Confocal microscopic examination was carried out at 4006
magnification using Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 (Bio-Rad Laborato￾ries Inc. Hercules, CA, USA) with krypton/argon laser, and
images were achieved using the Laser shop 2000 software (Bio￾Rad Laboratories, Inc.). For this purpose, tissue sample from each
animal were separated into membrane and cytosolic components
for western blot examination. Tissues were homogenized in ice￾cold hypertonic solution and centrifuged at 600 g for 10 minutes.
The supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1.5 hours.
The supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction and the
membrane-particulate pellet was resuspended in hypotonic
solution containing 1% Triton X-100. Samples were analyzed
by western blotting using antibodies against the NADPH oxidase
cytosolic subunit, p47phox (1:500, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA,
USA). The bands were recognized by horseradish peroxidase￾conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000, DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark), and then western blots were developed with
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham
Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and exposed to X-ray film (Fuji
Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The blots were re-probed with
antibodies against GAPDH (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). To determine the relative degree of
membrane purification, the membrane fraction was subjected to
immunoblotting for calnexin (1:500 Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc), a membrane marker.
Protein macroarray
Each lung lysate was analyzed using a rat cytokine array kit
(Proteome ProfilerTM; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). A
total of 250 mg of lysate was incubated in the nitrocellulose
membrane array overnight at 4uC. After washing away the
unbound protein, the array was incubated with a cocktail of
phospho-site-specific biotinylated antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature, followed by streptavidin–HRP for 30 min. Signals
were visualized with chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham
Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and recorded on X-ray film.
The arrays were scanned, and optical densities were measured
using Image J software (NIH) and compared among the
experimental groups. The protein macroarray analysis included
inflammatory cytokines of interest, including tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7
(CXCL7), regulated upon activation normal T-expressed and
presumably secreted (RANTES), L-selectin and the soluble form
of intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1.
Myeloperoxidase activity
The activity of MPO, an indicator of neutrophil accumulation,
was determined by modification of the method by Gray et al. [19].
The lung tissues were homogenized in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
and centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min. The pellet was
resuspended in another phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0)
containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. MPO
activity in the resuspended pellet was assayed by measuring
absorbance changes spectrophotometrically at 460 nm, using
0.167 mg/mL of O-dianisidine ihydrochloride and 0.0005%
hydrogen peroxide. One unit of MPO activity was defined as
the quantity of enzyme degrading 1 mM of peroxide/min.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
Total RNA in the sample was extracted using RNA Trizol
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA concentration was measured by
spectrophotometry (Nanodrop Wilmington, DE, USA) at 260 nm.
One microgram of RNA was used to produce cDNA with a
ProtoscriptH II RT-PCR kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA). PCR primers for rat hepatocyte growth factor and rat
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were de￾signed with Primer3 (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA)
and synthesized by Bioneer Inc. (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The
sequence of primers used was as follows: rat HGF (sense￾accctggtgtttcacaagca- antisense-aggggtgtcagggtcaagag-), rat
GAPDH (sense- ggccaaaagggtcatcatct-, antisense-gtgatggcatg￾gactgtggt-). PCR products were run on a 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide and scanned by a
Gel Doc 2000 analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The
expression levels for each gene were semi-quantified by densito￾metric analysis using software (Quantity One, Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Relative expression levels were estimated by the
density ratio of rat GAPDH to rat HGF.

Statistical Analysis
The data are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Survival rates
were compared using the Kaplan-Meier analysis followed by a log
rank test. For continuous variables with a normal distribution, the
groups were compared using a t-test with a Bonferroni correction.
Continuous variables that were not normally distributed were
analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank test with a Bonferroni
correction. All data were analyzed using Stata software (ver.
11.0, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Values of p,0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Temporal profile of inflammatory responses
In time course experiments of inflammatory responses by
measuring TNF-a, IL-1a, IL-1b and IL-6 levels with ELISA at P
1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 in the lung tissue, IL-6 levels after P5 and
TNF-a, IL-1a and IL-1b levels after P7 in HC became
significantly increased compared to NC up to P 14 (Fig. 1).
Survival rate and body weight gain
Exposure to oxygen (HC) significantly reduced the survival rate
to 70.8% (P,0.05 vs. NC) at the end of experiment (P21)
compared to the 100% survival rate of NC. On the contrary,
survival rates of HT3 (91.7%, P.0.05 vs. NC) and HT3+10
(87.5%, P.0.05 vs. NC) were not different when it compared to
NC. However, survival rate of HT10 (75.0%, P,0.05 vs. NC) was
significantly lower than that of NC (Fig. 2).
Although birth weight was not significantly different between
the five experimental groups (7.060.13 g, 7.160.04 g,
7.160.04 g, and 7.160.03 in NC, HC, HT3, HT10 and
HT3+10, respectively), body weight at P21 in HC (34.364.6 g,
P,0.01) was significantly lower compared to NC (41.762.3 g),
and this retarded body weight gain observed in HC was
significantly improved in HT3 (39.564.7 g, P,0.01 vs. HC) and
HT3+10 (38.864.4 g, P,0.01 vs. HC), but not in HT10
(35.764.2 g, P.0.05 vs. HC, P,0.05 vs. HT3, P,0.05 vs.
HT3+10 ).
Lung histopathology
Fig. 3A presents typical photomicrographs showing the histo￾pathological differences observed by optical microscopy in each
experimental group at P 21. While uniform and small alveoli were
observed in NC, impaired alveolar growth, as evidenced by fewer
and larger alveoli, focal airspace enlargement and heterogeneous
alveolar size were observed in HC compared to NC. After MSCs
transplantation, the hyperoxia-induced impairments in alveolar
growth and morphological changes were attenuated, particularly
in both HT3 and HT3+10 compared to HT10.
In morphometric analyses, the MLI and mean alveolar volume,
indicating the size and volume of the alveoli respectively, were
significantly higher in HC (67.261.2 mm in MLI, P,0.001 vs.
NC; 19.461.26104 mm3 in mean alveolar volume, P,0.001 vs.
NC) than in NC (40.861.0 mm in MLI and 3.160.046104 mm3 in
mean alveolar volume). (Fig. 3B). After MSCs transplantation,
these hyperoxia-induced morphometric abnormalities were better
attenuated in HT3 (54.061.4 mm in MLI, P,0.001 vs. HC;
6.760.96104 mm3 in mean alveolar volume P,0.001 vs. HC) and
HT3+10 (55.360.8 mm vs. HC, P,0.001; 6.260.56104 mm3 in
mean alveolar volume P,0.001 vs. HC) compared to those in
HT10 (59.461.7 mm in MLI, P,0.001 vs. HC, P,0.01 vs. HT3, ,
P,0.05 vs. HT3+10 ; 10.461.06104 mm3 in mean alveolar
volume P,0.001 vs. HC, P,0.01 vs. HT3, P,0.01 vs. HT3+10)
(Fig. 3B).

The number of TUNEL positive cells in the lung of P21 rats per
high power field was significantly increased in HC (15.261.1,
P,0.001) compared to NC (1.160.2). This hyperoxia-induced
increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells was significantly
attenuated in both HT3 (7.660.8, P,0.001 vs. HC) and HT3+10
(6.660.3, P,0.001 vs. HC), but not in HT10 (17.460.6, P.0.05
vs. HC, P,0.001 vs. HT3, P,0.001 vs. HT3+10) (Fig. 4).
The deposition of PKH26 red fluorescence positive donor cells
was observed only in the MSCs transplantation groups, but not in
NC and HC (Fig. 5A). The number of donor cells identified per
lung field was significantly larger in HT10 (21.562.9, P,0.001 vs.
HT3) and HT3+10 (25.461.7, P,0.001 vs. HT3) than in HT3
(10.661.6). However, there were no significant differences in the
donor cells between HT10 and HT3+10 (Fig. 5B).
Cytosolic and membrane expressions of p47phox
Since NADPH oxidase produces oxygen free radicals in both
phagocytic [20] and nonphagocytic cells [21,22], hyperoxia￾induced production of ROS was evaluated by NADPH oxidase
activation, as evidenced by increased cytosolic and membrane
expression of a cytosolic subunit of NADPH oxidase p47phox. In
fluorescent microscopy, increased p47phox was observed in HC
compared to NC, indicating the activation of NADPH oxidase.
After MSCs transplantation, the hyperoxia-induced increase in
p47phox was attenuated, particularly in both HT3 and HT3+10
compared to HT10 (Fig. 6A). In western blot analyses, significantly
higher levels of p47phox were observed in HC both in the cytosolic
(P,0.01) and membrane (P,0.05) fractions than in NC. While the
hyperoxia-induced increase in the cytosolic expression of p47phox
was significantly attenuated in the MSCs transplantation groups
(P,0.05 vs. HC) the increase in the membrane fraction was
attenuated in both HT3 (P.0.05 vs. NC) and HT3+10 (P.0.05
vs. NC), but not in HT10 (P,0.05 vs. NC).
ELISA and Protein array of cytokines
In HC, significantly increased levels of TNF-a (P,0.001 vs.
NC), IL-1a (P,0.001 vs. NC), IL-1b (P,0.01 vs. NC), IL-6
(P,0.001 vs. NC) and TGF-b (P,0.01 vs. NC) measured by
ELISA and TIMP-1 (P,0.001 vs. NC), CXCL7 (P,0.001 vs.
NC), RANTES (P,0.001 vs. NC), L-selectin (P,0.001 vs. NC)
and sICAM-1 (P,0.05 vs. NC) measured by protein array were
observed compared to NC (Fig. 7). The hyperoxia-induced
increase in these cytokine levels was significantly attenuated in
both HT3 and HT3+10, but not in HT10, and the attenuation of
IL-1a and IL-6 was more profound in HT3 (IL-1a, P.0.05 vs.
NC, P,0.01 vs. HC; IL-6, P.0.05 vs. NC, P,0.001 vs. HC) and
HT3+10 (IL-1a, P.0.05 vs. NC, P,0.01 vs. HC; IL-6, P.0.05

ED1 positive cells, Myeloperoxidase activity and Collagen

The ED1 positive alveolar macrophages were significantly
higher in HC (13.661.8, P,0.001) than in NC (1.060.1). This
hyperoxia- induced increase in ED1 positive cells was significantly
attenuated with MSCs transplantation, and this attenuation was
more profound in HT3 (4.960.8, P,0.001 vs. HC) and HT3+10
(4.960.2, P,0.001 vs. HC) than in HT10 (7.961.1, P,0.01 vs.

The MPO activity in HC (8.260.5 U, P,0.001) was signifi￾cantly higher than in NC (1.560.2 U). The hyperoxia-induced
increase in MPO activity was significantly attenuated in both HT3
(6.060.2 U, P,0.001 vs. HC) and HT3+10 (6.060.3 U, P,0.001

The lung collagen levels at P21 were significantly higher in HC
(14965 mg/mg protein, P,0.001) than in NC (8165 mg/mg
protein). This hyperoxia-induced increase in the lung collagen
levels was significantly attenuated in both HT3 (12463 mg/mg

HGF and VEGF
The HGF in the rat lung measured by RT-PCR at P21 were
significantly lower in HC (P,0.05) than in NC. The hyperoxia￾induced decrease in lung HGF was significantly up-regulated in
both HT3 (P,0.05 vs. HC) and HT3+10 (P,0.01 vs. HC), but
not in HT10 (P.0.05 vs. HC, P,0.05 vs. HT3, P,0.01 vs.

Discussion
In the present study, prolonged exposure of newborn rat pups to
hyperoxia for 3 weeks increased mortality, retarded growth, and
developed lung injuries similar to those seen in the premature
human infants with BPD [23,24], exhibiting decreased alveolar￾ization as evidenced by increased MLI and alveolar volume [25],
and significantly increased TUNEL positive cells [26]. Previously,
we have shown that the neonatal hyperoxic lung injuries induced
by $90% oxygen for 2 weeks were significantly attenuated with
intratracheal human UCB-derived MSCs transplantation at P5
[7], and these beneficial effects were dose dependent [8]. In the
present study, hyperoxic exposure was extended to 3 weeks to
guarantee the comparable time span after MSCs transplantation
at P10, and the oxygen concentration during the third week was
reduced from 90% to 60% because of the concern about increased
mortality due to prolonged high oxygen exposure. Only MSCs
given at P3 but not at P10 showed protective effects against the
hyperoxia-induced lung injuries, and no synergistic effects were
observed with combined early+late at P3+10 MSCs transplanta￾tion in this study. Overall, these findings suggest that the
therapeutic efficacy of human UCB-derived MSCs transplantation
is time-dependent, showing protection only during the early but
not late phase of inflammation.
In time course experiments of the present study, lung
inflammatory cytokine levels such as TNF-a, IL-1a, IL-1b and
IL-6 in HC became significantly higher after P5,7 compared to
NC. Intratracheal MSCs given at P3 or P5, but not at P10
protected against neonatal hyperoxic lung injuries in our previous
[7,8] and present studies. These findings suggest that increased
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the ensuing full blown
host inflammatory milieu might be a strong inhibitor of MSCs
protection against neonatal hyperoxic lung injury, and thus the
therapeutic time window of stem cell transplantation in BPD
might be limited only to the early phase of inflammation.
In the present study, the number of PKH26 positive cells at P21,
indicative of donor cell localization in the lung tissue, was
significantly higher in HT10 and HT3+10 than in HT3. These
findings suggest that substantial donor cell losses occur early after
intratracheal MSCs transplantation [27]. However, significant
protective effects against neonatal hyperoxic lung injuries were
observed in both HT3 and HT3+10, but not in HT10. Similar
results of beneficial effects of MSCs despite low engraftment have
also been reported in other disease models such as acute renal
failure [28], and cardiac injury [29]. In our previous study [7,8],
we also observed only very few donor cells differentiate into type II
pneumocytes, Overall, these findings suggest that even a small
number of MSCs survived could mediate their therapeutic effects
against neonatal hyperoxic lung injuries primarily by secreting key
bioactive mediators rather than by direct tissue repair [30], and
early timing of MSCs transplantation is critical for their best
protective effects. Moreover, although donor cells rapidly faded
away after transplantation, the favorable effects of MSCs were
persistent up to P21. These findings suggest that the paracrine
effects initially induced by stem cells might play a pivotal role in
tissue repair, and are sustained later by the intact host tissue
protected by MSCs transplantation [31]. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that rejection might have occurred in our
study because transplant was performed in a xenograft model;
therefore, further studies are needed to clarify this.
Oxidative stress to the immature lung is a well-known risk factor
for the development of BPD [32]. NADPH oxidase is a multi￾component enzyme complex responsible for production of
superoxide anion (O2
2), which generates other reactive oxygen
species such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and
hypochlorous acid [20]. Upon its activation, the cytoplasmic
subunits p47phox, p67phox, p40phox and Rac translocate to membrane
bound cytochrome [33]. The membrane translocation of the
p47phox can thus be served as an in vivo indicator of NADPH
oxidase activation in the lung tissue. In our previous study [8], we
have observed the dose-dependent anti-oxidative effects of
intratracheal MSCs transplantation. In the present study,

increased expression of the p47phox protein was observed both in
the cytosolic and membrane fraction in HC. Although significant
attenuation of cytosolic expression of the p47phox was observed
after MSCs transplantation, a decrease in membrane translocation
of the p47phox was observed in both HT3 and HT3+10, but not in
HT10. These findings suggest that MSCs transplantation at the
early rather than late phase of inflammation will be the optimal
timing for their best anti-oxidative effects.
In our previous studies [7,8], we have shown that inflammatory
responses mediated by neutrophils [4] and proinflammatory
cytokines [5] play a pivotal role in the development of BPD [6],
and that the protective effects of MSCs therapy against hyperoxia￾induced lung injuries are mediated primarily by their anti￾inflammatory effects rather than by their regenerating capacity.
In the present study, hyperoxia-induced increase in ED1 positive
alveolar macrophages, lung myeloperoxidase activity and cyto￾kines such as IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a measured by ELISA,
other inflammatory markers such as TIMP-1, CXCL7, RANTES,
L-selectin and sICAM-1 measured by protein array were
consistently attenuated by MSCs administration at both early
(HT3) and combined early+ late (HT3+10), but not at the late
(HT10) phase of inflammation. These findings suggest a full-blown
host inflammatory micro-environment might hinder the anti￾inflammatory effects of the transplanted MSCs. Further studies
will be necessary to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of
endogenous inflammatory factors on transplanted stem cells
function.
In our previous studies [7,8], we have shown that the anti￾fibrotic effect of transplanted MSCs was associated and probably
mediated by their down-modulation of hyperoxia-induced pulmo￾nary inflammatory responses. Significant attenuation of hyperoxia￾induced increase in both fibrogenic cytokines such as TGF-b and
TIMP-1 [34] along with other inflammatory cytokines, and
collagen levels in both HT3 and HT3+10, but not in HT10
support the assumption that the early timing of MSCs transplan￾tation is critical for their best anti-inflammatory and the ensuing
anti-fibrotic effects.
In the present study, hyperoxia-induced decrease in growth
factors such as VEGF and HGF was significantly up-regulated in
both HT3 and HT3+10, but not in HT10 despite higher donor
cell localization in the lung tissue at P21 in HT10 than in HT3.
These findings suggest that the protective effects of MSCs
transplantation such as promotion of angiogenesis, anti-apoptotic
effects and reduced inflammation are strongly associated or

probably mediated by enhanced secretion of these growth factors
[35]. Moreover, as the full blown host inflammatory milieu might
hinder the secretion of these growth factors by MSCs [36] the
timing of MSCs transplantation early in the inflammation is
essential for enhanced expression of these growth factors. Further
studies will be necessary to clarify this.
In summary, intratracheal transplantation of human UCB
derived MSCs time-dependently attenuated hyperoxia-induced
lung pathology such as decreased alveolarization and increased

apoptotic cells, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and the
ensuing fibrosis, and up-regulated growth factors such as HGF and
VEGF, showing significant protection only in the early at P3 but
not in the late at P10 phase of inflammation. There were no
synergies with combined early+late MSCs transplantation. These
findings are expected to have important implications for future
clinical translation to determine the optimal timing of MSCs
transplantation for the currently untreatable neonatal hyperoxic
lung disease i.e., BPD in premature infants.
