Abstract
Background: Congestive hepatomegaly might be the first sign for pulmonary hypertension. Apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) value obtained with quantitative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is
affected by liver fibrosis and perfusion. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of DW-MRI in cooperation with
biochemical markers, ultrasonography (US) and echocardiography (TTE) in determining the degree of hepatic
congestion secondary to pulmonary hypertension (PHT).
Methods: 35 patients with PHT and 26 control subjects were included in the study. PHT was diagnosed if
pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was measured above 35 mmHg with TTE. Study group was classified into
mild and moderate PHT. DW-MRI was performed with b-factors of 0, 500 and 1000 sec/mm². Mean ADC, ADC-II
(Average of the ADC values of right lobe anterior and posterior segments), US, TTE and blood biochemical
parameters of both groups were compared.
Results: There exists a positive correlation between liver size and the diameters of vena cava inferior, right atrium,
right hepatic vein(RHV), mid-hepatic vein(MHV), left hepatic vein(LHV) (p < 0.01). There was a positive correlation
between PASP and RHV, MHV, LHV. The patients had lower ejection fractions (p < 0.01) and higher LDH (p < 0.01)
and ALP (p < 0.05) levels than the control group. The ADC values of the patients with moderate PASP were higher
than those with a mild PASP (p < 0.05). Mean ADC was higher in patients with moderate PHT compared to control
group (p = 0.009). There was a positive correlation between PASP and ADC values of right lobe posterior segment
of the liver (p < 0.05). The ADC-II and mean ADC values of the patients with moderate PASP were higher than
those of the control group (p < 0.01).
Conclusions: Congestion due to moderate PHT might be diagnosed with DW-MRI. As PASP increase; mean ADC
and ADC-II values increase.
Introduction
Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is a disease caused by
various etiologies which may lead to right heart failure
and death. Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary
vascular resistance increases due to the physiopathologi￾cal and histopathological changes (vasoconstriction, vas￾cular proliferation, in situ thrombosis and vascular
remodeling) observed in PHT [1,2]. Disease may result
in centrilobular necrosis due to chronic passive liver
congestion if left untreated and present with edema,
ascites, jaundice, elevated biochemical markers and even
death [1-4]. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography
(TTE) is a non-invasive test used for cardiac evaluation
to determine pulmonary arterial systolic pressure in the
presence of tricuspid failure (sensitivity 100%, specificity
96%) [5,6].
Enlarged liver in addition to dilatation of hepatic veins
and inferior vena cava (IVC), both of which may be
demonstrated with ultrasonography (US), may result
from hepatic congestion. However, these signs are
observed in advanced PHT cases and hepatomegaly plus * Correspondence: yukseldogan@hotmail.com

intra-abdominal free fluid may be noted with increased
severity [7,8]. Signs of liver congestion due to early PHT
might be important in clinical differential diagnosis of
hepatomegaly.
There are several publications indicating the efficacy
of quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
measurement with diffusion weighted magnetic reso￾nance imaging (DW-MRI) in proving liver fibrosis and
evaluating other space occupying lesions [9]. Diffusion
weighted imaging is an advanced application of MRI
used in evaluating the microscopic structure of tissues.
This imaging method relies on quantification of the dif￾fusion of water molecules inside tissues. Combined with
other methods, this imaging modality might be used in
evaluating parenchymal tissue that has no proven
abnormalities with routine imaging modalities [10].
In our prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the
diagnostic value of DW-MRI in cooperation with bio￾chemical markers, US and TTE in determining the
degree of hepatic congestion secondary to PHT.
Materials and Methods
The study was performed on 61 subjects, consisting of
39 (63.9%) females and 22 (36.1%) males with an age
range of 25 to 82, recruited between July 2008 and Feb￾ruary 2009. Mean age of the subjects was 53.51 ± 13.98.
Written informed consent was obtained from all sub￾jects in conformity with the requirements of local ethics
committee. Subjects were divided into two groups as
“study group” (n = 35) and “control group” (n = 26).
Study group was composed of patients diagnosed with
TTE confirmed secondary PHT with underlying diseases
such as rheumatic heart disease, chronic obstructive
lung disease and congenital heart disease in the etiology.
Patients with normal TTE findings were included in the
control group. Lack of right heart failure, another sys￾temic disorder or malignity, chronic liver disease and
hepatic vascular pathology, acute and chronic hepatic
diseases (viral, autoimmune markers, infectious, infiltra￾tive, TSH, FT4, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, indirect bilir￾ubin, LDH, total protein, albumin) as revealed by the
past medical history, physical examination and labora￾tory findings were the inclusion criteria of the study
applied for both groups. A diagnosis of PHT was estab￾lished according to pulmonary arterial systolic pressure
(PASP) > 35 mmHg recorded by TTE. Diagnosis of
PHT was based on from the European Society of Cardı￾ology and the European Respiratory Society Guidelines
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of PHT [11]. Patients
with PHT were grouped as mild PHT (35-50 mmHg)
and moderate PHT (51-70 mmHg) according to their
PASP. Patients with the diagnosis of secondary PHT
were included in the study. Twenty six patients had
mild PHT, whereas 9 had moderate PHT.
The physical examination and evaluation of the
patients was performed by a cardiologist and gastro￾enterologist independently. The history of the patients
were particularly assessed concerning orthopnea, parox￾ysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) and effort dyspnea.
During cardiac evaluation all minor and major criteria
of heart failure like jugular venous pressure (JVP), jugu￾lar-venous reflex (JVR), hepatomegaly, and pretibial
edema were evaluated. Patients with high JVP, positive
JVR, orthopneic and PND patients, patients with con￾gestive and right heart failure or patients under treat￾ment, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and finally
patients with critical PHT were excluded from the
study.
All patients had a full history taken for alcohol use,
medications and risk factors for viral hepatitis. Electro￾cardiography, chest X-ray, echocardiography, aspartat
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total
and indirect bilirubin, upper abdominal US and liver
DW-MRI were performed in all patients and control
group. All patients had afull history taken for alcohol
use, medications and risk factors for viral hepatitis.
Patients were excluded from the study, if they had
acute coronary syndromes, severe functional capacity
(NYHA-IV), a diagnosis of or a symptom suggesting
chronic liver disease, malignity, any contraindication for
MRI, inadequate echocardiographic evaluation, severe
PHT and patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Two-dimensional continous doppler, color doppler
recordings of patients via TTE (GE, Vivid S5, Norway)
with a 2.5 - 3.5 MHz phased-array transducer were pro￾vided by an experienced cardiologist, who had no infor￾mation about the patient’s medical history, liver
function test, US and MRI findings. TTE was used to
measure left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), diameters
of right ventricle (RV), right atrium (RA), left heart
chambers and tricuspid failure [12]. The diameter of RV
and mediolateral diameter of midcavitary RA were cal￾culated in apical four-chamber position, in the end. The
heart chambers with the following measurements (RA >
45 mm, LA > 40 mm, RV > 28 mm) were accepted as
enlarged [13]. Right ventricular systolic pressure was cal￾culated from tricuspid failure in apical four chamber
position, according to Bernoulli equation: RVSP
(mmHg) = 4x (V2
) + right atrial pressure) [1], (Table 1).
RA pressure was estimated according to the size of the
inferior vena cava and the changes in its size during
respiration (a value of 5 mm Hg was assigned to a small
vena cava collapsing 50% in diameter during quiet
inspiration, a value of 20 mm Hg was assigned to a very
dilated vena cava without respiratory variation in size,
and values of 10 to 15 mm Hg were assigned to inter￾mediate findings) [13].

Ultrasonography
Abdominal US evaluations of the patient and control
groups were performed in supine position subsequent
to 6 hours of fasting. GE Logic 9 device (GE Medical
Systems, Milwaukee, USA) with 3.5-5 mHz convex
probe was used for the evaluations with two accompa￾nying radiologists with expertise on abdominal radio￾logy. Craniocaudal (longitudinal length) measurements
of the liver were performed in the mid-clavicular axis.
Diameter of IVC was measured 1 cm above the mer￾ging point of hepatic veins, right hepatic vein (RHV),
left hepatic vein (LHV), and middle hepatic veins
(MHV) were measured from 1 cm to IVC, and portal
vein (PV) was measured at the level of hilus of the
liver. Liver parenchymal echogenicity was found to be
homogenous and normal in all subjects (study and con￾trol groups) and space occupying lesions were
neglected including cysts and hemangiomas that were
smaller than 1 cm.
MR Imaging
MR imaging was performed on a 1,5 T body scanner
(Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 33 mT/m
maximum gradient capability using an eight channel
phased-array body coil.
Before diffusion weighted imaging, breath hold, axial
3D gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence; (repetition
time [TR], 5.32 ms; echo time [TE], 2.58 ms); 2D gradi￾ent-echo T1 in-phase and out-of-phase (TR, 128 msec;
in-phase TE, 4.89 msec; out-of-phase TE, 2.38 msec),
axial respiratory-triggered, turbo spin-echo T2-weighted
sequence with fat saturation (TR, 1900 ms; TE, 76 ms),
coronal T2-weighted half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin￾echo (HASTE) (TR, 1100 ms; TE, 116 ms) sequences
and then diffusion weighted single-shot spin-echo echo￾planar sequence with, chemical shift selective fat-sup￾pression technique; TR/TE, 4900/93; matrix, 192 × 192;
slice numbers, 30; slice thickness = 6 mm; interslice gap,
35%; FOV, 45 cm; averages, 5; acquisition time, approxi￾mately 3 minutes, PAT factor, 2; PAT mode, parallel
imaging with modified sensitivity encoding (m SENSE)
was performed. DW-MRI was performed with b-factors
of 0, 500 and 1000 sec/mm².
Image interpretation
The DWI datasets were transferred to an independent
Workstation (Leonardo console, software version 2.0;
Siemens) for postprocessing, and the ADC maps were
reconstructed.
To measure ADC value two abdominal radiologists
established round regions of interest (ROI) on the right
lobe posterior (RLP) and anterior (RLA) and left lobe
medial (LLM) and lateral (LLL) segments in consensus.
The ROIs were between 2-4 cm2 in size. Care was taken
to exclude vessels and motion artifacts from the ROIs.
For each ADC value measurement, we applied three
ROIs measurements to each segment and accepted the
average.
Average of mean ADC values of the RLA and RLP
segments was calculated as ADC-II. Mean ADCs, US,
ECHO and blood biochemical parameters of both
groups were compared.
Statistical Analysis
NCSS 2007 & PAS 2008 Statistical Software (Utah,
USA) were used for statistical analysis. Complementary
statistical methods (mean, standard deviation) as well as
student t-test was used in the comparison of quantita￾tive data and parameters with normal distribution. Pear￾son correlation analysis was used to evaluate the
relationship between parameters. Results were evaluated
with a 95% confidence interval and p < 0.05 level of
significance.
Results
Etiological distribution of patients with PHT included
21 cases with rheumatic valve disease, 8 cases with left
heart failure and 6 cases with chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease. There was no difference between the
PHT and control groups in terms of distribution of age
and sex (p > 0.05).
Levels of LDH (232,60 ± 68,89 vs 182,11 ± 42,59; p =
0.002) and ALP (101,54 ± 45,18 vs 81,07 ± 21,90; p =
0.038) of the PHT group were higher than those of the
control group.
Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of the PHT and
control groups showed that mean PASP was lower in
patients with normal RA compared to those with
enlarged RA (p < 0.05). There was no difference in
mean PASP in terms of RV and left atrial (LA) dia￾meters (p > 0.05). EF was markedly lower in the study
group compared to the control group (55,31 ± 9,51 vs
60,34 ± 4,56; p < 0.009).
Ultrasonographic evaluation
Significant positive correlation and significant associa￾tion was determined between liver size and diameter of

IVC (43.1%), diameter of RA (38.3%), diameter of RHV
(41.8%), diameter of MHV (40.5%) and LHV (41.1%)
(Table 2).
There was no difference in terms of liver size, dia￾meters of VP, IVC, RHV, MHV and LHV between
patients with mild PHT and control group (p > 0.05).
Mean ADC was higher in patients with moderate PHT
compared to those with mild group (p = 0.025) (Table
3). Mean ADC and ADC-II were higer in patients with
moderate PHT compared to those with control group
(p < 0.01). Liver size was significantly greater among
patients with moderate PHT compared to the control
group (p = 0.008). There was no difference in terms of
the diameters of IVC, VP, RHV, MHV and LHV among
subjects with moderate PHT and the control group (p >
0.05) (Table 4).
ADC measurements with DW-MRI
Mean ADC (1.82 ± 0.16) was higher in patients with
moderate PHT compared to those with mild PHT (1.62
± 0.22) (p = 0.025) (Figure 1). While mean ADC and
ADC-II were higher in patients with moderate PHT com￾pared to the control group (p < 0.05) (Table 4), mean
ADC-II was not different in patients with mild PHT and
control group (p = 0.297). The DW-MR images of a
moderate PHT patient are shown in Figure 2.
Discussion
PHT may lead to chronic passive hepatic congestion and
ischemic hepatic dysfunction due to secondary right
ventricular dysfunction. Increased right heart chamber
pressures secondary to physiopathological changes, in
pulmonary arteries result in dilatation of IVC and hepa￾tic veins. Stasis in the hepatic sinusoids stem from ele￾vated hepatic vein pressure cause hepatocellular hypoxia
and necrosis. These hepatic changes may present

clinically as hepatomegaly, ascites, edema and subic￾terus. Serum bilirubin, transaminase, ALP and pro￾thrombin times may be increased as a result of hepatic
dysfunction [14-18]. In our patients we determined
increased indirect bilirubin, ALP and particularly LDH
due to ischemic effects of congestion. Increased AST,
LDH and indirect bilirubin often presents with cardiac
pathologies (30-50%) [19-21]. In the study of Lau et al.,
levels of ALP, ALT, bilirubin and GGT were signifi￾cantly increased in conformity with the level of tricuspid
failure [12]. Elevated levels of ALP, LDH and indirect
bilirubin are important findings supporting the impor￾tance of biochemical markers in demonstrating hepatic
congestion.
Sensitivity and specificity of PASP measurement with
Doppler echocardiography compared to right-heart
catheterization are 100% and 96%, respectively [5,6].
Several studies, including that of Jayant Nath et al.
have demonstrated that mortality rates increase in the
presence of dilatation and dysfunction of right heart
chambers [22-25]. We also determined significant
relationship between RV and RA size and PASP (p =
0.038, p = 0.040, respectively).
Although used commonly in clinical practice, the sen￾sitivity and specificity of US varies in different liver
pathologies (passive congestion, hepatitis, mass lesions,
fibrosis etc.). A positive correlation was determined
between liver size and diameters of IVC, RA, RHV,
MHV and LHV (Table 4); however, liver size was
enlarged compared to the control group only in subjects
with moderate PHT. Even though it was not statistically
significant, VP, IVC, RVH, MHV and LHV values of the
moderate PHT group were increased when compared
with mild PHT and control groups. This may be a con￾sequence of the relatively low number of the study
group. There was no difference between subjects with
mild PHT and control group in terms of liver size and
diameters of VP, IVC, RHV, MHV and LHV (p < 0.05).
This indicates that no morphological changes are deter￾mined with US in mild PHT, whereas in moderate PHT
the only change is increased liver size which is better
diagnosed in moderate-severe PHT.

Diffusion-weighted imaging is a new imaging modality
recently implemented to be used in abdominal diseases
including diffuse liver diseases. This modality takes
approximately 3 minutes in addition to a routine
abdominal MRI and is a non-invasive procedure, which
does not require contrast material injection. Its advan￾tages include application without breath holding, repeat￾ability and relative cheapness. This modality may also be
used in the follow up of patients by making quantitative
measurements on ADC map constituted from diffusion
images [26-29]. Diffusion includes movement behaviors
of molecules in microscopic random pattern and this
movement is measured from mean diffusion coefficient.
DW-MRI is sensitive to this movement that is measured
with ADC, and water diffusion is measured with ADC
[30]. ADC is often higher than anticipated in biological
tissues due to the fact that the term microscopic move￾ment includes molecular diffusion of the water and
microcirculation of blood in capillary network. In other
words, ADC is influenced by both diffusion and perfu￾sion. MRI diffusion measurements might be influenced
by several factors including perfusion, cellular structure
and permeability [31,32].
Accurate detection and characterization of focal and
diffuse hepatic lesions can be performed with MR ima￾ging. Various sequences, such as inversion recovery, gra￾dient echo, spin echo seqıences are highly sensitive for
the detection of lesions. Once detected, they can often
be accurately characterized as malignant or benign, cyst
or solid tumor, etc., based upon their appearance and
relative signal intensity on T1- and T2- weighted
sequences with the help of fat supression techniques
and intravenous contrast material administration. Dif￾fuse liver diseases like fatty infiltration, iron accumula￾tion or fibrosis may be detected with these sequences
[33]. However, because of the characteristics of gradual
development of the diseases and no obvious morpholo￾gical changes, conventional imaging which only illus￾trates anatomical configurations can not provide
valuable information for clinical diagnosis especially in
the initial phases. Neither the hoarse echo of ultrasound
nor minor signal alteration on T2 weighted imaging of
MRI could provide quantitative criteria. DW-MRI, how￾ever, can detect the changes of tissue structure at mole￾cular level. Quantitative DW-MRI ADC measurement, is
sensitive to detect hepatic diffuse lesions in the early
stage [34,35]. Several studies have shown that the ADC
of cirrhotic liver is lower than that of normal liver [36].
ADC measurements are potentially useful for the eva￾luation of fibrosis staging in the liver [37-39].
DW-MRI studies aimed at demonstrating liver dis￾eases have shown limited diffusion and decreased ADC
value particularly in hepatitis, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis
due to reduced intercellular water and fibrotic reactions
[26-28]. Reduction in DW-MRI accompanied with
reduction in ADC by the damage in diffuse parenchymal
liver disease [40] may indicate the possible benefit in
differential diagnosis of congestion. Contrary to the lit￾erature, however, we found increased intercellular water
and diffusion and thus increased ADC accompanying
passive stasis. Our study is the first study performed on
passive congestion and our results are compatible with
basic diffusion knowledge [30-32].
Clinically ultrasonography is used in the evaluation of
liver parenchyma and is capable of showing morphologi￾cal changes resulting from passive congestion particu￾larly in cases with PHT. In our study, changes in liver
parenchyma have been demonstrated in patients with
moderate PHT using DW-MRI. LDH (p = 0.002) and
ALP (p = 0.038) levels of patients with PHT were deter￾mined to increase compared with control patients.
Although LDH and ALP increase may be noted in sev￾eral liver pathologies other than hepatic congestion,
mean ADC is decreased rather than increased in fibrotic
liver parenchymal diseases [32,41]. The facts that mean
ADC was higher in patients with moderate PASP com￾pared to mild PASP and that mean ADC plus ADC-II
were elevated in patients with moderate PHT confirm
that the perfusion effect resulting from cardiac effect on
the liver may be demonstrated on DW-MRI. Several
previous studies have thus suggested that posterior right
liver lobe should be preferred over left liver lobe in
ADC measurements [42,43]. Therefore, our right lobe
ADC-II measurement was found to be higher than that
of the control group. This finding suggests that liver
congestion is primarily localized in RLA and RLP seg￾ments which may be shown with DW-MRI.
The therapeutic options for PHT have significantly
improved in the last few years. But the disease is still too
often diagnosed late in its course. In more than 80% of
patients the diagnosis is made and treatment started when
the condition is already in NYHA class III-IV with a very
poor prognosis. According to the EARLY study, beginning
treatment 3-6 months earlier can improve prognosis and
progression of the PHT [44]. Late diagnosis is first of all
due to the fact that it is asymptomatic in the early stages,
such symptoms as dyspnoea, peripheral edema or syncope
frequently occurring only when there are already signs of
heart failure. Secondly, there is as yet no method for the
early diagnosis of PHT. But echocardiography and cardiac
MRI are non-invasive modes that are important for
screening and follow-up. Among noninvasive methods
echocardiography shows the greatest diagnostic sensitivity
and specificity. However this method has been considered
in frequently symptomatic patients with clinical progres￾sion and poor prognosis of the disease [45,46].
In our study, the congestion related alterations in USG
and DW-MRI investigations were also evident among
Dogan et al. Cardiovascular Ultrasound 2010, 8:28

patients with PTH without symptom and clinically overt
heart failure. Identification of significant differences in
RLA and RLP in congested liver seems to be the superior￾ity of DW-MRI to USG in evaluation of cardiac conges￾tion. Additionally DW-MRI was shown in our study as a
different radiological method enabling detection of cardiac
congestion before the development of heart failure. The
efficacy of early treatment induction (such as diuretics) in
patients with PTH has been a well-known phenomenon as
demonstrated by past studies [44]. This may indicate that
the degree of liver congestion and treatment response
could be evaluated by DW-MRI as a non-invasive method
enabling differential diganosis of hepatomegaly and also
cardiac congestion dependent hepatomegaly as well as
ealier induction of treatment in PTH.
The limitations of the study: MR is not often available
and it is not that cheap. Moreover, these patients are
often orthopneic and it may be difficult to perform an
MR. However technological advances in the field may
overcome at least some of these problems by shortening
the examination duration.
Consequently, DW-MRI performed to diagnose hepa￾tic congestion secondary to moderate PHT is an easy￾to-use, non-invasive and repeatable test that gives quan￾titative results and may be used in conjunction with
routine MRI modalities. In addition, hepatic congestion
(with increased ADC) may be easily distinguished from
diffuse parenchymal liver diseases characterized with
reduced ADC values. Collectively, these data indicate
that further studies should be performed to clarify the
place of this modality in both cardiac and other conges￾tive liver pathologies.
