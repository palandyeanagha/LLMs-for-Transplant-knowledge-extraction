Background: Proton beam has an excellent depth dose distribution due to its unique
physical properties, and thus proton beam therapy (PBT) has been tried and showed
promising outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this phase II
study is to evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated PBT in HCC.
Methods: The eligibility criteria for this study were as follows: patients with HCC lesion(s)
who were failed after, were difficult to treat with, or refused to other local treatments;
tumor size and number of ≤7 and ≤2 cm, respectively, and HCC lesion(s) of ≥2 cm
from gastrointestinal organs; Child–Pugh score of ≤7; Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status ≤1; and age ≥18 years. The prescribed dose of PBT was
70 Gy equivalent in 10 fractions. The primary endpoint was 3-year local progression-free
survival (LPFS) rate.
Results: Forty-five patients were prospectively enrolled, and there were 35 men and
10 women with a median age of 63 years (range, 46–78 years). Thirty-seven patients
had recurrent and/or residual disease, and eight patients had treatment-naive disease.
All patients received the planned treatments without treatment interruption, and grade
≥3 acute toxicity did not occur. The median follow-up duration was 35.1 months (range,
11.2–56.3 months) and local progression occurred in two patients (8.7%). The 3-year
rates of LPFS and overall survival (OS) were 95.2% (95% confidence interval [CI],
89.1%−100%) and 86.4% (95% CI, 72.9–99.9%), respectively.
Conclusion: Hypofractionated PBT showed promising LPFS and OS, and further
studies are warranted to compare PBT with other local modalities.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients mostly have an underlying chronic liver disease resulting
from hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus infection, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, and so on. Intrahepatic disease progression is the main cause of death in nonmetastatic
HCC patients (1). Thus, effective local treatments in these patients are crucial. Various local
treatment options for HCC patients, such as surgical resection, liver transplantation, local
ablative treatments including thermal ablation and percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE), radioembolization, and so on, have been available (2–5), but many

Kim et al. Phase II Study of PBT for HCC
factors including tumor burdens, tumor characteristics,
underlying liver function, and patient comorbidities limit the
treatment options.
With recent technological advances in radiotherapy (RT)
and biologic understanding of liver tolerance to RT, modern
sophisticated RT techniques, such as three-dimensional
conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, and stereotactic body
RT (SBRT), have made it possible to deliver high doses of
radiation to tumor(s) and reduce radiation doses to surrounding
noncancerous tissues including the remaining normal liver and
gastrointestinal (GI) organs, and these have shown promising
outcomes in HCC patients with/without tumor vascular
thrombosis (TVT) (6–9). Compared with RT with X-ray, proton
beam therapy (PBT), due to the inherent physical properties of
the proton beam (called Bragg peaks), has an excellent depth
dose distribution, which can increase the dose to the tumor while
maintaining the radiation dose in the noncancerous portion of
the liver (10–12). Recently, PBT with various fractionations (i.e.,
4–34 fractions) has been attempted and showed encouraging
outcomes (13–24). Theoretically, hypofractionated RT can
potentially improve the therapeutic ratio compared with
conventional fractionated RT by reducing the cancer cell
proliferation within the tolerances of surrounding noncancerous
tissues and shortening the overall treatment time. Based on this
rationale, this single-institutional, single-arm, prospective study
was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated PBT
for HCC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial. The
eligibility criteria for this study were as follows: (i) HCC was
diagnosed with pathological confirmation or radiologic findings
and serum α-fetoprotein concentrations of ≥200 ng/mL based on
the guidelines of the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group and the
National Cancer Center (NCC) (3); (ii) patients with primary
or recurrent HCC lesions who were failed after, were difficult
to treat with, or refused to other local treatments including
surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), TACE, and
so on; (iii) the largest diameter and number of target lesion(s)
were ≤7 and ≤2 cm, respectively, and targeted lesion(s) were
≥2 cm from GI organs; (iv) no history of prior RT to targeted
lesion(s); (v) no evidence of extrahepatic metastasis; (vi) Child–
Pugh score of ≤7 without uncontrolled ascites; (vii) Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤1; (viii) age
of ≥18 years; and (ix) adequate bone marrow (white blood cell
count 1,500/mm3
, platelet count 30,000/mm3
, and hemoglobin
7.5 g/dL) and liver (total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL, and aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase <5.0 × upper
limit of normal) functions. Clinical and tumor stage was classified
by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) (5) and the
Modified Union for International Cancer Control (mUICC)
(25) staging classification, respectively. This study was approved
by the institutional review board of NCC (NCC20150042) and
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02395523). Written
informed consent was obtained for all patients before enrollment.
Treatment
The simulation, plan, and treatment procedures of PBT have
been previously reported (11, 13–15, 17, 18). Briefly, a four￾dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast
was performed in all patients under monitoring the respiration
signals by a real-time position management (RPM) system
(Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and all obtained
CT images were resorted into 10 equally spaced respiratory
phases. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated in the
average intensity projection CT images, reconstructed with the
CT images of gated (exhalation) phases (30% of total respiratory
cycle). The internal target volume (ITV) was determined as the
sum of the GTVs without margin from GTV for clinical target
volume (11, 13–15, 17, 18, 21, 26), and the contours of the organs
at risk (OARs) were delineated in each CT image during the
gated phases. The planning target volumes (PTVs) included the
ITV plus a margin of 5–7 mm in all directions. Typically, PBT
plans (version 8.1; Varian Medical Systems) were performed with
two to four (median of three) 230-MeV proton beams (Proteus
235; Ion Beam Applications, S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium)
using the double-scattering mode to design so that 100% of
each prescribed dose would cover at least 95% of the PTV.
The delivered irradiated doses of PBT to target and OARs were
described in gray equivalents [GyE = physical dose of proton
(in gray) × relative biologic effectiveness of proton (1.1)] and
the equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions [EQD2 (GyE10 or GyE3)
= total dose× ({fraction dose+ α/β}/{2+α/β}), α/β of 3 and 10
for the late and acute effects, respectively] (27). The prescribed
dose to PTV was 70 GyE (EQD2, 99.2 GyE10) in 10 fractions
considering dose-fractionation regimens of our studies [50–72
GyE in 10–24 fractions (EQD2, 52.1–91.3 GyE10)] (13–18) and
those of other studies [24–91 GyE in 6–30 fractions (EQD2, 28–
103.5 GyE10)] (19–23). The dose volume constraints to the OARs
were described in detail in our previous reports (11, 13–18, 28).
The relative volumes of the remaining normal liver (total liver—
GTV) and total liver receiving more than 27 GyE were limited to
<50 and 60%, respectively, and the absolute volumes of the bowel
and stomach receiving more than 35 and 37 GyE, respectively,
were limited to <2 cm3
. At each treatment, all patients were asked
to fast for at least 4 h before treatment to diminish intrafractional
and interfractional uncertainties. Each patient’s position and
isocenter were verified using digital orthogonal fluoroscopy, and
radiation was delivered during the gated (exhalation) phases
under monitoring the respiration signals by RPM system.
Evaluation and Statistical Considerations
During PBT, patients were assessed weekly and, after completion
of PBT, at the first month, every 3 months for the first 2 years,
every 6 months up to 5 years, and yearly thereafter. Clinical,
laboratory, and radiological examinations were performed at
each follow-up. The tumor responses were assessed according
to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
criteria (29) by comparing pre- and post-PBT CT/MRI scans,
and the severity of adverse effects was graded using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).
The primary endpoint of this study was local progression￾free survival (LPFS), and we set the expected 3-year LPFS in

patients treated with PBT at 80% or higher, considering results
of our previous and other studies (17, 19, 22, 23, 30), with a
threshold of 15%. With a power of 80%, a type I error level of
10% and a follow-up loss rate of 10%, 45 patients were required
for enrollment. The definition of local, intrahepatic, and distant
progression was a regrowth or new tumor within the PTV, within
liver outside of the PTV, and extrahepatic sites, respectively.
The times of LPFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
survival (OS) were determined from the commencement date
of PBT to the date of local progression, disease progression or
death, and death or last follow-up, respectively. Survival was
estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the difference
in the survival curve was evaluated with the log-rank test in
univariate analysis. Statistical significance was set to a p < 0.05,
and all statistical tests were performed using STATA software
(version 14.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
Between March 2015 and September 2018, 137 patients were
assessed the eligibility for this trial. Of these, 50 patients
participated in other competitive trials, 42 patients did not agree
to inform consent, and the remaining 45 patients were enrolled
and analyzed (Figure 1). Patient characteristics at the time of PBT
are summarized in Table 1. Most (n = 37, 82.2%) patients, except
eight patients (17.8%) who were treatment-naive due to difficult￾to-treat lesions or refused to undergo other local treatments,
had recurrent and/or residual tumor(s) in the PBT site, and the
number of lesions treated with PBT was one and two in 42 and
three patients, respectively. The median time of follow-up was
35.1 months (range, 11.2–56.3 months).
Of 45 patients, all treated lesions eventually reached complete
response (CR), and the median time to CR was 5.1 months
[95% confidence interval (CI), 4.3–6.3 months] (range, 1–19.6
months) (Figure 2). With increasing tumor size [2 cm (n = 28),
2.1–4 cm (n = 14), and >4 cm (n = 3)], the median times to
CR increased [4.6 months (95% CI, 4.2–6.2 months), 6.4 months
(95% CI, 4.0–9.7 months), and 5.1 months (95% CI, 5.1–10.6
months), respectively], but these differences were not significant
(p = 0.675). At the time of analysis, 41 patients were alive,
and four died of disease progression. Of 45 patients, disease
progression occurred in 23 patients (51.1%) as follows: the initial
sites of disease progression were local sites in two patients (8.7%),
intrahepatic sites in 17 patients (73.9%), and distant sites in
four patients (17.4%), and all of the sites of disease progression
at the time of analysis were local sites in two patients (8.7%),
intrahepatic sites in 19 patients (82.6%), and distant sites in
eight patients (34.8%) (Figure 3). The median times to local,
intrahepatic, and distant disease progression were 12.5 months
(range, 10.5–14.4 months), 15.4 months (range, 2–30.1 months),
and 20.6 months (range, 1.5–22.5 months), respectively. After
disease progression was confirmed, 22 of 23 patients (95.7%),
except for one patient due to poor performance status, were
treated with salvage treatments, such as one or combinations of
local and/or systemic treatments (i.e., surgical resection, RFA,
TACE, PBT, RT, sorafenib, etc.).
The 3-year rates of LPFS, PFS, and OS were 95.2% (95% CI,
89.1%−100%), 45.2% (95% CI, 29.9%−60.5%), and 86.4% (95%
CI, 72.9%−99.9%), respectively (Figure 4). All pretreatment
characteristics were not significantly related to LPFS in the
univariate analysis (Table 2). Patients with recurrent lesion(s),
previous history of treatment to PBT site(s) or other site(s), and
mUICC stage II/III had a trend toward lower PFS than those
with primary lesion(s), no history of treatment to PBT site(s)
or other site(s), and mUICC stage I, but these differences were
not statistically significant in the univariate analysis because of
the small number of study populations (n = 45) (p > 0.05
each) (Table 2). The patients with HBV had significantly higher
PFS than the others in the univariate analysis (p < 0.05 each)
(Table 2). All pretreatment characteristics were not significantly
related to OS in the univariate analysis (p > 0.05 each).

of 45 patients, grades 1 and 2 elevated alanine aminotransferase
without evidence of disease progression developed in 3 (6.7%)
and 0 patients (0%), respectively, and the Child–Pugh score
showed a 1-point decrease in two patients (4.4%) and no change

DISCUSSION
Curative treatments, such as surgical resection, liver
transplantation, and local ablative treatments, including
RFA, offering a 5-year OS rate of 50–70% (2–5, 31), have been
applied for selected BCLC 0/A HCC patients. For BCLC B HCC
patients who have inoperable large or multifocal tumors not
suitable for curative treatments, TACE is recommended as a first
treatment with an expected median survival time of >30 months
and a 3-year OS rate of 40.4% (3–5, 31, 32). In our institutional
cohort data (31), 3-year OS rates in mUICC I/II patients with
Child–Pugh class A initially treated with surgical resection, liver
transplantation, and RFA were 83, 94.5, and 100%, respectively,
and 3-year OS rates in mUICC III patients with Child–Pugh
class A treated with surgical resection, liver transplantation,
and TACE were 56, 66.7, and 40.3%, respectively. In the present
study, PBT was applied to HCC patients who were failed after,
were difficult to treat with, or refused to other local treatments,
such as surgical resection, RFA, and TACE, and resulted in
3-year OS rates of 86.4, 85.9, 100, 100, and 80.6% in all BCLC
A, BCLC B, mUICC I, and mUICC II/III patients, respectively.
Similarly, Fukuda et al. (20) reported that the 5-year OS rates in
treatment-naive BCLC 0/A and B patients treated with PBT were

69 and 66%, respectively. Although direct comparisons among
the studies are difficult because of different tumor burdens,
patient characteristics, and selection bias, these results of PBT
in BCLC A/B patients were comparable to those of surgical
resection, RFA, and TACE. Although there is no randomized
study of PBT comparing with other local treatments, these
findings suggested that PBT could be considered as one of the
treatment modalities for these patients.
Treatments for HCC depend on various factors including
tumor factors (i.e., stage, location, size, number, and echogenicity

of tumor), remaining liver function, availability of transplant
donors, and patient comorbidities. Thus, as an alternative to
conventional treatments including surgical resection, RFA, and
TACE, RT including SBRT has been tried for HCC patients
who have failed after, are difficult to treat with, or refuse to
conventional treatment modalities (3, 6–8, 21, 33, 34). A recent
pooled analysis of SBRT using 24–60 Gy in three to six fractions
(EQD2, 48–114.8 Gy10; median, 83.3 Gy10) has shown a 3-year
LPFS of 83.9% and a 3-year OS of 48.3% (7). Wahl et al. (8)
analyzed patients receiving SBRT (n = 63) and RFA (n = 161) and

Kim et al. Phase II Study of PBT for HCC
reported that the 2-year LPFS and OS rates were not significantly
different (83.8 vs. 80.2%, p > 0.05; and 46.3 vs. 52.9%, p >
0.05, respectively), but a recent analysis of the National Cancer
Database data for treatment with SBRT (n = 296) and RFA (n
= 3,684) showed that 5-year OS was superior in RFA compared
with SBRT (29.5 vs. 19.3%, p < 0.01) (6). Proton beam therapy
using 24–84 GyE in 4–34 fractions (EQD2, 28–103.5 GyE10) has
also been tried for patients with inoperable or recurrent HCC and
has shown promising 2- or 3-year LPFS rates of 75–96% and 2-
or 3-year OS rates of 45.1–66% (13–24). Because results from a
randomized study comparing PBT with SBRT are not available
to date, whether PBT is truly equivalent or superior to SBRT
or conventional treatment modalities for tumor control remains
unanswered. However, our and others’ dosimetric studies of PBT
compared to RT with X-rays showed that PBT can reduce the
irradiated liver volume at low to intermediate dose levels and
subsequently may potentially decrease the risk of liver toxicity
by allowing dose escalation for tumors (10–12). Meta-analysis
showed a lower incidence of toxicity in PBT compared to RT
with X-ray, with no significant difference in LPFS and OS (35),
and Sanford et al. (36) showed PBT was superior to RT with X￾ray for OS by less liver toxicity. A recent systematic quantitative
review of 13 SBRT studies for the HCC patients by Ohri et al.
(34) did not show improvement of local tumor control by dose
escalation. In a recent analysis of the National Cancer Database
for T1–2N0 HCC patients treated with PBT (n = 71) or SBRT
(n = 918), PBT and EQD2 of >83 GyE10 improved survival
compared with SBRT and EQD2 of <83 GyE10, respectively (33).
Our phase I dose-escalation study (17) showed that at least 78
GyE10 would be needed for local tumor control, and our previous
studies of HCC patients with TVT (n = 41) and with/without
TVT (n = 243) receiving risk-adapted PBT with 50–66 GyE in
10 fractions (13, 15) consistently showed that LPFS was superior
at EQD2 of ≥80 GyE10 compared with EQD2 of <80 GyE10.
Although direct comparisons among the studies were difficult
because of the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, different
tumor loads, comorbidities, and selection bias, the EQD2 used in
the present study (70 GyE in 10 fractions; EQD2, 99.2 GyE10) was
at the high end of the range in the previous studies (EQD2, 28–
103.5 GyE10) and yielded the high end of LPFS and OS without
grade ≥3 toxicity (17, 19, 22, 23, 30). These findings implied that
dose escalation with PBT may improve local tumor control and
survival by minimizing the risk of toxicity.
The present study included patients who had a tumor size and
number of ≤7 cm and ≤2, respectively, and/or 2 cm away from
GI organs and Child–Pugh class A. Thus, further prospective
and large-scale studies considering patients with large (>7 cm),
multiple (≥3) tumors and/or close to GI organs and Child–Pugh
class B/C are needed to define the role of PBT in HCC patients.
Based on promising outcomes of PBT in present and previous
studies (13–15), we conducted a prospective cohort study of HCC
patients receiving PBT (NCC20180197) to comprehensively
evaluate the role of PBT in HCC patients. Because of the lack
of a randomized trial comparing PBT with current established
treatments, surgical resection, RFA, TACE, and so on, it is
still unclear to date whether PBT can truly achieve outcomes
comparable to those treatments. However, Bush et al. (24), in
preliminary results of a phase III trial comparing PBT with
TACE, showed a trend toward superior local tumor control and
lower toxicity for PBT compared with TACE. We conducted a
phase III study comparing PBT with RFA for HCC patients with
recurrent or residual disease (NCT01963429), and enrollment
was completed and awaiting data maturation.
In conclusion, this study showed that PBT could achieve
promising LPFS and OS similar to those of curative treatments
in BCLC A/B HCC patients with Child–Pugh class A in
our institutional cohort (31) and other studies (2–5, 31, 32),
with minimal toxicity. Although further prospective large-scale
studies of PBT for patients with unfavorable tumors (i.e., large
and multiple tumors and close to GI organs) and poor liver
function (i.e., Child–Pugh class B and C) are needed, our data
suggest that PBT could be considered as one of the therapeutic
options in HCC patients depending on the tumor burden and
patient morbidities.
