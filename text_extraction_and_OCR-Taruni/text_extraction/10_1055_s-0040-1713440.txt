History
The classic tale of Gaspare Aselli’s vivisection of a well-fed dog
to discover lacteals is often repeated, yet lymphatic history
stretches back further. The first recorded discovery of a
lymphatic structure was the lymph node in the 5th century
BCE by Hippocrates. He found many nodes scattered around
the body, calling thefluid contained within “ichor.”Aristotle, in
the 4th century BCE, described colorless humors called
“sanies,” potentially being the first description of lymph
vasculature. For the next two millennia, many individuals
would discover various components and functions of the
lymphatic system; Galen (3rd century BCE) with lacteals and
the thymus, Paul of Aegina (7th century CE) with infected
lymph nodes, Nicola Massa (16th century CE) with renal
lymphatic vessels, and Bartolomeo Eustachi (16th century
CE) with the thoracic duct. However, it was not until the
17th century physician Gaspare Aselli’s well-documented
discovery of “venae albae aut lacteae” that the lymphatic
system was formally recognized.1
Aselli, while credited with discovering gut lacteals, mis￾characterized the overall flow of lymph, stating it to be from
the pancreas, to the liver, and then to the blood. This was
corrected several decades later by Jean Pecquet in 1651, who
also discovered the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct, and first
described the valvular nature of lymphatic vessels. Just
2 years later in 1653, Thomas Bartholin discovered systemic
lymphatic vessels outside the gut and liver, thus differenti￾ating systemic lymphatic fluid from mesenteric lymphatic
fluid and ultimately naming this fluid “lymph.”
Overview of Anatomy and Physiology
The lymphatic system functions as a diffuse network of
vasculature that exchanges, transports, and reabsorbs a
wide variety of molecules and cells. While the circulatory
system utilizes the heart to provide a central motor force, the
lymphatic system is propelled by a combination of peripheral
osmotic and oncotic forces, smooth muscle within vessel
walls, and decentralized muscle contractions throughout the

Abstract Lymphatics have long been overshadowed by the remainder of the circulatory system.
Historically, lymphatics were difficult to study because of their small and indistinct
vessels, colorless fluid contents, and limited effective interventions. However, the past
several decades have brought increased funding, advanced imaging technologies, and
novel interventional techniques to the field. Understanding the history of lymphatic
anatomy and physiology is vital to further realize the role lymphatics play in most major
disease pathologies and innovate interventional solutions for them.

body. Breslin et al aptly described the analogy best: “[while
arteries and] veins [function] like a super highway, lym￾phatics are slow local roads eventually leading to the heart.”

The lymphatic system can be thought of as numerous
independent compartments that progressively coalesce to emp￾tyinto the venous circulation. Each compartment serves distinct
functions and contains lymph of varying compositions. While
the lymphatic system includes lymphoid organs such as the
thymus and the spleen, the scope of this article will belimited to
the three major lymphatic compartments: soft-tissue/periph￾eral lymphatics, intestinal lymphatics, and hepatic lymphatics.
Lymph produced from these compartments coalesce into
the cisterna chyli, then giving rise to the thoracic duct which
ultimately returns fluid to the venous circulation at the junc￾tion of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins (►Fig. 1).
While this is the classical depiction, numerous smaller lym￾phovenous connections and anatomical variants exist.
The soft-tissue or peripheral lymphatics are distributed
throughout much of the soft tissue across the body and serve
numerous physiological purposes, with fluid homeostasis and
immunological surveillance being the most well-studied. These
functions are standard for all other lymphatic compartments as
well.
The intestinal lymphatics include much of the lymphatic
vessels draining the small and large intestines (also termed
“lacteals”) and include the intestinal Peyer’s patches. In
addition to the classic lymphatic functions, the intestinal
lymphatics absorb dietary fats from the intestines and
deliver this fat into circulation.
The hepatic lymphatics have historically been difficult to
image due to their small caliber, but recent advances in
imaging modalities have assisted greatly. Lymph flowing
from the liver has the additional function of delivering
hepatic proteins synthesized in the liver to the systemic
circulation.
Microarchitecture and Microphysiology
Lymphaticflow begins at the arteriovenous-capillary junction.
A diminishing, but net positive filtration pressure is present at
this junction with an estimated 8 to 12 L of fluid extravasated
into the surrounding interstitium daily.2–4 The lymphatic
systemis responsible for the majority offluid resorptive efforts
in the body. Small, blind-ended,lymphatic vesselsin surround￾ing tissue termed “initial lymphatic vessels” or “lymphatic
capillaries” reabsorb this lost fluid. These initial lymphatic
vessels are microscopically arranged in a leaf-like orientation,
which function as a one-way valvular structure. They are
formed by a single layer of endothelial cells organized on a
discontinuous basement membrane5,6 (►Fig. 2). Once this
fluid has entered the lymphatic system, it is termed “lymph.”
The composition of this early lymph differs widely across
the body and is determined by the organ or tissue from which
drainage occurs. This initial composition of lymph is typical￾ly like that of plasma, consisting primarily of water alongside
nutrients, plasma proteins, antigens, humoral factors, and
many other components.6 Lymph derived specifically from
the intestines and liver is termed “chyle” and contains a
higher concentration of proteins and chylomicrons—be￾tween 0.02 and 0.06 g/mL of proteins, and > 0.01 g/mL of
chylomicrons.7 This gives chyle a more opaque and milky
white appearance as opposed to lymph, which appears clear
or lightly translucent.
As lymph flows proximally toward lymph nodes and
beyond, initial lymphatic vessels transition into precollect￾ing and then collecting lymphatic vessels. These vessels are
lined by lymphatic smooth muscle cells and have continuous
tight junctions between vessel cells, limiting flow across the
vessel wall.8 Within the collecting lymphatic vessel are
proper intraluminal bicuspid valves formed from endothelial
cells and elastin, termed “secondary lymphatic valves,”
which limit retrograde lymph flow.2 The length of lymphatic
vessel between two valves is termed a “lymphangion” and is
the functional unit of the lymphatic system.6
Lymph flows proximally by both active and passive mech￾anisms. Lymphatic smooth muscle cells actively contract in a
systematic fashion, while neighboring arterial contractions,
smooth and skeletal muscle contractions, and pressure gra￾dients passively assist.9–11 Lymphangions can contract both
independently or synchronously with neighboring lymphan￾gions and are thought to be coordinated by local feedback
nervous tissue rather than central nervous system control,
given the decentralized nature and speed of coordination.12
Fig. 1 Overview of lymphatic flow in the body. The lower extremities, left
upper extremity, left head, left hemithorax, and subdiaphragmatic organs
drain into the cisterna chyli and transit through the thoracic duct emptying
into the left venous angle, near the junction of the left internal jugular and
subclavian veins. The right upper extremity, head, and hemithorax (drain￾age pattern shaded yellow) drain to the right lymphatic duct, near the
junction between the right internal jugular and subclavian veins.

As smaller caliber lymphatic vessels (both initial lymphatic
vessels and collecting lymphatic vessels) progressively con￾verge into larger vessels, each will flow into lymph nodes.
Lymph nodes generally receive multiple afferent vessels andfill
several roles, the most studied being immunologic function.
The node itself houses lymphocytes (primarily dendritic cells
and memory T-cells) to serve as immunologic first responders
against infectious and malignant agents. Many cancers spread
through the lymphatics, and these drainage pathways are the
foundational principles for sentinel node biopsy research.
Lymph nodes also concentrate lymph. Each node has a
dedicated artery and vein which allows excess water to be
osmotically reabsorbed. This leads to increased postnodal
lymphatic oncotic pressure, as approximately 4 L of fluid is
reabsorbed at the lymph node level.12 This aids in overall
fluid homeostasis and helps generate some of the driving
force for proximal lymph flow.
Cisterna Chyli and Thoracic Duct
Most lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes below the diaphragm
coalesce and drain into a central lymphatic sac located at the
T12–L2 level termed the “cisterna chyli” (►Fig. 3).13 The
cisterna chyliis usually 1 to 2 cmlong, with an average diameter
of 6.7 mm (►Fig. 4).13 Given the considerable anatomic vari￾ability of the lymphatic system, the cisterna chyli is not always
distinctively present, with one study reporting it in only 52% of
cases.13 The cisterna chyli serves as a valuable landmark for the
lymphatic system and typically receives lymph from the right
and left lumbar trunks, the intestinal trunk, and some of the
lower intercostal vessels (►Fig. 2). The lumbar trunks receive
lymph from the pelvis, kidneys, adrenals, and most of the
abdominal wall. The intestinal trunks receive lymph from the
gastrointestinal system and will also receive lipid-rich chyle.13
After collecting in the cisterna chyli, lymph flows proxi￾mally through the thoracic duct, and ultimately empties in
the venous circulation at the junction of the left internal
jugular and subclavian veins. Like much of the lymphatics,
there are many anatomical variants for both the course and
the ultimate destination of the thoracic duct. As the largest
lymphatic vessel in the body, the thoracic duct is the major
lymphatic-venous connection, returning much of the lymph
into the systemic circulation.
The thoracic duct begins at the superior aspect of the
cisterna chyli and travels cephalad (►Fig. 4). It ascends
between the aorta and azygos vein laterally, immediately
passing through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm at the T12
level. As it travels through the posterior mediastinum, the
thoracic duct remains anterior to the thoracic vertebrate and
intercostal arteries, while staying posterior to the esophagus
and pericardium on the right. At the T5 level, it crosses to the
left side of the thorax, then running posteriorly to the aorta
Fig. 2 Diagram of lymphatic microanatomy. Initial lymphatic vessels converge into collecting lymphatic vessels, which flow into lymph nodes.
Initial lymphatics have leaky flap junctions allowing fluid to enter while collecting lymphatics have tight junctions surrounded by smooth muscle
to propel lymph forward.

and subsequent common carotid. The thoracic duct contin￾ues to ascend until the C7 level, at which point it descends
toward the subclavian and terminates in the venous circula￾tion (►Fig. 5).
The thoracic duct, like large caliber arteries, possesses
three layers of tissue—intima, media, and adventitia. The
media consists of smooth muscle which contracts to assist in
lymph flow. Much like other portions of the lymphatic
system, the thoracic duct contains predominantly bicuspid
valves interspersed throughout to prevent regurgitant flow,
especially at lymphatic-venous junctions.14 The thoracic duct
receives all the lymph produced in the body except for the
right hemithorax, right head and neck, and right upper
extremity. This side of the body has a separate path into
the venous circulation via the right lymphatic duct, which
similarly empties into the angle between the right subclavian
and right jugular trunk (►Fig. 1).
Soft-Tissue Compartment
The soft-tissue lymphatic compartment is the most dis￾persed lymphatic compartment and includes dermal, mus￾cular, and vascular lymphatic networks. The diverse drainage
patterns are specific to the respective regions of the body.
Soft-tissue lymphatics are important in immune function,
fluid resorption, and macromolecular transport.
Dermal lymphatics are especially important for immune
function, with skin dendritic cells utilizing initial dermal
lymphatics as entry into the lymphatic system. Initial dermal
lymphatic tips are found just below the epidermis, forming a
two-dimensional polygonal web of initial lymphatic vessels
10 to 20 µm in diameter.2,15 From this web, larger lymphatic
vessels arise to travel deeper into the dermis as the network
takes on a more three-dimensional appearance, later con￾verging on collecting lymphatics in the subcutaneous layer.
As dermal lymphatics progress to larger calibers, their drain￾age patterns typically follow arterial supply routes (►Fig. 6).
Muscular lymphatics assist mostly with fluid resorption
and removal of metabolites. During exercise, normal physiol￾ogy leads to a marked increase in capillary filtration. Conse￾quently, muscular lymphatics show a dramatic increase in
lymphatic fluid uptake and flow. Skeletal muscle lymphatics
typically follow the arterial distribution for muscular blood
supply, with initial muscular lymphatics wrapping around
penetrating arterioles or venules within the muscle.2 Notably,
these lymphatics lack a smooth muscle layer for intrinsic
contractile pumping and instead rely on surrounding skeletal
muscle contractions to propel their lymph proximally.
Vascular lymphatics are found surrounding major vessels
like the aorta, coronary arteries, pulmonary artery, pulmo￾nary vein, and vena cava. Vessels within the thoracic cavity
drain to the para-aortic lymph nodes and thoracic duct.
These lymphatics are found within the adventitia of the
vessel wall and have important lipid removal properties,
with several studies demonstrating lymphatic insufficiency
leading to atherosclerotic and intimal plaque build-up.16
Intestinal Lymphatic Compartment
The small and large intestinelymphatics are responsible for fat
absorption, immune surveillance, and fluid balance, with the
small intestine lymphatics being the most extensive and
nuanced network. Theinitial smallintestinallymphatic vessels
are found within the villi of the small intestine and are termed
“lacteals” (►Fig. 7). Each villus contains a single lacteal sur￾rounded by a dense arteriovenous capillary network, which is

sidewalls to the retroperitoneum overlying the spine.

responsible for long-chain fatty acid transport. Short-chain
fatty acids are metabolized in situ by colonocytes and medi￾um-chain fatty acids are delivered to the liver by the portal
vein. Meanwhile, long-chain fatty acids are packaged into
chylomicrons and sent into the systemic circulation by small
intestinal lymphatics.2 These initial lacteals drain into a sub￾mucosal lymphatic network which then converges on mesen￾teric collecting lymphatics.
Mesenteric lymphatics will drain into various lymph
nodes, with different intestinal regions draining to different
lymph nodes. The drainage patterns typically follow the
corresponding intestinal arterial supply. Intestinal regions
supplied by the superior mesenteric artery will drain to a
cluster of nodes named the superior mesenteric lymph
nodes. Likewise, regions supplied by the inferior mesenteric
artery will typically drain to a single node named the inferior
mesenteric or caudal lymph node.17 These nodes will even￾tually drain into the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct, ulti￾mately emptying their lipid-rich contents into the venous
circulation for further transport.
The intestinal mucosa contains various gut-associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT), also known as Peyer’s patches,
which screens intestinal contents for harmful microbes.
Native immune cells present in this lymphoid tissue differ￾entiate between pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Like
lymph nodes in the soft tissue, Peyer’s patches house in￾creased numbers of dendritic cells and T-cells. They also
contain M-cells, which are gut-specific antigen-presenting
cells. The GALT contains most of the body’s immunologic
cells, with some estimating 70% of all immunologic cells to be
found in the GALT.18
Moreover, novel research has demonstrated the important
role intestinal lymphatics play in endocrine signaling, specifi￾cally regarding incretin transport. Incretins, major pharma￾ceutical targets for diabetic treatments, include glucose￾dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon￾like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). These signaling molecules travel fur￾ther and at higher concentrations in lymphatics than in blood,
providing an exciting target for future drug delivery.2,19

Hepatic Lymphatic Compartment
Hepatic lymphatics are intimately associated with liver
function and lymph supply, producing 25 to 50% of the total
lymph in the body.20 The liver receives blood from both the
hepatic artery and the portal vein. The hepatic artery delivers
fresh, oxygenated blood from the heart, while the portal vein
delivers deoxygenated, nutrient-rich blood from the intesti￾nal veins. The classical functional unit of the liver is the
microscopic hexagonal liver lobule. Within each lobule,
small branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein join to
form hepatic sinusoids, which are small fenestrated capillar￾ies allowing arterial and portal blood to freely mix. The
sinusoids are surrounded by functional hepatocytes and
between them exists the perisinusoidal space of “Disse.”
This space is where nutrients, cells, and fluid are exchanged
between blood and hepatocytes and is also where most of the
hepatic lymph is formed.21 Excess fluid in the space of Disse

flows between hepatocytes and then along channels parallel
to the sinusoids. These channels drain into several initial
lymphatic vessels located near branches of the portal vein
within each liver lobule (►Fig. 8). These lymphatic vessels
are named periportal lymphatics due to their proximity to
the portal vein.
The hepatic lymphatics are divided into deep and super￾ficial divisions, with some further subdividing the deep
division into portal tract lymphatics and sublobular hepatic
vein lymphatics. Most hepatic lymph is carried by the deep
division, with up to 80% of hepatic lymph originating from
portal tract lymphatics.20 The deep hepatic lymphatics drain
much of the liver parenchyma, with the portal tract lym￾phatics and the sublobular hepatic vein lymphatics each,
respectively, following the course of the portal triad and
hepatic vein (►Fig. 9). The portal tract lymphatic division
specifically flows to groups of lymph nodes in three regions:
near the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, near the
hepatic artery and celiac trunk, and near the posterior
pancreatic head.22 From these nodes, lymph converges on
the para-aortic lymph nodes, which ultimately drain into the
thoracic duct.23 The superficial hepatic lymphatics drain the
liver capsule and underlying serosa but is much less system￾atic or standard in its initial drainage. It also ultimately drains
to the thoracic duct.22 These complex hepatic lymph node
and lymph drainage patterns are important in preventing
hepatic injury, but also leave the liver vulnerable to hepatic
tumor metastases and are hypothesized to be the etiology
behind chylous ascites.2,23
Endocrine Lymphatics
The lymphatic system also plays an important, yet often
overlooked, role within the endocrine system, with lym￾phatics extending into the thyroid, pancreas, and gonads.
Like hepatic lymphatics, most solid-organ lymphatics are
divided into superficial and deep branches (i.e., lungs, kid￾neys, heart). The thyroid gland possesses a network of
anastomosing lymphatics that both surround the capsule
and penetrate between follicles; it has not been shown to
extend into the parathyroid glands.2 Thyroid lymphatics
typically follow the thyroid arterial circulation glands and
are functionally significant in thyroid hormone transporta￾tion.2 Early studies demonstrated thyroid lymph to have an
increased thyroxine and thyroglobulin concentration com￾pared with thyroid venous blood and may serve as a reservoir
for thyroid hormone.24
Daily pancreatic lymph production is relatively small, and
the lymphatic network has not been shown to extend into
the islets of Langerhans. However, initial pancreatic lym￾phatic vessels are found at the exocrine acinar cells and
extend to the pancreatic ducts and connective tissue.2 Lymph
from the pancreas drains either directly into the thoracic
duct or to the cisterna chyli.25

Gonadal lymphatics have mostly been studied in animals.
Both ovarian and testicular lymphatics have been shown to be
extensive in reach and function. Like thyroid lymphatics,
gonadal hormones are found at increased concentrations with￾inlymph, similarlyimplying that gonadallymphaticsmay serve
as a hormone reservoir. Specifically, ovarian steroid hormones
within ovarian lymph are found at higher concentrations than
peripheral blood, but lower than ovarian venous blood.2 Like￾wise, testicular lymph was shown to have up to 10 times the
concentration of estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate relative to testicular venous blood.26 Testicular lymph
notably did not show a significant role in testosterone transport
or storage.27 Gonadal lymphatic physiology requires additional
research to better understand its scope, but its drainage patters
are crucial for interpreting gonadal tumor metastases.
Conclusion
Previously understudied, lymphatics are an emerging fron￾tier in medicine. An understanding of lymphatic anatomy
and physiology will further allow for novel lymphatic-based
pharmaceuticals and interventions, further transforming
treatment paradigms.
