Heart failure and increased arterial stiffness are associated with declining renal function. This longitudinal study was designed
to assess whether the combination of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and the ratio of brachial pre-ejection period
(bPEP) to brachial ejection time (bET) was independently associated with renal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD), stages 3–5. The baPWV and bPEP/bET values were measured using an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device in
186 patients who were classified into 4 groups according to the baPWV and bPEP/bET median values. Renal function change
was determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. Rapid renal progression was defined as an eGFR slope less
than 3 ml min 1 per 1.73 m2 per year. The renal endpoints were defined as commencement of dialysis or X25% decline in
eGFR. Among the four study groups, the group with high baPWV and bPEP/bET values had the lowest eGFR slope (Pp0.042).
Multivariate analysis revealed that this group was independently associated with rapid renal progression (odds ratio, 9.560;
P ¼ 0.009) and progression to renal endpoints (hazard ratio, 2.587; P ¼ 0.039). Our findings show that a combination of high
baPWV and bPEP/bET is associated with adverse renal outcomes in patients with advanced CKD. Screening CKD patients by
baPWV and bPEP/bET during the same examination may help identify patients with an elevated risk for adverse renal outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
The risk for renal dysfunction progression is influenced by both
traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia
and proteinuria, and non-traditional risk factors, including cardio￾vascular disease and arterial stiffening.1,2 Heart failure can facilitate
renal dysfunction progression through a variety of pathophysiological
mechanisms, including hemodynamic factors, systemic
neurohormonal factors, drug treatment and anemia.3,4 Increased
arterial stiffness is also reported to have a role in renal dysfunction
progression.5–7
A clinical device has been developed to automatically and
simultaneously measure blood pressure in both arms and ankles,
and record pulse waves of the brachial and posterior tibial arteries,
using an automated oscillometric method. This device facilitates a
simple measurement of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV)
values, which are a good marker of arterial stiffness.8 In addition, this
device can automatically calculate the brachial pre-ejection period
(bPEP) and brachial ejection time (bET) by analyzing
electrocardiograms, phonocardiograms and right brachial pressure–
volume waveforms. Therefore, we can obtain baPWV and bPEP/bET
values during the same examination. Recent studies in patients
combined with non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD demon￾strated that impaired left ventricular systolic function and increased
arterial stiffness were associated with adverse renal outcomes.9,10
We previously reported that the bPEP/bET ratio shows a significant
correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction in CKD patients11
and bPEP/bET influences the relationship between baPWV and
left ventricular diastolic function. Therefore, dividing patients into
four groups using baPWV and bPEP/bET is useful in staging
cardiovascular dysfunction.12 However, no study has evaluated the
association between cardiovascular dysfunction and renal dysfunction
progression in CKD patients. The aim of this study was to assess
whether the combination of baPWV and bPEP/bET is useful in
identifying stage 3–5 CKD patients at risk for adverse renal outcomes.

METHODS
Study patients
The study was conducted in a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. Patients
with atrial fibrillation and complete left bundle branch block were excluded.
We consecutively enrolled 243 stage 3–5 CKD patients from our Outpatient
Department of Internal Medicine from July 2009 to February 2010. We
classified patients with evidence of kidney damage lasting for more than 3
months into CKD stages 3, 4 and 5, based on estimated glomerular filtration
rates (eGFR) of 30–59, 15–29 and o15 ml min1 per 1.73 m2, respectively.13
Nine patients with inadequate image visualization were excluded. Thirty
patients with fewer than three follow-up eGFR measurements were also
excluded. Patients entering dialysis therapy (n ¼ 10) or who were lost to
follow-up (n ¼ 8) within 3 months of enrollment were excluded to avoid
incomplete observation of renal function change. Ultimately, 186 patients with
normal sinus rhythm were included in this study. The protocol was approved
by our Institutional Review Board, and all enrolled patients provided written
informed consent.
ABI, baPWV and bPEP/bET measurement
Both bPEP and bET were measured by an ABI-form device (VP1000; Colin
Co. Ltd., Komaki, Japan) that automatically and simultaneously measures
blood pressures in both arms and ankles using an oscillometric method.8,14
bET was measured from the foot to the dicrotic notch (equivalent to the
incisura on the downstroke of the aortic pressure wave contour produced by
the closure of aortic valve) of the pulse volume waveform. The total
electromechanical systolic interval (QS2) was measured from the onset of
the QRS complex on electrocardiogram to the first high-frequency vibration of
the aortic component of the second heart sound on the phonocardiogram.
bPEP was automatically calculated by subtracting the bET from the QS2. The
ABI and baPWV values were also measured using a method that has been
reported and validated in previous studies.8,14,15
Collection of demographic, medical and laboratory data
Demographic and medical data, including age, gender, smoking history (ever
vs. never) and comorbid conditions, were obtained from medical records or
patient interviews. Body mass index was calculated as the ratio of weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg m2). Laboratory data
were measured from fasting blood samples using an autoanalyzer (D-68298
Mannheim COBAS Integra 400, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). Serum creatinine was measured by the compensated Jaffe´ (kinetic
alkaline picrate) method in a Roche/Integra 400 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics)
using a calibrator traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry.16 The eGFR
values were calculated using the four-variable equation from the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease study.17 Proteinuria was assessed with dipsticks
(Hema-Combistix, Bayer Diagnostics, Dublin, Ireland). A test result of 1 þ or
more was defined as positive. Blood and urine samples were obtained within 1
month of enrollment. Information regarding patient medications, including
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, b￾blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics taken during the study period,
was obtained from medical records.
Definition of rapid renal progression and renal endpoints
The rate in renal function decline was assessed by the eGFR slope, defined as
the regression coefficient between eGFR and time in units of ml min1 per
1.73 m2 per year. At least three eGFR measurements after the ABI-form device
examination were required to estimate the eGFR slope. Any reduction greater
than 3 ml min1 per 1.73 m2 per year was considered a rapid renal progres￾sion.18 Renal endpoints were defined as commencement of dialysis or X25%
decline in eGFR since enrollment. In patients reaching renal endpoints, renal
function data were censored at the start of dialysis or when a decline in eGFR
X25% was observed. The remaining patients were followed until March 2011.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. The data are
expressed as percentages, the mean±s.d., the mean±s.e. of the mean for eGFR
slope, or the median (25th–75th percentile) for triglyceride levels and the
number of serum creatinine measurements. The patients were stratified into
four groups according to baPWV and bPEP/bET values. Multiple comparisons
among the study groups were performed by a one-way analysis of variance
followed by post-hoc tests adjusted with a Bonferroni correction. The
association of antihypertensive agents with baPWV and bPEP/bET was
assessed with independent t test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
employed to identify risk factors associated with rapid renal progression.
Time to renal endpoints of commencement of dialysis or X25% eGFR
decline and covariates of risk factors were modeled using the Cox proportional
hazards model. Significant variables in univariate analysis were selected for
multivariate analysis. A difference was considered significant if the P value
was o0.05.
RESULTS
A total of 186 non-dialyzed CKD patients were included in this study.
The sample set comprised 123 males and 63 females with a mean age
of 63.4±12.5 years. The average eGFR slope value for all patients was
1.33±0.23 ml min1 per 1.73 m2 per year. The average number of
serum creatinine measurements during the follow-up period was 6
(25th–75th percentile: 5–7.25, range: 3–45). baPWV did not correlate
with bPEP/bET (r ¼ 0.001, P ¼ 0.992). The study patients were
stratified into four groups according to the median baPWV
(1783.5 cm s1) and bPEP/bET (0.351) values. The comparison of
clinical characteristics among the study groups is shown in Table 1.
There were 46, 47, 47 and 46 patients in the 4 groups. The eGFR slopes
were 0.66±0.37, 1.69±0.43, 1.00±0.48 and 3.28±0.48mlmin1
per 1.73 m2 per year. Figure 1 illustrates the eGFR slopes among the
four study groups. The group with high baPWV and bPEP/bET had
the lowest eGFR slope (Pp0.042). Calcium channel blocker use
correlated with baPWV (P ¼ 0.028) and bPEP/bET (P ¼ 0.012), and
diuretic use correlated with bPEP/bET (P ¼ 0.022).
Risk of rapid renal progression
Table 2 shows the determinants of rapid renal progression (eGFR
slope o3 ml min1 per 1.73 m2 per year) using multivariate
forward logistic regression analysis among study patients. In the
univariate regression analysis, rapid renal progression was found
to be significantly associated with smoking history, high mean
arterial pressure, high body mass index, low baPWV with high
bPEP/bET, high baPWV with low bPEP/bET, high baPWV and
bPEP/bET (vs. low baPWV and bPEP/bET), low albumin, high
triglycerides, high total cholesterol, low baseline eGFR, high uric
acid, proteinuria, and use of b-blockers, calcium channel blockers,
or diuretics. Following a multivariate forward analysis, we deter￾mined that high baPWV and bPEP/bET (odds ratio, 9.560;
P ¼ 0.009), low albumin, high total cholesterol, proteinuria and
calcium channel blocker use were independent risk factors for
rapid renal progression. The interaction between baPWV and
bPEP/bET on rapid renal progression was statistically significant
(Po0.001).
Risk of progression to renal endpoints
The mean follow-up period was 22.1±13.4 months, during which 51
patients showed 425% eGFR decline and 2 patients began hemo￾dialysis (28.5%). Data from the multivariate forward Cox propor￾tional hazards regression analysis for renal endpoints is shown in
Table 3. The univariate regression analysis showed that smoking
history, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, high baPWV and bPEP/
bET (vs. low baPWV and bPEP/bET), low albumin, high triglycerides,
low hematocrit, low baseline eGFR, high uric acid, proteinuria,
baPWV and bPEP/bET with renal outcomes in CKD

angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II recep￾tor blocker use, calcium channel blocker use and diuretic use were
significantly associated with an increased likelihood of progressing to
renal endpoints. Following multivariate forward analysis, the high
baPWV and bPEP/bET (hazard ratio, 2.587; P ¼ 0.039), low albumin,
low baseline eGFR, high uric acid and calcium channel blocker use
were associated with renal endpoints. The interaction between
baPWV and bPEP/bET on renal endpoints was statistically significant
(Po0.001). Figure 2 illustrates the adjusted Cox regression survival
curves for renal endpoint-free survival in each group. The high
baPWV and bPEP/bET group had lower renal endpoint-free survival
than the low baPWV and bPEP/bET group.
We also analyzed the subgroup patients with ABI 40.9 (n ¼ 177).
After a multivariate forward analysis, high baPWV and bPEP/bET
(odds ratio, 7.901; P ¼ 0.017) was still independently associated with
rapid renal progression, but not with renal endpoints.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that stratifying CKD patients into four groups
using baPWV and bPEP/bET was useful for predicting rapid renal
progression and progression to the renal endpoints of commencement
of dialysis or X25% eGFR decline. Our recent study demonstrated
that dividing study subjects into four groups using baPWV and

bPEP/bET was useful in staging cardiovascular dysfunction.12 In the
current study, we further validated that this classification was useful in
stratifying the risk of renal function progression in CKD patients.
High baPWV and bPEP/bET was independently associated with rapid
renal progression and increased renal endpoints, which suggests that
there might be an interaction between the heart, vessel and kidney.
As cardiac dysfunction predicts poor renal failure prognosis and
vice versa, there has been a recent surge of interest in identifying the
exact pathophysiological connection between heart and kidney failure.
The mechanisms of progressive renal function decline in patients with
cardiac dysfunction are multifactorial and include chronic renal
hypoperfusion, subclinical inflammation, endothelial dysfunction,
accelerated atherosclerosis, increased renal vascular resistance,
systemic neurohormonal factors, pharmacotherapy and anemia.3,4
Some studies have shown that arterial stiffness may also have a
role.5,6 There seems to be a vicious cycle of cardiac dysfunction,
increased arterial stiffness and renal function progression. In our
study, compared with the group with low baPWV and bPEP/bET, the
group with high baPWV and bPEP/bET showed increased risk factors
for renal morbidity, such as higher mean arterial pressure and pulse
pressure, lower albumin and a higher prevalence of proteinuria. Even
after adjusting for confounding factors, high baPWV and bPEP/bET
were still associated with adverse renal outcomes. These results
suggest that cardiac dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness, that
is, cardiovascular dysfunction, might synergistically increase the risk
of rapid renal progression.
Another finding of our study was that of the two groups with high
bPEP/bET, only the group that also had high baPWV had increased
risk for adverse renal outcomes (vs. low baPWV and bPEP/bET).
Different measures of arterial stiffness, that is, augmentation index,
radial-dorsalis pedis PWV and aortic PWV, were reported to be
independent risk factors for renal function deterioration in CKD
patients.5,6 We recently evaluated the influence of baPWV, a marker of
arterial stiffness, on renal function progression in a cohort of patients
with moderate to advanced CKD and found that baPWV was
independently associated with renal function decline and
progression to commencing dialysis or death.7 One possible
mechanism is that increased arterial stiffness might result in greater
transmission of elevated systemic blood pressure to the glomerular
capillaries, thereby exacerbating glomerular hypertension, a major
determinant of progressive renal damage.19,20
Similarly, when comparing the two groups with high baPWV, only
the group that also had high bPEP/bET was associated with adverse
renal outcomes (vs. low baPWV and bPEP/bET). Shlipak et al.18
demonstrated that depressed left ventricular systolic function was an
independent predictor of rapid renal function decline in the elderly.

baPWV and bPEP/bET with renal outcomes in CKD
S-C Chen et al

We recently demonstrated a significant association between decreased
left ventricular ejection fraction and rapid renal function decline.9,21
Therefore, bPEP/bET, a marker of left ventricular systolic function,
might be useful for identifying CKD patients with a high risk of rapid
renal function progression when concurrently assessed with baPWV.
As ABI o0.9 could influence the value of baPWV,22 we further
performed a subgroup analysis of patients with ABI 40.9 and found
that high baPWV and bPEP/bET was still independently associated
with rapid renal progression. However, the group with high baPWV
and bPEP/bET was not associated with renal endpoints, which might
be due to the relatively small sample size (n ¼ 177) and short follow￾up period. A larger scale study with a longer follow-up period is
needed to address this issue.
Blood pressure may influence baPWV and bPEP/bET values.23,24
We evaluated the association of antihypertensive agents with baPWV
and bPEP/bET, and found that calcium channel blocker use correlated
with baPWV and bPEP/bET, and diuretic use correlated with bPEP/
bET. However, the majority of our patients chronically used
antihypertensive medications and we cannot exclude the possible
influence of antihypertensive agents on the present findings. Blood
pressure might also influence renal outcomes in CKD patients.7 We
statistically adjusted for mean arterial pressure in the multivariate
analysis and still found that high baPWV and bPEP/bET was
significantly associated with rapid renal progression and renal
endpoints.
We found that stage 3–5 CKD patients with high baPWV and
bPEP/bET were at greater risk for rapid renal progression and
progression to renal endpoints of commencement of dialysis and
X25% eGFR decline. Screening CKD patients for baPWV and bPEP/
bET during the same examination may help identify a high-risk group
of patients that are more likely to experience adverse renal outcomes.
