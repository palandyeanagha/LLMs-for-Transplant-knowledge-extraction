Abstract
Akita mice are a genetic model of type 1 diabetes. In the present studies, we investigated the phenotype of Akita mice on
the FVB/NJ background and examined urinary nephrin excretion as a marker of kidney injury. Male Akita mice were
compared with non-diabetic controls for functional and structural characteristics of renal and cardiac disease. Podocyte
number and apoptosis as well as urinary nephrin excretion were determined in both groups. Male FVB/NJ Akita mice
developed sustained hyperglycemia and albuminuria by 4 and 8 weeks of age, respectively. These abnormalities were
accompanied by a significant increase in systolic blood pressure in 10-week old Akita mice, which was associated with
functional, structural and molecular characteristics of cardiac hypertrophy. By 20 weeks of age, Akita mice developed a 10-
fold increase in albuminuria, renal and glomerular hypertrophy and a decrease in the number of podocytes. Mild-to￾moderate glomerular mesangial expansion was observed in Akita mice at 30 weeks of age. In 4-week old Akita mice, the
onset of hyperglycemia was accompanied by increased podocyte apoptosis and enhanced excretion of nephrin in urine
before the development of albuminuria. Urinary nephrin excretion was also significantly increased in albuminuric Akita mice
at 16 and 20 weeks of age and correlated with the albumin excretion rate. These data suggest that: 1. FVB/NJ Akita mice
have phenotypic characteristics that may be useful for studying the mechanisms of kidney and cardiac injury in diabetes,
and 2. Enhanced urinary nephrin excretion is associated with kidney injury in FVB/NJ Akita mice and is detectable early in
the disease process.

Introduction
A significant subset of patients with diabetes mellitus develops
diabetic nephropathy (DN) and cardiovascular disease which may
result from a constellation of coexistent risk factors including poor
glycemic control, albuminuria, hypertension and left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH). In the United States, the incidence of diabetes
mellitus has reached epidemic proportions. DN is the most
common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in developed
countries [1]. Moreover, in these diabetic patients, the rate of
heart disease and stroke is 2 to 4 times higher than in patients
without diabetes [2]. Complications of diabetes mellitus are,
therefore, a significant healthcare burden. As a result, much effort
has been devoted to understanding disease mechanisms in diabetes
mellitus with the goal of identifying early markers of diabetic
kidney injury as well as new therapeutic targets for the treatment
of cardiovascular and kidney disease associated with diabetes.
Mouse models of diabetes mellitus are useful for studying both
the pathogenesis and treatment of kidney disease in diabetic
humans because of the potential for genetic manipulation [3].
Unfortunately, current mouse models do not display the spectrum
of pathological and functional characteristics of human diabetes
[3]. In this regard, Akita mice are a mouse model of type 1
diabetes mellitus caused by a spontaneous point mutation in the
Ins2 gene [3], [4], [5], [6]. The renal phenotype of these mice is
significantly influenced by genetic background [3], [4], [5]. Most
studies, however, have utilized Akita mice on the C57BL/6
background and these mice develop only mild kidney disease
including modest levels of albuminuria and renal pathological
changes limited to mesangial expansion [4]. In the present studies,
we investigated the phenotype of Akita mice on a distinct genetic
background: FVB/NJ. This strain is frequently used to create
genetically modified mice because these animals are vigorous
breeders with large litters and have prominent pronuclei, which
facilitate pronuclear injections when creating transgenic animals
[7]. Thus, Akita mice on the FVB/NJ background might offer
advantages in studies using genetic approaches.

Glomerular podocytes are highly differentiated cells that play a
pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration
barrier [8], [9]. In both humans and animals with diabetic kidney
disease, the number of glomerular podocytes is reduced [10], [11],
[12], [13], [14], [15]. While the causes of podocyte loss in DN are
likely multifactorial [15], [16], apoptosis plays a prominent role
[13], [15], [17]. Because podocytes have limited replicative
potential [8], [16], a sufficient loss of podocytes leads to instability
of the glomerular tuft, alterations in the integrity of the glomerular
filtration barrier and eventually glomerulosclerosis [16]. An
important component of the glomerular filtration barrier is the
podocyte protein nephrin [9], [18], [19]. In diabetic kidney
disease, alterations in glomerular expression of nephrin may
contribute to a decrease in the integrity of the glomerular filtration
barrier [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Moreover, the nephrin protein
can be detected in urine of both animals [23] as well as patients
with diabetes mellitus [21], suggesting that it may be a marker of
kidney injury in diabetes [5].
In the present studies, we determined the functional and
structural characteristics of cardiac and kidney disease in FVB/NJ
Akita mice as well as quantitated podocyte number, podocyte
apoptosis and urinary nephrin excretion. The goal of these studies
was twofold. First, a detailed phenotype of FVB/NJ Akita mice has
not been previously reported. We, therefore, carefully character￾ized cardiac and kidney disease in this model and compared our
findings to published studies in other Akita strains to determine
advantages and limitations of the FVB/NJ Akita model. Secondly,
we investigated the temporal relationship between urinary nephrin
excretion and both albuminuria and podocyte apoptosis to
determine if urinary nephrin excretion could be used as a
biomarker of podocyte injury early in the disease process. Our
results suggest that Akita mice on the FVB/NJ background have
phenotypic features that may be useful for studying mechanisms of
kidney and cardiac injury in diabetes mellitus, and that enhanced
urinary nephrin excretion is associated with kidney injury in FVB/
NJ Akita mice and is detectable with the onset of podocyte
apoptosis before the development of albuminuria.
Results
Sustained hyperglycemia and polyuria in FVB/NJ Akita
mice
As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, male FVB/NJ-Ins2+/C96Y mice
(Akita) developed significant hyperglycemia as well as polyuria by
4 and 8 weeks of age, respectively. Fasting blood glucose levels
remained elevated in diabetic mice through the 20-week study
period. Despite severe hyperglycemia, FVB/NJ-Ins2+/C96Y mice
appeared healthy and body weights were similar to non-diabetic
controls (Table 1).
Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetic mice
We measured 24-hour UAE and albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(ACR) to assess glomerular injury in Akita mice. As shown in
Figure 2A, UAE was significantly increased by 8 weeks of age in
diabetic FVB/NJ-Ins2+/C96Y mice compared to their non-diabetic
controls and remained elevated over time. At 20 weeks of age,
albuminuria was increased by greater than 10-fold in FVB/NJ￾Ins2+/C96Y mice compared to their age-matched controls. A similar
pattern was observed with ACR (Figure 2B). As shown in
Figure 2C, there was a significant linear correlation between 24-
hour UAE and ACR for all mice (R2= 0.71; P,0.0001).
Kidney pathology in FVB/NJ Akita mice
As shown in Figure 3A, we found a significant increase in
kidney-to-body weight ratio in FVB/NJ-Ins2+/C96Y mice com￾pared to age-matched controls at 12 weeks of age, which was
sustained at the 20-week time point. In contrast, kidney-to-body
weight ratio was similar in 3-week-old Akita mice and controls
(7.360.2 [Akita] vs. 7.960.3 [control]; P = NS) prior to the
development of either sustained hyperglycemia (155616 mg/dl
[Akita] vs. 173621 mg/dl [control]; P = NS) or enhanced
albuminuria (4067 mg/24 hours [Akita] vs. 3166 mg/24 hours
[control]; P = NS) as previously published [25]. The increase in

kidney size in 12-week-old Akita mice was associated with a
significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared
to controls (Figure 3B). By 20 weeks of age, however, this
hyperfiltration was lost. Examination of the kidney by light
microscopy revealed an increase in glomerular volume in diabetic
mice compared to non-diabetic controls at 20 weeks of age
(3.6960.226105 mm3 [Akita] vs. 2.2360.136105 mm3 [control];
P,0.001). Mesangial matrix area also tended to be increased in
diabetic mice at the 20-week time point; however, this difference
did not reach statistical significance (364620 mm2 [Akita] vs.
349623 mm2 [control]; P = NS). A separate group of mice was,
therefore, studied at 30 weeks of age. As shown in Table 2,
hyperglycemia, albuminuria and GFR were similar to 20-week old
Akita mice at the 30-week time point. In contrast to 20-week old
Akita mice, however, there was a significant increase in mesangial
expansion at 30 weeks of age as depicted in the representative
glomeruli shown in Figure 4. The extent of glomerular mesangial
expansion was scored using a semiquantiative scale of 0–3 (0-
normal, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe) as described previously [4],
[5]. At 30 weeks of age, mesangial score was significantly higher in
Akita mice compared to age-matched controls (1.4160.24 [Akita]
vs. 0.0060.00 [control]; P,0.005). There was also a trend toward
an increase in both glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and
proximal tubule membrane thickness, but these differences did not
reach statistical significance (Table 3). Foot process (FP) efface￾ment was not detected in diabetic Akita mice at 30-weeks of age
(Figure 4E and 4F).
Urinary nephrin excretion and podocyte injury in diabetic
mice
As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, excretion of nephrin in urine
was increased in diabetic FVB/NJ-Ins2+/C96Y mice at 16 and 20
weeks of age and correlated with albumin excretion rates
(R2= 0.57; P,0.0001). To determine if enhanced nephrin
excretion was accompanied by histologic evidence of podocyte
injury, kidneys were harvested from 20-week old mice and both
podocyte number and apoptosis were quantitated as described in
the Methods section. Consistent with the results of other
investigators [13], podocyte number was significantly decreased
in Akita mice compared to controls at 20 weeks of age (Figure 5C).
In contrast, podocyte apoptosis was difficult to detect in either
Akita mice or control animals at this time point.
To determine if urinary nephrin excretion was increased in
normoalbuminuric Akita mice, we measured excretion of nephrin
in urine from 4-week old Akita mice. At this age, Akita mice are
hyperglycemic (Figure 1) but albumin excretion rates are similar to
age-matched controls (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6B, urinary
nephrin excretion was significantly enhanced in 4-week old Akita
mice compared to control animals. We then harvested kidneys and
quantitated both podocyte number and apoptosis (Figure 6C) as
described in the Methods section. In contrast to the 20-week time
point, podocyte apoptosis was significantly increased in Akita mice
compared to control animals with no significant difference in
podocyte number. A few apoptotic cells were also detected that did
not localize to the glomerular area.

Cardiovascular pathology in Akita mice
Systolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly elevated in diabetic
mice at 10 weeks of age compared to control mice (14062 mmHg
[Akita] vs. 13162 mmHg [control]; P,0.05). This increase in
systolic BP was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of
heart-to-body weight in diabetic Akita mice compared to age￾matched non-diabetic controls (6.160.4 mg/g [Akita] vs.
5.160.3 mg/g [control]; P,0.05). Table 4 shows echocardio￾graphic results in mice at 10 weeks of age. Cardiac hypertrophy in
Akita mice was associated with a significant decrease in LV
fractional shortening consistent with LV systolic dysfunction.
There was no statistical difference in interventricular septal width,
posterior wall thickness or LV mass by echocardiography (Table 4).
Histologic examination of Akita hearts revealed interstitial fibrosis
and inflammatory infiltrates in 10-week old mice (Figure 7A and
7B). Analysis of the cardiac pathology using a semiquantitative
scoring system found a statistically significant increase in both
interstitial fibrosis (0.5360.23 [Akita] vs. 0.0060.00 [control];
P,0.005) and inflammatory infiltrates (0.5360.23 [Akita] vs.
0.0060.00 [control]; P,0.005) in Akita mice compared to wild￾type controls. These pathologic changes were accompanied by
enhanced expression of mRNA for the molecular marker of
cardiac hypertrophy b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC) (Figure 7C).
Lastly, we investigated expression of cardiac cytokines and
markers of fibrosis. As shown in Table 5, there was a significant
increase in expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)
in Akita mice compared to controls. Transforming growth factor b
(TGFb) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) also tended
to be increased but these differences did not reach statistical
significance.
Discussion
DN is the most common cause of ESRD in developed countries
[1]. Patients with diabetes are also more likely to develop
cardiovascular diseases including stroke and diabetic cardiomyop￾athy [2]. While BP control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin
system can effectively slow disease progression, current therapies
cannot prevent progressive kidney and cardiac injury in diabetic
patients with established disease [26]. As a result, much effort has
been devoted to developing more effective treatments for kidney

and cardiovascular diseases in diabetic patients. To achieve this
goal, animal models that mimic the human condition would be
useful to better understand pathogenic mechanisms as well as to
evaluate novel treatment strategies. In this regard, accumulating
evidence suggests that glomerular podocytes play a key role in the
pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease [15]. Studies indicate that a
decrease in glomerular podocytes is a characteristic feature of both
humans and animals with diabetic kidney disease [11], [12], [13],
[14], [15], [17]. Because podocytes are terminally differentiated
cells with little potential for proliferation [8], [16], podocytes that
are lost cannot be effectively replaced which may lead to instability
of the glomerular tuft and glomerulosclerosis [16], [27]. We,
therefore, speculated that detecting podocyte injury before
podocyte loss is sufficient to cause glomerular damage might
permit intensification of medical therapies to preserve podocyte
number and, in turn, delay or prevent diabetic kidney disease. In
this regard, urinary excretion of the slit diaphragm protein nephrin
[22], [28], [29] can be detected in diabetic animals at the onset of
albuminuria [23] as well as in normo-, micro- and macroalbumi￾nuric patients with diabetes [21], perhaps reflecting early podocyte
damage. To further determine if nephrin might be a useful early
marker of podocyte injury, we quantitated nephrin excretion in
urine of FVB/NJ Akita mice. We found that the onset of
hyperglycemia in 4-week old FVB/NJ Akita mice was accompa￾nied by an increase in podocyte apoptosis and enhanced excretion
of nephrin in urine before the development of albuminuria.
Urinary nephrin excretion was also increased in older albuminuric
Akita mice and correlated with the degree of albuminuria. While
further studies will be necessary to determine if these findings are
both generalizable to diabetic humans and useful for modifying
treatment strategies, these data, taken together with other
published studies [21], [23], suggest that enhanced urinary
nephrin excretion is associated with kidney injury in diabetes
and can be detected early in the disease process.
We also characterized the cardiac and kidney phenotype of
male FVB/NJ Akita mice and compared our findings to published
studies in other Akita strains (Table 6). We focused on male
animals because female Akita mice are resistant to the develop￾ment of severe hyperglycemia [4], and published data on female
mice are limited. As shown in Table 6, sustained hyperglycemia
was characteristic of male Akita mice on the C56BL/6, DBA/2,
129/SvEv, FVB/NJ and C3H genetic backgrounds. Moreover,
most strains developed hypertension as well as cardiac hypertro￾phy. Hyperglycemia was associated with hyperfiltration, renal

hypertrophy and albuminuria in all genetic backgrounds in which
published data was available. The albumin excretion rate was,
however, variable between strains with FVB/NJ mice developing
the most robust albuminuria. In this regard, UAE in diabetic mice
was elevated more than 10-fold above controls by 20 weeks of age.
This level of albuminuria has been suggested as an important

criterion for validating a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy
[30]. In contrast to albuminuria, however, the histological findings
in the FVB/NJ model were mild and similar to the histological
findings reported on other Akita genetic backgrounds. By 30 weeks
of age, diabetic FVB/NJ Akita mice developed mild-to-moderate
glomerular mesangial expansion as has been reported on the
C56BL/6, 129/SvEv and C3H strains. We did not detect more
advanced lesions, such as glomerular sclerosis, tubulointerstitial
fibrosis, arteriolar hylanosis, GBM thickening or FP effacement
and, to our knowledge, these more advanced histopathological
lesions have not been reported on other genetic backgrounds.
Taken together these data suggest that Akita mice develop early
features of diabetic kidney and heart disease but lack the more
advanced features of these disease processes.
With regard to the current study, FVB/NJ Akita mice have
robust albuminuria compared to other Akita strains but, similar to
other Akita mice, the renal histopathological abnormalities are
mild. These findings suggest a prominent dissociation between the
functional and structural alterations in kidneys from FVB/NJ
Akita mice. In the context of other published studies [5], [31],
[32], these data are consistent with the notion that different genetic
modifiers may separately affect functional and structural responses
to the diabetic environment. Moreover, the robust albuminuria in
FVB/NJ Akita mice compared to other Akita strains [4], [5] might
provide an animal model that could be used to either identify
genetic modifiers of urinary albumin excretion or test effects of
antiproteinuric therapies. Indeed, Chua and coworkers [31]
recently used linkage studies to identify a major locus influencing
both albuminuria and renal pathology in a model of type 2
diabetes on the FVB/NJ background (FVBdb/db mice).
In contrast to available renal functional and histopathological
data in Akita mouse strains, there is limited published data on
podocyte apoptosis and podocyte loss in Akita mice (Table 6).
Similar to our findings in FVB/NJ Akita mice, Susztak et al [13]
reported a significant increase in apoptosis early in the disease
process in C57BL/6 Akita mice with podocyte depletion observed
only in older animals. In the Susztak study [13], podocyte loss was
dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROSs) generation because
treatment with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor attenuated podocyte
loss in this Akita mouse strain [13]. Similarly, we found [25] that
ROSs generation promoted apoptosis of cultured podocytes
through mechanisms that involve, in part, calcineurin (CN)-
dependent induction of the enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and
ROSs generation by COX2 enzymatic activity [25]. This
observation appeared relevant to the in vivo situation because
treatment with the CN inhibitor FK506 attenuated podocyte
apoptosis in FVB/NJ Akita mice [25]. In support of a role for CN
in this apoptotic response, studies by Abboud and coworkers found
that CN activity was increased in rats following induction of
hyperglycemia by streptozotocin (STZ) and treatment with
pharmacological CN inhibitors reduced glomerular hypertrophy
and extracellular matrix accumulation in the STZ model [33].
Taken together, these data suggest that CN and ROSs generation
may play a key role in promoting podocyte loss and may
contribute to glomerular hypertrophy and histopathological
changes in diabetic kidney disease.
Given that hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy are com￾monly associated with diabetes mellitus and contribute to both
cardiac and kidney damage in humans [34], we performed
additional studies to investigate the cardiac phenotype of FVB/NJ
Akita mice. Similar to diabetic humans, FVB/NJ Akita mice
developed an increase in systolic BP, which was associated with
cardiomegaly, LV systolic dysfunction and enhanced expression of
molecular markers of cardiac hypertrophy including b-MHC as
well as interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates.
Similarly, Hong and coworkers reported that Akita mice on the
C57BL/6 background develop cardiac hypertrophy and echocar￾diographic evidence of LV dysfunction [35]. These data indicate
that, in addition to studies of diabetic kidney disease, Akita mice
on the FVB/NJ background may be useful for studying the
mechanisms of cardiovascular injury in diabetes mellitus.
Lastly, in other studies using FVB/NJ mice, albumin excretion
rates have been variable in diabetic animals [30], [31], [32], [36].
For example, Qi and coworkers [36] found that streptozotocin
induced robust increases in 24-hour UAE in FVB/NJ mice but
reported a poor correlation between UAE and ACR in these mice.
Other investigators have reported more modest increases in ACR
in FVB/NJ Akita mice [30]. There are several possible
explanations for these discrepancies. First, it is possible that
albuminuria in this strain may be subject to environmental
influences as suggested by some investigators [37]. Secondly, in
studies using streptozotocin, the non-specific toxicity of this agent
[3] might alter the tubular handling of either albumin or
creatinine. Finally, recent studies suggest that tubular creatinine
secretion accounts for 35% to 50% of the excreted creatinine in
urine of FVB/NJ mice [38], indicating that tubular secretion of
creatinine is an important component of creatinine metabolism in

this strain. In this scenario, high levels of urinary creatinine may
blunt the ACR compared to 24-hour UAE measurements.
In summary, Akita mice on the FVB/NJ background developed
cardiovascular complications and features of early stages of kidney
injury in diabetic humans. FVB/NJ Akita mice developed
sustained and durable hyperglycemia, which was associated with
polyuria, albuminuria, renal and glomerular hypertrophy, glo￾merular mesangial expansion, podocyte apoptosis, a decrease in
podocyte number and increased excretion of nephrin in urine.
Urinary nephrin excretion was enhanced in Akita mice with
albuminuria as well as early in the disease process with the onset of
hyperglycemia and increased podocyte apoptosis but before the
development of albuminuria. FVB/NJ Akita mice also had an
increase in systolic BP and LV mass, which was accompanied by
interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates, echocardio￾graphic evidence of LV systolic dysfunction, and enhanced
expression of molecular markers of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus,
our studies suggest that: 1. Akita mice on the FVB/NJ background
have phenotypic features that may be useful for studying
mechanisms of kidney and cardiac injury in diabetes mellitus,
and 2. Enhanced urinary nephrin excretion is associated with
kidney injury in FVB/NJ Akita mice and is detectable early in the
disease process.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal care conformed to the National Institute of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC (Protocol Registry
Number A007-10-01).
Animals
Male heterozygous FVB/NJ-Ins2+/C96Y mice and wild-type
FVB/NJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME, USA) and then bred at the Genomic Science
Research Building 2 at Duke University Medical Center, Durham,
NC. Mice aged 4 weeks to 5 months old were used for
experiments. To investigate the kidney phenotype mice were
initially studied at 4, 8, 16 and 20 weeks of age and then sacrificed
for tissue harvesting. A separate group of mice was also sacrificed
for tissue harvesting at 30 weeks of age. Another group was studied
at 4 weeks of age and then urine and tissue collected to measure
albuminuria, podocyte apoptosis and podocyte number. To
evaluate the cardiac phenotype, a fourth group of mice was
studied at 10 weeks of age based on pilot studies suggesting that
the elevation in systolic BP observed in Akita mice [4], [5] was
prominent at this time point in FVB/NJ mice. Except for the
fasting blood glucose measurements, all mice had free access to
water and standard rodent chow throughout the study period (Lab
Diet, Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO, USA). Insulin therapy was not
required. Because of the mild hyperglycemia observed in diabetic,
female mice, only male mice were studied in the experiments.
Blood glucose measurements
Fasting blood glucose levels were initially measured at 4 weeks
of age and then at 4-week intervals using an AlphaTRAK testing
system (Abbott Laboratories, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). After
fasting for 6 hours, approximately 2 ml of blood was collected
directly on the testing strip for measurement after puncturing the
lateral saphenous vein with a 25-gauge needle [39]. Free access to
water was provided during the 6 hour fast.

BP measurements
Systolic BP was measured using a computerized tail-cuff system
(Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC, USA) in conscious mice as
previously described [40]. This technique has previously been
shown to correlate closely with intra-arterial measurements [41].
Echocardiographic analysis
Cardiac function and structure were evaluated in conscious
mice at 10 weeks of age using echocardiography (ATL HDI 5000,
General Electric Inc., Schenectady, NY, USA) as previously
described [42]. 2-D guided M-mode and Doppler transthoracic
images were obtained on conscious mice. Left ventricular end
diastolic diameter (LVDd), left ventricular end systolic diameter
(LVDs), interventricular septum width and posterior wall dimen￾sion were measured. Left ventricular fractional shortening was
calculated as (LVDd – LVDs)/LVDd. Mean calculations were
obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles.
Cardiac histopathology
Mice were sacrificed by an intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/
kg pentobarbital sodium (Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, Il,
USA) and exsanguination. Hearts were removed from a group of
mice at 10 weeks of age and weighed. Hearts were then cut
transversely, fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and embedded in
paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) and Masson trichrome for examination by light microsco￾py. Interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrates were assessed
using a semiquantitative scoring system from 0 to 3 as previously
described with a scores of 1, 2 and 3 representing mild, moderate
and severe histological abnormalities and a score of zero
representing the absence of histological abnormalities.
Urinary albumin, creatinine and nephrin measurements
Albuminuria was measured as previously described [43], using a
kit from AssayPro, catalog number: EMS3201-1 (St. Charles, MO,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Creatinine
and nephrin levels in the urine were measured using respective kits
from Exocell, Inc. (Philadelphia, PA, USA) according to directions
of the manufacturer.
GFR measurement
To assess GFR, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–inulin
clearance was measured in conscious mice as described previously
[5] using methods adapted from Breyer and coworkers [44].
Renal histopathology
Mice were sacrificed by an intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/
kg pentobarbital sodium (Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, Il,
USA) and exsanguination. Their kidneys were then harvested for
pathological examination using the following protocol. The left
renal artery and vein were ligated, then the left kidney removed,
decapsulated, and weighed. The abdominal aorta was then tied
superiorly to the right renal artery. The right kidney was then
perfused in situ with 4% paraformaldehyde trough a cannula
inserted into abdominal aorta inferior to the origin of the right
renal artery. The perfused right kidney was removed and
embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with H&E, Periodic
acid-Schiff (PAS) and Masson trichrome for examination by light
microscopy. Glomerular volume was determined from the mean
cross-sectional area of 10 glomerular profiles on each animal using
the method of Weibel-Gomez [45]. The extent of glomerular
mesangial expansion was scored on a scale of 0–3 as described
previously [4], [5]. GBM and proximal tubule basement
membrane thickness were measured using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) by taking images in a sequential fashion from
edge to edge. Basement membrane thickness was then measured
using the orthogonal intercepts method [46]. Results are reported
in nanometers (nm).
Real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from mouse hearts using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA was treated with RNAase
free DNAase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and then reverse￾transcribed with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and oligo (dT) primers. Real-time quantita￾tive PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence
Detector System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Division,
Wellesley, MA, USA) and the universal SYBR Green PCR
master Mix Kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Division,
Wellesley, MA, USA). The amplification signals were analyzed
with Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 7700 Sequence detection software
and were normalized to the endogenous b-actin mRNA level. The
following sequences were used for the primers for mouse b-MHC,
a-myosin heavy chain (a-MHC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),
and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP): b-MHC forward, 59-GAG

Measurement of podocyte apoptosis and podocyte
number by immunohistochemistry
Mouse kidney cortex was embedded in Optimal Cutting
Temperature compound and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Frozen sections were then fixed in acetone and air dried.
Expression of Wilms tumor antigen-1 (WT-1) was assessed by
indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit polyclonal WT-1
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Briefly, slides were treated with 1% Triton-X in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk
in PBS for 30 minutes. The WT-1 antibody was then added at a
1:100 dilution in D-PBS with 5% non-fat dry milk. After 1 hour,
slides were washed 3 times in D-PBS and then incubated for
1 hour with a fluoresceinated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA). After washing, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed
using an ApoTag Red In Situ Apoptosis kit (Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA) according to the directions of the manufacturer. Slides
were then washed 3 times and examined using a Nikon Eclipse
TE2000-S fluorescent microscope. Podocyte number per glomer￾ulus was determined by counting WT-1 labeled podocyte nuclei as
previously described [25]. The number of apoptotic podocytes was
determined by merging the WT-1 and TUNEL labeled images to
detect apoptotic podocytes in all the glomeruli examined and the
data was expressed as the number of apoptotic podocytes per
glomerulus.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean 6 standard error of the mean
(SEM) and statistical analyses were performed using the InStat

computer program (GraphPad Sofware, Inc.). For comparisons of
continuous variables, a test of normality was performed (Kolmo￾gorov–Smirnov test) prior to assessing statistical significance using
either a t-test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney test (nonparametric)
[47] when comparing 2 groups. For comparisons between more
than two groups, a test of normality was performed prior to
assessing statistical significance using either: 1. A one way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferonni multiple
comparisons post test (parametric) [47], or 2. A Kruskal-Wallis
test followed by a Dunn multiple comparisons post test
(nonparametric) [47]. For comparisons of semiquantitative data,
a Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine statistical
significance. P,0.05 was considered to represent a statistically
significant difference.
