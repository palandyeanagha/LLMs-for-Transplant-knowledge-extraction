We investigated viability of hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
identified in contaminated pork liver sausages obtained 
from France. HEV replication was demonstrated in 1 of 4 
samples by using a 3-dimensional cell culture system. The 
risk for human infection with HEV by consumption of these 
sausages should be considered to be high.
Foodborne transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) to 
humans from consumption of undercooked pig liver 
and deer meat has been reported in Japan (1–3). In addition, 
commercial pig livers purchased from local grocery stores 
in Japan, the United States, and Europe were contaminated 
with HEV (4–6). Epidemiologic and PCR results linked 
a cluster of autochthonous acute hepatitis E cases to 
ingestion of raw figatelli, which is a dried, cold-smoked 
sausage containing ≈30% pig liver (7). We investigated the 
viability of HEV in pork liver sausages produced in France.
The Study
Four samples of pork liver sausage (designated 
sausages A–D) collected at the final production stage from 
4 independent manufacturers in 3 locations in southern 
France were found to be HEV positive by using real￾time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Samples were 
tested in 2 institutes, the Animal Health and Veterinary 
Laboratories Agency, United Kingdom, and Wageningen 
University and Research Centre, the Netherlands. Three￾dimensional (3D) cell culture propagation was performed to 
investigate the presence of infectious HEV particles. PLC/
PRF/5 hepatocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture 
Collection 8024) were cultured as a monolayer (2D) at 
37°C in GTSF-2 medium (8) in a 5% CO2
 environment. 
Cells were trypsinized at 95% confluence and resuspended 
in fresh medium to a density of 2 × 105
 cells/mL. Fifty 
milliliters of cell suspension was then introduced into a 
rotating wall vessel with 10 mg/mL of porous Cytodex-3 
microcarrier beads (collagen type I–coated porous 
microspheres, average diameter 175 μm (Sigma, Dorset, 
UK and Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and incubated at 
37°C in 5% CO2
. The cells were incubated for >28 d before 
inoculation to enable complete differentiation.
The inoculum was prepared by homogenizing a 2.5-
mg fragment of each sample with mortar and pestle in 5 
mL of culture medium. The homogenate was centrifuged 
at 8,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was filtered 
sequentially through 1.2-µm, 0.45-µm, and 0.2-µm 
filters to reduce the risk for bacterial contamination. The 
medium was removed from the rotating wall vessel, and 
2.5 mL of inoculum was incubated with the cells for 2 h 
at 35.5°C; at that point, 47.5 mL of fresh medium was 
added. Subsamples of medium (140 µL) were collected in 
duplicate, added to 560 µL of lysis buffer (QIAamp Viral 
RNA Mini Kit; QIAGEN, Crawley, UK, and Venlo, the 
Netherlands), and stored at -20°C until RNA extraction 
was performed.
Both institutes performed real-time RT-PCR by using 
primers and probe as described (9), using the Superscript 
III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System 
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK, and Bleiswijk, the Netherlands).

Negative (water) and positive (extract from positive fecal 
sample, genotype 3) controls were included. 
HEV RNA was detected in the 3D cell culture 
supernatants of all 4 sausage samples up to 8 d postinfection 
(dpi). Thereafter, HEV RNA was detected only in the cells 
inoculated with the sample A homogenate (Figure 1); 
it was assumed that the signals from the other 3 samples 
represented residual inoculum or an abortive infection. The 
sample A culture showed a cycle threshold (Ct
) value of 
27 on the day of inoculation (dpi 0) that increased to 35 on 
dpi 5, continued to increase until dpi 11, when it peaked at 
38 and then began to decrease. A low Ct
 value of 29 was 
observed on dpi 44. Similar results were obtained in the 
laboratory in the Netherlands (Figure 1).
To evaluate the infectivity of progeny viruses from the 
primary inoculation, supernatant positive for HEV by RT￾PCR from dpi 16 was used to infect fresh 3D PLC/PRF/5 
cultures according to the protocol described for the primary 
inoculation. Cells infected with the supernatant from the 
original sample A homogenate cultures had positive HEV 
RNA test results on most days after inoculation; Ct
 values 
remained relatively constant at an average of 37 from 
immediately after inoculation (dpi 0) to the end of the 
experiment at dpi 35.
To compare the cultured virus to the inoculum, a 
partial fragment of the open reading frame 2 of HEV 
extracted from culture subsamples (dpi 16, dpi 55; progeny 
subsample at dpi 35) was sequenced as described (10). 
HEV RNA sequences detected in the culture subsamples 
were characterized and demonstrated 100% identity with 
that of the inoculum (304 bp of open reading frame 2) but 
differed from the control strain used. These sequences were 
confirmed as HEV genotype 3.
Further confirmation of the presence of viable virus 
particles in cell culture was sought by using electron 
microscopy. Supernatants of the cell cultures were applied 
to Pioloform/carbon-coated, 400-mesh copper grids (Plano 
GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) for 10 min, fixed with 2.5% 
aqueous glutaraldehyde solution for 1 min, and stained with 
2% aqueous uranyl acetate solution for 1 min. The specimens

were examined through transmission electron microscopy 
by using a JEM-1010 microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 
an 80-kV accelerated voltage. HEV particles were observed 
in the supernatant of the sample A culture collected at dpi 33 
(Figure 2, panel A). For additional proof by immunoelectron 
microscopy, an Escherichia coli–expressed, His-tagged 
HEV genotype 3 capsid protein derivative harboring amino 
acid residues 326–608 (11) was used to generate HEV￾positive serum in a rabbit by 3 subcutaneous inoculations 
at 4-week intervals (P. Dremsek et al., unpub. data). The 
immunoelectron microscopy examination of this serum 
and goat anti-rabbit IgG linked with 5-nm gold particles 
(BBInternational, Oconomowoc, WI, USA) confirmed the 
presence of HEV particles (Figure 2, panels B–D).
Conclusions
We confirmed that 1 sample of pork liver sausage that 
had positive test results for HEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR 
contained viable HEV. We cultured 4 sausage samples in 2 
different institutes by performing 3D cell-culture propagation 
of HEV; HEV replication was detected in the same sample 
independently in both institutes, and the replicated virus was 
shown to be infectious. We observed entire, cell-free virus 
particles by transmission electron microscopy at dpi 33, 
providing further proof of in vitro replication of the virus 
that contaminated the pork liver sausage. 
We conclude that pork liver sausages can contain 
infectious HEV and that consuming these products should 
be regarded as a risk factor for HEV infection. Furthermore, 
we have shown the potential of the 3D culture system to 
correlate the presence of HEV RNA with the presence of 
infectious HEV particles.
