Abstract
Objective: Left ventricular (LV) remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by progressive alterations of
structure and function, named LV remodeling. Although several risk factors such as infarct size have been identified, LV
remodeling remains difficult to predict in clinical practice. Changes within the extracellular matrix, involving matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), are an integral part of left ventricular (LV)
remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). We investigated the temporal profile of circulating MMPs and TIMPs and their
relations with LV remodeling at 1 year and clinical outcome at 3 years in post-MI patients.
Methods: This prospective multicentre study included 246 patients with a first anterior MI. Serial echocardiographic studies
were performed at hospital discharge, 3 months, and 1 year after MI, and analysed at a core laboratory. LV remodeling was
defined as the percent change in LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) from baseline to 1 year. Serum samples were obtained at
hospital discharge, 1, 3, and 12 months. Multiplex technology was used for analysis of MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -13, and TIMP-1, -
2, -3, -4 serum levels.
Results: Baseline levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9 were positively associated with changes in LVEDV (P = 0.01 and 0.02,
respectively). When adjusted for major baseline characteristics, MMP-8 levels remained an independent predictor LV
remodeling (P = 0.025). By univariate analysis, there were positive relations between cardiovascular death or hospitalization
for heart failure during the 3-year follow-up and the baseline levels of MMP-2 (P = 0.03), MMP-8 (P = 0.002), and MMP-9
(P = 0.03). By multivariate analysis, MMP-8 was the only MMP remaining significantly associated with clinical outcome
(P = 0.02).
Conclusion: Baseline serum MMP-8 is a significant predictor of LV remodeling and cardiovascular outcome after MI and may
help to improve risk stratification.

Introduction
Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction
(MI) is characterized by progressive LV dilatation [1] and
associated with increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular
death [2]. Recent studies have shown that LV remodeling remains
relatively frequent after MI, despite high acute reperfusion rates
and widespread prescription of secondary prevention medications
[3–4]. Although several variables – such as MI size – have been
identified as risk factors [5], LV remodeling remains difficult to
predict in clinical practice. The idea that biological markers might
accurately predict clinical outcome is attractive, and interest is
growing in identifying such markers to assess individual risk in
many medical fields. We previously reviewed the published
evidence about the association of circulating biomarkers with
post-MI LV remodeling: a large number of the associations
concerned biomarkers of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover:
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [6]. Recently, guidelines for the
development of biomarkers emphasize the importance of the link
between the underlying pathophysiology and the predictive
capabilities of the biomarkers chosen. Accordingly, biomarkers
of ECM homeostasis were selected for this study because past
experimental studies have shown that changes within the ECM are
an integral part of post-MI LV remodeling [7]. In various animal
MI models, increased MMP expression occurs during the
development of heart failure [8], MMP inhibition attenuates LV

remodeling [9], and TIMP deficiency accelerates adverse LV
remodeling by promoting ECM degradation [10].
Clinical studies investigating the relations between circulating
MMPs/TIMPs levels and LV remodeling have nonetheless
produced discordant results. Most were relatively small, and the
timing of the evaluation varied greatly. The latter point is
especially important because LV remodeling is a time-dependent
process that continues for 6 to 12 months after MI. Studies with a
shorter follow-up therefore focus only on early remodeling rather
than the entire process. In addition, previous studies with large
cohorts have investigated limited number of MMPs/TIMPs. Most
studies focused on MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 [6] and very
limited information is available on other MMPs/TIMPs such as
MMP-8, TIMP-2, and TIMP-4 that could however be relevant
biomarkers in this setting. In the present study, MMPs/TIMPs
levels were determined with multiplex technology in samples from
the REVE-2 study, which prospectively analysed the relations
between circulating biomarkers and LV remodeling in 246
patients after a first anterior MI and included repeated echocar￾diographic examinations and serial blood sampling in the first year
after MI.
Methods
Study Population
The design of the REVE-2 study has been published in detail
elsewhere [4]. We enrolled 246 patients with a first anterior wall
Q-wave MI between February 2006 and September 2008.
Inclusion criteria were hospitalization within 24 hours after
symptom onset and at least 3 akinetic LV segments in the infarct
zone at the predischarge echocardiography. The Ethics Commit￾tee of the Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Lille approved the
research protocol, and each patient provided written informed
consent. The protocol required serial echographic studies at
hospital discharge (day 3 to day 7) and 3 and 12 months after MI.
Serial blood samples were taken at discharge (day 3 to day 7), and
1, 3, and 12 months after MI.
Echocardiographic Studies
A standard echographic imaging protocol was used based on
apical 4- and 2-chamber views as previously described [3]. All
echocardiograms were analyzed at the Lille Core Echo Laboratory
(Lille, France), as previously described [3]. LV end-diastolic
volume (EDV), LV end-systolic volume (ESV), and LV ejection
fraction (EF) were calculated with a modified Simpson’s rule.
MMPs/TIMPs Measurements
For each patient, serum and plasma (ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) used as anticoagulant) were collected at the 4 times
mentioned above and analysed in a core laboratory (Lille, France).
Serum levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9 and -13 were measured with
a multiplex luminex kit for simultaneous quantitative detection of
human MMPs, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Human MMP Panel Fluorokine Multi Analyte Profiling (MAP)
Kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). MMP-13 was not
detected in our samples (detection limit at 0.71 ng/ml). Serum
levels of TIMP-1, -2, -3 and -4 were measured with a multiplex
TIMP immunoassay (Human TIMP Fluorokine MAP 4-plex Kit,
R&D Systems). TIMP-3 was detected in only one third of our
samples (detection limit at 7.75 ng/ml). Baseline MMP-9 levels
were also measured in all patients’ plasma samples with the
Milliplex MAP Human MMP Panel 2 (Millipore Corp, Billerica,
MA). All samples were analysed with the Bio-Plex system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Experimental data were analysed by fitting a four-parameter
logistic curve to the standard analyte curves.
Clinical Follow-up
Clinical follow-up was performed at outpatient visits or by
contacting the general practitioner or cardiologist between
February 2009 and June 2011. We collected data on death, and
hospitalization for heart failure (symptoms of dyspnea or edema
associated with bilateral rales, elevated venous pressure, or
interstitial or alveolar edema on chest x-ray, or the addition of
intravenous diuretics or inotropic medications).
Statistical Analysis
STATA 9.0 (STAT Corp., College Station, Texas) was used for
the statistical analysis. Results are presented as the mean6SD,
median with 25th and 75th percentiles, or frequency expressed as a
percentage. Variables with skewed distribution were log-trans￾formed before being used as continuous variables in statistical
analyses. Continuous variables were compared with the unpaired
Student’s t-test, or with simple linear regression as appropriate.
Changes in MMPs/TIMPs over time were assessed by repeated￾measures ANOVA with Scheffe’s post-hoc test. All hypotheses
were two-tailed with a 0.05 type I error rate. LV remodeling was
defined as the percent change in LVEDV from baseline to 1 year
follow-up. We analyzed the predictive value of early (baseline and
1 month) levels of MMPs/TIMPs on LV remodeling. Independent
correlates of change in LVEDV were identified by multiple linear
regression. Variables with P,0.10 on univariate analysis were
entered in the multivariable model. Colinearity was excluded by
means of a correlation matrix between candidate predictors. To
illustrate our findings, LVR was defined as a .20% increase in
EDV between baseline and the 1-year follow-up examination, a
definition used previously to indicate severe remodeling [3–4],[11–
12]. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to
determine predictors of clinical outcome. Cumulative survival
was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differ￾ences in survival curves were compared with a log rank test. To
illustrate our findings, baseline levels of MMP-8 were categorized
into tertiles.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline and follow-up data for the REVE-2 cohort have been
published previously [4] and are summarized in Table 1. Briefly,
most patients were men (mean age: 57614 years). Initial
reperfusion therapy was primary percutaneous coronary interven￾tion in 128 patients and thrombolysis in 87; 31 patients did not
undergo reperfusion therapy. Nearly all patients received second￾ary preventive treatments. The baseline LVEF was 4968%.
Temporal Profile of MMPs/TIMPs
Table 2 summarizes serum levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, and
TIMP-1, -2, -4 at baseline and 1, 3, and 12 months after MI.
Overall, 3 temporal patterns were identified: MMP-1 levels
remained stable throughout the study; levels of MMP-2, MMP￾3, TIMP-2, and TIMP-4 were significantly lower at baseline and
increased thereafter; in contrast, MMP-8, MMP-9 and TIMP-1
levels were significantly higher at baseline and decreased during
the chronic phase.
Relations of MMPs/TIMPs with Patients Characteristics
We investigated the relations between baseline levels of MMPs/
TIMPs and major baseline characteristics of the study population

(Table 3). With the exception of MMP-1, -8, and -9, most MMPs/
TIMPs increased with aging. Hypertension and diabetes were
associated with increases in several MMPs/TIMPs, particularly
MMP-3 and TIMP-4. Baseline levels of MMPs/TIMPs did not
change according to reperfusion therapy. Finally, higher levels of
MMP-8 and -9 were observed in patients who experienced heart
failure during hospitalization and in patients with lower LVEF.
Relations of Early MMPs/TIMPs Levels with Subsequent
LV Remodeling
During the 1-year follow-up period, 3 patients died (all from
cardiovascular causes) and 1 patient underwent heart transplan￾tation; these patients were excluded from the remodeling study. In
addition, 3 patients had recurrent MIs during the follow-up
period; these patients were not excluded from the remodeling
study. Echocardiographic follow-up was achieved in 226 of the
242 eligible patients (93%, 1 patient was lost to follow-up and 15
patients declined the repeat echographic studies or had inadequate
image quality for measurement of LV volumes). In the overall
cohort, LV remodeling was documented by an increase in
LVEDV (baseline 52.3614.0 ml/m2
, 1 year 62.3618.4 ml/m2
,
P,0.0001). We first investigated the relations between early
MMPs/TIMPs levels and LV remodeling as a quantitative
variable defined as percent change in LVEDV from baseline to
1-year follow-up (Table 4). Baseline levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9
were significantly and positively associated with LV remodeling.
By contrast, 1-month levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9 were not
associated with LV remodeling. Other MMPs/TIMPs, whether
assessed at baseline or at 1 month, were not associated with LV
remodeling.
When LV remodeling was defined as a .20% increase in
LVEDV from baseline to 1 year, it was observed in 87 patients
(38% of population with echocardiographic follow-up). Baseline
MMP-8 levels were significantly higher in the remodeling group
(21.7 [13.5–31.8] ng/ml) than in the no remodeling group (15.4
[8.5–31.9] ng/ml), P = 0.02. Similar results were obtained for
baseline levels of MMP-9 (526 [355–918] vs 510 [365–692] ng/
ml, P = 0.05).
To take into account potential confounding factors, we
performed multivariate analyses adjusting for major baseline
characteristics (age, gender, body mass index, history of hyper￾tension, diabetes mellitus, prior angina, reperfusion therapy, heart
failure during hospitalization, final TIMI flow grade in the infarct￾related vessel, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, creatine kinase
levels, wall motion score index and LVEF). Because of a high
correlation between MMP-8 and MMP-9 baseline levels
(r = 0.766), we entered them in 2 different models (Table 5). The
baseline levels of MMP-8 were independently associated with LV
remodeling (P = 0.025); the other variable retained into the model
was baseline LVEF. By contrast, the baseline levels of MMP-9 did
not remain associated with LV remodeling when adjusted for
baseline characteristics.
The type of sample, plasma or serum, affects measured
concentrations of circulating MMP-9. As MMP-9 was measured
in plasma in most studies, we also measured it in plasma of 246
patients of the REVE 2 study to strengthen our data. Baseline
plasma MMP-9 concentration was lower than in serum with a
median value of 33 [19–54] ng/ml compared to 518 [355–
804] ng/ml in serum. Baseline plasma MMP-9 level was not
associated with change in LVEDV from baseline to 1 year as a

[19–70] ng/ml) compared to patients with ,20% change in
LVEDV (29 [18–49] ng/ml), P = 0.02).
Clinical Endpoint and Prediction of Outcome
Clinical follow-up data were obtained for 245 patients at a mean
of 1098 days; 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Sixteen patients were
hospitalized for heart failure and 15 patients died (11 from cardiac
causes). We investigated the associations of baseline levels of
MMPs/TIMPs with cardiovascular death or hospitalization for
heart failure. By univariate analysis, 3 MMPs were significantly
and positively associated with clinical outcome: MMP-2 (P = 0.03),
MMP-8 (P = 0.002), and MMP-9 (P = 0.03). However, when
adjusted for major baseline characteristics (age, gender, body
mass index, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior
angina, reperfusion therapy, heart failure during hospitalization,
final TIMI flow grade in the infarct-related vessel, systolic blood
pressure, heart rate, creatine kinase levels, wall motion score index
and LVEF), MMP-8 was the only MMP that remained
significantly associated with clinical outcome (P = 0.02) while
MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not reach statistical significance
(P = 0.327 and 0.311, respectively). To illustrate our results,
baseline MMP-8 levels were divided into tertiles (,12.6 ng/ml
(n = 79), 12.6–26.8 ng/ml (n = 78), .26.8 ng/ml (n = 79)). As
shown in Figure 1, most of the clinical events during follow-up
occurred in patients with MMP-8 levels .26.8 ng/ml
(P = 0.0003).

temporal pattern of many circulating MMPs and all TIMPs during
a one-year follow-up after acute MI and their relation with LV
remodeling and prognosis in a large cohort of patients. Compared
to previous investigations, our study has clear strengths related to
its prospective design: relatively high number of patients, very
homogeneous population with a first anterior ST-elevation MI,
high reperfusion rate, nearly universal use of secondary prevention
treatments, serial blood sampling at pre-specified time points
during one year, and prospective assessment of one-year LV
remodeling with core lab analysis. Another strength is related to
the availability of bead-based multi-analyte profiling technology
that can multiplex many MMPs or all TIMPs in a single sample
and allowed us to study a large panel of biomarkers of ECM
turnover.
Changes in Circulating MMPs/TIMPs Levels during the
Post-MI Period
Numerous studies of animal models have documented selective,
time-dependent modulation of cardiac MMPs and TIMPs after
MI [7]. Because myocardial MMPs and TIMPs during and after
MI are much more difficult to measure in humans, monitoring
their levels/activity in the peripheral blood has emerged as an
alternative strategy. Several studies have demonstrated that
changes in these circulating levels may indeed predict changes
within the myocardium [13]. These MMPs/TIMPs concentra￾tions in the peripheral blood are at best, however, an indicator of a
localized process occurring within the myocardium, and various
interactions might prevent some MMPs or TIMPs from entering
the circulation [7].
Our study, investigating many MMPs and TIMPs by serial
blood samples during a one-year follow-up in 246 patients,
provides an extensive description of the temporal pattern of these
proteins after MI. Specifically, MMP-8, MMP-9 and TIMP-1
peaked early after MI and subsequently decreased during the
chronic stage, while MMP-2, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 also decreased
early. These data are consistent with the findings by Webb et al.
[14]. Finally, we found decreased levels of MMP-3 in the MI acute
phase, as previously described by Samnegard et al. [15]. The
present study, performed in a much larger population, thus
reinforces the concept of a specific temporal post-MI pattern of
MMPs and TIMPs release and probably reflects both a local shift
in cell type activation and ECM proteolytic events.
Preanalytical conditions affect the measurements of circulating
MMPs and TIMPs, including the type of sample (plasma or
serum), the anticoagulant used to collect plasma, and the freeze￾thaw cycles. Here, we found higher MMP-9 concentrations in
serum than plasma, in agreement with previous studies [16]. This
difference might be attributed to the differential release of this
analyte from blood cells during platelet activation or the sampling
process.
Associations of MMPs/TIMPs Levels with LV Remodeling
This study establishes for the first time a positive association
between baseline levels of MMP-8 and the extent of post-MI LV
remodeling. To date, only 2 reports [14,17] have studied this
topic, with negative results possibly due to limited number of
patients (n = 32 and 58, respectively). Although, there is no formal
demonstration in the present study that the circulating MMP-8
derives from the heart, our data are in agreement with
experimental studies suggesting that increased MMP-8 activity in
the infarct area, caused by greater inflammatory cell infiltration,
contributes to infarct rupture in humans [18]. For MMP-9, our
study confirms in serum previous findings of positive relations
between plasma MMP-9 and LV remodeling [14], [19–22]. These
studies, however were often small, and only one included .100
patients [21]. Although our results make MMP-9 one of the
biomarkers most consistently associated with LV remodeling, we
observed that, contrary to MMP-8, it did not remain an
independent predictor when adjusted for major characteristics
and particularly for baseline LVEF as an indicator of infarct size.
It must also be pointed that the association of MMP-8 and MMP-9
with LV remodeling was solely observed in baseline samples, and
not in 1 month samples; this suggests that the early expression of
MMP-8 and MMP-9 may indicate the onset of intramyocardial
processes that will ultimately lead to LV dilatation and dysfunc￾tion.
We found no association of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 with LV
remodeling. Two previous studies have reported positive associ￾ations for MMP-3 [23–24]. Discordant results have been
published for TIMP-1: one group found that TIMP-1 concentra￾tion correlated with LV volumes and remodeling in a cohort of
404 MI patients [21] but not in a separate cohort of 100 MI
patients [25]. Methodological differences between the studies
might explain these discrepancies. In addition, as with all negative
results, our data must be interpreted taking into account the
statistical power of the study; with a 2-sided alpha error of 0.05
and 80% power, our sample size allowed to detect a 10%
difference in MMP-2, a 15% difference in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, a
25% difference in TIMP-4, a 30% difference in MMP-3, and a
35% difference in MMP-1, between patients with LV remodeling
and patients without LV remodeling.
Associations of MMPs/TIMPs Levels with Clinical
Outcome after MI
Because LV remodeling is associated with increased risk of
death an heart failure in post-MI [2], we investigated the
associations of MMPs and TIMPs to cardiovascular outcome
and found that baseline levels of MMP-8 predicted prognosis after
MI. MMP-8 remained a significant predictor after adjustment for
major baseline characteristics including LVEF. To date only a few
studies have investigated the association of MMP-8 with cardio￾vascular outcome. In the study of Tuomainen et al. [26], higher
levels of MMP-8 were associated with the worst cardiovascular
outcome in patients with atherosclerosis, possibly because of the
involvement of MMP-8 in vascular matrix remodelling and
rupture of unstable plaques [27]. Our study is the first to show
that serum MMP-8 is an independent predictor of outcome in
post-MI patients. The significant association between MMP-8 and
LV remodeling, suggests that the worst cardiovascular outcomes
might be explained by increased ECM myocardial remodeling.
Clinical Implications - Conclusions
Our data on MMPs/TIMPs reinforce current knowledge about
the involvement of this system in LV remodeling and heart failure.
Although validation is required in large series of patients with
clinical follow-up, our study suggests that the early determination
of serum MMP-8 and MMP-9 levels might help to detect patients
at risk of LV remodeling. In addition, early MMP-8 is an
independent indicator of prognosis in post-MI patients. Early
identification of patients most susceptible to LV remodeling and
poor outcome might encourage more aggressive therapy for this
high-risk group. Finally, it remains to be established whether
modifying these changes in circulating MMPs/TIMPs profiles in
the post-MI period would improve the clinical course.
