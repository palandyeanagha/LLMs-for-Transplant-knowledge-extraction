Abstract
Background-Experience of liver trans￾plantation in haemophiliacs with end
stage hepatitis C liver disease is limited
and particularly difficult questions are
raised when there is also HIV infection.
Aims-This is the first report in Great
Britain to describe the operative re￾placement therapy and initial outcome in
four haemophiliacs with end stage HCV
cirrhosis.
Patients-Two patients had factor VIII,
one had factor IX, and one had factor X
deficiency. One patient had also con￾tracted HIV infection from factor re￾placement but had no AIDS defining
illnesses.
Methods-Intraoperatively patients were
given either factor VIII infusions, factor
IX bolus, or fresh frozen plasma, ac￾cording to formulae devised to calculate
exact clotting factor requirements. Base￾line preoperative coagulation studies
included prothrombin time, activated
partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen
concentrations, and factor VIII, IX, and X
concentrations. Factor concentrations
were then assayed at 12, 24, 48, and 72
hours postoperatively.
Results-Postoperatively all patients had
coagulation factor concentrations sus￾tained within the normal ranges by 72
hours unsupported (137, 125, 95, 104
IU/di), representing de novo synthesis by
the graft. Transfusion requirements
during the operative and immediate post￾transplant period were no greater than
those of patients without clotting
disorders. Two patients had episodes of
bleeding postoperatively, one ofwhich was
fatal, occurring at the site of a previous
untreated subdural bleed. In both in￾stances the bleeding occurred in the
presence of normal concentrations of
clotting factor. The remaining three
patients are at 6, 6, and 12 months post￾transplant and remarkably improved
clinically with sustained factor concentra￾tions. One patient has evidence of graft
dysfunction from HCV recurrence and all
have evidence of recurrent viraemia with
HCV on polymerase chain reaction
studies.
Conclusions-Orthotopic liver trans￾plantation should be considered in
haemophiliac patients with end stage liver
disease from hepatitis C infection with or
without concomitant HIV infection. Their
clinical condition is likely to be greatly
improved by orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion and the haemophilia cured with only
a small risk of severe graft dysfunction
from recurrent HCV infection.

Keywords: liver transplantation, haemophilia, hepatitis

Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) was
virtually universal in haemophiliacs who
received repeated pooled clotting factor
concentrates until the introduction of more
effective methods of viral inactivation (heat
treatment in 1985, solvent detergent method in
1987) primarily designed to reduce the risk of
HIV infection. Of the estimated 3200 haemo￾philiacs in the United Kingdom infected with
HCV,' many are also coinfected with HIV.
Two recent reports suggest that HIV sero￾positivity in this group may be as high as
40-60%.3 3The estimated cumulative risk of
developing hepatic decompensation in haemo￾philiacs with HCV infection is 1 7% at 10 years
and 19.8% at 20 years after first exposure to
the virus.3 However, data from Eysher et a12
showed that HCV infection can have a more
aggressive course in those coinfected with HIV,
with the incidence of liver failure increasing
to 17% at 10 years. Risks of hepatic de￾compensation were greater with a more
rapid decline in the CD4 count and the
development of p24 antigenaemia, correlating
with higher levels of viraemia. At the present
time, only a minority of haemophiliacs in the
United Kingdom have developed cirrhosis;
however, it is likely that, over the next 5-10
years, even with the use of interferon, a sizeable
number of these patients will progress to end
stage liver disease and meet the requirements
for orthotopic liver transplantation. After early
animal studies in 1974 by Webster and
colleagues, dogs with haemophilia B (factor IX
deficiency) were transplanted, and these
experiments showed that normal clotting
function could be achieved post-transplanta￾tion.4 To date, there have been seven reports
of haemophiliacs being transplanted for end
stage liver disease. Starzl's group reported the
first two successful cases of transplantation in
two patients with haemophilia and chronic
liver disease between 1982 and 1985. This was
followed by several reports of patients with
both factor VIII and IX deficiency being given
transplants.5-9 These earlier cases of trans￾plantation for chronic liver disease were

Liver transplantation for haemophiliacs with hepatitis C cirrhosis
secondary to chronic hepatitis B infection as
well as a non-A non-B hepatitis although not
isolated as hepatitis C antibody positive at the
time. Causes of death in these earlier cases
included intraoperative bleeding and systemic
sepsis. Despite the obvious benefits of
correction of clotting disorder after liver
transplantation, significant concerns have been
expressed, including the risks of bleeding
during transplantation, the frequent concomi￾tant HIV infection, and the likely probability of
recurrent HCV infection within the graft. We
report here the clinical course and outcome of
orthotopic liver transplantation in four haemo￾philiacs with end stage HCV cirrhosis, one of
whom was HIV antibody positive, together
with the unique factor replacement schedules
used during and after surgery.
Methods
Between June 1994 and April 1995, four men,
aged between 27 and 54 years and with haemo￾philia, underwent orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion. Of these, two had factor VIIIC deficiency
(haemophilia A), one had factor IX deficiency
(haemophilia B or Christmas disease), and one
had mild factor X deficiency. No patient had
a plasma inhibitor detected on routine coagula￾tion studies. All four patients had decompen￾sated end stage liver disease secondary to HCV
infection, with positive HCV antibody and
HCV RNA, the infection having been acquired
through contaminated clotting factor infusions
given before 1985. Patient 3 was known to be
HIV antibody positive at the time of his
transplantation, but had remained asympto￾matic from his HIV disease and in particular,
had had no AIDS defining illnesses since his
diagnosis.
CLOTTING FACTOR REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE
Baseline preoperative coagulation studies
consisted of prothrombin time (PT), activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrino￾gen concentrations, and factor VIII, IX, or X
concentrations, and screening for inhibitor to
coagulation factor. Factor concentrations were
then assayed at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours
postoperatively. For patients 1 and 3 with
factor VIIIC deficiency, an initial preoperative
intravenous bolus of factor VIII was given. The
required amount in international units (IU)
was calculated by the equation:
(1 00-baseline value) Xbody weight (kg)
2
This was followed by an intraoperative
infusion at a rate of 2 IU/kg/h. Postoperatively
this was decreased to 1 IU/kg/h when the
International Normalised Ratio (INR) was less
than 2.2 and ceased altogether at an INR less
than 1.5. The INR was used as a marker for
recovery of hepatic function and synthesis of
clotting factors, rather than as a direct marker
of factor VIII concentration. Factor VIII
infusion was given via a central venous access
to avoid peripheral vein thrombophlebitis.
For patient 4, with factor IX deficiency, an
initial preoperative intravenous bolus of factor
IX was given with the required amount in IU
being calculated by the equation:
(1 00-baseline value) Xbody weight (kg)
This was supplemented by intermittent
intravenous boluses intraoperatively as re￾quired. At 12 hours, if factor IX concentration
was less than 30 IU then a 50 lU/kg bolus was
given, if the concentration was greater than 30
IU but less than 50 IU then 25 lU/kg was
given; once the concentration was greater than
50 IU no further supplement was required.
For patient 2, with mild factor X deficiency,
the standard intraoperative transfusion regime
for orthotopic liver transplantation was used,
with fresh frozen plasma and platelets given as
required. Four further units of fresh frozen
plasma were given postoperatively to sup￾plement factor X concentration and to keep the
INR less than 1. 5.
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
With the exception of patient 3, the standard
orthotopic liver transplantation procedure with
the use of venovenous bypass was performed.
Patient 3 was younger and had normal renal
function, allowing him to tolerate caval
clamping more easily than the other patients.
A further reason to avoid the use of bypass in
this case was to limit the potential exposure of
infective HIV blood products to the theatre
staff. Techniques employed to minimise blood
loss included the use of the cell saver to return
washed red cells to the patients. Routine
infective precautions were adhered to in￾cluding the use of blunt needles in closure of
the abdominal wound.
Case histories
CASE 1
A 47 year old man with mild haemophilia A
(factor VIIIC concentration of 23 IU/dl, NR
50-150) first became jaundiced in 1982 and
was referred to King's College Hospital in
1991. At that time, his serum aspartate
transaminase (AST) was raised to 500-600
IUAl and a liver biopsy showed features of an
active cirrhosis. He was seropositive for both
anti-HCV antibody (second generation im￾munosorbent assay (ELISA 2)) and HCV
RNA (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)). He was treated with
a-interferon for nine months, but had
biochemical and virological relapse towards the
end of that period. Over the next 12 months
he deteriorated with recurrent episodes of
variceal bleeding, diuretic resistant ascites, and
severe lethargy, accompanied by a significant
worsening of hepatocellular function (INR 1.6,
albumin 24, bilirubin 85). In June 1994 he
underwent orthotopic liver transplantation.
The immediate postoperative course was
uneventful apart from one episode of acute
cellular rejection at day 10. At three months he
developed abnormal liver function tests and

thrombocytopenia. Liver histology was sug￾gestive of cytomegalovirus hepatitis, confirmed
by serology, which resolved with intravenous
gancyclovir. Postoperatively he remains sero￾positive for HCV RNA and a recent liver
biopsy performed at nine months post￾transplantation, after liver function test
abnormalities, showed features consistent with
a progressive active hepatitis. He has since
been started on antiviral treatment with
ribavirin. His factor VIII concentrations
remain in the normal range at 12 months
follow up.
CASE 2
A 54 year old man with factor X deficiency
(factor X concentration of 31 IU/dl, NR
50-150) first developed abnormal liver
function tests in 1991. On referral to King's
College Hospital he was found to be
seropositive for both anti-HCV antibody
(ELISA-2) and for HCV RNA (RT-PCR).
Serum AST ranged between 200 and 300 IU/1
although a liver biopsy was not performed
because of the severity of his clotting disorder.
A trial of interferon was complicated by
significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count
30X 1o9/1) and was discontinued after nine
months with only slight biochemical im￾provement. Subsequently he deteriorated with
intermittent episodes of confusion and the
eventual development of grade 4 encephalo￾pathy. Synthetic function worsened with an
INR of 2.1, albumin 19, and bilirubin 105). In
February 1995 he proceeded to an orthotopic
liver transplantation. At operation, histology of
the explained liver showed an active cirrhosis.
His postoperative course was uneventful with
no episodes of rejection or sepsis. Postopera￾tive serum assays have shown continuing sero￾positivity for HCV RNA; however, a liver
biopsy performed at two months does not show
any histopathological evidence of an active
hepatitis. Factor X concentrations have
remained within the normal range at six
months after the transplant.
CASE 3
A 27 year old man with severe haemophilia A
(factor VIIIC 4 IU/dl) had experienced re￾current haemarthroses resulting in chronic
arthropathy despite regular factor VIII
concentrate. Since 1990, he had been noted to
have hepatosplenomegaly with abnormal liver
function tests and was found to be seropositive
for both anti-HCV antibody (ELISA-2) and
for HCV RNA (RT-PCR). Serum AST con￾centrations ranged between 100-200 IU/1 and
a subsequent liver biopsy confirmed an active
cirrhosis. At the same time he was found to be
coinfected with HIV and for this reason he was
not treated with interferon. Over the past five
years his CD4 counts were stable between 280
and 300X 106/1 and he had remained well with
no symptoms or AIDS defining illnesses. From
November 1994 he deteriorated with diuretic
resistant ascites, debilitating lethargy, and
worsening of synthetic function (INR 1-8,
albumin 25, and bilirubin 60). He underwent
orthotopic liver transplantation in February
1995. His postoperative course was compli￾cated at 48 hours by retroperitoneal haemo￾rrhage and renal failure secondary to renal vein
compression. Following an evacuation of the
haematoma at laparotomy, when several small
bleeding vessels were isolated in the
retroperitoneum and haemostasis quickly
achieved with diathermy, his renal function
was restored. At two months post-transplant
he had a mild rise of his AST to 170 IU/1. Liver
biopsy showed features of a mild cholangitis
but no rejection or features of a viral hepatitis.
However, he too shows continuing positivity
for HCV RNA by PCR. His factor VIIIC
concentration remains within the normal range
at six months follow up.
CASE 4
A 49 year old man with severe haemophilia B
(factor IX concentration of 3 IU/dl, NR
50-150) and a significant degenerative arthro￾pathy from multiple interarticular bleeds
earlier in life, was found to be hepatitis C
antibody positive (ELISA 2) on routine testing
in 1990. He first developed abnormal liver
function tests in 1992 and received a
12 month course of interferon between
November 1992 and October 1993, which was
discontinued after a biochemical relapse and
poor tolerance. He has since been found also
to be positive for HCV RNA (RT-PCR) but
negative for HIV. During this period he also
had a small left sided subdural haematoma,
confirmed on computed tomography, which
did not require any neurosurgical intervention.
He had an index variceal bleed in September
1994 and has had three further bleeds since,
accompanied by a significant deterioration of
synthetic function (INR 1.5, albumin 19, and
bilirubin 73). He underwent orthotopic liver
transplantation in April 1995. At day 10
postoperatively, he developed acute renal
failure, secondary to cyclosporin toxicity,
which required intermittent haemodialysis
(urea 37, creatinine 540). On day 14 he had
graft dysfunction with a rise in his AST to 220
IU/1. He was treated for acute rejection with
three days of intravenous methylprednisolone.
On the morning of day 18 he developed an
intermittent generalised headache without any
accompanying focal neurological signs and
collapsed while undergoing haemodialysis.
Brain computed tomography confirmed a large
left sided subdural haematoma in the same site
as his previous bleed. An evacuation of the clot
that night was not successful and he died on
day 20 post-transplantation. At the time of his
subdural bleed factor IX concentration was
within the normal range at 104 IU/dl.

Liver transplantation for haemophiliacs with hepatitis C cirrhosis
transplantation (NR 50-150 IU/dl). Despite
cessation of supplemental factor VIIIC
infusion at 48 hours concentrations remained
within the normal range at 72 hours with values
of 137 and 95 IU/dl, representing de novo
synthesis of factor VIIIC by the grafts.
Similarly, despite several episodes of tempor￾ary graft dysfunction in the postoperative
course of patient 1, with acute cellular
rejection, CMV hepatitis and recurrent
hepatitis C infection of the graft, concentra￾tions have remained within the normal range
at up to 12 months follow up. Patient 3 has had
little graft dysfunction since his operation apart
from a mild episode of cholangitis at two
months; however, his concentration has
remained normal at 165 IU/dl (Table I and
Figure).
The preoperative concentration of factor X
in patient 2 rose from 31 IU/dl and reached 54
IU/dl by 12 hours (NR 50-150 IU/dl). The
patient received 16 units of fresh frozen plasma
intraoperatively to supplement his factor X
concentration but did not require any
additional fresh frozen plasma post-trans￾plantation. Concentrations were sustained at
24 hours at 72 IU/dl, representing graft
synthesis of factor X. The patient's own pro￾duction of factor X by his graft has maintained
his concentrations within the normal range at
up to six months without any intervening graft
dysfunction.
Baseline factor IX concentration in patient 4
rose from 3 IU/dl to 68 IU/dl at 12 hours
(normal range 50-150 IU/dl). He required one
intraoperative bolus of factor IX concentrate
but by 12 hours he was synthesising adequate
concentrations by his own graft. At 24 and
48 hours, concentrations were similarly
maintained within the normal range at 81 and
113 IU/dl. Measurements on samples taken
within two hours of his intracerebral bleed
confirmed that factor IX concentration had
still been maintained within an accepted
normal range at 104 IU/dl, suggesting that,
despite a recent episode of graft dysfunction
from acute rejection, his concentration had not
fallen and contributed to the bleed. Concentra￾tions had therefore been maintained up to 18
days in this patient.
INTRAOPERATIVE LOSSES AND SUPPLEMENTS
Intraoperative blood losses for the four patients
during transplantation were similar to other
patients without clotting disorders (Table II).
Similarly, this group of patients did not require
any additional supplementation with blood

products (apart from fresh frozen plasma for

point of view they were at no greater risk of
bleeding during the procedure itself.
Discussion
These results show that patients with severely
decompensated chronic liver disease and
accompanying clotting factor deficiencies of
either VIII, IX, or X, can be safely brought
through orthotopic liver transplantation with￾out excessive transfusion requirements, pro￾vided that appropriate factor replacement
regimens are used. Close cooperation is
required between the transplant team and the
transfusion department at all stages of the
procedure. The use of the continuous
intravenous infusion of factor VIII during the
surgical procedure, as decribed here, provides
a more reliable and predictable factor VIII
concentration. Monitoring can be reduced and
the amount of factor VIII used is 40% less than
that used by conventional bolus regimes, as
described in the previous reports. At the initial
assessment it is important to qualify the factor
deficiency and to determine whether an
inhibitor is present. Predictable rises in factor
concentration after replacement are more
difficult to achieve when an inhibitor can be
detected and this situation may pose more of
a bleeding risk of the patient. The two bleeding
complications in this series were in patients 3
and 4 although neither patient had a detectable
fall in their factor concentration at or near the
time of their bleed. Patient 3 recovered
completely from his retroperitoneal bleed at 48
hours postoperatively, with a concentration of
85 IU/dl at the time and as there was no
spontaneous bleeding from his wound or drain
sites, it would seem unlikely that his bleeding
was a direct result of a clotting disorder. The
subdural haematoma in patient 4 was similarly
not associated with a fall in factor concentra￾tion, at 104 IU/dl, and was most likely related
to his renal impairment and his previous
intracerebral bleed. This case helps dem￾onstrate that certain groups of haemophiliacs
may be at later risk of bleeding complications
and these must include those who have had
significant previous intracerebral bleeds.
In earlier reports, restoration of normal
factor VIII concentration was not achieved
until 10 days post-transplantation, indicating
the possibility of delayed early de novo
synthesis by the allograft as a result of poor
intrinsic graft function.5 In our series, normal
clotting factor concentrations were achieved as
early as 12 hours and in all cases had been
sustained within a normal therapeutic range by
72 hours. As the half life of factors VIII, IX,
and X are all less than 72 hours, this must
represent de novo synthesis of factor by the
new graft. Although graft dysfunction will
result in impairment of clotting factor
production leading to decreased plasma con￾centration, this does not apply to factor VIII in
these situations as it often acts as an acute
phase reactant, resulting in an initial rise in
serum concentration. Similarly, in patients
with fulminant hepatic failure due to a viral
hepatitis, increases in factor VIII concentration
are seen compared with the other factors,
which are reduced. Likely mechanisms for this
effect are an increased synthesis secondary to
cytokine release.
Given current statistics and treatment an
increasing proportion of patients with HIV
infection will survive up to 10 years after
seroconversion without developing AIDS'l and
the proportion coinfected with HCV are more
likely to die as a result of end stage liver disease
than HIV complications. HIV used to be
regarded as an absolute contraindication to
transplantation, as patients were thought to be
at an increased risk of opportunistic infections.
However, patients have now been successfully
transplanted who were knowingly or un￾knowingly HIV antibody positive at the time of
transplantation."` 12 In a recent review by
Schwartz and colleagues, of 53 transplanted
patients with HIV infection caused by either a
blood transfusion or an infected transplant, the
cumulative incidence of developing the AIDS
syndrome was significantly lower in the 40 who
received cyclosporin A as part of the im￾munosuppression regimen (31 %) than in 13
patients not given cyclosporin (90%).12 The
best long term data currently on survival of
HIV positive transplanted patients is from
Starzl and colleagues" who reviewed 25
transplanted patients who were either HIV
positive before transplantation or who
seroconverted postoperatively. Of the 15 who
had had liver transplants, seven were known to
be HIV positive at the time of transplant and
eight later seroconverted after their transplant.
When this group was compared with liver
transplants overall, there was no difference in
survival at one year but by five years survival
was 53% in the HIV positive group compared
with 63% overall. In vitro studies have shown
that both cyclosporin and tacrolimus (FK506)
reduce cell to cell transmission of HIV-1 virus
and can also significantly reduce the yield of
infectious HIV by 100-fold.'3 Both groups of
drugs were found to inhibit the growth of
infected cells at concentrations that did not
impair the growth of uninfected cells. Recent
studies have shown that tacrolimus was more
potent than cyclosporin in decreasing CD4+
expression in cultured murine microglia,
concluding that overall both drugs may have
some potentially beneficial role in the
treatment of patients with HIV disease.'4
The exact role of HIV coinfection in HCV
related liver disease remains unclear but
evidence suggests that it may accelerate the

rate of hepatic decompensation.3 15 16 Replica￾tion of HCV may be enhanced resulting in a
greater viral load and greater extent of hepato￾cyte damage.3 Telfer et al reported an associa￾tion between the rate in decline of CD4 cells,
p24 antigenaemia, and the risk of hepatic de￾compensation to cirrhosis.3 Coinfection with
HIV would also be expected to increase the
severity of recurrent HCV infection of the
graft.
Recurrence of HCV. infection is virtually
universal after liver transplantation for
hepatitis C cirrhosis. Most patients develop
acute hepatitis in the graft during the early
postoperative period2 and most will develop
chronic liver disease. 17-19 Although the clinical
course of recurrent HCV infection is usually
benign, some patients may develop rapidly
progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis
and graft loss within five years.20 The possible
host and viral factors associated with this
accelerated graft damage have not yet been
identified, although in addition to coinfection
with HIV, the degree of HLA donor/recipient
mismatch, HCV genotype, and level of
immunosuppression have all been suggested.21
