Abstract
Links between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and several non-Hodgkin lymphomas have been sug￾gested by epidemiological studies. We herein report the first documented case of a patient with HCV￾associated Hodgkin lymphoma who showed a marked regression following interferon-based antiviral therapy.
This unique case extends the spectrum of HCV-associated malignant lymphomas, confirms the efficacy of an￾tiviral therapy for this rare extrahepatic manifestation and provides valuable clues for achieving a better un￾derstanding of lymphomagenesis in HCV.

Introduction
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is well recognized as being
the main causative agent of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (1). Recent epidemiological studies
have indicated links between HCV infection and several
types of malignant lymphomas (2). Importantly, all of these
cases have been categorized as B cell non-Hodgkin lympho￾mas (NHL). The development of Hodgkin lymphomas has
not been previously reported. We herein report a case of
HCV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma classified as nodular
lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) in
which a marked response to interferon (IFN)-based therapy
was achieved.
Case Report
A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treat￾ment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). He was infected with
the HCV genotype 1b and had a viral titer of 5.2 Log cop￾ies/mL. A physical examination showed no specific findings.
Liver function test results and tumor markers, including al￾pha fetoprotein (AFP), protein induced by vitamin K ab￾sence or antagonist II (PIVKAII) and soluble IL-2 receptor
(sIL2-R), were within normal ranges. An initial contrast￾enhanced computed tomographic (CE-CT) scan revealed en￾largement of multiple lymph nodes with a maximum size of

4 cm in the para-aortic and external iliac regions (Fig. 1A).
Hepatocellular carcinoma was not detected. The tentative di￾agnosis was malignant lymphoma. Laparoscopic resection of
the left external iliac lymph node was performed in order to
make a definitive diagnosis. A histopathological analysis
demonstrated the presence of a vaguely nodular lymphoid
proliferation with mottled areas (Fig. 2A). A higher power
view revealed the presence of Reed Stenberg cell (RSC)-like
large atypical cells (Fig. 2B) that showed positivity for clus￾ter of differentiation (CD) 20 (Fig. 2C), B-cell lymphoma
(BCL) 6 (Fig. 2D) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA)
(Fig. 2E) and negativity for CD30 and CD15 (not shown)
surrounded by small CD3-positive T cells (not shown).
Based on these findings, a diagnosis of NLPHL was thus
made.
Considering the indolent nature of NLPHL and the grow￾ing consensus that NLPHL may not require aggressive treat￾ment, unlike classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) (3, 4), we
gave higher priority to the treatment of CHC and thus
started Peg- IFNα2a and Ribavirin combination therapy in
the standard regimen for 48 weeks. Serum HCV RNA was
undetectable after two weeks and a sustained virological re￾sponse was achieved. A series of follow-up CE-CT studies
demonstrated a striking regression of lymphadenopathy after
24 weeks (Fig. 1B) and durable remission throughout the
course of therapy.
Discussion
Previous clinical observations have indicated links be￾tween HCV infection and several types of lymphoma, in￾cluding marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lym￾phoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (2). Importantly,
all of these are categorized as B cell NHL. This is the first
documented case of HCV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma
classified as NLPHL. The response to antiviral therapy ob￾served in this case, which was analogous to that reported in
B cell NHL (5-7), strongly supports the existence of an etio-

logic link between NLPHL and HCV infection.
In contrast to CHL, NLPHL is characterized by the pres￾ence of large atypical variants of RSCs, termed lymphocytic
and histiocytic cells or popcorn cells, with a germinal center
B cell-like phenotype (i.e. CD20+/BCL6+) (3, 4, 8). This
phenotype indicates a close relationship between NLPHL
and B cell NHL. Indeed, NLPHL reportedly overlaps with
or progresses to T cell/histiocyte rich B cell lymphoma, a
subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (3). Although the
mechanisms whereby HCV infection causes B cell malig￾nant lymphoma remain to be clarified, working hypotheses
propose that either persistent HCV antigen stimulation re￾sults in clonal expansion of B cells that finally leads to the
development of lymphoma or that HCV infection itself is
directly oncogenic in B cells (2, 5). Therefore, considering
the resemblance of NLPHL to B cell NHL, it is tempting to
speculate that these mechanisms could also be applied to the
development of NLPHL. Accordingly, the anti-lymphoma
effects of IFN observed in the present case might be attrib￾utable to the eradication of HCV by IFN. In addition, the
direct anti-tumor effects of IFN through such mechanisms as
the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex anti￾gens or activation of natural killer and cytotoxic T cell ac￾tivity might also operate and synergistically contribute to the
regression of NLPHL (9).
In summary, we herein report a case of HCV-associated
NLPHL in which a marked regression was achieved with
IFN-based antiviral therapy. The current case not only ex￾tends the spectrum of HCV-associated malignant lymphoma,
but also provides clues for better understanding lymphoma￾genesis in HCV. Primary treatment of HCV infection with
IFN should be considered for this rare type of HCV￾associated lymphoma.
