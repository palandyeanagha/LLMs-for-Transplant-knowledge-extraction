Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) are a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of
inherited myopathies characterized by aggregation of Z-disc proteins. Mutations in
desmin account for ∼7% of MFM. We report here a Hmong family with an autosomal
dominant MFM caused by a novel variant in the desmin gene. The proband presented
with lower limb followed by upper limb weakness starting in the 5th decade. On
examination, there was distal more than proximal muscle weakness. One sibling was
similarly affected, while another had an asymptomatic elevation of creatine kinase.
Genetic testing revealed a novel p.Ser13Tyr variant, which was predicted by in
silico algorithms to alter protein function. Muscle biopsy revealed a MFM. Muscle
MRI demonstrated selective involvement of the tensor fasciae latae, semitendinosus,
sartorius, gracilis, gastrocnemius, soleus, and peroneus longus muscles. In this family,
the histological and MRI findings assisted in the interpretation of genetic testing results.

INTRODUCTION
Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) are a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of inherited
myopathies histologically characterized by aggregation of Z-disc proteins (1). Mutations in
11 different genes have so far been found to cause MFM (2, 3), but approximately half of
patients remain without a molecular diagnosis (4). The increasing availability of genetic testing
by next-generation sequencing has also led to the identification of many variants of unknown
significance (VUS) in genes known to cause MFM. In light of the paucity of functional assays
available for most forms of MFM, it is often challenging to determine the pathogenicity of these
variants. Muscle MRI however has shown promise in distinguishing certain forms of MFM from
other distal myopathies based on patterns of muscle involvement and may similarly be of assistance
in the interpretation of VUS (5). We report here a family with an adult-onset distal myopathy
caused by a novel heterozygous missense variant in the desmin gene and highlight the role of muscle
MRI in interpreting genetic testing results in this family.
CASE REPORT
The proband was a 47 year-old man of Hmong descent who presented with a 5-year history of
progressive lower limb followed by upper limb weakness. Neurological examination revealed severe
distal weakness in the upper and lower limbs, along with a mild to moderate degree of proximal
weakness. The patient’s 50 year-old sister was more severely affected, requiring assistance walking.

size, increased endomysial and perimysial connective tissue, rimmed vacuoles, and hyaline inclusions with increased immunoreactivity for desmin (C), dystrophin (D),
αB-crystallin (E) and myotilin (F), indicating a myofibrillar myopathy. Scale bar = 50µm.
She started noticing the weakness at age 37, and had no
cardiac involvement. A 52 year-old brother had asymptomatic
elevated CK level (493 U/L, normal <171). An 80 year-old
paternal aunt has become wheelchair bound from the myopathy,
which started around age 50. The proband’s father had died
at age 53 of lung cancer without displaying any signs of
neuromuscular disease. Family members were not available for
detailed clinical evaluation.
The proband had a creatine kinase level of 669 U/L (normal
< 308 U/L). An electromyogram revealed rapid recruitment of
complex short duration motor unit potentials in all muscles
examined, mixed with long-duration motor unit potentials in
some proximal muscles. Fibrillation potentials were present
in most muscles. A biopsy of the left quadriceps showed
non-specific changes. An echocardiogram did not reveal evidence
of a cardiomyopathy, while an electrocardiogram showed a
first-degree atrioventricular block.
A next-generation gene panel targeting 121 known myopathy
genes revealed a heterozygous VUS in DES (c.38C>A;
p.Ser13Tyr) and a homozygous VUS in RYR1 (c. 12880A>G;
p.Thr4294Ala). Neither variant was present in population
databases, nor known to be disease-causing. The DES variant was
predicted by three in-silico algorithms to adversely affect protein
function, while the RYR1 variant was predicted to be benign.
Segregation analysis was subsequently performed. The DES
variant was present in the affected sister and in the brother
with elevated CK level, but absent in an unaffected sister. By
contrast, the RYR1 variant did not segregate with the phenotype.
A repeat muscle biopsy of the right quadriceps showed findings
typical of MFM (Figure 1). A muscle MRI demonstrated atrophy
and fatty replacement most severely affecting the tensor fasciae
latae, semitendinosus, sartorius, gracilis, gastrocnemius, soleus
and peroneus longus muscles (Figure 2). By contrast, the
biceps femoris, semimembranosus and tibialis anterior were
relatively spared.
DISCUSSION
Herein, we report a Hmong family with an autosomal dominant
distal myopathy and asymptomatic hyperCKemia due to
the p.Ser13Tyr missense variant in the desmin gene. The
distal-predominant weakness observed in the proband
is typical of desminopathy (6). Cardiomyopathy, which
is common in desminopathy patients, was absent in this
family (6, 7).
The findings observed on muscle biopsy establish the
presence of a MFM and thus support the pathogenicity of the
mutation in DES. The serine residue at position 13 is highly
conserved and serves as a phosphorylation site for protein
kinase C (8). Its functional importance is demonstrated by the
existence of another pathogenic substitution affecting the same
amino acid, p.Ser13Phe. Patients carrying this variant typically
present with a severe cardiac phenotype, which may occur in
isolation or in association with proximal or distal weakness
(8–10). The absence of the c.38C>A variant from population
databases and its segregation in the family provide additional
supportive evidence of its pathogenicity, as do the proband’s
MRI findings.
Imaging studies have identified two distinct patterns of
muscle involvement in MFM. Selective involvement of the
semitendinosus, sartorius, gracilis, and peroneus longus

FIGURE 2 | MRI findings. Axiat T1-weighted MRI images of the proximal thigh
(A), largest diameter of the mid-thigh (B) and largest diameter of the mid-calf
(C) demonstrate grade IV (>50% of the muscle) atrophy and fatty replacement
of the tensor fasciae latae (A—red), semitendinosus (B—blue), sartorius
(B—yellow), gracilis (B—green), gastrocnemius (C—orange), soleus
(C—purple), and peroneus longus (C—tan) muscles. The biceps femoris

muscles is typical of desminopathies and αB-crystallinopathies
(11–13). By contrast, a mirror image is seen in myotilinopathies
and filaminopathies, in which there is involvement of the
biceps femoris, semimembranosus, tibialis anterior, medial
gastrocnemius and soleus. Fischer et al. reported that
among a group of 46 MFM patients, MRI involvement
of the semitendinosus equalling or exceeding the biceps
femoris and involvement of the peroneal muscles equalling
or exceeding the tibialis anterior predicted the presence of
a desminopathy with 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity
(12). It should be noted however that selective involvement
of the semitendinosus has also been reported in hereditary
myopathy with early respiratory failure caused by titin
mutations and is therefore not pathognomonic of desminopathy
(14). While muscle MRI was successful in distinguishing
myotilinopathy from other distal myopathies (5), its sensitivity
and specificity for desminopathy in this context remains to be
established. In inherited myopathies, MRI should therefore be
interpreted in the context of the clinical picture and results of
molecular genetic testing. Muscle MRI can also assist in the
interpretation of VUS, particularly in genes such as DES, in
which a distinctive imaging pattern of muscle involvement has
been described.
