Abstract
Renal dysfunction frequently occurs during the periods preceding and following orthotopic
liver transplantation (OLT), and in many cases, renal replacement therapy (RRT) is req￾uired. Information regarding the duration of RRT and the rate of kidney function recovery
after OLT is crucial for transplant program management. We evaluated a sample of 155 sta￾ble patients undergoing post-intensive care hemodialysis (HD) from a patient population of
908 adults who underwent OLT. We investigated the average time to renal function recovery
(duration of RRT required) and determined the risk factors for remaining on dialysis > 90
days after OLT. Log-rank tests were used for univariate analysis, and Cox proportional haz￾ards models were used to identify factors associated with the risk of remaining on HD. The
results of our analysis showed that of the 155 patients, 28% had pre-OLT diabetes mellitus,
21% had pre-OLT hypertension, and 40% had viral hepatitis. Among the patients, the
median MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score was 27 (interquartile range [IQR]
22-35). When they were listed for liver transplantation, 32% of the patients had serum creati￾nine (Scr) levels > 1.5 mg/dL or were on HD, and 50% had serum creatinine (Scr) levels >
1.5 mg/dL or were on HD at the time of OLT. Of the transplanted patients, 25% underwent
pre-OLT intermittent HD, and 14% and 41% underwent continuous renal replacement ther￾apy (CRRT) pre-OLT and post-OLT, respectively. At 90 days post-OLT, 118 (76%) patients
had been taken off dialysis, and 16 (10%) patients had died while undergoing HD. The
median recovery time of these post-OLT patients was 33 (IQR 27–39) days. In the multivari￾ate analysis, fulminant hepatic failure as the cause of liver disease (p<0.001), the absence
of pre-OLT hypertension (p = 0.016), a lower intraoperative fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)
transfusion volume (p = 0.019) and not undergoing pre-OLT intermittent HD (p = 0.032)

were associated with performing RRT for less than 90 days. Therefore, a high proportion of
OLT patients showed improved renal function after OLT, and those who were diagnosed
with fulminant hepatic failure, had no pre-OLT hypertension, received a lower transfused
volume of intraoperative FFP and did not undergo pre-OLT intermittent HD had a higher
probability of recovery.
Introduction
In the MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score era of organ allocation, which consid￾ers serum levels of creatinine and bilirubin and the international normalized ratio of the pro￾thrombin time, patients are prioritized based on measures of preoperative renal dysfunction.
Between 5% and 35% of liver transplant patients require perioperative dialysis for renal repla￾cement therapy (RRT) [1]. Information regarding a patient’s RRT duration requirements and
probability of kidney function recovery is crucial for transplant program management.
Patients with liver disease and advanced irreversible renal disease are typically considered
for a combined liver and kidney transplant [2, 3]. In contrast, patients with acute kidney injury
(AKI) can have improved renal function after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and thus
are considered for isolated liver transplantation. AKI patients may remain on RRT post-trans￾plant for various periods of time, and some may never spontaneously recover renal function.
These patients will then need a kidney transplant [4].
Isolated liver transplant recipients who remain on RRT during the post-transplant period
have lower survival rates than those who undergo subsequent kidney transplantation [5, 6].
However, given the shortage of available organs, it is essential to determine the optimal length
of time a physician should wait before deciding that a patient undergoing post-OLT RRT has
an irreversible AKI and thus needs kidney transplantation. This approach may avoid unneces￾sary transplantation in a patient whose native kidney function could eventually improve.
We investigated a group of 155 stable patients undergoing post-intensive care dialysis fol￾lowing OLT to evaluate the average time to renal function recovery (duration of RRT) and fac￾tors associated with remaining on dialysis > 90 days after OLT in an urban tertiary medical
center in São Paulo, Brazil. We consider renal function recovery the suspension of dialysis,
and the average time to renal function recovery (duration of RRT) refers to the interval
between the date of OLT and the date of the last hemodialysis session performed.
Materials and methods
Study population
In this retrospective study, we evaluated a sample of 155 stable patients undergoing post-inten￾sive care dialysis from a patient population of 908 adults who underwent OLT between June 1,
2005, and December 31, 2011, at Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil, an urban
tertiary medical center. All the patients required RRT [intermittent hemodialysis (HD)] for
presumed AKI during the postoperative period. Combined liver-kidney transplant recipients
were excluded from the study due to the possibility of concurrent chronic kidney disease.
For each patient, the following data were collected: age; gender; pre-transplant diabetes
mellitus and hypertension status; etiology of liver disease (viral hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis,
fulminant hepatic failure or other); MELD score; history of hepatocellular carcinoma; pre￾OLT continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and pre-OLT intermittent HD; history

and volume of intraoperative packed red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and cryopre￾cipitate and platelet transfusion; length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay during transplant hos￾pitalization; and duration of pre-OLT RRT. CRRT was performed as continuous venovenous
hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with the Prismaflex1 system (Gambro, Lakewood, CO, USA)
in hemodynamically unstable patients in the ICU. The need for early liver retransplantation
(re-OLT) or post-OLT CRRT was noted. Additionally, the presence of serum creatinine (Scr)
levels > 1.5 mg/dL or the need for RRT at the time of listing for liver transplantation or at the
time of transplant was determined. The etiology of renal dysfunction was not assessed in our
study due to its frequent inaccuracy. Tacrolimus levels were routinely monitored and were
kept within the therapeutic range.
We evaluated the average time to renal function recovery in OLT patients undergoing post￾intensive care hemodialysis (HD) and determined the risk factors for remaining on dialysis >
90 days after OLT. Renal function recovery was defined as no longer needing RRT. Patients
were censored at the time of recovery of kidney function, death on HD, or at the end of follow￾up.
Statistical analysis
Unadjusted post-transplant survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared
using log-rank tests. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate fac￾tors associated with renal function recovery, and the results are presented as hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for those remaining on HD after 90 days. The data
were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science) 17.0 for Windows. Statis￾tical significance was set at p < 0.05. Continuous and categorical variables were expressed as
medians [quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3)] and as counts and percentages, respectively.
Approval was obtained from the local ethics committee, and formal informed consent was
waived due to the observational nature of the study (Ethics Committee: Hospital Israelita
Albert Einstein - Sao Paulo – Brazil; Approval Number: 37516814.3.0000.0071). The clinical

Istanbul as outlined in the “Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant
Tourism”.
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 155 adult recipients [male: female 99:56; median age 53.1 (45.0 – 60.3) years] were
included in our study. Of the patients, 43 (27.7%) had pre-transplant diabetes mellitus, and 32
(20.6%) had pre-transplant hypertension; viral hepatitis was the cause of liver disease for 62
(40.0%). The median MELD score was 27 (22-35). Overall, 47 (31.5%) patients had Scr
levels > 1.5 mg/dL or were on HD at the time of listing, and 78 (50.4%) patients had Scr
levels > 1.5 mg/dL or were on HD at the time of OLT. Twenty-six patients (16.8%) needed
early re-OLT: 20 (77%) for primary nonfunction, 5 (19%) for hepatic artery thrombosis and 1
(4%) for hyperacute rejection. Twenty-eight patients (18.1%) had a history of hepatocellular
carcinoma. Of the patients, 21 (13.5%) underwent pre-OLT CRRT, 38 (24.5%) underwent pre￾OLT intermittent HD and 63 (40.6%) underwent post-OLT CRRT (undergoing CRRT and
intermittent HD were not mutually exclusive). The median intraoperative transfusion volumes
were 2 (0-3) U packed red blood cells and 0 (0-5) U FFP; 22 (14.2%) and 47 (30.3%) of the
patients received intraoperative cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions, respectively. The
median length of ICU stay during transplant hospitalization was 7 (4-14) days. One hundred
nine (70.3%) patients did not undergo pre-OLT RRT, and 37 (23.9%) underwent  14 days

and 9 (5.8%) underwent > 14 days of pre-OLT RRT (Table 1). The median length of pre-OLT
RRT was 5 (2-11) days. Table 1 also shows the baseline characteristics of the stable patients
undergoing post-OLT RRT by renal function recovery status.
At 90 days post-OLT, 118 (76%) patients had been removed from dialysis, and 16 (10%)
patients had died while undergoing HD (Fig 1). At the one-year follow-up, a total of 129 (83%)
patients had been removed from dialysis, 19 (12%) patients had died while undergoing HD, 2
(1%) patients had subsequently received a kidney transplant, and only 5 (3%) patients were
currently undergoing HD. The median recovery time of the post-OLT patients was 33 (27–39)
days. For the patients whose renal function recovered, 225 days was the longest duration of
HD.
Risk factors for renal function recovery
Univariate Cox regression analyses revealed that age; etiology of liver disease; pre-OLT hyper￾tension status; Scr level > 1.5 mg/dL or undergoing RRT at the time of transplant; transfusion
of intraoperative packed red blood cells, FFP and intraoperative platelets; undergoing pre￾OLT intermittent HD and post-OLT CRRT; and the duration of pre-OLT RRT were important
predictors of renal function recovery (Table 2). These variables were included in a multivariate
model.
In the multivariate analysis, fulminant hepatic failure as the cause of liver disease (HR =
3.39, 95% CI = 1.81 to 6.35, p < 0.001); the absence of pre-OLT hypertension (HR = 1.82, 95%
CI = 1.12 to 2.96, p = 0.016); lower intraoperative FFP transfusion volume (HR = 0.94, 95%
CI = 0.89 to 0.99, p = 0.019) and not undergoing pre-OLT intermittent HD (HR = 1.68, 95%
CI = 1.05 to 2.7, p = 0.032) were associated with performing RRT for less than 90 days. Not
undergoing post-OLT CRRT was also a marginally significant predictor of removal from dialy￾sis (HR = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.95 to 2.14, p = 0.088; Table 3).
Discussion
Renal failure in cirrhotic patients is a challenging complication with a significant impact on
mortality both before and after OLT [6, 7]. As the Scr level is a component of the MELD score,
the number of patients with renal dysfunction who undergo OLT and the proportion of OLTs
performed in combination with kidney transplants have increased [8, 9]. Patients with normal
or mild impairment of renal function pre-OLT whose status deteriorates during the periopera￾tive period may need RRT. A key point of this scenario is that it is important to determine the
nature of renal dysfunction and anticipate whether kidney function could recover after post￾OLT liver function recovery. In the present study, we evaluated 155 stable post-OLT patients
who did not have chronic irreversible renal disease diagnosed preoperatively and required
RRT (HD) post-intensive care hospitalization. Our objective was to describe the average time
to renal recovery and identity the factors associated with remaining on RRT > 90 days after
OLT among patients undergoing RRT. We observed that at 90 days post-OLT, 21 patients
(14%) were undergoing RRT, and after 1 year, only 5 (3%) remained on dialysis. The propor￾tion of patients in our study who recovered renal function was higher than that observed in a
previous, larger study [4].
We did not aim to investigate the incidence of post-OLT RRT in our center, as we did not
evaluate patients who required RRT in the intensive care unit environment post-OLT. Many
of those critical patients underwent continuous dialysis modalities and might have had an
increased risk of mortality. Our focus was on patients who were stable on dialysis and no lon￾ger needed intensive care but had an undetermined renal function prognosis. Age; etiology of

pre-OLT hypertension; lower intraoperative FFP transfusion volume; and not undergoing pre￾OLT intermittent HD were associated with performing RRT for less than 90 days.
A previous study found that the duration of renal dysfunction pre-OLT (defined as Scr
level  1.5 mg/dL) was correlated with creatinine elevation 6 and 12 months following liver
transplantation [10]. Similar results have been found among patients with kidney dysfunction
for more than 12 weeks prior to OLT (pretransplant Scr level  2 mg/dL); in a previous study,
these patients had increased risk of poor post-transplant renal outcomes (estimated glomerular
filtration rate  20 mL/minute within 3 years post-transplant) [11]. Our data are in accordance
with a study that evaluated 1041 liver transplant recipients who were on RRT at the time of
OLT. In this study, 707 recipients (67.9%) had spontaneous recovery of renal function after
liver transplantation, and those who recovered spontaneously had a significantly shorter
course of RRT during the pre-transplant period (15.6 versus 36.6 days, p < 0.001) [4]. Simi￾larly, Sharma et al. found that among surviving recipients who underwent acute RRT before
OLT without subsequent kidney transplant, the majority recovered renal function within 6
months, and longer pre-OLT RRT duration was significantly associated with increased risk of
renal nonrecovery (HR = 1.04 per day, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.05, p < 0.001) [12].
Fulminant hepatic failure is defined as the rapid development of acute liver injury with
severe impairment of synthetic function and hepatic encephalopathy in a patient without obvi￾ous previous liver disease [13]. AKI is common in patients with fulminant hepatic failure.
Based on a retrospective analysis of data from 1604 patients with acute liver failure, Tujius
et al. found that 70% developed AKI, 30% received RRT, and, in accordance with previous
reports, outcomes were negatively affected by AKI [14, 15]. The need for RRT has also been
identified as an independent prognostic factor of poor outcomes after OLT for fulminant
hepatic failure [16]. Conversely, Leithead et al. did not find an association between periopera￾tive AKI or RRT and chronic kidney disease in patients who received transplants due to acute
liver failure [17]. They proposed that the failure of perioperative renal dysfunction to impact
long-term posttransplant renal outcomes in patients with acute liver failure could reflect the
duration of renal impairment as the duration of renal dysfunction appears to be a key determi￾nant of chronic renal impairment in patients who receive transplants due to chronic liver dis￾ease [10, 17]. Nevertheless, it was observed that patients with fulminant hepatic failure and

AKI rarely developed chronic kidney disease, which corroborates our finding that fulminant
hepatic failure is a predictor of the need for RRT < 90 days after OLT [14].
Intraoperative blood transfusion is known to affect postoperative renal outcomes in OLT
patients [18–20]. A biologically plausible explanation for this association is that kidney hypo￾perfusion secondary to intraoperative bleeding represents an additional renal insult in patients
with pre-OLT AKI. In fact, Sirivatanauksorn et al. retrospectively observed that prolonged
intraoperative hypotension and postoperative hypotension were independent risk factors for
AKI after OLT [21]. Therefore, bleeding secondary to intraoperative coagulopathy could have
contributed to our finding that the need for FFP transfusion was negatively associated with
post-OLT recovery of renal function.
According to our data, pre-OLT hypertension was also associated with a higher probability
of remaining on dialysis > 90 days post-OLT. Rueggeberg et al. observed that pretransplant
hypertension was a risk factor for AKI after OLT [18]. Although we did not perform pre-OLT
kidney biopsies to provide histological evidence of the degree of associated hypertensive
nephrosclerosis in this subgroup of patients, it was not surprising that a classic risk factor for
chronic kidney disease in the general population could also impact patients with subsequent
AKI, as a similar association was previously observed in diabetic patients who underwent OLT
[11, 12].
A previous study found that among patients who developed end-stage renal disease after
OLT, only 27% who underwent HD were alive 6 years after the onset of renal failure; this find￾ing is substantially lower than the 71.4% survival rate among those who subsequently received a
kidney transplant [22]. Likewise, a Canadian registry study found significantly decreased sur￾vival in post-OLT patients who underwent RRT compared with matched nontransplant chronic
dialysis control patients, with 5-year patient survival rates of 17% and 43% for the post-OLT
patients and controls, respectively (p = 0.01) [23]. Thus, given the increasing frequency of renal
transplant referrals for recipients of nonrenal solid-organ transplants [24], two decisions must
be made: the appropriate time to list OLT patients undergoing RRT for a subsequent kidney
transplant and whether they should be prioritized for kidney transplantation.
There is concern that recipients of OLT alone who undergo RRT may prematurely be con￾sidered part of the group of patients with end-stage renal disease who need subsequent kidney
transplantation. This approach could compromise the pool of renal organs for those with end￾stage renal disease alone. Percutaneous renal biopsy may be helpful for determining the thera￾peutic strategy in patients with liver function improvement and lower risk of bleeding. Accord￾ing to the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) definition of AKI,
end-stage renal disease is the complete loss of kidney function (i.e., need for RRT) for more
than 3 months [25]. Based on this criterion, the renal transplant community is authorized to list
postoperative OLT patients for kidney transplantation after 3 months of RRT. In fact, according
to a previous report, within a year of transplant, a small percentage of OLT patients had already
undergone subsequent kidney transplantation [26]. However, how long after liver transplanta￾tion should kidney transplantation be performed? Hepatorenal syndrome, which is thought to
be reversible with OLT alone, may contribute to the requirement for long-term RRT post-trans￾plant. A previous study indicated that among 2112 adult deceased-donor OLT recipients who
received acute RRT for  90 days pre-OLT, a nonrecovery rate of only 8.9% was observed
among those who survived 6 months following OLT [12]. In contrast, in a series of 130 patients
with hepatorenal syndrome who underwent OLT, 7 (6%) were found to have developed irre￾versible kidney failure post-transplant, and 5 died within 1 year [27]. Based on these unfavorable
results, the authors recommend a minimum 60-day waiting period prior to considering subse￾quent kidney transplantation, regardless of donor type [27]. Nevertheless, our data suggest a
longer period may be appropriate before adding a patient to the kidney transplant list to assure

opportune kidney allocation, and a minimum 3-month waiting period is suggested; this
approach may be particularly appropriate for patients who have had a diagnosis of fulminant
hepatic failure, had no pre-OLT hypertension, received a lower transfused volume of intrao￾perative FFP and did not undergo pre-OLT intermittent HD. Our data provide practical infor￾mation for transplant doctors that allows them to stratify patients in terms of the factors
predicting whether they will no longer need RRT.
