Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a
myocardial disease, often familial, that is characterised
pathologically by fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular
myocardium, and clinically by ventricular arrhythmias of right
ventricular origin which may lead to sudden death, mostly in young
people and athletes.1-5 The term “dysplasia” was originally used to
describe an entity that was considered to be the result of a
developmental defect of the right ventricular myocardium.1 A
better understanding of clinical manifestations as well as
morphologic findings does not support the theory of a congenital
absence of the myocardium, but is in keeping with a non-ischaemic,
ongoing atrophy of the right ventricular myocardium, most likely
genetically determined, which becomes symptomatic in adolescents
and young adults.2-4 On the basis of its nature of progressive heart
muscle disease of unknown aetiology, ARVC has been more
appropriately included among the cardiomyopathies in the recent
classification proposed by the task force of the World Health
Organization/International Society and Federation of Cardiology.
Although several theories have been advanced, the
aetiopathogenesis of ARVC is still unknown.5
Pathologic features
The most striking pathologic feature of ARVC is the diffuse or
segmental loss of the myocardium of the right ventricular free wall


and its replacement by fibrofatty tissue (fig 1); it is frequently
transmural and accounts for aneurysmal dilations of the
diaphragmatic, apical, and infundibular regions (so called “triangle
of dysplasia”) in nearly 50% of the cases in the necropsy series.2-4
A wave front progression of the pathological process occurs from
the subepicardium to the endocardium, so that residual
myocardium is confined to the inner subendocardial layer and to
the trabeculae of the right ventricle, where islands of surviving
myocardial cells are scattered throughout the fibrofatty tissue.
Patchy acute myocarditis with myocyte death and round cell
(mostly T lymphocytes) inflammatory infiltrates …
