Abstract
We have developed an ontology to provide standardized nomenclature for anatomical terms in the
postnatal mouse. The Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary is structured as a directed acyclic graph,
and is organized hierarchically both spatially and functionally. The ontology will be used to annotate
and integrate different types of data pertinent to anatomy, such as gene expression patterns and
phenotype information, which will contribute to an integrated description of biological phenomena
in the mouse.
Rationale
An important role for biological databases is the integration
of different types of data. Ontologies aim to overcome the
semantic differences encountered in data collection and rep￾resentation, providing common terminology in order to facil￾itate this integration. An anatomy ontology is a structured
vocabulary of anatomical entities in which the terms have
unique identities and relate to each other in meaningful ways.
For many biological applications, anatomy ontologies are
essential for standardized description of data directly related
to anatomy, such as gene expression patterns and phenotype
information.
The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is a resource for gene
expression information from the mouse [1]. GXD has been
designed as an open-ended system able to store and integrate
primary data from many types of expression assays, each of
which describe gene expression at different levels of spatial
resolution. Currently, both GXD and the Edinburgh Mouse
Atlas Gene Expression (EMAGE) database [2] use terms from
the Mouse Embryo Anatomy Nomenclature Database [3]
developed by the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP) to
describe patterns of gene expression in the developing mouse.
However, since GXD also collects gene expression data from
mice at postnatal stages, including adult, it became apparent
that extension of GXD to fully annotate expression data for
adult structures would require the development of a control￾led vocabulary beyond the scope of the embryonic mouse
anatomy ontology. Therefore, we developed an anatomy
ontology for the postnatal mouse.
Critical to this effort was the realization that existing sources
of controlled vocabularies for anatomy were not sufficient for
use with the adult mouse, for several reasons. First, none con￾forms well to the structure of the embryonic mouse anatomy
ontology created by our Edinburgh collaborators, an impor￾tant factor in enabling planned integration between these
ontologies (see below). Human-oriented anatomical ontolo￾gies have been developed (for example, the Foundational
Model of Anatomy (FMA) [4], OpenGalen [5] and SNOMED

CT [6], which covers human and veterinary medicine). In
general, the complexity of the concepts represented by these
ontologies, issues concerning their accessibility, as well as
questions of relevance to the mouse, made it clear that they
were neither well suited to nor adequate for our objectives.
Thus, one of our goals was to follow the basic framework of
the developmental ontology, while taking full advantage of
the range of other resources available.
Another major consideration involved determination of the
hierarchical structure and format of the ontology. Our experi￾ence using the developmental ontology made it clear that a
mechanism to provide alternative hierarchies would be a crit￾ical factor. Consequently, the Adult Mouse Anatomical Dic￾tionary is structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in
which an anatomical term can be represented as a child of
more than one hierarchical parent term using both is-a and
part-of relationships. The ontology is organized hierarchi￾cally in both spatial and functional ways, and contains more
than 2,400 unique anatomical terms for the postnatal mouse.
As GXD is part of the larger Mouse Genome Informatics
(MGI) system, the ontology will also be used to annotate other
types of data pertinent to adult mouse anatomy in order to
provide an integrated description of a wide array of biological
phenomena in the mouse.
Developing an ontology for adult mouse 
anatomy
Anatomical terms
GXD has extensive experience with the Mouse Embryo Anat￾omy Nomenclature Database, available through Theiler Stage
(TS) 26, which is used by GXD and EMAGE to describe devel￾opmental gene expression patterns. Based on our annotation
work, we continue to contribute to this ontology in the form
of extensions and revisions, and by adding synonyms. Conse￾quently, an early objective was to ensure that the anatomy
ontology for the postnatal (TS 28) mouse corresponds as
much as possible, both in content and in structure, with the
developmental ontology. This was done for consistency of
nomenclature, because we were familiar with and confident
of the utility of this format, and to facilitate the future integra￾tion of these ontologies. Eventually, the goal is to combine
and integrate the ontologies to generate an anatomy ontology
covering the entire lifespan of the laboratory mouse.
With the developmental ontology as its framework, the effort
was then focused on compiling an extensive list of anatomical
terms for the postnatal mouse. The list was based on a
number of major sources, including mouse atlases as well as
anatomy and histology text resources [7-22]. For the most
part, the preference was to focus on those that were mouse￾specific. However, others that were more general were never￾theless extremely valuable. The non-atlas format references
were especially useful in the effort to refine anatomic and his￾tological details.
Once the basic list of terms had been generated, we confirmed
that each term on the initial list represented actual mouse
structures. These determinations were usually clear but at
times ambiguous. For example, for numerous structures
described in anatomy and histology textbooks, no clear docu￾mented evidence was found for their existence in the mouse.
Consequently, these have not been included in the ontology.
Further work is ongoing to ensure accuracy. Careful attention
was paid to validating each term, with the requirement for
two or more reliable sources whenever possible. Concurrent
with the textbook-based identification of terms was the con￾tinuing effort to expand the vocabulary using a research data￾driven approach. This method included extensive evaluation
of published biomedical research literature, as well as data
with anatomical attributes that have been collected in scien￾tific databases. For example, several mouse-specific datasets
[23-26] were used as resources to find pertinent anatomical
terms. The MGI list of all mouse tissues from which major
publicly available cDNA libraries have been generated [24]
includes cell types and tumors, as well as gross anatomical
concepts. The relevant anatomical structures will eventually
be translated using terms from the Adult Mouse Anatomical
Dictionary. The data-driven approach was especially useful in
determining the level of granularity (that is, level of detail of
spatial resolution) expected to be required by users of the
ontology.
An additional consideration in determining the content of the
vocabulary had to do with whether to include cell types. While
cell type information is an important component in anatomi￾cal descriptions, this also introduces a level of complexity that
is difficult to address adequately. We felt that it would be
unfeasible to extend the representation to the cellular level
owing to the large number of required hierarchical levels and
leaf nodes. Therefore, it was concluded that the adult mouse
anatomy ontology would not contain cell types, but that cell
type terms would eventually be provided by the orthogonal
controlled vocabulary for cell types currently being developed
as part of the Open Biological Ontologies (OBO) effort [27].
However, to conform to the Edinburgh developmental ontol￾ogy, we have included tissue type terms such as epithelium
and mesenchyme, as well as defined cell type structures such
as purkinje cell layer. In addition, we have also elected to
include the term unfertilized egg and its synonyms.
Hierarchical organization
The anatomy ontology for mouse development is currently
structured as a straight hierarchy. In this format, an anatom￾ical term can have only one parent and, thus, one place in the
hierarchy. For example, the term femur is placed in the hier￾archy according to this limb bone's spatial location, as a sub￾structure of the upper leg, rather than as a part of the
skeleton. In contrast, the brain is described as being part of
the central nervous system, rather than as a part of the head.
Based on our experience with the developmental ontology
and anticipating planned revisions for it, we decided to

represent the adult mouse anatomy ontology as a DAG, in
which a given anatomical term is able to have more than one
hierarchical parent. This allowed us flexibility in organizing
the hierarchies, and provided a mechanism to create a more
comprehensive view of the relationships between the ana￾tomical terms.
For each of the anatomical terms being evaluated, any one of
a number of pathways to that term could be conceptualized.
However, it also soon became apparent that two fundamental
characteristics could be determined for most of the terms: its
spatial location within the animal and its functional contribu￾tion as part of a particular organ system. Consequently, we
decided to use the distinction between spatial versus organ
system representation as an organizational principle. Since
'spatial part' does not itself represent a unique anatomical
entity, it was not included as an independent node in the
ontology. However, the initial division of the hierarchy into
spatial and organ system components is immediately appar￾ent in the first level of substructures below the root node,
TS28. As shown in Figure 1, this level is predominantly com￾prised of spatial parts: for example body, body cavity/lining,
head/neck, limb and tail. Accordingly, terms defined by these
superstructures are primarily organized according to spatial
localization. In contrast, another branch of the hierarchy is
indicated by the superstructure organ system, where the ana￾tomical terms are organized, as much as possible, according
to their respective contribution to a specified functional
system.
Currently, the distinction between spatial and functional rela￾tionships is represented only implicitly. However, based on
the parentage of anatomical structures, biologists will be able
to intuitively discern both types of relationships. Further￾more, they should be able to perform most of the queries
related to expression and phenotype data that are currently
envisioned. Explicit representation of both relationship types
might be a desirable feature for advanced knowledge repre￾sentation and computational analysis. On the other hand, it
might also introduce unnecessary complexities to a biologist
because, for example, many anatomical structures would
have both spatial and functional relationships between them.
Shielding the user from those complexities would require
additional software development. A careful evaluation of the
advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will direct
our future work in this area.
During the construction of the adult mouse anatomy DAG, we
had to take into account the fact that terms representing some
tissues would logically be spatially located in numerous parts
of the ontology. Groups of tissues which meet this criteria
include: blood vessel, bone, connective tissue, muscle, nerve,

organ and skin, which are represented as terms in the organ
system part of the hierarchy. To accommodate the need to
represent these tissues in specific body regions, we devised
modules (outlined as blocks in Figure 1) representing these
generic groups. These have been included as subterms, when
appropriate, within each spatial region. For nomenclature
standardization (more on this below), the subgroup terms are
preceded by superstructure name, in noun form (that is,
abdomen) rather than as an adjective (for example, abdomi￾nal) whenever possible.
Consequently, using the DAG format, we have been able to
describe adult mouse anatomy from a variety of spatial and
organ system perspectives. For example, the heart (Figure 2)
is represented as a type of thoracic cavity organ, as well as a
substructure of the cardiovascular system. As will be dis￾cussed below, some of these distinctions are conceptual and
by their nature may be somewhat arbitrary. However, from
our annotation work we know that the different breakdowns
of the anatomy are indeed required to annotate, for example,
different types of expression and phenotype data. It should be
emphasized that refinements to the hierarchical organization
of the ontology will continue to be made. These changes will
not affect the identity of the terms themselves.
Another issue in constructing the DAG was the use of is-a and
part-of relationships between the terms. Overall, most of the
relationships could be classified intuitively as part-of, indi￾cating that the term is a component of the more general term
above it in the tree. For example, the upper body is consid￾ered to be part-of the body, and the heart is part-of the car￾diovascular system. In contrast, is-a relationships are used to
indicate that an anatomical term represents an instance of the
certain type or kind of the concept denoted by its parent term.
For instance, the cardiovascular system is-a specific organ
system, while cardiac muscle is-a type of muscle. It should be
noted that there is no correlation between the is-a and part￾of relationships and the spatial versus organ system organi￾zation of the ontology, as shown in Figure 2. Further
refinement of the relationships will undoubtedly be required,

as well as additional types of relationships. For example, it
may be useful to distinguish between 'regional' parts (for
instance, head, neck, limb) versus 'systemic' parts (for
instance, body muscle, body organ, body skin). These modifi￾cations can be easily accomplished using the DAG-Edit tool
(see Software section below).
Nomenclature considerations
Our experience with the mouse developmental ontology, as
well as extensive literature review, provided the primary basis
for the naming conventions that were employed. Early in
building the ontology, we realized that consistent nomencla￾ture, not only for a given term itself but for related terms and
groups of terms, would be a critical requirement. Conse￾quently, whenever possible, the same name was used for a
given anatomical structure or concept throughout the ontol￾ogy. For instance, we have used the term lung rather than
'pulmonary' to precede each of the terms representing lung
substructures. Another consideration regarded the need to
clearly distinguish between terms. It is theoretically possible
to precisely define an anatomical term based on a combina￾tion of the term name and the hierarchical lineage of the term.
The term epithelium, for example, is represented as a sub￾term for many anatomical structures, and a given term's
precise identity could be defined by its parental lineage. From
a practical standpoint, this convention has proved to be prob￾lematic; multiple structures with the same term name would
be impossible to distinguish in absence of its hierarchical con￾text. This would be complicated further by any additional
pathway to a given term. For instance, epithelium of the lung
alveoli is represented both as a part of the alveolus and as a
type of lung epithelium. To address this issue, we have
attempted to provide sufficient information in the term name
(for example alveolus epithelium) so that it becomes easy to
interpret and use the term unambiguously.
Other factors that were considered were the requirements of
the DAG-Edit software (see below), as well as features pro￾moting unambiguous identification of terms. Additional con￾ventions employed for the naming of anatomical terms
included: structure names are preceded by superstructure
names, in noun form; terms are used in singular form, when￾ever possible; all term names at the same level in the hierar￾chy are ordered alpha-numerically; and all characters are in
lower case. Nomenclature consistency will also facilitate que￾rying for specific anatomical terms within the ontology.
Software issues
An ontology should contain a level of detail appropriate to the
data being classified and the level at which queries are likely
to be performed, while simultaneously providing sufficient
flexibility to enable regular updating without needing to sig￾nificantly modify the hierarchies. Therefore, we recognized
that the adult mouse anatomy ontology would require a for￾mat that was both robust and flexible, as well as the tools to
accommodate the need for maintenance and updating. The
DAG-Edit tool developed by the Gene Ontology (GO) Consor￾tium provides a graphical interface to handle any vocabulary
that has a DAG data structure, and has been used by other
groups to build ontologies for a wide range of biological sub￾jects, including the GO [28] and Mammalian Phenotype
ontology [29]. We have utilized DAG-Edit both for construc￾tion of the adult mouse anatomy ontology and for mainte￾nance and editing. Furthermore, the MGI software group has
developed a range of tools to handle a DAG-formatted ontol￾ogy, enabling navigation through the ontology and querying
for terms (see below), as well as integration of the ontology
with other information stored within the MGI database.
Current status and future directions for the 
Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary
We have developed an ontology containing more than 2,400
unique terms to provide standardized nomenclature for ana￾tomical structures in the postnatal mouse. The Adult Mouse
Anatomical Dictionary can be accessed at the MGI web site
[30]. The MGI Browser page (Figure 3) enables one to navi￾gate through the ontology in two ways. Browsing results in the
display of progressively lower levels in the hierarchy. Infor￾mation about individual terms, including its relationship to
other terms in the hierarchy, is shown in a 'Term Detail' page.
Alternatively, one can search the ontology by using the
'Query' field, which accepts any text string and searches for all
terms in the vocabulary, including any synonyms, containing
that string. The resulting 'Query Results' page displays all
structures that match the query, and also provides links to the
appropriate 'Term Detail' page. The adult mouse anatomy
ontology can also be viewed and downloaded at the OBO web￾site [31]. The ontology can be saved in several different for￾mats including GO flat file and OBO formats, as well as XML/
RDF and OWL.
We will continue to expand and refine the Adult Mouse Ana￾tomical Dictionary in response to additional sources of infor￾mation, as well as the needs of the scientific community. As
part of the ontology's ongoing development, we plan to:
expand the list of terms, based on additional resources as they
become available; further edit the hierarchies when neces￾sary; and provide alternative names for terms as synonyms. A
limited number of synonyms have already been included (for
example, see 'Term Detail' page for limb in Figure 3). It is
envisioned that many more will be added as required, which
will also aid in querying for specific terms in the ontology.
Precise definitions for each of the terms will also be included
as appropriate. Eventually, the adult mouse anatomy ontol￾ogy will be merged with the Anatomical Dictionary for Mouse
Development to generate an anatomy ontology covering the
entire lifespan of the laboratory mouse. The proposed effort
will include representation of derived-from types of relation￾ships linking anatomical structures at subsequent develop￾mental stages. Such relationships will allow querying for
progenitor and derivative tissues. These associations will also

enable analysis of differentiation pathways, thus enhancing
the ability to explore biological phenomena occurring in the
mouse.
Anatomy vocabularies are being developed for other organ￾isms and there has been interest in integrating these ontolo￾gies at some level. One such effort is the XSPAN project [32],
which aims to support cross-species interoperability between
developmental anatomy ontologies. On a different scale,
Standards and Ontologies for Functional Genomics (SOFG)
[33] has set up an international effort to integrate anatomy
ontologies of mouse and human. A recent project has been
development of the SOFG Anatomy Entry List (SAEL) [34], a
list of commonly used anatomical terms that will be directly
linked to several major anatomy ontologies, particularly
those for human and mouse. It is envisioned that this list will
serve as a controlled vocabulary to describe low-resolution
anatomical attributes of biological data. For example, the
terms included have sufficient resolution to distinguish most
samples used for microarray experiments. The Microarray
Gene Expression Data (MGED) ontology will use the SAEL
for describing anatomical attributes of mouse microarray
data. The SAEL and the MGED ontology will also serve as
entry points to more comprehensive anatomical resources
such as the Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary.
The Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary will be used as a
resource to enable standardization and integration of many
types of biological data pertinent to postnatal mouse anat￾omy, including expression, biological process, phenotype and
pathology data. GXD currently uses terms from the ontology
to annotate expression information at all postnatal stages.
While expression results are currently annotated using an
abridged version, efforts are underway to map expression
data directly to the expanded adult mouse anatomy ontology.
GO project curators use terms from the anatomy ontology to
describe mouse anatomical concepts. The Mouse Genome
Database (MGD) incorporates or associates relevant terms
from the adult anatomy ontology into the Mammalian Pheno￾type Ontology, which is being developed to provide standard
terms for annotating mouse phenotype data. Eventually, the
standardized anatomy terms will be used to directly link gene
expression and phenotype annotations within MGI via the
anatomy. The mouse anatomy ontology is also being used to

annotate phenotype data for the Eumorphia project [35]. In
Pathbase, a database of mutant mouse pathology [36], ana￾tomical attributes of images for mutant postnatal mouse
pathology are coded using terms based on the Adult Mouse
Anatomical Dictionary. Furthermore, efforts are currently
underway to incorporate the adult mouse anatomy ontology
into the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus, a knowl￾edgebase containing the working vocabularies used in NCI
data systems [37].
Anatomy is an important biological integrator. Like expres￾sion data, many biological processes and phenotypic observa￾tions relate to specific anatomical structures. We have
successfully promoted the idea that such data should be
described using the same anatomical descriptors. Specifi￾cally, we have shown that this can be achieved by describing
more complex types of biological information in a modular
fashion by combining terms from orthogonal vocabularies
[38]. The combinatorial approach takes advantage of existing
terms and relationships in the base ontologies. This approach
is now being used by most of the resources and projects men￾tioned above. The use of common anatomical terms will allow
for a direct integration of expression, biological process and
phenotypic data in the mouse. Links provided with the anat￾omy terms will, for example, allow display of both expression
data and phenotype information associated with specific ana￾tomical structures in the anatomical dictionary browser, as is
already the case for developmental expression data [23]. Fur￾thermore, this type of integration will enable complex queries
that directly correlate expression and phenotype data. For
example, the system will allow queries such as "Which mouse
mutants display phenotypes in a specific anatomical struc￾ture?" and "How does gene expression in this anatomical
structure, or in precursors of this anatomical structure, differ
between these mutants and wild type animals?" Answers to
these types of queries hold the promise of providing direct
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying differen￾tiation and disease.
