Abstract
Endothelins (ET) and prostaglandin E2 are synthesized in
the inner medulla by collecting duct epithelium and intersti￾tial cells, respectively. All ascending vasa recta (AVR) blood
returns from the inner medulla to the cortex in outer medul￾lary vascular bundles. We reasoned that hormones might
influence medullary blood flow by diffusing across AVR
fenestrations to modulate vasoconstriction of outer medul￾lary descending vasa recta (OMDVR). To investigate this
possibility, OMDVR dissected from vascular bundles were
exposed to ET-1, 2, or 3. Each endothelin isoform induced
stable vasoconstriction with potency, ET-1 > ET-2 > ET-3
(EC5, 1.8 x 10-15, 5.9 x 10-12, and 8.8 x 10-10 M, respec￾tively). The ETA receptor antagonists BQ-123 and BQ-610
(10-6 M), as well as an ETA and ETB receptor antagonist
combination, attenuated vasoconstriction due to ET-1 (10-12
M). BQ-123 had no effect on the response to ET-3 (10-
M). The ETB receptor antagonist BQ-788 (10-6 M) attenu￾ated the response to ET-3 (1010 M), but not that to ET-1
(10-2 M). Finally, PGE2 (10-6 M) reversibly dilated
OMDVR preconstricted with ET-1 (1012 M) or ET-3 (10-8
M) but not ET-1 (1010 M). We conclude that ET-1, 2, and
3 are potent constrictors of OMDVR and the response to
ET-1 is mainly ETA receptor subtype mediated, while ET￾3 acts via the ETB. PGE2 modulates ET induced constriction.
These findings are consistent with interactive feedback and
control of medullary perfusion by locally synthesized hor￾mones. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:2734-2740.) Key words:

Introduction
Endothelins (ET)' are potent vasoactive peptides whose role
in the control of the systemic and renal microcirculations contin￾ues to be elucidated (1, 2). In their investigations of the sites
of endothelin production, Kitamura et al. found the renal me￾dulla to have the highest concentrations of endothelins (3).

Substantial evidence has shown that endothelins are synthesized
in the renal medulla. Production of ET-1 and, to a lesser extent,
ET-3 has been demonstrated in the collecting tubule (4-6). All
blood flow to the renal medulla is derived from the efferent
flow of juxtamedullary glomeruli (7) so that synthesis of endo￾thelins by glomerular endothelial, mesangial (8), or epithelial
cells (9) might also supply hormone to the medulla. Endothelins
are known to exert a variety of effects including mitogenesis
( 10), modulation of sodium transport ( 11 ) and vasoconstriction
(12). Additionally, ET stimulation of renal medullary intersti￾tial cells leads to production of the abundant medullary eicosa￾noid, PGE2 ( 13). PGE2 is a renal vasodilator the blockade of
which leads to diminution of medullary blood flow (14-16)
and potentiation of ET-1-induced renal vasoconstriction (1).
The unique anatomical arrangement of the vasa recta sug￾gests the existence of a feedback system for control of the
total and regional distribution of medullary blood flow. Outer
medullary descending vasa recta (OMDVR) are contractile mi￾crovessel segments (17, 18) that arise from efferent arterioles
ofjuxtamedullary glomeruli and subsequently traverse the inner
stripe of the outer medulla in tightly packed vascular bundles
(19). Remarkably, the ascending vasa recta (AVR) in the bun￾dles are only those which arise from the inner medulla. AVR
derived from reanastomosis of the capillary plexus in the outer
medullary interbundle region return to the cortex without re￾joining vascular bundles (19). Based on this anatomical ar￾rangement, we hypothesize that hormones (e.g., ET and PGE2)
produced in the inner medulla might modulate the contraction of
pericytes on the ablumenal surface of adjacent vascular bundle
descending vasa recta (DVR) by crossing the fenestrated AVR
wall (20). Detailed studies of the permselective properties of
AVR have not been performed, however, some experiments
have indicated that macromolecules much larger than endothel￾ins can gain access to the interstitium across AVR fenestrations
(21-23).
These considerations and the recent demonstration by poly￾merase chain reaction of the mRNA encoding the ETA and ETB
receptors in vascular bundles (24), have provided substantial
motivation to perform a detailed investigation of the effect of
the endothelin isoforms 1, 2, and 3 on OMDVR. These studies
demonstrate that ETs are remarkably potent vasoconstrictors.
Additionally, we have determined that PGE2 can antagonize the
effects of ET-1 and ET-3 in this important regulatory microves￾sel segment verifying that locally produced hormones can mod￾ulate OMDVR vasomotor tone.
Methods
In vitro microperfusion
Detailed descriptions of the methods employed to perfuse OMDVR
(17) and document their contractility (18) have been provided. The
method is a minor variation of that originally described by Burg (25)

medullary vascular bundles and perfused in vitro are exclusively
OMDVR and not AVR which are also present in vascular bundles ( 17).
In brief, young female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley,
Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
thiopental (50 mg/Kg) after which the kidneys were harvested, sliced
and placed into cold (40C) Hepes buffer (5 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl,
10 mM NaAcetate, 5 mM KC1, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.71 mM Na2HPO4,
0.29 mM NaH2HPO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Alanine, 5 mM Glucose,
and 0.5 g/dl Albumin, adjusted to pH 7.4 and bubbled with 100% 02).
Vasa recta were dissected from vascular bundles. The bundles were
located by progressively peeling medullary tissue from the corticomed￾ullary junction until vasa recta were encountered. Vasa recta are readily
identifiable by their small diameter and irregular wall structure. One or
two vessels were taken from each rat within 2 h of death.
The construction of pipettes has been described (17, 18). Holding
pipettes have outside diameters of 12-15 jum and inner constrictions
<9 jim. Perfusion pipettes have outside diameters of 6 jim. Collec￾tion pipettes were maintained in the range of 6-12 jim and interchanged
to achieve an acceptable fit to the OMDVR segment under study.
Harvested vessels were transferred to the stage of an inverted micro￾scope (Nikon diaphot) equipped with Differential Interference Contrast
(DIC, Nomarski) optics. After cannulation, vessels were perfused at
37°C with the same Hepes buffer used for dissection. The bath solution
was identical to the perfusate except for addition of hormones. The bath
flow rate was 300 1l/min, delivered by a syringe pump. The addition
of hormonal agents during experiments was achieved by three rapid
exchanges of the bath from a prewarmed syringe. Micromanipulators,
perfusion and collection apparatus and perfusion chamber were pur￾chased from Instruments Technology and Machinery (San Antonio,
TX). Temperature of the perfusion chamber was maintained at 37°C
with a feedback system employing a CN911 1A controller (Omega Engi￾neering Inc., Stamford, CT).
Following a 30-min equilibration period, perfusions were standard￾ized by the adjustment of collection rate to the desired value (5 nl/min
in most experiments). Timed collections of vessel effluent were obtained
with volumetric constriction pipettes after which collection rate was
adjusted by changing the pressure in the perfusion pipette. Driving
pressure, once adjusted to obtain 5 nl/min collection rate was maintained
constant throughout each experiment. Continuous measurement of lume￾nal pressure in the microperfused vessel has not been feasible, however,
we have performed separate experiments that show lumenal pressures
to be less than 15 mmHg (18).
Videomicroscopy and measurement of vessel diameters
To evaluate the effects of vasoactive agents on OMDVR diameters,
microperfusion experiments were recorded on video tape. The inverted
microscope was equipped with a 20/80% beam splitter and a side port
for attachment of a video camera (CCD model 72; Dage-MTI). During
experimentation, OMDVR were observed with a 40x objective to yield
a final magnification of 1,300 on the video screen. Experiments were
recorded on a Panasonic model AG 1960 VCR with a microphone for
audio recording of experimental events. During playback, vessel internal
diameters were measured by calipers at the point of greatest constriction
(following ET administration). This method has been demonstrated to
yield data indistinguishable from that obtained by more cumbersome
image analysis (18). Because of the sensitivity and intensity of the
vasopressor response to endothelins, the edge detection algorithm of
computer imaging software was, in many cases, unable to distinguish
lumenal edges during near 100% constriction. The focus of the micro￾scope and adjustment of the differential interference contrast optics were
optimized to yield maximal contrast to the vessel wall. In this study,
changes in vessel inner diameter are expressed as percent constriction,
defined in terms of the basal diameter in the absence of hormones (Do)
and the experimental diameter (D) by the expression, %Constriction
= (1 - D/Do) x 100.
Reagents
Endothelins 1, 2, and 3, BQ-123, BQ-610 and IRL-1038 were purchased
from Peninsula Laboratories. RES-701-1 was obtained from Alexis and
BQ-788 from American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA). Indometh￾acin was purchased from Sigma. Peptides (except IRL-1038, RES-701-
1, and BQ-788) were initially dissolved in deionized water. All pharma￾cological agents were solubilized and frozen at -20'C in small aliquots
of 10-'-10-5 M. Aliquots were thawed and diluted at least 1,000-fold
on the day of the experiment. Unused portions were discarded. PGE2
(Sigma) was dissolved in 100% ethanol and stored at -20'C at a con￾centration of 10-3M. IRL-1038 was solubilized in 40-0.1% trifluoro￾acetic acid and 60% acetonitrile; RES-701-1 was dissolved in 15%
DMSO and BQ-788 was dissolved in 100% methanol. Following
2 1,000-fold dilution of aliquots with buffer the solvents used did not
produce vasoactive effects themselves nor did they affect the actions of
added hormones.
Experimental protocol
Stability of OMDVR vasoconstriction by ET-J, 2, and 3. After cannula￾tion, OMDVR were perfused for 30 min for equilibration. Subsequently
ET-1, 2, or 3 (10 10 M) was added to the bath. Lumenal diameter
measurements were taken every minute for the first 5 min and every 5
min thereafter for an additional 30 min. At 30 min ET was removed
from the bath to observe recovery. After removal of hormone, recovery
diameter measurements were taken every minute for 5 min and again
at 10 min.
Concentration dependence of vasoconstriction by ET-J, 2, and 3.
Following equilibration, ET- 1, 2, or 3 was added to the bath in incremen￾tal concentrations. Due to their high potency ET-1 and ET-2 concentra￾tions were increased from 10-2° M to 10-8 M by 100-fold increments.
ET-3 was increased in the bath from 10-12 M to l0-7 M by 10-fold
increments. Based upon the results of experiment 1 (see Results), 10
min were permitted to elapse following concentration changes before
videorecording for diameter measurement.
The effects of transmural pressure on ET-1 potency in OMDVR
were examined by generating truncated dose-response curves (10-16 M
to 10-10 M) at differing collecting pressures (0 and 10 mmHg). Simi￾larly, the effect of bath and perfusate albumin concentration (0.5 or 4.0
g/dl) on ET-1 potency was examined. 10 min were allowed between
ET-1 concentration changes and measurements as previously described.
Albumin at 0.5 g/dl was used in all other experimental procedures.
Attenuation ofET-J and ET-3 induced vasoconstriction by ETA and
ETB receptor antagonists. To determine the contribution of the ETA
receptor subtype to the responses of ET-1 and ET-3 we utilized the
specific ETA receptor antagonists, BQ-123 and BQ-610. Following con￾trol measurements, either BQ-123 or BQ-610 (10-6 M) was added to
the bath for ten minutes to allow receptor binding and to determine
possible agonistic activity. Next, ET-l (10-12 M) or ET-3 (10-8 M)
was added to the bath in the presence of antagonist. Finally, the antago￾nist was removed from the bath leaving ET alone. As a time control,
changes in lumenal diameter in the absence of antagonists were also
documented.
Similar experiments were conducted to determine the contribution
of the ETB receptor to the vasoconstrictor responses of ET-1 and ET-3
(a selective ETB agonist). The ETB receptor antagonists IRL-1038 (10-5
M), RES-701-1 (10-6 M), and BQ-788 (10-6 M) were added sepa￾rately to the bath before and during the presence of ET-3 (10-8 M). In
addition, the ability of BQ-788 (10-6 M) to attenuate ET-l (10-10 M)
induced constriction was assessed alone and in conjunction with BQ￾123 (an ETA antagonist) in a manner similar to that used for other
antagonists. Control experiments were performed in the absence of an￾tagonist.
Modulating effects of PGE2 on ET-J- and ET-3-induced vasocon￾striction. 10 min after hormone addition, OMDVR constricted with
either ET-1 (10 10 M) or ET-3 (10-8 M) were videotaped for diameter
measurement. Subsequently, 0.1% ethanol (the vehicle for PGE2) was
added to the bath and recording was repeated after five minutes. Next,
PGE2 (10-6 M) was added in the presence of ET-l or ET-3. Diameters
were again measured. Finally, PGE2 and vehicle were removed from
the bath leaving ET alone. Diameters were recorded after 10 min.
Several laboratories have documented a lack of effect of PGE2 to

abrogate severe renal vasoconstriction induced by high concentrations
of ET-l. PGE2 has, however, been effective at submaximal concentra￾tions of ET-l (1). Based on those observations, we tested the effect of
PGE2 on OMDVR preconstricted with 101o M ET-l and 10-12 M
ET-1.
To address the possible role of endogenous basal release of prosta￾glandins and/or ET-l -stimulated prostaglandins in our preparation we
attempted to potentiate preexisting ET constriction (ET-l, 10-12 M) by
adding indomethacin (10-6 M) to the bath solution. To assure that time￾course of antagonist addition and prostaglandin halflife did not affect
the results of acute indomethacin addition to OMDVR, a separate group
of rats was injected with 5 mg/kg indomethacin (intraperitoneal) 30
min before i.p. sacrifice and subsequent exposure to ET-l (10-12 M).
Indomethacin (10-6 M) was also added to both the bath and perfusate.
These results were compared to those obtained from sham injected rats.
Statistical analysis
Experimental results are reported as mean±SE. Statistical comparisons
employ a paired t-test or repeated measures analysis of variance (AN￾OVA) as appropriate. For ANOVA, significance was determined by the
Student-Newman-Keuls test. P values of less than 0.05 are considered
significant.

however, focal constriction at only a few locations along the
vessel axis was equally common. Of the three isopeptides only
ET-3 was unable to completely obliterate the lumenal space at
maximally effective concentration.
Increasing collection pressure from 0 mmHg (n = 7) to 10
mmHg (n = 6) had no effect on the response of OMDVR to
ET-1 ( 10-16 M to 10 10 M). Increasing albumin concentration
from 0.5 to 4.0 g/dl (n = 7) was also without effect (Fig. 4).
Attenuation of ET-J- and ET-3-induced vasoconstriction

respectively), however, BQ-123 failed to attenuate the effect
of ET-3 (10-8 M, Fig. 6, n = 6, BQ-610 not tested). The ETB

was followed by recovery (+P < 0.05).
BQ-788 tended to attenuate ET-1 -induced constriction but the
decrease was not statistically significant (Fig. 5).
To verify the ability of the vessels to respond to ET-1 fol￾lowing effective blockade, antagonist(s) were subsequently re￾moved leaving ET-1 (10-10 M) in the bath. Following the re￾moval of antagonist(s), further ET-1 induced constriction oc￾curred (P < 0.05) but the recovery was not complete,
suggesting a high affinity of the antagonist (s) for the recep￾tor(s) (Fig. 5).
The ETB receptor antagonists IRL-1038 ( 10-5 M) and RES￾701-1 (10-6 M) as well as the ETA receptor antagonist, BQ￾123 (10-6 M) failed to attenuate the response to ET-3 (10-8
M, Fig. 6, n = 5, 6, and 6, respectively). In contrast, the ETB
receptor antagonist BQ-788 (10-6 M) significantly diminished
the ET-3 response (Fig. 6, n = 7). The antagonists did not alter
baseline diameters significantly when administered alone (Figs.
5 and 6).
Modulating effects of PGE2 on ET-J- and ET-3-induced
vasoconstriction. Ablumenal application of PGE2 (10-6 M) to
vessels preconstricted with ET-1 (10-10 M, n = 6) had no
vasodilatory effect (Fig. 7). However, vessels preconstricted
by a lesser concentration of ET-1 ( 10-12 M, n = 8) relaxed by
65% within 5 min of PGE2 application (P < 0.05, Fig. 7).
Vessels preconstricted with ET-3 (10-8 M, n = 9) were simi￾larly dilated (63%) in the presence of PGE2. Removal of PGE2
from the bath leaving ET-1 or ET-3 alone resulted in significant
recovery of constriction. PGE2 was added to the bath by 1,000-
fold dilution of 10-3 M stock dissolved in ethanol. Vehicle
alone (ethanol) had no effect on vessels preconstricted with
either ET-1 or ET-3 (Fig. 7).
Endothelin-1 (10-12 M) induced constriction was not al￾tered by the addition of indomethacin ( 10-6 M) to the bath (n
= 8, Fig. 8). Similarly, constriction was unaffected in OMDVR
of rats pretreated with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, n = 8) when
compared to diluent injected rats (n = 7, data not shown).

meruli. Aglomerular routes have largely been discounted (19).
In the outer stripe of the outer medulla, juxtamedullary efferent
arterioles give rise to OMDVR all of which traverse the inner
stripe in vascular bundles. Vascular bundles contain OMDVR,
AVR returning from the inner medulla and, depending upon
the species, the thin descending limbs of short looped nephrons
(19). Thus, OMDVR perfuse the entire medulla and are ex￾posed to AVR blood returning from the inner but not the outer
medulla of the kidney. OMDVR on the bundle periphery give
rise to the capillary plexus that perfuses nephron segments in
the outer medullary interbundle region of the inner stripe while
those in the bundle center cross the inner-outer medullary junc￾tion to supply the inner medulla (19, 26).
In the present context, two features of this microanatomical
arrangement are particularly relevant. First, endothelin pro￾duced in the inner medulla can reach pericytes on the ablumenal
surface of OMDVR by diffusing across the walls of AVR in
vascular bundles. Second, if radial variation of OMDVR respon￾siveness to endothelin exists within the bundles, endothelins
might play a role to determine the fraction of juxtamedullary
efferent flow that perfuses the outer vs inner medulla of the
kidney. An integral assumption is that the AVR wall is perme￾able to endothelin (mol wt = 2492). Detailed investigations
of AVR permselectivity have not been performed, however,
histochemical tracers as large as catalase and ferritin have been
observed to cross AVR fenestrations (22, 23) and the reflection
coefficient of AVR to albumin is less than 1.0 (21). ET-1 and
ET-3 produced by the inner medullary collecting duct probably
diffuses into adjacent inner medullary AVR plasma. Recently,
we found significant permeation of OMDVR by inulin (Pallone,
T. L., S. Nielsen, E. P. Silldorff, and S. Yang, manuscript sub￾mitted for publication) so that endothelins might also be ex￾pected to enter DVR plasma. Based upon these considerations
it seems reasonable to suggest that countercurrent exchange and
trapping of endothelin in the renal medulla could occur.
The generation of endothelins in the inner medulla may
exert diuretic and natriuretic effects through direct stimulation
of tubular cells ( 1). Additionally, endothelins stimulate medul￾lary interstitial cells to produce PGE2 (13), an autacoid which
has been shown to decrease sodium reabsorption by the thick
ascending limb of Henle (27) and the collecting tubule (28).
Figure 8. Lack of endogenous prostaglandin effects in ET-1 treated
OMDVR. Indomethacin (I) effects on ET-l-induced constriction and
PGE2 dilation were examined (open circles, n = 8) and compared to
untreated OMDVR (n = 7). Significant vasodilation (*P < 0.05) oc￾cuffed with PGE2, followed by recovery of constriction following re￾moval (+P < 0.05).
The ability of endothelins to constrict OMDVR might act to
abrogate these primary and secondary saluretic stimuli. In￾creases in renal perfusion pressure are known to induce natriure￾sis (termed pressure natriuresis). The detailed mechanisms re￾sponsible for pressure natriuresis have not been fully delineated.
However, based on results showing that increases in medullary
interstitial pressure and pressure natriuresis are jointly elimi￾nated by renal decapsulation (29), increases in vasa recta hy￾draulic pressure and medullary interstitial pressure appear to
be primary events. Through their ability to constrict OMDVR,
endothelins might blunt increases in medullary microcirculatory
and interstitial hydraulic pressure thus reducing the ability of
the kidney to undergo pressure natriuresis. The net effect on
renal sodium handling of the tubular and vascular actions of
endothelins is difficult to predict.
This is the first study to demonstrate that ET-1, 2, and
3 vasoconstrict outer medullary descending vasa recta
(OMDVR). In view of the critical location of these vessels and
the high production (1) and concentration of endothelins in the
renal medulla (3), pathophysiological implications may exist.
Brezis and colleagues have demonstrated that the highly meta￾bolic thick ascending limb of Henles loop is particularly vulner￾able to ischemic insult (30). The medullary portion of the thick
ascending limb of Henles loop resides in the interbundle region
of the outer medulla and is therefore supplied with nutrients and
oxygen by OMDVR on the vascular bundle periphery. Marked
vasoconstriction of those vessels by endothelins or other hor￾mones might play a role in the induction or exacerbation of
ischemic acute renal failure. In support of this hypothesis, Chan
et al. and Gellai et al. demonstrated abrogation of ischemic
acute renal failure in rats treated with the ETA receptor blocker,
BQ-123 (31, 32).
Recognizing this is the first study of the actions of endothel￾ins on OMDVR, we meticulously characterized the effect of
each isopeptide and the receptor subtypes which mediate vaso￾constriction. Maximal vasoconstriction occurs within minutes
after application of endothelins (Fig. 1) and these hormones
have a remarkable potency (threshold effect 1018 M, Fig. 2).
It should be recognized, however, that our observations with
the in vitro perfused OMDVR provides only a system for bioas￾say of concentration dependent hormonal effects on vasocon￾2738 Silldorif et al.

striction. As such, the intense vasoconstriction observed in vitro
might not exist in vivo even if local endothelin concentrations
are as high as those employed in our experiments. The absence
of modulating vasodilators probably accentuates the apparent
response in the in vitro perfused microvessel preparation.
The threshold concentrations capable of eliciting OMDVR
vasoconstriction in our preparation are well below typical
plasma levels of immunoreactive endothelins. This implies,
first, that endothelins could contribute significantly to basal
OMDVR vasomotor tone in vivo and, second, that modulating
endogenous vasodilators may play important roles to maintain
and modulate renal medullary perfusion. In support of this con￾cept, several authors (14-16) have shown that cyclooxygenase
inhibition diminishes medullary blood flow in vivo.
We demonstrated that ET-1, at least in part, acts on OMDVR
through stimulation of an ETA receptor subtype while ET-3
appears to act through the ETB receptor (Figs. 5 and 6). It is
generally accepted that ET-1 activates ETA or ETB while ET-3
action occurs by stimulation of ETB alone. The ETB receptor
subtype has been localized to the vascular endothelium where
it mediates the secretion of nitric oxide (33) and to smooth
muscle where it mediates vasoconstriction (12). The inability
to attenuate the response of ET-3 with either IRL-1038 or RES￾701-1 may indicate a lack of affinity or specificity of these
antagonists for the ETB receptor subtype in the rat (34).
Vasoconstriction of the renal microvasculature by endothel￾ins has previously been demonstrated by a number of authors.
Edwards et al. showed that rabbit efferent and afferent arterioles
constrict in response to ET-1 and ET-2 (ECm - 1 nM) while
ET-3 is significantly less potent (35). Similarly, in the hydrone￾phrotic rat kidney both efferent and afferent arterioles con￾stricted in response to topical or lumenal administration of ETs,
however, the afferent arteriole may be more sensitive (36-38).
Other investigators have demonstrated the ability of ET to al￾ter glomerular filtration rate and renal vascular resistance in
vivo (1).
Wilkes et al. demonstrated stimulation of PGE2 production
in renal medullary interstitial cells by ET-1, but not by ET-3
(13). This suggests the existence of a mechanism to modulate
the actions of ET through opposition by PGE2. In our studies,
PGE2 reversibly dilated OMDVR preconstricted with 1012 M
ET-1 or ET-3, but not 10 10 M ET-1. These results are consis￾tent with the finding that cyclooxygenase inhibition potentiates
mild to moderate, but not severe renal vasoconstriction induced
by ET-1 (1). The differing sensitivities of ET-1- and ET-3-
induced constriction to PGE2 might imply that the mechanism
of interaction between PGE2 and the cellular signal generated
by ET-1 and ET-3 are different. Our experiments using indo￾methacin in isolated OMDVR demonstrate that endogenous
cyclooxygenase products do not significantly affect the potency
of endothelin or that adequate substrate is lacking in this in
vitro perfused preparation.
In summary, this study provides the first description of vaso￾constriction of OMDVR by endothelins. All ET isopeptides are
extremely potent and induce stable vasoconstrictive responses.
The receptor mediating the response to ET-l is primarily ETA,
while the ET-3 response is generated via the ETB subtype. The
known stimulation of PGE2 production in the renal medulla by
ET-1 (13), coupled with the ability of PGE2 to modulate
OMDVR vasoconstriction by ET-1 or ET-3 suggests that a
system may exist for feedback regulation of medullary perfusion
by these autacoids. That feedback system might well be influ￾enced by other vasoactive agents that are present in the renal
medulla.
