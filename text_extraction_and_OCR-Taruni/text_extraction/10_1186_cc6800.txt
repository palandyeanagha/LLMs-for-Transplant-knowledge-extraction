Abstract
Introduction Blood glucose (BG) control performed by
intensive care unit (ICU) nurses is becoming standard practice
for critically ill patients. New (semi-automated) 'BG control'
algorithms (or 'insulin titration' algorithms) are under
development, but these require stringent validation before they
can replace the currently used algorithms. Existing methods for
objectively comparing different insulin titration algorithms show
weaknesses. In the current study, a new approach for
appropriately assessing the adequacy of different algorithms is
proposed.
Methods Two ICU patient populations (with different baseline
characteristics) were studied, both treated with a similar 'nurse￾driven' insulin titration algorithm targeting BG levels of 80 to
110 mg/dl. A new method for objectively evaluating BG
deviations from normoglycemia was founded on a smooth
penalty function. Next, the performance of this new evaluation
tool was compared with the current standard assessment
methods, on an individual as well as a population basis. Finally,
the impact of four selected parameters (the average BG
sampling frequency, the duration of algorithm application, the
severity of disease, and the type of illness) on the performance
of an insulin titration algorithm was determined by multiple
regression analysis.
Results The glycemic penalty index (GPI) was proposed as a
tool for assessing the overall glycemic control behavior in ICU
patients. The GPI of a patient is the average of all penalties that
are individually assigned to each measured BG value based on
the optimized smooth penalty function. The computation of this
index returns a number between 0 (no penalty) and 100 (the
highest penalty). For some patients, the assessment of the BG
control behavior using the traditional standard evaluation
methods was different from the evaluation with GPI. Two
parameters were found to have a significant impact on GPI: the
BG sampling frequency and the duration of algorithm
application. A higher BG sampling frequency and a longer
algorithm application duration resulted in an apparently better
performance, as indicated by a lower GPI.
Conclusion The GPI is an alternative method for evaluating the
performance of BG control algorithms. The blood glucose
sampling frequency and the duration of algorithm application
should be similar when comparing algorithms.
Introduction
Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically
ill patients (even those without diabetes mellitus [1-3]) and are
associated with adverse outcome in a variety of clinical set￾tings [4-7]. In two randomized controlled studies of mechani￾cally ventilated patients admitted to a surgical and a medical
intensive care unit (ICU), normalization of blood glucose (BG)
(between 80 and 110 mg/dl) with insulin significantly reduced
morbidity and mortality rates [8,9]. BG control, aiming at nor￾moglycemia, is now attempted in ICUs worldwide. This is usu￾ally performed by nurses or physicians who are instructed by
'manual' guidelines or algorithms [10-14]. These algorithms
BG = blood glucose; GPI = glycemic penalty index; HGI = hyperglycemic index; ICU: intensive care unit.

are developed with the purpose of determining the insulin
dose that is required to obtain normoglycemia based on inter￾mittent BG readings. Computer-based protocols (as pre￾sented in [15-27]) have the potential to facilitate and improve
glycemic control and to reduce the workload for medical staff.
However, these 'new' protocols require stringent validation
before they can replace the currently existing 'nurse-driven'
insulin protocols.
Three types of methods exist for evaluating the adequacy of
insulin titration algorithms. All of them, however, show weak￾nesses that may lead to erroneous conclusions. The first
method simply computes the average of all BG readings. In
spite of its popularity, it must be stressed that normoglycemia
can be falsely assumed even in the presence of severely
abnormal BG values. Indeed, hypoglycemic and hyperglyc￾emic events can artificially lower or raise, respectively, the cal￾culated average and can even balance each other, leading to
an apparently 'normal' average BG.
A second method comprises single measurements; for exam￾ple taking BG readings at a fixed time of day, the minimum/
maximum BG values, and the time needed to reach the target
BG. Alternative single measurements count the number of
hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events. Although such meas￾urements are useful, they do not capture the BG dynamics.
Recently, the hyperglycemic index (HGI) was presented as a
third, more advanced, tool for assessing glucose control (in
the ICU) with respect to hyperglycemic events [28]. The HGI
is defined as the area under the glucose curve above 6.0
mmol/l (108 mg/dl) divided by the length of ICU stay. Two
conditions to be satisfied before applying the HGI were pro￾posed [29]. First, the number of BG measurements should be
sufficiently high; ideally a near-continuous glucose read-out.
Second, the considered sampling frequency should be com￾parable in both patient groups when comparing the adequacy
of two insulin titration algorithms. It is important to note that
area-under-the-curve methods (such as the HGI) currently rely
on the assumed (linear) relationship between intermittent BG
readings, since no reliable and accurate near-continuous glu￾cose sensor is presently available [15,19,30].
Another critical point of this technique is that outliers can
potentially warp the obtained results due to the possible pres￾ence of extreme (hyperglycemic) observations that may have
an impact on the computed area-under-the-curve. This is an
important feature when realizing that sensor accuracy (and
reliability) typically decreases as the BG level increases [31-
33]. It is clear that the presence of outliers also affect the com￾puted average BG values (see Materials and methods). Finally,
HGI only transforms the hyperglycemic, and not the hypoglyc￾emic, glucose dynamics into a number. Of course, we
acknowledge that the design of an alternative hypoglycemic
index (as already suggested in [34]) would overcome this last
aspect.
The aim of the current study was to design a tool for adequate
comparison of BG control algorithms. In the first part of the
study, we developed a grading system that scores normal,
hypoglycemic, and hyperglycemic BG readings; the glycemic
penalty index (GPI). In the second part of the study, the per￾formance of the GPI was compared on an individual as well as
a population basis with the current standard evaluation meth￾ods (average morning BG, mean of all BG readings and HGI),
using data from a selected set of patients. In the third part of
the study, we investigated the importance or the weight of four
clinically selected parameters (BG sampling frequency, dura￾tion of algorithm application, severity of disease, and type of ill￾ness) on GPI.
Materials and methods
Mathematical computation of GPI
We defined the GPI as a tool that scores BG readings in order
to evaluate the overall BG dynamics obtained in the consid￾ered patient by applying a specific ICU insulin titration algo￾rithm. The computation of the GPI used a penalty strategy that
was based on clinical 'expert' knowledge. The glycemic target
range in the ICU was defined as 80 to 110 mg/dl [8,9], with a
penalty value for all BG values lying in this range, therefore set
at 0. Hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events were amplified
(in terms of the assigned penalties) in relation to the magni￾tude of their deviation from the target range. Table 1 gives an
overview of the glycemic threshold values that are generally
accepted for use in the ICU. Each glycemic range was associ￾ated with a penalty ρ leading to a staircase 'expert' penalty
function when considering the full glycemic range (see Figure
1, dashed line).
We then smoothed this staircase function in order to avoid
abrupt changes in the penalty function. However, the clinically
accepted normoglycemic target range, the hypoglycemic
alarm level (i.e., BG values below 40 mg/dl [35]), and the
hyperglycemic alarm level (i.e., BG values above 200 mg/dl
[8]) were respected in the design of the more smoothed func￾tion. This gave the advantage that penalties were gradually
increasing as a function of the increasing deviation from the
target range. Accordingly, BG measurement errors caused by
sensor inaccuracies and methodology inaccuracies due to
sampling handling only had a limited impact on the overall
assessment of a BG algorithm.
The smooth penalty function was subsequently optimized by
designing a polynomial function in the BG ranges 20 to 79
mg/dl and 111 to 250 mg/dl. The squared differences
between the staircase and the more smoothed function were
minimized by applying ordinary least squares [36]. The penalty
index corresponding to the normoglycemic range (80 to 110
mg/dl) was set at 0. BG values lower than 20 mg/dl and higher

than 250 mg/dl were assigned a maximum value to avoid that
outliers would distort the obtained GPI (as can be the case
with currently used evaluation methods; see above).
Comparison of GPI with currently used evaluation 
methods
The average morning BG, the average BG (i.e., the mean of all
BG readings), the HGI, and the GPI were computed for each
patient in the study set. Though the glycemic target range was
80 to 110 mg/dl, we defined 120 mg/dl as a 'clinically accept￾able' upper limit taking into account possible sensor inaccura￾cies and methodology inaccuracies due to sampling handling
[37-41]. Therefore, the cut-off values for evaluating the per￾formance of the BG algorithm were arbitrarily set as follows.
Average morning BG readings below 120 mg/dl, average BG
values below 120 mg/dl, and HGIs below 12 mg/dl (i.e., an
average hyperglycemic value below 108+12 = 120 mg/dl)
were labeled 'clinically acceptable'. The cut-off GPI that
explained whether the insulin titration algorithm was accepta￾ble or not was determined by entering 120 mg/dl, as cut-off
BG, to the developed smooth penalty function. Next, the per￾formance of the existing standard evaluation methods and the
GPI were compared both on individual and population basis.
Study procedure and patient population
We assembled two different data sets obtained from patients
who had been admitted to the surgical ICU division of the Uni￾versity Hospital KU Leuven (Belgium) and who had been
treated by the same nursing team but for whom a different BG
sampling frequency was used. Whole BG in undiluted arterial
blood was measured by means of the same glucose analyzer
(ABL700 Radiometer Medical, Copenhagen) in both patient
groups. The first patient group comprised 41 subjects (patient
group 1) who were retrospectively selected from the data orig￾inally described in [8]. They were chosen to cover variable
demographics (Table 2) and durations of stay in the ICU. The
goal was to retrieve a representative sample for the larger
patient group of [8] in terms of duration of intensive care and
proportion of diagnostic subgroups. The BG sampling fre￾quency and insulin titration guidelines (as described in [11])
were identical for all patients. The second patient group com￾prised 52 subjects (patient group 2) with variable demograph￾ics and duration of stay in the ICU, of whom only the first 2
days were considered, during which the sampling frequency
was set at once every hour. Only those patients who were
expected to have a duration of stay of more than 2 days were
selected for this study. The titration was performed by the
same nursing staff, who followed the same guidelines, as used
for patient group 1.

range, however, remains 80 to 110 mg/dl with a corresponding penalty 
value equal to 0.

Except for the different BG sampling frequency and the dura￾tion of algorithm application, both patient groups varied for
type of illness and the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation; [42]) score. The average APACHE
II score was higher in group 2. The differences between the
patient groups allowed us to analyze the influence (weight) of
the four selected clinically relevant parameters (see below) on
GPI in an appropriate way. Informed consent was obtained
from the closest family member at ICU admission. The study
protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review
Board.
Definition of parameters
Four different parameters were selected based on their clini￾cally expected influence on GPI. The first parameter was the
average BG sampling frequency (f), which was the average
number of BG readings (per time unit) that were available and
used by the insulin titration algorithm. The conversion to time
dimension was realized by taking the inverse of the frequency
(e.g., f = 0.5 h-1 corresponds to a time interval of 2 h). The sec￾ond parameter was the duration of algorithm application (D),
which was the time period that the control algorithm was
effectively used for a given patient. The next parameter was the
severity of disease (A), scored by the APACHE II score, still
the most reported and used system in ICU and, therefore, the
one selected for this study (although more recent scoring sys￾tems may perform better at grading severity of illness). The
APACHE II score of the first 24 h after admission to the ICU
was calculated for each patient using parameters of acute
physiology and chronic healthcare. The final parameter under
study was the type of illness. As an example, eight reasons for
admission to the ICU were considered in this analysis: cardiac
surgery (type 1), multiple trauma or severe burns (type 2), neu￾rologic disease, cerebral trauma or complicated brain surgery
(type 3), complicated lung or esophageal thoracic surgery,
respiratory insufficiency, or both (type 4), complicated abdom￾inal surgery or peritonitis (type 5), transplantation (type 6),
complicated vascular surgery (type 7), and others (type 8).
Statistics
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing the medians
of two or more groups of data. Depending on the distribution
of the residuals, general and generalized linear models were
built. In the general linear model, the Shapiro-Wilk test was

applied for testing the normality of the residuals. The determi￾nation of the significance (weight) of the specific parameter on
GPI (i.e., 'input selection' for the model) was based on F-tests
for the general linear model and the likelihood ratio Chi-square
statistics for the generalized linear model. For the last type of
model, Wald statistics were used. Pearson's correlation coef￾ficients (R) were calculated for quantifying the relation
between continuous variables. In all applied tests p values <
0.05 were considered to be significant.
Results
Mathematical computation of GPI
The clinically defined staircase penalty function was trans￾formed to a more smoothed penalty function. The obtained
function was mathematically formulated as follows:
For time step t = 1 to Ntotal:
BGt < 20 mg/dl: βi = 100,
20 mg/dl ≤ BGt < 80 mg/dl: βi = 7.4680 (80 – BGt
)0.6337,
80 mg/dl ≤ BGt ≤ 110 mg/dl: γj = 0,
110 mg/dl <BGt ≤ 250 mg/dl: δk = 6.1767 (BGt – 110)0.5635,
250 mg/dl <BGt
: δk = 100
where βi was the penalty index for a glucose reading BGt of the
hypoglycemic range (i.e., BGt < 80 mg/dl), γj for the normogly￾cemic range (i.e., 80 mg/dl ≤ BGt ≤ 110 mg/dl), and δk for the
hyperglycemic range (i.e., BGt > 110 mg/dl). The indices i, j,
and k were used to count the number of hypoglycemic, normo￾glycemic, and hyperglycemic events, respectively. The symbol
that represents the number of BG measurements in the full gly￾cemic range (that were available for the considered patient)
was Ntotal. This more smoothed function is illustrated in Figure
1 (solid line).
All BG values from a patient corresponded to specific penalty
values as directly followed from the smoothed function. Next,
the GPI was calculated for each patient:
where NHypo is the symbol for the number of BG measure￾ments in the hypoglycemic range, and NHyper the symbol for the
hyperglycemic range. The relative contribution of the hypogly￾cemic values to GPI (denoted as CHypo) was determined as
follows:
Analogously, the relative contribution of the hyperglycemic val￾ues to GPI (denoted as CHyper) was computed as follows:
Comparison of GPI with currently used methods
The 'clinically acceptable' upper limit BG (120 mg/dl) was
entered into the above developed smoothed penalty function,
giving 23 as 'clinically acceptable' cut-off GPI. Next, the
inverse smoothed penalty function was used to compute the
lower limit BG that corresponded to GPI = 23 (Figure 1). The
'clinically acceptable' BG range was found to be 74 to 120
mg/dl but the glycemic target range remained at 80 to 110
mg/dl. In other words, a computed GPI below 23 allowed us
to conclude that the insulin titration algorithm was able to con￾trol BG according to the clinical requirements. Ideally, how￾ever, all BG readings should fall within the 80 to 110 mg/dl
zone leading to a GPI equal to 0.
Table 3 gives a detailed overview of the results of the evalua￾tion methods (average morning BG, average BG, HGI, GPI,
and the relative contribution of the low (Chypo) and high (Chyper)
BG observations to the computed GPI) that are applied to
patient group 1. A summary of this is presented in Table 4. Fig￾ures 2 and 3 further summarize the performance differences
between the evaluation methods applied to the individual
patients. The correlation coefficients for the already existing
measures with respect to GPI are depicted in each respective
panel. Finally, Figure 4 illustrates the BG profile of patient no.
19 (top panel, no misleading effect of standard assessment
methods), whose BG was tightly controlled, and patient no. 11
(bottom panel, assessment misled by average (morning) BG
and HGI) with poor BG control (see also Table 4 for exactly
computed measures).
In most studies, however, the BG control algorithm is evalu￾ated using the patient population rather than on individual
patients [8,9,20,21,27]. The population results for patient
group 1 are mentioned in Table 4. The most appropriate way
to present the population HGI and GPI values is by calculating
the median and 25% to 75% interquartile (IQ) range as these
data were not normally distributed.

Weight determination for the selected parameters
The impact of the variables under study on GPI for the patients
belonging to patient group 2 and 1 (but considering only the
data of the first 48 h in the latter) is illustrated in Figure 5. As
the duration of algorithm application was set at 48 h, this vari￾able was not included in this analysis. The p values of the null
hypothesis that the GPI medians per group are equal are
noted in each respective panel (only significant inequality for
the average BG sampling frequency). Multiple regression anal￾ysis on these data revealed that the average BG sampling fre￾quency was the only parameter that significantly (p = 0.0051)
impacted the assessment of insulin titration algorithms: an
inversely proportional effect was observed.
Figure 6 illustrates the independent impact of all four variables
under study on GPI for patient group 1 (considering all the
available data of this group). The obtained p values of the null
hypothesis that the GPI medians per group are equal are again
noted in the respective panels (significant inequality for the
average BG sampling frequency and duration of algorithm
application). Multiple regression analysis returned that both
duration of algorithm application (p = 0.032) and the product
of duration of algorithm application and average BG sampling
frequency (p = 0.025) significantly influenced GPI. The first
parameter was directly proportional to GPI whereas the prod￾uct was inversely proportional to GPI. Moreover, a negative
correlation (R = -0.42, p = 0.0069 for the 'no-correlation' null
hypothesis) between the variables duration of algorithm appli￾cation and average BG sampling frequency was found.
The impact of the duration of algorithm application on GPI is

ticular patient. Each line of Figure 7 represents the GPI evolu￾tion of this specific patient as a function of the number of data
(i.e., the time spent in the ICU) that were considered in the
calculation process of GPI. For the majority of the patients, a
decreasing GPI trend could be observed as more data (longer
duration of the applied algorithm) were taken into
consideration.z
Discussion
In this study we developed the GPI as a tool for assessing the
dynamics of glycemic control in ICU patients. The designed
formula returned a number between 0 and 100 with an 'ideal'
level of 0 (indicating that all measured BG values fell within the
normoglycemic target range) and a 'clinically acceptable' level
of 23. Further, it was shown that GPI summarized the moni￾tored glucose profile into one number more precisely than the
traditional evaluation tools based on currently available clinical
expertise. Finally, the average BG sampling frequency and the
duration of algorithm application were found to be parameters
that should be comparable for patient groups when comparing
the performance of insulin titration algorithms.
Mathematical computation of GPI
The developed GPI tool summarizes the level of tight glycemic
control into a single number based on a grading system that
scores low and high BG readings depending on their deviation
from the target range. There are many advantages of GPI over
the current standard methods. First, since both low and high
BG readings are taken into account, GPI measures the overall
BG dynamics. Since the assigned penalties are always abso￾lute (positive), it is not possible that hypoglycemic and hyper￾glycemic penalties balance each other as can be the case
when computing the average (morning) BG.
Second, only the BG readings that were effectively monitored
are used in the GPI evaluation tool. Accordingly, unlike for
area-under-the-curve methods, the GPI does not rely on any
assumed (linear) relationship between measurements. While
awaiting the creation of reliable near-continuous sensor
devices for BG monitoring in an ICU setting, this is an
important aspect as these assumed (linear) relations between
observations do not necessarily approach the real (non-linear)
blood glucose dynamics.
Third, a smooth penalty function (Figure 1) forms the basis of
GPI leading to a gradual increase of the assigned penalties as
the deviations from normoglycemia are enlarging.
Measurement errors caused by sensor inaccuracies and meth￾odology inaccuracies due to sampling handling have only a

shows the average morning blood glucose (BG) readings as a function of GPI. The middle panel represents the average BG values versus the GPI 
values. Finally, the bottom panel illustrates the computed HGI values as a function of GPI. The shaded area contains those patients whose BG pro￾file was evaluated differently: 'clinically acceptable' for the standard measures, 'clinically unacceptable' for GPI. The stars denote the patients from 
group 1 whereas the diamonds represent the patients from group 2. The correlation coefficients (R) for the existing measures with respect to GPI 
are depicted in the respective panels.

small level of influence on the assignment of the penalty,
accordingly.
A fourth important feature of GPI is the independency of outlier
measurements. Due to the imposed limits in the penalty func￾tion (if BG < 20 mg/dl or BG > 250 mg/dl, then β = δ = 100),
extreme BG measurements (that may be related to sensor/
methodology inaccuracies) cannot mislead the general
algorithm assessment. Moreover, BG values lower or higher
than these imposed limits would not lead to a clinically differ￾ent treatment. This concept formed the basis of the specific
region strategy in the error grid analysis for the evaluation of
glucose sensors, as reported previously [32,33,43].
Finally, the computation of the relative contribution of the hypo￾and hyperglycemic events to GPI allows us to further interpret
the obtained GPI value. If we consider the BG profile of patient
no. 1 (from patient group 1) as an example (see Table 4),
based on the high GPI that was obtained (GPI = 49 > 23) it
could be concluded that BG was poorly controlled in this
patient. The relative contributions (expressed in terms of per￾centage) of the hypo- and hyperglycemic events (CHypo and
CHyper, respectively) to GPI informed the clinician whether this
non-optimal control behavior was caused by particularly low
glucose events (if CHypo > 75%), high glucose events (if CHyper
> 75%), or both (if CHypo ≈ CHyper). The non-optimal perform￾ance of the algorithm for this patient example was mainly
caused by the hyperglycemic events due to the large value for
Chyper (see Table 4).
Comparison of GPI with currently used methods
The computed GPI can be used to appropriately evaluate the
level of tight glycemic control in a single patient based on clin￾ical expertise. Existing methods may mislead an assessment,
as is shown for patient no. 11 in Figure 4 (bottom panel). The
average morning BG (103 mg/dl ≤ 120 mg/dl), the average
BG (100 mg/dl ≤ 120 mg/dl), and the HGI (4 mg/dl ≤ 12 mg/
dl) all suggest strict glycemic control whereas the GPI (27 >
23) denotes the less tightly controlled BG signal based on
clinical expert knowledge. Both hypoglycemic and hyperglyc￾emic events can be observed in the BG profile, which is further
confirmed by the similarity between CHypo and CHyper for this
patient.
Figures 2 and 3 summarize the assessment of the individual
BG profiles by applying the existing methods and GPI. The
shaded area is defined by the GPI 'clinical unacceptability' cut￾off (GPI > 23) and the 'clinical acceptability' limits of the
known techniques (average (morning) BG ≤ 120 mg/dl, HGI ≤
12 mg/dl). In other words, the evaluation of the BG profiles of
the patients belonging to this area may be misled by the exist￾ing methods (particularly the average morning BG and aver￾age BG, due to their high number of patients in the shaded
areas and, to a lesser degree, the HGI). In fact, only few BG

The bloo e full dataset) d glucose (BG) pro￾files of the patients of group 1 are evaluated by applying the same standard techniques as mentioned in Figure 2 and are again presented as a func￾tion of GPI. The patients that belong to the shaded area got a different algorithm evaluation dependent on the method that was used (respective 
'standard' method versus GPI). The shaded area contains those patients whose BG profile was evaluated differently: 'clinically acceptable' for the 
standard measures, 'clinically unacceptable' for GPI.

profiles were evaluated differently with HGI indicating that this
method most approaches the clinical 'expert' GPI function.
This also occurs in the high correlation coefficients for HGI
and GPI.
The assessment of the performance of the BG algorithm on a
population basis also depended on the selected technique. As
observed in Table 4, the average morning BG (108 ± 20 mg/
dl) and the average BG (114 ± 21 mg/dl) were below 120 mg/
dl suggesting that the algorithm under study was adequate.
The computed IQ ranges for the average (morning) BG, both
below 120 mg/dl, confirmed this hypothesis. The computed
IQ ranges of HGI and GPI, however, indicated that the applied
algorithm did not result in clinically acceptable BG control for
at least 25% of the patients. Indeed, a quarter of the HGI
values were above 17 mg/dl (> 12 mg/dl) and a quarter of the
GPI values were above 27 (> 23).
This study shows that the two most traditional measures (aver￾age morning BG and average BG) used for summarizing the
overall glycemic control behavior, can mislead assessments of
BG algorithms. This confirms the results described in [44].
Techniques that take into account the duration of hyperglyc￾emia/hypoglycemia, such as HGI or the recently proposed
'notional duration of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia' (i.e., the
time since the observation of an abnormal BG till it returns to
the accepted range [44]) may better indicate tight glycemic
control. The GPI technique proposed in this manuscript, how￾ever, is explicitly founded on ICU expertise and may therefore
be an alternative (or at least a supplemental) tool for ade￾quately evaluating insulin titration algorithms in the ICU. The
BG profiles of most individual patients were equally assessed
using GPI and HGI, except for some patients as was illustrated
in Figures 2 and 3 (shaded areas of the bottom panels).
A first weakness of the GPI is the non-consideration of the
duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes since
no (linear) relationship between discrete-time BG observa￾tions is assumed. Accordingly, the algorithm assessment may
be misleading, as the number of intermittent BG
measurements (and the number of assigned penalties) can
typically be higher with unstable BG behavior (i.e., BG obser￾vations outside the normoglycemic target range). Only area￾under-the-curve measures (like HGI) can potentially take into
consideration the duration of these glycemic deviations under
the assumption that the imposed (linear) relationship between
the measurements approaches the real blood glucose dynam￾ics. Moreover, the duration of deviating episodes can only be
precisely taken into account with a reliable and accurate near￾continuous glucose sensor. The use of such a device for the

panel) and 11 (bottom panel) from group 1 are represented by stars. These BG profile examples denote tight glycemic control for patient no. 19 but 
rather poor glycemic control for patient no. 11. It is important to note that different time scales were used as patient no. 11 stayed in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) for only a short time period. Further, the obtained BG measurements were linearly interpolated. The normal BG range (target range) 
is indicated by the shaded area (80–110 mg/dl). The hyperglycemic index (HGI) is the area under the glucose curve above 6 mmol/l (108 mg/dl, as 
illustrated by the dashed line [28]). The morning BG values are indicated by the dotted arrows. Table 4 shows all computed measures in detail. 
Based on clinical expert knowledge, it can be observed that the assessment of the BG profile of patient no. 11 using the glycemic penalty index 
(GPI) is different from the evaluation with average (morning) BG and HGI.

evaluation of a BG algorithm even allows us to label the GPI
measure as area-under-the-curve method (that incorporates
the duration of glycemic deviations), since then a penalty is
'continuously' assigned to each BG (measured at each time
instant, e.g., every minute) and since hypoglycemic and hyper￾glycemic deviations cannot balance each other. While
awaiting reliable near-continuous glucose sensors [15,19,45],
it is advised to sample BG at fixed time intervals (e.g., every
hour or every 2 h for the duration of the study) to minimize the
effect of the current weakness.
A second weakness of GPI is the ignorance of the severity of
extreme (but exceptional) BG measurements due to hypo- and
hyperglycemic cut-off values (e.g., δ300 mg/dl = δ450 mg/dl = 100).
Though the reasons for using these cut-off values are well
founded (see above), we advise counting the number of alarm
BG observations (i.e., BG < 40 mg/dl [35] and BG > 200 mg/
dl [8]) to better interpret the obtained GPI.
Previous studies have already indicated the relationship
between improved clinical outcomes on the one hand and
reduced average morning BG [8,9] and reduced HGI [28] on
the other. It is important to note that the relationship between
GPI and clinical outcome has not been shown yet. The design
of GPI is purely founded on currently available clinical exper￾tise. Future studies are necessary to verify whether low GPIs
effectively correspond to reduced mortality and morbidity,
which is however expected from a clinical 'expert' point of view
and from the high correlation between GPI and HGI.
Weight determination for the selected parameters
The BG sampling frequency in the insulin titration guidelines
used in patient group 1, varied as a function of the level of gly￾cemic control. When the blood glucose was more difficult to
control (unstable glucose dynamics), more frequent sampling
occurred. The full patient data of group 1 comprised the initial
(unstable) and more chronic (stable) phase of each patient's
stay in the ICU. An increasing duration of algorithm application
(which implicitly indicates a longer stay in the ICU, typically
associated with more stable glucose dynamics) artificially
improved the average overall BG control behavior leading to
lower GPIs (see second panel of Figure 6). Figure 7
additionally clarifies the relationship between GPI and duration
of algorithm application. The GPI decreases when more data
(i.e., longer time/duration in the ICU) are considered in its com￾putation process.
Further, this increasing duration of algorithm application low￾ered the average BG sampling frequency (expressed in the
negative correlation between duration of algorithm application
and average BG sampling frequency) since less BG observa￾tions were required in the chronic 'stable' period (due to the
nature of the used protocol). Therefore, the first panel of Figure
6 that illustrates the relationship between tight glycemic con￾Figure 5

of the null hypothesis that the GPI medians per group are equal are mentioned in each panel. A significant difference was found for the average 
blood glucose (BG) sampling frequency: the BG profiles with f ≥ 0.5 h-1 (i.e., time intervals less than 2 h) are related to stricter glycemic control 
(lower GPI).

trol (low GPI) and a low average BG sampling frequency is
explained by the long time that the algorithm was applied to
the patients of group 1. In case the duration of algorithm
application was kept constant and limited (only the first 48 h
after admission), an increase of the BG sampling frequency
resulted in more strict BG control (lower GPI) as depicted in
the top panel of Figure 5. It can be concluded that both dura￾tion of algorithm application and average BG sampling fre￾quency are two important parameters that should be taken into
consideration when assessing or comparing different BG con￾trol algorithms.
Practical use
For the design of future studies that compare the performance
of different insulin titration algorithms applied to critically ill
patients, we encourage other research groups to rely on the
'similarity' condition: the duration of algorithm application and
the BG sampling frequency should be similar in patient
groups. We further encourage other groups to consider GPI
as supplemental tool to other advanced measures (e.g., HGI,
'notional duration of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia') besides
more traditional measures (e.g., average morning BG, average
BG) for adequately assessing the overall level of (BG) control.

equal are mentioned in each panel. A significant difference was found for the average BG sampling frequency and the duration of algorithm applica￾tion. The longer the algorithm is applied to the patient and the longer the time intervals between successive measurements, the tighter the glycemic 
control (lower GPI). The apparently contradictory impact of the BG sampling frequency on GPI can be explained by the negative correlation between 
the variables duration of algorithm application and average BG sampling frequency (see text).

Conclusion
The use of nurse-driven BG control algorithms is becoming
standard practice in ICUs. New (semi-automated) insulin titra￾tion algorithms are currently under development but require an
appropriate evaluation before accepting them as state-of-the￾art. In this study, we presented the computation of the GPI as
a tool to compare different BG control algorithms. This index
encompasses the overall BG dynamic behavior per patient in
a single number based on clinical expertise. The method is
affected by BG sampling frequency and duration of algorithm
application, which should be similar for adequate comparison
of these algorithms.

Key messages
The Glycemic Penalty Index (GPI) encompasses the overall 
BG dynamic behavior per patient in a single number. It 
is the average of all penalties that are individually 
assigned to each measured BG value based on an opti￾mized smooth penalty function.
The computation of GPI returns a number between 0 (no 
penalty) and 100 (the highest penalty).
The computation of GPI may be an alternative or supple￾mental tool to evaluate and to compare the performance 
of BG algorithms.
A higher BG sampling frequency and a longer algorithm 
application duration resulted in an apparently better per￾formance of the insulin titration algorithm, as indicated 
by a lower GPI.
The BG sampling frequency and the duration of algorithm 
application should be similar when comparing 
algorithms.
