Abstract
Pancreas transplantation is an invasive procedure that can restore and maintain normoglycemic
level very successfully and for a prolonged period in DM1 patients. The procedure elevates the
morbimortality rates in the first few months following the surgery if compared to kidney
transplants with living donors, but it offers a better quality of life to patients.
Although controversial, several studies have shown the stabilization or the improvement of some
of the chronic complications related to diabetes, as well as the extra number of years of life that
patients submitted to a double pancreas-kidney transplantation may gain.
Recent studies have demonstrated clashing outcomes regarding isolated pancreas transplantations,
a fact which reinforces the need for a more discerning selection of patients for this procedure.
Introduction
Before 1922, any patient diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes
Mellitus (DM1) had a life expectancy of nearly two more
years. However, isolation and industrial-scale insulin pro￾duction caused a revolution in the treatment of the dis￾ease, because it quickly transformed it from fatal to
chronic. The increase of life expectancy led to the appear￾ance of chronic complications, which occur from 10 to 20
years after the diagnosis. In the last decades, several med￾icines, including insulin analogs, have started to be mar￾keted and despite that, DM kept being a disease of difficult
control, with most patients presenting A1c targets above
the approved levels. Another limiting factor is the higher
incidences of hypoglycemia episodes, mainly among
patients in intensive insulin therapy. Therefore, despite
the improvement of life expectancy in patients under dial￾ysis replacement therapy, DM still persists as the main
cause of blindness, non-traumatic amputation of inferior

limbs and an important cause of mortality and morbidity
secondary to macroangiopathy [1].
One of the possible explanations for the high incidence of
complications is the difficulty in obtaining the proper
metabolic control for DM1 patients under renal replace￾ment therapy. During a pilot project at our facility, we
have noticed that in 76% of the time, patients were off the
recommended glycemic target, when evaluated by contin￾uous subcutaneous glucose holter monitoring, performed
on three instances: on dialysis day, the previous day and
one day after the procedure. Within this context, the pan￾creas transplantation is an effective alternative, which
leads to an improvement in glycemic control, for a pro￾longed time and with minimal glycemic variation.
Nearly one third of DM patients develop terminal renal
failure (TRF) [2] and until mid last century, patients in
this condition had few alternatives, once surgeons did not
considered them eligible for kidney transplantation due
to the lack of glycemic control, which drove, among other
complications, the reappearance of renal graft nephropa￾thy. On the other hand, they were considered by general
practitioners as patients of difficult metabolic control, due
to the progressive loss of the renal function - in other
words, little could be done for this subgroup of patients.
In 1966, Kelly et cols. [3] performed the first pancreas
transplantation in humans. Despite the patient's passing
after two months, it was demonstrated that it was possible
to reach glycemic control with this procedure. With the
improvement of surgical techniques, immunosuppres￾sion and multidisciplinary care involved in organ trans￾plantation, the outcomes advanced progressively and,
according to current data, over 23,000 pancreas transplan￾tations have been performed worldwide [4]. Brazil cur￾rently ranks a spotlight position, with over 800
procedures performed until de end of 2007, and out￾comes comparable to most international facilities.
The benefits of pancreas transplantations are the improve￾ment in the quality of life, the prevention of diabetic
nephropathy recurrence, the discontinuation of exoge￾nous insulin use and glycemic monitoring, dietary free￾dom and the potential benefit compared to the evolution
of chronic disease-related complications. The major diffi￾culty in discussing the evolution of chronic complications
which follow a pancreas transplantation in its several
modalities is the lack of randomized clinical trials and a
potential bias in patient selection and inclusion, such as
the absence of universal transplantation eligibility criteria
- mainly, the pancreas transplantation alone, where
groups point to bearers of two chronic complications and
others to patients with important instability, i.e., poten￾tially more complex. Another parameter that hinders the
follow-up is the use of immunosuppressant, which,
among other side effects, is potentially nephrotoxic.
The goal of this article is to present data from literature
and from our center regarding the evolution of chronic
complications that follow pancreas transplantations in its
several modalities.
Diabetic Nephropathy
The risk of microvascular complications caused by diabe￾tes is associated to glycemic control [5] and one of the rea￾sons for the execution of a pancreas transplantation alone
(PTA) is the renal protection that results from euglycemia.
Fioretto's classic paper written in 1998 [6] demonstrated
the importance of the maintenance of normoglycemia in
the reversion of histological renal lesions after 10 years in
DM1 patients submitted to isolated pancreas transplanta￾tion. However, not only is the population of patients stud￾ied small, but they have also presented an aggravation of
the kidney function, perhaps due to immunosuppression
[6] In another study, Farney et cols. [7] followed 97
patients submitted to PTA and it was shown that 9% of
them required replacement therapy initiation and were
generally patients that, upon entering the study, presented
creatinine clearance inferior to 55 ml/minute. The expla￾nations that support the aggravation were associated to
immunosuppression, volume contraction due to exocrine
bladder drainage, metabolic acidosis, among others.
In 2005, Copelli [8] compared DM1 patients submitted to
PTA with DM1 patients kept under intensive insulin ther￾apy (control group), similar in age, gender, diabetes type,
and use of statins and anti-hypertensive drugs. Trans￾planted patients presented better glycemic control, C-pep￾tide level normalization, and improvements in total and
LDL cholesterol, and arterial hypertension compared to
the control group. Transplanted normoalbuminuric
patients remained as such at baseline, and four micro￾albuminuric patients reverted to normoalbuminuria. Ini￾tial clearance was 95 ml/minute and, one year after the
procedure, 88 ml/minute - not a significant difference,
although indicative of an important improvement in
microalbuminuria. This was the first study in literature to
demonstrate an improvement in proteinuria, without
negatively affecting glomerular filtration rate. Factors
related to improvement were glycemic control; BP
enhancement and possibly the upswing in C-peptide lev￾els could have resulted in the improvement of endothelial
dysfunction due to an increased nitric oxide secretion [8].
These findings are promising, but there is still need for a
greater patient sample and an extended follow-up time for
the accreditations of the benefits of the procedure. Thus,
current medical evidence does not support the indication
of PTA for the prevention of diabetic nephropathy, once

the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressants, perhaps
linked to volume contraction due to bladder drainage, as
well as metabolic acidosis, may cause long-term damage
to the renal function, which seems more frequent as the
baseline renal function is worse [9].
Summary: Transplantation and Diabetic 
Nephropathy
• Normoglycemia for over five years is capable of
reverting histological lesions related to DN.
• Renal function may worsen even in patients with
normofunctioning pancreas, due to:
- Immunosuppression
- Volume contraction
- Metabolic acidosis
- Hyperglycemic memory
Diabetic Retinopathy following Pancreas 
Transplantation
In general, papers show a stabilization of retinopathy in
diabetic patients submitted to several modalities of pan￾creas transplantation. The greatest doubt revolves around
proliferative retinopathy (PR), considering that even with
reaching glycemic control, nearly 15% of patients pre￾sented a worsening of the condition. In 2006, one study
compared [10] DM1 patients submitted to PTAs and
patients kept under intensive insulin therapy, and showed
that among non-proliferative retinopathy individuals,
there was an even 50% ratio between improvement and
stabilization, compared to 20% improvement, 10% stabi￾lization and 70% worsening figures in the control group,
under intensive insulin therapy. In turn, in PR patients or
those submitted to laser surgery at a previous moment,
stabilization rates were 86% of transplanted patients ver￾sus 43% in the control group. Contrarily, 14% of these
patients presented worsening vs. 57% in the control
group. However, other authors do not report a difference
in retinopathy stabilization among patients with or with￾out a functioning pancreatic graft, especially among
patients with advanced retinopathy [11]. Our casuistry
with 112 patients submitted to SPKT shows that improve￾ment and stabilization occurred in 73.5%, primarily seen
in non-proliferative retinopathy, with an important
reduction in the number or ophthalmologic procedures
after 04 years, except for the greater need of facectomy,
perhaps resulting from the use of corticosteroids. (non￾published data). Improvement-related factors are glyc￾emic control, blood pressure control, lipid control and
even a potential anti-inflammatory action of immuno￾suppressant.
Summary: Pancreas Transplantationa and 
Diabetic Retinopathy
• May initially worsen.
• After four years or more, there is a reduction in the
number of surgical procedures.
• Increase in the number of cases of cataract
• In the proliferative form, there is no consensus regarding
benefits.
• Need for longer studies comprehending all forms of
pancreas transplantations.
Diabetic Neuropathy
Despite the high prevalence of diabetic neuropathy, not
many papers involve an important number of patients. A
classical study is Navarro et cols' [12], in which nearly 150
patients were followed for 10 years after transplantation,
and a quick sensitive and motor improvement was
observed, although the normalization of the parameters
studied was not observed. Allen et cols. [13], when follow￾ing up on 59 DM1 patients with SPKT for eight years,
described similar outcomes to Navarro's.
Autonomic neuropathy, whose presence is associated to a
higher mortality rate [14], may present an improvement
which usually takes place after a prolonged period, nearly
five years or more [12].
Coronary and Peripheral Arterial Disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death
among patients with diabetes mellitus. Several studies
show that glycemic control reduces the risk of microangi￾opathy in DM1 patients, but there are no prospective stud￾ies regarding CVD with a suitable patient population.
CVD prevalence is very high in DM1 patients with renal
disease, as observed by Oliveira et cols. [15] - this study
evaluated patients in line for a SPKT, no prior history of
angina and found 72% of patients with alterations in the
coronary cardiac catheterism. Regarding patients partici￾pating in our program, in the pre-transplant phase, 9%
performed angioplasty and 3%, open thoracic surgery.
Following the SPKT, we noticed an important reduction in
cardiovascular risk factors, represented by the metabolic
syndrome defined by NCEP-III criteria, which, in our cas￾uistry was only 11%. This finding can partly explain the
reduction in mortality rates among these patients, if com￾pared to DM patients submitted only to isolated kidney
transplantations [16]. Fibrinogen is also reduced, as well
as D-Dimers, homocysteine, triglycerides, von Willebrand
factor in SPKT receptors, compared to isolated kidney
receptors [17]. Other authors showed that in the five-year

post operative period, the occurrence of vascular diseases
is no different among SPKT and isolated kidney proce￾dures, whereas after seven to ten years, patients submitted
to SPKT present a significantly decreased incidence of
acute myocardial infarction (2.4% to 16% vs. 17.5% to
50%), stroke (16% vs. 40%) and amputations (16% vs.
30%) [17-20]. Figure 1.
Summary: Cardiovascular Disease and Pancreas 
Transplantation
• Most papers point to an improvement in CVD risk
factors.
• Diastolic ventricular dysfunction improves after
SPKT and PTA.
• CAD progression is milder in SPKT with a function￾ing pancreas.
• Mortality rates for SPKT are decreased when com￾pared to patients submitted to isolated kidney trans￾plantation from a deceased donor.
Final considerations
Pancreas transplantation is an invasive procedure that can
restore and maintain normoglycemic level very success￾fully and for a prolonged period in DM1 patients. The
procedure elevates the morbimortality rates in the first
few months following the surgery if compared to kidney
transplants with living donors, but it offers a better quality
of life to patients.
Although controversial, several studies have shown the
stabilization or the improvement of some of the chronic
complications related to diabetes, as well as the extra
number of years of life that patients submitted to a double
pancreas-kidney transplantation may gain.
Recent studies have demonstrated clashing outcomes
regarding isolated pancreas transplantations, a fact which
reinforces the need for a more discerning selection of
patients for this procedure.
