Orthopedic Surgery in Rheumatoid Arthritis in the Era
of Biologic Therapy

ABSTRACT. Objective. To analyze sociodemographic and clinic-related factors associated with the use of ortho￾pedic surgical procedures in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), focusing on the potential role of new biologic
therapies.
Methods. A retrospective medical record review was performed in a probability sample of 1272
patients with RA from 47 units distributed in 19 Spanish regions. Sociodemographic and clinical
features, use of drugs, and arthritis-related joint surgeries were recorded following a standardized
protocol. 
Results. A total of 94 patients (7.4%) underwent any orthopedic surgery during their disease course,
with a total of 114 surgeries; 47 (41.2%) of these surgeries were total joint replacement (TJR). The
median time to first orthopedic procedure was 7.9 years from the onset of RA symptoms, and the
rate of orthopedic surgery (excluding TJR) was 4.5 procedures per 100 person-years from the
beginning of RA, while the rate of TJR was 2.25 interventions per 100 person-years. A higher risk
of undergoing an orthopedic surgical procedure was associated with taking nonsteroidal antiinflam￾matory drugs (NSAID) in the previous 2 years, female sex, longterm disease, and the presence of
extraarticular complications. The risk factors for undergoing a TJR were being old, having a
longterm disease, and taking biologic therapies.
Conclusion. In the era of biologics, our national audit found a low percentage of patients who
underwent orthopedic surgery, probably reflecting a thorough management of the RA.
Sociodemographic factors, longterm RA, extraarticular complications, and NSAID were associated
with orthopedic surgery. (First Release Sept 15 2013; J Rheumatol 2013;40:1850–5; doi:10.3899/

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease
of unknown etiology and autoimmune nature, with a moder￾ately high prevalence1 and great disease burden on patients
in terms of pain, disability, and life expectancy2,3. RA is
characterized by chronic inflammation and polyarticular
destruction4,5. Usually damage is progressive and
irreversible, and causes deterioration in physical function
that is only partially recoverable with joint replacement.
Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment improve RA
outcomes such as inflammation and disability6. However,
progressive joint destruction continues in some patients, who
will require orthopedic surgery during their disease course7.
The percentage of patients with RA who undergo orthopedic
surgery is quite high, representing more than half8. Patients
undergoing an orthopedic surgery procedure have a worse
prognosis in terms of disability and quality of life; in
addition, they use more healthcare resources and social
services, with great socioeconomic consequences9,10,11. 
The use of orthopedic interventions in RA, particularly
large joint replacement, is considered a marker of disease
severity and an indicator of medical management failure6.
Several studies suggest that since 1985 there has been a
decrease in the need for orthopedic surgery, likely as a result
of advances in the management of RA12,13,14,15,16,17,18. In
2000 the emAR study (Estudio de la variabilidad en el
manejo de la artritis reumatoide en España — Study of the
variability in the management of rheumatoid arthritis in
Spain) found that up to 26% of patients with RA had
undergone any orthopedic procedure during their disease
course. The emAR also showed that clinical variables, such
as disease activity and severity, as well as geographic and
socioeconomic variables, were associated with orthopedic

surgery19. During the 10 years after the emAR study ended,
care for patients with RA underwent a revolution, with
earlier and more aggressive approaches as well as new
biologic treatments. Treat-to-target strategies that focus on
frequent monitoring and treatment adjustments to achieve
states of low disease activity or clinical remission may have
also contributed to superior longterm results20. This tight
disease control theory has been linked to a better under￾standing of the processes and development of rheumatology
care in our health system.
Our hypothesis was that 10 years after the emAR was
conducted, a second variability study, the emAR II, should
reflect changes in the management and outcome measures
of RA, including orthopedic surgery rates. RA variability
studies are important to understand the use of different
health resources and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures,
including such associated disease consequences as ortho￾pedic surgery, to improve the management and outcomes of
these patients.
The objectives of our study were (1) to describe the rates
of orthopedic surgical procedures in patients with RA in
Spain in recent years, and (2) to examine sociodemographic
and clinic-related factors associated with the use of ortho￾pedic procedures in this population, with attention to the
potential role of new biologic therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design, patient sample, and data collection. The emAR II, conducted
in 2010, is an audit study of the variability in the management of RA, with
the same design as the previous emAR study21: a cross-sectional national
study with retrospective review of the first year of disease plus the last 2
years of followup in rheumatology clinics throughout Spain. To have
belonged to the previous cohort was not an exclusion criterion.
The study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals
aged ≥ 16 years and diagnosed with RA by the 1987 American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) criteria22. They were followed at rheumatology
departments of Spanish hospitals and had at least 1 visit in the previous 2
years.
The emAR II used a stratified random sampling: first by autonomous
communities (regions into which Spain is administratively divided) and
then by hospital (first-stage units) and patient (second-stage units). To
avoid the lack of representativeness associated with the homogeneity of
hospitals of very different sizes, sampling with probability proportional to
size was conducted in the first stage, and equiprobable random selection of
patients in each center, in the second stage. 
Sample size was calculated assuming that the proportion of patients
requiring orthopedic surgery may have decreased from 26% to 18%
between the emAR studies, and that the change should be detected. Based
on this hypothesis, we obtained a minimum sample requirement of 1410
medical records, assuming an α error of 5%, a power of 80%, a percentage
of unreachable or incomplete medical records of 15%, and a design effect
of 2.5. 
Variables. Two primary outcomes were established for this analysis: (1) any
orthopedic surgery, defined as the report in the medical record of at least 1
RA-related orthopedic surgery including primary and secondary total joint
replacement (TJR) at any location, reconstructive joint surgery, resections,
joint fusions, and synovectomy. Fractures or infection-related surgeries
were excluded; and (2) TJR, defined as total replacement of a joint at any
location from the beginning of the RA. Revision surgery was considered as
a new RA-related surgery if first replacement was considered RA-related
(i.e., it was not a consequence of fracture or any other condition). TJR as a
consequence of fractures were not included. 
To assess variability in the primary outcomes, the following predictive
and confounding factors were considered: (1) sociodemographic variables
including sex, age, marital status (married vs not married), educational
level (any study degree vs no studies), social status (lower, middle, or upper
depending on the patient’s occupation according to the protocol of the
Spanish Society of Epidemiology)23; (2) disease-related variables,
including the date of RA onset and diagnosis, disease duration (short-term
RA as < 10 yrs of RA duration vs longterm RA as ≥ 10 yrs disease
duration), ACR functional class or grade, range of values for erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) throughout the
study period, maximum and minimum number of tender and swollen joints
during the study period, rheumatoid factor (RF), extraarticular complica￾tions, and comorbid medical conditions; and (3) pharmacological variables
such as drugs prescribed in the last 2 years including maximum and
minimum doses of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD),
biologic agents, nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAID), corticosteroids, analgesics, gastric protection, and drugs for
treatment or prophylaxis of osteoporosis. 
To identify patients with more active disease, we constructed the
variable “Activity” defined as active_ESR (ESR > 50 mm/h on 2 visits
during the study period) and/or active_DAS [a minimum of 3.2 in DAS28
(28-joint Disease Activity Score) on 2 visits] and/or active_Physician
(moderate or severe activity according to the rheumatologist on 2 
determinations).
In addition, we used the common descriptive variables for patients with
RA collected from the same source. All patient data were extracted from
medical records by researchers trained in standardized data collection.
Data analysis. Patients were described using summary statistics. We
estimated the rate of any orthopedic surgery and of TJR with 95% CI.
Orthopedic surgery and TJR incidence rates were estimated by dividing the
number of new surgeries occurring during followup by the number of
person-years of exposure. Both rates are given per 100 person-years. We
compared with previous cohort emAR I with a chi-squared test. Bivariate
logistic regression analyses were performed to measure the association
between any orthopedic surgery or TJR and secondary variables. Then 2
multivariate logistic regression models were run to identify independent
predictive factors associated with orthopedic surgery or TJR. The results of
the logistic regression analyses were expressed as OR. The criterion to
include a variable in the multivariate models was reaching a p < 0.10 in the
bivariate analysis. All regression models were additionally adjusted for age,
sex, clinical variables, and disability.
All analyses were performed using Stata 13.0 statistical software (Stata
Corp.).
RESULTS
Study population. A total of 47 patients agreed to participate
in the study; 138 records were not located or were incom￾plete for the purposes of the study. Thus, the final sample
comprised 1272 records from patients with RA, distributed
in 19 Spanish regions. Missing and incomplete records were
equally distributed among the regions. 
Sociodemographic and clinical features of patients are
shown in Table 1. A majority (73%) were women, with a
median age of 63.3 years and median disease duration of
almost 8 years. ESR median values ranged between 11 and
33 mm/h. Some type of comorbidity was registered in
49.4% of patients. The most common comorbidities found
were hypertension (28.2%) and diabetes mellitus (10.2%).

half the patients were able to perform all activities of daily
living (51%), 23% had slight disability (grade II), and
25.7% had ACR functional grade III/IV. Regarding factors
of poor prognosis, the proportion of patients who were
RF-positive was quite high, and over half had an erosive
disease. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody was
positive in 69.6% of patients. A total of 31.5% of patients
had some extraarticular complication, the most frequent
being rheumatoid nodules.
Treatments. RA treatments were recorded at every visit and
are shown in Table 2. Corticosteroids were taken by 67.6%
of the patients, and 67.3% took NSAID at some point during
the previous 2 years. Most of the patients had been treated
with DMARD, and 20.7% had taken 2 or more DMARD. A
total of 36.9% of patients were prescribed any biologic
treatment. The most frequent biologic treatment was
etanercept, followed by adalimumab and infliximab. The
median time from diagnosis to the start of biologic treatment
was 59.8 months, with 25th and 75th percentiles of 23.9 and
125.7 months. The median duration of the biologic
treatment was 10.3 months (P25-75 3.5 to 26.1).
Type and rate of orthopedic surgery. A total of 94 patients
(7.4%) underwent any orthopedic surgery during their
disease course, with a total of 114 first surgeries; 47 (41.2%)
of these surgeries were TJR. Bilateral procedures were
included and considered as separate cases. There were also
38 revision surgeries (13 of these were TJR). These were not
included in subsequent analyses.
In the previous similar cohort of emAR I, a significantly
higher percentage (25.9%) of the patients had any ortho￾pedic procedure (p < 0.0001).
The median time to first orthopedic procedure was 7.9
years from the onset of RA symptoms, and the rate of any
orthopedic surgery (except TJR) was 4.5 procedures per 100
person-years from the beginning of RA, while the rate of
TJR was 2.25 interventions per 100 person-years.
We performed a new separate analysis comparing
patients who received biologic therapy with those who did
not. For patients who had biologic therapy, the rate of any
orthopedic surgery (except TJR) was 4.67 procedures per
100 person-years from the beginning of RA, while the rate
of TJR was 3.1 interventions per 100 person-years. For
patients without biologic therapy, the rate of any orthopedic
surgery (except TJR) was 4.23 procedures per 100
person-years from the beginning of RA, while the rate of
TJR was 2.35 interventions per 100 person-years.
Table 3 describes the location and the number of ortho￾pedic surgeries performed. The most common types of
surgery in patients with RA were TJR (41.2%), surgeries

without replacement (33.3%), and soft tissue interventions
(13.2%). Only 8 spinal surgeries (including cervical and
lumbar; 7%) and 4 arthroscopies (3.5%) were performed.
The most common surgical complication was infection
(9.6%), but most surgeries (66.7%) were free of any compli￾cation. There were no deaths as a result of surgery.
Variables associated with undergoing any orthopedic
surgery and specifically TJR. In the bivariate analysis to
assess the risk of undergoing any orthopedic surgery, the
variables that reached statistical significance were taking
NSAID in the previous 2 years (OR 1.69, 95% CI
1.07–2.66), female sex (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.12–3.11),
longterm disease (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.43–3.30), and the
presence of extraarticular complications (OR 1.59, 95% CI
1.26–2.00). When these variables were entered into a multi￾variate regression model (Table 4), all remained associated
with a higher risk of undergoing an orthopedic surgical
procedure. The multivariate model included age, clinical
disease activity, CRP, and RF for adjustment.
The same strategy of analysis was followed using as the
dependent variable having had any TJR during the devel￾opment of RA. First, in bivariate analyses, the variables that
achieved statistical significance were age, with increased
risk to older patients (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.85–3.33), and
longterm disease (over 10 yrs; OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.69–3.50).
The multivariate model included sex, age, CRP, and RF for
adjustment, plus others that showed some trend in the
bivariate analysis, such as steroids (OR 1.68, 95% CI
0.85–3.33), biologic therapy (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.94–2.95),
and extraarticular RA (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.55–2.10). After
adjustment, being older, having a longterm disease, and
having been prescribed biologic therapies fit in the final
model (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
The need for orthopedic interventions in RA, particularly
replacement of large joints, is considered a marker of
disease severity and an indicator of medical management
failure. In our study we described the trend for orthopedic
surgical procedures in patients with RA in Spain. There was
a marked decrease in the percentage of patients who
underwent any orthopedic surgery in the biologic era, and if
we compared our results with a similar previous cohort19,
rates declined from 25.9% to 7.4%, with an OR 0.79 and a
decrease of 20% in the rate ratio.
The study was done in a very representative sample of
patients with RA. There were not only Spanish patients with
RA, but also other European patients with RA, because
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are quite
similar24. 
From the middle of the 1990s through 2010, RA
management underwent several changes, the first of which
was the window of opportunity concept and then the
tight-control theory13,25. The use of methotrexate has
consistently increased, and it is now established as the
leading DMARD26,27. Moreover, early, aggressive,
combined therapy, optimization doses of DMARD, and the
use of biologics have become popular in Western countries,
representing new, radical approaches in RA
treatment27,28,29. These changes enable a tighter control of
disease activity, and as a result, the clinical outcomes of
patients with RA have been consistently improving. We
demonstrated that surgery is being performed earlier after
the onset of symptoms (4 yrs earlier compared with emAR
I)9. There was a marked decrease in the percentage of
patients who underwent orthopedic surgery, going from
25.9% to 7.4% compared to studies conducted several years
ago, probably reflecting a thorough management of the
disease9,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. This improved management
seems to be reflected also in functional status, measured
with ACR class or grade, with a lower percentage of patients
having ACR functional grade III/IV (25.7 vs 33.1%) as
compared to previous studies19. 
Biologic therapies appeared at first as an option for
patients with more severe diseases and DMARD failure and

especially with established joint damage, which may
explain the increase of risk of TJR in patients taking
biologic therapy. However, this trend has changed, and
biologic therapies are replacing other therapeutic options
such as switching or adding classical DMARD to achieve
remission in recently diagnosed patients. This shift to
biologic therapies may explain the decrease in the overall
rate of orthopedic surgeries compared with our previous
data. In our cohort, patients with the greatest structural
damage were treated with biologic therapy but that did not
reverse the damage, and ultimately they needed TJR.
Thus in recent decades, the disease has a better
prognosis. This improvement may reflect early diagnosis
and adequate treatment rather than a change in character￾istics of the disease process30. In fact, a few variables, as
well as some sociodemographic nonmodifiable factors
independently associated with orthopedic surgery, remain
similar to those previously found. As has been reported,
women with RA are more likely to undergo orthopedic
surgery than men2,3,9,31,32,33, reflecting a greater extent of
the disease among women and perhaps a higher social
burden, different patterns of pain perception, or cosmetic
concerns. 
Age was also related to greater probability of TJR. The
aging of the total population, as a result of advances in
medical treatment, among other causes, means that there is
a growing number of older patients with RA who have
major damage due to joint degeneration. These patients
undergo an increased number of surgical operations related
to aging, to preserve their function and quality of life.
Longterm RA and extraarticular complications remain as
risk factors for orthopedic surgery in emAR II. 
The use of NSAID also emerged as a risk factor for
orthopedic surgery in our study. The patient may experience
improvement in pain and joint function with NSAID, but
erosion is not prevented, thus leading to the orthopedic
surgery. 
Biologic therapies have arisen as an option for patients
with more severe disease and DMARD failure. Most of
them have established joint damage, which may explain the
increase in risk of TJR in patients taking biologic therapy.
This is probably a result of the change in treatment trends,
which has considered the biologic/DMARD combined as a
second or third choice for poorly controlled patients34,35,36,
replacing other therapeutic options such as switching or
adding classical DMARD. However, because the greatest
structural damage occurs within the first 2 years from the
onset of symptoms37, biologic therapies slow down the
disease but do not reverse the damage.
The recent rapid advances in drug therapy have had
significant consequences, as this study shows; the number of
surgeries has drastically declined compared with emAR I9.
In the near future, this trend may continue. Further advances
in drug therapy and management could reduce the severity
of bone-joint destruction related to RA. This may contribute
to a decrease in the amount of RA-related joint surgery,
especially joint replacements. However, the general
population, and therefore patients with RA, will be getting
older in the coming years, and the number of elderly patients
needing orthopedic surgery related to aging will increase.
The main limitation of our study is that it was a retro￾spective cross-sectional method based on medical record
review and not designed so much to identify predictive
factors for surgery as to determine actual trends in ortho￾pedic surgery. However, the results of this study can be
extrapolated to the whole population of Spain. 
Despite the decrease of orthopedic surgeries through
modifiable factors, patients undergoing an orthopedic
surgery have a worse prognosis related to disability and
quality of life. Thus, further advances are needed in earlier
diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, as well as tight
control, to avoid progressive joint destruction. Moreover,
orthopedic surgery in patients with RA represents a signifi￾cant part of the cost of the disease10, and it is still necessary
to work to reduce the number of orthopedic surgeries in
patients with RA.
