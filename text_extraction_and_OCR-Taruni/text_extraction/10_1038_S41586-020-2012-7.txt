Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large 
number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their 
natural reservoir host, bats1–4
. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs 
have the potential to infect humans5–7
. Here we report the identification and 
characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of 
acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started 
on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 
deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five 
patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and 
share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 
96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein 
sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this 
virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from 
the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera 
from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry 
receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.
Coronaviruses have caused two large-scale pandemics in the past 
two decades, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)8,9
. 
It has generally been thought that SARSr-CoV—which is mainly found 
in bats—could cause a future disease outbreak10,11. Here we report 
on a series of cases caused by an unidentified pneumonia disease 
outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, central China. This disease out￾break—which started from a local seafood market—has grown sub￾stantially to infect 2,761 people in China, is associated with 80 deaths 
and has led to the infection of 33 people in 10 additional countries 
as of 26 January 202012. Typical clinical symptoms of these patients 
are fever, dry cough, breathing difficulties (dyspnoea), headache 
and pneumonia. Disease onset may result in progressive respiratory 
failure owing to alveolar damage (as observed by transverse chest 
computerized-tomography images) and even death. The disease was 
determined to be caused by virus-induced pneumonia by clinicians 
according to clinical symptoms and other criteria, including a rise in 
body temperature, decreases in the number of lymphocytes and white 
blood cells (although levels of the latter were sometimes normal), new 
pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and no obvious improve￾ment after treatment with antibiotics for three days. It appears that 
most of the early cases had contact history with the original seafood 
market; however, the disease has now progressed to be transmitted 
by human-to-human contact.
Samples from seven patients with severe pneumonia (six of whom are 
sellers or deliverymen from the seafood market), who were admitted to 
the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital at the beginning 
of the outbreak, were sent to the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology (WIV) for the diagnosis of the causative pathogen (Extended 
Data Table 1). As a laboratory investigating CoV, we first used pan-CoV 
PCR primers to test these samples13, given that the outbreak occurred in 
winter and in a market—the same environment as SARS infections. We 
found five samples to be PCR-positive for CoVs. One sample (WIV04), 
collected from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), was analysed by 
metagenomics analysis using next-generation sequencing to identify 
potential aetiological agents. Of the 10,038,758 total reads—of which 
1,582 total reads were retained after filtering of reads from the human 
genome—1,378 (87.1%) sequences matched the sequence of SARSr￾CoV (Fig. 1a). By de novo assembly and targeted PCR, we obtained a 
29,891-base-pair CoV genome that shared 79.6% sequence identity 
to SARS-CoV BJ01 (GenBank accession number AY278488.2). High 
genome coverage was obtained by remapping the total reads to this 
genome (Extended Data Fig. 1). This sequence has been submitted to 
GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (accession number EPI_ISL_402124). 
Following the name given by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
we tentatively call it novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). Four more 
full-length genome sequences of 2019-nCoV (WIV02, WIV05, WIV06 and

WIV07) (GISAID accession numbers EPI_ISL_402127–402130) that were 
more than 99.9% identical to each other were subsequently obtained 
from four additional patients using next-generation sequencing and 
PCR (Extended Data Table 2).
The virus genome consists of six major open-reading frames (ORFs) 
that are common to coronaviruses and a number of other accessory 
genes (Fig. 1b). Further analysis indicates that some of the 2019-nCoV 
genes shared less than 80% nucleotide sequence identity to SARS-CoV. 
However, the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase 
domains in ORF1ab that were used for CoV species classification were 
94.4% identical between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, suggesting that 
the two viruses belong to the same species, SARSr-CoV.
We then found that a short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
(RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13)—which was previously 
detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province—showed high 
sequence identity to 2019-nCoV. We carried out full-length sequencing 
on this RNA sample (GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_402131). Simplot 
analysis showed that 2019-nCoV was highly similar throughout the 
genome to RaTG13 (Fig. 1c), with an overall genome sequence identity 
of 96.2%. Using the aligned genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, RaTG13, 
SARS-CoV and previously reported bat SARSr-CoVs, no evidence for 
recombination events was detected in the genome of 2019-nCoV. Phy￾logenetic analysis of the full-length genome and the gene sequences of 
RdRp and spike (S) showed that—for all sequences—RaTG13 is the clos￾est relative of 2019-nCoV and they form a distinct lineage from other 
SARSr-CoVs (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2). The receptor-binding 
spike protein encoded by the S gene was highly divergent from other 
CoVs (Extended Data Fig. 2), with less than 75% nucleotide sequence 
identity to all previously described SARSr-CoVs, except for a 93.1% 
nucleotide identity to RaTG13 (Extended Data Table 3). The S genes of 
2019-nCoV and RaTG13 are longer than other SARSr-CoVs. The major 
differences in the sequence of the S gene of 2019-nCoV are the three 
short insertions in the N-terminal domain as well as changes in four out 
of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared with 
the sequence of SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig. 3). Whether the inser￾tions in the N-terminal domain of the S protein of 2019-nCoV confer 
sialic-acid-binding activity as it does in MERS-CoV needs to be further 
studied. The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 provides evi￾dence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats.
We rapidly developed a qPCR-based detection method on the basis 
of the sequence of the receptor-binding domain of the S gene, which 
was the most variable region of the genome (Fig. 1c). Our data show 
that the primers could differentiate 2019-nCoV from all other human 
coronaviruses including bat SARSr-CoV WIV1, which shares 95% identity 
with SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Of the samples obtained from 
the seven patients, we found that six BALF and five oral swab samples 
were positive for 2019-nCoV during the first sampling, as assessed 
by qPCR and conventional PCR. However, we could no longer detect 
virus-positive samples in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samples 
taken from these patients during the second sampling (Fig. 2a). How￾ever, we recommend that other qPCR targets, including the RdRp or 
envelope (E) genes are used for the routine detection of 2019-nCoV. 
On the basis of these findings, we propose that the disease could be 
transmitted by airborne transmission, although we cannot rule out 
other possible routes of transmission, as further investigation, includ￾ing more patients, is required.

For serological detection of 2019-nCoV, we used a previously devel￾oped nucleocapsid (N) protein from bat SARSr-CoV Rp3 as antigen 
for IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), as 
this protein shared 92% amino acid identity to N protein of 2019-nCoV 
(Extended Data Fig. 5) and showed no cross-reactivity against other 
human coronaviruses except SARSr-CoV7
. We were only able to obtain 
five serum samples from the seven patients with viral infections. We 
monitored viral antibody levels in one patient (ICU-06) 7, 8, 9 and 
18 days after the onset of disease (Extended Data Table 2). A clear trend 
was observed in the IgG and IgM titres, which increased over time, 
except that the IgM titre was decreased in the last sample (Fig. 2b). 
As a second analysis, we tested samples from 5 of the 7 virus-positive 
patients around 20 days after disease onset for the presence of viral 
antibodies (Extended Data Tables 1, 2). All patient samples—but not 
samples from healthy individuals—were strongly positive for viral IgG 
(Fig. 2b). There were also three IgM-positive samples, indicating an 
acute infection.
We next successfully isolated the virus (called 2019-nCoV BetaCoV/
Wuhan/WIV04/2019) from both Vero E6 and Huh7 cells using the BALF 
sample of patient ICU-06. Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed 
in cells after incubation for three days (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). The 
identity of the strain WIV04 was verified in Vero E6 cells by immuno￾fluorescence microscopy using the cross-reactive viral N antibody 
(Extended Data Fig. 6c, d) and by metagenomics sequencing, most of 
the reads of which mapped to 2019-nCoV, and qPCR analysis showed 
that the viral load increased from day 1 to day 3 (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). 
Viral particles in ultrathin sections of infected cells displayed a typi￾cal coronavirus morphology, as visualized by electron microscopy 
(Extended Data Fig. 6g). To further confirm the neutralization activity 
of the viral IgG-positive samples, we conducted serum-neutralization 
assays in Vero E6 cells using the five patient sera that were IgG-positive. 
We demonstrate that all samples were able to neutralize 100 TCID50
(50% tissue-culture-infective dose) of 2019-nCoV at a dilution of 
1:40–1:80. We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized by 
horse anti-SARS-CoV serum (gift from L.-F. Wang) at dilutions of 1:40; 
however, the potential for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV antibod￾ies needs to be confirmed with anti-SARS-CoV serum from humans 
(Extended Data Table 4).
ACE2 is known to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV14. To determine 
whether 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, we 
conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells that expressed or 
did not express ACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, 
civets, pigs and mice. We show that 2019-nCoV is able to use all ACE2 
proteins, except for mouse ACE2, as an entry receptor to enter ACE2-
expressing cells, but not cells that did not express ACE2, indicating that 
ACE2 is probably the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters cells 
(Fig. 3). We also show that 2019-nCoV does not use other coronavirus 
receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 
4 (DPP4) (Extended Data Fig. 7).
The study provides a detailed report on 2019-nCoV, the likely aetio￾logical agent responsible for the ongoing epidemic of acute respiratory 
syndrome in China and other countries. Virus-specific nucleotide￾positive and viral-protein seroconversion was observed in all patients 
tested and provides evidence of an association between the disease and 
the presence of this virus. However, there are still many urgent ques￾tions that remain to be answered. The association between 2019-nCoV 
and the disease has not been verified by animal experiments to fulfil 
the Koch’s postulates to establish a causative relationship between a 
microorganism and a disease. We do not yet know the transmission 
routine of this virus among hosts. It appears that the virus is becom￾ing more transmissible between humans. We should closely monitor 
whether the virus continues to evolve to become more virulent. Owing 
to a shortage of specific treatments and considering the relatedness of 
2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV, some drugs and pre-clinical vaccines against

SARS-CoV could probably be used to treat this virus. Finally, consider￾ing the wide spread of SARSr-CoV in their natural reservoirs, future 
research should be focused on active surveillance of these viruses 
for broader geographical regions. In the long term, broad-spectrum 
antiviral drugs and vaccines should be prepared for emerging infec￾tious diseases that are caused by this cluster of viruses in the future. 
Most importantly, strict regulations against the domestication and 
consumption of wildlife should be implemented.
Note added in proof: Since this paper was accepted, the ICTV has desig￾nated the virus as SARS-CoV-215; in addition, the WHO has released the 
official name of the disease caused by this virus, which is COVID-1916.

Methods
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Sample collection
Human samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs, blood and BALF 
samples were collected by Jinyintan hospital (Wuhan, China) with 
the consent of all patients and approved by the ethics committee of 
the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Patients 
were sampled without gender or age preference unless indicated. 
For swabs, 1.5 ml DMEM containing 2% FBS was added to each tube. 
The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 2,500 rpm, 
vortexing for 60 s and a standing period of 15–30 min. The superna￾tant from swabs or BALF (no pre-treatment) was added to either lysis 
buffer for RNA extraction or to viral transport medium for isolation 
of the virus. The viral transport medium was composed of Hank’s 
balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) containing BSA (1%), amphotericin 
(15 μg ml−1), penicillin G (100 units ml−1) and streptomycin (50 μg ml−1). 
Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3,000g for 15 min within 
24 h of collection, followed by inactivation at 56 °C for 1 h, and was 
then stored at 4 °C until use.
Virus isolation, cell infection, electron microscopy and 
neutralization assay
The following cell lines were used for virus isolation in this study: Vero 
E6 and Huh7 cells, which were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. All 
cell lines were tested and free of mycoplasma contamination, submitted 
for species identification and authenticated by morphological evalua￾tion by microscopy. None of the cell lines was on the list of commonly 
misidentified cell lines (by ICLAC).
Cultured cell monolayers were maintained in their respective medium. 
The PCR-positive BALF sample from ICU-06 patient was spun at 8,000g
for 15 min, filtered and diluted 1:2 with DMEM supplemented with 
16 μg ml−1 trypsin before it was added to the cells. After incubation at 
37 °C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh culture 
medium containing antibiotics (see below) and 16 μg ml−1 trypsin. The 
cells were incubated at 37 °C and observed daily for cytopathogenic 
effects. The culture supernatant was examined for the presence of virus 
by qRT–PCR methods developed in this study, and cells were examined 
by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-SARSr-CoV Rp3 N 
antibody that was generated in-house (1:1,000). Penicillin (100 units ml−1) 
and streptomycin (15 μg ml−1) were included in all tissue culture media.
Vero E6 cells were infected with the new virus at a multiplicity of 
infection (MOI) of 0.5 and collected 48 h after infection. Cells were fixed 
with 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated 
through a graded series of ethanol concentrations (from 30 to 100%) 
and embedded with epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) of embed￾ded cells were prepared, deposited onto Formvar-coated copper grids 
(200 mesh), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and analysed 
using a 200-kV Tecnai G2 electron microscope.
The virus neutralization test was carried out in a 96-well plate. 
The patient serum samples were heat-inactivated by incubation at 
56 °C for 1 h before use. The serum samples were diluted to 1:10, 1:20, 
1:40 or 1:80, and then an equal volume of virus stock was added and 
incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Diluted horse 
anti-SARS-CoV serum or serum samples from healthy individuals 
were used as control. After incubation, 100 μl mixtures were inocu￾lated onto a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate for 1 h. Each 
serum was assessed in triplicate. After removing the supernatant, the 
plate was washed twice with DMEM medium. Cells were incubated 
with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 3 days. Subsequently, 
the cells were checked for cytopathogenic effects.
RNA extraction and PCR
Whenever commercial kits were used, the manufacturer’s instructions 
were followed without modification. RNA was extracted from 200 μl 
of samples with the High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche). RNA was eluted in 
50 μl of elution buffer and used as the template for RT–PCR.
For qPCR analysis, primers based on the S gene of 2019-nCoV were 
designed: RBD-qF1, 5′-CAATGGTTTAACAGGCACAGG-3′; RBD-qR1, 
5′-CTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCACG-3′. RNA extracted as described 
above was used for qPCR using the HiScript II One Step qRT–PCR 
SYBR Green Kit (Vazyme Biotech). Conventional PCRs were also 
performed using the following primer pairs: ND-CoVs-951F, 5′-TGT￾KAGRTTYCCTAAYATTAC-3′; ND-CoVs-1805R, 5′-ACATCYTGATAN￾ARAACAGC-3′. The 20-μl qPCR reaction mix contained 10 μl 2× One 
Step SYBR Green mix, 1 μl One Step SYBR Green Enzyme mix, 0.4 μl 
50× ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.4 μl of each primer (10 μM) and 2 μl 
template RNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 50 °C for 
3 min, 95 °C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 10 s 
and 60 °C for 30 s, and a default melting curve step in an ABI 7500 
Real-time PCR machine.
Serological test
In-house anti-SARSr-CoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits were developed using 
SARSr-CoV Rp3 N protein as antigen, which shared more than 90% 
amino acid identity to all SARSr-CoVs2
. For IgG analyses, MaxiSorp 
Nunc-immuno 96-well ELISA plates were coated (100 ng per well) over￾night with recombinant N protein. Human sera were used at a dilution 
of 1:20 for 1 h at 37 °C. An anti-human IgG HRP-conjugated monoclonal 
antibody (Kyab Biotech) was used at a dilution of 1:40,000. The OD 
value (450–630 nm) was calculated. For IgM analyses, MaxiSorp Nunc￾immuno 96-well ELISA plates were coated (500 ng per well) overnight 
with anti-human IgM (μ chain). Human sera were used at a 1:100 dilu￾tion for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with an anti-Rp3 N 
HRP-conjugated antibody (Kyab Biotech) at a dilution of 1:4,000. The 
OD value (450–630 nm) was calculated.
Examination of ACE2 receptor for 2019-nCoV infection
HeLa cells transiently expressing ACE2 were prepared using Lipofectamine 
3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 96-well plate; mock-transfected cells 
were used as controls. 2019-nCoV grown in Vero E6 cells was used for 
infection at a MOI of 0.5. APN and DPP4 were analysed in the same way. 
The inoculum was removed after absorption for 1 h and washed twice 
with PBS and supplemented with medium. At 24 h after infection, cells 
were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) 
for 20 min at room temperature. ACE2 expression was detected using 
a mouse anti-S tag monoclonal antibody and a FITC-labelled goat anti￾mouse IgG H&L (Abcam, ab96879). Viral replication was detected using 
a rabbit antibody against the Rp3 N protein (generated in-house, 1:1,000) 
and a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Abcam, ab6939). Nuclei 
were stained with DAPI (Beyotime). Staining patterns were 
examined using confocal microscopy on a FV1200 microscope (Olympus).
High-throughput sequencing, pathogen screening and genome 
assembly
Samples from patient BALF or from the supernatant of virus cul￾tures were used for RNA extraction and next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) using BGI MGISEQ2000 and Illumina MiSeq 3000 sequencers. 
Metagenomic analysis was carried out mainly based on the bio￾informatics platform MGmapper (PE_2.24 and SE_2.24). The raw 
NGS reads were first processed by Cutadapt (v.1.18) with minimum 
read length of 30 base pairs. BWA (v.0.7.12-r1039) was used to align 
reads to a local database with a filter hits parameter of 0.8 FMM 
((match + mismatch)/read length ≥ fraction] value and minimum 
alignment score of 30. Parameters for post-processing of assigned 
reads were set to a minimum size normalized abundance of 0.01, 

minimum read count of 20 and were otherwise set to default param￾eters. A local nucleic acid database for human and mammals was 
used to filter reads of host genomes before mapping reads to the 
virus database. The results of the metagenomic analysis were dis￾played as pie charts using Microsoft Office 2010. NGS reads were 
assembled into genomes using Geneious (v.11.0.3) and MEGAHIT 
(v.1.2.9). PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to fill gaps in 
the genome. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was per￾formed to determine the 5′-end of the genomes using a SMARTer 
RACE 5′/3′ kit (Takara). Genomes were annotated using the Clone 
Manager Professional Suite 8 (Sci-Ed Software).
Phylogenetic analysis
Routine sequence management and analysis was carried out using 
DNAStar. The sequence alignment of complete genome sequences 
was performed using MAFFT (v.7.307) with default parameters. The 
codon alignments of full-length S and RdRp gene sequences were con￾verted from the corresponding protein alignments by PAL2NAL (v.14); 
the protein alignments were created by Clustal Omega (v.1.2.4) using 
default parameters. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were 
generated using RAxML (v.0.9.0) with GTR+G substitution model and 
1,000 bootstrap replicates.
