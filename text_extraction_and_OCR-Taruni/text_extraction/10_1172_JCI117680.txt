Abstract
Neutrophil adhesion and direct cytotoxicity for cardiac myo￾cytes require chemotactic stimulation and are dependent
upon CD18-ICAM-1 binding. To characterize the potential
role of IL-8 in this interaction, canine IL-8 cDNA was cloned
and the mature recombinant protein expressed in Esche￾richia coli BL21 cells. Recombinant canine IL-8 markedly
increased adhesion of neutrophils to isolated canine cardiac
myocytes. This adhesion resulted in direct cytotoxicity for
cardiac myocytes. Both processes were specifically blocked
by antibodies directed against CD18 and IL-8. In vivo, after
1 h of coronary occlusion, IL-8 mRNA was markedly and
consistently induced in reperfused segments of myocardium.
IL-8 mRNA was not induced in control (normally perfused)
myocardial segments. Minimal amounts of IL-8 mRNA were
detected after 3 or 4 h of ischemia without reperfusion.
Highest levels of induction were evident in the most ischemic
myocardial segments. IL-8 mRNA peaked in the first 3 h of
reperfusion and persisted at high levels beyond 24 h. IL-8
staining was present in the inflammatory infiltrate near the
border between necrotic and viable myocardium, as well as
in small veins in the same area. These findings provide the
first direct evidence for regulation of IL-8 in ischemic and
reperfused canine myocardium and support the hypothesis
that IL-8 participates in neutrophil-mediated myocardial
injury. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:89-103.) Key words: myo￾cardial infarction - myocardial reperfusion injury - neutro￾phils * cell adhesion molecules * chemotaxis
Introduction
Substantial evidence indicates that chemotactic stimulation of
CD18 adhesive functions is important in the mobilization of
neutrophils into previously ischemic myocardium and in the

extension of myocardial injury associated with reperfusion ( 1,
2). This concept is based on reductions in neutrophil accumula￾tion and postreperfusion injury by CD1 lb and CD18 blocking
mAbs in models of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (3-
10), as well as on the activation of complement after myocar￾dial ischemia (11-16). Furthermore, postischemic lymph is
chemotactic for neutrophils as a result, at least in part, from
CSa formation (16, 17). In addition to complement, other che￾motactic factors likely play a role in this process (1). This is
evidenced by recent studies where soluble complement receptor
type- 1, a potent inhibitor of both classic and alternative comple￾ment pathways, has failed to consistently inhibit neutrophil ad￾hesion in reperfused myocardium (18, 19).
We have shown previously that endothelial cell monolayers
incubated with postreperfusion cardiac lymph produced all the
factors necessary to induce adhesion of unstimulated neutrophils
(20, 21). Furthermore, when carefully observed under phase￾contrast optics, a high percentage of neutrophils migrated be￾neath the endothelial monolayers, suggesting that activation of
neutrophil motility had also occurred. Evidence provided by
recent studies under similar in vitro conditions supports the
conclusion that interleukin-8 (IL-8) may be directly responsible
not only for inducing unstimulated neutrophil adhesion, but also
for their transendothelial migration (22, 23). IL-8 has potent
chemotactic and proinflammatory functions (22-25) and is
more selective for neutrophils than C5a, platelet-activating fac￾tor, or leukotriene B4 (24, 26). It appears that IL-8 is also
important in activation of integrin adhesiveness and in directing
leukocyte migration in vivo (24, 25, 27). While the importance
of IL-8 in models of ischemia and reperfusion has been recently
suggested by the ability of anti-IL-8 antibodies to reduce lung
parenchymal injury (28), the participation of IL-8 in similar
models in the myocardium has not been explored. In this report
we seek to (a) characterize the role of recombinant canine IL￾8 in neutrophil activation, adhesion, migration, and adhesion￾dependent reactive oxygen formation; and (b) establish the oc￾currence of IL-8 in post-reperfusion inflammation after coronary
occlusion. The results in vitro demonstrate that IL-8 directly
activates adhesion events and supports adhesion-dependent
functions of the canine neutrophil. Our results also demonstrate
that myocardial reperfusion initiates rapid induction of IL-8 in
the previously ischemic tissue. Thus, IL-8 may mediate activa￾tion of neutrophil adhesiveness and motility in the context of
myocardial reperfusion.

polysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Reverse transcription protocols were performed with 3 /ig of total RNA
in each sample. After first strand synthesis primed with oligo dt, aliquots
of the reverse transcription reactions were amplified with the following
primers: 5' primer, 5 '-GTGTCAACATGACIrCCAAACTG-3', 3'
primer 5 '-CTTCAAAAATATCTGTACAACCTT-3'; at a final concen￾tration of 0.25 1M. PCR was performed with 5 U of Taq polymerase
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for 30 cycles of: 940C, 30 s; 550C, 30
s; 720C, 60 s. The resulting 290-bp amplified fragment was purified,
cloned in pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced.
This PCR product was used to screen an oligo dt-primed cDNA library
prepared from LPS-stimulated canine jugular vein endothelial cells
(CJVEC)' in the A ZAP II vector (Stratagene). Screening was per￾formed by plaque filter hybridization methods (29). Filters were hybrid￾ized in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights,
IL) at 650C for 2 h and then washed with 1 xSSPE, 0.5% SDS at 650C
for 20 min followed by 0.5xSSPE, 0.5% SDS at 650C for 20 min.
Isolated cDNA clones were purified and rescued in pBluescript SK￾using the in vivo excision method. The complete nucleotide sequence
of both strands of one clone (dIL-8-18) was determined using a combi￾nation of automated DNA sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer
(model 373A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the dideoxy￾nucleotide termination method (30). DNA sequences were analyzed
using the suite of programs within EUGENE and SAM, as supported
by the Molecular Biology Information Resource (Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston, TX).
Synthesis of recombinant canine IL-8. Two canine IL-8 coding se￾quences were amplified in PCR reactions; one encoding an 80-amino
acid protein starting at Ala23, a second encoding a 75-amino acid
protein starting at Val28. Both have a Met start codon added to the
amino terminus. The primers were: 5' primer (80) 5'-GTGGATATC￾AAGCTTCATATGGCAGTTCTGTCAAGAGTCAGT-3': 5' primer
(75) 5 '-GTGGATATCAAGCTTCATATGGTCAGTTCAGAACTT￾CGATGCC-3'; 3' primer, 5 '-GTGGATATCTCTAGAGGATCCTCA￾TTATCACGGATCTTGTllCTC-3'. These primers were used to am￾plify the above sequences using 1 ng dIL-8- 18 plasmid, 0.5 ,uM primer,
and 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) for 30
cycles of: 94°C, 30 s; 42°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60 s. The resulting 287- and
272-bp amplified fragments were purified (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth,
CA), digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified by agarose gel electro￾phoresis, and ligated with an NdeI-BamHI-digested, modified pET3a
expression plasmid (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The sequences of
isolated clones were verified by sequence analysis using Taq dyedeoxy￾terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems) and an automated
sequencer.
Canine IL-8 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells
in two, 1-liter shake flasks. Expression was induced by overnight incuba￾tion with 500 MM isopropyl /3-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 g before lysis. Cells
were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% PMSF.
After lysis, the sonicated material was centrifuged, and the pellet was
resuspended in buffer containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M guani￾dine-HCl, 50 mM D1T. The resolubilized protein was dialyzed against
buffer containing 0.05 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 M urea, and loaded onto
a S-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mM Mes (pH 5.0), 8 M urea.
After loading, the column was washed with 50 mM Mes (pH 5.0) to
remove the urea followed by an additional wash with buffer containing
50 mM Mes (pH 5.0), 500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing canine IL￾8 were subjected to overnight refolding in the presence of 1 mM oxidized
glutathione and 2 mM reduced glutathione. Extent of refolding was

monitored by Poros analytical chromatography. Refolded dog IL-8 was
subsequently purified by chromatography using C4 semi-preparative
reverse phase HPLC using a 0-100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1%
TFA/H20. Fractions containing canine IL-8 were pooled and examined
for purity by SDS-PAGE, analytical C4 HPLC, amino acid analysis,
and NH2-terminal sequencing.
Determination of purity of canine IL-8. To confirm the identity of
the purified protein and to assess the purity of the isolated protein
species, electrospray ionization spectra were obtained. The electrospray
ionization spectra were acquired by a single quadrupole mass spectrome￾ter (Trio 2000; Fisons Instruments, Inc., Danvers, MA). The mass spec￾trometer was calibrated using horse heart myoglobin and scanned from
m/z 600 to 1,600 in 10 s. The lyophilized samples were dissolved to
their final concentration in a 1% acetic acid, methanol/water ( 1:1, vol/
vol) mixture, which was also used as the electrospray carrier solvent.
Protein solutions at concentrations of 10-50 pmol/Ml were injected (10
Ml) into the ion source at a flow rate of 10 l1/min.
Western analysis ofcanine IL-8. For analysis with mAb 5E7, chemo￾kine protein samples (2 Mg) were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS poly￾acrylamide gel and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose matrix. After
blocking, the blot was transferred to milk buffer containing 2.5 Mg/ml
5E7 monoclonal antibody. After removing unbound antibody, the blot
was developed by standard procedures. For analysis with a rabbit poly￾clonal antibody anti-canine IL-8 0.5-ig chemokine samples were elec￾trophoresed on a 14% tricine SDS polyacrylamide gel (31) and trans￾ferred to Immobilon-P filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After
blocking, the filter was incubated with the polyclonal anti-IL-8 (5 Mg/
ml) for 1 h. The filter was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence
Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Corp.).
Neutrophil isolation. Canine neutrophils were isolated from citrate
anticoagulated venous blood using techniques described previously for
the isolation of human neutrophils (32). This yielded a preparation of
cells > 95% neutrophils with > 99% viability. These cells were sus￾pended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered balanced salt solution (PBS)
and used within 4 h.
Isolation of CJVEC. These cells were obtained by modification of
the method of Ford (33), as described previously (21). For adhesion
assays, second passage cells were obtained by scraping, seeded onto
gelatin-coated (0.1%) 25-mm round cover glasses, and grown to con￾fluence.
Isolation ofcardiac myocytes. Previously described procedures were
used (20, 21, 34). Myocytes were isolated by retrograde perfusion of
the canine myocardium through an aortic cannula. Perfusion with low
calcium solution was followed by the addition of collagenase (120 U/
ml, type III; Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ). Prepara￾tions with a viability of > 80% were used in incubation experiments.
Cells were used within 5 h of isolation.
Shape change and chemotaxis assays. Shape change was determined
on canine neutrophils as described previously ( 16, 17, 35 ). Suspensions
of canine neutrophils were exposed to canine IL-8 for 5 min at 37°C and
then fixed in 1.0% glutaraldehyde. The percentages of cells assuming
spherical, ruffled, bipolar, and uropod configurations were then deter￾mined visually by phase-contrast microscopy ( X 100). The percentages
of cells displaying ruffled, bipolar, and uropod configurations were
added and reported as percent responsive neutrophils. For all antibody
blocking studies, canine IL-8 and mAb 5E7 were coincubated for 20
min at room temperature before addition of cells.
Chemotactic migration was determined using the leading front assay
as previously described (35). Haptotactic migration was assessed by a
modification to the method of Rot (36). For both assays blind-well
chemotaxis chambers (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) and 3-am pore
filters (Millipore Corp.) were used. Neutrophils were allowed to migrate
for 45 min at 37°C. The filters were removed, stained, and examined
under oil. The distance migrated was determined as the distance between
the upper surface of the filter and the leading front. For haptotaxis
assays, gradients were preformed across the filters by filling the bottom
wells with the attractants, filling the top wells with PBS, and incubating
the chambers at 370C for 30 min. After incubation, the chambers were

disassembled, and the filters were taken out and thoroughly washed in
PBS to remove the attractant not bound to the filter. The filters were
then air dried and placed into a new chemotactic chamber.
mAbs. The murine anti-IL-8 mAbs 5E7 (IgGl) and 5G9 (IgGl)
were made by immunizing Balb/c mice subcutaneously and intraperito￾neally each with 40 Mg of human monocyte IL-8 in complete Freund's
adjuvant. Mice were boosted 2 wk later with 20 Mg IL-8 each as above
except in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. At 4 wk a second boost of 40
Mg IL-8 in PBS was administered via the tail vein and splenocytes were
harvested 3 d later. 1.25 x 108 splenocytes were fused with 3.0 X 107
SP2/o myeloma cells by standard polyethylene glycol fusion. Hybrid￾oma supernatants were tested for the production of IL-8 binding antibod￾ies by ELISA with a 96-well plate coated overnight with 50 MIl of a 1
Mg/ml solution of human IL-8. Clones EU3.5E7 and EU3.5G9 were
found to be producing an antibody that bound to the human IL-8 and
were subcloned by serial dilution. The anti-CD-l lb mAb MY904
(Fab' )2 was obtained from Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis,
IN). The anti-CD18 mAb R15.7 (IgGl) (34) was supplied by Dr.
Robert Rothlein (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridge￾field, CT).
Immunofluorescense flow cytometry. Cell surface expression of
CD 1 b was assessed using saturating concentrations of the mAb MY
904 (Fab' )2 (IgG,) (Lilly Research Laboratories). Binding was de￾tected with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody labeled with FITC (Zymed
Labs, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) capable of detecting (Fab')2
fragments. Analysis was carried out with a FACScan® (Becton Dickin￾son Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA). Results are ex￾pressed as increase in mean fluorescence intensity.
Canine neutrophil adhesion to CJVEC monolayers and protein￾coated glass. Confluent monolayers of CJVEC on glass coverslips were
inserted into adhesion chambers, and the adhesion of isolated canine
neutrophils was visually determined under static conditions as pre￾viously described (33, 37). For adhesion to protein-coated glass, 25-
mm round coverslips were spotted with 10 M1 of a Keyhole Limpet
hemocyanin (KLH) solution (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in
PBS for 30 min at 37°C, rinsed in PBS by dipping six times, and
mounted into the adhesion chambers as described previously (35, 38).
The percentage of neutrophils remaining attached to the CJVEC or to
the KLH-coated glass was determined as described previously (35, 38).
Canine neutrophil-myocyte adhesion. Adhesion was determined vi￾sually under static conditions as described previously (20, 34). Myo￾cytes were incubated in the presence or absence of human recombinant
IL-1f3 (Genzyme Corp., Boston, MA) for 3 h at 37°C before addition
of the neutrophils. Isolated canine neutrophils were prestimulated with
canine IL-8 or I % zymosan-activated dog serum (ZAS) prepared as
described ( 17) before use in adhesion assays.
Adhesion-dependent oxidation. Adhesion-dependent oxidation was
determined as described previously (39). Isolated myocytes were prein￾cubated with human recombinant IL-ll as described above. Subse￾quently, they were loaded with 2',7'dichlorodihydrofluorescein diace￾tate (DCFH; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 20 min at 37°C
and washed twice. DCFH-loaded myocytes were then suspended with
canine neutrophils stimulated with canine IL-8 or ZAS, under identical
circumstances to the protocol used for adhesion. Fluorometric studies
were performed by monitoring cellular fluorescence in a fluorometer
(Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments, Norwalk, CT; excitation 488 nm and
emission of 521 nm).
Ischemia-reperfusion protocols. Healthy mongrel dogs ( 15-25 kg)
of either sex were surgically instrumented as described previously (21 ).
Anesthesia was induced intravenously with 10 mg/kg methohexital so￾dium (Brevital; Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN) and maintained
with the inhalational anesthetic Isoflurane (Anaquest, Madison, WI). A
midline thoracotomy provided access to the heart and mediastinum,
and cannulation of the cardiac lymph duct was then performed (17).
Subsequently, a hydraulically activated occluding device and a Doppler
flow probe ( 17, 21 ) were secured around the circumflex coronary artery
just proximal or just distal to the first branch. Indwelling cannulae,
placed in the right atrium, left atrium, and femoral artery, allowed blood
sampling and pressure monitoring as needed.
The animals were allowed to recover for 72 h before occlusion.
Ischemia-reperfusion protocols were performed in awake animals as
described ( 17, 21). Coronary artery occlusion was achieved by inflating
the coronary cuff occluder until mean flow in the coronary vessel was
zero, as determined by the Doppler flow probe. At the end of 1 h, the
cuff was deflated and the myocardium was reperfused. Reperfusion
intervals ranged from 1 to 24 h. Analgesia was accomplished with
intravenously administered pentazocine (Talwin; Winthrop Pharmaceu￾ticals, New York) 0.1-0.2 mg/kg.
After the reperfusion periods, hearts were stopped by the infusion
of saturated potassium chloride and removed from the chest for sec￾tioning from apex to base into four transverse rings - 1 cm in thickness.
Tissue samples were isolated from infarcted or normally perfused myo￾cardium based on visual inspection. Myocardial segments were immedi￾ately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue samples were homogenized
and processed in a blinded fashion for RNA isolation and analysis.
Duplicate samples fixed in 10% buffered formalin were processed for
blood flow determinations using radiolabeled microspheres as described
previously (21, 40, 41). All animal protocols were approved by the
appropriate institutional review committee and conform to institutional
guidelines.
Northern blots. RNA was isolated from myocardial tissue segments
or cultured CJVEC using the acid guanidinium phenol chloroform proce￾dure (42). RNA (5-20 jg) was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels
containing formaldehyde, then transferred to a nylon membrane (Gene
Screen Plus; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) by standard proce￾dures (21, 29). Loading of RNA was monitored using ethidium bromide
staining as well as by probing the nylon membranes with human glycer￾aldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Membranes were hy￾bridized in QuikHyb rapid hybridization buffer (Stratagene), containing
- 1 x 106 dpmlml random hexamer 32P-labeled canine IL-8 cDNA
probe at 680C for 2 h. The canine IL-8 cDNA probe consisted of a
1 ,100-bp fragment from the 3' untranslated region, obtained by restric￾tion enzyme digestion from the isolated cDNA clone. After washing,
filters were exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Corp.) for 12-24 h.
Analyses of radioactivity were performed on a blot analyzer (Betascope
603; Betagen, Waltham, MA) by scanning the blots for 90 min.
Polyclonal antibody to canine IL-8. A polyclonal antibody to canine
IL-8 was made by immunizing rabbits with a 26-amino acid peptide
from the COOH-terminal portion of canine IL-8. The peptide extended
from Lys69 to Lys94 and it was synthesized in a peptide synthesizer
(model 430; Applied Biosystems), using Fmoc chemistry according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Purity of the peptide was assessed by
amino acid analysis and HPLC. Three chinchilla rabbits were immu￾nized. Each received 170 pg of peptide with 170 Mg of complete
Freund's adjuvant divided into six intradermal sites. Rabbits were
boosted according to the same protocol on days 9, 15, and 22. On day
29, the rabbits were killed. The serum was collected and in the first
step desalted on Sephadex G25 column. The resulting peak was applied
on DEAE Trisacryl M anion exchange column. The antibody-containing
fraction eluted with the flow-through peak at three times the sample
volume.
Immunohistochemistry. Samples were obtained immediately after
the heart was removed from the animal and consist of 2-3-mm-thick
sections extending transmurally through the anterior and posterior papil￾lary muscles and the interventricular septum, and adjacent sections were
taken from the midmyocardium parallel to the surface. These were
placed in plastic embedding molds (Miles Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL)
with OCT compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN) and rapidly frozen in
isopentane cooled to its freezing point with liquid nitrogen. Blocks were
transferred to dry ice and stored at -70°C. Frozen sections 6-mm-thick
were cut in a microtome-cryostat at -20°C, fixed for 15 min in ethanol
at -20°C, and then air-dried. Sections were pretreated for 30 min with
1% sodium metaperoxidate and for 30 min with 0.1 M ammonium
chloride, then incubated for 20 min with 1% goat serum to block nonspe￾cific absorption. Sections were incubated with the polyclonal rabbit

antibody anti-IL-8 at 15 /sg/ml for 1 h at 370C. After rinsing in PBS,
the slides were incubated for 30 min with biotinylated, affinity-purified
goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min. The slides were rinsed in PBS and
incubated for 45 min in ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) and then rinsed five times in PBS. Peroxidase was detected using
diaminobenzidine, and the reaction product was intensified by rinsing
with 1% osmium tetroxide. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin
and eosin.
Results
Library screening. A cDNA library that was prepared from
poly (A) + RNA extracted from CJVEC which had been stimu￾lated for 3 h with bacterial LPS was screened. 20 clones hybrid￾ized and contained inserts of 1.2-1.4 kb that upon Southern
blotting demonstrated strong hybridization signals. The com￾plete cDNA sequence of clone dIL-8-18, which appeared to
contain the largest insert, was determined. Nucleotide sequence
analysis revealed that the available canine IL-8 cDNA sequence
is 1,437 bp in length, consisting of a 5' untranslated region, a
single open reading frame of 303 bp, and a 3' untranslated area
of 1,128 bp excluding the poly (A)+ tail (Fig. 1). The open
reading frame begins with the AUG start codon at position 7
and ends with the TGA stop codon at position 310 and encodes
for a 101 -amino acid precursor protein. This canine IL-8 clone
has a short 5' untranslated region. The nucleotide sequences in
the vicinity of the AUG provide the context for translation
initiation and are in agreement with many of the known consen￾sus sequences present in eukaryotes (43, 44). Furthermore, the
canine IL-8 initiation motif AACAUGA is identical to the hu￾Figure 1. (A) Complete cDNA
and deduced amino acid sequence
of canine IL-8. Both strands of
cDNA clone dIL-8- 18 were com￾pletely sequenced using a combi￾nation of automated DNA se￾quencing and the dideoxynucleo￾tide termination method (see
Methods). The sequence has been
submitted under accession number
U10308. The NH2-terminal Met is
underlined and the consensus
polyadenylation hexamer is dou￾ble underlined. (B) Protein se￾quence comparison. Canine, hu￾man (58), porcine (46), and rab￾bit (47) IL-8 amino acid
sequences are compared. Identical

man, porcine, and rabbit IL-8 homologues (45-47). After the
NH2-terminal methionine, there is a positively charged 3-amino
acid region that includes a lysine at amino acid position 4,
followed by 15 hydrophobic residues, typical of n and h regions
of a signal peptide (48). Based on the location of the NH2-
terminal cleavage sites of human IL-8, the amino terminus of
mature canine IL-8 could be at Glu2l, Ala23, or Val28 (49,
50). Two putative signal peptidase cleavage sites that follow
the -3, -1 rule were identified (48). These sites occur between
residues 20 and 21, or 22 and 23, and would be compatible
with two of the human IL-8 NH2-terminal forms. There is,
however, significant evidence that IL-8 undergoes further NH2-
terminal processing after cleavage of the signal peptide (49,
50). In the case of human IL-8, a pentapeptide is proteolytically
cleaved by thrombin in the presence of neutrophils (51) . Similar
processing would give rise to a mature canine IL-8 with an
amino terminus at Val28. This mature protein (Val28-ProlOl)
does not contain N-linked glycosylation sites. There are four
cysteine residues accounting for 5% of the total amino acids.
These are predicted to be organized in two intrachain disulfide
bridges. In addition, the first two cysteine residues of the mature
protein conform to the CXC family characteristic. The 3' un￾translated region of canine IL-8 is of similar length to that
reported for human, porcine, and rabbit IL-8. It contains the
eukaryotic consensus polyadenylation hexamer AATAAA
(1416- 1421), followed 16 bp downstream by a poly (A) + tail
(52). A number of sequences that may be related to mRNA
stability are present in the 3' untranslated region of canine 11-

Canine IL-8 displayed significant sequence homology to
human IL-8 at the amino acid level, being 75% identical overall.
It also displayed high levels of amino acid homology to porcine
and rabbit IL-8, being 85 and 80% identical, respectively (45-
47) (Fig. 1 B). All cysteine residues are conserved across the
four species. There is also remarkable similarity with human,
porcine, and rabbit IL-8 in terms of the signal peptide length
and sequence, position of the predicted signal peptidase cleav￾age sites, and total length of the proteins (45-47, 58).
Bacterial expression of canine IL-8. The recombinant pro￾tein was purified and refolded as described in Methods. Of the
two coding sequences amplified, only the one encoding for the
75-amino acid protein starting at Val28 was expressed. The
purified canine IL-8 was further characterized to establish the
authenticity of the cDNA clone and purity of the recombinant
product. To provide estimates of molecular mass, electrospray
ionization spectra were obtained (Fig. 2 A). This technique
allows mass estimation of high resolution and accuracy. The
predicted molecular mass of the 75-amino acid canine IL-8 is
Figure 2. (A) Mass spectra of canine IL-8. Lyophilized sam￾ples of canine recombinant IL-8 were dissolved to their final
concentration in a 1% acetic acid, methanol/water (1:1, vol
vol) mixture, also used as the electrospray carrier solvent.
Protein solutions (10-50 pmol/,ul) were injected (10 M1)
into the ion source at a flow rate of 10 ul/min. Two peaks
that correspond to canine IL-8 with and without the NH2-
terminal methionine are shown. (B) Western analysis of ca￾nine 11L-8 with 5E7. Chemokine protein samples (2 jig) were
electrophoresed on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel and subse￾quently blotted onto nitrocellulose matrix. The blot was
probed with mAb 5E7 (2.5 pg/ml) as described in Methods.
Designated lanes are as follows: 1, platelet factor 4; 2, canine
1L-8; 3, human 1L-8; 4, human GROa; and 5, molecular size
markers.
8,709 with the NH2-terminal methionine and 8,577 without this
residue. Two peaks were identified with mass estimates of 8,704
and 8,574. Within the 0.1% accuracy expected of this technique,
these estimates correspond to the recombinant canine IL-8 with
and without the NH2-terminal methionine. These findings were
confirmed by NH2-tenrninal sequencing. Both forms of the re￾combinant canine IL-8 are present at almost equal proportions.
The corresponding Western blot performed with a murine
monoclonal antibody to human recombinant IL-8 is shown in
Fig. 2 B. As shown, mAb 5E7 reacts with both recombinant
human and canine IL-8. A dominant band of - 8 kD, corre￾sponding to the monomeric form of both molecules, was demon￾strated. In addition, a 16-kD band corresponding to the dimeric
form of IL-8 was observed in both species. This higher molecu￾lar band was more intense in the preparation of human IL-8.
5E7 did not recognize the related chemokines GROa or platelet
factor 4.

as mAb 5G9, that did not recognize canine IL-8 were used (Fig.
3 C). Stimulation of neutrophils with canine 11L-8 significantly
increased adhesion to monolayers of CJVEC or to KLH-coated
glass in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Canine IL￾8 also increased the cell surface expression of CD11 b on the
neutrophil surface (Fig. 5), as reported previously for human
11L-8 (59).
Exposure of neutrophils to IL-8 resulted in marked increases
in adhesion to cardiac myocytes previously stimulated with IL￾1,f to induce the surface expression of intercellular adhesion
molecule-I (ICAM-1) (Fig. 6 A). Peak adhesion was reached
with 10 nM 1L-8. As shown, levels of adhesion induced by
canine IL-8 were comparable to those observed after ZAS stim￾ulation of the neutrophils. As previously reported, stimulation
of both cell types appeared to be necessary since unstimulated
neutrophils failed to adhere to IL-1-treated myocytes, and en￾hanced adhesion was not observed when 1L-1 was omitted (34).
Adhesion to cardiac myocytes was virtually eliminated when

reaction. Neutrophil-induced myocyte intracellular oxidative

stress was studied using DCFH-loaded myocytes (39). As
shown in Fig. 6 B, increased fluorescence indicating intracellu￾lar oxidation of cardiac myocytes resulting from neutrophil ad￾hesion occurred in response to canine IL-8. Fluorescence of
DCFH-loaded myocytes was detected within 15 min after the
addition of IL-8-stimulated neutrophils. In agreement with the
adhesion data, fluorescence peaked when neutrophils were stim￾ulated with 10 nM IL-8. In addition, peak fluorescence levels
observed with IL-8 stimulation were similar to those evident
when ZAS was used as chemotactic agent. Fluorescence was
also completely inhibited by mAbs R15.7 and 5E7 (data not
shown).
As previously shown for human IL-8 (36), canine IL-8
induced neutrophil migration to haptotactic (filter-bound) and
chemotactic (soluble) gradients (Fig. 7 A). The haptotactic
gradient of canine IL-8 had similar potency and efficacy as the
chemotactic gradient. As was the case with shape change, 5E7
almost completely inhibited the extent of neutrophil migration
(Fig. 7 B).
Induction of IL-8 mRNA in CJVEC. Regulation of canine
IL-8 mRNA was first studied in vitro in cultured CJVEC. The
message was identified in Northern blot analyses as a 1.5-kb
hybridizing band (Fig. 8). Studies of the kinetic induction of
IL-8 mRNA by TNF-a revealed marked increases after 30 min.
Peak levels were reached after 3 h of stimulation. Steady state
levels of IL-8 mRNA remained elevated above baseline levels
even after 18 h of stimulation. This was consistent with the
effects of TNF-a on human endothelial cells (60, 61 ). Minimal
levels of 11L-8 mRNA were occasionally detectable as a single
species in untreated control samples. No differences in baseline
expression were noted in samples of cells analyzed within the
same experiment. In addition to the 1.5-kb dominant band, a
much weaker higher molecular weight band of - 3.5-kb was
evident in analyses of stimulated but not unstimulated CJVEC.

specific stimulatory activity for IL-8 mRNA was present in
preischemic lymph or in lymph collected during the occlusion
period (Fig. 9 A ). Factors in cardiac lymph responsible for the
induction of IL-8 mRNA on CJVEC appeared to be produced
or released as a consequence of myocardial ischemic injury.
This conclusion is based on the fact that lymph obtained from
an experimental animal that underwent coronary occlusion and
reperfusion but did not develop a myocardial infarction did not
elicit IL-8 mRNA when incubated with CJVEC (Fig. 9 B).
Peak stimulatory activity for IL-8 in postischemic lymph was
found within the first 3 h of reperfusion (Fig. 9 C).

cardiun. To study the regulation of IL-8 mRNA in ischenmic
and reperfused myocardium, we examined Northern blots of
RNA isolated from myocardial segments characterized for their
blood flow during coronary occlusion as described previously
(21 ). Representative experiments in two animals subjected to
h of coronary occlusion and I h of reperfusion are shown in
Fig. 10. In the experiment illustrated in lanes C-G, the animal
sustained a large infarct. Significant induction of IL-8 mRNA
in all ischemic and reperfused myocardial tissue segments was
observed (lanes D-G). Highest levels of induction were present
in segments demonstrating the lowest levels of blood flow
(lanes D and F). whereas IL-8 mRNA was not detectable in
normally perfused anterior ventricular wall segments as shown
in lane C. Contrasting findings were evident in the experiment
illustrated in lanes A and B, which demonstrated no evidence
of significant ischemia after the same coronary occlusion and
reperfusion protocol. In this experiment, IL-8 message was not
detected in any of the segments analyzed.

performed after h of coronary artery occlusion and h of
reperfusion, a wide spectrum of induction of IL-8 mRNA was
observed. Four separate experiments are shown, each one identi￾fied by brackets at the bottom of Fig. 11. Concurrent assessment
of myocardial blood flow indicated that the degree of ischernia
was a major determinant regulating the levels of induction of
IL-8 mRNA. The highest levels of induction in each separate
experiment were generally evident in the most ischemic myo￾cardial segments (Fig. I 1. lanes C, F. I, and 0). IL-8 mRNA
was detected in segments with diminished levels of blood flow
(Fig. 1, lanes B, E, G, J, K, and M), but was less intense than
observed with more severe blood flow reductions. Furthermore,
a graded response that closely paralleled the degree of ischemia
in each individual segment was present. This concept is further

Figure 9. Stimulation of IL-8 in CJVEC by postischemic cardiac lymph.
Aliquots of lymph were obtained from separate experiments before or
during coronary artery occlusion and at designated times during reperfu￾sion. In the experiment shown in A the experimental animal was success￾fully infarcted, whereas in the experiments shown in B the animal was
not, despite undergoing identical occlusion protocol. Cultured CJVEC
monolayers were preincubated with a 1:7 dilution of cardiac lymph or
TNF-a (30 U/ml, B, lane I or 10 U/ml, B, lane 6) for 3 h at 37°C in
separate T-75 flasks. Cells were then used in Northern analyses loading

present in the experiment shown in lanes A and B. Tissue segments were
isolated from infarcted posterior papillary muscle and infarcted posterior

for ischemic and reperfused, or I' to indicate segments within the distribu￾tion of the occluded artery but without evidence of infarction. RNA was

of this message (Fig. 11, lanes D, H, and L), with the exception
of lane A, where minimal induction was noted. Three additional
control segments for each of these four experiments were ana￾lyzed and failed to demonstrate measurable levels of IL-8
mRNA (data not shown).
Regulation of myocardial IL-8 mRNA: relationship to time
of reperfusion. To directly evaluate the relationship of time and
induction of IL-8 mRNA in ischemic and reperfused myocar￾dium, a series of coronary occlusion experiments with varying
intervals of reperfusion was compared. In all three experiments
shown in Fig. 12, the circumflex artery was occluded for 1 h,
and then the myocardium was reperfused for 1, 3, or 24 h.
Myocardial infarctions were evident in all three experiments.
A time-dependent induction of IL-8 mRNA was observed in
ischemic segments analyzed among each of these three animals.
When comparing segments with similar degrees of blood flow
reduction, steady state levels of IL-8 mRNA peaked within
the first 3 h of reperfusion. IL-8 mRNA remained consistently
elevated after 24 h of reperfusion, at levels as high as after the
first hour of reperfusion. Expression of this message after 3 or
24 h of reperfusion was present only in ischemic and reperfused
segments, whereas IL-8 mRNA was not evident in normally
perfused anterior wall segments. Maximal induction was present
in the most ischemic segments at all reperfusion intervals stud￾ied. Consistent with the observations after 1 h of reperfusion,
experimental animals that were occluded and did not develop
an infarct failed to demonstrate measurable induction of IL-8
mRNA at time periods up to 24 h (data not shown).
Regulation ofIL-8 mRNA in the myocardium by reperfusion.
The role of reperfusion in the induction of myocardial IL-8
mRNA was directly assessed in Fig. 13. In contrast to the isch￾emic and reperfused segments, nonreperfused segments after 3
or 4 h of ischemia demonstrated only minimal induction of IL￾8 mRNA, despite severe ischemia. The level of induction seen
in the absence of reperfusion never exceeded 5-10% of equally
ischemic segments with reperfusion. These findings are repre￾Figure 11. Regulation of myocardial IL-8 mRNA after 1 h of
occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion. Four separate experiments are
shown. Each separate experiment is identified by brackets at the
bottom of the figure. A myocardial infarction was present in all
four experiments. Myocardial segments were isolated from in￾farcted posterior papillary muscle and infarcted posterior wall
(labeled I, for ischemic and reperfused), or normally perfused
anterior wall myocardium (labeled C, for control). RNA was
isolated from each segment and processed for Northern blots and
blood flow determinations as described in Methods. 20 tig of
total RNA was loaded in each lane, shown by ethidium bromide
staining (bottom). Endocardial blood flow determinations are
indicated for each myocardial segment. The top of the figure
shows a graphical representation of the signals obtained by analy￾sis of the radioactivity measured by a blot analyzer in each lane.
Designated lanes are as follows: lanes A, D, H, and L, normally
perfused anterior wall; lanes B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, M, and 0,
infarcted posterior papillary muscle or infarcted posterior ventric￾ular wall myocardium; lane N, normally perfused segment within
the circumflex artery distribution. The migration position of the

sentative of four experiments analyzed after 3 or 4 h of continu￾ous ischemia without reperfusion.
Development of anti-canine IL-8 polyclonal antibody. To
evaluate the expression of IL-8 in the same experimental ani￾mals, an antibody capable of immunostaining myocardial sec￾tions was needed. A specific polyclonal antibody was made by
immunizing rabbits with a synthetic 26-amino acid peptide
based upon the deduced amino acid sequence of the carboxy
terminus of canine IL-8 (see Methods). This polyclonal anti￾body recognized recombinant canine IL-8 in Western blots,
without reacting with the related chemokine GROa (Fig. 14).
A much weaker band was also observed for human IL-8
(Fig. 14).
Distribution ofIL-8 in ischemic and reperfused canine myo￾cardium. Immunohistochemical studies of the IL-8 antigen in
reperfused myocardium consistently showed distinct staining of
the leukocytes which were present near the border between
necrotic and viable myocardium (Fig. 15 A). Staining of leuko￾cytes was restricted to their cytoplasm. Staining of venular en￾dothelium was also observed and was more often present in the
vicinity of the inflammatory infiltrate than elsewhere. Positive
staining of endothelium within small venules was often associ￾ated with the presence of neutrophils within the lumen or sur￾rounding the vessel (Fig. 15 B). Staining of arterial endothelium
was not observed. After 1 or 3 h of ischemia without reperfusion
staining for IL-8 was rarely seen (data not shown).
Discussion
Leukocyte migration into reperfused myocardium occurs in re￾sponse to molecular events that signal injury or inflammation.
In this report, we provide direct evidence that 11L-8 is induced
in the myocardium as a result of experimental ischemia and
reperfusion. These findings introduce a novel molecular signal
present in reperfused myocardium and extend our previous ef￾98 Kukielka et al.

forts to unravel the molecular pathophysiology of the inflam￾matory response that follows myocardial reperfusion injury.
Structural and functional comparisons demonstrate canine
and human IL-8 to be homologous proteins. Canine IL-8 shares
75% identity with human IL-8. In addition to this high level of
homology, there are also remarkable similarities in terms of
signal peptide length and sequence, position of the predicted
signal peptidase cleavage sites, and total length of proteins. All
cystein residues are conserved across both species, including
those that conform to the CXC family configuration. In vitro,
canine IL-8 has chemotactic and shape change dose-response
profiles for canine neutrophils analogous to those of human IL￾8 for both human and canine neutrophils (65, 66). As shown
previously for human IL-8, canine IL-8 induces changes in the
surface expression and function of CD1 lb/CD18 and is capable
of eliciting neutrophil migration not only in solution but also
when bound to the surface of a chemotaxis filter (36, 59).
Finally, epitope similarities were established by specifically
blocking the neutrophil stimulation induced by canine IL-8 as
well as by antigenic recognition in Western analysis by a mono￾clonal antibody made against human IL-8. Based on these obser￾vations, we conclude that the clone dIL-8-18 encodes for the
canine homologue of human IL-8.

Representative experiments in two animals subjected to 3 (left, lanes
A-D) or 4 (right, lanes J-O) h of ischemia without reperfusion are
shown. Each separate experiment is identified by brackets at the bottom
of the figure. Levels of IL-8 mRNA induced by ischemia alone are
compared to the levels induced by 1 h of occlusion and 3 h of reperfusion
(lanes E-I). All three animals sustained a large myocardial infarction.
Myocardial segments are labeled C for control and I for ischemic or
ischemic and reperfused, depending upon the experiment. RNA was
isolated from each segment and analyzed using Northern blots and blood
flow determinations as described in Methods. 20 Mg of total RNA was
loaded in each lane, as shown by the ethidium bromide staining (bot￾tom). Endocardial blood flow determinations are indicated for each
myocardial segment. The top of the figure shows a graphical representa￾tion of the signals obtained by analysis of the radioactivity measured
by a blot analyzer in each lane. The migration position of the 18S rRNA
band is indicated. Equal loading was also verified by probing the mem￾brane with human GAPDH (data not shown).
In these studies we documented that cellular events initiated
by reperfusion of the previously ischemic myocardium consis￾tently induced IL-8 mRNA in all segments that had been sub￾jected to a significant degree of ischemia, while sparing the
normally perfused control segments. The magnitude of blood
flow reduction during coronary occlusion appeared to be a major
determinant regulating the levels of IL-8 mRNA. The highest
levels of induction were evident in the most ischemic myocar￾dial segments. Furthermore, a graded response that closely par￾alleled the degree of ischemia was found in segments with mild
and moderate reductions of blood flow. In animals in whom
coronary occlusion did not affect ischemia because of extensive
collateral blood flow, IL-8 mRNA induction was not detected.
These findings were consistently evident regardless of the reper￾fusion interval. They are also in agreement with the observations
of Dreyer et al. (8) who showed that the degree of neutrophil
accumulation was inversely proportional to the regional myo￾cardial blood flow during ischemia, and with our recent findings

demonstrating the induction of ICAM-1 in myocardial segments
with similar blood flow reduction profiles (21). Thus, there
appears to be a quantitative and qualitative relationship between
the degree of myocardial injury and the observed changes in
IL-8 mRNA.
Kinetic analyses of the temporal sequence of steady state
levels of IL-8 mRNA in ischemic myocardium after coronary
reperfusion demonstrated remarkable similarities to the tempo￾ral sequence deduced by studying IL-8 mRNA induction on
endothelial cells when incubated with postreperfusion lymph
taken at similar time periods. These findings suggest the pres￾ence of soluble factors which induce IL-8 mRNA that may be
operative with similar kinetics in vivo as well as in vitro as a
result of myocardial reperfusion. Neutrophils and monocytes
are known to produce IL-8 in response to a variety of soluble
stimuli (24, 26), and leukocyte influx is markedly augmented
by reperfusion; which may explain the observed relationship of
IL-8 induction to myocardial reperfusion. Of particular interest
is the observation that C5a induces IL-8 on both neutrophils and
monocytes (67). An alternative mechanism for IL-8 production
involves signaling through a membrane protein that participates
in the adhesive process. Recent evidence has implicated L￾selectin as a molecule capable of transducing signals through a
pathway that leads to transcription of IL-8 and TNF-a in neutro￾phils (68). This finding is particularly relevant since L-selectin
has been suggested to play an important role in neutrophil accu￾mulation during myocardial reperfusion (69). Endothelial cells
are also capable of producing IL-8 when stimulated by a variety
of soluble factors including TNF-a and IL-1p6 (24, 61), as well
as in response to anoxia (70). It is interesting to note that IL￾8 mRNA induction in neutrophils appears to last only a few
hours, while levels of IL-8 mRNA on endothelial or mononu￾clear cells in response to cytokine stimulation remain elevated
well beyond 24 h (24, 62). Hence, it is conceivable that differ￾ent cell types are responsible for the production of IL-8 at
different times during reperfusion and that a number of induc￾tion mechanisms may be involved in this process.
While it has been suggested that the constitutively expressed
ICAM-1 on endothelial cells may be sufficient to support CD18-
dependent transendothelial migration of neutrophils (21, 71),
the requirement exists for a mechanism to direct neutrophil
activation and transmigration to the injured areas of myocar￾dium. Huber et al. (22) have shown that neutrophil transmigra￾tion across cytokine-stimulated endothelial cell monolayers oc￾curs in response to a surface-bound IL-8 produced by the endo￾Aik

gradient was disturbed by adding soluble IL-8 to the apical
compartment. Hechtman et al. (72) showed that while intrader￾mal injections of IL-8 induce neutrophil accumulation, intravas￾cular administration does not. In a recent study Rot et al. (73)
revealed the presence of IL-8 binding sites present only on the
luminal surface of postcapillary and collecting venules and
small veins in the skin. These are the sites from which neutro￾100 Kukielka et al.

phils transmigrate into tissues and are analogous to those venu￾lar structures supporting neutrophil accumulation and transen￾dothelial migration in reperfused myocardium (21). In our
model, while IL-8 mRNA was not induced in normally perfused
segments, expression of 1L-8 mRNA in myocardial segments
had a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation with the
observed degree of ischemia and with our previous determina￾tions of neutrophil sequestration in reperfused myocardium, re￾spectively. High levels of IL-8 protein were evident early in
reperfusion, at a time when the rate of neutrophil accumulation
in reperfused myocardium is maximal (8). Based on our results,
it is reasonable to propose that 11L-8 constitutes a molecular
signal that could contribute to the mechanism of neutrophil
localization in early reperfusion.
IL-8 induced in the myocardium during reperfusion can
serve as a stimulus for activation of neutrophil adhesiveness
and cytotoxic behavior. Under static conditions and within a
range of concentrations that increased the surface expression of
CD18, canine 1L-8 induced a concentration-dependent increase
in the adhesion of canine neutrophils to KLH-coated glass (a
CDIlb/CD18 substrate) and to unstimulated endothelial cells.
A novel finding was the induction of 1L-8-stimulated neutro￾phil adhesion to cardiac myocytes through a CD18-dependent
mechanism. These observations are compatible with our previ￾ous studies demonstrating that neutrophil adhesion to cardiac
myocytes requires chemotactic stimulation (34, 37) and that
under conditions of ZAS stimulation this adhesion also requires
CD18. Under similar stimulatory conditions, 11L-8 induced neu￾trophil cytotoxicity for cardiac myocytes, as evident by intracel￾lular oxidation of DCFH (39). Previous studies in our labora￾tories have shown that only conditions that promoted neutro￾phil-myocyte adhesion resulted in fluorescence of DCFH￾loaded myocytes (39), and that myocyte contracture consis￾tently occurred a few seconds after the peak of fluorescence
(39). Moreover, both adhesion and fluorescence depend primar￾ily on CD11b/CD18 and ICAM-1 interactions (34, 37, 39).
Thus, 11L-8 may participate in the neutrophil-induced myocardial
injury by inducing ligand-specific adhesion to cardiac myocytes,
which in turn is required for a compartmented transfer of reac￾tive oxygen species to cardiac myocytes (39).
Taken together these findings confirm our hypothesis that
IL-8 is induced in reperfused myocardium and underscore the
potential role of IL-8 in neutrophil activation and transmigration
in previously ischemic myocardium. It is interesting to speculate
that, under circumstances where blood flow may preclude the
establishment of a stable soluble chemotactic gradient, a sur￾face-bound chemoattractant may represent an effective mecha￾nism of chemotactic agent presentation and of neutrophil activa￾tion. Parenchymal injury after lung ischemia and reperfusion
has been prevented with the administration of anti-1L-8 anti￾bodies (28). It remains to be seen whether the same protection
would occur in the heart. The results in this report are also
consistent with the interpretation that sequential and overlap￾ping patterns of chemoattractant generation, with varying de￾grees of cell specificity, are likely to occur in vivo after reperfu￾sion of the previously ischemic myocardium.
