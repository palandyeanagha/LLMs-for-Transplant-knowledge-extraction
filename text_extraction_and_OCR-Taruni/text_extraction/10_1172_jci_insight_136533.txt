Introduction
Lung transplantation remains the only viable option for patients with chronic respiratory failure from end￾stage lung diseases like cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and emphysema. However, long-term 
survival after lung transplantation continues to be the worst among all solid organ transplants, with a 
10-year survival of only 20% (1). The predominant cause of these poor outcomes is the high incidence of 
chronic graft failure arising from immunologically mediated graft injury and progressive fibrosis termed 
chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) (2). Among patients with CLAD, a particularly poor prognosis 
is associated with a recently characterized subtype designated as restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) (3). 
RAS develops in approximately 30% of the patients with CLAD, and it is characterized by a restrictive pat￾tern of decline in lung function and a fulminant course, which leads to respiratory failure and death (3–5).
The histopathological presentations of RAS are more complex and varied than those of bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome (BOS), the other common presentation of CLAD. While bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) 
or fibrotic remodeling limited to the small airways is a predominant feature of BOS, a spectrum of histologic 
features have been described in RAS lungs (3, 6, 7). These include more acute presentations of diffuse alveolar 
damage (DAD) and intraalveolar fibrinous exudates, as well as chronic end-stage fibrosis and pleuroparenchy￾mal fibroelastosis (PPFE) (5, 8–10). Pleural fibrosis extending into the lungs along the interlobular septa, as 
well as fibrosis emanating from the bronchovascular bundles, is seen pointing to a more fulminant fibropro￾liferative graft response. Lymphocytic aggregates in the perivascular and peribronchial regions, macrophage 
accumulation in the airspaces, and presence of B cells have been described (10, 11). This diverse spectrum of 
pathologies in human RAS specimens, which are obtained at various stages of disease pathogenesis, suggests 
Understanding the distinct pathogenic mechanisms that culminate in allograft fibrosis and 
chronic graft failure is key in improving outcomes after solid organ transplantation. Here, we 
describe an F1 → parent orthotopic lung transplant model of restrictive allograft syndrome 
(RAS), a particularly fulminant form of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), and identify 
a requisite pathogenic role for humoral immune responses in development of RAS. B6D2F1/J 
(H2-b/d) donor lungs transplanted into the parent C57BL/6J (H2-b) recipients demonstrated a 
spectrum of histopathologic changes, ranging from lymphocytic infiltration, fibrinous exudates, 
and endothelialitis to peribronchial and pleuroparenchymal fibrosis, similar to those noted in the 
human RAS lungs. Gene expression profiling revealed differential humoral immune cell activation 
as a key feature of the RAS murine model, with significant B cell and plasma cell infiltration 
noted in the RAS lung allografts. B6D2F1/J lung allografts transplanted into μMt–/– (mature B 
cell deficient) or activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)/secretory μ-chain (μs) double-KO 
(AID−/−μs−/−) C57BL/6J mice demonstrated significantly decreased allograft fibrosis, indicating a key 
role for antibody secretion by B cells in mediating RAS pathology. Our study suggests that skewing 
of immune responses determines the diverse allograft remodeling patterns and highlights the need 
to develop targeted therapies for specific CLAD phenotypes.

an evolution from subacute immune-mediated allograft injury and rejection to fibrosis. Patients with persistent 
donor-specific antibodies (DSA) have been shown to be at a higher risk for RAS (12), and RAS is the dominant 
form of allograft failure seen in patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) (13, 14). However, investi￾gations of pathogenic mechanisms in this distinctive pleuroparenchymal fibrotic remodeling of allografts have 
been limited by the lack of a representative animal model (15).
In this study, we describe a murine model of orthotopic single lung transplantation that demonstrates 
an evolution along the spectrum of histopathological changes that mark RAS in human lung allografts. 
Investigations of this model highlight immune pathways key to skewing of the remodeling response to 
RAS and establish an obligatory role for antibody production by B cells in the allograft fibrogenesis in RAS 
after lung transplantation.
Results
Murine orthotopic F1 → parent (B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J) lung transplants develop allograft fibrosis characteristic of RAS.
Mismatch of immune cells by transfer of T lymphocytes from parent → F1 mice have been used in the fields of 
graft versus host disease (GVHD), and connective tissue diseases in which different spectra of immune activa￾tion and disease severity have been noted depending on the specific parent strain used with the same F1 mouse 
(16–18). We have previously used this mismatch of F1 and parent mice and have established that transplantation 
of B6D2F1/J (H2-b/d) F1 lungs into DBA/2J (H2-d) mice leads to the development of pathology characteristic 
of BO (19). To investigate whether pathology is induced by transplantation of these F1 lungs into the other par￾ent mouse, left lungs from B6D2F1/J (H2-b/d) donor mice were transplanted into C57BL/6J (H2-b) recipients. 
While isografts (B6D2F1/J → B6D2F1/J) were ventilated and had a normal appearance on gross examination, 
allogeneic grafts (B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J) appeared shrunken (Figure 1A). To assess whether there is develop￾ment of chronic allograft rejection and fibrosis, hydroxyproline assay and morphometric collagen measurements 
in lung sections stained with Picrosirius red were used (Figure 1B). Significantly higher collagen by hydroxypro￾line and morphometric analysis was noted in the allografts at both days 28 and 40 after transplant, as compared 
with the isografts (Figure 1B). Masson’s trichrome collagen staining demonstrated significant pleural thickening 
and fibrosis, a pathognomonic feature of RAS, in all allografts (Figure 1, B and C). Fibrosis was noted to extend 
along the subpleural interstitium and the bronchovascular bundles (Figure 1C). Along with pleural and intersti￾tial fibrosis, increased elastin expression and PPFE has been reported in late stages of RAS (8, 10). This led us to 
evaluate elastin expression in the allografts. We observed increased elastin staining in the pleura and interstitium 
in approximately one-third of the lung allografts at day 40 after transplantation (Figure 1D). Elastin levels in the 
homogenized transplanted lungs were also measured by ELISA, with 2-fold higher levels of elastin noted in the 
allografts compared with the isografts (Figure 1E).
B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J allografts demonstrate a spectrum of histopathological characteristics of RAS. To investi￾gate the temporal evolution of histopathologic changes, lung allografts were studied at various time points after 
transplantation (days 7, 14, 28, 40, and 60). Histologic patterns were identified and scored by a pulmonary 
pathologist using a scoring algorithm as described in Methods. Representative images are shown in Figure 2, A 
and B. Quantitative scoring of the severity of pathologic features is presented as a heatmap in Figure 2C. Per￾centage incidence based on absence or presence of a specific histologic feature is shown in Supplemental Table 
1 (supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.136533DS1).
As shown in Figure 2A, the predominant finding at day 7 was the presence of moderate acute rejection 
with perivascular and peribronchial lymphocytic infiltration. Mild cellular infiltration was also noted in 
the pleura. By day 14, progression of pleuritis with mesothelial hyperplasia and plasma cell infiltration 
was evident. Another key histology feature noted at this time point was the presence of patchy fibrinous 
exudates in the alveoli, characteristic of acute fibrinous pneumonia. Persistent acute cellular rejection with 
lymphocyte infiltration surrounding blood vessels and airways continued over time, with some lungs also 
demonstrating distinct clusters of lymphoid cells at day 28. Endothelialitis with infiltration by lymphop￾lasmacytic infiltrate and endothelial cell damage was noted to be a prominent feature at this time point 
(Supplemental Figure 1). Another feature of day 28 histology was the appearance of foamy macrophages 
in the alveoli, concomitant with a decrease in fibrinous exudates. Decreasing cellularity with increasing 
fibrosis was noted in the pleural space, as evidenced by pale acellular expansion. Fibrotic expansion was 
also evident along the bronchovascular bundles by day 28. By day 40, all transplanted lungs demonstrated 
pleural fibrosis, along with peribronchial fibrosis. Along with substantial fibrosis, acute rejection and areas 
of fibrinous exudates were still noted in the majority of the grafts, demonstrating presence of multiple

Figure 2. B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J transplant lungs demonstrate a spectrum of histopathological characteristics of RAS. (A) Summary of the histologic 
characteristics on allograft lungs examined on posttransplant days 7, 14, 28, and 40. Mononuclear cell infiltration of the vessels (acute rejection), airways 
(lymphocytic bronchiolitis), and pleura (pleuritis) was noted at day 7. Day 14 allografts demonstrated further increase in pleural thickness with plasma 
cell infiltration and evolving fibrosis. Another prominent feature was development of patches of intraalveolar fibrinous exudates. Fibrosis along the 
bronchovascular bundles and pleura with occasional fibroblastic plugs in the airway lumen was a key feature at day 28. Alveolar spaces were marked 
by presence of foamy macrophages. Endothelialitis with evidence of plasma cell infiltration was noted beginning at day 28, and plasmacytic vasculitis 
marked day 40 allografts. Other findings at this time point included severe pleural fibrosis, along with interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis.

histologic patterns at a given time point (Figure 2B). Plasma cell infiltration of the pleura and the intersti￾tium persisted at day 60, which was associated with further increase in fibrosis in the pleural space. Thus, 
B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J allografts demonstrated the spectrum of characteristic histologic patterns that 
have been described in human RAS lungs (5, 8–10).
Gene expression profiling reveals differential humoral immune cell activation as a key feature of the RAS murine 
model. The disparate pathology of the B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J combination, which had histopathologic 
features of RAS compared with the previously described BO pathology noted in B6D2F1/J → DBA/2J 
allografts (19, 20), led us to investigate the global gene differences between the 2 models over time 
by using Affymetrix microarray analyses. Data collected previously from the B6D2F1/J → DBA/2J 
allografts (BOS, unpublished observations) were normalized and analyzed, along with expression data 
from B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J allografts (RAS). We compared biological processes gene ontology (GO) 
enrichments between the 2 models at days 14, 28, and 40 (Supplemental Table 2). Venn diagrams demon￾strating the overlap between significantly enriched GO terms in each of 2 experimental conditions is 
shown in Figure 3A and Supplemental Table 2. The top GO terms, ranked by significance, which were 
enriched in the RAS model and not the BOS model for each time point, are presented in Table 1. Humor￾al immune responses mediated by circulating immunoglobulins was the top GO term at day 14 after 
transplantation, with B cell signaling and antigen processing related pathways showing preponderance 
at this stage. Phagocyte recognition, angiogenesis, vascular development, muscle development, and com￾plement activation were among the top GO terms ranked by P value in RAS at day 28, consistent with 
the observed macrophage infiltration and fibrotic remodeling at this time point. Phagocyte recognition 
continued to be among top enriched GO terms in RAS at day 40. GO terms related to humoral immune 
responses, B cell activation, B cell receptor signaling, and complement activation demonstrated statisti￾cally significant upregulation of gene expression at all 3 time points in the RAS model (Table 2). Volcano 
plots for differential expression data from day 28 for these key GO terms are shown in Figure 3B. To 
further investigate humoral responses, we measured serum levels of DSA in isografts (B6D2F1/J → 
B6D2F1/J) and in BOS (B6D2F1/J → DBA/2J) and RAS (B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J) lung allografts. 
High levels of donor-specific serum IgM and IgG were noted in RAS transplants. These levels were sig￾nificantly higher than those noted in both isograft and BOS serum samples. No significant increase above 
isografts was noted in BOS samples (Figure 3C).
Infiltration with B cells and plasma cells characterizes lung allografts in a murine RAS model. Flow cytometry was 
used to investigate the infiltrating immune cell populations in the RAS allografts (Figure 4A). Increases in both 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were noted in allografts, as compared with isografts. We also observed significantly high￾er numbers of CD19+ B cells, plasma cells (CD19–
CD138+), and plasmablasts (CD19+CD138+) in the allografts. 
Immunostaining with anti-CD3 antibody confirmed T cell infiltration at the bronchovascular bundles (Figure 
4B). T lymphocytes were the predominant cell in the lymphoid aggregates, and T cell infiltration of the pleura 
was also noted. Immunostaining for B220 demonstrated clusters of B220+ B cells in the sub-bronchial location 
in close proximity to the smooth muscle bundles and the mesenchymal cells. B cell infiltration was also noted in 
the subendothelial and subpleural spaces on day 28 (Figure 4B). CD138+ plasma cells were noted predominantly 
along the bronchovascular bundles and in the pleura (Figure 4B). GL7+ expression, a marker characteristic of 
germinal centers, was also noted in the cellular aggregates localized in the peribronchial region of the RAS day 
28 allografts (Figure 4C). To investigate if this evidence for humoral cell activation is unique to RAS, infiltrating 
B cell population in the allograft were compared between the BOS and RAS models. Significantly lower CD19+, 
CD19+CD22+, and CD19+CD138+ B cell populations were noted in the BOS model as compared with RAS 
allografts by flow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 2A). Immunostaining with CD138 revealed a stark difference 
between the 2 allografts, with no significant plasma cell infiltration in the BO lungs (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) was noted in some allografts. Bronchovascular bundles demonstrated persistent rejection with epithelial injury. 
Photomicrographs represent 6–9 mice in each group and were validated by a board-certified pathologist. Lung explants marked for histology at 28 and 
day 40 overlap with samples shown in Figure 1. New transplants were performed for day 7 and 14 after transplant. Scale bar: 80 μm (original magnifica￾tion, 200×). (B) Photomicrograph of the entire RAS allograft lung with Masson’s trichrome collagen staining (in blue) is shown at day 40. Fibrosis is seen 
emanating from the pleura and along the bronchovascular bundles. Concomitant histology features included intraalveolar fibrinous exudates and acute 
rejection. BVBF, bronchovascular bundle fibrosis; PPFE, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis; PF, pleural fibrosis. (C) Quantitative representation of the 
histologic characteristics and pathology scores over time after transplant. Average score divided by the highest score at each time point, is presented as

Requisite role of humoral immune responses in pathogenesis of RAS. To further elucidate the role of B cells 
in the development of RAS pathology and lung allograft fibrogenesis μMt–/– (mature B cell deficient) recip￾ient mice were used. B6D2F1/J lung allografts transplanted into μMt–/– C57BL/6J mice were compared 
with B6D2F1/J allografts transplanted into WT C57BL/6J mice at day 28 after transplantation. Gross 
examination demonstrated ventilated allografts in μMt–/– C57BL/6J mice (Figure 5A). Flow cytometry 
confirmed decreased B cells in the lung allografts into μMt–/– C57BL/6J recipient mice, as compared with 
the RAS allografts, but no significant difference was noted in the number of CD3+ T cells between the 
2 groups (Figure 5B). Hydroxyproline assay was used to compare total collagen expression in isografts, 
allografts transplanted into WT recipients, and allografts transplanted into μMt–/– hosts. Significantly low￾er levels of collagen were noted in allografts from μMt–/– recipients as compared with the WT recipient 
with levels comparable with those in the isografts (Figure 5C). Trichrome staining confirmed attenuated 
allograft fibrosis in allografts placed into μMt–/– recipients, with decreased pleural as well as interstitial, 
peribronchial, and perivascular collagen expression (Figure 5D). Other RAS-associated histologic patterns 
were scored by a blinded pulmonary pathologist in μMt/– and WT RAS allografts using a scoring algorithm 
described in Methods. μMt–/– C57BL/6J recipients demonstrated significant reduction in fibrinous exu￾dates, macrophage infiltration, and endothelialitis with no significant difference noted in acute rejection 
scores (Figure 5E). A conspicuous feature was the presence of preserved endothelium in μMt–/– recipients 
and the absence of subendothelial plasma cell aggregates despite significant perivascular T cell infiltration 
(Supplemental Figure 1). Immunostaining for B cells revealed only some scattered B220+ cells in allografts 
that had been transplanted into μMt–/– mice (Figure 5F). Those B cells in the allografts into μMt–/– recipients 
were confirmed to be of donor origin by H2-d staining and flow cytometry (data not shown). Consistent 
with previous reports from our laboratory (21), we did not observe donor-specific IgM or IgG antibodies in 
the serum of μMt–/– allograft recipients (Figure 5G).
In addition to their role in antibody production and secretion, B cells can regulate immune respons￾es through antigen presentation or cytokine production (22, 23). To further investigate whether B cells 
mediate the pathogenesis of RAS through secretion of antibodies, we used activation-induced cytidine 
deaminase (AID)/secretory μ-chain (μs) double-KO (AID−/−μs
−/−) mice as allograft recipients. In these mice, 
B cells demonstrate a normal diverse repertoire of receptors but are unable to synthesize secretory immu￾noglobulins and exhibit a deficiency in plasma cells (24, 25). Notably, similar to our observations after 
transplantation of B6D2F1/J F1 allografts into μMt–/– B6 recipients, AID−/−μs
−/− hosts did not develop the 
fibrosis that we observed in WT recipients (Figure 6, A and B). Also, the extent of lung injury was mark￾edly decreased and fibrinous exudates were not detected (Figure 6B). Costaining for club cells with club 
cell secretory protein (CCSP) and myofibroblasts with α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was performed in 
WT, μMt–/–, and AID–/–μs
–/– recipients to investigate if disruption of the mesenchymal epithelial trophic unit 
is dependent upon B cells in the RAS model (Figure 7). Substantial loss of club cells was noted on days 
14 and 28 in the RAS allografts (Figure 7). In stark contrast, however, CCSP expression was preserved in 
allografts that were placed in μMt–/– and AID–/–μs
–/– recipients.
Discussion
The primary cause of death after the first year of lung transplantation is chronic graft failure arising from 
fibrotic remodeling of the allograft subjected to repeated alloimmune and nonimmune insults (2). Small 
airways are a principal target of chronic allograft rejection, with BO being the most common histolog￾ic manifestation. However, a more robust form of fibrosis with involvement of the pleural, airway, and 
interstitial compartments is seen in RAS, a recently recognized phenotype of CLAD associated with par￾ticularly poor outcomes (5). Clinical studies have offered insight into physiological and histologic features 
of RAS, but pathogenic mechanisms leading to its development remain to be elucidated. In this study, by 
identifying an allogeneic mismatch combination in the murine orthotopic lung transplant model, which 
mimics histopathological changes of RAS, we demonstrate that humoral immune activation is critical in 
skewing the graft injury and remodeling responses toward a RAS phenotype. We provide the first evidence 
to our knowledge for a requisite role for B cells and secretory immunoglobulins in the development of RAS 
differentially expressed (DE) genes and P value for each GO term are also reported in Table 1. n = 4 per group per time point. (C) Serum alloantibody

and offer key insights into the temporal evolution of allograft fibrogenesis — findings that have significant 
implications in clinical management of these patients.
A key finding of our study is the demonstration that humoral immune responses are requisite in the 
pathogenic evolution of RAS features. We have previously used F1 → parent mouse lung transplants to 
model BO and have demonstrated that B6D2F1/J donor lungs transplanted into parent DBA/2J mice 
demonstrate evolution from moderate lymphocytic infiltration to BO, with fibrosis and injury primarily 
confined to the bronchovascular bundles (19). The development of RAS features after transplanting the 
same F1 mouse into the other parent mouse (C57BL/6) pointed to differences in alloimmune responses 
between the 2 strain combinations. These findings have precedence in the fields of GVHD and auto￾immune connective tissue diseases where transplantation of parent lymphocytes into F1 mice is used 
and different immune activation and disease phenotypes have been observed between F1 mice receiv￾ing the 2 parent cells (16–18). Global genome-wide comparison of the 2 models in our study revealed 
humoral immune response pathways as being differentially enriched in the RAS murine model, with 
significant upregulation of the genes in B cell activation pathways persisting over time in the RAS 
lungs. These findings were further substantiated by findings of marked B cell and plasma cell infiltra￾tion in RAS allografts and the presence of circulating DSA in the serum. Patients with persistent DSA 
are at a higher risk for developing CLAD and, more specifically, RAS (13, 14). RAS is the dominant 
form of allograft failure seen in patients with AMR (11), and explants from patients with RAS often 
demonstrate the presence of lymphoid follicles with B cells (11). While these studies have suggested 
a link between humoral immune responses and RAS, investigations of pathogenic mechanisms that 
drive this distinctive allograft pathology have been limited by the lack of a representative animal model 
(15). Our studies using this newly described model of RAS demonstrate a requisite role for humoral 
immunity in this aggressive form of CLAD presentation. Decreased allograft fibrogenesis was noted 
in RAS allografts transplanted into recipient lacking B cell (μMt–/–) or antibody secretion (AID–/–μs–/–) 
in our studies. Significant decreases in endothelialitis, fibrinous exudates, and macrophage infiltration 
were also seen in B cell–deficient mice, suggesting a role for humoral cell activation in the development 
of these histologic features. However, it is important to note that understanding of clinical CLAD 
phenotypes in human lung transplant recipients is still evolving, with underlying complex pathogenic 
mechanisms that cannot be fully emulated by murine models. Therefore, while our data support a more 
personalized approach to immunomodulation based on clinical and histopathologic characteristics, 
future work is needed to improve upon biomarkers of humoral immune activation and to decipher the 
overlap between immunological and clinical phenotypes.
We demonstrate that the B6D2F1/J → C57BL/6J model displays a spectrum of histopathological 
abnormalities noted in human RAS lungs, and we offer insights into the temporal evolution of this 
often fatal condition. The anatomic features of RAS are complex, with many different histologic pat￾terns reported in human lungs that were either biopsied, explanted, or examined at autopsy (5, 8–10). 
Our ability to evaluate the lungs at various time points after transplant offered unique insights into the 
progression of these histopathological changes. Acute rejection with lymphocytic infiltration around 
blood vessels and airways has been commonly described in RAS lungs. We found that lymphocytic

cellular rejection precedes and accompanies the development of other histological manifestations of 
RAS. Perivascular and peribronchial lymphocytic infiltrates were noted early, and significant infiltrates 
were still found at day 40. A unique pattern of lymphocytic aggregates in the bronchovascular bundles 
was identified in a significant number of allografts, similar to what has been described in human lungs 
with RAS. Acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia with fibrin exudates in the alveoli is a well-charac￾terized pathologic feature of RAS (9). Fibrinous exudates were also a prominent feature in our model 
and were noted by day 14. They existed concomitantly with severe acute rejection, B lymphocyte and 
plasma cells infiltration, and endothelialitis but preceded influx of foamy macrophages, which are also 
a well-described feature in RAS lungs. At later time points, a higher degree of infiltration with macro￾phages correlated with decreased fibrinous exudates, suggesting a potential role for these macrophages 
in clearance of fibrin. RAS lungs have a heterogeneous appearance, and similar patterns were found 
in our murine lung allografts with circumscribed areas of fibrinous alveolar exudates, mostly centered 
around bronchovascular bundles, within areas of normal-appearing lung. Patchy ground glass opacities 
are a common early radiographic feature in patients with RAS and could be indicative of such a pro￾cess, perhaps providing an opportunity to intervene before further evolution to fibrosis.
This newly described mouse model of RAS, in combination with our previously established mod￾el of BO (19), offers an opportunity for further mechanistic investigations into the pathogenesis of 
diverse CLAD endotypes. Clinically, CLAD ranges in spectrum from gradually progressive obstructive 
ventilatory defect arising from small airway limited fibrosis of BO, to a rapidly progressive restrictive 
decline pattern induced by robust pleural, interstitial, and bronchovascular bundle fibrosis of RAS (2, 
26). However, the donor, recipient, and environmental factors that contribute to these diverse graft 
remodeling responses have remained elusive. The development of BO-like pathology in DBA/2J recip￾ients versus RAS-like pathology in C57BL/6J recipients of the same F1 donor lung suggests a signifi￾cant contribution of host factors in driving these diverse pathologies. Our present study focused on the 
humoral immune cell activation signature, which was found differentially in RAS versus BO allografts. 
However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms that drive this distinctive immune 
pathway activation in the C57BL/6J versus DBA/2J recipients. The contribution of specific differences 
between these species, such as decreased C5 protein in DBA/2J, need to be explored (27). Further￾more, the pathology of RAS with its distinctive features of fibrinous exudates, macrophage infiltration, 
and endothelial dysfunction overlaps with acute lung injury induced by diverse pulmonary pathogenic 
processes, including viral infections. Therefore, deciphering underlying pathogenic mechanisms in this 
model can also offer insight into lung injury and remodeling responses.
In summary, we describe a murine model of RAS after lung transplantation and demonstrate a critical 
role for humoral alloimmune responses in the pathogenesis of this phenotype. Our studies provide a win￾dow into the temporal evolution of this disease, information which can impact the care of these patients 
and aid in the development of biomarkers and diagnostic criteria. The unique pathogenic evolution of RAS 
and its dependence on B cells suggest the need for phenotype-specific therapeutic approaches.
Methods
Animals and orthotopic lung transplant model. Specific pathogen–free male inbred mice B6D2F1/J (H2-b/d), 
C57BL/6J (H2-b), and μMt–/– mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. AID–/–μs
–/– mice were 
provided by Frances Lund and Troy Randall (University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, USA) and 
Tasuku Honjo (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Both donors and recipients were mice aged between 8 and 
12 weeks, and weighing 24–30 g. Isograft transplants were performed in the B6D2F1/J lungs → B6D2F1/J 
strain combination, and allogeneic transplants were performed in the B6D2F1/J lungs → C57BL/6J 
strain combination for the RAS model and B6D2F1/J lungs → DBA/2J for the BOS model. Orthot￾opic left lung transplantations were performed as previously described (19) using a surgical microscope 
(SZX16-SZX2; Olympus) with 2.1× to 34.5× magnifications for all procedures. Buprenorphine was given 
to recipient mice at the conclusion of the procedure and again every 12 hours until 3 days after transplant.

No immunosuppressive drugs were used. Euthanasia protocols were approved by the University of Mich￾igan IACUC were employed to sacrifice mice at 7, 14, 28, 40, and 60 days after transplantation.
Histopathologic evaluation and IHC. The heart and lung were removed en bloc, fixed in 10% formalin, and 
embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections of 5 μm thickness were stained with H&E to determine lung architec￾ture and with Masson’s trichrome stain (NovaUltra Masson’s Trichrome Stain Kit; IHC World) in order to 
determine the presence of fibrosis in the lesions. Picrosirius red staining was performed as per manufacturer’s 
protocol (NovaUltra Sirius Red Stain Kits; IHC World). From each Picrosirius red–stained section, 4 random 
fields with bronchovascular bundles were imaged with an objective lens magnification at 10× and analyzed 
using ImageJ (ver. 1.52p; NIH) and a slightly modified protocol (28). To maintain uniform image size and 
scale, the scale was set as micrometers (Analyze → Set Scale). In order to isolate red-stained collagen, we 
changed the image type to RGB Stack that yields the gray-scale images of the channels (Image → Type → RGB 
Stack). In the Green channel, we set the threshold at 0–87 (Image → Adjust → Threshold). We recorded the 
area, area fraction, limit to threshold, and display label (Analyze → Measure). This morphometric assessment

of collagen deposition was analyzed on GraphPad Prism (ver. 8.0.0). The pleural thickness was determined by 
measuring the distance between the pleural surface and the mesothelial basement membrane (29), in Masson’s 
trichrome–stained lung sections using ImageJ (ver. 1.52p) on 4 fields per slide (n = 4 representative sections per 
group). The micrograph of the entire lung was used to map some of these histological features.
Grading for histologic features was performed by pulmonary lung transplant pathologists on a scale 
of 0–3 in a blinded manner (30). The ratio of the average score across all samples to the highest score for 
the observed histologic feature was expressed as a heatmap (Figure 2C) with a fold change ranging from 0 
to 1.0, wherein 1.0 represents severe phenotype. A categorical variable of presence of a histologic feature 
(defined as grade > 0) was used to determine percent incidence at each time point (Supplemental Table 1).
IHC staining was performed according to standard laboratory procedures using the following prima￾ry antibodies: rabbit anti-CD3 polyclonal antibody (1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-B220 polyclonal antibody 
(1:400; Abcam), rabbit anti-CD138 (1:20; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and anti-GL7 (1:200; BioLegend), 
mouse anti–α-SMA (1:20; MilliporeSigma), and rabbit anti-CCSP (1:100; Abcam). Imaging was performed 
with an Olympus BX41 microscope connected to an Olympus DP20 camera.
Collagen assay (hydroxyproline) and elastin ELISA. Lung explants were homogenized in 1 mL of PBS; 1 
mL of 12N HCl was added to the homogenate, and the samples were hydrolyzed at 120°C for 24 hours. A 
total of 5 μL of each sample was combined with 5 μL citrate/acetate buffer (238 mmol/L citric acid, 1.2% 
glacial acetic acid, 532 mmol/L sodium acetate, and 85 mmol/L sodium hydroxide) in a 96-well plate. 
A total of 100 μL of chloramine T solution (0.282 g chloramine T to 16 mL of citrate/acetate buffer, 2.0 
mL of n-Propanol, and 2.0 mL double-distilled H2
O) was then added for 30 minutes at room temperature 
followed by 100 μL of Ehrlich’s reagent (2.5 g paradimethylamino benzaldehyde added to 9.3 mL of n-Pro￾panol and 3.9 mL of 70% perchloric acid), and incubation at 65°C for 30 minutes followed. The absorbance 
of each sample was measured at 550 nm. Standard curves for the experiment were generated using known 
concentrations of the hydroxyproline reagent (MilliporeSigma). RAS lung allografts were homogenized in 
PBS, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,621g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were stored in 
–80°C until analyzed for elastin using a modified protocol (31).

Flow cytometry and cell sorting. Multichannel flow cytometric analysis was used to quantify inflam￾matory cell infiltration. Single-cell suspensions enriched for lung leukocytes were obtained from per￾fused and collagenase A–digested lungs and immunostained for 30 minutes with specific conjugated 
antibodies (BD biosciences) or isotype-matched controls at recommended concentrations. Stained 
cells were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis on a BD LR Fortessa (Becton Dickinson), and FlowJo 
software was used to calculate specific immune populations using established gating strategies. Initial 
gates were selected for CD45+ leukocytes, with subsequent gating to identify T cell populations that 
include CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells and to identify B cell populations that include CD19+ B cells, 
CD19+CD22+ activated B cells, CD19+CD138+ plasmablasts, and CD19–
CD138+ plasma cells.
Serum alloantibody titers. Using a previously published protocol (21), 200 μL of PBS with 0.5% BSA 
and 0.02% sodium azide (PBA) containing 2 × 106
 thymocytes of donor origin (DBA/2J for isografts 
and RAS model; C57BL/6J for BOS model) were mixed with 200 μL of serially diluted serum for 1 
hour at 4°C with frequent agitation. After 3 washes with PBA, cells were stained for 30 minutes at 4°C 
with 100 μL of PBA containing 1 μL of polyclonal fluorochrome–conjugated goat anti–mouse IgM (μ
chain specific) or anti–mouse IgG (Fcγ fragment specific) (Jackson ImmunoResearch; catalog 115-116-
075 and 115-095-071, respectively). Cells were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and FlowJo 
software (FlowJo) was used to calculate the median fluorescence intensity.
Microarray analyses. RAS allografts were homogenized, subjected to RNA isolation (74104, 
QIAGEN) and removal of DNA contamination (79254, QIAGEN). The RNA was then subjected 
to Affymetrix Microarray analyses using GeneTitan Mouse Gene 2.1 ST plate with the Affymetrix 
Plus reagent kit. RAS data and data previously collected from BOS models (unpublished, GeneTitan 
Mouse Gene 2.1 ST plate with the Affymetrix Plus reagent kit) were normalized using a robust mul￾tiarray (RMA) average for each gene (32). A weighted linear model designed for microarray analysis 
(33) was fit to the data to compute differential expression statistics between allograft and isograft data 
for each time point for the RAS and BOS transplant models, with year of data collection included in 
the model to account for batch effects. Samples were then weighted based on a gene-by-gene update 
algorithm designed to down-weight chips that are considered less reproducible (34). Probe sets were 
filtered to exclude probes with a variance of less than 0.05 and were limited to probe sets listed as 
“main” by Affymetrix. Differential expression was called using a fold-change threshold of > 2 or < –2 
and a FDR-corrected P < 0.05 (35). The resulting differential expression data were uploaded to iPath￾way Guide (Advaita) for functional enrichment analysis (36). After P values were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using FDR, tables of GO term (37, 38) enrichments for each time point were down￾loaded, including all terms (Supplemental Table 2) and limited to terms found to be enriched in RAS 
but not BOS (Supplemental Table 2). Volcano plots for RAS data were generated for GO:0042113, 
GO:0050853, GO:0002455, GO:0006958 using ggplot2 (ver. 3.2) (39) from tables of unfiltered log fold 
change (logFC) and FDR-adjusted P values for all genes annotated for that GO term at each time point. 
All analysis and graphics were generated in R (ver. 3.4.0 or ver. 3.6.1) unless otherwise indicated. 
Statistical comparisons of the distributions of logFC between a pair of time points was compared using 
paired, 2-tailed t test.
Accession numbers. Microarray data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), with accession no. GSE158057 for data presented in Figure 3.
Statistics. The Student’s 2-tailed t test was used to determine P values when comparing 2 groups. When 
comparing 3 or more groups, 1-way ANOVA was performed with a post hoc Bonferroni test to determine 
which groups showed significant differences, unless otherwise specified. P < 0.05 was considered signifi￾cant using GraphPad Prism (ver. 8.0.0) for Windows 64-bit.
Study approval. All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the University of 
Michigan IACUC.
