Abstract
The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is being broadly studied in clinical trials. Contrary to the early paradigm of cell
replacement and differentiation as a therapeutic mechanism of action, evidence is mounting that the secretions of the
cells are responsible for their therapeutic effects. These secretions include molecules and extracellular vesicles that
have both local and distant effects. This review summarizes the up- and down-regulation of MSC anti-inflammatory,
immune modulating, anti-tumor, and regenerative secretions resulting from different stimuli including: a) hypoxia,
which increases the production of growth factors and anti-inflammatory molecules; b) pro-inflammatory stimuli that
induce the secretion of immune modulating and anti-inflammatory factors; and c) 3 dimensional growth which up
regulates the production of anti-cancer factors and anti-inflammatory molecules compared to monolayer culture.
Finally we review in detail the most important factors present in conditioned medium of MSC that can be considered
protagonists of MSC physiological effects including HGF, TGF-b, VEGF, TSG-6, PGE2 and galectins 1, and 9. We conclude
that there is potential for the development of acellular therapeutic interventions for autoimmune, inflammatory,
and malignant diseases and tissue regeneration from cellular secretions derived from MSCs cultured under the
appropriate conditions.

Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are classically defined as
adherent, non-hematopoietic cells expressing the surface
markers CD90, CD105, and CD73, and lacking the expres￾sion of CD14, CD34, and CD45. The cells also have the
capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes,
and osteocytes in vitro after treatment with differentiation
inducing agents [1]. Although early studies in the late
1960s initially identified MSCs in the bone marrow [2],
more recent studies have reported these cells can be puri￾fied from various tissues such as adipose [3], heart [4],
Wharton’s jelly [5], dental pulp [6] peripheral blood [7],
cord blood [8], and more recently menstrual blood [9-11]
and chorionic villi [12]. Studies of bone marrow showed
that although MSC are the primary cell type that
overgrow in vitro cultures, in vivo MSC are found at a low
ratio compared to other bone marrow mononuclear cells,
specifically, 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 [13]. The physiological
role of MSC still remains to be fully elucidated, with one
hypothesis being that bone marrow MSC act as precursors
for stromal cells that make up the hematopoietic stem cell
microenvironment [14-16].
The first clinical use of MSCs was to accelerate
hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow ablation in
the context of post chemotherapy hematopoietic stem
cell transplant. Lazarus et al. report of the use of auto￾logous, 1–50 × 106 cells in vitro expanded, “mesenchymal
progenitor cells” to treat 15 patients suffering from
hematological malignancies in remission and treatment
showed no treatment-associated adverse effects [17]. In a
subsequent study by the same group, MSC treatment ac￾celerated hematopoietic reconstitution in 28 breast cancer
patients who received high dose chemotherapy with no re￾ported treatment associated adverse effects. The authors
noted that leukocytic and thrombocytic reconstitution

occurred at an accelerated rate as compared to historical
controls [18]. In addition to feasibility, these studies im￾portantly established techniques for ex vivo expansion and
administration.
Demonstration of clinical feasibility and multiple ani￾mal models providing rationale for therapeutic efficacy
of MSCs in non-hematopoietic indications [19-26], gave
rise to a series of clinical trials of MSCs in a wide range
of major diseases including stroke [27-30], heart failure
[31,32], COPD [33] and liver failure [34]. Rare diseases
treated with MSCs such as osteogenesis imperfecta [35],
Hurler syndrome [36], and Duchenne Muscular Dys￾trophy [37] have also been reported.
The ability to generate clinically significant numbers
of well-defined MSCs starting with small clinical sam￾ples, feasible administration without the need for ha￾plotype matching, and excellent safety profile of the cells
has resulted in a broad interest in the clinical use of
MSCs. 402 clinical trials testing MSC are currently
listed on the international registry www.clinicaltrials.gov.
While some trials have demonstrated efficacy of MSC,
full elucidation of mechanisms of action is lacking.
Initial studies demonstrated the ability of certain MSC
types to differentiate into functional tissues that is com￾promised as a result of the underlying pathological. In
spite of the capacity of MSCs to differentiate, evidence is
mounting that much of the disease-modulating activity
of MSCs is due to products secreted by the cells.
This paracrine effect was first observed in heart dis￾ease murine models, in which it was found that bone
marrow (BM) MSCs injected into infarcted hearts did
not differentiate into cardiomyocytes under physiological
in vivo conditions [38]. After intravenous injection the
majority of administered MSCs lodge in lungs and liver
with only a small minority entering the tissue of patho￾logy [39]. Gnecchi hypothesized that clinical effects of
MSCs are not due to cell differentiation, after observing
re-establishment of cardiac function and prevention of
ventricular remodeling in fewer than 72 hours post
injection [40]. The same group went on to show that
MSC conditioned medium alone enhanced recovery of
ischemic cardiomyocytes in vitro [41]. Similarly Lee and
colleagues showed an anti-inflammatory effect and car￾diac infarct size reduction; in spite of the fact that the
majority of the intravenously infused MSCs (human
MSCs in mouse model) were found as emboli in lungs
and few cells migrated to other tissues including the in￾farcted heart [42]. Shabbir et al. demonstrated increased
fractional shortening, and capillary and myocyte density,
as well as attenuated myocyte apoptosis and fibrosis; in a
hamster model of heart failure, in which MSCs were
injected intramuscularly. They also showed that intramus￾cular injection of cell free MSC conditioned medium simi￾larly rescued the failing heart in the same model [43].
Another example of what could be considered purely
the effect of the MSC secretion was demonstrated in a rat
model of complete transection of the spinal cord in which
the termini of the cut cord were covered with fibrin glue
containing human umbilical cord MSCs. The intervention
improved the locomotion and resulted in regeneration of
the spinal cord. It was found that human MSC antigen did
not overlap with the staining for neurons, oligodendro￾cytes or astrocytes, demonstrating that there was a me￾chanism other than MSC differentiation involved in the
spine cord lesion recovery [44]. Recently, Song et al., used
a rat model of overactive bladder and demonstrated that
MSC hardly engraft into damaged bladders, but increased
stem cell gene expression suggesting an MSC paracrine ef￾fect is related to unleashing/mobilizing primitive progeni￾tor cells as a possible mechanism for the long-term/stable
therapeutic efficacy of MSCs [45].
The above-mentioned studies suggest that MSC effi￾cacy may be mediated primarily by secreted factors.
Identification of secreted factors will result in a better
understanding of MSC therapeutic activity, which would
allow not only for generation of MSCs optimized for
efficacy for a potential target, but also the possibility of
administering secreted factors that are naturally or syn￾thetically generated as an alternative to use of live cells.
There are a multitude of culture conditions that allow
MSC to produce differing sets of trophic factors under
biological need to be explored. In this paper, we will
review MSC secreted factors including molecules and
extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) and
culture conditions which can enhance the in vitro pro￾duction of those secreted factors.
MSC therapeutic activity is stimulated by physiological
need
MSCs in standard monolayer culture secrete cytokines,
micro RNA (miRNA), exosomes and microvesicles as a
matter of course. The concept that MSC act as “repair
cells” of the body would imply that MSC do not only
constitutively secrete regenerative factors, but also pro￾duce some factors in response to stimuli. Responsive
production and secretion is an experimental reality.
Hypoxic preconditioning, addition of an inflammatory
stimuli, and growing cells in spheres or tri-dimensional
scaffolds have all been shown to modulate the produc￾tion and excretion of different potential therapeutic fac￾tors. A summary of the effects of culture conditions on
up-regulation of molecular secretion by MSCs and the
up- and down-regulation of effects of MSCs and condi￾tioned medium can be found in Table 1.
MSC stimulation by hypoxia
One of the most common elements of tissue injury is
the presence of hypoxia. Interstitial damage is often

associated with activation of the coagulation cascade,
resulting in areas of hypoxia. It is known that reduction
in oxygen tension in a variety of tissues leads to acti￾vation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α), which
induces transcription of angiogenic genes such as vascu￾lar endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [46-49], as well as
the MSC chemoattractant stromal cell-derived factor 1
(SDF-1) [50,51]. Once MSC migrate to areas of hypoxia,
it has been demonstrated that production of various
therapeutic paracrine mediators is increased. Several
groups have demonstrated the relevance of hypoxia to
MSC growth factor production in vitro. For example, ex￾posure of bone marrow (BM)-MSC to 24 hours of hypoxia
(1% oxygen) resulted in marked induction of VEGF, Fibro￾blast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), Hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), and Insuline like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pro￾duction, in an NF-kappa β dependent manner [52]. The
stimulation of growth factor production by hypoxia is not
specific to BM-MSC and has been demonstrated in MSC
derived from adipose tissue [53], placenta [54], and dental
pulp [55]. Furthermore, hypoxia stimulation of angiogenic
and anti-apoptotic factors such as VEGF, FGF-2, HGF and
IGF-1 has been reported to also occur in MSC from aged
animals, supporting clinical utility [56].
The biological relevance of MSC-secreted growth fac￾tors stimulated by hypoxia can be seen in studies showing
that conditioned media from MSCs grown under hypoxic
but not normoxic conditions endow therapeutic benefit in
animal models. For example, Chang et al. demonstrated
that conditioned medium from hypoxia treated BM-MSC
was capable of restoring neurological function in a rat
model of traumatic brain injury significantly better than
administration of conditioned medium from normoxia
conditioned BM-MSC. Furthermore, they demonstrated
that efficacy was associated with production of HGF and
VEGF, which were involved in the induction of endogen￾ous neurogenesis [57]. In a similar study, the therapeutic
activity of hypoxic and normoxic conditioned BM-MSCs
was compared in a rat massive hepatectomy model. Hypo￾xic conditioned BM-MSCs produced significantly higher
levels of VEGF in vitro as compared to control treated
cells. Furthermore, in vivo administration resulted in
significantly elevated cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear
antigen-positive hepatocytes, liver weight/body weight
ratio, and survival compared with animals that received
normoxia preconditioned BM-MSC. Interestingly, bloc￾kade of VEGF by in vivo administration of anti-VEGF
antibody negated the therapeutic effect of hypoxia [58]. In
a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy it was demon￾strated that administration of hypoxia treated BM-MSC
resulted in superior inhibition of pathological condition
as compared to administration of control BM-MSC.
The therapeutic effect was associated with protection
of cardiomyocytes by increasing the activity of matrix
metalloproteinase-2; inhibiting Transforming growth
factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and caspase-3 and, upregulating
Bcl-2/Bax ratio [59].
Hypoxia not only triggers production of growth factors
from MSC, but also allows the MSC to retain an undif￾ferentiated phenotype, allowing for self-renewal without
differentiation. This may be due in part to the fact that
anatomically, MSCs tend to be found in hypoxic areas of
the body, i.e. adipose tissue and bone marrow are rela￾tively poorly perfused by the circulatory system [48,60].
It was demonstrated in vitro that exposure of BM-MSCs

to hypoxia results in augmented cellular proliferation
and the formation of colonies in the colony-forming unit
assay (CFU-A) and the expression of stemness markers
Rex-1 and Oct-4, thereby suggesting an increase in the
stemness of BM-MSC when exposed to hypoxia [49].
One of the key factors of MSC of relevance to thera￾peutics development is their known anti-inflammatory/
immune modulatory properties. The potency of this effect
is seen in clinical studies showing efficacy of MSC at inhi￾biting lethal, immune-based condition of graft versus host
disease [61-66]. Exposure of MSC to hypoxia has been
shown in several systems to augment immune modulatory
activity. In one example, MSC expression of the trypto￾phan catabolizing enzyme indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase
(IDO) was markedly upregulated in the presence of hy￾poxia [67]. IDO is critical in immune regulation by MSC
in part through induction of T cell anergy [68], and in part
by stimulation of T regulatory cells (T-regs) [69,70]. The
practical relevance of hypoxia-stimulated immune regula￾tion of MSCs is seen in the situation of allogeneic use of
BM-MSCs for stimulation of therapeutic angiogenesis. It
was shown in a recent study that hypoxia-conditioned
BM-MSCs from B6 mice ameliorate limb ischaemia of
Balb/c mice compared to normoxic MSCs. Histological
staining demonstrated that hypoxic BM-MSC have an in￾creased ability to engraft in allogeneic recipients by redu￾cing natural killer cells (NK) cytotoxicity, and decrease the
accumulation of host-derived NK cells when transplanted
in vivo. These allogeneic hypoxia treated BM-MSCs gave
rise to CD31+ endothelial cells and αSMA + and desmin +
muscle cells, thereby enhancing angiogenesis and restoring
muscle structure. Moreover, application of anti-NK anti￾bodies together with normoxic MSCs enhanced angio￾genesis and prevented limb amputation in allogeneic
recipients with limb ischemia, thus demonstrating that the
benefit of hypoxic conditioning was mediated by enhanced
immune modulation in the allogenic setting [71].
In short, hypoxic conditioning of cultured MSCs may
result in increased production and secretion of trophic
factors, augmentation of angiogenic effects, and enhanced
immune modulating activity from the conditioned cells
relative to normoxic culture conditioning.
Inflammatory stimuli
In addition to responding to hypoxia, MSC produce im￾mune modulatory and regenerative factors in response
to inflammatory stimuli. One of the most studied me￾chanisms by which inflammation triggers MSC activity
is treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-γ). This cyto￾kine is typically produced during inflammatory Th1 im￾mune responses that are associated with autoimmunity
mediated by cellular means, such as CD8 T cells and NK
cells. Examples of conditions associated with this type of
immune response include multiple sclerosis, diabetes
type 1, and rheumatoid arthritis [72]. Exposure of MSC
to INF-γ has been demonstrated by numerous groups to
increase the immune suppressive activity by stimulation
of the enzyme IDO [73-76]. As expected, exposure to
this inflammatory mediator induced production of other
inhibitors of inflammation by MSCs, including the com￾plement inhibitor Factor H [77], as well as the immune
modulatory molecules TGF-β and HGF [78]. At a func￾tional level, Noone et al. demonstrated that INF-γ pre￾treatment of MSC resulted in protection of MSCs from
NK-mediated killing in part through upregulation of
prostaglandin E (PGE)-2 synthesis [79]. IFN-γ, but
also tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1α, and
IL-1β induce Gal-9 in MSC [80].
Another inflammatory mediator known to induce rege￾nerative activities in MSC is the macrophage-derived cyto￾kine TNF-α. TNF-α pretreatment of MSCs endowed the
cells with superior angiogenic activity in vitro, as assessed
by expression of VEGF, as well as in vivo in an animal
model of critical limb ischemia, as compared to untreated
MSCs [81]. Another study demonstrated that TNF-α pre￾conditioning increased proliferation, mobilization, and
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and up-regulated bone
morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) protein level. BMP-2
silencing by siRNA partially inhibited osteogenic differen￾tiation of MSC induced by TNF-α [82]. More recent stu￾dies have shown that activators of innate immunity, such
as lipopolysaccharide, and toll like receptor (TLR) ago￾nists, also are capable of stimulating regenerative activity
of MSCs through induction of production of paracrine fac￾tors such as VEGF [83]. IFN-γ and TLR also up-regulate
the glucocorticoids production which decreases T-cells
stimulated by radiotherapy in colonic mucosa [84]. In
general there is evidence to suggest that inflammatory
stimuli enhance the regenerative potential and anti￾inflammatory response of MSCs.
Tri-dimensional culture system activation
MSC are most typically grown in vitro in monolayer sys￾tems in surface treated plastic flasks. Tridimensional con￾figurations such as spheroid culture have been shown to
stimulate higher levels of trophic factor secretion com￾pared to monolayer culture. One of the first observations
were that lung MSC micro-emboli of myocardial infarcted
mice produced TNF-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG-6)
and found it to be an important anti-inflammatory factor
that improved outcomes [42]; TSG-6 is not found in sig￾nificant quantities in standard MSC monolayer culture.
Bartosh et al. [85] found that hanging drop induced MSC
spheres containing 25 K cell per drop produced sig￾nificantly higher TSG-6 than monolayer cultures with
production increasing over 4 days of culture. In addition,
they found higher expression of the anti-inflammatory
and antiapoptotic protein STC-1, CXCR4; and three

anticancer proteins: TRAIL, IL-24 and CD82 in the MSC
spheres.
Conditioned medium (CM) from human MSC spher￾oids inhibited production of TNF-α, CXCL2, IL6,
IL12p40, and IL23 from LPS stimulated macrophages, and
presented higher production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
This anti-inflammatory and immune modulator is pro￾duced through a caspase-dependent IL-1 pathway [86,87].
Of relevancy is that therapeutically, spheroids and
spheroid-derived cells were more effective anti￾inflammatory agents in a murine model of zymosan￾induced peritonitis than monolayer MSC culture cells
[85]. Further studies by the same group demonstrated that
in vivo, intraperitoneal MSCs tended to self-aggregate
resulting in self-activation of increased production of
trophic factors [87].
Dynamic cultures using spinner flask or rotating wall
vessel bioreactor have shown to form small spheroids
and demonstrated better osteogenesis and adipogenesis
differentiation characteristics, as well as higher concen￾tration of IL-24 [88].
Overall, these data suggest that the paracrine effects of
MSCs are inducible, and have a relationship with
context-, or niche-specific settings (Figure 1).
MSC produced biomolecules
As described above, MSCs produce a plethora of bio￾logically active molecules in response to various stimuli.
In this section we will list some of the common mole￾cules associated with MSC activity, and describe their
biological significance.
Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF-1)
Originally discovered as a gene transcript associated with
liver regeneration [89], HGF-1 is the high affinity ligand
for the receptor tyrosine kinase Met, whose activation is
associated with a variety of regenerative activities inclu￾ding angiogenesis, myogenesis, and hematopoiesis [90].
HGF-1 is secreted as a single inactive polypeptide and is
cleaved by serine proteases into a 69-kDa alpha-chain and
34-kDa beta-chain. A disulfide bond between the alpha
and beta chains produces the active, heterodimeric mo￾lecule. The protein belongs to the plasminogen subfamily
of S1 peptidases but has no detectable protease activity.
Demonstration of regenerative activity by HGF-1 outside
of the liver has been shown by experiments demonstrating
involvement of this cytokine in acceleration of wound
healing, including in cutaneous [91], corneal [92] and
gastric [93] wounds. Other biological activities of HGF-1
include stimulation of angiogenesis, which was demon￾strated by studies in which injection of HGF-1 plasmid re￾sulted in limb salvage in animals [94], and humans
[95,96], in limbs with poor circulation. In line with other
soluble factors associated with regenerative processes,
HGF-1 possesses immune modulatory activity. Treatment
of dendritic cells with HGF-1 results in reduction of ability
to induce generation of inflammatory Th1 cells, in part
through blocking expression of co-stimulatory molecules
such as CD80 and CD86 [97]. Furthermore, studies have
shown that in vivo administration of HGF-1 protects
against autoimmune disease such as experimental auto￾immune encephalomyelitis, and collagen induced arthritis,
through stimulation of T-regs producing the immune sup￾pressive cytokine IL-10 [98,99].
MSC production of HGF-1 has been shown to be cri￾tical in several in vivo therapeutic activities of MSCs.
One example is in immune modulation associated with
intravenous administration of MSCs in models of auto￾immunity. Bai et al. demonstrated that administration of
either MSCs or MSC conditioned medium were capable
of suppressing progression, and inducing remission of
disease pathology in the EAE model of multiple scle￾rosis. Serial sections of tissue from treated mice revealed
high concentrations of HGF-1, which was also found in
the conditioned media. Blocking antibodies to HGF-1
were demonstrated to negate the protective effects of
MSCs or MSC conditioned media in this model [100].
Neuroprotective effects of MSC conditioned media also
appeared to be dependent on HGF-1, based on experi￾ments in which neutralization of HGF-1 resulted in loss
of protection from apoptosis in a glutamate induced
excitotoxicity model [101]. Suppression of apoptosis by
HGF-1 was also demonstrated to be essential for the
therapeutic effects of adipose derived MSCs in a rodent
model of acute kidney failure induced by high dose cis￾platin. Yasuda et al. [102], demonstrated that while local
administration of adipose MSCs was capable of reducing
acute tubular necrosis and loss of kidney function after
cisplatin administration, these effects were negated by
administration of anti-HGF-1 antibodies.
Thus the effects of HGF-1 generated by MSCs appear
to be multifunctional, directed towards the combination
of: angiogenesis; immune modulation; and protection
from apoptosis.
Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β)
TGF-β is a protein generally known to possess autocrine
inhibitory activities to non-malignant cells, and is widely
expressed in a variety of tissues in a latent form [103].
TGF-β signals through the SMAD family of intracellular
proteins and its overexpression is associated with fibrotic
disease [104]. Local production of TGF-β is a potent
mechanism of immune suppression in a variety of con￾texts including tumor [105,106], pregnancy [107], ocular
[108], and testicular immune privilege [109]. Mechanis￾tically, TGF-β acts by suppressing dendritic cell matu￾ration [110], stimulating T-regs production [111], and
suppressing generation of inflammatory Th17 cells [112].

MSC production of TGF-β has been demonstrated in
MSCs derived from numerous tissues including adipose
[113], bone marrow [114], and umbilical cord [115]. The
essential contribution of TGF-β to suppression of T cell
proliferation by MSC was originally demonstrated by
Zhao et al. [116]. They showed that antibody neutra￾lization resulted in restoration of lymphocyte prolifera￾tion. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that MSC
Figure 1 Effects of the hypoxia, inflammation, and 3D culture on MSC in terms of expression and secretion of molecules of interest for
cell therapy. a) Hypoxia activates the HIF and the NF-kappa β; increases the expression of several growth factors (inside the square), it also induces
IDO activity and enhances stemness (Oct-4 and Rex-1). Also, the hypoxia pre-conditioned MSC, favor the activation of caspase 3, Bcl-2, MTP-2, TGF- β1
on target cells improving apoptosis resistance; improve regenerative capacity of muscle and endothelial cells. b) Inflammation induced by INF-γ
increases the expression of anti-inflammatory and regenerative molecules (in the square) and, through TNF-α enhances the production of VEGF and
BMP-2 which favor formation of new vessels and osteoblasts respectively. Also MSC exposed to LPS are able to encapsulate mitochondria and deliver
them to other cells. c) 3D culture methods such as microcarriers or spheroids induce the production of TSG-6 and increases PGE2 secretion. Besides,
it also favor the secretion of antiapoptotic and anticancer molecules (in the square). Further, MSCs obtained from 3D configurations, inhibit the
expression of inflammatory and cancer related molecules in target cells.

administration to animals suffering ischemic injury to
the CNS resulted in improved neurological outcomes,
which was abrogated by silencing TGF-β in the adminis￾tered MSC [117]. The TGF-β dependent therapeutic ef￾fects were associated with reduction of inflammatory
cytokine expression in the CNS and suppression of
microglial activation.
MSC-based immune modulation has been shown by
several investigators to be mediated in part by TGF-β.
Ye et al. utilized an in vitro model of T-regs generation
to demonstrate that MSC-derived TGF-b is necessary
for differentiation of FoxP3 expressing T-regs from naïve
T cells in an antigen-nonspecific system [118]. In an
in vivo study, administration of MSC into a bacterially￾induced hepatic injury model was shown to result in al￾leviation of hepatotoxicity, mediated in part by TGF-β
dependent generation of T-regs [118].
Overall, the effects of TGF-β production by MSC ap￾pear to relate primarily to immune modulation. Given
the profibrotic role of TGF-β in various pathological
conditions, the balancing act that this cytokine plays in
the mediation of MSC derived therapeutic activities is
subject of intense investigation.
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
VEGF was one of the first described soluble angiogenesis
stimulation factors [119]. This naturally occurring glyco￾protein, which acts as a growth factor for endothelial
cells, is produced by a variety of tissues in response to
reduced oxygen tension, whose transcription is mediated
in part by activation of the HIF-1 [120]. The essential
role of VEGF in angiogenesis is exemplified by numer￾ous studies demonstrating that blockade of this protein
is therapeutic in angiogenesis-mediated diseases such as
neoplasia and wet macular degeneration [121,122].
Conversely, administration of VEGF protein or DNA
plasmid induces angiogenesis in animal models and in
clinical trials [123,124]. Unfortunately, clinical use of
VEGF for treatment of ischemic conditions has not met
the required endpoints in Phase III clinical trials, in part
due to poor regulation of VEGF-induced angiogenesis.
In contrast, MSC expression of VEGF appears to be
tightly regulated based on physiological need, and may
represent a superior means of inducing therapeutic
angiogenesis [125].
The role of VEGF in MSC-mediated angiogenesis was
initially described in studies of bone marrow MSC admi￾nistration into ischemic myocardium in animal models of
heart failure. Stimulation of angiogenesis and endothelial
cell proliferation was associated with MSC expression of
VEGF in both small and large animal studies [126,127].
The superior effect of MSC administration in heart failure
models, compared to administration of VEGF alone was
demonstrated in subsequent studies [128]. Suggesting
causative effects of VEGF in angiogenesis are studies
showing that blockade of VEGF blocks MSC-induced
angiogenesis in several animal models [129,130]. Fur￾thermore, VEGF works as anti-apoptotic molecule sup￾pressing p53-mediated apoptosis by activation of FAK
(focal adhesion kinase), and also by promoting Bcl-2
and A1 [131,132]; clinical response to cell-based inter￾vention has been associated with increases in serum
VEGF levels [133].
Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6)
TSG-6 is a 35 kDa glycoprotein which was originally dis￾covered in the synovial fluids of patients with arthritis
and serum of patients with inflammatory diseases [134].
Physiologically, it appears that one of the functions of
TSG-6 is to counteract inflammatory effects of TNF-a
and IL-1 [135]. Relating to MSC, original studies by
Prockop et al. examined soluble mediators that may be
responsible for regenerative effects of intravenously ad￾ministered MSC in an animal infarct model. Cell trac￾king studies revealed that the majority of administered
MSC lodged into the lung, however, potent post-infarct
regeneration was observed. Using microarray analysis, it
was found that TSG-6 was one of the most highly up￾regulated transcripts in lung-lodged MSC. Interestingly,
silencing of TSG-6 in the administered MSC resulted in
loss of therapeutic activity, whereas, administration of
exogenous TSG-6 resulted in replication of therapeutic
activity [42]. MSC therapeutic activities in other animal
models of disease was observed to be dependent on
TSG-6, including cerebral ischemia [136], diabetes type
1 [137], peritoneal adhesions [138,139], and experimen￾tal autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [140].
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
PGE2 is a 352 Da molecule belongs to the prostanoid
family of small molecules, and is a product of arachi￾donic acid metabolism by the cyclo-oxygenase family of
enzymes. Immune suppressive activities of PGE2 have
been well characterized by type 2 macrophages and im￾mature dendritic cells as a means of feedback inhibition
after immune activation [141]. Inhibition of T cell activa￾tion by myeloid suppressor cells is also induced by PGE2
in models of cancer and pregnancy [142-145]. Mechanis￾tically, PGE-2 inhibits various immune cells including
NK cells [146], granulocytes [147], dendritic cells [148],
and Th1 cells [149]. Additionally, PGE2 has also been
shown to directly induce differentiation of T-regs ex￾pressing FoxP3 from naive T cells [150].
One of the most potent demonstrations of the ability
of MSC-derived PGE2 to alter disease pathology was a
study by Nemeth et al., in which BM-MSC inhibited
sepsis in the aggressive cecal-puncture ligation model.
Protection from sepsis was associated with generation of

IL-10 producing macrophages, whose differentiation was
dependent on MSC-produced PGE-2 [151]. Subsequent
studies have supported the pivotal role of MSC gener￾ated PGE-2 in mediation of anti-inflammatory activities.
Zhang et al. demonstrated that MSC administration into
a bacterial-induced model of liver failure resulted in pro￾tection from lethality. Protection was associated with
generation of T-regs and increases in serum IL-10. The
systemic administration of COX inhibitors abrogated the
protective effect [152]. In models of T cell mediated im￾mune pathology, MSC administration inhibited alloge￾neic cardiac allograft rejection. When blockade of PGE2
generation was accomplished by COX inhibition, graft
rejection, mediated by Th1 cells was observed [153].
PGE2 thus appears to be one of the major mediators
of MSC associated immune modulation, specifically by
acting as a promoter of T-regs and inhibitor of inflam￾matory responses. This is somewhat paradoxical to ob￾servations that systemic administration of PGE2 at large
concentrations is pro-inflammatory. These differences
are explained in part by various affinity PGE2 receptors
on target tissues, and illustrate the biological complexity
of MSC activities.
PGE2 is produced in different concentrations by MSCs
depending on the source. Amniotic membrane [154] and
chorionic villi [12] MSC produced higher concentrations
of PGE2 under in vitro culture conditions than bone
marrow or cord derived MSC. This variable should be
considered if beneficial effect of PGE2 is desired for cli￾nical applications.
Galectin 1 and 9
Galectins are a family of proteins that share characteristic
amino acid sequences and affinity for β-galactoside sugars,
such as N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-3GlcNAc or Galβ1-
4GlcNAc), and have consecutive numbers [155]. Gieseke
group [156] have shown that Galectin 1 plays an important
role in the immonumodulatory capacity of MSC. They
demonstrated that T cells regulation capacity was dimin￾ished significantly in galectin-1 knockdown cells compared
to wild type because of partially restored proliferation of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and that the release of TNFα, IFNγ,
IL-2 and IL-10 was modulated by galectin 1.
MSC immunomodulation is also affected by galectin-9,
which is highly induced by inflammatory stimuli intracel￾lular and also in the conditioned medium. Galectin-9
knockdown cells lose an important portion of their T-Cell
antiproliferative effect [80].
MSC derived microvesicles
Production of microvesicles by MSC has been reported
to be associated with regenerative activities. Microve￾sicles are generated from budding of the cell membrane
and are considered to be 50 nm – 1000 μm in size. One
of the first descriptions of microvesicles as related to
regenerative medicine was by Quesenberry’s group who
demonstrated that culture of injured adult tissue with
bone marrow cells results in bone marrow differentiation
into cells of similar lineage as the injured tissue, with the
proclivity of differentiation being mediated by microvesi￾cles released from the injured tissue [157]. Subsequent
studies have shown that there is a bidirectional communi￾cation between injured tissue and cells with regenerative
potential, in that various stem cells also release microve￾sicles [158]. Specific examples of the regenerative potential
of microvesicles follow. Bruno et al. utilized a glycerol￾induced SCID mouse model of acute kidney injury, in
which human MSC derived microvesicles were adminis￾tered intravenously. Protection from acute kidney injury
was observed, which was correlated with transfer of hu￾man miRNA into tubular epithelial cells. Treatment of
microvesicles with RNAse resulted in abrogation of pro￾tective effects. This study supported the concept that
MSC exert a protective effect against cellular apoptosis
through transfer of miRNA [159]. In another model of
kidney injury, Gatti et al. administered human MSC de￾rived microvesicles into a renal ischemia reperfusion
model [160]. A dose-dependent inhibition of acute tubular
necrosis was observed, which correlated with preservation
of renal function. Similar to the previously described
study, protection from kidney injury was dependent on
functional miRNA since treatment with RNAse eliminated
protective activity.
Previous studies have suggested that MSC conditioned
media is capable of stimulation proliferation of endothe￾lial cells in vitro, and angiogenesis in vivo. Although the
involvement of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and
HGF-1 was previously believed to be responsible for this
effect, antibody-blocking was not able to achieve 100%
inhibition of angiogenesis. Zhang et al. studied microve￾sicles collected from hypoxia preconditioned MSC CM,
and demonstrated that microvesicles can be internalized
by umbilical cord endothelial cells and promote prolife￾ration in a dose-dependent manner. Also, MSC microve￾sicles stimulate angiogenesis in a hind limb ischemia
model [161].
Another therapeutic activity of microvesicles appears
to be related to suppression of alveolar inflammation in
models of acute lung injury. Previous studies have de￾monstrated that intravenous MSC administration pro￾tects animals from endotoxin induced lung injury). Zhu
et al. showed a dose-dependent reduction in water
leakage and neutrophilic infiltration into the lung when
intrapulmonary administration of bone marrow derived
MSC isolated microvesicles were used in a similar model
[162]. Interestingly, neutralization of therapeutic activity
was observed by blockade of keratinocyte growth factor
using siRNA.
Madrigal et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:260 Page 8 of 14
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/1/260

Another important study by Islam et al. shows the
capacity of MSC to deliver encapsulated mitochondria in
lung epithelial cells treated with LPS, leading to the sur￾vival of the host cells [163].
Overall, these studies suggest that microvesicles play an
important role in MSC associated paracrine therapeutic
activities, which may complement activities associated
with release of soluble proteins and small molecules by
MSC.
MSC derived exosomes
Exosomes are nanoparticles (40-100 nm) in size that pos￾sess highly defined homogeneous characteristics [164].
Originally, thought to be a by-product of cell protein turn￾over [165], these nanoparticles are becoming appreciated
as a critical means of intracellular communication in areas
ranging from neurotransmission [166], to immune modu￾lation [165], to infectious disease [167].
Compared with other secreted vesicles such as micro￾vesicles (described above), exosomes have much better
defined biophysical and biochemical properties, specifi￾cally, they have a diameter of 40–100 nm (with a density
in sucrose of 1.13–1.19 g/ml, and can be sedimented at
100,000 g [164]. Their membranes are enriched in cho￾lesterol, sphingomyelin and ceramide, and are known to
contain lipid rafts. Exosomes were originally discovered
as a means of exportation of the transferrin receptor
during sheep reticulocyte maturation [168]. In recent
years an explosion of interest in exosomes has occurred,
with a wide variety of cells being reported to secrete
these nanoparticles ranging from T cells [169,170], B
cells [171,172], dendritic cells [173,174], tumor cells
[175,176], neurons [177,178], oligodendrocytes [179],
and placental cells [180]. Additionally, there is evidence
that immune escape of the “fetal allograft” is associated
with exosomes [181].
While MSC have been previously demonstrated to exert
therapeutic effects in animal models of cardiac infarction,
Lai et al. asked whether MSC-derived exosomes exert
similar effects. They reported that MSC cultures generate
phospholipid containing vesicles consisting of cholesterol,
sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine. These vesicles
were believed to be exosomes based on coimmunoprecipi￾tating with exosome-associated proteins, such as CD81,
CD9, and Alix. These particles were purified as a homoge￾neous population of particles with a hydrodynamic radius
of 55–65 nm by size-exclusion fractionation on a HPLC.
It was found that administration of these particles, which
resembled exosomes biochemically, to animal cardiac
infarct models resulted in reduction of infarct size and im￾proved heart function [162]. Mechanistically, the effects of
MSC-derived exosomes on cardiac infarct appear to be
mediated by increasing levels of ATP and NADH in car￾diomyocytes, as well as decreasing oxidative stress and
increased phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-GSK￾3β [182].
In addition to protection from ischemia reperfusion in￾jury, MSC functions such as inhibition of fibrotic injury
have also been shown to be mediated by MSC-derived
exosomes. Li et al. utilized the carbon tetrachloride model
of fibrotic liver injury to demonstrate that administration
of MSC-derived exosomes inhibited collagen deposition
and preserved liver function in a manner similar to ad￾ministration of MSCs themselves [183].
Mechanistically, the regenerative activities of MSC￾derived exosomes are a subject of ongoing investigation.
Some studies suggest miRNA transfer by MSC-derived
exosomes mediates various therapeutic effects [184], in a
manner similar to microvesicles. Other studies suggest
the involvement of exosome associated proteins such as
lactadherin, or galectins, which are known to possess
anti-inflammatory functions [185].
Conclusions
MSCs are rapidly emerging as a clinically-viable cell ther￾apy, with numerous trials ongoing, and registration for
marketing approval in several jurisdictions. The paradigm
shift that MSCs activities are mediated by secreted factors
as opposed to the previous notion of differentiation into
injured tissue offers numerous possibilities for therapeutic
development based on MSC secreted products. Current
investigations at replicating in vitro the optimal environ￾ment for MSC production of therapeutic factors will lead
to development of therapies utilizing MSC secreted
factors which will alleviate the need for administration
of cells.
