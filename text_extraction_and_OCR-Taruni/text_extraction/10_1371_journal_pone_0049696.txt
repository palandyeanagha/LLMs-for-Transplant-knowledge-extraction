Abstract
Objective: To compare two bariatric surgical principles with regard to effects on blood pressure and salt intake.
Background: In most patients bariatric surgery induces a sustained weight loss and a reduced cardiovascular risk profile but
the long-term effect on blood pressure is uncertain.
Methods: Cohort study with data from the prospective, controlled Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study involving 480
primary health care centres and 25 surgical departments in Sweden. Obese patients treated with non-surgical methods
(Controls, n = 1636 and n = 1132 at 2 y and 10 y follow up, respectively) were compared to patients treated with gastric
bypass (GBP, n = 245 and n = 277, respectively) or purely restrictive procedures (vertical banded gastroplasty or gastric
banding; VBG/B, n = 1534 and n = 1064, respectively).
Results: At long-term follow-up (median 10 y) GBP was associated with lowered systolic (mean: 25.1 mm Hg) and diastolic
pressure (25.6 mmHg) differing significantly from both VBG/B (21.5 and 22.1 mmHg, respectively; p,0.001) and Controls
(+1.2 and 23.8 mmHg, respectively; p,0.01). Diurnal urinary output was +100 ml (P,0.05) and +170 ml (P,0.001) higher in
GBP subjects than in weight-loss matched VBG/B subjects at the 2 y and 10 y follow-ups, respectively. Urinary output was
linearly associated with blood pressure only after GBP and these patients consumed approximately 1 g salt per day more at
the follow-ups than did VBG/B (P,0.01).
Conclusions: The purely restrictive techniques VBG/B exerted a transient blood pressure lowering effect, whereas gastric
bypass was associated with a sustained blood pressure reduction and an increased diuresis. The daily salt consumption was
higher after gastric bypass than after restrictive bariatric surgery.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity is dramatically increasing and
associated morbidities such as myocardial infarction, stroke,
cancer and diabetes are serious additional demands on health
care providers [1,2]. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment that
has proved to maintain a reduced body weight over time [3]. Even
more important, this type of gastrointestinal surgical interference
improves most of the obesity-associated cardiovascular risk factors
[4–6]. Interestingly, several of these improvements are not
dependent on the body weight reduction indicating that the
gastrointestinal tract directly influences the metabolic control.
Hypertension is a risk factor in the metabolic syndrome that is
strongly associated with heart disease and stroke [7]. Controlled
studies with short (2 y to 4 y) follow-up periods indicate that
bariatric surgery exerts a blood pressure lowering effect [4,8,9].
However, controlled studies on the efficacy over longer periods are
lacking or inconclusive [6]. The large scale, prospective, controlled
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49696

Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study demonstrated that recovery
from hypertension had improved 10y after bariatric surgery,
whereas incidence had not.|4] Two factors made us reconsider the
long-term results regarding blood pressure in the SOS study: 1./
the study is still ongoing, and the number of 10 y follow-ups have
increased since the previous report; and 2./the treatment arm in
the SOS study consists of two principles for gastrointestinal
interference – gastric bypass (GBP) and restrictive gastric band
procedures – that could theoretically have different effects on
blood pressure.
Restrictive bariatric surgery refers to a narrowing of the
stomach lumen by certain banding procedures and is represented
in the present study by vertical banded gastroplasty or gastric
banding (VBG/B). These procedures provide a resistance
(‘restriction’) to food passage into the distal part of the stomach
and excessive meal results in food retention in the gastric
compartment oral to the band. Distension-sensitive afferent nerves
in the wall of the proximal stomach, and presumably also in the
esophagus, will then mediate sensations of discomfort and even
pain that consequently motivates the individual to terminate food
ingestion. However, also more subtle mechanisms may be
involved. Early satiation and inter-meal satiety have recently been
shown to be induced with well calibrated adjustable gastric bands
giving only a briefly delayed bolus transit into the infraband
stomach, thus without food retention. The satiety signalling in this
case is ascribed to esophageal reinforced propulsive motility and
compression of gastric vagal afferents at the level of the gastric
band [10]. The other principle, GBP, has more complex and
partly unknown mechanisms of action. Gastric flow resistance is
probably less important and instead the unloading of the
gastroduodenum of nutrients and/or the direct loading of the
jejunum influence appetite and improve metabolic control [11].
One aim of the present study was to investigate the effect on blood
pressure of these two surgical principles. Furthermore, dietary salt
(NaCl) is of great importance for body fluid homeostasis and blood
pressure regulation [12–14]. Consequently, because both surgical
and non-surgical obesity treatment regimens markedly influence
food intake, it can be expected that salt ingestion is altered, which
could give secondary effects on blood pressure. A second aim was

thus to investigate whether, after either of the two surgical
principles, changes in salt intake is important for blood pressure.
Methods
Study outline and ethics statement
The present investigation is based on the SOS study, which
compares obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 2010)
with contemporaneously matched, non-operated obese control
patients (n = 2037). The inclusion of study patients began 1987
and was continued until 2001. The design and selection of the
study participants have been described in detail elsewhere [4,15].
The SOS study is conducted according to the principles for
experiments with human beings as defined in the Declaration of
Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of University of Gothenburg (decision no S 604-
01). This principal decision was also exposed to, and approved by
seven other Swedish regional ethics review boards, each harbour￾ing one or several of the involved study sites. All participants had
given informed consent. Due to national recommendations when
the SOS-study was launched in 1987 only verbal informed consent
was initially used but later, when Sweden had adapted to the
international harmonisation of ethical guidelines, written informed
consents were instead used. In order to focus on effects of the two
principle bariatric surgical techniques, the intention-to-treat
analysis was abandoned. The present investigation was instead
designed as a cohort analysis with one short-term (median 2 y,
Table 1) and one long-term (median 10 y) follow-up period
(Table 2).
Study groups
The SOS study subjects were sorted into the following three
study cohorts (for details see Supporting information Figure S1):
Gastric bypass (GBP) patients, including the patients originally
operated with GBP, but also patients converted from VBG/B to
GBP, as well as subjects that were originally allocated to the
control arm of the SOS study but had been treated with GBP
during the study period, if the GBP operation had been performed
at least 5 y prior to the 10 y follow-up visit; Vertical banded
gastroplasty or gastric banding (VBG/B) patients, excluding those
who had been converted to GBP but including control subjects in
the SOS study that had been treated with VBG/B if performed at
least 5 y prior to the 10 y follow-up; Non-operated control
patients, including all subjects that were originally allocated to the
control arm of the SOS study and had remained on conventional
treatment. Subjects with bariatric constructions other than GBP
and VBG/B were excluded from the analysis. With regard to
blood pressure measurements, the follow-up rate was 92% in the
GBP group and 92% in the VBG/B group at 2 y, and 68% vs.
74%, respectively, at the 10 y follow-up. The follow-up rate in the
control group was 81% and 62% at 2 y and 10 y, respectively.
Baseline characteristics for each study cohort are given in Table 1
and 2.
Examination procedures
Systolic blood pressure and Korotkoff phase 5 diastolic blood
pressure (after 15 min in the supine position), body weight and
height were measured at each study visit. Use of blood pressure
lowering medications (antihypertensives) was assessed with a
questionnaire. A user of antihypertensives was defined as someone
who, on a daily basis, took one or more medications included
under the following codes: C02 (antihypertensives), C03 (diuretics),
C07 (beta blocking agents), C08 (calcium channel blockers) or C09
(agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system) in the Anatomic
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. A user of
diuretics was defined as someone who, on a daily basis, took a
medication included under the ATC code: CO3 (diuretics). The
subjects were instructed to collect urine over 24 h prior to the
baseline examination, the 2 y follow-up visit and the 10 y follow￾up visit, and to bring it to the examination site the next day. With
regard to urine collections, the follow-up rate was 90% in the GBP
group and 91% in the VBG/B group at 2 y, and 66% vs. 72%,
respectively, at the 10 y follow-up. The follow-up rate in the
control group was 81% and 61% at 2 y and 10 y, respectively.
The volume of the urine was noted and a 200-mL sample was
transferred to the Central Laboratory of Sahlgrenska University
Hospital (accredited according to European Norm EN45001).
Urinary and serum Na+ and K+ were measured by an ion-selective
electrode (Modular P, Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia AB,
Bromma, Sweden). Urinary and serum creatinine was measured
by enzymatic photometry (Modular P, Roche Diagnostics
Scandinavia AB). Twenty-four hour urinary excretions of sodium
(U-Na+
), potassium and creatinine were calculated from these data
and the recorded 24 h urine output (U-Volume). The schedule,
questionnaire, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements,
and laboratory examinations were identical for GBP, VBG/B and
control subjects.
Statistical analysis
The Students t test compared continuous variables at baseline,
and the chi-square test was used for all comparisons of
proportions. All changes over time were calculated as the
difference between individual values at baseline and values at
the 2 y and 10 y follow-up visits. Adjustments for baseline
differences between the cohorts (Table 1 & 2) were made using
multiple linear regression, taking into account sex, age and
baseline BMI. Only adjusted blood pressure changes are reported.
In some analyses (as indicated in text and legends), BMI change
was added as a covariate to the multiple regression model in order
to compare subjects with equal BMI changes after GBP and
VBG/B surgery. Changes in 24 h urinary excretion of creatinine
were included as a covariate in order to adjust for potential
between-group differences in the completeness of 24 h urine
collections. All P-values are two tailed. Means and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) are given in the text and figures, unless otherwise
stated. Statistical significance was set at P,0.05. The statistical
analyses were carried out using SPSS, version 18 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois).
Results
Arterial pressure was markedly reduced over the long
term by gastric bypass
Weight reduction following GBP was greater than after VBG/
B, while non-surgical treatment was not associated with any
significant effect (Figure 1, upper panel). The systolic pressure in
the GBP cohort had decreased by 212.1 (214.0 to 210.1) and
25.1 (27.1 to 23.1) mm Hg, and the diastolic pressure by 27.3
(28.5 to 26.2) and 25.6 (26.7 to 24.4) mm Hg, compared to
baseline, at the 2 y and 10 y follow-ups, respectively (Figure 1,
middle and lower panels). The VBG/B cohort also demonstrated
reduced arterial pressure at the 2 y follow-up, but this decrease
was significantly smaller than that in the GBP-treated patients.
Systolic blood pressure in the VBG/B cohort at the 10 y follow-up
had decreased slightly compared to controls, whereas diastolic
pressure had actually decreased more in the non-operated
controls. The weight reduction was linearly associated with
changes in blood pressure after VBG/B and in the controls.

Interestingly, such an association was less evident after 2 y, and
absent at the 10 y follow up visit in the GBP cohort (Supporting
information Figure S2).
After 2 y, the proportions of patients taking antihypertensives
did not differ between the GBP (27%) and VBG/B (31%) cohorts.
However, both these proportions were significantly lower
(P,0.001) than in the control cohort (43%). At the 10 y visit,
the proportion of patients using antihypertensives was significantly
lower in the GBP group (35%) as compared to both the VBG/B
(45%, P,0.01) and the controls (53%, P,0.001).
Gastric bypass exerted a weight-independent diuretic
effect
Diurnal urinary outputs (U-Volume) in absolute values were
reduced in both the GBP and the VBG/B cohorts (Figure 2, upper
panel). When related to body weight, GBP patients exhibited
higher urinary volumes at both the 2 y and 10 y follow-up visits
(Figure 2, lower panel). A similar effect, although of less than half
the magnitude in the GBP group, was present in the VBG/B
cohort after 2 y, but not at the 10 y follow-up.
The diuretic effect of GBP was further quantified by direct
comparison of the two bariatric techniques after adjustment for
BMI reduction. The 24 h urinary output was +0.10 and +0.17 L
larger after GBP as compared to VBG/B at the 2 y and 10 y
follow-ups, respectively (Table 3 and 4). The proportion of patients
using diuretics at the 2 y and 10 y follow-ups did not differ
between the GBP (10% and 17%, respectively) and the VBG/B
cohorts (13% and 19%, respectively). Also after exclusion of
patients using diuretics the 24 h urinary output was +0.10 (95% CI
0.01–0.20) and +0.17 (0.08 to 0.26) L larger after GBP as
compared to VBG/B at the 2 y and 10 y follow-ups, respectively.
Urinary output was associated with BP changes only after
gastric bypass
Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were
negatively associated with the change in diurnal urinary output
(P,0.01 at the 2 y follow-up and P,0.05 at the 10 y follow-up,
respectively) after gastric bypass (Supporting information Figure
S3). No associations between blood pressure and delta urinary
volume were observed in the VBG/B or control groups.

Salt excretion was higher after gastric bypass than after
restrictive surgery
Diurnal urinary excretion of sodium (U-Na+
) at the 2 y and 10 y
follow-ups had decreased in the GBP and VBG/B cohorts and had
increased slightly in the controls (Figure 3, upper panel). When
related to body weight, U-Na+ had increased in the GBP group
but was unchanged in the VBG/B group and in the non-operated
controls at 2 y (Figure 3, lower panel). At the 10 y follow-up, U￾Na+ in relation to body weight remained increased in the GBP
cohort but had decreased in the VBG/B group and was
unchanged in obese controls.

A BMI reduction-adjusted quantitative analysis showed that the
24 h urinary excretion of sodium was +19 and +20 mmol higher
in the GBP group than in the VBG/B group at the 2 y and 10 y
follow-ups, respectively (Table 2). Because urinary Na+ output
over 24 h equals Na+ intake, daily salt (NaCl) intake could be
calculated: GBP subjects were calculated to consume 1.1 g (0.4 to
1.9) and 1.2 g (0.6 to 1.8) more salt on a daily basis than did the
VBG/B subjects with equal BMI changes 2 y and 10 y after
surgery, respectively.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were positively associated
with salt intake in the VBG/B and control groups at 2 y and 10 y,
respectively (data not shown). However, no associations between
blood pressure changes and salt excretion were observed after
GBP.
Discussion
Bariatric surgery was originally developed for weight reducing
purposes. Today we know that these gastrointestinal interferences
also markedly reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease as shown
by an estimated 40% reduction in 10 y Framingham risk score [5].
Furthermore, Heneghan et al showed that bariatric surgery is
associated with a 68% resolution/reduction of obesity associated
hypertension [5]. However, the mean follow up time of this
analysis was only 34 months and studies over longer periods (ie. 8
to 10 y) are few and usually uncontrolled [5,6]. The present
investigation, being an ad hoc-analysis based on the controlled
prospective SOS study [4,15], provides the first longterm direct
comparison between conventionally treated (ie. dietary advice, life
style changes, pharmacology etc) obese patients and those treated
surgically with either GBP or VBG/B. Previously published meta￾analyses have shown that a pharmacological reduction of diastolic
pressure by 5 mm Hg considerably reduces the risks of stroke and
ischemic heart disease [7]. Interestingly, a blood pressure
reduction of this order of magnitude was in the present study
recorded only in the GBP cohort at the 10 y follow-up and despite
a relatively low usage of antihypertensives. It is well known that
weight reduction per se is associated with a decrease in blood
pressure mainly due to the improvement of renal sodium retention
that is commonly associated to obesity [16,17]. Increased exercise
and a diet with low sodium and calorie contents can reduce blood
pressure in a weight dependent fashion [13,18]. However, the
long-term compliance with these types of life style changes is low
and there is eventually a relapse to overweight and increased blood
pressure. Bariatric surgery is currently the only evidence-based
treatment for maintaining a reduction in body weight [3].

Bariatric Surgery, Blood Pressure and Diuresis
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49696

Indeed, at the 2 y follow-up in the present study, the two
bariatric surgery cohorts exhibited reduced BMI and a reduced
arterial blood pressure compared to the non-operated controls.
However, at the 10 y follow-up in VBG/B patients, blood pressure
had returned near to preoperative levels despite a reduction in
body weight. One explanation may be that an increased
inclination for social interaction following weight reduction creates
iterated situations with a psychosocial stimulation of the sympa￾thetic nervous system, in turn increasing blood pressure [17].
Another possibility is that restrictive bariatric surgery induces a
dietary pattern promoting hypertension [19].
In contrast to restrictive bariatric surgery, GBP was followed by
a marked decrease in blood pressure also at the 10 y follow-up.
This finding suggests that GBP interferes with blood pressure
control via at least 2 principles: an initial transient blood pressure
reduction related to weight loss per se (similar as after VBG/B), and
a more long term mechanism unrelated to weight loss. This
interpretation is supported by the present observation that arterial
blood pressure was markedly more depressed after GBP than after
VBG/B, already after a period of only 2 y. Actually, a weight￾independent blood pressure reducing effect of GBP has previously
been reported as early as week one postoperatively, thus before
any significant weight loss [20]. Based on these observations it is
plausible to assume that the exclusion of the gastroduodenum, or
the direct loading of undigested food into the jejunum, added or
removed a blood pressure regulating factor acting in parallel with
the depressor effect of weight loss (Supporting information Figure
S2).
In analysing diurnal urinary volumes, we found that the GBP
patients excreted more urine per day than weight-matched
patients treated with restrictive bariatric surgery. Furthermore,
regression analysis demonstrated that changes in urinary output
were linearly associated with blood pressure changes only in the
GBP cohort (Supporting information Figure S3), indicating that
blood pressure reduction following gastric bypass can be attributed
to a diuretic action. It can perhaps be questioned whether a
chronic enhancement of diuresis by only 100 to 200 mL per day
explains the lowered blood pressure in the GBP cohort.
Interestingly, the users of diuretics compared to non-users in the
non-operated cohort had a similar difference in urinary output as
the one observed between GBP and VBG/B (Supporting
information Table S1). These results indicate that the GBP￾associated diuretic action is of clinical relevance with regard to
blood pressure control.
The mechanisms behind the diuretic action following GBP are
obscure. Bueter et al. recently demonstrated that an oral salt load

in rats operated with GBP was followed by an increased urine
output and natriuresis as well as increased water intake. However,
these authors could not distinguish between if the increased
diuresis was a primary mechanism, or if it was secondary to blood
volume expansion following drinking [21]. In the present study,
24 h natriuresis was higher after GBP, whereas potassium
excretion was more or less constant, suggesting a primary
natriuretic effect. The finding that the serum sodium concentra￾tion was elevated in the GBP group speaks, however, against such
an action (Table 2) [22].
We found that the calculated salt intake was more than +1 g
higher per day after GBP compared to salt intake in the patients
treated with restrictive bariatric surgery. Intuitively, high salt
intake should increase blood pressure [12–14]. However, this was
not the case in the present study indicating that GBP patients
lower their blood pressure despite an increased consumption of
salty foods. It may be speculated that GBP increases both salt
appetite and natriuresis explaining the slightly increased serum
sodium concentrations observed in the present study. By use of
surveys, Tichansky et al. showed that GBP patients were more
likely to develop an increased taste/affinity for salty foods than
gastric banding patients who where more likely to develop an
increased taste/affinity for sweet foods [23]. Hence, our findings
support the existence of a sodium sensor in the human upper gut
[24–26], that normally inhibits salt appetite and influence
natriuresis, being ‘‘bypassed’’ following GBP. The involved
gastrointestinal signalling mechanisms remains to be clearified.
The present study has some obvious limitations: The cohort
analysis was performed ad hoc and interpretations must be made
with caution because the SOS study was originally designed to
compare bariatric surgery per se with conventionally treated obese
patients and the study power was determined using mortality as
the primary outcome variable [15]. Another potential source of
error in the present study is the 24 h sampling of urine. As the
urine was collected by the study participants themselves, sampling
errors related to over- or under-collections must be considered.
However, there is little reason to believe that any of the surgery
groups would be more likely to provide over- or under-collections.
In addition, the differences in diurnal urine output and sodium
excretion between GBP- and VBG/B subjects remained signifi￾cant after adjusting these analyses for 24 h urinary excretion of
creatinine (data not shown). Another potential limitation of the
study is that the cohort representing ‘restrictive’ bariatric surgery
consists of two types of surgical procedures: VBG (n = 1189 and
n = 843 at the 2 y and 10 y visit, respectively) and gastric banding
(n = 328 and n = 202). These two operations have some obvious
technical differences that might have influenced the primary
outcome variables (BMI, arterial pressure, use of antihyperten￾sives/diuretics, diurnal urinary volume, estimated salt intake).
However, when a subgroup comparison was performed only one
significant difference appeared: the diastolic pressure had
decreased more after gastric banding at the 2 y visit (Supporting
information Table S2). As this difference (<1,2 mmHg) is of
minor clinical relevance the merger of the two operations into a
single cohort seems to be justified.
In conclusion: Gastric bypass is associated with a longstanding
reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and an
increased diuresis not related to weight loss. Despite a greater
blood pressure reduction, the daily salt consumption is higher after
GBP than after restrictive bariatric surgery.
