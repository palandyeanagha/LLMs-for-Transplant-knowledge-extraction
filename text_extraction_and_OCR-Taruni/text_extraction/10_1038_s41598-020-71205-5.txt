Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among maintenance hemodialysis patients is implicated in increased 
morbidity and mortality compared to uninfected patients. Sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens may not 
be optimal among patients requiring hemodialysis. Several studies, however, provide evidence that 
use of SOF among HCV-positive patients with renal impairment, is effective and safe. We searched 
Pubmed and Embase to identify studies reporting the efficacy and safety of SOF-based regimens for 
the treatment of HCV-positive patients on maintenance hemodialysis and performed a random effects 
meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate of the efficacy of SOF-based therapy was 95% (95% CI 
91–98%). The efficacy of the SOF-based regimen was 92% (95% CI 80–99%), 98% (95% CI 96–100%), 
and 100% (95% CI 95–100%) for the following doses: 400 mg on alternate days, 400 mg daily, and 
200 mg daily, respectively. The most frequent adverse event was fatigue with a pooled prevalence of 
16% (95% CI 5–29%), followed by anemia 15% (95% CI 3–31%), and nausea or vomiting 14% (95% CI 
4–27%). Anemia was more prevalent in treatment regimens containing ribavirin (46%, 95% CI 33–59%) 
compared to ribavirin-free regimens (3%, 95% CI 0–9%). This study suggests that SOF-based regimens 
in the treatment of HCV infection among hemodialysis patients are both effective and safe.
Patients requiring hemodialysis are at an increased risk of acquiring hepatitis C virus (HCV)1
. Approximately 
5% of patients on hemodialysis are diagnosed with HCV, compared to 1% in the United States population2,3
 and, 
among hemodialysis patients, HCV infection is associated with poor outcomes with substantially higher rates 
of hepatic-related mortality and hospitalizations, and lower health-related quality of life scores, compared to 
HCV negative hemodialysis patients4
.
National guidelines for the treatment of HCV infection among hemodialysis patients recommend several 
direct-acting antivirals (DAA)5,6
. Sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens are not recommended for patients requiring 
hemodialysis since renal clearance of SOF is the major elimination pathway, although since the recent U.S. Federal 
Drug Administration change in label, removing restrictions on its use in renal impairment, this will undoubtedly 
change7
. Nevertheless, clinical studies provide evidence that use of SOF, among HCV positive patients with renal 
impairment, is effective and safe8,9
. Data focusing only on patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis are lim￾ited. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy and safety of SOF-based 
regimens among the subset of patients with severe renal impairment that required maintenance hemodialysis.

Czech Republic11, Korea13, Iraq26, and 1 enrolled patients from multiple countries23. All studies received more 
than five stars in the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and no study was excluded due to quality concerns.
The overall pooled estimate of the efficacy of SOF-based therapy among HCV positive patients on mainte￾nance hemodialysis was 95% (95% CI 91–98%), ranging from 73 to 100% (Fig. 2). There was moderate hetero￾geneity among studies (I2=40.3%, p<0.05). A meta-regression analysis did not demonstrate any evidence that 
the differences in gender, age, HCV genotypes, or type of SOF-based regimens among studies were correlated 
with the between study heterogeneity (p = 0.97). Egger’s test for publication bias yielded insignificant results 
(bias=− 0.76, p=0.46), suggesting absence of small-study effects.
A total of 19 studies reported extractable data on the SOF dose10–14,16–29 and the other DAA included in the 
treatment regimen. In nine studies10–13,16,19,21–23, the same treatment regimen was used for all study participants. 
Six studies partitioned the study participants into subgroups and followed a different treatment strategy for each 
subgroup14,17,18,20,24,25. Each treatment strategy was considered as a separate observation in our analysis and was 
included separately in its respective subgroup.
The efficacy from the studies that reported extractable data on the treatment regimen used varied from 50 to 
100% (Fig. 3). Studies were sub-grouped based on the SOF-dose administered. The pooled efficacy of the sofos￾buvir regimen was 92% (95% CI 80–99%) in patients administered a 400 mg alternate day dose, 98% (95% CI 
96–100%) in those administered a 400 mg daily dose, and 100% (95% CI 95–100%) in patients administered a 
200 mg daily dose (Fig. 3). A sub-group analysis was not performed for the various other DAA used in the treat￾ment regimens, due to the large variability of DAA used. Ribavirin was used in 6 studies10,13,14,16,18,28, simeprevir 
in 315,17,21, ledipasvir in 817,20–22,25–27,29, daclatasvir in 910,11,14,16–20,24–29 and velpatasvir in 2 studies12,23 (Table 1).
Six studies included extractable data on the efficacy of SOF-based therapy in patients with cirrhosis11,12,17–19,24. 
The pooled estimate of the efficacy of SOF-based therapy among HCV positive patients on maintenance hemo￾dialysis with cirrhosis was 97% (95% CI 84–100%), ranging from 67 to 100% (Supplementary Fig. 1).
A total of 16 studies reported extractable data on adverse events10–14,16–19,21–23,25,27–29 (Table 2). The most com￾monly reported adverse events were anemia (10 studies)10,12–14,16–18,21,23,28, headache (8 studies)12,17,21–23,25,27,29, 
fatigue (6 studies)13,16,17,19,23,25, nausea or vomiting (5 studies)19,21,23,25,29, insomnia (5 studies)13,19,21,23,29 and rash 
or itching (4 studies)13,17,21,29. The most frequent adverse event was fatigue with an overall pooled prevalence of 
16% (95% CI 5–29%) (Fig. 4). Anemia ranged from 0 to 56%, with an overall pooled prevalence of 15% (95% CI 
3–31%) (Fig. 5). Anemia was more prevalent in treatment regimens containing ribavirin (46%, 95% CI 33–59%) 
compared to regimens that did not contain ribavirin (3%, 95% CI 0–9%). The overall pooled prevalence of head￾ache was 7% (95% CI 3–13%), nausea or vomiting 14% (95% CI 4–27%), insomnia 3% (95% CI 0–8%), rash or 
itching 7% (95% CI 0–18%). Two studies reported drug discontinuation due to adverse events18,24. Cheema et al. 
reported a treatment related serious adverse event (drug induced rash) in 1 patient24, and Gupta et al. reported 
that 1 patient developed recurrent hypoglycemia which improved after stopping therapy18.

Discussion
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of SOF-based regimens 
in the treatment of HCV infection among patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis. Among the 934 studies 
that were identified in our database search, 20 studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled estimate 
of efficacy, based on SVR12, was 95%, ranging from 73 to 100%. Using meta-regression analyses, no statistically 
significant differences were identified for patient demographics, use of different types of DAA in addition to 
SOF, or HCV genotypes. Among the studies that reported the dose of SOF, no statistically significant differences 
in SVR12 were noted with pooled estimates of 92%, 98%, and 100% for SOF doses of 400 mg on alternate days, 
400 mg daily and 200 mg daily, respectively.
Among the studies that reported adverse events, anemia was the most common with a pooled prevalence of 
15%. A total of 10 (50%) studies reported anemia as an adverse event. Among these, 6 (60%) included ribavirin 
in the SOF-based regimens. Since ribavirin frequently causes anemia, a subset analysis was performed to com￾pare rates of anemia among ribavirin and ribavirin-free regimens30. The prevalence of anemia was significantly 
higher in regimens containing ribavirin (46%) compared to ribavirin-free regimens (3%). Other adverse events 
identified in this meta-analysis, included fatigue, rash or itching, headaches, insomnia and nausea or vomiting 
with pooled estimates of 16%, 7%, 7%,3% and 14%, respectively.
Several large-scale studies evaluated the efficacy and safety among patients with HCV infection and severe 
renal impairment, treated with SOF-based regimens8,9
. A longitudinal prospective study by Saxena et al. com￾pared outcomes of HCV infection between 1716 pts with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)>45 ml/
min/1.73 m2
 to 73 patients with an eGFR≤45, of which five were on hemodialysis. Patients were treated with 
SOF 400 mg daily and 60% also received ribavirin. Among patients with eGFR≤45, SVR12 was achieved among 
83% of patients. Reported rates of adverse events, in this subset of patients, were similar to our study, with ane￾mia, fatigue and headaches occurring in 30%, 30% and 14% of patients, respectively. Rash or itching was not

. A meta-analysis by Li et al. evaluated studies of SOF-based regimens among HCV positive patients 
with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m2
). Their outcome of efficacy combined SVR 
at 12 and 24 weeks. Twenty-one studies were included, with a total of 717 HCV infected patients, of whom 
306 (58.4%) were on either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Doses of SOF varied and a subset also received 
ribavirin. Among patients requiring dialysis, the pooled SVR12/24 was 95%. Rates of anemia, fatigue, headache, 
rash or itching were not reported8
. Lastly, in November 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
updated the prescribing of several SOF-based regimens, which now states that no dosage adjustment is required 
for patients with any degree of renal impairment. In the updated labeling report for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, for 
example, the FDA reported an overall SVR of 95% among 59 patients requiring hemodialysis and peritoneal 
dialysis. Adverse events were not provided31. Our findings support the notion that the use of Sofosbuvir based 
regimens in patients receiving hemodialysis is both safe and effective. In our analysis, hemodialysis did not

seem to be an unfavorable factor, in terms of safety and efficacy, when compared to other meta-analyses which 
included Hepatitis C patients without renal disease32,33.
There are several limitations that warrant discussion. First, substantial heterogeneity was found among stud￾ies, which we addressed by using a random effects model instead of a fixed effects model. Furthermore, meta￾regression analysis of specific variables, including patient demographics, HCV genotype and SOF dose did not 
identify any statistically significant differences. Second, although some publications reported lower SVR rates 
based on different SOF-based regimens, a subset analyses of types of SOF-based regimens and a comparison of 
NS5A and NS3 protease inhibitor regimens could not be performed due to the small number of studies in each 
group. Future studies will need to compare differences in efficacy and safety among SOF-based regimens using 
different DAA. Third, efficacy by specific HCV genotype could not be determined, again due to the small number 
of patients and that data pertaining to specific genotypes and outcomes were not extractable.
In conclusion, our findings support that the use of SOF-based regimens in the treatment of HCV infection 
among patients requiring hemodialysis is both safe and effective. Future randomized controlled studies are 
needed to confirm these results and to evaluate the optimal SOF-based treatment regimen.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA)34 and has been registered in PROSPERO 
(CRD42018116632, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).
Search strategy. A systematic search of Pubmed and Embase databases was performed to identify studies 
reporting the efficacy and safety of SOF-based regimens for the treatment of HCV positive patients on mainte￾nance hemodialysis. The following search term was used: (end stage renal disease OR renal replacement therapy 
OR chronic kidney failure OR severe renal impairment OR chronic kidney disease OR hemodialysis) AND 
(sofosbuvir). Results were limited to the English language and publication dates until May 22, 2020. Additionally, 
references of systematic reviews focusing on HCV treatment were reviewed manually.
Eligibility criteria and study selection. Two reviewers (KB and EMCD) independently screened and 
evaluated the studies that were potentially eligible for inclusion with discrepancies were resolved either between 
the two reviewers or a third party (FS), if consensus could not be reached. Studies were included if they reported 
extractable data on the number of maintenance hemodialysis patients that completed a SOF-based regimen and 
had values for a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of treatment (SVR12). Our primary 
outcome of interest was the efficacy of SOF-based therapy in HCV positive patients on maintenance hemodi￾alysis. Regimen efficacy was defined as the proportion of patients that had SVR12. As a secondary outcome of 
interest, we evaluated the safety of SOF-based regimens, by quantifying the proportion of patients with reported 
adverse events.
Studies that reported only aggregate data on patients, regardless of their dependency on hemodialysis, were 
excluded as were opinion pieces and conference abstracts. Studies that focused on patients<18 years old, HIV 
positive patients or transplant recipients were also excluded. SOF-based regimens that included pegylated inter￾feron were also excluded.

Data extraction and quality assessment. For each included study, we extracted the following infor￾mation: study period, country, type of study, age, gender, HCV genotype, number of patients on a SOF-based 
therapy, other DAA used in treatment regimen, SOF dose, number of patients who had SVR12, and adverse 
events. Data extraction was performed by FS and checked for accuracy by EMCD.
We assessed the quality of the eligible studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale35. A maximum of six stars 
could be assigned to each study, as the parameters “selection of the non-exposed cohort” and “comparability 
between cohorts” were not applicable to our analysis. High quality studies were defined as studies that received≥5 
stars (Supplementary Table 1).
Data synthesis and analysis. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effi￾cacy of SOF-based therapy in HCV positive patients on dialysis, using the DerSimonian and Laird approach36. 
The Freeman Tukey double arcsine transformation was used to stabilize the variances37. We selected a random

effects model, because we assumed that the effects are heterogeneous due to differences in the study design, SOF 
dosage and combination drugs of each study. Studies were grouped by regimen dosage where possible, and a ran￾dom effects meta-analysis was carried out in these sub-groups. We assessed the heterogeneity among studies and 
subgroups using the I
2 statistic38. The Egger’s test was used to explore publication bias and small study effects39.
To evaluate the safety of the SOF-based regimens, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis for each 
adverse event reported in 3 or more studies, and estimated the pooled proportion of patients that reported each 
adverse event. A meta-regression analysis was also conducted to investigate the extent to which the differences in 
study characteristics were correlated with the between study heterogeneity40. For our review, we used an intention 
to treat analysis. Patients lost to follow-up were considered as treatment failures.
Stata v15 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis. The 
statistical significance threshold was set at 0.05.
