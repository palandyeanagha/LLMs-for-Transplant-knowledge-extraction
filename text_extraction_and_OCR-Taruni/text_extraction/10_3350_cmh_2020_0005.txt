Serum myokines, sarcopenia, and survival in HCC
http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2020.0005
INTRODUCTION
Sarcopenia, defined as a decline in skeletal muscle mass and 
strength, is increasingly important in the aging society. Currently, 
the measurement of appendicular lean mass using bioelectrical 
impedance analysis (BIA) or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is 
the standard diagnostic modality of sarcopenia, which is stratified 
by gender. Evaluation of hand grip strength or gait speed provides 
additional accuracy for the diagnosis of sarcopenia.1,2
However, diagnosis of sarcopenia is not simple. The cut-off for 
those diagnostic criteria varies according to the race or country 
because of different physiques. Usually, the cut-off value has been 
set as below 2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean for young 
adults or as being in the bottom quintile, resulting in different 
cut-off values among various populations.3,4 Moreover, BIA may 
not be accurate for the diagnosis of sarcopenia in patients with 
chronic liver disease with ascites or edema, such as liver cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver transplantation.5,6 In 
those patients, diagnosis of sarcopenia is important because of its 
deleterious role in the outcomes, which can be intervened upon 
by reinforcement of nutrition and exercise.7
Aside from the measurement of muscle mass and muscle 
strength, several serum biomarkers related to sarcopenia are be￾ing developed. There are many adipomyokines, secreted by skele￾tal myocytes or adipocytes, including muscle growth inhibitors 
(interleukin-6 [IL-6], myostatin, activins A/B, growth and differen￾tiation factor 15) and muscle growth promoters (follistatin, irisin, 
bone morphogenetic protein [BMPs], and brain-derived neuro￾trophic factor).8-11 A recent study from Japan suggested the use of 
the serum myostatin level as a potential biomarker, showing that 
a high myostatin level was associated with sarcopenia and a re￾duced survival rate in liver cirrhosis patients.12
However, there have been no studies that have measured the 
serum levels of those adipomyokines among HCC patients, al￾though sarcopenia is an independent factor for poor survival in 
HCC regardless of the stage of the tumor, degree of liver function, 
or cirrhotic status.7
 The aim of this study was to investigate the 
serum levels of myostatin, follistatin, and IL-6, and to evaluate 
Background/Aims: The role of serum myokine levels in sarcopenia and the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
patients are not clear. This study investigated the serum levels of myostatin, follistatin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HCC 
patients and their association with sarcopenia and survival.
Methods: Using prospectively collected pretreatment samples from 238 HCC patients in a hospital from 2012 to 2015, 
the serum levels of 3 myokines were determined and compared to 50 samples from age and sex-matched healthy 
controls. Sarcopenia was evaluated using the psoas muscle index (PMI) measured at the third lumbar level in the 
computed tomography, and clinical data were collected until 2017.
Results: The median levels of the 3 myokines for the male and female HCC patients were as follow: myostatin (3,979.3 
and 2,976.3 pg/mL), follistatin (2,118.5 and 2,174.6 pg/mL), and IL-6 (2.5 and 2.7 pg/mL), respectively. Those in the HCC 
patients were all significantly higher than in the healthy controls. In the HCC patient, the median PMI was 4.43 (males) 
and 2.17 cm2
/m2
 (females) with a sarcopenic prevalence of 56.4%. The serum levels of myostatin, IL-6 and follistatin in the 
HCC patients showed a positive, negative, and no correlation with PMI, respectively. The serum follistatin level was an 
independent factor for poor survival in HCC patients.
Conclusions: The serum levels of myostatin, follistatin, and IL-6 and their correlation with sarcopenia and survival were 
presented in HCC patients for the first time. The role of the serum follistatin level as a poor prognostic biomarker warrants 
further study. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:492-505)

PATIENTS AND METHODS
HCC patients and healthy controls
We prospectively enrolled 258 newly diagnosed HCC patients 
at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2012 
to December 2015, and followed them up until December 2017. 
After the exclusion of 20 patients whose serum samples were not 
available, 238 patients with HCC were the final subjects of this 
study. HCC was diagnosed according to histological findings or 
typical imaging characteristics as defined by the Korean Liver 
Cancer Study Group and National Cancer Center guidelines, which 
are similar to international guidelines.13 All of the subjects provided 
written informed consent, and this study was approved by the In￾stitutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Bun￾dang Hospital (B-1810-497-301). All methods were performed in 
accordance with national guidelines and regulation. Plasma samples 
from 50 healthy controls, which were matched for age and sex to 
the HCC patients, were obtained from a repository that included 
anonymized clinical data after IRB approval (B-1307/210-006).
Clinical data collection and follow up of the subjects 
The clinical data at the diagnosis of HCC were entered into a 
predefined electronic case report form, which included age, sex, 
height, weight, alcohol intake, smoking history, performance sta￾tus, etiology of HCC, comorbidities, blood levels of alpha-fetopro￾tein (AFP), albumin, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ala￾nine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, prothrombin time expressed 
as international normalized ratio, platelet count, creatinine, sodi￾um, Child-Pugh score and class, model for end stage liver disease 
(MELD) score, tumor size, number, vascular invasion, TNM stage 
based on American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th edition,14 and 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage.15
The patients were prospectively followed for a median duration 
of 31.8 months until December 2017. The assessment of tumor re￾sponse after treatment followed the modified Response Evalua￾tion Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria using dynamic contrast en￾hanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and complete remission was defined as disappear￾ance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target le￾sions. Recurrence of HCC was defined as the development of any 
new lesions or a new enhancing portion in the treated target le￾sion, and confirmed by medical records and CT or MRI images. 
The death of each patient was confirmed by a request to the Sta￾tistics Korea, and the cause of death was confirmed through a re￾view of the medical records.
Measurement of the psoas muscle area, calculation 
of the psoas muscle index (PMI) and determination 
of the cut-off for sarcopenia in HCC patients
Multiphase CT scans were performed within 60 days of the di￾agnosis. We used a multidetector-row CT machine (Brilliance 64 
or iCT256; Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA) for con￾trast enhancement CT examinations. Using a power injector (Stel￾lant D, Medrad, Indianola, PA, USA), an intravenous non-ionic 
contrast material (2 mL/kg, iomeprol; 350 mg iodine/mL, Iomeron 
350; Bracco, Milano, Italy) was administered through the antecu￾bital vein. 
The 2-dimensional cross-sectional area of the bilateral psoas 
muscles on the pre-contrast enhanced phase image was mea￾sured at the middle level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). We 
used the Rapidia 3D software (v2.8; INFINITT Healthcare, Seoul, 
Korea) to outline the psoas muscle boundary. The borders of the 
psoas muscles were manually outlined at a setting from 31 to 100 
Hounsfield Units to exclude more strictly the vasculature and ar￾eas of fatty infiltration.16-19 The measured psoas muscle area was 
divided by the patient height squared for the calculation of the 
PMI (cm2
/m2
). For the measurement of the PMI, one fellow re￾searcher (HYJ) and one research nurse (SHH) independently mea￾sured the same group of CT images from 20 randomly selected 
patients and compared the results. The interobserver agreement 
was 97%, and then, the research nurse completed the measure￾ment of the whole series of CT images from the subjects.
To determine the sex-specific cut-offs of the PMI for defining 
sarcopenia, we used the R software package (version 3.3.2; R 
Foundation for statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://
www.R-project.org/) for optimum stratification which found the 
most significant value by using the log-rank chi-square statis￾tic.20,21 The cut-off values for the PMI were set at 4.98 cm2
/m2
 for 
male patients, and 1.17 cm2
/m2
 for female patients.
Blood sample storage and measurement of the 
serum levels of myostatin, follistatin, and IL-6
Blood samples were collected from the HCC patients before

treatment, and serum aliquots were stored at -70°C until the time 
of the measurement. Serum or plasma levels of myostatin, fol￾listatin and IL-6 in the healthy controls and HCC patients were as￾sessed using the commercial Quantikine ELISA Immunoassays 
(R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the manu￾facturer’s instructions and done in duplicates by an experienced 
researcher (YSC).
Statistical analysis
The data were presented as the mean±SD or the median with 
the interquartile range for continuous variables, and as a number 
and percentage for categorical variables. Student’s independent t￾test (continuous parametric variables) and Pearson’s chi-square 
(categorical variables) were used to compare the two groups. A 
two-tailed P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signifi￾cant. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to find the correlation 
between the PMI and the level of myostatin, follistatin and IL-6,

and the coefficient of the correlation was indicated as Spearman’s 
rho (ρ).
Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were analyzed with 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and the log-rank test was used to compare 
the survival between the two groups. To determine the indepen￾dent factors for the overall survival of the HCC patients, univariate 
and multivariate analyses were performed. For the multivariable 
analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model, we put the 
variables, that had P<0.1 for the correlation with mortality in the 
univariable analysis and selected the most fitted final multivari￾able model. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
Statistics (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the HCC patients and 
healthy controls
The baseline characteristics of the 238 HCC patients and 50 
healthy controls are summarized in Table 1. There were no miss￾ing data for any variables among the HCC patients in Table 1. The 
HCC patients had a median age of 59 years; 81% were male; 
70% had hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen positivity, and 
the median body mass index (BMI) was 23.7 kg/m2
. The Child￾Pugh class was A in 85.7% and B in 14.3%, and there was no 
class C in this study. The median tumor size was 3.5 cm in diame￾ter, and the BCLC stage 0, A, B, and C were 18.1%, 39.9%, 
18.1%, and 23.9%, respectively. The high proportion of HCC pa￾tients receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) could be 
explained as the availability of superselective TACE experts in this 
center, and as such, physicians and patients tended to prefer 
TACE to resection as the first treatment with curative intention, 
especially in the case of old age, marginal liver function or more 
than one lesion number.
During a median follow-up of 31.9 months, 45 patients died 
(18.9%). The median overall survival was 31.9 months (range, 
1.1–67.9), and the median recurrence-free survival was 19.5 
months (range, 0.7–66.4).
The 50 plasma samples were obtained from a remote repository 
of health check examinees showing normal laboratory results and 
diagnosed as healthy persons; their median age was 64 years, 
and the male proportion was 80%.
Serum levels of myostatin, follistatin and IL-6 and 
their relationship with the PMI according to gender 
in the HCC patients
The median serum levels of myostatin, follistatin and IL-6 in the 
50 healthy controls (3,150.8, 1,248.4, and 0.81 pg/mL, respec￾tively) and 238 HCC patients (3,816.3, 2,131.2, and 2.52 pg/mL, 
respectively) are summarized in Table 2. The serum levels of the 
above 3 cytokines were all significantly higher in the HCC patients 
than in the healthy controls. Moreover, the serum median levels 
of myostatin were higher in the male (3,979.3 pg/mL) than in the 
female HCC patients (2,976.3 pg/mL) (P<0.001), while both the 
follistatin and IL-6 levels were not significantly different between 
the male and female HCC patients. All the serum levels of the 3 
myokines of the HCC patients and healthy controls are plotted in 
Supplementary Figure 1.

ing that the myostatin level increased with increasing muscle 
mass, though the correlation was weak. In contrast, the serum 
IL-6 levels showed a weakly negative correlation with the PMI 
(ρ=-0.174, P=0.009), such that the IL-6 levels increased with pro￾gressive sarcopenia. The serum follistatin levels tended to be neg￾atively correlated with the PMI (ρ=-0.124, P=0.055) with border￾line statistical significance, but it was significantly correlated in 
female patients (ρ=-0.316, P=0.034; Supplementary Table 1).
Among the 3 myokines, the IL-6 levels showed a negative cor￾relation with the myostatin (ρ=-0.288, P<0.0001) and a positive 
correlation with the follistatin level (ρ=0.422, P<0.0001). The se￾rum myostatin level was negatively correlated with the follistatin 
level significantly (ρ=-0.218, P=0.0007, Supplementary Fig. 2).
Serum levels of myostatin, follistatin and IL-6 and 
their relationship with liver function and tumor 
extent in HCC patients
The serum levels of those 3 cytokines according to the liver 
function in terms of the Child-Pugh class and tumor stage are 
summarized in Figure 2. Compared to the patients with Child 
Pugh class A, the patients with Child Pugh class B had a signifi￾cantly increased level of follistatin (P=0.002), IL-6 (P=0.002), and 
myostatin (P=0.006).
According to tumor progression by TNM stage or BCLC stage, 
the serum follistatin and IL-6 levels remarkably increased, espe￾cially for TNM stage 4 or BCLC stage C. However, the serum level 
of myostatin decreased in TNM stage 4 or BCLC stage C, showing 
that the trend was not clearly defined.
Serum levels of myostatin, follistatin and IL-6 and 
their relationship with survival in HCC patients
When the HCC patients were divided into two groups (high￾and low-level groups) based on the median serum level of myo￾statin, follistatin, and IL-6, the overall survival curves between the 
high- or low-level group are summarized in Figure 3. While the 
overall 5-year survival rate was not different between the high 
(74.8%) and low myostatin (68.0%) group (P=0.062), the high 
follistatin group had a significantly lower 5-year overall survival

serum myostatin levels, (B) serum follistatin levels, (C) serum IL-6 levels. 
Spearman’s rank correlation was used to find the correlation between 
the PMI and the level of myostatin, follistatin and IL-6, and the coefficient 
of the correlation was indicated as Spearman’s rho (ρ). Serum myostatin 
levels showed a positive and linear correlation with PMI, though the cor￾relation was weak (ρ=0.356, P<0.001). In contrast, the serum IL-6 levels 
showed a negative association with the PMI, which was also a weak cor￾relation (ρ=-0.174, P=0.009). The serum follistatin levels were not corre￾lated with the PMI. PMI, psoas muscle index; IL-6, interleukin-6.

P<0.001). Likewise, the high IL-6 group had a significantly shorter 
5-year overall survival rate (78.4%) than that of the low IL-6 
group (85.8%, P=0.018).
For the recurrence-free survival, the high follistatin group 
showed a significantly poor survival than that of the low follistatin 
group, while the myostatin and IL-6 levels did not show a signifi￾cant difference (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Univariate and multivariate analyses of the 
parameters contributing to the overall survival
The results of the univariable and multivariable analyses are 
summarized in Table 4. In the univariable analysis, current alcohol 
intake (P=0.047), serum AFP (P=0.033), albumin (P=0.002), fol￾listatin (P=0.034), and IL-6 (P=0.021) levels, MELD score 
(P=0.005), ECOG performance stage (P=0.001), TNM stage 
(P<0.001), and presence of sarcopenia (P=0.012) were signifi￾cantly associated with the overall survival. The overall survival be￾tween sarcopenic group and non-sarcopenic group is shown in 
Figure 4. 
Multivariable analysis showed that the follistatin level (hazard 
ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13 to 4.30; 
P=0.020) and the presence of sarcopenia (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07 
to 4.17; P=0.031) remained statistically significant along with the 
MELD score (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.01; P=0.013), and TNM 
stage (HR, 9.46; 95% CI, 3.33 to 26.9; P<0.001). Therefore, the 
serum follistatin level was an independent factor associated with 
the overall survival. However, it was not independently associated 
with recurrence-free survival (data not shown).

TNM or BCLC stage, especially in TNM stage 4 or BCLC stage C. However, 
the serum level of myostatin decreased in TNM stage 4 or BCLC stage C,

DISCUSSION 
This study evaluated the serum levels of myostatin, follistatin 
and IL-6 among HCC patients, and they all were significantly 
higher than in the healthy controls. The sarcopenic prevalence in 
terms of a low PMI using a gender-specific cut-off was 56% in 
the Korean HCC patients at our center, where HBV is the major 
cause of HCC. Unexpectedly, the serum myostatin levels increased 
with increasing muscle mass, while serum IL-6 levels increased 
with progressive sarcopenia, suggesting that myostatin may not 
have a role in inducing sarcopenia, while IL-6 did, and myostatin 
may be downregulated in response to sarcopenia in HCC patients. 
Both the follistatin and IL-6 levels increased with the tumor stage 
(TNM and BCLC staging systems), while the serum myostatin level 
did not. Interestingly, the serum follistatin level was an indepen￾dent factor for the overall survival of the HCC patients, while the 
myostatin or IL-6 level was not.
Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor beta 
(TGF-beta) family and the first known cytokine to be a negative 
regulator of muscles.22-24 In mice, an increased serum level of 
myostatin caused muscle atrophy, and a prolonged absence of 
myostatin reduces sarcopenia. However, a study that included 66 
Scottish men showed that the serum myostatin level was not sig￾nificantly different among young subjects, mildly sarcopenic and 
severely sarcopenic elderly subjects. Moreover, low serum myo￾statin levels were associated with a low skeletal muscle mass in 
healthy community-living older men, but not in women.25
In Japanese cirrhosis patients (median age of 68 years; 55% 
males; 62% Child-Pugh class A, 20% HCC patients included), 
higher serum myostatin levels showed a negative correlation with 
Figure 3. Overall survival rate in regards to the serum levels of (A) myo￾statin, (B) follistatin, and (C) serum IL-6. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 
the overall 5-year survival rate was not different between the high 
(74.8%) and low myostatin (68.0%) group (P=0.062) (A). However, the 
high follistatin group had a significantly shorter 5-year overall survival 
rate (78.4%) than that of the low follistatin group (89.6%, P<0.001) (B). 
Likewise, the high IL-6 group had a significantly shorter 5-year overall 
survival rate (78.4%) than that of the low IL-6 group (85.8%, P=0.018) (C).

rate.12 In a rat portacaval anastomosis model that reproduces a 
similar metabolic change to liver cirrhosis, sarcopenia was associ￾ated with portosystemic shunting. In this model, sarcopenia was 
caused by increased myostatin expression, impaired muscle pro￾tein synthesis and satellite cell (myocyte precursor) dysfunction, 
which was reversed by follistatin.26

years; 81% male; 85% Child-Pugh class A), the serum myostatin 
levels showed a positive correlation with the PMI and were not a 
significant factor for overall survival. The mechanism of this dis￾crepancy between cirrhosis and HCC is not clear, but the develop￾ment of HCC may change the regulatory pathway of myostatin se￾cretion. In agreement with our results, the serum myostatin level 
was decreased in various cancer cachexia showing a positive cor￾relation with muscle mass.27,28 Cancer is a chronic state of energy 
malnutrition, which may increase the expression of a splice variant 
of myostatin leading to decreased bioavailability of myostatin and 
protection from sarcopenia.29
Likewise, in Japanese heart-failure patients (n=41), the serum 
myostatin levels were significantly lower than in the healthy con￾trols and again showed a positive correlation with muscle mass, 
suggesting that myostatin may have a compensatory action for 
maintaining skeletal muscle mass.30 In the murine model of cancer 
cachexia, myostatin expression was upregulated in the muscle of 
the animals, and blocking of the shared receptor of myostatin and 
activin, activin type II receptor B, prevented muscle atrophy and 
increased survival.31 However, the regulation of myostatin expres￾sion in humans is so complex that further investigation is needed.32
Follistatin is a multifunctional regulatory protein, mainly secret￾ed from the liver. The primary function of follistatin is the antago￾nism effect on the TGF-beta superfamily, including myostatin, ac￾tivin and BMPs.33-35 It is a strong inhibitor of myostatin-mediated 
sarcopenia, and follistatin-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit 
a significant increase in muscle mass. Therefore, follistatin or fol￾listatin mimetics have been tried in preclinical use for treating 
muscle injury, atrophy or sarcopenia.36 Moreover, overexpression 
of follistatin was found in rodent and human HCC tumors, and 
experimentally administered follistatin has a role in tumor growth 
promotion and escaping from the tumor suppressive effect of ac￾tivin or TGF-beta signaling pathways.37-39 TGF-beta signaling 
showed a tumor suppressive effect in the early stages of carcino￾genesis, while it later contributes to tumor progression, showing a 
contextual regulation in HCC.40 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
can produce TGF-beta and IL-10, which lead to immunosuppres￾sive milieu in HCC tissues and the development of the immune es￾cape of HCC cells.41 The deregulation of the activin/follistatin sys￾tem may be important during hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, 
the follistatin level increased with the tumor stage, higher AFP 
levels and tumor size, suggesting an oncogenic role of follistatin 
overexpression according to the HCC progression. It is supported 
by several studies showing that follistatin regulates tumor angio￾genesis, metastasis, and cell apoptosis.42
Moreover, the serum follistatin level was an independent factor 
for poor survival in the HCC patients, which was compatible with 
the results of Tomoda et al.42 who reported that the serum fol￾listatin level in HCC patients was independently correlated with a 
poor prognosis. Meanwhile, follistatin serves as a stress respon￾sive protein, having a protective role under oxidative stress, physi￾cal stress, and cellular energy deficiency such as prolonged fast￾ing, acute exercise, or solid cancers. Solid cancers including HCC 
are exposed to glucose deficiency and a hypoxic microenviron￾ment, which results in a compensatory high expression of fol￾listatin, which may be related to our findings. The overwhelming 
excretion of follistatin may exert a suppression of myostatin, lead￾ing to a protective effect on sarcopenia in the HCC patients.
IL-6 mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
activation promote hepatocarcinogenesis, and IL-6 is a determi￾nant of gender disparity for HCC development because estrogen 
inhibits the release of IL-6 from Kupffer cells, showing a reduced 
risk of HCC development in women compared to men.43 The cellu￾lar sources of IL-6 in HCC are the tumor-associated macrophages 
and HCC cells. IL-6 is a marker of inflammation with catabolic ef￾fects on muscle proteins, and contributes to the progression of 
sarcopenia.44,45 According to a recent meta-analysis, the serum 
levels for IL-6 correlates negatively with muscle strength in healthy 
elderly populations.46 Moreover, many studies have consistently 
reported that IL-6 has an important effect on the development of 
sarcopenia and cachexia and promoting tumor growth and me￾tastasis in cancer patients including HCC. In this study, the serum 
levels of IL-6 showed a significant negative correlation with the

the patients with non-sarcopenia.

PMI and a progressive increase with increasing cancer stage. 
Therefore, IL-6 may have a major role in the sarcopenia of HCC 
patients. Whether therapeutic trials aimed at the reduction of the 
IL-6 activity, such as endurance exercise or anti-IL-6 antibodies, 
may be beneficial for cancer associated sarcopenia in humans 
need to be studied further.47 In the aspect of HCC as the ultimate 
outcome of liver fibrosis, IL-6 has a profibrogenic role, and myo￾statin seems to be fibrogenic,48 while follistatin may attenuate fi￾brosis,37 which warrants further studies.
There are some limitations in this study. First, it was a single 
center study with the measurement of only 3 myokines at one sin￾gle time of the HCC diagnosis. The serum ammonia level was 
closely linked to the development of sarcopenia, however, the se￾rum ammonia level was not measured in this study. Second, only 
the amount of muscle but not the function or quality of the mus￾cle was evaluated. It would be interesting to explore the associa￾tion between muscle strength and the 3 myokines. Third, we de￾termined the optimal cut-offs for defining prognostic sarcopenia 
from our own cohort; thus, the cut-off may overestimate the 
prognostic separation. It would be necessary to validate the cut￾off values in an independent cohort. Lastly, total skeletal muscle 
index was not measured, which remains a possible underestima￾tion of mortality risk by using PMI, as shown in cirrhosis pa￾tients.49 Sarcopenia is already a well-known factor for poor survival 
in HCC; therefore, our study mainly focused on the simultaneous 
measurement of the 3 myokines and the PMI in HCC patients for 
the first time to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, by compari￾son of those 3 myokines to the age and sex-matched healthy con￾trols, the higher levels of the 3 myokines in HCC patients were 
clearly demonstrated.
In conclusion, the serum levels of myostatin, follistatin, and IL-6 
in association with the PMI in HCC patients were presented. The 
serum myostatin level was negatively, and the IL-6 level was posi￾tively correlated with sarcopenia, while the serum follistatin level 
showed no correlation. The serum follistatin level was an inde￾pendent factor for poor survival in HCC patients, which warrants 
further study.
