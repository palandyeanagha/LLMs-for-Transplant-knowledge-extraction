Abstract
The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) as important regulators of gene expression have been studied intensively. Although most
of these investigations have involved the highly expressed form of the two mature miRNA species, increasing evidence
points to essential roles for star-form microRNAs (miRNA*), which are usually expressed at much lower levels. Owing to the
nature of miRNA biogenesis, it is challenging to use plasmids containing miRNA coding sequences for gain-of-function
experiments concerning the roles of microRNA* species. Synthetic microRNA mimics could introduce specific miRNA*
species into cells, but this transient overexpression system has many shortcomings. Here, we report that specific miRNA*
species can be overexpressed by introducing artificially designed stem-loop sequences into short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
overexpression vectors. By our prototypic plasmid, designed to overexpress hsa-miR-146b-3p, we successfully expressed
high levels of hsa-miR-146b-3p without detectable change of hsa-miR-146b-5p. Functional analysis involving luciferase
reporter assays showed that, like natural miRNAs, the overexpressed hsa-miR-146b-3p inhibited target gene expression by
39UTR seed pairing. Our demonstration that this method could overexpress two other miRNAs suggests that the approach
should be broadly applicable. Our novel strategy opens the way for exclusively stable overexpression of miRNA* species and
analyzing their unique functions both in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs,
which are ,22 nucleotides (nt) long and play important regulatory
roles in many biological functions in plants and animals [1].
MiRNAs can influence the expression levels of many proteins
mainly by targeting mRNAs for degradation or translational
repression [2,3]. Besides, many new findings, such as miRNAs
could promote mRNA translation [4,5] or even participate in the
regulation of mRNA transcription [6,7], were added to the
complexity of the mechanisms which were used by miRNAs to
shape gene expression. Thus, miRNAs are involved in a wide
range of physiological and pathological processes [8,9,10].
The genomic DNA sequences that encode miRNAs are located
mostly in introns or intergenic regions [11]. After transcription by
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), the first step in the biogenesis of
miRNA involves the cleavage of the primary miRNA transcript
(pri-miRNA) by Drosha in the nucleus to produce a ,60–100 nt
hairpin-like structure called the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA).
The pre-miRNA is subsequently transported out of the nucleus by
Exportin-5, where it is further processed by Dicer to generate a
,22 nt duplex RNA product. Finally, one strand of the duplex is
incorporated into the Argonaut-containing RNA-induced silenc￾ing complex (RISC) [12]. Incorporation into RISC is a biased
process that one strand of the duplex is preferred to be associated
with RISC and accumulates to a higher steady-state level than the
other strand which is variously called either the passenger strand
or the miRNA* species [13,14] (Note that: If there were not
enough data to determine which one was expressed predominant￾ly, the mature sequences would be assigned names by adding 25p
(from the 59 arm) and 23p (from the 39 arm) to the end. So, the
miRNA* species could be originally named 25p or 23p) [15].
Since the discovery that miRNAs are found in many species and
expressed ubiquitously in nearly all tissues and organs [1,16],
considerable effort has been devoted to explore the function of
miRNAs during health and disease. However, most investigations
have focused on the more highly expressed of the two mature
sequences and less attention has been paid to the passenger strand
and it was thought to be degraded soon after processing. Thus, the
potential regulatory activity of miRNA* species has been
comparatively underestimated. Nonetheless, several studies have
demonstrated the existence of miRNA* species in different
organisms [17,18,19,20,21,22,23], and accumulated to substantial
levels in certain tissues under physiological conditions or in some
cell type with specific stimulation [24,25,26]. Indeed, certain
miRNA* species associate with RISC [27,28], function like their

highly expressed counterparts [26,29], and are implicated in the
pathogenesis of some diseases or in regulating signaling events
[24,30,31].
Gain-of function experiments are frequently used to explore the
regulatory functions of miRNAs. Until now, miRNAs have been
overexpressed either by transfecting cells with synthetic miRNA
mimics or by introducing miRNA expression plasmids into cells
[32]. Synthetic miRNA mimics have the ability to specifically
elevate levels of miRNA* species. Nonetheless, given that their use
only permits transient expression, they cannot be used for long
term studies or in vivo experiments [32]. Commercially available
mimics are usually expensive and often designed to favor the
expression of the miRNA strand by manipulating the sequence of
the miRNA* strand [29]. This makes them unsuitable for
investigations concerning the function of miRNA* species.
Vector-based miRNA expression systems can be used to ensure
stable expression of miRNAs. However, the biased nature of
strand incorporation into RISC makes it challenging to express
high levels of the miRNA* strand while simultaneously eliminating
the side effects caused by the miRNA strand [29].
To address this challenge and provide an easy and inexpensive
way to express specific miRNA* species, we reasoned the
possibility to overexpress specific miRNA species by using
manipulated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) overexpression system
and developed a new expression strategy. Further tests on our
prototypic plasmid, plvx-hs-146b-3p, which was designed to
overexpress hsa-miR-146b-3p for our further functional studies,
showed that our plasmid can express high levels of the miRNA*
species (hsa-miR-146b-3p) with no alteration of the level of
endogenous hsa-miR-146b-5p miRNA. And the expressed hsa￾miR-146b-3p could function to repress gene expression through
39UTR binding. Our strategy provides new opportunities to
analyze the functions of miRNA* species in vitro and in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
HeLa cells (provided by Youcun Qian, the Institute of Health
Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, and Shanghai Jiaotong University School of
Medicine, Shanghai, China; [33]), HEK 293T cells and Hep G2
cells (obtained from Cell Bank, Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China)
were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Gibco,
Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(SAFC, Sigma), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL strepto￾mycin (Gibco, Invitrogen) at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. MicroRNA mimics and inhibitors were
synthesized by Genepharma (China).
Generation of plasmids
Details concerning the design of miRNA overexpression
plasmids are provided in the first part of the Results section. To
generate the DNA incorporated into these plasmids, we simply
annealed the two specified synthetic DNA primers (Sangon
Biotech, China) in an annealing buffer (Beyotime, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the reaction
mixture contained 10 mL of annealing buffer, 20 mL of ddH2O,
10 mL of upstream primer (50 mM), and 10 mL of downstream
primer (50 mM). The annealing reaction involved heating the
mixtures to 95uC for 2 min, and then decreasing the temperature
by 1uC every 90 s until a temperature of 25uC was reached.
Finally, the inserts were inserted either into plvx-shRNA2 vectors
(Clontech) using BamH1 and EcoR1 restriction sites for overex￾pression plasmids, or into psicheck vectors (Promega) using Not1
and Xho1 restriction sites, or into pMIR-Report vectors (Ambion)
using Mlu1 and Sac1 restriction sites for sensor plasmids. pSIF-ctrl
and pSIF-hs-146b plasmids were kindly provided by Mofang Liu’s

Transfection
For luciferase assays, cells were seeded in a 96-well flat￾bottomed plate the day before transfection. Seeding was at a
concentration of 16104 cells per well in 100 mL medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. On the second day, at a
confluence of 70%–80%, the cells were transfected with the
indicated combination of sensor plasmids and miRNA overex￾pression vectors or miRNA mimics or inhibitors.
To evaluate miRNA overexpression, the day before transfec￾tion, cells were seeded in a 24- well flat-bottomed plate at a

confluence of 70%–80%, the cells were transfected with the
miRNA overexpression vectors indicated.
Transfection was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We used1 mL of
Lipofectamine 2000 for 1 mg of plasmid or 0.5 mL of Lipofecta￾mine 2000 with 10 pmol of miRNA mimics or inhibitors. The
final volume for 96-well plates was 100 mL and 600 mL for 24-well
plates. After 4 h incubation, the medium was changed to normal
culture medium.
Quantitative real-time RT–PCR
After 24 h of incubation following transfection, total cellular
RNA was collected and extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Invitro￾gen). MiRNA expression was detected using TaqMan MicroRNA
Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) according to the manu￾facturer’s protocol. We used RNU48 as the endogenous reference
gene. When indicated, miScript 2 RT kit (QIAGEN) was used to
do reverse transcription, and in this case miRNA was detected
using SYBR-green based method (SYBRH Premix Ex TaqTM II,
TaKaRa). The amplification was performed on ABI PRISM 7900
Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Luciferase assays
Protein was collected 24 h after transfection, using the Passive
Lysis Buffer (30 mL per well) provided as part of the Dual￾Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega). Firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities were examined according to the
procedure outlined by the manufacturer of the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). Signal was detected using a
Centro XS3 LB960 Luminometer (Berthold).
Results
Construction of plasmids for expression of microRNA*
species
Researchers have traditionally used plasmids to overexpress
miRNA by cloning genomic sequences of the miRNA hairpin
precursor into an overexpression vector. These include appropri￾ate stretches of flanking sequences (at least 40 nt on each side)
needed for correct processing of the primary transcripts by Drosha
[34]. However, because of the biased maturation process of
miRNAs, this method merely simulates the endogenous miRNA
processing pathway and is unsuitable for either high-level
expression of miRNA* species or the specific expression of the
miRNA* species without concomitant accumulation of its more
highly expressed miRNA counterpart [29].
Based on the widely used method for overexpressing miRNAs
by transfecting synthetic miRNA mimics, we assumed that if we
could introduce exogenous double stranded RNAs containing
mature sequences of miRNA* species into cells, we should be able
to overexpress the functional miRNA* species. Further, consider￾ing that a vector-based shRNA-directed RNA interference system
can synthesize customized double stranded short interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) in transfected cells [35,36,37], we designed an artificial
miRNA hairpin precursor (Figure 1a). This involves placing the
mature miRNA* sequence in the 39 strand of the stem, its
complementary sequence in the other strand, and a loop sequence
between the two. The corresponding DNA template is then cloned
into the shRNA overexpression vector.
Several core factors and mechanisms are common between the
processes required for the biogenesis and function of both siRNAs
and miRNAs [38]. Therefore, we reasoned that the hairpin
precursor that mimics shRNAs used for synthesizing siRNAs
should give rise to intermediate double-stranded RNAs containing
the mature miRNA* sequences that could be incorporated into the
RISC complex and function in the same way as miRNAs. Unlike
the original miRNA precursors that usually contain mismatches
and internal loops in the stems of their hairpin structures [39,40],
the 59 strand of the designed hairpin precursor was designed to
possess complete complementarity with the miRNA* sequences.
Although the 59 strand still contained considerable similarities to
the sequences of the miRNA originated from the same precursor
of the miRNA*, the change of the order of the sequence and the
additional nucleotides made the 59 strand a different miRNA like
RNAs harboring new seed sequences and having new supplemen￾tary pairing abilities. In addition, we could modify the 59 strand by
mutating several nucleotides both to further disturb the sequences
located in the seed region and avoid seed pairing by these
sequences, which might mimic the activity of the ‘‘miRNA’’
species. Owing to the well-established role of seed pairing in
miRNA target recognition [41], the modified 59 strand would not
contribute side effects associated with its activity as the ‘‘miRNA’’
strand, thereby enabling specific expression of miRNA* species
with no interference from its counterpart miRNA.
To validate our strategy and for our own further functional
studies, we focused on hsa-miR-146b-3p, the expression of which
is enhanced upon exposure to particular stimuli (data unpub￾lished). We used plvx-shRNA2 as the overexpression vector to
make our prototype overexpression plasmid referred as plvx-hs￾146b-3p, because this vector could be used to produce lenti-virus
particle for stable transfection and in vivo application. Hsa-miR￾146b-3p was the miRNA* species produced from the hsa-miR￾146b precursor, which also gave rise to the more abundant hsa￾miR-146b-5p miRNA species. We first designed the hairpin
precursor for hsa-miR-146b-3p by including all of its complete
complementary sequences (referred as anti-146b-3p) in the 59 arm
and its own sequences in the 39 arm of the hairpin, and separating
them by insertion of a widely used 9-nt loop sequence
(UUCAAGAGA) [36]. The same six nucleotides are found in
the seed region (site 3–8) of both hsa-miR-146b-5p and anti-146b￾3p. We thus changed A to G at site 5 and C to U at site 7 to
destroy this similarity in seed sequences of anti-146b-3p
(Figure 1b). Additional 59CCC and 39TTTTTA flanking sequenc￾es (both adopted from the pSUPER RNAi SystemTM manual,
OligoEngine, Inc.) were added after attaching cohesive ends
compatible with BamH1 and EcoR1 sites, which were used for
cloning inserts into the plvx-shRNA2 vector (Figure 1c). Finally,
we annealed the two synthesized template DNA oligos and
inserted the DNA fragment into the plvx-shRNA2 vector
(Figure 1c), using sequencing to confirm correct insertion.
Successful overexpression of hsa-miR-146b-3p from the
plvx-hs-146b-3p plasmid
To verify our overexpression strategy and ensure that plvx-hs￾146b-3p could indeed overexpress hsa-miR-146b-3p without
affecting the expression level of hsa-miR-146b-5p, we transfected
HeLa cells with plvx-hs-146b-3p plasmids. Once 24 h had passed
after transfection, RNA was collected and the expression of the
two miRNAs was measured by real-time PCR using the TaqManH
MicroRNA Assay. As shown in Figure 2a, there was a high level
expression of hsa-miR-146b-3p compared to levels following mock
transfection or transfection with an empty control vector (plvx￾ctrl). For the examination of hsa-miR-146b-5p in plvx-hs-146b-3p
transfected cells, we used another plasmid (referred as pSIF-hs￾146b), which had the ability to overexpress hsa-miR-146b-5p, as a
positive overexpression control for hsa-miR-146b-5p. As expected,
pSIF-hs-146b achieved a high level of hsa-miR-146b-5p expres￾sion compared with either mock transfection or transfection with

pSIF-ctrl, the empty control vector for pSIF-hs-146b. We could
not detect any overexpressed hsa-miR-146b-5p in the sample that
was transfected with plvx-hs-146b-3p (Figure 2b). In addition, we
verified these results using another two cell lines (Figure 2c–2f).
Meanwhile, we noticed that hsa-miR-146b-5p was reduced in
both Hela and HEK 293T cells transfected with plvx-hs-146b-3p.
We suspected that this was due to an inaccurate quantification of
hsa-miR-146b-5p, because there was no significant change of the
activity of hsa-miR-146b-5p detected by luciferase sensor exper￾iment (Figure 3a, Figure S3a, Figure S3b).
To test if the overexpressed hsa-miR-146b-3p or anti-146-3p
could affect the accuracy of the quantification of hsa-miR-146b￾5p, we used mixed RNA samples containing different amount of
synthetic single stranded hsa-miR-146b-3p (or anti-146b-3p) RNA
(100 ng, 10 ng, 1 ng, 0.1 ng, 0.01 ng, 0.001 ng, 0.0001 ng in each
sample) and equal amount of hsa-miR-146b-5p containing RNA
(20 ng in each sample) for the quantification of hsa-miR-146b-5p.
While the synthetic single stranded anti-146b-3p did not affect the
quantification of hsa-miR-146b-5p, synthetic single stranded hsa￾miR-146b-3p reduced the detected level of hsa-miR-146b-5p in a
Figure 1. Design and generation of plasmids for the overexpression of microRNA* species. (A) Design of the stem-loop miRNA precursor.
The mature sequences of miRNA* species were incorporated into the 39 arm of the precursor, whereas the complementary sequences of the miRNA*
species were incorporated into the 59 arm. Note that the complementary sequences could either be completely complementary to the miRNA*
species or could be modified by mutating several bases in its seed region, which were not complementary to the miRNA* species. (B) The designed
hsa-miR-146b-3p stem-loop precursor. The red characters in the 39 arm correspond with the sequences of hsa-miR-146b-3p. The 59 arm sequences

sequences and solid lines between them indicating the similarity of the two sequences. The dotted lines show the modified sites in the 59 arm
sequences and their corresponding nucleotides in hsa-miR-146b-3p sequences. (C) The uppermost oligo is the DNA insert of hsa-miR-146b-3p
precursor obtained by annealing two single stranded DNA oligos with BamH1 and EcoR1 sticky ends. The DNA insert was incorporated into plvx￾shRNA2 between the recognition sites for the restriction enzymes BamH1 and EcoR1. The representation of the vector was modified from an
illustration in the instructions provided with the product.

dose dependent manner (Figure S1a). The more hsa-miR-146b-3p
was added, the less hsa-miR-146b-5p was detected (the higher Ct
value was observed). We then did the reverse transcription of
synthetic single stranded hsa-miR-146b-3p (100 ng, 10 ng, 1ng,
0.1 ng, 0.01 ng in each reaction) and hsa-miR-146b-5p containing
RNA (20 ng in each reaction) separately, and combined the
products of each hsa-miR-146b-3p sample (100 ng, 10 ng, 1ng,
0.1 ng, 0.01 ng in each reaction) with that of each hsa-miR-146b￾5p containing RNA sample (20 ng in each reaction) and used the
mixed samples for subsequent hsa-miR-146b-5p detection. This
time, we did not observed any dose dependent effects on the Ct
values of hsa-miR-146b-5p (Figure S1b). Thus, we confirmed that
the inaccurate quantification was resulted from the deficient
reverse transcription of hsa-miR-146b-5p. Finally, we used
miScript 2 RT kit (from QIAGEN), which applied a different
principle for reverse transcription of miRNAs, to do reverse
transcription and quantified hsa-miR-146b-5p by SYBR-green
based method using the same sample in Figure 2f (which was
mock, plvx-ctrl, and plvx-hs-146b-3p). As shown in Figure S1c,
although it was slightly lower than the control samples (mock and
plvx-ctrl), the significant reduced expression of hsa-miR-146b-5p
was not observed. So, we proposed that the reduction of hsa-miR￾146b-5p was due to the effect of abundant exogenous hsa-miR￾146b-3p on the efficiency of hsa-miR-146b-5p’s reverse transcrip￾tion when using Taqman assay and it was possibly caused by the
paring of the complimentary sequences between hsa-miR-146b-3p
and hsa-miR-146b-5p (Figure S1d), which might affect efficient
primer binding.
Considering that different cell lines have different endogenous
levels of hsa-miR-146b-5p and transfection efficiency of different
cell lines was varied, the ratio of hsa-miR-146b-3p to hsa-miR￾146b-5p in the RNA samples from different cell lines was not the
same and the extent of this effect was varied too. Therefore, the
observed reduction of hsa-miR-146b-5p showed a cell type specific
phenomenon (Hela and HEK 293T cells were more easily
transfected and contained much lower level of hsa-miR-146b-5p
than Hep G2 cells).
Collectively, these data demonstrated that our plvx-hs-146b-3p
plasmid can overexpress hsa-miR-146b-3p without altering the
expression of hsa-miR-146b-5p. Moreover, because the stem–loop
structure of the reverse transcription primers used in the
TaqManH MicroRNA Assay provided specificity for only the
mature miRNA with its entire 39 end [42], we could confidently
conclude that the over-expressed hsa-miR-146b-3p in our
experiments was identical to the mature form in miRBase, which
represented the most abundant sequence of the miRNA [39].
The overexpressed hsa-miR-146b-3p by plvx-hs-146b-3p
functioned as a miRNA without detectable change of the
activity of hsa-miR-146b-5p
To analyze whether the miRNA overexpressed by our plvx-hs￾146b-3p plasmid was functional and further exclude the possible
existence of the side effects associated with the change of the
expression of hsa-miR-146b-5p, we first constructed sensor
plasmids for both hsa-miR-146b-3p (referred to as psicheck-hs￾146b-3p) and hsa-miR-146b-5p (referred to as psicheck-hs-146b￾5p). These contain two perfect binding sites in the 39UTR region
of Renilla luciferase reporter gene, which would provide good
sensitivity to monitor miRNA activities previously described [29].
We confirmed that these sensor plasmids could indeed sense the
activities of their corresponding miRNAs by co-transfecting them
with synthetic miRNA mimics for hsa-miR-146b-3p and hsa-miR￾146b-5p, respectively (Figure S2a and Figure S2b). More impor￾tantly, psicheck-hs-146b-5p could not be affected by hsa-miR￾146b-3p mimics (Figure S2b) and another unrelated miRNA hsa￾miR-218 could not inhibit Renilla luciferase activity expressed
from psicheck-hs-146b-3p (Figure S2a). This indicated that the
decreased luciferase signal was specific for the activity of the
corresponding miRNA.
We then transfected HeLa cells with either psicheck-hs-146b-3p
or psicheck-hs-146b-5p in combination with plvx-hs-146b-3p or
plvx-ctrl, respectively. Consistent with previous miRNA expression
data, plvx-hs-146b-3p could only repress the Renilla luciferase
activity of psicheck-hs-146b-3p with no inhibition of activity
arising from psicheck-hs-146b-5p (Figure 3a). We further elimi￾nated the possibility that plvx-hs-146b-3p could repress activity of
the Renilla luciferase reporter gene independent of the 39UTR by
transfecting plvx-hs-146b-3p together with an empty psicheck
vector, named psicheck-ctrl (Figure 3a). To exclude a cell type
specific effect, we did the same experiments in HEK 293T and
Hep G2 cells and got the same results (Figure S3).
To confirm that the repression was indeed mediated by
overexpressed hsa-miR-146b-3p and not through a nonspecific
effect caused by transfection with an exogenous plasmid, we
transfected inhibitors of hsa-miR-146b-3p together with plvx-hs￾146b-3p to block the activity of hsa-miR-146b-3p. As expected,
the repression was almost fully rescued by the inhibition of hsa￾miR-146b-3p (Figure 3b).
Considering that the sequences located on either side of the
stem of an shRNA had the capability to mature and might be
functional [43,44], we needed to exclude the possibility that the
repression of plvx-hs-146b-3p sensor’s activity may be caused by
non-specific effects of the other strand. To overexpress the two
sequences from the stem of the designed shRNA, we synthesized
single-strand RNAs with the same sequences of both hsa-miR￾146b-3p and its designed counterpart. We then transfected them
into HeLa cells separately, both with psicheck-hs-146b-3p. As
expected, only single-stand hsa-miR-146b-3p could repress the
activity of Renilla luciferase from psicheck-hs-146b-3p (Figure 3c).
MicroRNAs usually function by incomplete complementary
pairing to their target region, in which process perfect seed pairing
is essential [41]. Therefore, to further validate that the miRNA
produced by our plasmid could function as typical miRNAs other
than only as siRNAs, we constructed another sensor plasmid
(pMIR-hs-146b-3p) with two tandem target sites containing
central bulges to mimic the traditional miRNA targets as previous
reported [29]. We then mutated the seed region of the bulged
target site to generate the plasmid pMIR-hs-146b-3p-mut. Having
confirmed that pMIR-hs-146b-3p could indeed sense the activity
of hsa-miR-146b-3p and the mutation in pMIR-hs-146b-3p-mut
could abolish this effect by using miRNA mimics of hsa-miR￾146b-3p (Figure S4), we then tested the repression abilities of our
plvx-hs-146b-3p plasmids by these two sensor plasmids. As shown
in Figure 3d, plvx-hs-146b-3p repressed bulged sensor activity and
this effect was abolished by mutation of its seed region. This
indicated a miRNA-like function of the overexpressed miRNA.
3p (A) and hsa-miR-146b-5p (B) was detected using qRT–PCR. The same experiments were done in Hep G2 cells (C) for hsa-miR-146b-3p; (D) for hsa￾miR-146b-5p and HEK 293T cells (E) for hsa-miR-146b-3p; (F) for hsa-miR-146b-5p. Each graph shows the mean of three independent experiments

Novel Method for Exclusive MiRNA* Overexpression
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e41504

Taken together, we demonstrated that our prototype plasmid
plvx-hs-146b-3p could specifically overexpress hsa-miR-146b-3p,
which could function as effectively as natural miRNAs without any
activity change of hsa-miR-146b-5p.
Overexpression of other miRNAs by our strategy
In order to see if our strategy could overexpress other miRNAs,
we synthesized customized sequences for hsa-miR-127-3p and hsa￾miR-142-3p, which were selected to work with because we already
had their cognate detection probes. The corresponding overex￾pression plasmids we constructed were named plvx-hs-127-3p and
plvx-hs-142-3p, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, both miRNAs
were successfully overexpressed from their corresponding plasmids
in HeLa cells. This indicates that our strategy can be used to
overexpress different miRNAs, including highly expressed miRNA
species such as hsa-miR-127-3p.
Discussion
MicroRNAs, which make a critical contribution to the
regulation of gene expression circuits, participate in many
physiological and pathological processes by fine-tuning signaling
events at the molecular and cellular levels [1,8]. Intensive effort
has been devoted to exploring their functions. Any single miRNA
precursor potentially produces two mature miRNAs [12]. How￾ever, the function of the less expressed form, the miRNA* species,
has not been studied as intensively as that of its more highly
expressed miRNA counterpart. Recently, many expression data
sets and large-scale small RNA sequencing efforts revealed a
Figure 3. plvx-hs-146b-3p overexpressed functional hsa-miR-146b-3p with no detectable activity change of hsa-miR-146b-5p. (A)
Transcription products from plvx-hs-146b-3p had hsa-miR-146b-3p activities, without changing the activity of hsa-miR-146b-5p. HeLa cells were
transfected with psicheck-ctrl (20 ng per well), psicheck-146b-3psensor (20 ng per well), or psicheck-146b-5psensor (20 ng per well), in combination
with either plvx-ctrl (100 ng per well) or plvx-hs-146b-3p (100 ng per well), as indicated in the graph. (B) The repression of psicheck-146b-3psensor
activity could be rescued using hsa-miR-146b-3p inhibitors. HeLa cells were transfected with psicheck-146b-3psensor (20 ng per well) in combination
of plvx-ctrl (100 ng per well) or plvx-hs-146b-3p (100 ng per well) under the presentation of hsa-miR-146b-3p inhibitors (100 nM) or inhibitor
negative controls (100 nM), as indicated in the graph. (C) Designed modified complementary sequences (designed anti-hsa-miR-146b-3p) could not
repress psicheck-146b-3psensor activity as effectively as hsa-miR-146b-3p. HeLa cells were transfected with psicheck-146b-3psensor (20 ng per well)
in combination with single stranded RNA mimics of negative control sequences (100 nM), designed anti-hsa-miR-146b-3p (100 nM), hsa-miR-146b-3p
(100 nM), and hsa-miR-410 (100 nM), as indicated in the graph. The miRNA hsa-miR-410, which had no ability to repress psicheck-146b-3psensor
activity, was used as a negative control miRNA. (D) The miRNA hsa-miR-146b-3p overexpressed by plvx-hs-146b-3p could repress the activity of
bulged sensor of hsa-miR-146b-3p (pMIR-hs-146b-3p) and this repression was abolished by mutation of the seed sequences of the bulged sensor.
HeLa cells were transfected with pMIR-hs-146b-3p (2 ng per well) or pMIR-hs-146b-3p-mut (2 ng per well), together with plvx-ctrl (400 ng per well) or
plvx-hs-146b-3p (400 ng per well), as indicated in the graph. Renilla luciferase vector (5 ng per well) was delivered simultaneously as a transfection
control. For all assays, protein was collected 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was quantified and expressed as relative luciferase activity. The
data represent one of at least three independent experiments, each of which involved four replicates. Error bars represent SEMs. ** means p value

tissue- or cell-type-dependent accumulation of miRNA* species
[45]. Our own unpublished data also showed that different
physiological and environmental stimuli can change the profile of
mature miRNAs in certain cell types, including miRNA* species.
Additionally, recent work demonstrated that miRNA* species can
have important effects on vertebrate regulatory networks, suggest￾ing the importance of studies that explore their functions and
could potentially contribute to better understanding of disease
states [29,30,31].
Synthetic miRNA mimics are often used to introduce specific
miRNAs into target cells. However, transient overexpression
cannot provide sufficiently high long-term expression and in vivo
delivery is still difficult. Vector-based overexpression methods,
especially those involving viral vectors, provide an opportunity to
overcome this problem. But, because of the nature of the
biogenesis of miRNAs, cells tend to express miRNAs other than
the sparsely expressed star forms. This constitutes the main
theoretical and practical obstacle for using traditional cloning
methods to construct miRNA overexpression vectors for express￾ing miRNA* species.
By mimicking the design of shRNAs, we developed a strategy to
overexpress miRNA* species without detectable increase of their
highly expressed counterparts. This enabled us to investigate the
function of miRNA* species without side effects introduced by
expression of their miRNA counterparts. As mentioned above,
there were many unpaired bases in the predicted secondary
structures of the miRNA precursors [39,40], and the two miRNAs
from the same precursor usually have 39 overhang bases in their
own sequences. Therefore, the complete complementary sequenc￾es of the miRNA* species could not be the same as the original
miRNA from the other strand. This suggested to us the potential
value of manipulating the complementary sequences of the
miRNA* species in order to eliminate any activity of its
counterpart miRNA. Because both strands from the shRNA had
the possibility to function [43,44], two principles warrant
particular mention. The first is the importance of changing
several sequences within the seed region in the complementary
sequences that still had the same bases as the original miRNA to
ensure that its activity is eliminated. The second is the importance
of checking the potential siRNA effects of the complementary
sequences, and excluding related side effects by mutating some of
the nucleotides. Additionally, different mutation strategies could
be used to make anti-miRNA* strands and construct different
plasmids. By checking if the phenomenon is the same when using
two different plasmids, one can make the decision about if their
phenomenon is really associated with miRNA* or not.
Another consideration concerns whether levels of expression
level are sufficiently high. Because of the differences between
individual miRNAs, not all designed stem-loop structures enable
very high levels of expression. We thought that this might arise as a
consequence of the different efficiency with which mature
sequences are incorporated into the RISC complex. Previous
studies showed that the strand with its 59 end less tightly paired to
the complementary sequences has lower internal stability, which
makes it bind the RISC complex more efficiently than the other
strand [13,14]. Thus, we suggested that additional mutation could
be used to modify the 39 end of the complementary sequences to
increase levels of expression. In summary, we could express
specific miRNA* species by an designed shRNA with miRNA*
sequences in the anti-sense strand and manipulated complemen￾tary sequences in the sense strand. Using this strategy, combined
with different vector systems, researchers should be able to easily
design and make their own overexpression plasmids without the
understanding aspects of the structure and processing principles of
miRNA precursors that remain to be fully elucidated.
Vector-based miRNA expression remains a convenient tool for
long-term overexpression experiments, especially given its capa￾bility to stable express specific miRNAs in live cells. Moreover, the
use of viral vectors solved the problem of difficult transfection and
different viral vectors were widely used in in vivo studies. Therefore,
by combining different vector systems, our strategy should enable
researchers to explore the function of any miRNA* or even
miRNA species in vitro or in vivo without interference from related
molecules normally generated from the same pre-miRNA.
Moreover, considering the involvement of miRNAs in many
diseases, including cancer [46] and autoimmune diseases [47], the
capacity to specifically alter the abundance of certain miRNAs
potentially provides a new strategy for treating human diseases
[48]. And our strategy provides such a tool for overexpressing one
mature miRNA in patients without unwanted side effects arising

from the simultaneous expression of the other miRNA encoded by
the same precursor.
Collectively, our work presents a new way to overexpress
functional miRNA* species, which has been challenging to achieve
using traditional methods. Further experiments demonstrated that
the strategy can be applied to different miRNA* species or even
miRNA species. By taking advantage of different vector expression
systems, our approach should find useful applications both for
experimental research or therapeutic applications.
