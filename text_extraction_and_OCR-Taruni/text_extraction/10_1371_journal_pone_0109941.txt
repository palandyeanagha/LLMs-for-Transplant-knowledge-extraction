Abstract
Background: Little is known about the nature of the host immune response to Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC)
infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether alterations in serum immunomolecule levels after
treating MABC lung disease patients with antibiotics can reflect the disease-associated characteristics.
Methods: A total of 22 immunomolecules in 24 MABC lung disease patients before and after antibiotic therapy were
quantitatively analyzed using a multiplex bead-based system.
Results: In general, the pre-treatment levels of T helper type 1 (Th1)-related cytokines, i.e., interferon (IFN)-c and interleukin
(IL)-12, and Th2-related cytokines, i.e., IL-4 and IL-13, were significantly decreased in patients compared with control
subjects. In contrast, the pre-treatment levels of Th17-related cytokines, i.e., IL-17 and IL-23, were significantly increased in
MABC patients. Interestingly, significantly higher levels of IFN-c-induced protein (IP)-10 and monokine induced by IFN￾cprotein (MIG) were detected in patients with failure of sputum conversion at post-treatment compared to patients with
successful sputum conversion.
Conclusion: Reduced Th1 and Th2 responses and enhanced Th17 responses in patients may perpetuate MABC lung disease,
and the immunomolecules IP-10 and MIG, induced through IFN-c, may serve as key markers for indicating the treatment
outcome.

Introduction
The prevalence of lung diseases caused by nontuberculous
mycobacteria (NTM) is increasing worldwide, and NTM infec￾tions have been associated with environmental exposure to factors
such as soil and water [1,2]. Mycobacterium abscessus complex
(MABC) represents a group of rapidly growing mycobacteria and
an emerging cause of NTM lung disease in patients with cystic
fibrosis and chronic lung diseases [3–5]. MABC comprises 3
subspecies; M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (hereafter referred to as
M. abscessus), M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (hereafter M.
massiliense), and M. abscessus subsp. bolletii [6]. Within MABC,
M. abscessus is the most common pathogen, followed by M.
massiliense, although the proportion of each subspecies varies
according to geographical location [7,8].
The outcome of natural infections with pathogenic mycobac￾teria ranges from early asymptomatic clearance to chronic clinical
disease. MABC is the most drug-resistant of the mycobacterial
pathogens, resulting in limited therapeutic options and a high
treatment failure rate [8]. Although defects in immunological
defense mechanisms have been suggested as predisposing factors to
disease in a murine model of M. abscessus infection, including
genetic defects in the interferon (IFN)-c-interleukin (IL)-12 axis in
MABC lung disease [9], understanding the nature of the immune
response in humans to MABC at the molecular level is more
important for the development of effective strategies to treat these
mycobacterial species.
Although T helper type 1 (Th1) immunity typically plays a
major role in controlling mycobacterial infections, host defense
mechanisms against MABC remain poorly understood. M.

abscessus induces the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a,
IL-6, and IL-12p40 in murine macrophages via Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-2 [10]. In addition, M. massiliense induces TNF-a and IL-6
production in murine macrophages [11]. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from NTM patients were shown to
produce less Th1 cytokines (IFN-c, IL-12, and TNF-a) compared
to healthy controls, suggesting that NTM lung disease might
reflect defects in the IL-12/IFN-c pathway [12,13]. Th2 immunity
has been associated with poorer prognoses in TB but has not been
described in NTM lung disease [14]. In addition, IL-17 levels are
lower in patients with M. avium complex (MAC) lung disease
compared to control subjects, suggesting that reduced Th17
immunity might be associated with MAC lung disease [15]. Thus,
different host factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, have been
implicated in determining the outcome of these infections and
related treatment responses.
Recently, we reported that a lower level of Th1 and Th17
responses was associated with disease susceptibility in patients with
MAC lung disease [16]. However, it remains unclear whether
altered levels of these cytokines represent a general phenomenon
in NTM infections or mycobacteria species-specific patterns. In
the present study, we investigated the changes in host immune
responses, including Th1, Th2, and Th17 immunity, after treating
MABC lung disease patients with antibiotics.
Methods
Ethics statement
The data in the present study are part of an ongoing prospective
observational cohort study investigating NTM lung disease
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00970801). The study protocol
was approved through the institutional review board of the
Samsung Medical Center (IRB approval 2008-09-016), and
written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Study subjects
A total of 24 patients diagnosed with the nodular bronchiectatic
or fibrocavitary forms of MABC lung disease at the Samsung
Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) were enrolled. A diagnosis of
NTM lung disease was obtained for patients who fulfilled the
clinical, radiographic, and microbiological diagnostic criteria of
the American Thoracic Society [2]. The median age of the
patients was 57.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50.3–64.8
years). Among the 24 patients identified as having MABC
infection, 13 (54.2%) patients were identified as having M.
abscessus infection, and the remaining 11 patients were identified
as having M. massiliense infection. None of the patients had
immunodeficiencies, malignancies, or were positive for antibodies
to human immunodeficiency virus. The baseline characteristics of
the patients are summarized in Table 1. Twenty-five healthy
control subjects (10 men and 15 women) were recruited. None of
the control subjects showed any evidence of pulmonary disease at
the time of participation, and these individuals were non-smokers
and free of allergic diseases, diabetes mellitus, liver diseases, and
viral infections.
Serum samples
Serum samples were collected from healthy individuals at a
single time point and from all patients before treatment and 12
months (IQR 11–12 months) after the start of antibiotic treatment.
The samples were stored at 280uC until further testing.
Multiplex bead-based cytokine assay
The serum samples were simultaneously screened for 22
cytokines using the Cytokine Assay kit (Panomics, Inc., Fremont,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The plate
was analyzed using a Luminex 100 instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Each unique target molecule was assessed in duplicate.
Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the median and IQR for continuous
variables and as numbers (percentages) for categorical variables.
The data were subjected to repeated measures analysis using
PROC MIXED in SAS statistical software, version 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). To compare patients and control
subjects, Wilcoxon’s two-sample test or an independent two￾sample t-test was used. To compare pre- and post-treatment
conditions, a paired t-test or Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used.
To compare time points and changes between pre- and post￾treatment conditions among subgroups, Wilcoxon’s two-sample
test or an independent two-sample t-test was used. The P-value for
differences in cytokine concentrations was corrected using
Bonferroni’s method to avoid inflated type I errors among 3
variables (pre-treatment, post-treatment, and changes between
pre- and post-treatment conditions). A P-value of,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Th1 immunity-related immunomolecules in MABC lung
disease
To investigate host susceptibility factors, serum immunomole￾cules were first compared between healthy controls and patients
with MABC lung disease prior to antibiotic treatment (see Table
S1). The pre-treatment levels of IFN-c and IL-12 were signifi￾cantly lower in patients with MABC lung disease than control
subjects, whereas the pre-treatment levels of TNF-a were
upregulated in patients (Fig. 1). The levels of monokine induced
by IFN-c protein (MIG)/CXCL9, IFN-c-induced protein (IP)-10/
CXCL10, and regulated upon-activation normal T cell-expressed
and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5 in patients with MABC lung
disease were significantly higher than in control subjects, while the
levels of sCD40L and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) were lower in patients than control subjects. The
pre-treatment levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-
1a and MIP-1b in patients were not significantly different from
those in control subjects (Fig. 1).
Th2 immunity-related immunomolecules in MABC lung
disease
The pre-treatment levels of IL-4 and IL-13, secreted from Th2
cells, were significantly lower in patients with MABC lung disease
than in control subjects (Fig. 2). The pre-treatment levels of
Eotaxin and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3 were not
significantly different from those in control subjects (Fig. 2).
Th17 immunity-related immunomolecules in MABC lung
disease
The pre-treatment levels of IL-17 and IL-23 in patients with
MABC lung disease were significantly higher than in control
subjects (Fig. 3). The levels of MIP-3a/CCL20 in patients with
MABC lung disease were significantly higher than those in control
subjects, but no significant difference in the levels of IL-8 were
observed between the two groups (Fig. 3).

Changes in the cytokine levels between pre- and post￾treatment conditions
All patients received combination antibiotic treatment for at
least 12 months. We analyzed the changes in the cytokine levels
during treatment, and Table 2 shows significant changes in the
cytokine levels according to treatment.
The levels of Th1-related cytokines and chemokines were
significantly decreased after therapy. However, the levels of Th2-
related molecules (IL-4, IL-13, Eotaxin, and MCP-1) were not
changed after therapy. Th17-related molecules were either
significantly decreased (IL-8 and IL-17) or remained unchanged
(IL-23 and MIP-3a) according to treatment. Notably, adiponectin
levels were increased only after treatment.
Comparison of serum immunomolecule levels in patient
subgroups
Sputum culture conversion was achieved in 15 patients (62.5%).
M. abscessus (n = 6) was the causative species in patients whose
AFB cultures were not negatively converted. We also analyzed the
changes in cytokine levels between pre- and post-treatment
according to disease type (nodular bronchiectatic or fibrocavitary
forms), negative conversion of sputum culture, and causative
species (M. abscessus or M. massiliense). The cytokine levels
between pre- and post-treatment were not different according to
disease type and causative species (data not shown). However, the
levels of IP-10 and MIG were lower in patients with successful
sputum conversion than in patients with failed sputum conversion
at post-treatment (Fig. 4).
Discussion
NTM is becoming more prevalent as a cause of pulmonary
disease in hosts without overt immunodeficiency. Although it
remains unclear why otherwise healthy subjects should develop
pulmonary diseases in response to these opportunistic pathogens,
altered immunological factors have been associated with the
development of disease. Therefore, we evaluated the levels of 22
immunomolecules that play critical roles in mycobacterial
infection and observed significant differences in immunological
responses between control subjects and patients during therapy.
Th1 immunity is important for protection against mycobacterial
infections. The levels of Th1 immunity-related molecules, IFN-c,
IL-12, and sCD40L, were lower in patients at diagnosis time
points. These findings support the idea that decreased IFN-c, IL￾12, and sCD40L levels are associated with MAC and M. abscessus
lung disease [13,16]. In contrast, the relative level of IL-10 was
increased in the peripheral blood of patients compared with
controls (P= 0.013). IL-10 is a regulatory cytokine involved in
limiting the inflammatory response during NTM infection; in
particular, IL-10 inhibits the secretion of IFN-c and IL-12 in
patients with MAC lung disease [17]. IL-27 is also associated with
the Th1 response and is a critical factor in the induction of IL-10.
The relative level of IL-27 was decreased in the peripheral blood
of patients after treatment. Thus, the roles for IL-10 and IL-27 in

the balance between pathology and protection are important.
TNF-a is also an essential cytokine for the development of
protective immunity. In the present study, the production of TNF￾a was significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients
and decreased during therapy. Indeed, the levels of TNF-a have
been shown to be higher in patients with tuberculosis (TB) [18].
Notably, TNF-a is produced in both Th1 and Th17 cells in
response to M. abscessus infection, and the pattern of TNF-a was
similar to that of IL-17, which is produced by Th17 cells. In the
present study, IL-17 production was significantly increased in
patients with MABC lung disease and decreased during therapy.
Therefore, increased TNF-a in patients with MABC lung disease
is more likely produced by Th17 cells than Th1 cells. In addition,
a high level of TNF-a in MABC patients might reflect a
compensatory host defense mechanism to control mycobacterial
infection. CXCR3 (receptor for IP-10 and MIG) and CCR5
(receptor for MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and RANTES) are predominantly
expressed by Th1 cells [19]. The IP-10, MIG, and RANTES levels
were higher in the peripheral blood of patients than in control
subjects. Increased levels of IP-10 and MIG in M. tuberculosis￾infected human cells and an increased level of RANTES in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from TB patients have previously
been reported [20,21]. Thus, these inflammatory chemokines may
be increased in response to MABC infection.
Th2 cells express CCR3 (receptor for Eotaxin and MCP-3), and
Eotaxin therefore plays a key role in Th2 cell recruitment. The
levels of Th2-related cytokines and chemokines were decreased in
the peripheral blood of patients and were not changed during
therapy. In MAC patients, the levels of IL-4 and IL-13 were not
significantly different from those in control subjects and were not
changed during therapy [16]. Thus, defective Th2 immunity
might be associated with host susceptibility to MABC infection.
We also examined Th17 immunity in the present study. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate changes in cytokine
levels associated with Th17 immunity in response to MABC
infection in humans. Th17-related cytokines have been informa￾Figure 1. The levels of Th1 immunity-related cytokines between controls and patients at pre-treatment.

tive for studying protective and damaging immune responses. For
instance, it has been reported that IL-23 restores immunity to M.
tuberculosis infection and preferentially promotes the production
of IL-17 [22]. The potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17
induces the expression of chemokines that promote neutrophil
recruitment and granuloma organization throughout infection. A
recent study showed increased IL-17 and IL-23 gene expression in
the lungs of patients with active TB [23] and the study by Lim et

al. reported that MAC lung disease was associated with defects or
biases in Th1 and Th17 immunity [15]. An increase of Th2 and
Th17 cells was observed in peripheral blood of patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in comparison to controls,
while Th1 cells was not significantly different [24]. In addition,
increased Th17 response was observed in peripheral blood of
patients with cystic fibrosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and allergic
asthma [25–27]. Thus, the elevated Th17 response in combination
with Th1 or Th2 immunity plays an important role in disease
development and progression of non-infection-mediated lung
disease as well as mycobacterial lung disease.
In the present study, the pre-treatment levels of IL-17 and IL-23
were higher in the peripheral blood of patients than in control
subjects, and IL-17 production was decreased after treatment.
Thus, the increased production of these cytokines in response to
MABC infection might not be sufficient to suppress the
development of disease. IL-23 was also shown to increase IFN-c
and IL-17 expression in the lungs of IL-12(p40)-deficient mice.
Therefore, the induction of IL-17 by Th17 cells might be
inadequate for protection, and increased IL-17 levels in MABC
patients might instead play a pathological role.
Leptin-deficient mice show reduced lung IFN-c levels and
greater susceptibility to M. tuberculosis compared with wild-type
mice [28], and the levels of leptin were shown to be lower in TB
patients than control subjects [29]. In the present study, the leptin
levels in the peripheral blood were not different between patients
with MABC lung disease and control subjects, and no change was
detected during therapy (Table 2). In TB patients, the adiponectin
levels did not change after treatment [30], whereas our results
showed that the adiponectin levels in the peripheral blood of
patients were increased after treatment.
In addition, the levels of each cytokine between pre- and post￾treatment were not different in all subgroups according to patterns
of disease and causative species. However, the levels of IP-10 and
MIG were significantly lower in the peripheral blood of patients
with successful sputum conversion than in patients with failed
sputum conversion at post-treatment. Furthermore, the levels of
these chemokines in patients with successful sputum conversion
were similar to those observed at baseline after treatment. In
previous studies, IP-10 and MIG levels were significantly higher in
TB patients compared to control subjects, suggesting that these
chemokines are potential biomarkers of TB infection [31–33]. In
particular, IP-10 is expressed at very high levels along with less
biodegradable potency in a whole blood sample compared with
IFN-c, the current diagnostic marker in TB patients [34–36].
Thus, IP-10 may serve as a biomarker for mycobacterial lung
disease.
IFN-c induces IP-10 and MIG production; however, other
cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-17, have been implicated in the
induction of IP-10 and MIG production [37,38]. In the present
study, the pattern of IP-10 and MIG production was similar to that
of TNF-a and IL-17, and the levels of these cytokines were
significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients and
decreased during therapy. This finding might explain why MABC
patients show high levels of IP-10 and MIG but lower levels of
IFN-c. Indeed, elevated plasma IP-10 levels have been associated
with poor responses to treatment in TB and NTM patients
[32,34,39,40]. Thus, measuring the IP-10 and MIG levels might
facilitate the assessment of treatment efficacy.
The present study has some limitations. First, this study was
conducted at a single center and performed on a referral basis,
with the analysis of only a small number of Korean patients.
Second, this study was preliminary because we did not investigate
the precise mechanism of the specific molecules associated with
clinical outcomes. Finally, it is unable to be determined in our
study whether our results were the cause of the development of
MABC infection or whether MAC infection caused the alterations
of the cytokine levels. Alterations in serum immunomolecule levels
may be the reflection of MABC infection. The further studies are
required to evaluate whether the altered level of cytokines are the
cause or result of MABC infection. Nevertheless, the cytokines
detected in the study during antibiotic therapy may help in the
rational design of more effective therapeutic strategies against
MABC lung disease.
In conclusion, reduced Th1 and Th2 responses and enhanced
Th17 responses in patients might perpetuate MABC lung disease.
The balance of the type of T cell immunity is critical for
determining susceptibility to MABC and the outcome of disease.
Improved knowledge of the function of each cytokine during the
initiation of immune responses and after treatment will facilitate
the development of better immunological and therapeutic
interventions to promote balanced immune responses and predict
treatment outcomes.
