Abstract: Nanomaterials have been actively pursued for biological and medical applications in 
recent years. Here, we report the synthesis of several new poly(ethylene glycol) grafted branched￾polymers for functionalization of various nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes, gold 
nanoparticles (NP) and gold nanorods (NRs), affording high aqueous solubility and stability for 
these materials. We synthesize different surfactant polymers based upon poly-(γ-glutamic acid) 
(γPGA) and poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMHC18). We use the abundant free 
carboxylic acid groups of γPGA for attaching lipophilic species such as pyrene or phospholipid, 
which bind to nanomaterials via robust physisorption. Additionally, the remaining carboxylic acids 
on γPGA or the amine-reactive anhydrides of PMHC18 are then PEGylated, providing extended 
hydrophilic groups, affording polymeric amphiphiles. We show that single-walled carbon nanotubes 

2 
(SWNTs), Au NPs and NRs functionalized by the polymers exhibit high stability in aqueous 
solutions at different pH’s, at elevated temperatures and in serum. Morever, the polymer-coated 
SWNTs exhibit remarkably long blood circulation (t1/2 22.1 h) upon intravenous injection into mice, 
far exceeding the previous record of 5.4 h. The ultra-long blood circulation time suggests greatly 
delayed clearance of nanomaterials by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of mice, a highly 
desired property for in vivo applications of nanomaterials, including imaging and drug delivery. 
Introduction 
Nanostructures including SWNTs, Au NPs and Au NRs are currently being explored for 
biomedical applications, including in vivo delivery (e.g. drugs,1, 2 proteins, peptides3-5 and nucleic 
acids2, 4-9), biological detection of proteins10-12 and in vivo imaging13. Most inorganic nanomaterials 
are not soluble in physiological buffers, and require functionalization by thiols or surfactants to 
obtain biocompatibility. Many surfactant coatings become unstable in serum, or upon removing the 
excess of the coating molecule. PEGylation is a common strategy to impart functionality, water 
solubility and biocompatibility14-17. Even so, in vivo, most of the existing functionalization methods 
of nanomaterials suffer from rapid uptake by the reticuloendotheial system (RES) and short blood 
circulation times. Sufficient blood circulation time is critical to both imaging and in vivo delivery. 
In recent years, advances have been made toward the use of polymeric amphiphiles to coat 
nanomaterials non-covalently. For SWNTs, non-covalent functionalization is necessary to preserve 
the intrinsic physical properties of SWNTs, including near-infrared fluorescence and Raman 
scattering, useful for biomedical imaging18. To this end SWNTs have been incorporated into 
micelles formed by various surfactants in aqueous solutions, such as lipids19, 20, sugars
21, proteins,22, 
23 DNA,24, 25 and polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG)26, 27.
 Also, it has been found that densely 
coating nanomaterial surfaces with PEG28, 29 increases in vivo circulation times, likely by resisting 
clearance via the RES. Still, much room exists to optimize non-covalent nanomaterial surface 

3 
coating, improving the circulation behavior of SWNTs for in vivo biomedical applications 
including tumor targeting, imaging and therapy. 
Similarly to SWNTs, inorganic colloidal nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles (NP) or 
gold nanorods, have been extensively investigated for two decades, and have found application 
largely in detection schemes for DNA,7-9 proteins,10, 11 and other biomolecular analytes. NPs and 
NRs have also been used in single-particle coding and tracking experiments in vitro,30-35 and in 
vivo.36 These applications require robust, aqueous nanoparticle suspensions, which have relied upon 
surface passivation by small molecules,37-42 lipids,43-45 surface silanization46-49 and amphiphilic 
polymer coatings. There is significant ongoing research regarding the synthesis of stabilized Au 
NPs in the presence or in the absence of thiol ligands.50-52Pyrene-containing and phospholipid￾coating moieties have been used extensively for binding to carbon nanotubes13, 28, 53, 54 and gold 
nanoparticles55, due to strong interactions including van der Waals forces, π-π stacking, charge 
transfer, and/or hydrophobic interactions 28, 56, 57. 
Here, we report the synthesis of several new poly(ethylene glycol) grafted branched￾polymers based upon poly-(γ-glutamic acid) (γPGA) and poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) 
(PMHC18). Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γPGA) is a naturally occurring bio-material, produced by 
microbial fermentation58. γPGA is water soluble, biodegradable, nontoxic and edible. We propose 
that a portion of the free carboxylic acids of γPGA could first be coupled to lipophilic groups for 
binding to nanomaterials via hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, while the remaining 
carboxylic acids can be conjugated to PEG, providing enhanced aqueous solubility and further 
biocompatibility59. In the case of 1, the copolymer itself contains an alternating hydrophobic unit, 
the C18 chain. Specifically, maleic anhydride groups may be reacted with primary amine-terminated 
PEG, and remaining carboxylic acids can be conjugated to PEG via amidation chemistry.

We found that not only was this material able to form self-assemblies easily in water, but 
also formed stable coatings on carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles, and gold nanorods. These 
polymer-nanomaterial coatings showed stability to a range of pH’s, salt conditions, and introduction 
of serum. Finally, polymer-coated SWNTs exhibit remarkably long blood circulation (t1/2 22.1 h) 
upon intravenous injection into mice, when compared with the previous record of 5.4 h. 
Results and discussion 
Synthesis of polymers. Pyrene and phospholipid were chosen as lipophilic groups for 
attachment to biocompatible polymers. In the first synthetic step (see Supporting Information for 
methods), we used the free carboxylic acid of γPGA (Mn ~ 430 KDa) to couple 1-
methylaminopyrene via EDC amidation. In a second step, we used the remaining carboxylic acid 
groups of γPGA to attach amine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ethers (mPEG-NH2, MW 
5000) to afford the compound (2). The average number of pyrene moieties grafted to γPGA chains 
was determined by 1
H NMR estimated to be ~30% and ~70% of γPGA backbone was loaded with 
PEG chains. The lipophilic pyrene moiety was then replaced by the biocompatible phospholipid 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) by first PEGylating γPGA and then 
grafting the lipophilic phopholipid moiety in the final step (see Supporting Information for 
methods) to afford the compound (3). The average numbers of DSPE and PEG moieties grafted to 
γPGA chains were determined by 1
H NMR, to be ~10% and ~60% respectively. 
 We also synthesized a PEGylated amphiphilic polymer based on a poly(maleic anhydride￾alt-1-octadecene) (PMHC18) backbone. In this case the copolymer itself contains an alternating 
hydrophobic unit, the C18 chain. Specifically, in the first synthetic step (see Supporting Information 
for methods), maleic anhydride groups were reacted with primary amine-terminated poly(ethylene 
glycol) methyl ethers (mPEG-NH2). The remaining carboxylic acids of PMHC18 were coupled to 
additional mPEG-NH2 via EDC amidation to obtain a fully PEGylated, highly water soluble 

5 
amphiphile polymer (1). The average number of PEG moieties grafted to PMHC18 chains was 
determined by 1
H NMR, to be ~ 200% (2 molecules of mPEG per unit of PMHC18). 
All three polymers are completely soluble in both chloroform and in aqueous media. Thus, 
in aqueous conditions hydrophobicity-driven self-assembly would be expected. In particular, the 
aqueous polymers are able to form micelles. We measured the CMC (critical micelle concentration) 
for each polymer (see Supporting Information Fig. S1). Surface tension measurement yielded 
CMC’s of 0.2 mg/mL for 1, 0.3 mg/mL for 2 and 0.4 mg/mL for 3. Also, we used dynamic light 
scattering to measure the size distribution of the micelles self-assembled in water (see the 
Supporting Information Fig. S2-S3). The surfactant molecules’ mean hydrated diameters were ~17 
nm, ~33 nm and ~56 nm for 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Whereas micelles of the polymers have 
hydrated diameters of ~132 nm, ~232 nm and ~196 nm for 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
Functionalization of Carbon Nanotubes by 1-3. Fig. 2 (see also the Supporting 
Information Fig. S5-S6) illustrates that following sonication in polymer solutions, we obtain 
excellent suspensions of SWNTs stabilized in water by polymers (1-3) , even after removal of 
excess polymer by repeated vacuum filtration (200 nm pore size). SWNT suspensions showed 
excellent stability, without aggregation or deviation of native UV/Vis/NIR absorbance, at pH’s 
ranging from 1 to 12, at high temperature overnight, and in 50% fetal calf serum for 48 h. AFM 
images (Fig. 2b ) show mostly dispersed SWNTs with lengths of ~200 nm. The UV-Vis (Fig. 2c) 
absorbance spectrum of SWNTs shows van Hove singluarities typical of well-dispersed SWNTs, 
with characteristic E11 and E22 transistions. The pyrene, the C18, and DSPE moieties have a strong 
tendency to adsorb on SWNTs by hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media, and, when 
applicable, by π-stacking. In this way, we obtain robustly coated SWNTs in aqueous media. Proof 
of the intimate interaction between pyrene and the NT sidewall was observed by quenching of 
pyrene fluorescence (see Supporting Information S7) relative to free (2) with the same OD. Fig. 2d 

6 
shows the photoluminescence versus excitation (PLE) spectrum of SWNTs, the inherent NIR 
photoluminescent properties of SWNTs are retained when they are coated with (1). 
Functionalization of Gold Nanoparticles by 2-3. In addition to directly suspending NTs in the 
case of γPGA polymers (2 and 3), it is possible to exchange other nanostructures from their native 
capping ligand into our amphiphilic γPGA polymer. For example, very good suspensions of gold 
NPs in water were obtained through sonication for 10 min in the presence of excess 2 or 3 to 
displace citrate. Excess citrate was removed by dialysis, and the excess of surfactant was removed 
by repeated centrifugation. This procedure gave mostly dispersed nanoparticles, as shown by TEM 
(Fig. 3a). As with NTs, this suspension was observed to be stable under various conditions, such as 
neutral-basic pH’s, at 70°C overnight, and in 50% serum, showing no significant changes in 
suspension dispersity or absorbance after a 48 h incubation. In contrast, thiol-mPEG(5KDa), a 
strong and covalent passivator of gold nanoparticles, showed less stability. In particular, as shown 
in (Fig. 3b), the NPs-thiol-mPEG(5KDa) are stable only in the presence of excess thiol-mPEG (see 
the Supporting Information S9). Indeed if the excess of the thiol-mPEG is removed by 
centrifugation the solution of NPs becomes unstable, forming aggregates. The UV/visible spectrum 
(Fig. 3a) shows the absorbance of gold nanoparticles at 530 nm. In this case (see Supporting 
Information S8), the intensity of pyrene adsorbance is dampened due to perturbations of gold 
nanoparticles, suggesting direct interaction of pyrene with the gold surface.55 As in the case of NTs, 
the pyrene and DSPE moieties were adsorbed on the gold suface through hydrophobic interactions. 
Functionalization of Gold Nanorods by 2. We also used our polymeric amphiphile to 
suspend gold nanorods. For example, very good suspensions of gold NRs in water were obtained 
through sonication for 15 min in presence of excess 2 to displace CTAB (hexadecyl-trimethyl￾ammonium bromide). Excess CTAB was removed by dialysis, and the excess of surfactant was 
removed by repeated centrifugation. This procedure gave mostly dispersed nanorods, as shown by 
TEM and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy (Fig. 3c). Suspensions of gold nanorods with 2 were 

7 
stable at neutral-basic pH’s, at 70°C overnight, and in 50% serum for 48 h. This result is important 
because nanorods with covalent thiol-based passivation are unstable under similar conditions. The 
UV/vis absorbance spectrum in (Fig. 3c) shows the transverse and longitudinal adsorbance of gold 
nanorods suspended by (2) or by CTAB at 520 nm and 860 nm respectively. While the solutions 
were originally normalized to the same OD, removal of excess surfactant causes significant 
aggregation and consequent loss of plasmon absorbance for CTAB-suspended NRs, however NRs 
suspended by (2) remain stable, even in the presence of serum. Again, the intensity of pyrene 
absorbance is dampened (data not shown) by close proximity to the gold nanorods. The TEM 
picture shows the size distibution and dispersity of nanorods suspended with 2. 
Circulation time of Carbon Nanotubes functionalize by 1-3. Long blood circulation half￾life of a drug carrier is desired to improve the bioavailability of the drug. For most nanomaterials 
this has been an elusive goal. For example, after systemic administration, carbon nanotubes are 
gradually cleared from the circulating blood by macrophage uptake as part of the RES, which leads 
to accumulation in the liver and spleen. Therefore, prolonged circulation can only be achieved if 
rapid RES uptake is avoided. In our previous studies we have shown that surface-coating of SWNTs 
can delay RES uptake and thus increase blood circulation28, 56, 57. 
Hypothesizing that the pronounced PEG loading on the polymer-SWNTs would prolong the 
blood circulation, we injected these conjugates into mice. Importantly, we observed (Fig. 4a) a 
circulation half-life of 2.4 h for SWNTs coated with (3), a very long circulation half-life of 22.1 h 
for SWNTs coated with (2) and 18.9 h for SWNTs coated with (1), which were far longer than 
values reported by others, as well as our previous data obtained for DSPE-coupled linear PEG 
coated SWNTs (0.33 h for DSPE-l-2kPEG, 2.4 h for DSPE-l-5kPEG, Fig. 4b) or DSPE-branched 
PEG functionalized SWNTs (5.4 h for DSPE-br-7kPEG, Fig. 4 a&b). While the packing density of 
PEG coatings immobilized on nanotubes via conventional surfactants with single anchoring points 

8 
is limited by steric hindrance, the multiple lipophilic anchoring domains and multiple PEG chains 
of (2) and (1) allow continuous binding of the polymer onto the nanotube surface, yielding a highly 
dense PEG coating. Additionally, the molecular weight and functionalization density of each PEG 
branch was important for obtaining long circulation. Similar surfactants produced with mPEG 0.75 
kDa in lieu of 5 kDa led to significantly reduced circulation times. Moreover, functionalization of 
the γPGA backbone with less than 50% of mPEG 5KDa gave unsatisfactory circulation results. 
Thus, not only does this unique polymer coating hold promise for potential in vivo therapeutic 
applications, we have also been able to discern what aspects of the polymer lead to desirable 
properties in our SWNT conjugates. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, we report the synthesis of new versatile PEGylated branched polymers that 
provide stable suspensions of carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods. We used 
poly-γ-glutamic acid (γPGA) functionalized with either pyrene moieties or phospholipids to provide 
robust polymer-particle interactions and PEG, enhancing aqueous solubility and biocompatibility. 
We also used PEGylated poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMHC18) to provide very stable 
suspensions of carbon nanotubes. We showed that the SWNTs, Au NPs and Au NRs functionalized 
by these polymers show excellent stability in aqueous solutions, at different pH’s, and elevated 
temperatures, as well as in serum. Moreover, the polymer-coated SWNTs exhibit unprecedentedly 
long blood circulation (half-life 22.1 h for (2) and 18.9 h for (1)) upon intravenous injection into 
mice, far exceeding the previous record for circulation half-life of 5.4 h. All these characteristics 
make these very powerful materials for in vivo applications, including drug delivery or imaging.
