Presenting in Childhood

Health, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1
In congenital cystic malformations of the kidney,
as in other groups of disorders, the accuracy of
genetic counselling depends upon exact diagnosis.
This requires the breakdown of the main hetero￾geneous group into specific entities, each of which is
homogeneous from the genetic viewpoint and
therefore carries a predictable recurrence risk within
the family. It is particularly important to recog￾nize the group of 'wholly genetically determined'
conditions, those due to chromosomal and single
gene mutations, since these may be associated with
high risks for sibs or children of index patients.
The subject of the present study is 'true polycystic
disease of the kidneys' as defined from the patho￾logical viewpoint by Kissane (1966). In this group,
two entities were already well established when the
present survey was begun, and a possible third was
emerging.
The first entity to be established was the domi￾nantly inherited adult form of polycystic disease of
the kidneys. This was recognized as an hereditary
trait at least as early as i 899 by Steiner, and its mani￾festations in adults have been well described from
the clinical, pathological, and genetic viewpoints
(Oppenheimer, 1934; Fergusson, 1949; Dalgaard,
1957; Heggo, 1966). It is noteworthy that necropsy
series agree that in about one third of the patients
with this form of the disease there is associated
localized cystic malformation of the liver. Although
so well defined in adults, the occurrence of this adult
type in children had been recorded only rarely and
usually without pathological detail or illustration
(Steiner, 1899; Halbertsma, 1932; Savera, 1946;
Fergusson, 1949).
The second type of polycystic malformation of

the kidneys to be established is limited to children
of the perinatal age group. This type is always
associated with specific hepatic lesions, and is not
recorded as occurring in the same family as the
adult form. The family pattern is consistent with
autosomal recessive inheritance (Lundin and Olow,
1961; Osathanondh and Potter, 1964a; Heggo and
Natvig, 1965b).
A presumptive further entity was 'congenital
hepatic fibrosis' with cystic kidneys. It was re￾cognized that this association could occur in two or
more sibs in a family (Kerr et al, 1961; Kerr,
Warrick, and Hart-Mercer, 1962) but, in contrast
to the first two entities described, no uniform
clinical-pathological pattern had emerged for this
third group. Even the term 'congenital hepatic
fibrosis' was ill defined and some reports obviously
included more than one pathological type. Hither￾to the uncertainty concerning this third group was
expressed by Kissane (1966): 'it is not possible at
present to decide whether congenital hepatic fibro￾sis belongs among extrarenal lesions associated with
renal polycystic disease or is an unrelated pleiotropic
hereditary disorder, one manifestation of which may
be cysts in the kidneys'. In addition, the literature
included reports of occasional families with two or
more sibs affected with true polycystic disease of
the kidneys which came intermediate between the
severe perinatal form and the form occurring with
'congenital hepatic fibrosis'. Lightwood and Loots
(1932) recorded one such family. Other workers
obviously aware of these intermediate types included
Gwinn and Landing (1968). In defining the severe
type of disease, which they called 'infantile poly￾cystic disease of kidneys and liver' (rightly stressing
the importance of the associated hepatic lesion)
they noted that, while most children with this form
die in infancy, there may be the occasional survivor.
The present study confirms the occurrence of the
first entity, the adult dominant form of polycystic

disease in children. The second entity, the severe
perinatal form of polycystic disease is also confirmed.
Further, this severe form is shown to represent one
extreme in a series of entities which share quali￾tatively similar, though quantitatively varying, pat￾terns of renal and hepatic malformation. It is
shown how this concept can account both for the
group of 'congenital hepatic fibrosis' with cystic
kidneys and those intermediate familial cases which
could not previously be classified.
In the past, a variety of other types of cystic kid￾ney have been confused with true polycystic disease,
particularly in the newborn, and these have been
excluded from the present series. The most
numerous of these are the cystic dysplastic group,
including unilateral cystic dysplastic kidney-the
commonest cystic renal disorder in childhood
(Kissane, 1966)-and cystic kidneys in association
with lower urinary tract obstruction. For this
large group there is little evidence of genetic deter￾mination and this also probably applies to single and
multilocular renal cysts.
Also excluded from the series are the rarer types of
renal cystic malformation which may occur as one
feature of wholly genetically determined syndromes.
Examples of chromosome anomalies in which cystic
kidneys may occur include Patau's and Edwards'
syndromes (Osathanondh and Potter, 1964b;
Taylor, 1968). In such instances there is little
risk to sibs unless the effective trisomy results from
a balanced translocation in one or other parent.
Single gene determined conditions include tube￾rose sclerosis-an autosomal dominant disorder
(Debre et al, 1952; Cree, 1969)-and oral-facial￾digital syndrome, which is probably an X-linked
condition lethal in males (Doege et al, 1964; Tucker
et al, 1966). Further, at least two conditions which
are possibly autosomal recessive are represented in
the heterogeneous group of central nervous system
malformations associated with cystic kidneys. The
first is Gruber's syndrome, reviewed by Opitz and
Howe (1969), who prefer the term Meckel's syn￾drome; the second is the association of cystic kid￾neys with the Dandy-Walker malformation of the
brain (D'Agostino et al, 1963). The Zellweger
syndrome (reviewed by Opitz et al, 1969) is another
probably recessive syndrome in which cysts have
regularly been found in the kidneys.
Single gene determined entities may also be repre￾sented in the heterogeneous group of renal cystic
disorders which are characterized by medullary
cysts. One severe form has been described in sibs
(Handa and Tennant, 1968); this form has been
equated with Fanconi's recessive juvenile nephro￾nophthisis (Mongeau and Worthen, 1967; Pedreira,
Marmer, and Bergstrom, 1968) but this identifica￾tion is by no means proven. A milder form com￾patible with dominant inheritance occurred in the
large kindred recorded by Goldman et al (1966).
'Medullary sponge kidney' (Abeshouse and
Abeshouse, 1960) is another entity, and has only
rarely been described in more than one member of a
family (see the review by Pennisi and Bunts, 1960;
also Copping, 1967).
The present survey was undertaken because of
confusion in the past between the many types of
renal cystic disorder, and because genetic counsel￾ling had proved difficult in the case of a child with
cystic disease of the kidneys who did not fit into
any of the recognized genetic groups. It was
hoped that, by studying an unselected series of
patients admitted to a children's hospital and their
families, it would be possible to define the different
forms of true polycystic disease which occur in
childhood, and the clinical and pathological criteria
by which they may be recognized.
Methods
The subjects of this study were patients admitted to
The Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street,
and from families attending the genetic clinic at the same
hospital.
The hospital patients were ascertained in one or more
different ways. (1) By means of the surgical histology
and post-mortem register of the Department of Morbid
Anatomy from 1948 to 1967 (inclusive). (2) Via the
coding system of the Medical Records Department since
its inception in 1951. (3) By direct notification from
members of the hospital staff who had a special interest
in renal disease. (4) Cases already known to one of the
authors, a member of the Department of Morbid Ana￾tomy.
In both the pathology registers and the medical records,
cases were sought under a wide variety of categories to
overcome differences in nomenclature adopted over the
years; these included 'cystic kidney', 'multicystic kidney',
'polycystic kidney', 'cystic liver', 'fibrosis of the liver',
'cirrhosis of the liver' etc. It was decided to include as
index patients only those cases with histological material
available for examination; patients diagnosed on clinical
or radiological grounds alone were not included in the
study. One patient found in this way who subsequently
died at another hospital was included in the study since,
following her death, necropsy material was sent to the
authors.
Going through the surgical specimen and post-mortem
records, it was possible immediately to reject certain
types of cystic malformation of the kidneys and cirrhosis
or fibrosis of the liver on the basis of the histological
descriptions and accompanying case summaries, or after
reference to the clinical case notes. Thus, cases of
cystic dysplastic kidneys and cases with cystic kidneys as
one feature of a recognized syndrome were excluded.

Polycystic Disease of Kidneys and Liver Presenting in Childhood
Similarly, cases of cirrhosis or fibrosis of the liver follow￾ing neonatal hepatitis or associated with biliary atresia,
and those secondary to a known disease, such as Wilson's
or glycogen storage disease, were all rejected at this
stage.
There remained 75 cases of cystic malformation of the
kidneys or fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver which could
not immediately be allocated to one of these recognized
groups or entities. In each case, the available sections
were examined and the case was only retained if the patho￾logical findings in the kidneys and/or liver conformed to,
or resembled, a certain pattern which will be described
later. Thirty-seven cases of cystic disease of the kidneys
which were considered to be unlike the required pat￾tern, and 21 cases of atypical fibrosis or cirrhosis of the
liver without malformation of the bile ducts were elimi￾nated in this way. Of the 17 cases which remained, 15
showed the specific pattern of renal and/or hepatic in￾volvement required (see Results, section A) and in 2
cases the renal lesion resembled the required pattern but
was not typical of it (see Results, section B). These 17
cases, who comprise the 'hospital index patients' be￾longed to 16 different families.
The families from the genetic clinic were traced from
the disease index for the clinic. This index was started
in 1957 and the search was made through the years
1957-1967. Here, all families registered under 'diseases
of kidney' and 'diseases of liver' were traced, but only
those in whom the diagnosis was that of cystic disease of
the kidneys or of primary liver disorder were reviewed
further. Of the 17 families traced in this way, 2 were
already included in the hospital series having been
selected by means of the pathology records, leaving a
total of 15 new families for review. As with the
hospital series, it was decided to include only those
families in which the diagnosis could be confirmed
histologically by the authors in at least one member,
usually on specimens supplied by colleagues from other
hospitals. This meant the elimination of 7 families:
one could not be traced; histological sections were not
available for 3 families; and in 3 other families review of
the kidney sections showed the pattern of renal cystic
disorder to be other than that specified by the authors.
In the remaining 8 families, histological assessment
showed that in 6 families (10 patients assessed) the kid￾ney and/or liver abnormalities conformed to the pat￾tern required (see Results, section A) and in 2 families (2
patients and 2 fetuses assessed) the renal lesion, while
somewhat resembling the required pattern, was not
typical (see Results, section B). These 8 families com￾prise the 'genetic clinic families' in the present series and,
in them 12 full-term children and 2 fetuses have been
examined histologically by the authors.
The total series of 29 patients assessed in 24 families is
summarized in Table I.

the family doctor advised against any approach to them,
and he kindly provided the sibship details in this family.

found are considered first; the four remaining
children in the series are discussed below (Results,
section B). At the start of this study one of the
authors (B.G.O.) was already familiar with this
pattern as it occurs in the perinatal age group. It
had been well described (Osathanondh and Potter,
1964a; Heggo and Natvig, 1965a and b; Kissane,
1966; and others) and had been encountered in
patients outside the present hospital experience.
The pattern of renal and hepatic involvement,
which was made the criterion in defining the index
patients, is as follows.
(1) Renal lesion. Throughout both kidneys
there is a uniform distribution of radially arranged
fusiform cysts. These are produced by dilated
distal and collecting tubules and are lined by cuboi￾dal or low columnar epithelium. The glomeruli,
intertubular tissue, calyces, pelves, ureters, and
lower urinary tracts are normal (Fig. 1).
(2) Hepatic lesion. In the liver there is a bizarre
infolding, proliferation, and dilatation of well￾differentiated portal bile ducts and ductules, associ￾ated with a variable degree of periportal fibrosis.
The malformation affects all the portal triads and is
uniformly distributed throughout the organ, the
hepatic lobular architecture being well preserved
(Fig. 2).
The association of these particular renal and
hepatic lesions was found in children of all ages in
the present series, though the extent of the lesions
varied between one age group and another as will be
described later. This very specific combination of
kidney and liver malformations is therefore desig￾nated the 'Childhood type of polycystic disease of
kidneys and liver'.
At the completion of the study (April, 1968), of
the 25 children in the series with this Childhood
type of polycystic disease, 18 were dead and 7 living.
In making the histological diagnosis (see Table II)
both renal and hepatic tissues were available in
each of 20 cases, the material being post mortem in
14 (using the family numbers given in Table IV to
VII, these were the first and third children in
family 1, first child in family 5, and children in
families 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, and 19), and
surgical biopsy in 6 (families 7, 12, 14, 16, and 17).

In two (second children in families 1 and 5) post￾mortem diagnosis was made on renal histology
alone, but in each instance sections of both kidneys
and liver were available for a sib. In one case, the
post-mortem diagnosis was made on hepatic his￾tology alone (family 13): the kidneys of this child
had been noted to be 'polycystic' at necropsy. In
the remaining two cases, who are alive (families 15
and 20) the diagnosis was confirmed on hepatic
biopsy only, but in both there was definite radio￾logical evidence of renal cystic disease.
No cystic malformations of other organs were
found in any of the cases examined.
Other congenital malformations identified were:
pulmonary stenosis (second child in family 5), short
left femur (family 6), talipes equinovarus (family 9),
and left duplex kidney and ureterocoele (family 18).

Polycystic Disease of Kidneys and Liver Presenting in Childhood
Clinical and Pathological Assessment of
Patients. The 25 cases showing the childhood
type of polycystic malformation of kidneys and liver
were assessed individually, firstly, on the basis of
the clinical findings, including age and mode of
presentation and progress; and secondly, the patho￾logical findings. The pathological assessment was
two-fold in each case. In the kidneys an esti￾mate was made of the proportion of renal tubules
that were cystic, and in the liver the degree of both
biliary malformation and periportal fibrosis were
assessed. On the basis of either the clinical findings
or the pathological assessment the 25 cases were
found to fall into the same 4 contiguous groups.
These were named after the age at presentation:
(1) Perinatal (2) Neonatal (3) Infantile, and (4) Juve￾nile groups. The clinical and pathological findings
in the 4 groups are summarized in Table III and
further details are given below. In this table and
Tables IV to VII, the families are numbered in
alphabetical order of surname within each group.
Genetic Considerations. The 25 patients
examined histologically by the authors, of whom 15
were hospital and 10 genetic clinic cases, belonged
to 20 different families. On grouping the patients
into the 4 groups-perinatal, neonatal, infantile, and
juvenile-on clinico-pathological criteria, it was
found that there was no overlap of these four
groups within families; that is, within any given
family all the children examined were found to fall
into one and the same group.
Description of the 4 Groups.
1. Perinatal group (9 patients assessed in 6 families).
Of the families included in this group, four were
genetic clinic families and two were hospital fami￾lies. Details of the sibships are given in Table IV.

with very marked abdominal distension due to huge
symmetrical renal masses. None of them sur￾vived to 6 weeks. Taking family 1 as an example,

soon after birth-when they were referred to the
genetic clinic and given a 1 in 4 risk of recurrence.
Subsequently a third affected child was born. The
first baby was delivered by forceps for fetal distress,
the other two by lower segment Caesarean section;
the mother was sterilized at the time of the second
abdominal operation. None of the infants survived
for more than a few hours. In each case the ne￾cropsy showed gross bilateral renal enlargement
with preservation of the normal reniform shape;
the kidneys of one child were described as being
larger than those of a normal adult. The cut sur￾faces showed that the enlargement was due to a
uniform distribution of radially arranged elongated
cystic tubules, with preservation of the cortico￾medullary pattern and normal pelves. The livers
were noted to be normal in size, congested, and the
cut surfaces were not apparently cystic. Sections
of the kidneys of all three babies in family 1 were
much alike; in each there was cystic malformation of
90 per cent or more of the tubules (Fig. 1). Sections
of the liver were examined in the first and third
children, and again the histological resemblance
between the two was striking; all the bile ducts and
ductules showed ectasia and there was minimal
periportal fibrosis (Fig. 2). Macroscopic photo￾graphs of the kidneys and liver are not available for
any of the children in this family, but the macro￾scopic appearances of the kidneys and liver in the
child in family 2 are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, and the
microscopic appearances in Figures 5a and b and 6.
The close similarity between the histological
findings in the children in family 1 and the child in
family 2 is shown in Figs. 1 and 5 and Figs. 2 and 6.
In this first group, identical histological appearances
were seen in the kidneys and liver in every case.
The only difference was in the recorded macroscopic
appearance of the liver. In each infant in family 1,
FIG. 4. Family 2. Macrophotograph of cut surface of liver show￾ing fibrosis of portal tracts some of which contain biliary cysts. ( x 1. )
it was noted that cysts were not seen, in the cases iu
families 2 and 4 small cysts were noted, and in
families 3, 5, and 6 there was no mention as to the
presence or absence of liver cysts.
Considering now the 6 families represented in this
group, in each of two families-family 1 (already
described) and family 5-there was more than one
affected child in the sibship. In addition to the
patients examined there were 7 unaffected sibs of
whom one, a boy in family 4 died at the age of one
year but, according to the family doctor, 'did not have
polycystic kidneys'. Four other children born into
these families were either stillborn or died soon after
birth. Two of them, in family 4, were premature
twin girls, reported as being 'uniovular' (presumably
on the basis of there being one placenta). These
twins were both breech presentations; the first died
at age one day, birth weight 2 lb; the second was
stillborn, birth weight 2 lb 3 oz: there was no
necropsy for either child. The child in family 3 who
died 7 hours after birth was thought to have atelecta￾sis, but again there was no necropsy. A necropsy
was performed on the premature macerated male
infant in family 5 and sections showed suspicious
dilatation and elongation of the renal tubules bu

nosis to be made.
In family 5, both parents had normal intravenous
pyelograms.
2. Neonatal group (6 patients assessed in 5
families). Of these families two were genetic
clinic and three hospital families. Details of the
sibships are given in Table V.
The children in this group all presented within
the first month of life with abdominal distension
due to bilaterally enlarged kidneys. Five died be￾fore the age of 8 months from progressive renal
failure, the one surviving child of the group was 8

(right) and 400 g (left). On bisection they were
entirely cystic, some of the cysts containing puru￾lent material (Fig. 8). The pelves, ureters and
bladder were normal. Microscopically about 60 per
cent of the renal tubules were dilated (about 1 in 5
grossly, and of the rest about 1 in 2 moderately).
Foci of acute pyelonephritis were seen (Fig. 9).
The liver weighed 252 g, was brown in colour, of
firm consistency, and mottled. Bisection revealed
several cystic portal areas scattered diffusely
throughout both lobes; the cysts were thin walled
and contained apparently clear fluid (Fig. 10).
Microscopically, all the intrahepatic bile ducts were
abnormal; the larger ducts were enormously dilated
and serpiginous, and the smaller ducts and ductules
were moderately increased in number and also
serpiginous. There was mild portal fibrosis and
cholangitis (Fig. 11).

patients examined-which included the affected boy

months old on 31 March 1968. Those who suc￾cumbed earliest probably did so because of pyelo￾nephritis and/or cholangitis. The affected boy in
family 9 is typical of the group as a whole: abdomi￾nal distension was noticed on the first day of life and
examination revealed easily palpable kidneys. At 3
weeks he was oedematous with a very distended
abdomen due to massive enlargement of both kid￾neys and hepatic enlargement (Fig. 7). Wedge
biopsy of the left kidney at age one month con￾firmed the clinical diagnosis of polycystic disease of
the kidneys and liver. His progress was steadily
downhill with a rising blood urea and increasing
dyspnoea. He died at age 5 weeks, the terminal
blood urea being over 300 mg/100 ml. Necropsy
showed polycystic disease of the kidneys with
superimposed acute pyelonephritis, polycystic
disease of the liver, and left ventricular hypertrophy FIG. 8- Family 9. Macrophotograph of kidneys showing fetal

in family 11 born after referral to the genetic clinic￾there were 2 affected sibs, 7 unaffected, and one
miscarriage. The two affected sibs were two
younger sisters of the index patient in family 9.
The elder of these 2 children was noted by the
mother to have abdominal enlargement from birth.
On examination at another hospital at 7 months she
was found to have a very protruberant abdomen
with hard masses palpable in both loins. The diag￾nosis of polycystic disease of the kidneys was made
mainly on clinical grounds, supported by the radio￾logical appearance after intramuscular pyelogram.
She died in uraemia at 5 years 10 months, the blood
urea having risen steadily from 72 mg/100 ml at 7
months to more than 500 mg/100 ml shortly before
death. Permission for necropsy was not granted.
The younger of the two affected sibs was very dis￾tressed at birth, and on examination at the same
hospital as her sister both kidneys were found to be
enlarged, extending into the iliac fossae. At 3
weeks of age the blood urea was 85 mg/100 ml;
she gradually developed signs of uraemia and died
suddenly at home at 3 months. Again no necropsy
was permitted.

to have hepatosplenomegaly and palpable kidneys.
In these children the clinical picture was either of
onset of chronic renal failure with raised blood
urea, renal rickets and secondary hyperpara￾thyroidism, or of increasing portal hypertension￾with oesophageal varices and haematemeses-re￾quiring portocaval shunt. Bilateral cystic kidneys
were demonstrated on intravenous pyelogram in all
except the girl in family 13 in whom they were
demonstrated at necropsy. At the time of study
two children were dead: the girl in family 13 who
died at age 7 years 10 months in uraemia, and the
girl in family 16, who died at 6 years 8 months from
haematemeses (following closure of a portocaval
shunt performed when she was three and a half).
The 3 surviving children included the boy in
family 14 whose portocaval anastomosis, carried out
following haematemeses at the age of 2 years, re￾mained patent.
In this group of children, macroscopically the
kidneys were enlarged, though not always markedly
so, and all were cystic. In three children this was
seen at operation and in one at necropsy. Histo￾logically about a quarter of the renal tubules were

cystically dilated in both cortex and medulla (Fig.
12). The livers were seen to be enlarged and hard
-at operation in 4 and at necropsy in one child.
Histologically every case showed dilatation and in￾folding of all the intrahepatic bile ducts and ductules
available for inspection, and moderate accompanying
periportal fibrosis (Fig. 13).
In this group of 5 families, in addition to the
patients examined there were one affected and 10
unaffected sibs, one premature stillborn child￾for whom there was no post-mortem examination
-and two miscarriages. The one affected sib was
the younger brother of the girl index patient in
family 12. When he was two days old enlarged
kidneys were palpated by the family doctor, and on
admission to hospital his liver also was easily
palpable. Blood urea at the age of one week was
131 mg/100 ml and intravenous pyelogram showed
'the appearances of the infantile form of congenital
polycystic disease'. This boy, like his sister, was
still surviving (aged 2 years 11 months) at the time
of study.

except for the child in family 18 whose liver en￾largement was noted at 6 weeks when she was in
hospital because of meningitis secondary to um￾bilical sepsis. Early splenic enlargement was also
noted in each case but renal enlargement was vari￾able. Typically, the clinical picture was that of
portal obstruction; in one child, the girl in familyl7,
the effect was minimal-requiring no surgical
intervention-but in 3 children, the boy in family 17
and the children in families 19 and 20, portocaval
shunt was required at the ages of 6, 11, and 12 re￾spectively. The 5th child, in family 18 died at age

umbilical sepsis, but even at this age there was
splenic enlargement and early periportal fibrosis in
the liver. Of the 3 children whose portal hyper￾tension was relieved by anastomosis, the two boys

rated by pyelonephritis and died in uraemia just
before her 21st birthday.
The pathological findings in the children in
family 17 illustrate those of the group as a whole and
also illustrate the close resemblance between sibs.
In this family, the girl was found to have an en￾larged liver at age 5 years 6 months, and her brother
at 2 years 3 months, the family doctor found this
during a routine examination in each child. On re￾ferral to hospital, splenic but not renal enlargement
was also found in both. Figure 14 shows these
children at the ages of 8 and 4. The boy began to
have haematemeses at 4 years and a portocaval shunt
was performed at 6 years. At operation the liver
was seen to be large, very hard, and finely mottled;
the right kidney was lobulated, normal in size, and
one small cyst was seen on the surface. Biopsies
were taken from both organs (Figs. 15 and 16).
Percutaneous liver and kidney biopsies were taken
from the girl.
Microscopically the livers of both children
showed typical biliary dilatation and infolding￾affecting all the ducts and ductules-and marked
biliary fibrosis, which in the boy was gross. The
kidneys of both showed dilatation of about 1 in 10 or
less of the tubules, uniformly distributed through￾out cortex and medulla.
In the 4 sibships, in addition to the patients
examined there were two unaffected sibs (one of
these-in family 18-was stillborn and necropsy
confirmed that the liver and kidneys were normal,
death being due to tentorial tear and congenital
heart disease). In family 18, the mother had two
intravenous pyelograms following passage of a
renal calculus, both pyelograms were reported as
being normal.

Polycystic Disease of Kidneys and Liver Presenting in Childhood
B. Adult Type of Polycystic Disease of
Kidneys and Liver
Two children in the hospital series and two
children and two fetuses in the genetic clinic fami￾lies proved to have a different pattern of cystic
malformation of the kidneys from that already de￾scribed as the Childhood type. Although initially
there was some difficulty in separating these patients
from the major group on histological grounds,
particularly where only a small biopsy was available,
characteristic differences emerged as the study pro￾ceeded. Followup of the families finally confirmed
the recognition of these cases as a separate group.
It became clear from this combined study that these
patients had in fact the Adult dominant form of
polycystic disease of the kidneys which happened
to present in them at an unusually early age.
The patients and their families are described
briefly in turn, each family being denoted by the
first letter of the sumame.
Family D (genetic clinic family).
Patient. A boy born in October 1962, birth
weight 7 lb 4 oz showed satisfactory progress until,
at 5 months he began to have increasing dyspnoea.
On admission to hospital at 7 months the baby
looked ill and wasted. Blood pressure was

thought to be polycystic kidneys-were felt arising
from both loins, and the liver edge was just palp￾able. He went into left ventricular failure and died
at 7 months.
At necropsy, both kidneys (left-162 g, right￾184 g) were found to be considerably enlarged by
many small thin-walled cysts containing clear
watery fluid. Cysts varied in size from 0-1 to 2-0 cm
and only small areas of recognizable renal tissue re￾mained. The lower urinary tract was normal. A
single thin-walled cyst was present deep in the right
lobe of the liver. In the head of the pancreas was a
cluster of small cysts containing clear fluid. All
other organs were normal.
Microscopically, both kidneys contained multiple
clusters of cystic tubules of varying size in cortex
and medulla, with intervening foci of normal renal
tissue (Fig. 17). In the liver, no lesions were found
other than the biliary cyst already described in the
right lobe, despite examination of numerous blocks.
Family. The mother had previously had a nor￾mal daughterand onemiscarriage; after the patient she
had a son who was clinically normal on examination
at hospital at age one. The parents and all 4
grandparents were alive and well at the time of
study; none of them had had symptoms referable
to the renal tract or any urological investigation.
Family S (hospital case)
Patient. A boy born October 1958 was well un￾til the age of 6 years when he had sudden haema￾turia. Investigation revealed a mass in the region
of the left kidney, and a left nephrectomy was per￾formed at age 6. The right kidney looked and felt
normal. The excised kidney was greatly enlarged
-weighing 628 g and measuring 15 x 10 x 8 cm￾and contained numerous cysts of greatly varying
size, many of which contained pus; patches of ap￾parently normal renal parenchyma lay between the
larger cysts (Fig. 18). A section of the kidney is
shown in Figure 19. Subsequent intravenous
pyelogram showed the right kidney to be radio￾logically normal. The child has remained well.
Family. The patient had one younger brother
who was well; his intravenous pyelogram in 1965 was
reported normal, a slight irregularity of the left

kidney being considered of no significance. The
mother was well; the father had congenital heart
disease with subacute bacterial endocarditis. All 4
grandparents were alive and none was known to have
had renal disease.
Family H (hospital case)
Patient. A girl, born August 1962. From
birth she had had a 'big tummy'; was always thirsty
and lived on yoghourt rather than on solid foods.
At two years she was admitted to hospital with abdo￾minal distension, pallor, and fever; intravenous
pyelogram showed the left kidney to be enlarged
and irregularly cystic, the right kidney being ap￾parently normal. A left nephrectomy was per￾formed and the excised kidney was enlarged and
contained infected cysts of greatly varying size; the
pelvis was normal (Fig. 20). Histologically there
were irregularly distributed cystic tubules of varying
size in both the cortex and medulla with intervening
segments of normal renal tissue and superimposed
acute pyelonephritis (Fig. 21). The child im￾proved considerably after operation. At age four,
her right kidney became palpable. Intravenous
pyelogram confirmed the enlargement and showed a

indicating cystic spaces filled with contrast medium.
A needle liver biopsy taken at this time showed no
histological abnormality of the one included portal
tract. The child was 5 years 7 months at the time
of this study; a craggy mass was palpable in the
right loin, she had a blood urea in the region of
60 mg/100 ml and variable hypertension.
Family. The family pedigree is shown in Figure
22. A younger brother was well and had a normal
intravenous pyelogram. The mother was also
well. The father (II.5) was well until the age of 32
when he began to have attacks of pain in the left
loin. Investigation showed a palpable right kidney
(though neither the left kidney nor the liver could
be felt) and hypertension of 210/140 when standing
and 160/110 when lying. Nephrotomogram showed
enlargement of both kidneys with the typical de￾formities of the adult type of polycystic disease.
The blood urea was only 36 mg/100 ml.
The mother then had an unplanned pregnancy
and asked for a termination. This was carried out
at an estimated 14 weeks after conception and twin
male fetuses were found (III.3 and 4). There were
no macroscopically visible cysts in the kidneys or
other organs of these fetuses but microscopic
examination revealed a few cortical and medullary
cystic tubules in both kidneys of both fetuses (Figs.
23a and b). These were described by the patholo￾gist who carried out the necropsies; the present
authors agreed with him and found no similar
lesions in the kidneys of 8 control fetuses of 14
to 19 weeks gestation. The livers of these twin
fetuses were not retained for histology.
Family L (genetic clinic family)
Patient. A girl, born December 1965 by Caesa￾rean section for breech presentation. At two weeks
she was found to have bilateral huge renal masses
and her blood urea was 57 mg/100 ml. Intra￾venous pyelogram at one month showed the

and she died in uraemia at age 3 months.
At necropsy both kidneys were found to be
grossly and uniformly enlarged by cysts of greatly
varying size (Fig. 24). The lower urinary tract was

otherwise normal. The heart showed gross left
ventricular hypertrophy. There was a right
coloboma and no other abnormalities.
Microscopically the kidneys showed grossly cystic
tubules of greatly varying size in both cortex and
medulla and small foci of normal renal tissue (Fig.
25). Nine blocks of liver were examined: in all the
sections only two portal tracts showed numerous in￾folded bile ducts and surrounding fibrosis, the re￾mainder were normal. Figure 26 illustrates one of
these small abnormal portal tracts in otherwise nor￾mal liver.

necropsy. Since the death of the infant (IV.4),
her great-aunt (11.3), aged 54 has been admitted to
hospital with a short history of bilateral loin pain
and other symptoms suggestive of a renal infection.
The left kidney was found to be enlarged and tender;
blood pressure was 190/120 and the blood urea
33 mg/100 ml. Subsequent intravenous pyelo￾gram showed the appearances of polycystic disease
of the kidneys.
The family data for the 4 families with the
Adult type of polycystic disease are shown in
Table IX.
Discussion
Interpretation of the Findings in the
Present Series
The first major finding of this study (see Results,
section A) is that a type of cystic malformation of
the kidneys occurs in children which has a charac￾teristic pattern of tubular involvement and uniform
distribution throughout both kidneys. This Child￾hood type of polycystic disease is always associated
with an equally characteristic pattern of intra￾hepatic biliary malformation, accompanied by
periportal fibrosis, and again the malformation is
uniformly distributed throughout the organ. It is
suggested that this basic pattern be designated the
'Childhood type of polycystic disease of kidneys
and liver'.
The second major finding (see Results, section A)
is that children affected with this type of lesion fall
into the same 4 groups, whether subdivided on the
basis of clinical severity or degree of renal tubular
involvement. These groups are called perinatal,
neonatal, infantile, and juvenile, in accordance with
the characteristic age at clinical presentation
(Table III). In the perinatal group there is maxi￾mal renal involvement, incompatible with survival
for more than a few weeks. In the juvenile group
the renal involvement is minimal and the infant
survives, but with increasing age there is progressive
periportal fibrosis, the cause of the morbidity in this
group. The neonatal and infantile groups are
intermediate between the other two.
The third major finding (Results, section B) is
that the Adult dominant form of polycystic disease
of the kidneys can present in infancy and early
childhood but the pattern of renal and hepatic in￾volvement differs in many respects from that of the
Childhood type of disease.
The first conclusion described above may be easier
to accept than the second. For example, patholo￾gists may agree with the concept of a basic pattern of
renal and hepatic malformations typically found in
childhood, but be reluctant to subdivide the affected
children further, preferring to view them as one
continuously varying group. This might be the
case were it not for the family evidence. In no
instance where a family contained more than one
affected child was it found that one child was classed
in one group and other children from the same sib￾ship in other groups; that is, only one clinico￾pathological group was represented within any one
family. In those families in which slides of kid￾neys and liver were available from more than one

child-families 1 and 5 in the perinatal group,
family 11 in the neonatal group, and family 17 in the
juvenile group-there was in fact a remarkable
intrafamilial similarity in the histological features.
For each of the other two families with more than
one affected child-families 9 and 12-it was not
possible to confirm the diagnosis histologically in
the children born subsequent to the index patient.
In family 9 both the affected sisters of the index
patient probably had enlarged kidneys from birth;
the elder girl however managed to survive to the age
of 5 years, a considerably longer life span than most
of the patients in this second, neonatal group, but
the younger girl lived for only 3 months. In
family 12, classified as belonging to the infantile
group, the younger brother of the index patient was
found to have enlarged kidneys soon after birth;
probably this early diagnosis was made because his
doctors were already alerted to the condition as it
appeared in his elder sister. His subsequent pro￾gress has resembled hers though clinically he is
the more severely affected of the two children.
There is therefore within-family clinical similarity
of the patients in these two families, also suggesting
that only one group is represented in each.
Genetic Analysis of Families with the Child￾hood Type of Disease. In none of the families
were there affected children other than in the sib￾ships of the patients examined histologically. In
none were the parents consanguineous. The family
data, summarized in Table VIII, show that the sex
ratio in each group does not differ significantly from
unity. On the assumption that each of the 4
groups represents a distinct genetic entity, with
equal representation of the sexes and recurrence
within the sibship but not elsewhere in the family,
the most likely inheritance mechanism is that a
separate autosomal recessive gene is responsible in
each group. The data for testing this hypothesis
are set out in Table X. In this Table, the hospital
cases represent an unselected series and in their
families the sibs are counted once for each index
patient (in only one family-family 17-are there
two index patients). The genetic clinic families
however are highly selected since referral tends to be
made after two or more affected children rather than
after one. For them, sibs included in Table X are
only those born subsequently to the parents' visit
to the clinic. The proportion of affected sibs in
each group is too small for tests of significance to be
applied, but in no case is the proportion in￾compatible with the 1 in 4 ratio expected on the
basis of autosomal recessive inheritance. The last
column of Table X shows the high total of 4 stillborn
babies compared with 32 live born sibs. At least
one of these stillborn infants (that in family 5) was
possibly affected-though in this case autolysis had
proceeded too far for certain diagnosis to be made￾and the 'unknown' group may well conceal further
affected infants. The baby in the genetic clinic

birth, was born before referral to the clinic and is
therefore not counted in the segregation analysis,
but may well have been affected also.
It therefore seems reasonable to propose that
children with the Childhood type of polycystic
disease of kidneys and liver can be divided into four
groups on clinical and pathological grounds, and that
a different mutant gene is responsible in each group.
These genes could perhaps be allelic, but there is no
information on this.
The renal lesions in the four children considered
to have the Adult type of disease resembled the
childhood type of pattern to some extent but were
not typical of it. The hepatic lesions were similar
in form but dissimilar in that they were focal and so
few that they were found only by chance. During
the study, family followup of these patients re￾vealed that in two of them-families H and L￾adult relatives were affected with the typical Adult
type of polycystic kidney disease. The interpre￾tation of the renal lesions in the two children in these
families then became clear: they represented an un￾usually severe form of dominantly inherited adult
cystic disease which happened, in them to present in
childhood. Review of the other two children-in
families D and S-showed that they had a similar
type of renal lesion. They are therefore also be￾lieved to represent the Adult dominant form of
polycystic disease of the kidneys presenting in
childhood.
Some other features of the Adult type of disease
are illustrated in the 4 families in this series, in
addition to the pattern of dominant inheritance.
First, the asymmetry in time of clinical manifesta￾tion and degree of involvement which can be a
feature of adult type polycystic disease (Braasch and
Schacht, 1932; Oppenheimer, 1934; Dalgaard,
1957) is illustrated in family H: the girl index
patient presented at 2 years with unilateral renal
enlargement, the other kidney appearing normal￾even on intravenous pyelogram-at that age. By
age 4, after removal of one kidney, the second
kidney became enlarged and detectably cystic. Also,
in the boy in family 5, the kidney which was re￾moved showed changes typical of Adult type poly￾cystic disease while the other kidney appeared
radiologically normal. Secondly, the striking varia￾tion in severity of clinical manifestation characteris￾tic of dominant conditions is shown in family L: the
mother of the severely affected infant is apparently
normal clinically and radiologically, though a known
transmitter. Her maternal aunt had little or no
trouble until a year before she was shown radio￾logically to have polycystic kidneys at 54 years of
age. Whether the mother develops signs or symp￾toms remains to be seen. Dalgaard (1957) thinks
that almost every carrier of this gene manifests it,
given a life span of 80 years! Similar lack of clini￾cal manifestation in one or other parent may ac￾count for the apparently isolated cases in families D
and S; alternatively, these children may have been
affected by fresh mutations. Lastly, the theory that
the Adult type of polycystic disease is a congenital
condition is supported by the finding of undoubted
cysts in the kidneys of the twin fetuses in family H.
Comparison of the Childhood and Adult
Types. In its clinical presentation and course, as
seen in the child in family L, the Adult type of
disease may superficially resemble the Childhood
type. However, the pathological and genetic
differences between the two types are quite clear
cut, as shown in Table XI.
Essential differences in distribution of the lesions
are that in the Childhood type both kidneys are
affected uniformly and symmetrically and the bili￾ary malformations are also uniformly distributed in
the liver; while in the Adult type the kidneys are
not necessarily symmetrically involved, the renal
cystic lesions are focal and unevenly distributed, and
the hepatic lesions are also focal and, as seen in the
present series, may only be identified by chance.
Interpretation of Previous Reports in
Relation to the Present Findings
From the early literature it is evident that, as the
Adult dominant form of polycystic disease of the
kidneys was becoming established as an entity,
there came-rather reluctantly-the recognition
that the form usually seen in the newborn was some￾thing quite different. Earlier workers, for instance
Kuster (quoted in Fergusson, 1949) had clearly
demonstrated two peaks in the age incidence of
polycystic disease of the kidneys: one peak at or
soon after birth, the other in middle life. Cairns
(1925) realized that there were two different
varieties: the 'adult type' and the 'congenital cystic
kidney of the fetus or newborn', but he concluded
that the latter were '. . . of greater value for a study
of difficult labour than for a study of heredity in
polycystic disease'. Marquardt (1935, 1936a, and
1936b) was probably the first to appreciate the
genetic distinction between the adult and infantile
types and to show that, whereas the disease is
dominant in adults, the lethal form in infants usually
follows a recessive pattern. The fact that he in￾cluded in his recessive group examples cited from
the literature which were of different aetiology-for
instance Bruckner's family (1869) was an obvious
example of what Opitz and Howe (1969) define as

Meckel's syndrome-does not detract from the
significance of his conclusion: that there are at
least two clinical forms each with a different pattern
of inheritance. Genetic differences of this sort, as
an aid in distinguishing entities within an hetero￾geneous group such as that of cystic kidneys were
surprisingly often ignored by contemporaries of
Marquardt. Even as recently as 1959, Arey in an
otherwise excellent discourse on cystic lesions of the
kidney in infants and children was reluctant to con￾cede that different modes of inheritance necessarily
imply different disease entities. Fergusson (1949)
however drew the distinction between the adult and
neonatal forms, making the point that they never
occur in the same family and appreciating the prog￾nostic significance of the distinction. He was also
concerned with latent cases of the Adult dominant
type of disease in childhood, and records one of the
few families in the literature in which a young child
had polycystic disease of proven Adult dominant
type.
It is convenient at this stage to consider further
the occurrence of the Adult type of disease in child￾hood since this has been a source of confusion in the
literature. Steiner (1899) described two affected
children, both aged 10, members of two different
families in each of which there was undoubted
dominant transmission of the disease. Halbertsma
(1932) described typical clinical and radiological
findings in a 10-year-old girl whose father was also
affected. The 2-year-old girl described by Savera
(1946) who died following appendectomy, was
found incidentally to have polycystic disease of the
kidneys, inherited through three generations of her
family. However, in all these cases, as in Fergus￾son's family, the diagnosis was made on clinical or
radiological grounds or at operation, and it has not
been possible to find a good pathological account of
the findings in young children, confirmed by the
family history as having the Adult dominant type of
disease. The present authors were fortunate in
being able to study children so affected, and to
establish the pattern of severe, but focal renal, and
minimal hepatic involvement of the Adult type as
seen in this age group.
Published work relating to the Childhood type
of polycystic disease is more difficult to unravel than
that for the Adult type. The latter represents a
single genetic entity with predominantly renal
pathology, the hepatic malformations-even when
present as multiple cysts in the adult-giving little
clinical trouble (Braasch and Schacht, 1932; and
others). The Childhood type of disease however is
essentially bipartite-both kidneys and liver being
uniformly and invariably involved in the morbid
process-and probably several distinct genetic
groups are represented, as suggested by the sub￾division of patients with this pattern of disease into
4 separate groups. One authority who recognized
the similarity of the liver lesion at different ages,
and the association of this very specific biliary mal￾formation and fibrosis in the liver with congenital
cystic kidneys was MacMahon (1929). He reported
6 cases varying in age from a 7-month fetus to a
15-year-old girl (his 7th case-'an elderly male'-the
oldest patient in his series was possibly an example

of the adult type of disease). However he did not
record the essential similarity or the quantitative
differences of the renal lesions in the different age
groups. MacMahon's was purely a pathological
study without clinical or family details, therefore he
did not pick up the associated high risk to sibs.
Parker (1956) and Kerr et al (1961) have noted the
association of 'congenital hepatic fibrosis' with
cystic kidneys in certain patients, but they do not
distinguish these patients as a separate group in an
otherwise heterogeneous series. Kerr and his
colleagues do however note the link between
'familial' cases of congenital hepatic fibrosis and
cystic kidneys. To quote from their paper: 'Com￾parison of familial and non-familial patients in our
own and previous series reveals only one important
difference: in 10 of 13 familial cases the patients had
associated congenital cystic kidneys compared with
6 of the 22 non-familial cases.' Kerr later follows
up this discovery with other colleagues (Kerr et al,
1962), but is still concerned only with patients who
have survived infancy. The resemblance between
the liver histology in patients with congenital hepa￾tic fibrosis, when associated with the very character￾istic pattern of intrahepatic biliary malformation
and with cystic kidneys, on the one hand, and in￾fants with the perinatal form of polycystic kidneys
on the other hand is not mentioned. Kissane (1966)
does note this resemblance.
It is difficult to find any previous suggestion in the
literature that the renal lesion is qualitatively similar
though quantitatively different in different age
groups. One pair of workers who did appreciate
this point to some extent, and suggested that there
may be many gradations of polycystic disease of the
kidneys was Reilly and Neuhauser (1960). They
also stress the importance of associated cystic
disease of the liver. However, except for the single
family-reported from the clinical viewpoint by
Lathrop (1959)-which they include in their series,
family information is lacking, and the authors are
concerned with radiographic appearances in the
patients rather than with the identification of dis￾crete entities.
Lastly, families reported in the literature in which
more than one child appears to be affected by the
Childhood type of disease should provide evi￾dence for or against the suggested subdivision into
4 groups. The authors' intepretation that these
groups represent different single gene determined
entities is only valid if there is no overlap between
groups within any given family-in other series as
well as their own. They have therefore reviewed
as many as possible of the recently recorded families
and assigned them to one or other group on the
basis of the criteria described, noting for each
family whether the suggested grouping applies
equally to all the affected children or whether more
than one group appears to be represented in the sib￾ship. There are obvious limitations in interpreting
the findings of other workers in this way: for ex￾ample, histological illustrations, however good, are
no substitute for sections when judging the degree
of renal involvement. Nevertheless the following
rough assessment is possible.
1. Perinatal Group. Marquardt (1935) de￾scribed a family with two affected infants each of
whom, from the clinical description might be classi￾fiable in the perinatal group, but there are no histo￾logical illustrations to confirm this.
Case 1 of Parker (1956) had all the features of the
perinatal group; an older sib had died at 6 hours,
and was thought to have had congenital cystic
kidneys.
Dalgaard (1957), in Table 34 gives details of 40
propositi with the 'congenital form' of polycystic
kidney; 15 were stillborn. This is obviously a
heterogeneous collection of entities, but single cases
which would be compatible with those in the peri￾natal group can be discerned. Of the instances of
occurrence in sibs, none represents the perinatal
group: in two families the babies also had central
nervous system malformations, and in one family
they both survived for several months.
Group I of Lundin and Olow (1961) corresponds
with the perinatal group of the present authors. Of
the 9 cases in this group, there were 3 pairs of sibs;
all the babies died within 4 hours of birth. Their
report is one of the few to include family details as
well as illustrations of the renal histology. They
also give a genetic analysis of the families in group I,
showing that they are compatible with recessive in￾heritance.
Heggo and Natvig (1965a and b) describe 5 cases
of 'Potter's so-called hamartomatous variety of
cystic kidney' which could all be classified in the
perinatal group. All the children died within 48
hours of birth, and showed exactly the same clinical
and pathological features as each other and as the
cases described in the present series. There are
very good pathological illustrations in these papers
and, as in the present authors' cases, sections from
any one of these 5 infants could equally well have
been taken from any of the others. The 5 infants
belonged to 3 different families, and in the genetic
analysis it is shown that the risk to sibs is in ac￾cordance with that expected on the basis of auto￾somal recessive inheritance.

Polycystic Disease of Kidneys and Liver Presenting in Childhood
viously correlates with the perinatal group. They
stress the uniformity of involvement in kidneys and
liver, and note that this is the group in which af￾fected sibs occur but give no actual family data.
Von Fasske (1967) described a family with three
stillborn infants, each of whom showed all the
features characteristic of the perinatal group.
2. Neonatal Group. Oppenheimer (1934) de￾scribed a series of 60 patients of whom 59 had the
adult type of polycystic kidney disease. The re￾maining patient was a newborn girl who died at the
age of 6 months; necropsy showed bilateral poly￾cystic kidneys and 'fatty infiltration of the liver'.
Three other infants in the same sibship had died
young. This family possibly accords with the
neonatal group.
Dalgaard (1957), as previously mentioned, de￾scribed one pair of sibs each of whom survived for
some months, suggesting that they would not have
been as severely affected as those in the perinatal
group, and this family is a possible example of the
neonatal group.
Hooper (1958) described identical twin girls both
of whom died at the age of 3 months; necropsy
showed bilaterally enlarged lobulated kidneys filled
with minute cystic spaces. A macroscopic photo￾graph of the kidney is shown but there is no histo￾logy.
Aurich (1967) described a family in which 5 of 8
children had bilateral polycystic kidneys and 'cystic
dysplasia of the liver'. These children died at the
ages of 83 days, 52 days, 10 months, 21 days, and 6
hours. From the microphotographs it is not pos￾sible to assess the number of renal tubules involved.
Since one child survived to the age of 10 months it is
suggested that this family might well be an example
of the neonatal group. The fact that one baby died
within a few hours of birth is not, of itself, an indica￾tion for inclusion in the perinatal group. This is
one family in which kidney sections from all the
infants would have been particularly valuable.
Becker et al (1969) described what appears to be
the Childhood type of disease in three of four sib￾lings. One of the 3 survived until 5 months, the
other two died in a matter of hours after birth.
Microphotographs suggest that all these babies
might have belonged to the neonatal group; the two
early deaths were probably attributable to hyaline
membrane disease.
3. Infantile Group. Bunting (1906) described
a pair of sibs, one of whom died at 11 days the other
at 19 days. Both had cystic disease of the kidneys
and liver, and one of them had cysts in the pancreas;
there are good pathological descriptions but no
illustrations. If these babies had the Childhood
type of disease, they would probably both come into
the infantile group because the kidneys were said to
be only slightly enlarged and relatively few renal
tubules were affected (mainly collecting tubules in
the medulla). Factors such as prematurity no
doubt contributed to their early demise.
Lightwood and Loots (1932) described a family in
which 3 children had fibrosis of the liver with
congenital cystic kidneys, a 4th child may also
have been affected. One of these children lived
to the age of 1 year and 10 months, one was alive
at 4 years and one at 1 year 11 months. Details of a
necropsy performed on the first child are given, but
no illustrations. The findings suggest that this
child may have been an example of the infantile
group and the clinical findings in the other two
children are also compatible with this grouping.
Kerr et al (1962) note that, in their series of
patients with congenital hepatic fibrosis and cystic
kidneys, a few are not easily assigned to any of their
3 groups: classical adult polycystic disease, medul￾lary sponge kidney, and congenital hepatic fibrosis
with renal lesions. Their case 15 is one such
patient, and although this is not a 'familial' case,
attention is drawn to this girl as a possible example
of the infantile group. In fact the history and post￾mortem findings for this patient closely resemble
those of the child in family 12 of the present series.
Cases 6 and 7 in the series of Jamaican children
with congenital hepatic fibrosis described by
Thorburn, Miller, and Bras (1967) are sibs, and
both appear to fit into the infantile group.
The first child described in the paper by Brad￾ford et al (1968) developed haematemesis at the age
of 4 and died about a year later. Necropsy showed
the typical intrahepatic biliary pattern and portal
fibrosis of the Childhood type of disease; micro￾scopically there were dilated tubules throughout the
cortex and medulla of both kidneys. An older sister
of this patient had died at the age of two with 'cystic
disease and bad liver'. The findings in both
children are compatible with those of the infantile
group, as far as it is possible to judge without actu￾ally seeing the sections.
4. Juvenile Group. The three affected sibs,
two of them identical twins, described in the paper
by Campbell et al (1958) would probably all come
within the juvenile group.
Lathrop (1959) described a family in which 4
(possibly 5) affected children in a sibship of 7 had
signs of portal hypertension and cystic kidneys. At
least 3 of these children appear to correspond to the

juvenile group of the present paper. Reilly and
Nuehauser (1960) describe the same family from the
radiological viewpoint.
Sweetnam and Sykes' family (1961) also corre￾lates well with the juvenile group. In this family
the elder girl presented with haematemesis at age 5,
requiring portocaval anastomosis at 6; the affected
boy presented at age 2 with an enlarged abdomen,
and portocaval anastomosis was carried out at 5
years. The 3rd affected child died before the age
of two from septicaemia, and necropsy showed 'the
typical changes of hepatic fibrosis, and cystic kid￾neys with superimposed pyelonephritis. After the
discovery of cystic kidneys in this 3rd child, the
two surviving children-neither of whom had symp￾toms referable to the renal tract-were examined
radiologically and the boy, who had previously been
normal on x-ray was now found to have cystic
kidneys.
Kerr and colleagues (Kerr et al, 1961) reviewed
all published cases of congenital hepatic fibrosis,
adding 13 new ones. Of the new cases the only
'familial' ones were the 3 children in the family re￾ported by Sweetnam and Sykes (see above). With
other colleagues, Kerr (Kerr et al, 1962) reviews 9
of the patients already described in the 1961 paper,
and adds 6 new cases. Several of these new cases
appear to correspond with the juvenile group; two
of them, cases 13 and 14, are sibs.
Bradford et al (1968) in case 2 describe a 6-year￾old girl who presented with haematemeses and
hepatomegaly, and was shown on IVP to have poly￾cystic kidneys. An illustration from the liver
biopsy shows the characteristic biliary malformation
and fibrosis of the childhood type of disease but
there is no renal illustration. A 2-year-old brother
had an enlarged liver and spleen and normal IVP.
These findings are compatible with those of a
family in the juvenile group, but the information
that the maternal grandfather had died from cere￾bral vascular disease complicating polycystic disease
of the kidneys (presumably Adult type) cannot be
similarly explained. Professor W. D. Bradford
(personal communication) supplied the further
information that the finding of polycystic kidneys in
the grandfather was reputedly documented at
necropsy, according to the verbal report from the
child's parents; also, as far as he knew, the mother of
the index case had not had an intravenous pyelo￾gram, although this had been suggested.
Van der Schoot (1955) described a family in
which three sisters had hepatosplenomegaly at an
early age. One sister died at 12 following haemate￾mesis, the other two had early splenectomies and
many years later were both found to have hepatic
cirrhosis and cystic kidneys. It is possible that
this is another example of the juvenile group but no
further conclusion can be drawn in the absence of
histological illustrations.
5. A Possible Group Milder than the Juve￾nile. A few families are recorded in which the
affected members appear to have a disease similar to
the Childhood type but of later onset and/or slower
progression. Examples are to be found amongst
the patients described by Clermont et al (1967), of
which one certainly and another possibly had
affected sibs, and the family described by Lorimer,
McGee, and McAlpine (1967), in which 4 sibs had
hepatic fibrosis (though there is no mention of
cystic kidneys in any of them).
Of the reported families with more than one
affected child, it appears therefore that in general
there is agreement with the premise that only one
group is represented within any given family. In
one or two families-for example those of Aurich
(1967) and Becker et al (1969)-the varying sur￾vival-times of the infants might suggest that both
the perinatal and neonatal groups were represented.
However, in the neonatal group the age at death
can vary considerably within a given family due to
infection, as demonstrated in family 9 of the present
series. Examination of the renal sections (of all
sibs) would be the only way to resolve this doubt.
One finding common to the published families and
the present series is the lack of parental consangu￾inity, though Heggo and Natvig commented that
the ancestors in their three families all came from
the same district of western Norway. Such rare
recessive disorders are usually associated with a
raised incidence of parental consanguinity, but
failure to demonstrate such an association may
merely reflect the present low consanguinity rate in
the population.
Conclusions
In children there is a characteristic pattern of
cystic malformation of the renal tubules which is
invariably associated with an equally characteristic
malformation of the intrahepatic biliary tree, ac￾companied by periportal fibrosis. This 'Child￾hood type of polycystic disease of kidneys and liver'
exists in at least 4 different forms, the essential
variable being the degree of renal involvement. The
most severe form-perinatal-in which about 90%
or more of the renal tubules are involved corres￾ponds with the severe form already established as an
entity, variously called group I (Lundin and Olow,
1961), type I (Osathanondh and Potter, 1964a and
b), and 'Potter's so called hamartomatous variety of

cystic kidney disease' (Heggo and Natvig, 1965a
and b). Infants in this group present at birth and
most die in the perinatal period: none of those in
the current series survived to 6 weeks. They
therefore present mainly as maternity unit pro￾blems: their representation in the current series is
largely-though not wholly-due to the inclusion of
genetic clinic families. In the mildest of the 4
groups-juvenile-10% or less of the renal tubules
are involved, and these children present with hepa￾tic enlargement and the effects of increasing portal
fibrosis. Between the two extremes it is suggested
that there are two intermediate groups: neonatal, in
which about 60% of renal tubules are involved;
and infantile, with about 25% of the renal tubules
involved. The term 'congenital hepatic fibrosis'-
when accompanied by the bizarre pattern of intrahe￾patic biliary ectasia characteristic of the Childhood
type of disease is thus applicable to all 4 groups, and
is then invariably associated with some degree of
renal cystic malformation.
In each group, sibs of the index patients may be
affected but no one else in the family is at risk.
Support for the suggested grouping is found in the
family evidence, only one group being represented
within any given family so far as can be judged.
Segregation analysis shows that the proportion of
sibs affected in each group is compatible with auto￾somal recessive inheritance, though the numbers are
too small for tests of significance. For the future,
further studies are particularly needed of families in
the two intermediate groups, neonatal and infan￾tile, with assessment of each affected child on the
lines suggested.
The pathological findings in young children af￾fected by the Adult (dominantly-inherited) type of
polycystic disease are quite distinct from those of
the Childhood type. The main histological dif￾ferences between the two types are given in Table
XI.
Finally, when counselling parents of a child with
cystic kidneys of obscure aetiology, histological
examination of the liver will often be of great help in
deciding whether or not the Childhood type of poly￾cystic disease is involved.
Summary
A combined clinico-pathological and genetic study
was based on patients admitted to The Hospital for
Sick Children, London, and families referred to the
genetic counselling clinic at the same hospital. The
criterion used in defining the index patients was a
pattern of specific renal and hepatic malformations,
later called the 'Childhood type of polycystic
disease of kidneys and liver'. This pattern was
found in 25 patients from 20 families. On clinico￾pathological criteria, these patients fell into 4 groups,
named according to the age at presentation,
Perinatal, Neonatal, Infantile, and Juvenile. The
family evidence supported this grouping. Auto￾somal recessive inheritance was indicated for each
group, a different mutant gene probably being in￾volved in each.
In a further 4 patients from 4 families, the pattern
of malformation was superficially similar but seen to
differ in detail. Autosomal dominant inheritance,
apparent in 2 of the families, supported the inter￾pretation that these 4 patients represent the Adult
type of polycystic disease of kidneys and liver pre￾senting in childhood.
A comparison is drawn between the pathological
features of the Childhood and Adult types of poly￾cystic disease as seen in the children in this series.
The authors would have liked to name individually all
colleagues who have helped in this study, but regret that
the list is unacceptably long.
They express their thanks first to Dr C. 0. Carter, who
suggested the need for this enquiry, for his generous
advice and encouragement throughout the work; also to
many members of the consultant staff of The Hospital for
Sick Children, Great Ormond Street for permission to
visit their patients' families and quote freely from the
case notes.
They are also most grateful to many colleagues in other
hospitals-the pathologists for necropsy reports and
histological material, and the paediatricians for informa￾tion about their patients-and to the family doctors for
permission to visit, and help in approaching the families
in their care.
They are much indebted to Professor A. E. Claireaux,
Drs D. G. Cottom and A. P. Norman, and Mr D. Innes
Williams for reading the script and offering much help￾ful criticism.
They also thank Mr R. J. Lunnon and the staff of the
Department of Medical Illustration, and Mr L. G.
Spain and the technical staff ofthe DepartmentofMorbid
Anatomy at The Hospital for Sick Children; Miss Pamela
Heath for help with the homevisits;andMrL. T. Morton,
librarian, National Institute for Medical Research, for
assistance with the literature.
