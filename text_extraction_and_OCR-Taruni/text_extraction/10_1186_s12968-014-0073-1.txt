Abstract
Background: We sought to identify cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters associated with
successful univentricular to biventricular conversion in patients with small left hearts.
Methods: Patients with small left heart structures and a univentricular circulation who underwent CMR prior to
biventricular conversion were retrospectively identified and divided into 2 anatomic groups: 1) borderline
hypoplastic left heart structures (BHLHS), and 2) right-dominant atrioventricular canal (RDAVC). The primary outcome
variable was transplant-free survival with a biventricular circulation.
Results: In the BHLHS group (n = 22), 16 patients (73%) survived with a biventricular circulation over a median
follow-up of 40 months (4–84). Survival was associated with a larger CMR left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume
(EDV) (p = 0.001), higher LV-to-right ventricle (RV) stroke volume ratio (p < 0.001), and higher mitral-to-tricuspid
inflow ratio (p = 0.04). For predicting biventricular survival, the addition of CMR threshold values to echocardiographic
LV EDV improved sensitivity from 75% to 93% while maintaining specificity at 100%. In the RDAVC group (n = 10), 9
patients (90%) survived with a biventricular circulation over a median follow-up of 29 months (3–51). The minimum
CMR values were a LV EDV of 22 ml/m2 and a LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio of 0.19.
Conclusions: In BHLHS patients, a larger LV EDV, LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio, and mitral-to-tricuspid inflow ratio were
associated with successful biventricular conversion. The addition of CMR parameters to echocardiographic measurements
improved the sensitivity for predicting successful conversion. In RDAVC patients, the high success rate precluded
discriminant analysis, but a range of CMR parameters permitting biventricular conversion were identified.

Background
Children born with cardiac malformations can have a
range of left ventricular underdevelopment. At one end
of the spectrum, patients may have severe ventricular
hypoplasia and/or valve atresia rendering a biventricular
circulation with the pulmonary and systemic ventricles
in series impossible. At the other end are mild degrees of
valve stenosis and/or ventricular hypoplasia that are com￾patible with a biventricular circulation. Between these ex￾tremes are patients in whom the decision whether to
pursue univentricular palliation or biventricular repair is
both challenging and risky.
This clinical dilemma most commonly arises in the con￾text of 2 anatomic diagnoses: 1) patients who have various
combinations of left-sided valvar hypoplasia and stenosis
(mitral and/or aortic), left ventricular (LV) hypoplasia, and
aortic coarctation (borderline hypoplastic left heart

structures, BHLHS); and 2) those who have right-dominant
atrioventricular canal defects (RDAVC) with variable de￾grees of right ventricular (RV) dominance, abnormalities of
the left ventricular papillary muscle and chordal architec￾ture, and left ventricular hypoplasia. In both situations, the
decision whether to proceed with a biventricular circulation
management strategy has profound implications. Pursuit of
univentricular palliation commits a patient to the lifelong
consequences of a Fontan circulation with its associated
risks of mortality, ventricular and valvar dysfunction, heart
failure, arrhythmia, protein losing enteropathy, and liver
dysfunction [1-5]. However, inappropriate pursuit of a
biventricular repair carries with it the threat of periopera￾tive mortality, LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, valvar
dysfunction requiring frequent repairs or replacement, and
pulmonary hypertension [6].
Despite the important ramifications of the decision to
pursue a univentricular versus biventricular circulation,
current management algorithms, which rely on echocar￾diographic data, are too often incorrect [6-12]. Cardiovas￾cular magnetic resonance (CMR) with its tomographic
approach to ventricular measurements, ability to quantify
flow across vessels and valves, and capacity to identify late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) consistent with endocar￾dial fibroelastosis (EFE) [13], has emerged as a potentially
important tool in the preoperative assessment of this
population. Therefore, we sought to identify CMR param￾eters associated with successful conversion from a univen￾tricular to biventricular circulation.
Methods
Subjects
A retrospective database review of all patients undergoing
CMR at Boston Children’s Hospital from January 2005
through July 2012 was conducted. Subjects were included
if they had the following: 1) BHLHS or RDAVC, 2) no
conotruncal abnormalities (e.g., L-loop transposition), 3) a
univentricular circulation at the time of CMR followed by
either surgical or catheter intervention to establish a
biventricular circulation, 4) ventricular volumetric data
measured at CMR, and 5) follow-up information available
for ≥3 months after the intervention for survivors of
biventricular conversion. BHLHS patients were defined as
those with hypoplastic (z-score < −2) or obstructed left
heart structures during their treatment course in whom
there was uncertainty regarding ability to support a biven￾tricular circulation. RDAVC patients were those with
endocardial cushion defects with LV hypoplasia and/or
more than 50% of the common atrioventricular valve re￾lated to the RV. Patient demographics, clinical history,
echocardiography and CMR data, and surgical details were
abstracted from the medical record. The Committee on
Clinical Investigation at Boston Children’s Hospital ap￾proved this study.
Our institutional approach to patients with BHLHS
takes into account multiple patient-specific anatomic and
physiologic factors, as well as parent and healthcare pro￾vider preferences, and has evolved over time [14]. More￾over, the varied age at referral and prior surgical history
impose some heterogeneity in management. In general,
left heart structure growth may be promoted by increasing
left heart blood flow at the time of a bidirectional Glenn
shunt by including a Blalock-Taussig shunt or right
ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit and/or atrial septal
restriction. Mitral valvuloplasty and LV EFE resection are
employed but typically not in the neonatal period. Surgical
or catheter aortic valvuloplasty are performed at any time.
Fetuses diagnosed with evolving hypoplastic left heart syn￾drome may undergo in utero balloon aortic valvuloplasty
[15]. The decision whether to attempt a biventricular con￾version procedure was at the discretion of each patient’s
physicians who took clinical status, echocardiography,
catheterization, and CMR data into consideration.
CMR
CMR was performed on a 1.5 T scanner (Philips Achieva,
Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). All stud￾ies were performed under general anesthesia. A typical im￾aging protocol consisted of 1) cine steady-state free
precession imaging in an axial plane, ventricular long- and
short-axis planes, and aortic arch long-axis plane; 2)
gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiogram; 3)
phase velocity flow measurements in the native and neo￾aortic roots, descending aorta, branch pulmonary arteries,
pulmonary veins, atrioventricular valves, and superior and
inferior vena cavae; and 4) LGE imaging in ventricular
long- and short-axis planes 10–20 minutes after the ad￾ministration of contrast.
Ventricular and flow volumes were calculated using
commercially available software (QMass and QFlow,
MEDIS Medical Imaging Systems, the Netherlands) as
previously described [16,17]. In RDAVC patients, ventricu￾lar volumes were measured by extrapolating the plane of
the septum to the base of the heart. EFE was defined as
LGE of the endocardial wall of the LV and papillary mus￾cles in a pattern not following a coronary distribution [13].
Echocardiography
Echocardiograms were performed using standard imaging
protocols [18-20]. LV volumes were calculated using the
following formula: 5/6 * short-axis area * long-axis length
[19,20]. To ensure consistency in the study, ventricular
measurements as well as mitral and aortic valve dimen￾sions were re-measured by a single observer.
Statistics
Descriptive statistics are shown as median (range) or
mean ± standard deviation. The associations between

predictor and outcome variables were evaluated using the
Mann–Whitney U test and the Fisher’s exact test. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed
for candidate variables to identify discrimination thresh￾olds associated with the primary outcome — transplant￾free survival with a biventricular circulation. ROC curves
were compared using the approach described by Hanley
et al. [21]. Transplant-free survival between patient groups
was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Echocardio￾graphic and CMR measurements were compared using
Spearman rank correlation and a Bland-Altman analysis of
agreement. Results were considered statistically significant
if p ≤ 0.05. Statistical calculations were performed using
SPSS versions 18 and 21 (IBM Corporation, USA).
Results
During the study period, 32 patients (22 with BHLHS
and 10 with RDAVC) with a univentricular circulation
met the inclusion criteria and underwent CMR prior to
a biventricular conversion procedure. An additional 32 pa￾tients (31 with BHLHS and 1 with RDAVC) underwent at￾tempts at left ventricular recruitment during the study
period but were excluded because they did not undergo
biventricular conversion during the study period. Further￾more, 10 patients (2 with BHLHS and 8 with RDAVC)
were excluded because they did not undergo a CMR
examination prior to biventricular conversion. Referral for
CMR was at the clinical team’s discretion.
Borderline hypoplastic left heart structures group
Clinical data
Demographic, clinical history, CMR, echocardiographic,
and catheterization parameters for the BHLHS group
(n = 22) are summarized in Table 1. Seventeen patients
(77%) underwent a prior procedure designed to increase
blood flow into the LV by providing an additional source
of pulmonary blood flow (e.g., Blalock-Taussig shunt in a
patient with a bidirectional Glenn shunt), and/or by
restricting the atrial septal defect to direct more of the
pulmonary venous return into the LV. The median time
between echocardiogram and CMR was 1 day (0–89), and
between catheterization and CMR was 0 days (0–90). The
median time between the CMR examination and the
attempted biventricular conversion was 3 days (0–198).
Outcomes
Univentricular to biventricular conversion was attempted
surgically in 20 patients (91%) and by catheter balloon
dilation of the aortic valve in 2 (9%). Of the 22 patients, 6
(27%) failed the biventricular conversion procedure. Three
of the failures occurred prior to discharge: 1 died in the
hospital after a 5 month post-operative course with mul￾tiple surgical and catheter interventions, 1 underwent
heart transplant 6 months after conversion, and 1 had an
attempted balloon aortic valvuloplasty for establishment
of biventricular circulation but LV function did not re￾cover and he underwent a stage 1 palliation 4 days later.
In addition, there were 3 late failures. One patient with a
good early hemodynamic result died at home of unknown
causes 2 months after conversion. A second patient had LV
diastolic dysfunction and RV hypertension after conversion,

and died of a respiratory illness 15 months later. A third pa￾tient developed severe pulmonary hypertension and pul￾monary vein stenosis, requiring takedown to a stage 1
Norwood procedure 3 months after conversion. The 16
transplant-free biventricular survivors had a median follow￾up time after the biventricular conversion procedure of
40 months (4–84). During this time, 6 of these patients
underwent mitral valve replacement and 3 had aortic valve
replacement. Among the 13 subjects with RV systolic pres￾sure data available, 5 had pressure greater than one-half
systemic pressure and 8 had pressure less than one-half sys￾temic pressure but greater than 25 mm Hg.
Parameters associated with transplant-free biventricular
circulation survival
Table 2 compares patients who survived to latest follow￾up with a transplant-free biventricular circulation to
those who did not. Survivors of biventricular conversion
were significantly older at the time of CMR and were
more likely to have undergone a prior procedure to in￾crease LV flow. They also had a significantly larger indexed
CMR LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) (Figure 1A), a
higher LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio (Figure 2A), and a
higher mitral-to-tricuspid valve (MV-to-TV) inflow ratio
(Figure 3A). A LGE pattern consistent with EFE was not
associated with outcome, but 15 patients (68%) underwent
EFE resection at some point in their treatment course,
confounding interpretation of the significance of EFE.
Based on echocardiography, survivors had a larger LV
EDV (Figure 4A) and LV stroke volume. Mitral and aortic
valve annulus diameter z-scores were similar between the
groups. Left atrial and ventricular end-diastolic pressures
at catheterization were also not significantly different be￾tween the groups.
ROC analysis identified CMR and echocardiographic pa￾rameters and threshold values that best predicted survival

with a transplant-free, biventricular circulation (Table 3).
The area under the curve (AUC) for echocardiographic
LV EDV did not differ significantly from that of CMR LV
EDV (p = 0.15), CMR LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio
(p = 0.09), or CMR MV-to-TV inflow ratio (p = 0.5). Using
survival analysis to incorporate time to failure, these
threshold values were all associated with significant differ￾ences in freedom from failure (Figures 1B and C, 2B
and C, 3B and C, and 4B).
The small sample size precluded multivariable ana￾lysis. However, data for all 4 threshold values (CMR-de￾rived LV EDV ≥ 45 ml/m2
, LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio ≥
0.7, MV-to-TV inflow ratio ≥ 0.9, and echocardiography￾derived LV EDV ≥ 45 ml/m2
) were available for 19 patients.
Among these, all 14 patients who met at least 2 of the 4
threshold values survived to follow-up with a biventricular
circulation, compared to 1 of 5 patients who met only 0 or
1 of these 4 criteria (p = 0.001). This combination of 4
thresholds yielded a sensitivity of 93% with a specificity of
100%, compared to echocardiography-derived LV EDV ≥
45 ml/m2 alone, which had a sensitivity of 75% and a speci￾ficity of 100%.
Comparison between echocardiography and CMR
measurements
Echocardiography and CMR derived LV EDV measure￾ments were closely correlated (r = 0.81, p < 0.001; Figure 5A)
but had only fair agreement, with CMR values being larger
(mean difference 3.2 ± 10.5 ml/m2
; Figure 5B). Similarly,
echocardiography and CMR derived LV ejection fraction
measurements also correlated (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) but had
only fair agreement, with CMR values being greater (mean
difference 2.9 ± 8.0%).

time between echocardiogram and CMR examination was
0 days (0–8), and between catheterization and CMR
examination was 0 days (0–90). The median time between
the CMR examination and the attempted biventricular
conversion was 2.5 days (0–22).
Outcomes
All patients survived the biventricular conversion proced￾ure and had a biventricular circulation at the time of hos￾pital discharge. Over a median post-conversion follow-up
period of 28 months (3–51), 1 patient with recurrent mi￾tral stenosis and LV outflow tract obstruction died at
home from a respiratory illness 12 months after conver￾sion. Among the survivors, 1 patient required mitral valve
replacement and none required aortic valve replacement.
No patients had RV systolic pressure greater than one-half
systemic pressure, 8 were less than one-half systemic but
greater than 25 mm Hg, and 1 was less than 25 mm Hg.
The small sample size precluded an analysis of the param￾eters associated with a transplant-free biventricular circu￾lation. Successful biventricular conversions were seen in
patients with an LV EDV as low as 22 ml/m2 and a LV-to￾RV stroke volume ratio as low as 0.19.
Comparison between echocardiography and CMR
measurements
Echocardiography and CMR derived LV EDV had modest
correlation (r = 0.67, p = 0.03; Figure 6A) and only fair
agreement, with CMR values being larger (mean difference
10.3 ± 5.0 ml/m2
; Figure 6B). Echocardiography and CMR
derived LV ejection fraction measurements were not sig￾nificantly correlated (r = −0.44, p = 0.21) and showed poor
agreement, with higher ejection fraction by CMR com￾pared to echocardiography (mean difference 14.3 ± 15.0%).
Discussion
This study is the first to report CMR findings predictive
of a successful conversion from univentricular to biven￾tricular circulation in patients with left heart hypoplasia.
We found that a greater LV EDV, LV-to-RV stroke vol￾ume ratio, and MV-to-TV inflow ratio were associated
with a higher rate of survival with a biventricular circu￾lation in patients with BHLHS. We were also able to
identify threshold values for these parameters that were
associated with successful biventricular conversion.
These data will facilitate interpretation of CMR mea￾surements in patients with BHLHS being considered for

biventricular conversion and assist with risk stratifica￾tion. The high success rate for biventricular conversion
in the RDAVC patient group precluded identification of
predictor parameters. Nevertheless, our data provide
new information on the range of CMR-derived ventricu￾lar parameters in RDAVC that are compatible with
biventricular conversion.
Grosse-Wortmann et al. previously demonstrated the
feasibility of CMR in a cohort of 20 consecutive neo￾nates with left heart hypoplasia [22]. However, because
the number of patients in their study who underwent
biventricular repair was small (n = 16) and only 1 patient
did not survive a biventricular management strategy,
they were unable to assess for factors associated with
successful biventricular repair. Our study was not re￾stricted to neonates and many patients had undergone
prior interventions to increase blood flow through the
LV with the aim of promoting a biventricular repair [14].
Therefore, it may assist with risk stratification not only
for neonates with BHLHS who are being considered for
biventricular conversion, but also for older patients who
have undergone previous univentricular palliation or LV
recruitment maneuvers.
The factors we identified as predicting a higher likeli￾hood of successful biventricular conversion – larger LV
EDV, LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio, and MV-to-TV in￾flow ratio are inter-related and plausible from a physio￾logic standpoint. It is not surprising that a larger LV that
is supporting a greater proportion of the cardiac output is
more likely to sustain a full cardiac output at the time of
biventricular conversion. Moreover, ventricles that are lar￾ger may have greater compliance allowing ventricular

filling at physiologically acceptable pressures, which is
often a limiting factor in this patient population. Similarly,
a mitral valve that can accommodate greater inflow should
be more likely to tolerate a complete cardiac input at the
time of biventricular conversion. These factors are also
consistent with a prior publication from our institution
that found that degree of atrial septal restriction was associ￾ated with outcome [14] as it is likely that greater restriction
results in more mitral inflow (and a higher MV-to-TV ra￾tio), a larger LV EDV, and potentially a higher LV-to-RV
stroke volume ratio.
Comparison of CMR and echocardiography measurements
We found good correlation between CMR and echocar￾diography for LV volumes and ejection fraction in the
BHLHS group, and to a lesser extent for LV volumes in
the RDAVC group. There was not a significant correl￾ation for LV ejection fraction in the RDAVC group.
However, despite the good correlations between modal￾ities in the BHLHS group, the limits of agreement were
relatively wide, which indicates that substantial differ￾ences in measurements beyond a systematic bias are
present. Small chamber size, abnormal chamber geom￾etry related to LV compression by the dilated RV, and
abnormal papillary muscle architecture may contribute
to differences between modalities. The impact of these
confounders is likely more pronounced in patients with
RDAVC, explaining the poorer correlations between
echocardiography and CMR in this group.
In contrast to our study, Grosse-Wortmann et al., found
poor correlation between measurements of ventricular
volume and function between the two modalities even for
the LV [22]. Their study used the monoplane Simpson’s
method for calculating LV volumes by echocardiography,
rather than the 5/6 * area * length method used in ours.
Moreover, they analyzed patients with and without an
atrioventricular canal defect together whereas we analyzed
the two lesions separately.

Utility of CMR
Although several studies have identified echocardiographic
parameters to predict successful biventricular conversion
in both BHLHS [12,23-25] and RDAVC [26-29],
decision-making remains challenging. In a multicenter,
retrospective evaluation of 362 neonates with critical left
ventricular outflow obstruction, Hickey et al. found that
inappropriate pursuit of biventricular repair in patients
with borderline left heart structures was common and re￾sulted in poor long-term survival compared to that pre￾dicted with single ventricle palliation [6]. Similarly, in a
retrospective study of 45 patients with RVDAVC from a
single institution, Szwast et al. found that 18% of patients
who underwent biventricular repair did not survive to
follow-up [26]. These suboptimal results utilizing echocar￾diography led us to investigate the utility of CMR-derived
parameters for decisions regarding biventricular repair.
Although we identified 3 CMR parameters that were
associated with biventricular survival in the BHLHS
group, the individual AUCs for these were not signifi￾cantly different from that of LV EDV by echocardiog￾raphy. However, since no single parameter is a perfect
predictor, the use of several parameters, some based on
ventricular volume and others on flow data, may result
in better risk stratification. In our study, the small sam￾ple size precluded multivariable analysis. However, using
a combination of 4 thresholds, including CMR parame￾ters, improved sensitivity compared to a single echocar￾diographic threshold, thereby highlighting the potential
additive value of CMR. Furthermore, CMR can provide
information regarding the presence and distribution of
LGE when EFE resection is being considered.
In patients with RDAVC, the small number of patients in
our cohort and favorable outcomes precluded discriminant
analysis. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that successful
biventricular conversions were seen in patients with a LV
EDV as low as 22 ml/m2 and a LV-to-RV stroke volume ra￾tios as low as 0.19. As more patients with RDAVC undergo
CMR and biventricular conversion, predictive threshold
values for LV EDV will likely emerge. Given the poor correl￾ation and agreement between CMR and echocardiographic
measurements of LV EDV, CMR-derived values may prove
to be more powerful. This information is particularly im￾portant for managing patients who are at increased risk with
a univentricular palliation, such as those with trisomy 21 or
with elevated pulmonary artery pressure.
Limitations
Our study has a relatively small sample size as BHLHS and
RDAVC cases are rare. Moreover, there is a potential selec￾tion bias because not all patients at our institution were re￾ferred for CMR prior to a univentricular to biventricular
conversion procedure. Our study design also excluded pa￾tients who underwent CMR but did not undergo a
biventricular conversion, perhaps based on the CMR data
itself. All of these factors could have potentially decreased
the power of the study to identify CMR parameters associ￾ated with successful biventricular conversion. Nevertheless,
we were able to identify 3 parameters strongly associated
with outcome. One of these parameters, the MV-to-TV ra￾tio, utilizes phase contrast measurements of atrioventricular
valve blood inflow. The accuracy of these measurements
may be limited by the through-plane motion of the valves
relative to the fixed imaging plane [30]. However, this error
is at least partially mitigated in our study by the use of the
ratio of atrioventricular valve flow as both valves move in
the same direction. Several studies have identified the pres￾ence of extensive EFE as a risk factor for unsuccessful
biventricular repair [24,31,32]. In our study, the high rate of
EFE resection confounded the interpretation of EFE data.
Finally, this study was not designed to evaluate the long￾term outcome of a biventricular repair in these patients; it
is possible that with longer follow-up additional biventricu￾lar patients will undergo heart transplantation, takedown to
a univentricular circulation, or death.
Conclusions
This study provides novel data on CMR parameters pre￾dictive of successful conversion from univentricular to
biventricular circulation in patients with left heart hypo￾plasia. Greater CMR LV EDV, LV-to-RV stroke volume
ratio, and MV-to-TV inflow ratio were associated with a
higher rate of survival with a biventricular circulation in
patients with BHLHS. The addition of CMR parameters
to echocardiographic measurements improved the sensi￾tivity for predicting successful conversion. Successful
biventricular conversions were seen in RDAVC patients
with LV EDV as low as 22 ml/m2 and LV-to-RV stroke
volume ratios as low as 0.19. More studies are needed in
this difficult patient group to further refine risk stratifi￾cation and improve patient management.
