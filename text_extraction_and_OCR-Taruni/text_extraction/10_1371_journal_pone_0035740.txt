Abstract
Normal tissue toxicity still remains a dose-limiting factor in clinical radiation therapy. Recently, plasminogen activator
inhibitor type 1 (SERPINE1/PAI-1) was reported as an essential mediator of late radiation-induced intestinal injury. However,
it is not clear whether PAI-1 plays a role in acute radiation-induced intestinal damage and we hypothesized that PAI-1 may
play a role in the endothelium radiosensitivity. In vivo, in a model of radiation enteropathy in PAI-1 2/2 mice, apoptosis of
radiosensitive compartments, epithelial and microvascular endothelium was quantified. In vitro, the role of PAI-1 in the
radiation-induced endothelial cells (ECs) death was investigated. The level of apoptotic ECs is lower in PAI-1 2/2 compared
with Wt mice after irradiation. This is associated with a conserved microvascular density and consequently with a better
mucosal integrity in PAI-1 2/2 mice. In vitro, irradiation rapidly stimulates PAI-1 expression in ECs and radiation sensitivity is
increased in ECs that stably overexpress PAI-1, whereas PAI-1 knockdown increases EC survival after irradiation. Moreover,
ECs prepared from PAI-1 2/2 mice are more resistant to radiation-induced cell death than Wt ECs and this is associated
with activation of the Akt pathway. This study demonstrates that PAI-1 plays a key role in radiation-induced EC death in the
intestine and suggests that this contributes strongly to the progression of radiation-induced intestinal injury.

Introduction
Radiation therapy is crucial in the therapeutic arsenal used for
more than half of cancer patients. However, normal tissue side
effects associated with this treatment limit the effective radiation
dose than can be delivered to the tumor [1,2]. Most patients
treated with ionizing radiation will develop acute complications
and 5 to 10% chronic late damage such as fibrosis. Initiation and
progression of radiation-induced injury involves different mecha￾nisms such as the coagulation system activation, DNA repair, cell
death, inflammation, endothelium activation, angiogenesis and
matrix remodeling [3].
The plasminogen activator (PA) system, which controls the
formation and activity of plasmin, plays a key role in vascular
homeostasis. PAI-1 (or standard gene symbol SERPINE1) belongs
to the family of serine protease inhibitors and is the primary
physiologic inhibitor of plasminogen activators in vivo [4]. Both
plasminogen activators (u-PA and t-PA) convert plasminogen to
plasmin, which degrades insoluble fibrin. PAI-1 inhibits u-PA and
t-PA and thus reduces plasmin generation. PAI-1 is not only an
antifibrinolytic molecule, but also plays a role in extracellular
matrix remodeling by reducing plasmin-dependent matrix metal￾loproteinase (MMP) activation. The role of PAI-1 in fibrosis has
been widely studied and it has been shown that PAI-1 is
upregulated in several fibrotic diseases [5–8].
Radiation-induced endothelial injury has been described as a
crucial event in initiation of normal tissue damage [1]. Radiation￾induced activation of endothelial cells (ECs) is associated with a
pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic and antifibrinolytic phenotype
[9]. Precise regulation of the fibrinolytic system determines
vascular homeostasis, but also physiological processes such as
wound healing. In vitro radiation increases PAI-1 expression in
cancer [10,11] and normal cells [12–14]. Moreover, PAI-1
overexpression has been described in radiation-induced nephro￾sclerosis in rats [15,16] and in human radiation enteritis [17]. Our
group and others have described upregulation of PAI-1 in ECs in
vitro and in vivo after irradiation [12,18,19], and radiation-induced
intestinal damage in patients treated with radiotherapy is
associated with upregulation of PAI-1 in the endothelium [12].
Recently, PAI-1 was demonstrated as playing a crucial role in
radiation-induced intestinal fibrosis. In a model of radiation￾induced enteropathy in mice, PAI-1 knockout mice are protected
against intestinal radiation-induced injury with increased survival
and better intestinal function compared with wild-type (Wt) mice
[12]. However, the role of PAI-1 in radiation-induced acute side
effects is still unclear. As described in our previous study, 40 to
45% of Wt mice died within 10 days after localized irradiation at
19 Gy, whereas no PAI-1 knockout mice died. The two survival
curves separate within two days after irradiation, suggesting a

contribution of PAI-1 in early events occurring after radiation
exposure. Among acute effects observed in normal tissue response
to high-dose radiation, depletion of microvascular and stem cell
compartments is clearly determinant [20,21]. Most studies show
that gastrointestinal syndrome following total-body irradiation in
mice is in part due to a destruction and sterilization of
radiosensitive compartments such as stem/clonogenic epithelial
cells and microvascular endothelium. PAI-1 has been described as
playing either pro- or anti-apoptotic roles [22–24]. PAI-1 has an
anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic action in the central nervous
system [25], and is pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic in vascular
tumor cells [26] and vascular smooth muscle cells [27,28].
Paradoxically, primary ECs isolated from aortas of PAI-1 2/2
mice are protected from wortmannin-induced apoptosis and have
enhanced rates of proliferation [29,30].
Here we hypothesized that PAI-1 may influence EC radiosen￾sitivity and the aim of this work was to explore the effects of
genetic deficiency on radiation-induced cell death of radiation￾sensitive compartments of the intestine. We report a critical role of
PAI-1 in radiation-induced microvascular EC apoptosis.
Materials and Methods
Mice and irradiation procedures
Experiments were performed on Wt C57BL/6J (PAI-1 +/+)
and PAI-1 2/2 mice (Charles River Laboratories) in compliance
with legal regulations in France for animal experimentations. In
total, 160 animals (10–12 weeks old) were included in this study.
Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the
ethics committee of the Institute for Radiological Protection and
Nuclear Safety (number T23, 05–09). Radiation-induced enter￾opathy was produced by exposure of a localized intestinal portion
to a single ionizing radiation dose as previously described [12].
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and, after
laparotomy, a 3-cm long intestinal segment (10 cm from the
ileocecal valve) was exteriorized and exposed to a single dose of 19
Gy gamma irradiation (Co60 source, dose rate 1.2 Gy/min). Sham
irradiation was performed by maintaining the intestinal segment
exteriorized without radiation exposure. After radiation exposure
or sham-irradiation, the exposed segment was returned to the
abdominal cavity and peritoneum/abdominal muscles and skin
were separately closed with interrupted sutures.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
To perform global analyses of the irradiated tissues, histology
and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed on different
groups of animals. For routine histology analysis, intestines were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin.
Longitudinal sections (5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin￾saffron. Radiation injury was determined in a blinded manner
independently by two authors using a described and validated
radiation injury scoring system [12]. For immunohistochemistry
experiments, intestinal tissues were embedded with Tissue-Tek
OCT mounting media and frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid
nitrogen. CD31/TUNEL and E-Cadherin/TUNEL double
staining was performed on 5 mm frozen sections after fixation
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. For CD31 immuno￾staining, sections were permeabilized with a PBS-0.1% Triton￾0.1% sodium citrate solution for 2 minutes at 4uC and nonspecific
sites were blocked in 3% Normal Goat Serum (Dako) diluted in
PBS. Sections were then incubated with anti-CD31 antibody
(clone 390, Abcam) 1:50e for 1 hour at room temperature. For E￾cadherin immunostaining, sections were incubated in PBS-1%
BSA-0.2% nonfat milk-0.3% Triton for 10 minutes and were
incubated with anti-E-cadherin antibody (rat monoclonal ECCD￾2, Zymed) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 hour at room temperature.
Negative controls were not exposed to primary antibodies. All
samples were incubated with an Alexa fluor 568-conjugated goat
anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes) 1:200 for 1 hour. The first
immunostaining was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 minutes. TUNEL staining was performed using the In situ Cell
Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The ECs and apoptotic cells were
counted in the lamina propria of 60 to 70 villi (full longitudinal
sections of complete villi) from seven or eight different animals for
each group. The apoptotic epithelial cells were counted in about
100 to 150 crypt sections per sample from the same animals.
Analyses of intestinal vascular density were performed after
CD31/Sytox Green staining of 20 mm frozen sections. After
fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with
TBS-0.15% Triton, sections were incubated with anti-CD31
antibody for 2 hours followed by incubation with Alexa fluor 568-
conjugated goat anti-rat antibody. Nuclei were counterstained
with Sytox Green (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Confocal analyses were performed on a Bio-Rad
MRC 1024 ES confocal imaging system. Z-stack images were
collected at 1 mm steps. Images were imported and analyzed with
Histolab software. Red fluorescence was automatically detected
and its area was related to the villus area.
Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription and real-time
PCR
Total RNA was prepared with the total RNA isolation kit
(Rneasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA integrity
was analyzed using Agilent 2100 and after quantification on a
NanoDrop ND-1000 apparatus (NanoDrop Technologies, Rock￾land DE), reverse transcription was performed using the High
Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pre-developed TaqManH
Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) were used and PCR
was performed with the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems). PCR fluorescent signals were
normalized to a PCR fluorescent signal obtained from the
housekeeping gene GAPDH (for in vitro experiments) or 18S
(for in vivo experiments). Relative mRNA quantification was
performed by using the comparative DDCT method.
Cell culture and irradiation
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
obtained from Lonza and cultured in EGM-2 MV culture
medium (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were used between passages 3 and 6 and were irradiated with
a 137Cesium source. Levels of living cells after irradiation were
determined by counting viable cells using a hemocytometer and
the trypan blue exclusion method.
Murine endothelial cells: preparation and
characterization
Murine primary aortic ECs were isolated from Wt and PAI-1
2/2 mice. Wt and PAI-12/2 mice (six mice/preparation) were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine
(100 mg.kg21
) and xylazine (10 mg.kg21
). The rib cage was cut
and we identified the aortic arch, which is attached to the heart
and links the kidney and iliac branch point. The aortic tree was
then placed in PBS to remove debris and blood and transferred
into complete medium EBM2-MV (Lonza) at room temperature.
Aortas were cut into small sections (2 to 3 mm) and opened

longitudinally. Each segment was positioned lumen side down
onto culture dishes coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) and
placed in incubator at 37uC. After 3 days we observed some
outgrowth from the tissue and culture medium was changed every
3 days At each change, one part of the Matrigel was removed,
allowing the cells to adhere to the plastic. After twenty days, cells
were trypsinized and labeled with CD105-PE antibody (e￾biosciences d:1/25). Cells were sorted by flow cytometry using a
BD Facsvantage TM apparatus. Sorted CD105-positive cells were
directly recovered in complete medium. The purity of the EC
population was checked after labeling with CD105-PE and
CD106-FITC (e-biosciences) antibodies and flow cytometry
analyses. More than 92- 96% of cells passed were CD105- and
CD106-positive cells. Cells were routinely cultured in EBM2-MV
and purity of ECs was checked until 12 passages. Before
experiments using murine ECs from Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice,
analyses of phenotype were completed by immunohistochemistry
with CD105, CD106, CD31 and vWf labeling and mRNA
detection with real-time PCR of EC markers: FLt-1, KDR,FLt-4,
angiopoietin-1, angiopoeitin-2, Tie-2, VEGF-A, VEGF-B,
CD105, CD106, CD54/ICAM-1, u-PA, tPA, uPAR and PAI-1.
Tube formation assay
The ability of murine ECs to form capillary-like structures was
studied. Briefly, 12-well culture plates were pre-coated with 650 ml
of Matrigel. ECs obtained from Wt or PAI-1 2/2 mice were
plated at the same density and were irradiated 2 hours later at 10
or 20 Gy. 24 hours after irradiation, capillary like-structures were
quantified. For each individual point 8 images in different view￾fields were realized with size-calibrated fields of vision using a
standard microscope interfaced with Histolab software. In each
image branch points were counted and averaged.
Establishment of PAI-1-expressing stable cell lines
Construction of pCMV6-Neo-PAI-1 plasmid: pCMV6-Neo
plasmid and pCMV6-XL5-PAI-1 plasmid (both from Origene)
were digested with NotI (Promega). Digested pCMV6-Neo
plasmid was then dephosphorylated with TSAP (Promega).
pCMV6-Neo and pCMV6-XL5-PAI-1 digestion products were
each gel-purified (Promega Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up).
The 538 kb dephosphorylated and NotI-digested pCMV6-Neo
fragment was ligated with the 3.2 kb NotI-digested PAI-1
fragment using Quick T4 DNA Ligase (Biolabs). The reaction
mixtures were purified with the Geneclean III kit (QBiogene) and
transformed into chemocompetent E. coli strain XL10-Gold
(Stratagene). Transformation mixtures were spread on LB agar
plate with ampicillin and plasmid DNA was obtained from
minicultures (Promega Wizard Plus SV Minipreps). Transfor￾mants were screened by ApaLI digestion and one positive clone
was amplified by LB culture supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml
ampicillin. Pure plasmid was obtained using Qiagen Endofree
Plasmid Maxi Kit. pCMV6-Neo-PAI-1 plasmid DNA integrity
was checked by agarose gel analysis after ApaLI digestion and
confirmed by sequencing. HUVECs (passage 3) were transfected
with pCMV6-Neo-PAI-1 plasmid using the Amaxa nucleofection
method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
cultured for 7 days in complete medium supplemented with
100 mg/mL of G418 (Invitrogen). Clones were obtained after
three passages and culture complete medium supplemented with
50 mg/mL of G418. Overexpression of PAI-1 was confirmed by
western blot for each clone compared with control HUVECs used
at the same passage.
Clonogenic assays
The radiosensitivity of HUVECs overexpressing PAI-1 was
assayed by clonogenic assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well
culture plates (1000 cells/well) and, three hours after plating, were
irradiated at different doses (1, 2, 3 and 4 Gy). Twelve days after
irradiation, cells were fixed and stained with an absolute methanol
solution containing 0.25% crystal violet and 3% paraformalde￾hyde. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted and
the surviving fraction was calculated according to the following
formula: (Number of colony counts/Number of cells plated)6
(plating efficiency), where plating efficiency was defined as
(Number of colony counts)/(Number of cells plated for non￾irradiated controls). The surviving fraction at 2 Gy and survival
curves were generated for each clone and for control HUVECs by
combining data from two experiments with each experiment
performed in triplicate.
RNA interference
siRNA targeting PAI-1, PTEN or PDK-1 were from Dharma￾con (Thermo Scientific). Cells were transfected with 100 nM of
siRNA using Dharmafect as transfection reagent. Two days after
transfection, cells were lysed for RNA and protein extraction as
previously described. Knockdown efficiency was measured by real￾time PCR and/or western blot.
Western blotting
Total proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer supplemented
with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration
was determined using BCA assay (Sigma Aldrich) and equal
amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The following
protein-specific primary antibodies were used: anti-PAI-1 (Novo￾castra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle, UK), anti-GAPDH (Biode￾sign), anti phospho-Akt (ser473), anti-Akt, anti-Phospho PTEN
(ser380), anti-PTEN , anti Phospho-PDK-1 (ser241), anti BCL2,
anti-BCL-XL, anti phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), anti￾phospho Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-NF-kB p65 (Cell Signal￾ing Technology).
Statistical analyses
All data are presented as mean 6 SEM. For in vivo
experiments, differences between different groups were tested for
statistical significance using ANOVA. The 2-tailed Student’s t test
was used for all other experiments. A p value ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
PAI-1 genetic deficiency is associated with reduced acute
and late radiation-induced intestinal injury
In this study, we chose to use a model of localized irradiation of
an intestinal segment. In this model, mRNA levels of components
involved in the plasminogen activation system were determined by
real-time PCR. Initiation of radiation-induced enteropathy in
mice is associated with a strong upregulation of PAI-1 mRNA level
and a slight upregulation of uPAR (Figure S1), with no
modification of uPA and tPA. These results suggest that PAI-1 is
the most probably part of the plasminogen activation system
involved in radiation-induced enteropathy. Radiation injury
scoring revealed that PAI-1 2/2 mice are protected against
radiation damage in both the late and acute phases, confirming
previous results [12,31] (Figure 1A). Detailed analyses performed
at 3 and 14 days showed that differences in radiation injury
between Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice are strongly associated with
PAI-1 and Radiation-Induced Endothelial Cell Death

protection of the mucosae (Figure 1B–C). This was confirmed by
the quantification of mucosal integrity 3 days after irradiation,
showing that the length of the crypt/villus axis was reduced in Wt
but not in PAI-1 2/2 mice (Figure 1D).
PAI-1 genetic deficiency is associated with reduced
radiation-induced apoptosis in vivo
Radiation-induced apoptosis is a crucial event in the acute
effects of radiation. mRNA analyses determined in total intestinal
tissues showed that genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is not associated
with differences in mRNA levels of apoptosis/survival-related
genes such as Bax, Caspase3, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Survivin, AKT1 and
PTEN (Table S1). Moreover, irradiation increased Bax and Bcl￾XL mRNA levels and decreased survivin mRNA levels, but no
difference was observed between Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice (Figure
S2). Irradiation had no effect on mRNA levels of caspase3, Bcl2,
AKT1 and PTEN (Figure S2). These results obtained in total
tissues suggest that differences between Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice
in response to radiation injury are related to a specific
compartment and not due to a global genetic-related effect. In
order to evaluate the effect of PAI-1 deficiency in crypt epithelial
cell death, E-cadherin/TUNEL double immunostaining was
performed (Figure 2A). The number of apoptotic epithelial cells
per crypt section increased 4, 5 and 24 hours after irradiation in
both Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice, and no difference was found
between Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice at 4 and 24 hours. We
observed a slight decrease in the number of apoptotic epithelial
cells per crypt section for irradiated PAI-1 2/2 mice compared
with irradiated Wt mice for the 5 hours time point (Figure 2B–C).
These results suggest that another radiosensitive compartment
may be involved. Single TUNEL staining showed that irradiation
induced a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive
cells in the villus lamina propria of Wt and PAI-12/2 mice with a
5.9-fold increase at 4 hours and a 9-fold increase at 5 hours in Wt
mice, but only a 3.4-fold increase at 4 hours and a 4.7-fold
increase at 5 hours in PAI-12/2 mice (Figure S3). In order to
determine the level of EC apoptosis, we performed double staining
of TUNEL and CD31 as a marker of ECs. Apoptotic ECs were
identified by green nuclei surrounded by red CD31 staining
(Figure 3A). Quantification of apoptotic ECs in the lamina propria
of the villus showed an increase of apoptotic ECs 4 and 5 hours
after radiation exposure in both strains, but the effect was stronger
(p,0.05) in Wt mice compared with PAI-1 2/2 mice (Figure 3B–
C). The percentage of apoptotic ECs/total ECs revealed that there

are 35% and 37% of ECs undergoing apoptosis respectively 4 and
5 hours after radiation exposure in Wt mice, whereas there are
only 7% and 11% of apoptotic ECs in PAI-12/2 mice
(Figure 3D). Moreover, PAI-1 genetic deficiency is associated
with reduced microvascular EC damage, by decreasing the
percentage of villi showing significant EC apoptosis (3 or more
positive cells per villus) (Figure 3E). Microvascular network density
after irradiation was assessed using CD31 immunostaining and
computerized by confocal microscopy (Figure 4A). Staining areas
of CD31 were compared between the two irradiated groups and
the results showed greater microvascular density 24 hours after
irradiation in PAI-12/2 mice compared with Wt mice
(Figure 4B–C).
PAI-1 2/2 genetic deficiency in endothelial cells is
associated with radiation resistance in vitro
ECs were prepared from Wt and PAI-1 2/2 mice (Figure
S4A–D) and the endothelial phenotype was confirmed by flow
cytometry, immunohistochemistry and detection of a panel of
endothelial-specific transcripts by real-time PCR (Figure S4E–F).
Interestingly, irradiation increased PAI-1 expression in Wt ECs
(Figure S4G). In order to assess EC functionality after irradiation,

Matrigel. 24 hours after irradiation, PAI-1 2/2 ECs were still
able to form vascular-like networks, whereas irradiation of Wt ECs
was associated with reduced ability to form vascular-like networks
(p,0.05 between Wt and PAI-12/2 cells after 20 Gy; Figure 5A).
To complete these results, ECs were plated on different coatings to
increase cell adhesion. One and two days after 20 Gy irradiation,
live cells were quantified and the results showed that PAI-1 2/2
ECs were more resistant than Wt ECs (Figure 5B).
Overexpression or knockdown of PAI-1 in endothelial
cells influences sensitivity to ionizing radiation
mRNA and protein levels of PAI-1 rapidly increased after
irradiation in HUVECs (Figure S5). In order to know if PAI-1
plays a role in EC radiation sensitivity, stable HUVEC clones
overexpressing PAI-1 protein at different levels were prepared
(Figure 6A–B). Clonogenic assays were performed on 3 different
clones and results were compared with those for control HUVECs.
Results showed that overexpression of PAI-1 was associated with
increased radiation sensitivity. Figure 6C shows that the surviving
fraction for each clone decreased for irradiation doses from 0 to 4
Gy, and we show a reduced surviving fraction at 2 Gy in HUVECs
overexpressing PAI-1 compared with control HUVECs
(Figure 6D). Knockdown of PAI-1 in human ECs was performed
using siRNA. Silencing efficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR
and western blot (Fig S6). Western blot experiments showed that
PAI-1 siRNA blunted the radiation-induced overexpression of
PAI-1 (Figure 7A–B). Silencing of PAI-1 was associated with an
increase in the percentage of living cells 24 hours after irradiation
compared with non-targeting siRNA transfected cells (Figure 7C–
D).
PAI-1 influences the pro-survival Akt activation by a PTEN
dependent and a PDK-1 independent mechanism
A Taqman low density apoptosis array approach was used to
explore the effect of a human PAI-1 recombinant in 20 Gy
irradiated HUVEC cells (Fig S7). Interestingly TLDA analysis
reveals that levels of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic related
genes are regulated in HUVECS exposed to 20 Gy with a strong
increase of FAS and a strong decrease of the pro-survival gene
BIRC5. No effect was observed following treatment with
exogenous human PAI-1 recombinant compared with a latent
form of PAI-1. These results suggest that PAI-1 does not influence
radiation sensitivity of cells directly by an exocrine effect but
probably by influencing intracellular signaling. So, we next

explored consequences of PAI-1 deficiency or silencing on
signaling pathways such as Akt, MAP kinase or NF-kb that can
affect both pro-survival, pro- apoptotic or anti-apoptotic response
of endothelial cells to radiation exposure. Whereas no differences
were observed for the activation of p38 MAP Kinase, ERK 1/2,
PAI-1 genetic deficiency is associated with activation of Akt
(Figure 8A–C). After irradiation, the level of Phospho-Akt is
decreased in Wt ECs whereas the high level of phospho-Akt in
PAI-1 2/2 ECs remains maintained (Figure 8B). Akt can be
activated by phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and can
be negatively regulated through the tumor suppressor phosphatase
and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN).

Phospho-PDK1 levels remained unchanged whereas the inacti￾vated form of PTEN (phosphorylated PTEN) is increased in PAI-1
2/2 ECs compared with Wt ECs (Figure 8C). The percentage of
active form of PTEN is decreased in PAI-1 2/2 ECs (Figure 8D)
suggesting that Akt activation associated with PAI-1 genetic
deficiency is partly mediated by PTEN inactivation. In the same
way, PAI-1 silencing in HUVECS is associated with increased
activated Akt level (Figure 9A) whereas phospho-Akt expression is
reduced in HUVEC that stably overexpress PAI-1 (Figure 9B). In
siRNA PAI-1 transfected cells, no differences were observed for
p38 MAP Kinase, ERK 1/2, p65 or phospho-PDK1 levels and the
inactivated form of PTEN is increased (Figure 9A). Interestingly,
PAI-1 genetic deficiency and PAI-1 silencing is also associated with
increased levels of two anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL.
We evaluated consequences of PTEN and PDK1 silencing on Akt
activation (Figure 9C). Whereas PDK-1 knockdown decreased the
Phospho-Akt level, PTEN or PAI-1 knockdown protects cells from
ionizing radiation and this is associated with Akt activation
(Figure 9D–E). Phospho-Akt, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL increase in cells
transfected with siRNA PTEN, siRNA PAI-1 or both. This
observation was confirmed in murine ECs (Fig S8) and suggest
that pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways were involved in the
PAI-1-dependent ionizing radiation response of endothelial cells.
Discussion
Radiation-induced intestinal side effects remain a problem in
pelvic cancer treatment because of a lack of therapeutics to
prevent and/or reduce damage [32]. Most experiments in models
of radiation-induced intestinal damage were performed after total￾body irradiation with or without bone marrow transplantation. In
these models, endothelial and epithelial cell apoptosis is widely
described to be crucial in the initiation of gastrointestinal
syndrome. It has been shown that EC apoptosis is the primary
event initiating gastrointestinal syndrome in mice [20]. EC
apoptosis occurs in the 4–6 hours following irradiation and
precedes crypt epithelial clonogenic cell death. More recently,
Rotolo et al. showed that bax2/2 and bak 2/2 mice were
rescued from gastrointestinal syndrome and demonstrated that
bax and bak have nonredundant functional roles in radiation￾induced microvascular cell death, but not in crypt stem cell death
[33]. However, the relative contribution of microvascular
endothelium and clonogenic crypt cells to radiation-induced
gastrointestinal syndrome is still a matter of debate. This
controversy is born from the prevailing concept established for
many years claiming that gastrointestinal syndrome is mainly due
to the crypt stem and clonogenic cell death [21]. After total-body
irradiation, numerous studies have shown that gastrointestinal
syndrome is associated with EC death [20,34–37]. However,
therapeutic strategies to rescue mice from gastrointestinal
syndrome or transgenic mice protected from gastrointestinal
syndrome are sometimes associated with endothelial protection
[20,36,37], epithelial protection [34,38] or both [35]. Finally, one
group described no EC apoptosis in the intestine after specific
irradiation of the endothelium with intravascular boronated
liposomes [39,40]. However, technical difficulties and artifacts in

immunohistochemistry detection of apoptotic cells on paraffin
sections could in part explain the controversy [41,42]. Neverthe￾less, a lot of supportive evidence argues for a strong contribution of
microvascular destruction in early intestinal radiation toxicity, but
the causal relationship between EC apoptosis, crypt cell apoptosis
and consequent progression of intestinal damage is still unclear.
Here we used a pertinent model of localized intestinal injury
adapted to the study of acute and late effects [12,43]. In this model
we recently showed that PAI-1 pharmacological inhibition
conferred temporary protection against early lethality and that
PAI-1 genetic deficiency conferred complete protection [31].
These results suggested that PAI-1 could be involved in

radiosensitivity of the microvascular and stem cell compartments.
In the present work, immunohistochemical detection of apoptotic
endothelial and epithelial cells was performed on frozen sections to
avoid technique-dependent misinterpretation. In the model of
radiation enteropathy, our results strongly support the concept
that endothelial apoptosis is a key event involved in acute radiation
intestinal injury and consequently in the progression of radiation￾induced fibrosis. Reduced radiation-induced intestinal damage
observed in PAI-1 2/2 mice is associated with a strong reduction
in EC death. This observation in vivo was confirmed in vitro with
multiple approaches. First we show that, after irradiation, the
functionality of murine ECs isolated from PAI-12/2 mice aorta is
preserved. Using a functional test that integrates different
parameters such as the adhesion rate, the ability to proliferate
and to migrate, and the radiation-induced cell death test, we
showed that PAI-1 2/2 ECs are still able to form vascular-like
tubes after irradiation. It has been shown that murine PAI-12/2
ECs have enhanced rates of proliferation compared with Wt ECs
and are more resistant to wortmannin-induced apoptosis [29,30].
Our results obtained in murine ECs plated on different surfaces
coated with vitronectin, poly-L-ornithine/laminin, poly-L-lysine
or poly-D-lysine show that PAI-1 2/2 ECs are more resistant to
radiation-induced cell death than Wt ECs. Moreover we provide
evidence that PAI-1 genetic deficiency directly influences survival
of ECs suggesting that the differences in abilities of Wt and PAI 1
2/2 ECs to form vascular-like networks can be due to both lower
capacity of Wt cells to proliferate and higher levels of radiation￾induced apoptosis. To complete these observations, we modulated
PAI-1 gene expression in HUVECs. With a classic test of
radiosensitivity, we showed that overexpression of PAI-1 confers
enhanced radiation sensitivity on the cells, and the surviving
fraction is linked to the level of PAI-1 expression. In contrast, PAI￾1 knockdown is associated with an increased rate of survival in
HUVECs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PAI-1
plays a key role in radiation-induced EC death and suggest that
this contributes strongly to the progression of radiation-induced
intestinal injury. PAI-1-dependent mechanisms associated with
pro-apoptosis or pro-survival pathways in irradiated endothelium
are unknown and require further study.
The role of PAI-1 in angiogenesis and apoptosis of vascular cells
is controversial. PAI-1 is described as pro-angiogenic [44] or anti￾angiogenic [45,46]. For example, studies on prostatic tumor PC-3
cells conditionally expressing active PAI-1 regulated by doxycy￾cline, showed that PAI-1 strongly decreased tumor progression
through the destruction of tumor vascularization. The doxycy￾cline-induced PAI-1 pool anti-angiogenic effect is due to an early
wave of apoptosis in tumor ECs and this effect was described as
vitronectin-dependent [47]. Clearly, the angiogenic effects of PAI￾1 are dose-dependent [48]. At physiological concentration PAI-1
promotes angiogenesis whereas high concentrations of PAI-1 are
anti-angiogenic. Interestingly, in vitro, the ceramide antagonist
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) protects endothelial cells from
radiation-induced apoptosis [49] and, in vivo, S1P specifically
protects intestinal microvascular endothelial cells through a
mechanism involving activation of Akt [50]. Here, we showed
that PAI-1 genetic deficiency is associated with Akt activation in
endothelial cells and resistance to radiation-induced cell death. Akt
activation can occurs by different mechanisms including negative
regulation by PTEN or activation by the phosphoinositide￾dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). In our experimental
conditions, the PAI-1-dependent activation of Akt is not linked
to PDK-1 activation. Phosphorylation of PTEN results in its
inactivation and we report that PAI-1 genetic deficiency of murine
ECs or knockdown of PAI-1 in HUVECs increase the inactivated
form of PTEN. Consequently decreased active PTEN pool may
probably lead to Akt activation. This is in accordance with Balsara
et al who showed that PAI-1-deficient ECs have enhanced
Akt(Ser(P)473) level due to enhanced inactivation of PTEN. This
Akt hyperactivation is associated with increased levels of inactive
caspase-9 and lower levels of active caspase-3, thus rendering PAI￾1 2/2 ECs resistant to spontaneous apoptosis or chemical￾induced pro-apoptotic signals [29]. In addition, we observed that
PAI-1 genetic deficiency or silencing is associated with increased
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Interestingly Akt was reported to
increase these two anti-apoptotic genes in endothelial cells
contributing to cell survival [51,52]. Because neither p38MAPk,
ERK 1/2 or NF-kB seems to be influenced by PAI-1 knockdown,
our results strongly suggest that the PAI-1 dependent Akt
activation is involved in the overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL.
The precise mechanism by which PAI-1 influences survival
pathways are still unclear and future researches are needed to
answer this question.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PAI-1 genetic
deficiency is associated with a strong anti-apoptotic effect on ECs
in the acute phase, with higher microvascular density and
decreased radiation-injury score during acute, sub-acute and late
phases of radiation enteropathy. This study indicates that
radiation-induced overexpression of PAI-1 in ECs has pro￾apoptotic effects and contributes to the destruction of the
microcirculation in the intestine. Further experiments are
necessary to explore the molecular mechanisms involved and the
sequential involvement of PAI-1 in the initiation and progression
of radiation-induced fibrosis.
