Summary
The clinical importance of asymptomatic proximal and distal
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) remains uncertain and controver￾sial.The aim of thisretrospective,post-hoc analysis wasto exam￾ine mortality and risk factors for development of proximal DVT
in hospitalized patients with acute medical illness who were re￾cruited into a randomized,prospective clinical trial of thrombo￾prophylaxis with dalteparin (PREVENT).We analyzed 1738 pa￾tients who had not sustainedasymptomatic venous throm￾boembolic event by Day 21 and who had a complete compres￾sion ultrasound of the proximal and distal leg veins on Day 21.
We examined the 90-day mortality rates in patients with asymp￾tomatic proximal DVT (Group I, N=80), asymptomatic distal
DVT (Group II,N=118) or no DVT (Group III,N=1540).The
90-day mortality rates were 13.75%, 3.39%, and 1.92% for

Groups I–III, respectively.The difference in mortality between
GroupIand Group III was significant (hazard ratio 7.63, 95% CI
= 3.8–15.3;p < 0.0001),whereasthe difference between Groups
II and III did not reach significance (hazard ratio 1.36, 95% CI =
0.41–4.45).The association of asymptomatic proximal DVT with
increased mortality remained highly significant after adjusting
for differences in baseline demographics and clinical variables.
Risk factors significantly associated with the development of
proximal DVT included advanced age (p = 0.0005),prior DVT (p
= 0.001), and varicose veins (p = 0.04). In conclusion, the high
mortality rate in patients with asymptomatic proximal DVT
underscores its clinical relevance and supports targeting of
asymptomatic proximal DVT as an appropriate endpoint in clini￾cal trials of thromboprophylaxis.

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein throm￾bosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is often undetected
and asymptomatic in hospitalized patients. Prophylaxis may be
the most effective means of reducing the morbidity and mortal￾ity associated with this condition (1, 2).
Proximal DVT is more commonly associated with PE than
distal DVT (3–9), but the relative risk of death associated with
asymptomatic proximal versus distal DVT continues to be a
source of controversy and uncertainty. The recently completed
Prospective Evaluation of Dalteparin Efficacy for Prevention of
VTEin Immobilized PatientsTrial(PREVENT)investigated the
efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin, daltepa￾rin, for the prevention of VTE in groups of acutely ill hospital￾ized patients with risk factors for VTE. The objectives of this
post hoc retrospective analysis of PREVENT data were: 1) to
compare the mortality ratesin patients with asymptomatic proxi￾mal DVT, asymptomatic distal DVT, or no DVT, and 2) to ident￾ify risk factors for development of proximal DVT.
Materials and methods
We conducted a retrospective, post-hoc analysis of patients en￾rolled in the PREVENT study. PREVENT was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational

trial of once-daily dalteparin (5000 IU subcutaneous) or placebo
for 14 days, with a follow-up period of 90 days, for the preven￾tion ofVTE in acutely ill hospitalized patients.The methods have
been described in detail previously (10, 11).
Patients were at least 40 years of age with an acute medical
condition requiring a projected hospitalization for 4 or more days
and had had no more than 3 days of prior immobilization. The
major diagnostic subgroups in PREVENT included acute con￾gestive heart failure (NewYork Heart Association [NYHA] class
III or IV), acute respiratory failure that did not require ventila￾tory support or other acute medical conditions. Patients in the
latter group had to have at least one of the following additional
risk factors: age ≥75 years, cancer, previous DVT or PE, obesity
(body mass index ≥30 kg/m2
for men and ≥28.6 kg/m2
for
women), varicose veins and/or chronic venous insufficiency,
hormone replacement therapy, history of chronic heart failure,
chronic respiratory failure, or myeloproliferative syndrome.
The primary endpoint of PREVENT was the composite of
objectively verified symptomatic DVT, PE, asymptomatic proxi￾mal DVT, and sudden death by Day 21. Symptomatic VTE
required imaging confirmation (e.g., compression ultrasound or
venography for DVT, lung scans or angiography for PE). Patients
who did not have confirmed symptomaticVTE by Day 21 under￾went compression ultrasound examination of the lower extrem￾ity. The compression ultrasound was performed in both legs on a
centimeter-by-centimeter basis, was recorded on videotape, and
forwarded to a core reading lab for blinded evaluation. The prin￾cipal criterion for diagnosis of DVT wasfailure ofavein to com￾press completely upon the application of pressure. If both a
proximal and distal DVT were identified, the patient was as￾signed to the proximal-DVT group.
The present report includes patients for whom a technically
adequate (i.e., including proximal and distal veins) Day-21 com￾pression ultrasound was available and for whom the vital status
at Day 90 was known.
The management of patients with DVT, either proximal or
distal, was left to the discretion ofthe treating physicians and was
not dictated by the protocol. Data on patient managementfollow￾ing the diagnosis of DVT were not collected.
Correlations were calculated using univariate and multivari￾ate models(stepwise logistic regression analyses). For multivari￾ate analysis, death was the dependent variable and the indepen￾dent variables included baseline demographic and clinical char￾acteristics(including all of the qualifying diagnostic categories),
and the presence of proximal or distal DVT.
Results
A total of 3706 patients were enrolled at 219 centers in 26 coun￾tries (11). The incidence of the primary composite endpoint was
2.77% in the dalteparin group and 4.96% in the placebo group, a
risk reduction of 45% (relative risk 0.55; 95% CI 0.38–0.80; p
= 0.0015).
Of patients alive on Day 21 who had not sustained a sympto￾matic, verified event, 1738 had an adequate compression ultra￾sound of both the proximal and distal veins and constitute the

population for this analysis. Of these 1738 patients, 80 (27 dalte￾parin and 53 placebo) had asymptomatic proximal DVT (Group
I), 118 (54 dalteparin and 64 placebo) had asymptomatic distal
DVT (Group II), and 1540 (778 dalteparin and 762 placebo) had
no DVT (Group III). Baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1.
Eleven GroupIpatients (13.8%) had died by Day 90 com￾pared with 4 Group II patients (3.4%) and 30 Group III patients
(1.9%) with no DVT (p < 0.001 Group I versus Group III; p =
0.0014 Group I versus Group II; p = 0.29 Group II versus Group
III). The hazard ratio for mortality in Group I versus Group III
was 7.63 (95% CI = 3.8–15.3). The hazard ratio for mortality in
Group II versus Group III was 1.36 (95% CI = 0.41–4.45).
Among patients with proximal DVT, 2 patients receiving dalte￾parin died (7.4%) and 9 patientsin the placebo group died (17%).
The survival curves for the three groups are illustrated in Fig￾ure 1.The curves separate early and the difference in cumulative
mortality progressesthrough the observation period. The adjudi￾cated causes of death between Day 21 and Day 90 are summar￾ized in Table 2. In multivariate analysis, only two variables were
associated with a significantly increased risk of death: asympto￾matic proximal DVT (p < 0.0001) and age >75 (p = 0.0051).The
individual clinical variables that were significantly associated
with the development of proximal DVT included age ≥75 (p =
0.0005), prior DVT (p = 0.001), and varicose veins (p = 0.04).
Discussion
We have demonstrated that, in an acutely ill, immobilized medi￾cal population, the presence of compression ultrasound-ident￾ified asymptomatic proximal DVT was associated with a high
90-day mortality. No previous study has linked the presence of
asymptomatic proximal DVT to mortality. The Group I mortality
rate of 13.8% was comparable to the12.5% mortality rate ob￾served in high risk patients with symptomatic proximal DVT in
the PREPIC study (12) and the 17.4% 90-day mortality rate pre￾viously reported in a large study of patients with PE (13). In
contrast in the present study, the observed increase in 90-day
mortality in the presence of asymptomatic distal DVT did not
reach statistical significance.
The association between asymptomatic proximal DVT and
90-day mortality persisted in univariate and multivariate ana￾lyses. Therefore, though there were differences in baseline char￾acteristics among the three groups of patients (e.g. in the preva￾lence of underlying diagnoses), these did not account for the dif￾ference in 90-day mortality. However, other unidentified base￾line characteristics could confound the results.
The finding that asymptomatic proximal DVT is associated
withahigh mortality rate supports the use of asymptomatic
proximal DVT as an appropriate endpoint in clinical trials of
thromboprophylaxis. Furthermore, this emphasizes the critical
importance of prevention of VTE because it is not routine prac￾tice to conduct surveillance imaging in asymptomatic patients.
Though our study did not demonstrate a significant differ￾ence in mortality between Groups II and III, this cannot be con￾strued as proof that distal DVTs are benign. There was a numeri￾cal increase in mortality among patients with distal DVTs com￾pared with patients without DVT. It would require a substantially

larger sample size to adequately address whether or not this rep￾resents a significant increase in mortality.
We also identified advanced age, prior history of VTE, and
varicose veins as the most potent predictors of patients who de￾velop proximal DVT.
There are several limitations to the present study. Compres￾sion ultrasound is more accurate for the diagnosis of proximal
DVT than it is for diagnosing distal DVT (14). Thus, our obser￾vations with respect to distal DVTs are less certain than our ob￾servations with respect to proximal DVTs. However, we included
in the present analysis only those patients who had had a tech￾nically adequate compression ultrasound of both proximal and
distal veins, and we ensured the uniformity of ultrasonographic
criteria by using a core lab.
The association between proximal DVT and subsequent mor￾tality does not necessarily establish causality.Although a blinded
endpoints committee adjudicated the causes of death, we cannot
be certain of the precise contribution of VTE to the observed
fatalities. DVT or PE asacausative or contributing factor to
deaths in this population with significant cardiac or pulmonary
disease was not systematically evaluated. Without autopsy data,
it would be nearly impossible to ascertain the precise frequency
of PE. Furthermore, the association of proximal DVT and in￾creased mortality could reasonably be interpreted in several
ways. Plausible explanationsinclude that the proximal DVT’s di￾rectly contributed to increased mortality via their propensity to
embolize or, alternatively, that developing a DVT is a marker for
severe underlying illness.
Asymptomatic proximal DVT is often used as an endpoint in
clinical trials of VTE prophylaxis. Our study demonstrated the
clinical importance of asymptomatic proximal DVT as a marker
of high mortality risk and thus provides evidence supporting the
use of asymptomatic proximal DVT as an endpoint in preventive
studies.
