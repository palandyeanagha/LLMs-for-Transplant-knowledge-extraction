ABSTRACT
Thiopurines are often the mainstay of treatment
for many patients with inflammatory bowel
disease. As such, a general understanding of the
evidence behind their use and of their
metabolism is extremely useful in clinical practice.
This review gives a practical overview of
thiopurine metabolism, the importance of
thiopurine S-methyltransferase testing prior to
the start of therapy and the monitoring of
thioguanine nucleotide levels while on
treatment, guiding a personalised approach to
optimising thiopurine therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a
chronic inflammatory disorder of the gut,
divided into two main diseases, ulcerative
colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).
Over the last decade there has been a
shift in paradigm of the treatment of IBD
with a ‘top down’ or ‘rapid step-up’
approach aimed at altering the natural
history early in the course of the disease.
Newer drugs, especially biologics, are being
used for the treatment of IBD, and existing
drugs such as thiopurines are being used
more effectively by guiding individual
dosing according to pharmacogenetic data
and monitoring of drug metabolite levels.
Sixty per cent of patients with IBD
receive thiopurines (azathioprine (AZA),
mercaptopurine (MP) and to a lesser
extent tioguanine) with proven efficacy in
maintaining steroid-free remission.1
Although the evidence for the use of
thiopurines in UC is not as strong as in
patients with CD, it has been demon￾strated that in patients with steroid￾dependent UC, 53% achieved steroid-free
remission on AZA compared with 21%
on aminosalicylates.2 Therefore, thiopur￾ines are recommended once a patient has
required two courses of steroids within a
year.3 Thiopurines are commenced
earlier in CD, where aminosalicylates
play little or no role, and have been
demonstrated to reduce the need for
surgery by 40%.4 The SONIC (Study of
Biologic and Immunomodulator Naive
Patients in CD) trial study showed the
benefit of thiopurines in addition to anti￾tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents in
the treatment of CD, most likely through
reduced formation of antidrug antibodies
against anti-TNF agents.5
Up to a third of patients have to stop
thiopurines due to side effects, the main
concerns being leucopenia (1.3–12.6%),
hepatotoxicity (4%), pancreatitis (3%)
and gastric intolerance (1.3–6%).6 7
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)
activity influences the incidence of
adverse effects, particularly bone marrow
toxicity, however, there is no association
with hepatotoxicity or pancreatitis.8
THIOPURINE METABOLISM
The prodrug AZA is converted
non-enzymatically by biogenic thiols,
including glutathione, to MP with the
release of methyl-4-nitro-5-imidazole.
Following uptake by transporters, MP
undergoes metabolism by three compet￾ing pathways (see figure 1) to form the
active metabolite, thioguanine nucleo￾tides (TGNs) which function as rogue
nucleic acids, disrupting the DNA replica￾tion of the most rapidly dividing cells
such as activated T cell lymphocytes
where TGN concentrations have been
found to be higher and where genes
involved in T cell immunity have been
shown to be downregulated by AZA.9
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE
Methylation of MP by TPMT is a critical
step in thiopurine metabolism. It was first

noted in the 1980s that differences in TPMT activity
help account for the variability in tolerance to thiopur￾ines. Rare and common genetic polymorphisms influ￾ence enzyme function resulting in a trimodal
population distribution of activity. In Caucasians, com￾plete TPMT deficiency occurs in 1 in 300 individuals.
Carriers of a deficiency-associated allele (heterozygotes)
have around 50% enzyme activity and occur at an
approximate frequency of 1 in 10 of the population.10
The majority of cases of TPMT deficiency (∼95%) are
associated with three alleles, TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and
TPMT*3C.11 The frequency of these variants depends
on ethnicity with TPMT*3A being more common in
Caucasian populations.12
Individuals with complete TPMT deficiency who
receive standard doses of AZA or MP are highly likely
to develop severe and potentially fatal myelosuppres￾sion. There is a small case series of patients with IBD
treated with around 10% of standard doses, all of
whom tolerated this well.13 Heterozygotes are also at
risk of toxicity at standard doses but this is prevented
by initiation at 50% of the conventional dose. Hence,
recommended practice is to check TPMT levels prior
to starting therapy and adjusting the dose according
to TPMT status.
Ultrahigh TPMT (>40 pmol/mg Hb/h) is associated
with a skewed drug metabolism in a selection of
patients where MP is preferentially metabolised to
methylmercaptopurine (MeMP) resulting in lower
TGNs which in turn are associated with a poorer
clinical response and side effects. This preferential
metabolism to MeMP or ‘shunting’ is known as
hypermethylation.14
TPMT phenotyping by enzyme assay is generally
preferred to genotyping, as the assay will detect all
completely deficient patients, irrespective of whether
the patient has a rare or common variant TPMT geno￾type. Other factors influencing TPMT activity, for
example red cell age, also result in discordance
between genotype and phenotype, particularly in the
high carrier range.15
THIOGUANINE NUCLEOTIDES
Although important, TPMT polymorphisms account
for only 10% of overall thiopurine toxicity.16 Indeed,
50–75% of all patients developing leucopenia have a
normal TPMT and only 3% of hypermethylators have
ultrahigh TPMT.17 Measuring TGNs provides a
summary of epigenetic and genetic factors influencing
thiopurine metabolism and, together with measure￾ment of MeMP, offers a means for therapeutic drug
monitoring.
Measurement of TGNs and MeMP in red blood
cells (RBCs) has been shown to be clinically useful
after steady state is reached at 4–6 weeks.18
Meta-analyses suggest that a therapeutic range of
TGN between 235 pmol/8×108 and 450 pmol/8×108
RBCs correlates best with a good clinical response.19 20
In addition, there is evidence that TGN monitoring in
IBD is associated with improved outcomes with a
negative correlation between RBC TGNs and disease
activity.21 A treatment strategy using TGNs to deter￾mine optimal dosing resulted in improved outcomes
in 90% of patients compared with 33% in those not
guided by TGNs.18
HYPERMETHYLATION
Approximately 15–20% of patients with IBD demon￾strate hypermethylation when treated with thiopur￾ines.16 The usual definition of hypermethylation is a

the first being degradation to TUA which is then excreted, the second is through methylation by TPMT into MeMP, and the third is
the breakdown of MP into TIMP catalysed by HPRT. TIMP is then further metabolised via IMPDH into TGMP. Kinases convert this into
the TGNs. Approximately 15–20% of patients with IBD demonstrate hypermethylation when treated with thiopurines. This means
that during thiopurine metabolism, methylated thiopurine metabolites are preferentially produced instead of TGNs.

ratio of MeMP to TGN of >11. In this setting, sub￾therapeutic TGNs risk a poor response to therapy.
Moreover, MeMP >5700 pmol/8×108 RBCs results
in a higher risk of hepatotoxicity.20
Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that pre￾vents the breakdown of thiopurines into thiouric acid
(TUA). It was designed to increase the bioavailability
of MP by preventing degradation to TUA. The com￾bination of low dose thiopurine and 100 mg of allo￾purinol (LDTA) corrects hypermethylation in patients
who have failed therapy due to hepatotoxicity or who
have had a poor response to treatment in association
with subtherapeutic TGNs.14 22 When using the com￾bination, the administered dose of AZA or MP is
reduced to 25–50% of the standard monotherapy
dose.23
Allopurinol is a safe drug with the main side effects
including rashes and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms
but it can rarely (1:100 000) cause life-threatening
toxic epidermal necrolysis.24
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THIOPURINE TREATMENT
Prior to commencing thiopurines, patients should be
screened to help prevent opportunistic infections as
per European guidelines (see table 1). In addition, the
pneumococcal vaccination is given before starting
treatment and the influenza vaccine annually.25
Patients are advised that while on treatment they
should not have ‘live’ vaccines. The more common
‘live’ vaccines include yellow fever; measles, mumps
and rubella; and BCG (tuberculosis vaccine). The IBD
passport is a good source of information for both
patients and prescribers on foreign travel with IBD.26
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegativity in patients
commencing thiopurines has long been a concern and
it was identified in 2002 that treatment in this setting
was associated with a small increased risk of
EBV-positive lymphomas.27 More recently in the
CESAME observational cohort, thiopurine treatment
had an HR of 5.28 for developing lymphoproliferative
disorders with EBV infection being a further risk
factor.28 The risk remains small and as yet, avoidance
of these drugs in seronegative individuals is not
advised. European guidelines suggests considering
anti-TNF monotherapy as opposed to combination
therapy with thiopurines.25
OPTIMISING CLINICAL RESPONSE
Measuring TGNs has been proven to improve clinical
outcomes.18 We check TGNs in all patients who have
symptoms or active disease. We also check TGNs
4 weeks after starting thiopurines or following a
change in the dose (see figure 2). The onset of response
from thiopurines is around 16 weeks so if being pre￾scribed as monotherapy, bridging with corticosteroids
or an alternative therapy should be considered.29
Where TGNs are subtherapeutic, increasing the
dose by between 25 mg and 50 mg may be enough
for TGNs to reach the therapeutic range. If patients
are hypermethylating, and TGNs subtherapeutic, we
recommend either switching to LDTA or dose split￾ting. The rationale behind dose splitting is that the
reduced dose of thiopurine is below the optimum sub￾strate affinity for TPMT. In a review of 20 patients
with baseline MeMP levels greater than 7000 pmol/
8×108 RBCs, dose splitting resulted in a significant
decrease in MeMP levels without reducing TGNs.30
MANAGING SIDE EFFECTS
There are a number of different strategies employed
when addressing adverse effects experienced on thio￾purines which are discussed below (see figure 3).
For side effects other than pancreatitis, switching to
LDTA achieves clinical remission in 78% of patients
and has been found to reduce levels of MeMP while
increasing TGNs to within therapeutic range.24 The

lowest available doses of AZA and MP come in a
liquid form at 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL, respectively,
both of which are off-licence. For logistical reasons
we advise patients who need to take the lowest dose
to take 1.5 mL/1 mL of AZA alternate days or halve a
25 mg tablet of MP (12.5 mg).
GASTROINTESTINAL SIDE EFFECTS
Nausea is common with thiopurines. Changing the
timing of the dose from morning to later in the day or
at night can sometimes alleviate this. Switching to MP
is well recognised to circumvent some cases of AZA
induced nausea.31 A further option is to increase the
dose of thiopurine gradually over 2–4 weeks rather
than start at the maximum dose. Finally, switching to
LDTA has been proven to successfully circumvent
nausea in over a half of patients.24
BONE MARROW TOXICITY
Myelosuppression has been associated with low
TPMT activity and with MeMP >11 450 pmol/8×108
RBCs.32 In this scenario, we adopt the same approach
to that of hypermethylation and hepatotoxicity and
switch to LDTA. Where leucopenia occurs in the
absence of hypermethylation, our practice is to alter
dosing according to relevant blood count parameters
(see figure 4). In the case of lymphopenia, adjustment
is debateable, as studies suggest patients with lympho￾penia are not at increased risk of infections.33
HEPATOTOXICITY
Four per cent of patients experience thiopurine
related hepatotoxicity. If this occurs the drug should
be stopped until the liver function tests have normal￾ised followed by commencing LDTA. MeMP levels
>5700 pmol/8×108 RBCs have been associated with
a threefold increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity.20
However, a proportion of patients develop hepatotox￾icity in the absence of hypermethylation. Interestingly,
in these patients, hepatotoxicity is also successfully cir￾cumvented in most cases by switching to LDTA.
PANCREATITIS
In the 3% of patients who develop pancreatitis, thio￾purines are immediately stopped. Reports of success￾ful rechallenge or switch to MP have been published,
but, in general, the risk of repeat pancreatitis is high
and we do not therefore recommend rechallenge with
AZA or MP in this setting. Tioguanine, however, at
doses of 20–40 mg, is an alternative to AZA and MP,
which successfully avoids pancreatitis and is associated
with reported clinical remission rates as high as 79%
at 12 months.34
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The use of thiopurines as concomitant therapy along￾side biologics has been shown to reduce antidrug anti￾body formation.4 The therapeutic range for this is not
known. Recent studies have suggested that aiming for
lower TGNs in this setting is equally efficacious.35–37
There are good safety data on the use of thiopurines
in pregnancy and around the time of conception for
women and men and their use is supported by
European guidelines.38 39 There are however no
safety data on the use of allopurinol in pregnancy. We
advise the continued use of thiopurines throughout
pregnancy after careful discussion with the patient.
We avoid starting allopurinol during pregnancy and

would advise other treatments in situations where
allopurinol would normally be used.
Most centres consider withdrawal after 5 years of
treatment if the patient is in clinical remission.
Treatment for over 4 years has been shown to increase
the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer and lymphoma
particularly in those patients over the age of 50
years.40 There is also an association between the long￾term use of thiopurines, especially tioguanine, and
nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Where thiopurines
are withdrawn, 1 year clinical relapse rates are 23% in
CD and 12% in UC.41
CONCLUSION
Thiopurines continue to be the mainstay of therapy
for CD and moderate to severe UC. Thiopurine
metabolite monitoring in addition to TPMT measure￾ment successfully guides optimised therapy, reducing
treatment failure from adverse effects or lack of clin￾ical efficacy and is a classic example of the benefits of
personalised medicine. These benefits are clearly
evident in the treatment of IBD but should also be
relevant across many other disciplines in which thio￾purines are used as standard therapy.
