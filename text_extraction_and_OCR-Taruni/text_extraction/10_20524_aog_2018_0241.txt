Abstract Esophageal varices are one of the main complications of liver cirrhosis. Upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopy is the gold standard for the detection of esophageal varices. Many less invasive methods 
for screening of varices have been investigated and the most recent Baveno VI guidelines suggest 
that endoscopy is not necessary in patients with liver stiffness <20 kPa and platelets >150,000/μL. 
A critical review of the literature was performed concerning non-invasive or minimally invasive 
methods of screening for esophageal varices. Liver and spleen elastography, imaging methods 
including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, laboratory 
tests and capsule endoscopy are discussed. The accuracy of each method, and its advantages 
and limitations compared to endoscopy are analyzed. There are data to support the Baveno VI 
guidelines, but there is still a lack of large prospective studies and low specificity has been reported 
for the liver stiffness and platelet count combination. Spleen elastography has shown promising 
results, as there are data to support its superiority to liver elastography, but it needs further 
assessment. Computed tomography has shown high diagnostic accuracy and can be part of the 
diagnostic work up of cirrhotic patients in the future, including screening for varices.

Introduction
Esophageal varices are portosystemic collaterals developed 
in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Every year, 
a percentage of patients with cirrhosis (3-12%) develop 
esophageal varices and in 8-12% of patients, progression from 
small to large varices is detected. Spontaneous regression of 
small esophageal varices can also be observed, mainly following 
alcohol abstinence in alcoholic cirrhosis [1,2].
In the setting of variceal bleeding a 6-week mortality 
rate of 11.1-40% has been reported [3,4]. The presence of 
red spots, the size of varices, and the severity of cirrhosis are 
considered to be the most important predictors of variceal 
bleeding [5]. Treatment with β-blockers can diminish the 
probability of bleeding by 50% in patients with medium 
and large varices [6,7]. At present, the method of choice for 
identifying the presence and estimating the size of varices is 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The disadvantages of 
EGD include the complications associated with endoscopy, 
especially the need for intravenous sedation [8] and the 
relatively high cost [9]. These drawbacks have driven the 
research for new methods of variceal detection. Several 
minimally or non-invasive methods have been proposed as 
alternatives to EGD for screening for esophageal varices. The 
updated Baveno VI guidelines [10] recommend that screening 
EGD can be avoided in patients with compensated advanced 
chronic liver disease (cACLD) who have liver stiffness <20 kPa 
and a platelet count >150,000/μL [10].
Non-invasive methods also currently have a distinct role in 
clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients 
with cACLD [10]. In patients with viral-related cACLD non￾invasive methods are sufficient to rule-in CSPH, defining the 
group of patients at risk of having endoscopic signs of portal 
hypertension. Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography 
(TE) (20-25 kPa) can be used alone or in combination with

platelet count and spleen size [10,11]. Additionally, collateral 
circulation identified on imaging is sufficient to rule-in CSPH 
in patients with cACLD of all etiologies. Non-invasive methods 
do not yet have a well-established role in the follow up of 
patients with varices.
The purpose of this review is to summarize the accuracy, 
advantages and disadvantages of non-invasive methods of 
screening for esophageal varices, focusing on the evidence that 
exists in the literature as regards avoiding screening by EGD in 
certain groups of patients.
Materials and methods
We performed a literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, 
Web of Science, and CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library from 
01/2000 to 01/2017. The key words used were “(fibroscan OR 
transient elastography OR stiffness OR computed tomography 
OR magnetic resonance OR platelet spleen ratio OR Doppler 
OR capsule endoscopy OR ultrasound) AND varices”. The 
search was conducted independently by three reviewers (CT, 
AK, and CK). All manuscripts that compared non-invasive 
or minimally invasive methods of screening for esophageal 
varices to EGD were studied. We excluded studies not written 
in English and studies in children, and included only studies 
concerning esophageal varices. The references of each full-text 
article were also reviewed carefully to include studies that met 
the inclusion criteria. A  critical review of the literature was 
then performed. The studies judged most important, based 
on the number of patients, methodology, and outcomes, were 
included in the final review. Special attention was given to the 
studies validating Baveno VI guidelines. All disagreements were 
resolved after full discussion within the group of researchers.
The non-invasive methods of screening for esophageal 
varices investigated are presented in Fig.  1. The accuracy of 
each of these methods is analyzed in this review. Emphasis is 
placed on larger-scale studies and meta-analyses. The presence 
and the cause (if identifiable) of any false-positive or false￾negative results are discussed for each method. Finally, the 
potential of other methods, apart from liver elastography 
and platelet count, to serve as a screening method that could 
replace elastography is elaborated.
Results
Elastography
At present, there are three different elastography techniques 
that measure liver and spleen stiffness. TE (FibroScan) uses 
a mechanical wave generated by a special transducer, while 
acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) and shear 
wave elastography (SWE) use sound waves. TE has technical 
limitations, of which the main ones are ascites, obesity, and 
narrow intercostal spaces. Although there are new probes that 
have improved TE in obese patients [12] and patients with 
narrow intercostal spaces, such as children [13], TE remains 
unfeasible in patients with ascites [14]. ARFI and SWE have 
partly overcome these limitations and have shown higher 
success rates [15-19]. The diagnostic accuracy of all three 
methods is similar, but TE has been validated in more studies. 
The above methods have been used to correlate liver and spleen 
stiffness with the presence of varices.
Liver elastography
Liver stiffness has been proposed as a non-invasive 
surrogate marker for the presence of esophageal varices and 
many related studies have been conducted using TE, ARFI or 
SWE. The reported accuracy in most studies is satisfactory, 
although it is clear that both liver and spleen elastography are 
methods that only indirectly estimate the presence of varices, 
by evaluating the mechanical properties of the liver or spleen, 
and do not directly appreciate the hemodynamics related to the 
creation of varices. Nevertheless, a strong correlation between 
increased liver stiffness and the presence of large varices has 
been supported.
TE
A recent meta-analysis [20] that evaluated the accuracy of 
TE in the prediction of esophageal varices has shown pooled 
sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 68%, respectively, for 
the detection of large varices in patients with liver cirrhosis. 
The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.58 and 0.24 
respectively. The results of another meta-analysis were similar, 
with a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 71%, 
respectively, for the detection of large varices and positive and 
negative likelihood ratios of 2.63 and 0.27 [21]. The use of liver 
elastography as a single test in clinical practice remains limited 
because of the great variety of the cutoff values that have been 
used for the prediction of the presence of varices, which range 
from 13.4-29.7 kPa. Additionally, the reported sensitivity and

specificity of the method varies considerably among studies, 
ranging from 64 to 96% and from 44 to 100%, respectively 
[20-23]. The positive and negative likelihood ratios vary from 
1.23 to 26.54 and from 0.05 to 0.75, respectively. Results are 
more encouraging for the detection of large varices, with 
sensitivity varying from 77 to 100%, specificity from 60 to 87%, 
positive likelihood ratio from 1.65-5.79 and negative likelihood 
ratio from 0-0.48. However, the cutoff values that have been 
used again exhibit considerable variability, ranging between 
16.6 and 38.2 kPa [20,21]. Applying the cutoff value (<20 kPa) 
proposed by BAVENO VI to elastography (as a single test) for 
the detection of large varices in patients with viral hepatitis 
yielded a sensitivity of approximately 83% and a negative 
predictive value of 66.7%, not sufficient to rule out varices [24].
ARFI
ARFI has also been proven to have high sensitivity and 
specificity for the detection of varices and the diagnosis of portal 
hypertension, reaching 84% and 88%, respectively [25]. High 
diagnostic accuracy has been reported for the combination of 
ARFI and spleen diameter/platelet count ratio, with sensitivity 
and specificity of 90% and 94.3% and negative predictive value 
of 98.3% for the detection of high risk varices, using a cutoff 
value of 2.83 [26].
SWE
There are few studies with measurement of liver stiffness by 
SWE, but they have shown promising results, with sensitivity 
and specificity up to 83% and 66%, respectively [27-29]. 
Furthermore, a prospective study that directly compared the 
accuracy of SWE and TE in the detection of varices reported 
SWE to be superior [15].
The combination of liver stiffness with platelet count 
increases the accuracy of the method and is incorporated in 
the BAVENO VI guidelines [10]. BAVENO VI guidelines 
focus on large varices requiring treatment and report that 
patients with liver stiffness <20 kPa and platelet count 
>150,000/μL demonstrate a very low risk of having varices 
that need treatment; thus, they can avoid screening endoscopy. 
These guidelines have been validated recently by retrospective 
studies [30-32] and a meta-analysis [33]. Among the studies 
included in the meta-analysis, only one was prospective [33]. 
The above studies have shown negative predictive value above 
95% for the combination of liver stiffness measured by 
elastography and platelet count. Apart from the satisfactory 
sensitivity, the recent studies confirmed the threshold of 
20 kPa for liver stiffness and 150,000/μL for platelet count, with 
one exception in which a threshold of 25kPa and 100,000/μL 
platelets was proposed [34]. Nevertheless, the specificity and 
positive predictive value of the combination of liver stiffness 
and platelet count is low (29.6% and 13.7 respectively) [33].
In other studies, liver stiffness has been combined with 
spleen size and platelet count and yielded sensitivities and 
specificities of 70-86.3% and 86.2-89.6%, respectively [35,36],

not reaching the sensitivity of the studies combining only liver 
stiffness with platelet count.
Spleen elastography
Spleen elastography has emerged lately as a new approach 
for the detection of esophageal varices, with several studies 
showing high accuracy [37-42]. Although it is not included 
in the BAVENO VI guidelines, it has been reported to be 
superior to liver elastography in several studies that compared 
both methods in the same group of patients [43-45], with the 
limitation that it is not an accurate predictor for the presence 
of varices in alcohol-related cirrhosis [43]. The superiority of 
spleen elastography compared to liver elastography has been 
validated in a recent meta-analysis by Ma et al [46], who 
reported a pooled sensitivity of 88% versus 83% and a pooled 
specificity of 78% versus 66%, respectively. The diagnostic 
odds ratio of spleen stiffness (25.73) was significantly higher 
than that of liver stiffness (9.54). A  high negative predictive 
value could be achieved with a cutoff value of 18.9 kPa, even 
in a study that showed the method to have only moderate 
accuracy [47]. When combined with liver elastography it can 
reach a negative predictive value of 100%, important to define 
the group of patients that can avoid EGD [48]. Only two studies 
have reported moderate accuracy of spleen elastography for the 
detection of varices [49,50].
The technical limitations of liver elastography also apply to 
spleen elastography. Dedicated devices or software are required, 
and obesity and ascites may not allow reliable measurements 
to be obtained. Moreover, because of the small spleen size in 
some patients, it may be difficult for the operator to obtain 
good imaging of the splenic parenchyma [51].
In conclusion, spleen elastography appears to be a reliable 
method with high negative predictive value for the presence 
of varices. Further evaluation, especially in combination 
with platelet count and liver elastography, may allow the 
use of spleen elastography in the future as a screening test, 
so that EGD can be avoided in patients with negative spleen 
elastography results.
Imaging techniques
Computed tomography (CT)
CT is an imaging modality widely used in cirrhotic 
patients [52], vastly contributing to the diagnosis and 
management of the complications of cirrhosis, such 
as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CT allows direct 
visualization of esophageal varices after intravenous contrast 
administration, as serpiginous vessels that protrude in the 
lumen of the lower esophagus. CT also depicts portosystemic 
shunts in the abdomen, including periesophageal and 
perigastric veins [53,54]. Although the detection of varices is 
usually straightforward, it can be challenging to discriminate 
submucosal from subserosal esophageal varices, and this 
can be the cause for false-positive and false-negative CT 
results [53].
CT has been compared to EGD in several studies. Two recent 
meta-analyses have shown a pooled sensitivity and specificity 
for the detection of esophageal varices of approximately 
89.6% and 72.3% [55], and 87% and 80% [56], respectively. 
The sensitivity for the detection of large varices was high in 
all studies and the pooled sensitivity and specificity for large 
varices in a meta-analysis by Deng et al was 87% and 88%, 
respectively [56]. The positive and negative predictive value 
for the detection of large varices in the same meta-analysis was 
86% and 90%, respectively.
CT can be a good alternative for the detection of varices in 
cirrhotic patients with HCC, already undergoing locoregional 
treatments. The effectiveness of the treatment and the presence 
of recurrence are evaluated by CT in these patients and Kim 
et al [43] showed high sensitivity and specificity rates for the 
detection of esophageal varices (91.9% and 92.2%, respectively) 
without alteration of the CT protocol.
In the meta-analysis by Tseng et al [55] it was suggested 
that CT technology (multidetector vs. <16 detector CT) may 
be a reason for the variability among the published results. 
Nevertheless, the efficacy of standard thick-slice CT, especially 
for the detection of large varices, was demonstrated by two 
studies [57,58], without thin slice reconstruction adding 
accuracy. In addition, like ultrasonography, CT is also an 
operator-dependent method, but radiologist residents and 
endoscopists showed similar performance to specialized 
abdominal radiologists in the detection of large varices. 
Abdominal radiologists were more efficient in the detection of 
small varices compared to residents and endoscopists [59].
In the only study directly comparing CT with the platelet/
spleen diameter ratio, CT proved to have higher sensitivity 
and specificity [53]. This method is better tolerated than 
endoscopy and more readily accepted by patients, even in 
studies where air insufflation was used before performing CT 
[54]. Moreover, CT can be simultaneously used as a screening 
method for HCC and varices in cirrhotic patients. The main 
disadvantage of CT is the radiation dose, although, considering 
the high mean age of cirrhotic patients, the benefits are likely 
to outweigh the risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis 
[60]. The cost of the method is higher compared to other 
non-invasive methods, but lower compared to endoscopy 
[61]. Additionally, intravenous contrast injection is required, 
which may be contraindicated in patients with impaired renal 
function or allergy to iodine.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI has been evaluated for the detection of esophageal 
varices, but to a lesser extent compared to CT [62-64]. 
Direct visualization of esophageal varices by MRI is more 
challenging than with CT and movement artifacts are much 
more common. There are reports that detection of varices is 
feasible [62]. Intravenous injection of gadolinium yielded 
enhanced results [63,64]. The reported accuracy is not high 

Non-invasive screening for esophageal varices

(with a sensitivity of less than 81%) and in fact appears to be 
inferior to the accuracy of CT [65].
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has been used to 
grade the severity of cirrhosis, with the advantage of full organ 
coverage [66] and low variability for stiffness measurement. 
Excellent interscan reproducibility [67-69] and inter-reader 
agreement [70] have been shown. Liver stiffness calculation by 
MRE with [71] or without [72] contrast-enhanced MRI [71] 
reached sensitivities of 88.9% and 96% and specificities of 
56.4% and 60%, respectively. False-positive results are usually 
related to the presence of other portosystemic collaterals and 
false-negative results can occur because of iron deposition 
in the liver and the presence of large volume ascites [71]. In 
a study by Morisaka et al [73], MRE was able to discriminate 
the presence or absence of varices, but failed to distinguish 
patients with large varices from patients with small varices. 
Spleen stiffness measured by MRE has been shown to be more 
strongly correlated with the presence of large varices than with 
liver stiffness [74,75]. Available data have not demonstrated 
a clear benefit from the use of MRE compared to ultrasound 
elastography [71-73]. Additionally, the cost and duration of 
the examination are higher, and the equipment required is not 
available in most departments.
The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the spleen is a 
parameter that can be calculated simply from a single diffusion 
weighted sequence on MRI. Recently Razek et al investigated 
the correlation between the ADC value in the spleen and 
the presence of varices in cirrhotic patients [76]. There were 
statistically significant differences among normal volunteers, 
cirrhotic patients and cirrhotic patients with varices, and when 
cutoff values of 1.15 and 1.29 × 10-3 mm2
/sec were used to 
separate these groups, the resulting areas under the curve were 
0.872 and 0.889, respectively.
MRI has also been used to obtain measurements of liver 
size, and the ratio between the volume of the right lobe and 
albumin levels showed a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 
83.5% for the detection of varices [77]. Finally, the presence of 
Gamna-Gandy bodies (splenic siderotic nodules) in the spleen 
has been positively correlated with the presence of varices, but 
the usefulness of this finding needs to be validated [78].
The use of MRI compared to CT has the advantage of the 
lack of ionizing radiation, but has more contraindications 
(pacemaker, metallic implants, claustrophobia). Its cost is 
relatively high, and the measurements of liver stiffness or liver 
dimensions did not produce better results compared to the 
studies performed by ultrasound. The correlation of the spleen 
ADC with the presence of varices is promising but has to be 
validated by more studies.
Doppler ultrasonography
Various indexes measured by Doppler ultrasonography 
have been proposed as non-invasive predictors of the presence 
of esophageal varices. In a study that compared several 
Doppler indexes [79], portal vascular resistance ([0.066 × 
splenic artery pulsatility index - 0.044] × portal blood flow), 
hemodynamic liver index (portal vein [PV] diameter/PV mean 
velocity) and splenoportal index (SPI = spleen long diameter 
× spleen short diameter/mean velocity in the PV) were the 
best predictors for the presence of esophageal varices, with 
sensitivities of 76%, 65% and 63% and specificities of 92%, 
92% and 92%, respectively [79]. However, all these parameters 
failed to accurately predict the presence of large varices. Liver 
elastography in this study was superior to all the Doppler 
indexes and had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 100%, 
respectively, for the detection of varices. SPI has been proved to 
be a good predictor of the presence of varices in several other 
studies [80], with a sensitivity up to 96% [81] but relatively low 
specificity.
Among the other Doppler indices, the congestion index 
(CIx) of the PV, first described by Moriyasu [82], has been 
more widely investigated. This parameter represents the ratio 
between the cross-sectional area (cm2
) and the blood flow 
velocity (cm/sec) of the PV: CIx = (pP2/4)/PV mean, where P 
is the PV diameter and PV mean represents the mean portal 
flow velocity [83]. Although the first results were promising 
for the detection of varices, large varices [84] and red 
spots [85], other studies failed to confirm these results [86] or 
demonstrated better predictive values for other indices, such as 
PV velocity [87].
To date, the role of Doppler ultrasonography remains to 
be determined and the optimal Doppler index varies among 
studies. Doppler ultrasonography has the disadvantage of being 
operator-  and equipment-dependent; therefore, the potential 
for acquiring accurate and reproducible results in relation to 
the presence of varices is limited.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound
In a recent study, contrast enhanced ultrasound was evaluated 
for the detection of varices [88]. Although direct visualization 
of esophageal varices was not feasible, the parameters measured 
yielded high sensitivity and specificity (96.9% and 90.0% 
respectively) for the detection of varices. Ultrasound has low cost 
and no ionizing radiation or iodinated contrast material so these 
promising results have to be validated by further studies [88].
Laboratory tests
A wide range of laboratory tests have been evaluated as 
predictors for the presence of varices. The most investigated 
parameter is the platelet count to spleen diameter ratio [89]. 
The advantage of this parameter is the fact that a constant 
cutoff value (909) has been used in most of the studies, 
which enables its use in clinical practice. A  recent meta￾analysis, which included 20 studies and 3063  patients [89], 
showed pooled sensitivities and specificities of 92% and 87%, 
respectively, at the threshold of 909, with a positive predictive 
value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 90%. These 
results have been validated in subgroups of patients with 
specific etiologies of cirrhosis, including hepatitis C [35,90] 
and schistosomiasis [91]. However, several studies failed to 
reproduce the above encouraging results [53,92-96].

A. Karatzas et al
Annals of Gastroenterology 31
The spleen volume and the right liver lobe volume, 
measured by MRI, have also been proposed in combination 
with platelet count as screening methods for the detection of 
esophageal varices [97], but the benefit of such a complicated 
measurement is doubtful, compared to the measurement of 
the spleen diameter by ultrasound. Additionally, the platelet 
count alone may predict the presence of large varices, although 
less accurately, which could be a cheap and readily available 
screening method in countries with limited resources [98].
In a comparative study of several parameters, the platelet 
to spleen diameter ratio and the PV diameter measured 
by CT were the most accurately predictive factors for the 
presence of large varices in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis 
C [99]. Various combinations of laboratory findings with 
demographic parameters and ultrasound parameters [100], 
serum liver fibrosis markers [101], or even fibrosis parameters 
from liver biopsy [102], have been shown to correlate with the 
presence of esophageal varices, but these results have not been 
validated. A meta-analysis of various non-invasive laboratory 
findings yielded only moderate accuracy, especially for large 
varices [99].
In conclusion, although correlations between several 
laboratory parameters and the presence of varices have been 
demonstrated, none were strong enough to allow detection 
of varices with a single laboratory test. As discussed in the 
section on liver elastography above, the combination of the 
platelet count with liver stiffness measurements has proven 
to be a valuable predictor of the presence of varices. Other 
laboratory measurements need further validation, especially in 
combination with liver stiffness, and may produce even better 
results in the future.
Capsule endoscopy
Wireless video capsule endoscopy was originally designed 
as a small-bowel imaging device. It was approved by the United 
States Food and Drug Administration in November 2004 
as an alternative technique for the detection of esophageal 
varices [103]. The diagnostic pooled sensitivity and specificity 
in a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies [103] were 83% and 
85%, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for 
the grading of medium to large varices were 72% and 91%, 
respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of this method, especially 
after taking into consideration its high cost [104], is moderate 
and not comparable to classic endoscopy.
The use of special strings attached to the capsule, which help 
control its movement, has yielded the highest accuracy [105]. 
The sensitivity and specificity in this study reached 96% and 
100%, respectively. However, these results were not validated 
by another string capsule study, which showed sensitivity and 
specificity of 84% and 72%, respectively [106]. Nevertheless, 
it has been shown that string capsule endoscopy improves 
visualization of the distal esophagus, which may potentially 
have an impact on the detection of esophageal varices [107].
A more recent study using the PillCam capsule in 
62  patients [108] showed even less satisfactory results, with 
a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 50% for the detection 
of varices and 55% and 91% for the detection of large varices, 
respectively. Capsule endoscopy did not detect gastric varices 
in all 13 patients in the same study [108]. Capsule endoscopy 
was preferred to EGD by the patients [108,109], although 
a few patients in some studies had difficulty swallowing 
it [105,110,111]. Capsule endoscopy may have a role in cases 
of patient refusal or contraindications for EGD and may 
also improve compliance with endoscopic follow up, but 
the accuracy of the method remains moderate, despite the 
advances in the capsule technology. String capsule endoscopy 
needs to be further evaluated as it holds the potential to yield 
higher accuracy rates.
Discussion
The role of non-invasive parameters in the detection of 
esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients has drawn much 
attention in recent years. Many studies have been conducted: 
the most recent meta-analyses are presented in Table 1.
In patients with compensated advanced chronic liver 
disease, the combination of liver stiffness and platelet count 
is used to rule out varices, as proposed by BAVENO VI 
guidelines. This is a great achievement that can reduce the cost 
and make surveillance for varices less stressful for the patients.
Although the combination of liver stiffness and platelet 
count, as proposed by the Baveno VI guidelines, is a highly 
sensitive test for the detection of esophageal varices, it has limited 
specificity. Further validation with large-scale prospective 
studies could also be useful. Furthermore, one method or a 
combination of methods that could reach a negative predictive 
value of almost 100% would further increase clinicians’ trust 
in these methods. Promising data were presented in a recent 
study by Augustin et al [112]; however, more data are needed 
to validate these results. A test that provided better specificity 
than the combination of liver stiffness and platelet count would 
allow EGD to be avoided in larger groups of patients.
The combination of spleen elastography with platelet count 
appears to be a reasonable choice, considering that spleen 
elastography has proven to have better accuracy compared 
to liver elastography in most studies that compared the two 
methods. If combined with liver elastography and spleen size, 
its accuracy could be further increased. The new elastography 
techniques (SWE, ARFI) may help further amplify the 
diagnostic value of elastography in either liver or spleen.
CT is the only imaging method that allows satisfactory direct 
visualization of esophageal varices. Although its accuracy in 
the detection of small varices is suboptimal, it is very precise in 
the detection of large varices and could be useful in patients not 
willing to undergo EGD. Stratification of patients according to 
FibroScan, platelet count and CT could help further increase 
sensitivity and specificity for the detection of varices; more 
studies in this direction are needed, considering that CT has 
not been combined with other tests until now. The ability of CT 
to detect early HCC could render it a valuable tool in the future 
for the surveillance of certain groups of cirrhotic patients. It

is essential to underline the diagnostic capacity of CT for the 
detection of varices. Radiologists should report on the presence 
of varices in CT examinations of cirrhotic patients, even when 
performed for other reasons.
Capsule endoscopy, considering the advances in imaging 
technology, may serve as an alternative to patients who refuse 
to undergo a gastroduodenoscopy. However, it is an expensive 
method, relatively invasive, and its reported accuracy is not yet 
satisfactory.
Doppler ultrasonography has not shown encouraging results 
so far in the detection of varices and appears to be less accurate 
and more time-consuming than elastography. However, a 
recent study that evaluated the cost-effectiveness and the 
benefits of two-dimensional ultrasound for the detection of 
esophageal varices has shown that this technique could be a 
helpful, simple, and portable tool, saving time and money, and 
can be used routinely to screen esophageal abnormalities [113].
A recent study evaluated the development of risk prediction 
models for the detection of varices, based on non-invasive 
techniques applied in compensated cirrhotic patients [31]. The 
study showed that the liver stiffness to spleen/platelet score 
(LSPS) had high discrimination, but none of the non-invasive 
techniques identified patients with very low risk of all-size 
varices. However, both LSPS and a model that combined TE 
and platelet count identified patients with very low risk of 
varices needing treatment [31].
Emerging techniques that have not yet been adequately 
evaluated, but whose first results seem to be very promising, 
are diffusion-weighted imaging on MRI, calculating the ADC 
value in the spleen, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. In 
particular, diffusion-weighted imaging is a single sequence 
on MRI, fast to perform, and without requiring intravenous 
contrast. Validation of the first promising results is needed and 
the combination of this method with other parameters, such as 
platelet count, needs to be considered.
Concluding remarks
Non-invasive methods, and specifically elastography, have 
provided alternatives for the surveillance of certain cirrhotic 
populations and there is evidence to support the Baveno VI 
guidelines and to avoid screening EGD in large groups of 
cirrhotic patients. However, this is an area that could still 
benefit from further research. Ideally, EGD in the future will 
be reserved mainly for therapeutic purposes; although this 
appeared unrealistic a few years ago, advances in technology 
and more prospective studies could make it feasible.
