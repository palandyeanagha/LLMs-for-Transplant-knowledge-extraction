ABSTRACT
Hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism is a rare etiology
for acute pancreatitis, oscillating between 1.5 and 7% in the dif￾ferent series. Although the cause-effect relationship and the
pathophysiology of the condition are not clear, it seems that the
association among them is not incidental, and serum calcium
could be a major risk factor, so that pancreatitis would come to
occur during severe hypercalcemia attacks. Mutations in different
genes have been proposed as well to justify why only some pa￾tients with primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia devel￾op acute pancreatitis.
References to cases like these ones are rare in the literature.
We report two patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hy￾perparathyroidism and hypercalcemia, one of them with a fatal
outcome.
Key words: Acute pancreatitis. Hypercalcemia. Hyperparathy￾roidism.

INTRODUCTION
Acute pancreatitis may have a great variety of etiolo￾gies. It is accepted that alcohol consumption and biliary
lithiasis are responsible for almost 80-90% of all cases.
Other, much more infrequent causes include toxics or
drugs, neoplastic obstruction of the bile tract or the
sphincter of Oddi, metabolic disorders such as hyper￾triglyceridemia or hypercalcemia, trauma, ischemia, in￾fection, autoimmune diseases, etc. Up to 10% of cases
are described as idiopathic pancreatitis because no main
cause of the disease could be established.
Patients with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia
present with an increased risk of suffering acute pancre￾atitis, about 10 times above that of the general popula￾tion. Nevertheless, pancreatic disease is a rare complica￾tion in these patients (approximately 2%). Elevated
serum calcium levels associated with different mutations
in several genes could be responsible for this predisposi￾tion in some patients with hyperparathyroidism. In this
respect some studies have been already carried out with
the SPINK1 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1),
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regu￾lator), and CASR (calcium-sensing receptor) genes.
Although an association between these entities has
been widely described and several theories about their
pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed, refer￾ences in the medical literature to cases of acute pancreati￾tis associated with hyperparathyroidism and hypercal￾cemia are few. Acute pancreatitis episodes are commonly
seen in patients already diagnosed with hyperparathy￾roidism, or immediately after parathyroidectomy, but it is
exceptional as a first manifestation of hyperparathy￾roidism. We herein report two cases that, with no other
intercurrent conditions, had acute pancreatitis with no
other relevant changes except for elevated serum calcium
levels secondary to previously unknown primary hyper￾parathyroidism.
CASE REPORT 1

about 10 cigarettes per day with no other toxic use, and
was not on chronic treatment.
He had also been admitted to hospital three times for
abdominal pain with high serum amylase, whereupon he
was diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis. A study was
carried out by his gastroenterologist, which only intermit￾tently found serum calcium levels near to upper limits of
normality (normal range: 8.4-10.4 mg/dl). It is also re￾markable that serum calcium levels were always normal
during previous acute pancreatitis events.
He is admitted again to our hospital for continuous ab￾dominal pain in the epigastrium accompanied by nausea
and vomiting. In the first study we found:
—Hemoglobin: 13.8 g/dl; hematocrit: 40%.
—White blood count: 13,400 (81% neutrophils).
—Glucose: 99 mg/dl; urea: 33 mg/dl; creatinine: 1.03
mg/dl.
—Serum amylase: 1980 U/L; lipase: 630 U/L.
—Cholesterol: 210 mg/dl; triglycerides: 98 mg/dl.
—Total protein: 7.1 g/dl; albumin: 4.5 g/dl.
—Serum calcium: 11.7 mg/dl.
He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, and abdom￾inal ultrasounds and endoscopic ultrasonography scans
were carried out. These were both normal, with no lithia￾sis, microlithiasis, or other biliary alterations. An abdom￾inal CT scan showed an edematous, unstructured pan￾creas with no other findings.
As all these explorations were negative, elevated
serum calcium levels were proposed as a potential etiolo￾gy for this disease. New serum calcium and intact
parathyroid hormone (iPTH) measurements were ob￾tained: serum calcium: 11.9 mg/dl; iPTH: 451 pg/ml
(normal < 9 pg/ml). Hypercalcemia due to hyperparathy￾roidism was thus confirmed.
The patient improved in the following days, with amy￾lase and lipase levels back to normal, correct oral feed￾ing, and no abdominal pain. When the disease had disap￾peared completely a 99mTc-Sestamibi scintigram was
performed, which found lower uptake consistent with a
right-side parathyroid adenoma. Some days later the pa￾tient underwent surgery for the excision of this tumor.
During the procedure, immediately after parathyroidecto￾my, a significant decrease in iPTH levels was confirmed.
Afterwards, a histological study of the surgical piece con￾firmed that the mass was a parathyroid adenoma.
After surgery serum calcium went back to normal, and
the patient had no more episodes of abdominal pain dur￾ing follow-up.
CASE REPORT 2
This was a 73-year-old diabetic male with hyperten￾sion who was on no drugs. He reported no toxic or drug
usage. Two years ago he had been admitted to hospital
because of toxic hepatitis from amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Since then, he was being followed up by a gastroenterol￾ogist, and had shown elevated serum calcium in several
blood tests. No etiology for hypercalcemia was ever con￾firmed.
This time he was admitted to our hospital because of
idiopathic acute pancreatitis with epigastric pain, nausea
and vomiting, and significantly elevated amylase and li￾pase levels, with no other lab or imaging findings. His
clinical course was favorable during the first few days --
abdominal pain and vomiting subsided, and oral feeding
was restored. Nevertheless, his clinical status suddenly
worsened, with abdominal pain and progressive con￾sciousness deterioration. A progressive increase in serum
calcium, which reached 15.5 mg/dl (normal: 8.4-10.4
mg/dl), and iPTH levels at 311.2 pg/ml (normal: < 9
pg/ml) were also seen. A cervical sonogram was carried
out, and a cystic tumor adjacent to the left thyroid lobe
was found.
The patient was admitted to the ICU and did poorly the
following days. Serum calcium could not be taken back
to normal levels in spite of intensive medical treatment.
iPTH reached 1900 pg/ml. He was operated on for the ex￾cision of a node located in upper left parathyroid gland.
Immediately after surgery iPTH decreased to 324.7
pg/ml, and returned to normal in the following hours, as
did serum calcium. Despite these changes and the med￾ical procedures performed, the patient developed severe
metabolic acidosis and a refractory shock, and died from
asystolia with no response to cardiopulmonary resuscita￾tion.
DISCUSSION
Unknown hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia is a
rare cause of acute pancreatitis that represents around
1.5-7% of all pancreatitis cases. There is no clear patho￾physiological basis, but the relationship between acute
pancreatitis and primary hyperparathyroidism seems not
casual, and high serum calcium levels may be the main
risk factor for developing acute pancreatitis in this con￾text. So, there seems to be a direct effect of calcium lev￾els on the severity of pancreatic disease. Hypercalcemia
would be responsible for an activation of pancreatic en￾zymes through acid lysosomal hydrolases, which play a
decisive role in this process.
It is very important that hypercalcemia be treated ex￾tensively in these patients, and its origin should be found
early. Management must be carried out in intensive care
units because of the severity of this disease, and it is de￾sirable that gastroenterologists and endocrinologists also
participate. Definitive treatment consists of surgically ex￾cising the responsible parathyroid adenoma.
Although patients with hypercalcemia due to primary
hyperparathyroidism are more at risk of acute pancreati￾tis than the general population (about ten times more),

this association is relatively infrequent. There are several
theories involving genes such as SPINK1 (serine pro￾tease inhibitor Kazal type 1) or CFTR (cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator). Some authors
support the possibility that mutations on these genes may
facilitate the development of this disease in situations of
intense hypercalcemia. Studies are ongoing on other
genes such as CASR (calcium-sensing receptor), but their
role in this process is not clear yet.
CONCLUSION
In acute pancreatitis associated with hypercalcemia
primary hyperparathyroidism should be suspected. Com￾plementary explorations such as serum calcium and in￾tact parathyroid hormone levels, and imaging techniques
such as cervical ultrasounds, computed tomography and
scintigraphy using 99mTc-Sestamibi, should be ordered,
which will lead to confirm clinical suspicion and defini￾tive surgical treatment.

RESUMEN
La hipercalcemia secundaria a hiperparatiroidismo es una cau￾sa rara de pancreatitis aguda, variando entre el 1,5-7% según las
series consultadas. Aunque la relación causal y la fisiopatología del
proceso no están totalmente aclaradas, parece claro que la asocia￾ción no es incidental y que los niveles de calcio sérico serían un
factor de riesgo mayor, desencadenándose los cuadros de pan￾creatitis durante las crisis de hipercalcemia. También se han des￾crito alteraciones en diversos genes que podrían estar implicados,
justificando por qué sólo unos pocos pacientes con hiperparatiroi￾dismo primario e hipercalcemia sufren pancreatitis aguda.
Existen muy pocas referencias en la literatura a casos como los
que nos ocupan. Presentamos a continuación dos pacientes con
cuadros de pancreatitis aguda asociados a hiperparatiroidismo e
hipercalcemia, uno de ellos con desenlace fatal.
Palabras clave: Pancreatitis aguda. Hipercalcemia. Hiperparati￾roidismo primario.
INTRODUCCIÓN
La pancreatitis aguda es un cuadro que puede presen￾tar gran variedad de etiologías. Se acepta que el alcohol y
la patología litiásica de la vía biliar están detrás de entre
el 80-90% de los casos. Otras causas más raras pero posi￾bles son tóxicos o drogas, obstrucciones neoplásicas de la
vía biliar o del esfínter de Oddi, alteraciones metabólicas
