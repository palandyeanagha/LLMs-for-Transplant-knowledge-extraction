Apoptosis in ischemic heart disease
Elena Teringova and Petr Tousek*
Abstract
Apoptosis plays an important role in the myocardial loss after acute myocardial infarction and participates in the 
process of subsequent left ventricular remodeling and development of symptomatic heart failure. Finding a sensitive 
apoptotic marker that would help in prognostic stratification of patients after acute myocardial infarction and offer 
new therapeutic strategies is thus of a great importance. Several studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor-related 
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) represents a very promising marker of prognosis in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction. This review article provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of apoptosis in ischemic heart 
disease and highlights potentially beneficial apoptotic markers in clinical practice.

Background
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of death 
worldwide. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the 
most common first manifestation of IHD and represents 
a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In the past dec￾ades, treatment of patients with AMI has significantly 
improved. However, more patients subsequently suffer 
from left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure 
[1]. Although necrosis was thought to be the sole cause 
of death in myocardial infarction for a long time, recent 
studies provide growing evidence that apoptosis plays an 
important role in the process of myocyte loss after AMI, 
as well as in the process of LV remodeling and develop￾ment of heart failure [2]. Recognizing a sensitive apop￾totic marker that would help define high-risk patients 
after AMI and offer new therapeutic strategies is thus of 
a great importance. Inhibition of apoptosis through anti￾apoptotic therapy could represent a new way forward 
to improve prognosis of these patients. The aim of this 
article is to discuss the role of known apoptotic mark￾ers in IHD and highlight their potential benefit in clinical 
practice.
Main text
Role of apoptosis in ischemic heart disease
Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, represents 
a highly regulated and energy-requiring process by which 
activation of specific signaling cascades leads to a cell 
death [3]. Apoptosis plays an important role in various 
physiological processes including embryogenesis, normal 
tissue homeostasis and aging [4–6]. However, excessive 
or insufficient apoptosis results in many diseases, includ￾ing cancer, some infectious, autoimmune and neurologi￾cal diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, 
Huntington’s disease) [7–13].
Several recent studies have also demonstrated an 
important role of apoptosis in ischemic heart disease. 
Apoptosis significantly contributes to myocyte cell death 
in AMI and occurs predominantly in the peri-infarcted 
region [14, 15]. High grade of apoptosis is present also 
at the subacute phase of MI [16] and correlates with 
parameters of progressive LV remodeling [2, 17]. More￾over, patients who developed symptomatic heart fail￾ure shortly after AMI were associated with significantly 
increased apoptotic rates [2]. Thus apoptosis is shown to 
play an important role in determining infarct size, extent 
of LV remodeling and development of early symptomatic 
heart failure after AMI.
Apoptotic markers in ischemic heart disease
Apoptosis can be initiated through two main pathways: 
the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic

or mitochondrial pathway. Both pathways converge on 
the same terminal pathway. Markers of apoptosis will be 
introduced thereinafter according to the pathway they 
are involved in.
Apoptotic markers of death receptor pathway
Death receptor pathway is significantly involved in 
inducing myocardial apoptosis in IHD. The mechanism 
of death receptor pathway has been extensively reviewed 
in the literature. Briefly, after an apoptotic ligand binds 
to its death receptor, death-inducing signaling complex is 
formed, resulting in caspase-8 activation [18]. Caspase-8 
activates effector caspases 3 and 7 and thus triggers the 
terminal phase of the apoptotic cascade (Fig. 1).
Fas
In experimental studies, apoptosis-stimulating fragment 
(Fas) is described as a critical mediator of cardiomyocyte 
apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [19]. 
However, levels of soluble Fas receptor (sFas) and Fas 
ligand (FasL) measured in patients with different forms 
of IHD provided rather controversial results. Levels of 
sFas were significantly higher in patients with acute MI 
compared to healthy controls or patients with chronic 
ischemic heart disease. However, sFas levels failed to 
correlate with the infarct size. Moreover, no difference 
was found in serum levels of Fas ligand among patients 
with acute MI, chronic forms of IHD or healthy controls 
[20].
In the study by Fertin et al. levels of FasL were meas￾ured in patients 1 month after MI and several echocar￾diographic studies were performed up to 1-year post 
MI to evaluate LV volumes. LV remodeling was docu￾mented by a significant increase of LV volumes; how￾ever, changes in LV volumes were not associated with 
FasL levels [21].
Similar findings were documented by Nilsson et  al. 
who measured levels of both sFas and sFasL in patients 
with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) prior 
to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 24  h 
after the procedure. Cardiac MRI was used to evaluate 
infarct size and LV dysfunction 5 days and 4 months after 
STEMI. No correlation was found between sFas or FasL 
and infarct size or LV dysfunction [22].

Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of apoptotic signaling pathway. Apoptosis can be induced by the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic 
or mitochondrial pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated after an apoptotic ligand (e.g. FasL, TNF-α, TRAIL) binds to its death receptor. Sub￾sequently, death-inducing signaling complex is formed resulting in caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 activates effector caspases and triggers the 
terminal phase of the apoptotic cascade. The intrinsic pathway is initiated through wide range of none-receptor mediated stimuli (e.g. deprivation 
of growth factors, hypoxia, oxidative stress), resulting in changes of the mitochondrial membrane permeability. After its release from mitochondria, 
cytochrome c together with Apaf-1 and procaspases-9 forms an apoptosome, resulting in caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9 then activates effector 
caspases, such as caspase-3. AIF and EndoG are also released from mitochondria and translocate to cell nucleus where they cause DNA fragmenta￾tion, independently of caspase activation. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge on the same terminal pathway

In line with this, serum levels of sFas measured in 
patients with acute coronary syndromes were not associ￾ated with patient prognosis during 6-month follow-up [23].
In conclusion, sFas levels are significantly higher in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction but failed to 
correlate with the infarct size, LV dysfunction, or prog￾nosis. Thus the role of Fas-mediated apoptosis in IHD is 
yet unclear.
However, sFas levels seem to be helpful as a prognos￾tic marker in patients with various forms of heart failure. 
Prognostic value of sFas was demonstrated in patients 
with dilated cardiomyopathy, decompensated heart fail￾ure, as well as in patients with compensated heart fail￾ure [24–26]. Higher sFas concentrations were associated 
with higher risk of mortality or hospitalization for heart 
failure.
TNF‑α
Experimental studies also demonstrate an important 
role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in mediating 
apoptosis of cardiomyocytes during I/R. TNF-α is a pro￾inflammatory cytokine with various biological functions. 
After binding to its receptor, TNF-α can induce apoptosis 
in cardiomyocytes, as shown in an in vitro rat study [27]. 
TNF-α shows dual effect in the heart depending on its 
concentration and on the type of its receptor. Low dose 
of TNF-α improves myocardial function while high dose 
of TNF-α increases myocardial injury following ischemia 
and reperfusion [28]. In an in vivo murine model of myo￾cardial infarction, TNF-α showed its cardiotoxic effect 
through receptor TNFR1 and cardioprotective effect 
through TNFR2. Mice lacking TNFR2 demonstrated 
worse post-IM survival, more severe ventricular dysfunc￾tion, and exacerbated myocyte hypertrophy and inter￾stitial fibrosis in non-infarct myocardium—compared to 
TNFR1-knockout mice [29].
Studies in heart failure patients demonstrate that high 
levels of TNF-α are expressed within failing human myo￾cardium, suggesting its role in the progression of heart 
failure [30, 31]. However, anti-TNF-α clinical trials using 
TNF-α antagonist or TNF-α antibody showed no benefit 
to patients with heart failure [32, 33]. These disappoint￾ing results support the presumption of ambivalent effects 
of TNF-α in the cardiovascular system.
Levels of TNF-α and its receptors are elevated also in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction and can predict 
infarct size, LV dysfunction and prognosis [22, 34, 35]. A 
study by Kehmeier et al. showed that TNF-α levels meas￾ured in STEMI patients after PCI can predict infarct size 
[34]. Nilsson et  al. measured soluble TNF-receptors in 
STEMI patients prior to and 24 h after PCI and showed 
that concentrations of TNFR1 and TNFR2 are associated 
with infarct size and LV dysfunction [22].
TNFR1 has proven to have a prognostic value in 
patients after acute myocardial infarction. Valgimigli 
et  al. show that plasma levels of soluble TNFR1 are a 
predictor of mortality and new onset of heart failure in 
patients with AMI [36]. Ueland et  al. demonstrate that 
levels of sTNFR1 can predict all-cause mortality and car￾diovascular death in patients who developed heart failure 
after AMI [37].
Other studies suggest that also TNF-α has a prognostic 
value in patients with AMI [38–40]. However, a clinical 
trial with TNF-α antagonist in patients with acute myo￾cardial infarction provided no evidence of immediate 
beneficial effect for these patients [41].
These findings suggest that involvement of TNF-α in 
ischemic heart disease is very complex and includes a 
wide range of biological processes—both harmful and 
beneficial. Further research is needed to clarify the exact 
molecular mechanism of TNF-α in IHD and find possible 
ways to inhibit only the negative TNF-α effects.
Since TNF-α is involved in IHD pathological pathway, 
TNF-α gene polymorphisms and their association with 
the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery 
disease (CAD) have been extensively studied. A meta￾analysis investigating relationship between TNF-α gene 
polymorphisms and CAD risk, however, showed no asso￾ciation [42].
TRAIL
TNF-related apoptosis stimulating ligand (TRAIL) is a 
member of TNF superfamily that can induce apoptosis. 
After binding to its receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, 
TRAIL initiates intracellular signaling cascade resulting 
in the apoptotic cell death [43, 44]. In an I/R model in iso￾lated rat and mouse hearts, TRAIL was released from the 
postischemic hearts early after the onset of reperfusion 
[45]. However, the exact molecular mechanism of TRAIL 
has not yet been completely understood. Some experi￾mental data suggest that TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 can 
also mediate cell type-dependent prosurvival and prolif￾eration signals [46]. In experimental studies, administra￾tion of soluble recombinant TRAIL showed protective 
activity. In a diabetic mouse model, direct administra￾tion of TRAIL reduced development of cardiomyopathy 
[47]. Another similar study demonstrated that systemic 
TRAIL delivery showed anti-atherosclerotic activity in 
diabetic mice [48].
Several clinical studies report that levels of TRAIL are 
decreased in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
[23, 49, 50]. Moreover, TRAIL is reported to be a poten￾tial marker of severity of coronary artery disease and 
predictor of prognosis in patients after acute myocardial 
infarction. Mori et  al. measured serum TRAIL levels in 
patients undergoing coronary angiography. TRAIL levels 

Teringova and Tousek J Transl Med (2017) 15:87 Page 4 of 7
were significantly lower in patients with coronary artery 
disease compared to those without. Moreover, TRAIL 
levels were inversely associated with the severity of CAD, 
suggesting potential use of TRAIL as a marker of CAD 
severity [49].
Secchierro et  al. measured TRAIL in patients with 
acute myocardial infarction in serial serum samples dur￾ing hospitalization and in a 12 month-follow-up. Serum 
levels of TRAIL were significantly decreased in AMI 
patients at baseline (compared to healthy controls) and 
low TRAIL levels at patient discharge were associated 
with increased incidence of cardiac death and heart fail￾ure at the 12-month follow-up, even after adjustment 
for demographic and clinical risk parameters. Thus low 
TRAIL levels represent a potential predictor of cardio￾vascular events following acute myocardial infarction 
[50].
A study by Osmancik et  al. provided similar findings. 
TRAIL levels were measured in acute coronary syndrome 
patients, who were then followed for 6  months. Low 
serum TRAIL concentrations were the strongest signifi￾cant and independent predictor of the composite end￾point of death and hospitalization for heart failure [23].
Low TRAIL levels can predict worse prognosis also in 
patients with chronic heart failure and in older patients 
with cardiovascular disease [25, 51].
In conclusion, serum TRAIL levels seem to represent 
an important predictor of prognosis in patients with 
acute myocardial infarction. Low TRAIL levels are asso￾ciated with worse prognosis of AMI patients while higher 
TRAIL levels seem to be protective. It is unclear whether 
decreased TRAIL levels reflect reduced production or 
increased consumption. Metalloproteinase 2, which level 
is elevated in patients with acute coronary syndromes, 
can cleave TRAIL, as shown in an in vitro study [52]. This 
could be a potential explanation of decreased TRAIL 
level in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Bet￾ter understanding of the exact molecular mechanism of 
TRAIL might provide a new target for therapeutic inter￾vention in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
Apoptotic markers of mitochondrial pathway
The intracellular signaling cascade of mitochondrial 
pathway is shown in Fig. 1. Activation of mitochondrial 
pathway and release of pro-apoptotic proteins from 
mitochondria into the cytosol is controlled and regulated 
by Bcl-2 family of proteins [53].
Bcl‑2
Experimental studies show that cardiac specific overex￾pression of Bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis, significantly 
reduces infarct size after I/R injury. This reduction of I/R 
injury correlates with the reduction of cardiomyocyte 
apoptosis [54, 55]. Expression of Bcl-2 was studied also in 
the hearts of patients who died of MI [56]. However, no 
clinical study was performed to examine level of Bcl-2 in 
serum of AIM patients. In cancer patients, evaluation of 
Bcl-2 serum levels and its tissue expression showed cor￾relation bordering on statistical significance [57].
Apoptotic markers of terminal pathway
Terminal apoptotic pathway is common for both extrin￾sic and intrinsic pathway. Activation of execution cas￾pases results in degradation of cellular constituents. This 
is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that 
are quickly removed by phagocytes [58].
Caspase‑3
The most important caspase of the terminal apoptotic 
pathway is caspase-3. Overexpression of cardiac specific 
caspase-3 in transgenic mice showed increased infarct 
size and pronounced susceptibility to die after I/R injury 
[59]. Vice versa, downregulation of caspase-3 decreased 
the infarct size, lowered the apoptotic index of myocytes 
and improved the heart function in an experimental 
model with myocardial infarction [60].
The cleaved caspase-3 p17 peptide was shown to 
escape from apoptotic cancer cells and was detectable 
in extracellular medium after induction of apoptosis, 
suggesting the concept that p17 peptide can escape 
also into circulation from apoptotic cells in patients. 
This presumption was used in a clinical study with 27 
STEMI patients undergoing PCI [61]. p17 peptide was 
measured within initial 24 h and 3 months after STEMI 
(88 ± 29 days). Compared to healthy subjects, peak p17 
levels were nearly fourfold higher in the acute phase 
of AMI and stayed significantly higher also in the late 
post-STEMI samples. However, the p17 peptide kinet￾ics and its correlation with the myocyte apoptosis after 
myocardial infarction have not yet been sufficiently 
examined.
Inhibition of apoptosis
Since apoptosis is significantly involved in myocardial 
injury after AMI, inhibition of apoptosis represents an 
appealing target for a therapeutic intervention.
TNF‑α inhibition therapy
TNF-α inhibition therapy was examined in large clinical 
trials with heart failure patients, using TNF-α antagonist 
infliximab or TNF-α antibody etanercept. Anti-TNF-α 
therapy, however, provided no evidence of clinical benefit 
to heart failure patients.
Two trials RECOVER and RENAISSANCE evalu￾ated a TNF-α antagonist etanercept in 2000 patients 
with chronic heart failure. Both trials were terminated 

Teringova and Tousek J Transl Med (2017) 15:87 Page 5 of 7
prematurely because etanercept failed to show clinically 
relevant benefit on the patient clinical status, the rate of 
death or hospitalization due to chronic heart failure [32].
ATTACH trial evaluated a TNF-α antibody inflixi￾mab in 150 patients with moderate-to-severe heart fail￾ure. Results showed that short-term inhibition of TNF-α 
with infliximab did not improve and high dose adversely 
affected the clinical condition of examined patients [33].
In patients with acute myocardial infarction, TNF-α 
antagonist etanercept was used in one trial with 26 
patients. Etanercept reduced systemic inflammation 
markers but increased platelet activation. TNF-α antag￾onism thus provided no evidence of immediate benefit 
for AMI patients [41]. Effect of anti-TNF-α therapy on 
diverse outcomes in AMI patients was not evaluated.
These findings suggest that involvement of TNF-α in 
the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and devel￾opment of heart failure includes various biological pro￾cesses and simple inhibition of all TNF-α effects does not 
provide clinical benefit to cardiac patients.
On the other hand, TNF-α inhibition therapy brought 
a revolution in the treatment of several autoimmune 
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and 
non-specific inflammatory bowel diseases. Clinical trials 
indicate that anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with psoria￾sis is associated with significantly decreased risk of myo￾cardial infarction, compared to treatment with topical 
agents [62, 63]. The risk of myocardial infarction is mark￾edly reduced also in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
who respond to anti-TNF-α therapy [64, 65].
TRAIL‑targeted therapy
No clinical trials have been done using TRAIL as a thera￾peutic target yet.
Conclusion
Apoptotic cell death represents a significant contributor 
to myocardial damage in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction and participates in the process of subsequent 
LV remodeling and development of heart failure. Find￾ing a sensitive marker of apoptosis that would help pre￾dict prognosis of AMI patients is of a great importance. 
Among intracellular apoptotic mediators, the only one 
evaluated in serum of patients with AMI is fragment 
of caspase-3 p17 peptide. Serum levels of p17 peptide 
brought some hopeful results in one study with STEMI 
patients; however, further research is needed to prove 
p17 peptide as a substantial marker of apoptosis. Among 
extracellular markers of apoptosis, several soluble forms 
of receptors and their ligands were evaluated in clinical 
studies with AMI patients. The most promising apop￾totic marker seems to be TRAIL. Serum TRAIL levels 
represent an important predictor of prognosis in AMI 
patients. Low TRAIL levels are associated with worse 
prognosis and high TRAIL levels seem to be beneficial. 
So far, it is unclear whether decreased TRAIL levels rep￾resent a reduced production or an increased consump￾tion. Deeper understanding of the exact molecular 
mechanism of TRAIL may offer a new target for thera￾peutic intervention in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction.
