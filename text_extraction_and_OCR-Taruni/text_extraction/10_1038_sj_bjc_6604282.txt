The aim of this study is to elucidate the prognostic factors and the treatment effect on survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
patients with Child C cirrhosis. Out of 3330 newly discovered HCC patients, 157 consecutive HCC individuals with Child C cirrhosis
were enrolled. The prognostic factors were examined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and their survival was
compared by propensity score-matched analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that high serum bilirubin (43 mg dl1
), the presence
of uncontrollable ascites, and a high platelet count (48  104 mm3
), so-called background liver factors, as well as multiple tumours,
large tumours (43 cm), high alpha-fetoprotein (4400 ng ml1
), and the presence of portal vein thrombus, so-called tumour factors,
were factors of poor prognosis. While transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) was a factor of good prognosis (relative
risk ¼ 0.50, 95%CI ¼ 0.27 – 0.89, P ¼ 0.019), local ablation therapy and transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion (TAI) were not significant
prognostic factors. The survival of patients who received TACE was superior to matched patients without active treatment
(P ¼ 0.009); however, we did not observe survival benefit after local ablation therapy or TAI. These results suggested that tumour
factors as well as background liver factors are prognostic factors of HCC even in patients with Child C cirrhosis, and selective use of
TACE in these patients provides survival benefit.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth cause of death by
cancer worldwide (Parkin, 2001). Many symptomatic HCCs are
diagnosed in advanced stage and cannot be treated, so the
prognosis is generally poor (Wong et al, 2000; Bruix and Llovet,
2002). By the accumulation of knowledge of the risk factors and the
prevalence of HCC surveillance, the proportion of HCC diagnosed
in early stage and that can be treated by local ablation therapies or
surgery has increased (Bolondi, 2003; Adams et al, 2004; Trevisani
et al, 2004).
In spite of the early detection of HCC, many patients die of
complications of severe cirrhosis without any active treatment
(Ikai et al, 2007). According to the algorithms of the treatment of
HCC recommended by groups in Europe and Japan (Bruix et al,
2001; Llovet, 2005; Makuuchi and Kokudo, 2006), HCC patient
with Child C cirrhosis (Pugh et al, 1973) is a candidate for liver
transplantation or best supportive care (BSC). However, even
though HCC meets the Milan criteria, many patients do not receive
liver transplantation because of the shortage of donors or
advanced age (United Network for Organ Sharing, 2006). Although
there is regional variability, patients diagnosed with HCC in the
background of hepatitis C virus infection are usually elderly
(Parkin, 2001). In Japan, the mean age of patients is 66.6 years old
(Ikai et al, 2007); therefore, a large number of the patients are
outside the liver transplantation criteria and receive only BSC.
Local ablation therapies and transcatheter arterial chemoembo￾lisation (TACE) are known to be useful for HCC treatment with
preserved liver function (Llovet et al, 2003). Nevertheless, these
therapies for patients with Child C cirrhosis are not recommended
because of reported severe adverse events. However, there is lack
of knowledge on prognostic factors on the effectiveness of active
treatment, except liver transplantation, in HCC patients with Child
C cirrhosis (Llovet, 2005). Therefore, it is very important to
identify factors influencing outcomes of cirrhotic patients affected
by HCC who cannot be treated by liver transplantation.
In this study, we retrospectively examined the clinical course of
HCC patients with Child C cirrhosis and analysed their prognostic
factors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Between January 1996 and September 2006 among 3330 con￾secutive newly diagnosed HCC patients who were admitted to our
department and affiliated hospitals, 186 individuals had Child C
cirrhosis. Five patients were excluded because of a lack of clinical
data, 24 were excluded because they underwent liver transplanta￾tion, and the remaining patients (n ¼ 157) were enrolled in this

study. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for use of
their clinical data. The study protocol conformed to the ethical
guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration of
Helsinki, and was approved by the ethical committees of the
institutes.
Diagnosis
One hundred and forty-one patients were diagnosed as having
HCC by imaging modalities, such as angiography, computed
tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Diagnostic criteria for HCC via imaging was based on previous
reports of hyperattenuation at the arterial phase, hypoattenuation
at the portal phase in dynamic CT (section thickness ¼ 5 –8 mm)
or MRI, and tumour stain on angiography (Honda et al, 1993). The
remaining 16 patients with hepatic masses who did not satisfy
the above criteria underwent ultrasound (US)-guided fine-needle
biopsy with histologically confirmed HCC.
Treatments
As there is no clear evidence that active treatment of HCC
improves the survival of patients with Child C cirrhosis, all the
patients were informed that the potential treatment benefits were
unknown and the risks of the treatments were higher than in
patients with Child A/B cirrhosis. We conducted local ablation
therapy, TACE, or transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion (TAI) only
when patients consented to undergo these interventions. Percuta￾neous ethanol injection therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and
microwave coagulation therapy were performed in 18, 4, and 1
patients, respectively. All HCCs treated by local ablation therapy
were less than 3 cm in diameter and less than three tumours,
except three single large HCC with diameters between 3.0 and
3.5 cm. There are two major differences of our treatment algorithm
for patients with Child C cirrhosis from that for patients with Child
A/B cirrhosis. Surgical resection was not chosen and indication for
local ablation therapy was stricter. When a tumour protruded from
the liver surface, attached to the adjacent organs such as gall
bladder, or a tumour was not confirmed well by ultrasonography,
local ablation therapies were not performed. The therapies were
also avoided when uncontrollable ascites was present. We included
transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) in the group undergoing
TACE, because the number of patients who received TAE was
small and no clear difference in the treatment effect was reported
in previous studies (Camma et al, 2002). Transcatheter arterial
chemoembolisation was not chosen principally in cases of severe
portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT). Transcatheter arterial
chemoembolisation and TAI were performed supraselectively in
the most peripheral accessible feeding artery to avoid irreversible
liver failure. When the treatment might cause immediate
irreversible liver failure or severe complications, we did not
perform any active treatments irrespective of the patients’ wishes,
except emergency TACE for HCC rupture.
Follow-up
Biochemical liver function tests and US, dynamic CT, or MRI were
performed at least every 3 months after the treatment. Re￾treatment was performed depending on patients’ conditions,
tumour stage and background liver function, according to the
same clinical indications as for the first intervention.
Statistical analysis
The Kruskal –Wallis test was used to compare the continuous data
and the w2 test was used to compare categorical data. Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyse the
prognostic factors. Factors exhibiting significant values in
univariate analysis and effect of the treatments were further
analysed by multivariate analysis. The propensity score of
choosing each treatment was calculated, followed by matching
each treatment group and BSC group according to a greedy
matching technique (Parsons, 2001). For calculation of the
propensity score, following variables (cutoffs) were used: total
bilirubin (o2, 2 –3, 43, mg per dl), tumour size (o20, 20 –30,
430, mm), tumour number (1, 41), PVTT (absent, present). The
survival of matched patients was compared by the Kaplan –Meyer
method and the differences were evaluated by the log-lank test.
SAS (version 9.1.3) and JMP (version 5.0.1) software packages
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) were used for analyses, and Po0.05
was considered significant. Bonferroni correction was used for
multiple comparisons of propensity score-matched analyses and
Po0.05/3 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristic of the patients
Twenty-three patients (14.7%) were treated by local ablation
therapy, 27 (17.2%) by TACE, and 19 (12.1%) by TAI. The
remaining patients (n ¼ 88, 56.1%) did not receive any of these
treatments (BSC group). One- and 3-year survival of patients was
42.6 and 14.0%, respectively.
The characteristics of all patients are reported in Table 1. There
was no difference in sex and age among these groups. The positive
rate of hepatitis C virus antibody was low (55.7%) in the BSC
group. Background liver function (Child-Pugh score) was worse
and the tumours were more advanced (tumour size, tumour
number, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and PVTT) in the BSC group
than in other groups. Eighteen patients could be re-treated by local
ablation therapies, TAE, or TAI.
Risk factors for survival of HCC patients with Child C
cirrhosis
Among 17 parameters and treatment modalities, high bilirubin
(43 mg dl1
), the presence of uncontrollable ascites, and a high
platelet count (48  104 mm3
), so-called background liver
factors, as well as multiple tumour number, large tumour
(43 cm), high AFP (4400 ng ml1
), and the presence of PVTT,
so-called tumour factors, were significant risk factors for death in
univariate analysis in Table 2. Conversely, TACE and local ablation
therapy were associated with better survival. As shown in Table 3,
multivariate analysis revealed that all background factors and
tumour factors that were significant in univariate analysis were
also significant risk factors. Regarding therapies, only TACE was
a significant negative risk factor for death by multivariate analysis.
Survival of patients in different therapeutic groups
One-year (3-year) survival of patients receiving local ablation
therapy, TACE, TAI, and BSC was 69.1 (41.3), 62.5 (29.8), 43.9
(12.6), and 27.7% (3.8%), respectively (Po0.001, Figure 1). To
estimate the effect of treatments, the clinical background of the
patients in each group was adjusted by propensity scores, and the
survival of treated groups was compared with the BSC group.
Numbers of the score-matched pairs were 25, 19, and 19 for TACE
vs BSC group, local ablation therapy vs BSC group, and TAI vs BSC
group, respectively. One patient in the BSC group for the
comparison with TACE group had a main portal vein thrombus.
While survival in the TACE group was significantly better than in
the BSC group (P ¼ 0.009, Figure 2), no differences in survival were
observed between the local ablation group and BSC group
(P ¼ 0.782, Figure 3), and between TAI group and BSC group
(P ¼ 0.237, Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
The prognosis of HCC patients with Child C cirrhosis is well
known to be poor; however, there is little information about the
prognostic factors among patients and the effect of active
treatment, except liver transplantation (Llovet, 2005). In this
study, we clearly demonstrated that high total bilirubin
(43 mg dl1
) and the presence of uncontrollable ascites, cate￾gorised as background liver factors, were independent factors for
poor prognosis in HCC patients with Child C cirrhosis. In addition,
tumour factors such as tumour size (43 cm), tumour number
(multiple), AFP (4400 ng ml1
), and PVTT were also independent
prognostic factors. These factors were quite similar to the reported
prognostic factors for HCC, which include chronic hepatitis and
Child A or B cirrhosis (Sala et al, 2005). High platelet count also
correlated with poor prognosis. Platelet is known to decrease
according to the advancement of cirrhosis. Therefore, it is possible

that the liver in patients with high platelet count is not cirrhotic
and the liver function is disturbed by very advanced HCC, which
can be a reason of poor prognosis. This explanation was
strengthened by a result in this study. The size of HCC in patients
with high platelet count was significantly larger than that in
patients with low platelet count (data not shown).
The contribution of tumour factors to HCC patients with Child
C cirrhosis indicated that HCC treatment might prolong survival
even though the patients suffered from Child C cirrhosis. The
results of multivariate analysis of the treatments and of propensity
score-matched survival curves support this hypothesis. The
relative risk for patients undergoing TACE was 0.50 and survival
of this group was better than that of BSC (P ¼ 0.009). Only two
patients died within a month and had been treated by TACE
because of HCC rupture (data not shown). Although TACE might
be an eligible method for the treatment of HCC with Child C
cirrhosis, the results do not indicate that TACE is effective in all
Child C patients. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation was
selected for patients without severe portal vein thrombus and with
relatively good liver function in this analysed population. The
medians of bilirubin and prothrombin time in TACE group were
1.9 mg dl1 and 64.2%, respectively.
While TACE showed a beneficial effect, local ablation therapy
did not prolong survival. One possible reason is that the
deterioration of liver function to death is much faster than tumour
progression. The reported 1-year local recurrence rate of HCC in
patients treated by local ablation therapy was low (2 –18%) (Lin
et al, 2005; Tateishi et al, 2006; Kim et al, 2006b), whereas the
1-year survival rate of Child C patients treated by local ablation
therapy was 69.1%, indicating that many patients died without
recurrence of HCC. Although no effect of local ablation therapy
was observed, therapy including RFA could be used for decom￾pensated liver cirrhosis (Kim et al, 2006a) and it is possible that it
might be beneficial in special circumstances, such as when minute
growth of the tumour immediately results in the occlusion of
major critical vessels.
Several studies have addressed the characters of HCC with
decompensated cirrhosis (Nagasue et al, 1999; Ueno et al, 2002;
Toyoda et al, 2005). Ueno et al (2002) reported that high albumin,
lack of oesophageal varices, small tumour, single tumour, and low
AFP were survival factors for HCC patients with decompensated
liver cirrhosis. The study included many Child B cirrhosis patients
(over 85%); however, the results were quite similar to our data with
Child C cirrhosis. Toyoda et al (2005) reported risk factors for HCC
patients with Child C cirrhosis and beneficial effect of treatment;
however, the study included old cases and details of the treatment
were not described. Regarding therapies, BSC was recommended for
the treatment of HCC with decompensated cirrhosis, except in
transplantation-eligible cases, by the algorithms of HCC treatment
demonstrated by groups in Europe and Japan (Bruix et al, 2001;
Llovet, 2005; Makuuchi and Kokudo, 2006), while there are several
reports indicating the usefulness or safety of operation, RFA, and
TACE for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (Nagasue
et al, 1999; Ueno et al, 2002; Kim et al, 2006a). Prospective
randomised study is the best method to know the benefit of these
therapies for HCC patients with Child C cirrhosis; however, it is
ethically difficult now because no clear evidence of the beneficial
effect of active treatments was reported and most of the guidelines
for the treatment of HCC did not recommend these therapies except
transplantation. Our study was a retrospective cohort study, the
patient groups were heterogenous and the number of patients in
each arm was quite limited; however, we clearly indicates the
possibility of adopting TACE for the treatment of HCC in patients
with Child C cirrhosis by both multivariate Cox proportional hazard
model and propensity score-matched analyses.
Recently, improvement of liver function in patients with
decompensated liver cirrhosis by anti-hepatitis virus therapy such
as lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil was reported (Hiraoka et al,

2005; Takamura et al, 2007). Adoption of these anti-viral therapies
can reduce patient mortality from liver failure so that the
treatment effect of local ablation therapy may improve, resulting
in increased candidates for active treatment of HCC with Child C
cirrhosis.
In this study, we demonstrated that tumour factors as well as
background liver factors were risk factors even in HCC patients
with Child C cirrhosis, and that TACE can be effective in a very
selected group of patients. A randomised controlled study is
needed to expand the eligible criteria for active treatment.
