Abstract
Background: Multilocus PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) is a new strategy for
pathogen identification, but information about its application in fungal identification remains sparse.
Methods: One-hundred and twelve strains and isolates of clinically important fungi and Prototheca species were subjected
to both rRNA gene sequencing and PCR/ESI-MS. Three regions of the rRNA gene were used as targets for sequencing: the 59
end of the large subunit rRNA gene (D1/D2 region), and the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2 regions).
Microbial identification (Micro ID), acquired by combining results of phenotypic methods and rRNA gene sequencing, was
used to evaluate the results of PCR/ESI-MS.
Results: For identification of yeasts and filamentous fungi, combined sequencing of the three regions had the best
performance (species-level identification rate of 93.8% and 81.8% respectively). The highest species-level identification rate
was achieved by sequencing of D1/D2 for yeasts (92.2%) and ITS2 for filamentous fungi (75.8%). The two Prototheca species
could be identified to species level by D1/D2 sequencing but not by ITS1 or ITS2. For the 102 strains and isolates within the
coverage of PCR/ESI-MS identification, 87.3% (89/102) achieved species-level identification, 100% (89/89) of which were
concordant to Micro ID on species/complex level. The species-level identification rates for yeasts and filamentous fungi were
93.9% (62/66) and 75% (27/36) respectively.
Conclusions: rRNA gene sequencing provides accurate identification information, with the best results obtained by a
combination of ITS1, ITS2 and D1/D2 sequencing. Our preliminary data indicated that PCR/ESI-MS method also provides a
rapid and accurate identification for many clinical relevant fungi.

Introduction
Over the past few decades, invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) have
become a big challenge to public health, especially in hospitalized
patients who are critically ill or immunocompromised. Despite
extraordinary development in antifungal drugs during these years,
the mortality of IFDs remains high [1,2]. As there are species￾specific differences in susceptibility to antifungal agents for many
pathogenic fungi, rapid and accurate identification of organisms to
species level is essential for the early initiation and optimal choice
of antifungal therapy. Optimal treatment is of importance to
reduce mortality [3,4]. In most routine diagnostic laboratories,
phenotypic identification is used, based on morphological and
biochemical analysis. Technical expertise and a great deal of time
are required for morphological identification, especially for some
less common species. Phenotypic methods have also long been
criticized for low accuracy and database limitations [5,6].
The development of molecular approaches has greatly facilitat￾ed the identification of fungal pathogens. Many molecular
identification methods have been established, such as PCR-based
sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP),
pyrosequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time
of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and multilocus
PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(PCR/ESI-MS) [7–9]. Among these methods, PCR amplification
followed by sequencing and pairwise alignment of amplicons has
been widely accepted as the ‘‘gold standard’’ for fungal
identification. PCR-based sequencing demonstrates better speci￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e98110

ficity and accuracy compared with traditional phenotypic methods
[10,11]. Because of sufficient intra-species conservation and inter￾species specificity, the 59 end of the large subunit rRNA gene (D1/
D2 region) and the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and
ITS2 regions) between 18 s and 28 s rRNA genes are most
frequently used as targets for sequencing [12–14]. Nonetheless,
this method has its limitations in the requirement for high quality
and quantity of DNA samples, and the poor performance in
characterizing mixtures of organisms [15].
PCR/ESI-MS which is performed on the commercialized
instrument PLEX-IDTM system (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des
Plaines, IL, USA) couples multilocus PCR amplification with
automated electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis and
accurately weighs the amplicons, or mixture of amplicons to
deduce the composition of A, G, C and T for each amplicon. By
comparing with a database of calculated base compositions
derived from sequences of reference strains, the base compositions
can provide pathogen identification [16,17]. The ability to
characterize mixtures of organisms, along with its short turn￾around time, and low DNA concentration requirement, makes it a
promising method in fungal identification. Several studies have
demonstrated its utilization in identification of microbes and
diagnosis of bloodstream infections [17,18]. It has been shown that
PCR/ESI-MS had good performance in identifying clinical
Candida isolates to species level [19,20]. However, data regarding
the ability of PCR/ESI-MS to identify other clinical relevant fungi
isolates are still insufficient [21,22].
In the present study, we used rRNA gene sequencing and PCR/
ESI-MS methods, as well as traditional phenotypic methods, to
identify a series of clinically relevant fungi including yeast and
filamentous fungi, and two Prototheca species. The results of
identification were compared among different methods, in an
effort to provide further evidence for the performance of these
methods in the identification of pathogenic fungi in clinical
settings.
Materials and Methods
Strains and isolates
A total of 112 fungal isolates were used in this study. Thirteen of
them were reference strains: Candida albicans (n = 1, ATCC 90028),
Candida parapsilosis (n = 1, ATCC 22019), Candida krusei (n = 1,
ATCC 6258) and Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 1, ATCC 10894) strains
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); Candida
dubliniensis (n = 1, RI0482), Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 2, molecular
type VN I and VN II), and Cryptococcus gattii (n = 2, molecular type
VG I and VG IV) strains from Centre for Infectious Diseases and
Microbiology, the University of Sydney; Aspergillus ustus (n = 1,
35377), Aspergillus versicolor (n = 1, 35379), Aspergillus flavipes (n = 1,
33921), and Aspergillus nidulans (n = 1, CNCGF129) strains from
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ninety-three were clinical isolates
cultured from various clinical specimens including blood, cere￾brospinal fluid (CSF), sputum, stool, liver mass, peritoneal dialysis
solution, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, oral secretion, nasal
secretion, lung tissue, eye, and wound. Six environmental isolates
cultured from roots, leaves or soil were also included. Clinical
relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including
Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Enterococcus
faecalis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), Streptococcus pneumoniae
(n = 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), as
well as whole blood sample (n = 1) from a healthy adult were
included as negative controls to assure the specificity of both
molecular identification methods.
Phenotypic identifications
The phenotypic identifications of all the isolates were performed
in the clinical mycology laboratory of Huashan Hospital, Fudan
University. Yeast species were identified by their colony morphol￾ogy and microscopic morphology on Sabouraud dextrose agar
(BD Biosciences, Cockeysville, MD, USA) and CHROMagar
Candida plates (BD Biosciences). Biochemical test by API 20C
AUX system (bioMe´rı´eux, Marcy I’Etoile, France) was used as
supplement for yeast identification. L-canavanine glycine bro￾mothymol blue (CGB) agar was used for the differentiation of C.
neoformans and C. gattii [23,24]. Identifications of filamentous fungi
were based on their colony morphology and microscopic
morphology on Sabouraud dextrose agar (BD Biosciences,
Cockeysville, MD, USA) and Czapek-Dox agar (Difco Laborato￾ries, Detroit, MI, USA).
Amplification and sequencing of the rRNA gene regions
The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA)
was used for extraction of fungal, bacterial and human genomic
DNA per the Qiagen Handbook’s protocol. Three pairs of fungus￾specific universal primers were used for amplification of the three
rRNA gene regions (ITS1, ITS2 and D1/D2) (Table 1) [25–27].
PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 25 mL
containing 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 U of
Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mM of each primer, 16 PCR buffer
and 3 mL of DNA template. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles
with 30 s of denaturation at 94uC, 30 s annealing at 61uC, and
1 min extension at 72uC, followed by a final extension cycle for
6 min at 72uC. The amplicons were sequenced using the ABI
3730 XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems/Hitachi, Foster
City, CA). Pairwise sequence alignment was performed in the
GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).
The criteria for judging the results of rRNA gene sequencing
and alignment were adopted from previous studies with modifi￾cation as follows [14,28]: A strain or isolate was assigned to species
level if the best matching reference species showed $98%
homology and the next best matching reference species showed
at least 0.8% less sequence homology. A strain or isolate was
assigned to genus level when there was 95% to 98% homology to
the best matching species, or when more than one sequence entry
of several species from the same genus showed of $98%
homology. ‘‘No identification (NI)’’ was defined as,95% homol￾ogy with the best matching reference species, or when there was
homology of .95% with multiple sequences of various genera. For
each strain and isolate, a multiple rRNA gene sequencing
identification result was integrated from alignment results of
ITS1, ITS2 and D1/D2 as follows: species-level identification was
defined when any of the three regions sequencing yielded species￾level identification and results by the other regions were of the
same species, genus, or NI result; genus level identification was
defined when different species but the same genus were indicated
by the three regions, or when one of them resulted in genus level
identification while the remaining two showed NI result; NI was
defined when all the three sequencings yielded NI results or when
the results disagreed on genus level.
Assignment of Micro ID
In order to provide a relative standard for further evaluation of
results from PCR/ESI-MS, a microbial identification (Micro ID)
for each strain and isolate in this study was predefined on the basis
of results from both the phenotypic identification and rRNA gene
sequencing [29]. For strains or isolates with consistent results
between the phenotypic identification and rRNA gene sequencing,
the Micro ID was the consensus result. For strains or isolates with
Fungi Identification by Sequencing and PCR/ESI-MS
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e98110

inconsistent results between them, the Micro ID was defined
primarily based on rRNA gene sequencing. Phenotype was
considered supplemental to rRNA gene sequencing in cases where
related species could not be differentiated by ITS or D1/D2
sequencing.
PCR/ESI-MS analysis
Multilocus PCR for ESI-MS was performed with broad fungal
assay plate (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL, USA). There
were 16 primer pairs in the kit with large subunit (LSU) rRNA,
small subunit (SSU) rRNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) SSU,
mtDNA cytochrome B (cyt B), and b-tubulin genes as molecular
targets, among which eight targeted broad-range fungi, seven were
species or genus specific, and one served as extraction control
(Table 2). The following conditions were used for PCR on a 96-
well Thermal Cyclers (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany): 95uC for
10 min, followed by 8 cycles of 95uC for 30 s, 48uC for 30 s
(increasing 0.9uC each cycle), and 72uC for 30 s. The PCR was
then continued for 37 additional cycles of 95uC for 15 s, 56uC for
20 s, and 72uC for 20 s. The cycle ended with a final extension of
2 min at 72uC, 99uC for 20 min, and then followed by a 4uC hold.
Amplicons and mixtures of amplicons (47 samples were prepared
in mixtures of 2–4 samples per reaction) were analyzed using the
Abbott PLEX-ID universal biosensor platform (Abbott Molecular
Inc, Des Plaines, IL, USA), which performed automated post-PCR
desalting, ESI-MS signal acquisition, spectral analysis, and data
reporting. Information such as the number of copies of DNA per
well, the number of primers making the identification, and the
base composition similarity between the reference and unknown
isolates were taken into account to determine the correlation. The
criteria for judgment of identification results were adopted from
previous studies with minor modification as follows [21,30]: A
strain or isolate was assigned to species level when the retrieved
loci showed $60% match with database signatures, with the best
matching reference species showed $0.90 correlation and the next
best matching reference species showed at least 0.1% less
correlation at the same time. A strain or isolate was assigned to
genus level when several matching species from the same genus
met the criteria above. ‘‘Fungi detected-no identification can be
provided’’ was defined as 50% to 60% database match. ‘‘No
detection (ND)’’ was reported for specimens whose best database
match was below 50% or when no fungus was detected.
Statistical analysis
Accuracy of identification assays was calculated as the
proportion of samples correctly identified by each of the methods.
Between-group comparisons were performed using chi-squared
test. A p-value (P) of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical
analysis.
Results
Identification of reference strains by phenotypic
methods and rRNA gene sequencing
Identification results of the 13 reference strains are shown in
Table 3. Phenotypic methods yielded species-level identification
for most of the strains, except one C. dubliniensis strain that was
identified as its closely related species C. albicans, and five Aspergillus
spp. strains that were identified to genus level. Sequencing of the
three rRNA gene regions yielded species-level identification for
most of the strains with a few exceptions. Two C. gattii strains were
identified to genus level because of high homology between C.
neoformans and C. gattii by sequencing of all the three regions. In
addition, one A. ustus strain was correctly identified to species level
by D1/D2 sequencing, but misidentified as other Aspergillus spp.
that belonged to the A. ustus complex by either ITS1 or ITS2
sequencing.
Identification of clinical and environmental isolates by
phenotypic methods and rRNA gene sequencing
In general, 73.7% (73/99) of the clinical/environmental isolates
were identified to species level by phenotypic methods. By
sequencing of the ITS1, ITS2, and D1/D2 region, 73.7% (73/
99), 79.8% (79/99), and 84.8% (84/99) were identified to species
level, respectively. For the 64 yeast isolates, the highest species￾level identification rate was yielded by D1/D2 sequencing (92.2%,
59/64), followed by phenotypic methods (89.1%, 57/64), ITS2
sequencing (84.4%, 54/64) and ITS1 sequencing (76.6%, 49/64).
For the 33 filamentous fungal isolates, the species-level identifica￾tion rate was highest by ITS2 sequencing (75.8%, 25/33), followed
by ITS1 sequencing (72.7%, 24/33), D1/D2 sequencing (69.7%,
23/33), and phenotypic methods (48.5%, 16/33). A combination
of ITS1 with ITS2 sequencing showed better performance than
either of the single locus sequence analysis, and produced species￾level identification rate of 89.1% (57/64) for yeasts and 81.8%
(27/33) for filamentous fungi isolates (data not shown). In addition,
two Prototheca zopfii isolates were identified to species level by D1/
D2 sequencing, to genus level by phenotypic methods, but could
not be identified by either ITS1 or ITS2 sequencing due to very
low query coverage or identity (Table 4).
Results of ITS1, ITS2, and D1/D2 sequencing were also
integrated into a multiple rRNA gene sequencing result as defined
in the methods section. When compared with results of sequencing
of each single region, multiple rRNA gene sequencing yielded the
best species-level identification (89.9%, 89/99), higher than ITS1
(73.7%, P = 0.003), ITS2 (79.8%, P = 0.047), and D1/D2 (84.8%,
P = 0.285) sequencing.
Among the 99 isolates, concordant identification results on
species level between rRNA gene sequencing and phenotypic
methods were achieved for 62.6% (62/99) of them. Inconsistent
results occurred for 37.4% (37/99) of them, including 32 isolates
with inconsistent species-level results but consistent complex/
genus level results, and 5 isolates with inconsistent results on genus
level (Table S1).
Micro IDs of reference strains and clinical/environmental
isolates
When assigning Micro IDs for strains and isolates, both rRNA
gene sequencing results and phenotypes were taken into consid￾eration. The sequencing results were prioritized for most of the

eight isolates including two Candida metapsilosis/Candida orthopsilosis/
C. parapsilosis isoltates, one Pichia guilliermondii/Pichia caribbica
isolate, one Trichosporon domesticum/Trichosporon montevideense isolate,
two A. versicolor/Aspergillus sydowii isolates, one A. flavus/A. oryzae
isolate and one Ulocladium spp. isolate.
Assessment of PCR/ESI-MS analysis
Based on Micro IDs, 91.1% (102/112) of the strains and
isolates, including 66 yeasts and 36 filamentous fungi, were within
the coverage of PCR/ESI-MS identification as per the database of
the broad fungal assay kit (Table S2). PCR/ESI-MS was able to
identify 87.3% (89/102) of them to species level with 100% (89/
89) consistency to their Micro IDs at species or species complex￾level (C. parapsilosis, C. metapsilosis, and C. orthopsilosis in C. parapsilosis
complex, P. guilliermondii and P. caribbica in P. guilliermondii complex,
A. versicolor and A. sydowii in A. versicolor complex). The species-level
identification rate for yeasts was 93.9% (62/66), higher than that
of filamentous fungi which was 75% (27/36). Genus level
identification was achieved for seven isolates of filamentous fungi,
four of which were identified as A. flavus/A. oryzae within the A.
flavus complex.
For the remaining 10 strains and isolates out of the coverage of
the broad fungal assay kit, six were identified to species or genus
level by PCR/ESI-MS, including two C. gattii strains as C.
neoformans, one Colletotrichum capsici strain as Colletotrichum boninense,
one Mucor irregularis isolate as Mucor racemosus, and one Pichia
anomala isolate as Pichia spp., all of which showed genus
concordance to their Micro IDs.
PCR amplifications of the three regions for negative control
samples all yielded negative results and PCR/ESI-MS analysis
detected no fungus for each of them (data not shown).
Discussion
The traditional phenotypic identification methods for patho￾genic fungal species are based on morphological and biochemical
characteristics of different species. Molecular approaches, espe￾cially sequence-based strategies which are being more and more
widely used show the potential to be a powerful supplement for the
phenotypic identification [11,17,32]. The ITS region is one of the
most frequently used targets for sequence-based identification. It is
located between the 18S and 28S rRNA gene and is divided into
ITS1 and ITS2 regions by the 5.8S rRNA gene. Both ITS1 and
ITS2 have important applications in sequence-based identifica￾tion. Several studies have shown that ITS2 displayed significant
interspecies variability to identify 99.7% of yeasts and 100% of
molds to species level, while ITS1 produced identification
accuracy of 96.8%–100% for yeasts and 100% for molds
[13,33]. Although ITS2 has been more frequently used for fungal
identification, ITS1 showed greater interspecies variability than
ITS2 region in another study [25]. A database specialized for
ITS1 based on pairwise alignment searches (http://itsonedb.ba.
itb.cnr.it:8080/ITS1/) has also been established. In our study,
ITS2 showed higher discrimination ability than ITS1 for yeasts,
and similar performance for filamentous fungi. Furthermore, a
combination of ITS1 with ITS2 sequencing showed better
performance than either single locus sequence alone. ITS1 plus
ITS2 is also preferred to be an appropriate region for one of the
taxonomic methods so called DNA-barcoding of fungi [34–36].
The D1/D2 region within the 26/28S large subunit rRNA gene
is another commonly used target for identification [27,37].
According to our study, D1/D2 sequencing yielded higher
identification accuracy than either ITS1 or ITS2 for yeasts, in
accordance with others [12]. Another study has shown that for

Fungi Identification by Sequencing and PCR/ESI-MS
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e98110

species-level identification of some Mucor spp. such as Mucor
ramosissimus, D1/D2 sequence analysis acquired higher identity
than either ITS1 or ITS2 [13]. Unlike DNA-barcoding, which
prefers using one standardized 500 to 800 bp sequence to identify
species of all fungal pathogens, our results revealed the highest
identification accuracy by combination of ITS1, ITS2 and D1/D2
sequencing for all the clinical relevant fungal pathogens we studied
[36].
Though it has been generally accepted that PCR-based
sequencing provides quicker and more accurate identification for
fungi, the traditional phenotype-based identification remains
indispensible. Phenotypes serve as essential supplements for some
species that share high homology in rRNA gene sequences. In our
study for example, C. neoformans and C. gattii were indistinguishable
by rRNA gene sequencing but identified to species by CGB
culture. Also two Aspergillus spp. isolates indistinguishable between
A. oryzae and A. flavus by rRNA gene sequencing were identified as
A. favus by morphological and cultural characteristics. Therefore, a
combination of phenotypic and rRNA gene sequencing identifi￾cation results would be better than any single one of them.
PCR/ESI-MS is a new strategy coupling broad-range PCR
amplification to automated electrospray ionization mass spec￾trometry analysis for identification and detection of pathogens.
Unlike MALDI-TOF MS, which performs the identification based
on species-specific protein masses, PCR/ESI-MS relies on
measurement of masses of nucleotides from PCR amplicons. In
this study, we assessed the identification value of PCR/ESI-MS for
various clinical relevant fungi and Prototheca spp. Regarding the
species within the coverage of the broad fungal assay kit, 93.9%
(62/66) of yeasts and 75% (27/36) of filamentous fungi were
identified to species level by PCR/ESI-MS, results of which were
100% concordant to Micro ID on species/species complex level.
One C. dubliniensis strain which is difficult to differentiate from C.
albicans by conventional phenotypic methods was accurately
identified by PCR/ESI-MS. For the identification of less common
fungi by PCR/ESI-MS, a recent study showed that most
Rhodotorula spp., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Fusarium spp., and
Scedosporium spp. could be identified to genus level [21]. While two
Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, four isolates of Rhizopus spp., two isolates of
Rhizomucor spp., two isolates of Fusarium spp., and two isolates of
Scedosporium spp. in our study were successfully identified to species
level. It was also noteworthy that in our study six out of ten strains
and isolates out of the coverage of the kit could be identified to
genus level concordant with Micro ID, indicating the potential
usefulness of the kit for detection of emergent or unknown fungal
pathogens.
The ability of PCR/ESI-MS to identify the filamentous fungi, as
shown in our study, seemed to be not as satisfactory as for the
yeasts. One of the possible explanations may be that the primers of
ITS1 and ITS2 regions were not included in this kit [36,38]. The
ITS regions seem to have a particular value in the identification of
filamentous fungi, as revealed by our results that either ITS1 or
ITS2, yielded higher identification accuracy than D1/D2.
Therefore, the inclusion of primers targeting ITS1 and ITS2
regions might possibly improve the performance of PCR/ESI-MS
in the identification of filamentous fungi.
Although the 16 primer pairs in the broad fungal assay kit were
designed to target different gene regions for the purpose of
discriminating different genus and/or species, PCR/ESI-MS is
still limited in its ability to distinguish among phylogenetically
closely related species. As revealed by our results, PCR/ESI-MS
could not distinguish species within the C. parapsilosis complex (C.
parapsilosis, C. metapsilosis, and C. orthopsilosis) and A. flavus complex
(A. flavus and A. oryzae). Moreover, P. guilliermondii, C. neoformans,
and A. versicolor are included in the coverage of the kit while their
closely related species such as P. caribbica, C. gattii, and A. sydowii are
not, which makes it difficult to distinguish these morphologically
similar species. A previous study showed that for ascomycetous
yeasts, D1/D2 LSU sequences were not specific enough to identify
closely related taxa, and the actin gene was a better marker in
these cases [39]. Another study recommended b-tubulin locus for
identification of individual species within various Aspergillus
complexes, while ITS regions for inter complex level identification
of Aspergillus spp. [40]. The intergenic spacer (IGS) sequence
analysis could differentiate between C. neoformans and C. gattii in
another study [41]. For distinction of P. guilliermondii and P.
caribbica, sequencing of either ITS or D1/D2 regions is a good tool,
as shown in results from our study and by others [42]. It seems that
introduction of additional target gene regions, such as ITS and
IGS, as well as different regions on LSU rRNA gene and b-tubulin
gene, may be helpful to improve the ability of PCR/ESI-MS to
differentiate among these closely related species, but may come
with an increase of the cost meanwhile.
