Human stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) offer an attractive platform to study
liver biology. Despite their numerous advantages, HLCs lack critical in vivo characteristics,
including cell polarity. Here, we report a stem cell differentiation protocol that uses trans￾well filters to generate columnar polarized HLCs with clearly defined basolateral and apical
membranes separated by tight junctions. We show that polarized HLCs secrete cargo
directionally: Albumin, urea, and lipoproteins are secreted basolaterally, whereas bile acids
are secreted apically. Further, we show that enterically transmitted hepatitis E virus (HEV)
progeny particles are secreted basolaterally as quasi-enveloped particles and apically as
naked virions, recapitulating essential steps of the natural infectious cycle in vivo. We also
provide proof-of-concept that polarized HLCs can be used for pharmacokinetic and drug-drug
interaction studies. This novel system provides a powerful tool to study hepatocyte biology,
disease mechanisms, genetic variation, and drug metabolism in a more physiologically
relevant setting.

A major function of the liver is to filter blood from the
digestive tract before it passes through the body. This task
is performed by hepatocytes, which filter and process
blood nutrients, metabolites, hormones, drugs, and other com￾pounds for storage and excretion. Hepatocytes thus form a crucial
cell layer engaged in two counter-current flow systems, which, on
the one hand, involve uptake, processing, and secretion of sinu￾soidal blood components, and on the other hand, synthesis and
secretion of bile1.
To mediate these functions, hepatocytes have a unique
polarization with multiple basolateral membranes facing the
sinusoids, and multiple apical membranes forming bile cana￾liculi (Fig. 1a, right panel). Within this peculiar structure, cell
signaling, membrane trafficking, protein secretion, and bile
transport are highly organized2. Although well described
morphologically, little is known about the molecules that
orchestrate polarization or their regulation, as a robust polar￾ized system to study authentic hepatocyte function is lacking.
Research tools are limited because few human hepatoma cell
lines can be polarized1; and those that can be polarized are
typically de-differentiated with altered proliferative, metabolic,
immune, and apoptotic responses.
Although primary human hepatocytes (PHH) offer a better
alternative, they are not extensively used due to their limited
availability, high donor-to-donor variability, and limited useful￾ness for genetic manipulation. In addition, PHH often de￾differentiate upon plating and lose their hepatic morphology and
functions1,3. To overcome these limitations, PPH can be expan￾ded in vivo in liver injury mouse models and subsequently plated
for in vitro studies4,5. Yet, potential co-purified mouse cells may,
depending of the assay applied, complicate the interpretation of
results. Sandwich or micropattern PHH cultures with supporting
stromal cells3 maintain hepatic polarization, but neither the
biliary membrane nor the cargo excreted into the closed bile
canaliculi are readily accessible (Fig. 1a, right panel). Further￾more, the extracellular matrix overlay hinders solute diffusion
and complicates live cell imaging studies. Hepatocyte-based
research would thus benefit from more reliable, physiologically
relevant, and more experimentally tractable hepatocellular
polarity systems.
For these reasons, human embryonic or induced pluripotent
stem cell (hESC/iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs6,7)
could offer an attractive option to fill this need for a polarized
hepatocyte culture model. Here we report a novel stem cell-based
differentiation protocol that generates columnar polarized HLCs.
These polarized HLCs secrete cargo directionally and allow non￾invasive sampling of both compartments. Albumin, urea, and
lipoproteins are secreted basolaterally, with bile acids secreted
apically. Enterically transmitted hepatitis E virus (HEV) progeny
particles are secreted basolaterally as quasi-enveloped particles
and apically as naked virions, recapitulating the natural history of
infection in vivo. We also provide proof-of-concept that polarized
HLCs offer an attractive platform to test and model drug–drug
interaction studies.
Results
Generation of HLCs exhibiting columnar polarization. As
described above, maintenance of cell polarity is essential for
retaining PHH functions, yet, HLCs are conventionally differ￾entiated in culture dishes under two-dimensional (2D) culture
conditions, a process that is inefficient, variable, and yields less￾polarized cells. The resulting HLCs are immature and resemble
fetal rather than adult hepatocytes6. When HLCs are differ￾entiated in spheroids8,9 or cultured in micropatterned co￾cultures10 they better recapitulate hepatocyte functions. This
suggests that three-dimensional (3D) architecture assists hepa￾tocyte maturation.
Most epithelial cells, such as lung or intestinal cells, are
columnar polarized (Fig. 1a). Some evidence exists that
hepatocyte differentiation passes through a columnar intermedi￾ate in vivo1. Therefore, we adapted an existing stem cell-based
HLC differentiation protocol11 to generate columnar polarized
HLCs on transwell filters (Fig. 1b). In the past, transwell filters
have been extensively used for columnar polarization (Fig. 1a) of
a range of cancer epithelial cells. As the transwell filter is
permeable, the configuration permits uptake and secretion of
molecules by both, the basolateral and apical sides of the cell,
allowing metabolic activities to occur in a more physiological
fashion.
We first differentiated hESCs to definitive endoderm (DE) in
culture dishes. By day 5, cells expressed lower levels of the
pluripotency marker Nanog compared with hESC cells (Fig. 1d)
and high levels of DE markers forkhead box protein A2 (FoxA2)
(Fig. 1c) and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4)
(Fig. 1d). To induce hepatic specification, we then seeded the DE
cells on matrigel-coated transwell filters in serum-free, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF)-containing medium. Expression of the
biliary markers keratin-19 (KRT19) and prominin-1 (PROM1)
increased by day 9 (Fig. 1e) and plateaued by day 13, at which
point the cells expressed nuclear hormone receptor HNF4α, an
accepted marker of human hepatic progenitor (HepProg) cells12
(Fig. 1c). We further matured the HepProg cells by exposing
them to basolateral medium without growth factors in the top
compartment, and to complete medium supplemented with HGF
and dexamethasone in the bottom compartment. This process
yielded immature hepatocytes (ImHep), which by day 16
expressed high levels of the fetal liver marker alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) (Fig. 1c and f). ImHeps were further matured by exposing
them to basic hepatocyte culture medium (HCM) in the top
compartment and complete HCM medium supplemented with
oncostatin-M in the bottom compartment. By day 21, this process
yielded HLCs that expressed high levels of the adult hepatocyte
marker albumin (ALB) (Fig. 1c and f). By counting ALB-positive
cells, we determined that ~80% of the final cell population
consisted of HLCs (Fig. 1c). Notably, HLCs underwent hepatic
multipolar polarization and formed apparent bile canaliculi when
grown on transwell filters with fully supplemented medium in
both compartments and overlaid with matrigel throughout
differentiation.
Having successfully generated HLCs on transwell filters, we
next examined several characteristic hepatic functions. The cells
stained positive with indocyanine green, a tricarbocyanine dye
that is taken up by hepatocytes (Fig. 1g). The HLCs also
demonstrated the ability to synthesize glycogen, as tested by
periodic acid-Schiff staining. We further demonstrated that HLCs
could metabolize non-fluorogenic carboxyfluorescein diacetate
into fluorogenic carboxyfluorescein (Fig. 1g). Next, we showed
that the cells formed a tight monolayer by measuring transe￾pithelial electrical resistance (~400 Ω/cm2) and assessing diffu￾sion of small fluorescent dextrans (4 kDa and 70 kDa), which
could not be detected in the opposite transwell compartment in
the presence of polarized HLCs (Fig. 1h). From day 16 of the
differentiation protocol, HLCs secreted characteristic hepatocyte
cargos such as ALB and urea (Fig. 1i). This coincided with
positive ALB staining (Fig. 1c).
This protocol was generalizable to multiple stem cell lines,
including hESC lines RUES213 and HUES8-iCas914 (Supple￾mentary Fig. 4) as well as the iPSC line iPS.C3A15. Importantly,
the majority of ALB and urea, normally secreted by native
hepatocytes from their basolateral membrane into the blood￾stream, was secreted into the bottom compartment (Fig. 1i).

These results indicate that the cells were differentiated into
metabolically functional polarized HLCs (pol-HLCs), with what
appeared to be simple, columnar epithelial polarization
(Fig. 1a). Of note, pol-HLCs continued to secrete ALB and
urea for another 22 days and 17 days, respectively (Supple￾mentary Fig. 1).
Properties of transwell-polarized HLCs. We then compared the
cellular structure of pol-HLCs with conventionally differentiated
HLCs on Matrigel-coated culture dishes. As shown in Fig. 2,
conventional HLCs exhibited some level of cellular polarity with
what appeared to be apical villi (Fig. 2a) and polarized distribu￾tion of some of the proteins analyzed (Fig. 2d). Yet, their degree

of polarization is markedly less compared with pol-HLCs differ￾entiated on transwells, as demonstrated in the following experi￾ments. For simplicity, we refer to conventionally plated HLCs
that have not been through our columnar polarization protocol as
“nonpol-HLCs”.
Transmission electron microscopy revealed, that pol-HLCs
were better organized, with a highly developed endoplasmic
reticulum, clearly defined nuclei and mitochondria, and intact
tight junctions (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the polarization on transwells
likely helps HLCs maintain a healthy cellular structure.
We then examined the structural polarization of pol-HLCs by
analyzing hepatic membrane proteins. We first confirmed their
expression in pol-HLCs (Fig. 2b) and then analyzed their 3D
distribution (Fig. 2d). According to their biological function,
these proteins are expressed either on the apical or basolateral
hepatocyte membrane. For example, the transferrin receptor is
almost exclusively localized on the basolateral compartment of
polarized epithelial cells16. Fluorescently conjugated human
transferrin was added in equal amounts to both top and bottom
transwell compartments to determine transferrin receptor
binding. As shown in Fig. 2c, the transferrin-conjugate bound
only to the membrane facing the bottom compartment,
consistent with localization of the transferrin receptor on or
near the basolateral membrane. We then compared immuno￾fluorescent staining of other hepatocyte polarity markers on pol￾and nonpol-HLCs (Fig. 2d). In pol-HLCs, the apical hepatic
markers, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multi-drug
resistance protein 2 (MRP2), were exclusively localized on the
upper (apical) membrane, whereas the lipoprotein receptor
scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-BI) was mainly localized on the
bottom (basolateral) membrane (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2d).
In contrast, nonpol-HLCs were flattened relative to pol-HLCs,
and the marker distribution was less defined. Both pol- and
nonpol- HLCs expressed the adherens junction protein E
cadherin together with the tight-junction protein ZO-1 at cellular
junctions (Fig. 2b–d), indicating that the cells developed proper
cell–cell junctions in both configurations. Together, these results
indicate that pol-HLCs acquire a simple, columnar polarization
with an apical membrane facing the top transwell compartment
and a basolateral membrane facing the bottom compartment.
Directional secretion of hepatic cargo. A major function of
hepatocytes is to regulate cholesterol levels in the body. Hepa￾tocytes achieve this by synthesizing and secreting lipoproteins
from their basolateral surface into the bloodstream for delivery to
the periphery. They further remove excess cholesterol from the
body by converting it into bile acids, which are then secreted from
the hepatocyte’s apical compartment and eliminated as waste. To
test if pol-HLCs could perform these activities, we performed
RNA-Seq analysis to assess whether the relevant enzymes are
expressed, then we measured the selectivity and directionality of
lipoprotein and bile acid release.
RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the lipoprotein biosynthetic
enzymes, apolipoproteins (Apo; key structural proteins of
lipoproteins), and lipoprotein receptors were generally upregu￾lated in pol-HLCs compared with nonpol-HLCs (Fig. 3a). We
confirmed this trend by quantifying key genes by qRT-PCR
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2). We and others have previously
shown that even nonpol-HLCs can synthesize and release ALB,
ApoB100 and ApoE17,18. Here, we found that pol-HLCs released
the majority of these cargos directionally from their basolateral
membrane (Supplementary Figs. 3).
Hepatocytes also synthesize fatty acids, de novo, that are
incorporated into triglycerides and exported as very-low-density
lipoproteins (VLDL). Hepatoma cells typically do not make high
levels of VLDL owing to a defect in their ability to fully lipidate
ApoB100, the main non-exchangeable cargo protein of VLDL. As
a result, hepatoma cells make low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
rather than VLDL19. We analyzed newly secreted lipoprotein
species from nonpol- and pol-HLCs by metabolically labeling the
lipoproteins followed by separation via density gradient centri￾fugation. Both pol- and nonpol-HLCs fully lipidated ApoB
(Fig. 3b). In agreement with a recent study18, this suggests that
HLCs in general, unlike hepatoma cells, have a functional VLDL
biosynthesis pathway. Importantly, pol-HLCs secreted higher
levels of lipoproteins than nonpol-HLCs, and these lipoproteins
were selectively secreted into the basolateral compartment
(Fig. 3b). ApoB100 secretion decreased when the cells were
treated, in the basolateral compartment, with the microsomal
triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) inhibitor Lomitapide
(Fig. 3c). Higher concentrations of the MTTP-inhibitor were
needed to block ApoB100 secretion by pol-HLCs compared with
nonpol-HLCs, possibly due to their ability to eliminate drugs by
secretion into the apical compartment.
Overexpression of human Apo-CIII in rat hepatocytes
enhances VLDL production20. In the absence of a suitable
culture system, it has not been possible to test the role of Apo￾CIII in lipoprotein secretion from human hepatocytes. Given that
HLCs can efficiently synthesize lapidated VLDL, we used the
parental stem cell line HUES8-iCas914 with inducible CRISPR￾Cas9 to create Apo-CIII knockout cell clones (Supplementary
Fig. 4a, b)21. Surprisingly, under lipid rich conditions, the absence
of Apo-CIII in pol-HLCs had no observable effect on lipoprotein
assembly or secretion (Supplementary Figs. 4c and d).
Next, we examined bile acid synthesis and release. RNA-Seq
and Ingenuity pathway analysis showed an upregulation of genes
involved in the farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor and liver
X receptor/-retinoid X receptor pathways in pol-HLCs compared
with nonpol-HLCs (Fig. 3d). These pathways regulate lipid
metabolism and catalyze cholesterol to bile acid metabolism22.
Pol-HLCs expressed higher levels of major enzymes responsible
for converting cholesterol to bile acid. Apical bile acid
transporters, in contrast to basolateral transporters, were
upregulated in pol-HLCs (Fig. 3d).
We then measured bile acid secretion from nonpol-HLCs as
well as from the apical and basolateral sides of pol-HLCs (Fig. 3e).
Nonpol-HLCs secreted bile acids at low levels. In contrast, pol￾HLCs secreted high levels of bile acids into the apical
compartment and only trace amounts into the basolateral
compartment. Apical bile acid release could be stimulated by
incubating cells with cholesterol in the form of high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), and inhibited by treating cells with the
cholestasis-causing drug cyclosporine A (Fig. 3e).
PHHs mainly secrete glycine or taurin conjugates of cholic acid
(CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), whereas HepG2
hepatoma cells secrete mainly precursors and unconjugated bile
acids23. HLCs, probably owing to their immature nature, were
reported to secrete unconjugated CA and CDCA24. We therefore
used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to
profile released bile acid species. Pol-HLCs synthesized and
released the two primary bile acids, CA and CDCA, mainly from
the apical side into the top compartment. Of note, unlike nonpol￾HLCs24, pol-HLCs secreted both bile acid species and their
conjugates at a similar ratio (Fig. 3f and g). Incubation with the
cholesterol-derived bile acid precursor 7α-hydroxylcholesterol25
(7α-CHO) increased CA and CDCA synthesis and release from
pol-HLCs (Fig. 3f and g). Although the majority of CA and
CDCA was still released from the apical side, we also observed
some level of basal secretion, suggesting that treatment of pol￾HLCs with high doses of 7α-CHO induced excessive bile acid
synthesis.

These results indicate that pol-HLCs exhibit improved
lipoprotein synthesis, cholesterol to bile acid conversion, and
bile acid release compared with nonpol-HLCs. In addition, the
observed directional cargo release further confirmed the func￾tional polarity of pol-HLCs.
Polarized enteric virus release. Hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV,
HEV) exploit unique properties of hepatocyte polarization that
standard tissue culture systems fail to support. In a natural
infection, these viruses enter polarized hepatocytes through
the basolateral membrane, replicate, and produce progeny viru￾ses. It is thought that progeny viruses then egress from the hepatic
basolateral membrane into the bloodstream to spread within
the host, and from the apical membrane into the bile and
feces to infect new hosts (reviewed in refs. 26,27). Owing to the
absence of viral glycoproteins, HAV and HEV are classified as

non-enveloped viruses. Recently, it has been found that both
viruses acquire a host cell-derived exosomal membrane-like “quasi￾envelope” by budding into multivesicular bodies28,29. HAV and
HEV particles circulating in the patient blood are quasi-enveloped,
whereas those found in the feces are non-enveloped and highly
infectious28,29. To date, experimental evidence that progeny HAV
and HEV particles differentially bud from the hepatocytes’ apical
and basolateral membranes is lacking.
We previously showed that nonpol-HLCs are permissive for
HEV infection and replication, but few infectious progeny
particles were released21. To test if pol-HLCs support HEV
infection, we infected the cells from their basolateral side,
harvested newly secreted virus from either the apical or
basolateral compartment at 7 days post infection, and measured
infectivity on human hepatoma S10-3 cells (Fig. 4a). To confirm
replication-dependent secretion of new particles, we treated pol￾HLCs with either sofosbuvir (SOF), an HEV RNA replication
inhibitor30, or a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control.
Newly produced infectious particles were released into both
compartments, but the majority (fivefold more) was released on
the apical side (Fig. 4a). To assess whether this was also the case
for physical virus particles, we quantified HEV RNA copies. As
shown in Fig. 4b, pol-HLCs released threefold more physical
particles from the apical membrane, which did not fully account
for the fivefold increased infectivity. This suggested that apically
released particles were more infectious than the basolaterally
released particles. We also observed a higher amount of capsid
protein ORF2 released from the apical membrane. The ELISA
used in this study does not distinguish between the glycosylated
and non-glycosylated ORF2 forms that have been recently found
to be associated with infectious particles31,32. The possible
directional release of these two distinct ORF2 forms can be
now analyzed with the pol-HLC system.
The quasi-envelope on HEV particles has been previously
shown to reduce their infectivity33. In cell culture, non-polarized
hepatoma cells release only quasi-enveloped particles (extracel￾lular HEV, Fig. 4i). As they are not polarized, these cells must be
lysed to recover non-enveloped particles (intracellular HEV).
In agreement with previous studies28,33–36 we found that the
quasi-envelope rendered extracellular HEV less infectious (Sup￾plementary Fig. 5), but protected the virus from neutralization by
anti-HEV capsid ORF2 protein antibodies (Fig. 4d). Unlike
apically released particles, basolaterally released particles were
fully protected from neutralization with anti-ORF2 (Fig. 4c) and
could not be immunoprecipitated with an anti-ORF2 antibody
(Supplementary Fig. 6). This confirmed the presence of the quasi￾envelope, which rendered basolateral HEV particles less infec￾tious. Our data are therefore in agreement with observations
made in vivo and the current model for polarized HEV particle
production of naked (apical) highly infectious virions and quasi￾enveloped (basolateral) less infectious, neutralization-resistant
particles (reviewed in refs. 37,38).
As treating extracellular HEV with detergent or bile salts
removes the quasi-envelope28,34 (Fig. 4d), we tested whether
apically secreted bile salts from pol-HLCs (Fig. 3e) could
transform basolaterally released HEV into non-enveloped and
highly infectious particles. Extra- and intracellular HEV particles
harvested from HEV replicating S10-3 cells were treated with
either apical or basolateral supernatant from pol-HLCs (Fig. 4e).
Apical but not basolateral supernatant enhanced the infectivity of
extracellular but not intracellular HEV particles. Once treated
with apical supernatant, extracellular particles could be readily
neutralized with anti-ORF2 (Fig. 4e); albeit with a lower
efficiency, possibly owing to insufficient bile acid concentration.
To further examine the role of bile acids, we transduced
H9 cells with a lentivirus delivering a doxycycline (DOX)
inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting CYP8B1, a key
enzyme responsible for converting cholesterol to bile acid (H9/
shCYP8B1). After selecting transfected cells, we differentiated
H9/shCYP8B1 cells to pol-HLCs. Forty-eight hours before
terminal HLC differentiation, we treated H9/shCYP8B1 cells
with 3 μg/ml DOX to induce shRNA expression and knockdown
of CYP8B1. As a result, CYP8B1 expression (Fig. 4f) and apical
bile acid release (Fig. 4g) were reduced by ~30%. We then mixed
apical supernatant from these cells with extracellular HEV
particles (Fig. 4h & Supplementary Fig. 7). Unlike supernatant
from wild-type cells, this apical supernatant failed to enhance
infectivity of extracellular HEV particles, suggesting that the co￾secreted bile acids from pol-HLCs were responsible for removing
the envelope (Fig. 4i).
We also used pol-HLCs to study the directional secretion of
HAV, which similar to HEV, is enterically transmitted and
acquires a quasi-envelope during budding39. HAV efficiently
infected pol-HLCs (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the HAV
strain used in our study was cytolytic for pol-HLCs disrupting the
cellular monolayer by 48 h post infection. This is likely the reason
why similar levels of HAV were found in both transwell
compartments after 48 h of infection (Fig. 4j). In order to study
directional HAV release, it will be interesting to examine natural
HAV isolates, which do not appear to lyse infected cells40.
The pol-HLC system can thus be infected with two enterically
transmitted hepatitis viruses, HAV and HEV, providing a
platform to analyze and compare their mechanisms of assembly
and secretion from polarized hepatocytes.
Drug uptake, metabolism, and secretion. Many drugs are
metabolized and eliminated by hepatocytes. Hepatocytes have
phase I and III enzymes that metabolize compounds, which are
then secreted by phase III drug transporters into either the blood
(from the basolateral membrane) or into bile (from the apical
membrane). Hepatobiliary elimination can be a major clearance
pathway that dictates drug pharmacokinetics. In vitro, current
available cellular models to study drug disposition are limited.
PHH in sandwich cultures are the gold standard for these studies,
but they secrete apical cargo into bile pockets, which must be
accessed to measure biliary efflux and evaluate biliary transporter
interactions. This is technically challenging and moreover,
opening the bile canaliculi destroys the cells, which precludes
simple non-disruptive measurements of apical drug release
over time.
As the pol-HLC system has constrained apical and basolateral
compartments and secretes accessible cargo directionally, we
tested the system for studying antiviral drug absorption, vectorial
efflux, and drug–drug interactions. Numerous studies proposed
the use of non-polarized HLCs to screen drugs and study drug￾induced toxicity6,10,41–43. We first compared pol-HLCs with
nonpol-HLCs for their ability to express enzymes and transpor￾ters that mediate drug disposition. RNA-Seq analysis revealed
that phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes were differentially
expressed by pol- and nonpol-HLCs (Supplementary Fig. 9). As
shown in Fig. 5a and b and in agreement with the RNA-Seq data
(Fig. 3), pol-HLCs expressed higher levels of apical, but not
basolateral phase III drug transporters. This suggested that pol￾HLCs were enhanced in their ability to mediate hepatobiliary
drug secretion.
We then tested pol-HLC for modeling an antiviral combination
drug regimen that has well characterized pharmacokinetics
(Fig. 5c). For this we chose STRIBILD, a fixed dose anti-HIV
combination therapy. This regimen includes emtricitabine (FTC),
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), elvitegravir (EVT), and
cobicistat (COBI). To model STRIBILD disposition, we incubated

pol-HLCs from their basolateral membrane with FTC, TDF, and
EVT combined at a ratio mimicking the approved antiviral
regimen with or without COBI. Unlike the other three
compounds, which are direct virus replication inhibitors, COBI
blocks the drug-metabolizing CYP3A4 enzymes, as well as drug
transporters. We then measured the absorption and secretion
from either basolateral or apical membrane over a 2 h period
using LC-MS. As shown in Fig. 5c, the cells absorbed each drug at
a different rate, as evidenced by the steady decrease of free
compound in the bottom transwell compartment. EVT and TDF
were rapidly absorbed, whereas FTC, which is known to have a
long plasma half-life44, was slowly absorbed. Concomitant with
the decrease in the bottom transwell compartment, the amount
increased in the top compartment, suggestive of partial biliary
release from the apical membrane. We also detected a slow release
of tenofovir (TF) in both compartments, demonstrating that pol￾HLCs metabolized TDF converting it to TF. Co-administering
COBI only affected EVT absorption, which unlike FTC and TDF,
is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme family. COBI decreased
the rate of EVT absorption by approximately threefold and
reduced apical EVT release by ~50%. This is in agreement with
EVT’s increased plasma half-life (from 3–9 h) when boosted by
COBI, allowing it to be dosed once daily45,46. These observations
show that COBI helps sustain basolateral levels of EVT in blood
by reducing its uptake and metabolism in hepatocytes. In
contrast, COBI did not affect FTC or TDF levels, which suggested

that the observed decrease of EVT is not owing to diffusion
between the two transwell compartments but rather is limited
by the action of enzymes and transporters. Therefore, the pol￾HLC system recapitulates observations made in humans and
demonstrates the potential application to pre-clinical drug
development46.
Discussion
Cell polarity is based on the asymmetric organization of cellular
components, and is a pre-requisite for fundamental biological
processes. It enables a polarized cell to ensure directional cargo
transport and release while maintaining a barrier within the
epithelium. Although most epithelial cells typically establish a
columnar apical-basal polarity, hepatocytes distinguish them￾selves by their multipolar organization, which allows them to
exert their particular activities in the 3D environment of the liver.
Current in vitro models for hepatocyte polarity studies are sub￾optimal. Only few hepatoma cell clones can be columnar polar￾ized, but their transformed nature makes them undesirable for
many applications. Transferring already differentiated, non￾proliferative PHHs onto the transwell membrane does not give
rise to PHH with columnar polarization but rather induces
restoration of their previously formed multipolar structure, which
restricts apical and basal cargo sampling (data not shown).
Similarly, plating human fetal hepatoblasts (usually from week 15
to 21 of gestation) from different donors onto the transwell
membrane also fails to form a tight monolayer and columnar
polarized hepatocytes (data not shown). Here, we report a stem
cell-based differentiation protocol to generate polarized HLCs on
transwell filters. The use of transwell filters yielded a columnar
polarization that was likely achieved and supported by the one￾sided exposure to ECM and appropriate nutrient gradients.
We first examined the structural polarization of pol-HLCs by
analyzing the localization of hepatocyte membrane proteins.
Immunofluorescence staining showed that pol-HLCs have clearly
defined basolateral and apical membranes separated by tight
junctions. We also showed that pol-HLCs possess functional
polarity. Hepatic cargo destined to reach the bloodstream such as
albumin, urea, and lipoproteins were secreted basolaterally. In
contrast, bile acids, destined for secretion into the biliary system,
were secreted apically from pol-HLCs. We further found that pol￾HLCs can recapitulate the directionality of HEV infection in vivo:
HEV progeny particles are secreted basolaterally as quasi￾enveloped particles and apically as naked virions. Knocking
down CYP8B1, a key enzyme in bile acid metabolism, revealed
that co-secreted bile acids strip the envelope from apically
released virions rendering them highly infectious. Finally, by
showing that pol-HLCs faithfully replicated hepatocyte uptake
and biliary/blood excretion of the once-daily anti-HIV regimen
STRIBILD, we provided proof-of-concept that polarized HLCs
can be used for pharmacokinetic and drug–drug interaction
studies.
We are aware that despite recapitulating some hepatocyte
functions better than nonpol-HLCs, pol-HLCs still retain an
immature phenotype as evidenced by the transcriptome com￾parison with PHHs (Supplementary Fig. 2). Efforts are ongoing
by multiple labs to optimize protocols and identify compounds
and conditions that can enhance maturation of HLCs. Success
and combination with the protocol described here may even￾tually yield highly functional polarized HLCs that better reca￾pitulate fully mature hepatocyte functions. However, the system
described here has several immediate advantages. Unlike PHHs,
pol-HLCs are derived from a renewable, reproducible, and cost￾effective source. Furthermore, the resulting apical-basal polarity
and release of cargo in separate compartments allows easy
sampling and analysis over time. This, together with the ability to
genetically manipulate cellular proteins of interest such as
membrane transporters, will help advance our general under￾standing of the polarized hepatic trafficking machinery and
how components are selectively targeted to the apical versus the
basolateral compartment.
Members of the CYP450 family and other phase I, II, and III
drug-metabolizing enzymes have poor expression and induction
levels in hepatoma cells, which is why they are unsuitable for drug
metabolism and disposition studies. As mentioned before, HLCs
have been proposed as an attractive alternative to overcome these
limitations. In addition, as HLCs can be generated from patient￾specific iPSCs47, studying the impact of genetic polymorphism
and inter-individual variations on drug exposure and toxicity can
facilitate the development of personalized therapies. The ability of
pol-HLCs to excrete drugs from either the basolateral or apical
membrane will improve these types of studies.
In conclusion, this novel stem cell differentiation protocol
provides a powerful cell culture system to study proper hepato￾cyte function, which will lead not only to a better understanding
of normal liver physiology, but also holds promise for informing
therapeutic options and drug development.

Isolation and culture of PHHs. PHHs were isolated from patient liver tissue after
partial hepatectomy. The protocol was authorized following written informed
consent of the patients and approved by the ethics commission of Hannover
Medical School (EthikKommission der MHH, Nr. 252-2008). Isolated PHHs were
seeded on collagen-plated plates and used for studies 48 h post plating.
RT-PCR and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cell
lysates using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by reverse transcription using
Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene expression
was quantified using the LightCycler SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche Life Sci￾ence, Indianapolis, IN) on a LightCycler 480 Instrument I (Roche Life Science)
with primers as listed in Supplemental Table 1. Relative expression data were
calculated into fold changes based on cycle thresholds.
Fluorescent dextran assay. Polarized HLCs were incubated with 4 kDa fluor￾escein isothiocyanate–dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) or 70 kDa rhodamine B
isothiocyanate–dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in either apical or basolateral
HCM medium to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml overnight (O/N) at 37 °C. To
dissociate cell–cell junctions, 2.5 mM EDTA (Gibco) was added. Fluorescence was
measured using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech) (FITC-dextran:
Exc: 485 nm and Em: 544 nm and rhodamine B-dextran: Exc: 520 nm and Em:
590 nM).
Transmission electron microscopy. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.075 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4.
Subsequently, cells were washed in the buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetra￾oxide for 1 hr, underwent en bloc staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 min,
dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol, infiltrated with a resin (Eponate12,
Electron Microscope Sciences) and embedded with the resin. After polymerization
at 60 °C for 48 h, ultra-thin sections were cut, underwent post-staining with 2%
uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate and were examined under a JEOL JEM 1400Plus
transmission electron microscope equipped with SerialEM49 in montage mode and
the digital imaging system (Gatan Digital Micrograph 1000) (a gift from the
Helmsley Charitable Trust). EM data were processed by IMOD42.
Immunofluorescence staining and analysis. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (RT) for 30 min and blocked
with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (3% B-PBS). Cells were incubated with
primary antibodies in 3% B-PBS at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibodies con￾jugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermofisher) or Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermofisher) in
3% B-PBS were added and incubated at RT for 1 hr, followed by several washes
with PBS. The staining with transferrin-594 conjugate (Thermofisher) was per￾formed following the manufacturer’s protocol. For HLC cultures grown on
transwell filters, the filter was removed from the hanging insert and submerged, cell
side up, in PBS using a slice anchor (Warner Instruments). Cultures were imaged
on an Upright BX61WI microscope (Olympus) with a UMPlan FL 60 × 1.0 NA
water dipping objective (Olympus) or UMPlan FL ×10, 0.3 NA water dipping
objective and an Orca Flash 4.0 digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu) using Meta￾Morph image acquisition software (Molecular Devices). Deconvolution was per￾formed using the standard adaptive point spread settings in Autoquant (Media
Cybernetics). Image analysis was conducted using Fiji.
RNA-seq analysis. Approximately 100 ng of total RNA isolated from biological
duplicate samples using the RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen) was used as input.
Sequencing libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT
Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq with a read length
of 51 nt (single end, reverse stranded). Output sequencing read quality was ana￾lyzed using the Seqtk (version 1.2) and fastx_toolkit (version 0.0.14) software tools
and used without further processing. The reads were mapped to the Ensembl
human genome assembly GRCh37 (also known as hg19) using Tophat2 (version
2.0.12; Bowtie version 2.2.7) with first-strand library type, no novel junctions, and
otherwise default options. Mapped reads were counted using featureCounts (from
subread version 1.4.6) with default options. Statistical analysis was performed using
a count-based workflow50 with the edgeR Bioconductor package (version 3.12.1).
In brief, gene counts were normalized to counts per million reads and genes with
<10–15 mapped reads were filtered out. Transcriptome composition bias between
samples was eliminated using edgeR’s default trimmed mean of M-values nor￾malization. Differential expression analyses were performed using edgeR’s
quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood method.
Western blotting. Cell lysates were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate￾polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), as previously described30.
Western blotting analysis was performed using specific antibodies as
described above.
Total bile acids assay. Bile acids were measured using the total bile acid assay kit
from Cell Biolabs, Inc. following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Bile acid quantitation by LC-MS. An Agilent 1290 UHPLC coupled to a Sciex
4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer was used. The MS instrument was operated in the
multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with negative-ion (−) detection. A
Waters BEH C18 column (2.1 mm I.D. × 15 cm, 1.7 μm) was used for LC separation
with a mobile phase composed of (A) 0.01% formic acid in water and (B) 0.01%
formic acid in acetonitrile for binary-solvent gradient elution. For the reference
substances, a standard mix containing all targeted bile acids was dissolved in 50%
methanol at 10 nmol/ml. This solution (S1) was further diluted step by step at a
same dilution ratio of 1–4 (v/v) with the same solvent to have standard solutions of
S2 to S10. 50 μl of S1 to S10 each was mixed with 50 μl of an internal standard (IS)
solution containing 14D-labeled bile acid analogs. In all, 20 μl of each solution was
injected to run UPLC-(−)ESI-MRM/MS. Linear calibration curves were constructed
using analyte-to-internal standard peak area ratios (As/Ai) versus molar con￾centrations (nmol/mL) of each bile acid. For the samples, 50 μl of each vortex-mixed
cell medium was mixed with 25 μl of the IS solution and 250 μl of acetonitrile in an
Eppendorf tube. After sonication in an ice-water bath for 2 min, the mixture was
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 10 °C for 15 min. The clear supernatant was transferred
into a “V”-shape LC injection microvial and dried in a speed-vacuum concentrator.
The residue was reconstituted in 100 μl of 50% methanol. 20 μl was injected for
quantitation of bile acids by UPLC-(−)ESI-MRM/MS.
Lipoprotein secretion assay. Pulse-chase labeled lipoprotein secretion assays and
density gradient separation were performed as previously described19. In brief, cells
were metabolically labeled for 4 h with [35S] methionine/cysteine. Supernatants
from labeled cells were subjected to density gradient centrifugation followed by
ApoB100 or ApoE immunoprecipitation of each fraction, separation by SDS￾PAGE, and detection by [35S] fluorography.
ELISAs. HEV ORF2 (Wantai), ALB, ApoB and ApoB ELISAs (Abcam) were
performed according to manufacturer’s protocols.
Generation of Apo-CIII-KO cells. Guide RNA sequence (5′-GCACGCCAC
CAAGACCGCCA-3′) targeting exon 2 of ApoC-III locus was cloned into the
pX458 vector, a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #48138), in vitro tran￾scribed using the MEGAshortscript Kit, and purified using the MEGAclear Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The guide RNA was transfected into HUES8-iCas9wt
cells, which upon treatment with 3 μg/ml Dox inducibly express CRISPR-Cas914.
Dox was added to transfected cultures for 48 h and cells were seeded in clonal
limiting dilution and grown on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. ApoC-III￾KO cells were screened by and validated by genome sequencing and Western Blot
analysis for absence of ApoC-III expression.
HEV and HAV infections. Cell culture grown HEV strain Kernow-C1 P6 (Gen￾Bank accession number JQ67901) and HAV strain HM175/18 f (GenBank acces￾sion number M59808) were generated as previously described30,51. Polarized HLCs
were infected with cell culture grown HEV or HAV at day 21 of the differentiation
protocol by inoculation from the basolateral membrane. Virus inoculum was
removed the next day, followed by washes with HCM medium. Cells were then
maintained in HCM medium, with medium renewals every second day. Newly
secreted virus was harvested from either the apical or basolateral compartment
(7 days post infection for HEV and 2 days post infection for HAV for titration) on
S10-3 hepatoma cells (a generous gift from Suzanne U. Emerson, NIH).

Drug disposition analysis by LC-MS/MS. Samples were submitted in a 10 μl
volume of which 3 μl (30% of total) was analyzed by liquid chromatography tan￾dem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, SRM). Compounds were separated by
reversed phase chromatography (C8, 150 mm length × 2.1 mm ID, Acclaim
Thermo) using a gradient delivered at 200 μL/min, increasing from 5% B/95% to
50% B/50% A in 5.5 min. (Solvent A: 0.1% Formic Acid, Solvent B: Acetonitrile/
0.1% formic acid). The most intense fragment ion was used as transition for
each compound when quantitated: Cobicistat: 776.4+→606.2+, Elvitegravir:
448.0+→344.0+, Emtricitabine: 248.0+→130.1+, and 270.0+ (sodium ion adduct)
→152.0+, Tenofovir: 520.1+→270.0+, and Fluoxetine as internal standard:
310.0+→148.0+. Each molecule was quantitated using an external calibration
(12 fm, 24 fm, 48 fm, 98 fm, 195 fm, 0.78 pm, 1.56 pm, 3.13 pm, 6.25 pm, 12.5 pm,
25.0 pm, 50.0 pm, and 100 pm). Dwell time of 50 msec together with an isolation of
0.7 Th was used for all compounds.
Statistics. Graphs and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad PRISM
5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). In all figures where p-values were calculated, the
corresponding statistical test is listed in the figure legend.
