Abstract
Introduction: A potential independent association was recently demonstrated between high red blood cell
distribution width (RDW) and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients, although the mechanism underlying
this relationship remains unclear. Little is known about the impact changes in RDW may have on survival in critically ill
patients. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic significance of changes in RDW during hospital stay in patients with
severe sepsis or septic shock.
Methods: We prospectively enrolled 329 patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) and received
a standardized resuscitation algorithm (early-goal directed therapy) for severe sepsis or septic shock. The relationship
between the changes in RDW during the first 72 hours after ED admission and all-cause mortality (28-day and 90-day)
were analyzed by categorizing the patients into four groups according to baseline RDW value and ΔRDW72hr-adm (RDW
at 72 hours – RDW at baseline).
Results: The 28-day and 90-day mortality rates were 10% and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with increased RDW at
baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2% exhibited the highest risks of 28-day and 90-day mortality, whereas the patients
with normal RDW level at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm ≤0.2% (the reference group) had the lowest mortality risks.
For 90-day mortality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed in the patients whose RDW increased within
72 hours of ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2%), compared to the reference group.
These associations remained unaltered even after adjusting for age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, renal replacement therapy, albumin, hemoglobin, lactate, C-reactive protein and
infection sites in multivariable models.
Conclusions: We found that an increase in RDW from baseline during the first 72 hours after hospitalization is
significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, a combination of baseline RDW value and an
increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
Introduction
The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) repre￾sents an index of the heterogeneity of the erythrocytes
(anisocytosis), which is calculated by dividing the stand￾ard deviation of erythrocyte volume by the mean corpus￾cular volume (MCV) and multiplying by 100 to express
the result as a percentage [1]. RDW is widely available to
clinicians because it is routinely reported as part of the
complete blood count.
For several decades, RDW has been typically used in
combination with the MCV to differentiate the cause of
underlying anemia in clinical practice [2]. Recently,
highly significant associations have been described be￾tween RDW value and all-cause, noncardiac, and cardiac
mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, acute
and chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke,
pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary artery hyperten￾sion [3-8]. Moreover, several studies have reported that
RDW shows the predictive value of all-cause mortality

in critically ill or intensive care unit (ICU) patients [9-12].
Although it has been postulated that systemic inflamma￾tion, malnutrition, and impaired renal function play a
significant role in the underlying pathological processes
[13], the mechanism of the association between increased
RDW and mortality remains unclear.
Until now, most previous studies that have investi￾gated the relationship between RDW and clinical out￾comes of various cohorts have used a single RDW
measurement at initial presentation, and little is known
about the potential impact of changes in RDW from
baseline on survival in critically ill patients. However,
RDW can be considered as a dynamic variable with
rapid changes associated with acute disease states such
as acute myocardial infarction and acute decompensated
heart failure [14,15]. Thus, we hypothesized that the
changes in RDW from baseline can reflect acute disease
states and provide more prognostic information than the
baseline RDW value alone. Therefore, we investigated
whether the change in RDW value between baseline and
72 hours after hospital admission had prognostic value
for clinical outcomes in patients with severe sepsis or
septic shock.
Materials and methods
Patients
Eligible adult patients who were admitted to the emer￾gency department (ED) with severe sepsis and/or septic
shock between November 2007 and November 2011 were
assessed for possible enrollment according to inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Since November 2007, early goal￾directed therapy (EGDT) has been implemented in the
ICU and in the ED at our institute as part of a quality im￾provement initiative. If a patient presented with two or
more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria
and a suspicious sign of infection, the patient’s eligibility
for EGDT was assessed. One or both of the following trig￾gered initiation of our EGDT protocol: (a) initial systolic
blood pressure <90 mmHg, despite a 20 mL/kg intra￾venous crystalloid fluid challenge; or (b) initial serum
lactate level ≥4 mmol/L. The criteria for exclusion
included: (a) age <18 years; (b) any contraindication to
central venous catheterization; and/or (c) presence of a
do-not-resuscitate order.
The study was carried out in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Yonsei University Health System Clinical
Trial Center. We obtained informed written consent from
all participants involved in our study.
Data collection
Baseline characteristics including demographic information
and preexisting chronic comorbidities were collected. The
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to assess the
burden of chronic disease [16,17]. Moreover, both Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
score were determined using the worst values within the
initial 24 hours of ED admission for disease severity assess￾ment. SOFA score was calculated by the parameters as
follows: PaO2/FiO2, platelet count, bilirubin, blood pres￾sure and the use of inotropic agent, Glasgow coma score
scale, and creatinine or urine output. In addition, RDW,
white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb) level,
hematocrit, and MCV were measured at initial presenta￾tion and at 72 hours after ED admission, using the Advia
2120 Hematology Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnos￾tics, Deerfield, IL, USA). RDW is reported as a coefficient
of variation (percentage) of red blood cell volume. The
normal reference range for RDW in this hospital laboratory
is 11.5 to 14.5%.
Definitions
Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were defined
using the American College of Chest Physicians/Society
of Critical Care Medicine consensus conference defini￾tions [18]. Sepsis was defined by two or more of the fol￾lowing conditions as a result of infection: (i) temperature
greater than 38°C, (ii) heart rate greater than 90 beats/
min, (iii) respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths/min or
PaCO2 less than 32 mmHg, and (iv) WBC count greater
than 12,000 cells/μL or less than 4,000 cells/μL. Severe
sepsis was defined as sepsis associated with organ dys￾function, hypoperfusion abnormality, or sepsis-induced
hypotension. Hypoperfusion abnormalities included lactic
acidosis, oliguria, and acute alteration of mental status. In
addition, septic shock was defined as sepsis with hypo￾tension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Hypotension
was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or
less, or a reduction of greater than 40 mmHg from baseline
in the absence of other causes of low blood pressure.
Infection sites were categorized as pneumonia, periton￾itis, urinary tract infection, exacerbation of chronic ob￾structive pulmonary disease, catheter-related infection,
primary bacteremia (excluding untreated Staphylococcus
epidermidis bacteremia), miscellaneous sites (mediastinitis,
prostatitis, osteomyelitis, and others), or multiple sites [19].
Effectiveness of antibiotics was assessed based on the
microbial culture results, the known susceptibility of the
organism to the antimicrobials used, and antimicrobial sus￾ceptibility testing [19].
Statistical analyses
Continuous variables are expressed as means ± standard
deviation or median (interquartile ranges), and categorical
variables as numbers with percentages. Baseline character￾istics of the groups were compared using one-way analysis
of variance for continuous variables and the χ2 test for

categorical variables. In the present study, all patients
were followed for 12 months after admission to the
ED. We evaluated 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality
as primary endpoints. We also investigated the total length
of hospital stay (TLHS) as a secondary endpoint for ana￾lysis. The change in RDW between baseline and 72 hours
after ED admission (ΔRDW72hr-adm) was calculated as
RDW at 72 hours – RDW at baseline, and the median
value of ΔRDW72hr-adm was 0.2%. Moreover, we catego￾rized patients into four groups according to baseline RDW
value and ΔRDW72hr-adm as follows: group 1, patients with
RDW levels in the reference range (normal RDW level) at
baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm ≤0.2%; group 2, patients with
increased RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm ≤0.2%;
group 3, patients with normal RDW at baseline and
ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2%; and group 4, patients with increased
RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2%. Based on the
four groups stratified by baseline RDW value and
ΔRDW72hr-adm, survival curves were designed using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were made using
the log-rank test. The prognostic value of the changes in
RDW on 28-day and 90-day mortality was determined
using Cox proportional hazards model, and the results
were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confi￾dence intervals (CIs). In multivariate analysis, the Cox
models were adjusted for age, sex, SOFA score, CCI, renal
replacement therapy (RRT), serum albumin level, Hb, lac￾tate, C-reactive protein (CRP), and infection sites, which
were thought to plausibly interact with both RDW and
mortality. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression ana￾lysis was also performed to determine the factors inde￾pendently associated with TLSH. All tests were two-sided,
and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically signifi￾cant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for
Windows version 19.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 436 patients who received EGDT in the ED
were initially enrolled in the present study. We excluded
65 patients who were diagnosed with uncured malig￾nancy, active gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute coronary
syndrome. Twenty-five patients who received red blood
cell (RBC) transfusion within 72 hours after ED admission
were also excluded. In the final analysis, we included 329
patients, excepting 17 patients who died within 72 hours
after ED admission (Figure 1).
The mean age of the patients was 64.4 ± 15.6 years and
48.9% of patients were male. The mean APACHE II
score was 17.5 ± 7.3 and the mean SOFA score was 8.1 ±
2.8. Moreover, RDW levels were from 11.4% to 20.3%
(median, 13.5%; mean, 14.0 ± 1.6%) at baseline and from
11.5% to 20.8% (median, 13.8%; mean, 14.1 ± 1.6%) at 72
hours after ED admission, and the main infection sites
were urinary tract (24.6%) and lung (24.3%), followed by
intra-abdominal cavity (21.9%) (Table 1). The baseline clin￾ical characteristics of each group stratified by baseline
RDW value and ΔRDW72hr-adm are presented in Table 1.
Compared with the other groups, group 1 exhibited signifi￾cantly lower age, APACHE II score, SOFA score, and CCI,
while baseline Hb, serum albumin, and total cholesterol in
group 1 were significantly higher than those in the other
groups. Group 4 had the highest lactate level, but the dif￾ference did not reach the statistical significance (P = 0.065).
The proportion of patients who received RRT due to renal
failure was highest in group 4.
An increase in RDW from baseline was significantly
associated with mortality
Thirty-three patients (10%) died within 28 days after ED
admission, and 48 patients (14.6%) died during the 90-
day follow-up. The impacts of the changes in RDW be￾tween baseline and 72 hours after ED admission on 28-day
and 90-day mortality are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Group 1 had the lowest mortality rate during the 28-day
and 90-day follow-up compared with the other groups
(P <0.001, Figure 2).
In Cox regression analysis of 28-day mortality (Table 2),
crude HRs were 10.09 (95% CI, 2.24 to 45.52; P = 0.003)
in group 2, 3.64 (95% CI, 0.77 to 17.14; P = 0.102) in
group 3, and 21.78 (95% CI, 4.85 to 96.95; P <0.001)
in group 4 when group 1 was considered as a reference
group (Unadjusted Model). However, after adjusting for
age, sex, SOFA score, CCI, RRT, serum albumin, Hb, lac￾tate, and CRP (Model 1), only group 4 showed a signifi￾cantly higher 28-day mortality risk (HR, 7.85; 95% CI,
1.63 to 37.76; P = 0.010). Further adjustment of Model 1
for infection site (Model 2) did not attenuate the signifi￾cantly higher 28-day mortality risk of group 4 (HR, 9.97;
95% CI, 1.99 to 49.91; P = 0.005).

In 90-day mortality (Table 2), crude HRs were 12.41
(95% CI, 2.80 to 54.98; P = 0.001) in group 2, 7.44 (95% CI,

considered as a reference group (Unadjusted Model). As in
the analysis of 28-day mortality, group 4 also exhibited a

significantly higher 90-day mortality risk even after adjust￾ing for age, sex, SOFA score, CCI, RRT, serum albumin,
Hb, lactate, CRP, and infection site (HR, 11.66; 95% CI,
2.57 to 52.97; P = 0.001 in Model 1, HR, 13.74; 95% CI,
2.95 to 64.10; P = 0.001 in Model 2). In addition, the ad￾justed risk of 90-day mortality was 4.8-fold higher in group
3 (P = 0.040 in Model 2), compared to group 1, which was
inconsistent with the analysis of 28-day mortality. On the
other hand, although the adjusted risk of 90-day mortality
was approximately 4.7-fold higher in group 2, it did not
reach a statistical significance (P = 0.050 in Model 2).
Moreover, the Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were examined
to assure the goodness of fit of statistical models and the
P values for 28-day and 90-day mortality in model 2 were
shown to be 0.913 and 0.769, respectively. In addition, the
proportional hazards assumption of the four groups,
stratified by baseline RDW value and ΔRDW72hr-adm, were
verified through the parallel lines of the log-minus-log￾survival plots.
An increase in RDW from baseline was significantly
associated with total length of hospital stay
Two hundred and seventy-three patients (83.0%) were dis￾charged alive from the hospital, and the median TLHS was
14 days. Group 1 exhibited significantly shorter TLHS than
group 4 (14.3 ± 11.7 vs. 44.2 ± 64.3 days; P <0.001) (Table 1).
Moreover, multivariate linear regression analysis demon￾strated that an increase in RDW were significantly asso￾ciated with TLHS (β = 25.45; 95% CI, 14.69 to 36.21;
P <0.001 in group 4) (Table 3).

Discussion
The present study is a prospective clinical investigation
of the prognostic value of changes in RDW in patients
receiving a standardized resuscitation algorithm (EGDT)
for severe sepsis or septic shock. The impact of changes
in RDW during the first 72 hours after ED admission
on all-cause mortality was analyzed by categorizing the
patients into four groups according to baseline RDW
value and ΔRDW72hr-adm (RDW at 72 hours – RDW at
baseline). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first to report that an increase in RDW has a potential
role in predicting mortality in patients with severe sepsis
or septic shock. The main finding of the present study is
that an increase in RDW from baseline during the first
72 hours after hospitalization can serve as a strong inde￾pendent predictor of mortality in patients with severe
sepsis or septic shock. This significant association be￾tween an increase in RDW and mortality remained un￾altered even after adjusting for various confounding
variables. Group 4 patients, those with increased RDW
at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2%, exhibited the high￾est risks in 28-day and 90-day mortality, while group 1
patients, those with normal RDW level at baseline and
ΔRDW72hr-adm ≤0.2%, had the lowest mortality risks.
Thus, we speculate that RDW is a dynamic marker of
risk in septic patients, and that an increase in RDW dur￾ing the course of hospitalization can serve as an early in￾dicator of adverse outcomes.
Interestingly, in multivariate analysis for 90-day mor￾tality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed
in group 3 in which RDW increased within 72 hours
after ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and
ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2%) compared to group 1, while
there was an insignificant difference between group 1
and 3 in 28-day mortality. These findings demonstrate
that the relationship between an increase in RDW and
mortality may be more meaningful, when the follow-up
duration is longer.
Although the mechanism underlying the association
between higher RDW and mortality in septic patients is
not yet completely understood, several plausible explana￾tions have been suggested in previous studies. Systemic in￾flammation has been shown to predict progressive illness,
cardiovascular mortality and death in ICU patients. Sys￾temic inflammation response impacts bone marrow func￾tion and iron metabolism [20,21], and proinflammatory
cytokines have been found to inhibit erythropoietin￾induced erythrocyte maturation and proliferation, and to
downregulate erythropoietin receptor expression, which
are associated with RDW increases [22]. Oxidative stress
may also be a contributing factor of the association be￾tween RDW and mortality. High oxidative stress is present
in sepsis through the generation of reactive oxygen species
by activated leukocytes [23]. Moreover, it has been pro￾posed that oxidative stress induces an increase in RDW by
reducing RBC survival and increasing the release of large
premature RBCs into the peripheral circulation [24]. An￾other explanation may be related to malnutrition. Nutri￾tional markers, including total cholesterol and albumin,
are believed to be significantly associated with RDW [13].
In addition, RDW has also been noted to be associated
with renal dysfunction, which is known to be closely re￾lated with inflammation and malnutrition [13,25]. Re￾cently, Veeranna et al. [26] demonstrated the predictive
ability of RDW for HbA1c in healthy nondiabetic adults,
proposing the possibility of chronic hyperglycemia along
with oxidative stress and inflammation as mediators of the
association between RDW and adverse outcomes. All
things considered, it is reasonable to assume that in￾creased RDW may represent an integrative measure of the
multiple harmful pathologic processes, including inflam￾mation, oxidative stress, malnutrition, and renal dysfunc￾tion, that simultaneously occur in critical illness. Thus,
with respect to the results of this study, we suggest that
changes in RDW, especially increasing RDW, reflect the
aggravation of inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional
deficiencies, and renal dysfunction, and that the combin￾ation of a baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW

can be a promising independent prognostic marker in sep￾tic patients. However, inflammation, oxidative stress, nu￾tritional deficiencies, and renal dysfunction may not
entirely explain why increased RDW is associated with
mortality and greater length of hospital stay, because these
associations were still significant even after adjusting for
total cholesterol, albumin, and SOFA score; therefore fur￾ther study is needed to determine the mechanism for the
association between RDW values and mortality.
There are several limitations to our study. First, we
arbitrarily determined 72 hours after ED admission as
the second RDW measurement and defined an increase
in RDW as ΔRDW72hr-adm >0.2%. Whether changes in
RDW during the first 72 hours could represent the path￾ophysiologic changes and therapeutic responses in critic￾ally ill patients is not clear. Ku et al. [27] suggested that
72-hour RDW after the onset of bacteremia could be a
predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with Gram￾negative bacteremia. Therefore, based on this previous
study, we investigated the clinical outcomes of the pa￾tients with severe and/or septic shock stratified by the
changes in RDW values between baseline and 72 hours
after admission. Second, we did not investigate the use
of erythropoietin, iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, and re￾ticulocyte count, which could have affected RDW values
and, thus, might have limited the interpretation of study
results. Third, the low number of patients in group 4
might introduce significant interference in the use of
statistical models with numerous covariates. We exam￾ined two aspects of our models to assure the goodness
of fit of our statistical models. For one thing, we con￾ducted multivariate logistic regression analyses with the
covariates used in Adjusted Model 2 and examined the
results of the Hosmer-Lemeshow tests. Therefore, we
confirmed that the P values for 28-day and 90-day mor￾tality were 0.913 and 0.769, respectively, which demon￾strated that these statistical analyses with numerous
variables were acceptable. Next, we examined the pro￾portional hazards assumption of the four groups, strati￾fied by baseline RDW value and ΔRDW72hr-adm, through
log-minus-log-survival plot, and the parallel lines of the
log-minus-log function were verified. Taken together, we
suggested that these statistical analyses were tolerable,
even though the number of patients in group 4 was rela￾tively small. Furthermore, we analyzed the data with a
simplified grouping in the same frame of statistical
models. Patients were categorized into four groups based
on whether RDW level was within the normal range or
increased at baseline and at 72 hours. Group 1 was de￾fined as patients with normal RDW at both time points,
group 2 as patients with increased RDW at baseline and
normal RDW at 72 hours, group 3 as patients with nor￾mal RDW and increased RDW at 72 hours, and group 4
as patients with increased RDW at both time points. In
the results, we found that an increase in RDW from
baseline was significantly associated with mortality.
Moreover, group 4 in this subanalysis exhibited the high￾est 28-day and 90-day mortality rates similar to our out￾comes (See Additional files 1 and 2). Finally, the sample
size and the number of events were not large enough to
establish statistical significance of increased risk among
categorized groups. Therefore, a larger multicenter study
with repeated RDW measurements is necessary to fur￾ther clarify the predictive value of changes in RDW.
Conclusions
We found that an increase in RDW from baseline during
the first 72 hours after hospitalization is significantly asso￾ciated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, a com￾bination of baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW
can be a promising independent prognostic marker for
mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Al￾though further research is required to determine the pre￾cise mechanisms underlying the association between RDW
and mortality, this study provides support for future inves￾tigations considering changes of RDW and the associated
stratification of critically ill patients at risk for mortality.
Key messages
 The changes in RDW from baseline can reflect
acute disease states and provide more prognostic
information than the baseline RDW value alone.
 In this single-center prospective observational
study including 329 patients, an increase in RDW
from baseline during the first 72 hours after
hospitalization is significantly associated with adverse
clinical outcomes in patients with severe sepsis and
septic shock.
 A combination of baseline RDW value and changes
in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic
marker for mortality in patients with severe sepsis
or septic shock.
