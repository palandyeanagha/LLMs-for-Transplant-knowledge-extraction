Organ transplant recipients taking immunosuppressive drugs are at
an estimated 65-fold greater risk of squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) and a 10-fold higher risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
(McCann, 1999). Agents used to prevent allograft rejection
include cyclosporine or azathioprine, often combined with gluco￾corticoids. Systemic glucocorticoids alone (e.g., prednisone, pred￾nisolone, dexamethasone and cortisone) are widely used for a
variety of medical conditions including connective tissue diseases,
musculoskeletal disorders and allergies. However, it is presently
unknown whether these patients are at an increased risk of NMSC.
Therefore, we examined the potential risks of SCC and BCC asso￾ciated with glucocorticoid use in non-transplant recipients, as part
of a population-based case-control study of NMSC conducted in
New Hampshire, USA. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study group 
To identify cases for our study, we enlisted the collaboration of
dermatologists and pathology laboratories throughout New
Hampshire and bordering regions (Karagas et al, 1999). We
selected a random sample of BCC cases (for efficiency) and all
cases of invasive SCC diagnosed from July 1, 1993 through June
30, 1995 among New Hampshire residents, aged 25–74 years. The
sample of BCC cases was drawn concomitantly with the SCC
cases and controls, and stratified on anatomic site, age and gender
to ensure representation of the entire group of BCC diagnoses. As
of March 1996, we identified 1143 potential participants. One
patient was not contacted at the physician’s request, 31 (3%) were
reported as deceased by a household member or physician, 10
(1%) lived in households in which no one answered after 40
attempts to telephone distributed over days, evenings and week￾ends, 178 (16%) declined participation and 27 (2%) were deemed
mentally incompetent or too ill to take part. We interviewed a total
of 603 BCC and 293 SCC cases. 
We chose controls from New Hampshire residents aged 25–74
years who were frequency-matched on age (25–34, 35–44, 45–54,
55–64, 65–69, 70–74 years) and gender to represent the combined
distribution of the SCC and BCC cases. We selected controls
(roughly equal in number to the number of BCC cases) from lists
of New Hampshire residents provided by the New Hampshire
Department of Transportation (for those less than 65 years old)
and Health Care Financing Administration’s Medicare Program
(for those 65 years and older). For interviewing purposes, controls
were randomly assigned reference dates comparable to the cases’
diagnosis dates. Of the 820 potential controls, 12 (2%) were
reported as deceased by a member of the household, for 12 (2%),
no one answered in the household after 40 attempts to telephone
distributed over days, evenings and weekends, 228 (28%) declined
participation and 28 (3%) were deemed mentally incompetent or
too ill to take part. We thus interviewed 540 controls for the study.

Summary Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is an important cause of morbidity and long-term mortality in organ transplant recipients
receiving immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine and cyclosporin, often combined with adrenocortical steroids (glucocorticoids). At
lower doses, glucocorticoids alone are prescribed for other conditions including musculoskeletal, connective tissue and respiratory disorders.
Presently, it is unknown whether patients taking glucocorticoids are at an increased risk of skin malignances. In a population-based case￾control study in New Hampshire, USA, we compared use of glucocorticoids in 592 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 281 squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) cases and in 532 age and gender matched controls; neither cases nor controls had a history of organ transplantation.
Participants underwent a structured personal interview regarding history of medication use and skin cancer risk factors. We used
unconditional logistic regression analysis to compute odds ratios associated with glucocorticoid use for 1 month or longer while controlling for
potential confounding factors. Risk of SCC was increased among users of oral glucocorticoids (adjusted odds ratio = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.27,
4.18), and risk of BCC was elevated modestly (adjusted odds ratio = 1.49; 95% CI = 0.90, 2.47). In contrast, risk of both SCC and BCC were
unrelated to use of inhaled steroids. Our data suggest that use of oral glucocorticoids may increase risk of NMSC, and SCC in particular,
among patients other than organ transplant recipients. We hypothesize that immunosuppression induced by oral glucocorticoids may allow
these cancers to emerge from immunosurveillance. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com

College. Study participants completed a structured personal inter￾view, usually at their homes. Questions included sociodemo￾graphic information (level of education), skin sensitivity to the sun
after first exposure in the summer (i.e., tendency to sunburn),
previous radiation treatment, use of tobacco, and time spent
outdoors during working and non-working hours in the summer
and the rest of the year. We asked participants if their doctor had
ever prescribed corticosteroids or steroids as pills, injections or
inhalers for 1 month or longer. We then asked the age they were
first treated, condition for which the corticosteroids were
prescribed, the name of the drug, dose, and the duration of treat￾ment. To aid recall, we developed a list of glucocorticoid drugs
(trade name, generic name and description) and a pictorial guide
showing the most commonly used drugs grouped by pill colour,
size and shape. To minimize potential reporting bias, we did not
reveal the specific hypotheses of interest to either the interviewer
or participant, and we did not inform the interviewers of the case￾control status of participants. 
Statistical analysis 
We computed the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI) of BCC and SCC associated with use of glucocorticoids prior
to the reference date using unconditional logistic regression,
taking into account multiple confounding factors (Breslow and
Day, 1980). In addition to age and gender, we assessed the poten￾tially confounding effects of skin reaction to the sun (severe
sunburn with blistering, painful sunburn, mild sunburn with some
tanning and tanning with no sunburn), radiation treatment (no,
yes), cigarette smoking history (never, former, current), and level
of education (less than college, college, graduate/professional
school). All relative risk estimates of SCC risk were adjusted for
age, gender and sun sensitivity, and estimates of BCC for age and
gender. No other factors appreciably influenced the results. 
RESULTS 
A total of 592 BCC, 281 SCC and 532 controls had available infor￾mation on previous glucocorticoid use and no known history of an
organ transplantation (4 BCC, 8 SCC and no controls had an organ
transplant). Of the remaining subjects, SCC cases were older on
average than BCC cases or controls (Table 1). A higher proportion
of BCC and SCC cases than controls reported a tendency to
sunburn, a history of radiation treatment, and graduate or profes￾sional school education (Table 1). The overall average number of
hours spent outdoors during the summer months either recreation￾ally or occupationally was roughly similar for SCC and BCC cases
and controls (Table 1). 
Overall, 13% of SCC cases, 10% of BCC cases and 8% of
controls reported using inhaled or oral glucocorticoids for one
month or longer (Table 1). The distribution of medical indications
for glucocorticoid therapy did not differ notably between cases and
controls (Table 1). Women reported using glucocorticoids more
often than men (12.7% of women versus 8.9% of men); however,
age, sun sensitivity, time spent outdoors, and level of educational
attainment varied little according to glucocorticoid use (data not
shown). Prednisone accounted for more than 80% of reported use
of oral glucocorticoids. 
Use of oral, but not inhaled glucocorticoids, was associated with
an increased risk of both SCC and BCC. For SCC, risk was
elevated more than two-fold (adjusted odds ratio = 2.31; 95% 
CI = 1.27, 4.18; P = 0.01) and was stronger for current than prior
use (Table 2). We did not detect a trend in SCC risk with duration
of use, but relatively few subjects indicated using glucocorticoids
for more than 6 months (Table 2). Risk of BCC risk was modestly,
and not clearly, elevated (adjusted odds ratio = 1.49; 95% CI =
0.90, 2.47; P = 0.12). Cases and controls reported a similar preva￾lence of inhaled glucocorticoid use (adjusted odds ratio for BCC =
0.76, 95% CI = 0.39, 1.47; P = 0.49; adjusted odds ratio for SCC =
1.44, 95% CI = 0.68, 3.05; P = 0.36). 
DISCUSSION 
Long-term immunosuppressive therapy to prevent allograft rejec￾tion markedly increases the occurrence of NMSCs. In organ trans￾plant recipients, reported relative risks of NMSC range from 7 to
as high as 250 (Blohme and Larko, 1984; Dyall-Smith and Ross,
1995; Gupta et al, 1986; Hartevelt et al, 1990; Hoxtell et al, 1977;
Jensen et al, 1999; Kinlen, 1996; O’Connell et al, 1986; Sheiner
et al, 2000). Treatment to prevent allograft rejection usually
includes a multi-agent regimen of a cytotoxic drug (e.g., azathio￾prine), an agent affecting signal transduction in T-lymphocytes
(e.g., cyclosporin), often combined with a glucocorticoid (e.g.,
prednisone), which suppresses T-cell proliferation and immune
response. Other groups of patients use glucocorticoids alone, but
at lower doses and generally for shorter durations. In our study,
these individuals had an increased risk of SCC, and possibly of
BCC, albeit to a lesser extent than that experienced by organ trans￾plant recipients. 
There are a few reports of NMSC among patients using
immunosuppressive drugs for conditions other than organ trans￾plantation. Kinlen and colleagues observed three cases of SCC
versus 0.60 expected in a series of 1634 patients without trans￾plants who were treated with azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or
chlorambucil (Kinlen, 1996). In a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis
patients, skin cancer occurred in 19 out of 119 of the cyclophos￾phamide-treated patients (3 SCC cases) compared to 6 out of 119
patients not receiving cyclophosphamide (one SCC case) (Radis
et al, 1995). In our study, we did not specifically ask subjects
whether they took cyclophosphamide or other immunosuppressive
agents. Nonetheless, our results for patients who reported taking
glucocorticoids (and potentially combined with other agents), are
consistent with prior studies on cyclophosphamide and other
agents used in non-transplant recipients. 
In contrast to the enhanced NMSC risk associated with oral
glucocorticoids, we found no association between inhaled gluco￾corticoids and risk of either SCC or BCC. This result is not
surprising, since inhaled glucocorticoids have limited systemic
effects (Hardman et al, 1996). The fact that cases and controls
were about equally likely to report using inhaled glucocorticoids
suggests that NMSC cases do not report more use of drugs in
general, or that increased surveillance for skin cancer among
patients with chronic diseases can explain the observed association
between oral glucocorticoids and NMSC. We did not note any
particular condition for which NMSC patients reported taking
glucocorticoids more than controls; however, the number of cases
in each category was small. 
The excess incidence of NMSCs seen in organ transplant recip￾ients is likely due to the immunodeficient state itself. In a cohort
study of 1098 renal transplant recipients, the excess NMSC risk
occurred irrespective of the type of immunosuppressive therapy
used (Bouwes Bavinck et al, 1996). Further, in a report of 2562

heart and kidney recipients, the magnitude of the NMSC risk
related to the degree of drug-induced immunosuppression (Jensen
et al, 1999). In animal experiments, immunosuppression produced
by exposure to ultraviolet light plays a mechanistic role in skin
carcinogenesis (Kripke, 1994). 
Physicians prescribe glucocorticoids for patients with a variety
of medical conditions because of their immunosuppressive and
anti-inflammatory effects (Hardman et al, 1996), and in our study,
about 8% of population controls reported using glucocorticoids for
one month or longer. NMSC is a frequent and growing problem in
Caucasian populations (Coebergh et al, 1991; Gallagher et al,
1990; Kaldor et al, 1993; Karagas et al, 1999; Levi et al, 1995;
Staples et al, 1998). Our data along with others require further
confirmation and indicate that glucocorticoids may contribute to
NMSC occurrence.
