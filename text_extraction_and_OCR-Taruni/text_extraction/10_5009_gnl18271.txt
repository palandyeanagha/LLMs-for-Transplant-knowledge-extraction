Background/Aims: Recently reported prognostic models 
for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) have been shown to be 
effective in Western populations but have not been well￾validated in Asian patients. This study aimed to compare the 
performance of prognostic models in Korean patients and to 
investigate whether inflammation-based scores can further 
help in prognosis prediction. Methods: This study included 
271 consecutive patients diagnosed with PBC in Korea. The 
following prognostic models were evaluated: the Barcelona 
model, the Paris-I/II model, the Rotterdam criteria, the GLOBE 
score and the UK-PBC score. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) was analyzed with reference to its association 
with prognosis. Results: For predicting liver transplant or 
death at the 5-year and 10-year follow-up examinations, the 
UK-PBC score (areas under the receiver operating character￾istic curve [AUCs], 0.88 and 0.82) and GLOBE score (AUCs, 
0.85 and 0.83) were significantly more accurate in predicting 
prognosis than the other scoring systems (all p<0.05). There 
was no significant difference between the performance of 
the UK-PBC and GLOBE scores. In addition to the prognostic 
models, a high NLR (>2.46) at baseline was an independent 
predictor of reduced transplant-free survival in the multivari￾ate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.74; p<0.01). When the 
NLR was applied to the prognostic models, it significantly 
differentiated the prognosis of patients. Conclusions: The 
UK-PBC and GLOBE scores showed good prognostic perfor￾mance in Korean patients with PBC. In addition, a high NLR 
was associated with a poorer prognosis. Including the NLR in 
prognostic models may further help to stratify patients with 
PBC. (Gut Liver 2018;12:714-721)

INTRODUCTION
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver 
disease characterized by chronic cholestasis.1
 Without appropri￾ate treatment, it can proceed to liver cirrhosis and is one of the 
major causes of liver transplantation (LT) in Western countries.2 
Standard treatment for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), 
but approximately 30% of patients with PBC do not respond to 
this treatment, resulting in poor prognosis and the need for LT 
or, in the worst-case scenario, death.2
 Therefore, it is important 
to identify a biomarker that can predict patients who do not 
respond to UDCA therapy or whose prognosis is poor. In order 
to predict the prognosis of patients with PBC, various criteria 
such as the Paris-I, Paris-II, and Barcelona criteria have been 
developed.3-5 These criteria serve to classify PBC patients as re￾sponders or non-responders after 1 or 2 years of UDCA therapy. 
Recently, the UK-PBC risk score and the GLOBE score have been 
developed, allowing more accurate prediction of the prognosis 
of PBC patients than previous scoring systems.6,7 However, it 
is not yet clear whether these scoring systems are acceptable 
for Asian patients, as the UK-PBC score was developed for 
British patients and the GLOBE score for North American and 
European subjects. There is a possibility that the prognosis dif￾fers geographically, as the prevalence of PBC varies in different 
countries.

Yoo JJ, et al: Validation of PBC Prognostic Models and Role of NLR 715
Inflammation is a principal feature of chronic liver disease 
and predisposition to liver cirrhosis. Therefore, inflammation￾based scores may be potentially useful to predict disease pro￾gression. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have recently been shown 
to be prognostic markers for various inflammatory diseases 
and cancers, but associations with PBC have not yet been pub￾lished.8,9
The aim of this study was to compare and validate the prog￾nostic performance of various PBC prognostic models including 
the UK-PBC and GLOBE scores in Korean patients, and to evalu￾ate the impact of inflammation-based scores on PBC prognosis, 
represented by NLR and PLR. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Patients 
Between January 2000 and December 2016, we collected 
the data from consecutive PBC patients data obtained during 
routine clinical care in two tertiary hospitals (Seoul National 
University Hospital and Soonchunhyang University Bucheon 
Hospital). PBC was diagnosed when two or more of the follow￾ing three criteria were met: (1) cholestatic pattern of liver func￾tion abnormality; (2) positivity for anti-mitochondrial antibod￾ies (AMA); and (3) consistency with PBC in liver biopsy.2
 For 
the current study, only patients with complete laboratory values 
after 1 year of UDCA therapy were included. Exclusion criteria 
were as follows: evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, al￾coholic liver disease, or primary sclerosing cholangitis or other 
liver disease including Wilson’s disease or hemochromatosis. 
Finally, we retrospectively included 271 patients who met the 
inclusion criteria (Supplementary Fig. 1). In these patients, we 
compared the following six different prognostic models; Bar￾celona criteria,3
 Paris-I criteria,4
 Paris-II criteria,5
 Rotterdam,10
GLOBE score,6
 and UK-PBC score.7
 Clinical and laboratory re￾cords of all patients were reviewed at baseline, and at 1-year, 
5-year and 10-year follow-up examinations. The reference 
ranges for laboratory values of each hospital are described in 
Supplementary Table 1.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of each hospital, and the informed consent was waived. 
The study protocol also conformed to the ethical guidelines of 
the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. 
2. Definitions
Transplantation-free survival (TFS) was defined as the time 
from PBC diagnosis to LT or death. Decompensated liver disease 
was defined if any of the following were found during baseline 
or the observational period: ascites, variceal hemorrhage, he￾patic encephalopathy, or jaundice more than three times that of 
the upper limit of normal (ULN).11,12
NLR was measured by dividing the absolute neutrophil count 
by the lymphocyte count, and PLR was defined as the absolute 
platelet count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count in a 
complete blood count test.13
3. Statistical analysis
Frequencies and percentages were used for descriptive statis￾tics. Statistical differences between the groups were investigated 
using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical 
variables and the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for 
continuous variables. Survival rate was estimated using the

Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the curves were 
compared using the log-rank test. The optimal cutoff value for 
continuous variable was determined using the “maxstat” pack￾age, a maximal chi-square method in open source software R. 
To evaluate the predictive accuracy of each prognostic model, 
the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves for censored data and the areas under the ROC curve 
(AUC) were constructed according to Heagerty et al.
14 All sta￾tistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.3; The R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and sta￾tistical significance was defined as a p<0.05.

of AMA was 89.3% (242) and the mean Model for End-Stage 
Liver Disease (MELD) score was 8.1±3.1. Patients were divided 
into two groups: patients with good prognosis who survived￾without LT and patients with poor prognosis who underwent 
LT or died. A total of 228 patients (84.1%) were included in the 
good prognosis group, and 43 patients (15.9%) formed the poor 
prognosis group. The poor prognosis group comprised older 
patients at the time of PBC diagnosis, who had deteriorated 
liver function. The MELD score and NLR score were higher in 
patients in the poor prognosis group compared to those in the 
good prognosis group. Otherwise, there were no significant dif￾ferences in sex and AMA positivity between the two groups. 
Patients received standard UDCA treatment according to their 
body weight, and the mean UDCA dose was 750 mg per day. 
The biochemical changes before and 1 year after UDCA treat￾ment are described in Table 2. After UDCA treatment, levels of 
liver enzymes (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl 
transferase) were significantly lower compared to before treat￾ment, which applied to both the good and poor prognosis 
groups. Platelet counts and PLR scores also significantly de￾creased after 1 year, especially in the poor prognosis group. 
The median observation time of the patients was 74 months 
(interquartile range, 36 to 109 months). During the observation￾al period, 31 patients (11.4%) progressed into decompensation, 
33 (12.2%) died (26 from liver-related causes and seven from 
other causes), and 10 (3.7%) underwent LT. The overall TFS rate 
was 91% at 5 years, 77% at 10 years, and 69% at 15 years.
2. Comparison of the prognostic performance for each 
model
We examined whether the six models of PBC prognosis dif￾ferentiated the actual outcome of the patients using the log￾rank test. The threshold of GLOBE score (>0.30) for biochemical 
non-response was based on the original article.6
 As there is no 
specific risk threshold presented for UK-PBC, patients were di￾chotomized according to the median value of our study cohort. 
As expected, all the models except for the Barcelona criteria 
showed significantly different parameters in patients with good 
outcome compared to those with poor outcomes (all p<0.001) 
(Fig. 1). However, the Barcelona score failed to show a statisti￾cally significant difference between the two groups when ap￾plied to our patient population (p=0.086). Next, we compared 
the predictive performance power of TFS for each model at the 
5-year follow-up and 10-year follow-up. When the performanc￾es of the models were compared, the UK-PBC and GLOBE scores 
showed significantly better discrimination, as indicated by the 
area-under the curves (AUCs) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.80 to 0.95) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.96) than the Paris￾I (AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80), Paris-II (AUC, 0.75; 95% CI, 
0.67 to 0.84), Rotterdam (AUC, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.73) and 
Barcelona criteria (AUC, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.71) for predict￾ing transplant or death within 5 years (all p<0.05) (Fig. 2A). The 
difference between the UK-PBC and GLOBE scores was not sta￾tistically significant (p=0.65). The performances of the UK-PBC 
and GLOBE scores for predicting events within 10 years were 
similar (AUCs, 0.82; 95% CIs, 0.75 to 0.90 and AUCs, 0.83; 95% 
CI, 0.75 to 0.92; p=0.86, respectively) and significantly better 
than the other criteria (all p<0.05). The time-dependent AUCs 
for the overall predictive ability of the UK-PBC and GLOBE 
scores were 0.76 and 0.74, respectively, whereas the other 
criteria showed limited performance (all AUCs <0.7) (Fig. 2B). 
3. Association with inflammation and PBC prognosis
Finally, we analyzed the relationship between inflammation￾based scores and PBC prognosis. NLR analyzed as continuous 
variable was significantly associated with TFS in the univariate 
analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.78; p=0.001), 
whereas the PLR showed no statistical significance (p=0.25). 
Using the maximal chi-square method, the optimal cutoff of 
NLR to predict prognosis was 2.46. According to the cutoff 
point, Kaplan-Meier estimates are shown in Fig. 3. Because of 
the small number of events, the median TFS could not be esti￾mated for either group. However, patients with high NLR levels 
(>2.46) had a significantly higher risk of LT or death compared 
with patient with low NLR levels (≤2.46; HR, 4.85; 95% CI, 2.48 
to 9.51; p<0.001). In addition, when NLR with a cutoff of 2.46 
was applied to the six models, it significantly discriminated the 
prognosis of patients (Supplementary Fig. 2). When multivariate 
analyzes of factors affecting the prognosis of PBC patients were 
performed, a high NLR (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.53 to 9.18; p=0.004) 
and the GLOBE score (HR, 4.03, 95% CI, 2.85 to 5.72, p<0.001) 
were independent prognostic factors for shorter TFS, along with

the MELD score (Table 3, model 1). If the UK-PBC score was in￾corporated in the analysis instead of the GLOBE score (model 2), 
a high NLR was also independently associated with shorter TFS 
(HR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.67 to 10.55; p=0.002) as well as UK-PBC 
score (HR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.90 to 5.49; p<0.001), MELD score 
and age. 
DISCUSSION
Our study validated the prognostic values of six biochemical 
response models of PBC in Koreans, and showed that high NLR 
level at baseline was associated with future risk of poor out￾come, independently of UDCA response. As far as we know, our 
investigation includes the largest number of Korean patients in 
a multicenter validation study.
Eight prognostic models for PBC have been published so 
far.6,7,15 Among them, we were unable to analyze the Toronto or 
the Mayo model because of lack of retrospective data (i.e., labo￾ratory findings after 2-year UDCA, and presence of peripheral 
edema). Therefore, six prognostic models were assessed in our 
study. Among them, the Barcelona criteria showed lower pre￾dictive power than the other prognostic models. With regard to 
endpoints, the Barcelona criteria has been developed to predict 
overall survival,3
 whereas the other scoring systems have been 
developed to predict TFS. Therefore, the low performance of the 
Barcelona criteria for the prediction of TFS is probably due to 
different endpoint. Also, the Barcelona criteria has shown some￾what low predictive power than the Paris or Mayo model in the 
previous study.16 For the recently developed GLOBE and UK￾PBC scores, they are more predictive than the previous models, 
using continuous variables instead of categorical variables. In 
addition, most of the other models are based on the laboratory 
data collected 1-year after taking UDCA, and the GLOBE and 
UK-PBC scores use laboratory values from two points (baseline 
and 1-year after talking UDCA), which make them more precise. 
Due to this feature, although both models were developed for 
Western people, they may have high predictive power in Asians, 
together.17 However, because the cutoff of GLOBE score for non￾response group was determined based on the reference popula￾tion data from the Netherlands, the appropriate cutoff point in 
Korean patients should be evaluated in a future study. 
It is now known that inflammation is one of the major patho￾physiological mechanisms for the development and progression 
of PBC.18,19 Especially in recent years, the terms have changed 
from “primary biliary cirrhosis” to “primary biliary cholangitis,” 
which, by definition, tends to focus more on the inflammation 
of bile ducts.2
 NLR is a value that has been recently identified 
in relation to systemic inflammation, and has been extensively 
studied in cancer and cardiovascular disease.20-22 In relation to 
liver disease, the potential of NLR as a predictor of advanced 
histology or prognosis has been reported in hepatitis B virus and 
hepatitis C virus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.9,23,24 How￾ever, with regard to PBC, only one cohort study has reported 
the association of high NLR and short-term (1-year) mortality in 
hospitalized patients with PBC.25 Consistent with this, our study 
proved the value of NLR for the prediction of long-term prog￾nosis. 
The cutoff values of NLR differ greatly for disease entity, 
being 5.0 for liver cancer, and 5.7 for acute-on-chronic liver 
failure (ACLF)-induced decompensation.26 In ACLF-induced 
decompensation, NLR even showed significantly better predict￾ability than the MELD, which thus shows potential for NLR as 
a promising biomarker.27 In the present study, the cutoff NLR 
value was about 2.4, indicating that the degree of inflammation 
was comparatively lower than that of cancer or ACLF.
Taken together, our findings suggest that the combination of

pre-existing models, for example, the GLOBE or UK-PBC scores 
with inflammatory markers such as NLR may be more predic￾tive for the prognosis of PBC. Indeed, one of the AMA markers, 
gp210, has been reported to help predict prognosis, to some ex￾tent, and to help optimize the GLOBE score in Chinese patients.16
In the case of the article in question, however, the endpoint is a 
complication of cirrhosis, and is therefore slightly different from 
our study where the endpoint is TFS. In this study, high NLR 
level at baseline was able to independently predict poor out￾come, even after adjusting for UK-PBC or GLOBE scores. Fur￾thermore, in the subgroup with a predicted favorable outcome 
according to UK-PBC or GLOBE scores at 1-year, high NLR was 
able to identify those who are still at risk of poor outcome. The 
additional value of NLR supports efforts to further optimize 
model for decision making in clinical practice.
In conclusion, the UK-PBC and GLOBE scores seem to be 
good indicators of prognosis regardless of race or ethnicity. In 
addition, NLR may further help in the stratification of patients 
via capturing different perspectives of PBC by focusing on in￾flammation.
