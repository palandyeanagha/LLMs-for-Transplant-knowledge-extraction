iv NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme
The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme, part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), was 
set up in 1993. It produces high-quality research information on the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of health 
technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS. ‘Health technologies’ are broadly defined as all 
interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.
The research findings from the HTA programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee (NSC). HTA findings also 
help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they form a key component of the ‘National 
Knowledge Service’.
The HTA programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three routes to the 
start of projects.
First is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the NHS, from 
the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts. These suggestions 
are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service users). The HTA programme then 
commissions the research by competitive tender.
Second, the HTA programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research questions. These 
are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.
Third, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA programme commissions 
bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together evidence on the value of 
specific technologies.
Some HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They can cost from as 
little as £40,000 to over £1 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, undertaking a trial, or other research 
collecting new data to answer a research problem.
The final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before publication in 
the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.
Criteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series
Reports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme, and 
(2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors.
Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search, appraisal and 
synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication of the review 
by others.
The research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the National Coordinating Centre for 
Research Methodology (NCCRM), and was formally transferred to the HTA programme in April 2007 under the 
newly established NIHR Methodology Panel. The HTA programme project number is 06/91/10. The contractual start 
date was in October 2005. The draft report began editorial review in March 2011 and was accepted for publication in 
August 2011. The commissioning brief was devised by the NCCRM who specified the research question and study 
design. The authors have been wholly responsible for all data collection, analysis and interpretation, and for writing 
up their work. The HTA editors and publisher have tried to ensure the accuracy of the authors’ report and would like 
to thank the referees for their constructive comments on the draft document. However, they do not accept liability for 
damages or losses arising from material published in this report.
The views expressed in this publication are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the HTA programme or the 
Department of Health.

Background: The design of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should incorporate 
characteristics (such as concealment of randomised allocation and blinding of participants 
and personnel) that avoid biases resulting from lack of comparability of the intervention and 
control groups. Empirical evidence suggests that the absence of such characteristics leads 
to biased intervention effect estimates, but the findings of different studies are 
not consistent.
Objectives: To examine the influence of unclear or inadequate random sequence 
generation and allocation concealment, and unclear or absent double blinding, on 
intervention effect estimates and between-trial heterogeneity, and whether or not these 
influences vary with type of clinical area, intervention, comparison and outcome measure.

vi Abstract
Data sources and methods: Data were combined from seven contributing meta￾epidemiological studies (collections of meta-analyses in which trial characteristics are 
assessed and results recorded). The resulting database was used to identify and remove 
overlapping meta-analyses. Outcomes were coded such that odds ratios <1 correspond to 
beneficial intervention effects. Outcome measures were classified as mortality, other 
objective or subjective. We examined agreement between assessments of trial 
characteristics in trials assessed in more than one contributing study. We used hierarchical 
Bayesian bias models to estimate the effect of trial characteristics on average bias 
[quantified as ratios of odds ratios (RORs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) comparing 
trials with and without a characteristic] and in increasing between-trial heterogeneity.
Results: The analysis data set contained 1973 trials included in 234 meta-analyses. 
Median kappa statistics for agreement between assessments of trial characteristics were: 
sequence generation 0.60, allocation concealment 0.58 and blinding 0.87. Intervention 
effect estimates were exaggerated by an average 11% in trials with inadequate or unclear 
(compared with adequate) sequence generation (ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.82 to 0.96); 
between-trial heterogeneity was higher among such trials. Bias associated with inadequate 
or unclear sequence generation was greatest for subjective outcomes (ROR 0.83, 95% CrI 
0.74 to 0.94) and the increase in heterogeneity was greatest for such outcomes [standard 
deviation (SD) 0.20, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.32]. The effect of inadequate or unclear (compared 
with adequate) allocation concealment was greatest among meta-analyses with a 
subjectively assessed outcome intervention effect (ROR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.75 to 0.95), and 
the increase in between-trial heterogeneity was also greatest for such outcomes (SD 0.20, 
95% CrI 0.02 to 0.33). Lack of, or unclear, double blinding (compared with double blinding) 
was associated with an average 13% exaggeration of intervention effects (ROR 0.87, 95% 
CrI 0.79 to 0.96), and between-trial heterogeneity was increased for such studies (SD 0.14, 
95% CrI 0.02 to 0.30). Average bias (ROR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.65 to 0.92) and between-trial 
heterogeneity (SD 0.37, 95% CrI 0.19 to 0.53) were greatest for meta-analyses assessing 
subjective outcomes. Among meta-analyses with subjectively assessed outcomes, the 
effect of lack of blinding appeared greater than the effect of inadequate or unclear 
sequence generation or allocation concealment.
Conclusions: Bias associated with specific reported study design characteristics leads to 
exaggeration of beneficial intervention effect estimates and increases in between-trial 
heterogeneity. For each of the three characteristics assessed, these effects were greatest 
for subjectively assessed outcomes. Assessments of the risk of bias in RCTs should 
account for these findings. Further research is needed to understand the effects of attrition 
bias, as well as the relative importance of blinding of patients, care-givers and outcome 
assessors, and thus separate the effects of performance and detection bias.

Executive summary
Background
Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the best evidence for clinical 
and policy decision-making about medical interventions. The design of RCTs should incorporate 
characteristics (such as concealment of randomised allocation and blinding of participants 
and personnel) that avoid biases resulting from lack of comparability of the intervention and 
control groups. Empirical evidence suggests that absence of such characteristics, as reported in 
trial publications, leads to biased estimates of intervention effects. Collections of meta-analyses 
assembled in meta-epidemiological studies are used to study associations of study design 
characteristics with intervention effect estimates, but findings vary between studies.
Objectives
■ To combine data from contributing meta-epidemiological studies into a single database, and 
derive a harmonised data set in which overlap between meta-analyses was removed.
■ To examine agreement in the assessment of reported study design characteristics in the 
subset of trials that was assessed in two or more contributing meta-epidemiological studies.
■ To examine the influence of inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) random 
sequence generation and allocation concealment, and absent or unclear double 
blinding (compared with double blinding), on intervention effect estimates and 
between-trial heterogeneity.
■ To examine whether or not these influences vary with the type of clinical area, intervention, 
comparison and outcome measure.
■ To examine the effects of combinations of characteristics, and to estimate adjusted effects 
using multivariable models.
■ To explore the implications of these findings for downweighting of trials whose 
characteristics are associated with bias in future meta-analyses.
Methods
We combined data from 10 contributing meta-epidemiological studies into a single database 
containing 427 reviews, 454 meta-analyses and 4874 trial results, whose design allowed trials 
to be contained in different meta-analyses, multiple meta-analyses in systematic reviews, 
overlapping meta-analyses between systematic reviews and multiple references to the same 
trial or review. Unique identifiers were used to identify sets of meta-analyses with overlapping 
trials: 258 meta-analyses were unique, whereas for 196 at least one trial overlapped with another 
meta-analysis. Overlapping meta-analyses and trials were removed according to a pre-specified 
protocol. The final database contained 363 meta-analyses and 3477 unique trial results. 
Overlapping trials were used to estimate kappa statistics for agreement between assessments of 
reported study design characteristics.
Information on outcome measures, interventions and comparisons was extracted from the 
included systematic reviews. Interventions were classified as pharmacological; surgical; 
psychosocial and behavioural; and all other interventions. Comparison interventions were 
classified as inactive (placebo, no intervention, standard care) or active. Outcome measures were 
grouped as all-cause mortality; other objectively assessed; and subjectively assessed.

xii Executive summary
The main analyses excluded 87 meta-analyses (1093 trials) from four contributing studies that 
did not collect data on both study design characteristics and outcome events; 36 meta-analyses 
(300 trials) in which it was not possible to classify one intervention as experimental and the 
other as control; one meta-analysis (four trials) that had a continuous outcome measure; 45 
trials with missing outcome data; and 50 trials in which either no or all subjects experienced the 
outcome event.
Statistical methods
Intervention effects were modelled as log-odds ratios; odds ratios <1 corresponded to beneficial 
intervention effects. We fitted Bayesian hierarchical bias models that allowed for random 
intervention effects within meta-analyses, with meta-analysis-specific mean µ and between-trial 
variance τ2
. Three effects of study design characteristics were modelled. First, mean intervention 
effects among trials reported as having a particular study design characteristic may differ from 
those among trials without that characteristic: estimated mean differences were exponentiated 
and reported as ratios of odds ratios (RORs). Second, variation in bias between trials within 
meta-analyses was quantified by standard deviation κ; κ2
 corresponds to the average increase 
in between-trial heterogeneity in trials with a specified study design characteristic. Third, 
variation in mean bias between meta-analyses was quantified by between-meta-analysis standard 
deviation φ. We derived 95% credible intervals (CrIs) for each parameter. Bias models were 
fitted using WinBUGS Version 1.4 (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK), using vague prior 
distributions. The prior for variance parameters found to give the best overall performance was a 
modified Inverse Gamma(0.001, 0.001) prior with increased weight on small values. For location 
parameters (overall mean bias, baseline response rates, treatment effects), Normal(0, 1000) priors 
were assumed.
We first conducted univariable analyses for each bias domain separately using all informative 
meta-analyses (meta-analyses containing trials with and without the characteristic of interest) 
for each characteristic. The primary analysis used dichotomised variables for each characteristic 
(inadequate or unclear compared with adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment, 
and not double blind or unclearly blinded compared with double bind). Analyses were stratified 
according to type of outcome measure (all-cause mortality, other objectively assessed and 
subjectively assessed). Further univariable analyses (examining the influence of combinations 
of design characteristics) and multivariable analyses were conducted using two data subsets: 
trials with information on all three characteristics and trials with information on both allocation 
concealment and blinding.
Results
There was good agreement between assessments of reported study design characteristics carried 
out in the different studies. For sequence generation (two comparisons), the percentages of 
studies in which the assessments were in agreement were 81% and 82% and kappa statistics 
were 0.56 and 0.64. For allocation concealment (12 comparisons), percentage agreement varied 
between 52% and 100% and kappa statistics between 0.19 and 1.00 (median 0.58). Assessments 
were most reliable for blinding (nine comparisons): percentage agreement ranged from 80% to 
100% (in four comparisons), whereas kappa statistics ranged from 0.55 to 1.00 (median 0.87).
Influence of reported study design characteristics: univariable analyses of 
individual characteristics
The main analyses were based on a data set containing 1973 trials included in 234 meta-analyses. 
Based on 944 trials from 112 informative meta-analyses, intervention effect estimates were 
exaggerated by an average of 11% in trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation

(ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.82 to 0.96), and between-trial heterogeneity was higher among such trials 
(κ=0.16, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.27). When analyses were stratified according to type of outcome 
measure, the average effect of bias associated with inadequate or unclear sequence generation was 
greatest for subjective outcomes (ROR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.74 to 0.94) and the increase in between￾trial heterogeneity was also greatest for such outcomes (κ=0.20, CrI 0.03 to 0.32). There was little 
evidence that inadequate or unclear sequence generation was associated with exaggeration of 
intervention effects for all-cause mortality (ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.05) or for other objective 
outcomes (ROR 0.99, 95% CrI 0.84 to 1.16). For all types of outcome, there was only limited 
between-meta-analysis heterogeneity in mean bias (estimated φ between 0.04 and 0.07).
Based on 1292 trials from 146 informative meta-analyses, intervention effect estimates were 
exaggerated by 7% in trials with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment (ROR 0.93, 95% 
CrI 0.87 to 0.99), and between-trial heterogeneity was increased for such studies (κ=0.12, 95% 
CrI 0.02 to 0.23). The effect of inadequate or unclear allocation concealment was greatest among 
meta-analyses with a subjectively assessed outcome measure (ROR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.75 to 0.95; 
κ=0.20, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.33). In contrast, the average effect of inadequate or unclear allocation 
concealment was close to the null for meta-analyses with a mortality outcome (ROR 0.98, 95% 
CrI 0.88 to 1.10) and other objective outcomes (ROR 0.97, 95% CrI 0.85 to 1.10). Estimates 
of both between-trial and between-meta-analyses heterogeneity in bias were lower for such 
outcomes than for subjectively assessed outcomes.
Based on 1057 trials from 104 informative meta-analyses, lack of, or unclear, double blinding 
was associated with an average 13% exaggeration of intervention effects (ROR 0.87, 95% CrI 0.79 
to 0.96). Between-trial heterogeneity was higher in such studies (κ=0.14, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.30), 
and average bias varied between meta-analyses (φ=0.14, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.28). Average bias 
(ROR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.65 to 0.92), between-trial heterogeneity (κ=0.37, 95% CrI 0.19 to 0.53) 
and between-meta-analysis heterogeneity in average bias (φ=0.23, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.44) were all 
greatest for meta-analyses assessing subjective outcome measures. Among meta-analyses with 
subjectively assessed outcome measures, the effect of lack of blinding appeared greater than the 
effect of inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment.
Influence of reported study design characteristics: univariable analyses of 
combinations of characteristics
Estimates of the influence of any risk of selection bias (inadequate or unclear sequence generation 
or allocation concealment, compared with other trials) on intervention effects and heterogeneity 
were based on 53 informative meta-analyses containing 534 trials, of which 89 (17%) were 
assessed as at low risk. Risk of selection bias was associated with an average 11% exaggeration 
of intervention effect estimates (ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.78 to 1.00) and with increased between￾trial heterogeneity (κ=0.12, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.27). Average effects did not differ substantially 
according to type of outcome measure.
Only 37 informative meta-analyses [409 trials, of which 58 (14%) were assessed as being at 
low risk of bias] contributed to the analysis of any risk of bias (inadequate or unclear sequence 
generation or allocation concealment, or lack of or unclear double blinding, compared with all 
other trials). Any risk of bias was associated with an average 21% exaggeration of intervention 
effect estimates (ROR 0.79, 95% CrI 0.64 to 0.92). The numbers of informative meta-analyses and 
trials included in analyses stratified by type of outcome measure were small, but the influence of 
any risk of bias appeared the smallest for all-cause mortality outcomes.
A total of 104 informative meta-analyses [990 trials, of which 259 (26%) were assessed as at 
low risk of bias] contributed to analyses of the influence of inadequate or unclear allocation 
concealment or lack of double blinding (compared with adequate allocation concealment and 

xiv Executive summary
presence of double blinding). Intervention effects from trials at high risk of bias according to this 
definition were exaggerated by an average 12% (ROR 0.88, 95% CrI 0.81 to 0.95). The ROR was 
smaller for all-cause mortality outcomes than for other objective or subjective outcome measures. 
The increase in between-trial heterogeneity appeared greatest for subjective outcome measures 
(κ=0.17, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.31).
Influence of reported study design characteristics: multivariable analyses
Multivariable analyses of the influence of inadequate or unclear allocation concealment and lack 
of or unclear double blinding were based on 169 informative meta-analyses (1456 trials) in which 
both characteristics were assessed. Estimated RORs were similar to, or modestly attenuated 
compared with, those in the univariable analyses. Estimated influence on heterogeneity was also 
modestly attenuated.
Estimated RORs from multivariable analyses of the effects of all three characteristics were of 
similar magnitudes to those in the univariable analyses for each characteristic. For inadequate 
or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment, estimated increases in between-trial 
heterogeneity (quantified by κ) were smaller in multivariable analyses than in the corresponding 
univariable analyses. Estimates of between-meta-analysis variability in average bias were changed 
little compared with univariable analyses.
Analyses according to type of intervention and clinical area
For pregnancy and childbirth – the clinical area contributing most meta-analyses to the 
combined data set – RORs were further from 1 than in the analyses of the whole data set, 
whereas estimates of the influence of reported study design characteristics on heterogeneity were 
broadly consistent with analyses of the whole data set. For mental health and circulatory system 
conditions, RORs were attenuated towards 1. Only small numbers of meta-analyses contributed 
to estimation of κ, but estimated values of κ and φ were generally smaller for circulatory system 
meta-analyses than for the other two clinical areas.
The majority of meta-analyses included in the full data set addressed pharmacological 
interventions; it was therefore unsurprising that overall results restricted to such interventions 
were consistent with those from the full data set. For surgical interventions, effects of inadequate 
or unclear sequence generation and inadequate or unclear allocation concealment were estimated 
from only six and nine meta-analyses respectively; confidence intervals were too wide to allow 
substantive conclusions to be drawn.
Downweighting potentially biased evidence in future meta-analyses
We investigated the implications of our results for downweighting of potentially biased evidence 
in future meta-analyses. Because estimated values of κ and φ were greatest for meta-analyses 
with subjectively assessed outcomes, the minimum variance of the estimated intervention effect 
for a trial at high or unclear risk of bias is greatest for such trials. Across all Bias in Randomised 
and Observational studies (BRANDO) trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation, 
bias adjustment led to a median 10% [interquartile range (IQR) 4% to 23%] increase in trial-level 
variance. Downweighting based on results specific to type of outcome measure has the greatest 
effect in trials with subjectively assessed outcomes [median 20% (IQR 8% to 39%) increase 
in variance]. Results were broadly similar for downweighting based on inadequate or unclear 
allocation concealment. The median increase in variance for trials with subjectively measured 
outcomes that were not double blind or had unclear blinding status was 63% (IQR 22% to 138%).
Downweighting of all trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation led to a median 13% 
(IQR 5% to 32%) increase in the variance of the summary (meta-analytic) intervention effect 
estimate among informative meta-analyses in the BRANDO database. This is in contrast to a

median increase of 217% (IQR 87% to 482%) when such trials are excluded from meta-analyses, 
because only 26% of trials were assessed to have adequate sequence generation. Bias adjustment 
for meta-analyses with subjectively assessed outcome measures led to a median 31% (IQR 11% to 
56%) increase in the variance of the summary intervention effect estimate, which was again small 
compared with complete exclusion of such trials. Results were broadly similar for the other study 
design characteristics, although differences between the effects of downweighting and excluding 
trials at high or unclear risk of bias were smaller for double blinding, because 56% of trials from 
informative meta-analyses were double blind.
Conclusions
Bias associated with specific reported study design characteristics of RCTs leads to exaggeration 
of intervention effect estimates and increases in between-trial heterogeneity. For each of the 
three characteristics assessed, these effects appeared greatest for subjectively assessed outcome 
measures. Assessments of the risk of bias in trial results should account for these findings. 
Downweighting trials at high risk of bias in future meta-analyses, based on these empirical 
findings, could be an alternative to completely excluding such trials from meta-analyses, 
resulting in a smaller loss of precision. The strategies used to combine data from several 
independent data sources and to remove overlap between meta-analyses may be of use for future 
empirical research.
Recommendations for future research
■ Tools for assessing risk of bias in results of RCTs should account for the findings of this study.
■ Practical and acceptable methods for correcting and downweighting the results of trials at 
high risk of bias in new meta-analyses should be developed.
■ The influence of further study design characteristics should be explored in new 
meta-epidemiological studies.
■ As far as possible, clinical decisions should not be based on trials in which blinding is not 
feasible and outcome measures are subjectively assessed.

Chapter 1 
Introduction
Although meta-analyses of randomised trials offer the best evidence for the evaluation of 
clinical interventions, they are not immune from bias.1
 Bias may arise because of selective 
reporting of whole trials or of outcomes within trials,2–5 or because of study design characteristics 
that compromise internal validity.6
 The design of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should 
incorporate characteristics that avoid biases resulting from lack of comparability of the 
intervention and control groups. For example, concealment of randomised allocation avoids 
selection bias (differences in the probability of recruitment to the intervention and control groups 
based on participant characteristics at the time of recruitment), blinding of participants and 
trial personnel avoids performance bias (differences in aspects of patient management between 
intervention groups) and blinding of outcome assessors avoids detection bias (differences in 
outcome measurement).
Empirical evidence about the magnitude and relative importance of the influence of reported 
study design characteristics on trial results comes from ‘meta-epidemiological’ studies in which 
collections of meta-analyses are used to study associations between trial characteristics and 
intervention effect estimates.7,8 There is evidence from such studies that inadequate allocation 
concealment and lack of blinding lead, on average, to exaggeration of intervention effect 
estimates.9–11 However, the evidence is not consistent: some studies did not find evidence 
of effects of these characteristics,12–14 whereas others suggested that other study design 
characteristics were of importance.9–11,15 Possible reasons for this lack of consistency include 
differential effects of study design characteristics across different clinical interventions or between 
different objectively and subjectively assessed outcome measures,16 differences in definitions 
of characteristics and methods of assessment (some studies relied on assessments reported in 
contributing systematic reviews9
), and chance.8
 The extent of overlap between meta-analyses 
contributing to the different studies is unclear.
As the effects of study design characteristics tend to be estimated imprecisely within individual 
meta-analyses,8
 large collections of meta-analyses are needed to estimate effects of these 
characteristics with precision, and to examine variability in these effects according to clinical area 
or type of outcome measure. It is, therefore, desirable to combine the collections of meta-analyses 
that were assembled in previous studies so that unified analyses can be conducted. However, 
these studies assembled their collections of meta-analyses independently, and so the extent 
of overlap between the meta-analyses and trials included in the different studies is unknown. 
Identification and resolution of such overlaps is difficult because of the multiplicities inherent 
in the data structure: trials report results on multiple outcomes and may be included in multiple 
meta-analyses, while systematic reviews may contain many different meta-analyses. Data are 
extracted from multiple publications that may describe trials, systematic reviews or both.
By combining data from 10 meta-epidemiological studies into a single database we identified 
and removed overlaps between trials and meta-analyses, and investigated the consistency of 
assessments of reported study design characteristics between the different contributing studies.17
Based on seven contributing studies in which both study design characteristics and results were 
recorded, we investigated the influence of different study design characteristics on both average 
intervention effects and between-trial heterogeneity, according to type of intervention and type of 
outcome measure.

Development of a combined database for 
meta-epidemiological research
Methods
Data
Data were combined as part of the BRANDO (Bias in Randomized and Observational studies) 
project. The authors of 10 meta-epidemiological studies9,11–15,18–21 (Table 1) agreed to contribute 
their original data to a combined database that would be used to conduct combined analyses 
and investigate reasons for differences between the results of the original studies. The combined 
database was created using Microsoft AccessTM software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, 
WA, USA). Most authors supplied separate tables containing data on included trials and meta￾analyses, allowing linkage between these two levels of data. When such information was not 
supplied, information from publications of relevant systematic reviews was used to link trials and 
meta-analyses.15 Citations (of publications from which the data were extracted) were linked to 
the data sets using matching via source systematic review, author name and publication year.12–15

 that 
was based on published journal articles [referred to hereafter as Egger (journal)] did not include 
information on study design characteristics in the included trials, whereas the study by Royle and 
Milne19 did not include outcome data. These studies cannot contribute to meta-epidemiological 
analyses, but were retained to contribute to other, descriptive analyses.

4 Development of a combined database for meta-epidemiological research
Assigning identification numbers and creating a unified data set
To enable automated identification of meta-analyses and trials that occurred in more than one 
meta-epidemiological study, we labelled each trial and review entry in contributing data sets with 
a MEDLINE, EMBASE or ISI Web of Science unique publication identifier (ID), in respective 
order of preference. We first searched MEDLINE (through PubMedTM) using bibliographic 
information for every trial and review included in contributing data sets [e.g. full title, author(s), 
publication year, journal, volume, pagination] and retrieved their unique MEDLINE identifier 
(PMID). For references that were not located in MEDLINE, EMBASE was searched (through 
OvidTM) in the same way and EMBASE-unique identifiers were retrieved. For references that 
were not located in EMBASE the search was carried out in the ISI Web of Science database, but 
only a small number of the remaining non-indexed citations were identified in this way. Trial 
references not indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE or ISI were cross-checked for duplication with 
other references using duplicate search facilities in Reference ManagerTM bibliographic database 
software (Thompson Reuters, New York, NY, USA), followed by manual checking. All non￾indexed, unique references were assigned a unique identification number derived from their ID 
number in the Reference Manager database.
We defined in the master database the variables that we wished to combine from the contributing 
studies. An initial combined data set was then created by mapping each variable in each 
contributed data set to the predefined variable in the master database that it most closely 
matched. New variables were then added to the master database to capture contributed data that 
did not fit the a priori variable definitions.
Identification and removal of duplicate meta-analyses and trials
The unique identifiers of trials included in each meta-analysis in the combined data set were 
compared with those in every other meta-analysis (regardless of whether or not the meta￾analyses assessed the same outcome). Using Intercooled StataTM version 9 (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, TX, USA), meta-analyses that contained any trials in common with any other meta￾analysis were grouped together. Not all meta-analyses within these sets contained overlapping 
trials: for example, two meta-analyses with no trials in common might each contain trials in 
common with a third meta-analysis and these three meta-analyses formed one set.
Meta-analyses that had no overlap with any other meta-analysis in the combined data set were 
transferred to the final data set. We then considered each set of overlapping meta-analyses in 
turn. Meta-analyses were excluded from each set until there was minimal overlap between the 
remaining meta-analyses, according to the following rules:
1. Exclude meta-analyses from the Royle and Milne19 study, which did not include outcome 
data (entire meta-analysis removed regardless of the extent of overlap).
2. Exclude meta-analyses for which information on study design characteristics was not 
available in preference to those for which such information was available. If both meta￾analyses in a duplicate pair contain no information on study design characteristics, exclude 
meta-analyses from earlier studies first: in order Egger (journal),9
 Sampson et al.,
20 McAuley 
et al.18 (entire meta-analysis removed regardless of the extent of overlap).
3. Exclude meta-analyses from the portion of the study by Egger et al.
9
 that was based on 
assessment of study design characteristics in Cochrane reviews in preference to meta￾analyses from studies that directly assessed these characteristics.
4. Exclude meta-analyses with fewer assessed study design characteristics in preference to those 
with more assessed characteristics.
5. Exclude meta-analyses from less recently published systematic reviews in preference to more 
recently published reviews.
6. Exclude meta-analyses including fewer trials in preference to meta-analyses including 
more trials.

These rules were used in order of priority, that is, the next rule was applied only if the previous 
could not yield a decision. We recorded reasons for all decisions to exclude meta-analyses. Pairs 
of meta-analyses with recorded study design characteristics and results that had only a minimal 
overlap between them were retained at this stage. Overlap was considered minimal if the number 
of overlapping trials was no more than 10% of the sum of the numbers of overlapping trials and 
unique trials from both meta-analyses. We then removed the overlapping trials from the meta￾analysis in the duplicate pair that (1) contained more trials or (2) according to the rules 3 to 5 
above. If these rules did not yield a clear decision, overlapping trials were removed from one of 
the meta-analyses at random. At both stages, the choice of meta-analyses or trials to be removed 
was independent of the assessment of the study design characteristics, and disagreements in these 
assessments between studies were not considered. Similarly, the decision on removal was also 
independent of the types of outcome measure assessed in the overlapping meta-analyses.
Some meta-analyses contained multiple results from the same trial, usually because they included 
multiarm trials in which the same control/comparison group was compared with two different 
treatment groups. Where appropriate, the two treatment groups were combined. In other cases 
one of the results was removed at random. We then checked the 2×2 results tables from trials 
in the deduplicated data set against the data in the source review publications. Inconsistencies 
were clarified with the contributors and corrected where necessary. We recoded the direction of 
outcome events where necessary so that the coded outcome for each trial corresponded to an 
adverse (undesirable) event.
Assessing consistency of assessment of reported study design characteristics in 
different contributing studies
We used trials included in more than one meta-epidemiological study to assess the reliability 
of the assessment of methodological characteristics between studies. For this analysis we 
defined such trials as those with the same bibliographic reference occurring in more than one 
meta-epidemiological study, irrespective of numbers of participants or events, or the type of 
outcome measure. To assess the inter-rater reliability we compared contributors’ assessments of 
the following three methodological characteristics: adequacy of the method for generating the 
random sequence used for allocating participants to treatment groups (sequence generation), 
adequacy of concealment of treatment allocation from participants and investigators at the point 
of enrolment into the trial (allocation concealment), and contributors’ assessments of whether or 
not a trial was double blind or not (blinding). Kappa statistics were calculated for the assessment 
of sequence generation (inadequate/unclear compared with adequate), allocation concealment 
(inadequate/unclear compared with adequate) and blinding (not double blind/unclear compared 
with double blind) of duplicated trials for each pair-wise comparison between contributing 
meta-epidemiological studies. Only comparisons with at least 10 overlapping trials between any 
two meta-epidemiological studies were analysed, for each of the three characteristics.
Classification of interventions and outcome measures
We classified the type of experimental intervention, type of comparison intervention and type 
of outcome measure for each meta-analysis in the final data set. Interventions were classified 
based on an expanded and modified version of the classification by Moja et al.
23 Comparison 
interventions were further classified as inactive (e.g. placebo, standard care) or active. When 
it was not clear which intervention group should be considered experimental and which the 
comparison, at least two study collaborators made a consensus decision. In cases when a decision 
could not be reached, such meta-analyses were excluded from analyses of associations between 
study design characteristics and intervention effect estimates.
We classified outcome measures according to an expanded and modified version of the 
classification developed by Wood et al.
16 Outcome measures were further grouped as all-cause 
mortality, other objectively assessed (including pregnancy outcomes and laboratory outcomes), 

6 Development of a combined database for meta-epidemiological research
objectively measured but potentially influenced by clinician/patient judgement (e.g. hospital 
admissions, total dropouts/withdrawals, caesarean section, operative/assisted delivery) and 
subjectively assessed. When a review reported that different methods of outcome assessment were 
used in different trials within the same meta-analysis, the meta-analysis was classified according 
to the most subjective method of outcome assessment. This was the case in 16 meta-analyses. 
For example, some trials of smoking cessation assessed outcomes using exhaled carbon dioxide 
or salivary cotinine (classified as objectively assessed), whereas for others it was by patient 
self-report (classified as subjectively assessed). Classifications of interventions and outcome 
measures were checked by at least two of the collaborators who were clinicians by training (CG, 
LLG, BA-N or JP). Classifications of both outcome measures and interventions were based 
solely on the information provided in the review from which the meta-analysis was extracted. 
We did not retrieve further information on individual outcome measures from publications of 
included trials.

meta-analyses, multiple meta-analyses in systematic reviews, overlapping meta-analyses between

tables. Each reference entry was linked to its related trial or systematic review, and further 
links were established between trials, trial results, meta-analyses and systematic reviews in the 
corresponding database tables. Figure 1 lists core variables included in each table.
Removing overlaps
Figure 2 depicts the derivation of the final database through removal of overlaps between 
meta-analyses. The initial combined data set contained 427 systematic reviews with 454 meta￾analyses, 4857 trials and 4874 trial results. Of the 454 meta-analyses, 196 contained at least one 
trial that overlapped with at least one other meta-analysis, among which we identified 71 sets 
of meta-analyses containing overlapping trials. The size of these sets varied from 2 to 17 meta￾analyses (median 2). We removed 91 entire meta-analyses containing 1354 trial results during 
the deduplication process. Of the 1354 results removed, 844 were duplicates of trials retained 
in the database, whereas 510 were unique. Of those that were unique, 340 (67%) were from 
studies that did not record either methodological characteristics or results, thus 170 potentially 
informative trials were removed during this process. A further 24 individual trial results were 
removed from 16 additional meta-analyses for which overlap was minimal (see methods). One 
trial was removed from 10 meta-analyses, two trials from four meta-analyses, and three trials 
from two meta-analyses each. An additional 19 trial results were removed as a result of overlaps 
within nine of the meta-analyses (e.g. where there were two comparisons with a common control 
group). The final database contained 352 systematic reviews contributing 363 meta-analyses, 
3474 trials and 3477 trial results.

Unique trials, number of unique (non-overlapping) trials in meta-analysis. Exact, number of trials for which all 2×2 data were the same in the 
overlapping meta-analyses. Same totals, number of trials in which the event data differ, but there was the same total number of participants in 
the intervention and comparison groups. Different, number of trials in which both group total and event data are different in the overlapping meta￾analyses. Within, number of trials that are duplicated within the individual meta-analysis (usually this was in case of multiarm trials entered as 
multiple comparisons).
Table 2 shows an example of a set of four meta-analyses containing overlapping trials. Three 
meta-analyses (1005, 2456 and 2531) were taken from the same Cochrane review,24 whereas 
2097 was from a journal review25 with a similar topic. Table 3 summarises the overlap between 
the trials in each pair of meta-analyses. To remove overlaps, meta-analyses were dropped in the 
following order: (1) meta-analysis 2097, because it was contributed by the Egger (journal) study,9
which did not include study design characteristics; (2) meta-analysis 2456, because study design 
characteristics in this study were extracted from a Cochrane review rather than from primary 
publications. The overlap between the remaining two meta-analyses (1005, from the study by 
Contopoulos-Ioannidis et al.21 and 2531 from the study by Kjaergard et al.15) was then examined 
in detail (Table 4). Each meta-analysis contained 10 trials, of which eight overlapped. Of the 
overlapping trials, seven had the same totals per group (different event numbers), and one trial 
had different data for the control group. These meta-analyses assessed two different outcomes:

exact correspondence in the 2×2 data for any trial. Meta-analysis 1005 was retained because 
the contributing study provided information on one additional study design characteristic

Reliability of assessment of reported study design characteristics
Eight of the participating meta-epidemiological studies contained sufficient trials (at least 10) 
in common to contribute to analyses of the reliability of assessment of reported study design 
characteristics (Table 5). Overall, there was good agreement between assessments carried out in 
the different contributing studies. For sequence generation (two comparisons), the percentages 
of studies in which the assessments were in agreement were 81% and 82% and kappa statistics 
were 0.56 and 0.64. For allocation concealment (12 comparisons), percentage agreement varied 
between 52% and 100% and kappa statistics between 0.19 and 1.00 (median 0.58). The lowest 
kappa (0.19) was observed in the comparison between the Egger et al.9
 and Pildal et al.14 studies: 
10 (48%) studies assessed as having adequate concealment of allocation in the Egger study (which 
used assessments reported by Cochrane review authors) were assessed as having inadequate or 
unclear concealment of allocation in the Pildal study. Assessments were most reliable for blinding 
(nine comparisons): percentage agreement ranged from 80% to 100% (in four comparisons), and 
kappa statistics ranged from 0.55 to 1.00 (median 0.87).
Interventions and outcome measures
Outcome measures were initially classified into one of 23 categories. Table 6 shows the numbers 
of meta-analyses with outcomes in each of these categories, together with the final category 
grouping. The most common outcome measure was all-cause mortality (64 meta-analyses, 18%), 
followed by clinician-assessed outcomes (51 meta-analyses, 14%).

intervention were excluded from meta-epidemiological analyses.
Description of the final database
The final data set contained information from 363 meta-analyses containing 3474 trials. Of 
these, 282 meta-analyses (2572 trials) had 2×2 results data available. A total of 186 meta￾analyses (1236 trials) had information on randomisation sequence generation, 228 (1840) on 
allocation concealment and 234 (1970) on blinding. In total, 175 meta-analyses (1171 trials) had 
information on 2×2 results data and these three study design characteristics.

Chapter 3
Influence of reported study design 
characteristics on average intervention 
effects and between-trial heterogeneity
Introduction
In this chapter we report the results of analyses of the influence of three reported study design 
characteristics [inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) random sequence generation; 
inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) allocation concealment; and absent or 
unclear double blinding (compared with double blinding)] on both average intervention 
effects and between-trial heterogeneity, according to the type of intervention and type of 
outcome. We examine whether or not these influences vary with the type of clinical area, 
intervention, comparison and outcome measure, examine effects of combinations of study design 
characteristics, estimate-adjusted effects using multivariable models, compare results with those 
derived using previously used (meta-meta-analytic) methods and explore implications of these 
findings for downweighting of trials whose study design characteristics are associated with bias in 
future meta-analyses.
Methods
For this part of the study we removed, from the database described in Chapter 2, data from three 
meta-epidemiological studies18–20 and one part of the Egger et al. study9
 that did not collect data 
on study design characteristics (87 meta-analyses with 1093 trials). We also removed 36 meta￾analyses (300 trials) in which it was not possible to classify one intervention as experimental and 
the other as control, one meta-analysis (four trials) that had a continuous outcome, 45 trials in 
which outcome data were missing and 50 trials in which either no or all participants experienced 
the outcome event.
Categories of intervention (see Table 7) containing fewer than 10 meta-analyses or 50 trials 
were combined into four types of intervention: pharmacological, surgical, psychosocial and 
behavioural, and all other interventions. Comparison interventions were classified as inactive 
(e.g. placebo, no intervention, standard care) or active. Outcome measures were grouped as 
all-cause mortality, other objectively assessed (including pregnancy outcomes and laboratory 
outcomes), objectively measured but potentially influenced by clinician/patient judgement (e.g. 
hospital admissions, total dropouts/withdrawals, caesarean section, operative/assisted delivery) 
and subjectively assessed (e.g. clinician-assessed outcomes, symptoms and symptom scores, 
pain, metal health outcomes, cause-specific mortality). Too few meta-analyses were categorised 
as having ‘other objectively assessed’ and ‘objectively measured but potentially influenced by 
clinician/patient judgement’ outcome measures to allow separate analyses; these categories were 
therefore grouped together.

14 Influence of reported study design characteristics on average intervention effects and between-trial heterogeneity
Statistical methods
Intervention effects were modelled as log-odds ratios and outcomes were recoded where 
necessary so that odds ratios (ORs) <1 corresponded to beneficial intervention effects. We fitted 
Bayesian hierarchical bias models using the formulation previously described as ‘Model 3’ by 
Welton et al.
26 We assumed that the observed number of events in each arm of each trial has a 
binomial distribution, with the underlying log-odds ratio in trial i in meta-analysis m (LORim) 
equal to
LORim =δ im + βimXim [Equation 1]
where Xim =1 and 0 for trials with and without the reported characteristic. The parameter δim
represents the intervention effect in trial i of meta-analysis m. These are assumed to be randomly 
distributed with variance τ m
2
 within each meta-analysis:
δ τ im ~ , Normal( ) dm m
2 [Equation 2]
Parameter βim quantifies the potential bias associated with the study design characteristic of 
interest. We assumed the following model structure:
β κ ~ , Normal( ) b im m
2 [Equation 3]
for trials i with the reported characteristic in each meta-analysis m, and
b N m ~ , ormal b( ) 0 ϕ2 [Equation 4]
across meta-analyses.
This allows for three effects of bias. First, mean intervention effects may differ between trials 
with and without the reported study design characteristic. Estimated mean differences (b0
) 
were exponentiated and are thus reported as ratios of odds ratios (RORs). Second, variation in 
bias between trials within meta-analyses is quantified by standard deviation κ; κ2
 corresponds 
to the average increase in between-trial heterogeneity in trials with a specified study design 
characteristic. Third, variation in mean bias between meta-analyses is quantified by between￾meta-analysis standard deviation φ. We derived 95% credible intervals (CrI) for each parameter. 
In presenting results from our primary analyses, we also display the posterior variance of the 
parameter b0
, denoted by V0
. Use of this value in downweighting results from trials at high risk 
of bias in future meta-analyses is discussed below. For the results of our secondary analyses we 
do not present V0
 explicitly, but the posterior uncertainty about b0
 is reflected in the CrI for 
the ROR.
Data management and cleaning prior to analysis, and graphical displays of results, were 
carried out using Stata Version 11. Bias models were then fitted using WinBUGS Version 1.4
(MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK),27 assuming vague prior distributions for unknown 
parameters. Preliminary results indicated that estimated variance components κ and φ were 
sensitive to the prior distributions assumed for these parameters. Sensitivity to priors for variance 
parameters is a well-known problem in Bayesian hierarchical modelling.28,29 This motivated 
a simulation study in which the performance of a range of prior distributions for variance 
components was compared, assuming typical values from the BRANDO database (Harris et al., 
Health Protection Agency, 2010, personal communication). The prior found to give the best 
overall performance was a modified Inverse Gamma(0.001, 0.001) prior with increased weight 
on small values. This prior was therefore assumed for each variance parameter in all analyses.

For location parameters (overall mean bias, baseline response rates, treatment effects), Normal(0, 
1000) priors were assumed.
Meta-analyses can inform estimates of the effect of a study design characteristic only if they 
contain at least one trial with and one without the characteristic. We refer to such meta-analyses 
and trials from these meta-analyses as informative. As it is impossible to estimate both τ2
 and κ
in a meta-analysis with fewer than two studies with and without the study design characteristic of 
interest, such meta-analyses were prevented from contributing to the estimation of κ by use of the 
‘cut’ function in WinBUGS.
We first conducted univariable analyses for each study design characteristic separately using 
all informative meta-analyses for that characteristic. The primary analysis used dichotomised 
variables for each characteristic (inadequate/unclear compared with adequate for sequence 
generation and allocation concealment, and not double blind/unclear compared with double 
bind). All such analyses were repeated separately for different types of outcome measure (all￾cause mortality, other objectively assessed and subjectively assessed). Evidence that effects of 
bias differed according to the type of outcome was quantified using posterior probabilities that 
effects for subjective or other objective outcomes were larger than those for mortality outcomes: 
for example Pr(κsubjective >κmortality). The main univariable analyses were repeated using the meta￾meta-analytic approach used in previous analyses8,16 allowing for random effects both within and 
between meta-analyses.
Further univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted using two data subsets: (1) 
meta-analyses of trials with information on all three study design characteristics and (2) meta￾analyses of trials with information on both allocation concealment and blinding. Subset 2 was 
used because many studies did not have a recorded bias judgement on sequence generation (see 
Table 11). We conducted univariable analyses on three composite dichotomous variables: risk of 
bias due to inadequate/unclear allocation concealment or lack of blinding (using subset 2), any 
risk of selection bias (inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment) and 
any risk of bias (inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment, or not 
double blind). Analyses of the second two composite variables used subset 1.
Multivariable analyses were based on an extension of ‘Model 3’ of Welton et al.
26 We assumed 
distinct variance components associated with each study design characteristic. In the main 
multivariable analyses, we assumed no interactions between the different characteristics. In 
an additional analysis on subset 2 we allowed for interactions between inadequate allocation 
concealment and lack of double blinding. Interaction terms were assumed to have the same 
hierarchical structure as the main effects, again with distinct variance components. The implied 
average bias in studies with both characteristics was estimated (on the log-odds scale) as the sum 
of the fitted coefficients representing the average effect of each of the two characteristics and the 
fitted coefficient representing the average interaction term. A 95% CrI for this sum, accounting 
for correlations between the three coefficients, was calculated using WinBUGS. These measures 
were exponentiated in order to express the implied average bias as ROR. For comparison, we also 
calculated the corresponding implied average bias for the model without interaction terms for 
subset 2. We repeated all univariable analyses on subsets 1 and 2 to allow comparisons with the 
results of multivariable analyses.
In additional analyses we estimated separate effects of ‘inadequate’ and ‘unclear’, for each study 
design characteristic, by fitting models in which these two categories had different average bias 
(compared with ‘adequate’ trials) and distinct variance components (κ and φ). It was necessary 
to exclude some of the contributing meta-epidemiological studies from these analyses because 
their original data coding had not separated unclear from inadequate (see Tables 9 and 11). We 

16 Influence of reported study design characteristics on average intervention effects and between-trial heterogeneity
conducted separate analyses according to clinical area and type of intervention, and repeated 
analyses in meta-analyses that were derived from the subset of contributing studies not included 
in the study of Wood et al.
16 For meta-analyses comparing two active interventions it is not 
possible to estimate RORs quantifying average bias, or between-meta-analysis heterogeneity in 
average bias, because there is no clear direction in which bias operates. Instead, we estimated 
parameters from restricted models to estimate increases in between-trial (within-meta-analysis) 
heterogeneity in trials with, compared with those without, specified study design characteristics, 
among meta-analyses containing at least two trials with and without the characteristic of interest.
Welton et al.26 showed how results from hierarchical bias models can be used to formulate a prior 
distribution for the bias associated with a study design characteristic in a new fixed-effect meta￾analysis that is assumed to be statistically exchangeable with the meta-analyses used to estimate 
the model parameters. This approach was based on a normal approximation to the distribution of 
the observed intervention effect yi
in each new trial i, which is assumed to have known sampling 
variance σi
2
. Assuming known b0, κ, φ and V0
, a posteriori use of the empirically based prior 
distribution leads to results from trials with the reported characteristic being corrected for the 
estimated average bias across meta-analyses (estimated b0
), and the variance of such results being 
increased from σi
2
 to (σi
2+κ2+φ2+V0
). The minimum variance of the estimated intervention 
effect that can in theory be achieved by an infinitely large trial with the reported characteristic is 
therefore κ2+φ2+V0
.
It is of interest to quantify the likely magnitude of increases in variance resulting from application 
of this bias adjustment to future trial results. To do so, for each trial in the BRANDO data set we 
calculated the observed log-odds ratio yi
 and the Woolf estimate of its sampling variance, σi
2
. We 
assumed that these represented a typical range of σi
2
s that may be observed in future trials. For 
each high/unclear-risk trial result in turn, we calculated the percentage increase in variance that 
would result from bias adjustment at the trial level, that is:
σ κ ϕ
σ

2 [Equation 5]
The calculations used the posterior median values of κ and φ. We summarised these percentage 
increases in variance by the median and interquartile range (IQR) across trials for each study 
design characteristic.
Formulae from Welton et al.26 also allow us to calculate a bias-adjusted summary mean and 
variance of the intervention effect in a new fixed-effect meta-analysis. Using this approach, results 
from trials at low risk of bias are assigned the usual inverse variance (1/σi
2
) weight. For trials 
at high/unclear risk of bias, the bias-corrected estimated effect size is used, and downweighted 
according to a function of σi
2

 (interested readers are referred to page 123 of Welton 
et al.26). The resulting bias-adjusted estimate of the summary effect size will therefore have a 
larger variance than the standard unadjusted meta-analytic summary. The magnitude of this 
increase in variance will depend on the number of trials and the variances of the intervention 
effect estimates in the new meta-analysis, and the number of trials classified as high/unclear risk 
of bias. We assumed that the meta-analyses in the BRANDO database are typical in terms of 
these characteristics, and calculated the percentage increase in variance of the summary log￾odds ratio due to bias adjustment for each meta-analysis in turn. These were summarised by the 
median and IQR across meta-analyses for each study design characteristic.

Results
Table 8 shows the included meta-epidemiological studies, the sources of their collections of 
meta-analyses and the study design characteristics that they assessed. For five studies12–15,21 data 
from each trial report were extracted by two researchers independently; in the study by Pildal et 
al.
14 the assessors were also blinded to trial results. In the study by Schulz et al.,11 one researcher, 
who was blinded to the trial outcome, assessed the reported methodological characteristics of 
included trials using a detailed classification scheme. The study of Egger et al.
9
 was based on 
quality assessments by the authors of the included Cochrane reviews, which were generally 
carried out in duplicate by two observers.
Table 9 shows the definitions of adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment and 
blinding used in the seven studies. Definitions of adequate sequence generation and adequate 
allocation concealment were similar in all seven studies and were based on the definitions 
originally proposed by Schulz et al.
11 Sequence generation was assessed as adequate, unclear 
or inadequate in five studies. The study by Kjaergard et al.
15 provided only dichotomised 
assessments of adequate compared with inadequate or unclear sequence generation, and Balk
et al.
13 did not assess adequacy of sequence generation. Allocation concealment was assessed as 
adequate, unclear or inadequate in all seven studies. Definitions of ‘double blind’ varied between 
studies and were somewhat stricter in the studies by Schulz et al.
11 and Pildal et al.
14 Trials were 
categorised as double blind, unclear or not double blind in three studies,9,12,14 with the remaining 
four11,13,15,21 categorising trials as either double blind or unclear/not double blind.
Table 10 shows characteristics of the 234 meta-analyses and 1973 trials included in the database 
analysed. The median year of publication was 2000 for meta-analyses and 1989 for trials, whereas 
the median sample size was 1264 for meta-analyses and 112 for trials. A total of 57 meta￾analyses (24.4%) were concerned with conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth, followed 
by circulatory system conditions (31, 13.3%) and mental health (26, 11.1%). The majority of 
experimental interventions were pharmacological (162 meta-analyses, 69.2%), whereas placebo 
or no treatment was the most common comparison intervention (172, 73.5%). A total of 98 meta￾analyses (41.9%) analysed a subjectively assessed outcome, followed by all-cause mortality (44, 
18.8%), outcomes that are objectively measured, but potentially influenced by patient/clinician 
judgement (42, 18.0%) and other objectively assessed outcomes (36, 15.4%); 14 meta-analyses 
(6.0%) contained trials with both objective and subjective outcome measures (e.g. validated and 
self-reported smoking cessation).
Table 11 summarises the characteristics of trials included in analyses. Information on sequence 
generation was available for 1207 (61.2%) trials included in 186 meta-analyses, of which 112 
meta-analyses containing 944 trials were informative. Sequence generation was assessed as 
unclear in 769 (63.7%) of these trials, although 306 (25.4%) were assessed as having adequate 
sequence generation. Percentages were similar for trials included in informative meta-analyses.
Information on allocation concealment was available for most meta-analyses (228, 97.4%) and 
trials (1796, 91.0%), of which 146 meta-analyses containing 1292 trials were informative. In 
1244 (69.3%) trials, allocation concealment was assessed as unclear; 416 (23.2%) trials reported 
sufficient information to be classed as having adequate allocation concealment. The percentage of 
trials assessed as having adequate allocation concealment was somewhat higher (29.1%) among 
those included in informative meta-analyses.

18 Influence of reported study design characteristics on average intervention effects and between-trial heterogeneity
Information on double blinding was available for all except three trials. However, only 104 meta￾analyses (1057 trials) were informative; 77 meta-analyses contained no trials that were double 
blind, whereas 53 contained only double-blind trials. A total of 929 (47.2%) trials were classified 
as double blind, compared with 590 (55.8%) trials in informative meta-analyses.
Information on both allocation concealment and blinding was available in 1793 (90.9%) 
trials contained in 228 (97.4%) meta-analyses, although information on all three study design 
characteristics was available in 1171 (59.4%) trials contained in 175 (74.8%) meta-analyses.
Table 12 shows associations between the reported study design characteristics, for all trials 
combined and separately according to the nature of the outcome measure. Trials reporting 
adequate sequence generation were more likely to report adequate allocation concealment [OR 
3.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.20 to 4.12], but there was little association between adequate 
sequence generation and double blinding (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35). However, adequately 
concealed trials were more likely to be double blind (OR 3.14, 95% CI 2.49 to 3.96).

22 Influence of reported study design characteristics on average intervention effects and between-trial heterogeneity
Associations between reported study design characteristics were similar for the different types of 
outcome measure. Table 13 shows the number of trials assessed with each of the eight possible 
combinations of the study design characteristics, overall and according to the type of outcome 
measure. Only 60 (5.1%) trials were assessed as at low risk of bias for all three characteristics, 
whereas 453 (38.7%) were assessed as at high risk of bias for all three characteristics.
Influence of reported study design characteristics on intervention effect estimates: 
univariable analyses of individual characteristics
Figure 3 and Table 14 present results from univariable analyses of the influence of reported study 
design characteristics on intervention effect estimates, both overall and separately according to 
type of outcome measure. Compared with Figure 3, Table 14 additionally includes 95% CrIs for 
the variance parameters κ and φ and displays the numbers of trials, and trials at high risk of bias, 
included in analyses. Overall, intervention effect estimates were exaggerated by an average of 
11% in trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation (ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.82 to 0.96), 
and between-trial heterogeneity was higher among such trials (κ=0.16, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.27). 
When analyses were stratified according to the type of outcome measure, the average effect of 
inadequate or unclear sequence generation appeared greatest for subjective outcomes [ROR 0.83, 
95% CrI 0.74 to 0.94, posterior probability (PPr) that RORsubjective<RORmortality=0.73], and the 
increase in between-trial heterogeneity was also greatest for such outcomes (κ=0.20, CrI 0.03 
to 0.32, PPr that κsubjective>κmortality=0.78). In contrast, there was little evidence that inadequate or 
unclear sequence generation was associated with exaggeration of intervention effects for all-cause 
mortality (ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.05) or for other objective outcomes (ROR 0.99, 95% CrI 
0.84 to 1.16). For all types of outcome measure there was only limited between-meta-analysis 
heterogeneity in mean bias (estimated φ between 0.04 and 0.07).
Overall, intervention effect estimates were exaggerated by 7% in trials with inadequate or 
unclear allocation concealment (ROR 0.93, 95% CrI 0.87 to 0.99), and there was evidence that 
between-trial heterogeneity was increased for such studies (κ=0.12, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.23). 
The influence of inadequate or unclear allocation concealment appeared greatest among meta￾analyses with a subjectively assessed outcome measure (ROR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.75 to 0.95, PPr that 
RORsubjective<RORmortality=0.97; κ=0.20, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.33, PPr that κsubjective>κmortality=0.85). In 
contrast, the average effect of inadequate or unclear allocation concealment was close to the null 
for meta-analyses with mortality (ROR 0.98, 95% CrI 0.88 to 1.10) and other objective outcomes

(ROR 0.97, 95% CrI, 0.85 to 1.10). Estimates of both between-trial and between-meta-analyses 
heterogeneity in bias were lower for such outcomes than for subjectively assessed outcomes.
Lack of, or unclear, double blinding was associated with an average 13% exaggeration of 
intervention effects (ROR 0.87, 95% CrI 0.79 to 0.96). There was evidence that between-trial 
heterogeneity was increased for such studies (κ=0.14, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.30), and that average 
bias varied between meta-analyses (φ=0.14, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.28). Average bias (ROR 0.78, 
95% CrI 0.65 to 0.92), increased between-trial heterogeneity (κ=0.37, 95% CrI 0.19 to 0.53) and 
between-meta-analysis heterogeneity in average bias (φ=0.23, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.44) all appeared 
greatest for meta-analyses assessing subjective outcomes (PPr RORsubjective<RORmortality=0.94, 
PPr κsubjective>κmortality=0.99, PPr φsubjective>φmortality=0.90). Among meta-analyses with subjectively 
assessed outcomes, the influence of lack of blinding appeared greater than the influence of 
inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment.
Results from univariable analyses of the influence of inadequate or unclear allocation

175 meta-analyses (1171 trials) that had information on all three study design characteristics 
(sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding). The results were similar (Table 16), 
although the influence of inadequate allocation concealment appeared somewhat greater in 
analyses restricted to the 88 informative meta-analyses (811 trials) that had information on all 
three characteristics.
Influence of reported study design characteristics: univariable analyses of 
combinations of characteristics
We conducted further univariable analyses using variables defined based on combinations of 
the study design characteristics. Figure 4 and Table 16 show the estimated effects of any risk of 
selection bias (inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment, compared 
with other trials) on intervention effects and heterogeneity, based on 53 informative meta￾analyses containing 534 trials, of which 89 (17%) were assessed as being at low risk of selection 
bias. Risk of selection bias was associated with an average 11% exaggeration of intervention 
effect estimates (ROR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.78 to 1.00) and with increased between-trial heterogeneity 
(κ=0.12, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.27). Average effects did not differ substantially according to type 
of outcome measure. Between-meta-analysis heterogeneity was highest for objective outcomes 
(φ=0.20, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.68).
Only 37 informative meta-analyses [409 trials, of which 58 (14%) were assessed as being at 
low risk of bias] contributed to the analysis of any risk of bias (inadequate or unclear sequence 
generation or allocation concealment, or lack of or unclear double blinding, compared with all 
other trials); Figure 4 and Table 16 show estimated effects of any risk of bias from one of the three 
characteristics (compared with low risk of bias from all three). Any risk of bias was associated 
with an average 21% exaggeration of intervention effect estimates (ROR 0.79, 95% CrI 0.64 to 
0.92). The numbers of informative meta-analyses and trials included in analyses stratified by 
type of outcome measure were small, but the influence of any risk of bias appeared smallest for 
all-cause mortality outcomes.
A total of 104 informative meta-analyses [990 trials, of which 259 (26%) were assessed as at 
low risk of bias] contributed to analyses of the influence of inadequate or unclear allocation 
concealment or lack of double blinding (compared with adequate allocation concealment and 
presence of double blinding). Figure 4 and Table 15 show that intervention effects from trials at 
high risk of bias according to this variable were exaggerated by an average of 12% (ROR 0.88, 
95% CrI 0.81 to 0.95). The ROR was closer to 1 (0.95) for all-cause mortality outcomes than for 
other objective or subjective outcomes (0.84, 95% CrI 0.69 to 1.00 and 0.83, 95% CrI 0.73 to 
0.93 respectively). The increase in between-trial heterogeneity appeared greatest for subjective 
outcomes (κ=0.17, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.31).
Univariable analyses: comparison with meta-meta-analytic approach
Table 17 displays results of univariable analyses, based on all available data, conducted using the 
meta-meta-analytic approach8
 employed in previous work.16 Using this approach, we estimated 
the ROR and the between-meta-analysis standard deviation φ associated with each study design 
characteristic. Increases in between-trial variability are not estimated using this approach.
For inadequate or unclear sequence generation, inadequate or unclear allocation concealment 
and lack of or unclear double blinding, estimated RORs are broadly consistent with those 
from the hierarchical bias models displayed in Figure 3. For each study design characteristic, 
the exaggeration of intervention effect estimates is greater for meta-analyses with subjectively 
assessed outcomes than for meta-analyses with all-cause mortality or other objectively assessed 
outcomes. Consistent with the small estimated values of φ in the hierarchical models, the 
between-meta-analysis standard deviation was estimated as zero for each of these characteristics

28 Influence of reported study design characteristics on average intervention effects and between-trial heterogeneity
in meta-analyses with all-cause mortality outcomes and also, for sequence generation and 
allocation concealment, in trials with other objectively assessed outcomes. Between-trial 
variability in bias was greatest for lack of or unclear double blinding, in meta-analyses with other 
objective or subjective outcomes. Results from analyses of combined study design characteristics 
were also broadly consistent with those from the hierarchical bias models.
Influence of reported study design characteristics: multivariable analyses
Table 18 presents results from multivariable analyses of the influence of inadequate or unclear 
allocation concealment and lack of or unclear double blinding, based on the 169 informative 
meta-analyses (1456 trials) in which both characteristics were assessed. Results from models 
without interaction terms are displayed in Figure 5: estimated RORs were similar to, or modestly 
attenuated compared with, the univariable analyses presented in Table 15. Estimated effects on 
heterogeneity were also modestly attenuated. Results from the model including interaction terms 
are displayed in Figure 6. RORs for the interaction between inadequate or unclear allocation

concealment and lack of double blinding were close to 1, with wide CIs. Therefore, these results 
are consistent with the effects of these two characteristics being multiplicative.
Results from multivariable analyses of the influence of all three study design characteristics 
are presented in Table 19 and displayed in Figure 7. Estimated RORs for each study design 
characteristic were of similar magnitudes to those in the univariable analyses presented in 
Table 16. For inadequate or unclear sequence generation or allocation concealment, estimated 
increases in between-trial heterogeneity (quantified by κ) were smaller in multivariable analyses 
than in the corresponding univariable analyses (see Table 16). Estimates of between-meta￾analysis variability in average bias changed little compared with univariable analyses.

FIGURE 5 Estimated RORs and effects on heterogeneity from multivariable analyses, according to type of outcome 
measure. Analyses based on trials with assessments of both allocation concealment and blinding. Upper panel, 
influence of inadequate or unclear versus adequate allocation concealment, adjusted for blinding; lower panel, influence 
of lack of double blinding or unclear blinding status versus double blinding, adjusted for allocation concealment.
Analyses according to type of intervention and clinical area.
Results from univariable analyses of the influence of the three study design characteristics 
according to clinical area are shown in Table 20. For pregnancy and childbirth – the clinical area 
contributing most meta-analyses to the combined data set – RORs were further from 1 than in 
the analyses of the whole data set displayed in Figure 3 and Table 14, whereas estimates of effects 
on heterogeneity were broadly consistent with analyses of the whole data set. For the other two 
clinical areas, RORs were attenuated towards 1. Only small numbers of meta-analyses contributed 
to estimation of κ, but estimated values of κ and φ were generally smaller for circulatory system 
meta-analyses than for the other two clinical areas.
Table 21 displays results of univariable analyses restricted to pharmacological and surgical 
interventions. The majority of meta-analyses included in the full data set addressed 
pharmacological interventions; it was therefore unsurprising that overall results restricted to 
such interventions were consistent with those from the full data set. For surgical interventions, 
the influence of inadequate or unclear sequence generation and allocation concealment was 
estimated from only six and nine meta-analyses respectively: CIs were too wide to allow 
substantive conclusions to be drawn.
Analyses of meta-analyses comparing two active interventions
For meta-analyses comparing two active interventions we estimated increases in between-trial 
(within-meta-analysis) heterogeneity in trials with, compared with trials without, a study design 
characteristic of interest (among meta-analyses containing at least two trials with and without the 
characteristic of interest). Based on eight meta-analyses containing 84 trials, the between-trial 
standard deviation (corresponding to κ in previous analyses) for trials with inadequate or unclear 
(compared with adequate) sequence generation was 0.35 (95% CrI 0.02 to 0.88), similar to the 
estimate for inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) allocation concealment (0.36, 
95% CrI 0.02 to 0.88, based on six meta-analyses containing 52 trials). The estimated increase

in heterogeneity was somewhat lower for lack of or unclear (compared with adequate) double 
blinding (0.24 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.79, based on seven meta-analyses containing 58 trials).

 were combined in a study previously reported by Wood et al.,16 which used 
a meta-meta-analytic approach for statistical analyses.8
 A total of 123 meta-analyses (1066 trials) 
were contributed by other meta-epidemiological studies. Table 22 shows numbers of contributing 
meta-analyses and results from univariable analyses of the influence of the three study design 
characteristics, both overall and separately according to type of outcome measure. Compared 
with the full data set, estimated RORs tend to be closer to the null, except for the influence of 
inadequate or unclear (compared with adequate) sequence generation in meta-analyses with 
subjective outcomes (ROR 0.86, 95% CrI 0.75 to 0.97). However, effects on the between-trial 
heterogeneity are broadly consistent with those for the main analyses reported in Table 14, with 
between-trial heterogeneity increased in meta-analyses with subjective outcomes, for all study 
design characteristics.

Univariable three-category analyses
Table 23 presents results from analyses of all trials in which reported methodological 
characteristics were assessed in three categories (low, unclear or high risk of bias). The number 
of trials and meta-analyses contributing to each analysis are shown in Table 24. There were no 
consistent patterns when comparing RORs for unclear (compared with low) and high (compared 
with low) risk of bias, which provides some support for combining these effects in the main 
analyses. Consistent with the main analyses, estimated values of κ were greatest for meta-analyses 
with subjectively assessed outcomes, both for high and unclear (compared with low) risk of bias.
Downweighting potentially biased evidence in future meta-analyses
Table 25 presents implications of the results from the primary univariable analyses (see Table 14) 
for downweighting of potentially biased evidence in future meta-analyses, based on formulae 
from Welton et al.
26 Because estimated values of κ and φ were greatest for meta-analyses 
with subjectively assessed outcomes, the minimum variance of the estimated intervention 
effect for a trial at high or unclear risk of bias is greatest for such trials. Across all BRANDO 
trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation, bias adjustment led to a median 10% 
(IQR 4% to 23%) increase in trial-level variance. Downweighting based on results specific to type 
of outcome measure has the greatest effect in trials with subjectively assessed outcomes [median 
20% (IQR 8% to 39%) increase in variance]. Results were broadly similar for downweighting 
based on inadequate or unclear allocation concealment. The median increase in variance for 
trials with subjectively measured outcomes that were not double blind or unclearly blinded was 
63% (IQR 22% to 138%).
Downweighting all trials with inadequate or unclear sequence generation led to a median 13% 
(IQR 5% to 32%) increase in the variance of the summary (meta-analytic) intervention effect 
estimate among informative meta-analyses in the BRANDO database. This is in contrast to a 
median increase of 217% (IQR 87% to 482%) that results from completely excluding such trials,

because only 26% of trials were assessed to have adequate sequence generation. Bias adjustment 
for meta-analyses with subjectively assessed outcomes led to a median 31% (IQR 11% to 56%) 
increase in the variance of the summary intervention effect estimate, which was again small 
compared with complete exclusion of such trials. Results were broadly similar for the other study 
design characteristics, although differences between the effects of downweighting and excluding 
trials at high or unclear risk of bias were smaller for double blinding, because 56% of trials 
from informative meta-analyses were double blind. Even for subjectively assessed outcomes, 
excluding trials not assessed as double blind led to a greater loss of precision than retaining but 
downweighting them [median increase in variance 36% (IQR 8% to 72%) for downweighting 
compared with median 62% (IQR 19% to 140%) for excluding].

Discussion
Summary of findings
Using data from 10 empirical (meta-epidemiological) studies, we developed a combined database 
for meta-epidemiological research. The database structure comprised six tables with defined 
relationships between them, which reflects the complexity of relationships between reviews, their 
publications, meta-analyses, trials and their publications, and trial characteristics and results. 
This database structure allowed us to identify duplicated entries, so that in the final database 
there were no overlaps between meta-analyses. This database design is potentially relevant to 
any situation in which collections of meta-analyses are being combined, and may also be of 
interest to researchers wishing to identify overlaps between two or more previously published 
meta-analyses.
We estimated the influence of three types of study design characteristic on average intervention 
effect estimates, and in increasing between-trial, within-meta-analysis, heterogeneity, in 1973 
trials (234 meta-analyses) for which information on both study design characteristics and trial 
results was available. Bias in intervention effect estimates resulting from inadequate or unclear 
sequence generation, inadequate or unclear allocation concealment or lack of or unclear double 
blinding varied according to the type of outcome measure assessed. Overall, there was little 
evidence of bias in trials assessing all-cause mortality or other objectively assessed outcomes. 
In contrast, inadequate sequence generation, inadequate allocation concealment or lack of 
blinding were associated with exaggerated estimates of the benefit of interventions in trials 
reporting subjectively assessed outcomes. The direction and magnitude of bias associated with 
reported study design characteristics varies between trials and meta-analyses, and with the 
type of outcome measure. Increases in between-trial heterogeneity associated with study design 
characteristics were greatest for trials reporting subjectively assessed outcomes. Except for the 
effect of lack of or unclear double blinding in trials reporting subjectively assessed outcomes, 
estimates of between-meta-analysis variability in mean bias were small. Analyses of the effects 
of combined study design characteristics suggested that effects of individual characteristics were 
less than multiplicative, in that estimated effects of two study design characteristics together were 
attenuated compared with the combined individual effects. Effects were somewhat attenuated in 
multivariable analyses.
Strengths and weaknesses
To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive attempt to date to quantify the 
influence of inadequate or unclear random sequence generation, inadequate or unclear allocation 
concealment and lack of or unclear double blinding on intervention effect estimates from RCTs. 
So far as we are aware, no previous study has quantified the effect of reported study design 
characteristics on between-trial heterogeneity as well as on average intervention effects, although 
Schulz et al.
11 noted that ORs from inadequately concealed trials appeared more heterogeneous 
than those from adequately concealed trials. Thanks to the generosity of their investigators, we 
were able to combine the results of all meta-epidemiological studies of which we were aware 
at the start of the study, with the exception of a study for which data were no longer available. 

42 Discussion
The size of the data set meant that we were able to quantify the influence of study design 
characteristics in subgroups defined by types of intervention, comparison and outcome measure.
Combining multiple collections of meta-analyses and removing overlaps is a labour-intensive 
process. We estimate that for the very large BRANDO study database this process took 
approximately 24 months’ person time. However, a substantial proportion of this time was 
devoted to database development and programming, which might be avoided in future studies. 
Harmonising the definition of trial characteristics across different studies was also time￾consuming. Nonetheless, de novo data extraction would have taken substantially longer. It would 
be difficult to publish results from a combined database in which the extent of overlap between 
meta-analyses was unknown. However, combining meta-epidemiological studies on different 
topics would likely avoid the need for a deduplication exercise.
Inadequate reporting of trial methods can severely impede the assessment of trial quality and the 
risk of bias in trial results. This is a particular problem for the assessment of sequence generation 
and allocation concealment, which are often not described at all in trial publications. Table 11
shows that, for 64% of trials with assessment of sequence generation and 69% of trials with 
assessments of allocation concealment, these characteristics were assessed as unclear. In most 
cases this was because the method was not described at all in the publication. Transparent and 
standardised reporting of trials is an essential part of clinical research. Many trials included in 
this data set were published before the publication of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials) recommendations in 1996.31,32 There is evidence that reporting of trials 
improved between 2000 and 2006, although it remained below an acceptable level.33
Our study was based on reported study design characteristics, which need not correspond to 
how a trial was in fact conducted: well-conducted trials may be reported badly.34 A study of 
discrepancies between published reports and the actual conduct of RCTs found that, in more 
than three-quarters of trials in which sequence generation or allocation concealment were 
unclear, these characteristics were in fact adequate,35 whereas Soares et al.
36 found that the 
methodology of 56 trials of radiation therapy in oncology was better than reported. In contrast, 
Pildal et al.
37 found that most trials with unclear allocation concealment on the basis of the 
trial publication also have unclear allocation concealment according to their protocol. A recent 
study of reporting of blinding suggested that, although reporting is often inadequate, it rarely 
contradicts the methods specified in the trial protocol.38
The study of Egger et al.
9
 relied on assessments of trial quality by the authors of the included 
Cochrane reviews rather than by methodological experts. Despite the standardised guidelines 
specified in the Cochrane Handbook39 at the time, evaluations by authors of Cochrane reviews of 
whether or not a study had adequate allocation concealment may be inconsistent.37 The effect of 
trial quality on estimates of intervention effect in this study was, however, in line with previous 
studies in which quality was assessed by the same observers: one would expect attenuation of 
effects if assessments in Cochrane reviews were less reliable.
As is common in Bayesian hierarchical modeling,28,29 we found a high degree of sensitivity of 
estimated variance components to the prior distributions assumed for these parameters. This 
is of concern because the estimates of κ and φ are of substantial interest, having the potential 
to drive downweighting of evidence from high or unclear risk trials in future meta-analyses, 
based on formulae from Welton et al.
26 Lambert et al.
28 have previously demonstrated an upward 
bias of Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimates of variance components when the true variance is 
very close to zero. We were, therefore, cautious in interpreting small estimates of heterogeneity 
parameters, and those for which the lower limit of the CI is close to zero.

We estimated the impact of downweighting trials in a new fixed-effect meta-analysis, based on 
our estimates of the influence of study design characteristics on intervention effect estimates. In 
practice, a random-effects model might have been preferable for many of the meta-analyses on 
which these results are based. The hierarchical bias model used to estimate κ2
, φ2
 and V0
 assumed 
random intervention effects within each meta-analysis, and can be expected to produce estimates 
of κ2
 and φ2
 that are smaller than those estimated from a fixed-treatment-effect model. These 
results should therefore be interpreted only as an approximate guide to the likely impact of bias 
adjustment in a new fixed-effect meta-analysis.
The present study in context with other literature
Because different meta-epidemiological studies have reported on similar associations (e.g. 
the association of inadequate or unclear concealment of allocation with intervention effect 
estimates), some authors have previously reported meta-analytic estimates combined across 
different meta-epidemiological studies.14 The validity of such estimates would be undermined if 
different meta-epidemiological studies were reporting on the same meta-analyses, but the extent 
of overlap has until now been unclear. Our study provides some reassurance in that only 69 (21%) 
meta-analyses (492 trial results, 16%) were contained in more than one meta-epidemiological 
study that had both recorded trial results and assessed study design characteristics.
The overlap between different meta-epidemiological studies provided an opportunity to examine 
the reliability of assessments of sequence generation, allocation concealment and double blinding 
between pairs of contributing studies. Overall, we found good agreement. This is encouraging 
given our aim of conducting combined analyses, particularly as assessments were carried out 
completely independently, and because definitions were not completely consistent between the 
different contributing studies. Double blinding was the characteristic for which there was the 
highest inter-rater agreement; this may be because the presence of and the methods for blinding 
tend to be better reported than the methods of sequence generation and concealment. It is 
relatively easy to identify that a trial has been reported as either ‘double blind’ or ‘open’, whereas 
no such standard terms exist for the randomisation process. A recent study by Hartling et al.
40
assessed inter-rater agreement between two independent reviewers who applied the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s risk of bias tool on a convenience sample of 163 published randomised trials. 
They found moderate to good agreement for sequence generation, allocation concealment 
and blinding, but in contrast to our study they observed the highest agreement for sequence 
generation (kappa=0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85) and lowest for the assessment of blinding 
(kappa=0.35; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.47). This could be because the new Cochrane guidelines41 for 
risk of bias assessment state that it is inappropriate to pass a judgement of a low risk of bias if the 
study is merely described as ‘double blind’ without further details, thus rendering the assessment 
of blinding less straightforward. Accurate measurement of methodological characteristics is 
essential for the validity of meta-epidemiological studies. Given that the average effects of such 
characteristics are modest,6,16 non-differential misclassification may dilute or even extinguish 
them, whereas differential misclassification could create spurious effects.
Despite the large number of meta-epidemiological studies that contributed to the BRANDO 
study, only the three study design characteristics, sequence generation, allocation concealment 
and double blinding, were consistently assessed across these studies. The Cochrane 
Collaboration’s risk of bias tool, which was first published in 200841 and was recently updated,42
includes assessment of the risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting 
of outcomes. There is recent empirical evidence of bias in the results of RCTs as a result of both 
attrition43,44 and selective outcome reporting.2,45,46 It is possible that our results were confounded 
by the influence of these or other types of bias, which could not be adjusted for. However, 

44 Discussion
estimated effects of the study design characteristics analysed in our study were only modestly 
attenuated in adjusted analysis. The influence of study design characteristics may also vary in 
clinical areas that were not well represented in the BRANDO database.47
Definitions of adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment were relatively 
consistent between the contributing studies (see Table 9). For allocation concealment, all studies 
adhered to the definitions originally formulated by Schulz et al.
11 In contrast, definitions used 
to assess a trial as double blind varied somewhat (see Table 9), with some being more strict11,14
than others: three studies9,12,21 considered a trial double blind merely if the trial report described 
it as double blind. However, we found that the assessment of double blinding was consistent 
between the contributing studies, with a median κ statistic of 0.87.17 The term ‘double blind’ is 
problematic because at least three distinct groups (trial participants, trial personnel and outcome 
assessors) can potentially be blinded. Both physicians and textbooks vary in their interpretations 
and definitions of ‘single’, ‘double’ and ‘triple’ blinding.48 We hope that future trials will report 
the blinding status of the different groups involved, as specified in the CONSORT statement,31,32
rather than using the vague term ‘double blind’.49 The recent update of the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s risk of bias tool42 separates assessment of the risk of performance bias (adequacy 
of blinding of participants and personnel) from assessment of the risk of detection bias (adequacy 
of blinding of outcome assessors).
Implications for research
The database structure that we developed may have wide applicability in evidence synthesis 
research. It has the potential to ensure data integrity and consistency in situations in which 
it is necessary to store data from multiple systematic reviews, or to accommodate multiple 
publications and multiple study designs in large systematic reviews. The database structure can 
be modified to store information on a variety of study types and additional facilities for duplicate 
data entry and checking have also been developed for different projects using the basic structure.
We found that a lack of or unclear double blinding was associated with marked exaggeration 
of intervention effect estimates and increases in between-trial heterogeneity in trials with 
subjectively assessed outcome measures. This is consistent with there being more prominent 
placebo effects in such trials.50,51 It is possible that placebo effects are themselves of clinical utility. 
It would be of great interest to examine separate effects of blinding of participants and personnel 
(performance bias) and blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias) once such assessments are 
available from large collections of trials and meta-analyses.
In contrast to previous studies,9,11 we found the influence of lack of double blinding to be greater 
than that of inadequate or unclear random sequence generation or allocation concealment. Our 
finding that the influence of these last two study design characteristics is most marked for trials 
with subjectively assessed outcomes was unexpected, although it is consistent with the results 
of Wood et al.
16 for allocation concealment. The purpose of random sequence generation and 
allocation concealment is to avoid selection bias, whereby knowledge of prognosis at the time 
of recruitment to a randomised trial influences the intervention group to which the patient is 
allocated.52 Such selection bias would be expected to be greatest when it is easy to assess patients’ 
prognosis at the time they are recruited to a trial, and affect the results of trials with objectively 
assessed as well as subjectively assessed outcome measures. As shown in Table 12, presence of 
double blinding was associated with adequate allocation concealment but not with adequate 
sequence generation. The influence of sequence generation and allocation concealment in trials 
with subjectively assessed outcomes was little attenuated in multivariable analyses. Therefore, 
these effects may result at least in part from their association with subsequent flaws in the

conduct of trials, in particular with biased outcome assessment, rather than from selection 
bias. Adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment may also be markers for other 
strategies for reducing bias, beyond blinding.
Ownership of the BRANDO database remains with the investigators of the contributing studies. 
However, the steering group would be happy to consider requests for access to the database once 
the main study results are published.
Recommendations for future research
Tools for assessing risk of bias in results of RCTs41,42 and guidelines for summarising the quality 
of evidence from systematic reviews53 should account for the findings of this study. In particular, 
it appears that when study design characteristics associated with bias prevention are not in place, 
trial results based on subjectively assessed outcome measures are at greatest risk of bias.
Practical and acceptable methods for correcting and downweighting the results of trials at 
high risk of bias in new meta-analyses should be developed. The trade-off between bias and 
variation is a familiar problem in statistics: our results suggest that exclusion of trials at high risk 
of bias leads to much greater decreases in precision than empirically based downweighting of 
such studies.
The influence of further study design characteristics should be explored in new meta￾epidemiological studies based on more recently reported trials than are available in the BRANDO 
database. These include the influence of incomplete outcome data and selective reporting of 
outcomes, examining separate effects of blinding of participants and personnel (performance 
bias) and blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias) and the influence of characteristics 
specific to particular study designs (e.g. carry-over effects in crossover trials). It would also be of 
interest to examine clinical areas that are not well represented in the BRANDO data set.
Bayesian models could be extended to deal with misclassification of study design characteristics, 
based on empirical evidence such as that presented in Table 5.
Our results suggest that, as far as possible, clinical and policy decisions should not be based on 
trials in which blinding is not feasible and outcome measures are subjectively assessed. Therefore, 
trials in which blinding is not feasible should focus as far as possible on objectively measured 
outcomes, and should aim to blind outcome assessors.

SUMMARY OF RESEARCH
ABSTRACT OF RESEARCH. No more than 200 words covering the following topics: aims of project; research 
subject group; sample size, type and location; methods of working.
This project aims to examine the importance of different types of bias and other sources of variability in 
estimates of the effect of health care interventions, in different settings and areas of medicine. An existing 
database will be extended to combine data from all existing ‘meta-epidemiological’ studies of the effect of 
methodological quality and other trial characteristics on intervention effect estimates in randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs). Based on the results of a review conducted by the applicants, we will also assemble a new 
database that will be used to compare results of RCTs and non-randomised studies (NRS) that estimated the 
effects of comparable interventions on comparable outcomes. We will use a database of NRS examining the 
association of diet and physical activity with cancer to quantify differences in the magnitude of associations 
between types of non-randomised study. Statistical methods developed by the applicants will be extended 
to quantify differences in intervention effect estimates and the between-meta-analysis variability in these 
differences. These will lead to further development of guidelines for the conduct and reporting of RCTs and 
NRS, and to evidence-based methods for combining results of RCTs of varying quality, and RCTs and NRS, in 
systematic reviews of health care interventions.
II DETAILS OF PROPOSED RESEARCH
Background
Bias in randomised controlled trials
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the best evidence in the evaluation of medical 
interventions. However, the number of patients included in trials is often inadequate and single 
trials may fail to detect, or exclude with certainty, a modest but medically important difference 
in the effects of two therapies.1,2 An examination of clinical trials which reported no statistically 
significant differences between experimental and control therapy showed that false negative 
results in health care research are common: for a medically important difference in outcome 
the probability of missing this effect given the trial size was greater than 20% in 115 (85%) of 
the 136 trials examined.1
 Similarly, a recent examination of 1941 trials relevant to the treatment 
of schizophrenia showed that only 58 (3%) studies were large enough to detect a modest but 
important improvement.3
 Although there is some evidence that the number of patients included 
in trials published in general health care journals has increased,4
 under-powered trials continue 
to be published in large numbers.5
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses aim to address this situation. Statistical combination 
of results from several small trials in meta-analysis will increase the precision of estimated 
treatment effect, reduce the probability of ‘false negative’ results, and potentially lead to more 
timely introduction of effective treatments.6
 Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide the 
basis for development of sound clinical practice guidelines and, in general, for evidence based 
health care.7,8
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are not immune to bias, however. The majority of 
published meta-analyses are based on relatively few, small trials.9,10 Small trials tend to show 
bigger treatment effects than larger trials, a difference that may be due to publication bias 
and related reporting biases such as time lag bias or language bias, or bias due to inadequate 
methodological quality, both of which are more common among small trials. Such bias may 
distort the results from meta-analyses.11,12 Bias in randomised controlled trials research has been 
examined by considering collections of meta-analyses in which component trials are classified 
according to characteristics such as study quality or publication type. The landmark study by

have examined the influence of different types of biases on the results of systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Such studies, which are based on meta-regression 
analyses of several meta-analyses, have been termed ‘meta-epidemiological’ studies to distinguish 
them from standard meta-analyses.20 The applicants include investigators from all identified 
studies of this type.12–19,21–23
These studies have so far identified two dimensions of trial quality that are empirically 
associated with bias: concealment of the allocation sequence (to prevent selection bias) and 
blinding (keeping the trial participants, care providers and outcome assessors unaware of which 
intervention is being administered).11,12,15 Biased dissemination of the results of trials (publication 
bias, language bias) may also affect meta-analyses.24 For none of these factors are the data 
unequivocal, however:17 more work is needed to increase confidence in the findings. Further, 
the relative importance of different sources of bias is unclear at present. A recent comparison 
of results from these studies indicated that trial quality appears to be more important than the 
reporting and dissemination of results.25 However, such comparisons are problematic. First, the 
definitions of allocation concealment, double blinding etc. varied to some extent across studies. 
Second, there is a degree of overlap between studies in the meta-analyses included. Third, most 
studies used logistic regression models in which the evidence for interaction between the effects 
of trial quality and intervention group is examined, after controlling for the interaction between 
meta-analysis and treatment group. This assumes that the effect of bias is constant across meta￾analyses. If this assumption is false then standard errors of estimated differences will be too small. 
We have proposed new methods that address these problems, and shown that both within and 
between meta-analysis heterogeneity may be of importance.20 These methods require further 
development, in particular to control for confounding effects of different trial characteristics 
within a modelling framework that allows appropriately for between meta-analysis variability in 
the effects of trial characteristics. It would also be desirable to extend this work to different effect 
measures (for example mean difference, hazard ratio, risk ratio) in addition to odds ratios.
Such influences are likely to vary according to clinical context, but none of the existing studies 
was large enough to examine this. Specific issues apply in some specialties for which we have 
limited data, for example surgery and vaccination. Furthermore, much of the literature included 
in the existing studies is rather old, with a minority of studies from the 1990s. It would be 
interesting to examine whether improved reporting of trials since the CONSORT statement 
(Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Randomised Trials)26,27 has changed the impact of 
poor trial quality on meta-analyses, although inevitably the number of post-CONSORT trials 
included in published meta-analyses is relatively small. In interpreting trends over time it will be 
important to realise that CONSORT deals mainly with reporting of trials and may have changed 
reporting behaviour rather than actual conduct. This could lead to the attenuation of apparent 
associations of trial quality with intervention effect estimates over time.
More information on the epidemiology of bias in randomised clinical trial research is essential 
to provide a reliable methodological underpinning for unbiased conduct and appropriate 
interpretation of systematic reviews, meta-analysis and guidelines. Meta-analyses have sometimes 
been found to produce misleading results.28,29 At present, unreliable answers are being generated 
by small randomised studies of doubtful quality and meta-analyses based on such trials give the 
illusion of reliability.30 These trials and meta-analyses are nevertheless often the best available 
evidence, and as such are used to guide decision making in clinical practice. The collaborative 
research proposed here brings together the leading investigators in the field, and will represent 
the most comprehensive study ever done in this area. A number of new research questions will be 
addressed. The results will have considerable impact on clinical trials research, the practice and 
interpretation of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and the delivery of effective health care.

58 Appendix 1 
Bias in non-randomised studies
Several scenarios remain under which an RCT may be unnecessary, inappropriate, impossible 
or inadequate.31 Examples include the assessment of rare side-effects of treatments, some 
preventive interventions and policy changes. Furthermore, there must be hundreds of examples 
of interventions for which RCTs would be possible but have not yet been carried out, leaving the 
medical and policy community to rely on non-randomised evidence only. There are instances 
where non-randomised studies have either been sufficient to demonstrate effectiveness, or where 
they appear to have arrived at results similar to those of RCTs. However, where randomisation is 
possible, most agree that the RCT should be the preferred method of evaluating effectiveness.32–34
The risks of relying solely on non-randomised evidence include failing to convince some 
people of the validity of the result, or successfully convincing others of an incorrect result.33 It 
would be of value to have clear estimates of the degree to which non-randomised studies may 
be biased, and whether the bias is consistent across clinical settings, to assist interpretation of 
non-randomised evidence.
There is inconsistent use of nomenclature when describing non-randomised studies (NRS), and 
other taxonomies may apply different definitions to the same study designs. To attempt to avoid 
the problems of inconsistent terminology, six features can be identified that differentiate between 
these studies. First, some studies make comparisons between groups, whilst some simply describe 
outcomes in a single group (e.g. case series). Second, comparative designs differ in the way 
that participants are allocated to groups, varying from the use of randomisation (RCTs), quasi￾randomisation, geographical or temporal factors (comparative cohort studies), the decisions of 
health care professionals (clinical database cohorts), to the identification of comparison groups 
with specific outcomes (case–control studies). Third, studies differ in the degree to which they 
are prospective (and therefore planned) or retrospective, for matters such as the recruitment 
of participants, collection of baseline data, collection of outcome data and generation of 
hypotheses. Fourth, the method used to investigate comparability of the groups varies: in RCTs 
no investigation is necessary (although it is often carried out), in controlled before-and-after 
designs baseline outcome measurements are used, whilst in cohort and case–control studies 
investigation of confounders is required. Fifth, studies differ in the level at which the intervention 
is applied: sometimes it is allocated to individuals, other times to groups or clusters. Finally, some 
studies are classified as experimental whilst others are observational. In experimental studies 
the study investigator has some degree of control over the allocation of interventions. Most 
importantly he/she has control over the allocation of participants to intervention groups either 
using randomisation of participants, or haphazard allocation by alternation, dates of birth, day of 
the week or case record numbers. In observational studies, on the other hand, the groups that are 
compared are generated according to variation in the use of interventions that occurs regardless 
of the study. When allocation is determined largely by health professionals, the treatment 
decision is based not only on ‘hard’ data such as age, sex and diagnostic test results, but on ‘soft’ 
data including type and severity of symptoms, rate of development of the illness, and severity 
of any co-morbid conditions, which are rarely made explicit.35 Allocation in non-randomised 
studies may also be based on factors such as availability of care or geographical location. In 
non-randomised studies, therefore, there are likely to be systematic differences in the case-mix 
of patients in the intervention and comparison groups. Furthermore, some participants may not 
have been eligible for all the treatments being considered in the study.
The degree to which non-random allocation methods are susceptible to selection bias and 
therefore may produce biased estimates of the effect of treatment is not clearly understood, 
although it seems likely that the potential for bias will vary between clinical areas. It is 
reasonable to expect that the comparability of the groups in terms of prognostic factors, and 
the extent to which prognosis influences both selection for treatment and treatment outcome, 
will be of particular relevance. For example, in evaluations of childhood vaccines there are few

indicators of prognosis that could be used to influence allocation, so randomisation may not 
be necessary (although there are dangers that allocation in clusters could be confounded by 
exposure to infectious disease, which means that in practice randomisation is recommended). 
By contrast, when patient factors could have a strong influence on allocation or where prognosis 
is strongly linked to outcomes (such as in cancer treatment), then randomisation is likely to be 
extremely important.
The use of meta-epidemiology has been informally extended from the comparison of design 
features of RCTs to comparisons between different study designs. A recent HTA report for which 
one of the applicants was lead author36 identified 8 empirical studies37–44 (7 from the medical 
field) that compared the results of RCTs with those from non-randomised studies across multiple 
interventions to estimate the bias removed by randomisation. Between study-design comparisons 
were noted to be particularly challenging because of the magnitude of potential meta-confounding
of study design with differences in participants, interventions, outcomes and other features of 
study design, and because of the likelihood that any bias would act to inflate the variability of 
estimates as well as acting in a systematic manner.
The conclusions of the eight comparisons of RCTs and NRS are divergent, and all the 
comparisons were noted to have methodological weaknesses. There are issues as to whether 
identification of included studies was likely to be biased, the similarity of participants, 
comparability of interventions and outcome measures between RCTs and NRS, whether study 
methodology was similar in all respects other than the allocation mechanism, and the definitions 
used to assess whether results of RCTs and NRS revealed differences or were similar. The only 
robust conclusion that can be drawn is that in some circumstances the results of randomised 
and non-randomised studies differ, but it cannot be proved that differences are not due to other 
confounding factors. The frequency, size and direction of the biases cannot be judged reliably 
from the information presented in the literature to date. The current study will contribute to 
clarifying these issues and inform the interpretation of single NRS and systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses of NRS. The results will also inform the development of guidelines for the 
reporting of NRS, the Standards for the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
(STROBE) initiative, which is led by two of the applicants (Matthias Egger, Douglas Altman) and 
is supported by the Research Methodology Programme.
Aim
To examine the importance of different types of bias and other sources of variability in estimates 
of the effect of health care interventions, in different settings and areas of medicine.
Objectives
Overall objectives:
1. To implement and enhance recently developed statistical methods to quantify the 
implications for systematic reviews of the estimated mean and variance of the bias associated 
with different study characteristics, before and after controlling for confounding between 
different sources of bias.
2. To examine:
i. the extent of associations between the different dimensions of methodological quality, 
publication bias and other reporting biases and the degree of confounding between them
ii. the relative importance of different biases and study characteristics in terms of distortion 
of combined effect estimates
iii. the relative importance of different biases and study characteristics as sources of 
between-study heterogeneity
iv. the implications of bias and other sources of between-study heterogeneity for the 
conduct and analysis of systematic reviews of the effect of health care interventions.

60 Appendix 1 
3. To inform the development of improved guidelines for the conduct and reporting of 
randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies.
Workstream A: Bias and other sources of variability in the results of 
randomised controlled trials
1. To extend and analyse a combined database of randomised trials included in meta-analyses 
that have been assessed according to standard methodological criteria. As part of this 
process, to refine definitions of blinding and intent to treat analysis, taking into account the 
feasibility of blinding patients, care givers and outcome assessors, and the explicit reporting, 
or otherwise, of exclusions from the analysis.
2. For comparisons of randomised controlled trials: to estimate the mean and variance of the 
bias comparing:
i. adequately concealed trials with trials where concealment was inadequate and/or 
remained unclear
ii. trials using different degrees of blinding with open trials, and whether the importance 
of blinding varies between trials with ‘hard’ outcomes (e.g. mortality) and those 
with more subjective outcomes such as pain relief or patient satisfaction with the 
treatment regimen.
iii. trials analysed according to the intent to treat principle with other trials
iv. mode of generation of the randomisation sequence
v. trials with varying lengths and completeness of follow up
vi. trials where the sponsor does and does not have a commercial interest in the results in 
different fields of medicine, different types of trial and different settings defined by the 
presence or absence of known prognostic factors. It should be noted that although some 
of these differences have already been estimated in published studies, there is little or no 
published information on the between-meta-analysis variation in these differences.
Workstream B: Bias and other sources of variability in the results of 
non-randomised studies, compared to randomised controlled trials
1. To use a standardised assessment procedure to assemble a new database of sets of 
randomised trials and non-randomised studies that compared the effect of the same 
intervention on the same outcome.
2. For comparisons of randomised controlled trials with non-randomised studies estimating 
the same intervention effect: to estimate the mean and variance of the bias comparing:
i. randomised and non-randomised studies
ii. different types of non-randomised studies
iii. different strategies for dealing with confounding (e.g. logistic regression, 
propensity score)
iv. different settings defined by the presence or absence of known prognostic factors 
(e.g. trials in oncology versus vaccine trials, or paediatric trials, which tend to be 
particularly small).
3. To inform the development of guidelines for the conduct and reporting of randomised 
controlled trials and non-randomised studies, and systematic reviews of these studies.
Research methods
The project will involve the construction and analysis of two large databases to be used for 
empirical research on bias and other sources of variability in estimates of the effect of health 
care interventions. The first database will contain information on the characteristics and results 
of randomised controlled trials included in meta-analyses, and will be the responsibility of 
the research associate to be based in Bristol and directly supervised by Jonathan Sterne (see 
Workstream A below). The second database will contain information on the characteristics and 
results of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies that evaluated comparable

interventions using comparable outcomes, and will be the responsibility of the research associate 
to be based in Oxford and directly supervised by Jon Deeks (see Workstream B below). Data 
analyses, using the methods described in the section on data analysis, will be the responsibility of 
the project statistician, supervised by Jonathan Sterne, Jon Deeks and Douglas Altman.
Although there appears to be symmetry between Workstreams A and B, in reality there are 
some important differences. In A we will be looking at effect modifiers (methodological and 
other) within the class of RCTs to explain variation among RCTs. In B we will examine the 
magnitude, extent of and reasons for variation between RCTs and NRS, and perhaps also within 
different types of NRS. Several good studies of effect modifiers in RCTs (the studies in Table 1) 
have already been published, and we propose to build on this work. In contrast, there is (to our 
knowledge) no published evidence for B. Although there are several studies comparing RCTs and 
NRS (Table 2), none looked in detail at the characteristics of the RCTs and NRS included in those 
reviews, and there is little information on the magnitude of effect modification comparing RCTs 
and NRS or between different designs of NRS. Given that Workstream B starts from a much 
lower knowledge base than Workstream A and also is more complex than Workstream A, the 
objectives for B are more limited than for A.
Workstream A: Bias and other sources of variability in the results of 
randomised controlled trials
Identification of relevant studies
Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses which involve obtaining individual information 
or ‘raw data’ on all patients included in each of the trials included in the review have, in a 
number of cases, produced definitive answers which might not have been obtained in any other 
way.45,46 Similarly, in the realm of empirical studies of bias, a collaborative individual trial data 
(ITD) meta-analysis will overcome the problems mentioned above by eliminating duplicates, 
standardising definitions and collaboratively developing an appropriate strategy for the analysis 
of the common database.
We have identified 11 relevant meta-epidemiological studies of randomised trials: 10 are 
published11–19,23 and 1 is ongoing.21 The lead investigators of all of these studies (characteristics 
summarised in Table 1) have agreed to participate in this project. Meta-analyses included in these 
studies were mainly identified from Cochrane reviews, from existing databases or from searches 
of medical journals. Although definitions used in published articles differed it was feasible to 
establish common definitions for dimensions of trial quality.
Assembly of database for empirical research
Data sets from 7 studies11,13,15,16,18,19,23 have been combined to form a comprehensive database 
of systematic reviews and trials. This contains a common set of variables based on agreed 
definitions. This work has been done in Bristol as part of an MRC-supported PhD project by Mrs 
Lesley Wood (who has agreed to collaborate on the project); and has been further supported by a 
grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation.
The unique PMID identifier from PubMed/MEDLINE was assigned to all published meta￾analyses and trials from these datasets whenever such an identifier was available. Where there is 
no PMID the unique identifier from EMBASE was used if available; if not then a unique database 
ID was assigned. The common database includes 2948 unique trials in 264 unique meta-analyses 
of which 174 (59%) were extracted from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. There 
was surprisingly little duplication: only 363 trials and 23 meta-analyses appeared in two or more 
of the studies. The original papers for duplicated trials and meta-analyses have been obtained. 
However, there were differences in the definition of components of trial quality between 

62 Appendix 1 
meta-epidemiological studies: for example, a paper that described allocation concealment 
using sealed envelopes without providing further details might or might not be coded as 
adequately concealed.
We will extend the database to include all the additional studies that have been identified, and 
aim to continue to maintain and update the database as required for future studies.
Extraction of additional data
We will compile a complete set of the original publications and extract additional information 
on trials or reviews where current information is inconsistent or incomplete. This process will 
be informed by recent research and debate on definitions of components of quality such as 
blinding.47 For some trial characteristics (e.g. whether published and language of publication) it 
will be relatively straightforward to add information, while other study characteristics, such as 
length and completeness of follow up, have not been considered in any of the existing studies and 
will therefore be more difficult to add. If accumulation of complete data is not cost-effective we 
will collect information on a subset of trials and/or meta-analyses.
We will identify areas in which the identification and inclusion of additional meta-analyses and 
trials is required to address our objectives. For example, we may need to identify additional 
meta-analyses in surgery and of vaccine trials, or to include recently published meta-analyses. 
We intend to examine at least nine areas in conventional medicine (cardiovascular, oncology, 
obstetrics and gynaecology, rheumatology, psychiatry, paediatrics, infectious diseases, surgery 
and vaccine trials). Similarly, we may have to add meta-analyses of trials with certain types of 
outcome measures or interventions to address some of the objectives. We will adopt a strategic 
approach and make optimal use of the information available from the existing studies. However, 
we anticipate that, in addition to collecting additional information on trials and meta-analyses 
already in the database, we will be able to add approximately 20 meta-analyses and 200 trials to 
the database.
Investigations
The primary comparison will be between results of RCTs with different characteristics (e.g. 
components of methodological quality). We will use statistical methods developed by the 
applicants (see below) to estimate the average effect of the characteristics, the overall variability 
in these effects and the extent to which such variability is explained by factors such as medical 
specialty or the presence of known prognostic factors. These analyses will also investigate the 
extent of confounding between different study characteristics (for example low quality studies 
may also be less likely to be published). We will quantify the implications of our findings for 
systematic reviews in which studies of varying quality are located.
Workstream A will be conducted primarily by the research associate based in Bristol, supervised 
by Jonathan Sterne and Matthias Egger, with additional regular input from Jon Deeks, Douglas 
Altman and other applicants.
Workstream B: Bias and other sources of variability in the results of 
non-randomised studies, compared to randomised controlled trials
There are major challenges in investigating differences between the findings of randomised and 
non-randomised studies. In what follows we outline the issues that we wish to examine, but we 
realise that it will not be possible to resolve them all. The main impediments are the subjectivity 
of some of the judgements (e.g. the comparability of interventions in randomised and non￾randomised settings) coupled with the quality of the available information in published reports 
of the primary studies. Thus, the planned analyses will only be carried out if the available data

make them possible. By attempting to address these difficult issues we will help to clarify what is 
possible and what is not possible in this important area of research.
Identification of relevant studies
Empirical studies comparing randomised and non-randomised studies were identified as part 
of the published HTA report.36 Seven studies in medical fields were found, evaluating a total of 
82 interventions after accounting for duplication between studies (characteristics summarised 
in Table 2).37–43 A separate database will be constructed along the same lines as for randomised 
trials. Here, additional fields will identify the study design (RCT, cohort study, case–control study, 
etc.) and other characteristics relevant to non-randomised studies. We will search for additional 
publications that have compared results of RCTs and NRS within multiple meta-analyses, and for 
other studies that have compared the results of RCTs and NRS.48 One important and untapped 
resource for location of such studies is the Evidence-based Practice Center evidence reports 
(http://www.ahcpr.gov/clinic/epcix.htm). Currently there are 13 EPCs in North America. Their 
remit is to conduct systematic reviews in a very wide variety of topics. Approximately 90 reviews, 
which include both randomised and non-randomised studies, have been completed, and these 
reviews have been able to ‘control’ (ensure comparability of) the intervention between RCTs 
and NRS.
Assembly of databases for empirical research
Workstream B will produce a similar common database for the meta-analyses of randomised 
and non-randomised studies included in the 7 existing empirical reviews of bias associated with 
non-randomisation. However, as the 7 empirical studies each included and assessed different 
dimensions of study design, execution and comparability of groups, the original publications for 
the included randomised and non-randomised studies will each be retrieved and reassessed using 
a standard protocol. In this work we will draw on the suggestions of Ioannidis and Lau.49
A substantial database containing the results of different types of NRS is being constructed 
during a systematic review of the relationship of diet and physical activity with bladder, prostate, 
kidney and skin cancer currently underway in Bristol (principal investigators Jonathan Sterne 
and George Davey Smith). All published information on associations between any aspect of 
diet or physical activity is being extracted and will be converted to estimates of the association 
between these exposures and the specified cancer. We have recorded both the type of NRS and 
key aspects of study quality (for example in case–control studies whether the control group was 
randomly sampled from a relevant population). Results of the studies are being transformed into 
common estimates of dose–response effect, according to an algorithm developed by Jonathan 
Sterne, Matthias Egger and colleagues. This database, which will contain the results of at least 500 
NRS, will be used to investigate differences between the results of NRS according to type of study, 
methodological quality and extent of control for confounding factors.
Extraction of data
An assessment protocol will be developed and its reliability assessed on a sample of studies. Once 
consensus on the content and wording of the tool is agreed, approximately 300 RCTs and 300 
non-randomised studies will be assessed and included in the database of RCTs and NRS. The 
database of RCTs will be linked with the Workstream A database to check whether any trials have 
already been assessed.
One area requiring development and detailed analysis will be assessing the similarity of 
interventions, populations and outcomes, as these may be major sources of confounding which 
prevent the impact of non-randomisation per se being evaluated. For example, a RCT that 
examined the effect of vitamin E supplementation might be considered comparable to a NRS in 
which the dominant source of vitamin E was supplements, but not to a NRS in which vitamin E 

64 Appendix 1 
was mainly of dietary origin. Another issue that is much less simple than for RCTs is to consider 
dimensions of methodological quality of NRS. The choice of aspects to consider will be informed 
by the review of Deeks et al.
36
A second question of interest is whether bias in non-randomised allocation is related to the 
health care context. The most important aspect is probably the degree to which individual 
prognoses of study participants is predictable. The magnitude of bias that can be introduced in 
allocation is limited by the accuracy with which prognoses can be made. In studies of primary 
prevention interventions, such as infant vaccination programs, little prognostic information is 
known, whereas in studies in the treatment of cancer detailed prognostic information is available. 
A method of classifying clinical topics according to the amount of prognostic knowledge the 
researcher can have will be developed, as far as possible blind to knowledge of the comparisons 
being studied, and used to stratify analyses comparing randomised and non-randomised 
allocation methods. (The same classification could also be investigated as a possible explanation 
for inconsistent results of the impact of methodological aspects of RCTs, such as allocation 
concealment, in Workstream A.) Additional concerns are the difference between alternative 
experimental and observational methods of constructing non-randomised control groups and 
the impact of different case-mix adjustment methods in NRS.
Investigations
The primary comparison will be between average results in RCTs with average results in 
comparable NRS. We will investigate the extent to which candidate predictors of effects of 
intervention among NRS (e.g. control of confounding, type of study) influence the comparison. 
We will need to consider the impact of methodological quality of the RCTs in making this 
comparison. In addition, we will investigate the possibility of greater heterogeneity among NRS 
after allowance for effect modifiers. A side-product of these analyses will be insight into possible 
differences between results from different types of NRS (e.g. case–control vs cohort).
With respect to the assessment of the nature of the interventions, two alternative analyses will 
be undertaken: (a) a restricted analysis where similarity of confounding factors is demonstrated; 
(b) an unrestricted analysis where all comparisons are included. This approach will allow (a) 
estimation of biases directly linked to allocation method, and (b) a more pragmatic assessment of 
the overall differences in findings between randomised and non-randomised evaluations.
The database on studies of diet and cancer will be used to estimate the association between 
characteristics of NRS, including type of study, methodological quality and extent of control for 
confounding factors, in the particular context of the association of diet and physical activity with 
the development of cancer.
We will quantify the implications of our findings for systematic reviews in which estimates of the 
effect of health interventions are available from both RCTs and NRS.
Workstream B will be conducted primarily by the research associate based in Oxford. Jon Deeks 
and Douglas Altman will provide day-to-day supervision, with additional regular input from 
Jonathan Sterne, Matthias Egger and other applicants.
Statistical methods and data analysis
We first describe statistical methods relevant to the analysis of meta-epidemiological studies. We 
then state the broad aims of the statistical analyses. Predicted outputs from the analyses appear in 
a separate section.

Standard logistic regression models
Suppose that we have data from M meta-analyses, containing a total of S studies. To estimate the 
effect of a binary study characteristic C (for example C=1 in published trials, 0 in unpublished 
trials) on estimated treatment effects we fit the model:
π β = + β β + +∑γ δ +∑ = =
logit( ) I I I I t tc i tm j s
j
S
i
M
0 1 2
2 2 i j
where π is the probability that an (adverse) outcome event is observed, I
t
, I
tc, {Itmi
} and {Isj
} are all 
indicator variables denoting, respectively, the effects of treatment, the treatment–characteristic 
interaction, the treatment–meta-analysis interactions and study number, and {β}, {γ} and {δ} 
are the parameters of the logistic regression model.20 This model allows the probability of the 
outcome event to vary according to treatment group, trial characteristic and trial, while the 
interaction terms {I
mi} mean that the effect of treatment is estimated separately in each meta￾analysis. The estimated effect of the characteristic C on average treatment effects is then given 
by parameter β2
 (treatment–characteristic interaction), which estimates the log of the ratio of 
treatment odds ratios (ROR) in trials with and without the characteristic. This is assumed to be 
constant across meta-analyses: violation of this assumption will lead to standard errors that are 
too small. Only meta-analyses that contain trials with and without the characteristic contribute 
to this estimate. Corresponding methods using linear regression can be used for meta-analyses in 
which the outcome is numerical, and mean differences can be converted to corresponding odds 
ratios to facilitate comparisons across meta-analyses.
Robust standard errors
The assumption that RORs are constant across meta-analyses can be examined via ‘robust’ 
standard errors, which use the ‘information sandwich’50,51 to estimate standard errors based 
on the regression residuals. Robust standard errors may also be estimated after allowing for 
clustering,52 providing that the number of clusters is at least 20.53
Meta-analytic approaches
If the effect of a trial characteristic varies between meta-analyses then analyses based on the 
logistic regression approach will underestimate the uncertainty in estimated RORs. An obvious 
alternative is to estimate the effect of the characteristic using a separate logistic regression in each 
meta-analysis (i.e. fixed-effect within meta-analyses). Estimated RORs in each meta-analysis can 
then be combined using meta-analytic methods, using inverse-variance weighting and either 
fixed-effect or random-effects between meta-analyses. Random-effects analyses use the moment￾based variance estimator (τˆ2
) proposed by DerSimonian and Laird.54 The fixed-effect assumption 
may also be violated within meta-analyses. This can be addressed by using random-effects meta￾regression to allow for between-trial (within meta-analysis) heterogeneity.55,56 Meta-regression 
examines associations between the estimated treatment effect (log OR) in each trial and one or 
more trial characteristics, allowing appropriately for the precision of the treatment effect via the 
standard error of the log OR in each trial. For a single meta-analysis, meta-regression estimates 
the same quantity (the ratio of ORs comparing trials with and without the characteristic) as 
is estimated using the logistic regression approach. In the absence of within meta-analysis 
heterogeneity the ratios of ORs estimated using meta-regression and logistic regression will 
be similar. Estimates of the between meta-analysis variance in the effect of trial characteristics 
are likely to be of key importance in synthesis of evidence from studies of different types (see 
‘Evidence synthesis’ below).
Random effects logistic regression and multilevel modelling
We have experience with all the methods described above20 but have not yet used two promising 
alternatives: first, the logistic regression approach could be extended to allow for random effects 

66 Appendix 1 
between or within meta-analyses and, second, a multilevel approach could be developed, based 
on summary treatment effect estimates from each trial.57 As well as providing estimates of both 
the effect of trial characteristics and the between meta-analysis variance in these effects, these 
approaches could have particular advantages in analyses that try to control for confounding 
effects of other trial characteristics, since the estimated effect of a characteristic in a particular 
meta-analysis would be shrunk towards the overall mean by an amount depending on the 
amount of information in the data for that meta-analysis. In analyses using the meta-analytic 
approach we have seen that the effect of trial characteristics is estimated very imprecisely, 
which will make it difficult to control for confounding effects. The logistic regression approach 
discussed above could obviously be used to control for confounding (for example between 
different components of methodological quality) by including the effects of more than one trial 
characteristic in the model. However, this assumes that the effect of each characteristic is constant 
across meta-analyses. An alternative is to estimate effects controlling for confounding factors 
separately in each meta-analysis, using random-effects meta-regression.
Evidence synthesis using recently developed methodology
Jonathan Sterne (lead applicant) and John Carlin (Professor, University of Melbourne 
Departments of Paediatrics and Public Health) have recently been developing methods to use the 
results of meta-epidemiological studies to provide estimates of the effect of interventions based 
on evidence from studies of differing methodological quality, or different types of study. We now 
briefly describe this: a paper is currently being prepared for publication.
We wish to combine the results of two types of studies to provide an overall estimate of the effect 
of a particular intervention. We will denote these two types of studies by H (high quality) and L
(low quality). Two examples are that H and L could be RCTs in which randomisation was and 
was not adequately concealed, or that H could be RCTs while L could be cohort studies.
We will assume that meta-analyses of the effect of the intervention are conducted separately in 
studies of the two types, leading to estimates β
ˆ
H and β
ˆ
L of the intervention effect. For 
meta-analyses based on binary outcomes, β
ˆ
H and β
ˆ
L will generally correspond to the log 
intervention odds ratios in type H and type L studies respectively. The variances of β
ˆ
H and β
ˆ
L
will be denoted by σ H
2
 and σ L
2
> respectively. Based on the usual assumption that intervention 
effect estimates from meta-analysis are asymptotically normally distributed, we will assume that 
β
ˆ
H ~N(µ,σ H
2 ) (β
ˆ
H is normally distributed with mean µ and variance σ H
2
). We will interpret µ as the 
(true) intervention effect in type H studies, where this is assumed to be constant across all studies 
(the usual ‘fixed effect’ assumption).
We will assume that in type L studies, the intervention effect is estimated with bias δ (in studies 
with binary outcomes, δ is the log of the ratio of intervention odds ratios comparing type 
L and type H studies). Therefore, β
ˆ
L ~N(µ+δ, σ L
2
). If δ were known, then we could obtain a 
corrected estimate of µ, based on the type L studies, as µ β ˆ = −δ ˆ L L . However, if δ is unknown, as 
will invariably be the case, the results of the type L studies cannot distinguish µ and δ without 
further assumptions.
A solution to this problem is to incorporate prior information about the bias δ, using a Bayesian 
framework. As described earlier, the effect of components of trial quality on intervention effect 
estimates, and the between meta-analysis variability in such effects, may be estimated in meta￾epidemiological studies, using data from collections of meta-analyses. For example, in a recent

re-analysis of the data of Schulz et al.11 the ratio of odds ratios (ROR) comparing studies that 
were not and were adequately concealed was 0.67 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.78), while the between￾meta-analysis variance in the log ROR was 0.065.20 We propose to formalise evidence about this 
variability in a prior distribution for δ, and a convenient assumption is a normal distribution: 
δ ~ N(δ0
,τ 0
2
), where δ0
 represents our best a priori estimate of the average bias in studies of type 
L, while τ 0
2
 describes uncertainty around this estimate. The results just quoted could motivate the 
particular specifications δ0=loge 0.67=–0.40 and τ 0
2
=0.1, say.
Based on these assumptions, it is straightforward to obtain the posterior distribution of the true 
intervention effect µ, given the information from both type H and type L studies. In particular, 
integrating over the prior distribution of δ, we obtain the marginal distribution of β
ˆ
L ~ N(µ+δ0
, 
σ L
2
+τ 0
2
).
It follows by standard normal distribution calculations,58 assuming a diffuse (‘noninformative’) 
prior distribution for µ, that the posterior distribution for µ given the combined data D=(β

is normal with mean and variance

Equations 1 and 2 show that the posterior mean of µ is a weighted average of the estimates of 
µ from the two types of studies (β
ˆ
H in the type H studies and β
ˆ
L –δ0
 in the type L studies), with 
weights [σ H
2
]–1 and [σ L
2
+τ 0
2
]–1 in the type H and type L studies respectively. It follows that τ 0
2
, 
the prior variability in the amount of bias, is key in determining the contribution of the type L
studies to the posterior mean of µ, since the larger is τ 0
2
, the smaller is the weight given to the 
type L studies. When τ 0
2
 is zero (the amount of bias is known with certainty), equations 1 and 2 
correspond to a standard inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of the estimates of µ from the 
two types of studies. As τ 0
2
 tends to infinity, the contribution of the type L studies tends to zero, 
and equations 1 and 2 simplify to give E(µ)=β
ˆ
H, Var(µ)=σ H
2
, so that the posterior information 
about µ corresponds to the information provided by the type H studies. Note also that the 
information from the type L studies is both corrected for bias and downweighted according to 
our uncertainty about the magnitude of the bias.
These statistical methods will be used to analyse data from workstreams A and B, during the 
second 12 months of the project. We will estimate both the mean differences in estimated effect 
of interventions, and the variation in these differences, according to characteristics of studies 
and types of studies, before and after controlling for the confounding effects of other study 
characteristics. This will lead to formal proposals, based on the methods for evidence synthesis 
described above on how to combine estimates of the effect of interventions from RCTs differing 
in quality and from different types of study.

on estimated treatment effects in randomised controlled trials, both overall and for the first 
time for different clinical settings, types of intervention, outcomes and trial designs.
■ Refined definitions of established markers of trial quality and identification of additional

criteria, primary and secondary outcomes), the degree of baseline imbalances, the number of 
centres involved, and the source of funding.
■ An improved understanding of the extent and effect of confounding between dimensions of

General
■ All analyses will lead to estimates of the between meta-analysis variation in the effect of study 
characteristics on intervention effect estimates. These will be used in analyses showing the 
effect of combining different types of studies in meta-analyses, based on the methods for 
evidence synthesis described earlier and incorporating prior estimates of both the expected 
bias and its variance.
■ Based on these results, and on refined methods of characterising trials developed as part 
of Workstream A, we will produce updated recommendations for the conduct, reporting 
and appraisal of randomised controlled trials, including revised editions of the CONSORT 
statement and the continuing development of the STROBE statement. All applicants will 
contribute to planning, conducting, interpreting and reporting these analyses. We will also 
aim to contribute to the continuing development of guidelines for the conduct and reporting 
of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including the QUORUM statement, particularly to 
the debate over whether and how to include studies of differing methodological quality and/
or different study designs.
■ Ultimately, the project will contribute to improved interpretation of existing evidence 
about the effect of medical interventions, the improved conduct and reporting of future 
randomised controlled trials and other evaluations of the effect of medical interventions, and 
hence to better medical care.
People
The team of applicants comprises the leading investigators in the field. All have extensive 
experience of conducting randomised trials and meta-analyses. Together, the team has links 
with clinical researchers in many branches of medicine, and covers a breadth of expertise, 
including clinical medicine and epidemiology (Egger, Ioannidis, Gluud, Pildal), methodological 
and reporting issues in randomised trials research (Altman, Schulz, Moher, Egger, Ioannidis), 
Cochrane methodology and Cochrane databases (Gluud, Ioannidis, Jüni, Pildal) and the 
statistical issues involved in the analysis of meta-epidemiological studies (Sterne, Altman, 
Ioannidis, Deeks, Schulz). Several applicants (Moher, Altman, Schulz, Egger, Ioannidis) are 
members of the CONSORT Group,26,27 the QUOROM Group (Moher, Altman) and the STROBE 
Group (Egger, Sterne, Altman) and most are affiliated to the Cochrane Collaboration. Three of 
the applicants (Egger, Moher, Sterne) are co-convenors of the Cochrane Reporting Bias Methods 
Group and two (Altman, Deeks) are co-convenors of the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group.
Dissemination of research results
We will disseminate our findings in journal articles and at national and international meetings. 
The final project report will be made available to organisations in the UK and worldwide 
that fund trials and systematic reviews. In particular, we will meet with representatives of 
the NHS Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme and the National Institute for 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) to discuss the implications of our findings for the research that 
they commission. We will prepare educational articles and materials, and will make particular 
efforts to disseminate these in specialist areas for which the research identifies problems with 
the conduct and reporting of trials. A number of the applicants and collaborators run regular 
workshops at meetings of the Cochrane Collaboration, and these, together with courses on 
randomised trials and systematic reviews run in Bristol and Oxford, will incorporate the results 
of the research as it becomes available. We will also discuss, with other colleagues involved in the 
Cochrane Collaboration, how the Cochrane Reviewers’ Handbook might be updated in the light 
of our results. Those applicants involved with the development and updating of the CONSORT 
statement on the reporting of randomised controlled trials will ensure that this is updated to 
take account of new empirical evidence on aspects of trial quality which emerges from the study. 
Perhaps the most powerful influence on the conduct and reporting of trials and systematic 
reviews is medical journals’ publication policies. Here, CONSORT has direct and indirect 
influence: direct through the membership of several editors of the most influential journals and 

70 Appendix 1 
indirect through endorsement from International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and 
Council of Science Editors. Similarly, the findings of this research will feed into updates of and 
extensions to the QUOROM and STROBE Statements.
