Abstract. The periostin protein, encoded by the POSTN gene, 
is a component of the extracellular matrix, which is expressed 
by fibroblasts and has been observed in a variety of human 
malignancies. The present study aimed to detect the expres￾sion of periostin in the tissues of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients and benign lung tumors, and to correlate the 
results with the clinicopathological data of the subjects, in order 
to evaluate periostin as a potential prognostic marker. In total, 
49 NSCLC patients and 6 benign lung tumors were included in 
this study. The protein level of periostin was detected in paired 
normal/paratumor/cancer tissues by a western blot analysis and 
the mRNA level in paired normal/cancer tissues was detected 
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results 
were then correlated with established biological and prognostic 
factors. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm the loca￾tion of periostin in the NSCLC tissues. Uni- and multivariate 
analyses were performed using Cox's proportional hazards 
regression model. The protein level of periostin was elevated 
in the cancer tissue of the NSCLC patients compared with 
the normal (P=0.017) and paratumor (P=0.000) tissues. The 
expression level in the male patients was much higher than 
in the female patients at the protein (P=0.001) and mRNA 
(P=0.010) levels. The mRNA level in the non-adenocarcinoma 
(non-ADC) patients was much higher than in the adenocarci￾noma (ADC) patients (P=0.029). Periostin was demonstrated 
higher expression at the protein level in the pseudotumors 
and tuberculosis patients than in the adjacent (P=0.016) and 
surrounding tissues (P=0.001). Immunostaining indicated 
that high levels of periostin were present in the mesenchymal 
areas, but not in the cancer cells themselves. The patients with 
tumors exhibiting high-level periostin expression showed a 
significantly shorter survival time (P=0.036, log‑rank test). 
The 3-year survival rate was 81.5% for patients with low-level 
periostin expression (periostin-L; n=27) and 45.4% for patients 
with high-level periostin expression (periostin-H; n=22). 
Similarly, pathological node (pN) status was a significant prog￾nostic marker in the univariate Cox survival analysis. Notably, 
periostin-H expression was also identified as an independent 
prognostic factor by the multivariate analysis (P=0.011). These 
results showed that the overexpression of periostin predicts 
a poor prognosis, therefore it may be regarded as a novel 
molecule in the progression and development of NSCLC. The 
results provide an additional target for the adjuvant treatment 
of NSCLC.
Introduction
Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer 
(1.6 million cases each year) and the most common cause 
of cancer mortality (1.18 million mortalities each year). 
The number of new cases and mortalities is progressively 
increasing every year. Lung cancer is not easily diagnosed. 
Only ~10% of lung cancer patients are alive 5 years after 
diagnosis. Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, 
comprising 17% of total new cancer cases and 23% of total 
cancer mortalities (1). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
the most common type of lung cancer. The development and 
progression of NSCLC is a complex process, and the tumor 
microenvironment plays an important role. The tumor micro￾environment is composed of structural (extracellular matrix), 
soluble (cytokines, proteases and hormones) and cellular 
components (tumor cells, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, 
vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, vascular smooth 
muscle cells and pericytic cells). In 1993, Takeshita et al (2) 
identified an 811-amino acid protein, named osteoblast 
specific factor-2 (OSF-2), which was secreted by the mouse 
MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell line. OSF‑2 has a typical signal 
sequence, followed by a cysteine-rich domain (EMI domain), 
a 4-fold repeated domain and a C-terminal domain. The 
4‑fold repeated domain shows homology with the insect 
protein, fasciclin I (2). Each of the 4-fold repeated domains 
has 150 amino acids, and 90-100 of these 150 amino acids are 
highly conserved, forming an area called the fas domain. As 
Overexpression of periostin predicts poor prognosis 
in non-small cell lung cancer

1596 HONG et al: OVEREXPRESSION OF PERIOSTIN IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER
OSF‑2 is also expressed by the periosteum and periodontal 
ligament, this protein was renamed periostin (3). In humans, 
the periostin gene (POSTN) is located on chromosome 13, at 
map position 13q13.3, and the protein is 835 amino acids in 
size and 90 kDa in molecular weight (4). Mouse and human 
periostin share 89.2% amino acid identity overall and 90.1% 
identity in their mature forms.
Periostin is expressed at the mRNA level by the majority 
of normal adult tissues, including the aorta, stomach, lower 
gastrointestinal tract, placenta, uterus and breast. The expres￾sion of periostin is high in fetal tissue at the mRNA and protein 
levels (5). Periostin protein expression is observed in normal 
adult tissues, including the adrenal glands, lung, thyroid, 
stomach, colon, vagina, ovary, testis and prostate, by western 
blot analysis (6). Periostin may be induced by transforming 
growth factor-β (TGF-β) (7) and Bmp-2 (8), and is involved in 
osteoblast recruitment, attachment and spreading (3). Periostin 
is considered to be a regulator of cardiac remodeling and 
hypertrophy and may be a suitable pharmacological target to 
mitigate heart failure (9).
Recently, periostin was identified as a novel factor in the 
growth, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis of numerous 
types of tumors. Periostin is overexpressed in various types 
of human cancer tissues, including ovarian cancer (5), chol￾angiocarcinoma (10), breast cancer (11), colon cancer (12), 
esophageal cancer (13), head and neck cancer (14), and 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (ADC) (15). Notably, peri￾ostin expression is well correlated with malignant behavior, 
including growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis and poor 
survival in ovarian cancer (5), cholangiocarcinoma (10), breast 
cancer (11), colon cancer (12), esophageal cancer (14) and 
pancreatic ductal ADC (15).
Periostin has also been detected in the serum of NSCLC by 
chemiluminescence assays. Notably, a previous study identified 
no significant difference between NSCLC patients and normal 
controls, and there was also no correlation between the serum 
periostin level and gender, stage, bone metastasis, lymph node 
status or primary tumor status. However, the NSCLC patients 
with high periostin levels had significantly poorer survival 
than the patients with normal periostin levels (16). Periostin 
mRNA has been shown to be upregulated in NSCLC tissue in 
relation to normal lung tissue, and also to be correlated with 
adeno cell subtype and higher tumor grade (17).
However, little information is available on the expression 
of periostin protein in NSCLC cancer tissues, and the correla￾tion between periostin expression and the clinicopathological 
characteristics of NSCLC patients is unknown. Previously, 
we identified that serum periostin was elevated in NSCLC 
patients compared with normal healthy volunteers, and 
showed that periostin promotes the proliferation and migration 
of A549 cells by inducing vimentin and N-cadherin expression 
and downregulating E-cadherin expression (18). In the present 
study, the mRNA and protein level of periostin in NSCLC 
and its correlation with established biological and prognostic 
factors were investigated. To provide evidence that the inac￾tivation of the periostin gene is a common event in NSCLC, 
periostin gene expression was examined at the transcriptional 
and translational levels in 49 paired normal/paratumor/cancer 
tissues, and the correlation between periostin expression and 
prognosis in NSCLC was assessed.
Materials and methods
Patients. Lung specimens from cancer tissues and paired para￾tumor tissues (with 1-2 cm distance from tumor edge) and normal 
tissues (with >5 cm distance from tumor edge) from 49 NSCLC 
patients (Table I) and 6 benign lung tumors (including 3 inflam￾matory pseudotumors and 3 pulmonary tuberculosis cases), 
who underwent pulmonary resection surgery, were included 
in this study. The samples were obtained by the Department of 
Cardiothoracic Surgery of Jinling Hospital (Nanjing, Jiangsu, 
China) between June 2007 and June 2008. All diagnoses were 
based on pathological evidence. Patients were grouped according 
to the size of the primary tumor (T), nodal involvement (N) and 
distant metastasis (M) to TNM stages I-IV according to the 
World Health Organization criteria for the TNM system and

staged appropriately. Patients did not receive chemo-, radio- or 
immunotherapy prior to surgery. The tissues were snap frozen 
and stored at -80˚C until use. This study was authorized by 
the principle committee of Jinling Hospital. Written informed 
consent was obtained from the patients.
Protein extraction and western blot analysis. Frozen tissues 
were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS), and homogenized on ice in 10 volumes (w/v) of lysis 
buffer [0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 1% NP-40, 
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA] containing 
complete protease inhibitor (PMSF+P8340). Subsequent to 
incubation on ice for 1 h and centrifugation at 12,000 x g 
for 15 min at 4˚C, the supernatant was collected and stored 
at -70˚C. The protein concentration was measured by the 
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Sigma, St. Louis, 
MO, USA). A total of 100 µg protein was separated by 5-10% 
SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 
which were saturated by incubation for 2 h with 5% skimmed 
dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/0.05% Tween-20 at 
37˚C. The membranes were then incubated with the rabbit 
polyclonal anti-periostin antibody (ab14041, 1:1,000; Abcam, 
Cambridge, MA, USA) overnight at 4˚C in blocking buffer (5% 
skimmed dry milk in TBS/0.05% Tween-20). Subsequent to 
being washed 4 times (5 min each) with TBS/0.05% Tween-20, 
the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit immuno￾globulin labeled with horseradish peroxidase (ab6721, 1:2,000; 
Abcam) at 37˚C in blocking buffer. After 1 h of incubation, the 
membranes were washed 4 times (5 min each) with TBS/0.1% 
Tween-20. Chemiluminescence was detected with an ECL 
western blot analysis detection kit (Pierce Biotechnology, 
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA), according to the manufacturer's 
instructions, and the results were quantified by densitometry 
using an Image System (GelDoc 2000; Bio-Rad). Polyclonal 
anti-β-actin (a housekeeping protein used as a loading control 
to assure equal amounts of protein in all lanes) antibody was 
used as a control.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was isolated 
from the frozen tissue with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA). Using random hexamer primers, 2 µg RNA was reverse 
transcribed to cDNA with a PrimeScript™ 1st Strand cDNA 
Synthesis kit (Takara Biotechnology, Inc., Shiga, Japan).
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Primers for 
POSTN and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH) were designed and synthesized by Takara 
Biotechnology, Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). The basic information 
of the primers including gene name, National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference, forward primer, 
reverse primer and product size (bp), respectively, were as 
follows: POSTN, NM_006475, CATTGATGGAGTGCCTGT 
GGA, CAATGAATTTGGTGACCTTGGTG and 167; and 
GAPDH, NM_002046, GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC, 
TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA and 138. qPCR was performed 
in triplicate for each sample in a 25-µl reaction mixture, which 
consisted of template DNA (2 µl), primers (0.2 µM), ROX 
Reference Dye II (1X), dH2O (9.0 µl) and SYBR® Premix Ex 
Taq [1X; SYBR Premix Ex Taq (perfect real-time) kit; Takara]. 
PCR was performed using a Stratagene Mx3005P instrument 
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) with the following thermal 
settings: 1 cycle of 10 sec at 95˚C and 45 cycles of 5 sec at 95˚C 
and 20 sec at 60˚C. According to the method tested by Tichopad, 
the relative expression ratio (RR) of the POSTN was calculated 
based on amplication efficiencies and the cycle threshold 
comparative with a reference gene (GAPDH) in a sample.
Immunohistochemistry. Six paraffin sections of tumor were 
selected for analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was 
performed on 4‑µm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue 
sections. The slides were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated 
in a graded ethanol series. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked 
with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. The primary antibody 
that was used was the rabbit polyclonal anti-periostin antibody 
(ab14041, 1:200; Abcam). Immunohistochemical staining was 
performed using the Envision™ two-step Visualization System 
(Envision Detection kit GK500705, Peroxidase/DAB, rabbit/
mouse; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The next steps 
were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was performed 
using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Values are 
presented as the mean ± SEM. The significant differences 
between the tumor, tumor adjacent and surrounding tissues 
were assessed by the paired samples t-test. The correlation 
between periostin gene expression and the clinicopathological 
characteristics of the NSCLC patients was analyzed by the 
independent samples t-test. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to generate survival curves, and survival differences were 
analyzed with the log-rank test, based on the status of periostin 
expression. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed 
using Cox's proportional hazards regression model. P<0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Expression of periostin mRNA and protein in each tissue. At 
the mRNA level, the difference between the expression in the 
cancer tissue and normal tissue was not significant (Table II). 
The western blot analysis showed that the periostin level was 
elevated in the cancer tissue of the NSCLC patients (Fig. 1). 
The periostin protein gray scale levels of cancer, paratumor 
and normal tissues were 1.810±0.415, 0.857±0.130 and 
0.808±0.100, respectively (Table II and Fig. 2). The protein 
level of periostin in the cancer tissues was significantly higher 
than in the paratumor (P=0.000) and normal (P=0.017) tissues.

However, there were no differences between the paratumor 
tissues and normal tissues (P=0.978). Periostin expression was 
also analyzed in 6 benign lung tumors (including 3 inflamma￾tory pseudotumors and 3 pulmonary tuberculosis), and higher 
expression was observed at the protein level in the pseudotu￾mors and tuberculosis than in the adjacent and surrounding 
tissues (Table III; P<0.05). In addition, there was no prominent 
difference between the NSCLC patients and the benign lung 
tumor patients (data not shown).
Correlation between periostin expression and the clini￾copathological characteristics of NSCLC patients. The 
correlation between periostin expression and the clinicopatho￾logical characteristics of the NSCLC patients was analyzed, 
and the result is shown in Table IV. As indicated in this table, 
the expression of periostin had no correlation with age, patho￾logical type, TNM stage, lymph node status, smoking history, 
tumor size or invasiveness. Periostin gene expression (at the 
mRNA and protein level) was shown to correlate with the 
gender of the NSCLC patients; the value of the mRNA and the 
gray scale level of protein in the male group was 1.438±0.427 
and 3.915±0.663, respectively, while those of the female group 
were 0.449±0.117 and 1.463±0.202, respectively. Statistical 
significance was determined by the independent samples t-test 
(Table IV; P<0.05).
Locating periostin in NSCLC by immunohistochemistry. To 
investigate the location of periostin in NSCLC, immunohis￾tochemistry was carried out on 3 ADC slides and 3 squamous 
carcinoma slides. The immunostaining indicated that high 
levels of periostin were present in the mesenchymal areas, 
but not in the cancer cells themselves. Certain samples were 
highly stained and others demonstrated no staining (Fig. 3).
Prognostic significance of periostin expression. A 
Kaplan‑Meier analysis indicated that the NSCLC patients 
whose tumors showed high levels of periostin expression 
(periostin-H) had significantly shorter overall survival times
compared with those with low levels of periostin expres￾sion (periostin-L; P=0.036, log‑rank test; Fig. 4). The 3-year 
survival rate was 81.5% for patients with periostin-L (n=27), 
and 45.4% for patients with periostin‑H (n=22). A univariate 
analysis was also performed to evaluate the associations 
between patient prognosis and other factors, including age 
(<60 vs. ≥60 years), gender (male vs. female), pT status 
(T1 vs. T2-4), pathological node (pN) status (N0 vs. N1 
and N2), histological type (ADC vs. non-ADC), smoking 
history (smoker vs. never-smoker) and periostin expression 
(periostin‑H vs. periostin-L). Among these parameters, 
advanced pN status (P=0.044) and periostin status (P=0.044) 
were significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Since

the variables shown to have prognostic affects by univariate 
analysis may represent covariates, all significant variables 
from the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate 
regression analysis in order to identify independent prognostic 
factors. The resulting data are presented in Table V. Periostin 
expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor 
(P=0.011).
Discussion
Periostin is homologous with fasciclin I, a protein expressed 
on the surface of a subset of axon pathways in the embryonic 
central nervous system in insects. Fasciclin I supports cell 
aggregation and mediates cell sorting, and disruption of 
fasciclin I causes defects in axonogenesis (19). In mammals, 
another novel protein that has a similar structure is βig-h3, 
which was originally cloned as a molecule induced by TGF-β.
βig-h3 promotes adhesion and spreading of fibroblasts in vitro, 
and may be associated with microfibrils in vivo. Periostin is 
also a TGF-β-induced extracellular matrix protein involved in 
cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis (20).
Periostin is overexpressed in the tumor tissue of a number 
of human tumors, and a similar result is shown in the serum of 
lung cancer (16) and thymoma (21) patients. The mechanism by 
which periostin interacts with tumors has not been completely

elucidated. The majority of analyses have shown that peri￾ostin stimulated tumor growth by connecting with integrins, 
particularly αvβ3, αvβ5 and α6β4. Zhu et al demonstrated 
that recombinant periostin promoted adhesion and migration 
of epithelial ovarian tumor cells, and that this function was 
inhibited by the αvβ3 or αvβ5 antibody, indicating that periostin

is important in the αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrin‑dependent adhesion 
and migration of epithelial cells (5). Further studies showed that 
periostin is the ligand of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins in breast (11), 
colon (12) and oral (22) cancer cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, 
the α6β4-integrin complex acts as the cell receptor of periostin, 
and this interaction promotes migration through phosphoryla￾tion of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (AKT) 
through activation of the PI3 kinase pathway (15). In a previous 
study, we demonstrated that periostin promotes the proliferation 
and migration of the human lung ADC cell line (A549) in vitro
by the EMT pathway (18). Malanchi et al (23) showed that 
periostin was required for cancer stem cell maintenance and 
that blocking its function prevents metastasis. Periostin recruits 
Wnt ligands and thereby increases Wnt signaling in cancer stem 
cells.
In the present study, periostin expression was detected 
in the tumor, paratumor and normal tissues, and the clinical 
significance of periostin in the progression and development of 
NSCLC was observed. The genome was not exactly the same 
in the paratumor tissue and precancerous lesions, but they 
were almost identical in histomorphology. When the changes 
in molecular biology and gene map in the process of tumor 
progression and development were discussed, the paratumor 
was selected, and the relative normal tissue from the same 
patient acted as the control.
Periostin protein levels of the tumor, paratumor and normal 
tissues of 49 NSCLC patients were detected in the present 
study. It was demonstrated that the protein level of periostin was 
much higher in the tumor tissue than in the other 2 groups, but 
that there was no difference between the paratumor and normal 
tissues. These findings are similar to the majority of other types 
of epithelial cancer, including breast (11) and colon (12) cancer. 
There was no difference between the paratumor and normal 
tissues at the protein level, therefore periostin was analyzed in 
the tumor and normal tissue at the mRNA level. However, there 
was no significant difference between the tumor and normal 
tissues at the mRNA level. It is well known that mRNA reflects 
the transcriptional level and protein reflects the translocational 
level. In the present study, the mRNA level was not consis￾tent with the protein level. The ribosome‑loading regulation 
system and miRNA are likely to play an important role in the 
translocation of the periostin gene. There are several levels of 
regulation from transcription to translocation, and mRNAs 
either degrade or stop translocation in the process. The protein 
level of periostin is notable with regard to illustrating the func￾tion of the gene. Periostin is a novel molecule in the progression 
and development of NSCLC.
In the present study, the level of periostin was higher in the 
tumors from the male and non-ADC groups. These findings 
are also supported by the study of Soltermann et al (24), which 
showed that the high expression of periostin in either the 
stroma or tumor epithelia was detected in NSCLC tissues by 
immunohistochemistry, particularly in the male study group. 
The majority of non-ADC tumors in this study were squamous 
carcinomas. It is well known that lung squamous cell carci￾noma is a male-dominated cancer. Puglisi et al (25) showed 
that periostin was significantly correlated with the expression 
of the estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer, 
thus providing a reason why periostin is overexpressed in male 
and squamous cell carcinoma. However, tobacco smoking may 
be the most important reason behind this. In the present data, 
the periostin expression of the patients who had a smoking 
history (4.350±0.927) was higher than those who did not smoke 
(2.319±0.446), although there was no statistically significant 
difference. Tobacco produces >4,000 chemical substances, 
and 1/80 of them are carcinogenic. Studies have indicated that 
the polycyclin aromatic and nitroso compounds in the smoke 
damage the bronchial epithelial cell DNA through a variety 
of mechanisms, and activate oncogenes (Ras) and deactivate 
anti-oncogenes (p53). The bronchial epithelial cells transform 
into cancer cells via this process (26,27). Periostin may be a 
promoter in this process.
In the present study, periostin was highly expressed in 
the chronic inflammation patients. It is well known that 
chronic inflammation may act as tumor promoter. Examples 
of this may be seen in studies of MALT lymphoma (28) and 
intestinal carcinogenesis (29). In the present study, there is 
no direct evidence to reveal the correlation between chronic 
inflammation and NSCLC. A group of proteins, known as 
the matricellular proteins, which include thrombospondin 
(TSP-1 and TSP-2), SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich 
in cysteine), osteopontin (OPN), the tenascins (TN-C and 
TN-X) and the CCN family members (CCN1-6), are known 
to be expressed at lower levels in normal adult tissue, but are 
upregulated during wound healing and tissue remodeling. The 
expression of these proteins is also involved in tumor devel￾opment and progression. In normal situations, these proteins 
are well controlled by various signals. However, in tumors, 
the expression of the matricellular proteins is defined in a 
deregulated manner as a ‘wound that does not heal’ (30). In 
the present study, periostin was upregulated in the NSCLC and 
chronic inflammation patients, therefore we hypothesize that 
periostin may be a member of the matricellular protein family 
and that it has an effect on chronic inflammation and cancer. 
Periostin may be a suitable target to block the dangerous loop 
between cancer and inflammation.
Using immunohistochemistry, the present study showed 
that periostin was only located in the mesenchymal tissue 
surrounding the tumor cells. This corresponded to the loca￾tion of periostin previously identified in other types of cancer 
cells (5,6,11,12). In the present study, the pattern of the local￾ization of periostin in the tumoral stroma appears typically 
fibrillar and branched, suggesting a possible association 
between periostin and the fibers of the desmoplastic stroma 
of NSCLC. Recently, immunoelectron microscopy analyses of 
mouse periodontal ligaments has revealed a close association 
between periostin and collagen fibers, indicating that a similar 
association may take place in NSCLC tissues (31).
The localization and function of periostin in the juxtatu￾moral stroma exhibits similarities to other secreted proteins, 
such as the CCN family of proteins. The CCN family is a 
group of 6 secreted proteins that are specifically associated 
with the extracellular matrix. Similar to periostin, CNN 
family members are induced by growth factors and cytokines, 
such as TGF-β and endothelin 1, and cellular stress, including 
hypoxia, and are overexpressed in pathological conditions 
that affect connective tissues, including scarring, fibrosis and 
cancer. They also interact with integrins and act as matricel￾lular proteins to mediate cell adhesion, migration, tissue 
repair (32), fibrosis (33), cancer and vascular disease (34).

1602 HONG et al: OVEREXPRESSION OF PERIOSTIN IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER
For the present survival analysis, the 3-year overall survival 
rate for the patients with periostin-L expression was much 
higher than for those with periostin-H expression. Furthermore, 
the multivariate analysis revealed that periostin-H expression 
was an independent prognostic factor. The results indicate that 
periostin is a crucial prognostic factor. These findings lead 
us to believe that the overexpression of periostin is likely to 
represent an important transformation factor associated with a 
more malignant phenotype in NSCLC patients.
In conclusion, although the present study involved only 
49 patients, it may be concluded that periostin is important 
in the progression and development of NSCLC. There was an 
abnormally high expression level of periostin in the NSCLC 
and lung chronic inflammation patients, and the periostin 
expression level was much higher in the male and non-ADC 
groups of NSCLC patients. We considered that periostin may 
be pivotal in the pathogenesis and development of NSCLC, 
and that chronic inflammation may promote cancer develop￾ment using certain molecules, including periostin. It was 
demonstrated that periostin was only located in the juxtatu￾moral stroma of the NSCLC tissues, along with those proteins 
belonging to the CCN family members, which had been shown 
to be integrin-dependent. Patients with high level of periostin 
achieved a significantly inferior outcome, indicating that it is a 
malignant phenotype in NSCLC.
