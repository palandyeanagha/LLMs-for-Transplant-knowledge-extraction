Abstract
Background: The parathyroid calcium receptor determines parathyroid hormone secretion and
the response of parathyroid hormone gene expression to serum Ca2+ in the parathyroid gland.
Serum Ca2+ regulates parathyroid hormone gene expression in vivo post-transcriptionally affecting
parathyroid hormone mRNA stability through the interaction of trans-acting proteins to a defined
cis element in the parathyroid hormone mRNA 3'-untranslated region. These parathyroid hormone
mRNA binding proteins include AUF1 which stabilizes and KSRP which destabilizes the parathyroid
hormone mRNA. There is no parathyroid cell line; therefore, we developed a parathyroid
engineered cell using expression vectors for the full-length human parathyroid hormone gene and
the human calcium receptor.
Results: Co-transfection of the human calcium receptor and the human parathyroid hormone
plasmid into HEK293 cells decreased parathyroid hormone mRNA levels and secreted parathyroid
hormone compared with cells that do not express the calcium receptor. The decreased
parathyroid hormone mRNA correlated with decreased parathyroid hormone mRNA stability in
vitro, which was dependent upon the 3'-UTR cis element. Moreover, parathyroid hormone gene
expression was regulated by Ca2+ and the calcimimetic R568, in cells co-transfected with the
calcium receptor but not in cells without the calcium receptor. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis
in calcium receptor-transfected cells showed increased KSRP-parathyroid hormone mRNA binding
and decreased binding to AUF1. The calcium receptor led to post-translational modifications in
AUF1 as occurs in the parathyroid in vivo after activation of the calcium receptor.
Conclusion: The expression of the calcium receptor is sufficient to confer the regulation of
parathyroid hormone gene expression to these heterologous cells. The calcium receptor decreases
parathyroid hormone gene expression in these engineered cells through the parathyroid hormone
mRNA 3'-UTR cis element and the balanced interactions of the trans-acting factors KSRP and AUF1
with parathyroid hormone mRNA, as in vivo in the parathyroid. This is the first demonstration that
the calcium receptor can regulate parathyroid hormone gene expression in heterologous cells.

Background
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium homeosta￾sis and bone metabolism. Changes in extracellular Ca2+
([Ca2+]o) are sensed by the parathyroid G-protein coupled
calcium receptor (CaR) [1]. The CaR determines the
response of the parathyroid to [Ca2+]o at the levels of PTH
secretion, PTH gene expression and parathyroid cell pro￾liferation [2,3]. Increased [Ca2+]o activates the CaR, result￾ing in a G-protein-dependent activation of PLC, PLA2 and
PLD [4]. This results in decreased PTH secretion and par￾athyroid cell proliferation. Calcimimetics bind transmem￾brane (TM) 6 and TM7 of the CaR to allosterically alter the
conformation of the CaR [5,6]. The calcimimetic R568
decreases PTH secretion, PTH mRNA levels and parathy￾roid cell proliferation [7,8]. Genetic deletion of Gq/11 spe￾cifically in the parathyroid leads to severe
hyperparathyroidism (HPT) [9]. Similarly, CaR-/- mice are
not viable due to the severe HPT [10] and can be rescued
by mating with PTH-/- or GCM2-/- mice, where PTH is
either absent or markedly reduced [11,12]. Therefore, the
CaR and its signal transduction are central to parathyroid
physiology and the maintenance of a normal serum PTH
and intact Ca2+ homeostasis.
Low serum Ca2+ and chronic kidney disease lead to sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism which is characterized by
increased PTH mRNA levels in experimental models [13].
The increased PTH mRNA in vivo is post-transcriptional
and is mediated by the interaction of trans-acting proteins
to a defined cis-acting AU-rich element (ARE) in the PTH
mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) [14-16]. A 26-nucle￾otide sequence within the ARE is conserved among species
and is both necessary and sufficient for protein binding
and the regulation of PTH mRNA stability by dietary cal￾cium or phosphorus depletion [16,17]. AU-rich binding
factor 1 (AUF1) and Upstream of N-ras (Unr) are PTH
mRNA trans-acting proteins that stabilize PTH mRNA
[18,19]. The binding of these proteins to the PTH mRNA
3'-UTR is regulated in the parathyroid by chronic hypoc￾alcemia, hypophosphatemia and experimental kidney
failure as well as by the calcimimetic R568 [7,15,16]. We
have recently identified the decay-promoting protein
KSRP (KH domain splicing regulatory protein) as an addi￾tional PTH mRNA 3'-UTR binding protein that deter￾mines PTH mRNA stability in transfected cells [20]. KSRP￾PTH mRNA interaction is increased in parathyroids from
hypophosphatemic rats, where PTH mRNA is unstable,
and decreased in parathyroids from hypocalcemic and
experimental renal failure rats, where the PTH mRNA is
more stable. The balanced interaction of PTH mRNA with
AUF1 and KSRP determines PTH mRNA half-life and lev￾els and hence serum PTH levels [20].
There is no parathyroid cell line and the signal transduc￾tion pathway whereby [Ca2+]o regulates PTH secretion has
been characterized by using bovine parathyroid cells in
suspension and rat parathyroid organ cultures [21,22].
Parathyroid hormone gene expression and its regulation
in cells in vitro have been studied in primary cultures of
bovine parathyroids [23,24]. HEK293 cells transfected
with the CaR faithfully maintain an intact signal transduc￾tion after the stimulus of a high [Ca2+]o to activate the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
[25,26]. We have now utilized this transfected heterolo￾gous cell system to study the mechanisms whereby the
CaR regulates PTH gene expression. As the regulation of
PTH gene expression by [Ca2+]o is predominantly post￾transcriptional, we studied PTH mRNA stability in a sys￾tem that was independent of any effect on PTH transcrip￾tion through the PTH promoter. To do this we expressed
PTH mRNA driven by a viral promoter to express large
amounts of PTH mRNA in HEK293 cells. Differences in
PTH mRNA levels would therefore represent only post￾transcriptional regulation. Expression of the CaR mark￾edly decreased PTH mRNA levels and stability and con￾ferred responsiveness to [Ca2+]o and the calcimimetic
R568 in these cells. This was mediated by the PTH mRNA
3'-UTR ARE. Moreover, expression of the CaR in the
HEK293 cells led to a shift from the interaction of the PTH
mRNA with the stabilizing protein, AUF1, to the destabi￾lizing protein, KSRP. Furthermore, the expression of CaR
modified AUF1 post-translationally as previously shown
in vivo [7,27]. Therefore, the expression of the CaR in this
heterologous cell system reproduces the signal transduc￾tion that determines PTH gene expression in the parathy￾roid.
Results
The calcium receptor decreases parathyroid hormone 
mRNA levels post-transcriptionally in HEK293 cells
PTH gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally by
Ca2+ and calcimimetics affecting PTH mRNA stability
[7,15]. To focus on the effect of the CaR on PTH mRNA
stability in a cell system we constructed an expression vec￾tor containing the full-length human PTH gene including
its three exons and two introns (hPTH) driven by a viral
SV40 (not shown) or CMV promoter (Figure 1A). Expres￾sion of PTH from both viral promoters gave similar results
and we used the CMV promoter for further studies.
The hPTH expression plasmid was transiently transfected
into HEK293 cells. The transcribed PTH mRNA was cor￾rectly spliced resulting in PTH mRNA of the expected size
(Figure 1D). The PTH mRNA was translated into mature
human PTH that was measured in the medium by radio￾immunoassay (Figure 1F). We then studied the effect of
the CaR on PTH mRNA levels in HEK293 cells expressing
the PTH gene by transient transfection. The expression of
the CaR was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on
whole cells using an intact cell enzyme-linked immu-

noassay to determine cell surface expression [28] (Figure
1B) and by western blot (Figure 1C). Transfection effi￾ciency was >95%, as indicated by fluorescent microscopy
of the cells co-transfected with a green fluorescent protein
(GFP) expression plasmid (not shown). Co-transfection
of the human (h) CaR together with the hPTH plasmid
resulted in a marked decrease in PTH mRNA levels by
Northern blot (Figure 1D) and real time RT PCR (qPCR)
(Figure 1E) corrected for co-transfected control genes GH
(Figure 1E) or endogenous HPRT (Figure 1G). The
decrease in PTH mRNA by the CaR was reflected in a
decrease in secreted PTH at 48 h (Figure 1F). Transfection
with another G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the PTH
receptor (PTH1R) had no effect on PTH mRNA levels,
confirming the specificity of the CaR effect on PTH mRNA
(Figure 1G).
The calcium receptor decreases parathyroid hormone 
mRNA levels through the parathyroid hormone mRNA 3'-
UTR AU-rich element
We have previously reported that the regulation of PTH
mRNA levels is dependent upon a cis-acting instability
ARE in the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR [15,16,20]. We then deter￾mined if the regulation of PTH mRNA levels by the CaR is
exerted through the PTH mRNA ARE, using a growth hor￾mone (GH) reporter gene containing either the rat PTH 63
nt ARE (GH63) or a truncated non-functional PTH mRNA
40 nt element [29]. Over-expression of the CaR decreased
GH63 mRNA levels but had no effect on wild-type GH
mRNA levels or on a GH mRNA with the truncated 40 nt
PTH mRNA ARE (Figure 2A). Our results indicate that the
CaR specifically decreases PTH mRNA levels through the
PTH mRNA ARE.
To study the effect of the CaR on PTH mRNA stability we
used an in vitro degradation assay (IVDA) [16,20]. A radi￾olabeled polyadenylated in vitro-transcribed hPTH mRNA
was incubated with extracts from cells transfected with
either the CaR expression plasmid or a control plasmid.
The amount of intact PTH mRNA remaining with time
represents the decay of the transcript by the different
extracts and is indicative of the decay rate in vivo [15,30].
The rate of PTH mRNA decay was increased by extracts
from cells expressing the CaR compared with extracts
from cells with control plasmid correlating with PTH
mRNA levels in the transfected cells (Figure 2B, top gel
and Figure 2C). We then performed IVDA using polyade￾nylated PTH mRNA with an internal deletion of the ARE
(Figure 2B, bottom gel and Figure 2C). The PTH mRNA
transcript lacking the ARE was stable throughout the
experiment and in contrast to the full-length PTH mRNA,
was not affected by expression of the CaR (Figure 2B and
2C). Our results indicate that the CaR specifically
decreases steady-state PTH mRNA levels and PTH mRNA
stability through the PTH mRNA ARE.
Protein-PTH mRNA interactions by RNA 
immunoprecipitation assays
In vivo in the rat parathyroid, PTH mRNA stability is deter￾mined by the regulated binding of AUF1 and KSRP to the
PTH mRNA 3'-UTR [20]. To identify protein-mRNA inter￾actions in the CaR transfected cells, we performed RNA
immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays using extracts from
HEK293 cells transfected with the CaR or control plas￾mids. Immunoprecipitation was performed with antibod￾ies to AUF1, KSRP or control IgG followed by qRT PCR of
the recovered RNA and input extracts. Parathyroid hor￾mone mRNA was decreased in the CaR expressing extracts
compared with control extracts (Figure 3A) as above (Fig￾ure 1D, 1E and 1G). The RIP assay showed that the
amount of PTH mRNA bound to AUF1 was decreased in
CaR-expressing cells compared with control cells (Figure
3B). In contrast, PTH mRNA bound to KSRP was increased
in the CaR-expressing cells (Figure 3C). This binding pat￾tern is consistent with the stabilizing function of AUF1
and the destabilizing function of KSRP on PTH mRNA
[18,20]. The increased binding to KSRP and the decreased

binding to AUF1 correlate with the lower levels of PTH
mRNA induced by the CaR in the transfected cells.
The calcium receptor leads to post-translational 
modification of the parathyroid hormone mRNA binding 
protein AUF1
In vivo dietary-induced hypocalcemia and hypophos￾phatemia as well as adenine-induced renal failure and the
calcimimetic R568 lead to post-translational modifica￾tions of AUF1 as shown by 2D gels [7,27]. To determine
whether the effect of the CaR on PTH mRNA stability in
the engineered cells involves post-translational modifica￾tions of AUF1 as it does in the parathyroid, we performed
2D gels on extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with the
CaR expression plasmid or an empty vector as control.
AUF1 has four isoforms of p37, p40, p42 and p45. There
was no difference in AUF1 protein levels in the 1D gels
between cells with and without the CaR, apart from a
small decrease in p45 in the CaR-expressing cells (Figure
4A). However, 2D gels showed that endogenous AUF1
isoforms p37, p40 and p42 had a different distribution of
the spots between extracts of cells with and without the
CaR (Figure 4B). These results suggest that the CaR
induces post-translational modifications in AUF1 in the
transfected cells.
To analyze the four isoforms of AUF1 separately, we uti￾lized myc-tagged AUF1 expression plasmids. HEK293
cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids
for myc- p37, p40, p42 or p45 isoforms of AUF1 together
with the CaR or control plasmids. Cell extracts were ana￾lyzed on 2D gels with an anti-myc antibody. CaR expres￾sion led to changes in mobility of myc-AUF1 p37, p40
and also p45 but not p42 (Figure 4C). Unlike the changes
in myc-AUF1 p45, endogenous AUF1 p45 was only
slightly modified by CaR signaling. The change in endog￾enous p42 was not reflected in the myc-tagged transfected
p42. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear.
AUF1 p40 undergoes reversible phosphorylation which
may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover [31,32]. We
therefore added a non-specific phosphatase to extracts
from cells expressing myc-p40 with or without the CaR.
Calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) treatment of control
extracts modified AUF1 to the form present in CaR￾expressing extracts (Figure 4D). Treatment with CIP had
no further effect on the CaR-expressing extracts. These
results indicate that the CaR modifies AUF1 post-transla￾tionally and suggests that at least part of this change
involves phosphorylation of isoform p40.
Expression of the CaR in HEK293 cells decreases AUF1 and increases KSRP interaction with the PTH mRNA Figure 3

Parathyroid hormone mRNA levels are regulated by 
[Ca2+]o and the calcimimetic R568 through the calcium 
receptor
We then studied the effect of a low-calcium medium on
the regulation of PTH gene expression by the CaR in the
transfected cells. HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected
with expression plasmids for PTH and the CaR or a con￾trol plasmid were grown in a medium with either 0.2 or
1.2 mM Ca2+. Expression of the CaR decreased PTH
mRNA in cells grown in physiological 1.2 mM Ca2+ con￾centration by both Northern blots and qRT PCR (Figure
5A and 5B) as in Figure 1. Importantly, the low-Ca2+
medium attenuated the decrease in PTH mRNA levels
induced by the CaR (Figure 5A and 5B). There was no
effect of a low-Ca2+ medium in cells that did not express
the CaR.
Calcimimetics are compounds that bind and activate the
CaR [5]. We then performed the same experiments with
and without the calcimimetic, R568 (Figure 4C). The CaR
decreased PTH mRNA levels as before at 1.2 mM Ca2+
(Figure 5C). Activation of the CaR by R568 decreased PTH
mRNA levels at 1.2 mM Ca2+ (Figure 5C) and also at 0.2
mM Ca2+ (Figure 5D). 0.2 mM Ca2+ prevented the

decrease in PTH mRNA levels due to the CaR (Figure 5B
and 5D). However, at 0.2 mM Ca2+ the addition of R568
still effectively decreased PTH mRNA levels (Figure 5D).
There was no effect of CaR expression on co-transfected
GFP mRNA levels (Figure 5D) used as a control for trans￾fection efficiency and loading. There was also no effect of
R568 on PTH mRNA levels in cells co-transfected with the
control plasmid that did not express the CaR (Figure 5C
and 5D). The effect of R568 on PTH mRNA levels in the
CaR-transfected cells at 0.2 mM Ca2+ indicates that the cal￾cimimetic is effective at activating the CaR even when the
CaR is in a relaxed configuration. Therefore, in these engi￾neered cells, the CaR is permissive for the effect of [Ca2+]o
and R568 on PTH mRNA levels.
Discussion
Primary bovine parathyroid cells in culture have been suc￾cessfully used for the study of PTH secretion in the short
term (hours) but not for longer term effects on PTH gene
expression. This is because these primary monolayer cul￾tures of parathyroid cells lose the expression of the CaR
after 24 h in culture [33]. Parathyroid organoid cultures
retain a prolonged calcium response and regulation of
PTH mRNA stability by high [Ca2+]o and a calcimimetic
[34,35]. However, there is no parathyroid cell line. Kifor
et al [25] showed that the CaR activated the phosphotyro￾sine kinase in both CaR-transfected HEK293 cells and
native bovine parathyroid cells. In CaR-expressing
HEK293 cells, [Ca2+]o activates PI-PLC, PLA2 and PLD,
similar to the effect in bovine primary parathyroid cell
cultures [25,26,36]. There have been no studies on the
effect of the CaR on the regulation of PTH gene expression
using the transfected HEK293 cells. We therefore
expressed the CaR together with the hPTH gene in
HEK293 cells. The effect of [Ca2+]o and the calcimimetic
R568 on PTH expression in the parathyroid in vivo is pre￾dominantly post-transcriptional, regulating PTH mRNA
stability and not transcription through the PTH promoter
[7,15]. This allowed us to use a viral promoter upstream
of the hPTH gene to study the effect of the CaR signaling
on PTH mRNA levels. The PTH gene was efficiently tran￾scribed, processed and translated to mature immunoreac￾tive PTH. Significantly, PTH mRNA and secreted PTH
levels were decreased in cells expressing the CaR com￾pared with control cells. The calcium concentration in the
medium was 1.2 mM, which would activate the CaR to
reduce PTH mRNA levels in the CaR-transfected cells.
Therefore, the CaR suppresses PTH gene expression post￾transcriptionally by acting on PTH mRNA driven by a viral
and not the native PTH promoter. In vitro degradation
assays using extracts from cells with or without the CaR
showed that expression of the CaR led to a decrease in
full-length PTH mRNA half-life but not the half-life of a
PTH mRNA with an internal deletion of the PTH mRNA
ARE. The decreased PTH mRNA stability correlated with
decreased PTH mRNA steady state levels.
Dietary-induced changes in serum calcium and phosphate
levels regulate PTH gene expression in vivo post-transcrip￾tionally [14,15]. This regulation is mediated by the
changes in binding of stabilizing trans-acting factors,
AUF1 and Unr, and the destabilizing protein KSRP, to the
defined cis-acting ARE in the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR [16,18-
20]. The role of the PTH mRNA ARE in the regulation of
PTH mRNA levels by the CaR was demonstrated by trans￾fection experiments using a GH reporter mRNA contain￾ing the PTH mRNA 63 nt ARE. The CaR decreased GH￾PTH ARE mRNA levels but had no effect on native GH
mRNA or a GH mRNA containing a truncated PTH mRNA
ARE. Calcium receptor-transfected HEK293 cells showed
increased KSRP-PTH mRNA binding and decreased AUF1-
PTH mRNA binding by RIP analysis, correlating with the
decreased PTH mRNA levels and stability in the CaR￾transfected cells. Therefore, the signaling of the CaR in the
parathyroid is maintained in the transfected cells as
reflected in changes in AUF1 and KSRP PTH mRNA inter￾actions and the role of the PTH mRNA ARE in this regula￾tion.
AUF1-PTH mRNA binding is increased by hypocalcemia
or chronic kidney disease, or decreased by hypophos￾phatemia or administration of the calcimimetic R568
[7,15]. These changes in serum Ca2+ or phosphate and
kidney disease are associated with post-translational
modifications of AUF1. AUF1 isoforms p40 and p42 are
modified by dietary-induced hypocalcemia, and the sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic kidney disease
and its treatment by R568 [7,27]. We now show that
expression of the CaR in the engineered cells also induces
post-translational modifications in both endogenous
AUF1 and myc-tagged transfected AUF1 isoforms that are
similar to the modifications in vivo in the parathyroid. The
modification of at least AUF1 p40 involves phosphoryla￾tion where expression of the CaR is associated with
dephosphorylation. Post-translational modifications of
this isoform, AUF1 p40, are altered concomitant with
changes in RNA binding activity and stabilization of ARE￾containing mRNAs in phorbol ester-treated monocytic
leukemia cells [32]. AUF1 p40 recovered from polysomes
was phosphorylated on Ser83 and Ser87 in untreated cells
but lost these modifications following phorbol ester treat￾ment. It was suggested that selected signal transduction
pathways may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover by
reversible phosphorylation of AUF1 p40 [31,32]. There￾fore, both in the CaR-transfected cells and in the phorbol
ester-treated cells, dephosphorylation of AUF1 p40, is
associated with decreased AUF1 activity. In the case of
PTH mRNA, inactivity of AUF1 results in a less stable PTH

mRNA after expression of the CaR, as AUF1 is a PTH
mRNA stabilizing protein [18,27].
We also show that expression of the CaR conferred
responsiveness to low [Ca2+]o and the calcimimetic R568,
underlining the relevance of this cellular model to the par￾athyroid. A low- [Ca2+]o medium increased PTH expres￾sion only in the cells expressing the CaR. Similarly, R568
decreased PTH expression through the CaR at both 1.2
and 0.2 mM [Ca2+]o. Therefore, regulation of PTH mRNA
levels by expression of the CaR itself and both its activa￾tion by the calcimimetic and its relaxation by a low
[Ca2+]o are maintained in these transfected cells. This is
the first demonstration that the CaR can regulate PTH
gene expression in heterologous cells. This regulation is
obtained through the post-transcriptional mechanisms
that involve changes in PTH mRNA-protein interactions
in the parathyroid (Table 1). It is likely that PTH secretion
would exhibit a similar regulation by calcium as PTH
mRNA levels, given its dependence on the latter. How￾ever, secretion was not measured as a function of the
extracellular calcium concentration in the heterologous
HEK293 cell system, in which there is a prominent com￾ponent of constitutive secretion, unlike the parathyroid
cell [37,38]. Secretion in HEK293 cells may be independ￾ently regulated by the CaR although we have not studied
this question. The parathyroid cell is unique in that the
stimulus for secretion, gene expression and cell prolifera￾tion is a low [Ca2+]o and not a high [Ca2+]o. Inverse con￾trol of secretion by a low [Ca2+]o of PTHrP secretion also
occurs in the epithelial cells of the lactating breast and cer￾tain breast cell lines [39,40]. In addition high [Ca2+]o
decreases hormone secretion in the secretion of renin by
renal juxtaglomerular cells [41]. Calcium receptor activa￾tion increases cell proliferation in cultured cells [42], but
inhibits parathyroid proliferation in vivo [43]. It is remark￾able and intriguing that despite these differences, the
transfected cell system retains so many of the native char￾acteristics of the unique parathyroid cell, specifically the
relationship between calcium and PTH mRNA stability.
The CaR-mediated decrease in PTH expression in these
cells mirrors the marked increase in serum PTH in vivo in
mice and men with inactivating mutations of the CaR
[6,10,36,43,44]. These results support the concept that
the parathyroid cell is geared to constitutively synthesize
and secrete PTH, and it is the presence of a functioning
CaR that tonically inhibits PTH expression and secretion
and allows responsivity to [Ca2+]o.
Conclusion
The expression of the CaR in transfected HEK293 cells
decreases PTH gene expression post-transcriptionally and
is sufficient to confer the regulation of PTH gene expres￾sion by [Ca2+]o and a calcimimetic, R568. The CaR
decreases PTH gene expression in these engineered cells
through the balanced interactions of the trans-acting fac￾tors KSRP and AUF1 with PTH mRNA and the PTH mRNA
ARE, as in vivo in the parathyroid. This is the first demon￾stration that the CaR can regulate PTH gene expression in
heterologous transiently transfected cells.
Methods
Cells and transfection
HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected in a 10 cm
dish with 5 Pg expression plasmids for the PTH gene and
the CaR plasmid or a control plasmid using a Calcium
Phosphate Transfection Kit (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA).
At 48 h the cells expressing the CaR or controls were
detached and replated in 24 well plates and treated as
indicated, in triplicates for 48 h. Cells were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Bio￾logical Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), L-Glutamine (Bio￾Table 1: Regulation of PTH gene expression in HEK293 cells transfected with the CaR and hPTH plasmids and in the rat parathyroid

logical Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) and Pen-Strep
solution (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). Cal￾cium concentration in the medium was 1.2 mM. In some
experiments Ca2+-free DMEM medium was used (0.2 mM
Ca2+) and CaCl2 was added as indicated. R568, a gift from
Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was dissolved in DDW
and added to the medium at a final concentration of 1
PM.
RNA extraction and analysis
RNA extraction was performed using Tri reagent (Molecu￾lar Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA). mRNA con￾centration was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies; Wilming￾ton, DE, USA). For real-time PCR 1 Pg mRNA was used as
template for RT PCR with Maxime RT PreMix (Random
primer) from iNtRON (Gyeonggi-do, Korea). qPCR was
performed using SYBR Green ROX Mix (ABgene, Surrey,
UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions in
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR Systems from Applied Bio￾systems.
The following primers were used: hPTH (5'-gggtctgcagtc￾caattcat-3' and 5'-cagatttcccatccgatttt-3'), hGH (5'-gggag￾gctggaagatggc-3' and 5'-cgttgtgtgagtttgtgtcgaac-3'), hHPRT
(5' tttgaatcatgtttgtgtcattagtga and 5' ttccaaactcaacttgaactct￾catc). For Northern analysis RNA was run on agarose for￾maldehyde gels and blotted using a Hybond-N
membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK).
Membranes were hybridized to fragments for hPTH or
GFP [20,29]. In some experiments ethidium bromide
staining of membranes was used for quantification of 18S
or 28S as loading controls.
Plasmids
For the hPTH expression plasmid, a HpaII fragment
including the three exons and two introns of the hPTH
gene from plasmid pPTHg108 [20] was inserted down￾stream of the CMV promoter in pcDNA3 expression plas￾mid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). The hCaR plasmid
was kindly provided by M Lohse (Wurzburg, Germany),
the GFP pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and
hGH (kindly provided by O Meyuhas, Jerusalem, Israel
[45]) were used as controls. The GH-PTH63 or GH￾tPTH40 expression plasmids contained 63 bp or a trun￾cated 40 bp fragments of the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE that
were inserted between the coding region and the 3'-UTR
of GH mRNA [29]. hPTH1R was provided by MA Levine,
Cleveland, OH, USA). In some experiments cells co-trans￾fected with the GFP plasmid were analyzed by fluorescent
microscopy to estimate transfection efficiency, which was
always >90%.
Immunoreactive parathyroid hormone
Medium was replaced 1 h prior to collection and analyzed
using the Immulite 2000 Intact PTH assay (Los Angeles,
CA, USA)
In Vitro Degradation Assays
Radiolabeled transcripts (200,000 cpm) were incubated
with 40 Pg protein extract from cells in a volume of 50 Pl
and in a reaction buffer containing 3 mM Tris HCl, pH
7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaCl, 10 mM ATP and 30 units
RNasin. At timed intervals samples were removed, RNA
extracted, separated on agarose gels and analyzed by auto￾radiography as described [15].
The following plasmids were used as templates for RNA
transcription: pBluescript II KS plasmid containing either
the full-length rat PTH cDNA (772 bp) or a PTH cDNA
with an internal deletion of the PTH mRNA ARE and a
stretch of ~150 dT nucleotides that by in vitro transcription
produced a poly(A) tail. The plasmids were linearized
with SmaI [20].
2D gel electrophoresis
Analysis was performed as previously described [27].
RNA immunoprecipitation
Transiently transfected cells were grown in a 14 cm dish
for 48 h, collected in ice-cold PBS, pelleted and re-sus￾pended in RIPA buffer (containing 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and pro￾tease inhibitors) supplemented with RNase inhibitors
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and homogenized by
pipetting. Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were
immunoprecipitated with Protein A agarose-bound anti￾KSRP or AUF1 antibody beads (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany) or IgG as control after incubation for 2 hr at
4°C. The beads were then washed with modified RIPA
buffer (supplemented with 1 M NaCl, 1% Sodium Deox￾ycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 2 M urea). RNA was extracted
and analyzed by qPCR for PTH and GH mRNA using
SYBR Green ROX Mix as described above.
Intact cell enzyme-linked immunoassay
The assay was performed as previously described [27]. In
brief: 48 h after transfection cells were detached in PBS
supplemented with BSA and EDTA. The cells were then
pelleted and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with the anti-CaR
antibody followed by PBS wash (× 3) and incubation with
the secondary HRP-conjugated antibody. Cells were then
washed (× 3) prior to adding the HRP substrate and the
fluorescent signal was visualized using an electrochemilu￾minescent reader.
