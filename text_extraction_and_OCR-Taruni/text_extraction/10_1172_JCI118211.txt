Abstract
Lysophosphatidyicholine (lysoPC), a component of athero￾genic lipoproteins and atherosclerotic lesions, has been re￾cently suggested to play a role in atherogenesis. LysoPC
is known to induce several endothelial genes involved in
leukocyte recruitment, mitogenesis, and inflammation.
Cyclooxygenases (prostaglandin H2 synthases) are rate-lim￾iting enzymes involved in the endothelial synthesis of prosta￾cyclin, an antiplatelet, vasorelaxant, and vasoprotective mol￾ecule. We investigated the effect of lysoPC on the endothelial
expression of cyclooxygenases. Our results demonstrate
that, in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells,
lysoPC induces cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and protein levels.
Increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 is accompanied
by the enhancement of both basal- and calcium ionophore
A23187-induced synthesis of prostacyclin. Nuclear runoff
experiments demonstrated an increased rate of transcrip￾tion of the cyclooxygenase-2 gene by lysoPC. In contrast,
lysoPC did not affect the expression of constitutive cyclo￾oxygenase-1. Our results suggest that the induction of endo￾thelial cyclooxygenase-2 by lysoPC may be an important
vasoprotective mechanism that limits progression of athero￾sclerotic lesions and promotes their regression. (J. Clin. In￾vest. 1995. 96:1688-1692.) Key words: nitric oxide * prosta￾cyclin * endothelium * atherosclerosis * low density lipo￾proteins

so far (2-6). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many cell
types. In contrast, expression of COX-2 requires stimulation of
cells with cell-specific extracellular signals such as autacoids,
hormones, growth factors, and cytokines (7, 8). Both isoforms
of COX have been reported to be expressed in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (9-12).
The major prostanoid synthesized by vascular endothelium
is prostacyclin (PGI2) (13) which regulates various physiologi￾cal processes occurring at the interphase between the blood and
vascular wall. Biological actions of prostacylin include inhibi￾tion of platelet aggregation and adhesion, inhibition of vascular
smooth muscle tone and growth, inhibition of leukocyte activa￾tion and adhesion, and reduction of cholesteryl ester accumula￾tion in cells of the vessel wall (14). These biological actions of
prostacyclin and its efficacy in the treatment of complications
of atherosclerosis such as peripheral vascular disease (15, 16)
suggest that prostacylin is an endogenous antiatherogenic mole￾cule.
Several lines of evidence suggest a role for lysophosphati￾dylcholine (lysoPC) in atherogenesis (17). The lysoPC content
of atherosclerotic arteries is severalfold higher than that of nor￾mal vessels (18). After proatherogenic modifications of LDLs,
lysoPC may constitute up to 40% of their total lipid content (19).
LysoPC is an essential component of oxidized proatherogenic
lipoproteins responsible for their chemotactic effect on human
monocytes (20, 21) and mitogenic effect on murine macro￾phages (22). LysoPC induces monocytic cell expression of hep￾arin-binding epidermal growth factor (23). Importantly, lysoPC
causes induction of several endothelial genes expressed in early
atherosclerosis, such as vascular adhesion molecule-i, intercel￾lular adhesion molecule-i, PDGF chains A and B, and heparin￾binding EGF (24, 25).
Surprisingly, we have recently demonstrated that lysoPC
augments the endothelial expression of nitric oxide synthase
type III which is believed to be a key vasoprotective and antiath￾erogenic enzyme (25a). Prostacyclin and nitric oxide have many
complementary or synergistic vasoprotective actions and,
hence, are believed to serve similar biological functions. There￾fore, to determine whether lysoPC is also involved in the regula￾tion of vasoprotective molecules other then nitric oxide, we
investigated the effects of lysoPC on the expression of COX
isoforms in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results
presented in this communication demonstrate that lysoPC in￾duces expression of COX-2 with resultant augmentation of
prostacyclin synthesis.

indicated all the other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO).
Tissue culture. HUVEC were cultured as described previously (26)
in medium 199 containing 20% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Labora￾tories, Logan, UT), 12.5 Mg/ml endothelium cell mitogen (Biomedical
Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA) and 100 ,g/ml heparin. Only sec￾ond and third passage cells were used. 12 h before lysoPC treatment,
cells were transferred to medium 199 containing 5% FBS and no other
additives.
Northern blotting. Total RNA was isolated using Ultraspec (Biotecx
Laboratories, Houston, TX). 15-25 qg of RNA was fractionated on 1%
agarose and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. As
COX-1 probe we used agarose gel-purified full-length COX-1 cDNA
cloned in our laboratory (11). As COX-2 probe we used agarose gel￾purified full-length 1.94-kb COX-2 cDNA which was obtained from Dr.
Timothy Hla (9). Probe labeling, hybridization, and chemiluminescent
detection were performed using components of Genius system (Boeh￾ringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Membranes were hybridized
overnight in 5 x SSC containing 0.02% SDS, 0.1% sarcosyl, and 2%
blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) at 680C. Nonspecifically
bound probe was washed during 45 min of high stringency washes
performed at 60'C in 0.1 x SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Membranes
were stripped by boiling in 0.2 x SSC containing 1% SDS for 15 min
and rehybridized to a digoxigenin-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe. Blots were quantitated using
the Bio Image system (MilliGen, Burlington, MA).
Western blotting. After incubation with lysoPC for indicated time
HUVEC were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in boiling buffer
containing Tris HCl (0.05 M, pH 7.4) and 1% SDS. Protein concentra￾tion in lysates was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Labora￾tories, Richmond, CA). Lysates (15 Mg protein) were electrophoresed
on 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. The COX proteins on the membranes were detected using
rabbit anti-ram seminal vesicles COX-1 polyclonal antibody raised in
our laboratory or rabbit anti-human COX-2 polyclonal antibody specific
for COOH-terminal insert of COX-2 obtained from Dr. P. Marshall
(Ciba-Geigy, NJ) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL).
Nuclear runoff experiments. Isolation of nuclei and synthesis of
labeled RNA were performed according to a standard laboratory proce￾dure (27). HUVEC nuclei (107) were incubated in the presence of 0.25
mCi of [32P]GTP and other unlabeled nucleotides (1 mM) at 26°C in a
vol of 200 IlI for 25 min. Transcribed RNAs were isolated using Ul￾traspec and equal amounts (6-8 x 106 cpm) were hybridized to dena￾tured plasmids (15 Mg) containing cDNAs for COX-1 (in pSG5 vector;
Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), COX-2 (in pVL1393; Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA), and vWF (in Bluescript; Stratagene) and hamster ,f-tubulin
(in pAcUW5 1; Pharmingen) which were immobilized on nitrocellulose
membranes. Conditions for hybridization and washes were identical to
those during Northern blotting.
Prostacyclin synthesis. HUVEC were incubated with lysoPC for 12
h. Afterwards, cells were washed twice in warm (37°C) 10 mM Hepes
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mM CaC12, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KC1,
and 145 mM NaCl and incubated in 10 ml of the same buffer for 20
min. To determine the effect of lysoPC on prostacyclin synthesis by
activated HUVEC, calcium ionophore A23187 (3 MM) was added to
some of the flasks during the last 10 min of incubation. The concentra￾tion of 6-keto PGFIa, a stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, was
measured in cell supernatants by an RIA (28).
Results
In the presence of 5% serum, lysoPC at concentrations of 100
/.tM and below did not affect the viability of HUVEC mono￾layers, as estimated by trypan blue exclusion and cell counting.
HUVEC could be cultured in the presence of lysoPC for at least
up to 80 h without any signs of cytotoxicity. LysoPC at the
concentration of 100 ,M did not significantly affect the levels

of 2.8-kb COX-l mRNA in cultured HUVEC, as determined
by Northern blotting (Fig. 1 A). Densitometric analysis revealed
that lysoPC-induced increases of COX-1 mRNA levels were
< 1.5-fold. In contrast, lysoPC (100 MM) caused a marked time￾dependent induction of - 4-4.5-kb COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1 B).
COX-2 mRNA levels reached a maximum 3 h after the stimula￾tion with lysoPC. Interestingly, in addition to 4-4.5-kb COX￾2 mRNA, our COX-2 probe hybridized to a distinct 2.8-kb
mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Despite a similar size as that of COX-1
mRNA, this 2.8-kb band is unlikely to be a result of cross￾hybridization of our COX-2 probe to COX-1 mRNA because
this mRNA species is not present in unstimulated HUVEC.
Moreover, this 2.8-kb mRNA was clearly inducible by lysoPC
with a time-course identical to that of induction of COX-2. This
suggests that this 2.8-kb mRNA species is related to COX-2.
Western blotting analysis revealed that the induction of
COX-2 mRNA by lysoPC was paralleled by the appearance of
COX-2 protein (Fig. 2). COX-2 protein level reached a peak 3
h after stimulation with lysoPC (100 MM) and remained detect￾able for at least 24 h after stimulation of HUVEC with lysoPC.
The lowest concentration of lysoPC that was able to induce
COX-2 protein expression after 3 h of stimulation with lysoPC
was 50 MM. LysoPC at 30 MM was without effect (n = 2, not
shown). As shown in Fig. 2, the antibody used for detection of
COX-2 did not cross-react with COX- 1. Western blotting analy￾sis of HUVEC lysates using anti-COX-1 antibody revealed the
presence of a 72/74-kD doublet. The higher molecular weight
band was clearly inducible by lysoPC with a time-course similar
to that of induction of COX-2. The lower molecular weight
band did not change after stimulation with lysoPC. These results
raised suspicions as to the isoform specificity of our COX-1
antibody. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2, the COX-1 antibody cross￾reacted with COX-2. Therefore, it is likely that the higher mo￾lecular weight band of the doublet in Fig. 2 A may represent
mainly lysoPC-inducible COX-2 and the lower molecular
weight band of the doublet may represent mainly noninducible
COX-1.
To establish whether induction of COX-2 by lysoPC is due
to the activation of the COX-2 gene we performed nuclear
runoff experiments. As seen in Fig. 3, nuclei isolated from
HUVEC 3 h after stimulation with lysoPC synthesized a sig￾nificantly greater amount of COX-2 mRNA than the control
HUVEC. In contrast, the rate of transcription of the COX-1

did not observe any lysoPC-induced changes in the transcription
rate of vWF (Fig. 3) and f-tubulin or GAPDH genes (data not
shown).
To establish whether induction of COX-2 in HUVEC has the
expected functional consequence for the endothelial synthesis of
prostacyclin, we determined the production of 6-keto-PGFiar, a
stable product of hydrolysis of prostacyclin, by control and
lysoPC-stimulated HUVEC. As shown on Fig. 4, incubation of
HUVEC for 12 h with lysoPC (100 sM) approximately doubled
basal prostacyclin synthesis whereas prostacyclin release in re￾sponse to calcium ionophore A23187 was increased about five￾fold.

thelial cells by lysoPC. In the presence of 5% serum, lysoPC,
at nontoxic concentrations of 50-100 AM, caused a rapid induc￾tion of COX-2 mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, lysoPC
did not affect COX-1 mRNA or protein levels. Interestingly, in
addition to 4-4.5-kb COX-2 mRNA, our COX-2 probe hybrid￾ized to a distinct 2.8-kb mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Despite a similar
size as that of COX-1 mRNA, this 2.8-kb band is unlikely to
be a result of cross-hybridization of our COX-2 probe to COX￾1 mRNA because this mRNA species is not present in unstimu￾lated HUVEC. Moreover, this 2.8-kb mRNA was clearly induc￾ible by lysoPC with a time-course identical to that of induction
of COX-2. This suggests that this 2.8-kb mRNA species is
related to COX-2. As we have not characterized this 2.8-kb
COX-2-related mRNA, its nature remains unknown. We can
speculate, however, that it may be a product of alternative splic￾ing of COX-2 mRNA or a stable product of degradation of 4-
4.5-kb COX-2 mRNA. To the best of our knowledge induction
of 2.8-kb COX-2-related mRNA has not been reported. Thus,
it is possible that this phenomenon is specific for the induction
of COX-2 by lysoPC.
Our nuclear runoff experiments demonstrated that the induc￾tion of COX-2 by lysoPC is due to the activation of COX-2
gene. Consistently, with the lack of effect of lysoPC on COX￾1 mRNA and protein levels, we did not observe any lysoPC￾induced changes of COX-1 transcription rate.
Induction of COX-2 by lysoPC may have profound conse￾quences for the endothelial function, as it resulted in the en￾hanced synthesis of prostacyclin. Our experiments demonstrated
that both the basal as well as calcium ionophore A23187-stimu￾lated synthesis of prostacyclin were increased in HUVEC stimu￾lated with lysoPC. These results, when considered in conjunc￾tion with the evidence for the simultaneous induction of COX-2
expression, implicate that COX-2 plays a pivotal role in lysoPC￾induced enhancement of prostacyclin synthesis.
Although it is well recognized that COX-2 can be induced in
many cell-types, including HUVEC, by cytokines and mitogenic
factors, to our knowledge, induction of COX-2 by a lipid media￾tor such as lysoPC is a novel observation. This finding raises
several intriguing questions regarding the biological signifi￾cance of lysoPC-triggered induction of COX-2 expression, the

mechanisms involved in lysoPC-triggered activation of the
COX-2 gene, and the potential role of lysoPC as an intracellular
messenger.
Our findings of the induction of COX-2 but not of COX-1
in HUVEC by lysoPC are in keeping with current concepts
regarding the roles of cyclooxygenase isoforms in controlling
prostanoid synthesis (7). COX-1 is expressed constitutively in
many cell types, including endothelial cells, whereas expression
of COX-2 requires stimulation of cells with cytokines, mito￾gens, or other cell-specific signals. The COX-1 gene is regulated
by a tight control mechanism whereas the COX-2 gene is highly
inducible. As we have recently demonstrated (29), COX-1 is
rapidly degraded during catalysis and, therefore, has only a
limited capacity to support elevated synthesis of prostanoids in
stimulated endothelial cells. These properties of COX-1 suggest
that it plays a major role in the basal synthesis of prostanoids. In
contrast, rapid induction of COX-2 is required for augmenting
prostanoids synthesis in response to extracellular stimuli.
As outlined in the introduction, lysoPC is believed to play
a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Several biological
actions of lysoPC are consistent with the function of lysoPC
as a proatherogenic molecule (17-25). Surprisingly, we have
recently shown that lysoPC enhances the endothelial expression
of nitric oxide synthase type HI (25a) which is believed to be
an important antiatherogenic and vasoprotective enzyme. As
prostacycin, the major endothelium-derived prostanoid, is a
vasoprotective, antithrombotic, antiplatelet, growth-suppressant
molecule (14), the induction of COX-2 may be considered as
another example of induction by lysoPC of a vasoprotective and
potentially antiatherogenic endothelial gene. However, several
reservations have to be made at this point because the role of
cyclooxygenases and prostanoids in the pathogenesis of athero￾genesis are currently poorly understood (30). Our results are
consistent with observations demonstrating that oxidized LDL
enhance the endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin (31, 32) as
well as COX-2 mRNA levels (33). However, the effects of
atherosclerosis on prostanoid synthesis in humans or experimen￾tal animals have not been conclusively established as increased
(34, 35), biphasic (28) and reduced prostanoid (36) synthesis
have been reported. Similarly, contradictory effects of nonselec￾tive inhibitors of COX on the development of experimental
atherosclerosis have been observed (37-39), and the effects of
isoform-selective COX inhibitors have not been described yet.
We are also unaware of studies investigating cellular distribu￾tion of COX-isoforms in human atherosclerotic lesions or ani￾mal models of atherosclerosis. Importantly, it is also not known
whether lysoPC induces COX-2 in other cellular components of
atherosclerotic lesions such as macrophages or vascular smooth
muscle cells. In contrast to endothelium, induction of COX-2
in these cells may lead to the production of mainly proinflam￾matory prostanoids which may contribute to the vascular dam￾age. These limitations preclude any definitive statement about
the overall role of induction of COX-2 by lysoPC in the athero￾genesis. However, the biological actions of prostacyclin, a major
endothelium-derived prostanoid, support the notion that the en￾dothelial expression of COX-2 is a vasoprotective mechanism.
It can be conceived that the induction of COX-2 by lysoPC is
a back-up mechanism necessary to support elevated synthesis
of vasoprotective prostacyclin by stressed endothelial cells. In
this context, it is important to note that the vasoprotective and
antiatherogenic actions of prostacyclin and nitric oxide signifi￾cantly overlap and sometimes, as in the case of inhibition of
platelet aggregation (40), are synergistic. Therefore, a coordi￾nated induction of endothelial enzymes involved in synthesis
of nitric oxide and prostacyclin will have a more significant
vasoprotective effect than the induction of nitric oxide synthase
type Ill or COX-2 alone. Our findings that lysoPC can induce
vasoprotective endothelial genes may seem to disagree with
a proposed function of lysoPC as a proatherogenic molecule.
However, they can be easily rationalized on grounds of a hy￾pothesis that atherosclerosis begins as a defensive mechanism
in response to injury (41). According to this hypothesis, it makes
perfect sense that vasoprotective mechanisms are part of an
early atherogenic response which is initially designed to serve
its defensive function and then regress.
LysoPC has been shown to induce expression of several
genes such as vascular adhesion molecule-i, intercellular adhe￾sion molecule-i, PDGF chains A and B, heparin-binding EGF,
and nitric oxide synthase-iII (23-25). However, in none of
the cases have the transduction mechanisms that mediate gene
activation by lysoPC been established. Hints as to possible intra￾cellular pathways involved in lysoPC-induced activation of
COX-2 gene may be suggested by biological actions of lysoPC
in endothelial cells. These include stimulation of protein kinase
C activity (42), augmentation of intracellular concentration of
Ca2+ (43), and uncoupling of cell surface receptors from G
proteins (44). It is especially likely that the induction of COX￾2 by lysoPC is at least in part mediated by activation of protein
kinase C because phorbol esters are potent inducers of COX-2
in many cells, including HUVEC (9). However, activation of
COX-2 gene by extracellular signals has been shown to depend
on many other intracellular signaling pathways involving cAMP
(45 ), tyrosine kinases (45, 46), retinoic acid, or platelet activat￾ing factor (47). Therefore, further detailed work is required to
establish transduction mechanism of activation of COX-2 by
lysoPC. Interestingly, significant amounts of lysoPC can be
generated intracellularly upon the action of phospholipase A2
on membrane phosphatidylcholine, the most abundant phospho￾lipid. LysoPC has been recently suggested as an intracellular
mediator of protein kinase C activation after receptor stimula￾tion (48). Therefore, a possibility exists that lysoPC serves as
an intracellular messenger involved in the regulation of gene
expression. In this context, it may be noted that in many cells
induction of COX-2 and phospholipase A2 occur simultaneously
(49, 50).
We conclude that lysoPC induces expression of COX-2 in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells by a transcriptional
mechanism. This results in the enhancement of endothelial syn￾thesis of prostacyclin. These findings strongly support our previ￾ous suggestion that lysoPC may be an important signal molecule
involved in the regulation of expression of vasoprotective endo￾thelial genes.
