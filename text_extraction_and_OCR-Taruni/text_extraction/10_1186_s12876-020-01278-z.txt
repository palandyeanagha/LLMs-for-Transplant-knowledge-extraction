Abstract
Backgrounds: There is a discrepancy between west and east on the relationship between non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to find out the possible reason for this and to
clarify the association between NAFLD and CKD by analyzing two population-based datasets from the US and China.
Methods: Two health examination datasets from China and the US were used. CKD was defined as an estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 or and/or abnormal albuminuria and/or overt proteinuria. Binary
logistic regression was used to examine the association between NAFLD and CKD.
Results: A total of 60,965 participants were analyzed, including 11,844 from the US and 51,229 from China. The
prevalence of NAFLD was 27.12% in the Chinese population and 36.08% in the US population (p < 0.001). The
proportions of CKD and late stage CKD (stages 3–5) were higher in the US population than the Chinese one. NAFLD
was independently associated with an increased risk of CKD in Chinese population, whereas in the US population, the
NAFLD was not an independent risk factor of CKD. In subgroup analyses which excluded late stages CKD (stages 3–5),
the risks of mild renal function decline became consistent: NAFLD was associated with early stages of CKD but not the
late stages of CKD in both populations.
Conclusion: NAFLD increased the risk of early stages of CKD in both Chinese and the US population. The conflicting
results reported by previous studies might result from the different proportion of late stages of CKD.

Backgrounds
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is character￾ized by lipid accumulation in the liver with the absence
of significant alcohol intake or other medical conditions
that cause fatty liver. It is one of the most common
forms of liver diseases with a global prevalence up to
30% in general population [1]. NAFLD is also a multisys￾tem disease, affecting extra-hepatic organs such as kid￾neys [2, 3].
The relationship between NAFLD and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) has attracted much attention recently.
NAFLD and CKD may share common pathogenic mecha￾nisms, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia and obesity, and thus may potentially share
same therapeutic targets [4–7]. Growing evidence suggests
that patients with NAFLD have a higher risk of CKD than
non-NAFLD population [8–12]. NAFLD was responsible
for a higher frequency of simultaneous liver and kidney
transplantation than other liver diseases, and also a higher
rate for renal retransplantation after simultaneous liver
and kidney transplantation [13]. According to previous re￾port, 1/3 of transplant patients who received a NAFLD
donor liver might develop stage 3 CKD within 2 years after
transplantation [14]. These studies highlight the signifi￾cance of NAFLD as a risk for CKD. However, studies from
different regions have drawn controversial conclusions on
the relationship between NAFLD and CKD. For example,
evidence from US population showed no associated be￾tween NAFLD and CKD after adjustment for components
of the metabolic syndrome [15], while a study from Asia
reported a strong independent relationship between
ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD and CKD [16]. A lat￾est meta-analysis also confirmed the ethnic difference be￾tween Asian and European population: the association
between NAFLD and the risk of CKD is stronger in Asian
population while insignificant in European population [9].
The possible reason for these contradictory conclusions
might due to the heterogeneity of the study population
and the different variables being adjusted in each study,
yet this hypothesis has not been clearly elucidated.
In this study, we aimed to analyze the association be￾tween NAFLD and CKD in two nationally representative
datasets from the US and China and try to elucidate the
risk of CKD in NAFLD population from different
countries.
Methods
Participants
This was a cross-sectional study. Two health examin￾ation datasets were analyzed in this study. The US data￾set was retrieved from the Third American National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III), a nationally representative, cross-sectional study
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
of the United States from 1984 to 1994. The dataset of
this study and further information are available at
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm.
The Chinese health examination dataset was retrieved
from Wenzhou Medical Center of Wenzhou People’s
Hospital, China, from January 2010 to December 2010.
Exclusion criteria included the presence of any of the
following: without ultrasonography results, with missing
data, with hepatitis B or C, and participants with exces￾sive alcohol intake. In Chinese datasets, it was defined as
> 140 g/week for men and > 70 g/week for women. In US
datasets, it was defined as two drinks a day. A drink
means a 12-oz beer, a 4-oz glass of wine or an ounce of
liquor, approximately 35 g alcohol.
According to the presence of fatty liver in ultrasonog￾raphy, participants were divided into the NAFLD group
and non-NAFLD group.
Anthropometric and biochemical measurements
The diagnosis of hepatosteatosis was based on ultrason￾ography in both populations. Serum cholesterol, trigly￾ceride, serum creatinine, and uric acid were obtained
from the original datasets. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by the square
of the height (in meters). Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
was calculated as MAP = (systolic pressure + 2 x diastolic
pressure) /3.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calcu￾lated according to the 2009 CKD-EPI eGFR formula
[17]: eGFR = 141 x min(SCr/κ, 1)α x max(SCr /κ, 1) -1.209 × 0.993Age x [1.018 if female] x [1.159 if Black];κ =
0.7 (females) or 0.9 (males); α = − 0.329 (females) or −
0.411 (males), where Scr is serum creatinine concentra￾tion (in mg/dL) and age refers to age in years.
CKD was defined as either decreased eGFR (< 60 ml/
min/1.732
) and/or abnormal albuminuria and/or overt
proteinuria, in accordance with the Kidney Disease: Im￾proving Global Outcome (KIDGO) 2012 Practice guide￾line for CKD [18].
CKD was classified into five stages based on the eGFR
categories. Decline in GFR category represented CKD
stage G1 to G5 (≥90 [G1], 60–89 [G2], 59–30 [G3], 15–
29 [G4], < 15 [G5] ml/min/ 1.73 m2
). The early stages of
CKD were defined as CKD stage G1-G2, while the late
stages of CKD were defined as stages 3–5.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were represented as mean ± stand￾ard deviation and compared using the Student’s t-test.
Categorical variables were expressed as counts (percent￾ages) and compared using the Chi-squared test or the
Fisher’s exact test when the samples were limited in
number. Binary logistic regressions including two
models (Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, BMI. Model 2
Zhang et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2020) 20:139 Page 2 of 7

adjusted for age, sex, BMI, history of diabetes and his￾tory of hypertension) were employed to find the rela￾tionship between renal function decline and the
presence of NAFLD after correcting for different con￾founding factors of renal function. All tests were two￾sided, and a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. All analysis was conducted by SPSS version
23.0.
Results
Characteristics of participants
A total of 65,085 participants were included in this study
(Fig. 1), with 11,844 from the NHANES III dataset (the
US population) and 51,229 from the Chinese dataset
(the Chinese population). The characteristics of all par￾ticipants are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The difference in
the age between two populations was statistically signifi￾cant but less clinically significant (43.49 ± 14.30 vs.
43.86 ± 16.08, p = 0.023). Compared with the US popula￾tion, the Chinese population was more likely to be male
(59.70% vs. 39.48%, p = 0.019), had lower BMI levels
(23.08 ± 3.31 vs. 27.47 ± 5.98, p < 0.001) and lower pro￾portions of diabetes (6.9% vs. 7.6%, p < 0.001) or hyper￾tension (21.8% vs. 25.5%, p < 0.001).
The prevalence of NAFLD was 27.12% in the Chinese
population and 36.08% in the US population (p < 0.001).
The NAFLD group had significantly higher age, BMI,
blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, and
triglyceride level than the non-NAFLD group in both
populations. The Chinese population had a higher eGFR
level than the US population (91.48 ± 17.06 vs. 80.15 ±
18.65, p < 0.001). Moreover, the proportion of CKD, es￾pecially the proportion of CKD stage 3–5, was lower in
the Chinese participants than the US participants (for
CKD: 9.1% vs.21.5%; for CKD stage 3–5: 4.0% vs.13.5%,
both p < 0.001).
Renal function and NAFLD in different populations
As shown in Table 3, CKD was more prevalent in the
NAFLD group than the non-NAFLD group in both pop￾ulations (Chinese population: 12.3% vs. 8.0%, US popula￾tion: 25.8% vs. 19.0%, both p < 0.001). However, there
were some differences in renal function between these
two groups in different populations. The mean serum
creatinine levels were not statistically different between
NAFLD group and non-NAFLD group in the US popu￾lation (93.35 ± 25.88 vs. 93.62 ± 30.90, p = 0.636) while
the eGFR were significantly lower in NAFLD group
(78.45 ± 18.78 vs. 81.10 ± 18.51, p < 0.001) in the US
population. In Chinese population, both the serum cre￾atinine and eGFR showed statistically different between
two groups. As for the CKD with different stages, late
stages CKD (stages 3–5) consisted of 2/3 of CKD pa￾tients in the US population while less than half of CKD
patients were in stages 3–5 among Chinese population.

Associations between NAFLD and different stages of CKD
Table 4 shows the risk for CKD in NAFLD patients in
different populations. In univariate logistic regression,
NAFLD was significantly associated with CKD in both
Chinese and US adults. In Chinese population, the
NAFLD increased the risk of CKD but the strength of
this affect attenuated with more confounding factors be￾ing adjusted: after adjusted for age, sex, BMI and histor￾ies of hypertension and diabetes, the OR dropped from
1.627 to 1.101. In the US population, the association be￾tween NAFLD and CKD was insignificant after adjusting
for the same confounding factors (P > 0.05).
To explore the possible explanation for this discrep￾ancy between two countries, we performed a subgroup
analysis by stratifying cases by the severity of CKD. As
shown in Table 3, the US population had higher propor￾tion of late stages CKD (CKD stages 3–5), so firstly, we
evaluated the risk for late stages of CKD. The results
showed that NAFLD was not significantly associated
with late stage CKD in both Chinese population and the
US population after adjustment for same metabolic fac￾tors (all P > 0.05). Then we excluded those with late
stages CKD and calculated the risk of early stages of
CKD in NAFLD patients. As shown in Table 4, NAFLD
was an independent risk for early renal function decline
in both populations after adjustment (OR 1.346–1.513 in
Chinese population and 1.160–1.284 in US population,
all P < 0.05).
Discussion
NAFLD and CKD share similar pathological mecha￾nisms; therefore they are speculated to have some links.
This cross-sectional study analyzed the association be￾tween ultrasound-defined NAFLD and CKD in two
health examination datasets from the US and China.
The results of this study confirmed the higher preva￾lence of CKD among patients with NAFLD. Slightly dif￾ference was found between Chinese and US population
in this study: in the Chinese population, NAFLD was
significantly associated with increased risk of CKD after

adjustment for metabolic factors, but in the US popula￾tion, no significant association was found after adjust￾ment for the same factors. However, when we excluded
patients with advanced reduced renal function (eGFR<
60 ml/min/ 1.73 m2
, CKD stages 3–5), NAFLD was sig￾nificantly correlated with increased risk for early renal
function decline in both populations.
The discrepancy between eastern and western popula￾tion regarding the relationship between NAFLD and
CKD has already been found by previous studies. Sirota
et al. [15] found that NAFLD is not associated with the
prevalence of CKD among US adults after adjusting for
features of metabolic syndrome. While other studies
from Asia reported a strong independent risk of CKD in
ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD patients [16, 19, 20].
The meta-analysis also confirmed the difference between
Asian and European populations [9]. The reason for this
discrepancy has not been clarified since all the studies
were not analyzed under same statistical condition. In
this study, in order to compare the association of
NAFLD and CKD in different populations, we creatively
calculated the risks for CKD by adjustment for same
confounders in different datasets. Consistent with previ￾ous studies, we confirmed the ethnic difference in the
relationship between CKD and NAFLD in two
population-based datasets.
The answer for the ethnic difference on the relation￾ship between NAFLD and CKD might result from differ￾ent proportion of severe renal dysfunction. The US
population had a higher percentage of stages 3–5 CKD
than the Chinese population. In fact, after we excluded
those with late stages of CKD, NAFLD was strongly as￾sociated with early renal decline in both populations.
Supporting our results, several prospective studies con￾firmed the influence of NALFD on the development of
CKD, most of which were developed from the early
stages [21–23]. But an important fact we should
emphasize is that, compared with the early stage of
CKD, the later stage of CKD is more complicated and
severe. For example, increased synthesis and decreased
clearance of triglycerides, extremely altered glucose
homeostasis and uncontrollable blood pressure are more
common among patients with late stages CKD [24–26].
Thus NAFLD might have an impact on renal function,

yet it alone apparently not strong enough to contribute
to the late stage function decline when severe renal de￾cline is concerned. That explains why the association be￾tween late stages of CKD and NAFLD is not significant
in both populations. When there are more late stages of
CKD, such as the US population, the relationship of
NALFD and CKD might attenuate during multivariate
analysis.
To our best knowledge, this study is the first to compare
the association between NAFLD and early renal function
decline across different ethnicities. And we also answer
the questions of conflicting conclusion from different
countries from some aspects. The results of our study sug￾gest that NAFLD plays a more important role in mild
renal dysfunction, which providing more evidences for the
hypothesis that pre-existing NAFLD is an independent
risk factor for the development of renal injury.
There are several limitations in this study that deserve
a mention. Firstly, the diagnosis of CKD usually requires
the presence of an abnormality of kidney function or
kidney structure for more than 3 months; however, it is
difficult to perform a second examination in such a large
population in a population-based study. We had to
admit that the diagnostic criteria used in this study,
which has also been used by several similar researches
[15, 27, 28], might overestimate the prevalence of CKD.
Given the cross-sectional design of this study, we are un￾able to draw conclusions about the causality of the rela￾tionship between NAFLD and early renal function
decline. Secondly, we have not use cystatin C to define
eGFR, which is less affected than creatinine by muscle
mass and more accurate for different ethnicities. Thirdly,
there is a huge difference in period of database between
the US (1984–1994) and Chinese (2010) populations,
therefore, the discrepancy in the diet and lifestyle might
be a major concern. It is widely accepted that patients
with CKD should limit the intake of certain foods to re￾duce the accumulation of unexcreted metabolic products
and also to protect against hypertension, proteinuria and
other health problems. In fact, the diet and lifestyle in
China are closer to that in western country since
twenty-first century. According to a previous report,
China’s food consumption patterns and dietary behav￾iors changed dramatically between 1991 and 2011. The
diet has shifted from macronutrient composition toward
fats, and protein and sodium intakes [29]. Another study
also demonstrated that the structure of the Chinese diet
has been shifting away from the traditional diet toward
high-fat, low-carbohydrate and low-fiber diets, and nu￾trients intakes in Chinese people have been changing
even worse than those in American people [30]. There￾fore, the heterogeneous database might partially influ￾ence the results, but the impact is not as larger as
expected.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrated a significant positive associ￾ation between the presence of NAFLD and early stage of
CKD in both the US and Chinese adults. For the late
stages of CKD, NAFLD might not be strong enough to
be an independent contributor.
