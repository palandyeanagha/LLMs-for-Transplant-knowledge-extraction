Abstract
We have recently reported that interferon gamma receptor deficient (IFNcR2/2) allogeneic donor T cells result in
significantly less graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) than wild-type (WT) T cells, while maintaining an anti-leukemia or graft￾versus-leukemia (GvL) effect after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We demonstrated that
IFNcR signaling regulates alloreactive T cell trafficking to GvHD target organs through expression of the chemokine receptor
CXCR3 in alloreactive T cells. Since IFNcR signaling is mediated via JAK1/JAK2, we tested the effect of JAK1/JAK2 inhibition
on GvHD. While we demonstrated that pharmacologic blockade of JAK1/JAK2 in WT T cells using the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor,
INCB018424 (Ruxolitinib), resulted in a similar effect to IFNcR2/2 T cells both in vitro (reduction of CXCR3 expression in T
cells) and in vivo (mitigation of GvHD after allo-HSCT), it remains to be determined if in vivo administration of INCB018424
will result in preservation of GvL while reducing GvHD. Here, we report that INCB018424 reduces GvHD and preserves the
beneficial GvL effect in two different murine MHC-mismatched allo-HSCT models and using two different murine leukemia
models (lymphoid leukemia and myeloid leukemia). In addition, prolonged administration of INCB018424 further improves
survival after allo-HSCT and is superior to other JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, such as TG101348 or AZD1480. These data suggest
that pharmacologic inhibition of JAK1/JAK2 might be a promising therapeutic approach to achieve the beneficial anti￾leukemia effect and overcome HLA-barriers in allo-HSCT. It might also be exploited in other diseases besides GvHD, such as
organ transplant rejection, chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases.

Introduction
Allo-HSCT is often the most effective and curative treatment
for patients with hematologic malignancies such as relapsed or
refractory leukemia and marrow failure states such as myelodys￾plastic syndromes (MDS), myelofibrosis, and aplastic anemia [1].
The therapeutic benefits of allo-HSCT are primarily derived from
an anti-leukemia effect (graft-versus-leukemia effect or GvL) that is
mediated by mature donor T cells present in the donor graft.
Unfortunately, these donor T cells also induce GvHD, the major
life-threatening complication of allo-HSCT [2]. Thus, the clinical
goal is to minimize GvHD without abrogating the beneficial GvL
effect.
The current treatment of GvHD involves the reduction of T cell
numbers or function resulting in loss of donor engraftment,
alloreactivity (GvHD), and an anti-leukemia effect (GvL), thereby
potentially undermining of the beneficial effects of allo-HSCT
leading to enhanced leukemia relapse. Managing the threat of
GvHD while maximizing the beneficial GvL effect would broaden
the scope and usefulness of allo-HSCT procedures and mitigate
the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
hematologic malignancies undergoing allo-HSCT. The develop￾ment of simple and innovative pharmacologic approaches to
modulate alloreactive donor T cell trafficking to GvHD target
organs without affecting T cell trafficking to leukemia cells in vivo
represents a significant advance in allo-HSCT prophylaxis.
Recently, we reported that IFNcR is upregulated in activated T
cells and that IFNcR2/2 allogeneic donor T cells result in
significantly less GvHD than WT T cells, while preserving GvL
with normal allo-reactivity. In addition, we demonstrated that
IFNcR signaling is essential for a chemokine receptor, CXCR3,
expression and T cell trafficking to GvHD target organs [3].
IFNcR signaling is mediated via JAK1 and JAK2. INCB018424 is
a commercially available potent JAK1/JAK2-specific inhibitor
[4,5], that is FDA-approved for advanced myelofibrosis and
currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of other
myeloproliferative disorders [4,5]. We found that this small
molecule inhibitor dramatically reduces the expression of CXCR3
in both human and murine activated T cells [3]. Most
importantly, INCB018424 significantly reduced GvHD and
improved survival after allo-HSCT by modulating allogeneic
donor T cell trafficking to GvHD target organs as seen in
IFNcR2/2 T cells [3]. Based on these data, we hypothesize that

INCB018424 will preserve the beneficial GvL effect while
mitigating GvHD after allo-HSCT.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with current
National Institutes of Health guidelines. The animal care, use, and
euthanasia protocols were approved by the Washington University
School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee (Approval
Number: 20120058).
Mice
All mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME).
Cell culture
Mouse pan T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) were isolated from
mouse spleens using Miltenyi pan T cell isolation kit and an
AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) [6]. The isolated pan
T cells were activated for three days in the presence of anti-CD3/
CD28 antibody-coated beads (bead:cell = 1:1) (Invitrogen, Carls￾bad, CA) in Xcyte media with IL-2 (10 IU/ml) [7].
Flow cytometric analysis
The antibodies used for flow cytometric analyses are as follows.
CD4, CD8, H-2Kb
, CD3, B220, CD45.2, STAT1 (clone: 1/
Stat1), STAT1 (pY701) (clone: 4a) (BD Pharmingen) and CD183
(clone: CXCR3-173) (eBioscience). All data were collected on a
FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and
analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR).
Allo-HSCT
Allo-HSCT was performed as previously described [6,7]. In
brief, 56106 T cell-depleted bone marrow cells (TCD BM)
(CD45.1+ B6 (H-2b
)) and 56105 pan T cells (CD45.2+ B6 (H-2b
))
were injected into lethally irradiated (900–925cGy) Balb/c
recipient mice (H-2d
, CD45.2+). The Balb/c-derived B cell
lymphoma cell line, A20, was used in both systemic leukemia
and solid tumor models. The primary acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) cells, which were harvested from the human
PML-RARa knock-in mice [8], were used in myeloid leukemia
model.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI)
GvL effect assessment and BLI of animals were done as
previously described [6,9]. BLI was performed once every week
starting on day 1 until day 43 post allo-HSCT. Mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 150 mg/g D-luciferin (Biosynth, Naperville,
IL) in PBS, anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, and imaged with a
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera-based BLI system (IVIS
100; Caliper, Hopkinton, MA; exposure time 1–60 seconds,
binning 16, field of view 12, f/stop 1, open filter. Signal was
displayed as photons/sec/cm2
/sr [9].
JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors
INCB018424, TG101348, and AZD1480 were purchased from
Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX) and prepared for injection as
described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
The significance of differences in survival between treatment
groups was analyzed using the log-rank test. For all other analyses,
the unpaired t-test was used.
Results
In vivo administration of INCB018424 preserves a strong
anti-leukemia effect
Since the clinical goal of allo-HSCT is to prevent GvHD
without abrogating GvL, we examined if the in vivo administra￾tion of INCB018424 preserves the beneficial anti-leukemia effect
by performing BLI in two different mouse models of tumor
growth; one a systemic leukemia model (Fig. 1) and the other a
solid tumor lymphoma model (Fig. 1) [3,7]. Using murine T-cell
depleted allo-HSCT model, B6 (H-2b
) R Balb/c (H-2d
) (925 cGy
TBI), with infusion of pan T cells (56105
) (i.v.) and CBRluc￾expressing A20 leukemia cells (Balb/c-derived) either i.v. (systemic
leukemia) or s.c. (solid tumor) at day 0, followed by administration
of INCB018424, we examined the effect of this small molecule
inhibitor on GvL. BLI was performed once every week starting
day 1 until day 43 (Fig. 1A, B).
We found that INCB018424 treatment preserves the potent
anti-leukemia effect in both tumor models (Fig. 1A, B). These
data suggest that pharmacologic modulation of JAK1/JAK2 using
INCB018424 would be a promising therapeutic approach to
overcome HLA-barriers in allo-HSCT.
Prolonged administration of INCB018424 prevents GvHD
and is superior to other JAK inhibitors
As we previously reported, INCB018424 treatment improves
survival by mitigating GvHD after allo-HSCT. Although the
survival after INCB018424 treatment was statistically significant in
that study, the overall survival rate after INCB018424 (40% at day
35 post allo-HSCT) was not as effective as that seen in
IFNcR2/2 T cells (80% at day 35 post allo-HSCT) [3].
Likewise, in the current study, we observed a statistically
significant improvement of survival after allo-HSCT along with
infusion of leukemia cells. However, the overall survivals at day 30
in the systemic leukemia and solid tumor models were 50% (5%
survival in the control group) and 26.7% (0% survival in the
control group), respectively (Fig. 1C). The critical difference
between the previous genetic study and the current pharmacologic
approach is the duration of JAK1/JAK2 activation. While IFNcR￾mediated JAK1/JAK2 signaling in IFNcR2/2 T cells is
presumably inactive (although JAK1 and JAK2 activation
mediated by other signaling pathways might not be affected), the
pharmacologic blockade of JAK1/JAK2 in WT T cells by
INCB018424 was maintained for only three weeks after allo￾HSCT. Thus, we hypothesized that a prolonged administration of
INCB018424 (greater than three weeks in vivo) would result in
improvement in overall survival. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, we
found that the prolonged administration of INCB018424 (for one
month) significantly improved overall survival (75% at day 30 and
50% at day 60) in this fully MHC-mismatched mouse allo-HSCT
model. In addition, this improved survival was similarly observed
in A20 bearing mice when these mice were treated for one month
with INCB018424 (Fig. 2B–C). Furthermore, we observed a
similar immunomodulatory effect of INCB018242 in a different
mouse model (Balb/c to B6) in terms of overall survival (80% -
DMSO vs. 100% - INCB), clinical GvHD score (Fig. 2D), and
weight change (Fig. 2E). Westervelt et al generated an APL
mouse model (B6; H-2b
, CD45.2+) in which the human PML￾RARa gene is inserted into the 59 UTR of the murine cathepsin G

gene [8]. These mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia with 90–
100% penetrance [8]. The leukemia is characterized by marked
peripheral leukocytosis [8]. Banked primary APL cells (56105
cells) obtained from these mice were injected (i.v.) into the lethally
irradiated B6 recipient mice along with TCD BM (56106 cells)
and splenic pan T cells (56106 cells) isolated from Balb/c donor
mice at day 0. Starting at day 16 post transplantation, we
determined leukemic burden of these mice by measuring percent
APL cells in the PB once every week. We found that
administration of INCB018424 preserves GvL activity in this
myeloid leukemia model (Fig. 2F) while significantly reducing
GvHD (Fig. 2G). These data and our previous report [3], in
which altered T cell trafficking was found in another allo-HSCT
model (FVB to Balb/c) after INCB018424 treatment, suggest that
the effect of in vivo blockade of JAK1/JAK2 on GvHD and GvL
might not be model-specific. We also found that INCB018424 is
superior to other JAK inhibitors, such as TG101348 and
AZD1480 (Fig. 2A). Since IFNcR-mediated activation of JAK1
and JAK2 results in phosphorylation of STAT1, we examined if
there are any differences in the ability of these three JAK inhibitors
to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation. We observed that
INCB018424 is the most effective at blocking STAT1 phosphor￾ylation (Fig. 2H). These data suggest that INCB018424 is
superior in inhibiting IFNcR-mediated JAK1/JAK2 signaling
and phosphorylation of STAT1 in vitro and in vivo than the other
JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors tested and may potentially be an ideal drug
to test in the context of GvHD prophylaxis in human allo-HSCT
in the future.
Although we demonstrated that IFNcR signaling can be
modulated by targeting JAK1/JAK2, we cannot exclude the
possibility that JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors have off-target effects,
considering JAK1 and JAK2 function as signal transducers of
multiple cytokine receptors and activation pathways. Thus, we
examined if INCB018424 could further reduce GVHD in the
recipients of IFNcR2/2 T cells. Interestingly, INCB018424
administration resulted in 100% survival (Fig. 2I) and negligible
evidence of clinical GvHD in 90% of the recipients; 1/10 mouse
had grade 2 denuded skin based on the Cooke et al. GvHD
scoring system [10]. These data suggest that INCB018424 may
modulate signaling pathways other than, and in addition to,
JAK1/JAK2. Alternatively, JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors perhaps re￾duce IFNcR signaling in recipients or donor BM-derived antigen
presenting cells (APCs), which may also contribute to reduction of
MHC I and II expression in recipient APCs [11,12].
Discussion
In our previous report, we demonstrated that either genetic
deficiency of IFNcR signaling or pharmacologic inhibition of its
downstream targets JAK1 and JAK2 using INCB018424 results in
less GvHD after allo-HSCT by reducing alloreactive T cell
trafficking to GvHD target organs [3]. In the current study, we
further demonstrate and confirm that the pharmacologic inhibi￾tion of JAK1/JAK2 preserves the beneficial anti-leukemia effect
previously reported by our group in IFNcR2/2 T cells [3] in two
different leukemia models (A20 lymphoid leukemia and APL
myeloid leukemia).
We also show that extending the duration of INCB018424
administration by 10 days (from 21 days in our previous study to
31 days in our current study) [3] significantly reduces GvHD and
improves the overall survival of major MHC-mismatched allo￾HSCT recipients. Spoerl et al. recently reported similar results
[13]. While the overall survivals are comparable between the two
studies (relative survival rates comparing to the BM only groups:
65% - Spoerl et al. vs 58.3% - current study), there are several
differences in the experimental designs of our study and that of
Spoerl et al. First, Spoerl et al used a dose of INCB018424 three
times higher than that used in our current study (Spoerl et al.:
30 mg/kg/day; current study: equivalent to 10 mg/kg/day with
an average body weight of recipient mice, approximately 20 g/
mouse). It is possible that this high dose of INCB018424 resulted
in the reduction of T cell expansion in their BLI study [13] while
our previous study demonstrated that the lower dose of
INCB018424 altered T cell trafficking but did not affect T cell
expansion [3]. Second, Spoerl et al. used only 60% of the T cell
dose used in our study (0.36106 T cells vs. 0.56106 T cells). It is
possible that this modest difference may also contribute to the
observed marginal improved survival reported by Spoerl et al.
Third, the duration of INCB018424 administration was from day -
1 to day +20 by oral gavage in the Spoerl study, while in our study
it was started on day +1 and continued to day +31 by s.c. injection.
There are several possible reasons why INCB018424 might be
more effective at reducing GvHD than TG101348 and AZD1480
in spite of them all being potent JAK inhibitors. Since others have
shown that plasma concentrations of both TG101348 and
AZD1480 are well maintained when administered twice a day
and these drugs are effective in reducing tumor burden in vivo
[14–16], we speculate that the drug efficacy and stability in vivo is
likely not the issue. First, it is conceivable that the preferential
inhibition of JAK2 over JAK1 by TG101348 (35 fold) and
AZD1480 (5 fold), compared to 1.18 fold with INCB018424, may
possibly lead to reduced inhibition of IFNcR signaling (via
STAT1) [16–18]. Therefore TG101348 and AZD1480 may
preferentially inhibit other signaling pathways involving only
JAK2, such as IL-12 (via STAT4), leptin (via STAT3), and IL-3,
IL-5 or GM-CSF (via STAT5) [19]. Indeed, Dey et al
demonstrated that IL-12 is protective against GvHD by inhibiting
activation of alloreactive CD4+ T cells [20]. In addition, it has
been reported that STAT3 signaling is essential for myeloid￾derived suppressor cells [21], which may have an important role in
the suppressing the proliferation of alloreactive T cells [22].
Furthermore, the Blazar group reported that constitutive activa￾tion of STAT5b reduces GvHD [23], suggesting that inhibition of
STAT5 by these compounds could aggravate GvHD. Second, it
has been shown that AZD1480 and TG101348 can reduce the
expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 [24,25], which are ligands of
programed cell death 1 (PD1). Thus, it is possible that reduction of
PD-L1 and PD-L2 on target tissues by AZD1480 might lead to an
increase of alloreactive T cells in GvHD target organs [26,27],
offsetting the reduced T cell trafficking to the GvHD target organs.
Lastly, there might be off-target effects by these drugs which may
be proinflammatory rather than anti-inflammatory.
It has been recently reported that aberrant function of JAK
kinases is found often in AML [28,29], suggesting that JAK1/
JAK2 inhibitors may also induce direct negative regulatory effects
on AML survival and proliferation. If successful in humans, this
strategy (the use of JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors as GvHD prophylaxis
for allo-HSCT) may limit the need for expensive and labor
intensive ex vivo cellular manipulations, such as T cell depletion to
reduce GvHD while maintaining GvL. In addition, this approach
may also result in the reduced use of post-transplant immunosup￾pressive agents which, may themselves, contribute to both
morbidity and mortality after allo-HSCT. Consistent with our
study, Spoerl et al. recently demonstrated that INCB018424 was
able to reduce established GVHD of 6/6 patients treated [13],
suggesting that blockade of JAK1/JAK2 would be an effective
therapeutic strategy for established GvHD as well as a rational
approach as GvHD prophylaxis. Furthermore, pharmacologic

JAK1/JAK2 blockade, either alone or in conjunction with other
methods of GvHD prophylaxis may permit for those patients who
lack a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or
matched unrelated donor (approximately 50% of patients) to
proceed to transplant with limited GvHD and a well preserved
GvL effect. Taken together, our data suggests that JAK1/JAK2 is
a promising therapeutic target to prevent GvHD while maintain￾ing GvL.

0. Clinical GvHD scores according to Cooke et al [10] (C). (D–E) B6 mice were lethally irradiated (1,200 cGy) at day -1 and injected (i.p.) with 50 mg of
anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136). BM cells (56106
) and whole splenocytes (206106
) harvested from Balb/c were transplanted into lethally irradiated B6 at day
0, followed by INCB018424 for 31 days (days +1–+31). Clinical GvHD scores according to Cooke et al [10] (D) and weight change (E). (F–G) B6 mice
were lethally irradiated (1,200 cGy) at day -1 and injected (i.p.) with 50 mg of anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136). TCD BM (56106
) and pan T cells (56106
)
isolated from Balb/c were transplanted into the lethally irradiated B6 at day 0. Banked primary APL cells (56105
) were injected (i.v.) along with TCD
BM and pan T cells at day 0. INCB018424 was administered s.c. twice a day for 31 days (days +1–+31). (F) Percentage of APL cells in the PB was
measured by flow cytometry after staining PB cells starting at day +16 once every week until day +41. Anti-H-2Kb and anti-CD45.2 antibodies were
used to identify the APL cells. H-2b
+ CD45.1+ B6 recipients and H-2d
+ CD45.2+ Balb/c donors were used to discriminate APL from all other cells. (G)
Shown is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. (H) INCB018424 is superior to other JAK inhibitors, such as TG101348 and AZD1480, in blocking IFNcR
signaling. As an indicator of IFNcR signaling, we assessed STAT1 phosphorylation by intracellular pSTAT1 staining and FACS. MFI: geometric mean
fluorescence intensity. (I) Lethally irradiated (900 cGy) Balb/c mice were transplanted with TCD BM (56106
) obtained from B6 WT mice and pan T cells
(56105
) isolated from B6 WT or IFNcR2/2 mice at day 0. INCB018424 was administered s.c. twice a day for 31 days (days +1–+31). INCB018424
treatment for 31 days results in free of GvHD in 90% of recipients and 100% survival when mice are transplanted with IFNcR2/2 T cells.
