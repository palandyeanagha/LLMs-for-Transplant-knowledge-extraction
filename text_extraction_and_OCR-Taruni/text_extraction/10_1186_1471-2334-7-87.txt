Abstract
Background: Endophthalmitis is the inflammatory response to invasion of the eye with bacteria
or fungi. The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery varies between 0.072–0.13
percent. Treatment of endophthalmitis with fungal etiology is difficult.
Case Presentation: Case 1: A 71-year old male diabetic patient developed postoperative
endophthalmitis due to Aspergillus flavus. The patient was treated with topical amphotericin B
ophthalmic solution, intravenous (IV) liposomal amphotericin-B and caspofungin following
vitrectomy.
Case 2: A 72-year old male cachectic patient developed postoperative endophthalmitis due to
Scopulariopsis spp. The patient was treated with topical and IV voriconazole and caspofungin.
Conclusion: Aspergillus spp. are responsible of postoperative fungal endophthalmitis.
Endophthalmitis caused by Scopulariopsis spp. is a very rare condition. The two cases were
successfully treated with local and systemic antifungal therapy.
Background
Endophthalmitis is an intraocular infection caused by
bacteria or fungi. Eventhough it is a rare condition, thera￾peutic options are limited and it affects the vision seri￾ously. The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract
surgery varies between 0.072%–0.13% as reported in pub￾lications of the past 10 years [1]. In 83% of postoperative
endophthalmitis cases, the infectious agents are bacteria,
especially gram positive bacteria. However, few studies
have been based on collected microbiology data regarding
fungi. In these series the rate of fungal endophthalmitis
varies between 8.6–18.6% [2,3]. This aspect is also lacking
in another large prospective series[4]. Candida albicans
and Aspergillus spp. are the most frequently isolated organ￾isms in fungal cases [2,5]. Treatment of endophthalmitis
with fungal etiology is difficult. Systemically or intra-vit￾really administered amphotericin-B is the most com￾monly used drug in the treatment of fungal

endophthalmitis. It has been reported that it can also be
given in the anterior chamber [6]. In recent years, new
anti-fungal agents such as caspofungin and voriconazole
have been developed as an alternative to amphotericin-B,
and successful results were reported [7-10].
The present article discusses the outcomes of two cases of
endophthalmitis due to A. flavus and Scopulariopsis spp.
following phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL)
implantation.
Case Presentation
Case 1
A 71-years old male, diabetic patient underwent phacoe￾mulsification and IOL implantation for right-sided senile
cataract. He underwent an operation due to colon cancer
4 years before cataract surgery and received chemotherapy
for one year. He had controlled diabetes without signs of
diabetic end organ diseases at the time of cataract surgery.
Visual acuity was 0.7 preoperatively and achieved 1.0 at
postoperative 2nd week. Topical steroid and antibiotic
drops were prescribed postoperatively. Medication was
continued for one month. At postoperative third month,
patient presented visual acuity decrease and redness in the
operated eye. Visual acuity was counting finger at one
meter. Slit lamp biomicroscopic examination showed cil￾iary injection, anterior chamber reaction and cotton fiber
appearance between the IOL and posterior capsule (Figure
1). This was not noticed in previous follow-ups. Therefore
possibility of a foreign body such as cotton was excluded.
The appearance was similar to mould hyphae. Endoph￾thalmitis was suspected and anterior chamber fluid and
vitreous examples were cultured preoperatively. Ampho￾tericin-B (5 µg/0.1 cc) and cefuroxime (1 mg/0.1 cc) were
administered into the anterior chamber while amphoter￾icin-B (10 µg/0,1 cc), amikacin (0.4 mg/0.1 cc) and van￾comycin (1 mg/0.1 cc) were given intravitreally. Despite
this treatment, biomicroscopic and clinical appearance
continued to deteriorate and IOL and capsular remnants
were removed with anterior vitrectomy. Anterior chamber
fluid, and vitreous examples were cultured periopera￾tively, IOL was also cultured. Amphotericin-B (5 µg/0.1
cc) and cefuroxime (1 mg/0.1 cc) were administered into
the anterior chamber. Topical amphotericin B (0.1 mg/cc)
ophthalmic solution and intravenous (IV) liposomal
amphotericin-B (Ambisome®) (3 mg/kg/day) were
started. Aspergillus flavus was isolated from the cultures.
Dense fibrinoid reaction developed around the pupil and
in the vitreous during the follow-up period. Pars plana vit￾rectomy and silicon oil injection were performed. Intraoc￾ular triamcinolone (0.4 mg/0.1 cc) and amphotericin-B
(2.5 µg/0.1 cc) injection performed. In-vitro susceptibility
with E test revealed that the pathogen's MIC for ampho￾tericin-B was 4 µg/ml. Consequently, IV caspofungin
(Cansidas®), with a loading dose of 70 mg for one day fol￾lowed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/day for the follow￾ing days, was added to IV liposomal amphotericin-B. In
the second week of the treatment, nephrotoxicity due to
systemically used liposomal amphotericin-B occurred.
Therefore the treatment was continued with caspofungin
only. Following the 6-weeks treatment, corrected visual
acuity was 0.5 (based on logMAR chart) and caspofungin
treatment was terminated. No signs or symptoms of endo￾phthalmitis were observed during the 6-months follow￾up.
Case 2
A 72-year old male patient with phthisical right eye had
phacoemulsification and IOL implantation for senile cat￾aract of the left eye. The patient, weighing only 36 kg, was
cachectic secondary to eating problems (nausea and vom￾iting) due to gastrectomy operation. He underwent this
operation five years ago. He had received oral supplemen￾tation (with high protein content) before the cataract sur￾gery. Fundus examination showed "dry type" age related
macular degeneration. Preoperative visual acuity was 0.1
(based on Snellen chart) and achieved 0.5 (based on Snel￾len chart) after an uneventful phacoemulsification sur￾gery. Topical steroid and ciprofloxacin treatment was
started postoperatively. These medications were gradually
reduced over a period of one month and stopped. The
patient was referred to us for uveitis at postoperative third
month. He was suffered from decreased vision and pain.
Topical steroid drops had been prescribed. Visual acuity
limited to hand motion and biomicroscopic examination
showed inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber.

There was a little improvement of the symptoms with ster￾oid treatment. However, complaints were eventually
intensified. Fibrinoid inflammatory reaction and mem￾brane formation were noted around the pupil and the
anterior chamber. Considering endophthalmitis, anterior
chamber lavage was performed. Necrosis of and defect in
iris were observed beneath the membrane. Samples of
anterior chamber fluid were cultured. Vitreous was clean.
Vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 cc) and amphotericin-B (5 µg/0.1
cc) were administered into the anterior chamber. The
patient was treated empirically with topical fortified gen￾tamicin and vancomycin ophthalmic solutions, oral cip￾rofloxacin (750 mg, b.i.d), intravenous (IV) vancomycin
(500 mg, q.i.d) and meropenem (1 g, t.i.d). Due to suspi￾cious fungal growth in culture, IV liposomal amphoter￾icin-B (3 mg/kg/day) was started. Secondary to recurrence
of dense fibrinoid inflammatory reaction, IOL extraction,
vitrectomy and silicon oil injection were performed. Cor￾nea was also edematous. Voriconazole (2.5 µg/0.1 cc) was
given into the silicon-filled vitreous space and amphoter￾icin-B (5 µg/0.1 cc) into the anterior chamber. Culture
results yielded Scopulariopsis spp. In vitro susceptibility
with E test revealed that the infecting organism had a MIC
of >32 µg/ml for amphotericin-B. MIC for voriconazole
(VFEND®-Pfizer) was found 8 µg/ml with susceptibility
test using dilution method and MIC for caspofungin
(Cancidas®-MERCK SHARP & DOHME) was 4 µg/ml.
Henceforth, IV amphotericin-B was stopped and IV vori￾conazole (4 mg/kg, b.i.d) and caspofungin (50 mg/day)
were started. Voriconazole (2.5 µg/0.1 cc) was injected
into the silicon-filled vitreous space. Topical voriconazole
(0.01 mg/cc) ophthalmic solution was started. As the
hepatic enzymes elevated on the tenth day of the treat￾ment, IV voriconazole was stopped and topical voricona￾zole and IV caspofungin were administered for a course of
8-weeks. Visual acuity improved to counting finger from 3
meters at the postoperative 2nd month. Fungal endoph￾thalmitis did not recur during the 4 months follow-up
period. Corneal edema was still present and visual acuity
remained unchanged.
Conclusion
Endophthalmitis secondary to cataract surgery is a rare
but serious condition that affects vision. Previous studies
have shown that fungi are responsible of 8.6–18.6% of all
culture positive postoperative endophthalmitis [2,3].
Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis usually occurs sec￾ondary to dissemination of organisms from a distant
focus to the eye via blood and 2–15% of all endoph￾thalmitis cases are estimated to occur in this way [11-13].
On the other hand, exogenous endophthalmitis occurs
following eye surgery, penetrating traumas or corneal
ulcerations. Even though both types are rare, diseases with
abnormalities in immune system (diabetes, renal insuffi￾ciency, malignancies and AIDS), intravenous drug addic￾tion, endocarditis, recent major surgery, organ
transplantation, corticosteroid and cytotoxic drug use,
prolonged antibiotic use, long term intravenous catheter￾ization, genito-urinary and dental interventions increase
the risk of endophthalmitis [12-15]. Postoperative fungal
endophthalmitis is generally secondary to contaminated
intraocular irrigation fluids, air conditioning systems and
cluster infections during construction activities in hospi￾tals [16-18].
Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. are the most fre￾quently isolated organisms in fungal endophthalmitis
[2,16,19,20]. Candida spp. are isolated in the majority of
endogenous endophthalmitis whereas Aspergillus spp. are
responsible of postoperative fungal endophthalmitis
[3,5]. Aspergillus endophthalmitis is usually caused by A.
fumigatus and A. flavus [21,22]. With the exception of a
single case, there is no information on endophthalmitis
due to Scopulariopsis spp. in the literature [23].
Previous studies have shown that exogenous fungal endo￾phthalmitis has a long latent period, lasting for weeks,
even months after intraocular inoculation, and the mean
latent period was 7 weeks among these cases [24]. In a
study of Narang and colleagues [16] fungal endoph￾thalmitis was noted even 90–210 days after the operation.
First line of immunological defense against these fungi is
the macrophages which engulf conidia. Hyphae are elim￾inated mainly by neutrophils. Disorders of neutrophil
function play the major role in the development of infec￾tion by these pathogens in invasive aspergillosis models.
Especially in diabetic patients, poor glycemic control is
known to impair immune systems [25,26]. Same effect is
observed after steroid; steroids facilitate the development
of infection by impairing the defense mechanisms against
the fungus exogenously acquired. We re-assessed our cases
in the light of this information but failed to identify
another endogenous focus following physical examina￾tion and analyses. The first case had type II diabetes that
was not under control especially in the last months. The
second case had excessive cachexia and biochemical anal￾yses revealed excessive hypoproteinemia and hypoalbu￾minemia. Ophthalmic steroid solutions were used in both
patients to suppress the local post operative inflamma￾tion. However, these solutions may impair the immune
defense.
There are very few agents available for the treatment of
fungal endophthalmitis. Moreover, inability to routinely
test the sensitivity of the fungal pathogens under labora￾tory conditions presents a challenge in deciding on the
treatment. Until recently, first choice in medical treatment
of fungal endophthalmitis is systemic and intravitreal
amphotericin-B [27-31]. However, development of resist￾ance in fungal pathogens and concerns of focal retinal

necrosis that might occur even with low doses of ampho￾tericin-B have prompted new therapeutic alternatives to
be developed. We are lacking sufficient clinical data on
the efficacy of combination antifungal therapy. The results
of in-vitro studies and animal models suggest that combi￾nation antifungal therapy may have additive activity
against fungal infections. In some studies, combination of
caspofungin and amphotericin-B was shown to have syn￾ergistic or additive against Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium
spp. (marked decrease in MIC of both) [32]. As caspofun￾gin inhibits fungal cell wall synthesis, penetration of
amphotericin B through the cell membrane is facilitated.
Combination antifungal therapy is an alternative
approach in infections with multidrug resistant fungi and/
or infections that do not respond to standard therapy.
[33]. In our first case, antifungal susceptibility test
revealed a MIC of 4 µg/ml for amphotericin-B. Therefore
caspofungin was added to the treatment. Acute renal fail￾ure developed on the second week of treatment which
required termination of amphotericin-B. Treatment was
continued with caspofungin to complete the 6-weeks
course. In the second case, Scopulariopsis spp. was isolated
with a serious resistance pattern. Scopulariopsis spp is
known for its resistance to amphotericin-B. On the other
hand, we are lacking sufficient data regarding intraocular
penetration of caspofungin and its efficacy in ophthalmic
infections. However, there are enough studies on vorico￾nazole. Marangon and colleagues [8] carried out a study
to determine in-vitro susceptibility of pathogens responsi￾ble of ocular fungal infections and showed that voricona￾zole was effective against most pathogens including mold
and concluded that voriconazole could be used in ocular
infections. In another study that investigated the reliabil￾ity of intravitreal voriconazole, researchers showed that
there was no retinal toxicity with doses ≤25 µg/mL in rats
and argued that 100 µg voriconazole can be used for
human vitreous body of 4 ml [7]. We administered
amphotericin-B (3 mg/kg/day) IV and into the anterior
chamber (5 µg/0.1 cc) empirically. As soon as isolating
Scopulariopsis spp. from the culture, antifungal susceptibil￾ity testing was carried out. As a result MICs for amphoter￾icin-B, voriconazole and caspofungin were >32 µg/mL, 8
µg/mL and 4 µg/mL, respectively. Considering its high
MIC value, 2.5 µg/0.1 cc voriconazole was administered
into the vitreous filled with silicon. Concurrently, ampho￾tericin-B was replaced by IV voriconazole (4 mg/kg, b.i.d)
and caspofungin (Loading dose on day 1: 70 mg, Mainte￾nance dose: 50 mg/day). Following this treatment, clinical
improvement was achieved in the patient. However, on
day 10 of the treatment hepatic enzymes became elevated
and this was accepted as toxic hepatitis. IV voriconazole
was stopped and hepatic enzymes returned to normal dur￾ing follow-up. Treatment was continued with IV caspo￾fungin and locally administered voriconazole solution for
8 weeks.
There are few cases successfully treated with combination
antifungal therapy in the literature [9,10]. Similarly, in
our patients we used combination antifungal therapy.
Unfortunately, one of our patient experienced side effects
due to voriconazole and the other to amphotericin-B.
Treatments were continued with caspofungin.
In conclusion, the success was not totally related to treat￾ment with caspofungin. Local treatment with an antifun￾gal agent and even a short course of another systemic
antifungal also contributed to the good outcome. Both
local and systemic antifungal therapy may be the best
approach in endophthalmitis caused by resistant fungi.
