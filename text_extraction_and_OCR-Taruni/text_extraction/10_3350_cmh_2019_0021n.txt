In patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without both macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic 
metastasis, the initial treatment choice recommended is transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Before sorafenib 
came into wide use, TACE had been pointlessly carried out repeatedly. It was in the early 2010s that the concept of TACE 
refractory was advocated. Two retrospective studies from Japan indicated that conversion from TACE to sorafenib the 
day after patients were deemed as TACE refractory improved overall survival compared with continued TACE, according 
to the definition by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Nowadays, phase 3 trials have shown clinical benefits of several 
novel molecular target agents. Compared with the era of sorafenib, sequential treatments with these molecular target 
agents have gradually prolonged patients’ survival and have become major strategies in patients with HCC. Taking these 
together, conversion from TACE to systemic therapies at the time of TACE refractory, compared with before, may have a 
greater impact on survival and may be considered deeper in the decisions-making process in patients with unresectable 
HCC who are candidate for TACE. Up-to-date information on the concept of TACE refractory is summarized in this review. 
We believe that the survival of patients with unresectable HCC without both macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic 
metastasis may be dramatically improved by optimal timing of TACE refractory and switching to systemic therapies. (Clin

burden with well liver function are the best candidates for resec￾tion. Another alternative treatment option for those with up to 
three nodules or nodules 3 cm or smaller (without both macrovas￾cular invasion [MVI] and extrahepatic metastasis [EHM]) is local 
ablation therapy (radiofrequency ablation or microwave abla￾tion).3-8 All over the world, the first-line treatment widely recom￾mended for unresectable HCC without both MVI and EHM is tran￾sarterial chemoembolization (TACE), which is a locoregional 
treatment.3-8 Novel molecular target therapies have been proven 
the effectiveness in phase 3 studies, and thus, several treatment 
options have become standard systemic therapies for advanced￾stage HCC or for those tumors progressing to locoregional treat￾ment.9-14 However, creating a distinct definition of the timing of 
switching from locoregional treatment to systemic therapies in 
patients with HCC is not easy. Thus far, consultation with experts 
with advanced knowledge is needed when deciding to give up lo￾coregional treatment and switching to systemic therapies in the 
field. Therefore, the aims of this study were to review the efficacy 
and limitations of TACE and discuss the most appropriate timing 
for switching from locoregional treatment to systemic therapies.
RECONSIDERATION OF TACE FROM THE CUR￾RENT PERSPECTIVE
TACE is the most widely used treatment worldwide for unre￾sectable HCC.2,3,15 The Bridge to Better Outcomes in HCC (BRIDGE) 
study, an international large and longitudinal cohort study that 
included 18,031 patients in 14 countries, indicated that TACE was 
frequently performed not only for patients with intermediate￾stage HCC but also for patients with early- or advanced-stage 
HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging 
system.15 Looking back at the history of TACE, improved patient 
survival with TACE compared with best supportive care or subop￾tional treatments was demonstrated by a meta-analysis of six ran￾domized controlled trials in 2003.16 Therefore, both Eastern and 
Western guidelines have recommended TACE as therapy in pa￾tients with intermediate-stage HCC (Table 1).4-8 So far, there are 
two major TACE techniques, namely, conventional TACE (cTACE), 
which uses a lipiodol mixture with chemotherapy agents, and 
TACE with drug-eluting bead (DEB-TACE).17-24 In one randomized 
controlled trial comparing cTACE and DEB-TACE, no difference 
was found in tumor response and time to progression.24 The deci￾sion whether to undergo cTACE or DEB-TACE seems to be depen￾dent on the medical situation of each country or the institution.
Institutions with a high volume of patients or substantial experi￾ences have advanced TACE techniques.20,25-28 So far, cone-beam 
or interventional radiology angiography computed tomography 
systems can construct three-dimensional reconstruction of arter￾ies and support superselective TACE.29-31 Moreover, inserting a 
catheter into the tumor feeding arteries superselectively leads to 
the prevention of liver function and reduction in negative side ef￾fects. Using a large cohort of patients (n=815), Yamakado et al.32
reported that selective TACE contributed to survival outcomes in 
patients who received TACE (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.48–0.97; P=0.033). Another systemic review indicated 
that the most common adverse events were related to the 
postembolization syndrome, including increased liver enzyme 
(18.1%), fever (17.2%), abdominal pain (11.0%), vomiting (6.0%), 
and nausea (1.7%).20 In a recent randomized placebo-controlled 
trial,33 it was that indicated prophylactic dexamethasone prevent￾ed postembolization syndrome, although validation is required. 
Current treatment-related death rate is estimated to be less than 
1% in patients with HCC.

Best timing for switching to systemic therapies
http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2019.0021n
A latest systemic review that had, to date, more than 10,000 
patients with HCC undergoing TACE documented a 52.3% objec￾tive response, with overall 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 
70.3%, 51.8%, 40.4%, and 32.4%, respectively.20 Nowadays, the 
median overall survival (OS) of patients with intermediate-stage 
HCC who received TACE is suggested to be around 30 months.2
 In 
more than half of patients, objective response can be achieved by 
TACE, and tumor progression may be delayed in these patients.10
However, a latest international observation study (the outcomes 
of HCC patients treated with TACE and early, not early or not at 
all followed by sorafenib [OPTIMIS] study) found that with repeat￾ed TACE, expectation rates of objective response decreased (first 
TACE: 40%; second TACE: 26%; third TACE: 24%; and fourth 
TACE: 25%).34
A recent report based on a US database (n=3,967)35 demon￾strated deterioration of liver function from baseline in the acute 
period, which persisted in the chronic period (bilirubin, 30% and 
23%; albumin, 52% and 31%; aspartate transaminase, 44% and 
25%; alanine transaminase, 43% and 25%; and prothrombin 
time, 25% and 15%, respectively). Hiraoka et al.36, using a Japa￾nese multicenter cohort, reported that liver function deteriorated 
with repeated TACE. It is well known that in patients with HCC, 
retaining liver function is equally important as removing or con￾trolling tumor.36 That is, it is possible to experience decreasing liv￾er function without getting an objective response when continu￾ing TACE without appropriate decisions.
WHAT IS “TACE REFRACTORY”?
In most cases of unresectable HCC, before the use of sorafenib 
was approved, treatment with TACE was continued casually. Re￾peated TACE is associated with increased liver failure and dimin￾ishing efficacy. If treatment with TACE is continued without any 
assessment, the patient loses the opportunity to convert to sys￾temic therapy because of liver function deterioration.37 Regarding 
recommendations or suggestions for patients with unresectable 
HCC to switch from TACE to systemic therapies, “TACE refractory” 
is a new-era concept that has been advocated since sorafenib was 
first used in practice (Table 2).4,5,38-41 It has been suggested that 
the appropriate timing of switching from TACE to systemic thera￾pies is when repeated TACE is expected to become ineffective, 
the so-called TACE refractory. Kudo et al.38,39, from Japan, pub￾lished one of the major suggestions on this topic. Their recom￾Table 2.

mendation was validated in two retrospective studies that showed 
that patients with intermediate-stage HCC whose disease was re￾fractory to TACE and who switched to sorafenib had prolonged 
OS compared with those who continued TACE (first trial: 25.4 vs. 
11.5 months, P=0.003; second trial: 24.7 vs. 13.6 months, 
P=0.002).42,43 Currently, a large cohort global prospective obser￾vation study (OPTIMIS) confirmed that compared with other treat￾ments, switching to sorafenib immediately after TACE ineligibility 
improved OS (propensity score matched cohort: 15.2 vs. 11.8 
months).34
Regarding liver function, one Japanese study confirmed that liv￾er function was not preserved with continuing TACE treatment af￾ter TACE refractory; patients with TACE refractory who continued 
to receive TACE had a significantly shorter median time to liver 
dysfunction than did those who switched to sorafenib (17.0 vs. 
29.8 months, P=0.030).42 In another other study, patients with 
TACE refractory who underwent repeated TACE had a greater in￾crease in Child-Pugh score compared with patients who were 
converted to sorafenib.43 Taken together, these two studies 
strongly suggest that repeated TACE leads to deterioration in liver 
function in patients who are deemed refractory to TACE.
WHY IS “TACE REFRACTORY” EMPHASIZED 
NOW?
At present, phase 3 trials have proven the statistical significance 
of five molecular target agents as both first-line (sorafenib and 
lenvatinib) and second-line (regorafenib, ramcirumab, and cabo￾zantinib) treatments for patients with HCC.9-14 These drugs have 
been approved worldwide. Moreover, on the basis of early-phase 
trials, the US Food and Drug Administration also approved two 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizum￾ab).44,45 Looking back at the results of the phase 3 trials in pa￾tients with HCC, both the testing and control arms had increased 
median OSs during the previous decade as a result of the treat￾ments after progression.9,10,14,46,47 In the study of regorafenib after 
sorafenib in patients with HCC (RESORCE) trial, Finn et al.48 re￾ported a median OS of 26.0 months for the regorafenib arm from 
the time sorafenib was started, although the included population 
in the trial was limited because of strict inclusion criteria. Several 
retrospective studies have reported that sequential therapies 
might have an impact on the survival of patients with advanced 
HCC.49,50 In the next era, a major strategy in patients with HCC 
seems to be sequential treatment with systemic therapies, al￾though different countries or regions have different regulations 
regarding the use of each drug. That being said, in TACE refracto￾ry patients, survival outcomes with systemic therapies are sug￾gested to be longer than with treatment with a single agent, like 
sorafenib.
Moreover, when considering using two or more molecular tar￾get agents in the clinical treatment of identical patients with HCC, 
we should focus on maintaining liver function more than we did 
in the previous era. Liver function deterioration leads to missed 
opportunities to start or switch to systemic therapies. Several lat￾est reports have demonstrated that the high-tumor-burden popu￾lation of patients with intermediate-stage HCC (large size or/and 
a lot of nodules) were at high risk of liver function deterioration 
after TACE.51-53 Two retrospective studies, which criticized the Ja￾pan Society of Hepatology’s definition of TACE refractory, report￾ed that 20–25% of patients had decreased liver function and 
Child-Pugh class B or C at the time they were deemed TACE re￾Figure 1. Concept of “Stop and think carefully before proceeding to each TACE.” TACE, transarterial chemoembilization.

fractory even though they were determined to have Child-Pugh 
class A at the time of initial TACE.42,43 Taken together, the optimal 
timing to convert from TACE to systemic therapies may be when 
the patient’s condition becomes unstable, which is different 
among individuals based on each patient’s tumor status, treat￾ment outcome of previous TACE and hepatic spare ability.
Recently, Kudo et al.54 compared survival outcomes between 
TACE and lenvatinib in seven patients with intermediate-stage 
HCC by using the propensity score matching method. In this study, 
the lenvatinib group had no history of receiving TACE. Despite the 
presence of several biases, the result might suggest the possibility 
that systemic therapies can become the initial treatment choice 
and may replace TACE in a limited population of patients with in￾termediate-stage HCC. A randomized controlled trial that com￾pares systemic therapy and TACE will be carried out in the near 
future.
STOP AND THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE PRO￾CEEDING TO EACH TACE
With the development of novel compounds and the improving 
survival outcomes of patients with HCC, current systemic thera￾pies should be considered as a treatment option for unresectable 
HCC. Especially in patients with intermediate-stage HCC, who can 
expect long clinical courses with better prognosis compared with 
advanced-stage HCC, updated treatment strategies with multimo￾lecular agents focusing on not only short-term outcomes but also 
foresight with long-term perspectives are required. A validity as￾sessment of the TACE procedure should be recommended before 
proceeding to each TACE (Fig. 1). In cases where the effectiveness 
of TACE is not expected or chronic liver function deterioration may 
occur after TACE, conversion to systemic therapies should be con￾sidered. Although the definition of TACE refractory by the Japan 
Society of Hepatology is useful information, switching the timing 
of TACE to way before the patient’s liver function deteriorates, 
taking into account both the high expectations of clinical outcome 
with current sequential therapies of molecular target agents and 
preventing hepatic spare abilities, may be better. Radiologists, 
who have the responsibility for TACE, and hepatologists or oncol￾ogists should communicate more closely and construct treatment 
strategies for patients with unresectable HCC who receive TACE 
with a view of the prospect to convert from TACE to systemic 
therapies.
CONCLUSIONS
The present guidelines recommend TACE as first-line treatment 
for patients with unresectable HCC without both MVI and EHM. 
Several novel compounds have shown survival benefits in patients 
with advanced HCC. Nowadays, sequential therapies with two or 
more agents have prolonged patients’ survival outcomes and 
have become predominant treatment strategies among patients 
with HCC. The anticipated clinical impact of systemic therapies in 
patients with HCC has increased, and conversion from TACE to 
systemic therapies is now weighed more heavily. Before starting 
treatment with TACE, conversion to systemic therapies or not 
should be considered (“Stop and think carefully before proceeding 
to each TACE”). Looking ahead to the future of systemic thera￾pies, it is now necessary to foster a greater understanding of pre￾serving liver function during TACE treatments.
