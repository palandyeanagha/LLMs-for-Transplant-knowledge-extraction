Abstract
Background: It is unknown whether defining chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on one versus
two estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assessments changes the prognostic importance of
reduced eGFR in a community-based population.
Methods: Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular
Health Study were classified into 4 groups based on two eGFR assessments separated by 35.3 ±
2.5 months: sustained eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (1 mL/sec per 1.73 m2
); eGFR increase
(change from below to above 60); eGFR decline (change from above to below 60); and eGFR
persistently ≥60. Outcomes assessed in stratified multivariable Cox models included cardiac events
and a composite of cardiac events, stroke, and mortality.
Results: There were 891 (4.9%) participants with sustained eGFR < 60, 278 (1.5%) with eGFR
increase, 972 (5.4%) with eGFR decline, and 15,925 (88.2%) with sustained eGFR > 60. Participants
with eGFR sustained < 60 were at highest risk of cardiac and composite events [HR = 1.38 (1.15, 1.65)
and 1.58 (1.41, 1.77)], respectively, followed by eGFR decline [HR = 1.20 (1.00, 1.45) and 1.32 (1.17,
1.49)]. Individuals with eGFR increase trended toward increased cardiac risk [HR = 1.25 (0.88, 1.77)]
and did not significantly differ from eGFR decline for any outcome. Results were similar when
estimating GFR with the CKD-EPI equation.
Conclusion: Individuals with persistently reduced eGFR are at highest risk of cardiovascular
outcomes and mortality, while individuals with an eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at any time are
at intermediate risk. Use of even a single measurement of eGFR to classify CKD in a community
population appears to have prognostic value.
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by either evidence
of kidney damage, including microalbuminuria, or by
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min per
1.73 m2 (1 mL/sec per 1.73 m2
), with the requirement that
these persist for at least 3 months [1]. Although two reports
from clinical databases present sensitivity analyses account￾ing for repeated measures of creatinine assessed in subsets of

their study populations requiring more frequent clinical
evaluations [2,3] and a report from a third clinical database
examines the affect of classifying CKD using creatinine
measured at varying time intervals as dictated by clinical
practice [4], most community-based cohorts linking CKD
with subsequent cardiovascular disease and mortality use a
single measurement of baseline serum creatinine to define
CKD [5-9]. Critically, reliance on a single measurement or
non-systematic ascertainment of serum creatinine to define
disease prevalence may result in misclassification. For
example, although a single creatinine measurement was
used to estimate the US prevalence of CKD in the National
Health and Nutrition Evaluation Surveys (NHANES)
[10,11], in the subset of NHANES III where serum creatinine
was measured twice over a median of 17 days, creatinine
values differed by 0.2% ± 9.7% [10]. Similarly, if micro￾albuminuria on a single urine specimen rather than
persistent microalbuminuria defined stage 1 and 2 CKD in
NHANES III, as many as 6.4 million additional individuals
in the US could be classified as having CKD [12].
While evidence suggests that a rapid decrement in kidney
function is associated with a significant increased risk of
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in older adults
[13], the chronicity of stage 3 CKD classification and the
prognostic significance of this chronicity over a three￾year interval has not been carefully studied in a
community-based cohort. In epidemiologic cohorts, it
remains unknown whether classification of CKD based
on one versus two measurements results in a different set
of individuals, and whether classification based on two
measurements carries different prognostic importance.
The utility in defining a disease state is that, once
identified, those individuals with that condition can be
1) designated as higher risk for sequelae of that
condition and 2) treated for this risk (1). Therefore,
regardless of misclassification, if a one-time measure of
estimated GFR (eGFR) consistent with CKD identifies
individuals at increased risk of the common sequelae of
CKD, specifically cardiovascular disease and mortality,
its importance remains.
Accordingly, in the current study, we evaluate the stability
of CKD classification, based on National Kidney Founda￾tion Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Improvement
(KDOQI) guidelines [1], using two creatinine measure￾ments over three years in individuals from 2 large
community-based cohorts, the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study and the Cardiovascular Health
Study (CHS). We then assess the cardiovascular disease
and mortality risk associated with four kidney function
groups based on eGFR change over time: sustained eGFR
< 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2
, with eGFR that changes from
below to above 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2
, with eGFR that
drops below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 after having been
above 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2
, and with eGFR persistently
≥60 mL/min per 1.73 m2
.
Methods
Study Population
Individual patient data were pooled from 2 community￾based, longitudinal studies, ARIC and CHS, available as
de-identified data from the US National Institutes of
Health. ARIC recruited 15,792 subjects, ages 45 to 64 years,
between 1987 and 1989. CHS included 5,201 subjects,
65 years and older, randomly selected from Medicare
eligibility files during 1989 and 1990. In both studies,
follow-up occurred at 3-4 year intervals; data from the
initial and the first follow-up visits are used in this analysis.
An additional 687 African American participants were
recruited in CHS from 1992-1993; they were not included
here due to limited follow-up. Further details of these
studies are described elsewhere [14,15].
Creatinine Calibration
In ARIC, serum creatinine was assessed in 15,582 (99%)
subjects at their initial visit, while in CHS it was assessed
in 5,716 (97%) subjects. We indirectly calibrated mean
individual first visit creatinine values from ARIC and
CHS to mean NHANES III for a given age, race and sex,
following a fixed offset of -0.23 mg/dL (20 μmol/L) to
calibrate to Cleveland Clinic values, resulting in adjust￾ments of -0.24 mg/dL (21 μmol/L) in first visit ARIC
values and -0.11 mg/dL (10 μmol/L) in first visit CHS
values [16].
Because informative censoring from death and dropout
results in a non population-based sample, second visit
measurements cannot be calibrated to NHANES values in
the same manner. In ARIC, second visit serum creatinine
values were adjusted by -0.24 mg/dL (21 μmol/L) accord￾ing to published data [17]. In CHS, the first visit for the
African American cohort and the second visit for the
original cohort were concurrent. As creatinine calibration is
performed to account for assay differences and there
should not be a difference in calibration factor by race,
we indirectly calibrated the African American cohort to
African American participants in NHANES III as described
above. This calibration model showed that serum creati￾nine values were 0.04 mg/dL (3.5 μmol/L) greater in the
CHS African-American cohort than NHANES III; accord￾ingly, we subtracted this value from second visit measure￾ments in the CHS cohort. Estimated GFR was calculated
with the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) Study equation [18].
Using these two eGFR values, participants were then
classified into 4 groups: 1) eGFR < 60 mL/min per
1.73 m2 (eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at both visits);

2) eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (≥60 mL/min per
1.73 m2 at both visits); 3) eGFR increase ( < 60 mL/min
per 1.73 m2 at first visit and ≥60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at
second visit); and 4) eGFR decline (≥60 mL/min per
1.73 m2 at first visit and < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at
second visit).
Baseline Covariates
Other baseline variables included demographics (age,
sex, race, education status), lifestyle characteristics
(smoking, alcohol intake), glycemic and antihyperten￾sive medication use, past medical history (diabetes,
hypertension and cardiovascular disease), examination
findings (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist-to￾hip ratio (WHR), electrocardiogram results); and blood
laboratory variables (total cholesterol, high density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, albumin, glucose). Sec￾ond visit data were used in multivariable models for all
variables except albumin where 1st visit data were used.
Race was defined as white or African American. Educa￾tion level was dichotomized by high school graduation
status. Cigarette smoking was stratified as never, former
or current, and alcohol use was dichotomized by current
use. Diabetes was defined by self-reported history, use of
oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin, or fasting glucose
≥126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L). Hypertension was defined
by systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic
≥90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medications.
WHR was calculated by dividing waist circumference by
hip circumference. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
was defined by electrocardiographic criteria [19]. History
of cardiovascular disease was defined by prior recog￾nized or silent myocardial infarction, angina based on
the Rose questionnaire, stroke, transient ischemic attack,
intermittent claudication, and/or prior coronary angio￾plasty or bypass procedures.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac events
(myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or
fatal coronary disease), stroke, or all-cause mortality.
Secondary outcomes included individual components
of the primary composite outcome. ARIC only identifies
time to the first cardiac and stroke event and does not
provide data on subsequent events. Therefore, those
participants who had a cardiac event (n = 178) or a
stroke (n = 62) between their first and second visits were
defined as having a history of CVD but were excluded
from analyses examining future cardiac or stroke out￾comes; these 235 individuals (5 had both a cardiac event
and stroke) were only included in analyses examining
mortality.
Study Sample
From a pooled sample of 21,680 individuals, we excluded
the African American cohort from CHS enrolled at the time
of the second visit (n = 687). Of the remaining 20,993
participants, we excluded 156 who were missing age, sex
or race data, 184 missing first visit creatinine, and 27 with
first visit eGFR < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 to avoid inclusion
of dialysis patients, yielding 20,626 eligible participants. Of
these, 2,560 (12.4%) were missing eGFR at their second
visit, with reasons including death prior to the expected
follow-up time (n = 675), no reported laboratory results
(n = 460), no data after the second visit (n = 1), and no
second visit (n = 1,424; 1,078 from ARIC and 346 from
CHS), yielding a final study population of 18,066
individuals used in univariate analyses (Figure 1). There
were 17,698 participants with no missing covariates used
in multivariable analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Second visit characteristics were compared with analysis
of variance for continuous variables and chi-square
tests for categorical variables. Proportions of individuals
falling into each kidney function classification were
calculated and stability of classifications was defined by
remaining above or below 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
. As a
sensitivity analysis, among participants missing a second
GFR estimate the minimal and maximal variation in
stability of classification of sustained eGFR < 60 was
estimated by assuming that a) eGFR remained below
60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 from the first to the second visit
and b) eGFR changed groups from below to above
60 mL/min per 1.73 m2
.
Event rates were calculated and Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis was used to estimate the nonparametric survival
distribution among study participants by eGFR group
beginning at the time of the second GFR estimate. Cox
proportional hazards regression utilized the SAS proce￾dure ‘TPHREG’ with a class statement for eGFR group
to examine differences in study outcomes among the
respective comparison groups while adjusting for cov￾ariates. All models a priori included the following:
age, sex, race, education, study of origin; smoking and
drinking status; diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovas￾cular disease history; systolic blood pressure, WHR, and
LVH; and non-HDL cholesterol and albumin. In addi￾tional analyses evaluating models that revealed no
significant differences in hazards for study outcomes
between individuals with eGFR decline and eGFR
increase, these two groups were combined and analyses
repeated with a 3-level exposure term that also included
sustained eGFR < 60 and sustained eGFR ≥60 mL/min
per 1.73m2
. The proportional hazards assumption was
checked by testing the significance of the correlation

coefficient between survival time for the composite
outcome and the scaled Schoenfeld residuals using a chi￾square statistic with a two-sided p-value and was met for
all covariates.
Because prior research has found less consistent relation￾ships between individuals with eGFR between 50 and 59
and adverse outcomes [3], we performed sensitivity
analyses assessing study outcomes in individuals with
eGFR sustained ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2
, individuals
with eGFR sustained between 50 and 59 mL/min per
1.73m2
, and individuals with eGFR sustained below
50 mL/min per 1.73m2
. We also tested the effect of
including the initial eGFR in multivariable models.
Lastly, we performed a second series of analyses that
duplicated the primary analyses but utilized eGFR
calculated with the CKD-EPI estimating equation rather
than the 4-variable MDRD equation after indirect
calibration of serum creatinine from a non-IDMS to an
IDMS standard [20].
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1. The
Institutional Review Board at Tufts Medical Center
approved this research.
Results
Study Participants
There were 20,626 participants with first visit eGFR
≥15 mL/min per 1.73m2
, 18,066 of whom had two GFR
estimates (Figure 2). First visit eGFR was < 60 mL/min
per 1.73m2 in 409 (16.0%) of the 2,560 individuals
missing a second visit eGFR compared to 1,169 (6.5%)
of the 18,066 individuals with a second visit eGFR (p <
0.0001). Among 1,578 participants with first visit eGFR
below 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
, 186 (11.8%) died prior
to the second visit, while, among 19,048 participants
with first visit eGFR above 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
, 489
(2.6%) died prior to the second visit (p < 0.0001).
Participants missing second visit data had a higher
prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors than
those with second visit data. Among participants who
died prior to the second visit, mean age was 67.8 years
and 41.7% had a history of CVD, 28.2% had diabetes
and 73.2% had hypertension. Among those alive but
missing their second visit, mean age was 62.1 years and
21.9% had a history of CVD, 17.0% had diabetes and
56.2% had hypertension. This compares to first visit
mean age 58.2 ± 9.5 years, CVD prevalence of 15.3%,
diabetes prevalence 10.6% and hypertension prevalence

of 43.3% among participants who subsequently had a
second study visit (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons).
Chronicity of eGFR Classification
Among those with longitudinal data, there were 1,169
participants with first visit eGFR < 60 mL/min per
1.73m2
. Of these individuals, 891 (76.2%) had eGFR
persistently below this level at follow-up while 278
(23.8%) had eGFR that rose above 60 mL/min per
1.73m2 at follow-up (Figure 3). As a sensitivity analysis,
if none of the 409 individuals with baseline eGFR <
60 mL/min per 1.73m2 and missing subsequent eGFR
had persistent eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
, the
stability of stage 3 CKD identification based on a single
assessment could be as low as 56.5% (891/1,578) while,
if all 409 individuals had persistently low eGFR,
persistence could be as high as 82.4% (1,300/1,578).
Numbers of individuals with persistently reduced eGFR,
with eGFR below 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at the first visit
and ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at the second visit (eGFR
increase), with eGFR ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at the first
visit and < 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at the second visit
(eGFR decline), and with both measurements ≥60 mL/
min per 1.73m2 are shown in Figure 2. Mean time
between measurements was 35.3 ± 2.5 months and was
similar across groups (p = 0.8). Participants with
sustained eGFR < 60 were older, had higher systolic
blood pressure, and more likely to be white and diabetic
than those with eGFR persistently > 60 mL/min per
1.73m2
. Those who experienced eGFR decline had
significantly lower baseline eGFR than those eGFR
persistently > 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
; additionally,
those with GFR decline were significantly older, more
likely to be female, more frequently had a history of
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, and
had higher systolic blood pressure. Individuals with an
increase in eGFR were similar to those who experienced
an eGFR decline (Table 1).
Cardiovascular and Mortality Outcomes
Event rates for all outcomes were highest among those with
sustained eGFR < 60, followed by those with eGFR decline
and eGFR increase; event rates were lowest for those eGFR
persistently > 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 (Figure 4). Results of
univariate analyses are presented in Table 2 and Figure 5, 6,
7 and 8 and reveal a graded risk of adverse outcomes based
on kidney function group. Individuals with sustained eGFR
< 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 were at greatest risk.
In multivariable analyses, individuals with sustained eGFR
< 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 were at highest risk for all
outcomes followed by those with eGFR decline (Table 3).
Individuals with eGFR increase trended to increased cardiac
and stroke risk in multivariable models. There was no
significant difference in the hazard ratios associated with
eGFR decline and eGFR increase in fully adjusted models
for any of the four study outcomes, although this may have
been limited by power. When participants classified as
eGFR increase or eGFR decline were considered as a single

group in order to assess the association of having an eGFR
below 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at any point with outcomes,
this combined population was at significantly increased
risk of all study outcomes compared to those with eGFR
persistently ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 [Hazard Ratio (HR) =
1.21 (1.02,1.44) for cardiac outcomes; HR = 1.30
(1.04,1.63) for stroke; HR = 1.38 (1.21,1.58) for death;
and HR = 1.28 (1.14,1.43) for composite outcomes in fully
adjusted models]. Inclusion of baseline eGFR in the
multivariable models did not substantially affect the
hazard ratios associated with the eGFR groups (Table 4).
Mild Sustained Decreased eGFR and Outcomes
There were 338 individuals with eGFR that remained
between 50 and 59 mL/min per 1.73m2 at both the first
and second study visit and 250 individuals with eGFR <
50 mL/min per 1.73m2 at both study visits. In fully
adjusted models, compared to those with eGFR sustained
≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2
, individuals with a mild
sustained decrease in eGFR were at significantly increased
risk of composite events and all-cause mortality
[HR = 1.28 (1.06,1.55) and 1.45 (1.17,1.72), respec￾tively] and trended to increased risk of cardiac and stroke
events [HR = 1.27 (0.96,1.69) and 1.33 (0.92,1.92),
respectively]. Of note, there were only 57 cardiac events
and 35 strokes in these individuals. Individuals with eGFR
sustained < 50 mL/min per 1.73m2 were at significantly
increased risk of all study outcomes when compared to
those with sustained ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 (data not
shown).

GFR estimated using the CKD-EPI Equation
There was 96.6% agreement in classification between the
MDRD and CKD-EPI prediction equations; the notable
difference was a decrease in the prevalence of individuals
with sustained eGFR below 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
, as
well as decreases in both the eGFR decrease and increase
groups, with a corresponding rise in the sustained eGFR
≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 group (Table 5). The propor￾tion of individuals with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
or ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at their second study visit
stratified by the initial eGFR is presented in Figure 9. The
relationship between the kidney function groups and
study outcomes were similar to those seen when using
the MDRD equation (Table 6).
Discussion
The current study demonstrates that individuals with
persistent reduction in eGFR are at highest risk of
cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, while classifying
individuals with an eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at any
time as being at intermediate risk of cardiovascular
events and mortality. We also demonstrate that there is a
moderate lack of chronicity in classification of CKD
based on a single assessment in this longitudinal cohort,
with 23.8% of individuals with baseline eGFR below
60 mL/min per 1.73m2 who were able to attend a follow￾up 3 years later having eGFR ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at
that time.
There are several findings in this study that are important.
First, we confirmed the risk relationship of reduced eGFR,
estimated both with the MDRD and CKD-EPI estimating
equations, with cardiac, stroke and death events that has
been described previously [2,8]. Second, we demonstrated
that there is some inconsistency when defining CKD with a
single measurement, with potential reclassification occur￾ring in 24% of individuals who would be defined as
having stage 3 CKD based on the first creatinine measure￾ment. Not surprisingly, these individuals had GFR esti￾mates at baseline that were close to the 60 mL/min per
1.73m2 threshold used by clinical guidelines to define
stage 3 CKD and were disproportionately women when
compared to those with eGFR sustained < 60 mL/min per
1.73m2
. Third, despite potential reasons for misclassifica￾tion, individuals with an eGFR below 60 mL/min per
1.73m2 at either visit were at substantially increased risk of
adverse outcomes in univariate analyses, those with an
eGFR decline were at increased risk in multivariable
analysis, and even those with an eGFR increase showed
trends toward increased risk in multivariable analyses.
Fourth, we demonstrated that categorization based on the
most recent GFR estimate likely is a better predictor of

outcomes, as individuals with eGFR decline, in comparison
to those with eGFR increase, were at higher risk of death
and composite outcomes in univariate analysis and
showed trends toward higher risk of composite outcomes
in multivariable analysis. Similar relationships have been
demonstrated with the utility of albuminuria for predicting
incident kidney failure [21]. Fifth, we were able to
demonstrate that individuals with a mild sustained
reduction in eGFR (50-59 mL/min per 1.73m2
) were at
increased risk of adverse outcomes when compared to
individuals with eGFR sustained > 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
.
By exploring multiple GFR estimates in a well-defined,
widely generalizable population with systematic ascer￾tainment of comorbid conditions, laboratory variables
and clinical outcomes, our study adds to previous
findings that were predominantly derived from data￾bases of repeated GFR estimates in populations receiving

clinical care in large healthcare systems. Recently, Eriksen
and Ingebretsen analyzed creatinine measurements
obtained as a part of routine clinical activity in North
Norway and noted that, as the interval between GFR
estimates rose from 3 month to 12 months, the propor￾tion of individuals with baseline eGFR between 30 and
60 mL/min per 1.73m2 who subsequently experienced
an improvement in eGFR to ≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2
dropped from 4.8% to 2.3% [4]. Our study also adds
substantially to the findings of Go and colleagues and
O’Hare and colleagues [2,3]. O’Hare and colleagues note
that, among the 30% of their population with multiple
serum creatinine measures within 6 months of the
baseline assessment, 81% remained within the same
eGFR category while 8% had moved to a higher eGFR
category and 11% to a lower eGFR category. Importantly,
O’Hare and colleagues also noted that individuals with
stable eGFR between 50 and 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 did
not have an increased risk of mortality when compared
to individuals with eGFR > 60 mL/min per 1.73m2
. Our
findings differ in this regard, perhaps reflecting the
different nature of clinical and epidemiologic cohorts as
well as the different duration between creatinine
measurements.
Using a single baseline measure of serum creatinine to
estimate GFR for purposes of determining CKD stage and
the risk associated with reduced kidney function offers
reasonable accuracy. Although, given the number of
individuals who did not have a second GFR estimate, it
is possible that eGFR may be persistently low as little as
56.5% of the time, it is more likely that informative
censoring occurred as individuals without a second eGFR
were more likely to have an adverse event and reduced
eGFR has been shown in multiple studies to be
associated with poor outcomes [2,8,22]. This suggests

that a single eGFR measurement can identify stage 3 or
higher CKD in a population-based sample approxi￾mately 75-80% of the time. This is important informa￾tion for interpreting prior literature that has relied on
only a single baseline creatinine assessment to estimate
kidney function and CKD [11].
One weakness of this study is our dependence on
indirect calibration of serum creatinine for determina￾tion of longitudinal changes in eGFR. While we used the
best available methodology for calibration, our calibra￾tion corrections remain dependant on population
assumptions. However, errors in calibration would be
systemic across all groups and would overall bias results
toward the null. The finding of a graded relationship
between kidney function category and clinical outcomes
that is consistent with clinical expectations supports the
use of these calibration factors. An additional weakness
is that estimating equations by definition rely on
assumptions regarding the relationship between demo￾graphic characteristics and muscle mass to determine
GFR [23]; however, confirmation of results using the
newly developed CKD-EPI GFR estimating equation is
reassuring. Further weaknesses include a substantial
portion of baseline participants without serum creati￾nine assessment at the time of their follow-up visit and
the absence of data on albuminuria. Additionally there
are multiple reasons for creatinine change over time,
including both progression and remission of kidney
disease, measurement error, use of medications affecting
creatinine secretion, altered creatinine generation due to
body composition changes, and major alterations in
dietary intake. We are unable to differentiate among
these. Finally, we utilize three-year follow-up rather than
reassessment at three months as suggested in clinical
guidelines as more frequent measures are unavailable.
This study also has several notable strengths. We utilize a
well-characterized cohort with generalizability to the
overall US population for the analyses. There is thorough
event ascertainment and extensive data on traditional
cardiovascular disease risk factors. Finally, participants
were considered to be medically stable and generally
healthy at the time of enrollment, adding to general￾izability.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the major findings in this manuscript are:
1) There is moderate change in classification of CKD
when using two rather than one eGFR assessment in this
longitudinal cohort, with 23.8% of individuals with
baseline eGFR below 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 who were
able to attend a follow-up 3 years later having eGFR
≥60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at that time; and 2) Individuals
with persistent reduction in eGFR, even those with only
mildly reduced eGFR, are at increased risk of cardiovas￾cular outcomes and mortality, while individuals with an
eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 at any time are at
intermediate risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
These data support the use of most recent eGFR as well as
longitudinal changes in eGFR to assign risk, while
