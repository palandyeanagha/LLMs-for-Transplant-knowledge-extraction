Abstract
Background: The progression of hepatic fibrosis may result in decompensated hepatic failure with cirrhosis, liver related
events (LRE) such as ascites, variceal bleeding, and death after successful and timely Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) in
biliary atresia. The aim of this study is to suggest clinical benefit of the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient
elastography at 3 months after the Kasai operation to predict LRE.
Methods: Between January 2007 and December 2011, 69 eligible biliary atresia patients who underwent Kasai HPE and
performed transient elastography before and 3 months after HPE were included. The occurrences of LRE were analyzed for
all patients. All patients were divided into 2 groups (with and without LRE) for comparison. Multivariate analysis was used to
detect the independent risk factors of LRE. The area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to
establish the LSM optimal cutoff value of 3 months after Kasai operation in predicting LRE.
Results: LSM value, aminotransferase, albumin, bilirubin, and PT-INR significantly differed among the two groups.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated LSM value as the most powerful independent factor of the development of LRE. The cut￾off value of 19.9 kPa was calculated to be optimal for predicting LRE development with total sensitivity and specificity of
1.804. AUROC resulted in 0.943, with sensitivity of 85.3% and specificity of 95.2%.
Conclusions: The LSM value of 3 months after Kasai HPE can be a useful predictor of LRE development.

Introduction
Since the introduction of hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) by Dr.
Kasai in the 1950s, it has been the treatment of choice for biliary
atresia patients. More than 90% of patients undergo Kasai HPE
after diagnosis of biliary atresia while some patients with
progressed end stage liver disease chose the transplantation first,
although liver transplantation is performed during follow-up on up
to 50% of children who already had the Kasai operation. [1] The
most common reason for secondary liver transplantation is failure
of the Kasai operation, which presents as persistent cholestasis and
progression of liver cirrhosis. [2] However, even if a patient has
underwent a successful and timely operation, this progression of
histological fibrosis occurs in almost all patients, [3] leading to
biliary atresia as the main indication of children’s liver transplan￾tation. Therefore, long-term follow-up of biliary atresia patients
with close monitoring of fibrosis and cholestasis is important.
Progression of subclinical compensated liver disease may result
in decompensated hepatic failure with cirrhosis, liver related
events (LRE) such as ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic enceph￾alopathy and death. Although clinical features and laboratory data
can be helpful, definitive diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis
is classically performed with a histological examination of liver
tissue obtained from a liver biopsy. Due to the limitations (such as
invasiveness and excessive pain) involved in performing liver
biopsy, alternative methods for diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis have
been emerging. [4]
The hepatic fibrosis scan (Fibroscan, Echosens, Paris, France), a
new medical device, allows for a noninvasive, rapid, painless, and
reproducible method, [5,6] is based on transient elastography to
measure liver stiffness. Good reproducibility with low variability
has been reported in many previous studies. [5,7,8] Analyses using
the intra-class correlation coefficient and correlation with different
patient-related and liver disease–related covariates have previously
shown intra- and inter-observer agreements. The overall inter￾observer agreement and intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.98
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.977–0.987). [7]
The results measured by Fibroscan correlates well with the
histological stage of liver fibrosis. [8] Liver volume measured by
Fibroscan is at least 100 times larger than usual liver biopsy
samples; therefore, results from Fibroscan are expected to be a
more representative sample of the whole hepatic parenchyma. [7]

Since the first report using the Fibroscan in 2003, [5,9] it has
been used and validated in many hepatic diseases. In addition, its
feasibility in children as well as in adults has been identified. [10]
Previous studies have discussed the relationship between liver
stiffness measured by Fibroscan and the liver associated compli￾cations in adults with chronic liver disease; liver stiffness
measurement (LSM) may be useful as a predictor of the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompen￾sating events in chronic hepatitis B. [11,12]
LSM has proved it’s feasibility in children even younger than 24
months [13] with various liver diseases. [14] Some studies on
children compared liver LSM after biliary atresia between patients
with and without esophageal/gastric varices. [15,16] However,
few studies on children have focused on overall complications of
liver failure using LSM. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
determine a clinical benefit of LSM at 3 months after the Kasai
operation in order to predict LRE.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Approval
This study was approved by the ethical committee from Yonsei
University College of Medicine, Severance Hospital, and study
protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data
was collected from the medical records and stored in a locked
study member’s computer without patients’ identifiers. The
consent was not obtained, because it was a non-invasive study
and specifically waived by the approving institutional review board
(IRB).
Patients
Between January 2007 and December 2011, a total of 69
children who underwent Kasai HPE at a single center and had
Fibroscan examination before and 3 months after a Kasai
operation were included in the study. In addition, the occurrence
of LRE was analyzed for 69 children.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) LSM failure (no valid
shots), 2) invalid LSM [defined as an interquartile range (IQR) to
median value ratio (IQR/M).0.3], success rate ,60%, or ,10
valid measurement], 3) a history of hepatic decompensation, 4) co￾infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D or HIV, 5) right￾sided heart failure and 6) loss to follow-up. No patients were
excluded.
A total of 69 children were divided into two groups: one group
who had developed LRE and one group without any event after
Kasai HPE. A comparison between the groups was performed.
Among several factors, the independent risk factors of LRE
development were accessed using multivariate analysis. The areas
under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) were
used to establish the LSM cutoff value of 3 months after the Kasai
operation in predicting LRE.
Laboratory Tests & Liver Histopathology
Laboratory examinations were collected 3 times: on the same
day of the Kasai operation (baseline study), 3 months after the
surgery, and during follow-up. Data including aspartate amino￾transferase (AST), alanine amino-transferase (ALT), serum albu￾min, serum bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), prothrombin time (PT-INR), and
platelet count were recorded. The upper normal range of AST
and ALT were 40 IU/L.
Liver specimens were obtained during Kasai operation and
were examined by an experienced pathologist. The METAVIR
scoring system, [17] which consists of 5 stages, based on the
architectural features of portal fibrosis, was used. (F0 = no fibrosis,
F1 = portal fibrosis without septa, F2 = portal fibrosis and few
septa, F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis, and F4 = cirrhosis).
LSM
Liver stiffness was measured before the Kasai operation and at a
follow-up period of 3 months after the Kasai procedure using
Fibroscan. The methods were similar to those of our previous
study. [16] The right lobe of the liver through the intercostal
spaces was targeted until 10 successful measurements were
obtained. Each child was placed in the supine position with
maximal abduction of their right arm. The median value among
10 measurements of liver stiffness was calculated automatically by
software on a microcomputer installed in the Fibroscan, and is
expressed in kilopascals (kPa). A success rate of LSM of at least
60% has been considered reliable. [16,18]
Definition of LRE
LRE in this study included esophageal/gastric variceal bleeding,
ascites, prolonged jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, hepato-renal
syndrome and death. Variceal bleeding was diagnosed by
endoscopic evaluation when bleeding developed from the enlarged
veins in the distal esophagus or gastric fundus. [19] An imaging
study such as ultrasonography or computed tomography was used
to diagnose ascites; fluid collection in the abdomen related with
cirrhosis was observed in the imaging study. [20] Jaundice (serum
bilirubin $5 mg/dl [85//mmol/l]) was defined according to the
guidelines of Asian Pacific Association for the study of the liver.
[21] Liver related death was defined as death caused by the
complications of end-stage liver disease during follow-up of biliary
atresia after Kasai operation.
Statistical Analysis
Data was written as mean 6 standard deviation (SD), median
value with range, and N (%). The baseline characteristics of
subjects were compared using the chi-squared and Fisher’s exact
tests. To document the independent effective factors of LRE
development, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
hazard regression analyses were performed. Corresponding 95%
confidence intervals and hazard ratio (HR) are demonstrated in
the study. In addition, AUROC values, which maximized the sum
of sensitivity and specificity, were described to identify the optimal
cutoff value of LSM predicting LRE development. The cumulative
incidence rates of LRE were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method with log-rank test. All statistic analyses were performed
using the SPSS statistical software (version 18.0, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL). A P value ,0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
Results
Characteristics of All Patients
A total of 69 patients (19 male and 50 female) were studied. The
characteristics of each child at baseline and at 3 months after the
operation are shown in Table 1. The mean age before operation
was 10.6666.03 weeks, and the AST and direct bilirubin were
146.56108.9 and 7.0462.75, respectively. The median LSM
value was 10.3 kPa before surgery and 16.5 kPa after 3 months in
all patients. F3 and F4 METAVIR fibrosis stages were noted in 8
(11.6%) and 10 (14.5%) patients.
Comparison Between Groups with and without LRE
Among total 69 patients, 27 (39.1%) cases showed LRE
development (Table 2). At the time of the Kasai operation, the

mean age of the patients with LRE development was older than
that of the patients without LRE (14.0468.13 versus 7.8564.00,
P,0.001). AST and ALT were higher (208.06112.3 versus
107.0687.00, 183.0699.9 versus 89.9671.1, P,0.001) and direct
bilirubin was also higher in the group with LRE (8.6462.78 versus
6.0062.21). The median LSM values were 21.7 kPa versus
6.7 kPa at baseline, with a higher value in patients who developed
LRE during follow-up. Furthermore, the total bilirubin, GGT,
and PT-INR results showed a significant difference between the
two groups.
For the two groups, the differences between before and 3
months after the Kasai operation were similar (Table 2). AST and
ALT were more elevated in patients with LRE. The total￾bilirubin, direct-bilirubin, and GGT were also higher in patients
with LRE. Albumin was significantly lower in patients who had
developed LRE. The median LSM at 3 months after surgery
(34.8 kPa) was higher in patients with LRE than in patients
without LRE development (13.1 kPa).
Patient Characteristics at Follow-Up
At the follow-up assessment, mean age was 5.463.7 years, and
the duration after the Kasai HPE ranged from 75 weeks to 445
weeks. Among 69 patients, 27 patients developed LRE; 9 cases of
jaundice, 4 cases of ascites, 7 cases of variceal bleeding, 9 patients
expired due to complications of chronic liver disease, and 2 cases
of combined events (Table 3). There was no hepatic encepha￾lopathy and hepato-renal syndrome in the patients during follow￾up. AST, total-bilirubin, and direct-bilirubin during follow-up
were more elevated in patients with LREs than in patients without
LRE. Albumin was significantly lower in the LRE group while
GGT and PT-INR was significantly higher in the LRE group
compared with the non LRE group. LRE developed an average of
32.5629.4 months after the operation. Eleven children underwent
liver transplantation during the follow-up period.
Independent Risk Factors of LRE Development
As shown in Table 3, LSM value, AST, ALT, albumin, total￾bilirubin, direct-bilirubin, and PT-INR significantly differed
among patients with and without LRE. The multivariate analysis
identified LSM value as the most powerful independent factor for
the development of LRE (P = 0.018, HR, 1.258; 95% CI, 1.032–
1.522; Table 4).
Accuracy of LSM Cut-off Value of 3 Months after Kasai
Operation in Predicting LRE
Table 5 shows the optimal LSM cut-off value for all subjects, as
well as the corresponding sensitivity and specificity. The clear cut￾off value (19.9 kPa) was obtained for LRE development with a
total sensitivity and specificity of 1.804. Furthermore, the positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the
19.9 kPa cut-off value of the LSM were 92.0% and 90.9%,

respectively for the prediction of LRE. Using ROC curve analysis
to determine the optimal LSM cut-off value for partitioning the
two groups, 19.9 kPa showed the most accuracy (Figure 1).
AUROC resulted in 0.943, with sensitivity of 85.3% and

Discussion
Biliary atresia is a disease with a progressive and inflammatory
course resulting in irreversible cholestasis and end stage liver
disease even with early surgical interventions. Multifactorial
pathways lead to immune-mediated intrahepatic and extrahepatic
damage of bile ducts, ductular proliferation and finally progressive
portal fibrogenesis. [22] The exact pathogenesis of the progressing
hepatic fibrosis in biliary atresia is not well known but recent
progressions have been made to reveal some key factors and
markers associated with fibrogenesis.
Honsawek et al. [23] proposed a positive correlation between the
serum osteopontin level and the progression of hepatic fibrosis in
biliary atresia patients, serum adiponectin, and gelectin-3 as a
marker of liver stiffness. [24,25] These studies use LSM, which has
become a reliable and popular tool in assessing hepatic fibrosis, as
a comparative factor; however, further clinical validations and
applications with LSM are currently being discussed.
Extrahepatic cholestasis is one of the factors that affect LSM,
[26] therefore, LSM values with an IQR/M below 0.3 were
selected to minimize the influence of cholestasis.
Since the introduction of LSM, it has been shown that LSM can
overcome the limitations of liver biopsy and other conventional

Predicting Liver Related Events Using Fibroscan

biomarkers for its noninvasiveness and reproducibility; many
reports have been documented that compare LSM with other
clinical data of end stage liver disease patients and have proven the
usefulness of LSM especially in adults. Transient elastography can
be used to monitor disease progression or predict the development
of liver-related complications. [24] Over the past five years,
reports focusing on the risk assessment of esophageal/gastric
variceal bleeding among children with transient elastography in
biliary atresia children have been documented. [25,27] Esopha￾geal/gastric varices are one of the life threatening complications of
portal hypertension, and studies have revealed that LSM is a useful
tool in predicting esophageal/gastric varices since its result
correlates with the presence of varices. In the reports, comparisons
of LSM were conducted between groups who have varices and
groups who do not have varices; Chongsrisawat et al. [15] showed
that the liver stiffness score was higher in patients with esophageal
and/or gastric varices than in the control group without varices
(LSM 37.72621.55 versus 10.9768.71 kPa; P,0.001), while
Chang et al. [16] also reported similar results showing LSM for
the group with varices and for without varices of 21.35610.31 and
9.7568.61, respectively (P,0.001).
While this study was performed retrospectively, it is unique
because we predicted LRE with the LSM values that were
collected 3 months after the Kasai operation in each child. Three
months is accepted as the duration of hepatic congestion and
cholestasis after the surgery that requires resolution, and successful
bile flow is an important factor for prognosis in biliary atresia
patients. In a previous report, the resolution time of the jaundice
after Kasai operation was an average of 60–70 days. [28]
Moreover, it was suggested that by 3 months after HPE, a clear
difference in total bilirubin levels was evident between children
with good outcomes and bad outcomes. [29] We found that
patients with high LSM 3 months after the surgery showed a
tendency for higher LSM during follow-up, finally resulting in a
higher incidence of LRE. Previous studies were focused mainly on
esophageal and/or gastric varices among various LRE, while this
study showed a clinical implication including other LRE. Patients
with not only varices but also other LRE following biliary atresia
such as ascites, prolonged jaundice, and death were counted and
that LSM values among the two groups (with or without LRE)
have been compared to set up the cut off value.
The group with high LSM and abnormal lab results (high AST
and ALT, low platelet count, and prolonged PT) before surgery
showed similar results 3 months after the surgery and during
follow-up. Among the several variables, LSM after 3 months of
surgery was the most powerful tool in predicting LRE and
prognosis of the patients. Using an ROC curve, the LSM value of
19.9 kPa was suggested as the cut-off value to predict LRE.
Moreover, patients with LSM values .19.9 kPa were found to
have more risk of LRE development. Through this result we
propose more intense preemptive care for patients with high
possibility of LRE after Kasai HPE.
Patients with a high LSM value 3 months after surgery finally
showed a higher LRE value. Therefore, more attention, frequent
follow-up, and monitoring for these patients is recommended.
There are a number of limitations to this study: more patients
are needed to represent a more reliable study, the cut-off value of
19.9 kPa is a relatively limited result based on the data of 69
patents, the data from a large number of patients are required to
establish a more accurate cutoff value. And the study was
performed retrospectively, patients who are not eligible to the
study have been excluded at first, this might have resulted in bias.
Moreover, follow-up duration after the Kasai HPE was different
among each patient.
In conclusion, since LSM after 3 months of surgery correlates
with LRE, our study suggests that LSM would provide clinical
benefit giving family and care providers advance warning of the
anticipated course potentially allowing patients to be treated more
aggressively to lessen the complications of end-stage liver disease
during follow-up of biliary atresia after their Kasai operation.
However, larger scale prospective studies and long term follow-up
would be needed to establish a reliable reference for LSM.
