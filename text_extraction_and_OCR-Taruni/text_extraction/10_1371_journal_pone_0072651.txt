Abstract
Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often preceded by underlying cardiac diseases causing ventricular pressure overload.
Objective: It was our aim to investigate the progression of atrial remodeling in a small animal model of ventricular pressure
overload and its association with induction of AF.
Methods: Male mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham operation. After four or eight weeks,
echocardiographic measurements and hemodynamic measurements were made and AF induction was tested. The hearts
were either fixed in formalin or ventricles and atria were separated, weighed and snap-frozen for RNA analysis.
Results: Four weeks of pressure overload induced ventricular hypertrophy and minor changes in the atria. After eight weeks
a significant reduction in left ventricular function occurred, associated with significant atrial remodeling including increased
atrial weight, a trend towards an increased left atrial cell diameter, atrial dilatation and increased expression of markers of
hypertrophy and inflammation. Histologically, no fibrosis was found in the left atrium. But atrial gene expression related to
fibrosis was increased. Minor changes related to electrical remodeling were observed. AF inducibility was not different
between the groups. Left ventricular end diastolic pressures were increased and correlated with the severity of atrial
remodeling but not with AF induction.
Conclusion: Permanent ventricular pressure overload by TAC induced atrial remodeling, including hypertrophy, dilatation
and inflammation. The extent of atrial remodeling was directly related to LVEDP and not duration of TAC per se.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia.
Risk factors for AF include hypertension, heart failure, valve
disease and advancing age [1]. AF is associated with electrical and
structural remodeling, including atrial dilatation, cellular hyper￾trophy, dedifferentiation, fibrosis, cell death and inflammation
[2,3]. AF mainly occurs in the presence of underlying diseases,
with hypertension being the most common [4,5].
Atrial remodeling is caused by both AF as well as underlying
diseases, as has been shown in models of heart failure [6,7],
hypertension [8–11], and ventricular pressure overload [11,12],
and also in patients with hypertension, heart failure or valve
disease [13–16]. Although AF is often preceded by conditions
associated with ventricular pressure overload, atrial remodeling in
this situation has not been investigated extensively, especially not
in small animal models [10–12]. The transverse aortic constric￾tion model (TAC) is a well established model in rodents, with left
ventricular hypertrophy progressing to heart failure [17,18]. Our
hypothesis was that in this model increased atrial pressure would
lead to atrial remodeling accompanied by AF inducibility. Small
animal models such as rodents are of interest, as they offer the
possibility to investigate the role of specific genes and proteins, i.e.
in transgenic and knock-out models, on the development of an
AF substrate [19]. In addition, it would offer the opportunity to
investigate the effects of therapeutic concepts, such as upstream
therapies, on the remodeling process and AF inducibility.
Therefore, it was our objective to investigate the progression of
atrial remodeling in a mouse model of ventricular pressure
overload, representing the situation of associated underlying heart

diseases such as hypertension, and to investigate AF inducibility
in this model.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal
Experimentation of the University of Groningen (Approval ID:
DEC6121) and were conducted under international guidelines on
animal experimentation.
Animals and housing conditions
Male C57Bl6/J mice at the age of 8–10 weeks, weighing 20–
25 grams, were obtained from Harlan (The Netherlands). During
the entire experiment, animals were kept on a 12 hr light:12 hr
dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.
Surgical procedures
Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (2% in O2). TAC was
performed as previously described [17]. In short, the thoracic
cavity was opened between the 2nd and 3rd rib, and a blunted
needle (27G) was placed on the aortic arch between both carotid
arteries. The aorta was tied onto the needle with a 7–0 silk suture.
Immediately thereafter the needle was removed. Sham operations
were performed in the same way, but the suture was removed
instead of being knotted. Animals were treated with analgesic
medication for 48 hr from the start of operation (Carprofen,
5 mg/kg subcutaneously).
Echocardiographic measurements
Four or eight weeks after TAC or sham operation, in vivo
cardiac dimensions and functional parameters were assessed with
M-mode and 2D transthoracic echocardiography (Vivid 7
equipped with 14-MHz linear array transducer; GE Healthcare,
Chalfont St. Giles, UK). Mice were anesthetized (2% isoflurane
in O2) as described above, and body temperature was maintained
by placing the mouse on a heating pad. Parasternal short axis
views were used to record M-mode tracings at left ventricular
mid-papillary level to measure left ventricular dimensions
(interventricular septum (IVS), left ventricular posterior wall
(LVPW), left ventricular internal diameter (LVID)) and %
ejection fraction (EF). Apical 4-chamber view was used to assess
left atrial (LA) size. LA length was measured at end-ventricular
systole from the tip of the mitral valve closure to the base of the
LA.
Hemodynamic measurements
Hemodynamic measurements were carried out prior to
sacrifice, four or eight weeks after TAC or sham surgery, using
a Millar catheter (Mikro-tip 1.4F; SPR-839, Millar Instruments,
Houston, TX, USA). Mice were anaesthetized as described above,
and a pressure transducer catheter was inserted via the right
carotid artery into the left ventricle. Pressures were recorded in the
aorta and subsequently in the left ventricle (LV). Furthermore, in
the LV determinants of contraction and relaxation of the LV were
determined, i.e. the dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin, indices of maximal
contraction and relaxation of the LV, and Tau, an isovolumetric
relaxation constant. The corrected dP/dt max and min values
were calculated by dividing the dP/dt max and min values by the
maximum LV pressure.
Atrial fibrillation measurements
A surface ECG was recorded using subcutaneous needles to
record lead I and lead II positions. Inducibility of atrial
arrhythmias was tested by applying a burst of electrical stimuli.
Briefly, an octopolar EP cathether 1.1F catheter (Scisense,
London, Ontario, Canada) was inserted into the right atrium
(RA) via the jugular vein. The catheter was connected to an
amplifier (AdInstruments GmbH, Spechbach, Germany) and the
signal from the electrodes was monitored using a Powerlab 8/30
(ML870) (AdInstruments GmbH, Spechbach, Germany) and the
software LabChart 7 (AdInstruments GmbH, Spechbach,
Germany). The inducibility of AF was tested by applying
bipolar 5-second bursts of electrical stimuli to the electrodes that
reside in the atrium (determined via live monitoring of the
signals of the electrodes) using MC_Stimulus II Version 3.2.4
and the stimulator STG4002 (Multi Channel Systems MCS
GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany). Atrial capture was confirmed
with stimulating at a cycle length of 100 ms. The pulses of the
first burst had a cycle length of 50 ms, decreasing to 33 ms,
25 ms, 20 ms, 15 ms and 10 ms in successive bursts. Rectan￾gular pulses of 1 V were used. Between these stimulations a
period of 30 s was chosen. AF was defined as a period of rapid
irregular atrial rhythm lasting .1s. If 1 or more bursts in the
series evoked an AF episode, AF was considered to be inducible.

When the AF duration approached 30 s duration the stimulus
protocol was manually stopped. The AF episode continued up to
a maximum of 5 min, after which the mice was sacrificed.
Sacrifice
After the hemodynamic measurements, mice were sacrificed by
excision of the heart. The heart was either fixed in 4% formalin,
desiccated and embedded in paraffin or ventricles and atria were
separated, weighed and snap-frozen for RNA analysis.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the pooled atria and LV tissue
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Breda, The
Netherlands) and cDNA was synthesized by QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) according to
the protocol. Gene expression was measured with Absolute
QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix (Abgene, Epsom, United
Kingdom) in the presence of 7.5 ng cDNA and 200 nM forward
and reverse primers. qRT-PCR was conducted on the Biorad
CFX384 (Biorad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Initial dena￾turation and activation of the DNA polymerase at 95uC for 3 min
was followed by 35 cycles with denaturation for 15 s at 95uC and
annealing and elongation for 30 s at 60uC, followed by a melt
curve. Gene expression levels were corrected for ribosomal
protein, large, P0 (36b4) reference gene expression, and values
were expressed relative to the control group. Primers used are
depicted in Table 1.

Histology
Tissue was cut in 4 mm sections. To determine the amount of
fibrosis, a Masson trichrome staining was performed as described
before [20]. Sections were photographed at the x40 scanning
mode with a slidescanner (NanoZoomer 2.0-HT, Hamamatsu
Photonics Nederland, Almere, the Netherlands) and analyzed with
Image Scope 11 (Aperio Technologies, Inc. Vista, CA, USA).
Fibrosis was expressed as the percentage of blue pixels compared
to the total area. The edge of the tissue was excluded. To measure
cardiomyocyte diameter a lectin staining was performed to detect
cell membranes, a counterstaining with DAPI (Vector Laborato￾ries, Burlingame, CA, USA) was done to see the nuclei. Sections
were photographed and cell diameter was determined using Image
J (Image J 1.43u, NIH, USA). Cardiomyocytes that were included
were transversally cut and a nucleus could be seen. Per animal 5
different fields were used and on average 60–65 cells were
measured. For histology of the LV, short-axis sections were used,
for analysis of the atria the hearts were cut in the long-axis
orientation.
Statistics
Data are expressed as mean values 6 standard error of the
mean (SEM). Comparisons between groups were done using one￾way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey’s test.
Correlations were analyzed using Pearson r correlation coefficient.
All analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 20,
SPPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P-values of ,0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Validation of the model – ventricular remodeling
Table 2 shows changes in LV hemodynamic parameters,
echocardiographic parameters and organ weights after four and
eight weeks of ventricular pressure overload. There was a
significant increase in aortic and ventricular pressure, ventricular
wall thickness and heart weight and a reduction of LV ejection
fraction. This was accompanied by an increased left ventricular
cell diameter (Figure 1a) and induction of fibrosis (Figure 1b). In
addition, left ventricular gene expression associated with hyper￾trophy was increased: 2.0-fold and 7.1-fold increase in atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP) (Figure 1c), 2.0-fold and 3.5-fold
increase in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Table 2), 1.6-fold

and eight weeks of TAC, respectively. Furthermore, expression
of genes associated with fibrosis was increased, including
expression of collagen I (Figure 1e), collagen III and fibronectin
(Table 2). Figure 1f shows representative echocardiographic
images.
Atrial remodeling
TAC caused an increased LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP)
(Figure 2a). In the atria, we observed a trend towards an increase
in cell diameter in the LA after eight weeks (p = 0.08, Figure 2b–c).
This was accompanied by an increased weight of the combined
atria (Figure 2d) and LA length as measured by echocardiography
(Figure 2e).
Gene expression markers, as determined in pooled atria, of
atrial hypertrophy were increased, including BNP (Figure 3a) and
growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) (Figure 3b). ANP
expression was not significantly increased. Skeletal a-actin
(Figure 3d), a marker of hypertrophy and dedifferentiation was
increased, although not significantly. Expression of regulator of
calcineurin (Rcan1), an indication of calcineurin activation, was
increased (Figure 3e).
Increased fibrosis in the LA was not detected in a Masson
staining (Figure 4a–b), but atrial expression of collagen type I
(Figure 4c), collagen type III (1.6-fold [ns] and 2.1-fold [P,0.01])
and fibronectin (1.6-fold [ns] and 2.7-fold [P,0.05]) were
increased. Expression of MMP2 and TIMP1 (trend) (Figure 4d,
e) was increased after 8 weeks of TAC, expression of TIMP2, 3
and 4 was unchanged as well as expression of MMP14.
Inflammation was shown by increased expression of the
inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte che￾moattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) after eight weeks of pressure
overload, by 3.9-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively (Figure 5).
No major changes in gene expression related to electrical
remodeling were observed. Figure 6 shows no change in gene
expression of the L-type calcium channel. Although expression
levels of Kcnd2, Kcnd3, Kcnj2 and Kcnj3 were reduced, this was

not significant. These genes encode Kv4.2, Kv4.3, Kir2.1 and
Kir3.1 and contribute to the cardiac transient outward potassium
current (Ito), inward rectifier current (IK1) and acetylcholine￾activated inward rectifier K+ current (IKACh). Expression of
Kcnq1, which encodes Kv7.1 and mediates the slow delayed
rectifying potassium current (IKs), was reduced to 73% of control
levels in animals subjected to TAC for 8 weeks.

AF induction was comparable between the groups, both in
incidence and duration (Figure 7).

markers of atrial remodeling, as determined in the combined atria,
independent of duration of TAC. LVEDP correlated with markers
of atrial hypertrophy (weight of the combined atria, BNP

expression), dilatation (LA length) and inflammation (IL-6).
Table 3 shows that also other markers of remodeling correlated
with LVEDP and with atrial weight. Interestingly, although LA
fibrosis was not increased using Masson’s staining, expression
levels of collagen type I, collagen type III, fibronectin, MMP2 and
TIMP1 did correlate with LVEDP and atrial weight. For genes
related to electrical remodeling, there was no correlation with
LVEDP and a weak correlation with atrial weight.
Discussion
The present study showed that four weeks of pressure overload
induced ventricular hypertrophy and only minor changes in the
atria. After eight weeks of pressure overload, a significant
reduction in left ventricular function occurred, associated with
significant atrial remodeling including increased atrial weight, a
trend towards an increased LA cell diameter, LA dilatation and
increased expression of markers of hypertrophy and inflammation.
Minor changes related to electrical remodeling were observed. In
addition, a significant increase in atrial fibrotic gene expression
without histologically detectable fibrosis in the LA was observed.
The extent of atrial remodeling was directly related to LVEDP
and not to duration of TAC per se.
This study was designed to investigate atrial remodeling
occurring in diseases preceding AF. In large animal models of
hypertension, atrial remodeling including atrial dilatation, cellu￾lar hypertrophy, fibrosis and inflammation and increased AF
inducibility have been described [8,9]. However, small animal
models are more useful to investigate the effect of specific genes
on the AF substrate [19]. Although a range of mouse models
related to AF have been described, the vast majority are
transgenic models [21]. Therefore, in this study a model of
TAC was used causing a sudden onset of pressure overload of the
heart to mimic the situation preceding AF, caused by underlying
diseases such as hypertension. This model has not been used
extensively to investigate atrial remodeling. Liao et al. demon￾strated increased atrial weight after 10 days of TAC, which was
accompanied by increased fibrosis and inflammation and
increased inducibility of AF, albeit short episodes [12]. Other
studies of pressure overload in rodents also showed an increase in
atrial diameter [22], atrial cellular hypertrophy [23] and an
increase in atrial weight, which was, as in our mice related to the
severity of left ventricular dysfunction [24]. These studies,
however, did not investigate AF induction [22–24]. In rats,
different models of pressure overload showed increased atrial
remodeling which was associated with increased AF inducibility
[10,11,25,26].
Compared to these studies, we observed similar adaptation
processes occurring in the atria in response to the increased
ventricular pressure but without an increased inducibility of AF.
We could demonstrate atrial hypertrophy as was shown by an
increased atrial weight, increased expression of genes associated
with hypertrophy and a trend towards an increase in LA cell
diameter. This trend and lack of significance in increase of atrial
cell diameter is possibly due to the low number, as atrial cell
diameter did correlate with the total heart weight. Interestingly,
ANP, a marker often used for ventricular hypertrophy was not
significantly increased in the atria, most likely due to the already
high baseline expression levels of ANP in the atria (75-fold higher
in the atria compared to the ventricles). In addition, we observed
an increased expression of markers of inflammation. Only minor
changes related to electrical remodeling were observed. Although

we observed an increased expression of genes associated with
fibrosis, as well as of some MMP and TIMPs, we could not detect
increased fibrosis histologically.
In contrast to our expectations AF inducibility was similar in
sham operated animals and after pressure overload for four and
eight weeks. The similar levels of AF inducibility might be
explained by the lack of histologically detectable fibrosis, which is
known to promote reentry and thus AF, or the lack of major
changes in ion channel expression, which has been related to
electrical remodeling. Another explanation might be the
relatively high level of AF inducibility in the sham operated
animals, possibly related to the thoracotomy. In humans,
postoperative AF occurs relatively often after cardiac surgery.
For coronary artery bypass surgery the reported incidence varies
from 16–50% [27].
Of most interest is the correlation between LVEDP and total
atrial weight with markers of atrial remodeling, showing increased
atrial remodeling with increased LVEDP and atrial weight. Some
animals with four weeks TAC had higher LVEDPs than those with
eight weeks TAC (Figure 8) also demonstrating more extensive
remodeling. Increases in LA pressure through ventricular pressure
overload therefore seems to be more important for remodeling
than duration of the hemodynamic alterations.
The use of mice in genetic models offers the advantage that
methods are established and could therefore also be used to
investigate atrial remodeling [19]. For example, Reil et al.
showed pronounced atrial remodeling and AF inducibility in
mice with cardiac overexpression of Rac1 [28], other examples
include cardiac specific overexpression of ACE and TGFb1
which also show atrial remodeling and increased AF inducibility
[29,30]. Many more transgenic mouse models have been
described related to AF [21]. However, to investigate the effects
of proteins with possible protective roles, a model with
pronounced atrial remodeling should be used. At this moment,
this is, for example, investigated in drosophila subjected to
tachypacing [31]. A major drawback of drosophila is that these
are invertebrates and their heart consists of a single tube. It would
be useful to have a non-genetic model to investigate the
relationship between atrial remodeling, AF and the gene of
interest. The TAC model seems to be a clinically relevant model
as it mimics pressure overload as seen with hypertension or heart
failure, and these diseases are often associated with atrial
remodeling underlying AF.
The ventricular pressure overload model, as used in this study is
suitable to investigate the effect on atrial hypertrophy and

inflammation, but cannot be used to investigate the effect on
inducibility of AF.
Limitations
The lack of fibrosis might be due to the short time frame of our
study. It is possible that after a longer period of TAC, fibrosis
might develop also in the atria as fibrotic gene expression is
already slightly but significantly increased at eight weeks pressure￾overload. A later time point, however, would be confounded by
the development of heart failure as LV function is starting to
deteriorate after eight weeks. It would be difficult to separate
pressure-dependent effects in the atria from other factors such as
neuro-hormonal activation, which was the goal of the present
study.
A surprising finding was the lack of AF inducibility that we
explain by the lack of fibrosis or of pronounced changes related to
electrical remodeling. On the other hand, we found a surprisingly
high AF inducibility in the sham group that might be explained by
the fact that these mice also underwent thoracotomy. We have no
control group with no surgery to rule out that sham surgery
induces AF inducibility per se. Expression data were obtained from
pooled RA and LA, although we realize that the RA and LA might
respond different to disease [32–34], we feel that this does not
affect our results. Most likely the RA has remodeled less, and we
are underestimating the observed changes in gene expression.
Conclusions
Permanent ventricular pressure overload by TAC induced atrial
remodeling, including hypertrophy, dilatation and inflammation,
but no detectable fibrosis. Atrial remodeling was associated with
an increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, but not with
AF induction. In summary, our results indicate that this model of
atrial pressure-overload cannot be used to investigate AF
inducibility, but can be used to investigate atrial remodeling.
