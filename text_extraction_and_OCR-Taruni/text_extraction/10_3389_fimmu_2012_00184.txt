Current clinical strategies to control the alloimmune response after transplantation do not
fully prevent induction of the immunological processes which lead to acute and chronic
immune-mediated graft rejection, and as such the survival of a solid organ allograft is
limited. Experimental research on naturally occurring CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ Regulatory
T cells (Tregs) has indicated their potential to establish stable long-term graft acceptance,
with the promise of providing a more effective therapy for transplant recipients. Current
approaches for clinical use are based on the infusion of freshly isolated or ex vivo
polyclonally expanded Tregs into graft recipients with an aim to redress the in vivo balance
of T effector cells to Tregs. However mounting evidence suggests that regulation of
donor-specific immunity may be central to achieving immunological tolerance. Therefore,
the next stages in optimizing translation of Tregs to organ transplantation will be through
the refinement and development of donor alloantigen-specific Treg therapy. The altering
kinetics and intensity of alloantigen presentation pathways and alloimmune priming
following transplantation may indeed influence the specificity of the Treg required and
the timing or frequency at which it needs to be administered. Here we review and discuss
the relevance of antigen-specific regulation of alloreactivity by Tregs in experimental and
clinical studies of tolerance and explore the concept of delivering an optimal Treg for the
induction and maintenance phases of achieving transplantation tolerance.

INTRODUCTION
Transplantation presents a life-saving treatment for patients with
end stage organ failure, however the success of this procedure
is restricted by the recipient immune response directed against
donor graft alloantigens and the clinical caveats associated with
immunosuppressive drugs aimed at controlling this immune
response. Current strategies for clinical management of trans￾plant recipients using sustained immunosuppression do not fully
prevent induction of the immunological processes which lead to
graft rejection, namely chronic allograft failure, and as such the
survival of a solid organ allograft is limited (Meier-Kriesche et al.,
2004b; Lamb et al., 2010). Whilst early attrition rates for solid
organ transplantation have significantly improved over the last
few decades, attributed to reduced ischemia times, improved clin￾ical procedures and patient care management, long term survival
of allografts have remained relatively unchanged, requiring the
majority of patients to have further organ transplants (Meier￾Kriesche et al., 2004a; Lodhi et al., 2011). As this inevitably results
in an escalating shortage of donor organs, there is a pressing
need to develop an alternative method to control the alloimmune
response which can establish stable long-term graft acceptance
through induction of donor-specific immunological tolerance.
Transplantation tolerance can be defined as a state of immune
unresponsiveness, downregulation or deviation of an immune
response to an inflammatory situation or insult such as that
generated by the recipient immune response following trans￾plantation. Decades of experimental research have identified that
mechanistic bases of immune tolerance may be through processes
of deletion, anergy, antigen sequestration or immunological igno￾rance, and also the focus of this review, through processes of
active regulation. Implementing mechanisms of immune regula￾tion for tolerance induction are more desirable as an approach as
it will, in principle, provide a mechanism which can adapt to the
dynamic and evolving immune response post-transplantation.
Amongst the T cell subsets with immunomodulatory properties,
the regulatory roles of thymus derived CD4+CD25highFoxP3+
naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been recog￾nized for many years and substantial research efforts have sought
to exploit their suppressive functions to deliver a tolerogenic
cell therapy for transplantation (Hippen et al., 2011; Lombardi
et al., 2011). This transition to the clinic has been facilitated
by the significant progress made over the last 5 years in identi￾fication of further markers to delineate stable suppressive Treg
subsets, such as CD45RA, CD161, CCR6, and low expression of
IL-7 receptor α chain CD127, in addition to previously described
expression of transcription factor Forkhead box p3 (FoxP3),
CTLA-4, GITR, and CD62L (Liu et al., 2006; Miyara et al., 2009).
Recently, their development as a cell therapy has been trans￾lated to clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation settings
(Sakaguchi, 2004; Sagoo et al., 2008) and use in phase I and

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
II clinical trials are showing tentative yet encouraging results in
terms of both safety and efficacy (Brunstein et al., 2011; Di Ianni
et al., 2011). The main therapeutic approach currently in use is
to infuse freshly isolated or ex vivo polyclonally expanded Tregs
into graft recipients with an aim to provide a more favorable
in vivo balance of T effector cells to regulatory cells. However,
our current understanding of the alloimmune response suggests
that regulation of donor-reactive immunity primed by specific
pathways of alloantigen-presentation following transplantation
may be central to achieving long-term or indefinite graft sur￾vival (Nepom et al., 2011; Wood et al., 2011). This concept is now
being supported by mounting experimental evidence from basic
and clinical studies, which indicate that the next stage in opti￾mizing translation of Tregs to solid organ transplantation will be
through the refinement and delivery of donor alloantigen-specific
Treg therapy.
This review article discusses the relevance of antigen-specific
regulation of alloreactivity by Tregs and explores the concept and
goal of defining an optimal Treg for the prevention of trans￾plant rejection and induction of organ transplant tolerance. We
identify the main features of the immune response which Tregs
need to control by firstly reviewing evidence for the induction
and temporal pattern of the alloimmune response, in terms of
alloantigen presentation and allopriming following transplanta￾tion, and the resulting effector mechanisms of graft rejection.
We then review evidence for the association of Tregs and Treg￾mediated donor-specific immune regulation in clinical transplan￾tation with particular focus on data emerging from the study
of operationally tolerant transplant recipients. After reviewing
these findings we then discuss the mechanistic bases of tolerance
induction by antigen-specific Tregs, and the requirements of an
optimized Treg to improve the success of this approach for the
induction and maintenance phases of achieving donor-specific
tolerance.
THE ALLOIMMUNE RESPONSE
Induction of the adaptive immune response to an allograft begins
with recognition of alloantigen by recipient T cells which is now
well characterized and known to occur through three main pro￾cesses known as the direct, the indirect, and the semi-direct
pathways of antigen presentation. The relative contributions of
the direct and indirect pathways of alloantigen presentation
toward graft rejection have been reviewed in detail elsewhere
(Afzali et al., 2007; Gokmen et al., 2008), however the key ques￾tions we examine here are whether the differential activity of
these alloantigen presentation pathways are associated with trans￾plantation tolerance, and whether their activity is modulated
though a process of active regulation which may otherwise be
achievable using alloantigen-specific Treg therapy. Our under￾standing of factors such as the temporal activity and intensity of
alloantigen presentation pathway activity, and resulting alloim￾mune priming following transplantation is integral to identifying
the specificity of the Treg required and the time or frequency
at which it needs to be administered to deliver an optimized
and targeted therapeutic. We therefore begin by providing a brief
updated overview of allorecognition, which is summarized in
Figure 1A.
PATHWAYS OF ALLOANTIGEN PRESENTATION
The direct pathway of alloantigen presentation is so named
as intact allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules expressed by donor allograft derived cells are directly
presented to recipient T cells. The most potent driver of CD4+
and CD8+ T cell responses with specificity for alloantigen pre￾sented by the direct pathway is through the migration of donor
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the allograft to the sec￾ondary lymphoid organs (Larsen et al., 1990). Here, donor MHC
alloantigens are recognized by alloreactive T cells which are esti￾mated to be of a relatively high endogenous frequency of between
1:100 and 1:100,000 T cells in humans (Hornick et al., 1998;
Game et al., 2003; Benitez and Najafian, 2008), and even higher
(1:10) in mouse (Suchin et al., 2001). As such, they are able
to elicit a vigorous inflammatory T cell response toward the
allograft resulting in early or acute rejection. This pre-existing
population of T cells with specificity for the direct pathway is
a long-standing conundrum in immunology, as recipient T cell
recognition of foreign MHC molecules which have not previously
been encountered in the thymus violates the rules of self-MHC
restriction therefore, direct allorecognition may be attributed
to cross-reactivity, namely the ability of self-MHC restricted T
cell T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize polymorphic residues
on foreign MHC through structural similarities between donor
and recipient MHC molecules (Lombardi et al., 1991; Lechler
et al., 1992), although evidence exists which favors the hypoth￾esis that the peptide primarily determines the diversity of the T
cell response (Weber et al., 1995). The latter may also explain
the occurrence of alloreactivity when donor and recipient MHC
are structurally dissimilar. Based on the nature of direct pathway
allorecognition (Gras et al., 2011), the direct pathway alloreac￾tive T cell compartment is predicted to arise equally from within
either naive CD45RA+ or memory CD45RO+ T cell compart￾ments and is polyclonal in nature (Merkenschlager and Beverley,
1989; Lombardi et al., 1990). Macedo et al. have recently provided
further evidence for this by studying effector functions (IFNγ
production), proliferation and precursor frequencies in isolated
human CD4+ and CD8+ naive and central/effector memory T
cell subsets, in response to stimulation with allogeneic peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Macedo et al., 2009). These
characteristics have particular relevance to the development and
application of effective immunosuppressive approaches to control
the direct alloresponse. A lesser described stimulator of the direct
alloresponse is that of the presentation of allogeneic MHC by
non-professional antigen presenting cells such as activated donor
endothelium or epithelium within donor tissue. While several
studies have shown this may be able to stimulate T cells requir￾ing lower costimulatory signal thresholds, such as memory T cells
(London et al., 2000; Berard and Tough, 2002), other work has
shown this may not necessarily result in productive stimulation
of alloreactivity (Marelli-Berg et al., 1996).
The indirect pathway of alloantigen presentation occurs when
recipient bone-marrow derived APCs capture, process, and
present allogeneic MHC determinates to recipient T cells. In
this pathway, alloantigen may be acquired from the circulation
from shed donor graft material, collected by recipient APCs traf￾ficking through the allograft, or through the phagocytosis of

donor APCs that have migrated to the draining lymph nodes.
As stimulation of this pathway is dependent upon the limitless
supply of graft-derived antigens, it is initiated immediately post￾transplantation and sustained throughout the life of the graft.
The pre-existing endogenous frequency of alloreactive T cells with
specificity for the indirect pathway is detected to be much lower
than that of the direct pathway, with a range in frequency of
1:100,000–1:1,000,000 T cells (Hornick et al., 2000; Baker et al.,
2001a). Although this antigen presentation pathway becomes
active immediately following transplantation, the initially low
frequency indirect alloresponse is not generally considered to be
of sufficient intensity to be the main stimulus of early or acute
graft rejection in a clinical setting, although in some experimen￾tal models of graft rejection described later it has been shown to
induce acute rejection. Instead, the continuous and progressive
priming of the immune response to indirectly presented alloanti￾gens is thought to gradually amplify effector T cell responses with
indirect allospecificity to culminate in chronic immune-mediated

rejection (Vella et al., 1997; Hornick et al., 2000; Baker et al.,
2001a; Gokmen et al., 2008).
The semi-direct pathway is the most recently described path￾way of antigen presentation and occurs when intact allogeneic
MHC:peptide complexes are captured from donor cell mem￾branes by recipient APCs and incorporated, with maintenance
of sufficient molecular and structural integrity to prime recipient
T cell alloresponses to the direct pathway (Herrera et al., 2004;
Smyth et al., 2006; Riond et al., 2007; Smyth et al., 2007). There
is, therefore, the potential for any given APC to simultaneously
present alloantigen both via the direct and indirect pathways. In
addition to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, a significant
proportion of B lymphocytes have also been shown to acquire
allogeneic MHC molecules, and this process is also now known
to be bidirectional whereby cells of donor origin can also cap￾ture and present recipient derived MHC complexes (Brown et al.,
2008, 2011).
The ability of the semi-direct pathway to link both the direct
and indirect pathways of alloimmune priming of T cell responses
may simplify the matter of selecting an appropriate allospe￾cific Treg to regulate the alloreponse by permitting linked or
bystander suppression by allospecific Treg, a concept which we
return to later. The semi-direct pathway, therefore, illustrates that
neither pathway of alloantigen presentation is mutually exclu￾sive post-transplantation. This is further revealed by studying the
mechanisms, kinetics, and altering intensity of the alloimmune
response.
DYNAMICS OF ALLOANTIGEN PRESENTATION
An important aspect of administering optimized donor-specific
Treg cell therapy is to determine when to deliver their imm￾munoregulatory effects in vivo. A sensible presumption would
be to apply them in advance of or simultaneously to the induc￾tion of alloantigen presentation pathway activities, to counteract
the allopriming effect. Our understanding of the dynamics of the
alloimmune response is provided in part by studying the sur￾vival and trafficking of donor and recipient APCs in vivo but is
also revealed more directly by experimental and clinical studies
reporting on the duration and intensity of both direct and indirect
pathway primed T cell alloresponses following transplantation
(Figure 1B).
The contribution of alloimmune priming by the direct path￾way was first demonstrated by seminal experiments examining
the effects of donor allograft passenger APCs on kidney allo￾graft survival (Lechler and Batchelor, 1982a). Several studies have
since confirmed that abrogation of the direct pathway typically
results in a prolongation of graft survival rather than achieving
an outcome of true tolerance (Garrod et al., 2010; Fernandes
et al., 2011; Gupta et al., 2011), suggesting it is not the only
driver of graft rejection. Due to the clearance of donor passen￾ger APCs, the direct alloresponse it is thought to be a relatively
short-lived (Lechler and Batchelor, 1982a,b; Hornick et al., 1998),
allowing indirect allospecific T effectors responses to dominate.
Clearance of donor APCs has recently been shown to be a highly
efficient process mediated by recipient cytotoxic lymphocytes
(CTLs; Laffont et al., 2006) and natural killer (NK) cell killing,
the latter of which can efficiently remove allogeneic donor APC
introduced by adoptive transfer or by a skin allograft within hours
post-transplantation, to limit any consequent priming of direct
pathway alloreactive effector T cell responses (Laffont et al., 2008;
Garrod et al., 2010). However, the discovery of the semi-direct
pathway implies that the direct pathway is not completely inhib￾ited by this process. Therefore, these data clearly suggest that
targeted approaches to control both the direct pathway, perpet￾uated by the semi-direct pathway, and the indirect pathway may
be better able to deliver tolerance induction.
Recent data supports this view by providing evidence of the
presentation of donor alloantigen by the semi-direct pathway
for prolonged periods post-transplantation. In a rat model of
complete MHC mismatched (LEW→BN) liver transplantation,
Toyokawa et al. were able to detect donor MHC Class II L21-6+
CD11c+ cells within allografted tissues up to 200 days post￾transplantation (Toyokawa et al., 2008), but surprisingly found
they disappeared much earlier when grafts were performed into
recipient animals pre-depleted of macrophage and DC compart￾ments using clodronate liposomes. While the authors speculated
that this early loss of cells expressing donor MHC class II may be
due to lack of a survival advantage conferred by recipient APCs
through microenvironment conditioning, other studies of surface
MHC transfer suggest that the prolonged persistence of donor
MHC expression of CD11c+ cells is more likely to be due to the
semi-direct pathway. In a mouse kidney graft model of spon￾taneous tolerance (DBA-2→C57BL/6), Brown et al. were able
to demonstrate activity of the semi-direct pathway as early as 8
days post-transplantation by counter-staining lymphoid tissues
for both recipient and donor MHC class II expression (Brown
et al., 2008). They were able to detect a surprisingly high propor￾tion of APCs with I-Ad (DBA-2 MHC class II) and I-Ab (C57BL/6
MHC Class II) expression (∼30%), which remained detectable
for extended periods of over 80 days post-transplantation. In the
study by Tokoyawa et al., the semi-direct pathway is, therefore,
a more likely explanation for prolonged direct pathway donor
alloantigen presentation, particularly as in this same study they
also detected upregulation of MHC class II expression by donor
allograft epithelial and endothelial cells during inflammation,
which could have provided a continuous source of donor alloanti￾gen. This would however need to be confirmed by staining for
both donor and recipient MHC expression.
Although CD4+ T cells with direct allospecificity are well
placed to provide help to alloreactive CD8+ T cells, through the
likely 3-cell clusters formed between direct alloreactive CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells interacting with a donor-derived APC expressing
both allogeneic MHC class I and II, there must be an alternative
provision of help for CD8+ T cells, as otherwise the clearance
of donor passenger APCs would result in a parallel reduction
of alloreactive CD8+ CTL responses. This long-standing conun￾drum is partly resolved by demonstration of a helper T cell￾independent mechanism of CD8+ T cell alloactivation (Jones
et al., 2006) and partly by the provision of T cell help via CD4+ T
cells with indirect allospecificity (Lee et al., 1994). Precisely how
an indirect alloreactive CD4+ T cell with self-MHC restriction
would encounter a direct allospecific CD8+ T cell interacting with
a cell expressing intact allogeneic Class I MHC, is resolved by the
semi-direct pathway where an APC can present both allogeneic

class I and processed allopeptides in the context of Class II
self-MHC. Fischer et al. have shown that combining tolerogenic
conditioning of recipient murine DCs through Rapamycin drug
treatment, with DC capture of intact MHC Class I from allogeneic
cell lysates, results in alloantigen presentation via the semi-direct
pathway, and drives regulation of direct alloreactive CD8+ T cell
responses in vitro and in vivo. This study indicates the potential
of this pathway in mediating effective immune regulation as well
as alloimmune priming (Fischer et al., 2011). Whereas presenta￾tion of donor-derived MHC Class I via the semi-direct pathway
may remain sustained, as stable graft function develops through
sustained immunosuppression or developing immune regulatory
processes, presentation of MHC Class II via this pathway may
play a lesser role during the post-transplant period as it’s sources
and activation-induced expression subside with diminution of the
inflammatory microenvironment.
Combined, these data shed an alternative view on the role of
donor APCs in priming the alloresponse early post transplanta￾tion, where their main effect may also be through the provision
of an early and high density source of donor antigen to prime the
indirect and semi-direct pathways. Activity of these two pathways
has recently been demonstrated on a more direct visual basis by
the detection of Yae (antibody with specificity for Class I H2-Kd
peptide presented by I-Ab complex) and MHC class II I-Ad dou￾ble positive APCs within lymphoid tissue of C57BL/6 (H2-Kb)
mice that have received a BALB/c (H2-Kd) heart graft, demon￾strating the capacity of recipient APCs to simultaneously prime
both direct and indirect T cell alloresponses (Brown et al., 2011).
The predominance of alloantigen presentation via the indirect
pathway early in the post-transplantation period in addition to
its more usual role in chronic rejection is now becoming a better
established phenomenon.
In this respect, the contribution of the indirect pathway toward
allograft rejection has been firmly established by studies using
donor grafts from MHC class II−/− mice, where rejection can
be efficiently induced in the complete absence of direct path￾way presentation of alloantigen (Auchincloss et al., 1993; Honjo
et al., 2004). Graft rejection dependent on indirect pathway pre￾sentation of alloantigens or minor antigens is also now well
described (Jurcevic et al., 2001; Sims et al., 2001; Smith et al.,
2001; Fernandes et al., 2011), and can occur with little or no
change (Garrod et al., 2010; Gupta et al., 2011) in the kinetics of
graft rejection compared to when the direct pathway is also active.
In support of these findings Brennan et al. have demonstrated the
efficiency of the indirect pathway compared to the direct path￾way of alloantigen presentation (Brennan et al., 2009). This study
co-transferred murine CD4 and CD8 T cells with TCR trans￾genes conferring specificity for either the direct pathway (I-Ad
and H2-Kd, respectively), or the indirect pathway (H2-Kd:I-Ab
complex) into C57BL/6 mice (I-Ab) which were then challenged
with BALB/c (I-Ad) heart or skin grafts. On adoptive transfer,
T cells with indirect allospecificity proliferated with much more
rapid kinetics compared to T cells with direct specificity, which
was also reflected by endogenous alloreactive T cell populations.
Using a murine transplant model Gupta et al. were able to mea￾sure the kinetics of alloantigen presentation though the direct
or indirect pathways by grafting skin from a BALB/c or CB6F1
(C57BL/6 × BALB/c F1) mouse onto a C57BL/6.TEa.Rag2−/−
recipient mouse, in which the T cells have indirect specificity
for I-E alpha peptide presented by C57BL/6 MHC class II I-Ab
(Gupta et al., 2011). They found that on indirect presentation
alone, where BALB/c donor alloantigens must first be processed
via the indirect pathway for presentation to TEa T cells, rejection
was delayed by 6 days compared to direct antigen presentation
(endogenous expression of I-Eα:I-Ab complex by CB6F1 DCs),
suggesting this short delay was caused by the time lag required for
antigen processing and presentation by the recipient DCs before
subsequent T cell proliferation. Although these findings concur
with the concept that late graft rejection is associated with a
gradually priming and maintenance of the indirect pathway, they
fundamentally differ from the findings by Brennan et al., however
these differences may be attributed to the allograft model or TCR
transgenic T cells used, suggesting although these models are ideal
for dissecting mechanistic basis of alloimmune priming, examin￾ing clinical data may be more informative for developing practical
therapeutic strategies for intervention.
IMPLICATIONS FOR DONOR-SPECIFIC TREG THERAPY
The experimental findings described above underpin two main
features of alloimmunity, firstly that the indirect pathway is
active immediately following transplantation and secondly that
the direct pathway can contribute toward the maintenance of
the indirect pathway and may be active later in the post￾transplantation period through the semi-direct pathway. It may,
therefore, be tempting to speculate that Treg therapy would be
best applied either pre-transplantation or at the time of trans￾plantation to prevent any initial priming of memory alloreactive
T cell responses, perhaps through modulation of APC activities
(Misra et al., 2004; Mahnke et al., 2007; Herman et al., 2012).
However, several recent studies have demonstrated that mainte￾nance of alloantigen presentation throughout the lifetime of the
organ transplant is also key to achieving tolerance, particularly so
when mechanistically Tregs are involved.
Chiffoleau et al. have shown that a rat model of donor￾specific heart transplant tolerance (fully MHC mismatched
LEW.1W→LEW.1A) is associated with an expansion of splenic
Tregs. In parallel, the study detected the persistence and even
proliferation (possibly a consequence of the deoxyspergualin
analogue tolerising protocol used) of donor DCs for over 100
days post-transplantation, which were restricted to the allo￾grafted tissue, achieving a localized tissue chimerism (Chiffoleau
et al., 2002). Interestingly, this group found that pre-depletion
of donor APCs from the heart allograft prior to transplanta￾tion by cyclophosphamide treatment, resulted in a reduction in
splenic Tregs and abrogation of the tolerogenic effect. In vitro
analysis further confirmed that CD4+ T cells from tolerised ani￾mals showed direct pathway donor-specific suppressive activity.
Therefore, using this particular tolerising protocol, alloantigen
presentation via the direct pathway was critical for induction of
transplant tolerance and generation of donor-specific Tregs, sug￾gesting this may be mechanistically a critical contributor toward
the successful approach of using mixed-chimerism to induce tol￾erance to a solid organ transplant (Ko et al., 1999b; Andreola et al.,
2011).
www.frontiersin.org July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 184 | 5

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
Several other studies have also shown that persistent presen￾tation of donor alloantigen is also essential for the maintenance
of solid organ transplant tolerance in rodent models. Hamano
et al. showed that stable tolerance of a murine allogeneic heart
graft induced by anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies and donor￾specific transfusion (DST) was lost when second donor-matched
hearts were transplanted 200 days after the removal of the pri￾mary hearts, that is, once all donor-alloantigen had been cleared
from the recipient mouse (Hamano et al., 1996). This implies
that unlike the study by Chiffoleau et al., donor-microchimerism
through the survival of donor APCs is not essential for mainte￾nance of tolerance (Ko et al., 1999a), but rather that activation
of semi-direct or indirect pathways of alloantigen presentation,
by any source of alloantigen, may be more critical. This the￾ory corresponds with evidence of the requirement of continuous
presence of donor alloantigens for Treg survival in allograft tol￾erance models (Scully et al., 1994; Chen et al., 1996; Hamano
et al., 1996). Two recent studies add further support to this con￾cept by using miniature swine models of allotransplantation to
study the stability of tolerance and the contribution of alloanti￾gen presentation via the indirect pathway toward maintenance of
tolerance (Okumi et al., 2008; Weiss et al., 2009). Okumi et al.
were able to demonstrate that once a primary MHC class I mis￾matched tolerised kidney allograft had been removed and all
endogenous donor alloantigen had been cleared, animals could
be sensitized to reject a second identical donor graft by injec￾tion of donor MHC Class I peptides. However, immunization
of long-term tolerised animals with donor MHC Class I pep￾tides did not lead to the rejection of a primary graft, indicating
that alloantigen presentation via the indirect pathway could both
break tolerance and be crucial in the induction and maintenance
of tolerance.
The relevance of these studies toward developing Treg therapy
is challenging to conclude, largely because of the intricacies and
variation within each experimental model, with respect to trans￾genic mice used or tolerising protocols applied, which may or not
be associated with Treg mediated regulatory processes. What can
be deduced is that for induction of long-term stable graft toler￾ance, active presentation of alloantigen is required, which over the
life-time of an allograft will be mediated primarily by the indi￾rect pathway. Sustained alloantigen presentation may function
by promoting antigen-driven activation, expansion, or survival
of in vivo induced or adoptively transferred donor-specific Tregs
(Walker et al., 2003; Sanchez-Fueyo et al., 2006), which may in
turn stimulate other alloantigen-specific immune regulatory pro￾cesses, a concept which is explored in more detail in the following
section.
DONOR-SPECIFIC TREG CONTROL OF ALLOIMMUNE
RESPONSES FOLLOWING TRANSPLANTATION
As well as their critical role in immune homeostasis and regu￾lation of autoimmunity (Sakaguchi and Sakaguchi, 2005), Tregs
can function to regulate the alloimmune response through
a number of mechanisms which include release of immuno￾suppressive cytokines, modulation of APC and endothelial
functions, or direct suppression of CD8+ and CD4+ T effec￾tor cells to summarize but a few (Shevach, 2009). Here we
examine the requirements of Tregs to control several important
aspects of the alloimmune effector response, outlining where the
advantages of donor-specific Treg use for immune regulation
may lie.
DONOR-SPECIFIC TREGS DELIVER LOCALISED IMMUNE REGULATION
Targeting the immunoregulatory properties of Tregs to the sites
of anti-donor effector responses would circumvent the issue of
the relative paucity of Tregs, which would otherwise limit their
efficacy in vivo. The effector arm of the indirect alloresponse is
broad and can occur at remote sites to the donor allograft as dis￾cussed later, however as indirect allospecific T cells are unable
to recognize the tissue allograft directly to mediate direct lysis
or cell mediated immunity, that is in a completely MHC mis￾matched donor recipient setting, they would only potentially
be able to directly damage the allograft by bystander killing.
In contrast, direct allospecific T cells accumulate and act at
the graft site through recognition of expressed intact MHC. An
immediate advantage of transferring Tregs with direct pathway
alloantigen-specificity would, therefore, be that they would natu￾rally localize to the equivalent site of allospecific effector T cell
priming to mediate their regulatory effects. Indeed, Tregs have
been described to specifically accumulate at sites of alloantigen
sources, alloimmune effector priming or target activity, to estab￾lish a state of local immune privilege (Golshayan et al., 2007, 2009;
Dijke et al., 2008). In experimental models of allograft tolerance,
Tregs with the ability to transfer tolerance to naive recipients have
also been detected within draining lymph nodes and also donor
allografted tissue (Graca et al., 2002). In a recent study by Heslan
et al., analysis of T cells isolated from tolerised allografts, also
capable of transferring donor-specific tolerance to naive recipi￾ents, showed skewed TCR Vβ repertoires which may reflect an
accumulation of oligioclonal donor alloantigen specific regula￾tory T cells (Heslan et al., 2005). What many studies have been
unable to demonstrate is whether Tregs are generated elsewhere
and then migrate to the graft site from the periphery or whether
they are induced within an allografted tissue itself. However these
studies do highlight the major advantage offered by a therapeutic
strategy to adoptively transfer donor-specific Tregs into trans￾plant recipients, by allowing their immunomodulatory functions
to be readily concentrated at the source of their cognate alloanti￾gen expression and subsequent immune activation (Golshayan
et al., 2007). We have recently demonstrated that transfer of
human Tregs selected for direct pathway donor allospecificity are
more effective at preventing rejection of a human skin graft in
a humanized mouse xenograft model, compared to polyclonal
Tregs (Sagoo et al., 2011). On studying early trafficking of adop￾tively transferred human Tregs (3 days), similar numbers of both
allospecific and polyclonal Tregs were recruited to skin allografts,
although a higher proportion of allospecific Tregs were found to
be in contact with skin resident alloantigen (HLA-DR+) bear￾ing donor cells. These data allow speculation that donor-specific
Treg mediated suppression occurs primarily at sites of alloantigen
expression and effector target tissue, and possibly acts through
early interaction and modulation of APC function and effector
cell recruitment, as implicated by other in vitro and in vivo studies
(Golshayan et al., 2009; Herman et al., 2012). Analysis at later time

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
points (4 weeks) showed significantly higher numbers of allospe￾cific Tregs were present in allografted tissues, which concurs
with the hypothesis that antigen-driven expansion or survival
of allospecific Tregs had occurred (Walker et al., 2003; Sanchez￾Fueyo et al., 2006), and which may contribute to the improved
efficacy of donor-specific Tregs in this model. These findings also
resonate with functional differences detected between antigen￾specific and polyclonal Tregs in other murine models of tolerance
induction (Golshayan et al., 2007; Joffre et al., 2008; Tsang et al.,
2009). In contrast, considerable success using polyclonal Tregs in
preventing experimental graft versus host disease (GvHD) has
also been demonstrated (Edinger et al., 2003; Trenado et al.,
2003). The disparity between the relative efficacy of polyclonal
Tregs in these transplantation settings may again be related to
the localization of alloreactive responses, which during GvHD
is more systemic and, therefore, equally amenable for polyclonal
Treg mediated regulation.
The frequency and distribution of Tregs have also been stud￾ied in the context of clinical transplantation both in observa￾tional/association studies, and also in several studies extending
to cellular function analysis of Treg mediated suppression, the
latter of which is discussed later. As summarized in Table 1
(Columns A and C), several studies examining clinically stable
allograft recipients, those undergoing rejection, and healthy “con￾trol” individuals, in general find no consistent differences in the
frequencies of peripheral blood circulating levels of Tregs. Shan
et al. (2011) have recently compiled a more comprehensive review
of over 20 observational clinical studies which have examined
the association of detected human Tregs with liver, heart, lung,
and kidney allograft outcome. Their meta-analysis shows that ele￾vated intra-graft Tregs detected by relative increase in FoxP3+
cells or quantitative mRNA expression expression could, in gen￾eral, be positively correlated with improved graft function or
outcome, whereas numbers of circulating Tregs, the most com￾mon method of analysis, could not be consistently correlated with
outcome. This finding again reinforces the concept of targeting
Tregs to the correct in vivo site for optimal alloimmune sup￾pression. This is further supported by a study by Bestard et al.
which found that renal transplant patients whom developed T cell
hyporesponsiveness toward their donor after transplantation also
had significantly higher levels of CD4+FoxP3+ cells within their
allograft infiltrates compared to patients whom showed donor￾reactivity (Bestard et al., 2007). Similar observations of elevated
foxp3 mRNA expression in allograft biopsies have also been made
in combined bone marrow transplant (BMT) and kidney allograft
patients whom develop operational tolerance (Kawai et al., 2008).
Indeed, studies of human Tregs in patients with operational
tolerance are more revealing and in general bode well for cell ther￾apy approaches aiming to increase in vivo Treg numbers (Table 2,
Column A). Several studies have detected increases in percent￾ages of CD4+CD25+ Tregs as a proportion of total CD4+ T cells
and also absolute numbers of Tregs in peripheral blood circula￾tion in tolerant liver transplant recipients compared to healthy
controls, patients with stable graft function whom are maintained
on immunosuppressive drugs, and patients with active immune￾mediated graft rejection (Li et al., 2004, 2008; Martinez-Llordella
et al., 2007; Pons et al., 2008). Li et al. have further confirmed
that higher percentages of FoxP3+ cells are also detected in
biopsy material from some tolerant liver transplant patients (Li
et al., 2008). More recently, expansion of in vivo numbers of cir￾culating Tregs has been strongly linked to immunosuppression
withdrawal protocols and establishment of tolerance in cohorts
of liver transplant recipients (Nafady-Hego et al., 2010). The
association of Tregs with operational tolerance in other organs
such as kidney is not as consistent, with the majority of studies
observing that tolerant patients do not have higher percentages
or absolute number of Tregs in circulation compared to other
patient groups described (Louis et al., 2006; Braudeau et al.,
2007; Newell et al., 2010; Sagoo et al., 2010). In two recent stud￾ies examining the largest cohorts of renal transplant patients
with established long-term operational tolerance to date, neither
study detected expansion of CD4+CD25high Tregs in peripheral
blood (Newell et al., 2010; Sagoo et al., 2010). While all clin￾ical studies of renal transplant recipients described in Table 2
identified no differences in percentages or numbers of circu￾latory Tregs between tolerant individuals and healthy control
subjects, two studies did detect a significant reduction of Tregs in
patients with chronic graft rejection (Louis et al., 2006; Braudeau
et al., 2007). This observation suggests that tolerance may not
be directly related to a numerical advantage in peripheral Tregs,
more rather that tolerant individuals may maintain Tregs num￾bers similar to that of healthy individuals, whereas reduced Treg
numbers may be associated with poor graft outcome. This dif￾ference may of course be a consequence of patients whom go
on to develop chronic rejection having lower pre-transplant fre￾quencies of Tregs, which is an important question that can be
examined by the prospective and longitudinal immune mon￾itoring of transplant recipients. Reviewing the clinical studies
of operational tolerance summarized in Table 2 highlights an
emerging dichotomy between liver and kidney transplantation
and the differing role of circulatory Tregs within each organ trans￾plant setting. This deserves further investigation and warrants
deeper phenotypic and functional analysis, particularly in view
of some divergence in genetic profiles of immunological toler￾ance that have recently been identified between these two organs
(Martinez-Llordella et al., 2008; Perucha et al., 2011; Sawitzki
et al., 2011).
As suggested earlier, analysis of Treg frequencies in peripheral
blood may be entirely perfunctory, and may not be indica￾tive of allograft infiltrating Tregs or active mechanisms of reg￾ulation taking place within the tissue. Interestingly, despite
observing no differences in peripheral blood Treg numbers
between patient study groups, by studying urine sediment,
which is anticipated to be reflective of the cellular composi￾tion of the kidney allograft, Newel et al. were able to detect
higher foxp3 expression by operationally tolerant patients com￾pared to healthy control subjects, highlighting the subtleties of
immunological monitoring that need to be considered when
interpreting observations in clinical transplantation (Newell
et al., 2010). Although intragraft Treg composition is challeng￾ing to measure directly, an intermediate method of assessing the
role of Tregs and immune regulation in tolerance is through
the detection of donor-specific hyporesponsiveness by allograft
recipients.

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
EVIDENCE FOR DONOR-SPECIFIC TREG-MEDIATED REGULATION
OF ALLOIMMUNITY
Measuring recipient alloreactivity toward donor antigen pre￾sented by the direct or indirect pathways has been achieved using
several ex vivo methods as summarized in Tables 1 (Column A)
and 2 (Column B), and has evidenced that detectable active
donor-reactive immunity is in general correlated with poor graft
outcome and development of acute and chronic graft rejec￾tion, respectively (Table 1 Column B and Table 2 Column C;
Vella et al., 1997; Ciubotariu et al., 1998; Poggio et al., 2004;
Hernandez-Fuentes and Lechler, 2005). Furthermore, by com￾paring recipient T cell responder frequencies against donor
stimulation to that of HLA mismatched third party (3rdParty)
stimulation, it can be used as a method to detect donor￾specific hyporesponsiveness and, therefore, determine whether
established stable graft function or immunological tolerance
is alloantigen-specific. Monitoring of donor-reactive immune
responses has demonstrated that hyporesponsiveness to the direct
pathway can develop shortly after solid organ transplantation and
is in general associated with stable graft function (Hornick et al.,
1998; De Haan et al., 2000). Donor-specific cytotoxic or T cell
hyporesponsiveness has been detected in kidney (Ghobrial et al.,
1994; Mason et al., 1996; Mestre et al., 1996; Hornick et al., 1998;
Baker et al., 2001b), heart (Hu et al., 1994; Hornick et al., 2000;
Van Hoffen et al., 2000) and lung (De Haan et al., 2000) trans￾plantation, although this is not a universal finding (Eberspacher
et al., 1994; Loonen et al., 1994; Steinmann et al., 1994; Oei
et al., 2000). In addition, hyporesponsivessness to donor anti￾gen presented by the indirect pathway has also been described
(Salama et al., 2003b). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the contri￾bution of Tregs toward regulation of donor alloreactivity can be
measured by the recovery of effector functions or proliferation
when Tregs are removed or added into an assay in which donor
alloantigen is used as a stimulator of either the direct or indi￾rect T cell alloresponse. Again, comparison of suppressive activity
toward a 3rdParty stimulator can further reveal whether Tregs
have alloantigen-specific suppressive functions.
Our review of clinical studies which have examined the con￾tribution of Tregs toward established donor-hyporesponsiveness
shows a high degree of concordance in demonstrating donor￾specific Treg mediated suppression of T cell alloreactivity toward
direct (Velthuis et al., 2006, 2007; Bestard et al., 2007; Kreijveld
et al., 2007; Akl et al., 2008; Sewgobind et al., 2008; Hendrikx
et al., 2009) and indirect (Salama et al., 2003b; Spadafora-Ferreira
et al., 2007) pathway anti-donor responses in patients with sta￾ble allograft function. Two of these studies were prospective and
were, therefore, able to show that donor-specific Treg activity
with direct pathway specificity developed relatively early on post
transplantation from 6 months onwards (Bestard et al., 2007;
Hendrikx et al., 2009). Within the studies examined the per￾centage of stable allograft recipients with detectable evidence of
donor-specific Treg functions ranged from 20 to 83% of donor￾hyporesponsive patients between study cohorts. Some studies
however, were either unable to detect any donor-specific T cell
hyporesponsiveness (Baan et al., 2007), or unable to uncover
any donor-specific Treg activity despite patients showing donor￾specific T cell hyporesponses to direct pathway donor stimulation
(Game et al., 2003). These variations may be in part explained
by the differing immunocompetence and immune status between
individual patients and within patient cohorts based on their
pre- and post-transplant immunosuppressive regimens, or sim￾ply technical peculiarities of the assays performed. Incongruence’s
may also be influenced by differences in time post-transplantation
that patients were screened for donor-specific Treg activity,
where in addition to Tregs, other more dominant donor-specific
immunoregulatory mechanisms may be actively contributing
toward the detected dampening of anti-donor responses.
In support of this latter hypothesis, a study examining regu￾lation of direct pathway alloreactivity in tolerant liver transplant
recipients (Yoshizawa et al., 2005), suggests that donor alloanti￾gen specific Treg activity is one of multiple mechanisms that may
contribute to the maintenance of liver graft survival. Yoshizawa
et al. were able to detect an increase in donor-directed alloreac￾tivity after depletion of Tregs from in vitro MLR assays, however
tolerant recipient T cells still remained largely hyporesponsive to
donor stimulation suggesting other mechanisms such as clonal
deletion, induction of donor-specific cell anergy or involvement
of other immunomodulatory cell subsets were established during
tolerance. Further evidence for this is provided by work from our
group as part of the Indices of Tolerance and Riset consortium,
where we were able to correlate direct pathway donor-specific
hyporesponsiveness with tolerance in renal transplant patients,
but this could not be attributed to CD4+CD25+ Treg mediated
donor-specific functions by ex vivo analysis (Sagoo et al., 2010).
As increased numbers of Tregs were more strongly associated
with operational tolerance in liver transplantation as described
earlier, the findings by Nafady-Hego et al. may be readily antic￾ipated (Nafady-Hego et al., 2010). In their ex vivo functional
assays to study donor-specific Treg suppression, Nafady et al.
found that only the patient cohort with established tolerance
demonstrated donor-specific Treg mediated regulation of donor￾directed T cell alloresponses, with patients undergoing active
weaning showing a similar emerging although not significant
effect.
Drawing any firm conclusions from these findings is a chal￾lenge as very few studies to date have directly assessed Treg
activity in clinical transplantation tolerance. However, the data
reviewed in Tables 1 (Columns B and C) and 2 (Columns C
and D) clearly indicate that donor-specific hyporesonsivess to
the direct and indirect pathways of alloantigen presentation are
features of stable graft function and also operational tolerance.
Furthermore they suggest that naturally occurring Tregs may play
a prominent role in the establishment and possibly maintenance
of donor-specific immunological tolerance in liver transplanta￾tion. This is an important aspect which can only be assessed by
clinical studies which perform longitudinal immune monitoring
of transplant recipients during immunosuppression weaning pro￾tocols as is more routinely performed in liver transplantation. In
contrast, while in kidney transplantation Tregs with direct path￾way donor-specificity appear to contribute toward suppression
of donor-specific responses during stable graft function or the
phase of tolerance induction, they do not appear to play a promi￾nent role in toward the maintenance of established operational
tolerance.

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
Although there is evidence of Treg-mediated regulation of
indirect pathway directed anti-donor responses in stable renal
transplant patients (Salama et al., 2003a), clinical studies of oper￾ational tolerance suggest that maintenance of the immunological
donor-specific hyporesponsive state can also be attributed to
other immuoregulatory processes than naturally occurring Tregs.
Several years ago, VanBuskirk et al. were able to demonstrate
that some patients displaying stable tolerance to either a kid￾ney or liver allograft had evidence of donor-specific regulation
of indirect pathway T cell responses. This was detected using
a trans-vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) linked sup￾pression assay, measuring DTH swelling responses to tetanus
toxin recall antigen stimulation when applied with or without
donor antigen (VanBuskirk et al., 2000). This study identified
regulation of donor-specific responses was dependent on either
IL-10 or TGFβ, although no further analysis of the mechanis￾tic basis or source of either cytokine was studied. Following on
from this work, Haynes et al., have recently been able to corre￾late both reduced T cell responses to indirectly presented donor
alloantigens and evidence of active regulation of indirect allore￾activity with improved kidney transplant outcome (Haynes et al.,
2012). Again using the trans-vivo DTH assay, they were able to
show that tolerant patients had reduced donor-specific T cells
responses with reactivity toward indirectly presented donor anti￾gens, which were actively regulated through a TGF-β dependent
mechanism detected using an in vivo linked suppression assay.
Although again, immune regulation was not directly attributed to
antigen-specific naturally occurring FoxP3+ Tregs or any partic￾ular lymphocyte subset, this certainly implies a role for adaptive
or induced Th3 Treg mediated regulation, by CD4 or possibly
CD8 T cell subsets. In this study, the importance of alloimmune
priming and immune regulation of the indirect pathway for tol￾erance induction was also very clearly illustrated by the complete
absence of indirect pathway alloresponses detected in identical
twins receiving isogenic kidney transplants. Haynes et al. also
performed a parallel assessment of other kidney graft patients
including those with stable graft function and those undergoing
chronic rejection, and showed a progressive spectrum of immune
responses to the indirect pathway and the degree of active regu￾lation of this alloresponse, associated with graft function, where
patients with biopsy proven chronic rejection had the highest level
of indirect alloreactivity, with the lowest regulatory ability.
These studies highlight the significance of active processes of
regulation of the indirect pathway of alloantigen presentation in
tolerance, suggesting that deletion may not be the primary mech￾anism involved, however they did not examine and, therefore,
exclude the role of naturally occurring CD4+CD25highFoxP3+
Tregs, either their direct suppressive activities or their ability to
mediate linked suppression and thereby induce alternative net￾works of immunomodulatory cells. Indeed, the clinical studies
of operational tolerance reviewed here are all restricted by their
assessment of only limited immunoregulatory cellular pheno￾types or mechanisms. Nonetheless, what can be inferred from
these studies is that in both liver and kidney transplantation tol￾erance, naturally occurring Tregs with donor-specificity may be
related to immune regulation of the alloresponses early post￾transplantation, to induce transplantation tolerance. There then
appears to be some divergence between allografted tissues which
requires further investigation, however current data suggests that
in operational kidney transplantation tolerance, immunoregula￾tion mediated by Tregs does not remain a dominant mechanism.
An emerging hypothesis is, therefore, that Tregs with indirect
allospecificity may induce other immunosuppressive mechanisms
through linked or bystander suppression to generate infectious
tolerance which are involved in maintenance of the tolerant state.
We can find evidence to support this hypothesis by examining
the mechanisms and immunological factors identified follow￾ing experimental and clinical transplantation tolerance induction
protocols.
LESSONS ON RELEVANCE OF DONOR-SPECIFIC TREGS FROM
TOLERANCE INDUCTION PROTOCOLS
Linked suppression is a feature of immune regulation which can
be elicited by Tregs with indirect allospecificity, whereby a Treg
can encounter an APC presenting its specific MHC:peptide com￾plex and can exert suppression upon other T cell responses, with
specificity for other unrelated antigens also presented by the
same APC, namely via the indirect pathway (Chen et al., 1996;
Wise et al., 1998; Niimi et al., 2001). Mechanistically, linked sup￾pression is achieved through many of the classical suppressive
functions of Tregs described, such as modulation of APC func￾tions to generate tolerogenic functions, Treg-T cell competition
for space or ligands on the APC both of which can result in
anergy, or local production of immunosuppressive cytokines or
factors which modulate lymphocyte functions (Qin et al., 1993;
Waldmann et al., 2006). In addition to induction of adaptive
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, these mechanisms may result in the
generation of other immunomodulatory cell subsets, such as the
recently described CD8+CD28− suppressor T cells (Suciu-Foca
et al., 2003), Tr1 cells (Battaglia et al., 2006), or Th3 cells, the
importance of which has been further underlined in transplan￾tation tolerance by recent work from the Burlingham research
group described earlier (VanBuskirk et al., 2000; Haynes et al.,
2012). The presence of donor-specific Tregs may, therefore, act to
dampen the inflammatory alloimmune response early on post￾transplantation by suppressing alloimmune T effector responses
for induction of transplantation tolerance. Once a tolerogenic
environment is established in vivo, subsequent antigen presenta￾tion may occur predominantly via the indirect pathway within a
tolerogenic environment, and depending on the degree of HLA
mismatching, resulting in the expansion of naturally occurring
Tregs, or the induction of adaptive or induced Treg populations,
such as the Th3 to propagate infectious tolerance and maintain
an operational tolerant state. This may explain the incongruence
between clinical studies that have examined the presence and
activities of Tregs with direct pathway allospecificity during the
late transplantation period. Although it remains to be formally
demonstrated in a clinical setting, several studies have implicated
a direct link between Tregs and induction of other immunoreg￾ulatory processes, which is emphasized by the persistence of the
indirect pathway and indirect allospecific Treg functions.
Review of experimental tolerance induction strategies have
shown that in addition to clonal deletion, anergy and exhaus￾tion, immune regulation mediated by Tregs form a common

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
mechanistic basis in achieving indefinite graft survival, partic￾ularly using methods such as DST, tolerogenic DCs and also
costimulatory blockade (Sykes, 2007). Many tolerance induc￾tion protocols have been shown to require active presentation of
alloantigen through the indirect pathway (Yamada et al., 2001;
Niederkorn and Mayhew, 2002; Rulifson et al., 2002). This cor￾responds to studies of allograft tolerance in mice, where Tregs
have been described as being generated by indirect presentation,
which can then exert their suppressive properties against donor
alloantigen presented by the indirect pathway (Wise et al., 1998;
Hara et al., 2001). Also as mentioned previously, the detection of
effective immune regulation of donor alloreactivity to the indi￾rect pathway in clinical studies is correlated with stable graft
function and tolerance. As several studies have indicated that
thymically derived naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Tregs have
a higher propensity for recognition of self-MHC and thus indi￾rect allospecificity (Jordan et al., 2001; Apostolou et al., 2002;
Romagnoli et al., 2002; Hsieh et al., 2004), it is, therefore, con￾ceivable that presentation of alloantigen by the indirect pathway
following transplantation results in the preferential activation and
expansion of Tregs with indirect allospecificity. This may in part
explain their improved efficacy in experimental models of indirect
pathway antigen presentation compared to direct pathway antigen
presentation (Sanchez-Fueyo et al., 2007), and support their role
in the early induction phase of transplantation tolerance.
The requirement of the indirect pathway and the role of
Tregs in tolerance induction are heavily implicated by tolerance
induction protocols using DST or hematopoietic stem cell trans￾plantation (HSCT) in experimental and clinical transplantation
(Kishimoto et al., 2004). Generation of mixed chimerism as an
approach to achieve tolerance to a solid organ transplant aims
to generate both peripheral and central tolerance to the allo￾graft, and has recently been extensively reviewed by Pasquet et al.
(2011). Establishing mixed chimerism creates an in vivo situation
where alloantigen presentation via the indirect pathway is signif￾icantly potentiated in activity and intensity and may, therefore,
be more permissive to the promotion of indirect allospecific
Tregs and tolerance induction. Le Guern et al. have provided
experimental data which links the mixed chimerism approach for
tolerance induction, with Treg induction and linked suppression.
In a murine model of fully mismatched heart transplantation
(C57BL/6→ CBA), recipient mice received an autologous BMT
(I-Ak+) which had been retrovirally transduced to express a single
donor MHC Class II donor allele (I-Ab), followed by a donor or
3rdParty heart allograft. This protocol resulted in the induction
of donor-specific tolerance, in the complete absence of sustained
immunosuppression, which was associated with immune devi￾ation from a Th1 to Th2 predominate cytokine response and
with no indications of chronic rejection associated vasculopathy
(LeGuern, 2004; LeGuern et al., 2010). Furthermore, they were
able to transfer protection against graft rejection to naïve recipients
through CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs isolated from tolerant mice.
An impressive Phase II clinical study by Leventhal et al. (2012)
has employed the mixed chimerism approach to show induc￾tion of stable operational tolerance in all their study patients
that underwent HLA-mismatched combined HSCT and kid￾ney transplantation. This study used a protocol which included
transfer of pre-plasmacytoid tolerogenic DC graft facilitating cells
in addition to HSC donor inoculum, which by in vitro and
in experimental in vivo research had previously been shown to
mediate induction of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ donor-specific Tregs.
In patients whom developed durable chimerism, an increase in
the ratio of Tregs to T effectors was detected, along with lack
of donor alloreactivity toward the recipient, which may explain
the absence of GvHD within the cohort. An additional obser￾vation, which we discuss later, was the expansion of CD19+
B cells by a large proportion of the patients, occurring within
the first year post-transplantation. Based on detectable responses
to 3rd Party alloantigens in vitro, it is likely that established
donor-specific immune modulation in these patients was mech￾anistically linked to the induction of donor-specific Tregs. In
another study of combined BMT and kidney transplantation
in HLA-mismatched individuals, Tregs were found to play a
more dominant role early post-transplantation, being expanded
in numbers in the periphery and demonstrating the development
of donor-specific suppressive activity compared to pre-transplant
function. However at 6–12 months post-transplantation, only
some study patients displayed evidence of donor-specific suppres￾sion by Tregs, which was no longer detectable after 1 year, despite
the maintenance of donor-specific hyporesponsiveness. This sug￾gests other forms of immune regulation such as antigen-specific
T effector cell depletion or anergy may have evolved to maintain
allograft tolerance (Andreola et al., 2011). These studies sug￾gest that maintenance of established tolerance may be manifested
through CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg dependent or independent
activity, which may act in concert with or independent of several
other induced immunomodulatory mechanisms.
The use of donor-specific Tregs for transplantation
immunotherapy, therefore, provides an opportunity for the
generation of infectious tolerance and as such, an improved
likelihood of developing stable long-term donor-specific unre￾sponsiveness (Cobbold and Waldmann, 1998; Waldmann et al.,
2006). We next explore the concept of linked suppression in
the context of the improved capacity of donor-specific Tregs to
mediate maintenance of tolerance induction.
DONOR-SPECIFIC TREGS AND CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATION
THROUGH LINKED SUPPRESSION
As described, a key advantage of immunotherapy using Tregs
with indirect donor allospecificity is that they have the capacity
to mediate linked suppression. This allows them to exert control
over broader effector arms of the alloimmune response, which is
particularly relevant for the control of alloantigen-specific B cells
of the alloimmune response.
One of the main effector mechanisms of alloreactive T cells
with indirect allospecificity is through the provision of T cell help
to B cells, which results in the generation of the humoral alloan￾tibody response to an allograft (Suciu-Foca et al., 1995; Colvin,
2007), and leads to alloantibody mediated chronic graft rejection.
The dominant role of T cells with indirect pathway allospeci￾ficity in providing germinal center help to B cells for alloantibody
induction and graft rejection has recently been firmly established.
By adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells with indirect allospeci￾ficity (BALB/c Class I H2-Kd molecule presented in the context
www.frontiersin.org July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 184 | 17

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
of C57BL/6 class II I-Ab) or T cells with direct allospecificity
(CD4+ T cells with direct specificity for I-Abm12), Conlon et al.,
were able demonstrate that only T cells with indirect allospeci￾ficity had the capacity to provide B cell help and induce an
alloantibody response to a heart allograft (BALB/c→C57BL/6),
whereas T cells with direct allospecificity alone were incapable
(BALB/cxBM12→C57BL/6; Taylor et al., 2007; Conlon et al.,
2012). Interactions between cognate T cells and B cells, recog￾nizing different allogeneic peptides presented by the same APC
also promotes epitope spreading of the T cell and alloantibody
responses, resulting in the recognition and alloimmune target￾ing of effector responses to more cryptic antigenic determinates
over the lifetime of the transplant. This correlates with the main
pathological markers of chronic rejection which are typically that
of wound healing such as fibrosis or vasculitis, where proin￾flammatory cytokines generated by antibody-mediated comple￾ment or cellular dependent mechanisms of allograft damage,
induce endothelial and epithelial hyperproliferation. Indeed in
clinical transplantation, epitope spreading has been detected
in patients with detectable indirect pathway T cell alloreactiv￾ity with evidence of chronic allograft dysfunction (Vella et al.,
1997; Ciubotariu et al., 1998; Suciu-Foca et al., 1998; Hornick
et al., 2000). Previous work from our laboratory has demon￾strated the unique capacity of Tregs with indirect allospecificity
to control alloantibody mediated vasculopathy in experimental
heart and skin graft models (Tsang et al., 2009). Using both
MHC-mismatched and semi-allogeneic transplantation models,
Tregs generated with both direct- and indirect pathway allospeci￾ficities were found to be more effective at inducing indefinite
survival of heart transplants than Treg cell lines generated for
direct allospecificity alone. Whilst Tregs with allospecificity for
the direct pathway were only marginally less effective at inducing
indefinite graft survival compared to Tregs with both direct and
indirect pathway allospecificities, Tregs with indirect allospeci￾ficity were essential to prevent chronic vasculopathy, determined
by allograft histopathology. These findings correspond to clinical
observations, where Tregs with indirect pathway donor-specific
suppressive activity in stable renal transplant recipients have been
shown to be able to regulate a shift in recipient alloreactivity to
different donor MHC epitopes during the post-transplant period
(Salama et al., 2003b).
These data clearly argue that development of Tregs with donor￾specificity for the indirect pathway as a cell therapy product
for transplant recipients is likely to be critical for the induction
of long-term graft survival, enabling immunoregulatory mech￾anisms to adapt to the evolving immune response through the
ability of Tregs to control epitope spreading through linked￾suppression. Recipient B cell presentation of donor graft alloanti￾gens is now known to make a critical contribution toward graft
rejection (Noorchashm et al., 2006). As only Tregs with indirect
specificity would have the capability of interacting directly with
its cognate MHC: donor allopeptide complex as presented by a B
cell, it would, therefore, have the potential to modulate the B cell
alloresponse. Treg-mediated modulation of B cell activity has
been evidenced in a previous study of MHC class I mismatched
heart allograft rejection mediated by the indirect pathway, where
graft rejection, induced specifically via CD4+ T cell dependent
induction of alloantibody, was prevented using a tolerance induc￾tion protocol of anti-CD4 and DST, which was shown to generate
Tregs with indirect allospecificity with the capacity to suppress
alloantibody generation (Callaghan et al., 2007).
In addition to the indirect regulatory T cell effect on B cell
activity, through inhibition of helper T cell activity, Tregs have
also been shown to modulate B cell activity through a num￾ber of direct suppressive mechanisms. For example, antigen￾specific murine Tregs raised against a common allergen, through
in vivo administration of an immunodominant peptide, have
been shown to mediate B cell killing on recognition of specific
epitope:MHC complexes through Treg cytolytic activity of Fas￾Fas-L interactions (Janssens et al., 2003). Lim et al. (2004) have
shown that on antigen-mediated activation, Tregs can modulate
their expression of germinal center (GC) B cell follicular zone
homing chemokine receptors (increase CXCR5, decrease CCR7)
and migrate to the T cell B cell boundary areas within human
lymphoid tissue, where they can then directly prevent B cell class
switching and Ig production (Lim et al., 2005). This latter study
went further and by isolating Tregs and B cells from human lym￾phoid tissue, were able to demonstrate that Tregs were not only
able to directly suppress B cell class switching, detected by mon￾itoring Ig transcript analysis in ex vivo transwell assays, but were
also able to suppress the helper T cell response, by preventing
CXCL13 secretion. More recent studies in mouse have shown that
naturally occurring Tregs can migrate and reside in the GC follic￾ular zone where they regulate B cell humoral responses, and that
inhibiting their migration to these zones (using B cells derived
from CXCR5−/− mice) results in aberrant B cell IgM, IgA, IgG1,
and IgG2b antibody production (Wollenberg et al., 2011). More
recently experimental evidence suggests that Tregs may also have
the capacity to protect pre-sensitized individuals, through their
ability to control plasma B cell activity (Jang et al., 2011). Tregs
are, therefore, key in preventing B cell mediated graft destruc￾tion and limiting indirect alloimmunity, which correlates with an
absence of donor-specific alloantibody in clinical transplantation
tolerance and experimental models of transplantation tolerance.
Although the classic view of B cells in transplantation has
focused on their pathogenic activities, an alternative emerging
view is that of the complimentary roles of Regulatory B cells
(Bregs) and Tregs. Bregs have recently been identified to play roles
in regulating autoimmunity in experimental models of collagen￾induced arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)
and colitis, which is associated with B cell production of IL-10
(BR1 or B10 cells in human or mouse respectively) or TGFβ pro￾duction (Mauri and Blair, 2010). Ashour and Niederkorn have
demonstrated that Breg and Treg collaboration are associated
with the process of immune modulation in anterior chamber
associated immune deviation (ACAID). Their study showed that
following antigen transfer into the anterior chamber of the eye,
the APC function of B cells was essential in generating peripheral
tolerance through the induction of CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory
T cells (Ashour and Niederkorn, 2006). Further evidence is pro￾vided in a model of EAE, where depletion of B cells was related
to a lack of recovery from the disease and delayed emergence of
FoxP3+ cells within the CNS (Ray et al., 2012). Interestingly, in
this model, B cell induction of Treg proliferation was found be

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
dependent on B cell expression of glucocorticoid-induced TNF
ligand (GITRL) rather than IL-10 expression. In fact, B cells are
now becoming well described in their abilities to both positively
and negatively regulate T effector responses, in addition to both
induce and expand Tregs (Lund and Randall, 2010). Thus, an
emerging controversial role of B cells in immunity is apparent,
which is particularly surprising given the established contribu￾tion of allospecific B cells and alloantibody toward organ allograft
rejection.
Currently very few studies have identified a role for Bregs in the
context of transplantation tolerance (Le Texier et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2011). Le Texier et al. have recently revealed that B cells
isolated from tolerant recipients in a rat model of heart transplan￾tation can mediate infectious tolerance on adoptive cell transfer
(Le Texier et al., 2011). In this model, B cells infiltrated and were
localized to the tolerated organ, did not undergo class switch￾ing being maintained as IgM+ cells within the tissue and the
periphery, and were found to express high levels of BANK-1 and
the inhibitory FcgR2b receptor, indicating the generation of an
inhibitory B cell phenotype. In clinical transplantation, the study
by Haynes et al. mentioned earlier has been the first to examine
the functional regulatory contribution of Bregs. In their study,
they observed highest regulation of indirect pathway alloreactiv￾ity in operationally tolerant recipients which was predominantly
TGFβ dependent. One of the methods they used to examine a
Breg effect was by incorporating B cell depletion into their studies
measuring the in vivo DTH response, which showed regulation of
indirect alloreactivity was mediated through a B cell–independent
mechanism. These two studies suggest that maintenance of estab￾lished tolerance may be more dependent on B cells, rather
than tolerance induction. One possibility may be that following
immunosuppression withdrawal, Breg populations may emerge
which are actively involved in mediating tolerance through other
mechanisms such as IL-10 production (Iwata et al., 2011), which
allows speculation that they then have the potential to promote
other immunomodulatory mechanisms such as induction of Tr1
Tregs. These studies correspond with the B cell dominant gene
expression profile and peripheral expansion of B cells detected
within operationally tolerant patient cohorts (Newell et al., 2010;
Pallier et al., 2010; Sagoo et al., 2010), some of which show alter￾ations in specific memory or transitional B cell subsets. One of
the main difficulties in assessing the role of Bregs in clinical trans￾plantation tolerance is the current lack of a definitive Breg marker.
In view of these findings, a resurgent interest in the regulatory
and allopriming role of B cells in transplantation tolerance is
occurring (Adams and Newell, 2012) which may identify a Breg
subset phenotype. More research may also reveal whether Tregs
can influence or alter the generation of a Breg or B cell reper￾toire composed of more tolerogenic anti-inflammatory subtypes
post-transplantation. This and other questions raised throughout
this review may only be answered by the sequential immuno￾logical monitoring of patients pre- and post-transplantation,
operationally tolerant patients or patients undergoing tapered
weaning protocols, as are currently being performed within
the GAMBIT study (Genetic Analysis and Monitoring of
Biomarkers of Immunological Tolerance) at King’s College
London UK.
SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVE
Achieving transplantation tolerance may be viewed as two inter￾linked phases, tolerance induction and maintenance of estab￾lished tolerance. This review finds that while Tregs are associated
with, and in some studies, integral to tolerance induction, Treg￾mediated immune regulation may not be a consistent feature of
long-term tolerance, although this may be an organ-specific phe￾nomenon. To obtain a clearer perspective of the role of Tregs in
the process of establishing tolerance, the evolving alloimmune
response needs to be studied on a longitudinal basis in terms
of several immunomodulatory population phenotypes, e.g., Treg,
Tr1, Th3, Bregs, and functions, using an array of complementary
methods, with parallel monitoring of clinical allograft function.
This sort of comprehensive immune monitoring will require a
solidly collaborative approach, but may reveal the true potential
of Tregs for induction of transplant tolerance.
In developing an optimized Treg therapy for clinical induc￾tion of transplantation tolerance, Tregs with indirect donor￾alloantigen specificity are likely to be most effective at delivering
long-term stable graft survival, which is attributed to their abil￾ity to suppress multiple immune cell types, and their potential
to interact with and promote other immunoregulatory processes,
through linked suppression and infectious tolerance. New find￾ings highlight an emerging role of the semi-direct pathway in
alloantigen presentation, which combined with the prominent
role of the indirect pathway in driving rejection and tolerance,
makes a stronger case for the use of indirect allospecific Treg
therapy. Indeed, although Tregs with direct allospecificity may
be able to deliver localized immune regulation to the allograft,
they would be limited in their ability to control the effector and
allopriming arms of the indirect alloresponse, which occur at dif￾ferent anatomical sites, however this would again be dependent
upon the degree of HLA matching between the donor and recip￾ient. Furthermore, although direct allorecognition can lead to
a vigorous inflammatory response resulting in direct cell medi￾ated damage and hyperacute rejection of allografted tissues, it
can be effectively controlled with immunosuppressive drugs to
avoid acute rejection, as evidenced by the high success rate of graft
acceptance early post-transplantation.
Clinical translation of Treg cell therapy faces several major
challenges. First and foremost is the challenge of developing clin￾ically transferrable protocols for the selection and expansion of
human donor alloantigen-specific Tregs, particularly Tregs with
indirect allospecificity (Jiang et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2008). Very
little progress has been made in this respect, which is primarily
due to the complexity of studying indirect allorecognition with
the tools and methods currently available, which is further com￾plicated by the breadth of mismatched allogeneic HLA peptides
that alloreactive T cells may respond to (Waanders et al., 2008).
The advantage is that by generating Tregs with specificity for a
single immunodominant allopeptide, the Tregs will be able to
mediate regulation against all allogeneic peptides through linked
suppression as evidenced by the work described above (LeGuern
et al., 2010). Indeed, work is currently underway in our laboratory
to generate human Tregs with indirect allospecificity, to demon￾strate this potential in an in vivo humanized mouse xenograft
model.

Sagoo et al. Donor-specific Treg induction of tolerance
A potentially serious caveat to using donor alloantigen-specific
Tregs in vivo is the potential of transferring contaminating allore￾active T effectors, or indeed alloantigen-specific Tregs with the
capacity to convert to proinflammatory Th17 effector cells, par￾ticularly in light of their emerging role in contributing toward
graft rejection (Burlingham et al., 2007; Chadha et al., 2011).
Efforts to limit this possibility are focusing on identifying key
triggers and Treg subset markers which describe Tregs with Th17-
conversion potential. However, do we really need to limit transfer
of effector populations of Th17 differentiating cells or will the
transfusion of Tregs into a regulatory or suppressive environment
induced by immunosuppression for example, result in immun￾odominance by Tregs? Treg cell products currently being used in
clinical HSCT can often be composed of only 50% FoxP3+CD4+
T cells, to deliver a Treg and graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect
in vivo, with no adverse or aggressive GvHD effects reported as
a direct consequence (Edinger and Hoffmann, 2011). Further
in vivo studies are required to understand the real risk of donor￾specific Treg infusion in cell therapy.
Another potential limitation of Treg therapy is assessing its
capacity to control alloreactive memory. Memory T cell responses
naturally provide rapid and potent T cell immunity and are
a barrier to most transplantation tolerance induction strategies
(Lakkis and Sayegh, 2003). Although Tregs have been demon￾strated to work extremely effectively at inducing transplantation
tolerance in murine models, very few have examined the capac￾ity of Tregs to primed T cell responses (Marshall et al., 1996), to
inhibit allograft rejection. Studying the efficacy of Tregs in exper￾imental rodent systems and models cannot be accurately assessed
due to the absence of a memory T cell pool, the importance
of which has recently been demonstrated in a study correlating
the presence or frequency of pre-existing T cell memory cells
in non-human primates, with graft rejection (Nadazdin et al.,
2011). The ability of Tregs to regulate memory T cell responses
has been shown to be limited compared to naïve T cells when
applied at the same ratio of Tregs to effectors cells (Yang et al.,
2007; Afzali et al., 2011), which has important implications for
the timing at which Treg therapy may need to be applied as pre￾existing alloreactive memory T cells may otherwise be stimulated
by the transplanted organ to provoke an aggressive alloimmune
response (Brook et al., 2006). Treg therapy may need to be applied
in concert or in succession to immunosuppression to efficiently
overcome donor-specific memory T-cell responses, as recently
demonstrated by Yamada et al. using a presensitised non-human
primate model of combined renal allograft and mixed chimerism,
to induce transplantation tolerance (Yamada et al., 2012). The
humanized mouse also represents a useful tool which can be engi￾neered as a clinically relevant model of human graft rejection to
study human Treg function (Shultz et al., 2007; Nadig et al., 2010;
Sagoo et al., 2011). By reconstituting mice with human PBMCs,
human immune subsets, replete with memory compartments can
be established to permit an assessment of the capacity of human
Tregs to regulate memory immune subsets or processes in order to
achieve transplantation tolerance. It may also allow a more com￾prehensive evaluation of the immunoregulatory effects of Tregs
on a more complete spectrum of functional human immunity,
such as priming of indirect alloresponses and B cell mediated
alloimmunity.
In summary, review of experimental and clinical data on
transplantation tolerance support the use of donor-specific Treg
therapy for establishing immunological tolerance in the clinc,
in particular, Tregs with indirect allospecificity. Although cur￾rent studies lack a clear demonstration of the comparative effi￾cacy of Tregs with either direct or indirect allospecificity, there
is strong evidence for an integral role of Tregs in establish￾ing tolerance, although their contribution toward maintaining
the stable tolerant state is unclear, and requires further investi￾gation. Treg cell therapy may, therefore, be envisaged as being
administered early during the post-transplantation period to
accelerate the generation of other associated immunoregulatory
processes that act toward maintaining stable immunological graft
acceptance.
