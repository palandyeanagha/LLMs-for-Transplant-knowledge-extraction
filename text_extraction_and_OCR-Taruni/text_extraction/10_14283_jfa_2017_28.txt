Abstract
Background: Frailty is prevalent in the older adult population (≥65 years of age) and results in 
adverse outcomes in the emergency general surgical population. 
Objective: To determine whether frailty exists in the younger adult emergency surgical 
population (<65 years) and what influence frailty may have on patient related outcomes.
Design: prospective observational cohort study.
Setting: emergency general surgical admissions.
Participants: all patients ≥40 years divided into 2 groups: younger adults (40-64.9 years) and 
older adult comparative group (≥65).
Measurements: over a 6-month time frame the following data was collected: demographics; 
Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD); blood markers; multi-morbidities,poly-pharmacy
and cognition. Frailty was assessed by completion of the Canadian Study of Health and Ageing 
(CSHA). Each patient was followed up for 90 days to allow determination of length of stay, re￾admission and mortality.
Results: 82 young adults were included and the prevalence of frailty was 16% (versus older adults 
38%; p=0.001) and associated with: multi-morbidity; poly-pharmacy; cognitive impairment; and 
deprivation. Frailty in younger adults resulted in longer hospital stay and had 5times greater risk 
of mortality at 30 and 90 days [OR 5.67, 95% CI (0.33-96.89)]. 
Conclusions: This novel study has found that frailty exists in 16% of younger adults admitted to 
emergency general surgical units, leading to adverse short and long-term outcomes. Strategies 
need to be developed that identify and treat frailty in this vulnerable younger adult population. 
Keywords: frailty; young adults, emergency surgery.
Introduction

3
Frailty is a complex concept which has been defined as “a medical syndrome with multiple causes 
and contributors that is characterised by diminished strength, endurance and reduced 
physiologic function that increases an individual’s vulnerability for developing increased 
dependency and/or death”[1,2]. It has almost exclusively been studied in the older adult 
populations (aged 65 years or above), particularly in the medical and community settings, where 
it has been shown to be associated with impaired cognition, delirium, multi-morbidity and poly￾pharmacy resulting in increased morbidity, mortality and hospital re-admission [3]. 
In older adult surgical populations, the presence of frailty has been associated with adverse 
elective and emergency postoperative outcomes, including increased length of hospital stay and 
three-to-four fold increases in death [4][5][6]. These findings have led to interventions, including 
the multi-disciplinary approach of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) that identify 
and address specific geriatric issues pre-operatively to potentially improve patient outcomes [7].
Despite research that has suggested chronological age does not always reflect biological age, 
there has been little work assessing the incidence of frailty in younger adults (<65 years of age) 
in either surgical or non-surgical populations [8]. One group assessed outcomes in cardiac 
surgical patients finding that the presence of frailty increased the risk of adverse outcomes, an 
effect that was independent of age suggesting that frailty is not unique to the older population 
[9].
This study aimed to determine the prevalence of frailty in a younger adult population admitted 
with emergency general surgical conditions using an older adult cohort as a comparative 

4
reference group. The secondary aim was to look at the association between frailty and patient 
related outcomes.

Methods
Patients.
Consecutive patients aged 40 years and upwards were included into this prospective cohort 
study which was performed in accordance with the STROBE Statement [10]. Each patient had 
been admitted to the acute general surgical unit of one hospital in the West of Scotland and was 
identified and data collected during 2 ten-week time frames between October 2014 and March 
2015. This study was deemed a service evaluation and was registered with The Clinical 
Effectiveness Department, Greater Glasgow and Clyde on 24/10/2014. Patients were excluded if 
they lacked capacity to give verbal consent to completing the questionnaires. 
Data Collection.
The following data were collected on admission using the hospital’s electronic records system, 
patient case notes and prescribing charts: age; sex; Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(SIMD) quintile (SIMD is an established tool for identifying areas of poverty and inequality across 
Scotland where 1 -2 indicates the most deprived groups and 3-5 the least deprived) [11], 
haemoglobin (≤129g/L defined as anaemia), albumin (≤35g/L defined as hypoalbuminaemia), 
number of current medications (≥5 considered poly-pharmacy).multi-morbidity (defined as ≥2 
co-morbidities) and cognition using the MoCA. The Montreal Cognition Assessment Test or 
MoCA, is is a 30-point questionnaire that assesses 7 areas of cognitive function where a score of 
26 or greater is considered normal. It has been validated in elderly populations, including 
Alzheimer’s disease [13,14] and in older emergency general surgical patients [15]. It was assessed 
within 24 hours of hospital admission.

6
It was recorded whether each patient underwent surgery and the maximum level of care each 
patient received during their admission (ward, High Dependency/ Intensive Care Unit). Length of 
hospital stay, readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge, and death within 30 or 90 days 
of the original acute admission were recorded.
Assessment of Frailty
Within 24 hours of admission and prior to any surgery, patients were assessed for the presence 
of frailty. To minimise observer bias, four researchers were responsible for identifying patients 
for the study, including and led by the main author with all receiving formal training in the tools 
for measuring frailty. 
To assess frailty, we used a 7-point clinical frailty scale derived from the Canadian Study of Health 
and Ageing (CSHA) [15]. The scale is derived from a deficit-based Frailty Index and has been 
widely validated across a range of populations [16]. Participants were classified as frail if they 
scored 5 or greater [15]. Statistical Analysis.
Descriptive statistics were generated to compare demographic and clinical case-mix of the
patients, by age group (younger adults: 40-64.9 versus older adult reference group 65 and 
older). Unless otherwise stated, for continuous data two sample Student t-tests were used
unless the residuals breached the assumptions of normality and then a Mann Whitney-U test was 
used, and for categorical data Chi-squared test were used. In cases where the assumptions of 
the Chi-squared were violated, the Fisher’s exact test was used. In the younger age group a crude 
logistic regression was used to test for associations between clinical outcome (mortality at 30 
days, and length of hospital stay) and frailty. All statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 
version 22[17].

Results
Patient Demographics.
A total of 169 patients were admitted to the emergency surgical unit during the study time frame 
with 82 younger adults and 87 in the older adult reference group. All questionnaires and 
assessments were completed except for 9 patients who were unable to complete the MoCA.
Comparison of the two groups found the younger adults had: lower multi-morbidity (41% vs 74%, 
P<0.001), lower poly-pharmacy (38% vs 82%, P<0.001), and fewer patients with anaemia (30% vs 
51%, P=0.003) and hypoalbuminaemia (33% vs 59%, P<0.001). There were no differences between 
groups in the number of patients that underwent surgery, however younger adults had a 
significantly shorter length of hospital stay (median 3 days vs 4, p=0.046) and were more likely 
to be clinically managed on the general surgical ward (95% vs 78%, p=0.001). Re-admission rates 
and 30 and 90-day mortality did not differ between the younger and older adult groups [Table 
1], but caution is needed when interpreting these findings as they were under powered.
Frailty in younger adults.
Frailty was recorded in 16% of the younger adults (versus 38% of older adults; p=0.001). Table 2 
displays the comparison of frail versus non-frail younger adults finding the presence of frailty to 
be associated with: cognitive impairment [OR 12.31 (2.51-60.49); P=0.002]; multi-morbidity [OR 
25.64 (3.13 -209.75); P=0.002]; poly-pharmacy [OR 7.62 (1.90-30.54); P=0.004] and higher levels 
of deprivation [OR 4.60 (1.16-18.20); P=0.030]. In addition, there was evidence of a prolonged 
hospital stay in frail younger patients [less than 3 days versus 1 week stay; OR 3.31 (0.93-44.9); 
P=0.06]. 

9
At 90-days, only one patient had died in frail and non-frail groups. Frailty resulted in 5times 
greater risk of mortality at 30 and 90 days [OR 5.67, 95% CI (0.33-96.89)].

Discussion
This study is the first to document that frailty exists in 1a significant proportion (16% in this 
cohort) of younger adults admitted as a surgical emergency and is associated with longer 
hospital stays and carries a higher risk of mortality. This study supports the concept that frailty 
is not unique to the older adult population and that early identification and management 
strategies need to be developed that improve outcomes for these vulnerable young adults. 
Indeed, it may be that the strategies being developed for older adults, including Cognitive 
Geriatric Assessment should be transferred to the frail younger adults [7].
Why frailty exists in younger adults appears to be associated with similar factors that influence 
frailty in the older adult population: multi-morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment. 
If frailty is a clinical expression about a patient’s vulnerability, both physiologically and 
psychologically, to recover from an acute illness, then it is not unexpected that these 3 factors 
also influence frailty in younger adults [2,5,6,9]. This could be reflecting a disconnection between 
chronological and biological ageing, leading to the idea thatfrailty in younger adults could reflect 
‘accelerated ageing’. Mitnitski et al (2013) stated that ageing develops gradually and starts from 
small changes in health, which accumulate across adult life [18]. Theses changes result in deficits 
in health and an increase in recovery time with each new health issue, which in the older adult 
population leads to an increased level of care on hospital discharge. These findings were 
consistent in this population of frail younger adults where evidence of health deficits (multi￾morbidity, poly-pharmacy and cognitive impairment) led to a significantly longer time to in￾hospital recovery.

11
Deprivation was also associated with frailty in the younger adults and this is of particular interest 
in Greater Glasgow, where premature mortality rates consistently exceed the UK average across 
all categories of deprivation [19]. There is currently no explanation for this phenomenon, which 
is often referred to as the “Glasgow Effect” as other post-industrial cities in the UK with similar 
profiles of deprivation do not have similarly high mortality rates [19,20,21]. If deprivation is linked 
to frailty then comparison of this cohort to another in the U.K. could provide more insight.
Although the presence of frailty in younger adults did not significantly influence re-admission 
and mortality rates, it is worth highlighting that those frail, younger patients were 5 times more 
likely to die at 30 and 90 days post-admission. However it is a limitation of this study that there 
are small numbers in each group and that it was not powered. Future multi-centred work, 
including a focus on frail patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, is planned to increase 
patient numbers, allowing improved analysis of these patient outcomes.
Conclusions
Frailty is not unique to the older adult population, existing in 16% of the younger adult emergency 
surgical population. Frail young adult patients have a significantly prolonged hospital stay and 
have a higher risk of mortality at 30 and 90 days. Frailty is influenced by multi-morbidity, poly￾pharmacy, cognitive impairment and deprivation and early recognition and management of this 
condition could lead to improved patient outcomes.
