Clinical interest in de novo lipogenesis has been sparked by recent studies in rodents
demonstrating that de novo lipogenesis specifically in white adipose tissue produces the
insulin-sensitizing fatty acid palmitoleate. By contrast, hepatic lipogenesis is thought to
contribute to metabolic disease. How de novo lipogenesis in white adipose tissue versus liver
is altered in human obesity and insulin resistance is poorly understood. Here we show that
lipogenic enzymes and the glucose transporter-4 are markedly decreased in white adipose
tissue of insulin-resistant obese individuals compared with non-obese controls. By contrast,
lipogenic enzymes are substantially upregulated in the liver of obese subjects. Bariatric weight
loss restored de novo lipogenesis and glucose transporter-4 gene expression in white adipose
tissue. Notably, lipogenic gene expression in both white adipose tissue and liver was strongly
linked to the expression of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-b and to
metabolic risk markers. Thus, de novo lipogenesis predicts metabolic health in humans in a
tissue-specific manner and is likely regulated by glucose-dependent carbohydrate-responsive
element-binding protein activation.

L
ipid metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver
contribute to whole-body metabolic homoeostasis1–3. Recent
rodent studies demonstrated that de novo lipogenesis (DNL),
the synthesis of fatty acids from non-lipid precursors, in WAT is
downregulated in obesity and that restoring DNL selectively in
WAT reverts obesity-dependent insulin resistance4,5, suggesting
that reduction in DNL or alterations in the relevant products such
as monounsaturated fatty acids is an important contributor to
systemic insulin resistance and metabolic disease. Palmitoleate
(C16:1n7), a DNL-derived fatty acid, appears to mediate the
insulin-sensitizing effects of DNL in murine WAT4,6,7. In
contrast to WAT, DNL in the liver has been found to be
upregulated in rodent and human obesity, where it is believed to
promote lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) and atherogenic dyslipidemia8. Proposed
molecular mechanisms of DNL-induced lipotoxicity are, for
example, exaggerated synthesis of insulin resistance-inducing
ceramides from palmitate (C16:0) (ref. 9) and activation of the
innate immune system by saturated fatty acids10. Based on this
association between hepatic DNL and the metabolic syndrome, it
is believed that inhibition of DNL may be a viable approach to
treating obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D)
(ref. 11). However, assuming that DNL in human WAT is
associated with metabolic health, this may not be a promising
approach when used systemically.
Bariatric surgery has become an important therapeutic option
for the treatment of severe obesity-associated insulin resistance
and T2D. Weight loss after bariatric surgery increases insulin
sensitivity in liver, muscle and fat12. Furthermore, it improves
metabolic inflammation13, atherogenic dyslipidemia14 as well as
NAFLD (ref. 15). With regard to WAT function, bariatric surgery
was reported to normalize lipolysis12 and plasma levels of
adipokines16. Thus, it is well recognized that bariatric surgery can
improve overall metabolic health, but it remains unclear how
it improves insulin sensitivity17, and whether DNL in WAT
changes after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss.
To explore the effect of obesity on WAT and liver DNL and the
potential reversibility of obesity-induced DNL changes after
bariatric weight loss, we analysed the expression of key DNL
enzymes and regulators in visceral and subcutaneous WAT (SAT)
as well as liver samples collected in two cohorts of metabolically
well-characterized human subjects. Furthermore, we determined
the fatty acid composition of WAT to study the potential impact
of DNL-derived fatty acids on metabolic health. Finally, the
relation of altered DNL in WAT and liver, respectively, to
metabolic risk was investigated by determining the correlations of
DNL proteins and fatty acids with measures of insulin resistance
and NAFLD.
Results
Obesity is associated with reduced DNL in visceral WAT. We
assessed the effects of obesity on WAT DNL by mRNA expres￾sion analyses in visceral WAT (VAT) specimens of all 165 study
subjects, focusing on four key enzymes: acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzymes converting
acetyl-CoA to palmitate (C16:0) (ref. 18), stearoyl-CoA
desaturase (SCD) that carries out D9-desaturation of saturated
fatty acids such as the C16:0 conversion to C16:1n7 (ref. 19) and
fatty acid elongase 6 (ELOVL6), which elongates C16 to C18 fatty
acids20. FASN and ELOVL6 mRNA were downregulated in VAT
of obese subjects, whereas SCD was increased, as demonstrated by
a statistical model (analysis of covariance, ANCOVA) addressing
the association of body mass index (BMI) with DNL gene
expression and its relationship with age and gender (Fig. 1a–c).
Within the model, the expression of FASN and SCD was
independent of gender, whereas ELOVL6 expression was
somewhat lower, and less dependent on BMI, in females (Supple￾mentary Table S1). Furthermore, the negative associations of BMI
with FASN and ELOVL6 mRNA were exaggerated with higher
age, as revealed by significant interaction terms: BMI  age in the
ANCOVA model (Supplementary Table S1). To account for the
possibility that these apparent age effects were caused by an age
bias inherent to the cohort, with obese subjects being on average
much younger than non-obese, further detailed analyses were
performed with three partially age-matched and fully gender￾matched subgroups of the study population (n ¼ 20; see Table 1
for anthropometric and clinical parameters). The control group
consists of non-obese patients undergoing lower intestine surgery.
The obese groups include obese bariatric surgery patients
either without or with T2D, hereafter referred to as obese and
obese-diabetic.
In keeping with our findings in the total cohort, VAT mRNA
expression levels of FASN and ELOVL6 (Fig. 1d,e) were lower in
both obese and obese-diabetic individuals compared to non-obese
controls, whereas SCD mRNA showed a trend for higher expres￾sion in obese subjects (Fig. 1f). No significant associations with
gender or age were observed. The insulin-sensitive glucose
transporter GLUT4 is a protein of particular interest for DNL,
because it is rate-limiting for shuttling the DNL substrate glucose
into adipocytes. Previously, GLUT4 was shown to be downregu￾lated in SAT of obese or diabetic subjects21. Consistent with these
results, we observed that VAT GLUT4 mRNA was markedly
downregulated in both obese groups (Fig. 1g). Importantly, these
findings were confirmed at the protein level. The expression of
GLUT4, FASN and ACC was substantially decreased in obese and
obese-diabetic individuals, as assessed by western blot analysis in
the exact same cohort (Fig. 1h–k).
VAT DNL is linked to ChREBP-b and metabolic risk factors.
The observed strong regulation of VAT DNL proteins prompted
us to study known transcriptional regulators of DNL and to check
whether they were downregulated themselves. Gene expression of
the lipogenic transcription factor sterol response element-binding
protein-1 (SREBP1) was unaltered in VAT of obese compared
with non-obese subjects (Fig. 2a). Another important lipogenic
transcription factor is carbohydrate-responsive element-binding
protein (ChREBP), which is activated by increased glucose flux22
and, therefore, is intimately linked to GLUT4 function in adipo￾cytes. Interestingly, the expression of ChREBP-b, a recently
discovered short isoform correlating strongly with ChREBP
activity23, but not that of the conventional full length isoform,
now termed ChREBP-a, was markedly reduced in obese and
obese-diabetic compared to non-obese controls (Fig. 2b,c).
Overall, ChREBP-b expression levels were, however, much
lower than those of ChREBP-a.
It was previously demonstrated that a reduced capacity for
DNL in WAT is linked to insulin resistance in mice4,23. Further￾more, there is evidence that WAT DNL suppresses liver DNL
and, consequently, reduces liver steatosis4. Therefore, we next
asked whether the DNL-related molecules showing the strongest
obesity-dependent regulation in VAT, namely ChREBP-b,
FASN and GLUT4, were associated with insulin resistance and
liver steatosis. Indeed, VAT GLUT4 protein, FASN protein and
ChREBP-b mRNA correlated inversely with homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Fig. 2d–f) and the
degree of liver steatosis (Fig. 2g–i). HOMA-IR and liver steatosis
were, however, not independently associated with the DNL
parameters, probably because they strongly correlate with each
other (R ¼ 0.67, P ¼ 1.4  10  7, Pearson correlation, two-tailed
t-test). When both parameters were combined in an ANCOVA,

only one of them showed a significant association, respectively,
namely VAT ChREBP-b mRNA with liver steatosis, and VAT
FASN and GLUT4 protein expression with HOMA-IR
(Supplementary Table S2).
Regulation of DNL may differ between WAT depots and,
although excessive SAT is believed to be less harmful than
excessive VAT24, it is more abundant and this may have
physiological implications. Therefore, we determined SAT DNL
gene expression in all three experimental groups. Similar to VAT,
we found a profound downregulation of FASN and GLUT4, but
no significant regulation of ELOVL6 or SCD mRNA in SAT
samples of obese and obese-diabetic subjects, whereas TNFa
mRNA was upregulated in obese-diabetic subjects (Fig. 3a–e).
ChREBP-a expression was decreased in SAT of obese-diabetic
individuals (Fig. 3f), whereas ChREBP-b mRNA was detectable
by PCR but expression was too low for quantification by real-time
PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Obesity is associated with less C18:0 but not C16:1n7 in VAT.
DNL in mice is tightly linked to the synthesis and abundance of
C16:1n7 (ref. 4). In humans, C16:1n7 is believed to reflect

only a moderate trend for a decrease was observed in obese￾diabetic compared with obese (Fig. 4a–d). C16:1n7 concentration
correlated positively with expression of both FASN and SCD in
VAT (Fig. 4e,f). The fact that FASN and SCD are inversely altered
in the obese state (Fig. 1a,c) may explain why C16:1n7 is not
lower in human obesity.
In contrast to C16:1n7, we detected a strong decrease in obese
and obese-diabetic subjects for stearate (C18:0) (Fig. 4a–c) and
very long chain-fatty acids derived from C18:0 (C20:0, C22:0,
C24:0, C24:1, Supplementary Fig. S2). C16:0 was unchanged bet￾ween groups (Fig. 4a–c). C18:0 trended to correlate positively
with FASN (R ¼ 0.21, P ¼ 0.13) and ELOVL6 expression
(R ¼ 0.27, P ¼ 0.04), but negatively with SCD (R ¼  0.38,
P ¼ 0.004) in VAT (Pearson correlations, two-tailed t-test).
Thus, the decrease of FASN and ELOVL6 combined with
the increase of SCD in VAT of obese patients might explain
the reduction of VAT C18:0 in obesity.
Next, we asked whether DNL-derived fatty acid species in VAT
are linked to insulin resistance. C16:1n7 did not significantly
correlate with HOMA-IR (R ¼  0.14, P ¼ 0.33). By contrast,
C18:0 demonstrated a strong, negative correlation comparable
to those of the DNL proteins with HOMA-IR (R ¼  0.50,
P ¼ 0.00016), while oleate (C18:1n9) exhibited a positive but
weaker correlation (R ¼ 0.28, P ¼ 0.046; Pearson correlations,
two-tailed t-test).
SAT DNL gene expression is restored after bariatric surgery.
Bariatric surgery is a clinical intervention that often leads to
marked weight loss and an improvement of metabolic health
with the potential to cure T2D. The mechanisms mediating
the salutary effects of bariatric surgery are not fully understood.
To address the question whether increased WAT DNL may be
one of them, we determined the expression of DNL genes in SAT
obtained from obese patients before and after bariatric weight
loss. As expected, bariatric surgery resulted in significantly
reduced body weight and overall improvement of their metabolic
state (Table 2). Expression of FASN, ELOVL6 and GLUT4, but
not SCD, in SAT increased after weight loss (Fig. 5a–d).
Expression of ChREBP-a was moderately increased after weight
loss (Fig. 5e), whereas ChREBP-b expression was below the level
of detection. In contrast to upregulation of DNL, expression of
TNFa was reduced after weight loss (Fig. 5f), which is consistent
with a recent report26.
Obesity is associated with increased liver ChREBP-b and DNL.
Elevated liver DNL in obesity can contribute to the development
of insulin resistance8. The role of liver DNL in metabolic disease
in humans and especially its relationship to WAT DNL is,
however, not well understood. Therefore we analysed DNL
expression in liver biopsies of the exact same individuals
having been used for analyses of VAT DNL. In contrast to
VAT (Fig. 1a–f), we found that the mRNAs of FASN and
ELOVL6 were significantly upregulated in livers of obese subjects
(Fig. 6a,b; Supplementary Fig. S3a,b). Liver SCD mRNA exhibited
higher variability and a less pronounced increase in obese subjects
(Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. S3c). Liver FASN mRNA correlated
inversely with VAT FASN protein (Fig. 6g), indicating a potential
mechanistic link between VAT and liver FASN regulation in
obesity. Regulation of DNL in liver was further studied by western
blot analysis. Owing to sample limitations we were only able to
analyse a small set of liver tissue specimens, different from the
subgroups described in Table 1 (see Supplementary Table S3).
FASN protein expression in obese subjects tended to be increased,
although this analysis was underpowered, and we therefore failed
to reach statistical significance in the ANCOVA (Supplementary
Fig. S3d). FASN protein levels were, however, higher when both

obese groups were combined and compared with the non-obese
subjects (Fig. 6h) and they correlated with FASN mRNA
quantified in the same liver specimens (Supplementary Fig.
S3f), indicating that FASN mRNA levels reflect FASN protein
levels in human livers.
Next, we asked whether the expression of lipogenic
transcription factors was altered in livers of obese subjects in a
fashion similar to their putative target genes. Liver mRNA levels
of SREBP1 (Fig. 6d) were not increased in obesity. However, the
expression of ChREBP-b was substantially elevated, whereas
ChREBP-a was slightly decreased in livers of obese individuals
(Fig. 6e,f), suggesting an important role for ChREBP-b in
regulating liver DNL. In line with liver ChREBP-b and
its target genes having a role in steatosis and potentially
also with insulin resistance8, we observed a positive correlation
of ChREBP-b and FASN mRNA with HOMA-IR and the degree
of liver steatosis (Fig. 6i–l). The association with liver steatosis
was, however, weaker and not independent of that with HOMA￾IR (Supplementary Table S2).
Discussion
In the present study we demonstrate that WAT DNL is
suppressed in human obesity and T2D by showing that the
expression of the key DNL enzymes ACC and FASN is markedly
decreased in VAT of obese subjects. These findings are in line
with previous publications reporting downregulation of lipogenic
mRNAs in WAT of obese humans27–29 and rodents30,31. In
addition to the suppression of DNL enzymes, we observed a
profound downregulation of GLUT4 in VAT of obese subjects
(Fig. 1), complementing previous studies that were limited to
human SAT21,32. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate a
coordinated upregulation of WAT DNL genes and GLUT4 after
bariatric weight loss (Fig. 5). In light of transgenic mouse studies
demonstrating that adipose tissue GLUT4 is an important
regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity33, the obesity￾dependent GLUT4 decrease and the marked inverse correlation
of GLUT4 protein with HOMA-IR observed in this study (Fig. 2)
strongly support the notion that GLUT4 promotes insulin
sensitivity also in humans, possibly as a pacemaker of adipocyte
DNL. GLUT4 does not only provide substrate for DNL, it is also

critical for the lipogenic transcription factor ChREBP, which is
activated on increased glucose flux22. Diminished ChREBP
activation due to defective GLUT4 expression, and presumably
GLUT4 translocation, may thus be responsible for the reduced
DNL gene expression in obesity. While this manuscript
was under preparation, a novel ChREBP isoform (ChREBP-b),
derived from an alternative promoter, was described23. ChREBP￾b is shorter than the conventional isoform (ChREBP-a) and has
higher activity due to constitutive nuclear localization. We found
a clear coregulation of ChREBP-b but not ChREBP-a with
DNL genes in VAT (Fig. 2). Our data, thus, complement the
finding by Herman et al.23, which demonstrated a link of human
SAT ChREBP-b to insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 expression.
We did not observe a downregulation of the quantitatively
dominant isoform ChREBP-a in VAT of obese subjects, as
reported recently34, and only a moderate one in SAT (Fig. 3). The
discrepancy may be due to the younger age and the leaner
phenotype of the non-obese controls in that study compared with
ours.
In addition to WAT, we show here for the first time that
ChREBP-b is coregulated with DNL enzymes in liver (Fig. 6).
Given that the well-studied isoform ChREBP-a is regulated
mostly at the posttranslational level, previous studies using
gene expression readout could not reliably assess ChREBP
activity. ChREBP-b mRNA levels better reflect activity because
the ChREBP-b promoter is autoactivated by ChREBP23. Taken
together, our data indicate that ChREBP regulates DNL in
human liver, supporting the view that ChREBP, activated through
elevated hepatic hexose flux, for example, by fructose-rich
nutrition35 or SREBP1-dependent induction of glucokinase36, is
a major mechanism by which DNL is induced in livers of obese
and insulin-resistant humans.
Activity of DNL enzymes influences tissue fatty acid
profiles4,37. We found that, in contrast to FASN, SCD was
moderately upregulated in VAT of obese individuals (Fig. 1).
This suggests increased SCD activity in adipose tissue of
obese individuals and can explain the most prominent fatty
acid changes we observed in obese subjects, namely a decrease
in C18:0 and an increase in C18:1n9 (Fig. 4). Similarly, it may
explain another important observation in our study, the lack of
substantial obesity-dependent changes in VAT C16:1n7
concentration (Fig. 4), which is consistent with a recent human
study reporting a positive correlation of WAT C16:1n7 with
BMI38. In obese mice, the murine SCD homologue SCD1 was
found to be downregulated in WAT4, explaining the decrease of
C16:1n7, but not C18:0 in all major lipid classes of WAT in these
mice4. Thus, regulation of adipose tissue SCD seems to differ
between humans and mice. Our data indicate a higher capacity of
obese humans versus mice to adapt to an unhealthy excess of
C18:0 and other saturated fatty acids through D9-desaturation.
Although not studied in detail so far, there is some experimental
evidence indicating that C18:0 in diet or as free fatty acid (FFA)
induces insulin resistance39–41. Accordingly, the negative
correlation of C18:0 with BMI and HOMA-IR that we and
others37 observed may rather reflect protective conversion of the
unhealthy fatty acid C18:0 than a (hypothetical) insulin￾sensitizing effect of C18:0. On the other hand, SCD1 and
C18:1n9 were recently demonstrated to mediate obesity-induced
inflammation and insulin resistance in WAT42. Thus, the
observed induction of SCD in VAT of obese subjects can also
be interpreted as a maladaptive state and it remains difficult to
estimate the net effect on metabolic health.
To what extent C16:1n7 is an insulin-sensitizing factor in
humans, as it is in mice4,6,7, is a matter of ongoing debate43–45
and cannot be directly inferred from our data. The current model
assigns the insulin-sensitizing role to C16:1n7 within FFA, the
major lipid class released from WAT4. For technical reasons, we
did not measure fatty acids in the FFA fraction of VAT but
determined total VAT fatty acid profiles. The latter closely
correspond to serum FFA profiles in humans, at least with regard
to C16:1n7 and other DNL-derived fatty acids44,46. In any event,
the preserved concentration of C16:1n7 in VAT of obese subjects
(Fig. 4) may explain why C16:1n7 does not significantly correlate
with HOMA-IR, in stark contrast to FASN and GLUT4 protein
levels (Fig. 2). It is conceivable that DNL-linked molecules other
than FFA, which we may have missed in the total tissue fatty acid
analysis, are released from adipose tissue and counteract insulin
resistance. Clearly, more work is needed to unravel potential
mechanisms connecting adipose DNL to systemic insulin
sensitivity in humans, which may lead to the identification of

alternative lipid species or non-lipid molecules with similar
biological functions as C16:1n7 in rodents.
In contrast to the downregulation of DNL in WAT we
observed a profound induction of FASN, ELOVL6 and SCD in
livers of obese subjects (Fig. 6). This observation is very important
as (i) it complements previous human studies that could assess
hepatic DNL only indirectly through tracer incorporation into
VLDL fatty acids47,48 and (ii) it shows for the first time that there
is an inverse correlation between liver and WAT FASN expres￾sion (Fig. 6). The correlation of liver FASN expression with
HOMA-IR and the degree of liver steatosis (Fig. 6) supports
the concept that hepatic lipogenic induction can promote the
development of NAFLD and insulin resistance8. However,
elevated liver DNL does not lead to insulin resistance in every
case, as elegantly demonstrated in a recent study using adenoviral
hepatic overexpression of ChREBP-a in mice. Despite massive
liver triglyceride accumulation, these mice were not insulin
resistant, and on high-fat diet even more insulin sensitive than
controls49. Contrasting with these results, adenoviral ChREBP-a
knockdown improved insulin resistance in leptin-deficient obese
mice50. Furthermore, inducing DNL in liver through transgenic
overexpression of SREBP1 induced insulin resistance in mice on
normal diet51. Thus, excessive hepatic DNL does not invariably
cause insulin resistance. Clearly, more research is needed to
understand how disturbed liver lipid metabolism and patterns are
linked to liver metabolic dysfunction3 and whether DNL-linked
steatosis in obese humans is cause or consequence of metabolic
disease. At least, several rodent studies demonstrate that reducing

the activity of DNL enzymes can be used to treat metabolic
disorders. For example, it was reported that inhibiting liver
FASN11 or ELOVL6 (ref. 52) improved insulin resistance and
atherosclerosis in mice. In light of these therapeutic proof-of￾concept studies indicating beneficial effects on insulin resistance
and atherosclerosis, our liver data provide important target
validation for pharmacological DNL inhibitors. However, one
needs to take into account that inhibition of these enzymes in
WAT may promote systemic insulin resistance, as discussed
above, and DNL inhibition with concomitantly reduced
monounsaturated fatty acids may also have adverse effects in
other cell types, especially in macrophages53 and pancreatic
b-cells54–56. Selective inhibition using molecules preferentially
taken up by liver such as the FASN inhibitor platensimycin11
could be a way to prevent unwanted consequences of DNL
suppression in extra-hepatic tissues. As an additional measure,
nutritional C16:1n7 supplementation could be used to mitigate
negative effects of DNL inhibition. Given the strong effects of
C16:1n7 on cultured macrophages and b-cells53–55, and positive
results in mouse studies6,7, this is a promising approach that does,
however, require in vivo validation studies in humans.
In summary, our study demonstrates that DNL enzymes
are markedly suppressed in WAT of obese subjects, as is GLUT4.
This suppression is closely linked to impaired metabolic
control and can be reversed by weight loss through bariatric
intervention. Furthermore, we show that in obesity, liver DNL is
profoundly upregulated, and is closely linked to insulin resistance
as well as liver steatosis. Thus, DNL inversely correlates between
WAT and liver and is closely linked with markers of metabolic
health. The novel ChREBP isoform ChREBP-b is tightly
associated with DNL gene expression in both VAT and liver,
indicating a key role of glucose metabolism in the regulation of
lipogenesis.
Methods
Study subjects. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery (n ¼ 61), abdominal surgery
for early colorectal cancer (n ¼ 48), pancreatic cancer (n ¼ 22), other cancers of the
gastrointestinal tract or benign diseases such as sigma-diverticulosis at the
Department of General and Visceral Surgery, University of Ulm, Germany, from
2002–2010 were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were type 1 diabetes and
acute inflammatory disease. None of the cancer patients exhibited signs of
metastases or reported excessive, unintended recent weight loss. Unlike in other
bariatric centres, bariatric patients were not subjected to a weight loss regimen
before surgery, but were commended to adhere to a regular meal pattern and take a
multi-vitamin and mineral supplement 4 weeks before bariatric intervention,
minimizing confounding effects of negative weight balance. Anthropometric and
clinical data describing the study cohort are listed in Supplementary Table S4.
Surgical resection specimens, VAT, abdominal SAT, liver biopsies and blood were
immediately placed on ice and subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored in liquid nitrogen or at  80 C.
For detailed analyses, gender-matched subgroups including non-obese non￾diabetic subjects (controls), obese non-diabetic subjects (obese) and obese subjects
with T2D (obese-diabetic) were selected from the total cohort. To reduce the age
gap between obese subjects (mostly morbidly obese, bariatric patients) and non￾obese subjects (mostly cancer patients) the youngest obese patients (age o33 years)
and the oldest non-obese patients (age 470 years) were excluded from the sub￾groups. Eventually, colorectal cancer (n ¼ 15) and sigma-diverticulosis (n ¼ 4)
patients were selected as the control group. Most control subjects had no signs of
overt inflammation, with only three individuals exhibiting elevated C-reactive
protein (Z5 mg ml  1, range 7.6–14.4 mg ml  1). See Table 1 for anthropometric
and clinical data characterizing the subgroups.
A separate population was used to investigate changes after bariatric surgery.
Abdominal SAT resection specimens were obtained from 20 patients (15 females,
5 males) during bariatric surgery performed at Maastricht University Hospital,
The Netherlands, from 2005–2010. Procedures were gastric bypass (n ¼ 9), gastric
banding (n ¼ 4), gastric sleeve (n ¼ 3), biliopancreatic diversion (n ¼ 3) and
Scopinaro (n ¼ 1). Post-weight loss of abdominal SAT samples were taken from
the same patients by excision 6 months (n ¼ 7), 12 months (n ¼ 10) or 24 months
(n ¼ 3) after bariatric surgery. All samples were taken in the fasted state and frozen
immediately in liquid nitrogen before storage at  80 C. Patients with type 1
diabetes, inflammatory diseases, and patients using anti-inflammatory drugs
and/or reported alcohol consumption (more than 10 g per day) were excluded from
the study.
All blood samples were taken in fasted state before surgery and parameters were
measured by routine methods in the clinical chemistry laboratories of Ulm and
Maastricht University Hospitals. Liver steatosis (% of hepatocytes with visible
lipid droplets) was estimated by the analysis of haematoxylin–eosin-stained liver
specimens. In each case, permission was given from the local ethics committees in
Maastricht, The Netherlands, and Ulm, Germany, and informed consent in writing
was obtained from each subject.
Gene expression analysis. Total RNA was isolated and purified from tissue
specimens using NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey& Nagel). cDNA was synthe￾sized using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real￾time PCRs for indicated genes were performed on a 7900HT sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Assay-on-Demand primer-probe sets
supplied by Applied Biosystems and selected to recognize all RefSeq sequences and
a maximum of GenBank ESTs (Supplementary Table S5). The ChREBP-a TaqMan
assay (Hs00263027_m1) recognizes intron 1a. ChREBP-b expression was deter￾mined by SYBR green-based quantitative real-time PCR using an Mx3000P system
(Stratagene) and primers as published23 (forward: 50
-AGCGGATTCCAGGTGAG
G-30
, reverse: 50
-TTGTTCAGGCGGATCTTGTC-30
). Gene expression was
calculated as copy number per 104 copies of the housekeeper gene TATA binding
protein-associated factor 1 (abbreviated as copy no.).
Western blot analysis. Protein extraction and western blot analysis were per￾formed as described57. Briefly, frozen VAT (50–100 mg) or liver (30–50 mg)
biopsies were homogenized in 20 mM MOPS, 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 30 mM
sodium fluoride, 40 mM b-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% NP-40 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 20 min at either  3 C (VAT) or þ 4 C
(liver). The supernatant was then collected while carefully avoiding the lipid layer
on top and protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein quantification
kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein extracts were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gels
(Invitrogen) and blotted onto Immobilon FL PVDF (Millipore) membranes.
Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in Odyssey LI-COR
Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) 1:2 diluted in TBS and incubated in primary antibodies
in Blocking Buffer diluted 1:2 in TBS-T (0.1%) overnight at 4 C. Primary
antibodies against ACC (Cell Signaling Technology, dilution 1:1,000), FASN (BD
Bioscience, 1:1,000), Hsp 90 (BD Bioscience, 1:1,000), b-actin (Abcam, 1:10,000),
GLUT4 (Abcam, 1:2,000) and Hsc 70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:10,000) were
used. After three consecutive 5 min washes in TBS-T (0.1%), blots were incubated
with Dylight 680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Dylight 800-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (both Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking
buffer containing 0.1% TBS-T and 0.1% SDS. After three washes in TBS-T and a
final wash in TBS, the blots were scanned with the LI-COR Odyssey (LI-COR) and
quantified with Odyssey 3.0 software based on direct fluorescence measurement.
For quantification, proteins were normalized to b-actin.
Fatty acid profiling. Fatty acid composition in total lipid extracts of VAT was
determined by gas chromatography, as described previously58. Briefly, 250 ml of
butylhydroxytoluene (0.1 mol l  1 in methanol) and 6 ml of chloroform/methanol
(2/1, v/v) were added to B100 mg of tissue. After homogenization using an
Ultraturrax homogenizer, the samples were heated to 50 C for 30 min and
centrifuged (1,800 g, 5 min). Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by heating
100 ml of tissue extract, 2 ml methanol/toluene (4/1, v/v), 50 ml heptadecanoic acid
(200 mg ml  1 in methanol/toluene, 4/1) and 200 ml acetylchloride in a capped tube
for 1 h at 100 C. After cooling to room temperature, 5 ml of 6% sodium carbonate
and 1.6 ml of toluene were added. The mixture was centrifuged (1,800 g, 5 min)
and 150–200 ml of the upper layer was transferred to auto sampler vials. Gas
chromatography analyses were performed using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph
(Hewlett Packard) equipped with flame ionization detectors (Stationary phase:
DB-225 30 m  0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 mm; Agilent). Peak identification
and quantification was performed by comparing retention times and peak areas,
respectively, to standard chromatograms. All calculations are based on fatty acid
methyl ester values. Concentration of fatty acid species was calculated as mg%
(mg fatty acid species/100 mg total fatty acids).
Statistical methods. Association of FASN gene expression with BMI in the whole
cohort and apparent group effects were examined by ANCOVA, including gender
and age as well as two-way interaction terms of independent variables in the initial
models. Nonsignificant terms were hierarchically-backward eliminated as sug￾gested by Kleinbaum and Klein59. Significant effects of age and gender are denoted
in the results section when present. Bonferroni adjustment was applied in multiple
group comparisons. To account for multiple testing, the threshold for statistical
significance was set at P ¼ 0.05 divided by the number of statistical tests applied
(n ¼ 100, Po0.0005, main cohort; n ¼ 15, Po0.0033, bariatric intervention
cohort). Paired t-tests were conducted to compare parameters before and after
bariatric surgery. Data were transformed to natural logarithm when necessary to
achieve normal distribution and/or homoscedasticity. Fatty acid concentrations
were logit-transformed (ln[x/(100–x)]). IBM SPSS Statistics version 19 was used for
all statistical analyses.
