Abstract
Retinoid-dependent pathways play a central role in regulat￾ing cardiac morphogenesis. Recently, we characterized
gene-targeted RXRa 2/2 embryos, which display an atrial￾like ventricular phenotype with the development of heart
failure and lethality at embryonic day 14.5. To quantitate
the frequency and complexity of cardiac morphogenic de￾fects, we now use microdissection and scanning electron mi￾croscopy to examine 107 wild-type, heterozygous, and ho￾mozygous embryos at embryonic day 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5.
RXRa 2/2 embryos display complex defects, including
ventricular septal, atrioventricular cushion, and conotrun￾cal ridge defects, with double outlet right ventricle, aorti￾copulmonary window, and persistent truncus arteriosus. In
addition, heterozygous RXRa embryos display a predisposi￾tion for trabecular and papillary muscle defects, ventricular
septal defects, conotruncal ridge defects, atrioventricular
cushion defects, and pulmonic stenosis. Lastly, we show
that the intermediate anatomic phenotype displayed by het￾erozygous embryos is mirrored in the molecular marker
MLC-2a. The intermediate phenotype of RXRa heterozy￾gous embryos documents a gene dosage effect for RXRa in
maintaining normal cardiac morphogenesis. In addition,
some defects in RXRa mutant mice are phenocopies of human
congenital heart defects, thereby suggesting that a relative
deficiency in RXRa or molecules downstream in its signal￾ing pathway may represent congenital heart disease–sus￾ceptibility genes. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:1332–1343.) Key

Introduction
Congenital heart disease affects 1 in 200 live births in the
United States with a wide range of distinct phenotypes for
which there are few recognized candidate genes or even broad
molecular insights (1). The identification of the genetic deter￾minants of complex congenital heart disease has been con￾founded by its sporadic nature, incomplete penetrance with
variable clinical phenotypes, and presumptive polygenic,
multifactorial etiology. One approach to identifying genetic
determinants of congenital heart disease has been to examine
monogenic disorders that are associated with congenital malfor￾mations. This type of approach has been successful for supra￾valvular aortic stenosis, where the defect is apparently based
upon a deficiency in the elastin gene product (2). A number of
other genetic disorders are associated with cardiovascular de￾velopmental defects, such as Holt-Oram syndrome, Down’s
syndrome, and the microdeletions on chromosome 22 associ￾ated with DiGeorge syndrome (3–7). However, the precise
identity of the gene products in these syndromes is currently
unknown.
An alternative approach to identifying genes that may be
responsible for congenital heart disease is to examine the role
of candidate genes with murine gene–targeted models of car￾diogenesis. In this regard, recent studies have provided direct
evidence that retinoid signaling may be critical for the mainte￾nance of normal cardiac morphogenesis. Heart defects have
also been observed in animals fostered under conditions of vi￾tamin A deficiency, leading to defects in ventricular chamber
morphogenesis as well as multiple noncardiac effects (8–10).
Signals derived from vitamin A and its metabolites alter pat￾terns of gene expression through the action of retinoid recep￾tors, members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of
ligand-dependent transcription factors. These receptors com￾prise two distinct subfamilies composed of three retinoic acid
receptors (RARa, b, g)
1
 and three retinoic X receptors
(RXRa, b, g). These two groups share overlapping ligand
specificity since both receptors bind 9-cis retinoic acid with
high affinity, while only the RARs bind all-trans retinoic acid.
It has been shown in vitro that RXRs are able to bind DNA as
homodimers, whereas RARs as well as receptors for thyroid
hormone, vitamin D, and peroxisome proliferators form het￾erodimers with RXRs that bind DNA in a highly cooperative
fashion. Recently, the role of these receptors in cardiovascular
development has been explored through systematic gene tar￾geting of each member of the retinoid receptor family. While
mice with knockouts of the RARa (11, 12), RARb (13), or
RARg (14) genes display no obvious cardiovascular defects,
mice that contain double knockouts of RAR isoforms display
abnormalities of the aortic arches and outflow tract (15). In ad￾Address correspondence to Kenneth R. Chien, Professor of Medi￾cine, Department of Medicine, 0613-C, University of California, San

RXRa Deficiency Confers Genetic Susceptibility for Cardiac Defects in Mice 1333
dition, recent studies have documented that a single gene
knockout of the RXRa gene results in severe cardiac muscle
defects associated with a deficiency in expansion of the com￾pact zone and a consequent decrease in cardiac function (16,
17). The decrease in cardiac muscle mass results in embryonic
heart failure and lethality around embryonic day (ed) 14.5 as
assessed by miniaturized physiological technology in the living
embryo (18). This defect is similar to a subset of the cardiovas￾cular alterations seen in the setting of vitamin A deficiency,
suggesting that RXRa-dependent pathways are critical in the
maintenance of normal cardiac morphogenesis.
The question arises whether RXRa deficiency would pro￾duce an increased frequency of other complex cardiac mor￾phogenic defects that would lie in other tissue compartments
of the heart including the aortic sac, conotruncal ridges, atrio￾ventricular cushions, or subtle defects of ventricular morpho￾genesis. This type of study necessitates a rapid, quantitative
approach to score for all of the potentially complex malforma￾tions that could occur in each of these compartments during
various stages of murine cardiac morphogenesis. By examining
relatively large numbers of wild-type, heterozygous, and ho￾mozygous embryos, one can quantitatively score for the ap￾pearance of relatively infrequent yet severe cardiovascular
malformations that may arise as a result of variable levels of
RXRa deficiency. Additionally, one can determine whether
any of these resulting phenotypes resemble known cardiovas￾cular malformations in man. Using a rapid throughput micro￾dissection protocol in combination with scanning electron mi￾croscopy (19), we now report the detailed analysis of cardiac
morphogenic defects in RXRa-deficient embryos. Interest￾ingly, mice that are heterozygous for RXRa also display a
number of cardiac abnormalities, with defects in both cushion
mesenchyme, manifest as pulmonic stenosis and atrioventricu￾lar cushion defects, and muscle, manifest as right or left ven￾tricular hypoplasia and trabecular disarray. Additionally, we
identify a molecular marker MLC-2a whose expression mir￾rors the anatomic analysis in that its expression level is inter￾mediate between wild-type and homozygous embryos.
These studies indicate that there is a critical requirement
for RXRa, not only in the muscle compartment, but also in the
formation of the endocardial cushions of both the atrioventric￾ular region and the conotruncus. Thus, a knockout of a single
member of the retinoid receptor gene family can result in mul￾tiple defects to virtually every compartment of the developing
heart, implying a central role for RXRa in cardiac morphogen￾esis. To our knowledge, no other single gene-targeted event of
any of the other retinoid receptors has thus far been associated
with cardiovascular defects. This underscores a particularly
important role for RXRa in orchestrating and maintaining
normal cardiac morphogenesis. In addition, finding cardiac de￾fects in heterozygous embryos resembling forms of human
congenital malformations, such as pulmonic stenosis, cleft mi￾tral valve, and selective chamber dysplasia, implicates RXRa
as a possible candidate for conferring genetic susceptibility for
congenital heart disease phenotypes, and provides evidence
for a threshold effect for RXRa for activating specific steps of
cardiac morphogenesis.
Methods
Breeding and identification of gene-targeted mice. RXRa 2/2 mutant
mice in a C57/Bl6 background were maintained in colonies and bred
as described (16). The genotype of individual animals was determined
by PCR analysis of tail or hind limb DNA extracts. Briefly, tissue
samples were digested overnight in tail extraction buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0) with 80
mg/ml proteinase K. DNA was precipitated with an equal volume of
isopropanol and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to give a 600-bp band
by agarose gel electrophoresis for the wild-type allele and a 400-bp
band for the targeted allele.
Microdissection and scanning electron microscopy. Using pipettes
with sharply beveled tips (20), hearts of harvested embryos were fixed
in end-diastole by intraventricular high flow–low pressure perfusion
fixation (21) with 2% glutaraldehyde, 1% formaldehyde in 1% ca￾codylate buffer made isotonic with NaCl. Perfusion was followed by
immersion in the same fixative for storage. A standardized procedure for
microdissection and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of
the heart was applied (19). Using an operating microscope (Wild
M690; Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), the hearts were exposed and
examined. In the case of abnormal morphology, macrophotographs of
the frontal aspect as well as of the left and right profiles were taken with
a photomicroscope (Wild Photomacroscope M400; Leica, Heerbrugg,
Switzerland). In all specimens, the right ventricle was cut with crafted
microscissors proceeding from the apex into the pulmonary artery
trunk and the ductus arteriosus. Similarly, the left ventricle was cut
open from the apex towards the base of the heart and its internal re￾lief examined. The ventricular cavity and the conotruncus were scru￾tinized for anomalies and photographed. Subsequently, the parietal
and septal segments of the right ventricle as well as the parietal seg￾ment of the left ventricle were isolated by extending the previously
mentioned cuts of the right and left ventricles beyond the base of the
heart. These segments were submitted to ethanol dehydration and
critical point drying from Freon 113 to Freon 23 (CPD 030 apparatus;
Balzers S.p.A., Milan, Italy). Dried specimens were mounted on SEM
tubes, ion sputtered (S150; Edwards Co., Santa Ana, CA) with 300
nm gold, and examined in the scanning electron microscope (JSM
6300-F; JEOL U.S.A. Inc., Peabody, MA). SEM photomicrographs
were taken in standard orientations and magnifications. Primary
magnification of all photomacrographs was 203. Primary magnifica￾tion of scanning electron micrographs was 603. The genotype and
phenotype analyses were performed under double-blind conditions.
Linear measurements of right and left ventricular compact zone
thickness were made on prints of SEM photomicrographs using cali￾pers immediately inferior to the tricuspid and mitral orifices, respec￾tively. The precision of the measurements was 0.24 mm. A general￾ized linear model for analysis of variance using Chi squared and
Fischer’s exact test was performed with right and left ventricular
compact zone thickness as dependent variables and age, genotype,
and the presence, absence, or type of anomaly as sources of variation.
Whole heart in situ hybridization. Whole heart in situ hybridiza￾tion was performed using modifications of the procedure described
by Wilkinson (22). An atrial myosin light chain (MLC-2a) riboprobe
template was produced by AvaII restriction of a plasmid containing
the MLC-2a gene (AMLC210). A digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe
was generated using T7 polymerase and the 103 DIG RNA labeling
mixture obtained from Boerhinger Mannheim Biochemicals (India￾napolis, IN) and used per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Embryonic hearts were dissected free from surrounding tissues
and further dissected to remove the apices of the right and left ventri￾cles and the right and left atria (thus reducing trapping of the color
precipitate). The specimens were fixed overnight at 48C in 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS before sequential 5-min washes at room tem￾perature (RT) in PBS, PBS, 25, 50, 75, 100, 100, 75, 50, and 25%
methanol, and PBT (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) twice. Embryos were
bleached for 1 h at RT with 6% hydrogen peroxide/PBS followed by
three PBT washes. Digestion for 10 min at 378C with 15 mg/ml pro￾teinase VIII was followed by 5-min washes in 2 mg/ml glycine/PBS,
and three times in PBT. Embryos were prehybridized at 708C for at
least 6 h with hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide/53

SSC, pH 4.5, 50 mg/ml yeast RNA, 50 mg/ml heparin, 1% SDS) before
replacing the solution along with the addition of riboprobe at 1 mg/
ml; hybridization took place for 20–36 h at 708C. Sequential 15-min
washes were performed with solution 1 (53 SSC, pH 4.5, 50% for￾mamide, 1% SDS) at 708C three times, 1:1 mix of solution 1 and so￾lution 2 (0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween-20) at
708C twice, and solution 2 three times at RT. RNase digestion was
performed in solution 2 at 378C with 75 mg/ml RNase A and 75 mg/ml
RNase T1 twice for 30 min. Sequential 15-min washes were then per￾formed at RT with solution 2, and twice with solution 3 (50% forma￾mide, 23 SSC, pH 4.5) before a 30-min wash at 658C with solution 3.
Embryos were then rinsed three times at RT in TBST (0.8 g NaCl,
0.02 g KCl, 2.5 ml 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 ml 10% Tween-20, 4 mM
Levamisole) and then blocked for 1 h at RT with 10% normal sheep
serum (NSS)/TBST. Alkaline phosphatase–conjugated antidigoxige￾nin sheep Fab fragments (Boerhinger Mannheim Biochemicals)
were used to detect the hybridized transcripts; this was diluted at
1:2,000 in 2% NSS/TBST and incubated with the embryos at 48C for
16–24 h.
Sequential, 1-h, postantibody washes were performed at RT five
times with TBST, followed by five 10-min washes at RT with NTMT
(100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 25 mM MgCl2
, 0.1%
Tween-20, 4 mM Levamisole). The color reaction was performed at
RT with 4.5 ml 75 mM nitro blue tetrazolium (Boerhinger Mannheim
Biochemicals) and 3.5 ml 75 mM X-phosphate (Boerhinger Mann￾heim Biochemicals) until an intense blue color appeared. The reac￾tion was stopped in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and
embryos postfixed for 2 h at RT in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS.
Specimens were photographed with a stereomicroscope (SV6;
Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and slides digitized. Figures were
composed in Adobe Photoshop 3.0, QuarkXPress 3.31, and printed
by Fujix Pictography (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Ribonuclease protection assays. RNase protection assays were
performed per the manufacturer’s recommendations using the Direct
Protect Lysate Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit from Ambion, Inc.
(Austin, TX). Left ventricular free wall samples were dissected from
individual day 13.5 embryonic hearts and placed in 50 ml of lysis solu￾tion at room temperature for 5 min. Samples were then vortexed to lyse
the tissue and stored at 2208C. For the assessment of the expression
of the mouse MLC-2a gene, a 355-bp probe (285-bp protected frag￾ment using T7 polymerase) was generated by AvaII restriction of a
plasmid containing the MLC-2a gene (AMLC210). For the assess￾ment of the expression of the mouse ventricular myosin light chain
gene, a 230-bp probe (169-bp protected fragment using T7 poly￾merase) was generated by Sau3AI restriction of a plasmid containing
the MLC-2v gene (MLC510). The expression of elongation factor 1a
(EF1a) was used as a loading control and a 140-bp probe (100-bp pro￾tected fragment using SP6 polymerase) was generated by DdeI restric￾tion of a plasmid containing the EF1a. Riboprobes were generated
using the MAXIscript In Vitro Transcription kit from Ambion, Inc. per
the manufacturer’s recommendations. 1 mg of template was used in each
synthesis reaction with fragments labeled by [32P]CTP and purified on
an 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. Samples in lysis solution were
hybridized with 100,000 cpm of the purified probe at 378C overnight.
The unprotected RNA was subsequently digested with RNases A and
T1 at 378C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with sarcosyl and
proteinase K, and the reaction mixture precipitated with 0.6 vol 100%
isopropanol. The RNase-resistant hybrids were analyzed by gel elec￾trophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel. The gel was
dried and autoradiography performed until a signal was detected.

RXRa Deficiency Confers Genetic Susceptibility for Cardiac Defects in Mice 1335
Results
Aorticopulmonary septum and cushion tissue mesenchyme de￾fects in RXRa 2/2 embryos. Examination of 18 RXRa ho￾mozygous null embryos by microdissection and SEM revealed
multiple phenotypes in four distinct compartments of the
heart: aortic sac (that area of the ventricular outflow tract
above the semilunar valves), conotruncus (that area of the
ventricular outflow tract below the semilunar valves), atrio￾ventricular cushions (mesenchymal tissue dividing the atrial
and ventricular chambers), and ventricular myocardium. Table
I lists the defects found in each of the distinct tissue types for
each RXRa genotype.
Defects in normal septation of the aortic sac are related to
abnormalities in formation of the aorticopulmonary septum.
Figs. 1 and 2 schematically diagram the normal maturation of
each tissue compartment. Fig. 1, A is a representation of an ed
10.5 mouse embryonic heart in which complete septation of
the aortic sac has not yet occurred. Fig. 1, B diagrams an ed
14.5 mouse embryonic heart in which migration of the aorti￾copulmonary septum has completely divided the supravalvular
ventricular outflow tract into the aorta and main pulmonary
artery. Fig. 3 shows examples of the major findings with the
first column demonstrating normal specimens, the second col￾umn defects of intermediate severity, and the third column the
most severe defects. Incomplete formation or migration of
aorticopulmonary septum tissue results in either aorticopul￾monary window in the partial case or persistent truncus arteri￾osus (PTA) in the complete case. Though relatively infre￾quent, RXRa homozygous embryos demonstrated both
aorticopulmonary window (28%, Fig. 3 b) and PTA (11%, Fig.
3 c). Compared to wild type embryos (Fig. 3 a), the extent of
aorticopulmonry septum migration as indicated by the solid
arrow is reduced. Defects in the aortic sac are the least fre￾quent abnormalities seen as only seven embryos displayed ab￾normalities in this tissue compartment.
The subvalvular ventricular outflow tract septates in a com￾plex series of events that begin as the formation of cushion
Figure 1. Critical structures in cardiac development. Four distinct tissue compartments of the heart develop via distinct mechanisms. (1) The 
aorticopulmonary septum exists as a migrating mass of neural crest–derived cells. The distal boundary of its migration lies somewhat below the 
level of the semilunar valves. (2) The conotruncal cushions begin as a pair of spiral mesenchymal swellings in the primordial ventricular outflow 
tract, eventually fusing to form the conotruncal septum. This divides the subvalvular outflow tract and contributes to the membranous interven￾tricular septum. (3) The atrioventricular cushions, like the conotruncal cushions, begin as a pair of mesenchymal swellings in the atrioventricular 
canal, which connects the common atrium with the common ventricle. The fusion of these cushions along with the contribution of atrial struc￾tures (not shown) contribute to the septation of the common atrioventricular canal into the right (tricuspid) and left (mitral) atrioventricular or￾ifices. (4 and 5) The myocardium begins as a single layer of cells beneath the epicardium. These proliferate and differentiate into the expanded 
compact zone and specialized myocardial tissue trabeculae from which papillary muscles form. Ao, aorta; PA, pulmonary artery; LA, left atrium;

structures derived through interactions between the myocar￾dium and endocardium. The parietal and septal conotruncal
ridges form in a spiral fashion (Fig. 1 A) and eventually fuse to
create a structure called the conotruncal septum, normally di￾viding the conotruncus into the right (pulmonary artery) and
left (aorta) ventricular outflow tracts (Figs. 1 B and 3 d) by ed
12.5. 100% of RXRa homozygous null mutants have abnor￾malities of conotruncal ridges ranging from mild deficiency of
conotruncal tissue (6%, Fig. 3 e, indicated by the short double￾headed arrow) to complete absence of cushion tissue (66%,
Fig. 3 f, normal position indicated by a dotted, double headed
arrow). A portion of embryos with shortened conotruncal
ridges precisely mimicked the human condition of ventricular
septal defect (VSD)–type double outlet right ventricle
(DORV) (17%, Fig. 3 e). Deficiencies of the aorticopulmonary
septum and conotruncus were not coincident, suggesting that
mutually exclusive mechanisms may be responsible for their
formation.
The atrioventricular cushions, along with atrial structures,
are responsible for dividing the atrioventricular canal into
right (tricuspid) and left (mitral) orifices. They arise, as do the
conotruncal ridges, from interactions between the muscle and
endocardium resulting in transformation into mesenchymal
cushions (Fig. 1 A) and definitively into mature valvular struc￾tures (Figs. 1 B and 2 A). However, incomplete formation or
fusion of the atrioventricular cushions can result in defects
ranging from small clefts in valve leaflets (Fig. 2 B) to com￾plete lack of atrioventricular septation and atrioventricular ca￾nal (Fig. 2 C). RXRa homozygous embryos exhibit the entire
spectrum of severities. Deficiencies of the atrioventricular
cushions range from cleft mitral valve (17%, Fig. 3 f) and cleft
tricuspid valve (17%) to common atrioventricular canal and
complete lack of fusion of the superior and inferior atrioven￾tricular cushions (39%, Fig. 3, h and i). Intermediate were 12
embryos (67%) with partial fusion of the atrioventricular cush￾ions. However, even in those animals in which a common atrio￾ventricular canal was seen, primordial cushion tissue was al￾ways observed (Fig. 3 i), suggesting that the defect is a result of
cushion growth, maturation, or fusion deficiency rather than
interference with their initial induction. This is in marked con￾trast to the conotruncus, in which all cushion tissue was occa￾sionally absent (Fig. 3 f).
Myocardial architecture defects in RXRa 2/2 embryos.
The myocardium expands from a thin layer of cells beneath
the epicardium to form a thicker compact zone of muscle (Fig.
1, A and B). Additionally, some myocytes form specialized
structures called trabeculae that project across portions of the
ventricular cavity. The transition zone between these two tis￾sues is called the spongy layer. In RXRa homozygous em￾bryos, the ventricular myocardium was the most frequently
and severely affected tissue type. It has been noted previously
(16, 17), resulting in a hypoplastic compact zone (94%, Fig. 4
b) and isolated ventricular septal defect (94%, Fig. 4 c). How￾ever, ventricular septal defects were not only confined to the
membranous septum (a structure largely derived from the fu￾sion of three tissues—conotruncal septum, atrioventricular
cushion, and ventricular septum), but sometimes also included
the muscular portion, resulting in large interventricular de￾fects. All defects listed in Table I as ventricular septal defects
were muscular. Additionally, defects in the spongy and trabec￾ulated layers of the myocardium occurred frequently. The
spongy layer of the myocardium was generally thicker in mu￾tant embryos (Fig. 4 b) than in wild-type embryos (Fig. 4 a).
Trabeculae were attenuated (67%, Fig. 4 f) and contained an
unusual, random branching pattern as compared with the
more parallel branching pattern found in normal embryos.
Papillary muscles joining atrioventricular valvular leaflets to
the ventricular wall likely develop as specialized trabeculae.
Not surprisingly, dysmorphic papillary muscles were often ob￾served (56%, Fig. 4 e).

RXRa Deficiency Confers Genetic Susceptibility for Cardiac Defects in Mice 1337
Cardiac anomalies in heterozygous RXRa embryos. We hypo￾thesized that subtle defects in the heterozygous-deficient back￾ground may also exist and therefore proceeded to characterize
60 heterozygous embryos; the results are listed in Table I with
examples shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Abnormalities at each devel￾opmental age are seen in all cardiac tissue types, although less
frequent and generally less severe than homozygous embryos.
Defects in aortic sac septation are extremely rare as only a sin￾gle case of pulmonary artery stenosis (2%, Fig. 5 d) was ob￾served. Moreover, this likely arose as a secondary, hemody￾namically mediated phenomenon subsequent to abnormal
conotruncus septation. In this particular embryo, the parietal

conotruncal ridge was hyperplastic, thereby leading to right
ventricular outflow tract obstruction with the resulting reduc￾tion in flow likely responsible for the stenotic pulmonary ar￾tery. Conotruncal defects were observed in 15% of heterozy￾gous-deficient embryos, with severity ranging from absent
conotruncal ridges (3%, Fig. 5 e) to a shortened conotruncal
septum (7%) with VSD-type DORV (5%). Deficiencies of the
atrioventricular cushions were more frequent than those in the
conotruncus and ranged from absent fusion (3%) and hypo￾plasia (8%) to abnormalities of mature valvular structures,
such as cleft mitral valve (17%, Fig. 5 f), mitral valve stenosis
(2%, Fig. 6 b), and tricuspid valve abnormalities (8%).
The myocardium was again the most widely affected tissue
type resulting in both trabecular (49%) and papillary muscle
defects (86%). Close examination of right and left ventricular
compact zone (Table II) surprisingly demonstrated an inter￾mediate thickness especially prominent at ed 13.5 and 14.5. In
the case of left ventricular wall thickness, there is a significant
relationship (P , 0.03) between wall thickness and the pres￾ence of a cardiac malformation. Severe thinning of the ventric￾ular wall, dubbed “papyraceous phenotype,” was seen in both
the left (2%, Fig. 6 b) and right (2%, Fig. 6 c) ventricles, but
never simultaneously. Papyraceous left ventricle was associ￾ated with mitral valve stenosis yet a perfectly normal right ven￾tricle and semilunar valves. Similarly, papyraceous right ven￾tricle was associated with a dysmorphic tricuspid valve yet
normal left-sided and semilunar structures. In general, trabec￾ular arrangement was less organized in heterozygous embryos
than in wild-type embryos.

in heterozygous embryos implies the existence of molecular
correlates. Normally the expression of the structural gene
MLC-2a follows a pattern in which the gene is expressed
throughout the heart until ed 11.0, at which point it is specifi￾cally down regulated in the ventricle. However, in RXRa 2/2
embryos, expression of this gene is dysregulated in that expres￾sion is maintained to a high level in the ventricle after ed 11.0.

mediate thickness of the compact zone, we asked the question
if the intermediate anatomical phenotypes were reflected in an
intermediate level of MLC-2a.
To precisely delineate the normal expression pattern of
MLC-2a, we used whole mount in situ procedures. Usually,
these are difficult to perform for embryos older than ed 10.0;
however, by the introduction of small modifications in the pro￾cedure and the combination of microdissection, we were able
to perform whole heart in situ with good fidelity up to ed 14.0.
Fig. 7 demonstrates MLC-2a whole heart expression patterns
from embryos from wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous
RXRa embryos. Homozygous embryos show increased ex￾pression of MLC-2a throughout the ventricles, both right and
left, compared to wild-type embryos. Interestingly, heterozy￾gous embryos display an intermediate expression level. This
reflects the intermediate anatomic phenotypic severity seen in
both ventricular wall thickness and atrioventricular valvular
morphology. In addition, among heterozygous embryos, ex￾pression of MLC-2a is variable, though always higher than
wild-type embryos and lower than homozygous embryos. This
again reflects the anatomic analysis in which there exists large
phenotypic variability.
Although whole heart in situ appears to be a valid tech￾nique for spatial localization of transcripts in post–ed 10.0
hearts, it is poorly quantitative. To fully characterize MLC-2a
expression levels, we performed RNase protection assays on
left ventricular free wall samples to examine quantitative
MLC-2a gene expression in each genotype. Protection assays
were performed on single heart tissue samples in order to re￾duce variability that may be introduced at various steps of
RNA isolation or processing. Embryonic hearts from litter￾mates were dissected free from constitutive MLC-2a–express￾ing cardiac tissues; i.e., ventricular outflow tracts and atria.
RNase protection assays were simultaneously performed on
these samples using riboprobes for MLC-2a and the internal
control, EF-1a. The results of these experiments are shown in
Fig. 8. As seen in both the anatomical analysis and the molecular
spatial analysis, heterozygous embryos display an intermediate
level of MLC-2a expression between wild-type and homozy￾gous embryos. Lane 1 shows a wild-type embryo, lanes 2–7
heterozygotes, and lane 8, a homozygote. Riboprobes protect
transcripts from the MLC-2a gene (upper band) and structural
protein EF-1a gene (lower band). EF-1a expression level was
independent of genotype and unchanged, while MLC-2a ex￾pression levels segregated with genotype. Homozygous embryos
demonstrated a more than twofold increase in normalized ex￾pression level over homozygous embryos, while heterozygous
embryos had an intermediate expression level in agreement
with the whole heart in situ data. Due to the morphologically
destructive nature of both the microdissection/SEM and
RNase protection assays, we were unable to correlate MLC-2a
expression levels with severity of anatomic phenotype.
Therefore, we have shown that the structural gene MLC-2a
is a quantitative molecular marker for the heterozygous phe￾Figure 7. Whole heart (posterior

notype with an intermediate expression level between wild￾type and homozygous embryos. In addition, these findings fur￾ther strengthen the hypothesis that RXRa gene dosage plays
an important role in determining the structural phenotype of
the developing heart.
Discussion
RXRa deficiency produces multiple defects in the aortic sac,
conotruncal ridges and atrioventricular cushions, and ventricu￾lar chamber. By analyzing a large number (107) of the wild￾type and RXRa gene–targeted embryos with a combination of
systematic microdissection and SEM to diagnose and quantita￾tively score all the potential morphogenic defects in each car￾diac compartment, we have uncovered a large array of cardiac
abnormalities in RXRa-deficient murine embryos (Fig. 9).
Within the ventricular chambers, SEM provides clear evi￾dence, not only of the previously described defect in expansion
of the compact zone, but also of defects in trabecular morpho￾genesis achieving neither the appropriate orientation nor
thickness to form mature trabeculae. These studies imply that
RXRa may play an important role not only in expansion of the
compact zone, but also in controlling the entire process of tra￾becular morphogenesis, which is likely to be a critical step in
chamber development. Accompanying these ventricular mus￾cle abnormalities were widespread defects in other tissue com￾partments within the heart. In the outflow tract, neural crest
migration and cushion tissue mesenchyme formation are both
required for normal septation, resulting in the formation of the
aortic and pulmonary outflow tracts. Some RXRa homozy￾gous-deficient embryos demonstrated PTA (11%) with largely
deficient aorticopulmonary septation, yet in the absence of any
other signs indicative of a more generalized neural crest defi￾ciency (i.e., aortic arch abnormalities). More frequently
(28%), an aorticopulmonary window was found that results in
a partial communication between the great vessels above the
level of the semilunar valves. The mechanism responsible for
the aorticopulmonary septum defects is unclear, but is unlikely
to be due to widespread defects in neural crest formation or
migration, which are not seen in the RXRa 2/2 background.
Thus, these studies suggest a specific requirement for RXRa in
the formation of aortic sac mesenchyme. However, the possi￾bility exists that the neighboring ventricular muscle cells that
lie in the subvalvular region might also somehow be important
for sending appropriate cues for the septation of the proximal
region of the aortic sac. One of the major questions will be to
determine whether there are separate requirements for RXRa
in the formation of cardiac mesenchyme and muscle, and the
potential relationships between these important events during
heart morphogenesis. One could explore the presumptive cell
autonomous nature of the myocardial defect by transplanting
mutant cells into wild-type embryos and looking for rescue of
the cellular phenotype; these studies are currently underway.
This primary myocardial cell hypothesis is further strength￾ened by the observation that defects in the outflow tract are
rare, and these tissues are not known to be influenced by the
myocardium.
A similar requirement for RXRa in the formation of
conotruncal ridges and atrioventricular cushion was also ob￾served. DORV, which in the VSD form occurs due to hypopla￾sia of the conotruncal ridges, represented a phenocopy of the
specific pathology seen in man. Atrioventricular endocardial
cushion defects were also observed due to lack of fusion of the
superior and inferior endocardial cushions. Taken together,
the range of defects seen in the aorticopulmonary septum,
conotruncal ridges, and atrioventricular cushions indicate that
Figure 9. Developmental defects in RXRa gene-targeted embryos. In 
RXRa gene-targeted embryos, defects exist in all four tissue compart￾ments of the heart. (1) Deficiency of the aorticopulmonary septum 
can be due to either incomplete formation (aorticopulmonary win￾dow) or absence (persistent truncus arteriosus). (2) Defects of the 
conotruncal cushions are manifest as incomplete formation of the 
conotruncal septum resulting in incomplete subvalvular septation of 
the outflow tract–resulting double outlet right ventricle. (3) Atrioven￾tricular cushion defects ranged from severe incomplete fusion result￾ing in a common atrioventricular canal to mild defects such as a cleft 
mitral or tricuspid valve. (4) The myocardium manifested multiple 
defects including trabecular disarray, ventricular septal defects, and 
hypoplastic compact zone, either bi- or univentricular.

there may be an RXRa requirement not only for ventricular
chamber expansion in the compact zone and appropriate myo￾cardial architecture development, but also for the morphogen￾esis of nonmuscle compartments.
The question arises as to whether these various defects in
each of the cardiac segments (aortic sac, conotruncus, atrio￾ventricular cushion, and ventricular chamber) represent single
or distinct requirements for RXRa-dependent pathways. The
ventricular chamber defect is associated with maturational ar￾rest of ventricular muscle cells within the RXRa 2/2embryos
that is manifest by the persistent expression of an atrial marker
(MLC-2a) (18). The timing of this block in ventricular matura￾tion places a requirement for RXRa between ed 10.0- and 12.0,
just around the time of the decrease in cardiac chamber func￾tion in these embryos (18). Interestingly, this is just after initia￾tion of aortic sac and atrioventricular canal septation. The latter
structure results from an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transfor￾mation based upon initial cues from the overlying myocar￾dium. In both mouse and man, the conotruncal ridges are two
structures that arise in the proximal portion of the outflow
tract. This subvalvular septation of the outflow tract is respon￾sible for directing the flow of blood from the left ventricle to
the aorta and the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and is
due to fusion of the conotruncal ridges. Lack of fusion of the
conotruncal ridges results in incomplete formation of the
conotruncal septum resulting in DORV. The atrioventricular
cushions bear a phenotype similar to those of the conotruncus.
Again, in the majority of cases, formation of primordial cush￾ion tissue is initiated; however, the further development of this
tissue appears defective in the RXRa 2/2 embryos. Since the
initial molecular cues for cushion formation are derived from
neighboring cardiac muscle cells, the possibility exists that the
cushion defects arise, in part, due to a primary defect in the
cardiac muscle cell. If such is the case, the defects in the cush￾ion tissue mesenchyme might arise as a result of a requirement
for RXRa, not in the endocardial or mesenchymal cells per se,
but in the neighboring muscle cells that fail to elicit an appro￾priate signal. Alternatively, the defect may be secondary to in￾complete fusion of the cushions.
RXRa heterozygous deficiency confers genetic susceptibility
for cardiac morphogenic defects. To date, evidence for cardiac
defects in mice that are heterozygous deficient for an individ￾ual member of the retinoid gene family have not been de￾scribed. To our knowledge, the RXRa 2/2 mice embryos are
the only single gene–targeted embryos within the retinoid re￾ceptor gene family that display cardiac defects. Although com￾bined double and triple knockouts of other receptors result in
cardiac defects, these defects have not occurred in embryos
harboring deficiencies in only a single member of the retinoid
receptor gene family (11–17). As such, RXRa appears to play
a particularly important role in cardiac morphogenesis. This
result was underscored by the findings in the current study,
which surprisingly uncovered an intermediate phenotype in
heterozygous embryos. While these embryos display normal
ventricular function at ed 14.5, they nevertheless provide evi￾dence of an intermediate phenotype in the ventricular cham￾ber morphology, manifested by a compact zone of intermedi￾ate thickness, and aberrant trabecular architecture. In fact, in
some embryos, complete absence of the papillary muscles was
noted. Selective hypoplasia of either the left or right ventricu￾lar chamber was also evident.
In addition to defects in ventricular muscle, there was also
clear-cut evidence of atrioventricular cushion defects that
ranged from complete atrioventricular canal to cleft mitral
valve, an indication of abnormal or incomplete fusion of the
superior and inferior atrioventricular cushions. The ventricular
chamber displayed the most sensitivity to RXRa deficiency, as
the majority of heterozygous-deficient embryos displayed a
defect. However, malformations of the atrioventricular cush￾ion, conotruncal region, and in the aortic sac were variable, im￾plying that relative RXRa deficiency confers genetic suscepti￾bility for these morphogenic defects. These observations in the
heterozygous-deficient RXRa 1/2 embryos suggest a thresh￾old effect for RXRa actions in these distinct regions of the de￾veloping heart, again implying that there may be multiple spa￾tial and temporal requirements for RXRa within each one of
these cardiac compartments. As such, RXRa may play a par￾ticularly important role in coordinating several events during
the course of cardiac morphogenesis. Alternatively, a relative
deficiency in RXRa might increase the propensity for these
cardiac malformations through retinoid-dependent pathways.
This particular scenario is analogous to the proposed role of
p53 in which deficiency confers susceptibility to multiple, dis￾tinct oncologic phenotypes while determining specificity for
none (23). Similarly, RXRa confers genetic susceptibility for
multiple congenital heart disease phenotypes by disturbing
normal development in four distinct structures of the heart,
aorticopulmonary septum, conotruncal ridges, atrioventricular
cushions, and ventricular myocardium.
RXRa deficiency produces phenocopies of congenital heart
disease in man. Since complete RXRa deficiency in the ho￾mozygous embryos is associated with midgestation embryonic
lethality, it is unlikely that this homozygous-deficient genotype
accounts for a substantial fraction of surviving congenital heart
disease. However, finding that the heterozygous-deficient
RXRa 1/2 embryos can display an array of congenital heart
phenotypes suggests the possibility that RXRa, components of
its downstream signaling pathway, or their targets may play an
important role in the etiology of congenital heart disease in
man. On one hand, they may play a role in conferring genetic
susceptibility through genes that either modify the phenotype
or are responsible for the particular congenital heart disease
phenotype. Alternatively, the defects might arise primarily
through a complete or relative deficiency in RXRa. Since
RXRa exerts its effects primarily through the regulation of
downstream target genes, the possibility exists that the target
genes themselves may play a particularly important role in
producing these congenital heart disease phenotypes. In this
regard, we have already isolated a number of candidate genes
by subtraction cloning that are inappropriately expressed in
RXRa 2/2 embryos, and are in the process of identifying
whether these are indeed aberrantly expressed in the region of
embryos that display specific cardiac anomalies. It will be in￾teresting to directly examine this possibility in cases of congen￾ital heart disease in man that are not ascribed to other genetic
backgrounds, such as Down’s syndrome, CATCH-22, or Holt￾Oram syndrome. Since sporadic cases account for a large num￾ber of congenital heart disease cases, the possibility also exists
that RXRa or components of its downstream signaling path￾way may play a role in these instances. The availability of this
model system should be instrumental in allowing the eventual
identification of components of the RXRa signaling pathway
that may play important roles in the onset of these specific car￾diac malformations (Ruiz-Lozano, P., S.W. Kubalak, H.M. Su-

cov, R.M. Evans, and K.R. Chien, unpublished results). Un￾derstanding the potential role of genetic background possibly
in combination with maternal nutrient status in the production
of these various defects can also be explained in the mouse
model system. This study also underscores the utility of using
appropriate approaches to score for the frequency, severity,
and complexity of congenital heart disease phenotypes in an
efficient fashion, and should prove useful in analyzing other
gene-targeted embryos that harbor cardiovascular anomalies.
