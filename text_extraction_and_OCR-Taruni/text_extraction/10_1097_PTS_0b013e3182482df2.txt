Abstract
ABSTRACT: Cirrhosis and chronic liver disease are common
illnesses that cause high mortality and require treatment.
Medication use in these patients may be challenging because of
idiosyncratic or dose-dependent drug toxicity. Therefore, drug
choice and drug dose adaptations play an important role. The
objective of this clinical review is to discuss the literature about and
challenges in drug use in patients with chronic liver disease.To
make good decisions regarding drug choice and dose adjustments in
these patients, well-defined clinical information about diagnoses
and laboratory results (creatinine, international normalized ratio,


bilirubin, and serologies) as well as in some instances, pathological
findings like liver biopsies are needed. In a second step, these data
should be organized in electronically supported clinical decision
systems, which can then assist providers in making choices about
medication selection and dosage.In summary, although substantial
research has been done in the field of drug use in patients with liver
dysfunction, a great deal also remains to be learned. Although many
of these patients can now be identified, it is still very difficult to
assess their individual level of hepatic function. The degree of risk
associated with drug use and how best to use medications in these
patients represents an important area for further study. In the
future, pharmacogenomics and electronic linking of clinical data
may well prove helpful for making decisions about optimal drug
choices in this complex group of patients.
