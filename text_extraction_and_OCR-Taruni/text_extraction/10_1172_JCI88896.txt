Introduction
Fibrogenesis in the transplanted organ is the predominant cause of 
allograft failure and death across all solid organs. By 5 years after 
transplantation, 50% of lung transplant recipients develop chronic 
graft failure, with evidence of a progressive obstructive ventilato￾ry defect termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) arising 
from fibrotic obliteration of the small airways or bronchiolitis 
obliterans (BO) (1). Graft injury arising from various mechanisms, 
including allo- and autoimmune insults, microvascular ischemia, 
and infectious agents, is presumed to drive mesenchymal cell 
infiltration and collagen deposition, which characterize a failing 
graft. While previously considered as rather generic effector cells, 
mesenchymal cells (MCs) are now being increasingly recognized 
for their organ-specific transcriptome (2). We have demonstrated 
that graft-resident lung-specific mesenchymal stromal cells play a 
pathogenic role in BOS, with evidence for their presence in fibrot￾ic lesions and their mobilization preceding BOS (2–4). A stable 
fibrotic phenotype marked by increased matrix synthetic function 
is noted in MCs isolated from BOS lungs (4). Persistent activation 
of MCs even after these cells are removed from their local milieu is 
also seen in other fibrotic diseases and provides an explanation for 
the progressive nature of fibrosis (5, 6). However, although MCs 
are increasingly recognized for their secretory functions (7), the 
mechanisms of autocrine regulation of MC fibrotic differentiation 
remain to be elucidated.
β-Catenin, an integral cell-cell adhesion adaptor protein and 
a transcriptional coregulator, has been recently identified to be 
important in MC activation (8–12). β-Catenin stabilization in MCs 
in transgenic mice is sufficient to promote spontaneous fibrotic 
lesions (9). Transient β-catenin activation in MCs marks normal 
wound healing; persistent β-catenin activation is noted in MCs of 
hyperplastic skin lesions and other human fibrotic diseases (8, 10). 
However, mechanisms of β-catenin regulation in MCs in tissue 
fibrosis have not been identified. While the best-known activator 
of β-catenin is WNT1, recent studies indicate a role for various 
other ligands and receptors, including GPCRs, in activation of the 
β-catenin pathway (13, 14). We have previously demonstrated that 
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acting via ligation of LPA receptor 1 
(LPA1) induces cytoplasmic accumulation, nuclear translocation, 
and transcriptional activation of β-catenin in human lung-resident 
mesenchymal stromal cells (15). LPA, a bioactive lipid mediator 
produced from extracellular lysophosphatidylcholine by autotaxin 
(ATX), a secreted lysophospholipase D, has been shown to have an 
important role in tissue fibrosis (16–19). However, it is not known 
whether LPA acts as a ligand for β-catenin activation in regulating 
tissue fibrosis and what role it plays in lung allograft fibrogenesis.
Here, we investigate the upstream signaling nexus that induces 
persistent β-catenin activation and the fibrotic phenotype of MCs 
in BOS. We identify an autocrine loop linking nuclear factor of acti￾vated T cells 2 (NFAT1) to β-catenin via NFAT1 regulation of ATX 
expression and subsequent LPA1 signaling. Furthermore, we ascer￾tain the in vivo relevance of this signaling axis in allograft fibrogene￾Tissue fibrosis is the primary cause of long-term graft failure after organ transplantation. In lung allografts, progressive 
terminal airway fibrosis leads to an irreversible decline in lung function termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). 
Here, we have identified an autocrine pathway linking nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFAT1), autotaxin (ATX), 
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and β-catenin that contributes to progression of fibrosis in lung allografts. Mesenchymal cells 
(MCs) derived from fibrotic lung allografts (BOS MCs) demonstrated constitutive nuclear β-catenin expression that was 
dependent on autocrine ATX secretion and LPA signaling. We found that NFAT1 upstream of ATX regulated expression of 
ATX as well as β-catenin. Silencing NFAT1 in BOS MCs suppressed ATX expression, and sustained overexpression of NFAT1
increased ATX expression and activity in non-fibrotic MCs. LPA signaling induced NFAT1 nuclear translocation, suggesting 
that autocrine LPA synthesis promotes NFAT1 transcriptional activation and ATX secretion in a positive feedback loop. In an 
in vivo mouse orthotopic lung transplant model of BOS, antagonism of the LPA receptor (LPA1) or ATX inhibition decreased 
allograft fibrosis and was associated with lower active β-catenin and dephosphorylated NFAT1 expression. Lung allografts 
from β-catenin reporter mice demonstrated reduced β-catenin transcriptional activation in the presence of LPA1 antagonist, 
confirming an in vivo role for LPA signaling in β-catenin activation.

JCI88896DS1). Next, β-catenin expression in situ in BO lesions in 
human lung allografts was examined by immunohistochemical 
staining. β-Catenin expression was noted in the nuclei of MCs in 
fibrotic airways (Figure 1E). To determine whether β-catenin con￾tributes to the maintenance of a fibrotic phenotype in BOS MCs, 
we utilized β-catenin siRNA, and a decrease in collagen I protein 
expression was noted, suggesting that β-catenin is critical for the 
maintenance of fibrotic functions of BOS MCs (Figure 1F).
Autocrine ATX/LPA/LPA1 signaling axis contributes to β-caten￾in stabilization and collagen expression in BOS MCs. The free pool 
of β-catenin that is active in transcription is tightly regulated by 
its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation 
(20). Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) interacts with ade￾nomatous polyposis coli and axin proteins to form a destruction 
complex that phosphorylates β-catenin and makes it a target for 
proteasome-mediated degradation. We have previously shown 
that in human lung MCs, exogenous LPA via LPA1 ligation leads 
to GSK-3β phosphorylation, which inhibits β-catenin degradation 
and leads to β-catenin pathway activation (15). Comparison of 
BOS and non-BOS MCs demonstrated increased pGSK-3β expres￾sion in BOS cells; pGSK-3β phosphorylation was decreased when 
cells were transfected with LPA1 siRNA (Figure 2, A and B). More 
significantly, LPA1 silencing was found to robustly inhibit colla￾gen I and β-catenin protein expression in BOS MCs (Figure 2C), 
suggesting a role for endogenous LPA in regulating β-catenin sta￾sis in a murine lung transplant model of BO. Together, these studies 
uncover an interaction of NFAT1 and the β-catenin pathway, vali￾date LPA as an in vivo activator of β-catenin–dependent transcrip￾tion during allograft fibrogenesis, and suggest a potential therapeu￾tic role for LPA1 antagonists and ATX inhibition in BOS.
Results
β-Catenin stabilization in BOS MCs and its profibrotic functions.
We have previously demonstrated that MCs derived from fibrotic 
human lung allografts have an altered profibrotic phenotype, with 
increased expression of matrix proteins such as collagen I (4). To 
investigate whether β-catenin signaling is activated in MCs during 
allograft fibrogenesis, we first compared β-catenin protein expres￾sion in MCs isolated from lung allografts of patients with evidence 
of BOS (BOS MCs) and those isolated from BOS-free controls 
matched by time after lung transplant (non-BOS MCs). BOS MCs 
demonstrated significantly higher collagen I and β-catenin protein 
expression in the whole cell lysates as compared with non-BOS 
MCs (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively) (Figure 1, A and B). A 
significant positive correlation was noted between the total β-cat￾enin expression and collagen I expression of MCs (Figure 1C, P < 
0.0001; r2
 = 0.7310). β-Catenin expression was also higher in the 
nuclear fraction of BOS MCs compared with non-BOS cells (Figure 
1D). Immunocytochemistry of β-catenin confirmed upregulation 
and increased nuclear localization of β-catenin in BOS MCs com￾pared with non-BOS MCs (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental

lesions, where intense staining with ATX antibody was noted in MCs 
expressing α–smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Figure 3D).
Autocrine LPA synthesis and signaling are requisite for establish￾ing fibrotic lesions of BOS MCs after adoptive transfer.Adaptive trans￾fer experiments were performed to confirm the role of the ATX/
LPA/LPA1 axis in regulating fibrotic functions of human BOS MCs 
in vivo. DsRed lentivirus–labeled non-BOS and BOS MCs (0.5 × 
106) were injected intratracheally into the lungs of Beige/Nude/
XID triple-immunodeficient mice. Lungs were examined on day 
45 by immunofluorescence imaging and immunohistochemistry. 
As shown in Figure 4A, non-BOS MCs demonstrated engraft￾ment as single cells in alveolar corners, as previously described 
(23). However, BOS MCs demonstrated formation of cellular 
clusters and caused architectural distortion (Figure 4A), as has 
been demonstrated before with MCs derived from other fibrotic 
lung diseases (24). The interstitial localization of the cellular clus￾ters was established by confocal microscopy (Figure 4B). These 
fibrotic foci caused architectural distortion and were marked by 
collagen and α-SMA expression (Figure 4, C and D). To determine 
whether the ATX/LPA/LPA1 signaling pathway is important for 
BOS MCs to establish fibrotic lesions in an vivo environment, 
we infected DsRed-labeled human BOS MCs with lentiviruses 
expressing shRNA targeting LPA1 or ATX, or a control scram￾bled vector, pLKO.1, before intratracheal administration into 
bilization and fibrotic differentiation. As LPA is predominantly 
synthesized by actions of ATX (21, 22), LPA generation in MCs 
was targeted next by inhibiting expression of ATX. A substantial 
decrease in both β-catenin and collagen I protein expression was 
noted in BOS MCs transfected with ATX siRNA (Figure 2D). This 
ATX/LPA/LPA1/β-catenin signaling axis of MC activation was 
confirmed by studying the effect of exogenous recombinant ATX 
on non-BOS MCs. Recombinant ATX increased β-catenin protein 
expression in MCs from non-BOS lung allografts, and this response 
was blocked by LPA1 siRNA (Figure 2E). Additionally, induction 
of collagen I by recombinant ATX was noted to be dependent on 
LPA1 and β-catenin signaling, as demonstrated by the failure of 
ATX to induce an increase in collagen I in non-BOS MCs in the 
presence of LPA1 and β-catenin siRNA (Figure 2, F and G).
Next, we compared ATX expression and activity in BOS versus 
non-BOS MCs. ATX protein expression in whole cell lysates was not￾ed to be significantly higher in BOS MCs (Figure 3A). ATX was also 
quantitated by ELISA in MC supernatants. BOS MCs were found to 
secrete approximately 4-fold-higher levels of ATX than non-BOS 
MCs (Figure 3B). ATX activity was measured in the cell supernatant 
by utilizing a fluorogenic phospholipid ATX substrate, and increased 
ATX activity was confirmed in the supernatant from BOS as com￾pared with non-BOS MCs (Figure 3C). ATX expression in MCs in 
situ was studied by immunohistochemical staining of human BO

independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.

regulate ATX expression and its activity in MCs, we overexpressed 
constitutively active NFAT1 in non-BOS MCs. NFAT1 overexpres￾sion in non-BOS MCs was associated with a marked increase in 
ATX expression (Figure 5E). Total and active β-catenin and colla￾gen I were also induced by NFAT1 overexpression. ATX activity in 
non-BOS MCs, which was very low at baseline, was significantly 
increased in the presence of constitutively active NFAT1 (Figure 
5F). At the transcriptional level, a roughly 5-fold increase in ATX
and collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) mRNA was noted in 
non-BOS MCs with NFAT1 overexpression (Figure 5G). Expres￾sion of AXIN2, a β-catenin target gene, increased roughly 16-fold 
in NFAT1-overexpressing cells, demonstrating NFAT1 regulation 
of β-catenin transcription activity (Figure 5G).
Autocrine loop of NFAT1 and ATX regulation by LPA. LPA is 
known to increase intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i
), 
which has been linked to NFAT activation and nuclear translo￾cation (27–29). To investigate the possible involvement of LPA 
in mediating NFAT1 nuclear translocalization in lung MCs, 
murine lungs. Both LPA1 silencing and ATX silencing via shRNA 
approaches in BOS MCs prevented establishment of fibroprolifer￾ative human MC lesions in the recipient lung (Figure 4E). Quanti￾tative analysis, performed by counting cellular clusters (≥3 cells) 
of human MCs per high-power field in murine lung sections, con￾firmed these findings (Figure 4E).
Regulation of ATX by NFAT1 in lung MCs. Higher expression 
of ATX in BOS MCs led us to investigate the mechanisms regu￾lating ATX expression in these cells. Transcription of the ATX￾encoding gene ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiester￾ase 2 (ENPP2) has been shown to be under the control of transcrip￾tion factor NFAT1 (25, 26). BOS MCs were noted to demonstrate 
increased NFAT1 expression in whole cell and nuclear lysates (Fig￾ure 5, A and B). NFAT1 siRNA significantly inhibited ATX activity 
in cell supernatant from BOS MCs (Figure 5C). BOS MCs transfect￾ed with NFAT1 siRNA also demonstrated significantly decreased 
ATX protein expression as well as β-catenin and collagen I protein 
expression (Figure 5D). To further confirm the ability of NFAT1 to

expression at 15 minutes after LPA treatment (Figure 6B). LPA 
treatment of non-BOS MCs was also noted to induce an increase 
in ATX protein expression at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 6C). High￾er ATX activity was noted in the supernatant of MCs treated 
with LPA (Figure 6D). To determine whether LPA-induced ATX 
we transfected non-BOS MCs with a plasmid encoding a GFP￾NFAT1 fusion protein and treated them with LPA. Immunoflu￾orescence imaging demonstrated increased nuclear localization 
of GFP in the presence of LPA (Figure 6A). Immunoblot stud￾ies showed a roughly 6-fold increase in NFAT1 nuclear protein

expression occurs via an NFAT1-dependent mechanism, we 
measured ATX activity in the presence of LPA in cells transfect￾ed with scrambled or NFAT1 siRNA. ATX activity in LPA-treated 
cells was significant dampened by NFAT1 silencing (Figure 6E), 
suggesting that LPA regulates ATX via its induction of NFAT1 
activity. Next, to investigate whether endogenous LPA positive￾ly regulates ATX expression in an apparent feed-forward and 
autocrine manner in fibrotic MCs, the effect of interruption of 
LPA1 signaling on ATX expression was examined in BOS MCs. 
LPA1 silencing decreased ATX expression at both the protein and 
mRNA (P < 0.01) level in BOS MCs (Figure 6, F and G). NFAT1 
protein expression and NFAT1 mRNA levels were also decreased 
with LPA1 silencing (Figure 6, F and G). As expected, silencing of 
ATX did not affect LPA1 expression (Figure 6H).
Together these investigations of human lung allograft–derived 
MCs suggest an autocrine loop of MC activation, where ATX 
secretion and downstream LPA1 signaling act as an intermediary 
in tying NFAT1 to β-catenin activation. A schematic of the auto￾crine loop of NFAT1/ATX/LPA/LPA1/β-catenin signaling axis of 
MC activation suggested by these data and its proposed in vivo tar￾geting is presented in Figure 6I.

(30). To investigate the role of LPA1 signaling in allograft fibro￾genesis, we treated lung allograft recipients with the LPA1 antag￾onist AM095 or vehicle administered twice daily by oral gavage 
starting on day 14. A dose of 30 mg/kg was utilized, as it has been 
shown to attain mouse plasma AM095 concentrations that were 
consistently greater than the IC50 for LPA1 (16). Two treatment 
durations, from days 14 to 28 and days 14 to 40 after transplanta￾tion, were used, and all graft lungs were harvested on day 40 (Fig￾ure 7A). Attenuated allograft fibrosis was noted in AM095-treated 
allografts, with decreased peribronchial and perivascular collagen 
expression noted on trichrome staining (Figure 7B). The effect 
was found to be more pronounced in animals treated with AM095 
from days 14 to 40 as compared with those treated from days 14 to 
28 only. Airway wall thickness (VVsub), a morphometric quantita￾tive measure of airway remodeling, was noted to be significantly 
decreased in AM095-treated allografts with both durations (Fig￾ure 7C). Total collagen expression in the lungs was quantitated by

has been found to exhibit good oral availability (31); its long-term 
use had been demonstrated to have no toxic effects on mice (32). 
When administered orally at the dose of 30 mg/kg, PF-8380 has 
been shown to cause a greater than 95% reduction in LPA levels 
in both plasma and inflammatory tissue sites (31). Lung allografts 
(B6D2F1/J→DBA/2J) were treated with 30 mg/kg PF-8380, 
administered twice daily by oral gavage, from days 14 to 40 after 
transplantation (Figure 8A). Allografts were harvested, and plas￾ma was collected on day 40 after transplantation. The efficacy of 
this dose was confirmed by measuring plasma LPA levels by ELISA 
and studying ATX activity in lung homogenates. An approximately 
50% reduction in plasma LPA levels and significantly reduced ATX 
activity in allografts were noted in mice treated with PF-8380 (Sup￾plemental Figure 2). Histologic evaluation of the allografts treated 
presence and absence of AM095 by immunoblot analysis. Lower 
expression of total and active β-catenin protein pools, as well as 
decreased dephosphorylated NFAT1 and ATX protein expression, 
was noted in allografts treated with AM095 both for days 14–28 
and days 14–40, compared with placebo controls (Figure 7E).
ATX inhibition abates fibrogenesis in the orthotopic lung trans￾plant model. Next, we investigated whether an additional approach

transplants by 5 years after transplantation and is the major cause 
of long-term mortality in lung transplant recipients (36). Howev￾er, the mechanisms underlying fibrotic remodeling of the airways 
in the allograft are not well understood, and BOS represents an 
intractable terminal disease with few therapeutic options to pre￾vent its development or slow its progression. Here, we utilized 
MCs from human lung allografts and a murine orthotopic single 
lung transplantation model of BO to investigate mechanism(s) 
of lung allograft fibrogenesis and delineate a NFAT1/ATX/
LPA1/β-catenin signaling axis that regulates MC activation in an 
autocrine manner and contributes to lung allograft fibrogenesis 
(Figure 6I). Furthermore, our studies suggest a potential role for 
LPA1 antagonists and ATX inhibitors as therapeutic options in 
BOS and demonstrate the in vivo contribution of ATX/LPA1 sig￾naling to β-catenin activation.
Our studies and data identify an autocrine mechanism of 
fibrotic activation in lung MCs that contributes to allograft fibro￾genesis. Dysfunctional and persistent MC activation plays a 
key role in the progression of tissue fibrosis. β-Catenin has been 
demonstrated to be a key element in MC activation and fibrosis. 
The stably increased β-catenin expression noted in BOS MCs is 
consistent with previous studies of human MCs from other fibrot￾ic conditions (11). A unique finding was that interrupting LPA1
signaling or ATX expression in BOS MCs was sufficient to reverse 
their fibrotic state in vitro and abrogated their ability to estab￾lish fibrotic lesions after adaptive transfer in vivo. These findings 
demonstrate a previously unappreciated autocrine mechanism 
of cellular activation whereby MCs can regulate β-catenin and 
matrix expression via autocrine ATX secretion and downstream 
LPA1 signaling. Furthermore, the demonstration of a role for 
NFAT1 in induction of ATX and downstream β-catenin activation 
reveals links between these key regulatory pathways and provides 
insight into the self-perpetuating nature of fibrosis.
with PF-8380 demonstrated decreased airway remodeling, with 
lower peribronchial and perivascular collagen expression noted on 
trichrome staining (Figure 8B) and significantly decreased VVsub by 
morphometric analysis (Figure 8C). Hydroxyproline assay demon￾strated significantly lower collagen levels in the allografts treated 
with PF-8380 (Figure 8D). Consistent with our proposed signaling 
axis, lower expression of dephosphorylated NFAT1 and of total 
and active β-catenin protein was noted in allografts treated with 
PF-8380, compared with placebo-treated controls (Figure 8E).
Role of LPA signaling in β-catenin transcriptional activation 
in MC in vivo during murine allograft fibrogenesis. To study the in 
vivo role of LPA in transcriptional activation of β-catenin during 
allograft fibrogenesis, we utilized Axin2lacZ reporter mice, which 
carry a lacZ gene inserted into the Axin2 locus, as donors in the 
murine orthotopic lung transplant model (33, 34). The expression 
of lacZ through the endogenous Axin2 promoter faithfully reflects 
sites of β-catenin signaling, and the Axin2lacZ mouse has been 
previously validated as robust and specific to detect β-catenin 
signaling in the lungs (35). LacZ staining of allografts on day 40 
after transplantation demonstrated peribronchial lacZ expression 
consistent with fibrosis areas, as seen on consecutive trichrome 
staining slides (Figure 9). To investigate the in vivo role of LPA1 
signaling in driving β-catenin transcriptional activation in MCs 
during allograft fibrogenesis, we treated mice that had received 
Axin2lacZ donor allografts with LPA1 antagonist AM095 (30 mg/
kg by oral gavage). Reduced expression of LacZ in peribronchial 
fibrotic areas was noted in AM095-treated mice, suggesting that 
LPA1 signaling plays a significant role in vivo in β-catenin activa￾tion in MCs during allograft fibrosis (Figure 9).
Discussion
A decline in lung function arising from small airway fibrosis and 
obliteration or BOS develops in more than 50% of human lung 
Figure 9. LPA contributes to nuclear 
transcriptional activity of β-catenin in vivo 
during allograft fibrogenesis. Axin2lacZ mice 
were utilized as donors in the orthotopic lung 
transplant model. Transplanted mice were 
treated with AM095 or placebo during days 
14–40 after transplantation. β-Galactosidase, 
trichrome, and H&E staining was performed 
on isografts and placebo- and AM095-treat￾ed allografts harvested at day 40 (n = 2 for 
isograft, n = 3 for groups of placebo- and 
AM095-treated allografts). Images were 
taken with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope 
equipped with a Cool Snap EZ camera and 
NIS-Elements BR3.2 software. Strong (pur￾ple) β-galactosidase staining with Salmon￾gal was noted in bronchial subepithelial MCs 
in allografts. β-Galactosidase staining was 
markedly diminished in allografts treated 
with AM095. Scale bars: 30 μm.

vivo role of LPA1 ligation in β-catenin activation in MCs. In mice 
treated with the LPA1 antagonist AM095, a significant decrease 
in β-catenin transcriptional activation was noted, demonstrating a 
requisite role for LPA in β-catenin activation in this disease model.
We demonstrate that NFAT1 regulates ATX transcriptional 
expression in MCs and that increased ATX expression in fibrotic 
MCs is dependent on NFAT1 signaling. MCs from patients with 
BOS demonstrated an ATX-secretory function, as evidenced by 
increased ATX production as well as activity. This stable upregu￾lation of ATX in cells removed from their microenvironment has 
also been previously demonstrated in synovial cells from patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (45), as well as in human cancer cell lines 
(46). While ATX can be produced by a variety of cell types and 
ATX can be measured in biological fluids such as blood, it has been 
suggested that ATX expressed by cells can regulate their own local 
biological functions. The significance of ATX as a local regulator 
in the cellular niche has been strengthened by studies demonstrat￾ing that neutralization of circulating ATX is unable to affect local 
tissue processes (47). However, in spite of the recognition of the 
significant biological role of ATX, with its overexpression linked to 
disease pathogenesis, not much is known about regulators of ATX
expression. While ATX expression has been shown to be induced 
in the inflammatory state, this has been noted to be independent 
of lymphoid cytokines and TLR signaling (47). NFAT binding sites 
are found in the ATX promoter, and NFAT1 has been demonstrated 
to bind the ATX promoter in breast carcinoma cells (25). We found 
that NFAT1 overexpression in non-fibrotic MCs significantly upreg￾ulated ATX mRNA expression and increased ATX protein expres￾sion and activity. In BOS MCs, where ATX was upregulated at base￾line, NFAT1 silencing strongly decreased ATX expression as well as 
protein activity. Calcium signaling has been shown to be dysregu￾lated in fibrotic cells (48), consistent with our finding in BOS MCs, 
where increased NFAT1 total and nuclear protein expression was 
noted. LPA as a regulator of calcium signaling was associated with 
NFAT1 nuclear translocation, suggesting a positive feedback that 
can continue to sustain this dysregulated activation cycle.
In summary, we identity a mechanism of regulation of β-cat￾enin activation in MCs via autocrine ATX secretion. NFAT1 was 
identified as a key transcriptional regulator of ATX, and these 
studies are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate a link 
between the two key transcriptional regulators, NFAT1 and β-cat￾enin. Additionally, we believe that this is the first investigation 
to demonstrate a role for LPA1 signaling in the pathogenesis of 
lung allograft fibrosis. The lack of effective therapies to stop BOS 
progression and the significant effect of AM095 and PF-8380 in 
the murine model of BO suggest that LPA1 antagonists and ATX 
inhibitors might prove to be an effective therapeutic intervention.
Methods
Cell isolation and culture conditions. Bronchoalveolar lavage from lung 
transplant recipients with and without evidence of BOS was utilized 
for MC isolation. BOS was identified based on criteria defined by Inter￾national Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines and 
as previously described (3). Non-BOS MCs were obtained from lung 
transplant recipients who were BOS-free and had no evidence of acute 
rejection or infection with transbronchial biopsies and microbiological 
cultures, respectively. MCs were isolated and characterized as previous￾The role of the ATX/LPA pathway in BOS has not been pre￾viously recognized, and we believe these are the first studies to 
investigate this signaling pathway in lung allograft fibrogenesis. 
In the murine lung transplant model of BO, LPA1 antagonism and 
ATX inhibition were noted to be protective and associated with a 
significant decrease in allograft fibrosis, as demonstrated by his￾tology and quantitative analysis of tissue collagen. This finding 
is of potentially significant clinical relevance, as orally available 
selective LPA1 antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in other 
murine models of tissue fibrosis (16, 37) and are in clinical trials 
in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Development of 
ATX inhibitors for clinical use has also received significant inter￾est, and these compounds are being evaluated in preclinical stud￾ies (38–41). We utilize a murine lung transplant model of BO in 
the preclinical investigation of AM095 and PF-8380. The drugs 
were dosed starting on day 14, a time point beyond the initial 
ischemia-reperfusion phase and well into the alloimmune injury 
phase. In this model, in which development of BO is highly pen￾etrant and reproducible, fibrosis is well established on day 28 and 
progresses further by day 40 (30). Statistically significant differ￾ences were noted on day 40 between AM095- or PF-8380–treated 
and placebo-treated animals, demonstrating that both drugs pre￾vented the development and progression of fibrosis. Interesting￾ly, treatment with AM095 for 14 days (from days 14 to 28) seems 
to have a residual inhibitory effect in lung allograft fibrosis when 
examined on day 40. However, comparison of the two groups 
with different treatment durations (days 14–28 and days 14–40) 
demonstrated that continued LPA1 antagonism leads to a much 
more robust decrement in allograft fibrogenesis. While pharma￾cologic inhibition of LPA1 or ATX in a murine model does not 
provide a cell type–specific approach in targeting MCs, our data 
demonstrate a role for inhibition of the ATX/LPA/LPA1 axis in 
targeting chronic allograft rejection and underscore the potential 
importance of this approach for future human therapeutic trials.
The present study provides what we believe to be the first in 
vivo evidence for the role of LPA in regulating β-catenin signaling. 
Lung allografts from Axin2lacZ reporter mice were utilized to elu￾cidate the requisite role for LPA in β-catenin transcriptional acti￾vation in vivo during allograft fibrogenesis. While β-catenin acti￾vation has long been recognized as the major effector of the Wnt 
signaling pathway, recent studies have suggested a role for GPCRs 
in activation of the β-catenin pathway (13, 14). LPA as a ligand for 
β-catenin activation was first noted in colon cancer cells, where 
β-catenin was demonstrated to be important for mediating cellu￾lar proliferation in the presence of LPA. The increase in β-catenin 
was shown to be dependent on LPA2 and LPA3 receptors in these 
cells (42). Subsequently, while investigating MC migration in lung 
allografts, we discovered that β-catenin is activated in MCs in the 
presence of LPA and is essential for LPA-induced migration in 
vitro (15). β-Catenin activation in lung MCs was found to be reg￾ulated via LPA1-dependent GSK-3β phosphorylation. Others have 
since reiterated the role for LPA in promoting β-catenin stabili￾zation and transcriptional activation (43, 44). However, all these 
investigations have been performed in vitro, and whether LPA tru￾ly acts as a ligand in vivo had not been established. Lung allografts 
from reporter mice (Axin2lacZ) allowed us to follow β-catenin tran￾scriptional activity during allograft fibrogenesis and test the in

Immunohistochemical staining of human BO lesions. Immunohisto￾chemistry staining was performed on human lung BO lesions in autopsy 
samples according to standard clinical laboratory procedures. Primary 
antibodies for β-catenin (ab6302, Abcam, 1:1,000), ATX (H-008-29, 
Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, 1:1,000), and α-SMA (ab124964, Abcam, 
1:500) were used in this study. Imaging was performed with an Olym￾pus BX41 microscope connected to an Olympus DP20 camera.
ATX ELISA and ATX activity assay. BOS and Non-BOS cell lines 
were cultured in 60-mm dishes until confluent. Cells were washed 
once with PBS and then serum starved for 24 hours. Serum-free super￾natant was collected, and ATX levels were measured with a Human 
ENPP-2/Autotaxin Quantikine ELISA Kit (DENP20, R&D Systems) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance at 450 nm 
was measured using a SpectraMax M3 multi-mode microplate reader 
(Molecular Devices). For ATX activity, cell supernatant was collected, 
centrifuged at 17,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to sediment floating cells 
or debris, and concentrated to one-eighth of the original volume with 
an Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-3 membrane 
(UFC800308, EMD Millipore). After measurement of protein concen￾tration, an equal amount of total protein was subjected to ATX activity 
assay with the fluorogenic phospholipid ATX substrate FS-3 (L-2000, 
Echelon) (49, 50). Briefly, 30 μl supernatant and 40 μl FS-3 solution 
(containing 5 μM FS-3, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2
, 1 mM 
MgCl2
, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 1 mg/ml BSA) were mixed and 
loaded to a Costar 96-well black-wall, clear-bottom plate. Fluores￾cence of samples was measured using a SpectraMax M3 multi-mode 
microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission 
wavelengths of 485 nm and 528 nm, respectively.
For ATX activity assays in lung lysates, 20 μl allograft lysate and 
40 μl FS-3 solution were mixed, and ATX activity was measured simi￾larly for placebo- and PF-8380–treated lung allografts.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR.Total RNA was isolated using the 
RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, QIAGEN), and cDNA was synthesized with 
the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (4368814, Applied 
Biosystems). Real-time PCR for ATX, Axin2, NFAT1, LPA1, and β-ac￾tin was conducted with probes Hs00905125_m1, Hs_00610344_m1, 
Hs00905451_m1, Hs_00173500_m1, and 4310881E (Applied Bio￾systems), respectively, and TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix 
(4369016, Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR for COL1A1 tran￾scripts was conducted in SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (4309155, 
Applied Biosystems) and with the following primers: COL1A1F, GTG￾CGATGACGTGATCTGTGA and COL1A1R, CGGTGGTTTCTTG￾GTCGGT. The relative mRNA levels of the target genes were calcu￾lated as equal to 2−(ΔCt target mRNA – ΔCt β-actin).
GFP-NFAT1 subcellular localization by live cell imaging. Plasmid for 
expressing GFP-NFAT1 fusion protein was provided by Jaime Modi￾ano of the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA 
(51). Non-BOS MCs were transfected with GFP-NFAT1–expressing 
plasmid using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (94756, Invitrogen) and 
Plus reagent (10964-021, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Stable clones of cells expressing GFP-NFAT1 were select￾ed in complete DMEM supplemented with 150 μg ml−1 G418 sulfate 
(10131-035, Gibco) and maintained in 100 μg ml−1 G418-containing 
medium. GFP-NFAT1 localization and nucleus staining by Hoechst 
33342 (62249, Thermo Scientific) in live cells were examined using a 
Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope equipped with a Cool Snap HQ2
camera operated with the Metamorph program.
ly described (2). Briefly, cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
by centrifugation (200 g for 5 minutes) were maintained in adherent 
culture conditions, and MCs were identified by their growth as fibro￾blastoid colony-forming units. Cells were passaged by trypsinization 
and maintained in culture in high-glucose DMEM (11965118, Gibco, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS (F2442, Sigma-Aldrich), 100 
U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (15140122, Gibco), and 0.5% Fungizone 
(15290018, Gibco) at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2
. Cells 
between passages 3 and 6 were used for experiments. The mesenchy￾mal phenotype and purity of the cells were confirmed by staining for 
cell surface markers by flow cytometry. MCs demonstrated uniform 
expression of CD44, CD73, CD105, and CD90 and lacked expression 
of CD45, CD31, and EPCAM (Supplemental Figure 3). Reagents used 
for cell treatment included 1-oleoyl LPA (62215, Cayman Chemical) and 
human recombinant ATX (10803, Cayman Chemical). Before reagent 
treatments, cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours till 
they grew to approximately 70% confluence.
Immunoblot analysis. Whole cell lysates or nuclear fractions of 
MCs were extracted as previously reported (15). Mouse lung allografts 
with AM095 or placebo control treatment were homogenized with 
a Tissuemiser (15-338-420, Fisher Scientific) in CelLytic MT Cell 
Lysis Reagent (C3228, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with Protease 
Inhibitor Cocktail (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich) and Halt Phosphatase 
Inhibitor Cocktail (78426, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then allograft 
homogenate was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 15 minutes and 17,000 
g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were collected, and protein 
concentration was determined with a Pierce Coomassie Plus (Brad￾ford) Assay Kit (23236, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Thermo 
Scientific BioMate 3 Spectrophotometer. Western blotting was per￾formed to analyze protein expression levels using primary antibod￾ies against LPA1 (ab23698, Abcam, 1:200), human-specific NFAT1 
(MAB6499, R&D Systems, 1:1,000), NFAT1 (MA1-025, Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, 1:1,000), ATX (10005375, Cayman Chemical, 
1:100), β-catenin (ab6302, Abcam, 1:2,000), active β-catenin (05-
665, Millipore, 1:1,000), phospho–GSK-3β (ab75814, Abcam, 1:500), 
collagen I (CL50111AP-1, Cedarlane, 1:500), GAPDH (MAB374, Mil￾lipore, 1:5,000), and SAM68 (sc-333, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., 
1:1,000). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary anti￾bodies were A8924 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:20,000) and A0545 (Sigma￾Aldrich, 1:10,000), respectively.
Gene silencing. For siRNA, MCs were transiently transfected at 
60%–70% confluence with 100 nM siRNA targeting β-catenin (42816, 
Ambion), NFAT1 (M-003606-02-0005, Dharmacon), LPA1 (4050, 
Ambion), ATX (M-004601-02-0005, Dharmacon), and nontarget￾ing scrambled siRNA (sc-37007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) using 
Oligofectamine (12252-011, Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I reduced serum 
medium overnight. Then MCs were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 
another 48 hours before any additional treatment or 72 hours before 
harvesting of cells for protein or RNA isolation. To silence ATX and LPA1 
by shRNA, respectively, for adoptive transfer, DsRed-labeled MCs were 
infected with MISSION Lentiviral Transduction Particles (SHCLNV, 
Sigma-Aldrich) containing either a shRNA targeting ATX or LPA1 or with 
control silencing vector pLKO.1. The sequences of ATX or LPA1 shRNA 
constructs within the pLKO.1 vector were 5′-CCGGGCTCCTAATAAT￾GGGACCCATCTCGAGATGGGTCCCATTATTAGGAGCTTTTTG-3′
and 5′-GGTTGCAATCGAGAGGCACATTACTCGAGTAATGTGCC￾TCTCGATTGCAATTTTTG-3′, respectively.

a previously described technique (30). Male mice aged 8–12 weeks 
and weighing 24–30 g were used as donors or recipients. Isografts 
were performed in the B6D2F1/J lungs→B6D2F1/J strain combina￾tions, and allogeneic transplants were performed in the B6D2F1/J 
lungs→DBA/2J strain combinations. A surgical microscope (SZX16-
SZX2; Olympus) with ×2.1 to ×34.5 magnifications was used for all 
procedures. Buprenorphine was given to recipient mice at the con￾clusion of the procedure and again every 12 hours until 3 days after 
transplant. Morphometric analysis and hydroxyproline quantification 
were performed as described previously (30). For β-catenin transcrip￾tional activity assays, Axin2lacZ mice of B6D2F1/J was generated by 
crossing C57BL/6 Axin2lacZ (B6.129P2-Axin2tm1Wbm/J, stock 009120, 
The Jackson Laboratory) females with DBA/2J males. For β-galacto￾sidase staining, sections were incubated in staining solution: 1 mg/
ml Salmon-gal (6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) (X668, 
Lab Scientific) and 0.4 mM NBT (4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride) 
(11383213001, Roche) in PBS at 37°C for 3 hours (52).
Oral gavage. Oral gavage was performed in a containment room 
of the University of Michigan animal facility. PF-8380 (HY-13344, 
MedChem Express) and AM095 were dissolved in PEG 400 at a con￾centration of 6 mg/ml. Body weights of animals were measured daily. 
Treatment with PF-8380 or AM095 was administered by oral gavage 
twice daily at a dosage of 30 mg/kg body weight starting from day 14 
after lung transplantation. Placebo-treated mice were given vehicle 
(PEG 400) via oral gavage ingestion. On day 40 after lung transplan￾tation, mice were sacrificed, and lung allografts were harvested for 
Western blotting, hydroxyproline assay, or immunohistochemistry.
Statistics. Statistical significance was analyzed using Graph￾Pad Prism 6 Software. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM
