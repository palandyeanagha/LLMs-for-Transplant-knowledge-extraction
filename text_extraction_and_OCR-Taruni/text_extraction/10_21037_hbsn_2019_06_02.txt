Background: Previous research has demonstrated that specific radiographic criteria, including the 
presence of calcifications and the enhancement pattern on computed tomography (CT) imaging, correlates 
with clinicopathologic features and outcomes of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 
(NET). We sought to investigate whether these radiographic characteristics were prognostic among patients 
with neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM) undergoing surgical resection.
Methods: The preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans of all patients who underwent resection of NELM 
at a single institution between 2000–2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of calcifications was 
determined on non-contrast phase imaging. Enhancement on the arterial phase scan was categorized as 
hyperenhancing, hypoenhancing, or mixed. Relevant clinicopathologic characteristics as well as recurrence￾free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups.
Results: Among 82 patients who underwent resection of NELM, 57 had available data on calcifications 
while 51 had data available on arterial enhancement patterns. Among all patients, median age was 58 (IQR: 
47–63) and the majority were female (N=48, 59.5%). The most common primary tumor locations were 
pancreas (N=25, 30.5%) and small bowel (N=27, 32.9%). The most commonly performed operations were 
right hepatectomy (N=29, 35.4%), bisegmentectomy (N=15, 18.3%), and segmentectomy (N=14, 17.1%). 
Median tumor number was 4 (IQR: 2–9), median Ki-67 was 5% (IQR: 2–10%), and median size of the 
largest liver metastasis was 4.5 (IQR: 2.8–7.7) cm. Twelve (21%) patients had tumor calcifications. Among 
patients with and without calcifications there were no differences in demographics, clinicopathologic 
characteristics, RFS (P=0.772) or OS (P=0.095). Arterial enhancement was hypoenhancing in 23 (45.1%), 
hyperenhancing in 10 (19.6%), and mixed in 18 (35.3%). Similarly, there were no differences between 
arterial enhancement groups in demographics, clinicopathologic characteristics, RFS (P=0.618) or OS 
(P=0.268).
Conclusions: Radiographic characteristics on contrast-enhanced CT are not associated with the outcomes 
of patients undergoing resection of NELM. Future investigations should evaluate the prognostic impact of 
functional neuroendocrine imaging.

Introduction
Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a rare and heterogenous 
group of neoplasia that develop from enterochromaffin cells 
of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and pancreas. The nature 
of these tumors ranges from a slow-growing phenotype to 
aggressive, rapidly growing neoplasms. Well-differentiated 
NETs typically exhibit an indolent disease presentation 
and overall survival (OS) rates for patients with localized 
disease at 5 years range between 43% and 93%, depending 
on the primary tumor site (1). Liver metastases from well￾differentiated NETs occur frequently and are associated 
with a worse prognosis, with a 5-year OS rate between 13% 
and 54% (2-4). Fortunately, multiple treatment options 
for neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM) are available, 
including ablation, transarterial therapies, peptide receptor 
radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and systemic chemotherapy 
(5-8). Currently, the only potentially curative treatment for 
NELM is surgical resection, however, the lack of reliable 
biomarkers or prognostic factors limits the ability to 
appropriately select patients who are likely to benefit from 
surgical treatment (9-13).
Previous research has demonstrated that specific 
radiographic criteria on computed tomography (CT) imaging 
correlates with the clinicopathologic features and outcomes 
of patients with gastroenteropancreatic NETs undergoing 
surgical resection. For example, hypoenhancement of 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) was associated 
with larger size, intermediate grade, and higher rates of 
lymph node and synchronous liver metastases as well as 
worse OS following resection compared to patients with 
hyperenhancing PNETs (14). In another study, the presence 
of calcifications on preoperative CT correlated with 
intermediate tumor grade and the presence of lymph node 
metastasis, which predicted poor patient outcome (15). 
Nevertheless, whether similar radiographic criteria are 
associated with the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing 
resection of NELM has not been previously investigated. 
Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if 
NELM enhancement pattern and/or the presence of 
tumor calcifications correlates with other clinicopathologic 
characteristics or long-term survival after hepatic resection.
Methods
A retrospective review of all patients with NELM who 
underwent resection between 2000 and 2015 at the Ohio 
State University Wexner Medical Center and James Cancer 
Hospital and Solove Research Institute were included. 
Patients who did not have preoperative multi-phase CT 
scans were excluded. This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the Ohio State University.
Individual patient data were then abstracted from the 
electronic medical record. The following patient variables 
were considered: age, gender, race, health insurance status, 
American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, Charlson 
comorbidity score, patient comorbidities including diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and body mass index. The following characteristics 
of the primary tumor were considered: location of the 
primary, whether the tumor was functional, patient 
symptom status, tumor size, grade, Ki-67 and whether liver 
metastases were synchronous. Characteristics of the liver 
metastases were also considered including tumor Hounsfeld 
units (HU) on CT in the arterial phase, calcification status 
on non-contrast CT, type of operation, size of largest 
metastasis, number of metastases, tumor grade and Ki-67.
All patients underwent multi-phase CT with thin￾axial sections of the abdomen and pelvis with dedicated 
non-contrast, arterial, portal venous, and delayed phasing 
imaging prior to surgical resection. For the purposes of this 
study, all preoperative CT were re-reviewed using Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM, 
Arlington, VA, USA). Tumor attenuation (Figure 1) was 
measured by placing an oval region of interest (ROI) of 
10 mm2
 within the tumor. Care was taken to avoid areas of 
calcifications, treatment effect (if applicable), or adjacent 
normal vasculature when assessing tumor enhancement. 
This was performed three times for each representative 
liver mass, and the mean of these measurements was used 
to represent the average tumor attenuation. When multiple 
tumors were present in one patient, the characteristics of 
the largest tumor were recorded. Normal liver parenchyma 
attenuation similarly was defined as the average of three 
10 mm2
 oval ROI within the liver parenchyma. The 
degree of tumor enhancement on arterial phase imaging 
was determined by comparison of the average tumor 
attenuation to the average surrounding hepatic parenchyma 
attenuation. Enhancement was categorized as hypo-, hyper￾or mixed enhancement based on this comparison. Mixed 
enhancement was defined as a mass exhibiting multiple 
areas of both hyper- and hypoenhancement compared to 
the surrounding liver parenchyma. In addition, the presence 
of calcifications was also assessed by evaluating non-contrast 
phase imaging (Figure 1). For patients with multiple tumors,

the presence of calcifications in any lesion was included.
The method of hepatic resection was deferred to the 
individual surgeon. Following surgery, all patients were 
followed in a multidisciplinary fashion by surgical and 
medical oncology. Surveillance imaging with CT chest/
abdomen/pelvis and tumor markers were obtained every 
6 months. Recurrence was defined as radiographic evidence 
of recurrent tumor after a complete (R0 or R1) resection; 
confirmatory biopsies were not required. Recurrence free 
survival was defined as the time of resection to the time of 
recurrence or last follow-up in months. OS was defined as 
the time of resection to the time of death or last follow-up 
in months.
First, the clinicopathologic characteristics, operative 
details, and long-term outcomes of patients with NELM 
that did and did not contain calcifications were compared. 
Second, the clinicopathologic characteristics, operative 
details, and long-term outcomes of patients with NELM 
who demonstrated hyperenhancement, hypoenhancement, 
or mixed enhancement were compared. Categorical 
variables were compared using chi-square tests or Fisher’s 
exact tests, as appropriate. Continuous variables were 
compared using Students t-test or Kruskal-Wallis one-way 
analysis of variance, as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and log-rank tests were used to compare recurrence￾free survival (RFS) and OS among calcification and 
arterial enhancement groups. Additionally, supplementary 
univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to analyze 
the association of clinicopathologic characteristics and 
operative details with OS among the entire cohort. All 
analysis was performed in STATA MP 14.2 (StataCorp, 
College Station, TX, USA). Statistical significance was 
assessed at 0.05.
Results
Eighty-two patients with NELM met inclusion criteria. 
Complete demographic, clinicopathologic, and operative 
data for the entire cohort are reported in Table 1. Most 
patients had pancreatic (N=25, 30.5%) or small bowel 
(N=27, 32.9%) primaries, with the majority grade 1 (N=38, 
69.1%), having a median Ki-67 of 3% (IQR: 2–10%). Prior 
treatment history was heterogeneous: 69 patients (84.1%) 
had received prior systemic chemotherapy, 70 (85.3%) had 
received prior somatostatin analogs, and 23 (28.0%) had 
undergone prior transarterial chemoembolization. Twelve 
(21.1%) patients had calcifications in their NELM. Arterial 
enhancement status was hypoenhancing (N=23, 45.1%), 
hyperenhancing (N=10, 19.6%) and mixed (N=18, 35.3%). 
The most commonly performed operations were right 
hepatectomy (N=29, 35.4%), bisegmentectomy (N=15, 
18.3%), and anatomic segmentectomy (N=14, 17.1). The 
median largest tumor size was 4.5 (IQR: 2.8–7.7) cm and 
the median tumor number was 4 (IQR: 2–9). Median 
follow-up after first liver resection in the entire patient 
cohort was 42 (IQR: 30–79) months. RFS in the entire 
cohort was 34.5 (IQR: 23–57) months after first liver 
resection, while median OS after first liver resection was 
44 (IQR: 31–80) months. Factors significantly associated 
with OS on univariate Cox regression analysis among the 
entire cohort included BMI (HR, 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.96, 
P=0.009) and differentiation of the liver metastasis (HR, 
5.67, 95% CI: 1.97, 16.26, P=0.001), whereas Ki67 (HR, 
2.62, 95% CI: 0.99, 6.97, P=0.053) did not quite reach 
statistical significance (Table S1).
Tumor calcification
Fifty-seven patients (69.5%) had noncontrast CT images 
which could be analyzed for presence of calcifications. 
The clinicopathological and demographic characteristics 
of this cohort are reported in Table 2 and, in general, were 
similar to the overall cohort. Of this group, 12 (21.1%) 
had calcifications associated with their NELM. Compared 
to patients without calcifications, patient demographics, 
including age, gender, race, and insurance status, were not 
significantly different in the calcification patient group (all 
P>0.05) although there were some differences in ASA class, 
ECOG performance status, and comorbidities (Table 2).
On univariate analysis, primary tumor location, 
functionality, size, grade, Ki-67%, and presence of 
synchronous liver metastases were not associated with 
development of liver tumor calcification (P>0.05). 
Furthermore, calcifications were not significantly associated 
with the size of the largest metastasis, number of liver 
metastases, tumor grade, Ki-67%, or tumor enhancement 
patterns demonstrated on CT A/P (P>0.05). Median RFS 
after first liver resection was 32 (IQR: 16–49) months in the 
group without calcifications and 34 (IQR: 32–45) months 
in the group with calcifications. Median OS after first liver 
resection was 41 (IQR: 30–70) months in the group without 
calcifications and 66 (IQR: 30–113) months in the group 
with calcifications. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 
there was no difference in RFS (Figure 2A, P=0.772) or OS 
(Figure 2B, P=0.095) between patients with NELM with 
and without calcifications.

Tumor arterial enhancement pattern
Fifty-one (of 82, 62.2%) patients had triple phase CT A/
P performed. The clinicopathological and demographic 
characteristics of this cohort are reported in Table 3
and, in general, were similar to the overall cohort. Of 
these 51 patients, most had NELM demonstrating 
hypoenhancement (N=23, 45.1%), followed by mixed 
enhancement (N=18, 35.3%), and hyperenhancement 
(N=10, 19.6%) patterns. Patients who had hypoenhancing, 
hyperenhancing, and mixed enhancement tumors had a 
median arterial attenuation of 45.4 (IQR: 32.7–56.1) HU, 
87.2 (IQR: 78.5–109.8) HU, and 67.5 (IQR: 57.8–76.8) 
HU, respectively. Venous phase tumor enhancement for 
hypoenhancing, hyperenhancing, and mixed enhancement 
tumors were found to be 64.0 (IQR: 50.0–77.9) HU, 91.6 
(IQR: 78.7–107.8) HU, and 83.5 (IQR: 66.5–99.0) HU,

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of 
radiographic features on the preoperative CT imaging of 
patients with NELM undergoing surgical resection. Our 
study had several interesting findings. First, enhancement 
patterns were quite variable with hypoenhancement 
representing the most common pattern (45.1%), followed 
by mixed-enhancement (35.3%) and hyperenhancement 
(19.6%). Second, tumor calcifications were relatively 
common with 21.0% of patients demonstrating some 
degree of tumor calcification. Third, neither radiographic 
characteristic correlated with the outcomes of patients 
undergoing resection of NELM. These findings suggest 
that traditional clinicopathologic criteria (e.g., Ki-67 rate, 
disease free interval, number of tumors) should be used to 
guide treatment decision making until novel biomarkers 
are identified that improve patient selection for hepatic 
resection.
To date, there have been very few studies characterizing 
NELM CT features. One study of 78 patients with 
559 NELMs characterized the enhancement patterns 
demonstrated by triple-phase CT of NELM of pancreatic 
primary origin (pNELM) to those of enteric primary 
origin (eNELM). Their findings demonstrated that a 
majority of both pNELM and eNELM demonstrated 
arterial hyperenhancement (including tumors which 
demonstrated heterogenous enhancement but were 
predominantly hyperenhancing), indicating that these 
tumors were hypervascular (16). Another study indicated 
that hepatic metastases from gastric NET were more 
likely to show hyperenhancing patterns than hepatic 
metastases from gastric adenocarcinomas (17). While our 
study also demonstrated that a majority of the analyzed 
tumors demonstrated some degree of hypervascularity with 
54.8% of tumors demonstrating purely hyperenhancing 
or partially hyperenhancing features, their results 
indicated that 72% of NELM showed heterogeneous 
contrast enhancement patterns. This is in contrast to the 
35.2% mixed enhancement pattern in the current study. 
Additionally, the study indicated that pNELM could 
potentially be differentiated from eNELM through analysis 
of non-contrast and portal venous phases of CT A/P, with 
pNELM more likely demonstrating hyperenhancement on 
contrast imaging and eNELM more likely demonstrating 
hypoenhancement on portal venous phase (16). This 
knowledge could potentially be very useful in cases where 
the location of the primary tumor is unknown, which is the 
case in up to 13% of all NET (1,18).
While these previous studies were important for 
characterizing the enhancement patterns of various 
NELM, our study is one of the first to study its prognostic 
importance. While the enhancement pattern does not 
appear to correlate with post-resection outcomes, these 
features are important outside the scope of surgical 
treatment. Hypervascular NELM demonstrating a 
hyperenhancing pattern on CT arterial phase is significantly 
more amenable to liver-directed transarterial therapy than 
hypoenhancing lesions (19,20).
The importance of calcifications in NELM has been 
even less discussed in the current literature. With respect 
to primary NETs, the presence of calcifications in PNETs

has been shown to correlate with intermediate grade 
and presence of lymph node metastases (15). Although 
the frequency of PNET calcifications is uncommon, the 
presence of focal, centrally-located, coarse calcifications 
on CT can potentially differentiate PNET from other 
types of pancreatic tumors which typically show different 
calcification patterns (21). Ours is the first study to 
investigate the potential importance of tumor calcifications 
on NELMs, finding no association with long-term 
outcomes of patients undergoing resection. It is possible 
that the biological importance of calcifications becomes less 
significant when metastases have developed, as compared to 
in the primary tumor.
Radiomics is an increasingly important field in clinical and 
translational medicine. Radiographic tumor markers have 
demonstrated importance in predicting patient prognosis and 
response to therapy. One study by Kim et al. concluded that 
pNETs demonstrating uncommon CT findings, including 
poorly defined borders, heterogeneous enhancement, 
hypovascularity, and duct dilation correlated with higher 
tumor grade and poorer survival rates compared to PNETs 
that did not demonstrate these characteristics (22). Another 
study suggested radiographic characteristics may be most 
useful in combination with clinical data in predicting PNET 
characteristics, such as tumor grade (23). While the results 
of this study were negative, improvements in functional 
imaging raise possibilities for novel predictive markers 
which may not only predict patient prognosis but may also 
aid in surgical planning (24-26).
There are several limitations to our study, namely the 
single-institution, retrospective design and relatively small 
sample size. Several patients in this study received prior 
therapy and the impact of such therapy on the radiographic 
characteristics of NELM is unknown. In addition, given 
the retrospective nature of the study, differences in imaging 
methodology were possible. For example, factors such as 
pre-enhancement set point, which has been shown to have 
subjectivity in observer variation, can affect CT perfusion, 
leading to variability in determining tumor vascularity (27). 
On the other hand, radiographic protocols for patients with 
NETs undergoing CT at our institution are standardized, 
which should have minimized these biases. Furthermore, 
all the patients analyzed in our study underwent hepatic 
resection, so there was significant degree of selection bias 
within the analyzed patient population. In general, patients 
who undergo hepatic resection for NELM often have better 
prognoses than patients who are not surgical candidates 
(3,28,29). While the goal of this study was to primarily 
investigate the relationship of CT imaging characteristics 
and post-surgical resection outcomes, future studies could 
include non-surgical NELM patients to determine the 
relationship between CT characteristics with prognostic 
factors such as tumor grade as well as long-term survival. 
Given the relatively small sample size, future investigations 
may be best performed in a multi-institutional fashion.
Conclusions
In conclusion, radiographic characteristics on contrast￾enhanced CT, specifically arterial enhancement pattern 
and presence of calcifications, are not associated with the 
outcomes of patients undergoing resection of NELM. 
Future investigations should evaluate the prognostic impact 
of functional neuroendocrine imaging among a broader 
patient population.
