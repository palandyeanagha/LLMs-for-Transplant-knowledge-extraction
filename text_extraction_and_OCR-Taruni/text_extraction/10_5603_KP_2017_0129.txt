Intermission
Dear Readers, Authors and Reviewers,
Thank you for your interest in Kardiologia Polska (Polish Heart
Journal). Kardiologia Polska changes the publisher since May 2021.
Due to the necessity to transfer the journal’s archive to the website
managed by the new publisher — Via Medica, technical problems
may occur for a few days. Due to the ongoing reconstruction of the
website, readers who want to read full articles should go to the
Archive tab and find the issue in a given year.


We apologize for any temporary inconvenience.
We apologize for the temporary problems.
