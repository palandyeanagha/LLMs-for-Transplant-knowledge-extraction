ABSTRACT
Major and extended hepatic resections are being performed with increasing
frequency as morbidity and mortality rates after major hepatectomies have declined and
definitions of resectability have expanded for primary and metastatic hepatic malignancies.
Systematic assessment of the anticipated functional remnant liver is essential before major
hepatic resection to avoid postoperative hepatic insufficiency and its attendant sequelae. The
volume of the future liver remnant (FLR) correlates with FLR function and postoperative
outcome. This article describes the rationale for FLR measurement, methods of measuring
FLR volume, and standardization to the total estimated liver volume. The indications for
portal vein embolization based on standardized liver volumetry are summarized.
KEYWORDS: Liver volumetry, future liver remnant, portal vein embolization

Complete surgical resection of primary and
metastatic hepatic malignancies provides patients the
best chance of long-term survival. With improvements
in anesthetic monitoring, surgical techniques, and peri￾operative critical care, major and extended hepatic re￾sections are being increasingly performed with low
morbidity and mortality rates.1,2 This trend toward an
aggressive surgical management results partly from an
expansion of the traditional selection criteria for hepatic
resection to include patients once deemed unresectable,
such as those with large and multiple tumors. Indeed,
the definition of resectability has recently changed from
one based on tumor characteristics, such as tumor
number and size, to one based on whether the disease
can be completely resected with negative margins. This
paradigm shift implies that surgeons should focus on
what will remain after resection, the future liver remnant
(FLR), rather than concentrating on what is removed.
These changes in criteria for resectability were formal￾ized in a consensus conference on colorectal metastases

hepatocellular carcinoma.4
The objectives of this article are to review data
supporting the need for meticulous FLR evaluation
before hepatic resection and to discuss methodologies
for FLR assessment. We advocate a standardized trans￾latable approach to measuring FLR based on the asso￾ciation between liver and patient size.
RATIONALE FOR FUTURE LIVER REMNANT
MEASUREMENT
Major or extended hepatectomy can be performed with
near-to-zero mortality rates in patients without cirrho￾sis,5 yet significant morbidity, particularly postoperative
hepatic insufficiency, remains a major concern.6–9 In a
recent series of 1059 major hepatectomies performed in
noncirrhotic patients, including 390 extended hepatec￾tomies, Mullen et al8 reported that hepatic insufficiency
complicated the postoperative course after 8% of the
procedures. In such circumstances, patients often require
prolonged intensive care unit stays, endure a protracted
recovery, and can ultimately succumb to fatal hepatic
failure. In the study by Mullen et al, the hepatic
insufficiency-related mortality rate was 2.8%.8
Although the risk of postoperative hepatic insuf￾ficiency is influenced by multiple factors, a key determi￾nant to ensuring adequate functional remnant liver is
preoperative measurement of the FLR volume.10–13
Therefore, preoperative volumetric analysis of the an￾ticipated FLR has become an essential component of
surgical planning to ensure sufficient functional liver
parenchyma remains and, consequently, to minimize
the risks of postoperative hepatic insufficiency and mor￾tality. Furthermore, the aim of volumetric analysis of the
anticipated FLR is not simply to assess the volume of the
FLR but rather to predict the function of the FLR.
Studies have demonstrated that increased FLR volume is
associated with improvements in biliary excretion, hep￾atic metabolic capacity, and postoperative liver function
tests.14–16
Precise FLR measurements are needed before
extended right hepatectomy and in selected patients
before right hepatectomy because of significant interpa￾tient variation in hepatic volumes and variable contribu￾tions of hepatic segments to the total liver volume.
Abdalla et al17 measured hepatic segment volumes in
102 Western patients without liver disease who under￾went helical computed tomography (CT) for pathologies
unrelated to the liver or biliary tree. The authors found
that, on average, the right liver (segments V to VIII)
contributes two thirds of the total liver volume (TLV),
and the left liver (segments II to IV) represents a third of
the TLV. The left lateral section (bisegment II/III)
contributes approximately half the volume of the left
liver, or 16% of the TLV. However, a large degree of
interpatient variability in liver volumes was observed,
with the right and left liver contributions to the TLV
ranging from 49 to 82% and 17 to 49%, respectively.
Notably, bisegment II/III comprised 5 to 27% of the
TLV, representing  20% of the TLV in > 75% of
patients (Fig. 1). The clinical implication of these find￾ings is the need for a systematic preoperative evaluation
of the FLR volume in patients without liver disease
scheduled to undergo extended right hepatic resection;
in addition, preoperative liver volumetry is warranted in
all patients with chronic liver disease considered for right
hepatectomy, as well as in those with normal underlying
liver parenchyma when a small left liver is suspected.
METHODS FOR FUTURE LIVER REMNANT
MEASUREMENTS
Several methods for liver volume determination have
been proposed. Although ultrasonography is not accu￾rate for volumetric measurement, 3D reconstruction of
computed tomography (CT) images correlates closely
with actual liver volume.11,18–20 Historically, CT meas￾urements of liver volumes were inaccurate due to partial￾volume effect, variability with respiratory phases, and
interobserver variation.21 However, modern advances,
including the development of helical and multidetector
CT and the availability of software for 3D reconstruc￾tion, have reduced error rates for measuring liver vol￾umes to < 5%.22 CT volumetry entails tracing the
hepatic segmental contours of each slice, measuring
the enclosed area, and multiplying the surface area by
slice thickness to calculate the volume (Fig. 2).23 Intra￾venous contrast must be administered in several phases
to delineate the vascular landmarks of the hepatic seg￾ments. Using modern techniques, CT measurements of
preoperative FLR volume have been found to correlate
linearly with actual volumes of the resected specimens.22
Because CT is routinely performed for both tumor
staging and preoperative surgical planning, 3D CT
volumetry has become the standard technique for meas￾uring FLR.16,24,25
The traditional method of measuring liver vol￾umes focused on the liver to be resected, with CT
measurements of the TLV and volume of liver to be
resected. Volumes of each tumor were measured and
subtracted from the calculation to yield a ratio of the
estimated total nontumorous remnant liver as follows:
(resected volume – tumor volume)/(TLV – tumor vol￾ume).11,19 However, this method is prone to errors in
patients with multiple tumors because of the cumulative
mathematical errors associated with multiple measure￾ments of each tumor. In addition, in patients undergoing
portal vein embolization (PVE), the atrophy of the
embolized liver may significantly influence the CT￾measured changes in TLV that follow the procedure.

Moreover, this technique does not account for the actual
functional liver volume in the presence of biliary dilation
or when the liver parenchyma is compromised by pro￾longed cholangitis or vascular obstruction.16,26,27 Direct
CT measurement of the TLV may be inaccurate in
patients with large tumors or in cirrhotic patients with
enlarged or shrunken livers. In such patients with
chronic liver disease, some investigators have adopted
algorithms incorporating functional tests, such as the
indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes, in conjunc￾tion with the extent of planned resection.11
To overcome the errors associated with traditional
liver volumetry, Urata et al24 introduced the concept of
the total estimated liver volume (TELV), based on the
observation that in adults without chronic liver disease,
liver volume correlates linearly with body size and
weight.20 They compared CT volumetry to body size
in 96 Japanese children and adults without liver disease
to generate a formula to calculate TELV based on body
surface area (BSA). They also found that in subjects
> 16 years, the TELV correlated directly with body
weight. For living donor liver transplantation, the recip￾ient body weight is used to normalize the donor graft
volume.28,29 Recently, a comparison of FLR measure￾ments standardized to body weight and BSA showed
that the two methods were highly correlated and
yielded similar results in predicting postoperative hep￾atic dysfunction.30
When applied in an autopsy study of Western
patients, Urata’s formula of TELV based on BSA was

found to underestimate TELV by an average of
323 cm3
.
31 Hence a multicenter study of Western adult
patients was undertaken to evaluate the correlation
between TELV and body size.32 Liver volumes of 292
patients from major centers in Europe and United States
were calculated from helical CT scans obtained for
conditions unrelated to the hepatobiliary system.
Pooled-sample regression analysis demonstrated that
after adjusting for BSA, age and body mass index were
not associated with TELV. A formula to estimate TELV
based on BSA was determined, with TELV ¼ 
794þ 1267  BSA (Fig. 3). The validity of this formula
was corroborated by its close correlation with two in￾dependent equations derived from Western autopsy
studies31,33 and by a meta-analysis that showed this
formula to be the least biased of 12 different formulas
and a precise method for TELV calculation.34 The
authors of the multicenter study found a consistently
high degree of correlation between TELV and BSA at

all participating centers, where different CT scanners and
3D reconstruction techniques were used. These findings
reiterate the accuracy of CT volume measurement and
show that reliable results can be obtained using different
equipment and software.
The ratio of the CT-measured FLR volume to
the TELV based on BSA yields the standardized FLR
(sFLR) volume. The sFLR provides a determination of
the percentage of the TELV that will remain after
hepatic resection. Standardized liver volumetry repre￾sents a simple, accurate, and reproducible approach that
overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional method for
liver volumetry and permits a uniform comparison of
FLR volume before hepatectomy, with or without PVE.
INDICATIONS FOR PORTAL VEIN
EMBOLIZATION BASED ON
STANDARDIZED LIVER VOLUMETRY
The minimum sFLR and indications for PVE should be
tailored to each patient and depend on many factors,
including the complexity of the anticipated resection,
simultaneous procedures, patients’ comorbidities, and
underlying liver disease. Using standardized liver
volumetry, guidelines have been proposed regarding
the minimal amount of functional liver necessary for
successful hepatic resection, based on multiple studies
demonstrating a correlation between sFLR and post￾operative outcome.5,16,35,36 In general, a sFLR of 20%
is considered the minimum safe volume needed after
extended hepatic resection in patients with normal
underlying liver, whereas an sFLR of 40% is required
in patients with cirrhosis or hepatitis. In patients who
receive extensive chemotherapy before hepatic resection,
a threshold volume for safe resection of 30% has been
proposed (Fig. 4).37 At our institution, patients with
anticipated sFLR below the minimum threshold
undergo CT volumetric analysis immediately before
and 3 to 4 weeks after PVE to assess the degree of
FLR hypertrophy. If the post-PVE sFLR remains below
the threshold volume, then an additional 3 to 4 weeks
may be required, particularly in patients with impaired
liver regeneration, such as diabetics and cirrhotics. How￾ever, in patients without liver disease, an early phase of
hypertrophy occurs during the first 3 weeks after PVE,
followed by a plateau phase in which the increase in FLR
volume is minimal.36 Thus, in patients with persistently
small sFLR 3 weeks after PVE, rapid regeneration is
unlikely to occur beyond this point.
In summary, knowledge of liver volumes is critical
to avoid postoperative hepatic insufficiency after ex￾tended resection in patients without liver disease and
after major resection in patients with liver disease.
Standardized liver volumetry represents a simple
straightforward method to estimate the FLR volume
and postoperative function that overcomes the pitfalls
associated with the traditional method of measuring liver
volumes. Minimum sFLR thresholds for safe hepatec￾tomy have been identified as 20% in patients with
normal livers, 30% in those with chemotherapy-related
liver injury, and 40% in those with chronic liver disease.
Patients with anticipated remnant liver volumes below
these cutoffs should be selected for preoperative PVE.
