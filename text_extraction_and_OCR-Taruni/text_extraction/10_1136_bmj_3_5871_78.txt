Hypertension in Renal Transplant Recipients:
Role of Bilateral Nephrectomy
SIMON L. COHEN
British Medical Journal, 1973, 3, 78-81
Summary
Of 81 transplanted kidneys which functioned for six
months or more 59 were transplanted to bilaterally
nephrectomized recipients and 22 to recipients who
retained their own kidneys. There was an excess of
hypertension in the non-nephrectomized group (17/22)
as compared to 24/59 in the nephrectomized patients,
though renal function was better in the non-nephrecto￾mized group. Hypertension became much easier to
control in two of the four non-nephrectomized recipients
in whom bilateral nephrectomy was performed after
transplantation when renal function was good.
Introduction
For many years it was the policy of the transplantation pro￾granmme at St. Mary's Hospital to perform bilateral nephrectomy
before or at the time of transplantation. On the basis of the
results obtained, Peart (1970) reported that by six to 12 months
after transplantation, even if renal function was not excellent,
the blood pressure had come down to normal levels. It was
only in the end stage of existence of the transplant that hyper￾tension once more became a serious problem.
In 1970 a change in protocol of this programme was made.
Bilateral nephrectomy was no longer performed as this entailed
considerable morbidity (WiLkinson et al., 1970) and it was felt
that there was no real evidence of benefit to the patients. It
was decided to investigate the role of bilateral nephrectomy in
the control of hypertension in transplanted patients by com￾paring the blood pressure and renal function in the non￾nephrectomized patients to the findings in the nephrectomized

recipients. Because of differig durations of follow-up the
comparison was made at an arbitrary point six months after
transplantation.
Method
The data for this study were collected by retrospective analysis of
the follow-up charts of the kidney transplant recipients. At the
six-month point after operation the patients returned to the
clinic at monthly intervals, or more frequently if the kidney was
fimctioning poorly. At least three sets of observations and
frequently four or five were made for the period of five to seven
months after operation. Means of the following parameters were
recorded-systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine,
creatinine clearance, and prednisone dosage in mg/kg-and
they were compared for the nephrectomized and non￾nephrectomized patients. In addition the records were checked
to see if the patients were receiving antihypertensive medication.
In those noted to be hypertensive at six months the charts were
analysed to determine the subsequent course of the blood
pressure and renal function. For the purposes ofthis study hyper￾tension was defined either as the presence of a sustained diastolic
blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more or the requirement of
antihypertensive drugs other than diuretics to control blood
pressure.
The patients' records before transplantation were examined
to see if they had malignant hypertension as defined by the
presence ofpapilloedema and fundal haemorrhages and exudates,
either before starting or during the dialysis period, and to find
out if hypertension was a problem during the dialysis period.
Details of any drugs required to control hypertension on dialysis
were noted. Means of blood pressure recordings taken in the
last month preceding transplantation were calculated.
The kidney transplants concerned in this study were per￾formed between 1 January 1966 and 30 September 1971. In
that time 147 kidneys were transplanted, of which.81 fiuctioned
for six months or more. These 81 are considered in this report.
Fifty-nine transplants were grafted to bilaterally nephrectomized
recipients and 22 were put into recipients who retained their own
diseased kidneys. Only four of the kidneys were from live
related donors, the remainder were cadaveric kidneys.

Results
At six months after transplantation there was a significant excess
of hypertension in the non-nephrectomized patients as compared
to the nephrectomized recipients (table I).

The actual levels of blood pressure recorded were compared,
though the patients who were hypertensive were usually receiv￾ing drug treatment for this, and so the difference in recorded
levels has been reduced (table II). Though blood pressure is
significantly higher in the non-nephrectomized patients renal

compared in the two groups of hypertensive patients it is
significantly better in the non-nephrectomized group. There
is a significant difference in renal function between the normo￾tensive and hypertensive patients in the nephrectomized group,
suggesting that hypertension in this group may be related to
poor renal function. (Mean creatinine clearance ± S.E. of

in the hypertensives of this group. Both differences are sig￾nificant, P <0 001 by Student's t test.) Though function in the
normotensive patients in the group retaining their own kidneys
is better than that of the hypertensives, this difference is not
significant. It would appear too that renal function in the
normotensive non-nephrectomized patients may be better than
the renal function of the normotensive nephrectomized group,
though these differences are not significant.
There was a similar incidence of hypertension in association
with poor renal function, as defined by a creatinine clearance
of less than 50 ml/min and serum creatinine of more than 1.5
mg/100 ml in the two groups, occurring in nine out of 59 non￾nephrectomized and five out of 22 nephrectomized recipients.
Hypertension was transient-that is, it disappeared later in the
course of the transplantation in a similar proportion of neph￾rectomized and non-nephrectomized patients (eight out of 59
as compared to three out of 22). Transient hypertension in
one patient in the non-nephrectomized group was caused by
stenosis of the renal artery of the transplant and was
abolished by repair of the stenosis. Postoperatively he remained
normotensive without drugs and his renal function improved
from a creatinine clearance of 70 ml/min with a serum creatinine
of 1-5 mg/100 ml to a clearance of around 120 ml/min with a
serum creatinine of 1 mg/100 ml. There was a significant
difference in incidence of persistent hypertension occurring
in the presence of continuing good renal function in nine out
of 22 of the recipients retaining their own kidneys as compared
to four out of 59 of the nephrectomized patients (X2 = 11A4,
P < 0001). Another three nephrectomized recipients were
hypertensive at six months with good renal function but
subsequently their renal fumction deteriorated. In these
patients the presence of hypertension heralded the decline in
renal function.
Hypertension before transplantation was reviewed to see if
the nephrectomized and non-nephrectomized patients differed
in incidence or severity of hypertensioni at that stage. The
incidence of malignant and dialysis-resistant hypertension￾that is, hypertension which cannot be controlled by ultrafiltra￾tion and sodium restriction alone-was similar in the two
groups. It must be emphasized that in many patients with
malignant hypertension on entering the programme blood
pressure is readily controlled by dialysis alone. Conversely,
some patients in whom hypertension does not appear to be
severe at the time of starting dialysis experience great difficulty
in control of blood pressure and appear resistant to dialysis
alone. No patients who were normotensive on starting dialysis
became hypertensive during their period on dialysis.
The mean blood pressure ± S.E. of mean of the nephrecto￾mized recipients in the month preceding transplantation was
146-2 ± 2-9/94 7 ± 2-2 mm Hg, and for the recipients who
retained their own kidneys 152-6 ± 4-0/95-1 + 2-6 mm Hg.
These figures are not significantly different by Student's t test.
When comparing the pretransplantation blood pressure with
the value at six months the only significant difference was for
the fall in systolic pressure in the nephrectomized group.
Of the 17 patienats in the nephrectomized group in whom
hypertension was a problem in spite of dialysis only four
remained hypertensive in the presence of good renal function
after transplantation, whereas three of the five dialysis-resistant
hypertensives among the non-nephrectomized group subse￾quently had hypertension with a transplanted kidney functioning
well.
It has been suggested that hypertension late in the course of
successful renal transplantation may be related to the dose of
steroids required for immunosuppression (Starzl et al., 1964).
This factor was examined in these patients and there was no
significant difference in prednisone dosage between the neph￾rectomized and non-nephrectomized groups or between the
hypertensive or normotensive patients.
Since starting this study, bilateral nephrectomy has been
performed on four patients in the non-nephrectomized group in
whom large doses of hypotensive agents were required in the
post-transplantation period. All four of these patients had had
malignant hypertension before starting dialysis and in all of
them great difficulty had been experienced in control of hyper￾tension during the dialysis period. As a routine, arteriography
of the transplant to exclude renal artery stenosis was perforned
before the bilateral nephrectomy. Two of these patients had
poor renal function at the time of bilateral nephrectomy, and
though the amount of drugs required to control hyper￾tension fell transiently in both cases hypertension returned
and within six months in one patient renal function had
deteriorated so far that the graft was removed. In the other

patient the renal function remained unchanged, but he soon
needed very large doses of hypotensive drugs (table IV). In the
other two patients who were nephrectomized when transplant
function was excellent renal function remained excellent and
blood pressure control was achieved with very much smaller
doses of hypotensive agents.
Discussion
There are a number of well-recognized causes of hypertension in
renal transplant recipients-namely, acute rejection episodes
(Starzl et al., 1963), deterioration of renal function due to
chronic rejection (Starzl et al., 1964; Ducrot et al., 1965), and
the development of renal artery stenosis (Ducrot et al., 1965).
The results of this study confirm that persisting hypertension
in renal transplant recipients may be related to rejection of the
kidney as shown by deteriorating renal function or the develop￾ment of renal artery stenosis, but also the presence of the
recipient's own diseased kidneys is an important factor. The
significance of the presence of the original kidneys is underlined
by the fact that in our non-nephrectomized patients renal
function was usually very good in the presnce of hypertension,
and further this hypertension was dramatically improved in two
patients in whom bilateral nephrectomy was done when the
transplant was functioning well. These findings are in agreement
with those of Papadimitriou et al. (1969) who recommended
bilateral nephrectomy for patients who had persistent hyper￾tension after transplantation.
Other studies of blood pressure after transplantation do not
agree with the findings described here, but in none of these
studies (Ducrot et al., 1965; Stokes et al., 1970) was differentia￾tion made between hypertensive recipients with or without
good fimction. Stokes et al. (1970) found that hypertension after
successful renal transplantation could not be related to the
presence or absence of the recipient's own kidneys but there was
a correlation between hypertension during dialysis and after
transplantation.
Ducrot et al. (1965) stated that blood pressure returned to
normal even- when the kidneys of the recipient were left in situ.
But of the 32 transplants they reported, 15 were in nephrecto￾mized recipients, 11 of the remaining recipients were nephrecto￾mized within seven months after transplantation, and only two
patients who had not been nephrectomized had been followed
for more than six months at that time.
It must be conceded that the levels of hypertension seen after
transplantation are not very severe, but it is nevertheless inter￾esting that some patients in this series remain hypertensive in
spite of a normally functioning transplanted kidney. It is
possible that after transplantation of this third kidney the blood
flow to the recipient's own diseased kidneys is further diminished,
and this could result in the release of pressor substances. Of five
patients who had "dialysis resistant" hypertension in the non￾nephrectomized group, three had hypertension in the presence
of excellent transplant function. All four of the patients in the
non-nephrectomized group who were subsequently nephrecto￾mized had had malignant hypertension before transplantation.
There has been much interest in the subject of hypertension
in end-stage renal disease, particularly since anephric patients
can now survive for prolonged periods, thus making it possible
to study the role of the kidney in the hypertension of terminal
renal failure. Merrill et al. (1961) studied four anephric patients
and found that hypertension appeared only as a result of excess
hydration.
Kolffet al. (1964) extended these findings, and in a study of the
effect of bilateral nephrectomy on hypertension in man showed
that bilateral nephrectomy did not always facilitate the control
of hypertension. Bilateral nephrectomy was performed in 10
of their patients; in six control of blood pressure was easier
after this operation, but in the remaining four there was little
change. They reported high renin content of kidneys removed
from patients whose hypertension was controlled by bilateral
nephrectomy.
Some workers studying blood pressure in patients with
chronic renal failure treated by intermittent haemodialysis have
reported that hypertension may be controlled by dialysis and
dietary salt and water restriction alone without recourse to
bilateral nephrectomy (Comty et al., 1964) or hypotensive drugs
(Craswell et al., 1972). Most dialysis units are unable to re￾produce these results. Vertes et al. (1969) described two patterns
of response to achievement- of dry weight, defined as the weight
at which the patient was clinically free of oedema, and hypoten￾sion could be transiently induced by further acute weight
reduction in 40 patients with end-stage renal disease. Of the
40 patients, 35 remained normotensive without hypotensive
therapy as long as dry weight was maintained, but in the other
five hypertension persisted in spite of ultrafiltration and sodium
restriction. It responded poorly to drug therapy but bilateral
nephrectomy resulted in lowering of-the pressure. These five
patients had high renina levels and Vertes et al. (1969) suggested
that plasma renin levels might predict response of blood pressure
to dialysis. Wilkinson et at. (1970) reported that three patients
in whom bilateral nephrectomy did not result in a lowering of
blood pressure had plasma' renin levels much lower than their
patients whose hypertension did respond to bilateral neph￾rectomy. Weidmann et al. (1971) reported on 18 patients in
terminal renal failure with dialysis and drug resistant hyper￾tension; only one patient in this group did not benefit from
nephrectomy and this was the only one in the group whose
plasma renin activity was not raised. Plasma renin studies were
not performed in our groun of patients, but it is interesting to
note that Verniory et al. (1972) reported that in terminal renal
failure the kidney can secrete renin in response to haemorrhage
or other stimuli.
In three nephrectomized patients hypertension at six months
heralded progressive decline in renal function with resulting
loss of the transplant. It is difficult, however, to explain how
four of the 59 nephrectomnized recipients had persistent hyper￾tension despite excellent renal function. It is possible that these
four had vascular lesions in the transplant capable of producing
hypertension but as yet not severe enough to cause impairment
of the tests of renal function used in this study. Alternatively

they could conceivably have an extareal cause for the hyper￾tension. It is well known that- renin, angiotensin I, and angio￾tensin II are measurable in the blood of many anephric patients
(Medina et al., 1972).
From the data presented here it would seem reasonable to
conclude that the presence of diseased kidneys alone is sufficient
to sustain hypertension in some transplant patients in the
presence of a normally functioning transplant. This would
suggest that the normal kidney does not produce a depressor
substance but the diseased kidneys in spite of their minimal
blood flow are still able to produce a pressor effect.
It is of interest that the mean renal function in all our non￾nephrectomized recipients was better than in the nephrecto￾mized patients compared six months after transplantation. This
could possibly be related to improvements in technique, as the
patients who retained their kidneys were transplanted more
recently.
Finally, in non-nephrectomized recipients, if hypertension
persists despite good transplant finction, if rejection and renal
artery stenosis are excluded, bilateral nephrectomy may be
indicated. In the four patients in this series who were bilaterally
nephrectomized for hypertension after transplantation (table
IV), hypertension became significantly easier to control in
two, both of whom had good renal function. In the other two
patients hypertension was ameliorated only temporarily by
removal of their original kidneys. Five months after the bilateral
nephrectomy irreversible decline in transplant function occurred
in one patient who had become severely hypertensive again.
Histology of this transplant showed severe obliterative arterial
lesions. As none of the transplants in the other three patients
were biopsied the possible contribution of vascular lesions in
the kidney to their hypertension r s conjectural.
I would like to thank Professor W. S. Peart and Dr. B. Hulme for
their helpful comments and for allowing me to study patients under
their care, Mr. K. Owen, Mr. J. R. Kenyon, and Mr. M. E. Snell who

Summary
Humoral and ceilular immunity have been investigated
in 15 patients with dystrophia myotonica. No abnormali￾ties in total serum levels of the five major immuno￾globulin classes were found but there was a rise in the
mean serum level of P1A complement. Altogether, 54%
of patients fafled to make antibody to tetanus toxoid as
compared with 1% of controls: 13% of patients failed to
make antibody to Salmonella typhi H antigen as compa￾red with no failure of this function in control subjects.
There was a reduced uptake of tritiated thymi4ine by
whole blood lymphocyte cultures spontaneously, while
in the presence of phytohaemagglutlnn (PHA) and both
autologous and fetad calf serum the uptake was
normal. It is suggested that there may be a wider derange￾ment ofimmunological function in dystrophia myotonica
than previously thought.

Introduction
Reduced serum levels of gammaglobulin have been found in
many patients with dystrophia myotonica by some workers
(Lowenthal and van Sande, 1956; Kuhn and Weicker, 1957) but
not by others (Oppenheimer and Milhorat, 1961). These reduced
levels were observed to be associated with a reduction in the
half life of 181I4-labeled ganmaglobulin (Zinneman and Rotstein,
1956). With the delineation of the various immunoglobulin
classes it was found that there were reduced serum levels. and
increased catabolism of immunoglobulin (Ig) G (Wochner et al.,
1966), though a more recent report suggested that serum levels
of IgM may also be reduced (Bundey et al., 1970). These
abnormalities prompted a more comprehensive investigation of
immunological function in this disease.
Patients and Methods
Altogether, 15 patients were studied, including two pairs of
siblings and one mother and daughter. Each patient had charac￾teristic clinical features and showed the classical electro￾myographic changes of dystrophia myotonica. It is difficult to be
certain of the duration of clinical symptoms, but the average
was 10 years and ranged from five to 16 years. There were eight
men and seven women, with ages ranging between 30 and 71
years (see table II). Two patients were in institutions, the rest
living at home. Two patients were receiving digoxin and
