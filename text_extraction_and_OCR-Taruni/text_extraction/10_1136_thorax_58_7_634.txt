Abstract
There are currently three surgical treatments for emphysema:
bullectomy, lung transplantation, and lung volume reduction
surgery (LVRS). Unfortunately, most emphysema patients are poor
candidates for any surgical intervention. A meticulous selection
process is favoured in which indications and contraindications are
considered and the best solution is devised for each patient. Patients
with giant bullae filling half the thoracic volume and compressing
relatively normal adjacent parenchyma are offered bullectomy;
those with hyperinflation, heterogeneous distribution of
destruction, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) >20%,
and a normal carbon dioxide tension (Pco2) are offered LVRS; and
patients with diffuse disease, lower FEV1, hypercapnia, and
associated pulmonary hypertension are directed towards
transplantation. Using these criteria, few patients are serious
candidates for surgical procedures. Combinations of LVRS and lung
transplantation, either simultaneously or sequentially, are possible
but rarely necessary.
