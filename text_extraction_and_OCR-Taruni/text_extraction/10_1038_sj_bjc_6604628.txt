Advanced biliary tract carcinomas (BTCs) are often diagnosed at an advanced/metastatic stage and have a poor prognosis. The
combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) has shown promising activity in this setting. This international phase II study
evaluated the efficacy and safety of GEMOX as first-line therapy in patients with advanced BTCs. Eligible patients with previously
untreated locally advanced or metastatic BTC received gemcitabine 1000 mg m2 (day 1) and oxaliplatin 100 mg m2 (day 2), every
2 weeks. Seventy patients were enroled; 72.9% had metastatic disease. Sixty-seven patients were treated. There were 10 confirmed
partial responses (14.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.4 – 25.7%) in the treated population (RECIST). Twenty-four patients
(35.8 %) had stable disease. The objective response rate was 20.5% in patients with non-gallbladder cancers (9/44 patients) and
4.3% in patients with gallbladder cancers (1/23). Median overall survival for the intent-to-treat population was 8.8 months (95% CI,
6.9 – 11.1%) and progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95% CI, 2.5 – 4.6%). Grade 3/4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia
(14.9% of patients), alanine aminotransferase elevation (13.4%), anaemia (10.4%), neutropenia (11.9%) and pain (11.9%). In this study,
GEMOX demonstrated activity in non-gallbladder carcinoma, but poor activity in gallbladder carcinoma. GEMOX is well tolerated
in advanced BTCs.

Biliary tract carcinomas (BTCs), comprising gallbladder carcinoma
(GBC) and intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CC), are
relatively rare in the United States and Europe (de Groen et al,
1999). For example, approximately 5000 cases of GBC and 2000 –
3000 cases of CC are diagnosed annually in the United States.
There are marked geographical variations in the incidence of GBC,
although it is consistently more common in women than in men
(Lazcano-Ponce et al, 2001). The symptoms of BTC are non￾specific and tumours have often reached an advanced stage at
diagnosis. As such, the prognosis for patients with BTC is
extremely poor: median survival is generally lesser than 6 months
and estimated 1- and 2-year survival rates are 25 and 13%,
respectively (Patel, 2002). Chemotherapy is a palliative treatment
option for patients with advanced disease. Owing to the lack of
randomised phase III studies, there is no standard chemotherapy
for advanced BTC. One clinical trial has demonstrated the
improved survival for chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil plus leuco￾vorin with or without etoposide) vs best supportive care (Glimelius
et al, 1996), although the ability of chemotherapy to prolong
survival remains to be confirmed.
Tolerability is of major importance when selecting palliative
treatment regimens. Gemcitabine has palliative benefits and is
generally well tolerated as therapy for advanced pancreatic
carcinoma (Heinemann, 2002). Gemcitabine is also widely used
as palliative therapy for advanced BTCs because of histogenetic
similarities between the pancreas and biliary tract (Scheithauer,
2002).
Gemcitabine has shown promising activity against advanced
BTCs, with response rates (RRs) in the range of 12 –35% when
used in combination with agents such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin,
mitomycin C, or capecitabine (Kornek et al, 2004; Alberts et al,
2005; Kim et al, 2006; Riechelmann et al, 2007; Lee et al, 2008). A
recent randomised phase II study suggested that combination
chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin may be more
effective than gemcitabine alone (Valle et al, 2006). The overall
RR (ORR) was 24.3% for combination therapy and 15.2% for
gemcitabine alone (complete response (CR) þ partial response
(PR) þ stable disease (SD) was 75.7 vs 57.6%, respectively). Time to
progression was also longer in the combination group (8.0
months) than in the monotherapy group (5.5 months). A follow￾up study has been initiated with adequate power to assess the
potential survival benefit of adding cisplatin to gemcitabine.

Clinical Studies

Oxaliplatin was used as monotherapy in one phase II study as
first-line treatment for patients with BTC. An objective RR of
20.6% was observed with an overall survival (OS) of 7 months
(Androulakis et al, 2006). Preclinical studies have demonstrated
antitumour activity for the combination of gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in human leukaemia and colorectal cancer
cell lines and provide the rationale for using this combination in
clinical studies. An optimal sequence-dependent synergy is
apparent, with exposure to gemcitabine first and oxaliplatin later
(Faivre et al, 1999).
A French phase II study (conducted in two centres) showed that
the GEMOX combination was active and well tolerated as first-line
chemotherapy in 36 patients with advanced BTCs (Andre´ et al,
2004); ORR (without confirmed response for all patients) was
35.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 18.7 –52.3%), progression￾free survival (PFS) was 5.7 months and OS was 15.4 months. We
undertook the present international phase II study to evaluate the
efficacy and tolerability of GEMOX as first-line chemotherapy in a
larger group of patients with advanced BTCs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eligibility criteria
Patients aged 418 years with histologically proven, locally
advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the biliary tract (gallbladder,
intrahepatic bile ducts, extrahepatic bile ducts and ampulla of
Vater) were enroled in the study. Other eligibility criteria included:
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status p2;
unidimensionally measurable disease (Therasse et al, 2000); no
prior chemotherapy for advanced disease; and adequate haema￾tological (absolute neutrophil count 41.5  109 l
1
, platelets
4100  109 l
1
), renal (creatinine o1.5  the upper limit of
normal; ULN), and hepatic function (alanine aminotransferase
o5  ULN; bilirubin o2.5  ULN). Patients with jaundice or
evidence of bile duct obstruction and in whom the biliary tree
could be decompressed by endoscopic percutaneous endoprosth￾esis, with a subsequent reduction in bilirubin to o2.5  ULN, were
also eligible.
Patients with prior malignancy or prior chemotherapy for
advanced disease, central nervous system metastases or peripheral
neuropathy grade X2 were excluded from the study. Prior
radiation therapy within 4 weeks of the first gemcitabine
administration was not permitted. Women of childbearing
potential were required to be neither pregnant nor breastfeeding
and to be under active contraception.
The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical
Practice. All patients provided written informed consent.
Treatment plan
Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1000 mg m2 as a 100-min i.v.
infusion on day 1 followed by oxaliplatin 100 mg m2 as a 2-h i.v.
infusion on day 2. Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. Treatment
was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
patient withdrawal of consent, or treatment delay of more than
3 weeks.
Oxaliplatin was stopped altogether for grade 3 neurological
symptoms but could be reintroduced upon recovery (to grade
p2). For paraesthesia without pain that persisted between cycles
(lasting greater than 14 days), oxaliplatin was stopped until
recovery, and then restarted at 75 mg m2
. For paraesthesia with
pain or functional impairment that persisted for greater than 7 but
fewer than 14 days, the dose of oxaliplatin was reduced to
75 mg m2
; if the pain or functional impairment persisted between
cycles, oxaliplatin was stopped. In the event of pharyngolaryngeal
dysaesthesia during an infusion, the duration of oxaliplatin
infusion was extended to 6 h for that and for subsequent infusions.
For patients with a platelet count o75  109 l
1
, treatment was
delayed for up to 3 weeks to allow recovery, and the oxaliplatin
dose was reduced by 15% in subsequent cycles. For grade 3/4
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhoea or asthenia,
the dose of gemcitabine was reduced to 800 mg m2 over 80 min
and the dose of oxaliplatin was reduced to 85 mg m2 over 2 h. If
grade 3/4 toxicity developed after dose reduction, the patient could
be withdrawn from the study. In the event of oxaliplatin
discontinuation for any toxicity, gemcitabine could be continued
at the same dose and same schedule (every 2 weeks).
Assessments and follow-up
Tumour response was evaluated after four treatment cycles and
every four cycles thereafter using the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumours (RECIST) unidimensional criteria (Therasse
et al, 2000). Objective responses were to be confirmed after at least
4 weeks. Tumour burden was assessed in both target and non￾target lesions. Target lesions were defined as lesions that were
measurable in at least one dimension, with the longest diameter
X20 mm using conventional techniques or the longest diameter
X10 mm measured using spiral computed tomographic (CT) scan.
Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans
were the only accepted imaging techniques for the determination
of response. Non-target lesions were defined as all other lesions
and non-measurable lesions. The integrated response was derived
from the investigator’s assessment of target and non-target lesions,
taking into account the appearance of new lesions in accordance
with RECIST. For target lesions, SD was categorised as neither
sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to
qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking the the smallest sum of
the longest diameter as reference since the treatment started; for
non-target lesions, SD was categorised as neither CR or PD.
Assignment to the SD category could only be made at least 6 weeks
(two cycles) after the start of treatment. The best overall response
was determined following a sequential review of all integrated
responses recorded from the start of treatment until disease
progression, with the last evaluation taken as the 30-day post￾treatment follow-up. Sequential evaluations were compared, and
the best response from each pair was compared with the
subsequent pair to derive the best overall response.
For patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than
disease progression, tumour evaluations were performed every 2
months. Whenever possible, the follow-up was continued until
death.
Safety evaluations were performed in the exposed population
before administration of each cycle and toxicity was graded using
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.
End points and statistics
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
(based on RR) of the GEMOX regimen as first-line therapy in
patients with advanced BTCs and rejecting the treatment for
further study, if it was found to be insufficiently active. The study
employed a one-stage design (Fleming, 1982) incorporating the
following assumptions: H0: RR p20% and H1: RR X35%. On the
assumption that of 56 evaluable patients, using a significance level
of 0.05 and a power of 80%, GEMOX would be declared
insufficiently active if p12 responses were observed, and declared
active if 412 responses were observed. To be evaluable for
response, patients were to receive a minimum of two cycles of
GEMOX (ie, 6 weeks on study) and were to have had at least one
post-baseline tumour assessment unless early progression
occurred first, in which case, patients were considered evaluable
for response. Assuming that 25% of patients would have

Clinical Studies

non-measurable disease, a sample of 70 patients was required, so
that a total of 56 patients attained the requirements of the
evaluable patient population.
An exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate RRs by
tumour type (GBC and CC). Kaplan –Meier survival curves were
computed for time-to-event variables. Progression-free survival
was calculated from the date of first treatment administration to
the earliest date of disease progression, death or data cutoff.
Overall survival was calculated from the date of first treatment
administration to the date of death. Safety was reported for all
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between April 2003 and April 2005, 70 patients were enroled in the
study, which was conducted in seven centres in France (2),
Germany (2), Austria (1), Chile (1) and the United Kingdom (1).
Patient and tumour characteristics at baseline are shown in
Table 1.
Treatment received
Three patients did not receive study treatment: two died before
starting treatment (one with GBC, one with CC) and one patient
with CC had hyperbilirubinaemia. The exposed population,
therefore, comprised 67 patients. In total, 479 cycles of oxaliplatin
and 521 cycles of gemcitabine were administered. The median
number of cycles was five for both oxaliplatin (range: 1 –18 cycles)
and gemcitabine (range: 1 –30 cycles). Mean relative dose
intensities were 94.1% for oxaliplatin and 98.4% for gemcitabine
in the exposed population.
The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was disease
progression (48 patients; 68.6%). Ten patients (14.3%) discon￾tinued treatment as a result of adverse events (AEs), which were
considered to be oxaliplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions in
three patients (4.3%). Five patients continued treatment with
gemcitabine alone after discontinuing oxaliplatin.
Efficacy
There were 10 PRs (14.9%;. 95% CI, 7.4 –25.7%) in the exposed
population (Table 2). A further five unconfirmed PRs were
observed in the exposed population (three GBCs and three CCs).
The majority of responses were observed in patients with CC: PRs
were observed for 9/44 patients (20.5%) with CC and 1/23 patients
(4.3%) with GBC.
Median PFS was 3.4 months (95% CI, 2.5 –4.6 months) for both
the ITT and exposed populations (Figure 1A). Median PFS was 2.5
months for patients with GBC (95% CI, 1.6 –4.3 months) and 3.8
months for patients with CC (95% CI, 2.7 –5.6 months; Figure 1B).
Overall, 59 deaths were reported during the study period in the
ITT population, 57 of which were in the exposed population. One
patient died 1 month after the study cutoff date, but was
considered alive for the purpose of the survival analysis. Median
OS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 6.9 –11.1 months) in the ITT
population and 9.3 months (95% CI, 6.9 –11.4 months) in the
exposed population (Figure 2A). For both populations, median OS
was 11.0 months for patients with non-GBC and 6.1 months for
patients with GBC (Figure 2B).
Safety
Sixty-seven patients received at least one administration of study
treatment and were included in the safety analysis. There were six
deaths during the treatment period (between cycle 1 and cycle 4),
none of which was considered by the investigators to be treatment￾related. However, after reviewing the patient data, the sponsor
could not rule out a relationship to study treatment for three
deaths; one patient developed septicaemia and had global status
deterioration, one patient had diarrhoea and vomiting leading to
the rapid health deterioration and respiratory arrest, and one
patient died from general health deterioration.
Overall, nausea (82.1%) and vomiting (56.7%) of all grades were
frequent side effects, despite systemic prophylactic measures
(Table 3). Grade 3 nausea and vomiting occurred in 4.5% and
10.4% of patients, respectively, although there were no grade 4
events of this type. Overall, grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 47 patients
(70.1%).
Peripheral sensory neuropathies were observed in 67.2% of
patients, with grade 3 neuropathy in 6.0%, including one case of

laryngospasm. No grade 4 neuropathy was reported. In general,
neuropathies were mild (grade 1) and intermittent during the first
treatment cycles but tended to worsen and become more persistent
as the number of treatment cycles increased. Neurotoxicity grade
X2 occurred in 40% of patients who received X9 treatment cycles.
Other frequently reported AEs included anaemia (77.6%), fatigue
(73.1%), thrombocytopenia (68.7%), liver enzyme increase
(62.7%), and weight loss (61.2%), although the majority of these
events were grade 1/2 in severity.
DISCUSSION
This study is one among the largest of the phase II studies
conducted to date to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
chemotherapy in patients with advanced BTCs. The majority of
patients enroled in this study had metastatic disease. The GEMOX
administered every 2 weeks was well tolerated and conferred an
ORR of 14.9%, with 50.7 % of patients achieving a PR or SD.
The ORR is somewhat lower than previously reported for
GEMOX (Andre´ et al, 2004) or for gemcitabine in combination
with other chemotherapy agents (Kim et al, 2006; Eckel and
Schmid, 2007; Riechelmann et al, 2007; Lee et al, 2008). Our goal of
achieving a 20% RR in this phase II study was not reached, when
responses were assessed using RECIST. However, the percentage of
combined confirmed and unconfirmed PR (23.9%) was more in
line with other published phase II studies in advanced BTCs, the
majority of which report RRs that are often unconfirmed, as
opposed to using RECIST confirmed responses. In our study, most
unconfirmed PRs were those that did not persist from one
assessment to the next (tumour response evaluation every
2 months).

Clinical Studies

There is currently no standard chemotherapy regimen for
advanced BTCs. Gemcitabine is one of the most widely used agents
in this setting, with RRs of 12 –35% for gemcitabine-based
combination regimens, although these rates are unconfirmed in
the majority of studies. A pooled analysis of studies (112 studies,
including one phase III study; 2810 patients) performed between
1985 and 2006 demonstrated that the combination of gemcitabine
with platinum compounds increased RRs and tumour-control
rates compared with gemcitabine alone (Eckel and Schmid, 2007).
Response rates of 22 –50% have been observed in single-institution
studies, with OS of 7.6 –15.4 months (Andre´ et al, 2004; Harder
et al, 2006; Verderame et al, 2006). However, single-institution
studies often report higher RRs than multinational studies.
For this study, we conducted an experimental subgroup analysis
to assess response to treatment in patients with GBC and CC. Our
study population comprised approximately one-third of the
patients with GBC, who are generally considered to have a worse
prognosis than patients with other BTCs (Gallardo et al, 2005). In
BTC, prognostic factors could be more important than therapy
itself in determining treatment outcome. This study confirms the
differential outcome between the gallbladder compared with other
cancers of the biliary tree, as observed by Gallardo et al (2005).
In the pooled analysis by Eckel and Schmid (2007), the median
RR for trials in patients with GBC was higher than that in patients
with CC (35.5 vs 17.7%; P ¼ 0.008). However, the response duration
is short for GBC, and OS was significantly longer in trials of
patients with CC compared with GBC (median 9.3 vs 7.2 months;
P ¼ 0.048) (Eckel and Schmid, 2007). In our study, RRs and
RR þ SD values in the GBC and CC subgroups were 4.0 vs 20.0%
and 40 vs 53%, respectively. Concerning the survival, GBC was
associated with a shorter PFS duration than CC (2.5 vs 3.8 months,
respectively) and shorter median OS (6.1 vs 11.0 months,
respectively). The reported efficacy,especially for GBC, differed
markedly from a previous study of GEMOX in BTC, where the RR
(unconfirmed) and OS were higher for GBC (n ¼ 11) vs CC (n ¼ 16;
54.4 vs 21.4%; 16.0 vs 14.5 months; Andre´ et al, 2004). The
differences in the results of the two studies are surprising and
could be related to the small number of patients, a centre effect, or
the inclusion of unconfirmed responses.
The combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin was generally
well tolerated. Grade 3/4 AEs were reported in 70.1% of patients,
although all patients experienced at least one AE of any grade. As
previously observed with the GEMOX combination (Andre´ et al,
2004), the most frequent grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, pain and vomiting, all of which occurred in
o15% of patients. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia appear to
occur less frequently with the GEMOX regimen than with the
combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (Park et al, 2006; Lee
et al, 2008; Meyerhardt et al, 2008). Patients with advanced BTCs
are very susceptible to infection and disease progression. There￾fore, caution will be necessary with GEMOX chemotherapy like all
chemotherapies in this disease. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was
uncommon (6.0%).
In conclusion, this multinational study provides further evidence
for the activity of GEMOX as a treatment for non-GBC, but also
demonstrates the poor activity of this agent in GBCs. The
combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin is well tolerated and
provides a treatment option for patients with advanced BTCs, and in
particular non-GBCs. A phase III study comparing GEMOX to
gemcitabine is necessary to further establish the role of GEMOX in
advanced BTCs. The design of such a study should include
stratification for the location of the carcinoma (non-GBCs vs GBCs).
