Polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) were 
recently identifi ed, mainly in respiratory specimens from 
children. Among 200 patients with respiratory disorders ad￾mitted to Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France, KIPyV was 
detected in 8% and WUPyV in 1%. KIPyV was signifi cantly 
more frequent among human stem cell transplant patients 
(17.8% vs. 5.1%; p = 0.01). 
Recently, 2 new, distinct polyomaviruses (PyVs), KI 
(KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV), were identifi ed in re￾spiratory specimens, mainly from children <5 years of age 
with respiratory tract infections. The fi rst retrospective 
studies of respiratory specimens in Sweden and Australia 
showed a KIPyV prevalence of 1% and 2.5%, respectively 
(1,2). Studies conducted in Australia and the United States 
showed a WUPyV prevalence in respiratory specimens of 
3% and 0.7%, respectively (3). Further studies conducted 
in Canada and South Korea have shown similar frequencies 
(4,5). In this study, we examined the prevalence of KIPyV 
and WUPyV in immunocompromised patients with sus￾pected respiratory tract infections.
The Study
From January through June 2007, 265 respiratory sam￾ples were received in the laboratory of Saint Louis Hospital, 
Paris: 154 nasal aspirates (NA) and 111 bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) specimens collected from 200 patients with 
suspected upper or lower respiratory tract infections. This 
hospital specializes in the management of immunocompro￾mised patients. Respiratory samples were collected for the 
diagnosis of acute respiratory illness; 89% of samples were 
from immunocompromised patients. Their median age was 
46 years (range 3.6–85.3 years). Given the observational 
nature of the study, French law did not require ethical ap￾proval or informed consent.
The specimens were routinely tested for infl uenza A 
and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfl uenza 
viruses 1, 2, and 3 by immunofl uorescence assay (Imagen; 
DakoCytomation, Trappes, France). Specimens positive for 
KIPyV or WUPyV were tested for adenoviruses; human 
bocavirus; human rhinoviruses; human metapneumovirus; 
human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1; and hu￾man PyVs BK and JC by using PCR methods (6–11). To￾tal nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μL of NA, BAL, 
or stool specimens by using the EasyMag System (bio￾Mérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). KIPyV was detected 
with an in-house real-time PCR assay targeting the VP1
gene. The primers and hydrolysis probe were designed 
by using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosys￾tems, Foster City, CA, USA). The fi nal reaction volume 
was 25 μL and contained 12.5 pmol of SLKI-VP1s (5′-
GGAAATACAGCTGCTCAGGAT-3′) and SLKI-VP1as 
(5′-CTTTGATACTTGAACCGCTTTCCTT-3′), 6.25 pmol 
of corresponding probe SLKI-VP1PR (5′-6FAM-C
GTGACCCCACCCCTCATTACTGGTC-TAMRA-3′), 
12.5 μL of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosys￾tems), and 5 μL of DNA extract. The reaction was run on 
a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The 
specifi city of positive specimens was confi rmed by using 
PCR and nested PCR with primers POLVP1–39F/POLVP1–
363R and POLVP1–118F/POLVP1–324R, as described 
(1). The PCR products were then sequenced and compared 
with the previously described sequences from Sweden and 
Australia (GenBank accession nos. EF127906, EF127907, 
EF127908, EF520287, EF520288, and EF520289). WUPyV 
was detected by PCR as described (3). PCR products with 
the expected molecular weights were sequenced by using 
primers AG0044 and AG0045 and compared to published 
sequences (GenBank accession nos. EF444550, EF444551, 
EF444552, EF444553, and EF444554) (3).
KIPyV was detected in 17 (6.5%) of the 265 respira￾tory samples and in 16 (8.0%) of the 200 patients. All cases 
were confi rmed by a nested PCR targeting another region 
of the VP1 gene. Twelve of the 17 PCR products were suc￾cessfully sequenced, and all shared 100% homology with 
published sequences. WUPyV was detected in only 2 pa￾tients (1.0%). Genome sequencing showed 98% homology 
with reported WUPyV sequences.
Six KIPyV-positive patients (37.5%) had co-infections 
with other respiratory viruses, and 2 of them (12.5%) had 
a pulmonary bacterial infection (online Appendix Table, 
available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/1/107-appT.
htm). One WUPyV-infected patient who exhibited acute 
respiratory failure had concomitant pneumonia caused by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. None of the 15 pa￾tients who were positive for KIPyV or WUPyV and tested 
for fungi had respiratory or blood samples positive for 
Aspergillus spp.

The clinical characteristics of the patients with KIPyV or 
WUPyV infection and their general outcome until December 
2007 are given in the online Appendix Table. All but 3 had 
well-identifi ed systemic immunosuppression. However, all 
had severe coexisting conditions. All KIPyV- and WUPyV￾positive patients had acute respiratory disorders.
Eight KIPyV-positive patients had received allogeneic 
stem cell transplants; 5 of them had exhibited profound 
neutropenia in the 2 weeks before the respiratory sample 
was found to be positive. The detection of KIPyV was sig￾nifi cantly more frequent among hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients than among other patients 
(17.8% [8/45] vs. 5.1% [8/155], p = 0.01) (Table). Lung 
or sinus imaging was assessed by computed tomography 
scan for 12 KIPyV-positive patients. Lung parenchyma 
abnormalities were noted in 9 patients, and sinusitis was 
diagnosed for 2 patients.
Taking into consideration both the frequency of diges￾tive symptoms in our patients and the former published de￾tection of KIPyV in a stool sample, we looked for KIPyV 
infection in the available stool samples while the respirato￾ry samples were being assessed for KIPyV (1). Strikingly, 
3 of 4 samples tested were positive for KIPyV (with cycle 
threshold values of 35.0, 38.3, and 40.3). All were collected 
from HSCT recipients. In addition, 1 HSCT patient who 
experienced diarrhea demonstrated persistent excretion of 
KIPyV in 9 consecutive stool specimens collected between 
June and the end of November 2007 (data not shown).
Conclusions
This study shows the prevalence of KIPyV and 
WUPyV among immunocompromised patients with respi￾ratory disorders. Previously, these 2 viruses had been ob￾served mainly in young children (1–3). Of the few adult pa￾tients with KIPyV or WUPyV infection mentioned in these 
studies, most were immunocompromised (3,12).
Considering the seemingly higher prevalence of KIP￾yV in our population (8%), immunocompromised patients 
may be more susceptible to this PyV, as they are to JC and 
BK viruses (13–15). Results from previous reports suggest 
a similar frequency of both KIPyV and WUPyV infections 
being found in respiratory specimens, ranging from 1% to 
3%. In contrast, in our series, we found a likely difference 
between the prevalence of KIPyV (8%) and WUPyV (1%), 
which suggests that the replication or reactivation of the 2 
viruses in the respiratory tract may differ between immu￾nocompromised and immunocompetent patients. However, 
this difference requires further investigation, in particular, 
by using similar real-time PCR assays. Notably, a signifi -
cantly higher prevalence of KIPyV infection was found 
among HSCT patients, which suggests that a profound 
T-cell defi ciency may be a factor in facilitating KIPyV 
replication.
As reported in other populations, our patients who 
yielded positive specimens for KIPyV or WUPyV had con￾ditions ranging from a common cold to acute respiratory 
distress that required invasive ventilation. Respiratory co￾infections, observed in other studies, had likely accounted 
for at least some clinical features. In the 7 of our patients in 
whom KIPyV was the sole pathogen detected in the respira￾tory tract, despite comprehensive screening for viruses, bac￾teria, parasites, and fungi, clinical and radiographic patterns 
were varied. Some of the patients had only upper respiratory 
tract infections, notably sinusitis, whereas others had lung 
parenchyma abnormalities as defi ned by computed tomo￾graphic scan imaging. However, due to the retrospective 
nature of the study, and therefore the lack of a control group 
of immunocompromised patients without respiratory symp￾toms, the association of KIPyV infection with the occur￾rence of respiratory disease cannot be stated defi nitively.
In conclusion, the seemingly higher frequency of KIP￾yV shedding in immunocompromised patients (as observed 
with other PyVs) and the detection of KIPyV as a single 
pathogen in respiratory disease (e.g., as cytomegalovirus 
recurrence can lead to pneumonia in immunocompromised 
patients) together support a reactivation hypothesis. Never￾theless, a reinfection hypothesis cannot be excluded due to 
immunocompromised patients’ increased risk of acquiring 
viral infection from exogenous sources 
Controlled prospective studies of KIPyV shedding be￾fore and during immunosuppression will help determine 
the pathogenic role of this virus. The clinical implication of 
KIPyV detection in stools and the mechanisms underlying 
the concomitant presence in gastrointestinal and respira￾tory tracts also deserve further analysis.
