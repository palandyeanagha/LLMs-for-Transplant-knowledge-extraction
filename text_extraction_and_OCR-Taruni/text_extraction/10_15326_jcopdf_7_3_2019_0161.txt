Non-Invasive Assessment and Management of Liver Involvement 
in Adults With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
Karim Hamesch, MD1,2 Pavel Strnad, MD1,2
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a systemic disorder affecting mainly the lung and the liver and is caused 
by mutations in SERPINA1, the AAT gene. A homozygous “Pi*Z” mutation (Pi*ZZ genotype) may cause liver 
fibrosis on its own independently of pulmonary AATD manifestation, while heterozygous Pi*Z carriage (Pi*MZ 
genotype) is considered a strong risk factor for development of liver cirrhosis in patients with concomitant liver 
disease such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease. In Pi*ZZ homozygotes, liver disease constitutes the 
second leading cause of death and is highly heterogeneous. About 35% of Pi*ZZ individuals display significant 
liver fibrosis on biopsy (i.e., fibrosis stage ≥ 2 on scale 0–4). Among non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis 
assessment, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) has 
been most widely evaluated. Based on these data, Pi*ZZ adults have 20x increased odds of developing advanced 
liver fibrosis (i.e., fibrosis stage ≥ 3) than adults without AAT mutation. Risk factors for accelerated fibrosis 
progression are male sex, age ≥ 50 years, alcohol misuse, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome. 
Unlike VCTE, other ultrasound- and magnetic resonance-based elastography methods have been assessed in 
small cohorts of Pi*ZZ individuals and remain to be comprehensively validated. Among blood-based fibrosis 
tests, AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) correlates moderately with histologic fibrosis stage and LSM. Given 
APRI’s wide availability, it can be used for risk stratification as an adjunct to LSM or when LSM is not at hand. 
Despite recent efforts, AATD-related liver disease, especially for genotypes other than Pi*ZZ, remains greatly 
understudied. AATD individuals should be offered liver biochemistry, liver ultrasound, and non-invasive 
fibrosis assessment at the time of diagnosis to detect potential complications and for proper risk stratification. 
If signs of AATD-related liver disease occur (i.e., pathologic fibrosis test or repeatedly elevated liver enzymes), 
patients should be referred to a health care center specialized in AATD-related liver disease and be screened for 
potentially treatable comorbidities. To exclude the latter, they may need a liver biopsy. Moreover, every health 
care provider of an AATD individual should be aware of the potential liver manifestation, counsel their patient 
on modifiable hepatic risk factors, and offer them regular liver check-ups.

Chronic liver disease of any etiology may result in 
liver scarring (liver fibrosis) as the uniform response 
to ongoing liver damage. Cirrhosis is the end-stage 
of such a process.1 Mechanistically, the persistent 
hepatic insult leads to loss of hepatocytes and release 
of proinflammatory mediators that result in chronic 
inflammation and activation of hepatic stellate cells.2
The latter are transformed into myofibroblasts and 
represent major producers of extracellular matrix.2
Importantly, the presence of liver fibrosis, but not 
other histological features such as liver steatosis 
(fatty liver) or chronic inflammation, is associated 
with increased hepatic morbidity and mortality.3,4
Because of that, a proper assessment of liver fibrosis is 
essential to understand the severity of liver disease as 
well as the prognosis in order to guide further clinical 
management.5
Patients with chronic hepatitis or early liver 
fibrosis are usually asymptomatic or present with 
unspecific symptoms, hence, they typically remain 
undiagnosed for many years. This is facilitated by 
the fact, that detailed medical history and physical 
examination are often not sufficient for detecting 
advanced liver fibrosis.6 Indeed, patients with fibrosis 
or even cirrhosis may present with normal serum liver 
enzymes.6 While patients with early stages of so-called 
compensated cirrhosis might still be asymptomatic,

Its Consequences?

their decompensation is of great clinical relevance 
since it may lead to multiple life-threatening sequelae. 
Notably, the diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis 
results in a 4.7x increased risk of death compared to 
the general population while decompensated cirrhosis 
is associated with a nearly 10x higher risk.7 The 
average life expectancy of patients with compensated 
cirrhosis is 10 to 13 years, but drops to 2 years when a 
decompensation occurs.8 As a consequence, cirrhosis 
is the 13th leading cause of death globally.1 Moreover, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, which almost exclusively 
occurs in the cirrhotic liver, is the 4th leading cause 
of cancer-related death and its incidence continues to 
grow.9
The main complications seen in individuals with 
decompensated cirrhosis are typically related to an 
elevated blood pressure in the portal venous system.1,10
This can result in ascites, esophageal varices, 
hepatorenal syndrome, and/or hepatic encephalopathy. 
While ascites may be refractory and greatly restrict 
life quality, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may be 
fatal due to progression to multi-organ failure if not 
treated early. Esophageal varices may result in severe 
bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome in persistent 
renal failure, both reducing life expectancy. Finally, 
hepatic encephalopathy may be highly debilitating. 
Additional organs such as the lungs (portopulmonary 
hypertension or hepatopulmonary syndrome) or the 
heart (cirrhotic cardiomyopathy) can also become 
affected due to cirrhosis and the resulting alterations. 
The presented diagnostic challenges as well as 
the deadly consequences of cirrhosis, especially if 
diagnosed at the late stage when a patient becomes 
symptomatic, highlight the importance of detecting 
liver fibrosis as early as possible to prevent further 
progression and/or to discuss the possibility of liver 
transplantation. This is particularly true in conditions 
known to associate with liver involvement such as 
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
For decades, liver biopsy was the key diagnostic 
procedure in hepatology and was used to evaluate 
the cause and stage of liver disease. Consequently, it 
was performed to facilitate the treatment decisions 
and to determine the prognosis.5 While biopsy is still 
considered the gold standard, the clinical approach 
to patients with chronic liver disease has undergone 
How to Assess Liver Fibrosis?

a transformation with an increased use of non￾invasive tools to assess the extent of liver fibrosis.5
Notwithstanding its importance to assess the nature 
of a distinct liver disease,11 liver biopsy has several 
disadvantages that limit its use as a first-line tool 
to assess the stage of fibrosis. A major concern is its 
invasiveness with complications such as pain, bleeding, 
injury to the bile ducts, infection, or rarely, even death.5
Other important issues are the so-called sampling 
bias arising from the fact that the disease is often not 
uniformly distributed throughout the liver12-14 and 
an observer bias caused by the subjective assessment 
of pathologists regarding both severity and etiology 
of disease.12 Additionally, sampling size is not well 
standardized and may greatly affect the pathologist’s 
interpretation.15 Therefore, a single biopsy might 
have limited predictive value14 and the necessity to 
perform serial biopsies to confirm the etiology and 
to monitor the course of disease further potentiates 
the risk of complications. Because of all of these 
issues, liver biopsy constitutes a significant burden 
for the health care system (i.e., the need of an expert 
gastroenterologist [or radiologist] and pathologist 
as well as the required periprocedural monitoring) 
and the patient (i.e., inability to work for a significant 
amount time). 
In the past 3 decades, several non-invasive tools 
for assessing liver fibrosis have been developed and 
validated for use in the clinical routine. While these 
methods typically cannot accurately differentiate the 
stages of fibrosis, they are useful in ruling-out the 
presence of clinically significant liver fibrosis (i.e., 
fibrosis stage of 2 or higher on a 0–4 scale) and in 
ruling-in the presence of advanced liver fibrosis 
(i.e., fibrosis stage of 3 or 4).16 From the less to the 
more technically complicated alternatives, these 
non-invasive fibrosis tests include: blood-based 
tests, ultrasound-based elastography, and magnetic￾resonance-based elastography (Table 1).5,17
Blood tests include the ubiquitously available 
indirect tests, that are based on routine laboratory 
parameters (e.g., AST-to-platelet ratio index[APRI]) 
and fibrosis-4 [FIB4]) as well as the direct tests, using 
more sophisticated parameters and protected formulas 
(e.g., enhanced liver fibrosis [ELF]®, HepaScore®, and 
FibroTest®).18 The indirect blood tests generally 
reflect the amount of liver injury and/or the alterations 
occurring during progressive liver scaring and 
thereby mirror the extent of disease. For instance, 
thrombocytopenia is regarded as the earliest indicator 
of cirrhosis among routine blood tests, capturing 
multiple processes such as diminished liver function 
(reduced thrombopoietin production) and portal 
hypertension (splenic blood sequestration).5,6,19
However, some tests depend on the etiology of chronic 
liver disease such as the “non-alcoholic liver disease 
(NAFLD) fibrosis score” that includes the body mass 
index (BMI) and the presence of diabetes mellitus. 
Direct blood tests try to circumvent the low specificity 
of parameters employed in indirect test scores and 
instead of that, take advantage of parameters of 
fibrogenesis and/or fibrinolysis. However, even this 
more direct approach may lead to false positive/
negative results. Moreover, these assays are less widely 
available and costlier than indirect tests.5,18
Since conventional liver imaging fails to reliably 
detect early stages of liver fibrosis, elastographic 
methods measuring the elasticity of the liver tissue 
emerged as tools to fill this diagnostic gap. These take 
advantage of a shear wave, that is sent from the probe 
through the chest wall into the liver. Subsequently, 
the velocity of wave propagation is evaluated by a 
receiver in the probe. Given that the velocity is related 
to the elasticity of the tissues, it is converted into a 
measurement of liver stiffness.5,17 In most entities of 
chronic liver disease, liver stiffness robustly correlates 
with the extent of liver fibrosis.5,17 Likely because 
of that, liver stiffness is incrementally predictive of 
adverse outcomes of chronic liver disease.5,20,21 For 
the various entities, specific liver stiffness cut-offs 
for ruling-out significant liver fibrosis and ruling-in 
cirrhosis have been proposed.17 However, the values 
of liver stiffness (i.e., kPa or m/s) determined by 
different elastographic tools are not interchangeable. 
Hence, cut-offs have still to be seen in the context 
of the underlying etiology and the used method and 
still carry a certain degree of uncertainty. However, as 
elastography is increasingly used as a first line tool 
to assess the extent of liver fibrosis, some authors 
proposed etiology-unspecific cut-offs.17
When used properly, elastography is excellent in 
ruling-out significant liver fibrosis (i.e., excellent 
negative likelihood ratios for F ≤ 1) and ruling￾in advanced liver fibrosis (i.e., excellent positive 
likelihood ratios for F ≥ 3). However, several potential 
confounders must be considered when elevated liver 
stiffness values are measured to make sure that these 
really reflect an advanced scaring. Among others,

non-fasting (i.e., the postprandially increased blood 
flow through the liver), severe inflammation (i.e., liver 
enzymes > 5x the upper limit of normal), or passive 
liver congestion (i.e., heart failure) may result in high 
stiffness values that potentially overestimate the 
amount of liver fibrosis.5,17,22
The most widely available ultrasound-based 
elastography methods are: vibration-controlled 
transient elastography (VCTE; FibroScan®; 
Echosens, France), acoustic radiation force impulse 
imaging (ARFI; Siemens, Germany), and 2D-shear 
wave elastography (2D-SWE; offered by different 
companies [e.g. ,Toshiba, Japan]).17 All methods are 
used to measure liver stiffness of the right liver lobe 
and the measurement is performed via an intercostal 
access. Of these methods, VCTE is the most widely 
used one and is backed up by the largest amount of 
scientific evidence.5,17,23 In addition, VCTE offers a 
simultaneous measurement of controlled attenuation 
parameter (CAP), that is used as a surrogate of hepatic 
steatosis.24 On the other hand, ARFI and 2D-SWE 
allow a simultaneous visualization of the area in which 
liver stiffness is measured, whereas VTCE is performed 
in a “blind” manner.17
Magnetic-resonance-based elastography (MRE) 
is another attractive method for assessment of liver 
stiffness. It is regarded to be at least equivalent to 
VCTE in distinguishing between advanced and non￾advanced liver fibrosis.25,26 Similar to VCTE, it can 
also quantify hepatic steatosis using proton density 
fat fraction (PDFF). Notably, MRE appears to perform 
better than VCTE in patients with severe obesity.5
Another advantage of MRE is the fact that it analyzes 
the liver as a whole while all ultrasound-based 
elastography methods assess only a limited region 
of the liver. Still, basically the same confounders of 
liver stiffness measurement apply to MRE as to the 
ultrasound-based techniques. In conclusion, MRE is 
equal or possibly even superior to VCTE, especially in 
difficult cases, but is less widely available and remains 
to be standardized between health care centers and 
different vendors.27
As non-invasive risk stratification is emerging as 
the new standard of initial liver disease evaluation, 
risk assessment has shifted from histological fibrosis 
staging to the dichotomization of fibrosis as advanced 
versus non-advanced.3-5 Thus, the current strategy 
is to triage the patients into different risk categories. 
Consequently, liver biopsy is employed for individuals 
with inconclusive non-invasive results as well as for 
obtaining additional diagnostic clues. This approach 
greatly reduced the number of performed liver biopsies. 
A commonly used strategy is to use an indirect blood￾based test (e.g., APRI or FIB-4) and an elastographic 
method (e.g., VCTE).5 If both tests concordantly 
indicate that advanced liver fibrosis is not present, 
a more or less stringent follow-up is recommended. 
If both tests concordantly indicate the presence of 
advanced liver fibrosis, the patient should be managed 
accordingly (e.g., monitoring for complications of 
cirrhosis). If both tests are discordant (and if potential 
confounders of both blood-based and elastography-

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is one of the 
most common, potentially lethal genetic diseases 
worldwide. While over 100 mutations of the SERPINA1
gene are known, the “Pi*Z” variant (Glu342Lys) is the 
most relevant mutation. Heterozygous Pi*Z carriage 
is termed as “Pi*MZ” genotype and occurs in about 
1:30 whites. Homozygosity of the Pi*Z variant is 
termed as the “Pi*ZZ” genotype and is seen in about 
1:3000 whites. AATD is a multi-systemic disease 
mainly affecting the lungs (due to deficiency of AAT 
in the circulation) and the liver (due to intrahepatic 
accumulation of misfolded AAT).28-30 While AATD￾related lung disease is the most common disease 
manifestation, liver disease is the second most common 
organ involvement. It displays a biphasic pattern in 
that it typically occurs either in early childhood or 
late adulthood.31 Notably, the relative proportion of 
AATD-related liver disease is higher in never-smokers 
compared to smokers.32,33 An increasing prevalence 
of AATD-related liver disease is to be expected due 
to: (1) the decreasing proportion of smokers in the 
population and consequently a decreasing proportion 
of AATD-related lung disease; (2) the current epidemic 
of obesity that constitutes an important co-factor 
in liver disease development;34,35 (3) the increased 
awareness of AATD-related liver disease among 
patients and physicians; and (4) the growing number

based tests had previously been excluded), liver biopsy 
should be discussed, especially if it affects further 
management.
Taken together, non-invasive measures of liver 
fibrosis assessment are increasingly available, have 
no/minimal procedure-related risks and are less costly 
than biopsy. Therefore, they are well suited for a high￾throughput monitoring of liver disease progression. 
This is particularly relevant given the high burden of 
NAFLD affecting up to 30% of the population. Despite 
the reduced need for liver biopsy, histology remains 
an important tool in specific indications, such as in 
individuals with an inconclusive result of non-invasive 
assessment or in patients, where further information 
about the etiology and/or activity of liver injury are 
needed.
of therapeutic studies targeting the liver.36
While diagnosis of adult liver disease in general 
is difficult, early diagnosis of liver involvement 
in patients with AATD – whether AATD itself is 
diagnosed or not – is particularly challenging.18 A 
major reason is that in homozygous Pi*ZZ adults, 
liver enzymes are frequently not elevated despite 
significant liver fibrosis.37,38 Additionally, likely due 
to low awareness about the importance of liver disease 
burden, liver enzymes are not determined regularly.38
To change that, several recent studies evaluated the 
liver phenotype of Pi*ZZ individuals. First, a biopsy 
study evaluated the amount of liver fibrosis in 94 non￾cirrhotic Pi*ZZ individuals and observed significant 
liver fibrosis in 35% of them.39 This endeavor also 
validated the usefulness of several blood- and 
elastography-based fibrosis scores to predict the extent 
of histological liver fibrosis.39 APRI and FIB-4 both 
predicted the presence of clinically significant fibrosis 
on liver histology (i.e., fibrosis stage of at least 2 on 
a 0–4 METAVIR scale). The areas under the receiver 
operating curve (AUROC) were 0.69 and 0.66 for APRI 
and FIB-4, respectively. VCTE was also validated in this 
cohort and had an AUROC of 0.70 for significant liver 
fibrosis. Interestingly, the gamma-glutamyl transferase 
(GGT) test was numerically better for recognizing 
the presence of significant fibrosis (i.e., F ≥ 2) with 
an AUROC of 0.77 compared to indirect blood tests 
as well as VCTE. However, VCTE was better than all 
blood-based parameters to distinguish advanced liver 
fibrosis (i.e., F ≥ 3 compared to F ≤ 2; AUROC 0.92) and 
this finding was confirmed in an independent study 
assessing Pi*ZZ adults with advanced liver fibrosis.40
This is reminiscent of the situation in other chronic 
liver diseases as liver stiffness is known to be useful to 
detect advanced liver fibrosis but is less well suited to 
demarcate mild or significant liver fibrosis stages (i.e., 
F ≤ 2).17
VCTE was also used in a large multinational cohort 
comprising 554 Pi*ZZ adults and proved to be an 
easy-to-use tool which was cross-validated against 
the aforementioned APRI score (indirect blood test) as 
well as the patented HepaScore (direct blood test). This 
multinational effort confirmed the high prevalence 
of significant liver fibrosis in Pi*ZZ individuals. 
Depending on the method, significant fibrosis was seen 
in 20%-36% of them and advanced liver fibrosis was 
9–20x more frequent in Pi*ZZ individuals compared to 
individuals without AAT mutation.38 These data are

in line with other observations. In particular, Pi*ZZ 
individuals are about 20x more likely to require liver 
transplantation than non-carriers (Table 2).38,41,42
The above described, VCTE-based study38 offers 
an unprecedented insight into a large population of 
Pi*ZZ individuals and allows an assessment of disease 
modifying factors. This is particularly important, since 
Pi*ZZ-related liver disease is highly heterogeneous.43
This heterogeneity is likely due to both additional 
genetic factors as well as second hits, that presumably 
result in accelerated liver fibrogenesis. While these 
modifiers remain largely unknown, male sex, age ≥
50 years, obesity, and presence of diabetes and/or 
metabolic syndrome play an important role.38,39,43,44
While alcohol misuse – as one of the leading causes 
of liver disease worldwide – was excluded from studies 
with Pi*ZZ adults, it is likely that alcohol misuse is 
also a relevant risk factor for liver fibrogenesis. This is 
also supported by the strong impact of heterozygous 
Pi*Z carriage on cirrhosis development in adults 
with alcohol misuse.45 Notably, the above described 
parameters have all been associated with accelerated 
liver disease progression in other liver disorders. 
Importantly, the severity of lung and liver disease do 
not seem to correlate, which is well in line with the fact 
that they are pathomechanistically different.38
Several smaller studies tested other modalities 
of non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment in Pi*ZZ 
adults: 2 studies employed MRE46,47 with one of 
them validating its usefulness in a small cohort of 11
biopsied Pi*ZZ adults.43 This very limited evidence 
suggests that MRE might be suitable to exclude 
the presence of significant liver fibrosis. However, 
the current data need to be confirmed in larger 
investigations. While MRE has the advantage of 
assessing the whole liver with high accuracy, its main 
disadvantage is the low availability and the high costs 
which limits its applicability for the routine evaluation 
of Pi*ZZ individuals. 
Two other studies evaluated other ultrasound-based 
elastography methods (ARFI47,48 and 2D-SWE47). 
However, ARFI and 2D-SWE approaches were not 
validated against liver histology and these methods 
are, even for other disease entities, not as well￾validated as VCTE.17 Notwithstanding this limitation, 
in a small Pi*ZZ cohort, ARFI, 2D-SWE, and MRE 
correlated strongly with each other.47 Therefore, ARFI, 
and 2D-SWE might be useful in conjunction with a 
blood-based fibrosis score to assess whether advanced 
liver fibrosis is present. As for other liver diseases,5 the

combination of a blood-based fibrosis test (with APRI 
being the most validated one) and an elastography 
method (with VCTE being the most established one) 
offers the best, currently available diagnostic accuracy 
and inconclusive results should foster liver biopsy. A 
combination of different methods might be especially 
helpful for patients with intermediate liver stiffness 
values (i.e., 5-7 kPa). 
In addition to liver fibrosis assessment, the recently 
published studies revealed other interesting features 
of Pi*ZZ-related liver disease. For example, 44%
of Pi*ZZ individuals displayed histological liver 
steatosis39 and these data meshed well with non￾invasive evaluations using CAP as a surrogate of liver 
steatosis.24 In particular, CAP ≥ 280 dB/m, suggesting 
severe steatosis (grade 3), was detected in 39% of 
Pi*ZZ homozygotes versus 31% of non-carriers while 
CAP ≥ 248 dB/m, suggesting the presence of steatosis 
grade ≥ 1, was present in 61% of Pi*ZZ individuals.38
Another small study using CAP detected steatosis 
grade ≥ 1 in 65% of Pi*ZZ/Pi*SZ adults and grade ≥
2 in 52% of individuals.49 However, the accuracy of 
CAP for predicting histological steatosis has not been 
histologically validated in AATD yet. As a potential 
underlying mechanism, Pi*ZZ individuals displayed 
lower serum triglyceride, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations than Pi*Z non-carriers which points 
to the hypothesis that Pi*ZZ individuals may have 
impaired hepatic lipid secretion. These findings were 
supported by the observations in transgenic mice 
overexpressing the Pi*Z mutation, that also harboured 
mild liver steatosis.38
While the above described studies allowed a solid 
insight into the likelihood of Pi*ZZ individuals to suffer 
from cirrhosis, their risk to develop hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) has not been systematically 
analyzed. While early studies suggested a high risk, 
several others imply a lower likelihood and suggest 
that HCC develops almost exclusively in cirrhotic 
Pi*ZZ individuals.50,51 Therefore, additional studies 
are needed to clarify this discrepancy. Likewise, 
longitudinal studies assessing the exact risk of hepatic 
decompensation in Pi*ZZ adults need to be performed. 
These studies are crucial for development of a hepatic 
surveillance plan. 
In contrast to the Pi*ZZ genotype that is disease￾causing and therefore may lead to cirrhosis 
development on its own, heterozygous Pi*Z carriage 
(Pi*MZ genotype) is considered disease-modifying. 
With regard to the latter, Pi*MZ individuals have an 
increased risk of developing cirrhosis when chronic 
liver injury of another etiology co-exists. This has 
been particularly convincingly demonstrated in 
children with cystic fibrosis-related liver disease52
as well as in adults with NAFLD and alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (ALD).51,45 In all of these studies, 
heterozygous Pi*Z carriage conferred a strong risk for 
development of cirrhosis with an odds ratio as high 
as 5–7. Moreover, in a large genome-wide association 
study, the Pi*Z variant was the single-nucleotide 
polymorphism conferring the strongest odds ratio to 
develop ALD-/NAFLD-related cirrhosis.51 Notably, 
the heterozygous Pi*Z presence may not only affect 
the risk to suffer from cirrhosis, but may also lead to 
faster hepatic decompensation53 and thereby result in 
increased morbidity and mortality. While the risk of de 
novo HCC development in Pi*MZ heterozygotes has 
not been systematically studied,50 Pi*MZ adults with 
cirrhosis due to ALD or NAFLD do not seem to have 
an increased HCC risk compared to cirrhosis patients 
without Pi*Z carriage.51 As heterozygous Pi*Z carriage 
is quite common (2%–4% of the white population) it 
appears useful to screen for Pi*Z carriage in patients 
with chronic liver disease and inform them about 
their risk of rapid progression (e.g., more pronounced 
portal hypertension49) as well as to counsel them to 
avoid hepatologic risk factors (e.g., alcohol misuse, 
obesity, and metabolic syndrome). Such a genotyping 
might also be useful to prioritize them in listing 
for liver transplantation.53 Finally, a recent study 
investigating the natural history of liver disease in 
Pi*MZ individuals without concomitant liver disease 
showed that heterozygous Pi*Z carriage is not only 
a disease modifier of cirrhosis development, but also 
associated with a distinct liver phenotype.54
In conclusion, the available evidence demonstrates 
that Pi*ZZ homozygotes are 10–20x more likely 
to develop advanced liver fibrosis and that they 
more commonly have liver steatosis with metabolic 
alterations. Heterozygous Pi*Z carriage (Pi*MZ 
genotype) is a strong risk factor for cirrhosis 
development, especially in the context of alcoholic 
misuse or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Further 
work is needed to determine the hepatic consequences 
of less prominent AAT variants including the

transplantation. Cirrhotics should be also subjected to 
ultrasound-based HCC surveillance every 6 months 
and screened for the potential presence of esophageal 
varices. 
Individuals with less advanced liver fibrosis likely 
require a less stringent monitoring and the exact 
frequency of monitoring should be determined 
individually, based on the patient genotype, 
preferences, expected amount of fibrosis, as well as 
the presumed disease activity. The clinical context 
including age, sex, presence of comorbidities (such 
as obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, 
or alcohol misuse) should also be taken into 
consideration. Moreover, AATD individuals should 
be counseled about the established risk factors and to 
maintain an active, healthy lifestyle, normal BMI, and 
to abstain from risky alcohol consumption. Individuals 
with recurrently elevated liver enzymes should be 
screened for presence of comorbidities and once these 
are excluded, suggested to perform liver biopsy to 
rule-out presence of concomitant liver disease.
As no evidence-based hepatologic care plan exists, it 
is recommended to refer Pi*ZZ individuals– especially 
those with signs of liver disease–to a health care center 
specializing in AATD-related liver disease. Moreover, 
these centers can evaluate whether an individual 
is suitable for one of the therapeutic trials that are 
currently being initiated. In our center, we recommend 
to control liver enzymes at least every 6–12 months and 
to perform an assessment of liver fibrosis every 1–2
years. Given that the risk of HCC has not been clearly 
determined, we tend to perform liver ultrasounds once 
a year in non-cirrhotic individuals. (Figure 1)

For the clinical routine, there are 3 major questions: 
• Which AATD individuals should be assessed for 
 the presence of liver disease?
• How should these individuals be monitored?
• How should AATD patients with signs of liver
 disease be managed?
While longitudinal studies systematically assessing 
the occurrence of liver disease in Pi*ZZ and Pi*MZ 
adults are missing, the current data suggests that health 
care providers should be aware of the relatively high 
risk of liver disease in these individuals and to, at least, 
determine serum liver enzymes regularly (i.e., alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, GGT, 
alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin). Surprisingly, 
in a large multinational cohort of 554 adult Pi*ZZ 
homozygotes, 55% did not receive regular liver 
monitoring by serial measurements of liver enzymes,38
despite the fact that this surveillance can be offered 
easily and at low cost. 
The hepatologic monitoring of Pi*ZZ adults is 
particularly challenging because of the striking 
heterogeneity of liver disease and because most Pi*ZZ 
individuals display normal serum liver enzymes and in 
spite of that, some of them may already have advanced 
liver fibrosis.38,39 We recommend at least an initial, 
non-invasive assessment of liver disease in Pi*ZZ 
individuals with elastography as well as with liver 
ultrasound. Alternatively, a non-invasive evaluation 
with an indirect fibrosis test can be carried out and 
individuals with intermediate or higher risk should be 
further assessed.
While there is no evidence-based hepatologic care 
plan for individuals with AATD-related liver fibrosis 
yet, based on the above mentioned findings,38,39 we 
recommend to approach these individuals in the same 
manner as patients with other liver disease entities. 
As detailed above, liver diseases should be evaluated 
by blood-based parameters, ultrasonography, and an 
invasive or non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis 
and the management should depend on the determined 
amount of fibrosis. In particular, individuals with 
end-stage liver disease and preserved lung function 
constitute ideal candidates for liver transplantation55
and patients with both Pi*ZZ-related lung and liver 
disease can be evaluated for combined lung and liver
