Sarcopenia in HCC Patients
Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 21 (11), 3285-3290 
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a dreadful 
complication of the liver cirrhosis that is associated 
with short survival. In men, HCC is the fifth malignancy 
meanwhile in the women, it is the eighth malignancy 
(Elshaarawy et al., 2019).
The generalized loss of both the function and the mass 
of muscles, is called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia may be due to 
aging or secondary to medical disease like liver cirrhosis 
(Bunchorntavakul and Reddy, 2020). 
There are multiple factors that cause malnutrition and 
subsequent sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Decreased 
nutrient intake is common owing to anorexia, protein 
restriction, disturbed conscious state and taste change. 
The energy metabolism is altered due to hypercatabolic 
state and altered metabolism for carbohydrates, proteins, 
and fat. Maldigestion is common. Another factor is 
repeated fasting with bleeding, encephalopathy and before 
procedures (Dasarathy and Merli, 2016; Bunchorntavakul 
and Reddy, 2020).
There are various methods for the diagnosis of 
Abstract
Objective: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a dreadful complication of liver cirrhosis. Aim was to study the 
effect of sarcopenia on the survival in patients with HCC. Methods: we included 262 patients and were followed 
up for 12 months. Sarcopenia was calculated by skeletal muscle index (SMI). Sarcopenia was defined by SMI ≤39 
cm2
/m2
 for women and ≤50 cm2
/m2
 for men. Results: patients with sarcopenia (n= 113, 43.1%) were older, mainly 
males, Child-Pugh class B and smokers. Patients with sarcopenia had lower survival than those without (10.09 vs. 
11.72 months). Survival was also lower in Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage C than B and A (9.02 vs. 11.21 vs. 11.89 
months). Age and sarcopenia were hazardous of mortality (p<0.05). There was statistically significant difference of 
serial SMI in patients without baseline sarcopenia unlike patients with baseline sarcopenia. On follow up patients 
with sarcopenia had higher incidence of ascites (45% vs. 20.4%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (21.7% vs. 11.6%), 
hepatic encephalopathy (28% vs. 11.5%) and bleeding (22.9% vs. 12.7%). Totally patients with sarcopenia had higher 
incidence of progressive HCC (39% vs. 25.5%). Conclusion: Sarcopenia is associated with lack of response to therapy, 
liver decompensation and higher mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

sarcopenia such as the hand grip, anthropometry, 
bioelectrical impedance, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 
and computerized tomography (CT). In CT sarcopenia 
is diagnosed by measuring the skeletal muscle cross 
sectional at the third lumbar vertebra normalized to the 
height (Ebadi and Montano-Loza).
Sarcopenia is an independent predictor of increased 
care cost, hepatic encephalopathy, waitlist mortality, 
longer hospital stay and post-liver transplantation 
mortality (Ebadi and Montano-Loza; Sinclair et al., 2016).
There are various consequences of malnutrition and 
sarcopenia in pateints with cirrhosis. There is increased 
incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and decreased 
quality of life. Bacterial complications are common 
with shortened survival. The decreased physical activity 
predisposes to peri or post-operative complications. HCC 
patients with sarcopenia suffer from increased treatment 
induced complications and decreased overall survival. 
Sarcopenia affects liver transplantation badly where 
there is increased waitlist mortality, peri/post-operative 
mortality with decreased survival (Dasarathy and Merli, 
2016; Bunchorntavakul and Reddy, 2020). A recent

review article mentioned the role of sarcopenia with all 
the modalities of HCC treatment and the effect on the 
survival (Marasco et al., 2020).
The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 
sarcopenia on the survival in patients with HCC.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Methods
This study included 262 patients diagnosed to have 
HCC recently within 4 weeks without any management 
as regards the focal lesions. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
was diagnosed by triphasic CT in which the focal lesion 
showed arterial enhancement followed by portal and 
venous washout (European Association for the Study 
of the et al.). These patients were Barcelona clinic liver 
cancer (BCLC) stage A through C as patients with BCLC 
D were excluded from the beginning and those who were 
willing for liver transplantation.
All the patients underwent complete history taking and 
physical examination. The following investigations were 
done: liver function tests, kidney function tests, complete 
blood picture, INR and alfa-fetoprotein. The patients were 
followed up for 12 months.
Sarcopenia was diagnosed radiologically by the 
calculation of the skeletal muscle index (SMI). The 
SMI was defined as the cross-sectional area (cm2
) of 
the muscles measured by CT at level of the third lumbar 
vertebrate that was normalized to the height of the patient. 
Sarcopenia was defined by SMI ≤39 cm2
/m2
 for women 
and ≤50 cm2
/m2
 for men (Carey et al., 2017).
Sarcopenia was classified morphologically using 
CT into 5 grades; 0 through 4 where grade 3 and 4 
are advanced stages (Inokuchi et al., 2001). These 
morphological changes are the mean of the right and the 
left short to long axis of the psoas muscle (Inokuchi et 
al., 2001). 
Sarcopenia was assessed at inclusion (baseline) then 
after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At these time points patients 
were assessed also as regard the response to management 
and the occurrence of liver decompensation (ascites, 
hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
and upper gastrointestinal bleeding).
The management of the hepatocellular carcinoma 
was determined by the decision of the multidisciplinary 
HCC team which included hepatologist, radiologist 
and a hepatobiliary surgeon. The management included 
liver resection, radiofrequency ablation, microwave 
ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, trans-arterial 
chemoembolization, oral sorafenib and the best supportive 
care.
This study was conducted in National Liver Institute 
hospitals, Menoufia University, Egypt. Patients were 
recruited from the outpatient hepatocellular carcinoma 
clinic. Approval from the institutional review board was 
obtained and the patients signed an informed signed 
consent before enrollment.
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean ±standard deviation for 
normally distributed data and number (column percentage) 
for the categorical data. All p-values are 2 tailed 
where values <0.05 considered statistically significant. 
Comparisons between two groups were performed using 
the Student’s t-test for normally distributed. CHI-squared 
test (χ2
) and Fisher exact test for categorical data analysis. 
Repeated measure ANOVA or Friedman test was used for 
testing serial changing variables. The survival as assessed 
by Kaplan-Meier survival. Comparison of survival curves 
was done by Logrank test. The Cox proportional-hazards 
regression was used to detect the predictors of mortality. 
Data were statistically analyzed using IBM® SPSS® 
Statistics® version 21 for Windows. 
Results
The comparison of the patients with and without 
sarcopenia is shown in Table 1. Patients with baseline 
sarcopenia (n= 113, 43.1%) were older, having lower body 
mass index and were being less categorized as BCLC 
A than non-sarcopenic patients. Sarcopenia was more 
common in the males compared to females. The presence 
of sarcopenia was not affected by the etiology of the liver 
disease. The CTP class B and smoking were common in

months). The survival was also lower in BCLC C than 
BCLC B and A (9.02 vs. 11.21 vs. 11.89 months).
The cox regression analysis revealed the following 
covariate that are associated with mortality (p<0.05); age 
(hazard ratio; 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.08), BMI (hazard 
ratio; 0.71, 95% CI: 0.63 - 0.79), serum bilirubin (hazard 
ratio; 2.43, 95% CI: 1.66 - 3.54), serum albumin (hazard 
ratio; 0.25, 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.43), CTP B (hazard ratio; 
4.73, 95% CI: 2.78 - 8.06), BCLC B (hazard ratio; 4.76, 
95% CI: 1.68 - 13.42), BCLC C (hazard ratio; 23.98, 95% 
CI: 8.51 - 67.57) and sarcopenia (hazard ratio; 6.55, 95% 
CI: 3.71 - 11.58).
Longitudinal follow up of patients with and without 
sarcopenia
On follow up of patients with and without baseline 
sarcopenia after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months we found that the 
percentages of grade 2 and 3 sarcopenia were higher in 
patients with sarcopenia.
Patients with sarcopenia (Table 2 and Figure 1) 
had lower survival than those without (10.09 vs. 11.72

points (Table 1 and Figure 2).
On tracing the SMI (Figure 3) from the baseline 
through 1, 3, 6 and 12 months there was statistically 
significant difference (p =0.001) of the mean SMI in 
patients without baseline sarcopenia. The baseline value 
(cm2
/m2
) was statistically higher than the 1, 3, 6 and 12 
months (52.78 ±8.32 vs. 51.80 ±8.41 vs. 50.34 ±8.12 
vs. 49.54 ±8.28 vs. 49.28 ±8.29; p =0.001). On pairwise 
comparison of the different time points there was a 
statistically significant difference (p=0.001) between all 
of them except the value at 6 and 12 months which were 
comparable (p >0.005).
In patients with baseline sarcopenia, there was no 
statistically significant difference between the baseline 
and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months (44.12 ±5.34 vs. 43.85 ±5.77

43.52 ±5.31) and (49.28 ±8.29 vs. 45.72 ±13.23).
Relationship between sarcopenia and the liver 
decompensation
Patients with baseline sarcopenia had a statistically (p 
=0.01) higher percentage of ascites development in the 
first (34.5% vs. 12.1%), third (46% vs. 23.5%) and the 
sixth months (58.3% vs. 22.6%). On the end of the study 
as shown in Figure 4; the percentage was comparable 
(39% vs. 23.9%; p=0.32).
Patients with baseline sarcopenia had a statistically 
(p =0.01) higher percentage of spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis in the first (10.9%vs. 0.7%), third (39.9% vs. 
12.8%) and the sixth months (32.4% vs. 6.1%). On the

month (24.1% vs. 16.4%; p=0.130).
Totally patients with sarcopenia compared to those 
without had higher (p =0.001) percentage of ascites (45% 
vs. 20.4%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (21.7% vs. 
11.6%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (22.9% vs. 12.7%) 
and hepatic encephalopathy (28% vs. 11.5%).
Relationship between sarcopenia and response to 
treatment
Patients with baseline sarcopenia compared to those 
without, had higher percentage of progressive HCC 
despite intervention in the first (29.2 vs. 16.1; p=0.023), 
third (40.7 vs. 29.5; p=0.001), sixth (51.4 vs. 30.6; 
p=0.001) and the 12th months (32.1 vs. 25.7; p=0.001).
Totally patients with sarcopenia compared to those 
without had higher (p =0.001) total percentage of 
progressive HCC (39% vs. 25.5%).
Discussion
HCC is an ominous complication of liver cirrhosis. It 
is associated with high mortality (Marasco et al., 2020). 
Recently sarcopenia was found to be a risk factor for 
decreased the overall survival in HCC patients (Levolger 
et al., 2015; Begini et al., 2017; Imai et al., 2017). 
In patients who underwent trans-arterial 
chemoembolization; the presence of baseline sarcopenia 
was associated with decreased overall survival (Loosen et 
al., 2019) unlike other studies who did not found difference 
(Kobayashi et al., 2018; Fujita et al., 2019). A recent study 
reported that the presence of sarcopenia is associated with 
high mortality and does not affect locoregional therapy 
safety (Lanza et al., 2020).
Figure 4. Liver Decompensation Incidence in the Different Time Ppoints of the Study
Harimoto et al., (2013) reported that patients who 
underwent resection with pre-operative sarcopenia had 
statistically lower survival and recurrence-free survival. 
This was confirmed by other studies (Voron et al., 2015; 
Harimoto et al., 2016; Takagi et al., 2016; Hiraoka et al., 
2018; Kobayashi et al., 2019).
Sarcopenia is associated with higher incidence of 
recurrence following surgical resection and radiofrequency 
ablation of HCC (Kamachi et al., 2016).
In the different studies by Hiraoka et al.,(2017), 
Nishikawa et al., (2017) and Takada et al.,(2018) 
conducted on sorafenib treatment in HCC patients; about 
~60% of the patients had sarcopenia. The overall survival 
was significantly less in patients with pretreatment 
sarcopenia.
AFP >100 mg/dL is a predictor of sarcopenia in HCC 
patients who are prepared for liver transplantation (Acosta 
et al., 2019). In the patients who were transplanted beyond 
the Milan, the HCC recurrence was higher in patients with 
pretransplant sarcopenia (Kim et al., 2018).
In our study, patients with sarcopenia were older 
and having advanced BCLC stage. The overall survival 
was less in patients with baseline sarcopenia in accord 
with other studies (Levolger et al., 2015; Begini et al., 
2017; Imai et al., 2017) and in contrast to other studies 
(Kobayashi et al., 2018; Fujita et al., 2019). Moreover, 
the survival was higher in BCLC A patients. 
Patients with baseline sarcopenia had higher incidence 
of liver decompensation e.g. ascites, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding during the study.
Furthermore, the baseline sarcopenia was associated 
with lack of response to intervention and progressive

HCC.
On tracing of the skeletal muscle index, we found 
comparable values at the different time points of the 
study for patient with baseline sarcopenia. In contrast, the 
skeletal muscle index was decreasing from the baseline in 
patients without baseline sarcopenia. It may be due to the 
fact that most treatments are not curative till now for HCC.
In conclusion, Sarcopenia is associated with lack of 
response to therapy, liver decompensation and higher 
mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
