Abstract
BACKGROUND--DDD pacing has been advocated as an effective
treatment for drug refractory obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. This study reports the outcome of pacing in 56
patients with refractory symptoms referred to four tertiary centres.
METHODS--Core data on symptoms, drug burden, and left
ventricular outflow tract gradient were recorded. Patients
underwent a temporary pacing study with optimisation of the
atrioventricular (AV) delay for greatest gradient reduction without
haemodynamic compromise. Patients were assessed after
implantation in terms of changes in symptoms, drug load, and
outflow tract gradient. RESULTS--56 patients underwent pacing
assessment. The mean (SD) left ventricular outflow tract gradient
before pacing was 78 (31) mm Hg. At temporary study the mean
(SD) left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 38 (24) mm Hg with
a median (range) optimised sensed AV delay of 65 (25-125) ms.
Fifty three patients were implanted and followed up for a mean
(SD) of 11 (11) months. The median (range) programmed sensed
AV delay was 60 (31-200) ms. Left ventricular outflow tract
gradient at follow up was 36 (25) mm Hg. Forty four patients had
improved functional class. Although a correlation (r = 0.69) was
shown between acute and chronic left ventricular outflow tract
gradient reduction, there was no correlation between magnitude of
gradient reduction and functional improvement, and no appreciable
change in pharmacological burden. CONCLUSION--This series
confirms symptomatic improvement after DDD pacing in
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There remains, however, a
discrepancy between perceived symptomatic benefit and modest
objective improvement. Furthermore, the optimal outcome has been
achieved only with continued pharmacological treatment. Current
methods of temporary evaluation do not predict functional outcome
which seems to be independent of the magnitude of gradient
reduction.
