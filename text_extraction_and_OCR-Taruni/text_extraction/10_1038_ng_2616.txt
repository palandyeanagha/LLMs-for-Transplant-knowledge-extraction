Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a severe liver disease
of unknown etiology leading to fibrotic destruction of the bile
ducts and ultimately to the need for liver transplantation1–3.
We compared 3,789 PSC cases of European ancestry to 25,079
population controls across 130,422 SNPs genotyped using
the Immunochip4. We identified 12 genome-wide significant
associations outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
complex, 9 of which were new, increasing the number of known
PSC risk loci to 16. Despite comorbidity with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) in 72% of the cases, 6 of the 12 loci
showed significantly stronger association with PSC than with
IBD, suggesting overlapping yet distinct genetic architectures
for these two diseases. We incorporated association statistics
from 7 diseases clinically occurring with PSC in the analysis and
found suggestive evidence for 33 additional pleiotropic PSC
risk loci. Together with network analyses, these findings add
to the genetic risk map of PSC and expand on the relationship
between PSC and other immune-mediated diseases.
The pathogenesis of PSC is poorly understood, and, owing to the 
lack of effective medical therapy, PSC remains a leading indica￾tor for liver transplantation in northern Europe and the United 
States5, despite its relatively low prevalence (1 in 10,000). Affected 
individuals are diagnosed at a median age of 30–40 years and suffer 
from an increased frequency of IBD (60–80%)5,6 and autoimmune 
diseases (25%)7. Conversely, approximately only 5% of individu￾als with IBD develop PSC5,6. Sibling relative risk of 9- to 39-fold 
indicates a strong genetic component to PSC risk8. In addition 
to multiple strong associations within the HLA complex, recent 
association studies have identified genome-wide significant loci at 
1p36 (MMEL1-TNFRSF14), 2q13 (BCL2L11), 2q37 (GPR35), 3p21 
(MST1), 10p15 (IL2RA) and 18q21 (TCF4)9–13.
Several theories have been proposed to explain the development 
of PSC5. The strong HLA associations and the clinical occurrence 
of PSC with immune-mediated diseases suggest that autoimmunity 
has a role in pathogenesis. To further characterize the genetic etio￾logy of PSC, we recruited individuals with PSC throughout Europe 
and North America, more than doubling the number of ascertained 
cases included in previous genetic studies11. We genotyped 196,524 
SNPs in 4,228 PSC cases and 27,077 population controls (Online 
Methods and Supplementary Note) using the Immunochip4,14, 
a targeted genotyping array with dense marker coverage across 186 
known disease loci from 12 immune-mediated diseases. Outside 
these 186 loci, the Immunochip also assays thousands of SNPs of 
intermediate significance from multiple meta-analyses of immune￾mediated diseases.
Dense genotyping of immune-related disease regions 
identifies nine new risk loci for primary sclerosing cholangitis

After quality control (Online Methods), 130,422 SNPs from 3,789 
PSC cases and 25,079 population controls were available for analysis 
(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). We 
imputed a further 80,183 SNPs located in the Immunochip fine-­mapping 
regions using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (Online 
Methods). We performed case-control association tests using a linear 
mixed model as implemented in MMM15 to minimize the effect of popu￾lation stratification and sample relatedness (genomic inflation factor 
λGC = 1.02, estimated using 2,544 ‘null’ SNPs, that is, SNPs located outside 
of known risk loci for immune-mediated diseases; Online Methods).
We identified 12 non-HLA genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10−8) 
susceptibility loci (Table 1), 9 of which were new (Fig. 1). The most 
associated SNP within each locus was a common variant (all risk allele 
frequencies > 0.18) of moderate effect (odds ratios (ORs) between 1.15 
and 1.33) (Table 1). Genotype imputation and stepwise conditional 
regression analyses16 within each locus did not identify additional 
independent genome-wide significant signals, nor did genotype￾genotype or sex-genotype interaction analyses (Online Methods).
For seven of the nine new loci, the most significantly associ￾ated SNP in the locus was the same SNP or was in strong linkage

directly genotyped SNPs, and unfilled triangles represent imputed SNPs (Online Methods). The color of the markers shows LD with the most strongly 
associated SNP. Results are shown for SNPs rs7426056 (a), rs13140464 (b), rs56258221 (c), rs7937682 (d), rs11168249 (e), rs3184504 (f), 
rs1788097 (g), rs60652743 (h) and rs2836883 (i). Because the most strongly associated SNPs in d and e are located outside Immunochip fine￾mapping regions, association results from the discovery panel of the largest PSC genome-wide association study (GWAS) so far12 are shown as unfilled 
circles, and the most associated SNP at each locus is shown as an unfilled diamond (genotyped and imputed HapMap release 22 SNPs; cases overlap 
with those in the current study). Plus and minus signs by the gene symbols refer to the direction of gene transcription.

disequilibrium (LD; r2 > 0.8) with the original association reported 
for another disease (Supplementary Table 3). The two exceptions 
were 11q23, where only independent disease associations (r2 < 0.01) 
have so far been reported17, and 6q15, where the most significantly 
associated PSC variant, rs56258221 (OR = 1.23; P = 8.36 × 10−12), 
was in low-to-moderate LD with the previously reported BACH2
variants in Crohn’s disease (r2 = 0.23) and type 1 diabetes (r2 = 0.12). 
Three out of four known non-HLA PSC risk loci present on the 
Immunochip passed genotyping quality control and were confirmed 
in our analysis (1p36, 3p21 and 10p15; Supplementary Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Note).
To prioritize candidate genes within the non-HLA genome￾wide significant loci, we searched for the functional consequences 
of the most associated SNPs or the SNPs in high LD with these 
(r2 > 0.8), focusing on missense SNPs (Supplementary Fig. 4 and 
Supplementary Table 4) and expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTLs) (Supplementary Table 5), and we functionally annotated risk 
loci using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) 
Project (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Note)18. We also 
constructed networks on the basis of functional similarity measures 
(Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5), known protein-protein 
interactions (DAPPLE19; Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary 
Note) and the published literature (GRAIL20; Supplementary Fig. 6
and Supplementary Note) to identify disease-relevant genes. 
For 6 of the 12 genome-wide significant loci, the same gene 
(MMEL1, CD28, MST1, SH2B3, CD226 and SIK2) was annotated by 
more than 1 method (Supplementary Table 7), suggesting these as 
candidates for further investigation at these loci.
Two newly associated loci are located outside of the Immunochip 
fine-mapping regions (Fig. 1d,e). At 11q23, the most strongly asso￾ciated SNP, rs7937682 (OR = 1.17; P = 3.17 × 10−9), is located in 
an intron of SIK2 (encoding salt-inducible kinase 2), which influ￾ences the expression of both interleukin (IL)-10 in macrophages 
and Nur77, an important transcription factor in leukocytes21. The 
association at 12q13 was with an intronic SNP, rs11168249 (OR = 
1.15; P = 5.49 × 10−9), within the HDAC7 gene (encoding histone 
deacetylase 7), which has also been associated with IBD22. HDAC7 
has been implicated in the negative selection of T cells in the thy￾mus23, a key process in the development of immune tolerance. 
A role for HDAC7 in PSC etiology is supported by the new association 
at 19q13, where the most associated SNP, rs60652743 (OR = 1.25; 
P = 6.51 × 10−10), is located within an intron of PRKD2 (encoding 
serine-threonine protein kinase D2). When T cell receptors of thy￾mocytes are engaged, PRKD2 phosphorylates HDAC7, leading to 
nuclear exclusion of HDAC7 and loss of its gene regulatory functions, 
ultimately resulting in apoptosis and negative selection of immature 
T cells24,25. Notably, this negative selection takes place owing to a 
loss of HDAC7-mediated repression of Nur77 (regulated by SIK2)26, 
linking three new PSC loci to this pathway.
The associations at the HLA complex at 6p21 were refined 
by imputing alleles at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, 
HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DPB1 (Supplementary Note)27. 
The top associated SNP (rs4143332) was in almost perfect LD 
(r2 = 0.996) with HLA-B*08:01 (Supplementary Note). In stepwise 
conditional analysis including both SNP and HLA allele genotypes, 
rs4143332 (tagging HLA-B*08:01) and a complex HLA class II asso￾ciation signal determined by HLA-DQA1*01:03 and SNPs rs532098, 
rs1794282 and rs9263964 (Supplementary Fig. 7) explained most 
of the HLA association signal in PSC. When performing stepwise 
regression of the HLA alleles only, the class II associations were 
consistent with previous reports, apart from a new association with 
HLA-DQA1*01:01 (Supplementary Tables 8–10 and Supplementary 
Note)9,28,29. The HLA-DRB1*15:01 association overlapped with the 
allele for ulcerative colitis (risk increasing) and Crohn’s disease (risk 
decreasing)30,31. Because imputed genotypes in the class II region 
were only available for 4 (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1 and 
HLA-DPB1) out of 20 loci32, further studies involving direct sequenc￾ing of all HLA class II loci along with assessments of protein structure 
and peptide binding are required to causally resolve the link between 
this HLA subregion and PSC development33,34.
Although 72% of the PSC cases in this study have a diagnosis 
of concomitant IBD (Supplementary Table 11), only half of our 
genome-wide significant loci were associated with IBD in the recent 
International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) Immunochip anal￾ysis (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 3)22, 
despite the greater sample size of that study (25,683 cases and 15,977 
controls). Across the 12 non-HLA PSC-associated loci, we observed 
greater similarity between the OR estimates for PSC and ulcerative 
colitis than for those of PSC and Crohn’s disease. We used the Crohn’s 
disease and ulcerative colitis OR estimates for the 163 IBD-­associated

Figure 2 Genetic similarity of loci associated with PSC and IBD. (a) Comparison of ORs for the most associated risk allele in PSC and the same allele 
in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis across the 12 genome-wide significant PSC-associated loci. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease ORs and 
the designation of IBD loci as ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease or both (IBD) were obtained from Jostins et al.22. Error bars represent 95% confidence 
intervals of the ORs. *, the PSC associated alleles at 6q15 (BACH2), 10p15 (IL2RA) and 19q13 (PRKD2) are independent of the reported IBD 
associations (r2 < 0.3) but are located in the same broad genetic region as the IBD-associated SNPs; for this reason, these loci are defined as PSC-IBD 
loci in Supplementary Figure 9 but as PSC-only allelic associations here. (b) Predicting PSC using OR estimates across 163 IBD-associated loci. 
The green and orange lines represent the ROC curves for discriminating PSC cases from population controls using ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease 
ORs from 163 loci associated with IBD, respectively22. The dashed diagonal line is y = x, and specifies the ROC curve of a random predictor.

loci to predict PSC case-control status in 
our sample (Online Methods)22 and found a 
significantly greater area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) when applying ulcera￾tive colitis ORs compared to Crohn’s disease ORs (ulcerative colitis 
AUC = 0.62, Crohn’s disease AUC = 0.56; P = 1.2 × 10−57; Fig. 2b). 
This suggests that PSC is genetically more similar to ulcerative colitis 
than to Crohn’s disease and is consistent with clinical observations of 
greater comorbidity of PSC with ulcerative colitis than with Crohn’s 
disease35. To further compare the genetic profiles of PSC and IBD, we 
combined our genome-wide significant PSC-associated loci with the 
163 confirmed IBD-associated loci22 in a functional similarity network 
(Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 12). We found that 
the PSC loci were distributed throughout the IBD loci (Supplementary 
Fig. 9), suggesting that there is no particular functional subcluster of 
IBD susceptibility genes associated with PSC and vice versa.
Although we consider only those loci reaching a stringent sig￾nificance threshold (P < 5 × 10−8) to be conclusively associated with 
PSC, it is likely that additional true associations lie among SNPs with 
weaker associations. An alternative approach for controlling for mul￾tiple hypothesis testing is false discovery rate (FDR) control, which 
regulates the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypo￾theses. FDR control is well suited to focused genotyping platforms 
such as the Metabochip36 and the Immunochip because it implic￾itly accounts for the expected enrichment in association. To further 
increase this enrichment, we exploited the known pleiotropy between 
related immune-mediated traits37 and calculated the FDR38–40 for 
association with PSC conditional on previously published summary 
statistics from each of the related phenotypes (yielding a per-SNP 
conditional FDR)41 (Online Methods). We identified 33 non-HLA 
loci with conditional FDR < 0.001 in this analysis (Fig. 3), all of which 
showed suggestive levels of significance (5 × 10−8 < P < 5 × 10−5) in 
the standard association analysis (Supplementary Figs. 10–12 and 
Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). These loci were integrated into 
the functional similarity network analysis (Supplementary Fig. 13
and Supplementary Table 15), highlighting potential candidate 
susceptibility genes.
In conclusion, the present study increases the number of genome￾wide significant loci in PSC from 7 to 16 (including the HLA com￾plex). The 9 new variants together explain 0.9% of variance in PSC 
liability, increasing the total amount of variance explained by the 
16 known loci to 7.3% (Online Methods). The data convincingly 
show that genetic susceptibility to PSC extends considerably beyond 
risk factors involved in the closely related IBD phenotype and into 
autoimmune pathophysiology. Furthermore, analysis of pleiotropic 
immune-related genetic variants highlights 33 additional suggestive 
loci in PSC, overall representing major new avenues for research 
into pathogenesis.

at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet (Oslo, Norway) and the Nord-Trøndelag 
Health Study (HUNT) are acknowledged for sharing healthy Norwegian controls. 
Banco Nacional de ADN (Salamanca, Spain) is acknowledged for providing 
Spanish control samples. This study makes use of genotyping data generated by the 
Dietary, Life style and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome 
(DILGOM) consortium (see URLs), the Cooperative Research in the Region of 
Augsburg (KORA) study and the Heinz Nixdorf Recall (Risk Factors, Evaluation of 
Coronary Calcification, and Lifestyle) study. We acknowledge the members of the 
International PSC Study Group, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive 
and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium 
(IBDGC), the UK-PSC Consortium and the Alberta IBD Consortium for their 
participation. J. Barrett is acknowledged for contributions to the design of the 
Figure 3 Pleiotropic PSC loci. Manhattan plot 
of conditional associations in PSC calculated as 
stratified FDRs on the basis of the results of the 
present PSC analysis and genetic associations 
previously reported in seven immune-mediated 
diseases (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, 
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, 
type 1 diabetes and ulcerative colitis) 
(Online Methods and Supplementary Figs. 10–12). 
SNPs in red represent genome-wide significant 
findings from the main association analysis 
(Table 1), and SNPs in black are significantly 
associated with PSC conditional on their 
pleiotropic effects across the related 
immune-mediated diseases. The horizontal red 
line represents a threshold of FDR < 0.001 
(Supplementary Table 13), and the blue 
horizontal line represents a threshold of FDR 
< 0.01 (see Supplementary Table 14 for a full 
listing of identified loci).

ONLINE METHODS
Study subjects. The study participants are described in Supplementary 
Table 16 and the Supplementary Note.
Ethical approval. Subject recruitment was approved by the ethics committees 
or institutional review boards of all participating centers. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants.
Quality control. SNPs with call rate < 80% were removed before commenc￾ing sample quality control (n = 235). Per-individual genotype call rate and 
heterozygosity rate were calculated using PLINK42, and outlying samples 
were identified using Aberrant43, which automatically identifies outliers in 
otherwise Gaussian distributions (Supplementary Fig. 1). A set of 20,837 
LD-pruned (r2 < 0.1) SNPs with MAF > 10% present on both the Immunochip 
and the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 array used in the 1000 Genomes Project 
(see URLs) were used to estimate identity by descent and ancestry. For each 
pair of individuals with estimated identity by descent ≥0.9, the sample with 
the lower call rate was removed (unless case-control status was discordant 
between the pair, in which case, both samples were removed, n = 92). Related 
individuals (0.1875 < identity by descent <0.9) remained in the analysis to 
maximize power because mixed model association analysis can correctly 
account for relatedness. Principal-components analysis, implemented in 
SMARTPCA (Eigenstrat)44, was used to identify samples of non-European 
ancestry. Principal components were defined using population samples from 
the 1000 Genomes Project45 genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-
8 genotyping array (see URLs) and then projected into cases and controls 
(Supplementary Fig. 2)14,22,46. After sample quality control, 3,789 PSC cases 
and 25,079 controls remained. SNPs with MAF of less than 0.1%, Hardy￾Weinberg equilibrium P <1 × 10−5 or call rate lower than 98% and those that 
failed the PLINK v1.07 non-random differential missing data rate test between 
cases and controls (P < 1 × 10−5) were excluded. After the completion of 
marker quality control (Supplementary Table 2), 131,220 SNPs were available 
for analysis, further reduced to 130,422 after cluster plot inspection.
Statistical methods. Genomic inflation factor. The Immunochip contains 3,120 
SNPs that were part of a bipolar disease replication effort and other studies 
that were not immune related. After quality control, 2,544 of these were used 
as null markers to estimate the overall inflation of the distribution of associa￾tion test statistics.
Imputation. Using 85,747 SNPs after quality control located in the Immunochip 
fine-mapping regions, additional genotypes were imputed using IMPUTE2 
with the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (March 2012) reference panel of 
1,092 individuals47 and 744,740 SNPs. Imputation was performed separately 
in ten batches, with the case:control and country of origin ratios constant 
across batches. SNPs with a posterior probability less than 0.9 and those with 
differential missingness (P < 1 × 10−5) in the ten batches were removed, as 
were SNPs that did not pass the exclusion thresholds used for genotyped SNP 
quality control. After imputation, a total of 163,379 SNPs in the Immunochip 
fine-mapping regions, including 153,857 SNPs from the reference panel, were 
available for analysis.
Association analysis. Case-control association tests were performed using a 
linear mixed model as implemented in MMM15. A covariance matrix, R, of a 
random-effects component was included in the model to explicitly account for 
confounding due to population stratification and cryptic relatedness between 
individuals. This method has been shown to better control for population 
stratification than correction for principal components or meta-analyses of 
matched subgroups of cases and controls48–50. R is a symmetric n × n matrix 
with each entry representing the relative sharing of alleles between two indi￾viduals compared to the average in the sample, and it is typically estimated 
using genome-wide SNP data15. To avoid biases in the estimation of R due to 
the design of the Immunochip, SNPs were first pruned for LD (r2 < 0.1). Of 
the remaining SNPs, we then removed those that were in the HLA region or 
had MAF <10%. Finally, we excluded SNPs that showed modest association 
(P < 0.005) with PSC in a linear regression model fitting the first ten principal 
components as covariates. A total of 17,260 SNPs were used to estimate R.
Owing to computational limitations, we estimated the R matrix and per￾formed all association analyses applying R separately for UK (n = 9,696) and 
non-UK (n = 19,172) samples and then combined the results using a fixed￾effects (inverse variance–weighted) meta-analysis, as carried out previously48. 
This reduced the λGC inflation factor, estimated using the 2,544 null SNPS, 
from 1.24 to 1.02 (Supplementary Fig. 14), showing excellent control for 
population stratification. Stepwise conditional regression was used to identify 
possible independent associations at genome-wide significant loci. SNP × SNP 
interactions between all pairs of genome-wide significant SNPs were tested 
using the PLINK-epistasis command. Signal intensity plots of all non-HLA 
loci with association P value <5 × 10−6 were visually inspected using Evoker51. 
SNPs that clustered poorly were removed (n = 798).
Prediction of PSC using IBD SNPs. OR estimates for Crohn’s disease and ulcera￾tive colitis in 163 IBD-associated SNPs were obtained from Jostins et al.22. We 
used the R package Mangrove (see URLs) to estimate each individual’s prob￾ability of developing PSC in our 3,789 PSC cases and 25,079 controls, assuming 
additive risk (log-additive OR). The performance of our predictor using either 
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis ORs was assessed by constructing a ROC 
curve, showing the proportion of true and false positives at each probability 
threshold. The AUC was calculated to compare the predictive powers of the 
ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease ORs. The DeLong method was used to 
test whether the AUC was significantly greater using ulcerative colitis ORs 
compared to Crohn’s disease ORs52.
Functional similarity networks. In functional similarity networks, each edge 
represents the strong functional similarity of two genes based on annotated 
Gene Ontology (GO) terms as determined by the functional similarity measure 
rfunSim53. rfunSim similarity values above the recommended cutoff of 0.8 
were retrieved using the FunSimMat web service54. Resulting networks were 
visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape55.
To construct PSC-specific networks from functional similarity networks 
that contained more than one gene per locus (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 13), 
the connectivity of each gene was assessed by computing different topology 
measures for the corresponding node: (i) degree (number of direct edges to 
other nodes), (ii) shortest path closeness (inverted average shortest path dis￾tance to other nodes) and (iii) shortest path betweeness (fraction of shortest 
paths passing through the node). Similarity edges between genes in the same 
locus and gene nodes that were not contained in the resulting largest connected 
subnetworks were ignored. Genes were first ranked according to each measure 
and were then assigned the best of the three ranks. The PSC-specific network 
was generated from the top ranked genes in their respective loci.
Pleiotropy analysis. We included summary statistics from GWAS of seven 
PSC-associated diseases (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, sarcoidosis, type 1 diabetes and ulcerative colitis; Supplementary 
Table 17). For all diseases, we constructed conditional stratified quantile￾quantile plots of the empirical quantiles of nominal −log10 (P values) for SNP 
association with PSC for all SNPs (Supplementary Fig. 10) and for different 
overlapping subsets of SNPs determined by the significance of their association 
with the PSC-associated autoimmune disorder (SNP subsets defined by P <1, 
P <0.1, P <0.01 and P <0.001 in the pleiotropic phenotype). For a given 
PSC-associated phenotype, enrichment for pleiotropic signals in PSC can be 
observed as an increasing leftward deflection from the expected null distribu￾tion with lower P-value thresholds in the second phenotype (Supplementary 
Note). Enrichment in the stratified quantile-quantile plots is directly inter￾pretable in terms of the true discovery rate (TDR), equivalent to 1–FDR56. 
Specifically, it can be shown that a conservative estimate of FDR can be 
calculated from the horizontal shift of the quantile-quantile curve from the 
expected line y = x, with a larger shift corresponding to a smaller FDR for a 
given nominal P value (Supplementary Note). We calculated the conditional 
TDR as a function of P value in PSC across a series of P-value thresholds in 
the pleiotropic trait (Supplementary Fig. 10).
To assess the significance of the association with PSC, we assigned a pleio￾tropic (conditional) FDR value for PSC for each SNP. The pleiotropic FDR 
value for each SNP was based on the P value of the SNP in PSC relative to the 
P-value distribution of other SNPs in the same conditioning subset, where

subsets were defined by the pleiotropic association (lowest P value among 
associated diseases) of the SNP. Notably, the conditioning procedure was 
blind to the P value of the SNP with respect to PSC. The pleiotropic FDR 
was then interpolated from conditional FDR curves using established strati￾fied FDR methods41,57 (Supplementary Note). The increase in power from 
using pleiotropic FDR is demonstrated by dividing the total sample in half and 
observing that empirical replication rates between the training and test halves 
increase with decreasing P value in the pleiotropic disease (Supplementary 
Fig. 15). The SNP with the lowest FDR within each LD block (as defined by 
1000 Genomes Project data) was considered the lead SNP of a new pleiotropic 
PSC locus, if below a threshold of 0.001 (loci defined by FDR < 0.001 and FDR 
< 0.01 are shown in Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). All test statistics were 
adjusted for population stratification by genomic control (Supplementary 
Fig. 16 and Supplementary Note).
Variance explained and heritability. The proportion of variance explained 
by the genome-wide significant loci and HLA alleles was calculated using 
a liability threshold model58 assuming a disease prevalence of 10 in 100,000 
and multiplicative risk.
