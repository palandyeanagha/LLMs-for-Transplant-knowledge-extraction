Reductively metabolized glutamine is a major cellular carbon source for fatty acid synthesis
during hypoxia or when mitochondrial respiration is impaired. Yet, a mechanistic under￾standing of what determines reductive metabolism is missing. Here we identify several
cellular conditions where the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio is changed due to an altered
acetyl-CoA to citrate conversion, and demonstrate that reductive glutamine metabolism is
initiated in response to perturbations that result in an increase in the a-ketoglutarate/citrate
ratio. Thus, targeting reductive glutamine conversion for a therapeutic benefit might require
distinct modulations of metabolite concentrations rather than targeting the upstream
signalling, which only indirectly affects the process.

Uncontrolled cell proliferation associated with cancer
necessitates metabolic alterations to support rapid cell
growth; hence, understanding these changes is of critical
importance in identifying new and promising cancer therapies1,2.
Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating how
altered signalling events promote uncontrolled proliferation in
cancer, our knowledge regarding the metabolic rearrangements
that provide building blocks for biomass, ATP and generation of
reducing equivalents remains limited3,4. Recently, we and other
groups identified reductively metabolized glutamine as the major
carbon source of fatty acid synthesis during hypoxia and impaired
respiration5–8. Moreover, this switch in carbon source selection
was shown to be of particular importance for sustaining rapid cell
proliferation5,7.
Both hypoxia and the loss of the Von-Hippel Lindau gene
(VHL)
9,10 promote reductive glutamine metabolism, whereas
inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 1 (PDK1), a
target of the VHL–hypoxia-inducible factor 1a axis11,12, also
decreases reductive glutamine utilization in various cell systems5,7.
In addition, reductive glutamine utilization is activated during
impaired respiration, thereby raising the possibility that alterations
in NADþ /NADH metabolism might be involved6. However, a
mechanistic understanding of how hypoxia, respiratory impair￾ment and expression changes in VHL and PDK1 all converge
to impact reductive glutamine metabolism is lacking. As a result,
the prediction of how other environmental, genetic or pharmaco￾logical interventions might trigger reductive glutamine utilization
is not possible.
In this study we aim to identify how the switch to reductive
glutamine utilization is controlled in cells. To this end we
systematically measure changes in metabolite levels and metabolic
flux contributions in cancer cell lines, following various cellular
perturbations, and examine the impact of these changes on
reductive glutamine metabolism. We find that reductive gluta￾mine metabolism is a general phenomenon that occurs in
response to any intervention that increases the a-ketoglutarate/
citrate ratio. Specifically, changes in this ratio are predicted to
increase reductive glutamine metabolism by mass action.
Furthermore, in most conditions tested, a decrease in acetyl￾CoA (AcCoA) to citrate conversion, triggered by one of at least
two different mechanisms, is an event responsible for the
alteration in the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio, suggesting this as
a key node in determining reductive glutamine metabolism.
Results
Oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism. In mammalian
cells, glutamine can be an important contributor of carbon to the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle13,14, where it can be metabolized in
the oxidative or reductive direction5,6. Reductive glutamine
metabolism involves the conversion of a-ketoglutarate to citrate
and acts as a carbon source to fuel fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 1a). In
oxidative glutamine metabolism, a-ketoglutarate is oxidized to
succinate for the eventual conversion to citrate by the TCA cycle.
Interconversion of citrate and isocitrate is necessary for the TCA
cycle to operate in either direction; this reaction is often found
close to equilibrium such that isocitrate is maintained at B6.5%
of the citrate concentration15. We experimentally validated
the equilibrium assumption for the culture conditions and treat￾ments tested here, and found the isocitrate concentration to be
4.1±0.79% of the citrate concentration under standard culture
condition and 5.3±0.85% of the citrate concentration following
metformin treatment. Therefore, to simplify our analysis we
focused our measurements on citrate as the more abundant
metabolite. As a-ketoglutarate and citrate levels represent the
substrate or product in key reactions of reductive versus oxidative
glutamine metabolism, their levels are predicted to be critical
parameters in determining the reaction direction. Although both
metabolites are present in the cytosol and the mitochondria, we
analysed the total pool size because of the lack of established
methods to quantitatively separate the two pools. Furthermore,
we decided to specifically focus on the reductive glutamine
contribution instead of the reductive net flux, because net fluxes
per se are also a function of growth rate16. As many of the
perturbations used in this study influence cell growth, it is
impossible to control for secondary effects on net flux resulting
from changes in cell growth.
Reductive carboxylation is regulated on a metabolic level. To
elucidate the mechanism responsible for the switch from oxida￾tive to reductive glutamine utilization, we measured reductive
glutamine contribution to citrate and changes in the levels of
citrate and a-ketoglutarate using U-13C glutamine and gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry5. We compared cells under
conditions previously described to induce reductive glutamine
metabolism: hypoxia, or treatment with rotenone, metformin
and antimycin a5–8. The respiratory chain inhibitors rotenone,
metformin and antimycin a were all used at concentrations that
cause an B50% decrease in oxygen consumption (Supplementary
Fig. S1). As expected, reductive glutamine contribution to citrate
(identified by the level of the M þ 5 mass isotopomer of citrate
from U-13C glutamine (Supplementary Fig. S2a)) increased for all
conditions compared with the control condition (Fig. 1b).
Furthermore, the citrate and a-ketoglutarate levels decreased in
all conditions; however, the decrease in citrate was much greater
than the decrease in a-ketoglutarate (Fig. 1c). Strikingly, the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio correlated with the magnitude
of reductive glutamine contribution to citrate (Fig. 1b,c,e and
Supplementary Data 1). This suggests that changes in the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio could be the principal driving force
for the switch from oxidative glucose to reductive glutamine
metabolism, promoting the use of glutamine as the primary
carbon source for citrate synthesis. As lipogenic AcCoA is derived
from citrate5, this ratio might determine the source of carbon for
lipid synthesis (Fig. 1a).
The correlation between reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate and increased a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio raises the
question of how this ratio is determined. Besides glutamine,
glucose can also contribute to citrate and a-ketoglutarate levels17.
We inferred the latter flux contribution with a U-13C glucose
tracer by measuring the total glucose contribution to citrate or the
AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate. Total glucose contribu￾tion to citrate and AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate (M þ 2
of a-ketoglutarate from U-13C glucose (Supplementary Fig. S2b))
decreased in all conditions compared to with control (Fig. 1d).
Moreover, the percent of M þ 2 a-ketoglutarate from U-13C
glucose and the percent citrate labelling from glucose both
correlated inversely with the reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate (Fig. 1b,d,f), and thus the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio
(Fig. 1c,d). This suggests that carbon entry into the TCA cycle via
AcCoA can affect the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio, and also
suggest this as one point of regulation.
If carbon entry into the TCA cycle via AcCoA regulates the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio and reductive glutamine contribution
to citrate, then replenishing the pyruvate-derived citrate pool by
forcing carbon into the TCA cycle via AcCoA should decrease
reductive glutamine utilization. Increased glucose concentrations
cannot be used to increase the oxidative carbon entry into the
TCA cycle. However, as glucose can be converted to lactate,
supplementing the media with high concentrations of lactate can
impair cytosolic NAD þ regeneration and promote increased

carbon contribution via AcCoA into the TCA cycle. Addition of
lactate to the culture media shifts the reaction direction of lactate
dehydrogenase from net synthesis to net consumption of lactate
to produce pyruvate18. As the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion is a
major route of NAD þ regeneration from NADH, higher
lactate levels increase cytosolic NADH levels preventing cytosolic
NADþ recovery and increase carbon contribution into the TCA
cycle via AcCoA19 (Fig. 2a). Moreover, lactate addition uncouples
the use of glucose-derived carbon, as both lactate and glucose
feed into the same pyruvate pool. Lactate supplementation in
the control condition increased the AcCoA contribution to
a-ketoglutarate (M þ 3 in a-ketoglutarate from U-13C glutamine
(Supplementary Fig. S2a)) and decreased the a-ketoglutarate/
citrate ratio along with reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate (Supplementary Fig. S3a). We confirmed that the
increase in AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate during lactate
supplementation is a result of increased pyruvate entry by
comparing M þ 3 in a-ketoglutarate from U-13C glutamine to

M þ 2 in a-ketoglutarate, from U-13C lactate and U-13C
glucose. We found that the sum of the M þ 2 contributions
from glucose and lactate matched the M þ 3 contribution from
glutamine, showing that supplementation of lactate leads to a
joint contribution of glucose and lactate to pyruvate, and it’s
entry into the AcCoA pool (Supplementary Fig. S3b (left
panel)). Subsequently, we applied lactate supplementation to
conditions that induce reductive glutamine utilization and
found that AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate increased
(Fig. 2b) and the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio decreased
along with reductive glutamine contribution to citrate (Fig. 2c,
d and Supplementary Data 1). We again confirmed using the
rotenone þ lactate condition that both glucose and lactate
contribute to the AcCoA pool (Supplementary Fig. S3b (right
panel)). Notably, the effect seen following exposure to hypoxia,
rotenone and metformin was much more pronounced than that
seen for antimycin a. This may be because of the fact that
complex I inhibition can be circumvented using the glycerol
phosphate shuttle to pass electrons to complex II, whereas a
block in complex III cannot be bypassed20. Together, these data
show that carbon conversion to citrate via AcCoA modulates
the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio, which in turn might determine
the reductive glutamine contribution to citrate.
To further test the hypothesis that the a-ketoglutarate/citrate
ratio determines whether glutamine is converted oxidatively (via
glutamine anaplerosis) or reductively (via reductive carboxyla￾tion), we reasoned that supplementing cells that have increased
reductive glutamine usage with acetate (to directly replenish the
citrate pool (Fig. 3a)) or citrate should shift the ratio from
reductive back to oxidative glutamine utilization. To test this
possibility, we added acetate (25 mmol l  1) or citrate (0.3 and 1.2
mmol l  1) to cells in the presence of metformin. In the presence
of acetate, we measured the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio and
reductive glutamine contribution to citrate normalized to the total
glutamine contribution to citrate with a U-13C glutamine tracer
(Supplementary Fig. S2a). This normalization was undertaken
to prevent the unlikely possibility that addition of acetate
will disturb globally the metabolite pool sizes and thus lead to
an overall decrease in glutamine contribution to the metabolites.
Acetate decreased the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio and similarly
reduced the normalized reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate (Fig. 3b,c). The addition of acetate also led to increased
oxidative glutamine metabolism in the TCA cycle (Fig. 3d).
Furthermore, we tested whether acetate supplementation to
metformin treatment also decreases the reductive glutamine
contribution to palmitate using 5-13C glutamine (Fig. 3e and

Supplementary Fig. S4). In line with the citrate labelling data, we
measured reduced 5-13C glutamine labelling in m þ 5 to m þ 8
palmitate when acetate is supplemented in the medium of
metformin-treated cells. This finding corroborates that the
reductive conversion of glutamine is reduced when acetate is
added. With citrate supplementation, we measured the ratio
between oxidative and reductive glutamine utilization using a
U-13C-glutamine tracer. Measuring the a-ketoglutarate/citrate
ratio in this condition is not possible because of residual media
citrate impeding accurate measurements of intracellular citrate
levels. We determined the ratio of oxidative versus reductive
glutamine utilization based on M þ 4 in fumarate, malate and
aspartate (oxidative contribution) and M þ 3 in fumarate, malate
and aspartate (reductive contribution) (Supplementary Fig. S2c).
We found that the ratio between oxidative and reductive
glutamine utilization in the presence of metformin increased
with increasing citrate concentrations (Fig. 3f), further arguing
that the switch from oxidative to reductive glutamine utilization
is a function of the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio.
To determine whether glucose contribution to the TCA cycle
and the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio determines oxidative versus
reductive glutamine metabolism in another cell line, we measured
glucose contribution to the TCA cycle along with the corresponding
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratios under nine different growth condi￾tions in 143B osteosarcoma cells. Analysis of U-13C glucose and
U-13C glutamine tracer data demonstrates that the levels of
reductive glutamine contribution to citrate varied by eightfold
with treatments (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 1). Addition
of lactate, b-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (NAD þ
precursor) and the mitochondrial uncoupling agent carbonyl
cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) decreased
reductive glutamine contribution, whereas addition of 5-aminoi￾midazole-4-carboxamide 1-b-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) (a pre￾cursor of AMP) had only minor effects that were not statistically
significant. Oligomycin (a direct inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP
synthase), rotenone, metformin and antimycin a, all led to
increased reductive glutamine contribution to citrate (Fig. 4a).
The AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate, the total pyruvate
contribution to citrate, citrate, as well as the a-ketoglutarate/
citrate ratio were correlated with reductive glutamine contribu￾tion to citrate (Fig. 4b–h). With the exception of lactate
supplementation, total pyruvate contribution to citrate is given

the sum of the total glucose and lactate contribution to citrate.
Notably, for some stress conditions (lactate, oligomycin, rotenone
and metformin), a-ketoglutarate instead of citrate is the major
contributor to the change in the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio
(Fig. 4d). Nonetheless, the a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio, but not
a-ketoglutarate or citrate levels themselves, correlate most
strongly with the per cent reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate (Fig. 4g,h). This observation strongly argues that the ratio,
rather than the a-ketoglutarate nor the citrate concentration
themselves, is the major determinant of reductive glutamine
utilization. Thus, it is unlikely that a-ketoglutarate (or isocitrate)
concentrations per se regulates isocitrate dehydrogenase on the
enzyme level.
To expand our findings and exclude the possibility that the effects
we observed could all be accounted for by an increase in
a-ketoglutarate-to-citrate carbon exchange or be compromised by
labelled CO2 fixation, we measured the reductive glutamine
contribution to the fatty acid palmitate in the PC3 prostate
adenocarcinoma cell line (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data 1).
Reductive glutamine contribution to palmitate was measured using
a 5-13C-glutamine tracer, which reaches palmitate only through
reductive glutamine metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S4). The
contribution of this tracer to palmitate was calculated based on an
isotopic spectral analysis model21,22. The nine conditions tested
spanned a 14-fold range of reductive glutamine contribution to
palmitate (Fig. 5). Similar to the results obtained with citrate
labelling in A549 and 143B cells, reductive glutamine contribution
to palmitate correlated with AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate,
the total glucose contribution to citrate and the a-ketoglutarate/
citrate ratio (Fig. 5). These results further corroborate the
hypothesis that the above mentioned criteria determine the extent
of reductive glutamine metabolism across a wide range of cellular
conditions.
To further elucidate that an increase in reductive glutamine
contribution to citrate results in a net flux increase such as it has
been shown previously for hypoxia5, we measured the net
reductive glutamine flux to palmitate in the presence of antimycin
a, oligomycin or 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) (Supple￾mentary Fig. S5). In accordance with results observed under
hypoxia, we found that the net reductive glutamine flux to
palmitate increased in the presence of antimycin a, oligomycin or
TTFA by approximately six-, five- and threefold, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S5). This data suggests that at least in certain
conditions this major switch in carbon fueling results also in a net
flux increase.
Multiple upstream events influence carbon entry into the TCA
cycle. To investigate whether there is a sole signalling event that
controls carbon entry into the TCA cycle via AcCoA, we further
tested how reductive glutamine contribution to citrate is regulated
under hypoxia and in the presence of complex I/III inhibitors
(rotenone, metformin and antimycin a). It has been shown pre￾viously that inhibition of PDK1 with dichloroacetate (DCA)
reduces the contribution of reductive glutamine carboxylation in
hypoxia5. To evaluate the extent by which PDKs impact reductive
glutamine utilization, we determined the effect of the PDK
inhibitor DCA23,24 on the reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate in the presence of rotenone, metformin or antimycin a. The
dose of DCA was adjusted to a concentration that significantly
reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1a Ser232
phosphorylation in hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S6). The
concentration of 5 mmol l  1 DCA that met these criteria
matches the concentration used previously5. Our data
corroborated that PDK inhibition by DCA significantly reduced
reductive glutamine contribution to citrate in hypoxia (Fig. 6a)5,
but DCA did not alter reductive carboxylation in the presence of
complex I/III inhibitors (Fig. 6a), suggesting that these stresses
may utilize distinct mechanisms.
One consequence of respiratory chain inhibition is decreased
mitochondrial conversion of NADH to NAD þ and thus a
reduced mitochondrial NAD þ /NADH ratio6,25. Interestingly, the
pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is coupled to this cofactor
ratio17; therefore, it is possible that changes in the mitochondrial
NAD þ /NADH ratio following complex I/III inhibition are
responsible for reduced carbon entry into the TCA cycle via
AcCoA. To test this hypothesis, we measured the NAD þ /NADH
ratio using HPLC (Supplementary Fig. S8), in cells growing in
standard culture conditions and under the four stress conditions.
We confirmed literature data that, indeed, the NAD þ /NADH
ratio decreased by more than tenfold in the presence of complex
I/III inhibitors compared with that of the control (Fig. 6b);
however, there was no significant alteration of the NAD þ /
NADH ratio under hypoxia (Fig. 6b). We further estimated from
the lactate to pyruvate ratio the amount of free NAD þ /NADH in
the cytosol. As expected, the cytosolic lactate to pyruvate ratio26
increased following rotenone, metformin and antimycin a
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S9), suggesting that the total
decrease in NAD þ /NADH measured likely occurs mainly in the
mitochondria. Thus, this ratio could mediate the directionality of
glutamine metabolism in the presence of respiratory chain
inhibitors.

NAD þ /NADH ratio (Fig. 7a). As expected from literature data,
NMN addition increased the NAD þ /NADH ratio in the presence
of metformin by more than fivefold compared with the presence
of metformin alone (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the AcCoA contribution
to a-ketoglutarate increased when NMN was added to metformin￾treated cells, while the reductive glutamine contribution decreased
(Fig. 7c,d). These data suggest that changes in the NADþ /NADH
ratio elicited by respiratory chain inhibitors changes the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio, which in turn shifts glutamine
utilization from oxidative to reductive.
Although the above data suggest that the NAD þ /NADH ratio
affects the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, it is unclear whether
this happens directly via cofactor coupling or indirectly via effects
on PDK4 activity. Thus, we tested whether PDK4 is expressed
differently in hypoxia compared with the complex I/III inhibitors
(Supplementary Fig. S3c). We found that the PDK4 expression
increased by approximately threefold during metformin treat￾ment compared with hypoxia. PDK4-mediated phosphorylation
inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and PDK4 is known to
be strongly regulated by the NAD þ /NADH ratio28. If the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is directly inhibited by the
NAD þ /NADH ratio via cofactor coupling, instead of PDK4-
mediated phosphorylation, addition of NMN in the presence of
DCA (which inhibits PDK4 (ref. 28)) and metformin should still
increase the AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate (Fig. 7a).
Thus, we added DCA at concentrations determined to block
PDHE1a phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S6) and found
that NMN increased AcCoA contribution to a-ketoglutarate
and, as expected, decreased reductive glutamine contribution to
citrate in the presence of metformin plus DCA, excluding the
involvement of PDK4 (Fig. 7e,f). Although the NAD þ /NADH
ratio can control carbon entry into the TCA cycle, and thus
reductive carboxylation, other regulatory events resulting from
complex I/III inhibition cannot be excluded. These data suggest
that although alterations in PDH activity via phosphorylation can
promote reductive carboxylation, this is not the only mechanism
active under all conditions.
Discussion
Reductive glutamine contribution to metabolites and biomass
building blocks was recently identified as a phenomenon to
support growth of hypoxic and respiratory chain impaired cells5–8.
We demonstrate here a general mechanistic explanation for
how metabolic rearrangements enable reductive glutamine
contribution to citrate (Fig. 8). Although our approach is limited
in looking at cell metabolite levels without information about
compartmentalization of pathways, with the consequence that we
cannot provide thermodynamic calculations, we identified the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio itself as a critical determinant of
reductive glutamine utilization. In some cases, this may not
represent a true increase in net flux, but a relative flux change with
increased exchange may also be involved as both lead to increased
5-carbon-labelled citrate from glutamine. Nevertheless, altered
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratios can promote increased net reductive
glutamine flux under some conditions including hypoxia5 or
treatment with antimycin a, oligomycin or TTFA.
A wide range of conditions influence the a-ketoglutarate/
citrate ratio by modulating carbon entry into the TCA cycle via
AcCoA. Moreover, our data demonstrate that other events (for
example, acetate or citrate supplementation) that alter the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio will have a role in determining
whether glutamine is metabolized oxidatively or reductively.
Regarding the carbon entry into the TCA cycle via AcCoA, there
are at least two upstream mechanisms explaining how carbon
entry (and subsequent downstream metabolic changes) are
regulated. In the case of hypoxia, decreased carbon entry into
the TCA cycle is driven at least in part by PDK1-mediated
inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, whereas complex I/III
inhibition decreases carbon entry into the TCA cycle through
a decrease in the NAD þ /NADH ratio. The latter is the
result of mitochondrial electron transport inhibition, which
in turn decreases pyruvate to AcCoA conversion likely via
cofactor coupling. By extension, any condition that affects the
a-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio, regardless of the upstream regulation
that initiates this change, is predicted to alter reductive versus
oxidative glutamine utilization and consequently the fueling
source for proliferation relevant fatty acid synthesis. Although our
approach has the limitation that we cannot conclude whether
reductive carboxylation takes place in the mitochondria or the
cytosol, this mechanistic understanding allows for the first time
predictions of environmental and genetic conditions, which
promote reductive glutamine utilization and might lead to the
development of drugs inhibiting this process.
Although reductive carboxylation has mainly been investigated
in cancer cells, there is evidence that at least some non-transformed
cell also use this pathway (for example, non-transformed cells
from brown fat (differentiated brown adipocytes22), lung (MRC5
(ref. 5)), prostate (p69; S.-M. Fendt, unpublished data) and normal
lymphocytes5 Hence, this mode of regulation may allow carbon
metabolism to rapidly adapt to changing growth conditions. In this
way, the cell can immediately switch carbon source utilization
without involving complex transcriptional or allosteric regulation
and ensure optimal substrate usage to support growth under

various conditions. Furthermore, this mechanism is a consequence
of any upstream event altering a-ketoglutarate and/or citrate levels
and requires no further energy investment. Yet, to which extent
NAD(P)þ /NAD(P)H levels, which are cofactors coupled to the
a-ketoglutarate to citrate ratio and affect the activity of enzymes,
such as glutamate dehydrogenase, influence the reaction direction
remains to be determined, but some influence is likely based on
kinetic considerations. As a result, targeting reductive glutamine
metabolism for therapeutic benefit may require an approach that
impacts intrinsic properties of the metabolic network, rather than
interruption of signalling events that indirectly influence the
process.
Methods
Cell lines and cell culture conditions. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC.
All experiments were performed in DMEM (Mediatech) with 10% dialysed fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% pen/strep (Mediatech), and glucose or gluta￾mine with either U-13C glucose (CLM-1396 Cambridge Isotopes), U-13C glutamine
(605166 Sigma) or 5-13C glutamine (CLM-1166 Cambridge Isotopes). Cell lines
were treated for 1 day or, in case of fatty acid labelling, for 3 days. Growth
conditions were altered in the following ways: AICAR 0.25 mmol l  1 (143B),
antimycin 2 mg ml  1 (PC3) and 20 ng l  1 (A549, 143B), citrate 0.3 and
1.2 mmol l  1 (A549), DCA 5 mmol l  1 (A549, PC3), FCCP 10 mmol l  1 (PC3)
and 2.5 mmol l  1 (143B), hypoxia 1% (A549, 143B, PC3), lactate 25 mmol l  1
(A549, 143B), metformin 1 mmol l  1 (A549, 143B), myxothiazol 1 mmol l  1
(PC3), NMN 25 mmol l  1 (A549, 143B), oligomycin 5 mmol l  1 (PC3) and
2.5 mmol l  1 (143B), rotenone 1 mg ml  1 (PC3) and 10 ng ml  1 (A549, 143B) and
TTFA 400 mmol l  1 (PC3). All compounds were obtained from Sigma.
Oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption was measured with an Oxytherm
instrument (Hansatech). Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in fresh media.
Oxygen consumption of detached cells was measured for 10 min. The slope of the
linear range was used to calculate rates. Error bars are from biological replicates.
Carbon contribution to TCA cycle and palmitate. To assess metabolite levels and
metabolite labelling, we applied the methods described in Metallo et al.5 In brief,
labelled tissue cultures were washed with saline and metabolism was quenched with
 20 C cold 65% methanol. After cell scraping in 65% methanol,  20 C cold
chloroform was added and the samples were vortexed at 4 C to extract
metabolites. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 4 C. Methanol
phase (polar metabolites) and chloroform phase (fatty acids) were separated and
dried by applying constant air flow. Dried metabolite samples were stored
at  80 C.
Polar metabolite samples were derivatized with methoxyamine (Thermo
Scientific) for 90 min at 40 C and subsequently with N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N￾methyl-trifluoroacetamide, with 1% tert-Butyldimethylchlorosilane (Sigma) for
60 min at 60 C. Fatty acids were esterified with sulphuric acid/methanol for
120 min at 60 C and subsequently extracted with hexane. Isotopomer distributions
of polar metabolites and fatty acids were measured with a 6890N GC system
(Agilent Technologies) combined with a 5975B Inert XL MS system (Agilent
Technologies). One microlitre of samples was injected in splitless mode with an
inlet temperature of 270 C onto a DB35MS column. The carrier gas was helium
with a flow rate of 1 ml min  1. For the measurement of polar metabolites the oven
was held at 100 C for 3 min and then ramped to 300 C with a gradient of
2.5 C min  1. For fatty acid samples, the oven was held at 80 C for 1 min and
ramped with 5 C min  1 to 300 C. The MS system was operated under electron
impact ionization at 70 eV. A mass range of 100–650 amu was scanned.
Isotopomer distributions were extracted from the raw ion chromatograms using
a custom Matlab M-file, which applies consistent integration bounds and baseline
correction to each ion29. In addition, we corrected for naturally occurring isotopes
using the method of Fernandez et al.30 Total contribution of carbon was calculated
using the following equation31:
Total contribution of carbon ¼
Xn
i ¼ 0
imi
,
ðn
Xn
i ¼ 0
miÞ
Here n is the number of C atoms in the metabolite, i the different mass isotopomers
and m the abundance of a certain mass. In the case of lactate supplement, total
pyruvate contribution instead of total glucose contribution is depicted and M þ 3
of a-ketoglutarate from U-13C glutamine was used as a measure for AcCoA
contribution to a-ketoglutarate.
For relative metabolite levels, the total ion count was normalized to the internal
standard norvaline and to cell number counted with an automated cell counter
(Nexcelom).
Isotopomer distributions of fatty acids were further fitted to an isotopic spectral
analysis model previously described5. Isotopic spectral analysis is a non-linear
regression method for fitting the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry data to a
model for biosynthesis with two unknowns, D, the fractional contribution of the
labelled precursor to the biosynthetic precursor pool, and g(t), the fraction of newly
synthesized product present at time t
21,22.
During citrate supplementation, we specifically focus on the ratio between
oxidative and reductive glutamine conversion, because absolute contributions
cannot be inferred because of variations in the label dilution at different amounts of
supplementation. Moreover, high concentrations of unlabelled and residual citrate
from the media prevented the accurate measurement of label in this pool; hence,
the ratio of oxidative versus reductive glutamine utilization was determined from
the measurement of M þ 4 in fumarate, malate and aspartate (oxidative
contribution) and M þ 3 in fumarate, malate and aspartate (reductive contribution)
(Supplementary Fig. S2c).
The net reductive glutamine fluxes to palmitate in the presence or absence of
antimycine, oligomycine or TTFA were calculated as described by Metallo et al.5,
based on the fractional contribution of reductively utilized glutamine and the
fraction of newly synthesized glutamine (D and g(t) from the isotopic spectral
analysis model) combined with cell numbers and growth rates5.
Raw data are depicted in Supplementary Data 1. Error bars are from biological
replicates. We verified for our data set that glutaminolysis, protein turnover and
CO2 refixation can be neglected. This is necessary because glutamiolysis can occur
in mammalian cells32 and CO2 refixation has been shown to be important in
microbes33. Therefore, we analysed M þ 0 from pyruvate on a U-13C glutamine
tracer (significantly altered M þ 0 indicates glutaminolysis), M þ 5 of glutamine
from a U-13C glutamine tracer (significantly altered M þ 5 indicates protein
turnover), and M þ 1 and M þ 2 from a 1-13C glutamine tracer (M þ 2 indicates
CO2 refixation) (Supplementary Fig. S7). In accordance with previous
reports5,34,35, we found that glutaminolysis, protein turnover and CO2 refixation
can be neglected.
NAD þ/NADH ratio. The protocol used to extract NAD þ /NADH from cells was
adapted from a previously described method36. In brief, tissue culture cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and immediately quenched with liquid nitrogen. Cold
extraction solution (  20 C; 40% methanol, 40% acetonitrile, 20% buffer) was
added and plates were incubated at  20 C for 15 min. Cells were scraped on dry
ice and centrifuged at 4 C. The supernatant was collected and the remaining pellet
re-extracted twice with extraction solution. The supernatant was dried and
analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The quenching protocol was
validated by measuring the ATP, ADP and AMP with liquid chromatography–
mass spectrometry. The calculated energy charge was 0.73.
Dried extracts were dissolved in water and separation of compounds was
achieved by HPLC using an Agilent (C8) 2.6  250 mm, 5 mmol l  1 particle
column (Agilent Technologies). The HPLC method was adapted from a published
method37 and verified. Mobile phase flow rate was 1 ml min  1. Eluent A
(50 mmol l  1 potassium phosphate dibasic and 8 mmol l  1 tetrabutylammonium
bisulphate aqueous adjusted to pH 5.8) and eluent B (50 mmol l  1 potassium
phosphate dibasic and 8 mmol l  1 tetrabutylammonium bisulphate aqueous
solution adjusted to pH 5.8 with 40% acetonitrile) were applied with a time￾dependent gradient. Absorbance of NAD was detected at 254 nm wavelength and
NADH was detected at 254 nm and 340 nm. The method was verified with
calibration curves, which are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S8. Error bars are
from biological replicates.
Western blot. PDH and phospo-PDH antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen
or Calbiochem, respectively, and were diluted to 1 or 0.25 mg ml  1, respectively.
Statistics. Error bars depict s.d. R and P-values for the depicted correlations were
calculated with the Matlab integrated function corrcoef: [R,P] ¼ corrcoef returns P,
a matrix of P-values for testing the hypothesis of no correlation. Each P-value is the
probability of getting a correlation as large as the observed value by random
chance, when the true correlation is zero. P-values were also calculated for bar
graphs using a Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unequal variance) to determine whether
two samples are likely to have come from the same two underlying populations that
have the same mean.
