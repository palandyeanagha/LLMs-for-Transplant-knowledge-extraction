REVIEW SERIES: TRANSPLANTATION

Introduction
Solid organ transplantation is a lifesaving, curative therapy for 
patients with end-stage kidney, heart, liver, lung, pancreas, or 
bowel disease. More than 100,000 patients await a transplant 
from the deceased-donor pool in the United States. In 2015, 
30,000 patients received an organ transplant (organdonor.gov; 
ref. 1). Based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net￾work (OPTN) data (February 15, 2017), more than 90% of renal 
allografts in the United States are still functioning by 1 year after 
transplant. However, the lifetime of allografts does not match the 
life expectancy of patients. Twenty percent of recipients will lose 
their graft within 5 years, and 50% within 10 to 12 years. Many 
other organs fare worse; for example, lung allograft survival at 
5 years is only 50% (http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov). More￾over, although the number of patients who need a transplant 
has steadily grown in the last two decades, the number of organ 
donors per year is stagnant (organdonor.gov). Therefore, it is of 
high interest to extend the survival of transplanted solid organs 
and the patients who receive them.
A major driver of organ transplant injury is the alloimmune 
response, predominantly to polymorphic HLA. HLA allosensiti￾zation occurs after exposure to non-self tissue, through pregnan￾cy, cardiac mechanical assist device placement, transfusion, sol￾id organ transplantation, and tissue grafting (e.g., burn patients, 
homograft repair of congenital heart defects, or coronary artery 
bypass graft). The pathogenic role of alloantibodies in solid organ 
transplantation was recognized in the 1960s, when Patel and Tera￾saki (2) seminally showed that donor-specific antibodies, detected 
by cytotoxic crossmatch, were associated with immediate failure 
of renal allografts. Since this era, advances in the detection of anti￾bodies against HLA, the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection 
(AMR), and our knowledge of the mechanisms of antibody-medi￾ated allograft injury have expanded our understanding of AMR.
According to OPTN data, approximately 60% of the US renal 
transplant waitlist is sensitized to HLA, with an overrepresentation 
of women and retransplant candidates. In the post-transplant peri￾od, production of donor-specific antibodies against HLA (DSAs) 
among previously nonsensitized adult renal allograft recipients is 
7% by 5 years (3) and nearly 20% after 10 years (4–6). The incidence 
tends to be higher (up to 40%) in pediatric (7, 8) and medication￾nonadherent adult transplant patients, with the latter consti￾tuting nearly two-thirds of adult transplant patients by 12 years 
after transplantation (6). Post-transplant DSAs are also produced 
by a significant proportion of heart (9), lung (10), liver (11), and 
intestinal transplant recipients (12). Risk factors for de novo DSA 
(dnDSA) production also include recipients of African American 
ethnicity, episodes of acute cell-mediated rejection in the first year 
after transplant (3, 6), donor-recipient mismatching for HLA-DQ 
(3), and pretransplant sensitization to HLA (nondonor) (4).
Patients transplanted with preformed DSAs are at higher risk 
of acute AMR, chronic rejection, and allograft loss across all sol￾id organs (8, 10, 12–22). AMR prevalence among presensitized 
patients is more than 20% (23). Production of dnDSAs after any 
solid organ transplantation is a major risk factor for decreased 
long-term graft survival. By 5 years after the appearance of 
dnDSAs, 40% of patients lose their renal allografts, compared 
with better than 80% survival of patients without DSAs (6). Half 
to all of late allograft failures can be attributed to HLA DSA–
mediated chronic rejection (4, 24–28).
This Review will focus on the clinical impact and mecha￾nisms of AMR mediated by antibodies against classical HLA 
molecules, and discuss the current and emerging therapies to 
prevent and combat AMR.
Manifestations and mechanisms of acute AMR
Acute T cell–mediated rejection typically responds well to increased 
immunosuppression, while AMR is poorly responsive to standard 
therapy. Diagnostic criteria for AMR were first established for renal 
and heart allografts (29, 30), and subsequently for pancreas, liver, 
and lung allografts (31–33). Features of AMR in bowel and vascu￾larized composite tissue allografts (CTAs) have been described 
Solid organ transplantation is a curative therapy for hundreds of thousands of patients with end-stage organ failure. 
However, long-term outcomes have not improved, and nearly half of transplant recipients will lose their allografts by 
10 years after transplant. One of the major challenges facing clinical transplantation is antibody-mediated rejection 
(AMR) caused by anti-donor HLA antibodies. AMR is highly associated with graft loss, but unfortunately there are few 
efficacious therapies to prevent and reverse AMR. This Review describes the clinical and histological manifestations of 
AMR, and discusses the immunopathological mechanisms contributing to antibody-mediated allograft injury as well 
as current and emerging therapies.

lung (33) transplantation. Currently, diagnosis of AMR in cardiac 
allografts does not require this “serological” component (39), but 
it may be reintroduced (40) with the acknowledgement that either 
HLA DSAs or non-HLA antibodies may contribute to AMR.
Detection of HLA antibodies uses a multiplexed assay with 
nearly 200 HLA antigens coupled to fluorescent beads to char￾acterize an individual’s alloantibody repertoire. Extraordinarily 
high levels of pretransplant DSAs (greater than 10,000 median 
fluorescence intensity units [MFI] in our experience), espe￾cially against HLA class I antigens, may be cytotoxic and place 
patients at risk of hyperacute rejection. Patients are more likely 
to experience worse outcomes with stronger pretransplant DSA 
(21, 41). After transplant, DSAs of 2,500–3,000 MFI or above 
at the time of biopsy-proven rejection are associated with worse 
long-term outcome (42, 43) and increased incidence of AMR 
(3). Additionally, the persistence of DSAs is associated with 
worse outcome (19, 44).
(34, 35), but consensus criteria for AMR in these tissues are still 
needed. Although growing evidence shows that antibodies to non￾HLA antigens contribute to allograft dysfunction (36–38), no clear 
diagnostic criteria for non-HLA AMR have been established. Table 
1 provides an overview of the current and proposed consensus cri￾teria for the diagnosis of HLA AMR across solid organs and CTAs. 
Notably, four overarching features form the cornerstone of acute 
AMR diagnosis in transplanted solid organs (Table 1): serological 
evidence of antibodies, histological evidence of endothelial cell 
injury, complement activation, and infiltration of innate immune 
cells. These common features of AMR are discussed below in a 
framework to inform regarding their use for diagnosis, treatment, 
and understanding of the mechanisms of AMR.

HLA IgG subclasses evolve longitudinally 
and correlate with graft pathology in trans￾plant patients.
The human immune response is 
dynamic. Some patients exhibit “natural” 
or false-positive reactivity with recombi￾nant HLA antigens (61), which do not det￾rimentally affect allograft outcome (62). 
On the other hand, patients with a known 
history of sensitization events may not 
exhibit detectable circulating anti-HLA 
antibodies at the time of transplant eval￾uation. This has prompted development 
of alternative methods to measure allore￾activity, including an HLA-specific B cell 
enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) 
(63, 64), ex vivo stimulation of B cells (65, 
66), and staining of peripheral B cells with 
HLA tetramers (67). More work is needed 
to understand the clinical relevance of 
alloreactive memory B cells in the absence 
of circulating HLA DSAs.
Therapies. Nonadherence to mainte￾nance immunosuppression is an important 
risk factor for dnDSA production in a number 
of studies (6, 68), suggesting that T cell inhi￾bition is at least partly efficacious in delaying 
alloantibody formation. However, typical 
maintenance therapies (such as tacrolimus 
or mycophenolate) have little to no known 
effect on memory B cells or plasma cells.
Costimulatory blockade reduces the inci￾dence of dnDSA production. Treatment of 
mice with cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associat￾ed protein-4–Ig (CTLA4-Ig) prevented allo￾antibody production when given in the first 
2 weeks after sensitization (69, 70). Similarly, the CTLA4-Ig fusion 
protein belatacept reduced the risk of dnDSA formation in low-risk 
transplant patients (71). However, once patients present with pre￾formed or de novo HLA antibodies, they become more challenging 
to manage. In combination with i.v. immunoglobulin, which has 
numerous proposed mechanisms of action (72), plasmapheresis 
can be effective at temporarily reducing circulating HLA antibod￾ies. Peripheral B cells can be depleted with rituximab or other anti￾CD20 immunotherapies (73). Eighty percent of highly sensitized 
transplant candidates responded to rituximab-based desensitiza￾tion, enabling transplantation in patients who may otherwise have 
waited longer and possibly died before receiving an organ (74).
Importantly, CD20-directed biologics have little effect on 
the plasma cells responsible for the majority of serum antibodies. 
Peripheral concentrations of IgG are mostly unaltered in patients 
after rituximab treatment, despite depletion of more than 95% of 
circulating B cells (75). Thus, other therapies are needed to target 
the antibody-producing plasma cells within bone marrow niches. 
Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib (76) and carfilzomib 
(77) may more effectively target metabolically active plasma cells. 
On its own, a single dose of bortezomib is insufficient to reduce 
Solid-phase assays to detect HLA antibodies, although quite 
sensitive, may not predict the true pathogenic potential of DSAs. 
Several modifications of the HLA single-antigen test have been 
introduced that may provide useful information on the effector 
function of the DSA. In vitro assays measure binding of C1q (45) 
or deposition of C3d (46) or C4d (47, 48) to single-antigen beads, 
enabling identification of potentially complement-activating 
antibodies as well as their HLA specificity. The prognostic val￾ue of these assays remains controversial (5, 7, 20, 49–52), in part 
because in vitro complement activity appears to be tightly tied to 
antibody titer (20, 44, 53, 54).
Human IgG is composed of four subclasses. The subclass rep￾ertoire is potentially more informative for assessing the pathoge￾nicity of DSAs than complement assays, as subclass predicts com￾plement activation, Fcγ receptor–dependent (FcγR-dependent) 
functions, and the immunobiology of the alloantibody response. 
A growing number of reports suggest that characterization of 
DSA IgG subclass may have utility in identifying patients at risk of 
rejection or graft loss (5, 55–60). While enlightening, these studies 
have yet to capture the impact of mixtures of subclasses or multi￾ple concurrent DSA specificities. It will be interesting to see how 
Figure 1. Current and emerging therapies to prevent HLA antibody production. (A) Naive B cells 
rely on signals from CD4+
 T cells for full activation, Ig class switching, and Ig production. Blockade of 
costimulation using the CTLA4 fusion protein belatacept inhibits this important signal and hampers 
B cell activation. Naive as well as antigen-experienced B cells may be depleted from the circulation 
with antibodies against CD20, such as rituximab. Once HLA antibody–producing B cells have differ￾entiated into plasma cells, they are more difficult to target. Because these antibody “factories” are 
metabolically active and reliant on the function of the proteasome, inhibitors such as bortezomib 
and carfilzomib, which block the 20S proteasome, may trigger apoptosis of these cells. Bortezomib 
is a reversible inhibitor, while carfilzomib is irreversible. Antibodies may also be physically removed 
from the circulation with plasmapheresis, and their effector functions inhibited by intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg). (B) Emerging therapies to reduce alloantibody production include antago￾nism of the IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab), BAFF (belimumab, tabalumab, atacicept), and inhibition of 
intracellular JAK (tofacitinib), which are needed for B cell activation and Ig production. BAFF/APRIL, 
B cell–activating factor/a proliferation-inducing ligand.

sitized kidney transplant patients who had failed desensitization 
with other methods experienced tocilizumab-induced reductions 
in HLA antibodies that facilitated transplant (88). Therefore, IL-6 
antagonism appears useful in restraining HLA antibody produc￾tion in sensitized individuals (Figure 1B), and may also be useful 
as a therapy for chronic AMR (89).
Finally, cytokine signaling in immune cells is dependent on 
intracellular actions of JAKs (Figure 1B). One example is JAK3, 
which is important for activation and Ig production in naive B cells 
(90). Although trials of the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib were halted 
because of adverse events (91), recent reviews have advocated 
reconsideration of the suitability of this and other JAK inhibitors 
in maintenance immunosuppression for transplant (92).
To summarize, there is a need for additional approaches to 
prevent alloantibody generation and more effective therapies to 
specifically deplete DSA-producing B and plasma cells.
Complement deposition
Diagnosis. Figure 2 illustrates the mechanisms of allograft injury 
by HLA donor-specific antibodies, and provides exemplary histo￾logical images of AMR features in cardiac and renal allografts. His￾DSA levels (78), but when bortezomib was combined with plasma￾pheresis and rituximab, 40% of renal transplant candidates with 
DSAs were successfully desensitized (76). Patients who undergo 
desensitization have higher rejection rates (79), but long-term 
outcomes are comparable to those of lower risk patients (80, 81). 
Figure 1A presents the stages at which B cell production of HLA 
antibodies may be targeted.
Tabalumab is an mAb that neutralizes B cell activating factor 
(BAFF/BLyS), a critical B cell factor. Disappointing results from 
clinical trials suggest that, on its own, BAFF antagonism is ineffec￾tive to durably reduce HLA antibody levels (82). However, given 
that higher BAFF levels are associated with greater sensitization 
to HLA (83, 84) and AMR (85), it remains an intriguing therapeutic 
target in the quest for suppressors of HLA antibody production. 
Another BAFF antagonist, atacicept, reduced dnDSA production 
in a nonhuman primate model of renal transplantation (86), and 
belimumab, which showed efficacy in systemic lupus erythe￾matosus (87), is being investigated to reduce pretransplant HLA 
allosensitization (NCT02500251, ClinicalTrials.gov).
Tocilizumab is an mAb antagonist of the IL-6 receptor, which 
is critical in B cell activation and antibody production. Half of sen￾Figure 2. The known mechanisms of HLA 
antibody–mediated allograft injury and their 
therapeutic targets. (A) HLA antibody binding 
to donor endothelial cells can trigger activation 
of the classical complement cascade. First, the 
complement C1 complex, which includes C1q, C1r, 
and C1s, binds to the IgG heavy chain Fc region. 
The C1 complex next sequentially activates serum 
complement proteins, catalyzing the genera￾tion of immunologically active split products. 
Activation of complement C5 protein occurs at 
the terminal stage of the signaling pathway, 
generating the highly potent anaphylatoxin C5a 
and initiating assembly of the membrane attack 
complex (MAC). In the process, the split product 
C4d becomes covalently bound to the endothe￾lial cell surface and can be detected in biopsies 
of allografts undergoing rejection through 
immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical 
staining. Eculizumab is an mAb that prevents C5 
cleavage. HLA binding also activates intracellular 
signaling within the donor endothelium, mainly 
via the mTOR signaling axis, and upregulation 
of the adhesion molecule P-selectin. P-selectin, 
in conjunction with the interaction between 
immune cell Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), enhances leu￾kocyte-endothelial adhesion. PSGL-1, P-selectin

tion (108, 109). These findings suggest that 
upstream complement activation and/or 
non–complement-mediated effector func￾tions mediate allograft damage.
Emerging therapies to suppress activa￾tion of complement include those that act 
at earlier points in the pathway (Figure 3). 
One example is the serum-derived endog￾enous factor C1-INH (Berinert, Cinryze, 
NCT02547220; ref. 110). Alternatively, an 
anti-C1s antibody is in clinical trials for the 
treatment of complement-mediated dis￾eases (NCT02502903). Since the capacity 
of IgG to activate complement depends on 
interaction with C1q via the glycosylated 
CH2 domain in the Fc region, other pos￾sible therapies to attenuate complement￾mediated injury include the Staphylococcus 
aureus enzymes IdeS and EndoS (111–113). 
These enzymes cause cleavage of the Fc tail 
(IdeS) or of the N-linked glycan (EndoS) and abolish complement 
activation in animal models of antibody-mediated inflammation 
(111–114). Clinical trials for desensitization with IdeS are currently 
under way in Europe and the United States (NCT02426684); how￾ever, such approaches are likely to be limited because of (a) risk of 
allergic reaction due to antibody responses against these bacterial 
enzymes, and (b) reconstitution of circulating IgG, which occurs 
in 2–3 weeks. Fc inactivation could be a salvage therapy, but likely 
needs to be combined with effective B cell depletion for durable 
protection of the allograft from DSAs.
In summary, complement activation in the allograft can be 
detected by immunohistochemistry for C4d, which is an import￾ant but not universal feature of AMR. Several established and 
emerging therapeutics exist for antagonism of complement acti￾vation in transplant recipients, but they do not represent a “silver 
bullet,” since there are concurrent, non–complement-mediated 
mechanisms of allograft injury triggered by HLA antibodies.
Intravascular mononuclear cells
Diagnosis. Another key characteristic of AMR across solid organs is 
the presence of intracapillary mononuclear cells (leukocytes) in the 
allograft (Figure 2). While larger vessels may be affected in more 
severe cases of AMR (“arteritis” or “vasculitis”; ref. 42), capillary 
dilatation with inflammatory cell margination with characteristic 
linear staining is a key feature of AMR. Staining for the macro￾phage marker CD68 has been shown to be informative for diag￾nosis of AMR in cardiac allografts (115). Although not included in 
the diagnostic criteria, increased glomerular macrophage burden 
correlates with AMR in renal allografts and is a histological feature 
of acute tissue injury in AMR with or without C4d deposition (30, 
116, 117). The utility of CD68 staining in lung and liver is question￾able. Rather AMR is characterized by a monocytic, neutrophilic, or 
eosinophilic infiltrate in these organs (31, 33, 95, 118), again with 
inflammatory cells adherent to microvascular endothelial cells.
Growing evidence in human and murine transplantation 
shows that other leukocyte subsets play an important role in AMR. 
T lymphocytes may also be found in allografts undergoing AMR 
tological detection of endothelial membrane–associated comple￾ment split product C4d is widely used to provide evidence of DSA 
interaction with the allograft vasculature, first described in refs. 93 
and 94. C4d is a reliable and specific, but not sensitive, marker of 
AMR in heart, kidney, and pancreas allografts when deposited in 
the capillaries. C4d may be nonspecifically positive in larger ves￾sels or the interstitium. In contrast, there is a lack of consensus 
regarding the utility of C4d staining in lung (95–97), visceral, liver, 
and composite tissue transplantation, although it has been recom￾mended in conjunction with other indicators of antibody-mediated 
graft injury (31, 35, 98–100). C4d positivity is considered but not 
required for a diagnosis of AMR in cardiac and renal allografts, and 
C4d detection often misses cases of AMR (101–103).
Mechanisms and therapies. Antibodies interacting with their tar￾gets may activate the classical complement cascade, the initiation 
of which is regulated by the C1 complex that binds to the Fc portion 
of IgG. The complement pathway is a sequential series of amplified 
catalytic events leading to activation of successively more potent 
serum complement factors. The end result of terminal comple￾ment activation is generation of the potent anaphylatoxin C5a and 
formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Even during 
acute AMR, MAC-mediated cell lysis is uncommon. Endothelial 
cells, which are constantly exposed to serum complement factors, 
express a repertoire of cell surface complement regulatory proteins 
(CD59, DAF, Crry) that actively antagonize and limit complement 
activation. Complement activation is also negatively regulated by 
serum factors, such as the serpin C1 esterase (C1-INH).
At sublytic levels, MAC has been shown to activate noncanon￾ical NF-κB signaling in endothelial cells, leading to cytokine and 
adhesion molecule expression (104). Upstream complement com￾ponents such as C3a, C3b, and C5a are physiologically active and 
act on both endothelial cells and leukocytes to enhance inflamma￾tion (105). Eculizumab is a recombinant antibody against comple￾ment C5. Eculizumab may facilitate transplantation across high 
levels of donor-specific antibodies (106) and be effective as sal￾vage therapy for aggressive AMR (107). However, patients treated 
with eculizumab remain at risk of acute AMR and chronic rejec￾Figure 3. Emerging therapies to inhibit HLA antibody–induced allograft injury. Emerging 
therapies for AMR include upstream complement inhibition with C1 esterase (C1-INH) or antibody 
against C1s. DSAs are capable of cross-linking HLA molecules on the donor endothelial and smooth 
muscle cells, resulting in activation of the mTOR signaling axis. Rapamycin (sirolimus) and other 
rapalogs (everolimus) inhibit mTOR and may dampen vascular cell growth and fibrosis, which con￾tributes to chronic rejection. Finally, abolishing Fc-dependent antibody effector functions through 
cleavage of the Fc region with IdeS, or removal of the N-linked glycan with EndoS, is likely to 
hamper activation of the classical complement cascade as well as prevent interactions with FcγRs 
on monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells.

(119). Infiltrating B cells form ectopic lymphoid structures with￾in the allograft and locally secrete HLA antibodies (120, 121). NK 
cells and their associated transcripts are increased in human renal, 
cardiac, and lung allografts during AMR (122–126) and mediate 
acute and chronic AMR in mouse transplant models (127–130).
Mechanisms and therapies. In vitro, HLA I antibodies mobilize 
endothelial vesicles called Weibel-Palade bodies, externalizing 
the adhesion molecule P-selectin (131, 132). Cell surface P-selectin 
expression by endothelial cells in turn supports adhesion of plate￾lets (133), neutrophils (132), and monocytes (131) in vitro and in 
vivo, which likely contributes to the infiltration of recipient immune 
cells. Interactions between endothelial-bound IgG and myeloid cell 
FcγRs can facilitate tethering and adhesion of leukocytes in autoim￾mune inflammation (134) and in response to HLA antibodies (refs. 
135, 136, and Figure 2). Active complement-mediated inflammation 
also promotes recruitment of T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils 
via direct chemotactic effects on immune cells, and by amplifying 
endothelial cell activation (104). Intragraft macrophages have a 
proinflammatory phenotype during acute rejection, and a repair/
profibrotic phenotype during chronic rejection (137), suggesting 
that macrophage effector functions differentially contribute to 
acute and chronic AMR.
NK cells express one receptor for IgG, FcγRIIIA (CD16a), 
which facilitates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxici￾ty against target cells. Stimulation of NK cells through FcγRIIIA 
increased expression of a number of proinflammatory genes in 
vitro that were also validated in biopsies from human renal (138) 
and heart allografts (124) undergoing AMR. IFN-γ production by 
NK cells can be triggered by allogeneic target cells coated with 
alloantibody (139), and contributes to chronic rejection in murine 
models (129). Current immunosuppressive drugs incompletely 
inhibit NK cell–mediated alloreactivity (140).
There are currently no therapies directly aimed at preventing 
recruitment or function of allograft infiltrating leukocytes. It is 
possible that treatment of DSA-positive patients with IdeS and/
or EndoS to cleave the Fc region of circulating IgG might be effi￾cacious in reducing FcγR-mediated monocyte recruitment into 
the allograft (ref. 136 and Figure 3), but this application has yet to 
be tested in the clinic. Although we can conjecture from findings 
in other disease models, it is not clear exactly what intravascular 
macrophages, NK cells, and neutrophils are doing in the allograft 
that contributes to injury. Moreover, the interrelated mechanisms, 
including additive effects, mutual regulation, and feedback, of 
these distinct leukocyte subsets are a complex and fascinating 
issue that remains to be elucidated. Consequently, the functions 
of such innate immune cells, and how they interweave, may rep￾resent new targets of immunosuppressive therapy to treat AMR.
Microvascular inflammation and endothelial 
injury
Diagnosis. Donor endothelial cells are in direct contact with the 
recipient immune system and are the predominant target of the 
alloimmune response. AMR typically manifests in the microvas￾culature of the transplanted organ. Microvascular inflammation 
appears as endothelial cell or cytoplasmic swelling or enlargement 
and vacuolization. In cardiac allografts, staining of endothelial 
cells with CD31 highlights capillaries with endothelial dilation, 
nuclear enlargement, or “swelling” (29, 115). In the lung, capillary 
inflammation was associated with HLA DSAs (96), and in liver, 
endothelial cell hypertrophy and dilatation are noted in the perib￾iliary capillaries and portal microvasculature (31).
HLA antibodies promote activation of intracellular sig￾naling in vitro and in animal models (141–147). Several studies 
have demonstrated that detection of phosphorylated signaling 
molecules that are activated downstream of HLA cross-linking, 
including S6 ribosomal protein and S6 kinase, aids in detection of 
AMR in cardiac allografts (101, 102, 148). Sis and colleagues first 
reported that rejecting renal transplants exhibit increased expres￾sion of endothelial-associated transcripts (149, 150), a finding 
that has been further substantiated by the same group in cardi￾ac allografts (124, 151). Thus, the “molecular microscope” may 
enable pathologists to further distinguish AMR from other forms 
of allograft injury (152), and facilitate a better understanding of 
intragraft changes during AMR, but the field awaits confirmation 
of these studies by other laboratories.
Mechanisms and therapies. Endothelial cell injury and acti￾vation lie at the heart of antibody-mediated allograft damage. 
Extensive in vitro evidence points to an intrinsic role for HLA sig￾naling within the graft vasculature that promotes angiogenic and 
inflammatory responses (Figure 2). For example, cross-linking 
of HLA class I with bivalent antibodies mimics trans interactions 
with T cell receptors, triggering phosphorylation of Src and focal 
adhesion kinases (FAKs), mTOR, ERK, and S6 ribosomal protein 
in endothelial and smooth muscle cells (143, 145, 146). These sig￾naling pathways promote cytoskeletal rearrangements, as well as 
increased wound healing and cell growth (143, 145, 146). Activa￾tion of these signaling molecules during AMR has been substan￾tiated in vivo in a murine model (147) as well as in human cardiac 
allografts (101, 102). Much less is known about the signaling events 
in endothelium after HLA II cross-linking. This is a significant gap 
in our knowledge, since numerous studies have found a strong 
relationship between DSAs against HLA-DQ and chronic rejec￾tion. Exposure of HLA-DR–expressing endothelial cells increased 
ERK and Akt phosphorylation (153), as well as activation of proin￾flammatory Th17 cells (154). More studies are needed to elucidate 
the effect of antibodies against HLA II on vascular endothelial cell 
signaling, and how they contribute to acute and chronic AMR.
Currently, no treatments exist to directly modulate graft vas￾cular function. However, given what is known from experimental 
models and clinical studies, the mTOR signaling axis is activated 
by HLA antibodies and represents a viable therapeutic target to 
dampen endothelial cell activation during AMR (Figure 3).
Allograft dysfunction
AMR manifests as a broad spectrum both histologically and symp￾tomatically. Certainly, AMR identified on for-cause biopsies con￾comitant with overt allograft dysfunction warrants treatment. 
Patients who experience clinically symptomatic AMR and severe 
AMR have significantly worse long-term outcomes compared with 
stable patients or those experiencing other forms of rejection, such 
as acute cell-mediated rejection (155). However, patients may also 
have detectable circulating DSAs but no histological rejection or 
allograft dysfunction. In other cases, DSAs may be present with 
subtle changes on biopsy, but no impairment of function.

Rush et al. first noted subclinical AMR in protocol renal 
allograft biopsies (156), and subsequently there has been increased 
appreciation that patients without overt graft dysfunction may 
exhibit abnormal histology on biopsy of renal (6, 43, 157), cardiac 
(155, 158), and liver (159) allografts. For example, among patients 
who developed dnDSAs but had stable allograft function, 25% 
exhibited acute subclinical AMR and 7.5% had chronic AMR on 
surveillance biopsy (3). One year after dnDSA appearance, these 
patients had further increased incidence of AMR (3). Importantly, 
patients with subclinical AMR experience faster rates of allograft 
function decline, higher incidence of transplant vasculopathy 
(TV), and greater risk of graft loss (6, 21, 43, 160), falling at inter￾mediate risk for graft failure between those without DSAs or dys￾function and those with clinically symptomatic AMR.
Patients treated with plasmapheresis for subclinical AMR had 
no significant difference in their risk of graft loss at 5 years com￾pared with when subclinical AMR was left untreated (21). Taken 
together, these studies provide compelling evidence that patients 
with DSAs but without overt clinical dysfunction are at higher risk 
for graft loss compared with their DSA-negative counterparts. 
Intervention is therefore warranted, particularly when AMR is 
severe (161), but current therapies do not appear efficacious to 
improve long-term outcomes.
Manifestations and mechanisms of chronic AMR 
and TV
Incidence and clinical impact. Repeated injury of the graft vascu￾lature and uncontrolled repair responses contribute to chronic 
rejection (25, 162) that, in many cases, progresses to TV. Thir￾ty percent of heart transplant recipients are diagnosed with TV 
by 5 years after transplant, and 50% by 10 years after transplant 
(163). TV is a leading cause of retransplantation. While nonim￾Table 2. The features of transplant vasculopathy across solid organs and composite tissue allografts

175). Antibodies, NK cells, and complement likely promote endo￾thelial apoptosis, enhancing leukocyte adhesion, matrix remod￾eling and fibrosis, and thrombosis (176). Indeed, in early TV, 
coronary artery endothelia exhibited apoptotic phenotypes (177). 
New evidence shows that apoptotic endothelial microparticles are 
increased in renal transplant recipients with AMR (178), in cardi￾ac allograft recipients with CAV (179), and in lung recipients with 
BOS (180). Such graft-derived exosomes and microvesicles might 
represent an important marker of graft damage, as well as a poten￾tial source of alloantigen.
Endothelial cells exposed to HLA antibodies also elaborate 
IL-8, TNF-α (181), and VEGF (182), which can signal in an auto￾crine fashion or act on smooth muscle cells in a paracrine manner. 
Complement activation at the endothelial surface can enhance 
these processes leading to intimal expansion by acting direct￾ly on endothelial cells and augmenting adhesion of leukocytes 
(104), although in murine models complement deficiency did not 
impact TV (127).
In vivo studies using T cell– and B cell–deficient murine 
recipients passively transferred with anti-donor MHC I anti￾bodies demonstrated that DSAs triggered vascular lesions in 
cardiac allografts reminiscent of TV in humans (127, 129). This 
model has identified a key role for NK cells, IFN-γ, and Fas/FasL￾mediated injury in the process of DSA-induced TV (127, 183). An 
alternative model using passive transfer of anti-HLA antibod￾ies and human T cells into murine recipients of human arterial 
grafts demonstrated that CD4+
 T cells also infiltrate the neointi￾ma and produce IFN-γ (104).
No treatment options reverse TV once established. Use of 
statins is encouraged because of a substantial survival benefit and 
significantly lower incidence of CAV (184, 185). In addition, mTOR 
inhibitors reduce neointimal thickening in animal models and in 
human transplantation (186–188). This is likely partly attributable 
to general antiproliferative properties, since mTOR inhibitors also 
reduce neointimal hyperplasia in other vascular injury models 
(189). We have proposed that mTOR inhibition may also amelio￾rate progrowth signaling in the vasculature triggered by HLA anti￾bodies (143). Recently, antibody-mediated TV in murine recip￾ients capable of mounting a de novo antibody response against 
renal allografts was reported (190). This breakthrough holds 
promise to elucidate the physiological processes driving chronic 
allograft injury by alloantibodies, including the independent and 
interrelated contributions of complement, endothelial signaling, 
and different leukocyte subsets.
Conclusions
The mechanisms of HLA antibody–mediated allograft injury 
are manifold, and manifest as universal histological features 
across all transplanted solid organs. AMR is characterized by 
circulating DSAs or non-HLA antibodies, evidence of com￾plement deposition, microvascular inflammation with leuko￾cyte infiltration, and endothelial injury. Repeated injury of the 
allograft culminates in TV, with fibrosis and neointimal expan￾sion in larger vessels. The arsenal of therapies to combat AMR 
and chronic rejection is growing, but today’s treatments do not 
address all of the components of antibody-mediated injury. In 
particular, the intracellular signaling pathways leading to endo￾mune factors also contribute to TV, the majority of renal allograft 
loss due to chronic rejection was associated with HLA DSAs (24, 
164). Chronic rejection is also an important cause of late failure 
of vascularized CTA (165, 166). Similarly, chronic damage and TV 
in heart (25), lung (95, 167, 168), pancreas (169), and liver (11, 28, 
170) allografts are more common among patients with a history of 
biopsy-proven AMR and HLA DSAs.
Only half of renal allografts were functioning within 18 
months of diagnosis of chronic AMR (164). Median survival 
time of lung allografts after diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliter￾ans syndrome (BOS) is less than 3 years (171). TV accounts for 
one-third of cardiac allograft recipient deaths late after trans￾plant (163). Therefore, chronic rejection culminating in TV is 
currently an irreversible process with significant impact on 
patient morbidity and mortality.
Chronic AMR occurs late (more than 1 year) after transplant 
but exhibits many of the features characteristic of acute AMR in 
each organ, including endothelial cell changes, microvascular 
inflammation, C4d, and circulating donor-specific antibodies. In 
addition, fibrosis is an important characteristic of chronic AMR 
(31, 172). For example, transplant glomerulopathy is a feature of 
chronic AMR in renal allografts, with duplication of the basement 
membrane in the glomerulus and peritubular capillaries (173).
Allografts with TV suffer from neointimal expansion and 
fibrosis in the larger vessels, which is largely considered a mani￾festation or consequence of chronic AMR. TV may be missed on 
routine biopsy owing to its predominant involvement of larger 
vessels that are not often observed except on deep tissue sam￾ples. For example, in the heart, cardiac allograft vasculopathy 
(CAV) is detected by imaging such as intravascular ultrasound 
or histologically only upon explant. CAV appears as arterioscle￾rotic lesions with inflammatory neointimal hyperplasia that can 
be clearly distinguished from eccentric atherosclerotic plaques 
(25). Intimal thickening may be so severe as to fully occlude the 
affected vasculature. Similarly, arteriopathy of kidney trans￾plants is a consequence of intimal fibrosis and expansion in the 
renal arteries. An overview of the features of TV across organs 
and CTA is provided in Table 2.
Mechanisms and therapies. Although clinical evidence strong￾ly supports the association between chronic AMR, TV, and HLA 
DSAs in numerous solid organs, the precise mechanisms by which 
neointimal proliferation and fibrosis occur are unclear. In part, 
this is because it is difficult to model this process in vitro, and 
there has been a historical lack of an appropriate animal model. 
Multiple other mechanisms contribute to TV, including chronic T 
cell–mediated injury and viral and/or metabolic risk factors, but 
HLA antibodies are both a major risk factor and a probable caus￾ative agent for chronic vascular changes. Our group and others 
have demonstrated in in vitro models that HLA antibodies trigger 
prosurvival and proliferative intracellular signaling via ERK and 
mTOR in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, promoting 
growth, cytoskeletal changes, and migration (131, 141–147). Phos￾phorylation of these signaling molecules has been substantiated 
in AMR in both mouse and human allografts (102, 147, 148). HLA 
I antibodies also elicit matrix metalloprotease– and sphingolipid￾mediated signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, which are 
thought to contribute to the intimal hyperplasia seen in TV (174,

thelial dysfunction and recruitment of leukocytes have yet to 
be effectively targeted. AMR also presents as a continuum of 
histological and clinical features. Advancing toward precision 
medicine in transplantation will require an understanding that 
each patient may need a different, combinatorial approach to 
prevent and alleviate AMR. Along these lines, improving the 
organ allocation system to favor HLA or HLA epitope matching 
or avoiding specific epitope mismatches that are highly immu￾nogenic holds promise to reduce allosensitization and improve 
graft and patient outcomes (191). This strategy would be par￾ticularly useful in children, who will likely require two or more 
transplants during their lifetime.
