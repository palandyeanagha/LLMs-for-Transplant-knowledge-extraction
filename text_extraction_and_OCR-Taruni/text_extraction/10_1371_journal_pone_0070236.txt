Abstract
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
after lung transplantation. Reports from clinical and rodent models suggest the implication of IL-17A in either PGD or
BO. We took advantage of the heterotopic trachea transplantation model in mice to study the direct role of IL-17A in
post-transplant airway lesions. Across full MHC barrier, early lesions were controlled in IL-17A-/- or anti-IL17 treated
recipients. In contrast, IL-17A deficiency did not prevent subsequent obliterative airway disease (OAD). Interestingly,
this early protection occurred also in syngeneic grafts and was accompanied by a decrease in cellular stress, as
attested by lower HSP70 mRNA levels, suggesting the involvement of IL-17A in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).
Furthermore, persistence of multipotent CK14+ epithelial stem cells underlined allograft protection afforded by IL-17A
deficiency or neutralisation. Recipient-derived γδ+
 and CD4+
 T cells were the major source of IL-17A. However,
lesions still occurred in the absence of each subset, suggesting a high redundancy between the innate and adaptive
IL-17A producing cells. Notably, a double depletion significantly diminished lesions. In conclusion, this work
implicated IL-17A as mediator of early post-transplant airway lesions and could be considered as a potential
therapeutic target in clinical transplantation.

Introduction
Lung transplantation remains the only therapeutic approach
for end-stage lung failure. Although immunosuppressive
regimens efficiently control acute rejection [1], two main
problems impact recipients’ survival. On the one hand, primary
graft dysfunction (PGD) that occurs during the immediate
postoperative period is caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury
(IRI), and affects up to 25% of the recipients [2]. Clinically
equivalent to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
PGD is accompanied with an alteration in the PaO2
/FiO2
ratio
that may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
support and remains the major cause of early postoperative
morbidity and mortality [2]. Indeed, severe PGD is associated
with up to 40% mortality 30-day after transplantation [3]. On the
other hand, chronic rejection, namely the bronchiolitis
obliterans (OB), is a fibroproliferative disease affecting the
small airways. OB leads to an irreversible decline in lung
function and accounts for more than 50% of lung allograft
failures occurring within 5 years following transplantation [4].
Although no causal relationship linking PGD to OB has been
demonstrated, some authors have shown that PGD is
associated with a greater risk of OB [5], and histopathologic
reports indicate that both inflammation and injury precede an
aberrant tissue repair and epithelial regeneration that leads to
the fibrous obliteration of the small airways occurring during OB
[6].
Production of IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in
autoimmune and infectious diseases, has been observed after
heart and kidney transplantation during both IRI [7,8] and graft
rejection [9,10]. In lung transplanted patients experiencing PGD
or chronic rejection, high amounts of IL-17A were found in the
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) suggesting its involvement in
lung PGD and OB respectively [11,12]. In rodents, studies
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70236

demonstrated a pathogenic role of IL-17A in an in situ lung IRI
model [13] and in the generation of OB after lung
transplantation across minor MHC mismatch [14]. However, the
relative importance of IL-17A mediated tissue damages during
the chronological stages of transplant rejection remains poorly
understood in case of MHC mismatches. Indeed, cells from
both innate (γδ+
, NK cells, neutrophils) and adaptive immunity
(CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells) can produce IL-17A and may
therefore generate graft lesions at different time points after
transplantation [15].
Herein, we used the heterotopic trachea transplantation
(HTT) model described by Hertz et al. [16] in which syngeneic
and fully allogeneic tracheas undergo an initial epithelial injury
[17]. Subsequently, the syngeneic organs rapidly heal and
recover a normal structure by day 28 [17,18]. In contrast, the
allogeneic grafts develop an obliterative airway disease (OAD)
considered an experimental equivalent of BO. Altogether, this
model allowed us to decipher the role of IL-17A in early and
advanced post-transplant airway lesions.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Wild type C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice were purchased from
Harlan, Netherlands. IL-17A-/- C57BL/6 mice were kindly
provided by Dr Iwakura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan).
γδTCR-/- C57BL/6 mice were kindly provided by Dr. F. Huaux,
Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium. Eight to
twelve weeks old animals were used and animals were bred in
our specific pathogen-free animal facility. All animals received
humane care in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory
Animal Care formulated by the National Institute of Health
(Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Eighth
Edition, National Research Council, 2010) and protocols were
approved by the Ethical Committee from the Biopole ULB
Charleroi (agreement # LA2500519).
Heterotopic trachea transplantation
Heterotopic trachea transplantation (HTT) was performed
according to an adaptation of the method of Hertz [16]. Briefly,
donor mice were euthanized in 100% CO2
. Donor hearts and
lungs were then exposed via a midline incision through the skin
and peritoneum extending through the rib cage and sternal
notch. Thymus tissue was dissected away. The trachea was
separated from the esophagus by blunt dissection, excised
from the first tracheal ring to the main bronchi and placed in
0.9% sodium chloride until transplantation. Recipient mice were
anaesthetized with a mixture of xylazine (Rompun) 5% and
ketamine 10% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After
shaving a surface of 0.5cm x 0.5cm over the scapula, a 3mm
incision was made through the dermis and a 1.5cm x 1.5cm
pouch was created by blunt dissection over the posterior upper
back area. One trachea was placed in each pouch. When
recipients were co-transplanted, syngeneic and allogeneic
tracheas were grafted on opposite flanks. Skin was then closed
with 5/0 silk suture. The time between harvesting and
transplantation never exceeded 15 minutes. Recipient mice
were monitored until full recovery and then every day until
sacrifice. At the time of harvesting, recipient mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation and grafts were removed by
blunt dissection.
Antibody treatments
When specified, recipients received neutralizing or depleting
antibody injections. 300µg of the neutralizing anti-IL17A (clone
MM17F3) or isotype control (clone CRL16.67, both kindly
provided by Dr. C. Uyttenhove, Ludwig Institute for Cancer
Research, Brussels, Belgium) was intraperitoneally (IP)
injected, starting the day of transplantation and followed by two
injections per week after transplantation. 500µg of the depleting
anti-CD4 cocktail (clones YTS191 and YTA 3.1.2) or isotype
control (clone YCATE) kindly provided by Dr. S. Cobbold, Sir
Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University, UK) was IP
injected on days 0, 2 and 4 after trachea transplantation. A
single dose of 300 µg of the depleting anti-gammadelta T cells
(clone UC7-13D5) or control isotype (clone PARSI 19) was
administered IP 7 days before transplantation. Double-depleted
animals were treated with both antibodies together. Depletion
efficiency was measured by flow cytometry on draining lymph
node cells at the time of harvest and reached >95% for both
subsets.
Histopathology
Grafts were harvested at 5, 8 and 28 days after
transplantation. Cross-sectional specimens were fixed in 4%
formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5µm￾thickness and stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Masson’s
trichrome and PAS. All specimens were examined in blind
fashion and scored as previously described [19]. For lumenal
occlusion assessment, Masson’s trichrome stained sections
were photographed at x40 magnification using a Nikon
DXM1200F camera on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. Images
were then analyzed with Zeiss AxioVision 4.7 software and
surface from the tracheal cartilage and the free lumen were
measured. Residual free lumen was calculated as follows: (free
lumen/surface at cartilage) x 100. Results are expressed as
percentages.
Immunostaining
Five µm paraffin sections were cut, deparaffinized and
rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was first quenched
by H2O2
 peroxidase blocking reagent (DakoCytomation). For
CK14+
 epithelial stem cells staining, sections were then
incubated with 1/100 diluted anti-CK14 antibody (clone LL002,
Novocastra, UK) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Sections
were then washed and incubated with 1/500 diluted goat anti￾rabbit antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA)
for 20 minutes at room temperature (RT). For neutrophil
staining, sections were then incubated with 1/50 diluted anti–
Ly-6G Ab (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 30 min at RT.
Sections were then washed and incubated with 1/500 diluted
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) for
30 min at RT. Thereafter, streptavidin-HRP was added and
coloration was revealed using diaminobenzidine (DAB) with the
substrate chromogen system from Dakocytomation. Two
independent operators counted positive cells. For CK14+ cells,

3 systematic non-overlapping fields at the ×200 magnification
were considered for each tracheal graft. For neutrophils, all
Ly-6G+
 cells on one section were counted.
RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from trachea transplants using the
MagnaPure LC RNA Isolation Kit III for tissue (Roche
Diagnostics) according to manufacturers’ instructions. Reverse
transcription and real-time PCR were performed using
LightCycler-RNA Master Hybridization Probes (one-step
procedure) on a Lightcycler 480 apparatus (Roche
Diagnostics). Beta-Actin was used as RNA loading control. The
primers were custom ordered from Eurogentec as follows: IL-6,

HSP70 primers were purchased as ready-made mix from
Applied Biosystems (cat# Mm03038454_S1). Graft mRNA

Flow Cytometry and graft-infiltrating cell isolation
To isolate graft-infiltrating lymphocytes (GILs), harvested
tracheas were minced and incubated at 37°C for 100 minutes
with type I collagenase at 2 mg/mL (Sigma) in a phosphate
buffered solution. Intracytoplasmic staining was then performed
after cell incubation with 50 ng/mL PMA and 500 ng/mL
ionomycin for 4 h with brefeldin A (10 µg/mL) in the last 2
hours; then the cells were incubated for 10 minutes with Fc
block, stained for surface markers for 20 minutes, washed with
Phosphate Buffer Saline/Bovine Serum Albumin 0.1%/NaN
30.01%, fixed with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD Biosciences),
permeabilized with Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) and
labelled with anti-IL17A antibody. Cytometry analysis was
performed on a CyAn-LX cytometer using Summit 4.1 software
(DakoCytomation).

Results
IL-17A deficiency does not prevent OAD
Heterotopic trachea transplantation (HTT) was performed as
described by Hertz et al. [16]. We first addressed the effect of
IL-17A on the development of post-transplant obliterative
airways disease (OAD). Therefore, fully allogeneic BALB/C
tracheas were grafted into C57BL/6 WT or IL-17A-/- recipients.
Animals were sacrificed at day 28 post-transplantation.
Pathologic score was based on four easily identifiable
processes: leukocyte infiltration, loss of the pseudostratified
airway epithelial architecture, subepithelial fibrosis, and luminal
obliteration due to granulation tissue formation and/or fibrosis,
as described in materials and methods. We found that IL-17A
deficiency had no final impact on obliterative lesions as grafts
harvested from IL-17A-/- recipients exhibited the same
pathologic score as observed in grafts from WT recipient mice
(Figure 1A). Indeed, the respiratory epithelium vanished in both
groups and leukocyte infiltration was comparable. Dense
collagen deposits enlarged the lamina propria, thickened the
basal membrane and obstructed the lumen (Figure 1B & D). To
confirm these results, we also compared lumenal obstruction
(as described in materials and methods). We found no
differences between WT and IL-17A-/- recipients, which
displayed 66 ± 10% vs 71 ± 10% obstruction, respectively
(Figure 1C). A network of neovessels underlined these fibro￾obliterative processes. IL-17A deficiency alone is thus
ineffective in preventing late rejection of fully allogeneic trachea
transplants.
IL-17A deficiency prevents early allograft lesions
Because IL-17A can be involved in early inflammatory
mechanisms, we next assessed the impact of IL-17A deficiency
in early post-transplant lesions. To this aim, BALB/C tracheas
were transplanted into WT or IL-17A-/- C57BL/6 recipients for 8
days. As shown in Figure 2A, grafts harvested from IL-17A-/-
recipients showed significantly fewer lesions compared to
grafts from WT recipients. Indeed, protected organs retained a
pseudostratified epithelial architecture and showed little
collagen deposits, in contrast to grafts from WT recipients
which developed epithelial flattening, basal membrane
thickening and subepithelial fibrosis (Figure 2 B). Grafts from
IL-17A-/- recipients also preserved a substantial number of
CK14+
 basal epithelial stem cells, which are capable of
renewing the whole epithelium after injury [20] (Figure 2 C and
D). In contrast, these cells nearly completely vanished in grafts
from WT recipients. These experiments demonstrate that
IL-17A is implicated in early post-transplant airway lesions.

IL-17A neutralisation prevents early post-transplant
lesions independently of allorecognition
In order to assess the role of IL-17A in the inflammation
resulting from the surgical procedure, we performed
experiments in syngeneic condition. To confirm our previous
results and to rule out a possible strain effect, allogeneic
tracheas were grafted on the same recipient background. Anti￾IL17 or control antibody-treated BALB/C mice were thus
transplanted with a syngeneic BALB/C trachea on the left flank

and an allogeneic C57BL/6 trachea on the right flank. Because
C57BL/6 organs are more sensitive to IRI than BALB/C [21], all
grafts were harvested after 5 days. Although data
demonstrated increased IL‑17A mRNA in allografts compared
with syngeneic transplants (Figure S1A), we found that
syngeneic grafts harvested from anti-IL17 treated animals had
fewer lesions compared to control antibody treated animals
(Figure 3A). Indeed, grafts from treated animals preserved a
pseudostratified epithelium and showed little cellular infiltration
in the lamina propria whereas control antibody treated grafts
experienced epithelial flattening and basal membrane
thickening (Figure 3B). IL-17A blockade controlled neutrophil
recruitment, as demonstrated after specific anti-Ly6G
immunostaining (Figure 3C). The intragraft IL-6 mRNA
expression was also lower in the context of IL-17A blockade
(Figure 3D). Furthermore, we demonstrated that IL-17A
blockade controlled cellular stress, as attested by a reduction
of HSP70 mRNA levels in grafts harvested from anti-IL17
treated animals compared to control animals (Figure 3E).
Interestingly, we observed similar numbers of CK14+ basal
cells in both groups (Figure 3F). As shown in Figure 4A, IL-17A
blockade also controlled early post-transplant lesions in
allogeneic tracheas. Similarly to the syngeneic condition, this
treatment prevented the recruitment of neutrophils (Figure 4C)
 and significantly decreased IL-6 and HSP70 mRNA expression
(Figure 4D & E). In contrast to the syngeneic condition, this
treatment prevented the destruction of CK14+
 basal epithelial
stem cells. Further cytokine analysis revealed that IL‑17A
blockade increased graft IL‑1β and IFN-γ mRNA levels only in
the allogeneic condition, whereas TNF-α remained unaffected
(Figure S1B, C and D). As IL-17A inhibition prevented lesions
in syngeneic as well as allogeneic conditions, these results
indicate that IL-17A is a crucial inflammatory mediator in early
post-transplant lesions independently of allorecognition.
Recipient-derived γδ+
 and CD4+
 T cells are codominant
sources of IL-17A
To characterize the intragraft cellular sources of IL-17A, we
transplanted BALB/C tracheas into C57BL/6 recipients for 8
days and analysed the graft-infiltrating cells by flow cytometry.
C57BL/6 MHC-I H-2Kb
 specific staining revealed that the
majority of the IL-17A-producing cells were recipient-derived
(Figure 5A). We observed that γδ+
 and αβ+
 T cells represented
around 65% and 30% of these cells, respectively (Figure 5B).
NK1.1+ cells abundantly infiltrated the grafts but did not secrete
IL-17A (Figure S2). Further analysis demonstrated that the
majority of IL-17A producing αβ+
 cells were CD4+
 in contrast to
Figure 3. IL-17A blockade prevents early post-transplant airway lesions in syngeneic grafts. Syngeneic BALB/C tracheas

the CD8+
 counterpart (Figure 5C). Finally, we found that γδ+
and αβ+
IL-17A+
 cells had a similar expression of the
chemokine receptor CCR6, which is considered specifically
expressed on tissue-recruited IL-17A producing cells [15]
(Figure 5D).
We next addressed the contribution of each type of IL-17A
producing population in our model. B6 recipients of BALB/C
tracheas were depleted of CD4+
 and γδ+
 T cells either together
or separately, as described in materials and methods. As
shown in Figure 5E, the lesions were significantly reduced
when both subsets were depleted together. However, single
depletions of γδ+
 T cells or CD4+
 T cells did not prevent lesion
occurrence. These results demonstrate that γδ+
 and CD4+ T
cells represent the major IL-17A producing cells recruited to the
grafts. This also suggests that each IL-17A producing subset
can be autonomously pathogenic.
Discussion
Primary graft dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans are the
leading causes of morbidity and mortality after lung
transplantation. Taking advantage of the HTT model in IL-17A-/-
mice, we demonstrated a dominant role of IL-17A in early but
not late post-transplant airway lesions. Representing a clinically
applicable treatment [22], IL-17A blockade also afforded
protection. Interestingly, the protective effect of IL-17A
neutralization was observed in both allogeneic and syngeneic
conditions, although IL‑17A mRNA levels were much higher in
allografts compared with syngeneic transplants. In both cases,
the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment to the grafts and the
decrease in IL-6 mRNA levels confirmed the impairment of two
IL-17A inflammatory downstream mediators implicated in IRI
[23,24]. In addition, IL-17A blockade reduced cellular stress as
attested by the reduction of HSP70 mRNA levels [25]. In line
with this, IL-17A has recently been shown to mediate ischemia￾induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis [8]. Our results are in
accordance with previous reports demonstrating a role for
IL-17A in kidney, liver and lung IRI models in which there is no
alloantigen [7,13,26]. In addition, anti-IL17A treatment also
reduced the lesions in fully MHC-mismatched allografts. In this
setting, IL-17A neutralization allowed the persistence of CK14-
expressing airway basal cells witnessing an important feature
for epithelial protection. Indeed, these are epithelial stem cells
capable of renewing the whole epithelium after injury [20].
Noteworthy, CK14+
 cells were not affected in the syngeneic
condition meaning that epithelial cells are primary allogeneic
targets [27]. This difference between the syngeneic and
allogeneic conditions strongly suggests there is a synergy of

alloantigen-dependent and allo-independent mechanisms of
tissue injury.
Innate and adaptive immunity participate in IRI [28]. Cells
from both systems can secrete IL-17A [15]. Accordingly,
previous reports demonstrated the role of IL-17A producing
NKT cells [13] or indirectly implicated Th17 in lung IRI after in
situ hilar occlusion [29]. In cardiac IRI, γδ+
 T cells produced
IL-17A [8]. In our transplant model, H-2Kb
 expression on
intragraft lymphocytes demonstrated that virtually all IL-17A
producing cells were recipient-derived graft infiltrating cells.
Moreover, we found that γδ+
 T cells and CD4+
 T cells, which
represent the majority of IL-17A-producing cells, highly
expressed CCR6. This chemokine receptor has already been
efficiently blocked in a model of rheumatoid arthritis [30] and
could therefore represent a potential therapeutic target in IRI.
Besides, NK1.1-expressing cells abundantly infiltrated the
grafts but did not secrete IL-17A. Although γδ+
 T cells have
been described as stress sensors [31] and played a central role
in cerebral IRI [32], tracheas from γδ-depleted or γδ-deficient
(data not shown) recipients were not protected against post￾transplant IRI. Similarly, depletion of CD4+
 T cells did not
prevent lesions, contrasting with the results from Yang et al.
[29]. Concomitant depletion of regulatory T cells may explain
this phenomenon [28]. Furthermore, CD4+
 T cells have been
implicated in recovery mechanisms following hind limb IRI [33].
These results implied some redundancy between the innate
and adaptive IL-17A producing T cell subsets in mediating
early post-transplant lesions, which was confirmed by the
beneficial impact of a combined depletion of both subsets.
Interestingly, IL-17A blockade significantly increased IL‑1β
and IFN-γ mRNA production only in allografts and not in
syngeneic condition. Nevertheless, the role of these cytokines
in our early model remains undetermined. Besides, in a model
of late fibro-obliterative airway lesions, we recently showed that
IFN-γ deficiency enhanced graft damages, supporting an
unexpected regulatory role of the cytokine [18]. Further
investigations are required to address the complex regulation
of these cytokines in the development of early lesions [34].
Our data suggest that IL-17A blockade could represent a
novel therapeutic approach for PGD after transplantation but
perhaps also in other detrimental conditions such as pulmonary
embolism, ARDS or pulmonary hypertension [35]. Because this
work focused on the role of IL-17A, we could not rule out a
potential effect for the homologous IL-17F. Indeed, cells
producing IL-17A also secrete IL-17F, which both bind the
IL-17 receptor as homodimers or heterodimers [36]. Though
their structural relationship would suggest similar pro￾inflammatory properties, IL‑17F has been shown to rather

regulate inflammatory responses [37]. Deciphering the role of
IL-17F in solid organ transplantation requires further
experiments.
We found no effect of IL-17A deficiency in the development
of late lesions of OAD in fully MHC mismatched organs. In
contrast, IL-17A blockade could prevent BO in an orthotopic
lung transplantation model across minor MHC mismatch [14].
The discrepancies in allogeneic mismatches may explain these
results. Indeed, using various skin graft models, we have
previously shown that IL17-mediated allograft rejection only
occurred in the context of minor antigenic mismatch [38].
Recent data from bleomycin-induced lung injury demonstrated
an early IL-17A mediated pulmonary inflammation leading to
fibrosis [39,40]. In our post-transplant OAD model, though
affording early protection, IL-17A deficiency did not prevent
fibrosis, confirming the existence of multiple overlapping fibrotic
pathways [41]. In addition, sustained allorecognition of multiple
MHC disparities may lead to IFN-γ producing Th1 cells and
CTL responses which might hide the early IL-17A-dependent
mechanisms [42].
In conclusion, our work demonstrated the direct implication
of IL-17A as a pro-inflammatory mediator of early post￾transplant airway lesions, which could represent a therapeutic
target for prevention of PGD in clinical transplantation.
