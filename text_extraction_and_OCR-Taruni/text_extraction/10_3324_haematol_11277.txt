ABSTRACT
Background
The possibility of performing syngeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is rare and there
are concerns about the absence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect following such a strategy. We
report the outcomes of a large series of adult patients who underwent syngeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation for acute myeloblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Design and Methods
The outcomes of all syngeneic transplants for acute myeloblastic or lymphoblastic leukemia
reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry were analyzed;
a study of prognostic factors was performed for those transplanted in first complete remission.
Results
One hundred and sixty-two patients, 109 with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 53 with acute lym- phoblastic leukemia, were identified; 116 were in first complete remission. Most of the patients
did not receive prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. Nineteen patients developed acute
graft-versus-host disease and only three patients developed chronic graft-versus-host disease.The
median follow-up was 60 months. At 5 years the non-relapse mortality was 8±5%, the relapse
incidence 49±8% and the leukemia-free survival 43±3%. The corresponding figures for patients
in first complete remission were 7±2%, 40±4% and 53±5% at 5 years.Analysis of patients in first
complete remission showed that the number of courses of chemotherapy required to induce first
complete remission was the main risk factor: the leukemia-free survival at 5 years was 66±6%
when first complete remission was reached after one induction course of chemotherapy and was
only 20±9% when first complete remission was reached after at least two induction courses of
chemotherapy (p=0.0001); the relapse incidence was 30±6% and 54±10%, respectively
(p=0.007).
Conclusions
Outcomes were better for patients transplanted in first complete remission than in second com￾plete remission or a more advanced phase of the disease. When a syngeneic donor is available
for patients with high risk acute leukemia, allotransplantation should be performed as soon as
the first complete remission has been achieved, ideally with one course of chemotherapy.
Key words: acute leukemia, syngeneic transplantation.

Introduction
Treatment of acute leukemia includes allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a
family member or an unrelated donor. The possibility
of performing HSCT from an identical twin donor, i.e.,
a syngeneic donor, is rare. Indeed the last 2005 activi￾ty survey of the European Group for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) on HSCT indicated
that, of a total of 8890 allogeneic transplants, 4702
were done from a related HLA identical donor, 514
from a related HLA non-identical donor, 3617 from an
unrelated donor and only 57 (0.64%) from a twin
donor.1 It was previously reported that syngeneic
HSCT was associated with a low non-relapse mortali￾ty but with a high relapse incidence.2,3 This was cor￾roborated by an International Bone Marrow
Transplantation Registry (IBMTR) comparative study
showing that after allogeneic bone marrow transplan￾tation for early leukemia the highest relapse incidence
was observed after syngeneic transplants and the low￾est after unmanipulated bone marrow transplants
when graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was diag￾nosed.4 These observations were the demonstration of
an immunological effect after allogeneic bone marrow
transplants but were not in favor of a possible graft￾versus-leukemia effect after syngeneic HSCT.
However, proven GVHD is observed after approxi￾mately 10% of syngeneic HSCT, indicating that a syn￾geneic graft-versus-leukemia effect may exist. Indeed,
efforts have been made to identify factors that could
influence the occurrence of a syngeneic graft-versus￾leukemia effect such as nucleated cell dose in the graft5
and parity.

In this study we report the largest series of syngene￾ic HSCT for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults, all reported to
the EBMT registry by European teams. 
Design and Methods 
Patients 
Adult patients (over 16 years old) undergoing HSCT
from a syngeneic identical twin for AML or ALL were
selected from the Acute Leukaemia Working Party reg￾istry of the EBMT over a period of 30 years from
January 1975 to December 2003 (median year: 1994);
72% of patients were transplanted after January 1990.
The selected patients were reported to the EBMT by 86
European teams. All patients had de novo acute
leukemia. A total of 162 eligible patients who received
a syngeneic HSCT were selected for the study. All
patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. 
Statistical analysis and end-points
A descriptive analysis was performed for all patients
and patients transplanted in first complete remission.
Prognostic analyses were restricted to the subgroup of
adult patients transplanted in first complete remission,
constituting the only homogeneous subgroup with a
number of patients (n=116) sufficient for a multivariate
analysis.
The primary end-point of the study was to deter￾mine the outcome defined as time to death or relapse,
non-relapse mortality and leukemia-free survival.
Variables considered were recipient age, sex, disease
characteristics (type of leukemia, cytogenetics, white
blood cell count at diagnosis, cytomegalovirus serolo￾gy), donor characteristics (cytomegalovirus serology),
time from diagnosis to first remission, number of
induction courses to reach first remission, disease sta￾tus at transplant (first complete remission, second
complete remission or more advanced disease); trans￾plant characteristics (source of stem cells, dose of
nucleated cells infused, conditioning regimen including
total body irradiation or not, GVHD prophylaxis and
year of transplant)
Cumulative incidence curves were used in a compet￾ing risk setting, since death and relapse are competing
events.7 Probabilities of leukemia-free survival were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate; the log￾rank test was used for univariate comparisons. 
In the population of patients allografted in first
remission, associations of graft characteristics with
outcomes were evaluated in multivariate analyses,
using Cox proportional hazards for leukemia-free sur￾vival and survival, and the proportional sub-distribu￾tion hazard regression model of Fine and Gray for
other outcomes.8 A stepwise backward procedure was
used to construct a set of independent predictors for
each end-point. All predictors with a p value below
0.10 were considered, and sequentially removed if the
p value in the multiple model was above 0.05. All tests
were two-sided. The type I error rate was fixed at 0.05
for determination of factors associated with time to
event outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS (Inc., Chicago) and Splus (MathSoft, Inc,
Seattle) software packages.
Results
Disease and patient characteristics 
Table 1 lists the disease, patient and transplant char￾acteristics. Overall 162 patients were analyzed: 109
with AML and 53 with ALL. The median age of the
whole population was 36 years old (range, 16-68 years
old). One hundred and sixteen patients were trans￾planted in first complete remission, 21 in second com￾plete remission and 25 in a more advanced stage of dis￾ease. Information on cytogenetics at diagnosis was
available for 78/162 patients comprising 59 with AML
and 25 with ALL. According to the South-Western
Oncology Group (SWOG) classification,9 eight AML
patients were in the favorable prognostic group, 47
patients were in the intermediate group and four
patients were in the unfavorable group. Among the
ALL group no abnormality was observed in 16
patients, whereas cytogenetic abnormalities were
reported for nine patients: two patients with t(4;11)
and seven with t(9;22). One patient had a detectable
bcr-abl transcript fusion without a detectable t(9;22).

Disease and patient characteristics of patients 
with acute leukemia transplanted in first complete
remission
One hundred and sixteen patients were transplanted
in first complete remission. Table 1 lists the disease,
patient and transplant characteristics. Eighty-two
patients had AML and 34 ALL. The median age was 36
years old (range, 16-62 years old). The median time
from diagnosis to first complete remission was 43 days
(range, 14-196), the median time from first complete
remission to transplantation 107 days (range, 13-321
days) and the median time from diagnosis to trans￾plantation 162 days (range, 49-358 days). The number
of lines of induction chemotherapy to reach first com￾plete remission was one for 68% of the patients, two
for 21% of patients, and over two for 11% of the
patients. Seven patients received a syngeneic trans￾plant more than 6 months after achieving first com￾plete remission. 
Transplant characteristics of all patients 
All patients received a myeloablative conditioning
regimen which included total body irradiation in 58%
of the patients overall, in 49% of those with AML and
in 79% of the ALL patients. The source of stem cells
was bone marrow for 70% of the patients, peripheral
blood for 29%, and 1% received both bone marrow
and peripheral blood. The majority of patients (86.5%)
did not receive any GVHD prophylaxis, whereas the
remaining (13.5%) did receive prophylaxis.
Information on parity of female patients and recipients
was partially retrieved (62.5% of syngeneic transplan￾tations). Twenty-two female patients were nulliparous
and 21 parous, 19 female donors were nulliparous and
20 parous. 
Transplant characteristics of patients transplanted
in first complete remission 
All patients received a myeloablative conditioning
regimen, which included total body irradiation in 58%
of them. The source of stem cells was bone marrow
for 68% of the patients. No GVHD prophylaxis was
given to 84.5% of this group of patients. Serology for
cytomegalovirus was negative for both donor and
recipient in 31% of the transplants. 
Engraftment
Engraftment was defined as the time to reach a neu￾trophil count of 0.5×109
/L and a platelet count of
0.5×109
/L. All patients but one engrafted. For bone
marrow transplantation the median time to reach
0.5×109
/L neutrophils, calculated from the day of the
transplant, was 15 days (range, 10-51 days) and the
median time to reach a platelet count of 0.5×109
/L was
24 days (range, 12-247 days). For peripheral blood
transplantation the median time to reach neutrophil
engraftment was 12 days (range, 8-42 days), and the
time to reach a platelet count of 0.5×109
/L was 16 days
(range, 8-73 days).
Acute and chronic GVHD
Nineteen patients developed acute GVHD: 13 grade
I, four grade II, and two grade III-IV. For six patients
the diagnosis of acute GVHD was proven by a biopsy;
five of these six patients were confirmed to be
monozygotic twins either serologically (n=3) or by
molecular biology (n=2). Eight patients out of 22
patients given GVHD prophylaxis developed acute
GVHD. Only three patients developed chronic GVHD

which was limited in two patients and extensive in
one patient. One patient died from acute GVHD.
Outcome 
The median follow-up for survivors was 60 months
(range 1-275 months). A total of 69/162 patients died.
The original disease was the cause of death for 49
patients. The remaining 20 patients died from GVHD
(n=1), cardiac toxicity (n=2), hemorrhages (n=2), graft
failure (n=1), infections (n=6), interstitial pneumonitis
(n=4), secondary malignancy (n=1), and other non￾relapse-related causes (n=3). The outcome at 5 years
for all patients showed a leukemia-free survival of
43±3%, a relapse incidence of 49±8% and a non￾relapse mortality rate of 8±5%. Patients in first com￾plete remission showed leukemia-free survival, relapse
incidence and non-relapse mortality rates at 5 years of
53±5%, 40±4% and 7±2%, respectively (Figure 1). At
1 year the leukemia-free survival was 40±45% and
42±17% for patients with AML (n=10) or ALL (n=11),
respectively, transplanted in second complete remis￾sion. At 3 years the leukemia-free survival, relapse
incidence and non-relapse mortality rates in the whole
group of patients transplanted in second complete
remission were 28±11%, 62±10% and 10±7%, respec￾tively, and the corresponding figures in patients trans￾planted in a more advanced stage of disease were
27±9%, 69±7% and 4±4% at 3 years. 
Outcome of patients with Philadelphia-positive ALL
transplanted in first complete remission
The t(9; 22) Philadelphia chromosome was detected,
by cytogenetics, in five patients and one further
patient had the bcr/abl rearrangement detected by
molecular biology, with a normal karyotype. Of these
six paients, two died from relapse at 865 days and 778
days after transplantation. The remaining four patients
were alive, one in relapse with a follow-up of 234
days, and the three in complete remission with follow￾ups of 636 days, 632 days and 138 days. 
Analyses of risk factors associated with outcomes
after syngeneic HSCT for patients with acute
leukemia transplanted in first complete remission 
Cytomegalovirus status, source of stem cells, year of
transplant, type of acute leukemia (AML or ALL), and
total body irradiation in the conditioning regimen were
not statistically significantly associated with outcomes
(Table 2). The numbers of courses of chemotherapy to
induce first complete remission was an important fac￾tor associated with leukemia-free survival, relapse inci￾dence and non-relapse mortality. Leukemia-free sur￾vival at 5 years was 66±6% when first complete remis￾sion was reached after one course of induction
chemotherapy and was only 20±9% when first com￾plete remission was reached after at least two courses
of induction chemotherapy (p=0.0001). The relapse
incidence was 30±6% and 64±10%, respectively
(p=0.007), and the non-relapse mortality rate 4±3% and
15±8%, respectively (p=0.052) (Figure 2). Recipient age
(below 36 years old) was also associated with increased
leukemia-free survival. 
In multivariate analysis the only variable that was
still statistically significant was one induction course
of chemotherapy to reach first complete remission.
This variable was associated with a higher leukemia￾free survival (p=0.0007, RR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18-0.63)
and a lower relapse incidence (p=0.015, RR: 2.4, 95%
CI: 1.2-4.8).
Discussion
Syngeneic HSCT is a rare event. We report here the
largest series of syngeneic transplants performed for
acute leukemia in adults. The objectives of this study
were to describe the outcomes of patients receiving
such transplants and to analyze prognostic factors in
adult patients who underwent syngeneic HSCT in
first complete remission.
We found that leukemia-free survival at 5 years was
53% for patients transplanted in first complete remis￾sion, and 66% when the first complete remission was
obtained after one induction course. These results are
comparable to those previously reported after

vival rates are essentially the same as those in our
study. This is mainly explained by the very low non￾relapse mortality usually found after syngeneic HSCT.
However we also found that the relapse incidence at 5
years was only 40% among patients transplanted in
first complete remission and only 30% when the first
complete remission was reached with one induction
course. This last observation indicates that the combi￾nation of a low non-relapse mortality rate and a pos￾sible syngeneic graft-versus-leukemia effect resulted
in a good survival. Indeed, a syngeneic graft-versus￾leukemia effect has already been suggested by retro￾spective studies comparing syngeneic HSCT to HLA￾identical sibling HSCT in acute leukemia, chronic
myeloid leukemia3 and multiple myeloma.13 In these
studies the leukemia-free survival of patients given the
two types of transplants was not statistically different.
Furthermore authentic cases of acute and chronic
GVHD were reported after syngeneic transplants.14-16
In our study, acute GVHD occurred in only 19 patients
(11%) and chronic GVHD in only three patients
(1.8%). Acute GVHD was histologically proven in six
patients who were all, except one, confirmed as
monozygotic twins, thus excluding the possiblity that
the GVHD had occured in non-twin transplants.
Given the low incidence of acute and chronic GVHD
in our study, it was not possible to analyze any asso￾ciations of GVHD with outcomes, particulary relapse. 
Some authors have tried to identify parameters that
could influence the occurrence of GVHD and the
graft-versus-leukemia effect after syngeneic HSCT. In
an IBMTR study the dose of syngeneic nucleated cells
infused was shown to have an effect on survival.5 The
outcome was improved when more than 3×108 nucle￾ated cells/kg were transplanted: a lower relapse rate
was associated with a higher dose of nucleated cells. 
A more recent study identified risk factors for
GVHD in 126 consecutive cases of syngeneic HSCT.6
In this study the cumulative incidence of GVHD was
18%. GVHD was more frequent when the donor was
parous than when the donor was nulliparous or male,
and when the recipient was parous than when the
recipient was nulliparous. Other risk factors for syn￾geneic GVHD included age, busulfan/melphalan/thio￾tepa in the conditioning regimen, post-transplant
interleukin 2, HLA-A26, and more recent transplanta￾tion year. However, it was pointed out that many of
the risk factors in syngeneic GVHD were the same as
those in allogeneic HSCT. In our study the main prog￾nostic factor that influenced outcome, according to
both univariate and multivariate analyses, was the
number of induction courses to reach first complete
remission. This factor has already been recognized as
a major prognostic factor in all transplants for acute
leukemia.17,18 Neither our study nor previous studies
have been able to identify peculiar factors that could
influence the occurrence of syngeneic GVHD and a
syngeneic graft-versus-leukemia effect. 
In summary, this study showed that syngeneic
HSCT for acute leukemia can lead to a high survival
rate among adult patients transplanted in first com￾plete remission. This was mainly due to a low non￾relapse mortality rate but also to a possible syngeneic
graft-versus-leukemia effect. Since the results of syn￾geneic transplantation were better when the trans￾plant was performed in first complete remission
obtained after one course of induction, it remains
questionable whether a search for an alternative
donor is necessary in other patients.
