Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth abnormality and the etiology is unknown in the overwhelming
majority of cases. ISLET1 (ISL1) is a transcription factor that marks cardiac progenitor cells and generates diverse multipotent
cardiovascular cell lineages. The fundamental role of ISL1 in cardiac morphogenesis makes this an exceptional candidate
gene to consider as a cause of complex congenital heart disease. We evaluated whether genetic variation in ISL1 fits the
common variant–common disease hypothesis. A 2-stage case-control study examined 27 polymorphisms mapping to the
ISL1 locus in 300 patients with complex congenital heart disease and 2,201 healthy pediatric controls. Eight genic and
flanking ISL1 SNPs were significantly associated with complex congenital heart disease. A replication study analyzed these
candidate SNPs in 1,044 new cases and 3,934 independent controls and confirmed that genetic variation in ISL1 is
associated with risk of non-syndromic congenital heart disease. Our results demonstrate that two different ISL1 haplotypes
contribute to risk of CHD in white and black/African American populations.

Introduction
CHD affects 1 in 20 live births, 1 in 100 of which require an
intervention [1,2]. Recognizable chromosomal variants account
for 13% of all CHD patients although high-resolution technologies
may uncover more subtle defects [3]. Additionally, mutations in a
few genes, such as GATA4 and NKX2–5, have been associated with
rare-monogenic disorders that include a cardiac phenotype in
humans [4,5,6]. However, no common genetic variants have been
robustly associated with the risk of non-syndromic, complex CHD.
Here we describe the first such association.
During vertebrate cardiac development, the 3-dimensional
structure of the heart is formed from the differentiation and
interaction of multiple tissue derivatives, or fields [7]. The
primary and secondary heart fields of the embryonic disc give
rise to the intracardiac structures of the heart under the
influence of adjacent tissues [8]. The secondary heart field
provides an especially important source of cells directing
complex morphogenesis and is the source of cardiac progenitor
cells marked by the transcription factor ISL1. These can be
isolated from postnatal hearts of rodents and humans that
maintain the ability to differentiate into multiple cardiac
lineages [9,10]. Although mice deficient in Isl1 harbor defects
in cardiac morphogenesis, the role of ISL1 in human congenital
heart disease is unknown [11,12].
Results
We conducted a two-stage candidate gene study to test the
hypothesis that germline common genetic variants in ISL1 confer
susceptibility to non-syndromic human CHD. The stage 1 study
was comprised of 300 CHD cases (white n = 160, black/African
American n = 70, other/unknown = 70) and 2,201 CHD-free
controls (white n = 2091, black/African American n = 110). Cases
were children diagnosed with complex, non-syndromic CHD, all
of which required operative repair. Guided by lineage-tracing
analyses in rodents, cases were defined by diseases representative
of secondary heart field defect phenotypes [11,13,14]. Defects of
the second heart field are potentially pathogenic in anatomic
defects of both the right and left sides of the normal heart due the
contribution of secondary heart field derivatives in both inflow and
outflow tracts. These include defects of atrial septation, ventricular
septation, conus positioning, and great vessel alignment (Fig. S1).
We analyzed 30 SNPs spanning a 237 kb region around ISL1
on chromosome 5q11.1, selected to capture variation in this region
based upon linkage disequilibrium patterns in subjects of

European ancestry (http://www.hapmap.org). No genome-wide
data were available for this hypothesis-driven, candidate gene
study. Eight individual SNPs (rs6867206, rs4865656, rs6869844,
rs2115322, rs6449600, IVS1+17C.T, rs1017, rs6449612) were
significantly associated with risk of CHD at the a= 0.05 level
(Fig. 1A) located within a single LD block. Indeed, HapMap data
demonstrate D’ = 1 between three of these SNPs (rs6869844,
rs6449600, rs6449612) and each of the four Hapmap published
SNPs within ISL1 (rs3792733, rs2288468, rs3811911, rs991216).
The moderate magnitudes of association seen at these SNPs
(OR = 1.32–2.30) were consistent with those expected under the
common disease-common variant hypothesis. Furthermore, the
closest gene to ISL1 is located in a different LD block more than
540 kb upstream (PARP8), reducing the likelihood that these SNPs
are capturing an association between a gene other than ISL1 and
risk of CHD. Of the six ISL1-flanking SNPs, rs6869844 remained
statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing
(P = 0.039 with Bonferroni correction for 30 SNPs). Located
15.7 kb 59 of ISL1, rs6869844 was associated with a 50% increase
in risk for each additional T allele in a log-additive model (Odds
ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18–1.95).
Three SNPs analyzed in stage 1 (rs3762977, IVS1+17C.T,
rs1017) were located within the ISL1 gene in the 59UTR, intron 1,
and the 39 UTR, respectively (Fig. S2). To diminish the potential
for confounding population stratification, we first restricted our
stage 1 analyses to white cases with non-syndromic CHD and
white controls (n = 100 cases, 576 controls) with genotype data
available for these SNPs. IVS1+17C.T was associated with a
more than two-fold increase in risk among whites with the C/T
genotype (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.12–4.70, P = 0.023) (Table 1).
Rs1017 was highly significant in a log additive model, with an
81% increase in risk associated with each additional copy of the T
allele (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.29–2.54, P = 0.0007). Dominant and
recessive models for rs1017 were also highly significant. Children
with the A/T or T/T genotype had a 2.28-fold increase in risk
compared to children with the A/A genotype (OR = 2.28, 95% CI
1.35–3.87, P = 0.002). Similarly, children with the T/T genotype
had a 2.21-fold increase in risk compared to children with the A/A
or A/T genotype (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.17–3.80, P = 0.013).
We then delineated the patterns of risk in these populations by
using the expectation maximization (EM) method to estimate
haplotypes and risk of CHD from the 6 ISL1-flanking SNPs
(rs6867206, rs4865656, rs6869844, rs2115322, rs6449600,
rs6449612) and the 3 SNPs within ISL1 (rs3762977, IVS1+17C.T,
rs1017). The three SNPs within ISL1 most effectively captured risk
of CHD. In stage 1 whites, an additive model fit the data well (global
haplotype association P= 0.0008). Two haplotypes, A-C-T and A￾T-T (rs3762977- IVS1+17C.T -rs1017), were strongly associated
with CHD risk. A child’s risk of CHD was 2.01 times greater with
each copy of the A-C-T haplotype compared to the A-C-A
haplotype (95%CI 1.35–3.00, P= 0.0006) and 3.29 times greater
with each copy of the A-T-T haplotype (95% CI 1.51–7.16,
P= 0.0027).
To independently validate our findings, we studied ISL1
variation in a second, independent analysis of populations from
the US, Canada, and the Netherlands. Stage 2 cases and controls
were completely distinct from those in initial stage 1. The stage 2
white population consisted of 995 cases (US n = 265, Canada
n = 94, Netherlands n = 636) and 2089 controls (North America
n = 1446, Netherlands n = 643). Single SNP analyses in the stage 2
US white population confirmed the association at 10 SNPs within
and around ISL1 (Fig. 1B). Specifically, of the 3 SNPs within ISL1,
rs1017 was significantly associated with risk of CHD in a log￾additive model (Table 1). Each copy of the T allele at rs1017
increased a child’s risk of CHD by 27% (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.05–
1.54, P = 0.013).
Haplotype analysis in the stage 2 white population confirmed
that the A-C-T haplotype is significantly associated with risk
among whites (Global P = 0.00003). Each copy of the A-C-T
haplotype conferred an 18% increase in risk (OR = 1.18, 95% CI
1.00–1.39, P = 0.0485) compared to the A-C-A haplotype.
Combined analysis of both stage 1 and stage 2 for the A-C-T
haplotype in whites was highly significant (Tables 2, S4, S5; Fig. 2),
with a 27% increase in risk of CHD (95% CI 1.09–1.48,
P = 0.0018).
The precise distribution of CHD diagnoses was different
between stage 1 and stage 2 populations (Fig. S1). However,
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and D-transposition of
the great arteries (D-TGA) were the most common diagnoses in
both stages. To ensure that the stage 2 validation of our original
findings was not influenced by the differences among case
populations, we performed a subset analysis to include only the
most frequent diagnoses in both stages, HLHS and D-TGA.
Associations with rs1017 and the A-C-T haplotype in stage 1,
stage 2, and combined analyses were consistent with analyses
utilizing cases of all secondary heart field defects in both
magnitude and significance of association (Tables S4, S5, and
S6). This indicates that risk of CHD is consistently associated with
common genetic variation in ISL1 in white populations whether
considering all secondary heart field defects or subsets of these
diagnoses.
To understand the role of ISL1 variation in other populations,
we investigated these 3 SNPs in the stage 1 black/African
American cases and controls, using the exact same phenotypic
definitions for cases with non-syndromic CHD (n = 54 cases, 110
controls). Compared to whites, analysis at these three loci
demonstrated a different pattern of association between ISL1
and risk of CHD. While no association was observed at rs3762977
in whites, black/African American children were at a more than 2-
fold increase in risk for each additional copy of the G allele at this
locus (OR = 2.21, 95%CI 1.15–4.24; P = 0.017). Variation at
IVS1+17C.T was extremely rare among blacks/African Amer￾icans with only 1 heterozygous control and 0 heterozygous cases,
and no association between rs1017 and risk of CHD was observed
(OR = 1.08, 95%CI 0.66–1.76; P = 0.756). However, as with the
single SNP analyses, haplotype analysis showed that the black/
African American population demonstrated a distinct pattern of
risk at the ISL1 locus. The A-C-T haplotype was not associated
with increased risk of CHD among blacks, and the A-T-T
haplotype was not identified in any cases or controls of black/
African American ancestry. In contrast, the G-C-T haplotype was
associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of CHD (OR = 1.99,
95%CI 1.02–3.87; P = 0.043).
To independently validate our findings in blacks/African
Americans, we analyzed a distinct set of 49 US black/African
American cases and 1,845 US black/African American controls.
In this stage 2 population, the relative risk for rs3762977 was
consistent with that seen in stage 1 blacks/African Americans
(OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.74–1.95, P = 0.457), although not
statistically significant. Similarly, the G-C-T haplotype did not
reach statistical significance among blacks/African Americans in
stage 2, but the relative risk for this haplotype was consistent with
that seen in stage 1 (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.75–2.19, P = 0.359).
Importantly, the G-C-T haplotype was significantly associated
with risk of CHD in a summary analysis of stage 1 and stage 2
blacks/African Americans, where each copy of this haplotype
conferred a 57% increase in risk (95% CI 1.07–2.30, P = 0.0216)
(Fig. 2).

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that two different ISL1 haplotypes
contribute to risk of CHD in white and black/African American
populations. These data provide strong evidence that congenital
heart disease is consistent with the common variant–common
disease hypothesis in two ethnically distinct populations. Further
work is necessary to determine whether these two haplotypes
capture ancestrally distinct causative mutations or are in linkage
disequilibrium with a single disease-causing mutation. Our
observations of different risk haplotypes in white and black/
African American populations is intriguing and suggests that
different risk alleles are present in the ISL1 locus within these
populations. This provides an opportunity for identifying causal
variants through subsequent studies with admixture mapping or
deep sequencing within these two patient populations.
The biologic rationale is compelling: ISL1 is a transcription
factor that marks cardiac progenitor cells and controls secondary
heart field differentiation, and new evidence suggests that purified
populations of ISL1+ progenitor cells are capable of self-renewal
and expansion into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endo￾thelial lineages [15]. In addition to providing new insight into the
variety of congenital heart disease phenotypes that can be
produced from second heart field defects in humans, our
observations also may provide the basis for a more integrated
understanding of the molecular basis of human congenital heart
disease.
Materials and Methods
Sample collection
United States cases and controls were recruited from the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between 12/12/2003
and 08/25/2008 on a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of CHOP and the University of Michigan, and
parents provided written informed consent. 31.6% (613/1939) of
all eligible cases seen at the CHOP cardiac center in this time
period participated in this study. Cases and controls from Toronto
and the Netherlands were recruited on institution-specific
protocols, and were also approved by the IRBs of CHOP and
the University of Michigan. Cases were children with complex
congenital heart disease requiring surgical repair. Controls were
patients without congenital heart disease recruited through either
the CHOP Health Care Network by CHOP clinicians and nursing
staff or through UMC Utrecht. The controls were screened by
counselors who evaluated by patient history for a absence of
structural heart disease. All patients had been evaluated by a
medical doctor. Ethnicity for cases was determined by self-report
and principal components analysis, and ethnicity for controls was
determined by principal components analysis. This analysis was
performed for all stage 2 subjects of unknown ethnicity as well as a
representative subset of stage 1 cases and controls of known
ethnicity (Fig. S3). The first two principal components were
plotted for stage 1 cases of known ethnicity, demonstrating that the
first principal component distinguished between white and blacks/
African American cases using a cutoff of PC1#0.025 to define
ethnicity as white and PC1.0.025 to define ethnicity as black/
African American. Similarly, the first principal component
sufficiently distinguished between stage 1 white and blacks/
African American controls, using a cutoff of PC1#0.0059 to
define ethnicity as white and PC1.0.0059 to define ethnicity as
black/African American.
ISL1 genotyping
Stage 1 and stage 2 genotypes were requested for 27 ISL1-
flanking SNPs from the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP
that had been performed using the Illumina HumanHap 550 SNP
array. Genotypes for only these 27 SNPs were obtained from the
Center for Applied Genomics, and no additional genotypes on this

27 SNPs for US cases and US controls in both stage 1 and stage 2.
Genotypes for the 3 SNPs within ISL1 (rs3762977,

methods: 1) bidirectional sequencing of ISL1 exons 1 and 6 or 2)
genotype imputation. Stage 1 genotyping of these 3 SNPs was
performed using bidirectional Sanger sequencing, accomplished at
the University of Michigan sequencing core (Table S1 and Table

SNPs within ISL1 for US cases and all controls using 97 SNPs
surrounding these 3 SNPs. Haplotypes were reconstructed for all
100 SNPs in 484 controls using FastPHASE14. These phased,
reconstructed haplotypes were then used as the reference
haplotypes for genotype imputation using the MACH program
[16,17]. Each genotype at each SNP was associated with a QC
score, interpreted as the posterior probability that the imputed
genotype represents the true genotype.
Genotyping accuracy by sequencing was assessed with repeat
sequencing of a subset of genotypes. Two measures were used to
assess imputation error for the three ISL1 SNPs. The first measure,
ej
, captures genotyping error, discrepancies with the reference
panel, and recurrent mutation [16,17]. Slightly lower data quality
is observed for larger estimates of ej
. Values of ej were small for
each of the three SNPs: rs3762977 ej= 0.0229, IVS1+17C.T
ej= 0.0007, rs1017 ej= 0.0434. The second measure of imputation
error was the agreement between genotypes determined by
sequencing and genotypes determined by imputation for a subset
of stage 1 cases and controls for whom both genotypes were
available. Agreement was measured using the Kappa statistic in
SAS (version 9.1) at various QC cutoffs. No QC values for any of
the 3 imputed SNPs were less than 0.5. Inclusion of all imputed
genotypes (regardless of QC value) resulted in Kappa statistics of
at least 0.889 for each of the 3 SNPs, confirming that the genotype
imputation method is robust. All genotype frequencies were
assessed for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
controls.
Statistical methods
Single SNP analyses were conducted using unconditional
logistic regression to calculate odds ratios as implemented in
SAS (version 9.1). Haplotypes were estimated and tested for
association with CHD using the Haplo.stats package in R (http://
cran.r-project.org). Significance testing was adjusted for multiple
comparisons with Bonferroni correction, and 95% confidence
intervals were calculated from the parameters estimated in logistic
regression. Population attributable fractions were calculated using
haplotype-specific odds ratios and haplotype frequencies.
Additional methods for the adjustment of population
stratification
We performed additional analyses to determine the sensitivity of
our previously described method of defining ethnicity by principal
components analysis in stage 2. The alternative classification
method we employed was the ANCESTRYMAP [18] program,
which uses genotype information from two ancestral populations
to estimate admixture in a test population. We used 26 of 136
ancestral informative markers (AIMs) on chromosome 5 for which
genotype information for stage 2 subjects was available (Table S3)
[19]. None of these 26 SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with
the ISL1 locus based upon LD patterns in subjects of European
ancestry (http://www.hapmap.org). The 26 AIM genotypes for
the two ancestral populations, the Centre d’Etude du Polymor￾phisme Humain (European) and Yoruban (African) HapMap
samples, were downloaded from http://www.hapmap.org. We ran
the ANCESTRYMAP program [18] using default parameters to
obtain estimates of the percent European ancestry for all US stage
2 subjects of unknown ancestry as well as a subset of US stage 1
subjects of known ancestry (Fig. S4). A bimodal distribution of the
percent European ancestry was observed among all subjects,
which was highly correlated with self-reported ethnicity among
stage 1 subjects. Subjects with greater than 65% European
ancestry were defined as white, and subjects with less then 65%
European ancestry were defined as black/African American.
Single SNP and haplotype analyses were performed using
ANCESTRYMAP-defined ethnicity, and results were qualitatively
similar to those described above.

Figure S1 Diagnosis distribution in stage 1 and stage 2 case￾control studies. Cases were chosen a priori to represent a wide
variety of developmental phenotypes that include developmental
structures aberrantly formed as derivatives of the secondary heart
field. These diagnostic choices were informed from lineage tracing
analyses of Isl1+ progenitor cells in rodents. ALCAPA- anomalous
left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, ASD- atrial septal
defect, AVSD- atrioventricular septal defect/AV canal, CCTGA￾congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, L-TGA- L￾transposition of the great arteries, D-TGA- D- transposition of the

Figure S2 Chromosome 5 variation in the ISL1 region. The
location of ISL1 on chromosome 5 (Build 36) is depicted, where
exons of the ISL1 gene are depicted as shaded boxes, the 59 UTR
and 39 UTR are depicted as white boxes, and introns are
represented as black lines. The three SNPs within ISL1 studied in
stage 1 and stage 2 are depicted with respect to their location in
the gene. The six SNPs flanking ISL1 identified as significantly
associated with risk of CHD in stage 1 are indicated along
chromosome 5.

Figure S3 Ethnic distribution of cases and controls by cluster
analysis. The first two principal components from a principal
components analysis utilizing all SNPs on chromosome 5 that are
contained within the Illumina HumanHap550 array are plotted
for a) stage 1 cases of known ethnicity, where PC1#0.025 captures
white cases and PC1.0.025 captures black/African American
cases; b) stage 2 cases of unknown ethnicity, where PC1#0.025
defines white cases and PC1.0.025 defines black/African
American cases; c) stage 1 controls of known ethnicity, where
PC1#0.0059 captures white controls and PC1.0.0059 captures
black/African American controls; b) stage 2 cases of unknown
ethnicity, where PC1#0.0059 defines white controls and
PC1.0.0059 defines black/African American controls.

Figure S4 ANCESTRYMAP admixture estimation using 26
Ancestral Informative Markers. The distribution of estimated
percent European ancestry for a) all stage 1 US subjects of known
ethnicity (n = 650), b) stage 1 US whites (n = 251), c) stage 2 US
blacks/African Americans (n = 399), and d) stage 2 US subjects of
unknown ethnicity (n = 3610). 65% cutoff is represented by a red
line. Individuals above 65% European ancestry were defined as
white in stage 2 US subjects and below 65% were defined as
black/African American.
