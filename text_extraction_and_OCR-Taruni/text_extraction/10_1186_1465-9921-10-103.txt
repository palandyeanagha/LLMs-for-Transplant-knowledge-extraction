Abstract
Background: The aim of the present study was to explore the occurrence of fibrocytes in tissue
and to investigate whether the appearance of fibrocytes may be linked to structural changes of the
parenchyme and vasculature in the lungs of patients with obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) following
lung or bone marrow transplantation.
Methods: Identification of parenchyme, vasculature, and fibrocytes was done by histological
methods in lung tissue from bone marrow or lung-transplanted patients with obliterative
bronchiolitis, and from controls.
Results: The transplanted patients had significantly higher amounts of tissue in the alveolar
parenchyme (46.5 ± 17.6%) than the controls (21.7 ± 7.6%) (p < 0.05). The patients also had
significantly increased numbers of fibrocytes identified by CXCR4/prolyl4-hydroxylase, CD45R0/
prolyl4-hydroxylase, and CD34/prolyl4-hydroxylase compared to the controls (p < 0.01). There
was a correlation between the number of fibrocytes and the area of alveolar parenchyma; CXCR4/
prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.01), CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.05) and CD34/prolyl 4-
hydroxylase (p < 0.05). In the pulmonary vessels, there was an increase in the endothelial layer in
patients (0.31 ± 0.13%) relative to the controls (0.037 ± 0.02%) (p < 0.01). There was a significant
correlation between the number of fibrocytes and the total area of the endothelial layer CXCR4/
prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.001), CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.001) and CD34/prolyl 4-
hydroxylase (p < 0.01). The percent areas of the lumen of the vessels were significant (p < 0.001)
enlarged in the patient with OB compared to the controls. There was also a correlation between
total area of the lumen and number of fibrocytes, CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.01),
CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.001) and CD34/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: Our results indicate that fibrocytes are associated with pathological remodelling
processes in patients with OB and that tissue fibrocytes might be a useful biomarker in these
processes.

Introduction
Lung transplantation (LTP) represents a treatment option
in many end-stage lung diseases such as chronic obstruc￾tive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmo￾nary fibrosis (IPF). Unfortunately, as many as 60% of
patients who have been transplanted develop obliterative
bronchiolitis (OB) which is a form of chronic rejection,
within 5 years [1]. It is also known that bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) after, for example, acute and
chronic leukaemia, anaemia, and rare immunodeficiency
disorders, can also lead to OB at a frequency of 2-11% [2-
4], with similar pathological characteristics as after LTP.
The reason that some patients develop OB is still unclear,
but one of the most frequent risk factors is repeated acute
rejection, followed by lymphocytic bronchitis or bronchi￾olitis [5]. The histological findings are described as epithe￾lial injury, with mononuclear inflammation and fibrotic
lesions that lead to intraluminal polypoid plugs of granu￾lation tissue within the terminal and respiratory bronchi￾oles. The lesions consist of fibroblasts and/or
myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM). The main
producers of ECM are lung fibroblasts and phenotypes
derived from fibroblasts. There are three current hypothe￾ses concerning the origin of these cells: 1.) proliferation
and/or differentiation of resident fibroblasts [6]; 2.) epi￾thelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [7-9]; and 3.)
recruitment of circulating progenitors such as fibrocytes to
the lung, where they differentiate further into specific
fibroblast phenotypes. Fibrocytes are identified by specific
combinations of mesenchymal markers such as prolyl 4-
hydroxylase and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), together
with haematopoietic markers such as CD34, leukocyte
markers such as CD45 [10,11], and chemokine receptors
such as CXCR4 [12].
In a previous study, our group showed that there is accu￾mulation of sub-epithelial fibrocytes in patients with mild
asthma [13]. There was a positive correlation between the
number of fibrocytes and the thickness of the lamina retic￾ularis layer of the basement membrane, which is also a
characteristic feature of asthma. Furthermore, fibrocytes
have been observed near fibroblastic foci in patients with
IPF [14]. Bröcker et a. also identified recipient-derived
αSMA-positive cells in lung tissue in a study of two
patients with OB after bone marrow transplantation [15].
When fibrocytes move from the circulation to the injured
lung tissue, there is a gradual loss of haematopoietic
markers while the expression of mesenchymal markers
increases [16].
It has been shown that LTP patients have a reduced
number of blood vessels in the small airways before devel￾oping obliteration of the airway [17], and that LTP
patients with BOS (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome)
have higher microvascular density in endobronchial biop￾sies than controls. The changed composition of the vessels
has been hypothesised to be a tissue reaction to relative
hypoxia and hypercarbia [18].
Together, the previous findings have led to the hypothesis
that fibrocytes may be an additional source of mesenchy￾mal cells in fibrotic lesions. If so, fibrocytes either circulat￾ing or in tissue, could be a possible biomarker for
remodelling in OB, and the vascular remodelling in these
patients might facilitate an increased influx of fibrocytes
into the tissue. These events may play an important role in
the development of fibrosis in OB. Hereby we show that
the number of fibrocytes identified in tissue was corre￾lated to structural remodelling of both the pulmonary ves￾sels and the alveolar parenchyma.
Materials and methods
Patients
The OB patients included in the study had all undergone
LTP or BMT (Table 1). The mean age at transplantation
was 34.4 years (range: 10-65). The LTP patients were
transplanted because of bronchiolitis, emphysema, or
cystic fibrosis while the BMT patients had aplastic anae￾mia or lymphatic leukaemia. The patient group consisted
of two females and four males. The study was performed
on autopsies from this group of patients and tissues were
obtained from part of the peripheral lungs. Control lung

tissue was collected during surgery from patients with sus￾picion of lung cancer but with otherwise healthy lungs
(mean age of 65.3 years; range: 50-73). The tissue in the
control patients was obtained by wedge resections to
make the samples as comparable as possible. Only
patients with well-delineated tumours were included and
(as far as possible) the tissue was collected possible away
from the tumour. None of the controls had ever smoked,
and there were four females and two males. This proce￾dure has often been used to collect human control tissue
[19]. The study was approved by the local research ethics
committee (534/2005).
Tissue Preparation and General Histopathological 
Evaluation
After excision, the tissue was fixed in standard 4% buff￾ered formalin. After dehydration, it was embedded in par￾affin. For a gross histological characterization, tissues
from both the patient group and the control group were
stained with Gomori's trichrome. All analyses were done
blinded and also counted by a second person.
Immunofluorescence of Fibrocytes
After heat-induced antigen retrieval, non-specific binding
in lung sections was blocked with Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) containing 0.5% BSA and 5% horse serum, and avi￾din/biotin block according to the instructions of the man￾ufacturer (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The
sections were incubated overnight with either CXCR4
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (15 μg/ml), CD45R0
(5 μg/ml), or CD34 (5 μg/ml). (the latter two from BD
Biosciences, Pharmingen, Leiden, the Netherlands). The
signals from CD34, CD45R0, and CXCR4 were amplified
using biotinylated antibody (1:100 dilution), (Vector
Laboratories Inc. Burlingame CA) followed by bioti￾nylated anti-immunoglobulin antibody (1:200 dilution
in PBS containing 1% BSA). The specimens were also
incubated with primary antibody to prolyl 4-hydroxylase
(Acris Antibodies, Hiddenhausen, Germany) (1 μg/ml),
and then with a corresponding secondary antibody conju￾gated with Alexa fluorocrome (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR), in TBS containing 1% goat serum (Vector Laborato￾ries) for 1 hour. For the combination of CD34 and prolyl
4-hydroxylase, the primary antibody to prolyl 4-hydroxy￾lase was pre-labelled with Alexa fluorochrome according
to the instructions included in the Zenon Labeling Kit
(Molecular Probes). The nuclei were visualised with DAPI
(Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). To quantify lung fibro￾cytes, a field with six randomly selected areas of 0.28 mm2
was analyzed for double-stained cells (i.e. fibrocytes).
Immunofluorescence of Vessels
Five-micrometer-thick paraffin sections of formalin-fixed
lung tissue were incubated overnight with primary anti￾body to von Willebrand factor (Dako, Glostrup, Den￾mark) diluted 1:600 in TBS containing 1% BSA. The
primary antibody was detected with a secondary antibody
conjugated with Alexa-555 fluorochrome (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) in TBS containing 1% goat serum
(Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour. The nuclei were visual￾ised with DAPI.
Calculation of Areas and Numbers of Vessels
50 pulmonary vessels with a luminal area of between 400
and 180,000 μm2, located more than 500 μm from the
nearest bronchiole, were randomly chosen and analyzed
for luminal area and thickness of endothelial layer. This
was performed by computerized image analysis using the
NIS-Elements AR 3.0 system (Nikon) a Nikon Eclips 80i
microscope, and a Nikon DS-Qi1Mc camera. Endothelial
layer thickness was determined by measuring the thick￾ness of vonWillebrand factor positive endothelial cells. To
obtain the lung density of parenchymal pulmonary ves￾sels (defined as being more than 500 μm from a bronchi￾ole), two parameters were used: 1.) the percentage of total
lung tissue that comprised luminal area of pulmonary ves￾sel, and 2.) the percentage of total lung tissue that con￾sisted of pulmonary vessel endothelium. Both of these
parameters were calculated by analysing the entire sec￾tional area of a large (> 2 cm2) lung tissue section. Pulmo￾nary arteries and veins with a luminal diameter of less
than 400 μm2 were excluded from this analysis.
Calculation of the Amount of Tissue in the Alveolar 
Parenchyma
The proportion of air (i.e. luminal spaces) to proper tissue
in the alveolar parenchyma was determined after staining
with Gomori's trichrome. From each patient, three
regions of alveolar parenchyma without any visible bron￾chioles or vessels were analysed, each comprising an area
of 1.20 mm2. After a threshold was selected for each
parameter using the program ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,
MD) the proportion of air (i.e. luminal space) was calcu￾lated.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were done blinded and also counted by a sec￾ond person. The mean values were used for the analysis.
The variance between the results from the two observers
were assessed by Bland-Altman plots including bias, cal￾culation of the limits of agreement, and further calcula￾tion of intraclass correlation coefficients. For example, the
combination CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydroxylase had a bias of
0.065, 95% limits of agreement from -5.2 to 5.4, and
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98. The other combi￾nations of markers to identify fibrocytes showed similar
results. Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation.
Differences between the patient and control groups
regarding the number of fibrocytes, the percentage
endothelia layer, the percentage lumen (of vessels), and

percentage of tissue in alveolar parenchyma were analysed
with the Mann-Whitney U test. All correlation analyses
were done by using Spearman's rank correlation coeffi￾cient test. P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Assessment of the general histopathology in Gomori's tri￾chrome-stained sections revealed bronchioles with a nar￾rowed lumen and characteristic fibrous scarring consistent
with the diagnosis in the OB patients. This scarring con￾sisted of ECM components such as collagen and prote￾oglycans (Figure 1a). In alveolar parenchyma, some
patients had both thickening (Figure 1b) and normal
parts (Figure 1c). The alveolar tissue was more dense in
the OB patients 46.5 ± 17.6% than the controls 21.7 ±
7.6% (p < 0.05) (Figure 1d). There was a significant corre￾lation between the total area of the endothelial layer and
the tissue density in the alveolar parenchyma (R = 0.650 p
< 0.05) (Figure 1e).
Location of Pulmonary Fibrocytes
Regardless of the marker combination used to identify
fibrocytes, these cells were found in varying numbers and
localisations in the lung of both patient groups. Fibrocytes
were present, either alone or in higher frequency, but
without any cell-cell contact in the tissue.
By using different staining combinations to identify sub￾types of fibrocytes, the following results were obtained.
When CXCR4 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase were detected, a
fibrocyte was identified in the lumen closed to septa of the
alveolar structure (Figure 2, a-e); when the combination
of CD45R0 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase was examined, we
identified fibrocytes in the septa of the alveolar paren￾chyma located 38 μm from a vessel (Figure 2, f-j). When
CD34 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase were detected, fibrocytes
close to (34 μm and 45 μm) the endothelial layer were
seen (Figure 2, k-o).
Fibrocytes Were Present at Elevated Levels in Patients with 
OB
In the OB patients, significantly higher numbers of lung
fibrocytes were found (p < 0.01): 13.9 ± 5.27 fibrocytes/
mm2, 10.3 ± 5.84 fibrocytes/mm2, and 7.91 ± 2.77 fibro￾cytes/mm2 for CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydroxylase, CD45R0/
prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and CD34/prolyl 4-hydroxylase,
respectively, as compared to the controls: 4.92 ± 2.12
fibrocytes/mm2, 3.69 ± 2.14 fibrocytes/mm2, and 3.15 ±
1.89 fibrocytes/mm2. When the staining combinations
were compared in the patient group, the staining combi￾nation of CXCR4 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase revealed signif￾icantly more fibrocytes than the combination of CD34
and prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Significantly higher numbers of
fibrocytes were found in the LTP patients: 14.13 ± 6.64
fibrocytes/mm2, 10.99 ± 7.62 fibrocytes/mm2, and 8.15 ±
3.63 fibrocytes/mm2 for CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydroxylase,
CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and CD34/prolyl 4-
hydroxylase, respectively, compared to the controls (p <
0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). Also, signifi￾cantly higher numbers of fibrocytes were present in BMT
patients: 13.54 ± 2.95 fibrocytes/mm2, 9.20 ± 0.50 fibro￾cytes/mm2, and 7.51 ± 0.28 fibrocytes/mm2, respectively,
compared to the controls (p < 0.05 in all three compari￾sons) (Figure 2p).
Patients with OB Have Remodelled Vessels
There was a significantly higher proportion of the
endothelial layer in the patients with OB (0.31 ± 0.13%)
than in the controls (0.037 ± 0.02%) (p < 0.01). The LTP
subjects had significantly greater total area of the endothe￾lial layer (0.34 ± 0.15%) than the controls (p < 0.01) and
the corresponding significance level for BMT was 0.05
with (0.26 ± 0.07%) of total tissue being endothelial
layer. The percentage area of the lumen in the vessels was
significantly greater in the patients with OB (1.16 ±
0.57%) than in the controls (0.10 ± 0.07%) (p < 0.001).
LTP patients alone had significantly larger percentage area
of the lumen (1.43 ± 0.55%) than the controls (p < 0.01).
The BMT patients also had significantly larger total area of
the lumen (0.71 ± 0.10%) than the controls (p < 0.05)
(Figure 3a-d).
Correlation between Tissue Remodelling and Number of 
Fibrocytes
The numbers of fibrocytes identified with the three com￾binations of specific markers correlated well with the
amount of alveolar parenchyma: CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydrox￾ylase (Figure 4a); CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Figure
4b); and CD34/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Figure 4c). Further￾more, there were also correlations between the numbers
of fibrocytes and the total areas of the endothelial layer
and total areas of the lumen: CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydroxylase
(Figure 4d); CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Figure 4e);
and CD34/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Figure 4f). The same pat￾terns were seen in the correlation between total area of the
lumen and number of fibrocytes: CXCR4/prolyl 4-hydrox￾ylase (Figure 4g); CD45R0/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Figure
4h); and CD34/prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Figure 4i).
Endothelium Layer Change with Time from 
Transplantation to Autopsy
In addition, there was a correlation between the mean
area of the endothelial layer and the time from transplan￾tation to autopsy in patients with OB (Figure 5).
Number of CD34/prolyl 4-hydroxylase fibrocytes increase

(Figure 6).
Discussion
This study shows a correlation between structural remod￾elling of several compartments of the lung and the
number of fibrocytes identified in tissue from patients
with OB after transplantation. The fibrocytes were identi￾fied in both the patient and the control groups by com￾bining detection of different markers (CXCR4/CD34/
CD45R0) with detection of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. How￾ever, more fibrocytes were identified in the patient group
- and especially in the LTP patients - than in the controls.
The combination CXCR4 together with prolyl 4-hydroxy￾lase identified the highest number of fibrocytes relative to
the other combinations and the patient group also had a
larger proportion of endothelial layer combined with a
larger amount of vessel lumen compared to the controls.
The number of fibrocytes in lung tissue was also corre￾lated to remodeling changes of the pulmonary vessels.
Moreover, there was a gradual increase in endothelial
layer seen over time from transplantation to autopsy.
There is currently a debate as to whether fibrocytes are
good or bad in airway remodelling. Recently, however,
various studies have indicated that there is an association
between the occurrence of fibrocytes and pathological
structural changes of the airways, paralleled by a decline
in lung function. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it has
been demonstrated that there is a correlation between the
number of fibrocytes lung tissue and the number of
fibroblastic foci [14]. Also, Moeller et al. have shown that
the number of circulating fibrocytes is elevated during an
exacerbation and that the number of these cells may be
useful as a predictor of early mortality in patients with IPF
[20]. Furthermore, Nihlberg et al. have demonstrated that
in asthma patients basement membrane thickness may be
correlated to the number of fibrocytes in lung tissue [13].
Also other studies have shown who the number of circu￾lated fibrocytes are increased by severity of the disease
[21,22]. In accordance with this, the present study has
shown a correlation between the number of fibrocytes
and degree of structural remodeling of the alveolar paren￾chyma as well as degree of remodeling of the vessels.
These findings indicate that the fibrocytes have a negative
effect, at least at the end-stage of OB. Fibrocytes appear to
indicate an ongoing chronic reparative process, at least in
the pulmonary diseases described.
It can be argued that the correlation studies are of less
value as there is already a significant difference between
the control- and patient group in number of fibrocytes
and structural related changes of the tissue. Nevertheless,
the patient material consists of a mixed population of var￾ious disease states (Table 1) with several interlaced values
between lowest and highest points of the correlation line,
indicating true correlations.
Fibrocytes could contribute this chronic reparative process
in several ways. When the fibrocytes are leaving the circu￾lation and passing through the vascular barrier into tissue,
they are able to secrete a cascade of factors: pro-angiogenic
factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
and haematopoietic growth factors that can change the
surrounding environment and the vascular bed by pro￾moting endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and/or
tube formation [23]. Fibrocytes are also able to produce
ECM and to differentiate into fibroblasts or myofibrob￾lasts [24], which are the main producers of both collagen
and proteoglycans such as decorin, versican, and biglycan

[25], and thus could contribute to the development of the
fibrotic lesions seen in OB. This differentiation is possible
when the fibrocyte has entered the tissue after rolling. Ves￾sel changes in the bronchial circulation occur in lung dis￾eases such as asthma [26], but also in patients with OB
[18]. The remodelling of the pulmonary circulation has
not been fully investigated. For example, in IPF the
changes depend both on the progress of the fibrosis and
on the distance from fibroblastic foci, with more vessels
early in the disease and outside fibroblastic foci [27]. In
the present study, all the patients were at the end-stage of
the disease and the remodelling process had continued
over time.

The group of patients who had undergone BMT seemed to
be more homogenous than the LTP group, both regarding
the number of fibrocytes and the degree of remodelling of
vessels. This may be explained by the age of the patients.
All the patients had a close age range - between 10 and 15
years of age at the time of BMT and between 12 and 30
years old when they were lung transplanted. There was a
positive correlation between the number of fibrocytes
identified by CD34 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase and age at
the time of autopsy in LTP patients. Our findings are fur￾ther supported by a study by Mora et al. that showed that
the number of circulating fibrocytes in mice varied with
the age of the mouse, with a higher number being found
in the older animals [28].
It has been reported that patients with OB after LTP have
elevated levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
in respiratory epithelial lining fluid and that cells from
bronchoalveolar lavage show increased expression of
TGF-β [29]. Even though the level of TGF-β in tissue has
only been evaluated in animal models of chronic allograft
rejection [30], it has been shown that TGF-β is a central
cytokine in the development of fibrosis [31]. Further￾more, the expression of VEGF and haematopoietic growth
factors can regulate the TGF-β-dependent development of
fibrotic lesions [32].
A potentially important agent of both fibrocyte differenti￾ation and of the remodeling of vessels is therefore TGF-β.
This cytokine has been shown to differentiate blood￾derived fibrocytes to αSMA-expressing myofibroblasts
[22]; in addition, it has also been shown to increase the
expression of certain ECM molecules that could function
in stabilising vessels.
It is hypothesised that hypoxia is a major contributor to
the induction of remodelling of vessels and in the balance
between deposition and degradation of ECM. This could
occur due to an increased level of nitric oxide which
would result in vasodilation, increased vasopermeability,
and initiation of angiogenesis while the hypoxia itself
would increase expression of VEGFR. Hypoxia is a well￾characterized condition, which elicits expression of
hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) [33], SDF-1 [34], and
CXCR4 [35] and may give rise to recruitment of progeni￾tor cells such as fibrocytes. HIF can upregulate expression
of prolyl 4-hydroxylase [36], a key enzyme in the biosyn￾thesis of collagen, and thus more collagen and ECM
would be synthesised and accumulated. It has also been
shown that SDF-1 can bind to ECM molecules [37], where
the ECM can function as a reservoir and also help to sus￾tain the fibrotic reaction. SDF-1 can also be released from
the ECM under specific conditions such as injury or stress.
In summary, these novel findings have provided us with
some insight into the complexity of OB. Both the remod￾elling of vessels and the thickening of the alveolar paren￾chyma are related to the number of fibrocytes, which can
be assumed to have an important role in OB. Future stud￾ies of these cells will help us to understand the mecha￾nisms behind this very serious complication of

about the fibrogenesis in OB, complementary studies on
additive effects of EMT and resident fibroblast on this
process are warranted.
