Abstract
We have previously shown in a large X-linked pedigree that
a deletion removing the dystrophin muscle promoter, the
first muscle exon and part of intron 1 caused a severe dilated
cardiomyopathy with no associated muscle weakness. Dys￾trophin expression was present in the muscle of affected
males and transcription studies indicated that this dys￾trophin originated from the brain and Purkinje cell iso￾forms, upregulated in this skeletal muscle. We have now
studied dystrophin transcription and expression in the heart
of one member of this family. In contrast to the skeletal
muscle, dystrophin transcription and expression were ab￾sent in the heart, with the exception of the distal Dp7l dys￾trophin isoform, normally present in the heart. The 43- and
50-kD dystrophin-associated proteins were severely reduced
in the heart, despite the presence of Dp7l, but not in skeletal
muscle. The absence of dystrophin and the down-regulation
of the dystrophin-associated proteins in the heart accounted
for the severe cardiomyopathy in this family. The mutation
present in these males selectively affects dystrophin expres￾sion in the heart; this could be secondary to the removal
of cardiac-specific regulatory sequences. This family may
represent the first example of a mutation specifically affect￾ing the cardiac expression of a gene, present physiologically
in both the skeletal and cardiac muscles. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Dilated cardiomyopathies are characterized by ventricular dila￾tation and impaired systolic function. They are the most com￾mon form among the various types of primary myocardial disor￾ders characterized by impaired ventricular function. The preva￾lence of dilated cardiomyopathies has recently been estimated
at 36.5/100,000 the United States (1). The majority of them

have no identifiable cause (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy).
A proportion of these forms, estimated to be at least 20% of
the total, show a clear Mendelian inheritance (2), and various
patterns of inheritance, including autosomal dominant (3, 4),
autosomal recessive (5), and X-linked forms (6) (X-linked di￾lated cardiomyopathy, XLDCM'), have all been documented.
There is apparently no clinical difference between these various
familial and sporadic forms, and their identification relies on
careful examination of the pedigree and, in addition, the study
of first degree relatives. Molecular biological techniques have
now enabled dissection of this group of disorders, and linkage
to the dystrophin gene has been found in two X-linked pedigrees
(7), and mutations in this gene described both in XLDCM fami￾lies (8) and sporadic cases (9).
An autosomal dominant form has also been recently mapped
to chromosome ipI - Iqi (10). The fact that not all autosomal
dominant families with dilated cardiomyopathy are linked to
chromosome 1 suggests the existence of at least a second locus
(10) (Mestroni, unpublished observation). This heterogeneity is
not surprising, considering the number of genes that contribute
to cardiomyocyte integrity and contractility. In the various re￾ported XLDCM families in which a dystrophinopathy was dem￾onstrated (7-9), no muscle weakness nor clinical evidence of
skeletal muscle involvement was found. Although under physio￾logical circumstances dystrophin is expressed at equal levels in
the skeletal and cardiac muscles, and one would therefore expect
mutations in the dystrophin gene to equally affect both tissues,
the families with XLDCM indirectly supported the concept that
some mutations might primarily affect dystrophin expression in
the heart. In the XLDCM cases in which a deletion of the
dystrophin gene was found (8, 9), the lack of availability of
cardiac tissue made it impossible to compare dystrophin gene
expression in the skeletal muscle with that in the heart. This
only allowed one to speculate on the possible reasons for this
peculiar disease course. In particular, it was unclear if a protein
that could maintain its function in the skeletal muscle but not
in the heart was produced or if the mutation selectively affected
dystrophin expression only in the heart (11).
We have now been able to obtain a cardiac biopsy from
one member of the XLDCM family we reported before (8). We
report here the comparative analysis of dystrophin transcription
and expression in the skeletal muscle and heart of this individ￾ual. We found that no dystrophin was produced in his heart,
with the exception of the Dp7l distal isoform (12, 13). The

though expressed in the skeletal muscle, were severely reduced
in the heart, despite the Dp7l expression. Our results strongly
suggest that the mutation found in this family selectively affects
dystrophin expression in the heart but not in the skeletal muscle.
Methods
The XLDCM family (Fig. 1) has previously been described in detail
(8). Muscle biopsies and the cardiac biopsy were obtained after informed
consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the two
hospital involved in the clinical evaluation of patients.
Histology and immunocytochemistry. A needle biopsy of skeletal
muscle was obtained from individuals II-2, 11-6, and 111-1. The left
ventricular biopsy (- 1.5 mg of tissue) was obtained from individual
112 during cardiac catheterization performed during a study aimed at
assess the patient cardiac function, with the view to a cardiac transplant.
The samples were studied according to standard techniques (17), includ￾ing immunocytochemistry using a biotin-Streptavidin Texas red method.
6-,um unfixed cryostat sections were immunostained using a panel of
antibodies to dystrophin (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle-upon￾Tyne, UK), the 43-kD (gift of L. Nicholson) and 50-kD (gift of K.P
Cambell), utrophin (gift of G. E. Morris) and merosin (Chemicon) (18-
20). Western blot analysis was not performed because of the scarcity
of the cardiac tissue obtained with the biopsy.
Reverse transcription and PCR. Total RNA (21) was isolated from
frozen skeletal muscle biopsies of the patients who had a needle muscle
biopsy as part of the diagnostic procedure. Frozen right ventricular wall
cardiac muscle was obtained from individuals that underwent cardiac
transplantation for coronary artery disease. The lymphocyte mRNA was
obtained from fresh blood of normal individuals. The cDNA synthesis
was performed using random hexanucleotide primers, following the
procedure already described (11, 22). PCR was performed in a reaction
volume of 25 ,tl containing the cDNA template (2 dig) and oligonucleo￾tide primers designed to amplify the mid-rod domain of dystrophin (23)
(exon 30-31 or 30-33, oligonucleotides 30: 5' GAGGCTGTAGGA￾GGCAAAAGTTG 3'; 31: 5' ATCCAATCTGATTTGAC AAGTCAT
3'; 33: 5' GACGGAAAATCCCAAAGAACTTGA 3', respectively),
the L-type isoform (24) (L-promoter-exon 6, for the first PCR round,
oligonucleotides 5' CTAGTTCTCCAAGCTCTACTCATG 3' and 5'
ACCCAGCTCA GGAGAATC'l1lCA 3', respectively, while a re￾verse oligonucleotide located in exon 4, 5' ACATTGTTCAGGGCA￾TGAACTCT 3', was used in the second PCR round). Oligonucleotides
for amplifying the a2 laminin chain gene (25) (also referred to as
merosin) were a) forward oligonucleotide 5' CTGTGATCAGTGCTGT
CCAGGGATT 3', position 1001-1025 and b) reverse oligonucleotide
5' TCGAGCATGITTCTCATCCTTGAC 3', position 1350-1326),
while those for the Dp7l transcript were derived from the published
sequences (26): (a) forward primer 5' TCCACTCGTACCCACACT￾CGAC 3'; (b) reverse primer (located in exon 63) 5' GCTAAAGAC￾TGGTAGAGCTCTGTC 3'. PCR reactions (25 jA) used 0.5 U Taq
polymerase, 0.25 M each primer, 200 m each dNTP, in 10 mM Tris￾HCL, pH 8.3, 50 mM KC1 and 1.5 mM MgC12. Amplification conditions
were 940C denaturation for 10 min, followed by 940C (30 s), 580C
annealing (60 s), and 720C extension (120 s), for 26 cycles. 9 jtl of the
reactions were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels containing 0.2 grams/ml
of ethidium bromide prior to photography. A second round of PCR was
performed when studying the transcription of the L-type promoter.
Results
Skeletal muscle biopsy
Histology. On muscle biopsy, a similar picture was found in all
three affected individuals: there was some variability in fiber
size with the presence of mildly hypertrophic and atrophic fi￾bers, and a moderate increase in internal nuclei (Fig. 2 A). There
was no increase in interstitial connective tissue.
Immunocytochemistry. (a) Dystrophin and DAGs. Although
all fibers were continuously labeled with antibodies to dys￾trophin and the 43- and 50-kD DAGs, the intensity of fluores￾cent labeling was paler than in control muscle, as judged by
visual inspection (Fig. 2, C and E and Fig. 3, A and b).
(b) Merosin. Labeling for merosin was normal (not shown).
(c) Utrophin. Antibodies to utrophin showed labeling of all
blood vessels and moderate labeling of the sarcolemma of sev￾eral fibers (Fig. 3 E).
Cardiac biopsy
Histological picture. The histological picture of the cardiac bi￾opsy showed a marked variability of fiber size and severe fibro￾sis (Fig. 2 B).
Immunocytochemistry. (a) Dystrophin and DAGs. No immu￾noreactivity was observed with antibodies directed towards the
N-terminal (Fig. 2 D) and mid-rod-region of dystrophin (not
shown). A weak but clear immunoreactivity was observed at
the sarcolemma of each cardiomyocyte using a COOH-terminal
anti-dystrophin antibody (Fig. 2 F). This pattern of dystrophin
expression suggests that this represent the Dp7l dystrophin iso￾form. Immunocytochemistry performed with antibodies to the
43- and 50-kD DAG showed a severe reduction of these two
proteins, as judged by visual evaluation (Fig. 3, B and D). (a)
Merosin. Merosin immunolabeling was normal (not shown). (c)
Utrophin staining showed marked increase in staining at the
periphery of almost every cardiomyocyte (Fig. 3 F).
Reverse transcription and PCR
Co-amplification of the cDNA from normal skeletal and cardiac
muscle using the oligomers for the mid-rod region (exons 30-
33) of dystrophin and for the a2 laminin gene gave the expected
size products in both tissues (Fig. 4). Regarding the patient's
tissues, amplification of both dystrophin and the a2 laminin
chain gene was obtained in the skeletal muscle (Fig. 4); in the
heart, however, no amplification of dystrophin could be ob￾tained (Fig. 4).
Regarding the transcription of the novel dystrophin L-iso￾form (24), no amplification was obtained after a single course
of PCR in the various samples analyzed (normal skeletal and
cardiac muscle, lymphocytes, Fig. 5). A band of the expected
size (also including exon two, and therefore in contrast to what
previously reported) (24), was detectable only after a second
round of PCR in the lymphocytes but not in the other tissues,
including the patient's material (Fig. 5).
The Dp71 mRNA was amplified from normal fetal muscle,

and at similar levels from adult cardiac muscle and from the
heart biopsy of the XLDCM family member studied (Fig. 6).
No amplification of the same transcript was detected in the
skeletal muscle of various members of the XLDCM family, nor
in normal skeletal muscle (Fig. 6).
Discussion
Dystrophin is a very large cytoskeletal protein expressed in all
muscle types. While its localization is limited to the cytoplasmic
surface of the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle, it is also expressed
in the T tubules in the cardiac myofibers (27, 28). Mutations in
the dystrophin gene are responsible for both the severe Du￾chenne type muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its milder allelic
variant Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). In contrast to these
two conditions, no clinical evidence of skeletal muscle involve￾ment is present in families with a XLDCM secondary to a
dystrophinopathy. Since in almost all these cases the muscle
promoter is deleted (8, 9), transcription of the muscle isoform
should have theoretically been abolished. However, no muscle
weakness was detected, and dystrophin was visualized using
immunocytochemistry in the muscle of these patients (8, 9).
We have recently characterized the pattern of dystrophin
transcription in our XLDCM family and have found that the
brain and the Purkinje-cerebellar cell isoforms were expressed
at high levels in the skeletal muscle of the affected males (11).
The overexpression of these two isoforms was therefore capable
of preventing muscle degeneration. We have now also charac￾terized the transcription of the recently described L-isoform
(24) and shown that it does not play any significant role in
normal muscle and heart, nor in this XLDCM family.
These studies, however, did not clarify the reason for the
severe cardiac involvement in this XLDCM family. In particu￾A Dystrophin Gene Mutation Selectively Affecting the Heart 695

immunostained with antibodies to the 43-kD (A and B) and the 50-kD (C and D) DAGs, and to utrophin (E and F). Note the mild reduction in
intensity of the DAGs in skeletal muscle, but the more severe reduction in the heart. Utrophin is also expressed in both tissues, but at higher levels
in the cardiac muscle. A, C, E, and F, x 180; B and D, x280.
lar, the brain-type transcript has been shown to be physiologi￾cally expressed in the heart (11, 29) and its expression should
therefore not have been affected by the deletion of the muscle
promoter. In this report we demonstrate, however, that dys￾trophin was not detected immunocytochemically in the heart of
the proband, using anti-dystrophin antibodies directed towards
the NH2-terminal and mid-rod-domain region. In keeping with
these results, no transcription for the same regions could be
seen in the patient's heart.
Dystrophin is associated with a large oligomeric complex
of sarcolemmal proteins, including a-dystroglycan which pro￾vides a link to the extracellular matrix component, laminin (14-
16). Previous studies have indicated that all of these DAGs are
reduced in skeletal muscle of the mdx mouse (30) and in DMD
(31). In BMD the DAGs are only mildly to moderately reduced
and there is a good correlation between the reduction of the
DAGs and dystrophin and the severity of the phenotype
(32, 33).
Immunocytochemical study of the 43- and 50-kD DAGs
performed in this family showed mildly reduced levels in the
skeletal muscle of the affected males. The DAGs immunoreac￾tivity, however, was considerably reduced in the heart, indicat￾ing once again that the absence of dystrophin leads to a defi￾ciency in DAGs. The absence of dystrophin and the deficiency
of the DAGs is likely to render the cardiomyocytes susceptible
to necrosis and this can account for the severe fibrosis we found
in the heart. The levels of utrophin found in the heart were
similar to those found in the DMD skeletal muscle (34). Despite
its presence, however, utrophin did not provide a compensatory
function and did not prevent the dystrophic process in the heart.
Immunocytochemistry performed in the heart using COOH￾terminal anti-dystrophin antibodies showed a weak but clear
sarcolemmal staining in the cardiomyocytes. This signal most
likely resulted from the expression of the dystrophin distal tran￾script Dp7l (12, 13, 26) which is expressed physiologically in
the heart (13). This hypothesis is suggested by the following
696 Muntoni et al.

Figure 4. Co-amplification of merosin (a2 laminin chain gene, 353 bp)

observations: (a) there was no immunoreactivity with antibodies
directed towards other dystrophin domains; (b) there was no
transcription of the mid-rod-region of dystrophin; (c) we suc￾cessfully amplified the Dp7l unique mRNA isoform from the
cardiac biopsy of the patient.
Dp7l is the major DMD gene product in brain and other
nonmuscle tissues. It is undetected in adult skeletal muscle (12,
26) but expressed in the heart (13). The function of this DMD
gene product is still unknown. The predicted amino acid se￾quence shows that Dp7l lacks the spectrin-like domain that
confers a rod-shaped structure to dystrophin and it also lacks
the NH2-terminal domain, which is assumed to bind actin. How￾ever, it contains the COOH-terminal domain, which is the most
conserved domain of dystrophin, and the cysteine-rich domain,
which shares homology with the Ca2+-binding domain of a￾actinin. Since the association of dystrophin with the DAGs is
mediated partly by the cysteine-rich domain and partly by the
COOH-terminal domain (15), it is conceivable that Dp7l is
also associated with the DAGs complex. In keeping with this
hypothesis, Dp7l is associated with the plasma membrane in
muscle (12, 35), and co-localizes with the dystrophin glycopro￾tein complex adjacent to the Z-disk (13). It has also been shown
that overexpression of Dp7 1 in the skeletal muscle of transgenic
mdx mouse is capable of restoring the DAGs levels (36, 37).
In our study we have detected a significant down-regulation
of the DAGs in the cardiac muscle of our XLDCM family,
despite the expression of normal levels of the Dp71 protein.
The DAG levels in the heart of this affected male were similar
to those found in the muscle of individuals with severe BMD,
where some dystrophin, but not the Dp7l is expressed. Our

result therefore indirectly suggests that the physiological levels
of Dp71 partially contribute to the DAG binding in the heart.
This is however not sufficient to avoid the onset and progression
of the cardiac pathology. This might indicate that the role of
Dp7l in the heart is different from that of dystrophin; the fact
Dp7l lacks both the spectrin-like repeats and the actin-binding
domain of dystrophin further reinforces this view. In view of
the partial contribution of Dp7l to the DAG binding, it would
be interesting to verify if the rare DMD patients with a mutation
affecting the production of both the major dystrophin isoforms
and Dp71 suffer from a more severe cardiomyopathy then pa￾tients with mutations affecting the major dystrophin isoforms
in isolation.
The complete absence of the major dystrophin isoforms in
the heart in individuals that express them in the skeletal muscle
has not been reported before. The pattern of dystrophin expres￾sion in the heart of these individuals is similar to that found in
DMD, while in the skeletal muscle it is comparable with that
of a very mild BMD. The most likely explanation for the mecha￾nism of disease in this family is the removal of cis-acting se￾quences essential for transcription of dystrophin in the heart. It
is of interest that these putative sequences had no role on the
Dp71 transcription in the skeletal muscle and heart of our pa￾tient. In particular, the Dp7l mRNA levels in the heart of the
patient were similar to those obtained in the control hearts;
moreover, no upregulation of the Dp71 isoform was detected

in the skeletal muscle of this individual, contrary to what found
for both the brain and Purkinje-cells isoforms. These results
indicate the absence of transcriptional interference between the
5' promoters and the Dp71 promoter. The same deduction can
also be applied to the L-type isoform.
As previously suggested (11), these putative regulatory se￾quences may lie within the very large first dystrophin intron
(38). Analysis of the sequence of this intron has shown regions
of homology to various muscle specific regulatory elements,
such as an "E box" (39), a MEFi binding site (40), and a
MEF2 binding site (41), all involved in binding or enhancing
the function of various members of the helix-loop-helix protein
family (42, 43).
Although members of the helix-loop-helix family, such as
MyoDi or MEF2, are not detected in heart, an "E box" has
been found in the regulatory region of the human cardiac actin
promoter and has been shown to be important for its expression
in myocardiocytes (44). Similarly, a MEF2 site has been identi￾fied in the regulatory region of several genes mainly expressed
in the heart, such as the cardiac troponin T (45, 46) and rat
cardiac myosin light chain-2 gene (47).
Several genes expressed both in the cardiac and skeletal
muscle have recently been shown to have distinct transcriptional
pathways involved in the cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific
gene expression. In this respect the slow/cardiac troponin C
(cTnC) gene is expressed in adult cardiac and slow skeletal
muscle (48) and only transiently in embryonic fast skeletal myo￾tubes (49). While the cTnC gene expression in embryonic skele￾tal muscle is regulated by a skeletal muscle-specific, develop￾mentally regulated transcriptional enhancer located within the
first intron of the gene, a distinct and independent transcriptional
enhancer, located within the immediate 5' flanking region of
the cTnC gene regulates its expression in the heart (50).
It is therefore conceivable that a separate transcriptional
pathway is responsible for dystrophin expression in the skeletal
muscle and heart. The sequences we have already suggested
might be responsible for driving dystrophin transcription in the
heart, as well as others located in the large intron 1.
Further studies aimed at characterizing in detail these puta￾tive sequences are still needed. This information will also be
of value when designing gene therapy strategies for DMD.
In conclusion, our data suggest that the deletion found in
our family with XLDCM selectively affects dystrophin expres￾sion in the heart but not in the skeletal muscle. The Dp71
dystrophin isoform, although expressed in the cardiac tissue, is
not capable of maintaining adequate DAG levels and therefore
of restoring dystrophin function. From our data it is also possi￾ble to hypothesize that other genes that are co-expressed in
skeletal muscle and heart might also undergo selective transcrip￾tional impairment in this latter tissue and therefore are potential
candidates for autosomically inherited dilated cardiomyop￾athies.
