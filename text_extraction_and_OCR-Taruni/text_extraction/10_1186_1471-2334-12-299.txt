Abstract
Background: Some patients have a greater response to viral infection than do others having a similar level of viral
replication. Hypercytokinemia is the principal immunopathological mechanism that contributes to a severer clinical
course in cases of influenza A/H1N1. The benefit produced, or damage caused, by these cytokines in severe disease
is not known. The genes that code for these molecules are polymorphic and certain alleles have been associated
with susceptibility to various diseases. The objective of the present study was to determine whether there was an
association between polymorphisms of TNF, LTA, IL1B, IL6, IL8, and CCL1 and the infection and severity of the illness
caused by the pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico in 2009.
Methods: Case–control study. The cases were patients confirmed with real time PCR with infection by the A/H1N1
pandemic virus. The controls were patients with infection like to influenza and non-familial healthy contacts of the
patients with influenza. Medical history and outcome of the disease was registered. The DNA samples were
genotyped for polymorphisms TNF rs361525, rs1800629, and rs1800750; LTA rs909253; IL1B rs16944; IL6 rs1818879;
IL8 rs4073; and CCL1 rs2282691. Odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. The
logistic regression model was adjusted by age and severity of the illness in cases.
Results: Infection with the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was associated with the following genotypes: TNF rs361525 AA,
OR = 27.00; 95% CI = 3.07–1248.77); LTA rs909253 AG (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.82–10.32); TNF rs1800750 AA
(OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.48–12.64); additionally, LTA rs909253 AG showed a limited statistically significant association
with mortality (p = 0.06, OR = 3.13). Carriers of the TNF rs1800629 GA genotype were associated with high levels of
blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.05); those of the TNF rs1800750 AA genotype, with high levels of creatine
phosphokinase (p=0.05). The IL1B rs16944 AA genotype was associated with an elevated number of leukocytes
(p <0.001) and the IL8 rs4073 AA genotype, with a higher value for PaO2 mm Hg.
Conclusion: The polymorphisms of genes involved in the inflammatory process contributed to the severity of the
clinical behavior of infection by the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus.

Background
The influenza A/H1N1 virus pandemic of 2009 started
in Mexico and then spread worldwide, with an alert level
of pandemic phase 6 declared by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in June of that year [1]. Although
the majority of those infected by the influenza A/H1N1
virus presented mild symptoms that were self-limiting, a
subgroup of patients followed an adverse clinical course,
thus requiring a greater level of medical attention and
more aggressive management [2]. In Mexico the lethal
rate was estimated to be 1.2% for cases of influenza-like
illness (ILI) and 5% for confirmed cases of influenza
A/H1N1 [3]. Some co-morbidities (e.g., immunosuppres￾sion, pre-existing pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, dia￾betes, asthma that requires regular medical attention,
smoking, and obesity) have been demonstrated to in￾crease the risk of hospitalization for infection with influ￾enza A/H1N1 [4,5]. The risk is also augmented in the
second and third trimesters of pregnancy and when treat￾ment with oseltamivir is prescribed five days after the
onset of the illness [6]. In addition, the results of certain
laboratory tests (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
>600 IU/L; hypoxemia (PaO2, <60 mm Hg); C-reactive
protein (CRP), 10 mg/dl; and leukopenia <5000/mm3
)
have been associated with greater mortality from infec￾tion by influenza A/H1N1 virus [7,8].
Through experimental and clinical studies, it has been
determined that the most important pathological mech￾anism in this infection is systemic dysregulation of the
inflammatory response, which is correlated with the se￾verity and progression of the illness [9,10]. The secretion
of cytokines by infected cells appears to be necessary for
the initiation of the immunological response that con￾trols the replication of the virus [11]; in addition, the
presence of immunopathological mechanisms, such as
hypercytokinemia (“cytokine storm”), generally is consid￾ered to contribute to the severest evolution of the in￾fection [11-13]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-9, IL-12 IL-15, and IL-17) have been found, up
to ten days after the onset of symptoms, in the plasma
of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 [9,10,14]. The
genes that code for these molecules are polymorphic
and certain alleles have been associated with susceptibility
to various diseases that cover a wide range of pathologies,
from infectious to oncological, including pulmonary and
systemic diseases [15-30]. The role that the polymorph￾isms of the genes encoding these cytokines play in the
severity of the disease is not clear.
The extensive polymorphism of these molecules may
be associated with the high mortality rate during the
2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. Because
we think that genetic factors of the host may influence
the nature and intensity of the inflammatory immune
response, the objective of this study was to determine
whether the polymorphisms of genes that are asso￾ciated with inflammation may be associated with the
development of the infection and with the clinical sever￾ity in Mexican mestizo patients with influenza A/H1N1.
Methods
The rapid QuickVue Influenza A+B test (Quidel, San
Diego, CA, USA) was used to analyze the nasopharyn￾geal swab samples obtained from the patients in 94 cases
of suspected infection by influenza A/H1N1, following
the recommendations for collection and testing of the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and of the WHO [31,32]. The patients were then se￾parated into two groups: those positive for influenza
A/H1N1 (A/H1N1 group) and those negative, as hav￾ing influenza-like illness (ILI group). A total of 44
patients were positive for the influenza A/H1N1 virus
(A/H1N1 group); the remaining 50 patients who had
tested negative for the influenza A/H1N1 virus, were
diagnosed as having influenza-like illness (ILI).
In addition, a group of 176 asymptomatic healthy
contacts (AHC group) voluntarily participated in the
study. Those in the AHC group, although not biologic￾ally related to any patient, were in personal contact
with at least one of the patients during the period of
the illness. To ensure that those in the AHC group
had been exposed to the virus, their titers of anti￾influenza A/H1N1 antibodies were determined. To
evaluate the presence of antibody, we use haemagglu￾tination inhibition technique (HAI); contacts exhibited
significant titers of specific anti-A/H1N1 antibodies,
supporting the fact that they were in contact with the
A/H1N1 virus. By serially diluted aliquots of serum
samples; those individuals with titers greater than 1:16
were considered positive for A/H1N1 infection/exposure.
The two patient groups and the AHC group were Mexican
mestizos (age range: 18–85 years). All patients suspected
of influenza A/H1N1 infection were treated with anti-viral
therapy (oseltamivir) upon admittance at the hospital.
The information collected in this study included
demographic, clinical history, laboratory test data,
pharmacological treatment, and follow-up. This study
was approved by the Institutional Committee of Science
and Bioethics of the National Institute of Respiratory
Diseases (code B05-10). The study protocol was
explained to all participants and signed informed con￾sent was duly obtained from each participant. This infor￾mation was obtained by means of a clinical form in
accord with Official Mexican Standards Mexicana
NOM-168-SSA1-1998; topics covered included age; gen￾der; tobacco smoking; body-mass index (BMI; patients
with BMI >30 k/m2
); and disease morbidity (pulmonary,

hepatic, renal, cardiac, neurological diseases, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, and cancer). The symptoms eval￾uated were fever, cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, nasal con￾gestion, thoracic pain, headache, diarrhea, and vomiting.
The begin of anti-viral therapy was evaluated in relation
to the days with previous symptomatology. The labora￾tory parameters included were leukocyte titer; lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH); creatine phosphokinase (CPK);
blood urea nitrogen (BUN); and arterial gases (with
PaO2 <60 mm Hg defined as severe disease). Pneumo￾nia was verified by radiological findings. All patients
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those
put on assisted mechanical ventilation (AMV) were
identified.
Genotyping of allelic variants (single nucleotide
polymorphism, SNPs)
The DNA samples were genotyped for polymorphisms
TNF rs361525, rs1800629, and rs1800750; LTA rs909253;
IL1B rs16944; IL6 rs1818879; IL8 rs4073; and CCL1
rs2282691 using Taqman commercial probes (Apliedd
Biosystems, USA) the primers listed in Table 1. In brief,
the procedure for the real time PCR was the following:
15 ng DNA; 15 μL of Taqman universal PCR master mix
(Roche NJ, USA) and 6.5 μL of each probes. The condi￾tions for amplification were the following: 94°C (3 min),
61°C (1 min), and 72°C (1 min); followed by 35 cycles of
94°C (1 min), 61°C (1 min), and 72°C (1 min,); and a final
cycle of 94°C (1 min), 61°C (1 min), and 72°C (5 min).
The genetic data for the SNPs were analyzed and are
listed in Table 2.
Analysis
When the polymorphisms were evaluated, the ancestral
genotype was used for comparison. The odds ratio (OR)
and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calcu￾lated. In the logistic regression model, the OR was
adjusted by age and severity of the illness. The χ2 test
was used to evaluate the differences between the propor￾tions of the groups. The differences among the clinical
parameters, continuous variables, and polymorphisms
were evaluated by using the Mann–Whitney U test. Soft￾ware packages SPSS 19 (IBM, Chicago, IL) and Epi-Info
6.04b were used (Atlanta, CDC).
Results
The patients were separated into two groups depending
whether they were positive or negative for influenza
A/H1N1, thereby forming the groups, influenza A/H1N1
and ILI, respectively. In both the A/H1N1 and ILI
groups, the majority was male (68.0% and 58.0%, respect￾ively), whereas in the AHC group, 61.93% were female.
The mean age of the A/H1N1 and ILI groups was <45
years (68.18% and 60.0%, respectively), compared to
that of the AHC group, 56.82% of who were 45–64 years
of age.
The data concerning the demographics, co-morbidities,
and symptomatology for both groups of patients are
presented in Table 3. Interestingly, the mortality was
higher for patients with infection by influenza A/H1N1
than for those with ILI (34.09% vs. 4.0%, respectively;
P<0.001); similarly, hospitalization in the ICU was
more frequent for the influenza A/H1N1 group
(54.55% vs. 30.0%, respectively; p = 0.01). No statisti￾cally significant differences were found for any of the
other variables analyzed. Of the influenza A/H1N1
patients, 93.3% had radiographic signs of pulmonary
compromise, with a statistically significant difference

between the two groups of patients (p = 0.043; data
not shown).
Analysis of genetic association
Genotyping was carried out for eight SNPs from six
genes, the protein products of which have been asso￾ciated with inflammatory processes. The genetic infor￾mation of the polymorphisms that were evaluated is
presented in Table 4. An appreciation of the genetic con￾tribution to the risk of infection by influenza A/H1N1
was obtained by evaluating genotype and alleles of both
patient groups and comparing the frequencies of the
genotypes and alleles with those of the AHC group.
For the A/H1N1 and AHC groups, of the eight SNPs
used, 24 genotype products were generated; in the ILI
group, only 23 genotypes were determined, as the geno￾type AA does not exist for the rs361525 of the gene
TNF. For the A/H1N1 group, five genotypes associated
with risk were identified (p <0.05; OR >2.0). Of particu￾lar interest was the finding of homozygous A genotype
in SNPs rs361525 and rs1800750 in TNF, both with
values of OR >5.0. In addition, the genotypes rs2282691
AA, rs4073 AT, and rs909253 CT (CCL1, IL8, and LTA,
respectively) demonstrated statistically significant asso￾ciation with risk. For the ILI group, three of the five
associations previously reported for the A/H1N1 group
were found. It is of note that these associations, which
coincided in both patient groups, showed statistically
significant data (p values and OR) that were very simi￾lar. On the other hand, our findings demonstrated the
existence of three genotypes with association to protection
(p <0.05; OR ≤1.0): IL1B rs16944 AA, LTA rs909253, and
TNF rs1800750 GG, in both patient groups, as compared
to the AHC group (Table 4).
In the analysis of alleles, two signs that showed statisti￾cally significant association with risk were found: allele
A of rs2282691 of CCL1 was shown to be increased in
both patient groups (A/H1N1, p <0.05; ILI, p <0.01),
when the allelic frequency (AF) of each patient group
was compared with that of the AHC group (OR = 2.15

and 2.11, respectively). Also, rs1800750 allele A, one of
the three polymorphisms evaluated for TNF, showed a
similar behavior, that is, an association with risk in both
patient groups (A/H1N1, p <0.01; ILI, p <0.01). No other
association was found for the remaining six SNPs ana￾lyzed (Table 5).

Mortality
The genotype AG of rs909253 in LTA showed a tendency
to be associated with mortality (OR = 3.13), with p = 0.06
just above the limit of statistical significance. Table 6
presents the data for the different genotypes evaluated
with respect to mortality. The data corresponding to
the allelic OR were carried out for both alleles; how￾ever, only those carried out for the ancestral allele are
shown. No data for the remaining alleles or genotypes
studied were statistically significant. The logistic
regression analysis, after adjusting for levels of PaO2
and for admission to the ICU, showed no statistically
significant association between the genotypes and
mortality.

Polymorphisms and laboratory tests
No changes in laboratory parameters were found with
respect to the genotypes of the SNPs in TNF rs361525,
LTA rs909253, CCL1 rs2282691, or IL6 rs1818879
(Additional file 1: Table S1). For the homozygous geno￾type AA of rs16944 in IL1B, an elevated number of leu￾kocytes was found (mean: 44.9 × 103
/mm3
), whereas
for the heterozygous genotype AG and the homo￾zygous genotype GG, the mean titer values were
8.62 ×103
/mm3 and 6.96 ×103
/mm3
, respectively
(p <0.001). The genotype AG in rs1800629 in TNF
was associated with elevated levels of BUN (33mg/dl),
whereas for the genotype GG, the BUN levels were
lower (p =0.05) (Additional file 1: Table S1). The geno￾type AA of rs1800750 in TNF showed high levels of
CPK (mean: 2246.25 IU/L), whereas the genotypes GG
and AG had mean values of 366.32 IU/L and 450.00
IU/L, respectively (p=0.05).
Discussion
Although it has been reported that some of the genes
involved in inflammation are associated with pulmonary
and infectious diseases [16,17,21,25-28], to date, no direct
association between these polymorphisms and infection
by influenza A/H1N1 virus has been reported. In the
present study, the logistic regression analysis of cases and
controls showed that TNF rs361525 (AA), rs1800750
(AA), and LTA rs909253 (AG) were associated with high
risk of infection by pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Al￾though mortality of the A/H1N1 patients was greater than
that of the ILI patients (p <0.001), only genotype AG of
LTA rs909253 demonstrated an association with mortality
(p = 0.06) just missing being statistically significant. This
finding may indicate that being a carrier of genotype AG
LTA at rs909253 entails a poorer prognosis for this illness.
Some biomarkers, such as CRP, LDH, leukopenia, and
hypoxemia [7,8] have been considered as predictors for

severe illness by influenza A/H1N1 virus. In this study,
we found that elevated values of laboratory test para￾meters (BUN, CPK, and leukocyte titer) were associated
with TNF (rs1800629 AG, rs1800750 AA), and IL1B
(genotype AA). These results may indicate that being a
carrier of these polymorphisms in particular may be
associated with severer organic damage by infection by
influenza A/H1N1 virus. However, in the case of IL8, the
homozygous AA appeared to offer a certain degree of
protection against severe illness; this may be explained,
in part, by the association of a higher concentration of
oxygen in the blood (PaO2 >60 mm Hg) with this
genotype.
Although susceptibility for presenting an adverse clin￾ical course (i.e., sepsis, septic shock, multiples organ fail￾ure, or death) varies due to different degrees of
inflammatory response [30], genetic factors of the host
may influence the nature and intensity of this response.
The present study is the first to demonstrate that the
polymorphisms in genes related to the inflammatory re￾sponse may, in some manner, be influencing the risk of
infection by influenza A/H1N1 virus and of death from
this illness. One possible mechanism may be the forma￾tion of disequilibria in the bond between alleles, creating
haplotypes that differentially affect the expression and
activity of cytokines and chemokines, thereby resulting
in a severer clinical course for the infection.
To avoid variability in our results, we studied a homo￾geneous population of Mexican mestizos. Although the
sampling size was a limitation in our study, we were able
to demonstrate statistically significant differences in the
distribution of genotypes in terms of infection, mortality,
and biomarkers between cases and controls, thus sug￾gesting a strong association with the illness. However,
infection by influenza A/H1N1 virus is a very complex
illness that involves not only the association of environ￾mental factors and the genetic make-up and biology of
the individual per se, but also the presence of co￾morbidities that may contribute to a greater severity of
the illness [4,5].
We had limitations. For example, contacts exhibited
significant titers of specific anti-A/H1N1 antibodies,
supporting the fact that they were in contact with the
A/H1N1 virus. Additionally is necessary clear that is not
a patients group, we just include unrelated contacts in
this study (e.g. family in law persons, home workers,
etc.). They were in close contact with patients when the
latter exhibited acute respiratory illness. None of these
household contacts developed respiratory illness. How￾ever, the presence of antibody would not confirm infec￾tion with A/H1N1 virus because there is the likelihood
of cross-reactivity [33]. But, when a person with posi￾tivity of antibodies that had contact with an A/H1N1
virus infected patient, the infection cannot be excluded
[34]. The gold standard for identifying the infection to
A/H1N1 virus is real time PCR test; however to identify
the presence of the virus in symptomatic patients is
necessary that the patients be assessed during the first
days from the beginning of the disease, the probability
of identifying the virus by molecular test in asymptom￾atic patients is very low and not practical [35].
With the high mortality rate from the 2009 influenza
A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico [31], the approach used in
this work could acquire great importance, as the study
of polymorphisms may be useful in predicting the con￾duct that the infection would follow during future out￾breaks of influenza A/H1N1 in Mexico.
Conclusions
The TNF polymorphisms studied were associated with
risk of infection by influenza A/H1N1 virus during the
pandemic in Mexico in 2009. These genetic variants
may contribute to the severest clinical manifestations in
Mexican mestizos.
