Antibodies are a vital part of the armamentarium of the adaptive immune system for the
fine-tuning of the recognition and response to foreign threats. However, in health there
are some types of antibodies that instead recognize self-antigens and these contribute
to the enhancement of primitive innate functions. This repertoire of natural IgM antibod￾ies is postulated to have been selected during immune evolution for their contributions
to critical immunoregulatory and housekeeping properties. The clearance of dying cells
is one of the most essential responsibilities of the immune system, which is required
to prevent uncontrolled inflammation and autoimmunity. In the murine immune system,
natural IgM antibodies that recognize apoptotic cells have been shown to enhance the
phagocytic clearance of dead and dying cells and to suppress innate immune signaling
pathways. In the mouse, natural IgM are often the products of B-1 cell clones that arise
during immune development without an absolute requirement for exogenous antigenic
stimulation. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, IgM autoantibodies, which
bind to neo-epitopes on apoptotic cells, have been demonstrated to be present at sig￾nificantly higher levels in patients with lower disease activity and with less severe organ
damage. While certain specificities of IgM autoantibodies correlate with protection from
lupus renal disease, others may convey protective properties from lupus-associated ather￾osclerotic cardiovascular disease. New and unexpected insights into the functional roles
of IgM antibodies are still emerging, especially regarding the functions of natural anti￾bodies. Herein, we review recent progress in our understanding of the potential roles of
natural IgM autoantibodies in the regulation of immune homeostasis and for protection
from autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

INTRODUCTION
While the innate immune system is more ancient, the adaptive
immune system first arose more recently with the appearance of
cartilaginous fish (reviewed in Dooley and Flajnik, 2006). IgM is
the most evolutionary conserved antibody isotype, and present in
all vertebrates, and it is also the earliest isotype to be expressed
during immune development. In the mouse up to 80% of circu￾lating IgM derive from B-1 cells (Baumgarth et al., 1999), which
is a distinct B-cell subset that is uncommon in peripheral lym￾phoid tissues but highly represented amongst mononuclear cells in
the peritoneal and pleural cavities (Hayakawa et al., 1986). While
the largest population of mature B cells, follicular B cells (also
termed B-2 cells), are primarily responsible for T-cell dependent
immune responses, both marginal zone B cells and B-1 cells rep￾resent mature lymphocyte subsets that are involved in innate-like
responses, with more rapid responses to non-protein antigens.
Although there may be some overlap in their functional roles, B￾1 cells and marginal zone B cells have many distinct phenotypic
and functional features (Martin et al., 2001; Martin and Kear￾ney, 2002). In a recent study, precursors for B-1 cells were also
found in adult murine spleen, and these significantly differed in
their phenotypes from those of marginal zone B cells and con￾ventional follicular B cells (Ghosn et al., 2011). There may also
be some plasticity in the differentiation capacity of the progen￾itors for these three major types of mature B cells (Tung et al.,
2006).
The unique functions of B-1 cells are linked to their specialized
surface phenotype and signaling thresholds, and their capacity to
be recruited into T-cell independent responses following challenge
with certain non-protein antigens (reviewed in Baumgarth, 2011).
In fact,in the mouse B-1 cells two subsets with distinct surface phe￾notypes have been identified, B-1a and B-1b. B-1 cells are a major
source of antibodies that are constitutively secreted without prior
immune activation (Baumgarth et al., 2005; Holodick et al., 2010).
These secreted immunoglobulins have been termed “natural anti￾bodies” as these types of antibodies may be present from birth
without external antigenic exposure, which stand in contrast to
“immune” antibodies that arise after specific immune exposure or
antigenic challenge. In mice, secreted natural IgM is generated by
B-1 cells predominantly in the spleen, and to a lesser extent in the
bone marrow. A recent report argued that splenic IgM-producing
B-1 cells are distinctly different from the B-1 cells found in the
peritoneal cavity that only express very small amounts of secreted
IgM (Choi et al., 2012), although this topic remains controver￾sial. Mice raised under germ-free conditions, and fed a diet that
is free from foreign antigens, still develop a normal IgM natural

antibody repertoire, which suggests that other factors are involved
in the clonal selection of B-1 cells (Bos et al., 1989; Haury et al.,
1997).
At a genetic and structural level, the murine B-1 cell pool,which
is a major source of natural antibodies, is enriched for a recur￾rent repertoire that includes an overrepresentation of VH11 and
VH12 heavy chain variable region rearrangements, and preferential
H–L chain pairing, that have been associated with an autoreac￾tive binding specificity (Hardy et al., 1989; Mercolino et al., 1989;
Wang and Clarke, 2004; Rowley et al., 2007). Natural antibodies
from B-1 cells are reported to be often encoded by germline vari￾able gene segments unaffected by somatic hypermutation (Kantor
et al., 1997). The repertoire of murine B-1 cell derived antibodies is
also reported to less commonly include rearrangements with non￾templated nucleotide additions (i.e., N-insertions) in their V–D
and D–J junctions (Herzenberg et al., 2000). An absence of N￾insertions in the CDR3 associated splice sites may reflect a clonal
origin of B-1 cell precursors in the fetal liver, an early site of B￾lymphogenesis in which murine B-cell precursors do not express
the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) for this somatic
mechanism of the Ig repertoire.
Host defenses have also been shown to benefit from B￾1 cell responses to common microbial pathogens (Baumgarth
et al., 2005). Yet, there is mounting evidence that natural IgM
antibodies also contribute to critical innate immune functions
involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. As described
in the following sections, these functions include augmenting
the clearance of apoptotic cells and the reinforcement of mech￾anisms involved in protection from the development of autoim￾mune disease (Chen et al., 2009a,b; reviewed in Silverman et al.,
2009).
AUTOREACTIVITY OF NATURAL ANTIBODIES
The immune system is tightly regulated at several checkpoints dur￾ing lymphocyte differentiation by strict mechanisms that weed out
clones with the potential for pathogenic self-reactive responses.
These checkpoints serve to prevent the development of autoim￾mune disease. However, it is now accepted that certain types of
autoreactive immune cells and antibodies are common in health,
and accumulating evidence suggest that autoreactive antibodies
can play important roles in tissue homeostasis. While in some
cases the binding interactions of natural IgM clones are of rather
low affinity, and the same antibody can display polyreactivity for a
range of ligands (Casali and Notkins, 1989), another type of nat￾ural antibody can display great mono-specificity for its binding
self-ligand.
A major set of natural antibodies specifically binds to oxidation￾associated neo-determinants that become exposed on apoptotic
cells (Chou et al., 2009), but which are not displayed on healthy
cells. Despite the complexity of the apoptotic cell membrane, two
types of neo-self epitopes appear to dominate in vivo murine
immune responses to apoptotic cells; the headgroup of oxi￾dized lipids, phosphorylcholine (PC), and the small oxidation￾associated determinant, malondialdehyde (MDA), which is chem￾ically active and can become an adduct on proteins. Recent studies
have shown that more than 50% of the splenic IgM-secreting
cells induced by infusions of apoptotic cells recognize these two
sets of epitopes (Chen et al., 2009b). In addition, studies have
shown that other types of antibodies can instead bind unrelated
apoptotic cell associated neo-epitopes, which include cardiolipin,
phosphatidylserine, and Annexin IV (Tuominen et al., 2006; Fu
et al., 2007; Kulik et al., 2009; Kim, 2010).
The best characterized type of natural antibody has the capac￾ity for specific immune recognition of phosphorylcholine (PC)-
containing antigens, which are present and accessible on apop￾totic cell membranes and in oxidized LDL, as well as represent
the immunodominant epitope in the pneumococcal bacterial cell
wall polysaccharide (Shaw et al., 2000; Friedman et al., 2002;
Chou et al., 2009). In host cell membranes, PC represents a
head group in neutral phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine.
However, in healthy cells, the PC head group is held in a confor￾mation that makes it inaccessible for recognition and binding by
antibodies, while during apoptotic death oxidative modifications
can result in changes in the overall conformation of the mole￾cule that enable the immune recognition of the PC-containing
phospholipid determinants.
In the murine immune system, of the many hundreds of inher￾ited VH gene segments, most natural antibodies to PC utilize
the VHS107.1 gene, which is rearranged to encode for the above
described deep antigen-binding cleft for the PC moiety that is
highly prevalent in the B-1 repertoire. As a consequence, other￾wise immunocompetent mice, which have been engineered to be
deficient in this single VH gene segment, have highly impaired
immune responses to the PC determinants on both apoptotic
cells and on bacteria (Mi et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2009b).
Crystallographic studies, which have elucidated the structural
basis for the formation of the PC binding site of this type of
natural antibody, have therefore demonstrated how evolution￾ary forces can select for an optimized innate-like B-cell antigen
receptor (BCR) antigen-binding site that is highly and recur￾rently expressed within the murine B-1 repertoire (Satow et al.,
1986).
There is also a distinct set of natural antibodies that binds to
determinants that arise on erythrocytes during their senescence
or after red cell enzymatic treatment with a protease, brome￾lain (Cox and Hardy, 1985; Mercolino et al., 1986; Hardy and
Hayakawa, 2005). Because these cells are devoid of nuclei as well
as mitochondria, the aging, or senescence of mature red cells is
not associated with membrane modifications induced by caspase￾dependent apoptosis-associated pathways that affect other types of
cells in the body. Instead, red cell membranes appear to undergo a
different type of senescence associated changes, which can be rec￾ognized by natural antibodies. These anti-red cell antibodies are
reported to recognize determinants that involve the entire phos￾phatidylcholine (PtC) molecule in the outer cell membranes, and
not associated with isolated PC-containing antigens. Yet, it has
been unclear whether these binding interactions involve a spe￾cial type of modification of PtC. Alternatively, these interactions
may also result from the loss of erythrocyte membrane-associated
proteins, which thereby increase the accessibility of antibodies to
PtC-containing determinants. In summary, in the mouse there are
two major and distinct subsets of autoreactive natural antibodies,
which recognize senescent red cells, or other types of cells undergo￾ing apoptotic death. These different antibody sets are postulated to

Grönwall et al. Protective roles of natural IgM antibodies
fulfill different functional roles, which together reinforce immune
homeostasis (see below).
The antibody repertoire of B-1 cells appears to arise due to
specialized differences in the signaling thresholds of this lympho￾cyte subset, and the BCR mediated responses in B-1 cells have
different cellular fate outcomes than occur for follicular B cells.
Encounter of a B-1 cell precursor with its cognate self-antigen
may result in a positive selection process that leads to clonal
selection and expansion, while such encounters by a conven￾tional follicular B-cell commonly result in activation-associated
cell death (Pillai et al., 2004). Such a B-1 cell associated process
has been documented in vivo with primary B cells that express
an Ig-transgene that encodes for recognition of an epitope on the
glyco-conjugate associated Thy-1 determinant (Hayakawa et al.,
1999). Taken together, the data show that while some B-1 cell
derived natural antibodies are inherently polyreactive, other B￾1 cell clones display highly selective binding specificities. As a
consequence, the repertoire of IgM natural autoantibodies is not
randomly generated but instead includes highly represented recur￾rent clonotypes. Studies in the mouse have been interpreted as
evidence that the early B-cell repertoire arises following a devel￾opmentally determined sequence (Perlmutter et al., 1985), which
we argue has been selected in part to play beneficial homeostatic
functions. Furthermore, this process of B-1 cell associated positive
selection may also explain the reported relative homogeneity in the
IgM natural autoantibody repertoire expressed between different
individual mice of the same strain (Seidl et al., 1997; Vasconcellos
et al., 1998), and may also be responsible for the strikingly uni￾form natural IgM binding reactivity profiles reported in human
newborns (Merbl et al., 2007; Madi et al., 2009).
The features of autoreactive IgM natural antibodies that arise
in a healthy individual may differ fundamentally from the high￾affinity somatically mutated IgG autoantibodies that can arise
during an autoimmune disease, in part because B-1 cell products
are not commonly recruited into T-cell dependent germinal center
reactions. Furthermore, functional properties of IgM antibodies
are also distinct because the μ constant region of IgM is devoid of
the functional capacities for the triggering of activating Fcγ recep￾tors associated with certain IgG subclasses. In health, the B-1 cell
responses are generally limited to switching to an IgG subclass that
has little or no FcγR binding activity (i.e., murine IgG3).
B-1 cells are reported to be a major contributor to the gut￾associated lymphoid tissues, often following class switch of the
constant region to IgA (Kroese and Bos, 1999; Stoel et al., 2005).
B-1 cell derived IgA antibodies have been shown to aid the clear￾ance of microbes from the gut lumen (Kroese et al., 1989), and IgA
secreted into the gut can therefore influence the relative represen￾tation of microbial species within the microbiome. Using a systems
biology approach, Matzinger and co-workers recently described a
three-way interaction between IgA responses in the gut, the rep￾resentation of microbiota species, and the functional properties
and activation level of intestinal epithelium (Shulzhenko et al.,
2011). The intertwined dependence of these different compo￾nents of host defenses with the internal microbiota milieu are
speculated to determine overall immune competency, and no
doubt represents a topic that will merit further examination in
the future.
PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTION
Natural IgM antibodies are reported to recognize a wide range of
different microbial components, which include viral antigens and
bacterial toxins (Ochsenbein et al., 1999). The broad reactivity pat￾tern of the natural antibodies may therefore help to protect against
a variety of pathogens not previously encountered. Due in part to
the high avidity of polymeric IgM, these may contribute to the
initial immune defense and to the control of invading pathogens
until the immune system has time to launch a specific adaptive
response (reviewed in Baumgarth et al., 2005). In certain cases,
the B-1 expressed IgM antibodies have been shown to directly neu￾tralize or inhibit pathogens as well as aid the initiation of adaptive
immune responses from follicular B cells, which together play crit￾ical roles in protection against bacterial and viral infections (Boes
et al., 1998; Ochsenbein et al., 1999; Baumgarth et al., 2000; Haas
et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2007). As mentioned above, the repertoire
of natural antibodies also enables recognition of non-protein self￾antigens such as phosphorylcholine (PC), phosphatidylcholine
(PtC), and carbohydrate determinants, and that in some cases
these antibodies are capable of cross-reactivity with structurally
related epitopes on microbes. Due to the importance of autore￾active antibodies in apoptotic cell clearance, the self-recognition
properties of these antibodies may be just as important for the
host as pathogen recognition.
INNATE IMMUNE FUNCTION AND THE PHAGOCYTIC
CLEARANCE OF APOPTOTIC CELLS
One of the most fundamental functions of the immune system is
the recognition and removal of the large number of dying cells that
are continually generated in our bodies. Even in adults, hundreds
of billions of cells die each day and are continually replaced. Cells
dying from apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, undergo
an active energy-dependent cascade that is highly controlled,
resulting in cell shrinkage, protein cleavage, DNA breakdown, and
extensive plasma membrane changes specific for apoptosis. These
apoptotic cells are cleared by phagocytosis by macrophages in a
process that has been termed efferocytosis, for taking out the dead
(deCathelineau and Henson, 2003). This mechanism is required
for normal tissue homeostasis as it prevents the accumulation of
cells that would otherwise progress to secondary necrosis and the
release of autoantigens and pro-inflammatory factors such as the
high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) protein (Scaffidi et al.,
2002), uric acid, heat-shock proteins, and S100 proteins (Hof￾mann et al., 1999; Basu et al., 2000; Scaffidi et al., 2002; Shi et al.,
2003; reviewed in Kono and Rock, 2008). While apoptotic cells do
not themselves pose a risk to the host, their cell membranes in
fact contain components that can be anti-inflammatory. Hence,
in vivo treatment with apoptotic cells have been shown to inhibit
inflammatory responses in murine models (Huynh et al., 2002;
Gray et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009a).
There are many factors produced by the innate immune system
that act as what have been termed “eat-me signals” (i.e., tags for
apoptotic cells for recognition by immune cells), which include
C1q, mannose binding lectin (MBL), collectins, and pentraxins
(reviewed in Ravichandran and Lorenz, 2007; Devitt and Marshall,
2011). Yet, certain B-1 cell clones secrete IgM natural antibodies
specific for determinants that become exposed on apoptotic cells,

Grönwall et al. Protective roles of natural IgM antibodies
but which are not present on healthy cells (Shaw et al., 2003), and
there is increasing evidence that the specific recognition of dying
cells by natural antibodies can play an important role in integrat￾ing and coordinating these processes (reviewed in Silverman et al.,
2009). The essential role of IgM for the clearance of apoptotic cells
has been well established (Ogden et al., 2005; Quartier et al., 2005;
Chen et al., 2009a,b) and incubation with polyclonal IgM has been
demonstrated to also promote clearance of apoptotic micropar￾ticles released from dying cells (Litvack et al., 2011) as well as
enhance the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in the lungs by alveo￾lar macrophages (Litvack et al., 2010). Indeed, mice engineered to
be deficient in IgM have defects in the clearance of apoptotic cells
(Chen et al., 2009a; Notley et al., 2011) and have increased suscep￾tibility to develop a lupus-like syndrome with expression of IgG
autoantibodies to nuclear antigens (Boes et al., 2000). Importantly,
recent studies have shown that there are certain IgM clones that are
essential for mediating the immunoregulatory effects of apoptotic
cells (Chen et al., 2009a,b). Natural IgM has also recently been
reported to enhance apoptotic cell phagocytosis in the marginal
zone of the spleen and promote IL-10-secreting B and T cells that
restrain the development of inflammation (Notley et al., 2011).
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that a murine mono￾clonal IgM produced by a B-1 cell derived cell line, with identical
antibody gene usage to the classic T15 clone, which binds to PC
determinants on apoptotic cells, also has potent anti-inflammatory
properties (Chen et al., 2009a,b). This clone produces a proto￾typic natural antibody that expresses non-hypermutated canonical
VHS107.1 and Vκ22 L chain rearrangements, and T15 clono￾typic B-1 cells spontaneously arise in the first week of life even
under germ-free conditions (Sigal et al., 1975; Gearhart et al.,
1977). The binding of IgM anti-PC to apoptotic cells leads to
the formation of complexes with the recruitment of the early
complement factors involved in ligand recognition, C1q, and the
structurally related MBL (Chen et al., 2009a,b). As mentioned
above, C1q and MBL can represent “eat-me” signals for innate
immune cells to recognize and respond to apoptotic cell mem￾branes (Korb and Ahearn, 1997; Navratil et al., 2001; Ogden et al.,
2001; Stuart et al., 2005). The binding interactions of the comple￾ment molecules directly with apoptotic cell surface are not fully
characterized, but in one system C1q was shown to directly inter￾act with determinants such as phosphatidylserine (PS; Paidassi
et al., 2008). As reported recently, in some settings, this depo￾sition of C1q onto apoptotic cells can be immunomodulatory
and inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fraser
et al., 2009). Recent studies have shown that these properties may
be amplified when higher levels of C1q are recruited by IgM
that is complexed with apoptotic cells (Chen et al., 2009a,b).
The binding of IgM to apoptotic cells may similarly enhance
MBL recruitment that leads to the same anti-inflammatory effects
(Chen et al., 2009b). These findings are consistent with evidence
that MBL-deficient mice display defective apoptotic cell clear￾ance although without autoimmune phenotype (Stuart et al.,
2005). In mice, C1q deficiency is also associated with a clearance
defect and it can contribute to accelerated disease in lupus-prone
strains. Moreover, in humans C1q deficiency is associated with
severe lupus-like autoimmune disease (reviewed in Botto andWal￾port, 2002; Lewis and Botto, 2006). These phenotypes have been
suggested to result in part from impaired capacity for apoptotic
cell clearance.
Binding of polymeric IgM to a highly valent antigen, as can
occur with interactions with the surface of an apoptotic cell, alters
the conformation, or accessibility of μ constant region determi￾nants, which enables binding of the large polymeric macromole￾cule, C1q. In turn, this complexed C1q may become available to
interact with C1q receptors, and the complex can also initiate the
capacity for associated C1 esterases to activate downstream com￾plement components (Perkins et al., 1991; Czajkowsky and Shao,
2009).While C1q in plasma is directly and preferentially deposited
on late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells, IgM that recognize
apoptotic cell membranes can facilitate the enhanced recruitment
of C1q and thereby mediate the phagocytosis of cells at an earlier
stage of apoptosis than incubation with C1q alone. Similarly MBL
molecules, which are structurally related to C1q and share a com￾mon evolutionary origin, can also bind directly to an apoptotic
cell membrane, and these polymeric molecules display enhanced
recruitment by some anti-apoptotic cell IgM antibodies that con￾tain high mannose glycoconjugates (Arnold et al.,2006;Chen et al.,
2009a). Recent studies suggest that C1q and MBL serve as bridging
molecules that trigger specialized phagocyte functions for engulf￾ment and clearance of apoptotic cells, by a pathway that does not
require downstream activation of the complement cascade (Chen
et al., 2009a,b).
Complexes formed of apoptotic cells with the above described
anti-PC IgM antibodies, or with polyclonal IgM that contains a
subset of related antibodies, can also result in strong suppres￾sion of in vivo and in vitro inflammatory responses, including
those induced by ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs; Chen
et al., 2009a). This natural antibody mediated regulatory process,
which requires recruitment of C1q or MBL, involves the block￾ade of TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling by inhibition
of MAPK pathways (unpublished). We hypothesize that these IgM
antibody interactions facilitate the formation of a synapse between
the apoptotic cell and the phagocyte (see Figure 1). This com￾plex enhances the immunoregulatory properties of apoptotic cell
membranes by increasing interactions between the immune cell
and apoptotic cell determinants. This synapse is postulated to
involve both soluble factors and receptors that stabilize the interac￾tions between these cells and receptors, initiating specific signaling
events that result in engulfment and which trigger active anti￾inflammatory responses. Our recent studies have found evidence
that the anti-inflammatory potential of the anti-apoptotic cell IgM
is mediated through a fundamental regulatory immunosuppres￾sive pathway. These findings suggest that the circulating natural
antibodies that target apoptotic cells serve not only to remove
apoptotic cells but may also act as direct immunoregulators.
NATURAL IgM IN MURINE MODELS OF INFLAMMATORY
DISEASE
Vaccinations that induce elevated levels of anti-PC IgM antibod￾ies have been shown to halt the progression of atherosclerosis in
hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor-deficient mice (Binder et al.,
2003). More recent studies have confirmed these findings, as
polyclonal natural IgM treatment reduced atherosclerosis and

lowered levels of potentially pathogenic CD4 + T cells in hyper￾cholesterolemic ApoE−/− mice (Cesena et al., 2012). Studies
have also shown that treatments with monoclonal IgM anti￾dsDNA antibodies can delay the onset of lupus-like disease in
(NZB × NZW)F1 mice (Werwitzke et al., 2005) and lower disease
activity in MRL/lpr mice (Jiang et al., 2011). Moreover, treatments
with a recombinant self-reactive IgM was recently shown to reduce
levels of pro-inflammatory TH17 cells and autoimmune disease in
FcγRIIB/TLR9 deficient mice (Stoehr et al., 2011).
Studies of mice that lack the capacity to produce serum IgM
have helped to elucidate the immunomodulatory roles of secreted
IgM. As mentioned above, in predisposed animals the absence
of IgM leads to enhanced production of pathogenic IgG autoan￾tibodies and autoimmune disease, and in hyperlipidemic mice
IgM-deficiency predisposes to the development of accelerated
atherosclerosis (Boes et al., 2000; Ehrenstein et al., 2000; Lewis
et al., 2009). While it is possible that in these settings, natural
IgM directly acts by neutralization of harmful molecules, increas￾ing evidence suggest that the observed protective properties may
instead derive from a subset of natural IgM that specifically rec￾ognize apoptotic cells, which leads to enhanced efferocytosis and
an active anti-inflammatory response. As described above, in vivo
treatment with the IgM natural antibody to the PC head group
in oxidized lipids on apoptotic cells strongly inhibited inflamma￾tory responses in lymphoid tissues to TLR agonists (Chen et al.,
2009a). In addition, infusions with this anti-apoptotic cell anti￾body suppressed the development of collagen induced arthritis
(CIA), a murine model with many of the key features of rheuma￾toid arthritis, and also suppressed the development of disease in
the anti-collagen antibody passive transfer model (Chen et al.,
2009a).
RECEPTORS FOR IgM ANTIBODIES
The potential roles of different cellular receptors for IgM are a
topic of active investigation. IgM can bind either to the Fcα/μR or
the polymeric Ig receptor (Shibuya et al., 2000; Kaetzel, 2005),
and both of these receptors recognize IgM as well as IgA.
Although the pathways are yet to be fully determined, the Fcα/μR,
expressed on B cells and follicular dendritic cells, has recently been
demonstrated to negatively regulate immune responses against
T-independent antigens, which may have implications for the
functions of natural antibodies (Honda et al., 2009). Fcα/μR
is also upregulated on human macrophages following Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation (Feng et al., 2010). In addition,
CD22 (Siglec-2), an inhibitory co-receptor on B cells, binds to
sialic acid containing glycoconjugates on soluble IgM, and the
TOSO/Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 3 (FAIM3) has recently
been identified as a distinct Fc receptor for IgM expressed on
B cells (Shima et al., 2010). TOSO/FAIM3 may play a role in
immune surveillance and B-cell activation as it acts as an endo￾cytic receptor and internalizes bound IgM and then transport
these complexes into lysosomes for degradation. TOSO has also
been shown to be highly expressed on chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) cells, wherein TLR stimulation induces strong
downregulation of expression levels (Vire et al., 2011). It is cur￾rently unknown whether these receptors affect the activity of
B-1 cells and the functional properties of soluble natural IgM
antibodies.
HUMAN NATURAL IgM AND THEIR PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES
Until recently, the identification and characterization of the
human B-1 subset expressing natural antibodies has been elu￾sive. However, Griffin et al. (2011) have identified a subset of
CD43+ CD27+ mononuclear cells as B-1 cell analogs, which
spontaneously produce natural IgM anti-PC and these cells may be
the predominant source of constitutively produced human IgM.
Further supporting the importance of these cells during immune
development, these cells were found both in healthy adult and
umbilical cord blood. These findings are consistent with evidence
that human natural IgM-autoreactive antibodies are highly rep￾resented in the sera of healthy adults and newborn babies (Merbl
et al., 2007). In fact, studies have shown that up to 50% of periph￾eral blood B cells in newborns and 15–20% of circulating B cells
in adults are polyreactive and potentially express some level of
autoreactivity (Chen et al., 1998). Importantly, a major propor￾tion of natural IgM antibodies in human cord blood recognize
oxidation-specific epitopes that can mediate binding of apoptotic
cells (Chou et al., 2009).
IgM antibodies to the oxidation-associated epitopes, PC, and
MDA, which arise on apoptotic cells, are also commonly expressed
in healthy humans (Silverman et al., 2008). In clinical surveys,
while levels of IgM anti-PC can vary more than 100-fold between
different persons (Padilla et al., 2004), serum IgM anti-PC reac￾tivity detected in ELISA assays strongly correlated with the level
of IgM in the sera that binds to apoptotic cells (Padilla et al.,
2004). Furthermore, IgM anti-PC in healthy adults was shown to
be generally stable over a 6-week survey period (Padilla et al.,
2004). It can be hypothesized that in many acute inflamma￾tory conditions there may be a milieu associated with an acute
accumulation of higher levels of apoptotic cells, which would
result in reduced levels of IgM anti-PC due to consumption
of these circulating, primarily intravascular, molecules. In sup￾port, following isolated limb perfusion with TNF-alpha for local

treatment of solid tumors, levels of circulating IgM anti-PC were
decreased by up to 60% at 48 h after treatment (Padilla et al.,
2004).
Studies of SLE discordant twins have shown that higher lev￾els of IgM anti-PC are often present in the healthy twin, which
was speculated to represent how IgM antibodies to apoptotic cells
may provide protection from autoimmune disease in genetically
predisposed individuals (Silverman et al., 2008). Yet, in surveys
of 120 unrelated patients with SLE of diverse ethnic background,
although there was great variability between individuals, lupus
patients were shown to have significantly higher levels of anti￾PC antibodies compared to unrelated healthy controls, which was
proposed to reflect a compensatory mechanism to the higher state
of systemic inflammation and increased chronic immune expo￾sure to apoptotic cells (Gronwall et al., 2012). Significantly, higher
levels of PC anti-IgM correlated with lower disease activity and
organ damage (Gronwall et al., 2012), which is consistent with an
earlier report in a smaller Swedish cohort (Su et al., 2008). These
data therefore support the hypothesis that IgM anti-PC antibodies
may play protective roles in lupus.
Longitudinal surveys of patients with SLE have also demon￾strated that levels of IgM anti-PC antibodies decreased by a mean
50% decrease over a 15-year period, while total serum IgM, and
levels of other IgM antigen-binding specificities, did not signif￾icantly change (Gronwall et al., 2012). However, it is currently
uncertain whether this reflects the natural history of the disease,
or perhaps the cumulative impact of therapeutic interventions.
Nonetheless, these findings are consistent with the recent results
that the representation of human B-1 cells in the circulation gen￾erally declines in normal individuals with aging (Griffin et al.,
2011). Taken together, these findings may suggest that the capacity
of some individuals to produce certain types of protective IgM
antibodies may wane overtime.
While IgM is the predominant isotype of circulating human
anti-PC antibodies, IgG anti-PC are also commonly present.
Notably, in both healthy individuals and SLE patients, IgG anti-PC
is predominantly of the IgG2 subclass that is associated with a
lower capacity for the triggering by immune complexes of acti￾vating FcγR. Due to the report that the specificity of a murine
monoclonal antibody can be changed from PC to DNA by a sin￾gle point mutation (Diamond and Scharff, 1984), there has been
speculation regarding the potential for antigenic cross-reactivity
of such natural antibody responses, which could have a negative
influence in lupus predisposed individuals (Diamond et al., 1992;
Peng et al., 2005). However, this topic has been directly investigated
in patients with lupus, and no correlation was found between levels
of anti-PC antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies. In fact, levels
of IgG anti-PC antibodies in these patients did not correlate with
any clinical disease manifestations, or with changes in other sero￾logic markers such as C3, C4, that were measured (Gronwall et al.,
2012).
Natural antibodies to apoptotic cells may also be relevant to
the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases. Many inflamma￾tory conditions, such as atherosclerosis and chronic pulmonary
disease, are associated with chronically increased levels of apop￾totic cells, either due to increased production or impaired apop￾totic clearance. We would argue that in these settings higher
levels of IgM anti-apoptotic cell antibodies, through enhancing
apoptotic clearance and the dampening of inflammation, may
also provide benefits. We have found that higher levels of IgM
anti-PC correlate with protection from cardiovascular events in
patients with lupus (Gronwall et al., 2012), which was consistent
with findings in a smaller study (Su et al., 2008). Furthermore,
Frostegård and co-workers have also shown that low levels of IgM
anti-PC antibodies in patients with lupus correlate with occur￾rence of detectable atherosclerotic plaques by carotid ultrasound
(Anania et al., 2010). Low levels of IgM anti-PC have also been
associated with increased occurrence of stroke (Fiskesund et al.,
2010), heart attack (Gronlund et al., 2009), and symptomatic ath￾erosclerotic cardiovascular disease in men over 60 years of age
(de Faire and Frostegard, 2009), as well as Alzheimer’s disease
(Eriksson et al., 2010). Higher levels of IgM and IgG binding

to oxidized LDL, a complex macromolecule that expresses the
PC epitope, have been found to correlate with a lower burden
of atherosclerosis, as measured by carotid artery intima-media
thickness by ultrasound (Fukumoto et al., 2000; Karvonen et al.,
2003).
Higher levels of IgM antiphospholipid antibodies that bind to
beta-2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI) and cardiolipin in lupus patients
correlated with lessfrequent renal disease manifestations (Mehrani
and Petri, 2011; Gronwall et al., 2012). Similarly, although IgG￾antibodies to dsDNA are the hallmark of lupus and are often
associated with lupus nephritis, higher levels of IgM anti-dsDNA,
and a lower ratio of IgG to IgM anti-dsDNA are instead neg￾atively associated with the occurrence of glomerulonephritis in
SLE patients (Witte et al., 1998; Forger et al., 2004; Witte, 2008;
Gronwall et al., 2012; see Table 1). It may therefore be rele￾vant that anti-dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, and anti-β2-GPI anti￾bodies have been shown to bind apoptotic cells (Rovere et al.,
1998; Sorice et al., 2000; Cocca et al., 2001; Wellmann et al.,
2005). Microarray studies of SLE patients have also shown that
the presence in a lupus patient of a diverse autoreactive IgM
profile, which was interpreted as representing higher levels of
cross-reactive IgM antibodies, was correlated with less active
lupus disease (Li et al., 2005). The cellular origins and regu￾lation of IgM with these specificities, and their relationship to
B-1 cells that produce anti-PC natural antibodies merit further
investigation.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
It has become clear that natural IgM can play crucial roles in the
immune system and recent studies have highlighted the impor￾tance of IgM as immunomodulatory and protective factor in
inflammatory and autoimmune disease. While the binding speci￾ficities and constant region-associated effector functions of some
IgG autoreactive antibodies convey pathogenic properties, there
are also specific IgM self-reactive antibodies that may instead have
beneficial effects, protecting from uncontrolled inflammation, and
contributing to the maintenance of the immunological balance.
The efficient disposal of dead cells is one of the most primitive and
pivotal functions of the immune system. Recurrent natural anti￾body IgM clones have therefore developed specialized functions,
with a higher frequency of antibodies with binding specificity for
dead, dying, and senescent cells, which may have been selected
during the evolution of the adaptive immune system. The high
potential valency of antigen-binding of polymeric IgM and an
associated superior ability to interact with the early complement
recognition factors,MBL and C1q, as well the absence of the capac￾ity for activating FcγR triggering, can provide natural IgM with
unique properties for enhancing the interactions between apop￾totic cell and phagocyte. Although the postulated role of natural
IgM in the development of a cellular synapse between apoptotic
cells and phagocytes is still speculative, there is evidence that these
autoantibodies may mediate specific anti-inflammatory signaling
pathways.
Based on recent findings regarding the potential roles of nat￾ural antibodies, there may be prognostic and diagnostic value in
the monitoring of levels of natural IgM to specific apoptosis￾associated antigens to better predict clinical manifestations and
for evaluating response to therapeutic interventions. In the light
of the above described observations, it is appealing to envision
future therapeutic strategies based on harnessing the properties of
natural antibodies. As natural IgM may act to influence pathogen￾esis through suppression of inflammatory responses from innate
immune cells, this therapeutic approach would be hypothesized
to be effective in a range of diseases. In fact, therapeutic intra￾venous immunoglobulin treatments are already in development
that take advantage of the properties of natural IgM (Bayry et al.,
2011), although a monoclonal strategy could provide a safer and
more effective approach. Finally, advances in our understand￾ing of the roles of natural antibodies may have implications for
B-cell targeted therapies as these biopharmaceuticals may also
deplete B-1 cells and reduce the expression of protective natural
antibodies.
