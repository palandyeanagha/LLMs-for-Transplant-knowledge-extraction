Summary
A total of 164 patients from Australia, Ceylon, India,
Singapore, and Thailand were studied for the prevalence
of autoantibodies associated with "idiopathic" chronic
liver disease-namely, antinuclear antibody, smooth
muscle antibody, and mitochondrial antibody. The
prevalence of these autoantibodies was high among
patients from Australia (55%), but was low among
patients from Ceylon (14%,), India (11%), Singapore (0%),
and Thailand (8%). There are variations in types of hepa￾titis and cirrhosis between races, and this applies par￾ticularly to the type associated with autoimmune
markers. This may be related to genetic differences that
have evolved between peoples of European and Asian
descent.
Introduction
The lupoid type of active chronic hepatitis with immune
aberrations has been the subject of many reports from Australia
(Mackay et al., 1965; Mistilis et al., 1968; Mackay, 1972),
Europe (Krook, 1961; Harders and Dolle, 1963; Read et al.,
1963; Vischer, 1971), and North America (Beam et al., 1956;
Reynolds et al., 1964; Maclachian et al., 1965; Popper et al.,
1965), but few from South-east Asia (Fung et al., 1972). If this
type of chronic hepatitis is in fact rare in South-east Asian
countries there should be a low prevalence of those autoanti￾bodies associated with chronic hepatitis among patients with
jaundice or cirrhosis or both diseases from such countries. This
report describes a serological study of patients with chronic
liver disease from Australia, Ceylon, India, Singapore, and
Thailand.

Design of Study
Sera from patients with long-standing jaundice or cirrhosis or
both diseases from Australia, Ceylon, India, Singapore, and
Thailand were coded and referred for serological tests which
were done in Melbourne. Patients with liver disease due to
extrahepatic obstruction, cancer, parasitism, heredofamilial
disorders, or alcoholism were excluded. Histological assessment
of liver biopsy specimens was made locally. The criteria for case
selection were chronic jaundice attributable to chronic hepatitis
or cirrhosis or, if jaundice was not present, clear evidence of
established cirrhosis of the "cryptogenic" type.
Patients and Methods
The Australian (Caucasian) cases were randomly selected on a
prospective basis. They were drawn from a survey over one
year of patients in the Royal Melbourne Hospital considered to
require a biopsy for diagnostic purposes (Bhathal et al., 1973).
Included in this survey were 205 patients, 18 of whom had
non-alcoholic cirrhosis, seven had cryptogenic cirrhosis, eight
had cirrhosis associated with active chronic hepatitis, one had
primary biliary cirrhosis, and two had haemochromatosis (see
table). This particular method of selection yielded relatively few
cases, but was used to avoid bias.
The Ceylonese cases were drawn frrmn the practice of a
consultant physician. The 14 patients included nine with
cryptogenic cirrhosis, three with active chronic hepatitis, and
two with biliary cirrhosis.
The Indian cases were selected randomly from patients
attending the department of medicine of the Maulana Azad
Medical College and Associated Irwin and G. B. Pant Hospitals,
New Delhi, according to the criterion of prolonged jaundice
lasting for at least six months. The 54 patients included 10 with
cryptogenic cirrhosis, two with active chronic hepatitis, and 42
with chronic hepatitis of unspecified type.
The Singaporean cases were selected randomly from patients
attending the General Hospital, Singapore, on the basis of a
diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. The 40 patients included 37
Chinese, two Indians, and one Malay.
The Thai cases were selected randomly from patients attend￾ing the Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, according to the criterion of
prolonged jaundice. The 38 patients included 20 with crypto￾genic cirrhosis, three with active chronic hepatitis, three with
biliary cirrhosis, and 12 with chronic hepatitis of unspecified
type.
Serological Tests.-Serum from each of the 164 patients was
tested for autoantibodies (Whittingham and Mackay, 1969) by
immunofluorescence. Tests were made for antinuclear anti￾bodies by using polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes
from human blood; smooth muscle antibodies by using rat
stomach; mitochondrial antibodies by using mouse kidney;
and gastric parietal cell and thyroid epithelial cell antibodies by
using human stomach and human thyroid gland. Sera containing
antinuclear antibodies were titrated in tenfold dilutions and the
results expressed in units per ml (Whittingham, 1972), and
sera containing other autoantibodies were titrated in doubling
dilutions, the results being expressed as the reciprocal of the
dilution. The diluent used was phosphate-buffered saline pH 7*3

containing 0O05% bovine serum albumin. The sera were tested
for hepatitis B antigen (HBAg) by cross-over immunoelectro￾phoresis (Gust and Kaldor, 1971), and for the level of gamma￾globulin by a zinc sulphate turbidity reaction (Weiden, 1953).
x2 tests were used for statistical analyses.
Results
The prevalence of the autoantibodies, hepatitis B antigen, and
level of gammaglobulin in the 164 patients studied is set out in
the table. Noteworthy is the high prevalence of autoantibodies
associated with chronic "idiopathic" liver disease among
Australians (55%) compared with those from the Asian countries
(0-14%). The levels of these autoantibodies were also high
among Australians in that antinuclear antibodies ranged up to
167 units/ml and smooth muscle antibodies up to a titre of 512;
the maximum level of antinuclear antibodies among the Asian
patients was 167 units/ml and the highest titre of smooth muscle
antibodies was 128. In none of the groups was there a high
prevalence of HBAg.
Discussion
Our study appears to be the first recorded attempt to examine the
prevalence of chronic liver disease with autoimmune features
among various racial groups. International surveys of this nature
are beset with difficulties because of differences from country to
country in nomenclature, definition, and classification of chronic
liver disease. None the less, we believe that the criteria applied
to the selection of the 164 cases of liver disease in this study gave
us valid groups for comparison. The high prevalence of auto￾antibodies to nuclei, smooth muscle, and mitochondria known to
be associated with chronic liver disease in Australian Caucasians
was in contrast to the lower prevalence detected among Indians,
Ceylonese, Thais, and Singaporean Chinese with chronic liver
disease. Studies from Uganda (Doniach, 1972), Singapore
(Fung et al., 1972), and Hong Kong (Lee, 1973) have likewise
shown a low prevalence of autoantibodies among non-Caucasians
with chronic liver disease. Thus the autoimmune (lupoid) type
of chronic hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis may vary in
prevalence among races; the same has been said of the auto￾immune type of gastritis, the precursor of pernicious anaemia
(Irvine et al., 1969).
The main explanations for differences in prevalence and type
of liver diseases among racial groups would include differing
exposure or susceptibility to infectious agents or toxic agents,
nutritional differences, and inter-racial genetic differences. In
Australia transmissible agents, particularly hepatitis B virus,
have not been recognized as important causes of hepatitis
(Mathews and Mackay, 1970; Cooksley et al., 1972). The
incidence of HBAg was also low among the South-east Asian
sera and this was not due to selection of patients. We note that
higher prevalences of HBAg in chronic liver disease have been
reported from Austria, Greece, and Uganda (Wells and Fuden￾berg, 1972), Kenya (Bagshawe et al., 1971), Italy (Bianchi et al.,
1972), and Hong Kong (Lee, 1973). The possible role of toxic
and nutritional factors in chronic hepatitis is still undefined,
particularly in Asian communities. Familial aggregations of
active chronic hepatitis and immune disorders have been only
occasionally reported (Joske and Laurence, 1970; Whittingham
et al., 1970; Hilberg et al., 1971), but among Australian patients
with autoimmune active chronic hepatitis there is a high fre￾quency of two histocompatibility antigens HL-A1 and HL-A8
(Mackay and Morris, 1972). It may be relevant that the pre￾valence of the haplotype HL-Al,8 among Australian Caucasians
is high (9%) compared with the prevalence of this haplotype
among Indians (0 9%) and Chinese (0 06%) (Ting, 1972).
Thus genetic differences expressed through histocompatibility
antigens could be a factor accounting for differences in racial
prevalence of disease in general, and for the autoimmune type of
active chronic hepatitis in particular.
Future studies of relevance would be firstly, the serological
analyses of chronic liver disease in Asians residing in Australia
and of Australians residing in Asia, provided the numbers were
sufficient; and secondly, the analysis of histocompatibility anti￾gens in Asians with chronic liver disease.

Summary
The measurement of bone loss in patients undergoing
maintenance dialysis over a period of two and a half
years is reported. The tendency to lose bone is a likely
event in renal failure, but depends more on the individual
patient than on the type of dialysis used, provided that
steps are taken to prevent avoidable calcium loss during
dialysis. Vitamin D therapy was an important factor in
preventing bone loss in some cases. The tendency to lose
bone more readily when both kidneys were absent may
have reflected a deficiency of 1-25 dihydrocholecalciferol.
On the other hand, bone loss was also observed in trans￾planted patients. The need to measure bone loss at regular
intervals once renal failure has been diagnosed is
stressed.

failure. Absorption of dietary calcium is reduced as a result of

abnormal vitamin D metabolism (Genuth et al., 1969), and
increased parathyroid activity commonly leads to excessive bone
resorption (Kleeman et al., 1970). Thus, both osteomalacic and
fibrocystic bone changes are found. Such disturbed calcium
metabolism almost invariably leads to an increased rate of bone
resorption which is often associated with the deposition of
calcium salts in soft tissues. The difficulty of assessing metabolic
balance studies under these circumstances is formidable, but a
better understanding about the state of the bone mineral in
chronic renal failure can be achieved by measuring the loss of
bone.
A previous paper reported a scanning technique which
uses the 60 keV emission from the isotope 24l1Am to
measure the bone mineral in the femoral shaft of patients on
maintenance dialysis (Atkinson et al., 1970). Measurements
made at monthly intervals over 40 weeks showed that 13 patients
had a tendency to lose bone mineral. The present paper reports
changes in the bone mineral in 15 patients during a much longer
period (two and a half years) which includes the time covered by
the initial report.
Method
Measurements of bone mineral have been made on a control
group of subjects and on 15 patients receiving maintenance
dialysis for chronic renal failure. At the beginning of this study
six patients were being treated by peritoneal dialysis and seven
by haemodialysis. This therapy was maintained during the first
40 weeks (table I). After two and a half years two remained on
peritoneal dialysis; six, together with two new patients, were on
haemodialysis; and two had received transplants (three had
discontinued bone measurements). Only in the two transplanted
patients was there any significant renal excretion; of the dialysed
