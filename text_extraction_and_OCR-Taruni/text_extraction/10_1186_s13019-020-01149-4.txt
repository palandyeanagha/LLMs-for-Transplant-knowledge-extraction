Abstract
Background: The Swan-Ganz catheter plays an important role in gaining understanding of cardiac pathophysiology
and in the hemodynamic monitoring of critically ill patients. Difficult removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter is a rare
but serious complication.
Case presentation: This case presents the difficult removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter in a 28-year-old female patient
after cardiac surgery. Fluoroscopy and chest X-ray revealed that a portion of the Swan-Ganz catheter was coiled on
the central venous catheter at the level of the superior vena cava. Under X-ray guidance, the central venous
catheter was first removed, and then the Swan-Ganz catheter was successfully withdrawn through the percutaneous
introducer sheath.
Conclusions: This case report provides an unreported reason for difficult removal and describes a successful solution.
This report suggests that X-ray examinations may be necessary before removing the Swan-Ganz catheter.
Keywords: Swan-Ganz catheter, Complication, Difficult removal
Background
Difficult removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been
reported with an estimated incidence of 0.2–2.5% [1],
due to reasons including intracardiac knots and kinks in
the Swan-Ganz catheter [2–6]. Cardiac perforation and
pulmonary artery rupture were the most severe compli￾cations due to the difficult removal of a catheter in a
previous report [7, 8]. This case report features the diffi￾cult removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter, which coiled on
the central venous catheter in a patient after cardiac
surgery.
Case presentation
A 28-year-old woman, weight 55 kg and height 162 cm, ini￾tially presented to the emergency department of an outside
hospital with a 2-month history of chest distress, cough and
dyspnea. The patient’s symptoms did not improve
significantly after oxygen therapy or anti-asthma medication
combined with aerosol inhalation. The patient was later
transferred to the cardiovascular surgery department in the
authors’ institution with aggravation of the above symptoms.
Echocardiography revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation and
congenital heart disease, including a ventricular septal defect
and rupture of the right coronary sinus aneurysm. An
abdominal computed tomography scan revealed that the in￾ferior vena cava and hepatic veins were widened. The pre￾operative laboratory examination was unremarkable. For
invasive hemodynamic measurement, a Swan-Ganz catheter
(Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was inserted through an
8-F percutaneous introducer sheath placed in the right in￾ternal jugular vein, and a central venous catheter was
inserted into the right subclavian vein without any difficul￾ties. The pulmonary artery pressure waveform suggested that
the catheter was successfully floated into the pulmonary ar￾tery. The patient underwent ventricular septal defect repair,
aortoplasty and tricuspid valvuloplasty under cardiopulmo￾nary bypass.

After obtaining the hemodynamic indexes postopera￾tively, the Swan-Ganz catheter was found difficult to
withdraw when it was pulled out to 35 cm mark. The
cardiovascular surgeons and intensive care physicians
suggested transporting the patient to interventional radi￾ology. The chest X-ray showed that a portion of the
Swan-Ganz catheter coiled on the central venous cathe￾ters at the level of the superior vena cava and formed a
knot approximately 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 1). Under X￾ray guidance, the interventional radiologist first removed
the central venous catheter smoothly. Then, the Swan￾Ganz catheter was gently pushed into the right ventricle
to provide more space to uncoil, and then the catheter
returned to its original coiled configuration. Finally, the
Swan-Ganz catheter was successfully withdrawn through
the percutaneous introducer sheath. A closer inspection
of the Swan-Ganz catheter coiled on the central venous
catheter is shown in Fig. 2. During this procedure, the

patient’s hemodynamics were not significantly affected,
and the patient did not present any complications or
cardiovascular injury. Valvar damage was excluded by
echocardiography.
Discussion and conclusion
The use of a Swan-Ganz catheter with balloon flotation
is a feasible and rapid technique for hemodynamic mon￾itoring in critically ill patients [9]. However, there have
been continuous reports of complications related to the
removal of Swan-Ganz catheter in clinical practice, and
the common causes include intracardiac knots and kinks
in the catheter (Table 1). In this case report, fluoroscopy
and chest X-ray revealed that a portion of the catheter
coiled on the central venous catheter and formed a knot.
The cause of the knot is unknown, and the authors
hypothesize that the catheter end may form a knot when
the cardiothoracic surgeon reinserted the Swan-Ganz
catheter into the distal portion of the pulmonary artery
after performing tricuspid valve surgery under cardiopul￾monary bypass. Therefore, the loop of the catheter may
easily coil around the central venous catheter when the
Swan-Ganz catheter is withdrawn. This case suggested
that although pulmonary artery pressure wave may re￾flect the Swan-Ganz catheter successfully floated into
the pulmonary artery, it could not indicate whether the
catheter formed the intracardiac knot and kink.
In this case report, the authors describe a successful
management approach for removing a Swan-Ganz cath￾eter. The key point for addressing loops and knots is to
withdraw the central venous catheter with the assistance
of radiologic techniques. Then, the Swan-Ganz catheter
could be advanced into the right ventricle to provide
more space for the catheter to uncoil. Finally, the cath￾eter was withdrawn under X-ray guidance. This case re￾port suggested that the surgeons should place the
catheter in a normal coiled state before re-advancing the
Swan-Ganz catheter intraoperatively to avoid forming
knots and then gently place the catheter in the right ven￾tricle. Additionally, it is important to take a chest X-ray
before removing the Swan-Ganz catheter in patients
undergoing tricuspid valve surgery. This process may
help similar difficult removals of Swan-Ganz catheters,
thereby eliminating the need for invasive maneuvers, but
cannot be applied for tight knots.

Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, the interventional radiologist uncoiled the catheter by applying slow sustained
traction on both the Cordis and Swan-Ganz catheters. Once the coil of the Swan-Ganz catheter approached the end
of the Cordis catheter, both catheters were removed successfully simultaneously causing the coil to unwrap.
