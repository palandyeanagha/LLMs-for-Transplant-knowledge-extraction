Imaging Update: Acute Colonic Diverticulitis
Kristen K. DeStigter, M.D.1 and David P. Keating, M.D.1
ABSTRACT
Because the incidence of colonic diverticulosis is high in the general population,
incidental asymptomatic diverticulosis is commonly seen on radiology imaging studies.
However, diagnostic imaging performed specifically for diverticular disease is essentially
limited to imaging of suspected acute colonic diverticulitis (ACD) and its complications.
The clinical diagnosis of ACD can be challenging, and imaging has become an essential
tool to aid in diagnosis, assess severity of disease, and aid in treatment planning. Computed
tomography (CT) has replaced contrast enema as the imaging procedure of choice for
diverticulitis. Ultrasound has also been successfully used for diagnosis, and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has significant potential as a radiation-free imaging test for acute
colonic diverticulitis.
KEYWORDS: Acute colonic diverticulitis, diagnostic imaging, contrast enema,
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound
Objectives: On completion of this article the reader should be able to describe the imaging modalities used to diagnose colonic
diverticular disease and summarize the common imaging findings of acute colonic diverticulitis for each modality.
PLAIN FILM RADIOGRAPHY
Plain film radiography is usually of little value in the
assessment of suspected diverticulitis unless there is free
intraperitoneal air from perforation, portal venous gas, or
signs of bowel ileus or obstruction. However, these
findings are nonspecific. Plain film radiography may
fail to demonstrate the small contained perforations
commonly encountered on computed tomography
(CT) scans of patients with acute colonic diverticulitis,
and is not sensitive for other complications such as
abscess and fistula.
CONTRAST ENEMA
Until the 1980s when it was replaced by CT, contrast
enema was the primary imaging modality for colonic
diverticulitis. Today, barium enema is not performed in
the acute setting due to the risk of perforation and
peritonitis, even though several studies have shown it
is safe if there are no clinical signs of perforation. Barium
also causes artifacts that may preclude diagnosis if a CT
scan is necessary. Water-soluble contrast enema (CE)
can be safely performed with low morbidity and low cost,
is widely available, and easy to perform, but is not as
sensitive as CT (80 to 92% for CE vs up to 99% for
CT).1,2 In the appropriate clinical setting, CE findings
of fold thickening, segmental spasm, sinus tract, fistula,
mass effect from abscess and extraluminal free or con￾tained contrast may be demonstrated and can be diag￾nostic of acute diverticulitis. Contrast enemas are most
useful in the setting of chronic diverticulitis,3 for follow￾up in problem cases when diverticulitis is suspected but

not seen on CT, or for assisting to differentiate diver￾ticulitis from colon carcinoma. Delayed follow-up after
acute symptoms have subsided should show preservation
of the colonic mucosa to confirm diverticulitis. Involve￾ment of longer segments of colon is also more typical of
diverticulitis than malignancy.4 CE is a more time￾consuming and involved exam for the patient when
compared with other imaging modalities like CT, and
generally it is not a good test to identify alternative
diagnoses.
COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY
The advent of CT has revolutionized the diagnosis and
management of patients with diverticulitis. Multidetec￾tor CT is now considered the gold standard for assessing
this disease. The preferred examination for evaluation of
acute left lower quadrant pain and suspected divertic￾ulitis is CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral, rectal,
and intravenous (IV) contrast. Acquisition of thin (1 mm
or less) axial source images allows generation of high￾quality reconstructed 3 mm axial and coronal images.
Oral contrast is generally used, but often does not reach
the sigmoid colon by the time imaging is performed.
Rectal contrast may not be necessary for the evaluation
of diverticulitis, but can improve colonic distention,
opacify fistula tracts and increase the accuracy of the
examination.5 Unless there are contraindications, intra￾venous (IV) contrast is routinely administered to assist
with identification of abscesses and to demonstrate
enhancement of the colonic wall. IV contrast is also
useful in the diagnosis of alternative disease entities that
mimic diverticulitis.6
Sigmoid diverticulitis is the most common cause
of left lower quadrant pain in adults, and when imaging
is required, CT is the most appropriate diagnostic
imaging tool to confirm suspected left colonic divertic￾ulitis. The American College of Radiology rates CT of
the abdomen and pelvis with oral and/or colonic con￾trast as the preferred procedure in the setting of left
lower quadrant pain with or without fever, except in
women of childbearing age when ultrasound (US) is the
initial preferred modality for unexplained left lower
quadrant pain.7 When a patient has known divertic￾ulosis and signs of uncomplicated diverticulitis, some
physicians elect to treat the patient without imaging
confirmation.
When imaging is necessary, CT is the test of
choice because of its high sensitivity and specificity,
reproducibility, availability, and it is less invasive when
compared with CE. It can be performed in acutely ill
patients. CT serves the following functions in the
setting of left lower quadrant pain: (1) confirms the
diagnosis of diverticulitis, (2) evaluates the severity and
extent of disease, (3) allows for treatment planning of
complications such as abscess, and (4) demonstrates
other causes of abdominal pain that may mimic diver￾ticulitis.
The reported sensitivity for diverticulitis on CT is
79 to 99%.8–10 In the literature, higher sensitivity and
specificity has been reported more recently, commensu￾rate with the advancement of CT technology, with most
institutions now using multidetector CT scanning with
better resolution and the ability to generate high-quality
sagittal and coronal images.11 The two most common
CT findings in uncomplicated diverticulitis are colonic
wall thickening (wall thickness is greater than 3 mm on
the short axis of the lumen) and pericolic fat stranding
(Fig. 1).12,13 Often, these signs are associated with an
identifiable inflamed diverticulum. Wall thickening asso￾ciated with muscular hypertrophy from diverticulosis

may be difficult to distinguish from that associated with
diverticulitis when pericolonic inflammatory changes are
absent (Fig. 2).2 The degree of fat stranding may vary
from minimal ‘‘dirty fat’’ (Fig. 3) to severe inflammation
and phlegmonous change. CT may fail to demonstrate
early, mild cases of diverticulitis. Coronal reformatted
images may be helpful to show mild pericolonic fat
stranding associated with horizontally oriented segments
of colon (Fig. 3B). The CT findings in complicated
diverticulitis may include the presence of an abscess
(defined as a fluid-containing mass with or without
air and an enhancing wall), and contained or free extra￾luminal air bubbles or pockets (Fig. 4). Other complica￾tions such as bowel obstruction, hepatic abscess (Fig. 5),
fistula and inferior mesenteric vein thrombosis can often
be demonstrated with CT. Fistulas frequently commu￾nicate with an abscess or other hollow viscus,
and colovesicular fistulas are the most common (Fig. 6).
Fistula tracts can often be directly visualized if rectal
contrast is administered.
CT findings may be used to direct clinical
management. Some authors have associated CT find￾ings with the Hinchey classification and modified
Hinchey classification (adapted from Wasvary et al),
showing how CT can effectively guide medical or
surgical treatment.1,14–18
When abscesses are identified, CT-guided percu￾taneous drainage can preclude the need for surgery
(Fig. 7) and can limit the need for multistage surgical

procedures (Fig. 8).14,19,20 The size of diverticular ab￾scesses is important in directing treatment based on
expected outcomes.21,22 Patients with abscesses <3 cm
can be treated with conservative management alone, and
those with abscesses >3 cm benefit from percutaneous
drainage with referral for surgical follow-up. Prior to
catheter removal, a tube injection with iodinated con￾trast performed under fluoroscopy is recommended to
exclude communication with the colon. Even in cases
where communication to the colon is documented,
continued percutaneous drainage can result in resolution
of the fistula without surgical intervention (Fig. 7D).
Abscess should be distinguished from cavities with broad
communication to the colon (auto draining) and giant
colonic diverticulum.
Although seen more often in the younger age
group, right colonic diverticulitis is uncommon, with the
cecum involved in only 5% of patients. The preoperative
diagnosis is challenging because there are no clinical
signs and symptoms that are truly specific. The clinical
presentation can mimic cholecystitis or appendicitis. CT
findings in right colonic diverticulitis are similar to other
areas of the colon (Fig. 9), with colon wall thickening
and pericolonic fat stranding seen in all patients on one
prospective study.23 Other individual findings included
submucosal thickening in 60%, diverticula in 60%, an
inflamed diverticulum in 30%, pericolonic phlegmon in
40%, ileocolic lymphadenopathy in 90%, and visualiza￾tion of a normal appendix in 60%. Right colonic diver￾ticulitis can be difficult to distinguish from colon
carcinoma, especially if the inflamed diverticulum is
not well visualized on CT. After supportive manage￾ment, colonoscopy or contrast enema is recommended to
confirm the diagnosis.
CT is helpful in identifying and/or excluding
other causes of abdominal pain when diverticulitis is
not the etiology. Differential diagnosis includes neo￾plasm, appendicitis, epiploic appendagitis, ischemic col￾itis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Primary colon
carcinoma is the main consideration in the differential
for findings of diverticulitis on CT (Fig. 10) because it
may present with eccentric or circumferential wall thick￾ening, varying degrees of inflammation, and signs of
obstruction.4,24–26 Perforated colon carcinoma may
mimic diverticulitis. In general, fluid at the root of the
mesentery and engorgement of regional vasculature
suggests an inflammatory process, and pericolonic fat
stranding is more typical of diverticulitis or other in￾flammation than of colon carcinoma. Colonic wall
thickening is usually greater (measuring >2 cm) with
neoplasm and is more often eccentric. Diverticulitis and
neoplasm may both involve short segments of bowel;
however, when a segment of >10 cm is involved, this is
considered specific for diverticulitis. Left-sided perico￾lonic lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes measuring 1 cm or
more in the short axis) are usually more specific for colon
carcinoma, but are not uncommon with right colonic
diverticulitis. The presence of diverticula in an involved
segment suggests diverticulitis, but the high prevalence
of diverticulosis in the general population dictates that
the presence of diverticula cannot be used as a mitigating
factor to exclude neoplasm. When the findings are
equivocal for diverticulitis versus colon carcinoma,
follow-up colonoscopy or imaging is suggested.
Appendicitis is the main differential concern for
right-sided diverticulitis, and is the most common cause
of nongenitourinary right lower quadrant pain. Small
bowel pathology can also mimic diverticulitis, and CT is
helpful to distinguish these patients. Epiploic appenda￾gitis is a nonsurgical entity that results from torsion and
venous occlusion of an epiploic appendage, and patients

present with signs and symptoms that mimic divertic￾ulitis. A CT scan in these patients reveals an ovoid fat
attenuation mass with surrounding inflammation on the
antimesenteric side, usually in the absence of colonic wall
thickening (Fig. 11).
ULTRASOUND
Transabdominal sonography is an alternative technique
for evaluating patients with suspected diverticulitis, but
is not as widely used as a first imaging test in the United
States. Those who advocate the use of US stress its lower
cost and wider availability over other imaging modalities.
It is considered safer for patients because it lacks radi￾ation exposure and there is no need for IV contract
administration. However, US is operator dependent, is
not as accurate as CT for identifying alternative diagno￾ses, and is not as useful for surgical planning when
intervention is required. In a meta-analysis of the test
accuracy of ultrasound, Lame´ris et al found that there
were no significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy
of US versus CT in diagnosing acute colonic divertic￾ulitis.27 Graded compression US is used to reduce
inconclusive findings from overlying bowel loops, and
has been shown to have a sensitivity of 77 to 98% and a
specificity of 80 to 99%.28,29 US can accurately measure
bowel wall thickness, demonstrate pericolonic fat in￾flammation, and identify abscess.30,31 Although US can
detect some complications of diverticulitis and occasion￾ally demonstrate alternative diagnoses, it is not as sensi￾tive as CT for these indications.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can effectively
diagnose acute diverticulitis, with reported sensitivity

of 86 to 94% and specificity of 88 to 92%.32,33 It is likely
that continually improving MRI techniques may result
in higher sensitivity and specificity in the future.
Buckley et al described MRI findings in patients with
acute colonic diverticulitis, identifying findings similar
to CT: bowel wall thickening, pericolic stranding,
presence of diverticula, and complications (Fig. 12).34
MRI is also comparable with CT in its ability to
identify alternative diagnoses. Similar to ultrasound,
MRI has the benefit of no radiation exposure, but

because it is operator independent, it may be more
applicable as the test of choice as the medical commun￾ity becomes more aware of the risks of radiation
exposure and seeks alternative imaging modalities to
CT. The inability to percutaneously drain abscesses
using MRI has been described as a limitation of this
modality. Certainly, MRI-guided procedures have be￾come the mainstay for other organ systems (breast,
brain) and should be easily extrapolated to the abdomen
in the near future.
CONCLUSION
The role of imaging evaluation in acute colonic diver￾ticulitis is to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate the severity
and extent of disease, exclude alternative diagnoses, and
allow for treatment planning. CT is currently considered
the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of patients
with suspected acute diverticulitis. Although CT has
high accuracy and sensitivity/specificity, it is scrutinized
because of the risk of ionizing radiation to patients.35
Because the recurrence rate of diverticulitis is high, it is
not uncommon for patients in U.S. hospitals to undergo
many CT scans with lifetime cumulative radiation doses

of 100 mSv or higher.36,37 As patient safety concerns
related to radiation exposure continue to gain a higher
profile, there will likely be a shift to using radiation-free
imaging modalities to evaluate acute abdominal pathol￾ogy, especially in the younger population. US is accurate,
inexpensive and widely available, but is operator depend￾ent and unlikely to gain momentum as a frontline
imaging modality for colonic diverticulitis in the United
States. As techniques improve, MRI may supplant CT as
the test of choice for ACD because it is accurate,
operator independent, and lacks ionizing radiation.
Some authors are already recommending the use of
MRI (over CT) in patients younger than 60 years.32
Randomized prospective trials looking at all three
modalities (CT, US, MRI) will be helpful to guide
the appropriate utilization of imaging for evaluating
acute colonic diverticulitis.
