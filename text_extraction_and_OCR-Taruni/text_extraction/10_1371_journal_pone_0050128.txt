Abstract
Background: It has been reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c and their synthetic ligands have
direct effects on pancreatic b-cells. We investigated whether PPAR-c activation stimulates insulin secretion through the up￾regulation of GPR40 in pancreatic b-cells.
Methods: Rat insulinoma INS-1 cells and primary rat islets were treated with rosiglitazone (RGZ) and/or adenoviral PPAR-c
overexpression. OLETF rats were treated with RGZ.
Results: PPAR-c activation with RGZ and/or adenoviral PPAR-c overexpression increased free fatty acid (FFA) receptor GPR40
expression, and increased insulin secretion and intracellular calcium mobilization, and was blocked by the PLC inhibitors,
GPR40 RNA interference, and GLUT2 RNA interference. As a downstream signaling pathway of intracellular calcium
mobilization, the phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and CREB, and the downstream IRS-2 and phospho-Akt were significantly
increased. Despite of insulin receptor RNA interference, the levels of IRS-2 and phospho-Akt was still maintained with PPAR￾c activation. In addition, the b-cell specific gene expression, including Pdx-1 and FoxA2, increased in a GPR40- and GLUT2-
dependent manner. The levels of GPR40, phosphorylated CaMKII and CREB, and b-cell specific genes induced by RGZ were
blocked by GW9662, a PPAR-c antagonist. Finally, PPAR-c activation up-regulated b-cell gene expressions through FoxO1
nuclear exclusion, independent of the insulin signaling pathway. Based on immunohistochemical staining, the GLUT2, IRS-2,
Pdx-1, and GPR40 were more strongly expressed in islets from RGZ-treated OLETF rats compared to control islets.
Conclusion: These observations suggest that PPAR-c activation with RGZ and/or adenoviral overexpression increased
intracellular calcium mobilization, insulin secretion, and b-cell gene expression through GPR40 and GLUT2 gene up￾regulation.

Introduction
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c is a
member of the nuclear receptor family that plays a crucial role
in lipid and glucose homeostasis. It is well known that
thiazolidinediones (TZDs), synthetic ligands for PPAR-c, exert
their glucose-lowering effects principally via improving peripheral
insulin sensitivity [1,2]. However, some studies indicate that TZDs
have direct effects on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)
and pancreatic b-cell gene expression [3–10]. Furthermore, it has
been reported that TZDs protect b-cells from the pro-inflamma￾tory cytokines such as interleukin-1b and interferon-c [11,12],
human islet amyloid polypeptide (h-IAPP) [13,14], free fatty acid
(FFA) toxicity [15–18], and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
[19].
G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptor 40 (GPR 40) is a
membrane-bound FFA receptor mainly expressed in the brain and
pancreatic b-cells [20–22]. Accumulating evidence indicates that
GPR40 mediates the majority of both acute and chronic effects of
FFAs on insulin secretion, including the amplification of GSIS
[21,23–29], and the receptor has been suggested to be involved in
the control of cell proliferation via extracellular signal-related
kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and PKB

signaling pathways [30]. GPR40 is also expressed in enteroendo￾crine cells, including cells expressing incretin hormones, glucagon
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotrophic
peptide (GIP), and it modulates FFA-stimulated insulin secretion
not only from pancreatic b-cells, but also through the regulation of
incretin hormones [31].
Recently, it was reported that TZDs may preferentially activate
the GPR40 receptor, resulting in Ca2+ mobilization from
thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores that would induce cell
growth, whereas the endogenous PPAR-c ligand, 15-deoxy-D12,14-
prostaglandin J2 (15 d-PGJ2), did not induce any Ca2+ signal and
inhibited cell growth in nonmalignant human bronchial epithelial
cells [22,32]. Taken together, TZDs increase intracellular Ca2+
from the ER through GPR40 receptor activation in a PPAR-c￾independent manner.
In this context, we investigated whether PPAR-c activation
stimulates insulin secretion through the up-regulation of GPR40 in
INS-1 cells. We also explored the GPR40 downstream signaling
pathways involved in the role of PPAR-c activation in pancreatic
b-cells.
Methods
Materials
Rosiglitazone (RGZ) was obtained from Alexis (Leusen,
Switzerland). The U-73122 and nifedipine were purchased from
Calbiochem (Merk, Nottingham, UK). All other reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless noted.
Cell culture
Rat insulinoma INS-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. P.
Maechler (Geneva, Switzerland) [33]. INS-1 cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mM glucose supplemented
with 10 mM HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 mM b￾mercaptoethanol, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of strep￾tomycin in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). In the
starvation condition, RPMI-1640 media containing 2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) was used.
Islet isolation
Islets were isolated from the pancreas of male Sprague Dawley
rats (Orientbio, Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) by distending
the pancreatic duct with a mixture of collagenase (Roche). After
the digestion at 37uC, the islets were separated on a discontinuous
histopaque density gradient (Histopaque 1077; Sigma) and further
purified by handpicking. Handpicked islets were cultured in
sponge (SpongostanH; Johnson & Johnson, Denmark) with RPMI
1640 medium. All the procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Samsung
Biomedical Research Institute.
Ca2+ detection assay
After treatment with RGZ and/or other chemicals for 24 h,
cells were stimulated with 16.7 mM glucose in Krebs–Ringer
bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) solution for 1 h. After glucose
stimulation, cells were treated with 2 mM Fluo-4 (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) in calcium and glucose-free KRBB solution
for 30 min in the incubator with light protection, and then washed
three times with calcium and glucose-free KRBB solution. Cells
were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).
Measurement of insulin release
The medium was replaced with defined serum-free medium
containing RGZ, and other inhibitors at the designated concen￾trations. After 24 h of treatment, cells were washed with Krebs￾Ringer-bicarbonate-HEPES (KRBH) buffer and incubated for an
additional 60 min in 1 ml of KRBH buffer containing 5.6 or
16.7 mM of glucose. Insulin secretion was normalized for cell
number by measuring total protein in each experiment with the
Bradford assay, and was determined using a rat insulin ELISA kit
(Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). FFAs including linoleic, oleic and
palmitic acid in 0.01 M NaOH was incubated at 60uC for 30 min,
and then FFAs were complexed with 5% FFA-free BSA in PBS.
The FFA/BSA conjugates were used to treat INS-1 cells.
Perifusion for insulin secretion
After GPR40 RNAi transfection, secreted insulin was measured
in a perifusion system (Cellex biosciences, inc., Minneapolis, MN).
16105 INS-1 cells were cultured in small chambers on Millicell
culture inserts. INS-1 cells were perifused in 3.3 mM glucose
KRBB media for 30 mins at flow rate of 1 ml/min at 37uC
chamber. Glucose concentrations were modified at 16.7 mM
concentration. Fractions were collected at 1 min intervals during
the 1st peak insulin secretion and then collected at 2 min intervals.
Collected fractions were stored at 220uC before performing
insulin ELISA.
Western blotting
Thirty micrograms of proteins per lane were electrophoresed on
10% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with 5%
skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (T￾TBS) for 40 min and incubated overnight at 4uC with the primary
antibodies. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction to determine
FoxO1 cellular localization was made using NE-PER nuclear and
cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to
the manufacturer instructions. Blots were developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence using a standard kit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Western blot band density was analyzed
using a GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA).
Adenovirus infection & RNAi transfection
Adenovirus containing human PPAR-c1 complementary DNA
was presented by Dr. KS Park (Seoul, Korea) and adenovirus
containing rat FoxO1 shRNA was provided by Dr. SH Koo
(Seoul, Korea). Adenoviruses were applied to INS-1 cells and islets
at 3.06106 pfu/ml for PPAR-c overexpression and 1.06106 pfu/
ml for FoxO1 suppression. The efficacy of infection for varying
viral loads was determined by LacZ staining for Ad-PPAR-c and
green fluorescent protein (GFP) observation for Ad-FoxO1-GFP
(Figure S1A). Insulin receptor, GLUT2, and GPR40 sequence￾specific silencing was performed with 100 pM/ml of RNAi
(Bioneer, Daejon, Korea) using HiPerFect transfection reagent
(Invitrogen, San Francisco, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Suppression of target proteins was measured with
Western blots (Fig. S1B).
Hoechst 33258 staining
Hoechst-33258 (bisbenzimide trihydrochloride, HO258; Cal￾biochem, La Jolla, CA) was used to detect cell apoptosis. Nuclei
were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) at 348 nm (excitation) and 480 nm (emission).

Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
All procedures were performed in accordance with the recom￾mendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was
approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of
the Samsung Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI), Sungkyunkwan
University School of Medicine (Permit Number: H-B0-043). Male
OLETF rats and their diabetes-resistant counterparts, LETO rats,
were supplied by Tokushima Research Institute (Otsuka Pharma￾ceutical, Tokushima, Japan) at 8 weeks of age. At an age of 10
weeks, OLETF rats were randomly assigned to the RGZ treatment
or control group, and 3 mg/kg of RGZ was given by mouth
through gavage. After 14 weeks of RGZ treatment (24 weeks of age),
OGTT was performed. Glucose (2 g/kg) solution was given orally,
and serum glucose levels were measured before (0 min) and 30, 60,
90 and 120 min after glucose loading.
Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
One week before the experiment, animals were chronically
cannulated in the jugular vein for infusion of glucose and insulin,
and in the carotid artery for sampling. Cannulae were tunneled
subcutaneously and exteriorized at the back of the neck. Animals were
allowed 7 days to recover from surgery and to regain body weight.
RGZ-treated rats continued to receive a RGZ-containing chow during
the recovery period. Food was withdrawn 6 h before the hyperinsu￾linemic-euglycemic clamping. After 14 weeks of treatment (24 weeks of
age), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed.
Basal samples were drawn at 230 and 0 min. Animals were exposed to
a hyperinsulinemic clamp in which the insulin infusion rates were 4
(sub-maximum) and 40 (maximum) mU/kg/min. Blood was sampled
for measurement of plasma glucose concentration every 5 min and for
insulin levels every 20–30 min. Plasma glucose concentrations were
immediately determined, and the remaining sample was stored at
220uC for later assay.
Immunohistochemistry
At 24 weeks of age, OLETF rats were sacrificed by an intraperitoneal
injection of sodium pentobarbital (45 mg/kg), and all efforts were made
to minimize suffering. Specimens were obtained from the distal end of
the pancreas. The tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sequentially sectioned.
Statistics
The data are presented as the means 6 SD. The Mann-Whitney
tests were performed to compare differences between two independent
groups. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analyses were used to
compare differences between several groups. P values ,0.05 were
considered statistically significant (PRISM; Graphpad Software Corp.,
San Diego, CA).

control), and adenoviral PPAR-c overexpression also exhibits
increased insulin secretion on stimulation with 16.7 mM glucose.
Furthermore, co-treatment with RGZ and PPAR-c overexpression
augmented the insulin secretion compared with PPAR-c overex￾pression alone. However, 10 mM RGZ treatment did not show
any increment in insulin secretion in basal (5.6 mM) glucose
conditions (Fig. 1A, B). The stimulatory activities of 10 mM oleic
or linoleic acids for 30 minutes on insulin secretion were detected
more strongly when pretreated with 10 mM RGZ, indicating that
FFAs amplify RGZ-stimulated insulin secretion from INS-1 cells
(Fig. 1C). In accordance with the results of insulin secretion, Fluo-4
stained intracellular calcium was increased with RGZ treatment or
PPAR-c overexpression compared with control, and co-treatment
with RGZ and PPAR-c overexpression showed a synergetic effect
on intracellular calcium mobilization (Fig. 1D).
RGZ induces intracellular calcium mobilization from
extra- and intra-cellular sources
To determine the sources of increased intracellular calcium in
response to PPAR-c activation, we used 10 mM nifedipine to
block the calcium influx from the extracellular source. Compared
with RGZ treatment alone, co-treatment with RGZ and nifedipine
decreased the Fluo-4 stained calcium (Fig. 2A). As is the case of
nifedipine, 0.1 mM thapsigargin treatment blocked the RGZ￾induced intracellular calcium mobilization (Fig. 2A). Taken
together, PPAR-c activation increases intracellular calcium from
both extra- and intra-cellular sources and as expected, RGZ￾induced insulin secretion was decreased with nifedipine and
thapsigargin treatment under high glucose conditions (Fig. 2B).
RGZ treatment and PPAR-c overexpression increased GLUT2
expression, and co-treatment with RGZ and PPAR-c overexpres￾sion showed a synergetic effect on GLUT2 expression (Fig. 2C). In
addition, GLUT2-specific RNAi blocked a RGZ-induced intra￾cellular calcium mobilization and GSIS (Fig. 2A, B).
PPAR-c activation increases intracellular calcium
concentration and insulin secretion through GPR40 gene
up-regulation
We first investigated whether or not PPAR-c activation up￾regulated GPR40 expression in INS-1 cells. As shown in Figure 3A,
24 h treatment with RGZ and/or adenoviral PPAR-c overex￾pression increased GPR40 expression. In contrast, the level of
expression of cyclic-AMP-responsive exchange factor, Epac2, a
cAMP sensor for Ca2+ mobilization, showed no changes with
RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression (Fig. 3A). However, the
expression of GPR40 was not changed with 1, 4, and 12 h of
treatment with RGZ (Fig. S2A). We next studied whether or not
PPAR-c activation increases calcium mobilization through the
Figure 2. RGZ induces intracellular calcium mobilization from extra- and intra-cellular sources. (A) Effects of nifedipine (10 mM),
thapsigargin (0.1 mM), and GLUT2 sequence-specific silencing with RNAi on 10 mM RGZ-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and (B) insulin

GPR40-mediated PLC signaling pathway. As expected, RGZ￾mediated intracellular calcium mobilization was significantly
reduced with the PLC inhibitor, U-73122, compared to RGZ
alone (Fig. 3B), and insulin secretions was significantly decreased
with the PLC inhibitors compared to RGZ treatment alone
(Fig. 3C).
To further examine the role of GPR40 for RGZ-mediated
insulin secretion, we reduced GPR40 expression in INS-1 cells
with RNA interference (RNAi) specific for rat GPR40. INS-1 cells
expressing RNAi against GPR40 showed nearly 100% reduction
in the protein level compared to cells containing control vector, as
analyzed by Western blot (Fig. S1B). The RGZ-induced increase
in the Ca2+ signal was completely abolished in cells transfected
with GPR40-specific RNAi. Likewise, insulin secretion was
significantly decreased with GPR40 RNAi. Interestingly, U￾73122 treatment showed additional inhibitory effects on insulin
secretion and intracellular calcium mobilization compared to
GPR40 RNAi transfection alone (Fig. 3D, E). Taken together,
these results suggest that RGZ increases intracellular calcium
mobilization and insulin secretion through the GPR40-mediated
PLC signaling pathway in INS-1 cells. In addition, co-treatment
with RGZ and PPAR-c overexpression increased intracellular
calcium mobilization and insulin secretion, and was completely
blocked by the treatment with GLUT2 RNAi or GPR40 RNAi
(Fig. 3F, G).
In perifusion experiments, exposure of the INS-1 cells to
16.7 mM glucose resulted in a rapid increase in 1st and 2nd phase
insulin release above basal level. In addition, the addition of
10 mM RGZ potentiated 2.5- and 1.8-fold in 1st and 2nd phase
insulin release compared to 16.7 mM glucose alone (P,0.05).
However, GPR40 RNAi caused a nearly complete inhibition of
the insulin release evoked by 10 mM RGZ (Fig. 3H).
PPAR-c activation induces the CaMKII and CREB signaling
pathways through GPR40 and GLUT2 gene up-regulation
Next, we examined the downstream signaling pathway of
intracellular calcium mobilization. After treatment with RGZ
and/or PPAR-c overexpression, the phosphorylated levels of
CaMKII and downstream CREB were significantly increased, and
induced an increase in the levels of IRS-2 and phosphorylated Akt.
However, no changes were observed in the level of insulin receptor
expression with treatment of RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression
(Fig. 4A). As shown above, RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression
increased insulin secretion, and thus we examined whether
increased levels of IRS-2 and phosphorylated Akt was due to an
increased insulin autocrine effect or directly due to the up￾regulation of the CaMKII and CREB signaling pathways. After
insulin receptor-specific RNAi, expression of insulin receptor was
completely blocked, and no increases were noted with RGZ and/
or PPAR-c overexpression in insulin receptor expression. How￾ever, the levels of IRS-2 and phosphorylated Akt was increased in
the absence of insulin receptor expression with the treatment of
RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the
increased levels of IRS-2 and phosphorylated Akt by PPAR-c
activation were not by augmented insulin signaling, but by a direct
mechanism mediated by up-regulated CaMKII and CREB
signaling pathways. In addition, the phosphorylated level of Akt
after 10 nM insulin treatment was increased with RGZ and/or
PPAR-c overexpression compared with the non-treated control
(Fig. 4A).
We further examined the roles of PPAR-c activation on b-cell
specific gene expression and whether or not it was mediated by
GPR40 and GLUT2 up-regulation. After treatment with RGZ
and/or PPAR-c overexpression, the level of expression of the b￾cell specific genes, including Pdx-1 and FoxA2, were increased
(Fig. 4B), and the GPR40 RNAi or GLUT2 RNAi reduced the
levels of phospho-CaMKII, phospho-CREB, IRS-2, phospho-Akt,
Pdx-1, and FoxA2 which was mediated by treatment of RGZ and/
or PPAR-c overexpression (Fig. 4C). In addition, the level of
expression of BETA2/NeuroD was increased with the treatment
of RGZ or adenoviral PPAR-c overexpression. However, no
changes were observed in MafA expression with PPAR-c
activation (data not shown).
To determine whether RGZ treatment up-regulates GPR40
expression in a receptor-dependent manner, we treated 50 mM
GW9662 together with RGZ. As a result, the levels of GPR40,
phospho-CaMKII, phospho-CREB, IRS-2, phospho-Akt, Pdx-1,
and FoxA2 were reduced, and therefore it may be that RGZ
treatment increased CaMKII and CREB signaling pathways
through GPR40 up-regulation in a receptor-dependent manner
(Fig. 4D).
PPAR-c activation up-regulates b-cell gene expression
through FoxO1 nuclear exclusion
We examined whether PPAR-c activation affects the nuclear￾cytoplasm shuttling of FoxO1. Under basal condition (serum-free
16.7 mM glucose in RPMI-1640 media), FoxO1 was exclusively
located in the nucleus; however, PPAR-c activation with RGZ
and/or PPAR-c overexpression translocated FoxO1 from nucleus
to cytoplasm in INS-1 cells (Fig. 5A). In agreement with
immunofluorescence staining results, FoxO1 was translocated
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and exclusively located in the
cytoplasm with RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression in Western
blotting (Fig. 5B).
Next, we examined whether or not PPAR-c-mediated FoxO1
nuclear exclusion is dependent on PPAR-c-mediated insulin
secretion. Even though the expression of insulin receptor was
completely blocked with insulin receptor RNAi, FoxO1 was
translocated to the cytoplasm with RGZ treatment (Fig. 5C). In
addition, the expression of b-cell genes, including FoxA2 and Pdx￾1, was up-regulated with RGZ treatment, despite the insulin
receptor RNAi, and combined treatment with RGZ and FoxO1
RNAi showed a synergetic effect on b-cell gene expression

compared to either RGZ treatment or FoxO1 RNAi alone
(Fig. 5C, D).
RGZ treatment prevents lipotoxic and ER stress-induced
b-cell apoptosis
To determine the role of RGZ on b-cell death, we treated INS-1
cells with 1.0 mM palmitate or 50 mM thapsigargin for 24 h and
assessed b-cell apoptosis with Hoechst 33258 staining. The
number of fluorescence-stained cells increased with lipotoxic or
ER stress conditions compared with control cells; however, the
addition of RGZ with palmitate or thapsigargin treatment reduced
b-cell apoptosis (Fig. 6A, B). In support of b-cell apoptosis
prevention, RGZ treatment reduced the level of expression of
CHOP induced by thapsigargin treatment. In addition, RGZ
treatment reduced the levels of expression of ER stress markers
including p-PERK, p-eIF2a, and CHOP induced by 1.0 mM
palmitate (Fig. 6C, D).
PPAR-c activation increases GPR40 expression in primary
rat islets and OLETF rats
In agreement with the results of INS-1 cells, 24 h treatment
with 10 mM RGZ and/or adenoviral PPAR-c overexpression
increased GPR40 expression in primary islets. In addition, PPAR￾c activation with RGZ and/or adenoviral PPAR-c overexpression
increased GSIS in high (16.7 mM) glucose conditions. However,
GSIS did not increase in RGZ treatment in the case of basal
(5.6 mM) glucose conditions (Fig. 7A, B). We next performed
metabolic tests including OGTT and euglycemic clamping. RGZ
treated OLEFT rats showed significantly reduced blood glucose
levels compared with non-treated OLEFT rats (Fig. 7C). To assess
the insulin sensitivity in OLETF rats, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp studies were performed. Maximal glucose infusion rate
(GIR) was significantly higher in RGZ-treated OLETF rats (n = 4)
compared with untreated OLETF rats (n = 4) at 24 weeks
(7.9162.32 mg/kg/min in OLETF rats and 16.1064.39 mg/
kg/min in RGZ-treated OLETF rats, P,0.05). However, there
was no significant difference between treated and untreated
OLETF rats with submaximal GIR (Fig. 7D). In immunohisto￾chemical staining, RGZ-treated islets were relatively well-pre￾served, and there was stronger positive insulin staining. In
addition, GLUT2, IRS-2, Pdx-1, and GPR40 were more strongly
expressed in RGZ-treated islets compared to control islets (Fig. 7E).
Discussion
There is mounting evidence that TZDs protect pancreatic b￾cells from a variety of noxious stimuli, including excessive
nutrients, cytokines, h-IAPP, and ER stress [11–19], and a recent
human study also concurs with the protective role of TZD on b￾cell function compared to other anti-diabetic drugs, such as

sulfonylurea and metformin [34]. However, it is still obscure as to
the precise mechanisms of PPAR-c activation that regulate b-cell
function and mass, and although there are many studies that
TZDs protect b-cells from lipoapoptosis in diabetic rats [17], it is
still elusive whether the protective role of TZDs is direct or
secondary to lowered blood glucose from improved insulin
sensitivity. Moreover, there is significant controversy about
whether or not PPAR-c activation increases GSIS in pancreatic
b-cells. Some of the previous studies have shown that PPAR-c
activation with TZDs and/or PPAR-c overexpression is detri￾mental to b-cell function, and suppresses insulin secretion and
proinsulin biosynthesis [7,35–38]. For example, it has been
reported that troglitazone activates AMP-activated protein kinase
and inhibits insulin secretion from MIN6 cells [37], and PPAR-c
overexpression suppresses insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic
islets through induction of UCP-2 protein [35]. Moreover,
Schinner et al. [39] reported that human insulin gene promoter
activity is inhibited by RGZ and PPAR-c. However, other studies
have demonstrated the contradictory results of TZDs or PPAR-c,
which showed the PPAR-c-stimulated insulin secretion in pancre￾atic b-cells [3,8–10]. In terms of b-cell gene expression, Moibi et al.
[6] showed that Pdx-1, Nkx6.1, glucokinase and GLUT2 were
increased after treatment with troglitazone for 3 days in INS-1
cells, and knockdown of PPAR-c with RNAi lowered the mRNA
levels of Pdx-1, glucokinase, GLUT2, and proinsulin II by more
than half. Moreover, it was reported that some of the key b-cell
genes, including Pdx-1, GLUT2, and glucokinase, have PPRE in
the promoter region [4,5,40].
In the current study, we showed that RGZ and/or adenoviral
PPAR-c overexpression increase insulin secretion in high glucose
conditions, and intracellular calcium mobilization is important in
this step. Therefore, treatment with nifedipine and thapsigargin
that blocked the extracellular and intracellular calcium sources,
respectively, decreased RGZ-induced insulin secretion. Apart from
insulin secretion, RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression increase b￾cell gene expression including Pdx-1, FoxA2, and BETA2/
NeuroD. Similar to our results, Richardson et al. [41] showed
that .24 h treatment with RGZ promoted the nuclear accumu￾lation of IPF1 and FoxA2 independent of glucose concentration,
and stimulated a two-fold increase in the activity of the Ipf1 gene
promoter. Several explanations are possible regarding the
mechanism of PPAR-c-induced b-cell gene expression. First,
putative PPRE was identified in the mouse Pdx-1 promoter, and
TZDs increase Pdx-1 expression through a PPAR-c-mediated
mechanism [4]. Second, it may be possible that the increased Pdx￾1 and FoxA2 expression is due to FoxO1 nuclear exclusion by
PPAR-c activation. Because FoxO1 and FoxA2 share common
DNA binding sites in the Pdx-1 promoter, they compete with each
other for binding to the Pdx-1 promoter [42]. Therefore, RGZ￾induced FoxO1 nuclear exclusion leads to increase FoxA2 binding
to the Pdx-1 promoter, resulting up-regulation of Pdx-1 gene
expression. To exclude the possibility that RGZ treatment induces

FoxO1 nuclear exclusion merely through the increased insulin
secretion, we blocked the insulin signaling pathway via insulin
receptor RNAi, and assessed FoxO1 cellular localization.
Although, the expression of insulin receptor was completely
blocked, FoxO1 was translocated from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm with the RGZ treatment, and thus it seems that there
may be a direct mechanism in PPAR-c-induced FoxO1 nuclear
exclusion rather than PI3K–Akt pathway mediated FoxO1
shuttling. In agreement with our findings, Dowell et al. [43]
reported that FoxO1 was identified as a PPAR-c-interacting
protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and PPAR-c and RXRa
expression vector and/or RGZ treatment resulted in a dose￾dependent inhibition of Foxo1-driven reporter activity. Interest￾ingly, PPARc-induced increased calcium mobilization and insulin
secretion is mediated by FFA receptor GPR40 gene induction, and
was completely blocked by the PLC inhibitor, U-73122, or direct
GPR40 RNAi. This is the first evidence showing the novel
mechanism of PPAR-c that increases insulin secretion in
pancreatic b-cells. In addition, the expression of Pdx-1 and FoxA2
following RGZ treatment and/or PPAR-c overexpression was up￾regulated in a GPR40-dependent manner. In agreement with our
findings, it has been reported that the HR region in the 59-flanking
region of the GPR40 gene showed a strong b-cell-specific
enhancer activity, and can bind the Pdx-1 and BETA2 both in
vitro and in vivo [44].
Recently, Gras et al. [32] reported that TZDs bind to the
GPR40 receptor, resulting in Ca2+ mobilization from ER calcium
stores, and which induce the proliferation of non-malignant
human bronchial epithelial cells. However, the non-TZD PPAR-c
ligand, 15 d-PGJ2, did not induce any Ca2+ signal and instead
inhibited cell growth. Collectively, this study suggested that TZDs
increase intracellular calcium through the GPR40 activation in a

receptor-independent manner. The receptor-independent effects
of TZDs include anti-inflammatory actions, anti-proliferative
effects and cell apoptosis, inhibition of mitochondrial function,
and modification of energy metabolism, and based on several
findings include the following: (1) the concentrations needed to
demonstrate TZD actions were much greater than the reported

EC50 values; (2) non-TZD agonists showed little or no effect; (3)
PPAR-c antagonists did not block TZD effects; (4) effects occurred
rapidly (within minutes to hours); and (5) effects occurred in the
absence of PPAR-c expression or of PPRE in gene promoters [45].
However, GPR40 induction through PPAR-c activation was
shown to be a receptor-dependent effect in ours. First, we
demonstrated increased GPR40 expression and subsequent insulin
secretion with RGZ treatment for 24 h, and no changes in GPR40
expression and insulin secretion were noted with short-term (1, 4,
and 12 h) treatment (Fig. S2A, B). Second, GW9662, a PPAR-c
antagonist, completely blocked RGZ-induced GSIS and insulin
biosynthesis in our previous report [9], and the levels of GPR40,
phospho-CaMKII, phospho-CREB, IRS-2, phospho-Akt, Pdx-1,
and FoxA2 were reduced by GW9662, and therefore it is more
likely that PPAR-c activation induces GPR40 expression through
receptor-dependent manner in pancreatic b-cells. In this study,
although short-term (less than 24 h) treatment with RGZ did not
increase GPR40 expression and insulin secretion in pancreatic b￾cells, 10 mM of PGJ2 for 10 minutes increased intracellular
calcium mobilization and insulin secretion. In contrast, 24 h
treatment with PGJ2 did not show any intracellular calcium
mobilization or GPR40, phospho-CaMKII, phospho-CREB, IRS￾2, phospho-Akt, Pdx-1, and FoxA2 induction (data not shown). In
contrast to our results, 1 h exposure to FFAs significantly
enhanced GSIS and increased expression of PDX-1 and GLUT2
in pSilencer-control transfected cells, but not in cells transfected
with GPR40shRNA. While long term (48 h) exposure to FFAs
significantly impaired GSIS in control and GPR40shRNA cells.
Furthermore, pioglitazone enhanced insulin secretion in pSilencer￾control transfected cells exposed to FFAs for 48 h, but not in cells
transfected with GPR40shRNA [46]. Although we do not know
why there is a discrepancy in the mechanism of GPR40 induction
through PPAR-c activation, it may be primarily due to the
difference in cell type and experimental conditions.
Despite the link between GPR40 and PPAR-c mediated insulin
secretion, another mechanism still can be considered. For
example, it has recently been reported that the ATP-binding
cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a cellular cholesterol transporter,
in beta cell cholesterol homeostasis and insulin secretion. Briefly,
mice with specific inactivation of Abca1 in beta cells showed
marked impairment of glucose tolerance and defective insulin
secretion. Importantly, RGZ up-regulated Abca1 in beta-cells, and
reduced islet free cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not beta￾cell specific Abca1 lacking mice. This was associated with
significantly improved glucose tolerance in wild-type mice with
no effect of RGZ on glucose tolerance in mice deficient for beta￾cell Abca1. Therefore, in addition to the up-regulation of GPR40,
PPAR-gamma may activate beta-cell Abca1 and subsequent
reduction of islet fat content is an important mechanism by which
RGZ increases insulin secretion [47,48].
In the present study, the phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and
CREB, IRS-2, and phospho-Akt were up-regulated by PPAR-c
activation. To determine whether or not the increased IRS-2 and
phospho-Akt was due to increased insulin signaling or directly due
to the up-regulation of the CaMKII and CREB signaling pathway,
we knocked down the insulin receptor with RNAi. Even after
insulin receptor RNAi, IRS-2 and phospho-Akt levels were
increased with treatment of RGZ and/or PPAR-c overexpression.
Therefore, increased IRS-2 and phospho-Akt levels are direct
through the up-regulated CaMKII and CREB signaling pathways
and these results may partly explain the protective role of RGZ
from lipotoxic or ER stress induced b-cell apoptosis in this study.
In contrast to the short-term effect of FFAs on insulin secretion,
long-term exposure of islets to FFAs results in impaired GSIS
through intracellular accumulation of lipid signaling molecules
that inhibit insulin secretion [23]. Therefore, some studies
questioned the beneficial role of GPR40 on b-cell function. Lan
et al. [49] suggested that even though GPR40 is required for
normal insulin secretion in response to FFAs, Ffar1+/+ and Ffar12/
2 mice had similar weight, adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, and lipid
accumulation in livers on high-fat diets. Moreover, Steneberg et al.
[50] showed that GPR40-deficient b-cells secrete less insulin in
response to FFAs, and loss of GPR40 protects mice from obesity￾induced metabolic derangements. Conversely, overexpression of
GPR40 in b-cells leads to impaired b-cell function, hypoinsulin￾emia, and diabetes, therefore, the authors suggested that GPR40
may play a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, it was reported that GPR40 activation may have the
potential to inhibit insulin secretion through the opening of ATP￾dependent K+ channels in rat b-cells [51]. At present, we could not
explain the reason why the studies showed a different role of
GPR40 from our results, and therefore further studies are
necessary to clarify the role of GPR40 on pancreatic b-cell
function following stimulation with FFAs and during the
development of diabetes.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PPAR-c activation
through TZDs and/or adenoviral overexpression increases intra￾cellular calcium mobilization and insulin secretion in INS-1 cells,
and which was mediated by the up-regulation of FFA receptor
GPR40 and GLUT2 expression. Moreover, the PPAR-c-mediated
GPR40 activation increased the level of expression of b-cell genes,
including Pdx-1 and FoxA2.
