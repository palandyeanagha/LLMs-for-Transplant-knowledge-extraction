A B S T R A C T Metabolism of [3H]25-hydroxyvitamin
D3(25-OH-D3) was studied in primary cultures of pul￾monary alveolar macrophages (PAM) from seven pa￾tients with sarcoidosis and two patients with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. Production of a [3H]1,25-dihy￾droxyvitamin D3 (1,25-[OH]2-D3)-like metabolite of
[3H]25-OH-D3 was detected in lipid extracts of cells
from five patients with sarcoidosis. Synthesis of this
compound in vitro was limited to viable PAM and was
greatest in cells derived from a patient with hyper￾calcemia and an elevated serum concentration of 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D. The tritiated PAM metabolite
coeluted with authentic 1,25-(OH)2-D3 in three differ￾ent solvent systems on straight-phase high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and demonstrated
binding to extracted receptor for 1,25-(OH)2-D3, which
was identical to that of commercially available [3H]1,25-
(OH)2-D3 of comparable specific activity. Incubation
of PAM with high concentrations of 25-OH-D3 resulted
in production of an unlabeled metabolite that co-chro￾matographed with the 3H-PAM metabolite on HPLC
and that was bound with high affinity by both the spe￾cific receptor for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 and antiserum to 1,25-
(OH)2-D3.
INTRODUCTION
Disordered calcium metabolism is a frequently en￾countered clinical problem in sarcoidosis. The re￾ported incidence of hypercalcemia in the disease may
range as high as 20% (1), while the incidence of hy￾Received for publication 8 June 1983 and in revised form
18 August 1983.
percalciuria, a major source of morbidity in sarcoid￾osis, may be twice as great (2). The proposed etiology
for this phenomenon is extrarenal overproduction of
the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy￾vitamin D (1,25-[OH]2-D)' (3, 4). A possible cellular
source for 1,25-(OH)2-D or a related sterol is the mac￾rophage, a ubiquitous constituent of the noncaseating
granulomata of sarcoidosis. In this report, we dem￾onstrate production in vitro of a 1,25-dihydroxyvita￾min D3 (1,25-(OH)2-D3)-like metabolite of [3H]25-hy￾droxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) by primary cultures of
pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) harvested
from patients with active sarcoidosis.
METHODS
Patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in seven
patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis and two patients
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Five patients with sar￾coidosis had roentgenographic evidence of diffuse infiltra￾tive pulmonary disease with or without hilar lymphadenop￾athy (stage II or III), while two patients demonstrated only
hilar lymph node involvement (stage I). Lavage was per￾formed on two separate occasions in one patient (Patient 1,
Table I) with active pulmonary sarcoidosis; it was done ini￾tially when his serum concentration of calcium was 15.1 mg/
dl (normal, 8.5-10.5 mg/dl) and his serum 1,25-(OH)2-D
level (5) was 94 pg/ml (normal, 30-70 pg/ml) and 4 mo
hence, after self-initiated withdrawal from glucocorticoid
therapy, when he had a serum calcium concentration of 9.7

mg/dl. Another subject (Patient 2, Table I) had a normal
serum concentration of calcium (9.8 mg/dl) and 1,25-(OH)2-
D (51 pg/ml) but was hypercalciuric (0.31 mg calcium/100
ml glonmerular filtrate, normal < 0.16) at the time of lavage.
None of the other patients from whom lavage specimens
were obtained had past or current evidence of either hy￾percalcemia or hypercalciuria. No patients were receiving
glucocorticoid treatment.
Cell cultuires. Primarv monolayer cultures of PAM were
established by standard techniques (6) from 40 to 60 ml of
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Harvested cells were plated in
Costar plasticw,are (Costar, Cambridge, NMA) at an approx￾imate density of 2 X 105 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's NMedium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
4 mM glutamine, 10 ug/ml insulin, 50 U/ml penicillin, and
50 ,g/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco Laboratories, Grand
Island, NY) and maintained in an atmosphere of 5% C02:95%
air at 37°C. Nonadherent cells were decanted in the culture
medium 12-24 h after plating the cells. Thereafter, the culture
medium vas changed twice weekly. Nonviable macrophages
(ascertained by failure to exclude trypan blue) were harvested
from the culture medium and retained for use as controls in
subsequent experiments.
[311]25-OH-D3 metabolism. After 7-12 d in primary cull￾ture, the homogeneity of the cell populations was confirmed
by histochemical staining for nonspecific esterase activity by
using a-napthyl acetate as substrate (7), and the culture me￾dium was decanted and replaced with serum-free BGJb me￾dium. After a 36-h preincubation period, this medium was
replaced with serum-free BGjb medium containing 5 nM
[26,27-methyl-3H]25-OH-D3 (Amersham Corp., Arlington
IHeights, IL) solubilized in 0.1% absolute ethanol. [3H]25-
01-D3 wvas purified on a silica Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters
Associates, Milford, MA) before use (8). Cultuires were in￾cubated for 3 h at 370C in [3H]25-OH1-D3-containing medium.
At the conclusion of 3-h incubation period, the medium was
aspirated and the cell monolayer harvested by gentle scraping.
The lipid was extracted from the cells and the incubation
medium in methanol-methylene chloride, and the resultant
extracts were chromatographed oin silica Sep-Pak cartridges.
The builk of the radioactivity in the form of unmetabolized
[3H]25-OH-D3 was eluted in 15 ml of 25/c ethylacetate in n￾hexane. More polar material was eluted in 15 ml of 100%
ethylacetate. The latter fraction was evaporated under ni￾trogen and resolubilized for straight-phase high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) over a 3.9 mm X 30 cm
AuPorasil column (WVaters Associates) in a mobile phase of
92% n-hexane:4% methanol:4% isopropanol eluting at 2.0
ml/min. Each sample was co-chromatographed with crys￾taline standards of 25-OH-D3, 24(R),25-(OH)2-D3, 25,26-
(O1)2-D13, and I,25-(OH)2-D3; and the radioactivity coeluting
with unlabeled standards was determined. Co-chromatog￾raphy of labeled product vith 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was confirmed
in each case by straight-phase HIPLC in a different solvent
system of 98% methylene chloride:2% methanol (see Fig. 1
C). The quantity of labeled metabolite co-chromatographing
with 1,25-(Oli)2-D3 was expressed in terms of femtomoles
per 106 cells per minute-' (specific activity). Parallel incu￾bations of cultured rat intestinal epitheliai cells (IEC) (9),
nonviable macrophages, and culture medium alone with
[3H]1,25-(OH)2-D3 served as controls in vitro.
25-011-D3 metabolism. Primary cultures of PAM from
Patient lb (Table I) containing -l0 X 10' cells were prein￾cubated in serum-free BGJb medium for 12 h and then exposed
to 200 nM 25-OH-D3 for 12 h. The incubation medium was
collected and the lipid was extracted, chromatographed on
silica Sep-Paks, and stored in ethanol at -70°C under ni￾trogen. Serum-containiing medium was replaced for 48 h,
and the above procedure was repeated. After six such cyclic
incubation periods, the six extracts were pooled, spiked with
tracer amounts (2 pCi) of the 1,25-(OH)2-D3-like 3H-PAM
metabolite, and chromatographed successively on straight￾phase HPLC in 92% n-hexane:4% methanol:4% isopropanol,
98% methylene chloride:2% methanol, and 95% methylene
chloride:5% isopropanol. The unlabeled PAM metabolite that
was co-chromatographing with the 3H-PAM metabolite was
quantitated by its UV absorbance at 254 nM in a Waters 440
in-line detector.
Metabolite binding. The binding of the labeled and un￾labeled PAM metabolite to the chick intestinal cytosol receptor
for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 and to an antibody generated against 1,25-
(OH)2-D3 was compared with that of commercially available
[3H]1 ,25-(OH)2-D3 and authentic 1,25-(OH)2-D3, respectively.
High affinity receptor for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was extracted in
TKM buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI [pH 7.4], 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM
dithiothreitol, 300 mM KCI, and 10 mM sodium molybdate)
from a high-speed centrifugate (100,000 g for 1 h) of rachitic
chick duodenal mucosa (10). 1-ml aliquots of the resultant
cytosol preparation (diluted 1:40 with TKM buffer) were added
to sterols solubilized in 20 ,1l of ethanol and incubated for
1 h at 23°C. The 1,25-(OH)2-D3 antiserum, that was raised
in sheep immunized with 1,25-dihydroxy-25-hemisuccinate
vitamin D3, was kindly provided by Dr. Tom Clemens. The
radioimmunioassay, which used serial dilutions of the PAM
metabolite as unlabeled ligand, was performed by a modi￾fication of the method of Clemens et al. (11). In both assay
systems, bound radioactivity was separated from unbound
label by dextran-coated charcoal and quantitated by scin￾tillation counting.
RESULTS
Table I shows the results of the [3H]25-OH-D3 metab￾olism experiments in PAM cultures from the five pa￾tients with sarcoidosis in which 1,25-(OH)2-D3-co￾chromatographing material was identified. In the
initial experiment, [3H]25-OH-D3 metabolism was ex￾amined in primary PAM cultures from the index case
(Patient 1) with sarcoidosis-associated hypercalcemia.
In the lipid extracts of both macrophages and their
incubation medium, there was a homogeneous peak of
radiolabeled material that co-chromatographed with
authentic 1,25-(OH)2-D3 on HPLC in 92% n-hexane:4%
methanol:4% isopropanol; 11.1 and 3.7% (total 14.8%)
of the lipid-extractable label in the cells and incubation
medium, respectively, co-chromatographed with 1,25-
(OH)2-D3. Readmission of the index case to the hospital
with an exacerbation of his pulmonary disease provided
an opportunity to reevaluate the metabolic capacity of
PAM from this patient when he was not overtly hy￾percalcemic. As was demonstrated in the initial ex￾periments with cells from this host, [3H]25-OH-D3 was
metabolized to a more polar product which co-chro￾matographed with 1,25-(OH)2-D3 on HPLC. However,
the yield of metabolite at the same substrate concen￾tration was reduced 75% when compared with that of
PAM from the initial harvest. To verify the elution

t Cultures from patient 1 were established and examined on two
separate occasions, initially (a) when he was hypercalcemic and
subsequently (b) when he was not. The use of [3H]25-OH-D3 of
higher specific activity in subsequent incubations of cells from the
index case and other patients was elected in order to maximize the
yield of high specific activity product from replicate cultures.

of the PAM extract was co-chromatographed in two
additional solvent systems on straight-phase HPLC (Fig.
1). In all three solvent systems evaluated, there was
co-chromatography of the tritiated PAM metabolite
with standard 1,25-(OH)2-D3.
After incubation with [3H]25-OH-D3, 1,25-(OH)2-D3-
co-chromatographing sterol was detected in PAM cul￾tures from four additional patients with sarcoidosis; all
of these patients had stage II or III pulmonary disease
(Table I). With the exception of cells from Patient 2,
who was hypercalciuric at the time of the study, the
specific activity of the PAM-derived enzyme was at
least an order of magnitude below that of cells from
the hypercalcemic patient. Labeled metabolite with
the chromatographic mobility of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was
not identified in extracts of PAM from either of the
two patients with stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis or the
two patients with nonsarcoidosis-related pulmonary
disease. In addition to being specific for cells from a
host with sarcoidosis, production of the [3H]1,25-(OH)2-
D3-like metabolite was also specific for viable PAM.
Incubation of nonviable PAM (n = 6) and IEC cell
cultures (n = 6) with [3H]25-OH-D3 failed to result in
production of material that co-chromatographed on
HPLC with 1,25-(OH)2-D3. However, IEC cells did
synthesize a substantial amount of a periodate-sensitive
(12), radiolabeled product (5.2±2.1% [mean±SD] of the
total lipid-extractable tritium) that co-chromatographed
with 24(R),25-(OH)2-D3. Lipid extracts of medium
alone contained no product more polar than the starting
material, [3H]25-OH-D3.
In an attempt to functionally characterize the tritiated
metabolite, the PAM-derived material was employed
as radiolabeled ligand for binding to the high-affinity
intracellular binding protein (receptor) for 1,25-(OH)2-
D3 (Fig. 2). Displacement of the labeled PAM metab￾olite and commercially available [3H]1,25-(OH)2-D3
from extracted receptor by increasing the concentra￾tions of unlabeled 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was identical. To
generate unlabeled metabolite for ligand binding stud￾ies, we took advantage of the fact that approximately
25% of the metabolite synthesized by monolayer PAM
cultures reappears in the incubation medium. Repet￾itive incubation of cells from a single host (Patient lb,
Table I) with 200 nM 25-OH-D3 yielded a detectable
quantity of unlabeled metabolite that co-chromato￾A

used (Fig. 1). Assuming the metabolite possessed the
same UV absorption spectrum as its precursor, 25-OH￾D3, the HPLC-purified compound was equivalent to
60 pmol of 1,25-(OH)2-D3. As shown in Fig. 3, the
displacement of [3H]1,25-(OH)2-D3 from both the re￾ceptor for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 and antibody to the hormone
was identical for equimolar concentrations of the PAM
metabolite and authentic 1,25-(OH)2-D3.
DISCUSSION
It is now recognized that the macrophage is capable
of synthesizing a variety of compounds with proven or
potential bioactivity. These products include a number
of peptides, nucleotide metabolites, reactive oxygen
metabolites, arachidonic acid derivatives (13-16), and
potent androgenic steroids (17). In the present report,
we demonstrate that cultured PAM from patients with
active pulmonary sarcoidosis metabolize a sterol hor￾mone precursor, 25-OH-D3, to a 1,25-(OH)2-D3-like
metabolite. Production of this compound in vitro was
observed only in cells from patients with diffuse pul￾monary sarcoidosis (stage II or III) and was greatest in
PAM derived from patients with either hypercalcemia
or hypercalciuria. Coelution of the PAM metabolite
and authentic 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was documented in three
different mobile phases on straight-phase HPLC (Fig.
1). Co-chromatography of PAM metabolite and 1,25-
(OH)2-D3 in a mobile phase of 98% methylene chlo￾ride:2% methanol (Fig. 1 C) was of particular interest.
According to a recent report by Gray et al. (18), this
solvent system successfully separated 1,25-(OH)2-D3
from a [3H]25-OH-D3 metabolite produced by rodent
peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, the metabolite
synthesized by rodent macrophages and that of human
PAM origin are probably different.
Repetitive incubation of PAM from a sarcoid patient
(Patient lb, Table I) with high concentrations of un￾labeled 25-OH-D3 resulted in production of metabolite
that co-chromatographed on HPLC with [3H]1,25-
(OH)2-D3 as well as the 3H-PAM metabolite. In addition,
the unlabeled PAM metabolite from this host was bound

with high affinity to both specific receptor for 1,25-
(OH)2-D3 and antibody to 1,25-(OH)2-D3. While these
data strongly suggest that the macrophage may be the
synthetic source of "serum-assayable" 1,25-(OH)2-D in
sarcoidosis, they do not exclude the possibility that the
PAM-derived metabolite is chromatographically and
functionally similar but structurally different from 1,25-
(OH)2-D3. Absolute identity of the macrophage me￾tabolite must await structural identification of the com￾pound.
