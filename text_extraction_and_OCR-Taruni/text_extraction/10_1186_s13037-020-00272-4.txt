Abstract
Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are common healthcare-associated infections and associated with
prolonged hospital stays, additional financial burden, and significantly hamper the potential benefits of surgical
interventions. Causes of SSIs are multi-factorials and patients undergoing gastrointestinal tract procedures carry a
high risk of bacterial contamination. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, associated factors, and causing
microorganisms of SSIs among patients undergoing gastrointestinal tract surgeries.
Methods: A hospital based, cross-sectional study conducted at Soba University Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. We
included all patients from all age groups attending the gastrointestinal tract surgical unit between 1st September and
31st December 2017. We collected data about the socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors of SSI, and isolated
microorganisms from patients with SSIs. A Chi-square test was conducted to determine the relationship between the
independent categorical variables and the occurrence of SSI. The significance level for all analyses was set at p < .05.
Results: A total of 80 participants were included in the study. The mean age was 51 +/- 16 years and most of the
patients (67.5%) did not have any chronic illness prior to the surgical operation. Most of them (46.3%) of them
underwent large bowel surgery. Twenty-two patients (27.5%) developed SSI post operatively and superficial SSI was the
most common type of SSIs (81.8%). Occurrence of SSI was found to be associated with long operation time (p > .001),
malignant nature of the disease (p > .001), intra-operative blood loss (p > .001), and intra-operative hypotension
(p = .013). The most prevalent microorganism isolated from SSI patients was E coli (47.8%), followed by Enterococcus
fecalis (13.0%) and combined Pseudomonas aeruginosa + E coli infection (13.0%).
Conclusions: The results showed a high prevalence of SSIs among patients attending the gastrointestinal tract surgical
unit and the most prevalent microorganism isolated from them was E coli. Measures should be taken to reduce the
magnitude of SSI by mitigating the identified associated factors.

Introduction
Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most frequent type of
healthcare-associated infections, accounting for 14% − 25%
of the total hospital-acquired infections [1, 2]. SSI is associ￾ated with a prolonged hospital stay, long-term disability,
and additional financial burden, and significantly hampers
the potential benefits of surgical interventions [3]. Notably,
SSI is theoretically preventable but requires a particular
investigation of early diagnosis and intervention [3].
The incidence of SSIs can vary across surgical proce￾dures, specialties, and conditions, with a range of 0.1–
50.4% as reported in a 2017-systematic review [4]. A
prevalence survey in the UK National Health Service
(NHS) indicated that approximately 8% of all patients
(5743 out of 75,694 patients over a four-month period)
admitted to hospital suffered healthcare-associated
infections, with 15% of these infections being SSIs, and
similar estimates have been found in France [3]. In
Africa, the impact of SSIs ranged from 6.8–26% with
predominance in the general surgeries [4].
Although there are global variations around the
definition of an SSI, the European Commission classified
SSIs into superficial incisional surgical site infection,
deep incisional surgical site infection, or surgical site in￾fection - organ/space, and the diagnostic criteria include
the presence of one of the signs of infection (tenderness,
swelling, reddening, and elevated skin temperature),
purulent discharge from the incision site, and positive
result of microbiological examination of material collected
or after the surgical opening of the incision site [5, 6].
While the causes of SSIs are multi-factorial, recognized
risk factors include the length of hospital stay, obesity,
patient co-morbidities, duration and complexity of the
surgery, and higher wound contamination classification
[7]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), classified wounds by their level of contamination
as Clean (Class 1): which are non infective operative
wounds in which no inflammation is encountered, with
no involvement of respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitouri￾nary tract, and oropharyngeal cavity; Clean-contaminated
(Class 2): operative wounds in which either the respira￾tory, gastrointestinal or the genitourinary tract is entered
under controlled conditions and with the only minor
contamination, as resulted from operations involving the
biliary tract, appendix, and oropharynx, provided no
evidence of infection or a major break in sterile technique
is encountered; Contaminated (Class 3): fresh, accidental
wounds, resulting from operations with major breaks in
sterile technique or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal
tract, and incisions in which acute, non purulent
(free from pus) inflammation is encountered; and
Dirty (Class 4): old traumatic wounds with retained
devitalized tissue and those that involve existing
clinical infection or perforated viscera [8].
The risk of SSI is related to the level of contamination
of the wound as demonstrated in a recent surveillance of
surgical infections in NHS hospitals in England, which
showed that the SSI risk following gastrointestinal tract
procedures (especially large bowel surgery) reached 9.0%
in 2018/19 [9]. While SSIs could be prevented by identi￾fying and mitigating the predisposing factors, SSIs still
have a significant burden on both the patient and health
system in Sub Saharan Africa countries, where resources
are limited, and the wound infection rates are higher
than developed countries [10, 11]. Moreover, there is a
knowledge gap regarding SSIs incidence, related factors
and microorganism in Sudan. Therefore, this study
aimed to determine the burden, associated factors, and
the most prevalent microorganisms of SSIs among pa￾tients undergoing gastrointestinal tract surgeries.
Materials and methods
Study design and setting
A prospective, hospital based, descriptive cross-sectional
study conducted at Soba University Hospital in
Khartoum, Sudan during the period between 1st Sep￾tember and 31st December 2017. The Hospital is affili￾ated with the University of Khartoum and provides a
host of therapeutic and diagnostic services at the highest
level in Sudan through specialized units served by well
trained healthcare staff. The current capacity of the hos￾pital is approximately 500 beds and there are two gen￾eral surgery units at the department of surgery. One of
them is particularly specialized in the gastrointestinal
and hepato-biliary conditions. Patients are booked for
surgery from the referred clinics and then organized in
the elective operations lists.
Data collection and analysis
We included all patients from all age groups attending
the gastrointestinal tract surgical unit during the study
who underwent surgical procedures. Patients who died
after admission to the hospital and before undergoing
surgical procedures were excluded from the study. Each
patient eligible for the inclusion in this study were
enrolled consecutively and followed from the time of
admission until time of discharge using a structured
questionnaire, which was used to collect data adopted
from a variety of literature.
The primary outcomes variable for this study were rate
of SSI and type of the causing microorganisms. Diagno￾sis of SSI was made according to the after-mentioned
criteria of the Centres for Diseases Control and Preven￾tion. Data were collected from the medical records of
patients including the operational and anesthetic sheets.
We collected data about the socio-demographic charac￾teristics, relevant clinical characteristics related to SSIs,
Hassan et al. Patient Safety in Surgery (2020) 14:45 Page 2 of 7

and data about the isolated microorganisms from
patients with SSIs.
Several patients’ clinical conditions have been de￾scribed in the literature as risk factors to SSI [4, 12–28].
Based on the literature review and availability of the
data, we assessed the following independent variables in
this study: site of operation, type of operation, nature of
the disease (benign vs. malignant), history of chronic
illnesses (hypertension, heart diseases, and diabetes
mellitus), surgical wound classification, duration of
surgery, type of antibiotics prophylaxis, having bowel
preparation prior to surgery, intra-operative blood loss,
and intra-operative hypotension. After completion of
data collection, data analysis was done using the SPSS
software version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A
Chi-square test was conducted to determine the
relationship between the independent categorical vari￾ables and the occurrence of SSI. The significance level
for all analyses was set at p < .05.
Results
General characteristics of the participants
A total of 80 participants were included in the study.
Patients’ ages ranged from 20 to 98 years and the me￾dian age was 52 years (interquartile range: 25 years).
53.8% of them were males and 46.3% were females. Most
of the patients (67.5%) did not have any chronic illness
prior to the surgical operation and 46.3% of them under￾went large bowel surgery. Thirty nine patients (48.8%)
underwent clean-contaminated surgeries as well as another
39 patients underwent contaminated surgeries (Table 1).

Regarding preparation to surgery, all of patients received
antibiotics prophylaxis preoperatively except one patient
and near half of the patients (47.1%) received bowel prepar￾ation medications. Half of the patients (50.0%) received 2nd
generation cephalosporin as a preoperative antibiotics
prophylaxis, whilst 43.8% of them received both 2nd gener￾ation cephalosporin and Metronidazol as a preoperative
antibiotics prophylaxis. However, most of them (81.2%) did
not have documentation for the timing of administra￾tion of antibiotics prophylaxis preoperatively. Among
the remaining who have complete data, (25%) and
(62.5%) were given antibiotics 20 and 30 minutes before
the operation, respectively. The majority (95.0%) did
not receive second dose of antibiotics (Table 2).
SSI prevalence, associated factors, and isolated
microorganisms
Twenty-two patients (27.5%) developed SSI post opera￾tively; eight patients developed SSI in the period of 3–4
days postoperatively, nine patients developed the infec￾tion in the period of 5–6 days postoperatively, and five
developed the infection one week after the operation.
Most of SSI cases (86.8%) were detected during hospital
stay periods and the remaining cases were detected in
the post-discharge follow-ups. Superficial SSI was the
most common type of SSIs (82.6%).
Occurrence of SSI was found to be associated with
long operation time of more than three hours (p > .001),
malignant surgical diseases (p > .001), intra-operative
blood loss (p > .001), and intra-operative hypotension
(p = .013). The most prevalent microorganism isolated
from SSI patients was E. coli (47.8%), followed by Entero￾coccus fecalis (13.0%) and combined Pseudomonas aeru￾ginosa + E. coli infection (13.0%) (Table 3).
Discussion
Reducing the risk of SSIs is dependent on identifying the
risk factors as well as developing the needed measures

for prevention and management [29]. An artificial neural
network analysis for prediction of SSIs showed that the
interaction between the risk factors is complex and
depicted that some factors, such as preoperative white
blood cell count and wound classification, could be more
important than other variables [30].
The results of this study showed that 27.1% of the
patients had SSI. Several risk factors were found to be
significantly associated with the development of SSI in￾cluding: malignant nature of the disease, intra-operative
blood loss, intra-operative hypotension, and long oper￾ation time. Majority of the patients had superficial
wound infections, which were discovered mostly during
post-operative hospital stay with drainage from the
wound site 5–6 days post operatively. Those patients
with SSIs were handled according to the standard guide￾lines and wound dressing twice per day was offered for
patients with SSI.
The higher risk of acquiring SSI among patients with
malignant diseases compared to patients with benign
diseases is reasonable since malignancy is associated
with weak immune system and vulnerability to various
infections, and it is consistent with studies reported that
SSI was observed in 30–60% of patients after colorectal
cancer surgeries [5, 16, 17]. The lack of association
between SSI and timing of antibiotics prophylaxis in
this study is similar to another retrograde cohort
study [31]. According to the standard guidelines,
antibiotics prophylaxis should be given 60 minutes
before the incision in most of types of antibiotics
and doubling of the dose should be considered when
the duration of operation exceeds 4 hours [32].
There was a significant association between SSI and
intra-operative blood loss of more than 500 ml like an￾other study showed the 26.1% of those who had massive
intra-operative blood loss developed wound infection
[18]. This is relevant since blood loss is directly related
to decreased tissue oxygenation and aiding in the develop￾ment of SSI. Also, intra-operative hypotension is found to
be strongly related to SSI as previously reported [19, 20],
and this is related to the poor wound perfusion resulting
from intra-operative hypotension.
The association between SSI and long duration of oper￾ation of more than 180 min match a systematic review
that showed the same results in most of its studies [21]. It
has been demonstrated that there was an 80% increase in
likelihood of SSI with surgeries longer (versus shorter)
than three hours [4]. Prolonged operative time allows time
for over- handling the wound edges and also contact with
contaminated fluids coming out of the surgical field.
The most prevalent micro-organisms isolated were E
coli and Enterococcus fecalis, whilst other studies showed
that Staphylococcus aureus was the most common
isolated bacteria from different wound types [33, 34]. A
recent meta-analysis found that 30.6% of SSI cases in
Ethiopia were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which
was like other reports from India, Nigeria, and Uganda
[35]. Also, Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly iso￾lated in infected wounds following surgeries and burns,
whereas Enterobacteriaceae are commonly isolated from
wounds in immune compromised patients and abdom￾inal surgeries [33, 34]. These virulent isolated microor￾ganisms need to be put in high consideration and
further elaboration to be done regarding this issue.

Conclusion
The results showed a high prevalence of SSI among
patients attending the gastrointestinal tract surgical unit
and it was associated with the malignant diseases, intra￾operative blood loss, intra-operative hypotension, presence
of surgical drains, and long operative duration. The most
prevalent microorganisms isolated were E coli, Entero￾coccus fecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Measures
should be taken to decrease intra-operative blood loss, re￾duce the waste of time due to any cause intra-operatively
so as to reduce the overall duration of operation.
