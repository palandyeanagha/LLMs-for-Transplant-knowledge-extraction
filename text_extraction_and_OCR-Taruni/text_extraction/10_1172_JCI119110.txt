Abstract
The administration of the immunosuppressive humanized
monoclonal antibody CAMPATH 1-H, which recognizes
CD52 on lymphocytes and monocytes, is associated with a
first-dose cytokine-release syndrome involving TNFa, IFNg,
and IL-6 clinically. In vitro models have been used to estab￾lish the cellular source and mechanism responsible for
cytokine release, demonstrating that cytokine release is iso￾type dependent, with the rat IgG2b and human IgG1 iso￾type inducing the highest levels of cytokine release, which
was inhibited with antibody to CD16, the low affinity Fc￾receptor for IgG (FcgR). Cross-linking antibody opsonized
CD4 T lymphocytes failed to stimulate TNFa release, which
together with the observation that TNFa release by purified
natural killer (NK) cells stimulated by fixed autologous
CAMPATH 1-H-opsonized targets was inhibited with anti￾CD16, indicates that cytokine release results from ligation
of CD16 on the NK cells, rather than Fc-receptor (FcR)-
dependent cross-linking of CD52 on the targeted cell. Since
the hierarchy of isotypes inducing cytokine release in these
cultures matches that seen clinically, we conclude that liga￾tion of CD16 on NK cells is also responsible for cytokine re￾lease after injection of CAMPATH 1-H in vivo. (J. Clin. In￾vest. 1996. 98:2819–2826.) Key words: Fc receptor •

Introduction
CAMPATH 1-H is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody
which recognizes the abundant glycolipid anchored CD52 anti￾gen on lymphocytes and monocytes (1). After its infusion, lym￾phocyte and monocytes counts fall rapidly over the first hour,
and a prolonged period of lymphopenia ensues for over 2 yr.
CAMPATH 1-H has been extensively used for the serother￾apy of leukemias and lymphomas because of its ability to de￾bulk circulating tumor cells (2, 3), and to prevent renal al￾lograft rejection (4). Recently CAMPATH 1-H has also found
use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheu￾matoid arthritis (5) and vasculitis (6, 7).
We have administered CAMPATH 1-H to a small group of
multiple sclerosis patients, where it was shown to reduce the
rate of new lesion formation and stabilize disease for between
2–4 yr (8) and unpublished observations. Shortly after anti￾body infusion the patients displayed a reversible exacerbation
of existing neurological symptoms and activation of certain
asymptomatic lesions (9), which was associated with elevated
serum levels of TNFa and IFNg, shortly followed by IL-6. Cy￾tokine release is also obseved after the first dose of CAM￾PATH 1-H in other clinical settings (Isaacs, J., P. Rebello, and
N. Rapson, personal communication), but without the neuro￾logical side effects, indicating that the more severe side effects
seen in the MS patients are dependent on a demyelinating lesion.
Given the encouraging medium term benefit of this treatment
to MS patients in terms of reduced disease activity, we have used
in vitro models to study the stimulus responsible for the release
and cellular source of these cytokines after antibody infusion,
which could include complement intermediates C3a and C5a
(11, 12), engagement of Fc-receptor for IgG (FcgR)1
 (13–15),
or ligation of CD52 (16) on different leukocyte populations.
Methods
Antibodies. An anti-CD32 Fab fragment (clone number: IV.3) was
purchased from Medarex, (West Lebanon, NH) and MOPC21 from
Serotech (Oxford, UK). CAMPATH 1-M and 1-G are rat anti–
human CD52 monoclonal antibodies of the IgM and IgG2b isotype,
respectively. CAMPATH 1-G was used to produce the humanized
IgG1 antibody CAMPATH 1-H by CDR grafting (10). The rat anti–
human CD4 antibody was also humanized using the same human
IgG1 framework as CAMPATH 1-H. The therapeutic grade antibod￾ies were made in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified on protein
A. The proposed sites for C1q or CD64 interaction on the CH2 re￾gion of CAMPATH 1-H were inactivated by site directed mutagene￾sis (17). Human IgG was purified from serum on a PROSEPR-A col￾umn (Bioprocessing LTD., Co., Durham, UK) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Murine monoclonal antibodies were pu￾rified from 50% NH4SO4
 cuts on a PROSEPR-A column. Antibodies
were biotinylated using NHS-biotin (Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford,
IL), removing free biotin by dialysis against PBS 1 10 mM NaAzide.
Antibody Fab fragments were made by reducing pepsin-derived
F(ab9)2
 fragments with DTT, followed by alkylation with iodoacet￾amide, then dialysis against PBS. All the antibodies were passed over
a Detoxi-GelTM (Pierce) column according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions to ensure they were free of endotoxin, which was con￾firmed using the Limulus crab ameobocyte lysate assay (BioWhit￾taker, Walkersville, MD).

Ex vivo whole blood assays. 0.5-ml cultures of heparinized blood
were incubated with antibodies to CD52, CD4, or human IgG at a fi￾nal concentration of 10 mg/ml for up to 6 h at 378C. The cells and
plasma were then separated by centrifugation and the concentration
of cytokines in the plasma was determined as described below.
Separation of cell populations. Mononuclear cells were obtained
after centrifugation over Lymphoprep (Nycomed LTD., Birming￾ham, UK) and the lymphocytes purified from the monocytes by al￾lowing the latter to adhere to plastic flasks for 1 h, after which the
nonadherent lymphocytes were pipetted from the flasks. Alterna￾tively the monocytes were purified from mononuclear cell prepara￾tions by adherence to 24-costar wells at 378C for 1 h, after which the
nonadherent lymphocytes were vigorously washed off the plates.
Granulocytes were prepared by flash lysing the pellet which passed
through the Lymphoprep, then readjusting the osmolarity with 3 10
PBS, before resuspending the cells in RPMI 1 10% FCS. T lympho￾cyte and natural killer (NK) cells were enriched by incubating the
mononuclear cells on 0.5-g nylon wool columns in RPMI 1 10% FCS
for 1 h at 378C. The nonadherent cells were eluted from the column
with warm RPMI 1 10% FCS, washed, and resuspended in fresh me￾dium. In some experiments, these cells were stained with anti￾CD3FITC (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO), then sorted in sterile
PBS by flow cytometry into the CD32 NK fraction and CD31 T lym￾phocyte fraction. CD4 lymphocytes were purified from nylon wool
nonadherent mononuclear cells by incubation with 10 mg/ml anti￾CD4 microbeads (Eurogenetics UK Ltd) washing, then pipetting
them onto a MiniMacs Separation Column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany). Bound CD4 positive cells were recovered after
removal of the column from the separation unit.
Flow cytometry. The cell preparations were analyzed by flow cy￾tometry, using combinations of anti-CD45PE and anti-CD14FITC or
anti-CD19PE and anti-CD2FITC (Eurogenetics), and anti-CD56 (Euro￾genetics) plus polyclonal anti-mouse IgG1FITC (Caltag Labs., South
San Francisco, CA). Nonspecific binding was determined using iso￾type matched irrelevant controls conjugated with PE (Sigma Chem.
Co., St. Louis, MO) or FITC (Caltag). Antibodies to CD2PE (Sero￾tech), CD3FITC (Sigma), and CD16Biotin plus StrepavidinTricolour (Cal￾tag) were used for three-color analysis. 1 3 105
 cells were incubated
with PBS 1 10 mM NaAzide 1 5% heat-inactivated mouse serum for
30 min on ice, then the cells washed and incubated with primary anti￾bodies for 1 h on ice in PBS 1 10 mM NaAzide 1 1% BSA (PBA).
The cells were washed three times, and incubated with the secondary
reagents where appropriate for 30 min on ice in PBA. The cells were
washed once, fixed with 100 ml of 1% formaldehyde in PBS, and ana￾lyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan® interfaced with a Hewlett
Packard 310 computer using FACSmate® and Lysis II software. A
FACSmate was used for automated data acquisition. A live FCS/SSC
gate was set for data acquisition which included all peripheral blood
leukocyte populations, 10,000 events being collected.
Leukocyte cultures. 1 3 106
 purified lymphocytes, monocytes,
granulocytes, or monocytes and lymphocytes were incubated at 378C
in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1 10% FCS in a 24-well plate, either with 10 mg/ml
anti-CD4, CD52, 10 nM PMA (Sigma) plus 1 mg/ml A23187 (Sigma),
or 1 mg/ml LPS (Sigma). After 4 h, the cell-free supernatants were
tested for TNFa or IFNg as described below. In some experiments
Fab fragments of neutralizing antibodies to CD16, 32, 11a or 11b
were added to the cells for 30 min on ice at a final concentration of 10
mg/ml before their stimulation with CAMPATH 1-H as above. Alter￾natively nylon-wool nonadherent mononuclear cells were opsonized
with or without 10 mg/ml CAMPATH 1-H for 1 h on ice in RPMI 1
10% FCS. The targets were washed, fixed with freshly made PBS 1
0.25% paraformaldehyde and left on ice for 1 h, before washing in
PBS 1 10% FCS, and adjusted to the required cell concentration in
RPMI 1 10% FCS. 1 3 106
 unfixed nylon-wool nonadherent cells or
4 3 105
 NK cells or T lymphocytes, which had been pretreated for 30
min on ice with or without 10 mg/ml anti-CD16 (Fab), were incubated
at 378C with an equal number of fixed targets for 4 h then the super￾natants tested for TNFa as below.
Cytokine assays. Plasma TNFa and IFNg were measured using a
sandwich ELISA sensitive to 4.4 pg/ml (R&D Systems, Abingdon,
UK), and an IRMA sensitive to 0.1 NIH U/ml (Centocor, Malvern,
PA), respectively. An in-house ELISA (sensitivity 10 pg/ml IFNg),
was used to assay culture supernatants for IFNg, using a capture
monoclonal antibody (ECACC number 92030610), which was devel￾oped with a polyclonal rabbit anti–human IFNg (Genzyme Corp.,
Cambridge, MA). Plasma IL-6 was measured by proliferation of the
IL-6-dependent B-lymphocyte cell line MH60, as previously de￾scribed (9), in comparison to recombinant human IL-6 (R&D Sys￾tems), and confirming specificity with a neutralizing antiserum to IL-6
(R&D Systems). The concentration of TNFa in tissue culture super￾natants was determined as previously described (18) using the TNF
sensitive L929 bioassay by comparison to a standard curve generated
using recombinant human TNFa (R&D Systems) and the specificity
confirmed using 10% hybridoma supernatant which neutralizes
TNFa (ECACC number 92030602).
The data presented in the figures were derived from a single rep￾resentative experiment which was repeated at least twice, and while
the absolute levels of cytokine measured varied between experi￾ments, the same trend was always observed. Cytokine measurements
were determined over the linear range of the standard curves.
Results
Cytokine release is dependent on antibody specificity as well as
isotype. Ex vivo whole blood cultures were incubated with rat
or humanized monoclonal antibodies to CD52. TNFa, IFNg
could be detected 2 h after the addition of CAMPATH 1-G,
the rat IgG2b or CAMPATH 1-H, its humanized IgG1 deriva￾tive (Fig. 1, a and b). 2–3.8 ng/ml of plasma IL-6 was observed
after incubation with CAMPATH 1-G or 1-H for 4 h, at all
other time points the concentration of IL-6 was below detec￾tion. The rat IgM or humanized IgG4 antibody failed to stimu￾late cytokine release. The kinetics of cytokine release was sim￾ilar to that seen in vivo (9), with TNFa and IFNg detected as
early as 2 h after incubation with the therapeutic antibodies,
IL-6 in contrast, was not detected until 4 h. Despite being the
same isotype as CAMPATH 1-H, the humanized antibody
recognizing CD4 failed to stimulate cytokine release, thus both
the specificity and isotype of the antibody are important in de￾termining cytokine release. The importance of the Fc region
was further emphasized by the inability of a F(ab9)2
 fragment
of CAMPATH 1-H to stimulate cytokine release in the ex vivo
cultures (Fig. 1 c).
Cytokine release is not a consequence of complement activa￾tion. Mutation of CAMPATH 1-H which prevented activa￾tion of the classical pathway of complement were still able to
stimulate TNFa release (Fig. 2). Indeed, in all the individuals
tested, the IgG1 C1q2 mutant induced higher levels of cyto￾kine release than the wild-type antibody. One explanation for
this may be that the fixation of complement intermediates on
the constant region of the complement-fixing antibodies either
interferes with Fc/FcR interactions or there is competition be￾tween complement receptors and FcRs. In contrast, using the
CAMPATH 1-H Fc2 mutant, the level of TNFa release was
reduced by 40–50% compared to the parental antibody in two
of the three individuals. These results confirmed that comple￾ment intermediates were unlikely to be responsible for cyto￾kine release, consistent with the inability of the complement
fixing IgM antibody to stimulate cytokines release. While the
pattern of TNFa release was similar for the three normal indi￾viduals tested, i.e., the IgG4 antibody induced modest TNFa

release compared with the humanized IgG1 antibody and its
derived mutants, the absolute concentration of cytokine re￾lease varied both between and within individuals. The mean
interindividual and intraindividual variation in the level of
TNFa release in response to 10 mg/ml CAMPATH 1-H in
these assays was 210 pg/ml (range 79–545 pg/ml, n 5 8), and
160 pg/ml (range 55–380 pg/ml, n 5 8), respectively. The in￾traindividual assays were conducted over a 2-yr time period.
As a typical responder, MW was used as a source of cells for
subsequent assays.
Nonadherent mononuclear cells are responsible for TNFa
and IFNg release. To determine which population(s) of cells
in the whole blood cultures are responsible for cytokine re￾lease, lymphocytes (plastic nonadherent mononuclear cells),
monocytes (adherent mononuclear cells) and granulocytes
were incubated with CAMPATH 1-H or a positive control for
4 h and the presence of TNFa in the supernatants determined
using the L929 bioassay. Although the positive controls re￾sulted in good TNFa release from the lymphocyte and mono￾cyte populations, TNFa was not detected in the granulocyte
cultures in response to PMA and the calcium ionophore
A23187 (Fig. 3 a). The supernatants from the control and acti￾vated granulocytes contained 4 and 36.5 mg/ml lactoferrin, re￾spectively, indicating elevated secondary granule release after
activation and hence functional activity of these cells. The only
cell population which secreted TNFa in response to CAM￾PATH 1-H was the nonadherent lymphocytes, which produced
z 20% of the TNFa seen with the positive control, suggesting
that a subpopulation of the lymphocytes was responding to
Figure 1. Ex vivo whole blood cultures were incubated for up to 6 h

CAMPATH 1-H stimulation. To establish if cytokine release
was due to contaminating monocytes binding to opsonized
lymphocytes, lymphocytes were added to the monocyte cul￾tures and stimulated as before. TNFa was only observed in the
lymphocyte or lymphocyte plus monocyte cocultures (Fig. 3
b). Since there was not an increase in the level of TNFa de￾tected in the cocultures compared to the lymphocyte cultures,
it seems unlikely that the TNFa was derived from contaminat￾ing monocytes. Culture supernatants of nonadherent mononu￾clear cells stimulated with or without CAMPATH 1-H for 4 h
were tested for IFNg, which revealed 5.6 ng and less than 0.01
ng/ml, respectively, demonstrating that the IFNg and TNFa
producing cells both resided within the nylon-wool nonadher￾ent mononuclear cells.
Involvement of CD16 (FcgRIII) and CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1)
in antibody-dependent TNFa release by nylon-wool nonadher￾ent cells. The nylon-wool nonadherent mononuclear cells
were typically . 95% CD21451 lymphocytes, being largely
depleted of B lymphocytes (, 1% CD191) and monocytes
(, 1% CD141451). These cells responded to the different an￾tibodies in the same way as the cells in the whole blood assays,
i.e., the rat IgG2b and the humanized IgG1 anti-CD52 stimu￾lated TNFa release, while the IgM, IgG1 F(ab9)2
, humanized
IgG1 anti-CD4 and polyclonal human IgG did not (data not
shown). While prior incubation with a Fab to CD32 failed to
inhibit CAMPATH 1-H-dependent TNFa release in nylon￾wool nonadherent mononuclear cell cultures, the anti-CD16
fragment was able to inhibit cytokine release by 85% (78–
97%, n 5 4) (Fig. 4 a). Fab fragments of an anti-CD11a, but
not CD11b, were also able to inhibit 74% (70–78%, n 5 2) of
the CAMPATH 1-H mediated TNFa release by the nylon￾wool nonadherent cells (Fig. 4 b).
Ligation of CD16 not CD52 results in cytokine release by
NK cells. CD41 lymphocytes were purified from nylon-wool
nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a su￾perparamagnetic anti-CD4. The cells were incubated for 4 h
with 10 mg/ml CAMPATH 1-H with or without a cross-linking
second antibody. In contrast to stimulation with PMA plus the
calcium ionophore A23187, ligation of CD52 by CAMPATH
1-H failed to stimulate TNFa release (Fig. 5). Nylon-wool non￾adherent mononuclear cells were incubated in medium with or
without 10 mg/ml CAMPATH 1-H, washed, then fixed with
paraformaldehyde. Incubation of fresh nonadherent mononu￾clear cells with fixed opsonized, but not control cells resulted
in TNFa release which could be inhibited with a neutralizing
Fab anti-CD16 (Fig. 6 a). This experiment was repeated with T
lymphocytes (99.3% CD31) or NK cells (0.2% CD31, 80%
CD161) which had been sorted by flow cytometry, revealing
that NK cells were responsible for the observed CD16-depen￾dent TNFa release (Fig. 6 b). In contrast no TNFa could be
detected when the T lymphocytes were stimulated with anti￾body opsonized targets, however their capacity to secrete TNFa
was demonstated after stimulation with PMA and calcium
ionophore. To exclude the possibility that cytokine release was
being released by CD161 cells other than NK cells, nylon-wool
nonadherent mononuclear cells were stained with anti-CD3FITC
,
anti-CD2PE, and anti-CD16Biotin, followed by streptavidinTricolour
.
The CD213
1 positive T lymphocytes were distinguished from
the CD21CD32 NK cells, demonstrating that CD16 expression
was confined to the NK cells (data not shown). This together
with the data shown in Fig. 6 b, confirms that NK cells were the
source of cytokine release. The number of CD21CD32CD161
cells (10.5%) was in good agreement with the number of
CD561 NK cells (13.2%), since it is known that between 80–
90% of human NK cells express CD16 (19).
Discussion
The availability of monoclonal antibodies able to specifically
target and deplete cell populations in vivo has had a significant
impact in the fields of oncology, transplantation, and more re￾cently in the management of autoimmune disease. However
monoclonal antibodies in addition to binding antigen, possess
additional biological activities through the interaction of the
Fc region of the molecule with the complement system and
FcRs, properties that are not necessarily beneficial when used
clinically. CAMPATH 1-H, like the immunosuppressive ro￾dent monoclonal antibody OKT3, is associated with the se￾quential release of TNFa and IFNg followed by IL-6, 2–4 h
after infusion of the first dose of antibody, which can be inhib￾Figure 3. Cultures of (a) 1 3 106
 lymphocytes (LYMPH), monocytes 
(MONO) or granulocytes (GRAN), or (b) lymphocytes and mono￾cytes were prepared by differential adhesion of mononuclear cells to 
plastic or flash lysis of cells passing through Lymphoprep. The cells 
were incubated in 0.5 ml RPMI 1 10% FCS with 10 nM PMA plus
1 mM A23187, 1 mg/ml LPS, or 10 mg/ml CAMPATH 1-H. The cell￾free supernatants were harvested after 4 h and TNFa measured using 
the L929 bioassay in conjunction with a neutralizing mAb to TNFa to 
confirm specificity.

Mechanism of First-Dose Cytokine-Release Syndrome by CAMPATH 1-H 2823
ited by the administration of methylprednisolone immediately
before antibody infusion (9, 20). Since steroids are known to
inhibit cytokine synthesis at the level of transcription and
translation (21–23), this together with their sequential release,
implies that they are de novo synthesized in a coordinated re￾sponse.
We initially chose ex vivo whole blood cultures as a model
to study cytokine release after therapeutic antibody adminis￾tration because it reproduced as far as possible the cellular
composition which these antibodies would encounter immedi￾ately after infusion. We believe both the ex vivo whole blood
and nonadherent mononuclear cell cultures are good models
since the hierarchy of antibody isotypes which initiate a first
dose response clinically, CD52 hIgG1 5 rIgG2b . hIgG4 .
hCD4 IgG1 (24), is preserved in vitro. Furthermore using clin￾ically relevant concentrations of therapeutic antibody in vitro,
the kinetics of cytokine release was similar to that seen with
the use of CAMPATH 1-H in multiple sclerosis (9), rheuma￾toid arthritis, transplant recipients, and patients undergoing
cancer serotherapy (Isaacs, J., P. Rebello, and N. Rapson, per￾sonal communication). Cytokine release was not due to endo￾toxin contamination since addition of polymyxin B, an antibi￾otic able to neutralize the biological properties of LPS (25, 26)
did not reduce CAMPATH 1-H induced TNFa release in the
whole blood cultures (24). The reason for the modest cytokine
release induced by the humanized IgG1 anti-CD4 antibody,
despite having an isotype capable of ligating FcgRs is unclear,
however since there is z 20 times more CD52 expressed per
cell than CD4, antigen density may play a role in cytokine re￾lease. This is supported by the observation that the ability of
rat IgG2b or human IgG1 antibodies to lymphocyte surface
antigens to induce cytokine release in whole blood cultures is
in approximate relationship to their cell surface expression
(24). An additional variable that could critically determine the
extent of cytokine release is the accessibility of the antibody Fc
region to FcRs after antigen binding. Thus the combination of
antigen specificity and antibody isotype may both be impor￾tant in FcR-dependent cytokine release.
OKT3, which binds to CD3 on T lymphocytes, has been ex￾tensively used to prevent graft rejection as well as graft versus
host disease (27, 28). Though still controversial, it is thought
that the cytokine release associated with OKT3 results from
the transient activation of T lymphocytes after FcR-dependent
CD3 cross-linking (29–32). Like OKT3, the involvement of
FcgRs in CAMPATH 1-H-mediated cytokine release was also
demonstrated by the 40–50% reduction in TNFa release in
two individuals using the IgG1 Fc2 mutant, in which the IgG1
CH2 hinge-link sequence had been mutated to FcR non-bind￾ing IgG2 sequence (17). Since it is believed that there is some
overlap in the site on the antibody for interaction with both the
high- and low-affinity CD64 and CD16 FcgRI and III, respec￾tively (33, 34), it is likely that mutations designed to inhibit
CD64 interactions may to some extent also affect CD16. How￾ever the ability of an antibody to CD16 to inhibit cytokine re￾lease confirmed the involvement of this receptor. The failure
to inhibit cytokine release using the IgG1 Fc2 antibody in one
of the individuals was consistent with their ability to mediate
ADCC reactions using different isotypes of CAMPATH 1-H
(17). Since the cytokine release induced by CAMPATH 1-H
opsonized cells is CD16-dependent, this indicates that the
stimulus for cytokine release is mediated by CD16 rather than
CD52. Thus in contrast to OKT3, which transiently activates T
lymphocytes through the antibody Fab, CAMPATH 1-H in￾duced cytokine release appears to be a consequence of ligation
of CD16 on NK cells. Because previous studies have demon￾strated that removal of CD561 NK cells, but not CD141 mono￾cytes abolishes the ability to mediate autologous antibody de￾pendent cell cytotoxicity in vitro using CAMPATH 1-H (Tite,
J., personal communication), it appears that in addition to
playing a role in lymphocyte cytotoxicity, NK cells are also re￾sponsible for the first dose response via the secretion of cyto￾kines. That the cytokine producing cells only represented 13%
of the nonadherent mononuclear cell cultures was consistent
with the observation that CAMPATH 1-H–induced TNFa re￾lease was only a fraction of the total inducible by a nonspecific
stimulus such as PMA and the calcium ionophore A23187.
While modest levels of IL-6 were detected in the whole blood
cultures, this cytokine was below the limits of detection in
nonadherent mononuclear cell cultures stimulated with CAM￾PATH 1-H (data not shown). The delay in the appearance of

 nylon wool 
nonadherent lymphocytes were 
preincubated with or without 
Fab fragments of neutralizing 
antibodies to (a) CD32 or CD16 
and (b) CD16, CD11a or 
CD11b for 30 min on ice before 
incubation with 10 mg/ml CAM￾PATH 1-H for 4 h at 378C in 
RPMI 1 10% FCS. The con￾centration of TNFa in the cell￾free supernatants was then 
measured using the L929 bioas￾say in conjunction with a neu￾tralizing mAb to TNFa to con￾firm specificity.

2824 Wing et al.
IL-6 compared to TNFa and IFNg after administration of
CAMPATH 1-H in vivo (9 and Rapson, N., personal commu￾nication), suggests that IL-6 may be released from other cell(s)
in response to the above cytokines, which in vivo could include
monocytes (35, 36) and endothelial cells (37).
In spite of its abundance on the surface of lymphocytes and
monocytes, a physiological role for CD52 has yet to be found,
though recently it has been demonstrated by Rowan et al. (16)
that CAMPATH 1-H plus cross-linking second antibodies are
mitogenic only in the presence of sub-optimal concentrations
of PMA, in highly purified CD4 and CD8 cultures which had
been exhaustively depleted of CD161 NK cells. While modest
levels of TNFa and IFNg were detected in these cultures, they
were not apparent until 96 h of culture, indicating that the
acute release of these cytokines seen clinically and in vitro in
our study within 2–4 h of stimulation with CAMPATH 1-H,
are derived from a different cellular source to that described
by Rowan et al. (16). In contrast to the lack of evidence for
acute cytokine release being mediated after ligation of CD52,
IFNg, and TNFa mRNA was detected within 2 h of cross-link￾ing CD16 on NK cells, which was followed shortly by cytokine
secretion (13). CD16 on NK cells consists of a noncovalent
complex with at least two additional proteins; the T lympho￾cyte receptor z chain (38) and FceR1 g chain (39), which by
analogy to the signal transduction pathways described after T
lymphocyte activation through the CD3 z chain dimers (40),
may ultimately result in cytokine transcription by NK cells.
The ability of a Fab fragment of an antibody to CD11a
(LFA-1) to also inhibit TNFa secretion following CAMPATH
1-H stimulation is not without precedent, because this mole￾cule, which is constitutively expressed at high levels by NK
cells (41), has been shown to be important in promoting effec￾tor–target interactions by these cells (42). Furthermore it has
been demonstrated that some antibodies to CD11a are able to
synergize with CD16 in the acute release of TNFa by NK cells
(43). Because there was little evidence of cytokine release in
the absence of CD16 ligation, this argues that the involvement
of LFA-1 is secondary to CD16 ligation. Thus while it is proba￾ble that CAMPATH 1-H is responsible for establishing the ini￾tial bridge between CD52 on the antibody-coated targets and
CD16 on the NK cells, other molecules such as CD11a on the
NK cell and its ligand ICAM, may subsequently contribute to
this interaction.
In conclusion, we feel that the chain of events initiated af￾ter injection of CAMPATH 1-H resulting in a cytokine-related
first dose response, is a consequence of antibody-coated tar￾Figure 6. (a) 1 3 106

 flow cytometry purified NK cells or T lymphocytes were 
incubated either alone (CONT), with 10 mg/ml CAMPATH 1-H 
(CP1-H), or alternatively with (1) or without (2) a Fab fragment of 
a neutralizing mAb to CD16 before the addition of an equal number 
of nylon wool nonadherent cells which had been fixed with parafor￾maldehyde (FIXED) after incubation with CAMPATH 1-H (1H) or 
without (C).The concentration of TNFa in the cell-free supernatants 
was measured after 4 h using the L929 bioassay in conjunction with a 
neutralizing mAb to TNFa to confirm specificity.

CAMPATH 1-H plus or minus a rabbit anti–human IgG second anti￾body. The concentration of TNFa in the cell-free supernatants was 
then measured using the L929 bioassay in conjunction with a neutral￾izing mAb to TNFa to confirm specificity.

Mechanism of First-Dose Cytokine-Release Syndrome by CAMPATH 1-H 2825
gets interacting with CD161 NK cells. Because the rapid and
profound lymphopenia that results from the injection of this
antibody appears to be dependent on FcgR positive cells (3),
engineering-out FcR interactions by site-directed mutagenesis
to reduce the side effects may create an antibody which is less
efficient at lymphocyte depletion. Since we have previously
demonstrated that pretreatment of the patients with a single
dose of methylprednisolone before the start of antibody infu￾sion largely prevented the side effects, without obviously af￾fecting the rate or length of lymphocyte depletion (9), this may
represent a better approach for the management of patients
receiving this form of immunosuppressive treatment.
