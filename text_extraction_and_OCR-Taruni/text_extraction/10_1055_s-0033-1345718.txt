It is estimated that two billion people worldwide have been
infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with more than
350 million with chronic infection.1 Those with chronic
hepatitis B (CHB) have up to a 15 to 40% risk of developing
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in their lifetime. In
Africa and Asia, 8 to 10% of the adult population is chronically
infected with HBV, most having been infected during child￾hood. Up to 50% of new cases of HBV infection are due to
vertical transmission.2 In countries of low endemicity defined
by HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence < 2%, such as the
United States and northern or western Europe, the majority of
new infections occur among adolescents and adults. These
infections are attributable to high-risk sexual activity and
injection-drug-use exposures.3 However, with immigration
of individuals from high-risk geographic areas into areas of
low risk, prevalence of HBV infection is expected to increase
in low prevalence countries, particularly among certain for￾eign-born groups.
Current indications for the treatment of CHB are based on
the disease stage determined by HBV DNA level, serologic
status, and evidence of liver injury.4,5 Most patients receive
treatment because they are in the immune-active phase, have
advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, or have multiple risk factors for
liver cancer.4–6 The current therapeutic armamentarium for
CHB involves oral nucleos(t)ide analogues and pegylated
interferon (PEG IFN). Only tenofovir (TDF) and entecavir
(ETV) are recommended as first-line oral antiviral therapies.
Lamivudine (LAM) and telbivudine (LdT), despite their safety
profiles, have high rates of resistance that can result in cross
resistance with other oral therapies. Adefovir (ADF) has only
moderate antiviral activity with increased rates of resistance
and nephrotoxicity with long-term use.

Abstract The management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) during pregnancy remains a challenge
and involves various aspects of maternal–fetal care. Despite the standard immunopro￾phylaxis, a significant portion of infants born to highly viremic mothers remain infected
with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Emerging data suggest that antiviral therapy in the third
trimester can prevent immunoprophylaxis failure. To minimize fetal exposure to antiviral
agents, antiviral therapy during pregnancy should be reserved for mothers with
advanced disease or who are at risk for hepatic decompensation. Current safety data
suggest that lamivudine, telbivudine, or tenofovir may be used during pregnancy.
However, the timing in initiating antiviral therapy requires careful assessment of risks
and benefit. The authors provide a systematic review of the features of HBV during
pregnancy, risk factors for vertical transmission, and evidence-based data on antiviral
use during pregnancy. They propose an algorithm to assess the need of antiviral
treatment and monitor mothers with CHB.

The management of CHB during pregnancy remains a
challenge with unique issues that involve various aspects of
care for both the mother and fetus. Special considerations
include the effect of HBV on maternal and fetal health, effects
of pregnancy on the course of HBV infection, antiviral treat￾ment during pregnancy for maternal liver disease, and the
prevention of perinatal transmission. Here we provide a
systematic review on these issues with a focus on the safety
and potential benefit of antiviral therapy during pregnancy.
Maternal and Fetal–Neonatal Outcomes
The impact of CHB on pregnancy outcomes has not been
clearly defined. Most published data have suggested that CHB
negatively impacts maternal outcomes. Possible associations
have been described between CHB and gestational diabetes
mellitus,7–9 antepartum hemorrhage,9 increased risk of pre￾maturity,10 and lower birth weight.11 A retrospective study
by Lao et al reported that a significantly higher prevalence of
gestational diabetes mellitus was found in mothers with
HBsAg positivity (n ¼ 1138) when compared with those
(n ¼ 12,547) without CHB.7 In a case-control retrospective
study by Tse et al, HBsAg positive mothers (n ¼ 253) were
compared with HBsAg negative mothers (n ¼ 253), matched
by age, parity, and year of delivery. They observed that
maternal HBsAg positivity was associated with increased
antepartum hemorrhage, gestational diabetes, and threat￾ened preterm labor.9
Data are conflicting regarding fetal outcomes from mater￾nal CHB infection. Recent studies suggest that maternal CHB
infection was associated with preterm labor, perinatal mor￾tality, congenital malformations, and low birth weight.10,11
Conversely, one large retrospective study compared 824
HBsAg-positive mothers to 6281 HBsAg-negative controls.
No differences were seen in gestational age at delivery, birth
weight, neonatal jaundice, congenital anomalies, incidence of
prematurity, or perinatal mortality.12 Other studies have
shown that the strength of these associations is still un￾clear.13,14 A significant adverse neonatal outcome is the
development of fulminant hepatitis in some newborns
when HBV is transmitted from HBeAg-negative mothers.15
The impact of CHB on the infant’s outcome is further dis￾cussed in the Mother-to-Child Transmission of HBV section.
Effect of Pregnancy on CHB Infection
Women with CHB infection generally do well during preg￾nancy. Pregnancy is a hormone-induced immune-tolerant
state and is associated with high levels of adrenal cortico￾steroids with modulation of cytokines in the immune re￾sponse. Studies have shown that although no significant
difference was seen in viral levels during pregnancy, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) had a tendency to increase late in
pregnancy and postpartum.16,17 With the expected but sud￾den decrease in levels of corticosteroids during the postpar￾tum period, this may create a setting comparable to the acute
withdrawal of steroids that can result in hepatitis flares.18–20
As a result, mild elevation in ALT levels is not uncommon and
usually well tolerated, but severe flares (ALT > 5  baseline
value or 10 upper limit of normal [ULN]) can occur during
the first few months after delivery.18,19 Some studies have
shown that postpartum flares can lead to HBV e antigen
(HBeAg) seroconversion ranging from 12 to 17%.20 Severe
exacerbation of the disease leading to decompensation has
been reported, but is very rare.21 Ter Borg et al reported that
the administration of lamivudine during third trimester did
not prevent flares.19 However, factors such as maternal age,
parity, and precore or basal-core promoter mutations do not
appear to be associated with postpartum HBeAg clear￾ance.20,22 There is limited understanding of the natural
history of HBV during pregnancy. Thus, mothers with CHB
should be monitored closely for hepatitis flare and exacerba￾tion during the postpartum period.
Mother-to-Child Transmission of HBV
The implementation of universal maternal screening pro￾grams and passive–active immunoprophylaxis of infants has
reduced mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rates to 5 to
10%. However, up to 30% of infants born to highly viremic
mothers may fail immunoprophylaxis.23 Recent studies
demonstrated that the serum level of maternal HBV DNA is
an independent risk factor for immunoprophylaxis fail￾ure.24–26 Although Xu et al suggested that maternal HBeAg
positivity was an independent risk factor for immunopro￾phylaxis failure,25 this finding has not been confirmed by
others. In addition, mothers who are HBeAg-negative, but
with a high level of HBV DNA, have shown increased risk in
HBV transmission to the infant during birth.27 Wiseman et al
evaluated 138 babies born to HBsAg-positive mothers.26
Forty-seven women in the study were HBeAg-positive with
viral levels > 8 log10 copies/mL, and 9% (4 of 47) of their
infants failed immunoprophylaxis in a 9-month follow-up,
compared with none of the infants when maternal HBV DNA
was  8 log10 copies/mL; however, these findings were
based only on a few cases with immunoprophylaxis failure.
Transmission risk with maternal HBV DNA levels between 6
to 8 log10 copies/mL may not have been noted in the
aforementioned studies.
A recent large-scale study evaluating 1,043 mother–infant
pairs by Zou et al demonstrated that there was a linear
correlation between immunoprophylaxis failure rates and
maternal HBV DNA levels.24 Among 869 infants given appro￾priate immunoprophylaxis with serologic testing at age 7 to
12 months, 27 (3.1%) infants had immunoprophylaxis failure.
When maternal predelivery HBV DNA levels were stratified
to < 6 log10 copies/mL, 6 to 6.99 log10 copies/mL, 7 to 7.99
log10 copies/mL, and  8 log10 copies/mL, the corresponding
rates of immunoprophylaxis failure were 0%, 3.2% (3 of 95),
6.7% (19 of 282), and 7.6% (5 of 66), respectively (p < 0.001 for
the trend). The study suggested that maternal HBV DNA
levels > 6 log10 copies/mL reduced prophylaxis effective rate
(PER). In a recently published expert consensus from the First
International Symposium on Hepatitis B Infection in Special
Populations,28 it is recommended that pregnant women with
HBV DNA > 6 log10 copies/mL (> 200,000 IU/mL) at the third

trimester be considered for antiviral prophylaxis for preven￾tion of MTCT.
Concerns of Antiviral Therapy during
Pregnancy
Limited Efficacy on Maternal Disease with Short-Term
Therapy
Most pregnant women with significant viremia have well￾compensated disease. As per current standard of care, pa￾tients in the immune-tolerance phase should be monitored
without treatment.4,5 However, they may receive antiviral
therapy for the prevention of MTCT at the third trimester or
rarely, for the management of maternal disease due to CHB
activation in pregnancy.4,28 Current available data on antivi￾ral therapy during pregnancy are largely from trials evaluat￾ing antiviral-therapy use in the prevention of MTCT.
A recent study of 135 pregnant women who received LdT
starting either at the second (101 of 135) or third trimester
(34 of 135) demonstrated a > 3 log10 copies/mL HBV DNA
reduction, and 33% had HBV DNA < 500 copies/mL at the
time of delivery.29 Eighty-eight mothers who discontinued
LdT treatment at 1-month postpartum had a rise in serum
HBV DNA levels 4 weeks later with levels returning to baseline
prior to the initiation of LdT. None of the treated patients had
sustainable viral suppression. At the time of delivery, 83%
(30 of 36) of patients who had baseline elevation of ALT prior
to pregnancy had normalization of their ALT. The ALT re￾mained within normal limits during treatment. Eighteen of
88 mothers who discontinued LdT at 1 month postpartum
had fluctuation in ALT levels, but only one had ALT > 5 ULN.
However, 13% of 38 mothers who continued on LdT treatment
up to postpartum week 110 had HBeAg seroconversion.
Similar results were observed by Pan et al on 88 mothers
with active CHB who had elevated ALT and HBV DNA > 6
log10 copies/mL.30 Maternal HBsAg loss did not occur in either
trial.
Xu et al reported that mothers treated with LAM at the
third trimester had HBV DNA reduction from baseline of
2,220 (  1,610.9) mEq/mL to 41.7 (  177.4) mEq/mL at
week 4 of therapy and remained suppressed throughout the
treatment period.23 However, HBV DNA levels returned to
baseline in all patients after treatment cessation at week 4
postpartum. For mothers with elevated ALT levels at baseline,
the median level in the LAM-treated group decreased to < 1
ULN by week 4 of treatment and remained within the range of
1.2 ULN during the trial. The above trials showed limited
efficacy on maternal disease because LdT and LAM treatment
were discontinued within a few weeks postpartum.23,29,30 In
addition, more than 70% of patients enrolled were immune
tolerant. Treatment end points for this phase of CHB infection
remain poorly defined by current standard of care.
Safety Concerns on Fetal Exposure to Antiviral
The development of the embryo is at its most critical stage
during the first trimester. It is during organogenesis between
weeks 4 to 14 of gestation that exposure to teratogenic drugs
could result in birth defects. In 1979, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) implemented labeling requirements
and each drug is classified into one of five categories based
on the safety data for pregnancy (►Table 1). All HBV antiviral
drugs are category C, except for tenofovir and telbivudine,
which are category B drugs. However, this system may
oversimplify the clinical complexities that exist when evalu￾ating the risks to the fetus and the benefits of treating
maternal disease. In May 2008, the FDA announced that the
five-category system would be replaced by a narrative frame￾work consisting of three sections with one section on clinical
consideration of addressing risk assessment after exposure.31
Currently, this new system has not yet been implemented.

Established in 1989, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry
(APR) has been evaluating the teratogenic effects of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents.32 APR data confirmed
that birth defect rates from LAM or TDF exposure were
comparable to those seen in the general population
(►Table 2). The limitations of the APR include underreport￾ing, lack of long-term follow-up of infants, and lack of
confirmation of actual diagnosis of birth defects. In addition,
there are no data on fetal miscarriages or infant developmen￾tal delays that may have occurred later.
Among CHB pregnant mothers enrolled in prospective
trials, fetal abnormalities were extremely low. Xu et al
reported one infant (1 of 89) born to a LAM-treated mother
with atrial septum defect, Ebstein anomaly, and pneumo￾thorax.23 Similar outcomes were observed in prospective
trials on mothers treated with LdT.23,29,30 In a recent large
prospective trial collecting “real-world” data with enroll￾ment of 700 mothers into treatment arms for LdT or LAM
versus no treatment,33 only 0.97% infants had birth defects
in the treatment group compared with 1.7% in the untreated
group (p > 0.05). It is worth noting that all the above trials
provided follow-up on infants with a maximum period of
52 weeks.23,29,30,33 Long-term safety data remain unavail￾able. Other adverse events that have been reported with
nucleos(t)ide analogues use include mitochondrial damage,
lactic acidosis, and acute fatty liver. Although rare, lactic
acidosis is a serious and potentially fatal complication
leading to fetal death even if the mother is able to recover.
The development of fatal lactic acidosis has only been
reported in infants who had exposure to HIV antiviral drugs.
However, this has not been observed in infants born to
mothers on antiviral treatment for HBV.34,35
Based on a recent study from the Medical Research Council
(MRC) clinical trials unit in the United Kingdom, TDF use
during pregnancy did not increase risk for kidney disease,
birth defects, or growth abnormalities in infants born to HIV￾infected women in Africa.36 The majority of mothers were
taking TDF-containing regimens for HIV before and through￾out pregnancy. Among 226 live births, there was no increase
in the proportion of infants who died shortly after birth (3%)
or who had birth defects (3%). The surviving infants were HIV￾negative and had normal growth without renal problems or
bone fractures up to age 4. Similar findings on fetal exposure
to TDF were reported by other studies including 81 infants
observed by Vigano et al37 and 2,029 infants observed by
Siberry et al with 1-year follow-up.38 Currently, under the
Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an ongoing controlled
trial is evaluating renal function and bone loss in pediatric
HBV-infected patients.
Antiviral Therapy for the Reduction
of Immunoprophylaxis Failure
Current immunoprophylaxis is less efficacious in mothers
with high serum levels of HBV DNA > 6 log10 copies/mL or
200,000 IU/mL.24,29,33,39 However, there is growing evidence
that treatment with LAM, LdT, or TDF during the third
trimester may reduce the risk of transmission by lowering
maternal viremia prior to delivery.23,29,33,39,40 There is very
limited data on other antiviral treatments for mothers with
HBV. They will not be discussed in this review.
Treatment with Lamivudine
In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded
study evaluating 115 HBeAg-positive mothers who had HBV
DNA  1,000 mEq/mL ( 8 log10 IU/mL),23 mothers were
randomized to receive LAM (150 mg/d) or placebo starting at
32 weeks of gestation with treatment cessation at 4 weeks
postpartum. Of infants born to mothers who were treated
with lamivudine, 18% (10 of 56) were HBsAg-positive at
52 weeks compared with 39% (25 of 59) infants in the control
group with statistical significance in the intention to treat
analysis. However, there was no difference on MTCT rates
between the treated and placebo group in the sensitivity
analysis. LAM treatment was well tolerated without safety
concerns. It should be noted that results may also have been
affected by a high number of infants who were lost to follow
up, particularly in the control group. A recent study observed
that LAM use in the second or third trimester of pregnancy
has similar efficacy in preventing MTCT in highly viremic
mothers.39 Thus, LAM treatment may be deferred until the
third trimester for high-risk mothers to minimize fetal
exposure and the development of LAM resistance in the
mother.

Treatment with Telbivudine
In a recent study evaluating the efficacy of LdT in preventing
MTCT, LdT (600 mg/d) was administered at the gestational
age of 20 to 32 weeks in women with HBV DNA > 7 log10
copies/mL.29 The baseline characteristics of mothers in the
LdT-treated group (n ¼ 137) and untreated group (n ¼ 97)
were comparable. All infants received appropriate immuno￾prophylaxis. At age 7 months, none of the infants in the
treatment group had positive HBsAg or detectable HBV DNA.
In contrast, 8% (p < 0.01) of infants in the control group (7 of
88) were HBsAg-positive along with detectable HBV DNA.
There was no significant difference in fetal development or
infant outcomes between the two groups in terms of body
weight, height, or Apgar score. Another recent large-scale,
real-world study evaluated highly viremic mothers who had
third-trimester treatment with LdT (n ¼ 252) or LAM
(n ¼ 51) versus no treatment (n ¼ 345).33 Immunoprophy￾laxis failure rates in their paired infants were 1.9%, 3.7% versus
7.6%, respectively (all treated vs. untreated ¼ 2.2% vs. 7.6%,
p ¼ 0.0023). The above trials were nonrandomized studies
with only short-term follow-up. Despite these limitations,
these studies tend to support the use of LdT to reduce MTCT in
highly viremic mothers.
Treatment with Tenofovir
Although TDF has been used in HIV or HIV/ HBV coinfected
mothers, little data exist for mothers with HBV monoinfec￾tion. A recent case series study evaluated HBeAg-positive
mothers with HBV DNA > 7 log10 copies/mL who received
TDF 300 mg/d at the third trimester.40 All infants received
hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the three-series
vaccination. A significant reduction in serum HBV DNA was
achieved at delivery compared with baseline (mean
5.25  1.79 vs. 8.87  0.45 log10 copies/mL, respectively;
p < 0.01). The 11 infants born from mothers who received
TDF had no obstetric complications or birth defects. All
infants were HBsAg-negative at 28 to 36 weeks after birth.
A large prospective randomized control trial studying the
prevention of HBV MTCT with the use of TDF in the third
trimester is currently being conducted in Asia with anticipat￾ed trial results available in 2014.41
Resistance and Hepatitis Flare from Antiviral Therapy
Current available data have shown that antiviral resistance to
LAM or LdT therapy in treatment naïve pregnant mothers are
very uncommon due to the short duration (8–12 wk) of
therapy at the third trimester of pregnancy.23,29,33,40 For
treatment-experienced patients when indicated, initiating
TDF is recommended because of its favorable resistance
profile and high potency in viral suppression. Per the Euro￾pean Association for the Study of the Liver and the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases,4,5 it is considered
one of the first-line therapies in standard treatment. In
addition, switching treatment to TDF is effective in mothers
with nucleoside resistance.6,42 Another concern is antiviral
therapy inducing hepatitis flare, which can occur during
treatment or after cessation of treatment postpartum. Xu et
al reported that when LAM was initiated at the third trimes￾ter,23 ALT elevations occurred in 25% (22 of 89) of mothers
compared with 49% (30 of 61) in the placebo group. After
treatment cessation at week 4 postpartum, ALT elevation
occurred in 19% (16 of 83) of mothers in the LAM group
compared with 33% (15 of 46) in the placebo group. Only one
subject in each group had ALT > 10 ULN following treat￾ment cessation. In a study evaluating 38 CHB mothers either
HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative who received LAM during
the third trimester, postpartum flares (ALT > 3 ULN) were
seen in 62% of LAM treated mothers after treatment cessation,
compared with 42% of untreated mothers.19
Antiviral Therapy for the Management of
Maternal Disease
When pregnant women experience an acute hepatitis flare or
have preexisting severe or advanced liver disease such as
cirrhosis, antiviral therapy may be initiated during pregnancy
or continued if antiviral drug has been started prior to
pregnancy.4,42 The potential safety concerns of fetal exposure
to antiviral agents should not preclude the initiation of thera￾py, which may be potentially lifesaving for both mother and
fetus. Recent studies have described pregnancy as causing
progression of underlying liver disease with a variable presen￾tation ranging from mild hepatitis flare to acute hepatic
decompensation.16,18 For pregnant mothers who have acute
hepatitis flare (ALT > 10 ULN or 5 baseline values) with or
without hepatic decompensation, TDF treatment is preferred
and should be continued throughout the pregnancy. Experi￾ence in nonpregnant patients with acute exacerbation of CHB
suggested that TDF treatment also reduced short-term mor￾tality rates when acute on chronic liver failure developed.43
It is important to identify mothers with cirrhosis who have
high risk for maternal and perinatal complications. In a recent
retrospective study evaluating 399 cirrhotic mothers from
1993 to 2005,44 15% of women in the cirrhotic group had
hepatic decompensation during pregnancy. Maternal and
fetal mortality were higher in the cirrhosis group compared
with the control group, 1.8% versus 0% (p < 0.0001) and 5.2%
versus 2.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. Therefore, it is advised
that antiviral therapy be initiated during pregnancy for
cirrhotic mothers (or continued in cirrhotic patients who
are already on treatment).4 Maternal complications such as
gestational hypertension, placental abruption, and peripar￾tum hemorrhage were increased in the group with cirrhosis
when compared with age-matched controls. Higher rates of
prematurity and growth restriction were seen in the infants
born to mothers with cirrhosis. Thus, close monitoring is
necessary in addition to antiviral treatment.
Discussion and Strategies
With our understanding of the current safety data on HBV
antiviral therapy, there should be a thorough discussion on
indications for antiviral treatment and timing of the initiation
of treatment for women with CHB who are contemplating
pregnancy. For patients who are already on treatment, the
decision to withhold or continue therapy at the time of

conception should also be discussed thoroughly based on the
detailed evaluation of the disease stage and liver histology if
available.
Women with Active CHB
It is recommended that patients in the immune clearance or
reactivation phase be placed on antiviral treatment as per
standard of care.4,5 It appears to be more beneficial if the HBV
DNA can be reduced to undetectable level before conceiving,
particularly as Nie et al observed that a significant percentage
of mothers with HBV viremia had HBV replication in oocytes
and in the embryo.45 For treatment naïve patients who are
planning future pregnancy, it may be worth considering a
finite duration of treatment with PEG IFN to control HBV
viremia with the potential goal of achieving HBeAg loss or
seroconversion prior to pregnancy. Efforts should be made to
prevent pregnancy during IFN therapy and a 6-month wash￾out period after treatment discontinuation. If pregnancy
planning is not feasible, first-line oral antiviral is preferred
to manage maternal disease and suppress viremia. At the time
of conception, antiviral treatment could be withheld in
patients without acute exacerbation of hepatitis or advanced
liver disease. A recent study has demonstrated that there
were no significant adverse events in these mothers who
discontinued treatment.22 In the event of severe hepatitis
flare (ALT > 10 ULN or 5 baseline) or the need to suppress
high-level viremia at the third trimester for the prevention of
MTCT, reinitiation of treatment may be indicated. For moth￾ers with cirrhosis or advanced histology, antiviral therapy
should be continued throughout pregnancy to prevent dis￾ease progression and decompensation. The drug of choice is
TDF, but LdT may be used in countries where TDF is unavail￾able. Close surveillance for antiviral resistance is mandated
after the use of LdT for > 12 weeks.29
Women in the Immune-Tolerance Phase
Women in the immune-tolerance phase who are contemplat￾ing having children should be monitored closely after concep￾tion. Antiviral treatment may be offered at the beginning of the
third trimester for the following conditions28: (1) maternal
HBV-DNA level  6 log10 copies/mL during the late second
trimester, (2) history of a child with previous immunoprophy￾laxis failure, and (3) preterm labor. Monotherapy with LAM,
LdT, or TDF is an acceptable option and treatment can be
discontinued at week 4 postpartum or earlier if breastfeeding
is desired. Close monitoring at 4- to 6-week intervals of viral
levels and liver enzymes for potential off-treatment flare
within 12 weeks of treatment cessation is recommended. If
a severe hepatitis flare occurs (or evidence of immune-clear￾ance phase) during pregnancy, TDF is recommended as first￾line treatment and should be continued through pregnancy
because long-term treatment is anticipated.

Antiviral Therapy in Mothers Anticipating
Breastfeeding
Although HBsAg can be detected in breast milk,46 breastfeed￾ing has not been shown to increase the risk of transmission
compared with bottle feeding. A study evaluating 147 infants
born to HBV-carrier mothers showed no association between
breastfeeding and the development of CHB infection in the
infants.47,48 Neonates who are correctly immunized may be
breastfed.4,5 Breastfeeding can be started as long as the infant
has received HBIG and the first dose of vaccination at birth.
For mothers who remain on antiviral therapy postpartum,
breastfeeding has generally not been recommended.5 Not
much is known regarding the extent of drug exposure to the
infant during breastfeeding as nucleoside/nucleotide ana￾logues are excreted into the breast milk. A study by Van
et al49 showed that breast milk contained lower levels of TDF
compared with maternal blood in mothers taking TDF. The
study suggested that there was unlikely any biological effects
in the nursing infant. However, the drug safety for infants has
not been established.
Summary
Antiviral therapy in pregnant women remains a challenge and
requires an individualized and detailed assessment of the risks
of drug exposure to the fetus weighed against the benefits of
treatment. The benefits include reducing MTCTof HBV in highly
viremic mothers and managing maternal disease due to acute
exacerbation of CHB or progression of advanced fibrosis/cir￾rhosis. With our understanding of the current safety data and
benefits of HBV antiviral therapy, we propose an algorithm to
evaluate pregnant women for antiviral therapy, which is shown
in ►Figs. 1 and 2. At present, more data are needed regarding
the long-term safety of fetal exposure to antiviral therapy. In
addition, the efficacy and safety of tenofovir in the manage￾ment of pregnant mothers with CHB requires further investi￾gation. Lastly, the use of antiviral therapy to prevent MTCT in
highly viremic mothers in conjunction with infant immuno￾prophylaxis deserves further exploration and will require
universal implementation because the success of such inter￾ventions may contribute significantly in achieving the ultimate
goal of global eradication of HBV.
