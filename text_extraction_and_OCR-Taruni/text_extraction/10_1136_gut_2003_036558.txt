Background: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) giving a rim-like/membranous (RL/M) or a multiple nuclear
dot (MND) pattern are highly specific for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
Aim and subjects: To assess the prevalence of PBC specific ANAs, their Ig isotype, and their clinical
significance in 90 PBC patients from Greece and Spain. Twenty eight patients with chronic hepatitis C, 23
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 17 healthy subjects were studied as controls.
Methods: PBC specific ANA reactivity was tested by indirect immunofluorescence using HEp2 cells as
substrate and individual Ig class (IgG, IgA, IgM) and IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) specific
antisera as revealing reagents.
Results: Fourteen of 90 (15.6%) PBC patients had PBC specific ANA reactivity when an anti-IgG (total)
antiserum was used as the revealing reagent while 58 (64.4%) were positive when specific antisera to each
of the four IgG isotypes were used. The prevailing isotype was IgG3 for MND and IgG1 for RL/M. PBC
patients with specific ANA, in particular of the IgG3 isotype, had significantly more severe biochemical
and histological disease compared with those who were seronegative. None of the controls was positive.
Conclusions: Disease specific ANA are present in the majority of patients with PBC when investigated at
the level of immunoglobulin isotype. PBC specific ANA, in particular of the IgG3 isotype, are associated
with a more severe disease course, possibly reflecting the peculiar ability of this isotype to engage
mediators of damage.
P
rimary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an immune mediated
chronic cholestatic liver disease that affects mainly
middle aged women and is characterised by the pro￾gressive destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts
leading to cirrhosis.1 The characteristic immunological
feature of the disease is the presence of circulating anti￾mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) directed against com￾ponents (collectively named M2) of the inner mitochondrial
multienzyme 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes.2 Although
AMA are considered to be the hallmark of PBC, they are not
the only disease specific autoantibodies.2 3 Previous studies
have shown that two other sets of antibodies against nuclear
antigens (ANA) giving a multiple nuclear dot (MND)4 and a
rim-like/membranous (RL/M)5 pattern by indirect immuno￾fluorescence (IIFL) are specific for PBC, are found in up to
50% of patients with this condition,6–14 and may have
prognostic significance.15–18 These reports evaluated indivi￾dual PBC specific ANA specificities, the exception being a
recent study by Muratori and colleagues18 who investigated
several ANA reactivities. No histological correlates were how￾ever presented in that work. None of these studies inves￾tigated the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype of PBC specific
ANAs.
The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence
of a panel of PBC specific ANAs, their Ig isotype, and their
clinical significance in patients with PBC. In view of the
reported geographical diversity of PBC manifestations,19–22 we
enrolled two groups of patients, 55 from Greece and 35 from
Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PBC patients
Serum samples from 90 patients with PBC,1 including 55
Greek and 35 Spanish patients, were studied. All Greek
patients were followed up at the outpatient clinic of the
Academic Liver Unit, Department of Internal Medicine,
University Hospital of Larissa, Thessaly, Central Greece. All
Spanish patients were followed up at the Liver Unit, Hospital
Clinic, University of Barcelona, Spain. At the time of serum
sample collection all but five patients (three Greek and two
Spanish) were AMA positive by IIFL (median titre 1/640
(range 1/40–1/5120)). All but two patients had a liver biopsy
available for review. According to Ludwig’s histological
classification,23 30 patients had stage I (20 Greek), 17 stage
II (six Greek), 20 stage III (12 Greek), and 21 stage IV PBC
(15 Greek). Three patients were classified as PBC-autoim￾mune hepatitis overlap syndrome.24 Application of the revised
scoring system of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis
Group25 excluded the diagnosis of probable or definitive
autoimmune hepatitis in the remaining 88 patients (score
,10). Thirty two patients were studied at diagnosis, before
administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The Mayo
risk score26 was calculated as a prognostic index in all
patients. Based on their clinical, biochemical, and histological
features, 21 patients (15 Greek and six Spanish) were
classified as cirrhotic. Fourteen of the 90 patients died during
follow up; 10 from liver related complications (seven Greek
and three Spanish). Four patients received a liver transplant.
Presence of clinical signs and symptoms was assessed at
presentation and monitored during follow up visits, includ￾ing jaundice, fatigue, pruritus, and major complications of
cirrhosis, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, infection, and
hepatic encephalopathy.

Other causes of cholestasis, infection with hepatitis B and
C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Wilson disease, and
haemochromatosis were excluded. Liver function tests, urea,
creatinine, prothrombin time, and immunoglobulins were
measured by routine methods.
Pathological and normal controls
Twenty eight patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection (mean age 56.2 (17.4) years, 25 female), all HCV
RNA positive, and 23 patients with systemic lupus erythe￾matosus (mean age 36.2 (18.1) years, 20 female) were tested
as pathological controls; 17 healthy volunteer members of
staff (mean age 47.2 (17.4) years, 16 female) were tested as
normal controls.
Autoantibody detection
Presence of AMA and ANA was initially detected by
conventional IIFL on 5 mm frozen sections of a composite
substrate containing rat liver, kidney, and stomach using, as
revealing reagent, an anti-total human Ig-fluorescein iso￾thiocyanate conjugate (IgG, A, M, k and l; Dako Ltd, High
Wycombe, Bucks, UK).27–29 Serum samples were screened at a
dilution of 1/40 in accordance with our laboratory practice.
AMA reactivity was further evaluated by immunoblot and
ELISA using an M2 antigen purified from porcine heart
mitochondria (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milton Keynes,
UK).30 31
To better define the ANA pattern, all sera were also
evaluated using commercially available human epithelial
cells (HEp-2010; Euroimmun, Cardiff, UK). This line was
generated from HEp2 cells to improve the detection of the
nuclear dots pattern, which on this subline gives a dense
coarse-granular fluorescence; the HEp-2010 line also allows
detection of all other ANA specificities. All serum samples
were tested at a starting dilution of 1/40. The second reagent
comprised fluorescein labelled rabbit antisera specifically
targeting IgG, IgA, or IgM (Dako) and used at a dilution of
1/50 in phosphate buffered saline. Affinity purified fluor￾escein labelled sheep antihuman IgG subclass antisera (G1,
G2, G3, G4; Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) diluted to 1/50 in
phosphate buffered saline were also used in another set of
experiments. Each slide was examined by an independent
observer (ETD) using an Olympus BX40 (Olympus Optical,
London, UK) fluorescence microscope.
All subjects consented to participate in the study. The local
ethical committees approved the study protocol.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as percentages (%) or mean (SD), unless
otherwise stated. Differences between autoantibody positive
and negative patients for various clinical features, histological
features, and serological measurements were compared using
the t test, the Mann Whitney U test, x2 test (two by two with
Yates’ correction), or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Logistic regression analysis was performed for multiple
comparisons. Two sided p values ,0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSS (SPSS Inc., version 10.0, Chicago, Illinois,
USA) statistical package.

RESULTS
Prevalence of PBC specific ANA
Fourteen of 90 (15.6%) PBC patients had PBC specific ANA
reactivity (10 MND and four RL/M) when an anti-IgG (total)
antiserum was used as the revealing reagent while 58
(64.4%) were positive when specific antisera to each of the
four IgG isotypes were used. An additional seven were
positive for IgM alone.
MND positivity was present in 37 of 90 (41.1%) patients;
34 had positivity for IgG isotypes, belonging to IgG1 in 19
(55.9%), IgG2 in 15 (44.1%), IgG3 in 23 (67.6%), and IgG4 in
none (fig 1). More detailed data are available in appendix 1
which can be viewed on the Gut website at http://www.gut.
com/supplemental.
RL/M positivity was present in 42 of 90 (46.7%) patients;
33 had RL/M positivity for IgG isotypes, belonging to IgG1 in
22 (66.7%), IgG2 in 11 (33.3%), IgG3 in 19 (57.6%), and IgG4
in none (fig 1). Of the 65 samples positive for PBC specific
ANA on IIFL at a dilution of 1/40, 51 (78%) reacted at 1/160
and 37 (57%) at a dilution of 1/640.
Clinical significance of PBC specific ANA
Anti-MND positive patients of any isotype had significantly
more severe liver disease than those anti-MND negative, as
shown by the higher frequency of cirrhosis (odds ratio (OR)
0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.5); p = 0.003) and
worse outcome (OR 0.142 (95% CI 0.04–0.6); p = 0.003)
(table 1). Patients with RL/M had histologically more severe
disease than those seronegative (95% CI 0.06–1.04; p = 0.03,
t test) (table 1).
PBC patients with MND, RL/M reactivity, or both—of any
isotype—were characterised by histologically more severe
disease (95% CI 0.3–1.3; p = 0.003, t test), higher frequency of
cirrhosis (OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.01–0.7); p = 0.005), and tended
to have a worse outcome (OR 0.16 (95% CI 0.02–1.3);
p = 0.06) (table 1).
Patients positive for both MND and RL/M—of any
isotype—had more severe disease compared with patients
positive for single ANA reactivities or with patients negative
for any PBC specific ANA, as shown by histologically more
advanced liver disease (95% CI 0.44–1.8; p = 0.002, t test),
higher frequency of cirrhosis (OR 0.2 (95% CI 0.07–0.7);
p = 0.02), and worse outcome (OR 0.2 (95% CI 20.07–0.9;
p = 0.04) (table 1).
Patients with ANA reactivity of the IgG3 subclass had
histologically more severe disease (95% CI 0.16–1.13;
p = 0.009, t test), higher frequency of cirrhosis (OR 0.3
(95% CI 0.1–1); p = 0.06), worse outcome (OR 0.3 (95% CI
0.08–1.01); p = 0.08), and longer disease duration (95% CI
13.4–54.5; p = 0.002, t test), and were more frequently
receiving UDCA (OR 1.2 (95% CI 1.06–1.3; p = 0.02)
(table 1) than those IgG3 negative.
To assess whether the association with more severe
histology was a reflection of a link to longer duration, 24
patients positive for IgG3 PBC specific ANA were case
matched for disease duration to negative patients. Cirrhosis
was more frequent in the first group of patients (11/24 v 1/24;
p = 0.003).
Prevalence and clinical significance of PBC specific ANA
within the Greek and Spanish populations were similar to
those obtained in the undivided population.
None of the pathological and normal controls was found to
be positive for any of the PBC specific ANA reactivities of any
isotype.
DISCUSSION
Two major findings have emerged from the present study.
Firstly, disease specific ANA are present in more than half of
patients with PBC when investigated at the level of their
individual immunoglobulin isotype. Secondly, PBC specific
ANA, in particular those of the IgG3 isotype, can identify
patients with a more severe disease and worse outcome.
Discrepancies between different studies reporting a 7–53%
prevalence of PBC specific ANA have been attributed either to
the geographical diversity of the autoantibody profile in
patients with PBC or to the difficulty in the interpretation of
the results obtained by conventional IIFL.6–14 Clear visualisa￾tion of the RL/M or MND pattern is at times difficult when
AMA and other antinuclear specificities are present in the
same serum (see fig 2).4 5 Anti-total IgG antisera, routinely
used for investigating PBC specific ANA, may detect
suboptimally antibodies of IgG isotypes such as IgG3; this
is due to the fact that IgG3 represents only 6% of the total IgG
and antisera raised by administration to animals of total IgG
sometimes fail to recognise this isotype. The same applies to
IgG4 which represents an even smaller proportion of the total
IgG (2%).32 Awareness of this is of particular importance in
PBC where disease specific antibodies such as AMA have
been shown to belong typically to the IgG3 subclass.33

specific anti-isotype G antisera (IgG1, 2, 3, 4) on a representative case
by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2010 cell substrate. The use of
anti-total IgG gave a negative result (A) while anti-IgG1 gave a rim-like
membranous pattern (B) and anti-IgG3 a multiple nuclear dot pattern
(C).

Our results illustrate this point clearly: using a conven￾tional anti-total IgG antiserum, we found ANA positivity in
15% of our patients, but when we used anti-IgG isotype
specific antisera, seropositivity reached 65%. Forty four
patients positive for MND and/or RL/M would have gone
undetected if we had only used the conventional anti-total
IgG antiserum.
The use of antisera specific for individual isotypes therefore
provides a more complete picture of the ANA prevalence in
PBC and greatly reduces the limitations of conventional IIFL,
as suggested by French and Bernstein34 in 1987. Enhanced
sensitivity is frequently accompanied by a decrease in
specificity. This does not appear to be the case in the present
study as isotype specific RL/M or MND reactivities were
absent in all controls that comprised healthy subjects,
patients with chronic HCV infection, and patients with
lupus. The latter observation is particularly important as
positivity for ANA is the hallmark of systemic lupus
erythematosus and none of the 23 lupus patients tested
positive for PBC specific ANA.
Accurate detection of PBC specific ANA using IgG subclass
specific antisera gave us the opportunity to reassess their
clinical relevance. Contrary views as to whether PBC specific
ANA are of prognostic or clinical importance have been
expressed in previous studies using either conventional IIFL
or molecularly based assays.6–14 16–18 35 36 Thus, Invernizzi and
colleagues17 studying reactivity against nuclear pore com￾plex—the target of antibodies giving the RL/M immuno￾fluorescent pattern—found that seropositive patients have
cirrhosis and its complications more frequently than those
seronegative. A subsequent study by Miyachi and colleagues35
was unable to substantiate these findings although it was
based on similar antigenic preparations. Similarly, Itoh and
colleagues16 and Muratori and colleagues18 reported that the
presence of antibodies to the nuclear envelope gp210 antigen
is associated with disease severity and worse prognosis.
However, no such link was found in earlier studies in larger
groups of patients.7–9 These discrepancies may be due to
differences in study design and to the variety of antigenic
preparations used. In particular, a limitation of the molecular
based assays is the need to select some targets, neglecting
others of potential equal importance.
The advantage of the IgG isotype specific IIFL technique
used in the present study is that, by its nature, it is able to
detect all ANA specificities with the added bonus of being
easy to perform.
Of clinical relevance, our own results indicate that patients
positive for PBC specific ANA reactivities, of any of the Ig
isotypes, have a histologically more advanced disease, are
more frequently cirrhotic, and have a worse outcome, than
those seronegative. Seropositivity for anti-MND, in particu￾lar, is associated with marked alterations in liver function
tests, more advanced histological stage, presence of symp￾toms, and worse outcome.
ANA of the IgG3 class characterised patients with a longer
disease duration and more severe histological picture. The
possibility that the IgG3 isotype is associated with a more
severe histology as a consequence of its association with
longer duration of disease is refuted by the observation that
in two groups of patients matched for disease duration, those
with PBC specific ANA of IgG3 isotypes were more frequently
cirrhotic. Longer duration of disease17 but similar age may
suggest that the diagnosis of the disease in PBC specific ANA
seropositive patients is made at an earlier time point com￾pared with negative patients. Also, AMA have a substantial
IgG3 component, and an elevated level of IgG3 anti-PDC-E2
is associated with more rapid disease progression.37 Peculiar
to this immunoglobulin isotype is its ability to activate
complement with high efficiency38 and to act as the principal
mediator of antibody dependent cell mediated cyto￾toxicity,39 40 the two main mechanisms through which anti￾bodies inflict cell damage.41 Whether autoantibodies of the
IgG3 isotype are of pathogenic relevance in PBC or just
markers of disease activity, however, remains to be estab￾lished in future prospective studies.
