Abstract
Yellow nail syndrome is a type of lymphatic dysplasia syndrome
characterised by the triad of yellow nails, lymphoedema, and
pleural effusions. The case history is presented of a 70 year old
patient with yellow nail syndrome who complained of dyspnoea
caused by massive chylothorax. The patient underwent insertion of
a pleuroperitoneal shunt which resulted in abdominal distension
and deterioration of leg oedema. The pleuroperitoneal shunt was
replaced by a pleurovenous shunt on the right side which led to an
improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions, abdominal
distension, and leg oedema. A pleurovenous shunt may be an
alternative rescue therapy for yellow nail syndrome.
