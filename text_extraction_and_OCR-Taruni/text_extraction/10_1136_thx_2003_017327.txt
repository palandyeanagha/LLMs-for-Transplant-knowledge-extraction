Abstract
Background: It has been proposed that the pH of airway lining
fluid may regulate the fractional exhaled concentration of nitric
oxide (FeNO) in respiratory disease.
Methods: FeNO, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH, and EBC
concentrations of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2/NO3) were compared in
12 subjects with stable asthma, 18 with stable cystic fibrosis (CF),
and 15 healthy control subjects. Eight of the CF patients were
studied on a separate occasion at the start of a pulmonary
exacerbation.
Results: FeNO was significantly greater in asthmatic subjects than
in control subjects (mean 35 v 9 ppb, p<0.001). EBC pH, however,
was similar in the asthmatic and control groups (median 5.82 v
6.08, p = 0.23). Levels of NO2/NO3 were on average higher in EBC
samples from asthmatic subjects, but the difference was not
significant. In patients with stable CF both the FeNO (mean 4 ppb,
p<0.001) and EBC pH (median 5.77, p = 0.003) were lower than in
the control group. Levels of EBC NO2/NO3 (median 29.9 μM; p = 
0.002) in patients with stable CF, in contrast, were significantly
higher than in control subjects. During CF exacerbations, EBC pH
was further reduced (median 5.30, p = 0.017) but FeNO and NO2/
NO3 were unchanged.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate a dissociation between
EBC pH and FeNO in inflammatory airways disease.
