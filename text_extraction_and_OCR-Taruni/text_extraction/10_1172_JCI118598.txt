Abstract
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB)/Rel transcription factors
play an important role in the inducible regulation of a vari￾ety of genes involved in the inflammatory and proliferative
responses of cells. The present study was designed to eluci￾date the implication of NF-kB/Rel in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis. Activation of the dimeric NF-kB complex is
regulated at a posttranslational level and requires the re￾lease of the inhibitor protein IkB. The newly developed
mAb a-p65mAb recognizes the IkB binding region on the
p65 (RelA) DNA binding subunit and therefore selectively
reacts with p65 in activated NF-kB. Using immunofluores￾cence and immunohistochemical techniques, activated NF￾kB was detected in the fibrotic-thickened intima/media and
atheromatous areas of the atherosclerotic lesion. Activation
of NF-kB was identified in smooth muscle cells, macro￾phages, and endothelial cells. Little or no activated NF-kB
was detected in vessels lacking atherosclerosis. Electro￾phoretic mobility shift assays and colocalization of acti￾vated NF-kB with NF-kB target gene expression suggest
functional implications for this transcription factor in the
atherosclerotic lesion. This study demonstrates the presence
of activated NF-kB in human atherosclerotic tissue for the
first time. Atherosclerosis, characterized by features of
chronic inflammation and proliferative processes, may be a
paradigm for the involvement of NF-kB/Rel in chronic
inflammatory disease. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1715–1722.)

Introduction
Transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB)1
/
Rel family form dimeric complexes which inducibly control
the expression of a plethora of genes involved in inflammation
and proliferation (1, 2). The prototypic NF-kB dimer consists
of the subunits p50 and p65 (RelA), although other complexes
have been described (3, 4). In the inactive state the NF-kB
dimer is present in the cytosol bound to an inhibitory protein,
IkB (5, 6). Activation of NF-kB by a multitude of stimuli, in￾cluding inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen intermedi￾ates, and microorganisms requires the release of the inhibitor
IkB from the dimeric complex (3–7). This is followed by an im￾mediate translocation of activated NF-kB to the nucleus where
the dimer interacts with regulatory kB elements in promoters
and enhancers, thereby controlling gene transcription (3, 4, 7).
Several lines of evidence indicate that NF-kB/Rel tran￾scription factors may play an important role in atherosclerosis
(8–11). Activation of NF-kB by inflammatory or proliferative
stimuli has been demonstrated in cultures of monocyte/mac￾rophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and T cells us￾ing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (4, 7, 11, 12). All of
these cell types have been established as playing a key role in
atherogenesis and display a distinct pattern of gene expression
in this environment (10, 13). A variety of genes are induced in
the atherosclerotic lesion that have been shown to be regu￾lated by NF-kB proteins, including the genes encoding TNF-a
(4, 10, 14, 15), IL-1b (10, 16), macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF) (4, 17, 18), GM-CSF (4, 10), monocyte chemo￾tactic protein-1 (4, 19), tissue factor (TF) (20–23), vascular cell
adhesion molecule-1 (24–26), intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) (4, 27) and c-myc (10, 28). Some of these gene prod￾ucts such as TNF-a and IL-1 are also able to activate NF-kB in
vitro (3, 4). Recently, it has been demonstrated in cell culture
experiments that minimally oxidized LDL, a potential etio￾logic agent for promoting lesion formation (8, 9) activates NF￾kB in endothelial cells (29). Oxidized lipoproteins have also
been shown to modulate the expression of several cytokines,
growth factors, and LPS-induced molecules which are regu￾lated by NF-kB transcriptional proteins (30–35).
The presented study was designed to elucidate the role of
NF-kB/Rel transcription factors in the pathogenesis of human
atherosclerosis. The activation of NF-kB is regulated at a post￾translational level and, therefore, cannot be directly monitored
by detection of new mRNA or protein (3–7). Recently, a
mouse mAb, designated a-p65mAb, was developed that rec￾ognizes an epitope on the p65 subunit that is masked by bound
IkB (36–38). This antibody exclusively detects activated NF￾kB because it recognizes p65 only in the absence of IkB. The
a-p65mAb antibody allows the investigation of the activation
state of NF-kB by immunofluorescence and immunohis￾tochemical techniques at the single cell level in tissue sections

and is therefore suitable for analysis of the in vivo situation at
a cellular level. Tissue sections for the experiments consisted
of cryosections from autopsies or endatherectomies displaying
atherosclerosis (8–10). This study demonstrates the presence
of activated NF-kB transcription factor in the human athero￾sclerotic lesion in smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and en￾dothelial cells.
Methods
Monoclonal antibody a-p65mAb. Production and characteristics of
the mAb a-p65mAb are described elsewhere (36–38). The antibody
a-p65Mab can be obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim,
Germany). This antibody allows the exclusive identification of active
NF-kB.
Antibodies used for colocalization studies. The following mono￾clonal mouse antibodies were used: anti–human a-smooth muscle ac￾tin (Dako, Hamburg, Germany), anti–human macrophage CD68
(Dako), anti–human T cell CD3 (Dako), anti–human vWf (Dako),
anti–human TF (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT), and
anti–human ICAM-1 (CD54) (Dako).
Cryostat sections. Atherosclerotic tissue and specimens from nor￾mal aorta and arteries without atherosclerosis and veins were ob￾tained from autopsies and endatherectomies. Tissue specimens were
immediately frozen in a cryostat where the samples were protected
by embedding media (Jung, Munich, Germany). 5-mm sections were
cut and mounted onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO) coated slides, and stored at 2708C before staining. All proce￾dures were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Technical Uni￾versity, Munich, Germany.
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence was performed es￾sentially as described earlier (36–38). Briefly, sections were thawed
and fixed in acetone for 10 min at 2208C. The tissue was rehydrated
in 0.1 M PBS for 5 min and unspecific binding was blocked with 1%
BSA. The specimens were then incubated with the primary antibody
or an isotype control (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 378C for 1 h or over￾night at 48C. The sections were washed twice in 0.1 M PBS for 5 min
followed by incubation with a biotinylated antiisotype antibody (Di￾anova, Hamburg, Germany) (30 min, room temperature). Again, the
sections were washed twice and incubated with streptavidin-Cy3 (Di￾anova) (30 min, room temperature). After washing twice, the sections
were covered with 10:1 glycerol/PBS buffer. Microphotographs were
taken on a Leitz DMR photomicroscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)
equipped with epifluorescence optics. To be able to distinguish be￾tween the red Cy3 fluorescence (absorption: 550 nm, emission 575
nm) and the autofluorescence of the fibrotic tissue in the atheroscle￾rotic lesion, the G/R filter system (excitation filter: 490/20 nm,
dichroitic mirror: 505, band pass filter: 525/20 nm) from Leica was
used (Brand, K. manuscript in preparation). After immunofluores￾cence, the sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (HE).
Immunohistochemistry. An immunohistochemical procedure for
sequential double antigen localization was applied with minor modifi￾cations (39). The frozen sections were thawed, and the tissue was
fixed in 3.7% buffered formaldehyde (5 min) followed by acetone
(50, 100, and 50%; 2 min each). Then, sections were rehydrated in 0.1
M PBS for 5 min, and unspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA.
Incubation with the primary antibody was performed overnight at
48C. The sections were washed twice in 0.1 M PBS and incubated with
the biotinylated secondary antibody (Dianova) at room temperature
for 1 h. After washing, the tissue was incubated with the streptavidin
biotin peroxidase complex (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco,
CA) at room temperature for 1 h, washed again, and incubated in
0.03% wt/vol 3-39 diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma Chemical Co.)
with 0.003% vol/vol hydrogen peroxide until a brown reaction prod￾uct could be seen. To suppress any remaining peroxidase, the slides
were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. After washing
three times, the sections were incubated with the second incubation
series consisting of primary and secondary antibodies and streptavi￾din biotin peroxidase complex exactly as described above. Sections
were washed extensively and preincubated for 10 min in 0.01% benzi￾dine dihydrochloride (BDHC) (Sigma) with 0.03% sodium nitroprus￾side (Sigma). This was followed by incubation in the reaction medium
(0.01% BDHC, 0.005% hydrogen peroxide, 0.03% sodium nitroprus￾side) for the second staining. The formation of the dark blue, granu￾lar reaction product was monitored under the light microscope. Af￾terwards, the sections were dehydrated and mounted in DePex
(Fluka, Buchs, Germany). In some experiments, activated NF-kB was
detected using a-p65mAb and BDHC and the first DAB step was
omitted. In this case the tissue was counterstained with eosin. A se￾ries of control experiments was performed as described in Results.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear extracts from
arterial tissue which was dissociated using a pestle and mortar were
prepared and analyzed as previously described (22). Protein concen￾trations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Labora￾tories, Hercules, CA). The prototypic double-stranded Ig kappa￾chain oligonucleotide (59-CAGAGGGACTTTCCGAGA-39) (4) was
used as a probe and labeled by annealing of complementary primers
followed by primer extension with the Klenow fragment of DNA
polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of [a￾32P]dCTP
(. 3,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont, Bad Homburg, Germany) and deoxynu￾cleoside triphosphates (Boehringer Mannheim). Nuclear extracts (5
mg protein) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes (z 10 ng;
105
 cpm) for 30 min at room temperature in 20 ml of binding buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 50 mM KCl; 1 mM dithiothreitol; 0.5 mM
EDTA; 5% glycerol; 1 mg/ml BSA; 0.2% NP-40; 50 ng/ml of poly[dI￾dC]). Samples were run in 0.253 TBE buffer (103 TBE: 890 mM
Tris; 890 mM boric acid; 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with loading dye on
nondenaturing 4 or 6% polyacrylamide gels at 125 V, for 1 or 3 h, re￾spectively. As a control, samples were incubated with an excess (103,
1003) of nonlabeled Igk-oligonucleotide that completely abolished
binding. For supershift analysis the samples were incubated with anti￾p50, anti-p65, and anti-c-rel rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In addition, the nuclear extracts
were incubated with a blunt end double-stranded Sp-1 oligonucle￾otide (GelShift assay kit; Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) which was la￾beled with [g￾32P]ATP (. 5,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont, Bad Homburg,
Germany) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim).
Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography.

severe infectious disease which might induce or alter the acti￾vation of NF-kB in the vessel wall at the time the sections were
obtained. For the presented study, unless otherwise stated,
typical advanced atherosclerotic lesions with fibrous and fibro￾fatty plaques and atheromatous areas with occasional calcifica￾tion were selected from aorta and coronary, carotid and renal
arteries. In some of the experiments, tissue with less advanced
atherosclerosis still displaying an intact endothelial layer was
examined.
Presence of activated NF-kB in the atherosclerotic lesion.
To detect activated NF-kB in atherosclerotic lesions, indirect
immunofluorescence techniques were applied together with
the G/R detection filter system (see Methods). Activated NF￾kB, indicated by red fluorescence (Cy3), was identified in the
fibrotic thickened intima/media of the advanced atheroscle￾rotic lesion (Fig. 1 A). In addition, a strong green-yellow auto￾fluorescence of the fibrotic tissue was observed (Fig. 1 A). The
yellow spots may be due to autofluorescence of deposits accu￾mulating during atherogenesis (e.g., extracellular matrix prod￾ucts) since they were not observed in normal tissue as will be
shown below. HE staining demonstrated the presence of
loosely scattered cells throughout this region (Fig. 1 B). A high
number of cells displaying activated NF-kB could also be
found in atheromatous areas of the atherosclerotic vessel (Fig.
2 A). An overview of this region is depicted in Fig. 2 B, which
displays a significant accumulation of cells as determined by
HE staining. Essentially, the same results were obtained with
immunofluorescence techniques in material from autopsies
(Figs. 1 and 2) or endatherectomies (data not shown). No NF￾kB signal was detected using an unspecific isotype control anti￾body (mouse IgG3) (Fig. 3 A), in the absence of the primary
antibody or when only streptavidin-Cy3 without the primary
or secondary antibody was added (data not shown).
Identification of cell types in the atherosclerotic lesion dis￾playing activated NF-kB. The cell types in which NF-kB was
activated in the atherosclerotic lesion were identified by an im￾munohistochemical procedure for sequential double antigen
localization using DAB and BDHC (39). It has been demon￾strated for this technique that there is no color mixing or anti￾body cross reaction (39). The antibodies for the identification
of cell types were used for the first staining step which was vis￾ualized with DAB (diffuse brown reaction product). DAB
staining was prevented when the primary antibody for the first
step was omitted or replaced by an isotype control antibody or
when DAB alone without primary and secondary antibody

second BDHC staining step was omitted and replaced by a mouse 
isotype control antibody (IgG3). 3290. (C) Substrate control for im￾munohistochemistry. CD68 antibodies (dilution 1:1000) and DAB

DAB and BDHC was applied. (A) Activation of NF-kB in smooth 
muscle cells. Antibodies against a-actin (dilution 1:200) and DAB 
staining were used to identify smooth muscle cells. A diffuse brown

giving a dark blue-color and a more granular staining pattern. Cells 
displaying a significant activation of NF-kB are indicated by the ar￾rows. Activated NF-kB appears to be present mostly in the nucleus of 
the cells. 3270. (B) Macrophages display activated NF-kB. Anti

was added (data not shown). The a-p65mAb was applied for
the second staining step with BDHC to detect activated NF￾kB as will be shown below. The BDHC deposit is dark blue
and granular and therefore easily distinguishable from the
DAB reaction product. No BDHC staining was seen in control
experiments in which the primary antibody for the second
BDHC step (a-p65mAb) was replaced by an isotype control
(mouse IgG3) (Fig. 3 B), omitted (data not shown), or when
BDHC alone was added without the primary and secondary
antibody incubations for the second staining step (Fig. 3 C) af￾ter detection of the first antigen.
Using cell-specific antibodies, the presence of a large num￾ber of smooth muscle cells and macrophages and to a lesser ex￾tent T cells was identified in the advanced atherosclerotic le￾sions which we examined in this study. This is consistent with
earlier reports which identified smooth muscle cells and mac￾rophages as the most prominent cell types in the advanced ath￾erosclerotic lesion (13). Activated NF-kB could be detected in
both smooth muscle cells (Fig. 4 A) and macrophages (Fig. 4
B) in the atherosclerotic lesions that were examined. Staining
with a-p65mAb was more localized within the cell and showed
a different pattern than that obtained with the cell-specific an￾tibodies used for the first staining step. The staining pattern of
a-p65mAb is consistent with earlier results which indicate that
most of the activated NF-kB is present in the nucleus (36–38).
In addition, some of the T cells observed in the atherosclerotic
lesions showed a faint signal for activated NF-kB (data not
shown) that appeared far below the level observed in smooth
muscle cells and macrophages. A comparable low level of NF￾kB activation in T cells attracted to sites of inflammation has
been described earlier (37).
In addition, it should be mentioned that the greater part of
the endothelial barrier has been destroyed or at least altered
(vascular injury type II or III with endothelial denudation) (40,
41) in the advanced atherosclerotic regions that we used in our
investigations. Therefore, to examine NF-kB activation in en￾dothelial cells, cryostat sections were made from tissue with
less advanced atherosclerosis, hence still displaying a rather in￾tact endothelial layer. An antibody against vWf that marks en￾dothelial cells was used for the first staining step with DAB.
Activated NF-kB was detected in the second staining with
a-p65mAb and BDHC. Fig. 4 C demonstrates the presence of
activated NF-kB in endothelial cells in atherosclerotic tissue.
Little or no NF-kB activation is present in normal vessels
without atherosclerosis. Cryostat sections were obtained from
tissue taken from normal aorta or arteries without atheroscle￾rosis (nine individuals) and from superficial veins of the lower
extremity (one individual). The sections from vessels without
atherosclerosis were incubated as described above using im￾munofluorescence and immunohistochemical techniques. The
data using immunofluorescence are depicted in Fig. 5 A, which
demonstrates little or no activation of NF-kB in the intima/
media region of normal arterial tissue without atherosclerosis.
Similar results were obtained when immunohistochemical
staining was applied. In this case, the tissue from normal aorta
and arteries was incubated with a-p65mAb and BDHC fol￾lowed by eosin staining to visualize the tissue (Fig. 5 B) or cell￾specific markers (DAB) followed by a-p65mAb (BDHC)
(data not shown). Again, little or no activated NF-kB could be
detected in normal arterial tissue lacking atherosclerosis. As
an additional control, tissue from veins was examined in which
no apparent NF-kB activation was observed (Fig. 5 C).
Functional implications of activated NF-kB in the athero￾sclerotic lesion. The presence of activated NF-kB in the ath￾erosclerotic lesion was also investigated by EMSA, examining
the DNA binding activity of nuclear proteins to an NF-kB–
specific oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts were isolated from
normal arterial tissue without atherosclerosis and aorta and ar￾teries displaying atherosclerosis. The experiments with EMSA
demonstrated an increased level of activated NF-kB in athero￾sclerotic lesions compared to nonatherosclerotic tissue (Fig. 6
A) which confirms our data obtained with immunofluores￾cence and immunohistochemical techniques. Identity of the
NF-kB bands was established by competition studies and su￾Figure 5. Little or no activated NF-kB is present in normal aorta and 
arteries without atherosclerosis and in veins. (A) Normal arteries 
were investigated by immunofluorescence as described in Figs. 1 and

no active NF-kB was detectable. 3170. (B) Immunohistochemical 
staining of normal aorta. No apparent activation of NF-kB was identi￾fied using a-p65mAb (dilution 1:500) and BDHC. The tissue was

sticking to the luminal surface of the vessel. 380. (C) Venous tissue

pershift analysis (data not shown). For the same extracts, we
also examined the binding of nuclear proteins to an oligonu￾cleotide comprising the Sp-1 consensus sequence. This showed
that nuclear extracts were all of the same quality and approxi￾mate concentration (Fig. 6 A).
To test if the active NF-kB in the atherosclerotic lesion has
functional implications for gene expression, we examined the
colocalization of the activated state of this transcription factor
with the expression of the established NF-kB/Rel target genes,
TF (20–23) and ICAM-1 (4, 27, 42). Immunohistochemical
methods were used as described above. TF (Fig. 6 B) and
ICAM-1(Fig. 6 C) were identified in the first staining step, ac￾tivated NF-kB in the second step. Again, a centrally located
BDHC reaction product indicating activated NF-kB was found
similar to the pattern described in Fig. 4. Colocalization in the
same cell of activated NF-kB with TF or ICAM-1 expression,
respectively, indicates that this transcription factor is involved
in gene expression in the atherosclerotic lesion.
Discussion
This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of acti￾vated NF-kB in the human atherosclerotic lesion using a newly
developed antibody, a-p65mAb, which allows the identifica￾tion of the active state of this transcription factor (36–38). Ac￾tivated NF-kB was found in the fibrotic thickened intima/me￾dia and atheromatous areas of the atherosclerotic lesion in
both smooth muscle cells and macrophages. In addition, we
identified activated NF-kB in endothelial cells in lesions with
less advanced atherosclerosis. Our data were confirmed by
EMSA which detected an increased level of activated NF-kB
in the atherosclerotic tissue compared to normal tissue. The
hypothesized central role of NF-kB/Rel in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis is summarized in Fig. 7.
Numerous observations indicate that the smooth muscle
cell changes from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype dis￾playing fibroblast-like features during lesion formation (10).
This cell type is the major source of connective tissue in the
atherosclerotic lesion (10, 43). In the synthetic state, smooth
muscle cells are capable of expressing genes that can be modu￾lated by NF-kB in vitro, such as TNF-a, IL-1, M-CSF, GM￾CSF, or monocyte chemotactic protein–1 (4, 10, 14, 16–18).
The NF-kB involved in regulation of these genes may be acti￾vated by inflammatory cytokines or reactive oxygen intermedi￾ates all of which can be produced by smooth muscle cells
themselves as well as by monocyte/macrophages, endothelial
cells, or lymphocytes (4, 7–10). Increased activation of NF-kB
could even be triggered in an autocrine loop by NF-kB–
induced TNF-a or IL-1 itself (4, 16). Activated NF-kB has
been identified in our laboratory in cultured smooth muscle
cells using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Brand, K., un￾published observations). Additionally, two recent studies dem￾onstrate NF-kB activation in cultured smooth muscle cells by
fibronectin (12) and thrombin (44).
Macrophages represent the principal inflammatory cells in
the atheromatous plaque microenvironment (8–10). During le￾sion formation, macrophages are in close contact with smooth
muscle cells and endothelial cells and are involved in various
processes including the phagocytosis of noxious materials ac￾cumulating in the vessel wall (8, 9). In addition, there is a close
interaction between macrophages and T cells in the atheroscle￾rotic lesion, indicating that some form of immune response is

NF-kB with the expression of the NF￾kB/Rel target gene TF. Immunohis￾tochemical methods were used as de￾scribed in legend to Fig. 4. TF (anti￾body dilution 1:200) was identified in 
the first staining step with DAB, acti￾vated NF-kB in the second step with 
BDHC. Cells displaying activated NF￾kB are indicated by arrows. 3590. (C) 
Colocalization of NF-kB activation 
with ICAM-1 expression (antibody

Active NF-kB in Atherosclerotic Lesions 1721
involved (45, 46). In this environment, it is suggested that mac￾rophages express a variety of genes, e.g., cytokines (4, 8–10),
TF (20–23), or ICAM-1 (27, 42), that are regulated by the NF￾kB system in a fashion similar to that described above for
smooth muscle cells. An additional NF-kB–activating agent
may be oxidized lipoprotein, which has also been identified in
vivo in the lesion (8, 9, 29, 30). Recent data from our labora￾tory indicate that lipoproteins directly induce NF-kB in cells of
the monocytic lineage (Brand, K., unpublished observations).
The dysregulation of transcriptional systems associated with
the uncontrolled intracellular accumulation of lipids could be
one of the molecular causes that lead to foam cell formation
reported in macrophages (8, 9, 47) and smooth muscle cells (10).
Activated NF-kB was also identified in endothelial cells in
the atherosclerotic lesion in our experiments. It has been sug￾gested that NF-kB activation in this cell type may play an im￾portant role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (11, 29, 30).
The expression of several adhesion molecules involved in the
interaction of blood cells with the endothelium such as ICAM-1,
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or endothelial leukocyte ad￾hesion molecule-1 have been shown to be regulated by NF-kB
in cell culture experiments (4, 11, 24–27). This expression ap￾pears to be sensitive to certain antioxidants that are known to
be potent inhibitors of NF-kB activation (48, 49). Further￾more, activated NF-kB may modulate the endothelial cell pro￾duction of chemotactic substances, such as monocyte chemo￾tactic protein–1, that attract leukocytes to the lesion (4, 11, 19).
The principal surgical approaches to the treatment of ath￾erosclerosis—endatherectomy, percutaneous transluminal an￾gioplasty, and bypass grafting—are associated with a high fail￾ure rate due to restenosis (10, 50). This reocclusion of the
artery is probably caused by further inflammation, smooth
muscle accumulation, and thrombosis (50, 51). The increased
production of substances that trigger the occurrence of these
surgical complications, such as cytokines, growth factors, or
the highly thrombogenic molecule TF, appears to be at least
partly modulated by NF-kB (4, 8–10, 20–23), a molecule here
demonstrated to be present in an activated state in tissue from
endatherectomies. A colocalization of activated NF-kB with
the expression of the NF-kB/Rel target gene TF in the same
cell could be demonstrated in our experiments, indicating a
functional role for this activated transcription factor in the ath￾erosclerotic lesion. Therefore, the antibody a-p65mAb applied
in this study might be used as a prognostic tool to identify pa￾tients with a higher risk for thrombotic complications and re￾stenosis.
It has been suggested that proteins of the NF-kB/Rel fam￾ily play an important role in inflammation, immune response,
and cell growth (3, 4). Atherogenesis, characterized by features
of chronic inflammation and proliferative processes (8–10),
may be a paradigm for the involvement of NF-kB/Rel in hu￾man chronic inflammatory disease. Further studies are neces￾sary to characterize the role of this complex regulatory system
in human atherosclerosis.
