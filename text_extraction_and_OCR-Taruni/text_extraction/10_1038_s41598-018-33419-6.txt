Association between body mass 
index and fatty liver risk: A dose￾response analysis
Rui Fan1,2, JufangWang1,2,3 & Jinman Du1,2,3
Body mass index (BMI) is associated with fatty liver risk, however, the dose-response relationship 
between continuous BMI changes and fatty liver risk has not been clearly defined. In this study, a cross￾sectional study was conducted and a total of 3202 individuals were included. Unconditional logistic 
regression and restricted cubic spline model were used to analyze the dose-response association of 
BMI with fatty liver risk. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, gender, hypertension, total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, uric acid, 
homocysteine, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase), overweight 
(OR=3.55, 95% CI: 2.49–5.06, P=2.79×10−12), obesity (OR=7.59, 95% CI: 4.91–11.71, 
P=6.56×10−20) were significantly related to fatty liver risk. Stratified by gender (male/female), age 
(<50 years/≥50 years), prevalence of hypertension (yes/no), the above association was still significant 
(P=0.004 or lower). In dose-response analysis, BMI was statistically significantly associated with fatty 
liver risk in a nonlinear fashion (approximately J-shaped fashion, Pnonlinearity=1.71×10−4 or lower) in the 
total population and all subgroups mentioned above. Findings from this dose-response analysis suggest 
that higher BMI (overweight/obesity) is an independent, dose-dependent risk factor for fatty liver, and 
prevention of fatty liver focusing on continuous changes in BMI should be noted.
Fatty liver is a worldwide disease, the prevalence of fatty liver is increasing with great changes in lifestyle. Studies 
showed that the mean prevalence of fatty liver was more than 25.24% in the world1
, 16.73% in China and was 
predicted to reach 20.21% by 20202
, which seriously affects people’s health.
By analyzing fatty liver risk factors, studies found that body mass index (BMI), one of the most classical epi￾demiological indexes assessing obesity, was associated with the risk of fatty liver3–6
. Compared with normal BMI, 
the risk of fatty liver was approximately 4.1 to 14-fold increased in higher BMI4,5
. Although a number of studies 
reported the association between BMI and fatty liver disease, previous studies were mostly limited to dividing 
the BMI into categorical variables (underweight, normal, overweight and obesity)4–6
, which could not show the 
dose-response relationship.
As one of the analytical methods describing the dose-response relationship between continuous exposure and 
outcome, the restricted cubic combines a spline function with a generalized linear model such as logistic regres￾sion, and can visually present the effect of small changes of independent variables on the OR value of the corre￾sponding variable by the form of a continuous curve7,8
. With this method, previous studies found a dose-response 
relationship between BMI and diabetes and hyperlipidemia9,10. However, the dose-response relationship between 
BMI and fatty liver risk is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the dose-response relationship between them 
using the restricted cubic spline model.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Population. A total of 368 fatty liver cases (317 males) and 2835 non-fatty 
liver subjects (1744 males) were recruited in the current study. The mean age was (42.43±10.29) years in fatty liver 
subjects, (40.73±10.48) years in non-fatty liver subjects. Compared with non-fatty liver subjects, the participants 
with fatty liver had higher BMI values (mean±standard deviation: 26.82±2.89 kg/m2
 vs. 22.89±2.86 kg/m2

t=−24.71, P=1.76×10−123). The distribution of key variables considered in this study for fatty liver and non￾fatty liver is shown in Table 1. Significant differences were found in age, gender, hypertension, total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, glucose, HDL, LDL, uric acid, Hcy, creatinine, AST, ALT. (P=0.023 or lower).
Logistic Regression Analyses for Investigation of the Association between BMI and Fatty 
liver. As shown in Table 2, BMI levels were significantly associated with fatty liver in total subjects and in the 
subgroups stratified by gender (male/female), age (<50 years/≥50 years), prevalence of hypertension (yes/no) 
via unadjusted logistic regression and age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression (P=3.10×10−6
 or lower). 
After adjustment for age, gender, hypertension, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, HDL, LDL, uric acid,

were independently associated with increased risks of fatty liver.
Dose-Response Relationship between BMI and Fatty liver. In dose-response analysis, BMI was asso￾ciated with fatty liver risk in a nonlinear fashion (approximately J-shaped fashion, Pnonlinearity=1.71×10−4
 or 
lower) with a significantly increased trend of odds ratio as per 1 kg/m2
 increase in BMI, in the total population 
and all subgroups mentioned above, after adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, total cholesterol, triglycerides, 
glucose, HDL, LDL, uric acid, Hcy, creatinine, AST, ALT.
In the total subjects, the fitted dose-response relationship was described in Fig. 1 (Pnonlinearity=1.71×10−4
). When 
compared with the reference (BMI=23kg/m2
), the ORs (95% CI) for fatty liver risks were 0.23 (0.05–1.02) for BMI at 
18.6kg/m2
, 0.62 (0.54–0.73) for BMI at 22kg/m2
, 2.06 (1.60–2.66) for BMI at 24.5kg/m2
, and 6.09 (4.15–8.94) for BMI 
at 28.6kg/m2
, indicating a significant and progressive risk of fatty liver along with BMI increases.
In the subgroups stratified by gender, the fitted dose-response relationships were described in Fig. 2. In males 
(Fig. 2a, Pnonlinearity=2.62×10−5
), when compared with the reference (BMI=23 kg/m2
), the ORs (95% CI) for 
fatty liver risks were 0.24 (0.04–1.51) for BMI at 18.6kg/m2
, 0.67 (0.53–0.85) for BMI at 22kg/m2
, 2.04 (1.61–2.58) 
for BMI at 24.5 kg/m2
, and 6.31 (4.05–9.83) for BMI at 28.6 kg/m2
. In females (Fig. 2b, Pnonlinearity=3.23×10−5
), 
when compared with the reference (BMI=23 kg/m2
), the ORs (95% CI) for fatty liver risks were 0.25 (0.03–2.35) 
for BMI at 18.6 kg/m2
, 0.68 (0.44–1.05) for BMI at 22 kg/m2
, 1.78 (1.29–2.48) for BMI at 24.5 kg/m2
, and (3.96–
19.80) for BMI at 28.6 kg/m2
.
In the subgroups stratified by age, the fitted dose-response relationships were described in Fig. 3. In the group 
<50 years (Fig. 3a, Pnonlinearity=4.73×10−6
), when compared with the reference (BMI=23 kg/m2
), the ORs (95% 
CI) for fatty liver risks were 0.23 (0.04–1.35) for BMI at 18.6 kg/m2

Discussion
The current study showed that higher BMI (overweight/obesity) was significantly associated with fatty liver 
risk, among which the risk of fatty liver in overweight population was 3.55 times that of the normal population 
(OR=3.55), and the obese population was 7.59 times that of the normal population (OR=7.59). Furthermore, 
in dose-response analysis, BMI was statistically significantly associated with fatty liver risk in a nonlinear fashion

age (<50 years/≥50 years), and prevalence of hypertension (yes/no), indicating higher BMI is an independent, 
dose-dependent risk factor for fatty liver.
Similarly, a number of studies showed that elevated BMI was an independent risk factor for fatty liver3–6

cox model, while ignoring the trajectory between the continuity of BMI and fatty liver risk. Moreover, according 
to different standards, there are distinct diagnostic points for BMI classification11. Artificially subdividing BMI 
into segments will not only lead to loss of information, but also inaccurate results. Therefore, the current study 
focused on describing the dose-response curve when the BMI actually underwent subtle changes so that objec￾tively and clearly showed the correlation between them.
Based on restricted cubic spline model, we demonstrated that BMI was significantly associated with fatty 
liver risk in a nonlinear fashion (approximately J-shaped fashion), although there was a slight difference among 
the total population and different subgroups. When BMI <23 kg/m2
, BMI had no effect on the risk of fatty liver, 
and when BMI >23 kg/m2
, the risk of fatty liver disease increased significantly with a 1 kg/m2
 increase in BMI. 
The possible mechanism12,13 is that patients with higher BMI have more adipose tissue and fatty acid flowing to 
the liver is increasing. Furthermore, higher BMI patients often consume a high-fat diet for a long time, which 
increases the absorption of exogenous fat, resulting in the increase of fatty acids and their lipidation in liver. 
While the synthesis of apolipoprotein B and phospholipids is relatively reduced, finally lead to the deposition of 
triglycerides in liver and the onset of fatty liver. In a word, higher BMI (overweight/obesity) is an independent, 
dose-dependent risk factor for fatty liver disease, and interventions for obesity are very necessary.
Due to the difference of BMI cut-off points between China and WHO, our study should be explained with 
caution. Compared with WHO BMI classification, the cutoff values are lower in China BMI classification, leading 
to the number of subjects with higher BMI (overweight/obesity) increases and the association between BMI and 
fatty liver risk varies accordingly. Therefore, the findings in the present study may not be directly applicable to 
white or European population. In addition, although BMI is one of the most classical epidemiological indexes 
assessing obesity, it does not allow a more specific analysis of composition (i.e. lean and fat masses), which means 
the subjects with high BMI may not be obese, and the subjects with normal BMI may be obese. Thus, the asso￾ciation between BMI and fatty liver risk may not be equivalent to the association between obesity and fatty liver. 
Ongoing studies should be conducted to confirm our findings.
To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the non-linear dose-response relationship using a restricted 
cubic spline model to combine quantitative data with the occurrence of outcomes. However, a few limitations 
should be considered. First, the causal association between BMI and fatty liver risk is not certain because of the 
cross-sectional design. Second, although we tried our best to control the confounding factors, the lack of smok￾ing, drinking and other potential confounding factors may affect the conclusion more or less. Due to the lack of 
drinking data, we did not subdivide fatty liver into alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver, although 
approximately 90% of fatty liver cases appeared to be nonalcoholic14. Third, fatty liver diagnosed by ultrasonogra￾phy may provide an incorrect diagnosis compared with liver biopsy, although ultrasonography has been validated 
for diagnosing fatty liver15. Fourth, although the sample size was relatively large and more information was gotten 
through subgroup analyses stratified by gender (male/female), age (<50 years/≥50 years), and prevalence of 
hypertension (yes/no), subgroup analyses might be statistically inefficient due to the loss of power. Therefore, a 
prospective cohort study with large sample size is expected to be conducted and the data on drinking and other 
important factors should be collected to analyze the relationship between continuous changes in BMI and the 
risk of fatty liver.
In summary, our findings suggest that higher BMI (overweight/obesity) is an independent, dose-dependent 
risk factor for fatty liver, and prevention of fatty liver focusing on continuous changes in BMI should be noted.
Methods
Sample collection. We performed a cross-sectional study using data obtained from Ningbo Medical Center 
LiHuili Eastern Hospital in Ningbo City, Zhejiang, China. A total of 3203 individuals (2061 males, 1142 females) 
who visited the hospital from January 2017 to December 2017 were recruited. Subjects who were found to have 
viral, medical, autoimmune hepatitis, schistosomiasis liver disease, kidney disease or other serious diseases were 
excluded. Subjects were categorized as fatty liver according to the presence of an ultrasonographic pattern con￾sistent with ‘bright liver’ (brightness and posterior attenuation) with stronger echoes in the hepatic parenchyma 
than in the renal parenchyma, vessel blurring, and narrowing of the lumen of the hepatic veins in the absence of

findings suggestive of other chronic liver disease16,17. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee 
of Ningbo Medical Center LiHuili Eastern Hospital, all methods were carried out in accordance with approved 
guidelines, and written informed consent was obtained.
Data Collection and Measurements. The sociodemographic characteristics including region, age, gender, 
occupation were collected. In the light of the standard protocols and techniques, the participants went through 
anthropometric examinations including height, weight by a trained certified research practitioner. They were 
measured for height after taking shoes off. BMI was described as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of his/her height in meters (kg/m2
). Because of the associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and 
body fat distribution differ across populations, Chinese population has lower BMI but higher percentage of body 
fat than white or European population11,18. At the same BMI level, Chinese people are at higher risk of developing 
chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease11,18. Therefore, the obesity categories recom￾mended by the Chinese Ministry of Health19 were adopted in this study: BMI <18.5 refers to underweight, 18.5<
BMI <23.9 refers to healthy weight, 24.0< BMI <27.9 refers to overweight, and BMI >28.0 refers to obese. A 
calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer with an adult-sized cuff was applied to assess blood pressure based on 
standard protocols of the American Heart Association20. Blood pressure was measured in the supine position 
twice ≥10min apart by different trained technicians. Hypertensive patients were identified according to the ‘gold 
standard’21. All the hypertensive patients had at least three consecutive records of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
>90mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140mmHg, or had received antihypertensive medication for 
>3 months21.
Fasting venous blood samples of each participant were extracted by venipuncture for measuring the levels 
of blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), uric acid, homocysteine (Hcy), creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
alanine transaminase (ALT). Blood lipids were measured using the ADVIA2400 automated biochemistry ana￾lyzer (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) in a core laboratory with a standard protocol.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed in PASW Statistics 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Somers, NY, USA). Kolmogorov￾Smirnov test was applied to test for normality and decide on the use of parametric or non-parametric tests. 
Continuous variables including age, BMI, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, uric acid were presented as mean and 
standard deviation (SD), compared by t-test. Triglycerides, glucose, Hcy, AST and ALT were presented as median 
and interquartile range (IQR), compared by nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney U test). Categorical variables 
including gender, hypertension (yes/no), BMI (as a categorical variable) were compared by Pearson chi-square 
test. Logistic regression model was applied to analyze the correlations of BMI with fatty liver. Previous studies22,23
reported that male, aging (older than 50 years), hypertension were the risk factors for fatty liver, therefore, sub￾group analyses stratified by gender (male/female), age (<50 years/≥50 years), and prevalence of hypertension 
(yes/no) were conducted. Moreover, the restricted cubic spline method was used to detect the possible nonlinear 
dependency of the relationship between the risk of fatty liver and BMI levels, using 4 knots at prespecified loca￾tions based on the percentiles of the distribution of BMI, the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles24. Restricted 
cubic spline was performed by the Stata software (version 12.0, Stata Press, College Station, TX, USA). All statis￾tical tests were two-tailed and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
