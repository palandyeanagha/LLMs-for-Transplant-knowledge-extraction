Abstract
Background: Patients with Heart Failure (HF) show impaired functional capacities which have been related to their
prognosis. Moreover, physical functional performance in functional tests has also been related to the prognosis in
patients with HF. Thus, it would be useful to investigate how physical functional performance in functional tests
could determine the prognosis in patients with HF, because HF is the leading cause of hospital admissions for
people older than 65 years old. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarise and synthesise the
evidence published about the relationship between physical functional performance and prognosis in patients with
HF, as well as assess the risk of bias of included studies and the level of evidence per outcome.
Methods: Major electronic databases, such as PubMed, AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science, were
searched from inception to March 2020 for observational longitudinal cohort studies (prospective or retrospective)
examining the relationship between physical functional performance and prognosis in patients with HF.
Results: 44 observational longitudinal cohort studies with a total of 22,598 patients with HF were included. 26
included studies reported a low risk of bias, and 17 included studies showed a moderate risk of bias. Patients with
poor physical functional performance in the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT), in the Short Physical Performance
Battery (SPPB) and in the Gait Speed Test showed worse prognosis in terms of larger risk of hospitalisation or
mortality than patients with good physical functional performance. However, there was a lack of homogeneity
regarding which cut-off points should be used to stratify patients with poor physical functional performance from
patients with good physical functional performance.
Conclusion: The review includes a large number of studies which show a strong relationship between physical
functional performance and prognosis in patients with HF. Most of the included studies reported a low risk of bias,
and GRADE criteria showed a low and a moderate level of evidence per outcome.

Background
Cardiovascular diseases continue to be the leading cause
of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to non￾communicable diseases and the leading cause of death
[1–3]. Within cardiovascular diseases, Heart Failure
(HF) is the only cardiovascular disease which is increas￾ing in incidence and prevalence due to the aging of the
world population, because its prevalence increases with
age [4–8]. In addition, heart failure constitutes the most
important hospital diagnosis in older adults, is the lead￾ing cause of hospital admissions for people older than
65 years old and contributes to the increase of medical
care costs [5–9].
Heart Failure is characterised by a weak myocardium
with decreased cardiac output that is unable to meet the
body metabolic demands [4–6, 8, 10–12]. There are sev￾eral functional symptoms that appear in patients with
HF, such as reduced aerobic capacity, decreased muscle
strength, low weekly physical activity and exercise in￾tolerance, which are accompanied by fatigue and dys￾pnea symptoms [12–17]. Furthermore, patients with HF
show impaired functional capacities, experience a de￾clined ability to carry out their activities of daily living
and suffer a reduced quality of life [12, 14, 17]. It has
also been reported that patients with chronic HF show a
slower gait speed than healthy subjects of the same age
[18]. The maximal aerobic capacity has been inversely
correlated to the severity of HF and has been directly
correlated to the prognosis and the life expectancy [14,
19, 20]. Similarly, the lower extremities muscle mass and
muscle strength have also been related to long-term sur￾vival in patients with HF [14, 21].
Some functional tests have been used to predict prog￾nosis in patients with HF. Thus, the 6-min walk test (6-
MWT) has been proposed as a simple, inexpensive, safe
and reproducible exercise test to assess functional cap￾acity in patients with HF, which could also predict the
prognosis of patients with HF based on distance walked
[12, 22–24]. The Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB) provides a useful and indirect measure of muscle
functional capacity [12]. Moreover, the SPPB and the
Timed Up and Go test (TUG) could be used to assess
physical or functional frailty in patients with HF, which
has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisa￾tion and mortality in chronic heart failure [25, 26]. The
utility of Gait Speed has also been shown to predict
functional independence loss, cardiovascular disease,
hospitalisation, and mortality in older adults [27–31].
The 6-MWT measures the distance which patients can
walk during 6 min [32]. The test is usually conducted in
a closed corridor of 30 m where two marks are placed
on the ground at a distance of 30 m, and patients walk
from one end to the other, during 6 min [32]. The SPPB
includes 3 tests: balance (feet together, semitándem and
tandem during 10 s each), gait speed (4 m) and standing
up and sitting on a chair 5 times. Each test is scored
from 0 (worst performance) to 4 (best performance).
The total score for the whole battery that is the addition
of the 3 tests and ranges from 0 to 12 [33]. In the TUG
test patients are sat down in a chair, and at the order to
“go”, they stand up from the chair, walk 3 m until a
reach a line that is on the floor. Then, patients should
turn, return to the chair walking and sit again [34].
Hence, it would be necessary to conduct a synthesis of
evidence that explores the relationship between the
physical functional performance in functional tests and
the prognosis in patients with HF. A systematic review
may permit the formation of firm conclusions through
an exhaustive synthesis of data [35]. Thus, the aim of
this study was to answer the following PECOS (P, par￾ticipant; E, exposure; C, comparator; O, outcome; S,
study design) question through a systematic review of
the literature on observational longitudinal cohort stud￾ies (prospective or retrospective) (S): Do older patients
with HF (P), who have poor physical functional perform￾ance in some functional tests, such as 6-MWT, SPPB,
TUG or Gait Speed (E), show a worse prognosis (O)
than those patients with good physical functional per￾formance (C)?
Methods
The Systematic Review and Meta-analysis was con￾ducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
statement [36]. The systematic review protocol was
registered at the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42020177427).
Data sources and search strategy
Two independent reviewers (IJF-A and AIC-V) con￾ducted a systematic search using relevant search terms
that were developed from Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) and keywords from other similar studies from
inception to March, 24th 2020 using optimised search
strategies in the following electronic databases: PubMed,
AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science
(Additional file 1). A manual search of relevant eligible
studies, to select any studies missed during the elec￾tronic search, was also conducted using cross-references
identified in the reference lists within both original and
review articles. The grey literature databases, such as
New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Report,
Open Grey and Google Scholar [37] were examined to
identify any relevant unpublished data. References were
exported, and duplicates were removed using the Men￾deley desktop V.1.19.2 citation management software.

Eligibility criteria
The aforementioned PECOS framework was followed to
determine which studies were included in the present
systematic review and meta-analysis. Each study had to
meet the following inclusion criteria:
1. Observational longitudinal cohort studies
(prospective or retrospective)(S) examining whether
older patients with HF (P), who have a poor
physical functional performance in some functional
tests, such as 6-MWT, SPPB, TUG or Gait Speed
(E), show worse prognosis, assessed as larger risk of
hospitalisation or mortality, (O) than those patients
with good physical functional performance (C).
2. No restriction was applied on the participants’ age,
ethnicity, gender, HF diagnosis or on the New York
Heart Association (NYHA) scale score.
3. No restriction was applied on the language.
4. Studies recruiting participants from any setting
(general population, primary or secondary care).
5. Studies providing Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio
(HR) data.
The exclusion criteria were as follows:
1. All studies that did not include an observational
longitudinal cohort design (e.g cross-sectional stud￾ies, randomised controlled trials).
2. Studies exploring the prognosis value of functional
tests in patients with other cardiovascular diseases
different from HF.
3. Studies examining the relationship between physical
functional performance in functional tests and
other outcomes different from mortality or
hospitalisation.
4. Studies investigating the prognosis value of physical
activity assessed as daily activity, exercise time per
week or physical activity scales.
Study selection
Two independent reviewers (IJF-A and AIC-V) carried
out the screening of titles and abstracts to detect poten￾tially relevant records and also excluded those docu￾ments that were not original papers. The same reviewers
conducted the screening of those articles that met all in￾clusion criteria. A short checklist was carried out and
followed in order to select the relevant studies (Add￾itional file 2). In case of disagreements, the articles were
always included.
Data extraction
Two independent reviewers (IJF-A and AIC-V) identified
the following relevant data from each study: study details
(first author and year of publication), region, setting,
study design, sample size, functional tests with their cut￾off points and characteristics of participants (mean age,
%males), HF diagnosis, follow-up, outcome and main re￾sults. When necessary, an email was sent to the original
authors to try to get OR or HR data that was not in￾cluded in their original articles.
Quality assessment
The same two reviewers (IJF-A and AIC-V) assessed the
risk of bias of the included observational longitudinal co￾hort studies using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS)
[38]. The NOS has been decribed as a reliable and valid
tool for assessing the quality of observational longitu￾dinal cohort studies [38, 39].
Data synthesis and analysis
To assess the overall quality and the strength of the evi￾dence per outcome, the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) ap￾proach was used [40, 41]. Two researchers (IJF-A and
AIC-V) judged whether these factors were present for
each outcome reported at least in two studies. Meta￾analysis was conducted for each outcome reported in
two or more studies, as long as studies assessed the same
outcome with the same functional test and the same
measurement unit, that is, HR or OR. Outcomes not in￾cluded in the meta-analysis were reported using a de￾scriptive quantitative analysis. Thus, the most relevant
summary measure with the 95% Confidence Interval
(95%CI) for each study was provided. The most relevant
summary measure with its 95%CI was extracted of ad￾justed multivariate models when it was possible. In each
meta-analysis it was decided to use the inverse variance
as statistical method, fixed effects as analysis model and
the HR or OR as effect measures. Heterogeneity was
assessed using I2 statistic [42, 43]. Values of > 25% is
considered as low heterogeneity, > 50% moderate hetero￾geneity, and > 75% high heterogeneity [42, 43]. When
heterogeneity was moderate or high, random effects
were used as analysis model. Moreover, when meta￾analyses included patients with HF with reduced
(HFrEF) and preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction or
meta-analyses revealed high heterogeneity, as long as the
outcome was reported by three or more studies, sensitiv￾ity analyses were conducted including studies dealing
only with patients with HFrEF because the inclusion of
patients with different ejection fraction could be a
source of heterogeneity or could bias the results. The
mean effect sizes, 95% CI, and I2 were calculated for
each outcome and used to create forest plots for
visualization of each meta-analysis using the Review
Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 [44].

Results
Characteristics of included studies
A total of 3881 citations were identified through elec￾tronic databases, with 263 additional studies identified
through Grey Literature Sources and 14 studies identi￾fied through manual search. One thousand six hundred
seventy-one titles and abstracts were screened and 110
original papers were assessed. The number of studies re￾trieved from each database and the number of studies
excluded in each screening phase are shown in Fig. 1.
The full reference of excluded studies in the second
stage (n = 66) is reported in Additional file 3. The con￾flict of interest of included studies is shown in Add￾itional file 4. Of these, 44 observational longitudinal
cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) with a total
of 22,598 patients with HF were included. Twenty of the
included studies (45.45%) reported only patients with
HFrEF. Twenty one of the included studies (47.72%)
showed patients with HFrEF and HFpEF. The 6MWT
was the most used test (n = 33) followed by the Gait
Speed test (n = 8) and the SPPB (n = 4). The characteris￾tics of the included observational longitudinal cohort
studies are reported in Table 1.
Meta-analyses
The outcomes assessed by each study, as well as the
main results, the risk of bias summary and the GRADE
summary are shown in Table 2. Forest plots and effect
sizes of each meta-analysis can also be seen in Add￾itional file 5.
Patients with HFrEF, HFpEF and acute HF who
showed a poor physical functional performance in the
6MWT reported a larger risk of All-Cause of Mortality
[HR = 2.29 95%CI (1.86–2.82), p < 0.001] than those pa￾tients who showed a good physical functional perform￾ance (Fig. 2a). Moreover, patients with HFrEF who

decreased the meters (m) they walked in the 6MWT
during follow-up showed larger risk of All-Cause of
Mortality [HR = 1.22 95%CI (1.10–1.36), p < 0.001],
although there was no lower risk of All-Cause of
Mortality between patients with HFrEF, patients with
HFpEF and patients with acute HF who increased the
meters they walked in the 6MWT during follow-up
(Additional file 5). Patients with HFrEF and HFpEF who
showed a poor physical functional performance in the
6MWT also reported a larger risk of HF Mortality [HR =
2.39 95%CI (2.21–2.59), p < 0.001] than those patients
who showed a good physical functional performance
(Fig. 2b). Patients with HFrEF who showed a poor phys￾ical functional performance in the 6MWT also reported
a larger risk of the combined endpoint of Hospitalisation
and Mortality for any cause [HR = 1.80 95%CI (1.45–
2.23), p < 0.001] or [OR = 2.07 95%CI (1.41–3.02), p <
0.001] than those patients who showed a good physical
functional performance (Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, respect￾ively). Furthermore, patients with HFrEF, HFpEF and
acute HF who showed a poor physical functional per￾formance in the 6MWT reported a larger risk of HF
Hospitalisation [HR = 1.68 95%CI (1.20–2.33), p = 0.002]
than those patients who showed a good physical func￾tional performance (Additional file 5). On the other
hand, patients with HFrEF, HFpEF and acute HF who
showed a slower gait speed reported a larger risk of All￾Cause of Mortality [HR = 1.49 95%CI (1.24–1.79), p <
0.001] than those patients who showed a faster gait
speed (Fig. 3), above all, when gait speed was slower
than 0.65 m/s [HR = 1.59 95%CI (1.10–2.30), p = 0.01]
(Additional file 5). Moreover, patients with HFrEF,
HFpEF and acute HF who increased their gait speed
during follow-up showed a lower risk of All-Cause of
Mortality [HR = 0.85 95%CI (0.81–0.91) (Additional file
5). Patients with HFrEF and HFpEF who showed a
slower gait speed (< 0.80 m/s) also reported a larger risk
of All-Cause of Hospitalisation [HR = 1.32 95%CI (1.10–
1.57), p = 0.002] than patients with a faster gait speed (>
0.80 m/s) (Additional file 5).
Sensitivity analyses
The risk of All-Cause of Mortality in the 6MWT was
larger when only patients with HFrEF and poor physical
functional performance were assessed [HR = 2.46 95%CI
(1.94–3.12), p < 0.001] (Additional file 6). However, the
risk of HF Mortality [HR = 2.39 95%CI (2.21–2.58), p <
0.001] as well as the risk of All-Cause of Mortality in the
6MWT per increased units did not change when only
patients with HFrEF were assessed (Additional file 6).
Descriptive quantitative analysis
Physical functional performance and mortality
A score between 1 and 4 points on the SPPB was associ￾ated with a larger risk of All-Cause of Mortality (HR =
4.78 95%CI [1.63–14.02, p < 0.05]) in patients with
HFrEF and HFpEF [80], while a score below 7 points on
the SPPB was not associated with a larger risk of All￾Cause of Mortality in patients with acute HF [78].
Physical functional performance and the combined
endpoint of hospitalisation and mortality
A score below 7 points on the SPPB was associated with
a larger risk of the combined endpoint of hospitalisation
and mortality for any cause (OR = 3.6 95%CI [1.0–12.9,
p < 0.05]) in patients with acute HF [78]. However, per
each 1-unit improved in SPPB the risk of the combined
endpoint of hospitalisation and mortality for any cause
could be reduced OR = 0.81 95%CI [0.69–0.94, p < 0.05]
in patients with HFpEF [79]. Patients with HFrEF and
HFpEF with a gait speed slower than 0.8 m/s also
showed a larger risk of the combined endpoint of

Physical functional performance and hospitalisation
Patients with HFrEF with poor physical performance in
the 6MWT showed a larger risk of All-Cause of Hospi￾talisation [OR = 14.02 95%CI (4.90–40.14), p = 0.001]
[48] as patients with HFrEF and HFpEF [HR = 1.41
95%CI (1.01–1.99), p < 0.05] [51]. A score below 7 points
on the SPPB was also associated with a larger risk of HF
Hospitalisation (OR = 6.7 95%CI [1.5–30.4, p < 0.05]) in
patients with acute HF [78].
Risk of Bias assessment
The risk of bias of included observational longitudinal
cohort studies is shown in Table 3. In summary, 26
studies (59.10%) reported a low risk of bias, and 17 stud￾ies (38,63%) showed a moderate risk of bias. Selection
bias (97,72%) were usual across the included studies.
Using GRADE criteria, observational longitudinal cohort
studies reported a low evidence in most of the prognos￾tic outcomes. However, HF mortality and all-cause
mortality showed a moderate evidence in the 6-MWT
(Table 4).
Discussion
Main findings and comparison with other studies
The current systematic review and meta-analysis showed
that patients with HFrEF and HFpEF who reported a
poor physical functional performance in 6-MWT have
an increased risk of all-cause of mortality and an in￾creased risk of HF mortality. There was consistency in
the risk of all-cause of mortality and HF mortality be￾tween the studies included in each meta-analysis (Fig. 2a
and Fig. 2b) and the GRADE criteria also reported a
moderate level of evidence per otucome. Although pa￾tients with HFrEF who decreased the meters they walked
in the 6MWT during follow-up showed an increased risk
of all-cause of mortality, there was no decreased risk of
all-cause of mortality between patients with HFrEF and
HFpEF who increased the meters they walked in the
6MWT during follow-up [52, 53, 59, 60, 65, 67, 68, 70,
73, 75, 77]. Maybe this is beacuse the most of included
studies in the meta-analysis reported a decreased risk of

mortality for every 1 m increased [53, 65, 67, 68, 70, 73]
or every 10 m [52, 60, 77] increased, while a systematic
review determined that 45 m is the clinically meaningful
change in the 6MWT [89]. Patients with HF who
showed a poor physical functional performance in the
6MWT also reported an increased risk of the combined
endpoint of hospitalisation and mortality for any cause
(Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d), an increased risk of HF hospitalisa￾tion (Additional file 5) and an increased risk of all-cause
of hospitalisation [48, 51]. However, the level of evidence
of those outcomes was low according to the GRADE cri￾teria. Moreover, there was a lack of homogeneity regard￾ing which cut-off point should be used to stratify
patients with HF based on their physical functional per￾formance in the 6MWT. A distance traveled < 300 m
was the most used distance to define patients with poor
physical performance in the 6MWT in this study [47,
49, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 69, 74], while a previous re￾view reported that a distance traveled ≤350 m in 6-
MWT could be the most indicative distance of poor
physical functional performance and worse prognosis in
patients with HF [24].
A score between 1 and 4 points on the SPPB was asso￾ciated with an increased risk of all-cause of mortality in
this systematic review [80]. However, in the current
study a score below 7 points on the SPPB seems to be
the most indicative of a worse prognosis in patients with
HF since it was associated with a larger risk of the
combined endpoint of hospitalisation and mortality for
any cause and a larger risk of HF hospitalisation [78].
GRADE criteria showed a very low level of evidence per
outcome in each outcome examined by the SPPB. More￾over, meta-analysis on physical functional performance
on the SPPB and prognosis in patients with HF could

7 points on the SPPB was also associated with large risk
of all-cause mortality in older adults [90]. However,
other studies reported a large risk of mortality or hospi￾talisation in older adults who showed a score below 5
points [80, 91–93].
Patients who showed a slower gait speed also reported
an increased risk of all-cause of mortality (Fig. 3), above
all, when gait speed was slower than 0.65 m/s (Add￾itional file 5). Moreover, patients with HF who showed a
slower gait speed also reported an increased risk of all￾cause of hospitalisation (Additional file 5) and an

on the NOS was classified as: Low Risk of Bias (7–9 points), Moderate Risk of Bias (4–6 points) and High Risk of Bias (0–3 points). Abbreviations: Quality: High Risk

increased risk of the combined endpoint of hospitalisa￾tion and mortality for any cause [84], specially when gait
speed was slower than 0.80 m/s [83, 84, 86]. GRADE cri￾teria reported a low level of evidence per outcome in
each prognostic outcome in Gait Speed Test. Other
studies have shown the relationship between gait speed
and survival, death and hospitalisation due to HF [27,
94]. In fact, Dodson et al. [95] revealed that patients who
showed a gait speed slower than 0.8 m/s were more
likely to experience one-year mortality or hospitalisation
than patients with gait speed faster than 0.8 m/s.
Alfredsson et al. [96] also reported that patients with a

In brief, the GRADE classification was carried out according to the presence, or not, of the following identified factors: (1) study design, (2) risk of bias, (3)
inconsistency of results (4) indirectness (5) imprecision, and (6) other considerations (e.g. reporting bias). The quality of the evidence based on the GRADE criteria
was classified as: (1) high (further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and there are no known or suspected reporting bias); (2)
moderate (further research is likely to have an important effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and could change the estimate); (3) low (further
research is likely to have an important effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); or (4) very low (we are uncertain
about the estimate) [38] a Design: Observational Longitudinal Cohort Studies show a Low Level of Evidence according to GRADE b Risk Of Bias: > 50% (NO) of the information is from studies with low risk of bias which rarely can affect the interpretation of results. 50% (Not Serious) of the

bias. > 50% (Serious) or > 75% (Very Serious) of the information is from studies with high/moderate risk of bias which sufficiently can affect the interpretation
of results
c Inconsistency: > 50% (Consistency) presence of high degree of consistency in the results, such as effects in same directions and not variations in the degree to
which the outcome is affected (large significant effects (Hazard Ratio or Odds Ratio > 2)). > 50% (Not Serious) presence of high degree of consistency in the
results, such as effects in same directions although variations in the degree to which the outcome is affected (small significant effects or large significant effects).
> 50% (Serious) or > 75% (Very serious) presence of high degree of inconsistency in the results, such as effects in opposite directions, or large variations in the
degree to which the outcome is affected (eg, very large and very small effects or no significant effect)
d Indirectness: > 50% (NO) of included studies report similar population (similar HF diagnosis and similar age), as well as the same functional test (although
different distances or cut-off points) and the same outcome. > 50% (Not Serious) of included studies show different HF diagnosis but population with similar age,
and the same functional test (although different distances or cut-off points) and the same outcome is reported
e Imprecision: > 50% (NO) of included studies report a 95% CI, with a narrow range (it excludes 1.0), includes large effects in the same direction and the sample
size is large. > 50% (Not Serious) of included studies report a 95% CI, with a narrow range (it excludes 1.0), includes large or small effects in the same direction
and the sample size could be small. > 50% (Serious) or > 75% (Very Serious) of included studies present 95% CIs with wide range (it does not exclude 1.0) and

gait speed slower than 0.8 m/s after a transcatheter aor￾tic valve replacement, had 35% higher 30-day mortality
than patients with faster gait speed. Chainani et al. [97]
reported that gait speed and handgrip strength are asso￾ciated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.
A meta-analysis published by Yamamoto et al. [98] re￾ported that 6MWT were significantly associated with
mortality and cardiovascular disease. Frailty has also
been associated with larger risk of mortality and hospi￾talisation in patients with chronic HF [25, 26, 30, 31,
99]. Bagnall et al. [100] revealed that frailty patients had
a risk of mortality 2- to 4-fold compared with non-frail
patients after acardiac surgery or transcatheter aortic
valve implantation. Gait speed is a marker of frailty,
although frailty could be also assessed by the 6MWT,
the SPPB or the TUG [25, 26, 30, 31, 99]. In this way,
the use of functional tests seem to be useful to stratify
patients with HF based on their physical functional per￾formance and to determine their prognosis.
To our knowledge, our review is the first systematic
review reporting the level of evidence per each prognos￾tic outcome using GRADE criteria. Other reviews
showed the prognostic role of the 6MWT test or the
impact of the physical performance on prognosis in
patients with HF, but not reported the risk of bias of
included studies or the level of evidence per outcome
according to GRADE criteria [22, 23, 98, 101–103].
Implications for clinical practice
The current findings may be useful to promote func￾tional assessments that allow stratify patients with HF
according to their functional impairment. Furthermore,
accurate prognostic stratification could be essential for
optimizing clinical management and treatment decision
making, with the aim of maintaining functionality, im￾proving quality of life and reducing the number of hos￾pitalisations, as well as increasing the life expectancy of
patients with HF.
Adjusted medical-pharmacological treatment, in
addition to improve symptoms, could prevent further
cardiovascular accidents and prolong the life expectancy
of patients with HF [13]. Moreover, adjusted exercise
programs could reduce mortality, may improve func￾tional capacity and quality of life, and may reduce hospi￾talisations [5, 8]. It has also been shown that patients
with more physical activity performed weekly reported a
lower risk of mortality [104–106]. Functional tests such
as 6MWT, Gait Speed or SPPB may provide incremental
prognostic value and could help to individualize the
exercise prescription [107].
Future research
Future research should aim to determine the optimal
cut-off points for prognostic prediction and to determine
the utility of functional assessments in the management
and treatment of patients with HF. The following
recommendations should guide future research: 1) use
the same cut off point in functional tests; 2) include a
large sample size with patients with HF who show different
characteristics.
Strengths and limitations of the study
The strengths of this systematic review and meta￾analysis included the use of a pre-specified protocol reg￾istered on PROSPERO, the PRISMA checklist, the NOS
to determine the risk of bias of each study, the GRADE
criteria to assess the overall quality and the strength of
the evidence per outcome, a robust search strategy com￾plemented by a manual search, so that all studies that
met the eligibility criteria could have been identified.
Thus, our systematic review included 44 studies, while a
previous similar review carried out by Yamamoto et al.
[98] included only 22 studies.
However, there are several limitations that should be
mentioned. First, the lack of uniformity among included
studies, which included different cut-off points in func￾tional tests, should be taken into account when inter￾preting the results. Finally, most of prognositc outcomes
showed a low level of evidence per outcome according
to GRADE criteria.
Conclusion
Patients with HF who report a poor physical functional
performance in the 6MWT, in the SPPB or in the Gait
Speed Test, show worse prognosis than patients who re￾port a good physical functional performance in terms of
an increased risk of hospitalisation or an increased risk
of mortality. However, there is a lack of homogeneity re￾garding which cut-off point should be used to stratify
patients with HF based on their physical functional per￾formance in the different functional tests and GRADE
criteria show a low level of evidence per outcome in
most of examined prognostic outcome variables.
