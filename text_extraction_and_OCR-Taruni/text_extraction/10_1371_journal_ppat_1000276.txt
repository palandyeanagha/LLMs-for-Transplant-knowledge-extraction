Abstract
Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. Trypanosome Lytic Factor (TLF) is a minor sub￾fraction of human high-density lipoprotein that provides innate immunity by completely protecting humans from infection by
most species of African trypanosomes, which belong to the Kinetoplastida order. Herein, we demonstrate the broader
protective effects of human TLF, which inhibits intracellular infection by Leishmania, a kinetoplastid that replicates in
phagolysosomes of macrophages. We show that TLF accumulates within the parasitophorous vacuole of macrophages in vitro
and reduces the number of Leishmania metacyclic promastigotes, but not amastigotes. We do not detect any activation of the
macrophages by TLF in the presence or absence of Leishmania, and therefore propose that TLF directly damages the parasite
in the acidic parasitophorous vacuole. To investigate the physiological relevance of this observation, we have reconstituted
lytic activity in vivo by generating mice that express the two main protein components of TLFs: human apolipoprotein L-I and
haptoglobin-related protein. Both proteins are expressed in mice at levels equivalent to those found in humans and circulate
within high-density lipoproteins. We find that TLF mice can ameliorate an infection with Leishmania by significantly reducing
the pathogen burden. In contrast, TLF mice were not protected against infection by the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma cruzi,
which infects many cell types and transiently passes through a phagolysosome. We conclude that TLF not only determines
species specificity for African trypanosomes, but can also ameliorate an infection with Leishmania, while having no effect on T.
cruzi. We propose that TLFs are a component of the innate immune system that can limit infections by their ability to
selectively damage pathogens in phagolysosomes within the reticuloendothelial system.

Introduction
Human blood is a potentially hostile environment to colonizing
pathogens due in part to effectors of innate immunity. Trypano￾some Lytic Factors (TLFs) are a subset of high-density lipoproteins
(HDLs) that protect against infection by many but not all species of
the African trypanosome. Two TLFs have been characterized in
human blood: TLF1 and TLF2. TLF1 is a large (500 kDa) lipid
rich HDL composed predominantly of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA￾I), haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), and apolipoprotein L-I
(apoL-I) [1,2]. TLF2 is a 1000 kDa lipid-poor HDL, which is an
immunocomplex composed of apoA-I, Hpr, apoL-I, and IgM
[1,3]. Hpr and apoL-I are the two unique protein components of
TLFs that are required to give optimal trypanolytic activity.
African trypanosomes are single cell eukaryotes (from the order
Kinetoplastida) that live extracellularly in the bloodstream and tissue
spaces of their host, from which they endocytose transferrin and
lipoproteins for growth. TLF, a lipoprotein, is endocytosed by
trypanosomes and trafficked to the lysosome, wherein the acidic
pH activates TLF [4–7]. TLF forms ion selective pores in
trypanosome membranes, which leads to the loss of osmoregula￾tion allowing water influx, swelling and lysis of the trypanosomes
[8,9]. The pore forming activity has been assigned to apoL-I
because a purified recombinant preparation can kill trypanosomes
[9,10]. However, in vitro experiments show that the association of
Hpr and apoL-I in the same HDL particle is necessary to achieve
optimal TLF activity, because reconstitution of individual
components reveal that the combination of Hpr and apoL-I are
ten-fold more lytic than either component alone and native HDLs
with either Hpr or apoL-I alone have levels of activity several
hundred fold lower than HDL with both Hpr and apoL-I [11].
Hpr promotes the efficient uptake of TLFs via a putative
trypanosome receptor [12,13]. The presence of an Hp (Hpr)
receptor was initially reported by Drain et al. [13]. Recent data
indicates that the trypanosome receptor ligand is in fact the
complex of Hpr bound to hemoglobin (Hpr-Hb) [13,14] and/or
haptoglobin bound to hemoglobin (Hp-Hb) [15].
There are two other parasites from the order Kinetoplastida,
Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, which represent important
human pathogens. These parasites, which are primarily intracel￾lular, do not have an ortholog of the Hpr-Hb receptor identified in
African trypanosomes [15]. However, they do reside in an acidic
parisitophorous vacuole (PV) (permanently or transiently), where
TLF could be delivered, activated and act against them. We

hypothesize that TLF may function more broadly as a reservoir of
antimicrobial proteins such as apoL-I and Hpr-Hb that could be
released from the carrier HDL and activated, in the case of
Leishmania within the intracellular acidic PV of macrophages.
Leishmania is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a disease
whose manifestations in humans range from mild cutaneous and
mucocutaneous lesions to fatal visceral infections. Leishmania
undergoes a complex life cycle; human infection initiates with
the deposition of non-dividing metacyclic promastigotes by sand
flies biting the host skin. The parasites are then taken up by
professional phagocytes [16,17]. The major host cell is the
macrophage in which the parasite resides within the PV, a
phagosome that ultimately fuses with endosomes and lysosomes,
forming an organelle with an acidic pH. Inside the PV, the
parasites differentiate to amastigotes, multiply, and eventually
rupture the cell and spread to uninfected cells [18].
T. cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas’ disease in humans. An
infected triatomine insect vector feeds on blood and deposits
metacyclic trypomastigote forms of the parasite in its feces, which
can enter the host through breaches in the skin or through intact
mucosal membranes. T. cruzi trypomastigotes circulate and are
disseminated to the heart and other organs through the blood,
where they could encounter innate effectors. The parasite is
capable of invading and replicating in a wide variety of nucleated
cells in the vertebrate host. The trypomastigote form of the
parasite enters a host cell and is enclosed within a membrane￾delimited vacuole that rapidly fuses with lysosomes [19,20]
providing the acidic environment that is essential for vacuole
disruption and parasite replication in the cytosol [21], a critical
step in the T. cruzi life cycle.
In the present study we evaluated the effect of TLF on the
intracellular growth of Leishmania sp. and T. cruzi, because they are
parasites that traffic to acidified PVs to which TLF may be
delivered and activated. We find that in axenic acidic conditions
TLF damages metacyclic promastigotes externally and reduces
their infectivity. Furthermore, TLF ameliorates infection by
Leishmania by accumulating within the PVs of macrophages,
thereby reducing the pathogen number. In vivo, TLF reduces the
pathogen burden of Leishmania in mice, whereas TLF has no
measurable effect on T. cruzi infection.
Results
Lytic HDL/TLF damages the metacyclic promastigotes of
Leishmania under acidic conditions
The infective form of Leishmania, metacyclic promastigotes do
not divide. They are covered in a dense glycocalyx of lipopho￾sphoglycan, which contributes to their resistance to complement
killing. After deposition in the skin by the bite of a sandfly,
metacyclic promastigotes are rapidly opsonized and phagocytosed
by macrophages and gradually fuse their PV with endosomes and
lysosomes. The vacuoles containing Leishmania are acidified and
eventually reach pH 5 [22,23].
We tested the effect of lytic HDL on L. major and L. amazonensis
purified metacyclic promastigotes under neutral conditions (such
as those encountered in the tissues spaces and blood) and acidic
conditions (such as those ultimately encountered in the PV). After
24 hours of co-incubation with a physiological concentration of
lytic HDL (1.5 mg/ml), which contains TLF at physiological
concentrations (,10–15 mg/ml) at 27uC in acidic media (pH 5.2)
the L. major metacyclic promastigotes became swollen but
remained motile (Figure 1A), we could not detect any uptake of
propidium iodide indicating that the parasites are still viable (data
not shown). In contrast there was no visible effect of lytic HDL in
neutral pH media (Figure 1B). TLF binds to the parasites
independently of the pH. Incubation with Alexa Fluor-488 labeled
human TLF (10 mg/ml) (pH 5.2, Figure 1I, and pH 7.5, Figure 1J)
reveals a net shift in fluorescence of the whole population of
parasites. Bovine HDL, which does not kill trypanosomes and does
not contain TLF, was used as a non-lytic HDL control at an
equivalent concentration. The parasites remained motile and
elongated in acidic or neutral media in the presence of bovine
HDL (data not shown).
The pretreatment of L. major metacyclic promastigotes with lytic
HDL in acidic media substantially reduced their infectivity
(p,0.01 compared to bovine HDL, Figure 1C), measured by
their ability to infect BALB/c bone-marrow derived macrophages.
In contrast, there was no change in infectivity after pretreatment of
metacyclic promastigotes with lytic or non-lytic HDL in neutral
media (Figure 1D). We observed the same outcome after
pretreatment with lytic HDL of L. amazonensis parasites before
infection of BALB/c bone-marrow derived macrophages
(Figure 1E and 1F). Pretreatment of promastigotes with lytic
HDL in acidic media significantly reduced their infectivity
(p,0.01 compared to bovine HDL, Figure 1E). There was no
change in infectivity after pretreatment in neutral media
(Figure 1F). In contrast pretreatment of amastigote-like forms
(day 13 of axenic transformation) with lytic HDL in acidic or
neutral media did not reduce their infectivity for macrophages
(Figure 1G and 1H).
We conclude that lytic HDL (which contains TLF) can damage
L. major and L. amazonensis promastigotes under acidic conditions
thereby affecting their shape and infectivity. In contrast,
amastigote like forms are apparently resistant to lytic HDL.
L. major encounters TLF within macrophages
Inside the macrophages, the Leishmania parasite resides in an
acidic vesicular compartment, the PV, which has phago￾endosomal/lysosomal properties. The fusion properties of the
PV are dependant upon the life cycle stage used for infection in
vitro i.e. the use of purified metacyclic promastigotes versus a
Author Summary
Innate immunity (present from birth) is the first line of
defense against microorganisms and provides an initial
barrier against disease. Here we show that a minor sub￾fraction of human high-density lipoprotein (the good
cholesterol), known as Trypanosome Lytic Factor (TLF), not
only kills the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, but is also a
more broadly acting antimicrobial component of the
innate immune system in humans. As TLF is activated
under acidic conditions, we evaluated the activity of TLF
against the intracellular parasite Leishmania, which infects
and grows within acidic compartments of macrophages,
cells in our blood that normally destroy invading
microorganisms. Here we show that TLF acts directly on
Leishmania parasites, causing them to swell, thereby
decreasing their infectivity. Furthermore, microscopy of
macrophages infected with Leishmania reveal that TLF is
taken up and delivered to the same compartment as
Leishmania, concomitant with a reduction in the intracel￾lular parasite number. Finally, we made mice that
expressed the genes for human TLF; these mice reduced
the pathogen burden and thereby controlled the Leish￾mania infection better than unmodified mice. In contrast,
TLF mice were not protected from infection by Trypano￾soma cruzi, a related parasite, which transiently passes
through acidic compartments within cells.

heterogeneous promastigote population and the source and
activation status of the host cells [23–28]. TLFs are a subset of
HDLs and macrophages have receptors for binding and
endocytosing HDLs [29–31] and haptoglobin [32,33], 1% of
which circulates bound to HDLs [34]. We therefore reasoned that
TLF might bind to one or all of these macrophage receptors, be
endocytosed, traffic to PVs and exert lytic activity against
Leishmania at acidic pH.
We used confocal fluorescent microscopy to visualize the
potential uptake and colocalization of TLF with L. major within
macrophages. BALB/c bone-marrow derived macrophages were
infected with L. major parasites for 2 hours and physiological
concentrations of lytic human TLF (10 mg/ml) labeled with Alexa
Fluor-594 (Figure 2). After 2 hours incubation TLF (red image)
and parasites (small blue dots) were found within the phagolyso￾some delineated by Lamp-1 antibodies, which label all lysosomal
compartments within the macrophages (green image). When all
three images were merged, we observed that the parasites and
TLF are found within the PV of the macrophage (Figure 2,
merged panel, solid arrows). To determine whether the parasites
endocytosed the TLF or were coated by the TLF within the
parasitophorous vacuole we used GFP-L. major, which express GFP
in the entire cytoplasm of the parasite. BALB/c bone-marrow
derived macrophages were infected with GFP-L. major parasites for
2 hours. After 2 and 24 hours incubation with Alexa Fluor 594
labeled TLF there was no detectible colocalization of the two dyes,
as revealed by the 2D cytofluorograms (Figure 3B, 2 h; and 3D,
24 h), which represent the data collected from 25 individual z￾stacks of the two maximum projection images (Figure 3A, 2 hours;
and 3C, 24 hours). Therefore, we conclude that TLF is taken up
by the macrophages and surrounds the parasites within the PV but
may not be endocytosed by the parasite.
Lytic HDL/TLF kills Leishmania in vitro within
macrophages
The fusion properties of the PV vary with the infecting species
of Leishmania. Initially the PVs fuse with the late endosomes/
lysosomes of the macrophage and eventually become fully
acidified [22–28,35]. Within 24 hours, Leishmania differentiation
into amastigotes begins. L. major (organism of the Old World) and

TLF Reduces Leishmania Burden

L. amazonensis/L. mexicana (of the New World) cause cutaneous
leishmaniasis but diverged from each other 40–80 million years
ago. Consequently, significant differences in host-parasite interac￾tions have evolved, including differences in the PV. For example,
the PVs that harbor L. amazonensis or L. mexicana (large communal
PVs) versus those that harbor L. major or L. donovani (small
individual PVs) indicate that the fusion/fission processes occurring
at the level of these organelles differ mechanistically or kinetically
in macrophages infected with these different species [35].
In order to assess the effect of lytic HDL on intracellular Old
World L. major parasites within macrophages we added different
concentrations of human lytic HDL two hours post-infection of
peritoneal macrophages from Swiss-Webster mice with purified
metacyclic promastigotes. Bovine HDL, which does not kill
trypanosomes and does not contain TLF, was used as a non-lytic
HDL control. Two hours post-infection we observe an equivalent
infection rate of all macrophages (Figure 4A). However, in the
presence of lytic HDL the initial parasite burden of ,11 parasites/
100 macrophages was reduced to ,5 parasites/100 macrophages
(Figure 4A) after 24 hours. To evaluate the lytic capacity of HDL in
large communal PVs generated by New World Leishmania, we
repeated the 2 and 24 hours incubation with lytic HDL using
BALB/c mice bone-marrow derived macrophages infected with L.
amazonensis. Two hours post-infection we observe an equivalent
infection rate of all macrophages (Figure 4B). At 24 hours L.
amazonensis was also killed intracellularly by lytic HDL, reducing the
parasite burden by ,65% (p,0.05 compared to bovine HDL,
Figure 4B). At 72 hours post-infection the parasites begin to divide

within the macrophages. Of note the Leishmania with macrophages
incubated with lytic HDL are growing at 72 hours, which suggests
that the parasites have escaped the effect of lytic HDL (TLF), either
by transforming or remodeling their PV or both.
Once inside macrophages metacyclics differentiate into amas￾tigotes and begin to divide, this takes 1–3 days. We tested the
susceptibility of axenically cultivated amastigote-like forms within
macrophages to lytic HDL. BALB/c bone-marrow derived
macrophages were infected with promastigotes (Figure 5A) or
amastigote-like forms (Figure 5B) of L. amazonensis before treating
with lytic HDL for 24 hours. There was no reduction in
amastigote numbers within macrophages (Figure 5B). We
conclude that amastigote-like forms of L. amazonensis are resistant
to lytic HDL (TLF) in macrophages.
Lytic HDL/TLF does not activate macrophages
Binding and endocytosis of lytic human HDL (TLF) does not
activate BALB/c mice bone-marrow derived macrophages
infected with metacyclic promastigotes of L. major (Figure 6A).
There was no measurable increase in nitrite oxide (NO)
production unless the macrophages were treated with IFNc and
LPS. Furthermore, lytic HDL effectively reduced the parasite
number in murine bone-marrow macrophages harvested from
inducible NO synthase knock-out mice (iNOS2/2), which are
unable to make NO (p,0.01, Figure 6B). Taken together the data
indicate that lytic HDL does not require nor generate NO to exert
anti-leishmanial activity within infected macrophages. In addition,
lytic HDL effectively reduced the parasite number in murine
bone-marrow macrophages harvested from NAD(P)H oxidase
knock-out mice (gp91phox2/2) (p,0.001, Figure 6C), indicating
that reactive oxygen species are not required for the anti￾leishmanial activity of lytic HDL within macrophages. Lytic
HDL effectively reduced the parasite number in bone-marrow
macrophages harvested from the parental wild-type mice (C57BL/
6 mice, p,0.01, Figure 6D). The magnitude of parasite killing in
the presence of human HDL inside macrophages harvested from
all three murine strains was the same (,50%). Overall the data
show that macrophages are not activated by lytic HDL and do not
require activation for lytic HDL to reduce the parasite burden.
Transgenic TLF reduces the burden of L. major in vivo
We next examined whether TLF can ameliorate an infection
with intracellular L. major in vivo. Previously in our laboratory
human TLF was reconstituted in transgenic mice, by generating
human HDL particles that contain both apoL-I and Hpr, in vivo
[36]. This was achieved using hydrodynamics-based gene delivery
(HDG), by which single or multiple transgenes can attain a
significantly high level of expression within days of DNA injection
[37]. The main organs that are transfected by this technique are
the liver and lungs [38]. As the liver is the main tissue that
expresses the genes that encode Hpr and apoL-I (and lung), we
found sufficient production and correct processing of Hpr and
apoL-I occurs by this in vivo transfection technique [36].
To test the effect of reconstituted lytic HDL (TLF) on L. major in
vivo, we transfected mice with a single plasmid that contains either
apoL-I or Hpr. We also transfected mice with a single plasmid
which contains both apoL-I and Hpr (apoL-I:Hpr) under the
control of individual promoters, which results in HDL particles
that contain both apoL-I and Hpr [36]. We used C57BL/6 mice,
which have the capacity to resolve a leishmanial footpad infection
within 8–12 weeks and best ‘‘mimic’’ a human course of infection.
ApoL-I, Hpr and apoL-I:Hpr plasmids were injected 3 days before
an L. major footpad infection and protein levels in the plasma and
footpad size were monitored. Serial dilution of transgenic-murine
plasma revealed that the level of apoL-I was approximately
equivalent to that found in human plasma (Figure 7A), while Hpr
was expressed at a lower level in the dual plasmid (apoL-I:Hpr)
than in the single Hpr plasmid (Figure 7B). Within 2–3 weeks post
infection we observed a 50% reduction in the size of the lesion in
mice expressing TLF (apoL-I:Hpr) (p,0.05; Figure 8A), which
translates into a significant three-fold reduction in parasite burden
3 weeks post-infection (p,0.05; Figure 8B).
Although HDL particles that contain both apoL-I and Hpr are
more robust and have greater lytic capacity than apoL-I alone
[11,12], we have found that apoL-I is necessary and sufficient to
control a trypanosome infection in vivo [36]. Therefore, we next
investigated the individual contributions of apoL-I and Hpr
toward controlling the L. major infection in vivo. In order to
decrease the burden of disease and maximize the effectiveness of
human TLF, the mice expressing different human TLF genes were
infected with 50% fewer parasites, and the L. major isolate was
slightly decreased in virulence by passaging one additional time in
vitro. We found that human apoL-I (closed squares) exerted an
anti-leishmanial effect that was measurable by a reduction in the
footpad lesion size (p = 0.004), while the effect of Hpr (open
triangle) was not significant. When Hpr and apoL-I were both
expressed (closed inverted triangles) the anti-leishmanial effect

appeared to be co-operative (p,0.001; Figure 8C). These results
suggest that both apoL-I and Hpr are required to attain the
optimal effect against L. major infection. Whether mice, were
transfected with a single plasmid that expresses both apoL-I and
Hpr (apoL-I:Hpr), which allows for synthesis in the same
transfected cell or transfected with two individual plasmids
encoding apoL-I and Hpr (apoL-I+Hpr), we found that both
methods of gene delivery and protein expression afford protection
compared to control (Figure 8D; apoL-I:Hpr, p = 0.045; apoL￾I+Hpr, p = 0.006). Notably, complete resolution of the lesion
follows a similar time course irrespective of the innate immune
modulator (apoL-I alone or apoL-I and Hpr), indicating that
adaptive immunity plays a key role in the resolution of the disease.
Haptoglobin prevents lytic HDL/TLF killing of L. major in
macrophages
In order to assess the contribution of Hpr to lytic HDL (TLF)
activity on intracellular L. major parasites in vivo, we evaluated the
role of Hpr as a potential ligand that facilitates the uptake and thus
activity of lytic HDL in macrophages. Hp is an abundant serum
protein, which when complexed with heamoglobin (Hp-Hb) is an
effective inhibitor of lytic HDL (TLF) uptake into African
trypanosomes [14,15]. Therefore, we incubated BALB/c bone￾marrow derived macrophages with human lytic HDL (1.5 mg/ml)
for 24 hours with or without the addition of Hp (1 mg/ml) two
hours post-infection with purified metacyclic promastigotes. Hp
prevented lytic HDL from killing the intracellular parasites
(Figure 9).
Transgenic TLF does not affect T. cruzi infection in vivo
In order to determine if TLF would have an effect on a
pathogen that transiently localizes within a phagolysosomal
vacuole we compared the kinetics of infection with T. cruzi in
wild-type mice to our TLF expressing mice. T. cruzi is another
member of the Kinetoplastida that invades cells (including macro￾phages, smooth and striated muscle cells, and fibroblasts) passing
transiently through lysosomes before escaping to the cytosol to
replicate. The acute phase of infection is characterized by high
blood parasitemia and tissue parasitism. Mice injected with either
apoL-I or Hpr plasmid alone or both were infected three days later
with T. cruzi trypomastigotes intraperitoneally. Expression of the
apoL-I and Hpr proteins were confirmed by western blot (data not
shown). The acute phase of the infection was followed by
monitoring blood parasitemia daily (Figure 10). No difference in
parasitemia was observed between the control mice and mice
expressing apoL-I or Hpr, alone or in combination. This suggests
that TLF does not have an effect on the acute stage of T. cruzi
infection.
Discussion
Our data shows that TLF has broad anti-microbial properties,
with the ability to kill other organisms beyond trypanosomes.
Because TLF requires an obligate acidic environment to become
activated for pore-forming activity, we have focused on microbes
that reside in an acidic environment. Leishmania metacyclic
promastigotes are phagocytosed by macrophages wherein they
transform into amastigotes within membrane-bound organelles of

the endocytic pathway, progressively acquiring late endosomal/
lysosomal characteristics. The phagosome acidification and fusion
with the late endosomes/lysosomes is variable [22–28]. The
differentiation to amastigotes starts in the hours following
phagocytosis and takes 1 to 3 days to complete [39]. During this
differentiation the parasite may be vulnerable to attack because
HDL and TLF can be endocytosed and delivered to acidic endo/
lysosomes in cells that have an appropriate lipoprotein scavenger
receptor, such as SRB-I [29,31] or SR-BII [30], or Hp receptors
that are expressed on macrophages [32,33].
Our results show that L. major parasites pretreated with lytic HDL
in acidic media have a drastic change in morphology whereas in
neutral media they maintained normal morphology (Figure 1A and
1B). We observed that TLF bound equally well to the parasites
irrespective of the pH (Figure 1I and 1J) and that propidium iodide
was excluded from the treated parasites, which suggests that the
parasites remain ‘‘viable’’ (data not shown). However, the
pretreatment of L. major or L. amazonensis promastigotes with lytic
HDL in acidic media substantially reduced their infectivity;
whereas, there was no change in infectivity after pretreatment in
neutral media (Figure 1C–1F). We interpret this data as follows;
TLF increases susceptibility to host macrophage microbicidal
processes by damaging the parasites.
African trypanosomes, are killed in neutral media, because lytic
HDL (TLF) is endocytosed by the parasites via a Hp-Hb receptor
and activated within the acidified lysosome of the parasite,
wherein it forms pores [7–12,14,15]. Leishmania do not have a
homologue of the trypanosome Hp-Hb receptor [15] and may not
be able to accumulate sufficient lytic HDL (TLF) within 24 hours.
Given that the binding of TLF is equivalent in neutral or acidic
media, the data suggest either (1) lytic HDL (TLF) may interact
with the surface of Leishmania promastigotes and damage the
plasma membrane when activated under acidic conditions,
possibly by forming pores; or (2) TLF was endocytosed by
Leishmania parasites and the promastigote lysosome is weakly
acidified in neutral media, as it stains poorly with the pH sensitive
probe, lysotracker [40], but in acidic media the parasite lysosome
will be fully acidified, allowing the activation of the TLF.
TLF accumulates within the PV of macrophages (Figure 2). The
observation that all PVs contain TLF, which surrounds the

parasites but does not appear to be endocytosed by the parasites
(Figure 3), concurs with the axenic data; TLF may act directly at
the parasite plasma membrane within the PV, though we cannot
rule out that some TLF may be endocytosed by the parasite. We
find that the number of parasites within macrophages decreased
by 24 hours post-addition of lytic HDL in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 4). However, the clearance of the parasites was not
complete, which may be due to individual differences each in PVs
acidification process. Overall these data indicate that addition of
lytic HDL (TLF) decreases the number of metacyclic promasti￾gotes in vitro in macrophages. In contrast, we find that amastigotes
are resistant to lytic HDL (TLF) axenically (Figure 1G and 1H)
and within macrophages (Figure 5). Therefore, we conclude that
the window of Leishmania susceptibility to lytic HDL is after
phagocytosis of the metacyclic promastigotes during acidification
of the PV and before transformation into amastigotes (Figure 11).
Our data also show that the effect of lytic HDL on Leishmania is
independent of macrophage activation (Figure 6).
In vivo infections with L. major lead to the development of cutaneous
lesions, which are considered to arise from growth within tissue
macrophages. In our in vivo system, apoL-I and Hpr were both
required to maximally reduce the Leishmania lesion (Figure 8). The
reduction of the Leishmania lesion by apoL-I was statistically significant
(p = 0.004; Figure 8C). However, the dual expression of Hpr and
apoL-I reduced lesion size significantly compared to apoL-I alone
(p = 0.001). The reduction in lesion size was effective whether the
genes were expressed from individual plasmids such that expression is
from different transfected cells (p = 0.006) or the same plasmid, which
allows for expression from the same transfected cell (p = 0.045;
Figure 8D). Therefore, the two proteins appear to be acting co￾operatively. ApoL-I likely forms a pore in the membrane of the
Leishmania parasite directly at the plasma membrane and/or at the
lysosomal membrane (Figure 1). Hpr appears to be a ligand, which
binds to a putative receptor on macrophages and enhances the
uptake of TLF into macrophages. We draw this conclusion from the
in vitro competition data in Figure 9, which showed that Hp prevented
the lytic HDL from killing the intracellular parasites. Recent studies
demonstrate that neutrophils are the initial host cell that phagocytose
a substantial fraction of L. major parasites after sandfly transmission
[17]. Neutrophils can bind and endocytose HDLs particles [41] and
Hp [42] 1% of which circulates bound to HDLs [34]. It is plausible
that in vivo, in addition to macrophages, TLF might be endocytosed
and traffic to PVs within neutrophils and exert lytic activity against
Leishmania at acidic pH.
The co-operative effect of Hpr and apoL-I may also require Hb
as proposed for African trypanosomes [14,15]. Hb (from the FBS
in culture media and in murine blood) can be bound to TLF via
Hpr, and thereby be taken up by infected macrophages. The Hpr￾Hb complex may be the ligand that facilitates uptake of apoL-I (in
TLF complexes) into macrophages. It has been proposed that
Hpr-Hb complexes may generate free radicals by reacting with
hydrogen peroxide within the acidified lysosomes [14]. Although
free radicals could contribute to the damage of Leishmania parasite
membranes, we find that macrophages devoid of any NAD(P)H
oxidase, which generates superoxide that can dismutate to
hydrogen peroxide, are able to kill Leishmania (Figure 6C) as
effectively as wild-type macrophages. Furthermore, Hpr-mice did
not change the lesion size significantly in vivo (Figure 8C).
While the transgenic-TLF mice do not completely clear the
Leishmania infection, they substantially reduce the parasitemia. The
fact that Leishmania infection is not eliminated in the presence of TLF
is not unexpected since humans have TLF but remain susceptible to

Leishmania infection. Thus, TLF may serve to reduce the initial
pathogen numbers and limit dissemination of the parasite until
adaptive immunity takes effect. Other possible explanations for
partial parasite clearance may be that TLF is less abundant in tissue
spaces (,25%) than in blood, and therefore TLF levels may not be
optimal at the footpad lesion derma in order to act against the
parasite. In addition, the hydrodynamic gene delivery system allows
maximal expression of the proteins for ,10 days. Indeed, ,2 weeks
post-injection of the plasmid, the protein expression in plasma drops
below the limit of detection. Nevertheless, some low level of protein is
maintained for months since mice can be infected with T. brucei
several months post-injection of apoL-I plasmid, and resist the
infection (data not shown).
In contrast to L. major, we could not detect any effect of
transgenic-TLF against T. cruzi parasites (Figure 10). This finding
suggests that bloodstream trypomastigotes, which accumulate to
high numbers in the circulation during the acute stage of infection
and invade both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cell types, are
refractory to TLF. This may reflect the ability of the parasite to
infect non-phagocytic cells that may not take up HDL efficiently.
Additionally, it is possible that because T. cruzi resides transiently
(8–16 hours) within acidified vacuoles, the parasites are not
exposed to active TLF for a sufficient period of time.
These new findings support the hypothesis that TLF not only kills
African trypanosomes, but also contributes to the innate immunity
against other pathogens, such as Leishmania. The efficiency of killing
other pathogens by TLF may depend on both a physical interaction
as well as an extended period of contact between the susceptible
pathogen and TLF. African trypanosomes grow in the blood and
tissues spaces of the human host and constantly endocytose TLF,
whereas Leishmania parasites grow within phagocytic cells in fully
acidified PVs to which TLF may be delivered, but then transform to
evade TLF action. In contrast, T. cruzi parasites infect non￾phagocytic cells as well as professional phagocytes, and are only
transiently localized within acidified vacuoles, such that constant
exposure to active TLF is unlikely. We conclude that TLFs are a
component of the innate immune system, which can limit infections
by their ability to selectively damage pathogens such as Leishmania,
that reside within the reticuloendothelial system.
Materials and Methods
Purification of human and bovine HDL
HDL was purified from normal human serum by adjusting to a
density of 1.25 g/ml with potassium bromide (KBr) and
ultracentrifuged at 49,000 rpm (NVTi 65; Beckman) for 16 hours
at 10uC. The lipoprotein fraction was collected and the density of
this fraction was adjusted to 1.3 g/ml with KBr and 4 ml aliquots
were layered under 8 ml of 0.9% NaCl. The lipoproteins were
then centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 3 hours at 10uC (NVTi 65
rotor; Beckman). HDL was harvested and dialyzed against Tris￾buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5)
at 4uC and then concentrated by ultrafiltration (XM300 filter
membrane; Amicon). HDL was concentrated to about 50 mg of
protein/ml. TLF was obtained by affinity purification of human
HDL using a mouse anti-human Hp monoclonal (H6395, Sigma)
coupled to a HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The
fractions containing Hpr (TLF) were pooled and concentrated.
HDL and LDL from bovine serum cannot be efficiently
separated by density, unlike human HDL and LDL. Therefore
when bovine HDL was used as a control the lipoproteins were
purified by adjusting their density to 1.25 g/ml with KBr and
ultracentrifuged for 16 hours at 49,000 rpm, 10uC. The lipopro￾tein fraction (density 1–1.25 g/ml) was then collected, and size￾fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham)
equilibrated with TBS [1]. Fractions containing apoA-I, the
canonical HDL apolipoprotein, were pooled and concentrated.
Leishmania preparation
L. major strain Friedlin V1 (MHOM/JL/80/Friedlin) and L.
major FV1 SSU: GFP+
(b)-SAT promastigotes were grown as
previously described in medium M199 [43] (neutral medium 1),
and infective-stage metacyclic promastigotes were isolated from
stationary cultures (5-days old) by density centrifugation on a Ficoll
gradient [44].
L. amazonensis IFLA/BR/67/PH8 strain promastigotes were
maintained in vitro as previously described [45] (neutral medium 2).
L. amazonensis axenic amastigote-like forms were cultured at 32uC
in the same medium supplemented with 0.25% glucose, 0.5%
trypticase, and 40 mM Na succinate (acidic medium) [45].
Leishmania in vitro axenic killing assay
L. major and L. amazonensis metacyclics and amastigote-like forms
were incubated for 24 hours at 27uC and 32uC respectively in
corresponding neutral medium or in amastigote acidic medium in
the presence or the absence of HDL. They were washed and
checked for integrity under the microscope. Thereafter they were
allowed to invade macrophages in DMEM containing 10% heat￾inactivated FBS, 5% penicillin-streptomycin, 5 mM L-glutamine

(DMEM culture medium), at a multiplicity of infection of 3 to 6
parasites per macrophage for 24 hours at 33uC (5% CO2, 95% air
humidity). Intracellular parasites were assessed after staining with
DAPI (3 mmol/L) by fluorescence microscopy.
Macrophage preparation
Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described
previously [46]. Cells were prepared from femurs of BALB/c mice
(Taconic), B6;129P2-Nos2tm1Lau/J or B6.129S6-Cybbtm1Din/J,
C57BL/6/J and after 3 days in culture, non-adherent progenitor
cells were taken and cultured for an additional 7 days in culture
medium supplemented with 30% (v/v) L cell-conditioned medium
as a source of CSF-1. Adherent cells were harvested with cold
DMEM+0.5 mM EDTA and seeded into an 8-well Lab-Tek II
(Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) chambered coverglass
at a concentration of 50,000 cells/chamber and allowed to adhere
for 24 hours (37uC, 5% CO2, 95% air humidity) before being used
for infections.
Unactivated intraperitoneal macrophages were isolated by
lavage of the intraperitoneal cavity of Swiss-Webster Mice
(Taconic). The cells were resuspended in DMEM culture medium,
seeded into an 8-well Lab-Tek II (Nalge Nunc International,
Naperville, IL) chambered coverglass (50,000 cells/chamber), and
allowed to adhere for 24 hours (37uC, 5% CO2, 95% air
humidity). Thereafter, non-adherent cells were removed by three
extensive washings with culture medium before being used for
infections.
Leishmania in vitro killing assay within macrophages
L. major metacyclics and L. amazonensis promastigotes or
amastigotes were opsonized by 30 min incubation in DMEM
medium containing 4% BALB/c or Swiss-Webster mouse serum
and allowed to invade strain matched macrophages in DMEM
culture medium, at a multiplicity of infection of 3 parasites per
macrophage for 2 hours at 33uC (5% CO2, 95% air humidity).
Thereafter, non-phagocytosed parasites were washed off, and the
cultures were further incubated in the presence or the absence of
HDL with or without Hp (H3536, Sigma) for indicated times.
Intracellular parasites were assessed after staining with DAPI
(3 mmol/L) by fluorescence microscopy.
Assessment of nitrite oxide production by macrophages
Bone marrow-derived macrophages BALB/c mice were seeded
into an 8-well Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass at a concentration
of 150,000 cells/chamber before being used for infections with L.
major at a multiplicity of infection of 3 parasites per macrophage
for 2 hours at 33uC (5% CO2, 95% air humidity). Thereafter,
non-phagocytosed parasites were washed off, and the cultures
were further incubated in the presence or the absence of HDL
(1.5 mg/ml) with or without murine IFNc (5 mg/ml, 315-05,
Preprotech and LPS (100 mg/ml, L6511, Sigma) for 24 hours.
Nitrite quantification was measured by the Griess reaction
according to the manufacturer (G7921, Molecular Probes).
Leishmania in vivo inoculation and estimation of parasite
load
Metacyclic promastigotes (16106
) were inoculated intradermal￾ly into the right hind footpad of C57BL/6 mice (Taconic) in a
volume of 50 ml using a 28.5-gauge needle (5 mice per group). The
evolution of the lesion was monitored by measuring the lesion
thickness with a direct-reading Vernier caliper. A non-parametric
approach for several independent groups, Kuskal Wallis test, was
used to analyze the data. For post-hoc comparisons, Mann
Whitney tests were used with a Bonferroni correction. Parasite
titrations were performed with footpad tissue homogenates
obtained from individual mice and serially diluted. Each dilution
was dispensed into 36 wells to give sufficient data for Poisson
distribution. After 10 days, the growth of parasites was determined
microscopically. The number of viable parasites in each sample
was determined from the highest dilution at which promastigotes
could be grown out after 7 days of incubation at 27uC. For
treatment comparisons Mann Whitney tests were used.
In vitro HDL/TLF and Lamp-1 staining and flow cytometry
TLFs were labeled with Alexa Fluor-594 or Alexa Fluor-488
protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions.
L. major metacyclics FV1 or FV1 SUU: GFP+
(b)-SAT purified
metacyclics were opsonized by 30 min incubation in DMEM
medium containing 4% serum from BALB/c mice and allowed to
invade BALB/c bone-marrow derived macrophages for 2 hours at
33uC (5% CO2, 95% air humidity). Thereafter, non-phagocytosed
parasites were washed off, and the cultures were further incubated
in the presence of Alexa labeled TLF for 2 or 24 hours. Live
parasites within macrophages were fixed with 2% paraformalde￾hyde. Cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin. Lamp-1
staining was performed using a rat monoclonal antibody to mouse
Lamp-1 (1:100, 1D4B; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,
Iowa City, IA), followed by goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to FITC
antibodies (1:200, Sigma). Intracellular parasites were observed by
staining with DAPI (3 mmol/L) or direct GFP fluorescence of
parasites. The samples were visualized and analyzed with a Leica
TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope.
For flow cytometry on live Leishmania, purified L. major
metacyclics were washed twice in PBS and incubated (26107
/
ml) with 10 mg/ml Alexa Fluor-488 labeled TLF in bicine￾buffered saline with glucose (pH 5 or 7.5) for 30 min. Cells were
washed twice in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FBS, and 0.1% sodium
azide) before being analyzed. Flow cytometry was performed with
a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur system.
Transfection of mice
Expression of human Hpr and apoL-I in plasma of mice was
achieved using hydrodynamics-based gene delivery [38]. Briefly,
20 g male C57BL/6 mice (for L. major experiments), and Swiss￾Webster (for T. cruzi) were injected IV, in less than 10 seconds with
2 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution containing 50–100 mg of
plasmids [36]. Three days after injections and every other day
thereafter, blood samples (20 ml) were taken from the animals via
tail bleeds and expression of the human proteins was evaluated by
western blotting.
Plasma samples were separated on 7.5% Tris-glycine PAGER
Gold precast Gels (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc. ME).
Gels were transferred onto PDVF membranes (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). For western blot analysis
membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and 0.1%
Tween-20 in TBS and probed for 1 hour with the following
antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-Hpr (1:5000); mouse mono￾clonal anti-apoL-I (1:10,000; kindly provided by Dr. Stephen
Hajduk). The secondary antibodies were conjugated to horserad￾ish peroxidase, and used at the following dilutions: anti mouse IgG
(1:50,000; Promega, Madison, WI). Primary and secondary
antibodies were diluted into 2.5% skimmed milk and 0.1%
Tween–20 in TBS. Bound antibodies were detected by chemilu￾minescence using ECL (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala,
Sweden).
