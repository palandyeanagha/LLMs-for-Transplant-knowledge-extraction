tractility via V1a receptors.4
Editorial p2159
In patients with heart failure (HF), the plasma levels of 
AVP are inappropriately high despite lower plasma osmolal￾ity.5–10 The elevated AVP increases cardiac preload through 
water retention in collecting duct via stimulation of the V2
receptor,2,11 and also stimulates V1a receptors, which facilitates 
increasing cardiac afterload by systemic arteriolar vasocon￾striction.12
Although impaired hemodynamics has been estimated as a 
key to the inappropriate elevation of AVP levels in patients 
with HF,5,7,13 the exact mechanisms and extensive relationship 
rginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a central role in the 
regulation of water and electrolyte balance, and is 
an essential hormone for maintaining homeostasis in 
humans.1 AVP is secreted by hypothalamic neurons that proj￾ect to the posterior pituitary gland in response to changes in 
plasma osmolality, which are detected by osmoreceptors in the 
hypothalamus (osmotic pathway).2,3 AVP is also secreted when 
arterial underfilling caused by hypotension or volume deple￾tion is detected by baroreceptors (non-osmotic pathway). AVP 
receptors are classified into V1a (expressed on vascular smooth 
muscle), V1b (on pituitary), and V2 (on collecting duct in the 
kidney). AVP modulates body fluid regulation through water 
reabsorption in the collecting duct by stimulation of V2 recep￾tors, and also regulates vascular tone and cardiovascular con￾A

Background: Depressed hemodynamics stimulates arginine vasopressin (AVP) release, but the relationship be￾tween plasma AVP levels (P-AVP) and cardiac parameters, especially in patients with stage D heart failure (HF) 
receiving guideline-directed medical therapy, has not examined.
Methods and Results: Data including P-AVP were obtained from 162 in-hospital patients with stage D HF and from 
80 patients receiving ventricular assist device (VAD, n=46) or heart transplantation (HTx, n=34) at 3 months after 
surgery. In the HF group, considerably high P-AVP (5.9±6.1pg/ml) negatively correlated with serum sodium concen￾tration (S-Na, 135.3±5.8mEq/L, r=–0.548 [P<0.01]) and cardiac index (CI, 2.2±0.5L·min–1 ·m–2, r=–0.458 [P<0.01]). 
After VAD/HTx treatment, improvement in the CI (2.7±0.5L·min–1 ·m–2 [P<0.01] vs. HF) was accompanied by nor￾malization of serum sodium concentration (S-Na; 138.2±2.0mEq/L [P<0.01] vs. HF) and suppressed release of AVP 
(1.7±3.4pg/ml [P<0.01] vs. HF). P-AVP positively correlated with only S-Na (r=0.454 [P<0.01]), whereas no correla￾tion was observed with CI after VAD/HTx treatment. P-AVP ≥5.3pg/ml well predicted poor 2-year survival in HF 
group (60% [P<0.01] vs. 90%).
Conclusions: Low cardiac output stimulates AVP release via a non-osmotic process that results in hyponatremia 
and poor prognosis in patients with stage D HF. After sufficient recovery of cardiac output by cardiac replacement 
therapy, AVP release is suppressed and is mainly regulated by serum osmolality.  (Circ J 2014; 78: 2259–2267)

In the VAD/HTx groups, echocardiographic examination 
and hemodynamic study were performed as well as blood sam￾pling for AVP measurement in the same manner as for the HF 
group at 3 months after the operation. Of them, pairwise data 
of plasma AVP levels were available for 28 patients between 
the pre-VAD (ie, stage D HF) and post-VAD periods. No 
preoperative AVP data were available for patients in the HTx 
group. Hemodynamic data were obtained for all of the VAD/
HTx patients (n=80) before and after operation. All blood sam￾ples were centrifuged immediately for 20min, and the samples 
were stored at –80°C before the assay. All blood samples for 
AVP measurements were stored and the AVP levels were 
determined by a double antibody radioimmunoassay method 
using AVP RIA Neo from LSI Medicine Corporation avail￾able since January 2014.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 
18 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables are 
summarized as frequencies and percentages, and compared 
using Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. 
Continuous variables are represented as mean±standard de￾viation unless otherwise specified, and compared using un￾paired t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Each vari￾able of the HF, VAD, or HTx group was compared by ad-hoc 
Tukey’s test when analysis of variance confirmed significance 
among the groups. Pearson product-moment correlation coef￾ficient was used to evaluate the relationship between plasma 
levels of AVP and other clinical parameters. Each clinical 
parameter was compared by paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed￾rank test as appropriate in the VAD group during the study 
period. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was 
performed to obtain a cutoff level of plasma AVP for 2-year 
survival. To examine the effect of the plasma levels of AVP 
on prognosis, Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test and 
Cox proportional-hazard model were adopted. Inter-rater reli￾ability between echocardiography and hemodynamic study for 
CI was analyzed by calculating intraclass correlation coeffi￾cients. All hypothesis tests reported are 2-tailed, and used a 
P-value <0.05 as significant.
Results
Comparison of Patients’ Characteristics Among HF, VAD, 
and HTx Groups (Table 1)
All patients in the HF group were assigned stage D, and GDMT 
was introduced and optimized in >80% of patients; inotropes 
were intravenously infused in >40% of patients. In total, 65 
(40.1%) patients were not candidates for VAD/HTx treatment 
because of their age (>65 years old), 21 patients (13.0%) be￾cause of end-organ dysfunction, and 32 patients (19.8%) be￾cause of systemic diseases or social problems; 28 patients 
(17.3%) underwent VAD implantation during the study peri￾od. No patients received tolvaptan before enrollment.
Patients who had VAD/HTx showed improved hemody￾namics (Table 2), together with recovery of end-organ dys￾function and normalization of hyponatremia compared with 
the HF group (Figure 1). There were no significant differences 
in hemodynamics before (ie, under VAD treatment) and after 
HTx (Table 2). There were no significant differences in car￾diac index (CI), plasma levels of BNP or the serum sodium 
concentration (S-Na) level between the VAD and HTx groups 
(Figure 1). In 64 patients in the HF group and 80 in the VAD/
HTx group, CI measured by echocardiography and hemody￾namic study had high intraclass correlation coefficients (0.992, 
between plasma AVP levels and other cardiac parameters have 
remained unknown thus far. Furthermore, almost all studies of 
AVP were executed before the establishment of guideline￾directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF including β-blockers, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and aldoste￾rone antagonists. If hemodynamics really matter in terms of 
non-osmotic AVP release, stage D HF should be associated 
with higher AVP levels in comparison with other stages. Dra￾matic changes in the plasma levels of AVP after ventricular 
assist device (VAD) implantation or heart transplantation 
(HTx) should also be expected in those patients. However, 
stage classification has recently been developed in the guide￾lines,14 and AVP levels have not been measured according to 
the new classification of HF. Therefore, we here examined the 
relationship between plasma AVP levels and other cardiac 
parameters in patients with stage D HF before and after VAD/
HTx treatment.
Methods
Patient Selection
Of consecutive patients who were hospitalized for stage D HF 
and followed at the University of Tokyo Hospital between July 
2011 and November 2013, 162 patients who were diagnosed 
as stage D HF by the Framingham Criteria15 and the guideline 
of the American Heart Association14 were retrospectively en￾rolled in this study (HF group). All patients were refractory to 
GDMT consisting of β-blocker, ACEI/ARB, and aldosterone 
antagonist.
VAD group consisted of consecutive 46 stage D HF pa￾tients who implanted either type of pulsatile or continuous 
flow VAD. After LVAD implantation, we followed GDMT to 
optimize the dosing of medicine as much as tolerated consid￾ering each patient’s hemodynamics. The setting of pulsatile 
VAD was adjusted as full-fill full-empty mode for maximum 
support under non-synchronous mode. The rotation speed of 
continuous flow VAD was also adjusted appropriately consid￾ering patients’ hemodynamics and interventricular septum 
shift observed in transthoracic echocardiography. The HTx 
group included 34 patients who had once had stage D HF and 
had been bridged from VAD therapy, but we did not include 
anyone of HTx group in HF or VAD group because of lack in 
AVP data during pre-HTx period.
Written informed consent was obtained at admission time 
from the patients and/or their family members in all cases. The 
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Grad￾uate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo [application 
no. 779 (1)].
Variables Evaluated
In the HF group, blood samples for AVP measurement were 
obtained after resting supine for 15min in the early morning 
before taking any daily medicine while in a steady state after 
the treatment of acute exacerbation of HF. Echocardiographic 
examination was also executed while in a steady state, and 
cardiac output (CO) was calculated using Doppler-derived 
aortic flow signals based on the principle that the velocity time 
integral of blood flow multiplied by the cross-sectional area of 
the left ventricle outflow estimates CO volume. In patients with 
VAD support, total CO was calculated as the summation of 
the CO of the native heart calculated by the Doppler method 
described above and the estimated VAD flow. There were no 
patients with moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. In 64 of 
the HF patients, CO measurement by right heart catheteriza￾tion was also performed while in the steady state.

tween the VAD and HTx groups (Table 1, Figure 1). In 28 
patients who had VAD implantation, pairwise measurement 
of plasma AVP levels confirmed that marked decreases in AVP 
levels were associated with improvement of CI and normaliza￾tion of plasma BNP levels and S-Na (all P<0.01; Figure 2).
In the HF group (n=162), plasma AVP levels significantly 
correlated with CI, ejection fraction, plasma BNP levels, and 
S-Na (Table 3). Higher plasma levels of AVP were associ￾ated with lower CI (Figure 3A), higher plasma levels of BNP 
(Figure 3B), and lower S-Na (Figure 3C). There were 5 pa￾P<0.001).
Relationship Between Plasma Levels of AVP and Other 
Clinical Parameters in HF and VAD/HTx Groups
Plasma AVP levels had a non-normal distribution in the HF 
and VAD/HTx groups (P<0.05 by Shapiro-Wilk’s test). Un￾like the plasma BNP levels, plasma AVP levels were not log￾normally distributed. Plasma AVP levels were significantly 
lower in the VAD/HTx group (n=80) than in the HF group 
(n=162), whereas plasma AVP levels were not different be￾Figure 1.  Comparison of CI (A), plasma levels of BNP (B) and AVP (C), and S-Na (D) in HF (n=162), VAD (n=46), and HTx groups

5.3pg/ml (area under curve, 0.681; sensitivity, 0.708; specific￾ity, 0.674). According to the cutoff level of plasma AVP, pa￾tients were stratified into 2 groups, and Kaplan-Meier analyses 
showed significant differences between them in terms of all￾cause survival over 2 years (P<0.001). Cox regression analysis 
demonstrated that higher plasma levels of AVP were signifi￾cantly associated with decreased survival (hazard ratio, 4.803; 
95% confidence interval, 2.045–11.28; P<0.001). In contrast, 
plasma levels of AVP had no significant effect on mortality in 
the VAD/HTx group (P=0.254 by Cox regression analysis).
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that a lower CO had a signifi￾cant correlation with increased secretion of AVP, and that el￾evated plasma levels of AVP were significantly associated with 
hyponatremia and poor prognosis in patients with stage D HF. 
Plasma AVP levels normalized along with the improvement 
of CO after VAD/HTx treatment, and positively correlated with 
S-Na, in contrast to the HF group. VAD treatment was as ef￾ficient at improving hemodynamics and reducing plasma lev￾els of AVP as HTx.
tients with extremely high plasma AVP levels (>20pg/ml), 
whose CI were <2.0L·min–1 ·m–2, plasma BNP >1,500pg/ml, 
and S-Na <130mEq/L. Although all hemodynamic parameters 
were improved after VAD implantation (all P<0.05; Table 2), 
only CI negatively correlated with the plasma level of AVP 
among the hemodynamic parameters (P=0.008, r=–0.516) 
(Table 4) in the stage D HF patients in whom a hemodynamic 
study was performed before VAD implantation (n=64).
In the VAD/HTx group (n=80), plasma AVP levels had 
no correlation with CI (Figure 3D) or plasma BNP levels 
(Figure 3E). None of hemodynamic parameters correlated 
with plasma AVP levels in the VAD/HTx group (Table 4). 
The only significant correlation was between the plasma AVP 
level and S-Na (Table 3), but in sharp contrast to the HF pa￾tients, higher AVP levels were accompanied by higher S-Na 
in the VAD/HTx group (Figure 3F).

Patients With Stage D HF (Figure 4)
In the HF group, 24 patients (14.8%) died during the study

speculated.5,13 Uretsky et al’s data that demonstrated a signifi￾cant negative correlation between changes in systemic blood 
pressure and plasma AVP levels after intravenous infusion of 
vasodilator accompanied by non-significant increases in CO 
would support our result,7 although the correlation between 
blood pressure and AVP levels barely reached statistical sig￾nificance in our analysis.
Neurohumoral activation, which contributes to the malig￾nant cycle of HF,19 results in higher levels of AVP (6.5–
9.5pg/ml) according to previous studies,5,10,20,21 but all those 
studies were executed before the current GDMT was estab￾lished. Relatively lower plasma levels of AVP in our study 
(average 5.9±6.1pg/ml) may be attributable to the effective 
suppression of neurohumoral activity by the application of 
GDMT including β-blocker, ACEI, and aldosterone blocker at 
high rates (92.6%, 82.7%, and 63.6%, respectively). The re￾cently reported subanalysis of the EVEREST study consistently 
included 78% of patients with plasma AVP levels ≤8pg/ml 
receiving high rates of β-blocker and ACEI (83% and 74%, 
respectively) therapy.6
In this study, S-Na negatively correlated with plasma AVP 
levels in patients with stage D HF. Secreted AVP binds V2
receptor located in collecting duct, and activates the signaling 
cascade including aquaporin 2, which facilitates water reab￾sorption and often causes dilution hyponatremia.2,11,22 Only a 
few authors have previously reported such a correlation among 
Non-Osmotic Regulation of AVP in Stage D HF
AVP secretion is regulated by a non-osmotic pathway that is 
responsive to such stimuli as decreased circulation, hypoxia, 
intravenous inotropic infusion, activation of renin-angiotensin￾aldosterone, and sympathetic nerve system stimulation.5,16–18
The non-osmotic pathway has been considered a dominant 
modulator of plasma AVP levels in hemodynamically sick 
conditions, including HF, although no quantitative studies have 
been reported thus far, especially in patients with stage D HF.
This study is a novel quantitative study that demonstrated a 
significant negative correlation between CO and plasma AVP 
levels in patients with stage D HF. Other hemodynamic pa￾rameters including right atrial pressure and pulmonary capil￾lary wedge pressure did not correlate with plasma AVP levels. 
As a non-osmotic trigger, arterial underfilling caused by low 
CO rather than congestion contributes to the secretion of AVP.
Interestingly, improvement of CO by VAD treatment was 
as sufficient to normalize the plasma levels of AVP as HTx. 
Hemodynamic parameters in the VAD group were consis￾tently indistinguishable from those of the HTx group. In other 
words, not only HTx but also VAD treatment can be a cardiac 
replacement therapy from the viewpoint of sufficient reduc￾tion of plasma AVP levels. Our observation was consistent 
with the fact that the non-osmotic trigger of impaired hemo￾dynamics may be a key to stimulating AVP secretion in pa￾tients with advanced HF, as several authors have previously

tal, species differences, circadian rhythm, or the nature of 
solute providing the osmotic stimuli can significantly affect 
the release of AVP by altering the threshold and/or the sensi￾tivity of osmoreceptors.4,24,25 Consistently, plasma levels of 
AVP had a positive correlation with S-Na but not with CO or 
plasma BNP levels in our VAD/HTx group whose hemody￾namics appeared to be almost normal. In other words, AVP 
secretion was mainly regulated by S-Na in an osmotic manner 
after VAD/HTx treatment under hemodynamically stable con￾small numbers of HF patients or those with acute myocardial 
infarction.8,23 We believe that ours is a noteworthy report show￾ing the close relationship of low CO, increased AVP and hy￾ponatremia in advanced HF.
Osmotic Regulation of Plasma AVP After Improvement of 
Hemodynamics
The osmotic control of AVP release is one of 2 modulators of

pressure, in patients with HF.5 We recently reported that a V2
receptor antagonist improved congestion and hyponatremia 
especially in HF patients with preserved function of collecting 
duct during short-term clinical course.27,28 It would be a future 
concern whether a V2 receptor antagonist improves long-term 
prognosis in patients with stage D HF.
Study Limitations
All data were analyzed in a retrospective manner, and our re￾sult was derived only from the observational analyses. Our 
result should be tested in a prospective manner. Data for the 
HF, VAD, and HTx groups were unpaired except for 28 pa￾tients who received VAD implantation during the study peri￾od. Consecutive observation during HF duration and VAD/
HTx treatment in larger populations would strengthen our re￾sults. CO was estimated by echocardiography in most of the 
HF patients, although data were validated by hemodynamic 
study in 64 of the HF group as well as 80 of the VAD/HTx 
group. Because we included only patients with stage D HF as 
the HF group, our results may not be adopted in cases of mild 
to moderate HF. We evaluated AVP levels in patients with 
VAD/HTx at 3 months after operation, considering hemody￾namic stability. However, future studies are needed to clarify 
whether osmotic AVP regulation is maintained for longer after 
surgery.
Conclusions
In patients with stage D HF, low CO stimulates AVP release 
via a non-osmotic pathway, and elevated AVP results in hy￾ponatremia and poor prognosis. After sufficient recovery of 
hemodynamics by VAD/HTx therapy, AVP release is sup￾pressed and is mainly regulated by serum osmolality. VAD 
treatment was as sufficient to improve hemodynamics and re￾duce plasma AVP levels as HTx.

the dominant mechanism of AVP secretion from a non-osmot￾ic pathway to an osmotic pathway by improving hemodynam￾ics.
Plasma Levels of AVP and Prognosis
There have been no studies demonstrating increased plasma 
levels of AVP as a significant predictor for prognosis except 
for the recent subanalysis of the EVEREST study.6 Their cut￾off value of plasma AVP was almost consistent with our result 
(8.0 vs. 5.2pg/ml). They adopted the upper limit of the healthy 
population (ie, 8.0pg/ml) as the cutoff value, whereas we de￾rived our cutoff value of 5.2pg/ml by ROC analysis. Elevated 
AVP may have a crucial role in the vicious cycle of worsening 
HF, because it results from hemodynamic decline, and facili￾tates worsening of HF including hyponatremia and increased 
preload and afterload to the heart.26 Consistently, elevated 
AVP levels were associated with lower CI and S-Na in the 
present study (Figure 3). Goldsmith et al experimentally dem￾onstrated that intravenous infusion of AVP caused adverse 
circulatory effects, including decreases in CO and increases in 
systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge
