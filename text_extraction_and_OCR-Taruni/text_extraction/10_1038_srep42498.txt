The inflammatory responses of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) are critical in the development of 
many cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Let-7e is an important regulator of endothelial function and 
inflammation. However, the effects and mechanisms of let-7e on VECs inflammation have not been 
studied until recently. Thus, we investigated these issues and found that in addition to proliferation, 
apoptosis and cell adhesion, let-7e was also implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses 
through a complex network, including IκBβ and lncRNA lnc-MKI67IP-3. Let-7e promoted NF-κB 
activation and translocation to the nucleus by inhibiting its target gene (IκBβ) expression and 
subsequently increased the expression of inflammatory and adhesion molecules. Meanwhile, lnc￾MKI67IP-3 acted as a sponge or competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for let-7e, suppressing its pro￾inflammatory effects, and let-7e decreased lnc-MKI67IP-3 expression, thereby forming a positive 
feedback loop to aggravate inflammation. Moreover, let-7e, lnc-MKI67IP-3 and IκBβ were also 
abnormal in oxLDL-treated VECs and atherosclerotic plaques. The present study revealed let-7e as a 
pro-inflammatory mediator and a novel regulatory mechanism for the NF-κB pathway through ceRNA 
crosstalk, comprising let-7e and its target IκBβ and the ceRNA lnc-MKI67IP-3. Thus, this molecule might 
play important roles in the inflammatory responses of VECs and development of atherosclerosis.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are crucial in the regulation of 
immune and inflammatory responses1
. In ECs activated by inflammatory stimuli, many adhesion molecules 
and pro-inflammatory cytokines are up-regulated (such as ICAM1, E-selectin and IL-6) with the suppression 
of anti-inflammatory cytokines. These molecules promote the lymphocytes, monocytes and other immune cells 
to adhere and migrate through the vessel wall into inflammatory sites1,2. After the elimination of inflammatory 
stimuli, pro- and anti-inflammatory factors are rebalanced and ECs return to the resting state. The endothelial 
dysfunction resulting from excessive and/or prolonged inflammation is one of the most important initiating 
events in the development of atherosclerosis and many other cardio-cerebrovascular diseases3
. Many cells and 
molecules are involved in the inflammatory response of ECs. Therefore, its regulation mechanisms are extremely 
complex and have not been fully elucidated thus far, and more novel regulators should be identified.
MiRNAs are endogenous non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression 
through binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of their targets. Many studies have demonstrated miRNAs 
as key regulators of inflammation in ECs. For example, miR-146a and miR-10a can repress inflammation by tar￾geting several components (TRAF6/IRAK4) of the NF-κB pathway in ECs4
. MiR-92a promotes inflammation in 
ECs by targeting KLF2/KLF4, which inhibits the expression of NF-κB dependent vascular inflammatory genes5
. 
Additionally, miRNAs also directly target various adhesion molecules, playing anti-inflammatory roles in acti￾vated ECs, i.e., miR-31 targets SELE and miR-17-3p targets ICAM16,7. Moreover, numerous miRNAs involved 
in endothelial inflammation play critical roles in many major diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes8,9.

However because of the complexity of inflammatory genes and miRNAs, there would be lots of undiscovered 
miRNAs associated with endothelial inflammation. Therefore, further studies are needed to reveal more miRNAs 
and their associated mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response of endothelial cells.
The let-7 family is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans and can act as anti-inflammatory factors 
by targeting some pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., let-7d targets IL-13; let-7a targets IL-6)10,11, except for devel￾opment and tumor suppression. These molecules can also act as pro-inflammatory factors by targeting some 
anti-inflammatory factors, including IL-1012. In addition to the direct pro-inflammatory effects, let-7f can also 
indirectly play pro-inflammatory roles by targeting A20, a feedback inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway in mac￾rophages13. Additionally, the let-7 family is closely associated with endothelial function, including apoptosis, 
angiogenesis and the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition14,15. Let-7e is a member of the let-7 family and also 
a key regulator of endothelial function and inflammation. For example, let-7e regulates the migration and tube 
formation of endothelial progenitor cells via targeting FASLG16. Let-7e overexpression can activate Th1 and Th17 
cells and aggravate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Hashimoto’s disease by targeting IL-1017,18. 
Furthermore, let-7e expression is significantly increased in many cardiovascular diseases, including coronary 
heart disease19. Therefore, we speculated that let-7e might perform critical roles in the regulation of the inflamma￾tory responses of endothelial cells by directly or indirectly targeting certain inflammatory genes. However, studies 
of this hypothesis have not been reported until recently.
In the present study, we investigated the actions of let-7e in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
and found that let-7e could exacerbate the inflammatory responses of ECs by promoting NF-κB translocation 
into the nucleus and activation through ceRNA crosstalk, which was composed of lnc-MKI67IP-3, let-7e and its 
target IκBβ.
Results
Enrichment analysis and expression profiles of mRNAs/lncRNAs regulated by let-7e. Let-7e 
was abundantly expressed in endothelial cells at an expression level higher (86%) than that of U6. The Ct value 
of let-7e relative to U6 was −0.9. As an internal control, U6 expression was also confirmed in HUVECs through 
different treatments (Supplementary Figure S1a). To determine the effects of let-7e on the expression patterns of 
mRNAs/lncRNAs in ECs, HUVECs were transfected with a let-7e inhibitor/mimic at different concentrations. 
The overexpression and underexpression of let-7e and the expression changes of other let-7 family members 
were verified (Supplementary Figure S1b,c). The results of the microarray analysis showed that let-7e profoundly 
affected the expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs (Fig. 1a). As described in Methods section, 385 mRNAs poten￾tially targeted by let-7e and 102 lncRNAs potentially binding to let-7e were selected and hierarchically clustered 
(Fig. 1b and c). The gene set enrichment analysis of these 487 transcripts showed that let-7e was involved in many 
important biological processes and pathways, such as immune, inflammatory responses, cell proliferation and 
apoptosis, cell adhesion, and the VEGF and NF-κB/MAPK pathways (Fig. 1d).
Co-expression/correlation network potentially targeted by let-7e. The co-expression/correlation 
network was constructed based on the expression data from the above-mentioned 487 transcripts. Their corre￾lations were extremely complex and constituted a large and complex co-expression/correlation network with >
4100 edges (Fig. 2a). Then, the core nodes and subnetworks were selected as described in Methods. In the core 
subnetwork, most nodes were significantly co-expressed with IκBβ (|r|>​ 0.99 and p<​ 0.01) (Fig. 2b and c). Let-7e 
significantly down-regulated the expression of these molecules, while let-7e inhibitor had the opposite effects. 
Among these nodes, IκBβ and lnc-MKI67IP-3 were the most significantly regulated and their network connec￾tivity, correlation coefficients (p value) and binding energies to let-7e were also higher than most other nodes 
(Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table S1). The expression of some nodes (CCR5 and FOXO3A) was also compared to 
that of IκBβ and lnc-MKI67IP-3 in HUVECs (Supplementary Figure S1d).
Pro-inflammatory roles of let-7e in the inflammation of HUVECs. The microarray data suggested 
that let-7e could up-regulate the expression of many crucial pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules 
in HUVECs, such as IL-1B, IL-6, ICAM1, VCAM1, SELE and SELP, while let-7e inhibitor down-regulated these 
molecules (Fig. 3a). Moreover, most of these molecules were regulated through NF-κB. Several important inflam￾matory cytokines and adhesion molecules were further verified using qPCR and ELISA. The results showed that 
let-7e mimic could significantly increase their secretion and mRNA expression, while the effects of let-7e inhib￾itor were not significant (Fig. 3b and c). These results might reflect the fact that the NF-κB pathway was inactive 
and inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules were expressed at low basal level in resting endothelial cells, 
and let-7e inhibitor treatment was difficult to further significantly decrease their expression.
Let-7e exerted pro-inflammatory effects through targeting IκBβ and promoting NF-κB trans￾location. The above results implied that IκBβ might play crucial roles in the pro-inflammatory effects of 
let-7e. Moreover, let-7e mimic significantly reduced IκBβ expression, but let-7e inhibitor showed the opposite 
effects (Fig. 4a and b). The minimum free energy (MFE) between let-7e and the predicted binding site of let-7e in 
IκBβ 3′ UTR was −15.6kcal/mol (Fig. 4c), a value much lower than the experimentally confirmed MFEs between 
many miRNAs and their targets. For example, the MFE between miR-21 and its target PDCD4 is only −10 kcal/
mol20. The luciferase reporter assay also showed that let-7e mimic, but not the mimic negative control, signifi￾cantly reduced the relative luciferase activity in HUVECs transfected with Luc-IκBβ-WT. The luciferase activity 
in HUVECs transfected with Luc-IκBβ-Mut did not significantly change (Fig. 4d). These results indicated that 
IκBβ was the target of let-7e in HUVECs. Immunoblotting and cell immunofluorescence showed that let-7e sig￾nificantly increased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. IκBβ siRNA and/or let-7e had the same effects and also 
significantly down-regulated IκBβ (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Figure S1e). Moreover, compared with the control 

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
SCiEnTiFiC Reports | 7:42498 | DOI: 10.1038/srep42498 3
group, IκBβ siRNA and let-7e mimic significantly increased the expression and secretion of several important 
inflammation-associated molecules regulated by NF-κB. The IκBβ expression vector attenuated the above effects 
of let-7e mimic, and IκBβ siRNA further reinforced these effects (Fig. 4e–g). The primary function of IκBβ was to 
sequester NF-κB in the cytosol and inhibit the NF-κB pathway. In resting endothelial cells, NF-κB was primarily 
inactivated and almost all NF-κB were sequestered in the cytosol. Even IκBβ expression was further increased, 
and no additional NF-κB could be arrested in the cytoplasm and inhibited. Therefore, IκBβ expression vector 
treatment alone or combined with let-7e mimic NC had no significant effect on the nuclear translocation of 
NF-κB and expression/secretion of several inflammation-associated molecules (Fig. 4e–g).
Lnc-MKI67IP-3 inhibited the pro-inflammatory effects of let-7e by functioning as a ceRNA.
Lnc-MKI67IP-3 is located on chromosome 2 and its function has not been described thus far. The present study 
showed a strong correlation between lnc-MKI67IP-3 and let-7e or IκBβ. The predicted results indicated that 
let-7e could bind to lnc-MKI67IP-3. The MFE between let-7e and the let-7e binding site in lnc-MKI67IP-3 was −
17.8 kcal/mol (Fig. 5a). Luciferase reporter assay showed that only let-7e mimic significantly reduced the relative 
luciferase activity in HUVECs transfected with luc-lnc-MKI67IP-3-wt. The luciferase activity in other groups did 
not significantly change (Fig. 5b). This finding indicated that lnc-MKI67IP-3 could bind to let-7e and might act as 
a sponge to suppress the inhibitory effects of let-7e on its targets. Compared with the control group (transfection 
with empty vector), the lnc-MKI67IP-3-wt vector attenuated the let-7e-mediated inhibition of IκBβ expression 
and significantly increase the expression of IκBβ mRNA and protein. The lnc-MKI67IP-3-wt vector also attenu￾ated the let-7e-mediated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and secretion of numerous inflammatory molecules 
regulated through NF-κB (Fig. 6a–c). However, for the similar reasons mentioned in above section, lnc-MKI67IP￾3-wt vector treatment alone or combined with let-7e mimic NC had no significant effect on the nuclear trans￾location of NF-κB and secretion of several inflammatory molecules. Furthermore, the lnc-MKI67IP-3-mut 
vector (lacking let-7e binding site) and the mimic NC also had no significant effects (Fig. 6a–c). Moreover, let-7e 
mimic significantly down-regulated lnc-MKI67IP-3 expression, while let-7e inhibitor markedly up-regulated this

expression and let-7e inhibitor could be considered as an inducer of lnc-MKI67IP-3, just like vitamin C (Fig. 6d, 
Supplementary Figure S2a). At high concentration, let-7e inhibitor could completely reverse the effects of let-7e, 
namely increasing the expression of lnc-MKI67IP-3 and IkBβ (Supplementary Figure S2b and c). Lnc-MKI67IP-3 
and mature let-7e were primarily localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6e), suggesting that lnc-MKI67IP-3 could 
inhibit the pro-inflammatory effects of let-7e as a ceRNA through binding to let-7e in the cytoplasm.
Let-7e was up-regulated in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs and atherosclerotic plaques. Because 
of the instability of ox-LDL, its oxidation was confirmed prior to experiments (Supplementary Figure S6a). 
In HUVECs treated with ox-LDL for different times, ox-LDL significantly up-regulated let-7e and pri-let-7e 
expression, while the expression levels of IκBβ and lnc-MKI67IP-3 were significantly down-regulated (Fig. 7a, 
Supplementary Figure S6b). Although the effects of let-7e on apoptosis and proliferation were slight in HUVECs 
without ox-LDL treatment, let-7e mimic significantly further increased the apoptosis, proliferation inhibition, 
endothelial inflammation and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion induced by ox-LDL in HUVECs. However, 
the opposite effects of let-7e inhibitor were observed (Supplementary Figure S6c–f and S7a–e). Moreover,

the expression of let-7e, IκBβ and lnc-MKI67IP-3 in human atherosclerosis plaques was similar to that in 
oxLDL-treated HUVECs (Fig. 7b). These results indicated that the pro-inflammatory effects of let-7e via ceRNA 
crosstalk among lnc-MKI67IP-3, let-7e and IκBβ might play important roles in the inflammatory responses of 
endothelial cells induced by ox-LDL and atherosclerosis development.
Discussion
Noncoding transcripts (>200 nucleotides) are defined as lncRNAs. To date, thousands of putative lncR￾NAs have been described. However, the precise functions and mechanisms of these molecules remain elusive. 
Accumulated studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs could act as crucial regulators in various pathophysiolog￾ical processes. Particularly, some lncRNAs play essential roles in the regulation of endothelial cell function and 
inflammation. For example, some vascular-enriched lncRNAs, such as SENCR, MIR503HG, and HIF1A-AS1, 
regulated the proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis of HUVECs21–23. LncRNA MALAT1 could up-regulate 
pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and TNF-a) through SAA3 activation24. TUG1 could inhibit inflammatory 
responses as an anti-inflammatory mediator25. The present study revealed that lnc-MKI67IP-3 could also sup￾press let-7e-mediated inflammation in ECs. These findings suggest that lncRNA is a new class of inflammatory 
regulators in ECs, and more inflammation-associated lncRNAs should be discovered.
Many lncRNAs have miRNA recognition elements specific to certain miRNAs and can competitively inhibit 
the binding of miRNAs to their target genes, similar to miRNA sponges, and thus suppress their functions. 
This crosstalk between lncRNAs and miRNAs is called the ‘competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs)’ network 
and has been supported by numerous studies26. Many lncRNAs, acting as ceRNAs, have been identified, such 
as linc-MD1, H19, and lncRNA-BGL327–29. However, studies on how ceRNAs regulate endothelial function are 
still in their infancy. MALAT1 acts as a ceRNA that competes with miR-22–3p and protects the endothelium 
from ox-LDL-induced dysfunction30. MIAT sequesters miR-150-5p as a ceRNA and alleviates its repressive 
effect on VEGF expression, thereby regulating the proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells31. 
TGFB2-OT1 is involved in the autophagy and inflammation of vascular endothelial cells as a ceRNA by binding 
to miR-3960, miR-4488 and miR-4459, which targets CERS1, NAT8L, and LARP1, respectively32. The present 
study revealed that lnc-MKI67IP-3 antagonized the inhibitory effect of let-7e on its target IκBβ as a let-7e sponge, 
forming a ceRNA network comprising lnc-MKI67IP-3, let-7e and IκBβ. Meanwhile, let-7e could down-regulate

lnc-MKI67IP-3, enhancing the suppressive effect of let-7e on IκBβ and forming a positive feedback loop, promot￾ing the pro-inflammatory actions of let-7e.
NF-κB is one of the most important regulators of inflammation. Some miRNAs, such as miR-223, miR-15a and 
miR-16, play crucial roles in the regulation of NF-κB activity by targeting components of the NF-κB pathway33–35. 
Let-7 miRNAs (let-7a, let-7f and let-7e) could increase the activation of NF-κB by targeting TNFAIP3, an inhib￾itor of the NF-κB pathway, and augmenting the inflammatory response in HEK293T cells as pro-inflammatory 
mediators13,36. The present study showed that let-7e increased NF-κB activation and played pro-inflammatory 
roles in endothelial cells. However, a previous study reported that let-7 acts as an anti-inflammatory mediator 
by targeting IL-6 and suppressing NF-κB activation in breast cells37. This inconsistency might primarily reflect 
differences in cell lines (epithelial vs. endothelial cells). Moreover, the cell- and tissue-specificity in functions 
and targets of miRNAs is common, and effects of the same miRNA in different cell types may be completely 
opposite38. Compared to miRNAs, studies on how lncRNAs regulate NF-κB activity have only recently emerged. 
It is reported that Lethe, a pseudogene lncRNA, interacts with NF-κB p65 and inhibits its activity in embryonic 
fibroblast cells39. PACER can maintain the NF-κB-dependent transcription of COX-2 in macrophages40.
IκBβ is one member of the IκB family, which inhibits the NF-κB pathway by masking NF-κB nuclear locali￾zation signal and sequestering it in the cytosol41. The pro-inflammatory genes induced through IκBα-NFκB or 
IκBβ-NFκB signaling and the phosphorylation and degradation pathways of IκBβ and IκBα are not exactly the 
same42. The binding of IκBβ and subsequent inhibition of NF-κB dimers are more significant in resting cells41. 
Importantly, IkBα is rapidly degraded and resynthesized after cytokine stimulation. This negative feedback limits 
NF-κB activation in a transient manner. However, the degradation of IκBβ is slow after cytokine stimulation and 
it contributes to persistent NF-κB activation42. This indicates that IκBβ may play more important roles in the 
processes of low intensity, chronic and long-term inflammation, such as atherosclerosis. Currently, studies of 
ncRNAs that regulate IκBβ in endothelial cells have not yet been reported. The present study is the first report that 
let-7e inhibits target IκBβ expression through the synergistic suppression of ceRNA lnc-MKI67IP-3. Considering 
the functional features of IκBβ, these results suggested that let-7e might play key roles in the chronic low-grade 
inflammation of endothelial cells.
In summary, the present study demonstrated that by inhibiting the target gene IκBβ, a critical inhibitor of the 
NF-κB pathway, let-7e promoted the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation, enhancing inflammatory 
responses in ECs. In addition, as a ceRNA, lnc-MKI67IP-3 antagonized the inhibitory effect of let-7e on IκBβ. 
Moreover, let-7e down-regulated lnc-MKI67IP-3, forming a positive feedback loop to aggravate inflammation 
(Fig. 7c). Let-7e, lnc-MKI67IP-3 and IκBβ were also abnormal in oxLDL-treated HUVECs and atherosclerotic 
plaques, suggesting that let-7e might play important pro-inflammatory roles in the development of atherosclero￾sis. The present study revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for the NF-κB pathway through ceRNA crosstalk 
and provided new insight into the inflammatory response of endothelial cells.

Cell culture, vectors and treatment. HUVECs were purchased from American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC) and cultured in recommended conditions. Cells of the same batch were used in all experiments. SiRNA 
and pCMV6 vectors of IκBβ and wide/mutant lnc-MKI67IP-3 were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, 
China) or Origene (Rockville, USA). The mimic and inhibitor of let-7e and corresponding negative controls 
(NC) were bought from GenePharma. Vitamin C was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, USA). 
Human ox-LDL was purchased from Yiyuan Biotechnologies (Guangzhou, China) and it was prepared as previ￾ously described43. Oxidation of ox-LDL was confirmed by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CellBiolabs, USA). HUVECs were treated with ox-LDL (50υg/ml) 
or Vitamin C and then were harvested at 12, 24 and 48hours after treatment. The mimic/inhibitor/NC of let-7e, 
siRNA or different vectors, respectively, were transfected into HUVECs using lipofectamine RNAIMAX or 
3000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). HUVECs were harvested 24 hours after transfection for subsequent 
experiments.
RNA isolation, Microarray and Enrichment analysis. Total RNAs were isolated from HUVECs 
transfected with let-7e mimic or inhibitor and corresponding NC using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and 
quantified by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer and Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Their 
quality was also evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and all RNA samples had RNA integrity numbers ≥8. 
Then, they were labeled with cy3 and hybridized to Agilent human LncRNA 4×​ 180K microarray (CapitalBio, 
China). Expression data of mRNAs and lncRNAs were filtered and normalized (ArrayExpress accession num￾ber: E-MTAB-4971), and then the lncRNAs and mRNAs regulated by let-7e were identified using GeneSpring 
GX 11.5 (Agilent, CA). The functional enrichment analysis was carried out using the Database for Annotation, 
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7.
Prediction of potential targets of let-7e. Let-7e targets were predicated by Targetscan, MicroT-CDS and 
miRanda. The transcripts, which were oppositely expressed in let-7e mimic groups and let-7e inhibitor groups, 
were selected from the intersection of targets predicted by the above tools and they were regarded as potential 
targets of let-7e in HUVECs. The MFE of heteroduplex was calculated by RNA22 v2 to filter the binding sites of 
let-7e in the selected transcripts (positive threshold of MFE <−12Kcal/mol)44.
Figure 7. The ceRNA network comprising let-7e, IκBβ and lnc-MKI67IP-3 was abnormal in HUVECs 
treated with ox-LDL and atherosclerotic plaques. (a) HUVECs were treated with ox-LDL (50μg/ml) for 
12, 24 and 48hours. The expression of let-7e, lnc-MKI67IP-3 and IkBβ was detected using qPCR. Untreated 
HUVECs were used as controls. *P<0.05 vs. all other groups. ◆
P<0.05 vs. control and 12hours groups. (b) 
The expression of let-7e, IkBβ and lnc-MKI67IP-3 in human atherosclerotic plaques was detected using qPCR. 
Normal large arteries were used as controls. *P<0.05 vs. control group. Experiments were repeated three times 
independently. (c) The schematic diagram of the pro-inflammatory effects of let-7e via ceRNA crosstalk in 
vascular endothelial cells. The red color indicates up-regulation, while the blue color indicates down-regulation. 
The solid line represents direct regulation, while the dotted line represents an unknown/indirect regulation.

Construction and analysis of co-expression/correlation network. Based on the predicted targets 
of let-7e, the co-expression/correlation network of lncRNAs potentially binding to let-7e and mRNAs poten￾tially targeted by let-7e was constructed using CoExpress v1.5 (Pearson correlation coefficient >0.99, P<​ 0.05). 
The entire network was analyzed to find core subnetworks and nodes using two plugins of Cytoscape, namely 
ModuLand45 and MCODE46. The nodes/subnetworks in the intersection of the results of these two plugins were 
selected for further study as previously described47. The functions of lncRNAs were predicted according to their 
co-expressed mRNAs as previously described48,49. The functions of subnetworks were studied according to the 
functions of mRNAs and lncRNAs in corresponding networks and literature information.
Real-time PCR. Total RNAs were prepared and quantified. A part of them was reverse-transcribed using 
Universal cDNA Synthesis Kit II (Exiqon, Denmark) for real-time PCR using LNA-enhanced let-7e family prim￾ers sets (Exiqon, Denmark) and SYBR Green master mix (Takara, Japan). A part was used for examining the 
pri-let-7e expression using TaqMan Pri-miRNA primers and probes (Thermo Scientific, USA). U6 was used as 
an internal control of miRNAs. Another part was used for real-time PCR of mRNAs/lncRNAs using PrimeScript 
RT reagent Kit and SYBR Green Master Mix (Takara, Japan). β-actin was used as an internal control. PCR was 
performed using Bio-Rad iQ5 and primers were listed in Supplementary Table S2.
ELISA, Cell immunofluorescence and Western blot. Total, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were pre￾pared using ReadyPrep Protein Extraction Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and aliquots of them were used for west￾ern blot analysis with antibodies to IκBβ, RELA, H3 and β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The immunoreactive 
bands were detected by ECL kit and visualized with ImageQuant LAS 4000. The collected culture medium was 
used for the assay of ICAM1, VCAM1, SELE, SELP and IL-6 by ELISA kits (Abcam, Inc.). HUVECs were cultured 
on slides in 6-wells plates and transfected with let-7e mimic and negative control as above mentioned. Then, 
cell immunofluorescence assay was performed using anti-NF-κB mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Cell 
Signaling Technology, USA) and Alexa Fluor 594-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson, 
US) as described previously50. DAPI (6-diamidino-2- phenylindole, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used to stain the 
nuclear. The slides were observed under LSM 710 laser confocal microscope and analyzed using ZEN software 
(Zeiss, Germany).
Luciferase reporter assay, cell adhesion assay and cell apoptosis/proliferation assay. The lucif￾erase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning the target/binding sequence (or their mutants) of let-7e in Iκ
Bβ 3′-UTR or lnc-MKI67IP-3 into pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA target expression vector (Promega, USA). 
HUVECs, respectively, were transfected with these vectors and let-7e mimic/inhibitor or corresponding NC. The 
firefly and renilla luciferase activity of cell lysates was assayed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The 
relative luciferase activity of each group was calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The adhe￾sion of monocyte (THP-1) to endothelial cell (HUVECs) was assayed as described previously51. The apoptosis was 
analyzed using Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, USA). The cell proliferation was assayed using 
the viable cell count method with staining by Calcein-AM (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Statistical Analysis. P values in multiple testing were calibrated using Benjamini–Hochberg correction. 
Person correlation coefficients and p values were calculated using house-made scripts. Data were presented as 
mean+​ SEM and compared using two-tailed Student’s t-tests or one-way analysis of variance with appropriate 
post-tests. P<​ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. R package was used for all calculations. All experi￾ments in this study were repeated at least three times independently.
