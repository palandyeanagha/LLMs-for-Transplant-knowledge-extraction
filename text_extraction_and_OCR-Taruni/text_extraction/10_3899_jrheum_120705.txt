Association of Gastroesophageal Factors and Worsening
of Forced Vital Capacity in Systemic Sclerosis
Xuli Jerry Zhang, Ashley Bonner, Marie Hudson, the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group,

ABSTRACT. Objective. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and
causes death. Once lung fibrosis occurs, disease course may become stable or decline. Little is
known about risks for progression. We studied SSc–gastroesophageal (GE) involvement in relation
to worsening forced vital capacity (FVC) on pulmonary function tests (PFT) to investigate whether
it was related to progression. Our objective was to determine whether GE reflux and dysphagia are
associated with progressive moderate/severe ILD as measured by PFT over 3 years.
Methods. The Canadian Scleroderma Research Group is a multicenter SSc database that collects
data annually. Using indicators of GE involvement and annual PFT, comparisons were made
between no/mild ILD, stable moderate/severe ILD, and progressive moderate/severe ILD groups
based on changes of FVC. Multivariate analyses determined associations between GE factors and
ILD development and progression.
Results. There were 1043 patients with SSc (mean age 55.7 yrs, mean disease duration 10.8 yrs);
one-quarter had pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiograph that was related to FVC percentage
predicted (Spearman’s rho –0.39; p < 0.01). Physician indicators such as esophageal dysmotility 
(p = 0.009) and postesophageal dilatation (p = 0.041), and patient indicators such as difficulty
swallowing (p = 0.016) and waking up choking (p = 0.026) were associated with low FVC. In
comparing progressive and stable moderate/severe FVC (< 70% predicted), early satiety (p = 0.018)
and a combination term of postdilatation and choking (p = 0.042) increased risk of progression of
ILD. Topoisomerase I was not associated with progression over followup.
Conclusion. Symptoms of esophageal dysmotility were associated with worsening FVC in SSc,
especially if both need for esophageal dilatation and choking were present. (First Release April 1

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem disease charac￾terized by chronic inflammation, vascular abnormalities,
and fibrosis in the skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
heart and lungs1,2,3. There are 2 main subtypes: limited
cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) and diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc)4.
Internal organ involvement (such as pulmonary fibrosis,
renal crisis, and cardiomyopathy) is increased in dcSSc; and
with earlier and more serious organ involvement5. In
contrast, Raynaud phenomenon (RP) and GI involvement
[gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal
dysmotility] are frequent in both subsets6,7.
Fibrosis of lung parenchyma results in restrictive inter￾stitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), and is a leading contributor to
mortality8,9,10,11; about 40% of cases of dcSSc have
pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiograph and 17% of lcSSc12.
Not all patients experience the same disease trajectory for
SSc-ILD; some progress to endstage pulmonary fibrosis,
others stabilize3. Clinical features associated with devel￾opment of SSc-related ILD include topoisomerase I
antibody (topo I or Scl70), dcSSc subset, elevated
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and digital ulcera￾tions3,5,12. Recently, topo I was shown to be predictive of
lung function decline in SSc as measured by forced vital
capacity (FVC)13. Within the first 3 years from disease
onset, FVC% predicted was associated with later deterio￾ration14. FVC may be related to conditions other than
parenchymal disease including respiratory muscle
weakness, scleroderma skin involvement of the thorax in the
dcSSc subset, and poor performance on pulmonary function
testing (PFT).

Zhang, et al: GERD and FVC in SSc 851
Esophageal dysmotility and GERD may contribute to the
development and exacerbation of SSc-ILD through
microaspiration15,16,17,18,19. However, not all studies
agree20. Studying the relationship between esophageal
involvement and restriction on PFT is of interest because
esophageal involvement is a common manifestation of SSc,
affecting 50%–90% of cases, but is not severe in all21,22,23.
Potential treatments exist to prevent severe reflux and
aspiration, so determining whether there is an association
between dysphagia and/or GERD and SSc-ILD is important.
The objective of our study was to determine whether
GERD and dysphagia are associated with progressive
moderate/severe FVC changes as measured over 3 years.
This change in FVC could be a surrogate for pulmonary
fibrosis (restrictive lung disease), but is not specific for
pulmonary fibrosis/ILD because low FVC is nonspecific,
particularly in SSc, where other extraparenchymal problems
can be present.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Canadian Scleroderma Research Group (CSRG) comprises 15 sites
that enroll adult patients with SSc (both prevalent and incident). Enrollment
requires a diagnosis of SSc by a rheumatologist (about 90% meet the
preliminary American College of Rheumatology criteria and some with
lcSSc do not)1,4,24. All sites have approval of their institutional review
board, with written informed consent from all participants. Patients are
followed annually with a history (including need for esophageal dilatation,
GERD medications, smoking status, and several GI questions), exami￾nation [including modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS)], and routine inves￾tigations (including annual PFT).
The CSRG has data for 1043 patients. Inclusion criteria for this study
required that patients had ≥ 3 consecutive annual visits with available
annual PFT for > 3 visits. FVC was used as an indicator of ILD severity or
a restrictive defect of pulmonary function, while changes in FVC were used
to reflect progression/stability3. Patients were organized into 3 groups
according to FVC severity: those with no/mild reduction in FVC at baseline
and followup (Group 1: FVC% predicted ≥ 70%); those with stable
moderate/severe FVC (Group 2: FVC% predicted < 70% with a decrease in
lung function of < 5% between any 2 consecutive visits or an overall net
decrease of < 3% over the 2 years); and those with progressive
moderate/severe FVC (Group 3: FVC% predicted < 70%, with a decrease
in lung function ≥ 5% over any 2 consecutive visits and an overall decrease
≥ 3% over the 2 years). If patients satisfied these definitions over > 1
consecutive 3-visit period, the period in which there was the greatest drop
in FVC between 3 consecutive visits was chosen.
Because restrictive lung disease is not an either-or condition but exists
on a spectrum, we wanted to confirm that there was sufficient contrast
between those whom we defined to have PFT restriction and those who did
not. We used a cutoff of FVC% predicted above 70% to define the group
with no/mild restriction (Group 1) and those with moderate/severe
restriction (Groups 2 and 3)3,14,25,26 to establish contrast between no/mild
restriction and moderate/severe restriction for binary comparisons. For
progression of ILD, a 5% decrease in FVC% predicted between 2 consecu￾tive visits and/or a 3% overall drop over 3 years was considered important.
We chose a decrease of 5% as it represents a relative decrease of 7% for
patients with baseline FVC% predicted of 70%, and a 10% change if
baseline FVC% predicted was 50%. Within the scleroderma lung study of
active ILD, the mean change in placebo in FVC over 1 year was < 3%, so
the feasibility of a study with a larger decrease and having an adequate
sample size was unlikely27. The 5% change for Groups 2 and 3 was greater
than the within-patient measurement error for FVC. A net decrease of 3%
between visits 1 and 3 was required to ensure that Groups 2 and 3 repre￾sented progressive moderate/severe restriction, so if someone had a
decrease in FVC% predicted of 6% at one visit and then increased by 8%
at the next visit, they would not be included in the group having progressive
moderate/severe ILD.
Several indicators of gastroesophageal (GE) involvement were
recorded, including the results of procedures and physician and patient
completion of case report forms. Physicians were asked annually to
indicate whether the patient experienced esophageal dysmotility (ever at
baseline visit; and within the last month on subsequent followup visits), and
if an esophageal dilatation had occurred. Esophageal dysmotility in SSc is
defined as food sticking in the retrosternal area and/or lack of coordinated
swallowing. Patients were asked annually using a standardized question￾naire if they experienced esophageal dysmotility and/or GERD (if ever at
baseline visit; and within the last month for followups); if they had diffi￾culty swallowing, had regurgitation of food or acid-tasting liquid into the
mouth or nose (food/acid reflux), had burning feeling rising from stomach
or lower chest toward the neck on most days (pyrosis), had woken up at
night choking, and feeling full shortly after starting a meal on most days
(early satiety). The GE variables were divided into dysmotility and
indicators of GERD. Dysmotility indicators included esophageal
dysmotility from the physician questionnaire forms, and difficulty
swallowing and early satiety from the patient forms. GERD was defined
from the patient forms giving the answer “yes” to food/acid regurgitation,
burning feeling rising from stomach, and/or waking up choking at night
from GERD. Esophageal dilatation suggested dysmotility and GERD. This
questionnaire was not externally validated but was applied at each annual
visit.
The first non-RP SSc symptoms/signs were recorded for each patient,
using a standardized questionnaire completed by the physician at the initial
CSRG visit. This was included to determine how often the GI symptoms
predated the respiratory symptoms.
Statistical analyses. Spearman correlations between FVC and chest
radiograph and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) evidence of
pulmonary fibrosis/ILD were performed for FVC% predicted as a
continuous and also a dichotomous variable to determine how consistent
FVC was as a surrogate of ILD.
Univariate analyses were first performed for patients in 3 separate
groups: no/mild FVC (n = 967) versus stable moderate/severe FVC (n = 56)
versus progressive moderate/severe FVC (n = 20); and then in binary
groupings: no/mild FVC (n = 967) versus moderate/severe FVC (n = 76)
and stable moderate/severe FVC (n = 56) versus progressive moderate/
severe FVC (n = 20).
The following demographic and other SSc-related factors were also
included in the univariate analysis: age, sex, ethnicity (aboriginal/white),
smoking history, disease subtype and disease duration, history of digital
ulcers, calcinosis, RP, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia, pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH; defined by physician), ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP),
topo I, anticentromere antibody (ACA), RNA polymerase III, anti-Ro52,
anti-La, and anti-PM Scl. Many of these have been associated with either
development or protective factors in ILD3,5,12.
Variables that had a p value < 0.1 in univariate analysis were retained
for regression models. Logistic regression models were developed, as
follows: esophageal dilatation (Model 1), physician indicated esophageal
dysmotility (Model 2), difficulty swallowing (Model 3), choking at night
(Model 4), burning feeling rising from stomach on most days (Model 5),
food/acid regurgitation on most days (Model 6), and early satiety (Model
7); and with an interaction term composed of dilatation*choking (Model 8)
and difficulty swallowing*choking (Model 9). Eighteen models were
developed in total, 9 comparing no/mild ILD versus progressive
moderate/severe ILD, and 9 comparing stable moderate/severe ILD versus
progressive moderate/severe ILD progression. If there were insufficient
numbers in each subset of the variables then the regression was not
performed. A list of strong covariates was generated through a backward
stepwise process. A subset analysis was performed on patients with disease

duration up to 5 years. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS, version 19.
Exploratory analyses were performed between worsening FVC and
other features that developed or worsened (ever or new-onset scleroderma
renal crisis, mRSS, and changes in skin score, inflammatory arthritis, and
myositis).
RESULTS
Baseline data for the study group (n = 1043) are shown in
Table 1: 92.7% represented no/mild FVC (Group 1), 5.4%
were stable moderate/severe FVC (Group 2), and 1.9% were
progressive moderate/severe FVC (Group 3). With respect
to GI symptoms, 84.2% had esophageal dysmotility
(physician-reported), 54.5% reported food/acid reflux on
most days, and 13.1% had undergone esophageal dilatation
(Table 1).
At each annual visit, 22% to 29% of patients had chest
radiograph changes compatible with pulmonary fibrosis/ILD
with a Spearman correlation of –0.39 comparing
radiographic evidence of ILD/pulmonary fibrosis and
FVC% predicted as a continuous variable (p < 0.01), with

similar significant results using a dichotomous FVC%
predicted of ≥ 70% or < 70%. There were only at most 230
patients who had an HRCT scan at any visit, so the numbers
were small. In those who had HRCT results, 80% to 90%
demonstrated ILD or pulmonary fibrosis. However, we
cannot assume that those without HRCT scanning did not
have ILD. The correlation between HRCT evidence of
pulmonary fibrosis and FVC% predicted at the baseline visit
was also significant (p < 0.01).
In the cohort, 5.6% had an elevated creatine kinase (CK)
above the upper limit of normal; 5.7% had proximal
weakness. Only 1.4% had both proximal muscle weakness
and elevated CK (defined as CK > 200 U/l in females or >
250 U/l in males). Also, 6.6% had an mRSS of 0 (at cohort
entry), which could have been due to skin regression at
cohort entry in patients with longstanding disease and less
commonly from SSc without skin involvement.
Univariate analysis. No/mild FVC restriction versus stable
moderate/severe FVC restriction versus progressive moderate/
severe FVC restriction. Initial univariate analysis (at p < 0.1)
included variables similar to those above (Table 1).
No/mild FVC restriction versus FVC restriction. Subsequent
univariate analysis merged the 3 groups in a comparison of
no/mild FVC restriction versus the stable or progressive
disease groups (Table 2). Differences included esophageal
dysmotility (p = 0.007), esophageal dilatation (p = 0.077),
difficulty swallowing (p = 0.038), and choking at night from
GERD (p = 0.049; more in those with FVC% predicted <
70%). Other SSc manifestations of calcinosis, digital ulcers
(p = 0.010), and PAH (p = 0.003) were also significantly
associated with low FVC. As expected, ESR (p = 0.011),
CRP (p = 0.010), and topo I (p = 0.037) were more common
in those with low FVC and ACA was less common (p =
0.01). There were no statistically significant associations
between other antibodies (RNA polymerase III, anti-Ro52,
anti-La, and anti-PM-Scl) and FVC.
Stable versus progressive moderate/severe FVC restriction.
Patient-reported food/acid regurgitation (p = 0.086), pyrosis
(heartburn; p = 0.032), and early satiety (p = 0.043) were
more common in those with progressive moderate/severe
FVC restriction. Analysis of other factors revealed that age
(increased; p = 0.002) and telangiectasia (protective; p =
0.036) were significantly different between the 2 groups
(Table 2).
Multivariate analysis. No/mild FVC restriction versus
FVC% predicted < 70%. The strongest associations with a
low FVC in different models were esophageal dilatation 
(p = 0.041), dysmotility (p = 0.009), difficulty swallowing
(p = 0.016), and choking at night (p = 0.026), increasing the
likelihood of a low FVC < 70% predicted by 2-fold, except
for the OR for dysmotility, which was even higher (> 6).
Data are shown in Table 3.
Stable versus progressive moderate/severe FVC restriction.
Early satiety was associated with progressive moderate/
severe reduction in FVC (OR 4.6, p = 0.018), heartburn (OR
2.7, p = 0.098), and GERD (OR 3.0, p = 0.072) were
increased in progressive moderate/severe FVC restriction.
Esophageal dilatation and difficulty swallowing were not
significant (Table 3). An interaction was studied where the
combination of dilatation and choking increased risk of
worsening FVC (p = 0.042). Table 4 summarizes the associ￾ations found between GI signs and symptoms and FVC in
SSc.
Table 5 summarizes the first non-RP manifestation at
cohort entry. Many patients had > 1 symptom/sign, so the
frequency of features is > 100%. Only 7.8% had respiratory
symptoms recorded as the first non-RP manifestation,
whereas one-quarter had complaints of heartburn or
dysphagia. 
Exploratory analyses for the association between FVC
and worsening organ involvement were limited because of
the small numbers of patients in this cohort who had
new-onset or worsening other organ involvement over the 3
years of followup in the cohort that had primarily long
disease duration. For instance, at enrollment 4.3% had ever
had scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) and only about 1%
annually had new or recurrent SRC. The skin score was
mostly stable over time (median change in mRSS was 0,
interquartile range –2 to +3) and the mean change in mRSS
was 0.05 to 0.31 in the first 4 years after enrollment.
Prevalence of inflammatory arthritis and myositis decreased
slightly over followup. Thus analyses between FVC and
organ involvement were not performed.
DISCUSSION
In our study, there appears to be a relationship between
gastroesophageal severity (need for dilatation and more
significant symptoms) and FVC restriction versus no/mild
FVC restriction and also with progressive moderate/severe
FVC restriction. It is not surprising that choking, esophageal
dysmotility, and need for esophageal dilatation were
associated with a low FVC and often with progressive
moderate/severe FVC restriction, because this has been
reported previously with ILD and PFT, but often with small
numbers of cases or in cross-sectional studies. Thirteen
patients with SSc were assessed using pH monitoring (for
GERD severity scores), esophageal endoscopy, and PFT,
where GERD scores were correlated with impaired
DLCO18. By means of manometry in 43 patients,
esophageal dysmotility was related to decreased lung
volumes and DLCO (i.e., ILD)16. In 133 patients with SSc,
ILD occurred in more patients with severe esophageal
dysmotility19. Although no causative association has been
established between esophageal and pulmonary involve￾ment16,19,28, the hypothesis is that tracheobronchial
aspiration of gastric secretions over time leads to pulmonary
fibrosis15,18,29. A rodent model, with recurrent gastric fluid

added to rodent lungs, demonstrated inflammatory cells and
cytokines in the lungs, suggesting that GERD and aspiration
trigger inflammatory responses leading to pulmonary
fibrosis30.
Comparison of normal FVC to restricted FVC resulted in
associations as described previously: PAH, elevated ESR,
negative ACA, and digital ulcers. PAH is a known compli￾cation of ILD31. An elevated ESR may be from inflam￾matory alveolitis, which can result in pulmonary interstitial
fibrosis3. A positive ACA was reduced by half in those with
low FVC compared to those without low FVC.
ACA-positive patients are a different phenotype of SSc3,5,10.
Perhaps one should treat SSc esophageal involvement
more aggressively in cases of progressive moderate/severe
FVC. A higher prevalence and degree of ILD changes on
HRCT has been associated with more severe dysmotility
and decline of DLCO and FVC over 2 years17. We found
that patient-reported early satiety (gastroparesis) increased
the risk of progressive moderate/severe FVC restriction
4-fold. Early satiety shares the same cholinergic neuropathy

Zhang, et al: GERD and FVC in SSc 855
as esophageal dysmotility15,32. Increased age was slightly
associated (OR 1.07) with progressive moderate/severe
FVC restriction, whereas it was previously thought not to
predict progression of ILD3. Telangiectasias were associated
less in those with low FVC, as expected, because telangiec￾tasias occur more frequently in cases of lcSSc or the CREST
phenotype (calcinosis, RP, esophageal dysmotility, sclero￾dactyly, telangiectasias)3,5; whereas dcSSc has more
likelihood of restrictive defects due to ILD and other
extrinsic problems including chest wall fibrosis and respi￾ratory muscle weakness.
The dynamic lung compliance in patients who had both
impaired peristalsis and esophageal sphincter function was
lower than in those with only 1 problem33. Combining
esophageal dilatation and choking at night yielded the
highest association in progressive moderate/severe ILD (OR
29). This seems plausible considering that patients with SSc
who undergo esophageal dilatation usually do so to relieve
esophageal stricture formation from recurrent GERD and
dysmotility. Reduced lower esophageal sphincter tone and
esophageal hypomotility result from cholinergic neurotrans￾mission abnormalities32, prolonging acid clearance34 and
result in severe GERD. However, an esophageal stricture
may reduce GERD symptoms, with worsening post￾dilatation. Our results agree with previous reports corre￾lating GERD and progression of ILD16,17,18,19,35,36,37. In
contrast, 2 studies have not shown this association20,38. One
study showed that a significant drop of FVC (10%–20%)
was associated with esophageal manometry only in the
dcSSc subset, but that study had only 105 patients. Use of
proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may have influenced the effect
of GERD on worsening FVC%20.
Our results must be interpreted with caution because
many objective measures for lung and esophageal changes
were not routinely performed. CSRG patients have tests that
are ordered according to the physicians, except for annual
echocardiogram, laboratory investigations, PFT, and chest
radiographs. Although PFT are suggestive of ILD, HRCT
data could help to support our hypothesis (that a decline in
FVC% predicted is associated with GERD and/or
dysmotility), but only a quarter of the patients had HRCT
scans recorded. Other studies have used FVC below a
certain percentage of predicted to measure changes in SSc
lung function over time, including the Scleroderma Lung
Study of cyclophosphamide versus placebo in SSc patients
with ILD27, but this was only after confirmation of

ILD/pulmonary fibrosis by HRCT scanning. The CSRG
study lacks the rigor of a clinical trial where HRCT scanning
was not mandatory. We did find a modest correlation
between pulmonary fibrosis/ILD on chest imaging (chest
radiograph and HRCT) and low FVC. DLCO% predicted
was not used in our study because many patients were at risk
for PAH and pulmonary hypertension (PH) where the
DLCO could decline in PH or ILD. Many patients with SSc
do not need manometry because the history is usually suffi￾cient to determine whether esophageal dysmotility is absent,
mild, moderate, or severe. Whereas for GI involvement,
objective signs were limited in this study to the need for an
esophageal dilatation, because the results of upper
endoscopy and manometry were not recorded in the
database. Because of a lack of rigorous objective measures,
there is certainly misclassification of patients as having ILD
if only FVC is used as a surrogate for ILD. However,
misclassification would bias the results in the negative
direction, i.e., with less likelihood of positive results if the
complications (GI and/or ILD changes) were not present in
some patients who were classified as having organ
involvement. Also, the majority of patients were using PPI
for a long time prior to our study, so we could not discern
whether the addition of or use of a PPI was protective
against progression of ILD. Indeed, use of a PPI especially
at high dose was associated with GERD (i.e., more severe
GERD received more treatment in general). A study would
need to follow an incident SSc cohort to determine whether
PPI and other antireflux treatment would potentially reduce
progression of ILD. We could not study changes in skin
score and PFT changes because this was a mostly prevalent
cohort, with long disease duration and stable skin scores. In
early dcSSc, one could expect to see worsening ILD and
worsening skin changes, but the association likely does not
persist in long disease duration SSc and worsening ILD.
The strengths of our study include a large sample size
(even though many did not progress; larger than previous
studies in progressive moderate/severe restrictive changes
on PFT), prospective serial observations including serial
PFT over 3 annual visits, very few missing data, and quality
control within the database. A weakness is that many had
long disease duration, which may not reflect the early
progressive moderate/severe FVC changes that occur in the
first 5 years, and patients with progressive disease were

Zhang, et al: GERD and FVC in SSc 857
uncommon, so a stricter definition of FVC changes lacked
power to adjust for all important confounders. Long disease
duration gives a survival bias, but many patients who die
from SSc-related pulmonary fibrosis do not die until after 5
years of disease even though ILD begins earlier. In SSc lung
studies, most do not progress over 1 to 2 years and thus the
small proportion of those with rapid progression over 3
annual visits is not unexpected. Topoisomerase I was
associated with FVC restriction versus FVC% predicted >
70%, but not with progression over the 3 years of observa￾tions. The risks of a low FVC and of further FVC
progression are not identical. Multiple testing occurred, but
we had predetermined study questions and other secondary
analyses, so a Bonferroni correction was not performed.
Although the groups had arbitrary definitions, our
hypothesis was that progressive moderate/severe FVC
restriction would have more significant upper GI
involvement, which would predispose to aspiration and
hence worsening restrictive pattern on PFT testing, so the
analyses were hypothesis-driven. The strongest effect was
with both choking/dysphagia and esophageal dilatation,
which has face validity for risk of aspiration. Depending on
the models the results were similar but not identical. All PFT
laboratories were certified but there was no standardization
between sites. However, most patients had all sets of PFT
performed at the same laboratory, so the within-individual
variation should be minimized. The percentage predicted
FVC change varied for absolute changes, with more
worsening in the lower FVC range. We did not study DLCO
changes, because they could reflect PAH. It is unclear
whether the association between the severity of esophageal
involvement and pulmonary fibrosis is causative19,39, or if
the simultaneous development of esophageal and pulmonary
involvement is simply a reflection of more generalized
fibrosis15,16. An incident SSc study prior to ILD would help
answer this question. It would be interesting to investigate
whether promotility and gastroprotective medications
decrease progression of ILD. The University of California,
Los Angeles, Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium
Gastrointestinal Tract questionnaire40 was not published at
the start of the CSRG study, so it was unavailable. Use of a
validated GI questionnaire would presumably find similar
results, because the questionnaire our patients completed
had similar domains. However, lack of a validated question￾naire for the GI questions and the lack of rigor for
performing GI tests may be important limitations.
Esophageal dysmotility and GERD appear to be
associated with low FVC in SSc, and some upper GI signs
and symptoms occur more frequently in progressive
moderate/severe FVC restriction. The presence of both
severe dysmotility and GERD was strongly associated with
reduction of progressive moderate/severe FVC. Because
this was mostly a prevalent cohort, we could not study
patients at the initial onset of GI symptoms and then
determine whether there were more severe complaints in
those who subsequently developed ILD or worsening FVC.
However, some GI symptoms are associated with restrictive
changes of pulmonary function and worsening FVC.
