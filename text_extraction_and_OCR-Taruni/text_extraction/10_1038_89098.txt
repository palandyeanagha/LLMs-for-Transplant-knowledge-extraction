The Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae subfamilies of the
Paramyxoviridae family include several major pathogens of hu￾mans and animals. The Pneumovirinae are taxonomically divided
in the Pneumovirus and the Metapneumovirus genera1
. Human res￾piratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the type species of the
Pneumovirus genus, is the single most important cause of lower
respiratory tract infections (RTIs) during infancy and early child￾hood worldwide2,3. Other members of the Pneumovirus genus in￾clude bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV), ovine respiratory
syncytial virus (oRSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM).
Avian pneumovirus (APV), previously known as turkey rhinotra￾cheitis virus (TRTV), is the etiological agent of an upper RTI of
turkeys4,5 and the sole member of the recently assigned
Metapneumovirus genus1
. Until now, metapneumoviruses have
not been associated with infections or disease in mammals. The
classification of the two genera is based primarily on their gene
constellation; metapneumoviruses lack non-structural proteins
NS1 and NS2 and the gene order is different from that of pneu￾moviruses (RSV, 3′-NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L-5′; APV, 3′-N￾P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5′)
6–8.
In the past few decades, many etiological agents of respiratory
tract illnesses (RTI) have been identified9,10. However, a propor￾tion of these illnesses still cannot be attributed to known
pathogens. We have now isolated a previously undiscovered
paramyxovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken
from 28 epidemiologically unrelated children in the Netherlands
suffering from RTI during the past 20 years. Of the patients, 27
were below the age of 5 years and 13 of these were infants be￾tween the ages of 0 and 12 months. The clinical symptoms of
these children were largely similar to the RTI caused by hRSV,
ranging from mild respiratory problems to severe cough, bron￾chiolitis and pneumonia, often accompanied by high fever,
myalgia and vomiting. Some of these patients were hospitalized
and needed mechanical ventilation.
The virus isolates exhibited a paramyxovirus-like morphology
in negative contrast electron microscopy and were closely re￾lated both antigenically and genetically. Based on sequence ho￾mology and gene constellation, the viruses seemed to be a tenta￾tive new member of the Metapneumovirus genus that we have
provisionally named human metapneumovirus (hMPV).
Serological surveys showed that by the age of five years virtually
all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to hMPV and
that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least half a
century.
Virus isolation and characterization
Within our diagnostic virology setting, we isolated 28 unidenti￾fiable viruses from patients in the Netherlands with RTI over the
past 20 years. Of the 26 patients for whom personal information
was available, eight (31%) were females, 13 (50%) were between
the ages of 0 and 12 months, and 12 (46 %) were between the
ages of 1 and 5 years. All viruses were isolated from samples col￾lected in the winter months. The unidentified virus isolates
replicated slowly in tertiary monkey kidney (tMK) cells, very
poorly in Vero cells and A549 cells, and could not be propagated
in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or chicken embryo
fibroblasts (CEF). The cytopathic effects induced by these virus
isolates were virtually indistinguishable from those caused by
hRSV, with characteristic syncytia formation followed by rapid
internal disruption of the cells and subsequent detachment from
the culture plate. The cells usually displayed cytopathic effects at
days 10–14 post inoculation, slightly later than the cytopathic
effects induced by hRSV-containing specimens (data not
shown). After 14 days of virus propagation, the viral titers in the
cultures were on average 10,000 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infec￾tious doses) per ml. Supernatants of infected tMK cells were used
for electron microscopy analysis, which revealed the presence of
paramyxovirus-like pleiomorphic particles in the range of
150–600 nm, with short envelope projections in the range of
13–17 nm (Fig. 1). Similar to some other paramyxoviruses such
as selected hRSV and parainfluenza virus isolates, nucleocapsids
were rarely observed.

From 28 young children in the Netherlands, we isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a
tentative new member of the Metapneumovirus genus based on virological data, sequence ho￾mology and gene constellation. Previously, avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this re￾cently assigned genus, hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus: human
metapneumovirus. The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were
similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection, ranging from upper respi￾ratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by
the age of five years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human
metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.

ment11 resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction of the TCID50 for tMK
cells. Virus-infected tMK cell-culture supernatants did not dis￾play hemagglutinating activity with turkey, chicken or guinea
pig erythrocytes. In tMK-cell cultures, virus replication was
found to be dependent on trypsin. These combined virological
data indicated that the newly identified virus is a member of the
Paramyxoviridae family.
We isolated RNA from the supernatant of tMK cells infected
with 15 of the unidentified virus isolates for reverse transcrip￾tion (RT)-PCR analyses using primer sets specific for known
paramyxoviruses (human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) types 1–4,
mumps virus, measles virus, hRSV, simian virus type 5 (SV-5),
Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)). We carried out
RT-PCR assays at low stringency in order to detect potentially re￾lated viruses and used RNA isolated from homologous virus
stocks as positive controls. Whereas the controls all reacted posi￾tive with the respective virus-specific primers, the newly identi￾fied virus isolates did not (data not shown), indicating the virus
was not closely related to the viruses for which primer sets had
been selected.
We next inoculated ferrets and guinea pigs intranasally with
two of the virus isolates (without prior purification) to raise
virus-specific antisera. The animals did not display any clinical
symptoms. The antisera did not react in immune fluorescence
assays (IFA) with cells infected with a panel of paramyxoviruses
and orthomyxoviruses (hPIV types 1–4, hRSV, influenza virus
type A and B). All animals seroconverted as shown in virus neu￾tralization assays and IFA against the homologous viruses. We
next tested the 28 unidentified virus isolates with the guinea pig
and ferret pre- and post-infection sera. tMK cell cultures infected
with each of the 28 virus isolates reacted positively in IFA with
the post-infection animal sera, indicating that they were serolog￾ically related or identical.
RAP-PCR
To obtain sequence information on the unknown virus isolates,
we used a random PCR amplification strategy known as RAP￾PCR (refs. 12,13). To this end, we infected tMK cells with one of
the virus isolates (isolate 00-1) or with hPIV-1 that served as a
control. We sequenced 20 differentially displayed bands specific
for the unidentified virus. When we used the deduced amino￾acid sequences to search for homologies against sequences in the
Genbank database using the BLAST software
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST), 10 of 20 fragments displayed
resemblance to APV/TRTV sequences. These 10 fragments were
located in the genes coding for the nucleoprotein (N; fragments
1 and 2), the matrix protein (M; fragment 3), the fusion protein
(F; fragments 4, 5, 6 and 7) and the polymerase protein (L; frag￾ments 8, 9 and 10) (Fig. 2). We can exclude the possibility of con￾tamination of the human samples with APV/TRTV as we do not
have this virus in our laboratories. We next designed PCR
primers to complete the sequence information for the 3′ end of
the viral genome based on our RAP-PCR fragments as well as
published leader and trailer sequences for the Pneumovirinae7
(Fig. 2). In total, we have generated 5.7 kilobases of sequence in￾formation of the viral genome. Analyses of the sequences of
these fragments revealed the absence of NS1 and NS2 open read￾ing frames (ORFs) at the extreme 3′ end of the viral genome (Fig.
3a) and positioning of the putative F ORF immediately adjacent
to the putative M ORF (Fig. 3b). This genomic organization re￾sembles that of the metapneumovirus APV, which is consistent
with the sequence homology. It should be noted however that
the genomic organization of hMPV cannot be simply deduced
from that of APV, and requires further analysis.
The translated sequences for the N, P, M and F ORFs were
aligned with the amino-acid sequences of hRSV and APV (Fig.
3c–f). For N, these alignments revealed a 20% homology with
hRSV and 52% homology with APV. The amino-acid sequences
for P revealed 25% homology with hRSV and 67% with APV; for
M, 37% with hRSV and 87% with APV; and for F, 32% with hRSV
and 80% homology with APV.
Phylogeny
As an indicator for the relationship between the newly identified
virus isolates and members of the Pneumovirinae, phylogenetic
trees were constructed based on the N, P, M and F ORFs of these
viruses. In all four phylogenetic trees, the newly identified virus
isolate was most closely related to APV (Fig. 4). From the four
serotypes of APV that have been described14,15, APV serotype C,
the metapneumovirus found primarily in birds of the United
States, showed the closest resemblance to the newly identified
virus; however, only limited sequence information for APV
serotype D is available.
Experimental infection of birds and cynomolgus macaques
Since hMPV appeared to be closely related to APV, we wished to test
whether hMPV is a primary human pathogen or an avian pathogen
that can also infect humans. We inoculated four juvenile turkeys,
four juvenile chickens and four juvenile cynomolgus macaques with

electron microscopy after PTA staining24. Magnification, ×92,000.

hMPV. A schematic diagram of APV (3′ to 5′ end, left to right) is shown
above the fragments obtained with RAP-PCR and RT-PCR on virus isolate
00-1. Fragments 1–10 were obtained using RAP-PCR. Fragment A was ob￾tained with a primer in RAP-PCR fragments 1 and 2 and a primer designed
on basis of alignment of leader and trailer sequences of APV and RSV 
(ref. 7). Fragment B was obtained with primers designed in RAP-PCR frag￾ments 1 and 2 and RAP-PCR fragment 3. Fragment C was obtained with
primers designed in RAP-PCR fragment 3 and RAP-PCR fragments 4–7.

50,000 TCID50 of hMPV on their conjunctivae and in their respira￾tory tracts. We collected cloaca and/or throat samples and tested
them for the presence of hMPV by RT-PCR. During the three weeks
follow-up, none of the birds showed clinical signs or virus replication
as determined by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the throat and
cloaca swabs. In contrast, the virus replicated efficiently in the respi￾ratory tract of all four monkeys as shown by RT-PCR of RNA isolated
from the throat swabs. Whereas viral RNA was not detectable in sam￾ples taken at day 1, virus replication peaked between days 2 and 8
after inoculation. Two of the monkeys presented with mild upper
respiratory tract signs that upon histological analysis proved to be as￾sociated with suppurative rhinitis (data not shown). Although the
detailed pathological, virological and immunological analyses are in￾complete at present, these preliminary data indicate that hMPV is a
primate pathogen associated with respiratory disease.
Genetic heterogeneity of hMPV isolates
We next amplified small parts of the N, M, F
and L ORFs (71, 143, 142 and 102 nucleotides
respectively) for 9 of the 28 virus isolates by
RT-PCR, then sequenced these fragments di￾rectly to minimize the possibility of errors in￾troduced by the amplification procedure.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed significant se￾quence variation and the existence of two po￾tential genetic clusters of hMPV isolates
obtained in the Netherlands (Fig. 5). The nu￾cleotide sequence identity between isolates
within a cluster was 90–100% for all four frag￾ments, whereas the sequence identity for iso￾lates between the two clusters was 81–88%.
Variation was similar for the N, M, F and L frag￾ments and did not seem to correlate with the
year of virus isolation (indicated by the first
two numbers in the name of the isolates).
These genetic clusters might represent sub￾groups of the newly identified virus in analogy
to other pneumoviruses such as RSV.
Seroprevalence
To study the prevalence of this virus in the
human population, we tested sera from humans in different age
categories by indirect IFA using tMK cells infected with one of the
unidentified virus isolates. This analysis revealed that 25% of the
children aged between 6 and 12 months had antibodies to the
virus, and towards the age of 5 virtually all of the children had be￾Fig. 3 Nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences

come seropositive (Table 1). In addition,
56 serum samples tested by indirect IFA
were tested by virus neutralization as￾says. For 51 (91%) of the samples, the re￾sults of the virus neutralization assay
(titer > 8) correlated with the results ob￾tained with indirect IFA (titer > 32). Four
samples that were positive in IFA (titer >
32) were negative by virus neutraliza￾tion tests (titer < 8), and one serum sam￾ple that reacted negative in IFA (titer <
32) was positive in the virus neutraliza￾tion test (titer > 16).
Indirect IFA conducted with 72 sera
taken from humans in 1958 (aged 8–99
years)16,17 revealed a 100% seroprevalence, indicating that the
virus has been circulating in the human population for more
than 43 years. In addition, testing of a number of these sera in
virus neutralization assays confirmed the IFA data (Table 1).
The range of antibody titers appeared higher for individuals
older than 2 years as compared to children between 6 and 24
months. This observation could be related to boosting of anti￾body responses as a consequence of reinfection with the same
or a closely related virus. However, more detailed serological
and virological analyses will be required to substantiate this
speculation.
Discussion
Here we describe the characterization of a new member in the
Paramyxoviridae family, isolated from 28 children with RTI in the
Netherlands. The children presented with clinical symptoms
reminiscent of those caused by hRSV infection, ranging from
mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and
pneumonia. As is seen with hRSV-infected children, very young
hMPV-infected children appeared to require hospitalization and
mechanical ventilation. Whether hMPV infection causes RTI
cannot be formally concluded from the present data. Most im￾portantly, acute and convalescent paired sera were not available
for the children from whom hMPV was isolated. However, con￾sidering that no other virus was identified in any of the 28
hMPV-infected children and that hMPV was not isolated from
400 samples taken from children under two years of age without
respiratory symptoms (not shown), a causal relationship seems
likely. The experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques sup￾ports this conclusion.
Based on the data here we propose the name human metap￾neumovirus (hMPV). hMPV proved to have a paramyxovirus-like
morphology in electron microscopy, to be chloroform-sensitive
and to replicate optimally in a trypsin-dependent manner in
tMK cells. The clinical symptoms of the hMPV-infected children,
the characteristic cytopathic effects and the lack of haemaggluti￾nating activity further suggested that this virus might be related
to hRSV; although most paramyxoviruses have hemagglutinat￾ing activity, most of the pneumoviruses do not18. Genetic analy￾ses of the putative N, M, P and F genes revealed that hMPV
showed a higher sequence homology to the recently proposed
genus Metapneumovirus (average of 66%) as compared to the
genus Pneumovirus (average of 30%) and a genomic organization
that is most similar to APV/TRTV. In contrast to the genomic or￾ganization of the pneumoviruses (3’-NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F￾M2-L-5′), metapneumoviruses lack NS1 and NS2 genes and have
a different positioning of the genes between M and L (3’-N-P-M￾F-M2-SH-G-L-5′). The absence of ORFs between the M and F
genes in this virus and the lack of NS1 and NS2 genes adjacent to
N is in agreement with it being the first identified non-avian
member of the Metapneumovirus genus. However, until sequence
information becomes available for the entire genomic organiza￾tion of hMPV, a definitive classification of this virus is not possi￾ble.
Of the four serotypes of APV that have been described, serotype
C was most closely related to hMPV based on the N, P, M and F
genes. However, for serotype D only limited sequence information
for the F gene is available from Genbank and for serotype B, only
M, N and F sequences are available. For both hRSV and APV, dif￾ferent genetic and serological subtypes have been described. We
also found evidence for genetic variation between hMPV isolates.
Although it is tempting to speculate that these subgroups of hMPV
isolates represent different serotypes of hMPV, sequence analyses
of other parts of the hMPV genome and of isolates obtained from
different geographical locations as well as detailed serological
studies will be needed to support this hypothesis.
Our serological survey revealed that hMPV commonly infects
children. The repeated isolation of this virus from clinical sam￾ples from children with RTI indicates that hMPV infection may

have considerable clinical and economical impact. New diagnos￾tic assays based on virus detection and serology should allow a
more detailed analysis of the incidence and both clinical and
economic impact of this newly identified human virus. To get an
idea of the potential impact of this virus for RTI we have tested
nasopharyngeal aspirate samples collected during the 2000 win￾ter season from children presenting with RTI, at Erasmus
University Medical Center that were negative for RSV, influenza
A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1–3, human rhi￾novirus and Corona virus (HCV-229E and HCV-OC43). Seven of
the 68 samples tested proved to be positive for hMPV by RT-PCR,
indicating that for the 2000 winter season approximately 10% of
the unexplained RTI may be associated with hMPV.
The minor differences between our IFA and virus neutraliza￾tion results (5 samples) may be due to several factors; only IgG
serum antibodies are detected in IFA, virus neutralization anti￾bodies are generally directed against surface glycoproteins, the
sensitivities of the two assays may differ and different serotypes
of hMPV may exist. The latter suggestion is of particular interest,
since only one isolate (00-1) was used for IFA and virus neutral￾ization, potentially giving rise to false negative results using sera
raised against genetically distinct hMPV isolates such as those
shown in Fig. 5.
As hMPV seems most closely related to APV, we speculate that
the human virus has originated from birds. Analysis of serum
samples taken from humans in 1958 revealed that hMPV has
been widespread in the human population for at least half a cen￾tury, indicating that a possible zoonotic event must have taken
place before 1958.
The question then arises: Why has this virus remained uniden￾tified for so many years? First of all, many virology laboratories
use continuous cell lines for virus isolation, in which hMPV does
not seem to replicate efficiently. Second, hMPV displays very
slow replication kinetics in vitro, and may therefore have re￾mained undetected. Third, replication of hMPV in-vitro appeared
to be trypsin dependent and many of the earlier studies to find
respiratory pathogens did not use trypsin. Finally, the apparent
lack of cross-reactivity in the serologic assays we performed and
the low nucleotide sequence homology to known human viral
pathogens make unlikely the detection of hMPV with standard
serological or molecular techniques. Pringle and Eglin have de￾scribed serological evidence for an unidentified ‘PVM-like’ pneu￾movirus that frequently infects humans19. We feel it is unlikely
that hMPV is the PVM-like-virus described by Pringle and Eglin
for a number of reasons. First, high-titer sera specific for several
paramyxoviruses, including PVM and RSV, failed to react in im￾munofluorescence studies with hMPV-infected tMK cells as tar￾gets (data not shown). Second, most of our hMPV–positive
human serum samples did not have PVM-specific antibodies as
measured by ELISA. Furthermore, PVM (and supposedly a PVM￾like virus) has hemagglutinating activity, whereas we have no
evidence that hMPV does. Finally, the genomic organization of
PVM is similar to that of RSV and thus different from that of
hMPV.
The identification of this tentative new member of the
Metapneumovirus genus may aid in the development of diagnos￾tic assays, vaccines and antiviral agents for viral RTIs.
Methods
Virus isolation. Over the past decades our virus diagnostic hospital-based
laboratory has collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from children suffering
from RTI. These samples were routinely tested for the presence of viruses by
direct immune fluorescence assays (DIF) using antibodies against viruses
known to cause RTI (hPIV types 1–3, hRSV, influenza virus types A and B)
and by virus isolation using rapid shell-vial techniques on tMK cells and CEF,
as well as various cell lines such as Vero, A549 and MDCK cells20,21. Samples
showing cytopathic effects after 2 or 3 passages that were negative in DIF
were tested by indirect IFA using virus-specific antibodies against influenza
virus types A, B and C, hRSV, hPIV types 1–4, measles virus, mumps virus,
Sendai virus, SV-5, and NDV. Although for many cases the etiological agent
could be identified, some specimens yielded cytopathic effects in cell cul￾tures but were negative for all viruses tested.
Animal immunization. To raise virus-specific antisera, 1.0 ml volumes of
virus-infected tMK cell-culture supernatants of 2 different virus isolates con￾taining approximately 1 × 104 TCID50/ml were used to inoculate guinea
pigs and ferrets intranasally without prior purification. Samples were taken
at day 0 and at day 14 or 28 after infection, the animals were bled by car￾diac puncture and their pre- and post-infection sera were used as negative
and positive reference sera respectively. The sera were tested for reactivity
against all previously described viruses with DIF and IFA as described above.
Virus characterization. We cultured the virus isolates in tMK cells in Eagle’s
MEM with Hanks’ salt, supplemented with 0.02% trypsin and without
serum. After inoculation, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for a maximum
of 14 d during which time the medium was changed once a week and cul￾tures were checked daily for cytopathic effects. Because the degree of cyto￾pathic effects differed slightly for each isolate, all cultures were tested at
days 10–14 with indirect IFA using ferret antisera raised against one of the
isolates. For electron microscopy analyses, virus was concentrated from in￾fected cell-culture supernatants in a micro-centrifuge at 4 °C at 17,000g,
after which the pellet was resuspended in PBS and after potassium tungstat
acid (PTA) staining, inspected by negative contrast electron microscopy22.
Standard hemagglutination assays, chloroform sensitivity tests, DIF and IFA
were performed as described11,20,21,23. Virus neutralization assays were per￾formed on tMK cells with serial 2-fold dilutions of human or animal sera
(starting at 1:8) and with 100 TCID50 of hMPV, following procedures as de￾scribed23. Since cytopathic effects were not always easy to detect, IFA was
used to determine the virus neutralization titer. The virus neutralization titer
was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum sample re￾sulting in negative IFA and inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell cultures.
RAP-PCR and RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from the supernatant of infected
cell cultures or sucrose gradient fractions using a High Pure RNA Isolating kit
according to instructions from the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics,
Almere, the Netherlands). RT-PCR assays were performed according to es￾tablished techniques. Primers specific for the panel of paramyxoviruses
tested and conditions are available upon request. For RAP-PCR, virus was
concentrated from infected tMK-cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation on
a 20–60% sucrose gradient. Gradient fractions were inspected for the pres￾ence of virus-like particles by electron microscopy and poly-acrylamide gel
electrophoresis followed by silver staining. The approximately 50% sucrose
fractions that appeared to contain nucleocapsids were used for RNA isola￾tion and RAP-PCR. RAP-PCR was performed essentially as described12,13 and
primer sequences used are available upon request. Differentially displayed
fragments specific for hMPV were purified from the gel with a Qiaquick Gel
Extraction kit (Qiagen, Leusden, the Netherlands) and cloned in vector
pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Groningen, the Netherlands) according to instructions
from the manufacturer.
Sequence analysis. RAP-PCR products cloned in vector pCR2.1 were se￾quenced with M13-specific oligonucleotides. DNA fragments obtained by
RT-PCR were purified from agarose gels using a Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit
(Qiagen, Leusden, the Netherlands) and sequenced directly with the same
oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR assays. Sequence analyses were per￾formed using a Dyenamic ET terminator sequencing kit (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Roosendaal, the Netherlands) and an ABI 373 auto￾matic DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystem, Nieuwerkerk aan den TJssel,
the Netherlands), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Phylogenetic analyses. For all phylogenetic trees, DNA sequences were
