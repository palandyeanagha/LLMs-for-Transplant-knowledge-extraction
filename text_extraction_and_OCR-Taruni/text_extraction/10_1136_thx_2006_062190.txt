Abstract
Rationale: Little knowledge exists on structural changes and
plugging in small airways in cystic fibrosis.
Objective: To characterise the extent of plugging and contribution
of secreted mucins to the plugs.
Methods: Small airways in patients with cystic fibrosis at
transplantation (n = 18) were compared with control non-smokers
(n = 10). Tissue sections were stained with Alcian blue (AB)/
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), for mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC, and
for neutrophils and its chemoattractant interleukin (IL) 8.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligand pro-
transforming growth factor α were also identified using
immunohistochemical staining. Epithelial and luminal contents
were assessed morphometrically.
Results: Plugs occupying >50% of total luminal volume were
found in 147 of 231 (63.6%) airways in patients with cystic fibrosis,
but only in 1 of 39 (2.6%) airways in controls. In the epithelium of
patients with cystic fibrosis, AB/PAS, MUC5B, and MUC5AC-stained
volume densities were increased 10-fold (p<0.01), indicating
increased mucin production. In airway lumens, staining for mucins
was also increased in cystic fibrosis, indicating increased mucin
secretion. In the epithelium of patients with cystic fibrosis,
neutrophil numbers were markedly increased and were inversely
correlated with volume densities of mucous glycoconjugates (r = 
−0.66, p<0.005). IL8 staining was increased in the epithelium of
patients with cystic fibrosis and colocalised with mucins. Staining


for EGFR and for pro-transforming growth factor α were increased
in the epithelium of patients with cystic fibrosis; positive
correlations were found between EGFR-stained volume density and
both AB/PAS and IL8-stained volume densities.
Conclusions: Most of the small airways are plugged in cystic
fibrosis at the time of transplantation. Mucins contribute to airway
plugging. Recruited neutrophils may be involved in mucin secretion
in the plugs. Increased expression of EGFR and its ligand suggests
roles in mucin synthesis and neutrophil recruitment.
