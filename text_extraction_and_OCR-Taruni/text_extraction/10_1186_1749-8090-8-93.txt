Abstract
Background: In spite of improved survival after palliation for single ventricle, interstage mortality for a single
ventricle with heterotaxy syndrome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to quantify interstage mortality and
influence mortality risk factors.
Methods: From November 1994 until February 2012, all patients that had a functional single ventricle and
heterotaxy syndrome who underwent palliative operations at our center were included. Patients with hypoplastic
left heart syndrome and operative mortality cases were excluded. The factors that influenced interstage mortality
were determined by multivariate Cox analysis.
Results: There were 16 patients with interstage mortality (41.0%), much higher than the non-heterotaxy group
(vs. 11.3%, P = 0.001, OR = 5.478). The major presumptive causes of death were infection or sepsis (37.5%) and
unknown sudden death (31.3%). When we compared the survival group and the mortality group with heterotaxy
syndrome, Blalock-Taussig shunt as a 1st palliation is most common for both groups but there were more for the
mortality group (81.2% vs. 52.2%), and there were more with bidirectional cavo-pulmonary shunt as a 1st palliation
in the survival group (10 patients vs. 2 patients). The existence of pulmonary vein stenosis at initial diagnosis was
more common for the mortality group. In multivariate Cox analysis, however, the duration of hospitalization at
palliation, the duration of intensive care unit stay after palliation and the existence of pulmonary vein stenosis at
diagnosis were significant risk factors.
Conclusion: Interstage mortality for a functional single ventricle with heterotaxy syndrome is significantly higher
than for non-heterotaxy syndrome. Therefore more attention should be given to the prevention of interstage
mortality in these patients with risk factors.

Background
Operative survival after a 1st stage operation for Fontan
candidates including those with hypoplastic left heart syn￾drome (HLHS) has significantly improved [1]. This might
be due to earlier detection of single ventricular heart
disease, improved pre- and post-operative management
and refinements in surgical technique. But interstage mor￾tality has been reported to persist at high rates (varying
from 10% to 25% for survivors) after a single ventricle
palliative cardiac surgery [2-4]. The reasons are not well
known but respiratory infection, sepsis, anatomic stenosis,
low cardiac output, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death
have been reported as causes for HLHS [1,5]. Improve￾ment of interstage survival using treatments such as a
home monitoring program and an active treatment pro￾gram for feeding difficulties have been used for Fontan
candidates, giving significant improvement following a

Norwood operation [6]. But there were few studies about
interstage mortality after single ventricle palliation in
heterotaxy syndrome. Recently Ota et al. reported an
improved outcome of surgical management of right isom￾erism in which the five year survival had improved from
53.8% before 2003 to 81.7% after 2004 [7]. Although there
are few reports of improved survival after a modified
Fontan operation for heterotaxy syndrome [8,9] we
needed to investigate the interstage mortality for these
patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the
interstage mortality for single ventricle patients with
heterotaxy syndrome and compare it to that for non￾heterotaxy syndrome. Furthermore, we tried to find risk
factors for interstage mortality after a palliative stay for a
single ventricle heterotaxy syndrome patient.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with
a functional single ventricle and heterotaxy syndrome
who underwent a Fontan operation or died during the
interstage period following palliative surgery as a Fontan
candidate at Samsung Medical Center from November
1994 until February 2012. This study was approved by
the Samsung Seoul Hospital Institutional Review Board
and individual consent for the study was waived. Pallia￾tive operations included a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT)
shunt, pulmonary artery band (PAB) and bidirectional
cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS). In this study we excluded
patients with a hypoplastic left heart syndrome or a variant
and the patients who died early after each palliative oper￾ation. The patients who didn’t undergo Fontan operation
but were waiting Fontan operation were excluded because
2nd interstage period was not completed. Interstage mor￾tality was defined as mortality that occurred during the
period from discharge after the previous palliative oper￾ation until before the hospitalization for the next palliative
operation. As well, a death that occurred 30 days after the
operation was regarded as interstage mortality. Heterotaxy
syndrome was classified as right isomerism and left isomer￾ism based on the reviews of echocardiographic and postop￾erative findings using the criteria proposed by Van Praagh
and colleagues [10]. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome or
variants were established from echocardiographic findings
of obstruction of the systemic outflow and inflow tract that
required Norwood operation. The end points for this study
were completion of a Fontan operation or death before the
next operation as a Fontan candidate. A total of 39 patients
were identified for this study. In further analysis we identi￾fied 71 single ventricle patients who did not have
heterotaxy syndrome or hypoplastic left heart syndrome
and operative mortality was excluded.
Patients’ records were carefully reviewed for a diagno￾sis and each palliative operation. Post-operative deaths
were identified from the post-operative medical records.
All of the interstage deaths were investigated with the
medical records and in an interview by the hospital
members. We contact every patient who was lost from
our regular follow up and uncovered the death and
causes of death. We also gathered information about
survival or the cause of death from National Institute of
Statistics Korea. For further analysis, some variables for
interstage mortality in heterotaxy syndrome were evalu￾ated. We defined hospitalization as an admission for a
major palliative cardiac operation and discharge as the
last day of hospitalization after a major cardiac oper￾ation. We categorized body weight as: under 3rd per￾centile, from the 3rd to 25th percentile, from the 25th to
50th percentile and more than the 50th percentile con￾sidering the normal value for their ages. Valvular regur￾gitation and pulmonary venous stenosis were checked by
a two dimensional echocardiogram by pediatric cardiolo￾gists. Pulmonary venous stenosis was observed by echo￾cardiography, cardiac computed tomographic images
and simple chest X-ray image. High velocity or continu￾ous pulmonary venous flow in Doppler echocardiog￾raphy, narrowed diameter of pulmonary venous tract
associated with dilated proximal pulmonary vein on
tomographic images and pulmonary edema on chest X￾ray were defined as pulmonary venous stenosis. And
infra-cardiac type of anomalous pulmonary venous
return usually regarded as obstructive type.
We compared the cumulative survival rate of the
heterotaxy group with that of the non-heterotaxy group
by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank method. Stu￾dent’s t-test and chi square test were used for a compari￾son of the two independent groups. Cox analysis was
used to analyze the influencing factors of interstage mor￾tality in heterotaxy syndrome. For multivariate analysis,
we selected factors that showed a P valve less than 0.25
in univariate analysis. The continuous variables are
expressed as mean values ± standard deviations. SPSS
19.0 was used for our statistical analysis.
Results
From 44 patients with functional single ventricle and
heterotaxy syndrome who underwent palliative opera￾tions, 5 were excluded due to early operative death. Four
patients died immediately after the BT shunt palliation
and 1 patient died after PAB palliation (Figure 1). There￾fore 39 patients were included in this study of which 23
completed their Fontan operation. Of the 39 patients
with heterotaxy syndrome, 25 were males (64.1%). There
were 33 patients with right isomerism and 4 with left
isomerism. The remaining 2 patients had ambiguous
morphology. The age at the last follow up was 90.8 ±
93.9 months old. Their first palliations were a modified
BT shunt in 25 patients (64.1%), PAB in 2 patients
(5.1%) and BCPS in 12 patients (30.8%). The median age

at BT shunt or PAB as 1st palliation was 0.8 months of
age and the median age of BCPS as 1st palliation was
9.6 months of age. There were 16 patients with
interstage mortality (41.0%). On the other hand, 71
patients of the non-heterotaxy group already excluded 9
early operative mortalities (7 patients after BT shunt, 2
patients after BCPS) who had undergone a modified BT
shunt (46 patients; 64.8%), PAB (10 patients; 14.1%) and
BCPS (15 patients; 21.1%) as a first palliation. The
interstage mortality in the non-heterotaxy group was
11.3% (8 patients) with 9.4 months as the median age.
There were no significant differences in age, sex, ages of
1st palliation and types of 1st palliation between the
heterotaxy syndrome and the non-heterotaxy group.
However, the interstage mortality for patients with
heterotaxy syndrome was much higher than the non￾heterotaxy group (P = 0.001) (Table 1) and the cumula￾tive survival rate except for postoperative death was
significantly lower for heterotaxy syndrome with a func￾tional single ventricle (P = 0.001, OR = 5.4, 95% CI: 2.06-
14.50) (Figure 2). The ages of interstage deaths and the
time interval from palliation to death were not different
significantly between the two groups. There are 9 males
Figure 1 Among 44 patients of single ventricle with heterotaxy
syndrome, except for 5 operative deaths, we experienced 16
interstage deaths. Therefore 23 patients had completed
Fontan procedure.

in 16 patients of interstage mortality and the median age
of death was 4.4 (1.2-221.1) months old and the median
time interval from the palliation to death was 2.5 (0.6-
62.2) months in the heterotaxy group. The presumptive
causes of death were infection or sepsis in 6 patients
(37.5%), unknown sudden death in 5 patients (31.3%),
arrhythmia in 2 patients (12.5%), pulmonary venous ob￾struction in 2 patients (12.5%) and heart failure with
atrioventricular valve regurgitation in 1 patient (6.3%).
We determined sudden death with unknown etiology
because some of patients were found to be dead outside
our hospital and the others were in state of death on
arrival at our hospital. Despite the possible assumptions,
we could not confirmed the causes of sudden death due
to lack of information. Infection as a cause of death was
presumed because laboratory findings on admission
showed elevated leukocyte count and inflammatory titer
even though no organisms were proven. Some of the
patients showed disseminated intravascular coagulation
and typical septic feature. Two patients of arrhythmia as
a cause of death showed sudden severe bradycardia with
atrioventricular block at emergency room and refractory
atrial tachycardia in spite of continuing antiarrhythmic
agents with sudden ventricular failure at emergency
room. Residual stenosis in pulmonary venous inflow was
consistently found after operation in two patients who
had undergone the corrective operation of pulmonary
venous anomaly with obstruction at the first palliation.
The 1st palliation was a modified BT shunt in 13 patients
(81.3%), PAB in 1 patient (6.3%) and BCPS in 2 patients
(12.5%). Thirteen patients with interstage mortality
(81.3%) died before BCPS whereas only 3 patients (18.7%)
died after BCPS. In the non heterotaxy group, 6 patients
with interstage mortality (75.0%) died before BCPS and 2
patients (25.0%) died after BCPS and there was no signifi￾cant difference from the heterotaxy group (P = 0.722).

to those of the survival group in heterotaxy syndrome. The
number of patients with right isomerism was more for the
mortality group (93.8% vs. 78.3%) and the left isomerism
was only for the survival group. In terms of 1st palliation,
the BT shunt is the most common palliation for both
groups but more in the mortality group (81.2% vs. 52.2%)
and the number of patients with BCPS as a 1st palliation
was more for the survival group (10 patients vs. 2 patients).
The ages at the 1st palliation were significantly higher for
the survival group possibly due to a higher portion of
BCPS as a 1st palliation (4.1 ± 3.1 vs. 1.5 ± 2.3 months old,
P = 0.007). It is interesting that body weight at discharge
after palliative surgery was lower in the mortality group.
Patients with a body weight below the 3rd percentile were
75.0% of total patients while only 17.4% of patients in sur￾vival group had a body weight below the 3rd percentile.
The existence of pulmonary vein stenosis at initial diag￾nosis was more common in the mortality group (37.5%
vs. 17.4%). The duration of hospitalization, intensive
care unit (ICU) stay, and the duration of treatment with
mechanical ventilation, intravenous (IV) inotropes and
total parenteral nutrition were longer in the mortality
group than those of the survival group. The patients
who had significant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
took antiarrhythmic agents. Four patients showed atrial
tachycardia with frequent premature atrial beats after
palliation and one patient showed nonsustained ven￾tricular tachycardia. Amiodarone or sotalol had been
used for these patients. There was no significant differ￾ence in the medication of antiarrhythmic agents be￾tween groups. Oxygen saturation at discharge in the
survival group was markedly higher than that of the
mortality group in functional single ventricle with
heterotaxy syndrome (Table 2).
In univariate Cox analysis, the type of 1st palliation
when BCPS was compared with BT shunt and PAB, the
proportion of low body weight at discharge (< 3 percentile),
the duration of treatment with mechanical ventilation and
the duration of IV inotropes were significant risk factors
for interstage mortality (P < 0.05). But in multivariate Cox
analysis, the duration of hospitalization at palliation, the
duration of ICU stay after palliation and the existence of
pulmonary vein stenosis at diagnosis were significant risk
factors (Table 3).
Discussion
It is well known that the prognosis of patients with com￾plex heart disease and heterotaxy syndrome is very poor.
Each isomerism has characteristic cardiac anatomical
abnormalities. Almost without exception, patients with a
right isomerism have obstruction of the pulmonary out￾flow tract, as well as common mixing situations, and
pulmonary atresia is present in two-fifths of cases [11].
More patients with a right isomerism commonly have
obstructed anomalous pulmonary venous connection
and occasionally they have serious extracardiac anomal￾ies [12]. In contrast to a right isomerism, heart disease
in a left isomerism may be relatively mild and a review
showed only one-third had complex cyanotic heart
disease with a univentricular heart [13]. Interestingly,
Asians show a higher prevalence of heterotaxy syndrome
compared to Westerners [14] and our series showed
35.5% (39/110) of heterotaxy in Fontan candidates
excluded an operative mortality.
We can easily understand that most of our patients
were patients with right isomerism and the most of the
first palliative procedures were BT shunts. In some cases
of well-balanced hemodynamic condition with adequate
pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, the first palliation
of BCPS is possible. In our study BCPS as a 1st palliation
was performed in 30.8% of the total and more in the
survival group. It could be the reason that the age of the
1st palliation in survival group was older than that of
mortality group. We do not have any special policy
about the timing of BCPS with heterotaxy syndrome.

There were various reasons revealed for death. Because
much interstage mortality occurred outside of our hos￾pital, it was difficult to find a cause of death for each case.
The state of the spleen and the extracardiac anomalies in
heterotaxy syndrome may be important risk factors for
mortality. In general, a greater frequency of fulminating
and fatal septicemia is possible in a right isomerism and
that is the reason for the strong recommendation of
pneumococcal and H. influenza vaccines. The most
frequent cause of interstage death in our patients was
infection but we did not have an isolated organism in the
six patients who died due to severe infection. Even though
infection was also the most important cause of interstage
mortality in the non heterotaxy group, infection control
and prevention is very important in heterotaxy syndrome
with a functional single ventricle in the interstage period.
We had 7 patients who died of unknown sudden
causes or arrhythmia (43.8%) among whom only 1
patient had been prescribed antiarrhythmic agents. The
causes of interstage mortality in HLHS patients have
been extensively studied and it has been described that a
preoperative or postoperative history of arrhythmia was
associated with a sudden, unexpected interstage mortal￾ity [15]. In our study, most of the arrhythmias were
detected in ICU care after the palliation. There were no
serious arrhythmias that needed to be corrected immedi￾ately. We managed significant post-operative arrhyth￾mias medically after immediate post-operative period. In
some instances of right isomerism bilateral sinus node
activity is present and in left isomerism, true sinus
rhythm is less common. In many patients, a progressive
slowing of the heart rate has been noted with advanced
age, leading to the need for placement of a permanent
pacemaker [16,17]. Even though previous arrhythmia
history was not a significant risk factor in our study, we
were not sure if some of fatal arrhythmia that had not
been detected happened to the patients of sudden death.
We also should have an interest in shunt occlusion in
patients who underwent BT shunt as 1st palliation. For
the prevention of an unexpected sudden interstage
death, a comprehensive outpatient program using home
pulse-oximetry and daily weight monitoring is useful,
but the results were disappointing because interstage
mortality did not decrease even with vigilant outpatient
monitoring [18]. For the prevention of the thrombosis
after shunt operation, aspirin for 6 month after the
operation or till the next palliation is usually accepted in
our center.
Feeding difficulties after single ventricle palliation are
frequently encountered because of a lack of preoperative
feeding continued postoperatively, poor oromotor skills
or gastroesophageal reflux. In heterotaxy syndrome,
gastrointestinal malformation and feeding difficulties are
more frequent and associated with aspiration-related
death. Interestingly, Hebson et al. reported that neonates
undergoing single ventricle palliation who required a
gastrostomy and fundoplication were at increased risk of
interstage mortality [6]. They suggested feeding difficulty
as a marker for an increased risk of interstage mortality.
We did not realize the importance of the gastrointestinal
malformation and feeding difficulties in heterotaxy syn￾drome until recently, when frequent vomiting was
confirmed from malrotation in one patient. Nowadays
we carry out gastrointestinal evaluation in patients with
oral feeding difficulties after operation. Unfortunately we
cannot provide the complete data of gastrointestinal
abnormalities in our series. We suspected aspiration
associated with feeding might contribute sudden death
in one or two patients. However the interstage mortality
in the patients was significantly associated with the body
weight at discharge after the major palliative surgery.
Patient growth during the interstage period is a crucial
factor and studies have shown that weight gain in infants
with HLHS is particularly challenging [19]. The reasons
for poor weight gain and low body weight are not clear
in heterotaxy syndrome but may be multifactorial. Keller
et al. demonstrated a somatic growth delay in patients
with HLHS, particularly in the interstage period and also
demonstrated that a low weight-for-z score was associ￾ated with poorer outcomes including more frequent
interstage admission [20]. We did not observed frequent
admissions in our patient of interstage death and their
feeding status, but the distribution of discharge patient
body weight showed that 74.3% of our patients weighed
less at discharge, below 25 percentile, while only 58.9%
of our patients had their birth weight of below 25
percentile. A special nutritional and feeding program for
growth restricted infants in the interstage period was
required. With the special program, a higher weight gain
allowed them to have next palliative treatment at shorter
interval from the 1st palliative treatment [18].
Residual anatomical lesions were not so common in our
patients of interstage death but any undetectable minor
anatomical problems, especially pulmonary venous ob￾struction and airway obstruction due to heart failure could
contribute to the unexpected sudden death. The types of
the 1st palliation were one of three, BT shunt, PAB and
BCPS. As for BT shunt size, it depended on the patients’
body weight and surgical approach. Mostly 3.5 mm shunt
via sternotomy or 4 mm shunt via lateral thoracotomy was
used for our patients. In some cases we reduced the shunt
size because of overflow after palliation. When it comes to
PAB, external pulmonary artery banding via sternotomy is
usual in our center. The strength of bandings is based on
Trusler’s formula in single ventricle and is adjusted
according to oxygen saturation using hemoclip.
The period before BCPS is accepted as the vulnerable
period of sudden cardiac death in HLHS and interstage
Song et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery 2013, 8:93 Page 6 of 8

mortality in the period after the discharge from the first
palliation and before BCPS persists at rates varying from
5% to 19% [15]. Therefore from a HLHS study, the
authors concluded that early BCPS at less than 4 month
of age is safe in spite of a hospital course of longer
duration [21]. Our results in heterotaxy syndrome and
functional single ventricle showed that the interstage
mortality before BCPS was higher than that after BCPS
and the cumulative survival of the patients who under￾went BCPS as a 1st single ventricle palliation was much
better than that of the patients whose 1st palliation were
BTS or PAB. Therefore the BCPS as a 1st single
ventricle palliation might be superior to BTS or PAB in
terms of interstage mortality in heterotaxy syndrome
with functional single ventricle and well balanced
hemodynamics but further investigation is necessary.
The low oxygen saturation at discharge was one of the
risk factors for the interstage mortality in heterotaxy
syndrome with palliation for single ventricle. Shunt
obstruction has been accepted as a major cause of
cyanosis and sudden death in an infant with single ven￾tricle physiology after palliation. Ohman et al. reported
that home monitoring of oxygen saturation had the
potential to detect some of the life-threatening shunt
obstructions after BTS in infants with single-ventricle
physiology [22]. But we could not define the level of
oxygen saturation of high risk for the interstage home
monitoring of oxygen saturation.
Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage with obstruc￾tion in a single ventricle and heterotaxy syndrome is still
a high risk for operative mortality [23]. In our study,
pulmonary venous stenosis at diagnosis was a significant
risk factor of interstage mortality by multivariate Cox
analysis. Our patients did not show severe pulmonary
venous obstructions after the 1st palliation because
pulmonary venous anomalies with obstruction are
corrected at the initial stage by our policy. The repair of
the pulmonary venous connection anomaly did not
provoke a higher mortality than nonheterotaxy patients
from some reports [5,24], but our results showed that
the existence of the pulmonary venous obstruction was
an important factor for interstage mortality.
The post-operative course reflected by the duration of
hospitalization, ICU stays and IV inotropes after palliation
was important for interstage survival in our study. Residual
atrioventricular valvular regurgitation was not a risk factor
for our patients even though it was reported as a risk factor
for late mortality in right isomerism [7]. There was another
report that described moderate atrioventricular valvular
regurgitation and obstructed pulmonary venous anomaly as
risk factors in right isomerism [25]. We tried to correct
atrioventricular valvular regurgitation over mild degree as
soon as possible and many of correction were performed
when BCPS was achieved.
The first limitation of our study is that it is a retro￾spective study. We tried to identify the mortality cases
and the causes of death but we were unable to identify
the exact causes of death for some cases that died at
other hospitals or at home. We also were unable to
identify the presence of a spleen in some patients with
heterotaxy syndrome because some medical records
were not complete. In general we hypothesized a right
isomerism equaled asplenia and recommended prevent￾ive vaccination. The vaccination status also failed to be
defined for each patient. We excluded a few patients
alive that were waiting for BCPS or Fontan operation in
a functional single ventricle that made slightly higher
mortality rate. There are other important surgical factors
that impact on the mortality, such as bypass time, shunt
size, strength of banding and aortic regurgitation after
palliation. We ignored to analyze some factors because
of incompleteness and inaccuracy from old medical
record. We focused several risk factors for interstage
mortality in heterotaxy syndrome and further extensive
investigation will be necessary in this recent period of
developed surgical technique.
In summary, the interstage mortality in functional
single ventricle and heterotaxy syndrome was much
higher than the other non-heterotaxy group. Therefore
more attention should be given to the prevention of
interstage mortality in these patients.
Conclusion
Interstage mortality in a functional single ventricle with
heterotaxy syndrome was significantly higher than non￾heterotaxy syndrome. The duration of hospitalization for
palliation, the duration of ICU stay after palliation and
the existence of pulmonary vein stenosis at diagnosis
were significant risk factors for interstage mortality in
heterotaxy syndrome; therefore we need more careful
follow-up for the patients with risk factors.
