Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) is a serious complication related to the chronically 
elevated venous pressure and low cardiac output of this abnormal circulation. However, 
diagnostic markers for this condition are limited. We hypothesized that specific tests for 
fibrosis developed for other chronic liver diseases would identify a higher prevalence of 
FALD than ultrasound and standard laboratory tests and that identified abnormalities 
would correlate with time post-Fontan. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed 19 
children (average age 8.4 ± 4.3 and 5.4 ± 4.1 years post-Fontan) and 8 adults (aver￾age age 31.5 ± 8.9 and 21.1 ± 4 years post-Fontan) using standard serum laboratory 
investigations assessing hepatic integrity and function, the FibroTest, liver ultrasound, 
and transient elastography (FibroScan). In adult Fontan patients, hemoglobin, C-reactive 
protein, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were significantly increased, and white 
blood cell and platelet counts were significantly decreased in comparison to the pediatric 
cohort. International normalized ratio was mildly elevated in both children and adults. 
FibroTest results were suggestive of fibrosis regardless of time post-Fontan. FibroScan 
measurements were significantly correlated with time post-Fontan, but the incidence 
of ultrasound-detected liver abnormalities was variable. No cases of hepatocellular 
carcinoma were identified. Abnormalities suggestive of FALD occur in both children and 
adults post-Fontan. Select laboratory tests, and possibly ultrasound and FibroScan in 
some patients, appear to have the most promise for the non-invasive detection of FALD.

INTRODUCTION
Currently performed as a series of palliative surgeries, the 
Fontan circulation separates venous return from the heart allow￾ing volume unloading of the single ventricle and permitting 
normal arterial oxygen saturations. However, this is achieved at 
the expense of elevated central venous pressure and decreased 
cardiac output. Intolerance of the surgically created Fontan 
physiology can arise early or, more commonly, decades later 
during adulthood (1).
Liver disease, which includes cirrhosis, ascites, synthetic 
dysfunction, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and portal 
hypertension, is increasingly recognized as a potentially serious 
morbidity post-Fontan (2–4). Fontan-associated liver disease 
(FALD) is defined as abnormalities in liver structure and function 
resulting from the Fontan circulation and not related to another 
process (e.g., viral hepatitis, medications, or alcohol toxicity) 
(5). However, the prevalence of FALD is not well defined. Liver 
histology post-Fontan has been reviewed in multiple small case 
series including autopsy reviews and liver biopsies, and, in gen￾eral, more severe disease is identified in patients further out from 
Fontan completion (6–8).
The gold standard for the assessment of liver fibrosis is a 
liver biopsy, but this invasive procedure is not widely used 
for routine patient surveillance and requires an anesthetic in 
young patients, which may result in significant complications, 
and its accuracy for the detection of disease is limited to the 
area sampled. Some effective non-invasive methods of detec￾tion that have been investigated include looking for periph￾eral biomarkers of fibrosis in the blood using the FibroTest 
algorithm (9) and assessing liver elasticity, including transient 
elastography or FibroScan (10, 11). These tests for liver fibrosis 
have been well validated in other chronic liver diseases (e.g., 
viral hepatitis) but are relatively understudied post-Fontan 
(12, 13).
The goals of this study were to assess for signs of FALD in a 
group of pediatric and adult Fontan patients using non-invasive 
standard investigations as well as the FibroTest and FibroScan 
and identify potentially useful diagnostic tools.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
This cross-sectional study was approved by the Conjoint 
Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary 
(ID REB13-0663) and carried out between September 2013 
and April 2014. Patients eligible for inclusion were all stable 
patients post-Fontan within our catchment area of southern 
Alberta. Subjects were excluded if there was a history of non￾cardiac liver disease (i.e., viral hepatitis, excessive alcohol 
consumption) or other complications related to the Fontan 
physiology (e.g., protein-losing enteropathy). Informed 
written consent was obtained from all participants or their 
parent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient 
demographics and prior surgical details were obtained from 
the medical chart.
Investigations
Multiple laboratory investigations were measured using 
patient serum. Tests performed included complete blood count 
(CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and α-fetoprotein (AFP). 
Liver synthetic and metabolic function was evaluated using 
markers of coagulation [international normalized ratio (INR), 
partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor VII] as well as 
albumin, total protein, and bilirubins (total and direct). 
Measured liver enzymes included alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and 
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). The AST to platelet 
ratio index (APRI) was calculated as the ratio of the normal￾ized AST and platelet count (14). The FibroTest (FibroSURE 
in the USA) was calculated from five serum markers including 
total bilirubin, GGT, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein-A1, and α-2-
macroglobulin (9, 15).
An ultrasound of the liver (US) was requested to assess the 
liver parenchyma and identify any signs of portal hypertension. 
To enhance patient compliance and to reflect real-world test￾ing, performance and reporting of the US were not standard￾ized but all were performed in a clinically certified facility in 
Alberta, Canada. Each US was scored for the presence of (1) 
abnormal liver parenchyma, (2) presence of hepatic nodules, 
(3) evidence of portal hypertension (i.e., reversal of portal 
venous flow, omental thickening, varices), and (4) the presence 
of splenomegaly. The relative number of abnormalities reported 
was used to calculate an US-based score for each patient with 0 
indicating no abnormalities and 1 indicating all 4/4 abnormali￾ties present.
Transient elastography (FibroScan, Echosens, France) using 
the M probe was used for all Fontan patients and was performed 
by a single experienced operator in a standardized manner 
reporting the median value of at least 10 measurements from 
the right lobe of the liver (16). All scans were interpreted by an 
expert hepatologist (RPM), and liver stiffness was reported in 
kilopascals.
Statistics and Data Analysis
Laboratory data were compared to age-appropriate normal 
values provided by the performing clinical laboratory (Calgary 
Laboratory Services, Calgary, AB, Canada). Prevalence of abnor￾mal test results is expressed as the percentage of subjects above 
the upper limit of normal for each test. Most variables were not 
normally distributed, and results are expressed as median and 
ranges (10th and 90th percentiles). Medians between groups 
were compared using a non-parametric Wilcoxon two-sample 
test. Linear correlations between liver function tests and time 
post-Fontan were assessed using Spearman rank correlation 
coefficient. The presence of a significant difference between the 
number of abnormalities in each group (children vs. adults) 
was determined using Fisher exact probability test. A p < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. All analyses were per￾formed using SAS for Windows version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., 
Cary, NC, USA). Graphs and linear regression were generated 
using Prism 7 for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, 
CA, USA).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Our two patient groups (Table  1) included 19 children and 8 
adult Fontan patients. There were clear and expected differences 
between the two groups with regards to age and time post￾Fontan, and the adult group had, on average, undergone Fontan 
completion later than the pediatric group reflecting prior surgical 
practice. In the group of pediatric subjects, the dominant ventri￾cle was primarily a morphological right ventricle in contrast to 
the adult group. Most children had undergone an extracardiac 
Fontan, whereas the adult group was more evenly distributed.
Laboratory Investigations
Multiple differences in routine serum laboratory tests were noted 
between the pediatric and adult Fontan groups (Table  2). In 
comparison to the pediatric patients, white blood cell (WBC) 
and platelet counts were significantly decreased in the adult 
Fontan patients, and hemoglobin was significantly increased. 
Systemic inflammation was investigated using CRP and the 
median value was normal in both adults and children. AFP was 
not elevated beyond the reference range in any patient. A mild 
coagulopathy was noted in all patients with the median INR in 
both groups being above the normal reference range. PTT and 
factor VII were also noted to be at the upper range of normal for 
all patients.
Liver protein synthetic function was within normal limits for 
all patients as indicated by the normal values for serum albumin 
and total protein. Serum bilirubin levels (total and direct) were 
significantly higher in the adult Fontan patients. ALT and AST 
were not significantly different between the groups and were 
not significantly increased above the reference range. However, 
GGT was increased in the adult patient group, with three patients 
demonstrating levels twofold to ninefold above the upper limit 
of normal. For GGT in the pediatric patients, the greatest abnor￾mality was only 1.5-fold above the upper limit of normal. An 
elevated APRI was significantly correlated (R2 = 0.36, p = 0.01) 
with increasing time post-Fontan (Figure 1A), and when patients 
were dichotomized into those less than or more than 10  years 
post-Fontan, the APRI was significantly elevated (p =  0.02) in 
patients who were >10 years post-Fontan (Figure 1B).
Components of the FibroTest (haptoglobin, apolipoprotein￾A1) were within normal limits, but the median α-2-macroglobulin 
was above normal in the pediatric group although within normal 
limits for the adult patients. The calculated FibroTest (scale 
ranges from 0 to 1.0 with higher values indicating more severe 

Figure 2 | The FibroTest was abnormal for all patients regardless of 
time post-Fontan. No significant difference was observed between the 
pediatric and adult groups (R2 = 0.073, p = 0.26). A FibroTest score >0.48 
indicates stage 2 fibrosis and >0.75 indicates cirrhosis.

significantly elevated (p = 0.02) in patients who were >10 years post-Fontan.

disease) was markedly abnormal for all patients regardless of time 
post-Fontan (Figure 2), and there was no significant difference 
observed in the scores between the adult and pediatric groups 
(R2 = 0.073, p = 0.26) or when patients were dichotomized into 
less than and greater than 10 years post-Fontan (data not shown).
Ultrasound
An abdominal US was requested to identify abnormal liver 
parenchyma, the presence of any intrahepatic nodules, assess for 
evidence of portal hypertension, and splenomegaly. There were 
more patients from the adult group with multiple US abnormali￾ties (Table 3), but this increase over time (R2 = 0.16, p = 0.12) 
was not significant (Figure  3A). Similarly, when patients were 
dichotomized into those less than or more than 10 years post￾Fontan, there was a trend toward more US abnormalities being 
present with increased time post-Fontan (Figure  3B), but this 
difference was also not statistically significant (p = 0.27).
Transient Elastography (FibroScan)
The median liver stiffness score provided by the FibroScan was 
elevated for both the pediatric (14.6 kPa; 10th to 90th percentiles: 
7.1–24.2 kPA) and adult (22.4 kPa, 10th to 90th percentiles: 17.3–
36.3 kPa) Fontan patient groups and was borderline significantly 
different between the two groups (p =  0.056). However, there 
was a progressive and significant increase in liver stiffness with 
increasing time post-Fontan (Figure 4; R2 = 0.55, p = 0.0024).
DISCUSSION
We evaluated multiple investigations used in other chronic liver 
diseases for their applicability in detecting post-Fontan liver 
disease. Since FALD appears to be a progressive disease with 
increasing severity over time (17), we compared results from 
children to a group of adult Fontan patients as a surrogate for 
time post-Fontan. We also examined differences between groups 
of patients who were greater or less than 10 years post-Fontan 
to identify markers that potentially change over time and could 
therefore indicate FALD progression.
Liver-related abnormalities were observed in almost all par￾ticipants, regardless of time post-Fontan completion. The INR 
was mildly abnormal in both patient groups, possibly related to 
subclinical liver disease or the consumption of clotting factors 
(18). Among the standard laboratory investigations, the WBC 
and platelet counts tend to decrease, while hemoglobin and GGT 
increase over time. The hematological alterations (increased 
hemoglobin, decreased platelets) likely reflect changes in the 
Fontan circulation. The increase in hemoglobin may reflect the

development of venous collaterals and progressive relative cyano￾sis and the decrease in platelet count could be related to splenic 
sequestration due to progressive splenomegaly. This decrease in 
the platelet count is also responsible for the significant change in 
the APRI noted with increasing time post-Fontan. As has been 
documented previously, ALT and AST were generally unaffected 
post-Fontan with GGT being a more sensitive marker for liver 
injury (5, 19, 20). ALP was elevated in the pediatric cohort, but 
this reflects a developmental difference as indicated by the higher 
reference range for children. On the basis of US and serum AFP, 
we did not identify any cases of HCC in our patients, but the 
development of this disease remains a concern (21).
There was no significant difference in the FibroTest between 
the adults and children, and no significant increase was associ￾ated with increasing time post-Fontan. We hypothesize that the 
overall elevated scores of the FibroTest for all participants could 
be related to the presence of hepatic congestion or an alternative

ultrasound abnormalities, but the increase over time was not statistically significant (R2 = 0.16, p = 0.12). (B) There was a trend toward more US abnormalities being

process (e.g., liver regeneration) created by the Fontan circula￾tion, which could explain why this biomarker panel has not found 
utility in the detection of FALD (22).
Fontan-associated liver disease-related US findings in our 
patients were variable. The increase in US-detected abnor￾malities did not appear to increase significantly with increasing 
time post-Fontan. Use of a standardized protocol of reporting 
may be helpful in maintaining consistency of reporting. Our 
US results and the findings of others (23, 24) suggest that this 
test may be useful in following patients post-Fontan with the 
detection of portal hypertension or nodules, for example, being 
an indication for additional investigations and referral to a 
hepatologist.
Although for many patients the FibroScan was elevated 
and suggested the presence of fibrosis (and in some cases cir￾rhosis), there was a significant trend for increasing liver stiffness 
with increasing time post-Fontan. Although there is no way

age spectrum, which has not been commonly done in FALD 
studies. The incomplete collection of data for the US also limited 
its generalizability and strength of our conclusions.
CONCLUSION
Fontan-associated liver disease is increasingly recognized as 
being widely prevalent post-Fontan and has potentially serious 
implications for patients. However, non-invasively distinguishing 
between hepatic congestion and fibrosis remains challenging. In a 
group of patients with a wide range of ages and time post-Fontan, 
we attempted to identify investigations that could aid in follow￾ing patient liver health over time with the hypothesis that these 
fibrosis-specific tests would be useful in identifying FALD. Our 
study suggests that markers of liver fibrosis used in viral hepatitis 
(i.e., FibroTest) do not appear to provide reliable insight into 
progression of FALD-related fibrosis. For the surveillance of the 
liver in patients post-Fontan, we suggest serial monitoring of the 
CBC, INR, GGT, and AFP. Liver US allows for the identifica￾tion of premalignant changes and signs of portal hypertension, 
which are clinically important. Serial transient elastography may 
have utility in some patients, but this remains to be defined in a 
longitudinal study. We conclude that no single test is predictive 
or even useful and results of liver testing should be interpreted in 
the context of hemodynamic information.

Figure 4 | Liver stiffness increased with time post-Fontan.

to non-invasively distinguish between hepatic congestion and 
fibrosis, this finding, supported by the observations of others (10, 
25–27), suggests that transient elastography (or other measures of 
hepatic stiffness) could have utility in following at least some indi￾vidual patients post-Fontan (i.e., those with a low stiffness early 
post-Fontan and acceptable pulmonary pressures) to monitor 
for worsening FALD. However, interpretation of the FibroScan 
should occur in the context of other liver- and cardiac-specific 
investigations, and the definitive diagnosis of fibrosis would still 
require a liver biopsy in these patients.
Our study has several important limitations. We made only 
indirect diagnoses of FALD, and we did not compare our results 
to liver biopsy. However, liver biopsy is not routinely used post￾Fontan in most centers, and we sought to evaluate only non￾invasive tests. Particularly for the FibroTest, the lack of biopsy 
data made interpretation difficult since it is known that hepatic 
congestion can cause abnormalities in these tests that purport to 
measure fibrosis (25) although it has recently been shown that 
no correlation exists between the FibroTest and biopsy score 
(22). Other limitations include the relatively small number of 
patients, but we did sample from the continuum of the Fontan
