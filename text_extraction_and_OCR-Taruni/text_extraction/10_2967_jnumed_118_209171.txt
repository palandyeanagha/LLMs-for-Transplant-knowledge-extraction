Our goal was to assess the feasibility, safety, and utility of a novel
68Ga-nanocolloid radiotracer with PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy for
identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Methods: This was
a pilot study of patients from a tertiary cancer hospital who required
insertion of gold fiducials for prostate cancer radiation therapy. Par￾ticipation did not affect cancer management. Ultrasound-guided
transperineal intraprostatic injection of a PET tracer (iron oxide
nanocolloid labeled with 68Ga) was performed after placement of
the fiducials. PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy imaging took place at ap￾proximately 45 and 100 min after injection of the tracer. The study
was monitored using a Bayesian design with the assumption that at
least 1 SLN could be identified in at least two thirds of cases with
more than 80% confidence. Results: SLN identification was suc￾cessful in all 5 participants, allowing completion of the pilot study
as per protocol. No adverse effects were observed. Unexpected
potential pathways for transit of malignant cells, as well as the
expected regional drainage pathways, were discovered. Rapid
tracer drainage to pelvic bone, perivesicular, mesorectal, inguinal,
and Virchow nodes was identified. Conclusion: SLN identification
using 68Ga-nanocolloid PET/CT can be successfully performed.
Nontraditional pathways of disease spread were identified, includ￾ing drainage to pelvic bone and to perivesicular, mesorectal, ingui￾nal, and Virchow nodes. The prevalence of both aberrant and
nonlymphatic pathways of spread should be further investigated
with this technique.

Our review of prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2010 from
the U.S. cancer registry of the National Cancer Institute showed
that more men were initially diagnosed at stage N0 M1 disease
(1,247 men) than at stage N1 M1 disease (558 men) (676 men
were initially diagnosed with stage Nx M1 disease) (1,2). Why
does prostate cancer seem to spread distantly despite the apparent
lack of involvement by regional lymph nodes? Possibilities
include lymphatic drainage to nodes not routinely sampled at
surgery or direct hematogenous spread, possibly by lymphatico￾venous channels. Indeed, aberrant sites, defined as those not tra￾ditionally targeted by elective surgery or radiation (paraaortic,
presacral, inguinal, and near the ventral abdominal wall), have
been identified in up to a third of patients using sentinel lymph
node (SLN) imaging with 99mTc-radiocolloid SPECT or SPECT/
CT (3). SLN imaging identifies the hypothetical first lymph node
that is reached by metastasizing cancer cells (4). The known pre￾disposition of metastasis to bone (5), in particular the pelvic and
lower vertebral bones (6), supports the possibility of an alternative
hematogenous route.
Despite the promise of SLN imaging, SPECT has technical
limitations compared with PET/CT (7). We postulated that intra￾prostatic administration of 68Ga-nanocolloid combined with PET/
CT would leverage the technical advantages of PET/CT to provide
sensitive identification of lymphatic pathways in clinically local￾ized prostate cancer. Herein, we report a first-in-human (to our knowl￾edge) trial assessing the feasibility, safety, and utility of PET/CT SLN
imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Patients who required implantation of gold fiducial markers into the
prostate before definitive prostate cancer radiation therapy were pro￾spectively recruited into our institutional review board–approved clinical
study (PMCC HREC project 13/80, National Ethics Application Form
submission code AU/1/1903112). All subjects gave written informed
consent.
Inclusion criteria consisted of biopsy-proven prostate adenocarci￾noma; the availability of serum prostate-specific antigen level and
routine staging scan (CT of abdomen/pelvis and bone scan) results;
a clinical stage of T1c–3b N0 M0; planned insertion of gold seed
fiducial markers for image-guided radiation therapy; and fitness for
general anesthetic. Patients could be receiving androgen deprivation
or other systemic treatment at the time of radiation planning.
Patients were excluded if they had hip or other prostheses that
might affect interpretation of PET/CT images (at physician discre￾tion); previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, including inguinal
hernia repair and surgery for undescended testis, or any previous sur￾gery that could potentially interfere with abdominopelvic lymphatic
drainage.
Technique for SPECT/CT Lymphoscintigraphy
To familiarize all staff with the study procedures in preparation for
the experimental PET/CT tracer injection, the initial 3 participants
were imaged with SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy using a technique

for intraprostatic injection adapted from one previously described in the
literature (8–14).
SPECT Tracer. The SPECT tracer was 99mTc-antimony sulfide with
a size of 20 6 5 nm. This size was similar to that of the 68Ga-iron
oxide, which was also 20 nm with a hydrodynamic diameter of approxi￾mately 25 nm.
SPECT/CT Injection Technique. Under general anesthesia, eight 20-
MBq doses of 99mTc-antimony sulfide colloid were injected into the
prostate using a standard transperineal template with transrectal ultra￾sound guidance. There were 2 needle tracts on either side enabling
injection at the apex, mid prostate, base, and peripheral regions (Fig.
1). Eight sites of injection were chosen with the aim of assessing drain￾age from all areas of the prostate and improving sensitivity.
The speed and placement of the tracer into the prostate under
transrectal ultrasound guidance was improved by first placing 4 sharp
guide catheters (18-gauge 250-mm prostate seeding needle set) into
position, 2 on each side, laterally and medially. Because of needle
flexibility, the 18-gauge catheters were required to guide the injections.
Injection from each of the 8 previously prepared syringes via a 22-gauge
150-mm Sprotte cannula (PAJUNK GmbH) was performed, in turn,
under direct transrectal ultrasound vision in the sagittal plane. The 150-
mm-long cannulas were required to reach the base of the prostate from
the perineum. It was found that deep, mid, and superficial points along
the tract of the medially placed catheters would correlate with the base,
central zone, and apex of the prostate. The more lateral catheter position
allowed injection into the peripheral zone of the mid prostate. The 22-
gauge narrow cannula allowed minimal dead space in the delivery
mechanism, important when delivering such a small amount of contrast.
The 250-mm guide catheters were cut down to 145 mm to allow for the
150-mm length of the cannula. This technique was successful in allowing
rapid and controlled placement of radiotracer.
SPECT/CT Acquisition and Image Interpretation. The patient was
then returned to the nuclear medicine department, where a whole￾body planar exam was performed (15 cm/min) followed by SPECT/
CT on a Symbia-6 g-camera (Siemens Healthineers). A low-dose,
unenhanced CT scan was acquired for anatomic correlation, followed
by SPECT using a step-and-shoot, noncircular orbit with 64 angles (32
per head) at 15 s per frame. The purpose of the SPECT/CT was to
familiarize all staff with the study procedures in preparation for the
experimental PET/CT tracer injection. Images were acquired at 2 time
points after injection: 45 min and 90–120 min. SLN uptake has been
reported to reach steady state after 150 min (13).
Images were analyzed by an experienced nuclear medicine physi￾cian. SLNs were defined in accordance with the results of the consen￾sus panel convened in 2016 (4): ‘‘All nodes that appear first in each
drainage basin as seen on early (15 min) lymphoscintigrams and/or late
lymphoscintigrams (and/or...SPECT-CT imaging) in new basins that
were not yet seen on the early images.’’ Other nodes were defined as
second-echelon nodes.
Technique for 68Ga-Nanocolloid PET/CT
Lymphoscintigraphy
PET Tracer. 68Ga was eluted from an onsite 68Ge/68Ga generator
(iThemba; IBD Holland BV) and purified using a method previously
described (15). Iron oxide nanoparticles with a 20-nm diameter consist￾ing of a 15-nm iron core with a coating of dextran were compounded on
site using previously validated techniques (16–18). Such nanoparticles
have been used as a paramagnetic contrast agent for clinical MRI. The
amount of iron oxide nanoparticle administered for PET imaging is less
than 1/100,000 of the usual dose used for MRI. Transmission electron
microscopy confirmed discrete nanoparticles with a 20-nm size. These
were radiolabeled with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid as the chelat￾ing agent onto the functionalized amine moiety of the dextran coat. The
final product was quality-assured for radiochemical purity and sterilized
via terminal filtration through a 0.22-mm filter before dispensing. The
product was divided into 8 sterile syringes for administration (Fig. 2).
A review of the literature provided good information for dose if
using 99mTc, but the dose for a PET tracer would be much less because
of the greater sensitivity of image acquisition. The dose prepared was
approximately 8 · 10 MBq per patient. The actual dose administered
was the difference between the initial and residual doses left in the
syringes and needles and was less than 80 MBq in total because of the
short 68Ga half-life of 68 min. Because our study was a pilot study
using interstitial injection of a PET tracer, it was unknown what the
ideal dose for administration should be. On the basis of the initial
imaging results, we were confident that the activity in each injection
could be decreased while still allowing SLN detection. This decrease
potentially extends the number of patients who could be scanned from
a given production and limits exposure of operators to radiation. The
mean administered activity (with SD) of the 68Ga-nanocolloid was
12.02 6 6.87 MBq (range, 3.1–21.0 MBq) (Table 1).
PET/CT Injection Technique. Exactly the same injection technique
as that trialed for SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy, described above,
was used.

PET/CT Acquisition and Interpretation. PET/CT scans were ac￾quired on a Discovery STE scanner (GE Healthcare). The first scan
was performed after extubation and discharge from the theater
recovery unit approximately 30–40 min after intraprostatic injection.
A dedicated acquisition of the pelvis was followed by imaging from
the upper thighs to the neck. Low-dose CT was used for attenuation
correction and anatomic localization. PET/CT imaging of the lower
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was repeated at 2 further time points
up to 130 min.
The images were analyzed by an experienced nuclear medicine
physician. As in the SPECT/CT imaging, SLNs were defined as all
nodes that appear first in each drainage basin as seen on early or late
lymphoscintigrams in accordance with consensus guidelines (4).
Other PET-avid nodes were defined as second-echelon nodes. The
intensity of tracer distribution was measured in units of SUV and
ratios of avidity as compared with other compartments and the
background.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy was defined as the capacity of the technique to identify
SLNs, because such a capacity would be an indicator of successful
lymphoscintigraphy technique. We aimed to demonstrate that at
least 1 sentinel node could be identified in at least two thirds of
cases with greater than 80% confidence. The study was monitored using
a Bayesian trial design based on a conservative (noninformative)
uniform prior (19). A minimum of 5 and maximum of 20 cases
were to be enrolled for the 68Ga component of the study. Any
adverse reactions during or after administration of the radiotracer
were recorded. Once 5 cases had been enrolled, event rates were
continuously monitored for feasibility and futility. If no negative
scans were seen in the first 5 cases, the estimated SLN identifica￾tion rate would be 86%, with a 91% probability that SLNs would
be identified in more than 66% of cases. The technique could then
be considered adequate and consideration given to ceasing further
accrual.
RESULTS
Eight men, aged 66–83 y (mean age, 73 y), participated in the
study between December 2013 and February 2015. The first three
underwent SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy, and the last five un￾derwent PET/CT. There were no adverse or clinically detectable
pharmacologic effects. No significant changes in vital signs were
observed.
Aberrant SLNs were found in 3 of the 5 participants
(perivesicular, mesorectal, and inguinal lymph nodes) who
underwent PET/CT imaging. Furthermore, in 1 participant a
second-echelon distal left thoracic duct region (Virchow node)
was visualized in the absence of upper abdominal or other
supradiaphragmatic uptake (Fig. 3). Second-echelon mesorectal
and retroperitoneal nodes were also noted. In one patient, a cur￾vilinear drainage pathway extending from the prostate bed to
the pubic ramus was observed. We postulate that this observa￾tion reflected a venous plexus rather than a lymphatic pathway
(Fig. 4).
SLNs were successfully identified in all 5 68Ga-nanocolloid
PET/CT cases, sufficient to satisfy the feasibility objective. 68Ga

SLNs were found both in classic sites of regional spread and in aberrant sites (boldface font). First 3 patients underwent 99mTc-radiocolloid
SPECT/CT, and next 5 underwent 68Ga-nanocolloid PET/CT. Scans were obtained about 45 and 100 min after tracer injection.
68GA PET/CT AND LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE • Doughton et al. 1839

avidity was still visible in SLNs at the second time point, approx￾imately 85–120 min after commencement of intraprostatic tracer
injection. One site initially had high uptake but did not retain 68Ga
avidity at the later time point—a finding that we interpreted as an
area of lymphatic pooling rather than a sentinel node. Table 1 lists
the SLN sites identified. In one patient, contrast was able to reflux
into the bladder neck, indicating passage from the interstitial space
into the prostatic urethra.
DISCUSSION
PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy with a novel 68Ga-iron oxide
nanocolloid was successful in all our patients. As well as easily
identifying the site of SLNs, the technique also identified sec￾ondary echelons of distant lymphatic spread. Aberrant lymphatic
pathways, similar to those reported in the SPECT imaging liter￾ature, were noted in 3 of 5 participants (3,10). Spread of tracer to
periprostatic, mesorectal, and perivesical sites was seen. In one
patient, tracer could be seen directly tracking to the bony pubic
ramus, consistent with an anatomic basis for the preferential
spread of prostate cancer to bones as hypothesized by Batson
(20). He proposed a valveless connection between the prostatic
venous plexus and the vertebral venous plexus and demonstrated
that dye in the prostatic plexus would preferentially fill the ver￾tebral veins rather than the caval system if intraabdominal pres￾sure was raised to simulate that of coughing, straining, or lifting.
This hypothesis is supported by the higher incidence of bone
metastases in the pelvis and lower vertebrae in patients with
prostate cancer than in patients with breast or lung cancer
(6,21,22). This tendency for spread to the lumbar and pelvic
bones is seen more obviously when the patient has three or fewer
metastases, suggesting that this site is preferred in the early stage
of metastasis, hypothetically before the cells reach the lungs and
the arterial side of the circulation (6).
The distribution of SLNs was similar to
that previously reported, confirming the
potential for lymphatic spread in an
unpredictable pattern, outside the classic
standard and extended pelvic lymph node
dissection templates. We hypothesize that
failure to manage this unpredictability
with SLN imaging has led to the lack of
success with standard treatment templates
for standard or extended pelvic lymph node
dissection and for whole-pelvis radiation,
with a significant proportion of high-risk
sites for disease being missed. SLN biopsy
in prostate cancer is still considered exper￾imental, and its role in improving oncologic
outcome remains controversial (4,23). We
propose a further study to obtain a more de￾tailed picture of anatomic variation and
to demonstrate whether lymphaticovenous
connection to adjacent bone is a common
anatomic finding. The use of whole-body
PET imaging in this study enabled visual￾ization of a distal left thoracic duct region
(Virchow node), which is also a docu￾mented pattern of spread (24).
Knowledge of the site of sentinel node
anatomic distribution through correlation
with PET/CT anatomy allows planning of nodal sampling,
although it is still potentially subject to sampling error. Coadmin￾istration of a 99mTc or fluorescent tracer could guide intraoperative
localization of sentinel nodes. The availability of intraoperative
probes suitable for detection of positron-emitting radionuclides is
also advancing (25). In the future, it would be interesting to use a
long-lived PET tracer, such as 64Cu or 89Zr.
We use multiparametric MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-11 in most high￾risk cases to identify sites of macroscopic regional nodal involve￾ment and to exclude distant disease. In such cases, treatment is
planned in the context of positive findings. However, whereas
PSMA is both quite sensitive and specific for nodal involvement,
it is clear that microscopic foci can be missed (26). Our PET/CT
lymphoscintigraphy technique could be used as an adjunct to de￾finitive surgery (after 68Ga-PSMA staging) for those men with a
high risk of microscopic nodal disease.
A weakness of our study was that we did not compare sensitiv￾ity and specificity of the PET tracer against a 99mTc-nanocolloid,
a fluorescent tracer, or a hybrid of these. The initial study
using 99mTc allowed us to validate our injection technique with￾out the time pressure associated with 68Ga, the short half-life of
which necessitates fairly rapid injection and imaging. We
aimed to test the feasibility of such a logistically complex pro￾cess before moving to an experimental arm. Because the study
was not used for clinical treatment planning, there were ethical
constraints on subjecting the patient to both PET/CT and
SPECT/CT imaging. In the future, such would be feasible with
coinjection of both tracers to confirm concordance of sentinel
node identification.
The technique we described is probably not practical for clinical
use because we perform it under general anesthetic and the 68-min
half-life of the gallium tracer means the PET scanner needs to
be available for use at a prescribed 30–100 min after injection—
a difficult requirement in a busy nuclear medicine department.
FIGURE 3. Volume-rendered PET/CT (left and right) images and axial PET/CT (middle) images.
After injection of tracer into prostate, imaging at 45 min demonstrated internal iliac SLN, inguinal
SLN, and focal uptake at terminal thoracic duct near entry into left subclavian vein. No intervening
SLN stations were seen in abdomen or chest. This intriguing finding correlates with increasing
recognition of Virchow nodal metastases visualized with 68Ga-PSMA or 18F-choline PET.
1840 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE • Vol. 59 • No. 12 • December 2018

Investigators were required to wheel the patient from the recov￾ery room directly to the PET scanner as soon as the patient had
adequately awakened from the anesthetic. The technique could
be adapted for transrectal injection to only 4 sites per patient,
which is thought to be optimal for SLN assessment in clinical
practice (4). For this anatomic study, we wanted to conscien￾tiously ensure that drainage from all regions of the prostate was
accounted for.
The use of 68Ga is timely in the context of rising interest in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (27). Like the 99mTc used for SPECT/CT
imaging, 68Ga is a generator-produced radioisotope, obviating the
cyclotron required for 18F PET imaging. 68Ga generators have a
shelf-life of 6–12 mo, compared with 2 wk for a 99mTc generator.
For centers performing 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, there is potential to
use the generator for sentinel node imaging as well. Interest in
68Ga radiotracers is rapidly growing because of the superior tem￾poral and spatial resolution of PET compared with conventional
SPECT imaging (7). In addition, the 68Ga radiation dose to the
patient is similar to the radiation dose of conventional imaging
because of its short half-life of 68 min. The use of an iron oxide
nanoparticle potentially also allows MRI, although this would
require a substantially higher particulate mass.
For lymphoscintigraphy, there are several potential advantages
of PET over SPECT. One is the ability to perform 3-dimensional
dynamic imaging. Although dynamic imaging is possible with
conventional nuclear medicine, it is limited to 2-dimensional
planar imaging. The slow speed of SPECT/CT means it is limited
to static rather than dynamic imaging. PET also enables rapid
whole-body 3D imaging, which in this small series enabled
identification of a Virchow second-echelon node. To date,
lymphoscintigraphy imaging is limited to simply showing poten￾tial pathways for metastatic spread rather than actual tumor spread.
CONCLUSION
Lymphoscintigraphy using a novel 68Ga-nanocolloid PET tracer
was successfully performed without observed side effects. In 3 of 5
participants, unexpected potential pathways for transit of malignant
cells were discovered, with rapid tracer drainage being identified to
pelvic bone and to perivesicular, mesorectal, inguinal, and Virchow
nodes. The prevalence of both aberrant and nonlymphatic pathways
of spread could be further investigated with this technique.
