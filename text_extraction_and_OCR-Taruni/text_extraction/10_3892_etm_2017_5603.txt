Abstract. Over 30 years have passed since co‑infection with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) was first documented in hemophilia patients in Japan. 
In such cases, the leading cause of mortality is reportedly 
HCV‑associated end‑stage liver disease. However, the current 
characteristics of hemophilia patients co‑infected with 
HIV/HCV are unknown. The aim of the present study was 
to reveal the current characteristics, notably HCV geno‑prev￾alence and liver function, among hemophilia patients 
co‑infected with HIV/HCV in Japan. Current characteristics 
were evaluated using cross‑sectional retrospective data of 44 
hemophilia patients positive for anti‑HCV and anti‑HIV anti￾bodies who underwent screening of liver dysfunction. A total 
of 56.8% of hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV 
were positive for HCV RNA. The most common HCV geno￾types were 1a, 1b and 3a. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 
26.3% patients negative for HCV RNA and 60.0% patients 
positive for HCV RNA. Decompensated liver cirrhosis was 
diagnosed in 33.3% HCV RNA‑positive patients and none of 
the HCV RNA‑negative patients. The rate of liver cirrhosis 
was greater for HCV genotype 3a compared with other geno￾types. Overall, the current primary HCV RNA genotypes 
among hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV are 
1a, 1b and 3a. Over 50% of HIV/HCV co‑infected hemo￾philia patients positive for HCV RNA were diagnosed with 
liver cirrhosis and some were diagnosed with decompensated 
liver cirrhosis.
Introduction
Hemophilia increases the risk of co‑infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
due to contaminated or unheated blood products (1,2). 
According to a survey by the National Institute of Infectious 
Diseases, 1,431 hemophilia patients in Japan were infected 
with HIV due to contaminated or unheated blood prod￾ucts and 95% were co‑infected with HCV (HIV/HCV 
co‑infected).
Over 30 years have passed since co‑infection with 
HIV/HCV was first documented in a hemophilia patient in 
Japan. It is well known that co‑infection with HIV/HCV is 
associated with a greater rate of rapid progression to liver 
cirrhosis and end‑stage liver disease (2‑5). Additionally, 
several studies have reported that the prognosis of hemo￾philia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV has continued 
to improve along with advancements in highly active 
anti‑retroviral therapy for HIV (6‑8), resulting in a shift in 
the leading cause of death to HCV‑associated end‑stage liver 
disease (1,2,9,10). Therefore, the degree of liver dysfunction 
mainly affects the prognosis of co‑infected hemophilia 
patients. However, there is currently limited data of HCV 
genoprevalence and liver function in co‑infected hemophilia 
patients in Japan. Hence, it is important to examine the 
current characteristics of these patients.
Since 2009, our hospital routinely screens for liver 
dysfunction among hemophilia patients who are positive for 
both anti‑HIV and anti‑HCV antibodies. The aim of this study 
was to reveal the current characteristics of hemophilia patients 
co‑infected with HIV/HCV.
Materials and methods
Study design and participants. The study protocol was approved 
by the Ethics Committee of Nagasaki University Graduate 
School of Biomedical Sciences (approval no. 1502271); all 
participants gave their informed consent prior to participation. 
We included 44 hemophilia patients who were positive for both 
anti‑HCV and anti‑HIV antibodies and admitted to Nagasaki 
University Hospital for screening of liver dysfunction from 
October 2009 to February 2014.

Hematochemical and serological tests were performed 
on admission. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens and anti￾bodies (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, and HBeAb) and HCV 
antibodies were tested using commercial immunoassays 
(Lumipulse, Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). 
HCV and HIV RNA levels were determined using poly￾merase chain reaction (PCR), and the presence of IL28B 
single‑nucleotide polymorphisms (rs8099917) was detected 
using pyrosequencing analysis (11). In addition, blood 
samples were collected from patients admitted between 
June 2012 and March 2014, and sera were extracted and 
frozen for future analysis. A diagnosis of underlying liver 
disease, such as liver cirrhosis, was based on blood param￾eters and findings of ultrasonography, dynamic computed 
tomography, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. History 
of previous anti‑HCV and anti‑HIV treatment were obtained 
from patient interview. The regimen of anti‑HIV therapy 
on admission were categorized to protease inhibitors 
(PI)‑unboosted combination with two nucleoside/nucleotide 
reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) (PI plus 2‑NRTI), 
PI‑boosted with two NRTI (Boosted PI plus 2‑NRTI), 
PI‑boosted with integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) 
(Boosted PI plus INSTI), PI‑boosted with two NRTI and 
INSTI (Boosted PI plus 2‑NRTI and INSTI), INSTI with 
two NRTI (INSTI plus 2‑NRTI), non‑nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with two NRTI (NNRTI 
plus 2‑NRTI), and others.
HCV genotyping. HCV genotyping was conducted on 
admission for a few patients positive for HCV RNA 
(HCV core genotype; SRL, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), whereas 
most were determined by phylogenic analysis of the 
HCV core region using sera that had been extracted and 
stored after admission. In brief, HCV RNA was extracted 
from serum using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and reverse transcription was 
performed with random primers using the SuperScript III 
First‑Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The HCV 
core region was amplified by nested PCR with specific 
primers (1st forward: 5'‑GGGAGGTCTCGTAGACCG
TGCACCATG‑3', 1st reverse: 5'‑GAGMGGKATRTA
CCCCATGAGRTCGGC‑3'; 2nd forward: 5'‑AGACCG
TGCACCATGAGCAC‑3', 2nd reverse: 5'‑TACGCCGGG
GGTCAKTRGGGCCCCA‑3'). After purification with 
the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), amplified 
PCR products were sequenced using the 3130 Genetic 
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Inc.) with the 2nd forward primer. To determine the HCV 
genotype, nucleotide sequence alignment and phylo￾genic analysis were performed using GENETYX ver.13 
(Genetyx Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with 278 bp of the 
HCV core region.
Statistical analysis. The Mann‑Whitney U test was used for the 
analysis of continuous ordinal data, and the Yates' corrected 
Chi‑square test was used to identify associations between 
qualitative variables. StatFlex ver. 6.0 software was used for 
all statistical analyses. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a 
statistically significant difference.
Results
Clinical characteristics of hemophilia patients co‑infected 
with HIV/HCV. All 44 patients in this study were males 
with a median age of 43.5 years (age range, 30‑68 years), 
of which 39 were diagnosed with hemophilia A and 5 with 
hemophilia B. Of these, 19 patients (43.2%) were negative 
for HCV RNA and 25 (56.8%) were positive (Fig. 1A). The 
median level of HCV RNA among the positive patients 
was 6.3 log IU/ml. After anti‑retroviral therapy, 37 patients 
(84.1%) were negative for HIV RNA, whereas 7 (15.9%) 
remained positive.
Characteristics of patients who were negative and posi￾tive for HCV RNA are shown in Table I. There was no 
significant difference in the ratio of median age between HCV 
RNA‑positive and ‑negative patients. Furthermore, there was 
no significant difference in the ratio of patients with prior 
HBV infection and those who were HIV RNA‑positive. White 
blood cell count, CD4 level, platelet count, and prothrombin 
activity were significantly lower in HCV RNA‑positive than 
in‑negative patients. Meanwhile, the level of alpha‑fetoprotein, 
aspartate transaminase (AST)‑platelet ratio index (APRI), and 
Fibrosis‑4 score (Fib4 score) were significantly higher in posi￾tive than in negative patients. The cause of these differences is 
assumed to result from the higher rate of liver cirrhosis among 
HCV RNA‑positive patients (Table II). There was no significant 
difference in the regimen of anti‑HIV therapy on admission. 
Among anti‑HIV therapy regimen, Boosted PI plus 2‑NRTI 
regimen were the most used in HCV RNA‑positive and nega￾tive patients. Interleukin (IL)28B was examined in 24 patients. 
There was no significant difference in the IL28B major allele 
(TT allele) ratio between HCV RNA‑positive and‑negative 
patients.
HCV RNA genotyping. HCV genotyping was performed for 
21 patients. HCV genotypes of four patients were determined 
by commercial HCV core PCR on admission. Two patients 
were classified as genotype 1a, one as 2a, and one as 3a. HCV 
genotypes of 17 patients were determined by phylogenic 
analysis of the HCV core region. According to the phylogenic 
tree shown in Fig. 1B, six patients were classified as geno￾type 1a, six as 1b, and five as 3a. Altogether, there were four 
genotypes, 38.1% (8/21) were genotype 1a, 28.6% (6/21) were 
genotype 1b, 4.8% (1/21) were genotype 2a, and 28.6% (6/21) 
were genotype 3a (Fig. 1C).
Previous anti‑HCV therapy in hemophilia patients co‑infected 
with HIV/HCV. Of 44 patients, 29 (65.9%) previously under￾went IFN‑based anti‑HCV therapy (Fig. 2). The contents of 
37 IFN‑based anti‑HCV therapies administered to 26 patients 
were obtained, whereas the contents of anti‑HCV therapy 
administered to three patients could not be obtained. Of the 
37 anti‑HCV therapies, 29.7% (11/37) were IFN mono‑therapy, 
which included IFN α‑2b and IFN β; 16.2% (6/37) were IFN 
plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy, which included 
IFN α‑2b/RBV; 13.5% (5/37) were pegylated IFN (PegIFN) 
mono‑therapy, which included PegIFN α‑2a and PegIFN α‑2b; 
and 40.5% (15/37) were PegIFN plus RBV combination therapy, 
which included PegIFN α‑2a/RBV and PegIFN α‑2b/RBV. 
Virus eradication was achieved in 48.3% (14/29) of patients. 

2150 EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE 15: 2148-2155, 2018
The sustained viral response rate of IFN mono‑therapy, IFN 
plus RBV therapy, PegIFN mono‑therapy, and PegIFN plus 
RBV therapy were 54.5% (6/11), 16.7% (1/6), 20% (1/5), and 
40.0% (6/15), respectively. Five of the 44 (11.4%) patients who 
did not receive IFN‑based anti‑HCV therapy were negative for 
HCV RNA. In these cases, HCV was believed to have spon￾taneously resolved, and the IL28B major allele was detected 
in each.
The ratio of liver cirrhosis in hemophilia patients co‑infected 
with HIV/HCV. Liver cirrhosis was detected in 20 (45.5%) 
patients on admission. The median age of these patients was 
43 years (age range, 30‑68 years). Five of 19 (26.3%) HCV 
RNA‑negative patients and 15 of 25 (60.0%) HCV RNA‑positive 
patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis (Figs. 2 and 3A). The 
ratio of liver cirrhosis was higher in HCV RNA‑positive patients 
than in HCV RNA‑negative patients. All HCV RNA‑negative 
patients with liver cirrhosis were Child‑Pugh grade A, whereas 
10 (66.7%), 2 (13.3%), and 3 (20.0%) HCV RNA‑positive patients 
were Child‑Pugh grades A, B and C, respectively (Fig. 3B). The 
ratio of liver cirrhosis for genotype 3a (83.3%) was relatively 
high compared with that for other genotypes, with the exception 
of genotype 2a (Fig. 3C). There was no significant difference 
in characteristics including the ratio of previous IFN therapy

Discussion
As of 1985, 1,431 hemophilia patients were infected with HIV 
in Japan, and 95% were co‑infected with HCV due to contami￾nated or unheated blood products. A recent national survey of 
blood coagulation disorders identified 643 living hemophilia 
patients with HIV/HCV co‑infection who had survived over 
30 years after infection. Although this cross‑sectional study 
was biased by the inclusion of subjects who were screened 
for liver dysfunction at their request, they were enrolled more 
recently (2009‑2014). Therefore, the results of this study reflect 
the current HCV genoprevalence and characteristics among 
hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV in Japan.
It was reported that genotype 1b was dominant (60‑70%) 
among HCV mono‑infected patients in Japan (12,13), 
whereas the most common HCV genotypes in hemophilia 
patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV were 1a, 1b, and 
Table I. Characteristics of study subjects negative and positive for HCV RNA.

3a (2,14). Although the current proportions of HCV geno￾types among hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV 
remains unknown, our data indicated that the major HCV 
RNA genotypes among hemophilia patients co‑infected with 
HIV/HCV were 1a, 1b, and 3a, which was unchanged from 
earlier reports. Until recently, many hemophilia patients 
co‑infected with HIV/HCV underwent IFN‑based anti‑HCV 
therapy and some achieved virus eradication. Considering 
that there have been few or no hemophilia patients newly 
co‑infected with HIV/ HCV, the current proportion of HCV 
genotype is probably affected by the effect of previous 
IFN‑based anti‑HCV therapy in each genotype. However, 
previous IFN‑based anti‑HCV therapy might not change the 
proportion of HCV genotypes. More detailed data are needed 
to clarify this issue.
Many studies have reported that co‑infection with HIV is 
a risk factor for progression to decompensated liver cirrhosis 
and end‑stage liver disease in hemophilia patients with 
HCV infection (2‑5). Fransen van de Putte et al reported 
that 22% of patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV developed 
end‑stage liver disease at a median follow‑up period of 
31 years in a retrospective study that included 212 patients

with inherited bleeding disorders and HIV/HCV co‑infec￾tion (15). Furthermore, they reported that HCV eradication 
limited progression to decompensated liver cirrhosis and 
end‑stage liver disease. It is difficult to confirm this findings 
in the present study because of the small number of cases and 
the timing of anti‑HCV therapy induction differed in each 
case. However, the findings of this study showed that the 
development of liver cirrhosis and progression to decompen￾sated liver cirrhosis were observed more often in hemophilia 
patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV and were positive for 
HCV RNA than in those who were negative for HCV RNA 
in accordance with previous findings.
It is interesting to note that the frequency of liver cirrhosis 
was greater in hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV 
genotype 3. Two meta‑analyses showed that HCV genotype 
3 was associated with rapid fibrosis progression (16,17). 
Probst et al (16) reported that the odds ratio for the associa￾tion of genotype 3 with accelerated fibrosis progression was 
1.52 in single‑biopsy studies and 1.37 in paired biopsy studies. 
Our observation is in agreement with these prior findings. 
On the other hand, the frequency of patients co‑infected with 
HIV/HCV genotype 3a who underwent IFN therapy was 50.0% 
(3/6) in this study, which was lower than that with genotype 1a 
(62.5%, 5/8) and genotype 1b (66.6%, 4/6). The absence of prior

among 19 hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV/HCV, but negative for HCV RNA (left column), and 25 patients positive for HCV RNA (right column). The 
vertical axis indicates all cases, which are divided into non‑liver cirrhosis cases (white bar) and liver cirrhosis cases (black bar). The horizontal axis indicates 
age on admission. Previous IFN therapy episodes are shown on a bar graph with the therapy induction age. The black arrow, outlined arrow, black arrow head, 
and white arrow head indicates interferon monotherapy (IFN monotherapy), interferon plus ribavirin therapy (IFN/RBV), pegylated interferon monotherapy 
(PegIFN monotherapy), and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy (PegIFN/RBV), respectively. The determined HCV genotypes of HCV RNA‑positive 
cases are shown on the right side of the bar graph.

IFN therapy might have contributed to the high frequency of 
liver cirrhosis in this study.
As shown in Fig. 2, hemophilia patients co‑infected with 
HIV/HCV genotype 3 were relatively older. The median age 
of patients with genotype 1a/1b was 40.5 years, whereas the 
median age of those with genotype 3a was 48 years. The ratio 
of patients <40 years was 50.0% (7/14) and 16.7% (1/6) with 
genotype 1a/1b and 3a, respectively. It is possible that more 
hemophilia patients co‑infected with HIV and HCV genotype 
3 were ineligible for IFN‑based anti‑HCV therapy because of 
older age and fibrosis progression. Further, these characters 
might be correlated with the fact that the current ratio of 
HCV genotype 3a did not decrease, although sustained viral 
response rate in the patients infected with HCV genotype 3 was 
higher than that with HCV genotype 1a/1b (18,19). However, 
this study was biased by the inclusion of subjects admitted 
to a university hospital because of uncommon infections and 
refractory HCV genotype 3 with liver fibrosis progression. In 
addition, the genotypes of patients who achieved a sustained 
viral response have to be investigated in future studies.
In conclusion, the major HCV RNA genotypes among 
hemophilia patients with HIV/HCV co‑infection are currently 
1a, 1b, and 3a, which did not seem to change from previous 
reports. More than half of hemophilia patients with HIV/HCV 
co‑infection and those positive for HCV RNA developed liver 
cirrhosis and some developed decompensated liver cirrhosis.
