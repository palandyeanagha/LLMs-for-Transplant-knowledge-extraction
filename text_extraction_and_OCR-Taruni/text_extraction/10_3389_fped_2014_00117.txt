INTRODUCTION
Cystic fibrosis (CT) is a genetically inher￾ited, multisystem condition, resulting from
abnormal salt and water transport across
epithelial surfaces. Advances in medical
treatments have resulted in vastly improved
care of CF patients. This has led to the
increased survival of CF sufferers from
early childhood in the 1940s to nearly
40 years of age in 2012 (1). These therapies
include nebulized and inhaled mucolytics,
and bronchodilators, as well as prophylac￾tic antibiotics and physiotherapy. Most CF
patients require some form of long-term
venous access for ease of administration of
repeated courses of intravenous antibiotics.
Some of our patients are fitted with a totally
implantable venous access device (TIVAD)
referred to as a Port-A-Cath. Over time,
these indwelling devices present their own
complications. We report a series of three
patients with potentially life-threatening
thrombotic and thromboembolic phe￾nomena arising from their indwelling cen￾tral venous catheters (CVCs).
CASE 1
A 16-year-old Caucasian female CT
(∆F508/∆F508) patient with pancreatic
insufficiency and CF-related diabetes mel￾litus presented to our unit 2 years post￾right-sided chest Port-A-Cath (indwelling
CVC) insertion. She had developed acute
hemoptysis and epistaxis with associated
pleuritic chest pains. On auscultation of
her chest, air entry was equal with no local￾ized crepitations. Her pulmonary func￾tion tests revealed an FEV1 of 0.58 (23%)
and an FEF of 25–75.17 (7%). These
measurements were reasonably close to her
baseline. A chest X-Ray revealed no evi￾dence of pneumothorax. Her full blood
count and coagulation screen were normal.
Her symptoms resolved spontaneously and
she was discharged.
A month later, her Port-A-Cath devel￾oped complete resistance on flushing dur￾ing routine home intravenous antibiotics.
A venogram showed a small thrombus
at the tip of her Port-A-Cath, causing
no obstruction. The patient was asympto￾matic. An echocardiogram was performed
4 days later and revealed a very large, well￾organized right atrial thrombus at the level
of the tricuspid valve, attached to the Port￾A-Cath tip (see Figure 1A). The right
ventricle appeared normal.
Her coagulation screen was repeated
and remained normal. However, her Anti￾Factor Xa level was low 0.02. Thrombolytic
therapy was initiated with Alteplase 2 mg
instilled into her venous catheter for 4-h
periods and she was commenced on a 4-
week course of tinzaparin 175 units/kg/day.
CASE 2
An 18-year-old Caucasian male CF
patient (∆F508/G551D) with pancre￾atic insufficiency, CF-related liver disease,
and impaired glucose tolerance had an
indwelling CVC inserted into his right
internal jugular vein. This was his eighth
catheter in 7 years. A week post-insertion,
it was noted to be difficult to draw blood
from this catheter. A venogram was subse￾quently performed, which showed a right
internal jugular venous thrombus, with very
poor flow through his right subclavian
and external jugular veins. The catheter
was removed and a right femoral venous
catheter was inserted under radiological
guidance with difficulty due to poor venous
flow. He was treated with anti-coagulants.
Less than a week later, he devel￾oped acute dyspnea, and a progressively
increasing oxygen requirement. Examina￾tion of his chest revealed scattered crepita￾tions bilaterally with no focal crepitations
detected. His femoral venous catheter was
no longer functioning, leaving the patient
with no venous access.
On pulmonary function testing, his
FEV1 was 16% and his FVC was 31%,
both slightly below baseline. The rest of
his routine bloods including coagulation
screen were normal. A chest X-Ray was
performed, which showed no pneumoth￾orax. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)
was scheduled, but was unable to be per￾formed due to the complete lack of patent
venous access. A VQ scan was considered
for suspected pulmonary emboli. However,
upon discussion, this was also deemed
impractical due to the patient’s lack of
venous access. He was commenced on ther￾apeutic enoxaparin sodium (Clexane) at
1 mg/kg/bd SC, which was monitored with
anti-Factor Xa levels.
CASE 3
A 15-year-old Caucasian male with
G551D/n CT,pancreatic insufficiency and a
PEG in situ presented to hospital with dys￾pnea, a non-productive cough and reduced
exercise tolerance. His oxygen saturations
were 88% in room air. There were no focal
crepitations detected and air entry was

equal bilaterally. His routine blood results
were all within the normal ranges including
a coagulation screen. No pneumothorax
was noted on chest X-Ray. His chest Port￾A-Cath appeared to be functioning well.
He was admitted and intravenous antibi￾otics were commenced. A high-resolution
CT scan showed chronic CT changes and
right-sided volume loss.
Subsequently, a CTPA was performed.
This revealed bilateral arterial filling defects
with a prominent azygos vein, indicat￾ing elevated right atrial pressure (see
Figure 1B).
His venogram showed normal central
line flow with complete obstruction of the
right subclavian vein and multiple collateral
filling defects (see Figure 1C).
His D-dimers 3 days post-admission
were elevated to 1.26. He was commenced
on warfarin 5 mg/kg, low-molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) × 5/7, and low-dose
ADEK for right subclavian vein thrombosis
and possible pulmonary emboli.
DISCUSSION
Intravenous antibiotics are the mainstay
of treatment for infective exacerbations of
CF. However, intravenous cannulation is
recognized as a fear-inducing and often
traumatic process for children, particularly
as repeated attempts at cannulation are
often necessary in patients with a chronic
illness. It follows that obtaining venous
access by the least traumatic and most
effective means is an important aspect of
the management of children who require
repeated courses of intravenous antibi￾otics. TIVADs were originally utilized in
the treatment of oncology patients. The use
of TIVADs in children with CF was first
described in 1986 (2). These devices require
minimal care, do not limit physical activ￾ity and are relatively tamper-proof (3). In
addition, they are cosmetically acceptable
and allow ease of access to large, central
veins, which are more likely to withstand
repeated courses of intravenous treatment.
Thrombotic and thromboembolic com￾plications of TIVADs have been widely
reported. These range from microthrombi
occluding the tip of venous catheters to
potentially life-threatening venous throm￾bosis (VTs), occasionally, resulting in
pulmonary and paradoxical emboli. In
1997, Deerojanawong et al. reported a
symptomatic VT rate of 9% in CF patients
in Melbourne, VIC, Australia (3). Munck
et al. indicated a thrombosis rate of 4.7% in
2004 (4) and in 2008, a retrospective review
over 20 years of a single center in Birming￾ham, England reported 5 cases of VT in
105 patients (165 TIVADs) (5). Several case
reports of paradoxical embolization have
been reported in adult CF patients (6–8)
and one in an 11-year-old CF sufferer (9).
The placement of TIVADs itself is felt to
induce a pro-thrombotic response through
local inflammation and the presence of for￾eign material intravascularly. In addition to
these acquired mechanical risk factors, VT

Kandamany et al. Detection of thrombosis in cystic fibrosis
in CF patients is felt to be in part due to
underlying abnormalities of coagulation.
The tendency toward hypercoagulabil￾ity in CF patients has been a subject
of much research. Takemoto et al. sug￾gest that in addition to CVCs, acquired
thrombophilia secondary to inflammation
and deficiencies of anticoagulant proteins
due to vitamin K or liver dysfunction are
likely to contribute to the increased risk of
thrombosis in CF (10). Furthermore, chil￾dren with CF appear to have a higher fre￾quency of protein C and S deficiencies than
expected for inherited deficiencies (11).
Deficiencies in both these proteins are pos￾sibly due to vitamin K deficiency or hepatic
dysfunction (12). Balfour-Lynn et al. also
reported greater than expected rates of pro￾tein C deficiency (4 vs. 0.2–0.4%) and pro￾tein S deficiency (5 vs. 0.3%) in addition
to anti-thrombin deficiency (1 vs. 0.2%)
and lupus anticoagulant deficiency (9 vs.
1–5%) in CF patients compared to the gen￾eral population (13). This study of 204 CF
patients was conducted in asymptomatic
patients in an out-patient setting, and thus,
did not investigate levels in patients with
confirmed VT. Another study of 71 patients
concurred with Balfour-Lynn et al. report￾ing elevated rates of lupus anti-coagulants
(18%), protein C deficiency (14%), and
protein S deficiency (19.7%) (14). Anti￾phospholipid antibody levels have also
been noted to be raised in children with
CF (4–9.5 vs. 1–3%) (15, 16). In addi￾tion, VT has been reported at a rate of
27% in those with Burkholderia Cepa￾cia colonization, though the exact mech￾anism of this relationship has not been
ascertained (12).
Symptoms of thrombotic complications
in CF patients may mimic those of infec￾tive pulmonary exacerbations, thus, caus￾ing a delay in diagnosis. Two of the
patients in our case series presented with an
increased oxygen requirement and progres￾sively worsening dyspnea, both common
symptoms of lower respiratory tract infec￾tions in CF patients. The other patient in
our case series presented with hemopty￾sis, also a symptom seen frequently in CF
patients, due to chronic lung inflamma￾tion. One of our patients had a normally
functioning indwelling CVC, but was only
noted on venogram to have developed a
complete obstruction of his right subcla￾vian vein. This suggests that the ease of
blood flow from an indwelling catheter is
not a reliable gage of venous patency due
to the potential for the development of
collaterals.
While TIVADs are not the sole risk
factor for VTs in CF patients, the risk
of venous thromboembolism (VTE) does
increase with the duration of the CVCs
(4). Following a multicentre, prospective
cohort study of 80 patients, Dal Molin et al.
reported a mean of 203.6 days between
TIVAD positioning and the onset of throm￾bosis (17). The age of first diagnosis of CF is
decreasing and given the recent introduc￾tion of newborn screening for CF in our
patient population, it follows that patients
will be fitted with their first TIVAD at an
earlier age, which increases the chances
of long-term complications by the time
they reach adolescence. Therefore, it is our
opinion that there is a need for more
stringent screening for thrombotic and
thromboembolic complications from an
earlier age.
In a recent prospective, multicenter,
observational study assessing central VTs
and thrombophilia in CF, Munck et al.
demonstrated a 50% hypercoagulability
rate and a 6.6% catheter-related VT rate.
Interestingly, patients who had previously
had a central line were noted to have a 9.1%
rate of catheter-related VT on Doppler
ultrasound (prior to TIVAD insertion).
Five out of six patients were asympto￾matic at the time of diagnosis of VT using
Doppler ultrasound; 4 prior to TIVAD
insertion, 1 at 1-month follow-up scan,
and 1 at 6-month follow-up scan. Munck
et al. concluded that laboratory throm￾bophilia screening was poorly predictive
and thus not recommended routinely in
patients prior to TIVAD insertion, but that
a focused medical history (assessing for
thrombotic risk factors) and prospective
Doppler US scans might be useful in iden￾tifying asymptomatic catheter VT (18).
Given the evidence we have reviewed, we
suggest that an extended coagulation panel
(incorporating at a minimum, protein C,
protein S, anti-thrombin, and factor VIII
and factor V Leiden levels) and Doppler
ultrasound screening be conducted at reg￾ular intervals in patients with TIVADs who
have had a history of a VT, as well as
prior to TIVAD insertion. Patients at risk
for VT (family history of hypercoagula￾bility, oral contraception, etc.) will need
close surveillance and the role of Doppler
ultrasound should be considered in these
cases.
Several studies researching the benefit
of thromboprophylaxis in CF patients have
been conducted. In 1992, Sola et al. rec￾ommended the prophylactic use of aspirin
in all CF patients without evidence of
liver disease or coagulopathy (19). There
has been no efficacy shown for prophy￾laxis with low-dose warfarin therapy (INR
1.3–1.9) to prevent CVC-associated throm￾bosis. Of particular, concern is the risk
of hemoptysis, which is associated with
CF (20).
All three of our patients developed their
thrombotic complications despite the use
of recommended flushing using the “stop
and go” technique. While local guidelines
prevail at each CF center, it is accepted
that local CVC obstructions secondary to
fibrin sheaths may be managed with infu￾sions of thrombolytics such a tPA in the
first instance, and do not warrant systemic
anticoagulation (10). Acute, symptomatic
DVT associated with central lines should
be managed initially with heparin ther￾apy then removed after 3–5 days or until
a therapeutic level of anticoagulation is
achieved to reduce the risk of emboliza￾tion (21) The optimum duration of treat￾ment has not been extensively studied, but
Munck et al. recommended 3–6 months
of anticoagulation for patients with CVC￾related thrombosis (4). There has also
been a move toward using peripherally
inserted central catheters (PICCs) in CF
patients, which are not without their own
complications.
In conclusion, the marked improvement
in the early detection and survival of CF
patients has seen a concomitant rise in chal￾lenges faced by late childhood and early
adolescence in this group of patients. We
believe our case series highlights an impor￾tant phenomenon that is likely to feature
more prominently as the average age of
CF survivors increases. Presently, there is
no clear consensus as to whether to rou￾tinely screen CF patients to identify those
at risk for significant thrombosis prior to
the development of VT. Our recommen￾dation that those who have a history of a
previous VT and those with a significant
family history of this should potentially
undergo an extended thrombophilia screen
is based on the best available evidence.

Kandamany et al. Detection of thrombosis in cystic fibrosis
The use of directed Doppler ultrasound
prior to TIVAD insertion, and at fixed
intervals thereafter, may help identify the
formation of catheter-related VT prospec￾tively. Thromboprophylaxis cannot be rec￾ommended routinely at this stage. We
strongly feel this is an area that would
benefit from larger and more robust stud￾ies to achieve early identification of CF
patients who are at risk for serious throm￾botic and thromboembolic complications
arising from their indwelling central
lines.
