Kidney stone disease

About 5% of American women and 12% of men will develop a kidney stone at some time in their
life, and prevalence has been rising in both sexes. Approximately 80% of stones are composed of
calcium oxalate (CaOx) and calcium phosphate (CaP); 10% of struvite (magnesium ammonium
phosphate produced during infection with bacteria that possess the enzyme urease), 9% of uric
acid (UA); and the remaining 1% are composed of cystine or ammonium acid urate or are diag￾nosed as drug-related stones. Stones ultimately arise because of an unwanted phase change of
these substances from liquid to solid state. Here we focus on the mechanisms of pathogenesis
involved in CaOx, CaP, UA, and cystine stone formation, including recent developments in our understanding of
related changes in human kidney tissue and of underlying genetic causes, in addition to current therapeutics.
Clinical aspects of stone disease
Stone passage
Nonobstructing stones produce no symptoms or signs apart from
hematuria. Stone passage produces renal colic that usually begins
as a mild discomfort and progressesto a plateau of extreme severity
over 30–60 minutes. If the stone obstructs the uretero-pelvic junc￾tion, pain localizesto the flank; asthe stone moves down the ureter,
pain moves downward and anterior. Stones at the uretero-vesicular
junction often cause dysuria and urinary frequency mistaken for
infection. Colic is independent of body position or motion and is
described as a boring or burning sensation associated with nau￾sea and vomiting. Stones less than 5 mm in diameter have a high
chance of passage; those of 5–7 mm have a modest chance (50%) of
passage, and those greater than 7 mm almost always require uro￾logical intervention. Ideally,stone analysisis performed by infrared
spectroscopy or x-ray diffraction. Renalstone burden is best gauged
using CT radiographs taken with 5-mm cuts, without infusion of
contrast agents. The radiographic appearance and density ofstones
as measured by CT is a guide to their composition (1).
Urological management of stones
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), in which sound
waves are used to break the stone into small pieces that can
more easily pass into the bladder, is widely used and valuable
for small stones (2). Modern instruments facilitate passage of
endoscopes up the ureter into the kidney pelvis and permit
local stone disruption with high-powered lasers (3). Percutane￾ous stone removal via instruments introduced into the kidney
through a small flank incision permits disruption and removal
of even very large stones (4).
Renal function of stone forming people is reduced
Within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
III data set, subjects with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 who
had kidney stones had lower estimated glomerular filtration rates
than non–stone formers (non-SFs) matched for age, sex, race, and
BMI (5). SFs also have higher blood pressures than non-SFs (6).
Obstruction of the urinary tract, sequelae of urological interven￾tions, and the processes that cause stone formation may all injure
renal tissue, reduce renal function, and raise blood pressure.
Determinants of phase change
Supersaturation
Stones result from a phase change in which dissolved salts con￾dense into solids, and all phase changes are driven by supersatura￾tion (SS), which is usually approximated for such salts by the ratio
of their concentration in the urine to their solubilities (7) and cal￾culated by computer algorithms. At SS values less than 1, crystals
of a substance will dissolve; at SS values greater than 1, crystals
can form and grow. As expected, the composition of stones that
patientsform correlateswith SS valuesfrom the urine they produce
(8). Although increasing urine volume is an obvious way to lower
SS, patients examined in a variety of practice settings have been
found to be able to increase their urine volume by an average of
only 0.3 l/d (9). Moreover, for unclear reasons, sodium intake and
urinary calcium excretion has been found to increasewith increased
urine volume, partly offsetting the fall in SS. Along with urine vol￾ume, urine calcium and oxalate concentrations are the main deter￾minants of calcium oxalate (CaOx) SS; urine calcium concentration
and pH are the main determinants of calcium phosphate (CaP) SS;
and urinary pH is the main determinant of uric acid (UA) SS.
The upper limit of metastability
Urine with SS greater than 1 is referred to as metastable because
the excess dissolved material, being present at a concentration
above its solubility, must eventually precipitate. One can add
oxalate or calcium to urine and note the SS needed to produce a
solid phase of CaOx or CaP. That value, called the upper limit of
metastability (ULM), varies with urine SS (10) and islower among
patients with stones than in matched control subjects (11). This
suggests that mechanisms that normally protect against solid￾phase development are less effective in patients with stones than
healthy individuals. Urine contains molecules that retard the for￾Nonstandard abbreviations used: b0,+AT, b0,+ amino acid transporter; BM,

mation of solid CaOx and CaP phases (12), and it is precisely this
retardation that can permit the transient existence of SS. The
measurement of ULM is not currently used in clinical practice.
Modulators of the ULM, crystal growth, and aggregation
Urine citrate reduces SS by binding calcium and inhibits nucleation
and growth of calcium crystals (13); it is measured clinically, and
low levels are treated as a cause of stones. Osteopontin (14), pro￾thrombin F1 fragment (15), the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor molecule
(16), calgranulin (17), Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein (18), as well as
albumin, RNA and DNA fragments, and glycosaminoglycans have
all been identified as urine inhibitors of CaOx and CaP crystalliza￾tion (12). They have in common long stretches of polyanion chains
that can bond with surface calcium atoms and prevent crystal
growth. Such blockade prevents measurable phase changes and
raisesthe ULM because newly formed crystals cannot grow beyond
extremely minute dimensions. These molecules also prevent clump￾ing of small particles into larger ones (aggregation). Because we
do not know which, if any, of these molecules contribute to stone
pathogenesis, they are presently of great research interest.
CaOx stones
The vast majority of CaOx SFs suffer from no systemic disease
and as such are described as idiopathic CaOx SFs. Some have
primary hyperparathyroidism or other disorders of calcium
metabolism, and others present with hyperoxaluria because of
bowel disease (enteric hyperoxaluria) and genetic disorders of
oxalate metabolism (primary hyperoxaluria [PH]). We discuss
these groups separately below.
Pathogenesis of idiopathic CaOx stones
Stones form on interstitial apatite plaque. CaOx stonesform on the sur￾faces of the renal papillae over collections of interstitialsuburothe￾lial CaP particles(19) named Randall plaque. The number of CaOx
stones formed, adjusted for duration of stone formation, varies
directly with plaque surface coverage (20), as would be expected if
plaque were a surface that promotes CaOx overgrowth.
Plaque begins in the basement membranes of the thin Henle loops. Base￾ment membrane (BM) plaque comprises a myriad of particles in
which crystal and organic layers alternate (Figure 1, A and B); the
outersurface of all particlesisthe organic layer(Figure 1, B andC).
The crystal in plaque is always biological apatite, the miner￾al phase found in bone. Outside the BM, in the interstitium,

BM of thin Henle loops and not in nearby inner medullary CDs. By TEM 
(B and C), the crystal deposits appear as single spheres with a multi￾laminated (6–7 layers) internal morphology consisting of a central light 
region of crystalline material surrounded by a dark layer of matrix material 
(arrows). Note that the cells lining this Henle loop appear morphological￾ly normal. Osteopontin (D) localizes on either side of the apatite layers, 
sometimes forming with a clear “tram track”–like appearance (arrows).

plaque particles coalesce so that islands of crystal float in an
organic sea (Figure 2). It is this coalescent material that extends
to the suburothelial region and over which CaOx stones grow.
The identity of the organic molecules surrounding apatite in
plaque are unknown except for osteopontin, which coats the
surface of apatite and positions itself (Figure 1D) precisely at
the apatite organic layer interface (21). We envision that plaque
forms in the thin limb BM and extends to the suburothelial
space and that CaOx stones then form over the organic coating
of apatite particles.
Crystals are not found in tubule lumens of the deep or outer medulla or cor￾tex.The lining cellsofthe tubules arenormalinappearance (Figure2)
even when deposits of plaque fill the BM; no lumen crystals have
to date been found in tissue from idiopathic CaOx SFs. For this
reason, we do not review here the large literature on attachment of
CaOx and CaP crystalsto renal epithelial cellsin culture (22),which
does not appear to be relevant to human idiopathic CaOx stone
disease. Interstitial cells also show no evident pathology.
Mechanisms of plaque and stone formation. The driving force for
CaOx overgrowth on plaque is urine CaOx SS. But the forces that
create the plaque are not so clear. The fraction of papillary surface
covered by plaque in idiopathic CaOx SFs correlates directly with
urine calcium level and inversely with urine volume and pH (23).
Given that the initial formation isin the thin Henle loops BM, effi￾cient water extraction in the collecting duct (CD) combined with
high deliveries of calcium as a result of idiopathic hypercalciuria
(IH) may increase tubule and interstitial calcium concentrations
and by as-yet-undetermined mechanismsstimulate apatite deposi￾tion in the thin-limb BM.
Clinical implications. High fluid intake may be beneficial not only
to prevent CaOx overgrowth, but also to reduce plaque formation
itself. Thiazide diuretics, which lower urine calcium, may reduce
plaque as well as urine CaOx SS, whereas measures that reduce
urine oxalate concentration are important in prevention of over￾growth but have no apparentrole with regard to plaque formation.
As new technologies permit visualization and quantification of
plaque in the kidneys of patients, effects of treatments on plaque
may become a matter for prospective trials.
Idiopathic hypercalciuria
Urinary calcium excretion as measured on random diets varies
in humans (24), and excretion rates among idiopathic CaOx SFs
cluster at the high end of this distribution (25). Lowering uri￾nary calcium levels prevents stone recurrence (12). Conventional
upper limits of 250 mg/d (for women) and 300 mg/d (for men)
are near the 95th percentiles for our published data sets (26) and
are commonly used as diagnostic cutpoints. We believe SFs in the
70th percentiles (170 mg/d for women and 210 mg/d for men)

may well benefit from lower calcium excretion rates. Data link￾ing calcium excretion to stone risk (27) are supportive of the idea
that it is a graded risk factor.
Diagnosis of IH requires exclusion of hypercalcemia, vitamin D
excess, hyperthyroidism, malignant neoplasm, and sarcoidosis.
Pathogenesis and systemic manifestations of IH are well described
in standard textbooks (12). About 50% of first-degree relatives of
people whose urinary calcium excretion level exceeds the 95th
percentile also surpass these limits, establishing the familial and
therefore inherited nature of IH. We emphasize here the most
salient features and new research concerning this condition.
On average, patients with IH have higher than normal serum
levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) and increased intestinal
absorption of calcium (28), and vitamin D receptor expression
on circulating blood monocytes may also be increased. High
intestinal calcium absorption can raise the load of filtered cal￾cium presented to the renal tubules. The reabsorption of filtered
calcium by the renal tubules may also be reduced. Either mecha￾nism can increase urinary calcium level, which can be further
increased by glucose or sucrose loads (29), high sodium intake
(30), and a high-protein diet (31). Although dietary calcium is
the main contributor to high urinary calcium levels in IH, low￾calcium diets are not widely used clinically because they are not
of proven effectiveness in stone prevention (32) and may predis￾pose to reduced bone mineral content (33). Thiazide diuretics
lower urinary calcium levels and promote positive bone mineral
balances (34), and multiple prospective trials have documented
their effectiveness for preventing calcium stones (see “Treatment
trials: stone recurrence outcomes”).
Monogenic disorders that cause hypercalciuria and stones
These rare disorders illustrate links among genetic variation, uri￾nary calcium excretion, and calcium stones. Two recent reviews
(35, 36) have detailed all known mutations that can cause hyper￾calciuria in humans or animals; here we discuss only those that
cause stones in humans. We have excluded mere gene associa￾tions with the presence of stones, with the single exception of a
cytosolic soluble adenylyl cyclase.
Dent disease. This X-linked hypercalciuric stone-forming disor￾der (Table 1) is due to mutations in the gene that codes for the
voltage-gated endosomal chloride channel 5 (CLCN5) (37–39).
Resultant low-molecular-weight proteinuria includes para￾thyroid hormone (PTH) loss (40, 41). As in IH, hypercalciuria
results from increased serum calcitriol levels (42), and thiazide
treatment lowers urine calcium concentrations (43). Because
some patients with Dent disease lack CLCN5 (44) mutations,
other genetic defects may also contribute to this disease. CLCN5
mutations are rarely found in IH patients (45). Gene KO studies
in mice suggest that defective proximal tubule (PT) endocyto￾sis increases PT lumen PTH levels, which activates 1α-hydroxy￾lase and raises serum calcitriol levels, causing hypercalciuria
(46, 47). In one study of Clcn5-KO mice (48), urinary 25OHD3
levels were high, serum levels of 25OHD3 and calcitriol were

low, and urine calcium concentration was normal; urinary loss
of 25OHD3 was thought to limit the increase in calcitriol from
high lumen PTH.
Bartter syndromes. Of the 5 major genetic variants associated with
Barttersyndrome (49), cortical andmedullary renal calcifications(50)
are found in patients with Barttersyndrome typesI and II (Table 1),
which arise from transport defects that reduce thick ascending
limb (TAL) NaCl and calcium reabsorption, creating hypercalciuria.
Defectsin a TAL basolateral membrane chloride channel, CLCNKB,
produce only variable hypercalciuria and uncommon crystal depos￾its(type III). Defectsin a chloride channelsubunit known as Barttin,
encoded by BSND, produce Barttersyndrome type IV, inwhich deaf￾ness, but neither stones nor nephrocalcinosis, are observed. Loop
diuretic treatment of premature babies, a pharmacological analog of
the reduced TAL reabsorption seen in Barttersyndromes, can cause
renal calcifications, 50% of which regress over time (51).
Abnormalities of the calcium-sensing receptor. The calcium-sensing
receptor (CaSR) regulates PTH secretion in response to blood calci￾um levels(52) and is also present on the apical membranes of PTand
medullary CD principal cells and the basal membranes of TAL and
distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells, where it regulates transport
functions. Gain-of-function mutations of the CaSR reduce serum
PTH levels andTAL and DCTcalcium reabsorption (53, 54), causing
variably symptomatic hypocalcemia (55–57)with lowserum PTHlev￾els. Stones usually result from calcium and vitamin D administered
inorderto raise serumcalciumlevels.Oneparticularmutationcauses
multigland primary hyperparathyroidism (58).Asevere gain-of-func￾tion defect of the CaSR causes Bartter syndrome type V (Table 1),
and its clinical symptoms are ascribed to CaSR activation–medi￾ated downregulation of a renal outer medullary potassium channel
(ROMK) that is mutated in type II Barttersyndrome (59, 60).
Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.
Paracellin-1, a member of the claudin family (61, 62) found only in
the TAL and DCT, is essential for normal, voltage-driven paracellu￾lar magnesium reabsorption in the TAL. Patients with paracellin-1
defects develop hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, polyuria, neph￾rocalcinosis,stones, distalrenal tubular acidosis(dRTA), and renal
failure (Table 1). A striking incidence of hypercalciuria and stones
has been found in heterozygous family members (63).

soluble adenylyl cyclase [hsAC]) (65), 4 base changes segregated with
IH, and bone mineral density decreased as the number of base
changes increased. hsAC is a cytosolic enzyme sensitive to bicar￾bonate concentration in the presence of divalent cations and could
explain bicarbonate sensitivity of renal and bone cells (66).
Primary hyperparathyroidism
Clinicians readily distinguish this stone-forming condition from
IH because blood calcium levels are high in primary hyperparathy￾roidism and normal in IH. The two disorders share hypercalciuria
and generally elevated serum levels of calcitriol. Diagnosis, patho￾genesis, treatment approaches, and the genes related to gland
enlargement have been well covered elsewhere (67).
Hyperoxaluria
Urine oxalate concentration affects CaOx SS exactly as does urine
calcium concentration (68); therefore, any conditionsthat increase
oxalate absorption from food or lead to increased oxalate produc￾tion can cause CaOx stone formation.
Dietary hyperoxaluria in idiopathic CaOx SFs.Whereasthe 95thpercen￾tilesfor urinary oxalate excretion forfemales and males are 45 mg/d
and 55 mg/d, respectively, and the corresponding 70th percentiles
are 31 mg/d and 41 mg/d (12), values up to approximately 80 mg/d
are common among idiopathicCaOx SFs and are often unexplained
by a systemic cause (69). A low-calcium dietthatreduces CaOx crys￾tallization in the gutlumen,thereby facilitating oxalate ion absorp￾tion, is easily identified and corrected (70). High protein or oxalate
intake are other causes ofthis condition (71, 72). Oxalate absorption
from food may depend upon gastrointestinal transporters (73, 74),
and genetic variationsin oxalate transporting proteinsin red blood
cells have been linked to CaOx stone formation (73).
Enteric hyperoxaluria. If colon is present and receiving small bowel
effluent, fat malabsorption of any cause (e.g., small bowel disease,
resection or bypass, or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) results
in increased colon oxalate absorption and urine oxalate excretion
in the range of 80–140 mg/d (69). Undigested fatty acids promote
colon oxalate absorption (75). Diarrheal fluid losses and low
urine pH and citrate levels resulting from stool bicarbonate losses
increase urine CaOx SS and UA SS; stones usually contain 1 or
both of these phases (69).
Among patients with enteric hyperoxaluria resulting from small
bowel bypassfor the treatment of obesity (19),some terminal CDs
are plugged with apatite crystals(Figure 3) and show epithelial cell
death and surrounding interstitial inflammation. How the apatite
plugs form remains unknown; possibly high oxalate concentra￾tions in tubule fluid injure epithelial cells and disturb pH regula￾tion so that lumen pH increases. Plugging and consequent neph￾ron damage may account for renal function loss in such patients
and may benefit from urine dilution.
Treatment involves high fluid intake and reducing dietary oxa￾late and fat intake to the extent that nutritional requirement
guidelines permit. Calcium supplements (500–1,000 mg) taken
with each meal can bind food oxalate and hinder absorption. Cho￾lestyramine (2–4 g with each meal) binds oxalate and fatty acids
and reduces urine oxalate excretion. If stones contain UA, potas￾sium alkali is needed to increase urine pH (76). No formal trials
have validated these treatment approaches.
Primary hyperoxaluria.Mutationsin 1 of 2 genes —AGXT orGRHPR
(77) — leads to oxalate overproduction and urine oxalate excretion
rates above 100 mg/d or even 200 mg/d, resulting in PH (Table 2).
When gene alterations divert active enzyme into mitochondria,
where it cannot function effectively, pyridoxine may reduce urine
oxalate concentration by increasing enzyme activity (78). When loss￾of-function mutationsinactivate enzymes, actively increasing urine
volume and perhaps treatment with orthophosphate supplements
may be advised (79). In type I PH, renal failure is frequent and pres￾ently treated by combined segmental liver and renaltransplantation
(80). Type II PH, being milder,seldom causesrenal failure.
Hypocitraturia
The 30th percentiles for urine citrate excretion in normal women
and men, 424 mg/d and 384 mg/d (26), respectively, correspond
well with usual criteria for hypocitraturia (less than 500 mg/d for
women and less than 350 mg/d for men). We have already alluded
to the role of citrate in binding calcium and inhibiting calcium
crystallization (see “Modulators of the ULM, crystal growth, and
aggregation”),so it is reasonable to presume that low urine citrate
levels could permit CaOx stones.
Regulation of urine citrate. Urine citrate concentration is deter￾mined mainly by tubule reabsorption (81), which is increased by
acid loads and reduced by alkali loads. Therefore, states of alkali
loss such as intestinal malabsorption with diarrhea or any cause
of metabolic acidosis reduce urine citrate level (82, 83). Potassium
depletion, a common consequence of thiazide intake, also low￾ers urine citrate level, which can be raised by potassium admin￾istration (84). However, in most patients who excrete subnormal
amounts of citrate in their urine, no apparent cause can be found,
and the underlying mechanisms are presently unknown.
Clinical management. Idiopathic CaOx SFs with low urine citrate
levels can benefit from potassium citrate salt administration,

which increases urine citrate level and reducesstone recurrence (see
“Treatmenttrials:stone recurrence outcomes”). Suggested dosages
of potassium citrate salts range from 20–60 mEq/d, achieved in 2
or 3 doses. Alkali treatment does not reliably reduce urine calcium
levels(85, 86) in IH. If hypercalciuria is present and does not abate
with alkali, addition of thiazide is prudent to prevent an increase
in CaP SS and development of CaP stones.
Hyperuricosuria
High urine UA excretion in men and women (above 800 mg/d and
750 mg/d, respectively) is associated with the formation of idio￾pathic CaOx stones (12). Dissolved UA salts appear to reduce the
solubility of CaOx (87–89), fostering stones. Although hyperuri￾cosuria results from high dietary intake of beef, poultry, and fish
and can be abolished by dietary changes, no clinical trials docu￾ment the effectiveness of this approach. A single trial has validat￾ed the use of allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, which
reduces UA production, as effective in reducing stone recurrence
(see “Treatment trials: stone recurrence outcomes”).
CaP stones
In a majority of kidney stones, CaOx is the main constituent and
CaP is present in amounts ranging from 1% to 10% (90). When CaP
becomesthe main constituent(>50%) ofstones,the stones are called
CaP stones, and patientswho form CaP stones are referred to as CaP
SFs. CaP is present in urinary stones as either apatite (the principal
constituent of bones and teeth) or brushite (calcium monohydrogen
phosphate). Brushite, but not apatite,stones are physically resistant
to ESWL,so repeated treatments may be needed (91).Brushite stones
are associated with a distinctive renal disease (92). What drives the
development of brushite versus apatite stonesis not known.
CD plugging and brushite stones
In patients whose stones contain brushite (92), plugs of apatite fill
the lumens ofthe terminal CD (Figure 4A). Epithelial cells are dam￾aged or destroyed (Figure 4B). Around affected tubules, the inter￾stitium is inflamed and scarred. Idiopathic CaOx SFs do not have
intratubular crystals, whereas all brushite SFs we have biopsied to
date have exhibited CD plugging. Stone type is therefore a clue to
renal pathology. In the cortex of the 10 patients studied thus far
(92), glomerular obsolescence and interstitial fibrosis exceeds that
in cortical tissue from non-SFs and idiopathic CaOx SFs(Figure 4,
C and D). Serum creatinine level was generally higher and 24-hour
urine creatinine clearance was lower in the brushite SFs than in
healthy controls. In our large clinical series (93), we could not find
reduced renal function in brushite versus CaOx SFs, so these biop￾sied patients may have unusually severe renal disease. Compared
with idiopathic CaOx SFs, and adjusted forsex, numbers ofstones,
and duration of stone disease, brushite SFs require a greater num￾ber of ESWL treatments, and this may contribute to their renal
injury. Although potassium citrate salts are effective as a treatment
for CaOx stones with hypocitraturia, they, along with ESWL, may
promote the formation of CaP stones, whose prevalence has risen
for the past 3 decades. Use of citratesrequires attention in order to
avoid increasing CaP SS excessively via high urine pH.
High urine pH as a main risk factor for CaP stones
Idiopathic CaOx SFs and CaP SFs both are hypercalciuric because
of IH, but CaP SFs produce urine of higher pH, which favors CaP
crystallization (93) by increasing the abundance of urine monohy￾drogen phosphate (pKa ∼6.7), the ion that combines with calcium.
Urine pH rises progressively with increasing CaP percentage in
stones (93). The mechanism of increased urinary pH in CaP SFs is
unknown. Blood bicarbonate levels are normal, and net acid excre￾tion is not low. High ammonia production and excretion could
raise urinary pH (94) but was not obvious in our patients (93).
Management of CaP SFs
CaP SFs are usually treated with fluids and thiazide diuretics to
lower urine calcium excretion. Urine citrate excretion can be reduced,
as in idiopathic CaOx SFs, but because potassium citrate salts can
increase urine pH and CaP SS, careful follow-up is needed. No clini￾cal trials have documented treatment outcomesfor CaP SFs.
Hereditary dRTA
dRTA is a syndrome of metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia with
alkaline urine pH, low urine citrate excretion, hypercalciuria, and
often bone disease (95). Stones are common and usually ascribed
to the combination of hypercalciuria, low urine citrate, and high
urine pH. If given an acid load, patients cannot reduce urine pH
below 5.5, the conventional benchmark (95). Trials have yet to
document stone treatment outcomes.
Autosomal dominant dRTA (Table 3) is caused by mutations
in a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger encoded by SLC4A1 on the
basolateral surface of type A intercalated cells (96). The abnormal
transporter is not targeted to the basolateral cell surface (97) and
may form hetero-oligomers with the normal protein, reducing its
function (98). Although dRTA is mild,stones and nephrocalcinosis
are common and lead to the diagnosis, often in adult life. Auto￾somal recessive dRTA with sensory hearing loss (Table 3) causes
dehydration and growth failure, beginning in infancy or early child￾hood (99). Hypercalciuria and high urine pH cause nephrocalcino￾sis. Autosomal recessive dRTA without hearing loss (Table 3) also
causes growth failure and dehydration;some patients develop late￾onset hearing loss (100). Autosomal recessive dRTA with osteope￾trosis and cerebral calcification, caused by carbonic anhydrase II
deficiency, does not cause nephrocalcinosis or stones (101).
Acquired and “incomplete” dRTA
Acquired forms of dRTA with stone formation are usually asso￾ciated with the autoimmune disease Sjögren syndrome and/or
use of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (102, 103).
“Incomplete” dRTA is used as a diagnostic term when urine citrate
excretion rate is low despite high urinary pH (pH >6.5) and blood
chemistries are normal; given an oral acid load, such patients may
fail to lower urinary pH below 5.5 (104, 105). Treatment of the low
urine citrate is as already described for CaOx and CaP SFs. Stone
treatment outcomes are not known for this condition.
Management of dRTA
Supplemental alkali in the form of potassium citrate saltsisrequired
to correctthe metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia.Dosage for adults
shouldrange between1 and3mEq of alkaliper kilogrambodyweight
(95). No trials documentstone outcomes with alkali treatment.
UA stones
UA stones form because urine pH is abnormally low. Only 90 mg/l
of undissociated UA dissolvesin human urine at 37°C;therefore, at
a pH of 5.35 (the pKa for the dissociation of the N9 proton of UA),
only 180 mg/l of total urate species can be dissolved, whereas the

science in medicine
The Journal of Clinical Investigation      http://www.jci.org      Volume 115      Number 10      October 2005 2605
total urate concentration of healthy individuals and UA SFs approx￾imates 500 mg/l of urine (12). Low urine pH is due in part to low
ammonia excretion (106, 107). Low urinary pH and UA stones are
common in patientswith gout, diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic
syndrome, perhaps as a result of insulin resistance that may reduce
renal ammonia excretion (108). Urinary pH falls with increasing
body weight (109), probably because of insulin resistance. Chronic
diarrhea also lowers urinary pH (69) and causes UA stones.
UA stones are not easily seen on kidney, ureter, or bladder x-rays.
On CT images, they resemble calcium stones, from which they can
be distinguished by their lower density (1). On an i.v. pyelogram
radiograph, UA stones appear as filling defects. UA gravel can
occlude ureters and produce acute anuric renal failure; UA stones
can fill the entire renal collecting system. UA gravel and stones are
often orange orred, having adsorbed uricine, a bilirubin breakdown
pigment. Prevention and even dissolution of UA stones depends
upon the ability to increase urine pH above 6.0, which is accom￾plished by administration of 20–30 mEq potassium alkali, 2 or 3
times daily. Allopurinol is not usually required orindicated but can
be used if alkali does not suffice and urine UA level is increased.
Cystinuria
Genetic abnormalities
Mutations in renal epithelial cell transporters result in reduced
reabsorption and increased urine excretion of the dibasic amino
acids, including cystine. High cystine SS because of overexcretion
causes cystine stones(Table 4). The main apical resorption system
for cystine in the kidney is a heterodimertransporter composed of
a light chain catalytic subunit, b0,+ amino acid transporter(b0,+AT),
and rBAT (related to b0,+AT), a heavy chain subunit (110). rBAT is
responsible for targeting b0,+AT to the brush border membrane,
and it is b0,+AT that acts as the transporting assembly. Although
cystinuria can be subtyped genetically (Table 4), patients of either
type A or B are clinically indistinguishable (111). In all forms of
cystinuria, urine cystine excretion ranges from 350–500 mg/d.
Clinical management of cystinuria
Treatment of cystinuria aimsto reduce SS below 1. Cystine solubil￾ity approximates 1 mM (243 mg/l) and rises with urine pH but is
variable and higherin urine of cystinuric patients as comparedwith
CaOx SFs(112) and therefore is best measured directly (113)rather
than estimated via a pH nomogram. Management(114) beginswith
achieving a daily urine volume of 3.5–5 liters,which can dissolve the
cystine excreted by some patients. Others also require administra￾tion of 40–80 mEq/d of potassium alkali to raise pH. Reduction of
sodium and protein intake reduces urine cystine excretion. Those
measuresfailing, d-penicillamine, α- mercaptopropionylglycine, or
captopril, all of which form soluble heterodimerswith cysteine, can
be used. Blood pressure reduction can limit captopril dosing so the
drug haslittle practical utility. d-Penicillamine and α-mercaptopro￾pionylglycine have side effects including loss of taste, fever, pro￾teinuria, serum sickness–type reactions, and even frank nephrotic
syndrome. Increasing fluid and alkali intake are therefore preferred
therapeutic modalities in as many cases as possible.
Treatment trials: stone recurrence outcomes
To date, 7 of 8 prospective trials, each lasting at least 3 years,
have shown that selective treatments have a distinct benefit for
idiopathic CaOx SFs (Table 5). Table 5 makes clear that dropout
rates were high, and we are not aware that any of the investiga￾tors followed up with those individuals that did not complete
the trial in order to ascertain their stone status. Therefore, addi￾tional trials may not be altogether without merit. Even so, and
despite these imperfections, it is difficult to conclude that treat￾ments are without important benefits.
Thiazide and citrate: recurrent calcium SFs. Three prospective tri￾als of potassium citrate salts have been performed to date, and 2
(115, 116) indicate therapeutic benefit (Table 5). The third (117)
lacks a double-blind design, and its control subjects formed fewer
stones than those in the other studies. All subjects were CaOx SFs
with hypocitraturia. Thiazide diuretic agents have been studied
in 3 randomized, controlled, double-blind trials. Chlorthalidone
(118) at doses of 25 mg/d or 50 mg/d gave equivalent results that
are pooled (Table 5). Hydrochlorothiazide gave therapeutic effects
equivalent to chlorthalidone (119), as did indapamide (120).
Dietary changes for recurrent calcium SFs. Borghi et al. (32) com￾pared a low-calcium diet to a normal calcium diet reduced in pro￾tein and sodium in a 5-year randomized trial (Table 5). The 2 diets
gave comparable results during the first 3 years, but by 5 years, the
normal calcium,reduced sodium, and protein diet proved superior
in that only 23% of patients had formed a new stone.

Allopurinol: recurrent calcium SFs. Allopurinol (121) has been
shown to reduce new CaOx stone formation in patients with
hyperuricosuria (Table 5).
Patients who have formed only 1 calcium stone. Over a 5-year period,
20% of patients who maintained a urine volume above 2.5 l/d
had stone recurrence (122) compared with approximately 50% of
patients who were counseled to avoid dehydration and to observe
moderate salt and protein intakes. Counseled controls did not
actually increase urine volume. We do not combine this trial with
the others, as it concerns only SFs with a single stone.
A final word about stones
It is difficult to accept recurrent stone formation as incidental in
any patient and allow it to continue without efforts to understand
its causes and offersuch treatments asseem appropriate. Available
trials offer physicians excellent treatment strategies for prevention
of calcium stones, and since UA stones are a consequence of low
urine pH, physicians can treat them confidently despite the lack of
prospective trials for additional therapeutics. Even cystine stones
can be prevented, albeit with imperfect remedies. But treatments
may pose their own problems. Although potassium citrate salts are
effective, they, along with ESWL, may promote the formation of
CaP stones,the prevalence ofwhich continuesto risewith time. Pos￾sibly this meansthatthe use of citratesrequiresspecial attention to
avoid increasing CaP SS excessively via high urine pH. Although we
treat urine SS, the tissue processes ofstone formation are complex,
not as yet obviously related to solution chemistry within specific
nephron segments, and not well understood. This is a significant
area of interestthatrequires new research. Abnormal urine pH and
calcium excretion rate are predominant findings in SFs that play a
major role in the pathogenesis of stone formation. Their biologies
are therefore also of particular research importance. Perhaps most
important in the long run will be uncovering the links between
genetic variability and urine calcium excretion and pH, for these
seem at the very center of the problem of kidney stone disease.
