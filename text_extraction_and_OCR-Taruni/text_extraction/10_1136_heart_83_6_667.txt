Abstract
OBJECTIVE To obtain normal M mode (one dimensional)
echocardiographic values in a substantial sample of normal infants
and children.
DESIGN Data were obtained over three years from a single centre in
central Europe.
PATIENTS 2036 healthy infants and children aged one day to 18
years.
METHODS In line with recommendations for standardising
measurements from M mode echocardiograms, and using digital
echocardiographic equipment, measurements were obtained of the
following: right ventricular anterior wall thickness at end diastole,
right ventricular end diastolic dimension, thickness of
interventricular septum at end diastole and end systole, thickness of
posterior wall of the left ventricle at end diastole and end systole,
left ventricular dimension at end diastole and end systole,
pulmonary and aortic valve diameter, and left atrial dimension.
RESULTS Measurements are presented graphically on centile charts
with respect to body surface area, and as tables with mean and 2 SD
values for newborns in relation to body weight, and for infants and
children in relation to body surface area. Best fitting regression
equations are given for each measured variable, using the 50th
centile values.
CONCLUSION In comparison with previously published normal
values, the presented charts and tables make it possible to judge
echocardiographic measurements of a particular patient as normal
or abnormal.
