Abstract
Background-Transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic stent shunts (TIPSS) are
increasingly being used to manage the
complications of portal hypertension.
This study reports on the follow up on 130
patients who have undergone TIPSS.
Patients and Methods-One hundred and
thirty patients (81 male), mean (SD) age
54.7 (12.5) years underwent TIPSS. The
majority (64.6%) had alcoholic cirrhosis
and 53.2% had Childs C disease. Indi￾cations were: variceal haemorrhage
(76.2%), refractory ascites (13.1%), portal
hypertensive gastropathy (4.6%), others
(6.1%). Shunt function was assessed by
Doppler ultrasonography and two then six
monthly portography and mean follow up
for survivors was 18-0 months (range
2-43.5).
Results-The procedure was successful in
119 (91.5%). Sixty three episodes of shunt
dysfunction were observed in 45 (37.8%)
patients. Variceal rebleeding occurred in
16 (13.40/o) patients and was always asso￾ciated with shunt dysfunction. Twenty
(16.8%) patients had new or worse spon￾taneous encephalopathy after TIPSS and
11 (64.7%) patients had an improvement
in resistant ascites. Thirty day mortality
was 21.8% and one year survival 62.5%.
Conclusion-TIPSS is an effective treat￾ment for variceal bleeding, resistant
ascites, and portal hypertensive gastro￾pathy. Rebleeding is invariably associated
with shunt dysfunction, the frequency of
which increases with time, therefore
regular and longterm shunt surveillance is
required.

Keywords: transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
stent shunt, portal hypertension, varices, ascites.
Since their introduction into clinical practice in
1989,' transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
stent shunts (TIPSS) are being increasingly
used in the management of both variceal
haemorrhage and refractory ascites.
Variceal haemorrhage is the most dramatic
complication of portal hypertension, occurring
in 30% patients with cirrhosis during their
lifetime.2 Mortality from the first bleed
approaches 50%3 and 70-100% patients have
recurrent bleeding. Immediate control of
bleeding can be achieved in 90% of patients by
balloon tamponade,4 vasoactive drug therapy,5
sclerotherapy,6 variceal band ligation7 or
surgery,8 9 with the greatest reduction in re￾bleeding rates achieved by surgical shunts.'0
The main limitations of shunt surgery are its
high perioperative mortality and frequency of
debilitating postoperative encephalopathy,
which approaches 30% in some series." TIPSS
has been shown to control active variceal
haemorrhage and reduce rebleeding rates while
having lower procedure related complications
and probably less post-treatment encephalo￾pathy'2 compared with surgical shunts. Follow
up of patients with TIPSS is however limited,
which is important as encephalopathy follow￾ing surgical shunts commonly was delayed and
shunt patency after TIPSS may decrease with
time.
Refractory ascites is associated with ad￾vanced liver disease and a poor prognosis.'3
The current therapeutic options of repeated
paracentesis and a peritoneovenous shunt are
far from ideal and associated with significant
morbidity and prolonged hospital stay and do
not affect survival.'4 TIPSS permits better
control of ascites and improves renal sodium
excretion'5 although the mortality seems
unchanged in the limited reported data. TIPSS
has also been used and found to be effective in
the control of other conditions such as portal
hypertensive gastropathy, splenomegaly,'6
Budd-Chiari syndrome,'7 and hepatic hydro￾thorax.'8 The present available literature is
limited both by short duration of follow up and
small patient numbers. Up until August 1995,
we had carried out 130 TIPSS procedures in
our unit and the aim of this paper is to present
our results and more importantly the longterm
follow up.
Methods
PATIENTS
From 1991 to 1995, TIPSS insertion was
attempted in 130 patients, with successful
placement of the stent in 119 cases (91.5%).
Table I shows the details of the patients. Eighty
one patients were male with mean (SD) age of
54.7 (12.5) years (range 9 to 83 years). Over
the same period, a total of 220 patients were
treated for variceal haemorrhage at our
institution.

The aetiology of portal hypertension was
alcoholic cirrhosis (ALD) in 84 (64.6%)
patients, with other aetiologies shown in
Table I. One patient had al antitrypsin
deficiency and one Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Four patients were non-cirrhotic (one each
with amyloid, idiopathic portal hypertension,
polycystic disease, and nodular regenerative
hyperplasia). Most cirrhotic patients (53.2%)
had Childs-Pugh grade
C disease at time of
TIPSS with
a mean (SD) overall Childs-Pugh
score of 9
9 (2.7).
The indication for TIPSS was oesophageal
variceal bleeding in 73 (56-2%) patients who
had either continued bleeding despite two
sessions of sclerotherapy or were part of
a trial
comparing band ligation with TIPSS in the
prevention of rebleeding (see Table I). The
indication was ectopic varices in five (3.8%)
patients (two rectal, two stomal, and one duo￾denal) and painful splenomegaly, hypersplen￾ism and embolisation of a spontaneous shunt in
one patient each. Thirty five procedures
(26.9%) were carried out as an emergency with
19 (14-6%) patients receiving assisted ventila￾tion and 23 (17.7%) patients treated with
balloon tamponade prior to TIPSS.
STUDY DESIGN
The technique of TIPSS placement was based
on the original method described by Richter`9
and is described in detail elsewhere.20 Routine
pre-procedural mesenteric angiography was
undertaken in the first 32 patients to guide
portal vein puncture and in 27 subsequent
patients, Doppler ultrasonography was used to
identify the site of portal vein bifurcation. In
the last 71 patients however, no routine
imaging was undertaken to localise the portal
vein pre-TIPSS, although ultrasonography was
used prior to the procedure to exclude portal
vein thrombosis. These changes have evolved
as
a result of ongoing audit at our unit.
Once successful puncture of the portal vein
was achieved, 2-3 Palmaz stents (Johnson and
Johnson) (20 patients), or 1-2 Wallstents
(Schneider US Stent Division) (99 patients)
were inserted to reduce the portal pressure
gradient (defined as: (portal pressure)
-
(inferior vena-caval pressure)) to less than 12
mm Hg. Three patients subsequently had
Angiomed stents (Angiomed, Karlsruhe,
Germany) inserted to reduce the shunt size. In
two patients in whom
a thrombus was noted
within the portal vein at the end of the
procedure,
a catheter was left within the shunt
for regional infusion of low dose streptokinase
for 24 hours. Prophylactic antibiotics (cefo￾taxime and amoxycillin) were given one hour
before the procedure and continued for 48
hours thereafter and Doppler ultrasonography
was performed prior to discharge to ensure
shunt patency. Routine portography was
undertaken at one to three months and six
monthly thereafter to assess shunt function, or
earlier in the event of rebleeding or reaccumu￾lation of ascites. Early in our experience how￾ever, several shunts were left six to 12 months
before initial angiographic assessment.
Encephalopathy was assessed clinically after
six weeks then at three monthly intervals
during outpatient review. Prophylactic lactu￾lose and protein restriction were not routinely
applied. Variceal rebleeding was defined as
endoscopically confirmed variceal haemor￾rhage occurring more than 24 hours after
TIPSS insertion. All shunt complications were
confirmed angiographically with occlusion
defined as absent flow through the shunt.
Pseudo-intimal hyperplasia, hepatic vein
stenosis, portal vein and shunt thrombosis
were defined by the angiographic appearance
in conjunction with either
a 20% rise in portal
pressure gradient or an increase in portal
pressure gradient to 12 mm Hg or more.
Primary shunt patency was defined as the (pre￾intervention) absence of any of the above shunt
complications. Mean (SD) follow up (defined
as time to death, most recent clinical review or
liver transplantation) for all patients was 107
(11.0) months and for survivors (patients alive
up to October 1995) 18-0 (1 19) months.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

SHUNT PROCEDURE
TIPSS placement was successful in 119
(91.5%) patients. The procedure failed in 11
patients (10 of whom had variceal haemor￾rhage) because a main branch of the portal vein
could not be punctured: four of these patients
subsequently underwent shunt surgery and five

mortality in the failed TIPSS group with
variceal haemorrhage was 70.0%.
Two procedure related deaths occurred from
intraperitoneal haemorrhage because of an
extrahepatic tear of the portal vein in one and
puncture of the liver capsule in the other. One
patient developed an epidural haemorrhage,
which was diagnosed after the procedure but
the exact relation to TIPSS placement was
unclear. Other complications included portal
vein thrombosis in two patients (successfully
treated by local streptokinase infusion), portal
vein dissection in one (successfully managed by
stenting), and shunt dislocation or migration
into the splenic vein in two. There were no

was reduced from 17.5 (5.9) mm Hg pre￾TIPSS to 8.6 (3.4) mm Hg (p<0001) after
successful stent placement.
A total of 63 episodes of shunt complications
were seen in 45 patients (see table II). Twenty
nine of these were clinically significant (asso￾ciated with variceal rebleeding or reaccumu￾lation of ascites), with the others detected on
routine surveillance. Fifty per cent of the shunt
complications occurring less than one month
after TIPSS were associated with variceal re￾bleeding, as were 41.7% of those occurring
from one to three months, 35% from three to
12 months, and 23.5% from 12-24 months.
None of the shunt complications occurring
more than two years after TIPSS were asso￾ciated with variceal rebleeding. Taking follow
up as most recent angiographic TIPSS assess￾ment, pre-intervention shunt patency was
71-2% at six months, 58/1% at one year, and
21-4% at two years (see Table II and Fig 1).
No Palmaz stent had primary patency at two
years. All shunt complications but one (in a
patient who was transferred to an endoscopic
banding programme and remains well) were
successfully treated by balloon dilatation, local
thrombolysis, shunt extension or parallel shunt
placement (nine patients). The causes of shunt
dysfunction are described in Table II.
CLINICAL FOLLOW UP
Control of acute bleeding
Thirty five patients had TIPSS for acute
variceal haemorrhage uncontrolled despite
sclerotherapy with or without tamponade.
Eighteen of these patients were mechanically
ventilated and 10 were haemodynamically
unstable at time of TIPSS. The procedure was
technically successful in 32 of these patients and
the other three patients died: two from massive
haemorrhage and one shortly after oesophageal
transection. Fourteen of the remaining patients
died during the index hospital admission: three
each from acute on chronic liver failure, sepsis,
and end stage liver failure, two from continued
bleeding (one from a sclerotherapy ulcer
confirmed at necropsy and one with
disseminated intravascular coagulation and
acidosis), two from cardiac arrests/myocardial
infarct, and one from a procedure related
intraperitoneal bleed. Two further patients had
subsequent variceal rebleeds, both related to
shunt insufficiency and successfully treated by
angioplasty and shunt extension.
Recurrent variceal bleeding
TIPSS was successful in reducing recurrent
variceal haemorrhage. There were 24 episodes
of variceal re-bleeding in 16 (13.4%) patients
(see Fig 1), all of which were associated with
shunt insufficiency and responded to dilatation
or further stenting. Five patients underwent
TIPSS for ectopic variceal haemorrhage (two
rectal, two stomal, and one duodenal) and
none of these patients have had a recurrent
bleed. Non-variceal haemorrhage occurred in
nine (7.6%) patients (see Table III).

Ascites
Eighty six patients (66&2%) had ascites prior to
TIPSS and this was the primary indication in
17 patients (seven of whom had established
hepatorenal syndrome) (see Table III). The
ascites improved (reduced or no diuretic
requirement) in 56 (65. 1O%) of the 86 patients,
but reaccumulated in 14. This was associated
with shunt insufficiency in 11 patients and
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in two, but
was responsive in all cases to shunt revision and
antibiotics respectively. Of the 17 patients who
had TIPSS performed for refractory ascites,
improvement occurred in 11 and two have
subsequently undergone successful liver trans￾plantation. Those with biochemical evidence
of renal dysfunction tended to respond less well
after TIPSS insertion.
Other indications
TIPSS was performed for intractable bleeding
from portal hypertensive gastropathy in six
patients. Four of these have not required
further transfusion and the other two have
required one admission each for transfusion.
Both of these patients had evidence of shunt
dysfunction due to pseudo-intimal hyperplasia
in association with
a raised portal pressure
gradient, which was successfully treated by
angioplasty or shunt extension. TIPSS resulted
in an improvement in platelet count from
13 000/1 to 50 000/1 in one patient with hyper￾splenism. Another patient had a large
spontaneous shunt successfully embolised via
the TIPSS for amelioration of intractable
hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatic encephalopathy
Forty four (33.8%) patients were clinically
encephalopathic prior to TIPSS and this
resolved in 24 (54.5%) after the procedure.
Twenty (16.8%) patients developed new or
worsening spontaneous encephalopathy during
follow up (15 within the first six months).
A
further 15 (12.6%) patients developed en￾cephalopathy secondary to sepsis or bleeding
during follow up (see Table III). Reduction in
shunt size was performed because of en￾cephalopathy in four patients (successful in
three), with all others responding to simple
medical treatment.

respectively.)
Sepsis
Fourteen (11 .8%) patients developed clinically
significant infections in the week after TIPSS
(seven pulmonary, two spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, two related to central venous
catheter, one cellulitis, and two of unknown
origin). Sepsis was the cause of death in two
patients during the index admission: one with
pre-existing staphylococcal and fungal septi￾caemia and one with cystic fibrosis and pre￾existing lung sepsis. All other infective episodes
responded to antibiotics.
Liverfunction
Approximately one third of patients exhibited a transient deterioration in their liver function
tests in the first week after TIPSS, usually with
doubling of bilirubin and alanine amino￾transferase values. Three patients died with
clinical features of acute liver failure, character￾ised by hypotension, renal failure, and hypo￾glycaemia. Two of these patients also had
evidence of raised intracranial pressure on
extradural pressure recordings or computed
tomography. Childs-Pugh score did however
improve at three to six months to 7-6 (2. 1)
(p=0.019) largely because of
a reduction in
ascites.
Transplantation
Thirteen patients have undergone orthotopic
liver transplantation after TIPSS. Transplant
was undertaken
a mean of 7.1 (5.4) months
after TIPSS and 11 of these patients remain
alive and well.
Mortality
Of the 119 patients with successful TIPSS
placement, 52 have died and 13 have under￾gone transplantation. Procedure related
mortality was 1.5% and mean time to death
was 6-0 (8.9) months (range 0.03-45.3). Mean
follow up of survivors is 18.0 (11.9) months
(range
2 0-43.5). Thirty day mortality was
21.8% (84/6% of whom had Childs
C disease)
and six months survival 69.2%. One and two
year survival is 62.3% and 46.5% respectively.
Mortality was dependent on Childs grade at
time of TIPSS (see Fig 2).
Discussion
This is only the second study with large
numbers of patients and longterm follow up
and our results are similar to the two year
follow up of 90 patients reported by Laberge
et al.2' Shunt insertion was achieved with
a
reduction in the portal pressure gradient to
below 12 mm Hg in 91.5% patients. Our
recurrent variceal rebleeding rate (13.4%
patients) and rate of new or worsening
spontaneous encephalopathy (16.8% patients)
compares favourably with most other
series.12 21-23
TIPSS has established
a position as
a 'rescue
procedure' for uncontrolled variceal bleeding.

TIPSSfor the treatment ofportal hypertension
continued variceal haemorrhage despite sclero￾therapy with or without balloon tamponade,
shunt creation was successful in the vast
majority (914%). Most (77.1%) of these
patients had Childs C cirrhosis. Although only
two patients had continued bleeding the
inpatient mortality in this high risk group was
43.7%. The options of a surgical portosystemic
shunt or transection in this situation have
higher procedure related and early mortality.24
In addition transection has higher rebleeding
rates2' and surgical shunting has higher rates of
encephalopathy26 while also compromising a
subsequent liver transplant. It should be noted
that in many cases TIPSS is performed in
critically ill patients who would not be con￾sidered fit for surgery.
Similar to other investigators,21 we found
shunt dysfunction in all patients with variceal
rebleeding. There seems to be a steady attrition
rate in shunt patency with time (Table II and
Fig 1) with a primary (pre-intervention)
patency of 21.4% at two years. We have pre￾viously shown that shunt dysfunction is more
common with Palmaz stents than Wallstents,27
although it should be noted that our early (often
Palmaz stented) patients were left longer than
three months prior to initial angiographic
assessment, therefore especially in this group it
is difficult to be sure of the exact timing of shunt
dysfunction. Accepting this limitation, if it is
believed important to assess the TIPSS prior to
a 20% risk of dysfunction, it is necessary to
check the shunt at two months and then
approximately six monthly thereafter. It would
seem that early shunt dysfunction is more likely
to be associated with variceal rebleeding than
that occurring later after TIPSS, therefore even
closer shunt assessment in the first few months
after placement may be neccessary.
Although intervention maintained shunt
patency in all but one patient when insuf￾ficiency was detected, most stents treated with
balloon dilatation required repeat dilatation on
follow up. This procedure would seem to have
only a temporary effect and the longterm
benefits of and exact indications for dilatation
remain unclear. The current limitations of
ultrasonographic methods of shunt assess￾ment28 mean that direct portography remains
the 'gold standard' for surveillance. This is an
important limitation of TIPSS but hopefully
the development of new covered stents will
tackle this problem.
An ability to identify early shunt dysfunction
and minimise encephalopathy together with a
low incidence of rebleeding makes TIPSS an
alternative to sclerotherapy in the treatment of
recurrent variceal bleeding. Trials are currently
underway to compare these two treatments in
this situation. In the case of gastric variceal
haemorrhage where current endoscopic treat￾ments are unsatisfactory, we believe TIPSS to
be the treatment of choice, as indicated by the
comparatively large proportion of patients in
our series with gastric varices.
Nine (7.6%) patients developed non￾variceal bleeding during follow up, mostly as a
result of sclerotherapy ulcers and these were
the cause of death in two patients. Sclero￾therapy ulcers have been recognised as a major
problem by many investigators and remain a
major potential cause of morbidity and
mortality no matter how effective the shunt is.
The alternative of band ligation should reduce
the frequency of this complication.29
New or worsening spontaneous encephalo￾pathy was seen in 16S8% patients and a further
12.6% had new or worsening encephalopathy
secondary to sepsis or bleeding after TIPSS.
Considering however that 33.6% patients were
encephalopathic prior to TIPSS, it is difficult
to determine the exact role of the shunt in the
development of encephalopathy in this group.
In all but four patients (who went on to shunt
reduction), the encephalopathy responded to
simple medical treatment such as lactulose and
protein restriction. This contrasts with the
often debilitating encephalopathy seen in
around one third of patients after non-selective
surgical shunts"1 and is probably because of the
small stent diameter and intrahepatic position
that encourages continued portal flow into the
liver.30 A reduced incidence of encephalopathy
has been reported in narrow portocaval
H-grafts3' and selective splenorenal shunts32
however the associated risks of surgery and
subsequent problems with transplantation must
again be considered. Recent reports indicate
that increasing age and a previous history of
encephalopathy are the main predictors of en￾cephalopathy after TIPSS33 and perhaps these
patients should have narrower stents placed.
Treatment of patients with refractory ascites
remains a major clinical problem. Apart from
liver transplantation, the main therapeutic
options are repeated large volume paracentesis
and peritoneovenous shunting, both of which
are associated with significant morbidity and
prolonged inpatient management and may
aggravate functional renal failure. Recent
reports'4 15 describe the benefits of TIPSS for
refractory ascites although data are limited. The
mechanism of action seems to be a combina￾tion of reduced portal pressure gradient and
increased natriuresis, probably secondary to
increased effective circulating plasma volume
and neurohumeral factors. Survival is poor in
patients with refractory ascites and any trial
assessing TIPSS in this situation would need to
assess quality of life and cost-benefit factors.
The place of TIPSS in the treatment of
hepatorenal syndrome also remains contro￾versial. Several authors have reported improve￾ment in functional renal failure'5 34 and a
preliminary study35 showed a decrease after
TIPSS in the levels of endothelin 1, which is
thought to have an important role in the
syndrome. However as we found in this study,
results are generally disappointing in this group
of patients and they have a very poor prognosis
without liver transplantation.
Similar to other investigators,36 we found a
transient deterioration in liver function tests in
a third of patients probably secondary to
reduced hepatic perfusion. Three patients died
soon after TIPSS with clinical features of acute
liver failure, two of whom had evidence of
raised intracranial pressure. This is unusual in
patients with chronic liver disease but has been

reported.37 All three of these patients were
extremely ill at the time of TIPSS, however,
with prolonged hypotension and requiring
ventilation. The role of TIPSS in their clinical
deterioration is therefore difficult to define,
although any reduction in liver perfusion in
such patients may be critical. Overall however
there was
a significant improvement in Childs￾Pugh score at three to six months largely due
to improvement in ascites.
Procedure related mortality was 1.5%,
which is similar to most reported series and
compares favourably with the operative mor￾tality associated with surgical portosystemic
shunts of around 10%.38 We found
a relatively
high 30 day mortality of 21 8% compared with
some groups,22 however mortality has been
consistently shown to depend on Childs grade
at time of TIPSS and our higher percentage of
Childs
B and
C patients (38.9% and 53-2%
respectively) and higher numbers of emergency
procedures (26.9%) would account for this.
Our one and two year survival of 62-3% and
46.5% respectively are similar to the recently
reported series from San Francisco.2'
Longterm survival after TIPSS will depend
on the underlying severity of liver disease and
improved survival due to reduced rebleeding
will be difficult to detect. However the benefits
of reduced morbidity, as
a result of improved
control of ascites and less variceal rebleeding
should not be underestimated. We have
previously shown that besides severity of liver
disease, hyponatraemia and encephalopathy
prior to TIPSS independently determine long￾term survival.39 Thirteen of our patients sub￾sequently underwent liver transplantation and
the benefits of TIPSS as
a 'bridge to trans￾plantation' have been previously reported.40 In
particular the ability to avoid surgery in the
treatment of variceal bleeding before trans￾plant is important.
In conclusion, TIPSS is
a comparatively
simple procedure that can be successfully per￾formed even on critically ill patients. It is
effective in the treatment of both acute and
recurrent variceal haemorrhage (especially
where they are not amenable to sclerotherapy),
refractory ascites, and portal hypertensive
gastropathy. Unlike surgical portosystemic
shunts, it has the advantage of not compro￾mising subsequent liver transplantation. Shunt
dysfunction however is common and seems to
increase linearly with time and variceal re￾bleeding and reaccumulation of ascites usually
occur in the presence of shunt stenosis or
occlusion. Regular surveillance by portography
is therefore necessary and this represents an
important limitation of TIPSS. Post-procedure
encephalopathy is significant but generally
easily treated and bleeding from sclerotherapy
ulcers remains an important cause of morbidity
and mortality. Trials are currently underway to
compare TIPSS with sclerotherapy or banding
in the treatment of first variceal haemorrhage
and with paracentesis for refractory ascites,
which will help define its exact role in these
situations.
