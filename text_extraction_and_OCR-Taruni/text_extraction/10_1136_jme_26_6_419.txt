Introduction
At present, in the UK, live lobe donation of the lung is generally
considered in the context of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) which
is a life-threatening, inherited disease.1 However, if this technique
is successfully developed it may be applicable to other patients with
end stage lung disease. Cystic fibrosis is a disease where the major
morbidity and mortality is due to pulmonary infection and
respiratory failure.2 In l938 70% of patients born with CF died
within one year of birth, but now the average survival has
improved to 32 years.1 The improved survival has been due to
improved medical care, but also, and in very large measure, to the
devotion of the families who have carried out time-consuming daily
treatments such as chest physiotherapy, nebuliser treatment, high
calorie diets etc. To these patients and their families lung
transplantation brought new hope.3 The first successful transplant
for CF was performed in the UK in 1985 and we now have patients
alive and well more than ten years after transplantation. However,
sadly, nearly 50% of patients with CF die on the transplant waiting
list because of a shortage of donor organs from brain stem dead
donors. This is a tragedy for the individual patient, the families and
those who care for them. Is there a way forward?
Can the number of organs available for
transplantation be increased?
Education of the public so that a relative of a brain dead individual
will give permission for the organs to be used has been carried out
for many years but only with a small increase in the number of
available organs. “Required request” where doctors would be
required, by law, to ask relatives of brain dead patients to consider
transplantation and “assume consent” where consent to donation is
assumed unless there is evidence to the contrary, do not have the …
