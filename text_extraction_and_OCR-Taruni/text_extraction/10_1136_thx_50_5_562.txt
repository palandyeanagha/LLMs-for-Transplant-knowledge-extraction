Abstract
BACKGROUND-- The first successful single lung transplantation was


carried out in 1983 for pulmonary fibrosis. Because of the inherent
advantages of single lung transplantation, a transplantation
programme has been started for patients with end stage lung
disease due to emphysema. METHODS-- Between October 1990 and
August 1993 25 patients with severe emphysema (15 men, mean
age 51 years) received a single lung transplant at our institution. All
patients were severely disabled with a mean (SD) 12 minute
walking distance of 281 (165) metres. There were five deaths in the
series, four in the first 20 days and one on day 503. Two patients
suffered graft compression by air trapping in the native lung.
Bronchial narrowing requiring insertion of endobronchial stenting
occurred in four patients. RESULTS-- Mean (SD) FEV1 improved
from a preoperative value of 17.8(13%) predicted to a six month
value of 53.6(13)%, and FEV1/FVC from 23.8(12)% to 68.6(15)%.
After the transplant 12 patients are in New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class I and the rest of the survivors are in NYHA II.
Actuarial survival was 82% at one year and 74% at three years.
CONCLUSIONS-- Single lung transplantation is an effective
treatment for end stage lung disease due to emphysema and carries
an acceptable mortality and morbidity.
