Abstract
Background: Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a highly sophisticated linear accelerator-based treatment
method, and allows dose rate-changing intensity modulation with gantry rotation. We report our clinical
experiences with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using a respiratory-gated VMAT technique for patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when established curative treatments cannot be applied.
Methods: A total of 119 patients (139 lesions) with HCC who were treated with SBRT were registered between
March 2012 and July 2013 at our institution. A dose of 10–15 Gy per fraction was applied over 3–4 consecutive
days, resulting in a total dose of 30–60 Gy.
Results: The median follow-up period was 25.8 months (range, 3.2–36.8 months). The overall 3-year survival rate was 83.
8%. The local control rate at 3 years was 97.0% in all treated lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that the Child-Pugh class
before SBRT had significant effects on overall survival (Child-Pugh A: hazard ratio = 0.463; 95% CI, 0.262–0.817; p = 0.008).
Conclusions: SBRT using a respiratory-gated VMAT technique was an excellent ablative treatment modality for patients
with HCC. SBRT is a good alternative treatment for patients with small HCCs that are unsuitable for surgical resection or
local ablative therapy.

Background
Hepatic resection, liver transplantation, and radiofre￾quency ablation (RFA) are recommended as curative treat￾ment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1].
However, only 10 to 30% of patients are suitable for
hepatic resection for various clinical reasons [2]. In
patients with small HCC and preserved liver function,
RFA provided an excellent local control rate and
favourable survival rate [1, 3, 4]. According to several
randomized trials comparing RFA with hepatic resection
as a first-line therapy for small HCC, survival rates after
RFA were similar to those after hepatic resection, even
though all trials did not reach the same conclusions [5–7].
However, the use of RFA is limited when the tumors are
undetectable by ultrasonography or positioned at the
surface of the liver, at the top of the dome, or near the bile
duct or large vessels.
With recent advances in the radiotherapy techniques,
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been con￾sidered an alternative treatment option for small HCC
that is not suitable for hepatic resection and RFA [8, 9].
Based on phase I/II studies that evaluated the feasibility
and safety of SBRT in primary and metastatic liver tumors
[10–12], several retrospective studies evaluated the local
ablative role of SBRT for small HCC; these studies showed

favorable local control and survival rates [13–16]. More
recently, volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), one
of the most sophisticated linear accelerator-based treatment
modalities, has become available even with gated delivery.
VMAT allows dose rate-changing intensity modulation with
gantry rotation, and may provide more conformal dose dis￾tribution while reducing treatment delivery time and moni￾tor units. In the present study, we report our clinical
experiences with SBRT using a respiratory-gated VMAT
technique as an alternative treatment for small HCC.
Methods
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed a registered database of pa￾tients who received SBRT using a respiratory-gated
VMAT technique for primary or recurrent HCCs between
March 2012 and July 2013. The inclusion criteria for the
present study were the same as those for our previous
study [16]. Patients were selected to receive SBRT for the
following reasons: (1) surgery was contradicted because of
liver cirrhosis, insufficient remnant liver for resection, or
patient refusal to undergo surgery; (2) RFA was not applic￾able because of the location of HCC, undetectable HCC
on ultrasonography, or the bleeding tendency of the pa￾tients; or (3) lesion non-visibility on hepatic angiogram for
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or an incomplete
response after TACE.
Simulation and treatment planning
The simulation and target volume delineation procedures
were the same as those described in our previous study
[16]. All patients were immobilized with a vacuum cush￾ion in the supine position. Free-breathing 4-dimensional
(4D) computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed
using a 16-slice CT system (GE LightSpeed RT 16; GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). To analyse the patients’
breathing patterns, a Real-time Position Management
respiratory gating system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo
Alto, CA, USA) was used, and all CT datasets were sorted
into 10-phase bins that corresponded to the respiratory
phase, using 4D imaging software (Advantage 4D; GE
Healthcare).
The respiratory-gated VMAT technique was delivered
using a 10-MV flattening filter-free beam from a Varian
TrueBeam STx (Varian Medical Systems) with multileaf
collimators (MLCs) comprising 120 leaves of 2.5 mm
width in sliding window mode. Two arc beams, the first
arc beam of clockwise rotation and the second arc beam
of counter-clockwise rotation, were used for the VMAT
plan. The range of arc angle varied from 360° to < 180°
according to the location of the target volume and the
organs at risk (OARs), and the collimator angle was 30°
for the first arc and 330° for the second arc. VMAT
plans were optimized by Eclipse progressive resolution
optimization (version 10.0.28, Varian Medical Systems))
and dose calculations were performed using an Anisotropic
Analytic Algorithm, with a maximum dose rate of 1200
MU/min.
A total dose of 30–60 Gy (median: 45 Gy) was applied
to the isodose line covering the planning target volume
and a dose of 10–20 Gy (median: 15 Gy) per fraction
was applied over 3–4 consecutive days. The total dose
was mainly determined based on general dosing guide￾lines after estimating the dose to be administered to the
normal liver and other critical OARs, according to our
previous study [16].
Before each fraction of SBRT, image guidance for the
fiducial markers that were located around the tumor was
performed in 2 stages using an On-Board Imager (Varian
Medical Systems), as described in our previous study
[16]. At least 1 week before CT simulation, 3 gold seeds
as the fiducial markers were implanted into the liver
parenchyma around the tumor, using sonographic
guidance. In patients who had surgical clips or compact
iodised oil remaining after previous treatments, or who
had HCC in the hepatic dome, gold seeds were not
implanted. Instead, the surgical clips, compact iodised
oil, or hepatic dome was used for image guidance.
Evaluation and statistics
All patients were examined during SBRT, and regular
follow-up examinations were performed at 2–3 month
intervals after treatment. Adverse effects related to SBRT
were graded according to the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0).
Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was defined as
classic (anicteric hepatomegaly and ascites, or elevation of
alkaline phosphatase to more than twice above the upper
limit of normal or baseline level) or non-classic (elevation
in the level of transaminases or bilirubin, which was
graded according to CTCAE, or a decline in liver function
measured by a worsening of Child-Pugh score ≥ 2) in the
absence of disease progression within 3 months after
SBRT [17]. Logistic regression analysis was performed to
evaluate association of variables with RILD.
Radiologic response was evaluated by multiphase dynamic
CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging according to the
modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(mRECIST) criteria [18]. Local failure, intrahepatic recur￾rence, and distant metastasis were defined as the recurrence
of the treated lesion, recurrence within the liver but outside
the treated lesion, and recurrent disease at any site outside
the liver, respectively. Overall and recurrence-free survival
rates were estimated from the date of the start of SBRT to
the date of death or the last follow-up, and to the date of
tumor recurrence or last follow-up, respectively, using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox pro￾portional hazards models were generated to describe the
Jeong et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:416 Page 2 of 8

association of variables with recurrence-free survival and
overall survival. Backward elimination Cox’s regression was
used to select the principal risk factors in the multivariate
model, and variables with p values ≤0.2 in univariate analysis
were chosen for multivariate analysis. Logistic regression
analysis was performed to confirm the variable-effect rela￾tionships. These analyses were two-sided and performed at
the 5% level of significance by using the SPSS software (ver￾sion 21; IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 161 patients with HCC were treated with
SBRT using respiratory-gated VMAT technique during
the study period. Among them, 45 patients were ex￾cluded from our analysis for the following reasons: pres￾ence of major vascular invasion (n = 2), extrahepatic
metastases (n = 6), Child-Pugh class C (n = 1), complete
response after previous TACE (n = 5), prior history of
radiotherapy to the liver (n = 8), loss to follow-up (n = 10),
history of malignancy other than HCC (n = 2), and liver
transplantation before or after SBRT (n = 8). The
remaining 119 patients (139 lesions) met all of the enrol￾ment criteria and were included in this analysis (Table 1).
At the time of SBRT, only 3 patients (2.5%) were
treatment-naïve, and all other patients had previously re￾ceived various therapies, including hepatic resection, RFA,
percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), TACE, or sorafenib
before SBRT. The median number of prior treatment
sessions was 3 (range, 1–25 courses). The normal liver
volume was median 1185.8 cm3 (range, 701.2–2102.2 cm3
).
Radiologic response and recurrences after SBRT
The median follow-up period for all patients was 25.
8 months (range, 3.2–36.8 months). The radiologic
responses at 6 months after completion of SBRT were
available 137 (98.6%) of 139 lesions, and complete re￾sponse, partial response, and stable disease were
achieved in 124 (89.2%), 9 (6.5%), and 4 (2.9%) pa￾tients, respectively. Progressive disease was not ob￾served at the timing of the response evaluation.
Figure 1 shows a representative patient who achieved
complete response at 6 months after SBRT. Local
control rates at 1 and 3 years were 98.5 and 97.0%,

respectively (Fig. 2). Four patients who experienced local
failure also developed intrahepatic recurrence and/or dis￾tant metastasis. Distant metastasis-free survival rates at 1
and 3 years were 94.9 and 77.9%, respectively (Fig. 3).
Intrahepatic recurrence was the major pattern of failure
(72 of 119 patients) and intrahepatic recurrence-free sur￾vival rates (IH-RFS) at 1 and 3 years were 61.5 and 33.3%,
respectively (Fig. 3). In multivariate analysis, the prior
treatment session (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.087; 95% confi￾dence interval (CI), 1.031–1.146; p < 0.001) and age (HR =
1.025; 95% CI, 1.001–1.049; p = 0.039) were significant fac￾tors for IH-RFS (Table 2).
Additional treatment after SBRT for new recurrent lesions
For new recurrent lesions, most patients (73 of 77 pa￾tients who experienced recurrences) received various
additional treatments, including locoregional treatments
for intrahepatic recurrences (e.g., segmentectomy, RFA,
PEI, TACE, SBRT, or conventional radiotherapy) or
treatments for distant metastases (e.g., sorafenib, metas￾tasectomy, SBRT, or palliative radiotherapy).
Overall survival rates
At the time of analysis, 103 patients were alive and 16
patients had died. The 1- and 3-year overall survival rates

were 99.2 and 83.8%, respectively (Fig. 3). In the multivari￾ate analysis, Child-Pugh class before SBRT was the only sig￾nificant prognostic factor for overall survival (Child-Pugh
A: HR = 0.463; 95% CI, 0.262–0.817; p = 0.008) (Table 2).
The 3-year overall survival rates were 85.9 and 62.3% in
patients with Child-Pugh class A and Child-Pugh class B,
respectively (p = 0.003) (Fig. 4).
Treatment-related toxicity
Treatment-related toxicities are summarized in Table 3. All
patients received the planned SBRT without any interrup￾tions, and no patient experienced classic RILD. Elevation in
the level of transaminases or bilirubin of CTCAE grade ≥ 2
that may have been related to SBRT without progression of
intrahepatic HCC were observed in 10 (8.4%) patients. The
worsening of Child-Pugh score ≥ 2 were observed in 7 pa￾tients with the elevation in the level of transaminases or
bilirubin of CTCAE grade 1 (n = 2), grade 2 (n = 4), and
grade 3 (n = 1), respectively. In the logistic regression
analysis, no factor was associated with RILDs which was
defined as the elevation in the level of transaminases or bili￾rubin of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 or worsening of Child-Pugh
score ≥ 2.
The most common acute toxicities other than hepatic
toxicities were grade 1 fatigue (10.1%) and grade 1
nausea (6.7%). During the follow-up period, 9 (7.6%)
patients developed rib fractures between 10 and 30 months
after SBRT for peripheral tumors that were located near
the ribs; however, most of these patients did not require
any specific treatment. Grade 3 biliary strictures that

patients at 12 and 20 months after SBRT for central
lesions, respectively. Other gastrointestinal toxicities such
as bleeding or perforation were not observed.
Discussion
In the present study, 119 patients (139 lesions) with small,
primary, or recurrent HCC were treated with SBRT using
a respiratory-gated VMAT technique. Although more
than half of patients experienced intrahepatic recurrences
outside the treated lesions, the treated lesions themselves
were well controlled and showed an excellent local control
rate of 97% at 3 years. In addition, overall survival rates
were good (83.8% at 3 years).
The local control rate described in the present study
seemed to be similar to that of RFA; this suggested the
possibility of SBRT as an ablative therapy for small HCC,
even though most of the lesions described in the present
study were recurrent cases after various courses of previ￾ous therapies, and therefore might have behaved more
aggressively. In a study of RFA, the local recurrence
rates were reported from 3.2 to 18% at 3 years for early
stage HCC by using the Milan criteria, and less than 3%
for the solitary, smaller HCC (≤2 cm) with liver function
of Child-Pugh class A [4, 19, 20]. There are 3 possible
reasons for the excellent local control rate in the present
study. Firstly, the median size of tumors was as small as
1.7 cm, and most tumors (93.5%) were less than 3 cm.
In our previous study, which analysed 93 patients treated
with SBRT, the local control rate was 92.1% at 3 years
and tumor size was a significant prognostic factor for
local control rates [16]. Tumor burden, including tumor

size and/or volume, was reported as a significant prog￾nostic factor for local control rates in several other stud￾ies of RFA [3, 19, 21] and SBRT [22, 23]. Secondly, our
target volume definition, dose prescription, and treat￾ment delivery methods might be appropriate for the
ablation of small (less than 3 cm) HCCs, even though
the optimal details of SBRT for certain sizes of HCC
have not yet been defined. Finally, respiratory-gated
VMAT can shorten the treatment delivery time
compared with SBRT using static beams. Although the
clinical impact of prolonged treatment delivery time on
the SBRT at a high dose per fraction is not yet clear,
from a biological perspective, a prolonged delivery time
has shown a detrimental effect on tumor control by
reducing cell killing in cell lines or in xenograft models
of tumors with a low alpha/beta ratio [24, 25].
The major pattern of failure was intrahepatic recur￾rence and IH-RFS were as low as 33.3% at 3 years. Intra￾hepatic recurrence was also reported as a major pattern
of failure in many other studies of hepatic resection [5]
or RFA [3, 5, 19–21], as well as SBRT [14, 16, 23, 26].
Intrahepatic recurrence accounted for 78 to 96% of over￾all recurrence that occurred after hepatic resection [27],
and ranged from 45 to 52% at 3 years and more than
70% at 5 years after RFA [3, 19–21]. Intrahepatic recur￾rences are thought to result from multicentric carcino￾genesis, which is an underlying risk of HCC, as well as
intrahepatic metastasis from the primary HCC. Consid￾ering that local treatments cannot prevent the under￾lying risk of HCC development, intrahepatic recurrences
seem to be inevitable. In the present study, the number
of prior treatment sessions was the only significant prog￾nostic factor for IH-RFS and it seems to be associated
with factors. To reduce intrahepatic recurrences, further
studies investigating the combination of regional or
systemic therapies in SBRT are needed, especially when
treating patients with recurrent HCC who have under￾gone multiple prior treatments.
In the present study, the overall survival rate was 83.
8% at 3 years. Although direct comparisons are difficult
because of differences in patient, tumor, and treatment
characteristics, the survival rate of the present study
seems to be higher than that of any other SBRT studies;
there may be several reasons for this. Firstly, most
patients had preserved liver function. In the present
study, Child-Pugh class before SBRT was the only prog￾nostic factor for overall survival When compared with
our previous report, in which the 3-year overall survival
rate was 53.8%, the present study included more patients
with liver function of Child-Pugh class A (90.8% vs. 74.2%)
[16]. Secondly, the excellent local control rate found in the
present study may be associated with improved survival. In
several studies regarding RFA and SBRT, the local complete
response and/or local recurrence were significant
prognostic factors for overall survival [22, 28, 29]. In a study
by Takahashi et al., in which RFA was applied to patients
with early stage HCC and liver function of Child-Pugh class
A, local recurrence was a significant prognostic factor for
survival (5-year overall survival: 84.4% vs. 42.1% (p = 0.
0002) [29]. Thirdly, aggressive treatments for new recurrent
lesions might contribute to improved survival rates. In the
present study, most patients received additional treatments
for new recurrent lesions. Of the 32 patients who received
local ablative therapies for intrahepatic recurrence, only 1
patient died of disease progression.
This study has also limitations because of its retrospect￾ive nature and short follow-up period. To validate the
excellent local control and favourable survival rates of the
present study, further prospective investigation with long￾term follow-up is needed. Recently, our institution has
completed enrolment of patients in a phase II prospective
study to evaluate the efficacy of SBRT for unresectable
HCC (CRIS registration number: KCT00000625); this
study can provide information about the role of SBRT as
an ablative treatment option for HCC.
Conclusions
SBRT using a respiratory-gated VMAT technique was an
excellent ablative treatment modality for patients with
small HCC. SBRT can be a good alternative treatment
for patients with small HCCs that are unsuitable for sur￾gical resection or local ablative therapy.
