Abstract
Aim: To identify the clinical and biochemical risk factors associated
with outcome of paracetamol induced significant hepatotoxicity in
children.
Methods: Retrospective case notes review of those with
paracetamol overdose admitted from 1992 to 2002. Patients were
analysed in two groups: group I recovered after conservative
treatment and group II developed progressive liver dysfunction and
were listed for liver transplantation.
Results: Of 51 patients (6 males, 45 females, aged 0.8–16.1 years),
6 (aged <7 years) received cumulative multiple doses, and 45 a
single large overdose (median 345 mg/kg, range 91–645). The
median (range) interval to hospital at presentation post-ingestion
was 24 hours (4–65) and 44 hours (24–96) respectively in groups I
and II. Patients received standard supportive treatment including N-
acetylcysteine. All children in group I survived. In group II, 6/11
underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and 2/6 survived;
5/11 died awaiting OLT. Cerebral oedema was the main cause of
death. Children who presented late to hospital for treatment and
those with progressive hepatotoxicity with prothrombin time >100
seconds, hypoglycaemia, serum creatinine >200 μmol/l, acidosis
(pH <7.3), and who developed encephalopathy grade III, had a
poor prognosis or died. Although hepatic transaminase levels were
markedly raised in both groups, there was no correlation with
necessity for liver transplantation or death.
Conclusion: Accidental or incidental paracetamol overdose in
children may be associated with toxic liver damage leading to
fulminant liver failure. Delayed presentation and/or delay in
treatment, and hepatic encephalopathy ⩾grade III were significant
risk factors, implying poor prognosis and need for OLT. Prompt
identification of high risk patients, referral to a specialised unit for
management, and consideration for liver transplantation is
essential.
