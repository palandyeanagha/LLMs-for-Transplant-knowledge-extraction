Abstract
Hepatitis C virus reinfection and spontaneous clearance of reinfection were examined in a highly characterised
cohort of 188 people who inject drugs over a five-year period. Nine confirmed reinfections and 17 possible
reinfections were identified (confirmed reinfections were those genetically distinct from the previous infection and
possible reinfections were used to define instances where genetic differences between infections could not be
assessed due to lack of availability of hepatitis C virus sequence data). The incidence of confirmed reinfection was
28.8 per 100 person-years (PY), 95%CI: 15.0-55.4; the combined incidence of confirmed and possible reinfection
was 24.6 per 100 PY (95%CI: 16.8-36.1). The hazard of hepatitis C reinfection was approximately double that of
primary hepatitis C infection; it did not reach statistical significance in confirmed reinfections alone (hazard ratio [HR]:
2.45, 95%CI: 0.87-6.86, p=0.089), but did in confirmed and possible hepatitis C reinfections combined (HR: 1.93,
95%CI: 1.01-3.69, p=0.047) and after adjustment for the number of recent injecting partners and duration of injecting.
In multivariable analysis, shorter duration of injection (HR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.83-0.98; p=0.019) and multiple recent
injecting partners (HR: 3.12; 95%CI: 1.08-9.00, p=0.035) were independent predictors of possible and confirmed
reinfection. Time to spontaneous clearance was shorter in confirmed reinfection (HR: 5.34, 95%CI: 1.67-17.03,
p=0.005) and confirmed and possible reinfection (HR: 3.10, 95%CI: 1.10-8.76, p-value=0.033) than primary infection.
Nonetheless, 50% of confirmed reinfections and 41% of confirmed or possible reinfections did not spontaneously
clear.
Conclusions: Hepatitis C reinfection and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C reinfection were observed at high
rates, suggesting partial acquired natural immunity to hepatitis C virus. Public health campaigns about the risks of
hepatitis C reinfection are required.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects an estimated 170 million
people worldwide and is a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality [1,2]. In developed countries, HCV predominantly
infects people who inject drugs (PWID) [3,4]. Spontaneous
clearance of HCV occurs in 20-40% of primary infections [5].
However, HCV reinfection following spontaneous clearance of
primary HCV infection raises concerns that natural immunity
may be short-lived and/or have limited breadth, with
implications for vaccine development [6] and public health
programs.
Results from HCV reinfection studies in PWID have been
contradictory [7,8], with some studies reporting very high rates
of reinfection [9-14], and others reporting much lower rates
[15-18]. In part these variations may be attributed to
methodological limitations, including variations in test interval
(where studies with lengthy test intervals do not observe short
spontaneously clearing reinfections) [19], and classification of
viral recurrence as reinfections without confirmation that the
viraemic periods were genetically distinct [20]. None of these
studies have been able to analyse predictors of reinfection,
either because of insufficient numbers of reinfection events or
lack of behavioural data. The aim of this study was to examine
HCV reinfection and spontaneous clearance of reinfection
among a well-characterized cohort of PWID in Melbourne,
Australia (Networks II).
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Participation was voluntary, written informed consent was
obtained, and participants were offered pre- and post-test
counseling. Ethical approval was obtained from the Victorian
Department of Health Human Research Ethics Committee
(project 02/05).
Study design
Between 2005 and 2006, PWID who had injected in the
previous six months were recruited from major street drug
markets located across metropolitan Melbourne using modified
snowball sampling [9]. All participants were bled and
interviewed once using a structured questionnaire and selected
participants were asked to participate in follow-up if they met
one of the following criteria indicating risk of HCV infection:
• aged ≤25 years;
• duration of injecting less than four years;
• tested negative for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV); or
• tested HCV RNA negative.
Participants who were not selected for follow-up were
recruited as injecting partners of the primary participants as
part of a larger social network study, and were not included in
this analysis. Follow-up (including blood sampling and
structured interviews) was undertaken from 2005-2010 at
locations convenient for participants.
Laboratory testing
Blood samples were screened for anti-HCV by a third￾generation enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories,
Chicago, Ill); anti-HCV positive specimens were retested by
Murex anti-HCV version 4.0 (Murex Biotech, Kyalami, South
Africa) for confirmation. Irrespective of anti-HCV status,
samples were tested for HCV RNA by the COBAS AMPLICOR
HCV test version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg,
NJ; lower limit of detection - 50 IU/mL) at every visit.
HCV RNA positive blood samples were genotyped by a
reverse-phase hybridization line probe assay (Versant HCV
Genotype Assay, Bayer, Tarrytown, NY) [21]. For molecular
studies, amplification was performed using a nested in-house
PCR with primers specific to the core region [22] and
sequencing was performed on the PCR product using ABI
PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Methods for
detecting other blood-borne viruses have been described
elsewhere [23].
Study definitions
Primary HCV infection. A participant’s first ever HCV
infection was defined as their ‘primary’ HCV infection, with
subsequent infections termed ‘reinfections’. Participants testing
anti-HCV negative, HCV RNA positive at study entry were
classified as having evidence of recent primary HCV infection.
Participants testing anti-HCV negative and HCV RNA negative
at study entry were considered at risk of primary infection.
Those who subsequently became HCV RNA positive were
defined as having a primary HCV infection. If participants were
anti-HCV negative at the first HCV RNA positive test, the date
of primary infection was defined as four weeks prior to the date
of first HCV RNA positive test [24-26]. If participants were anti￾HCV positive at the first HCV RNA positive test, the date of
primary infection was defined as the midpoint between the date
of the first HCV RNA positive test and the most recent HCV
RNA negative test.
Intermittent viraemic events. Participants who entered the
study anti-HCV positive, those with evidence of recent primary
infection at baseline (anti-HCV negative but HCV RNA positive
at study entry), and those with primary infection during the
study were examined for intermittent viraemic events – defined
as one or more HCV RNA negative tests followed by an HCV
RNA positive test after primary HCV infection.
Confirmed HCV reinfection. Intermittent viraemic events
accompanied by the appearance of genetically distinct HCV
(evaluated by analysis of HCV core region – details below)
were defined as confirmed HCV reinfections. The date of
confirmed reinfection was defined as the midpoint between the
first HCV RNA positive test indicating reinfection and the
previous HCV RNA negative test.
HCV intercalation. Intermittent viraemic events that were
not accompanied by the appearance of genetically distinct HCV
(evaluated by analysis of HCV core region – details below)
were classified as HCV intercalations.
Possible HCV reinfection. Possible HCV reinfections were
used to define instances where HCV sequence data was not
available for either the participant’s first or second infection so
HCV Reinfection and Clearance in PWID
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80216

genetic differences between infections could not be assessed.
In these cases, events were classified as possible HCV
reinfections if at least two consecutive HCV RNA negative tests
(at least four weeks apart to confirm clearance) separated tests
with detectable viremia. The date of possible reinfection was
defined as the midpoint between the first HCV RNA positive
test indicating reinfection and the previous HCV RNA negative
test.
Risk periods for confirmed and possible HCV
reinfection. Participants who had spontaneously cleared an
infection during the study period that could be sequenced (and
therefore could be compared to a subsequent infection to
assess whether these were genetically distinct) were
considered at risk of confirmed reinfection. Participants who
had spontaneously cleared an infection that could not be
sequenced, or had evidence of previous spontaneous
clearance at baseline (anti-HCV positive and two consecutive
HCV RNA negative tests at least four weeks apart), were
considered at risk of possible reinfection (Figure 1). Risk
periods began at study entry if the participant was initially
uninfected, otherwise from time of spontaneous clearance. For
participants who became infected during the study period and
then cleared that infection, time at risk resumed from
spontaneous clearance.
Spontaneous clearance. Spontaneous clearance was
defined as two consecutive HCV RNA negative tests with at
least four weeks between successive negative tests (in practice
this interval was always ≥10 weeks). In addition, participants
with one negative HCV RNA test followed by a positive HCV
RNA test that was genetically distinct from the previous
infection were defined as having spontaneous clearance
followed by confirmed HCV reinfection. The date of
spontaneous clearance was defined as the midpoint between
the first HCV RNA negative test after an infection episode and
the previous HCV RNA positive test. Participants with only one
undetectable HCV RNA as their last measurement were
included, but were not considered to have achieved
spontaneous HCV clearance. However, because these
participants may have achieved spontaneous clearance, a
sensitivity analysis was undertaken with these participants
excluded (Table S1).
Viral sequencing and definition of genetically distinct
virus. All HCV RNA positive bleeds underwent viral
sequencing (HCV core region, 331 nucleotides, methods
described above). Viral sequences were compared pairwise,
and the maximum composite likelihood distances were
calculated. The mean distance between viral sequences taken
from different participants but with the same genotype and
subtype was 0.035 (standard deviation, 0.013). When
consecutive sequences from the same participant were
compared, 69.7% of consecutive sequences were identical
(distance=0) and 90% had distance <0.010. Participants were
defined as having a genetically distinct virus if they changed
genotype or subtype or had two consecutive sequences with
maximum composite likelihood sequence distance greater than
0.039 (three standard deviations of the distribution of pairwise
differences from viral sequences from different participants with
the same genotype and subtype). This approach was adapted
from that used by Pham and colleagues [14].
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics of participants with and without at
least one follow-up visit, and of anti-HCV negative and anti￾HCV positive participants, were compared using chi-squared
tests (categorical variables) and Kruskal-Wallis equality-of￾populations rank tests (continuous variables). To assess

diamonds denote anti-HCV negative bleeds and black diamonds denote anti-HCV positive bleeds). When participants are HCV RNA
positive, viral genotype is indicated by colour (green: genotype 1; red: genotype 3; purple: genotype 6) . Change in viral subtype is
indicated by a double asterisk. Periods at risk of infection are illustrated with patterned bars. Patterns indicate the type of infection
for which the participant is at risk (no pattern: primary HCV infection; diagonal lines: confirmed HCV reinfection; dots: possible HCV
reinfection.
Participant 3018 is classified as at risk of primary HCV infection at study entry. Their second bleed is anti-HCV negative, HCV RNA
positive indicating primary HCV infection, which is spontaneously cleared. Since viraemia was detected and sequenced at their
primary infection, from spontaneous clearance they are classified as at risk of confirmed reinfection. In their final bleed, they have
evidence of confirmed reinfection. Participant 3039 has one risk period for possible reinfection, a possible reinfection followed by a
risk period for confirmed reinfection, a confirmed reinfection and another risk period for confirmed reinfection. Participant 4069 has
two risk periods for confirmed reinfection and two confirmed reinfections.

whether time to infection and time to clearance were different in
primary infection compared to reinfection, and to identify
predictors of reinfection separate to primary infection, gap-time
unrestricted proportional hazards regression was used
(appropriate for the analysis of predictors of time-to-event
outcomes where participants can contribute multiple events to
the analysis [27]). Interactions between infection type (primary
infection vs reinfection) and predictors of infection were
assessed. All analyses were undertaken for confirmed
reinfections only and for confirmed and possible reinfections.
Participants were included in the time-to-infection models if
they were at risk of primary infection or reinfection. It was
hypothesised that injecting duration [3], injecting frequency
[9,28,29], recent receptive needle-sharing [30], and injecting
with two or more people in the past three months [31] would be
associated with HCV infection; selection of predictors for the
final adjusted model was based on a priori hypotheses,
strength of association in the unadjusted analyses, and guided
by the rule of thumb that approximately ten events are required
per additional predictor. Decisions regarding whether to model
predictors as continuous or categorical variables are discussed
in Appendix S1. Schoenfeld residuals were used to evaluate
the proportional hazards assumption.
Participants were included in the time-to-clearance models if
they became infected (primary or reinfection) during the study
period. For these models, the date when first at risk was
defined as the date of infection. The primary aim of the
statistical models was to compare time to primary infection and
reinfection and time to spontaneous clearance in primary
infection and reinfection. Insufficient clearance events
prohibited adjustment for confounding factors in the
spontaneous clearance models. In all analyses, p<0.05 was
considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed
using Stata Version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
Results
Participant characteristics
The study included 252 participants, 188 (75%) of whom
returned for at least one follow-up and were included in this
analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in age
(median of 24 in both groups, p=0.053), gender (36% vs. 31%
female, p=0.476), or ethnicity (78% vs. 89% of European
descent, p=0.064) between participants with at least one
follow-up and those without.
Of the 188 participants with at least one follow-up, 70 (37%)
were anti-HCV negative and 118 (63%) were anti-HCV positive
at study entry. Anti-HCV negative participants and anti-HCV
positive participants had similar socio-demographic
characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, housing, and drug most
injected) at study entry (Table S2). However, anti-HCV
negative participants who had been injecting for fewer years
(median: 6 vs. 8 years, p=0.004), were less likely to report
having ever engaged in receptive needle sharing (53% vs.
73%, p=0.006), were less likely to have been incarcerated
(16% vs. 50%, p<0.001), and were less likely to have ever
received drug treatment (64% vs. 95%, p<0.001, Table S2).
Only two participants were HIV-infected, and these had
persistent HCV-coinfection so were ineligible for the analyses
described below. HBV infection was also uncommon; two anti￾HCV negative participants and seven anti-HCV positive
participants were infected with HBV at study entry.
Primary infection
Of the 70 anti-HCV negative participants at study entry,
seven were HCV RNA positive and were therefore classified as
having recent HCV primary infection. Of the remaining 63
participants, 19 subsequently became infected with HCV (148
person-years [PY], incidence rate: 12.8 per 100 PY, 95%CI:
7.7-20.0). Socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics
of participants at risk of acquiring primary HCV infection and
reinfection are presented in Table 1.
Reinfection
Nine reinfections were confirmed in seven individuals (PY:
31, incidence rate: 28.8 per 100 PY, 95%CI: 15.0-55.4, Figures
2 & 3). These included seven reinfections with a different
genotype, one with a different subtype, and one with a virus
from the same genotype and subtype. The hazard of confirmed
HCV reinfection was approximately double that of primary HCV
infection but this did not reach statistical significance (hazard
ratio [HR]: 2.45, 95%CI: 0.87-6.86, p=0.089; Table 2).
Seventeen possible reinfection events occurred in 16
individuals (Figure 3). The overall incidence rate of possible
and confirmed reinfection was 24.6 per 100 PY (PY: 106,
95%CI: 16.8-36.1). The hazard of confirmed and possible HCV
reinfection was approximately double that of primary HCV
infection and the difference was statistically significant (HR:
1.93, 95%CI: 1.01-3.69, p=0.047, Table 2), remaining similar
after adjustment for the number of recent injecting partners and
duration of injecting (adjusted HR: 2.66, 95%CI: 1.26-5.62,
p=0.010, Table 2).
In univariable analyses, younger age and shorter duration of
injection were statistically significant predictors of possible and
confirmed reinfection. For each one year increase in age and
duration of injection, the hazard of infection decreased by
approximately 6% and 9% respectively (Table 3). Multiple
injecting partners in the past three months tended to be
associated with an approximately threefold increase in the
hazard of possible and confirmed reinfection but this did not
reach statistical significance (p=0.066, Table 3). Point
estimates for the HRs of confirmed reinfection were similar for
all three predictors but nine events gave insufficient power to
detect a statistically significant effect (Table 3). In multivariable
analysis, shorter duration of injection (HR: 0.91; 95%CI:
0.83-0.98; p=0.019) and multiple recent injecting partners (HR:
3.12; 95%CI: 1.08-9.00, p=0.035) were independent predictors
of possible and confirmed reinfection (Table 3). There were no
statistically significant differences in predictors of possible and
confirmed reinfection compared to primary infection.
Study retention characteristics were similar for primary
infection, confirmed reinfection and possible reinfection. The
median (IQR) years of follow-up from the time at risk of
infection was four (1-5), three (1-5), and three (2-4), for primary
infection, possible reinfection and confirmed reinfection,
respectively. The median (IQR) number of tests during this time
HCV Reinfection and Clearance in PWID
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80216

was six (4-9), eight (4-12), and seven (5-9), for primary
infection, possible reinfection and confirmed reinfection
respectively; tests were typically four (3-5), three (3,4), and
three (3,4) months apart, respectively (Table S3).
Multiple reinfection
Six participants had multiple possible and/or confirmed
reinfections. Five of these were anti-HCV positive, HCV RNA
negative at study entry so their first episode of intermittent
viremia could not be examined for confirmed reinfection. Three
of these participants had one possible reinfection followed by
one confirmed reinfection, one had one possible reinfection
followed by two confirmed reinfections, and the fifth had two
possible reinfections (viremia from the first possible reinfection
could not be sequenced so the second reinfection could not be
confirmed). The sixth participant was anti-HCV positive, HCV
RNA positive at study entry and subsequently had two
confirmed reinfections (Figure 3).
The incidence of first and second confirmed reinfection,
respectively, was 27.0 per 100 PY (7 cases, 26 PY, 95%CI:
10.9-55.7) and 37.5 per 100 PY (2 cases, 5 PY, 95%CI:
4.5-135.4). The incidence of first, second and third confirmed
and/or possible reinfection, respectively, was 21.9 per 100 PY
(19 cases, 87 PY, 95%CI: 13.2-34.2), 54.1 per 100 PY (6
cases, 11 PY, 95%CI: 19.9-117.8), and 13.0 per 100 PY (1
case, 8 PY, 95%CI: 0.3-72.5).
Intercalation
Eleven participants had HCV intermittent viraemia that was
accompanied by the reappearance of very similar virus
(determined by HCV core sequencing), and were classified as
having HCV intercalation. Two of these were following at least
two HCV RNA negative tests.

Spontaneous Clearance
Of the 26 primary HCV infections, 24 had at least two HCV
RNA tests after the estimated date of infection. Of these, six
(25%) resulted in spontaneous clearance. In comparison, 50%
of confirmed reinfections and 59% of confirmed or possible
reinfections resulted in spontaneous clearance (Table 4). Time
to spontaneous clearance was shorter in confirmed reinfection
(HR: 5.34, 95%CI: 1.67-17.03, p=0.005) and confirmed or
possible reinfection (HR: 3.10, 95%CI: 1.10-8.76, p￾value=0.033) than primary infection. These results were not
sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of infections with only
one undetectable HCV RNA as their last measurement (Table
S1). Study retention characteristics after HCV infection were
similar for primary infection, possible reinfection and confirmed
reinfection (Table S3).
Discussion
We studied the pattern of HCV transmission and clearance in
a highly characterised cohort of 188 PWID with frequent
resampling over a five year period. The hazard of HCV
reinfection was approximately double that of primary infection.
Furthermore, some participants were reinfected more than
once, illustrating the complexity of HCV natural history.
Spontaneous clearance occurred at a higher rate in reinfection
than primary infection; however, unlike in previous studies that
found elevated rates of spontaneous clearance in reinfection
compared to overall clearance of primary infection, in this study
a substantial proportion of reinfections did not clear
(approximately half). Both the elevated rate of spontaneous
clearance in reinfection and the persistence of a considerable
proportion of reinfections have implications for our
understanding of acquired natural immunity to HCV. The
persistence of a large proportion of reinfections also highlights
the need for public health campaigns to educate PWID about
the ongoing risk of infection after spontaneous HCV clearance,
and potentially after successful antiviral treatment. Finally this
study was uniquely positioned to investigate the predictors of
reinfection, finding that shorter duration of injecting and number
of recent injecting partners were independent predictors of
possible or confirmed reinfection.
The hazard of HCV reinfection was approximately double
that of primary infection. Previous HCV reinfection studies have
reported mixed results, some with higher and others with lower
reinfection rates relative to primary infection rates [7-15,20].
Mathematical modelling has suggested that much of this
variation is attributable to differences in study test intervals,
and studies with lengthy test intervals miss spontaneously
clearing reinfections that fall between study visits [19].A study
with one-month test interval reported an average duration of
reinfection of less than two months [12]. Therefore, while our
three-month test interval was shorter than many previous
reinfection studies, the reinfection rate observed in this study
probably underestimates the true reinfection rate in this cohort;
this highlights that reinfection is likely to be extremely common
in this group.

HCV Reinfection and Clearance in PWID
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80216

Reinfection rates may be overestimated by misclassifying
fluctuations in viral load as reinfection [20]. However, this study
found a very high rate of confirmed reinfection using a rigorous
definition that required reinfections to be genetically distinct
from previous infections. A similar rate of HCV reinfection was
found using a less rigorous definition. Further differences
between studies in relative rates of HCV reinfection to primary
infection may be due to differences in genotype distribution
(reinfection with heterologous genotype may occur at a higher
rate than reinfection with homologous genotypes), and
differences in injecting risk behaviours between participants at
risk of primary infection or reinfection. Notably, participants at
risk of reinfection have already been infected with HCV, and
may therefore be more likely to engage in risk behaviours. In
this study, the rate of possible and confirmed reinfection
remained significantly higher than the rate of primary infection
even after adjusting for the number of recent injecting partners;
however, it is possible that this was due to residual
confounding between injecting risk behaviours and infection
type.
Not only was the rate of reinfection very high, but some
participants experienced multiple reinfections in the five year
study period. Two participants had evidence of two confirmed
reinfections, and six had evidence of two or more possible or
confirmed reinfections. Small numbers of participants with
multiple reinfections have been reported previously [12], and in
combination these reports illustrate that the process of HCV
infection, spontaneous clearance and reinfection is very
dynamic, and suggests that either immune memory protecting
PWID from future infection if they continue to expose

themselves to HCV is limited, or cross-reactive immune
responses are insufficient.
While reinfection rates were high, spontaneous clearance
was more common in reinfection than primary infection and
time to spontaneous clearance was approximately four times
faster in reinfection than in primary infection, similar to results
reported by Osburn and colleagues [12]. This elevated rate of
spontaneous clearance in reinfection is heartening in its
implication that partial acquired immunity against future
persistent HCV infection is likely [32]. Nonetheless, by
definition all participants with reinfection previously cleared a
primary HCV infection, so over time persistent infection is
becoming more common in the reinfection group. In addition,
unlike previous studies with elevated rates of spontaneous
clearance in reinfection compared to primary infection, in this
study a considerable proportion of reinfections did not
spontaneously clear (approximately half). This reinforces the
fact that acquired natural immunity to HCV is likely to be partial.
It also highlights the potential health risks associated with HCV
reinfection, raising the importance of public health initiatives to
educate PWID about the risks of HCV reinfection following
spontaneous HCV clearance. Moreover, although HCV
reinfection following successful antiviral treatment has occurred
infrequently in the past [16,33-38], with the advent of new
highly effective treatments [39] and potential increases in the
number of PWID being treated, reinfection following antiviral
treatment may become common and will require close study.
Previous reinfection studies have been limited in their ability
to identify factors associated with reinfection due to small
numbers of reinfection events or lack of data on injecting risk
factors, making this study uniquely positioned to investigate
predictors of reinfection. Consistent with previously identified
predictors of primary HCV infection, shorter duration of
injecting [3] and more than one recent injecting partner [31,40]
were found to be independent predictors of HCV reinfection
after controlling for the infection number (that is, first infection
observed in the study, second infection, etc).
Limitations
It is possible that the number of confirmed HCV reinfections
was underestimated for the following reasons. Genetic
sequencing was limited to the HCV core region, which is
relatively conserved so some changes in viral sequence may
not have been detected. Furthermore, repeat reinfections from
same injecting partner would have been classified as
intercalations rather than reinfections if there was no detectable
change in viral sequence.
Study participants were selected using modified snowball
sampling and may not be representative of all PWID. Further,
while the attrition rate was similar to other community-based
studies of PWID [31,41] and socio-demographic characteristics
were similar amongst those retained and those lost to follow￾up, it is possible that attrition led to selection bias. Nonetheless,
given that few PWID receive medical care for HCV, study
participants may be more representative of PWID than those
attending health services for care [42,43]. In addition, the
participants of this study were recruited from street illicit drug
markets and report high risk behaviour. While it is possible that
they are more risky than the “average” PWID, documenting the
natural history of HCV infection in this high risk group is
important for informing prevention of HCV.
Finally, similar to the other HCV reinfection studies
conducted to date [9-16,18,20], the number of reinfection and
spontaneous clearance events observed was small, limiting the
potential to adjust for confounding factors in the regression
analyses. In particular, this meant that there was very limited
power to analyse predictors of confirmed reinfection separate
to possible reinfection, and it was not possible to conduct a
multivariable analysis of time to spontaneous clearance.
Conclusion
This study found high rates of confirmed and possible
reinfection, including some participants with more than one
reinfection within a five-year follow-up period. Shorter duration
of injecting and having multiple recent injecting partners were
independent predictors of possible or confirmed reinfection.
The rate of spontaneous clearance was high in both confirmed
and possible reinfection relative to primary infection,
suggesting that previous infection with HCV confers some
immunity against future persistent infection. However, many
reinfections did not clear, demonstrating that immunity is
incomplete. These findings highlight the complexity of HCV
natural history in PWID, and that the risk of reinfection should
be communicated to PWID as part of public health programs.
