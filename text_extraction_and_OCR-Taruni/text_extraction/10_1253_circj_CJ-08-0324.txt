ulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect 
(VSD) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries 
(MAPCAs) is an uncommon form of complex con￾genital heart disease.1–3 Until recently, the outcome for 
patients born with pulmonary atresia, VSD, and MAPCAs 
was extremely grim, with surgically treated patients having 
a probability of being alive at age 30 years of only 20%.4
Moreover, there is little evidence that surgical management 
of these patients resulted in any improvement in their long￾term outcomes, with a maximum follow-up of 10 years.5–7
Currently, at our institution children with these lesions 
are treated using a multistaged repair approach.8 The opera￾tion involves preparatory procedures, consisting of aorto￾pulmonary shunting and unifocalization of the MAPCAs 
with native pulmonary artery (PA) branches. When reason￾able pulmonary vascularization has been obtained, the 
patients are treated with complete repair (CR) with trans-

of Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries

Background: There is no consensus on the long-term outcome after unifocalization in patients undergoing 
surgery for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defects (VSD) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries 
(MAPCAs).
Methods and Results: From 1988 to 2006, 40 patients (median age 8.5 months) underwent surgery for pulmo￾nary atresia, VSD, and MAPCAs. The hospital mortality rate for the preparatory procedures was 1.2%; 17 
patients had a complete repair (CR) at a median age of 3 years. Patients with a pulmonary artery index greater 
than 100mm2/m2 had a higher likelihood of CR. The overall survival rate 15 years after first operation in the CR 
group was 87.5%. Cox analysis demonstrated that increased number of MAPCAs (P=0.019, HR=1.666) was a 
significant predictor of poor survival, and CR (P=0.025, HR=0.141) was a significant predictor of favorable 
prognosis. On angiography, serial measurements of MAPCAs showed a significant decrease in size (from 
5.2±2.9 to 4.1±2.9mm after a mean of 20 months) (P<0.0001).
Conclusions: Long-term survival into adulthood can be achieved with an integrated approach. Late survival 
depends on the number of MAPCAs, and CR. Growth potential of unifocalized MAPCAs was not definite.  (Circ J

Pulmonary Atresia, VSD and MAPCAs 517

ventricular closure of the VSD and right ventricular outflow 
tract reconstruction.
The objective of this study was to assess the immediate 
and long-term outcomes of this multistage approach in 40 
pediatric patients with this condition. The main outcomes 
of interest were immediate and long-term mortality, the 
proportion achieving CR, rate of surgical reoperation, 
requirement for postoperative interventional cardiac cathe￾terization, and the functional status of the survivors. We 
sought to determine risk factors for CR and unfavorable 
long-term outcomes. We also sought to evaluate the patency 
and the growth of unifocalized MAPCAs of these patients 
by serial angiography.
Methods
The data of all patients with pulmonary atresia, VSD, 
and MAPCAs who underwent staged repair at our institu￾tion between July 1988 and April 2006 were reviewed. We 
obtained written informed consent from the caregivers and 
next of kin of each patient to use their clinical data.
Patients with ductus-dependent pulmonary circulation 
were excluded from this analysis; 40 patients were offered 
surgical intervention and constitute the core of this study. 
Their clinical characteristics and the parameters of PA cir￾culation before the first operation are given in Tables 1 and 
2, respectively. PA size was reported as the sum of the 
cross-sectional areas of the right and left PAs indexed to 
body surface area, as described by Nakata et al in the patient 
if there were central PAs. The normal Nakata index is 
330±30mm2/m2.
Surgical Techniques
At our institution, the surgical strategy for these patients 
consists of performing unifocalization of the MAPCAs 
through a thoracotomy and a placement of an ipsilateral 
modified B-T shunt, if possible, with the same procedures 
performed on the other side during follow-up.
Unifocalization of MAPCAs
We used an autologous pericardial roll conduit during 
the early period of this study; however, recently we per￾formed direct anastomosis of the MAPCAs to native PAs, 
and we preferably connected the modified B-T shunt from 
the subclavian artery to a native PA.
All collaterals were permanently ligated at their origin, 
from the aorta. Following ligation, all collaterals were tran￾sected and unifocalization was accomplished with tissue￾to-tissue anastomosis. Collaterals could be anastomosed to 
other collaterals or to the native PA.
All anastomoses were accomplished using 7-0 Prolene 
suture (Ethicon, Somerset, NJ, USA). Collaterals were 
anastomosed as follows.
1. Side-to-side anastomosis of the collateral to the 
central PAs, thereby augmenting the hypoplastic PAs.
2. Side-to-side anastomosis of collateral to peripheral 
native PA.
3. End-to-side anastomosis of collateral to collateral or 
collateral to native PA.
An attempt was always made to bring as many collater￾als as possible into as central a location as possible in an 
attempt to reconstruct a PA confluence.
CR
Following reasonable pulmonary vascularization, 
patients are offered CR. The surgical indication for CR 
should be on the basis of pulmonary resistance after com￾plete unifocalization, because the postoperative pressure 
ratio between the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle 
(LV) correlates with the risk of surgical death and the long￾term outcome, and the number of centrally connected pul￾monary arterial segments has been shown to be highly and 
inversely correlated with pulmonary pressure and resis￾tance in the late period following surgical repair.
We decided to perform definitive repair after thorough 
discussion with pediatric cardiologists of the morphology 
of the central PA and development of unifocalized pulmo￾nary arterial beds. Definite repair was tried if the pulmonary 
arterial bed was relatively well developed, at least 10 lung 
segments were supplied from an unstenotic pulmonary arte￾rial branch or unifocalized MAPCA, and major pulmonary 
arterial stenosis was within the range of surgical approach. 
Cardiopulmonary bypass under moderate hypothermia was 
begun, the aorta was cross-clamped and cardioplegic solu￾tion was given. A longitudinal ventriculotomy was made in 
the RV infundibulum and resection of hypertrophic muscle 
bundles was accomplished. The VSD was then closed with 
a patch. The right atrium was opened to close the atrial 
septal defect, leaving a small patent foramen ovale. It was 
elected to leave a patent foramen to function as a “pop-off” 
valve for systemic venous blood in the event of RV dys￾function or elevated right-sided pressures. At this stage, 
rewarming commenced and the aortic cross-clamp was 
released. Pulmonary arterial angioplasty was performed 
with autologous or bovine pericardium if needed. A con￾nection from the RV to the reconstructed neopulmonary 
arterial system was performed. The distal conduit was anas￾tomosed to the reconstructed pulmonary arterial conflu￾ence. The proximal anastomosis was accomplished and, if 
necessary, a proximal extension using expanded polytetra￾fluoroethylene patch (Gore-Tex® Cardiovascular Patch; W. 
L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, AZ, USA), or bovine 
pericardium. The right atrium was then closed. Upon com￾pletion of rewarming, the patient was weaned from cardio￾pulmonary bypass. Transesophageal echocardiography was 
performed in all patients to assess the integrity of the intra￾cardiac repair, and to obtain an echocardiographic assess￾ment of right-sided pressures. If an intraoperative RV/LV 
pressure ratio (pRV/pLV) of more than 1.0 is detected after 
weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiopulmonary 
bypass is re-instituted and fenestration of the VSD patch is 
performed.

Operative and Postoperative Follow-up Data
The 40 patients underwent 104 sternotomies and thora￾cotomies during the study period; these included the prepa￾ratory procedures, CR, and reoperation after CR described 
in Table 3. The median age at the time of the first operation 
was 8.5 months (range 6 days to 16 years). Ten patients had 
only 1 procedure, and the remaining 30 had a mean of 
2.4±1.1 procedures during the follow-up period. The last 
follow-up of each patient’s clinical status was obtained 
from their referring pediatric cardiologists or us by tele￾phone interview. Angiograms were reviewed several times 
to identify the effect of surgical procedures on the growth 
of the PA and MAPCAs. Because of the diversity of the 
operations performed, attention was focused on the results 
of 2 standard procedures: modified Blalock-Taussig shunt 
and MAPCA unifocalization. When a PA or a unifocalized 
MAPCA could be identified on serial angiographic exami￾nation, its caliber and the size of a 1-cm mark displayed on 
the grid film at the time of the angiogram were measured. 
For each patient, care was taken to measure each MAPCA 
at a similar level devoid of focal stenosis. The absolute size 
of each vessel was calculated by dividing the measurement 
of the vessel by the measurement of the 1-cm mark.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, version 
12.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables 
were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test, and 
continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test 
or Mann-Whitney U-test where appropriate. All analysis 
were performed not per procedure but per patient. Risk 
factors favorable for CR were evaluated using stepwise 
binary logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds ratio 
(OR) and 95%confidence interval (CI). Continuous vari￾ables were dichotomized using the median or extreme 
values over the normal range as the cutoff value. A P value 
≤0.05 determined by univariate analysis was chosen as the 
criterion for submitting variables to the model. Goodness￾of-fit was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow χ2
test. The relative risk, defined as the ratio of incidence 
among the exposed to that among non-exposed subjects, 
was used to summarize the strength of the association 
between risk factors and pulmonary complications; the 
95%CI of the relative risk was calculated using Miettinen’s 
test-based approach. Unless otherwise stated, results are 
expressed as mean±standard deviation for continuous vari￾ables, and as a percent for categorical variables.
Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier 
method for the whole patient group and separately for those 
patients who reached CR and those who received “pallia￾tive surgery”. Survival curves were compared by the log￾rank test. A Cox proportional hazards analysis was per￾formed for the same prognostic factors and survival time. 
The measured PA and MAPCAs diameters were compared 
with paired t-tests.
Results
Outcomes
The in-hospital mortality during the preparatory proce￾dures was 1.2% (1/81). The patient died of aspiration pneu￾monia 8 days after right-sided modified Blalock-Taussig 
shunt and MAPCAs unifocalization.
CR was achieved in 17 patients at a median of 16.9 
months (range 9 days to 5 years) after the last preparatory 
procedure. The median age at the time of the repair was 3 
years (range 4 months to 15 years). Each repair consisted 
of transventricular patch closure of the VSD and the place￾ment of a conduit between the ventriculotomy and the main 
PA. The conduit used was a handmade non-valved tubular 
graft (n=13, bovine pericardium 6, bovine pericardium and 
autologous pericardium 4, bovine pericardium with polytet￾rafluoroethylene patch 3), bioprosthetic valved conduit (n=3), 
and homograft (n=1). In addition, 1 patient had a patch 
enlargement of both PAs, 1 patient had a patch enlarge￾ment of the distal main PA, 2 had patch enlargements of 
the branched PA, 2 had intraoperative stent insertions into 
branched PA stenoses, and 1 had an intraoperative balloon 
angioplasty on the branched PA stenosis. One patient was 
left with a fenestrated VSD, which was subsequently closed 
during the same hospital stay (9 days after the operation).
Hospital mortality after CR was 11.8% (2/17). One patient 
died of respiratory failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. He under￾went diaphragm plication because of bilateral diaphragmatic 
palsy but subsequently went into ventilatory weaning failure 
14 months after CR. The other infant died of right heart 
failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and subsequent 
sepsis on the 8th postoperative day. The mean pRV/pLV 
after CR was 0.57±0.13 (range 0.26–0.80).
Favorable Risk Factors for CR
We assessed various variables for their possible associa￾tion with CR: age at the time of first operation, body weight, 
body surface area, arterial oxygen saturation, symptomatic 
status (cyanosis, congestive heart failure), PA index (Nakata 
index: summation of cross-sectional area of each PA divided 
by body surface area, calculated excluding MAPCAs), total 
number of MAPCAs, preparatory procedures, PA morphol￾ogy, the presence of confluent PAs, and the performance of 
MAPCAs unifocalization.
Univariate analysis showed that 3 variables were associ￾ated with CR: Nakata index, total number of MAPCAs, and

unifocalization of MAPCAs (Table 4). However, absence 
of PA was not a risk factor for CR (among 10 patients who 
did not have a central PA, 3 (30%) completed definitive 
repair, whereas among 30 patients who had a central PA, 
14 (46.7%) completed definitive repair (P=0.427)).
Stepwise forward binary logistic regression analysis 
identified a Nakata index of 100mm2/m2 or greater as a 
preoperative variable independently associated with CR 
(OR 7.19; 95%CI 1.09–47.6; P=0.013, Table 5). This result 
was confirmed using stepwise backward binary logistic 
regression analysis. The χ2 value for this model was 7.285 
for 2 degrees of freedom, indicating that the model was an 
acceptable fit for the data set.
Follow-up and Long-Term Survival
Eight patients were lost to follow-up, making the con￾current follow-up rate 80%. The median follow-up time 
was 54.5 months (range 13.4–205.1 months), for a total of 
203.7 patient-years.
The Kaplan-Meier curve for survival since birth of the 
entire group of patients, irrespective of performance of CR, 
is shown in Figure 1A. The estimated probability of reach￾ing age 22 years was 70.9%.
Several variables were assessed for association with poor 
late survival: age at the time of first operation, body weight, 
body surface area, arterial oxygen saturation, symptomatic 
status (cyanosis, congestive heart failure), PA index (Nakata 
index), total number of MAPCAs, preparatory procedures, 
PA morphology, the presence of confluent PAs, the perfor￾mance of MAPCA unifocalization, and CR.
Kaplan-Meier curves of survival after the first operation 
were significantly different for patients who underwent CR 
and those who remained palliated (P=0.022, log-rank test; 
Figure 1B). After 15 years, the overall survival of the 
patients was 70.5%.
Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that the 
total number of MAPCAs, taken as a continuous variable 
(P=0.019; OR 1.67; 95%CI 1.088–2.552), and palliative 
repair (P=0.025; OR 7.09; 95%CI 1.282–39.239) were the 
only significant factors predictive of poor late survival for 
each additional month of age.
Five of the 23 patients who did not undergo CR died at a 
median age of 22 months (range 13 months to 4.7 years). 
The causes of death were shunt obstruction (n=1) and right 
heart failure and sepsis (n=4). The remaining palliated 
patients were still alive after a median of 41.6 months 
(range 2.6–170.8 months). At last follow-up, 2 patients 
were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional 
class I, 6 were in class II, and 1 was in class III.
We observed no late deaths, at a median of 60.8 months 
(range 12 days to 126.4 months) after CR; 80% (12/15) of 
patients were in NYHA functional class I, and 1 was in 
class IV.
Four (27%) patients had redo procedures after CR for 
replacement of the conduit between the RV and the PA. 
The first replacement of the conduit was performed at a 
median of 7.3 years (range 2.1–8.5 years) after CR. The 
freedom from reoperation for conduit replacement is dis￾Table 5.  Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis of Favorable Predictors for CR

months (range 1.0–37.4 months) after CR. The freedom 
from re-intervention is displayed in Figure 2B.
Fate of Unifocalized MAPCA by Angiographic Evaluation
A total of 75 angiograms were reviewed. The effects of 
the shunt could be evaluated in 14 patients, all of whom 
had polytetrafluoroethylene shunts. All promoted growth of 
the central PAs. During the 20-month interval after shunt 
completion, the diameter of the right PA increased from 
6.8±3.5mm to 11.1±4.5mm (P=0.012) and the diameter of 
the left PA increased from 7.4±3.8mm to 10.6±4.4mm 
(P=0.018).

A total of 38 unifocalized MAPCAs could be identified 
on serial angiograms in 17 patients (eg, Figure 3). After a 
mean of 20 months, 6 had total occlusion with thrombosis, 
and 5 presented with stenosis greater than 50%. Six of the 
remaining patients who showed patent unifocalized 
MAPCAs did not exhibit any growth (from 5.3±3.2mm to 
5.2±3.3mm, P=0.382). During this period, the body surface 
area of the patients increased from 0.48±0.18m2 to 0.66±
0.23m2 (P=0.001), while MAPCAs size decreased from 
5.2±2.9mm to 4.1±2.9mm (P=0.015).
Discussion
This study reports our experience with staged repair for 
the treatment of children with pulmonary atresia with VSD 
and MAPCAs. We evaluated the immediate and long-term 
outcomes of this technique by measuring mortality, the 
proportion achieving CR, pRV/pLV after CR, surgical 
reoperation rate, requirement for postoperative interven￾tional catheterization, and the functional status of survivors. 
We assessed a total of 40 patients with this complex lesion. 
We found that the overall in-hospital surgical mortality rate 
was 3.8% (1/81 preparatory procedures, 2/17 CR, 1/6 reop￾eration) and the overall 15-year mortality rate was 29.5% 
(Figure 1A). CR was attained in 17 (42.5%) patients. The 
mean pRV/pLV after CR was 0.57±0.13. The surgical 
reoperation rate was 27% (4/15), and 6 patients (40%) 
required additional catheterization-based intervention after 
CR (Figure 2). Most survivors after CR were in NYHA 
functional class I symptomatically.
Patients who had undergone CR had an acceptable mean 
pRV/pLV postoperatively and significant growth of the 
pulmonary arterial vascular bed at late follow-up. This 
emphasizes the need to optimize the size of the PA during 
surgical repair.
We found strong associations between a smaller number 
of MAPCAs, no need for MAPCA unifocalization, and an 
adequate PA index with CR. Larger number of MAPCAs, 
need for MAPCA unifocalization, and an inadequate PA 
index were all associated with the development of pulmo￾nary vascular obstructive disease in the supplied lung seg￾ments.
Our results set a landmark for the expectations of patients 
with pulmonary atresia, VSD, and MAPCAs-dependent 
lung circulation who are offered a multistage approach with 
the goal of CR. We have observed a remarkable improve￾ment in the survival and quality of life among children 
affected by this condition. Previously, the probability of 
survival to the age of 30 years was estimated to be 20%,4
suggesting that surgical intervention may have adversely 
affected patient outcome. Using our multistage approach, 
the probability of survival to the age of 22 years was 70.9%. 
The surgical strategy for pulmonary atresia with VSD and 
MAPCAs is still controversial. Although sufficient results 
using the staged approach have been reported, 7–9 the ben￾efits of midline primary repair have also been recently 
reported.6,10–12
We found that 42.5% of our patients achieved CR, which 
was slightly lower than the rates achieved in other recent 
reports. Firstly, in our data there seem to be more cases of 
absent central PA than in the other reports; 16 (42%) of 38 
patients. Ishibashi et al reported that the absence of a central 
PA was an important risk factor for completion of definitive 
repair.13 In our analysis, we included the absence of a central 
PA as a variable for completion of definitive repair. Among 
10 patients who did not have a central PA, only 3 (30%) 
completed definitive repair, whereas among 30 patients who 
had a central PA, 14 (46.7%) completed definitive repair. 
Although we could not find a statistical difference between 
the 2 groups (P=0.427), there was a trend that patients 
without a central PA did not complete definitive repair. 
Therefore, if we can analyze a larger number of patients, 
the absence or presence of a central PA would affect the 
completion of definitive repair and would be a meaningful 
risk factor. Second, because this is a retrospective study, so 
follow-up was not complete (80% follow-up rate). Some 
patients who underwent palliative surgery and were waiting 
for CR might be excluded from the CR group. Despite this 
lower rate of CR, no late deaths occurred at a median of 
103.7 months (range 49.2–205.1 months) after CR, and 
most of these patients are in NYHA functional class I.
The need for re-intervention with cardiac catheterization 
or surgical intervention after CR to dilate or occlude vessels 
and to enlarge PAs or change valve conduits continues to 
be a problem. In a recent study, patients who had homo￾graft implants and those with bioprosthetic conduits had a 
freedom from reoperation rate 10 years after CR of 85% 
and 43%, respectively.14 In comparison, we found that the 
freedom from conduit replacement rate at 8 years was 
73.3% and the freedom from catheter-based intervention at 
10 years was 57.3%.
To date, there is no consensus on the long-term fate of 
MAPCAs, although it has been suggested that growth 
cannot be obtained from them.14,15 The latter study, however, 
was based on earlier surgical procedures, and many con￾nections between MAPCAs and native PAs were made by 
interposing prosthetic material. Those results did not 
dampen the enthusiasm of surgeons for integrating MAPCAs 
into the newly reconstructed pulmonary circulation, using 
various approaches, techniques, and timing.16–19 Most of the 
MAPCA unifocalizations used here were performed through 
thoracotomies, which are technically easier than through 
sternotomies, by 2 experienced surgeons (Y. H. Park and B. 
K. Cho). Despite this ideal setting, the results of unifocal￾ization were disappointing. These are technically demand￾ing operations, accounting for the high rate of thrombosis of 
these vessels. Even when the MAPCAs remained patent, 
however, they did not exhibit any growth, which suggests 
that, at the time of unifocalization, collateral vessels may 
have already developed maximally. Thus, their integration 
into the pulmonary circulation would not be associated with 
any long-term benefit to patients for reaching CR because 
they likely do not contribute to the definitive lung circula￾tion in repaired patients. In contrast, we found that shunting 
procedures were extremely efficient in developing even 
diminutive native pulmonary vascularization.
In a previous report,20 major aortopulmonary collateral 
arteries were similar as dilated bronchial arteries. Those 
researchers concluded that MAPCAs are likely to be dilated 
bronchial arteries, which may have limited growth potential 
and their known vasoreactivity might preclude any long￾term beneficial effects of the unifocalization procedure. In 
our serial follow-up angiograms, no growth of MAPCAs 
was found. We think our results support the results of 
Norgaard et al. However, we could not completely exclude 
surgical manipulation of the MAPCAs as the reason for 
growth failure in the unifocalized MAPCAs. It would be 
useful to rule out surgical manipulation, if we could analyze 
the growth pattern of “untouched MAPCAs” on serial angi￾ographic examinations.

In such a long-term retrospective study, there are inher￾ent limitations. Patients in this cohort who presented for 
surgical intervention were older than those presenting now￾adays, with some perhaps representing survivors of a natural 
selection process. It is also possible that MAPCAs unifo￾calized earlier may have better growth potential. Because 
our results showed a consistent lack of MAPCA growth, 
however, it is difficult to believe that an earlier procedure 
would result in potential growth, especially because shunt￾ing procedures performed during the same time frame pre￾disposed to the growth of the native vessels. Angiographic 
identification of MAPCAs is eased by their peculiar mor￾phology, especially unifocalized MAPCAs, with longer 
tracts before reaching the lungs. Therefore, some MAPCAs 
unifocalized very distally at the surface of the lung may have 
better outcomes and could not be identified. Finally, it is 
likely that patients who underwent angiography at an early 
time after repair were those who were symptomatic, thus 
perhaps overestimating PA pressures.
In conclusion, we have shown here that children with 
pulmonary atresia with VSD and MAPCAs can be success￾fully treated using a staged repair and that long-term survival 
into adulthood can be achieved with a multistage approach. 
In our experience, staged repair yields a relatively low mor￾tality rate with good functional results. There remains room 
for improvement in the requirement for surgical reoperation. 
As our experience with this approach has evolved, we have 
observed significant reductions in associated mortality and 
morbidity. We anticipate future improvements in quality of 
life, with reduced need for postoperative surgical and inter￾ventional catheterization in patients treated with this 
approach. In our series, unifocalized MAPCAs exhibited a 
high incidence of occlusion and no growth.
