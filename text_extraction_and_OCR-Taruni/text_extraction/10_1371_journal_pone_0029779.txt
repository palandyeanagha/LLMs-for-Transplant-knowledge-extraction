Abstract
Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that the actions of platelets may unfavorably influence post-transplant
function of organ allografts. In this study, the association between post-transplant graft function and the perioperative
activity of platelet antioxidants was examined among kidney recipients divided into early (EGF), slow (SGF), and delayed
graft function (DGF) groups.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione transferase (GST), glutathione
peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P) were determined and levels of glutathione, oxidized
glutathione, and isoprostane were measured in blood samples collected immediately before and during the first and
fifth minutes of renal allograft reperfusion. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in isoprostane levels in all groups.
Interestingly, in DGF patients, significantly lower levels of perioperative activity of catalase (p,0.02) and GST (p,0.02) were
observed. Moreover, in our study, the activity of platelet antioxidants was associated with intensity of perioperative
oxidative stress. For discriminating SGF/DGF from EGF, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of
platelet antioxidants were 81–91%, 50–58%, 32–37%, and 90–90.5%, respectively.
Conclusions: During renal transplantation, significant changes occur in the activity of platelet antioxidants. These changes
seem to be associated with post-transplant graft function and can be potentially used to differentiate between EGF and
SGF/DGF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the potential protective role of platelets in the
human transplantation setting.

Introduction
Ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) is a very complex phenom￾enon that may strongly determine both early- and long-term
outcomes of transplant recipients. One of the most important
components of the I/R process is the intensified oxidative stress
that accompanies both phases of I/R. According to recent studies,
such temporary systemic oxidative imbalance may trigger a robust
inflammatory response within transplanted organ via activation of
the innate immune system and proinflammatory signaling
pathways; it may also lead to cellular destruction due to activation
of autophagy or enhancement of chaperone stress [1–5].
Platelets are blood elements that are well known as the key
components of coagulation processes. However, platelets contrib￾ute to additional processes that extend beyond hemostasis and
thrombosis. Recent studies revealed that these ‘‘cellular frag￾ments’’ possess sufficient molecular armament that enables them
to significantly influence the function of transplanted allografts [6–
8]. These reports were mainly based on analyses of experimental
animal models, in which researchers demonstrated that platelets
participate in orchestrating inflammatory responses via activation
of the CD40/CD154 signaling pathway. Platelets are also able to
express several proinflammatory and procoagulation molecules
that may finally lead to rejection and destruction of transplanted
organs [9,10]. Several recent studies have highlighted that these
observations may also apply to the human solid organ transplan￾tation setting [10–12]. However, it is also important to stress that
in addition to proinflammatory and procoagulation characteristics,
platelets also possess a wide range of protective substances, such as
antioxidative enzymes, which could potentially exert a protective
influence by limiting the intensity of oxidative stress following I/R
injury of various organs [13,14].
In our previous study [15], we demonstrated that during the
early phase of kidney allograft reperfusion, higher perioperative
activity of prooxidative enzymes, such as xanthine oxidoreductase
or oxidase, occurs and that this is strongly associated with
development of slow/delayed graft function (SGF/DGF) and
poorer 1-year post-transplant allograft function in humans. The
activity of these enzymes results in intensified generation of
reactive oxygen species, mainly superoxide radical (O2-
*
), which

may be neutralized by superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, or
glutathione-related compounds (Figure 1) [13,14,16,17]. However,
although platelets possess all necessary enzymes to significantly
limit the intensity of oxidative stress during the I/R injury that
accompanies renal transplantation, little is known about this
function of platelets in the clinical transplantation setting.
Therefore, in this study, our purpose was to (i) examine the
intensity of oxidative stress and the changes in platelet antioxidants
during the first 5 minutes of kidney allograft reperfusion, and (ii)
correlate our findings with the clinical outcomes in patients. Our
hypothesis was that graft reactivation may be associated with
perioperative changes in the activity of platelet antioxidants.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study protocol was approved by the Bioethical Committee
of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, and patients
provided informed written consent for participation.
Patients
This study included 69 consecutive patients, who underwent
transplantation in our University center (Department of General
and Transplantation Surgery). The patients were divided into 3
groups depending on postoperative graft reactivation: early
(immediate), slow, and delayed graft function (EGF, SGF, and
DGF, respectively) groups, according to previously described
criteria [15,18,19]. Patients were assigned to the appropriate
study group by nephrologists who had no information regarding
the results of molecular parameters. Patients with immediate
activation of the graft, defined by serum creatinine levels below
3 mg/dL on the fifth postoperative day, were included in the
EGF group. Recipients with graft activation problems were
assigned to the SGF (creatinine level higher than 3 mg/dL on the
fifth postoperative day, with no requirement of dialysis
treatment) or DGF group (need for dialysis in the first week
after transplantation). Cross-matching status was determined
using a microcytotoxic test (complement-dependent cytotoxicity;
CDC). Renal allografts were received from patients who died
from craniocerebral trauma (n = 25), subarachnoid hemorrhage
(n = 11), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 19), stroke (n = 5), brain
tumor (n = 4), neuroinfection (n = 2), or suicide (n = 3). Grafts
were stored cold and perfused with EuroCollins preservation
solutions. Allocation of donor kidneys to individual recipients was
centrally directed by the Poltransplant system. All patients were
undergoing transplantation for the first time and received
standard immunosuppressive protocols with triple drug therapy,
including cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and steroids. Oral
cyclosporine administration was initiated on the day of
transplantation at a dose of 5 mg/kg for all patients. On
postoperative day 2, patients had received 10 mg?kg21
?day21 of
cyclosporine. In the case of allograft reactivation problems, this
dose was reduced 50%. During follow-up, cyclosporine doses
were adjusted to achieve troughs of 200–250 ng/mL for the first
3–6 months, with maintenance levels of 120–180 ng/mL
afterwards. The dose of prednisolone was gradually reduced to
5 mg/day over 3–6 months. Acute rejection episodes were
defined using Banff criteria and were proven by biopsy. General
characteristics of the donors and recipients are summarized in
Table 1.
Methods
Blood samples were collected perioperatively according to the
previously described protocol [20]. Briefly, to determine the
dynamics of the platelet antioxidative response, the (0) blood
sample was taken from the iliac vein before anastomosing the
kidney vessels with the recipient’s iliac vessels. Next, once the renal
vein of the graft was cannulated, additional blood samples (1) and
(5) were taken at the first and fifth minutes of reperfusion.
Reperfusion of the transplanted kidney was monitored using the
ThermaCAM SC500 (AGEMA, Infrared System AB, Danderyd,
Sweden) thermovision camera, which detects infrared radiation
and records digital images showing the surface temperature
distribution of tested objects. The process of total reperfusion was
completed when the scans from the thermovision camera
demonstrated that the entire organ was filled with the recipient’s
blood.
Assays of platelet antioxidants
For quantitative assessment of changes in platelet antioxidative
response, 5 mL of blood was collected and mixed with 109 mM
trisodium citrate (9:1; v/v). Blood was centrifuged (10 min; 20uC;
1066 g), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained. PRP was
then transferred to a new tube and re-centrifuged (10 min; 20uC;
38246g). Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was transferred to a new tube
and stored at 280uC until assessment was performed. Platelet
sediments were washed twice in Tyrode buffer (pH 7.4) and then
suspended in it (1 mL). Afterwards, platelets were frozen and
stored according to previously published recommendations
[21,22].
Platelet lysates were obtained by adding Triton X-100 (0.1%) to
defrosted platelet suspensions. Platelet levels of SOD, catalase,
glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione transferase (GST),
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P), and reduced and
oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG, respectively) were
measured using spectrophotometry according to previously
described methods [14,15,23].
Assays of systemic oxidative stress intensity
Plasma isoprostane (8-iPF2a-III) levels were determined by the
ELISA method using the BIOXYTECHH 8-Isoprostane Assay Kit
reagent set (OxisResearchH, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations and previously described protocols [24,25].

leading to hydrogen peroxide synthesis. Afterwards, two possible
pathways of hydrogen peroxide neutralisation exists – either via
catalase activity or via glutathione-related compounds i.e. mainly by
glutathione peroxidase that cooperates with glutathione transferase
and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glutathione, itself, is the
most important ‘‘stabiliser’’ of intracellular oxidative balance. XO –

Clinical parameters of allograft function
To determine allograft function, creatinine levels were mea￾sured during perioperative periods (i.e., on the first, fifth, and tenth
post-transplant day) and during follow-up visits during the first
year after transplantation.
Clinical predictive value of examined parameters
Application of cut-off limits enabled classification of patients
into 4 categories: true positive, true negative, false positive, and
false negative. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive values were calculated.
Statistical analysis
To determine the distribution of variables, Shapiro–Wilk’s test
was used. For comparison of the mean parameter values between
the examined groups, Student’s t-test was used (for normally
distributed variables). Abnormally distributed variables were log
transformed. If normal distribution was achieved, variables were
also compared using Student’s t-test. However, if this transforma￾tion did not change the distribution, the Mann-Whitney test was
performed. Differences between concentrations of analyzed
parameters in consecutive minutes of reperfusion were assessed
by Friedmann’s ANOVA test. To evaluate the effect(s) of
continuous variables on perioperative intensity of oxidative stress,
multivariate regression analyses were performed with a stepwise
selection method. Variables excluded from the initial model were
re-entered individually to exclude residual confounding. During
development of multivariate regression models, the number of
inserted independent variables did not exceed 10% of the total
number of analyzed patients. Constructed models were verified
using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and wrongly
constructed matrices resulted in rejection of the model. Receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for all
analyzed parameters as diagnostics for graft activation problems
(i.e., SGF and DGF), and the area under each ROC curve (AUC)
was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
statistical analysis software. Statistical significance was defined
when p values were less than 0.05.
Results
The mean values of examined parameters and comparisons
between the analyzed groups are presented in Figure 2 and Table S1.
Intensity of systemic perioperative oxidative stress
Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between
examined groups in terms of intensity of oxidative stress
immediately before allograft reperfusion. However, during the
reperfusion period, significant increases in isoprostane levels were

observed in all analyzed groups. At the fifth minute of reperfusion,
isoprostane concentrations were significantly higher in DGF
patients than in EGF patients (Figure 2). No statistically significant
differences were observed between EGF and SGF patients.
Analysis of the antioxidative armament of platelets
Statistical analysis of the mean activity/concentrations of
platelet antioxidants measured immediately before allograft
reperfusion revealed no significant differences between the
examined groups. In our study, we could not demonstrate
statistically significant changes among reperfusion times or
differences among analyzed groups in terms of SOD levels (Table
S1).
Relatively analogical tendencies were observed in terms of
changes in levels/activity of selected platelet glutathione-related
antioxidants. Namely, GSH, GPx, and GSSG activity/levels were
comparable between the examined groups throughout the
analyzed perioperative period and did not significantly change
within reperfusion time, with the exception of GSSG levels that
significantly decreased during the analyzed reperfusion period in
all groups (Table S1).
Moreover, although stable action of G6P was observed
throughout the analyzed reperfusion period in EGF patients, in
patients with allograft activation problems, the mean activity of
this antioxidant significantly decreased during the reperfusion time
(p = 0.003 and p = 0.0002 for SGF and DGF respectively). Our
analysis also demonstrated that although perioperative GST
activity significantly increased in SGF and DGF patients, GST
activity was significantly lower in DGF individuals than in EGF
individuals (p,0.02).
Finally, although no statistically significant changes in catalase
activity were observed during the reperfusion time, mean activity
of this antioxidant was constantly significantly lower in DGF
patients (and also partially in SGF patients) than in EGF patients
(Figure 2).
Perioperative activity/levels of platelet antioxidants and
intensity of systemic oxidative stress
To verify whether an association exists between the perioper￾ative activity/levels of the platelet antioxidative system and
intensity of systemic oxidative stress, we performed a pilot
multivariate analysis with isoprostane levels as dependent variables
(representative models presented in Table 2). These results
demonstrated several strong negative associations between activ￾ity/levels of platelet antioxidative compounds and perioperative
isoprostane concentrations. To our surprise, in multivariate
regression analysis, various clinical parameters, such as donors’
or recipients’ age, (terminal) creatinine level, duration of cold and
warm ischemia time, or hemodialysis treatment before transplan￾tation were not ‘‘directly’’ associated with perioperative oxidative

stress intensity in any group; however, some of these parameters
along with platelet antioxidants influenced ‘‘general’’ post￾transplant allograft function (Table 2).
Clinical value of platelet anti-oxidants to discriminate
SGF/DGF from EGF
In order to establish whether perioperative changes in the
activity/levels of platelet antioxidants may serve as novel markers/
predictors of post-transplant graft function, we constructed ROC
curves and calculated approximate AUC values. Among all
clinical and newly examined parameters, only those with the
highest AUC and 95% CI lower bound value are precisely
described (Table 3). For each parameter, the appropriate
‘‘suggested’’ cut-off value was applied; this offered the highest
clinical sensitivity and specificity.
Discussion
In various studies, it has been reported that intensive
perioperative oxidative stress occurring during kidney transplan￾tation may contribute to development of post-transplant compli￾cations and that this stress may be limited by antioxidant
supplementation during renal I/R injury [26–30]. Recent
preliminary reports suggest that platelets exert profound influences
on the function of transplanted cells/organs and may indepen￾dently contribute to allograft rejection [8–10]. Nevertheless, only a
few studies have addressed the biochemical influence of platelets
on kidney allograft function in the human transplantation setting.
Therefore, in this study, we decided to verify the effects of
perioperative antioxidative responses of platelets on post-trans￾plant renal allograft function in humans.
In our study, we observed several significant differences in
platelet antioxidative activity, which varied according to the
patient’s post-transplant outcome. Namely, we noticed that both
platelet pathways of hydrogen peroxide neutralization (via catalase
or glutathione-related compounds) seem to be less efficient in
patients with post-transplant graft reactivation problems (SGF/
DGF) than in EGF patients. Lower activity of catalase and GST
was observed in the SGF/DGF groups; these groups also showed
significant lowering of G6P action during the reperfusion period.
Several recent papers have demonstrated that excessive free
radical generation promotes vasoconstriction and plays a key role

in the development of renal injury that may be prevented by over￾expression of catalase, which modulates the intrarenal renin￾angiotensin system [31,32]. Our study indirectly supports these
observations, as catalase activity was strongly associated with post￾transplant kidney allograft function and perioperative activity of
catalase was significantly lower in patients having problems with
postoperative allograft reactivation.
Platelet antioxidative enzymes were negatively associated with
perioperative systemic isoprostane levels; concentrations of these
enzymes significantly increased during the reperfusion time in all
groups and were higher in DGF individuals in the fifth minute of
reperfusion. Thus, our experiments highlight that during renal
transplantation, intensified oxidative stress always occurs; howev￾er, this stress is most evidently pronounced in DGF individuals.
Moreover, we hypothesize that during the early phase of kidney
allograft reperfusion, platelet antioxidants probably exert a
protective effect by modulating the perioperative intensity of
oxidative stress that accompanies the reperfusion period following
renal transplantation. This potential protection offered by platelets
seems to be less expressed in SGF/DGF patients and probably
clinically translates to poorer post-transplant allograft function.
However, the results of our study are based on a relatively small
number of patients and may be underpowered. In order to fully
verify the proposed hypothesis and derive definite conclusions,
further studies are required. These studies could benefit from our
analysis, which offers valuable information on the appropriate
sample size necessary for reliable verification of the observed
phenomena. In addition, other plausible clinical factors that could
be responsible for observed tendencies must also be taken into
account, including organ quality, which may increase the risk of
poorer post-transplant allograft function.
The results of our study support previous observations that
clinical parameters such as duration of cold ischemia time (CIT)
and/or pre-transplant hemodialysis treatment may unfavorably
influence early post-transplant allograft function [33]; however, we
also demonstrated that this effect does not seem to be ‘‘directly’’
associated with the modulation of perioperative intensity of
oxidative stress (as no statistical interactions were observed
between these clinical parameters and isoprostane levels). We
speculate that this tendency is observed because prolonged
duration of ischemic time stimulates upregulation of various pro￾and antioxidative enzymes, rather than generating free radicals. In
our recent paper, we have demonstrated that during kidney I/R
injury, upregulation of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity
occurs and is most pronounced in patients with the longest CIT
values [16]. Nevertheless, although we have established a direct
association between XOR activity and intensity of isoprostane
levels (unpublished observation), in the present study, we did not
observe a correlation between CIT and isoprostane concentra￾tions. Therefore, our results suggest that while the influence of
CIT on modulation of postoperative allograft function is inherent,
its effect on perioperative changes in oxidative stress intensity
seems to be indirect and probably modulated by the recipient’s
antioxidative potential.
Finally, the clinical value of platelet antioxidant activity/levels
as diagnostic markers for SGF/DGF prediction must be
emphasized. In our study, we have demonstrated that several
platelet antioxidants may help differentiate between EGF and
SGF/DGF. Among these parameters, catalase and G6P activity
seems to be of the greatest diagnostic value for SGF/DGF
prediction. Thus far, several authors have discovered clinically
suitable early post-transplant markers for SGF/DGF prediction
[34,35]; however, our team concentrates on finding pre- and/or
perioperative SGF/DGF predictors [16,19,20,36]. In the current
study, we described novel pre- and perioperative markers (activity
of platelet G6P and catalase, respectively) that have a sensitivity of
up to 80–90% and therefore seem to be promising tools for
prediction of post-transplant outcome in the future. Unfortunately,
at this stage of our research, these markers do not seem suitable for
independent decision making because of their low specificity.
Moreover, their cut-off and predictive values must be verified in
further cohort studies.
Nevertheless, our study demonstrated that the early phase of
kidney allograft reperfusion is associated with intensified oxidative
stress and is accompanied by significant changes in the activity/
levels of platelet antioxidants, whose actions may contribute to
limitation of the perioperative intensity of oxidative stress. Our
study also highlighted the lack of ‘‘full’’ activity of platelet
antioxidative armament as a potential biochemical explanation for
problems associated with post-transplant graft activation. Finally,
we also demonstrated that the perioperative activity of selected
platelet antioxidants may help differentiate between EGF and
SGF/DGF.
