Abstract
Background: At present, renal grafts are the most common solid organ transplants world-wide. Given the importance of
renal transplantation and the limitation of available donor kidneys, detailed analysis of factors that affect transplant survival
are important. Despite the introduction of new and effective immunosuppressive drugs, acute cellular graft rejection (AR) is
still a major risk for graft survival. Nowadays, AR can only be definitively by renal biopsy. However, biopsies carry a risk of
renal transplant injury and loss. Most important, they can not be performed in patients taking anticoagulant drugs.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We present a non-invasive, entirely image-based method to assess AR in an allogeneic rat
renal transplantation model using small animal positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). 3 h after
i.v. injection of 30 MBq FDG into adult uni-nephrectomized, allogeneically transplanted rats, tissue radioactivity of renal
parenchyma was assessed in vivo by a small animal PET-scanner (post operative day (POD) 1,2,4, and 7) and post mortem
dissection. The mean radioactivity (cps/mm3 tissue) as well as the percent injected dose (%ID) was compared between graft and
native reference kidney. Results were confirmed by histological and autoradiographic analysis. Healthy rats, rats with acute CSA
nephrotoxicity, with acute tubular necrosis, and syngeneically transplanted rats served as controls. FDG-uptake was significantly
elevated only in allogeneic grafts from POD 1 on when compared to the native kidney (%ID graft POD 1: 0.5460.06; POD 2:
0.5860.12; POD 4: 0.8160.06; POD 7: 0.7760.1; CTR: 0.2260.01, n = 3–28). Renal FDG-uptake in vivo correlated with the results
obtained by micro-autoradiography and the degree of inflammatory infiltrates observed in histology.
Conclusions/Significance: We propose that graft FDG-PET imaging is a new option to non-invasively, specifically, early
detect, and follow-up acute renal rejection. This method is potentially useful to improve post-transplant rejection
monitoring.

Introduction
The number of patients necessitating treatment for end-stage
renal disease, and therefore, the number of patients with renal
transplants still increases [1]. At present, renal grafts are the most
common solid organ transplants world-wide. Despite the intro￾duction of new and effective immunosuppressive drugs, acute
cellular graft rejection is still a major risk for graft survival. In a
recently published follow-up analysis of over 28000 renal allograft
recipients, more than 4000 patients experienced at least one
episode of acute rejection (AR) within 3 years (21.6% experienced
even more than one AR in the first postoperative year). 83.2% of
these acute rejections occurred within the first 3 months post￾transplantation [2]. Episodes of acute allograft rejection are a
negative prognostic factor for the development of chronic renal
allograft failure (CAF) and for long-term graft survival [2–4]. The
impact of AR on chronic renal allograft failure rises, whereas the
severity of episodes was identified as an independent risk factor
[4,5]. CAF remains the most common cause for death-censored
graft-loss after renal transplantation [6,7]. Post-transplant moni￾toring basically relies on monitoring of renal retention parameters,
like creatinine and urea, in addition to the observation of non￾specific symptoms frequently present in AR, i.e., proteinuria,
oliguria, hypertension, graft tenderness, or peripheral edema.
(Doppler-) Ultrasound examination can detect rejection-related
irregularities in the graft perfusion, but its specificity and sensitivity
for AR is limited, even when echo enhancers are applied [8,9].
Furthermore, sensitivity and reliability of this method mainly
depend on the investigators experience. Radionuclide-based
methods for the measurement of renal function, i.e., TER￾PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5296

MAG-clearance, can disclose impairment of renal function, but
might be of limited value, if acute tubular necrosis or cyclosporine
A toxicity are involved [10,11]. Invasive core needle biopsies are
still the ‘‘gold-standard’’ in rejection diagnostics [12,13]. Never￾theless, they are cumbersome to the patient and carry the risk of
significant hematuria, arteriovenous fistulas, and graft loss [14,15].
Notably, they can not be performed on patients taking
anticoagulant drugs. Therefore, a non-invasive tool for specific
detection of AR, which can be applied in the early phase of
rejection, is desirable.
AR of renal grafts is characterized by recruitment of activated
leukocytes into the transplant [16,17], which is an integral part of
the basic concept of the Banff-classification, a commonly used
renal rejection score [12]. Activated leukocytes show a distinct
accumulation of 18F-Fluor-Desoxy-Glucose (FDG) which can be
measured by positron emission tomography (PET) [18]. FDG￾PET is widely used for detection, staging and follow-up of
inflammation or tumors, respectively [18,19].
The aim of this study was to establish and validate an entirely
image-based method for the early detection and follow-up of renal
allograft rejection in rats in order to translate this approach to
human patients in the future. It is based on high-resolution whole
body small animal PET following i.v. injection of FDG. FDG￾uptake of renal parenchyma was assessed in uni-nephrectomized,
allogeneically kidney-transplanted animals (aTX) with, and
additionally in native controls (CTR) and syngeneically trans￾planted (sTX) animals without rejection or impairment of renal
function. Because acute cyclosporine A nephrotoxicity (CSA) is a
reversible process in which renal function can recover if the drug
administration is stopped at the early stage of the disease,
differential diagnosis of this disease with other renal dysfunctions
that occur after kidney transplantation is of interest. In particular,
acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by ischemia/reperfusion
injury during the transplantation procedure shows a similar
clinical course. Therefore, we included two additional groups into
the study. One group with acute CSA nephrotoxicity and another
with renal ischemia/ reperfusion damage developing acute tubular
necrosis (ATN). PET results in vivo were compared to FDG-activity
of renal parenchyma in micro-autoradiography and in transplants
to histological changes of acute renal rejection (glomerulitis,
tubulitis, endothelialitis, and infiltration) ex vivo.
Results
Analysis of PET images and quantitative evaluation
In allografts undergoing AR, we detected a clearly elevated FDG￾uptake starting on postoperative day 1 (POD) (Figure 1), when
compared to the contralateral reference kidney (aTX/
CTR = 2.7460.96, n = 5). The allograft/control-ratio peaked on
POD 4 (3.3660.45, n = 5, Figure 1C). We conclude that early
detection of AR by PET analysis is possible, when the FDG-uptake of
control and grafted kidney is compared. Nevertheless, patients usually
lack a control kidney, thus a measurement independent of a reference
organ would be preferable. Liver is often referred to as a reference
organ. However, PET referring to FDG-uptake of liver needs fasting
of subjects, which limits serial investigation in small animals having
undergone surgery. Therefore, we used the previously calculated
FDG-uptake ratios of the reference (native) kidney to their allogeneic,
syngeneic transplant or to their second native kidney (healthy
controls), respectively. Then, we assessed the percentage of FDG￾uptake (% injected dose, %ID) within the parenchyma of the graft or
the remaining native kidney, respectively. FDG-uptake of grafted
kidneys (in %ID) showed a significant correlation to the ratio of FDG￾uptake of graft to control kidney (R2= 0.69, Figure 2). Thus, %ID
replacing the ratio graft/control analogously reflects the ‘‘rejection
status’’ (aTX.sTX.control) of the measured kidney. %ID of aTX
grafts (0.5460.06%, n = 5 vs. CTR: 0.2560.03%, n = 25) increased
starting from POD 1 (Figure 3) and peaked towards POD 4
(0.5860.12% POD 2 and 0.860.06% POD 4, n = 5), while %ID of
the control kidneys remained constantly low (0.260.02% on day 4,
n = 10). From POD 4 to POD 7 no significant change in %ID of
allografts and controls was observed (0.7760.1%, n = 5, vs.
0.2160.02% in CTR, n = 5). When comparing the %ID of syngeneic
transplanted controls at the maximum activity time point in aTX at
POD 4, %ID in sTX was significantly lower than in aTX and only
slightly higher than the %ID of native kidneys (0.3760.02%, n = 5)
(Figure 3). The FDG uptake of kidneys with acute tubular necrosis

the parenchyma (yellow circle) of renal allograft accumulates FDG with a maximum on POD 4, the native kidney (green circle) does not show any
accumulation at any time. Please note that the renal pelvis can contain eliminated FDG. Therefore, it was excluded from the measurements.

was not significantly different to that of control kidneys.
Assessment of renal function by calculation of the renal
fluoride clearance
We assessed renal 18F-fluoride clearance in a subgroup of
animals to exclude decreased renal function as a potential cause
for increased FDG-uptake into the renal parenchyma. FDG￾uptake (%ID) did not correlate to 18F-fluoride-clearance
(R2= 0.005; Figure 4).
Micro-autoradiographic quantification of FDG-uptake of
renal parenchyma
Examination of inflamed tissue by autoradiography has
previously shown that FDG-accumulation is correlated to cellular
infiltrates in different pathophysiological scenarios [20]. Therefore,
we have chosen autoradiography as a reference method to validate
FDG-PET results. In each recipient, radioactivity of renal
parenchyma (mean activity in cpm/mm2
/MBq) of the reference
kidney was compared to the radioactivity of the graft. POD 4 was
chosen for autoradiography, because FDG-uptake in allografts
peaked at this time point in PET, nonetheless the integrity of the
graft was still intact as confirmed by histology (Figure 5A). On
POD 4, allograft FDG-uptake was 7.4261.61 times (n = 3,
p,0.05 vs. CTR and sTX) higher than uptake of controls,
whereas FDG-uptake in sTX, ATN, and acute CSA nephrotox￾icity was not statistically different from CTR (sTX: 1.5460.05,
ATN: 1.5960.11, CSA: 0.8160.09 times of control, n = 3). An
exemplary measurement is shown in Figure 6.
The rat kidney consists of renal pelvis (7.360.6%), medulla
(15.860.5%) and cortex (76.960.9%) as confirmed by micro￾dissection (n = 14). In PET, FDG-uptake of renal parenchyma was
measured with exclusion of renal pelvis. Therefore, theoretically
17.160.6% of the signal measured by PET can be attributed to the
medulla and 82.960.6% to the cortex. Hence, the key question was
still, if the FDG-uptake of medulla and cortex equals. Discriminat￾ing medulla and cortex for certain can only be performed, if visually

Figure 3. Detection of acute rejection by measurement of the %ID of FDG within renal allografts. Kidneys undergoing acute rejection
showed a clearly increased FDG-uptake starting from the first postoperative day (POD 1) (0.5460.06%, n = 5 vs. 0.2260.02%, n = 13, in controls). The
%ID of allogeneic transplants rose further until POD 4 (0.5860.12%, n = 5, POD 2, and 0.8160.06%, n = 5, POD 4), while that of native kidneys
remained the same (0.260.03%, n = 5, day 4). Towards POD 7 the %ID of allografts remained stable (0.7760.1%, n = 5). The %ID of syngeneic
transplanted controls was 0.3760.04% (n = 5, POD 4). This was not significantly different to controls but to aTX (p,0.05). The FDG uptake of kidneys
with acute tubular necrosis (ATN: POD1: 0.2560.02%, POD2: 0.2160.04%, POD4: 0.3160.02%, n = 3) or acute cyclosporine A toxicity (CSA:
0.2460.03%, POD2: 0.1960.01%, POD4: 0.1660.01%, n = 3) was not significantly different to that of control kidneys.

confirmed. Therefore, we have chosen to investigate FDG-uptake of
medulla and cortex by autoradiography. In native kidneys and
syngeneic grafts, the renal medulla possesses an FDG-uptake, which
is 1.8860.18 (CTR) or 1.9860.08 (sTX) times higher than the
matching renal cortex, respectively (Table 1). Therefore,
72.160.8% of PET signal can be taken as a signal of renal cortex
and 27.960.8% of renal medulla.
The FDG-ratio of medulla and cortex (MC-ratio) changes in
kidneys undergoing AR. In contrast to graft medulla, the cortex of
aTX revealed a distinct higher FDG-uptake than the renal cortex of
CTR and sTX. Therefore, the MC-ratio of aTX dropped to
1.3960.08. As confirmed by HE-staining (data not shown), a lower
ratio was linked to a more intense infiltrate in the cortex than in the
medulla. In summary, we found that areas with increased FDG￾uptake coincide with areas of inflammatory cell infiltrate.
Histology
Signs of acute rejection are glomerulitis, tubulitis, endothelia￾litis, and graft infiltration [12,21]. During allograft rejection,
leukocytes are recruited into the organ [16,17]. These highly
activated leukocytes accumulate FDG, which can be quantified by
PET [18]. Starting from POD 1, we found marked glomerulitis,
tubulitis, endothelialitis, and graft infiltration in the aTX group
(Table 2, Figure 5A). Signs of acute rejection increased until POD
4. Nevertheless, the integrity of the graft was still preserved. In
contrast, graft recovery on POD 7 revealed a loss of integrity due
to necrosis and hemorrhage (Figure 5A). As demonstrated
(Figure 5, Table 2), no histological signs of rejection were found
in controls (1261 leukocytes/field of view (FOV), ti0 (total
interstitial inflammation score, Table 2), n = 18) or sTX (2664
leukocytes/FOV, ti0, n = 6). Allograft infiltration was already
existent on POD 1 (Figure 5B, 7762 leukocytes/FOV, p,0.05 vs.
sTX and CTR, ti1–2, n = 6), aggravated on POD 2 (98612
leukocytes/FOV, ti2–3, n = 6), peaked on POD 4 (14264
leukocytes/ FOV, ti3, n = 6), and decreased slightly on POD 7
(115615 leukocytes/FOV, ti3, n = 6). Primary renal morphologic
lesions in CSA treated animals included proximal tubule collapse
and vacuolization and, less frequently, interstitial edema and
vacuolization of interstitial cells (POD 4, leukocytes: 761/FOV,
n = 6). Kidneys with ischemia/reperfusion damage presented
histological signs of ATN, i.e., tubular dilation, swelling, and
necrosis, in addition to intraluminal brush border debris, protein
casts and marginal infiltration (leukocytes: 1763/FOV, n = 3) .
Correlation of FDG-uptake in renal parenchyma to the
inflammatory infiltrate
To verify our hypothesis that the uptake of FDG (%ID) is directly
related to the degree of inflammatory infiltration and thereby to the
grade of AR, we correlated the leukocytes/FOV of each group
(aTX POD 1, 2, 4, 7, sTX, ATN, CSA-induced nephrotoxicity, and
native controls) to their according %ID (Figure 7). This correlation
was found strongly significant (R2= 0.96).
How accurate is FDG-PET for the diagnosis of AR in rat?
We evaluated the ability of FDG-PET to discriminate between
kidneys from different control models (sTX, CSA-toxicity, ATN, and
Figure 5. Signs of acute rejection, namely glomerulitis, tubulitis, endothelialitis, and graft infiltration, were found in the allograft
group (aTX) starting from POD 1 (A). Nevertheless, graft integrity was confirmed on POD 1, 2, and 4. In contrast, histology of POD 7 showed the
appearance of necrosis and hemorrhage within the allograft. No histological signs of rejection were found in native controls (leukocytes: 1261/FOV,
n = 18) or syngeneic transplants (sTX) (leukocytes: 2664/FOV, n = 6). Leukocyte infiltration in kidneys with acute tubular necrosis (ATN, POD4,
leukocytes: 1763/FOV, n = 3) was moderate and emphasized in the outer medulla, while kidneys with acute cyclosporine toxicity (CSA) presented
with only 761/FOV leukocytes (POD 4, n = 6). In allografts significant infiltration was found since POD 1 (B) (leukocytes: 7762/FOV, all groups p,0.05
vs. sTX and CTR, n = 6). It aggravated on POD 2 (leukocytes: 98612/FOV), peaked on POD 4 (leukocytes: 14264/FOV), and was slightly lower on POD 7
(leukocytes: 11562/FOV).

native controls) and individuals with acute allograft rejection by a
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Figure 8 shows the
corresponding ROC curve and area under the curve (AUC). The
AUC was 0.973. Specificity (true negative rate) and sensitivity of
FDG-PET for detection of AR were calculated (Table 3) and with
98.8% and 92.0%, respectively, found also very high in our model.
Discussion
In this study, we present high resolution small animal FDG￾PET as a new approach for non-invasive imaging of acute renal
allograft rejection in rats. We found a significant correlation of the
entirely image-based measurement of enhanced FDG-uptake (cpm/
mm2
/MBq and %ID) in transplants undergoing rejection to
reference methods, i.e., to the histological quantification of
infiltrating leukocytes (Figure 5B and 7). In contrast, native
controls lacking signs of acute rejection in histological examination
(Figure 5A), showed only low, baseline FDG-uptake which
correlated significant with the histological examination (Figure 7).
In addition, histological evaluation of syngeneic transplants did not
reveal significant glomerulitis, tubulitis, endothelialitis, and only
marginal graft infiltration (ti0) (Figure 5, Table 2). This marginal

FDG, 4 days after surgery or treatment, respectively. Control kidneys (A–C, right kidneys) showed low mean FDG-uptake/mm2 in the mid￾coronary slice. FDG-uptake of the allograft (A, aTX: 1.22 cpm/mm2
/MBq) increased by nearly 7 times when compared to control (A, CTR: 0.18 cpm/
mm2
), while the FDG uptake in the syngeneic transplant (B, sTX: 0.26 cpm/mm2
) was 1.52 times that of control (B, CTR: 0.17 cpm/mm2
). FDG-uptake
of the kidney with ATN (C, ATN: 0.19 cpm/mm2
) was 1.58 times that of control (C, CTR: 0.12 cpm/mm2
), while the FDG-uptake in the kidneys with
acute CSA toxicity (D, left: 0.13 cpm/mm2
, right: 0.14 cpm/mm2
) was even lower. Notably, in ATN the FDG-uptake clearly emphasizes the outer
medulla region.

infiltration may be attributed to transplantation-associated ische￾mia-reperfusion damage [22]. Rats with acute CSA nephrotoxicity
or kidneys with histological signs of ATN did show neither
significant elevation in FDG-uptake nor extended infiltration with
leukocytes. In case of ATN this might be due to the fact that the
infiltration observed emphasizes the outer medulla (as seen in
histology and autoradiography) which contributes to a small
amount only to the total renal FDG-uptake. In autoradiography, a
second reference method used, the FDG-uptake of allogeneic
transplants was distinctly higher than the uptake of kidneys with
CSA toxicity, ATN, native controls or sTX (Figure 6, Table 1).
To evaluate diagnostic tests, ROC curves and AUC can be
calculated [23]. The best possible prediction method would yield a
point in the upper left corner or coordinate (0/1) of the ROC
space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100%
specificity (no false positives). Interpretation of the AUC is easier:
the higher the AUC, the better, with 0.5 indicating random
performance and 1.0 denoting perfect performance. Figure 8
shows the corresponding ROC curve; the area under the curve
was 0.973, indicating a high overall accuracy. In order to provide
an optimal diagnostic cut-off value for the FDG-PET, the
Euclidean distance was calculated. We propose a graft value of
0.36% ID FDG, which seems to be the optimal compromise
between sensitivity and specificity.
Drainage of FDG into the renal pelvis might be a problem when
assessing FDG-uptake in the renal parenchyma. Therefore, we
have chosen late acquisitions three hours after injection to reduce
the instantaneous amount of tracer in the urine during the PET
scan. The time interval for acquisition was defined according to
results of dynamic FDG-investigations which showed a very low
and stable renal FDG-uptake after 180 min p.i.. An impact of
renal function on FDG-uptake was excluded by comparison of
renal fluoride clearance to FDG-uptake, which did not correlate
(Figure 4) [24].
It is of note, that not simply the average activity of renal
parenchyma revealed discrepancies between rejected and kidneys
not undergoing rejection. Controls possess a certain medulla to
cortex (MC) ratio of FDG-uptake. This MC-ratio was identical to
the MC-ratio of syngeneic transplants, but significantly decreased
in rejected allografts (Table 1). One reason for these differences
might be the accentuation of the rejection-related infiltrate in the
renal cortex as observed in histology [25]. Verification of our
hypothesis that the MC-ratio changes in AR by small animal PET
failed due to small volumes of rat kidneys and resolution
limitations. We were regrettably unable to differentiate the activity
of renal parenchyma for certain into medulla- and cortex-related
tissue-activity. Nevertheless, our observation might be useful in
PET-based detection of AR in humans, since the MC-ratio could
be easily calculated by defining and measuring two volumes of
interest in a kidney transplant: one volume (medulla) placed distal
of the renal pelvis, the other next to the borders of the kidney
(cortex). This should be evaluated in future studies in humans.
Functional imaging with FDG is widely used (and therefore
available in common) in clinical setups, e.g., diagnosis and staging
of malignant disease, in image-guided therapy planning, and
detection and grading of inflammation, be it infectious, autoim￾mune, or of other origin [26,27]. On one hand, FDG-uptake is
specific and unique for detection of enhanced metabolic activity.
On the other hand, metabolic activation, and therefore FDG￾uptake, is not disease-specific. Thus, graft infection or tumors
might cause similar FDG-uptake in PET. Nevertheless, if clinical
symptoms, pointing to malignancy (weight loss, night sweat, etc.),
or to urinary tract infection (fever, dysuria, etc.), are present target￾orientated, additional diagnostics, like ultrasound, blood or urine
tests, should be applied.
One might worry about the exposure to radiation when applied
to humans, but the dosage applied, is rather low and close to other
clinical investigation techniques, e.g., lower than the dosage which
is applied during an abdominal computer tomography. In addition
and in contrast to several contrast media used in computer
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, the tracer is neither
toxic to kidney nor carries the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
A relevant diagnostic problem in case of graft dysfunction might
be the discrimination of AR and CAF. CAF also featuring a

FDG-PET in Rat Renal Rejection
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5296

certain degree of allograft infiltration is the most common reason
for graft loss [6,7,12]. In this case, the time point of occurrence of
the symptoms, and the kinetic of the process might be helpful.
According to the Banff-criteria and in contrast to AR, the kinetic
of CAF is rather slow, its degree lower, and besides, its typical
histological infiltration pattern rather nodular than diffuse [12].
This might offer a diagnostic pattern in PET analysis. Graft FDG￾PET may also be useful in monitoring therapy effects, for instance,
illustrating the impact of immunosuppressive therapy escalation.
In conclusion, we present and validate a non-invasive, entirely
image-based method to assess acute renal rejection using FDG￾PET. We suggest that this method may have a potential clinical
impact for the diagnosis of AR and may be useful to discriminate
AR from ATN and acute CSA-induced nephrotoxicity, in patients
with severe contraindications to perform graft biopsy.
Materials and Methods
Animal models
Male Lewis–Brown-Norway (LBN) and Lewis (LEW) rats (270–
330 g, Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) with free access to
standard rat chow (Ssniff, Soest, Germany) and tap water were
used. Experiments were approved by a governmental-committee
on animal welfare (Landesamt fu¨ r Natur, Umwelt und Verbrau￾cherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen) and were performed in accor￾dance with national animal protection guidelines. Surgeries were
performed under anesthesia with ketamine 100 mg/kg body
weight intra peritoneal (i.p.) and xylazine 5 mg/kg BW i.p.
(CEVA Tiergesundheit, Du¨ sseldorf, Germany). Further doses of
ketamine were injected as needed. Transplantation was simulta￾neously performed by two investigators as published before [28–
30]. In short, the left kidney including ureter, renal artery, a piece
of aorta, and renal vein were transferred into the recipient.
Kidneys from age- and weight-matched LBN were transplanted
into LEW (aTX, n = 24) or LBN (sTX, n = 6) without immuno￾suppression. Transplantations were performed immediately after
left nephrectomy of the recipient. While the total operation time of
the recipient did not exceed 90 min, the ischemia time of the graft
was always shorter than 40 min. The chosen aTX model leads to
histological and functional changes typical for acute rejection
[29,31]. Grafts and control kidneys were recovered on day 1, 2, 4,
or 7 after transplantation. ATN and acute CSA toxicity were
induced in a modification according to Kim et al.[32]. Ischemia/
reperfusion injury model (ATN, n = 3) was prepared by temporary
ligation of the left renal artery for 40 minutes. Renal artery was
dissected as in TX-groups and ligated using a microvascular
clamp. After clamp release, the returning of original surface colour
of the kidneys was confirmed visually. For acute CSA-induced
nephrotoxicity, rats were treated with 50 mg/kg cyclosporine A
(Sandimmun, Novartis, Nu¨rnberg, Germany) i.p. for two days
before PET-measurements and kidney recovery on day 4 (n = 3).

Figure 8. Receiver Operator Curve for diagnostics of acute rat
renal allograft rejection by FDG-PET. The curve is the regression
line that summarizes the overall diagnostic accuracy. A perfect
prediction would yield AUC = 1 (area under the curve), whereas
AUC = 0.5 would suggest predictive accuracy equal to that of chance
alone. Thus, the area measures discrimination that is, the ability of the
test to correctly classify those with and without the disease. AUC was
0.973.

FDG-PET in Rat Renal Rejection
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5296

Image acquisition – PET
Clinical grade 18F-fluoride and FDG were produced on site
using an RDS 111 cyclotron (CTI, Knoxville, TE, USA). The
FDG-uptake was calculated from a whole body acquisition of
30 min length in a high-resolution small animal PET scanner
3 hours after i.v. injection of 30 MBq FDG in 100 ml 0.9% NaCl
solution in a tail vein.
Afterwards the catheter was purged with additional 900 ml 0.9%
NaCl solution. The animals remained in a restrainer without
anaesthesia until start of the scan and were hydrated by i.v.
injection of 1000 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution hourly. Acquisition
started 3 h after FDG-injection to reduce tracer uptake in the
kidneys caused by renal excretion of FDG.
During acquisition, rats were anaesthetized with oxygen/
isoflurane inhalation (2% isoflurane, 0.7 l/min oxygen) and body
temperature was maintained at physiological values by a heating
pad. PET scans were performed with the high-resolution multi￾wire chamber-based animal PET camera quadHIDAC (Oxford
Positron Systems Ltd, Oxford, UK). The field of view (FOV) of the
PET scanner is 28 cm axially and 17 cm in diameter. The spatial
resolution of the PET scanner is ,1.0 mm and is constant over the
whole FOV [33].
The FDG-PET acquisition was followed by i.v. injection of
5 MBq 18F-fluoride without motion of the position of the rat in the
scanner. Another PET acquisition of 15 min length was
immediately initiated after 18F-fluoride injection for identification
of renal parenchyma (volume of interest, VOI) or of 60 min for
measurement of fluoride clearance.
Analysis of PET images and quantitative evaluation
FDG-uptake. A renal parenchyma VOI manually traced
around the kidneys on reconstructed images 2 min after 18F￾fluoride injection was transferred to the FDG images. The renal
pelvis was carefully excluded from the VOI. Mean FDG-uptake of
the renal parenchyma was calculated by the ratio of total counts
and volume.
Fluoride Clearance. Renal fluoride clearance and spilt renal
function was calculated by the ratio of the renal excreted activity
60 min p.i. and the integral of the blood pool time activity curve in
a subgroup of acquisitions (n = 22) as recently described [24].
High-resolution micro-autoradiography. To validate the
signal obtained by PET animals were euthanized and the kidneys
were harvested immediately after FDG-scanning on POD 4. High￾resolution micro-autoradiography (m-imager, Biospace Measures,
Paris, France) was performed on cryosections (10 mm thick) of
snap-frozen transplant or normal kidney. Two regions of interest
were visually identified and mean activity (cpm/mm2
) was
measured for 3 h. One region was defined as the medulla￾region, the other as the cortex-region. A ratio medulla/cortex
(MC-ratio) was calculated. Additionally, a more ‘‘realistic’’ mean
whole kidney-radioactivity (parenchyma: 75% cortex, 25%
medulla), was calculated as followed: (mean activity of medulla
[cpm/mm2
/MBq+mean activity of cortex [cpm/mm2
/MBq] *
3)/4.
Histology
Portions of kidneys were snap-frozen and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde in PBS. Histological changes (glomerulitis, tubulitis,
endothelialitis, and infiltration) were examined by light microscopy
in paraffin-embedded tissue with hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining.
Graft infiltration was quantified according to the ti-score (total
interstitial inflammation score, Table 2), which was recently added
to the Banff classification [21]. The basic concept of the Banff
classification is that the amount of the interstitial infiltrate and the
severity of the tubulitis indicate the grade of cellular rejection.
Infiltrating cells were determined by counting and averaging the
number of leukocytes present within 10 fields of view (FOV,
3506250 microns each) in the renal cortex. Cortex was chosen,
because quantification of medullary inflammation is not a reliable
indicator of AR [25].
ROC Curve
The joint distribution of true positive and true negative rates
was summarized as a ROC curve (Figure 8), which is used to
evaluate diagnostic tests [23]. All ROC curves begin in the
bottom-left corner and rise to the top-right corner. Moving along
the ROC curve represents trading off false positives for false
negatives. The calculated regression curve indicates the distribu￾tion of the paired sensitivity and specificity values. The AUC
represents an analytical summary of test performance and displays
the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
Statistics
Data was analyzed by the help of standard software (SPSS 13.0).
Laboratory data was compared with ANOVA variance analysis
for multiple comparisons where appropriate. Data is presented as
mean values6SEM (n = number of rats, samples, or experiments).
Significance was inferred at the p,0.05 level.
