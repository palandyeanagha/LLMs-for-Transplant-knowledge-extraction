Introduction
Lung transplantation is the only method currently available
to return patients with end-stage pulmonary disease to
normal life. The success of lung transplantation has
improved since its inception as a result of the introduction
of new surgical techniques, improved immunosuppressive
protocols and innovations in managing acute rejection and
infection. The survival rate of recipients is currently 71% at
1 year and 46% at 5 years [1]. The major complication,
which affects about 50% of patients who survive beyond
3 months, is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) [2,3]. Although
the precise etiology is not known, the most likely cause is
chronic allograft rejection.
OB is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the
bronchial epithelium and leading to the gradual oblitera￾tion of small and large airways by inflammatory infiltrate,
proliferating fibroblasts, mature collagen and extracellular
matrix [4]. The syndrome has two distinct phases, an
alloimmune phase with lymphocytic infiltration of the bron￾chiolar structures followed by a chronic fibroproliferative
phase leading to partial or total occlusion of the airway
lumen (see Fig. 1). The pathogenesis of OB appears to
involve a ‘response to injury’ type of pattern in which
episodes of potentially reversible acute rejection lead to
the irreversible state of chronic rejection. Acute rejection
is induced by repeated immune-mediated injury to the
epithelium and can be exacerbated by brain death in the
transplant donor, a condition that is thought to activate
inflammatory mediators and promote acute rejection [5].
This leads to the migration and proliferation of pulmonary
mesenchymal cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts,
the release of cytokines and the proliferation of cytotoxic
T lymphocytes, causing injury to the graft and leading to
connective tissue deposition [6] and luminal occlusion.
These processes are driven at least in part by the growth

Abstract
Heterotopic tracheal allografts in small rodents have been shown to share many characteristics with
the development of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) in the clinic and therefore provide a suitable animal
model for the study of OB. The model facilitates the examination of the pathogenesis of the disease
and the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in its development. The model
provides a less technically demanding alternative to whole lung transplantation in small rodents and
should lead to a speedier identification of new treatments that might prevent the development of post￾transplantation OB in the clinic.

factors platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). PDGF and bFGF have
been shown to be upregulated in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid from OB patients in the clinic [7].
Throughout the acute and chronic phases, immune
responses have an important role in the pathogenesis of
OB. T-helper cells, which recognise class II MHC antigens
expressed by the donor, drive the immune response; the
resulting antibodies cause acute and chronic rejection [8].
The clinical investigation of OB in humans is restricted by
the limited amount of biological material available from
patients. This makes the development of a simple animal
model that accurately reflects the development of OB in
humans a highly desirable goal.
The development of the tracheal allograft
model
Animal whole lung transplant models have been used
extensively to study the processes involved in chronic allo￾graft rejection [9,10]. This technique has the disadvantage
of being a time-consuming and technically difficult proce￾dure, especially in small rodents, limiting its use in testing
potential new treatments for OB. Other disadvantages of
the whole lung transplant are that obliterative lesions
require a substantial time to develop and are not always
evident in these models [11,12]. The procedure also often
results in damage to the parenchyma [13]. A simple exper￾imental animal model that mimics the development of
post-transplant OB in the clinic would aid in the study of
the disease and in the development of suitable treatments
to alleviate the condition.
Models of heterotopic tracheal allograft transplantation in
small rodents have been developed. This technique is less
technically demanding than whole lung transplants and
allows a greater number of procedures to be performed in
a short space of time, helping to reduce variability within
studies.
Site for transplantation
Initially, the site of choice for transplantation was the
omentum [14]. Hertz et al [13] then described a murine
model in which the trachea and main bronchi were trans￾planted from a BALB/c donor mouse into a subcutaneous
pouch in the dorsal surface of the neck of a C3H mouse.
The study demonstrated a simple technique that produced
lesions histologically indistinguishable from those
observed in humans. The choice of different strains for
donor and recipient mouse allowed the crossing of MHC
barriers, facilitating the study of the immunopathology of
OB. The loss of epithelium and the development of obliter￾ative lesions in the allografts but not the isografts sup￾Figure 1

ported the hypothesis that this is at least in part an
immune driven pathology. Epithelial denudation probably
results from an alloimmune response, with increased
expression of MHC class II antigens occurring on the allo￾graft epithelial cells, causing them to be targeted.
Several groups then compared different sites for tracheal
allograft transplantation in the rat [15,16] and further work
in the rat omentum model [17–20].
Boehler et al [16] conducted an elegant study in the rat
examining the development of OB at 14 time points from
1 day to 1 year. Studying two different transplantation sites,
the omentum and the dorsal subcutaneous pouch, they
demonstrated a triphasic time course. The initial ischaemic
phase (day 1 to day 7 with a peak at day 2) was seen in
both allografts and isografts (a second ischaemic phase
was seen in the allografts only, resolving by day 21). This
was followed by a marked lymphocytic infiltrative phase
(day 3 to a maximum at day 7, resolving by day 14) with
complete epithelial denudation (allografts only by day 9).
The third phase consisted of a fibrous obliteration of the
airway lumen, in allografts only (in many cases complete by
day 21). All allografts showed complete fibrotic obliteration
by day 28. This study confirmed the immune-mediated
nature of the lesion, because only allografts were adversely
affected. It also suggested the occurrence of a progressive
pathology in which immune-mediated epithelial injury leads
to overwhelming lymphocytic infiltration, which then
orchestrates the fibroproliferative response (see Fig. 1).
It is important to note that no differences were seen
between the pathology developing in the omentally
wrapped isografts and allografts and that developing in
those placed in the dorsal subcutaneous pouch. Because
revascularisation would be expected to occur more readily
in the omentally wrapped trachea than in the subcuta￾neous site, this suggests that, at least in this model,
ischaemia might not be a major factor in the development
of OB. This study validates the use of the subcutaneous
pouch for future work, a method less traumatic for the
animal and technically easier to perform. One possible
drawback to this method might be the position of the
transplantation site when handling animals for dosing. The
study confirms a preliminary study by Huang et al [15]
also demonstrating that development of the obliterative
lesion did not depend on the site of transplantation. The
study also showed an increase in T cells and class II MHC
antigens, supporting the case for an immune-mediated
injury. This led to an infiltration of macrophages, stimulat￾ing growth factors and leading to fibroblast proliferation
and occlusion.
Further work by Brazelton et al [21] removed the source of
immune reactivity by retransplanting the trachea from the
allogeneic recipient into an isogeneic strain of rat at 7 and
14 days after allografting. This demonstrated that tracheae
retransplanted at 7 days did not become obliterated,
whereas those transplanted at 14 days did occlude, thus
showing that after a certain point lesion development will
progress despite removal of the alloimmune stimulus.
Choice of animal
The work that followed was evenly distributed between
those using the omentum and those using the dorsal sub￾cutaneous neck pouch as a site for transplantation. The
work with the omentum has been performed exclusively in
the rat [18–36], whereas the subcutaneous site has been
used in both the mouse [38–45] and the rat [16,46–49].
The mouse confers some extra advantages over the rat in
that studies can be conducted in specific gene knockout
or transgenic animals or those with severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID), affording the opportunity to
dissect the mechanisms involved in the development of
OB. The mouse also has a size advantage in that much
smaller quantities of compound are required to screen
potential drug candidates.
Heterotopic transplantation has also been performed in
larger animals, the pig [50–52] and the primate [53]. In
these animals bronchial tissue has been transplanted sub￾cutaneously. Large animals enable the study of events in
smaller airways including bronchioli, where the disease
predominantly occurs in humans [54]. These models
might be useful in the study of the pathogenesis of OB,
but their size, housing costs and availability preclude their
routine use in drug screening programmes.
The small animal models described above will provide useful
tools for studying the pathology and processes involved in
the development of OB and may provide a robust model in
which to screen candidates for the treatment of OB.
Methodology
The main concerns when assessing methodology in these
models are which species to use, which strains to use as
donor and recipient and at what time point or points to
assess the progression of the lesion and the effect of any
treatment on that lesion.
The majority of the work to date has been performed in
rats and mice. It is important to select a donor and recipi￾ent that are mismatched in terms of their histocompatibility
(see Tables 1, 2 and 3) because in the clinic it has been
shown that MHC class I and II antigens are upregulated in
grafts that develop OB [8,55,56]. This fact was empha￾sised by Kelly et al [40], who subcutaneously transplanted
tracheae from BALB/c mice into C57BL/6 mice or SCID
C57BL/6 mice. The pathology in the tracheae in the SCID
mice was indistinguishable from that in isografts (BALB/c
to BALB/c), whereas the allografted C57BL/6 mice had
significant lesions.

In the rat, the trachea has been transplanted into the
omentum or the subcutaneous neck pouch, whereas in
the mouse all the published studies have employed the
subcutaneous pouch. The published data tend to agree
that in both rats [15,16,22,34] and mice [39,42] the time
to complete tracheal luminal obliteration, regardless of the
site chosen for allografting, is about 28 days after trans￾plantation. The published data also agree that in most
instances in rats [16,22] and mice [13] partial obliteration
occurs at 21 days after transplantation.

Therefore a tracheal allograft transplantation model in non￾histocompatible mice or rats with harvesting at 28 days
should provide a suitable model with which to study the
development of OB. Earlier time points can be added to a
study to determine the progression of the pathology. Later
time points have been employed to determine the involve￾ment of collagen and the development of luminal scar
tissue [16,41].
End point measurements
A wide variety of end points have been measured in these
models. Most studies determine epithelial coverage and
luminal occlusion with an assessment of the inflammatory
and proliferating cells involved. In some cases an assess￾ment of collagen type and deposition has been performed.
The pathology of the lesion has been studied in detail and
the cytokine/chemokine profile, growth factors and the
role of infection have been examined.
The epithelium has been examined by standard histological
techniques to determine the percentage of normal respira￾tory epithelium and the degree of ciliated epithelium. The
degree of epithelial coverage is often measured and necro￾sis is assessed. Luminal occlusion has been estimated
morphometrically using an ocular grid [28], or computed by
image analysis [22] or graded using a scoring system
[28,45]. Different groups have quantified the general
pathology of the lesion by a grading system [15,45] or
semiquantitatively by one experienced pathologist [22].
These procedures have been performed by one or more
observers blinded to the identification of the groups.
Assessment of cell proliferation has been performed by
using bromodeoxyuridine followed by treatment with an
IgG1 antibody to identify the proliferating cells [27]. Using
these techniques, the identity of some of the factors and
processes involved in the development of the obliterative
lesion in the tracheal allograft model has been revealed.
These are summarised in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
Pathology of the lesion
With regard to pathology, several studies have described
similar findings regardless of the animal or site of trans￾plantation. All studies have compared the development in
allografts with that in isografts. Hertz et al [13] have
described the pathology at 10 and 21 days in the mouse
subcutaneous transplant model. At 10 days they found
inflammation, epithelial denudation or necrosis or epithelial
abnormalities and early fibroproliferative changes. The
inflammation was primarily subepithelial but in some
instances it involved the peritracheal tissue. Lymphocytes
and neutrophils were the predominant cell types found,
and the presence of plasma cells was also observed. The
isografts had normal respiratory epithelium and normal or
near normal histology at 21 days. The allografts at 21 days
demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation and
luminal occlusion with the presence of vascularised,
fibrous granulation tissue. Similar findings were observed
in the rat subcutaneous transplant model [15,16].
At 14 days after transplantation, Reichenspurner et al [22]
found epithelial loss, neutrophilic infiltration of the mucosa
and submucosa and a marked mononuclear infiltrate mixed
with plasma and eosinophils. Again, complete fibrotic oblit￾eration was seen in the allografts by day 28. Adams et al
[33] have demonstrated the importance of the epithelium in
the development of OB. Using a rat tracheal isograft trans￾planted into the omentum, they removed the epithelium by
protease digestion before grafting. The isografts developed
luminal occlusion, an effect that was inhibited by reseeding
with epithelial cells. Brazelton et al [57], transplanting from
BN to Lewis rats, studied the change of phenotype as the
lesion developed, with donor cells being replaced by recip￾ient cells without significant loss of tissue organisation.
They observed that all cells, including migrating mesenchy￾mal cells, and connective tissue deposition within the graft
were of a recipient (Lewis) phenotype by day 28.
Huang et al [15] looked at the expression of antigens in
graft tissue at days 14 and 28 and also at the expression
of mRNA for PDGF and bFGF. They found that at both 14
and 28 days the macrophage antigens (ED-1 and ED-2),
α smooth muscle cell actin, T-cell antigen, CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, interleukin (IL)-2 receptors, MHC class II
antigens, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PDGF mRNA
and bFGF mRNA were all upregulated in the allografts in
comparison with the isografts. Neuringer et al [41] demon￾strated, in the mouse, at 14 days the presence of large
numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages in
allografts in comparison with isografts. They showed that
the CD4+/CD8+ ratio at 14 days was 0.75 and that at
6 weeks it was 2. At 6 weeks in this study there was a pre￾dominance of macrophages and myofibroblasts [recipi￾ents in this study were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA) at
25 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally, 5 days per week].
In addition, Boehler et al [16] showed that beyond
28 days the luminal granulation tissue became less cellular
and less vascular and showed increasing deposition of
collagen for up to 1 year. Kallio et al [28] looked at the role
of complement activation in the development of OB in the
rat. They demonstrated an increase in the within-graft
complement components C3 and C5b-9, the membrane
attack complex, and also increases in IgM and IgG during
the loss of epithelium and the development of airway
occlusion in allografts.
Cytokines involved in lesion development
The cytokine profile in these models has also been
studied. Boehler et al [47], using reverse transcriptase
mediated polymerase chain reaction, have shown that the
T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ were upreg￾ulated at 3, 7 and 21 days, whereas the Th2 cytokine
Respiratory Research Vol 2 No 3 Hele et al

IL-10 showed no change in allografts or isografts. They
also demonstrated that the neutrophil attractant
chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)
was expressed early in the development of the lesion,
whereas expression of the monocyte and lymphocyte
chemoattractants monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1) and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal
T-lymphocyte expressed and secreted) increased with
time. However, the increase in MIP-2 expression occurred
in both isografts and allografts. Suga et al [49], studying
the involvement of RANTES, showed that treating iso￾grafts with recombinant RANTES did not induce fibropro￾liferative airway obliteration despite increasing CD4+ T-cell
migration. However, treating allografts with a neutralising
anti-RANTES antibody reduced CD4+ T-cell influx and pre￾served luminal patency.
In a preliminary study, Belperio et al [58] showed in the
mouse that both MCP-1 and its receptor CCR-2 are
upregulated in tracheal allografts and that this increase is
correlated with monocyte recruitment. Neuringer et al
[42] studied the T-lymphocyte cytokine gene transcription
profile in allografts compared with isografts in the mouse
model. It should be noted that all recipient animals were
immunosuppressed (CsA, 25 mg/kg per day intraperi￾toneally 5 days per week) in this study. They showed that
in the allografts the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ, the Th2
cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, and the cytotoxic lymphocyte
product granzyme B were upregulated 2–10-fold
throughout lesion development. The expression of the
Th1 cytokines and granzyme B was greater than that of
the Th2 products. The production of all these gene tran￾scripts peaked within 2–4 weeks after transplantation,
the period corresponding to the intense T lymphocyte
infiltration in allografts.
Although both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were shown to be
upregulated in this study it did not preclude a protective
role for Th2 cytokines in graft rejection. A preliminary study
conducted by Takao et al [31] also showed exacerbation
of the obliterative lesion by administration of IL-2. This pro￾duced an increase in peritracheal lymphocyte infiltration
and accelerated luminal obliteration. Gu et al [37] also
showed that IL-2 exacerbated obliteration in allografts
even in the presence of CsA treatment but did not cause
luminal obliteration in isografts despite causing epithelial
loss and lymphocytic infiltration.
Growth factors involved in lesion development
Al-Dossari et al [59] looked at the effect of the administra￾tion of growth factors in the mouse isograft model and
showed that PDGF and bFGF administration produced a
fibroproliferative lesion in isografts similar to that previ￾ously seen in allografts, demonstrating that OB can
develop in the absence of an alloimmune injury. Kallio et al
[28] used a combination of immunostaining, polyclonal
antibodies and reverse transcriptase mediated polymerase
chain reaction to determine the involvement of PDGF iso￾forms and their receptors in the development of OB in the
rat tracheal allograft. They showed an increase in PDGF
receptor α and β mRNA expression and an increase in
PDGF-AA and PDGF receptor α immunoreactivity during
the loss of epithelium and the development of the fibrotic
occlusion, suggesting a regulatory role for PDGF in the
development of OB.
Role of nitric oxide in lesion development
Conflicting results have been obtained regarding the role
of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of OB. Kallio et al
[63] suggested that NO might have a protective role,
showing that by treatment with aminoguanidine, an
inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prolifer￾ation was enhanced and the obliterative lesion was
increased. They also showed that treatment with L-argi￾nine, a precursor for NO, reduced the obliteration in allo￾grafts. However, Romanska et al [35] have suggested that
NO might have a dual detrimental role. They demonstrated
that iNOS expression is not only increased during the
destruction of the epithelium but is also intense in fibro￾blasts as they undergo morphological changes during the
early part of the fibroproliferative stage. However, iNOS
expression is weak during the later occlusive phase of the
lesion. This suggests a role for NO in the destruction of
the epithelium and the stimulation of fibroblast activity.
Role of infection in lesion development
Three publications have looked at the role of rat
cytomegalovirus infection in the development of the oblitera￾tive lesion in rat tracheal allografts [23–25]. Lemstrom et al
[23] and Reichenspurner et al [24] showed that infection of
the recipient but not the donor exacerbated the develop￾ment of the lesion. Koskinen et al [25] showed that infection
with rat cytomegalovirus enhanced the epithelial expression
of MHC class II antigen and myofibroproliferation and sug￾gested that these changes might be mediated by an
increased expression of PDGF-AA and PDGF receptor α.
Pathological findings similar to those found in the rat and
mouse models have also been reported in bronchial allo￾grafts in the pig [51–53] and the primate [54].
This amounts to the current published knowledge of the
pathology, cells, cytokines, chemokines and growth
factors involved in the development of the obliterative
lesion in the tracheal allograft model. This information
might help in the identification of targets for drug interven￾tion in the development of the lesion.
Interventions that modify the development of
OB in the tracheal allograft model
The main emphasis of studies on drug treatment in these
models has involved immunosuppressants. Other studies
Available online http://respiratory-research.com/content/2/3/169
commentary review reports primary research

have examined the effects of compounds that interfere
with growth factors or the synthesis and release of
cytokines or chemokines. Various biological tools have
also been used to elucidate the mechanisms involved.
These studies are summarised in Tables 4, 5 and 6.
Immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressive agents are known to forestall tissue
rejection after organ transplantation by a variety of
methods. Several studies have examined the effects of
CsA, leflunomide (LFM), rapamycin (RPM), FK506,
deoxyspergualin (DSG), mycophenolate mofetil (MPM) or
mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the tracheal allograft model.
Davreux et al [17] were the first to examine the effect of
CsA in the model alone and in combination with methyl￾prednisolone. CsA is known to inhibit the activation and
proliferation of T lymphocytes and to inhibit cytokine syn￾thesis and secretion. CsA showed a dose dependent
preservation of the epithelium when tracheae were har￾vested at 14 days; this effect was increased by the addi￾tion of methylprednisolone. Koskinen et al [26] compared
the effects of CsA, DSG and MPM. DSG is thought to
suppress the actions of monocyte/macrophages [61] and
inhibit lymphocyte proliferation [62], whereas MPM
inhibits T lymphocyte and antibody responses and the pro￾duction of macrophage-derived cytokines [63] by selec￾tively blocking the de novo pathway of purine synthesis
[64]. CsA in this study decreased OB in a dose depen￾dent manner, preserved epithelium and reduced inflamma￾tion, whereas MPM reduced inflammation but had no
effect on OB. DSG reduced airway obliteration but did not
preserve epithelium or reduce inflammation.
In a preliminary study, Morris et al [19] compared five
immunosuppressant drugs with different mechanisms of
action: CsA, MPA, RPM, LFM and DSG. RPM is a
macrolide that acts by inhibiting signal transduction events
triggered by cytokines and growth factors that cause cell
cycle progression from G1 to S phase [65], unlike CsA or
FK506, which inhibit cytokine synthesis principally in
immune cells [66]. Treatment was started on day 0 or
day 7 after transplantation and tracheae were harvested
on days 14 and 28. When treatment was initiated on
day 0, all drugs promoted the retention of epithelium and
reduced airway narrowing; however, when treatment was
started on day 7, RPM was far more effective at reducing
luminal occlusion than both DSG and CsA.
In another study with several immunosuppressants, in
which tracheae were harvested on day 14, Morris et al
[18] showed that treatment from day 0 to day 13 with
RPM or LFM preserved the epithelium and reduced
luminal narrowing and the loss of intact respiratory
mucosa, whereas in rats treated with CsA or MPA, despite
a reduction in luminal narrowing, the peritracheal tissue
was thickened and the respiratory mucosa was absent or
abnormal. Brazelton et al [32] also studied the effects of
five immunosuppressants: CsA, RPM, DSG, LFM and
MPA. Tracheae were harvested at 3, 7, 14, 21 and
28 days and stained with antibodies specific for Brown
Norway or Lewis MHC class I antigens. They showed a
progressive infiltration of Lewis mononuclear cells at
days 3 and 7; by day 14 infiltrating Lewis mononuclear
and mesenchymal cells entered the lumen and by day 28
all cells within the lumen were of Lewis origin. None of the
treatments could halt the infiltration of Lewis recipient
cells into the donor trachea; however, some treatments
did maintain the presence of donor cells within the
trachea. This preservation of donor tissue was correlated
with the degree of inhibition of luminal obliteration.
Adams et al [34], using the same five immunosuppres￾sants, began treatment 0, 7 and 14 days after transplanta￾tion and harvested the grafts at 28 and 50 days. When
treatment began at day 0, LFM, RPM and CsA prevented
obliteration but only RPM was effective when treatment
began on day 7. When RPM treatment was delayed until
14 days its beneficial effects were largely lost. In this study
the compounds that preserved the epithelium or promoted
the regrowth of epithelium were the most effective at pre￾venting luminal obliteration. At 50 days after transplanta￾tion they showed that in each of the treatment groups,
despite the continuation of treatment, the occluding lesion
had progressed from that seen at day 28. This observation
might reflect the situation in the clinic where OB pro￾gresses despite continued immunosuppressive therapy. A
similar observation was made by Takao et al [31] in a pre￾liminary study in which CsA treatment was stopped at
28 days after allografting and the lesion occluded within a
further 28 days. This observation was confirmed by Gu et
al [37], who also showed that IL-2 could accelerate the
occlusive process despite the presence of CsA.
Hashimoto et al [36] adopted a different approach to
immunosuppression: they used minimal immunosuppres￾sion by giving FK506 (0.5, 1, 1.5 mg/kg/day i.m.) for the
first 3 days after transplantation. FK506 has a similar
profile to CsA but has a 100-fold greater potency [67].
The grafts were harvested at 28 days, and FK506, at the
top dose only, showed morphology that was similar to that
of isografts. The use of minimal immunosuppression in the
clinic would be highly desirable because the long-term
administration of high doses of immunosuppressants is
not without problems.
Fahrni et al [39] showed in the mouse that RPM signifi￾cantly inhibited luminal occlusion by fibroblastic tissue at
28 days even when treatment was initiated as late as
14 days after transplantation. RPM also inhibited
macrophage and peritracheal mononuclear inflammatory
infiltration. The beneficial effects produced by RPM might
be due in part to its reported anti-proliferative actions. Nair

et al [68] showed that it directly and dose-dependently
inhibited DNA synthesis by human adult lung fibroblasts,
which might explain its greater efficacy in vivo. Also in the
mouse, King et al [38] demonstrated that CsA given from
day 0 dose-dependently inhibited the fibroproliferative
occlusion in allografts harvested at day 30 without reduc￾ing epithelial injury or inflammation. One other study with
immunosuppressants compared MMF, FK506, CSA and
vitamin E (α-tocopherol) in the rat [69].
Although some of the data with immunosuppressants is
conflicting, the general consensus is that although their
effects are beneficial during the early stages of the lesion,
this might not translate into a long-term beneficial effect.
The dangers of prolonged use of immunosuppressive ther￾apies, such as nephrotoxicity and increased susceptibility
to infection, are well documented. Therefore the need for
better immunosuppressants or alternative pharmacologi￾cal interventions is great.
Other pharmacological interventions
Other pharmacological treatments that interfere with the
cytokines, growth factors or other agents involved in the
development of the obliterative lesion have been tested in
the tracheal allograft models.
Kallio et al [26] have shown that treatment with L-arginine
reduced the obliterative lesion as well as increasing within￾graft iNOS and NO production. L-Arginine also produced
an increase in the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, suggesting
a protective role for NO. Kallio et al [27] have also exam￾ined the effect of CGP 53716, a protein-tyrosine kinase
inhibitor selective for the PDGF receptor [70]. PDGF has
been shown to be a major mitogen for smooth muscle cells
and fibroblasts [71]. CGP 53716 was given alone and in
combination with a suboptimal dose of CsA. CGP 53716
was administered 24 h before transplantation and tracheae
were harvested at 3, 10 and 30 days. CsA at a low dose
did not inhibit tracheal occlusion, whereas CGP 53716

alone and in combination with CsA significantly inhibited
the development of OB. CGP 53716 did not affect airway
wall inflammatory cell proliferation, the number of infiltrating
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, ED3+ macrophages, IL-2 receptor
expression or MHC class II expression.
The role of angiotensin in OB has been examined in the rat
by MacLean et al [48]. Angiotensin II is thought to have a
role in the development of fibrotic diseases; it has been
found to have growth-promoting properties through
smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation,
transformation to myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix
deposition [72]. These effects are thought to be mediated
by the upregulation of transforming growth factor β1. The
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was
given from 5 days before transplantation or 1 or 5 days
after transplantation. Captopril given from 5 days before or
1 day after transplantation significantly inhibited airway
obliteration assessed at day 21. When administered 5 days
postoperatively, captopril was without effect. Further pre￾liminary data from the same group [73] examined the effect
of losartan, an angiotensin-1 receptor blocker. Administra￾tion began on postoperative day 1 or 5 and grafts were
harvested on day 21. When treatment started on day 1,
losartan was without effect, but when started 5 days after
transplantation it significantly reduced airway obliteration.
This paradox might involve transforming growth factor β1,
which has been shown to possess immunosuppressive
properties during the early part of the response to injury
[74] and to have fibroproliferative effects later on [75]. This
axis is clearly worthy of further investigation.
Biological interventions
Boehler et al [46] examined the effect of the anti-inflamma￾tory cytokine IL-10 in the rat tracheal allograft model. They
administered IL-10 by adenoviral gene transfer or in
recombinant form, showing that IL-10, regardless of the
method of delivery, inhibited the development of airway
obliteration assessed 21 days after transplantation.
However, as in the losartan study described above, the
treatment was effective only when started 5 days postop￾eratively and not when started immediately after transplan￾tation. Another interesting feature of this study was that
treatment with IL-10 did not preserve the epithelium or sig￾Available online http://respiratory-research.com/content/2/3/169

nificantly affect lymphocytic infiltration in allografts exam￾ined at 7 days. One reason suggested for this observation
is the time taken for the graft to revascularise and the fact
that IL-10 was administered at a site remote from the graft.
They further suggested that because IL-10 inhibited the
fibroproliferative response despite the absence of an
epithelium, it might provide a suitable treatment in situa￾tions where the epithelium is already damaged or missing.
Boehler et al [43] have studied the role of tumour necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) in allograft transplantation by the use of
gene knockouts in mice. They transplanted into animals
with a single knockout for TNF-α or a triple knockout for
TNF-α, TNF-β and IL-6. Grafts examined at day 21 demon￾strated that in the single TNF-α knockout the airway oblit￾eration in the allogeneic group was abolished and
inflammation was reduced, whereas in the triple knockouts
the obliteration was inhibited but an intense inflammatory
response was observed.
Kallio et al [60] showed that blockade of complement by
human soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1), an
inhibitor of the classical and alternative complement path￾ways, significantly reduced epithelial necrosis, neutrophil
infiltration and airway obliteration. Grafts were removed on
days 3, 10 and 30 and showed a reduction in IL-8 and
intercellular cell-adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression,
and an upregulation of IL-10 with subsequent downregula￾tion of IL-2 and TNF-α. However, sCR1 did not affect T-cell
or macrophage infiltration or the expression of IL-2 recep￾tor-α or MHC class II antigens. They therefore suggested
that treatment with sCR1 might shift the T-cell response
from a Th1 type response towards a Th2 type response,
thus producing an anti-proliferative cytokine profile.
Another approach reported by Gammie et al [29] involved
the preparation of mixed allogeneic chimeras by reconstitut￾ing lethally irradiated WF recipient rats with a mixture of T￾cell depleted syngeneic (WF) and allogeneic (ACI rats)
bone marrow cells. Mixed chimerism was present in all
animals 28 days after transplantation. Donor-specific or allo￾geneic tracheas were implanted and harvested at 30 days.
Mixed allogeneic chimerism was shown to induce donor￾specific tolerance and prevent the obstructive lesion across
major and minor histocompatibility barriers. The authors
suggested that this might provide a useful strategy in the
clinic if a low-risk conditioning regimen could be developed.
Szeto et al [45] have adopted a similar approach in mice
and suggest that the development of OB is dependent on
donor-specific antigen-presenting cells and occurs in the
absence of MHC class I or class II antigens. They sug￾gested that either CD4+ or CD8+ direct allorecognition is
important in the development of obliterative airway disease.
Yamada et al [44] examined the effect of treating allo￾grafted mice with CTLA4 IgG. CTLA4 is a T-cell activation
molecule and blocking its action interferes with the inter￾action of CD28 and B7, which provide a critical co-stimu￾latory signal for T-cell activation and proliferation against
alloantigens [76]. They showed that treatment with CTLA4
IgG markedly reduced luminal obliteration in allografts,
suggesting that this process is T-cell dependent.
However, treatment with CTLA4 IgG did not prevent the
replacement of normal columnar respiratory epithelial cells
by flattened attenuated epithelial cells and did not induce
donor specific unresponsiveness. The authors suggested
that these results demonstrate that luminal obliteration and
epithelial loss represent distinct disease processes.
Conclusion
In this review we have summarised the development of the
tracheal allograft model. We have detailed its pathogene￾sis, its potential to provide information about a variety of
end points and its usefulness as a system in which to test
interventions aimed at treating the chronic condition OB
that occurs after lung transplantation.
It would appear that, although much remains to be dis￾covered about the mechanisms of acute and chronic
rejection and the development of OB, a model like the
tracheal allograft has much to offer in terms of defining
the pathogenesis of the disease and elucidating the cel￾lular and molecular processes involved in its develop￾ment. The model has been shown to share many of the
characteristics of OB in the clinic in that heterotopic tra￾cheal allografts exhibit epithelial damage, lymphocytic
infiltration, low-level airway wall inflammation, with subse￾quent proliferation of myofibroblast-like cells, and
gradual occlusion of the airway lumen. During the early
phase the respiratory epithelium of the allografts strongly
expresses MHC class II antigens, allowing the direct pre￾sentation of antigens to alloreactive T cells. The recruit￾ment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages into
the airway wall induces cytokines and growth factors
derived from T cells and macrophages, leading to myofi￾broproliferation and OB.
Although much work has already been performed to
characterise the model and to determine the cells,
growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and other factors
involved in the development of the obliterative lesion,
much more needs to be done to complete our under￾standing of the mechanisms involved. The tracheal allo￾graft model in small rodents appears to present a viable,
less technically demanding alternative to whole lung
transplantation in these species. The ease with which
these studies can be performed should permit a speed￾ier resolution of the mechanisms involved in the develop￾ment of OB. This furthering of our knowledge may lead
to the identification of new treatments that could
prevent, suppress or halt the progression of post￾transplantation OB in the clinic.
