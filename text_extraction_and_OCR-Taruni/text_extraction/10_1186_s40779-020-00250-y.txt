Abstract
Background: Limb loss has a drastic impact on a patient’s life. Severe trauma to the extremities is common in
current military conflicts. Among other aspects, “life before limb” damage control surgery hinders immediate
replantation within the short post-traumatic timeframe, which is limited in part by the ischemic time for successful
replantation. Ex vivo limb perfusion is currently being researched in animal models and shows promising results for
its application in human limb replantation and allotransplantation.
Presentation of the hypothesis: The current lack of replantation possibilities in military operations with high rates of
amputation can be addressed with the development of a portable ex vivo limb perfusion device, as there are several
opportunities present with the introduction of this technique on the horizon. We hypothesize that ex vivo limb perfusion
will enable overcoming the critical ischemic time, provide surgical opportunities such as preparation of the stump and
limb, allow for spare-part surgery, enable rigorous antibiotic treatment of the limb, reduce ischemia-reperfusion injuries,
enable a tissue function assessment before replantation, and enable the development of large limb transplant programs.
Testing the hypothesis: Data from in vivo studies in porcine models are limited by the relatively short perfusion time of
24 h. In the military setting, notably longer perfusion times need to be realized. Therefore, future animal studies must
focus especially on long-term perfusion, since this represents the military setting, considering the time for stabilization of
the patient until evacuation to a tertiary treatment center.
Implications of the hypothesis: The development and clinical introduction of ex vivo limb perfusion in the military
setting could lead to a drastic reduction in the number of limb amputations among service members. Ex vivo limb
perfusion enables replantation surgery in Role 4 facilities and changes the clinical setting from a highly urgent, life￾threatening situation to a highly methodical, well-prepared starting point for optimal treatment of the wounded service
member. With its introduction, the principle of “life before limb” will change to “life before limb before elective
replantation/allotransplantation after ex vivo limb perfusion”.
Background
As early as 2008, a study from the United States pre￾dicted that by 2050, the number of amputations will in￾crease by 72% [1]. The impact on the patents’ life and
the socio-economic consequences of limb loss are re￾markable. Patients eventually lose their jobs, and finan￾cial problems and social descent have been shown to be
associated with limb loss, which often lead to psycho￾logical disorders (e.g., depression) [2].
The results of replantation surgery vary depending on
the cause of the amputation, the patient’s condition and
the quality of the specialized service provided. Further￾more, recent evidence underlines the role of allotransplan￾tation of limbs in opposition to prosthetic limb

replacement regarding functional outcomes and patient
satisfaction [3, 4]. Replantation surgery is a highly elaborate
microsurgical procedure that requires optimal interdiscip￾linary cooperation within an experienced team (for the
aftercare as well). Therefore, the first line of treatment is
limb salvage, though this is not feasible in every case. The
technically demanding surgical realization of replantation
is often not the only limiting factor, narrow time frames
due to ischemia also need to be kept in mind [5]. The inci￾dence of polytraumatized patients with life-threatening ex￾tremity injuries is increasing [5]. Especially in these cases,
the strategy of “life before limb” damage control surgery
within the short post-traumatic timeframe hinders replan￾tation, which is partly defined by the limited ischemic time
for successful replantation [4, 5]. This approach is basically
equivalent between civilian and military trauma care.
There have been two major studies investigating the
outcomes of reconstruction and amputation. The first
was the Lower Extremity Assessment Project (LEAP) [6],
which focused on civilian healthcare. The results suggest
that the functional outcomes of reconstruction and am￾putation are at least similar among civilians being treated
for major lower-extremity trauma [3, 4, 7]. Regardless of
the type of treatment, LEAP outcomes were not optimal,
with one-half of injured civilians reporting high levels of
disability. Military-specific data were analyzed by the
Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium in their
Military Extremity Trauma Amputation/Limb Salvage
(METALS) study [8]. The METALS study focuses on
major limb trauma in recent U.S. armed conflicts. In
summary, most of the analyzed parameters mirror the
LEAP results. Nevertheless, there are major differences
between the clinical setting for civilian and military
trauma amputation. The necessities of tactical evacuation
in combat lead to longer ischemic times. Furthermore,
the amputated limb is often highly contaminated with
debris and dirt. Blast injuries especially are concomitant
with a high degree of soft tissue trauma and a significant
loss of tissue. Data from registries and recent studies in￾dicate that approximately half of combat wounds
inflicted in modern warfare are extremity injuries [9–11].
For severe injuries, either amputation or limb salvage
procedures are the only options in the combat surgical
setting, since replantation surgery is far too sophisticated
and time-consuming under these conditions [12].
Our hypothetical treatment approach for this obvious
military medical challenge is outlined in this paper. Re￾cently, there has been growing evidence for the successful
application of ex vivo perfusion in solid organ transplant￾ation [13–17]. Figure 1 shows the basic scheme of a ma￾chine perfusion system. For example, ex vivo heart and
lung perfusion can be applied for up to 8 and 12 h, re￾spectively, in the clinical setting, and result in significantly
better outcomes after transplantation compared to the
gold standard of static cold organ preservation [14, 15].
Furthermore, the first large randomized clinical trial in
liver transplantation was recently published and supports
the aforementioned benefits of ex vivo organ perfusion
[16]. In addition to the reduction of the cold ischemic
time, ex vivo organ perfusion systems can be used for ex￾tended criteria donor organs due to an improvement of
graft function during machine perfusion. Individualized
organ therapy is possible following the reevaluation of the
organ [17]. It can be assumed that ex vivo organ perfu￾sion is able to relieve the donor organ shortage.
Ex vivo limb perfusion (EVLP) has also gained interest
in recent years, although the evidence on EVLP is still
scarce. In 2011, Constantinescu et al. showed the
Fig. 1 Basic schematic of a machine perfusion system*. *Figure by Krezdorn N, Tasigiorgos S, Wo L, Turk M, Lopdruo R, Kiwanuka H, et al. Tissue

feasibility of a porcine model by perfusing swine limbs
for up to 12 h with autologous blood [18]. The same
group later allotransplanted a small series after 12 h of
ex vivo perfusion and showed promising results regard￾ing reperfusion injury and muscle contractility. More￾over, it could be shown that muscle contractility
returned to nearly normal [19]. A Boston group analyzed
seven forelimbs of pigs and divided these into two co￾horts of cold perfusion compared to cold storage for 12
h [20]. In 2016, Ozer and colleagues subsequently in￾creased the perfusion period to 24 h in a porcine model
of eight limbs and applied normothermic perfusion with
autologous blood [21]. However, a recent review of the
current literature on this topic concluded that there is
no standard protocol for EVLP, and it cannot be clearly
stated whether the used perfusion solutions are optimal
for experimental or clinical vascularized composite tis￾sue allotransplantation (VCA) [22]. Additionally, in
2017, Werner and colleagues from the University of
Michigan reported the ex situ perfusion of five human
limb allografts from deceased heart-beating donors,
which was feasible for up to 24 h with only small signs
of tissue deterioration [23]. In summary, the limitations of
the current literature are that there is no standardized per￾fusion protocol, and there are no data available indicating
the effects of different perfusion solutions and tempera￾tures, the various involved cell types (e.g., endothelial cells,
nerve cells), or graft viability and functionality. Further￾more, a common problem in the aforementioned studies
was weight gain during perfusion due to edema, but there
are currently no data available about the impact of weight
gain on subsequent replantation or transplantation,
especially in humans. A selection of studies on ex vivo tis￾sue perfusion is summarized in Table 1. Of note, all stud￾ies had perfusion times of no more than 24 h. In the
military setting, the necessity for longer perfusion periods
is highly likely due to strategic evacuations to Role 4 facil￾ities. In our experience from the Afghanistan missions, the
average time between damage control surgery in the Role
3 facility and strategic evacuation to the Role 4 facility in
Germany was 48–72 h.
Presentation of the hypothesis
The current lack of replantation possibilities in military
operations with high rates of amputation could be ad￾dressed with the development of a portable, clinically ap￾plicable EVLP device. There are several opportunities
present with the introduction of EVLP on the horizon.
Critical ischemic time
First, EVLP is able to notably prolong the ischemic
periods. After recovering the amputated limb, it can
be conserved in the perfusion device under physio￾logical conditions until the damage control surgery
has been performed and the patient stabilized. Cur￾rently, the “life before limb” approach is unquestion￾ably feasible and even recommended. Therefore,
EVLP is associated with higher tactical and strategic
flexibility. Strategic aeromedical evacuation can be
planned and executed cautiously without the pressure
of time, and definitive care in a Role 4 facility can be
carefully planned.

Surgical opportunities
Before replantation, there is enough time for rigorous
debridement of both the stump and the amputated limb
to facilitate the successful re-adaptation of all the im￾portant anatomical structures. Further EVLP would
allow for spare-part surgery of the perfused limb, even
in cases of severe limb damage. As an example, in select
cases, functional ankle joints could be used for knee
joint replacement (van Nees procedure), or atypical
osteomyocutaneous free flaps could be harvested from
mangled perfused extremities.
Microbiological considerations
Combat-related injuries have been shown to be at great
risk for contamination, especially with multi-resistant
pathogens [25]. The reasons for the high incidence of in￾fections with multi-resistant bacteria in combat wounds
have yet to be satisfyingly identified [25]. Moreover, soil
organisms and the amount of exposure to dirt during in￾jury and tactical evacuation characterize the combat￾related wound. EVLP enables the administration of high
doses of antibiotic and antifungal medications without
the constraints of systemic application [17]. Thus, these
doses can be much higher than the regularly adminis￾tered doses and can significantly decrease the risk of
post-operative infections.
Ischemia and reperfusion-related injuries
Ischemia and reperfusion-related injuries (IRI) threaten
not only the replanted limb, but due to a sterile systemic
inflammation, also the patient’s life [26]. Ischemia leads
to metabolic changes in the affected tissue, depending
on the ischemic period, basically due to the shift from
aerobic to anaerobic energy production. With reperfu￾sion of the ischemic tissue, an immunological reaction
concomitant with cell apoptosis and necrosis is ob￾served. It has already been shown that the expression of
hypoxia-related genes is less activated during ex vivo
perfusion compared to static cold storage [24]. Thus, the
reduction of IRI is a logical consequence of EVLP. Fur￾thermore, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
measures can be applied during ex vivo perfusion. A
good example for this pharmacological approach is the
addition of prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors,
which have recently been shown to attenuate IRI in ex￾perimental models [27].
Assessment of tissue function.
Another great opportunity is the possibility to assess tis￾sue function and vitality during EVLP. From experiences
with normothermic machine perfusion for subsequent
transplantation of the liver, it is already known that re￾peated evaluation of graft function and metabolism leads
to higher rate of successful transplantation procedures
[17]. It is possible that the tissue of amputated limbs
could be reconditioned during EVLP, for example by the
application of optimal oxygen levels and supplementa￾tion of nutrition.
Transplantation and Immunoconditioning
VCA is a further treatment option for cases in which re￾plantation is not feasible (e.g., due to severe loss of tissue
or a mangled extremity). However, the widespread appli￾cation of VCA has not yet been realized. It requires life￾long immunosuppression, which is associated with re￾percussions such as an increased risk of malignancy oc￾currence or renal failure [28, 29]. Recent data show
promising results regarding the knockdown of major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [30, 31].
This approach might be able to reduce the amount of
post-transplant immunosuppression, as well as the early
allograft rejection risk. Furthermore, a study that applied
ex vivo perfusion in a VCA rat model showed a signifi￾cant reduction of MHC I expression by at least 50% in
all tissue compartments [30]. It was also found that
knockdown prolonged rejection-free survival by 60%
[30]. Comparable results have recently been reported in
solid organ transplantation research [31].
Hypothetical application
Figure 2 shows the hypothetical application of EVLP in a
fictive patient with combat-related limb loss and subse￾quent evacuation and treatment. After infliction of the
injury, the patient is tactically evacuated to a Role 2 or
Role 3 facility for damage control surgery. The ampu￾tated limb is preserved in static cold storage for tactical
evacuation. The initial surgical treatment can completely
focus on stabilizing the patient while the limb is con￾nected to the ex vivo perfusion device and perfusion is
started. Planning and execution of a strategic aero￾medical evacuation to a Role 4 facility can be done with￾out time pressure regarding limb ischemia time
requirements. After admission to the Role 4 facility, a
specialist microsurgical team can prepare the patient, as
well as the limb, and then perform replantation surgery
under highly elective conditions.
Proposed methodology
In terms of the actual in-field application of such a de￾vice, an algorithm would be as follows: After tourniquet
treatment of the proximal stump of the severed limb,
the amputated limb would be cleaned with disinfectants,
rinsed with sodium chloride and sterilely placed on the
perfusion device’s tray. Blunt dissection of the distal
stump allows demonstration of the main vessels, which
most military surgeons are familiar with for shunting
procedures. A single use cannulation kit will be used to
cannulate the arterial vessel and will be tied with either
Kaltenborn et al. Military Medical Research (2020) 7:21 Page 4 of 8

a suture or a snug clamp. The cannula will then be ster￾ilely connected to the perfusion device, with free venous
outflow. Hypothermic perfusion with off-the-shelf acel￾lular perfusion solutions such as Perfadex or Steen will
be initiated. For the trained person, the entire procedure
will take approximately 15 min.
Testing the hypothesis
First, the optimal conditions for long-term EVLP need
to be found. Studies on the metabolic condition under
perfusion in regard to cell damage and reactions of dif￾ferent additives to the perfusion solution should en￾lighten this aspect. The influence of different perfusion
solutions on all affected tissues needs to be investigated,
as well as the addition of medications (e.g., antibiotics or
corticosteroids), nutrition, and electrolytes. Furthermore,
the optimal oxygen saturation and temperature must be
defined.
As mentioned above, there are data available from
in vivo studies in porcine models, although the results
are limited by the short perfusion time of 24 h. In the
military setting, notably longer perfusion times need to
be addressed. Therefore, future animal studies must
focus especially on long-term perfusion, since this repre￾sents the military setting, considering the time for
stabilization of the patient until evacuation to a tertiary
treatment center. It is of utmost importance to allow the
shift from a katabolic to an anabolic state of metabolism
in the amputated limb.
Restoring the functionality of the replanted limb
should be a major aim for future research. In our opin￾ion, the identification and improvement of all relevant
factors for nerve regeneration are the key for successful
aftercare. Nerves are especially prone to ischemia￾induced damage which would occur within a timeframe
of 2 h. Modern day VCA results impressively show that
functionality can be excellent when the procedure is well
prepared and performed under optimal conditions [13].
Systematic translational and multidisciplinary research
projects should focus on axonal growth, nerve guidance
structures and microsurgical nerve reconstruction.
Promising data are available from two interesting devel￾opments in the field of nerve regeneration. The applica￾tion of spider silk as a guiding structure for nerve
regeneration is an upcoming innovation. Making use of
spider silk is an idea dating back thousands of years [32].
For example, it is known that cobwebs were used to stop
bleeding in ancient Rome, and natives of the Salomon
Islands have been using spider silk-woven fishing lines
for the last 300 years to catch small fish from their boats
[33, 34]. There is strong evidence from a long-distance
peripheral nerve gap model that spider silk enhances
Schwann cell migration, axonal regrowth and remyelina￾tion, including electrophysiological recovery resulting in
functional recovery (see Fig. 3) [35]. The growth of hu￾man neurons on spider silk has been established and
there has actually been active neural cell migration and
adhesion of neuronal cells to spider silk fibers [36].
Therefore, it needs to be investigated whether the early
Fig. 2 Hypothetical application in a fictive patient with combat-related limb loss and subsequent evacuation and treatment (EVLP: ex vivo
limb perfusion)
Kaltenborn et al. Military Medical Research (2020) 7:21 Page 5 of 8

coupling of nerve ends to spider silk guiding structures
during EVLP can lead to an increased rate of axonal
growth after replantation and allotransplantation.
Additionally, EVLP provides the opportunity to
apply another innovative approach. Current research
is focused on the application of the biological poly￾saccharide chitosan and chitosan-coated nerve con￾duits. For short defects, chitosan-coated nerve
conduits have already been approved for clinical ap￾plications, and preoperative nerve protection with
such a conduit might lead to better results in the
long run. Schwann cells grow exceptionally well on
chitosan-coated surfaces, and co-cultivated neurons
show increased neurite development [37]. There is
further evidence that monocytes from peripheral
blood have an increased expression of M2 phenotypes
when in contact with chitosan [38]. Taken together,
these factors might improve nerve regeneration and
could lead to better functional outcomes.
The already available data should be complemented
with analyses of longer periods of time. The profiles in￾cluding the expression of hypoxia-induced genes, the cyto￾kines and the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
factors at molecular level would help elucidate the effects
further. One focus might be the evaluation of pharma￾cological approaches, such as the addition of PHD in￾hibitors [27]. The already available and promising
results regarding MHC silencing should be researched
in depth, especially regarding the major implications
for its application in VCA.
A clinically applicable prototype needs to be developed
in close cooperation with medical engineers and perfu￾sion specialists. There has already been experience with
solid organ machine perfusion and extracorporeal mem￾brane oxygenation, which could be very useful during
the prototype development phase. The EVLP device
needs to address several specifications to allow its appli￾cation in the military setting. It needs to be easy to use
in stressful situations, unaffected by severe climate con￾ditions and easy to transport, especially via air transport.
Thus, the prototype must be intensively tested in the
field to allow reliable clinical use. Such a device could
also be a breakthrough for the field of VCA.
Implications of the hypothesis
The development and clinical introduction of EVLP can
address two challenges of modern medicine. First, there
is a huge demand for VCA in civilian medicine. Such a
device could be a breakthrough, by allowing a reasonable
timeframe to organize a transplant procedure, including
patient selection, graft allocation and technical and sur￾gical preparation. Moreover, due to different trauma
mechanisms in the civilian setting with less soft tissue
damage than in combat injuries, the chance of successful
replantation surgery is, per se, more likely. The Injury
Severity Score, which is a practical tool for depicting the
overall trauma burden, is significantly lower in civilian
traumatic amputations [39]. First and foremost, we be￾lieve that this is the most relevant improvement for civil￾ian medicine associated with EVLP. Second, EVLP might
have a relevant impact on military medicine due to the
outlined hypothetical implication in extremity salvage
after traumatic amputation, although the rate of salvage￾able extremities is surely lower than that in civilian
trauma due the different trauma mechanisms. Neverthe￾less, there is a notable number of wounded soldiers who
could benefit from the application of EVLP, either in the
acute setting of traumatic amputation or during delayed
reconstruction with VCA. Injury patterns in the combat
setting are associated with a high degree of soft tissue
trauma and a significant loss of tissue. In these cases,
VCA is a valuable treatment option, and the widespread
availability of VCA programs could be possible on the

basis of EVLP. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown
that chronic pain and the failure of motor neuron regen￾eration lead to delayed amputations in patients with
combat injuries [40]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized
that the introduction of EVLP in the military setting
could lead to a drastic reduction in the number of ser￾vice members disabled by amputation. There is strong
evidence that both civilians and military personnel will
have improved outcomes regarding psychosocial factors
and functionality after replantation surgery when com￾pared to limb salvage or prosthetic treatment.
The availability of a trained microsurgical team that
can carry out a sophisticated replantation procedure is
unlikely in most kinds of military operations. EVLP en￾ables replantation surgery in a Role 4 facility in the
home country and changes the clinical setting from a
highly urgent, life-threatening situation to a highly meth￾odical, well-prepared starting point for optimal treat￾ment of the wounded service member.
In conclusion, with the introduction of EVLP, the
principle of “life before limb” will change to “life before
limb before elective replantation or transplantation after
EVLP”, from which both military and civilian societies
will benefit.
