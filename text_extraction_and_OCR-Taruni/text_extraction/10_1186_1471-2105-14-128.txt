Abstract
Background: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially
expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new
knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as
input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries.
While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for
improvement.
Results: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new
gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches
to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be
embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by
comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a
common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in
many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when
compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences
between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.
Conclusions: Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis web-based tool providing various types of
visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists. Enrichr is open source and freely available online at:

Background
Recent improvements in our ability to perform genome￾wide profiling of DNA, RNA, and protein at lower costs
and more accurately further highlight the need for devel￾oping tools that can convert such an abundance of data
into useful biological, biomedical, and pharmacological
knowledge. One of the most powerful methods for ana￾lyzing such massive datasets is summarizing the results
as lists of differentially expressed genes and then query￾ing such gene lists against prior knowledge gene-set li￾braries [1,2]. Differentially expressed gene lists can be
extracted from RNA-seq or microarray studies; gene lists
can be created from genes harboring mutations in co￾horts of patients, or gene lists can be putative targets of
transcription factors or histone modifications profiled by
ChIP-seq. In fact, gene lists can be produced from any
relevant experimental method that profiles the entire
genome or the proteome. Once unbiased lists of genes
or proteins are generated from such experiments, these
lists are used as input for computing enrichment with
existing lists created from prior knowledge organized
into gene-set libraries.
Gene-set libraries are used to organize accumulated
knowledge about the function of groups of genes. Each
gene-set library is made of a set of related gene lists
where each set of genes is associated with a functional
term such as a pathway name or a transcription factor
that regulates the genes. Creating such gene-set libraries
can be achieved by assembling gene sets from diverse

contexts. The original method that developed this ap￾proach is called gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA),
first used to analyze microarray data collected from
muscle biopsies of diabetic patients [3]. The authors of
this seminal publication developed a statistical test that
is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [4] as well as
developed a database of gene-set libraries called MSigDB
[5]. Many other gene set enrichment analysis tools have
been developed in recent years following the original
concept [1]. However, many of such enrichment analysis
tools focus on performing enrichment using only the
Gene Ontology resource [6]. In addition, enrichment
analysis tools most commonly use the Fisher exact test
or similar variations of it to compute enrichment [7].
This family of tests has some bias to list size. Besides com￾puting enrichment for input lists of genes, gene-set librar￾ies can be used to build functional association networks
[8,9], predict novel functions for genes, and discover dis￾tal relationships between biological and pharmacological
processes. While many gene-set libraries and tools for
performing enrichment analysis already exist, there is a
growing need for them and there are more ways to im￾prove and validate gene set enrichment methods. For in￾stance, many useful novel gene set libraries can be
created; the performance of the enrichment computation
can be improved; and visualization of enrichment results
can be done in more intuitive and interactive ways.
Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based
and mobile software application that includes many new
gene-set libraries, a new approach to rank enriched
terms, and powerful interactive visualizations of the re￾sults in new ways. Enrichr is delivered as an HTML5
web-based application and also as a mobile app for the
iPhone, Android and Blackberry. Users are provided
with the ability to share the results with collaborators
and export vector graphic figures that display the enrich￾ment results in a publication ready format. We evaluated
the ability of Enrichr to rank terms from gene-set librar￾ies by comparing the Fisher exact test to a method we
developed which computes the deviation from the
expected rank for terms. To evaluate various methods
that rank enriched terms, we analyzed lists of differen￾tially expressed genes from studies that measured gene
expression after knockdown of transcription factors to
see the ranking of the knocked down factors using a
transcription-factor/target-gene library [10]. We show
that the deviation from the expected rank method ranks
more relevant terms higher. We also applied Enrichr to
analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrich￾ment signature patterns to the enrichment signatures of
matched normal tissues. Such analysis provides a global
visualization of critical regulatory differences between
normal tissues and cancer cell lines. In particular, we ob￾served a common pattern of up regulation of the PRC2
polycomb group target genes and enrichment for the
histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines. The
global view of enrichment signature patterns also clearly
unravels that Toll-like receptor signaling is turned off in
K562 cells when compared to normal CD33+ myeloid
cells, whereas interleukin signaling stays intact in both cell
types. Overall, Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrich￾ment analysis web-based tool providing various types of
visualization summaries of collective functions of gene
lists.
Implementation
Creating the gene-set libraries
Enrichr contains 35 gene-set libraries where some libraries
are borrowed from other tools while many other libraries
are newly created and only available in Enrichr. The gene￾set libraries provided by Enrichr are divided into six
categories: transcription, pathways, ontologies, diseases/
drugs, cell types and miscellaneous. The following is a de￾scription of each library and how it was created:
The transcription category provides six gene-set librar￾ies that attempt to link differentially expressed genes
with the transcriptional machinery. These six libraries
include the ability to identify transcription factors that
are enriched for target genes within the input list using
four different options: 1) ChEA [10]; 2) position weight
matrices (PWMs) from TRANSFAC [11] and JASPAR
[12]; 3) target genes generated from PMWs downloaded
from the UCSC genome browser [13]; and 4) transcrip￾tion factor targets extracted from the ENCODE project
[14,15]. In addition, the two other gene-set libraries in
the transcription category are gene sets associated with:
5) histone modifications extracted from the Roadmap
Epigenomics Project [16]; and 6) microRNAs targets
computationally predicted by TargetScan [17].
1. The ChIP-x Enrichment Analysis (ChEA) database
[10] is our own resource for storing putative targets for
transcription factors extracted from publications that
report experiments of profiling transcription factors
binding to DNA in mammalian cells. The database is
already formatted into a gene-set library where the
functional terms are the transcription factors profiled
in each study together with the PubMed identifier
(PMID) of the paper used to extract the gene. The
ChEA gene-set library used in Enrichr is an updated
version from the originally published database
containing more than twice the entries compared to
the originally published version [10].
2. PWMs from TRANSFAC and JASPAR were used to
scan the promoters of all human genes in the region
−2000 and +500 from the transcription factor start
site (TSS). We retained only the 100% matches to
the consensus sequences to call an interaction
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:128 Page 2 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/128

between a factor and target gene. This gene-set
library was created for a tool we previously
published called Expression2Kinases [18].
3. Transcription factor target genes inferred from
PWMs for the human genome were downloaded
from the UCSC Genome Browser [13] FTP site
which contains many resources for gene and
sequence annotations. We converted this file into a
gene set library and included it in Enrichr since it
produces different results compared with the other
method to identify transcription factor/target
interactions from PWMs as described above.
4. The ENCODE transcription factor gene-set library is
the fourth method to create a transcription factor/
target gene set library. We processed the newly
published data from the Encyclopedia of DNA
Elements (ENCODE) project [14,15]. Using the
aligned files for all 646 experiments that profiled
transcription factors in mammalian cells, we
identified the peaks using the MACS software [19]
and then identified the genes targeted by the factors
using our own custom processing. We sorted the
peaks for each experiment by distance to the
transcription factor start site (TSS) and retained the
top 2000 target genes for each experiment.
5. The Histone modification gene-set library was
created by processing experiments from the NIH
Roadmap Epigenomics [20]. Such experiments were
conducted using various types of human cell lines
types with antibodies targeting over 30 different
histone modification marks. ChIP-seq datasets from
the Roadmap Epigenomics project deposited to the
GEO database were analyzed and converted to gene
sets with the use of the software, SICER [21].
Previous studies [22] have indicated that the use of
control sample substantially reduces DNA shearing
biases and sequencing artifacts; therefore, for each
experiment, an input control sample was matched
according to the description in GEO. ChIP-seq
experiments without matched control input were
not included. The resulting gene-set library contains
27 types of histone modifications for 64 human cell
lines from various tissue origins.
6. The microRNA gene set library was created by
processing data from the TargetScan online database
[23] and was borrowed from our previous
publication, Lists2Networks [24].
The pathways category includes gene-set libraries from
well-known pathway databases such as WikiPathways
[25], KEGG [26], BioCarta, and Reactome [27] as well as
five gene-set libraries we created from our own resources:
kinase enrichment analysis (KEA) [28] for kinases and
their known substrates, protein-protein interaction hubs
[18], CORUM [29], and complexes from a recent high￾throughput IP-MS study [30] as well as a manually assem￾bled gene-set library created from extracting lists of
phosphoproteins from SILAC phosphoproteomics publi￾cations [31].
1-4. The pathway associated gene-set libraries were
created from each of the above databases by
converting members of each pathway from each
pathway database to a list of human genes.
5. The Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) gene-set
library contains human or mouse kinases and their
known substrates collected from literature reports as
provided by six kinase-substrate databases: HPRD
[32], PhosphoSite [33], PhosphoPoint [34], Phospho.
Elm [35], NetworKIN [36], and MINT [37].
6. The protein-protein interaction hubs gene-set
library is made from an updated version of a human
protein-protein interaction network that we are
continually updating and originally published as part
of the program, Expression2Kinases [18]. From this
network, we extracted the proteins with 120 or
more interactions. These proteins are the terms in
the library whereas their direct protein interactors
are the genes in each gene set.
7–8. The next two gene-set libraries in the pathway
category are protein complexes. The first library
was created from a recent study that profiled
nuclear complexes in human breast cancer cell
lines after applying over 3000 immuno￾precipitations followed by mass-spectrometry
(IP-MS) experiments using over 1000 different
antibodies [30]. The second complexes gene-set
library was created from the mammalian complexes
database, CORUM [29].
9. The SILAC phosphoproteomics gene set library was
created by processing tables from the supporting
materials of SILAC phosphoproteomics studies. From
each supporting table, we extracted lists of up and
down proteins without applying any cutoffs. Protein
IDs were converted to mammalian gene IDs when
necessary using online gene symbol conversion tools.
A total of 84 gene lists were extracted from such
studies.
The ontology category contains gene-set libraries cre￾ated from the three gene ontology trees [6] and from the
knockout mouse phenotypes ontology developed by the
Jackson Lab from their MGI-MP browser [38]. To create
such gene-set libraries, we “cut” the tree at either the third
or fourth level and created a gene set from the terms and
their associated genes downstream of the cut. The details
about creating the Gene Ontology gene-set libraries are
provided in our previous publication, Lists2Networks [24].
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:128 Page 3 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/128

The disease/drugs category has gene set libraries
created from the Connectivity Map database [39],
GeneSigDB [40], MSigDB [5], OMIM [41], and
VirusMINT [42].
1–2. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [39]
contains over 6,000 Affymetrix microarray gene
expression experiments where human cancer cell
lines were treated with over 1,300 drugs, many of
them FDA approved, and changes in expression
where measured after six hours. The drugs were
always used as a single treatment but varied in
concentrations. The CMAP database provides the
results in a table where genes are listed in rank
order based on their level of differential expression
compared to the untreated state. From this table,
we extracted the top 100 and bottom 100
differentially expressed genes to create two gene-set
libraries, one for the up genes and one for the
down genes for each condition. Each set is
associated with a drug name and the four digit
experiment number from CMAP. This four digit
number can be used to locate the concentration,
cell-type, and batch.
3. The GeneSigDB gene-set library was borrowed from
the GeneSigDB database [40]. The database contains
gene lists extracted manually from the supporting
tables of thousands of publications; most are from
cancer related studies.
4–5. The OMIM gene-set library was created directly
from the NCBI’s OMIM Morbid Map [41]. We
removed diseases with only a few genes and
merged diseases with similar names because these
are likely made of few subtypes of the same
disease. In addition, since most diseases have only
few genes, we used our tool, Genes2Networks [43],
to create the OMIM expanded gene-set library. We
entered the disease genes as the seed list and
expanded the list by identifying proteins that
directly interact with at least two of the disease
gene products; in other words, we searched for
paths that connect two disease gene products with
one intermediate protein, resulting in a sub￾network that connects the disease genes with
additional proteins/genes. Each sub-network for
each disease was converted to a gene set.
6. The VirusMINT gene-set library was created from
the VirusMINT database [42], which is made of
literature extracted protein-protein interactions
between viral proteins and human proteins. Each
term in the library represents a virus wherein the
genes/proteins in each set are the host proteins that
are known to directly interact with all the viral
proteins for each virus.
7–8.The MSigDB computational and MSigDB
oncogenic signature gene-set libraries were
borrowed from the MSigDB database from
categories C4 and C6 [5]. These gene-set libraries
contain modules of genes differentially expressed in
various cancers.
The cell type category is made of four gene-set librar￾ies: genes highly expressed in human and mouse tissues
extracted from the Mouse and Human Gene Atlases [44]
and genes highly expressed in cancer cell lines from the
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) [45] and NCI-60
[46]. The gene-set libraries in this category were all cre￾ated similarly. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) dataset was derived from the gene-centric RMA￾normalized mRNA expression data from the CCLE site.
The Human Gene Atlas and Mouse Gene Atlas datasets
were derived from averaged GCRMA-normalized mRNA
expression data from the BioGPS site. Finally, the Human
NCI60 Cell Lines dataset, while also downloaded from
the BioGPS site, was raw and not normalized; hence, it
was normalized using quantile normalization. The
downloaded datasets were all of similar format such that
the raw data was in a table with the rows being the genes
and the columns being the expression values in the differ￾ent cells. For each gene, the average and standard devi￾ation of the expression values across all samples were
computed. For each gene/term data point, a z-score was
calculated based on the row’s average and standard devi￾ation. Duplicate gene probes were merged by selecting the
highest absolute z-score. Only genes with an absolute
z-score of greater than 3 were selected to be part of a gene
set for a particular cell which represents the term.
The miscellaneous category has three gene-set librar￾ies: chromosome location, metabolites, and structural
domains. The chromosomal location library is made of
human genes belonging to chromosomal segments of
the human genome. It is derived from MSigDB [5]. The
metabolite library was created from HMDB, a database
[47] enlisting metabolites and the genes associated with
them. Finally, the structural domains library was created
from the PFAM [48] and InterPro [49] databases where
the terms are structural domains and the genes/proteins
are the genes containing the domains.
Computing enrichment
Enrichr implements three approaches to compute
enrichment. The first one is a standard method
implemented within most enrichment analysis tools: the
Fisher exact test. This is a proportion test that assumes
a binomial distribution and independence for probability
of any gene belonging to any set. The second test is a
correction to the Fisher exact test that we developed
based on intuition. We first compute enrichment using
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:128 Page 4 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/128

the Fisher exact test for many random input gene lists in
order to compute a mean rank and standard deviation
from the expected rank for each term in each gene-set
library. Then, using a lookup table of expected ranks
with their variances, we compute a z-score for deviation
from this expected rank, this can be a new corrected
score for ranking terms. Alternatively, we combined the
p-value computed using the Fisher exact test with the
z-score of the deviation from the expected rank by
multiplying these two numbers as follows:
c ¼ logð Þ p :z ð1Þ
Where c is the combined score, p is the p-value com￾puted using the Fisher exact test, and z is the z-score
computed by assessing the deviation from the expected
rank. Enrichr provides all three options for sorting
enriched terms. In the results section, we show how we
evaluated the quality of each of these three enrichment
methods by examining how the methods rank terms that
we know should be highly ranked.
Visualization of the results on a grid
Enrichr provides various ways to visualize the results
from the enrichment analysis. One such method is the
visualization of the enriched terms on a grid of squares.
Here, all terms from a gene-set library are represented
by squares on a grid which is organized based on the
terms’ gene content similarity where an area of high
similarity is made brighter. To arrange terms on the
grid, term-term similarity is first computed using our al￾gorithm, Sets2Networks [9]. For this, the gene-set library
is transposed making each gene the set label and the
terms the sets for each gene. Sets2Networks then com￾putes the probability for term-term similarity based on a
co-occurrence probabilistic calculation. Once an adja￾cency distance matrix is computed for similarity between
all pairs of terms, a simulated annealing process is used
to arrange all terms on the dimension-less torodial grid.
Dimension-less torodial grid means that the edges of the
grid are continuous and connected, forming a torus. The
simulated annealing process attempts to maximize the
global similarity of terms based on their computed simi￾larity distances as determined by Sets2Networks. The
annealing starts with a random arrangement of terms,
and then, using the Boltzman distribution, we swap the
location of pairs of terms randomly and compute the
global fitness of the swap. We run such annealing
process until the arrangement converges to a fitness
maximum. Once enrichment analysis is computed, the
enriched terms are highlighted with higher p-values indi￾cated by a brighter square. The grid can be clicked to
toggle between the two alternative views: The alternative
view shows all terms on the grid where the enriched
terms are highlighted with circles, colored from bright
white to gray based on their p-values.
Computing the significance of clustering of terms on
the grid
Once enrichment analysis on the grid is achieved, we
compute an index that distinguishes between randomly
distributed enriched terms on the grid and terms that
significantly cluster. While the continuous case of com￾puting such clustering has a foundation in the literature
[50,51], the discrete nature of the grids of terms used in
Enrichr has an appreciable effect that makes the computa￾tion with the continuous assumption inaccurate. Hence,
we implemented a numerical approach to compute such a
clustering index with associated probabilities.
Visualization of the results as a network of terms
Another alternative visualization of the results is to dis￾play the enriched terms as a network where the nodes
represent the enriched terms and the links represent the
gene content similarity among the enriched terms. To
make sure the network is sufficiently sparse to avoid
clutter and ambiguity, we connected each of the top ten
enriched terms to the only other closest enriched term
based on gene content similarity. To visualize the net￾work, we slightly modified the force-directed graph
example that is a part of the JavaScript library, Data
Driven Documents (D3) [52].
Implementation of the web and mobile applications
Enrichr has two parts: a back end and a front end. The
back end is comprised of a Microsoft IIS 6 web server
and Apache Tomcat 7 as the Java application server. The
back end uses Java servlets to respond to the submis￾sions of gene lists or for processing other data requests
from the front end. Apache Maven is used to compile,
minify, and aggregate the JavaScript and CSS files for
faster web load times, package, and deploy the web app
onto the Tomcat server. Conversely, the front end is
written primarily in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSP.
Enrichr has a user friendly and responsive interface, using
AJAX calls to serve JSON response data from the servlet
asynchronously for a smoother user experience. The bar
graphs, grids, term networks, and color pickers are dy￾namically generated using the SVG JavaScript library, D3
[52]. The page transitions, sortable tables, hovering over
text functions, touch gestures, and other page manipula￾tions are powered by the jQuery JavaScript library. A
shared servlet that is used in other projects is used to con￾vert URL-encoded base64 text that represents the SVG
figures into downloadable SVG, PNG, or JPG files using
the Batik SVG Toolkit from the Apache XML Graphics
Project. Enrichr can also be accessed via Android, iOS,
and BlackBerry phone apps. All of the phone apps share
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:128 Page 5 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/128

the mobile framework, Apache Cordova, which allows for
the development of cross-platform mobile apps using
HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS ensuring that there is no fea￾ture decay across the different mobile platforms as well as
desktop web platforms. Slight adjustments in Java, Object￾ive C, and JavaScript for Android, iOS, and BlackBerry
respectively were necessary to ensure that Enrichr was
functional and consistent across these platforms.
Adding Enrichr as a final step to RNA-seq pipelines
Enrichr's online help contains a Python script that takes as
input the output from CuffDiff which is a part of CuffLinks
[53]. CuffDiff is a common last step in the analysis of
RNA-seq data which finds differentially expressed genes
for various comparisons of RNA-seq data. However, the
output from CuffDiff is not easy to handle. The python
script extracts all the up and down gene lists from the in￾put file, and then using the Python library, Poster, gener￾ates links to Enrichr analyses.
Results and discussion
The user interface
The user interface of Enrichr starts with a form that en￾ables users to either upload a file containing a list of genes
or paste in a list of genes into a text area (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). An example is provided to show users the cor￾rect format for gene symbols and to enable demo analysis
if a gene list is not readily available. Users can optionally
enter a brief description of their list, which is useful if they
choose to share the analysis with collaborators. After sub￾mitting the list for analysis, the user is presented with the
results page, which is divided into the six different categor￾ies: transcription, pathways, ontologies, disease/drugs, cell
types, and miscellaneous. Clicking on the name of the
gene-set library expands a box that reveals the enrichment
analysis results for that gene-set library. Users are first
presented with a bar graph that shows the top 10 enriched
terms for the selected gene-set library (Figure 1 and
Additional file 2: Figure S2). The bar graph provides a vis￾ual representation of how significant each term is based
on the overlap with the user’s input list. The longer bars
and lighter colored bars mean that the term is more sig￾nificant. It is possible to export the bar graph as a figure
for publication or other form of presentation into three
formats: JPEG, SVG and PNG. In addition, the color of
the bar graph can be customized using a hexagonal color
selection wheel populated with colors that provide the
best contrast. There are three methods to compute enrich￾ment and the user can toggle between them by clicking on
any bar of the bar graph: Fisher exact test based ranking,
rank based ranking, and combined score ranking.
To view the results in a tabular format, the user can
switch to the table view tab. The results are presented
in an HTML sortable table with various columns show￾ing the enriched terms with the various scores (Figure 1
and Additional file 3: Figure S3). Clicking on the
headers allows the user to sort the different columns
and a search box is also available if interested in find￾ing the scores for a particular term. Furthermore, the
user can export the table to a tab-delimited formatted
file that can be opened with software tools such as
Excel or any text editor. Within these files, the users

can see all terms, their scores, and the overlapping
genes with the input genes for each term. The overlap￾ping genes can be seen also by mouse hovering the
terms in the table. For most tables, the enriched terms
are hyperlinked to external sources that provide more
information about the term.
Enrichr also provides a unique visualization of the re￾sults on a grid of terms (Figure 1 and Additional file 4:
Figure S4). On each grid spot, the terms from a gene-set
library are arranged based on their gene content simi￾larity. The enriched terms are highlighted on the grid
and color coded based on their level of enrichment,
where brighter spots signify more enrichment. Enrichr
also provides a measure of clustering of the enriched
terms on the grid. The clustering level z-scores and p￾values are highlighted in red if the clustering is signifi￾cant (p-value < 0.1) or displayed in gray if the clustering
is not significant. This clustering indicator provides an
additional assessment of how related the genes are to
each other and how relevant the specific gene-set librar￾ies are for the input list of genes. The observation of
one or two clusters on the grid suggests that a gene-set
library is relevant to the input list. It also indicates that
the terms in the clusters are relevant to the input list.
Similar to the bar graph tab, the grid can be customized
with the color wheel and exported into the three image
formats. Clicking on any spot on the grid toggles be￾tween a p-value view and a grid view. The p-value view
only highlights the enriched terms leaving all other
spots black, while the grid view shows the similarity be￾tween terms as bright spots and the enriched terms as
circles on top of the grid.
The final visualization option is a network view of the
enriched terms (Figure 1 and Additional file 5: Figure
S5). The network connects terms that are close to each
other on the grid, giving a sense of how the enriched
terms are related to each other. The nodes of the network
are the enriched terms and they are arranged using a
force-based layout. Users have the option to refine this
arrangment by dragging the nodes to a desired place.
These networks can also be color customized interactively
and exported into one of the three image formats.
Enrichr makes it simple to share the analysis results with
others. Users can click on the share icon to the right of the
description box, resulting in a popup that provides the user
with a link to the analysis results that they can copy and
paste into an e-mail to send to a collaborator. Users can
also create a user account where they can store and
organize all their uploaded lists in one place. The user ac￾count will enable users to contribute their lists to the com￾munity generetaed gene-set library. This will allow other
users to query their input lists against user contributed lists.
Enrichr also provides a mechanism to search for func￾tions for specific genes with an auto-complete
functionality. The results from the gene function search
show all the terms for the gene from all gene-set librar￾ies (Additional file 6: Figure S6). Enrichr is also mobile￾friendly such that it supports touch gestures; for ex￾ample, a simple swipe left and right on the main page
switches between the tabs. On the results page, at the
top level with no specific enrichment type selected,
swipes left and right will navigate between the different
enrichment categories. Once the user selects an enrich￾ment type, swipes left and right will navigate between
the different visualization types for the current enrich￾ment type.
Statistics of the gene set libraries
Enrichr includes 35 gene-set libraries totaling 31,026
gene-sets that completely cover the human and mouse
genome and proteome (Table 1). On average, each gene￾set has ~350 genes and there are over six million connec￾tions between terms and genes. Further statistics and
information of where the gene-set libraries were derived
from can be found in the “Dataset Statistics” tab of the
Enrichr main page. Histograms of gene frequencies for
most gene-set libraries follow a power law, suggesting that
some genes are much more common in gene-set libraries
than others (Figure 2a). This has an implication for enrich￾ment computations that we did not consider yet in
Enrichr. Some genes are more likely to appear in various
enrichment analyses more than others, this tendency can
stem from various sources including well-studied genes.
This research focus bias is in several of the libraries.
Evaluation of the enrichment scoring methods
Enrichr computes three types of enrichment scores to
assess the significance of overlap between the input list
and the gene sets in each gene-set library for ranking a
term’s relevance to the input list. These tests are: 1) the
Fisher exact test, a test that is implemented in most gene
list enrichment analyses programs; 2) a test statistics that
we developed which is the z-score of the deviation from
the expected rank by the Fisher exact test; and 3) a com￾bined score that multiplies the log of the p-value com￾puted with the Fisher exact test by the z-score computed
by our correction to the test. The reason that we devise
a correction for the Fisher exact test was because we no￾ticed that some terms always appear on top of the
ranked list regardless of the content of the input gene
list. This is because the Fisher exact test has a slight bias
that affects the ranking of terms solely based on the
length of the gene sets in each gene-set library. This can
be seen when inputting random gene lists many times
and observing the average rank of each term (Figure 2b
and 2c). GO terms with few genes are ranked higher if
they have short lists and at least one gene from the input
list overlaps with the genes associated with the term
Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:128 Page 7 of 14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/128

(Figure 2c). For terms that have enough genes, the
rank stabilizes into what is expected for an average
rank (slightly above 150 in the plot). For the ChEA
enrichment analysis with the Fisher exact test, tran￾scription factors with many targets appear higher more
often for random input gene lists (Figure 2b). This is
because the ChEA database contain gene IDs that did
not match all the genes from our random input lists.
Hence, if the gene set library contains “noise,” i.e. gene
names that are not standardize, which is very common
because gene symbols constantly change and there are
many different resources that convert gene/protein IDs
to gene symbols, the effect of the Fisher exact test is
to give higher rank for terms with longer lists. Since
each of the three scoring methods described above
produce different ranking for terms, we next evaluated
the quality of each of the scoring scheme in an un￾biased manner.
To compare the quality of the rankings of each of these
three enrichment analysis methods, we gathered

differential gene expression data after knockdown of vari￾ous transcription factors from 10 experiments extracted
from 7 studies (Table 2). Once we have identified lists of
statistically significant differentially expressed genes,
which are either increased or decreased in expression
after the transcription factor knockdown, we examined
how the different scoring methods rank putative targets
of those factors with the expectation that the knocked￾down factors would be highly ranked when applying
enrichment analysis with the ChEA gene-set library
[10]. This analysis resulted in 104 comparisons of
transcription factors ranks because some transcription
factors have multiple entries in ChEA. The results show
that the second method, the test statistics that corrects
the bias from the Fisher exact test, which is the z-score
of the deviation from the expected rank, outperforms
the Fisher exact test and is comparable with the com￾bined scoring scheme (Figure 2d and 2e). This means
that in most cases the method ranks transcription fac￾tors higher, based on ChIP-seq data given lists of differ￾entially expressed genes after knockdown of the same
transcription factor. The combined scoring scheme is

mostly affected by the expected rank test compared
with the Fisher exact test, but its overall performance is
slightly worse compared to using the expected rank
alone. It should be noted that while this analysis shows
some advantage to the rank test over the Fisher exact
test, more evidence and tests are needed using different
gene-set libraries and experimental data to conclusively
determine that this rank test is better than the Fisher
exact test. However, it is difficult to design such ana￾lyses in an unbiased manner and the combination of
the ChEA gene-set library coupled with the loss-of
-function followed by expression data is the only setting
we could devise for such validation so far.
Application to obtain a global view of regulatory
mechanisms in cancer cell lines and their matching
normal tissues
Finally, to demonstrate how Enrichr can be applied glo￾bally to obtain a regulatory picture of cancer cell lines
and their corresponding normal tissues, we used nine gene
sets from the CCLE gene-set library and matching nine
gene sets from the Human Gene Atlas library to perform
enrichment analysis using ten other gene-set libraries:
ChEA, ENCODE TFs, Histone Modifications, KEGG,
WikiPathways, PPI Hubs, KEA, Reactome, MGI-MP and
Biocarta. We visualize the results using the grid p-value
view, coloring each grid with a different color representing

the corresponding library (Figure 3). This analysis shows in￾teresting signature patterns: first, we noticed a cluster of
transcriptional regulators from ChEA that only appears for
the cancer cell lines of ovarian, skin and small intestine can￾cers. This cluster is composed of the polycomb group com￾plex called PRC2 (highlighted in yellow circles in Figure 3).
Next, we saw that, in most of the cancer cell lines, the most
enriched terms in the histone modification grids are those
associated with H3K27me3 (blue circles in Figure 3). There
is direct evidence that the PRC2 polycomb group is res￾ponsible for the H3K27me3 specific modification [54],
confirming consistency between the ChEA and histone
modification enrichment results. Careful examination of

modifications showed that the genes are different for each
cancer and are critical tissue specific components. Hence,
compared with other cancer cell lines, in these cancer cell
lines the PRC2 complex and H3K27me3 modification is
used to silence tissue specific genes to help with the dedif￾ferentiation phenotype of cancer cells.
An interesting signature pattern was also present in
the WikiPathways grids that compared the enrichment
signatures between CD33+ myeloid positive normal
hematopoietic cells and K562 cells, which is a cell line often
used to study a specific form of leukemia. The two cell lines
share a cluster of pathways associated with Interleukin sig￾naling (green circles in Figure 3), but the normal tissue is
only enriched with Toll-like receptor signaling cluster, po￾tentially indicating the alteration in signaling in leukemia
shutting off this pathway. In addition, the highly expressed
genes in the normal hematopoietic cells form a cluster in
the MGI-MP grid which are defects in the hematopoietic
system when these genes are knocked out in mice (gray
circle in Figure 3). Finally, HUTU80 cells, a human duode￾num adenocarcinoma cell line, have a cluster in the PPI
hubs grid made of the EGFR cell signaling components
including EGFR, GRB2, PI3K, and PTPN11 as well as Src
signaling including LCK, JAK1 and STAT1, strongly
suggesting up-regulation of this pathway in this cancer.
Many more interesting clusters and patterns can be
extracted from such global view of enrichment signatures
and visualization of enriched terms on such grids.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Enrichr provides access to 35 gene-set libra￾ries with many useful libraries such as those created from
ENCODE enlisting many targets for many transcription
factors as well as a gene-set library extracted from the NIH
Roadmap Epigenomics Project for histone modifications.
Other newly created libraries include genes highly
expressed in different cell types and tissues; mouse pheno￾types from MGI-MP; structural domains; protein-protein
hubs; protein complexes; kinase substrates; differentially
phosphorylated proteins from SILAC experiments; differen￾tially expressed genes after approved drug perturbations;
and virus-host protein interactions. The results from
Enrichr are reported in four different ways: table, bar graph,
network of enriched terms, and a grid that displays all the
terms of a gene-set library while highlighting the enriched
terms. Each visual display is easily exportable to vector
graphic figures to be incorporated in publications and pre￾sentations. Enrichr also has a potentially improved method
to compute enrichment, and we demonstrated that this
method might be better than the currently widely used
Fisher exact test. In addition, we show how figures gene￾rated by Enrichr can be used to obtain a global view of cell
regulation in cancer by comparing highly expressed genes
in cancer cell lines with genes highly expressed in normal
matching tissues. Overall, Enrichr is a state-of-the-art gene
set enrichment analysis web application. Code snippets are
provided to embed Enrichr in any web-site. Enrichr is also
available as a mobile app for iPhone, Android and
Blackberry.
Availability and requirements
