Abstract
Background: To investigate the clinical and dose–volumetric parameters that predict the risk of radiation-induced
liver disease (RILD) for patients with small, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic
body radiotherapy (SBRT).
Methods: Between March 2007 and December 2009, 92 patients with HCC treated with SBRT were reviewed for
RILD within 3 months of completing treatment. RILD was evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 3.0. A dose of 10–20 Gy (median, 15 Gy) per fraction was given over 3–4 consecutive
days for a total dose of 30–60 Gy (median, 45 Gy). The following clinical and dose–volumetric parameters were
examined: age, gender, Child-Pugh class, presence of hepatitis B virus, gross tumor volume, normal liver volume,
radiation dose, fraction size, mean dose to the normal liver, and normal liver volumes receiving from < 5 Gy to < 60 Gy
(in increments of 5 Gy).
Results: Seventeen (18.5%) of the 92 patients developed grade 2 or worse RILD after SBRT (49 patients in grade 1,
11 in grade 2, and 6 in ≥ grade 3). On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class was identified as a significant clinical
parameter, while normal liver volume and normal liver volumes receiving from < 15 Gy to < 60 Gy were the
significant dose–volumetric parameters. Upon multivariate analysis, only Child-Pugh class was a significant
parameter for predicting grade 2 or worse RILD.
Conclusions: The Child-Pugh B cirrhosis was found to have a significantly greater susceptibility to the
development of grade 2 or worse RILD after SBRT in patients with small, unresectable HCC. Additional efforts
aimed at testing other models to predict the risk of RILD in a large series of HCC patients treated with SBRT are
needed.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most com￾mon malignancies, ranking sixth worldwide [1]. Surgical
resection and liver transplantation are the primary treat￾ment modalities for HCC [2-4]. However, strict criteria
limit the pool of eligible patients for both approaches. Ra￾diofrequency ablation (RFA) can also be used with curative
intent for small HCC which is unsuitable for surgery [5,6].
However, the proximity of the tumor to the main blood
vessels, gall bladder, diaphragm, and liver surface presents
major restrictions to use of RFA. Consequently, overall,
only 30–40% of patients may derive benefit from the
various radical curative treatments due to the numer￾ous clinical conditions [7]. Therefore, in these clinical
settings, alternative local therapeutic modalities are ur￾gently needed.
With the development of three-dimensional conformal
radiotherapy (3D-CRT), image-guided treatment and the
resulting accumulation of knowledge on partial-volume
liver tolerance, high-dose radiation could be delivered to
focal liver volumes, thereby allowing radiotherapy as an
alternative option for small intrahepatic tumors [8]. Sev￾eral studies demonstrated that stereotactic body radiother￾apy (SBRT) with 24–60 Gy administered in three to six
fractions achieved high local control and overall survival
rates of 65–100% and 48–82% at 1 year, respectively
[9-13]. While many studies have demonstrated that
variable factors are associated with radiation-induced
liver disease (RILD) after conventional radiotherapy,
only a few have examined RILD after SBRT and their re￾sults focused on clinical outcome and local control
[8,12,14-17]. Recently, one study was aimed at identify￾ing the parameters to predict hepatic toxicity and the
deterioration of hepatic function [18]. However, additional
studies are warranted to confirm the previous results.
Thus, the aim of the present study is to analyze the
clinical and dose–volumetric parameters that predict the
risk of RILD in patients with small, unresectable HCC
treated with SBRT.
Methods
Patient selection
Patients who underwent SBRT for primary or recurrent
HCC were registered and the database was retrospectively
reviewed between March 2007 and December 2009. Eli￾gibility criteria were as follows: (1) HCC not treatable
by surgery or percutaneous ablative therapies; (2) HCC
confined to the liver without extrahepatic metastases;
(3) HCC < 6 cm in the longest diameter, and the pres￾ence of up to three lesions; (4) HCC with no evidence of
major vascular invasion; (5) Child-Pugh A or B liver
function; (6) adequate residual functional liver volume;
(7) a sufficient distance (> 2 cm) of the tumor(s) from
adjacent organs at risk, including duodenum, stomach,
colon, and spinal cord; (8) an incomplete response after
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or unsuitable
for TACE by a physician’s decision; and (9) no history of
previous external beam radiotherapy.
From the registered patients, those with data allowing
analyses of clinical and dose–volumetric parameters pre￾dictive of the risk of RILD were selected. Further selection
criteria were as follows: (1) availability of dosimetric pa￾rameters of SBRT and (2) follow-up times >3 months,
with available biochemical profiles after SBRT. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the Asan Medical Center, and informed consent in
writing was obtained from each patient in the study.
SBRT procedure
At least one week before computed tomography (CT)
simulation, three fiducial markers (Standard Gold Soft
Tissue Markers, CIVCO Medical Solutions, Kalona, IA)
were inserted into the liver parenchyma around the tu￾mors under ultrasonographic guidance in almost all pa￾tients except who had surgical clips or compact iodized
oil from previous treatment. Pillows and vacuum molds
were used for patient immobilization: 4-dimensional
CT simulation was carried out (GE LightSpeed RT 16;
GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with free breathing. CT
series were sorted according to respiratory phase using
4D imaging software (Advantage 4D version 4.2; GE
Healthcare). Gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated
based on the visible gross tumor as seen on the CT images
at end-expiratory phase; extension based on movement
within the gating phase (30–70%) from the GTV was set
as the internal target volume (ITV). Planning target vol￾ume (PTV) margin was 5 mm from the ITV. SBRT was
planned using coplanar and/or non-coplanar 3D-CRT
method with energies of 6 or 15 MV and delivered using a
Varian-iX machine equipped with On-Board Imager (OBI)
and Millennium 120 multileaf collimators (Varian Medical
Systems). A dose of 10–20 Gy (median, 15 Gy) per frac￾tion was given over 3–4 consecutive days to a total dose of
30–60 Gy (median, 45 Gy). The chosen isodose covering
PTV was between 85–90%, which was normalized to the
center of the PTV. Contouring and treatment planning
were done by a 3D-radiotherapy planning system (Eclipse
V8.0; Varian Medical Systems) using pencil beam convolu￾tion algorithm with heterogeneity correction with spatial
resolution of 2.5 mm. Image guidance, including cone￾beam CT and gated fluoroscopy, was performed prior to
administrating each fraction of SBRT using the OBI.
Evaluation of RILD
All patients were examined during SBRT to assess acute
toxicity. After treatment, the patients were followed up
every 1–3 months. Follow-up consisted of physical ex￾aminations, complete blood counts, biochemical profiles,

tumor markers, and dynamic CT or MRI studies. RILD
was defined as an elevation in transaminases or alkaline
phosphatase of at least 2.5- to 5-fold and/or in bilirubin
of at least 1.5- to 3-fold compared to either the upper
normal limit or the pretreatment level, corresponding to
grade 2 or higher hepatic toxicity according to the Com￾mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
version 3.0, and/or non-malignant ascites in the ab￾sence of disease progression within 3 months after
SBRT. This endpoint was modified from the classic
and non-classic RILD proposed by the Quantitative Ana￾lyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC)
recommendation [19].
Statistical analysis
The probabilities of cumulative survival and time to pro￾gression were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method
and the survival differences were analyzed by the log￾rank test.
The clinical and dose–volumetric parameters analyzed
were age, gender, Child-Pugh class, presence of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) infection, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance score (ECOG PS), GTV, PTV, nor￾mal liver volume, radiation dose, fraction size, mean
dose to the normal liver, dose to 33% of the normal liver
(D33%), dose to 50% of the normal liver (D50%), and the
normal liver volumes receiving from < 5 Gy to < 60 Gy
in increments of 5 Gy (respectively, rV5Gy (reverse-V5Gy),
rV10Gy, rV15Gy, rV20Gy, rV25Gy, rV30Gy, rV35Gy, rV40Gy,
rV45Gy, rV50Gy, rV55Gy, and rV60Gy). Chi-square and
Student’s t-test, for clinical parameters, and binary logistic
regression, for dose–volumetric parameters, were per￾formed for univariate analysis of an association with the
risk of grade 2 or higher RILD. Multivariate analyses
included only those variables with a p-value < 0.05 as de￾termined in the univariate analysis. All statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS statistical package (version
12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 129 patients with HCC who were treated with
SBRT were registered between March 2007 and December
2009 at our institution. Among these, 37 patients were ex￾cluded in the current analysis for the various reasons in
Figure 1. The remaining 92 patients met the selection cri￾teria. The characteristics and the dosimetric parameters of
patients are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Clinical outcomes
The median follow-up period for all patients was
25.7 months (range: 1.8-55.4 months). During the ob￾servation periods, 51 patients were alive and 41 patients
were deceased. The 1- and 3-year survival rates were
86.9% and 54.4% respectively; with the median survival
of 53.6 months. The development of grade 2 or worse
RILD did not affect the survival of patients (p = 0.099).
Radiological tumor response was evaluated in 91 pa￾tients (101 lesions) at 3 months after SBRT. Of these, 53
(51.9%) achieved complete response, 22 (21.6%) achieved
partial response, and 26 (25.5%) achieved stable disease
according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors. Local control rate at 3 years was 92.1%
and median time to progression was 11.1 months.
All patients received SBRT regimen as planned, and
displayed no intolerable radiation-induced side effects
for interruptions. Fatigue and anorexia were the most

common acute toxicities; however these were mostly
CTCAE grade 1.
Univariate analysis for the risk of RILD
Of the 92 patients, 49 (53.3%) developed grade 1, 11
(11.9%) developed grade 2, and 6 (6.5%) developed ≥ grade
3 RILD after SBRT. All cases of RILD occurred within
1–3 months after SBRT. None of the patients had an
abnormal liver function test during treatment.
On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class was identified
as a significant clinical parameter, while normal liver vol￾ume and normal liver volumes receiving from < 15 Gy
to < 60 Gy were the significant dose–volumetric param￾eters. Neither the presence of HBV infection nor ECOG
PS, GTV, PTV, radiation dose, fraction size, or mean
dose to the normal liver contributed to the risk of devel￾oping RILD (Table 3).
Multivariate analysis for the risk of RILD
Multivariate analysis included only those variables with a
p-value of less than 0.05, as determined in univariate ana￾lysis. To eliminate the effect of multi-colinearity among
the several significant dose-volumetric parameters, only
the normal liver volume receiving < 20 Gy (rV20Gy), which
was the most significant parameter with the Hosmer￾Lemeshow test, was included in multivariate analysis.
Upon multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh class was the only
significant parameter for predicting grade 2 or worse RILD
(Table 4).
Discussion
The present study evaluated a relatively large number of
patients with HCC who received high-dose irradiation
(≥ 10 Gy per fraction). Upon multivariate analysis, only
the Child-Pugh class was of statistical significance in

predicting the risk of RILD development. By contrast,
the optimal dose–volumetric parameter predictive of
RILD could not be determined. The baseline liver con￾dition is thought to be the most important factor associ￾ated with the risk of RILD after high-dose radiotherapy,
even if the irradiated volume is small.
Our results showed that patients with Child-Pugh B
cirrhosis more frequently developed RILD than did pa￾tients with Child-Pugh A liver function. Similar results
were obtained in some previous studies of conventional
radiotherapy for primary liver tumors, which concluded
that baseline liver function was an important factor in
predicting the occurrence of RILD [15,20]. The sug￾gested mechanism was that a severely cirrhotic liver is
less tolerable to irradiation because cirrhosis prevents
the repair of radiation injury as well as the cellular pro￾liferation, which is required to compensate for the loss
of hepatic function. An association between the risk of
RILD and liver function status after SBRT for HCC has
been found in a limited numbers of studies. Mendez
Romero et al. conducted the prospective trial of SBRT in
the treatment of primary liver tumors and prescribed
different dose-fraction schedules according to the tumor
size and presence of cirrhosis. Acute toxicities ≥ grade 3
were observed in four patients, and one patient with
HCC and Child-Pugh B liver function developed liver
failure together with an infection and died. The authors
therefore concluded that extreme caution is required for
patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis due to high risk of
toxicity [11]. In the series of Cardenes et al., the pre￾scribed dose was increased to 48 Gy (16 Gy/fraction) in
patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis without dose￾limiting toxicity, however, two patients with Child-Pugh
B liver function developed CTCAE grade 3 hepatic tox￾icities at the 42 Gy (14 Gy/fraction) level [9]. The results
of these studies further support liver function as one of
the most important factors in RILD, even though the ir￾radiated volume treated with SBRT was much smaller
than that targeted by 3D-CRT.
Several dose–volumetric parameters associated with
RILD after 3D-CRT has been reported in the literature;
however, reports evaluating acute and late hepatic toxic￾ities after SBRT for HCC are scarce. Rusthoven et al. re￾ported hepatotoxicity after 36–60 Gy, administered in
three fractions, for the treatment of liver metastases,
none of the 47 patients experienced late hepatotoxicity
[12]. Lee et al. also evaluated RILD after SBRT in 68 pa￾tients with metastatic liver tumors who received a me￾dian dose of 41.8 Gy in six fractions and reported no
occurrence of RILD or other grade 3–5 liver toxicity
[14]. Notwithstanding these results of metastatic liver

tumors, dose–volumetric parameters to predict RILD in
patients with HCC who underwent SBRT were also re￾ported. Son et al. reported that 12 patients developed
grade 2 or higher hepatic toxicity after SBRT for small
HCCs in 36 patients. This study focused not only on
RILD but on the progression of Child-Pugh class as an
endpoint for toxicity. The only significant parameter asso￾ciated with the progression of Child-Pugh class (4 pa￾tients, 11%), as determined by multivariate analysis, was
the total liver volume receiving a dose < 18 Gy. The au￾thors therefore recommended that the total liver volume
receiving < 18 Gy should be > 800 cm3
, to reduce the risk
of a deterioration of hepatic function [18]. Table 5 summa￾rizes the toxicities reported in several studies of SBRT for
primary and metastatic liver tumors.
The liver function of patients with HCC is usually
already compromised prior to tumor development due
to the pre-existing cirrhosis after chronic liver disease,
whereas this is generally not the case in patients with
metastatic liver tumors. Accordingly, the QUANTEC
defines a non-classic RILD and recommends that this
endpoint could be appropriate in HCC patients who
have poor liver function including HBV infection. They
also suggest that CTCAE is most useful for scoring
non-classic RILD [19]. This is the reason why we adopt
non-classic RILD as the endpoint of the present study.
However, we cannot neglect classic RILD which occur
occasionally in patients with HCC after radiotherapy
and modify the endpoint as described previously. Up to
now, the definition of RILD in patients with HCC was
somewhat different among the studies. Moreover, a con￾founder, such as the progression of cirrhosis regardless
of any treatment, is an important hurdle to define RILD
especially in populations with pre-existing liver dysfunc￾tion [19]. For a definite answer to RILD after SBRT, we
have to overcome many obstacles to the definition of
toxicity and exact meaning of laboratory findings in the
follow-up examination.
In the present study, a significant dose–volumetric par￾ameter, including mean liver dose, associated with RILD
could not be identified on multivariate analysis. This is
partly because SBRT is a safe modality even in patients
with underlying liver disease. The median GTV (8.6 cm3
,
range 0.6–125.3 cm3
) was smaller than that reported in
the study of Son et al. (18.3 cm3
, range 3.0–81.3 cm3
) and
the incidence of RILD ≥ grade 2 was also lower. Therefore,
the incidence of RILD was not increased significantly, even
though the number of patients treated with SBRT was in￾creased. This is one of the reasons for the low statistical
power of the present study. However, this is not sufficient
to explain the assumption. Another possibility is that
RILD may be induced by unknown causes including the
production of cytokines, regardless of the irradiated
normal liver volume. Hence if the mentioned assump￾tion is true, the RILD can occur randomly after SBRT
for small HCC. A dose–volumetric parameter associ￾ated with the risk of RILD could not be determined,
even based on a definition of RILD as mild toxicity
(grade 2). There are also no studies suggesting a normal
tissue complication probability (NTCP) model to pre￾dict the risk of RILD after SBRT at doses ≥ 10 Gy per
fraction. In light of the small number of cases of RILD,
further studies in a larger series will be needed to con￾struct an appropriate NTCP model.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the Child-Pugh B cirrhosis was found to
have a significantly greater susceptibility to the develop￾ment of grade 2 or worse RILD after SBRT in patients
with small, unresectable HCC. Additional efforts aimed at
testing other models to predict the risk of RILD in a large
series of HCC patients treated with SBRT are needed.
Moreover, many obstacles to the definition of liver toxicity
and meaning of laboratory findings should be overcome in
patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction.
