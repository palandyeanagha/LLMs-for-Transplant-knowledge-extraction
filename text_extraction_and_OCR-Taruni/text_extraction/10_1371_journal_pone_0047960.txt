Abstract
Background: Albuminuria is recognized as a marker of vascular dysfunction. Central obesity increases the risk of
cardiovascular disease. Little is known about the association between albuminuria and central obesity in Chinese. We aimed
to assess the association between central obesity and prevalence and incidence of albuminuria in a middle-aged
population-based cohort study.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study. A total of 2350 subjects aged $40 years were recruited in
2004 in Taiwan for cross-sectional analysis. Longitudinal analysis included 1432 baseline normoalbuminuria subjects with a
mean 2.8 years follow-up, 67 of whom exhibited incident albuminuria. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to￾creatinine ratio $30 mg/g creatinine. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between
central obesity and prevalence and incidence of albuminuria after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, blood
pressure, renal function, glucose, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, smoking, betel nut chewing, alcohol drinking, and
physical activity.
Results: At baseline, albuminuria is significantly associated with central obesity. The adjusted odds ratio of having
albuminuria among subjects with central obesity was 1.73(95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–2.85), compared to the
subjects without central obesity. In multivariable models, participants with central obesity at baseline had a 112% increase
in risk of incident albuminuria (adjusted incidence rate ratio (95% CI): 2.12(1.01–4.44)) compared with participants with non￾central obesity.
Conclusions: Abdominal adiposity was independently associated with increased prevalence and incidence of albuminuria in
Chinese. The mechanisms linking adiposity and albuminuria need to be addressed.

Introduction
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is an important and burden￾some disease worldwide. Data from the US Renal Data System
(2011) reported that Taiwan is the country with the highest
incidence and prevalence of ESRD [1]. Albuminuria is an early
marker of vascular dysfunction and renal disease which has been
linked to an increased risk for future cardiovascular disease,
ESRD, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/all-cause mortality
[2,3,4,5]. Albuminuria is not only common in people with specific
diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension but also in the general
population [6]. To identify the early risk factors of albuminuria
had become very important in Taiwan as well as other countries
with a high prevalence of ESRD.
Obesity has been recognized as a serious health problem,
leading to an increased risk of many chronic diseases, such as
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, lung function impairment, chronic
kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [7,8,9,10,11]
and associated with increased CVD and all-cause mortality
[12,13]. The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically
globally [14]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
estimated that approximately 1.6 billion are overweight and at
least 400 million adults are obese [15]. It further estimates that
approximately 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and more than
700 million will be obese by 2015 [15]. In the United States, the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e47960

prevalence of obesity in adults doubled between 1986 and 2000
and it is anticipated that 3 of every 4 adults will be overweight or
obese by the year 2020 [16,17]. While the prevalence of obesity is
high and rising in developed countries, the increase is often faster
in developing nations. For example, in the Nutrition and Health
Surveys in Taiwan of 1993–1996 and 2005–2008, the prevalence
of overweight or obesity (body mass index (BMI) $24 kg/m2
)
increased from 33.4% to 50.8% in adult men and from 19.7% to
24.8% in adult women, and central obesity (waist circumference
$90 cm in men and/or $80 cm in women) increased from 31.7%
to 36.9% and 12.2% to 33.6% in men and women, respectively
[18]. Obesity consists of excessive fat deposits throughout in the
body, whereas central obesity denotes excessive fat in the mid￾body region, much of it in the intra-abdominal area. Compared
with overall obesity, central obesity appears to be more strongly
associated with CVD risk factors and other chronic diseases
[12,19,20,21]. Only a few studies have reported that albuminuria
is associated with central obesity [22,23]. For example, Bonnet et
al. reported that elevated waist circumference is related to the
development of elevated albuminuria in non-diabetic subjects
[23]. These studies, however, either had small sample sizes, were
cross-sectional studies, were done on Caucasian, or were focused
on subjects with a specific condition, such as non-diabetic subjects.
We conducted a population-based cohort study in a metropolitan
city in Taiwan to investigate the association between central
obesity and prevalence and incidence of albuminuria in Chinese
middle-aged adults.
Materials and Methods
Baseline subjects
The target population consisted of residents of Taichung city,
Taiwan who were age 40 and above in October, 2004, as
described in previous reports [2,24]. There were a total of 363,543
residents in this area during the time of study, which represented
about 4.09% of the national population of the same age. A Two￾stage sampling design was used to draw residents, with sampling
rate proportional to size within each stage. 4280 individuals were
randomly selected. During household visits, we identified 750
individuals that were ineligible and excluded them from the study
sample. The reasons for exclusion included death (n = 18),
hospitalization or imprisonment (n = 14), living abroad (n = 39),
moving out (n = 411), living in their children’s house (n = 7),
mistake of the sampling frame (n = 59), and not being at home
during 3 visits made by interviewers (n = 202). Among 3530
individuals selected, 2359 agreed to participate. Subjects with
incomplete data for urine albumin test were excluded. The final
sample was 2350 subjects. The selected subjects (n = 2350) and
deleted subjects (n = 9) were not statistically significantly different
in age, height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, and hip
circumference.
Follow-up cohort subjects
After baseline measurement, subjects were invited to participate
in the follow-up study. The study population selection is depicted
in Figure 1. Among these 2350 subjects, 1646 subjects (overall
follow-up rate, 71.3%) agreed to participate in the follow-up study
before the end of July, 2009. Subjects with albuminuria at baseline
(n = 199) or that had incomplete data for urinary albumin-to￾creatinine ratio (UACR) at follow-up (n = 15) were excluded from
further longitudinal analysis. 1432 subjects with a mean 2.8 years
follow-up were finally included in the longitudinal analysis, with 67
cases of incident albuminuria.
Anthropometric index and laboratory assays
Trained staff measured height, waist and hip circumference,
weight, and blood pressure (BP) as previously reported [2,24,25].
BMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2
).
Central obesity was defined as waist circumference $90 cm in
men and/or $80 cm in women, thresholds that have been
developed specific to Asian populations based on the observation
that obesity-related complications in Asians occur at lower BMI
cut-points than those used in Caucasians [26]. Blood was drawn in
the morning after a 12-hour overnight fast and was sent for
analysis within 4 hours of collection. High sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hsCRP) levels were measured by nephelometry, a latex
particle-enhanced immunoassay (TBA-200FR, Tokyo, Japan).
The inter-assay and intra-assay CVs were ,2.0% and ,1.9%,
respectively. Diabetes was defines as: (1) fasting plasma glucose
concentration $7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) and/or (2) diabetes
history on oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin treatment.
Sociodemographic factors and life style behaviors
Age, gender, employment, education, diet habit, and physical
activity were collected by self-administered questionnaires. Smok￾ing, alcohol drinking, and betel nut chewing history were divided
into 3 classes as follows: never, former, and current. Physical
activity status was divided into 2 classes: never/seldom and
current.
Albuminuria and renal function
Renal function was evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR), which was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal
Figure 1. Taichung Community Health Study (TCHS) popula￾tion selection.

Disease formula as follows: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2
) = 1866(serum
creatinine (mg/dL))21.1546(age)20.2036(0.742 if female). A
UACR$30 mg/g defined albuminuria and normoalbuminuria was
,30 mg/g. Within albuminuria, UACR ranging from 30 mg/g to
300 mg/g was defined as microalbuminuria and above 300 mg/g was
macroalbuminuria.
Statistical analysis
The data are presented as means and standard deviation unless
indicated otherwise. Student’s t-test was used to compare mean
values. Variables with significant deviation from normal distribu￾tion were log transformed and assessed by a Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test before further analyses. The Pearson’s x2 test was
used to compare the differences in the categorical variables (such
as smoking, alcohol drinking, betel nut chewing, and physical
activity) across central obesity or albuminuria status. Multiple
logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations
between prevalence and incidence of albuminuria and central
obesity after adjustment for potential confounders. All statistical
tests were 2-sided at the 0.05 significance level. Data were
analyzed for the whole cohort and separately for men and women
using the PC version of SPSS statistical software (17th version,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Ethics approval for patient recruitment and data analyses was
obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the China
Medical University Hospital. All subjects signed an informed
consent form before data collection.

obesity were older and had greater height, weight, BMI, waist
circumference, systolic and diastolic BP, fasting glucose,
hsCRP, UACR, prevalence of diabetes, and lower eGFR
than subjects without central obesity. The prevalence of
diabetes in baseline cohort was 12.1% (14.1% in men and
10.2% in women). Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics
according to albuminuria level. The overall prevalence of
albuminuria was 13.0% (14.1% in men and 11.9% in women).
Subjects with albuminuria were older and had greater height,
BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic BP, fasting
glucose, hsCRP, UACR, prevalence of diabetes, and lower
eGFR than subjects without albuminuria. Table 3 shows
unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence
intervals, CI) of having albuminuria derived from a multiple
logistic regression analysis using central obesity as indepen￾dent variables after adjustment for potential confounders.
After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, systolic and diastolic BP,
fasting glucose, hsCRP, eGFR, smoking, alcohol drinking,
betel nut chewing, and physical activity status, multiple
logistic regression analyses revealed that central obesity was
significantly associated with albuminuria(p,0.05). Compared
to the subjects without central obesity, the adjusted ORs of
having albuminuria among subjects with central obesity was
1.73(95% CI: 1.04–2.85) (1.39 (0.69–2.84) in men and
2.35(1.10–5.01) in women) (Table 3 model 2). In the baseline
sample, 39 subjects (19 men, 20 women) had macroalbumin￾uria. Results from Table 3 model 2 remained essentially
unchanged when these subjects were excluded (the adjusted
ORs = 1.66(1.00–2.75), p,0.05).
Albuminuria incidence: longitudinal analysis
Of 1432 men and women, mean (6SD) age of 58.1610.3 years
with 2.8 mean years of follow-up, 67 (4.7%) developed albumin￾uria. The incidence rate was 16.6/1000 person-year (non-central

31.2/1000person-years). Table 4 shows the age adjusted
incidence rate ratio (IRR) and multivariate adjusted IRR for
BMI and central obesity in relation to albuminuria. Participants
with central obesity had a 112% increase in the risk of albuminuria
(IRR: 2.12, 95% CI:1.01,4.44) compared to participants without
central obesity after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, smoking,
alcohol drinking, betel nut chewing, physical activity, systolic BP,
diastolic BP, hsCRP, fasting glucose, and eGFR. Further stratified
by gender, the IRR (95% CI) in men and women was 1.67(0.59–
4.76) and 3.13(1.06–9.22), respectively (Table 4).
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that central obesity is significantly
associated with albuminuria in middle-aged Chinese, even with
adjustment for general obesity, hsCRP, renal function and lifestyle
factors. We also found that subjects with central obesity tend to
develop albuminuria, independently of BMI. These findings were
most pronounced in women.
The association between central obesity and albuminuria has
been previously reported [22,27]. For example, in the Look
AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study, increased BMI
and abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference) were
found to be associated with albuminuria in overweight and obese
adults with type 2 diabetes [27]. de Boer et al. also found that waist
circumference predicts the subsequent development of microalbu￾minuria in type 1 diabetes [28]. Thoenes et al found that
abdominal obesity is associated with microalbuminuria and an
elevated cardiovascular risk profile in patients from 26 countries
with hypertension [29]. Chandie Shaw et al. also reported that
central obesity (measured by waist-to-hip ratio) is independent risk
factor for increased albuminuria in normoglycemic South Asian
subjects [22]. A similar finding was observed in the Copenhagen
City Heart Study [30]. These studies provide an agreement that
adiposity is associated with albuminuria. However, these studies
are either cross-sectional studies or focused on specific conditions
or diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension subjects. Our study is
a population-based cohort survey which demonstrates that central
obesity is associated with an increased risk of prevalence and
incidence of albuminuria in Chinese. In addition, this study
provides confirmatory data that the reduced cut-points for
abdominal obesity specific to Asian populations are sensitive
predictors of albuminuria, similar to thresholds used in Cauca￾sians.
Sex difference is another point worthy of mention in this study.
Foster et al. reported that, in the Framingham Heart Study,
visceral adipose tissue is associated with microalbuminuria in men
but not in women [31]. Our result showed that central obesity is
more strongly associated with albuminuria in women than in men.
Our previous study also found that hsCRP is closely associated
with metabolic syndrome in women than in men [32]. Sullivan et
al. reported that the renal protection afforded to female
hypertensive rats is associated with lower blood pressure,
decreased macrophage infiltration, and decreased levels of
oxidative stress [33]. In this gender difference, sex hormones
may play an important role on the inflammatory mechanism
which links central obesity and albuminuria, and these merit
further study.
Several mechanisms link central obesity to albuminuria have
been proposed. Firstly, compared to general obesity, central
obesity is more strongly associated with inflammatory markers and
oxidative stress which may increase the risks of CVD and other

chronic diseases, such as hypertension or diabetes
[19,25,29,34,35,36,37]. These chronic diseases are closely related
to microalbuminuria [25]. In the current study, we also found that
subjects with central obesity or albuminuria had higher hsCRP
level than non-central obesity or normoalbuminuria. Second,
studies reported that the adipocyte hormone adiponectin and
leptin, which can regulate podocyte function, may play an
important role in the development of obesity-related albuminuria
[38,39,40]. A possible mechanism by which central obesity
promotes glomerular damage and induces microalbuminuria is
through decreasing serum adiponectin and increasing serum leptin
levels [38,41]. Third, central obesity is an underlying feature of
insulin resistance. Subjects with insulin resistance may increase
urinary albumin excretion, leading progressively to chronic kidney
disease [42,43]. Therefore, central obesity may, through insulin
resistance, increase the risk of albuminuria and glomerular
damage. Fourth, central obesity may activate the transforming
growth factor beta (TGF-b)-related mechanisms, leading to
glomerular hyperfiltration. Glomerular hyperfiltration causes
renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) activation which leads to renal
damage [37,44]. Previous studies reported that the use of
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition in patients with uncom￾plicated type 1 DM results in a significant decline in hyperfiltration
[44,45,46]. Obesity also increases renal tubular sodium reabsorp￾tion which impaired renal pressure natriuresis [46]. Fifth, central
obesity may induce hyperleptinemia through sympathetic nervous
system activation, thus stimulating the hypothalamic pro-opiome￾lanocortin pathway to cause renal damage [46,47].
A strength of this study is that it uses a population-based
prospective cohort not limited to specific conditions or diseases,
and as such may be more representative of the general population
than previous studies. Second, we demonstrate the strong
association between central obesity and albuminuria in the
baseline population using a cross-sectional design. Our study
design enabled us to infer causality of central obesity on
albuminuria incidence after 3 years of follow-up. Third, our
sample size is large enough to enable adjustment of potential
confounders to minimize bias. One limitation associated with this
study was that the diagnosis of albuminuria was depended on a
spot urine sample, which may not represent the true level of
urinary albumin excretion. The potential misclassification, how￾ever, is likely non-differential with our results. Second, our findings
may not be generalizable to young adults because we recruited
subjects aged 40 and older. Third, the purely Chinese sample may
limit the generalizability of our results to other races or ethnic
populations.
In summary, subjects with central obesity had increased
prevalence and incidence of albuminuria in a population-based
middle-aged Chinese cohort. This association was stronger in
women than in men. Albuminuria may be one of the major
complications of central obesity. Obesity-associated renal disease
should be prevented or treated by weight reduction.
