Abstract
The development of the sequencing technologies allowed the generation of huge amounts of molecular data from a
single cancer specimen, allowing the clinical oncology to enter the era of the precision medicine. This massive amount
of data is highlighting new details on cancer pathogenesis but still relies on tissue biopsies, which are unable to
capture the dynamic nature of cancer through its evolution. This assumption led to the exploration of non-tissue
sources of tumoral material opening the field of liquid biopsies. Blood, together with body fluids such as urines, or
stool, from cancer patients, are analyzed applying the techniques used for the generation of omics data. With blood,
this approach would allow to take into account tumor heterogeneity (since the circulating components such as CTCs,
ctDNA, or ECVs derive from each cancer clone) in a time dependent manner, resulting in a somehow “real-time”
understanding of cancer evolution. Liquid biopsies are beginning nowdays to be applied in many cancer contexts and
are at the basis of many clinical trials in oncology.
Facts
● Oncology has entered the era of Precision Medicine.
we still however struggle in capturing the dynamic
nature of cancer. ● Liquid biopsies represent a valuable source of
information on each individual cancer and can be
used to monitor cancer evolution. ● Components of liquid biopsies (CTCs, ctDNA,
ctRNA and ECVs) have been proven to correlate
with cancer prognosis and cancer biology in many
clinical cancer entities (such as breast cancer or
neuroblastoma).
Open questions
● Are liquid biopsies sufficient to capture tumoral
evolution? ● How can we discriminate the cancer subclones￾derived components of liquid biopsies? ● Will liquid biopsies ever overcome tissue biopsies in
the clinical management of cancer?
Background
Clinical oncology has been relying on the increasing
amount of molecular data which can be obtained from single
cancer specimens1
. The molecular profiling of gene muta￾tions for prognostic predictions or for therapy selection can
be accounted as a standard approach in many cancer entities
since decades. The scientific community moved from a
purely histopathologic cancer diagnosis to a molecular-based
one, allowing clinicians to develop more accurate and com￾plex prognostic scores, as well as to select better treatment
options according to the mutational background of a given

neoplasm (as in the case of EGFR or ALK mutations in lung
cancer2
, or the V600E mutation of BRAF in either colorectal
cancer3 or melanoma, as prominent examples). This
approach opened the era of targeted therapies and, to some
extent, to precision medicine4–6
. “Intelligent drugs” designed
to specifically target a precise molecular objective, have
entered the clinics alongside classic chemotherapy or sub￾stituting it7
. Although this new options generated great
therapeutical advances in many cancer contexts (such as the
VEGF/VEGFR targeting in kidney cancer8 or in hepatocel￾lular carcinoma, or the anti-BCR/Abl rearrangement for the
therapy of chronic monocytic leukemia9
) they still often
result in a time limited controlled status of the disease,
invariably leading to cancer progression in most cases,
without considering primary refractories cancer entities,
which are not responsive to given targeted therapies since the
beginning10. Sometimes, this inevitable failure is partially due
to the heterogeneous nature of cancers and to the evolutive
pressure that is mediated by cancer treatment itself. Tumor
biopsies can give limited information on a single cancer
entity, since they cannot account for its intrinsic tumor
heterogeneity and, moreover, for its evolution during time,
due to their invasive nature which impairs the possibility of
their repetition to follow cancer evolution11–15.
Great advances in the sequencing technologies are at
the roots of the generation of many more accurate
molecular data from single cancer specimens. Whole
cancer genomes analysis can now be performed at rela￾tively low costs, together with many other “omics”, such
as whole transcriptomic or proteomic (which can also be
further completed by phospho-proteomics, giving a wide
picture on the activation of signaling pathways)15–24.
These techniques led to the generation of vast amounts of
data derived from a single cancer specimen (a diagnostic
biopsy or a surgical removal of the disease), therefore
determining a molecular deep characterization of a single
cancer in a precise and limited time of the disease.
Cancer specimens are not the most ideal source material
for capturing the dynamic nature of cancers, since they
cannot be repeated during the evolution of the disease due to
their invasive nature. Anyway, tissues like blood, have been
shown to harbor many biological entities which directly
derive from cancer itself and can be exploited as the ideal
source for liquid biopsies (Fig. 1)
25–28.
Liquid biopsies in cancer
The circulating blood reflects primary and metastatic
tumor biology, since tumor cells are more prone than
normal cells to release nucleic acids into the bloodstream
upon death. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and well as
circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) can be purified from the
plasma of cancer patients, and analyzed through next
Fig. 1 The multiomics approach on liquid biopsies. The information collected from a single blood specimen can reflect the evolution of a single
cancer from many biological points of view. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) highly reflect the complexity of the pathology, especially regarding tumor
heterogeneity. Full genomic (whole genome sequencing) and transcriptomic analysis can be applied to CTCs and can be used as well for the growth of
cancer organoids. Circulating proteins can also reflect the tumor secretome and can be analyzed through spectrometric approaches such as proteomics
and phosho-proteomics. Moreover, circulating tumor DNA can be purified and used for whole or targeted sequencing. Picture created with Biorender.com.

generation sequencing or targeted sequencing. Both
normal and tumoral DNA are circulating and cannot be
properly separated form each other but the most abun￾dant source of cell-free DNA is the tumoral one (a mass of
100 g of tumor burden is estimated to release 3.3% of its
DNA content) with a 10–100-fold abundancy compared
to the normal DNA29.
Liquid biopsies can also rely on other aspects of cancer
tumorigenesis such as on circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
and extra-cellular vesicles (ECVs)30. CTCs can be isolated
from peripheral blood and discriminated form normal
cells using anti-EpCAM or anti-CK or CD45 selection
methods. They are extremely rare (<10 cells/ml of blood)
and have been isolated from almost all human cancers.
CTCs correlate with prognosis and with a metastatic
disease status and their clinical role in defining cancer
prognosis has been stated by the FDA approval for their
detection in breast cancer and prostate cancer31,32. CTCs
account for tumor heterogeneity since the circulating cells
reflect cancer subclones and can be the ideal source for
whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analysis.
Moreover, they can also be used to establish organoids
cultures, which are proven to be a valuable in vitro
reproduction of an individual cancer33.
Moving from cells to smaller biological entities, ECVs
can be separated from plasma through different meth￾odologies (size exclusion chromatography, affinity
purification, and differential ultracentrifugation). As
compared to the proteomic profiling of circulating pro￾teins, ECVs show highly enriched exosome proteins and
therefore constitute a valuable source of information from
a single cancer. Proteins are not the only components of
ECVs since tumor DNA and RNA (especially micro-RNA)
are also present. Moreover, they are not solely inert
tumoral material, since they can function as signal
transductor and are highly present in the tumor micro￾environment, where they can signal through an autocrine/
paracrine pathway or be released in the bloodstream for
long distance signaling34,35.
Blood is surely the most characterized tissue available
for liquid biopsies while many other corporeal fluids are
suitable for the detection of tumoral components. Saliva,
urines, seminal fluids, tears, and stool have been analyzed
to understand their correlation with cancer36. Stool in
particular have been thoroughly evaluated in the context
of gastrointestinal cancers, and proved to be a valuable
source of tumoral DNA for pancreatic cancer37–40. Stool
analysis from a multiomics perspective is also able to
integrate information on the role of the microbiome in
cancer pathogenesis, especially in the case of colorectal
cancer and pancreatic cancer, as well as in other disease
entities such as inflammatory intestinal diseases41–43. The
microbiota creates a complex network that can influence
the tumor microenvironment in a very heterogeneous way
that relies on the intrinsically heterogeneity of the micro￾biome itself44–49. The microbiome study, also through
liquid biopsies, would also grant some other information
related to the geography of diseases, among which cancer,
since the intestinal bacteria are able to differentiate indi￾viduals on the basis of the place they live in50–54.
The main advantage of a liquid biopsy approach basi￾cally stands with the possibility to capture tumor het￾erogeneity in a whole (all the tumor subclones release
CTCs and ctDNA in the bloodstream) through its evo￾lution, since they are totally not harmful for the patients.
The combination of this approach, together with the
study of the related omics, has led to promising results in
the oncology world.
This review will focus on two disease entities, breast
cancer and neuroblastoma, to highlight the state of art in
the field.
Liquid biopsies for breast cancer
Breast cancer represent a striking evidence for the
advantage of liquid biopsies use in the everyday medical
treatment. The Cellsearch® test has been approved by
FDA for the extraction and selection of CTCs from breast
cancer patients (but also for prostate cancer) for the
determination of their prognosis (Fig. 2)
55,56.
CTCs arise during early stages of breast cancer as
shown on triple negative breast cancer patients (TBNC),
where this cell population at diagnosis is quite hetero￾geneous in terms of expression of hormone receptors
(HR), HER2, or EGFR (varying from 24.4% of expression
of HR, 20% for HER2 and 40% for EGFR) while only the
HER2 positive CTCs prevail after adjuvant treatment57.
Deeper understanding on breast cancer CTCs comes
from the evidence that this cell population expresses
both epithelial (keratins, EpCAM, and cadherin 1) and
mesenchymal markers (cadherin 2, fibronectin, and serpin
peptidase inhibitor), suggesting that they might be subject
to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) reprogramming.
Anyway, the most represented subgroup of CTCs
expresses mesenchymal markers therefore confirming
that EMT plays a pivotal role in their generation58. This is
highly remarkable considering that CTCs in breast cancer
correlate with metastasis development, and that EMT is
highly associated to the development of a metastatic
disease from a clinical point of view59. CTCs do represent
a causative biologic event for the insurgence of metastasis
also in the context of brain metastasis, where they show a
distinctive “breast cancer brain metastasis gene signature”
and can be utilized as predictive biomarkers of this clin￾ical event60.
As abovementioned, a liquid biopsy does not only rely
on the evaluation of CTCs. The secretion of proteins from
tumor cells has been investigated through label-free
quantitative proteomics approaches on plasma samples.

Tumoral secretomes are highly abundant in plasma since
cancer cells are much more prone to shedding and
releasing their content into the bloodstream, as compared
to healthy cells. The study of secreted proteins through
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry com￾bined to RNA sequencing approaches, has been proven to
be able to distinguish among breast cancer phenotypes
with different prognosis, and proved to be a valuable
strategy for outcome prediction61–64. Proteogenomics
approaches such as the one described were further vali￾dated in a larger study conducted on 105 annotated breast
cancer genomes, allowing to describe some genomic
alterations through a more mechanistic perspective. This
is the case of the loss of 5q chromosome, which is a fre￾quent finding in basal-like breast carcinomas, that led to
the identification of the loss of CETN3 and SPK1 corre￾lating with higher expression of EGFR65.
Proteins are not only secreted in the bloodstream, they
can also be incorporated within tumor-derived extra￾cellular vesicles, together with other components such as
DNA or RNA. In breast cancer, the role of ECVs has been
explored in a mouse model, showing that ECVs target
bone marrow CD11+ cells, impairing their differentiation
into dendritic cells, leading to the establishment of a pro￾metastatic niche, through the production of IL-666. One of
the components of tumor derived ECVs is represented by
miRNAs. Circulating miRNAs are a highly heterogeneous
compartment of the circulating RNA and their evaluation
is quite difficult in plasma but, on the counterpart, they
are enriched in ECVs. This has been demonstrated on a
mouse model of orthotopic xenografts from a breast
tumor, showing a high concentration of miR-1246 in
ECVs, and confirmed in vesicles isolated from breast
cancer patients, correlating with patients’ likelihood of
developing recurrencies of the disease67. Many other
circulating miRNAs and in general noncoding RNAs have
been correlated with breast cancer prognosis, miR-34a
being significantly downregulated in breast cancer com￾pared to healthy controls68–71.
The other abundant tumor-derived circulating compo￾nent derived from a liquid biopsy is represented by the
ctDNA. In the specific case of breast cancer, ctDNA has
Fig. 2 Integrated multiomics approaches in the natural history of breast cancer. Liquid biopsies can capture the complex tumoral genomic and
proteomic landscape all along tumor evolution as they can be periodically be repeated due to their relative low harmfulness. This might be of crucial
importance and will allow developing early diagnostic tools to detect localized breast cancers, as well as to develop decisional algorithms for the
selection of the best therapy at the right moment. All the information acquired will also lead to the identification of precise predictive biomarkers for
monitoring the phases of the disease, as well as for the prediction of cancer recurrence. All together, these data will generate e fast and reactive
precision medicine approach for the treatment of breast cancer. Picture created with Biorender.com.

been correlated to patients’ relapse after surgery and
adjuvant treatment, predicting it one to two years before
the clinical evidence of the metastatic disease, also cor￾relating with the disease burden72. Moreover, ctDNA has
been shown to correlate to tumor dynamics in breast
cancer patients undergoing surgical or medical therapy73,
and to be a valuable screening methodology for the
selection of breast cancer patients for a specific target
drug treatment74,75.
Some methodological limitations are still embedded in
the liquid biopsies per se. The elements that can be
analyzed form a liquid biopsy, especially in the case of
ctDNA, still need to be paired to the genomic sequencing
of the primary tumor. ctDNA sequencing relies on small
circulating fragments which are very diluted among the
normal circulating DNA, and therefore represent an
impure source of information. Furthermore, in the case of
a metastatic disease it is still difficult to assess polyclonal
versus monoclonal seeding due to the still ineffective
bioinformatics tools available76.
Liquid biopsies in neuroblastoma
Despite relatively rare neuroblastoma (NB) represents a
significant clinical problem at pediatric age, accounting
for a significant fraction (approximately 10%) of death
from children malignancies. Originated from sympathetic
nervous system, NB represents the most frequent extra￾cranial tumor in children. Stratification of patients can be
conducted on the basis of age at the diagnosis, Interna￾tional Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage, the
MYCN status, Shimada histopathology, and ploidy,
defining three well discriminated groups of low, inter￾mediated, and high risk77. Genomic abnormalities have
indeed been sufficiently defined and linked to the clinical
presentation; deletions on chromosomes 1p, 11q, or gains
on 17q2,3 are examples of effective prognostic markers of
the clinical outcome, despite the molecular basis of
their contribution to the pathogenesis are not entirely
clear78–81. Moreover, neuronal differentiation markers
such as p73 have also been associated to the pathogenesis
of the disease82–84, while the amplification of the proto￾oncogene MYCN is another clear predictor of disease
severity, therapy resistance and poor clinical outcome.
Less than 50% of NB patients with MYCN amplification
reach 5-year survival, on contrary of the 90% of non-MYC
patients21,64,85,86.
Diagnostic procedures for NB largely rely on radio￾graphic body imaging, nuclear medicine examination,
evaluation of serum levels of neuron-specific enzymes
(enolase and lactate dehydrogenase) or urinary levels of
vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid
(HVA). Sensitivity of these techniques is however low to
represent proper early detection methods. Their diag￾nostic value emerges indeed quite late when the cancer
has developed into clinical stage and discrete lumps
evident.
Detection of cell free DNA (cfDNA) for NB could
improve effectiveness of diagnostic methods and toler￾ability of medical procedure especially at young age of the
patients which are generally involved in this. Detection of
MYCN DNA by PCR in the peripheral blood was firstly
reported in 2002. Those early data indicated that data the
release of MYCN DNA in the blood circulation is an early
process in disease, thus offering a potential novel marker
for patient follow-up after treatment87. Further refine￾ment studies introduced NAGK as a reference gene to
quantify MYCN copy number as an MYCN/NAGK (M/
N) ratio, providing a more accurate assessment of MYCN
status88. Subsequent studies have however reduced the
optimism, as sensitivity on patients with NB of INSS
stages 1 and 2 appeared to be significantly lower than the
core biopsy analyses89,90. Another putative biomarker is
the serum detection of ALK DNA. ALK is a tyrosine
kinase receptor subjected to copy number amplification in
25% of NB cases, and some instance mutations in ALK
sequence have also been observed. Detection of ALK
circulating DNA has therefore been explored to achieve
approaches to monitor relapse and predict drug resis￾tance. For example, F1174 and R1275 mutations appear to
be effectively detected with high specificity and sensitivity
in the peripheral blood of a cohort of NB patients91.
Additional effort has been placed in development of
methods to detect chromosomal variations and DNA
methylation in liquid biopsies from NB patients. Good
concordance between primary tumor and liquid biopsies
has been revealed in detection of several chromosomal
variations (11q, 17q, and 1p), it is however still missing a
reliable large-scale clinical trial reporting substantial evi￾dence to support shift of diagnostic procedures to
detection of cfDNA. At the present, clinical practise
therefore relies on histopathology and molecular char￾acterization of tumor tissue63,92,93. However, unfeasibility
of multiple resections, irregular interval between mor￾bidity and acquisition of diagnostic material and ambig￾uous interpretations of pathology samples are just some of
the substantial drawbacks of these classic procedures.
Conclusions
Oncology has undoubtedly entered the precision medi￾cine era with the technological ability to characterize a
single cancer from multiomics approaches. This possibi￾lity can be exploited also thanks to some major advances
in artificial intelligence algorithms, that are essential for
deciphering much of the information embedded in the
omics data. Anyhow, this huge amount of biologic details
does not readily and dynamically translate into the clinical
practice, since it is usually performed on the cancer tissue
itself, that is normally taken one (or a very few times)

during individual cancer history. This limitation does not
only regard time, but also capturing tumor heterogeneity.
The improvement of our understanding of cancer biology,
with the discovery that tumoral material circulates in the
bloodstream in form of CTCs, ctDNA, or ctRNA, EVCs,
has given the opportunity to conceive the idea that blood
itself might represent a cancer biopsy per se. Under this
light, liquid biopsies can overcome many limitations of
tissue biopsies and could capture tumor heterogeneity in a
whole, thanks to the improvement of both omics tech￾nologies and the associated artificial intelligence elabora￾tion of the data, but mostly can capture tumor evolution
without being invasive to the patients. This will be soon
translated into a more precise prognostic evaluation and a
best treatment selection designed on a single patient’s
disease during its evolution, leading to a true precision
medicine approach.
