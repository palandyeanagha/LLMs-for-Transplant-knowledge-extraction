Adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) is caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 has elaborated strategies to
persist and replicate in the presence of a strong immune response. In this review, we summarise these mechanisms and their
contribution to T-cell transformation and ATL development.

Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) belongs to the
Deltaretrovirus genera of the Orthoretrovirinae subfamily. HTLV-1
is the first discovered human retrovirus, isolated in the early 1980s
from peripheral blood samples of a patient with cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma (Poiesz et al, 1980). Even if the exact number of
sero-positive individuals is not known, an estimated 20 million
people would be infected with HTLV-1 worldwide (de The and
Kazanji, 1996). HTLV-1 is endemic in the Caribbean, Southern
Japan, Africa, South America and Pacific islands. HTLV-1 is also
present in Europe and North America where infection is epidemic.
HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of an aggressive leukaemia, called
adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) as well as inflammatory
disorders including tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated
myelopathy (TSP/HAM), arthritis, uveitis, dermatitis, lymphadenitis
and Sjo¨gren’s syndrome (Proietti et al, 2005). In addition to
HTLV-1, other members of the Deltatretovirus genus are HTLV-2,
-3 and -4 as well as bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). HTLV-2 was
identified in cell lines derived from a patient with atypical hairy
cell leukaemia although further studies failed to confirm the
association of HTLV-2 with lymphoproliferative diseases. HTLV-3
and -4 subtypes have recently been identified in bushmeat hunters
in Central Africa; infection by these two viruses being presently
not associated to any pathology (Mahieux and Gessain, 2005). BLV
is the causative agent of a B-cell neoplastic disease in cattle
(reviewed by Gillet et al, 2007).
Most HTLV-1 carriers remain infected lifelong without developing
any major clinical manifestation. After several decades, only
a small proportion (2.1% for females and 6.6% for males) of
HTLV-1-infected subjects will progress to ATL. The term ATL
includes a spectrum of diseases that are referred to as smoldering,
chronic, lymphoma and acute. ATL patients have atypical
lymphoid cells with multilobulated nuclei (so-called flower cells)
in their peripheral blood. ATL cells are consistently monoclonal
with respect to proviral integration and originate from initial
polyclonal/oligoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells.
Leukaemia may progress from a smouldering phase to chronic
and acute clinical manifestations. Acute and lymphoma subtypes
show aggressive and rapidly fatal clinical courses with a median
survival time of about 1 year. Although tumour cells are sensitive
to conventional chemotherapy, patients rapidly relapse and
become resistant to further treatment. Chronic and smouldering
stages have a more indolent course and do not require
chemotherapy (Proietti et al, 2005).
HTLV-1-ENCODED PROTEINS
Despite a relatively small genome (9 kb), HTLV-1 expresses
multiple gene products by using both strands of its proviral
genome and complex events of mRNA splicing (Figure 1). The
HTLV-1 genome contains typical structural and enzymatic genes
(gag, pro, pol and env) flanked by two long terminal repeats
(LTRs). The long terminal repeats (LTR) are subdivided into three
regions (i.e., U3, R and U5) that contain the cis-acting elements
essential for viral gene expression: transcription factor-binding
sites, transcription start and termination sites, polyadenylation
and splicing sites. A region called pX, which is located between the
env gene and the 30
-LTR, contains at least four partially
overlapping reading frames (ORFs) encoding accessory proteins
(p12I
, p13II, p30II), the post-transcriptional regulator REX (ORF
III) and the TAX transactivator (ORF IV). In addition, HBZ is
encoded from the 30 LTR in the complementary strand of the
genome (Gaudray et al, 2002). Among all these regulatory proteins,
TAX and HBZ proteins appear to have particularly important
roles in viral persistence and pathogenesis, presumably through
stimulation of continuous cell growth of infected cells in the
presence of a strong immune surveillance.
TAX
TAX (p40) activates viral transcription by interacting with
triplicate enhancer elements (TxRE) located in the 50
-LTR. TAX
is also a major factor mediating viral persistence and disease
development. The oncogenic potential of TAX is supported by its
ability to immortalise cells in vitro, stimulate colony formation in
soft agar and produce tumours in transgenic mouse models.
Within the cell, TAX exerts its functions by complex formation

with more than a hundred cellular proteins (Boxus et al, 2008). We
recently proposed that the intrinsically disordered structure of
TAX allows a wide variety of conformational changes enabling
binding diversity and recognition of differently shaped protein
partners. Thereby, TAX triggers a plethora of cell-signalling
pathways, reprograms the cell cycle, interferes with checkpoint
control and inhibits DNA repair. The recent observation that TAX
also modulates the miRNAs environment adds another level of
complexity to its biological functions (Bouzar and Willems, 2008).
Altogether, these pleiotropic activities of TAX cooperate to
promote infected T-cell proliferation, generate DNA abnormalities
and lead to subsequent transformation.
Among cellular pathways activated by TAX, CREB/ATF, NF-kB
and AP1 are thought to have predominant roles in T-cell
proliferation and transformation. Molecular mechanisms sustain￾ing these TAX activities have been reviewed recently (Boxus et al,
2008). Depending on the model, TAX mutants defective for the
activation of these pathways are poorly oncogenic both in vitro
and in vivo. For example, TAX-mediated NF-kb activation
stimulates expression of cytokines and their receptors such as
interleukin 2 (IL2)/IL2 receptor (IL2R), IL9, IL13 and IL15/IL15R
as well as members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor family.
Thereby, TAX provides stimulatory signals resulting from the
binding of ligands to their receptors and promotes cell prolifera￾tion as well as the initiation and maintenance of transformation
(Grassmann et al, 2005; Sun and Yamaoka, 2005).
Besides stimulation of cell growth through signal transduction,
TAX also directly subverts cell cycle progression by protein –
protein interaction and transcriptional regulation of cell cycle￾associated proteins. A major activity of TAX is stimulation of G1/S
transition (Marriott and Semmes, 2005). Mechanistically, TAX
increases the levels of type D cyclins in G1 and activates cyclin￾dependent kinases (i.e., CDK4 and CDK6) through direct binding,
leading to hyperphosphorylation of Rb, subsequent release of E2F
transcription factor and accelerated transition from G1 to S. TAX
also directly interacts with and promotes proteasomal degradation
of Rb. Furthermore, TAX modulates expression of CDK inhibitors
such as p18INK4c, p19INK4d, p21WAF1 and p27KIP1 and inactivates
p15INK4b and p16INK4a through direct binding (Grassmann et al,
2005), thereby restraining their inhibitory activity toward CDKs.
Finally, owing to its PDZ-binding domain (PBM), TAX interacts
with hDLG, which binds to the adenomatous polyposis complex
(APC) tumour suppressor and enforces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. To
override regulatory functions of hDLG, TAX induces its hyperpho￾sphorylation (Boxus et al, 2008). It is noteworthy that TAX
mutants lacking the PBM are also impaired in immortalisation and
transformation in vitro and in vivo (Xie et al, 2006).
REX, p12, p13 and p30
REX (p27) is an RNA-binding post-transcriptional regulator that
binds specifically to its cis-acting target sequence, the Rex response
element (RRE), located at the 30
-end of sense viral mRNAs. REX
promotes the export of the unspliced and singly spliced viral RNA
species from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and inhibits splicing and
transport of doubly spliced RNAs from the pX region (Kashanchi
and Brady, 2005).
The four accessory proteins (p12I
, p13II, p21II, p30II) are
encoded by different pX mRNAs formed by alternative splicing
events. p12 localises to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
regulates calcium-dependent signalling thereby activating nuclear
factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) (Nicot et al, 2005). p12 also
increases STAT5 transcriptional activity by interacting with the
interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R). In addition, p12 interferes with
MHC class I presentation by translocating newly synthesized MHC
class I heavy chains towards the proteasome. An 8-kDa proteolytic
cleavage form of p12 traffics to the cell surface, is recruited to the
immunologic synapse following T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, and
downregulates TCR proximal signalling (Fukumoto et al, 2009).
These multiple functions of p12 are thus likely to promote viral
escape of immune surveillance as well as T-cell proliferation.
p30 is involved in the nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA
leading to inhibition of virus expression and establishment of
viral latency (Baydoun et al, 2008). In addition, p30 modulates
expression of cellular genes involved in T-cell activation, apoptosis
and cell cycle regulation through complex formation with p300/
CBP and TIP60 (Nicot et al, 2005).
A truncated form of p30, p13 localises in mitochondria and
alters membrane potential as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production (Silic-Benussi et al, 2009). On the other hand, p13
binds to farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), an enzyme
required for the prenylation of Ras (Lefebvre et al, 2002).
HBZ
The recently identified HBZ (HTLV-1 bZIP) factor acts as a
negative regulator of TAX-mediated viral transactivation by
heterodimerising with CREB, CREB2 and p300/CBP (Clerc et al,
2008). HBZ also modulates AP1 pathway by interacting with c-Jun,
JunB and JunD. Similarly to TAX, HBZ interacts with proteasome
subunits and may favour the delivery of cellular factors (e.g.,
c-Jun) towards the proteasome even in the absence of ubiquitina￾tion (Isono et al, 2008). Expression of the HBZ RNA leads to
upregulation of E2F1 target genes and stimulates T-lymphocyte
proliferation (Satou et al, 2006). Inversely, silencing of HBZ with
shRNA decreases proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells and
their ability to form solid tumours in mice (Arnold et al, 2008).
VIRAL TRANSMISSION AND PERSISTENCE
Although HTLV-1 infects many cell types in vitro, its preferential
tropism in vivo includes CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-lymphocytes and
dendritic cells. The ubiquitous glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1),
neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPGs) are cell surface receptors for HTLV-1 and are required for
efficient entry (Takenouchi et al, 2007).
Transmission of HTLV-1 occurs through transfer of infected
cells: from mother to child during breast-feeding, via sexual
intercourse and through exposure to infected blood products or
sharing of needles and syringes (Proietti et al, 2005). Cell-free
HTLV-1 virions, which are not detected in the serum of infected
subjects with currently available techniques, are indeed poorly
infectious (Asquith and Bangham, 2008). Efficient transmission
would thus rather rely on direct cell-to-cell contact, polarization of
microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) which is triggered by TAX
and formation of a virological synapse allowing the entry of viral
proteins and genomic RNA into a new target T lymphocyte
(Majorovits et al, 2008). Similarly to HIV, HTLV-1 also efficiently
infects dendritic cells (DC) that subsequently transmit the virus to

CD4 þ T-cells in a biphasic manner (Jones et al, 2008). During the
first day after viral exposure, DCs capture and transfer virions to
CD4 þ T cells (trans-infection). At later times, T cells are primarily
infected by transmission of de novo-produced virus from infected
DCs (cis-infection).
How HTLV-1 persists indefinitely in the infected hosts despite
the presence of an active immune response is still intriguing.
The current views about this apparent paradox postulates
that virus rarely replicates via the infectious route but rather
through mitosis of infected cells (Asquith and Bangham, 2008).
As described in the previous paragraph, accessory and regulatory
viral proteins are able to stimulate cell cycle progression thereby
maintaining viral load in the host. Measurement of lymphocyte
dynamics in HTLV-1-infected subjects shows that T-cell prolifera￾tion is increased compared with controls. This proliferative burst
is correlated with the expression of viral proteins ex vivo (Asquith
and Bangham, 2008). A recent study also reveals that the virus
preferentially integrates into transcriptionally active genomic
regions allowing favoured expression of viral proteins in vivo
(Meekings et al, 2008).
Inoculation of HTLV-1 molecular clones in a rabbit model
reveals that regulatory and accessory proteins (i.e., p12, p13 and
p30) are required for efficient infectivity, viral spread and
persistence in vivo (Matsuoka and Jeang, 2007). In contrast to
TAX and HBZ, these accessory proteins, despite having an
important role, are very poorly expressed in HTLV-1 infected
cells isolated from patients. TAX has been dogmatically considered
to be the main and only viral factor promoting persistence and
pathogenesis but, recently, compelling evidences indicate that HBZ
is clearly another key mediator. Out of the rabbit model, it appears
that tax/rex and gag/pol mRNA levels peak early after infection and
then progressively decrease. Conversely, hbz mRNA is detected
later but increases over time. In primary T-cells isolated from
asymptomatic carriers or ATL patients, hbz mRNA is highly
expressed whereas rex/tax mRNAs are poorly, or not at all,
detectable. Moreover, during ATL progression, the 50
LTR but not
the 30 LTR is frequently deleted or methylated, thereby overcoming
TAX expression. Actually, TAX is a major target of cytotoxic
T-cells and elicits a strong immune response that counterbalances
infected cell propagation. In contrast, although HBZ is an
immunogenic protein, HBZ-specific CTLs seem unable to effi￾ciently eliminate HTLV-1-infected cells (Suemori et al, 2009).
A feedback loop coordinates TAX and HBZ expression: TAX
activates HBZ, which, in turn, represses TAX-mediated transacti￾vation. HBZ might thus prevent exaggerated TAX expression and
allow infected cells to evade an immune response. Paradoxically,
TAX expression is required to promote infected cell proliferation
and viral persistence, through release of E2F factor and enforced
G1/S transition. However, the ability of hbz mRNA to upregulate
E2F1 gene transcription might supplant TAX-mediated release of
E2F to promote continuous cell proliferation in latter steps of viral
persistence (Satou et al, 2006).
Altogether, these data thus indicate that (1) HTLV-1 persistence
relies on a subtle equilibrium regulated by the expression
of viral proteins stimulating cell-growth in infected cells and
their elimination by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes; (2) TAX and HBZ
cooperate to promote infected cell proliferation in the early and
late steps of infection and (3) silencing of viral expression allow
escape from immune response.
ROLE OF GENOMIC INSTABILITIES IN
TRANSFORMATION
Why only a small fraction of infected subjects will develop an ATL
still remains an unanswered question. It is likely that continuous
replication of HTLV-1 and promotion of cell proliferation
ultimately leads to genomic instability and generates chromosomal
abnormalities, a characteristic hallmark of ATL cells. Among
regulatory proteins, TAX promotes infected T-cell transformation
in vitro and in vivo. TAX has both clastogenic and aneuploidic
effects that are thought to contribute to its oncogenic potential
(Matsuoka and Jeang, 2007; Boxus et al, 2008).
Through its interaction with TAX1BP2 and RanBP1, TAX
induces supernumerary centrosomes and causes multipolar
mitosis, a common cause of aneuploidy. TAX also promotes
unscheduled degradation of securin and cyclin B1 by interacting
with CDC20-associated anaphase-promoting complex (APC). This
process can lead to faulty chromosome segregation and ensuing
aneuploidy. Mammalian cells have evolved the mitotic spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) that is the guardian of genome
euploidy. TAX binds to MAD1, an integral constituent of the
SAC machinery, and impairs its activity. TAX thus promotes
aneuploidy by interacting with proteins that monitor chromo￾somal segregation during mitosis (Matsuoka and Jeang, 2007).
How TAX induces clastogenic DNA damage is far from being
well understood. On one hand, TAX represses expression of
DNA polymerase-b that is involved in base excision repair and
inhibits nucleotide excision repair induced by UV irradiation
(Marriott and Semmes, 2005). On the other hand, TAX represses
expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) and subverts Ku80 activity, thereby reducing protection
from double-strand breaks (DSB) as well as telomere extension
(Matsuoka and Jeang, 2007). This mechanism could explain
why chromosome end-to-end fusions are frequently observed in
HTLV-1-infected cells.

Figure 2 Role of TAX and HBZ in viral persistence and ATL
development. In asymptomatic carriers, TAX stimulates viral and cellular
gene expression, thereby promoting T-cell proliferation and allowing viral
replication. The host immune response efficiently destroys most lympho￾cytes expressing viral antigens and selects for cells lacking or expressing low
levels of TAX. Infected cell proliferation is then progressively promoted by
HBZ, another viral factor encoded by the complementary strand. Forced
and sustained cell replication by TAX generates DNA damage that
activates checkpoints, a second barrier to transformation. In rare cases, this
barrier may be breached through checkpoint adaptation mechanisms,
allowing fixation of growth promoting mutations and subsequent ATL
development.

When cells undergo DNA damage, a complex network of
signalling molecules, the DNA damage response (DDR), is
activated. The DDR signalling network is often constitutively
activated in premalignant lesions. This pathway is orchestrated by
ATM, ATR and DNA-PK kinases whose substrates (e.g., CHK1, -2,
p53, H2AX, 53BP1) delay cell cycle progression, promote DNA
repair or even elicit permanent proliferative arrest (i.e., senes￾cence) and apoptosis in case of extended, irreparable, DNA
lesions. De novo TAX expression causes checkpoint activation
and cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle,
consistent with the fact that TAX triggers genome instability
(Marriott and Semmes, 2005). Our unpublished data indicate
that TAX-dependent acceleration of the cell cycle induces
replicative DNA damage resulting in constitutive DDR pathway
activation in TAX-transformed cells as well as in T lympho￾cytes isolated from ATL patients (Boxus M and Willems L,
unpublished data).
Growth arrest and apoptosis controlled by the DDR pathway
may appear contradictory with the ability of the virus to sustain
continuous cell proliferation. Nevertheless, permanent activation
of DDR signalling creates a selection pressure that may be
breached by cells deficient for ATM, CHK2, p53 or 53BP1 (Bartek
et al, 2007). This mechanism, termed checkpoint adaptation, may
allow HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate with DNA damage,
experience genetic instability and ultimately evolve to ATL clones.
Although only a small percentage of ATL patients have genomic
p53 mutations, the TAX protein interferes with the DDR pathway
through inactivation of p53 (for a review see (Tabakin-Fix et al,
2006)). TAX also restricts activity of ATM, DNA – PK, CHK1 and
CHK2-mediated checkpoints at G1 or G2/M (Marriott and
Semmes, 2005; Chandhasin et al, 2008; Durkin et al, 2008). As a
result, TAX limits cell cycle arrest induced by exogenous DNA￾damaging agents. Therefore, it is anticipated that TAX counteracts
the DDR pathway activation induced by its own DNA damage,
resulting in checkpoint adaptation and fixation of genomic
alteration. Such a model thus provides a rationale for genomic
damage in ATL cells.
CONCLUSIONS
HTLV-1 has developed sophisticated mechanisms to ensure
persistence and, perhaps as a bystander effect, pathogenesis
in vivo (Figure 2). As infection of new target cells is inefficient,
viral replication occurs mainly through mitotic division of provirus
carrying lymphocytes. HTLV-1 regulatory factors such as TAX and
HBZ allow favoured proliferation of infected cells. HBZ, p12 and p30
either reduce viral expression or inhibit immune recognition.
Permanent TAX-induced proliferation and abnormal expansion of
infected cells generate DNA lesions characteristic of ATL. Inhibition
of host checkpoint machinery allows further proliferation of
infected cells harbouring DNA damage. Progressive stabilisation of
these abnormalities provides an increased proliferative capacity to
the infected cells and ultimately leads to ATL.
