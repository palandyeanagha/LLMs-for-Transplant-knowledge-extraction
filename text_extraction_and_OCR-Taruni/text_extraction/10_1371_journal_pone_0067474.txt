Abstract
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) raises blood pressure and can reduce kidney function. Revascularization of the
stenotic renal artery alone does not restore renal medullary structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that
addition of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) can restore stenotic￾kidney medullary tubular transport function and attenuate its remodeling. Twenty-seven swine were divided into three
ARAS (high-cholesterol diet and renal artery stenosis) and a normal control group. Six weeks after ARAS induction, two
groups were treated with PTRA alone or PTRA supplemented with adipose-tissue-derived MSC (106106 cells intra-renal).
Multi-detector computed tomography and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI studies were performed 4
weeks later to assess kidney hemodynamics and function, and tissue collected a few days later for histology and micro-CT
imaging. PTRA effectively decreased blood pressure, yet medullary vascular density remained low. Addition of MSC
improved medullary vascularization in ARAS+PTRA+MSC and increased angiogenic signaling, including protein expression
of vascular endothelial growth-factor, its receptor (FLK-1), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a. ARAS+PTRA+MSC also showed
attenuated inflammation, although oxidative-stress remained elevated. BOLD-MRI indicated that MSC normalized oxygen￾dependent tubular response to furosemide (-4.360.9, 20.160.4, 21.660.9 and 23.661.0 s21 in Normal, ARAS, ARAS+PTRA
and ARAS+PTRA+MSC, respectively, p,0.05), which correlated with a decrease in medullary tubular injury score (R2 = 0.33,
p = 0.02). Therefore, adjunctive MSC delivery in addition to PTRA reduces inflammation, fibrogenesis and vascular
remodeling, and restores oxygen-dependent tubular function in the stenotic-kidney medulla, although additional
interventions might be required to reduce oxidative-stress. This study supports development of cell-based strategies for
renal protection in ARAS.

Introduction
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) remains among the
most prevalent and important causes of secondary hypertension,
and can accelerate renal injury towards fibrosis [1,2]. Previous
studies have shown that restoration of blood flow to the stenotic
kidney by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in
patients with ARAS often fails to restore renal function [3,4,5]
likely due to ongoing tissue injury, microvascular loss, and
inflammation [4]. Therefore, adjunct therapies that decrease
inflammation, promote angiogenesis, and attenuate tissue damage
in the post-stenotic kidney hold the potential to enhance the
outcome of PTRA in ARAS [6,7]. However, renal injury is often
evaluated in the entire kidney, which reflects mainly the renal
cortex [7,8,9], whereas relatively little is known about the
reversibility of medullary damage. We have recently shown that
PTRA alone does not fully reverse medullary tissue damage in
post-stenotic kidney [10]. We have further shown that intra-renal
delivery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) combined with
PTRA in a model of non-atherosclerotic RAS decreases medullary
fibrosis and improves tubular transport function [10]. Neverthe￾less, even in that model with less damaged kidneys, EPC adjunct
with PTRA did not restore medullary microvascular density or
blood flow, possibly as a result of insufficient upregulation of
angiogenic signaling.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are undifferentiated non￾embryonic stem cells that can be isolated from a variety of tissues,
and possess the ability to differentiate into a broad spectrum of cell
lineages [11,12]. In comparison to EPC, we have shown that MSC
exhibit similar angiogenic properties, but greater anti-inflamma￾tory properties [13]. Previous studies have shown in several kidney
injury models that MSC promote tubular regeneration, and
reduce inflammation and vascular injury [7,11,12,14,15]. In the
cortex of ARAS pigs, we observed that MSC reduced oxidative
stress, increased vascularity, and restored renal blood flow (RBF)

and bioavailability of nitric oxide. Additionally, several studies
have demonstrated that MSC up-regulated the expression level of
anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and
attenuate renal fibrosis [12,16]. These properties could potentially
enhance their therapeutic efficacy compared to EPC. However,
the ability of adjunct MSC, in addition to PTRA, to improve the
function and the structure of the renal medulla has not yet been
shown. Thus, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that in
ARAS, adjunct MSC delivery during PTRA would improve
medullary fibrosis, inflammation, tubular function, and microvas￾cular density.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal procedures followed the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, National
Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996) and were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Twenty-seven female domestic pigs (48.361.5 kg) were studied
for 16 weeks. Twenty of the animals were fed a high-cholesterol
diet (to generate atherosclerosis) for the entire course of the study,
starting six weeks before until ten weeks after induction of the
stenosis. Unilateral ARAS was induced in these pigs by placing an
irritant coil in one main renal artery [17,18]. On the same day, a
PhysioTel telemetry transducer (Data Science International,
Arden Hills, MN, USA) was implanted in the femoral artery,
and thereafter, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was continuously
monitored and recorded. ARAS animals were randomized in
three groups and six weeks later the degree of stenosis in each
animal was determined using renal angiography. An untreated
ARAS group (n = 7) underwent a sham procedure, and the other
thirteen underwent PTRA and stenting under fluoroscopic
guidance using a balloon-expandable stent [7,19]. In addition, in
the revascularized group, animals received after PTRA intra-renal
infusion of either vehicle (n = 7) or adipose-tissue-derived MSC
(n = 6, 106106 cells) over 5 min. Another group of pigs, fed with
regular diet, underwent only sham procedures (angiography, saline
infusion) and served as normal controls (n = 7).
Stenotic kidney function and oxygenation were determined four
weeks later using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT)
and blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), respectively. Prior to each in vivo study animals
were anesthetized (Telazol 5 mg/kg and xylazine 2 mg/kg in
saline), and anesthesia maintained with intravenous ketamine
(0.2 mg/kg/min) and xylazine (0.03 mg/kg/min) (for CT), or
inhaled 1–2% isoflurane (for MRI) throughout the course of
imaging. BOLD images were collected before and 15 minutes after
injection of furosemide (0.5 mg/kg) through an ear vein cannula.
The BOLD index, R2*, at baseline and its change after
furosemide, DR2*, were used as measures of tissue oxygenation
and furosemide-suppressible oxygen-dependent tubular function,
respectively [20].
Using contrast-enhanced MDCT, renal function was evaluated
3–4 days later in anesthetized pigs to calculate cortical and
medullary volumes, regional renal perfusion, glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) and RBF [21,22].
Animals were euthanized with a lethal intravenous dose of
sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) a few days after the in vivo
studies. Then the kidneys were removed and immersed in saline
solution containing heparin. A lobe of tissue was perfused and
prepared for micro-CT and another lobe was shock-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC or preserved in formalin for
histology.
Mesenchymal Stem Cells Preparation
Allogeneic MSC were collected and cultured from swine
omentum fat (10 g), digested in collagenase-H for 45 min, filtered,
and cultured in EGM-2 media for about 3 weeks [7]. The 3rd
passage was collected and kept for up to 6 months in Gibco Cell

Culture Freezing Medium (Life Technologies Co., Carlsbad, CA)
at 280uC for transplantation. Cellular phenotype was examined
in vitro with immuno-fluorescent staining of MSC positive for
CD90, CD44, and CD105 and negative for CD14 and CD45, and
cells were labeled with red fluorescent CM-DiI prior to injection,
and 106 cells/mL suspended in 10 mL of PBS. The immune￾modulatory properties of MSC afforded the use of allogeneic cells
with little concern about rejection [23].
BOLD Imaging
BOLD imaging was performed on a 3T scanner (GE Medical
Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) using Fast Gradient Echo
sequence with multiple echo times. Four to seven slices were
collected axially in oblique planes using 16 echoes and MR
parameters set to TR/TE/Flip Angle/FOV/Slice thickness/
Matrix = 100 ms, 2.1–27 ms, 40u, 32 cm, 7 mm, 2566256. Entire
acquisitions were performed during suspended respiration.
MDCT Imaging
Contrast media injections during scanning were performed
through a pigtail catheter, advanced through the left jugular vein
to the superior vena cava. Following catheterization, the animals
were moved to MDCT unit (Somatom Sensation 64; Siemens
Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany). Initial tomographic
positioning was determined with pilot scans. A bolus of iopamidol
(0.5 ml/kg over 2 s) was then injected, and 140 consecutive scans
acquired 3 seconds later, over approximately 3 minutes, as
previously shown [7,8,9,10].

ARAS+PTRA, but tubular oxygen-dependent function was restored in ARAS+PTRA+MSC (C) (*p#0.05 vs. Normal, #p#0.05 ARAS+PTRA+MSC).

Following the flow scan a volume study was performed after an
additional contrast injection. Axial images were acquired at helical
acquisition with thickness of 0.6 mm and resolution of 5126512,
and reconstructed at 5 mm thickness. Kidney volumes were
calculated from contrast-enhanced vascular phase images.
Micro-CT for Microvascular Architecture
To prepare tissue for micro-CT imaging, the segmental renal
artery perfusing a kidney lobe was cannulated ex-vivo and infused
initially with heparin-saline (10 U/mL) and next by radio-opaque
silicon polymer (Microfil, FlowTech, Carver, MA). Infusion was
performed at the rate of 0.8 ml/min and under physiological
pressure. Finally tissue was cut into small cubes, and scanning
performed at 20 mm voxels-resolution.
Data Analysis
All analyses were performed in AnalyzeTM (Biomedical Imaging
Resource, Mayo Clinic, MN, USA) and MATLABH (MathWork,
Natick, MA, USA).
MDCT
The volumes of the cortex and medulla were determined by
estimating the total tomographic areas of each compartment and
multiplying them by the thickness in 5 mm thick cross-sectional
images. To calculate renal function and hemodynamics, the
cortical and medullary signal attenuation vs. time curves were
fitted to an extended C-variate model. Regional blood volumes
and mean transit times were calculated to estimate cortical and
medullary perfusion and blood flows (products of perfusion and
the corresponding volumes). Total RBF was assessed as the sum of
cortical and medullary flow. Finally, GFR was evaluated using the
cortical curve and the slope of the proximal tubular curves, as
previously shown [21].
BOLD
Kidneys were sampled using entire kidney region of interest.
Pixel-by-pixel R2* maps were generated by fitting the logarithms
of the decaying MR signal against corresponding echo times and
calculating the slope. The histogram of the population of estimated
R2* values was plotted against R2* scale, and the regions
representing the cortical and medullary compartments separated,
as recently shown [24]. An average medullary R2* was calculated,
and the difference between the baseline and post-furosemide R2*
values, DR2*, was used as a quantitative measure of oxygen￾dependent tubular transport.
Micro-CT
Using AnalyzeTM, micro-CT images were presented as 3-
dimensional volumes of the microvasculature. Medullary micro￾vascular density (vascular volume fraction) was calculated by
dividing the contrast-agent filled vasa recta volume, calculated
from micro-CT images, by the volume of the entire region of outer
medulla containing these microvessels [10], using 100–200,
20 mm-thick cross-sectional slices.
MSC Localization
MSC, labeled with CM-DiI prior to the injection, were tracked
in frozen 5 mm thick cross-sectional slices under fluorescence
microscopy. To determine the location of engraftments, DAPI
(nuclear stain) and cytokeratin (tubular marker) co-stains were
used. MSC were counted both in the cortex and medulla in low
power fields. The engraftment ratio in the medulla to the cortex
was calculated, as shown before [7].
Kidney Tissue Studies
Frozen medullary tissue was isolated, and standard Western
blotting protocols were performed by pulverizing and homoge￾nizing it in chilled protein extraction buffer. The lysate was used
for immunoblotting against swine specific antibodies for vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (dilution 1:200), VEGF receptor
(FLK-1) (dilution 1:200), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a
(dilution 1:500), NAD(P)H-oxidase p47 (dilution 1:200), matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (dilution 1:500), IL-10 (dilution 1:500),
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (dilution 1:200), to investigate
mechanisms involved in renal neovascularization, tubular oxygen
consumption, fibrogenesis and inflammation. GAPDH served as a
loading control, except for MMP-2 expression, which was
quantified by normalizing the active to pro-MMP.
Renal vascularization, fibrosis and inflammation mediators
were also quantified in 5 mm slides stained for H&E, trichrome,
CD68, CD163+ macrophages, Arginase (Arg)-1 (a marker of
trophic M2 macrophages) and monocyte chemotactic protein
(MCP)-1, and oxidative stress in 30 mm dihydroethidium (DHE)
stained slides. Medullary capillaries, tubules and neutrophils were
counted at 1006 magnification in H&E stained slides using an
ApoTome microscope (Carl ZEISS SMT, Oberkochen, Ger￾many). Capillaries were identified by the presence of lumen, red
blood cells and/or an endothelial cell lining, and the ratio of
capillary number to tubules was calculated [25]. In addition,
microvascular density was assessed by immunoreactivity of von
Willebrand factor (vWF) in colorimetric stained slides. Tubular
injury was scored on a 1–5 scale (1: ,10%, 2:10–25%, 3:26–50%,
4:51–75% and 5: .75% injury) using 406 H&E slides based on
tubular dilation, atrophy, cast formation, sloughing tubular
endothelial cells or thickening basement membrane [26].
Statistical Analysis
Results are presented in mean6SEM format. Paired Student t￾test was used for comparisons within groups and ANOVA for
comparison among groups followed by unpaired t-test. For p
values #0.05 differences were considered significant.
Results
Six weeks after stenosis induction, the degree of stenosis in the
ARAS, ARAS+PTRA and ARAS+PTRA+MSC groups was
comparable (7767%, 7865% and 7564%, respectively) and
MAP was similarly elevated (ANOVA p = 0.42) (Table 1). Four
weeks after PTRA (residual stenosis ,10%) MAP declined in both
ARAS+PTRA and ARAS+PTRA+MSC (p = 0.0006 and
p = 0.006 vs. ARAS, respectively). Serum creatinine in ARA￾Figure 2. Medullary neovascularization and tubular injury. Medullary regions outlined in dashed-line were used to calculate vasa recta

S+PTRA remained elevated similar to ARAS, but was not
different from normal in ARAS+PTRA+MSC. Renal volume,
RBF and GFR decreased in ARAS compared to normal. In
ARAS+PTRA and ARAS+PTRA+MSC, medullary volumes were
restored to normal values, but medullary blood flow remained
lower than normal in both groups, although it tended to be higher
in ARAS+PTRA+MSC compared to ARAS+PTRA alone
(p = 0.07). PTRA alone did not improve GFR, but PTRA+MSC
restored GFR to a value not different from normal.
Medullary Tubular Oxygen-dependent Function
Basal medullary R2* values were elevated in all ARAS groups
compared to normal and tended to be higher in ARA￾S+PTRA+MSC compared to the other two ARAS groups
(Figure 1, p = 0.07 vs. ARAS and p = 0.08 vs. ARAS+PTRA).
After furosemide, the medulla remained more hypoxic than
normal in all ARAS animals, and R2* was not statistically different
among them (Figure 1A–B). The change in R2*, as a measure of
oxygen-dependent tubular transport function, indicated signifi￾cantly attenuated response in ARAS and ARAS+PTRA compared
to Normal. However, the degree of response in ARA￾S+PTRA+MSC was significantly enhanced compared to ARAS,
tended to be higher than ARAS+PTRA (p = 0.08), and was not
different from Normal (Figure 1C).
Medullary Morphology
Micro-CT revealed a decrease in vasa recta density in ARAS
and ARAS+PTRA, but not in ARAS+PTRA+MSC compared to
normal (Figure 2A, 2B). Capillary count also showed significantly
lower densities in ARAS (p,0.001 vs. normal), which tended to
remain reduced in ARAS+PTRA (p = 0.08), but was similar to
Normal in ARAS+PTRA+MSC (Figure 2.D). Moreover, medul￾Figure 3. Angiogenic factors and cell engraftment. MSC, labeled with CM-DiI (red), were localized in medullary slides co-stained with DAPI

(Figure 2F). Finally, medullary BOLD response to furosemide did
not correlate with capillary density but both showed moderate but
significant correlations with tubular injury score (Figure 1G–H).
Tissue Studies
In the stenotic kidney medulla of ARAS+PTRA+MSC, 4 weeks
after administration MSC were detected engrafted mainly in the
interstitium (Figure 3A), and their average ratio to MSC in the
cortex was approximately 1:5 [7]. Medullary expression of VEGF
and its receptor FLK-1 was increased in ARAS+PTRA+MSC
compared to ARAS and ARAS+PTRA, and tended to be higher
than normal (p = 0.07, and p = 0.08, respectively). Despite
increased angiogenic signaling in ARAS+PTRA+MSC, medullary
expression of HIF1-a, an index of hypoxia, was upregulated in this
group, but not in ARAS+PTRA, compared to Normal
(Figure 3B,D). Medullary NAD(P)H oxidase p47 expression and
DHE staining were similarly elevated in all ARAS groups
(Figure 4).
Expression of the inflammatory mediator TNF-a was signifi￾cantly elevated in ARAS compared to Normal and to ARA￾S+PTRA+MSC. Additionally, MCP-1 immunoreactivity was
elevated in ARAS and ARAS+PTRA, but did not differ between
ARAS+PTRA+MSC and normal animals. Although medullary
counts of CD163+ macrophages remained elevated in ARA￾S+PTRA+MSC compared to Normal, they were lower than in
ARAS and ARAS+PTRA. Furthermore, the expression of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in ARAS+PTRA+MSC was
augmented vs. the other two ARAS groups (Figure 5).
The CD68+
/Arg1+ co-staining showed that the population of
trophic-macrophages was significantly higher in both ARAS and
ARAS+PTRA vs. Normal (Figure 6) and further higher in
ARAS+PTRA+MSC compared to ARAS+PTRA. In all RAS
groups, results revealed very limited number of neutrophils in the
microvasculature and nearly none infiltrated in the tissue.
Medullary tubulointerstitial fibrosis (trichrome-staining) was
greater than Normal in all experimental groups, but was
significantly blunted in ARAS+PTRA+MSC compared to ARAS
and ARAS+PTRA. Similarly, MMP-2 was only elevated in
ARAS, but was attenuated compared to ARAS in ARA￾S+PTRA+MSC but not in ARAS+PTRA (Figure 6).
Discussion
The current study showed that PTRA with adjunct MSC
delivery restores renal medullary vascularization and attenuates
tubular injury and inflammation substantially more effectively
than PTRA alone. Restoration of main vessel blood flow by PTRA
was associated with partial recovery of medullary volume and
reduction in capillary loss, but medullary tubular responses to
furosemide remained blunted, and GFR and medullary blood flow
remained as low as in untreated ARAS animals. By contrast,
ARAS+PTRA+MSC treated kidneys were characterized by
enhanced expression of angiogenic markers, reduced tubulointer￾stitial fibrosis, and reduced inflammatory markers. These changes
occurred despite higher oxidative stress (reflected by DHE and
p47) and more evident medullary hypoxia (defined by elevated
medullary R2*). Addition of MSC to PTRA enhanced the
response of medullary oxygenation after furosemide, consistent
with increased tubular solute transport.
Although obstruction of the main renal artery and reduction in
RBF for any reason can produce renal parenchymal damage, the
atherosclerotic milieu in ARAS adds an independent adverse
impact on the progression of the renal injury and its hallmarks
[17,18], such as endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis and hypoxia.
These observations suggest that deleterious factors beyond the
stenosis associated with the atherogenic process play important
roles in compromising renal function and potential recovery in
ARAS. Medullary volume and flow declined in ARAS in this study
to greater extent than previously observed in RAS, possibly related
to microvascular vasoconstriction and rarefaction [2].
A decrease in blood and consequently oxygen supply observed
in ARAS is often associated with inflammation, tubulointerstitial
fibrosis and microvascular rarefaction. Our micro-CT and
capillary count suggested loss of vasa recta and their network of
peritubular capillaries with no change in VEGF expression.
Medullary deoxyhemoglobin as reflected by BOLD measurements
rose, associated with a rise in markers of oxidative stress (DHE and
p47) in all ARAS groups. Remarkably, tissue hypoxia as reflected
by HIF-1a expression was not measurably increased in ARAS
compared to normal.
PTRA alone had limited success in decelerating the parenchy￾mal changes of ARAS, as fibrosis remained higher than normal
and similar to ARAS, and BOLD imaging indicated only partial
response to furosemide. Considering the similar GFR in ARAS
and ARAS+PTRA, this response was less likely related to solute
delivery than a partial improvement in tubular function, possibly
as a result of a small increase in capillary density after PTRA. The
direct correlation between tubular function (BOLD response) and
injury score is consistent with this notion. Although medullary
blood flow remained impaired, increased peritubular capillary
density identified by histology suggested that PTRA reduced
damage to the peritubular capillaries. Nevertheless, microvascular
and capillary densities tended to remain low, and baseline R2*
values indicated significantly lower tissue oxygenation in this
group. Notably, the insignificant correlation between capillary
density and BOLD response may suggest that medullary tubular
function is regulated by factors other than blood supply alone (e.g.
GFR). Additionally, ARAS+PTRA manifested tendency for an
increase anti-inflammatory (IL-10) and decrease pro-inflammatory
(TNF-a) mediators, which might have blunted tubular injury
compared to ARAS. Despite limited tissue oxygenation and
increased oxidative stress, HIF-1a expression remained un￾changed, perhaps due to the blunted tubular transport function
in ARAS+PTRA compared to ARAS. Moreover, although
medullary blood flow was similar in ARAS and ARAS+PTRA,
due to their higher peritubular capillary density the tubules in
ARAS+PTRA might be spatially closer to capillaries and receive
higher oxygen supplies.
In contrast to PTRA alone, adjunct MSC improved medullary
vascularization and tubular function and reduced inflammation
and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The vWF staining, microvascular
density, and peritubular capillary counts strongly suggest that the
microvasculature in the medulla of ARAS+PTRA+MSC was
relatively protected or restored, possibly secondary to up-regulated
expression of growth factors like VEGF and its receptor, FLK-1.
Nevertheless, the basal R2* and HIF1-a expression in this group
indicated higher level of tissue hypoxia compared to the other two
ARAS groups. We interpret this as likely secondary to the greater
oxygen demand imposed by improved GFR and solute transport,
in the presence of yet limited medullary perfusion and increased
oxidative stress. Reduced medullary blood flow despite preserved
microvasculature has been previously attributed to a regulatory
mechanism involving reactive oxygen species in the medullary
thick ascending limb (mTAL), tubular-vascular crosstalk [27,28].
Conversely, increased tubular transport function despite residual
tubular injury may account for the increased oxidative stress in
ARAS+PTRA+MSC group, as in the presence of concentrated
tubular solutes, activation of transport in mTAL during hypoxia

may increase intracellular concentrations of superoxide [29] as a
result of engagement of anaerobic glycolysis instead of aerobic
transport function. In ARAS and ARAS+PTRA, on the other
hand, the increase in oxidative stress might be linked to sustained
inflammation. In this study, several inflammatory markers were
lower in ARAS+PTRA+MSC, particularly CD163+ macrophage
infiltration, perhaps due to prominent anti-inflammatory charac￾teristics of MSC (e.g. increase in IL-10 expression) as well as
reduced expression of the chemoattractant MCP-1. Additionally,
we observed that MSC increased the presence of M2 phenotype
macrophages, which are often linked to tissue repair. This may
account for the lesser tubulointerstitial injury and reduced fibrosis
compared to ARAS and ARAS+PTRA. Furthermore, lower
vascular and interstitial remodeling in the MSC group was
associated with diminished expression of MMP-2, which reflects
restoration of matrix turnover and therefore reduced scar tissue.
These anti-inflammatory properties may also underlie the greater
efficacy of MSC in preserving the medullary microcirculation in
the stenotic kidney compared to EPC.
The mechanism of tissue regeneration after administration of
MSC has been the focus of great interest [30,31,32]. Some studies
suggest that repair of injured tissues rarely involves cell replace￾ment and MSC differentiation, whereas the paracrine action of
MSC often accounts for amelioration of injury. While paracrine
signaling may be mediated by release of cytokines and growth
factors into the extracellular environment, recent studies have
implicated MSC shedding of membrane microvesicles, which
provide channels for transport and communication among the
cells, and allow exchange of proteins, lipids, and RNA [33]. Such
microvesicles may contain growth factors like VEGF, which is
necessary for generation and maintenance of the renal microcir￾culation, or anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, benefits
conferred by MSC that involve delivery of trophic substances to
the renal tissue.
Limitations: Due to the limitations of experimental studies on
large animals our group sizes were limited. In our model ARAS
develops over a period of 16 weeks, which is shorter than the usual
duration of the disease in humans, and might influence its
interaction with pathological factors involved in disease progres￾sion. Nevertheless, the chain of events and mechanisms of tissue
injury in our ARAS model closely resemble that in humans. In
addition, the spatial resolution of the micro-CT imaging technique
that we used to calculate medullary microvascular density is close
to the limit needed to evaluate individual vasa recta. Furosemide
may increase renal vascular resistance in some models, but has no
significant effect on RBF in swine unilateral RAS [20], arguing
against a hemodynamic influence on tissue oxygenation and
assessment of tubular function. Special care was also taken to
avoid partial volume error, yet we cannot completely rule out the
possibility of some errors. The optimal timing and dose of MSC
that yield the greatest renoprotective benefit will need to be
determined in future studies.
In conclusion, PTRA alone elicited only partial recovery of
renal medullary tubular transport function, microvascular density
and inflammation in ARAS. Adjunct delivery of MSC+PTRA
improved GFR as well as medullary vascular densities and oxygen￾dependent tubular transport. Delivery of MSC increased medul￾lary R2* levels, enhanced VEGF expression and reduced MCP-1
compared with PTRA alone. These changes were associated with
reduced CD163+ cells in the post-stenotic kidney, increased IL-10
and M2 macrophages, and lower interstitial fibrosis. Adjunctive
PTRA+MSC improved medullary blood flows and recovery of
kidney function, possibly as a result of microvascular repair and
anti-inflammatory effects of MSC. This study therefore extends
the value of MSC as adjunctive therapy to restore medullary
structure and function in ARAS after PTRA.
