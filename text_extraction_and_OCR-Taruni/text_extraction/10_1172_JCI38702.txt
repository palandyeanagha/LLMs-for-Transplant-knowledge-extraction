The IL-23/IL-17 and IL-12/IFN-γ cytokine pathways have a role in chronic autoimmunity, which is considered
mainly a dysfunction of adaptive immunity. The extent to which they contribute to innate immunity is, how￾ever, unknown. We used a mouse model of acute kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) to test the hypoth￾esis that early production of IL-23 and IL-12 following IRI activates downstream IL-17 and IFN-γ signaling
pathways and promotes kidney inflammation. Deficiency in IL-23,IL-17A, or IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) and mAb
neutralization of CXCR2, the p19 subunit of IL-23, or IL-17A attenuated neutrophil infiltration in acute kid￾ney IRIin mice. We further demonstrate thatIL-17A produced by GR-1+ neutrophils was criticalfor kidney IRI
in mice. Activation ofthe IL-12/IFN-γ pathway and NKT cells by administering α-galactosylceramide–primed
bone marrow–derived DCs increased IFN-γ production following moderate IRI in WT mice but did not exac￾erbate injury or enhance IFN-γ production in either Il17a–/– or Il17r–/– mice, which suggested thatIL-17 signal￾ing was proximal to IFN-γ signaling. This was confirmed by the finding that IFN-γ administration reversed
the protection seen in Il17a–/– mice subjected to IRI, whereas IL-17A failed to reverse protection in Ifng–/– mice.
These results demonstrate that the innate immune component of kidney IRI requires dual activation of the
IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 signaling pathways and that neutrophil production of IL-17A is upstream of
IL-12/IFN-γ. These mechanisms might contribute to reperfusion injury in other organs.
Introduction
The heterodimeric cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, which are secreted
mainly by activated DCs and macrophages in response to TLR
activation (1, 2), stimulate T cell differentiation and function in
linking innate and adaptive immunity. IL-12 and IL-23 contribute
to autoimmunity and host defense through separate IL-12/IFN-γ–
and IL-23/IL-17–dependent pathways (3). IL-23 is composed of
p40 and p19 subunits, whereas bioactive 70-kDa IL-12 (IL-12p70)
is a p35/p40 heterodimer. Although IL-23 and IL-12 share the
p40 subunit and some similar functions, they possess distinct fea￾tures (4). IL-12 induces the production of IFN-γ by NK/NKT cells
and Th1 cells, while IL-23, in conjunction with IL-6 and TGF-β, 
stimulatesthe differentiation of Th17 cells(the subset of T helper
cells that produce IL-17) and the subsequent production of IL-17
(5). p40/p19 induces Th17 cells to produce IL-17, a pro-inflam￾matory cytokine that plays an important role in host defense and
mediates chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases, such
as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel
disease, and psoriasis (6–9) in both humans and mice. IL-23 and
IL-17 are critical mediatorsfor neutrophil recruitment and migra￾tion through the induction of granulopoiesis and production of
G-CSF, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and neutrophil chemoattractant che￾mokines, including CXCL1, -2, and -5 (10–12).
Although most data support a role of the IL-23/Th17/IL-17
pathway in mediating chronic inflammatory diseases (3), such as
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma,systemic lupus erythematosus, mul￾tiple sclerosis, and allograft rejection (13–15), some data suggest
that the IL-23/Th17/IL-17 pathway might participate in innate
immunity. Acute infections lead to activation of DCs to produce
IL-23 with subsequent activation of IFN-α/β and IFN-γ/δ and
NKT cell production of IL-17 (3, 10, 16–18), which leads to the
recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection (13).
In kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a model of acute
kidney injury, IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 pathways appear to be
activated. Ischemic kidney injury causes production of IL-17–pro￾moting cytokines, such as TGF-β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, in the
inflamed kidney (19). In addition, we and others have shown that
IFN-γ–producingCD4+Tcells,NKTcells, andGR-1+neutrophils are
importantin the pathogenesis of kidney IRI (20, 21). However, very
few studies have examined the role of IL-12/IFN-γ or IL-23/IL-17
or their interaction in the innate immune response to injury.
We sought to test the early involvement of IL-23/IL-17 in innate
immunity and the interaction of IL-17A and IFN-γ in kidney IRI
innate immunity. Ourstudies demonstrated that both IL-12/IFN-γ
and IL-23/IL-17 pathways are activated in kidney IRI and that
IL-17A–producing neutrophils acted proximally and are required
for IFN-γ production and kidney injury following IRI.
Results
The IL-23/IL-17 axis is essential for the inflammatory response to kidney IRI.
During the period ofreperfusion following an ischemic eventin kid￾ney as well as numerous other organs, activation of the inflamma￾tory system accompanies a complex immune cascade in response to
ischemic injury. Increasesin cytokines and chemokines mediate the
influx of immune cells into kidney after injury. To test the involve￾ment of the IL-23 cytokine pathway in injured kidneys, we initially
investigated mRNA expression levels ofthe 2 subunits of IL-23, p40

in Figure 1A, both p40 and p19 mRNA expression increased signifi￾cantly between 4 and 6 hours after IRI compared with sham-oper￾ated control mice. We then compared kidney function and pathol￾ogy after IRI in p40–/–, p19–/–, and WT mice. Following 24 hours of
reperfusion,therewas a marked increase in plasma creatinine in WT
mice, but p40–/– and p19–/– micewere protected from kidney injury as
indicated by lower plasma creatinine levels (Figure 1B), less tubular
necrosis(Figure 1C), and lower acute tubular necrosis(ATN)scores

observed in p19–/– micewas also foundwhen WT micewere pretreat￾ed with anti-p19 neutralization mAb (100 μg) 18 hours prior to IRI
compared with isotype IgG1-treated mice (Figure 1B). IL-23 pro￾motes the production of IL-17A, a member of a family of cytokines
whose downstream mediatorsregulate neutrophil recruitment and
function. We hypothesized that increased IL-23 expression drives
the production of IL-17A to promote kidney injury through its
receptor, IL-17R, following ischemia-reperfusion. The protective
effects observed in kidney function and morphology in Il17a–/– and
Il17r–/– mice after IRI compared with WT mice demonstrated that
the IL-17 signaling pathway was involved in kidney IRI (Figure 1,
D and E). Protection was also observed in WT mice pretreated with
neutralization anti–IL-17A mAb (Figure 1D).
Downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with 
the IL-23/IL-17 pathway mediate neutrophil recruitment in kidney IRI.
Infiltration of neutrophils is one of the hallmarks of kidney IRI
and may be mediated by production of downstream pro-inflamma￾tory cytokines/chemokines of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway. Blocking
neutrophil infiltration by using an anti-CXCR2 antibody prevented
the increase in plasma creatinine levels and tubular necrosis in the
kidney outer medulla following kidney IRI (Figure 2, A and B). Fol￾lowing kidney IRI, expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
IL-6 and TNF-α was elevated in kidneys as early as 2 hours follow￾ing reperfusion and increased at 4–6 hours (Figure 2C). Expres￾sion of CXCL1 and CXCL2, chemokines known to mediate
neutrophil migration, increased compared with sham at 2 and
4 hours after reperfusion, respectively. CXCL1 remained elevated
24 hours following reperfusion (Figure 2C). No significant change
in Cxcl5 mRNA expression was identified in the reperfused kid￾neys compared with sham (data notshown). The rise in neutrophil
chemotactic factors preceded the known time course (22) for neu￾trophil infiltration into kidneys following IRI. To investigate the

role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in mediating cytokine and chemokine
production following kidney IRI, Il6, Il1b, Tnfa, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2
mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR in WT and KO mice
after 6 hours of reperfusion. The increase in expression of IL-6,
TNF-α, CXCL1, and CXCL2 observed in WT mouse kidneys after
IRI was not found in p19–/–, Il17r–/–, or Il17a–/– mice (Figure 2D).
The observed effects on cytokine and chemokine production
prompted us to evaluate a role of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in neu￾trophil infiltration after IRI. The marked increase in infiltration
of CD11b+GR-1+ neutrophils in kidneys of WT mice after IRI was
diminished in p40–/–, p19–/–, Il17r–/–, and Il17a–/– mouse kidneys
after IRI, as revealed by FACS analysis (Supplemental Figure 1).
Immunofluorescence showed CXCL1 production mainly in kid￾ney tubule cells at 6 hoursfollowing reperfusion (data notshown),
but intense labeling for CXCL1 was observed in infiltrating 7/4+
neutrophils in kidneys of WT mice 24 hours after IRI (Figure 3, A,
E, and F), primarily in the outer medulla. A decrease in neutrophil
recruitment in kidneys from p19–/–, Il17r–/–, and Il17a–/– mice that
were protected from IRI was associated with low CXCL1 (Figure
3, B–D and G–J) and CXCL2 expression (data not shown). Collec￾tively, these data strongly support the causal relationship between
IL-23/IL-17 in neutrophil recruitment and the inflammatory
immune response in kidneys after IRI.
Neutrophils are the major source of IL-17A in kidneys following IRI.
We next performed a series of experiments to identify the cells in
kidneys following IRI that produce IL-17A. After kidney ischemia
and only 3 hours of reperfusion, by FACS analysis of intracellularly
labeled cells, we found more IL-17A–producing CD45+ cells in IRI
kidneysrelative to sham (Figure 4A). Il17a–/– → WT and WT → WT
bone marrow chimeras were created to examine the contribution of
bone marrow–derived cells asthe source ofIL-17A in kidney IRI. Sig￾nificant morphological (data notshown) and functional protection
from kidney IRIwasfound in Il17a–/–→WTIRI mice comparedwith
WT→WTmice.PlasmacreatinineincreasedsignificantlyinWT→WT
mice afterIRI,butnotinIl17a–/–→WTIRImice,whichlackedIL-17A
in bone marrowcells(Figure 4B). Similarly,fewerinfiltrating neutro￾philswere found in kidneys ofthe protected chimeric mice by FACS
analysis and immunostaining (data notshown). Therefore, we con￾cluded that IL-17A–producing bone marrow–derived cells contrib￾ute to kidney injury. We then pretreated T cell– and B cell–deficient
Rag1–/– mice with anti–IL-17A mAb before IRI and found that they
had a reduction in injury similarto that of WT mice pretreatedwith
anti–IL-17A mAb (Figure 4C),with less 7/4+ neutrophil infiltration
and neutrophilCXCL1 expression (Figure 4D)following kidney IRI.
These in vivo studies suggested that cells other than T, B, and NKT
cells produce IL-17A and are involved in kidney IRI.

To identify the leukocyte subset, we used an IL-17 secretion assay
to simultaneously detect IL-17A–producing cells and their phe￾notype. Interestingly, IL-17A was secreted from the recruited neu￾trophils (Figure 5A) but not from CD4 or CD8 T cells or NK1.1+
cells (Supplemental Figure 2). Finally, to demonstrate functional
significance of IL-17 production by neutrophils in kidney IRI, we
adoptively transferred to recipient Il17a–/– mice neutrophils from
the bone marrow of WT (WT → Il17a–/– mice) or Il17a–/– mice
(Il17a–/– → Il17a–/– mice). Kidney injury was reconstituted in
WT → Il17a–/– but not Il17a–/– → Il17a–/– mice (Figure 5B). Further￾more, in WT → Il17a–/– mice the reconstituted injury was blocked
with 100 μg anti-mouse IL-17A mAb. These data demonstrate that
neutrophils,rather than T, NKT, or B cells, are the majorsource of
IL-17A production involved in kidney IRI.
Impaired IFN-γ production by GR-1+ neutrophils in mice with deficient 
IL-23/IL-17A/IL-17R pathways.We have shown previously thatGR-1+
neutrophils are the major immune source of IFN-γ following kid￾ney IRI (20) and in the currentstudy we showed thatIL-23/IL-17 is
importantfor neutrophilrecruitmentfollowing IRI. Therefore, we
investigated whether disruption of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway alters
the IFN-γ–mediated immune response to kidney IRI. As expected,
fewer IFN-γ–producing GR-1+ neutrophils infiltrated the kidney
after IRI in IL-12–deficient (p35–/–) mice than in WT mice, but this
was also found in p40–/–, p19–/–, Il17a–/–, and Il17r–/– mice (Table 1).
Thus, blocking either the IL-23 or IL-17 pathway reduced
not only neutrophil recruitment but also neutrophil IFN-γ
production, imparting an important role of the IL-17 pathway in
IFN-γ–mediated kidney IRI.
Both IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 pathways are involved in activated 
NKT cell–mediated inflammation in kidney IRI. Previously we showed
that CD1d-restricted NKT cell activation contributes critically to
kidney IRIthrough IFN-γ production and regulation of neutrophil
infiltration (20). Here we further demonstrate the involvement of
the IL-12/IFN-γ pathway in IRI-induced kidney inflammation by
using p35–/– and Ifng–/– mice. Compared with WT mice, ATN scores
(Supplemental Table 1) and plasma creatinine levels (Figure 6A)
were lower 24 hours afterIRI in mice lacking p35 and IFN-γ signal￾ing, and plasma creatininewassignificantly lowerfollowing kidney
IRI in mice treated with neutralizing anti–IFN-γ antibody (Figure
6A) compared with WT mice treated with IgG1 isotype control.
In addition, following kidney IRI we observed an 81% reduction
of CD11b+GR-1+ neutrophils infiltrating the kidney both in mice

lacking IFN-γ (P < 0.05; n = 3–9) and in mice lacking p35 (P < 0.05;
n = 5–9) compared with WT IRI mice, thus indicating that the
IL-12/IFN-γ pathway is involved in neutrophil recruitment into
kidney following IRI. Furthermore, IFN-γ deficiency abrogated
the IRI-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine and che￾mokine mRNA expression (Supplemental Table 2). Therefore, we
concluded that both the IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 pathways
mediate neutrophil recruitment in kidney IRI.
Our results showing that both the IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17
pathways mediate neutrophil recruitment in kidney IRI suggest
that these pathways may also be important in NKT cell–mediated
kidney injury. We posited that production of IL-12 and CD1d pre￾sentation of glycolipids by ischemia-reperfusion–activated DCs
trigger and stimulate NKT cell–mediated kidney injury, and we
further hypothesized that IL-23/IL-17 contributes to this pro￾cess. To examine the interaction of NKT cells with IL-12/IFN-γ
and IL-23/IL-17 pathwaysin promoting the kidney inflammatory
response, we used bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDCs) primed
with α-galactosylceramide (BMDC-αGalCer) to activate kidney
NKT cells before a moderate (24-minute) subthreshold level of
ischemic injury. This strategy has been used widely to modulate
NKT cell activation in different mouse models and human dis￾ease, and substantial IFN-γ production, which contributes to tis￾sue injury and inflammation, has been found after administra￾tion of BMDC-αGalCer (23–28). Compared with WT mice that
received unprimed BMDCs and showed no significant change in
kidney function after a moderate ischemic injury, a large increase
in the level of plasma creatinine was found in WT mice treated
with BMDC-αGalCer (Figure 6B). However, creatinine was not
elevated by BMDC-αGalCer and IRI in mice deficient in NKT cells
(Cd1d–/– and Ja18–/– mice) orIfng–/– (Figure 6B), but it wasincreased
in Tnfa–/– mice (1.55-fold ± 0.12-fold vs. 1.85-fold ± 0.66-fold com￾pared with sham for Tnfa–/– and WT mice, respectively; P = NS).
These results demonstrate that BMDC-αGalCer–mediated spe￾cific NKT cell activation exacerbates moderate kidney IRI inflam￾mation through IFN-γ–dominant cytokine production.
To further investigate whether kidney injury by specific NKT
cell activation is mediated by the IL-23/IL-17 pathway, we also
adoptively transferred WT BMDC-αGalCer to p40–/–, p19–/–,
Il17a–/–, and Il17r–/– mice (IL-23/IL-17A/R pathway) and, for com￾parison with the IL-12/IFN-γ pathway, to p35–/– and Ifng–/– mice.
Interestingly, only WT mice that received BMDC-αGalCer before
surgery showed significant functional (Figure 6C) and morpho￾logical injury (H&E staining; data not shown) and an anticipated
infiltration of neutrophils (data not shown), including a popula￾tion of GR-1+IFN-γ+ neutrophils in kidney (Figure 6D), following
moderate kidney IRI. In addition, adoptive transfer of BMDC￾αGalCer prior to surgery produced a dramatic increase in plasma
IFN-γ levelsin WT mice, which was consistent with higher plasma
creatinine levels following kidney IRI, compared with mice defi￾cient in NKT cells, IL-12, IL-23, IL-17, or IFN-γ (Figure 6E). These
results suggest that both IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 signal

Ifng–/– mice 1 hour prior to kidney surgery. The protection from
injury observed in the control Ifng–/– mice (which received PBS)
was not reconstituted by administration of rm IL-17A, as plasma
creatinine did not increase in either group of mice after IRI rela￾tive to the sham groups(Figure 7A). Conversely, plasma creatinine
increased significantly in Il17r–/– (data not shown) or Il17a–/– mice
that received rm IFN-γ (30,000 U/mouse 1 hour before IRI) com￾pared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 7A). Similarly, reconstitu￾tion of the infiltration of CD11b+GR-1+ neutrophils after IRI was
revealed by FACS analysis of kidneys from Il17a–/– mice given rm
IFN-γ but not in Ifng–/– mice given rm IL-17A (Figure 7B). These
resultsindicate that IL-17A is upstream of IFN-γ in the inflamma￾tory response that occurs in kidney IRI.
Taken together with our results described above (that mice defi￾cient in not only p35/IFN-γ but also the IL-23/IL-17A/R pathway
showed decreased neutrophil recruitment and IFN-γ production
after IRI), these results suggest that cross-talk between the IL-12/
IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 pathways promotes the cytokine cascade
immune responses in kidney IRI.
Discussion
In this study we establish a critical role for both the IL-12/IFN-γ 
and IL-23/IL-17 signaling pathways in mediating the innate
immune response to kidney IRI and that IL-23/IL-17 is proximal
to and necessary for IL-12/IFN-γ–mediated tissue injury. IL-17A
produced from neutrophils regulates NKT activation, IFN-γ pro￾duction, neutrophil infiltration, and tissue injury in kidney IRI.
We determined that neutrophils, and not Th17 cells, contribute
to the innate immune response of kidney IRI, as we found that
neutrophils are the predominant source of IL-17A that contrib￾utesto kidney IRI. We further demonstrated that IL-12/IFN-γ and
IL-23/IL-17 do not simply act in parallel, but rather activation of
the IL-23/IL-17 axis is necessary for stimulating the IL-12/IFN-γ 
axis to regulate neutrophil migration and a “sterile” innate
immune response in a model of kidney injury (Figure 8).
Although the IL-23/Th17/IL-17 pathway has been best
described in mediating chronic inflammatory diseases (3), such
as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus
and multiple sclerosis and in allograft rejection (13–15), little
was known regarding the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in innate immu￾nity and nothing was known regarding acute kidney IRI. Proin￾flammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced by stromal,
epithelial, and endothelial cells in response to IL-17 to rapidly
recruit neutrophils to sites of infection (13). Th17 cells differ￾entiate from precursor cells in the presence of TGF-β and IL-6
(and perhaps IL-1β), and IL-23 is important for maintenance and
expansion of the Th17 cell population (29). These studies and the
results of prior studies that demonstrated increased expression
of TGF-β, IL-6, IL-1β, and chemokines that mediate neutrophil
infiltration after kidney IRI (30–32) suggested that Th17 cells
may play a role in IL-17 production and subsequent regulation of
neutrophil migration. However, the current study demonstrated
a rapid increase in neutrophil influx in response to activation
of IL-17/IL-23 from non-Th17 cells following kidney IRI, sug￾gesting that acute innate mechanisms were responsible for the
observed injury. This conclusion was supported by the absence
of T and B cell production of IL-17. In contrast, we showed that
neutrophils produce IL-17A following kidney IRI and that these
cells contribute to the inflammatory response to kidney injury.
First, as early as 3 hours following kidney IRI, we found more
IL-17A–producing CD45+ cells in the kidney. Second, we demon￾strated that bone marrow–derived cells that produce IL-17A are
necessary for kidney injury. We drew this conclusion from stud￾ies in which we showed that Il17a–/– → WT bone marrow chime￾ras had significantly less neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury
24 hours after kidney IRI compared with WT → WT chimeras.
Third, we demonstrated that the IL-17–producing cells in kidney
IRI are not T cells or B cells. Kidneysfrom Rag1–/– mice, which lack
T cells and B cells, were protected from kidney IRI after IL-17A
neutralization. Fourth, the IL-17A–secreting cells detected in
kidneys after 3 hours of reperfusion were CD11b+GR-1+ neutro￾phils. Fifth, the protection in Il17a–/– mice was reversed following
adoptive transfer of WT neutrophils but not Il17a–/– neutrophils,
and the reconstituted injury was attenuated by antibody neutral￾ization of IL-17A. Taken together, these data demonstrate that
IL-17A–producing neutrophils contribute to innate immunity in
kidney IRI. A previous report of neutrophil production of IL-17
waslimited to RT-PCR of Il17 mRNA from a relatively pure popu￾lation of neutrophils (33). High levels of IL-23 that are produced
early in kidney tissue after IRI may promote neutrophil IL-17A
production. Thus a “feed-forward” system may have evolved in
which the initial stimulus of neutrophil influx may be further
augmented in a second wave due in part to neutrophil produc￾tion of IL-17A acting in an autocrine fashion and producing the
neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and -2 (Figure 3F).
Our previous study showed that IRI activated the Th1 pathway
through activation of NKT cells (20). In that study we identified
a large influx of NKT cells that produced IFN-γ within 3 hours
of reperfusion after ischemia, and through the use of Ja18–/– and
Cd1d–/– mice and monoclonal antibodies to block the interac￾Figure 7

tion between CD1d-glycolipid presentation to NKT cells (CD1d
mAb), we demonstrated the functional importance of NKT cells
in the innate immune response to kidney IRI (20). IFN-γ was
produced mainly from CD1d-restricted NKT cells and GR-1+
neutrophilsin kidney after IRI (20). CD4+ NKT cells may provide
an explanation for how T cells, traditionally a part of the adap￾tive immune system, play a role in innate immunity. The results
of the current study also demonstrate that the IL-23/IL-17
signal pathway regulates IL-12/IFN-γ, driving neutrophil migra￾tion and tissue injury. IL-12 and IL-23 are produced by DCs (22),
the major leukocyte subset in kidney (~50%) (22). In addition to
activation of the IL-23/IL-17 signaling pathway, we also estab￾lished that this pathway regulates IL-12/IFN-γ in mediating
tissue injury. In the current study, adoptive transfer of BMDC￾αGalCer exacerbated the inflammatory response to moderate
kidney IRI by activating NKT cells and stimulating secretion
of a large amount of IFN-γ (20). This effect was blocked with
anti-p40 neutralization mAb (our unpublished observations).
Adoptive transfer of BMDC-αGalCer to activate NKT cells prior
to surgery did not enhance kidney injury in p35/p40/IFN-γ sig￾nal–deficient or p40/p19/IL-17 signal–deficient mice compared
with WT mice after a subthreshold ischemic injury. In addition,
BMDC-αGalCer–triggered effector cytokine IFN-γ production
from GR-1+ neutrophils was dependent not only on p35/IFN-γ
signaling, but also on p40/p19/IL-17 signaling. These data dem￾onstrate that the absence of either IL-12/IFN-γ or IL-23/IL-17
signaling blocked the enhancement of injury typically mediat￾ed by rapid, early NKT cell activation. Furthermore, less IFN-γ
production was observed in Il23–/–, Il17a–/–, and Il17r–/– mice
following BMDC-αGalCer stimulation. This suggests that the
IL-23/IL-17 axis is a critical pathway that is necessary for IFN-γ
secretion in the acute innate immune response of kidney IRI.
Moreover, rm IFN-γ administered to Il17a–/– mice subjected
to IRI reversed the protection normally seen in Il17a–/– mice,
thereby resulting in impaired kidney function and enhanced
neutrophil migration, whereas rm IL-17A did not reverse the
protective effect of IFN-γ deficiency following kidney IRI. Taken
together, the data here demonstrate that the IL-17A/R signal is
upstream of IFN-γ in the mediation of inflammation and neu￾trophil infiltration in kidney IRI.
CellsproducingbothIFN-γ andIL-17areuncommonbuthavebeen
reported in human intestine with inflammatory bowel disease (34),
and these double-positive cells in a mouse EAE model co-expressed
RORγt and T-bet (35); the biological importance of this unique cell
populationisunclear.Inanother exampleof alternatepathways,IL-23
promoted IFN-γ production, rather than IL-17 production, via an
IL-23– andTNF-α–dependent pathway in human colon disease (36).
These findings and our currentresultsindicate thatIL-23 isinvolved
in the pathogenesis of disease not only through IL-23/IL-17, but also
through a previously undefined IL-23/IFN-γ axis. Togetherwith our
previous data (20), we found that neutrophils produce both IFN-γ 
and IL-17A in kidney. The autocrine effect of IL-17A on neutrophil
IFN-γ production and the role of the transcription factors RORγt
and T-bet in neutrophils willrequire furtherinvestigation.
Macrophages are recruited in a CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent
manner to the inflamed kidney (22). IL-1 and IL-6 are produced in
the kidney following IRI (19), mainly by infiltrating macrophages
Figure 8
Model summarizing the role of the IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 axes of 
the innate immune response in kidney IRI. (A) Injury to kidney epithelial 
cells early (6 hours) following IRI promotes inflammation by increasing 
pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, including neutro￾phil chemoattractant chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL2). CXCL1 and 
CXCL2 mediate PMN recruitment and kidney injury through the che￾mokine receptor CXCR2 (expressed mainly on neutrophils). Autocrine 
CXCL1/2 production by infiltrating PMNs likely stimulates additional 
infiltration. (B) Both IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 pathways are activated 
in kidney IRI. Kidney resident DCs initiate the immune response follow￾ing kidney IRI by secreting IL-12 and IL-23. DCs activate NKT cells by 
CD1d-mediated glycolipid presentation and CD40/CD40L costimula￾tion. IL-12 mediates NKT cell activation and IFN-γ production, which 
further stimulates neutrophil IFN-γ production and infiltration of PMNs 
and other immune cells (CD4+ and NKT cells and macrophages; not 
shown) that contribute to kidney injury. IL-23 is also involved in NKT 
cell activation (our unpublished observations). IL-23 (with TGF-β 
and IL-6; not shown) is known to induce Th17 cell differentiation, but 
neutrophils, not Th17 cells, are the predominant source of IL-17A in 
the innate immune response in kidney IRI. IL-23 and its downstream 
cytokine IL-17A induce pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) 
and chemokine (CXCL1/2) (not shown) production to promote kidney 
inflammation. (C) The IL-23/IL-17 axis is proximal to and necessary for 
IL-12/IFN-γ–mediated tissue injury through NKT cell activation. IL-17A 
produced from PMNs regulates NKT cell activation, IFN-γ production, 
PMN infiltration and tissue injury in kidney IRI. Therefore, in addition 
to IL-12/IFN-γ, IL-23 and IL-17 signal pathways also participate in the 
innate immune response to IRI by stimulating activated NKT cell–medi￾ated kidney inflammation and PMN infiltration.

(22). Considering the requirement of IL-1 and IL-6 for IL-17A pro￾duction, these results suggest that IL-1 and IL-6 act upstream of
IL-17A to induce kidney IRI inflammation. We have shown that
kidneys of mice deficient in IL-6 were protected from IRI and had
reduced neutrophil infiltration (our unpublished observations).
These findings suggest that macrophages contribute to neutro￾phil recruitment and cytokine/chemokine production and may be
involved in the IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 axes in kidney IRI.
Further investigation of the role of macrophage-derived cytokines
and the relationship of the IL-12/IFN-γ and IL-23/IL-17 pathways
to trafficking of heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations in
the inflamed kidney is needed.
Collectively, our study demonstrated that both IL-12 and IL-23
and theirsubsequent IFN-γ/IL-17 signaling pathways participated
in the innate immune inflammation associated with kidney IRI.
Our data also supported the requirement of IL-17A in regulating
IFN-γ in the innate immune response to injury. Both IL-17A and
IFN-γ are produced by neutrophils and may positively regulate
neutrophil transmigration to the injured kidney following kidney
IRI. Further identification of the mechanism of IL-17 and IFN-γ
release from neutrophils will add to our understanding of the
immunological pathwaysinvolved in kidney IRI and should aid in
development of new therapeutic strategies for patients with acute
kidney injury. Whether the IL-23/IL-17 pathway contributes to
reperfusion injury of other organs such as heart, lung, and brain
will need to be established, and a clear understanding of this path￾way may yield important targets for therapy.
Methods
Mice and surgical protocol. All experiments were performed in accordance
with NIH and IACUC guidelines. The Animal Research Committee of the
University of Virginia approved all procedures and protocols. We used WT
C57BL/6 mice (~20 g, 6–8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories), and the
following genetically deficient mice were bred on a C57BL/6 background:
p19–/– (a gift from Dan Cua, Schering-Plough Biopharma), Il17a–/– (a gift
from Yoichiro Iwakura, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and Il17r–/–
(Amgen Inc.). p40–/–, p35–/–, and Ifng–/– mice on a C57BL/6 background were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Following anesthesia, bilateral flank incisions were performed as previ￾ously described (19). Both kidney pedicles were exposed and cross-clamped
for 28 minutes, then clamps were released (reperfusion) for different times.
In experiments designed to evaluate exacerbation of injury, kidneys were
clamped for only 24 minutes to produce moderate injury. Body tempera￾ture was maintained at 37°C during surgery. Kidney pedicles were exposed
but not clamped in sham-operated mice.
Varying doses of previously described (4) monoclonal anti-mouse
IL-17A (clone 50104; R&D Systems), p19 (G23-8), and IFN-γ (XMG1.2;
eBioscience) were evaluated (Supplemental Figure 3), and the optimal
dose of these neutralization antibodies (100 μg/mouse for anti-p19 and
anti–IFN-γ; 50 μg/mouse for anti–IL-17A) or their respective isotype con￾trols was administrated i.v. 18 hours prior to kidney surgery. Anti-CXCR2
goat serum or control goat serum was administered i.v. to WT mice 18
hours and 1 hour prior to kidney surgery (37). In some experiments mice
received rm IL-17A (50 ng i.p.; R&D System) or IFN-γ (30,000 U i.p.;
PeproTech) 1 hour prior to ischemia.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from kidneys with Tri Reagent
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Research Center
Inc.). Gene sequences were obtained from the GenBank database. Prim￾ers were designed using IDT PrimerQuest (http://www.idtdna.com/
Scitools/Applications/Primerquest/; Integrated DNA Technologies)
and Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). Primer sequences
were as follows: p40, ACCTGTGACACGCCTGAAGAAGAT (forward),
TCTTGTGGAGCAGCAGATGTGAGT (reverse); p19, CAACTTCA￾CACCTCCCTAC (forward), CCACTGCTGACTAGAACT (reverse);
CXCL1, TGGCTGGGATTCACCTCAAGAACA (forward), TGTGGC￾TATGACTTCGGTTTGGGT (reverse); CXCL2, ACATCCCACCCA￾CACAGTGAAAGA (forward), ACATCCCACCCACACAGTGAAAGA
(reverse); IL-6, TGGCTAAGGACCAAGACCATCCAA (forward), AAC￾GCACTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGA (reverse); TNF-α, CCTCCCTCT￾CATCAGTTCTATGG (forward), CGTGGGCTACAGGCTTGTC
(reverse); and GAPDH, ACGGCAAATTCAACGGCACAGTCA (forward),
TGGGGGCATCGGCAGAAGG (reverse). RT-PCR was performed on the
cDNA using the iScript 1-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad),
and samples were normalized to GAPDH. All real-time PCR assays were
performed in duplicate 25-μl reactions in 96-well plates. The resulting
melting curves were visually inspected to ensure specificity of product
detection. The following PCR protocol was used: initial denaturation
(95°C for 3 minutes); denaturation, annealing, and elongation program
repeated 35 times (95°C for 45 seconds, 52°C for 60 seconds, and 72°C
for 60 seconds); final elongation (72°C for 7 minutes); and finally, a
holding step at 4°C as described previously (38).
Tissue digestion and kidney neutrophil cell counting by FACS. Kidney cell sus￾pensions were prepared from mice subjected to IRI orsham operation, and
kidney leukocyte subset cell number was calculated as described before
(20). Kidney CD45+CD11b+GR-1+7-AAD– cells were identified as neutro￾phils. The following antibodies(1 μg/ml; eBioscience) were used to identify
kidney neutrophils: APC-conjugated Alexa Fluor 750–labeled anti-mouse
CD45 (30-F11), PE-labeled anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), and APC-labeled
anti-mouse GR-1 (Ly6G RB6-8C5). 7-AAD was used to exclude dead cells.
Flowcytometry datawere acquired using BD FACSCalibur(BD Biosciences)
and analyzed with FlowJo software 6.4 (Tree Star Inc.).
Measurement of kidney IL-17A–producing leukocytes. Sham and IRI mouse
kidneys were digested after different periods of reperfusion, and CD45+
cells were isolated using anti-CD45 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.).
Isolated CD45+ cells were restimulated with a leukocyte activation cock￾tail (with BD GolgiPlug) for 5 hours following the manufacturer’s pro￾tocol (BD Biosciences). Intracellular staining of IL-17A and analysis by
FACS was performed as previously described (20). PE-labeled anti-mouse
IL-17A (TC11-18H10; BD Biosciences) and APC–Alexa Fluor 750–labeled
CD45 (30-F11; eBioscience) were added to each sample separately after
blocking with anti-mouse CD16/32 (1 μg/ml; eBioscience) for 20 min￾utes on ice. Intracellular isotype controls were performed at the same
time. 7-AAD was used to exclude dead cells.
Intracellular IFN-γ detection was performed by FACS as described
before (20). The cell surface was labeled with anti-mouse GR-1, then cells
were washed, fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with anti-mouse IFN-γ
(1 μg/ml; eBioscience).
Detection of IL-17A–secreting cells. The protocol provided by Miltenyi Biotec
was followed. Mouse kidneys were digested and cell pellets were stimu￾lated in vitro with phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin
(1 μg/ml) for 3 hours. Cells were washed and labeled with IL-17 Catch
reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) for 5 minutes on ice. Warm complete RPMI-1640
medium was added, and cells were incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C. After
washing, cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IL-17 detec￾tion antibody for 10 minutes on ice. Cells were washed, and PE-labeled
anti-biotin and additional staining reagents such as GR-1(Ly6G)-FITC,
CD45-APC–Alexa Fluor 750, CD11b-APC, and 7-AAD or fluorophore￾tagged antibodies against markersfor T cells(CD4 and CD8) and NK cells
(NK1.1) were added at the same time for 10 minutes on ice. Cells were
washed, and data were collected using FACS.

Priming BMDCs with αGalCer. Bone marrow cells were isolated from WT
mice, and 98% pure DCs were obtained following 2 weeks in culture as
described before (39). Cells were primed with 1 μg/ml αGalCer (AXXORA
LLC) for 2.5 days, and vehicle (0.1% DMSO in culture medium) was used as
a control. Primed or unprimed cells were washed, and 0.6 × 106 cells/mouse
(optimal dose) were introduced i.v. to naive mice for 2 days prior to kidney
ischemia-reperfusion surgery and a moderate (24-minute) ischemic injury.
Bone marrow polymorphonuclear cell isolation and adoptive transfer. Bone
marrow polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) were collected using Percoll
gradients as described before (40), and the purity was assessed by FACS.
More than 96% CD11b+GR-1(Ly6G)+ PMNs were collected. WT or Il17a–/–
PMNs (106) were adoptively transferred to naive Il17a–/– mice 1 hour prior
to ischemia-reperfusion surgery.
Generation of chimeric mice. Chimeric mice were generated by transferring
bone marrow cells as described before (19). There were 2 groups of bone
marrow–chimeric mice, WT → WT mice and Il17a–/– → WT mice. Chimeric
mice were used 8 weeks after bone marrow transfer. Using this method,
reconstitution efficiency was nearly 95% (19, 41).
Histochemistry. Kidneys were fixed for H&E staining as previously
described (41) and viewed by light microscopy (Zeiss AxioSkop) under
×200 magnification. Photographs were taken and brightness/contrast
adjustment was made with a SPOT RT camera (software version 3.3; Diag￾nostic Instruments). Histological examinations were performed by 2 renal
pathologists blinded to the conditions. The histological change in the
outer medulla was expressed as ATN,scored by counting the percentage of
tubules that displayed cell necrosis, loss of brush border, cast formation,
and tubule dilatation asfollows: 0, none; 1, <10%; 2, 11%–25%; 3, 26%–45%;
4, 46%–75%; and 5, >76%. At least 5–10 fields (×200 magnification) were
reviewed for each slide (42).
Immunofluorescence and optical sectioning microscopy. Kidneys from mice
were fixed in 1% PLP (1% paraformaldehyde, 1.4% DL-lysine, 0.2% sodium
periodate in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) (22) overnight, incubated in 30% sucrose
for 48 hours at 4°C, and embedded and frozen in OCT (Ted Pella Inc.).
Frozen sections (10 μm) were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and
nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% donkey serum and anti-mouse
CD16/32 (10 μg/ml; clone 2.4G2; StemCell Technologies Inc.). Sections
were labeled with rabbit anti-mouse CXCL1 (KC) antibody (2.5 μg/ml;
PeproTech Inc.) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, samples
were incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:500;
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and FITC-labeled anti-neu￾trophil monoclonal antibody (7 μg/ml; clone 7.4; Abcam) for 1 hour. All
specimens were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI
(Invitrogen). Images were acquired using the Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscopy
system with ApoTome imaging (Carl Zeiss). Image processing was achieved
using Zeiss AxioVision 4.6 software, and composite panoramic images were
obtained by manually stitching adjacent overlapping images together
using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe).
Statistics. GraphPad Instat 3 (GraphPad Inc.), SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Soft￾ware Inc.), andCanvasX(ACD Systems of America Inc.)were used to analyze
and present the data. Data were analyzed, after transformation if needed to
generate a normal distribution, by 2-tailed t test or 1- or 2-way ANOVA with
post-hoc analysis as appropriate. P < 0.05 was used to indicate significance.
