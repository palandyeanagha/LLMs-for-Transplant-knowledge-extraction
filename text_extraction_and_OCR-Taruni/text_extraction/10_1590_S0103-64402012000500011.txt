INTRODUCTION
Yeasts of Candida genus are normal constituents 
of the human flora, found as commensal on skin, 
genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts (1). These 
microorganisms can be isolated in the oral cavity of 
20% to 80% of healthy individuals (2,3). However, some 
factors, such as immunosuppression and use of broad￾spectrum antimicrobial drugs, can favor their overgrowth 
and the development of candidosis (4). Oral candidosis 
is a common problem among the elderly, denture wearers 
are more susceptible to the disease (5,6).
Products known as probiotics have been consumed 
for many years for therapeutic and prophylactic reasons. 
The presence of probiotic microorganisms in mucosa 
can prevent the growth of other bacterial species by

Imbalance in the resident microbiota may promote the growth of opportunistic microorganisms, such as yeasts of Candida genus and 
the development of diseases, especially in aged people. This study evaluated whether the consumption of the probiotic Yakult LB®
(Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve) was able to influence on the specific immunological response against Candida and 
on the presence of these yeasts in the oral cavity of 42 healthy aged individuals. Saliva samples were collected before and after the 
probiotic use for 30 days, 3 times a week. The samples were plated in Dextrose Saboraud Agar with chloramphenicol, the colony￾forming units (CFU/mL) were counted and the Candida species were identified. Anti-Candida IgA analysis was conducted using the 
ELISA technique. ANOVA and Student’s t-test were used for normally distributed data and the Wilcoxon test was used for data with 
non-normal distribution (α=0.05). The results showed a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in Candida prevalence (from 92.9% 
to 85.7%), in CFU/mL counts of Candida and in the number of non-albicans species after consumption of the probiotic. Immunological 
analysis demonstrated a significant increase (p<0.05) in anti-Candida IgA levels. In conclusion, probiotic bacteria reduced Candida
numbers in the oral cavity of the elderly and increased specific secretory immune response against these yeasts, suggesting its possible 
use in controlling oral candidosis.

Probiotics in Candida presence in elderly 535
Therefore, the aim of this study was investigate the effect 
of Yakult LB® consumption in Candida spp. presence and 
in anti-Candida IgA levels in the oral cavity of elderly.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Studied Population
After approval of the research project by the 
institutional Ethics Committee (Protocol #057/08), 42 
institutionalized women aged 65 or older who lived in 
the city of Taubaté, SP, Brazil, were clinically healthy 
and had not used antibiotics or immunossupressors 
for the previous 3 months were selected for the study. 
The sample size was determined considering: the 
total number of clinically healthy aged women of the 
institutions (n=50), 5% of error, 95% of confidence level 
and 80% of expected prevalence of Candida based on 
previous pilot study. Preliminary analyses regarding the 
oral and dental conditions were performed, including 
presence of periodontal disease, periodontal pockets and 
mucosal lesions. When these lesions were detected, the 
patients were included in the study and treated only after 
enrolment to avoid interference in the results. Patients 
with emergency conditions were not included and were 
treated immediately. If any new fact that could influence 
the results (e.g.: antibiotics use) emerged during the 
course of the study, the samples of that patient were also 
excluded. All participants and their caregivers were fully 
informed about the objectives and methodology of the 
study and signed an informed consent form.
Saliva Samples and Probiotic consumption
Samples of volunteers’ saliva were collected 
without stimulation, about 2 h after oral hygiene, in 
the morning or in the afternoon, depending on the 
rules designated by the institution. The samples were 
stored in sterile disposable collectors and kept on ice 
up to 3 h. Then, a fraction of the samples was plated in 
culture media for isolation and identification of Candida
yeasts. Another fraction was kept in a vial added of 
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1 mM (Sigma Co., 
St Louis, MO, USA) and sodium azide 0.1% (Difco 
Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI, USA) at -20ºC, for 
assessment of IgA levels. 
The caregivers were instructed to mix 1 g (content 
of 1 envelope) of the probiotic Yakult LB® (Yakult S/A 
Industria e Comércio, Caçapava, Brazil) (Lactobacillus 
casei and Bifidobacterium breve, 2x107 to 109 and 5x107
to 109 CFU/mL, respectively) with some kind of juice 
and give to the elderly 3 times a week, at the same hour, 
for 30 days. After this period, another saliva sample was 
collected from each participant.
Isolation, Counting and Identification of Candida 
Genus
The original samples or samples diluted 10-fold 
serially were plated in duplicate in Saboraud Dextrose 
Agar (Oxoid, Lawrence, KS, USA) with chloramphenicol 
(1 mg/mL) (Inlab, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) and incubated at 
37ºC for 48 h at room temperature for 5 days. The number 
of colony forming units per mL of saliva (CFU/mL) 
was counted. Suggestive colonies from each plate were 
confirmed by smear tests stained by the Gram technique. 
The Candida species were identified by phenotypic 
(germinative tube formation and chlamydoconidia 
production) and biochemistry tests (fermentation and 
assimilation of carbohydrates and urase test).
IgA Analyses
The levels of anti-Candida IgA were also 
analyzed using the ELISA technique. Sensitization of 
ELISA plates was performed using surface antigens 
from Candida cells, prepared as described by Koga-Ito 
et al. (11). The plates were then incubated with diluted 
saliva (1:10), followed by an anti-human IgA labeled 
with horseradish peroxidase. The reaction was developed 
with orthophenylenediamine and H2O2 as substrate. 
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
Statistical Analysis
First, the normality of the data (CFU/mL counts 
and IgA anti-Candida levels, before and after the use 
of probiotics) was evaluated using the D’Agostino test. 
ANOVA and Student’s t-test were used for normally 
distributed data while the Wilcoxon test was used for 
data with non-normal distribution. A significance level 
of 5% was established for all analyses.
RESULTS
The results showed a reduction in the prevalence 
of Candida in oral cavity of elderly, since 39 (92.9%) 
individuals carried the microorganism before probiotic

consumption and after that just 36 (85.7%). A statistically 
significant reduction in CFU/mL counts (p=0.02, 
Wilcoxon test) and in the log of CFU/mL counts (Fig. 1) 
(p=0.0, ANOVA test; p=0.03, Student’s t-test) was also 
observed. There was a reduction in Candida numbers in
57.1% of the elderly and total elimination of the yeasts 
in 11.9% of them. 
Among the identified species, C. albicans was 
the most frequently isolated one before and after the 
probiotics use. The species profile was slightly modified, 
since a reduction in the numbers of non-albicans species 
was observed (Table 1). 
Immunological analysis showed a significant 
increase in the levels of anti-Candida IgA (p=0.00, 
ANOVA test and p=0.01, Student’s t-test) (Fig. 2). The 
results showed that 26 (61.9%) individuals had their 
IgA levels increased, and from them 17 (65.4%) had 
a reduction in amounts of Candida in the oral cavity. 
DISCUSSION
With the increase in life expectation, works 
involving geriatrics are becoming more and more 
important. Being the aged population more susceptible 
to Candida colonization, it was expected to find a 
high prevalence of the fungus in the oral cavity of the 
studied individuals. Nevertheless, the results showed a 
reduction in the prevalence and counts of Candida after 
probiotic use. Santos et al. (12) had already observed 
a similar effect with the same product (Yakult LB®), 
but in a younger population. Hatakka et al. (10), also 
studying elderly, observed a decrease from 30% to 21% 
in the prevalence of Candida in oral cavity after the 
consumption of a cheese enriched with probiotic bacteria. 
Although Candida presence could be influenced by 
many factors, it is important to highlight that the older 
people of the present study maintained the same habits 
and were accompanied throughout the experiment by 
the caregivers of the institution, who administered the 
probiotic in a blind manner, i.e., without knowledge of 
the elderly. With this, the placebo effect was minimized, 
a study with a placebo group would be appropriate. The

quality of the samples could also contribute to variations. 
However, in the whole experiment, it was maintained 
the same time for the collection of the samples and the 
maximum of 3 h for processing them, reducing the risk 
of interferences.
The identification of analyses showed that C. 
albicans was the most prevalent species before and after 
the probiotic use. Its predominance in the oral cavity 
has been demonstrated (6,12,13). Several non-albicans 
species were also isolated, a phenomenon identified 
in long-term antibiotic users, immunossupressed and 
chronic pathologies patients (14-16). For example, 
Alberth et al. (15) observed the substitution of C. albicans
for non-albicans species (C. kefyr, C. lusitaniae, C. 
sake, C. tropicalis) in children with cancer, especially 
in the stages of severe neutropenia. Costa et al. (16) 
observed an increase in non-albicans species in HIV￾infected patients, although C. albicans was still the 
most frequent. Thus, the elderly of this work had a 
profile of Candida species more similar to patients with 
a predisposing factor. However, with the probiotic use 
there was a reduction in non-albicans species frequency, 
approximating the elderly to a healthy profile.
Controversial results regarding the role of 
secretory antibodies in the prevention of Candida
infections and the correlation of Candida and anti￾Candida IgA levels have been reported. Silva et al. 
(17) observed that patients with vaginal candidiasis 
showed lower levels of anti-Candida IgA in saliva when 
compared with the control group (absence of candidosis). 
In contrast, Kantardjiev and Popova (18) reported that 
the saliva samples of patients with denture stomatitis, 
mainly associated with Candida, showed higher titers 
of anti-Candida antibodies. 
The present results revealed that after the period 
of probiotics use, a significant increase in the levels 
of specific IgA was observed. According to Boirivant 
and Strober (19), probiotics can improve the defense 
function of epithelial cells by the induction of cytokine 
secretion and the production of immunoglobulins and 
antimicrobial substances. Since some individuals in this 
study did not present the yeast or showed diminished 
amounts in the oral cavity after probiotics use, it is likely 
that Candida elimination could have occurred due to 
secretory immunological stimulation. 
The maintenance and re-establishment of the 
internal balance, frequently compromised in older 
people, are the best alternative to avoid the development 
of candidosis and other opportunistic diseases. 
The findings of this study suggest that the periodic 
consumption of probiotics could help recovering this 
equilibrium and eliminating less adherent Candida
species, but with pathogenic potential.
RESUMO
Desequilíbrios na microbiota residente podem promover 
o crescimento de microrganismos oportunistas, como as 
leveduras do gênero Candida, e o desenvolvimento de doenças, 
especialmente na população idosa. Este estudo investigou se 
o consumo do probiótico Yakult LB® (Lactobacillus casei e
Bifidobacterium breve) era capaz de influenciar na resposta imune 
secretória anti-Candida e na presença destes microrganismos 
na cavidade bucal de 42 idosas saudáveis. Amostras de saliva 
foram coletadas antes e depois do consumo do probiótico por 30 
dias, 3 vezes por semana. As amostras foram semeadas em Agar 
Saboraud Dextrose com cloranfenicol, as unidades formadoras 
de colônias (UFC/mL) foram contadas e as espécies de Candida
foram identificadas. A análise de IgA anti-Candida foi realizada 
pela técnica ELISA. Os resultados demonstraram redução na 
prevalência de Candida (de 92,9% para 85,7%), na contagem 
de UFC/mL (p≤0,05) e no número de espécies não-albicans,
depois do consumo do probiótico. As análises imunológicas 
mostraram um aumento significativo dos níveis de IgA anti￾Candida (p≤0,05). Concluindo, as bactérias probióticas reduziram 
significantemente a quantidade de Candida na cavidade bucal 
dos idosos e aumentaram a resposta imune secretória específica 
para esta levedura, sugerindo a possibilidade de sua utilização 
no controle da candidose bucal.
