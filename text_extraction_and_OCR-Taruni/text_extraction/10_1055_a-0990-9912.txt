Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common pri￾mary hepatobiliary cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma. Ap￾proximately half the cases are located at the main confluence
of the hepatic ducts. Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT)
and computed tomography allow assessment of tumor location
and extension, liver parenchyma, the hepatic vascular system
and the volume of segments.
Hilar biliary stenoses should be classified according to Bis￾muth and Corlette because of important therapeutic implica￾tions. In this respect, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreato￾graphy (MRCP) is the diagnostic method of choice and provides
detailed information on involvement of the biliary tree.
The need for histological or cytological confirmation of CCA
should be discussed in a hepatobiliary tumor board. Endoscopic
ultrasound allows fine-needle aspiration or biopsies of a hilar
tumor mass. However, this approach is not recommended in
operable patients because of the potential risk of seeding tu￾mor cells. In most cases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan￾creatography (ERCP)-guided tissue acquisition is used for con￾firmation of CCA and differentiation from benign hilar steno￾ses. However, the sensitivity of ERCP-guided biopsies or brush
cytology is limited with rates of less than 60 % [1]. Fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for detection of pancreato￾biliary tract cancer are promising in improving the accuracy of
cytology brush samples [2]. Peroral cholangioscopy facilitates
targeted biopsies and the latest technologies promise higher
accuracy than ERCP-guided tissue acquisition [3]. In addition,
cholangioscopy provides identification of intraductal extension
of CCA, which has an impact on the indication for and extension
of surgical resection [4].
Resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) remains the
gold-standard treatment. However only 25 % to 35 % of patients
are candidates for radical resection. The majority of cases are
diagnosed in an advanced tumor stage or are functionally inop￾erable. Surgical treatment of HCCA is associated with a poten￾tially high risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Hyper￾bilirubinemia is regarded as the most important and modifiable
risk factor for negative early postoperative outcomes. A recent
retrospective single-center study reconfirmed that preopera￾tive bilirubin concentration is a significant risk factor for post￾operative morbidity and mortality with optimal cut-off levels
of 2.5mg/dL and 6.2mg/dL, respectively [5]. These results
may aid in decision-making with respect to preoperative biliary
drainage. Other risk factors for surgery include cholangitis,
malnutrition, need for portal vein embolization and predicted
future liver remnant volume ≤ 30 % following surgery. Preopera￾tive biliary drainage should be considered for these cases but
the selection criteria and route for preoperative biliary drainage
remain controversial. Routine preoperative drainage is not re￾commended [6, 7].
MRT and MRCP seem to be mandatory for assessment of lo￾cation and extension of hilar obstruction and selection of the
future liver remnant that is considered for preoperative biliary
drainage in patients with HCCA. Interventional access to liver
segments planned for resection usually should be avoided to
minimize risk of cholangitis. Endoscopic drainage as well as per￾cutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) are technically
much more difficult for HCCA than for distal malignant biliary
strictures. Therefore, they should be performed in high-volume
centers with a multidisciplinary hepatobiliary team [6]. Percu￾taneous access should be promptly available in case of failed
or incomplete endoscopic drainage.
Comparative studies on endoscopic versus percutaneous
biliary drainage of hilar obstruction show conflicting results.
Two meta-analyses of up to four retrospective non-randomized

ity for ERCP versus PTBD [8, 9]. On the other hand, a more re￾cent, retrospective study found that major postoperative mor￾bidity was more frequent after percutaneous versus endoscopic
drainage before major hepatic resection [10]. However, it
should considered that only 30 patients were exclusively mana￾ged with endoscopic biliary drainage and 141 of 171 patients
underwent at least one PTBD. There is only one multicenter,
randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared endoscopic
versus percutaneous biliary drainage in patients with resect￾able HCCA [11]. Patients who require major liver resection and
who had biliary obstruction of the future liver remnant (defined
as a bilirubin concentration > 2.9 mg/dL) were randomly as￾signed (1:1) to receive endoscopic biliary drainage or PTBD.
The primary outcome was the number of severe complications
between randomization and surgery in the intention-to-treat
population. The study was prematurely closed because of high￾er mortality in the PTBD group (41% of 27 patients) than in the
endoscopic biliary drainage group (11 % of 27 patients) with a
relative risk of 3.7 (P = 0.03). The rate of patients who required
additional PTBD after endoscopic biliary drainage was 56 %.
In this issue of the journal, Ba et al. report on a retrospective
cohort study in 180 patients with HCCA (bismuth type II, III and
IV) who underwent endoscopic (n = 99) or percutaneous trans￾hepatic preoperative biliary drainage (n = 81) [12]. Only pa￾tients with risk factors for major hepatic resection were includ￾ed. The authors did not report if MRCP was part of preinterven￾tional imaging for guidance of drainage. Selection criteria for
deciding between both routes were not mentioned. There
were no significant differences in patient characteristics be￾tween the groups. The main goal of intervention was drainage
of the future remnant liver lobe. Endoscopic drainage was done
with unilateral (n = 34) or bilateral (n = 46) endoprostheses or
nasobiliary drainage (n = 19). PTBD was performed with exter￾nal (n = 49) or internal-external drainage (n = 32).
The results showed no significant difference in decrease in
bilirubin between ERCP- and PTC-guided drainage. Compared
with the PTBD group, the ERCP group had a higher incidence
of procedure-related cholangitis (38 % vs. 22 %, P = 0.028) and
pancreatitis (17% vs. 2 %, P = 0.001); required more salvaged
biliary drainage (18 % vs. 6 %, P = 0.029), and incurred higher
costs (P < 0.05). Patients with type III and IV HC in the ERCP
group had more cholangitis than those in the PTBD group
(37 % vs. 18%, P = 0.018). The rate of cholangitis in patients
who received endoscopic bilateral biliary stents insertion was
higher than in patients with unilateral stenting (50% vs. 26%,
P = 0.034). PTBD internal-external drainage was associated
with a higher incidence of cholangitis than was only external
drainage (34% vs. 14%, P = 0.034). No significant difference in
the rate of cholangitis was observed between the endoscopic
unilateral stenting group and the endoscopic nasobiliary drain￾age group. The authors conclude that PTBD should be the pre￾ferred method for preoperative drainage in HCCA because of
significantly lower rates of adverse events (AEs) and lower hos￾pitalization costs compared to ERCP.
What does the study contribute to our current knowledge
about preoperative biliary drainage in patients with HCCA and
risk factors for major hepatic resection? Interpretation of the
results is difficult for several reasons. The criteria for selecting
patients in the ERCP or PTBD groups were not reported. ERCP
may have been preferred for tissue acquisition followed by
drainage. MRCP was not routinely performed for guidance of
drainage. This may increase risk of cholangitis, particularly in
the ERCP group because of unintended opacification of liver
segments that have otherwise not to be drained. Tissue acqui￾sition, lack of MRCP or lack of expertise could explain why bilat￾eral stents were implanted by ERCP in 58 % of the cases. In con￾trast, PTBD was performed with placement of a single catheter
for drainage of future remnant liver lobe in all cases. ERCP￾guided bilateral stenting doubled risk of cholangitis compared
to unilateral stenting. Interestingly, incidence of cholangitis
after unilateral stenting was similar to that for PTCD-guided
drainage (26 % vs 22 %). It also remains unclear why 18 % of pa￾tients in the ERCP group had to undergo salvage biliary drain￾age in spite of a high success rate and frequent placement of
two or more stents.
The authors of the study discuss other limitations of their
study, in particular, in terms of the retrospective and non-ran￾domized design and lack of long-term clinical outcomes. They
emphasize that a large, prospective, RCT is needed to compare
ERCP- with PTC-guided preoperative drainage in patients with
HCCA. However, as already mentioned, such a trial was prema￾turely closed because of a higher mortality in the PTBD group. It
seems unlikely that another large-scale prospective controlled
trial will be performed in the near future.
Conclusion
In conclusion, recommendations for indications and techniques
for preoperative biliary drainage in patients with HCCA are
based on a weak level of evidence. Patients should be referred
to centers with expertise in hepatic surgery and endoscopic as
well as radiological advanced interventional procedures. Ima￾ging findings, tumor resectability, patient-specific risk factors
and indications for tissue acquisition should be discussed by a
multidisciplinary team. ERCP with or without cholangioscopy
is the most accurate modality for tissue acquisition that may
be considered as part of the diagnostic approach. Drainage of
obstructed opacified liver segments has to be performed sub￾sequently to reduce risk of cholangitis. If major hepatic surgery
is planned without preoperative histological or cytological con￾firmation of HCCA, biliary drainage of the future liver remnant
should be strongly considered in patients with risk factors. The
route depends on local expertise in ERCP or PTBD and the duc￾tal anatomy demonstrated by MRCP. ERCP-guided drainage
seems to be as effective but safer than the percutaneous trans￾hepatic approach according to results of the only RCT. How￾ever, important technical details should be considered to re￾duce risk of AEs, in particular, in terms of cholangitis. They in￾clude separate cannulation and subsequent drainage of the ob￾structed future liver remnant. Any approach to liver segments
considered for resection should be avoided. Prophylactic anti￾biotic treatment is mandatory. PTBD for salvage drainage
should be limited to failures of decompression of targeted liver
segments or segments filled with contrast media that cannot

be drained by ERCP. The substantial risks of any preoperative
biliary intervention must be carefully balanced against the po￾tential benefits under close collaboration between experts in
interventional radiology and endoscopy.
