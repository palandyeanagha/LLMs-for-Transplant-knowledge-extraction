Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been associated to diabetes and obesity, but a possible association with the
metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its potential interaction with hepatitis is open to discussion.
Methods: We analysed data from an Italian case–control study, including 185 HCC cases and 404 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed from unconditional logistic regression models.
Results: Among the MetS components, diabetes and obesity (i.e, body mass index (BMI)X30 kg m 2
) were positively associated
to HCC risk, with ORs of 4.33 (95% CI, 1.89–9.86) and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.03–3.79), respectively. The ORs for the MetS were 4.06 (95% CI,
1.33–12.38) defining obesity as BMIX25, and 1.92 (95% CI, 0.38–9.76) defining it as BMIX30. The risk increased with the number of
MetS components, up to an almost four-fold excess risk among subjects with X2 MetS factors. Among subjects without chronic
infection with hepatitis B and/or C, the OR for those with X2 MetS components was over six-fold elevated. There was no
consistent association in subjects with serological evidence of hepatitis B and/or C infection.
Conclusion: This study found that the risk of HCC increases with the number of MetS components in subjects not chronically
infected with hepatitis viruses.
Worldwide, liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer
death among men and the sixth one among women (Llovet et al,
2003; London and McGlynn, 2006). Hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is the most frequent histologic type of primary liver cancer
(Stuver and Trichopoulos, 2008), accounting for up to 85% of
cases. The predominant role of chronic infection with hepatitis B
virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the aetiology of HCC
is well documented (Llovet et al, 2003; London and McGlynn,
2006; Mueller et al, 2006). Advanced age, male gender, heavy
alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking and cirrhosis are other
important recognised HCC risk factors (Llovet et al, 2003;
London & McGlynn, 2006; Mueller et al, 2006).
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a series of metabolically
related conditions, consistently associated with an increased risk of
cardiovascular diseases (Alberti et al, 2006, 2009). Since the late
90s, several definitions have been developed for MetS; these were
based on glucose intolerance–hyperglycemia–diabetes, obesity,
hypertension and dyslipidemia, but differed in the details and

criteria (Alberti and Zimmet, 1998; Third Report of the NCEP
Expert Panel, 2002; Alberti et al, 2005; Grundy et al, 2005). MetS
components reflect overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle resulting
in excess adiposity. A consensus statement by the major scientific
associations in the field of metabolic disorders proposed common
criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the MetS (‘joint interim
statement’), that is, the presence of at least three of the following
conditions: elevated waist circumference (for abdominal obesity),
elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose
(Alberti et al, 2009). Several epidemiological studies reported
positive associations between obesity and diabetes and the risk of
primary liver cancer, whereas data on the association with other
MetS components are scanty (Adami et al, 1996; Wideroff et al,
1997; Lagiou et al, 2000; El-Serag et al, 2004; Yuan et al, 2004; Lai
et al, 2006; Larsson and Wolk, 2007; Polesel et al, 2009). A limited
number of studies analysed the relationship between MetS and
liver cancer, suggesting a positive association (Russo et al, 2008;
Inoue et al, 2009; Borena et al, 2011; Welzel et al, 2011), but
quantification and particularly the possible relation between MetS
and HBV/HCV remain open to discussion.
We provided further results on this issue using data from a
multicentric case–control study conducted in Italy. In addition, we
explored the association between MetS and HCC risk among
subgroups of hepatitis-free and affected subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1999 and 2002, a case–control study on HCC was carried
out in the province of Pordenone (North-eastern Italy) and
in the city of Naples (southern Italy) (Talamini et al, 2004;
Franceschi et al, 2006; Montella et al, 2011b). Cases were subjects
younger than 85 years with incident HCC, admitted to teaching
and general hospitals in Pordenone and Naples. Out of the 261
HCC cases satisfying the inclusion criteria, 3 refused the
participation, 29 did not supply blood samples, and 44 did not
have anthropometric measures at cancer diagnosis. For the
remaining 185 cases (median age: 66 years, range: 43–84 years),
both questionnaire information and blood samples were
available. Most of the HCC cases (78.2%) were histologically or
cytologically confirmed; for the remaining cases, cancer diagnosis
was based on ultrasound, tomography and elevated a-fetoprotein
levels.
Controls were patients younger than 85 years admitted to the
same hospitals for a wide spectrum of acute, non-neoplastic
conditions. Patients whose hospital admission was due to diseases
related to alcohol and tobacco, liver diseases (e.g., hepatitis,
cirrhosis, and oesophageal varices) or other chronic diseases, which
may have substantially modified their lifestyle, were excluded from
the comparison group. Overall, 467 controls were contacted and
462 accepted to participate. Blood samples were available from 431
controls, and 404 provided information on body size (median age:
65 years, range: 40–82 years). Twenty-six per cent of controls were
admitted for traumas, 25% for acute surgical conditions, 24% for
nontraumatic orthopaedic diseases, 14% for eye diseases, and 10%
for other illnesses.
Each case and control provided a 15-ml blood sample the same
day of the interview. Sera were screened for antibodies against
HCV (anti-HCV) using a third-generation MEIA (AxSYM HCV
version 3.0; Abbott Diagnostic Division, Wiesbaden, Germany)
and for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using microparticle
enzyme immunoassay (AxSYM HBsAg version 2.0; Abbott
Diagnostic Division). All study participants signed an informed
consent form, according to the recommendations of the Board of
Ethics of the National Cancer Institute of Aviano.
Cases and controls were interviewed during their hospital stay
using a structured questionnaire including information on socio￾demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits (e.g., tobacco smoking
and alcohol drinking), usual diet, personal medical history, and
family history of cancer. Self-reported information on height and
weight at different ages was collected, and body mass index (BMI)
was computed according to Quetelet’s index (weight/height2
,
kg m 2
). As information on waist circumference was not available,
abdominal obesity was defined using BMI, according to two
different thresholds, that is, X25 and X30 kg m 2
. History of
medical conditions, including type-2 diabetes, drug-treated hyper￾tension, and drug-treated or clinical diagnosis of hypercholester￾olaemia was self-reported, and included age at first diagnosis.
Diseases whose onset was o1 year before hospital admission were
not considered.
The indicator of MetS was defined according to the criteria
agreed in the 2009 joint interim statement (Alberti et al, 2009),
adapted to our data, as the presence of at least three components
among the following: (1) abdominal obesity, (2) history of a clinical
diagnosis or drug-treated hypercholesterolaemia (as a proxy
indicator of increased low-density lipoprotein/reduced HDL
cholesterol levels), (3) history of drug-treated hypertension (as an
alternate indicator of elevated blood pressure), and (4) history of
diabetes. We also considered various components of the MetS
separately.
Data analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) of HCC, and the corresponding
95% confidence intervals (CIs), for MetS, its components or
various combination of components, were derived using uncondi￾tional multiple logistic regression models, including terms for
centre, sex, age (o55, 55–64, 65–74, X75 years), education
(o7, 7–11, X12 years), alcohol drinking status (never, ex,
current), and maximum lifetime alcohol intake (o21, X21 drinks
per week), smoking habits (never, ex, current: o15 cigarettes per
day, current: X15 cigarettes per day), HBsAg and/or anti-HCV
positivity, and non-alcohol energy intake.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the distribution of 185 cases of HCC and 404
controls according to centre, age, sex, and other covariates.
Controls were more often females and were younger than cases.
Cases were more likely than controls to have a low level of edu￾cation, to smoke cigarettes, and to report heavy alcohol drinking;
147 cases (79%) and 44 controls (11%) had serological evidence of
chronic infection with HBV and/or HCV.
Table 2 reports the ORs of HCC according to separate and
combined components of the MetS. The OR for diabetes was
4.33 (95% CI, 1.89–9.86); no association emerged with treated
hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. The ORs were 1.25 (95%
CI, 0.72–2.18) for BMI X25 kg m 2 and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.03–3.79)
for BMI X30 kg m 2
. When obesity was defined as BMI
X25 kg m 2
, as compared with subjects without any MetS
component, the OR was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.47–1.74) for those with
one MetS component, and 1.74 (95% CI, 0.82–3.69) for those with
X2 components (P for trend ¼ 0.149). The OR for the indicator of
MetS was 4.06 (95% CI, 1.33–12.38). When obesity was defined as
BMIX30 kg m 2
, the ORs were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.64–2.15) and 3.46
(95% CI, 1.54–7.73) for those with one and X2 MetS components,
respectively (P for trend ¼ 0.009). The OR for the presence of the
MetS indicator was 1.92 (95% CI, 0.38–9.76).

infection with HBV and/or HCV and with a lifetime alcohol intake
o21 drinks per week. Results are given for obesity defined as BMI
X30 kg m 2
. Diabetes showed an about three-fold increase in risk
of HCC in subjects with and without chronic hepatitis, although
the association was significant in the HBsAg  and anti-HCV 
group only; obesity and the number of MetS components were
associated to HCC in hepatitis-free subjects only, in particular, in
those with moderate alcohol consumption.
The combined effect of overweight (i.e., BMI X25 kg m 2
) and
diabetes on HCC risk is shown in Figure 1. Compared with the
lowest risk category, that is normal-weight subjects without
diabetes, the ORs were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.63–2.06) for overweight
subjects without diabetes, 4.38 (95% CI, 0.84–22.88) for diabetics of
normal weight, and 4.75 (95% CI, 1.75–12.89) for those with both
conditions.
DISCUSSION
In this Italian data set, the risk of HCC increased with the number
of MetS components, up to an almost four-fold excess risk among
subjects with X2 MetS factors, and to over six-fold in subjects
without markers of chronic infection with HBV and/or HCV.
There was no consistent association in subjects HBsAg þ or anti￾HVC þ . Metabolic syndrome is a general definition including
several factors linked to overweight and hyperinsulinemia. Of
these, only diabetes and overweight/obesity were associated to
HCC risk in this study, although the relation with BMI was
influenced by the threshold chosen. However, inference on
hypercholesterolaemia was limited by the availability of informa￾tion on treated subjects only, who were infrequent in Italy at the
time of data collection, and data on hypertension were related to
drug-treated hypertension only.
Our results are in broad agreement with previous data on the
issue, which showed a positive association of MetS with liver
cancer (Russo et al, 2008; Inoue et al, 2009; Borena et al, 2011;
Welzel et al, 2011). When the single MetS components were
analysed separately, overweight/obesity and high blood glucose
revealed the strongest associations with liver cancer (Inoue et al,
2009; Borena et al, 2011).
Of specific interest, we found an association between the
number of MetS components and HCC risk only among subjects
without markers of chronic infection with HBV and/or HCV. In
the Japan Public Health center-based prospective Study Cohort II,
MetS increased the risk of HCC also among subjects with HCV
infection (Inoue et al, 2009). In that study, among the single
metabolic factors, only overweight was, however, positively
associated to HCC risk in anti-HCV þ subjects. A 14 years
follow-up study in Taiwan recruiting 23 820 subjects, for a total of
291 HCC cases, found that obesity (i.e., BMI X30 kg m 2
) and
central obesity (i.e., waist circumference 490 in men and 480 in
women) were independently associated with a two-fold and a four￾fold increased HCC risk among HCV-seropositive subjects,
respectively (Chen et al, 2008). In the same study, diabetes was
associated with a two- to three-fold increased HCC risk, regardless
of the presence of chronic infection with hepatitis viruses.
However, the risk was highest in HBsAg  and anti-HCV þ
subjects (Chen et al, 2008).
Diabetes and obesity have been previously related to HCC risk.
This study considers the role of their combined effect in the
MetS, and their interaction, as well as the modifying effect of HBV
and/or HCV on the relation between MetS and liver cancer risk.
Diabetes, in fact, has been associated with an about two-fold
increased risk of HCC (La Vecchia et al, 1994; Adami et al, 1996;
La Vecchia et al, 1997; Wideroff et al, 1997; Lagiou et al, 2000; El￾Serag et al, 2004; Yuan et al, 2004; Lai et al, 2006; Polesel et al,
2009; La Vecchia, 2011; Bosetti et al, 2012), and precedes the
development of both cirrhosis and HCC (Tanaka et al, 1997;
Dellon and Shaheen, 2005; London and McGlynn, 2006). Insulin
resistance has been related to the accumulation of liver fat and
to excess cancer risk through the insulin-related growth factors
(La Vecchia et al, 2011).

With reference to obesity, a meta-analysis, including 46000
cases from 10 cohort studies, showed an 89% excess HCC risk
among obese (i.e, BMI, X30 kg m 2
) compared with subjects of
normal weight; the pooled relative risk associated to overweight
(BMI ranging from 25 to 30 kg m 2
) was 1.17 (95% CI, 1.02–1.34).
The excess risk of liver cancer associated with overweight/
obesity and diabetes has been related to the development of non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Sanyal et al, 2010). NAFLD
is characterised by excess fat accumulation in the liver, and ranges
from isolated hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), the more aggressive form of fatty liver disease, which can
progress to cirrhosis and HCC (Neuschwander-Tetri and Caldwell,
2003; Larsson and Wolk, 2007; Siegel and Zhu, 2009; Montella
et al, 2011a). However, NAFLD/NASH increases HCC risk even in
the absence of cirrhosis (Ertle et al, 2011). Adipose tissue secretes a
variety of bioactive hormones, collectively referred to as adipo￾kines, which produce vascular endothelial growth factor, which
may contribute to tumour progression (Rega et al, 2007). Excess

intracellular fatty acids, adenosine triphosphate depletion, oxidant
stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction may cause hepatocellular
injuries in the steatotic liver (Neuschwander-Tetri and Caldwell,
2003).
To limit possible sources of bias, we included in the control
group subjects admitted for a wide spectrum of acute, non￾neoplastic conditions, unrelated to the major risk factors for HCC.
The practically complete participation rate and the comparable
catchment areas of cases and controls contributed to reduce any
potential selection bias. Cases may recall history of disease more
frequently than controls. However, the hospital setting should have
improved the comparability of information, as cases and controls
are interviewed under similar conditions (Breslow and Day, 1980).
Among limitations, information on MetS components was
based on self-reported data from a questionnaire, which collected
history of diabetes, treated hypertension, and treated hyperlipi￾daemia, rather than direct measurements of fasting plasma glucose,
blood pressure, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Underestima￾tion of the prevalence of MetS may therefore have occurred.
However, data on diabetes collected on our questionnaire were
satisfactorily reliable, with a k statistic of 0.85 from almost 300
subjects interviewed twice (Bosetti et al, 2001). Moreover, a recent
cohort study from Spain showed that self-declared data on the
criteria of MetS and on MetS itself are sufficiently accurate for
epidemiological inference (Barrio-Lopez et al, 2011). Validation
studies of hypertension confirmed with a medical examination
found a reasonable accuracy of self-reported information; a
somewhat lower validity was usually found for self-reported
hypercholesterolaemia (Colditz et al, 1986; Giles et al, 1995;
Vargas et al, 1997; Martin et al, 2000). Weight also was self￾reported and possibly underestimated, particularly in overweight
and obese subjects (Stark et al, 1981; Stewart, 1982; Millar, 1986).
However, such information bias is likely to be similar for cases and
controls, and, consequently, should have led to an attenuation of
the real association (Breslow and Day, 1980). In addition,
information on presence of fatty liver/NAFLD/NASH was not
available in our study.
Another possible limitation is the use of BMI as a proxy of waist
circumference in defining people with central obesity. However,
the World Health Organization, in its formulation of MetS
diagnostic criteria, considered BMI as a valid proxy of waist-to￾hip ratio (Alberti et al, 2006). In our analyses, abdominal obesity
was defined as either BMI X25 or BMI X30 kg m 2
, and the
excess risk associated to the MetS persisted even when the lower
threshold was considered. We used one of the possible MetS
definition proposed in the literature (Alberti et al, 2009). When the
presence of MetS was defined according to the International
Diabetes Federation criteria (Third Report of the NCEP Expert
Panel, 2002) (adapted to our data) as the presence of central
obesity plus at least two other components, the OR for the

Figure 1. Distribution of 185 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 404
controls, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according
to the combination of diabetes and overweight. Italy, 1999–2002. ORs
were estimated from unconditional logistic regression model adjusted
for centre, sex, age, education, drinking status, maximum lifetime
alcohol intake, smoking habits, HBsAg and/or anti-HCV positivity, and
non-alcohol energy intake. Overweight was defined as BMI

indicator of MetS did not substantially change (OR ¼ 2.12, 95% CI,
0.40–11.26, with obesity defined as BMI X30 kg m 2
; OR ¼ 4.36,
95% CI, 1.40–13.56, with obesity defined as BMI X25 kg m 2
).
The different prevalence of chronic hepatitis infection with
HBV/HCV between HCC cases and controls, and the relatively low
prevalence of obesity (i.e., BMI X30 kg m 2
) and other MetS
components in our study sample, limited our results on these
associations, particularly in subgroup analyses. In light of these
considerations, caution in interpreting these results is needed.
Concerning confounding, the associations persisted after
adjustment for the main recognised HCC risk factors, including
chronic infection with HBV/HCV, tobacco smoking, and alcohol
drinking.
