Gastrointestinal hormones in short bowel
syndrome. Peptide YY may be the 'colonic brake'
to gastric emptying

Abstract
Background-Short bowel patients with a
jejunostomy have large volume stomal
outputs, which may in part be due to rapid
gastric emptying of liquid. Short bowel
patients with a preserved colon do not
have such a high stool output and gastric
emptying of liquid is normal.
Aims-To determine if differences in the
gastric emptying rate between short bowel
patients with and without a colon can be
related to gastrointestinal hormone
changes after a meal.
Subjects-Seven short bowel patients with
no remaining colon (jejunal length 30-
160 cm) and six with jejunum in continuity
with a colon (jejunal length 25-75 cm), and
12 normal subjects.
Methods-The subjects all consumed a
640 kcal meal; blood samples were taken
for 180 minutes for measurement of
gastrointestinal hormones.
Results-Patients with a colon had high
fasting peptide YY values (median 71
pmoIIl with a colon; 11 pmoIIl normal
subjects, p<0005) with a normal post￾prandial rise, but those without a colon
had a low fasting (median 7 pmol/l,
p=0076) and a reduced postprandial pep￾tide YY response (p<0.050). Motilin values
were high in some patients without a
colon. In both patient groups fasting and
postprandial gastrin and cholecystokinin
values were high while neurotensin values
were low. There were no differences
between patient groups and normal
subjects in enteroglucagon, pancreatic
polypeptide, or somatostatin values.
Conclusions-Low peptide YY values in
short bowel patients without a colon may
cause rapid gastric emptying of liquid.
High values of peptide YY in short bowel
patients with a retained colon may slow
gastric emptying of liquid and contribute
to the 'colonic brake'.

Keywords: short bowel syndrome, peptide hormones,
peptide YY, satiety.
Patients with a short remaining length of small
intestine divide into two common clinical
groups: those with a jejunostomy and those
with jejunum in continuity with a colon.1
Both patient groups have problems with nutri￾ent absorption; jejunostomy patients have
additional major problems in maintaining
fluid balance as they lose large volumes of
water, sodium, and magnesium from their
stoma.' 2 Some of the jejunostomy output is
due to a loss of the normal daily secretions,
produced in response to food2; some may
be due to rapid gastric emptying of liquid,3
and some due to increased gastrointestinal
secretions, such as gastric acid.4
In short bowel patients with and without a
colon, the head of the liquid phase of a meal
travels more rapidly from the stomach to the
stoma or colon than in normal subjects.3
Following this initial rapid transit, gastric
emptying of liquid in those with a colon
becomes normal, while in those without a colon
it remains fast.3 This finding suggests that the
arrival of liquid in the colon, by a neural or
humoral mechanism, is activating a 'colonic
brake' that slows subsequent gastric emptying.
To determine if there may be a hormonal
contribution to differences in gastric emptying
rate and gastrointestinal secretions between
short bowel patients with and without a colon,
we have measured plasma gastrointestinal hor￾mone values after a meal in such patients and
in normal subjects.
Methods
NORMAL SUBJECTS
Twelve normal healthy volunteers (eight
women and four men) with a mean age of 33
years (range 19-53) and taking no medications
were studied. None had gastrointestinal sym￾ptoms or previous abdominal surgery.
PATIENTS (TABLE I)
All patients had had a previous resection of
their ileum and part of their jejunum. The
patients were clinically stable and well when
studied at a median time of 48 months (range
3-181 months) after their last intestinal resec￾tion. All were maintaining a stable nutritional,
fluid, and electrolyte status and all were taking
an unrestricted oral diet. All the patients,
except patient J, were well nourished and had
a body mass index within the normal range.
All patients with previous inflammatory bowel
disease had no evidence of current active
disease as assessed clinically, biochemically or
radiologically. No patient had had gastric
surgery. Bowel length was measured at opera￾tion in nine and radiologically in four
patients.5

Short bowel with no colon
Six patients with an end jejunostomy and one
patient with a jejunorectal anastomosis were
included in this group. Four of them had less
than 100 cm of jejunum remaining, of whom
three required longterm home parenteral
nutrition. The other four patients required oral
electrolyte or nutritional supplements to main￾tain fluid balance and nutritional status.
Short bowel with a colon
Six patients with most of their colon in situ
were studied. Two had their jejunum anasto￾mosed to a short length of terminal ileum (15
cm of ileum in patient L, and 5 cm in patient
M), and had a retained ileocaecal valve and
whole colon, two had jejunum anastomosed to
the caecum, and two jejunum anastomosed to
the proximal transverse colon. Two patients,
both with jejunal lengths of 25 cm, were receiv￾ing longterm home intravenous nutrition. Two
others took oral nutritional supplements and
two others required no fluid or nutritional
supplements.
STUDY DESIGN
Antisecretory drugs omeprazole (patient B),
octreotide (patient A), and ranitidine (patients
C and D) were stopped five, three, and one
day respectively prior to the study. The anti￾diarrhoeal drugs codeine or loperamide, or both,
(all patients except A, B, H, and I) were stopped
the evening before the study; these drugs were
not stopped earlier because of potential drug
withdrawal symptoms. Women were studied
during the first half of the menstrual cycle.
A standardised test meal of a pancake and
orange juice was chosen; total weight 415 g,
energy 640 kcal, carbohydrate 80 g, fat 27 g,
protein 18 g, potassium 20 mmol, sodium 6
mmol, fibre 1 g. After fasting from midnight
the meal was eaten in the morning (about 10
am) over 10 minutes then the orange juice
(195 ml) was drunk. Time 0 is taken as the
time of starting to eat the meal. Blood samples
were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and
180 minutes for hormone assays. Nothing else
was eaten or drunk for the following six hours.
The patients on home parenteral nutrition had
stopped their infusion at least two and a half
hours before the study.
Liquid and solid gastric emptying and small
bowel transit were determined during this study;
the results have been published previously.3
This study was approved by the ethical
committee of the City and Hackney District
Health Authority and all subjects gave
informed consent.
HORMONE ANALYSIS
Ten ml blood samples for hormone assays were
taken into heparinised tubes containing 4000
kallikrein inactivator units of aprotinin (0.2 ml
Trasylol). Plasma was separated within 15
minutes of sampling and frozen at -20°C until
time of assay. The plasma values of
neurotensin, motilin, enteroglucagon, pancre￾atic polypeptide, gastrin, peptide YY, cholecys￾tokinin, and somatostatin were all measured by
radioimmunoassays.6-8The median fasting and
peak values, and the integrated response (IR)
were determined for each hormone.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to
compare each group of patients with normal
subjects at all sample times.
Results
TOLERANCE OF PROCEDURE
All normal subjects ate the meal within 10
minutes with no difficulty. Most of the short
bowel patients had problems consuming the
meal; patient A with no colon could not eat all
of the pancake even after 20 minutes and left
80 g. Three patients with a colon had con￾siderable difficulty in finishing the meal: one
(J) left 63 g after 25 minutes, two others (H
and I) took 12 and 20 minutes to finish the
meal. No subject had any problem drinking the
orange juice.
PLASMA HORMONE VALUES (TABLE II)
Neurotensin
There was a tendency for fasting and post￾prandial values of neurotensin to be lower in
both patient groups than controls (Fig 1). In
those without a colon, fasting (Fig 2) and
peak neurotensin values correlated with the
remaining length of jejunum (fasting: r=0-86,
p<0 05, peak: r=0.89, p<0 05).
Motilin
Motilin values in patients without a colon were
significantly higher than in normal subjects at
0, 90, 120, and 180 minutes (p<0.05) (Fig 3).
However those, with the most rapid gastric
emptying of liquid and the shortest remaining
lengths of jejunum, had motilin values within
the normal range.

Peptide YY
Patients with a colon had high fasting peptide
YY values (median 71 pmol/l) compared with
normal subjects (median 11 pmoVl, p<0 005),
and peptide YY values were raised at all time
points (p<0 005 except 15 minutes when
p<005). The integrated response was normal
(Fig 4).
Patients without a colon had low fasting
peptide YY values (median 7 pmol/l, p=0 076)
and a reduced integrated response (p<005)
and at all time points peptide YY was less than
in normal subjects (p<0 05 except 60 minutes
when p=0.06).
Gastrin
Fasting gastrin values were significantly higher
in both groups of patients than in normal
subjects (p<0 05). In those without a colon
gastrin values at 30, 60, and 180 minutes and
the integrated response were also significantly
higher than in normal subjects (p<005).
Cholecystokinin
In both patient groups cholecystokinin values
(Fig 5) were significantly (p<0 05) higher than
in normal subjects at 0 and 180 minutes and
additionally in those without a colon at 90
minutes.
Pancreatic polypeptide
Fasting and postprandial pancreatic polypep￾tide values were not significantly different, in
either group, from normal subjects.
Somatostatin
Fasting and postprandial somatostatin values
were not significantly different, in either group,
from normal subjects.

(for example, with a proton pump inhibitor or

unlikely. One patient without a colon had
stopped taking 20 mg omeprazole daily, five
days before the study. This time period should
have allowed serum gastrin concentrations to

high pancreatic polypeptide, neurotensin or
somatostatin values, or low cholecystokinin
values.
Cholecystokinin may be important in caus￾ing satiety40-42 and the high concentrations
observed in both groups of patient may have
contributed to four of the 13 short bowel
patients (three with a colon) experiencing diffi￾culty in finishing the meal. This did not occur
in any of the 12 normal subjects.
Pronounced ileal adaptation after a jejunal
resection occurs in animals. In patients with a
retained colon the evidence for structural4344
and functional45 jejunal adaptation is scarce.
Adaptation in patients with a jejunostomy may
not occur.46 Enteroglucagon is trophic to the
small bowel.47-50 In this study, neither fasting
nor postprandial concentrations of entero￾glucagon were raised in either group of patients.
If jejunal hyperplasia occurs in patients with a
retained colon it is unlikely to be due to
enteroglucagon. It is interesting that, although
produced by the same cells, peptide YY and
enteroglucagon values do not mirror each
other.9 10 The low neurotensin concentrations
observed could reduce jejunal adaptation.5'
In summary, in short bowel patients with
and without a colon, high serum gastrin con￾centrations may cause gastric acid hypersecre￾tion and high cholecystokinin values may
account for satiety. Low neurotensin values, in
both patient groups, may predispose to a rapid
gastrointestinal transit of liquid. Low peptide
YY values in short bowel patients without a
colon may be partly responsible for the high
volume of jejunostomy output. High peptide
YY values in those with a retained colon may
slow gastric emptying and so contribute to the
'colonic brake'.
