COVID-19 is a viral illness caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is highly contagious virus with human-to-human 
transmission being primarily attributed to direct contact or air droplets. It is highly 
infectious and contagious due to high-viable viral loads in the upper respiratory tract 
secretions of infected patients and also similar viral load being detected in both asymp￾tomatic and symptomatic patients. The virus stability characteristics and modes of 
transmission via fomites and air droplets make gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy a high￾risk procedure for COVID-19 transmission. This review discusses the currently available 
literature on risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during GI endoscopy.

Introduction
In December 2019, Wuhan city of Hubei province, 
China, reported a cluster outbreak of viral pneumonia 
that was subsequently confirmed to be caused by a new 
coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it 
was termed as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by 
World Health Organization (WHO).1,2
 Coronaviruses are 
a group of related medium-sized viruses that are envel￾oped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses which 
cause respiratory illnesses in the humans.3,4
 The name 
Coronavirus is derived from the crown or halo-like appear￾ance of virion on electron microscopy. This appearance is 
due to large bulbous projections of envelope glycoproteins 
on its surface.5
 The human respiratory disease is usually 
caused by six species of Coronavirus, and a majority of 
them cause self-limiting mild respiratory illness. However, 
occasionally, they can cause fatal pneumonia, as was seen 
in 2002 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavi￾rus (SARS-CoV), and in 2012 with Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.1,4
 The novel SARS-CoV-2 
is also a highly infectious and contagious virus that has 
potential to cause severe and fatal disease in humans.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, 
fatiguability and respiratory tract symptoms such as cough 
and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, 
mainly diarrhea and vomiting, have also been reported 
in some studies.2,6-8
 Minority of patients with COVID-19 
develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 
fatality rate of up to 3.5% has been reported consequent to 
septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation 
dysfunction.2,6-8
 Older people and patients with underlying 
comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic 
lung diseases, and malignancies are more likely to develop 
serious illness as well as fatality.1
 Currently, there is neither 
an effective treatment nor a vaccine for prevention of infec￾tion with SARS-CoV-2, although there are many ongoing clin￾ical trials with potential drugs. The only effective preventive 
measure currently is effective infection control, personal 
hygiene, and isolation.
Modes of Transmission of SARS-CoV-2
Initial studies indicated that SARS-CoV-2 occurred because 
of animal-to-human transmission, as the authors found 
linkage between wild animal market and its occurrence.9
However, subsequently, human-to-human transmission

was also confirmed.1
 Human-to-human transmission has 
been primarily attributed to direct contact or air droplets.4,6,8
Respiratory tract infections can be transmitted through air 
droplets of varying sizes. The droplet particles > 5 to 10 μm 
in diameter are termed as respiratory droplets and drop￾lets < 5 μm in diameter are termed as droplet nuclei.1
 The 
currently available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is 
primarily transmitted between people through respiratory 
droplets and contact routes.1,4,6,8-11 It is important to under￾stand the difference between respiratory droplets and drop￾let nuclei. The airborne transmission suggests transmission 
of infection by infected droplet nuclei. As mentioned above, 
droplet nuclei are < 5 μm in diameter and can remain in the 
air for long periods of time and also transmitted over dis￾tances > 1 m.1
 The size of the exhaled aerosol depends upon 
many factors including the characteristics of the fluid, force 
and pressure at the moment of emission of aerosol, and 
surrounding environmental conditions like temperature, 
humidity and air flow. The particles of large size remain in 
air for a brief period and usually settle within 1 m from the 
emitting source, whereas droplet nuclei remain suspended in 
air for longer periods of time.1
The droplet transmission of viral illnesses usually occurs 
when a person is in in close contact (usually within 1 m) 
with someone who has active viral shedding in respiratory 
secretions, and activities like coughing or sneezing generate 
infective air droplets. These infective air droplets can infect 
surrounding person through his/her exposed mucosae (mouth 
and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes).1
 The transmission can also 
occur through infected fomites like stethoscope, thermometer, 
or endoscope. The viability period of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites 
is variable with a study demonstrating it to be detectable for 
72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, but the viability period 
being less on copper and cardboard surfaces.12
The worrying aspect of COVID-19 transmission is that in 
certain clinical situation airborne transmission may also be 
possible. The airborne transmission may be possible during 
procedures that generate aerosols like nebulization, endo￾tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, manual 
ventilation before intubation, disconnecting patient from the 
ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, trache￾ostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.1,13 A study using 
a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum 
to create an aerosolized environment demonstrated that the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus remains viable in aerosols for a period of 
up to 3 hours (duration of the experiment).12 There are also 
reports of detection of viral RNA in various environmental 
samples both for SARS-CoV-1 as well as SARS-CoV-2.12,14 van 
Doremalen et al demonstrated that the stability of SARS￾CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV-1.12 Although con￾cerning, detection of viral RNA in environmental samples 
is not indicative of viable transmissible virus, and further 
studies are required to find out whether viable SARS-CoV-2 
virus is present in air samples from room with COVID-19 
patients, where no aerosol-generating procedures are being 
conducted.
Although having similar stability to SARS-CoV-1, 
COVID-19 is more infectious and contagious. This difference 
is possibly due to high-viable viral loads in the upper respira￾tory tract (nose more than the throat) and also similar viral 
load being detected in both asymptomatic and symptomatic 
patients.15,16 This potential of SARS-CoV-2 to shed and trans￾mit even in asymptomatic patient is one of the key factors 
responsible for its rapid spread across the continents.1,16
There are also reports of fecal shedding of COVID-19 virus, 
both in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and this 
raises concern of a fecal-oral route of transmission.7,17 Despite 
this, there have been no reports of fecal–oral transmission 
of SARS-CoV-2 to date.1,4,6
 Salivary glands being a potential 
reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 is also a matter of concern.18 There 
is also report of aircraft transmission of COVID-19, raising 
concerns of its transmission in closed spaces.19
Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission During 
Endoscopy
Currently, there is no report of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 
transmission through endoscopy. However, the virus 
stability characteristics and modes of transmission, as 
described above, make GI endoscopy a high-risk procedure 
for COVID-19 transmission. The possible ways COVID-19 
transmission can occur in an endoscopy suite include per￾son-to-person via direct contact, as endoscopy involves close 
contact with the patients or respiratory droplets, generation 
of infected aerosols during endoscopy, and through contact 
with contaminated endoscopic equipment, accessories and 
body fluids.20 It is important to understand that both upper 
and lower GI endoscopy procedures carry the risk of trans￾mission of COVID-19.
Why Staff in Endoscopy Units are at High-Risk of 
Acquiring COVID-19?
There are many factors that put the staff in endoscopy unit at 
high-risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. First, endoscopy 
suites are relatively small and closed units with several people 
including endoscopists, nursing staff, technicians, anesthe￾tists, hospital attendants, patients waiting for multiple pro￾cedures, and large number of small and big equipment. Both 
these factors are part of an ideal recipe for person-to-person 
as well as fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Theoretically, a 
patient with high-viral load in the respiratory secretions can 
contaminate the endoscopy suite’s air as well as fomites with 
virus that can remain viable for a longer duration, thus putting 
uninfected patients as well as endoscopy staff at risk. Second, 
a variety of endoscopic procedures including gastroscopy, 
colonoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancrea￾tography are performed every day, wherein the endoscopists 
access the GI lumen from a close distance and therefore get 
exposed to a large number of respiratory, oropharyngeal and 
gastrointestinal flora.21,22 Also, many of these procedures are 
of significantly longer duration, and this further increases the 
risk of infection to the endoscopist. Johnston et al reported a 
significant unrecognized exposure to the endoscopist's face 
of potentially infectious biologic samples during endoscopy.23
Also, unrecognized contamination was observed on the walls 
of endoscopy suites. Moreover, fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2,

especially in asymptomatic patients, opens an altogether 
new dimension in its transmission. Although, currently there 
are no reports of feco–oral transmission of COVID-19, viral 
fecal shedding is a matter of concern because viable virion in 
the stool could increase the risk of transmission to endoscopy 
staff during colonoscopy.
Third, gastrointestinal endoscopy is a procedure than can 
generate aerosols. Although there are no studies that have sys￾tematically looked at the type and frequency of aerosol gener￾ation during endoscopy, endoscopy should be considered as an 
aerosol-generating procedure.20,24 It is known that coughing and 
retching can occur during upper endoscopy and this is known 
to generate aerosols. Similarly, while doing colonoscopy, pas￾sage of flatus may disseminate infective microorganisms into 
the surroundings.25 Moreover, routine maneuvers done while 
performing endoscopy, including suctioning and multiple 
exchanges of catheters/accessories, increases the risk of splash￾ing and spread of infective material to the endoscopy staff.20
Fourth, SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in the gastric, duo￾denal and rectal biopsies, and this is also a potential source of 
infection in an endoscopy setting.17
As SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via fomites also, there is 
a risk of transmission of virus to uninfected patients via con￾taminated endoscopes, as happened previously with hepatitis 
B and C and various multidrug resistant organisms. However, it 
appears that current disinfection and reprocessing guidelines as 
advocated by American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 
and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy are suffi￾cient to disinfect the endoscopes from SARS-CoV-2 also.24,26,27
Conclusion
The virus stability characteristics and modes of transmis￾sion of SARS-CoV-2 make GI endoscopy a high-risk proce￾dure for COVID-19 transmission There is an explosion of 
knowledge on various transmission kinetics of COVID-19, 
and several guidelines and recommendations for its preven￾tion in endoscopy suites have been advocated. However, the 
screening protocols prior to endoscopy include the consid￾erable challenges of identifying asymptomatic, minimally 
symptomatic patients shedding virus in their secretions, or 
patients shedding virus even after the resolution of symp￾toms. Despite these concerns, the results of recent study 
from Italy have demonstrated that the risk for both patients 
and health care workers to acquire clinically relevant 
COVID-19 infection during endoscopy appears to be low.28
The authors speculated that this low risk suggests that as 
relatively simple measures, such as use of double-surgical 
masks could prevent infection in endoscopy, airborne drop￾lets rather than aerosol seem to be the dominant route of 
COVID-19 infection. They also felt that these results suggests 
that orofaecal transmission during colonoscopy is unlikely. 
These results are reassuring but more studies with robust 
design are needed to ascertain the exact risk of COVID-19 
transmission during GI endoscopy.
