The proof of principle that a drug targeting mTOR can improve survival has been obtained recently from a large randomised trial
using temsirolimus as a first-line therapy in patients with advanced poor prognostic renal cell carcinoma. Consistent data have recently
shown the important role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway in the regulation of crucial metabolic and mitotic functions of
cancer cells and endothelial cells allowing a better understanding of the role of mTOR in controlling cancer cell proliferation and
survival as well as tumour angiogenesis. As a result, rapamycin derivatives (rapalogues) that block mTOR/Raptor complex 1 were
shown to exert direct antiproliferative effects against endometrial cancers, in which cancer cells frequently lose PTEN function as well
as mantle cell lymphomas, in which cancer cell proliferation appears to be driven primarily by cyclin D1 overexpression. The overall
antitumour effects of rapalogues in renal cell carcinoma appear to be more complex with tumour growth inhibition resulting from
direct G1/S cell cycle blockage and/or apoptotic effects in carcinoma cells along with the inhibition of downstream signalling of the
HIF1a-induced VEGF/VEGFR autocrine loop in endothelial cells shutting down the maintenance of tumour angiogenesis. Despite
extensive cognitive researches, it is difficult to appraise which of those mechanisms is predominant in patients. This review focuses on
mechanisms of action of rapalogues focusing on antitumour effects in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

Temsirolimus is the first-in-class mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of patients
with advanced poor prognosis renal cell carcinoma (Hudes et al,
2007). Mechanisms by which inhibition of mTOR may control
tumour growth in patients with renal cancer remain unclear.
Laboratory experiments have shown that antiproliferative effects
of mTOR inhibitors in renal carcinoma cells may result from the
inhibition of essential survival pathways, complex cell cycle effects,
induction of apoptosis, and autophagy. Effects of mTOR inhibitors
may also be anticipated in several other cellular target populations
such as endothelial cells. The effect of mTOR inhibitors on
angiogenesis is likely to have an important function in renal
carcinoma, a highly vascularised tumour associated with a VHL￾driven angiogenesis. Despite elucidating most of the effects of
mTOR inhibitors in laboratory experiments, which of those
potential mechanisms of action account for the most overall
efficacy in patients, to what extent those effects are specific of renal
tumour cell biology, and which of the multiple cell signal changes
in cancer cells may serve as markers allowing better selection of
tumour for efficacy is poorly known. In addition, dosing and
schedules of mTOR inhibitors as well as drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetics may somehow affect their biological effects and
potential for combinability. In this brief review, we will attempt to
address some of those issues based on currently published data
with rapamycin derivatives (rapalogues).
BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO mTOR-RELATED CELL
SIGNALLING
mTOR is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that forms
multimolecular complexes and has a key function in apoptosis, cell
growth, and tumour proliferation by controlling cellular catabo￾lism and anabolism (extensively reviewed by Faivre et al, 2006a).
mTOR may complex with raptor (regulatory-associated protein of
mTOR) to form mTORC1, and can also complex with rictor
(rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) to form another
multimolecular complex named mTORC2 (Figure 1). mTORC1
may eventually be activated by growth factors including the
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), the platelet￾derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), and the insulin growth factor receptor
(IGFR), and nutrients through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway (Figure 2). In the presence of nutrients, growth
factors activate PI3K through the activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases. Once activated, mTORC1 acts through its downstream
effectors to stimulate protein synthesis and entrance into the G1
phase of the cell cycle through the eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP1); the 40S ribosomal protein, p70

S6 kinase (S6K1); p27; cyclin D1; and proteins that regulate
apoptosis including BAD, Bcl2, and p53. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signalling pathway is under the control of PTEN, but it may also be
inactivated by a feedback loop in which S6K1 directly inhibits
IRS1. Mechanisms that trigger the activation of mTORC2 and the
respective functions of mTORC1 vs mTORC2 in cancer cells
remain unclear. Mammalian target of rapamycin C2 may also act
upstream of mTORC1 by inducing the phosphorylation of AKT on
serine 473, a mechanism that is thought to participate in cell
survival and may account in resistance to rapalogues.
SIMILARITY AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
RAPALOGUES
Rapamycin (also named sirolimus, Wyeth) and other rapalogues
including temsirolimus (CCI-779, Wyeth), everolimus (RAD001,
Novartis Pharmaceutical), and deforolimus (AP23573, Ariad
Pharmaceutical) are macrocyclic lactones acting as anticancer
agents that target mTOR in several human cancers in vitro and
in vivo. The main differences between rapalogues lie in changes in
chemical properties in terms of drug solubility and metabolism. As
a result, temsirolimus and deforolimus are water soluble and may
be administered intravenously, whereas rapamycin and everolimus
display low solubility, and therefore are available only for oral
formulations. Rapalogues bind very similarly to the intracellular
immunophilin-, FK506, binding protein-12 (FKBP12) and selec￾tively inhibit mTORC1, but have no direct effects on mTORC2.
Potency to inhibit mTORC1 seems to be identical across
rapalogues. The inhibitory effects of rapalogues on mTORC1 do
not seem to affect the kinase activity of mTOR. Although limited
experiments have been carried out to benchmark and address
cross-resistance between rapalogues, similarities in terms of
chemical structures, mechanisms of action, affinity for the target,
and overall spectrum of activity in laboratory experiments strongly
suggest that currently developed rapalogues are similar in many
ways, the main differences belonging to pharmacokinetic proper￾ties rather than to antitumor potency.
Inhibition of mTORC1 activity by rapalogues is reversible only
slowly (about 5 days). Sensitivity and resistance to rapalogues may
depend on the duration of drug exposure. Short exposure to
rapalogues may result in the inhibition of mTORC1 that blocks the
downstream S6K1 resulting in the inhibition of the S6K1 feedback
loop, which in turn may help activate T308-AKT. For this reason,
although mTORC1 is inhibited, mTORC2 may still remain efficient
to activate S473-AKT and maintain cancer cell survival. Interest￾ingly, sustained exposure to rapamycin was shown to secondarily
inhibit mTORC2, as most of the mTOR bounded to rapamycin/
FKBP12 is unavailable to complex with rictor. Those data may
suggest that resistance to rapamycin may be associated with the
activation of AKT, a mechanism that may be at least in part
prevented using sustained exposure to rapamycin to block both
mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thereby, antitumour activity may depend
not only on the type of rapalogues and doses used in the clinic, but
also on the duration of drug administration/exposure. Sustained
exposure may increase the potency of rapalogues by inhibiting
mTORC1 as well as mTORC2. Considering the half-life of
rapalogues (see below), maximal mTOR inhibition may be
achieved using continuous daily oral dosing of everolimus,
whereas temsirolimus that is slowly biotransformed into sirolimus
can be given intravenously only once a week.

Temsirolimus was the first mTORC1 inhibitor investigated in
clinical trials in the late 1990s in patients with cancer.
Temsirolimus given intravenously on a weekly schedule showed
a safe toxicity profile, the most prevalent toxicities being reversible
skin toxicity, stomatitis, and thrombocytopenia. Pharmacokinetic
analysis showed that temsirolimus was converted into sirolimus,
and exposure to sirolimus was prevalent in plasma several days
after a single infusion of temsirolimus (Raymond et al, 2004;
Hidalgo et al, 2006). The respective roles of sirolimus and CCI-779
in antitumor effects of temsirolimus are yet to be proved.
Everolimus has subsequently been tested orally either on weekly
or daily schedules. Everolimus was also well tolerated, skin toxicity
being the most prevalent side effect. Similar results were obtained
with deforolimus. For those agents, dose-limiting toxicity was not
reached, and doses recommended for phase II studies were based
on compromises between side effects, pharmacokinetic, and
pharmacodynamic data. In addition, considering the long
pharmacokinetic and biological half-lives of those agents, the
advantages of daily vs weekly schedules remain unclear. Although
those drugs were somehow different, daily doses associated with
the antitumour effects of rapalogues ranged between 10 –25 mg,
whereas weekly doses recommended for phase II studies were
X25 mg.
PHARMACOKINETIC LIMITATIONS OF RAPALOGUES
Data specifically investigating the oral absorption and biodispon￾ibility of oral rapalogues primarily derive from those of sirolimus.
Recent data have shown that absorption of oral rapalogues may be
limited and participate in interpatient variability (O’Donnell et al,
2008). Patient oral bioavailability may be dependent on the
expression of ATP-binding cassette membrane transporters in the
gut accounting for variability in plasma concentrations and
exposures using current dosing of everolimus. Temsirolimus as
well as other rapalogues are metabolised primarily in the liver by
the cytochrome CYP450 3A4/5. Pharmacokinetic studies showed
that everolimus and deforolimus do not require biotransformation
for activity and no major metabolite was reported. Conversely,
temsirolimus displays a complex metabolism as the parental drug
CCI-779 is rapidly cleared from the plasma and converted by
CYP3A4 into sirolimus that becomes the most prevalent species
after temsirolimus intravenous infusion, and sustains at relatively
high concentrations for several days (Raymond et al, 2004).
Bioconversions of CCI-779 into sirolimus appear to be less than
dose proportional, suggesting a saturation of the CYP3A4 capacity
at higher dosing (Raymond et al, 2004). In addition, exposure to
deferolimus appears to be less than dose proportional (Mita et al,
2008). As both CCI-779 and sirolimus display similar effects on
mTORC1, the respective roles of the parental drug and its main
metabolite sirolimus on the overall activity of temsirolimus in
renal cancer remain unknown. Pharmacokinetic data demon￾strated that exposure to rapalogues is strongly increased by the
concomitant administration of drugs that are substrates, activa￾tors, and inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as rifampicin, anticonvul￾sants, and immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine (Boni
et al, 2007; Kuhn et al, 2007).
DIFFERENTIAL REVIEW OF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
OF mTOR INHIBITION IN CANCER CELLS
Do rapalogues induce direct antiproliferative effects
through cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in renal
carcinoma cells?
Rapalogues may exert antitumour effects by inducing dose￾dependent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in cancer
cells. Direct antitumour effects of mTORC1 inhibitors may require
specific biological conditions including the activation of the PI3K/
AKT/mTORC1 signalling as well as functional apoptotic pathways,
and the circumstances that render cancer cells are highly
vulnerable to rapalogues (Faivre et al, 2006a). Whether these
mechanisms have a function in the clinical activity of rapalogues in
renal cell carcinomas remain unknown. Several clear cell
carcinoma cell lines express high AKT levels and reduced PTEN
expressions that render them potentially sensitive to mTOR
inhibition (Hara et al, 2005). Activity of mTORC1 inhibitors,
particularly temsirolimus, in renal cell cancer has raised the
possibility that responders share a common molecular phenotype
that renders these tumours dependent on mTOR for growth and/or
survival. In renal cell cancer, PTEN gene expression has been
shown to be downregulated in a large percentage of cases,
presumably by epigenetic silencing (Brenner et al, 2002; Velickovic
et al, 2002). In particular, lack of PTEN expression has been shown
to be an independent negative prognostic factor for disease￾specific survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(Kim et al, 2005). However, in culture, most of the renal cancer cell
lines remain poorly sensitive to rapalogues. In our experience,
concentrations that may be reached in clinical trials are associated
only with mild antiproliferative effects with accumulation of cells
in late G1 of the cell cycle (Raymond E, personal communication).
Concentrations leading to apoptosis and autophagy are observed
only at high concentrations barely compatible with pharmaco￾kinetic exposures that may be reached in the patients. To our
knowledge, tumour types highly vulnerable to rapalogues include
endometrial cancer (Kanamori et al, 2001; Uegaki et al, 2005;
Oza et al, 2006; Colombo et al, 2007; Milam et al, 2007) that
frequently displays PTEN loss of function and mantle cell
lymphoma (Grewe et al, 1999; Witzig et al, 2005; Ansell et al,
2006) that overexpress cyclin D1. The effects of rapalogues in
mantle cell carcinoma are consistent with preclinical studies
showing that mTORC1 inhibitors could downregulate cyclin D1
(Aguirre et al, 2004). In those two examples, the susceptibility of
vulnerable endometrial cancer and mantle cell lymphoma cells to
rapalogues was obviously not dose-dependent. Conversely, on the
basis of the current knowledge, it is unlikely that renal carcinoma
cells display a more similar vulnerability than endometrial cancer
and mantle cell lymphoma to temsirolimus or other rapalogues. In
preclinical models, renal carcinoma cells appeared to be poorly
susceptible to rapalogues, and most of the antiproliferative effects
were dose-dependent, occurring at concentrations that may have
been far beyond those achievable in the clinic. In patients with
renal cell carcinoma, several doses of temsirolimus have been
tested in clinical trials but toxicity leads to refrainment from using
the highest possible dosing. As a result, it is difficult to believe that
the currently recommended doses of temsirolimus (and resulting
plasma exposures) are high enough to yield direct effects in renal
carcinoma cells, that is, to induce potent cell cycle inhibition and/
or cell death induction (either by apoptosis or autophagy). If a
direct effect of rapalogues against renal cancer cells is unlikely,
temsirolimus may induce antitumour effects by targeting other
cells with activated mTOR signalling such as the cells participating
to tumour angiogenesis.
Do the effects of rapalogues in renal cancer rely on
antiangiogenic properties?
Renal cell carcinoma is acknowledged to be an abundantly
vascularised tumour, in which cancer cells are primarily resistant
to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Historically, treatment for
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma has been limited.
Standard chemotherapeutic agents have been ineffective and
cytokine-based treatment with interleukin 2 or interferon-a
benefited only p10 –20% of patients. Initially, the phase I studies
of rapalogues showed objective responses in several patients with
renal cell carcinomas (Raymond et al, 2004; Hidalgo et al, 2006).

On the basis of exciting results observed in phase I trials,
intravenous weekly temsirolimus was investigated in a large dose￾randomised (25, 75, or 250 mg) phase II study of patients with
advanced renal cell carcinoma refractory to cytokine-based
therapy who were classified into three groups according to
Motzer’s criteria (Atkins et al, 2004). Overall, 85% of patients
had received prior interleukin 2 and 45% interferon-a treatment.
As a single agent, temsirolimus displayed a relatively low objective
response rate of 7%, with 26% additional minor responses
(Table 1). Interestingly, 17% of patients had stable disease lasting
more than 6 months. Higher survival rate was observed in patients
with Motzer’s intermediate or poor prognosis criteria who
experienced a nearly twofold increase in survival (22.5 months
for the intermediate group and 8.2 months for the group with poor
prognosis) compared with historical controls treated with inter￾feron-a (13.8 and 4.9 months for the intermediate and poor
prognosis groups, respectively). Interestingly, neither toxicity nor
efficacy was significantly influenced by the temsirolimus dose
level. Furthermore, a temsirolimus dose of 25 mg weekly was
selected for future exploration. These promising results subse￾quently led to the initiation of a large multicentre randomised
phase III trial comparing interferon-a given either alone or with
temsirolimus, or a single agent weekly intravenous administration
of 25 mg temsirolimus as a first-line treatment in a total of 626
high-risk patients according to Motzer’s criteria with advanced or
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Hudes et al, 2007). The trial
showed that patients treated with temsirolimus had a statistically
significantly longer median survival than those receiving inter￾feron-a (10.9 vs 7.3 months, P ¼ 0.008). Interestingly, the
combination of temsirolimus with interferon-a did not improve
survival in those patients. This study was the first clinical trial
showing a survival benefit in using an inhibitor of mTOR in
patients with cancer. Promising results have also been reported
with everolimus in 41 patients with advanced renal cell carcinomas
who had received up to one prior therapy (Jac et al, 2007).
Everolimus was given at a daily dose of 10 mg orally without
interruption. The objective response rate was 32%.
A weekly intravenous dose of temsirolimus induces sustained
exposure to low plasma concentrations of sirolimus, whereas
10 mg daily dose of everolimus achieves low plasma concentration
of this drug. What makes renal tumours so sensitive to low dose/
low exposure of mTORC1 inhibitors if renal cancer cells are not so
intrinsically sensitive? Preclinical data, as well as the great efficacy
of antiangiogenic therapies targeting VEGFR and PDGFR such as
sorafenib and sunitinib in renal cell cancer (Faivre et al, 2006b,
2007; Escudier et al, 2007; Motzer et al, 2007b), suggested that
mTORC1 inhibitors may also have antiangiogenic properties in
renal cell cancer. Indeed, it has been shown that mTORC1
inhibitors can target tumour growth indirectly, by interacting
with the maintenance of endothelial cells and pericytes that are
required for tumour angiogenesis. Tumour angiogenesis relies on
an intricate interplay between tumour cells, endothelial cells, and
surrounding mesenchymal cells (pericytes in microvessels and
vascular smooth-muscle cells in large vessels) to activate
endothelial cell proliferation, to recruit migrating endothelial cells
and pericytes, and to form new vessels through vascular
remodelling and maturation (Hamada et al, 2005). At the
molecular level, tumour angiogenesis depends on vascular growth
factors such as VEGF, PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), and members of the tumour growth factor-b (TGFb)
superfamily. Interestingly, all the above factors have been shown to
be able to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in cancer cells,
endothelial cells, or pericytes (Guba et al, 2002). Cellular
proliferation, survival, and migration required for vascular
sprouting, as well as endothelial cell differentiation, lead to tubule
formation that is driven primarily by VEGF/VEGFR activation,
which can in turn trigger the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Figure 3).
One of the major stimuli of cancer angiogenesis is hypoxia, which
activates hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which in
turn induce the expression of VEGF, VEGFR, bFGF, and PDGF.
Mammalian target of rapamycin can facilitate the translation of
HIF1a mRNA, thereby enhancing the vascular growth factor
expression (Arsham et al, 2002). In normal vessels, HIF1a is
transiently expressed as a result of the action of the HIF-prolyl
hydroxylase that targets HIF1a to a ubiquitin ligase complex
containing von-Hippel – Lindau (VHL), which marks it for
destruction by the proteasome. In renal cancer, loss-of-function
mutations of VHL can cause HIF1a stabilisation, thereby inducing
VEGF and PDGF overexpression and sustained tumour angio￾genesis (Le Tourneau et al, 2007). Inhibition of mTORC1 by
temsirolimus has been shown to reduce expression of HIF1a and
HIF2a under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in mouse
xenograft models (Thomas et al, 2006). In addition, recent work
has shown that temsirolimus preferentially inhibits VHL-null renal
cell carcinomas (Thomas et al, 2006). On the basis of pharmaco￾kinetic data, those effects may be expected in the clinic at doses of
rapalogues above 20 –25 mg per week. The observed clinical
efficacy of mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with renal cell
carcinoma may be mediated in part by dependence of efficient
HIF translation on the mTOR pathway by intercepting the VEGF/
VEGFR and/or PDGF/PDGFR signalling cascades. Overall, those
data strongly suggest that the anticancer effects of mTORC1

themselves.
USEFULNESS OF SURROGATE MARKERS AND
IMAGING TO MONITOR THE EFFECTS OF
RAPALOGUES
Monitoring the biological activity of rapalogues to determine the
biologically active dose rapidly appears as a challenge in patients
participating in clinical trials. As rapalogues interfere with glucose
metabolism using mechanism independent of their antitumour
effects, 18-FDG PET scan appears inappropriate to reliably
monitor the effects of rapalogues (O’Donnell et al, 2008).
Surprisingly, the effects of rapalogues on the levels of cholesterol
and triglyceride were never fully considered to monitor the
biological effects of rapalogues in trials in patients with cancer. As
easily available cells were peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs), most studies were carried out looking at the phosphory￾lation of S6K and 4EBP1 in those cells (Hidalgo et al, 2006; Mita
et al, 2008; O’Donnell et al, 2008; Tanaka et al, 2008). Those data
consistently showed a dose-dependent effect of rapalogues in
inducing a dephosphorylation of S6K and/or 4EBP1 in PBMC. In a
recent study, we showed that modelling the S6K dephosphory￾lation in PBMC in animals and humans under exposure to
everolimus allows prediction of a threshold level of activity of this
drug in humans and helps select dosing for phase II studies
(Tanaka et al, 2008). Similarly, another study addressed the direct
effects of everolimus on phosphorylation of several kinases
including S6K and AKT in skin and tumour tissue biopsies
(Tabernero et al, 2008). The authors showed that exposure to
continuous everolimus more readily induced inhibition of S6K
phosporylation and activation of S473-AKT at doses above 10 mg
per day and 50 mg per week. Unfortunately, because of the limited
number of patients entered in those studies, no correlation was
made between molecular changes, toxicity, and activity of
everolimus. Thus, it is unclear whether these molecular markers
are reliable for addressing the efficacy of rapalogues in tumour or
whether they may reflect only the molecular changes on drug
translation induced by rapalogues. Furthermore, none of the
currently tested biomarkers reliably addressed the antiangiogenic
effects of rapalogues and, for instance, little is known of the effects
of rapalogues on VEGF and sVEGFR2 in plasma of patients treated
for renal cell carcinomas. As no clear correlation between
antiproliferative/antitumor effects and inhibition of phosphoryla￾tions of S6K and 4EBP1 has been demonstrated, dose recommen￾dations that are based on currently studied surrogate biomarkers
may be underestimated. In our opinion, dose recommendations
for current and new rapalogues shall still be made on the basis of
evaluation of toxicity.
THE LIMITATION OF RAPALOGUES IN
MONOTHERAPY AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
COMBINATION THERAPY
Although rapalogues have displayed activity in a number of
malignancies, the antitumour effects of rapalogues in monotherapy
appear to be limited, the primary and acquired resistances to
mTORC1 inhibition being observed in the vast majority of tumour
types. Thereby, combinations seeking to broaden the spectrum of
activity and overcome resistance to rapalogues have been
investigated. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway has an
important function in cancer cell survival in response to the insult
induced by cytotoxic agents. Key factors for primary resistance
may involve survival and apoptosis signalling pathways. First,
tumour cells may be able to maintain survival and proliferation by
using redundant cross-signalling pathways involving particularly
MAPK. Second, tumour cells may have non-functional apoptotic
pathways, especially when expressing Bcl2 (Aguirre et al, 2004).
When survival and apoptotic signalling pathways are involved in
resistance to rapamycin, one solution to overcome resistance may
be based on combinations with other anticancer agents, especially
potent apoptosis inducers.
Mammalian target of rapamycin C1 inhibitor combinations with
conventional chemotherapy were designed to enhance the
proapoptotic effects of rapalogues with cytotoxics and to broaden
the spectrum of activity in tumour types only marginally sensitive
to single-agent rapalogues. However, combinations of rapalogues

barely compatible with clinical applications (Faivre et al, 2006a).
Furthermore, this approach may be of little relevance in renal cell
carcinoma for which no cytotoxic agent showed any activity.
The other possibility is to combine mTORC1 inhibitors with
targeted agents to avoid resistance mechanisms related to survival
signalling pathways. The goal of this strategy is either to optimise
inhibition of a pathway involving PI3K/AKT/mTOR or to inhibit
multiple signalling pathways. Strategy may consist, for example, in
combining an mTORC1 inhibitor with a tyrosine kinase receptor
inhibitor. Recent preclinical studies combining rapamycin with
inhibitors of EGFR or KIT receptors have shown synergistic effects
(Johnson et al, 2007). A number of combinations are currently
investigated using rapalogues with targeted agents. For example,
the combination of EGFR inhibitors with rapalogues offer a strong
potential for further clinical investigations in tumour type
responding to EGFR inhibitors such as lung and head-and-neck
carcinomas (Bianco et al, 2008). Whether those combinations may
have a potential in renal cell carcinoma remains to be investigated.
Finally, another possibility may consist, for example, in
combining an mTORC1 inhibitor with drugs targeting angio￾genesis. The antiangiogenic properties of both interferon-a and
temsirolimus, along with their activity as a single agent in renal cell
carcinoma provided a strong rationale for investigating their
combinations in clinical trials. Phase I/II trials showed that the
combination of temsirolimus with interferon was feasible with
a safe toxicity profile (Motzer et al, 2007a). Surprisingly, survival
of the combination of temsirolimus with interferon-a was not
superior to temsirolimus given as a single agent (Hudes et al, 2007).
Other antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sorafenib, and
sunitinib recently showed potent efficacy in patients with renal
cell carcinoma. Combinations of temsirolimus with sorafenib and
sunitinib in clinical trials are anticipated to be associated with
possible pharmacokinetic interactions as those agents are expected
to be catabolized by the same cytochromes in the liver. Conversely,
recent unpublished data suggest that combining bevacizumab with
temsirolimus is feasible and may have clinical potential to enhance
survival of patients with advanced kidney cancer.
‘NON-RAPALOGUES’ mTOR KINASE INHIBITORS
In this study, we stressed that some tumour types with
abnormalities involving the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway or with
sustained antiangiogenic activity such as kidney cancers are highly
sensitive to mTORC1 inhibitors. Nevertheless, most tumour types
are only marginally sensitive to mTORC1 inhibitors either because
of redundant signal transduction pathways, lack of functional
apoptosis/autophagy, or expression of VEGF/VEGFR-independent
angiogenesis. Furthermore, although acute toxicity of rapalogues is
fairly acceptable, long-term exposure to several rapalogues is
associated with interstitial pneumonitis (Vahid and Marik, 2008)
that may require treatment discontinuation and jeopardise
efficacy. It is thus important to consider other drugs blocking
the mTOR signalling pathways by different mechanisms of action
with distinct toxicity and overcoming current mechanisms of
resistance to rapalogues.
One of the key factors that might be involved in primary
resistance to mTORC1 inhibitors is the target itself. The
rapamycin-insensitive complex mTORC2 may limit the efficacy
of rapalogues by activating AKT. AKT activation may stimulate
several survival pathways that stimulate proliferation and inhibit
apoptosis. In this case, it might be interesting to investigate the
new generation of mTOR inhibitors that are designed to block the
kinase of mTOR, thereby inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2.
Drugs (some developed by Astra-Zeneca and Celgene) that target
the mTOR kinase are expected to be non-cross resistant to
rapamycin and to broaden the spectrum of activity of current
rapalogues. Acute and long-term toxicity, and combinability may
also be different from that of rapalogues. Mammalian target of
rapamycin kinase inhibitors are currently in preclinical develop￾ment and may soon enter clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS
Rapalogues inhibiting mainly mTORC1 have shown pleiotropic
effects targeting both cell proliferation and survival, ultimately
leading to antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects. In renal cell
cancer, which appears as an example of a tumour sensitive to
temsirolimus, the inhibition of angiogenesis presumably repre￾sents one of the major mechanisms of antitumour effects. Future
studies should aim at identifying biological parameters that may
predict the antitumour activity of mTORC1 inhibitors, distin￾guishing which of the possible mechanisms, that is, cell cycle
blockage, apoptosis, and autophagic induction in cancer cells vs
antiangiogenic effects, are predominant. Inhibition of the kinase of
mTOR represents an interesting new approach to target signalling
of mTORC1 and mTORC2.
