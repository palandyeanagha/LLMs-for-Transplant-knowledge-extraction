Abstract
Background: Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) are one of the main targets of inflammatory insults during interstitial
nephritis and kidney transplant rejection. While Th1 cells are know to be essential in the pathogenesis of rejection, the role
of Th17 is still under debate. We hypothesize that TECs modulate the outcome of rejection process by production of distinct
chemokines and cytokines that determine the attraction of different T-cell subsets. Therefore, we studied differential effects
of activated human renal epithelial cells on T-cell migration.
Methods: Human primary TECs were stimulated by IFN-c and TNF-a in vitro. Chemokines and cytokines produced by
activated TECs were measured using Luminex or ELISA. Chemotaxis assay was performed using activated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells composed of CD4+
CXCR3+ and CD4+
CCR6+ T cells migrating towards stimulated and unstimulated TECs.
Results: While activated TECs secreted abundant amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, the T helper cell
differentiation cytokines IL-1b, IL-12p70, IL-23 or TGF-b1 were not produced. The production of Th1 chemokines CXCL9,
CXCL10 and CCL5 were significantly upregulated after TEC stimulation. In contrast, Th17 chemokine CCL20 could not be
detected. Finally, activated TECs attracted significantly higher numbers of CD4+
CXCR3+ T cells as compared to unstimulated
TECs. No migration of CD4+
CCR6+ T cells could be observed.
Conclusion: Activated primary renal tubular epithelial cells do not attract Th17 cells nor produce cytokines promoting Th17
cell differentiation in our experimental system mimicking the proinflammatory microenvironment of rejection.

Introduction
Tubular Epithelial Cells (TECs) comprise more than 75% of
renal parenchymal cells. Their susceptibility and resistance to both
inflammation and apoptosis directs the long-term function of
kidney transplants, as tubular injury can be a major cause of
nephron loss [1]. As such, tubulitis is the diagnostic hallmark of
acute cellular rejection and can potentially lead to irreversible
structural graft damage.
To date, important progress has been made in understanding
the pathogenesis of rejection. So far, mechanisms of rejection
entail a multi-cellular inflammatory process where local environ￾ment and multi-directional interplays between T cells and
parenchymal cells such as tubular epithelial cells will determine
the final outcome [2,3].
Classically, the proinflammatory Th1 cell is thought to
represent one of the dominant immune cell types involved in
induction and maintenance of acute cellular rejection [4,5]. On
the contrary, the role of Th17 cells in the rejection process is not
clear yet [6]. Th1 cells express IFN-c and the transcription factor
T-bet [7]. Th17 cells are defined by the expression of the cytokine
IL-17 and the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor c (RORc) [8].
Distinct cytokines drive the differentiation of naı¨ve CD4+ T cells
towards different T cell subsets. IL-12 and IFN-c are considered to
be the main T helper 1 associated cytokines and IL-1b, IL-6, IL-23
and TGF-b1 are T helper 17 associated counterparts [4].
At present, controversial data exist with regard to the
involvement and the role of Th17 cells during kidney transplant
rejection [6]. Despite some experimental murine data directly
linking Th17 cells to rejection, most studies in clinical transplan￾tation are limited to the detection of IL-17. IL-17 has been
detected by immunofluorescent staining in biopsies from acutely
rejecting transplants and not in pretransplant biopsy samples or
healthy kidneys [9]. Increased IL-17 mRNA and protein
expression levels in kidney biopsies and urine samples from
patients with subclinical rejection underline the involvement of IL￾17 in the process of rejection [10]. Yapici et al. reported that the
majority of IL-17 producing cells in kidney transplant biopsies
undergoing acute rejection are mast cells or neutrophils and not T￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64916

lymphocytes [11]. These data suggest that IL-17 may play a role
during the rejection process.
Th1 cells preferentially express the chemokine receptors CCR5
and CXCR3 migrating towards CCL5 and CXCL10 which are
expressed by TECs and present during kidney transplant rejection
[12–16]. Th17 cells are characterized by the simultaneous
expression of IL-17 and the chemokine receptor CCR6 directing
the most robust chemotaxis towards CCL20 [17,18]. In a
prospective biopsy-controlled study it was found that local CCL5
and CXCL10 produced by TECs led to the directional movement
of activated CXCR3 and CCR5 bearing T cells into the kidney
transplant mediating acute rejection [14]. Accordingly, CCL20
expression was shown by immunohistochemical staining of both
infiltrating leucocytes and tubular epithelial cells in kidney biopsies
obtained from patients experiencing rejection [19].
We hypothesize that TECs modulate the outcome of the
inflammatory process by the production of distinct chemokines
and cytokines that determine the attraction, activation and further
differentiation of T-cell subsets. In the present study, we
specifically aim to investigate whether TECs after stimulation by
IFN-c and TNF-a, which are instrumental inflammatory cytokines
during rejection, have the potential to attract Th1 and Th17 T-cell
subsets. Chemokine and cytokine production by IFN-c/TNF-a
activated primary human TECs as well as their functional
potential to attract CD4+ T cell subsets were studied.
Materials and Methods
Culture of primary tubular epithelial cells
Primary tubular epithelial cells were cultured from cortical
tissue of human kidneys obtained at the time of transplantation as
previously described [20,21]. TECs were cultured in serum-free
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham F12 (BioWhit￾taker, Verviers, Belgium) in a 1:1 ratio, supplemented with insulin
(5 mg/ml), transferrin (5 mg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml), hydrocorti￾sone (36 ng/ml), tri-iodothyronine (40 pg/ml) and epidermal
growth factor (10 ng/ml) (all from Sigma). Cell growth was
maintained in a T75 cell culture flask (Greiner Bio-One, Essen,
Germany). For passages of cell cultures, cells were washed twice
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized with 0.05%
trypsin-EDTA at 37uC and then washed in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium and Ham F12 in a 1:1 ratio supplemented with
10% heat inactivated FBS. Cells were used between passages 2
and 6 of culture. The specific outgrowth of TEC was confirmed by
morphologic appearance and immunofluorescence staining
(CD13+
, CD26+ and CD90-
) (data not shown).
TEC activation experiments
TECs were seeded in 24 well plates at a density of 26105 TEC/
ml in the above described medium. After one day medium was
replaced with TEC culture medium with or without addition of
cytokines. TECs were stimulated with 50 ng/ml human recom￾binant IFN-c (U-Cytech, Utrecht, the Netherlands) and/or 20 ng/
ml human recombinant TNF-a (PeproTech, London, UK) for
24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Supernatants were harvested and stored at
280uC until analysis.
Flow cytometry
TECs were harvested via trypsinization after 24, 48 and
72 hours. TECs washed with cold PBS supplemented with 0.5%
albumin (PBSA 0.5%) and stained for CD13 PE-Cy7, CD26
FITC, CD86 FITC, HLA-I APC, HLA-DR APC-Cy7 (all BD
Biosciences), CD40 PerCP-Cy5.5 (Biolegend), CD80 PE (Serotec),
CD90 APC (R&D systems) at 4uC for 30 minutes. Cells were
washed twice with cold PBSA 0.5% following flow cytometric
analysis. Fifty thousand events were acquired from each tube by a
FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Data was analyzed with FACS Diva 6.1 software (BD Bioscience).
Quantitative real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit
(Roche Applied Science, Almere, The Netherlands), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were mea￾sured by using the Nanadrop ND-8000 Spectrophotometer
(Isogen Life Science, De Meern, the Netherlands). First-strand
complementary DNA (cDNA) reaction was performed from
500 ng of the isolated RNA. A quantitative RT-PCR was used
to quantify the amount of MIP-3a in the samples. Assay-on￾demand products for the detection and quantification of MIP-3a
(hs00171125_m1) mRNAs were designed by Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA). A 5 mL sample of cDNA was added to 20 mL
PCR mixture containing 12.5 mL Universal PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), 0.625 mL of each specific primer and probe
assay-on-demand mix, and 6.875 mL of water. The RT-PCR
reaction was performed with the StepONEplus (Applied Biosys￾tems). The amount of each target molecule was quantified by
measuring the threshold cycles (Ct) on a TaqMan Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems) and was transformed to the number of
cDNA copies [2(40-Ct)]. The absolute value of the number of MIP￾3a mRNA copies was log transformed.
Cytokine analysis
Production of cytokines by unstimulated and 24 h, 48 h and
72 h IFN-c/TNF-a stimulated TECs were measured in superna￾tant using a Bio-Plex multiplex assay (Bio-Rad Laboraties,
Veenendaal, the Netherlands) for IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-17,
CXLC9 (MIG), CXLC10 (IP-10), CCL5 (RANTES), IL-8 and
CCL2 (MCP-1). Samples were analyzed using a Bio-Plex Array
Reader with Bio-Plex software. IL-23 (U-CyTech, Biosciences,
Netherlands), TGF-b1 (eBioscience, San Diego, USA) and CCL20
(MIP-3a) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were measured by
ELISA. All immunoassays were performed according manufac￾turers guidelines.
Chemotaxis assay
Migration assays were performed using 3 mm pore membrane
inserts (ThinCerts; Greiner Bio-One). For each experiment, TECs
were seeded in a 24 well plate at a density of 56103 cells (an
optimized cell density; data not shown). Stimulation was
performed with 50 ng/ml IFN-c and 20 ng/ml TNF-a for
24 hours. PBMCs were activated to induce expression of the
chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6. PBMCs were stimulat￾ed with soluble anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml), anti-CD28 (1 mg/ml) and
polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig (1 mg/ml) (BD Pharmingen), IFN-c
(50 ng/ml, U-Cytech) and IL-2 (200 IU/ml Chiron BV, Am￾sterdam, the Netherlands) for 3 days. Anti-CD3/CD28 activated
PBMCs were washed with medium without serum three times.
After 4 hours of incubation at 37uC, migrated CD4+ T cells were
analyzed for CXCR3 and CCR6 expression by flow cytometry
(BD FACS CantoII). Total cell numbers were determined by flow
cytometric analysis, performed with a fixed time point and a fixed
volume for standardization.

study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Statistics
Results are expressed as mean 6 SEM unless stated otherwise.
Cytokines and chemokines present in supernatant were analyzed
for statistical significance with GraphPad Prism 5.01 software
(Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) using non-parametric Fried￾man test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. Chemotaxis
experiments were analyzed with the non-parametric Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed-rank test. P values of less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
IFN-c and TNF-a stimulation upregulates expression of
CD40, HLA-I and HLA-DR by TECs
TECs were cultured with medium alone and in the presence of
IFN-c/TNF-a. After 24 hours of stimulation, CD40, HLA-I and
HLA-DR cell surface markers were upregulated by TECs and
remained highly present for at least 72 hours as shown by a
significantly higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) indicating
that TECs are activated in this experimental system (P,0.001)
(Figure 1A and Figure 1C). Additionally, we investigated the
expression of some other TEC related (activation) markers. In line
with earlier findings the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and
CD86 were not expressed by TECs irrespective of their
stimulation state (Figure 1B).
TECs fail to secrete Th1 and/or Th17 differentiation
cytokines after IFN-c and TNF-a stimulation while
producing abundant amounts of proinflammatory
cytokines IL6 and IL8
To define whether TECs are capable of production of cytokines
by which naı¨ve CD4+ T cells may differentiate into Th1 and/or
Th17 cells or change the cytokine profile of Th1 and Th17 cells,
we stimulated TECs (N = 10) with IFN-c/TNF-a and analyzed
the cytokine profile of supernatants harvested under these
stimulatory conditions compared to the unstimulated state.
Unstimulated and IFN-c/TNF-a activated TECs did not secrete
IL-12p70. Th17 associated cytokines including IL-1b, IL-17, IL￾23 and TGF-b1 were not produced either by unstimulated TECs
or after IFN-c/TNF-a stimulation (Table 1). In contrast, IL-6 and
IL8 were produced in high concentrations by TECs after IFN-c/
TNF-a stimulation compared to unstimulated TECs (5 fold
increase, Figure 2).
Th1 associated chemokines are produced after IFN-c and
TNF-a stimulation
We investigated the production of Th1 associated chemokines
CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL5 (RANTES) and CCL2
(MCP-1) under non stimulatory and IFN-c/TNF-a stimulatory
conditions in a time dependent manner for 24, 48 and 72 hours.
Figure 1. IFN-c and TNF-a stimulation upregulates expression of activation markers CD40, HLA-I and HLA-DR by TECs. Primary TECs

HLA-I and HLA-DR. One representative out of 10 experiments is shown. The upregulation of activation markers was observed after 24 h stimulation

Combined stimulation with IFN-c and TNF-a resulted in a
synergistic induction of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL5. Compared
to unstimulated condition CXCL10 showed a 65 fold increase
after 24 hours stimulation (30 pg/ml vs 1960 pg/ml; P,0.001).
After 72 hours a 2.5 fold increased production of CXL10 was
found compared to 24 hours (5064 pg/ml) (Figure 3). CCL5 was
already significantly upregulated after 48 hours (47 pg/ml) and
remained high after 72 hours (66 pg/ml) as compared to
unstimulated condition, while CXCL9 could only be detected
after 72 hours stimulation (114 pg/ml). CCL2 production by
TECs was present constantly at all time points measured showing
a rapid onset and reaching a high plateau level after 24 hours
which was retained during 72 hours. In unstimulated condition
and at 24 hours, TECs produced CCL2 at a concentration of
1018 pg/ml. IFN-c alone failed to upregulate CCL2 production,
while both TNF-a (2154 pg/ml) and IFN-c/TNF-a (2550 pg/ml)
stimulation significantly upregulated CCL2 production (Figure 3).
CCL20 is not produced by TECs after IFN-c and TNF-a
stimulation
We investigated whether tubular epithelial cells have the
potential to produce CCL20 (MIP-3a) in our system. TECs did
not upregulate CCL20 mRNA levels after IFN-c and TNF-a
stimulation. Accordingly, TECs were also not able to produce the
Th17 associated chemokine CCL20 (Figure 4); neither unstimu￾lated nor after 24, 48 and 72 hours of stimulation with IFN-c and
TNF-a.
Th1 and not Th17 cells are attracted by IFN-c and TNF-a
stimulated TECs
Anti-CD3/CD28 activated PBMCs were added to the upper
chamber of 3 mm pore membrane inserts. Unstimulated or IFN-c/
TNF-a stimulated TECs were tested for their capacity to attract
CD4+
CXCR3+ or CD4+
CCR6+ T cells, representing respectively
Th1 and Th17 containing cell pools (Figure 5A). After 4 hours of
incubation, cells in the lower chamber were harvested and
CXCR3 and CCR6 expression on CD4+ T cells were determined.
CD7 positive and CD16/CD56 negative lymphocytes were
discriminated as anti-CD3/CD28 activated T lymphocytes (Figure
5B). The total numbers of migrated CD4+ T cells (Figure 5C) were
measured as readout. Although unstimulated TECs were able to
attract CD4+
CXCR3+ T cells to a low extent, IFN-c/TNF-a
activated TECs induced a significant migration of CD4+
CXCR3+
T cells (P,0.05). No CD4+
CCR6+ T cells were attracted by
unstimulated TECs. In line with our chemokine data, IFN-c/
TNF-a activated TECs failed to induce migration of CD4+
CCR6+
T cells. As such, activated primary renal tubular epithelial cells
attract CD4+
CXCR3+ T cells, but not CD4+
CCR6+ T cells
(Figure 5D and Figure 5E).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the differential effects of activated
human renal epithelial cells on T cell migration. We questioned
whether TECs after stimulation by IFN-c and TNF-a representing
instrumental proinflammatory cytokines during rejection, have the
potential to attract Th1 and Th17 T-cell subsets. Our data
demonstrate that IFN-c/TNF-a activated renal tubular epithelial
cells primarily produce Th1-associated chemokines and not the
Th17-associated chemokine CCL20. Functionally, only
CD4+
CXCR3+ T cells and hardly any CD4+
CCR6+ T cells were
attracted by activated TECs, when PBMC migration towards
activated and resting TECs was tested using chemotaxis assays.
Moreover, activated TECs do not produce cytokines promoting
Th17 cell differentiation in our experimental system.
The recruitment of T cells from the peripheral circulation into
the allograft is an essential event in acute kidney transplant
rejection. Essential elements involved in this process are

chemokines secreted in the tissue and the corresponding
chemokine receptors present on T cells [14]. On the one side,
transplantation procedure itself may have a direct effect on the
chemokine profile within the graft. Following organ harvest, the
intervening period of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion results
in the release of various pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-1,
TNF-a and IL-8 [22]. On the other side, rejection process can
lead to release of chemokines which are mainly produced by
inflamed parenchymal cells like tubular epithelial cells indicating a
crucial role in the attraction of immune cells. It has been

demonstrated that in kidney transplant biopsies from patients with
acute rejection, expression of CCL2 and CCL5 is mainly found in
TECs with mononuclear cell infiltration [23]. The production of
chemokines like CCL2, CCL5 and IL-8 in vitro by TECs depends
on cytokine activation. Various proinflammatory cytokines and
CD40L stimulation resulted in a strong production of these
chemokines by TECs [24,25]. Also IL-4 and IL-13 have a dose￾dependent effect on CD40-induced CCL5 production by TECs
[26]. Activation of TECs in vitro is assumed to mimic in vivo
processes. In our in vitro experiments we stimulated the TECs with
IFN-c and TNF-a. This choice was made upon many in vivo and in
vitro observations designating both IFN-c and TNF-a as key
regulator cytokines during kidney transplant rejection. A high
TNF-a producer phenotype correlated with recurrent acute
rejection episodes clinically [27] and also IFN-c gene transcription
is associated with high grade scores of tubulitis and the occurrence
of rejection [28,29]. Not surprisingly, these proinflammatory
cytokines are both upregulated during renal allograft rejection
[30].
While Th1 differentiated cells preferentially express CXCR3
and CCR5, Th17 cells preferentially express the chemokine
receptor CCR6 [12,17]. Increased expression of CXCR3 tran￾script levels were found in both subclinical and clinical acute
kidney transplant rejection [31]. It is even suggested that CXCR3
is the most important chemokine receptor for the development of
rejection, as CXCR3-/- mice showed an prolonged graft survival
compared to wild type mice [29]. Although CXCR3 has been
suggested to act as a potent chemokine receptor present during
renal allograft rejection, the role of CCR6+ T cells still needs to be
elucidated. As we were interested in the attraction of Th1 and
Th17 cells by TECs, we determined the total number of migrated
CD4+
CXCR3+ and CD4+
CCR6+ T cells in our migration assay
experiments. TECs were observed to have the potential to attract
CD4+
CXCR3+ T cells. Activation of TECs with IFN-c and TNF￾a increased the migration of CD4+
CXCR3+ T cells, while no
migration of CD4+
CCR6+ T cells could be detected. Our data
confirm that activated TECs are capable of attracting Th1 cells
while this is not the case for Th17 cells, assuming that the majority
of Th1 cells are CXCR3+ T cells and the majority of Th17 cells
express CCR6 receptor.
CCR6 expression is of critical importance for Th17 migration
and has been associated with aggravated experimental glomeru￾lonephritis, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), inflammatory bowel
disease and rheumatoid arthritis [32]. So far, Woltman et al
published the only report on CCL20 expression and CCR6+ cells
in kidney transplant rejection [19]. The authors reported CCL20
and CCR6+ infiltrating cells in kidney graft biopsies during
rejection and found that the attraction of immature dendritic cells
by TECs depends on CCL20. In our study, the Th17 associated
chemokine CCL20 was not produced by TECs after IFN-c and
TNF-a stimulation, while Woltman et al. found an increased
CCL20 production after IL-1a and CD40L stimulation [19]. They
also reported that after IFN-c stimulation, a clear inhibitory effect
on the IL-1a and CD40L-induced CCL20 production was found.
Apparently, CCL20 produced by TECs depends on the type of
stimulation.
Chemokines present in the allograft determine the attraction of
specific T cell subsets recruited towards this allograft. CXCL9,
CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL5 attract Th1 cells [14], while CCL20
attract Th17 cells [17]. We found a strong synergy between the
cytokines IFN-c and TNF-a on chemokine production by TECs.
IFN-c or TNF-a alone was not able to significantly increase
CXCL9, CXCL10 or CCL5 at any time point tested, while a
combination of IFN-c and TNF-a increased the chemokine
production by TECs profoundly. Synergistic effects of combined
stimuli on TEC activation and cytokine/chemokine production
have been observed before [24]. In our system, the production of
CCL2 was strongly increased when IFN-c and TNF-a were
combined. IFN-c alone was not able to upregulate CCL2
production while TNF-a could. During kidney transplant rejection
intrarenal RNA expression of Th1-associated ligands CXCL10
and CCL5 have been documented [14], also increased urinary
chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 were found during acute
rejection compared to stable recipients [33]. In line, we found
Th1-associated chemokines, while we were not able to document
the production of the Th17-associated chemokine CCL20 by
activated TECs. This indicates that the controversy in literature on
CCL20 contribution to rejection probably depends on the
dominant cytokines present in the microenvironment.
Local immunoregulation driven by cytokines during kidney
graft rejection has been suggested by animal and clinical
transplantation studies using graft biopsies and confirmed by in
vitro studies using TEC cell lines. A variety of proinflammatory
cytokines were shown to be produced during rejection like IL-6,
TNF-a, IL-15 and IL-18 on both gene transcript and protein level
[23]. In our study, proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1b, IL￾12p70 and IL-23 were not produced by TECs in contrast to
abundantly high IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations. Also active TGF￾b1 could not be produced by both resting and activated TECs. As
IL-12 is critical for the Th1 response [34] and IL-1b, IL-6, IL-23
and TGF-b1 are critical cytokines for Th17 cell differentiation and
development [35], it can be argued whether under our experi￾mental conditions, TEC associated cytokine profile might facilitate
the Th1 and Th17 differentiation of naı¨ve CD4+ T cells.
Dissection of the individual contributions of the CD4+ T-cell
subsets in transplant rejection is still a challenge for transplant
immunologists because of redundancy and plasticity of the
different effector pathways of CD4+ T cells [36]. Under the
influence of IL-12, Th17 cells can switch their phenotype to
become Th1 cells, as Th17 express both IL-12 and IL-23
receptors. In contrast, Th1 cells cannot undergo this phenotype
switching [37]. The plasticity of the CD4+ T-cell subsets on the
one hand and the variety of locally produced inflammatory
mediators like cytokines and chemokines in vivo on the other hand,
challenge the balanced regulation between rejection and accep￾tance of the kidney graft in due time and make it susceptible for
any inflammatory insult which can influence the determinants of
this redundant process. We could not find any evidence for a
stereotyped cytokine profile by TECs in our system that could
direct any phenotype switching and reprogramming of CD4+ T
cells with regard to Th1- and Th17-associated pathways.
In summary, recruitment and infiltration of a kidney transplant
by T cells, is one of the initial steps towards induction of structural
(P,0.05). No migration of CD4+CCR6, containing Th17 cell pool, could be detected. CD7+ and CD16-
/CD56- lymphocytes were discriminated as anti￾CD3/CD28 activated T lymphocytes. (C and D) Transwell migration results of 9 individual experiments using unstimulated TECs vs. stimulated TECs are
shown. The total cell number of migrated CD4+
CXCR3+ and CD4+
CCR6+ T cells are depicted on the Y –axis. Results were obtained by flow cytometry
using fixed time point and fixed volume. * Significant increase (P ,0.05).

graft damage. Our observations show that activated primary renal
tubular epithelial cells do not attract Th17 cells nor produce
cytokines promoting Th17 cell differentiation.
