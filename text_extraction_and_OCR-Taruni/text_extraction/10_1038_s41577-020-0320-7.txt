Most patients who become critically ill following 
infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of 
COVID-19, develop acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS)1
. The deterioration of lung function has been 
attributed to a maladaptive immune response rather than 
increased viral loads. One theory is that the activation of 
lung-resident immune cells via pattern-recognition 
receptors drives the release of pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines and extravasation of blood neutrophils and 
monocytes into the bronchi. These cells may disrupt 
the air–blood barrier by causing collateral tissue dam￾age, particularly to airway epithelial cells and vascular 
endothelial cells, which express the ACE2 entry recep￾tor for SARS-CoV-2; the damage of vascular endothelial 
cells may account for thrombotic microangiopathies. 
Currently, COVID-19 management is limited to symp￾tomatic and palliative treatment. Efforts are underway 
to develop more effective therapies, with trials including 
various antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory agents and 
the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. Ongoing 
clinical trials of IL-6 and IL-1 blockade in patients had 
promising preliminary results and may build a basis for 
combinatorial immunotherapy approaches.
Complement is an integral component of the innate 
immune response to viruses and an instigator of pro￾inflammatory responses2,3
. A recent study of SARS-CoV, 
which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, found that 
activation of complement component C3 exacerbates 
disease in SARS-CoV-associated ARDS4
. C3-deficient 
mice infected with SARS-CoV exhibited less respiratory 
dysfunction, despite equivalent viral loads in the lungs, 
and this was associated with decreased lung infiltration 
of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes and lower 
levels of cytokines and chemokines in both the lungs and 
sera4
. This suggests that C3 inhibition may also alleviate 
the inflammatory lung complications of SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The prominent decrease in lung-infiltrating 
neutrophils and the reduced levels of both intrapul￾monary and plasma IL-6 seen in SARS-CoV-infected 
C3-deficient mice suggests the potential of combining 
C3 inhibitors with anti-IL-6 regimens. Furthermore, 
the upstream positioning of C3 signalling in the innate 
immune cascade further argues for the broader anti￾inflammatory potential of C3 blockade with agents such 
as AMY-101 (REF.3
), which is currently being tested in 
patients with COVID-19. C3 inhibition could simul￾taneously block C3a and C5a generation, as well as 
intrapulmonary C3 activation and IL-6 release from 
alveolar macrophages, or other cells that express C3a 
receptors (C3aRs) and/or C5a receptors (C5aRs), thereby 
ameliorating lung injury. Ex vivo whole blood infection 
models with the compstatin C3 inhibitor AMY-101 
have shown that this interferes with IL-6 release3
.
An important caveat is that, although complement 
activation has been associated with the pathophysiol￾ogy of ARDS caused by various underlying diseases5
, 
clinical data on the role of complement activation in 
the development of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS are 
scarce. A recent preprint study reported that lung biopsy 
samples from patients with severe COVID-19 showed 
widespread complement activation, characterized by 
C3a generation and C3-fragment deposition6
. A prom￾inent increase of serum C5a levels was also observed. 
Importantly, treatment of patients with an anti-C5a 
antibody led to immediate clinical improvement, as 
measured by increased lung oxygenation and decreased 
systemic inflammation6
. C5 inhibitors have been safely 
used in the clinic for almost 15 years, and their use in ini￾tial clinical trials is supported by the well-established role 
of the C5a–C5aR axis in the pathophysiology of ARDS. 
However, C5 inhibition by these agents can be partial, 
allowing residual terminal pathway activity to skew effi￾cacy in cases of excessive complement activation, which 
is often seen in infections. Also, these drugs will not 
affect the C3a–C3aR axis. Proximal complement inhib￾itors (which target C3 or its upstream activators) could 
be more effective, but these are still in clinical develop￾ment, and none has yet been approved, although limited 
data from phase II clinical trials are available. Given the 
organization of the complement system, all these agents 
could potentially prevent the initial steps leading to overt 
lung inflammation (Fig. 1). A broader inhibitory effect on 
the maladaptive inflammatory response may be achieved 
with anti-C3 agents (such as AMY-101), and some 
pathway-specific upstream inhibitors may also show 
efficacy (for example, lectin pathway inhibitors). The 
benefits of specifically inhibiting either the alternative 
pathway or classical pathway remain to be clarified.

Additional questions remain concerning the ther￾apeutic use of complement inhibitors for COVID-19. 
Only a small proportion of patients develop aggressive 
disease but reliable clinical indicators to identify these 
patients early in disease progression are lacking. The 
time window for optimal intervention and the patient 
populations that could benefit from therapeutic comple￾ment inhibition have yet to be established. Biomarkers of 
complement activity are not routinely used, as most 
of them are unstable and have a very short half-life. 
However, the combination of clinical indicators of ARDS 
progression with known biomarkers of inflammation 
(C-reactive protein, plasma IL-6 levels and ferritin) 
would allow identification of patients that could benefit 
from complement inhibition. In these advanced stages 
of COVID-19, C3 inhibition has the potential to broadly 
control not only ARDS but also the systemic inflamma￾tion affecting the microvascular beds of the kidney, brain 
and other vital organs, which seems to be a complication 
in severe cases.
Complement is a key player of protective immunity 
against pathogens, but its excessive or deregulated activa￾tion may result in collateral tissue injury. However, com￾plement inhibitors are currently only used in rare human 
diseases, such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobin￾uria. In these unprecedented times, we would encourage 
all complement-dedicated pharmaceutical companies, 
as well as individual scientists, to actively contribute 
to our efforts to understand the role of complement 
in COVID-19.
