Small intestinal length: a factor essential for gut
adaptation
L T Weaver, S Austin, T J Cole
Abstract
Changes in small intestinal structure, cyto￾kinetics, and function are dynamic ways in
which the gut adapts to diet, disease, and
damage. Adequate length provides a static
'reserve' permitting an immediate response to
pathophysiological changes. The length of the
small intestine from conception to adulthood
using data taken from eight published reports
of necropsy measurement of 1010 guts is
described. Mean length at 20 weeks' gestation
was 125 cm, at 30 weeks' 200 cm, at term 275
cm, at 1 year 380 cm, at 5 years 450 cm, at 10
years 500 cm, and at 20 years 575 cm. Prenatal
small intestinal growth exceeded that of body
length according to the law: small intestinal
length a body length to the power 4/3. After
birth there was a noticeable deceleration:
small intestinal length a body length to the
power 1/2. The coefficient of variation of small
intestinal length postnatally was 24%, sixfold
greater than for body length. The rapid pre￾natal small intestinal growth rate ensures that
the mature newborn has adequate small intes￾tine to meet postnatal nutritional demands, but
handicaps the preterm infant who undergoes
intestinal resection. The wide variation in
lengths suggests a 'surplus' surface area that is
immediately available to respond, independent
of dynamic mucosal changes, to fluctuations
in food availability, local intestinal disease,
damage, rapid transit, and resection.
and (2) the wide variation in the small intestinal
lengths of healthy adults.
Subjects and methods
Reported measurements of small intestinal
length were obtained from eight published
reports.3"10 All data were derived from unfixed
necropsy specimens that were usually measured
(when methods were described) along the
unstretched antimesenteric border from the
pylorus or ligament of Treitz to the ileocaecal
valve. Subjects with congenital gastrointestinal
and cardiac disease have been excluded from the
analysis. No distinction has been made between
the sexes.
The lengths of 1010 specimens were plotted
against the lengths or heights of the subjects. All
length measurements were converted to cm. To
establish the relation between intestinal length
and body length or height, the data were fitted by
cubic spline regression." To deal with the mix￾ture of individual and grouped data in the
sample, each point in the analysis was given a
weighting corresponding to the number of indi￾viduals contained in it: 1 for individuals and n for
groups of size n. The spline curve was fitted to
both the original data and to the log transformed
data. In the latter case, the slope of the regression
curve indicated the power relation between small
intestinal length and body length.

The small intestine is the major site of nutrient
and water absorption. To ensure an adequate
surface area to meet the nutritional requirements
of the organism, it is a long coiled organ whose
epithelial surface is increased many times by
circular folds, villi, and microvilli. '
For most mammals there is a direct relation
between the gross surface area of the small
intestine and body size. This is related to the diet
eaten by each species, and for man it conforms
with that of other members of the superfamily
Hominoidea.2
The changing rates of small intestinal growth
during embryological, prenatal, and postnatal
life, and the considerable 'surplus' length of the
mature gut have important implications for our
understanding and expectations of alimentary
function after intestinal resection (particularly in
the preterm infant) and during disease, altered
food availability, and other pathophysiological
conditions.
The purpose of this review is to summarise the
published data on the growth of the small
intestine of man and to draw attention to two
significant findings: (1) the doubling of its length
prenatally during the last trimester of pregnancy
Results
During the first half of pregnancy (to 32 cm fetal
length) there was a linear increase in small
intestinal length. Thereafter there was an
accelerated rate of growth, with a doubling of
small intestinal length during the last 15 weeks
of gestation leading to a mean length at birth of
275 cm (Fig 1).
Growth in intestinal length continued during
early postnatal life, but from about 1 year (75 cm
body length) onwards it slowed and remained
linear with increasing age to adulthood. From
birth there was a wide range in intestinal lengths
reported, with 100% variation from early child￾hood onwards. The coefficient of variation of
small intestinal length postnatally was 24%,
sixfold greater than for body length.
Figure 2 shows the corresponding results and
spline curve obtained after log transformation of
the data. The pre- and perinatal acceleration in
length is clearly seen. In proportional terms,
prenatal growth in small intestinal length was
consistently faster than that of body length,
increasing as the power law small intestinal
length a body length to the power 4/3. After birth
there was a noticeable deceleration in small
intestinal length growth, so that it was less than

intestinal growth is prenatal, ensuring that the
term infant is born with adequate absorptive
surface area to support its postnatal nutritional
needs. Gastrointestinal development and cellular
X differentiation occur largely in utero during the
Kt first half of pregnancy. During this time there is
<"" linear growth of the small intestine, which
achieves its final anatomic position in the
< abdomen, after extracoelomic extension and
rotation, by the 20th week of gestation.' There￾after there is accelerated growth in length to
term. After birth small intestinal growth con￾tinues at a slower rate until adulthood.
To establish the relation between intestinal
length and body length or height, the cubic
spline regression was fitted to the data. " This is a
form of regression which fits a smooth curve to
the data without dictating its shape, unlike, for
example, polynomial regression. In this way the
underlying shape of the relation is emphasised,
highlighting in particular the pre- and postnatal
growth rates.
The perinatal period is of critical importance
to the growing organism, during its adaptation

Throughout life adaptation seems to be regu￾lated largely by luminal nutrition. Exposure of
the neonatal small intestine to enteral feeds is
B) is followed by changes in mucosal structure and
170 cm. function: an acceleration of epithelial cell turn￾ne over,'2 activation of absorptive processes,'3 and a
decline in passive permeability.'4 In the face of
small starvation or under-nutrition there is atrophy
er 1/2. of the mucosa, with shortening of the small
intestinal villi, leading to a reduction of absorp￾tive surface area.'5 Conversely, during preg￾nancy and lactation, when there is a rise in
f small nutrient requirements, the intestine undergoes
hypertrophy, with an increase in length,
diameter, villus height, and mucosal surface
area.'5 16 Starvation atrophy is not prevented by
parenteral nutrition alone, while the hyper￾x trophy of lactation is prevented by restricted
food intake. The portion of small intestine that
remains after resection has considerable capacity
for adaptation. In response to enteral nutrition it
may enlarge, not only in length and diameter,
but also in the dimensions of its villi and
crypts."'5 These adaptations, however, occur
against a background of more than adequate
gastrointestinal structural and functional reserve
in the healthy adult. Throughout postnatal life
there is a wide variation in small intestinal
length, suggesting more than sufficient, or even
surplus, absorptive surface area. The mean
length of the small intestine of an adult man is
about 550 cm, with a range of 350-700 cm
(Fig 1). This range of length represents a 100%
difference between minimum and maximum
values, and probably an equally wide range in
small intestinal surface area.
The data presented here were obtained from
necropsy specimens. Loss of muscle tone after
death leads to apparent lengthening of the small
5 intestine'8 and traction increases this by up to
4%.9 Although these measures of small intestinal
length may differ from those made in the living'8
the data reported here probably describe the true

Small intestinal length: afactor essentialfor gut adaptation 1323
adequate nutrient and fluid absorption is essen￾tial during gastrointestinal diseases that cause
rapid intestinal transit (such as gastroenteritis);
in those where there is a generalised or local
enteropathy (such as coeliac disease, cow's milk
protein intolerance, and Crohn's disease); when
a portion of the intestine has been resected or
bypassed; when the digestive phases of nutrient
assimilation are diminished (such as in pan￾creatic or hepatic disease, after gastrectomy etc);
and in the face of starvation, after severe
systemic disease, and other causes of under￾nutrition.
It therefore seems that there are two major
ways in which the small intestine adapts to
such pathophysiological changes. The first is
passively through its possession of more than
adequate surface area. The second is actively by
accelerated mucosal proliferation. Surplus small
intestinal length is an immediate defence against
excessive nutritional demands and gastro￾intestinal disease, while mucosal proliferation
permits a secondary, and more finely responsive
adaptation to them.
Figure 1 may be used to predict the length of
the small intestine at any particular age, and to
calculate what length remains after resection.
The neonatal period is that of peak prevalence of
diseases that may require intestinal resection,
leaving the growing infant at a considerable
disadvantage during a critical period of his or her
life. Loss of an appreciable portion of the small
intestine in the preterm infant will have a major
impact on the absorptive capacity of the newborn
who has not undergone the late gestational
acceleration in intestinal growth.'9
Like the tissues of the liver and pancreas
(other unpaired organs of the body), the absorp￾tive area of mucosa of the small intestine prob￾ably exceeds its basal needs, ensuring ample
reserve in the face of injury or disease. While its
exact dimensions are not critical, its surplus
length and well developed regenerative capacity
make up for its singularity.
Adaptability to variations in food quality,
quantity, and availability has been a major factor
accounting for the success and diversity of
mammalian species, allowing them to exploit a
wide range of nutritional niches. Primates have
digestive systems adapted to utilise a varied diet,2
and they undergo the major phases of intestinal
growth and development before they encounter
this. Together, the presence of a 'surplus' or
'reserve' small intestinal surface area, and of an
epithelium that is plastic and responsive to
environmental changes, arms the organism with
a robust and flexible means of responding to the
physiological and pathological challenges of eat￾ing an omnivorous diet and suffering gastro￾intestinal disease or damage.
