Abstract
Background: Caroli syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital disorder without pathognomonic clinical symptoms or
laboratory findings; therefore, the diagnosis is often delayed. The objective of this study was to investigate the
diagnostic delay and associated risk factors in CS patients.
Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 16 CS patients admitted to a single tertiary medical center on
mainland China. The diagnostic timelines of CS patients were reviewed to demonstrate the initial findings of CS at
diagnosis, the risk factors associated with diagnostic delay, and potential clues leading to early diagnosis.
Results: The median diagnostic delay was 1.75 years (range: 1 month to 29 years, interquartile range: 6.2 years) in 16
enrolled CS patients. Sex, age, and initial symptoms were not associated with diagnostic delay. 87.5% of CS patients
were diagnosed by imaging, and the accuracies of ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography were 25, 69.2, and 83.3%, respectively. The median diagnostic delays for
patients with or without CT performed at the first hospital visited according to physician and radiologist suspicion
of the diagnosis were 7.4 months and 6 years, respectively (p = 0.021). Hepatic cysts with splenomegaly were
detected by ultrasound in over half of CS patients.
Conclusions: The majority of CS patients were not diagnosed until complications of portal hypertension had already
developed. Recognition and early suspicion of the disease were important factors influencing diagnostic delay of CS. Hepatic
cysts plus splenomegaly detected by US might raise the clinical suspicion to include CS in the differential diagnosis.

Background
Caroli syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital disorder character￾ized by segmental dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts and
hepatic fibrosis [1]. The incidence of CS is estimated to be 1
per million of the population [2]. Although the pathoetiology
of CS is still poorly understood, CS is known to be an auto￾somal recessive hereditary disorder involving malformation
of the ductal plates and associated periportal fibrosis [3].
CS has no pathognomonic clinical symptoms or signs
[4]. It can manifest insidiously, with patients presenting
in two main ways: intrahepatic ductal ectasia and bile
stagnation (i.e., recurrent cholangitis and/or cholangio￾lithiasis) or portal hypertension (i.e., hypersplenism,
gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites) [5]. CS has also been
reported in association with cystic renal disease, pancre￾atic cysts, cavernomatous transformation of the portal
vein, and an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma [6].
Histopathology is useful for securing a definitive diagno￾sis, but imaging modalities including ultrasonography
(US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) remain the first-line diagnostic
methods due to their noninvasiveness and convenience
[7]. Although an early diagnosis of CS is the first step to
early intervention, complication control, and surveillance,
there is scarce evidence on the clinical parameters that in￾fluence early diagnosis or how imaging and their features
might influence the diagnostic timeline of CS patients [8].
We therefore performed a single-center retrospective
study to review the diagnostic timelines of 16 CS pa￾tients to investigate the clinical features at diagnosis, the
risk factors associated with diagnostic delay, and poten￾tial clues leading to early diagnosis.
Methods
Sixteen CS patients were admitted to Peking Union Med￾ical College Hospital between January 12,005 and August
12,019. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory results,
detailed imaging findings, associated conditions, histo￾pathology results, and other information related to CS
diagnosis including residential location, family history, and
hospitals visited were collected from the medical records.
A diagnostic timeline was drawn for each patient using
these data. We defined diagnostic delay as the time be￾tween initial clinical presentation and final diagnosis.
Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows Version
23.0 (IBM Statistics Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables
were reported as means ± standard deviation (SD) and
compared using Student’s t-test if determined as normally
distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test. Otherwise,
they were reported as median values with interquartile
ranges (IQR) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U
test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi￾squared test. Both continuous and categorical variables
were analyzed using logistic regression or Spearman’s
coefficient. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically sig￾nificant. Since diagnostic delay was not normally distrib￾uted, we took the natural logarithm (ln) of the diagnostic
delay (ln (diagnostic delay)), which was normally distrib￾uted, which allowed the use of t-tests with this variable.
Results
Demographic features
Ten CS patients were male and six were female, with a
male to female ratio of 5:3. The median age of symptom
onset was 7 years of age (range: 1 month to 38 years, IQR:
15.5 years), the median age of first clinic visit was 10 years
of age (range: 1 month to 38 years, IQR: 17.6 years), and the
median age at diagnosis was 15 years of age (range: 8
months to 39 years, IQR: 24.5 years). The median diagnostic
delay, which was defined as the time between initial clinical
presentation and final diagnosis, was 1.75 years (range: 1
month to 29 years, IQR: 6.2 years). Sex, age of symptom on￾set, age at first clinic visit, and age at diagnosis were not sig￾nificantly associated with diagnostic delay (Table 1).
Initial clinical presentation
Initial symptoms of the 16 CS patients included fever (n =
6), abdominal pain (n = 3), abdominal distention (n = 8),
gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1), and fatigue (n = 1). Most
initial symptoms led directly to a first clinic visit, with the
exception of three patients who had abdominal distention
as the initial symptom but only presented later to hospital

for other reasons (Table 2). None of these initial symptoms
were associated with diagnostic delay (Table 1). Three pa￾tients had a positive family history, but similarly this was
not associated with diagnostic delay (Table 1).
Laboratory findings
Laboratory findings at diagnosis included decreased per￾ipheral white blood cell count (n = 11), anemia (n = 11),
and decreased platelet count (n = 10). Ten patients had
pancytopenia. Some patients had abnormal liver function,
with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
(n = 2), elevated serum bilirubin (n = 2), decreased serum
albumin (n = 2), and prolonged prothrombin time (PT)
(n = 5). Of note, the two patients with elevated ALT had
cholangitis when admitted, and their ALT levels returned
to normal after anti-microbial treatment. Two patients
had increased serum creatinine levels, both of whom had
multiple renal cysts.
Positive autoantibodies were present in four CS patients:
antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were tested in ten patients
and two were positive; anti-mitochondrial antibodies (M2
subtype; AMA-M2) were tested in seven patients and two
were positive; and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)
were tested in seven patients and one was positive. Two
patients were initially misdiagnosed as having auto￾immune disease. The first misdiagnosed patient was a 21-
year-old man with positive ANA and slightly elevated as￾partate transaminase (AST) and immunoglobulin G (IgG),
who was misdiagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
and was treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine for
1 month. There was no clinical improvement, and histo￾pathological examination of his liver biopsy secured a
diagnosis of CS. The other misdiagnosed patient was a 33-
year-old woman who presented with low-grade fever and
abdominal distention who had positive ANA and AMA￾M2 and slightly elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase
(GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). She was initially
misdiagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and
treated with corticosteroids and ursodeoxycholic acid for
3 months. Again, there was no clinical improvement and
she developed recurrent cholangitis. Magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed, and
the diagnosis of CS was made according to typical imaging
findings. Her symptoms were soon controlled with antibi￾otics, and her GGT and ALP returned to normal.
Lower white blood cell (WBC) counts (5 years vs. 4
months; p = 0.01), lower platelet (PLT) counts (4.5 years
vs. 6.5 months; p = 0.01), and pancytopenia (4.5 years vs.
6.5 months; p = 0.01) at diagnosis were associated with
longer diagnostic delay. There were no other significant
associations between laboratory findings and diagnostic
delay (Table 1).
Imaging manifestations
All 16 CS patients were examined by US before diagno￾sis, 13 were examined by CT with or without contrast,
and 12 were investigated by MRCP. Some patients had
several imaging studies at different hospitals before the
final diagnosis was secured. On average, US was per￾formed 1.9 times and CT 1.3 times per patient before
diagnosis. The accuracies of US, CT, and MRCP were
25, 69.2, and 83.3%, respectively (Table 3). Fourteen pa￾tients were diagnosed by imaging, while two patients
were finally diagnosed from the histopathological ap￾pearances on liver biopsy.
All 16 patients had US performed during the first visit
to a hospital, while eight patients also had CT scans due
to suspicions raised by physicians and radiologists. CT
performed at the first hospital visited was associated
with a statistically significant shorter diagnostic delay
(p = 0.021; Table 1). The median diagnostic delays for
patients with CT performed or not performed at the first
hospital visit were 7.4 months and 6 years, respectively.
We examined the US signs in CS patients at their first
hospital visit. Diffusive hepatic lesions, hepatic cysts,
splenomegaly, and renal cysts were reported in 10
(62.5%), 10 (62.5%), 15 (93.8%), and 8 (50%) patients,

respectively. The combination of diffuse hepatic lesions
plus splenomegaly, hepatic cysts plus splenomegaly, and
renal cysts plus splenomegaly were found in 10 (62.5%),
9 (56.3%), and 8 (50%) patients, respectively (Table 4).
Diagnostic timelines
The diagnostic timelines of all 16 patients were drawn to
visualize important diagnostic time points, disease phase
at diagnosis, and imaging modalities used to make the
diagnosis (Fig. 1). We divided the CS course into three
phases: phase 1 (four patients, 25%), no proof of portal
hypertension (i.e., hypersplenism); phase 2 (ten patients,
62.5%), discovered complications of portal hypertension
without variceal bleeding; and phase 3 (2 patients, 12.5%),
at least one recorded variceal bleed.
Discussion
Caroli syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital disorder associ￾ated with ductal plate malformation and hepatic fibrosis
[9]. CS is usually diagnosed during childhood or adoles￾cence but may be diagnosed in adulthood [10, 11], con￾sistent with our findings. Fifty percent of our CS patients
developed symptoms before 6 years of age, and 18.75% of
patients had symptom onset in adulthood. However, only
25% patients were correctly diagnosed before 6 years and
37.5% patients were not diagnosed until adulthood. The
majority of patients already had complications of portal
hypertension at the time of diagnosis and some even had
severe gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophagogastric
varices. There was also a wide range of diagnostic delay in
our patients, from 1 month to as long as 29 years.
However, to our best knowledge, there is no published
evidence on the clinical factors influencing diagnostic
delay in CS patients, indicating that diagnostic delay of CS
patients might be a severe yet overlooked problem. We
therefore attempted to analyze possible factors associated
with diagnostic delay in CS patients to identify any clinical
clues that could facilitate earlier diagnosis.
As previously reported, CS patients can present with
fever and abdominal pain due to recurrent cholangitis, fa￾tigue and ecchymosis due to hypersplenism, gastrointes￾tinal bleeding due to varices, and non-specific digestive

symptoms such as anorexia and abdominal distention [1,
4]. The most common initial symptoms in CS patients in
our cohort were non-specific abdominal distention followed
by fever, abdominal pain, variceal bleeding, and fatigue. Al￾though three out of the eight patients initially presenting
with abdominal distention did not seek immediate medical
advice, which might have delayed the diagnosis of CS, there
was no significant difference in diagnostic delay between
patients with different initial symptoms.
Similarly, the laboratory findings in CS patients were
not discriminative. Leukopenia, thrombopenia, and pan￾cytopenia were associated with longer diagnostic delay.
However, this was likely to be due to patients with longer
diagnostic delay being more likely to have hypersplenism.
Other laboratory abnormalities including increased ALT
and bilirubin, decreased albumin, and prolonged PT were
not associated with diagnostic delay. Interestingly, auto￾antibodies were positive in four (25%) of our CS patients,
which has not previously been reported. Although the
presence of these autoantibodies in AIH and PBC is well
established, these autoantibodies are not reported to be
associated with CS [12], which might therefore mislead
the diagnosis. Indeed, these positive autoantibody results
did lead to, or at least contribute to, the initial misdiag￾nosis of two CS patients. It is important to be aware of the
co-existence of autoantibodies and CS, since immunosup￾pressive therapy might lead to clinical exacerbation of CS.
Imaging studies remain the primary diagnostic modality
in patients with CS due to their non-invasiveness com￾pared to liver biopsy, which when performed is usually to
establish the degree of fibrosis [1, 4]. Although a range of
PKHD1 mutations are associated with CS, the diagnosis is
usually made through the characteristic clinical picture,
typical imaging features with or without histological con￾firmation, and exclusion of other hepatic diseases leading
to hepatic fibrosis and bile duct dilatation. Most (87.5%)
of our patients were diagnosed according to typical im￾aging features by US, CT, and MRI. The diagnosis of CS
relies on demonstrating cystic dilatation of intrahepatic
bile ducts in continuity with the biliary tree as well as
signs of hepatic fibrosis. US features of the liver in CS in￾clude intrahepatic cystic anechoic areas in which fibrovas￾cular bundles, stones, and linear bridging or septa may be
present [1, 13]. Nevertheless, it is often difficult for radiol￾ogists to differentiate by US intrahepatic cysts caused by
CS from cysts arising through other causes such as poly￾cystic liver disease, and interobserver variability according
to radiologist experience in making the diagnosis of CS
has been reported [13]. In our study, the accuracy of diag￾nosing CS by US was only 25%, and some patients were
not successfully diagnosed by US at first but were later di￾agnosed by another US performed in another hospital.
Taking this interobserver variance into account, the actual
accuracy of US for CS might be even lower.
In our study, CT scans were much more accurate than
US (69.2%). The “central dot sign” on CT (Fig. 2), which
refers to small foci of strong contrast enhancement
within cystic lesions, is thought to correspond to portal
radicles bridging dilatations and thus be pathognomonic
of CS [14]. MRCP can establish the diagnosis of CS by
revealing connections between bile duct ectasias and the
normal biliary tract (Fig. 3) as well as ruling out other
conditions like multiple liver abscesses and polycystic
liver disease [13, 14]. The accuracy of MRCP was 83.3%
in our study, similar to previously reported [5, 13]. In
our study, the use of MRI/MRCP was limited, particu￾larly in children. This was because: (i) MRI examination
requires good patient cooperation, and it its often diffi￾cult for children to cooperate with the examination; (ii)

intrahepatic bile ducts (arrow) and tiny dots of strong contrast within,
which is the central dot sign (arrowhead)
Fig. 3 MRCP in a CS patient showing dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts

patients are not usually sedated during MRI in China,
even in tertiary hospitals, not least due to the limited re￾sources of many patients; and (iii) CT scans are cheaper
than MRI/MRCP, and CT scans are usually better cov￾ered by medical insurance than MRI/MRCP in most
areas of China. Nevertheless, patients who had a CT
scan performed due to physician or radiologist suspicion
at the first hospital visited had a significantly shorter
diagnostic delay. This was the only risk factor associated
with diagnostic delay in our study, suggesting that a high
index of suspicion for the disease might be the most im￾portant factor influencing diagnostic delay in CS, whose
rarity often leads to poor awareness of the condition and
thus misdiagnosis.
Due to the retrospective nature of the study, we were
only able to locate the previous CT images in four pa￾tients (two CT and two contrast CT scans), with the lon￾gest interval of 4 years between previous and current CT
scans. These scans reported non-specific findings such
as “hepatic cyst”, “polycystic liver”, and “focal cystic mass
of bile duct”, with some cases also reporting “dilatations
of intrahepatic bile ducts”. These scans were compared
by an experienced radiologist, and no significant differ￾ences were observed between the previous and current
Fig. 4 A proposed clinical practice workflow when there is a suspicion of CS

CT scans. This finding is consistent with our suggestion
that the low index of suspicion for CS might be the most
important factor leading to diagnostic delay. However,
since these comparative imaging data are limited and
the intervals between CT scans were relatively short, fur￾ther studies are required to further investigate radio￾logical misdiagnosis.
US was nearly always the first-line imaging modality
due to its low cost and convenience, despite its subopti￾mal accuracy. Splenomegaly, diffusive hepatic lesions,
and hepatic cysts were the most common US findings in
CS. When combined, diffusive hepatic lesions plus
splenomegaly and hepatic cysts plus splenomegaly were
found in over half of our CS patients. However, diffusive
hepatic lesions plus splenomegaly can also be found in a
variety of other conditions including portal hypertension
caused by thrombosis or dysplasia of the portal venous
system, congenital disorders such as Niemann-Pick dis￾ease, congenital hepatic fibroses other than CS, and even
malignancies like lymphoma [15]. Hepatic cysts with
splenomegaly have a narrower differential diagnosis,
mainly other hepatic cystic diseases including polycystic
kidney disease [16], hepatic peribiliary cysts (which only
rarely lead to splenomegaly) [17], and, even more rarely,
malignant cystic diseases of the liver and spleen, which
are easily differentiated [18]. Thus, hepatic cysts plus
splenomegaly on US might provide a useful clue to phy￾sicians and thus might shorten the diagnostic delay of
CS. Based on our results, Fig. 4 shows our proposed
clinical practice workflow when CS is suspected.
This study has several limitations. First, the study was
retrospective, and although we detected possible risk factors
associated with diagnostic delay of CS patients, they require
further verification. Second, since CS is rare the sample was
relatively small, and the results require validation in larger
samples. Third, we took the natural logarithm of diagnostic
delay to make it normally distributed so that it could be
compared using the t-test, which is more susceptible to
outliers than the U test. Finally, we are a tertiary hospital
and this is a single-center study, which could introduce bias
in that patients sent to our hospital might be more compli￾cated and difficult to diagnose.
Conclusions
CS can be insidious and has no distinguishing symptoms
or laboratory findings. The majority of patients were not
diagnosed until complications of portal hypertension
had already developed. Some patients might have posi￾tive autoantibodies, which could be deceptive and lead
to misdiagnosis. US was not ideally accurate, but hepatic
cysts with splenomegaly detected by US might raise the
diagnostic index of suspicion for CS. Early suspicion of
the disease might be the most important factor influen￾cing diagnostic delay of CS.
