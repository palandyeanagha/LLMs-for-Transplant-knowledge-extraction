INTRODUCTION
Interpretation of rare genetic variation, whether in a clini￾cal diagnostic or research setting, has not kept pace with the 
accelerating data generation using high-throughput DNA 
sequencing. Increasingly extensive gene panels, as well as 
whole-exome and genome sequencing, are used to interro￾gate the growing number of genes implicated in Mendelian 
diseases.1
 However, such panels only modestly increase the 
number of high-confidence diagnostic results while iden￾tifying ever larger numbers of variants of uncertain signifi￾cance2,3; these inconclusive results not only reduce the clinical 
utility of testing but also can lead to misinterpretation and 
misdiagnosis.
Central to the challenge of rare variant interpretation is 
the paradox that individually rare variants are now seen to 
be collectively common. Although it is accepted that a com￾mon variant can be excluded as a cause of a rare and penetrant 
Mendelian disease, the community has been slower to recog￾nize that many rare variants identified in Mendelian disease 
genes are innocent bystanders and some “rare” variants are not 
rare at all. Recent population sequencing efforts have raised 
awareness of these issues (e.g., the 1000 Genomes Project,4
the Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.
edu/EVS)), but the full extent is now revealed in the Exome 
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) data set (http://exac.broadin￾stitute.org), in which the average exome contains 7.6 rare non￾synonymous variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1%) in 
well-characterized dominant disease genes, with the majority 
being very rare or “private.”5
 Clearly, only a small minority can 
actually cause a penetrant Mendelian disease.6

Purpose: The accurate interpretation of variation in Mendelian 
disease genes has lagged behind data generation as sequencing has 
become increasingly accessible. Ongoing large sequencing efforts 
present huge interpretive challenges, but they also provide an invalu￾able opportunity to characterize the spectrum and importance of rare 
variation.
Methods: We analyzed sequence data from 7,855 clinical cardio￾myopathy cases and 60,706 Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) 
reference samples to obtain a better understanding of genetic varia￾tion in a representative autosomal dominant disorder.
Results: We found that in some genes previously reported as impor￾tant causes of a given cardiomyopathy, rare variation is not clinically 
informative because there is an unacceptably high likelihood of false￾positive interpretation. By contrast, in other genes, we find that diag￾nostic laboratories may be overly conservative when assessing variant 
pathogenicity.
Conclusions: We outline improved analytical approaches that evalu￾ate which genes and variant classes are interpretable and propose that 
these will increase the clinical utility of testing across a range of Men￾delian diseases.

Reassessment of Mendelian gene pathogenicity in cardiomyopathy cases | WALSH et al Original Research Article
The challenges of variant interpretation in Mendelian disorders 
are particularly well illustrated by inherited cardiomyopathies: 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy 
(DCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 
(ARVC). These largely autosomal dominant disorders are rela￾tively common, genetically heterogeneous, and medically impor￾tant;7
 consequently, cardiomyopathy genes feature prominently 
in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 
list of proposed genes to be routinely analyzed in all exome or 
genome sequencing.8
 Although clinical genetic testing in cardio￾myopathy has been available for more than a decade, the number 
of genes reported as disease-causing has increased dramatically 
in recent years, often without robust evidence.
Here, we leveraged two substantial resources to better under￾stand and interpret rare variation in cardiomyopathy genes. 
We compared sequence data from 7,855 individuals who had 
a clinical diagnosis of cardiomyopathy with 60,706 reference 
samples from the ExAC consortium, the first data set powered 
to assess variant alleles present in the population at a range of 
1:1,000–100,000 that might previously have been considered 
pathogenic yet may in fact be too common to cause penetrant 
Mendelian disease.
Through these analyses, we aimed to define the genes, regions 
of genes, and/or classes of variants that can be reliably inter￾preted in a clinical setting and in doing so enhance variant 
interpretation and increase clinical diagnostic yields.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical and control cohorts
Data from 3,267 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of HCM, 
559 with DCM, and 361 with ARVC were obtained from the 
Oxford Medical Genetics Laboratory for up to 16 genes for HCM, 
28 genes for DCM, and 8 genes for ARVC (Supplementary 
Table S1a online). Data from Partners Laboratory of Molecular 
Medicine (LMM) were downloaded from the supplemental 
files of previous publications and included data from up to 18 
genes sequenced in 632–2,912 HCM patients9
 and up to 46 
genes sequenced in 121–756 DCM patients3
 (Supplementary 
Table S1b online). Because there were no significant differences 
in the proportion of cases of rare variants in each gene between 
the two laboratories (Fisher’s exact test), the data were com￾bined (Supplementary Table S3a,b online).
Data were downloaded from ExAC (http://exac.broadinsti￾tute.org; version 0.3, January 2015). Only genes with a high 
proportion of coding regions covered to a median sequence 
depth of >30× and only high-quality (PASS filter) variants were 
included in our analyses. In addition, we adjusted the total 
number of ExAC samples per gene based on the mean coverage 
at the variant sites of interest.
Please refer to Supplementary Note S1 online for more 
detailed information on each component cohort.
Defining an allele frequency threshold for rare variation
The single most common confirmed pathogenic variant in both 
clinical cohorts was MYBPC3 c.1504C>T (p.Arg502Trp), which 
was found in 104/6,179 HCM cases (1.7%; 95 CI: 1.4–2.0%); 
this variant was only observed three times in ExAC (MAF 
2.5×10−5). We therefore applied a MAF threshold of 1×10−4
as a conservative upper bound because variants more frequent 
than this in the general population would not be expected to 
be highly penetrant pathogenic mutations (see Supplementary 
Note S2 online). This MAF does not exclude the possibility of 
more common deleterious founder variants in specific popula￾tions where the genetic architecture of cardiomyopathy is not 
well defined.
Calculation of rare variant frequency in cardiomyopathy 
and ExAC cohorts
For each gene, the frequency of rare variants (MAF <1×10−4) in 
ExAC was calculated by dividing the sum of the adjusted allele 
count by the mean of the total adjusted alleles. The frequency 
of rare variation in the cardiomyopathy cohorts was calcu￾lated by dividing the sum of rare variants identified in cardio￾myopathy cases by the total number of patients analyzed for 
each gene. Only likely protein-altering variants in designated 
canonical transcripts (Supplementary Table S2 online) were 
analyzed: missense, in-frame insertions/deletions, frameshift, 
nonsense, and variants affecting the splice donor and accep￾tor regions (first and last two bases of each intron). Analyses 
were performed for all protein-altering variants and separately 
for variants predicted to be nontruncating (missense and in￾frame insertions and deletions) and truncating (frameshift, 
nonsense, splice donor/acceptor). To ensure that population￾specific variants did not have a confounding effect on this anal￾ysis, we compared the results seen in the LMM DCM cohort 
for all samples and for Caucasians only (see Supplementary 
Note S4 online).
In total, after data from both clinical laboratories were 
combined and poorly covered genes in ExAC were excluded, 
20 genes sequenced in 632–6,179 HCM patients, 46 genes 
sequenced in 121–1,315 DCM patients, and 8 genes sequenced 
in 93–361 ARVC patients were analyzed. See Supplementary 
Table S2 online for full details of cohort sizes for each gene.
Comparison of variation between cardiomyopathy and 
ExAC cohorts
For each gene, the frequency of rare variation in the clini￾cal cohort was compared with that in ExAC. Case excess was 
defined by subtracting the proportion of individuals in ExAC 
with a filtered variant from the proportion in the clinical cohort. 
We made the simplifying assumption that the frequency of rare 
benign variants was equivalent in cases and ExAC, and that the 
frequency of pathogenic variants in ExAC is sufficiently low so 
as not to affect this comparison. A Fisher’s exact test was per￾formed to test the significance of observed excess in cases.
For each gene and variant class, we calculated two related 
metrics: the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence inter￾vals and the etiological fraction (EF)10–12 (calculated as: (OR￾1)/OR × 100; for further information on EF please refer to 
Supplementary Note S3 online). These metrics were calculated

for all protein-altering variants and separately for predicted 
nontruncating and truncating subsets.
All statistical tests used in these analyses are two-sided, unless 
otherwise stated, and analysis was undertaken using Stata sta￾tistical analysis software (StataCorp. 2007. Stata Statistical 
Software: Release 10. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.).
Distribution of missense variants in MYH7
To identify putative hotspots of pathogenic missense mutations 
in MYH7, distinct rare missense variants from the HCM, DCM, 
and ExAC cohorts were mapped along the protein sequence. 
Nonrandom mutation cluster (NMC),13 implemented in the 
iPAC Bioconductor R package, was used to identify clusters 
of variants in each cohort (R source code of NMC algorithm: 
https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iPAC.
html).
Analysis of research cardiomyopathy cohorts
Research cardiomyopathy cohorts are defined as published 
studies from research laboratories where patient samples 
were subjected to sequencing across panels of cardiac genes. 
The HCM research cohort14 sequenced 874 patients across 
35 genes (12 associated primarily with HCM, 7 with DCM, 7 
with ARVC, and 9 with arrhythmias, as stated by Lopes et al.). 
The DCM research cohort15–17 comprised 312–324 patients 
sequenced for 12 confirmed and putative DCM genes (not 
including TTN). Putative pathogenic variants in these 
studies are not identified by clinical-grade classification 
but rather by criteria such as variant type, population fre￾quency, and in silico algorithm prediction—the details of 
the criteria used in each study are described in the pub￾lished articles.
Rare variant frequencies and case excess were calculated 
for each gene as described for the clinical cohorts. The num￾ber of variants reported to be putatively pathogenic for each 
gene in these studies was compared with the number pre￾dicted to be pathogenic based on the case excess observed in 
these cohorts.
HGMD cardiomyopathy mutations in ExAC
Variants in the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD; 
professional version 2015.1) associated with HCM, DCM, or 
ARVC (“disease-causing mutations” with a HGMD tag of DM 
and DM?) were identified based on manual curation of the 
HGMD disease terms. The total allele frequency and count from 
ExAC were extracted for each variant. Polymorphisms (ExAC 
MAF >1×10−2) were removed from the analysis. The number of 
HGMD variants present in ExAC was calculated at any frequency 
and with MAF >1×10−4. The total number of ExAC alleles and 
the total number of ExAC individuals with HGMD-associated 
cardiomyopathy variants were also calculated for each disease. 
Additionally, the ExAC frequencies of HGMD cardiomyopathy 
variants previously observed only once in the Exome Sequencing 
Project were analyzed to assess how the enhanced resolution of 
ExAC can clarify previously uninterpretable variants.
RESULTS
Comparison of rare variation between cardiomyopathy 
cohorts and ExAC
Variants identified by sequencing of putative cardiomyopathy 
genes in cases (n = 7,855) were collated by disease and gene 
(Supplementary Table S1a,b online). We compared the bur￾den of rare protein-altering variants (ExAC MAF <1×10−4) 
detected in 20 HCM genes, 48 DCM genes, and 8 ARVC genes 
in HCM, DCM, and ARVC cases, respectively, with the burden 
observed in ExAC. Predicted truncating and nontruncating 
variants were analyzed separately (Table 1 and Supplementary 
Table S4a–c online).
As expected,18–20 rare variation in the two major HCM 
genes accounted for the majority of variation in HCM cases 
(MYBPC3, 19.0% of cases; MYH7, 14.2%). Rare variants were 
less numerous in other well-characterized HCM genes (TNNI3, 
TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, ACTC1, PLN) and phenocopy 
genes (GLA, LAMP2, PRKAG2) (≤2% cases per gene). For each 
of these genes there is a significant (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni 
correction) excess of variation in cases as compared with ExAC, 
thus confirming their association with disease (Figure 1 and 
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5a online). However, 
for several more recently reported HCM genes (TNNC121, 
MYOZ222, ACTN223, ANKRD124) there was no significant excess 
of rare genetic variation in these HCM cases.
DCM is highly genetically heterogeneous, with up to ~60 
implicated genes.20,25,26 In the clinical cohorts, truncating vari￾ants in TTN were most common (14.6%), in accordance with 
our findings in large research cohorts.27,28 The prevalence of rare 
variants in other well-characterized DCM genes was modest 
(MYH7, 5.3%; LMNA, 4.4%; TNNT2, 2.9%; and TPM1, 1.9%) 
but significantly enriched compared with ExAC (Figure 1 and 
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5b online). However, with 
the exception of truncating variants in DSP (2.8%), there was 
limited burden and modest or no significant excess variation 
in the remaining 40 genes tested. In ARVC, the five major 
genes each showed significant excess in cases (Table 1 and 
Supplementary Table S5c online).
Overall, the yield of pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic 
(LP) variants was 32% for HCM, 13% for DCM (but note that 
TTN was only sequenced in one-third of samples), and 36% for 
ARVC. Of note, in the genes robustly supported by an excess 
of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, even variants of 
uncertain significance were seen in excess over ExAC, sug￾gesting that clinical laboratories may be overly conservative 
(Figure 1).
Interpretation of variation by gene and variant class
Many variants in confirmed disease genes can be interpreted 
with confidence based on cumulative experience (e.g., multi￾ple occurrences of segregation in families, de novo mutations, 
founder variants) and/or functional insights (e.g., null alleles 
in haploinsufficient genes). However, our ability to evaluate the 
pathogenicity of novel variants depends on the signal-to-noise 
ratio. For each gene and variant class, we calculated two related

metrics: the odds ratio (OR) (ratio of odds of cardiomyopa￾thy comparing rare variant carriers with noncarriers) and the 
etiological fraction (EF), which is a commonly used measure 
in epidemiology10–12 that estimates the proportion of cases in 
which the exposure (in this case, a rare variant in a gene) was 
causal (see Supplementary Note S3 online).
These analyses reaffirm high ORs and EFs in key cardiomyop￾athy genes and also highlight a number of previously reported 
cardiomyopathy genes that show limited disease association 
when compared with a very large number of reference samples 
(Figure 2 and Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5a–c online). 
As expected, many genes have divergent results for truncating 
as compared with nontruncating variants; for example, MYH7
has an OR of 1 (0.5–4.5) for truncating variants versus an OR of 
12 (10.9–13.3) for nontruncating variants in HCM cases.
This observation confirms the widely accepted view that 
missense alleles of MYH7 act as dominant negatives in HCM 
whereas truncating variants are not pathogenic. In genes whose 
truncating alleles are disease-causing, ORs are typically higher 
owing to the lower rate of truncating variants in the popula￾tion. As expected, truncating variation in MYBPC3 associates 
strongly with HCM (the result of haploinsufficiency29), but nei￾ther truncating nor nontruncating variants in MYBPC3 show a 
significant association with DCM (OR = 1.3 (0.8–1.8); EF = 0.21 
(0–0.46)), which is a finding that fits with mechanistic insights 
but challenges some widely held viewpoints.15,30 Among the 
ARVC genes, truncating alleles are informative for four major 
genes (and particularly common for PKP2 and DSP), whereas 
nontruncating variants in these genes are difficult to interpret 
reliably (Figure 2 and Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S4c 
and S5c online).
Using protein domain knowledge to improve variant 
interpretation
At the gene level, ORs for nontruncating variants are typi￾cally modest; in the absence of prior clinical experience or 
functional data, interpretation is often uncertain. This may 
be improved by considering protein topology because patho￾genic variants often cluster in specific regions in cases.31,32
We evaluated the distribution of rare missense alleles in 
MYH7, which encodes a protein with well-characterized 
functional and structural domains to determine whether sys￾tematic analysis of variant distribution refines interpretation. 
Nonrandom mutation cluster analysis13 revealed a signifi￾cant cluster (P < 3 × 10−15; false discovery rate q < 5×10−13) 
between residues 181 and 937 in HCM cases, whereas in 
ExAC variants were depleted in this region and instead clus￾tered between residues 1,271 and 1,903 (P < 3 ×10−8; false 
discovery rate q < 4 × 10−5) (Figure 3a). These data more 
precisely define the boundaries of mutation-enriched and 
depleted zones that can be used to generate more discrimi￾nating EFs; for example, for rare variants in HCM patients,

EFs range from 0.97 in the HCM cluster to 0.67 in the control 
cluster (Figure 3a,b).
Application of findings
To facilitate the application of these findings for research and 
clinical use, we provide an overview of the genetic landscape 
of cardiomyopathy as represented by patient referrals received 
by UK and US clinical testing laboratories. This shows the rela￾tive importance of cardiomyopathy genes within these patient 
populations (measured as a “case excess”) and their interpret￾ability (expressed as the etiological fraction) (Figure 3b,c). 
Furthermore, we have created a Web resource, Atlas of Cardiac 
Genetic Variation (http://cardiodb.org/ACGV), to aid those 
assessing the relevance of specific genes and classes of variants 
to cardiomyopathies.
Reassessing extended gene panel cardiomyopathy 
research studies
Several research studies14,15,17,30 using extended gene panels 
have reported genetic overlap between diverse cardiac diseases 
that appear at odds with known disease mechanisms. We sur￾mise that many such studies have not adequately accounted 
for background genetic variation, have relied on variant data 
from incompletely annotated disease-centered databases, and 
have not used segregation. Here, using ExAC data, we present a 
reanalysis of two representative research studies.14–17
Figure 3 Variant interpretation. (a) Distribution of rare (Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) minor allele frequency <1 × 10−4) MYH7 missense variants 
in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (n = 864) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (n = 69) clinical cohorts and ExAC (n = 816), with the key myosin protein 
regions highlighted. Using nonrandom mutation cluster analysis (NMC), (refer to Supplementary Methods online), a significant variant cluster (P < 3×10−15, 
false discovery rate (FDR), q < 5×10−13) was identified between residues 181 and 937 (involving the motor domain, lever arm, and part of the rod) in HCM 
cases, and depletion in this region and a significant cluster (P < 3×10−8, FDR q < 4×10−5) was identified between residues 1,271 and 1,903 (in the part of the 
rod that forms the filament backbone) in ExAC samples. The etiological fraction (EF) for a rare MYH7 missense variant identified in a HCM proband ranges 
from 0.97 in the HCM cluster to 0.67 in the control cluster. Vertical gray bars depict the positions of variants in cohorts; grayscale shows variant density where 
variants are coincident. An overview of the genetic landscape of HCM (b) and DCM (c) for truncating (blue) and nontruncating (gray) variants, as well as 
MYH7 missense variants in the clusters identified in (a) (orange, disease cluster; yellow, ExAC control cluster). The case excess (y-axis) is the frequency of rare 
variation in disease cohorts over and above the frequency in ExAC and indicates the relative importance of the gene and variant class to the genetic etiology 
of each cardiomyopathy. The etiological fraction (EF) (x-axis) is an estimate of the proportion of affected carriers where the variant caused the disease; it is a 
measure of the interpretability of variants of this class (see Supplementary Table S4a,b online for full details). This measure is an average of all variants of a 
given class; some of which will be pathogenic but others will be benign.

Original Research Article WALSH et al | Reassessment of Mendelian gene pathogenicity in cardiomyopathy cases
In the research HCM cases, the excess variation in the known 
HCM genes (e.g., MYBPC3, MYH7) is substantial. By contrast, 
the measured variation in DCM, ARVC, and ion channel genes 
in the HCM patients—although also substantial—is similar to 
that seen in ExAC with little, if any, excess burden (Figure 4a and 
Supplementary Table S6 online). This suggests that the majority 
of these variants, although individually rare, are benign bystanders, 
and that any overlap between the disorders has been overestimated.
Figure 4 Comparison of the number of variants reported as putatively pathogenic in research studies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (a) and 
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (b) in research studies (using generic analysis criteria such as variant class, missense-effect predictions, and variant population 
frequency in the Exome Sequencing Project) with those predicted as pathogenic by the excess of variation in cases over Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) in 
each gene. For the HCM study14 (a), genes are colored according to the cardiac disease for which they are primarily associated, as defined by Lopes et al.14 Although 
there is good concordance between the research findings and the ExAC predictions for established HCM genes, for genes primarily associated with DCM, ARVC, 
and arrhythmias, the variation in cases is similar to that in ExAC. In the DCM study15–17 (b), variation burden in MYBPC3, SCN5A, and MYH6 is similar between the 
published research cases and ExAC, suggesting that most variants in these genes are unlikely to cause DCM.

Reassessment of Mendelian gene pathogenicity in cardiomyopathy cases | WALSH et al Original Research Article
In the DCM research studies, some genes proposed on 
the basis of these and other recent studies as among the 
most common causes of DCM (e.g., MYBPC3, MYH6, and 
SCN5A15,17,30) in fact showed no excess variation (Figure 4b and 
Supplementary Table S7 online).
Reassessment of variants previously reported as 
pathogenic
We examined the ExAC frequency of variants previously 
reported to cause HCM, DCM, or ARVC, as catalogued by 
HGMD (Supplementary Tables S8–S10 online). A substan￾tial number of purported disease-causing variants for HCM 
(25.2%; 322/1,280), DCM (29.2%; 222/759), and ARVC (34.6%, 
167/483) were observed in ExAC. Although presence in ExAC 
does not preclude pathogenicity, a significant number are pres￾ent at a frequency incompatible with causation of penetrant 
cardiomyopathy (6.5% of HCM, 11.9% of DCM, and 13.5% of 
ARVC variants are present at MAF >1×10−4; Supplementary 
Tables S11 and S12 online). Of HGMD variants that could not 
be excluded as disease-causing using the Exome Sequencing 
Project (the largest control data set prior to ExAC) due to an 
allele count of one, 75% can now be discounted by ExAC refine￾ment. In total, 11.7, 19.6, and 20.1% of individuals in ExAC 
have reported HCM, DCM, and ARVC variants, respectively; 
this is far in excess of disease prevalence. Hence, variant priori￾tization based on HGMD status alone is not advised for cardio￾myopathy genes, a fact that is increasingly apparent with larger 
control data sets.
DISCUSSION
We present an analysis of data from 7,855 individuals referred 
for clinical diagnostic testing for inherited cardiomyopathies, 
along with 60,706 ExAC reference samples. These data exem￾plify the many challenges of variant interpretation in genetically 
heterogeneous disorders. We propose that in the absence of a 
large matched case–control series, the approaches described 
here, using data from large patient cohorts and broader refer￾ence data sets such as ExAC, may be applied to a range of mul￾tigenic, multiallelic diseases.
We show that the pathogenicity of disease genes originally 
identified through family linkage is resoundingly validated, for 
example, the majority of sarcomere genes in HCM. However, 
genes implicated in cardiomyopathy through candidate gene 
studies, including genes on panel tests in routine clinical use, 
are often not convincingly associated with disease. For exam￾ple, MYBPC3, MYH6, and SCN5A have all been reported to be 
major contributors to DCM15,17,30 but show little or no excess 
burden despite adequate numbers and power; instead, we see 
that these are in fact genes that have the highest background 
variation.
We also show that it is crucial not only to distinguish vari￾ant classes but also to assess these in light of known disease 
mechanisms for each gene and disorder. For example, car￾diomyopathy-causing variant in most myofilament proteins 
incorporate into the sarcomere and act as dominant negatives 
(HCM mutations are activating, whereas DCM mutations 
decrease myofibrillar function).33 Hence, protein-truncating 
variants that do not incorporate would not be expected to cause 
these conditions, and this is borne out in our data. By contrast, 
MYBPC3 truncation alleles cause HCM through haploinsuf￾ficiency, making it unlikely that they could also cause DCM, 
which we confirm with our findings.
We summarize our analyses of cardiomyopathy genes in two 
measures, capturing the contribution of each gene to a disease 
(case excess) and our ability to interpret variation in each gene 
(etiological fraction (EF)). EF can be interpreted as the propor￾tion of affected carriers in which the variant caused the disease 
(i.e., the proportion of true positives). EF is based on pooled 
rare variant frequency data, so it summarizes the average risk 
across many variants in a gene (some of which will be patho￾genic but others will be benign) and will be particularly useful 
for selecting panels of genes that are informative for discrete 
phenotypes. Of critical importance, the probability that a novel 
variant is pathogenic depends on the clinical status of the indi￾vidual carrying the variant and will be considerably lower in 
individuals with a remote/unrelated clinical diagnosis. This 
will be even more problematic with incidental findings during 
exome or genome sequencing with major implications for the 
recommendations to return apparently actionable findings.8
Although detailed phenotyping of the clinical cases was not 
available, we are confident that the clinical diagnoses are robust 
because the current clinical practice is to test only individuals 
with a confirmed diagnosis.19,20 The proportion of cases with 
inherited cardiomyopathy is unknown because evidence of 
familial disease is not a requirement for testing. The clinical 
sensitivity (proportion of patients with a pathogenic variant) in 
our case series was lower than that of previous surveys, which 
may reflect more restricted testing of stringently selected cases, 
typically from multiply affected families with severe disease.34,35
However, the cohorts studied are representative of those 
encountered by clinical diagnostic laboratories, rather than a 
highly selected subset.
Despite high levels of confidence in interpreting many 
well-characterized variants (which may give ORs in the hun￾dreds), diagnostic laboratories are understandably cautious 
when interpreting a variant that has not been seen before. Our 
analyses demonstrate that for many genes even variants cur￾rently reported with variants of uncertain significance show a 
several-fold excess over the background in ExAC (Figure 1). 
More refined interpretation of variants in validated genes, for 
example, leveraging domain information, could increase the 
diagnostic yield of genetic testing and is likely to lead to much 
more substantial gains than the expansion of gene panels.
In contrast to the conservative strategy of clinical laborato￾ries, research studies often report large “yields.” Some may not 
adequately control for the background rate of rare variation 
or may include genes for other conditions; as a result, genes 
nominated as important contributors to disease have little if 
any excess variation in cases. Testing of broad gene panels and 
overly inclusive interpretation of variants may lead to erroneous

conclusions about pleiotropic effects of genetic variation14,30
and overestimates of double/compound mutations36 and the 
population prevalence of the disease.37
Despite the absence of demonstrable excess of rare varia￾tion in a gene, specific variants identified in family studies 
may still be disease-causing. However, if such variants are a 
small minority of rare variants in cases, then testing will yield 
more false positives than true positives. For some of the genes 
that show no excess (Figure 1), the original reports did not 
include any variant with robust evidence of segregation (i.e., 
LOD >3), and the possibility exists that the reported disease 
association is entirely spurious. An argument is often made 
that variants could be contributing as modifiers.38,39 This 
remains possible; however, in the absence of any significant 
overrepresentation in cases, the more parsimonious inter￾pretation is that they are phenotypically silent. We have not 
tested more common variants (MAF >1 × 10−4) that could be 
mechanistically informative but are likely to have smaller 
effects,40 and we have not evaluated individual-level data to 
assess the impact of coinheritance of variants, which are limi￾tations of the analyses.
A further limitation of this study is that the case and ExAC 
data were not generated using a single sequencing method; 
none of the methods used was expected to have 100% sensi￾tivity for variant detection. Although these technical limita￾tions could have marginal effects on estimates of rare variant 
frequency and OR/EF values, we do not expect them to alter 
the key conclusions of this study. Because ethnicity data were 
not available for the Oxford Medical Genetics Laboratory or 
LMM HCM patients, we were unable to confirm the extent 
to which the cohorts used in this study were matched by race. 
However, by studying the aggregate burden of multiple very 
rare variants, we expect that any confounding effects by indi￾vidual population-specific variants in cases or ExAC will be 
limited. Supporting this assumption, an analysis of the LMM 
DCM cohort comparing findings from all populations with the 
Caucasian-only subsets revealed that the conclusions are robust 
(Supplementary Table S13 online).
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that new opportunities 
for large-scale comparison of rare variation in Mendelian dis￾ease genes between patient cohorts and the wider population 
can identify the genes, regions of genes, and/or classes of vari￾ants that can be reliably interpreted in a clinical setting. For val￾idated disease genes, there is clear potential to increase the yield 
of correctly interpreted, actionable variants. At the same time, 
problems must be avoided by recognizing that many implicated 
genes, as well as a significant proportion of variants, may not 
be robust. As clinical genetic testing moves to ever-larger gene 
panels and whole-exome and genome sequencing, an under￾standing of gene and variant pathogenicity will be increasingly 
important to deliver reliable interpretation.
