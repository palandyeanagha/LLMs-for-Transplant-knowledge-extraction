Background: A biologically plausible link between gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), aspiration, and lung
allograft dysfunction has been suggested, but there is no systematic evidence indicating the presence of gastric
contents in the lung. We have tested the hypothesis that pepsin, as a marker of aspiration, is detectable in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of allograft recipients who had not reported symptoms of GOR.
Methods: Standardised 3660 ml surveillance BAL fluid samples from 13 chronologically sequential stable
lung allograft recipients without chronic rejection (10 patients treated with a prophylactic proton pump
inhibitor) were studied. Lavage supernatants were assayed by an ELISA based on a monospecific goat
antibody for pepsin/pepsinogen. Pepsin levels were compared with those from four normal volunteer
controls.
Results: Pepsin levels were measurable in all allograft recipients, in keeping with gastric aspiration
(median 109 ng/ml (range 35–1375)). In the control group the pepsin levels were below the limit of
detection. Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor was not correlated with pepsin levels. There was no
correlation between BAL fluid neutrophils and pepsin levels.
Conclusion: These data demonstrate lung epithelial lining fluid concentrations of pepsin in lung allograft
recipients which are much higher than blood reference levels, with no detectable pepsin in controls. This
provides direct evidence of gastric aspiration, which is potentially injurious to the allograft.
Human lung transplantation is a well accepted ther￾apeutic option for selected patients with advanced
cardiopulmonary disease, but long term survival is
limited by the development of obliterative bronchiolitis, the
physiological hallmark of which is the bronchiolitis obliter￾ans syndrome.1 The pathophysiology of obliterative bronch￾iolitis is poorly understood, but it is increasingly recognised to
represent immunological and non-immunological mechan￾isms and an aberrant response to injury.1 2
Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been implicated as a
possible cause of non-immunological allograft injury.3
Allograft recipients have a number of risk factors for GOR.
Lung allograft surgery causes significant damage to vagal
innervation of the gastrointestinal tract and the immuno￾suppressant drugs cyclosporin and tacrolimus reduce gastric
motility.4 In addition, cough reflexes and mucociliary
clearance, the normal defence mechanisms against aspira￾tion, are attenuated.5 All the above make reflux more likely,
which is why many allograft recipients are given prophylactic
acid suppression treatment.
Despite a high clinical suspicion regarding GOR in lung
allografts, the literature is small and largely retrospective.
However, formal oesophageal pH studies, when carried out,
do indicate that GOR may be a significant problem in lung
allografts and fundoplication surgery is associated with
improved allograft function.6
We are unaware of any literature to date indicating gastric
aspiration into the lung, and we have therefore tested the
hypothesis that pepsin—as a marker of aspiration—is
detectable in the lungs of allograft recipients who do not
present with obvious symptoms of GOR.
METHODS
The study was approved by the local research ethics
committees for Newcastle and North Tyneside, with separate
applications for prospective studies in lung allografts and
normal volunteer controls.
Following informed consent, 13 chronologically sequential
unselected subjects undergoing either routine or symptom
driven transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) were recruited (table 1), with the research
sample intercalated within this procedure. Research samples
were taken at least 1 month after any preceding broncho￾scopic procedure and in the absence of any clinical evidence
of prior microaspiration. All patients were receiving a
standard long term maintenance regimen of immunosup￾pressive therapy comprising cyclosporin, azathioprine and
prednisolone. The patients were not formally investigated for
GOR, but did not report symptoms suggestive of GOR. In
particular, there were no reports of heartburn, stomach ache,
sour taste in the mouth, or pain on swallowing. Ten patients
were treated with a prophylactic proton pump inhibitor,
which is a common empirical treatment in this patient
population.
Four normal non-smoking controls (one woman, median
age 39, range 32–46) were recruited from volunteer hospital
staff for a research BAL. These subjects were recruited
9 months after the transplant patients, as soon as full ethical
approval had been gained for bronchoscopic investigations in
normal volunteers.
Bronchoscopy, BAL, and TBB
Bronchoscopy was carried out in accordance with published
guidelines.7 Subjects were premedicated with intravenous
midazolam. 4% lignocaine was applied topically to the nose,
pharynx, and larynx and below the cords in 1 ml aliquots, as
required, up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/kg body weight.

Bronchoscopy was carried out with patients in a semi￾reclined position.
Bronchoalveolar lavage was standardised to a 3660 ml
procedure with oxygen saturation routinely measured during
the procedure. The BAL fluid sample was split and assessed
for clinical microbiology and differential cell counts on
Giemsa stained cytocentrifuge preparations. Cell free BAL
supernatants were prepared by centrifugation (10 minutes,
1500 rpm, 10 minutes), aliquots snap frozen by immersion in
liquid N2, and stored at 280˚C prior to ELISA.
Transbronchial biopsies were obtained from allograft
patients only.
Pepsin/pepsinogen ELISA
A locally developed ELISA was performed using 100 ml of
unconcentrated BAL supernatants. The assay, based on a
monospecific antibody to porcine pepsin, measured both
pepsin and total pepsinogens, referred to henceforth as
‘‘pepsin’’, with a lower limit of detection of ,1 ng/ml.8 9 All
assays were performed by one individual and the coefficient
of variation for the assay was 13%. Serum reference levels
for pepsin are 49.8–86.6 mg/l).8 The ELISA on the samples
from normal subjects were performed 9 months after the
transplant patients.
Processing of TBB samples
Five to seven TBB samples were taken at each allograft
bronchoscopy, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin,
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin to assess acute or
chronic rejection according to standard criteria.10
Statistical analysis
Non-parametric methods were used throughout using
Minitab statistical software. The median pepsin levels in
allograft recipients were compared with those in control
subjects by the Mann-Whitney U test (two tailed).
RESULTS
Patient demographic data, BAL and pathological rejection
assessments are summarised in table 1. Five of the 13
subjects had clinically significant mild to moderate (a2) acute
rejection, but all were free from long term irreversible loss of
lung function.
BAL fluid data
The median BAL return was 90 ml (range 55–100) in
allograft recipients and 80 ml (range 55–90) in controls,
indicating technically satisfactory procedures. As in our
previously published data on allograft patients, the percen￾tage of neutrophils in the BAL fluid of allograft recipients was
variable (median 2.0% (range 0.2–35.6)) and higher than our
normal range (1.6% (range 0–2), p = 0.03).11
BAL fluid pepsin levels
Pepsin levels were measurable in all BAL fluid samples from
allograft recipients (fig 1), suggesting gastric aspiration
(median 109 ng/ml (range 35–1375)). In the control group
pepsin levels were below the limit of detection (,1 ng/ml).
Treatment with a maintenance dose of proton pump inhibitor
did not correlate with pepsin levels. There were no correla￾tions between BAL neutrophils, acute rejection, and pepsin
levels.
DISCUSSION
Limited previous reports, largely retrospective but some with
formal objective oesophageal pH monitoring, have suggested
that GOR is a significant problem in lung allograft recipients,6
and treatment of GOR has been cited as a new therapeutic
option to treat patients with the bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome.12
In this study we have shown that high and variable levels
of pepsin are detectable in BAL fluid of allograft recipients,
with no pepsin detected in normal control BAL fluid samples.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic direct evidence
of gastric aspiration into lung allografts. This may be a
continuing and cumulative potential injury to allografts, and
we provide mechanistic support for this contention.
Absolute determination of the dilution of the pericellular
epithelial lining fluid (ELF) sampled by BAL is not possible,13
but estimations are practicable, based on the morphometric
data of Weibel (cited by Widdicombe14). These considerations
suggest that our BAL procedure represents a dilution of

approximately 1 in 200 of the ELF sampled, with our present
data consistent with ELF concentrations of pepsin 10–103
times higher than serum reference levels.8 In contrast, our
published data on BAL fluid levels of albumin in allografts
are consistent with ELF levels substantially lower than those
found in serum.15 Overall, our data indicate a gastric source of
the pepsin detected.
Pepsin is a proteolytic enzyme, active at acidic pH. There
are no data of which we are aware regarding the pH of
allograft ELF, but acidic breath condensate is increasingly
reported as a marker of inflammation in asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis,
and following cardiothoracic surgery.16 These pH levels are
consistent with potential proteolytic activity for pepsin.
Aspiration of gastric contents into the lung would be
anticipated to cause epithelial damage in allografts, stimula￾tion of cytokine production, and an airway inflammatory/
remodelling response, potentially contributing to irreversible
loss of allograft function and eventual failure.1 2
It was noteworthy that most of the patients we studied
were being treated with a prophylactic proton pump inhibitor
at a low maintenance dose. This reflects widespread empirical
use in allograft recipients in view of concurrent oral
corticosteroid use and their role in patients with cystic
fibrosis to prevent pancreatic enzyme supplement degrada￾tion. Such medication would be expected to suppress
symptoms associated with GOR caused by acid, but a
potential concern highlighted by our study is that ‘‘clinically
occult’’ aspiration of other gastric contents would still be
possible.
Our study, though novel, is preliminary and our control
information is limited. However, we specifically adopted a
rigorous approach to this by recruiting normal volunteers,
and no pepsin was detected in these controls. Our results
therefore indicate the presence of unexpectedly high,
potentially deleterious levels of pepsin in lung allografts.
This may be significant, irrespective of aetiology, with lung
allografts singularly vulnerable to injury.1 2 Longitudinal
studies are now required to assess whether the presence of
BAL pepsin and other markers of GOR are related to long
term allograft failure and chronic rejection, and such
techniques may be broadly useful in studying other patients
with GOR who develop lung disease.
