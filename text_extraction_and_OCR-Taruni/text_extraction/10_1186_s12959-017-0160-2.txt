Abstract
Background: Traditional coagulation tests are included in emergency guidelines for management of patients on
direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) who experience acute bleeding or require surgery. We determined the ability
of traditional coagulation tests and fast whole blood thromboelastography (ROTEM®) to screen for anticoagulation
activity of dabigatran and rivaroxaban as low as 30 ng/mL.
Methods: One hundred eighty-four citrated blood samples (75 dabigatran, 109 rivaroxaban) were collected from
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), to perform screening tests from different manufacturers, (diluted, D)
PT, aPTT, TT and ROTEM®. The activity of DOACs was quantitatively determined by clot detection assays: Hemoclot DTT
and DiXaI test (Biophen), on CS2100 (Siemens). The clotting time (CT) of INTEM and EXTEM ROTEM® (Werfen) were
used as test parameters.
Results: Dabigatran, ≥ 30 ng/mL, was accurately detected by five coagulation tests: APTT Actin FSL (93%), PT
Neoplastin (93%), APTT Cephascreen, Thromboclotin, and Thrombin (all 100%), but not by PT Innovin (49%).
CT-EXTEM (91%) was sufficiently sensitive, but not CT-INTEM (52%). APTT Cephascreen and Thrombin showed
good linearity (R2 = 0.71,R2 = 0.72). For the other tests linearity was moderate to poor. Rivaroxaban was
accurately detected by PT Neoplastin (98%) and less so by APTT Cephascreen (85%). In addition, rivaroxaban
was also accurately detected by CT-INTEM (96%). PT Neoplastin showed good linearity (R2 = 0.81), all other
tests had moderate to poor linearity.
Conclusion: In patients with NVAF, the ability of routine coagulation tests to detect the presence of significant levels
of DOACs is test and reagent dependent. CT-INTEM and CT-EXTEM may be fast whole blood alternatives.
Trial registration: The Institutional Review Board of the MUMC approved this study (December 2011, project
number 114069).

Background
For more than 60 years vitamin K antagonists (VKA)
were the drugs of choice to prevent thrombosis in
patients with NVAF and mechanical heart valves, as well
as to treat and prevent recurrence of thrombosis in pa￾tients with venous thromboembolism (VTE).
The management of patients on anticoagulant therapy
was guided by laboratory testing of prothrombin time
(PT), which was internationally harmonized by the ISI
factor resulting in (international normalized ratio) INR,
an easily interpretable laboratory test [1]. With the
introduction of direct oral anticoagulants it was empha￾sized that no routine laboratory testing would be needed
[2–7]. However, in emergency situations the need for
testing remains since residual activity of the anticoagu￾lant treatment might introduce e.g. bleeding during sur￾gery. Screening tests for detecting anticoagulants, which
can be performed 24 h a day instead of just during work￾ing hours should therefore be available to guide treat￾ment decisions. The concentration below 30 ng/mL is
proposed as a safe-for surgical treatment threshold [8].
Thereby, this concentration is sufficient to administer
antidote against DOAC if needed [9].
Activity-based drug levels in plasma can be determined
but are not obtainable in all care settings [10]. Traditional
routine coagulation tests are widely available and may be
used for first line testing in emergency situations [11–15].
In many countries regional guidelines have been issued
upon the introduction of the DOACs indicating the pre￾ferred strategies of action for both the prescription and
(laboratory) management of these drugs [16–18]. These
guidelines do indicate that the thrombin time (TT) is the
most sensitive routine coagulation assay for detection of
dabigatran and that the PT is the most sensitive routine
coagulation assay for detection of rivaroxaban. Guidelines
do however not (sufficiently) report on the sensitivity of
the different individual TT, PT and activated partial
thromboplastin Time (aPTT) tests that are commercially
available. This may be due to the fact that most of these
guidelines were based on laboratory data using plasma
spiked with DOAC instead of samples acquired from pa￾tients using the drugs.
We therefore set out to evaluate two proposed screening
algorithms [16, 18] and at the same time validate seven dif￾ferent routine anticoagulation tests for screening of plasma
drug activity in daily practice, using plasma samples from
a cohort of patients on dabigatran and rivaroxaban. In
addition we evaluated ROTEM® for the same purpose in
whole blood in a subsample of the study population [19].
Methods
Patients
This analysis comprises the first 76 non-valvular Atrial
Fibrillation (NVAF) patients (30 on dabigatran, 46 on
rivaroxaban) that were structurally followed in an
observational DOAC study in the Maastricht University
Medical Center (MUMC+), the Netherlands. The study
is ongoing.
Study population
All patients came from a single institution, the anticoa￾gulation clinic Maastricht, and were referred by cardiol￾ogists of the MUMC. Patients were followed in an
observational cohort study, which started January 2012
and is still ongoing. The Institutional Review Board of
the MUMC approved the study (December 2011, project
number 114069). All patients enrolled in the follow-up
signed informed consent. All consecutive patients with
NVAF and a CHADS2 score ≥ 2 who were initiated on a
DOAC were eligible for inclusion in the study.
Study design
This laboratory study is part of a prospective observa￾tional cohort study. Patients were invited to a special
structured nurse-based office visit at the anticoagulation
clinic. All patients were followed for 1 year, during
which 5 visits were planned (at start of DOAC therapy,
1 month after start DOAC, 3 months, 6 months and
12 months). Important parameters recorded during
these visits were: thrombotic events and bleeding com￾plications, side effects of medication, compliance to
medication, intermittent illness and/or hospital admis￾sions and renal function. Renal function was assessed at
4 points in time; additional blood for testing of a panel
of laboratory tests was drawn. The panel of laboratory
tests consisted of: APTT Actin FSL (Siemens), APTT
Cephascreen (Stago), PT Innovin (Siemens), PT neoplas￾tin (Stago), Diluted PT (DPT) Innovin (Siemens), TT
Thromboclotin (Siemens), TT Thrombin (Stago), CT
INTEM (ROTEM®), and CT EXTEM (ROTEM®,
Werfen). Diluted TT Hemoclot (Biophen) was set as
gold standard for the detection of dabigatran and anti
Xa activity DiXal (Biophen) for the detection of rivaroxa￾ban. For this paper clinical details are not presented be￾cause the blood samples were purely used for laboratory
validation.
Blood sampling and laboratory measurements
Blood was taken by antecubital venipuncture and
collected into 3,2% citrated vacutainer® tubes using a 21
gauche eclipse signal blood collection needle (BD vacu￾tainer®), sampling was standardized and timed between 9
and 11 a.m.
Plasma was obtained after centrifugation for 10 min at
2000 g at room temperature. Plasma samples were
frozen at −80 °C and thawed in a standard procedure be￾fore coagulation testing. PT and DPT Innovin, APTT
Actin FSL, TT Thromboclotin and diluted TT Hemoclot
Henskens et al. Thrombosis Journal (2018) 16:3 Page 2 of 7

as well as Anti-Xa activity were performed on a CS2100
analyzer (Siemens). PT Neoplastin, APTT Cephascreen,
TT Thrombin were performed on a STA-R analyzer
(Stago), Whole blood was used for ROTEM® analyses.
Table 1 summarizes the different methods. The cut-off
for a clinical relevant detection limit was set at ≥30 ng/mL
for both rivaroxaban and dabigatran as determined as
anticoagulation activity by the diluted TT Hemoclot and
DiXaI test (both Biophen) on CS2100 using dabigatran
and rivaroxaban as calibrators.
Statistics
The statistical package of Graph Pad® (version 6) was
used for statistical analysis. Correlations were analyzed
by linear regression analysis and slope, intercept and R2
were determined and presented. For the sensitivity the
cut-off for detection for all routine laboratory tests was
set at 30 ng/mL for both dabigatran and rivaroxaban.
Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a diag￾nostic test evaluation calculator (MedCalc®).
Results
In total 184 citrated blood samples (75 dabigatran samples
and 109 rivaroxaban samples) were collected. Dabigatran ac￾tivity in a steady state situation, determined by diluted TT
Hemoclot varied considerably between patients: Mean geometric
104 (± 53) ng/mL. Rivaroxaban activity determined by DiXaI
test showed similar variability, mean geometric 187 (± 139) ng/
mL. Clinical relevant dabigatran activity (≥ 30 ng/mL) was
detected accurately by both thrombin time assays: TT
Thromboclotin (100%), and TT Thrombin (100%). In
addition good sensitivity was reached for four other coagula￾tion tests in the panel: APTT Actin FSL (93%), APTT
Cephascreen (100%), PT Neoplastin (93%), but not for PT
Innovin (49%). Also CT-EXTEM of ROTEM® (91%) was suf￾ficiently sensitive, but not CT-INTEM (52%). (Table 2).
APTT Cephascreen and TT Thrombin showed good
linearity (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.72). For the other tests
linearity was moderate to poor (APTT Actin FSL
(R2 = 0.59), PT Neoplastin (R2 = 0.19), Thromboclotin
(R2 = 0.18), and PT Innovin (R2 = 0.09). All correla￾tions were highly significant (all <0.0001 and 0.0046
for PT Innovin; Fig. 1, Fig. 3).
Rivaroxaban activity was only accurately detected by two
tests in the panel (PT Neoplastin (98%), and less so by
APTT Cephascreen (85%). In addition Rivaroxaban activity
was also accurately detected by CT intem of ROTEM®
(96%). PT Innovin was not sufficiently sensitive (68%). PT
Neoplastin showed good linearity across concentrations
(R2 = 0.81). All other tests had moderate to poor linearity;
APTT Cephascreen (R2 = 0.55), APTT Actin FSL (R2 =
0.53), and ROTEM® CT-EXTEM (R2 = 0.58). All correla￾tions were significant (<0.0001). (Fig. 2, Fig. 3).
Discussion
The main findings of the present study are that in pa￾tients with NVAF, the ability of routine coagulation tests
to detect the presence of significant levels of dabigatran
or rivaroxaban is test and reagent dependent. Therefore,

emergency care protocols should ensure that local test
reagents are sufficiently accurate for detecting the pres￾ence of DOACs. Otherwise, the CT-INTEM and CT￾EXTEM of ROTEM® may be good and fast whole blood
alternatives that may be readily available on site.
In emergency situations it is crucial that routine coagu￾lation tests are clinically validated and that the test sensi￾tivity for the detection of minimal and clinically important
levels of anticoagulation is known. In patients with serious
bleeding or requiring urgent intervention with bleeding
risk, a drug concentration > 30 ng/mL is proposed as clin￾ical relevant and sufficient to administer antidote against
DOAC [9]. Emergency coagulation testing according to
suggested algorithms is usually dependent on whether
knowledge of the actual intake and the timing of ingestion
of DOAC is available or not. If the DOAC taken by the pa￾tient is indeed known, one may choose the most appropri￾ate test for the drug: for dabigatran the most appropriate
screening test is stated to be the TT15. If the TT is not
prolonged, the presence of dabigatran can be completely
excluded. The PT is the most appropriate screening test
for rivaroxaban; for most PT reagents a normal PT im￾plies that clinical relevant concentrations of rivaroxa￾ban can be excluded [15]. According to current

guidelines, a panel of conventional coagulation tests
(aPTT, PT and TT) should be used in case of intake
of an unknown DOAC, to thereby exclude relevant
drug levels for either dabigatran or rivaroxaban. In
addition, for other DOACs such as apixaban or edoxaban,
calibrated drug specific anti-Xa levels still need to be mea￾sured; screening tests are not yet available [20, 21].
However, whether the suggested algorithms are actu￾ally feasible in real life situations has not been tested yet.
APTT, PT and TT are both widely and rapidly available
in emergency situations, but one should be careful with
the interpretation of these tests [22–25]. One needs to
realize that these standard coagulation tests with low
screening sensitivity might lead to a false reassurance
when indicating absent drug levels. In our cohort both
TT tests were able to pick up clinically relevant levels of
dabigatran (≥30 ng/mL). In case of rivaroxaban however,
there was a marked difference in sensitivity between the
two PT tests used: PT neoplastin had a sensitivity of
97.5%, PT Innovin expressed a much lower sensitivity of
only 67.7%. This may result in a underestimation of drug
levels in more than 32% of patients in case PT Innovin
is used for screening for active drug levels, while this is
much less for PT Neoplastin (<3%). As can be appreci￾ated from the data, most of the before mentioned tests
are only useful as in- or exclusion tests (Yes, No). It

would be a great advantage if also actual drug levels
could be predicted form the result of a test in an emer￾gency situation. Therefore, the correlations between
drug levels and the panel of routine coagulation tests
were also assessed. For dabigatran APTT Cephascreen
and Thrombin were both sensitive and accurate. For riv￾aroxaban only PT Neoplastin was both sensitive and
level predictive. Moreover, rapid measurement of DOAC
plasma concentration levels have become available and
might therefore also feasible for use in emergency situa￾tions [26]. Their role in the algorithms should be evalu￾ated in the near future. For all laboratory tests applies
that handling of samples by laboratory technicians is
mandatory. This is time consuming and may impact
swift and adequate interventions in an emergency set￾ting. A point of care test for which whole blood can be
used would improve the decision making process.
The CT-EXTEM showed good sensitivity for both
rivaroxaban and dabigatran, its linearity is however mod￾erate. Our results differ from previous studies where
ROTEM® was able to show a dose dependent increase in
DOAC levels in spiked whole blood samples, but poorly
performed at low DOAC levels [27]. Our study showed
that the ‘real life’ sensitivity of ROTEM® is better in
patients using DOAC and might therefore be a good can￾didate for emergency testing. The added advantage of
ROTEM® testing is that the results are readily available (<
5 min) and there is uniform performance with worldwide
standardization. ROTEM® can be used by emergency
personnel or as point of care testing in operating theaters,
but also with standard situations in most hospitals labora￾tories. ROTEM® testing may in addition also offer the pos￾sibility of monitoring the use of antidotes.
Our study has some weaknesses: we included a relatively
small number of patients and the DOACs used were lim￾ited to dabigatran and rivaroxaban, as patients in our co￾hort did not use apixaban or edoxaban. We furthermore
did not use the accepted gold standard test, liquid chro￾matography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for quanti￾fication of DOACs [28] although the selected coagulation
activity assays correlated well with LC-MS techniques.
Strengths of our study are 1) that real life samples to
assess the feasibility of current guidelines on DOAC test￾ing and 2) an extensive panel of 7 different anticoagula￾tion tests in addition to ROTEM® testing was used.
Conclusion
We conclude that guideline proposed screening algo￾rithms are feasible in a real life steady state NVAF
population. However, the ability of routine coagula￾tion tests to detect the presence of significant levels
of dabigatran or rivaroxaban is extremely test and re￾agent dependent.
Emergency care protocols should ensure that local test
reagents are sufficiently accurate for detecting the presence
of DOACs. CT-INTEM and CT-EXTEM of ROTEM® can
be considered as effective whole blood alternatives that
have the advantage to be readily available on site.
