Abstract
Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is an intracellular protozoan parasite and the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a chronic
infectious illness that affects millions of people worldwide. Although the role of TLR and Nod1 in the control of T. cruzi
infection is well-established, the involvement of inflammasomes remains to be elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate for the
first time that T. cruzi infection induces IL-1b production in an NLRP3- and caspase-1-dependent manner. Cathepsin B
appears to be required for NLRP3 activation in response to infection with T. cruzi, as pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin
B abrogates IL-1b secretion. NLRP32/2 and caspase12/2 mice exhibited high numbers of T. cruzi parasites, with a magnitude
of peak parasitemia comparable to MyD882/2 and iNOS2/2 mice (which are susceptible models for T. cruzi infection),
indicating the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the control of the acute phase of T. cruzi infection. Although the
inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-c were found in spleen cells from NLRP32/2 and caspase12/2 mice infected with T.
cruzi, these mice exhibited severe defects in nitric oxide (NO) production and an impairment in macrophage-mediated
parasite killing. Interestingly, neutralization of IL-1b and IL-18, and IL-1R genetic deficiency demonstrate that these cytokines
have a minor effect on NO secretion and the capacity of macrophages to control T. cruzi infection. In contrast, inhibition of
caspase-1 with z-YVAD-fmk abrogated NO production by WT and MyD882/2 macrophages and rendered them as
susceptible to T. cruzi infection as NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 macrophages. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role
for the NLRP3 inflammasome in the control of T. cruzi infection and identify NLRP3-mediated, caspase-1-dependent and IL￾1R-independent NO production as a novel effector mechanism for these innate receptors.

Introduction
Trypanosoma cruzi is an intracellular trypanosomatid protozoan
that is transmitted to the human host by blood-feeding Reduviidae
bugs from the subfamily Triatominae. T. cruzi is the causative
agent of Chagas disease and American trypanosomiasis, a chronic
infectious disease. While Chagas disease is endemic in Latin
America, a significant increase in confirmed cases of Chagas
disease has recently been reported in the USA, Canada, Japan,
Australia and Europe, indicating that it is an emerging disease [1]
[2] [3]. Due to increasing immigration from endemic countries
and a lack of regular screening in blood banks and hospitals (with a
few exceptions), T. cruzi infection is a potential public health issue
in the USA and Europe.
The control of T. cruzi by the immune system depends on both
innate and adaptive responses. Innate immune cells are respon￾sible for the initial recognition of the parasite, as well as the
initiation and coordination of adaptive responses [4]. The
transmembrane Toll-like Receptor (TLR) family of pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) plays a central role in the recognition
of T. cruzi by the immune system [5]. TLR4 [6], TLR2 [7] [8] [9],
TLR9 [10] and TLR7 [11] are responsible for sensing
glycoinositolphospholipid-containing ceramides (GIPLs), glycosyl￾phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors from the trypomastigote form
of the parasite (t-GPI mucin), T. cruzi DNA and T. cruzi RNA,
respectively. These receptors initiate a signaling cascade that is
dependent on the adaptor molecule MyD88 and culminates in the
activation of pro-inflammatory genes that are crucial for resistance
to T. cruzi infection, including IL-12 [12] [13] [14] [15], IFN-c
[16] and the microbicidal molecule nitric oxide (NO) [17] [18].
MyD882/2 mice are highly susceptible to T. cruzi infection,
possibly because of defects in the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines [19]. In addition to TLR, NOD1, a member of the
cytosolic NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, plays a role in
controlling T. cruzi infection [20]. NOD12/2 macrophages exhibit
impaired production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO, and
NOD12/2 mice succumb to the acute phase of T. cruzi infection.
Despite evidence for the critical role of NOD1 in controlling T.
cruzi, the agonist responsible for NOD1 activation remains
unknown.
In addition to NOD1 and NOD2, the cytosolic PRR family
includes inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes that
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e2469

contain a sensor protein from the NLR or pyrin and HIN
domain-containing protein (PYHIN) families. The signaling
cascade initiated by inflammasomes includes the recruitment of
the apoptosis-associated speck-like (ASC) protein (which con￾tains a caspase activating and recruitment domain (CARD) and
pro-caspase-1 or pro-caspase-11 (pro-caspase-4 in humans),
culminating in the activation of these proteases (reviewed in [21]
[22] [23]). Active caspase-1 mediates the maturation and
secretion of the IL-1b and IL-18 pro-inflammatory cytokines
and, along with caspase-11, induces the pyroptosis cell death
program.
NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 are the best-characterized
inflammasome complexes. NLRC4 is activated in response to
bacterial proteins such as flagellin [24] or the inner rod
component of the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)
[25], whereas AIM2 senses cytosolic bacterial [26] and viral
DNA [27]. NLRP3 is activated by several different classes of
molecules, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) from viruses [28], bacteria [29] [30] [31], fungi [32]
and protozoa [33]; signals from endogenous damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPS) such as uric acid and ATP [34]
[35]; and crystalline or particulate structures such as alum [36]
[37] and silica [38]. NLRP3 activation by these molecules,
which are not structurally related, appears to be influenced by
ROS production, lysosomal rupture or potassium efflux, which
are believed to result in distinct activation signals [39] [40]
[41].
Inflammasomes have been implicated in the host response to
several pathogens. NLRP3 has been identified as an effector in the
control of Mycobacterium [42], Cytrobacterium [43], Salmonella [44],
Brucella [45], Influenza A virus [46] [47] [48], Candida [32] and
other pathogens. However, the in vivo role of the NLRP3
inflammasome in the host defense against T. cruzi has not been
elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome
controls T. cruzi parasitemia by inducing NO production via a
caspase-1-dependent, IL-1R-independent pathway.
Methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the Brazilian National Council of Animal
Experimentation (http://www.cobea.org.br/). The protocol was
approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
Federal University of Sao Paulo (Id # CEP 0162/11).
Animals
C57BL/6 wild type (WT), caspase-12/2, NLRP32/2,
MyD882/2, IL-1R2/2, iNOS2/2 and IFN-c2/2 mice were bred
in our animal facilities at the Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo. The
caspase-12/2 mice were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Flavell
(Yale University, USA), and the NLRP32/2 mice were kindly
provided by Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech, USA). Eight-week￾old female mice were infected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 103
blood-derived trypomastigotes from the Y strain of T. cruzi,
which was obtained from the Dante Pazzanese Institute.
Parasitemia was monitored by counting the number of
bloodstream trypomastigotes in 5 mL of fresh blood collected
from the tail vein. Spleens were removed 10 days after infection.
All animal procedures were developed with all efforts to
minimize suffering and were approved by the Ethics Committee
for Animal Care of the Federal University of Sa˜o Paulo
UNIFESP (Id # CEP 0162/11).
Preparation of mouse macrophages
Peritoneal macrophages (PMs) were obtained by peritoneal
lavage 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of a 1% starch solution
(Sigma Aldrich). Peritoneal cells were cultured overnight in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated FCS and
antibiotics. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with
warm RPMI medium.
In vitro infection with T. cruzi
PMs (1,56106 cells/300 ml) cultured in RPMI medium were
infected with trypomastigotes from T. cruzi strain Y (3 parasites/
cell) purified from a monkey epithelial cells (LLCMK2). The
cells were treated with a caspase-1 inhibitor (z-YVAD-fmk)
(10 mM) (MBL International Corporation), an iNOS inhibitor
(1 mM) (Aminoguanidin, AG), a cathepsin B inhibitor (Ca-074-
Me) (Sigma Aldrich), a K+ channel inhibitor (Glybenclamide,
GLB) (InVivogen), an ROS inhibitor (Apocynin, APO) (25 mM
to 100 mM) (Sigma Aldrich) or neutralizing antibodies against
IL-1b and IL-18 (0,1, 1 and 10 ng/mL) (BD Pharmingen).
Supernatants were collected 24 h after infection to detect IL-1b,
IFN-c and IL-6, and 48 h after infection to measure the NO
concentration.
Microbicidal activity of macrophages
PMs (36105
) from C57BL/6 wild type (WT), caspase-12/2,
NLRP32/2, MyD882/2, iNOS2/2 and IL-1R2/2, mice were
infected with trypomastigotes from T. cruzi Y (1:5) for 2–4 h.
Extracellular parasites were removed by washing, and after
48 hours the chambers were fixed with methanol and stained
with DAPI (49, 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma Aldrich). The
frequency of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes
inside the macrophages were evaluated by fluorescence microsco￾py (6006). At least 500 macrophages were counted for each
representative experiment.
Author Summary
Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate receptors that are
emerging as central effectors in the control of infections
and inflammatory pathologies. NLRP3 is the most studied
member of inflammasomes with established role in the
control of bacterial and viral infections. This manuscript
describes original studies on the involvement of NLRP3
inflammasome in the control of Trypanosoma cruzi, the
etiological agent of Chagas disease, a chronic infectious
illness that affects millions of people in the world. T. cruzi
activates NLRP3 inflammasome by a mechanism involving
cathepsin B. NLRP32/2 and caspase12/2 mice display high
parasitemia during acute phase of T. cruzi infection, which
could be explained by a severe defect in the production of
nitric oxide (NO) and in the impairment of their macro￾phages to control intracellular parasites. Interestingly,
inhibition of caspase-1, but not the neutralization of IL￾1b and IL-18, the best-studied caspase-1 substrates,
abrogated NO production by WT and MyD882/2 macro￾phages and rendered them as susceptible to T. cruzi
infection as NLRP32/2 macrophages. Together, our results
indicate a caspase-1-dependent and IL-1b and IL-18-
independent pathway for NO production as a new effector
mechanism played by NLRP3 to control T. cruzi infection.

Measurement of cytokines and NO
Supernatants from in vitro-infected PMs (1,56106 cells/300 ml)
or cultured spleen cells from infected mice (36106 cells/300 ml)
were collected after 24 h. IL-1b and IL-6 were measured using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits from BD
Pharmingen (OptEIA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. The levels of IL-1b were determined using a standard curve
generated with the 17 KDa mature form of recombinant mouse
IL-1b, as previously described [49]. IFN-c was detected by
sandwich ELISA using a purified anti-IFN-c capture antibody (BD
Pharmingen) and a biotin rat anti-mouse IFN-c antibody (BD
Pharmingen). IFN-c levels were calculated based on a standard
curve generated using recombinant cytokine (BD Pharmingen).
The nitrite concentration was determined by the Griess reaction.
Briefly, 50 ml of Griess reagent solution (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1%
naphthylene diamine dihydrochloride, 2% H3PO4) was added to
50 ml samples, and the absorbances were measured at 540 nm.
Statistical analysis
Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and at
least three independent experiments were performed. Data are
presented as the mean 6 S.D. Statistical analysis of the data was
carried out using one-way or two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post￾test. Differences between the experimental groups were considered
significant as follows: p,0.05 (*), p,0.01 (**) and p,0,001(***).
Results
T. cruzi-induced NLRP3 activation is dependent on
cathepsin B
The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by a variety of stimuli,
including viral, bacterial, fungal and protozoan pathogens.
However, the activation of NLRP3 by T. cruzi has not been
previously reported. To determine the ability of T. cruzi to activate
NLRP3, we evaluated the secretion of IL-1b by T. cruzi-infected
peritoneal macrophages (PMs). T. cruzi infection induced the
secretion of IL-1b by PMs isolated from WT mice, but not from
PMs isolated from NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice (Figure 1A).
Lysosomal cathepsins, ROS and/or potassium efflux have been
reported to influence NLRP3 activation in response to diverse
stimuli [35] [36] [37]. To investigate the role of these molecules in
T. cruzi-induced NLRP3 activation, PMs from WT mice were
infected with T. cruzi in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors
of cathepsin B (Ca-074ME), NADPH oxidase (apocynin, APO)
and potassium channels (glybenclamide, GLB). IL-1b secretion by
infected macrophages was inhibited by Ca-074ME in a dose￾dependent manner, but was not inhibited by APO or GLB
(Figure 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that T. cruzi is
able to induce NLRP3 activation by a mechanism that involves
cathepsin B.
NLRP3- and caspase-1-deficient mice exhibit high levels
of parasitemia and are defective in NO secretion during
the acute phase of T. cruzi infection
Next, we evaluated the role of NLRP3 in host resistance to T.
cruzi infection by assessing parasitemia and mortality in NLRP32/2
and caspase-12/2 mice infected with T. cruzi Y. A significantly
greater number of T. cruzi parasites were found in the blood of both
NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice compared to WT mice
(Figure 2A). Interestingly, the degree of parasitemia exhibited by
the NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice was comparable to that
exhibited by the MyD882/2 and iNOS2/2 mice, which are
considered susceptible models for T. cruzi infection [18] [19]
(Figure 2A and Table S1). The greatest parasite burden was found
in IFN-c2/2 mice (Figure 2A and Table S1). To evaluate the pro￾inflammatory responses of NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice
during the acute phase of T. cruzi infection, we assessed the level of
cytokines and NO in the supernatants of cultured spleen cells
isolated 10 days after infection. MyD882/2 mice were used as a
positive control for susceptibility to infection. Unlike MyD882/2
spleen cells, the spleen cells isolated from NLRP32/2 and caspase￾12/2 mice produced considerable levels of IL-6 (Figure 2B) and
IFN-c (Figure 2C), although they did not produce as much IFN-c as
the WT cells. As expected, IL-1b was produced by splenocytes
isolated from WT mice, but not by splenocytes isolated from
NLRP32/2, caspase-12/2 and MyD882/2 mice (Figure 2D). In
agreement with a previous report [19], the production of NO by
spleen cells from infected MyD882/2 mice was significantly
reduced compared to spleen cells isolated from WT mice
(Figure 2E). Surprisingly, however, the levels of NO produced by
splenocytes from NLRP32/2 and especially caspase-12/2 mice
were even lower than the levels of NO produced by splenocytes
Figure 1. T. cruzi-induced NLRP3 activation. PMs from WT,
NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice (1,56106 cells/300 ml) were infected
with T. cruzi Y trypomastigotes (3 parasites per cell). The supernatants

doses of 25, 50 and 100 mM, or left untreated (-). After 24 h, the
supernatants were collected and IL-1b production was evaluated by
ELISA. Bars represent the mean 6 S.D. of triplicate samples, where

isolated from MyD882/2 mice (Figure 2E). The defect in NO
production by spleen cells isolated from the NLRP32/2 and
caspase-12/2 mice could explain the high levels of parasitemia
observed in the iNOS2/2, NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice
(Figure 2A). However, unlike the MyD882/2 and IFN-c2/2 mice,
which succumbed to infection, the NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2
mice survived infection (Figure 2F). These data suggest that NLRP3
and caspase-1 are required for NO production and parasite control
during the acute phase of T. cruzi infection.
NLRP3-dependent NO secretion is critical for T. cruzi
killing by macrophages
Because macrophages are the major source of NO during T.
cruzi infection, the deficiency in NO production exhibited by the
caspase-12/2 and NLRP32/2 mice could reflect an impairment
in macrophage function. To test this hypothesis, PMs from WT,
MyD882/2, NLRP32/2, and caspase-12/2 mice were infected in
vitro with T. cruzi trypomastigotes. After 48 hs, the DAPI-stained
slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The NLRP32/2
and caspase-12/2 macrophages demonstrated a marked deficien￾cy in the control of infection, as the number of amastigotes
(Figure 3A) and the frequency of infected cells (Figure 3B) were
even higher than in the susceptible MyD882/2 macrophages.
Notably, the difference in the amastigotes numbers of the
macrophages derived from the knockouts and the WT mice was
not related to the invasion rate of T. cruzi, as similar numbers of
amastigotes were observed in the macrophages from WT,
NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice after 2 h of infection (Figure
S1A). In contrast, 48 h after infection, the number of amastigotes
present in the WT macrophages only was significantly reduced
(Figure S1A). Therefore, in the absence of NLRP3 and caspase-1,
macrophages were more permissive to parasite replicative or less
efficient to kill them, or both. Importantly, pyroptosis (macrophage
death induced by inflammasome activation) was not observed
during T. cruzi infection. The majority of the T. cruzi-infected
macrophages isolated from WT mice stained with the vital dye
acridine orange and did not incorporate ethidium bromide, in
contrast to macrophages stimulated with cytosolic flagellin, a
potent pyroptotic stimulus [49] (Text S1 and Figure S1B). As
observed in the spleen cells from infected mice (Figure 2), unlike
MyD882/2 macrophages, macrophages isolated from NLRP32/2
and caspase-12/2 mice secreted the pro-inflammatory cytokine
IL-6 (Figure 3C) but did not produce NO (Figure 3D). Further￾more, NLRP3-dependent NO production in response to T. cruzi
infection appeared to be regulated by cathepsin B, as Ca-074ME,
but not APO or GLB, significantly reduced the levels of NO
produced by macrophages from WT mice (Figure 3E). These
results correlate well with our observations of IL-1b production
(Figure 1B). Moreover, treatment with Ca-074ME significantly
increased the frequency of infection in macrophages isolated from
WT and MyD882/2 mice (Figure 3F), as well as the number of
amastigotes found inside these cells (data not shown). In contrast,
Ca-074ME treatment had no effect in PMs from NLRP32/2 and
even resulted in a small increase in levels of infection in PMs from
caspase-12/2 mice (Figure 3F). Taken together, these results
suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome mediates NO production
in response to T. cruzi infection by a mechanism that involves
cathepsin B.
NLRP3-dependent NO secretion in response to T. cruzi
infection is mediated by caspase-1 and does not require
IL-1R
To confirm the role of NLRP3-dependent NO secretion in the
control of T. cruzi infection, macrophages were infected in the
presence of AG, a selective iNOS inhibitor. Treatment with AG
increased the number of intracellular parasites found in WT and
MyD882/2 macrophages by 100% and 25%, respectively
(Figure 4A), indicating that the NO produced by these macro￾phages contributes to the control of T. cruzi infection. Conversely,
no significant effect was observed in NLRP32/2 macrophages
treated with AG (Figure 4A), supporting the idea that NLRP3-
mediated NO secretion is involved in the control of parasite
replication. Because NLRP3 activation leads to caspase-1 activa￾tion and consequent IL-1b secretion, we next asked whether
caspase-1 and IL-1b are required for NLRP3-dependent NO
production in response to T. cruzi infection, and what role these
molecules play in the control of infection by macrophages. In
contrast to the caspase-12/2 macrophages, we observed only a
minor increase in the number of amastigotes in macrophages
isolated from IL-1R2/2 mice compared to macrophages isolated
from WT mice (Figure 4B). These results correlate with the ability
of the IL-1R2/2 macrophages to produce NO (Figure 4C; white
bars). Moreover, in the presence of the caspase-1 inhibitor (z￾YVAD-fmk) or AG, the NO production (Figure 4C) and the
capacity to control of T. cruzi infection (Figure 4D) of the WT and
IL-1R2/2 macrophages were abrogated. Importantly, treatment
with z-YVAD-fmk or AG had no significant effect on NO
production (Figure 4C) and amastigote numbers (Figure 4D) in
macrophages from caspase-12/2 and iNOS2/2 mice. This finding
indicates that caspase-1 plays a major role in the induction of
NLRP3-dependent NO production and the control of T. cruzi
infection by macrophages.
NLRP3-mediated NO production acts synergistically with
MyD88-mediated pathways to control T. cruzi infection
As demonstrated in Figure 3D, MyD882/2 macrophages
secreted NO, although at reduced levels compared to WT
macrophages. Because MyD88 participates in the IL-1R and IL￾18R signaling pathways, these results confirm that NO production
in response to T. cruzi infection is mediated by a signaling pathway
that involves NLRP3/caspase-1 and is independent of IL-1b and
IL-18. In fact, the neutralization of IL-18 or IL-1b plus IL-18
reduced NO production by T. cruzi-infected macrophages from
WT mice by only 15–20% (Figure 5A). Notably, treatment with z￾YVAD-fmk abrogated the secretion of NO by MyD882/2
macrophages (Figure 5B) and rendered them highly susceptible
to T. cruzi replication (Figure 5C). Together, these results suggest
that MyD88 and caspase-1, as well as IL-1b and IL-18 to a lesser
extent, cooperate to clear T. cruzi infection by inducing NO
production.
Figure 2. NLRP3 and caspase-1 are involved in the control of T. cruzi infection. WT, MyD882/2, NLRP32/2, caspase-12/2, IFN-c2/2 and
iNOS2/2 mice were subcutaneously infected with 103 T. cruzi blood trypomastigotes. Parasitemia was quantified by counting the parasites in 5 mL of
tail blood obtained on days 4 to 20 after infection (A). Supernatants from cultured spleen cells (36106 cells/300 ml) isolated from naive (-) or infected
(10 days) mice were collected after 24 h. The levels of IL-6 (B), IFN-c (C) and IL-1b (D) were assessed by ELISA, and NO secretion was assessed by the
Griess reaction (E). Numbers represent the mean 6 S.D. (n = 5). *** p.0,001, ** p.0,01 and * p.0,05 compared to the WT group. Mortality was

MyD882/2, NLRP32/2, caspase-12/2 mice (n = 6) showing similar results.

Discussion
Cells from the innate immune system play a key role in sensing
and controlling the acute phase of T. cruzi infection. While TLR2,
TLR4, TLR7, TLR9 and NOD1 play well-established roles in
host resistance to T. cruzi infection, it is unknown whether
inflammasomes, multiprotein platforms that are emerging as
central regulators in many infections and inflammatory patholo￾gies, are involved. Herein, we show that T. cruzi activates NLRP3
inflammasomes by a mechanism that involves lysosomal cathep￾sins. NLRP3 and the effector protease caspase-1 appear to
participate in controlling the acute phase of T. cruzi infection, as
NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice exhibit a very prominent peak
parasitemia, despite their ability to secrete IL-6 and IFN-c.
However, in the absence of NLRP3 and caspase-1, NO
production is significantly impaired, indicating the involvement
of NLRP3 inflammasomes in inducing NO secretion. The
deficiency in NO secretion reflects in the inability of macrophages
to control intracellular amastigotes. Interestingly, NLRP3-depen￾dent NO secretion is completely abrogated in the absence of
caspase-1, but not in the absence of IL-1R, which could explain
the ability of IL-1R2/2 macrophages, but not caspase-12/2
macrophages, to prevent T. cruzi replication. In fact, macrophages
isolated from MyD882/2 mice, which are unable to respond to
TLRs agonists (except TLR3), IL-1 and IL-18, secrete NO,
although at low levels compared to WT cells. Moreover, the
inhibition of caspase-1 in MyD882/2 macrophages renders them
susceptible to T. cruzi infection as NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2

PAMPs and DAMPs that are not structurally related [39] [40]
[41]. T. cruzi infection induced IL-1b secretion by spleen cells as
well as by macrophages isolated from WT mice, but not by cells
isolated from NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice, which suggests
that T. cruzi activates NLRP3 inflammasomes. Importantly, IL-1b
production was also reduced in MyD882/2 cells, which is
expected since pro-IL-1b is transcriptionally regulated by signals
dependent on TLR [50]. Interestingly, the pharmacological
inhibition of cathepsin B abrogated T. cruzi-induced IL-1b
secretion, suggesting that lysosomal pathways are involved in
NLRP3 activation in response to T. cruzi infection. In fact, T. cruzi
invades a variety of cell types by recruiting lysosomes to the plasma
membrane, which they fuse with to form a steady parasitophorous
vacuole [51]. T. cruzi requires the acidic environment of the
lysosome to exit the parasitophorous vacuole and replicate in cell
cytosol. We suggest that the lysosomes are disrupted by this
process, leading to liberation of cathepsins which then mediate
NLRP3 activation by an as yet unknown mechanism.
NLRP3 inflammasomes appear to control T. cruzi replication
during the acute phase of infection, as NLRP32/2 and caspase￾12/2 mice exhibit a very prominent peak parasitemia 11 d after
infection. While NLRP3 is involved in many inflammatory
disorders, little is known about the role of NLRP3 in controlling
infections. Recently, we demonstrated that NLRP3 and AIM2
inflammasomes are involved in the control of Brucella abortus
infection through an IL-1b- and IL-18-dependent mechanism
[45]. NLRP3-induced IL-1b secretion also mediates host resis￾tance to C. rodentium, [43], M. kansasii [42], S. typhimurium [44],
Influenza A virus [46] and C. albicans [32] [52]. However, NLRP3
does not appear to play a role in the control of the protozoan
parasite Plasmodium [33] [53]. Conversely, the absence of NLRP3
or IL-1b resulted in increased survival of the malaria strain P.

chabaudi adami DS, indicating that NLRP3 promotes malaria
pathology. The first demonstration of the involvement of
inflammasomes in the control of a protozoan infection was
recently described in collaboration with our group [54]. In this
article, we demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome is
involved in the control of L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis and L.
infantum chagasi through a mechanism that involves IL-1R￾dependent NO production.
Interestingly, deficiencies in NLRP3 and caspase-1 result in
high levels of parasites in the blood and inside macrophages, which
is similar to results from MyD882/2 and iNOS2/2 mice.
However, iNOS2/2, NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice do not
succumb to infection, unlike MyD882/2 mice. The pronounced
deficiency in IFN-c production exhibited by MyD882/2 cells, but
not by NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 cells, could explain this
difference, as IFN-c2/2 mice also succumb early to infection. It is
well-established that the deficiency in IFN-c secretion by
MyD882/2 mice infected with T. cruzi reflects an impairment,
not only in the microbicidal capacity of the macrophages but also
in DC and TCD8 cell functions, as well an antibody switch to
IgG2a and FCcR induction [55]. This could also explain why the
highest number of parasites was observed in IFN-c2/2 mice
compared to all the other immunodeficient mouse strains studied
here.
Despite the ability to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, spleen
cells and macrophages from NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice
were not able to secrete NO in response to T. cruzi infection. The
role of NO in the control of T. cruzi infection is well established
[56]. Mice that are deficient in iNOS [18] or have been treated
with pharmacological iNOS inhibitors [57] [58] exhibit high levels
of parasites in the blood and can succumb to the acute phase of
infection, depending on the parasite and mouse strain. In our
model, the NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 mice behaved in a
manner identical to the iNOS2/2 mice, with a higher magnitude
of peak parasitemia compared to WT mice; however, most of the
NLRP32/2, caspase-12/2 and iNOS2/2 mice survived infection.
Macrophages isolated from the NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2
mice failed to kill amastigotes and exhibited an infection index that
was even higher than that observed in MyD882/2 macrophages.
The incapacity to control T. cruzi infection demonstrated by
NLRP32/2 and caspase-12/2 macrophages correlated with a
deficiency in NO secretion. Moreover, adding AG to T. cruzi￾infected macrophages increased the parasite burden in WT and
MyD882/2 macrophages. Conversely, no effect of AG was

observed in NLRP32/2 cells, indicating that this inflammasome is
required for NO production in response to T. cruzi infection.
The maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines IL-1b and IL-18 and the induction of pyroptosis, a
specialized form of inflammatory cell death, are the major effector
mechanisms induced by activated caspase-1 [21] [23]. While
pyroptosis is known to pay a role in controlling bacterial infections
[59], this specialized cell death process did not appear to occur
during T. cruzi infection, as the majority of the macrophages were
viable 48 hs after infection. Recently, we described a caspase-1-
dependent pathway for iNOS activation in response to cytosolic
flagellin that is mediated by NAIP5/NLRC4-inflammasomes [60].
Caspase-1-dependent iNOS activation is involved in the control of
Legionella pneumophilla [60] and Salmonella typhimurium (unpublished
data from our group) by macrophages. Interestingly, MyD88, IL￾1b and IL-18 are dispensable for iNOS activation in response to
cytosolic flagellin. IL-1b and IL-18 also appear to play a minor
role in the induction of NO production and the capacity of
macrophages to control T. cruzi infection, as a genetic defect in IL￾1R, as well as the neutralization of IL-1b and IL-18, have little
influence on these activities. Conversely, NO secretion was not
observed in caspase-12/2 macrophages or in macrophages treated
with z-YVAD-fmk, confirming the existence of a pathway of
NLRP3-mediated NO secretion in response to T. cruzi infection
that is dependent of caspase-1 but independent of IL-1b and IL￾18, the best studied caspase-1 substrates. However, the mechanism
by which caspase-1 mediates NO secretion remains unclear.
Recently, it was demonstrated that a chromatin-associated
multifunctional enzyme PARP1 (also called ARTD1) negatively
regulates the transcription of NF-kB-dependent target genes by a
pathway that requires NLRP3/caspase-1/caspase-7 activation
[61]. Mutating the PARP1 cleavage site D214 rendered PARP-1
uncleavable and inhibited PARP1 release from chromatin and
chromatin decondensation, thereby inhibiting the expression of
cleavage-dependent NF-kB target genes such as il-6, cfs2 and lif,
but not ip-10 [61]. Earlier studies showed that PARP1 cleavage is
essential for stimulus-dependent transcriptional activation of
transiently transfected reporter plasmids containing the inos and
mip2 NF-kB sites in mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) [62] [63].
Additionally, inos expression is significantly reduced in the
presence of noncleavable PARP1 (D214N), compared to cleavable
PARP1 (WT or enzymatically inactive) [64]. It was recently
demonstrated that treatment with Olaparib (a pharmacological
inhibitor of PARP-1 enzymatic activity) reduced T. cruzi replica￾tion in VERO cells [65]. However, the enzymatic activity of
PARP-1 is not related to the role of cleaved PARP-1 in the
regulation of chromatin condensation and access to transcription
factors [60]. Therefore, further studies are required to understand
Figure 6. The proposed model for NLRP3-mediated control of T. cruzi. TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 recognize T. cruzi PAMPs and control
infection by MyD88 adaptor molecule-mediated effector mechanisms. T. cruzi infection leads to lysosomal disruption, which may result in cathepsin B
release into the cytosol and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in caspase-1 activation, which
induces NO secretion in an IL-1R-independent manner. Caspase-1-dependent NO secretion appears to cooperate with MyD88-dependent pathways
to control T. cruzi infection.

the molecular machinery involved in the regulation of iNOS
activation by the caspase-1/PARP-1 axis.
TLR pathways [66], IFN-c [67] and IFN-c-related cytokines
such as IL-12 [15] [68] are known to be the major inducers of NO
production in response to T. cruzi infection. However, we
demonstrate here that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1
abrogates NO secretion by spleen cells and macrophages from
WT and MyD882/2 mice and renders their macrophages as
susceptible to T. cruzi infection as NLRP32/2, caspase-12/2 and
iNOS2/2 cells. This indicates that the requirement of NLRP3
inflammasomes for NO secretion bypasses the need for MyD88,
and identifies a novel NLRP3-dependent pathway that stimulates
NO production in response to T. cruzi infection. Despite the minor
effect of IL-1R and IL-18 on NO secretion in response to T. cruzi
infection, the amount of NO produced by macrophages and
cultured spleen cells from MyD882/2 mice is significantly lower
than that produced by WT cultures. The fact that caspase-1
inhibition in MyD882/2 cells abrogates NO production and
renders macrophages more susceptible to T. cruzi infection suggests
that the NLRP3 and MyD88 pathways cooperate to induce NO
secretion and promote host resistance to T. cruzi. Taken together,
our data describe a novel effector mechanism mediated by NLRP3
inflammasomes that contributes to the control of T. cruzi infection.
