STUDIES OF UREA EXCRETION. IV.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URINE VOLUME AND RATE OF UREA ExcRE￾TION BY PATIENTS WITH BRIGHT'S DISEASE￾By EGGERT MOLLER, JOHN F. MdINTOSH AND DONALD D. VAN SLYKE
(From the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, New York)
(Received for publication August 21, 1928) -
Previous papers from this hospital (2, 6) have shown that until the
urine volume reaches a certain augmentation limit, averaging about
2 cc. per minute, the rate of urea excretion by a normal man increases
in direct proportion to the square-root of the urine volume,rbut that
when the urine volume attains this limit urea excretion attains its
maximum, equal per-minut-eto the urea cohntent of 60 to-90 cc. of
blood, and is unaffected by further increase in urine volume.
In order to ascertain the manner in'which these relationships are
affected in Brights disease we have determined the hourly blood
urea clearances tdefihed -i-n' -a 'preceding' paper-. (6)) of a number of
patients with this-disease in whom maximum changes in urine volumes
were induced by regulating the water intake. -Results--i4rom six
typical cases are reported in this paper. The experimental technique
was identical with that outlined in the paper on normal subjects (6).
In each case- experiments on- two or more days were performed in
order to obtain the desired amount of data, but the days were suffi￾ciently close together, and the condition of each patient sufficiently
stable, to permit a fair degree of assurance that the renal function in
each subject was practically unchanged during the period.
In most of the experiments on patients Jac., Cic., Val., and Wol.,
cutaneous blood was-taken- and the urea content estimated with the
micro-gasometric method of Van Slyke (7), while in some of the
shorter expenments on these' four patients and in all the experiments
on patients Chi. and Gia. venous blood was drawn and its urea con￾tent estimated with the aeration method of Van Slyke and Cullen (8).
In two cases, patients Val. and Wol., it was impossible to get urine

volumes as low and as high respectively as desired, although many
attempts on different days were made. This was due to the loss of
the power of concentration and of dilution respectively in these two
patients.
The laboratory findings in our 6 cases of Bright's disease are given
in table 1. The terms of classification are those used by Addis (1).
CASE HISTORIES
Case 1. Chi. Hospital No. 5335. Boy, 13 years old. When 7 years old he
had acute glomerulonephritis, now relapse with hematuria and some edema.

Wash. Publ. No. 302, 1921, p. 61.
Surface areas of other patients are calculated by Du Bois' formula.
No loss of ability to excrete urea or phthalein. Course of the disease: After 6
weeks sent home with no edema, only a trace of albuminuria, and a slight micro￾scopic hematuria. Seen 6 months and one year later, when the hematuria had
quite disappeared, while the slight albuminuria persisted. Other findings normal.
Case 2. Jac. Hospital No. 5699. Man, 24 years old. One year ago,
tonsillitis followed by albuiminuria and marked edema. This deared up gradually
in 6 months, but after chrysarobin treatment for psoriasis severe relapse set in
with edema, ascites and hydrothoras. Course of the disease: Edema and anasarca
cleared up completely in one month. Seen 6 months later, there was then no
edema and only a few red cells and casts in the urine.
Case 3. Cic. Hospital No. 5644. Man, 24 years old. Syphilis found 6
years ago, since then repeated treatment with salvarsan and mercury. One

year ago edema and ascites began, both stiLl present. Renal function diminished.
Wassermann reaction negative. Course of the disease: Edema nearly disappeared
after 3 months. Seen 6 months later, when the condition was unchanged as at
discharge from hospital.
Case 4. Val. Hospital No. 5446. Man, 24 years old. The last year some
edema, hematuria and dyspnea on exertion have been present. Now only slight
edema. Diminished ability to excrete urea and phthalein. Course of the disease:
After 3 months, hematuria much decreased and the blood hemoglobin content
somewhat increased. Seen 3 months later, when the condition was unchanged.
Case 5. Gia. Hospital No. 5338. Man, 24 years old. Tonsillitis, bronchitis
and pleurisy 8 months ago, followed by marked edema, ascites, oliguria and
hematuria. Now no ascites, only slight edema, no hematuria; but dyspnea on
exertion. Marked loss of renal function. Unusual normal blood pressure and
normal heart, despite advanced renal disease and function loss. Course of the
disease: Died 9 months later in uremia. Histological diagnosis: Chronic glo￾merulonephritis.
Case 6. Wol. Hospital No. 5731. Scarlet fever 6 years ago. During the
convalescence albiuminuria appeared and has been present since then. 10 months
ago, moderate edema, nausea and vomiting set in and hypertension was found.
Since then the condition has somewhat improved. On admission only a trace
of edema and a little nausea were present. Phthalein excretion in 2 hours was
25 to 31 per cent. Course of the disease: During 3 months, nausea and edema
disappeared. Five months later the patient was re-examined. Although he was
subjectively well, progress towards uremia was indicated by a blood creatinine
of 4.8 mgm. per cent and a blood urea nitrogen of 56 mgm. The data recorded
in table 3 were obtained 6 weeks after the first admission.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results are given in table 3 and in figures 1 to 6. The clear￾ance values are corrected for body size, by calculating them from
1.73 observed V values multiplied by the factor 1.73 as
sq. m. ideal area a
described in the preceding paper (6). The correction factors are
given in table 2.
As in the normal subjects reported in the foregoing paper, the same
effect of a given urine volume on urea excretion was observed,
whether the volume had been reached through increase or decrease.
For 5 of the 6 patients the position of the augmentation limit has

been calculated as in the preceding paper. The results are given in
table 3. For the sixth patient (Wol.) such a calculation was not
possible because of his failing ability to put out large volumes of
water.
The points determined after previous ingestion of urea are indi￾cated on the charts by black discs, those determined on the days
when no urea had been given, by hollow circles. It is apparent from
figures 2 and 3 that the results are not to any important degree in￾fluenced by urea ingestion.'
Two facts are at once apparent from the figures. The first is that
the urea excretion curves of these patients in five cases out of six
are much lower than any observed normal curve. The second is that
the pathological curves resemble the normal ones in that, when urea
excretion is plotted against the square root of urine volume, each
curve is composed of 2 straight lines, an ascending line showing urea
excretion increasing with urine volume over the lower ranges of the
latter, and a horizontal line, at higher volume ranges, representing
maximum excretion. These two lines intersect, as in normal sub￾jects, at an augmentation limit. In the case of patient Wol., only
the sloping first part of the curve remains, diminution of power to
excrete water had rendered unattainable the urine volumes repre￾sented on all or nearly all of the horizontal part. In patient VaL,
on the other hand, most of the ascending part is lost through loss of
power of concentration. Only enough remains to suggest the bend
of the curve at the augmentation limit.
1 Addis (Arch. Int. Med., 1922, xxx, 378) considers it essential to place the
kidneys under strain by administration of urea and water in order to force them
to maximum effort, whereby functional deficits should be revealed that would
otherwise escape notice. The idea is logical, and is supported by Addis' results
with partially nephrectomized animals. We have accordingly expected to find
some patients in the initial stages of declining renal function, who would still
show normal standard and maxmum clearances under ordinary living conditions,
but would reveal deficits in the maim dearance when fed urea-- and water
under the conditions of Addis' test. This expectation has, however, never been
realized. In observations on patients with the various types of Bright's disease,
with all variations in renal function from normal to practically zero, we have not
yet encountered one in whom the conditions of the Addis test revealed a func￾tional deficit when the blood urea clearance, determined without urea feeding,
did not do so, nor have we seen any in whom the degree of deficit found was
significantly increased by imposing the conditions of the Addis test.

UREA EXCRETION
In figure 7 the same urea excretion curve as the one given in figure
5 has been plotted on logarithmic paper. In the logarithmic curve
variations in height are proportional to percentage changes, rather
than absolute changes, in the data plotted. In a uremic case, the
clearance values are all so low that variations on them are inconspicu￾ous, when plotted on an ordinary scale, as in figure 5. But when
plotted logarithmically, as in figure 7, they are as evident as the
clearance variations of a normal subject.
The values for the augmentation limits, given in table 4, are on
the whole somewhat lower than those found for normal subjects in
the preceding paper (6). The average figures for nephritic and
normal subjects are 1.73 and 2.13 cc. per minute respectively. The
decrease in augmentation limit is hardly great enough to justify the
conclusion that it represents an effect of the disease. It is not very
significant compared with the relatively great fall in the leveJ of the
curves observed in cases with damaged renal function.
In each case there is, compared with the normal, a fall of nearly
equal proportions in the level of the ascending line and in that of the
horizontal line reached at the augmentation limits, with relatively
small change in the limit. Consequently the standard blood urea
clearance, indicated by the height of the ascending line at V = 1 cc.
-per minute; and the maximum clearance, indicated by the height at
the augmentation limit and beyond, show in these cases approxi￾mately equal percentage dimiautions below the normal. The
similarity in the significance of results by the maximum and standard
clearance determinations is also indicated by the agreement between
the percentages of normal values shown by the two clearances for
each individual, indicated by the figures with and without stars.
respectively in the last column of table 3.
In table 4 the variations for the standard and maximum clearances
in each patient are given. The table shows that, as previously found
with normal individuals, the average variation in a given subject is
slightly greater for the standard clearance than for the maximum
clearance.
In figure 8 all the curves are presented, with scales indicating the
per cent of normal standard and maximum clearance observed in
each case. It is apparent that both dearances tend to show about
the same percentage fall in cases with reiial deficiency.

E. MOLLER, J. F. MCINTOSH AND D. D. VAN SLYKE
Of the 5 cases with urea excreting power, as indicated by the blood
urea clearances, consistently reduced to from 40 to 12 per cent of
the average normal, all except one (Gia.), showed at times blood urea
nitrogen below the maximum (23 mgm. per cent) found by MacKay
and MacKay (4) in normal subjects. These results confirm the
conclusion of these authors (3), that more than half the functioning
tissue of the kidneys may be destroyed before the blood urea rises
above normal limits.
In subjects with such renal loss the blood urea may, in fact, even
be less than the normal average. Thus in experiments 10-a and 20-c
blood urea nitrogen of only 10 to 12 mgm. per 100 cc. is seen, despite
the fact that both subjects showed only about 40 per cent of mean
normal excreting power. Such results indicate the uncertainty
attending interpretation of normal blood urea values in nephritic
patients if the urea excretion rate is not also taken into consideration.
It has in fact been common on our wards to find consistently normal
blood ureas in nephritic patients who have lost 40 to 60 per cent of
their renal function. Such patients are likely, either by choice or
direction, to take diets low in protein: and if they consume half as
much as a given normal subject, other factors being equal, they will
show about normal blood urea content. If, in addition, they drink
more water, they may have even less blood urea than many normal
subjects. In the cases to be presented in a later paper there are
numerous examples of this fact.
SUID[ARY
1. Data are presented showing the relationship between urine
volume and urea excretion in 6 patients with Bright's disease, in
stages varying from an acute case with normal urea excreting ability
to an advanced chronic case with only one-eighth of normal urea
excreting power.
2. The rate of urea excretion in these patients was found to vary
with blood urea content and urine volume in the same manner as in
normal subjects.
3. The standard blood urea dearance, representing the cubic
centimeters of blood cleared of urea by 1 minute's excretion when
urine volume is 1 cc. per minute, and the maximum clearance, with
503

UREA EXCIRETION
.~
urine volumes above the augmentation limit of about 2 cc. per minute,
proved to be equally sensitive as indicators of renal function in these
nephritics.
4. Our data confirm MacKay and MacKay (3) in showing that
loss of renal function may exceed 60 per cent before the blood urea
content rises above the highest level observed in normal subjects.
Unless the excretion rate is also considered, the blood urea, taken
alone, may fail to reveal diminishing renal ability until the latter
has reached an advanced stage.
