Abstract


Pulmonary aspergillomas usually occur when Aspergillus fungi
colonise lung tissue previously damaged by disease. Pulmonary
aspergillomas in three adult patients with cystic fibrosis are
reported--an association not previously described. At the time of
diagnosis all three patients had previous long term colonisation
with Aspergillus fumigatus and severe advanced destructive lung
disease with lung function less than 25% of the predicted normal
values. It is likely that, with increasing survival in cystic fibrosis,
more adult patients will develop aspergillomas during the
protracted phase of end stage lung disease that characterises the
terminal years of this condition.
