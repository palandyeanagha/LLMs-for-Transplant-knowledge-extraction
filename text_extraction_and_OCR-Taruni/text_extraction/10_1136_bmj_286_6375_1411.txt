Meconium ileus equivalent in older patients with
cystic fibrosis
J G HANLY, M X FITZGERALD
Abstract
Meconium ileus equivalent is one of the lesser known
manifestations of cystic fibrosis, and occurs most often
in older patients. With the improved overall survival of
patients with cystic fibrosis, one would expect to see this
condition more often in the future. Of 53 patients attend￾ing our cystic fibrosis clinic for adolescents and adults,
eight had experienced a total of 25 episodes of meconium
ileus equivalent. Recurrent attacks occurred in seven
patients, of whom four had at least four separate, well
documented episodes: these episodes were associated
with obvious recognised precipitating factors in only
three patients. All patients responded to appropriate
medical treatment with acetylcysteine or sodium diatri￾zoate, including three who had previously undergone
surgery for meconium ileus equivalent elsewhere.
Controversies remain, however, concerning the role of
prophylactic medical management with acetylcysteine,
sodium diatrizoate, and pancreatic supplements.
Introduction
Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 85% to 90o% of cases of
cystic fibrosis,' and one of the lesser known of these is meconium
ileus equivalent. This term is used to describe partial or complete
bowel obstruction, wlhch results from abnormally viscid muco￾faeculent material in the terminal ileum and right colon, where
the faecal stream is normally liquid. It occurs outside the
neonatal period, often in older patients,2 and usually presents as
recurrent abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, or a palpable
caecal mass. To date there has been a paucity of published
reports on the aetiology, clinical features, and specific manage￾ment of the condition.' We describe eight patients with
meconium ileus equivalent, seven of whom had recurrent attacks,
and review the controversial subjects of diagnosis and treatment.
Patients and methods
The case notes and x ray films of 53 patients attending the adolescent
and adult cystic fibrosis clinic at St Vincent's Hospital were reviewed.
Where possible, notes relating to admissions to other hospitals were
also examined. Criteria for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis included

typical clinical features, and a raised sweat sodium concentration of
greater than 70 mmol(mEq)/l. Meconium ileus equivalent was
diagnosed if at least one of the following criteria was fulfilled: (a)
recurrent abdominal pain, due to well documented faecal impaction
or constipation; (b) recurrent palpable caecal masses; or (c) complete
intestinal obstruction, caused by firm faecal material in the terminal
ileum or right colon, or both.
Patients with asymptomatic palpable caecal masses were observed
without active intervention. All patients with intestinal obstruction or
persistent severe colicky abdominal pain were managed medically.
They received acetylcysteine 122 mol/l (20 g/100 ml), 10 ml four
times daily, given as a sweet drink to mask the unpalatable taste,
and acetylcysteine 1 22 mol/l (20 g/100 ml), 50 ml administered as an
enema, with 50 ml of water, one to four times a day, depending on the
degree of intestinal obstruction. On one occasion when intestinal
obstruction was very severe sodium diatrizoate was added, 30 ml
three times a day orally, and 100 ml three times a day as an enema.
Patients continued their usual dose of pancreatic supplements, were
kept well hydrated with intravenous fluids, and had analgesics for
pain control. We did not use nasogastric intubation routinely, although
this may be helpful in some cases of severe obstruction and avoids the
unpleasant taste of acetylcysteine.
Results
Eight of the 53 patients (five boys, three girls) were found to have
meconium ileus equivalent. The table summarises the findings. Age at
initial presentation ranged from 1W to 17 years, and all but one (case 8)
had recurrent attacks. Modes of presentation included colicky
abdominal pain (eight patients), palpable caecal mass (four patients),
clinical and radiological evidence of intestinal obstruction (three
patients), and intussusception (one patient). Radiological abnormalities
were found in all six patients whose x ray films were available for
review; these abnormalities included bubbly faecal material in the
large bowel' (six patients), multiple air-fluid levels in the small bowel
(three patients), and intussusception (one patient). No precipitating
factors were identified in five patients. In three patients potential
factors included respiratory tract infections (cases 6 and 8), immobilis￾ation (cases 5 and 6), and sudden withdrawal of pancreatic supplements
with concurrent administration of diphenoxylate (case 8).
Although all patients were treated medically by us, three patients
had undergone operations without a trial of medical treatment before
referral to our unit: one (case 1) for exploration of an abdominal mass,
another (case 2) for relief of intestinal obstruction, and a third (case 5)
for intussusception on two separate occasions. Despite surgical
treatment, all three patients continued to have recurrent episodes of
meconium ileus equivalent, which responded to appropriate medical
treatment. The major complication was intussusception, which
occurred twice in one month in one patient (case 5) after a prolonged
attack of unequivocal meconium ileus equivalent, prompting surgical
intervention on both occasions.
On medical treatment alone, there was symptomatic improvement
in all cases in less than 24 hours, usually coinciding with the passing
of stools per rectum. Some patients, however, continued to have
abdominal pain for five days after the start of treatment. As the
obstruction resolved, the frequency of oral medications and enemas
was reduced and eventually stopped. The duration of treatment with

We did not continue these agents once the acute attack had resolved.
For prophylactic medical management, we asked patients to avoid
potential precipitating factors, particularly drugs that might promote
constipation, to maintain a high fluid intake and high dietary roughage,
and to take regular pancreatic enzyme supplements. Occasionally a
stool softener such as lactulose was added.
Discussion
The term meconium ileus equivalent encompasses a broad
range of clinical manifestations arising from partial or complete
intestinal obstruction. It may be classified into three groups,
based on the mode of presentation: (a) recurrent abdominal pain,
secondary to well documented faecal impaction or constipation;
(b) recurrent palpable caecal masses, which may resolve spon￾taneously; and (c) complete intestinal obstruction, caused by
abnormally viscid and impacted intestinal contents.
Patients with complete intestinal obstruction almost invariably
have an acute onset of symptoms; whereas those with other
symptoms have a subacute presentation. The prevalence of
meconium ileus equivalent in patients with cystic fibrosis is
difficult to determine but is said to be from 1% to 10%.3 In our
series it was 15%.
The clinical and radiological features of the condition (figure)
may be explained by the abnormal consistency of the bowel
contents in the terminal ileum and right colon. These are semi￾solid or solid and extremely viscid compared with the liquid faecal
stream normally found in this part of the bowel.4 Material
may accumulate to form a painless mass, or cause partial or
complete obstruction of the bowel lumen.
The reason for the abnormal bowel contents is not entirely
clear, but they may result from tenacious intestinal mucus,6
abnormal intestinal mucoproteins,7 and pancreatic insufficiency.4
Hallberg described a patient with obstruction whose bowel wall
was coated with a thick adherent mucilaginous membrane,8 and
Snyder et al reported three similar cases, in whom there was a
thick layer of mucus adhering to the intestinal mucosa.6 This
abnormal mucus originates from hypertrophied intestinal
glands,4 many of which are distended with inspissated mucus.
Additionally, the duodenal contents of older patients with cystic
fibrosis contain abnormal mucoproteins, which are water
insoluble7 and increase the viscosity of bowel contents. Pancreatic
insufficiency may also contribute, because sudden withdrawal of
pancreatic supplements may precipitate meconium ileus

equivalent, and their reintroduction helps to relieve the obstruc￾tion.9 Pancreatic enzymes have been shown to act on the
intestinal mucus to release water soluble fragments, thereby
reducing viscosity.'0
The commonest presentation in our group was abdominal
pain, with or without intestinal obstruction, and this is similar
to the findings of other workers.' Clinical and radiological
examination must be used to eliminate other causes of abdominal
pain in this age group, such as simple colonic constipation and
intussusception without meconium ileus equivalent. A palpable
faecal mass in the right lower quadrant may accompany
abdominal pain or occur independently of it, in which case it
must be distinguished from other causes of masses in this area
such as an appendix abscess and Crohn's disease. Attacks may
occur spontaneously or be precipitated by a number of factors,

particularly sudden withdrawal of pancreatic supplements.2
This precipitated attacks in one of our patients; others followed
immobilisation, respiratory infections, and use of antidiarrhoeal
agents. There is a tendency for meconium ileus equivalent to
recur,22" and in our group seven out of eight patients had more
than one attack, with a total of 25 episodes in all. Intussusception"2
and, less frequently, volvulus"3 are the main complications. One
patient (case 5) in our group had two episodes of intussusception,
which required surgical intervention on both occasions after
radiological contrast studies confirmed the diagnosis.
The treatment of choice for uncomplicated cases of meconium
ileus equivalent is medical. Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent,
which reduces viscosity by cleaving disulphide bonds in muco￾protein molecules.'4 This usually gives speedy relief of intestinal
obstruction,'5 16 and is commonly used in concentrations of
0-6-1-2 mol/l (10-20 g/100 ml) three times daily, by mouth and by
enema.4 The recommended volume of acetylcysteine varies from
5 to 30 ml given three to six times daily.4 16 We found our regimen
of 10 ml four times daily to be effective. All our patients showed
a symptomatic improvement within 24 hours, coinciding with the
passage of stools per rectum. In cases of complete intestinal
obstruction, or when acetylcysteine alone is ineffective, sodium
diatrizoate is sometimes added to this regimen.3 This radio-opaque
aqueous solution acts through its detergent and hypertonic
properties and may be given by mouth or by enema. In addition,
the patient's pancreatic supplements are continued and a high
fluid intake is maintained.
Surgical intervention is only warranted when a reasonable
trial of medical treatment has failed to relieve obstruction, or
when complications such as intussusception, or volvulus occur.
Surgery must be avoided if at all possible, however, because of
poor respiratory function. Furthermore, excessive manipulation
of the bowel during operation (which is often necessary due to
the abnormal faecal content) may predispose to the formation
of adhesions.2 In addition, it is often impossible to remove
firmly adherent inspissated bowel contents without resecting a
length of bowel.
The correct prophylactic management of patients with
meconium ileus equivalent is less certain. Some authors have
suggested that patients should be maintained on a regular oral
regimen of acetylcysteine.4 Acetylcysteine is, however, very
expensive and highly unpalatable, although the unpalatability
may be partly overcome by chilling and mixing with a sweet
drink. In addition, no data clearly show that acetylcysteine or,
indeed, sodium diatrizoate is more effective than other simpler
and less expensive therapeutic agents such as laxatives and
dietary roughage. Consequently, our policy has been to advise
patients to avoid precipitating factors, to maintain a high fluid
intake and dietary roughage, and, if necessary, to take stool
softeners such as lactulose. It is clear that a well controlled study
is required to assess accurately the role of acetylcysteine, sodium
diatrizoate, and other modalities of treatment in the acute and
chronic management of this troublesome and increasingly
common manifestation of cystic fibrosis.

Does taking babies "swimming" in the first few weeks of life reduce the
risk of cot deaths ?
The theory that swimming may be protective against cot deaths
comes from the application of a "diving reflex" possessed by many
vertebrates, but relatively weak in man. Submersion causes bradycardia
and peripheral vasoconstriction, protecting the blood supply to the
heart, lungs, and brain in order to avoid asphyxiation. As it is
hypothesised that some cot deaths are triggered by recurrent episodes
of hypoxia, regular exercise of this reflex while awake might condition
the baby to survive prolonged apnoea while asleep. This is speculation.
Investigations of cot deaths nearly always produce clues to the cause
of death which would be expected to override any protection. The
dangers of supervised bathing in the first three months of life (the
age necessary if benefit were to be gained) are poorly documented
because the enthusiasm is such a recent phenomenon. Hypothermia
or infection are obvious possibilities. A 10 month old child became
apnoeic and nearly died of water intoxication without immediate
appreciation that he had swallowed excessive amounts during a
swimming lesson.' If this were to happen to only one in 500 babies,
in several thousand swims, the risk would outweigh any possible
benefit.-A N STANTON, consultant paediatrician, Scarborough.

Is prostatic hypertrophy often accompanied by a diminution in sexual
activity ? If so is it connected with reduced circulating androgens ? Is there
any place in simple (non-malignant) prostatic hypertrophy for prophylactic
androgens and possibly palliative androgens when urinary symptoms
develop ?
There is no scientific evidence to support the "suggestion" that
sexual activity is diminished in prostatic hypertrophy. The only
observation supporting this so far as I know is that in dogs prostatic
hypertrophy seems to occur more often in animals kept secluded as
domestic pets while at the same time prostatic hypertrophy is much
less common in the pi-dog that is allowed to roam. This may suggest
that diminished sexual activity might possibly be one factor in the
aetiology of prostatic hypertrophy. Habib' discusses at length the
factors controlling abnormal growth of the prostate, and any reduction
in circulating androgens is not specifically associated with prostatic
hypertrophy. As regards the prophylactic management of so-called
benign prostatic hypertrophy, the treatment with androgens or
oestrogens has never proved to be of any lasting value.-j P MITCHELL,
