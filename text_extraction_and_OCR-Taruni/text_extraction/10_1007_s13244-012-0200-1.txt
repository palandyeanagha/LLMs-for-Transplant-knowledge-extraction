Abstract
Background Benign biliary postoperative stenoses and bili￾ary leaks and fistulas usually occur due to injury after
laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gastric or hepatic resection,
bilio-enteric anastomoses and after liver transplantation. In
most of the cases a new surgical intervention is not possible
and the percutaneous trans-hepatic approach is of para￾mount importance in the diagnosis and treatment of the
problem. This review aims to highlight the spectrum of
percutaneous cholangiographic findings and methods of
treatment of postoperative benign biliary stenoses and bili￾ary leaks and fistulas. In the case of stenosis, dilation of the
narrow tract is the usually the first approach, whereas in the
case of leaks and fistulas bile diversion with drainage is
usually attempted in order to seal the fistulous tract. How￾ever, a great variety of combination of materials and techni￾ques may be used on a “case-by case” approach
Methods A selection of cases of benign biliary postopera￾tive stenoses and biliary leaks and fistulas that were man￾aged percutaneously are presented and the most common
lines of approach are discussed.
Conclusion The imaging spectrum of percutaneous treat￾ment of benign biliary postoperative stenoses and biliary
leaks and fistulas is presented in order to aid interpretation
and management with image guided procedures.
Teaching Points
• Treatment of benign biliary stenosis is performed with
cholangioplasty and stents.
• The main goal of fistula treatment is to divert the bile
away from the site of bile wall defect.
• Drain collection and tract embolisation are the other
options for bile leak percutaneous treatment.

Introduction
Interventional radiology (IR) has an established role in the
diagnosis and management of patients with benign biliary
disease. Postoperative benign biliary stenoses and/or biliary
leaks and fistulas may be effectively treated with dilatation
of the narrowed anastomotic tract or bile diversion away
from the site of defect in the bile wall. A large variety of
combination of dilatation and drainage may be used on a
“case-by-case” basis with the use of various techniques and
materials. Purpose of this pictorial review is to highlight the
general lines of approach and to show the range of imaging
findings of the percutaneous treatment of postoperative be￾nign biliary stenoses and biliary leaks and fistulas.
Etiology
Postoperative benign biliary strictures may occur as anasto￾motic strictures after surgical bile duct repair or liver trans￾plantation, strictures secondary to intraoperative injury
(most commonly during laparoscopic cholecystectomy) or
postoperative inflammatory strictures [1]. Effective manage￾ment is necessary in such cases in order to avoid serious

consequences like liver function deterioration, cholangitis,
jaundice, abscess formation and sepsis [1].
Endoscopic treatment is the optimal initial management for
benign biliary strictures; however, the endoscopic approach is
impossible for patients who have previously undergone bilio￾digestive anastomosis [2] and may be very difficult in tight
low biliary strictures [3]. In such cases, percutaneous treat￾ment with balloon dilation with or without long-term biliary
drainage and bare or covered stent placement, have been
suggested as possible alternatives [2, 4–8].
Biliary leaks and fistulas are also a common complication
after liver and biliary surgery. Leaks and fistulas may take
origin from various procedures like bilio-digestive anasto￾moses, bile or cystic duct stumps or other intraoperative bile
duct injury [9, 10]. Despite reduction in mortality for hepatic
surgery in the last 2 decades, bile leaks rates have not
changed significantly. Most bile leaks from the intra￾hepatic biliary tree are transient and managed conservatively
by drainage alone or by endoscopic biliary decompression.
Minimally invasive percutaneous techniques for the man￾agement of biliary leaks and fistulas include percutaneous
bile collection drainage, percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary
drainage, biliary leak site embolisation sclerosis, ablation of
a leaking biliary segment and treatment with a covered stent.
The most frequent causes of benign strictures of the
biliary tree can be related to postoperative injury not only
after open or video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy (VLC)
but also after gastric or hepatic resection, portacaval shunt
and bilio-enteric anastomosis [1]. Many factors, including
inadequate exposure, congenital anomalies, obesity, hostile
abdomen, acute pre-existing cholecystitis and bleeding, in￾crease the rate of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy
[11]. In addition, thermic injuries to the ductal wall pro￾duced by the propagation of heat during electrocutting or
electrocoagulation may produce a progressive stenosis more
often localised at the level of the bifurcation [12].
Liver transplantation (OLT) can represent a cause of injury
to the biliary system including leaks and strictures. Strictures
may be localised at the level of the anastomosis, in the intra￾hepatic portion or diffuse, as seen in cases of hepatic artery
thrombosis with an incidence of 10 % as reported by Zoepf et
al. [13]. Moreover there is an increased incidence of subse￾quent diffuse biliary stenosis or “ischaemic cholangiopathy”
in liver recipients. These patients can be treated either endo￾scopically or with radiological percutaneous approach with a
success rate respectively of 100 % and 78 % [14]. The treat￾ment selection is correlated to the initial surgical procedure
and to the accessibility to the lesion.
Biliary leaks are an abnormal passage or communication
from the biliary system to another location, intra- or extra￾hepatic, and most commonly follow gallbladder surgery but
can result from ductal injury related to blunt or sharp trauma or
iatrogenic injury (e.g. liver biopsy) [15]. The most commonly
accepted definition of a bile leak requires the presence of bile
discharge from an abdominal wound and/or drain, with a total
bilirubin level of >5 mg/ml or three-times the serum level,
intra-abdominal collections of bile confirmed by percutaneous
aspiration or cholangiographic evidence of dye leaking from
the opacified bile ducts [16]. Surgery for hydatid disease may
also lead to internal biliary leaks, with a frequency between
4 % and 28 %, mainly when deeply located cysts and right
lobe cysts are excised [17].
The incidence of bile leaks following liver resection
varies from 2 % to 30 % [18] and depends on the type,
extent and reason for liver resection, with higher risk for
intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas [19]. The risk of internal
leak is higher after central hepatectomy involving segments
IV, V and VIII, possibly due to drainage from aberrant right
sided ducts draining into left duct.
Clinical presentation
The clinical presentation of postoperative benign biliary
stenoses may be divided into an early and late phase. The
early phase is usually secondary to an acute obstruction of
the bile duct and becomes clinically evident with an increase
jaundice and alteration of liver function tests. Fever and
infection may not be present, but may appear later.
The clinical presentation of biliary leaks and fistulas is
usually with abdominal pain and raised inflammatory
markers in the immediate postoperative period [20].
Imaging methods and findings
Trans-abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography
(CT) of the upper abdomen and magnetic resonance
cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) are the principal, non￾invasive, imaging modalities in the evaluation of the liver
parenchyma and the biliary tree.
MRCP is most frequently used in the case of a suspected
stricture; the accuracy of MRCP versus the invasive endo￾scopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) on
the analysis of the type and site of obstruction is 76 %
versus 72 % respectively [21].
In the case of bile leaks and fistulas, ultrasound and CT
may help in the detection of the localised collections of bile
or bile lying free in the peritoneal cavity. CT scanning may
be used in conjunction with intravenous cholangiography
(CT-IVC) to produce axial and three-dimensional images
[22]. This technique is very useful in the detection of
stones and in the creation of virtual cholangiographic
pictures and may be very valuable in defining sites of
leaks as it has the functional dimension that conven￾tional MRCP does not.
78 Insights Imaging (2013) 4:77–84

However, if a leak is suspected, the best way to prove it is
with the use of an invasive cholangiogram, either endoscop￾ic or percutaneous. A cholangiogram is a dynamic exam that
is able to demonstrate the origin of the leak and to delineate
the fistulous tract [23] and is useful in deciding the optimal
management and the likelihood of success with conservative
measures. The most frequent site of leak demonstrated chol￾angiographically is the cystic duct stump post-laparoscopic
cholecystectomy [24]. Radionuclide scans may also offer
information in the case of bile leaks [25].
Lesion classification
Biliary strictures and leaks are classified according to two
widely used systems: the Bismuth classification, which is
based on the location of stricture, and the Strasberg classi￾fication, which is based on the location of biliary leak [26,
27]. Bergman et al. [28] modified the Strasberg classifica￾tion according to ERCP findings into four major types: Type
A, leakage from cystic duct or peripheral hepatic radicles;
Type B, leakage from a major bile duct; Type C, isolated
ductal stricture; Type D, complete transection of the bile
duct. Biliary leaks have been classified by Nagano et al. [16]
into four types: Type A, minor leaks from small bile radicles
on the surface of the liver; Type B, leaks from inadequate
closure of the major bile duct branches on the liver’s sur￾face; Type C, injury to the main duct commonly near the
hilum; Type D, leakage due to a transected duct disconnect￾ed from the main duct.
Percutaneous management of postoperative strictures
The main indications for a percutaneous treatment of a
postoperative benign biliary stricture are: (1) poor patient’s
general condition that does not permit another surgical in￾tervention, (2) presence of altered anatomy that does not
permit the endoscopic approach, (3) septic status that
requires a quick approach for decompression of the biliary
tree. The main contraindication is the presence of non￾correctable bleeding disorder.
The treatment goals should be to improve and maintain bile
duct patency as well as preventing stricture recurrence through
a minimal invasive procedure. In the last 30 years percutane￾ous treatment of benign biliary strictures, with balloon dilata￾tion and stenting, has been widely accepted as a valid
therapeutic option with allow complication rate [29].
In the case of stenosis the biliary system is expected to be
dilated and therefore easy to access percutaneously with US￾guided puncture. However, in benign biliary stenosis often
the ducts are not widely dilated as may be expected and US￾guided puncture may not be straight forward. In such cases a
central puncture with a 22-G needle be performed and
obtain a cholangiographic picture and then perform a fluo￾roscopically guided puncture.
Once access in the biliary tree is obtained the next task
will be that of crossing the stenosis with a guidewire. If a
guidewire is advanced through the stenotic tract then there
are two options: (1) advance an internal-external drain cath￾eter and exchange the catheter gradually every 3 weeks to a
larger diameter in order to dilate slowly the tract or (2)
perform balloon dilatation of the stenotic area every 2-3
weeks upsizing the balloon in every session and having a
5-Fr access catheter left in situ. The presence of the internal￾external drain is reducing the quality of life of the patient as
this process may be long and require a period of 4–6 months
and the external line is more prone to infections. In addition,
the presence of a drain in situ helps quicker tract maturation.
In case of necessity of repeated dilatations for biliary
stenoses and lack of endoscopic access instead of leaving
an external access catheter a transjejunal approach may be
performed. In such cases the procedure is performed via the
fixed limb (either afferent or efferent limb) of a Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy which had been created to repair bili￾ary strictures or bile duct injuries, or specifically for the
percutaneous biliary access to treat strictures or stones.
The efferent limb of the Roux loop is surgically fixed to
the peritoneum in a right anterior location, or the afferent
limb is fixed anteriorly in the central upper abdomen. The
loop can then be punctured under fluoroscopic or CT guid￾ance usually with a thin needle; once access to the jejunum
is obtained the biliary tree is catheterised in a retrograde
fashion and bilioplasty may be performed. In the series by
Fontein et al. [30] in 425 out of 494 (86 %) interventions the
Roux loop was successfully accessed. The percentage of
success was significantly higher for a fixed Roux loop
(94 %) versus a non fixed loop (85 %). In only a very small
percentage of cases a percutaneous trans-hepatic access was
necessary. Interval cholangitis occurred in the 14 % of the
patients and in eight cases postprocedural sepsis occurred.
Balloon dilatation is usually performed with an 8 or 10
mm wide and 2 to 4 cm long balloon. The size of the balloon is
related to the type and location of the stenosis: a l0 mm
balloon is generally used for common bile duct stenosis, while
for lesions located in the intra-hepatic ducts 6 to 8 mm
balloons may be selected. In case of biliary-enteric anastomo￾ses, it is useful to perform the dilation using a larger balloon,
varying from 10 to 20 mm in diameter; high pressure balloons
may also be used and be inflated up to 22 Atm. Dilation needs
to be slow and progressive in order to avoid laceration of the
duct and massive bleeding into the biliary system and it may
be repeated several times in particularly in case of fibrotic
stenosis. The type of stricture is important in defining the
response from dilalation. In the case of OLT anastomotic
strictures (AS) appear to have a better response when
Insights Imaging (2013) 4:77–84 79

compared with non-anastomotic strictures that are caused by
ischaemic injury [31].
In recent years, the introduction of a cutting balloon
(Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) has been described
in those patients with severe hard stenosis or fibrotic steno￾sis reducing the incidence of elastic recoil [32]. The cutting
balloon is a non-compliant balloon with four blades at right
angles to each other. When the balloon is inflated, the blades
cut the adjacent fibrous tissue, while the non-compliant
balloon stretches the duct wall increasing the inner luminal
diameter. Certainly there is higher risk of complications like
bleeding, perforation and also rupture of the biliary duct.
In case of biliary lithiasis—even though rare in a postop￾erative stenosis—dilation of the papilla must be performed
to facilitate the passage of stones into the bowel by pushing
through the papilla, into the bowel, stones usually less than
1 cm in diameter. In case of stones larger than 1 cm extra￾corporeal lithotripsy must be performed.
Recurrent stenosis after catheter or balloon dilation of
benign biliary strictures may occur in 29–58 % of cases [29,
33]; to avoid this complication and to maximise the
treatment outcomes, the treatment strategy may involve
stent placement. However the role of stent placement after
dilation is controversial because, while it may improve long￾term success, the tube itself may stimulate inflammatory
reaction, fibrosis and stone formation [32, 34]. Removal of
the stent may be considered in the case of benign strictures
that may be reached endocopically. The evaluation of the
results before stent removal is usually based on
cholangiographic-morphological criteria: decreased or nor￾mal calibre of the biliary ducts, disappearance of cholangitis
and an absence of “filling defects” in the stenotic tract
indicate a good result of the treatment. However, bare self￾expandable metallic stents (SEMS) can create tissue hyper￾plasia and embedment, which would preclude stent removal,
and so is not a recommended treatment for the benign
condition. Therefore, covered metallic stents have been
created and used in benign disease.
A study of 79 patients who underwent placement of par￾tially covered metallic stents (Wallstent; Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA, USA) for a variety of benign biliary stenoses
including chronic pancreatitis, biliary stone disease, post-OLT

and post-surgery showed that overall success rate was about
90 % after leaving the stents in place for 4 months. Stricture
resolution rate was noted to be lowest in chronic pancreatitis.
The authors were able to remove all stents after biliary de￾compression, as confirmed by clinical and laboratory investi￾gation. Median follow-up time after stent removal was
12 months. Stent migration occurred in 14 % of cases, and
tissue hyperplasia at the proximal uncovered portion of the
stent, resulting in stricture was also noted in some patients
[35]. To overcome the limitation of partially covered stents,
fully covered self-expandable metal stents were developed
and used in benign disease. The efficacy of covered stents in
the treatment of anastomotic strictures following OLT is very
promising. The stricture resolution rate ranges from 87.5 to
95.5 % at a follow-up period of 6–12 months. Recurrence of
the stricture occurs in a very small number of patients. Stent
migration is observed in many patients but no major compli￾cations have been reported [35, 36].
Covered stents have also the advantage that may be re￾moved percutaneously; therefore, they are used in patients that
are not suitable for endoscopic options [37]. In a retrospective
comparison of percutaneously removed covered stents versus
balloon dilatation in 66 patients, the primary patency of stents
was 87 % at 3 years with a shorter catheter indwelling period.
In two cases covered stent migration occurred and in one case
the stent could not be removed [38].
Percutaneous management of biliary leaks and fistulas
The goals of percutaneous treatment in biliary leaks and
fistulas are: (1) to dilate any strictures, (2) to divert the bile

away from the site of defect in the bile wall, (3) to drain
thoroughly any collections and (4) to seal the tract if possi￾ble. Generally the option of treatment of biliary leaks fol￾lows the indication according to Nagano et al.’s [16]
classification: Type A: these leaks are usually self-limiting,
although sometimes ERCP and sphincterotomy may be
required. Type B and C can be managed by ERCP and
plastic stents combined with percutaneous drainage of the

bile collection. Type D: require surgery and bilioenteric
anastomosis or, if the draining segment is small, fibrin glue
occlusion or acetic acid ablation. Sometimes operative ex￾cision of the excluded segment may be required.
Usually a cholangiogram through the T-tube confirms the
area of leakage. The T-tube may be exchanged to a large (12
or 14 Fr) locking pigtail, which may be left in situ for
drainage until the fistulous tract is sealed (Fig. 1). In case
of laceration of the ducts of Luscka ducts and concomitant
bile duct obstruction, then dilation of the stenotic tract with
a balloon or a stent might be necessary to heal the leak
(Fig. 2). If laceration of large-calibre bile ducts occurred,
then percutaneous drainage of the biloma for 2–3 weeks is
suggested and eventual surgical repair of the leaking site is
suggested (Fig. 3).
In case of bilio-vascular fistulas embolisation with a
variety of embolic agents may be performed (Fig. 4). If
there is a fistula of the bile ducts with the hepatic artery,
then biliary or arterial approach may be performed in order
to embolise the fistulous tract. In such cases, patency of the
portal vein needs to be checked, otherwise liver failure may
be caused. The suggested embolic is a coil or micro-coil. In
case of a biliary approach, antibiotics need to be adminis￾tered due to the risk of abscess formation (Fig. 5).
In case of a free leak, a covered stent may also be used and
then retrieved percutaneously. Gwon et al. [39] in a series of
11 patients with leaks after bilio-digestive anastomoses re￾moved the covered stents after a mean time of 31 days and
did not notice any recurrence in the 1 year follow-up.
In case of “major” bile duct injuries, with complete
transection, bile leakage, local fluid collection and inflam￾mation surgical repair is extremely challenging, especially
due to the compromise clinical conditions of the patient with
fever, abdominal pain and bile fluid collection into the
peritoneal cavity. In such cases, a radiological and endo￾scopic “rendezvous” may be performed in the first instance
(Fig. 6). Fiocca et al. [40] described the results of this
technique has been described in a study of 22 patients with
complete transection of the common bile duct after chole￾cystectomy. This study showed that after a mean follow-up
period of 4 years 16 patients were still asymptomatic and
only four patients undergone surgery.
Outcomes, complications and follow-up
Recurrence of benign stenosis after cholangioplasty may be
due to chronic inflammation or possibly to poor stricture
compliance owing to an elastic component in the scar tissue.
In most series success is defined as the absence of symptoms
following stent removal with normal bilirubin and alkaline
phosphatase levels. Success rates ranging from 70 % to
100 % at a mean follow-up of 23–59 months (range 6–
78 months) have been reported in the literature [13, 28,
31, 35]. However, a lower success rate (55 %) is reported
in series with longer follow-up (5–7.5 years) [41, 42].
Most early procedure-related complications are asso￾ciated with the trans-hepatic approach. Vascular compli￾cations have been reported in 2–20 % of patients
undergoing percutaneous biliary puncture, in most cases
resulting in transient haemobilia not requiring blood
transfusion or intervention [43, 44]. Major complications
are: septic shock (1.2 %) [43], septicaemia (5 %) [45]
and haemorrhage requiring transfusion or hepatic artery
embolisation (4 %) [36]. Episodes of cholangitis can
occur while the stent is in place (1/17 cases) or after
it has been removed (2/17 cases), and have been treated
with intravenous antibiotics [29].
