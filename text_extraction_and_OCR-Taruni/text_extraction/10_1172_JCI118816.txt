Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) potently stimu￾lates angiogenesis, whereas TNF-a has both pro- and anti￾angiogenic activity. By measuring thymidine uptake, we
found that TNF-a blocked a 2.3-fold increase in DNA syn￾thesis induced by VEGF in human endothelial cells. To ex￾plore the possibility that the two interact to regulate endo￾thelial cell proliferation, we examined the effect of TNF-a
on VEGF receptor expression. In venous and arterial endo￾thelial cells, TNF-a potently reduced mRNA transcripts of
the two VEGF receptors (KDR/flk-1 and flt-1) in a dose￾and time-dependent fashion. TNF-a at 1 ng/ml induced max￾imal inhibition of mRNA expression, which fell by z 70%
after 24 h. TNF-a treatment did not significantly affect the
KDR/flk-1 half-life but did decrease its rate of transcription
to 40% of control. The decrease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA de￾pended partially on new protein synthesis and was abol￾ished by phorbol ester pretreatment. TNF-a decreased the
amount of 35S-labeled KDR/flk-1 immunoprecipitated by an
antibody specific for KDR/flk-1 to 18% of control. We con￾clude that TNF-a downregulates expression of both VEGF
receptors in human endothelial cells and that this effect is
transcriptional (at least for KDR/flk-1). These data support
the hypothesis that TNF-a exerts its antiangiogenic effect in
part by modulating the VEGF-specific angiogenic pathway.

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from existing
vessels, is essential for normal development and physiologic
processes such as bone remodeling and the menstrual cycle;
moreover, it is a critical component of a variety of common
disease processes including tumor growth and metastasis, vas￾cular disease, ocular neovascularization, and inflammatory ar￾thritis (1). Inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo blocks tumor
growth (2) and arrests progression of retinopathy (3) in exper￾imental models. Conversely, therapeutic enhancement of an￾giogenesis has been proposed as a treatment for peripheral
vascular disease (4).
A number of growth factors and cytokines regulate angio￾genesis positively or negatively (5). Among these, only vascu￾lar endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1
 has a pattern of expres￾sion that would suggest a specific angiogenic function in
normal development (6). VEGF is a potent mitogen (7, 8) that
promotes the growth and maintenance of vascular endothelial
cells and the development of new blood vessels through inter￾actions with its endothelial cell-specific receptors KDR/flk-1
and flt-1 (9–11). Moreover, the spatial and temporal expres￾sion of VEGF during embryogenesis implies a critical role for
VEGF in the differentiation of endothelial cells from heman￾gioblasts during the earliest stages of vascular development
(12, 13).
In contrast, TNF-a, an inflammation- and neoplasia-associ￾ated cytokine that alters expression of many genes (14), can
promote or inhibit endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis
depending on the system under study (5, 15). In the rabbit cor￾nea (16) and in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (17), TNF-a
induces new vessel growth, possibly by stimulating stromal
or inflammatory cells to release angiogenic mediators. TNF-a
itself stimulates chemotaxis in bovine capillary endothelial
cells (17) and induces autophosphorylation of the receptor ty￾rosine kinase Eck, a likely mediator of angiogenic signaling, in
human endothelial cells (18). In contrast, TNF-a impairs endo￾thelial cell growth in vitro (19) and tumor cell mediated angio￾genesis (20). Endothelial cell growth induced by basic fibro￾blast growth factor is markedly inhibited by TNF-a (16), as is
endothelial monolayer integrity (21). The varied effects of
TNF-a on endothelial cells and new vessel growth suggest the
presence of more than one angiogenic signaling pathway and
that TNF-a, in contrast with VEGF, may have different
actions on endothelial cells depending on the biological con￾text (15).
Because TNF-a has varied and contrasting effects on an￾giogenesis, we explored the possibility that TNF-a interacts di￾rectly with the well-defined and specific VEGF system. We
demonstrate that TNF-a potently inhibits VEGF-induced en￾dothelial cell proliferation and that this inhibition is accompa￾nied by downregulation of the mRNAs for KDR/flk-1 and flt-1,
the two endothelial cell-specific receptors for VEGF. We also
show for KDR/flk-1 that this downregulation is transcription￾Address correspondence to Dr. Edgar Haber, Cardiovascular Biol￾ogy Laboratory, Harvard School of Public Health, 677 Huntington

Methods
Cell culture and mRNA isolation. Primary culture human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic endothelial cells
(HAEC) were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) and
were grown in M199 medium supplemented with 20% FCS (Hy￾Clone, Logan, UT), 30 mg endothelial cell growth supplement (Col￾laborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), 25 mg heparin, 100 U of peni￾cillin/ml, and 100 mg of streptomycin/ml in gelatin-coated tissue
culture plates. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cul￾tured in DME (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with
10% FCS. Primary culture cells were passaged every 4–6 d and exper￾iments were performed on cells three to six passages from primary
culture. After the cells had grown to confluence, they were placed in
quiescence medium (M199 medium supplemented with 5% FCS
without endothelial cell growth supplement). Total RNA from cells
in culture was prepared by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction
and centrifugation through cesium chloride (22). Recombinant hu￾man TNF-a was obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), pyrroli￾dine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), dexamethasone, indomethacin, and
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO), dibutyryl-cyclic AMP from Calbiochem-Behring
Corp. (San Diego, CA), and recombinant human VEGF from Collab￾orative Biomedical. Recombinant human TGF-b1 was provided by
Bristol-Myers Squibb (Seattle, WA).
Northern analysis. RNA blots were hybridized as described (23).
Total RNA (10 mg) from cells in culture was fractionated on a 1.3%
formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters.
cDNA probes were labeled with 32P by random priming and used to
hybridize filters. Filters were then washed and autoradiographed for
4–8 h on Kodak XAR film at 2808C. Filters were stripped of radioac￾tive probe in a 50% formamide solution at 808C and rehybridized
with an end-labeled 18S ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide to correct
for loading (24). Filters were scanned and radioactivity was measured
on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software (Molecular
Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To correct for differences in RNA load￾ing, the signal intensity for each RNA sample hybridized to cDNA
probes was divided by that for each sample hybridized to the 18S ri￾bosomal probe. For RNA studies, experiments were repeated at least
three times. Representative experiments are shown unless statistical
analysis was necessary, in which case data from multiple experiments
were pooled and expressed as the mean6SEM.
Plasmids. A 567-bp human KDR/flk-1 cDNA fragment was gen￾erated from HUVEC total RNA by the reverse-transcriptase PCR
(22) as described (25). The human flt-1 cDNA clone was generously
provided by Dr. Timothy Quinn (University of California, San Fran￾cisco, CA).
Nuclear run-on analysis. Confluent HUVEC were treated with
vehicle (control) or TNF-a (1 ng/ml) for 18 h. The cells were then
lysed and the nuclei were isolated as described by Perrella et al. (26).
Nuclear suspension (200 ml) was incubated with 0.5 mM each of CTP,
ATP, and GTP and with 250 mCi of 32P-labeled UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol;
DuPont/NEN, Boston, MA). The samples were extracted with phe￾nol/chloroform, precipitated, and resuspended at equal counts/min/
ml in hybridization buffer (15 3 106
 counts/min/ml). Denatured
probes (1 mg) dot blotted onto nitrocellulose filters were hybridized
at 408C for 4 d in the presence of formamide. cDNAs for the KDR/
flk-1 and b-actin genes were used as probes. The filters were scanned
and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the
ImageQuant software. The amount of sample hybridizing to the
KDR/flk-1 probe was divided by that hybridizing to the b-actin
probe, and the corrected density was reported as the percentage
change from control.
Immunoprecipitation. HUVEC in confluent monolayers were
made quiescent and treated with TNF-a (1 ng/ml) or vehicle for 24 h.
The cells were incubated with [35S]methionine (100 mCi/ml; DuPont/
NEN) for 2 h and lysed in RIPA buffer at 48C for 10 min. After sedi￾mentation of the insoluble fraction, the protein extract was cleared
with protein A Sepharose (0.1 mg/ml; Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,
NJ) for 1 h at 48C followed by centrifugation and collection of the su￾pernatant. Protein concentrations in the whole cell lysates were de￾termined by a modified Lowry procedure (DC protein assay; Bio￾Rad, Melville, NY) and were confirmed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel
fractionation of samples, followed by Coomassie blue staining.
Protein samples (500 mg) were diluted to 1 mg/ml with immuno￾precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5
mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide) plus 4 mg/ml BSA and
rocked gently at 48C for 1 h. Specific antibody was added to a concen￾tration of 50 ng/ml and the sample was rocked at 48C for 1.5 h. Protein
A Sepharose (10 mg) was then added and rocking was allowed to con￾tinue for another 1.5 h. The antigen–antibody-protein A Sepharose
conjugates were removed by centrifugation and washed four times
with immunoprecipitation buffer. The conjugates were denatured at
1008C for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and size-fractionated on a 7%
SDS–polyacrylamide gel, which was then vacuum dried and autora￾diographed. Autoradiograms were scanned (Scanmaster 31; How￾tek, Hudson, NH) into Adobe Photoshop 3.0, and Scion Image 1.55
was used to quantitate immunoprecipitated protein.
[
3H]Thymidine incorporation. HUVEC grown to near conflu￾ence in gelatin-coated 24-well tissue culture plates were made quies￾cent and treated with vehicle or TNF-a (1 ng/ml) for 12 h before addi￾tion of VEGF (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Cells were treated with VEGF
for 24 h and labeled with [methyl￾3H]thymidine (DuPont/NEN) at 1
mCi/ml during the last 3 h of VEGF treatment. After labeling, the
cells were washed with PBS and fixed in cold 10% TCA, and then
washed with 95% ethanol. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted
in 0.2 M NaOH and measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Values
were expressed as the mean6SEM from six wells from two separate
experiments.
Statistical analysis. When appropriate, data from image analyses
and [3H]thymidine incorporation were expressed as the mean6SEM.
Simple linear regression analysis was performed on data from mRNA
half-life studies by the least squares method. For multiple treatment
groups, a factorial ANOVA followed by Fisher’s least significant
difference test was applied. Statistical significance was accepted at
P , 0.05.
Results
Effect of TNF-a on VEGF-induced endothelial cell prolifera￾tion. TNF-a blunts the mitogenic action of acidic and basic fi￾broblast growth factors on bovine aortic endothelial cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (16). To determine whether
TNF-a also blocks the proliferative effect of VEGF on human
endothelial cells, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation as
a marker of DNA synthesis after stimulating HUVEC with hu￾man recombinant VEGF. In quiescent HUVEC, pretreatment
with TNF-a alone (1 ng/ml) at a concentration similar to that
tested by Frater-Schroder et al. (16) decreased [3H]thymidine
incorporation only slightly in comparison with HUVEC pre￾treated with vehicle (Fig. 1). (At 1 ng/ml, TNF-a has a minimal
cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells in culture [16, 17].) VEGF
treatment alone (10 ng/ml) enhanced [3H]thymidine incorpo￾ration in HUVEC by 2.3-fold in comparison with control cells,
as has been demonstrated in endothelial cells of bovine origin
(8). However, pretreatment of HUVEC with TNF-a totally
abolished the effect of VEGF on DNA synthesis. These results
demonstrate that TNF-a blocked the proliferative response of
HUVEC to VEGF, as it does for fibroblast growth factors. Be￾cause little is known about the regulation of VEGF receptor

expression in endothelial cells, we next examined whether this
alteration in VEGF signaling by TNF-a was due at least in part
to regulation by TNF-a of KDR/flk-1 and flt-1.
TNF-a downregulates VEGF receptor mRNAs. We have
shown that the 5.7-kb KDR/flk-1 mRNA is expressed constitu￾tively in HUVEC (25). Here we demonstrate that the 7.0-kb
flt-1 mRNA is also abundantly expressed by HUVEC in cul￾ture. Treatment of HUVEC with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) resulted in
a decrease in the message for both receptors that was evident
by 6 h. Messenger RNA levels reached 28 and 33% of 0-h val￾ues, respectively, for KDR/flk-1 and flt-1 after 24 h of treat￾ment (Fig. 2 A). That this effect was due to TNF-a alone and
not to the state of quiescence was demonstrated by including a
control sample which had been made quiescent for 24 h and
treated with vehicle alone; quiescence did not decrease the
KDR/flk-1 or flt-1 message. To exclude the possibility that
downregulation of the two receptors was due to a generalized
decrease in mRNA production induced by TNF-a, we hybrid￾ized the same blots to a human heparin-binding EGF–like
growth factor (HB-EGF) probe. Under these conditions,
TNF-a induced a biphasic increase in HB-EGF message (data
not shown), consistent with the results of our previous experi￾ments (24). To demonstrate that the effect of TNF-a was not
specific to endothelial cells of venous origin, we then per￾formed identical experiments in HAEC (Fig. 2 B). A similar,
potent decrease in the message for both receptors was seen in
HAEC. TNF-a also decreased KDR/flk-1 message levels in
bovine aortic endothelial cells (data not shown), demonstrat￾ing that the effect of TNF-a was not species specific.
TNF-a decreased KDR/flk-1 and flt-1 mRNAs in a dose￾dependent fashion (Fig. 3). As little as 1 ng/ml TNF-a inhib￾ited expression of the two mRNAs to nearly maximal levels in
HUVEC. We conclude from the data presented in Figs. 2 and
3 that TNF-a specifically downregulated the mRNA for the
VEGF receptors KDR/flk-1 and flt-1 in a time- and dose-depen￾dent fashion in human endothelial cells.
TNF-a decreases the rate of transcription but not the half￾life of KDR/flk-1. To determine whether TNF-a affected the
steady-state level of KDR/flk-1 mRNA by increasing its rate
of degradation, we measured KDR/flk-1 mRNA in the pres￾ence of actinomycin D (5 mg/ml) in HUVEC. The KDR/flk-1
mRNA half-life was 1.9 h in the absence of TNF-a and in￾creased slightly to 2.6 h after treatment with TNF-a (1 ng/ml)
for 12 h (Fig. 4), an insignificant difference. In similar experi￾ments, TNF-a did not decrease the flt-1 mRNA half-life (data
not shown). Thus, the TNF-a–induced decrease in the level of
KDR/flk-1 and flt-1 mRNAs in HUVEC was not due to a de￾crease in the stability of the mRNA. Because this similarity in
regulation between the two VEGF receptors argued for a
common mechanism, we limited further characterization of
regulation to KDR/flk-1.
We performed nuclear run-on experiments to determine
the rate of KDR/flk-1 gene transcription in the presence or ab￾sence of TNF-a and compared that to the rate of transcription
of the constitutively expressed b-actin gene. In a representa￾Figure 1. Effect of

TNF-a (10 ng/ml), and total RNA was extracted from the cells at the 
indicated times. RNA was also extracted from control cells receiving 
vehicle but not TNF-a. Northern blot analysis was performed with 10 
mg of total RNA/lane. After electrophoresis the RNA was trans￾ferred to nitrocellulose filters, which were sequentially hybridized to 
32P-labeled human KDR/flk-1 and flt-1 probes. The filters were also 
hybridized with an 18S probe to assess loading differences. The cor￾rected density was plotted as a percentage of the 0-h value. (B)

tive experiment (of three), TNF-a (1 ng/ml) decreased the rate
of KDR/flk-1 gene transcription (measured in PhosphorIm￾ager units) to 40% of base line but had no effect on the tran￾scription of b-actin (Fig. 5). Thus, the TNF-a–induced de￾crease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA was due to a decrease in the rate
of transcription of the KDR/flk-1 gene in HUVEC and not to a
change in the stability of its mRNA.
Decrease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA by TNF-a depends on pro￾tein synthesis. To determine whether the decrease in KDR/
flk-1 mRNA required protein synthesis, we pretreated HUVEC
with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin at a concentra￾tion (50 mM) five times higher than that which inhibited pro￾tein synthesis by . 95% (as measured by [3H]leucine uptake,
data not shown). Anisomycin alone had little effect on KDR/
flk-1 expression at this dose (Fig. 6). However, pretreatment
with anisomycin significantly blunted the effect of TNF-a on
KDR/flk-1 expression in comparison with control (35 vs. 71%
decrease, P , 0.05), indicating that the effect of TNF-a on
KDR/flk-1 in HUVEC was at least partly dependent on new
protein synthesis. These results did not vary with the protein
synthesis inhibitor used, as cycloheximide caused an identical
inhibition of the TNF-a effect (data not shown).
Phorbol ester inhibits TNF-a–induced downregulation of
KDR/flk-1 mRNA. To define further the signaling path￾way(s) responsible for downregulation of KDR/flk-1 by TNF-a,
we treated HUVEC with agents that antagonize the effects of
TNF-a on gene expression: TPA (27, 28), dexamethasone (29),
indomethacin (30), dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (31, 32), PDTC (33),
and TGF-b1 (26). Dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, TGF-b1, the antioxi￾dant PDTC, dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid), and in￾domethacin (a prostaglandin synthase inhibitor) did not inhibit
downregulation of KDR/flk-1 mRNA by TNF-a (Fig. 7). In
contrast, phorbol ester treatment (TPA, 100 nM) for 24 h

details.

Total RNA was extracted from the cells at the indicated times after 
actinomycin D administration. Northern blot analyses were per￾formed with 10 mg of total RNA/lane. After transfer, the nitrocellu￾lose filter was hybridized to 32P-labeled human KDR/flk-1 and 18S 
probes. To correct for differences in loading, the signal density of 
each RNA sample hybridized to the KDR/flk-1 probe was divided by 
that hybridized to the 18S probe. The corrected density was then plot￾ted as a percentage of the 0-h value (in log scale) against time. A rep￾resentative of three independent experiments is shown.

moderately upregulated basal KDR/flk-1 mRNA expression
and abolished the downregulation induced by TNF-a (Fig. 7).
TNF-a decreases new KDR/flk-1 protein synthesis. We pre￾cipitated 35S-labeled HUVEC lysates to demonstrate the pro￾duction of immunoreactive KDR/flk-1 protein by HUVEC
and to determine whether the decrease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA
was accompanied by a decrease in protein synthesis. A rabbit
anti-human KDR/flk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz sc-504) immuno￾precipitated a single species with a molecular mass of approxi￾mately 205 kD (Fig. 8), consistent with the size of full-length
KDR/flk-1 protein when expressed in and immunoprecipi￾tated from NIH 3T3 or COS7 cells (2, 34). An identically sized
species was detected by an antibody raised against a different
KDR/flk-1 epitope (Santa Cruz sc-505) but not by a rabbit an￾tibody raised similarly to the transcription factor Sp1 (data not
shown), demonstrating the specificity of this interaction. After
24 h of TNF-a treatment, 35S-labeled KDR/flk-1 protein levels
decreased to 18% of control (Fig. 8), confirming that the de￾crease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA induced by TNF-a was accompa￾nied by a similar decrease in KDR/flk-1 protein expression.
Discussion
Despite the importance of angiogenesis in development and
disease, the mitogenic, chemotactic, and morphogenetic mech￾anisms by which new vessels form are only beginning to be un￾derstood. Deletion of the KDR/flk-1 gene by homologous re￾combination in mice abolishes vasculogenesis and endothelial
cell formation, indicating that the VEGF system is essential for
endothelial cells to differentiate from hemangioblastic precur￾sors (35). Moreover, in addition to its involvement in angio￾genesis and endothelial cell differentiation, VEGF prevents
regression of newly formed vessels in vivo, which suggests that
VEGF is an important endothelial cell survival factor (36).
However, it remains unclear what other factors interact with
VEGF to regulate angiogenesis and by what pathways these
effects are exerted.
We examined the interaction between TNF-a and the
VEGF/VEGF receptor system in human endothelial cells, and
we show that TNF-a blocked DNA synthesis induced by
VEGF (Fig. 1), as it blocked DNA synthesis induced by fibro￾blast growth factor (16). Further, we demonstrate that TNF-a
directly interacted with the VEGF system by downregulating
the VEGF receptors KDR/flk-1 and flt-1 in a dose- and time￾dependent fashion (Figs. 2 and 3). Because not much is known
about the regulation of the VEGF receptors, we explored the
mechanism by which TNF-a downregulated KDR/flk-1. We
found that TNF-a decreased the rate of transcription of the
KDR/flk-1 gene but had little effect on its mRNA half-life
(Figs. 4 and 5). Moreover, we show that new protein synthesis

(INDO, 10 mM), dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP, 100 mM), PDTC 
(100 mM), or TGF-b1 (10 ng/ml), and then treated with TNF-a (1 ng/

end of each incubation. A representative of three experiments is

was necessary for complete downregulation of KDR/flk-1
mRNA by TNF-a (Fig. 6). That inhibition of protein synthesis
only partially attenuated KDR/flk-1 mRNA downregulation
suggests that transcriptional regulation of this gene by TNF-a
may be mediated through a multiprotein complex, as is the
case for TNF-a–regulated vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
expression or transcription in endothelial cells (37, 38).
To delineate pathways responsible for the effect of TNF-a
on transcription of the KDR/flk-1 gene, we examined the ef￾fects of agents known to modulate transcriptional responses of
TNF-a (Fig. 7). Of these agents, only TPA abolished downreg￾ulation of KDR/flk-1 mRNA expression by TNF-a. Phorbol
esters such as TPA have pleiomorphic effects on cell growth
and gene expression (39). In contrast, neither dexamethasone,
a glucocorticoid with multiple effects including inhibition of
AP-1 and NFkB activation by TNF-a (40, 41), nor PDTC, an
antioxidant and suppressor of NFkB activity in endothelial
cells after TNF-a stimulation (33), prevented TNF-a–induced
downregulation of KDR/flk-1 mRNA. This contrast (Fig. 7)
would indicate that the effect of TNF-a on KDR/flk-1 gene
regulation is independent of intracellular signaling pathways
blocked by PDTC or dexamethasone and is mediated by path￾ways sensitive to phorbol ester.
TNF-a increases expression of a variety of genes (14), as
would befit a central mediator of the inflammatory process,
and AP-1 and NFkB complexes are by far the most commonly
identified trans-acting factors that mediate this process (42–
44). Although the transcriptional downregulation by TNF-a of
KDR/flk-1 gene expression is rare (Fig. 7), it is not without
precedent. TNF-a downregulates transcription of thrombo￾modulin in endothelial cells by an undefined mechanism (45),
and TNF-a inhibits vitamin D–induced transcription of the rat
osteocalcin gene in osteoblastic cells through interactions that
do not involve AP-1 or NFkB binding sites (46, 47). TNF-a
also induces binding of an inhibitory protein complex to cis￾acting elements in the a2(I) collagen gene in human fibroblasts
(48). This protein complex has not been identified; however, it
does not include immunoreactive AP-1 or NFkB members.
In light of the foregoing observations, our finding that AP-1
and NFkB activities are not likely to mediate the regulatory ef￾fects of TNF-a on KDR/flk-1 mRNA expression suggests that
novel trans-acting factors mediate the inhibitory effects of
TNF-a on expression of genes such as those encoding a2(I)
collagen, osteocalcin, and the VEGF receptors. To search for
these factors, we have examined the effect of TNF-a on re￾porter gene expression under control of 4 kb of 59 flanking se￾quence of the KDR/flk-1 gene (which contains two consensus
NFkB binding sites [25]) in transient transfection assays of bo￾vine aortic endothelial cells (data not shown). Because we
have not discovered TNF-a–responsive cis-acting elements
within this 59 flanking sequence, we speculate that TNF-a ex￾erts its transcriptional effects on KDR/flk-1 through DNA ele￾ments outside the cloned 59 flanking sequence.
As a central regulator of the local inflammatory response,
TNF-a modulates the expression of many genes in endothelial
cells. In particular, TNF-a induces the expression of genes in￾volved in cytoadhesion, thrombosis, and the inflammatory re￾sponse, processes referred to collectively as endothelial activa￾tion (49). Our results demonstrate that in addition to the
transient induction by TNF-a of adhesion molecules and pro￾coagulant factors, TNF-a also induces a dramatic and sus￾tained reduction in VEGF receptor expression as part of the
activation program. Although inhibition of endothelial cell
growth and survival may serve as a brake on the inflammatory
response during the early stages of endothelial activation, this
growth inhibition may contribute to pathophysiologic re￾sponses in the later stages of cytokine-mediated diseases. For
example, in septic shock, neutrophil- and lymphocyte-medi￾ated endothelial cell injury and loss of monolayer integrity may
go unrepaired, which in turn would accelerate vascular leakage
and increase leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial surface
long after the initial infectious insult had subsided (50, 51).
Our data indicate that TNF-a may exert its antiangiogenic
effects at least partly by decreasing synthesis of VEGF recep￾tors. The recent discovery that TNF-a and VEGF induce an￾giogenesis through two distinct aV integrin–mediated path￾ways is therefore of particular interest (52). Our findings raise
the possibility that a factor from one such pathway with bifunc￾tional angiogenic activity (TNF-a) may actually inhibit the ef￾fects of VEGF in vivo by acting through the other pathway. It
is therefore tempting to speculate that the two aV integrin–
mediated pathways subserve angiogenesis in divergent physio￾logic roles (for example, inflammatory versus developmental).
Clearly, a complete elucidation of the interaction between an￾giogenic factors such as TNF-a and VEGF will be necessary
before these pathways and the physiologic processes they me￾diate are fully understood.
