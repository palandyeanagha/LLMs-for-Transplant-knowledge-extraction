Abstract
Introduction: Calciphylaxis occurring after kidney transplantation is rare and rarely reported. It
results in chronic non-healing wounds and is associated with a poor prognosis and is often fatal.
We present a case of proximal lower limb calciphylaxis that occurred early after kidney
transplantation. The patient had no classic associated risk factors. He had previously had a total
parathyroidectomy but had normal serum calcium-phosphate product and parathyroid hormone
levels. The clinical outcome of this case was favorable and highlights some fundamental issues
relating to management.
Case presentation: A 70-year-old British Caucasian man with end-stage renal failure secondary
to IgA nephropathy presented six months post kidney transplantation with cutaneous calciphylaxis
lesions involving the medial aspect of the thigh bilaterally.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of rapid onset cutaneous
calciphylaxis occurring soon after kidney transplantation that was associated with a favorable
outcome. Cutaneous calciphylaxis lesions should be promptly managed with meticulous wound
care, antimicrobial therapy and the correction of calcium-phosphate product where indicated.
Introduction
Calciphylaxis or calcific uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA) is
a disease that involves calcium deposition in the walls of
small- and medium-sized arteries with consequent ischae￾mic necrosis and gangrene of the supplying tissue. This
condition was first described in the dialysis population
[1] and contrary to its name, is not exclusive to uraemic
patients but may occur in nonuraemic conditions such as
primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, alcoholic liver
disease, connective tissue disease, diabetes mellitus,
Crohn's disease and corticosteroid use [2]. CUA has a slow
and indolent onset that classically presents in the distal
lower limbs. However, it may occur in any part of the
body, including visceral tissue [3,4]. In general, systemic
calciphylaxis has a poor prognosis and is often fatal. The
pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood but
may involve abnormal calcium phosphate homeostasis.
There are also several recognized risk factors associated
with the development of CUA, such as hyperparathy￾roidism, elevated calcium-phosphate product (multiply￾Published: 24 November 2009

ing serum calcium and phosphate values [normal range
less than 4.5]), diabetes mellitus, obesity, coagulopathies,
warfarin or iron dextran treatment.
There have been a few reported cases of CUA occurring in
patients late after kidney transplantation [4-6]. We
describe an unusual case of rapid onset CUA with super￾imposed infection in a patient six months after kidney
transplantation but with normal serum calcium levels
despite having had a total parathyroidectomy.
Case presentation
A 70-year-old British Caucasian man with end stage renal
failure (ESRF) secondary to IgA nephropathy received a
deceased donor kidney transplant on the 14th January
2008. He had been diagnosed with ESRF 15 years previ￾ously, and was initially dialysing via peritoneal dialysis
and later via haemodialysis. At the time of transplant, his
only remaining vascular access was a long-term intrave￾nous catheter. Many years previously he had undergone a
total parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism
and therefore took regular calcium supplements and alfa￾calcidol at a dose of 0.25 μg/day. Both pre- and post-kid￾ney transplant parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum
calcium levels were within normal ranges with a calcium￾phosphate product of less than 4. Post-transplant recovery
was complicated by delayed graft function requiring dial￾ysis for 14 days, transplant wound dehiscence requiring
V.A.C.® dressing, and bladder outflow obstruction requir￾ing intermittent self-catheterization. Despite these com￾plications, he continued to improve with a good urine
output and a glomerular filtration rate of 38.9 ml/min
and was discharged home.
During routine follow-up at the outpatient clinic, the
patient's calcium supplements were modified. He was
admitted four months later with a complaint of sudden
onset of painless lesions bilaterally on the medial aspect
of his thighs. They appeared within the 48 hours prior to
admission and were not associated with a history of
trauma. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH and cal￾cium-phosphate product were found to be normal. Clini￾cally, both lesions were well demarcated, gangrenous in
appearance and foul smelling (Figure 1). Peripheral
pulses were intact. Swabs taken from this lesion grew Pseu￾domonas and coliforms sensitive to meropenem. A wedge
biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of calciphy￾laxis (Figure 2). Intravenous antibiotic was immediately
introduced and all calcium supplements were stopped.
Over a period of one month, the lesions had fully
resolved.
Conclusion
We describe an unusual presentation of proximal lower
limb calciphylaxis with superimposed infection. Interest￾ingly, this patient did not have any of the recognized risk
factors associated with the development of CUA. The clin￾ical outcome in this case has been favorable and empha￾sizes the importance of early diagnosis, aggressive
antimicrobial therapy and wound management. CUA
may present as mild erythematous patches, livido reticu￾laris, painful nodules or necrotic ulcerating lesions, giving
various possible differential diagnoses. Gold standard
treatment for CUA includes diagnostic biopsy to refute
other causes of cutaneous lesions, treatment of hyperpar￾athyroidism, reduction of calcium-phosphate product,
anti-microbial therapy and meticulous wound care. Sev￾eral therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CUA have
been tested including parathyroidectomy, hyperbaric oxy￾gen therapy, sodium thiosulfate infusion, tissue plas￾minogen activator and bisphosphonates but none have
shown any consistent benefit [7]. Cinacalcet has been

anaesthetically unfit for parathyroidectomy. It inhibits
PTH release and has been shown to be effective in the
treatment of CUA in cases where PTH levels were found to
be high (secondary hyperparathyroidism) [8,9]. In gen￾eral, CUA is associated with a poor prognosis if not aggres￾sively managed.
