Background Well-defined guidelines for the treatment of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients 
with cirrhosis are lacking, given the paucity of robust data. Among the available treatment options 
the best choice is unknown.
Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple electronic databases and conference 
proceedings (through December 2019) to identify studies that reported on the use of anticoagulants 
in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. Our goals were to evaluate the pooled odds 
ratio (OR) and pooled rate of treatment responders and bleeding events.
Results A total of 17 studies were included: 648 patients were treated with anticoagulation 
and 96 were controls. Pooled OR for treatment responders was 5.1 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 2.5-10.2, P  =  0.001) and pooled OR for bleeding was 0.4  (95%CI 0.1-1.5, P  =  0.2) 
for anticoagulation treatment versus control. Pooled rate of treatment responders with 
anticoagulation was 66.7% (95%CI 58.3-74.1) compared to 26% (95%CI 14.2-42.7) for the 
control group. Pooled rate of bleeding seemed comparable (7.8%, 95%CI 4.5-13.3, and 15.4%, 
95%CI 4.3-42.7). On subgroup analysis, pooled rates of treatment responders and bleeding 
events seemed similar between low molecular weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and 
direct oral anticoagulants.
Conclusions Our study demonstrated that anticoagulation is effective and safe in the treatment of 
PVT in patients with cirrhosis. Owing to the comparable outcomes, direct oral anticoagulants may 
be considered as first-line treatment, depending on patient preferences.

Introduction
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is defined as a clot within 
the portal vein trunk and/or its intrahepatic branches, the 
mesenteric vein, the hepatic veins and the splenic veins. PVT 
can be completely or partially occlusive and can be a life￾threatening event if it extends into the superior mesenteric 
vein [1,2]. Although the impact of PVT on the natural history 
of patients with cirrhosis is not well established, some evidence 
suggests that PVT may contribute to a poor prognosis in 
patients undergoing liver transplantation [3].
The natural course of untreated PVT is not known. 
Several studies have shown spontaneous resolution and/or 
no change in 30-75% of cases, and worsening in most of the 
remainder [4]. Evidence suggests that a majority of these 
patients will benefit from some form of anticoagulation.

Abstract

2 B. P. Mohan et al
Annals of Gastroenterology 33
Robust data on the optimal management of PVT in patients 
with cirrhosis are lacking and current guidelines do not 
propose definitive evidence-based treatment strategies [3]. 
The best choice of anticoagulation is unknown in cirrhotic 
patients with PVT.
The classes of anticoagulant therapy for PVT in cirrhosis 
are vitamin K antagonists (VKA), low molecular weight 
heparin (LMWH), and, to a lesser extent, direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOAC). DOAC in this context have been used 
in an “off-label” manner and current evidence is limited on 
its use in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. We 
conducted this meta-analysis to update our knowledge of the 
use of anticoagulation in PVT patients with cirrhosis, focusing 
particularly on evidence concerning the use of DOAC.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases 
and conference proceedings, including PubMed, EMBASE, 
Google-Scholar, LILACS and Web of Science databases 
(earliest inception to December 2019). We followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta￾Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational 
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [5,6], by 
using a predefined protocol to identify studies reporting on 
the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. PRISMA 
and MOOSE checklists are provided in Appendices 2 and 3 
respectively.
An experienced medical librarian helped with the 
literature search, using inputs from the study authors. The 
detailed search strategy is provided in Appendix1. Three 
authors (BPM, VM, SRK) independently reviewed the title 
and abstract of studies identified in the primary search and 
excluded studies that did not address the research question, 
based on pre-specified exclusion and inclusion criteria. The 
full text of the remaining articles was reviewed to determine 
whether it contained relevant information. Any discrepancy in 
article selection was resolved by consensus and in discussion 
with a co-author.
The bibliographic section of the selected articles, as well as 
the systematic and narrative articles on the topic were manually 
searched for additional relevant articles.
Study selection
In this meta-analysis, we included studies that evaluated 
the performance of anticoagulants in the treatment of 
PVT in patients with cirrhosis. Studies were included 
irrespectively of the site of thrombus (main portal vein 
and/or branches, main mesenteric vein and/or branches, 
main hepatic vein and/or branches, and main splenic vein 
and/or branches), inpatient/outpatient setting, geography, 
and abstract/manuscript status, as long as they provided 
data needed for the analysis. Special attention was focused 
on data pertaining to patency of the portal vein and its 
branches, the mesenteric vein, splenic veins, and hepatic 
veins.
Patients treated with VKA were pre-treated with LMWH for 
5-7 days and/or until the international normalized ratio (INR) 
increased at least to 2.0. The dose of VKA was adjusted to a 
target INR of 2.0-3.0. LMWH was administered at a treatment 
dose of 1  mg/kg body weight subcutaneously. Danaparoid 
sodium (Orgaran; MSD, Tokyo, Japan) was administered as 
intravenous drip infusion at a dose of 2500 units/day for a total 
of 2 weeks.
Response to treatment was assessed by the change in 
diameter of the thrombus at scheduled follow up. Complete 
resolution was defined as disappearance of all evidence 
of thrombosis, determined by transverse computed 
tomography (CT). Partial resolution was defined as at least 
a 30% reduction in the long diameter of the main thrombus 
and/or 50% reduction in the cross-sectional area, without 
evidence of appearance of new thrombi. Patients with partial 
or complete resolution were considered as responders to 
treatment.
Clinically significant bleeding was defined based on 
the location of critical organs—cranium, spine, ocular, 
retroperitoneal, pericardial, urinary tract, and intramuscular 
with compartment syndrome—along with a decrease in 
hemoglobin level ≥2  g/dL and the need for transfusion of 
blood products.
Our study’s exclusion criteria included: 1) studies 
with underlying hepatocellular carcinoma and/or 
metastases; 2) studies with other malignancy-related 
PVT; 3) studies reporting on arterial thrombosis; 4) studies 
reporting on patients with underlying thrombogenic 
hematologic disorders unrelated to cirrhosis; 5) studies on 
patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome; 6) studies reporting on 
patients with prior trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic 
shunt procedure; 7) studies with a sample size <10 patients; 8) 
studies in a pediatric population (age <18 years); and 9) studies 
published in a language other than English.
In case of multiple publications from the same cohort or 
overlapping cohorts, data from the most recent and/or most 
appropriate comprehensive report were included. PVT was 
diagnosed by helical CT and/or Doppler ultrasonography. 
Angiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging was used as 
and when needed to confirm a doubtful diagnosis.
Data abstraction and quality assessment
Data on study-related outcomes in the individual studies 
were abstracted onto a standardized form by at least 2 authors 
(VM, SRK), and 2 authors (BPM, SRK) did the quality scoring 
independently. Data from randomized trials and case-control 
studies were calculated as number of reported events (n) out 
of total number of patients (N) from each study. Since the 
collected data were treated in similar fashion to those from 

Anticoagulation therapy of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis 3
Annals of Gastroenterology 33
single-group cohort studies, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa
scale to assess the quality of studies [7]. The details are given in 
Supplementary Table 1.
Outcomes assessed
Pooled rate of treatment responders, anticoagulation 
versus control, and pooled rate of bleeding, anticoagulation 
versus control. Subgroup analysis was based on the type of 
anticoagulant (VKA, LMWH or DOAC).
Statistical analysis
We used meta-analysis techniques to calculate the pooled 
estimates in each case, following the random-effects model. 
When the incidence of an outcome was zero in a study, a 
continuity correction of 0.5 was added to the number of 
incident cases before statistical analysis [8]. We assessed 
heterogeneity between study-specific estimates using the 
Cochran Q statistical test for heterogeneity [9,10] and the I2
statistic [11,12]. In this test, values of <30%, 30-60%, 61-75% 
and >75% were suggestive of low, moderate, substantial and 
considerable heterogeneity, respectively [13]. Publication 
bias was ascertained qualitatively, by visual inspection of a 
funnel plot, and quantitatively, by the Egger test [14]. When 
publication bias was present, further statistics using the fail￾safe N test and Duval and Tweedie’s “Trim and Fill” test was 
used to ascertain the impact of the bias [15]. Three levels of 
impact were reported, based on the concordance between 
the reported results and the actual estimate if there were no 
bias. The impact was reported as minimal if both versions 
were estimated to be the same, modest if effect size changed 
substantially but the final finding would still remain the same, 
and severe if the basic final conclusion of the analysis was 
threatened by the bias [16]. We ran meta-regression analysis 
based on the random-effects Knapp-Hartung method to 
evaluate effects of variables on the analyzed outcomes. All 
analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 
(CMA) software, version 3 (BioStat, Englewood, NJ).
Results
Search results and population characteristics
From an initial total of 1147 studies, 523 records were 
screened and 71 full-length articles were assessed. 17 
studies were included in the final analysis [17-33]. Five 
studies reported on LMWH [17,22,23,25,32], 8 reported on 
VKA [19-21,24,26,27,29,33], and 3 reported on DOAC [26,29,31]. 
Two studies reported anticoagulation in general [18,30], and one 
study used danaparoid alone [28]. Six studies reported on patients 
with PVT who were not treated with anticoagulation and were used 
as the control cohort [20,21,23,25,30,32]. The schematic diagram
of the study selection is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Baseline population characteristics were comparable between 
the VKA, LMWH, DOAC, and control groups. The mean and/or 
median age ranged from 41-71 years, with a predominantly male 
population (70.6%). Alcoholic (45.3%) and viral (40.3%) causes 
of cirrhosis were the most common, followed by autoimmune and 
biliary causes (14.4%). There were 144 patients with Child-Pugh 
A, 182  patients with Child-Pugh B, and 121 with Child-Pugh 
C cirrhosis. The majority of the studies had patients screened 
for esophageal varices before the initiation of anticoagulation. 
Patients with grade II or III esophageal varices were banded and 
anticoagulation initiation was delayed until 15 days after the last 
banding session. Unfortunately, studies did not report uniformly 
on the details of banding prior to anticoagulation initiation. 
The basic study and population characteristics are described in 
Supplementary Table 1.
Characteristics and quality of included studies
Two studies were prospective and the rest were retrospective 
in nature [23,32]. Two were multicenter studies [22,26] and 
the rest were single-centered. None were population-based. 
The details of the quality assessment are summarized in 
Supplementary Table 2. Overall, 8 studies were considered to 
be of high quality [20-24,26,29,32] and the rest were of medium 
quality. There were no low quality studies.
Outcomes
A total of 744 patients were included in the analysis from 
the 17 studies [17-33]. A pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated 
from 6 studies that compared anticoagulation to controls. The 
pooled OR for treatment responders was 5.1 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 2.5-10.2, P=0.001, I2
=13%) (Fig.  1), and the 
pooled OR for bleeding was 0.4  (95%CI 0.1-1.5, P=0.2, 
I2
=0%) (Fig. 2).
The pooled rate of treatment responders was 66.7% 
(95%CI 58.3-74.1, I2
=72.7%) and the pooled rate of treatment 
responders in the control group (no treatment), was 26% 
(95%CI 14.2-42.7, I2
=36.7%) (Supplementary Fig.  2). The 
pooled rate of bleeding with anticoagulation was 7.8% 
(95%CI 4.5-13.3, I2
=66.2%), and the pooled rate of bleeding 
in the control group was 15.4% (95%CI 4.3-42.7, I2
=0%) 
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analysis was based on the anticoagulation type, 
i.e., LMWH, VKA, and DOAC: 155 patients were treated with 
LMWH, 315 with VKA, and 70 with DOAC. The pooled rate of 
treatment response was 60.7% (95%CI 41.5-77.2) for LMWH, 
66% (95%CI 51.1-78.3) for VKA, and 76.7% (95%CI 45.3-92.9) 

4 B. P. Mohan et al
Annals of Gastroenterology 33
for DOAC (Supplementary Fig. 4). The pooled rate of bleeding 
was 7.2% (95%CI 2.1-21.6) for LMWH, 9.3% (95%CI 3.9-20.6) 
for VKA, and 7.9% (95%CI 1.7-29.9) for DOAC (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). These rates appeared comparable (Table 1).
Meta-regression analysis based on Child-Pugh 
classification
Child-Pugh classifications A, B and C did not significantly 
affect the pooled rates of treatment success or the pooled rates 
of bleeding. The calculated 2-sided P-value of the intercept was 
0.39: Child A was 0.15, Child B was 0.11, and Child C was 0.15.
Validation of meta-analysis results
Sensitivity analysis
To assess whether any one study had a dominant effect 
on the meta-analysis, we excluded one study at a time and 
analyzed its effect on the main summary estimate. On this 
analysis, no single study significantly affected the outcome or 
the heterogeneity.
Heterogeneity
We assessed the dispersion of the calculated rates using 
the I2
 percentage values. The pooled OR with treatment 
responders and/or bleeding demonstrated minimal to no 
heterogeneity. The pooled rate of treatment responders with 
anticoagulation demonstrated considerable to moderate 
heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis and subgroup 
analysis did not demonstrate a statistical explanation for the 
observed heterogeneity.
Publication bias
Based on visual inspection of the funnel plot, as well as 
quantitative measurement that used the Egger regression 
test, there was evidence of publication bias. Further statistics

using the fail-safe N test and Duval and Tweedie’s “Trim and 
Fill” test revealed that the impact of the possible publication 
bias appeared to be minimal and would not change the 
calculated estimate or the conclusion of this meta-analysis 
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Discussion
This study demonstrated that the pooled OR of 
treatment response was statistically significant (OR 5.1, 
95%CI 2.5-10.2; P = 0.001) with respect to anticoagulation 
therapy of PVT, as compared to controls, in patients with 
cirrhosis. The pooled OR of bleeding events was 0.4 (95%CI 
0.1-1.5) and was not significant (P  =  0.2). To the best of 
our knowledge, this study is the largest and most current 
review of anticoagulation therapy of PVT in patients with 
cirrhosis.
Our study results add important data to the current 
literature, since this is the first study to analyze the pooled rates 
of DOAC in the treatment of PVT, and the first to analyze the 
effect of Child-Pugh classification on the pooled rates by meta￾regression methods. However, it is important to note that meta￾regression analysis is a weak statistical tool in the assessment 
of a variable’s predictive effects on the pooled outcomes, and 
the result is not in accordance with current clinical experience. 
Anticoagulation is completely different in a well-compensated 
cirrhotic patient compared to a decompensated patient. 
Studies included in this analysis did not specify the treatment 
in relation to the Child score.
The pooled rate of treatment response with anticoagulation 
was 66.7% and the pooled rate in the control group was 26%. 
Based on the subgroup analysis, the pooled rate of treatment 
response was 60.7% for LMWH, 66% for VKA, and 76.7% for 
DOAC. Although our results do not establish causality, they 
clearly indicate that anticoagulation therapy of PVT in patients 
with cirrhosis is more beneficial than no treatment. The 
treatment duration in the studies included ranged from 2 weeks 
in the case of danaparoid followed by VKA to 17 months in the 
case of LMWH. In the case of DOAC the treatment was given 
for 6 months.
Patients with cirrhosis are considered to be more prone 
to develop PVT compared to patients without cirrhosis, 
with a reported incidence in the range of 9-11%, far higher 
than that of the general population [34,35]. Patients with 
advanced liver cirrhosis and PVT tend to have lower activated 
partial thromboplastin time and INR. Apart from deranged 
coagulation parameters, a decreased velocity of portal vein 
flow, with or without flow reversal, seems to be an important 
factor predisposing to thrombus formation [36,37]. Based 
on our results, anticoagulation therapy seems warranted in 
patients with cirrhosis; however, this cannot be generalized 
at present, as there are many different phenotypes of 
cirrhotics and the current major societies differ in their 
opinion.
The pooled rate of bleeding with anticoagulation was 7.8%: 
7.2% with LMWH, 9.3% with VKA, and 7.9% with DOAC. Our 
analysis demonstrated comparable rates of life-threatening 
bleeding events with LMWH, VKA, and DOAC. The majority 
of reported bleeding events, especially variceal, were located 
in the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with high-grade varices 
were typically banded before anticoagulation therapy and 
treatment was typically delayed by 15 days. Variceal bleed with 
any anticoagulation, especially a DOAC, can be potentially life￾threatening. The pooled rate of bleeding in the control group 
was 15.4%.
Although, the United States Food and Drug 
Administration has approved novel antidotes for DOAC, 
they are not widely available for use, especially in resource￾limited settings, because of cost issues. LMWH and/or VKA 
may be a safer option in patients with severe varices, given 
the readily available antidotes. In the studies analyzed, no 
bleeding-related deaths were reported. Based on our meta￾Table 1 Summary of pooled results

regression analysis, Child-Pugh classification for the severity 
of cirrhosis did not seem to influence the measured outcomes. 
Currently, DOAC are not recommended for use in Child￾Pugh C cirrhosis.
Overall, the strengths of this review are the systematic 
literature search with well-defined inclusion criteria, the 
careful exclusion of redundant studies, the inclusion of good 
quality studies with detailed extraction of data, the rigorous 
evaluation of study quality, and the statistics to establish or 
refute the validity of the results of our meta-analysis. Analysis 
of DOAC and meta-regression covariate analysis based on 
the Child-Pugh classification are new additions to the current 
literature.
There were limitations to this study, most of which are 
inherent to any meta-analysis. Our analysis included studies 
retrospective in nature, contributing to selection bias. 
Although the treatment response was high, we were not 
able to specify the magnitude of the treatment in relation 
to the anatomical location of the response, and there was 
no information on portal cavernoma. Heterogeneity was 
noted in the analysis of treatment responders, especially in 
the treatment with VKA. Variability in the time to achieve 
a target INR with VKA is a plausible explanation, along 
with the variability in treatment dosage, duration of heparin 
bridging and differences in anticoagulation medication. 
We were not able to analyze the treatment outcomes based 
on the model for end-stage liver disease score, because of 
the paucity of data. We were not able to evaluate the role 
of β-blockers on primary prevention with PVT and plan for 
anticoagulation.
Our results are comparable with previously conducted 
meta-analyses [38,39], which reported a recanalization rate 
of 66-71% with anticoagulation treatment for PVT in patients 
with cirrhosis with no excess of major or minor bleedings. In 
the study sample of Scheiner et al [31], 70% of the patients had 
non-cirrhotic PVT. Nagaoki et al [29] used a combination of 3 
drugs (danaparoid, ATIII infusion followed by VKA). Hanafy 
et al [26] compared VKA to DOAC in a cohort of patients 
that consisted entirely of acute PVT from splenectomy 
in well-compensated HCV cirrhosis. However, based on 
our sensitivity analysis, we demonstrated that including 
or removing one study at a time did not affect the pooled 
outcomes, so this study is still the best available evidence in 
the literature thus far. Well-conducted randomized studies are 
warranted to better predict the usefulness of LMWH, VKA, 
and DOAC in such patients.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrated that 
anticoagulation therapy of PVT should be considered in 
patients with cirrhosis. The risk of major life-threatening 
bleeding does not seem to be increased in cirrhotic patients 
with PVT treated with anticoagulants, compared to patients 
with no treatment. LMWH, VKA, and DOAC are comparable 
in the resolution of PVT, with a similar risk of life-threatening 
bleeding events. Therefore, DOACs may be used for the 
treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis, based on patient 
preferences and characteristics.

Summary Box
What is already known:
•	 Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is commonly
encountered in patients with cirrhosis and can be 
life-threatening
•	 According to the Baveno VI consensus,
treatment should be considered in potential liver￾transplantation candidates; however, no consensus 
exists for non-transplant candidates
•	 The consensus is based on weak data and the main
concern is the risk of inducing or aggravating a 
life-threatening bleeding episode
•	 Additionally, data on the use of direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) in PVT are limited
What the new findings are:
•	 In this meta-analysis of 17 studies, the pooled odds
ratio (OR) of treatment responders with any form 
of anticoagulation therapy for PVT in cirrhotic 
patients was statistically significant (OR 5.1, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 2.5-10.2; P=0.001), when 
compared to no anticoagulation
•	 The pooled proportion of treatment responders
was 60.7% for low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH), 66% for vitamin K antagonists (VKA), 
and 76.7% for DOACs
•	 The pooled odds ratio (OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.1-1.5;
P=0.2) showed that the bleeding risk in cirrhotic 
patients receiving any form of anticoagulation 
therapy for PVT was comparable to that in patients 
who received no anticoagulation
•	 The pooled bleeding risk seemed comparable for
LMWH, VKAs and DOACs (7.2%, 9.3% and 7.9%, 
respectively)

TITLE
Title 1 Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both. 1
ABSTRACT
Structured summary 2 Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data 
sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and 
synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; 
systematic review registration number. 
3
INTRODUCTION
Rationale 3 Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known. 4
Objectives 4 Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to 
participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS). 
4
METHODS
Protocol and 
registration 
5 Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web 
address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration 
number. 
5
Eligibility criteria 6 Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow up) and report 
characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria 
for eligibility, giving rationale. 
5
Information sources 7 Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with 
study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched. 
5
Search 8 Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits 
used, such that it could be repeated. 
5
Study selection 9 State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in 
systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis). 
5
Data collection process 10 Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, 
in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators. 
6
Data items 11 List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding 
sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made. 
6
Risk of bias in 
individual studies 
12 Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including 
specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this 
information is to be used in any data synthesis. 
8
Summary measures 13 State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means). 
Synthesis of results 14 Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, 
including measures of consistency (e.g., I2
) for each meta-analysis. 
8
Risk of bias across 
studies 
15 Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., 
publication bias, selective reporting within studies). 
10
Additional analyses 16 Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta￾regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified. 
9
RESULTS 
Study selection 17 Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, 
with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram. 
8
Study characteristics 18 For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, 
PICOS, follow up period) and provide the citations. 
8
Risk of bias within 
studies 
19 Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level 
assessment (see item 12). 
8
Results of individual 
studies 
20 For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple 
summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence 
intervals, ideally with a forest plot. 
9
Appendix 2 PRISMA checklist 
(Contd...)

Section/topic # Checklist item Reported on page # 
Synthesis of results 21 Present the main results of the review. If meta-analyses are done, include for each, 
confidence intervals and measures of consistency 
9
Risk of bias across 
studies 
22 Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item 15). 10, supple table-2
Additional analysis 23 Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, 
meta-regression [see Item 16]). 
9
DISCUSSION
Summary of evidence 24 Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main 
outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and 
policy makers). 
11, table-1
Limitations 25 Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level 
(e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias). 
12
Conclusions 26 Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and 
implications for future research. 
13
FUNDING 
Funding 27 Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply 
of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
