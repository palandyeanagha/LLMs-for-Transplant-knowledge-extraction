Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a novel metabolic regulator that represents a promising target for the treatment of
several metabolic diseases. Administration of recombinant wild type FGF21 to diabetic animals leads to a dramatic
improvement in glycaemia and ameliorates other systemic measures of metabolic health. Here we report the
pharmacologic outcomes observed in non-human primates upon administration of a recently described FGF21 analogue,
LY2405319 (LY). Diabetic rhesus monkeys were treated subcutaneously with LY once daily for a period of seven weeks. The
doses of LY used were 3, 9 and 50 mg/kg each delivered in an escalating fashion with washout measurements taken at 2, 4,
6 and 8 weeks following the final LY dose. LY therapy led to a dramatic and rapid lowering of several important metabolic
parameters including glucose, body weight, insulin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels at all doses tested. In addition, we
observed favorable changes in circulating profiles of adipokines, with increased adiponectin and reduced leptin indicative
of direct FGF21 action on adipose tissue. Importantly, and for the first time we show that FGF21 based therapy has
metabolic efficacy in an animal with late stage diabetes. While the glycemic efficacy of LY in this animal was partially
attenuated its lipid lowering effect was fully preserved suggesting that FGF21 may be a viable treatment option even in
patients with advanced disease progression. These findings support continued exploration of the FGF21 pathway for the
treatment of metabolic disease.

Introduction
The conventional approach to discover novel drugs for diabetes
mellitus is traditionally centered on agents able to lower blood
glucose with little to no attention paid to other measures of
metabolic health. However, long term clinical outcomes with the
molecules developed via this methodology have been mixed at
best. This has led to a steady though guarded rise in attention
towards novel so-called ‘‘glucose plus’’ targets that act via
multifaceted mechanisms thus offering additional metabolic
benefits beyond improvements in glycemic control [1,2]. One
example of this new class of molecules is fibroblast growth factor
21 (FGF21) [3,4], which recently emerged as a promising agent
able to simultaneously correct many if not all abnormalities in
metabolically compromised animals [5–7]. Indeed, administration
of recombinant wild type FGF21 to diabetic rodents leads to a
rapid and robust lowering of hyperglycemia, improvements in
circulating/tissue lipid levels and reduced body weight [8–11].
The attractiveness of FGF21 based preclinical pharmacology as a
superior ‘‘glucose plus’’ agent has already inspired initial efforts to
optimize and evaluate re-engineered FGF21 analogues in animal
models of metabolic disease [12–14].
We have previously demonstrated a diverse spectrum of
pharmacologic actions in diabetic monkeys following treatment
with human recombinant FGF21 [15]. Nevertheless, the advance￾ment of native FGF21 as a drug candidate is faced with significant
development challenges, most notably due to biopharmaceutical
issues of the wild type molecule [14]. Recently, we described the
structure, biopharmaceutical properties and nonclinical efficacy
profile of an FGF21 based clinical candidate, LY2405319 (LY)
[14]. In brief, to facilitate a once-daily dosing profile, in a
preserved, multi-use formulation, an additional disulfide bond was
introduced in FGF21 through Leu118Cys and Ala134Cys
mutations. FGF21 was further optimized by deletion of the four
N-terminal amino acids, His-Pro-Ile-Pro (HPIP), which are subject
to proteolytic cleavage in the native molecule. In addition, to
eliminate an O-linked glycosylation site in yeast a Ser167Ala
mutation was introduced, allowing large-scale homogenous
protein production in Pichia pastoris.
Following the initial studies in rodents [14] we went on to
evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of

LY following its administration for 7 weeks in a dose-escalating
fashion in a well-defined group of diabetic rhesus monkeys (Macaca
mulatta).
In this report we show that LY administration led to dramatic
and rapid improvements in metabolic parameters including
lowering of circulating glucose/insulin, ameliorated plasma lipid
profiles and reduced body weight. These effects were observed in
the presence of treatment-emergent LY antibodies. Importantly, in
an animal with advanced disease progression, the effects of LY on
circulating lipids and body weight were readily present even
though its glycemic efficacy was significantly attenuated. In
conclusion, our new data with LY, an engineered FGF21 variant,
support further exploration of FGF21-based therapies for the
treatment of metabolic disorders, including studies in patients at
the advanced stages of disease development.
Methods
LY Expression and Purification
LY was expressed and purified from Pichia pastoris as described
[14], and formulated in bacteriostatic NaCl (0.9%).
Animals
All animal protocols in this study were approved by the Eli Lilly
and Co. Animal Use and Care Committee. All monkeys were
single housed in stainless steel cages for the duration of the
protocol to allow for measurement of food intake as previously
described (Hansen BC, 2012, Animal Models in Diabetes
Research, Methods in Molecular Biology), water was provided
ad libitum. Monkeys were housed in a temperature controlled
facility (21uC 63uC) with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Animals were
provided with environmental enrichment and were routinely
monitored for signs of illness or distress by the veterinary care staff
throughout the duration of the study. However, at the time of
cessation of dosing none of the animals had shown any physical
signs of distress or discomfort. None of the animals were sacrificed
at any point during the study.
To establish a metabolic baseline, vehicle was administered
daily by subcutaneous injection for 6 to 15 consecutive days to a
total of 6 diabetic rhesus monkeys of either sex that had no prior
exposure to any FGF21 based molecule. Subsequently, daily
subcutaneous injections of LY were administered in a dose￾escalating fashion (3, 9, and 50 mg/kg) for a total of 7 weeks (2
weeks for the 3 and 9 mg/kg treatment period, and 3 weeks for the
50 mg/kg treatment period) followed by a 60-day follow-up period
(no injections). A 1- to 2-day washout period was included after
each of the three LY treatment periods to allow for washout of the
drug prior to drawing samples for assessment of immunogenicity.
Volumes administered ranged from 0.06 mL/kg to 1 mL/kg. Sites
of subcutaneous administration were rotated among multiple sites
on the thorax/abdomen (most commonly the lateral sides and
anterior surface) and sites were recorded for each dose.
During each period, the following parameters were monitored
as functional biomarkers of LY pharmacodynamic activity: daily
fed blood glucose and food intake, weekly body weight, bi-weekly
fasted insulin, leptin, and adiponectin, and plasma lipids at the end
of each treatment period.
Prior to the lead in period we determined that one of the 6
animals selected for the study displayed significantly more
advanced disease progression than the other members of the
cohort, as evidenced by extremely low insulin levels in the context
of overt hyperglycemia and low body weight as compared to the
rest of the animals in the treatment cohort that were hyperinsu￾linemic and obese. However, to provide insight into FGF21
biology in the context of severe diabetic pathology we included this
animal in the study and present some of the data obtained in this
monkey separate to that of the remaining members of the cohort,
both to highlight FGF21 effects in late stage disease and also to
prevent distortion of the values reported for the other animals. All
pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data in Table 1 includes all
6 animals. Data in Figures 1, 2 and 3 represent the mean of 5
animals while the results in Figure 4 represent single case
observations of the animal with advanced disease progression.
Blood Plasma Analyses
Blood glucose, fructosamine, and triglycerides (TGs) were
determined by Antech Diagnostics (New York, NY). Fasting
plasma insulin and glucagon were measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits from Linco Diagnostic
Services, Inc. (St. Charles, MO). Total cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-c) were measured using a Hitachi 912 clinical
chemistry analyzer. Cytokine analysis was done by Rules-Based
Medicine, Inc. (Austin, TX) using human antigen Multi-Analyte
Profiles (MAP) kits. All clinical chemistry, lipid composition,
cytokine, and other analyses presented in this report were
performed on the blood samples collected 24 h after the last dose
unless stated otherwise.
LY Immunoreactivity
Serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of immuno￾reactive LY protein using anti-LY antibodies by the sandwich
ELISA method. Samples were analyzed in duplicate and, when
appropriate, at multiple dilutions.
LY Immunogenicity
LY immunogenicity was assessed using a qualitative ELISA for
the detection of LY-reactive antibodies in rhesus monkey serum
samples with a detection limit of 1,150 relative ng/mL and LY
tolerance of #1.0 mg/mL.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean 6SEM. Data were analyzed using
repeated-measures analysis applied for multi-dose designs utilizing
post hoc analysis (Tukey). Differences were considered significant
when p = ,0.05.
Results
Pharmacokinetics of LY in Diabetic Rhesus Monkeys
Exposures to LY following its chronic subcutaneous adminis￾tration to diabetic rhesus monkeys were evaluated by sandwich
ELISA. LY levels were measured in fasting plasma samples
collected weekly during the lead in and treatment phase. The
mean plasma concentration of LY from each dosing phase
increased in a dose dependent manner from 3 to 50 mg/kg
(Table 1). There was no significant buildup of LY in plasma, as
evidenced by the proportional increase in exposure at each dose
escalation (Table 1).
LY Immunogenicity
All 6 animals demonstrated positive anti-LY2405319 antibody
titers during the study. LY-reactive antibodies were measured in
serum samples collected during the vehicle lead-in and 1–2 days
following the final dose for each treatment period. Additional
samples were collected during week 2 and 3 of the follow-up
period, and during weeks 4, 6, and 8 of the follow-up period.

Treatment-emergent anti-LY immunoglobulins were detected in
all 6 monkeys with titers ranging from 10 to .31,250 (Table 1).
The reported titers may be underestimated due to the presence of
residual serum concentrations of LY (.1.0 mg/mL).
Body Weight Loss and Food Intake Reduction
Similar to the effects observed with administration of wild type
FGF21 in rodents [7–9] and in primates [12,15], all monkeys
experienced progressive weight loss during each dosing phase
amounting to 12.5%–23.6% reduction from baseline body weight
over the 7 weeks of treatment (Figure 1A). During the washout
phase, all animals began to gain weight, although in spite of
rebound weight gain animals still weighed less at the end of the
washout period than prior to LY dosing (Figure 1A).
Food consumption was assessed daily and converted to weekly
caloric intake. Following two weeks of LY treatment food intake
was dramatically suppressed when compared to basal values
similar to the results of the previous studies with FGF21 in this
species [12,15]. This reduction in caloric intake persisted until the
final week of compound administration and was dose dependent in
nature (Figure 1B). During the washout phase, the food intake
initially returned to the baseline level then transiently increased
over pretreatment intake suggesting a compensatory/rebound
response following the cessation of the LY treatment (Figure 1B).
The reduction in calorie consumption during the LY administra￾tion phase likely contributed to the observed body weight lowering
effect.
Glycemic Effects of Chronic LY Administration
Prior to LY administration, mean baseline plasma glucose was
above 200 mg/dL (Figure 2A), approximately three fold higher
than normal and significantly elevated relative to the diagnostic
criteria established for type 2 diabetes in this species [16]. LY
treatment decreased mean non-fasted blood glucose concentra￾tions in a rapid manner, from an overtly diabetic level to a
complete normalization that was highly sustainable throughout the
entire dosing phase (Figure 2A). Importantly, no incidents of
hypoglycemia were noted in any animal at any dose of LY even
though large reductions in circulating glucose concentrations were
observed during the treatment period. Upon cessation of
compound administration, blood glucose increased over time,
reaching at the end of the washout period concentrations similar to
those in the lead-in phase (Figure 2A).
LY Lowers Systemic Lipids in an FGF21 Like Manner
Mean fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations were signifi￾cantly reduced during LY administration, with near-maximal
efficacy already observed after only 1 week of treatment at the
lowest dose, and only slight additional reductions with higher doses
during the remainder of the treatment period (Figure 2B). Thus,
after 7 weeks of LY therapy, circulating triglycerides were lowered
by 87% relative to baseline values. LY also had a significant and
positive impact on the circulating cholesterol profile in the
monkeys with its total content decreased by 39% at the end of
dosing (Figure 2C). When broken down by fraction there was a
significant reduction in VLDL levels which were decreased by
approximately 87% at the final dosing time point (Figure 2D).
LDL levels were also lower at the final time point of the treatment
period (Figure 2E). Importantly, the HDL fraction was signifi￾cantly elevated throughout by all doses of LY with a 77% increase
at the end of the LY administration (Figure 2F).
LY Regulates Circulating Hormones and Adipokines
Recently our group and others have reported FGF21-induced
regulation of the circulating levels and improved total body
sensitivity to a multitude of other metabolic factors such as insulin,
leptin and adiponectin highlighting one of the major mechanisms
of FGF21 in vivo action [7,9,15,17]. In this study with the use of
LY in diabetic monkeys we are able to replicate these earlier
findings. Concomitant with the reductions in plasma glucose,
circulating insulin levels were robustly reduced, with complete
normalization observed in the final week of treatment (Figure 3A).
Adiponectin was significantly elevated already after 1 week of LY
therapy and continued to increase throughout the treatment
period. Following cessation of dosing, adiponectin levels dropped
rapidly returning to basal values after only 2 weeks of a follow-up
phase. Plasma leptin levels trended to be reduced during both the
3 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg dosing periods and were significantly lower
for the final 3 weeks of LY administration at the 50 mg/kg dose,
then trended up but still remained lower for the duration of the
follow-up period.

LY is Partially Efficacious in An Animal with Advanced
Diabetes Disease Progression
To date, it has not been determined whether FGF21 based
therapy, often deemed to correct hyperglycemia via an insulin
sensitization mechanism [6], remains efficacious with regard to
glucose endpoints in the context of low insulin levels. Therefore, in
addition to the overtly hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic
animals in the primary study group we also evaluated the
pharmacologic response to LY in one other animal (hereby
referred to as J-15). J-15 presented with extremely low pre￾treatment insulin levels (14 mU/mL), significant hyperglycemia
(275 mg/dL, fed glucose) and low body weight (,10 kg at study
intake) representative of a more advanced stage of diabetes disease
as compared to 5 other monkeys in the main cohort. Treatment of
J-15 with low and intermediate doses of LY did not lead to serum
glucose reduction, and only at the highest 50 mg/kg dose glucose
lowering was observed. This effect was however fairly attenuated
and did not reach normalization or glycaemia (Figure 4A) as
compared to the LY efficacy toward glucose lowering in the
primary study group (Figure 2A). Importantly, there was also only
a slight modulation of insulin levels in J-15 throughout the entire
dosing period (Figure 4B).
Interestingly, and in spite of the fact that J-15 had lower body
weight at the beginning of the study, LY still remained potently
efficacious to induce body weight loss (Figure 4C). This body

cholesterol (E) and HDL cholesterol (F) throughout the duration of the study. Differences considered significant (p,0.05) are denoted by *.

weight lowering is thought to be in part due to a dramatic
reduction in food intake during the entirety of the drug
administration period, similar to that seen in the cohort as a
whole (Figure 4D). In contrast to the attenuated ability to impact
glycaemia and insulin, there was no loss of LY efficacy in J-15
toward lipid endpoints; the effects were observed with triglycerides
(Figure 4E), total cholesterol (Figure 4F), VLDL (Figure 4G), LDL
(Figure 4H) and HDL (Figure 4I). With regard to their magnitude,
the changes in lipid profiles in J-15 resembled those observed in
the other monkeys. Furthermore, plasma adiponectin levels in J-15
were elevated by all LY doses and returned to baseline rapidly at
the cessation of treatment (Figure 4J). Finally, circulating leptin
during the lead in phase was low in this animal likely due to J-159s
low adiposity; however, in line with the other animals, it was
further reduced by LY treatment (Figure 4K).
Discussion
Non-human primates are thought to develop type 2 diabetes in
a very similar manner to that observed in humans and thus offer
an ideal test system for testing of anti-diabetic therapeutics [16].
Indeed, our group and others have reported significant potency of
both native FGF21 [12,15] and FGF21 variants [12] in this model.
Previously, we have demonstrated that our LY retains equivalent
in vivo efficacy in rodent models of obesity and diabetes with no
significant differences in the mechanism of action when compared
to wild type FGF21 [14]. Thus, given the generally exceptional
translational quality of the experimental data obtained in rhesus
monkeys that developed diabetes in a natural way [16], we chose
to evaluate our FGF21-based candidate, LY, in this model.
Importantly, we show here that LY displays therapeutic
characteristics similar to wild type FGF21 in the rhesus monkey.
As with FGF21 administration, LY was able to rapidly and
robustly improve and maintain tight glycemic control within the
normal range over the course of the treatment while also
delivering dramatic reductions in both circulating lipids and body
weight. Together, these findings confirm that our engineered
variant of the native FGF21 protein, LY, demonstrates therapeutic
characteristics similar to FGF21 in non-human primates. The
maximal efficacy of LY and wild type FGF21 are indeed similar
which is likely due to the fact that neither FGF21 nor LY are able
to lower glucose beyond the normal range in these species
(Figure 2A, [15]). Nevertheless, if one compares the time taken to
reach significantly meaningful glucose lowering, LY achieves
glucose normalization in approximately 1 week of treatment
(Figure 2) while in our previous study with the native FGF21
protein this effect took approximately 4 weeks to attain signifi￾cance [15]. Given that higher LY doses were utilized in this study
compared to our previous experiment [14], this differential in the
onset of correction of hyperglycemia raises the possibility that
greater doses of FGF21 and/or use of FGF21 variants with
improved potency may offer a more rapid and sustainable
therapeutic response. It is noteworthy that despite the develop￾Figure 3. Prominent hormones such as insulin (A), leptin (B) and adiponectin (C) were found to be regulated by LY2405319.

ment of antibodies to LY, the pharmacologic effects were sustained
through the end of the 7-week treatment period suggesting that LY
antibodies were not neutralizing in nature.
Recently we and others have reported that the metabolic effect
of FGF21 is heavily reliant on engagement of the FGFR1/KLB
complex in white adipose tissue [10,18]. Activation of this receptor
complex in fat leads to profound changes in circulating adipokines
indicative of increased sensitivity to these factors in their target
tissues [10,19,20]. Here we demonstrate that treatment with LY
also leads to a rapid and robust induction of adiponectin, a known
insulin sensitizer [21]. Importantly, we show in the present study
that this increase in plasma adiponectin is not driven by
modulation of either adiposity or food intake as the massive
induction of adiponectin returns to normal prior to significant
changes in weight or caloric intake. Thus, LY, as well as native
FGF21, is a potent in vivo adiponectin secretagogue. Given that
FGF21 is unable to lower glucose in adiponectin null mice [22,23]
one can surmise that the increase in adiponectin is explicitly
required for FGF21s glycemic effect. When coupled with the
insulin lowering phenotype observed in the monkeys and the fact
that the induction of adiponectin is also present in higher
mammals these data serve as an additional indicator of potential
primate-to-human translatability of the glucose lowering effect
observed with LY.
While caution must be exercised due to the single case nature of
the data, the fact that LY remained partially efficacious in an
animal at the late stage of disease development opens the
possibility that FGF21 based therapy may have therapeutic utility
in patients with well advanced type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, and
even though the glycemic efficacy of LY did appear to be partially
blunted, adiponectin levels in J-15 were increased robustly and to a
similar degree as in the other 5 obese monkeys (Figure 3B vs.
Figure 4I]. Thus, adiponectin appears to be necessary but not
entirely sufficient to trigger robust FGF21-driven glucose lowering
in an animal at an advanced stage of disease progression. Further
mechanistic insight into this dichotomy likely centers around the
lack of meaningful insulin production in J-15 (Figure 4B), as
without appropriate plasma levels of insulin the glycemic effect of
adiponectin, a sensitizer to insulin action, is unlikely to occur.
Nevertheless, beyond impaired glucose lowering, the ability of LY
to lower plasma lipids and body weight was fully retained in J-15
as evidenced by similar changes in these parameters when
compared to those observed in the larger cohort (Figure 1 & 2
vs. Figure 4). This further supports the idea of FGF21 being a truly
pleiotropic factor in vivo, able to induce a multitude of the
metabolic effects in a parallel manner via an array of diverse
adipose centric mechanisms [17].
Conclusions
Our data show that the FGF21 based clinical candidate, LY, is
robustly efficacious in diabetic rhesus monkeys where it is able to
induce the full gamut of FGF21 biology. Chronic administration of
the compound led to dramatic improvements in both serum
glucose and lipids in addition to robust effects on food intake and
body weight. Furthermore, in an animal with late stage diabetes,
FGF21 therapy retained the majority of its efficacy with
attenuation of only glycemic aspects of FGF21-mediated pharma￾cology. In conclusion, this work provides further evidence to
support the investigation of FGF21 as a potential multifaceted
‘‘glucose plus’’ agent and supports further discovery and develop￾ment of FGF21 based therapies.
