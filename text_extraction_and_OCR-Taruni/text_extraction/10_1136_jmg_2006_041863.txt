Abstract
Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a


genetically heterogeneous disorder characterised by constitutive
defects in cellular cytotoxicity resulting in fever,
hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia, and the outcome is fatal unless
treated by chemoimmunotherapy followed by haematopoietic stem-
cell transplantation. Since 1999, mutations in the perforin gene
giving rise to this disease have been identified; however, these
account only for 40% of cases. Lack of a genetic marker hampers
the diagnosis, suitability for transplantation, selection of familial
donors, identification of carriers, genetic counselling and prenatal
diagnosis. Mutations in the Munc13–4 gene have recently been
described in patients with FHL. We sequenced the Munc13–4 gene
in all patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis not due to
PRF1 mutations.
In 15 of the 30 families studied, 12 novel and 4 known Munc13–4
mutations were found, spread throughout the gene. Among novel
mutations, 2650C→T introduced a stop codon; 441del A, 532del C,
3082del C and 3226ins G caused a frameshift, and seven were mis
sense mutations. Median age of diagnosis was 4 months, but six
patients developed the disease after 5 years of age and one as a
young adult of 18 years. Involvement of central nervous system was
present in 9 of 15 patients, activity of natural killer cells was
markedly reduced or absent in 13 of 13 tested patients. Chemo-
immunotherapy was effective in all patients.
Munc13–4 mutations were found in 15 of 30 patients with FHL
without PRF1 mutations. Because these patients may develop the
disease during adolescence or even later, haematologists should
include FHL2 and FHL3 in the differential diagnosis of young adults
with fever, cytopenia, splenomegaly and hypercytokinaemia.
