Reconstruction of the Anterior Abdominal
Wall
Classification of Defect
Defects of the abdominal wall can be characterized as partial
thickness or full thickness based upon the anatomic compo￾nents of the defect. A partial-thickness defect describes awound
where either the skin or the subcutaneous tissue is resected.
Full-thickness defects encompass a loss of both superficial soft
tissue and the deeper musculofascial layers. This distinction is
important when considering reconstructive options. It follows
that partial-thickness defects are more amendable to primary
closure, negative-pressure assisted closure, and skin grafting.
Full-thickness defects often require musculofascial reinforce￾ment and therefore need composite flap coverage with or
without mesh to prevent herniation and bulge formation.
Surgical Reconstructive Options
Primary Closure
Primary closure is the preferred method of closing smaller,
partial-thickness defects of the anterior abdominal wall. The
presence of significant excess abdominal tissue, such as that
seen in obese patients, can facilitate primary closure by
providing available vascularized tissue for coverage. Accord￾ingly, one should attempt primary closure of these partial
thickness defects of the anterior abdominal wall when the
size of the defect is less than 5 cm.1 Raising fasciocutaneous
flaps off the abdominal wall fascia can help facilitate this
closure. However, care should be taken to provide adequate
laxity in an effort to prevent ischemia, potential dehiscence,
or abdominal compartment syndrome.2
Skin Grafting
Skin grafting can provide cutaneous coverage of abdominal
wall defects that are not amendable to primary closure. Given
that skin grafts provide little musculofascial support, they are
generally not used when there is loss of abdominal wall
musculature; therefore, they are relatively contraindicated
in larger, complete defects. At times, they can be used to cover
exposed bowel in situations where it is clinically inappropri￾ate to close the abdominal wall. Advantages of skin grafting
include relative abundance of donor tissue and the ability to

Abstract Reconstruction of complex defects of the anterior abdomen is both challenging and
technically demanding for reconstructive surgeons. Advancements in the use of pedicle
and free tissue transfer along with the use of bioprosthetic and synthetic meshes have
provided for novel approaches to these complex defects. Accordingly, detailed knowl￾edge of abdominal wall and lower extremity anatomy in combination with insight into
the design, implementation, and limitations of various flaps is essential to solve these
complex clinical problems. Although these defects can be attributed to a myriad of
etiologic factors, the objectives in abdominal wall reconstruction are consistent and
include the restoration of abdominal wall integrity, protection of intraabdominal
viscera, and the prevention of herniation. In this article, the authors review pertinent
anatomy and the various local, regional, and distant flaps that can be utilized in the
reconstruction of these complex clinical cases of the anterior abdomen.

graft on top of viscera. Disadvantages include the aforemen￾tioned relative lack of structural support, donor site morbidi￾ty, and poor aesthetic outcomes.
Tissue Expansion
Tissue expansion can provide superficial as well as full￾thickness coverage for abdominal wall defects depending
upon the needs for reconstruction and the suitability of the
surrounding tissues. Although tissue expansion is a delayed
procedure that requires serial expansions, it can provide well￾perfused, autologous tissue with excellent aesthetic out￾comes. Given that infection of the implant invariably leads
to explantation of the prosthesis, care must be taken to ensure
sterility and a surgically sound operation.
Negative Pressure-Assisted Closure
Negative pressure-assisted closure can provide for temporary
coverage in anterior abdominal wall defects when definitive
reconstruction is delayed. When utilized correctly this device
can promote vascularization, decrease edema, and increase
local granulation tissue.3 Although this modality can be used
to prepare the wound bed for definitive reconstruction with
flaps, it can also be used to promote healing by secondary
intention in partial-thickness defects.
Locoregional Flaps
Component separation with or without the use of mesh has
revolutionized the treatment of complex anterior abdominal
wall defects.4 Although these operations address many of the
challenges encountered with providing underlying tissue
strength, the reconstruction of the more superficial fascial
layers of the abdominal wall remains a challenge. To address
the soft tissue coverage of these defects, most reconstructive
surgeons advocate using flaps from the local or regional
vicinity. As such, the reconstruction is typically performed
in a pedicled fashion with the choice of flap depending on the
location and size of the defect. Commonly utilized locore￾gional flap options include, but are not limited to, the external
oblique muscle, tensor fascia lata, rectus abdominis muscle,
rectus femoris muscle, anterolateral thigh with or without a
portion of vastus lateralis muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle,
and omental flaps. Combining soft tissue reconstruction with
bioprosthetic or synthetic mesh allows the reconstructive
surgeon the ability to recapitulate abdominal wall form and
function.
The external oblique muscle provides a local option in the
correction of abdominal wall defects and can be used any￾where in the abdominal wall. Given the limited arc of rotation,
some authors recommend that the flap's usage is limited to
the upper two thirds of the abdominal wall.5 Additionally, its
usage can be limited due to concerns pertaining to the
amount and viability of the underlying skin that can safely
be transferred with this flap.
The tensor fascia lata flap is generally regarded as one of
the more useful regional flaps used in reconstruction of
anterior abdominal wall defects that are located in the lower
two thirds of the abdomen.6 The thickness of the overlying
fascia lata provides the much needed strength required for
reconstruction in this area and often precludes the need for
underlying mesh placement. This flap can be harvested with
or without an overlying skin paddle. However, this flap
should be used with caution in the reconstruction of defects
of the upper one third of the abdomen due to the relative
unreliability of the distal one third of the skin paddle.
The rectus abdominis muscle flap provides a local option for
defects anywhere in the anterior abdominal wall. The pedicles
on this flap can be manipulated to provide cranial coverage
based upon the superior epigastric artery or caudal coverage
based upon the deep inferior epigastric artery. Care must be
taken when closing the donor site to prevent future bulge and
hernia formation. As such, some authors advocate closing the
defects with mesh to prevent these complications.7
The rectus femoris muscle flap provides another option in
reconstruction of anterior defects of the lower two thirds of
the abdominal wall. This flap contains a large arc of rotation,
albeit not as great as that of the tensor fascia lata flap.
However, due to the important function of the rectus femoris
muscle in ambulation, this flap can be associated with donor
site morbidity due to weakening of the quadriceps function.8
The vastus lateralis muscle flap is another viable option in
the reconstruction of anterior portions of the lower one third
of the abdominal wall. The vastus lateralis muscle can be
harvested with a skin island in the form of an anterolateral
thigh (ALT) myocutaneous flap. The utility of this flap is that it
can be harvested with variable amounts of skin, fascia, and
muscle. The abdominal wall defect will dictate the soft tissue
requirements from the thigh. This flap can be harvested as
either a pedicle or free flap. When using the pedicle option, it
is important to tunnel the flap below the rectus femoris
muscle proximally and to create a large subcutaneous tunnel
into the abdomen so as not to compress the flap or pedicle.
This flap can easily reach defects of the anterior abdomen and
higher based on length of the donor thigh and the amount of
skin taken with the flap. When large skin paddles are taken
with the ALT, the donor site is closed with a skin graft. Donor
site morbidity is low as most patients ambulate without any
difficulty postoperatively.9
The latissimus dorsi muscle flap is an option for regional
flap reconstruction of anterior defects of the upper one third
of the abdominal wall. The major potential limitation of this
flap is the ability to reach the upper abdomen in patients with
a longer torso. Another potential limitation of this flap is the
donor site morbidity of harvesting a large skin paddle and the
potential need for skin graft coverage of the back. Additional￾ly, the latissimus dorsi harvest can limit upper extremity
motion in some patients; however, compensation by the
rotator cuff muscles is typically seen.10
The omentum, though not the first choice in regional flap
coverage, can prove excellent protection of the underlying
viscera in situations where options are limited. It derives a
reliable blood supply from the right and left gastroepiploic
arteries. This flap can provide protection of the entire ab￾dominal wall and perineal areas and has the advantage of
being highly vascular while providing substantial soft tissue
volume for transfer. Unfortunately, the omentum requires
skin for grafting and repair of the resultant hernia with mesh.

Thus, omental flaps can be considered an option in abdominal
wall reconstruction when all other regional sources are
exhausted or free tissue transfer is not available.
Free Tissue Transfer
Free tissue transfer for abdominal wall defects is considered
by some to be a last resort in abdominal wall reconstruction.
However, free tissue transfer can present distinct advantages
over regional flaps because they provide a larger volume of
tissue, augment local blood supply to promote rapid healing,
and do not incur donor morbidity in the adjacent abdominal
wall. They should be considered when potential regional flaps
are not available, are not within reach of the defect, or are of
insufficient size to safely cover the defect. Potential difficul￾ties in free tissue transfer to this region are the lack of a
suitable recipient vessel, as the etiology of the defect may
have rendered surrounding tissue nonviable. Recipient ves￾sels within this region include the inferior and superior
epigastric arteries, the deep circumflex iliac artery, and
internal thoracic artery. Vein grafts can be used to augment
the reach of free tissue transfers when recipient vessels are
not close or pedicle length is short. Specifically, arteriovenous
flaps can be brought off of the femoral vessels using a
saphenous vein graft.11
Commonly utilized free flaps for reconstruction of this
region include the ALT and the tensor fasciae lata flaps. These
flaps are based upon the lateral circumflex femoral system.
The abdominal wall defect will dictate the appropriate flap
based on the need for fasciocutaneous and musculocutaneous
elements. The ALT myocutaneous flap provides an increased
amount of muscle and fascia and can be utilized in larger
abdominal wall defects. This tissue also contains some of the
resilient deep fascia of the lateral thigh and can provide for
strong coverage of abdominal wall defects. This flap can be
combined with bioprosthetic mesh to reconstruct large sec￾tions of the anterior abdominal wall (►Fig. 1).12

The free tensor fascia lata flap of the lateral thigh provides
an ideal flap for smaller abdominal wall defects. The deep
fascia of the lateral thigh includes the iliotibial tract and fascia
lata and provides strong and tough tissue, which can aid in
wall strength and potentially prevent postoperative abdomi￾nal wall laxity. Although there can be many different flaps
utilized in free tissue transfer, it is recommended that the
fascia of the resultant flap be sutured into the native abdomi￾nal wall in an underlay or inlay fashion to prevent herniation.
This repair should have some tension, but effort should be
taken as to not make the fascia exceptionally tight to prevent
ischemia of local tissues.
Postoperative Care
Postoperative care of the patient undergoing abdominal wall
reconstruction is similar to that of any patient with major
abdominal surgery. These patients will typically have their
bowel manipulated, which can lead to an ileus. Standard
advancement of diet with the resumption of bowel activity
must be performed. The patient can be placed in an abdomi￾nal binder postoperatively in an effort to reduce strain on the
fascial repair. In addition, antiemetic therapy should be given
aggressively to these patients postoperatively in an effort to
prevent vomiting, which can increase intraabdominal pres￾sures that can further complicate repair. These patients
should have judicious pulmonary toilet and monitoring of
pulmonary function as abdominal distention can compro￾mise respiratory function. Finally, patients should be in￾structed to avoid strenuous activity for upwards of 3 to
6 months to optimize healing and prevent bulge or hernia
formation. When reconstructing the abdominal wall using
either pedicle or free flaps, it is critical to place liberal
amounts of closed self-suction drains. Placement of drains
will help limit the potential for dead-space secondary to
hematoma and seroma formation. Fluid collections in the
abdominal wall have the potential to lead to poor wound
healing and infectious complications.
Conclusions
Reconstruction of complex anterior abdominal wall defects
presents a unique reconstructive challenge to physicians.
With the myriad of techniques available today, it is possible
to reconstruct the entire abdomen safely. The use of autolo￾gous tissue in the form of pedicle and free flaps provides for
optimal results in the majority of these cases and can be safely
performed with knowledge of the benefits and potential
limitations of their usage. Bioprosthetic and synthetic meshes
offer the reconstructive surgeon additional options to com￾bine with soft tissue reconstructive techniques. Careful as￾sessment of the defect combined with sound preoperative
planning and meticulous surgical execution allows the re￾constructive surgeon the ability to close complex anterior
abdominal wall defects with confidence.
