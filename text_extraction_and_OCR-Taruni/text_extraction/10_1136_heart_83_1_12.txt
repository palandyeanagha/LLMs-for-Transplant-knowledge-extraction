Abstract
OBJECTIVE To examine whether social deprivation has any
independent effect on emergency cardiac hospitalisations in
patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
DESIGN Cohort study of 478 patients with CHF who had been
hospitalised before 1993 and who were followed up during 1993
and 1994.
SETTING Emergency admissions within Tayside acute hospitals.
PATIENTS 478 CHF patients who had a previous myocardial
infarction, a previous CHF admission, and were on diuretic
treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Emergency hospital admissions are
divided into those for all causes and those for cardiac causes only.
RESULTS Social deprivation was significantly associated with an
increase in the number of cardiac hospitalisations (p = 0.007). This
effect was mainly caused by increasing the proportion of patients
hospitalised in each deprivation category (26% in deprivation
category 1–2 versus 40% in deprivation category 5–6, p = 0.03).
This effect of deprivation was independent of disease severity, as
judged by the dose of prescribed diuretic, the death rate, and the
duration of each hospital stay. Non-adherence with diuretic
treatment could not account for these findings either.
CONCLUSIONS Social deprivation increases the chance of a CHF
patient being rehospitalised independently of disease severity.
Possible explanations are that doctors who look after socially
deprived patients have a lower threshold for cardiac hospitalisation
of their patients, or that social deprivation alters the way a CHF
patient accesses medical care during decompensation.
Understanding how social deprivation influences both doctor and
patient behaviour in the prehospital phase is now crucial in order to
reduce the amplifying effect that social deprivation appears to have
on cardiac hospitalisations.
