Abstract
Background: Liver biopsy is considered as the gold standard for assessing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
histologic lesions in patients with severe obesity. The aim of this study was to perform an overview of 3 studies which
assessed the performance of non-invasive markers of fibrosis (FibroTest), steatosis (SteatoTest) and steato-hepatitis
(NashTest, ActiTest) in these patients.
Methods: 494 patients with interpretable biopsy and biomarkers using of three prospective cohorts of patients with severe
obesity (BMI .35 kg/m2) were included. Histology (NAS score) and the biochemical measurements were blinded to any
other characteristics. The area under the ROC curves (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
were assessed. Weighted AUROC (wAUROC Obuchowski method) was used to prevent multiple testing and spectrum effect.
Two meta-analyses were performed; one used the individual patient, and the other a classical meta-analysis.
Results: Prevalence of advanced fibrosis (bridging) was 9.9%, advanced steatosis (.33%) 54.2%, and steato-hepatitis (NAS
score .4) 17.2%. The mean wAUROCs were: FibroTest for advanced fibrosis (95%CI; significance) = 0.85 (0.83–0.87;
P,0.0001); SteatoTest for advanced steatosis = 0.80 (0.79–0.83); and ActiTest for steato-hepatitis = 0.84 (0.82–0.86;
P,0.0001). Using the classical meta-analysis (random effect model) the mean AUROCs were: FibroTest = 0.72 (0.63–0.79;
P,0.0001); SteatoTest = 0.71 (0.66–0.75; P,0.0001); and ActiTest = 0.74 (0.68–0.79; P,0.0001). Despite more metabolic risk
factors in one cohort, results were similar according to gender, presence of diabetes and between the 3 cohorts.
Conclusion: In patients with severe obesity, a significant diagnostic performance of FibroTest, SteatoTest and ActiTest was
observed for liver lesions.

Introduction
Severe obesity is associated with decreased life expectancy [1].
In terms of liver injury, severe obesity is implicated in development
of non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including steatosis,
non alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis [2–4].
Non invasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis have been extensively
validated in chronic viral hepatitis and more recently in patients
with alcoholic and non alcoholic fatty liver diseases, the most
validated serum fibrosis biomarkers being FibroTestH/FibroSureH
(FT) [5–8]. In patients at high risk of NAFLD, FT has been
validated in two studies [9,10].
Very few biomarkers have been validated for the diagnosis of
steatosis or NASH, including patients with severe obesity [7,8,10].
The aim of the present study was to better assess the
performance of 4 previously published biomarkers, of fibrosis
(FT) [9], of steatosis (SteatoTestH)(ST) [11] and of necrosis and
inflammation [ActiTestH (AT) and NashTestH (NT)] [12], the
combination of these 4 biomarkers is named FibroMaxH, in
patients with severe obesity. As part of the FLIP consortium
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e30325

European project [13], a large integrated database of 494 patients
was constructed using 3 recent validation studies performed
independently from the inventor’s group permitting to increase of
number of patients with advanced liver injuries.
The specific goal was to estimate the diagnostic performance of
these biomarkers versus ALT the routine liver test, using the most
accurate methods already applied in patients with chronic hepatitis
C: meta-analysis of individual data [14], and standardized area
under the characteristics receiver operating curves (AUROCs)
[15–17].
Methods
Informed consent have been obtained for all patients and all
clinical investigation have been conducted according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethic
committee of Groupe Hospitalier Pitie´ Salpeˆtrie`re has approved
the research.
We identify all clinical studies assessing the diagnostic
performance of FT, ST, AT and NT, in obese patients. Two
meta-analyses were performed. One used the integrated database
of these studies combining individual data provided by authors,
and the other was a classical meta-analysis of these studies but
using weighted AUROCs. Finally the performances of the four
biomarkers and ALT were assessed using methods without gold
standard.
Patients
To be eligible for the study, all patients had to have fulfilled the
following criteria: (1) severe obesity (BMI.35 kg/m2), (2) absence
of current excessive drinking, as defined by average daily
consumption of alcohol of 20 g/day for women and 30 g/day
for men; (3) absence of long-term consumption of hepatotoxic
drugs; and (4) negative screening for chronic liver diseases,
including negative testing for hepatitis B surface antigen and
hepatitis C virus antibodies, and no evidence of genetic
hemochromatosis.
The following clinical and biological features were required
for the integrated data base: weight, height, BMI, blood
pressure, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl
transferase (GGT), serum triglyceride, cholesterolemia, fasting
blood glucose and interpretable biomarkers FT, ST, AT and
NT. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia
were defined as follows: fasting blood glucose.1.26 g/l, chole￾sterolemia.2.4 g/l and serum triglyceride.1.5 g/l, or respec￾tive specific treatment.
Biomarkers measurements
FT, ST, AT and NT (Biopredictive, Paris, France; Fibro￾SUREH is the brand name for FT in USA, LabCorp, Burlington,
NC, USA) were determined as has been previously published
[6,14]. The published recommended pre-analytical and analytical
procedures were used [6,14]. FT includes a2-macroglobulin,
apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, total bilirubin, and GGT,
adjusted for age and gender; AT includes same 5 components
plus transaminases ALT; ST and NT included the same 6
components than AT plus serum glucose, triglycerides and
cholesterol, adjusted for age, gender and BMI.
FT, AT and ST scores range from zero to 1.00, with higher
scores indicating a greater probability of significant lesions. The
predetermined FT conversion for the METAVIR fibrosis stage
scoring system is 0.00–0.27 for F0; .0.27–0.48 for F1; .0.48–
0.58 for F2; .0.58–0.74 for F3; .0.74 for F4 [14]. The
predetermined AT conversion for the METAVIR activity grade
scoring system is 0.00–0.17 for A0; .0.17–0.52 for A1; .0.52–
0.62 for A2; .0.62 for A3 [17]. The predetermined ST conversion
for steatosis grade is 0.00–0.57 for S0; .0.57–0.69 for S1; and
.0.69–1.000 for S2–S3 [11]. The NT is a 3 categories score for
predicting 3 NAS categories: 0.25 is ‘‘No-Nash’’, 0.50 ‘‘Possible
Nash’’ and 0.75 ‘‘Nash’’ [12].
Patents reference were for FT-AT: USPTO #6631330, ST
#20090111132 and NT: #20080145864. Standard manufacturer
algorithms were used to exclude high risk profile of false negative/
positive [6,14,18–19].
Histological analysis
In the three studies, histological features were scored according
to the same criteria than those used in the FT/AT [9,17], ST [11],
and NT [12] validations in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), and those used in the NAFLD scoring system (NAS)
[20]. Fibrosis was scored using a predetermined scoring system
equivalent to METAVIR scoring system [20–22] and used in the
first FT validation in NAFLD [9]. Fibrosis was staged on a scale of
0 to 4: F0 – no fibrosis; F1 – portal fibrosis or perivenular fibrosis
without septa; F2 – few septa; F3 – numerous septa without
cirrhosis; and F4 – cirrhosis.
Steatosis was quantified by low- to medium-power evaluation
of parenchymal involvement by steatosis (percentage of steatosis).
Steatosis was scored using the NAS scoring system from 0 to 3
with a four grades scoring system from S0 to S3: S0–no steatosis
or ,5%; S1–5% to 33%; S2- .33% to 66% and S3 .66%
[11,20].
NASH was classified using the NAS score [20], defined as the
sum of scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3) and
ballooning (0–2), thus ranging from 0 to 8. Cases with NAS of 0 to
2 were considered not diagnostic of NASH; cases with scores of 5
or greater were diagnosed as NASH. Cases with activity scores of 3
and 4 were considered as borderline, possible NASH [20]. In each
population, liver biopsies were classified by a centralized
pathologists blinded to the clinical and biological data. Liver
biopsies were performed during the operative procedure, by
Hepafix needle in half of cases. Patients with more than 6 months
between biopsy and serum samples were not included. Biopsies
were routinely stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s
trichrome.
Statistical analysis
Methods were detailed in File S1 and Figure S1. In order to
take into account the spectrum effect and to prevent multiple
testing risk, the primary endpoint for each quantitative biomark￾er’s performance (FT, AT, ST) was the Obuchowski measure [14–
16]. This measure is a multinomial version of the AUROC. With
N categories of the gold standard outcome (i.e. histological fibrosis
stage) and AUROCst, the estimate of the AUROC of diagnostic
tests for differentiating between categories s and t, the Obuchowski
measure, is a weighted average of the N(N21)/2 different
AUROCst corresponding to all the pairwise comparisons between
2 of the N categories. Each pairwise comparison between stages
has been weighted (wAUROC) to take into account the distance
between grades or stages. AMSTAR recommendations were
followed for the meta-analysis [23]. The secondary outcomes were
the AUROC using the standard definition of liver injury and
predictive values using predetermined cutoffs as defined in the
validation of biomarkers in NAFLD [6,9,10,11,12,14,17,20]. A
sensitivity analysis of biomarkers analysis was performed in
patients with diabetes versus patients without diabetes, according
to gender and according to age (50 years cutoff).

Results
Studies search
A total of 212 studies of biomarkers have been identified in
patients with obesity or NAFLD, including 90 studies of steatosis’
biomarkers, 54 studies of fibrosis’ biomarkers, and 51 of steato￾hepatitis’ biomarkers.
Among these 212 studies, three were included as specifically
conducted in patients with severe obesity (Figure 1 and Figure
S2): three [10,24,25] assessed FT, ST, AT and NT. One study is
part of an ongoing cohort (Lille cohort) [10,26]; for the other two
(Paris and Bethune cohorts) [24,25] the performances of
biomarkers were not detailed in the publications but the authors
shared the individual data; five other studies investigated these
tests in patients with NAFLD but not specifically in severe obese
patients and were not included: FT [9,13], ST [11,13], NT
[12,13].
Patients included (Figure 1)
In the Lille cohort, 288 patients were included [10,26], 114 in
the Paris cohort, and 84 in the Bethune cohort. Between the
cohorts there was few significant differences, mostly less metabolic
factors in the Bethune cohort (Table 1). There was no significant
difference between included and non included patients’ charac￾teristics.
Integrated analysis
The AUROCs were detailed in Figure S2.
Performance of FibroTest for the diagnosis of
fibrosis. Prevalence of advanced fibrosis (METAVIR stage
F2-F3-F4) was 9.9% (Table 1).
The FT mean wAUROC was (95%CI; significance vs random)
0.85 (0.83–0.87; P,0.0001) and for ALT 0.84 (0.82–0.86;
P,0.0001 not different vs FT; Z = 0.3; P = 0.77). Pairwise
comparisons between stages are given in table 2. FT wAUROC
was also highly significant in 141 patients with diabetes 0.80 (0.78–
0.82; P,0.0001).
Classical AUROC of FT was 0.72 (0.63–0.79; P,0.0001). The
FT values according to each stage are given in Figure 2A.
Performance of SteatoTest for the diagnosis of
steatosis. Prevalence of advanced steatosis (.33%) was
54.2% (Table 1). Severe steatosis (.66%) represented 20.2%
(100/494) of patients versus 34% (168/494) for marked steatosis
(33–66%). The ST mean weighted AUROC was 0.80 (0.79–0.83)
significantly greater (Z = 5.2 P,0.0001) than that of ALT 0.75
(0.73–0.77; P,0.0001). Pairwise comparisons between steatosis
grades (S0/S1/S2S3) are given in Table 2. ST weighted accuracy
was also highly significant in 141 patients with diabetes 0.76 (0.72–
0.80; P,0.0001). Classical AUROC of ST was 0.71 (0.66–0.75;
P,0.0001). The ST values according to each steatosis grade are
given in Figure 2B.
Performance of NashTest, and ActiTest for the diagnosis
of NASH. Prevalence of NASH was 17.2% and for possible
NASH 25.7% (Table 1). Concordance rate between
histological NAS score and presumed by NASH test was
33.1% (P,0.0001) but with a weak kappa reliability test =
0.18. Among 110 patients presumed No-Nash by NT, 95 (86%)
were No-Nash, 10 Possible and 5 Nash at biopsy; among 355
presumed Possible-Nash by NT, 176 were No-Nash, 111 (31%)
Possible and 68 Nash at biopsy; among 29 patients presumed
Nash by NT, 11 were No-Nash, 6 Possible and 12 (41%) Nash
at biopsy.
Using quantitative biomarker AT, the wAUROC was highly
significant for the diagnosis of Nash = 0.84 (0.82–0.86; P,0.0001)
significantly greater (Z = 4.6 P,0.0001) than that of ALT, 0.81
(0.80–0.82; P = 0.007).
Figure 1. Included patients with morbid obesity. *In the Lille cohort a total of 296 patients have been excluded, 94 because histological staging
was missing, 19 were duplicate, 229 for biomarkers non assessed (including 39 with more than one cause of exclusion) and 3 patients with not
interpretable FT/ST (extreme value of triglycerides/glucose/ApoA1 detected by security algorithms). In the Paris cohort 6 patients have excluded, 2
with BMI lower than 35, 3 because histological staging was missing, and one for biomarkers not assessed. In the Bethune cohort 8 patients have
excluded, 3 with BMI lower than 35, and 5 because histological staging was missing.

Pairwise comparisons between classes (NoNash/Possible/Nash)
are given in table 2. AT wAUROC was also highly significant in
141 patients with diabetes 0.81 (0.78–0.84; P,0.0001). Classical
AUROC of AT was 0.74 (0.68–0.79; P,0.0001). The AT values
according to each NAS classes are given in Figure 2C.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative(NPV)
predictive values. Diagnostic values according to predeter￾mined cutoffs are detailed in Table 3. For fibrosis the PPV was
87.5% for the diagnosis of Fibrosis .F0 using the 0.27 cutoff and
the NPV for fibrosis .F1 was 93.8% using 0.48 cutoff.
For steatosis the PPV of ST was 92.4% for the diagnosis of
steatosis .S0 using the 0.38 cutoff and the NPV for steatosis .S1
was 59.3% using 0.69 cutoff.
For steato-hepatitis the NPV of AT was 96.0% for the diagnosis
of NASH (NAS.4) using the 0.29 cutoff and the PPV for
Possible/NASH or NASH (NAS.2) was 47.5% using 0.17 cutoff.
Sensitivity analysis of AUROCs (Table S1) and Obuchowski
measures (Table S2) according to the presence of diabetes, gender
and age showed that the performances of FT, AT and ST
remained always highly significant for the diagnosis of advanced
fibrosis by FT and NASH by AT. For ST the AUROC was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes than without.
Meta-analysis of the 3 studies
The pooled results of wAUROCs are shown in Figure 3 for FT

Discussion
This study is the largest analysis of liver biomarkers (FT, ST, AT
and NT) performances in patients with severe obesity. This
overview confirms the accuracy previously observed for the
diagnosis of liver injury in patients with NAFLD [9,11,12] and
in general populations [27,28]. The two new studies (Paris and
Bethune’ cohorts) performed in patients with severe obesity have
confirmed the performances previously observed in the Lille [10].
Advantages of this overview
The main advantage of this overview was an increase of power
in comparison with isolated studies. A large number of patients
was necessary to assess correctly these biomarkers performances as
some classes of liver injury could be too small, such as patients with
advanced fibrosis or patients without advanced steatosis. Indeed
the liver injury spectrum is dramatically different in obese patients
than in liver diseases where FT and ST were originally
constructed. In obese we observed 9.9% of advanced fibrosis,
much lower than the 49.0% observed in patients with chronic
hepatitis C [29]; the prevalence of steatosis (.5%) was 85.9%
much higher than the 45.0% of the initial ST training group [11].
Due to this spectrum effect the use of the Obuchowski measure
was also necessary to prevent misleading interpretation of not
weighted AUROCs [14–16]. With or without standardization, the
AUROCs of FT was 0.85 vs 0.72, ST was 0.80 vs 0.71 and AT
was 0.84 vs 0.74, respectively.
The accuracy of the biomarkers were confirmed using several
statistical methods the integrated data base analysis and the
classical meta-analysis. There was no difference between cohorts
and between patients with or without diabetes.
Limitation of the present study
This population of tertiary centers offering bariatric surgery is
not representative of the general population of severe obese
patients. There was an heterogeneity between the three cohorts
with less metabolic factors in the Betune cohort. The distribution
of the present study sample was taken for he Obuchowski measure
as the present study was the largest study published in severe obese
and there was no recognized reference distribution. Due to the
limited number of patients with advanced fibrosis it was therefore
not possible in the present study to compare the accuracy between
all advanced fibrosis stages. Only 8 (1.6%) patients had a cirrhosis.
This low prevalence of advanced fibrosis was expected as these
obese patients were selected according to the absence of other
recognized risk factors of fibrosis progression: no high alcohol
consumption, predominantly young (42 years old) and females
(77.3%) [21].
ST has limitations as it is mostly a semi quantitative test mostly
designed to be sensitive for excluding steatosis and it cannot not
discriminate severe steatosis (greater than 66%) versus marked
steatosis between 33% to 66%. More quantitative ST should be
developed as severe steatosis represented 20% of these obese
patients versus 34% for marked steatosis (33–66%).
This overview focused on 4 tests developed by several co￾authors of the article, who have an obvious conflict of interest as
inventor or employee of the company marketing these tests.
However the other co-authors were totally independent, recruited
the patients and performed the assay independently of the
company and had a full access to all data and analyses.
Another limitation was the absence of direct comparisons with
other biomarkers such as ELF, Fibrospect, Fibrometer and
Fibroscan for fibrosis, cytokeratin 18 for NASH, and magnetic
resonance imaging and spectroscopy for steatosis [7,8,30]. The
main goal of this study was to validate the performance of these
tests versus random. At least this overview demonstrated that both
ST and AT were significantly more accurate than ALT for the
diagnosis of steatosis and NASH in patients with severe obesity.
There was no difference in the present study between the FT
performance and the ALT performance for the diagnosis of
fibrosis. This absence of significant difference should not be
interpreted as an absence of difference according to the low power
of this comparison. Due to the low prevalence of advanced fibrosis
(9.9%) in obese patients a study comparing FT to other fibrosis
biomarkers would need much more patients. As observed in other
frequent liver disease, ALT is specifically associated with necro￾inflammatory activity grades and therefore must not be used as a

marker of fibrosis [17]. Ideally fibrosis’ biomarkers must be
interpreted together with validated independent biomarker of
activity and steatosis to prevent false positive. Biomarker such as
Fibrometer which included transaminases in its components, had a
variability related to activity.
This overview confirms the significant accuracy of AT for the
diagnosis of overt NASH as well as for the pairwise comparison
between NAS categories, observed by Lassailly et al [10]. The AT
was originally designed for necroinflammatory histological activity
diagnosis in chronic hepatitis C and B. According to the observed
performance in obese patients, it will be interesting to check the
AT performance in patients with other NAFLD risk factors as well
as a comparison or combination of cytokeratin 18 for the diagnosis
of NASH.
Long term prospective studies must be undertaken in patients
with severe obesity and other NAFLD risk factors in order to
validate these biomarkers versus biopsy. In patients with chronic
hepatitis C [31], chronic hepatitis B [32] and alcoholic liver
disease [33] FT had similar the prognostic values than biopsy.
Finally a major limitation of liver biomarkers validation is the
absence of perfect gold standard [19,22]. Using more appropriate
methodology such as latent class analysis looking for truth in the
absence of gold standard is probably one scientific manner to
better estimate the performance of liver biomarkers [34].
Conclusion
In conclusion, as in patients with chronic hepatitis C, B and
alcoholic liver disease, a significant diagnostic performance of
FibroTest, SteatoTest and ActiTest was observed for liver lesions
in patients with severe obesity.
