HOW I DO IT
Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt
Brian Funaki, M.D.1
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS) insertion is among the most technically challeng￾ing procedures in interventional radiology. It combines
many of the skills used in other procedures such as venous
access, biopsy, angioplasty, and stent-graft insertion into
one IR tour de force. A great deal of literature is devoted
to patient selection, technical aspects of the procedure,
and utility of the procedure in different disease processes.
This article describes the technical aspects of a so-called
generic TIPS procedure. I focus on an otherwise uncom￾plicated procedure (if that actually exists) and leave the
article on tough TIPS for another issue.
PREPROCEDURE
All coagulopathies should be corrected as much as
possible. As a general rule, TIPS procedures at night
are unnecessary except in rare circumstances. It is my bias
that most patients who will not survive the night without
a TIPS will not survive long with one either. I am
fortunate to be a part of a multidisciplinary liver team
at my medical center; the pros and cons of TIPS are
deliberated for all candidates. When I am consulted for a
TIPS, there is rarely need for further discussion. De￾pending on your referral services, you may need to
evaluate all patients carefully for indications and contra￾indications. All the TIPS procedures at the University of
Chicago are performed with sedation managed by the
department of anesthesia; most are done with general
anesthesia. We have followed this algorithm since 1992
and believe the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages.
When anesthesiologists handle sedation, procedural
patient pain control and cooperation is optimized, un￾expected problems with airway or fluid requirements are
handled expeditiously, and interventional radiologists
are able to focus on the task at hand.
Cross-sectional imaging should be performed and
is nearly always available in 2008. Having a blueprint of
the relevant anatomy eliminates surprises and allows
accurate preprocedural planning. Patients with perihe￾patic ascites should have it drained immediately prior to
the procedure. Capsular punctures are common in TIPS
procedures, so eliminating the fluid surrounding the liver
may limit the risk of significant perihepatic bleeding, and
it prevents a firm fibrotic liver from turning away, as it
were, during puncture attempts. We typically place a 5F
angiographic pigtail catheter into the ascites and attach
it to a vacuum suction bottle and drain between 1 to 2 L
of fluid. The pigtail catheter is left in place during the
procedure, which enables early recognition of extracap￾sular punctures (i.e., bloody ascites is aspirated).
A model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score
should be calculated. Patients with scores > 25 have a
dismal prognosis with a significant risk of early mortality
(approximately two of three patients will not survive
3 months). This should be discussed with referring
clinical service as well as during informed consent. You
can access a MELD score calculator at http://www.
unos.org/resources/meldpeldcalculator.asp.
CHOICE OF EQUIPMENT
Most of my experience is with a Rosch-Uchida set
(Cook, Bloomington, IN), and I use it preferentially.
Anecdotally, the Ring set (also made by Cook) may be
helpful for particularly hard cirrhotic livers, and the
Angiodynamics set (Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY)
can be helpful in patients with Budd-Chiari in whom a
long tract is needed to bridge the hepatic vein and portal
vein. Other must-haves include the following:
 Rigid 0.035-inch guidewires (e.g., Amplatz Super￾stiff; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA)
 Hydrophilic guidewires
 Angioplasty balloons (from 4- to 12-mm diameter)
 Bare and covered stents (e.g., Wallstents; Boston Sci￾entific, and Viatorr stent grafts; Gore, Flagstaff, AZ)
 Calibrated pigtail catheter
 Hydrophilic 4F catheters (any shape)
 Conventional 5F catheters in a variety of shapes (e.g.,
RC-1, Cobra, MPA, etc.)
 10 to 12F long sheaths

PROCEDURE
Access Site
In my experience, both left and right internal jugular vein
punctures may be used successfully for TIPS, and choice
is typically personal preference. Each has advantages and
disadvantages. My general preference is the right internal
jugular vein 1 cm above the clavicle—the same spot as
central venous access. Higher punctures are less desirable
because it is more difficult to torque the top of the sheath
leftward (which is necessary to push the tip of the guiding
sheath rightward for difficult punctures in patients with
small cirrhotic livers). The left internal jugular vein also
has both merits and drawbacks: It is generally easier to
make punctures into the liver from a left-sided approach
because mechanical advantage is maximized. However,
once the portal vein is accessed, it is slightly more
cumbersome to advance balloons, sheaths, and stents
back around the curved track to the midline.
Hepatic Vein Catheterization and Venography
Essentially, all patients in my practice have had a prior
computed tomography (CT) examination that should be
reviewed before the procedure. This enables proper
planning of access route and allows recognition of variant
anatomy or pitfalls such as a large recanalized periumbil￾ical vein. I do not routinely perform ‘‘wedged’’ portal
venography—I have never found this practice particularly
useful. It is associated with a small risk of capsular
perforation, which can be fatal and (in my view) should
be unnecessary in the majority of cases if a good-quality
CT examination is available. In the uncommon case
when it is necessary, it should be performed using carbon
dioxide injected via an occlusion balloon inflated in the
right hepatic artery several centimeters from the hepatic
vein/inferior vena cava (IVC) confluence. The hepatic
vein is catheterized to ensure patency and provides a
visual landmark from which to initiate liver punctures.
Portal Vein Puncture
The curved guiding sheath is advanced into the hepatic
vein orifice, turned slightly anterior, and the needle￾catheter is advanced into the liver toward the portal vein.
A few caveats should be remembered during this ma￾neuver. First, punctures should be initially made from
the central-most portion of the hepatic vein (i.e., near
the hepatic vein confluence) rather than more periph￾erally because this will result is a relatively straight course
for the shunt, which is usually best for long-term patency
and facilitates passing balloons and stent grafts into the
liver. Second, the portal triads in patients with cirrhosis
are usually quite fibrotic. Therefore, you can encounter a
great deal of resistance that can cause the needle-catheter
combination to buckle as punctures are made. If you
don’t feel resistance during a needle pass in a patient with
cirrhosis, it is unlikely you have entered the portal vein.
Third, the curved sheath may need to be slightly wedged
into the hepatic vein orifice to facilitate passage of the
catheter-needle into the liver. Finally, punctures from
the right hepatic vein are made anteriorly, and punctures
from the middle hepatic vein are made posteriorly. It is
critical to recognize which hepatic vein is catheterized.
After the needle-catheter is advanced toward the
portal vein, the needle is removed, a 5-mL syringe with a
50/50 mixture of contrast and saline is attached to the
hub of the catheter, and the catheter is slowly retracted
while aspirating. If blood is aspirated, contrast is injected
to determine what has been punctured: portal vein
(good), hepatic vein (not good), or hepatic artery
(bad). Hepatic vein and artery punctures usually have
no adverse sequelae. Typically, the portal vein is either
entered within 5 minutes (3 to 4 passes) or it takes an
hour or more and 50 to 100 passes. This portion of the
procedure takes luck and patience. It is important to
review the CT examination again to direct punctures to
the intended target. In particularly difficult cases, an
assortment of maneuvers such as percutaneous portal
vein localization, ‘‘gun-sight’’ TIPS, and intravascular
ultrasound-guided direct portal vein punctures can be
attempted, which are beyond the scope of this article.
Once the portal vein is entered, a portal venogram
is performed to determine the entry site into the portal
vein (Figs. 1A,B). Punctures into the main portal vein
should be abandoned because this portion of the vein is
extrahepatic.
Tract Dilation and Pressure Measurement
Once a suitable entry site is secured, a guidewire is
advanced into the main portal vein and into either the
splenic vein or superior mesenteric vein. A hydrophilic
guide wire is helpful for difficult access cases, but I usually
start with a Bentson wire. Portal pressure measurements
are obtained and a rigid guidewire such as an Amplatz
Superstiff wire is positioned with its tip in either the
splenic or superior mesenteric vein. A 6- to 8-mm
angioplasty balloon is then used to predilate the tract
(Figs. 1C,D). If the passage of this balloon proves
difficult, a smaller balloon can be chosen or the tract can
be Dottered using the curved guiding sheath. This latter
maneuver should be done with caution. If the puncture
site is extrahepatic, this can result in portal vein laceration
with catastrophic consequences. Upon dilation, two
waists will be identified on the angioplasty balloon. The
more cephalad waist marks the exit site of the hepatic vein,
and the more caudal represents the entry site into the
portal vein.
After tract predilation, a calibrated pigtail cathe￾ter is positioned into the portal vein to perform portal
venography (Fig. 1E). During the angiogram, contrast

material is first injected into the calibrated pigtail cath￾eter, followed by injection of the sheath, which should be
positioned at the hepatic vein/IVC orifice. The tract is
then measured from portal vein entry site to the hepatic
vein/IVC junction using the calibrated catheter. A
Viatorr stent graft, which is 1 cm longer than the
measured distance, is chosen for deployment (e.g., if
the tract measures 6 cm, use a 7-cm-long stent graft). I
empirically choose a 10-mm-diameter stent graft and
postdilate the graft to 8 mm using an 8 mm
diameter  4 cm long angioplasty balloon catheter.
Stent Graft Deployment
The outer sheath is then advanced into the portal vein
using the inner dilator portion to lead or simply advancing
it over an angioplasty balloon catheter. A Viatorr stent
graft is loaded into the sheath and advanced to the end of
the sheath (Fig. 1F). The sheath is then retracted into the
IVC while holding the stent graft in position to deploy
the distal uncovered end of the device (Fig. 1G). Re￾member to pull the sheath all the way back into the IVC
or you will risk deploying the stent graft in the sheath.
The stent graft is pulled back to the entry site of the portal
vein or until the end of the graft is at the desired position
of the hepatic vein/IVC junction and deployed by pulling
the ripcord (Fig. 1H). I postdilate the graft using an
8-mm balloon and repeat pressure measurements and
venography (Fig. 1I). I stop if the gradient is  12 mm
Hg. The covered end of the graft should extend to the
IVC and even into the IVC slightly. Grafts that are not
positioned to cover the hepatic vein completely are prone
to early stenosis and occlusion (Fig. 2). As a general rule,
I do not embolize varices. In the vast majority of cases,
varices should not fill if the shunt is functioning
adequately. If I see continued filling of varices, I redilate
TIPS prior to attempting embolization with coils.
POSTPROCEDURE

cannot be performed for several days after the stent graft

is inserted. This has been attributed to air that is trapped
within the encapsulated layers of the device. We have
stopped routinely obtaining this examination because
early thrombosis is exceedingly rare with the elimination
of biliary-to-TIPS fistulae. Patients are monitored
overnight in the intensive care unit and transferred or
discharged from the hospital as their condition permits.
We obtain follow-up ultrasound examinations at 1, 3,
6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
DISCUSSION
TIPS has become an excellent treatment modality for
several disorders including refractory variceal hemor￾rhage, refractory ascites, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and
hepatic hydrothorax. When I trained, most of our
TIPS procedures were for variceal hemorrhage unre￾sponsive to endoscopic and medical management. This
led to many procedures being performed as a last resort
in less than optimal conditions. Not surprisingly, many
of these patients fared poorly even with successful
procedures.
In my current practice, we have increasingly
used shunts for refractory ascites. This shift in practice
has translated into many more elective TIPS proce￾dures rather than emergent ones. Increasingly,
randomized trials are showing the efficacy of TIPS
in refractory ascites, and some have shown a survival

advantage, although this topic remains controversial.
In my opinion, TIPS should be the treatment of
choice in patients with refractory ascites who have
low MELD scores. It should be used cautiously in
others, especially in those with relatively advanced
liver disease.
The two main limitations of TIPS have been
shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy. Covered
stents have helped address the first liability and improved
long-term patency. Covered stents should be used rou￾tinely for all procedures (Fig. 3). Bare stents may be used
when decompression of the portal system is needed
urgently (e.g., active hematemesis during the procedure)
because these devices are technically easier to insert
relatively quickly. Hepatic encephalopathy can be man￾aged successfully in > 90% of patients with medical
therapy, but those for whom medical therapy fails have
a poor prognosis.
