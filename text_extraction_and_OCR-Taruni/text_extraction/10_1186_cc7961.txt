Abstract
We summarize original research in the field of critical care
nephrology accepted or published during 2008 in Critical Care
and, when considered relevant or directly linked to this research, in
other journals. Three main topics have been identified for a rapid
overview. (1) The classification of acute kidney injury, with particu￾lar attention to differences and similarities between the RIFLE and
AKIN classifications. (2) Fluid balance in patients requiring renal
replacement therapy (RRT) has been shown as an independent
risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients: current evidence and
uncertainties are described. (3) Management of anticoagulation
during RRT has been explored by several researchers in 2008:
diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the use of
tirofiban and optimal anticoagulation during drotrecogin A acti￾vated treatment have been evaluated.
Classification
Steinvall and colleagues conducted a cohort study on
patients with a percentage burned total body surface area of
20% or more [1]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was classified
according to the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function,
and End-stage (RIFLE) kidney disease international
consensus classification [2]. They evaluated 127 patients,
which corresponded to 0.11 per 100,000 people per year.
Of these, 31 patients (24%) developed AKI (12% Risk, 8%
Injury, and 5% Failure) and four patients (3%) required
dialysis. The mean age was 40.6 years, the percentage
burned total body surface area was 38.6%, and 25% were
women. Renal dysfunction occurred within 7 days in 55% of
the patients and after 7 days in the remainder. AKI recovered
among all survivors. Age, percentage burned total body
surface area, and extent of full-thickness burns were higher
among the patients who developed AKI. Pulmonary
dysfunction and systemic inflammatory response syndrome
were present in all of the patients with AKI and developed
before AKI onset. Sepsis was a possible aggravating factor in
AKI in 48% of patients. Extensive deep burns (25% or more
full-thickness burn) increased the risk for developing early AKI
(risk ratio, 2.25). Mortality was 14% and, interestingly,
increased with increasing RIFLE class (7% normal, 13% Risk,
40% Injury, and 83% Failure).
As the accompanying editorial correctly points out [3], even if
the number of patients generally evaluated in post-burn AKI
studies is generally low, the analysis from Steinvall and
colleagues relates to another two studies on this subject
[4,5]: all three studies confirmed that increasing RIFLE class
was associated with a stepwise increase of mortality. The
incidence of AKI in the studies of Coca and colleagues and
of Steinvall and colleagues (26.6% and 24.4%, respectively),
however, was significantly lower than that of Lopes and
colleagues (35.7% incidence). This difference might be
explained by the fact that Lopes and colleagues classified
patients according to the original RIFLE classification, on
both urine output and serum creatinine concentration [4], in
contrast to the studies by Steinvall and colleagues and by
Coca and colleagues, which only used serum creatinine [1,5].
In burn patients, serum creatinine levels make interpretation
of kidney function particularly challenging: the early rise of
creatinine concentration secondary to large muscle injury
might cause an underestimation of kidney function. On the
other side, the fundamental therapy of burned patients is
large-volume resuscitation to compensate for the massive
fluid losses and decreased effective circulating volume. This
may lead to hemodilution, and to false low serum creatinine
concentrations that do not reflect true kidney function. Finally,
catabolism, leading to loss of muscle mass, may also contribute
to low serum concentrations since less muscle mass will result
in lower serum creatinine concentrations for the same
glomerular filtration rate.
Another interesting point raised but still not fully addressed
by these studies is AKI physiopathology and therapy.

Interestingly, Steinvall and colleagues found that approxi￾mately one-half of patients developed AKI during the first
week and the other half developed AKI during the next week
[1]. Apparently, the burn shock resuscitation schedule used
was successful in preventing AKI in the very early phase of
the disease. Burn shock is not the only cause of AKI,
however, and inflammatory mechanisms may be responsible
for late AKI and multiple organ failure. In their cohort, Steinvall
and coauthors only treated four patients with renal
replacement therapy (RRT), who were the most severely ill of
the studied population: it might be interesting to explore the
feasibility of RRT in all post-burn late AKI patients. An
interesting study on this subject has been published online
while we were writing [6], and will be probably commented
on in the next issue of ‘Year in review 2009: Critical Care -
Nephrology’.
One of the major merits of AKI classifications, as shown in
burn studies, is to allow epidemiology comparisons among
different authors. As long as new data will be provided by
studies on incidence, prognosis and therapy of AKI, a sort of
multinational database is created where information found by
different centers can be easily meta-analyzed and the
knowledge on acute renal dysfunction increased [7].
An interesting contribution to this group of studies has been
presented by Ostermann and coauthors [8]: the authors tried
to apply the AKI classification proposed by the Acute Kidney
Injury Network (AKIN) in September 2005 [9] to 22,303 adult
patients admitted to 22 intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK
and Germany between 1989 and 1999, who stayed in the
ICU for 24 hours or longer and did not have end-stage
dialysis-dependent renal failure. Of the patients, 7,898
(35.4%) fulfilled the criteria for AKI (19.1% had AKI I, 3.8%
had AKI II and 12.5% had AKI III). RRT was delivered to 848
(4.6%) patients. Without RRT as a criterion, 21% of patients
classified as AKI III would have been classified as AKI II or
AKI I. Mortality in the ICU was 10.7% in patients with no AKI,
20.1% in AKI I patients, 25.9% in AKI II patients and 49.6%
in AKI III patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed that AKI III,
but not AKI I and AKI II, was independently associated with
ICU mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 2.27). Other independent
risk factors for ICU mortality were age (OR = 1.03),
sequential organ failure assessment score on admission to
the ICU (OR = 1.11), pre-existing end-stage chronic health
(OR = 1.65), emergency surgery (OR = 2.33), mechanical
ventilation (OR = 2.83), maximum number of failed organ
systems (OR = 2.80) and nonsurgical admission (OR =
3.57). Cardiac surgery, AKI I and RRT were associated with a
reduced risk of dying in the ICU. AKI II was not an
independent risk factor for ICU mortality. According to these
authors, RRT as a criterion for AKI III may inadvertently
diminish the predictive power of the classification.
Ostermann and colleagues’ study is limited by the fact that
data were collected during a relatively long period (10 years)
that dates from 20 years ago to about 10 years ago. It is
possible that, even though the crude mortality of AKI patients
has probably not changed significantly since 1989, capa￾bilities have certainly improved and the healthcare system has
progressively admitted and treated sicker patients with AKI.
Even if the authors acknowledge the possible effect of such
an old database on outcome, they might not have correctly
estimated the change of illness severity and of eventual
treatment strategies: hence, similar data collection from the
year 2000 to the present day might have provided different
results. The authors did present, however, some limits of the
AKIN classification with respect to the RIFLE classification. In
their analysis, Ostermann and coauthors found that 2,014
patients classified as having no AKI had serum creatinine
levels >140 μmol/l; 316 patients even had serum creatinine
values >270 μmol/l. Although it is possible these patients
may have had a degree of pre-existing chronic kidney
disease, it is also possible that they had AKI without the
necessary changes in serum creatinine within the required
time period. Using the RIFLE classification that suggested a
1-week timeframe instead of the 48-hour timeframe proposed
for the AKIN scale, Ostermann and colleagues found a higher
incidence of AKI (39.5% instead of 34.4%; AKI I, 19.3%; AKI
II, 6.7%; AKI III, 13.5%). The ICU mortality would have altered
only slightly with the change of timeframe (AKI I, 21.0%; AKI II,
24.9%; AKI III, 49.0%). Furthermore, the authors suggested
that utilization of RRT as a criterion for AKI III might not be
objective and may have had a confounding effect on the
predictive power of the classification system as a whole. It
must be said that this effect might be due to a particularly
aggressive strategy of the authors, who probably treated AKI
with RRT at very early stages of the disease: the protective
effect of RRT on mortality found by Ostermann and colleagues
on multivariate analysis interestingly confirms this assumption.
As already reported last year [10], a large retrospective
analysis of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care
Society database [11] compared RIFLE and AKIN classifi￾cation in the first 24 hours after admission to the ICU. Even if
these classifications were not conceived to be used only in
the first 24 hours of admission, the authors found that
estimates of prevalence and crude mortality were very similar
between the two classification schemes, and concluded that –
compared with the RIFLE criteria – the AKIN criteria did not
substantially improve the sensitivity, robustness and
predictive ability of the definition and classification of AKI.
Lopes and coauthors also evaluated the incidence of AKI and
compared the ability of the maximum RIFLE and of the
maximum AKIN within ICU hospitalization in predicting
inhospital mortality of critically ill patients [12]. Critically ill
patients admitted between January 2003 and December
2006 were retrospectively evaluated. Chronic kidney disease
patients undergoing dialysis or renal transplant patients were
excluded from the analysis. In total, 662 patients (mean age,
58.6 ± 19.2 years; 40% females) were evaluated. Different

from Ostermann and colleagues, the AKIN criteria allowed
the identification of more AKI patients than the RIFLE criteria
(50.4% vs. 43.8%, P = 0.018) and classified more patients
with Stage 1 (Risk in RIFLE) (21.1% vs. 14.7%, P = 0.003),
but no differences were observed for Stage 2 (Injury in
RIFLE) (10.1% vs. 11%, P = 0.655) and for Stage 3 (Failure
in RIFLE) (19.2% vs. 18.1%, P = 0.672). Mortality was signifi￾cantly higher for AKI patients defined by any of the RIFLE
criteria (41.3% vs. 11%, P < 0.0001; OR = 2.78, 95% confi￾dence interval = 1.74 to 4.45, P < 0.0001) or of the AKIN
criteria (39.8% vs. 8.5%, P < 0.0001; OR = 3.59, 95%
confidence interval = 2.14 to 6.01, P < 0.0001) with respect
to non-AKI patients. The area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve for inhospital mortality was 0.733 for
RIFLE criteria (P < 0.0001) and was 0.750 for AKIN criteria
(P < 0.0001). There were no statistical differences in mortality
by the AKI definition/classification criteria (P = 0.72).
Agreeing with previous authors, Lopes and authors
concluded that although the AKIN criteria could improve the
sensitivity of the AKI diagnosis, they did not seem to improve
on the RIFLE criteria in predicting inhospital mortality of
critically ill patients [12]. Interestingly, the authors showed
that serum creatinine criteria seemed to be a better predictor
of mortality than urine output. In fact, in >60% of patients with
AKI, the creatinine criteria led to a worse RIFLE class or AKIN
stage than urine output. Creatinine is also an easier marker to
be recalled in retrospective studies, and an objective number
to be reported in databases: this may also explain why the
role of urine output for AKI diagnosis might be under￾estimated by epidemiologic studies. Owing to the routinely
generous utilization of loop diuretics that modify the true urine
output of dysfunctioning kidneys and the possibility of an
early diagnosis offered by new serum biomarkers [13],
however, it seems that AKI classifications should soon imple￾ment these molecules in their schemes.
It must be remarked that in recent years the use of the
consensus definitions of AKI (RIFLE and AKIN) in the
literature has increased substantially [7,10]. This increase has
indicated a high acceptance by the medical community of a
common way to identify and classify AKI. Some variation in
how the criteria are interpreted and used in the literature still
includes urine output criteria, use of the change in the
estimated glomerular filtration rate rather than the change in
creatinine, and choice of baseline creatinine. It is imperative
to recognize that no single definition will be perfect.
Furthermore, it must be admitted that, at present, RIFLE
criteria have not been shown to be significantly superior to
AKIN criteria and reported differences are very minor. A
logical process would therefore now be to reconcile existing
definitions, moving the medical community towards using a
single consensus definition – as has been done for
syndromes such as sepsis and acute lung injury. Integration
of novel biomarkers into the final consensus definition will be
an outstanding improvement. The next step will be for some
research to test the use of such classifications on different
interventions of AKI therapy in order to guide clinicians
towards the best possible standard of AKI care.
Fluid balance
As has been clearly shown, AKI is an independent cause of
mortality in critically ill patients. Creatinine is not the only
marker correlating to this risk, patient fluid balance being
another key parameter to consider and possibly treat.
Payen and coauthors [14], utilizing data from the Sepsis
Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients study, analyzed the
influence of patient characteristics and fluid balance on the
outcome of AKI in ICU patients. The Sepsis Occurrence in
Acutely Ill Patients study is a multicenter observational cohort
study: 198 ICUs from 24 European countries gave their
contribution to its realization. For Payen and colleagues’
analysis, patients were divided into two groups according to
whether they had AKI. Of the 3,147 patients included in the
Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients study, 1,120 (36%)
had AKI at some point during their ICU stay. Sixty-day mortality
rates were 36% in patients with AKI and 16% in patients
without. Oliguric patients and patients treated with RRT had
higher 60-day mortality rates than patients without oliguria or
without the need for RRT. Independent risk factors for 60-day
mortality in the patients with AKI were age, Simplified Acute
Physiology Score II, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, medical
admission, mean fluid balance, and need for mechanical
ventilation. Among patients treated with RRT, the length of
stay and mortality were lower when RRT was started early
(<48 hours from ICU admission). According to these authors,
a positive fluid balance and late RRT start were important
factors associated with increased 60-day mortality.
Several studies previously showed a statistical difference in
the percentage of fluid overload among children with severe
renal dysfunction requiring RRT [15,16]. At the time of
dialysis initiation, surviving children tended to have less fluid
overload than nonsurvivors, especially in the setting of mul￾tiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Fluid balance is probably
underestimated in critically ill adults where a huge fluid
volume amount is infused in order to target hypovolemia and
organ perfusion. Few clinical investigations, until now, have
evaluated the impact that fluid balance has on clinical
outcomes in critically ill adults with AKI. These data strongly
support the view that there is a survival benefit from early
initiation of continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT)
to prevent fluid accumulation and overload in critically ill
patients, once initial fluid resuscitative management has been
accomplished [17]. Moreover, this would suggest that
prevention or management of fluid overload is evolving as a
primary trigger/indicator for extracorporeal fluid removal, and
this may be independent of dose delivery or solute clearance.
This concept is also supported by the recent Acute Renal
Failure Trial Network trial [18] that was specifically based on

the hemodynamic stability of patients: in both study groups,
hemodynamically stable patients underwent intermittent
hemodialysis, and hemodynamically unstable patients under￾went continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration or sustained
low-efficiency dialysis. Interestingly, net ultrafiltration of
patients undergoing intermittent techniques (<2 l/day) was
apparently lower than that of patients undergoing continuous
venovenous hemodiafiltration (130 ml/hour or 2.7 l/day,
considering a median daily duration of therapy of 21 hours).
In particular, a (nonsignificant) difference was present
between net ultrafiltration of intense intermittent hemodialysis
versus less intense intermittent hemodialysis (1.7 vs. 2.1 l/day),
whereas intense continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration
had very similar ultrafiltration rates compared with less
intense continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (130 vs.
130 ml/hour). Since hypotension events were significantly
higher in the group treated with a higher RRT intensity, it
might be speculated that these events were correlated with
an excessively rapid fluid (and solute) shift of intermittent
therapies, which did not allow adequate fluid balance control.
For this reason, patients allocated to alternate-day, less￾intensive hemodialysis not uncommonly had inadequate fluid
volume control necessitating additional off-protocol ultra￾filtration sessions.
The obtained evidence warrants the need for a prospective
trial that targets fluid balance as the main outcome. We need
to understand whether it is possible to apply RRT actively and
in a timely manner, rather than only utilizing it as rescue
therapy (fluid overload associated with pulmonary edema)
[19]. We well know that this result might not be easily
obtained: it is possible that more severely ill patients are
those who receive the relatively higher amount of fluids, and
this could explain, as an effect and not as a cause, the more
positive fluid balance of nonsurviving patients. If it is evident
that counterbalancing fluid accumulation, particularly in
patients with oliguria or AKI, might be beneficial, then it is
also clear that more severely ill patients might often miss any
active attempt at achieving a negative balance.
Anticoagulation
In 2008 numerous articles published in Critical Care focused
attention on the physiopathology of anticoagulation and
optimization of filter patency, a critical point of acute RRT. In
particular, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a
severe clinical picture, caused by a heparin-induced antibody
that binds to the heparin–PF4 complex on the platelet
surface. HIT is associated with a significant reduction of
platelet number and a procoagulant state, and with eventual
systemic thrombosis. The HIT incidence in critically ill patients
is relatively low, around 0.5% [20], but it is destined to
increase due to the great diffusion of extracorporeal
techniques for organ support.
Lasocki and coworkers [21] retrospectively analyzed 28
patients who were tested for the presence of anti-PF4/
heparin antibodies due to repeated hemofiltration-filter
clotting. Seven patients were positive for anti-PF4/heparin
antibodies and 21 patients were antibody-negative. Baseline
characteristics, platelet counts, and activated partial
thromboplastin time ratios were not different between the two
groups. The continuous venovenous hemofiltration duration
was significantly decreased in antibody-positive patients (5.0
vs. 12.0 hours; P = 0.007), as was the hemofiltration
efficiency (urea reduction ratio 17% vs. 44%; P = 0.04) on
heparin infusion. The anti-PF4/heparin antibody concentration
was inversely correlated with the duration of continuous veno￾venous hemofiltration. The receiver operating characteristic
curve showed that a 6-hour cutoff point was the best
continuous venovenous hemofiltration session duration to
predict a positive antibody test (sensitivity, 71%; specificity,
85%; and area under the curve, 0.83). The continuous
venovenous hemofiltration duration (32 hours; P < 0.05) and
the urea reduction ratio (55%; P < 0.03) were restored by
danaparoid sodium infusion. The authors suggest that
repeated hemofiltration-filter clotting in less than 6 hours may
be reasonably associated with the presence of anti-PF4/
heparin antibodies, regardless of the platelet count. In
antibody-positive patients, replacement of heparin by
danaparoid sodium allowed the restoration of the hemo￾filtration duration and efficiency.
A similar clinical approach for systemic heparin utilization and
HIT diagnosis was proposed by Warkentin some years ago
and was recently reproposed [22,23]. The so-called 4Ts
score (thrombocytopenia, timing, thrombosis, other causes of
thrombocytopenia) (see Table 1) was recently utilized in a
series of 256 HIT referrals [24], and showed that none of the
patients with a low 4Ts score proceeded to an ultimate
diagnosis of HIT. While it is important to identify those
patients with HIT, it is equally important to minimize the
number in whom HIT cannot be adequately excluded. In
cases where the diagnosis still remains in doubt, however, it
is preferable and safer to manage the patients as possible
HIT cases and alter the anticoagulation.
In the light of platelet protection, Link and coauthors
evaluated the reversible effects of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
receptor inhibitor tirofiban to preserve platelet number and
activation in a small prospective open-blinded study [25]. The
contact of blood with surfaces of the extracorporeal
membrane circuits and different anticoagulants leads to
platelet and leukocyte activation and to platelet–leukocyte
coaggregation. All of these interactions result in glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa receptor activation that becomes capable of binding
soluble fibrinogen. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists
primarily act on the platelet surface by inhibition of fibrinogen
binding that is essential for platelet bridging and aggregate
formation. The hypothesis that tirofiban preserves platelet
number and function and shortens postoperative bleeding
times was previously described in patients with type II HIT
during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [26]. Forty patients

with cardiogenic shock and AKI requiring CRRT were
randomly assigned to two groups receiving unfractionated
heparin (n = 20) or a combined anticoagulation with un￾fractionated heparin and tirofiban (n = 20). The primary
endpoint was platelet loss during CRRT. Secondary end￾points were urea reduction, hemofilter life span, bleeding
events, and necessity for platelet transfusions. In unfrac￾tionated heparin-treated patients, the percentage of platelet–
monocyte aggregates significantly increased (P < 0.001) and
consecutively the platelet cell count significantly decreased
(P < 0.001). In contrast, combined treatment with unfraction￾ated heparin and tirofiban significantly decreased platelet–
monocyte aggregates and platelet numbers (P < 0.001).
There were no significant differences between the groups
regarding the efficacy of CRRT, the hemofilter lifespan, or
bleeding events. Platelet transfusions were only necessary in
three patients of the unfractionated heparin group.
As correctly pointed out in the accompanying editorial [27],
the study by Link and colleagues showed that tirofiban
prevents platelet activation and loss during CRRT. The data
indicated a significantly reduced platelet loss with additional
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist therapy compared with un￾fractionated heparin therapy alone. Owing to the small
sample size, however, the potential impact of additional treat￾ment variables (such as the concomitant and significantly
variable administration of other anticoagulants, antiplatelet
drugs or catecholamines and the presence of polysulphone
CRRT membranes) could not be clarified. A substantially
larger, adequately powered study is therefore warranted
before these results can be generalized.
Camporota and coworkers [28] also addressed the
importance of anticoagulation management during CRRT,
particularly analyzing a cohort of patients who simultaneously
received renal replacement and drotrecogin A activated
(DrotAA). A single-center, retrospective observational study
was conducted in an adult ICU. Thirty-five patients were
identified. The proportion of filter changes due to filter clotting
was similar during DrotAA infusion and with conventional
anticoagulation post DrotAA infusion. There was no
difference in the filter survival time and filter parameters
during DrotAA treatment in the presence or absence of
additional anticoagulation with heparin or epoprostenol. Red
blood cell transfusion was not different among the different
anticoagulant strategies, although a greater proportion of
patients received platelet and fresh-frozen plasma during
DrotAA infusion compared with the post-DrotAA period, with
no difference between medical and surgical patients.
Camporota and colleagues concluded that additional
anticoagulation during DrotAA infusion does not appear to
improve the filter survival time. The use of DrotAA in patients
with severe sepsis requiring RRT is safe and is not
associated with major bleeding events. Furthermore, in a
multivariate logistic regression analysis, the authors identified
the minimum value in platelet count as the only predictive
factor of filter clotting during DrotAA infusion.
Camporota and colleagues’ study is interesting and confirms
previous observations that no additional anticoagulation is
necessary during simultaneous DrotAA infusion and CRRT.
The only information that should be interpreted with caution is
the authors’ finding that no difference in red blood cell
requirements was found, either between DrotAA filters and
post-DrotAA filters or between medical patients and surgical
patients. It should be remembered that, among the 4,459
patients included in the International Integrated Database for
the Evaluation of Severe Sepsis and Drotrecogin alfa
