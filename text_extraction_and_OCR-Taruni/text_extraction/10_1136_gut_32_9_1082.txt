Transplantation of a donor liver with
haemochromatosis: evidence against an inherited
intrahepatic defect
P C Adams, C N Ghent, D R Grant, J V Frei, WJ Wall
Abstract
An iron loaded liver from a 40 year old man
with occult haemochromatosis was trans￾planted into a 19 year old woman with acute
liver failure secondary to a paracetamol over￾dose. Increased parenchymal hepatic iron was
found in a liver specimen at biopsy undertaken
because of mild rejection 30 days after trans￾plantation. After transplantation the patient
had two episodes of liver rejection confirmed
by biopsy. The hepatic iron concentration fell
from 161 ,mol/g on day 30 after transplant to
26.5 imol/g (normal <40) on day 210. Iron
absorption, measured 45 days after transplant,
was in the normal range at 12-4%. The rapid
fall in hepatic iron and the normal iron absorp￾tion study result suggest that the genetic defect
of haemochromatosis is not exclusively an
intrahepatic defect.

Haemochromatosis is a genetic disease of
unknown cause that affects approximately one in
400 of the white population.' The disease is
characterised by increased intestinal absorption
of iron that eventually leads to parenchymal iron
deposition in the liver, pancreas, and heart.
Organ damage and clinical symptoms do not
usually appear until the fifth decade in men and
the sixth decade in women.2 Theories on the
pathogenesis of haemochromatosis have postu￾lated that the primary metabolic defect is in the
intestinal mucosa,15 the reticuloendothelial
system,6 or the liver.7 8 In this report, we describe
the indirect evidence against an intrahepatic
defect as the primary defect in haemochromato￾Figure 1: Liver biopsy specimen taken from recipient ofiron loaded liver 30 days after

sis provided by inadvertent transplantation of a
liver from a patient with haemochromatosis.
Patients and methods
The donor was a 40 year old Irish man who had a
spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage. He had a
past history of mild arthritis affecting his hands
and shoulders, unexplained dyspnoea on
exertion, and a two year history of impotence.
There was no history of anaemia, transfusions,
or alcohol abuse. Serum, tested posthumously,
showed a raised serum ferritin concentration of
1436 ,ug/l (normal range= 15-300). The heart
was not used for transplantation because it
looked hypokinetic. A necropsy was not per￾formed.
The recipient was a 19 year old woman who
developed acute hepatic failure after ingesting
approximately 15 g of paracetamol. She under￾went emergency orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion receiving 4 U of packed red blood cells.
The patient made an excellent postoperative
recovery. A percutaneous liver biopsy was per￾formed on day 30 after transplantation because
of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase and
alanine aminotransferase activities. The biopsy
specimen confirmed a diagnosis of acute rejec￾tion. An iron stain (Perls' stain) showed 4+ iron
in the hepatocytes,9 with minimal iron in the
Kupffer cells and no fibrosis or cirrhosis (Fig 1).
Hepatic iron determination by atomic absorp￾tion spectrophotometry'° showed a considerable
increase in hepatic iron at 161 [tmol/g (normal
range 0-40 [imol/g dry weight). The estimated
hepatic iron index (hepatic iron-age) in the donor
was 4 0 which is highly suggestive of genetic
haemochromatosis.'°0" Rejection was readily
controlled with intravenous methylprednisolone
therapy. The serum ferritin value was 2940 ,ug/l
on day 30 and had fallen to 243 [ig/l by day 570.
An iron absorption study was performed on day
45 using an oral dose of 1 pCi 59Fe citrate
containing 10 ,umol of ferrous ascorbate. The
retained dose of 59Fe at 14 days was calculated
with a total body counter.'2 At the time of the
iron absorption study the patient had a haemo￾globin concentration of 115 g/l and a transferrin
saturation value of 23%. The iron absorption was
12-4%, which is within normal limits. However,
iron absorption is not a diagnostic test for
haemochromatosis and the wide range of values
for normal volunteers and haemochromatosis
patients has been previously described.'2'I The
iron absorption study result in this patient is
much less than would be expected for a
haemochromatosis patient of this age.'3 The
patient was readmitted to hospital on day 65 and

day 87 because of biochemical evidence of liver
rejection which was confirmed by liver biopsy.
Her hepatic iron concentrations were 68 nmol/g
and 45 4 imol/g on days 65 and 87 respectively.
A biopsy specimen taken on day 210 showed that
the hepatic iron had decreased to within the
normal .range at 26 5 tmol/g, and iron staining
showed minimal iron within Kupffer cells, with
no demonstrable staining of parenchymal iron.
The hepatic iron concentrations, measured on
four occasions, are shown in Figure 2.
Discussion
This case documents the unusual occurrence of
the transplantation of an iron loaded haemochro￾matosis liver. Considering the prevalence of
haemochromatosis of approximately one in 400,
however,' it was inevitable that such a liver
would eventually be transplanted inadvertently.
Current organ donor procurement and preserva￾tion arrangements preclude the routine use of
pretransplant liver biopsy assessments and this
donor was in the precirrhotic stage of his disease.
Since liver function is clinically well preserved
until the fifth or sixth decade in haemochroma￾tosis,2 it is not surprising that the organ func￾tioned well after transplantation.
The pathogenesis of haemochromatosis
remains unknown. Patients with this disorder
have increased intestinal absorption of iron
which accumulates in the liver, pancreas, and
heart causing parenchymal damage over many
years. The factors that control iron absorption
are poorly understood even in the normal
human. A defect in the intestinal regulation
of iron absorption has been postulated as the
primary defect in haemochromatosis," but iron
absorption does respond to body iron stores by
decreasing as these increase.13 A generalised
defect in the reticuloendothelial system has also
been proposed, with the rapid release of iron by
macrophages.6 Since haemochromatosis has
major clinical sequelae in the liver, an intra￾hepatic lesion is another possibility.7 8 Increased
hepatic iron uptake has been found in patients
with haemochromatosis by scanning the liver
after the infusion of radiolabelled transferrin.8
Orthotopic liver transplantation in human
beings has provided the opportunity to study the
effects of liver replacement on many inherited
metabolic diseases. If the metabolic defect of
haemochromatosis had been transplanted into
this patient, hepatic iron would continue to
accumulate as a result of the increased intestinal
iron absorption associated with the disease. The
rapid reduction of hepatic iron after liver trans￾plantation with normal iron absorption in this
patient suggests that the primary metabolic
defect of haemochromatosis does not reside
exclusively in the liver. However, inflammation
in the liver associated with rejection would result
in the release of iron into the circulation, redistri￾bution of iron from the parenchyma to macro￾phages and may contribute to the increased
serum ferritin value. Furthermore, the effects of
liver transplantation on iron absorption and
mobilisation of iron are not clearly understood.
Experimental liver transplantation of iron loaded
livers in rats has shown some reduction in
hepatic iron with rejection but not to the degree
seen in this patient.7 Experimental iron load￾ing of animals has been shown to cause lipid
peroxidation with the production of free radicals
that can cause tissue damage. 14 It is possible that
in this patient hepatic rejection led to the release
of free iron which further exacerbated the
hepatic inflammation. The definitive proof that
this patient will not develop progressive iron
overload will require long term follow up with
assessment of body iron stores by hepatic iron
and serum ferritin determination.
