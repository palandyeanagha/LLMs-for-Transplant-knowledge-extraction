Abstract
We herein present a case of an overlap of immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC)
and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). A 61-year-old man was diagnosed with PBC due to abnormal liver bio￾chemical tests and positivity for serum anti-M2 antibody. However, his response to bezafibrate and ursode￾oxycholic acid was insufficient. Five years later, his serum IgG4 level was found to increase. His liver biopsy
specimens showed features of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis in some portal tracts and periductal fi￾brosis with dense infiltration of IgG4-positive cells in other portal tracts. This case demonstrates that the se￾rum IgG4 level may be worth measuring in patients with PBC refractory to conventional treatment.

Introduction
Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly
recognized fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by a
dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive
plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and elevated serum IgG4
levels (1). IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is
classified as a biliary manifestation of IgG4-RD, and many
cases respond well to corticosteroid treatment (2, 3).
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic
disease with a progressive course characterized by the pres￾ence of serum anti-mitochondrial antibodies and histological
nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis; it is generally treated
with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (4). For PBC patients
showing insufficient response to UDCA, combination ther￾apy of bezafibrate and UDCA is usually effective (5).
IgG4-SC and PBC are two distinct autoimmune liver dis￾eases. However, until now, just two cases of an overlap of
IgG4-SC and PBC have been reported (6, 7), and both also
had autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Among IgG4-SC pa￾tients, 90% have AIP, so the presence of AIP helps the diag￾nosis of IgG4-SC (3). We herein report a case of an overlap
of IgG4-SC and PBC without the concurrence of AIP.
Case Report
A 61-year-old man presented to the hospital for evalu￾ation of abnormal liver biochemical tests with preferential
elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma￾glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) levels: ALP, 2,075 IU/L;
GGT, 1,433 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 86 IU/
L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 105 IU/L; and total
bilirubin, 1.9 mg/dL (Table). Serum levels of IgG and IgM
were 1,976 mg/dL and 945 mg/dL, respectively. Anti-M2
antibody serum level was increased to 79 U/mL. There was
no history of alcohol abuse, blood transfusion, or hepato￾toxic medication. Negative serology excluded viral hepatitis.
Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed no intra￾hepatic mass, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea￾tography (MRCP) did not show common bile duct or he￾patic duct stricture (Fig. 1). He was diagnosed with

PBC (4), and oral UDCA 600 mg daily was introduced.
Seven months later, his liver biochemical tests improved to
some extent but remained abnormal: AST, 56 IU/L; ALT, 54
IU/L; ALP, 1,002 IU/L; GGT, 495 IU/L; and total bilirubin,
0.8 mg/dL. Therefore, oral bezafibrate 400 mg daily was
added (5).
Five years after the introduction of UDCA treatment, his
liver biochemical tests remained abnormal: AST, 74 IU/L;
ALT, 56 IU/L; ALP, 692 IU/L; GGT, 665 IU/L; and total
bilirubin, 2.0 mg/dL. Serum IgM level decreased to 532 mg/
dL although serum IgG level slightly increased to 2,358 mg/
dL. Serum anti-nuclear antibody was positive, with a titer of
1:80. Serum IgG4 level increased to 449 mg/dL. His MRCP
showed bile duct stricture in the hilar hepatic lesions but no
features of AIP (Fig. 2). The serum levels of amylase and li￾pase were within normal limits. Enhanced CT showed no
intra-hepatic mass. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancrea￾tography was not performed because the patient’s informed
consent could not be obtained. In order to diagnose his liver
disease, liver biopsy specimens were taken under ultra￾sonography, based on his informed consent. His liver biopsy
specimens revealed ductular proliferation, interface hepatitis
with marked portal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, and fi￾brosis arranged focally in a storiform pattern, but oblitera￾tive phlebitis features were not observed (Fig. 3A). Features
of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis were noted in
some portal tracts (Fig. 3B), and periductal fibrosis with
lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was observed in other tracts
(Fig. 3C). IgG4 immunostaining revealed more than 30
IgG4-positive cells per high-power field (Fig. 3D). He was
diagnosed with an overlap of IgG4-SC and PBC (4, 8).
Laboratory data at liver biopsy are shown in Table. Using
the revised scoring system proposed by the International
Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (9), the score was 6.
Thereafter, corticosteroid treatment was introduced with

oral prednisolone 30 mg daily, tapered by 5 mg weekly to
10 mg daily. Twenty-four weeks after the introduction of
corticosteroid treatment, his liver biochemical tests did not
normalize. However, serum IgG4 level decreased to 173 mg/
dL, and his MRCP seemed to show some improvement of
bile duct stricture in the hilar hepatic lesions (Fig. 4).
Discussion
Positivity for serum anti-M2 antibody has a high sensitiv￾ity and specificity for the diagnosis of PBC (10). In addi￾tion, the histological features of nonsuppurative destructive
cholangitis in the present case were compatible with
PBC (4). On the other hand, elevated serum IgG4 level and
histological features of periductal fibrosis with dense infil￾tration of IgG4-positive cells met the diagnostic criteria for
IgG4-SC (8). However, the differential diagnosis of IgG4-
SC from primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is difficult in
some cases. Cholangiographic findings are usually useful for
the discrimination of IgG4-SC from PSC. The typical cho￾langiographic findings of IgG4-SC are segmental strictures,
long strictures with pre-stenotic dilation, and strictures of
the lower common bile duct; however, band-like strictures, a
beaded or “pruned-tree” appearance and diverticulum-like
out-pouching are significantly more common in PSC (8).
The MRCP findings of the present case were classified as
Type 2b according to the cholangiographic classification of
IgG4-SC (8). Furthermore, serum IgG4 levels above 540
mg/dL have been reported to have a very high specificity
for the diagnosis of IgG4-SC (>99%) (11). In the present
case, the serum IgG4 level at the time of liver biopsy was
555 mg/dL. Therefore, the present case was diagnosed with

an overlap of IgG4-SC and PBC.
Recently, IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
has been reported to be found in over 3% of classical AIH
cases in a Japanese cohort; it is characterized by high serum
IgG4 and IgE levels and IgG4-bearing plasma cell infiltra￾tion in the liver (12). However, IgG4-associated AIH is di￾agnosed based on the revised scoring system proposed by
the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (9). The pres￾ent case did not meet the criteria for AIH.
The effectiveness of corticosteroid treatment is one of the
clinical characteristics in IgG4-SC (8). However, the present
case showed an incomplete response to corticosteroid ther￾apy. A complete response is only achieved in 60% of IgG4-
SC patients, although 97% show some response (3). In addi￾tion, advanced-stage IgG4-SC has been suggested to be
sometimes unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy because
cases of IgG4-SC show a predominantly inflammatory na￾ture at the early stage, followed by relatively less inflamma￾tion, but marked fibrous scarring later (13). In the present
case, more than 5 years had passed between the first visit
and the introduction of corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, an
insufficient response to corticosteroid therapy does not ne￾gate the diagnosis of IgG4-SC in the present case.
Pancreatic involvement in PBC has been previously re￾ported. Abnormal features of pancreatic ducts by endoscopic
retrograde pancreatography are observed in approximately
10-20% of PBC patients (14, 15). Considering that two
cases of an overlap of IgG4-SC and PBC with concurrent
AIP have been reported (6, 7), some PBC patients may have
AIP. In addition, some PBC patients have been reported to
have idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (16-18), which is one
of the manifestations of IgG4-RD (2). Therefore, a small
subset of PBC patients may have IgG4-RD. However, clini￾cal features of an overlap of IgG4-RD and PBC remain un￾known because of its rarity. All five PBC patients with AIP
or idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis previously reported
were male (6, 7, 16-18). The proportions of women are 87%
and 17-38% in PBC and IgG4-RD, respectively (1, 19), thus
suggesting that gender may be associated with the occur￾rence of IgG4-RD in PBC. Hereafter, a nationwide survey
of an overlap between IgG4-RD and PBC will be needed to
elucidate the clinical features.
Are there common features in PBC and IgG4-RD patho￾geneses? The role of bacteria in PBC development is well
known. There is molecular mimicry between the human E2
component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (target
antigen of anti-M2 antibody) and proteins of Escherichia
coli and serum anti-M2 antibodies in PBC patients bind
to E. coli proteins (20). Furthermore, Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) ligand-stimulated natural killer cells destroy autolo￾gous biliary epithelial cells in the presence of interferon al￾pha synthesized by TLR3 ligand-stimulated monocytes (21).
On the other hand, stimulation with TLR3 and TLR4
ligands enhances IgG4 production by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells in IgG4-RD patients (22). Therefore, an
excessive innate immune response to microbes seems to be
associated with the pathogeneses of PBC and IgG4-RD.
We herein described a case of an overlap of IgG4-SC and
PBC without concomitant AIP. This case demonstrates that
the serum IgG4 level may be worth measuring in patients
with PBC refractory to conventional treatment.
