Abstract
Background: Disease progression of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in patients eligible for liver transplantation
(LTx) occurs in up to 50% of patients, resulting in withdrawal from the LTx waiting list. Transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) is used as bridging therapy with highly variable response rates. The oral multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib significantly increases overall survival and time-to-progression in patients with advanced
hepatocellular cancer.
Design: The HeiLivCa study is a double-blinded, controlled, prospective, randomized multi-centre phase III trial.
Patients in study arm A will be treated with transarterial chemoembolization plus sorafenib 400 mg bid. Patients
in study arm B will be treated with transarterial chemoembolization plus placebo. A total of 208 patients with
histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC diagnosed according to EASL criteria will be enrolled.
An interim patients' analysis will be performed after 60 events. Evaluation of time-to-progression as primary
endpoint (TTP) will be performed at 120 events. Secondary endpoints are number of patients reaching LTx,
disease control rates, OS, progression free survival, quality of live, toxicity and safety.
Discussion: As TACE is the most widely used primary treatment of HCC before LTx and sorafenib is the only
proven effective systemic treatment for advanced HCC there is a strong rational to combine both treatment
modalities. This study is designed to reveal potential superiority of the combined TACE plus sorafenib treatment
over TACE alone and explore a new neo-adjuvant treatment concept in HCC before LTx.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most com￾mon cancer worldwide with more than 1 million deaths
annually [1]. The prevalence of Hepatitis B and C with
consecutive liver cirrhosis and HCC tumor growth leads
to an increasing incidence of HCC especially in Europe
and the USA [2]. HCC develops in a cirrhotic liver in 80%
of cases, with an annual incidence of 2–6% for hepatitis B
virus carriers and 3–5% for hepatitis C virus infected indi￾viduals. Two decades ago, the prognosis of HCC was dev￾astating with most patients dying within the first year after
diagnosis irrespective of their treatment [3]. The develop￾ment of standardized surveillance strategies and the intro￾duction of the Barcelona-clinic liver cancer classification
(BCLC) for clinical management of HCC have signifi￾cantly improved outcome. In industrialized countries 30–
40% of patients are now being diagnosed at initial stages
when curative treatments can be optimally applied. 5-year
overall survival (OS) after resection, liver transplantation
(LTx) or percutaneous treatment in select candidates
reaches 50% to 70% in patients with early HCC (single or
3 nodules ≤3 cm) [1]. Untreated patients at an intermedi￾ate stage (multinodular asymptomatic tumors without an
invasive pattern) achieve a median OS of 16 months.
Locally ablative treatments provide good results (5-year
survival 40–50%) for these patients but cannot achieve
response rates and outcomes comparable to surgical ther￾apy, even when applied as a first line treatment.
LTx is the best treatment option for patients with small
multinodular tumors or those with advanced liver dys￾function. It has the potential to cure the tumor and the
underlying liver disease. Tumor size at the time of LTx as
defined by the Milan criteria (single tumors ≤5 cm or 3
nodules ≤3 cm) has been established as a prognostic fac￾tor [4]. In tertiary referral centers applying these criteria,
survival is ~70% at 5 years, with a recurrence rate of less
than 15% [5]. The shortage of donors still curtails the
potential benefits of LTx. In western countries, tumor pro￾gression occurs in 20–50% of cases on the transplant wait￾ing list.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most
widely usedneo-adjuvant treatment for HCC patients
listed for LTx. Results of randomized controlled trials and
meta-analyses of pooled data for patients with non-resect￾able HCC show a clear survival benefit after TACE com￾pared with conservative management, and is therefore
considered as standard of care in non-resectable HCC [6].
Two studies using TACE for bridging to LTx reported excel￾lent outcomes [7,8]. Nevertheless, only patients with pre￾served liver function and asymptomatic multinodular
tumors without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread
are eligible for TACE to avoid hepatic failure and severe
adverse events [9]. Radiofrequency ablation was not con￾sidered because only few heterogenous uncontrolled stud￾ies suggested a slightly decrease in drop-out rate in
patients treated with RFA before LTx and there is the risk
of needle tract metastases.
Since HCC is generally considered to be chemoresistant,
results of systemic therapy have previously been disap￾pointing. Tumor response rates for single or multiple
agent chemotherapy regimens were low without durable
remission leading to a 1-year survival between 0% to 30%
[10]. Increasing knowledge on the molecular pathogene￾sis of HCC has lead to the development of molecular tar￾geted therapies. The oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib
(Nexavar®) blocks angiogenesis and cell proliferation in
HCC. In patients with advanced HCC, sorafenib has
shown a significant improvement in time-to-progression
(TTP) and OS [11,12]. After the drug has now been
approved by both, FDA and EMEA, it is the new reference
standard treatment of patients with advanced HCC [12].
Evidence-based treatment for HCC relies on fewer than
100 randomized controlled trials and many observational
studies. LTx with previous bridging by TACE is now
accepted as the only treatment capable of definitely curing
HCC but can only be applied to less than 30% of patients.
Low response to TACE and progression on LTx waiting list
are the major prognosis limitating factors. Sorafenib has
direct inhibitory effects on tumor growth and maintains
stable disease in many HCC patients. The combination of
TACE and sorafenib represents a logical, new and encour￾aging approach for neo-adjuvant HCC therapy before LTx.
Design
Subject recruitment
The final protocol has been approved by the local ethics
committee of the Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidel￾berg, Faculty of Medicine (EudraCT-Nr.: 2008-002269-
29). The medical secrecy and the Federal Data Protection
Act will be followed. Written informed consent has to be
obtained. 208 patients (male or female) over 18 years of
age with HCC (single nodule -8 cm or maximum of 3
nodules ≤3 cm) without extrahepatic disease potentially
eligible for LTx will be enrolled in the study. Recruitment
will start in October 2008. Patients are considered for
recruitment to the study according to inclusion and exclu￾sion criteria (Table 1).
Trial coordination
The trial is coordinated by the Department of Surgery at
the Ruprecht-Karls-University, Heidelberg, Germany in
cooperation with the National Centre for Tumor Diseases
(NCT), including overall trial management, trial registra￾tion (International Standard Randomized Controlled
Trial Number (ISRCTN24081794, http://www.control
led-trials.com), database management, quality assurance

BMC Cancer 2008, 8:349 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/349

including monitoring, reporting and the scientific pro￾gram of all trial related meetings.
Data safety monitoring board
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB)
monitors closely the proper conduct of the trial and all
SAE reports to ensure the safety of the subjects during the
course of the study. This committee consists of three inde￾pendent physicians (2 surgeons, one oncologist) as well
as a biometrician and decides on the final diagnostic clas￾sification of critical clinical events. For all serious adverse
events, the documentation and relevant patient data are
verified by the coordinating personnel before submitting
the data to the Adverse Events Committee for diagnostic
classification. Analysis of safety related data is performed
with respect to frequency of:
• Serious adverse events and adverse events stratified by
body-system
• Adverse events stratified by severity
• Adverse events stratified by causality.
Patient toxicities will be assessed using the NCI Common
Toxicity Criteria (CTC-AE V3.0). Toxicity will be evaluated
pretreatment, bi-weekly during the first month, every four
weeks during the following time of treatment and at fol￾low-up. Unacceptable toxicity is defined as unpredictable
or irreversible Grade 4 toxicity. Decisions regarding soraf￾enib treatment and dose-adjustment will be made using
the guidelines of the actual sorafenib prescribing informa￾tion.
Medication supply
The chemotherapeutic agent for TACE is prepared and
provided by the pharmacy of each study center. Sorafenib
and the placebo are prepared and supplied by Bayer
Health Care GmbH and packaged and labeled for the trial
by the pharmacy of the University Hospital Heidelberg.
On site monitoring
The study is performed according to the principles of the
ICH-GCP consolidated guidelines as required by regula￾tory agencies and the ethical principles according to the
current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and local
legal and regulatory requirements [13,14]. The trial is
monitored by KKS Heidelberg according to their standard
operational procedures based on ICH-GCP guidelines.
Study design
The HeiLivCa trial is a prospective, multi-center, placebo￾controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial with
two parallel treatment groups receiving TACE plus soraf￾enib or TACE plus placebo. Patients in both groups will be
treated with a maximum of four TACE procedures. For
TACE carboplatin will be used as chemotherapeutic drug
and lipiodol as embolizing agent. Four weeks after TACE,
response will be evaluated by CT-imaging. Study medica￾tion will be stopped at progression. For patients without

progression, treatment with sorafenib or placebo will be
continued until LTx. All patients will be followed for 24
month after end of treatment. The duration of the overall
trial is expected to last approximately 48 months. The
actual duration of trial may vary due to the availability of
patients meeting the criteria after registration for LTx. (Fig￾ure 1)
Study objectives
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of TACE
plus Sorafenib compared to TACE plus placebo in patients
with HCC before LTx. The primary endpoint is the TTP
based on radiological assessments, defined as the time
from the date of randomization to disease progression. In
the absence of a TTP event, TTP time will be censored at
the date of last disease assessment. The secondary efficacy
objectives are to assess the number or patients reaching
LTx, disease control rates, 1- and 2-year OS after LTx, pro￾gression-free survival, number of TACE in each arm, qual￾ity of life, safety and toxicity.
Randomization and treatment
Patients will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis in a
blinded fashion to the Sorafenib 400 mg or placebo. To
accomplish this, a computer generated randomization
list, which is provided to the Pharmacy at University Hos￾pital Heidelberg, will be prepared by the Patient and Clin￾ical Study Center (PaSZ) at NCT.
When ordering study medication, the investigator will
receive a set of sealed envelopes, via the distributing phar￾macy, one for each randomization number. An identical
set of sealed envelopes will be held in safe and confiden￾tial custody at the NCT. These envelopes contain informa￾tion on the subject's trial medication and are to be opened
only under circumstances in which it is medically imper￾ative to know what the subject is receiving. Date and rea￾son for opening a sealed envelope must be documented.
If possible, the investigator will confer with the safety
officer before unblinding. The randomization envelopes
are not to be opened by the investigator at the end of the
trial. All envelopes will be collected by the site monitor at
the end of the trial.
Investigation schedule and follow-up
Pre-treatment evaluation for all patients includes demo￾graphic data, medical history, physical examination, co￾morbidities, and concomitant medications, complete lab
(CBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, potassium, mag￾nesium, calcium, chloride, BUN, creatinine, ASAT, ALAT,

PT and INR, tumor marker AFP, hepatitis virology, TSH,
fT3 and fT4) and radiological studies to meet the inclu￾sion criteria. During treatment, patients will visit the out￾patient clinics every two weeks during the first month and
every four weeks thereafter. At this visits the aforemen￾tioned laboratory measurements, physical examination,
concomitant medication, vital signs, Karnofsky status and
adverse events will be recorded in the electronic case
report form (eCRF). During each monthly visit, patients
will be provided with the required monthly amount of
study product (or placebo) and are asked to return the
emptied study boxes to survey compliance. Four weeks
after each TACE imaging study, a CT scan of the thorax
and abdomen as well as analysis of tumor marker AFP will
be performed. At end of treatment due to progression or
day of LTx, the aforementioned laboratory measurements,
physical examination, concomitant medication, vital
signs and adverse events will be recorded, imaging studies
and AFP level analysis performed. In the first year after
treatment, patients will be seen every 3 months for clinical
assessment, laboratory analysis and imaging studies. Fol￾low-up data of OS will be evaluated after 12 and 24
months after end of treatment or LTx.
Assessment of quality of life
Measurement of quality of life is one of the secondary
objectives of the trial. OS, return to previous employment,
persistence of symptoms, the ability to perform appropri￾ate activities and to care for oneself are criteria applied in
the three questionnaires used in this study. The EORTC
QLQ-C30 is a general measure of quality of life in cancer
patients. It consist of nine multi-item scales: five func￾tional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and
social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea
and vomiting); and a global health and quality of life scale
[15]. Specific symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, anorexia,
constipation, and diarrhea) are measured as single items.
To assess disease-specific symptoms for patients with
HCC the HCC specific module (QLQ HCC18) will be
used in this study [16]. Patients will complete the quality
of life questionnaires at the baseline visit, four weeks after
each TACE and at the end of study at day of LTX or tumor
progression. Health-related Quality of Life (HQoL) sub￾scales and single item sub-scores will be summarized by
the mean and median for each arm and plotted by time.
HQoL data will be analysed using ANCOVA techniques.
Detailed biometric analysis will be defined in the statisti￾cal analysis plan (SAP) which has to be authorized before
unblinding by the biometrician, the sponsor, and the
leading clinical investigator (LKP).
Sample size calculation
The sample size calculation is based on the detection of
significant differences in TTP, the primary endpoint
parameter of this trial, assuming that median TTP is 4.5
months for the placebo-arm and 7.5 months for the soraf￾enib-arm [11]. A total of 120 TTP events are required for a
log-rank test with an overall one-sided significance level
of 0.05 and power of 0.875. Applying a 1:1 randomiza￾tion, a planned accrual period of 24 months, and a fol￾low-up period of 9 months, it is estimated that 136
patients will be needed. From the experience gained at the
surgery department it can be expected that about 50% of
the patients will drop-out after randomization. These
patients do not contribute any information to the primary
endpoint of this study. In order to accommodate for a
maximum drop-out rate of 50% the total sample size is
therefore increased to 208.
A design with 2 stages (one interim analysis and the final
analysis) has been chosen. The critical values and the test
characteristics of the group sequential test design were cal￾culated for the O'Brien and Fleming stopping rule. The
nominal significance levels for the interim analysis
(planned to be conducted when 60 events have occurred)
and final analysis are 0.0051 and 0.0484 respectively. The
final analysis will take place when approximately 120
events are observed.
Statistical considerations
Full analysis set will include all patients who are rand￾omized, with study medication according to initial rand￾omization, regardless of whether patients receive study
medication or receive a different drug from that to which
they were randomized. This population will be the pri￾mary population for evaluating the efficacy. Safety Popu￾lation: The safety population consists of all patients who
received at least one dose of study medication. This popu￾lation will be the primary population for evaluating treat￾ment administration/compliance and safety. TTP will be
compared between arm A and arm B using the log-rank
test (primary analysis). Median TTP with corresponding
95% confidence intervals (CI) will be estimated using
Kaplan-Meier methods. The hazard ratio (arm B/arm A)
will be estimated by proportional hazard regression. PFS
and OS will be compared between arm A and arm B using
a log-rank test stratified by the variables LTx (yes or no)
and center. Median survival with corresponding 95% CIs
will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The haz￾ard ratio (arm B/arm A) will be estimated by proportional
hazard regression with treatment and the factors used in
the stratified log-rank test in the model. Estimates of the
rates of patients reaching LTx in both arms, disease con￾trol rates, response rates, frequencies of TACE, overall sur￾vival, progression free survival and 95% confidence
interval will be calculated for each treatment group.
Response rates will be compared between treatment
groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting
by the variable LTx (yes or no) and center. The health￾related quality of life and disease/treatment-related symp-

toms scales will be scored according to the EORTC recom￾mendations as described in the EORTC QLQ-C30 and
QLQ-HCC18 scoring manual. Health-related quality of
life subscales and single item subscores will be summa￾rized by the mean and median for each arm and plotted
by time. The change from baseline for all domains will be
examined by treatment arm. All patient data (clinical and
resource use) generated during the study will be recorded
on the eCRFs specifically designed to meet the data
recording requirements of the clinical study protocol. All
data management activities will be done according to
ICH-GCP guidelines. Responsibility for data management
is the NCT. Throughout the study, all patient information
in the eCRF will only be identifiable by means of an iden￾tification number (patient number) and patient initials.
Discussion
Tumor progress while waiting for LTx is common in HCC
patients. Drop-out rates range between 30% to 50% [17].
The role of neo-adjuvant therapies during the time on the
waiting list remains a matter of debate. Currently, TACE is
the standard for bridging patients and has in addition
shown good results for downstaging patients initially not
eligible for LTx [18-20]. This information is based on case
series, case-control studies, and cohort studies showing a
22–29% rate of complete necrosis for TACE [21-25]. Two
studies employing TACE for bridging to LTx reported
excellent outcome [7,8]. Nevertheless, recurrence rates
were only low when applying the Milan criteria [4]. The
impact of recent new treatment approaches; expanding
transplant criteria and the availability of a systemic ther￾apy with sorafenib on drop-out rate, recurrence and OS
have to be assessed in randomized studies.
The HeiLivCa trial is an randomized, controlled, double￾blind, multi-center trial attempting to maximize tumor
growth control in patients with HCC awaiting LTx by add￾ing sorafenib the most effective currently available sys￾temic treatment to brdging with TACE, the current
standard of care. Progression-free survival is the best sur￾rogate endpoint in most solid malignancies, but it is a vul￾nerable endpoint in HCC since the underlying liver
disease is a comorbidity with significant mortality that
would potentially bias the evaluation of efficacy in this
setting. According to the recommendation of a recent con￾sensus conference of the AASLD and the EASLD, TTP is
chosen as a more valid primary end-point. With regard to
the potential side effects and possible cumulative adverse
events in combination with TACE and LTx safety, efficacy
and quality of life will be analyzed as secondary end￾points.
