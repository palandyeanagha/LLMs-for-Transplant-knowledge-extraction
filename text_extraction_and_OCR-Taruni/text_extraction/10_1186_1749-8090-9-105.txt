Abstract
Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare postoperative short-term, mid-term
and long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass surgery performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass
in patients with a low European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of 478 consecutive low risk patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery between
January 2002 and December 2007 was performed. Of these patients, 83 cases had undergone on-pump and 395 cases
had undergone off-pump coronary bypass surgery. The patients were assessed in terms peri-operative complications,
survival, mortality due to cardiac events, need for rehospitalization and repeated coronary revascularization.
Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of preoperative characteristics, except
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The number of distal anastomosis per patient was significantly lower in the
off-pump group than in the on-pump group (2.66 ± 0.74 vs. 3.21 ± 0.85, p < 0.001). Early mortality rates were similar in
both groups (1.01% for the off-pump group and 1.2% for the on-pump group, p = 0.687). Neurological complications
were significantly lower in the off-pump group than in the on-pump group (1.1% vs. 6%, p = 0.01). The mean follow-up
period was 80 ± 19.1 months (range, 3–112 months). The need for revascularization during long-term follow-up
was 10.1% in the off-pump group and 7.2% in the on-pump group (p = 0.416). The 5-year survival was 95.2 ± 1.1%
and 95.5 ± 2.7% in the off-pump and on-pump groups, respectively (p = 0.8), whereas the 7-year survival was 91.9 ± 1.6%
and 84.7 ± 6.8% in the off-pump and on-pump groups, respectively (p = 0.274). The 5-year revascularization-free
period was 89.5 ± 1.6% and 89.7 ± 3.5% in the off-pump and on-pump groups, respectively (p = 0.785). The 7-year
revascularization-free period was 71.1 ± 3.1% and 73.5 ± 7.3% in the off-pump and on-pump groups, respectively
(p = 0.075). The 7-year event-free survival was 80.1 ± 2.2% and 73.4 ± 7.3% in the off-pump and on-pump groups,
respectively (p = 0.377).
Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that off-pump cardiac surgery had advantages over on-pump cardiac
surgery in the short term; however, both interventions had similar mid-term and long-term outcomes, when performed
in low-risk patient.

Background
On-pump coronary bypass surgery is the most frequently
used method in coronary artery surgery, accounting for
80% of surgical revascularization in the United States of
America [1]. On-pump coronary bypass surgery is associ￾ated with higher cardiac, pulmonary, renal, neurological,
and bleeding complications, and therefore off-pump
coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) has gained
increased interest since the mid 1990s, as a strategy to
protect especially high-risk patients from complications
[2-4]. The medical literature contains relatively few reports
comparing on-pump to OPCAB in low risk patients.
Nathoe et al. [5] reported no significant difference between
the two methods regarding cardiac outcomes during a
one-year follow-up.
As European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evalu￾ation (EuroSCORE) as a well-known cardiac surgical risk
scoring systems to predict postoperative mortality in
patient undergoing cardiac surgery, this retrospective
study aimed to compare the postoperative short-, mid- and
long-term outcomes of on-pump and OPCAB coronary
surgery in low-risk patients according to EuroSCORE
evaluation [6].
Methods
Patients
All patients with a EuroSCORE of ≤2 who underwent
elective isolated coronary surgery at the Uludag Univer￾sity Faculty of Medicine hospital between January 2002
and December 2007 were included. This study was ap￾proved by the Uludag Medical Research Ethics committee.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: men aged over 70 and
women aged over 65 years old, previous history of cardiac
surgery, critical preoperative state (need for inotropic drug
support or intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP), acute
renal failure, requiring respiratory support, history of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the preoperative period),
patients with left ventricular ejection fraction under 30%
and cases converted to on-pump during the procedure.
Preoperative, intraoperative and 30-day postoperative
outcomes were retrospectively collected from the hos￾pital records. Postoperative myocardial infarction (MI)
was defined as cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) or creatine
kinase MB isoenzyme (CKMB) values above five times
the normal reference range during the initial 72 hours
following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), when
associated with the appearance of new pathological Q￾waves or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) [7].
Postoperative acute renal failure was defined as an
increase of 100% in serum creatinine. Postoperative
pulmonary complication was defined as pleural effusion,
atelectasis, phrenic nerve paralysis, diaphragmatic dys￾function, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
pneumothorax or chylothorax. Postoperative neurologic
complication was defined as any new focal neurologic
deficit or change in mental status occurring in the post￾operative period.
Long-term follow-up was obtained both from hospital
records and phone calls. Current general health status by
the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification,
mortality (patient death reported by patients’ relatives or
hospital records), late cardiac-related hospitalization (hos￾pital admission for myocardial infarction or heart failure
reported by patient or hospital records), repeated angina
(hospital visit for angina reported by patient or hospital
records), requirements of coronary angiography and repe￾ate revascularization (repeat operation or percutaneous
cardiac intervention (PCI) since the operation reported
by patient or hospital records) were determined.
Surgical technique
As a clinical routine method all patients were premedi￾cated with subcutaneous morphine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg).
Anesthetic induction was performed with fentanyl (5 μg/
kg), midazolam (0.1 mg/kg), and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg).
Maintenance of anesthesia was provided by fentanyl
(0.5-1 μg/kg), vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) and 0.5-1 minimum
alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) of isoflurane.
Classic median sternotomy, left internal thoracic artery
harvesting and other conduits preparation were performed
by a standard technique. Heparin was administered to keep
the activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 300 seconds
during OPCAB and greater than 450 seconds during
on-pump coronary bypass surgery.
Octopus II, III or IV (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN,
US) were used as local myocardium stabilizer. Proximal
coronary clamping of all target vessels was performed by
Mueller atraumatic vascular clamps (0.5 Newton), distal
occlusion was never performed. Filtered room air insuffla￾tions (<5 L/min) was employed to provide better visibility
during anastomosis. All proximal anastomoses were
performed under single side clamping, using 6/0 prolene
sutures. Distal anastomoses were performed by end-to￾side or side-to-side techniques with a running 7/0 prolene
suture. During distal anastomosis and reperfusion, 20%
mannitol (2 mL/kg) was routinely administered. At the
end of surgery heparin was neutralized by protamine
providing that ACT would be 150 to 180 seconds. The
patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and
were connected to a volume-controlled ventilator. In the
early postoperative period (6–8 hours), low molecular￾weight heparin and 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid was
commenced routinely.
In patients undergoing on-pump coronary bypass sur￾gery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established with
an ascending aortic arterial cannula and a right atrial two
stage venous cannula, using a membrane oxygenator and
a roller pump. All patients were cooled to 28-30°C. After

aortic cross-clamping, anterograde cold crystalloid cardio￾plegic solution (15 mL/kg) was initially administered.
Mean arterial blood pressure was maintained in the range
of 60–90 mmHg. Diastolic cardioplegic arrest was main￾tained with cold blood-cardioplegic solution at a ratio of
1:4 at 20 minutes intervals, and warm blood cardioplegia
(hot shot) was given for 5 min before the cross clamp
release. Distal anastomoses were performed by end-to￾side or side-to-side techniques with a running 7/0 prolene
suture. Proximal anastomoses were performed using 6/0
prolene suture during the heating period with the assist￾ance of ascending aortic side-clamp. After the completion
of CPB and cannula removal, heparin was neutralized
with protamine providing an ACT less than 150 seconds.
Acetylsalicylic acid at a dose of 100 mg and low mo￾lecular-weight heparin was initiated on the postoperative
24th hours.
All the patient were discharged under asetilsalisilic
asid therapy. Moreover all of them were under single
antiagregant-drug therapy at the time of phone call.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test nor￾mality of continuous variables. The non-parametric Mann–
Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons.
Categorical variables were compared using Pearson’s
Chi-square and Fisher’s exact chi-square tests. A z-test was
used to compare proportions. Survival analysis, angina-,
MI-, stroke-free period, and revascularization-free period
were compared using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the
Log-Rank test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
The rate of conversion to CPB was 2.5% including 22
patients which were excluded from the study and
eventually data on 478 patients were extracted and
follow-ups were completed. Of these patients, 395
(82.6%) were in the OPCAB group and 83 (17.4%) were in
the on-pump group. Baseline patient characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) prevalence was found significantly higher in
on-pump group than OPCAB group.
The rate of patients with three-vessel disease was sig￾nificantly lower in the OPCAB group (59.7% vs. 77.1%,
p = 0.01); however, two-vessel disease was significantly
higher in OPCAB group (33.4% vs. 20.5%, p = 0.01). More￾over, OPCAB group included significantly more patients
with moderate left ventricular function than on-pump
group (23.3% vs. 15.7%, p = 0.01).
Evaluation of the intraoperative and postoperative out￾comes revealed that duration of surgery and duration of
ventilation period were significantly shorter in the OPCAB
group. However, no differences were observed between
the groups in terms of duration of intensive care unit and
hospital stay and early mortality. The needs for intraoper￾ative inotropic agents and IABP were significantly lower
in the OPCAB group. Moreover, the need for postopera￾tive inotropic agents was lower in the OPCAB group. The
amount of 24 hours drainage and the amount of con￾sumed blood products were significantly lower in the
OPCAB group. However, re-operation due to bleeding
was found significantly more common in the OPCAB
group. Neurological and pulmonary complications were
significantly more common in the on-pump group. No
difference was noted between the groups in terms of the
rates of postoperative MI, mediastinitis and renal compli￾cations (Tables 2 and 3).
The number of distal anastomosis was 2.66 ± 0.74 in
the OPCAB group and 3.21 ± 0.85 in the on-pump
group (p < 0.001). Grafting of the first obtuse margin
(OM1) artery was significantly more frequent in the
on-pump group than in the OPCAB group (68.7% vs.
44.8%%, p < 0.001). However, there were no significant
difference in terms of grafting of the other posterior
surface coronary arteries, including second obtuse mar￾ginal (OM2) artery, right posterior descending (RPD)
artery, and right posterolateral (RPL) artery between
groups. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was
anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery (LAD)
in 97.5% of the patients in the OPCAB group and in
98.8% of the patients in the on-pump group (p = 0.698).
The radial artery was used in 9.9% of the patients in the
OPCAB group and in 9.6% of the patients in the on-pump
group (p = 0.948). However, the right internal mammary
artery (RIMA) was more commonly anastomosed in
the on-pump group (0.3% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001). Coronary
endarterectomy was performed significantly more in
on-pump group than in OPCAB group (3.6% vs. 0.5%,
p < 0.039).
The mean follow-up duration was 82.9 ± 19.1 months
(range, 3–112 months) in the OPCAB group, whereas it
was 67.8 ± 13.3 months (range, 6–85 months) in the on￾pump group (p = 0.0). The 5-year survival rates were
similar in both groups (95.2 ± 1.1% for the OPCAB and
95.5 ± 2.7% for the on-pump group, p = 0.8). The 7-year
survival rates were also similar in both groups (91.9 ±
1.6% for the OPCAB group and 84.7 ± 6.8% for the on￾pump group, p = 0.274).
Percutaneous coronary re-intervention was performed
in 36 (9.1%) patients in the OPCAB group and in 6 (7.2%)
patients in the on-pump group (p = 0.555). Re-operation
for coronary bypass was performed in 4 (1%) patients in
the OPCAB group, but was not performed in the on￾pump group (p = 0.357). The re-intervention-free periods
were similar in both groups. The 5-year re-intervention￾free period was 89.5 ± 1.6% and 89.7 ± 3.5% in the OPCAB
Ercan et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery 2014, 9:105 Page 3 of 8
http://www.cardiothoracicsurgery.org/content/9/1/105

and On-pump groups, respectively (p = 0.785). The 7-year
re-intervention-free period was 71.1 ± 3.1% in the OPCAB
group and 73.5 ± 7.3% in the On-Pump group (p = 0.075).
Evaluation of event-free (angina, MI and stroke) period
during the follow-up period revealed that the 5-year
event-free period was 90.1 ± 1.5% and 87.9 ± 3.87% in the
OPCAB and on-pump groups, respectively, whereas the
7-year event-free period was 80.1 ± 2.2% in the OPCAB
group and 73.4 ± 7.3% in the On-Pump group (p = 0.377).
Evaluation of the long-term general health status of
the patients revealed that 96.2% of the patients in the
OPCAB group and 94% of the patients in the on-pump
group defined their health status better as compared to
their health status in the preoperative period; the groups
showed no difference in this respect (p = 0.424). During
long-term follow-up, 10 (2.5%) patients in the OPCAB
group and 2 (2.4%) patients in the on-pump group died
due to cardiac reasons.
Discussion
Numerous meta-analyses and randomised trials comparing
OPCAB with conventional CABG revealed significantly
decreased blood product transfusion [8-12], inotrope
requirement [8,9,13], stroke incidence [14,15], postop￾erative atrial fibrillation [8,9,13], myocardial injury
[9,10,15,16], ventilation [8,13] and operation time [8,10],
and also İCU (intensive care unit) [13] or hospital stay
[8,13,17] in the OPCAB groups. However, these reports
did not focus on low-risk patients in both short and long
term, as the present study did.
Nathoe et al. [5], in a multicenter randomized trial
performed on low-risk patients reported significantly

shorter operation time in the OPCAB group than the
CPB group. This study also revealed significantly lower
duration of surgery in the OPCAB group than the on￾pump group (208 min vs. 291 min, p < 0.001).
The amount of drainage in the first 24 hours and the
supply of blood products were higher in the on-pump
group, consistent with the literature data, which may be
explained by well-known adverse effects of extracorpor￾eal circulation on coagulation systems. Nevertheless, the
need for re-operation due to bleeding was significantly
higher in the OPCAB group than in the CPB group (8%
vs. 1.2%, p = 0.018), inconsistent with the prior meta￾analysis revealing lower re-operation for bleeding in the
OPCAB group [8,9,15]. Our opposite finding may be ex￾plained by that fact that the excessive bleeding occurring
after OPCAB may not be associated with CPB-related
coagulation problems and should be treated surgically,
unless ACT is too high.
Wijeysundera et al. [9] in their meta-analysis, comparing
OPCAB with on-pump CABG, reported that OPCAB
cause less myocardial damage. Several randomized studies
also revealed significantly lower myocardial enzymes levels
in the OPCAB groups than the CPB groups [10,12,15,16].
İn the present study, the frequency of postoperative
MI was found similar in both groups, but the need for
inotropic agent and IABP counterpulsation due to low
cardiac output was significantly higher in the on-pump
group. After all, the OPCAB group included significantly
more patients with moderate left ventricular function than
on-pump group. These findings indicate that the OPCAB
technique caused less myocardial damage when compared
with the CPB technique, even in low risk CABG patients.
No significant difference was found between the OPCAB
and CPB groups in terms of postoperative AF frequency
(9.9% vs. 8.4%, p = 0.174). These finding supports recent
report conducted by Nature et al. in low risk CABG
patients [5]. However, since continuous monitoring for AF
was not performed in the present study, short-lasting AF
attacks might have been overlooked.
Neurological complications are generally considered as
the most important coronary surgery related morbidity
because of their contribution to mortality, effects on
patient’s quality of life and socio-economic outcomes
[18,19]. Moreover, mortality rate has been reported
10%-21% in patients developed major neurologic deficit
[18,20,21]. Studies have led to the thought that CPB

and related factors are the most important sources of
neurological complications [22,23]. In their meta-analysis,
Edelman et al. [14] reported stroke rates to be 0.38% in
the OPCAB group, in which aortic manipulation was not
performed, and significantly lower than the conventional
group (1.87%). Consistently, the present study detected
significantly more neurological complications in the
on-pump group than the OPCAB group (1,1% vs. 6%,
p = 0.01). These findings revealed that even in low-risk
patients CPB causes more neurological complications
than OPCAB.
Cheng’s [8] meta-analysis revealed significantly shorter
ventilatory support and lesser pulmonary infections in
the OPCAB group as compared to the conventional
CABG group. İn the present study pulmonary complica￾tions were observed in 12 (3.1%) patients in the OPCAB
group and in 7 (8.4%) patients in the on-pump group
(p = 0.031). However, this finding might be affected by
significantly more frequency of COPD in the on pump
group than the OPCAB group (Table 1).
A mild impairment may be observed in the renal func￾tions in the majority of patients undergoing conventional
coronary surgery and this may progress to renal failure
requiring dialysis in 1%-5% of the patients, being more
frequent in those previously having partially impaired
renal function and heart failure [24-26]. The meta-analysis
reported by Wijeysundera [9] and Reston [15] demon￾strated that impaired renal functions are less observed in
the OPCAB procedure as compared to the conventional
method. However, Cheng [8] found no significant differ￾ence for renal dysfunction, in a meta-analysis comparing
OPCAB with conventional CABG. In the present study
focusing on low risk patients only one (0.3%) OPCAB
patient developed acute renal failure while none of CPB
patients did so (p = 0.646).
Graft patency is considered one of the important mea￾sures in evaluating the coronary surgery procedures. In
recent randomized studies, Puskas et al. [17] and Angelini
et al. [27] reported similar graft patency in the conven￾tional and OPCAB groups; however, Khan et al. [12]
reported lower patency in the OPCAB group. A meta￾analysis of prospective randomized trials comparing off￾pump with on-pump coronary graft patency revealed an
increased risk of graft occlusion in the OPCAB group [28].
The present study revealed similar late re-intervention rate
in the OPCAB and CPB groups (10.1% vs. 7.2%, p = 0,416),
in long-term (Table 4).
A meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials reported by
Cheng et al. [8] found significantly lower distal anasto￾mosis number in the OPCAB groups than in the CPB
groups. İn the present study, the number of grafts and the
number of distal anastomoses per patient were detected
significantly lower in the OPCAB group (Table 2). However,
these findings may be correlated with the lower number of
diseased vessels in OPCAB group, as mentioned before
(Table 1). Moreover, long-term follow-up did not revealed
difference between two techniques, in term of cardiac
re-interventions and cardiac mortality (Table 4).
Takagi et al. [29] reported that OPCAB increases late
all-cause mortality as compared to conventional group,
due to lower revascularization rate and graft patency in
OPCAB patients. The present study showed that the
5- and 7-year survival rates were similar in the
OPCAB and in the on-pump groups and no difference
was observed between the groups in the long-term
regarding the event-free period such as need for re-surgery,
angina, MI and stroke. The late all-cause mortality rate
between groups was similar (7.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.080).
Conclusion
The results of this study conducted in low risk patients
support OPCAB’s favorable effects on blood product
need, duration of surgery, neurological complications rate,
length of intensive care unit stay, postoperative inotropic
agent need, frequency of pulmonary complications and
duration of ventilation, during the short-term. Moreover,
mid- and long-term outcomes revealed that cardiac￾related mortality, need for re-intervention and angina￾free period were similar to on-pump technique. Despite
the advantages of the OPCAB in the short-term, this

method was found not be superior to the on-pump
method in the mid- and long-terms, in low risk patients.
Better short-term data and similar long-term outcomes
appears to support reliability and efficacy of the OPCAB
method in low risk patient.
The present study has some limitations including its
retrospective design, single-center site and relatively small
sample size. Therefore, its result should be cautiously
interpreted. Larger prospective randomized, multicenter
trials may help define the optimal management of low risk
CABG patients.
