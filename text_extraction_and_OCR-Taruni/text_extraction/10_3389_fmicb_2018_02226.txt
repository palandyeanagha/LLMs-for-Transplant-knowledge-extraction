Recently, mechanism study of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has attracted an
increasing attention because of the growing rate of the acute hepatitis caused by the
virus over the world. As an important initiate in the inflammation, mast cells (MCs) play a
critical role in maintaining a healthy physiology. However, the function of the MCs in the
acute hepatitis caused by HEV is still unclear. In the present study, mongolian gerbils
infected by HEV were used as an animal model to evaluate the role of MCs in the HEV
infection. The positive ELISA and RT-PCR results showed the gerbils was successfully
infected with HEV. The number of mast cell in the liver and the small intestine in the
infected animals were growing higher significantly than the control group. In addition,
higher expression of the tryptase and 5-HT in the liver and the intestine detected by
immunohistochemical method and western blot also indicate the activation of MCs in
the infection. These results suggest that MCs play an important role in the hepatitis E.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs
to the family Hepeviridae (Smith et al., 2014), which is one of the main causes of acute hepatitis
in humans and many other species (Martin-Latil et al., 2016; Donnelly et al., 2017). Although,
hepatitis E is largely a self-limiting disease (Rathod and Tripathy, 2014, 2016), pregnant women
and fetals are exceptionally susceptible to HEV infection (Nan et al., 2017; Verma et al., 2017). The
mortality rate of pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy infected with HEV is as high
as 25%, extremely easy to death of the mother and fetus, abortion, premature delivery or stillbirth
(Mancinelli et al., 2017; Naru et al., 2017). The reasons for hepatitis E-related high maternal and
fetal mortalities are unclear (Ahn et al., 2017). In last dozen years, extraepatic lesions caused by
HEV have received increasing attention due to their association with neurological symptoms, acute
pancreatitis, severe thrombocytopenia, myositis, and kidney diseases (Lee et al., 2009; Nan and
Zhang, 2016). Unfortunately, the mechanism of HEV infection and transmission is still unclear.
The most current studies focus on the HEV and antivirus immune signaling pathway including
RIG-1, MAPK, NF-κB, and PI3K (Zafrullah et al., 1997; Korkaya et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2014; He
et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017). More studies are required to fully understand the
mechanism of HEV infection.
Mast cells (MCs) not only play important role in allergic responses but also are employed as a
initiator and regulator cells in both innate and adaptive immune responses (da Silva et al., 2014).

Liu et al. Mast Cells Activation in Hepatitis E
It is well known the widely distribution of MCs in the
body, especially, at the skin and airways recognized as host
environmental interfaces, where they can be found around nerves
and blood vessels (Wang et al., 2012; Ronsard et al., 2017b).
Therefore, they can releasing many active mediators such as
cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators for the purpose
of acting as important sentinels for the immune system and
control effective innate responses against invading pathogens
(Ronsard et al., 2014; Wouters et al., 2016). Unlike the recognized
contributions of MCs to host defense against bacteria, the
function of MCs in antiviral immunity has not been well
understand (Zizzi et al., 2011; Graham et al., 2013; Swindle et al.,
2015; Ronsard et al., 2017a). In recent researches, several viruses,
including dengue virus and infectious bursal disease virus, have
been suspected can activate MCs in vitro through TLR3, TLR7,
and possibly other mechanisms (Wang et al., 2008, 2009; Chu
et al., 2015, 2017). However, the in vivo contribution of MCs to
host defense in viral infections is need more investigation.
In recent, researches of viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, liver
fibrosis and other bile duct disease have shown that mast cell
usually increases as the disease development, suggest MCs play
important role in the liver disorders (Heine et al., 1978; O’Keeffe
et al., 2002; Franceschini et al., 2007). In systemic mast cell
activation syndrome patients associated with elevated cholesterol
levels also showed high transaminase and bilirubin levels. This
finding suggested that mast cell activation involving in the
abnormal of the liver function (Bardadin and Scheuer, 1986;
Doria et al., 2006). MCs has been considered as one indicators
of the acute hepatitis. However, special roles of MCs play in the
liver disease remain unknown. Moreover, very few information
were reported on the activity of MCs in the hepatitis E.
In the present study, we examined the MCs activation
in Mongolian gerbil model of HEV. Mongolian gerbil was
successfully infected by genotype 4 strain of HEV via the
intraperitoneal route. Using toluidine blue staining and
immunohistochemical staining method, the distribution and
release of mediators such as the tryptase and 5-HT of MCs in
the liver and the intestine were investigated. Histopathological
changes of major organs like liver, kidney, spleen, and brain also
were examined in the study.
RESULTS
Clinical Evaluation and Detection of HEV
For body temperature detection, the temperature of experiment
group was observed to rise from 5 to 11 dpi, up to the 39.7◦C,
obviously higher than that of control group (Figure 1). The
clinical manifestations in patients infected with HEV include
fever, malaise, nausea, vomition, anorexia, abdominal distension,
and diarrhea, at the same time, liver slightly enlargement,
tenderness and percussion pain, urine color deepened. In general,
those symptoms will last for several days, an average of 10 day.
But for animals infected with HEV, it is not clear that whether
fever would be observed. In the study, the body temperature
of Mongolian gerbils inoculated with HEV was recorded daily,
and the results showed that the gerbils had a fever in the early
FIGURE 1 | Schematic diagram body temperature of Gerbils inoculated with
HEV recovering pig liver and negative pig liver. In the inoculated group, body
temperature rose at 5–11 dpi. The normal body temperature of gerbils is
between 38.1 and 38.4◦C (∗Denotes statistical significance for the
comparison of control, ∗p < 0.05).
infection stage, but lasted only for a week. The most obvious
increase is on the 9–10 dpi (the increase of about 1.5◦C). This
result indicate that animals infected with HEV can also present
clinical symptoms such as fever, but due to the short duration and
spontaneous recovery, it is often overlooked.
Table 1 shows the results of positive tissue number for
HEV RNA RT-PCR detection at different time points. After
inoculation, all liver tissues (5/5) of the gerbils in experimental
group at 14, 28, and 56 dpi were positive for RT-PCR detection. At
14 and 21 dpi, positive samples of the small intestine were 3/5 and
5/5. In the feces, 11/15 and 10/10 positive sample were detected

at 14 and 28 dpi. The liver, serum, and feces of the control group
gave negative results though the whole experiment (Table 1). The
ELISA assay results are listed in Table 2. At 14, 28, and 56 dpi,
2/15, 6/10, and 3/5 positive serum of anti-HEV IgG were detected
by ELISA, but no positive was observed in the control group
during the experiment.
In order to observe the distribution and expression of
HEV ORF2 in major organs, immunohistochemical staining
was performed. Positive signals for HEV-ORF2 proteins were
represented by a brown or yellow granular mass. There were
strong positive signals for ORF2 were observed in the major
tissues of the experimental group (Figure 2). On the contrary, no
positive signals for the HEV ORF2 antigens were detected in the
major tissues in the control group (Supplementary Figure S1).
Immunohistochemistry showed that HEV ORF2 positive signals
were detected in the liver hepatocyte around the portal area
(Figure 2A), the epithelial cell of the small intestine (Figure 2B),
seminiferous epithelium cell of the testis (Figure 2C), nerve cell
of the brain (Figure 2D), myocardial cell of the heart (Figure 2E),
and the renal tubular epithelial cell of the kidney (Figure 2F). The
mainly type of positive feature was cytoplasmic diffusive, and the
positive signals in later stage infection were more than in the early
stage.
Activation Detection of Mast Cell
As shown in Figure 3, MCs in the liver and the small intestine
were detected by toluidine blue staining and appeared in dark
purple. For experiment group, MCs mainly concentrate in
periportal vessels of the liver (Figures 3A,B) or in the muscle
layer and lamina propria of small intestine (Figures 3C,D).
Compared with the control group, number of MCs in the liver
and the small intestine both increase significantly in the early
infection stage and got the maximum on 7 dpi then phased down
(Figures 3E,F).
Immunohistochemistry staining images of the tryptase and
5-hydroxytryptamine in the liver were showed in Figure 4.
No positive signals for tryptase and 5-hydroxytryptamine were
detected in the liver in the control group (Figures 4A,C).
Positive signals for tryptase appeared in yellow were observed
in the cytoplasm of hepatocyte around the portal area
(Figure 4B). Positive signals for 5-hydroxytryptamine appeared
in brown were observed in the cytoplasm and cell nucleus
of hepatocyte (Figure 4D). In the early infection stage,
the positive density of tryptase and 5-hydroxytryptamine
of experiment group was significantly higher than that of
the control group (Figures 4E,F). The protein expression
levels of tryptase and 5-hydroxytryptamine were detected by
western blotting. Figure 5 shows the expression of tryptase
and 5-hydroxytryptamine were significant higher in HEV
RNA-positive liver tissues than in the control group. These

results suggested the increased MCs activation and MCs play
an important role in the inflammation happen in the liver and
intestine.
Histopathological Observation
Inoculated gerbils show pathological signs of HEV infection
from the 14 DPI compared with the control group. In the
liver, there are sinus congestion and central venous congestion,
degeneration of hepatocyte granules (Figure 6A), bile duct
epithelial hyperplasia, hepatocyte necrosis, and lymphocytic
infiltrations were observed in Kiernan’s space (Figure 6B),
there is also proliferation of fibrous connective tissue in
portal tracts (Supplementary Figure S2) and hepatic sinusoidal
reticular fiber turn into collagen in liver. Focal hemorrhage
(Figure 6C), meningeal blood vessels dilation, glial nodule
formation (Figure 6D). In the kidney, there are renal tubular
epithelial cell degeneration and interstitial vascular congestion
(Figure 7A). There is some mild bleeding in the white pulp
of spleen (Figure 7B). The epithelial of spermatogenic cells
arrange loosely and the fixed nucleus (Figure 7C) and myocardial
fiber focal necrosis in the heart (Figure 7D) were observed.
Meanwhile, the damage in later stage infection was more serious
than in the early stage.
DISCUSSION
Because of the shortage of practical animal model and
effective cell culture system limited the research of HEV

(Huang et al., 2004), there is big challenge for effective HEV
vaccine available (Dalton et al., 2008). The non-human primates
and swine have been used as infection models effectively, but
the cost limit the application of these animal models (Lee et al.,
2009). Previously, we reported Mongolian gerbil can be used
as an animal model for HEV, because of that Mongolian gerbil
is sensitive to HEV and lower rates of spontaneous hepatitis
(Soomro et al., 2016, 2017). In the present study, Mongolian
gerbil hepatitis E infection model was successfully obtained
according to the intraperitoneal route.
Mast cell can constantly monitor bacterial invasion as
“sentinels,” and give rise to the immune response against
pathogens (Schmerse et al., 2014). Mast cell can release different
mediators and cytokines for different stimuli, as a result,
it plays an important role in the initiation and prognosis
of inflammatory response. MCs are recognized as a critical
moderator in maintaining a healthy physiology and participating
in innate and adaptive immunity. Mast cells are also involved in
the inflammatory process, recruiting different white blood cells
in injured sites and allergic diseases (Weller et al., 2011). Several
studies have shown that MCs are associated with antiviral defense
mechanisms and pathogenesis of viral diseases. In most cases,
MCs are beneficial to the host’s defense response, but in some
cases, it can also be damaging to the host. For example, MCs could
promote lung injury caused by H5N1 influenza virus infection
by releasing pro-inflammatory agents (Hu et al., 2012). MCs are
also involved in host defense at herpes simplex virus-infected

of MCs and stimulated release of mediators such as tryptase
and 5-hydroxytryptamine in liver and intestine were examined
by different methods. Increased number of MCs and higher
expression of tryptase and 5-hydroxytryptamine indicate that
activation of MCs maybe involving in the HEV pathogenesis.
Tryptase is a neutral serine protease and is the most
abundant mediator stored in mast cell granules. The release
of tryptase from the secretory granules is a characteristic
feature of mast cell degranulation. Mast cell tryptase has an
important role in inflammation and serves as a marker of
mast cell activation (Payne and Kam, 2004; Wang et al.,
2016). The tryptase initiated signaling cascade supporting the
tissue repair and sometimes fibrosis proliferative response has
been elucidated in fibroblasts (Frungieri et al., 2005; Duchesne
et al., 2011). 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) is a monoamine
neurotransmitter synthesized in serotonergic neurons in the
central nervous system (CNS) and enterochromaffin cells in the
gastrointestinal tract of animals including humans (Gruba et al.,
2014). 5-HT is present in murine mucosal MCs and some authors
reported that human MCs may also contain serotonin (Kritas
et al., 2014). In our study, tryptase and 5-HT were used to evaluate
the activation of MCs. The higher expression of these two indexes
indicated that MCs cells activation during the HEV infection.
The main pathological damage in liver tissues of patients
infected with HEV is portal inflammation, there are a large
number of lymphocytes and kupffer cells infiltration (Wu et al.,
2017). Usually, accompanied with cholangiole cholestasis, liver
cell degeneration. For acute severe cases, liver cell diffuse
necrosis, a mass of infiltration of lymphocytes, especially in portal
tracts. For subacute severe cases, the structure of hepatic lobule
is not clear, there are multiple focal necrosis among the normal
tissues. In the study, we observed the histopathological lesion
of all tissues of Mongolian gerbils infected with HEV. And the
application of Mallory trichrome staining suggested that the liver
fibrosis appeared in the later stage of infection.
CONCLUSION
The present study demonstrated that Mongolian gerbils as an
ideal animal model of HEV infection could be used in the
mechanism study. In addition, the study provides a new idea for
the further study of HEV pathogenesis, which enhanced MCs
number and release of proteases and 5-HT to increased local
vascular permeability and recruitment of other participants in
the mongolian gerbils infected by HEV. Activation of mast cell
may play an important role in the HEV infection, but the specific
mechanism need further study as well. Moreover, it is urgent need
to establish “MC knock-in animal” to evaluate the contribution of
MCs in HEV infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inoculum
SwHB-3 (HEV 4) recovered from a swine liver sample collected
from Hebei province, China, used in the experiment. The part of
the sequence of swHB-3 has been determined and deposited in
Gene Bank (GU553094). In details, liver homogenates (10%, w/v,
suspension) were filtered (0.22 mm filter unit, Carrigtwohill, Co.,
Cork, Ireland) and the PID50 (50% swine infectious doses per
ml of inoculum) was determined as previously described (Meng
et al., 1998).

Liu et al. Mast Cells Activation in Hepatitis E
Animals and Treatment
Forty male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) of clean
grade were purchased from the Department of Experimental
Animal Sciences of Capital Medical University (Beijing, China).
All animals used in the experiment were confirmed negative for
HEV antibodies examination by an ELISA assay. All treatments
were performed following an acclimation period of 7 days
after their arrival at the laboratory to avoid stress. Animals
were randomly divided into two groups (the experimental
group and control group). Each gerbil in the experimental
group was inoculated via the intraperitoneal route with a
0.1 ml inoculum that had an infectious titer of 104.5 PID50.
Animal in the control group was inoculated with the equal
volume of RT-PCR negative liver homogenates as negative
controls. Temperature was measured daily during 14 days
post injection (dpi). This study was carried out in accordance
with the recommendations the Regulations of Experimental
Animals of Beijing Authority. The protocol was approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of the China Agriculture
University.
Specimen Collection
Fecal samples and serum samples were collected weekly, then
the samples were stored at −80◦C. Body temperature of
gerbils were measured daily. Five gerbils from each group
were necropsied at 7, 14, 28, and 56 dpi, the heart, liver,
spleen, lung, kidney, stomach, testis, small intestine, adrenal
gland, and brain were collected at an immediate necropsy.
Fresh frozen tissue samples were stored at −80◦C for HEV
RNA detection. Additional samples were fixed immediately
in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde-polyoxymethylene solution for
72 h for histological studies and immunohistochemical staining.
All samples stored at −80◦C. Effective measures have been
performed to avoid HEV cross contamination during necropsy
sampling as previously described (de Deus et al., 2008).
RT-PCR to Detect HEV RNA in Inoculated
Gerbils
Viral RNA was extracted from the inoculated gerbils samples such
as serum, feces, liver, spleen, kidney, and small intestine. The
detailed procedure of RT-PCR is listed in the Supplementary
Materials. Then nested RT-PCR was performed using two sets
of ORF2-specific primers designed for detecting genetically
divergent strains of HEV: HE164F1 (50
-GCR GTG GTT TCT
GGG GTG AC-30
) and HE164R1 (50
-CTG GGM YTG GTC DCG
CCA AG-30
) were used as out primers, and HE137F2 (50
-GYT
GAT TCT CAG CCC TTC GC-30
) and HE137R2 (50
-GMY
TGG TCD CGC CAA GHG GA-30
) used as internal primers
(Tam et al., 1991). Detailed information of transcription system
for RNA and amplifying system for HEV RNA RT-PCR are
listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2. Amplification conditions
for both round of PCR were: 94◦C for 3 min; 30 cycles of
94◦C for 30 s, 58◦C for 35 s, and 72◦C for 30 s; 72◦C
for 7 min (Yang et al., 2018). Negative (pure water) and
positive (HEV RNA) controls were designed in the RT-PCR
assay.
Histopathological Examination
The fixed tissues were dehydrated using increasing
concentrations of ethanol and embedded in paraffin according
to standard laboratory procedures, and 4 µm sections were
prepared then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for
histological evaluation (Yang et al., 2015). The unstained sections
were used for immunohistochemistry, Mallory’s trichrome,
and toluidine blue staining for antigen detection, tryptase and
5-hydroxytryptamine, fibrosis and MCs observations in tissues.
The positive MCs stained by toluidine blue were observed as
purplish red granular mass (Joseph et al., 2018). Multiple views
(five per section of each organ) were used to count the number
of positive cells per view. The average of each groups were
calculated. All tissue sections were examined with an Olympus
BH-2 microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections were prepared as previously described in this
section, were deparaffinating, hydrated, water-bath heated for
antigen retrieval and blocked with the addition of 3% hydrogen
peroxide for immunohistochemistry. Afterward sections were
incubated overnight with primary antibody monoclonal mouse
anti-HEV ORF2, tryptase and 5-hydroxytryptamine antibody
(1:200 dilution; Beijing Protein Institute, Beijing, China).
Immunohistochemical staining was performed following
the instructions that were included in the HistostainTM￾Plus kit (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China). 3,30
-Diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB; ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) was
applied for 5 min to visualize the antigen–antibody compound,
Gill’s hematoxylin was applied as the background stain (Yang
et al., 2018). The slides were observed under light microscope
(Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and positive signals
for HEV-ORF2 proteins were represented by a brown or yellow
granular mass (Soomro et al., 2016). The positive staining
intensity of ORF2, tryptase, and 5-hydroxytryptamine were
measured as the ratio of the stained area to the total field
assessed. Multiple views (three fields per section and five sections
per animal) were randomly selected and analyzed.
ELISA for HEV Antibody and Antigen
Detection
Serum samples were tested for the presence of IgG anti-HEV,
using a commercial ELISA kit (Wan-tai Biological Pharmacy
Co., Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The absorbance was determined at 450 nm (Multiscan Titer tek
MCC). According to the instruction of Beijing Wantai Biological
Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Beijing, China, cut off value is the half
of the total of positive control OD value plus negative control OD
value. Positive is identified if the test OD < cut off OD.
Western Blotting Analysis
The protein expression levels of tryptase and 5-
hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 were detected by western
blot analysis. The tryptase antibody was obtained from Beyotime
Biotechnolgoy Co., Ltd. (China). The 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptor 3 antibodies were obtained from Biosynthesis
