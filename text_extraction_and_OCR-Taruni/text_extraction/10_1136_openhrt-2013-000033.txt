ABSTRACT
Average life expectancy is increasing in the western
world resulting in a growing number of frail individuals
with coronary heart disease, often associated with
comorbidities. Decisions to proceed to invasive
interventions in elderly frail patients is challenging
because they may gain benefit, but are also at risk of
procedure-related complications. Current risk scores
designed to predict mortality in cardiac procedures are
mainly based on clinical and angiographic factors, with
limitations in the elderly because they are mainly
derived from a middle-aged population, do not account
for frailty and do not predict the impact of the
procedure on quality of life which often matters more
to elderly patients than mortality. Frailty assessment
has emerged as a measure of biological age that
correlates well with quality of life, hospital admissions
and mortality. Potentially, the incorporation of frailty
into current risk assessment models will cause a shift
towards more appropriate care. The need for a more
accurate method of risk stratification incorporating
frailty, particularly for elderly patients is pressing. This
article reviews the association between frailty and
cardiovascular disease, the impact of frailty on
outcomes of cardiac interventions and suggests ways
in which frailty assessment could be incorporated into
cardiology clinical practice.
INTRODUCTION
Increasing life expectancy is resulting in a
corresponding rise in the average age of
patients presenting with cardiovascular dis￾eases (CVDs). Ageing is characterised by a
reduction in functional reserve. Frailty is an
increased vulnerability to minor stressors that
develops because of age-related decline.
With frailty, this decline is accelerated and
homoeostatic mechanisms start to fail.1
Apoptosis, senescence, repair, inflammation
and immune activation have all been impli￾cated as pathways responsible for this decline
(figure 1).
‘Biological age’ is often taken as a crude
index of frailty, while chronological age is a
poor correlate. Indeed up to 75% of patients
over the age of 85 years are not frail.2 Frailty
assessment correlates well with quality of life
(QoL), hospital admissions and mortality.3–5
The importance of frailty has been acknowl￾edged by the American Heart Association
(AHA) which has called for a better under￾standing of frailty in cardiac care.6 They have
suggested that trials should include improved
characterisation of the elderly population
and the evaluation of the influence of frailty
and cognitive decline on outcomes.
The need to include frailty assessment in
decision-making is pressing. Treating an
elderly patient often involves high-risk, high￾gain treatments.7 Incorporation of frailty in
risk stratification may help distinguish older
patients who may benefit from intervention
from those who will gain little benefit or may
even be harmed by aggressive intervention.7
This article reviews the association between
frailty and CVD, the impact of frailty on out￾comes of cardiac interventions, how to
incorporate frailty assessment in clinical prac￾tice and proposes future directions in this
field.
ASSESSMENT OF FRAILTY
There is no consensus as to how frailty
should be assessed. A report from six major
international, European and US societies in
geriatric medicine recommends that all
patients >70 years should be screened for
frailty.8 Yet, they give no recommendation on
how to identify frailty.
Subjective ‘end-of-the-bed’ test
Traditionally, assessment of frailty was based
purely on clinical judgement. This
‘end-of-the-bed test’ still plays a key role and
is an attempt to assess the patient’s frailty
based on simple visual appearance. However,
frailty may not be visually obvious and ‘appar￾ent frailty’ can vary between encounters,
depending on the specific environment
(hospital, community, clinic), the time of
day, recent sleep disturbance, nutritional
status and mood. A subjective approach to

assessment therefore has limitations and potential bias.
A simple, objective, universal and readily available test or
score would be useful.
Frailty scores
A number of frailty scores have been designed by geria￾tricians comprising a combination of functional tests,
laboratory tests, questionnaires, descriptive scales, dis￾ability assessments and comorbidity assessments. High
scores in these are associated with adverse outcomes in
elderly patient populations and may aid clinical manage￾ment. The most commonly used scores are summarised
in table 1. Comprehensive geriatric assessment takes
into consideration the multiple interacting medical and
social needs of patients, how illness impacts on function
and how each of these affect healthcare outcomes.9
Comprehensive Assessment of Frailty (CAF) is a tool to
assess prognosis in elderly cardiac surgery patients.10
However, it is complex and takes 10–20 min to perform.
The practicality of incorporating it into routine pre￾operative cardiac assessment would be challenging. A
study has compared frailty scores with disability scores
and cardiac risk scoring systems. The frailty scores
assessed were the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)
scale, the expanded CHS scale, the MacArthur Study of
Successful Ageing (MSSA) scale and gait speed alone.
They applied these to 152 patients, aged >70 years
undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/
or valve surgery.11 Frailty prevalence ranged from 20%
to 46%, depending on the frailty score. The addition of
frailty and disability to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons
(STS) score improved model discrimination. The most
predictive frailty score was 5 m gait speed.11 Another
study using gait speed to measure frailty demonstrated
an increased risk of cardiovascular events after
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients
with slow gait.12 Gait speed was measured prior to dis￾charge. Although this is useful to allow prediction of
future events, it is not helpful at presentation.
Therefore, for frailty to be incorporated into preproce￾dural risk assessment, a different form of assessment is
required. We and others have found that Canadian
Study of Health and Ageing score (figure 2) is an easy
and reliable tool to assess frailty.13–15

Challenges in frailty assessment
The utilisation of frailty assessment in healthcare is not
without its potential limitations. There is a subjective
element in the majority of frailty scores, allowing for
some potential incongruity. Yet this is still less subjective
than a poorly documented (or not performed)
‘end-of-the-bed’ test. This subjectivity could predispose
clinicians calculating a risk score to shape a desired
figure. With the publication of outcomes across surgical
specialties and interventional cardiology, this is even
more relevant. The use of an objective measure of frailty
would prevent this. Additionally, frailty is a dynamic risk
factor and could vary significantly between clinic
encounters. However, health status is also dynamic and
this could just shadow this. Further research on the sta￾bility of frailty measurement as a risk factor is required.
IMPACT OF FRAILTY ON HEALTH AND CLINICAL
OUTCOMES
Frailty has been explored in a number of disease-specific
cohorts. For example, frailty independently predicts
mortality in patients undergoing haemodialysis and
following community-acquired pneumonia.16 The
European Male Ageing Study Group identified frailty as
a predictor of all-cause mortality.17 Similarly, frailty is
associated with increased mortality in patients attending
acute medical units and in those being admitted from
emergency departments.13 18 Frailty has also been asso￾ciated with surgical outcomes, including postoperative
mortality and rehospitalisation.19
Frailty and CVD
Frailty is a predictor of mortality in patients with CVD
independent of age, underlying disease severity,
comorbidities and disability (table 2).20 21 The link
between frailty and CVD was first noted in a secondary
analysis of a study of community dwelling elders. Of the
frail patients, 62% had coexisting CVD compared with
28% of the ‘non-frail’.
22 The CHS disclosed a threefold
increase in the presence of frailty in patients with CVD,
a relationship extending to subclinical CVD including
increased left ventricular (LV) mass and ECG abnormal￾ities.23 In another study of 2515 individuals, an increase
in the frailty score by one point of five was associated
with a 35% increase in the risk of having CVD and a

20% increase in the risk of having hypertension.24 In
the Women’s Health Initiative observational study the
presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke,
hypertension or diabetes in non-frail patients was pre￾dictive of frailty developing during 3 years of follow-up.
The development of frailty was, in turn, predictive of all￾cause mortality.25 Frailty is a risk factor for the develop￾ment and progression of CVD, while CVD can lead to
frailty. It is, therefore, conceivable that treating one
might improve the other. ACE inhibitors, a standard
treatment to improve morbidity and mortality in heart
failure, also improve functional status and exercise cap￾acity in elderly patients with no history of heart failure
or LV systolic dysfunction.26
Frailty, heart failure and atrial fibrillation
Heart failure in the elderly is a major public health
problem and the prevalence is rising. The prognosis
remains poor. Frailty has been identified as a major pre￾dictor of mortality in elderly patients with heart failure.
One study examined the effect of frailty on healthcare
utilisation in patients with heart failure. Frailty was
associated with a 92% increased risk of hospital attend￾ance and a 65% increased risk of admission.27 A rela￾tionship between frailty and atrial fibrillation (AF) has
also recently been described. Polidoro et al28 assessed
patients with AF for frailty and compared them to age￾matched and sex-matched controls. AF was strongly asso￾ciated with high frailty score.28 AF might, therefore, be a
surrogate for frailty. Indeed, it is well described that AF
is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and
mortality after the adjustment for pre-existing cardiovas￾cular conditions with which AF is associated.29 The
impact of associated ‘frailty’ could contribute to this.
Frailty and acute coronary syndromes
Frailty can help predict adverse outcomes in elderly
patients with CAD.30 Of 307 patients aged over 75 years
with non-STEMI. In total, 149 (48.5%) were frail and
experienced increased rates of re-infarction, revasculari￾sation, hospitalisation, major bleeding, stroke and need
for dialysis and mortality compared with non-frail.14
Another study undertaken in patients following STEMI
demonstrated an increased risk of future cardiovascular

events in those with increased frailty.12 In the highest
tertile, 36.7% experienced cardiovascular events com￾pared with 3.2% in the lowest tertile.
Frailty and neurovascular diseases
Frailty has also been associated with neurovascular dis￾eases including stroke, dementia and vascular depres￾sion. Frailty has been shown to have an association with
stroke and cognitive impairment, independent of age,
physical activity level and muscle mass.31 Frail individuals
also have greater cognitive decline with the passage of
time as compared with age-matched non-frail partici￾pants.32 A prospective study at three French centres
assessed 5480 community dwellers aged 65–95 years and
followed them up for 7 years. Frailty was independently
associated with incident vascular dementia but not with
other types of dementia including Alzheimer’s disease.33
It has also been suggested that vascular depression is a
prodrome for frailty.34 These associations have import￾ant bearings on the assessment of frailty because it may
be difficult to distinguish mental and physical frailty and
they may impact the management of associated
comorbidities, compliance with medication and espe￾cially the decision to embark on invasive cardiovascular
therapies.
FRAILTY AND CARDIAC INTERVENTIONS
The number of elderly patients undergoing all forms of
cardiac interventional procedures including revasculari￾sation, valve replacement and the implantation of pace￾makers and other devices has increased in recent years.
Hence, frailty is particularly relevant in all these areas.
Frailty and cardiac surgery
Sundermann et al10 made a CAF in 400 patients aged
74 years and older undergoing elective cardiac surgery.
Patients underwent CABG (n=90), isolated valve surgery
(n=128), transcatheter valve implantation (n=59) or a
combined procedure (n=123). One hundred and ninety￾nine were not frail, 170 had intermediate frailty and 31
were frail. Frailty was a risk factor for 30-day mortality
(p<0.05). Patients who died had a significantly higher
frailty score compared with those who survived
(p=0.001). However, CAF is complex and time consum￾ing. The investigators therefore also tested a simplified
version of the CAF (FORECAST), which took 3–5 min to
complete and was also associated with increased 1-year
mortality. This relationship was confirmed in a study of
3826 patients undergoing cardiac surgery.35 Frailty was
an independent predictor of hospital mortality, delayed
discharge and mid-term survival. Afilalo et al examined
the effect of frailty alongside the STS score. Using a
logistic regression model containing the STS score,
frailty was an independent predictor of mortality and
morbidity and incorporation into the STS model
increased the performance of the latter.36
Frailty and transcatheter aortic valve implantation
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has
emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical aortic
valve replacement for high-risk patients with severe
aortic stenosis. These patients are typically elderly with
multiple comorbidities. Green et al evaluated the impact
of frailty on periprocedural complications and 1-year
mortality. There was no impact of frailty on periproce￾dural complications, but it was associated with 1-year
mortality.37 A Canadian group found frailty to be a pre￾dictor of late mortality alongside chronic obstructive pul￾monary disease, renal impairment and AF.38 These
associations were independent of each other.
Schoenenberger et al39 found that the frailty index
strongly predicted functional decline after TAVI whereas
neither the EuroSCORE nor STS did (p=0.35 and 0.13,
respectively).
Frailty and implantable cardiac device therapy
The mean age of patients included in large randomised
trials of cardiac device therapies was typically 60–65 years
and patients with multiple comorbidities were usually
excluded. Yet the US Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project40 indicates that approximately 45% of patients
receiving cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) and
28% of patients receiving implantable cardioverter defib￾rillator (ICD) are aged 75 or older. Three or more
comorbidities were present in at least 20% of these
patients, suggesting that a substantial proportion were
frail. The role of implantable cardiac devices in frail
elderly patients has yet to be fully explored and there
remains considerable doubt about their clinical value in
this setting. Frailty assessment in studies of CRT, brady￾cardia pacing, biventricular pacing and implantable car￾dioverter defibrillators (ICD) seems overdue. Flint et al41
proposed the incorporation of frailty assessment into the
assessment of patients for left ventricular assist devices
implantation. There are no studies that have formally
explored this.
Frailty and percutaneous coronary intervention
A 3-year study characterised frailty and health status in
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-treated
patients over 65. Of 545 patients, 21% were not frail
while others had some degree of frailty. Frail patients
had more comorbidities and more frequent left main
coronary artery or multivessel disease. The Angina ques￾tionnaire and QoL scores were lower in frail patients.42
Singh et al assessed frailty comorbidity and QoL in 628
patients over the age of 65 years who underwent PCI.
One hundred and thirty were not frail while 415 (66%)
patients had some degree of frailty. Frail patients had
more comorbidities and were more likely to have multi￾vessel disease than non-frail patients. Three-year mortal￾ity was 28% for frail patients and 6% for non-frail. The
addition of frailty to the Mayo clinic risk score increased
the accuracy for the prediction of mortality.43

FRAILTY IN RISK STRATIFICATION FOR
REVASCULARISATION
In a study of 15 382 patients >70 years who underwent
coronary revascularisation, 4-year adjusted actuarial sur￾vival rates for CABG, PCI and medical therapy were
95%, 93.8% and 90.5%, respectively. For patients
>80 years corresponding rates were 77.4%, 71.6% and
60.3%, respectively.7 Elderly patients undergoing coron￾ary revascularisation had a better health status than age￾matched controls who did not undergo intervention.44
Risk stratification in PCI
The highest in-hospital mortality rates following PCI are
seen among elderly patients, however, overall mortality
has decreased in recent years, with the largest absolute
reduction seen in patients >80 years.45 These patients
represent both high risk and high benefit, and the
decision-making process should rely on accurate risk
modelling incorporating frailty. Numerous risk stratifica￾tion models for PCI and CABG have been developed,
but they perform poorly in elderly patients with multiple
comorbidities. Most current models of risk in the field
of CVD are heavily weighted towards age. With all other
variables used in the scores kept the same, risk con￾tinues to increase with age alone. Thus, an otherwise
healthy 80-year-old individual has a significantly higher
risk score than a 60 year-old, regardless of how healthy,
independent or non-frail he or she is (figure 3). The
presence of comorbidities is used as a surrogate of
frailty. However, this neglects those that are frail without
significant comorbidities. Additionally, overestimation of
risk in the elderly non-frail can occur.
PCI is increasingly used for treating elderly patients
with acute coronary syndrome, often with little or no
opportunities for any form of frailty assessment.
Predicting risks and benefits is challenging because the
proportion of elderly patients in randomised revasculari￾sation trials is lower than seen in the ‘real world’.
Existing models for outcome after PCI lack assessment
of long-term prognosis. For example, the Mayo clinic
score predicts in-hospital mortality but not long-term
outcomes or QoL.43 The addition of frailty to the Mayo
clinic risk score increased the accuracy of the prediction
(using the c-statistic) of mortality from 0.63 to 0.68 and
of mortality/MI from 0.57 to 0.61.46 Further studies
addressing the ability of frailty scores to improve predic￾tion of morbidity and mortality associated with coronary
revascularisation are needed.
Risk stratification in cardiac surgery
The two most widely used models of perioperative risk in
cardiac surgery are the EuroSCORE II and the STS score
both of which, like most risk models, are inaccurate in
estimating individual risk.10 47 In both, medical diagnoses
and comorbidities are heavily weighted, yet frailty is not
represented. Although these allude to a prediction of
frailty, this is not comprehensive and a role for frailty in
risk stratification independent of both age and comorbid￾ities exists. The updated EuroSCORE II includes ‘poor
mobility’ as a risk factor. This allows a representation of
frailty and improves the accuracy of the score. However,
mobility alone does not necessarily equate to frailty. It
may be a simple surrogate in some circumstances, but the
score does not define poor mobility or permit its quantifi￾cation beyond a simple ‘present’ or ‘absent’. With ageing
of the patient population, these models underestimate
risk at higher levels.48 The incorporation of frailty into
these scores has the potential to increase their accuracy.
The correlations between the CAF and EuroSCORE and
STS scores are low (0.35 and 0.42, respectively),10 suggest￾ing that CAF overlaps only partly with EuroSCORE and
STS score and may therefore augment them. Afilalo
et al36 found no correlation between frailty as assessed by
time taken to walk 5 m and STS score and showed that
incorporation of frailty into the STS model increased the
performance of the latter.
CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Frailty is increasingly recognised as a specific clinical
condition associated with poorer outcomes in many
areas of medicine and surgery. Recommendations
related to frailty have already been incorporated into
Figure 3 Age versus predicted mortality in the EuroSCORE and New York percutaneous coronary intervention scores, with all
other variables kept as normal.

medical guidelines for diabetes. With further work, this
could be replicated in other areas including cardiology
and cardiac surgery. It is important that cardiologists
and cardiothoracic surgeons are aware of how to assess
frailty and of its potential impact on clinical outcomes.
At present, there is no consensus on how to assess frailty
and a number of clinical trials are using different frailty
scales. Which of these scores has the best predictive
power, and which is most appropriate in specific clinical
settings remains to be determined. However, it is clear
that a simple, universally applicable and readily under￾stood frailty ‘score’ is much needed. In addition, many
studies simply split frailty into ‘frail’ or ‘non-frail’, which
does not accurately represent the typical patient popula￾tion, most of which have some degree of frailty. It is
perhaps better to use a gradation of frailty; for example,
the Canadian study of health and ageing score, or a
score, which allows discrimination of severely frail high￾risk individuals could also be helpful. It is possible that a
universal tool would not be applicable in all settings and
that each specialty may need to find a frailty tool that
suits their own needs. The concept of a community￾based frailty score for all elderly patients is an attractive
idea and one that could be readily achieved within the
primary care contractual system (QoF). This would
ensure that all frail patients presenting acutely to sec￾ondary care services would be flagged in advance and
decision-making could be modified accordingly.
Frailty still plays little formal part in most decision￾making processes in CVD. In line with contemporary
guidelines, decisions are ideally made in multidisciplin￾ary team meetings (the ‘heart-team’).49 The majority of
the team will have never met the patient, and rely on a
subjective patchy and probably inaccurate description of
health status together with cardiac imaging. A formal
assessment of frailty could help in providing more object￾ive and transparent decision-making in this setting. With
increasing evidence highlighting the predictive power of
frailty across cardiovascular medicine, our focus needs to
be directed at how we can incorporate this into current
methods of risk assessment. The Royal College of
Emergency Medicine has suggested developing specia￾lised ‘Frailty Units’ for frail elderly patients. A recent
practical example of using frailty in decision-making has
been established by the European Working Group on
target guidelines for diabetes by recommending a conser￾vative glycated haemoglobin in frail patients compared
with age-matched non-frail.50 In keeping with the AHA
guidelines, more elderly and frail people should be
included in future trials, as well as focusing on QoL out￾comes in addition to mortality. Incorporating frailty
assessment in risk scoring and decision-making will help
to decide whether a frail patient should undergo a pro￾cedure or whether it might improve QoL.
CONCLUSION
Frailty is an independent risk factor for adverse out￾comes in CVD and following cardiac intervention. As we
are faced with an increased number of elderly patients
with CVD and frailty, frailty assessment can help in risk
stratification and decision-making, thereby improving
outcomes and QoL, and preventing unnecessary harm
in the most frail. We need to measure frailty in a consist￾ent way in clinical studies, and find a way to incorporate
measures of frailty in outcome studies.
