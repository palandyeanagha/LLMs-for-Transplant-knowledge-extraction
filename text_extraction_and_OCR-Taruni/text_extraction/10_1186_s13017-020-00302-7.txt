Abstract
Liver injuries represent one of the most frequent life-threatening injuries in trauma patients. In determining the
optimal management strategy, the anatomic injury, the hemodynamic status, and the associated injuries should be
taken into consideration. Liver trauma approach may require non-operative or operative management with the
intent to restore the homeostasis and the normal physiology. The management of liver trauma should be
multidisciplinary including trauma surgeons, interventional radiologists, and emergency and ICU physicians. The aim
of this paper is to present the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) liver trauma management guidelines.
Keywords: Liver trauma, Adult, Pediatric, Minor, Moderate, Severe, Classification, Guidelines, Surgery, Hemorrhage,

Background
Liver trauma is one of the most common abdominal le￾sions in severely injured trauma patients [1]. Diagnosis
and treatment of hepatic trauma has evolved with the
use of modern diagnostic and therapeutic tools [2–4].
Until two to three decades ago, most cases with blunt
abdominal trauma and possible injury in parenchymat￾ous organs were managed by exploratory laparotomy [5].
Several innovative multimodal approaches as EVTM
(endovascular trauma and bleeding management) have
allowed to greatly increase the likelihood of non￾operative management (NOM) for selected patients.
Nowadays, even borderline patients or transient re￾sponder, without other indications for laparotomy, may
be considered for NOM in selected and well-developed
trauma centers. This advanced strategy necessitates a
multidisciplinary approach to deal with the complexity
of moderate and severe liver injury. The majority of pa￾tients admitted with liver injuries have minor or moder￾ate injuries (WSES I, II, III) (AAST-OIS I, II, or III) and
are successfully treated by NOM. In contrast, one third
of severe injuries (WSES IV, V) (AAST-OIS IV, V) allow
for NOM [6]. In pediatric patients, NOM should be con￾sidered the optimal management approach. In determin￾ing the optimal treatment strategy, the anatomical
description of liver lesions is fundamental but not suffi￾cient. In fact, the decision whether patients need to be
managed operatively or undergo NOM is based mainly
on the hemodynamic status, associated injuries, and on
the anatomical liver injury grade.
The aim of this manuscript is to present the updated
World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) liver
trauma management guidelines.

Notes on the use of the guidelines
The guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of rec￾ommendation based on the evidence. The guidelines
present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for opti￾mal management of liver trauma. The practice guide￾lines promulgated in this work do not represent a
standard of practice. These are suggested plans of care,
based on best available evidence and the consensus of
experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as be￾ing within the standard of practice. For example, they
should not be used to compel adherence to a given
method of medical management, which method should
be finally determined after taking account of the condi￾tions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, ex￾perience, equipment, etc.), and the characteristics of the
individual patient. However, responsibility for the results
of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged
therein, and not with the consensus group.
Methods
A computerized search was done by the bibliographer in
different databanks (MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE).
Citations were included for the period between January
1990 and October 2019 using the primary search strat￾egy: liver, injuries, trauma, hepatic, adult, pediatric,
hemodynamic instability/stability, angioembolization,
management, nonoperative, conservative, operative, sur￾gery, diagnosis, and follow-up, combined with AND/OR.
No search restrictions were imposed. The dates were se￾lected to allow comprehensive published abstracts of
clinical trials, consensus conference, comparative studies,
congresses, guidelines, government publication, multi￾center studies, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, large
case series, original articles, and randomized controlled
trials. Case reports and small case series were excluded.
Narrative review articles were also analyzed to determine
if other cited studies should be included.
The level of evidence (LE) was evaluated using the
GRADE system [7] (Table 1).
A group of experts in the field coordinated by a cen￾tral coordinator was contacted to express their evidence￾based opinion on several issues about the pediatric (<
16 years old) and adult liver trauma [8, 9]. Hepatic
trauma was assessed by the anatomy of the injury, type
of injury (blunt and penetrating injury), management
(conservative and operative management), and type of
patient (adults, pediatrics). Through the Delphi process,
different issues were discussed in subsequent rounds.
The central coordinator assembled the different answers
derived from each round. Each version was then revised
and improved. An expert group discussed the definitive
version. The final version about on agreement was
reached resulted in the present manuscript. Statements
are summarized in Table 4.
Definitions
In adult patients, hemodynamic instability is considered
the condition in which admission systolic blood pressure
is < 90 mmHg with clinical evidence of hemorrhagic
shock with skin vasoconstriction (cool, clammy, de￾creased capillary refill), altered level of consciousness
and/or shortness of breath, or > 90 mmHg but requiring
bolus infusions/transfusions and/or vasopressor drugs
and/or admission base excess (BE) > -5 mmol/l or trans￾fusion requirement of at least > 4 units of packed red
blood cells within the first 8 h. Transient responder pa￾tients (adult and pediatric) are those showing an initial
response to adequate fluid resuscitation, but then subse￾quent signs of ongoing blood loss and perfusion deficits.
These patients have an initial response to therapy but do
not reach sufficient stabilization to undergo endovascu￾lar procedures or NOM.
In pediatric patients, hemodynamic stability is consid￾ered a systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg plus twice
the child’s age in years. An acceptable hemodynamic sta￾tus in children is considered a positive response to fluid
resuscitation: 2 boluses of 20 mL/kg of crystalloid re￾placement should be administered before blood replace￾ment leading to heart rate reduction, cleared sensorium,
return of peripheral pulses, normal skin color, increase
in blood pressure and urinary output, and an increase in
warmth of the skin in the extremities. Clinical judgment
however is fundamental in evaluating pediatric patients.
WSES classification
The WSES classification (Table 2) divides liver injuries
into four classes considering the AAST-OIS classifica￾tion (Table 3) and the hemodynamic status (Table 4):
 Minor (WSES grade I)
 Moderate (WSES grade II)
 Severe (WSES grade III and IV)
Minor hepatic injuries:
 WSES grade I includes AAST-OIS grade I–II
hemodynamically stable lesions.
Moderate hepatic injuries:
 WSES grade II includes AAST-OIS grade III
hemodynamically stable lesions.
Severe hepatic injuries:
 WSES grade III includes AAST-OIS grade IV–V
hemodynamically stable lesions.
 WSES grade IV includes AAST-OIS grade I–VI
hemodynamically unstable lesions.

Based on the present classification, we suggest two
management algorithms: one general (Fig. 1) and one
specifically dedicated to hemodynamically unstable pa￾tients (Fig. 2).
Diagnosis
 The diagnostic methods on admission are
determined by the hemodynamic status (GoR 1A).
 Extended-focused abdominal sonography for trauma
(E-FAST) is rapid in detecting intra-abdominal free
fluid (GoR 1A).
 CT scan with intravenous contrast is the gold
standard in hemodynamically stable trauma patients
(GoR 1A).
Careful physical examination is of paramount import￾ance in determining the need for exploratory laparotomy
[10]. E-FAST is useful and generally reliable in trauma
in general. However, abdominal ultrasound may be
falsely negative due to clotted blood or suboptimal qual￾ity views [11–13]. In the pediatric population, reported
sensitivity and specificity ranges from 42 to 52% and 96
to 98%, with a negative predicting value for intra￾abdominal fluid of 93–96% [8, 9, 14–16]. The low sensi￾tivity of E-FAST in hemodynamically stable pediatric pa￾tients may warrant further investigation, specifically
contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) or abdomen/pelvis
CT scan or magnetic resonance, in hemodynamically
stable pediatric patients with a high degree of suspicion
for intra-abdominal injury (abnormal physical examin￾ation, abnormal laboratory values, or other radiologic
studies).
Computed tomography (CT) scan is considered the
gold standard in trauma imaging assessment with a sen￾sitivity and specificity approaching 96–100% [17–19].
CT must be immediately available and performed only
in hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients or in
those who transiently responded to fluid resuscitation in
special circumstances and under the supervision of the
trauma team [20, 21]. Delayed-phase CT helps in differ￾entiating patients with active bleeding from those with
contained vascular injuries [22]. This data is important
to reduce the risk of discrepancy between CT scan im￾ages and angiographic images (only 47% of patients have
a confirmation of the CT findings at angiography) [22].
Active contrast extravasation is a sign of active
hemorrhage [23]. CT scan may help in subsequent

surgical procedures and angiography/angioembolization
(AG/AE) [24–32].
Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) should be consid￾ered diagnostic modality in low-resource settings, where
CT scan or US is not promptly available [33]. It should
be considered in the presence of massive subcutaneous
emphysema in a shocked patient in whom ultrasound
cannot be done and/or in the presence of free peritoneal
fluid without solid organ injury in a hemodynamically
stable patient. The possibility of DPL-related complica￾tions (up to 2%) should be considered [33].
Non-operative management

Table 4 Statements summary
Statements
Diagnostic procedures - The diagnostic methods on admission are determined by the hemodynamic status (GoR 1A).
- E-FAST is rapid in detecting intra-abdominal free fluid (GoR 1A).
- CT scan with intravenous contrast is the gold standard in hemodynamically stable trauma patients (GoR 1A).
Non-operative management
(NOM)
- NOM should be the treatment of choice for all hemodynamically stable minor (WSES I) (AAST I–II), moderate
(WSES II) (AAST III), and severe (WSES III) (AAST IV–V) injuries in the absence of other internal injuries requiring
surgery (GoR 2A).
- In patients considered transient responders with moderate (WSES II) (AAST III) and severe (WSES III) (AAST IV–V)
injuries, NOM should be considered only in selected settings provided the immediate availability of trained
surgeons, operating room, continuous monitoring ideally in an ICU or ER setting, access to angiography,
angioembolization, blood and blood products, and in locations where a system exists to quickly transfer such
patients to higher level of care facilities (GoR 2B).
- A CT scan with intravenous contrast should always be performed in patients being considered for NOM (GoR 2A).
- AG/AE may be considered as a first-line intervention in hemodynamically stable patients with arterial blush on CT
scan (GoR 2B).
- In hemodynamically stable children, the presence of contrast blush on CT scan is not an absolute indication for
AG/AE (GoR 2B).
- Serial clinical evaluations (physical exams and laboratory testing) must be performed to detect a change in clinical
status during NOM (GoR 2A).
- NOM should be attempted in the setting of concomitant head trauma and/or spinal cord injuries with reliable
clinical exam, unless the patient could not achieve specific hemodynamic goals for the neurotrauma and the
instability might be due to intra-abdominal bleeding (GoR 2B).
- Intensive care unit admission in isolated liver injury may be required only for moderate (WSES II) (AAST III) and
severe (WSES III) (AAST IV–V) lesions (GoR 2B).
- In selected cases where an intra-abdominal injury is suspected in the days after the initial trauma, interval
laparoscopic exploration may be considered as an extension of NOM and a means to plan patient management
in a step-up treatment strategy (GoR 2C).
- In low-resource settings, NOM could be considered in patients with hemodynamic stability without evidence of
associated injuries, with negative serial physical examinations and negative imaging and blood tests (GoR 2C).
Operative management (OM) - Hemodynamically unstable and non-responder patients (WSES IV) should undergo OM (GoR 2A).
- Primary surgical intention should be to control the hemorrhage and bile leak and initiation of damage control
resuscitation as soon as possible (GoR 2A).
- Major hepatic resections should be avoided at first and only considered in subsequent operations, in a resectional
debridement fashion in cases of large areas of devitalized liver tissue done by experienced surgeons (GoR 2B).
- Angioembolization is a useful tool in case of persistent arterial bleeding after non-hemostatic or damage control
procedures (GoR 2A).
- Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (i.e., REBOA) may be used in hemodynamically unstable
patients as a bridge to other more definitive procedures for hemorrhage control (GoR 2B).
Short- and long-term
follow-up
- Intrahepatic abscesses may be successfully treated with percutaneous drainage (GoR 2A).
- Delayed hemorrhage without severe hemodynamic compromise may be managed at first with AG/AE (GoR 2A).
- Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm should be managed with AG/AE to prevent rupture (GoR 2A).
- Symptomatic or infected bilomas should be managed with percutaneous drainage (GoR 2A).
- Combination of percutaneous drainage and endoscopic techniques may be considered in managing post-traumatic
biliary complications not suitable for percutaneous management alone (GoR 2B).
- lavage/drainage and endoscopic stenting may be considered as the first approach in delayed post-traumatic biliary
fistula without any other indication for laparotomy (GoR 2B).
- Laparoscopy as initial approach should be considered in cases of delayed surgery, so as to minimize the invasiveness
of surgical intervention and to tailor the procedure to the lesion (GoR 2B).
Thrombo-prophylaxis, feeding,
and mobilization
- Mechanical prophylaxis is safe and should be considered in all patients with no absolute contraindication (GoR 2A).
- LMWH-based prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible following trauma and may be safe in selected
patients with liver injury treated with NOM (GoR 2B).
- In those patients taking anticoagulants, individualization of the risk-benefit balance of anticoagulant reversal is
suggested (GoR 1C).
- Early mobilization should be achieved in stable patients (GoR 2A).
- In the absence of contraindications, enteral feeding should be started as soon as possible (GoR 2A).

plan patient management in a step-up treatment
strategy (GoR 2C).
 In low-resource settings, NOM could be considered
in patients with hemodynamic stability without evi￾dence of associated injuries, with negative serial
physical examinations and negative imaging and
blood tests (GoR 2C).
Absolute requirements for NOM are hemodynamic
stability and absence of other lesions requiring surgery
[9, 15, 34–39]. In hemodynamically stable patients with￾out other associated injuries requiring OM, NOM is
considered the standard of care [8, 14, 15]. The concept
is valid for both: blunt (BT) and penetrating trauma
(PT). Attempting NOM in moderate (WSES II) (AAST￾OIS III) and severe (WSES III) (AAST-OIS IV–V) blunt
or penetrating injuries requires the ability to diagnose all
associated injuries and to provide intensive management
(continuous clinical monitoring, serial hemoglobin mon￾itoring, and around-the-clock availability of trained
surgeons, CT scanning, angiography, OR, and blood and
blood products) [16, 40–44].
As a general consideration, great attention should be
paid in selecting PT for NOM especially in the case of
gunshot wound (GSW) and even more if thoraco￾abdominal. They should be considered for NOM only in
centers with experience in dealing with PT. Even in pa￾tients presenting with stable conditions and with no evi￾dence of other intra-abdominal/internal injuries, interval
laparoscopy should be always considered in order to
confirm the absence of other injuries requiring surgical
repair.
In PT, NOM feasibility has been reported [35–37, 45–
49] with 50% and 85% success rate of NOM for stab
wounds (SW) in anterior and posterior abdomen re￾spectively [34, 50]. Similar managing strategy can be ap￾plied to GSWs [35, 45]. Necessary distinction between
low- and high-energy penetrating trauma however is
mandatory when deciding for OM or NOM. Low-energy
PT (SW and low-energy GSW) may be safely treated

with NOM at first, provided the patient is
hemodynamically stable and no other injuries require
surgery. In considering NOM, interval laparoscopy
should be considered to rule out missed intra-abdominal
injuries. High-energy GSW and other ballistic injuries
are less amenable to NOM, and in 90% of cases, OM is
required [34, 36, 51]. In abdominal GSWs, up to 25% of
non-therapeutic laparotomy has been reported [51], con￾firming the need to have strict selection criteria for OM
or NOM even in the GSW cohort. Associated head and
spinal cord injuries (that preclude affordable clinical
examination) and significant reduction in hemoglobin
requiring > 4 units of blood transfusion in the first 8 h
[34, 45] have been suggested as predictive criteria of
NOM failure in abdominal GSWs.
Patient selection is influenced by the diagnostic cap￾ability and accuracy. In fact, the accuracy of CT scan
in SWs has been questioned [37, 50]. Even in the
presence of a negative CT scan, exploratory laparos￾copy/laparotomy may be necessary [37]. Interval
laparoscopy is a useful tool to be considered in obese
patients or in the presence a long and tangential
wound tract or when the trajectory is difficult to de￾termine on CT scan [34, 37]. In anterior abdominal
SW, local wound exploration (LWE) is generally ac￾curate in evaluating penetration depth; small external
wounds may be enlarged for precise LWE and deter￾mination of anterior fascia violation [34, 35]. LWE,
however, may be misleading, and patients should be
admitted for observation if equivocal. Wounds close
to the inferior costal margin should be evaluated by
LWE with caution and only if strictly necessary.
GSWs undergoing NOM may warrant a CT scan to
determine the trajectory [45, 51]. CT scan specificity and
sensitivity of 96% and 90.5% respectively for GSWs re￾quiring laparotomy have been reported [52]. The gold
standard to decide for OM or NOM remains the clinical
examination [34, 51] associated with laboratory and
radiological evaluation. Strict clinical and hemoglobin
evaluation should be done (every 6 h for at least 24 h);
after index CT scan allowing for NOM, serial ecoghra￾phical evaluation may be utilized to help in defining pa￾tient clinical evolution. Once stabilized, patients are
usually transferred from ICU to the ward [35, 45, 50].
NOM is contraindicated if free intra- or retro￾peritoneal air, free intra-peritoneal fluid in the absence
of solid organ injury, localized bowel wall thickening,
bullet tract close to hollow viscus with surrounding
hematoma [46], and in high-energy penetrating trauma
are detected at CT scan.
In selected centers, AE is considered as an “extension”
of NOM in patients with liver injuries presenting with
ongoing resuscitative needs [9, 53, 54]. If required, AE
can be safely repeated.
In children, the use of primary hepatic AE has been re￾ported rarely and is debated even in the presence of ar￾terial blush where it seems to increase NOM failure
rates [55], or according to some studies, it does not cor￾relate with decrease odds of laparotomy [30]. In the
pediatric population, AE use is associated with older age
and is not completely defined in terms of efficacy and
cost-effectiveness, especially in low-resource settings [30,
55–61]. Some authors, however, identify the presence of
active contrast extravasation as an independent predictor
for pseudoaneurysm (PSA) formation in children, re￾gardless of injury grade. This suggests a thorough
follow-up during NOM of these patients, so to obtain an
early identification and angiographic treatment of PSA
[62].
The biggest risk of NOM in penetrating trauma is a
missed abdominal injury, especially hollow viscus perfor￾ation [34, 46]. However, no increase in mortality rates
with missed hollow viscus perforation has been reported
in patients without peritonitis on admission [63]. As a
counterpart, non-therapeutic laparotomy leads to an in￾crease in morbidity [63]. Moreover, OM in penetrating
liver injuries has a higher liver-related complication rate
(50–52%) compared to blunt injuries [34, 46].
During NOM for liver injuries, no standard early
follow-up and monitoring protocols exist in adult or in
children [34]. Serial clinical evaluation and hemoglobin
measurement represent the cornerstone in evaluating
NOM patients [14]. Bedsides, US may represent an af￾fordable tool during early follow-up. Presence of large
subcapsular hematomas is not a strict indication for
OM, but a higher risk of NOM failure exists. In any case,
these patients should undergo serial blood test: increas￾ing levels of transaminases could indicate the presence
of intrahepatic parenchymal ischemia or rare cases of
torsion of suprahepatic veins [64]. ICU admission may
be indicated for moderate (WSES II) (AAST III) and se￾vere (WSES III–IV) (AAST IV–V) liver trauma in order
to reduce the mortality risk [26].
If available, interval laparoscopy during NOM provides
important information about the evolution of the injury.
Laparoscopy should be considered an important tool in
the NOM of liver injuries, and it could be used as a
bridge strategy to plan an immediate or subsequent lap￾aroscopic/laparotomy intervention [65].
Particular attention should be paid in managing
hemodynamically stable patients with liver trauma as￾sociated with spinal trauma (ST) and severe traumatic
brain injury (STBI). In blunt trauma, NOM should
apply to all patients with no other indication to lapar￾otomy. However, the optimal management of con￾comitant STBI and/or ST and penetrating liver
injuries is debated and OM in general could be sug￾gested as safer [45, 48, 66].
Coccolini et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:24 Page 8 of 15

Patients affected by neurotrauma (i.e., spinal cord
or moderate-severe traumatic brain injury) in fact, for
several instances, differ from the others because they
need a higher perfusion pressure to adequately supply
oxygen to the brain and to the spinal cord to reduce
the subsequent burden of disability and mortality. A
disruption of the normal blood flow regulation in the
central nervous system (CNS) characterizes the
trauma and eventually leads to a blood flow
dependent on perfusion pressure in ischemic tissue
[67]. Specific hemodynamic goals for ST and STBI
are defined as SBP > 110 mmHg and/or a CPP be￾tween 60 and 70 mmHg in the case of moderate/se￾vere TBI and an MBP > 80 mmHg in case of ST [68,
69]. To date, no study specifically addressed the
NOM of abdominal solid organ injuries in the neuro￾trauma patient, and several authors have considered it
an exclusion criterion from NOM [45, 48, 70]. How￾ever, since the first goal is to have a stable patient
with adequate perfusion pressure, there is no rationale
in denying NOM to these patients, as long as the
specific hemodynamic goals are met.
Operative management
 Hemodynamically unstable and non-responder pa￾tients (WSES IV) should undergo OM (GoR 2A).
 Primary surgical intention should be to control the
hemorrhage and bile leak and initiation of damage
control resuscitation as soon as possible (GoR 2A).
 Major hepatic resections should be avoided at first
and only considered in subsequent operations, in a
resectional debridement fashion in cases of large
areas of devitalized liver tissue done by experienced
surgeons (GoR 2B).
 Angioembolization is a useful tool in case of
persistent arterial bleeding after non-hemostatic or
damage control procedures (GoR 2A).
 Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the
aorta (i.e., REBOA) may be used in
hemodynamically unstable patients as a bridge to
other more definitive procedures for hemorrhage
control (GoR 2B).
At laparotomy, if no major bleeding is present, com￾pression alone or electrocautery, bipolar devices, argon
beam coagulation, topical hemostatic agents, simple su￾ture of the hepatic parenchyma, or omental patching
may be sufficient to stop the bleeding [34, 66, 71–73].
In case of major hemorrhage, more aggressive proce￾dures including manual compression and hepatic pack￾ing, ligation of vessels in the wound, hepatic
debridement and finger fracture, balloon tamponade,
shunting procedures, or hepatic vascular isolation and
exclusion may be used [64, 74]. Of paramount import￾ance is to provide simultaneous intraoperative intensive
resuscitation with early institution of a massive transfu￾sion protocol (MTP) aiming to maintain organ perfusion
and ultimately reverse all trauma-induced physiological
derangements [34, 71, 73, 75].
In case of evident injury to the proper hepatic artery,
an attempt to control and repair it should be made. If
not effective or not possible, selective hepatic artery
ligation should be considered as a viable option. If the
injury is on the right or left branches of the proper hep￾atic artery, selective ligation is advisable. If the right or
common hepatic artery must be ligated, cholecystectomy
should be performed to avoid gallbladder necrosis [2,
76]. If the patient’s condition allows for it, post-operative
AE represents a viable alternative allowing hemorrhage
control while reducing complications [34, 66, 71, 77].
Hepatic artery ligation increases the risk of hepatic ne￾crosis, abscesses, and biloma formation [34].
Portal vein injuries should be repaired primarily. Portal
vein main branch ligation should not be considered and
should be avoided because of the high risk of liver ne￾crosis or massive bowel edema. If no other option exists,
ligation can be used, but only in patients with an intact
hepatic artery. Liver packing or liver resection should be
preferred to ligation in case of lobar or segmental/sub￾segmental portal venous branch injuries [34, 76].
Whenever Pringle maneuver or arterial control fails
and bleeding persists, the presence of an aberrant hep￾atic artery should be considered. If the bleeding comes
from behind the liver, retro-hepatic caval or hepatic vein
injury should be highly suspected [34, 77]. Three viable
options exist for the management of retrohepatic caval/
suprahepatic venous injuries: (1) tamponade with hepatic
packing, (2) direct repair (with or without vascular isola￾tion), and (3) lobar resection [38, 78–80]. Liver packing
is the least risky method to temporarily deal with severe
venous injuries [34, 66, 81–83]. Direct venous repair is
difficult especially in non-experienced hands, with high
mortality rates [34, 66].
Different techniques of hepatic vascular exclusion with
shunting procedures have been described, most of them
anecdotally. The veno-veno bypass (femoral vein and in￾ferior mesenteric vein to axillary or jugular vein by pass)
and the use of fenestrated stent grafts are the most fre￾quently used [66, 71, 76, 84]. The atrio-caval shunt by￾passes the retro-hepatic cava blood through the right
atrium using a chest tube put into the inferior vena cava.
Mortality rates in such a complicated situations are very
high and usually related to the fact that the decision to
perform the shunt is made late in the case [71].
Complete vascular exclusion of the liver is generally
poorly tolerated in the unstable patient with major blood
loss [34].
Coccolini et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:24 Page 9 of 15

Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the
aorta (REBOA) catheter in zone I should be considered
if despite all damage control procedures, there is still ac￾tive surgical bleeding. Simultaneously, the large high
flow femoral venous catheter should be exchanged over
a guide wire to an introducer with the aim of floating up
and inflating a resuscitative endovascular balloon occlu￾sion of the vena cava (REBOVC) at the level of the
retro-hepatic vena cava. The goal is to achieve proximal
and distal vascular control of a possible retro-hepatic/
supra-hepatic vessel injury with the REBOVC and ultim￾ately obtaining complete combined endovascular/open
liver isolation with the Pringle maneuver. A supra￾diaphragmatic central venous access must be obtained
prior to inflating the REBOA/REBOVC [85–91].
In cases of liver avulsion or total crush injury, when a
total hepatic resection is indicated, hepatic transplant￾ation has been described [76]. A retrospective study
based on the European Liver Transplant Registry identi￾fies an ISS score less than 33 for recipient selection, so
to avoid futile procedures [92].
Anatomic hepatic resection may seldom be considered
as a surgical option [6, 93, 94]. In unstable patients and
during damage control surgery, it should be avoided, but
in case of need, a non-anatomic resection is safer and
easier [34, 66, 71, 76]. For staged liver procedures, either
anatomic or non-anatomic resections may be safely per￾formed by experienced surgeons [76].
Temporary abdominal closure may be indicated if the
risk of abdominal compartment syndrome is high or in
those situation where a “second look” operation is
needed [71–73].
Two principal indications for post-operative
angiography-embolization (AG-AE) have been proposed:
(1) after initial operative hemostasis, in stable or stabi￾lized patients with contrast blush at completion CT
scan; and (2) as adjunctive hemostatic tool in patients
with uncontrolled suspected arterial bleeding despite
emergency laparotomy and hemostasis attempt [34, 54,
95–99]. Recent evidence suggests that routine use of im￾mediate post-damage control hepatic angiography re￾duces mortality in grade IV/V hepatic injuries [100].
Complications
 Intrahepatic abscesses may be successfully treated
with percutaneous drainage (GoR 2A).
 Delayed hemorrhage without severe hemodynamic
compromise may be managed at first with AG/AE
(GoR 2A).
 Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm should be managed
with AG/AE to prevent rupture (GoR 2A).
 Symptomatic or infected bilomas should be
managed with percutaneous drainage (GoR 2A).
 Combination of percutaneous drainage and
endoscopic techniques may be considered in
managing post-traumatic biliary complications not
suitable for percutaneous management alone (GoR
2B).
 Laparoscopic lavage/drainage and endoscopic
stenting may be considered as the first approach in
delayed post-traumatic biliary fistula without any
other indication for laparotomy (GoR 2B).
 Laparoscopy as initial approach should be
considered in cases of delayed surgery, so as to
minimize the invasiveness of surgical intervention
and to tailor the procedure to the lesion (GoR 2B).
In blunt hepatic trauma, particularly after high-grade
injury, complications occur in 12–14% of patients [9,
66]. Diagnostic tools for complications after NOM in￾clude clinical examination, blood tests, ultrasound, and
CT scan. Routine follow-up with CT scan is not neces￾sary unless there is clinical suspicion of a complication
[6, 9, 66]. In the presence of abnormal inflammatory re￾sponse, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, or drop of
hemoglobin level, repeated CT scan is recommended
[9]. Bleeding, abdominal compartment syndrome, infec￾tions (abscesses and other infections), biliary complica￾tions (bile leak, hemobilia, biloma, biliary peritonitis,
biliary fistula), and liver necrosis are the most frequent
complications associated with NOM [16, 66]. Ultrasound
is useful in the assessment of bile leak/biloma in grade
IV–V injuries, especially with a central laceration.
Re-bleeding or secondary hemorrhage is the most fre￾quently reported complications after NOM as in subcap￾sular hematoma or pseudo-aneurysm (PSA) rupture
(range 1.7–5.9%) with a mortality rate up to 18% [9, 66,
101, 102]. In the majority of cases (69%), “late” bleeding
can be treated non-operatively [9, 66].
Hepatic artery PSA is a rare complication with a
prevalence of 1% [103]. Asymptomatic PSA should be
treated as early as possible with AE because of the high
risk of rupture and the associated high morbidity [34,
104, 105]. In patients with melena or hematemesis fol￾lowing liver trauma, bleeding from the ampulla of Vater
(hemobilia) is highly suggestive of ruptured intrahepatic
PSA [106, 107]. AE is the treatment of choice [6, 34, 66].
In the presence of intrahepatic bilio-venous fistula (fre￾quently associated with bilemia), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) represents an effect￾ive tool [108].
Biliary complications include biloma, biliary fistula, bil￾hemia, and bile peritonitis (incidence 2.8–30%) [8, 40].
Most traumatic bilomas regress spontaneously. Enlar￾ging, symptomatic or infected bilomas can be success￾fully managed with percutaneous drainage. Percutaneous
drainage may be combined with therapeutic ERCP with
Coccolini et al. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020) 15:24 Page 10 of 15

eventual endobiliary stent placement [9, 101, 109–111].
Bile peritonitis has been usually treated with laparotomy.
Combination of laparoscopic irrigation/drainage and
endoscopic bile duct stent placement may represent a
valid alternative [101, 102, 112, 113].
Abscesses are rare after NOM and usually happen in
severe lesions (prevalence 0.6–7%) [9, 66, 114–117]. CT
scan or ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage is the
treatment of choice with high success rate and no re￾ported mortality [106]. In the presence of necrosis and
devascularization of hepatic segments, surgical manage￾ment may be indicated whenever affecting patient condi￾tion [34, 66].
Generally, once stabilization of traumatized patient is
obtained, late complications should be managed prefer￾entially by minimally invasive procedures. Laparoscopy
and endoscopy are part of this approach, which became
possible in a delayed surgery setting [64, 65, 118, 119].
Thromboprophylaxis, feeding, and mobilization
 Mechanical prophylaxis is safe and should be
considered in all patients with no absolute
contraindication (GoR 2A).
 LMWH-based prophylaxis should be started as soon
as possible following trauma and may be safe in
selected patients with liver injury treated with NOM
(GoR 2B).
 In those patients taking anticoagulants,
individualization of the risk-benefit balance of anti￾coagulant reversal is suggested (GoR 1C).
 Early mobilization should be achieved in stable
patients (GoR 2A).
 In the absence of contraindications, enteral feeding
should be started as soon as possible (GoR 2A).
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the great
risks of trauma victims, because patients enter a hyper￾coagulation state within 48 h from injury [120–122].
More than 50% of patients without thrombo-prophylaxis
may develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subse￾quent pulmonary embolism (PE) which carries a moral￾ity rate up to 50% [120, 121]. PE is the third leading
cause of death in trauma patients.
No differences in complication, mortality, and NOM
failure rate were demonstrated when thrombo￾prophylaxis was administered within and after 48 and
72 h from the initial injury in patients without STBI and
BST [123–125]. Early mobilization is not related to
NOM failure and secondary bleeding [126]. However,
VTE rates seem to be over fourfold when LMWH is ad￾ministered > 72 h from admission [120].
In patients taking anticoagulants, it is important to
evaluate the eventual need for reversal therapy in order
to balance the risk of bleeding against the benefit of pre￾venting thrombotic complications. Poor outcomes derive
from the failure to restore the anticoagulation as soon as
possible [127].
Early enteral feeding is associated with improved clin￾ical outcomes when administered within the first 72 h
from admission in ICU [128], and it should be delayed
only in cases of uncontrolled shock, use of vasopressor
therapy, uncontrolled hypoxaemia and acidosis, uncon￾trolled upper GI bleeding, gastric aspirate > 500 ml/6 h,
bowel ischemia, bowel obstruction, abdominal compart￾ment syndrome, and high-output fistula without distal
feeding access [129]. Oral intake, when possible, should
be initiated after 24–48 h from the traumatic event.
Follow-up
Mandatory late follow-up imaging is not indicated, and
it should be used only if the patient’s clinical condition
and/or symptoms indicating a complication require it
for diagnosis. The majority of liver lesions heal in about
4 months [14, 66]. After moderate and severe liver injur￾ies, patients may usually resume normal physical activ￾ities after 3–4 months.
During the recovery phase, patients should be encour￾aged to not remain alone for long periods and to return
immediately to the hospital in case of increasing abdom￾inal pain, lightheadedness, nausea, or vomiting [14, 34].
Conclusions
Management of liver trauma is multidisciplinary. When
feasible, non-operative management should always be
considered as the first option in adult and in the
pediatric populations. For this reason, clinical condition,
anatomical injury grade, and associated injuries should
be considered together in deciding the best treatment
option.
