Background: The bridge-to-bridge (BTB) strategy, a conversion to durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) after stabilization 
using surgical temporary mechanical circulatory supports for a couple of months, is not uncommon in Japan. However, its effect on 
clinical outcomes in comparison with a primary durable LVAD implantation strategy remains unknown.
Methods and Results: Data of 837 consecutive patients (median age 45, 73% males) who underwent durable LVAD implantation 
as BTB (n=168) or primary implant (n=669) between April 2011 and April 2019 were retrospectively reviewed from the prospective 
multicenter Japanese mechanically assisted circulatory support registry. The BTB group was younger and had comparable end-organ 
function, better hemodynamic profile, and longer operative time compared with the primary implant group at baseline. The 3-year 
survival was 80% vs. 87% (P=0.007) for the BTB and primary implant groups respectively, with greater observed rates of stroke and 
infection as the predominant causes of death. The BTB strategy was independently associated with increased 3-year mortality 
(hazard ratio 2.69 [1.43–5.07], P=0.002) in addition to other significant risk factors.
Conclusions: The BTB cohort had comparable baseline characteristics to the primary implant cohort at the time of durable LVAD 
conversion, but had lower 3-year survival. Detailed analysis clarifying the causality of this finding should improve outcomes with the 
BTB strategy.

BTB LVAD vs. Primary LVAD Implant 2199
mechanisms and baseline characteristics affecting the 
outcome differences between the 2 strategies need further 
investigation. Given that BTB should be an essential strategy, 
at least for some critically sick patients, such an analysis 
has great implications for establishing a more sophisticated 
BTB strategy.
In this study of J-MACS registry data, we compared 
baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes between the 
BTB and primary LVAD implant strategies to investigate 
the clinical implications of the BTB strategy.
Methods
Patient Selection
Using the J-MACS database,4 we collected data on consecu￾oxygenation (ECMO) systems with extracorporeal centrifu￾gal pumps have also become popular, especially in the 
presence of right ventricular dysfunction. This strategy 
that utilizes temporary mechanical support before durable 
LVAD is termed “bridge to bridge” (BTB).5
The BTB strategy might be promising, based on data 
from several small-center studies,6–8 but its survival benefit 
has not been demonstrated in large-scale studies. The 
recently published second report of the Japanese registry 
for Mechanical Assisted Circulatory Support (J-MACS) 
observed a relatively worse outcome of the BTB strategy 
compared with the primary LVAD implantation strategy.9
J-MACS is the Japanese counterpart of INTERMACS, 
and has collected all data of reimbursed durable LVADs 
in a nationwide and mandatory manner. To date, detailed

and warfarin targeted to established goals of international 
normalized ratio (INR) for each device. LVAD speed 
adjustments were made specific to the patient’s clinical 
condition.
Variables Evaluated
The latest data of baseline characteristics, and echocardio￾graphic, hemodynamic, and laboratory tests obtained 
within 1 month before durable LVAD implantation were 
collected in addition to demographic data. These data were 
also collected 1 month following durable LVAD implanta￾tion. The primary endpoint was all-cause death during the 
3-year study follow-up. Date of death and cause were 
collected. Dates of major adverse events, with definitions 
detailed in a prior publication,4 were also collected.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics 23 
(SPSS Inc., Armonk, IL, USA). Two-sided P values <0.05 
were considered significant. Continuous variables are 
expressed as median and interquartile and compared 
between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical 
variables are expressed as numbers and percentages and 
tive patients who underwent durable LVAD implantation 
as BTB (i.e., secondary device) or the primary device at 49 
Japanese institutions between April 2011 and April 2019. 
Because current Japanese insurance policy only allows 
durable LVAD implantation in patients who are already 
listed or being listed on the Japanese Organ Transplant 
registry, all participants were under a bridge-to-transplant 
strategy. All participants provided informed consent at 
each institute before LVAD implantation. The use of the 
J-MACS registry was approved beforehand (reference no. 
1902, April 9, 2019 by J-MACS Committee).
Follow-up Protocol
In the BTB group, patients were bridged from paracorpo￾real LVAD or extracorporeal centrifugal pump as LVAD 
or central ECMO (first devices; called surgical temporary 
mechanical circulatory support [MCS]) to durable LVADs 
(second devices). We defined the day of the device bridge 
as day 0. In the same manner, the day of durable LVAD 
implantation was defined as day 0 in the primary implant 
group.
Patients were managed according to established standard 
of care guidelines,10 including appropriate dosing of aspirin

BTB LVAD vs. Primary LVAD Implant 2201
1-Month Outcomes
At 1 month following durable LVAD implantation, the 
BTB group overall had smaller left ventricular dimensions 
with less mitral regurgitation (P<0.05 for both; Table 3). 
End-organ function was comparable between groups. Right 
atrial pressure was significantly higher in the BTB group 
(P=0.015).
3-Year Outcomes
During the 3-year observational period, the most predomi￾nant adverse events observed were stroke and infection 
compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test.
The primary endpoint was all-cause death at 3 years 
following durable LVAD implantation. Kaplan-Meier 
analyses were performed to assess the 3-year survival, which 
was stratified and compared between the BTB and primary 
implant strategies using a log-rank test. Cox proportional 
hazard ratio regression analyses were performed to inves￾tigate the effect of individual baseline characteristics, 
including BTB strategy vs. primary implant strategy, on 
3-year mortality. Variables significant in the univariable 
analyses were enrolled in the multivariable analyses with a 
step-wise method.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Among a total of 837 patients registered in J-MACS,4 168 
patients underwent durable LVAD implantation as BTB, 
and 669 patients as a primary implant (Table 1). Median 
age was 45 years old and 27% were female.
BTB patients were younger, more likely to have ischemic 
cardiomyopathy and comparable baseline end-organ 
function to the primary implant patients. BTB patients also 
had more optimized hemodynamics under the pre-implant 
surgical temporary MCS support compared with the primary 
implant group. Prothrombin time with INR measured at 
1, 3, 6, and 12 months following LVAD implantation did 
not significantly differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05 for 
all; Supplementary Table).
Perioperative Data
Both total operative time and cardiopulmonary bypass 
time were significantly longer in the BTB group compared 
with the primary implant group (P<0.05 for both; Table 2). 
Both the volume of perioperative blood transfusion and 
the duration of the index hospitalization were greater in 
the BTB group compared with the primary implant group 
(P<0.05 for both).

function to a level comparable to that of the primary 
implant cohort.
Survival Comparison
Despite comparable background characteristics, the BTB 
cohort had an observed 10% lower survival at 3 years 
compared with the primary implant cohort following durable 
LVAD support. The BTB strategy was independently 
associated with increased risk of death in addition to 
other conventional risk factors including age, smaller body 
size, hypoalbuminemia, and renal impairment.11–13 The 
predominant causes of death were stroke and infection in 
both cohorts.
As reported previously, the incidence of pump infection, 
probably due to more complex and longer surgery, would 
be higher in the BTB cohort than in the primary implant 
cohort, given the presence of pre-implanted surgical 
temporary MCS.9 Such device-related infection might 
increase the risk of systemic infection, which is known to 
subsequently dramatically increase the risk of stroke 
following LVAD implant.14 Consistently, most of the fatal 
strokes occurred within 1 year following the bridge (168 
days on median). Central venous pressure at postoperative 
1month was higher in the BTB cohort, probably due to 
longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and more blood 
transfusions.15 Of note, a longer operation time was an 
independent risk factor of death following durable LVAD 
implantation. Subclinical right heart failure in the BTB 
cohort might stimulate chronic inflammation and thus 
increase the risk of stroke.16 Prior temporary MCS in the 
BTB cohort might lead to acquired von Willebrand disease, 
which increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.17,18
Future Directions
Despite our findings, the BTB strategy still fills an unmet 
need, given that this is the only strategy to rescue 
INTERMACS profile 1 patients, who cannot be listed for 
heart transplantation immediately.9 Even when destination 
therapy is approved in Japan, direct implantation of durable 
LVADs in patients with INTERMACS profile 1 is chal￾lenging, given its poor postoperative prognosis.1 Severe 
donor shortage in Japan makes the waiting period extremely 
long (>4 years) and the Japanese organ donation system 
does not allocate sicker patients in a fast-track listing. 
Therefore, we cannot help but implant durable LVADs in 
those who are listed for transplant after stabilization by 
temporary MCS to keep them hemodynamically safe and 
maintain a better quality of life during the long waiting 
period.
We believe that the BTB should remain an essential 
strategy in Japan, and that it has acceptable clinical 
outcomes considering the crash-and-burn starting line. 
Currently, we only apply the BTB strategy for patients who 
have potential eligibility for transplant. On the other hand, 
the BTB strategy for those who carry a non-modifiable 
ineligibility for transplant (e.g., age ≥65 years) might require 
further discussion. The innovation of more sophisticated 
surgical techniques that minimize operative time, infection 
risk, and blood transfusions might make the prognosis of 
the BTB strategy better, and thus it could be expanded to 
destination therapy.
Optimal timing of the BTB surgery and appropriate 
patient selection might also improve survival. Long-term 
MCS support increases the risk of post-bridge device-related 
infection and associated deaths. However, optimization of 
(Figure 1). There were no statistically significant differences 
in the incidence of these major adverse events between the 
BTB and primary implant groups (P>0.05 for all).
In total, 97 patients died during the 3-year observational 
period (28 BTB and 69 primary implants); 3-year survival 
was significantly lower in the BTB group compared with the 
primary implant group (80% vs. 87%, P=0.007; Figure 2). 
In the BTB group, the most common adjudicated cause of 
death was stroke (61%) followed by infection (14%) and 
right ventricular failure (10%). Of note, fatal strokes 
developed at 168 (42, 245) days following the bridge. In the 
primary implant group, the prevalence of stroke was 38%, 
followed by infection (19%) and other various comorbidities 
as causes of death (Figure 3).
Predictors of 3-Year Mortality
Univariable and multivariable analyses demonstrated that 
the BTB strategy was an independent predictor of 3-year 
mortality (hazard ratio 2.69 [1.43–5.07], P=0.002). Other 
predictors, including older age, lower body surface area, 
lower albumin, and higher creatinine levels, were also 
associated with an increased risk of death (P<0.05 for all; 
Table 4).
Among the perioperative variables, the operation time 
per 60min was independently associated with the 3-year 
mortality following durable LVAD implantation with an 
adjusted hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% confidence interval 
1.07–1.21, P<0.001).
Discussion
We compared the perioperative characteristics between a 
BTB cohort (bridged from surgical temporary MCS to 
durable LVAD) and a primary implant cohort using data 
from a prospective multicenter J-MACS registry.4 The 
major findings were as follows. (1) Among all durable 
LVADs implanted in Japan, 20% were implanted as BTB. 
(2) The BTB cohort was younger and more often had isch￾emic cardiomyopathy, as well as more optimized baseline 
hemodynamics at the time of durable LVAD implantation. 
(3) Baseline end-organ function was comparable between 
the cohorts at the time of durable LVAD implantation. (4) 
The BTB cohort had longer operative time and required 
more postoperative blood transfusions. (5) The 3-year 
survival was lower in the BTB cohort predominantly 
because of a higher incidence of fatal stroke. (6) The BTB 
strategy was an independent risk factor for 3-year mortality.
Background Comparison
This is the first published report comparing baseline char￾acteristics between BTB and primary implant cohorts 
undergoing durable LVAD implantation. It is reasonable 
to assume that BTB patients would more often have, 
ischemic heart disease given that the most common etiology 
of acute cardiogenic shock is acute coronary syndrome. 
The BTB cohort was younger than the primary implant 
cohort, possibly because older patients might have died, 
or end-organ functional recovery might have not been 
sufficient for heart transplantation listing following surgical 
temporary MCS implant.
Most BTB patients had an INTERMACS profile 1, but 
a small portion had profile 2 before the first surgery, 
although durable LVAD implantation was performed on 
condition that the first MCS therapy successfully restored 
hemodynamics resulting in normalization of end-organ

end-organ function and hemodynamics for successful bridge 
therapy would require a certain period of temporary MCS 
support. Reducing infection at the cannulation site of the 
temporary support device is a critically important issue for 
minimizing surgical complexity and suppressing the 
occurrence of postoperative infection. We should also 
consider a better way to cardiac reverse remodeling as a 
means for potential explantation of temporary MCS before 
bridging to a durable LVAD.19
Study Limitations
Given the nature of multicenter large-scale registries, we 
could not specify some important data elements, including 
the types of stroke and infections. Given the major purpose 
of the J-MACS registry is to collect data on durable 
LVADs, detailed data of temporary MCS were lacking. 
The detailed causality between the BTB strategy and death 
from fatal stroke or infection needs further investigation. 
Further analyses using blood biomarkers are warranted. 
The device type, including surgical temporary MCS and 
durable LVADs, might also have an effect on the outcome. 
We did not perform subanalyses of each device given the 
small subgroup numbers. Less invasive percutaneous 
LVADs could be used as a bridging tool to durable LVAD 
in the near future, although such a percutaneous bridge 
strategy is not defined as BTB. Clinical outcomes of such 
a strategy would be another future concern.
Conclusions
The BTB cohort had comparable baseline characteristics 
to the primary implant cohort at the time of durable 
LVAD implantation, but had lower 3-year survival. Further 
detailed analyses clarifying the causality of this finding 
may improve outcomes with the BTB strategy.
