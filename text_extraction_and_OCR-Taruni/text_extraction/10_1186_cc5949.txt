Abstract
Introduction There is limited information on whether the
incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients has
changed over time and there is controversy on whether its
outcome has improved.
Methods We interrogated the Australian New Zealand Intensive
Care Society Adult Patient Database to obtain data on all adult
admissions to 20 Australian intensive care units (ICUs) for ≥ 24
hours from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2005. Trends in
incidence and mortality for ICU admissions associated with early
AKI were assessed.
Results There were 91,254 patient admissions to the 20 study
ICUs, with 4,754 cases of AKI, for an estimated crude
cumulative incidence of 5.2% (95% confidence interval, 5.1 to
5.4). The incidence of AKI increased during the study period,
with an estimated annual increment of 2.8% (95% confidence
interval, 1.0 to 5.6, P = 0.04). The crude hospital mortality was
significantly higher for patients with AKI than those without
(42.7% versus 13.4%; odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval,
4.5 to 5.1; P < 0.0001). There was also a decrease in AKI crude
mortality (annual percentage change, -3.4%; 95% confidence
interval, -4.7 to -2.12; P < 0.001), however, which was not seen
in patients without AKI. After covariate adjustment, AKI
remained associated with a higher mortality (odds ratio, 1.23;
95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.32; P < 0.001) and there
was a declining trend in the odds ratio for hospital mortality.
Conclusion Over the past decade, in a large cohort of critically
ill patients admitted to 20 Australian ICUs, there has been a
significant rise in the incidence of early AKI while the mortality
associated with AKI has declined.
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem in criti￾cally ill patients and typically portends an increase in morbidity
and mortality [1]. Multiple epidemiologic investigations have
provided a broad range of estimates of the incidence of AKI in
critically ill patients [2-9]. Likewise, numerous studies have
shown that AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated
with high short-term and long-term case fatality rates, with dial￾ysis dependence, with reduced quality of life and with excess
utilization of health resources [2-6,9-20].
Regrettably, many of these studies suffer from limited general￾izability as a result of disparities in the study methodology, the
study population and the definitions of AKI. Moreover, no study
has purposely evaluated or been capable of assessing trends
in the incidence and outcome of AKI in critically ill patients over
time, once changes in illness severity have been taken into
account [21]. Accordingly, there is limited information on
whether the incidence of AKI in the ICU has changed signifi￾cantly over time and there is considerable controversy on
whether its outcome has improved [22,23]. On the other hand,
the Australian New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS)
Adult Patient Database (APD) is a high-quality clinical
AKI = acute kidney injury; ANZICS = Australia New Zealand Intensive Care Society; APACHE = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; 
APD = Adult Patient Database; CI = confidence interval; ICU = intensive care unit; OR = odds ratio.

database containing data from > 600,000 individual adult
admissions to 135 ICUs from 1987 to the present that now
captures approximately > 80% of all admissions to ICUs in
Australia and New Zealand [24]. Twenty of these units have
contributed data for a decade, making it possible to assess
changes in incidence and outcome over a significant
timespan.
We therefore interrogated the ANZICS APD to obtain informa￾tion on the incidence and outcome of AKI in a cohort of criti￾cally ill patients from 20 Australian hospitals over a decade.
We sought to describe the 10-year trend in the incidence of
AKI at the time of or within 24 hours of admission to ICU, and
the 10-year trend in the crude and adjusted hospital mortality
rates associated with AKI.
Methods
We conducted an observational surveillance cohort study to
determine the incidence of and outcomes associated with AKI.
We interrogated the ANZICS APD for all adult (age ≥ 18
years) ICU admissions for ≥ 24 hours with a diagnosis of AKI
during the period from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2005.
In the event of multiple admissions for a particular patient, only
the initial ICU admission was considered. Those patients read￾mitted to the ICU within 72 hours after their initial discharge
were considered part of the index admission. We selected
only those Australian ICUs that had continuously contributed
data to the APD during this 10-year period. This cohort
included 20 ICUs (nine tertiary referral centres, six metropoli￾tan hospitals, four peripheral regional/rural hospitals and one
private hospital).
Identification of cases
We used two strategies to identify all ICU admissions associ￾ated with AKI. First, the APD has a prespecified data element
for the presence of AKI [25]. For this data element, AKI was
defined as an acute serum creatinine level ≥ 133 μmol/l or a
24-hour urine output < 410 ml and not having received prior
renal replacement therapy. In addition, the APD verifies and
validates any patient designated with AKI and a serum creati￾nine level < 200 μmol/l. Second, we evaluated the Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III diag￾nostic codes for AKI in order to identify any additional patients.
To further corroborate admissions with AKI, all identified
patients were then referenced with APACHE II and APACHE
III diagnostic codes for chronic renal replacement therapy and/
or kidney transplant.
Data collection
Standard demographic, clinical and physiologic data were
retrieved. Demographic information included age, sex, dates of
admission to the hospital and the ICU, and source of admis￾sion. Clinical data encompassed the primary diagnosis, surgi￾cal status, the presence of selected comorbid illnesses and a
need for mechanical ventilation. Data on kidney function
extracted included the peak serum creatinine and urea, and
the total 24-hour urine output within the first 24 hours of ICU
admission [25]. Severity of illness during the first 24 hours of
ICU admission was assessed using the APACHE II, APACHE
III and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scoring systems
[26,27].
Pre-existing comorbid illnesses were defined using the
chronic health evaluation for the APACHE II, APACHE III and
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scoring systems, as out￾lined in the ANZICS APD data dictionary [25].
Several primary admission diagnostic categories were created
[25]. Sepsis/septic shock encompassed admissions for pri￾marily sepsis-related diagnoses, and included sepsis associ￾ated with pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, urinary tract
infections, central nervous system infections, soft tissue infec￾tions, and the ANZICS APD-specific diagnostic code addi￾tions for sepsis with shock of undetermined source. A primary
cardiac diagnosis encompassed nonsurgical admissions with
cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure and
acute myocardial infarction. A primary hepatic diagnosis
included admission with hepatic failure or liver transplant. A
diagnosis of gastrointestinal haemorrhage included bleeding
due to peptic ulcers, diverticulosis and varices. A metabolic/
poisoning diagnosis incorporated nonoperative causes of
metabolic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, drug overdoses or
other endocrinopathies. A primary respiratory diagnosis
encompassed primary respiratory arrests, aspiration syn￾drome, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, exacerbations of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and pulmo￾nary embolism. A primary neurologic diagnosis incorporated
stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemor￾rhage, epidural haematoma or other neurologic cause for
coma.
Clinical outcomes
Outcomes extracted from the APD included an incidence of
early AKI at or within 24 hours of ICU admission (as a propor￾tion of all ICU admissions) and the hospital mortality rate. If
patients were readmitted to the ICU prior to hospital dis￾charge, subsequent ICU admissions were not included in the
analysis of mortality. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay and
the hospital discharge location were also evaluated.
Statistical analysis
Analysis was performed using Stata version 8.2 (Stata Corp,
College Station, TX, USA). In the event of missing data values,
data were not replaced or estimated. Normally or near-nor￾mally distributed variables are reported as means with stand￾ard deviations and were compared by Student's t test. Non￾normally distributed continuous data are reported as medians
with interquartile ranges and were compared by the Mann–
Whitney U test. Categorical data are reported as proportions
and were compared using Fisher's exact test.

Incidence estimates for early AKI on admission to the ICU
were calculated as a proportion of all admissions to the ICU
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Incidence estimates are
presented as cumulative over 10 years, as time-stratified by 2-
year intervals and as stratified by demographics, baseline
characteristics and primary diagnosis. To determine changes
over time, parametric and nonparametric tests for trend were
performed as appropriate.
The estimated annual percentage changes in the incidence of
AKI were determined by fitting a straight-line regression of the
natural logarithm of the rates, with the calendar year used as
an independent variable. The estimated annual percentage
change was equal to [100 × (exp(b) - 1)], where b represents
the slope of the regression. If the estimated annual percentage
change is statistically greater than zero, then the incidence
rate has an increasing trend over the study period [28].
Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for the association
of AKI at ICU admission with hospital mortality. The variables
age, sex, comorbidity, surgical/medical admission, primary
diagnosis, severity of illness (APACHE II score), mechanical
ventilation and hospital site were included. Model fit was
assessed by the goodness-of-fit test and discrimination was
assessed by the area under the receiver operator characteris￾tic curve. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for
all comparisons.
Results
During the 10-year study period, 91,254 patients were admit￾ted to the 20 study ICUs. Overall, these patients had a median
(interquartile range) age of 64.1 (49 to 74.1) years, 60.6%
were male, 21.5% had evidence of comorbid disease, 50.4%
were medical admissions and the initial mean (± standard
deviation) APACHE II score was 16.4 (± 7.8).
Incidence
In total, 4,754 patients had a diagnosis of AKI at the time of or
during the first 24 hours after ICU admission. This translated
into an estimated crude cumulative incidence of 5.2% (95%
CI, 5.1 to 5.4). The range in incidence was 4.6 to 6.9%. There
was a significant increasing trend in incidence over the study
period, with an estimated annual percentage increment of
2.8% (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.6; P = 0.04) (Figure 1). The incidence
was significantly greater for admissions in 2001–2005 com￾pared with admissions during 1996–2000 (5.6% versus
4.8%; OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.23; P < 0.0001); this dif￾ference persisted after taking into account the apparent high
6.9% incidence in 2003 (5.2% versus 4.8%; OR, 1.10; 95%
CI, 1.03 to 1.16; P = 003).
Demographics
Older patient age was associated with a higher incidence of
AKI (Table 1). There were no significant changes in incidence
of AKI stratified by age. There was, however, a nonsignificant
increase in incidence for patients aged ≥ 75 years (annual per￾centage change, 2.0%; 95% CI, -0.5 to 4.6; P = 0.1). There
was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence strat￾ified by sex (5.1% for males versus 5.4% for females; OR,
0.96; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.01; P = 0.12) or evidence for a
change over the study period (Table 1).
Patient characteristics
The incidence of AKI was considerably higher when stratified
by both the presence of pre-existing comorbid illness and by
specific comorbid illnesses (Table 1). There was a nonsignifi￾cant trend for an increase in the incidence of AKI for patients
with no comorbid illness (annual percentage change, 2.9%;
95% CI, -0.4 to 6.2; P = 0.08). There were no significant

changes, however, in incidence stratified by the number of
comorbid diseases. For the specific comorbid diseases evalu￾ated, all were associated with a significantly higher incidence
AKI. In particular, comorbid liver disease (OR, 2.58; 95% CI,
2.24 to 2.98; P < 0.0001) and haematologic malignancy (OR,
2.18; 95% CI, 1.82 to 2.61; P < 0.0001) showed the highest
risk. During the study period, only haematologic malignancy
showed a significant change in incidence of AKI, characterized
by a decreasing trend (annual percentage change, -65%;
95% CI, -86 to -12; P = 0.03).
Nonelective admissions compared with elective admissions
were associated with a higher incidence of AKI (7.2% versus
1.7%; OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 4.20 to 5.04; P < 0.0001) (Table 2).
Over the study period, there was a nonsignificant but increas￾ing trend in the incidence of AKI for elective ICU admissions
(annual percentage change, 6.4%; 95% CI, -1.2 to 14.6; P =
0.09). There was no change for nonelective admissions,
however.
Medical admissions compared with primarily surgical admis￾sions were associated with a higher incidence of AKI (8.3%
versus 2.1%; OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 3.82 to 4.42; P < 0.0001)
(Table 2). There was a nonsignificant decreasing trend in the
incidence of AKI associated with cardiovascular surgery
(annual percentage change, -4%; 95% CI, -8.9 to 12; P = 0.1)
and a significant decrease in the incidence of AKI associated
with trauma (annual percentage change, -8%; 95% CI, -13 to
-2.3; P = 0.009) over the study period.
Several admission diagnoses were associated with an
increased incidence of AKI (Table 2). There were no signifi￾cant changes in incidence by diagnostic category over the
study period, with the exception of an increasing trend in inci￾dence of AKI associated with metabolic/poisoning diagnoses
(annual percentage change, 5.5%; 95% CI, 0.6–10.7; P =
0.03).

Details of kidney function and severity of illness scores for the
first 24 hours after ICU admission for patients with AKI are pre￾sented in Table 3.
Mortality
The crude hospital mortality was significantly higher for
patients with AKI than those without (42.7% versus 13.4%;
OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 4.5 to 5.1; P < 0.0001) (Table 4 and Figure
2). There was, however, a significant decrease over time in the
crude mortality rate associated with AKI (annual percentage
change, -3.4%; 95% CI, -4.7 to -2.12; P < 0.001). There was
no change for those without AKI over the study period. The
presence of AKI remained associated with higher mortality
after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, surgical/medical
admission, primary diagnosis, severity of illness (APACHE II
score), mechanical ventilation and hospital site (OR, 1.39;
95% CI, 1.3 to 1.5; P < 0.001). Over the study period, there
was a trend for decreasing ORs for death associated with AKI.
Additional clinical outcomes
Those patients with AKI had a longer median (interquartile
range) stay in both the ICU and the hospital than those without
AKI (Table 5). Specifically, AKI increased both the duration of
the ICU stay (4.4 (2.1–9.5) days for AKI versus 2.6 (1.7 to 4.9)
days for no AKI, P < 0.0001) and of the hospital stay (14.2
(6.5 to 28.9) days for AKI versus 11.7 (7.0 to 21.9) days for
no AKI, P < 0.0001). The total duration of stay was also signif￾icantly longer in survivors to hospital discharge stratified by
AKI than in nonsurvivors (19.8 (10.8 to 37.2) days versus 11.9
(7.2 to 21.9) days, P < 0.0001). There were no significant
changes in ICU or hospital lengths of stay over the study
period.
The hospital discharge location was significantly different for
patients with AKI compared with those patients with no AKI
(Table 5). Fewer patients with AKI were discharged home than
patients without AKI (74.8% versus 84.8%, P < 0.001);
instead, AKI patients were more likely to have been transferred
to another acute care hospital (16.6% versus 9.6%, P <
0.001) or a rehabilitation facility (8.6% versus 5.5%, P <
0.001). There were no significant changes in hospital dis￾charge location over the study period.
Discussion
We conducted a 10-year observational study of > 90,000 ICU
admissions to 20 ICUs in Australia, using a high-quality clinical
database, to evaluate trends in the incidence and mortality
associated with AKI. We found that approximately 5.2% of
critically ill patients are diagnosed with AKI at the time of ICU
admission and that the incidence of AKI has increased

significantly over the past decade. We also found that the inci￾dence of AKI associated with admission for metabolic diag￾noses and/or poisonings has increased but that the incidence
has declined in those patients admitted with trauma or haema￾tologic malignancies. We confirmed that the mortality rate
associated with AKI remains high and that the increased risk
of death associated with AKI persisted after adjustment for
several relevant covariates. Finally, we found that, despite an
increasing incidence, the multivariate adjusted odds of death
associated with AKI have shown a declining trend over the 10-
year study period.
Numerous epidemiologic investigations have estimated the
occurrence and associated burden of AKI on clinical out￾comes and health resources in critically ill patients [1-
5,7,8,11,12,15,19,29]. Very few studies, however, have
assessed whether the incidence or outcomes associated with
AKI have changed over time [21,30,31]. Moreover, these stud￾ies are often limited to a single centre and compare two dis￾crete periods in time separated by several years [21]. Two
recent large epidemiologic investigations using administrative
databases showed similar patterns of increasing incidence
and decreasing mortality with AKI; however, these studies are
limited by focusing on all hospitalized patients rather than on
only those admitted to ICU. Overall, this paucity of data exam￾ining for trends in incidence over time is unfortunate when tak￾ing into account the poor clinical outcome and high cost of
care for critically ill patients with AKI [10,13,32].
The key findings from our study, specifically that AKI is com￾mon and its occurrence is on the rise, may have important
health resource and economic implications. For instance, our
data support the findings of prior investigations showing that
AKI may play a role in prolonging the duration of stay in the ICU
and the hospital and may lead to higher rates of hospital dis￾charge to long-term care or rehabilitation facilities [2,11]. One
consequence of these differences in clinical outcomes would
undoubtedly be the consumption of considerable health
resources [10,13,33,34].

Additionally, there has been considerable controversy as to
whether the clinical outcomes – in particular, mortality associ￾ated with AKI – have improved [22,23]. For example, Ympa
and colleagues reported in a systematic review that mortality
associated with AKI has shown no consistent change over
several decades [23]. Regrettably, their study was highly
prone to bias and was limited by only reporting crude mortality
rates across those studies included and by the inability to
show equivalent illness severity. On the contrary, we have
found over the past decade that the mortality associated with
AKI, when adjusted for covariates, has shown a declining
trend. Whether this decline can be attributed to an improve￾ment in the overall care of critically ill patients or by specific
interventions or therapies aimed at those with AKI remains
unknown [35-38]. This decline in mortality has, however,
occurred despite reported changes to the clinical profile and
characteristics of critically ill patients with AKI [8,22]. Obser￾vational studies suggest that critically ill patients with AKI are
increasingly older, have more comorbid disease, are more
probably septic, and have greater severity of illness and organ
failure [2,6].
In our study, we evaluated for changes in the profile and char￾acteristics of patients that might have also corresponded to
changes in the incidence of AKI. We found no notable trends
when stratified by age or the presence of comorbid illness,
with the exception of a decline in AKI associated with haema￾tologic malignancy. Similarly, while ICU admissions for sepsis,
acute cardiac conditions and hepatic failure were all associ￾ated with a higher risk for AKI, there were no significant trends
in incidence for these conditions over the study period, with
the exception of a rise in AKI associated with admissions for
acute metabolic/poisoning conditions. Interestingly, however,
we found a declining trend in the incidence of AKI associated
with trauma. While the number of cases of AKI associated with
trauma in our study was relatively small, there are plausible

explanations for this finding – such as an increase in regional￾ized trauma systems [39,40], advancements in prehospital
care [41] and earlier identification of patients at high risk for
AKI, due to conditions such as rhabdomyolysis, with initiation
of timely prophylactic interventions [42,43].
There are both limitations and strengths to our study. First, the
definition of AKI used in our study, as mandated by the APD,
will invariably influence the overall incidence estimates. We
have, however, used several measures to capture patients
designated with acute reductions in kidney function consistent
with the syndrome of AKI. Second, we were unable to deter￾mine the precise prevalence of chronic kidney disease with the
exception of those patients requiring chronic renal replace￾ment therapy. This may also influence the overall incidence
estimates. To minimize misclassification, we have attempted to
exclude all patients with known end-stage renal disease or all
admissions to the ICU that were related to kidney transplanta￾tion. Reassuringly, our incidence estimates appear largely con￾sistent with the current literature [1]. Third, we were unable to
provide estimates of the proportion of patients requiring acute
renal replacement therapy. Fourth, we were only able to collect
data on patients within the first 24 hours of admission to the
ICU. The incidence estimates of AKI therefore probably under￾estimate the true burden of AKI as some patients would have
developed delayed AKI several days after admission [44].
Moreover, we are unable to assess long-term outcome or renal
recovery. On the other hand, this is by far the largest study of
AKI ever conducted in terms of the overall screened popula￾tion and target cohort, and the only study where outcomes and
illness severity could be studied in the same units over an
entire decade.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, we conducted the first large multicentre
study of AKI in critically ill patients to evaluate long-term trends
in incidence and mortality. In this heterogeneous cohort of crit￾ically ill patients, we found a significant rise in the incidence of
AKI. Moreover, despite modest changes in the profile of
patients with AKI, the associated mortality has declined.
