Abstract
A 2 year old boy developed recurrent pulmonary vein stenosis after
surgical repair of infradiaphragmatic pulmonary venous connection.
He had required implantation of stents in the left and right sided
pulmonary veins at 7 and 13 months of age, respectively. By 2 years
of age he had undergone three catheterisation procedures and two
surgical procedures to treat recurrent pulmonary vein stenosis. His
right ventricular pressure was suprasystemic and catheterisation
showed severe neointimal proliferation of both left and right sided
stents. At this time the stents were dilated by balloon with
simultaneous intrastent sonotherapy. Three months later the
patient’s clinical improvement was significant, his right ventricular
pressure had decreased, and Doppler velocity had decreased across
both left and right sided stents.
