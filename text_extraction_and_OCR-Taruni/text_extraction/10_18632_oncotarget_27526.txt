ABSTRACT
Pirfenidone is a pleiotropic molecule approved to treat idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF). Pirfenidone has demonstrated to downregulate transforming growth 
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) cellular effects. However, its anti-fibrotic mechanism remains 
unclear. Here, we aim to analyze the effects of pirfenidone on the TGF-β1 canonical and 
non-canonical pathways, as well as, on the most characteristic IPF cellular processes. 
Results observed in this work showed that TGF-β1-induced canonical SMAD3 and non￾canonical ERK1/2 phosphorylations were not inhibited by pirfenidone in alveolar A549 
and lung fibroblasts MRC5 cells. In contrast, pirfenidone inhibited TGF-β1-induced 
MUC1-CT Thr41 (1224) and Tyr46 (1229) phosphorylations, thus reducing the β-catenin 
activation. Additionally, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies in ATII 
cells and lung fibroblasts showed that pirfenidone inhibited the formation and nuclear 
translocation of the transcriptional fibrotic TGF-β1-induced phospho-SMAD3/MUC1-
CT/active-β-catenin complex, and consequently the SMAD-binding element activation 
(SBE). This study provided also evidence of the inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on 
the TGF-β1-induced ATII to mesenchymal and fibroblast to myofibroblast transitions, 
fibroblast proliferation and ATII and fibroblast senescence. Therefore, it indicates that 
pirfenidone’s inhibitory effect on TGF-β1-induced fibrotic cellular processes is mediated 
by the inhibition of MUC1-CT phosphorylation, β-catenin activation, nuclear complex 
formation of phospho-SMAD3/MUC1-CT/active β-catenin and SBE activation, which 
may be of value to further develop anti-fibrotic IPF therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating 
disease characterized by extensive accumulation of 
abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) in the lung and 
variable progression among patients, leading to death 
3-5 years after diagnosis [1]. IPF is currently seen as the 
consequence of an unresolved wound healing [2], which 
is mediated by several pro-fibrotic factors and leads to an 
uncontrolled proliferation of myofibroblasts, responsible 
for the abnormal ECM production. Myofibroblasts are 
key cells of the fibrotic disease and they are characterized 
by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) 
and migration capacities [3]. Invasive myofibroblasts in 
IPF lungs have multiple origins [4] including lung resident 
fibroblasts or mesenchymal/myofibroblast transformations 
of alveolar type II epithelial cells (ATII) [5]. Furthermore, 
both type of cells, fibroblasts and ATII cells, acquire 
senescent identities, which are able to promote lung 
fibrosis [6, 7].

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is probably 
the most potent pro-fibrotic factor [8]. This cytokine is 
known to promote fibroblasts differentiation and ECM 
production [9], leading to pulmonary fibrosis mainly 
through the SMAD-dependent canonical pathway [10]. 
Nevertheless, TGF-β1 also propagates its signalling by the 
SMAD-independent non-canonical pathway, through other 
factors such as, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 
MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), β-catenin, 
AKT (also known as protein kinase B), extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and JUN N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) among others [8]. Indeed, aberrant activity 
of the developmental Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway 
has also emerged recently as a fundamental concept in 
fibrogenesis [11, 12].
Transmembrane mucin 1 (MUC1) is a large 
glycoprotein that acts as a membrane receptor. It is 
comprised of a extracellular tandem repeat domain, a 
transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic 
tail (CT), which contains several potential and putative 
tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation sites [13]. 
MUC1 extracellular domain contains the KL6 epitope 
domain, which can be shed into the lumen by proteolytic 
cleavage [14] and it has been observed increased in 
serum, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and 
lung tissue of IPF patients [13], serving as a potential 
biomarker in IPF disease [15]. Otherwise, the highly 
conserved CT of MUC1 modulates multiple intracellular 
signals [16] by phosphorylation, bioactivation and 
interaction with several proteins implicated in different 
carcinogenic processes linked to IPF disease [17, 18]. 
In this context, we found recently that the expression 
of MUC1-CT and its phosphorylated forms at Thr41 and 
Tyr46 were increased in lung tissue from IPF patients. 
We also observed that TGF-β1, through SMAD3 
phosphorylation, increased the intracellular bioactivation 
of MUC1-CT, thus increasing the expression of the 
active β-catenin to form a nuclear complex of phospho￾SMAD3/MUC1-CT and MUC1-CT/β-catenin, promoting 
the development of fibrotic processes such as ATII and 
fibroblast to myofibroblast transitions, as well as, cell 
senescence and fibroblast proliferation [19].
Currently, therapeutic option to treat IPF is still 
limited. Indeed, pirfenidone, which has been recently 
approved as IPF therapy [20], demonstrates only a 
reduction of the loss of lung function, but is not able to 
reverse IPF progression. Pirfenidone, is a pleiotropic 
molecule that has anti-oxidant, anti-fibrotic and anti￾inflammatory properties as shown in several in vitro and 
in vivo studies [21, 22]. As an anti-fibrotic therapy, it 
has been demonstrated that pirfenidone inhibits TGF-β￾induced cellular processes, collagen synthesis, fibroblast 
proliferation and ATII fibrotic gene expression, as well 
as, mediates tissue repair [23–27]. However, the exact 
mechanisms through which pirfenidone offers protection 
against lung fibrosis remains unclear.
In this study, we analysed in vitro the anti-fibrotic 
mechanism of pirfenidone on the TGF-β1 canonical 
and non-canonical pathways as well as on the effects of 
cellular tranformations such as ATII and fibroblast to 
myfibroblast transitions, cell senescence and fibroblast 
proliferation.
RESULTS
Pirfenidone suppresses TGF-β1 non-canonical 
β-catenin activation but not non-canonical 
ERK1/2 and canonical SMAD3 phosphorylation
The canonical SMAD3 phosphorylation was 
increased in A549 cells by TGF-β1 action (Figure 1A). 
Pirfenidone did not prevent this SMAD3 phosphorylation 
(Figure 1A). Similar results were observed in MRC5 lung 
fibroblast cell line (Figure 1B) in which pirfenidone did 
not prevent the TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation.
The non-canonical β-catenin activation pathway was 
also increased in A549 and MRC5 cells by TGF-β1 action 
(Figure 1A) and inhibited by pirfenidone (Figure 1A, 1B). 
The non-canonical ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway 
was also increased in A549 and MRC5 cells by TGF-β1 
action, although similarly to SMAD3 phosphorylation, 
pirfenidone did not prevent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 
both types of cells (Figure 1A, 1B).
Pirfenidone inhibits TGF-β1-induced MUC1-CT 
bioactivation
TGF-β1 significantly increased the MUC1-CT 
phosphorylation at the 1224 threonine and 1229 tyrosine 
amino acid positions after 40 min of stimulation in A549 
(Figure 2A) and MRC5 cells (Figure 2C). In contrast, in 
cells incubated with pirfenidone, TGF-β1 was not able to 
induce these MUC1-CT phosphorylations. Similar results 
were observed in primary ATII cells (Figure 2B) and 
primary lung fibroblasts (Figure 2D). TGF-β1-induced 
MUC1-CT phosphorylations at the 1224 threonine and 1229 
tyrosine amino acid positions were inhibited by pirfenidone.
Pirfenidone inhibits the TGF-β1-induced 
phospho-Smad3/MUC1-CT and MUC1-CT/
active-β-catenin nuclear protein complex and 
Smad-binding element activation
In ATII cells, TGF-β1 stimulus promoted the 
formation of protein complexes including phospho￾SMAD3/MUC1-CT and active (act)-β-catenin/MUC1-
CT as showed the immunoprecipitations (Figure 3A, 3B, 
3C) and confocal microscopy studies (Figure 3D, 3E). 
In A549 cells, TGF-β1 induced Smad-binding element 
(SBE) activation, which was attenuated by pirfenidone 
pretreatment (Figure 3F). Therefore, it confirms that 
preincubation with pirfenidone has little effect on the 

www.oncotarget.com 1308 Oncotarget
TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of SMAD3, but 
abrogates the TGF-β1-induced nuclear localization of 
SMAD3. TGF-β1 stimulus also promoted the nuclear 
protein complexes of phospho-SMAD3/MUC1-CT and 
act-β-catenin/MUC1-CT in primary lung fibroblast from 
IPF patients, as showed by immunoprecipitation (Figure 
4A–4C) and con-focal immunofluorescence (Figure 
4D, 4E). Pirfenidone prevented the formation of these 
protein complexes, as well as, the nuclear localization of 
them in IPF primary lung fibroblasts.
Pirfenidone inhibits the TGF-β1-induced 
alveolar type II epithelial to mesenchymal and 
fibroblast to myofibroblast transitions
TGF-β1 promoted the ATII to mesenchymal 
transition in primary cells (Figure 5A) and the 
bronchoalveolar cell line A549 (Figure 5B, 5C), 
increasing the protein and gene expression of the 
canonical TGF-β1 mesenchymal markers α-SMA, 
collagen type I, SNAI2 and SNAIL, and decreasing 
the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin 
after 72 h of stimulation. Pirfenidone inhibited ATII to 
mesenchymal transition since pirfenidone inhibited the 
canonical TGF-β1-induced expression of mesenchymal 
markers, as well as, the TGF-β1-induced decrease of 
E-cadherin expression. Similar results were observed 
in primary lung fibroblasts (Figure 6A) and MRC5 
lung fibroblast cell line (Figure 6B, 6C). TGF-β1 
induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transition (Figure 
6A–6C), which was inhibited by pirfenidone treatment. 
Nevertheless, pirfenidone’s inhibitory action of 
pirfenidone on TGF-β1-induced transition of primary 
fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was not reported as 
statistically significant, which is just probably due to the 
small pirfenidone concentrations used in this study.

Pirfenidone attenuates the TGF-β1-induced ATII 
and lung fibroblast senescence and the TGF-β1-
induced lung fibroblast proliferation
TGF-β1 has demonstrated to promote cell 
senescence in ATII cells and lung fibroblasts, as well as, 
to induce cell proliferation in lung fibroblasts [28–30]. In 
this context, we observed that TGF-β1 at a dose of 10 ng/
ml increased lung fibroblast proliferation during 48 h of 
stimulation (Figure 7A). At this point, lung fibroblasts 
showed increased β-galactosidase activity, thus indicating 
a change from active proliferative to senescent fibroblasts 
(Figure 7B, 7D). ATII cells also acquired secenescent 
phenotypes after 72 h of TGF-β1 stimulation at a dose of 
10 ng/ml (Figure 7C, 7E). Both phenoypes, proliferative 
and senescent, were inhibited by pirfenidone.
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated novel evidence of 
the inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on the recently reported 
intracellular bioactivation of MUC1-CT in IPF. It may be 
of value to understand the molecular mechanism of action 
of pirfenidone in IPF, as well as to further develop anti￾fibrotic IPF therapies.
Recently, we found that MUC1-CT was increased 
in lung tissue from IPF patients, but not in the lungs of 
healthy subjects, and located mostly in hyperplasic ATII 
cells and fibroblasts in fibrotic areas. We also found that 
canonical TGF-β1 induced SMAD3 phosphorylation 
bioactivated MUC1-CT by phosphorylation at Thr41 
(1224) and Tyr46 (1229), thus increasing the activation of 
β-catenin to form a nuclear complex of phospho-SMAD3/
MUC1-CT and MUC1-CT/β-catenin. This nuclear 
complex was suggested to activate the fibrotic processes 
of ATII and fibroblast to myofibroblast transitions, cell 
senescence and fibroblast proliferation through the SBE 
DNA activation [19] (Figure 8).
Pirfenidone and nintedanib are the two medications 
approved for the treatment of IPF. Nevertheless, these 
drugs demonstrate only limitation of the disease course, 
but they are not able to reverse IPF progression. The 
mechanism of action of nintedanib is currently well 
characterized, but the target of pirfenidone is still not 
well understood [31]. Pirfenidone has demonstrated to 
increase progression-free survival, to decrease the rate 
of forced vital capacity (FVC) decline, and to decrease 
acute exacerbations of IPF patients [32, 33]. Initially, 
pirfenidone was considered as an antioxidant therapy since 
it demonstrated O2
-
 scavenging activity [34, 35]. However, 
further studies demonstrated that pirfenidone has a number 
of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, including 
downregulation of fibrotic genes in ATII cells, inhibition 
of collagen synthesis, down-regulation of TGF-β1 cellular 
effects and reduction of fibroblast proliferation and 
fibrosis in bleomycin-induced animal models [22, 27]. 
This anti-fibrotic activity is exhibited not only in the lung, 
but further in kidney, hepatic, and cardiac fibrosis [22].
Currently, there are no potential data regarding 
the molecular mechanism of pirfenidone on the TGF-β1 
canonical and non-canonical pathways influencing IPF. 
In this work, we provided a potential mechanism that 
explain, almost in part, pirfenidone anti-fibrotic effects. 
Pirfenidone inhibited the TGFβ1-induced MUC1-CT 
Thr41 (1224) and Tyr46 (1229) phosphorylations, thus 
reducing the amount of active-β-catenin and the nuclear

translocation of the phospho-SMAD3/MUC1-CT/β￾catenin complex and SBE activation (Figure 8).
The major signalling pathway of TGF-β1 is 
through its TGF-β receptor 1 and 2, activating the 
cytoplasmic SMAD2 and 3, which act as transcriptional 
factors to regulate proliferation and fibrotic genes. In 
this study, we demonstrated that pirfenidone treatment 
at concentrations of 50µM (~9.2 µg/ml) reduced the 
TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 nuclear accumulation in ATII 
cells from healthy donors and primary lung fibroblasts 
from IPF patients, as well as, the SBE DNA activation in 
A549 cells. However, pirfenidone did not inhibit SMAD3 
phosphorylation in A549 and MRC5 cells. Different 
results were previously observed in primary human lung 
fibroblasts, in which pirfenidone reduced the TGF-β￾induced SMAD3 phosphorylation [36]. Nevertheless, 
SMAD3 phosphorylation was only inhibited by the most 
elevated concentration of pirfenidone (300 µg/ml), which 
is referred to as supratherapeuthic concentration since it 
is out of the range of pirfenidone’s serum concentrations 
(1.64 µg /ml (Cmin) - 14.7 µg/ml (Cmax)) following an oral 
daily dose of 2403 mg (food and drug administration 
(FDA) technical pirfenidone brochure). In contrast, 
Choi et al. also used supratherapeuthic concentrations 
of pirfenidone (500 µg/ml), but similarly to our results, 
pirfenidone did not inhibit the TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 
phosphorylation, but prevented the nuclear accumulation 
of SMAD3 in the human epithelial cell line ARPE-19 
[26]. Additionally, IPF patients treated with pirfenidone 
tended to have higher levels of p-SMAD than untreated 
controls [37]. TGF-β1 also propagates its signalling by 
other signalling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
or ERK1/2 signalling pathway. In this study, TGF-β1-
induced β-catenin activation was inhibited by pirfenidone 
action in A549 and MRC5 cells. Furthermore, we recently 
found that the TGF-β1-induced active form of β-catenin 
was inhibited in siRNA-MUC1 A549 and MRC5 cells, 
thus suggesting that Thr41 (1224) and Tyr46 (1229) MUC1-

CT phosphorylations are needed to increase active-β￾catenin in ATII cells and lung fibroblasts from IPF patients 
[19]. Therefore, we suggest that pirfenidone inhibits 
TGF-β1-induced β-catenin activation through inhibition 
of the MUC1-CT intracellular bioactivation. However, 
we have not elucidated if pirfenidone has also inhibitory 
action on Wnt-induced β-catenin activation, although we 
could hypothesize it since it was previously reported by 
other authors [38]. In contrast, we observed that TGF-β1-
induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not inhibited by 
pirfenidone. Differently, pirfenidone was able to inhibit 
the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 
kinase signalling in the TGF-β1-treated human renal 
proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2 [39], although 
supratherapeutic concentrations of pirfenidone (200 and 
500 mg/ml) were again used. However, in other study, 
supratherapeuthic concentrations of pirfenidone had no 
effect on TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 
ARPE-19 cells [26].
Previous studies have demonstrated that Thr41(1224) 
and Tyr46(1229) MUC1-CT phosphorylations induce 
binding of the MUC1-CT to β-catenin, thereby promoting 
the activation of fibrotic genes such as Wnt target 
genes [40] and CTGF [41]. Furthermore, Thr41(1224) 
and Tyr46(1229) phosphorylations promote nuclear 
translocation of the protein complex MUC1-CT/β-catenin, 
thus activating target genes [16]. Recently, we found 
using immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence 
studies that MUC1-CT forms nuclear protein complexes 
with phospho-SMAD3 and active-β-catenin in response 
to TGF-β1, thus promoting the activation of the SBE 
DNA sequence to promote pro-fibrotic gene expression 
[19]. In this study it was demonstrated that pirfenidone 
inhibited the formation of these complexes and the nuclear 
translocation of them, thus inhibiting the activation of the 
SBE DNA sequence.
Lung cells in IPF undergo different types of 
transformations, such as the ATII to mesenchymal 
transition or the transformation of lung resident fibroblasts 
to myofibroblasts [5]. TGF-β1 is considered as the most 
characterised and most potent cellular transformer of 
fibroblasts and ATII cells, and multiple pathways can

modulate its function [8]. Probably, these phenotypic 
similarities between ATII cells and fibroblasts upon 
TGF-β1 action could explain the similar reported 
pirfenidone’s effect on both types of cells along this study. 
This study provided evidence of the inhibitory effect of 
pirfenidone on the TGF-β1-induced ATII to mesenchymal 
and fibroblast to myofibroblast transitions, as determined 
by reducing expression of α-SMA and type I collagen 
in ATII cells and fibroblasts and increasing expression 
of E-cadherin in ATII cells. In previous studies, it was 
observed that pirfenidone mediated the inhibition of 
TGF-β1-induced collagen type I and α-SMA in epithelial 
cells [23, 39, 42, 43] and fibroblasts [26]. However, 
some contradictory findings have also been reported in 
the literature, as pirfenidone did not attenuate the TGF￾β1-induced downregulation of E-cadherin in some in 
vitro cancer models [42, 43], but up-regulated the protein 
expression of E-cadherin in lung tissues of a rat silicosis 
model [44]. We recently observed that neither A549 cells 
nor MRC5 fibroblasts transiently transfected with siRNA￾MUC1 were transformed to myofibroblasts after TGF-β1 
stimulation, as well as, we found using GO-201 that the 
effects of MUC1-CT on the ATII to mesenchymal and 
fibroblast to myofibroblast transitions were dependent on 
MUC1-CT nuclear translocation [19]. Thus, it is suggested 
that the inhibitory effect of pirfenidone inhibiting 
MUC1-CT bioactivation and nuclear translocation is the 
responsible for the inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on the 
TGF-β1-induced ATII to mesenchymal and fibroblast to 
myofibroblast transitions.
Senescence of ATII cells and fibroblasts are also key 
pathological processes in IPF. Furthermore, the senescent 
fibroblast phenotype co-exists with the proliferative 
phenotype. Senescent ATII cells and fibroblast are 
characterized by a metabolically active, hypersecretory 
and apoptosis-resistant phenotype in the lungs of IPF 
patients, contributing to the release of fibrotic growth 
factors, which promote the IPF progression [45–47]. 
Previously, we reported that the inhibition of MUC1-
CT expression via siRNA-MUC1, or of MUC1-CT 
nuclear translocation using GO-201, blocked the ATII 
cell senescence, fibroblast senescence and lung fibroblast 
proliferation induced by TGF-β1 [19]. In this study, 
pirfenidone also attenuated in vitro the TGF-β1-induced 
fibroblast proliferation and senescence, as well as, the 
TGF-β1-induced ATII senescence.
Although β-galactosidase staining has been used 
as the only marker of cell senescence in this study, this 
is a preliminary screening tool that does not provide 
confirmation of senescence. Therefore, alternative cellular 
senescence readouts, such as p21 expression should be 
addressed to further confirm the effect of pirfenidone on 
TGF-β1-induced cell senescence.
The inhibition of senescence by pirfenidone could 
be explained by the inhibition of β-catenin activation, 
as previous studies have suggested that Wnt/β-catenin 
TGF-β1 non-canonical pathway acts as a driver of 
cell senescence in IPF [48], and by inhibition of SBE 
activation, as activation of this DNA element response 
also increases the expression of the senescence markers, 
p21 and p16 [49]. Nevertheless, it has been observed 
no difference in expression of p21 or p16 in the 
lungs of untreated or pirfenidone-treated IPF patients 
[37]. Regarding proliferation, ERK1/2 pathway has

demonstrated to mediate the proliferation in cancer cells 
[50]. However, in this study, pirfenidone did not attenuate 
the ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Therefore, it is suggested 
that pirfenidone anti-proliferative action may be through 
the inhibition of the SBE activation and expression of 
cyclin kinases [51].
Galectin-3, which is a recognised pro-fibrotic factor 
in IPF [52], has als0 demonstrated to phosphorylate 
MUC1-CT, but on a TGF-β1-independent pathway [19]. 
Therefore, we suggest that pirfenidone could inhibit 
MUC1-CT bioactivation and fibrotic processes induced 
or not by TGF-β1. Furthermore, several growth factor 
receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)3, 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) B and 
MET, also results in phosphorylation of MUC1-CT [53]. 
Interestingly, these growth factor receptors not only 
participate in IPF, but also in other proliferative diseases 
such as several malignancies, thus suggesting a protective 
role of pirfenidone for all of them. Indeed, pirfenidone has 
demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical studies 
[54], as well as, it has been observed that the incidence 
of lung cancer in IPF patients treated with pirfenidone is 
significantly lower than in a non-pirfenidone IPF patient 
group [55].
In summary, the present study provided novel 
evidence of pirfenidone’s inhibitory effect on TGF-β1-
induced fibrotic cellular processes, through the inhibitory 
effects of pirfenidone on MUC1-CT phosphorylations, 
β-catenin activation and formation of the nuclear complex 
of phospho-SMAD3/MUC1-CT/act-β-catenin and the 
following SBE activation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and culture of human alveolar type II 
cells and lung fibroblast
Primary ATII cells were obtained from lung 
parenchyma of control donors. Lung parenchyma tissue 
was cut in approximately 1 mm thick sections and lavaged 
with saline. The lung sections were digested with dispase 
II (final concentration, 20 U/100 ml), collagenase/dispase 
(final concentration, 10 mg/100 ml) and DNase I (final 
concentration, 1 mg/ 100 ml) at 37°C for 120 minutes. 
After digestion, the lung sections were filtered through 
nylon meshes ranging in pore size from 100 to 20 mm. The 
resulting cell suspension was centrifuged (300 × g, 20 min 
at 15°C) through a sterile Percoll gradient and the alveolar 
type II cell–rich band was collected. If it was required, 
ATII cell-rich band was resuspended in 5 ml of red blood 
cell lysis buffer and recovered as a pellet by centrifugation 
at 300 × g for 10 minutes. Finally, cells were resuspended 
in a buffer containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
pH 7.2, 2mM ethylenediaminetetraacectic acid (EDTA) 
and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). ATII cells 
were negatively separated using CD45 microbeads in a 
magnetic field (QuadroMACS™ Separator. Miltenyi 
Figure 6: Pirfenidone (PFD) inhibits the TGF-β1-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transition. Primary lung fibroblasts 
were isolated from the lungs of IPF patients. Primary lung fibroblasts (A) or MRC5 cells (B, C) were stimulated 72 h (A, B) or 48h (C) 
with TGFβ1 5 ng/ml in the presence or absence of pirfenidone (PFD) 50 µM. Total protein and RNA from cell lysates were analyzed by 
(A, B) western blot and quantified by densitometry and by (C) qPCR. α-SMA and collagen type I were measured using (A, B) western blot. 
Collagen type I, α-SMA, SNAI2 and SNAIL were measured using (C) RT-PCR. Data are expressed as the ratio to β-actin protein and 2-∆Ct

Biotec). Total cells were counted to establish the final 
yield of freshly purified cells. Alveolar type II cell viability 
was assessed with trypan blue (Sigma), showing greater 
than 95% viability. Cell purity was routinely assessed 
by epithelial cell morphology and immunofluorescence 
analysis with pan-cytokeratin and pro-surfactant protein 
C (both positive) as well as α-SMA and CD45 (both 
negative) of cytocentrifuge preparations of ATII cells. 
ATII cells used throughout this study demonstrated 
95% ± 3% purity. Finally, ATII cells were suspended in 
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) plus 
10% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 
100 g/ml streptomycin and cultured for 48 hours to allow 
attachment. Phenotypic characterization was done after 
this time period. After media change, cells were cultured 
for a maximum of 3 days in a humidified atmosphere of 
5% CO2 at 37°C. The bronchoalveolar A549 cell line has 
been used to model ATII behavior. Although A549 cell 
line can show different properties than primary ATII cells, 
we have used A549 cells for some in vitro experiments 
because their stability and the possibility to obtain 
enough quantity of protein to explore cellular mechanistic 
pathways. The A549 human alveolar type II cell line 
was purchased from American Type Culture Collection 
(Rockville, MD, USA), which authenticates their lines 
via short tandem repeat profiling. They were cultured in 
supplemented Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 
1640 medium at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% 
CO2 in air, as outlined [56]. Cells at 60–70% confluence 
were serum-deprived by incubation for 12–18 h in RPMI 
1640 medium containing 0.1% (v/v) foetal bovine serum 
prior to stimulation with TGFβ1 or other agents.
Primary human lung fibroblasts were obtained from 
lung parenchyma of macroscopically fibrotic affected 
areas of IPF patients as previously outlined [57]. Lung 
parenchyma was cut into small pieces, treated with 
pronase (1 mg/mL; Calbiochem®, Novabiochem®, San 
Diego, CA, USA) at 37°C for 30 min, placed in cell 
culture plates and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 
10% foetal calf serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 100 
U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 2% fungizone (GIBCO, 
Grand Island, NY, USA). After approximately 2 weeks, 
fibroblasts had grown from the tissue and were passaged 
by standard trypsinisation. Cells from passages 3–10 were 
used in all experiments described in the present study.
Normal lung fibroblast MRC5 was purchased from 
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) 
and were cultured in 10% FCS supplemented RPMI-1640 
medium at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 
in air.
For in vitro studies, ATII/A549 or primary lung 
fibroblast/ MRC5 were stimulated with recombinant 
TGF-β1 (Sigma Aldrich; catalog no. T7039) for the 
indicated times and concentrations, replacing culture 
medium and stimulus every 24 h. TGFβ1 has demonstrated 
to induce cell phenotypic changes such as epithelial to 
mesenchymal transition at the indicated concentrations 
[58].
Pirfenidone (antifibrotic drug approved for the 
IPF treatment; Sigma Aldrich; catalog no. G5170) was

added 30 min before stimulus and remained together 
with the stimulus until experimental evaluation. For all 
the experiments, 50 µM doses of pirfenidone were used. 
This concentration was selected since 50 µM (9 mg/ml) 
is between the Cmax (14.7 mg/ml) and Cmin (1.64 mg/ml) 
serum concentrations following a daily dose of 2403 mg of 
pirfenidone (FDA technical pirfenidone brochure). It did 
not affect cell viability assessed with trypan blue (Sigma), 
showing greater than 95% viability.
Western blotting analysis
Western blotting analysis was used to detect 
changes in ATII/A549 and lung fibroblast/MRC5 cell 
protein expression. Cells were scraped from a confluent 
25-cm2
 flask and lysed on ice with a lysis buffer 
comprising a complete inhibitor cocktail plus 1 mM 
ethylenediaminetetraacectic acid (Roche Diagnostics 
Ltd., West Sussex, UK) with 20 mM Tris base, 0.9% 
NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/
mL pepstatin A. The Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories 
Ltd., Herts, UK) was used according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions to quantify the level of protein in each sample 
to ensure equal protein loading. Sodium dodecyl sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate 
the proteins according to their molecular weight. Briefly, 
15 µg of proteins (denatured) along with a molecular 
weight protein marker (Bio-Rad Kaleidoscope marker; 
Bio-Rad Laboratories) were loaded onto an acrylamide 
gel consisting of a 5% acrylamide stacking gel stacked 
on top of a 10% acrylamide resolving gel and run through 
the gel by application of 100 V for 1 h. Proteins were 
transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride 
membrane using a wet-blotting method. The membrane 
was blocked with 5% Marvel in PBS containing 0.1% 
Tween20 (PBS-T), probed with the following antibodies: 
alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (1:1000) antibody 
(42 KDa, monoclonal antibody, Sigma Aldrich, Madrid, 
Spain; catalog no. A5228), collagen type I (1:1000)

phospho (p)-SMAD3 (1:1000) antibody (50 KDa, 
Figure 8: Schematic illustration showing novel evidence for inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on MUC1-CT bioactivation 
in IPF. TGF-β1 binds to TbRI/II, leading to the recruitment and phosphorylation of SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD3 promotes the 
phosphorylation of MUC1-CT at Thr41 and Tyr46, thus increasing the active form of β-catenin. MUC1-CT forms protein complexes with 
phospho (p)-SMAD3 and active (act)-β-catenin in response to TGF-β1; this stimulus promotes nuclear translocation of the phospho￾SMAD3/MUC1-CT/act-β-catenin complex, which is required to activate the SMAD-binding element (SBE) DNA sequence and in turn 
promote pro-fibrotic gene expression, proliferation or cell senescence. Pirfenidone inhibits the TGF-β1-induced Thr41 (1224) and Tyr46
(1229) MUC1-CT phosphorylations, thus reducing the amount of act-β-catenin. Therefore, the nuclear translocation of the p-SMAD3/
MUC1-CT/act-β-catenin complex and induction of SBE is also inhibited by pirfenidone. Additionally, we suggest that pirfenidone also 
inhibits the MUC1-CT phosphorylation induced by galectin-3 and growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth 
factor (FGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF).

method of protein detection using enhanced 
chemiluminescence reagents (ECL Plus; Amersham GE 
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) was used to detect 
labeled proteins. Densitometry of films was performed 
using the Image J 1.42q software (available at http://rsb.
info.nih.gov/ij/, USA). Results of target protein expression 
are expressed as the percentage of the densitometry of the 
endogenous controls β-actin, total SMAD3, total MUC1-
CT, total ERK1/2 or total β-catenin, as appropriate.
Real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TriPure® Isolation 
Reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, USA). The integrity of 
the extracted RNA was confirmed with Bioanalyzer 
(Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Reverse transcription 
was performed in 300 ng of total RNA with a TaqMan 
reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems, 
Perkin-Elmer Corporation, CA, USA). cDNA was 
amplified with specific primers and probes predesigned 
by Applied Biosystems for MUC1 (Hs00159357_m1), 
α-SMA (Hs00559403_m1), α1
(I)-collagen (collagen type 
I; Hs00164004_m1), SNAIL (Hs00195591_m1), SNAI2 
(Hs00161904_m1) and E-cadherin (Hs01023894_m1) 
in a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied 
Biosystems) using Universal Master Mix (Applied 
Biosystems). Expression of the target gene was 
expressed as the fold increase or decrease relative to the 
expression of β-actin as an endogenous control (Applied 
Biosystems; Hs01060665). The mean value of the 
replicates for each sample was calculated and expressed 
as the cycle threshold (Ct). The level of gene expression 
was then calculated as the difference (∆Ct) between the 
Ct value of the target gene and the Ct value of β-actin. 
The fold changes in the target gene mRNA levels were 
designated 2-∆Ct.
Proliferation
Fibroblast proliferation was measured by 
colorimetric immunoassay based on BrdU incorporation 
during DNA synthesis using a cell proliferation enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay BrdU kit (Roche, Mannheim, 
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells 
were seeded at a density of 3 × 103
 cells/well on 96-well 
plates and incubated for 24 hours. TGF-β1 stimulation 
was incubated for 48 h. The 490 nm absorbance was 
quantified using a microplate spectrophotometer (Victor 
1420 Multilabel Counter, PerkinElmer). Proliferation data 
refer to the absorbance values of BrdU-labeled cellular 
DNA content per well.
Cell senescence
Cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 10 ng/ml during 
72h. The senescence cell histochemical staining kit (Sigma 
Aldrich; catalogue no. CS0030) based on a histochemical 
staining for β-galactosidase activity was used. After 
TGF-β1 stimulation, cells were fixed with the fixation 
buffer provided by the kit (solution containing 20% 
formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 70.4 mM Na2HPO4, 
14.7 mM KH2PO4, 1.37 M NaCl, and 26.8 mM KCl) for 
6–7 minutes at room temperature. Cells were stained with 
the staining mixture provided by the kit and incubated at 
37°C without CO2
 overnight. Finally, cells were observed 
under a microscope to count the blue-stained cells and the 
total number of cells x field. Results were expressed as % 
senescence (β-galactosidase blue positive cells) relative to 
the total number of cells in each field.
SBE assay
The SBE Reporter kit (Cat#: 60654, BPSBioscience) 
was used for monitoring the activity of TGF-β/SMAD 
signaling pathway in the cultured cells. One day before 
transfection, cells were seed at a density of 2 × 104
cells per well in 200 µl of 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) medium (antibiotic-free) so that cells were 70% 
confluent at the time of SBE reporter transfection. Plate 
was incubated at 37°C in a CO2
 incubator. Next day, 
the following complexes were prepared: 1 µg of SBE 
luciferase reporter vector + constitutively expressing 
renilla luciferase vector diluted in 22.5 µl of Opti-MEM 
I medium (antibiotic-free). The control transfection 
was the non-inducible luciferase vector + constitutively 
expressing renilla luciferase vector. Complexes were 
incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Diluted 
DNA was combined with diluted Lipofectamine 2000 
and incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature. 45 µl 
of complexes were added to each well containing cells 
and medium and cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% 
CO2
 incubator during 24 hours. After 24 hours, medium 
was changed to 0.5% FBS fresh medium and TGF-β1 

www.oncotarget.com 1317 Oncotarget
(final concentration 10 ng/ml) was added to stimulate 
wells. After 18 hours of stimulation, luciferase activity 
was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter assay system 
(Promega, catalogue no. E1910) following manufacturer’s 
protocol. To obtain the normalized luciferase activity of 
the SBE reporter, background was subtracted, and the ratio 
of firefly luminescence from the SBE reporter to renilla 
luminescence from the control renilla luciferase vector 
was represented.
Immunoprecipitation
Equal amounts of protein (200 µg) from total 
protein extracts were incubated with 2 µg of p-Smad3, 
act-β-catenin or anti-MUC1-CT antibodies and the IgG 
isotype control. The immune complexes were precipitated 
with protein G on Sepharose 4B fast flow beads (Sigma 
Aldrich; catalogue no. P-3296) overnight at 4°C. After 
washing three times with NET buffer containing 50 
mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% 
Nonidet P-40, the bound materials were eluted from the 
immunoprecipitates in reducing SDS-PAGE loading 
buffer containing 10% SDS, 1 M Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 50% 
glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% bromophenol 
blue at 100°C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitated protein 
complexes were assayed by western blotting as described 
above and probed using p-SMAD3, act-β-catenin or anti￾MUC1-CT antibodies, as appropriate.
Immunofluorescence
MUC1-CT, p-SMAD3 and act-β-catenin in ATII 
and fibroblasts were analyzed by immunofluorescence. 
Cells were firstly fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%) for 24 
h. Following it, cells were permeabilized (20 mM HEPES 
at pH 7.6, 300 mM sucrose, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2
, 
0.5% Triton X-100), blocked (10% goat serum in PBS), 
and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight 
at 4°C, followed by secondary antibody anti-rabbit/
mouse rhodamine/FITC- (1:100, Molecular Probes). 
Colocalization of MUC1-CT/ p-SMAD3 and MUC1-CT/ 
act-β-catenin was performed using a confocal spectral 
Leica TCS SP2 microscope with ×1000 magnification and 
3× zoom. Red (HeNe 543 nm), green (HeNe 488 nm), and 
blue (Ar 351 nm, 364 nm) lasers were used. Colocalization 
studies were performed using the Leica confocal software 
v2.61. The cell images with colocalized points of the two 
laser canals were transformed into a white color.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of results was carried out by 
parametric analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Results were expressed as mean ± SE of n 
experiments. Multiple comparisons were analysed by 
one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. A P value < 0.05 
was considered significant.
