Abstract
Background: Airway inflammation in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by infiltration of CD8+
T cells and CD68+ macrophages and an increased number of
neutrophils, whereas few studies have described the presence of
eosinophils. Although the anti-inflammatory effects of
corticosteroids in stable COPD are unclear, recent studies suggest
that combination therapy could be beneficial. A study was therefore
undertaken to evaluate combined salmeterol/fluticasone propionate
(SFC) and fluticasone propionate (FP) alone on inflammatory cells
in the airways of patients with COPD.
Methods: Patients were treated in a randomised, double blind,
parallel group, placebo-controlled trial with either a combination of
50 µg salmeterol and 500 µg FP twice daily (SFC, n = 19, 19 men,
mean age 62 years), 500 µg FP twice daily (n = 20, 15 men, mean
age 64 years) or placebo (n = 21, 17 men, mean age 66 years) for 3
months. At the start and end of treatment bronchoscopy with
bronchial biopsies was performed and the numbers of CD8+ T
lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils
were measured.
Results: CD8+ cells were significantly reduced by SFC compared
with placebo (difference −98.05 cells/mm2; 95% CI −143.14 to
−52.9; p<0.001). Such a marked effect was not seen with FP alone
(−44.67 cells/mm2; 95% CI −90.92 to 1.57; p = 0.06). CD68+
macrophages were also reduced by SFC compared with placebo


(difference −31.68 cells/mm2; 95% CI −61.07 to −2.29; p = 0.03)
but not by FP. SFC did not significantly change neutrophils and
eosinophils compared with placebo.
Conclusions: SFC has airway anti-inflammatory effects not seen
with inhaled corticosteroids alone.
