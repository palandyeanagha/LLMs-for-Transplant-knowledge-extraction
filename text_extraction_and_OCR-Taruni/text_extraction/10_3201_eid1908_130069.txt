because it was obtained from a rela￾tive, and possible unreported drug￾related travel by the patient to neigh￾boring countries cannot be fully 
excluded. R. muelleri, the jungle rat 
and definitive host for S. malayensis, 
is often seen at river banks (4), and 
rodent feces could have contaminated 
the water with schistosome eggs.
Future field studies are needed 
to identify focal hot spots of sylvatic 
transmission by snail examination and 
seroprevalence studies of persons living 
in rural areas, especially the Orang Asli 
population. Moreover, in light of grow￾ing ecotourism, which also encompass￾es stays at remote Orang Asli villages 
and canoeing on small streams (10), ap￾propriate public health measures, such 
as rodent and snail control near tourist 
sites, should be implemented.

Asian Musk Shrew 
as a Reservoir of 
Rat Hepatitis E 
Virus, China
To the Editor: Rat hepatitis E vi￾rus (HEV), a member of genus Hepevi￾rus in the family Hepeviridae, was first 
detected in Norway rats in Germany in 
2010 (1, 2). Since then, this rat HEVhas 
been detected in multiple wild rat spe￾cies in the United States, Vietnam, 
Germany, and Indonesia (3–7). Stud￾ies have shown that rat HEV failed 
to infect rhesus monkeys and pigs,

suggesting that rat HEV is restricted 
to its natural host (6, 8). However, it is 
not known whether animals other than 
rats are susceptible to rat HEV.
The Asian musk shrew (Suncus 
murinus), also called the Asian house 
shrew, is a small mole-like mammal 
belonging to the family Soricidae (or￾der Soricomorpha), and wild rats are 
classified in the family Muridae (order 
Rodentia). Musk shrews originated 
from the Indian subcontinent and are 
now found from southern Asia and 
Afghanistan to the Malay Archipelago 
and southern Japan. These shrews are 
commensal rodents, commonly found 
living in human households. We previ￾ously showed that rat HEV infection 
frequently occurs in wild rats in Zhan￾jiang City, Guangdong Province, China 
(9). Asian musk shrews share this same 
environment; thus, they can be exposed 
to rat HEV derived from wild rats.
To determine whether Asian musk 
shrews are a reservoir for rat HEV, we 
examined 260 shrews (112 males, 148 
females) that were trapped in Zhan￾jiang City during December 2011–
September 2012. Of the 260 trapped 
shrews, 147 were from Mazhang Dis￾trict (23 from a pig farm and 124 from 
the villages of Chiling, Chofa, Beigou, 
Huangwai, Houyang, and Nanpan) 
and 113 were from Chikan District.
Blood samples were collected 
from the shrews, and serum was sepa￾rated by centrifugation (2,500 × g for 
20 min at 4°C), and stored at −80°C 
until use. We tested the serum samples 
for the presence of HEV IgG and IgM 
antibodies by using an ELISA based 
on rat HEV-like particles, as described 
(3). Of the 260 samples, 27 (10.4%) 
were HEV IgG positive and 12 (4.6%) 
were HEV IgM positive. Of these, 
3 IgG-positive and 1 IgM-positive 
samples were among the 113 samples 
(2.7% and 1.0%, respectively) collect￾ed from shrews in Chikan District, and 
24 IgG-positive and 11 IgM-positive 
samples were among the 147 samples 
(16.3% and 7.5%, respectively) col￾lected from shrews in 6 villages (124 
total samples) and the pig farm (23 
total samples) in Mazhang District. 
The IgG-positive rate was higher for 
shrews from Mazhang District than for 
those from Chikan District (p<0.05); 
the rates of IgM-positivity did not dif￾fer significantly. The IgG-positive rate 
among the 6 villages varied substan￾tially (8.3%–71.4%) (online Technical 
Appendix Table 1, wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article/19/8/13-0069-Techapp1.
pdf). The IgG-positive rates were 
11.6% (13/112) in male and 9.5% 
(14/148) in female shrews, respective￾ly; the difference in rates between the 
sexes was not statistically significant.
A total of 12 IgM-positive serum 
samples were selected for HEV RNA 
testing by nested broad-spectrum re￾verse transcription PCR (2); results 
for 5 were positive (online Technical 
Appendix Table 2). The length of the 
nested reverse transcription PCR prod￾ucts was 334 nt. After the primer se￾quences were removed, we sequenced 
the remaining 281 nt corresponding to 
nt 4107–4387 in the C-terminal open 
reading frame 1 of the rat HEV genome 
(GU345042) (GenBank accession nos. 
KC473527–KC473531). Phylogenetic 
analysis indicated that the 5 HEV iso￾lates were all classified into the same 
group as rat HEV and clearly separated 
into 2 clusters, A and C. Cluster A iso￾lates were further divided into 2 sub￾clusters, sub-A1 (CHZ-sRat-E-1107) 
and sub-A2 (CHZ-sRat-E-1133) (Fig￾ure). Strains CHZ-sRat-E-739, CHZ￾sRat-E-1086, and CHZ-sRat-E-1129 
belong to cluster C. These findings are 
of limited precision because of the shot 
sequence that was analyzed, and, thus, 
they may not be predictive of results 
obtained with complete genomes.
Rat HEV isolated from the S. mu￾rinus shrews shared 77.4%–99.6% nt 
sequence identity with other rat HEV 
strains; the sequences were especially 
similar to those of HEV isolates from 
wild rats in this area (GenBank acces￾sion nos. KC465990–KC466001) (on￾line Technical Appendix Table 3). In 
addition, nucleotide sequences from 
subcluster A1 and A2 and cluster C rat 
and shrew strains shared 97.5%–99.6%, 
96.8%–97.2%, and 94.0%–97.5% 
identity, respectively (online Technical 
Appendix Table 3). These results indi￾cate that rat HEV infection occurs in S. 
murinus shrews and that these rodents 
are a reservoir for rat HEV.
Evidence indicates that rat HEV 
may be capable of inducing an im￾mune response in humans; thus, this 
virus may be relevant to the epide￾miology of HEV in humans (10). A 
key step in understanding this epide￾miology is to know the reservoirs of 
rat HEV, especially reservoirs like S. 
murinus shrews, which live in close 
proximity to humans.

No Evidence for 
Hepatitis E Virus 
Genotype 3 
Susceptibility 
in Rats
To the editor: Hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) is a positive-sense single-strand￾ed RNA virus (genus Hepevirus, fam￾ily Hepeviridae) (1). In humans, acute 
hepatitis infection caused by HEV is a 
serious public health concern in devel￾oping countries. Four HEV genotypes, 
G1–4, have been isolated from humans 
(2). G3 and G4 HEV have also been 
isolated from swine, wild boars, wild 
deer, and mongooses; these animals 
are thought to be the reservoirs of HEV 
(3). Direct evidence has indicated that 
HEV is transmitted from pigs or wild 
boars to humans; therefore, hepatitis E 
caused by G3 and G4 HEV infection is 
recognized as a zoonosis (3).
Although rats have long been 
suspected to be a potential reservoir 
for human HEV, no direct evidence 
has been found. The susceptibility 
of rats to human HEV genotypes is

shrews (Suncus murinus) in Zhanjiang City, China. Nucleic acid sequence alignment was
performed by using ClustalX 1.81 (www.clustal.org). The genetic distance was calculated
by using the Kimura 2-parameter method. The phylogenetic tree, with 1,000 bootstrap
replicates, was generated by the neighbor-joining method based on the partial sequence
(281 nt) of HEV open reading frame 1 of genotype 1–4, wild boar, rabbit, ferret, bat, avian,
and rat HEV isolates. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.
