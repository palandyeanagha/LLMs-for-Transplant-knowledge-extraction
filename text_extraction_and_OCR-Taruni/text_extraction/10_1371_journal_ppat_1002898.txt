Abstract
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is an emerging pathogen whose reactivation causes severe disease in transplant patients.
Unfortunately, there is no specific anti-BKPyV treatment available, and host cell components that affect the infection
outcome are not well characterized. In this report, we examined the relationship between BKPyV productive infection and
the activation of the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) in natural host cells. Our results showed that both the ataxia￾telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and ATM and Rad-3-related (ATR)-mediated DDR were activated during BKPyV infection,
accompanied by the accumulation of polyploid cells. We assessed the involvement of ATM and ATR during infection using
small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdowns. ATM knockdown did not significantly affect viral gene expression, but reduced
BKPyV DNA replication and infectious progeny production. ATR knockdown had a slightly more dramatic effect on viral T
antigen (TAg) and its modified forms, DNA replication, and progeny production. ATM and ATR double knockdown had an
additive effect on DNA replication and resulted in a severe reduction in viral titer. While ATM mainly led to the activation of
pChk2 and ATR was primarily responsible for the activation of pChk1, knockdown of all three major phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase-like kinases (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs) did not abolish the activation of cH2AX during BKPyV infection. Finally, in the
absence of ATM or ATR, BKPyV infection caused severe DNA damage and aberrant TAg staining patterns. These results
indicate that induction of the DDR by BKPyV is critical for productive infection, and that one of the functions of the DDR is to
minimize the DNA damage which is generated during BKPyV infection.

Introduction
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) was first isolated in 1971 from a
renal transplant patient [1] and has gained much interest in the
past two decades due to its disease prevalence in immunocom￾promised patients [2]. Infection with BKPyV is ubiquitous in
healthy individuals but does not lead to any known clinical disease.
Under immunosuppressed conditions, especially in renal trans￾plant and bone marrow transplant recipients, the virus can
reactivate from a persistent state to lytic infection, which results in
severe disease including polyomavirus-associated nephropathy
(PVAN) and hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), respectively [2]. Unfortu￾nately, there is currently no FDA-approved, specific anti-BKPyV
drug available for treating these diseases. The common approach
to control BKPyV reactivation is palliative care for HC patients, or
combining immunosuppression reduction with drugs that inhibit
viral DNA replication for PVAN, although there are often
conflicting outcomes with these treatment options [3].
Much of the knowledge about the polyomavirus lytic life cycle
comes from research performed on Simian Virus 40 (SV40). The
viral genome, a circular double-stranded DNA molecule, is
delivered into the nucleus. Following nuclear entry, early proteins
including the large T antigen (TAg) are expressed. TAg sets up the
host environment for viral DNA replication by inducing cells into
S phase and, at the same time, inhibiting the p53-dependent
apoptotic pathway [4]. Initiation of viral DNA replication requires
the concerted efforts of TAg, replication protein A (RPA), DNA
polymerase alpha-primase (Pol-prim), and topoisomerase I [5].
Newly replicated viral DNA is encapsidated by the capsid proteins
VP1, VP2, and VP3, and this is followed by viral egress and cell
lysis, thus completing the life cycle. Although SV40 is well-studied,
there are differences between it and BKPyV. There is still much
that is unknown with regard to the interaction between host
nuclear components and viral factors during BKPyV replication.
Identification and characterization of these interactions is
extremely important, since it may reveal novel anti-viral thera￾peutic targets.
The DNA damage response (DDR) is emerging as a cellular
process that is targeted by a number of DNA and RNA viruses
[6,7]. The DDR involves signaling cascades that are initiated
when cells experience various types of DNA damage, and it
coordinates many cellular processes including cell cycle arrest,
chromatin modification, and DNA repair to allow cells to repair
the damaged DNA [8,9]. This response is largely orchestrated by
two major phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (PI3KKs):
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM and Rad3-related

(ATR) kinase. ATM mainly responds to double-stranded breaks
(DSBs) resulting from conditions such as ionizing irradiation (IR).
The Mre11-Rad50-NBSI (MRN) protein complex serves as a
sensor for DSBs, and is crucial for the activation of ATM upon
DSB damage [10,11]. ATR, on the other hand, is activated by
single-stranded DNA lesions and is important for resolving
replication stress from conditions such as stalled replication forks
and ultraviolet (UV) light [8]. Both kinases, when activated, can
phosphorylate numerous downstream targets that are involved in
DNA repair and cell cycle arrest, including Chk1, Chk2, and a
histone variant H2AX [8,12]. The phosphorylated H2AX (serine
139, referred to as cH2AX) is considered a hallmark of the DDR,
and it is crucial for recruiting and maintaining downstream
mediator and repair proteins to sites of damage [13,14].
There is accumulating evidence suggesting that the DDR is
closely linked to polyomavirus infections. Mouse polyomavirus
(MPyV) infection increases phosphorylated ATM (pATM), and
using either an ATM inhibitor or ATM-deficient cells, it has been
demonstrated that an ATM-mediated DDR is required for MPyV
replication [15]. ATM phosphorylates SV40 TAg, and knock￾down of ATM decreases the level of TAg-pS120 and viral DNA
synthesis [16]. The ATM-mediated DDR has also been reported
to be required for SV40 infection, and SV40 infection is found to
lead to the proteasome-dependent degradation of MRN complex
[17,18]. Another human polyomavirus, JC polyomavirus (JCPyV),
also activates the ATM DDR. It is suggested that DDR activation
induces G2 arrest to promote JCPyV replication [19]. The
contribution of the ATR-mediated DDR to polyomavirus
infection is less clear. Although knockdown of ATR during JCPyV
infection results in a decrease in TAg levels, ATR knockdown does
not seem to affect SV40 DNA replication [18]. This lack of effect
on viral replication has been attributed to incomplete knockdown
of ATR and kinase redundancy [18]. Using a cell line that
expresses a dominant negative form of ATR, another group
showed that ATR is required for the activation of ATR-Dp53
signaling pathway during SV40 infection [20]. The activation of
this pathway is believed to lead to intra-S checkpoint activation
and promote TAg- Pol-prim complex formation [20]. Finally, a
recent microarray analysis has shown that several genes that are
involved in DNA damage repair are also upregulated with BKPyV
infection, indicating that the DDR may be important during
BKPyV infection [21].
In this study we examined the roles of both the ATM and ATR￾mediated DDR during lytic BKPyV infection in a primary human
renal proximal tubule epithelial (RPTE) cell culture model [22].
Our results showed that BKPyV activates both branches of the
DDR. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdowns, we
demonstrated that ATM and ATR each contribute to DDR
activation caused by BKPyV infection. Our data also clearly
suggested the importance of ATR during lytic BKPyV infection,
and more importantly, that both proteins function additively to
ensure efficient viral DNA replication and synergistically to affect
production of viral progeny. In the absence of either kinase, severe
DNA damage accumulated during BKPyV infection, indicating
that part of the roles that ATM and ATR play is to repair DNA
damage caused by BKPyV infection.
Results
BKPyV infection activates an ATM-mediated DDR
To investigate the relationship between BKPyV and the DDR,
we began our studies with the ATM-mediated branch of DDR,
because it has been implicated in many polyomavirus infections
[15–18]. To examine whether BKPyV infection activates an
ATM-mediated DDR, we harvested total protein lysates from
mock- and BKPyV-infected RPTE cells over a 3-day time course.
The proteins were immunoblotted for markers that are indicative
of ATM-mediated DDR activation (Figure 1A). The gradual
increase in the viral early protein TAg allowed us to monitor the
progression of infection. In our Western blots for TAg, we
routinely observe two bands using a monoclonal anti-TAg
antibody, which are labeled as TAg and TAg* (filled arrowheads).
We think these are two forms of TAg because TAg is known to
undergo multiple post-translational modifications [23–25]. While
the total level of ATM remained constant throughout the course of
infection, the level of ATM-pS1981 increased dramatically by 2
days post infection (dpi). Concomitant with the increase of ATM￾pS1981, there was an induction of NBSI-pS343, cH2AX, Chk2-
pT68, RPA32-pS4/8, and p53-pS15, all of which are downstream
targets of active ATM-pS1981 [8,12]. The induction of both
ATM-pS1981 and cH2AX was similar to that seen when RPTE
cells were treated with IR (data not shown), suggesting that our
detection of DDR markers is specific. There was an increase in
total p53 levels following BKPyV infection, consistent with
previous reports of TAg stabilizing p53 [26–28]. In contrast to
SV40 [17], BKPyV did not cause degradation of MRN
components. In addition, we detected that BKPyV infection
resulted in unique cH2AX and Mre11 staining patterns (Figure
S1). There was a marked increase in both bright foci and pan￾nuclear staining of cH2AX, as well as bright nuclear foci of
Mre11. Some, but not all of these foci co-localized with small TAg
foci. Together, these results demonstrated that the ATM signaling
pathway is activated upon BKPyV infection in RPTE cells.
We next determined whether BKPyV infection led to cell cycle
dysregulation (Figure 1B), which is commonly seen with DDR
activation. Flow cytometry analysis of cells stained with propidium
iodide (PI) showed that starting from 2 dpi, in cells that were
infected with BKPyV, there was a gradual increase of a cell
population with .G2 DNA content (Figure 1B and 1C). The
accumulation of these polyploid cells persisted until 6 dpi (data not
shown), whereas in mock-infected cells, most cells were in the G0/
G1 phase throughout the time course. These data indicated that
multiple rounds of DNA replication can occur within a single cell
Author Summary
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a human pathogen that
establishes a persistent sub-clinical infection in healthy
humans. When patients are immunosuppressed, particu￾larly in kidney and bone marrow transplantation, the virus
can reactivate and result in severe disease. BKPyV-related
disease has risen due to the use of newer immunosup￾pressive regimens and an increase in the number of
transplants performed each year. We are interested in
understanding the interactions between BKPyV and host
cell components or pathways, with the aim of developing
more BKPyV-specific antiviral treatment options. In this
study we characterized the relationship between BKPyV
infection and the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), a
signaling cascade that is initiated by cells to repair
damaged DNA molecules. Our study indicated that BKPyV
activates and hijacks the DDR to facilitate its infection and
that various components of the DDR may play distinct
roles during this process. These data suggest that the DDR
may provide a potential host target to control BKPyV
reactivation in transplant recipients.

cycle in BKPyV-infected cells, and are consistent with the
activation of the DDR.
ATM contributes to BKPyV replication
To address the functional roles of the ATM-mediated DDR in
productive BKPyV infection, we knocked down ATM using
siRNA and assessed the effects of the knockdown on BKPyV
infection. RPTE cells were first transfected with siRNAs that
targeted ATM, followed by infection with BKPyV when the
knockdown of ATM was achieved at 3 days post transfection (dpt)
(Figure 2). By Western blotting, ,90% of the total ATM was
knocked down, which was also confirmed by immunoblotting
against ATM-pS1981 (Figure 2A and data not shown). The
knockdown lasted throughout the course of infection and was not
affected by BKPyV replication (Figure 2A). Moreover, knockdown
of ATM did not affect the morphology or viability of RPTE cells
compared to cells that did not receive siRNA or cells that were
transfected with non-targeting siRNA control (data not shown).
We first compared the level of TAg in ATM knockdown cells to
control cells using immunoblotting. The expression of TAg was
similar among all the cells over a 3-day time course, suggesting
that ATM was not required for viral early gene expression
(Figure 2A). We then examined whether ATM knockdown
resulted in a defect in viral DNA replication or infectious progeny
production. Low molecular weight DNA was extracted from the
samples and real-time PCR was employed to measure the viral
DNA load (Figure 2B). The knockdown led to an ,60% decrease
of viral DNA compared to control cells by 3 dpi (Figure 2B).
Consistently, we also observed an approximately 50% decrease of
viral infectious progeny in ATM knockdown cells (Figure 2C).
These data suggested that ATM contributes to optimal BKPyV
DNA replication and viral growth.
To ask whether ATM was responsible for the activation of the
DDR we observed during BKPyV infection, total proteins from
mock- and BKPyV-infected ATM knockdown cells were im￾munoblotted for Chk2-pT68 and cH2AX and compared to
control cells (Figure 2D). ATM knockdown partially abolished the
induction of Chk2-pT68 caused by BKPyV infection (Figure 2D),

consistent with ATM being the main kinase that phosphorylates
Chk2 during the DDR [8,12]. cH2AX, however, was still induced
in BKPyV-infected, ATM knockdown cells (Figure 2D). These
data suggested that ATM may not be the sole contributor to the
BKPyV-induced DDR.
ATR contributes to partial DDR activation during BKPyV
infection
The fact that ATM knockdown did not completely eliminate the
BKPyV-activated DDR suggested that there are other DDR
factors involved. Both ATM and ATR share a number of
substrates and therefore it is possible that the DDR activation we
observed during BKPyV infection was, in part, a result of ATR
activation. To determine whether the ATR-mediated DDR is also
activated during BKPyV infection, we immunoblotted proteins
from mock- and BKPyV-infected RPTE cells for ATR, Chk1-
pS317, and Chk1-pS296 (Figure 3A). ATR levels remained
relatively unchanged during infection; however, both Chk1-
pS317 and Chk1-pS296 increased starting at 2 dpi. Chk1-pS317
phosphorylation is a direct result of ATR activation upon DNA
damage, which is followed by Chk1 autophosphorylation on S296
[29]. The strong induction of both Chk1-pS317 and Chk1-pS296
clearly suggested that an ATR-mediated DDR is also activated by
BKPyV infection.
Next, we used siRNAs to either singly knock down ATR or
doubly knock down both ATM and ATR, and examined the
effects of these knockdowns on the DDR activation during BKPyV
infection. Quantitative Western blotting showed that the knock￾downs were ,90% complete, and no significant cellular viability
changes were noticed in knockdown cells (Figure 3B and data not
shown). Having established that, we went on to determine whether
ATR single knockdown or ATM+ATR double knockdown could
eliminate the BKPyV-induced DDR in RPTE cells. Total proteins
from mock- and BKPyV-infected control or knockdown cells were
immunoblotted for Chk1-pS317, Chk1-pS296, Chk2-pT68, and
cH2AX (Figure 3B). ATM knockdown reduced Chk2-pT68 in
infected cells, whereas ATR single or ATM+ATR double
knockdown almost completely abolished the induction of both
Chk1-pS317 and Chk1-pS296. ATR knockdown, however, did
not significantly alter the induction of Chk2-pT68. These data
suggested that ATM was mainly responsible for the activation of
pChk2 upon BKPyV infection, while ATR was more important in
inducing pChk1. cH2AX induction was still evident even in
ATM+ATR double knockdown cells (Figure 3B), suggesting that

ATM and ATR may not be the only kinases contributing to the
phosphorylation of this DDR marker.
ATR functions in parallel to ATM during BKPyV infection
We then investigated the role that ATR plays alone and in
conjunction with ATM during productive BKPyV infection. We
first measured viral gene expression in these knockdown cells. At
2 dpi, we did not detect a significant difference in the level of TAg
between any knockdown cells and control cells (Figure 4A and S2),
but a third TAg band appeared in the ATR and double
knockdown cells (Figure 4A, open arrowhead). This band was
no longer present at 3 dpi. In contrast to the ATM knockdown
alone, at 3 dpi the ATR knockdown displayed a more marked
difference in TAg and TAg*. There was about a 50% decrease of
TAg in ATR knockdown cells, and an ,80% decrease of TAg*.
The ATM and ATR double knockdown sample had a pattern
similar to the ATR knockdown alone (Figure 4B and 4C). None of
the knockdowns, however, had a major effect on late gene VP1
expression (Figure 4D and S2). To ensure that we did not saturate
the cells with large amounts of BKPyV, we repeated these
experiments with a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.01 IU/
cell vs. 0.5 IU/cell). Quantitative Western blotting showed that
there was no significant difference in either TAg or VP1 levels
among all the knockdown and control cells (Figure S3A and S3B)
at 2 dpi, suggesting that the lack of difference in TAg and VP1
levels at 2 dpi is not due to compensation from a high MOI
infection.
TAg is required for the initiation of viral DNA synthesis and it
provides a conducive host replication environment by inactivating
the retinoblastoma susceptibility family proteins and p53 [4]. We
therefore determined whether a change in TAg in ATR
knockdown cells was accompanied by a defect in viral DNA
replication. Using quantitative PCR, we found that ATR or ATM
knockdown caused a similar decrease in viral DNA synthesis at
2 dpi (Figure 4E). The double knockdown cells, however,
exhibited a more severe defect in viral DNA levels at both high
and low MOIs (Figure 4E and Figure S3C), suggesting that ATM
and ATR function additively to ensure full viral DNA replication.
Finally, we measured infectious viral progeny production under
these knockdown conditions (Figure 4F). ATR single knockdown
led to a slightly larger decrease in viral titer compared to ATM
single knockdown. The double knockdown cells displayed a
dramatic decrease (,90%) compared to the control cells.
To confirm the importance of the ATR/Chk1 pathway in
BKPyV infection, we treated RPTE cells with the Chk1 inhibitor
UCN-01 at 1 dpi (at which time the viral genome is delivered into
the nucleus) [30]. The presence of UCN-01 slightly reduced TAg
and VP1 levels (Figure 5A). Treatment with UCN-01 also resulted
in a partial decrease in viral DNA replication and a severe
reduction in viral titer (Figure 5B and 5C), consistent with ATR/
Chk1 pathway being required for BKPyV productive infection.
We have also tested the effect of the ATM inhibitor KU55933;
however, this drug seemed to have some off-target effects in RPTE
cells and therefore we could not draw conclusions from these
experiments (data not shown).
cH2AX persists in ATM/ATR/DNA-PKcs triple knockdown
cells
It has previously been shown that another PI3KK that is
involved in nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair, DNA￾dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), is able to phosphorylate
H2AX independent of ATM and ATR [31,32]. Additionally, for
certain viruses such as adeno-associated virus (AAV), the induction
of the DDR in infected cells is mostly mediated through DNA￾PKcs [33]. We therefore tested the effect of DNA-PKcs single
knockdown and ATM/ATR/DNA-PKcs triple knockdown on
BKPyV infection and the induction of cH2AX (Figure 6). The
DNA-PKcs-targeting siRNAs efficiently knocked down DNA￾PKcs, but they also reduced ATM (Figure 6A). The single
knockdown slightly increased TAg, TAg*, and VP1, with a
concomitant ,2 fold increase in viral DNA and viral titer
(Figure 6C and 6E). The impact of the ATM/ATR/DNA-PKcs
knockdown is similar to that of the ATM/ATR double
knockdown. There is an ,60% drop in viral DNA and a more
striking difference in viral titer (Figure 6D and 6F). Surprisingly,
with all three kinases absent, we could still detect a strong
induction of cH2AX in BKPyV-infected cells (Figure 6B). These
data suggested that additional cellular kinases may be involved in
the activation of DDR during BKPyV infection.

ATM and/or ATR knockdown causes severe DNA damage
with BKPyV infection
To further dissect the roles that ATM and ATR play during
BKPyV infection, we next examined the localization of TAg in
knockdown and control cells (Figure 7). In all the mock-infected
cells, the nuclei appeared normal judged by DAPI staining (data
not shown). With BKPyV infection, however, we observed some
abnormal DAPI staining in ATM/ATR single or double
knockdown cells (Figure 7A). In these cells, we observed that the
nuclei sometimes appeared smaller or fragmented (open arrow￾heads, Figure 7A, and Figure 7B), which are very similar to
micronuclei that arise when chromosomes are broken or damaged
[34]. At the same time, we also observed aberrant TAg staining
patterns in the knockdown cells (Figure 7A). While TAg appeared
mostly nuclear in control cells, in ATM and ATR knockdown cells
we often observed cells that had diffuse TAg staining, sometimes
throughout the whole cytoplasm (Figure 7A, filled arrowheads,
and Figure 7C). In addition, in cells that received ATR siRNA,
some of the cells showed fragmented TAg staining patterns
(Figure 7A, arrows, and Figure 7C), similar to the fragmented
DAPI staining.
To confirm that the observed aberrant DAPI and TAg staining
is indeed associated with DNA damage, we performed metaphase
chromosome analysis in control and knockdown cells, with or
without BKPyV infections (Figure 8). In all the mock-infected cells

(including all the knockdown cells), or BKPyV-infected cells with
no knockdowns, most chromosome spreads were normal. In ATM
or ATR knockdown cells, there were a very high percentage of
metaphases showing a shattered phenotype, with ATR single
knockdown showing the most severe defect (Figure 8A and 8C).
These numbers might even be underestimated considering that we
could not distinguish between uninfected and infected cells in the
metaphase spreads. Shattered chromosomes were never observed
in uninfected cells. Among the metaphases that were not shattered,
the average number of chromosome breaks per cell was also
higher in BKPyV-infected, ATM/ATR knockdown cells
(Figure 8B). These data suggested that ATM, and to a greater
extent, ATR, contribute to repairing DNA damage that is
triggered by BKPyV infection.

Discussion
In this report we characterized the relationship between the
ATM- and ATR-mediated DDR and lytic BKPyV infection. Our
results indicated that both branches of the DDR were activated by
BKPyV; moreover, ATM and ATR functioned in parallel and
contributed to the activation of individual DDR pathways
(Figure 9A). In particular, ATM was mainly responsible for
activating pChk2, whereas ATR was more important in activating
pChk1 and also might be important for regulating TAg and its
modified forms. Our results showed that both ATM and ATR
were required to achieve maximal viral DNA replication and
infectious progeny production. This is the first such report for any
polyomavirus family member to our knowledge. Knocking down
each individual kinase resulted in a partial defect in viral
replication and the double knockdown had a more dramatic
effect. When comparing ATM and ATR double knockdown cells
to control cells, the degree of decrease in viral titer was consistently
greater than the decrease in viral DNA, suggesting that there may

and ATR function. For example, ATR may be involved in
alleviating the DNA replication stress generated during the
resolution of the two daughter circular BKPyV chromosomes,
and therefore ATR knockdown caused a more marked defect in
viral progeny production than in DNA replication. Our results
also showed that in the absence of ATM or ATR, severe
chromosome damage accumulated upon BKPyV infection. These
data point out that another possible function of ATM and ATR
during BKPyV infection is to help repair the DNA damage caused
by BKPyV (Figure 9B).
The exact role of ATM during polyomavirus early gene
expression remains unclear, but it may be different depending
on the specific virus and cell type. For example, one report showed
that ATM knockdown in African green monkey CV1 cells reduced
the level of SV40 TAg-pS120, but it did not have much effect on
the total level of TAg [16]. In another report using BSC40 monkey
kidney cells, the ATM inhibitor KU55933 reduced total SV40
TAg levels [17]. Our ATM knockdown data suggest that ATM is
not required for TAg expression during BKPyV infection.
Consistent with this, BKPyV TAg expression was similar in
wild-type and ATM-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cell
lines (data not shown). Unfortunately we cannot study the entire
BKPyV life cycle in mouse cells due to a block to DNA replication
[35].
Our data demonstrate the importance of ATM and ATR
during BKPyV DNA replication, DDR activation, and progeny
production. It is possible that ATM, ATR and downstream
effectors directly participate in replication-related events. For
example, ATM has been reported to phosphorylate SV40 TAg in
vivo and therefore is required for optimal SV40 replication [16]. In
our ATR single knockdown or ATM+ATR double knockdown
cells, we observed a decrease in a modified form of TAg (TAg*) at
3 dpi, and the appearance of a third band of TAg at 2 dpi
(Figure 4A). Preliminary experiments indicated that phosphatase
treatment did not affect the level of TAg or TAg* (data not
shown), but this does not definitively rule out the possibility that
TAg* may represent a phosphorylated form of TAg. Additionally,
proteins involved in homologous recombination or the Fanconi
anemia pathway (required for repair of stalled replication forks)
have been found to be necessary for SV40 replication [18]. It is

possible that DDR proteins that are downstream of ATM and
ATR directly contribute to BKPyV DNA replication. Alterna￾tively, instead of being directly involved in viral replication, ATM
and ATR may participate indirectly in BKPyV infection by
affecting cell cycle status. For example, ATM and ATR activation
leads to G2 arrest in JCPyV-infected human neuroblastoma cells
and oligodendrocytes [19]. It is hypothesized that G2 arrest
contributes to JCPyV replication by maintaining the cellular
replication machinery and preventing mitosis [19]. Our cell cycle
analyses also showed that BKPyV infection of RPTE cells results
in the accumulation of polyploid cells, consistent with the idea that
mitosis is inhibited to allow for maximal DNA replication.
A number of DDR proteins including cH2AX and Mre11 were
re-localized into small TAg-containing foci during BKPyV
infection. Similar co-localization between DDR proteins and
TAg foci is seen during SV40 infection, although the MRN
proteins are eventually degraded during SV40 infection [17,18]. It
has been hypothesized that these foci represent sites of viral DNA
replication because they also contain proteins that are required for
viral replication including RPA and Pol-prim, but not Pol-prim￾associated host replication factor [17]. In addition to the small,
bright foci of cH2AX, there was also an increase in pan-nuclear
staining of cH2AX in BKPyV-infected cells. Although the
functional significance of this increase is not clear, it has previously
also been reported in other DNA virus infections such as
adenovirus and AAV [33,36,37]. It is thought that this pan￾nuclear staining increase may represent modification of histones
on cellular chromatin and that the modification can be stimulated
by viral replication.
Intriguingly, the induction of cH2AX by BKPyV still occurred
in ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs triple knockdown cells, suggesting
that there might be other cellular kinase(s) responsible for
phosphorylating this molecule. Alternatively, it is possible that
BKPyV infection alters a cellular phosphatase activity that,
together with residual PI3KK activity due to incomplete
knockdown, leads to an increase in the steady state level of
cH2AX. One phosphatase candidate is PP2A, which has been
demonstrated to dephosphorylate cH2AX in an ATM-, ATR-,
and DNA-PKcs-independent manner [38]. Polyomavirus small T
antigen is well known for its interaction with PP2A and its ability
to inhibit PP2A enzymatic activity [39]. It will be interesting to
determine the mechanism of cH2AX induction and its functional
significance during BKPyV infection in the future.
What triggers the activation of both the ATM- and ATR￾mediated DDR during BKPyV infection requires more careful
examination. It is possible that a viral protein(s) alone is able to
achieve the induction. For example, expression of SV40 TAg
without a viral replication origin in normal human BJ/tert
fibroblasts induces both an ATM- and ATR-mediated DDR, and
this induction is dependent on the interaction of TAg with Bub1, a
mitotic spindle checkpoint kinase [40]. Moreover, polyomavirus
TAg alone is able to induce cellular DNA damage as judged by
comet assays and cytogenetic analyses [18,41–44]. For JCPyV, the
ability of TAg to associate with cellular DNA is important for TAg
induction of G2 cell cycle arrest [19]. It is also possible that either
incoming or replicating viral genomes serve as the trigger for the
DDR. For example, both wild-type and UV-inactivated AAV2,
but not recombinant AAV2 vectors, are capable of inducing a
DDR, suggesting that it is the viral DNA sequence, but not the
viral capsid, that is responsible for the activation of DDR [37].
In conclusion, our results demonstrate the unique activation of
various DDR components upon BKPyV infection and the
essential roles of both ATM and ATR for viral replication and
growth. The study of BKPyV infection and the DDR not only
reveals novel knowledge about the cellular pathways with which
the virus needs to interact in order to complete the lytic life cycle,
but may also have important clinical implications for BKPyV
reactivation and its related disease. For example, BKPyV
reactivation is a severe problem in bone marrow transplant
patients, who might have experienced radiation as part of the
preparative regimen. Thus, research focusing on BKPyV and
DDR may shed light on the analysis of the causality of BKPyV
reactivation in these patients.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture, viruses, and infections
RPTE cells (Lonza) were maintained in renal epithelial cell
growth medium (REGM) as previously described [45]. All cells
were grown at 37uC with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.
Figure 9. Model of the roles of the DDR during BKPyV infection. (A) Upon BKPyV infection, both the ATM- and ATR-mediated DDR are
activated. ATM mainly contributes to the activation of pChk2, whereas ATR mainly activates pChk1. Both ATM and ATR contribute to BKPyV DNA
replication and infectious progeny production. ATR may also affect the modification status of TAg. Although cH2AX is induced by BKPyV, the
molecular trigger for this induction is unknown. (B) BKPyV infection induces extensive chromosome damage, which is efficiently repaired with the aid
of both ATM and ATR.

BKPyV (Dunlop) was grown, purified, and titered using an
infectious unit (IU) assay as previously described [46]. For
infections, RPTE cells were pre-chilled for 15 min at 4uC. The
cells were then exposed to purified BKPyV diluted in REGM at
the indicated MOIs and incubated for 1 h at 4uC. Infection was
initiated by replacing the viral inoculum with pre-warmed REGM
and transferring the cells to 37uC. Total cell proteins and viral
lysates were harvested as previously described [45].
Drug treatments
UCN-01 (Sigma) was reconstituted according to the manufac￾turer’s recommendations. The drug was added at 1 dpi at 100 nM
and was left on for the time of the experiment. A cell metabolism
WST-1 assay (Roche) was used to ensure that the drug treatment
did not cause significant cytotoxic effects (data not shown).
Western blotting and quantification
Total cell proteins were harvested, quantified, and immuno￾blotted as previously described [46]. For quantitative blots using
the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, the membrane was
processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (LI￾COR). The membrane was scanned using the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging system, and the relevant bands were quantified using the
Odyssey software. See Table S1 for a list of antibodies and
concentrations used in this study.
Cell cycle analysis
Mock or BKPyV-infected cells were trypsinized, resuspended in
PBS, and fixed with 100% cold ethanol. DNA was labeled with
50 mg/ml PI+100 mg/ml RNAse in PBS at room temperature for
30 min. Samples were analyzed with a BD FACSCalibur flow
cytometer and the cell cycle data were modeled using ModFit LT
software.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
At the indicated times post infection, RPTE cells were fixed and
immunostained as previously described [47] with antibodies listed
in Table S1. For standard fluorescence microscopy, samples were
examined using an Olympus BX41 microscope with a Plan 406/
0.65 objective and processed using the Olympus DP manager
software. For laser-scanning confocal microscopy, all images were
obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 636/
1.2 objective and 1 mm optical section. Images were analyzed and
processed using LSM image browser (Zeiss).
siRNA knockdown
siRNA ON-TARGET plus SMART pools were purchased
from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon: Non-targeting (D-001810-
10-05); ATM (L-003201-00-0005); ATR (L-003202-00-0005); and
DNA-PK (L-005030-00-0005). siRNAs were resuspended in 16
siRNA buffer (Dharmacon) to 20 mM stocks. RPTE cells were
reverse transfected with indicated siRNAs using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manu￾facturer’s instructions. siRNAs were diluted in REGM without
serum or antibiotics and mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(2–4 ml per well of a 12 well plate, or 33 ml per T75 flask). The
complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 15 min,
followed by the addition of RPTE cells (60,000 cells per well, or
660,000 cells per flask). The optimal final concentrations of siRNA
were determined empirically. ATM and DNA-PK siRNAs were
used at 10 nM, and ATR siRNA was used at 20 nM. For double
or triple knockdowns, non-targeting siRNAs were added to ensure
that the total concentrations of siRNAs in all the samples were the
same. Transfection complexes were washed out 1 dpt and
replaced with REGM containing serum and antibiotics [45].
The cells were infected with BKPyV at 3 dpt as described above.
For some batches of RPTE cells, siRNA transfection resulted in
uneven cell death among different wells. Under these circum￾stances, cells were trypsinized, counted, and re-plated prior to
infection to ensure that same number of cells were present in all
samples for infection.
Real-time PCR
To quantify the viral DNA load in cells, low molecular weight
DNA was isolated using a modified Hirt protocol [47], real-time
PCR reactions were performed, and data were analyzed as
previously described [47].
Metaphase chromosome preparations
Cells were harvested for chromosome preparations with a
modified protocol [48]. Briefly, cells were treated with colcemid
(50 ng/ml) for 1 h followed by an 18 min incubation in 0.8%
sodium citrate at 37uC and multiple changes of Carnoy’s fixative
(3:1 methanol:acetic acid). Cells were dropped onto slides and
slides were baked overnight at 55uC before staining with Giemsa
(Sigma). Metaphase chromosomes were observed using an
Olympus BX41 microscope with a Plan 1006/1.25 oil objective
or a Nikon OPTIPHOT microscope with a Plan 1006/1.40 oil
objective.
