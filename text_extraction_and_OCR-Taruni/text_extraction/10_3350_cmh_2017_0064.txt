INTRODUCTION 
Gastroesophageal varices (GEVs) are frequent complication of 
liver cirrhosis and a leading cause of mortality in patients with liv￾er cirrhosis. Portal hypertension, which is the most common com￾plication of liver cirrhosis, is the main determinant for develop￾ment of GEVs. Increased intrahepatic vascular resistance to portal 
flow leads to the development of portal hypertension, which is 
aggravated by splanchnic vasodilatation and increase in portal 
blood flow by hyperdynamic circulation.1-3 When the portal pres￾sure increases above a threshold, collaterals develop at the site of 
communication between the portal and systemic circulation.4
 In 
this condition, GEVs are the most important collaterals, and with 
the aggravation of portal hypertension, they grow and eventually 
rupture.5
 Bleeding from GEVs is a major complication of portal hy￾pertension and a leading cause of mortality in patients with liver 
cirrhosis.6,7 Therefore, prevention of variceal development and 
progression, prevention of bleeding from GEV, appropriate man￾agement for acute bleeding from GEV, and prevention of variceal 
rebleeding are critical in patients with liver cirrhosis. Recently, a 
number of studies regarding these topics have been published. 
Therefore, we will review the published results and discuss about 
appropriate management for these patients.
NATURAL HISTORY
In a previous study, GEVs were present in 52.2% of patients 
who performed endoscopy for variceal screening.8
 The incidence 
of GEVs was significantly higher in patients with Child-Pugh class

Bleeding from gastroesophageal varices is a serious complication in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 
Although there has been significance improvement in the prognosis of variceal bleeding with advancement in diagnostic 
and therapeutic modalities for its management, mortality rate still remains high. Therefore, appropriate prevention and 
rapid, effective management of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices is very important. Recently, various studies 
about management of gastoesophageal varices, including prevention of development and aggravation of varices, 
prevention of first variceal bleeding, management of acute variceal bleeding, and prevention of variceal rebleeding, 
have been published. The present article reviews published articles and practice guidelines to present the most optimal 
management of patients with gastroesophageal varices. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2018;24:20-42)

B/C than those with Child-Pugh class A (71.9% vs. 42.7%, 
P=0.02).9
 In another study, varices were present in 37.9% of pa￾tients with liver cirrhosis: 34.7% in patients with compensated 
cirrhosis and 47.9% in those with decompensated cirrhosis.8
The incidences of esophageal varices (EVs) in cirrhotic patients 
without varices at baseline are 5-9% at 1 year, 14-17% at 2 
years, and 21-28% at 3 years.4,10 In another study, cumulative in￾cidence of variceal development over 10 years was 44% in pa￾tients with cirrhosis but without varices at baseline.8
 The main risk 
factor of variceal development in these patients is a hepatic ve￾nous pressure gradient (HVPG) >10 mmHg.4
 Small EVs usually 
progress to large varices and incidence of progression from small to 
large EVs is 12% at 1 year, 25% at 2 years, and 31% at 3 years.10
The independent risk factors of progression of EVs are alcoholic cir￾rhosis, decompensated disease (Child-Pugh class B/C), the presence 
of red color sign at first endoscopy, and splenomegaly.10
The 1-year incidence of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrho￾sis and varices without previous history of bleeding is approxi￾mately 12% (5% for small varices and 15% for large varices) and 
main risk factors of bleeding are larger varices, presence of red 
color signs over the varices, and decompensated disease (Child￾Pugh class B/C).11 In a previous study for the evaluation of the 
natural history of small EVs, the 2-year EV bleeding rate was 12% 
and the presence of red color sign was the only independent risk 
factor.10 Although the mortality rate has been decreased signifi￾cantly during recent several decades with improvement in diag￾nostic and therapeutic modalities for its management,12,13 mortali￾ty rate still remains high as 12-22%.14-16
In addition, rebleeding is very frequent as 60% within 1 year 
without appropriate treatment for the prevention of rebleeding.17
A previous study suggested that HVPG is significantly associated 
with the risk of rebleeding and patients with HVPG >20 mmHg 
within 24 hours of variceal bleeding have higher risk of recurrent 
bleeding within 1 week and higher risk of failure in bleeding con￾trol.18,19
THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS
Pharmacological treatment
Because the splanchnic vasodilatation is the main step in the 
development and progression of portal hypertension, drugs which 
can lead splanchnic vasoconstriction, such as nonselective beta￾blockers (NSBBs), terlipressin, somatostatin, and its analogues 
(octreotide, vapreotide) reduce portal pressure and, currently, 
these drugs are widely used in the management of GEVs. NSBBs, 
such as propranolol and nadolol, reduce portal blood flow 
through β1-blockade (reduction of cardiac output) and β2-
blockade (splanchnic vasoconstriction).20 Various studies suggest￾ed that NSBBs is effective in the prevention of bleeding from EVs 
and recent practice guidelines recommend use of NSBBs for re￾ducing portal pressure, leading to primary and secondary prophy￾laxis against variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and high￾risk EVs.21
Carvedilol is an NSBB, but it has also anti-α1-adrenergic (vaso￾dilator) activity. Therefore, it can reduce portal pressure not only 
by splanchnic vasoconstriction, similar with other NSBBs, but also 
by intrahepatic vasodilation and reduction of intrahepatic pres￾sure. HVPG reduction by carvedilol is significantly greater than by 
other NSBBs, propranolol or nadolol, in a systemic review.22 How￾ever, it also induce more significant decreases in arterial pressure. 
The optimal dose is 12.5 mg once a day because higher doses 
have no additional benefit in HVPG with higher reduction of arte￾rial pressure.23,24 Although several studies evaluated the efficacy 
of carvedilol in the primary and secondary prophylaxis against 
variceal bleeding, results are conflicting.
Recent studies suggested that simvastatin enhances endothelial 
nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity and up-regulates NO produc￾tion, which in turn, leads intrahepatic vasodilatation and decrease 
in portal pressure.25,26 However, the effect on the GEVs of simvas￾tatin is unclear.
Endoscopic treatment
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) is a procedure injecting 
sclerosant such as ethanolamine oleate, tetradecyl sulphate, or 
absolute alcohol directly into varices or surrounding areas of vari￾ces. Injected sclerosant induces endothelial damage and throm￾bosis of varices resulting in sclerosis and resolution of varices. EIS 
have been applied to the management of esophageal variceal 
bleeding since the mid-1970s.27 However, EIS has some complica￾tions such as pulmonary edema, renal failure, esophageal ulcer￾ation, stricture, perforation, and variceal rebleeding.28,29 As endo￾scopic band ligation (EBL) showed improved survival, decreased 
risk of rebleeding, and less adverse effects,30,31 EBL has replaced 
EIS as the first-line treatment in the manage of esophageal varice￾al bleeding.31-34
Nowadays, EBL is considered as the endoscopic treatment of 
choice for the hemostasis and prophylaxis of bleeding from EVs 

22 http://www.e-cmh.org

because of the superior effectiveness and safety compared to 
EIS.35-37 In addition, EBL require fewer treatment sessions to 
achieve variceal obliteration, lower rebleeding rates, and fewer 
complications compared to EIS.37 In EBL procedure, rubber band 
captures all or part of varices, followed by occlusion from throm￾bosis. Then, variceal tissue necrosis, leaving a superficial mucosal 
ulceration. As EBL does not use sclerosant, it rarely damages deep 
esophageal wall. Also, EBL promotes the development gastric col￾laterals, because collateral vessels near the cardia decreases after 
EBL.38,39 EBL should be repeated every 2-4 weeks until variceal 
eradication is achieved, which is usually defined as the disappear￾ance of varices or decrease in size to grade 1 and too small for 
EBL without red color sign. Because of high recurrence rate of 
varices after eradication by EBL, indefinite endoscopic monitoring 
to detect recurrence of high-risk varices is recommended. High re￾currence rate after eradication by EBL could be explained of its 
nature, only act by mechanical strangulation without any effect 
on portal hypertension. However, recurrence rate after EBL is sig￾nificantly higher than after EIS, although both procedures are lo￾cal therapies.40,41 It is probably because the two procedures differ 
in their mechanism of action. In EBL, the effect of EBL effect is 
usually limited to the mucosa and submucosa, while perforating 
veins between the paraesophageal veins and submucosal veins 
are preserved. In contrast, EIS eradicates EVs through a chemical 
reaction that leads to fibrosis; the effects of EIS extend into the 
deeper layers, obliterating the perforating veins. EV recurrence is 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and it is therefore 
crucial that patients be monitored closely after treatment for EVs.
Endoscopic variceal obturation (EVO) has been reported to be 
effective in the treatment of acute bleeding from gastric varices 
(GVs) and prevention of GV rebleeding.42-45 Cyanoacrylate is a 
monomer that rapidly undergoes polymerization when it contacts 
with the hydroxyl ions which present in water. The double bonds 
present in the monomer become single bonds, causing them to 
link together in enormous chains, changing from liquid to a hard 
acrylic plastic material. Cyanoacrylate is usually mixed with lipi￾odol in 1:1 ratio. Cyanoacrylate glue is injected directly into the 
gastric varix,46 then polymerizes rapidly and plugs the lumen of 
varices, resulting in hemostasis of variceal bleeding. The needle 
should be withdrawn immediately after the injection to prevent its 
impaction into the tissue. Injection could be repeated until the 
varix is hard to palpation with a catheter or biopsy forceps. Glue 
cast is usually extruded into the stomach within 1-3 months after 
injection.47 Adhesive agent gradually induces imflammatory re￾sponse and elimination of vascular endothelial cells, leading to 
resolution of varices. EVO is associated with complications such 
as infection, fever, perforation, gastric ulcer, damage to the endo￾scope, and peritonitis. Moreover, it has a risk of embolization, es￾pecially when insufficient amount of cyanoacrylate was injected 
in varices, followed by leakage into collateral vessels to other ma￾jor organs.48-52
Radiologic treatment
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a proce￾dure that establish a direct pathway between the hepatic vein and 
the portal vein by inserting stent to decompress the portal hyper￾tension. By lowering portal pressure, TIPS manages variceal 
bleeding via reducing variceal blood flow, and also controls other 
complications caused by portal hypertension. The efficacy of TIPS 
in the treatment of gastric variceal bleeding refractory to endo￾scopic therapy and prophylaxis for variceal rebleeding has been re￾ported in a recent meta-analysis.53 Success rate, procedure-related 
mortality, 30-day mortality of TIPS procedure, ranged from 93-
100%, 0-2%, 3-15%, respectively.54-60 The major disadvantage af￾ter TIPS procedure is variceal rebleeding caused by obliteration or 
stenosis of shunt. To prevent rebleeding of varices, hepatic venous 
pressure gradient should be controlled lower than 12 mmHg,61 and 
routine surveillance tests using ultrasound with doppler should be 
done even in asymptomatic patients.62 The TIPS may lead to other 
adverse events. Technical complications at procedure including 
transcapsular puncture and extrahepatic portal vein puncture 
were reported.62 Deterioration of hepatic function and develop￾ment or aggravation of hepatic encephalopathy (25-30%) may 
occur after TIPS.54 Most cases are relieved by medical therapy, 
however, encephalopathy is refractory to conservative treatment 
in 3-7%, decreasing diameter of shunt by inserting coil or vascular 
plug into stent, or stent graft might be needed.63 In addition, as 
central venous pressure is elevated by increased systemic blood 
flow through porto-systemic shunt, patients with right sided heart 
failure, severe pulmonary hypertension, and severe tricuspid re￾gurgitation are contraindicated to TIPS. Primary prevention of var￾iceal bleeding, unrelieved biliary obstruction are also absolute 
contraindications of TIPS.62 In last decades, polytetrafluoroethyl￾ene (PTFE)–covered stents have been introduced, resulting in 
marked improvement of long-term shunt patency compared to 
bare metal stent. Recent studies have reported higher rate of pa￾tency and lower rate of hepatic encephalopathy with PTFE-cov￾ered stent.64,65
Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) is

an interventional radiologic technique used for bleeding gastric 
varices and ectopic varices.66 BRTO procedure is to induce throm￾botic obliteration of gastric varices by injecting an endovascular 
sclerosant such as ethanolamine oleate in to the gastric varices 
through the gastrorenal or gastrocaval shunt while variceal blood 
flow is stopped by retrograde balloon occlusion.67-70 Gastric vari￾ces frequently have a spontaneous gastrorenal shunt account as a 
main draining vein, however, approximately 15% of patients with 
GVs have other various portosystemic venous pathways, such as 
the left inferior phrenic, pericardiac, and azygous-hemiazygous 
veins and BRTO is not available in these patients.71-74 BRTO has an 
important advantage over other treatments. As BRTO has poten￾tial of increasing portal blood flow, it can be performed in pa￾tients with impaired hepatic function and hepatic encephalopa￾thy.68,71,75 However, increased portal venous pressure after BRTO 
would induce aggravation of esophageal varices and increased 
ascites. The risk for worsening of esophageal varices after BRTO 
was reported to be 24.9-58% at 3 years.72,76,77 Therefore, follow￾up endoscopy is required following BRTO. Adverse events, such as 
abdominal pain, back pain, and low grade fever, are often ob￾served during or after BRTO.78 Also, BRTO has several complica￾tions related to EO such as hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, pulmonary 
edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anaphylactic re￾action, and even severe renal dysfunction.69,79 Reported success 
rates of BRTO has been 87-100%, the relapse rate of varices is 
0-10%.68,70-72,75,76,80
Recently, plug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration 
(PARTO) was proposed as modified BRTO to minimize complica￾tions of BRTO, associated with the use of sclerosant and balloon 
indwelling.68,81-89 In PARTO, balloon occlusion catheter and scle￾rosant are replaced with a vascular plug/coils and gelatin 
sponge.90-92 Recent studies reported 100% of technical success 
rate and 98.6% of clinical success rate of PARTO in thrombosis of 
the gastrorenal shunt and GVs.90,93 Procedure-related complica￾tions, rebleeding of GVs or hepatic encephalopathy was not found 
in observation period. PARTO has several advantages. First, PAR￾TO prevents procedure-related complications and decreases the 
procedure time, because vascular plug and gelatin sponge can 
promote rapid and complete embolizations without complica￾tions.91,94 Second, as PARTO does not use sclerosants, it does not 
require selective embolization of efferent veins in most cases. 
However, PARTO also has potential worsening of EVs and ascites 
like BRTO. EVs were newly developed in 10% of patients who did 
not have EVs before PARTO, and progressed in 16.7% of patients 
who had EVs before PARTO. Ascites was newly appeared in 15% 
of patients who did not have ascites before PARTO, and pro￾gressed to larger amount in 8.3% of patients who had ascites be￾fore PARTO.
PREVENTION OF VARICEAL DEVELOPMENT 
AND PROGRESSION
Because development of GEVs is a direct consequence of portal 
hypertension, reduction of portal pressure by NSBBs from the ear￾ly stage of liver cirrhosis might ameliorate the development of 
GEVs. Similarly, several animal studies suggested that early ad￾ministration of NSBBs reduced the development of porto-systemic 
shunting.95,96
A previous placebo-controlled study evaluated whether NSBBs 
could prevent the development of varices in 213 patients with cir￾rhosis and portal hypertension without GEVs.4
 Patients were ran￾domized to receive timolol (n=108) or placebo (n=105) and the 
mean follow-up duration was 54.9 months. The rate of primary 
end-point, the development of varices or bleeding from varices, 
did not differ between two groups (39% vs. 40%, P=0.89), while 
the incidence of serious adverse events was significantly higher in 
the timilol group than the placebo group (18% vs. 6%, P=0.006).4
Therefore, current practice guidelines do not recommend the use 
of NSBBs for the prevention of the development of varices.21
Several studies evaluated whether NSBBs could prevent or delay 
the growth of small varices, but the results are controversial. One 
study showed a significant reduction of the progression to large 
EVs in the nadolol group compared to the placebo group in pa￾tients with cirrhosis and small EVs (7% vs. 31% at 2 years, 20% 
vs. 51% at 5 years; P<0.001),97 while another study showed no 
benefit of propranolol for the prevention of progression to large 
varices (23% in the propranolol group vs. 19% in the placebo 
group, P=0.786) although reduction of portal pressure was sig￾nificantly greater in the propranolol group.98 A recent meta-analy￾sis suggested that NSBBs are not effective in preventing the pro￾gression of small to large varices.99 Therefore, further studies are 
required to confirm to start NSBBs at this stage. A recent study 
showed that the incidence of progression to large varices was sig￾nificantly lower in the carvedilol group than the placebo group 
during 24 months (20.6% vs. 38.6%, P=0.04) and they suggested 
that carvedilol is safe and effective in delaying the progression of 
small to large EVs in patients with cirrhosis.100
The main treatment target of the action of NSBBs is a splanch￾nic vasoconstriction to ameliorate the hyperdynamic circulation 

24 http://www.e-cmh.org

and reduce portal pressure. Therefore, NSBBs might be more ef￾fective in patients with moderate or severe splanchnic vasodilata￾tion with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; defined 
as ≥10 mmHg of HVPG) and hyperdynamic circulation, while 
those might be ineffective in patients with an early-stage cirrhosis 
when splanchnic vasodilatation is not developed yet or its severity 
is very mild. In a previous study of patients with 273 patients with 
cirrhosis without any previous decompensation, without EVs or 
with small varices without red signs, the response to NSBBs was 
significantly greater in patients with CSPH than those with sub￾clinical portal hypertension (HVPG >5 and <10 mmHg).101 There￾fore, negative results of NSBBs in the previously mentioned stud￾ies might be due to the inclusion of patients with an early-stage 
liver cirrhosis. While, carvedilol reduce portal pressure by the anti￾α1-mediated decrease in intrahepatic resistance as well as 
splanchnic vasoconstriction.102 Because the intrahepatic vasocon￾striction is the main pathologic mechanism of the development of 
portal hypertension in the early-stage liver cirrhosis, it could be 
more effective in the prevention of progression of varices in pa￾tients with an early-stage cirrhosis.
MANAGEMENT OF ESOPHAGEAL VARICES
Primary prophylaxis
Because of the poor prognosis in patients with variceal bleed￾ing, current guidelines recommend primary prophylaxis against VB 
in patients with high risk of bleeding. Patients with high risk of 
bleeding consist of patients with medium/large varices, those with 
small varices with red color signs, and those with decompensated 
liver disease and small varices.11
Recommended modalities for primary prophylaxis against VB 
are NSBBs or EBL. In times past, isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) 
was considered as a potential drug for primary prophylaxis, be￾cause of its ability of significant reduction of portal pressure.103
However, in a subsequent trial comparing ISMN with propranolol, 
although incidence of VB did not differ between two groups, 
mortality rate was significantly higher in the ISMN group (72% vs. 
48%, P=0.006).104 Therefore, ISMN is not recommended as 
monotherapy in primary prophylaxis. Various studies and meta￾analyses confirmed that NSBBs is superior to no therapy or place￾bo in preventing first VB.99,105-108 However, the effect on mortality 
of NSBBs in this setting is controversial.99,105-108 In a previous meta￾analysis, EBL reduce the risk of first VB (relative risk [RR], 0.36; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.50) and mortality (RR, 0.55; 
95% CI, 0.43-0.71) compared to no treatment.109 While, in this 
meta-analysis, although EBL reduce the risk of first VB (RR, 0.48; 
95% CI, 0.24-0.96), there was no difference in mortality (RR, 
0.95; 95% CI, 0.56-1.62) when compared with NSBBs.109 Similarly, 
the efficacy of EBL for the prevention of first variceal bleeding was 
similar with or superior to NSBBs without any differences in mor￾tality in other meta-analyses.110-113
Therefore, current practice guidelines recommend that either 
NSBBs or EBL for the prevention of the first variceal bleeding in 
patients with medium or large varices and the choice of treatment 
should be based on local resources and expertise, patient prefer￾ence and characteristics, contraindications, and adverse events.21
The advantages of NSBBs are their low cost, ease of administra￾tion, no need for specific expertise, and no need for endoscopic 
monitoring. In addition, because NSBBs reduce the risk of first 
variceal bleeding by reducing the portal pressure, these drugs may 
prevent other complications of portal hypertension, such as asci￾tes, SBP, and encephalopathy.114,115 The disadvantages of NSBBs 
are that around 15% of patients have contraindications and an￾other 15-20% experience unpleasant side effects, such as short￾ness of breath, lethargy, fatigue, and pre-syncope, which require 
dose reduction or discontinuation.116 Furthermore, 25-40% of pa￾tients do not achieve a sufficient hemodynamic response for re￾duction of portal pressure and prevention of first variceal bleed￾ing.117-119 In addition, treatment with NSBB need for lifelong 
therapy and the risk of variceal bleeding increases after the cessa￾tion of therapy.120 The advantages of EBL are that it can be done 
in the same session as screening endoscopy and has few contra￾indications. In addition, the side effects are less frequent. A previ￾ous meta-analysis suggested that adverse events were associated 
with EBL in 42.7% and with NSBBs in 56.1%.113 While, the disad￾vantages of EBL are need for specific expertise and potential risk 
for lethal bleeding from post-procedure ulcers.20 It is usually con￾sidered that even the frequency of adverse events is significantly 
lower with EBL, the severity of adverse events is greater with EBL. 
A previous meta-analysis suggested that fatal adverse events 
were significantly lower with NSBBs (RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02-
0.99).121 In addition, because EBL is a local therapy, it could not 
affect portal hypertension and could not prevent other complica￾tions by portal hypertension.122 Lastly, because recurrence rate af￾ter eradication by EBL is very high, periodic surveillance endo￾scopic follow-up is needed to detect recurrence of high-risk 
varices.115 A recent study evaluated the predicted preferences of 
patients and physicians for the primary prevention of variceal

bleeding and 64% of patients and 57% of physicians preferred 
EBL over NSBBs.123
Theoretically, the combination of direct mechanical obliteration 
of varices by EBL and reduction of portal pressure by NSBBs would 
have a synergistic effect and would be more effective than either 
treatment alone. There have been several randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs)124-127 to compared the efficacy for primary prophylaxis 
between single treatment and combined treatment: two of them 
compared the efficacy of combined treatment with EBL alone124,125
and two RCTs compared combined treatment and NSBB 
alone.126,127 In two RCTs that compared combined treatment and 
EBL alone,124,125 the incidence of first variceal bleeding and mortal￾ity rate did not differ between two groups, while the incidence of 
variceal recurrence after eradication by EBL was significantly lower 
in the combined treatment group compared to EBL alone 
group.124,125 In the study by Sarin et al, the incidence of variceal 
bleeding (7% vs. 11%, P=0.72) and mortality rate (8% vs. 15%, 
P=0.37) within 20 months did not differ between combined treat￾ment group and EBL only group, while the proportions of patients 
who achieved variceal eradication by EBL and those who achieved 
target heart rate or HVPG reduction were not provided and 11.8% 
of enrolled patients had noncirrhotic portal hypertension.124 Simi￾larly, the incidence of variceal bleeding (3% vs. 6%, P=1.0) and 
mortality rate (12% vs. 6%, P=0.27) within 1 year did not differ 
between two groups in another study by Bonilha et al.125 Variceal 
eradication rate was 100% in this study, while the number of in￾cluded patients was relatively small (32 patients in the EBL group 
and 34 patients in the combined group).125 Among two RCTs com￾paring combined treatment and NSBB alone, one study suggest￾ed, that the incidence of variceal bleeding (14% vs. 13%, P=0.90) 
and mortality rate (22.9% vs. 21.4%, P=0.22) did not differ be￾tween two groups,126 while variceal eradication rate was 71%, 
which was relatively lower than previous studies.113 In another 
RCT that comparing combined treatment and NSBB alone, al￾though the incidence of VB was significantly lower in the com￾bined treatment group compared to NSBB alone group (6% vs. 
31%, P=0.03),127 this study has major limitations of too small 
sample size and high incidence of variceal bleeding in the NSBB 
alone group. Thus, because most of studies showed no significant 
benefit of combined treatment compared with single treatment, 
current guidelines do not recommend combined treatment for pri￾mary prophylaxis. However, very recently, a large scale multicenter 
RCT was presented at the International Liver Congress of the Euro￾pean Association for the Study of the Liver on April, 2017.128 In this 
study, 290 cirrhotic patients with medium or large varices with red 
color sign without previous history of bleeding were randomized 
propranolol alone, EBL alone, and combined treatment. The propor￾tions of patients who achieved EV eradication by EBL and who 
achieved target heart rate by propranolol were 84.1% and 77.7%, 
respectively. The incidence of variceal bleeding was significantly 
lower in the combined treatment group (3.4%) compared to the 
propranolol alone group (14%, P=0.012) and EBL alone group 
(14.9%, P=0.008) without difference in mortality rate within 2 
years. In addition, numbers of EBL sessions and used rubber bands 
for EV eradication and EV recurrence rate after eradication by EBL 
were significantly lower in the combined treatment group in this 
study.128 Because this well-designed large-scale RCT showed supe￾riority of combined treatment for the primary prophylaxis, revision 
of recommendation of practice guidelines should be considered.
There have been several studies that evaluated the efficacy of 
carvedilol for the primary prophylaxis.24,129,130 In one RCT, the inci￾dence of variceal bleeding was significantly lower in the carvedilol 
group than in the EBL group (13.4% vs. 24% within 24 months, 
P=0.04) without difference in mortality (28.5% vs. 27.9%% with￾in 24 months, P=0.71).129 However, main limitations of this study 
are too low rate of achievement of variceal eradication (58%) and 
relatively higher rate of bleeding in the EBL group compared to 
other previous studies.113 While, in another RCT, the incidence of 
variceal bleeding (8.5% vs. 6.9% within 24 months, P=0.61) and 
mortality rate (19.5% vs. 12.8% within 24 months, P=0.23) did 
not differ between carvedilol and EBL groups.130 In this study, vari￾ceal eradication was achieved in 75% of the EBL group, which is 
also slightly lower than other previous studies. In a previous meta￾analysis, variceal eradication rate by EBL was 91.6%.113 In these 
two studies, hemodynamic response was not evaluated by HVPG 
measurement.129,130 A recent study evaluated the effect of 
carvedilol in patients with hemodynamic non-response to pro￾pranolol.24 In this study, patients with EVs and HVPG >12 mmHg 
were treated with propranolol. After 4 weeks of propranolol treat￾ment, HVPG measurement was repeated to evaluate the hemody￾namic response to propranolol. Hemodynamic responders (de￾crease in HVPG ≥20% from baseline or to <12 mmHg) to 
propranolol were kept on propranolol, while hemodynamic non￾responders were switched to carvedilol. After 4 weeks of 
carvedilol treatment, HVPG measurement was repeated, and he￾modynamic responders to carvedilol were kept on carvedilol, 
while carvedilol non-responders underwent EBL until variceal 
eradication. Hemodynamic responders to propranolol was 36% of 
all enrolled patients and 56% of propranolol non-responders 
achieved hemodynamic response to carvedilol. Incidence of vari-

ceal bleeding was significantly lower in the hemodynamic re￾sponders to propranolol (11%) or carvedilol (8%) than EBL-treated 
patients within 2 years (24%, P=0.043).24 However, because this 
study included patients according to the HVPG (>12 mmHg) rath￾er than to the size of EVs, 39% of enrolled patients have small 
sized EVs. Therefore, significant proportion of patients might not 
be indicated for primary prophylaxis. In addition, similar with the 
study by Tripathi et al.,129 the incidence of VB in EBL group was 
higher than other previous studies.113 In summary, carvedilol could 
be added to the treatment options of primary prophylaxis, while 
superiority of carvedilol to EBL or to other NSBBs has not been 
confirmed yet. Carvedilol could be a good option in patients with 
high-risk EVs and intolerance or non-response to other NSBBs 
such as propranolol and nadolol.
Management of acute variceal bleeding
Although there has been significant improvement in survival of 
patients with acute variceal bleeding during several decades, 
mortality rate still remains high as 12-22%.14-16 Therefore, prompt 
and appropriate management is important in patients with acute 
variceal bleeding. The mainstay of the management of patients 
with acute variceal bleeding includes resuscitation, pharmacologi￾cal treatment, and endoscopic treatment.
General management
In patients with acute bleeding of any cause, the first and most 
important step is the initial resuscitation for protection of the cir￾culatory and respiratory status of the patient. Volume replacement 
should be initiated to restore and maintain hemodynamic stability. 
Regarding the packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion, a recent 
RCT showed a deleterious effect of over-transfusion.131 In this 
study, 889 patients with UGI bleeding was randomized to restric￾tive transfusion group (initiating PRBC transfusion at a hemoglo￾bin threshold of 7 g/dL and maintaining it at 7-9 g/dL) and the lib￾eral transfusion group (initiating PRBC transfusion at a 
hemoglobin threshold of 9 g/dL and maintaining it at 9-11 g/dL). 
Mortality rate (5% vs. 9%, P=0.02) and the incidence of serious 
adverse events (12% vs. 18%, P=0.01) were significantly lower in 
the restrictive transfusion group. In the subgroup analysis of pa￾tients with bleeding from GEV (220 patients, 23.6%), there was a 
trend of lower hemostasis failure rate (11% vs. 22%, P=0.05) and 
mortality rate (11% vs. 18%, P=0.08) in the restrictive transfusion 
group: mortality rate was significantly lower in the restrictive 
transfusion group among patients with Child-Pugh class A/B (4% 
vs. 12%, P=0.02), while it did not differ between two groups 
among patients with Child-Pugh class C (38% vs. 41%, P=0.91). 
Improved survival in the restrictive transfusion group might be re￾lated to the reduced hemostasis failure and serious adverse events. 
Previous studies suggested that transfusion may counteract the 
splanchnic vasoconstrictive response caused by hypovolemia and, 
in turn, impair the formation of clots by increase in splanchnic 
blood flow and pressure.132,133 In addition, transfusion may induce 
coagulation abnormalties.134,135 Furthermore, restitution of blood 
volume by transfusion can induce rebound increase in portal pres￾sure.136,137 Consistently, in 151 patients with bleeding from GEV who 
performed HVPG measurement at baseline and repeated at 2-3 
days later, HVPG was significantly decreased in the restrictive 
transfusion group (from 20.5±3.1 mmHg to 21.4±4.3 mmHg, 
P=0.03), while there was no significant change in the liberal trans￾fusion group, despite they were treated with intravenous soma￾tostatin.131 Therefore, recent guidelines recommend PRBC transfu￾sion at a target hemoglobin level between 7 and 9 g/dL.21,115
There have been insufficient evidences supporting the routine 
use of clotting factors or platelet transfusion to improve hemosta￾sis rate, prevent rebleeding and development of hepatic encepha￾lopathy. In a recent meta-analysis, recombinant factor VIIa treat￾ment reduced the 5-day treatment failure rate (17% vs. 26%, 
P=0.049) with a potential increased risk of arterial thrombo-em￾bolic events in patients with EV bleeding.138
Bacterial infection is frequent in cirrhotic patients with upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding139,140 and it is associated with an in￾creased rate of failure to control bleeding,139,141 rebleeding,142 and 
hospital mortality.141 A recent meta-analysis showed that prophy￾lactic antibiotics during an acute variceal bleeding reduce the risks 
of mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.98), mortality from bacte￾rial infections (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19-0.97), bacterial infections 
(RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.47), and rebleeding (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 
0.38-0.74).143 While, another recent study questioned about the 
usefulness of the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in Child￾Pugh class A patients with acute variceal bleeding because of very 
low rate of infection (2%) and mortality (0.4%) in the absence of 
antibiotics.144 However, this study was a retrospective analysis144
and there were no prospective studies that evaluated the useful￾ness of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients. Therefore, current 
guidelines recommend routine prophylactic antibiotics in all cir￾rhotic patients presenting variceal bleeding regardless of Child￾Pugh class.21,115 In a previous RCT which compared intravenous 
ceftriaxone (1 g/day) and oral norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily) in 
the prophylaxis of bacterial infection in cirrhotic patients with GI

bleeding, incidences of proved or possible infections (11% vs. 
33%, P=0.003), proved infections (11% vs. 26%, P=0.03), spon￾taneous bacteremia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (12% vs. 
2%, P=0.03) were significantly lower in the ceftriaxone group.145
However, this study included only patients with advanced cirrhosis 
(at least 2 of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encepha￾lopathy, or bilirubin >3 mg/dL),145 these results could not be ap￾plied to patients with variceal bleeding and less advanced cirrho￾sis. In addition, considering that 6 of 7 gram-negative bacilli in 
the norfloxacin group were quinolone resistant, most of the supe￾riority of ceftriaxone was explained by a higher rate of infections 
by quinolone-resistant organisms.145 Therefore, selection of pro￾phylactic antibiotics should be based on local resistance patterns. 
Current guidelines recommend short-term (maximum 7 days) in￾travenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h as the best prophylactic antibiotics 
in patients with variceal bleeding.21,115
Pharmacological treatment
Vasoactive drugs, such as vasopressin, terlipressin, somatosta￾tin, and octreotide, are effective in hemostasis in patients with 
acute variceal bleeding by reducing portal pressure. Vasopressin 
reduces portal blood flow, portal systemic collateral blood flow, 
and intra-variceal pressure by induction of systemic and splanch￾nic vasoconstriction. However, due to the significant side effects 
including an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and reduc￾tion in cardiac output and coronary blood flow, it is not recom￾mended in these days. The addition of nitroglycerine to vasopres￾sin reduces in hemostasis failure and cardiovascular side 
effects.107,146 Terlipressin, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, is 
also effective in the reduction of portal pressure and hemostasis 
of acute variceal bleeding. Among all kinds of vasoactive drugs, 
terlipressin is the only drug which has been proven to reduce mor￾tality (RR=0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.88),147 while the efficacies for 
bleeding control and survival did not differ among terlipressin, so￾matostatin, and octreotide in another meta-analysis148 and a re￾cent large-scale RCT.14 Therefore, there is no preference when se￾lecting one of several vasoactive drugs. Somatostatin reduces 
portal pressure and portal blood flow by induction of selective 
splanchnic vasoconstriction.149 A meta-analysis showed that so￾matostatin and its analogue, octreotide, are as effective as terlip￾ressin in patients with acute variceal bleeding.148 In a recent meta￾analysis, the use of vasoactive drugs in patients with acute 
variceal bleeding was associated with a significant reduction in 
7-day mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95) and significant in￾crease in hemostasis rate (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13-1.30).148 There￾fore, these drugs should be started as soon as possible, before 
endoscopy, in patients in whom VB is suspected.21,115 In patients 
with acute variceal bleeding, it is recommended that vasoactive 
drugs should be continued for 3-5 days,21,115 while, in a previous 
RCT, 30-day rebleeding (3.1% vs. 1.5%, P=0.50) and 30-day 
mortality (9.2% vs. 9.2%, P=0.50) did not differ between 24 
hours and 72 hours of the duration of terlipressin treatment in pa￾tients with successful hemostrasis by EBL without advanced cir￾rhosis (Child-Pugh score ≥12).150 In a previous study, serum sodi￾um level was reduced ≥5 mEq/L in 67% and >10 mEq/L in 36% 
of cirrhotic patients during terlipressin treatment.151 Therefore, so￾dium level should be monitored during terlipressin treatment.21
Higher baseline serum Na level,151,152 lower Child-Pugh or MELD 
score,151,152 and lower body mass index152 were associated with the 
development of terlipressin-induced hyponatremia.
Endoscopic treatment
Endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible to evaluate 
the source of bleeding. If a source of bleeding is confirmed as var￾iceal bleeding, endoscopic treatment should be performed. EBL is 
the endoscopic treatment of choice for patients of acute bleeding 
from EVs and should be performed when EVs are confirmed or 
suspected as a source of bleeding on endoscopy. EIS is no longer 
recommended as standard treatment for acute bleeding from EVs 
because of higher incidence of treatment failure, mortality, and 
adverse events compared to EBL. A meta-analysis showed EBL re￾duced incidences of rebleeding (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.78), 
mortality (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.98), and esophageal stric￾tures (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.29).153 EBL should be combined 
with vasoactive drugs. A previous meta-analysis showed that 
combination of endoscopic treatment (EIS or EBL) and vasoactive 
drugs improved initial hemostasis (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.23) 
and reduced early rebleeding within 5 days (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 
1.18-1.39) compared to endoscopic treatment alone.154 EVO is not 
recommended for the treatment of bleeding from EVs because 
EVO showed no difference in the hemostasis rate, higher rebleed￾ing rate, and potential risk of systemic embolization.155
Regarding the optimal time for endoscopy in patients with sus￾pected variceal bleeding, most guidelines recommend that endos￾copy should be performed within 12 hours of presentation,21,115
while there is no evidence to support this time limitation. A previ￾ous retrospective study suggested that delayed endoscopy (>15 
hours after admission) was one of the independent risk factors of 
in-hospital mortality.156 Similarly, in a prospective observational 
study, 6-week rebleeding rate (18.9% vs. 38.9%, P=0.028) and 

28 http://www.e-cmh.org

https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2017.0064
mortality (27% vs. 52.8%, P=0.031) were lower in patients with 
early endoscopy (≤12 hours) than those with delayed endoscopy 
(>12 hours).157 However, because these two studies were not per￾formed as randomized controlled design, many confounding fac￾tors might have influenced the results, such as the unstable he￾modynamics which could cause delayed endoscopy as well as 
poor prognosis. Therefore, optimal timing of endoscopy in pa￾tients with suspected variceal bleeding could not be confirmed 
until a large-scale RCT would be performed. In another retrospec￾tive study, time of endoscopy was not associated with prognosis 
in patients who present with hemodynamically stable variceal 
bleeding.158
Early TIPS in high-risk patients
TIPS has been considered as a salvage treatment in patients 
with VB who failed control of bleeding. However, recent studies 
suggested that early TIPS is useful in patients with bleeding from 
EVs and high-risk of treatment failure.19,159 In one study, early TIPS 
(within 24 hours after admission) significantly reduced treatment 
failure (12% vs. 50%, P<0.001), in-hospital mortality (11% vs. 
38%, P<0.02), and 1-year mortality (11% vs. 31%, P<0.05) in 
high-risk EV bleeding patients.19 In this trial, EIS was used as stan￾dard endoscopic treatment,19 which is not recommended as stan￾dard treatment. Consistently, early TIPS (within 72 hours after 
randomization) significantly reduced treatment failure (3% vs. 
45%, P=0.001) and 1-year mortality (14% vs. 39%, P<0.001) in 
another study.159 In both studies, early TIPS did not increase the 
risk of hepatic encephalopathy.19,159 However, as followed obser￾vational studies could not confirmed beneficial effect on survival 
of early TIPS,160,161 further studies are needed to confirm the role 
of early TIPS in patients with high-risk patients. In addition, rees￾tablishment of the criteria of the high-risk patients is also need￾ed.21 Actually, different definitions of high-risk patients were used 
in two previous RCTs: it was defined as HVPG >20 mmHg in one 
study19 and as Child-Pugh class cirrhosis with a score 10-13 and 
those with Child-Pugh class B with active bleeding on endoscopy 
despite intravenous vasoactive drug therapy in another study.159
These definitions have no evidence and it has been suggested 
that these criteria may overestimate the risk of treatment failure in 
some patients: patients with Child-Pugh class B treated with the 
standard care for EV bleeding usually have better prognosis than 
those with Child-Pugh class C.162,163
Management of patients with failure to hemostasis
Placement of TIPS is considered a best salvage therapy for pa￾tients with standard treatment failure. In previous studies, salvage 
TIPS achieved control of bleeding in 90-100% with low rebleed￾ing rates of 6-16%.164 Balloon tamponade is effective in control of 
acute EV bleeding in up to 90% of cases, while rebleeding rate 
after deflation is high as about 50%.165,166 In addition, because it 
is associated with serious complications such as esophageal ulcer￾ation, esophageal rupture, and aspiration pneumonia,167 the 
placement of balloon tamponade should not exceed 24-48 
hours.167 Therefore, balloon tamponade is usually used as a bridge 
to more definitive therapy, such as TIPS. A recent small RCT sug￾gested a self-expandable, esophageal covered metal stent as an 
alternative to balloon tamponade.168 In this study, primary end￾point, defined as survival to day 15, control of bleeding, and ab￾sence of serious adverse events, was more frequently achieved in 
the stent group (66% vs. 20%, P=0.025) with higher rates of he￾mostasis (85% vs. 47%, P=0.025) without improvement in sur￾vival in 28 patients with EVB refractory to standard medical and 
endoscopic treatment.168 This stent can be placed endoscopically 
without radiological guidance and removable. In addition, it can 
stay in place for up to 2 weeks.
Secondary prophylaxis
In patients who survive an acute variceal bleeding, varices re￾bleed in 60% in the first year with high mortality rate of up to 
33%.122 Therefore, appropriate treatment for the prevention of 
variceal rebleeding is very important.
NSBBs are the first drug that has been used for prevention of 
variceal rebleeding and various studies showed significant reduc￾tion of rebleeding rate with NSBBs compared to the placebo.169-171
The combination of ISMN and NSBBs enhances the portal pres￾sure-reducing effect.172 However, the addition of ISMN increases 
the frequency of side effects such as headache and lightheaded￾ness. In a previous RCT to compare the efficacy of ISMN+PPL and 
PPL alone, rebleeding was significantly lower in the ISMN+NSBB 
group (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.95), while the incidence of dis￾continuation by adverse events was also higher in this group 
(15.2% vs. 2.0%, P=0.03).173 However, rebleeding rate did not 
differ between two groups with a higher rate of side effects in the 
ISMN+NSBB group in a meta-analysis.174 This combined drug 
therapy has been shown to be superior to EIS. In a previous RCT, 
the incidences of rebleeding (25% vs. 55% within 2 years, 
P=0.002) and treatment-related complications (16.3% vs. 37.2%) 
were significantly lower in the ISMN+NSBB group compared to 
the EIS group without difference in survival rate.175 Compared to 
EBL, the rebleeding rate was higher176 or not different111,177 with

this combined drug therapy in meta-analyses. Mortality rate was 
significantly higher in the ISMN+NSBB group (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 
1.01-1.55) in one meta-analysis,111 while it did not differ between 
two groups (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.08) in another meta-analy￾sis.177 In a long-term follow-up study, ISMN+NSBB treatment 
showed lower mortality rate (30% vs. 49%, P=0.013), while re￾bleeding rate was higher in this group (64% vs. 30%, P=0.001) 
compared to the EBL group.178 Addition of these combined drug 
therapy to the EBL did not reduce the rebleeding rate compared 
to the EBL alone in a RCT (27% vs. 31% within 2 years, 
P=0.822)179 and meta-analysis (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.08).176
Similarly, rebleeding rate did not dif fer bet ween the 
ISMN+NSBB+EBL group and ISMN+NSBB group in the previous 
RCTs180,181 and a meta-analysis (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56-1.03).176
Until EBL is used for the treatment of GEV, EIS plus NSBBs was 
the first-line treatment for the prevention of rebleeding.107,182 How￾ever, with the superior efficacy and safety to EIS, EBL is consid￾ered as a endoscopic treatment of choice for secondary prophy￾laxis. In a meta-analysis, EBL reduced the rebleeding rate (40.4% 
vs. 57.4% within 2 years, P=0.09; RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.74), 
mortality rate (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.98), and the incidence of 
esophageal strictures (RR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.03-0.29) compared to 
EIS.153 Adding EIS to EBL has no additional benefitial effects as 
compared with EBL alone.183,184
Currently, the first-line therapy for secondary prophylaxis is the 
combination of NSBBs plus EBL. Addition of NSBBs to EBL may act 
synergistically, because it could prevent rebleeding before variceal 
eradication by EBL and also could prevent variceal recurrence af￾ter eradication. Several RCTs showed that significantly lower re￾bleeding rate in the combination treatment group compared to 
the EBL alone.185,186 Consistently, rebleeding rate was significantly 
lower with a combination treatment than single treatment with 
EBL (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.89) or NSBBs (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.59-0.86) in a meta-analysis.187 However, in another meta-analy￾sis, although combination treatment significantly reduced rebleed￾ing compared to the EBL alone (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.69), the 
benefit of this treatment was only marginal compared to the 
pharmacological therapy (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00).188 This re￾sults suggest that NSBBs are the cornerstone of secondary pro￾phylaxis and other treatment, such as TIPS, should be considered 
in NSBBs-intolerant patients, rather than single treatment with 
EBL. In patients in whom EBL is not available, addition of ISMN to 
NSBBs to maximize portal pressure lowering effect could be con￾sidered.5
Recent several RCTs evaluated the efficacy of carvedilol for sec￾ondary prophylaxis.189,190 The incidences of rebleeding (29.3% vs. 
42.2% within 2 years, P=0.857) and mortality (23.0% vs. 38.3%, 
P=0.110) did not differ between the carvedilol and EBL alone 
groups.189 Another study compared the efficacy of carvedilol to 
ISMN+NSBB and showed no difference in the incidence of re￾bleeding (61% vs. 62%, P=0.90) and rebleeding from EVs (51% 
vs. 43%, P=0.43).190 However, in both studies, carvedilol was not 
compared to the current standard of care, combination of EBL and 
NSBBs, and more data are needed to recommend carvedilol for 
secondary prophylaxis. In addition, carvedilol may decrease arte￾rial pressure22 and its use should be avoided in patients with re￾fractory ascites.191
In a recent multicenter RCT, addition of simvastatin to the stan￾dard treatment for prevention of variceal rebleeding, EBL plus NS￾BBs, did not reduce the rebleeding rate (25% in the simvastatin 
group vs. 28% in the placebo group, P=0.699), while it signifi￾cantly reduced the mortality rate (9% vs. 22%, P=0.030).192 The 
improvement in mortality in the simvastatin group was mainly re￾lated to a decrease in liver-related deaths (absolute risk reduction, 
10.4%; 95% CI, 0.26%-20.5%).192 While, two episodes of symp￾tomatic rhabdomyolysis were reported in the simvastatin group. 
Both patients had poor liver function at baseline with a bilirubin 
level >5 mg/dL and it suggested that patients with severely dete￾riorated liver function might develop rhabdomyolysis at lower 
doses than the general population. This calls for a close monitor￾ing of muscle enzymes in this particular group of patients, and for 
testing either atorvastatin or lower doses of simvastatin in future 
studies including patients with advanced cirrhosis.192
TIPS is considered as a treatment of choice in patients who have 
rebleeding despite first-line secondary prevention with EBL plus 
NSBBs. In a recent RCT, rebleeding rate was lower the TIPS group 
(7% vs. 26%) with a higher incidence of encephalopathy com￾pared to the ISMN+NSBBs group.193
MANAGEMENT OF GASTRIC VARICES
In a previous study, prevalence of GVs in patients with portal 
hypertension regardless of the etiology was 25.9% and it was 
21.6% in 301 of 568 patients (53%) who had cirrhosis-induced 
portal hypertension.194 In another study, 25.1% of patients with 
cirrhosis had GVs, which was lower than the prevalence of EVs of 
57%.195 Bleeding occurs less frequently in GVs compared to EVs: 
GV bleeding accounts for 14-36% of acute variceal bleed￾ing.166,196,197 However, once bleeding occurs, patients with GV

bleeding have a poorer prognosis and are associated with a re￾quirement of more transfusions and higher rebleeding and mortal￾ity rates than those with EV bleeding.194,198,199 In a previous pro￾spective study, the incidence of GV bleeding was 16%, 36%, and 
44% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis 
and fundal varices (GOV2, 29.5%; isolated gastric varices 1 
[IGV1], 70.5%).195 The size of varices, presence of red color sign, 
and the degree of liver function were independent predictive fac￾tors for GV bleeding.195
Classification of GVs
Sarin’s classification is the most commonly used, because it is 
useful for risk stratification and management of GVs.194 Firstly, 
GVs are divided into GOV and IGV according to the association of 
GVs with EVs. And then, GOV and IGV are divided into GOV1/
GOV2 and IGV1/IGV2, respectively, according to their location 
within the stomach. GOV1 appears as continuations of EVs and 
extend for 2-5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, along 
the lesser curvature of the stomach, while GOV2 extend below 
gastroesophageal junction into the fundus of the stomach. IGV1 
is located in the fundus of the stomach and IGV2 is located any￾where in the stomach or intestine as isolated ectopic varices. 
GOV2 and IGV1 are also called as fundal varices. Hemodynami￾cally, GOV1 and EVs are supplied mainly from the left and right 
gastric veins, while GOV2 and IGV1 are frequently supplied from 
the short and posterior gastric veins.73 IGV2 is caused by dilation 
of branches of the gastroepiploic veins.200
In a previous study, GOV1 was the most common subtype of 
GVs (14.9% of patients with portal hypertension) followed by 
GOV2 (5.5%) in patients with portal hypertension. The prevalence 
of IGV1 and IGV2 were 1.6% and 3.9%, respectively.194 While the 
bleeding incidence is higher in the fundal varices (78% for IGV1 
and 55.1% for GOV2) than GOV1 (11.8%) and IGV2 (9.1%).194
However, although the bleeding risk is not high in GOV1, because 
of the highest prevalence, GOV1 is the most common site of GV 
bleeding (55-67% in GOV1, 24-29% in GOV2, 9-20% in IGV1, 
and 0-2.3% in IGV2).44,201,202
GVs vs. EVs
There are several differences in the characteristics between EVs 
and GVs, which could affect the treatment efficacy by some mo￾dalities. Firstly, GVs usually lie much deeper within the submucosa 
than EVs.203 Therefore, thicker underlying submucosal layer of GVs 
could lead partial ligation of varices by EBL, which could lead fatal 
bleeding after the detachment of the band.204-206 Secondly, varice￾al size is usually larger in GVs compared to EVs, which also could 
be a cause of partial ligation by EBL. EBL is usually not recom￾mended for large varices (diameter >2 cm) because of the limited 
diameter of the ligator.207 Thirdly, GVs are continuously exposed 
to gastric acid and pepsin.208 Therefore, the incidence of bleeding 
from EBL-induced ulcers may be more frequent in the stomach 
than in the esophagus.209 Fourthly, peristalsis of the stomach may 
lead sloughing of ligated tissue by EBL.44 Fifthly, large spontane￾ous gastrorenal shunts are more frequent in GVs (60-85% of cas￾es)73,210 than EVs (17-21% of cases)73 and the blood of these 
shunts is fast and abundant.211 Because screlosing agent of EIS 
escape into the systemic circulation rapidly through these shunt, 
EIS is not effective for the management of GVs. In addition, this 
large shunts could compete with the TIPS as a porto-systemic 
blood outflow pathway. Therefore, most of the blood flow might 
remain in GVs even after creation of TIPS with unchanged high 
risk of bleeding. Lastly, probably because of the presence of large 
spontaneous gastrorenal shunts in GVs, the mean portal pressure 
in patients with GVs is usually lower than in those with EVs.73
Therefore, NSBBs or TIPS may be less effective for GVs than EVs.
Primary prophylaxis
There is only one RCT on the primary prophylaxis against fundal 
variceal bleeding which compared the efficacy of NSBBs, EVO, 
and no treatment.212 In this study, 89 patients with cirrhosis and 
large (≥10 mm in size) fundal varices (GOV2, 85.4%; IGV1, 
14.6%) were randomized to EVO, NSBBs, or no treatment and the 
cumulative GV bleeding rate over a median follow-up of 26 
months was significantly lower in the EVO group (13%) than in 
the NSBBs group (28%, P=0.039) and no-treatment group (45%, 
P=0.003) without significant difference between the NSBBs and 
no-treatment groups (P=0.374).212 Although this study suggested 
the superior efficacy of EVO, further studies are needed to evalu￾ate the risk and benefit ratio to recommend EVO for the primary 
prophylaxis. In addition, the role of NSBBs for primary prophylaxis 
against GV bleeding is questionable. Although several previous 
studies suggested that BRTO is very effective in the primary pro￾phylaxis in patients with fundal varices,82,213 prospectively de￾signed, larger-scale, randomized trials are needed for the recom￾mendation. Because there are no studies evaluated the efficacy of 
TIPS in this setting and considering the adverse events by TIPS 
such as increased incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, TIPS is not

recommended.115
Most guidelines recommend that primary prophylaxis for GOV1 
follow the recommendations for EVs.115 because GOV1 could dis￾appear after the treatment of EVs. This recommendation is based 
on the previous studies which showed disappearance of GOV1 in 
59% of patients within 6 months after EIS for EVs.194 However, 
currently recommended treatment for EVs is EBL, rather than EIS 
and action mechanisms of two procedures are quite different. Be￾cause mechanical strangulation is the main mechanism for the 
eradication of EVs in EBL, treatment effect is usually limited to the 
mucosa and submucosa, while, because the main mechanism for 
EIS is the chemical reaction which leads to fibrosis, the effects of 
EIS could extend into the differ layers and perforating veins. In 
addition, sclerosant flows in a caudal direction towards the 
GOV1.214-216 Therefore, EIS could obliterate GOV1 also, which is 
associated with EVs, while the effect of EBL for EVs on the GOV1 
is not clear. In a recent retrospective study that evaluated the 
changes of GOV1 after eradication of EVs by EBL, GOV1 disap￾peared in 64.7% of patients,217 which was comparable to the dis￾appearance of GOV1 after EIS for EVs in the previous study.194
In summary, until now, there is no recommendation for patients 
with fundal varices that have not bleed.115 In patients with GOV1 
without previous history of bleeding, GOV1 could disappear after 
the eradication of EVs by EBL.
Bleeding control 
The endoscopic treatment of choice for bleeding from GVs is 
EVO. Various studies showed more than 90% of success rate in 
the initial hemostasis201,218-221 and 22-37% of rebleeding 
rate.201,218,219 In a previous retrospective study to evaluate long￾term outcome of patients treated with EVO for GV bleeding, initial 
hemostasis rate was 96.2% and rebleeding rates at 1, 5, and 10 
years were 35.3%, 47.3%, and 51.8%, respectively.222
Several RCTs compared the efficacy of EVO and EBL for bleed￾ing from GVs. In the first study which was performed with 60 pa￾tients with GV bleeding (GOV1, 68.3%; GOV2, 23.3%, and IGV1, 
8.3%), EVO showed significantly higher hemostasis rate (87% vs. 
45%, P=0.03) and significantly lower rebleeding rate (31% vs. 
54%, P<0.001).44 In the second study which was performed with 
97 patients with GV bleeding (GOV1, 54.6%; GOV2, 25.8%; and 
IGV1, 19.6%), although hemostasis rate was comparable between 
two groups (93.3% in both group, P=1.000), rebleeding rate was 
significantly lower in the EVO group (22.4% vs. 43.8%, 
P=0.044).201 Third study was performed with 37 patients with 
bleeding from GVs (GOV1, 59.5%; GOV2, 40.5%, and IGV1, 0%) 
and although success rate in initial hemostasis did not differ be￾tween EBL and EVO groups (88.9% vs. 100%; P=0.43), rebleed￾ing rate was significantly higher in the EBL group (72.2% vs. 
31.6%, P=0.03).223 A recent meta-analysis suggested the signifi￾cantly higher hemostasis rate (RR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.14-17.30; 
P=0.032) and significantly lower GV recurrence (RR, 0.26; 95% 
CI, 0.11-0.61; P=0.002) and rebleeding (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18-
0.60; P=0.0004) rates in the EVO group compared to the EBL 
group.224
Before the introduction of EBL and EVO, EIS was used to control 
acute bleeding from GVs.199 Some authors suggested high success 
rates for immediate hemostasis, but they also showed high re￾bleeding rates.199,225 Currently, EIS is not recommended for bleed￾ing from GVs. In a retrospective study which compared EVO and 
EIS for bleeding from GVs, EVO showed significantly higher hemo￾stasis rate (100% vs. 52.4%, P<0.01) and significantly lower re￾bleeding rate (1-year rebleeding rate, 7.6% vs. 76.6%, P<0.01).226
Although there was only a trend toward higher hemostasis rate in 
the EVO group compared to EIS group in a previous RCT (89% vs. 
62%, P=NS), this analysis was performed with only 17 patients (8 
in EIS group and 9 in EVO group) who had acute bleeding.218
Although several retrospective studies suggested high efficacy 
of TIPS in patients with acute bleeding from GVs,227,228 there is no 
RCT evaluating the efficacy of TIPS for initial hemostasis in pa￾tients with GV bleeding. Considering the side effects, costs, and 
the requirement of equipment and experienced radiologists, TIPS 
is not recommended as first-line treatment for GV bleeding. Rath￾er, TIPS could be a good option in patients with GV bleeding re￾fractory to pharmacological and endoscopic treatments. In several 
studies evaluating the efficacy of “salvage” TIPS for refractory GV 
bleeding, hemostasis rate was 90-96%.227,228 BRTO also could be 
a good option in this condition with high treatment success rate 
of 95-100%.229,230
GOV1 shows both characteristics of EVs and fundal varices. 
Characteristics of GOV1 similar with EVs are the size and the 
route of portal blood flow to the varices, while characteristics of 
GOV1 similar with fundal varices is the location. GOV1, similar 
with EVs, is supplied from the left and right gastric veins, while 
fundal varices (GOV2 and IGV1) are frequently supplied from the 
short and posterior gastric veins.73 The size of GOV1 is usually 
smaller than that of fundal varices, much more similar with EVs. 
Therefore, current guidelines recommend both EBL and EVO for 
GOV1 bleeding. However, GOV1 is located in the stomach, the 
same location as with fundal varices, where the underlying sub-

mucosal layer is thicker than that in the esophagus. Thicker un￾derlying submucosal layer of GVs could lead partial ligation of 
varices by EBL, which could lead fatal bleeding after the detach￾ment of the band.204-206 In addition, stomach is continuously ex￾posed to gastric acid and pepsin.208 Therefore, the incidence of 
bleeding from EBL-induced ulcers may be more frequent in the 
stomach than in the esophagus.209 These characteristics could in￾crease the risk of treatment failure by EBL. Two RCTs showed simi￾lar efficacy between EBL and EVO for treating GOV1 bleed￾ing,201,231 another RCT showed a trend toward higher hemostasis 
rate in the EVO group compared to the EBL group (85% vs. 43%, 
P=0.08).44 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis suggested the su￾perior efficacy of EVO compared to EBL for the prevention of re￾bleeding from GOV1 (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.94; P=0.035).224
A retrospective study showed a higher incidence of post-treat￾ment ulcer bleeding and higher mortality rates in the EBL group 
as compared to those in the EVO group.209 In addition, a recent 
retrospective study showed significantly lower rebleeding rate (2-
year rebleeding rate, 3.6% vs. 41.4%, P=0.004) and a trend to￾ward lower mortality rate in the EVO group compared to the EBL 
group (2-year mortality rate, 6.9% vs. 25.8%, P=0.050).232
In summary, EVO is recommended for bleeding from fundal vari￾ces (GOV2 and IGV1). In patients with bleeding from GOV1, EVO 
is preferred than EBL. TIPS or BRTO could be considered in pa￾tients with refractory fundal varices.
Secondary prophylaxis
EVO is one of options for secondary prophylaxis. For this pur￾pose, EVO should be repeated until complete obturation of GVs is 
achieved. In various studies which evaluated the long-term effect 
of EVO for GV bleeding, rebleeding rate was 8.0-29.2%.233-239 In a 
recent retrospective study with 91 patients who were treated with 
EVO for GV bleeding (GOV1, 22.0%; GOV2, 38.5%; and IGV1, 
28.6%), the 1- and 2-year GV rebleeding rates were 11.0% and 
21.3%, respectively. GV rebleeding rates were significantly higher 
in GOV2 (22.7% and 43.8%, respectively) compared to GOV1 
(3.7% and 12.5%, respectively) and IGV1 (5.0% and 5.0%, re￾spectively).240
A previous RCT compared the efficacy of EVO and NSBBs for 
secondary prophylaxis after achievement of hemostasis by EVO.241
The 6-week rebleeding rate (23.8% vs. 15.0%, P=NS) and mor￾tality rate (14.3% vs. 30.0%, P=NS) did not differ between the 
EVO and NSBBs groups. However, the sample size of this study 
was relatively small (n=41). In addition, only 25% of patients had 
bleeding from GVs and 75% of patients with bleeding from EVs 
were treated with EVO.241 In a more recent RCT, rebleeding rate 
(15% vs. 55%, P=0.004) and mortality rate (3% vs. 25%, 
P=0.026) were significantly lower in the EVO group than in the 
NSBBs group in patients with successful hemostasis with EVO for 
fundal variceal bleeding.242 In another RCT, 95 patients with fun￾dal variceal bleeding, which was successfully controlled with EVO, 
were randomized to EVO alone group or EVO plus NSBBs 
group.243 Rebleeding rate (22.9% vs. 23.4% at 1 year, P=0.336) 
and mortality rate (16.7% vs. 21.3%, P=0.936) did not differ be￾tween the EVO alone and EVO plus NSBBs groups.243 These stud￾ies suggest that NSBBs have no role in the secondary prophylaxis 
in patients with fundal varices.
A previous RCT compared EVO and TIPS for secondary prophy￾laxis. In this trial, 72 patients with GV bleeding (GOV1, 50.0%; 
GOV2, 45.8%; and IGV1, 4.2%) were randomized to repeated 
EVO or TIPS placement after hemostasis with EVO.244 Significant 
GV rebleeding rate was significantly lower in the TIPS group than 
in the EVO group (11% vs. 38%, P=0.014) with significantly high￾er incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the TIPS group (25.7% 
vs. 2.7%, P<0.01).244 Survival rate did not differ between two 
groups (2-year survival rate, 70% in the TIPS group vs. 83% in 
the EVO group, P=0.17).244 Although this study suggested the su￾perior efficacy of TIPS to EVO for prevention of rebleeding from 
GVs, considering the high incidence of encephalopathy and no 
difference in mortality rate, further studies are needed to recom￾mend TIPS for secondary prophylaxis. In addition, rebleeding rate 
in the EVO group in this study was slightly higher compared to 
other studies. Especially, rebleeding occurred in 11 of 17 patients 
(65%) with bleeding from GOV1,244 which is usually smaller and 
shows better treatment response compared to bleeding from 
GOV2 or IGV1.
Various studies suggested that BRTO is very safe and effective 
in the management of GVs with high technical success (77-100%) 
and complete GV obliteration (82-100%) rates.245 A previous 
study showed very low 5-year GV recurrence (2.7%) and bleeding 
(1.5%) rates after BRTO in patients with fundal varices.246 In this 
study, EV worsening rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 27%, 58%, 
and 66%, respectively.246 In another retrospective study, 5-year 
GV rebleeding rate after BRTO was 2.4% and the occurrence rates 
of high-risk EVs at 1 and 5 years were 8.6% and 17.6%, respec￾tively.221 In a recent meta-analysis, technical success rate, clinical 
success (defined as no recurrence of GV bleeding or complete 
obliteration of GV) rate, and EV recurrence rate was 96.4%, 
97.3%, and 33.3%, respectively.78 In a recent prospective non-

randomized trial compared the efficacy of EVO and BRTO for the 
prevention of GV bleeding in patients with GV bleeding or high￾risk GVs, GV bleeding rate was significantly lower in patients 
treated with BRTO (15.4%) compared to those treated with EVO 
(71.4%, P<0.01).247 However, GV bleeding rate was too high in 
the EVO group in this study (more than 50% of patients within 1 
year).247
In summary, in patients who have recovered from GV bleeding, 
secondary prophylaxis with repeated EVO or BRTO could be rec￾ommended. TIPS could be considered as an option in patients 
with good liver function and are not feasible for EVO or BRTO.
SUMMARY
Variceal bleeding is still a serious complication in patients with 
liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Even with appropriate 
pharmacological and endoscopic treatment, mortality rate still re￾mains high as 15-20%. Although several studies evaluated the ef￾ficacy of NSBBs for the prevention of development or aggravation 
of varices, results are controversial. Therefore, there is no recom￾mendation in patients with cirrhosis without varices or with low￾risk small varices. In patients with large EVs, although EV eradica￾tion by EBL is recommended, while EBL plus NSBBs is more 
effective in the primary prophylaxis against EV bleeding in a very 
recent RCT. In patients who have survived from EV bleeding, EBL 
plus NSBBs is recommended. Although there have been several 
data regarding the role of carvedilol in the prevention of develop￾ment or aggravation of varices and primary and secondary pro￾phylaxis, further studies are needed to confirm the effect of 
carvedilol. Until now, there is no recommendation for patients 
with fundal varices that have not bleed. In patients with GOV1 
without previous history of bleeding, GOV1 could disappear after 
the eradication of EVs by EBL. EVO is recommended for bleeding 
from fundal varices. In patients with bleeding from GOV1, EVO is 
preferred than EBL. TIPS or BRTO could be considered in patients 
with refractory fundal varices. In patients who have recovered 
from GV bleeding, secondary prophylaxis with repeated EVO or 
BRTO could be recommended. TIPS could be considered as an op￾tion in patients with good liver function and are not feasible for 
EVO or BRTO.
