Abstract
Background: Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by recurrent episodes of
fever and polyserositis and by the onset of reactive amyloid-associated amyloidosis. Amyloidosis due to familial
Mediterranean fever can lead to end-stage renal disease, culminating in kidney transplantation for some patients. In
this study, we report the clinical outcome of two brothers with familial Mediterranean fever who were the inadvertent
donor and recipient, respectively, of a kidney. Subsequently, they were diagnosed with renal amyloidosis secondary to
familial Mediterranean fever and were successfully treated with anakinra and colchicine.
Case presentation: Two brothers with familial Mediterranean fever and renal amyloidosis were the inadvertent
donor and recipient, respectively, of a kidney. The recipient had presented recurrent acute febrile episodes of
familial Mediterranean fever, developed nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis and needed bilateral
nephrectomy and chronic dialysis. His elder brother, in apparent good health, donated his left kidney to his
brother. Immediately after the kidney transplantation, both the donor and recipient presented massive
proteinuria, impaired renal function and elevated serum amyloid A levels. Biopsies of the brothers’ kidneys
showed amyloidosis. Genetic studies thereafter revealed a homozygous variant for the MEFV gene (NM_000243.2.c.
2082G > A; p.M694I) in both brothers. At this point, both the donor and recipient were treated with colchicine and
anakinra, resulting in improved renal function, decreased proteinuria, undetectable serum amyloid A levels and stable
renal function at 62 months of follow-up and no major adverse effects.
Conclusions: In familial Mediterranean fever, analyses of the MEFV gene should be performed in potential live kidney
donors from a direct family member (either between siblings or between parents and children). In addition, genetic
studies are required when consanguinity is suspected between members involved in the living transplant. Finally,
anakinra could be a safe adjuvant therapy combined with colchicine for patients with familial Mediterranean fever and
amyloidosis, including those with successful kidney transplantation.

Background
There has been a progressive increase worldwide in the
number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
who require kidney transplantation. As a result, many
transplantation programs have been forced to recruit
more cadaveric and living donors [1, 2]. In many coun￾tries, living related donors are still the main source of
kidneys for transplantation due to the poor legal defin￾ition and deficient organization required for a cadaver
donor work-up [1, 2] and by the fact that recipient and
graft survival rates with living donors have consistently
been higher than the rates achieved with cadaver donors
[3]. Once a suitable living donor has been found, it is ne￾cessary to ensure that the donor has two properly func￾tioning kidneys and that renal function is evenly divided
between them. The battery of tests for the preoperative
evaluation of potential live-kidney donors is currently
considered adequate for detecting or suspecting any
functional or anatomical renal abnormality but does not
include prior genetic tests. Performing a uninephrect￾omy in living related donors without first conducting
genetic studies could, however, accelerate the progres￾sion of pre-existing occult primary renal disease [4, 5] in
both the recipient and donor.
Amyloidosis due to familial Mediterranean fever
(FMF) can lead to ESRD, culminating in kidney trans￾plantation for some patients [6]. Amyloidosis can de￾velop in patients who have never experienced clinical
symptoms of FMF (known as phenotype 2) [6, 7]. Sur￾prisingly, there are currently no available data regarding
the clinical outcomes of living relative donors who carry
amyloidosis due to FMF. This report is, to our know￾ledge, the first case of FMF and unrecognized renal
amyloidosis in both donor and recipient after living
related kidney transplantation involving a pair of broth￾ers with the same homozygous MEFV gene mutation
(p.M694I/p.M694I). We discuss the current evidence on
this topic and summarize the exceptional experience of
two FMF patients with severe FMF mutations and di￾vided renal mass, who had renal amyloidosis and were
successfully treated with colchicine and anakinra.
Case presentation
Patient population
Recipient
A 31-year-old man, originally from Morocco, was admit￾ted to Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC, The
Netherlands) complaining of leg edema in February 2000.
The patient had a history of recurrent episodes of inflam￾mation, fever and serositis. The patient was diagnosed
with nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis secondary to
FMF. His family had 7 siblings with consanguineous par￾ents. At that time, no genetic mutations were found. After
another episode of FMF in 2009, the patient presented
with renal failure and nephrotic syndrome that did not re￾spond to conservative therapy (angiotensin-converting-en￾zyme inhibitors, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, cyclosporine and colchicine). He was suspected not
to be compliant with treatment. A bilateral nephrectomy
was performed to halt the progressive catabolism due to
unrestrained renal protein loss. The patient, a Dutch resi￾dent, required chronic dialysis. At this time, there was no
evidence of clinical cardiac involvement by amyloidosis. In
2011, he received a left kidney transplant from his elder
brother, a resident of Spain, who had no medical history
of note (the preoperative evaluation of his clinical status
and renal function were unremarkable). The kidney
donation and transplantation were performed in the
Netherlands. The recipient received a standard im￾munosuppression protocol (cyclosporine, mycopheno￾lic acid and prednisolone). After transplantation, the
recipient’s postoperative course was unsatisfactory,
with a 10% decrease in serum creatinine levels on 3
consecutive days during the first postoperative week.
His renal function subsequently improved, although
slowly, and he developed massive proteinuria (18 g/
day) and elevated serum amyloid A levels and was di￾agnosed with nephrotic syndrome. A graft transplant
biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition. The pa￾tient underwent treatment with colchicine (0.5 mg/
12 h, adjusted for renal function), anakinra (100 mg/
day), prednisolone (10 mg/day), mycophenolic acid
(540 mg/12 h) and cyclosporine (150 mg/12 h). After
6 months, the patient presented a serum creatinine
level of 2.10 mg/dL (185.6 μmol/L) and proteinuria of
0.25 g/day. After 20 months, the graft was function￾ing well, with a serum creatinine level of 2.40 mg/dL
(212.1 μmol/L), undetectable serum amyloid A levels
and proteinuria of 0.20 g/day. After 62 months and at
the time of this report, his serum creatinine was
2.05 mg/dL (182 μmol/L), Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) value of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2
and proteinuria of 0.44 g/day.
Donor
An apparently healthy 45-year-old man, originally from
Morocco and a resident of Spain for 12 years, was con￾sidered a living kidney donor for his younger brother.
His medical history and examination was compatible for
a living related kidney donation procedure. A thorough
physical examination showed no abnormalities, and the
laboratory work-up included urine analysis, urine cul￾ture, blood test and liver function, the results of which
were all within normal ranges. Other studies revealed a
serum creatinine level of 1 mg/dL (88.4 μmol/L), cre￾atinine clearance of 113 mL/min/1.73 m2
, a 24-h urine
protein level of 100 mg and a C-reactive protein (CRP)
level of 6 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). A computed
Peces et al. BMC Medical Genetics (2017) 18:97 Page 2 of 6

tomography (CT) angiography of his abdomen showed
both kidneys had a perfect configuration with a single renal
artery and vein, a normal excretory system and normal ap￾pearance of the bladder. After the kidney donation in 2011,
the patient presented nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and
developed an erysipelas-like erythema of the lower legs. On
the fifth postoperative day, he presented a serum creatinine
level of 2.08 mg/dL (184 μmol/L). With the diagnosis of
prerenal renal failure, the patient was started on IV fluids,
which resulted in partially improved renal function. He was
released from hospital on the seventh day after the kidney
transplantation and was readmitted 3 days later for dyspnea
and chest pain. At that time, his serum creatinine level had
increased to 2.20 mg/dL (197 μmol/L). Nineteen days after
the transplantation, the patient presented a serum creatinine
level of 4.80 mg/dL (424.3 μmol/L), proteinuria of 25 g/day
and a serum amyloid A level of 85 mg/L. A renal biopsy
showed 8 glomeruli, one of which was globally sclerosed
and all were pathological. There was extensive expansion of
the mesangium, with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive eo￾sinophilic material, which also caused occlusion of the glom￾erular capillaries. The eosinophilic material also invaded the
blood vessels and was stained with Congo Red. The intersti￾tium presented fibrosis and a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate.
There was also a component of acute tubular necrosis with
regeneration. The patient underwent treatment with colchi￾cine (0.5-1 mg/12 h, adjusted for renal function) and ana￾kinra (100 mg/day). After 4 weeks, the patient presented a
serum creatinine level of 3.80 mg/dL (339 μmol/L), protein￾uria of 16 g/day and an undetectable serum amyloid A level.
Treatment with candesartan (2 mg/day) was then started.
Fourteen weeks after the kidney donation, the patient had a
serum creatinine level of 1.93 mg/dL (171 μmol/L) and pro￾teinuria of 7.5 g/day. He remained on regular colchicine
(0.5 mg/12 h), anakinra (100 mg/48 h), candesartan (4 mg/
day) and enalapril (5 mg/day) for 4 months. After 20 months,
the patient was in good clinical condition. The serum cre￾atinine level had stabilized at 1.50 mg/dL (132.6 μmol/L),
creatinine clearance was 61 mL/min/1.73 m2 (MDRD of
53.3 mL/min/1.73 m2
), and proteinuria was 2.6 g/day. An
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. Al￾though the possibility of anakinra withdrawal was consid￾ered, we decided on indefinite therapy with anakinra and
colchicine due to the satisfactory response. After 62 months
and at the time of this report, the patient was taking colchi￾cine (0.5 mg/12 h), anakinra (100 mg/48 h) and atorvastatin
(40 mg/day). His serum creatinine level was 1.40 mg/dL
(123.7 μmol/L), his creatinine clearance was 67.4 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (MDRD of 55.7 mL/min/1.73 m2
) and his protein￾uria was 1.1 g/day.
Molecular analysis
An initial genetic study on the recipient was conducted
in 2000 with negative results. A second genetic analysis
was performed in 2011 after the living transplantation
on both brothers. Briefly, genomic DNA was prepared
from 200 μL of whole blood, using a commercial kit.
Hot spot testing for exons 2 (c.278 to c.910) and exon
10 (c.1900 to c.2346) of the FMF gene (MEFV), as well
as exons 3, 4-5, 6-7 including introns 2,4 and exons 6 9,
11, by direct PCR and automated sequencing revealed
homozygosity in the MEFV gene (c.2082G > A; p.M694I;
National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London
Medical School, London, UK). The reason p.M694I was
not found in 2000 is not known, given that this founder
mutation had been already described in 1998 [8, 9]. This
missense mutation has a founder effect in the African
Mediterranean population (Lebanon 12.6%; Tunisia;
13%, Syria 4.8%; Egypt 20.6%), and dates back more than
8500 years (Lebanon) (Mediterranean Founder Mutation
Database). This change has been established as a patho￾genic variant (Clin Var: RCV000220431.2) in a recessive
condition.
Discussion and Conclusions
FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene located
on chromosome 16p13.3, which is composed of 10
exons and encodes the 781-amino-acid protein known
as pyrin/marenostrin, which regulates inflammation by
modulating the IL-1 pathway [7, 10]. To date, more than
150 gene alterations (mutations/polymorphisms) located
in the MEFV gene have been identified [7, 11]. The hot￾spot changes p.M694 V, p.V726A, p.M694I and p.M680I
in exon 10 and p.E148Q in exon 2 are the most frequent
among all populations and are associated with the most
severe clinical outcomes, with amyloidosis occurring in
50-60% of untreated patients [11]. Serum amyloid A, the
amyloidogenic precursor protein, is synthesized by the
liver in response to proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL￾6 and tumor necrosis factor) and is then transported in
plasma as a component of high-density lipoprotein [10].
Colchicine has reduced the incidence of this complica￾tion, which now only appears in untreated, undertreated
and resistant patients, but colchicine is usually ineffect￾ive in patients with advanced amyloidosis. Clinically,
FMF presents as 1 of 3 phenotypes: phenotype 1, which
is commonly associated with recurrent short episodes of
inflammation; phenotype 2, characterized by the pres￾ence of reactive amyloid-associated amyloidosis, the
most severe complication of FMF, as the first clinical
manifestation of the disease in an otherwise asymptom￾atic individual; phenotype 3, referred to as the silent
homozygous or compound heterozygote state, in which
2 MEFV mutations are detected without signs or symp￾toms of FMF or of amyloidosis [7, 12, 13]. In this report,
the recipient had phenotype 1 while the donor had
phenotype 2 (pre-existing occult primary renal disease).
After the living donation procedure, the donor developed
Peces et al. BMC Medical Genetics (2017) 18:97 Page 3 of 6

a typical episode of FMF, which was likely induced by sur￾gical stress. It is also plausible that nephronic reduction
and concomitant hyperfiltration related to kidney dona￾tion constituted the trigger in our cases. Thus, the donor’s
uninephrectomy caused a release of amyloid with an in￾crease in the serum amyloid A level. A renal biopsy re￾vealed extensive amyloidosis in both kidneys. Moreover,
the reduction (at least) to half in terms of renal mass in￾duced an increase in the glomerular filtration rate of the
remaining nephrons, leading to glomerular hypertension
and proteinuria in the one kidney with pre-existing amyl￾oidosis. In this way, glomerular hypertension could
exacerbate the sclerosing glomerulopathy of amyloidosis
and lead to proteinuria and renal failure in both the donor
and recipient. This form of presentation as a rapidly pro￾gressive amyloidosis was compatible with the termed
“amyloid kidney storm”, a phenomenon seen rarely in
FMF patients [14]. On the other hand, since the donor
with phenotype 2 had the same mutation as the recipient,
the chances were high that the donor would have devel￾oped renal failure in the foreseeable future, even if he had
not donated a kidney.
Unfortunately, the genotype-phenotype correlation in
FMF is not well established, and there are unexplained
ethnic differences in amyloidosis rates [7, 12, 15]. These
brothers who shared a common genotype (p.M694I/
p.M694I) presented different phenotypic characteristics:
one complained of intermittent abdominal pain, arthritis
and fever and developed ESRD secondary to renal amyl￾oidosis, while the other was asymptomatic prior to
donation. The observation of different phenotypic pre￾sentations with a common genotype in two family mem￾bers shows that each phenotype cannot be explained by
particular mutations. This intrafamilial variability in the
clinical expression could be explained by the action of
modifying genes concomitant to the MEFV gene muta￾tions. Another possible explanation for intrafamilial vari￾ability could be the characteristics of phenotype 2 FMF
in the donor, as occurred in this case. A recent series
established a frequency of 22/420 phenotype 2 FMF pa￾tients [13]. Therefore, phenotype 2 FMF is not as rare as
was once thought, which should be kept in mind for all
patients with unexplained proteinuria and/or acute phase
response in high-risk ethnic groups for FMF. To under￾stand the correlation between genotypic and phenotypic
FMF variants, the presence of complex alleles, modifier
loci, genetic heterogeneity and possible epigenetic factors
should be studied extensively.
Regular prophylactic treatment with colchicine pre￾vents or substantially reduces the clinical manifestations
of FMF in at least 90% of cases. Patients with M694I
therefore showed a favorable response to colchicine
therapy, while those with P369S and R408Q did not
[15]. Colchicine reduces the inflammatory response by
preventing activation, degranulation and migration of neu￾trophils, binding to β-tubulin and leading to β-tubulin￾colchicine complexes [16, 17]. Anakinra (an IL-1 receptor
antagonist) is a novel therapeutic alternative that has been
used as an adjunct therapy [16–22]. There has been no
previous reports of living kidney transplantation from a
donor with FMF to a recipient who also has FMF, with
colchicine and anakinra treatment then initiated for both
the recipient and the donor.
Both brothers were started on colchicine and ana￾kinra to minimize further amyloid production, resulting
in improved renal function and decreased proteinuria.
They appeared to respond to colchicine and anakinra
with complete remission of their FMF episodes and an
improvement in renal function and the nephrotic
syndrome. Due to the extensive amount of amyloid ob￾served in the kidney biopsies, we decided to continue
with indefinite treatment with anakinra and colchicine.
Thus, for both brothers, colchicine and anakinra re￾sulted in not only an amelioration of the acute febrile
episodes of FMF inflammation but also an improve￾ment in the kidney dysfunction that result from several
years of amyloidosis. To our knowledge, this is the first
instance of FMF and renal amyloidosis occurring in the
transplant after a living related kidney transplantation,
as well as an outcome with satisfactory renal function
in both donor and recipient, for a pair of brothers shar￾ing the same homozygous MEFV gene mutation. It is
possible that renal transplantation prevents FMF epi￾sodes in the recipient. In this case, the protective role
of immunosuppressive therapy cannot be ruled out
[11]. However, a recent report showed the progression
of systemic amyloidosis associated with FMF in a pa￾tient who underwent a living donor renal transplant￾ation not having received colchicine or anakinra [23].
On the other hand, there was no evidence of a drug
interaction between colchicine/anakinra and the im￾munosuppression administered to the kidney recipient
[18, 24–27]. Moreover, when we analysed the impact of
renal transplantation on the status and progression of
FMF and amyloidosis, there was evidence that the long￾term outcomes of transplantation was similar to that in
the general transplant population and maintenance col￾chicine, even after decreasing its dose, effectively pre￾vents recurrence of amyloidosis in the allograft [27].
These cases reveal that the presence of phenotype 2
FMF should be considered in cases of living kidney
transplantation from direct family members such as a
brother or sister. In-depth analyses of the MEFV gene
are needed to obtain an adequate diagnosis of patients
with clinical suspicion of FMF and are obligatory when
consanguinity is suspected. In-depth FMF analyses of
the entire MEFV gene should be conducted in potential
live kidney donors. Finally, anakinra can be a safe

adjuvant therapy when combined with colchicine for pa￾tients with FMF and amyloidosis, including those with
successful kidney transplantation. However, further con￾trolled studies to better evaluate the safety and efficacy
of colchicine/anakinra in the long-term treatment of pa￾tients with FMF and amyloidosis are necessary.
