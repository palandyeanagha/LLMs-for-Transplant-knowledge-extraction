It is widely believed that the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is completely cleared by antiviral 
antibodies and specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) during acute viral hepatitis. We now 
demonstrate that traces of HBV are often detectable In the blood for many years after 
clinical recovery from acute hepatitis, despite the presence of serum antibodies and HBV￾specific CTLs, which can be present at acute-stage levels. The strength of the CTL response 
to HBV following clinical recovery correlates with persistence of HBV DNA. It is of particular 
interest that HBV-specific CTLs from patients studied up to 23 years after clinical and 
serological recovery expressed activation markers (HLA-DR, CD69) indicating recent 
contact with antigen. These results suggest that sterilizing immunity to HBV frequently fails 
to occur after recovery from acute hepatitis and that traces of virus can maintain the CTL 
response for decades following clinical recovery, apparently creating a negative feedback 
loop that keeps the virus under control, perhaps for life. 
A vigorous, polyclonal and specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte re￾sponse against multiple hepatitis B virus epitopes is readily 
detectable in the peripheral blood during acute self-limited HBV 
infection' ..... In contrast, the CTL response is weak or unde￾tectable in the face of the high viral load characteristic of chronic 
HBV infection. 
Recently, we reported that traces of virus can be detected in 
the peripheral blood of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-
negative patients long after they have recovered from HBV in￾fection, cleared all viral antigens and developed antiviral 
antibodies'·'. Although the basis for trace viral persistence is not 
understood, it is likely that immunological mechanisms control 
the viral burden and prevent reactivation of disease in these 
otherwise healthy individuals. While the antibody response to 
HBV probably prevents viral spread in this setting, the possibil￾ity that the CTL response to HBV might participate in this 
process is unexplored. 
In the current study, we demonstrate that HBV-specific CTLs 
persist in the blood for several decades after clinical and serologi￾cal recovery from acute viral hepatitis. Furthermore, we show that 
the CTLs can be present at acute-stage precursor frequencies long 
after recovery, can display an activated phenotype and can coexist 
with trace amounts of HBV DNA. These results indicate that con￾tinuous priming of the CTL response by persistent virus or viral 
antigens occurs long after clinical recovery, and they suggest that 
the CTLs control HBV replication in these subjects since a weak 
CTL response corresponds with high viral load in patients with 
chronic hepatitis.

The HBV-specific CTL response persists for decades 
In this study, we monitored the CTL responses to five previously 
defined HLA-A2-restricted HBV CTL epitopes'·'·"·' in 17 individuals 
who serologically and clinically recovered from acute viral hepati￾tis up to 30 years earlier (Table 1) and in 12 uninfected normal 
controls. Because detection of these responses required prior in 
vitro stimulation, the data reflect the presence of CTL precursors 
in the peripheral blood of these patients, not CTL effectors. 
The sum of the percent cytotoxicity of eight replicate micro￾well cultures stimulated with the same peptide was designated 
the CTL response index for the peptide (CRI-P) and is shown in 
bold in Table 1 if it was more than 3 standard deviations (s.d.) 
above the mean CRI-P values in the 12 normal controls. The 
mean control CRI-P values for each peptide plus or minus the 
standard deviation, and the CRI-P cutoffs above which CTL re￾sponses in the patients were considered positive were for peptide 
1: 16.2 ± 17.1, cutoff 68; peptide 2: 13.2 ± 14.8, cutoff 58; peptide 
3: 32.5 ± 21.9, cutoff 98; peptide 4: 19.8 ± 16.5, cutoff 69; and 
peptide 5: 8.7 ± 7.7, cutoff 32. The sum of all the positive CRI-P 
values was designated the total CRI, as previously reported•. 
Using these stringent criteria, 11 of the 17 subjects responded 
to multiple HBV epitopes, whereas S of the remaining 6 subjects 
responded to a single epitope (Table 1). It is noteworthy that 
many of these CTL responses were very strong, frequently ex￾ceeding the control CRI-P values for the corresponding epitope 
by >5 s.d., and occasionally >20 s.d. The level and variability of 
CTL responsiveness in these subjects is similar to what we have 
previously reported during the hyperacute phase of viral hepati￾NATURE MEDICINE, VOLUME 2, 1'<lJMBER 10, OCTOBER 1996

Table 1 CTL responsiveness and HBV DNA following acute viral hepatitis fore in vitro stimulation in subjects 15 and 
16. Depletion of DR-positive T cells before 
in vitro stimulation abolished the peptide￾specific CTL responses to peptides 1 and 3 in 
subject 15 (Fig. 1, a and b) and decreased the 
CTL response to peptide 5 in subject 16 (Fig. 
le). In a separate experiment, using T cells iso￾lated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS) from a later bleed date in subject 16, we 
found that all of the CTL activity segregated in 
the DR-positive T-cell population and was de￾pleted from the DR-negative T cells (Fig. Id). 
These results suggest that, consistent with the 
HBV DNA-positive status of these subjects, 
their CTLs were recently activated by exposure 
to virus despite the fact that they had recovered 
completely from acute viral hepatitis 18 (sub￾ject 15) or 2.4 (subject 16) years earlier.

The CTL response to HBV can 
wane after clearance of HBV DNA 
Two subjects were studied sequentially for 
approximately 2 years (Fig. 2). Both had nor￾malized serum alanine aminotransferase and 
cleared all viral antigens within 3 months 
after acute hepatitis B, and they are both 
currently entirely healthy. Subject 1 was re￾peatedly negative for HBV DNA by nested 
PCR and Southern blot analysis, as early as 
17 pos pos 1392 558 264 528 59 42 
All subjects were HBsAg and HBeAg negative and, except for no. 7, anti-HBc positive. All 
subjects were anti-HBs positive, except nos. 6, 7, 12, 13, 15. Serum ALT activity was normal at 
the times indicated. CRI-P values >3 s.d. above the normal control are shown in boldface type. 
tis•·• and is not related to HLA-A2. l subtype differences (F.V.C. et 
al., manuscript in preparation). 
CTL response strength correlates with persistence of HBV DNA 
In keeping with previous reports from this laboratory'·', 11 of 
these subjects displayed HBV DNA in their serum and/or periph￾eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), on the basis of the nested 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction (Table 1). These results 
were compared with the total CRI values for each patient to deter￾mine whether there was a direct correlation between the strength 
of the CTL response and the presence of HBV DNA. As shown in 
Table 1, the highest total CRI values were observed in the six sub￾jects who were positive for HBV DNA in their serum, including 
subjects who had resolved their hepatitis 15-23 years earlier. It is 
noteworthy that all of these subjects responded to four of the five 
HBV epitopes except subject 12 who responded to three epitopes. 
These observations are consistent with the notion that the CTL 
response in these subjects may have been maintained by contin￾ued exposure to HBV (see below). The reason for selective HBV 
DNA positivity of PBMCs in some subjects (Table 1) is not clear at 
this time, but it would appear that the presence of HBV DNA in 
the serum represents a stronger immunogenic stimulus for induc￾tion of HBV-specific CTLs than its presence in PBMCs. In fact, the 
CTL responses of the five subjects whose PBMCs alone were HBV 
DNA positive were indistinguishable from the HBV DNA-negative 
group, displaying much lower total CRI values than the subjects 
whose serum was positive for HBV DNA, and responding to fewer 
HBV peptides (Table 1). 
The CTL response can reflect recent activation 
To determine whether the CTL responses·detected long after clini￾cal and serological recovery reflect recent or remote activation, 
PBMCs were depleted of DR-positive (recently activated) T cells be￾NATURE MEDICINE, VOLUME 2, NUMBER 10, OCTOBER 1996 
1 month after clinical onset, and remained negative for the dura￾tion of follow-up. In contrast, subject 16 remained HBV DNA 
positive at all time points monitored. The CTL response to HBV 
was readily detectable in the HBV DNA-negative subject for 
22 months after recovery, but it waned thereafter and was unde￾tectable at the 26-month time point (Fig. 2). In the HBV DNA￾positive patient, on the other hand, the specific CTL response 
remained strong during the entire follow-up period. The forego￾ing observations were confirmed by quantification of the CTL 
precursor frequency for HBV Pol 455-463 (peptide 4) in both sub￾jects. CTL precursors specific for this epitope were present at 
acute-stage levels for at least 22 months in the HBV DNA-positive 
subject 16, whereas they decreased to nearly one-tenth over the 
same period in subject 1 who became HBV DNA negative very 
early during his episode of acute hepatitis B (see legend to Fig. 2). 
Persistent CTLs recognize endogenously synthesized antigen 
We previously demonstrated that the CTL response in patients 
with acute HBV infection is HLA class I restricted and mediated 
by CDS-positive T cells that recognize endogenously synthesized 
antigen'-4. The same is true in four subjects studied up to 22 years 
after recovery (Fig. 3). Peptide-specific lines from those individu￾als were shown to recognize target cells that were either stably 
transfected with an HBV-EBO construct• or transiently infected 
with a vaccinia virus inducing endogenous synthesis of HBV pro￾teins (Fig. 3, a and b), even at effector-target (E:T) ratios as low as 
3:1 (Fig. 3a). As expected, the specific cytotoxicity could be 
blocked by antibodies against HLA class I, specifically HLA-A2.1, 
and by antibodies against CDS but not CD4 (Fig. 3c). 
Discussion 
On the basis of clearance of HBV-encoded antigens from the 
blood and the appearance of antiviral antibodies, it is generally

assumed that HBV is completely eradicated during clinical recov￾ery from acute hepatitis. This notion is strengthened by the dis￾appearance of HBV DNA from the blood following recovery, 
using conventional solid-phase or fluid-phase hybridization as￾says•·•. Recently, however, we demonstrated that small amounts 
of viral DNA can be detected by nested PCR in the serum and/or 
PBMCs of persons convalescent from acute hepatitis for as long 
as 7 years after seroconversion and clinical recovery' . Long-term 
viral persistence in these individuals is not entirely unexpected, 
as antibodies to HBV antigens remain detectable for decades 
after recovery from acute viral hepatitis, often for life. Because 
residual viral antigens can persist in dendritic cells for very long 
periods'°·"; however, persistent antibody titers need not reflect 
the continued presence of active virus. The induction of virus￾specific CTLs, on the contrary, characteristically requires the 
synthesis of viral antigens by infected cells. Therefore, in the cur￾rent study we asked whether the CTL response to HBV, a hall￾mark of acute HBV infection, persists or wanes after recovery 
from viral hepatitis. We also sought to determine whether there 
was a relationship between the strength of the CTL response and 
the frequency of HBV-specific CTL precursors in persons who re￾main HBV DNA positive by nested PCR and those who do not. 
Finally, we examined the CTLs for activation markers to deter￾mine whether they had recently seen antigen or reflected long￾term memory of a remote infection in the distant past. 
The results of this study are quite clear. CTL responses to multi￾ple epitopes in the HBV nucleocapsid, envelope and polymerase 
antigens remain detectable in the peripheral blood of some indi￾viduals for two or more decades after clinical, biochemical and 
serological recovery from acute viral hepatitis (Table 1). It is note￾worthy that in the patients whose CTLs were analyzed with 
activation markers, the CTL response was shown to be mediated 
by DR-positive T cells (Fig. 1), indicating that they had recently

been activated in vivo, presumably by exposure to viral antigens 
expressed by infected cells. Finally, there is a good correlation be￾tween the persistence of viral DNA in the serum of these subjects 
and the overall strength and precursor frequency of the CTL re￾sponse to the HBV epitopes studied (Table 1, Fig. 2), which is 
mediated by CDS-positive, HLA class I-restricted T cells that rec￾ognize endogenously synthesized antigen (Fig. 3). 
These observations extend our earlier report' that HBV persists 
following recovery from acute viral hepatitis, and they suggest 
that the virus is probably transcriptionally active in these individ￾uals because it coexists with, and actively maintains, a CTL 
response against its structural and nonstructural antigens. It is of 
interest that, in one subject who became HBV DNA negative as 
shown by nested PCR, the CTL response was detectable for nearly 
two years but waned thereafter (Fig. 2). Although these results 
suggest that the life span of CTLs with HBV-specific memory in 
this patient is on the order of 2 years and that the persistence of

Alternatively, anti-CD4 or anti-CDS monoclonal antibodies were added 
to peptide 4-specific CTL lines before addition of the target cells as de￾scribed in the text. Cytotoxicity was measured at an E:T ratio of 60:1 in 
a 4-h " Cr release assay. 
--------· ·----
CTLs for much longer periods of time may reflect continuous ac￾tivation of the CTL response by trace amounts of virus, several 
other HBV DNA-negative subjects mounted CTL responses (albeit 
weakly) for 3.2, 4.0 and 23 years after recovery. This suggests that 
memory CTL responses may survive for much longer periods in 
the absence of antigenic stimulation in some individuals. This 
could not be tested directly, however, as the CTL responses in 
these individuals and in the subjects who displayed HBV DNA in 
their PBMCs but not serum were not strong enough for activation 
marker depletion experiments. It is relevant that the duration of a 
CTL response in the absence of continuous antigenic stimulation 
is an area of controversy at the moment12 1'. 
The results of this study reinforce the concept that HBV can per￾sist for many years after recovery from acute hepatitis. Because we 
only sampled the blood of these patients and because the nested 
PCR and CTL assays have a finite detectability threshold, it is con￾ceivable that HBV may persist in everyone who recovers from initial 
infection. Our current study suggests that this infection is held in 
check by the CTLs, because five subjects (nos. 6, 7, 12, 13 and 15) 
lacked antibodies to HBsAg (fable l). If this interpretation is correct, 
the results of this study raise several important issues including the 
possibility of viral rea<.tivation during immunosuppression1
" · " , the 
site (or sites) of persistent infection, the basis for incomplete clear￾ance, the possibility of viral escape, and the likelihood that these 
individuals (or their organs) may be infectious for others. Indeed, 
several reports have confirmed that organ donors who are negative 
for HBsAg, positive for antibodies to h epatitis B core antigen (anti￾HBc), and negative for immunoglobulin M antibodies to HBV core 
(HBclgM) can transmit HBV infectionzo-2'. 
Perhaps most important, this study illustrates that acute and 
chronic hepatitis during HBV infection probably represent th e ex￾tremes of a biological continuum rather than the discrete en tities 
they have previously been thought to be, and that gradations in the 
strength of the CTL response might influence where each patient 
falls in the spectrum of outcomes characteristic of HBV infection . 
Finally, the data suggest that active maintenance of the CrL response 
following acute hepatitis probably controls HBV replication in these 
otherwise healthy individuals, because the absence of this response 
correlates with high viral load in patients with chronic hepatitis.

Patient population. Seventeen HLA-A2-positive subjects with typi￾cal clinical histories and serological evidence of acute icteric viral 
hepatitis 0.6-30 years earlier were enrolled in this study (Table 1 ). 
HBV serology consistent with acute HBV infection was documented 
for all individuals except subject 7 whose laboratory results were not 
available for review (not shown). The serology at the time of the cur￾rent analysis is described in Table 1. Results were compared with 12 
HLA-A2-positive, HBV DNA-negative healthy, uninfected controls 
with no clinical history of HBV infection. All individuals enrolled in 
this study were repeatedly negative for antibodies to HCV and HIV. 
Synthetic peptides, HBV antigens and expression vectors. Five pep￾tides representing previously identified HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes 
[HBV core 18-27, FLPSDFFPSV; HBV Env 183-191, FLLTRIL Tl; HBV Env 
335-343, WLSLLVPFV; HBV Pol 455-463 GLSRYVARL; HBV Pol 575-583 
FLLSLGIHL (ref. 6)] were used in this study. Recombinant (r)HBcAg was 
obtained from bacterial extracts of Escherichia co/f4. Recombinant vac￾cinia virus constructs encoding the large envelope protein (vHBS4, adw 
subtype)•, the HBV polymerase protein (vpol, ayw subtype)4'25 or the 
HBV core protein (C-vac, ayw subtype)26 were used for transient expres￾sion of HBV proteins in human EBV-B cell lines (B-LCL) as previously 
described•, and wild-type vaccinia virus26 was used as a control. 
Stimulation of PBMCs with synthetic peptides. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells were separated on Ficoll-Histopaque gradients, 
stimulated with synthetic peptides plus rHBcAg and recombinant 
human IL-2 (rlL-2) (Hoffmann- La Roche, Nutley, New Jersey) and 
tested for cytolytic activity on day 14 as described' . The remaining 
cells in each set of eight replicate wells were combined, restimulated 
and tested on days 21-24 to further characterize the CTL response.

CTL response. Target cells consisted of the following: jY-EBV B cells in￾1107

described•. Spontaneous release was less than 20% of maximum 
release. In selected experiments 100 µI hybridoma supernatant con￾taining anti-HLA-A2 (MA 2.1, lgGl) monoclonal antibody or 10 µg/ml 
anti-class I (W6/32, lgG2a) monoclonal antibody [American Type 
Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, Maryland] were added to the tar￾get cells; alternatively, anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies 
(10 µg/ml) were added to the effector cells for 30 min before starting 
the assay.

U-bottom plate containing 10 µg/ml peptide and 1 µg/ml rHBcAg, 
fed with 10 U/I rlL-2 on days 4, 7 and 11 and restimulated with au￾tologous, irradiated PBMCs and peptide on day 7. A split-well CTL 
assay was performed on day 14. Cultures were considered positive 
if the specific cytotoxicity was more than 2 s.d. above the mean of 
the nonspecific cytotoxicity. CTL precursor frequency was calcu￾lated using the maximum likelihood method as described'". 
T-cell subset fractionation. Several experiments were performed to 
assess the HBV-specific CTL activity in PBMCs subsets displaying differ￾ent activation phenotypes. In one experiment, T cells obtained by 
rosetting with AET-treated sheep red blood cells (Sigma) as previously 
described29 and positively selected for COB-positivity with magnetic 
beads (Dynal, Lake Success, New York) were incubated with 2.5 µg 
anti-DR-specific monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, 
California) for 60 min on ice. After washing, cells were incubated with 
washed GAM-Dynabeads (Dynal) at a bead-cell ratio of 50:1. DR-neg￾ative, CDS-positive T cells were recovered using a magnet and 
stimulated with peptide as described above. In a second experiment, 
purified T cells were depleted of CD4-positive and CD45RA-positive 
cells using magnetic beads (Becton Dickinson) according to the man￾ufacturer's instruction. The negatively selected cells were stained with 
anti-DR antibody (Becton Dickinson) and sorted into DR-positive and 
DR-negative subpopulations on a Becton Dickinson Consort 30 
flow cytometer. Efficiency of depletion was checked by FACS analysis 
using unlabeled anti-DR antibodies and FITC-conjugated goat anti￾mouse lgG Oackson lmmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, 
Pennsylvania). DR-depleted and DR-enriched T cells were stimulated 
as described above. On day 21, all replicate cultures were pooled and 
tested for cytolytic activity over a broad E:T range. Results were com￾pared with unfractionated T cells. 
HBV DNA determination by PCR. HBV DNA was extracted from 
100 µI serum and 1 x 1 O' PBMCs and analyzed by nested PCR using 
highly conserved diagnostic primer pairs exactly as described•. The 
sensitivity level was 10 HBV genome equivalents per reaction using 
plasmid pFC80 (ref. 30), which contains four copies of HBV DNA as 
a standard. Positive results were confirmed by Southern hybridiza￾tion analysis using a full-length HBV DNA probe'.
