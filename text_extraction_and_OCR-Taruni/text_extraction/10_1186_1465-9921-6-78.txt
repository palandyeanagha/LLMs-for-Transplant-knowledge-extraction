Abstract
The use of biomarkers in medicine lies in their ability to detect disease and support diagnostic and
therapeutic decisions. New research and novel understanding of the molecular basis of the disease
reveals an abundance of exciting new biomarkers who present a promise for use in the everyday
clinical practice. The past fifteen years have seen the emergence of numerous clinical applications
of several new molecules as biologic markers in the research field relevant to interstitial lung
diseases (translational research). The scope of this review is to summarize the current state of
knowledge about serum biomarkers in interstitial lung diseases and their potential value as
prognostic and diagnostic tools and present some of the future perspectives and challenges.
Introduction
The use of biomarkers in medicine lies in their ability to
detect disease and support diagnostic and therapeutic
decisions. New research and novel understanding of the
molecular basis of the disease reveals an abundance of
exciting new biomarkers who present a promise for use in
the everyday clinical practice. The initial evaluation of a
serum biomarker concerns its expression in patients with
the disease and in normal individuals in order to define
sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of a test is
defined as the proportion of patients with disease having
a positive test whereas the specificity is the proportion of
patients without the disease who have a negative or nor￾mal test (Table 1). Consequently the serum level of an
ideal marker should: 1) increase pathologically in the
presence of the disease (high sensitivity), 2) not increase
in the absence of the disease (high specificity), 3) add
information about the risk or prognosis 4) change in
accordance with the clinical evolution, reflecting the cur￾rent status of disease, or better 5) anticipate clinical
changes, i.e. indicating the presence of relapse before it
becomes obvious at a clinical level and finally 6) relate to
disease burden and extent 7) be reproducible (as deter￾mined by the low coefficient of variation), 8) be of easy
and cheap determination [1,2].
Very few markers present a threshold at which the risk
suddenly rises. The interplay between sensitivity and spe￾cificity and the nature of the disease under prediction
assigns suitable cut-off points. Sensitivity and specificity
calculated at various cut-off points give rise to a receiver￾operating-characteristic (ROC) curve [2]. A clinically

useful biomarker will be one with the largest area under
the ROC curve. A number of novel blood biomarkers of
lung disease including cytokines, enzymes, adhesion mol￾ecules, collagen relevant products and products of type II
epithelial cells, have been studied for their clinical
applicability.
The need for a biomarker in Interstitial Lung Diseases
In diffuse lung disease, there has been confusion for dec￾ades because of the term "disease activity" that variably
means a) inflammation and responsiveness to therapy;
and b) progressiveness. In diffuse lung disease, there are
two separate therapeutic goals: a) a short term response as
judged by improvements in pulmonary function test
(PFT) and regression of imaging abnormalities as judged
mainly by high resolution computed tomography
(HRCT); and b) slowing or prevention of decline. It fol￾lows logically that a useful biomarker might conceivably
predict either responsiveness (i.e. the inflammatory com￾ponent) or the risk of progression of fibrotic disease.
Therefore, the clinical utility of a biomarker is critically
dependant upon whether clinicians have tools in diffuse
lung disease that accurately predict: a) responsiveness and
b) progression of disease. There is much less need to pre￾dict responsiveness than progressiveness. HRCT is reason￾ably accurate in the separation between a group of
patients in which disease is clearly irreversible and a group
of patients in whom responsiveness is reasonably likely
[3]. Hunninghake et al. [4,5] reported that a confident
HRCT pattern diagnostic of UIP can predict outcome as
well as a histologic diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumo￾nia (UIP). They also concluded that, when a HRCT pattern
diagnostic of UIP is present, the extent of disease is the
best predictor of mortality. However, the change in extent
of disease is not yet confirmed to be predictive of survival.
Moreover, even in cases in which HRCT is indeterminate
in this regard the clinician has an answer very quickly with
a trial of corticosteroids. By contrast, there is no reliable
routine tool with which to predict the likelihood of pro￾gression of fibrotic disease with or without therapy. Even
in the usually progressive disorder, (UIP), there is signifi￾cant heterogeneity in the risk of progression and in other
disorders. HRCT may be quite good at distinguishing
between individual disorders but it does not have any
track-record at all in predicting the rapidity of decline,
within individual diseases. Moreover, the value of bron￾choalveolar lavage (BAL) in assessment of prognosis and
treatment in the strictly defined UIP subset is still an open
question [6]. Thereby, clinicians need a biomarker with
which to predict decline; a fibrogenetic biomarker.
Another key benefit a biomarker might provide is more
accurate prognostic information from change in that
biomarker, especially if the information can be obtained
rapidly (i.e. short term change with treatment). The cur￾rent serial tests including serial HRCT and PFT provide
scattered statements regarding the prediction of long-term
outcome. Flaherty et al. [7] stated that short term changes
in baseline PFT are strongly predictive of long term sur￾vival in patients with well defined UIP and non-specific
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), whereas serial changes in
HRCT were of limited value. In addition, Latsi et al. [8]
have recently demonstrated that serial PFT is probably the
best so far for this role in UIP/ NSIP patients (predicts
survival and longitudinal behaviour of the disease more
accurately than baseline variables) but represents only an

approximate guide and you have to wait for months for
the information.
Requirements for a biomarker in Interstitial Lung Diseases
On the contrary to the listed theoretical requirements
reflecting the profile of an ideal marker, a useful biomar￾ker in the real world of clinical practice, simply needs to
fulfil an unmet need. If current non-invasive and semi￾invasive tools predict outcome very accurately, a biomar￾ker will add little extra information of value. Therefore, it
simply needs to provide more accurate information about
progressiveness than current modalities, not independent
information. Is it mandatory for a biological predictor to
add independent information about prognosis? Is it nec￾essary for a clinician to score the scan or the factor in the
lung function severity mathematically, every time a
biomarker is to be measured? Additionally, this informa￾tion should be transferable, since the definition of inter￾stitial lung diseases (ILDs) is not yet constant and
therefore test accuracy may vary considerably from one
setting to another [9].
Regarding serial monitoring, whether or not a biomarker
is highly reproducible is less crucial than clear quantifica￾tion of the reproducibility, in order to distinguish
between true change and measurement "noise". A marker
might be poorly reproducible and yet highly accurate
when it does clearly change. Furthermore, a poorly repro￾ducible biomarker may be highly accurate when the range
is categorized into for example a five – point semi quanti￾tative scale, in order to address reproducibility issues.
Moreover, there is confusion between diagnostic and
prognostic requirements. A diagnostic marker needs to be
sensitive and specific [10]. However, a prognostic biomar￾ker could, in principle, be normal when disease is present
but stable. Alternatively, based on the conception that the
best diagnosis is prognosis, the most useful diagnostic
marker will be the one that separates patients against the
disease-specific outcomes [11]. Additionally, relation to
disease burden and extent should not represent prerequi￾sites for a valuable biomarker. Clinicians have PFT and
HRCT for this task. Many abnormalities are simply by￾products of extensive fibrotic disease and are not inform￾ative about pathogenesis/progressiveness, per se. Failure
to distinguish between severity and progressiveness has
severely hindered clinical research in this field. Adding
knowledge about progressiveness is one of the most fruit￾ful applications. In addition, the ideal biomarker should
not be confounded by severity ("current status"). The
ideal marker should normalize in value when an effective
treatment is found to prevent decline of extensive fibrotic
disease, even though the "current status" of disease sever￾ity is unchanged.
In conclusion, the clinical need for a biomarker in diffuse
lung disease regarding the presence or absence of the dis￾ease, the histospecific diagnosis and the prediction of
responsiveness has probably little value. On the other
hand, clinical necessity becomes invaluable regarding the
baseline prediction of rate of progression and the early
prediction of progression based on serial change with
treatment. This will allow anti-inflammatory or other
treatments to be evaluated or eventually modified before
they have failed.
The scope of this review is based on the fact that although
there are numerous published papers investigating the
utility of biomarkers in the clinical research field, the
number of review articles summarizing the current state of
knowledge about the clinical applications of these mole￾cules as diagnostic and prognostic tools in the research
field relevant to common ILDs such as idiopathic pulmo￾nary fibrosis (IPF), scleroderma, sarcoidosis, as well as
other ILDs including radiation and drug- induced pneu￾monitis, pediatric ILDs and occupational and environ￾mental diseases, still remains inadequately small.
Serum biomarkers in Interstitial Lung Diseases
Beyond other important functions, the lung epithelium
produces complex secretions, including mucus blanket,
surfactant proteins, as well as several proteins important
for host defense [12].
Sampling the epithelial lining fluid by bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) represents the common means of studying
the proteins secreted by the lung epithelium and investi￾gating their alterations in lung disorders [13]. However,
the past fifteen years, scientists led by pioneering studies
[14] that showed the presence of these proteins in the
bloodstream as well, even though in small amounts, dem￾onstrated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) significant variations of these proteins' levels in
the serum of patients with different ILDs. The latter sug￾gests that their assay might represent a novel approach in
the assessment of lung diseases with still elusive patho￾genesis, prognosis, diagnosis and therapeutic interven￾tions. Because these proteins are mainly, if not exclusively
secreted within the respiratory tract, their occurrence in
the vascular compartment can be explained by several
hypothetical mechanisms including [12]:
• Leakage from the lung into the bloodstream resulting
from the increased permeability of lung vessels and the
destruction of the barrier between alveolar epithelium
and endothelium caused by injury to the basement
membrane

• Increased production by the alveolar type II cells cou￾pled with an increase in total type II cells per lung due to
diffuse hyperplasia and
• Diminished clearance rates from the circulation.
In the present review article we have focused on recent
publications concerning the most studied and interesting
lung peripheral biologic markers in ILDs, namely: lung
epithelium specific proteins (markers of epithelial dam￾age), circulating cytokines estimating various types of
inflammatory activity and finally enzymes and metabo￾lites, products of epithelioid cells and derivatives of acti￾vated macrophages. (Table 2)
Lung epithelium-specific proteins
Surfactant-associated Proteins
Pulmonary surfactant is a complex and highly surface
active material covering the alveolar space of the lung.
Biochemically, surfactant is a molecular mixture com￾posed mainly of structurally heterogeneous phospholip￾ids. A major function of pulmonary surfactant is to reduce
the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveo￾lus, thereby preventing alveolar collapse on expiration. It
has also been demonstrated that the surfactant contains
specific proteins [15]. Four surfactant-specific proteins
with different structural and functional properties have so
far been identified. They were named surfactant protein-
(SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D according to the chronologic
order of their discovery [16] and have been divided in two
distinctive groups, the low-molecular-weight hydropho￾bic SP-B and SP-C and the high-molecular-weight￾hydrophilic SP-A and SP-D. The latter belong to the collec￾tin subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily and are pro￾duced by two types of non-ciliated epithelial cells in the
peripheral airway, Clara cells and alveolar type II cells.
Studies have demonstrated that these proteins play
important roles in the innate immune system of the lung
[17] and have been used as useful markers for confirming
the diagnosis and evaluation of disease activity of various
ILDs since they reflect the epithelial damage and turnover.
SP-A has also been used as a marker for lung adenocarci￾nomas to differentiate lung adenocarcinomas from other
types and metastatic cancers from other origins, and to
detect metastasis of lung adenocarcinomas [18]. Even if
the lung appears as the major site of their synthesis, their
expression is not restricted to the respiratory tract but has
been detected in several extrapulmonary tissues [19,20].

Mucin-associated Antigens
Mucins are major components of the mucus layer cover￾ing the airway epithelium. They consist of high-molecu￾lar-weight glycoproteins belonging to a broad family of
mucin peptides [12]. Mucins are either associated with
membranes or secreted at the surface of the respiratory
tract [12]. Krebs von den Lungen-(KL)-6 is mainly associ￾ated with cellular membranes. It was initially described by
Kohno et al. [14] as a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein
and was classified as human MUC1 mucin. Immunohis￾tochemistry has mainly detected KL-6 in alveolar type II
and epithelial cells of the respiratory bronchioles.
Although KL-6 is predominantly expressed by airway cells,
however is not entirely lung specific, since it is also
present on other somatic cells, such as pancreatic cells,
eosophageal cells and fundic cells of the stomach [21].
Functionally KL-6 has been demonstrated to be inducible
for the migration of human lung and skin fibroblasts, sug￾gesting a potential role in the lung fibrogenic process [22].
Additionally KL-6 is a sensitive indicator of damage to
alveolar type II cells, which strongly express this mucin at
their surface. Type II pneumonocytes are regenerated over
the alveolar basement membrane after the death of type I
pneumonocytes over the first stage of lung injury. There￾fore, its raise would theoretically represent the destruction
of the normal lung parenchyma and architecture, the
increased permeability of the air-blood barrier as long as
the regenerating process as expressed by type II pneu￾monocytes' activity. Towards this direction KL-6 has been
reported by several studies some of them cited in this
review article as a sensitive marker for ILDs such as IPF,
collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial pneumo￾nia (CVD-IP), radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity
pneumonitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Clara Cell Protein (CC16)
The Clara Cell secretory protein-(CC)-16 is a low-molecu￾lar-weight protein of 16 kDa is secreted in large amounts
into the lumen of the respiratory tract by nonciliated
bronchiolar Clara cells in humans and rodents [23].
Immunohistochemical studies have shown that CC16 is
not an entirely specific and exclusive product of Clara cells
or even the lung [24,25]. The exact functions of CC16 are
still elusive but there is increased knowledge that CC16
serves as an important immunosuppressive and anti￾inflammatory mediator in the lung [12]. Additionally
CC16 can inhibit production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells [12]. Serum CC16
has been demonstrated to elevate in several conditions
known to be related with an impairment of the air-blood
barrier, including pulmonary fibrosis [26] or lung injury
caused by firesmoke [27]. Thus, several group of scientists
estimated CC16 blood levels to determine whether these
are associated with the degree of lung involvement in ILDs
and thereby can serve as a useful biomarker of the disease
activity and severity.
Other lung-epithelial markers
Cytokeratin is a specific cytoskeletal structure expressed in
epithelial cells, including bronchial epithelia [28,29]. Of
the 27 known subunits of cytokeratin, cytokeratin frag￾ment 19 (CK19) has been found soluble in serum and its
levels have already been evaluated as a useful tumour
marker for lung cancer [30]. Since it has been suggested
that CK19 is released from injured bronchial epithelium
[31], the past ten years it has been hypothesized and even￾tually indicated by several reports in the literature that
CK19 serum levels are elevated in IPF and other ILDs and
can be well correlated with the disease prognosis and
diagnosis. Thus, in nowadays, there is an ongoing attempt
to scrutinize the value of CK19 in evaluating the severity
of lung injury as reflected by the increasing number of
published papers investigating the role of this biologic
marker in ILDs.
The cancer-associated antigens sialyl Lewis (a) (Ca 19-9)
and sialyl Lewis (x) (SLX) are carbohydrate structures used
as markers of cell differentiation and embryonic develop￾ment [32]. It has been reported that a variety of these anti￾gens is expressed on the cell surface during tumor
progression [33]. Elevated circulating levels of these anti￾gens have been associated with neoplastic transformation
and metastases and therefore been used as tumor markers
in the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma [34,35]. Serum
levels of carbohydrate antigens have been found, how￾ever, also raised in some patients with non-malignant
lung diseases such as IPF [36], tuberculosis [37] and dif￾fuse parabronchiolitis [38] and moreover immunohisto￾chemical analysis demonstrated their presence in the
hyperplastic bronchiolar epithelium, on the surface epi￾thelium cells and on exudates in air space. Repeated dam￾age to the lungs may force these antigens into the blood
circulation resulting to the elevated serum levels of these
markers detected in these patients. Hence, it has been
speculated that their elevation could mirror the extent of
lung injury and serve as a valuable prognosticator of dis￾ease progression.
Cytokines and other serological parameters
A number of cytokines probing different aspects of the
immunopathogenesis of ILDs have been tested for their
clinical usefulness as serum biomarkers for monitoring
disease severity and predicting response to treatment and
therefore leading to early diagnosis of progressive disease
and determination of therapeutic interventions.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-(MCP)-1 and mono￾cyte inflammatory protein- (MIP)-1a belong to the C-C
subfamily of the chemokine family and appear to be

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:78 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/78

(page number not for citation purposes)
important factors in the monocyte/macrophage-mediated
inflammatory process in the ILDs [39,40]. It has been
reported that epithelial cells, macrophages and vascular
endothelial cells are the major-MCP-1-producing cells in
IPF lung tissue [41]. Moreover, an elevation of MCP-1 and
MIP-1a concentrations in BAL from patients with IPF and
sarcoidosis has recently been demonstrated [40,42].
Tempted by the latter observation several group of scien￾tists aimed to measure the levels of MCP-1 and MIP-1a in
the serum and determine their clinical significance as a
reliable and easily repeatable serological parameters for
the differential diagnosis of ILDs and the monitoring of
their clinical course.
IFN-inducible T cell-a chemoattractant-ITAC/CXCL-11 is
a chemoattractant CXC chemokine with versatile proper￾ties including immunomodulatory, definsin-like antimi￾crobial, antiangiogenic and potentially antifibrotic
activities. It has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis and
thereby to reduce aberrant vascular remodeling resulting
in diminished fibrosis [43,44]. Studies have demon￾strated a direct association of this molecule with the plei￾otropic cytokine IFN-γ1b [43,44] evidence that captured
the interest of both clinicians and researchers to investi￾gate the effects of this newly applied treatment on biologic
markers such as ITAC/CXCL-11 associated with fibrosis,
angiogenesis and immunomodulation in the plasma of
patients with ILDs and ultimately reveal novel molecular
pathways which support IFN-γ1b therapeutic utilities.
In addition, the activity and release of a large body of
inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), antioxidant enzymes (glutathione), procollagen
peptides (type III) and markers of cell damage such as lac￾tate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been evaluated as prog￾nostic and monitoring tools of the disease development,
activity and progression in a variety of occupational and
environmental studies.
Other delineated serological parameters that have been
scrutinized for their clinical efficacy as serum biologic
markers of the disease severity and the activation of sev￾eral inflammatory cells contributing to the immun￾opathogenesis of the disease include markers of T-cell
activation and markers for the evaluation of macrophage/
monocyte activity.
Soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) represents a biomarker of
the T-cell activation and can be found in BAL fluid and
serum of sarcoidosis patients and it is released by acti￾vated alveolar immune cells. In addition to lymphocytes,
activated sarcoid alveolar macrophages are capable of
expressing increased numbers of sIL-2R upon activation
[45]. There are several reports in the literature, some of
them are reviewed here, that reveal an intimate relation￾ship between this parameter and the clinical activity of the
disease, providing further evidence for the close linkage
between the course of sarcoidosis and the activated state
of T-cells [45].
Parameters suitable for gauging the activity of the macro￾phage lineage in ILDs and specifically sarcoidosis and
occupational diseases have been delineated and comprise
the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) a product of
epithelioid cells that reflect the granuloma burden of the
entire body, neopterin a metabolite of the guanosinetri￾phosphate pathway that is released by activated macro￾phages and monocytes under the control of IFN-γ
produced by T-cells [45] and b-glucuronidase a lysosomal
enzyme, associated with increased phagocytic activity
[46]. Serum and BALF levels of these molecules have been
found elevated in patients with sarcoidosis and environ￾mental lung disorders and have been used in the everyday
clinical practice as markers for the clinical assessment and
follow-up of granulomatous inflammation and dust￾induced inflammatory response.
1. Serum biomarkers in Idiopathic Pulmonary 
Fibrosis and Collagen Vascular Disease – 
associated Interstitial Pneumonia (Tables 3 and 
4)
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a refractory and
lethal ILD characterized by fibroblast proliferation, extra￾cellular matrix (ECM) deposition and progressive lung
scarring. The incidence of IPF is estimated at 15–40 cases
per 100.000 per year, and the mean survival from the time
of diagnosis is 3–5 yr regardless of treatment [47]. On the
other hand, scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis￾SSc), is a systemic disease characterized by a progressive
dermatologic abnormality. Systemic involvement may
include among others, restrictive lung disease which
develops in 30–60% of patients with scleroderma and
progresses to severe restrictive lung disease and pulmo￾nary fibrosis (a major cause of death in scleroderma) in
15% of these patients [48]. However, predicting the pro￾gression of IPF and SSc as well as their prognosis still
remains elusive. To evaluate the activity and monitor the
course of the disease HRCT, PFT, BAL and histologic fea￾tures are clinically used [48]. Nonetheless, there are prob￾lems with the sensitivity, effort-dependability and mainly
the ease of repetition of these examinations.
One of the pioneering studies that set the foundations for
the development of a new research field with massive clin￾ical implications was published ten years ago by Honda et
al [49]. Authors were the first reported the potential use￾fulness of SP-D serum levels in reflecting the disease
activity in a group of patients with different types of ILDs
including IPF and collagen vascular disease – associated
interstitial pneumonia (CVD-IP).

Moreover, KL-6 serological levels have been tested by
Kobayashi et al. [50] whether they can reflect the activity
of pneumonitis seen in different types of ILD and there￾fore used as a tool for the differential diagnosis of this
large set of diseases and the assessment of their response
to treatment. Data derived from this analysis utilizing
ROC curves and cut-off values showed a distinct differen￾tiation between ILDs and non-ILDs based on the periph￾eral KL-6 concentrations as well as a clear correlation of
KL-6 levels with the clinical activity of the ILDs as defined
by a series of conventional criteria. Although these results
create major expectations in the diagnostic field of ILDs,
however it should be noted that an elevation of KL-6 and
SP-D serum levels suggests diagnosis of ILD and does not
establish a specific diagnosis. For these markers to become
truly specific, large evaluation and comparative studies are
required to determine their usefulness in the differential
diagnosis of ILDs.
The first and to best of our knowledge the only so far com￾parative study testing the sensitivity and specificity of
three groups of molecules reported to serve as sensitive
markers for ILDs was conducted by Ohnishi et al [51].
They generated ROC curves and performed a comparative

analysis of the diagnostic values of KL-6, SP-A, SP-D and
MCP-1 in a pool of serum samples derived from patients
with IPF and CVD-IP. Intriguingly, this study demon￾strated for the first time a clear superiority of KL-6 as a
diagnostic marker of ILDs in terms of diagnostic accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio. Interestingly,
results from the statistical analysis confirmed that all four
serum markers are specific markers for IPF and at least
superior to previously described markers such as lactate
dehydrogenase and other collagen products [52].
Although this study adds knowledge of high scientific
rigidity about the status of these peripheral markers as
diagnostic tools, however there are substantial weaknesses
arising from the origin disadvantages of these molecules
as specific biologic markers. More specifically, serum lev￾els of all the four markers can be influenced by the pres￾ence of ILDs other than IPF as well as lung disorders other
than ILDs such as malignancies, systemic inflammations
and fibrosing lung infections [12,53,54]. Nonetheless,
these observations are not to diminish their value as diag￾nostic tools but to illuminate the need for their further
investigation in the context of more detailed studies
searching potential correlation of these markers with the
clinical and radiological findings and adding more spe￾cific information on the differential diagnosis of IPF
among the other 200 members of the ILD group.
Towards this direction Takahashi et al. [55,56] were the
first who attempted to prove a correlation between the SP￾A and SP-D circulating concentrations and the radiologic

findings as well as the disease extent in patients with CVD￾IP and IPF. Authors published two really well done and
heavily informative papers, both of them are reviewed
here.
In the first study [55], results derived by a statistical anal￾ysis using ROC curves and cut-off levels demonstrated
that elevated levels of SP-A and SP-D in patients with pro￾gressive SSc closely reflect in terms of sensitivity and spe￾cificity the presence of ILD on the basis of CT diagnosis.
Moreover these markers increase even in patients with
mild alveolitis not detectable by compatible chest X-ray.
Additionally an interesting finding with major clinical
applications pointed out by authors is that the combina￾tion assay of SP-D circulating concentrations and chest X￾ray is almost equivalent to CT in the detection of ILD and
can potentially serve as a contributor to reduce the risk of
clinicians overlooking ILD complicated by progressive
SSc.
Furthermore, Takahashi et al. [56] estimated the serologi￾cal levels of SP-A and SP-D in IPF patients and correlated
them with the radiological and functional parameters.
Interestingly, accumulated findings from this analysis
demonstrated a positive correlation between serum levels
of both markers and the extent of alveolitis whereas no
correlation was observed with the progression of fibrosis.
Moreover authors showed a statistically significant link
between increased concentrations of SP-D and rapid
decline in pulmonary function tests as well as with higher
rates of mortality. The above findings suggest that these
proteins and especially SP-D may help scientists to shed
further light in the pathologic characteristics of IPF seen in
HRCT and assist as prognostic tool for the final outcome
in applying optimal therapeutic approaches. However,
caveats that should be taken under consideration include
weak correlations of SP-A and SP-D serum levels with the
CT features and inconclusive analysis of the disease mor￾tality and the biomarker serum levels.
Several biologic markers have been studied the past few
years not only to evaluate the disease activity and for dif￾ferential diagnosis of ILDs but also for prediction of the
disease outcome and the effectiveness of the commonly
applied treatment during the accelerated phase of pulmo￾nary fibrosis.
One of the most detailed and informative study in this
field was published by Yokoyama et al [57]. Scrutinizing
for early predictive markers of the therapeutic effects of
high-dose corticosteroids on patients with rapidly deteri￾orating IPF, authors demonstrated that circulating levels
of KL-6 could predict the efficacy of corticosteroids at an
earlier time-point than other studied non-specific mark￾ers, when overall clinical effect may not yet be evident.
However, potential criticisms of this study including the
small number of a specific group of IPF patients studied,
the finding that the KL-6 levels in the pretreatment period
could not be used to predict outcome as well as the evi￾dence that KL-6 concentrations are affected by certain
malignancies [12,53] pose major limitations to these
observations and highlight the necessity for further inves￾tigation and studies.
Currently, the hurdle faced by young physicians that lim￾its the application of blood biomarkers in the daily clini￾cal practice of IPF patients is whether alterations of their
circulating concentrations are specific for IPF or they also
reflect other lung parenchyma abnormalities seen in dif￾ferent ILDs. Several studies have tested the efficacy of
blood biomarkers in differentiating IPF from other ILDs.
Some of them are reviewed here.
One of the first and most extensive studies addressing that
important issue was conducted by Greene et al. [58] in the
context of a large cohort multivariate analysis including
over 200 patients with IPF and progressive SSc and
approximately 200 patients with other ILDs. Notably,
authors showed an important correlation between ele￾vated SP-A and SP-D serological levels in IPF and SSc
patients compared to patients with sarcoidosis or beryl￾lium disease. Furthermore, SP-D levels found to be
strongly related to radiographic abnormalities in patients
with IPF. The most intriguing result of this study was that
both increasing SP-A and SP-D levels were highly predic￾tive of mortality in patients with IPF and progressive SSc
and this finding robust (especially SP-D levels) after
adjustment for many measures of disease severity. How￾ever, a major limitation of this analysis was that serial
measurement of SP-A and SP-D levels during the clinical
course of patients with diffuse lung disease was not defin￾itively evaluated. Hence, an important issue highlighted
by authors that needs further investigation is the useful￾ness of serum alterations in reflecting the disease activity
and extent during different time-points of the disease
course.
To this end Yanaba et al. [59] carried out a longitudinal
retrospective study in a relatively small number of subjects
with SSc and found that the majority of patients with nor￾mal baseline serum KL-6 levels exhibited no deterioration
or new onset of PF whereas patients with dramatically
increased KL-6 levels showed a parallel progression of PF.
The latter observation concerning the utility of KL-6 as a
biomarker in monitoring the clinical course of PF was fur￾ther strengthened by the same group of scientists {Yanaba
et al. [60]} in the context of a comparative study of SP-D
and KL-6 serum levels in a limited number of patients
with SSc. Moreover, by generating ROC curve analysis,

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:78 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/78
Page 10 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)
authors concluded that the combined use of these two
blood markers could be of higher diagnostic and monitor￾ing value for the activity of PF than the single use of each
marker. However, data derived from the last two studies
was inconclusive mainly due to the fact that it was pro￾duced by retrospective analyses and the number of
patients was inadequately small for any meaningful
outcome.
Alternatively, Ishii et al. [61] estimated the diagnostic val￾ues of five lung peripheral biomarkers including SP-A, SP￾D, KL-6 and two tumour markers in discriminating
patients with ILD of various histopathologic patterns such
as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and non-specific
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Ultimately authors dem￾onstrated differential SP-A serum concentrations between
patients with UIP and NSIP indicating a potential role of
this protein for the discrimination of these two members
of ILD group with sometimes similar pathologic and radi￾ologic characteristics but with totally different prognosis
and response to treatment. Although this study adds criti￾cal information on the field of differential diagnosis of
ILDs, however it is of high risk to adapt this evidence in
the everyday clinical practice and make the differential
diagnosis based only on non-invasive methods. It is of
high importance to note that there are substantial weak￾nesses including the relatively small number of patients
used and the overlap in the serum SP-A levels between
UIP and NSIP patients that limit the further application of
these results and illuminate the need for a more extensive
analysis to determine its diagnostic cut-off levels.
To gain a more comprehensive understanding on the
activity of lung epithelial cell damage and repair charac￾terizing IPF and other ILDs and to clear out whether these
are related to the disease prognosis, investigators studied
the significance of other lung specific epithelial proteins
initially reported as tumour markers, in reflecting these
pathological abnormalities. Some of the most extensively
reported markers were CK19 and carbohydrate antigens
sialyl Lewis (Ca 19-9, SLX).
There have been several published papers reporting ele￾vated levels of CK19 in the serum of patients with various
types of ILD [62,63]. Nevertheless, the first report in the
literature demonstrating elevated CK19 serum levels in
patients with different types of ILDs and a significant asso￾ciation with several clinical parameters known to be
strong predictors of the disease clinical course was made
by Dobashi et al [64]. This data combined with results
from immunohistochemical analysis indicate that CK19
is a marker of lung injury. However, it is inconclusive
given the small sample of patients recruited and the major
discrepancies between levels of CK19 and other serologi￾cal predictive parameters. Therefore, the efficacy of CK19
in the differential diagnosis of IPF from other ILDs as well
as in the prediction of the disease prognosis should be fur￾ther evaluated.
Fueled by this prospect, Nakayama et al. [65] were the first
that revealed a positive linkage between increased CK19
serum levels and low survival rate in patients with IPF and
CVD-IP suggesting a potential role for this tumour marker
in reflecting the severity of the lung injury and the disease
prognosis. Additionally, this study clearly documented by
using ROC curves and cut-off levels the ineffectiveness of
this marker to differentiate IPF from other non-malignant
respiratory diseases characterized by marked epithelial
cell damage. This observation coupled with substantial
weaknesses including the lack of adjustment of CK19
serum levels with the disease severity, allow us to make
only speculations on the exact role of this biomarker as a
prognostic factor and warrant consideration.
Elevated plasma levels of Ca 19-9 were first demonstrated
by Bungo et al. [66] in 1988. In addition, Mukae et al. [67]
reported two cases of interstitial pneumonitis with
marked increase of carbohydrate antigens in serum and
BALF, the level of which changed in accordance to their
clinical course. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
the expression of these antigens on bronchiolar epithelial
cells and regenerating epithelial cells which covered the
surface of fibrosing alveolar septi or remodeling septal
structures finding that was further corroborated by
Shimizu et al. [68] who stated elevated serum levels of
cancer-associated antigens (Ca 19-9, SLX) primarily local￾ized in the hyperplastic bronchiolar epithelium and the
surface epithelium cells of microscopic honeycombing in
two different patients with IPF. However, the first study
that tested the clinical usefulness of elevated blood levels
of Ca 19-9 in a series of patients with fibrosing lung dis￾ease was conducted by Satoh et al [69]. In consistency
with previous reports in the literature {Takayama et al.
[70]}, authors demonstrated a strong correlation of serum
levels with the degree of disease activity indicating a
potential role of these molecules as prognostic markers of
disease severity and therapeutic response. Furthermore,
Yokoyama et al. [71] carried out the first comparative
evaluation of the diagnostic values of three serum carbo￾hydrate antigens (KL-6, Ca 19-9, and SLX). They plotted
ROC curves and demonstrated a clear superiority in terms
of specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of KL-6
plasma levels in discriminating interstitial pneumonia
from alveolar pneumonia and healthy volunteers. In
another study, Satoh et al. [72] coupled SLX serum cut-off
levels with Western blotting analysis and documented
that this combination is of high diagnostic power in dif￾ferentiating IPF from lung adenocarcinoma.

Evidence presented give credence to the view that cancer￾associated antigens could serve as valuable and reliable
diagnostic and prognostic markers of ILDs. On the other
hand, none of the studies provided us with established
diagnostic cut-off values since they exhibited low statisti￾cal power and in most of them no adjustment with the
disease severity was performed. Moreover, KL-6 has
proven to have higher discriminative power than carbohy￾drate antigens. In addition, potential arguments include
the lack of knowledge regarding the role of these markers
in the pathogenetic pathway of IPF. So far, the only study
addressed this crucial issue was published by Obayashi et
al. [73] who reported a direct correlation of elevated BALF
Ca 19-9 levels with the percentage of neutrophils suggest￾ing a potential role of carbohydrate antigens as neu￾trophilic chemoattractants and subsequently as
contributors in the process of lung injury. Further analyses
in the context of large prospective studies are warranted to
elucidate this role and establish their clinical usefulness as
markers of disease severity and activity.
The past few years led by the same perspective idea to find
a reliable and reproducible biologic marker for the diag￾nosis and prediction of ILDs, several group of scientists
have tested the usefulness of a slew of cytokines to play
that role.
One of these reports was published by Suga et al [74].
Authors concluded that elevated serum and BAL levels of
MCP-1 could be useful to discriminate IPF among other
members of the ILD group. Interestingly, in circulating
MCP-1 concentrations of patients with IPF underwent
steroid therapy no trend towards fall with treatment was
noticed whereas a major fluctuation in pre-and post-treat￾ment levels was readily identifiable. However, these
results do not prove neither the reproducibility of this
biormarker nor its relationship with the disease behav￾iour. The latter observations coupled with the evidence
that MCP-1 levels are markedly influenced by corticoster￾oid treatment as well as other lung disorders since it is a
mediator of inflammation also produced in other parts of
body, limit its specificity in the differential diagnosis of
ILDs and underline the need for re-evaluation of its pre￾dictive value.
One of the most exciting roles cytokines can play is their
use as indicators of the therapeutic effects of several drugs
against IPF providing investigators with useful knowledge
on the potential mechanisms of these drugs in terms of
physiology and molecular biology highlighting novel
therapeutic targets.
The first study in humans to characterize the effects of
IFN-γ1b on plasma and lung biomarkers, speculated to
serve as critical mediators in the pathogenesis of IPF was
recently published by Strieter et al [75]. Authors docu￾mented indefinite pre- and post-treatment alterations in
the peripheral concentrations of several biologic markers
associated with fibrosis, aberrant vascular modelling and
immunomodulatory activity that can be used only for
generating hypotheses for future research. However, the
strongest finding in this study was the differential eleva￾tion of blood and BAL before and after treatment levels of
ITAC/CXCL-11, a chemokine with multifunctional activi￾ties including antiangiogenic and antimicrobial. Inferen￾tially, this study comprises evidence that mortality in
patients with IPF could be potentially improved through
the versatile protective properties of IFN-γ1b supporting
its therapeutic utility (Tables 3 and 4).
2. Serum biomarkers in occupational and 
environmental diseases (Table 5)
The concept of biomarkers is extensively developed in the
field of occupational and environmental medicine. His￾torically, in epidemiologic research, the link between
exposure and disease was often without knowing the
mechanism or intervening events. The past few years, the
identification of lower levels of exposures and the effec￾tive clinical and public health management of high risk
populations has drugged much of attention. Borm [76]
highlighted the need for methods to monitor early
adverse effects, exposure, and/or susceptibility of individ￾ual subjects due to occupational and environmental
causes and Schulte and Perera [77] nicely reviewed the
need of extending the use of biomarkers to population
studies. The relative inability of the current modalities
including PFTs, questionnaires and physical examina￾tions, to detect early signs of occupationally and environ￾mentally related adverse effects has prompted much
interest in using biochemical, molecular and pathologic
changes as indicators for respiratory diseases [78]. The
conventional approach to validate a biomarker is to relate
a critical effect to exposure or calculated dose. A positive
outcome judged on the marker-effect relationship leads to
nomination of the event as a biomarker. An essential
requirement for a successful biomarker of effect or suscep￾tibility is that it should identify from among all exposed
individuals those most likely to become diseased. Fueled
by this prospect, a framework of studies has been
designed to utilize biomarkers of exposure, susceptibility
and pathophysiological changes as part of the array of
tools available to assess environmental disease.
Borm and co-workers [79,80] evaluated the clinical use￾fulness of antioxidant enzymes, (TNF) and serum type III
procollagen peptide in studies of coal dust-induced lung
disorders, a wide spectrum of diseases including chronic
inflammation and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). In
the first case-control study [79] glutathione levels were
decreased in early stage coal workers pneumoconiosis

(CWP) but increased in patients with PMF indicating a
potential role of anti-oxidant enzymes in the early detec￾tion of inflammatory response to mineral dust exposure.
However, serum alterations of glutathione failed to pre￾dict individual susceptibility since they most likely reflect
a consequence of the disease. With this aim in mind,
authors carried out a second case-control study [80] where
TNF was studied as a potential risk factor and concluded
that TNF release from peripheral blood monocytes
exposed coal mine dust was a marker of individual suscep￾tibility to dust-induced lung fibrosis. The latter observa￾tion corroborated earlier findings [81,82] and supported
the notion that TNF release from monocytes or TNF in
plasma are not associated with actual or cumulative expo￾sure. However, definitive proof must come from a pro￾spective analysis in the context of carefully designed
follow-up study. The only follow-up study that has been
conducted so far {Schins et al. [83]} showed that the min￾ers that had disease progression (PMF) during 5 years
already had high levels of dust-induced monocyte TNF

release at the beginning and no alterations during follow￾up were noticed. This highly informative study excluded
TNF as an exposure marker and suggested that TNF release
is a constitutional marker of the disease prognosis and is
not highly affected by the disease itself. In a fourth study,
Schins and Borm [84] conducted a 5-year prospective
analysis and estimated whether type III procollagen pep￾tide could serve as a valuable predictor of the fibrotic lung
disease progression, outcome or activity. Since no differ￾ences between procollagen serum levels in coal-miners
and non-dust-exposed controls were observed, the inves￾tigators stated that type III procollagen peptide is not a
reliable marker of early effect.
To characterize the nature and extent of coal dust induced
airway injury there is a need for biomarkers useful to
monitor exposure effects. The potential of many cell
mediators as monitoring tools i.e. CC16 [85], antioxi￾dants [79] and several cytokines [80] has been raised
many times. Towards this direction Cobben et al. [86]
studied the role of LDH (a marker of cell damage) as
marker of lung tissue injury. Authors conducted the first
human study describing a considerable elevation of this
enzyme in a group of ex-coalminers and a further associa￾tion with other clinical variables. Additionally, the same
group of investigators [87] evaluated the role of b-glu￾curonidase as marker of phagocytic activity and reported
increased plasma concentrations in a group of coal-min￾ers after 20 years of exposure whereas no correlation with
clinical parameters was observed. The latter data is in line
with the hypothesis that LDH and b-glucuronidase activ￾ity are conceivable markers of disease activity. Potential
criticisms include the retrospective analysis, the lack of
serial measurement and link to disease behaviour. Thus,
these results should be interpreted with care. To deter￾mine the significance of these biological indicators with
regard to the development or progression of CWP a longi￾tudinal prospective design is necessary.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis also called extrinsic allergic
alveolitis is an ILD that may be due to a wide variety of
inhalative antigenic stimuli. To date, the conventional
diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is usually made
on the basis of history of periodically recurring or perma￾nent complaints upon exposure to a specific inhalative
antigen, interstitial abnormalities in both lungs by chest
radiography or HRCT and detection of precipitating anti￾bodies. However, at present, there are few diagnostic pro￾cedures available to confirm the diagnosis and to estimate
the disease activity and most of them are too invasive and
costly for widespread and daily use. With this aim in
mind, Takahashi et al. [88] evaluated serum KL-6 meas￾urement as a biologic marker for farmer's lung disease
(FLD), a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by
the inhalation of moldy antigens. Authors conducted a
large cohort study and clearly documented significant
higher blood KL-6 levels in patients with FLD compared
to the levels of farmers with or without precipitating anti￾bodies. In addition, major findings in this study previ￾ously unknown, include the consistency between KL-6
serum levels in FLD patients and the activity of the disease
as well as the indication that elevated KL-6 concentrations
coupled with conventional diagnostic criteria may detect
subclinical FLD and determine early and effective thera￾peutic interventions. However, to validate whether serum
KL-6 levels reflect the disease activity a larger evaluation of
the specificity and sensitivity of this marker against the
disease behaviour in combination with a definitively esti￾mated serial measurement of its plasma levels are
required.
While its direct role in pathogenesis of immune and
inflammatory responses remains unclear, neopterin's
ability to reflect monocyte and macrophage activation has
been exploited and yet postulated as a marker of the beryl￾lium-specific cell-mediated immune response that leads
to a chronic granulomatous disease, a hypersensitivity dis￾order named chronic beryllium disease (CBD). In the
study of Harris et al. [89] ROC curves were generated to
evaluate the optimum diagnostic accuracy of neopterin's
cut-off levels. Interestingly, authors have found that the
combination of elevated neopterin's serum levels with the
conventional screening test for CBD, beryllium lym￾phocyte proliferation test exhibited an optimized positive
predictive value suggesting neopterin as a valuable
biomarker in discriminating workers with CBD from
these that are only sensitized to beryllium rendering lung
biopsy unnecessary. These results were substantiated by
in-vitro studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
derived by patients with CBD or beryllium exposed work￾ers [90] and an association between serum levels of neop￾terin and clinicolaboratory parameters of the disease
severity was found. However, further confirmatory tests in
large cohorts of patients including serial measurements
and correlation of results with clinical and radiological
findings are essential to determine reliable cut-off values
for the diagnosis of the disease and the assessment of the
progression likelihood (Table 5).
3. Serum biomarkers in other interstitial lung 
diseases (Table 6)
Since lung specific-epithelium proteins reflect the epithe￾lial damage and turnover it has been hypothesized and
ultimately demonstrated that they can be used as effective
circulating markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of the
clinical course of various types of interstitial pneumonitis
including drug-associated, radiation-induced and hyper￾sensitivity pneumonitis. Furthermore, pneumoproteins
have already been introduced as potential valuable
biomarkers in the research field of pediatric ILDs.

Numerous agents including cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic
drugs exert pulmonary toxicity including interstitial pneu￾monitis which several times culminates to a fatal outcome
[91]. Therefore early diagnosis is crucial, since withdrawal
of the implicated drug is usually the most sufficient treat￾ment for drug toxicities, whereas undiagnosed toxicity can
be progressive and fatal.
Ohnishi et al. [92] in their attempt to introduce a specific
and reproducible hallmark for the recognition of different
types of drug-induced lung injury and the prediction of
their clinical course, estimated the plasma concentrations
of KL-6 in 30 patients with drug-associated pneumonitis
classified into four different predominant radiographic
patterns. The remarkable ascertainment of this study was
the demonstration of a high sensitivity relation between
elevated serum KL-6 levels and particular types of lung
injury as well as with their clinical course. However, the
small number of patients included in this study coupled
with discrepancies between serum KL-6 levels and the dis￾ease extent as defined by CT findings comprise major
caveats and illuminate the need for further prospective
studies to determine whether measurement of KL-6 levels
would be beneficial in the monitoring and early detection
of drug-induced ILDs.
Radiation pneumonitis is the most common complica￾tion for thoracic tumours and is classified as an ILD. Since
CT scanning that represents the gold standard diagnostic
procedure for radiation pneumonitis is either not fre￾quently repeatable or often exhibits non-specific findings
hardly to be differentiated from the lung tumour manifes￾tations, a lung specific laboratory test easily repeatable
and reproducible is highly required for the early detection
of radiation-associated lung injury. On the basis of this
conception, Kohno et al. [93] were the first reported that
serum KL-6 levels are a sensitive marker for detecting
severe radiation pneumonitis. Nevertheless, because
authors measured KL-6 serum levels at a few time-points
in each patient's clinical course, data derived from this
study is inconclusive and cannot be applied to firmly cor￾relate circulating KL-6 concentrations with the clinical
course of radiation pneumonitis. Therefore, Goto et al.
[94] to further streamline these observations retrospec￾tively monitored at shorter intervals blood KL-6 levels in
patients with lung cancer who had received radiotherapy
with or without chemotherapy and showed a correlation
with the clinical course of radiation pneumonitis and the
response to treatment. Interestingly, the finding that
serum KL-6 levels in some patients were increased priory
to the clinical and radiological diagnosis of radiation
pneumonitis is particularly noteworthy and should be
kept in mind.

Another study searching for potential indicators for the
early detection of radiation pneumonitis and for monitor￾ing its clinical course was conducted by Takahashi et al
[95]. Remarkably almost all of the patients with radiation
pneumonitis detected by HRCT exhibited significant
increases in both SP-A and SP-D levels which showed high
sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of radia￾tion pneumonitis compared with other conventional hae￾matological laboratory indices. Additionally, an
agreement of SP-A and SP-D plasma levels with the clini￾cal response to steroid therapy was also noted. This data
suggest a possible role of lung-specific epithelial proteins
as a diagnostic tool for the recognition of radiation￾induced lung injury even when its radiographic change is
faint.
However, these studies exhibit major caveats that must be
addressed prior to their further application in the routine
clinical practice. Briefly, we report the small number of
patients studied, the application of chemotherapy prior to
radiotherapy, the absence of serial measurements through
the clinical course of the disease and the evidence that
these proteins (SP-A and KL-6) are neither organ nor dis￾ease specific since they have also been used as markers for
lung adenocarcinoma [18,53]. To confirm the assump￾tions arising from these concerns, further studies are
required.
As mentioned above the spectrum of ILDs includes a large
heterogeneous group of disorders calculating over 200
members with IPF to be the most common form of idio￾pathic ILD. In contrast ILD in children occurs far less fre￾quently and there are no dominant forms [96]. Although
this research field is newly developed a recently published
study by Al-Salmi et al. [97] revealed for the first time ele￾vated serum levels of three candidate biomarkers of the
disease activity and severity including KL-6, SP-A and SP￾D in a group of children with ILDs of various histopatho￾logic patterns. These results corroborate earlier findings by
Kobayashi et al. [98] who reported elevated KL-6 serum
levels in three children with ILD associated with dermato￾myositis. Nonetheless it should be noted that these stud￾ies are deficient because of the small number of patients
recruited and the diversity of the diseases studied. Further￾more, data described here is inconclusive and it ascertains
poor correlation with the functional and the radiological
parameters. More in depth analysis in a large cohort of
patients is required for any meaningful outcome (Table
6).
4. Serum biomarkers in sarcoidosis (Table 7)
Sarcoidosis is a chronic systemic disorder characterized by
the presence of non-caseating granulomas and accumula￾tion of T-lymphocytes and macrophages in multiple
organs [99]. The mechanisms leading to the persistent
accumulation of inflammatory cells and maintain the
alveolitis which may lead to irreversible organ damage are
not fully understood. The classical parameters used in the
management of pulmonary involvement are mainly radi￾ological methods and PFTs which do not gauge alveolitis
but rather pulmonary impairment. Consequently these
parameters have been proved ineffective both for early
diagnosis of the disease and prediction of the response to
treatment. The last twenty years immunological studies
performed with cells obtained by BAL have shed further
light into the pathogenetic mechanisms of sarcoidosis
[100,101] and formed the basis of concepts of its immun￾opathogenesis. To further streamline these concepts and
ameliorate hardships generating from their clinical appli￾cation, several serological parameters including cytokines,
soluble cytokine receptors, enzymes and other serum
components including lung epithelium-specific proteins
were delineated to probe different aspects of inflamma￾tory activity and therefore reflect the disease severity and
help the early diagnosis of progressive disease [45].
Although levels of these markers are closely associated
with the pathogenesis of the disease [102,103], however
the availability of sufficient information as to which of
them is valuable for assessment of the disease severity and
the prediction of clinical deterioration still represents a
bottleneck. From a clinical point of view it is even more
important to know whether sarcoidosis is severe, rather
than active. The latter observation represents the key evi￾dence determining the initiation of treatment. Some of
the most extensive and informative studies addressing this
crucial issue are presented and criticized in this review
article.
One of the first studies attempted to circumvent this prob￾lem was published by Ziegenhagen et al [104]. Authors
scrutinized the efficacy of both BAL and serum parameters
in indicating likelihood of progression in patients with
sarcoidosis and revealed that almost half of the patients
with no indications for steroid therapy who had elevated
sIL-2R plasma levels experienced disease deterioration
whereas none with normal values did. The aforemen￾tioned observation strongly suggests that this immune
parameter could serve as a prognostic guide leading to the
identification of patients with greater risk to relapse and
maybe associated with clinical findings such as the disease
course.
The effectiveness of sIL-2R in evaluating sarcoidosis sever￾ity even in the early stages of the disease was further con￾firmed by another study of the same group of scientists
[105] who clearly reported significantly elevated sIL-2R
concentrations in patients with progressive sarcoidosis.
On the contrary, this evidence was followed by a surpris￾ing finding regarding the ACE serum concentrations
which did not differ significantly between patients with

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:78 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/78

stable or progressing disease indicating a poor predictive
value of this biomarker in sarcoidosis.
In the study of Grutters et al. [106] authors evaluated the
serological concentrations of sIL-2R as marker of disease
activity, severity and prognosis in a well-defined group of
patients with sarcoidosis. Data derived from this study
partially consistent with other studies [107] asserts a pos￾itive correlation between sIL-2R serum levels and the dis￾ease activity and severity and furthermore claims a
predictive value for this serum biomarker. However, this
study was retrospective and major discrepancies between
the latter findings and results derived from older studies
[108] were also notable.
To establish a more reliable association between sIL-2R
and severity of sarcoidosis Rothkrantz-Kos et al. [109]
applied ROC curve analysis and estimated the potential
prognostic and diagnostic value of four inflammatory
markers to predict respiratory severity in a large number of

sarcoidosis patients. Areas under curve indicated that sIL￾2R showed the greatest ability to determine pulmonary
severity as assessed by the highest sensitivity, specificity,
positive and negative predictive values among the
evaluated markers, including C-reactive protein, serum
amyloid A and ACE. Nonetheless, discrepancies between
serum levels of all markers in treated and untreated
patients coupled with the lack of serial measurement
through patients' clinical course pose major limitations to
the reported data which is unable to determine the
potential efficacy of the evaluated markers to reflect
respiratory severity in sarcoidosis patients under treat￾ment in general.
Accumulated evidence from the data presented reveal that
the predictive values of serum ACE in sarcoid patients are
still under consideration and findings derived from these
studies are controversial concerning its usefulness in
assessing the disease severity and predicting the clinical
outcome. Although some investigators suggest that a
rising ACE serum level can predict radiographic relapses
of sarcoidosis [110] others have clearly demonstrated that
ACE appears to be of poor prognostic value [111,112]. In
the aforementioned studies [104,105,109] ACE does not
yield prognostic information. However, several studies in
the literature have addressed this issue and have reported
an extraordinary high variability in serum ACE concentra￾tion in health, which is provoked by numerous factors.
The most important factor, responsible for approximately
25% of this variation is a deletion/insertion polymor￾phism in intron 16 of the ACE gene [113-116]. The
question whether genotype corrected normal values
might be able to increase the reliability of ACE serological
concentrations as a marker of disease activity in sarcoido￾sis remains to be determined by further studies.
The role of chemokines in monitoring the disease behav￾iour and in reflecting the activity of granuloma formation
in sarcoidosis patients has been evaluated and postulated.
Hashimoto et al. [117] were the first who carried out a
longitudinal evaluation of plasma MCP-1 and MIP-1a lev￾els in a rather small number of sarcoid subjects and dem￾onstrated a closely relation between serum levels of the
studied biomarkers and the clinical course of the disease
as defined by radiological and laboratory parameters.
However, further light should be shed onto the role of
these chemokines as markers of the disease activity and
severity as well as their cellular sources and their relation￾ship with the granuloma formation.
To this end Iyonaga et al. [118] in parallel with the eleva￾tion of MCP-1 serum levels in sarcoid individuals and
their linkage with radiographic abnormalities showed by
both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization
that the origin of the increased MCP-1 plasma levels were
the macrophages peripheral to the granulomas suggesting
a role for this molecule as an indicator in estimating the
activity of granuloma formation and subsequently of the
sarcoidosis activity.
Apart from their application as prognostic and diagnostic
tools of IPF and other ILDs the utility of lung-epithelium
specific proteins including KL-6, SP-D and CC16 as bio￾logical markers of the disease activity has been separately
evaluated in sarcoidosis patients. To date, several studies
have addressed this issue and much good work has been
done towards this direction.
The potential usefulness of pneumoproteins and more
specifically KL-6 as true marker in the assessment of sar￾coidosis was initially suggested by Kobayashi et al [119].
Authors were the first demonstrating linkage between
increased KL-6 plasma levels and consistent changes in
conventional clinical and laboratory parameters for the
evaluation of alveolitis activity in sarcoidosis patients sug￾gesting a potential role of KL-6 as an indicator of the dis￾ease severity.
Moreover Hermans et al. [120] scrutinized the role of
CC16 as a valuable tool for the non-invasive evaluation of
the damage and consequently the integrity of the air￾blood barrier associated with sarcoidosis, shedding
further light into pathogenetic mechanisms underlying
the disease severity. Among other findings authors dem￾onstrated that CC16 serum levels are influenced by the
pulmonary extent of the disease as defined by the radio￾logical abnormalities indicating a potential role of this
molecule as a non-invasive and easily reproducible
parameter for the assessment of the disease severity. On
the other hand, blood levels of this protein reflect not
only the rate of entry into the circulation, but also the rate
of clearance since it has been reported that CC16 is rapidly
eliminated by glomerular filtration [121]. Authors
addressed this issue and found that the increase occurred
independently of the impaired renal function, attributing
the elevation to the leakage of the protein into the blood￾stream across the air-blood barrier. Further studies are
warranted to establish this notion.
Although these markers have been studied separately
[41,119,120] no study so far had performed a compara￾tive analysis of their diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.
Triggered by the latter perspective idea Janssen et al. [122]
recently published a really well done and informative
paper comparing the ability of these three markers to
reflect pulmonary disease severity and prognosis in sar￾coidosis patients. They performed a ROC curve analysis
which revealed a better sensitivity for KL-6 in discriminat￾ing sarcoidosis patients, results consistent with previous
findings [51]. However, as it pointed out from the authors

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:78 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/78
Page 18 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)
KL-6 and CC16 are not ILD-specific markers [[26,53], and
[121]] and evidence that supports their predictive value is
inconclusive since the analysis was retrospective and no
serial measurement was performed (Table 7).
Future challenges and limitations
ILDs represent a diverse group of lung diseases comprising
over 200 different members that have been broadly classi￾fied into several categories [114]. IPF accounting for 46%
of all ILD diagnoses in men and women [124] is rapidly
becoming one of the most lethal non-malignant lung dis￾orders in the Western world with incidence that over￾comes 30 new cases per 100.000 persons per year and
with mean survival 3–5 years regardless of treatment [47].
On the other hand several patients with sarcoidosis
develop irreversible lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis
which culminates to a fatal outcome. The past 15 years,
their devastating incidence and clinical seriousness have
stimulated innumerable research studies, with any possi￾ble approach (Figure 1). Currently, the most fruitful appli￾cation is monitoring the disease activity and consequently
the early detection of patients with increased likelihood of
non-response to treatment and progressive disease. Never￾theless, there are problems with the sensitivity, effort￾dependability and mainly the ease of repetition of the cur￾rent modalities being used for this purpose, including
BAL, pulmonary function tests and HRCT.
Therefore, a major challenge would be the determination
of a reliable serologic marker reflecting the disease behav￾iour before it becomes obvious in clinical level, easily
reproducible and feasible to be measured serially, mean￾ing to be acceptable by the patient. The early serial meas￾urement of this biomarker may lead to an early detection
of relapse and thereby allow anti-inflammatory and other
treatments to be evaluated or eventually modified before
they have failed. The latter components can potentially
compile a clinician's "wish list". On the basis of this con￾ception, an important number of serum markers either
lung-specific proteins and cancer-associated antigens or
cytokines and other serological parameters probing differ￾ent aspects of the immunopathogenesis of ILDs has been
delineated. Initial reports of these markers shed further
light into the pathophysiology of ILDs,
[75,107,108,119,120,122] improved diagnostic and
prognostic capabilities [55-58,61,74,107-111] and ulti￾mately, led to a better patient care. Although the applica￾tions of these markers in the clinical setting created major
expectations, however the feeling of excitement comes in
contrast with important deficiencies exhibited by the new
methodologies including non-standardization tech￾Figure 1 Diagram showing the number of published papers regarding serum biomarkers in patients with ILDs the last fifteen years

niques, lack of knowledge of reproducibility and link to
disease behaviour. Moreover, most of the studies enrolled
a limited number of patients, insufficient to extract any
meaningful or statistically significant outcome. In addi￾tion, it should be noted that many of the caveats arising
from these findings are generated by the origin disadvan￾tages of the investigated serological parameters to serve as
ILD-specific markers since the most of them are influ￾enced by malignancies [12,34,35,53], inflammatory dis￾eases [54], or other lung disorders [26,121]. Furthermore,
although the majority of them showed a moderate to high
clinical utility as detectors of lung disease and correlated
relatively well with the disease severity, however they
failed to serve as reliable prognosticators of decline or
responsiveness to therapy whereas evidence derived from
the evaluation of their histospecific diagnostic accuracy is
scarce and limited [61] (Table 8). Additionally, the eleva￾tion of biomarkers designed to reflect disease severity is
likely to mirror not only the increased rate of entry into
the circulation across the damaged air-blood barrier, but
also the decreased clearance resulting from significant
renal dysfunction seen in ILD patients [120,121]. Finally,
it is of high importance to note that unfortunately only
the minority of the studies [42,51,55,56,65,109,122] clar￾ified the effectiveness and the diagnostic accuracy of the
biomarkers by applying ROC curve analysis which is
essential to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a
marker and moreover to define its discriminative cut-off
levels. The aforementioned observations coupled with the
evidence that the pathogenesis or even the definitions of
ILDs and mainly IPF still remain poorly understood and
ambiguous and therefore the role of all these molecules
associated with their pathogenetic mechanisms has not
been yet well determined, may explain the several limita￾tions in the clinical use of serum markers.
Furthermore, the application of biological markers in the
research field relevant to occupational and environmental
lung disorders have raised some additional concerns.
Most of the studies exhibited major limitations including
the retrospective analysis, the heterogeneity of the studied
population and the lack of serial measurements necessary
for the adjustment to disease behaviour and the link to
disease prognosis. The only so far follow-up study [83]
identified cytokine release as a reliable prognosticator of
the disease progression. For biomarkers to become a use￾ful addition to the array of tools for investigating occupa￾tional and environmental lung diseases appropriate and
carefully designed study populations together with inter￾disciplinary collaborations and financial supports are
required. Nevertheless, ethical, legal and social issues of
human experimentation that arise with the application of
biomarkers need to be considered prior to conducting
studies [78].
Collectively, these findings highlight the necessity for fur￾ther validation prospective studies and the assessment of
novel molecules [75] to serve as diagnostic and prognostic
tools as well as markers of the disease activity and severity.
The recent application of massive genome screening tools
such as DNA microarrays in the respiratory research field
[125] has led to an increase rate of discovery of genes
involved in the disease initiation and progression.
Thereby, the next challenge arising from the emerging of
hundreds of candidate biological markers is the applica￾tion of the genome discoveries in the clinical setting with
the use of tissue microarrays [126] in order to establish
their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic importance
and lead to a better understanding of the biological char￾acteristics of ILDs.
Conclusion
Currently, the application status for most of these biologic
markers is still in its infancy and remains exploratory.
Unfortunately, they do not yield indications for therapy
or mark the end of the inflammatory process and their
prognostic value still needs to be established. Although
the majority of them have not yet lived up to the "great

hype" that was generated, lung-epithelium specific pro￾teins and mostly KL-6 and SP-D show the greatest promise
in IPF and other ILDs whereas serum cytokines seem to be
not ready for routine monitoring. As for sarcoidosis,
despite the controversial aspects regarding the usefulness
of ACE in reflecting the disease activity, it still remains the
most reliable and well defined marker whereas sIL-2R rep￾resents one of the most fruitful applications. Finally, in
occupational and environmental lung disorders the only
so far follow-up study supports TNF release as a valuable
predictor of the fibrotic disease progression, outcome and
activity (Table 8).
Further prospective investigations, technical improve￾ments and introduction of novel markers are warranted in
order to elevate the association of serum biomarkers with
the pathogenesis of ILDs in the same status as for tumour
markers with lung cancer. Nonetheless, crossing the
boundary from research to clinical application requires
validation in multiple settings, experimental evidence
supporting a pathophysiologic role, and ideally interven￾tion trials showing that modification improves the out￾come. The emergence of pioneering technologies
including DNA and tissue microarrays which have already
been applied with great success in the respiratory research
field can help scientists to circumvent this problem and
bridge this boundary. In the interim, these markers can be
quite useful to supplement the clinical, radiological and
physiological monitoring of the disease and identify high￾risk patients who would benefit from aggressive manage￾ment of established risk factors.
