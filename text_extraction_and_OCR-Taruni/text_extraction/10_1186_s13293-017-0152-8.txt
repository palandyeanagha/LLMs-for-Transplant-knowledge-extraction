Abstract
Epidemiologic studies have previously suggested that premenopausal females have reduced incidence of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) when compared to age-matched males, and the incidence and severity of CVD increases postmenopause.
The lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in women during reproductive age is attributed at least in part to estrogen
(E2). E2 binds to the traditional E2 receptors (ERs), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), as well
as the more recently identified G-protein-coupled ER (GPR30), and can exert both genomic and non-genomic actions.
This review summarizes the protective role of E2 and its receptors in the cardiovascular system and discusses its underlying
mechanisms with an emphasis on oxidative stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and vascular function. This review also presents
the sexual dimorphic role of ERs in modulating E2 action in cardiovascular disease. The controversies surrounding the
clinical use of exogenous E2 as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular disease in women due to the possible risks of
thrombotic events, cancers, and arrhythmia are also discussed. Endogenous local E2 biosynthesis from the conversion of
testosterone to E2 via aromatase enzyme offers a novel therapeutic paradigm. Targeting specific ERs in the cardiovascular
system may result in novel and possibly safer therapeutic options for cardiovascular protection.

Background
While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause
of death among women, epidemiologic studies indicate
that females prior to menopause are somewhat protected
against the development of CVD when compared to men.
Women have reduced incidence of CVD when compared
to age-matched males and present with CVD 10 years
later than men [1]. In response to aortic stenosis, males
have significantly more maladaptive cardiac remodeling
than women, and transcriptome characterization reveals
that fibrosis and inflammation-related genes and pathways
are upregulated in males but not in females [2].
Premenopausal women also withstand ischemia/reperfu￾sion (I/R) injury during open heart surgery better than
males [3]. Female protection against CVD is associated
with sex hormone levels as the incidence and severity of
CVD increases in women postmenopause [3], and the
prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is greater in
young women who had an oophorectomy compared to
those with intact ovaries [4]. Taken together, this data has
sparked much investigation into the potential of female
sex hormones in conferring cardioprotection. The results
of years of research into female sex hormones indicate
that the main circulating female hormone, estrogen (E2),
is cardioprotective through a plethora of mechanisms that
are highlighted throughout this review. While there is
abundant data supporting E2 as a cardoprotective agent in
experimental models of CVD, E2 replacement therapy in
postmenopausal women has been very controversial [5].

Furthermore, while postmenopausal women are at greater
risk than premenopausal women of developing CVD,
women still have significantly lower incidence of CVD
compared to age-matched men well beyond menopause
[6]. Discrepancies in the development and prognosis of
CVD indicate that the cardioprotection conferred by E2 in
females is complex and potentially not the only sex￾biasing factor, as other sex-biasing factors such as the sex
chromosome composition are also known to contribute to
sex biases in CVD [6–8]. The purpose of this review is to
summarize the role of E2, E2 receptors (ERs), and aroma￾tase in experimental models of CVD as well as highlight
the controversies of hormone replacement therapy in
women. We also present the sexual dimorphic role of ERs
in modulating E2 action in CVD.
Estrogen and estrogen receptors
Estradiol, also known as 17beta-estradiol or estro￾gen (E2), is the most abundant form of circulating estro￾gens and considered the main female hormone. Two
other naturally occurring forms occur in lower abun￾dance (estrone (E1) and estriol (E3)), while a third form
(estretrol (E4)) is produced only during pregnancy [9].
E2 is predominantly synthesized and secreted by the
ovaries in premenopausal women. Some E2 is also pro￾duced in other tissue types including adipose, brain, and
bone tissues as well as the vascular endothelium and
aortic smooth muscle cells [10]. While gonadal E2 acts
largely as an endocrine factor affecting distal tissues, ex￾tragonadal production of E2 acts locally as a paracrine
or intracrine factor in the tissue where it is synthesized
[10]. This extragonadal E2 production plays an import￾ant role, as it remains the only source of endogenous E2
production in postmenopausal women and men [10].
E2 binds to the traditional ERs, ERα and ERβ, as well
as the newly identified G-protein-coupled ER (GPR30)
[11] (Fig. 1). Binding to ERα and ERβ can confer both
genomic and rapid non-genomic action [12]. In the gen￾omic pathway, E2 binding triggers intracellular
localization of ERα and ERβ, which dimerize and enter
the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, they bind to E2 re￾sponse elements (ERE), or activator protein-1 (Ap1) and
specificity protein-1 (Sp1), on the promoter of E2-
responsive genes to regulate transcription. E2 also binds
to membrane-bound ERα and ERβ receptors as well as
GPR30 to rapidly activate nuclear transcription factors
Fig. 1 Genomic and non-genomic actions of E2. E2 can regulate gene expression and activity of signaling molecules by binding to ERs via gen￾omic and/or non-genomic pathways. In genomic regulation, binding of E2 to the ER promotes the formation of homo/hetero dimers, transloca￾tion to the nucleus and direct binding to estrogen response elements (ERE), or to transcription factors which regulate transcription of its target
genes including VEGF, a pro-angiogenic factor. In non-genomic regulation, binding of E2 to ERs and GPR30 at the plasma membrane leads to activa￾tion of MAPK/ERK/PI3K/cAMP, which induce gene expression including eNOS, a potent vasodilator. E2 also binds to ERs localized on the mitochondrial
membrane improving mitochondrial function by decreasing ROS production and increasing cell survival. Local E2 biosynthesis from the conversion of T to
E2 via aromatase (CYP450) is also shown. Genomic pathways are shown in red arrows, whereas non-genomic pathways are shown in blue arrows.

via the MAPK pathway. The E2 pathway is summarized
in Fig. 1.
While still considered controversial by some, all three
E2 receptors have been identified as functional and
present in adult cardiomyocytes [11, 13–15]. The role of
each ER and the mechanism by which it confers cardio￾protection is actively being investigated in various ani￾mal models, and the current findings will be
summarized in the following sections of this review.
Estrogen, mitochondria, and oxidative stress
Heart failure (HF) and ischemic heart injury are linked
to several bioenergetic abnormalities including decreased
energy metabolism, increased apoptosis, production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and dysfunctional cal￾cium signaling. These abnormalities can largely be at￾tributed to changes in mitochondrial homeostasis [16,
17]. Both traditional ERs and GPR30 are localized on the
mitochondrial membrane in cardiac tissue, and activa￾tion of these receptors via E2 can trigger transcriptional
changes in nuclear and mitochondrial genes influencing
mitochondrial function, cell survival, and ultimately
cardioprotection [18, 19]. While the beneficial role of E2
in cardioprotection has been demonstrated in both male
and female rodents, there is growing evidence demon￾strating that E2-induced cardioprotection via mitochon￾drial homeostasis and oxidative stress may exhibit sex
differences.
Lagranha et al. found that adult female rats are pro￾tected against ex vivo I/R injury in the presence of E2 as
they had smaller infarct size and increased cardiac con￾tractility compared to female rats without gonadal E2
(post ovariectomy, OVX) [20]. Male rats with E2 treat￾ment were also protected against I/R injury with smaller
infarct and higher cardiac contractility than non-treated
controls. Mitochondria from both females and E2-
treated males had increased levels of PKC-dependent
phosphorylation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2)
resulting in increased ALDH activity. Activation of
ALDH has previously been reported to protect the heart
against ischemic damage [21]. Lagranha et al. also inves￾tigated if E2 conferred cardioprotection via activation of
PI3K signaling pathway. Pretreatment of hearts with the
PI3K inhibitor wortmannin diminished the cardioprotec￾tion in female rats following I/R injury as well as re￾duced p-ALHD2 [20]. This study also linked increased
p-ALHD2 to decreased ROS production and found that
cardiomyocytes from female rats had less ROS produc￾tion than cardiomyocytes from male rats following I/R
injury [20].
A study by Zhai et al. highlighted the protective role
of ERα in male mice following global myocardial I/R by
comparing male ERα knockout (ERKO) and wild-type
mice [22]. Following ischemia, the hearts of ERKO mice
had lower functional recovery, higher incidence of fibril￾lation and/or tachycardia, and a significantly lower cor￾onary flow rate leading to larger infarct size compared
to wild-type mice. Transmission electron microscopy re￾vealed that ERKO hearts had swollen and fragmented
mitochondria with loss of matrix and ruptured cristae
[22]. Functionally, the mitochondria isolated from ERKO
hearts were found to have more severe respiratory dys￾function than wild-type controls [22]. This study dem￾onstrates that ERα plays a cardioprotective role against
I/R injury in male mice and that the abolishment of ERα
promotes I/R injury via impaired calcium influx and
mitochondrial dysfunction. The importance of ERα in
mediating E2 cardioprotection has also been identified
in females as well. In an in vivo model of I/R using adult
female rabbits, acute pretreatment with E2 or ERα￾specific agonist PPT, but not ERβ-specific agonist DPN,
significantly decreased infarct size suggesting that ERα
plays a significant role in the acute cardioprotective ac￾tion of E2 [12, 23].
E2 also mediates cardioprotection through GPR30 acti￾vation on the mitochondrial surface. Bopassa et al. found
that during I/R injury, GPR30 activation by E2 in adult
male mice results in cardioprotection by inhibiting the
opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(mPTP) via activation of the ERK pathway [11]. E2 bind￾ing to GPR30 activates adenylyl cyclase, mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK), and extracellular signal￾regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, resulting in
mobilization of intracellular calcium [24]. The mPTP ap￾pears to play a pivotal role in apoptosis following I/R [25].
During ischemia, the mPTP remains closed and opens
during the first few minutes of reperfusion due to oxida￾tive stress, calcium overload, and ATP depletion [26].
Bopassa et al. found that in the presence of the GPR30
agonist G-1, mouse hearts had better functional recovery
as well as a smaller infarct size. Furthermore, the presence
of G-1 allowed for the mitochondria to uptake more cal￾cium prior to the opening of the mPTP. All the protective
effects of GPR30 activation were blocked by ERK inhib￾ition indicating that GPR30 confers cardioprotection by
inhibiting the opening of the mPTP via ERK activation
[11].
In agreement with the beneficial role of E2 on the
heart, studies have shown a detrimental effect of E2 de￾pletion via OVX on cardioprotection. Pavón et al. found
that following OVX, mitochondria from adult female
rats have decreased Ca2+ retention capacity, which is re￾stored when mitochondria are incubated with E2, thus
indicating a protective role of E2 against ischemic injury
[27]. A later study by Pavón et al. found that in the ab￾sence of E2, female rats also exhibit increased mitochon￾drial dysfunction: mitochondria were more susceptible
to stress-induced dysfunction of complex I and exhibited
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 3 of 16

significant changes in the oxidative phosphorylation￾related proteins including cytochrome c oxidase and
ATP synthase [28]. Finally, Pavón et al. also reported
that E2 is protective against damaging oxidative stress
resulting from lipid peroxidation and free radical forma￾tion. They showed that levels of thiobarbituric acid re￾active substances (TBARS) were increased following I/R
injury in OVX females when compared to intact
females. The expression of TBARS was also greatly re￾duced in intact females compared to intact males [27]. A
study by Liu et al. suggests that higher levels of circulat￾ing E2 in female rodents may protect against cardiovas￾cular stressors due to increased antioxidant expression
[30]. Intact female mice were found to have in￾creased cardiac levels of the antioxidant mitochondrial
superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) when compared to male
mice. Following OVX, SOD2 expression decreased to
match that of males, and E2 therapy in OVX female
mice resulted in increased SOD2 expression. Further￾more, OVX mice fed high-fat diet produced more aortic
ROS than intact and E2-treated females fed high-fat diet.
E2 stimulated the expression of SOD2 through both
classical ERs [30].
A study by Wang et al. further highlighted the anti￾oxidative effects of E2 in cardioprotection. The study
found that activation of ERα by E2 in cardiomyocytes
decreased levels of microRNA 22 (miR-22) through
Sp1 coactivation [29]. Decreased miR-22 expression
resulted in an upregulation of cystathionine γ-lyase
(CSE) in cardiomyocytes. CSE is known to be upregu￾lated in the myocardium of female rats and in rats
treated with E2 and confers cardioprotection by in￾creasing synthesis of the antioxidant hydrogen sulfide
[30]. Additionally, female cardiomyocytes are also
protected against oxidative stress via ERα-mediated
activation of AKT/GSK-3β and AKT/Bcl-2 and inhib￾ition of caspase 3 [31].
In summary, E2 increases cardioprotection against I/R
injury and high-fat diet by improving mitochondrial
function and reducing ROS mainly through ERα and
GPR30 (Fig. 2). E2-enhanced mitochondrial structure
and function by activating the cardioprotective signaling
pathways (PI3K/ERK1/2) and inhibiting mPTP opening.
E2 reduces ROS production and protects against oxida￾tive stress by increasing the production of powerful anti￾oxidants SOD2 and hydrogen sulfide.

Estrogen and fibrosis
Myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), growth factors, and cyto￾kines are mainly produced by cardiac fibroblasts, all of
which contribute to the myocardial structure mainten￾ance as well as cardiac remodeling in diseased hearts
[32]. Cardiac remodeling is manifested by changes in the
size, shape, and function of the heart including cardio￾myocyte hypertrophy, fibroblast proliferation, fibrosis, an
accumulation of fibrillar collagens, and myocyte apop￾tosis [33]. Increased expression of fibrillar collagens
leads to stiffening and electrical uncoupling of the car￾diac muscle impeding both relaxation and contraction of
the heart. Furthermore, increased levels of fibrosis cause
a decrease in angiogenesis in the heart as well as an in￾crease of oxygen diffusion distance, thus leading to myo￾cyte hypoxia [34].
The normal ECM, mainly composed of type I and type
III collagens, plays an important adaptive role in HF by
preventing excessive dilatation when ventricular over￾load occurs. An imbalance in the synthesis and/or inhib￾ition in the expression of ECM proteins results in
fibrosis. In the pressure overloaded ventricles, cardio￾myocyte hypertrophy is accompanied by increased colla￾gen deposition between and around myocytes, resulting
in interstitial and perivascular fibrosis [35]. The ECM is
enzymatically digested by MMPs, and an imbalance of
collagen deposition and the activity or expression of
MMPs can lead to cardiac remodeling. In the normal
heart, the majority of cells are fibroblasts [36], and exter￾nal stressors cause fibroblasts to change their phenotype
to myofibroblasts, which plays a pivotal role in inflam￾mation and fibrosis [32].
A study by Lee and Eghbali-Webb first investigated
the expression of the classic ERs in cardiac fibroblasts
isolated from female rats. The study found that both
ERα and ERβ are expressed in fibroblasts, with the pre￾dominant receptor being ERβ which is expressed in the
cytosol and nucleus [37]. Lee and Eghbali-Webb also
found that treatment of fibroblasts with E2 increases
DNA synthesis, which was prevented in the presence of
tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator with high inhibi￾tory affinity for both ERs in the heart. This upregulation
of DNA synthesis occurs through nuclear translocation
of receptor protein and activation of MAPK [37]. These
data suggest that E2 acts on the fibroblasts to regulate
ECM remodeling and modulate myocardial function via
ER and MAPK-dependent mechanisms. Paradoxically,
another early study by Dubey et al. found that E2 inhib￾ited fetal calf serum-induced fibroblast proliferation and
collagen synthesis in both male and female rats [38].
Furthermore, the E2 metabolites 2-hydroxyestradiol and
2-methoxyestradiol were found to be even more potent
than E2 in inhibiting fibroblast proliferation and collagen
synthesis, and these effects were enhanced in the pres￾ence of progesterone and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (a high￾affinity ER ligand) [38]. Considering that the results were
similar in both sexes, E2 inhibition of fibroblast prolifer￾ation is most likely not acting in a sex-specific manner
[38].
Recent studies further support the anti-fibrotic effect
of E2 in the heart. Pedram et al. found that ERβ activa￾tion prevents cardiac fibrosis by blocking the effects of
angiotensin II (AngII) and endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced
pro-fibrotic signaling in female mice [39]. AngII and ET￾1 promote cardiac fibrotic deposition by driving the
transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and stimulat￾ing the synthesis of transforming growth factor-β1
(TGFβ1), a potent inducer of cardiac fibrosis. Upregula￾tion of TGFβ1 in the myofibroblast leads to production
of vimentin, fibronectin, and collagens I and III. E2, as
well as an ERβ agonist, inhibit TGFβ1 through cAMP
and protein kinase A. E2 inhibits fibrosis through ERβ as
E2 administration was shown to prevent AngII-induced
cardiac fibrosis in female OVX wild-type (WT) mice but
not in ERβ knockout mice [39]. Therefore, this study
demonstrated the strong anti-fibrotic effects of ERβ acti￾vation via E2.
Recent work by our lab found that E2 treatment re￾verses fibrotic deposition induced by the transaortic con￾striction model of HF in male mice [40]. E2 treatment
diminished the expression of pro-fibrotic genes that are
increased in response to cardiac pressure overload includ￾ing collagens I and III, TGFβ1, lysil oxidase, and fibrosin.
E2 treatment resulted in an upregulation of ERβ transcript
expression which could elucidate the mechanism by which
E2 exerts its effects inhibiting fibrosis [40]. Our study fur￾ther contributed to the growing body of evidence
highlighting E2 as a powerful inhibitor of profibrotic genes
that are detrimental to cardiac function.
To study the effect of ERs on fibrosis in the in vivo I/R
injury model, mice with overexpression of either ERα or
ERβ were subjected to left anterior descending (LAD) cor￾onary artery ligation and subsequent reperfusion. Mah￾moodzadeh et al. found that cardiac fibrosis was attenuated
in female mice overexpressing ERα after they were sub￾jected to LAD ligation [41]. This suggests that ERα has an
important role in protecting the hearts of female rodents
against ischemic insults. Another study by Schuster et al.
examined the role of ERβ in regulating myocardial infarct
size post-LAD [42]. They found that cardiomyocyte￾specific ERβ overexpression led to improved heart function
and survival in both sexes. Interestingly, male mice with
ERβ overexpression had increased left ventricular (LV) vol￾ume and EF with reduced cardiac fibrosis when compared
to female mice overexpressing ERβ.
The more recently investigated GPR30 may also play a
role in conferring cardioprotection via anti-fibrotic
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 5 of 16

mechanisms. Wang et al. found that GPR30 activation
via G-1 prevented cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fi￾brosis both in vitro and in vivo. They demonstrated that
cultured cardiac fibroblasts from male rats displayed
GPR30 at the cell surface and treatment with G-1 re￾duced proliferation. In vivo, G-1 treatment attenuated
the adverse interstitial collagen deposition and fibroblast
proliferation resulting from high-salt diet or E2 deple￾tion from OVX in female rats [43].
MMP-2, which exhibits increased expression and activ￾ity following aortic stenosis, myocardial infarction (MI),
and LV hypertrophy, is believed to have an adverse effect
on cardiac remodeling [44–47]. Furthermore, constitutive
expression of MMP-2 causes systolic dysfunction and se￾vere remodeling [48], while its inhibition attenuates car￾diac remodeling and improves survival after MI or
pressure overload [49–51]. Mahmoodzadeh et al. found
that E2 significantly reduced MMP-2 gene expression in
male and female adult rat and human fibroblasts via acti￾vation of the classic ERs. This effect was due to E2-
dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor
Elk-1 via the MAPK signaling pathway [44]. Thus, E2-
induced repression of MMP-2 may contribute to sex dif￾ferences in fibrotic processes, although the authors did
not note sex differences in MMP-2 expression.
Lastly, our group has shown that E2 and ERβ activa￾tion reverse right ventricular failure caused by
pulmonary hypertension (PH) in intact male rats [52].
Right ventricular (RV) failure was associated with upreg￾ulation of ECM-interacting cardiac fetal gene osteopon￾tin. We found that the transcript levels of two novel
ECM-degrading disintegrin-metalloproteinases (ADAM),
ADAM15 and ADAM17, as well as osteopontin and
phosphorylated AKT were all elevated in the failing RV
and E2 therapy after the onset of PH reversed these ef￾fects likely through ERβ activation [52].
In summary, E2 has been demonstrated to have a sig￾nificant role in ECM remodeling by acting on fibroblasts
via ER and MAPK-dependent mechanisms (Fig. 2). Recent
data demonstrates that E2 protects against cardiac fibrosis
and harmful ECM remodeling by altering fibroblast prolif￾eration and inhibiting various pro-fibrotic genes.
Estrogen and angiogenesis
By definition, angiogenesis is the physiological process
by which new blood vessels form from pre-existing ves￾sels. E2 has previously been shown to be pro-angiogenic
in various tissues including the uterus, breast, brain, and
limbs [53–55]. Increased cardiac angiogenesis is neces￾sary to maintain LV function during adaptive hyper￾trophy and compensated heart hypertrophy as the larger
LV has an obvious need for more blood vessels [56, 57].
However, an imbalance between cardiac growth and
neoangiogenesis over time can induce the progression of
compensated heart hypertrophy to HF [58]. It is there￾fore postulated that stimulation of cardiac neoangiogen￾esis could be vital in preventing the transition to HF.
Several agents have been shown to induce angiogen￾esis. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, particu￾larly FGF-1 and FGF-2, are potent angiogenic growth
factors that promote endothelial proliferation and
organization into tubular structures [59, 60]. Vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important angio￾genic factor and a critical determinant of capillary
growth and density [61]. When bound to its receptor,
VEGF starts a signaling cascade which stimulates nitric
oxide synthase 3 (eNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) produc￾tion, endothelial cell proliferation, migration of tube
structures, and differentiation into mature blood vessels
[61, 62]. We recently showed that VEGF transcript levels
are significantly downregulated (~ 5-fold) in male mice
with HF and exogenous E2 treatment after establishment
of HF was able to restore VEGF expression in the LV
[40]. Furthermore, we showed that E2 therapy in male
mice significantly enhanced capillary density by ~ 4-fold
compared to the HF group alone [40]. Stimulation of
cardiac neoangiogenesis by E2 in HF is not only limited
to the LV, as E2 also stimulates angiogenesis in RV fail￾ure secondary to PH in male rats [67]. Both studies
found that E2 was no longer able to rescue HF in the
presence of an angiogenesis inhibitor, which indicates
that E2 protects against LV and RV HF in male rodents
by stimulating angiogenesis [40, 63].
In agreement with our finding, E2 has also been shown
to promote vascularization in the experimental model of
myocardial ischemic injury. Iwakura et al. showed that
E2 augments the incorporation of endothelial progenitor
cells (EPCs) in the sites of cardiac ischemic vascularization,
resulting in protection from ischemic injury [64]. Using
OVX female mice pretreated with placebo or E2 prior to
MI induced by LAD ligation, the group found that E2 in￾duced a significant increase in circulating EPCs, which led
to an increase in cardiac capillary density. The study also
found a greater preponderance of EPCs in the E2-treated
animals at the ischemic sites [64]. E2 failed to increase
homing of EPCs to the injured myocardium in eNOS-null
mice [68]. Therefore, E2 maintains the integrity of ischemic
heart tissue by increasing the mobilization and incorpor￾ation of EPCs by eNOS. The same group then investigated
the role of ERα and ERβ in the E2-induced mobilization of
EPCs, which favorably affected neovascularization post car￾diac ischemic injury [65]. The study found that the E2-
induced endothelial migration, tube formation, and adhe￾sion were impaired when using EPCs derived from ERα or
ERβ KO female mice; however, the impairment was more
severe when EPCs were derived from ERα KO mice. When
bone marrow was transplanted from either ERα or ERβ KO
female mice into WT female mice, capillary density at the
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 6 of 16

ischemic border zone was significantly reduced when com￾pared to bone marrow transplanted from WT female mice.
ERα transcript levels were more abundant than ERβ in
EPCs, and VEGF expression was downregulated only in the
ERα knockout EPCs both in vivo and in vitro when com￾pared to WT [65]. Thus, both ERα and ERβ contribute to
E2-induced EPC mobilization and preservation of cardiac
function in female mice following MI, but ERα plays a
more predominant role in this cardioprotective process.
Interestingly, a study by Mahmoodzadeh et al. using
intact male and female mice with a cardiomyocyte￾specific overexpression of ERα found that ERα increases
expression of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
markers (such as VEGF and Lyve-1) and neovasculariza￾tion in the peri-infarct area following MI in a sex￾specific manner. Only female mice overexpressing ERα
exhibited 100% survival 14 days post-MI concomitant
with reduced pathological cardiac remodeling when
compared to male mice overexpressing ERα and wild￾type mice of both sexes [41]. Thus, ERα overexpression
increased cardiac angiogenesis and induced cardiopro￾tection in females, but was not sufficient to confer cardi￾oprotection in males which is likely a result of the
increased circulating E2 in females.
In summary, stimulation of neoangiogenesis by E2
therapy in the heart plays an important role in prevent￾ing the transition from compensated hypertrophy to HF
in both the LV and RV. E2 therapy in HF rodents stimu￾lates neoangiogenesis by enhancing VEGF expression,
which is normally suppressed during HF, and increasing
capillary density in the heart (Fig. 2). Induction of
neoangiogenesis via E2 therapy is dependent on eNOS
activation, as eNOS-null mice do not exhibit the pro￾angiogenic effects following E2 therapy. Moreover, ERα
plays a more dominant role than ERβ in E2-induced
EPC activation, upregulation of VEGF transcripts, and
preservation of cardiac function post MI, and overex￾pression of ERα in cardiomyocytes is protective against
MI in female but not male mice.
Estrogen and vasodilation
Under healthy conditions, the vascular endothelium
plays an important role in maintaining vascular tone and
blood flow. When dysfunctional, the endothelium pro￾motes inflammation, prothrombotic factors, and vaso￾constriction, which increase the risk of developing CVD
[66–69]. Reports show that E2, when bound to either
classical ERs or GPR30, can help maintain endothelial
homeostasis and vasodilation by activating the transcrip￾tion of eNOS and subsequent upregulation of NO
through genomic and non-genomic pathways [5, 70–72].
While the effect of E2 on the vascular endothelium is
largely time and tissue dependent, studies show that
some of the cardioprotection conferred by E2 may be a
result of increased vasodilation.
While there is ample evidence supporting NO signal￾ing through ER activation, the mechanisms by which E2
exerts its powerful vasoactive effects are not straightfor￾ward. White et al. found that E2 relaxed porcine coron￾ary arteries in an endothelium-independent and dose￾dependent fashion; however, when arteries were pre￾treated with agents to uncouple NO production from
eNOS, E2 elicited dose-dependent contractions of arter￾ies [73]. After E2-induced coronary contraction had
reached its maximum levels, an inhibitor of superoxide
(O2
−
, tempol) was able to reverse this response by redu￾cing O2
−
. Thus, the authors proposed that acute E2 ad￾ministration produces both coronary vasodilation and
vasoconstriction via NO and O2
−
, respectively [73].
In an attempt to investigate the role of ERα and ERβ
in NO stimulation and cardioprotection, several groups
studied the effect of OVX, E2, and selective ER agonists
on vasodilation and hypertension in spontaneously
hypertensive rats. Treatment of spontaneously hyperten￾sive OVX female rats with E2 or a selective ERα agonists
resulted in improved endothelial function, reduced car￾diac hypertrophy, and improved cardiac outcomes when
compared to OVX rats without treatment [74, 75].
While Widder et al. found that treatment with E2 or se￾lective ERα agonist resulted in increased eNOS expres￾sion in the aorta, there was no statistically significant
attenuation of hypertension when compared to OVX
rats in this study or in a later study by Pelzer et al. [74,
75]. A follow-up study by Jazbutyte et al. revealed that
administration of a selective ERβ agonist to spontan￾eously hypertensive OVX female rats attenuated hyper￾trophy, lowered peripheral artery resistance, and
decreased systolic blood pressure [76]. Taken together,
these studies indicate that E2 improves cardiovascular
function in spontaneously hypertensive female rats via
both classical ERs, although ERβ elicits a stronger anti￾hypertensive effect. In the AngII-induced cardiac hyper￾tension model, however, Xue et al. found that AngII￾induced hypertension was greater in OVX and ERα KO
female mice than in intact WT female mice suggesting
that E2 acts mainly through ERα to reduce AngII￾induced hypertension [77].
In the context of I/R injury, Gabel et al. also concluded
that ERβ confers cardioprotection in females by modu￾lating the expression of eNOS and other genes involved
in fatty acid metabolism [78]. In this study, gonadally in￾tact males treated with isoproterenol immediately prior
to ex vivo ischemia exhibited significantly lower func￾tional recovery following reperfusion than intact females.
Transgenic female ERα-KO mice exhibited similar func￾tional recovery to WT females, while female ERβ-KO
mice exhibited diminished functional recovery similar to
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 7 of 16

that of WT males. Notably, cardiac eNOS protein ex￾pression was found to be significantly lower in the ERβ￾KO mice when compared to female WT and ERα-KO
mice, indicating that the ERβ-mediated expression of
eNOS may be responsible for sex differences in func￾tional recovery following I/R injury [78]. In a separate
study, female ERβ-KO mice were also found to exhibit
abnormal vascular function, hypertension, increased
mortality, and aggravated heart failure following MI
when compared to female WT controls [79]. Interest￾ingly, Pelzer et al. did not find significant differences in
LV eNOS expression between groups [79].
Similarly, Nikolic et al. found that 2-week pretreat￾ment with DPN, an ERβ agonist, is cardioprotective in I/
R injury in OVX female mice [79]. Gene profiling in this
experimental model revealed that treatment with DPN is
associated with a significant increase in cardioprotective
genes, including those encoding NO biosynthesis and
anti-apoptotic proteins [80]. Lin et al. showed that
chronic E2 or DPN treatment also leads to activation of
protein S-nitrosylation and cardioprotection, which was
blocked by eNOS inhibition [81]. Taken together, these
data indicate that chronic E2 exposure protects the heart
largely via ERβ activation and subsequent NO signaling.
Studies suggest that classical ERs are not solely respon￾sible for E2-induced vasodilation and that GPR30 activa￾tion can also impact vascular tone. Lindsey et al. found
that activation of GPR30 via G-1 induced similar vasodila￾tory effects as E2 in isolated aortic rings from both intact
and OVX female rats [82]. Pretreatment with GPR30 an￾tagonist, G15, successfully blocked G-1- and E2-induced
vasodilation. Similarly, removal of the endothelium or pre￾treatment with l-NAME, a constitutive eNOS inhibitor,
partially attenuated vasorelaxation. These data suggest
that GPR30 activation by E2 or selective agonist induces
vasorelaxation in female rodent aortas through a partially
endothelium and eNOS-dependent mechanism [82].
More recently, Fredette et al. elucidated the mechan￾ism by which E2 and G-1 induce vasodilation in male
human endothelial cells and GPR30-KO mice [83]. The
study demonstrated that GPR30 stimulates endothelial
NO production via activation of the c-Src/EGFR/PI3K/
ERK1/2 signaling pathway. E2 and G-1 treatment in￾duced NO release in cultured endothelial cells and ex￾tracted aortic rings from WT mice. In GPR30-KO mice,
the vasodilatory effect of G-1 was completely abrogated
while the effect of E2 was reduced by 50% [83].
The significant involvement of GPR30 in eliciting a
vasodilatory response may contribute to some of the sex
differences in CVD. A study by Lenhart et al. reported
that female mice have more membrane-localized GPR30
when compared to male mice [84]. Furthermore, they
found that GPR30 directly interacts with receptor active
modifying protein 3 (RAMP3), a protein known to affect
the trafficking and activity of several GPCRs. After sub￾jecting male and female WT and Ramp3-KO mice to
GPR30 activation via G-1, the authors found the cardio￾protection conferred by G-1 to be both Ramp3 and sex
specific [84].
Sudhir et al. found that E2 induced a significant in￾crease in coronary cross-sectional area, flow velocity,
and volumetric blood flow in male and female canine
coronary arteries that was not attenuated by pretreat￾ment with l-NAME or the classic ER antagonist, ICI
182,780 [85]. The investigators thus conclude that acute
E2-induced dilation of coronary arteries is endothelium￾independent and is not mediated via the classic intracel￾lular E2 receptors, but presumably via non-genomic
mechanisms involving GPRs at the plasma membrane
[85].
In addition to stimulating eNOS production, E2 has
also been shown to enhance vasodilation through inhib￾ition of the angiotensin pathway. Isolated RNA from dif￾ferent tissues (kidney cortex, kidney medulla, lung, and
aorta) of OVX female rats treated with E2 for 21 days
revealed a downregulation of angiotensin-converting en￾zyme (ACE) transcript levels [86]. Thus, downregulation
of ACE with a consequent reduction in the circulating
levels of the vasoconstrictor AngII could be another
mechanism by which E2 confers its beneficial cardiovas￾cular effects.
In summary, studies suggest that E2 plays a very dy￾namic role in modulating vasorelaxation, vasoconstric￾tion, and endothelial function via largely eNOS￾dependent mechanisms (Fig. 2). This mechanism may
contribute to the cardioprotective effect of E2 as E2 re￾duced hypertrophy and increased cardiac function in the
spontaneous hypertensive rat model and in models of I/
R injury. Further studies using animal models of hyper￾tension found that stimulation of classical ERs may also
attenuate hypertension. Stimulation of GPR30 by E2 or
GPR30-specific agonists also stimulated eNOS and NO
production in a sex-specific manner. By reducing the ex￾pression of ACE, E2 treatment also results in lower
levels of AngII and reduced vasoconstriction.
Aromatase and the cardiovascular system
While the main site of E2 production is the female
ovary, peripheral tissues can also act as sites of local E2
production by converting androgens into E2 via the aro￾matase enzyme [87]. Aromatase is widely distributed in
gonadal and extragonadal tissues including the bone,
brain, adipose tissue, and blood vessels [88]. Local pro￾duction of E2 in these tissues by aromatase plays an im￾portant role in the physiological functions of these
tissues [89]. For example, the presence of aromatase in
the coronary endothelium suggests that the local cardiac
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 8 of 16

conversion of androgens to E2 likely affects cardiac
function and structural modeling [90].
Aromatase is encoded by the CYP19 gene, and genetic
variations in the CYP19 gene result in alterations of cir￾culating levels of sex hormones [91–93]. Ma et al. sug￾gests that genetic variations in CYP19 might contribute
to variations in the pathophysiology of E2-dependent
diseases [94]. Wang et al. identified a single nucleotide
polymorphism in the CYP19 gene to be associated with
a decreased risk of coronary heart disease among a
Chinese population in which both sexes were equally
represented [95].
Aromatase activity has been confirmed in female rat
arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and in bovine cor￾onary endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro [96, 97]. Harada et
al. further demonstrated aromatase activity in human
male and female arterial SMCs, but not in female ECs,
which could potentially indicate autocrine/paracrine E2
activity [89]. It is speculated that E2 produced in vascu￾lar SMCs acts to promote cardiac contractility, vasodila￾tion, and collagen synthesis, while also stimulating EC
functions such as NO production and angiogenesis [89].
Within vasculature, E2 protects against atherosclerotic
progression in experimental animal models of athero￾sclerosis in both males and females, and aromatase has
been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting this vas￾cular protection [98–100]. The ablation of aromatase
has also been demonstrated to be associated with in￾creased adiposity [101] and progressive insulin resistance
[102], which are significant factors in the development
of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and
diabetic cardiomyopathy.
While E2 is largely considered to be protective in both
male and female rodents in the context of I/R injury and
HF, the role of aromatase in conferring cardioprotection
is unclear. Bell et al. investigated the role of aromatase
deficiency in I/R injury using aromatase knockout
(ArKO) female mice and found that the recovery of left
ventricular developed pressure as well calcium handling
was substantially improved in ArKO versus wild-type
(WT) mouse hearts [103]. Later on, the same group
demonstrated that isolated cardiomyocytes from ArKO
female mice exhibited greater basal calcium transient
amplitude and shortening than in WT [104]. Isolated
cardiomyocytes from ArKO female mice exposed to a
high-calcium load also showed increased calcium transi￾ent and contractile amplitudes. The study concluded
that the relative withdrawal of E2 in favor of testosterone
may be positive inotropic via optimized calcium hand￾ling in response to stress and aromatase inhibition which
could lead to cardioprotection [104]. Bell et al. also stud￾ied whether upregulation of tissue aromatase expression
could improve ischemic resilience in male hearts by sub￾jecting male mice in which aromatase was transgenically
upregulated (AROM+) to I/R injury [105]. As expected,
male AROM+ mice exhibited markedly lower testoster￾one and higher E2 levels when compared to wild-type
male mice. AROM+ male hearts had better functional
recovery post ischemia, whereas female AROM+ hearts
did not exhibit the same improvement in post-ischemic
function [105]. Thus, these findings demonstrate that
aromatase modulates cardiac function in a sex-specific
manner [105].
A recent study by our group found that cardiac aro￾matase transcript levels are reduced in male mice in the
TAC-induced model of LV HF [40]. Interestingly, these
mice also exhibited decreased local cardiac E2 levels, but
not circulating plasma E2. E2 therapy for 10 days after
the onset of HF restored aromatase transcript levels in
the heart similar to control levels and upregulated local
cardiac E2 concentrations. We stipulated that the
normalization of cardiac aromatase by E2 could either
be attributed to improvement in cardiac function or in￾creased E2 bioavailability in the heart [40]. As the aro￾matase gene has several half E2 response elements as
well as Sp1 and Ap1 elements, it is possible that in￾creased heart E2 concentrations reported in the study
post-E2 therapy could have stimulated the transcription
of aromatase.
Recent studies have also implicated the role of aroma￾tase in regulating RV function in the Sugen hypoxia rat
model, an experimental model of PH that is associated
with an elevated RV systolic pressure and RV hypertrophy.
Aromatase inhibition using anastrozole (an aromatase in￾hibitor) reversed adverse RV remodeling in female Sugen
hypoxia rats [106]. Studies have also shown that metfor￾min (a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes by controlling
blood glucose levels) reversed elevated RV systolic pres￾sure and hypertrophy in Sugen hypoxia female rats, inde￾pendent of glycemia, without any effects on systemic
blood pressure, cardiac output, or heart rate [107]. Inter￾estingly, metformin was shown to inhibit aromatase with￾out any adverse effects on the RV [108]. Taken together,
these studies suggest that aromatase inhibition may re￾verse PH and that metformin could be used to treat PH
by inhibiting aromatase activity.
It is well-known that the incidence of cardiovascular
events is significantly lower in women when compared
to age-matched men even following menopause [109]. In
postmenopausal women, peripheral aromatase activity
becomes the primary source of E2 synthesis, and studies
indicate that aromatase activity may also increase with
age. Plasma concentrations of cytokines known to stimu￾late aromatase activity were shown to increase over time
in males and females [87]. Differences in aromatase ac￾tivity between males and females may contribute to sex
biases even after menopause. Aromatase inhibitors,
which are used clinically for treatment of breast cancer,
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 9 of 16

have been shown to carry the potential risk of increased
cardiovascular events. One clinical study found that
treatment with aromatase inhibitors is associated with a
higher risk of ischemic heart disease versus tamoxifen, a
broad ER antagonist [110]. Another population-based
observational study of a heterogeneous population of 74
women with early breast cancer who received adjuvant
hormonal therapy and subsequently underwent cardiac
angiography concluded that aromatase inhibitors signifi￾cantly increased the hazard for CAD compared to tam￾oxifen [111]. These studies, however, are in direct
conflict with recent genome-wide association studies
that attribute this finding to the cardioprotective effects
of tamoxifen versus the detrimental effects of aromatase
inhibitors [112].
Interestingly, the concurrent use of aromatase inhibi￾tors and adjuvant radiotherapy for early-stage left-sided
breast cancer, in the absence of tamoxifen treatment,
yielded a significant decrease in RV systolic function and
LV diastolic function when compared to radiotherapy
alone [113]. While more long-term studies are necessary,
these findings indicate that aromatase inhibition may
lead to reduced cardioprotection in females.
Aromatase inhibition may increase the risk of CVD in
men as well. A recent intervention pilot study by De
Smet et al. investigated the effect of aromatase inhibition
on the cardiovascular system on young healthy men 20–
40 years old [114]. The study employed 20 participants
who were randomized to the aromatase inhibitor group
(letrozole, 2.5 mg daily for 7 days) or letrozole plus an
E2 patch (75 μg/day for 7 days). The letrozole plus E2
group, which yielded a similar sex steroid profile to that
observed in obese men, demonstrated a statistically sig￾nificant decrease in circumferential strain indicating sub￾clinically impaired function of the LV subendocardial
layers [114].
In summary, the aromatase enzyme converts andro￾gens to E2 in many extragonadal tissues. While the bulk
of experiments suggest that E2 is cardioprotective, the
effect of increased aromatase activity remains controver￾sial. In vasculature, aromatase activity seems to protect
against the development of atherosclerosis, and aroma￾tase null mice exhibit increased adiposity and insulin re￾sistance which are risk factors in the development of
CVD. Conversely, aromatase null mice also exhibit in￾creased calcium handling and better functional recovery
when subjected to I/R injury. In direct contradiction to
this finding, aromatase overexpression resulted in better
functional recovery following I/R in male mice but not
in female mice. Interestingly, aromatase expression is
downregulated in HF, yet inhibition of aromatase activity
helps to reverse RV HF and hypertrophy in rodents. In
humans, the use of aromatase inhibitor in women and
men may increase the risk of developing CVD or CVD
risk factors. These findings, while contradictory, demon￾strate that aromatase may play a role in mediating cardi￾oprotection; however, more research is needed to
investigate the nature of aromatase role.
Controversies regarding the use of estrogen for
therapeutic purposes
While the use of E2 therapy in CVD has shown predom￾inantly beneficial effects in animal models, the use of E2
in humans in the form of hormone replacement therapy
has been very controversial. The following are the main
controversial aspects of hormonal therapy in humans.
Efficacy of hormone replacement therapy
Two large-scale randomized, double-blind, placebo￾controlled clinical trials, the Women’s Health Initiative
(WHI) and Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement
Study (HERS), were designed to examine the efficacy of
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in reducing the
risk of ischemic heart disease in postmenopausal women
[115]. In WHI trails, postmenopausal women (50–
79 years old) without a history of CVD were adminis￾tered a daily dose of conjugated equine E2 (CEE,
0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA,
2.5 mg). Unfortunately, the WHI trail was discontinued
prematurely due to adverse cardiac events and increased
risk of breast cancer [116]. The HERS trial, conducted in
postmenopausal women with pre-existing CVD (44–
79 years old), found that daily use of CEE (0.625 mg)
plus MPA (2.5 mg) had no effect on primary or second￾ary cardiovascular outcomes [117, 118].
The failure of both trials to support the protective role
of HRT in reducing CVD could, in part, be due to the
HRT being administered long after the onset of meno￾pause in most of the women enrolled. A new hypothesis
deemed the “Critical Window of Hormone Therapy” has
recently received a lot of attention. The hypothesis sup￾ports the view that HRT could be effective if started
early at the onset of menopause [119]. A more recent
randomized study that administered HRT to women
(42–58 years old) within 6–36 months following the on￾set of menopause supports the “Critical Window” hy￾pothesis as certain risk factors for CVD were reduced
[120]. Another randomized study in women (45–58 years
old) also showed a significantly reduced risk of mortality,
heart failure, or myocardial infarction if HRT was initi￾ated early after menopause [121].
Another potential reason for the failure of the WHI
and HERS trials could be that the hormone dosage and
the combination of E2 and progestin employed in WHI
and HERS may not have been optimal for preventing or
reducing CVD risk. CEE administered alone at a lower
dose (0.3 mg/day) was shown to decrease major coron￾ary events in women [122] and coronary artery
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 10 of 16

atherosclerosis in adult female monkeys [123]. Proges￾tins, however, have been shown to downregulate ERs
and stimulate direct progestin receptor-mediated effects
that oppose estrogenic action [116]. MPA, a progestin
administered in conjunction with E2 in the WHI and
HERS trial, may also negate any cardioprotective effects
of E2 therapy. A randomized placebo-controlled cross￾over study showed, however, that oral administration of
E2 for 3 months without progestin does not improve
coronary flow reserve in postmenopausal women [124].
Currently, the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study
(KEEPS) is an ongoing trial testing the effect of HRT in ath￾erosclerosis and coronary calcification in women within
3 years of menopause. KEEPS will study the effect of HRT
with or without progestin as well as test different modes of
E2 administration (CEE or transdermal E2) [125].
Finally, disparity between the efficacy of HRT in ani￾mal studies and the WHI and HERS clinical trials could
be due to the downregulation of ERs in aged women. Li
et al. found that the expression of ERβ and GPR30, but
not ERα, are significantly decreased in the arteries of fe￾male rats [126]. Since most effects of estrogen are medi￾ated through its receptors, downregulation of ERs could
silence the beneficial effects of E2. Further studies are
needed to examine the expression of ERs in aged women
and identify if the efficacy of HRT changes with age.
In summary, despite numerous animal studies demon￾strating the beneficial cardioprotective effects of E2, the
WHI and HERS clinical trials both failed to support the
effectiveness of HRT in reducing CVD. However, this
may be attributed to several factors including the initi￾ation of HRT long after the start of menopause, the
dose, and combination of E2 and progestin. The ongoing
large randomized KEEPS trial, which administers E2
with and without progestin early after the onset of
menopause, has the potential to shed valuable light on
the efficacy of HRT in reducing CVD in early postmeno￾pausal women.
Arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and estrogen
Sex differences exist in the underlying electrophysiology
of the heart that may influence the risk of developing
arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. It is likely that
these differences are modulated by sex hormones and
that sex hormones also affect the presentation of these
arrhythmias and the response to antiarrhythmic drugs
and therapies [127]. In fact, women have a higher risk of
acquired long QT syndrome from antiarrhythmic drugs
than men. Thus, understanding the effects of hormones
in mediating arrhythmic risk and response to treatment
is important in order to provide effective and individual￾ized treatment for patients.
In experimental models of CVD, the role of E2 in re￾ducing ventricular arrhythmias has been controversial.
In support of antiarrhythmic effects of E2, Philp et al. ex￾amined the effect of E2 on ischemia-induced cardiac ar￾rhythmias and found that administration of E2 before
coronary artery ligation exhibited antiarrhythmic activity
in a dose-dependent manner in female rats [128]. Inter￾estingly, the antiarrhythmic activity of E2 in the myocar￾dial ischemia setting was greater in female rats than in
male rats [128], which could be due to the effects of E2
on the expression and function of ion channels that con￾trol cardiac cell excitation and repolarization [129].
Sykes et al. showed that inhibition of E2 synthesis with
an aromatase inhibitor triggered cardiac arrhythmias in
the developing zebrafish [130]. While these data suggest
that E2 is antiarrhythmic, several studies demonstrate
that E2 actually promotes ventricular arrhythmias. For
example, female rats treated with E2 and subjected to ex
vivo ischemia experienced an increase in sustained ven￾tricular arrhythmia upon reperfusion [131]. The pro￾arrhythmic action of E2 was due to alterations of cal￾cium handling in cardiomyocytes mediated through ERβ
signaling [131]. Interestingly, while E2 increased the in￾cidence and duration of ventricular arrhythmia, the in￾farct size post-I/R was significantly reduced which
highlights the cardioprotective role of E2 in I/R injury
[131]. In an in vivo model of drug-induced arrhythmia,
E2 was also found to trigger ventricular arrhythmias in
both male and female rabbits [132]. Odening et al.
showed that E2 also increases ventricular arrhythmias
and sudden cardiac death in OVX transgenic long QT
rabbits [133].
In the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (catch￾ment population approximately one million), Narayanan
et al. compared cases of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) with
matched controls. A multivariate analysis on testosterone
and E2 levels measured from blood samples drawn at the
time of the SCA event revealed that higher testosterone
levels only in men were associated with lower SCA events.
On the other hand, higher estradiol levels in both women
and men were associated with higher SCA events [134].
In summary, in the experimental settings of CVD, the
role of E2 in ventricular arrhythmias is controversial as
E2 was found to be both pro- and antiarrhythmic in fe￾males or both sexes depending on the study. In humans,
increased plasma E2 levels are found to be associated
with higher SCA events in both men and women. Since
females are more prone to drug-induced arrhythmia
than males [135], further studies are needed to examine
whether the female heart has a unique sensitivity to E2
in the presence of certain drugs.
Estrogen and thrombosis risks
The use of E2 as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular
protection is controversial as the use of oral contracep￾tives containing E2 has been linked to an increased risk
Iorga et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2017) 8:33 Page 11 of 16

of venous thrombosis which can lead to MI, stroke, and
peripheral artery disease. While the intent of the WHI
clinical trials was to investigate the role of E2 in post￾menopausal women, the investigators did find that the
estrogen component of HRT was also associated with in￾creased risk of venous thrombosis. Canonico et al. re￾ported a similar finding [136]. These studies suggest that
E2 may have prothrombotic ability, and while controver￾sial and not fully understood, E2 may achieve this by in￾creasing procoagulant factors (factors VII, X, XII, and
XIII) and decreasing anticoagulant factors (protein S and
antithrombin) [137]. Thus, E2 supplementation via oral
contraceptives or HRT enhances the risk of venous
thrombosis especially in women with pre-existing coagu￾lation abnormalities. Progestin also contributes to this
risk as oral contraceptives or HRT containing third￾generation progestogens (desogestrel or gestodene) are
associated with a higher risk of venous thrombosis than
those containing second-generation progestogens (such
as levonorgestrel) [138].
A study by Nayak et al. found that tamoxifen, a well￾established cancer drug that reduces the effects of E2,
has an antithrombotic effect in mice and human blood
samples. In this study, tamoxifen significantly inhibited
platelet functions in human plasma while it prolonged
tail bleeding time and prevented thrombus formation at
injured arterial walls in mice [139]. This study further
demonstrates that ER modulation impacts coagulation.
While most evidence suggests that E2 has procoagula￾tory and prothrombolytic effects, a clinical trial assessing
HRT on cardiovascular events in recently postmeno￾pausal women over 10 years did not reveal an increased
risk of thrombolytic events. Women receiving HRT early
after menopause had a significantly reduced risk of
CVD, without any apparent increase in risk of cancer,
venous thromboembolism, or stroke [121].
In summary, E2 treatment in the form of oral contra￾ceptives and HRT have been linked to increased risk of
venous thrombosis, possibly due to E2's modulatory role
on procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. Research
demonstrating that tamoxifen exhibits antithrombotic
effects further suggests that ER modulation is involved
in coagulation. A long-term clinical trial studying HRT
in recently menopausal women, however, was not associ￾ated with increased risk of thrombolytic events.
Conclusions
The protection against cardiovascular disease in women
during reproductive age is believed to be related at least
in part to E2 since endogenous levels of E2 and the ex￾pression of ERs differ considerably between sexes. E2
mediates its cardioprotective actions by increasing
angiogenesis and vasodilation and decreasing ROS, oxi￾dative stress, and fibrosis. Through these mechanisms,
E2 limits cardiac remodeling and attenuates heart hyper￾trophy (Fig. 2). Although the use of E2 as a therapeutic
agent in humans has remained controversial, targeting
specific ERs in the cardiovascular system may result in
novel and possibly safer therapeutic options for the use
of E2 for cardiovascular protection.
