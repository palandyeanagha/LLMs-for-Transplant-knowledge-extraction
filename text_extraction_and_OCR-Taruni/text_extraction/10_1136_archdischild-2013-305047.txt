ABSTRACT
Background Noonan syndrome (NS), a relatively
common autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence
of 1 in 1000 to 2500 live births, is the most common
syndromic cause of congenital heart disease after
Trisomy 21.
Objective To comprehensively define the spectrum of
cardiac morphology and specific clinical course of a large
cohort of NS patients.
Design Retrospective, descriptive case series study.
Patients An international Harvard-based NS registry
was combined with clinical data from NS patients
followed at Boston Children’s Hospital, Massachusetts,
USA.
Results We identified 293 patients with NS.
Cardiovascular disease was seen in 81% (n=237)
including pulmonary stenosis in 57%, secundum atrial
septal defects in 32% and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
in 16%. A genetic mutation of the RAS-MAPK signalling
pathway was identified in 62% (n=136). Genotype￾phenotype associations were noted between PTPN11
mutations and atrial septal defects (p=0.001), and
pulmonary stenosis (p<0.001). RAF1 mutations were
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p<0.001).
Cardiovascular outcomes that differed specifically in a NS
cohort included high re-intervention rates (65%) after
percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for valvar
pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, in NS patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a clinically significant
regression of hypertrophy (17%) was observed as was a
markedly higher incidence of concomitant congenital
heart defects (70%).
Conclusions Patients with NS have a distinct spectrum
of cardiac phenotypes that may have a natural history
and response to therapy atypical to that normally seen in
non-syndromic heart disease. A diagnosis of NS in a
patient with pulmonary stenosis or infant-onset
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would facilitate condition￾specific counselling on outcome and prognosis.
INTRODUCTION
Noonan syndrome (NS) (OMIM 163950), first
described in 1963, is a relatively common auto￾somal dominant disorder characterised by distinct￾ive facial features including hypertelorism, ptosis
and low-set ears; short stature; developmental
delay of variable degree; lymphatic vessel dysplasia
and cardiac defects (see figure 1).1–3 It is a genetic￾ally heterogeneous condition with an estimated
incidence of 1 in 1000 to 1 in 2500 live births and
is the most common syndromic cause of congenital
heart disease (CHD) after Trisomy 21.4 5
Gain-of-function mutations in the RAS-MAPK sig￾nalling pathway are found in up to 60% of patients
with NS with resultant perturbations in
developmental processes including morphological
determination, organogenesis and growth.6 7
The incidence of heart disease in NS patients is
reported to be as high as 82–90%.5 8–12 Patients
with NS have been noted to have a suboptimal
outcome to percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvu￾loplasty (PBPV) for valvar pulmonary stenosis
(PS).13 Additionally, NS patients with a diagnosis of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been
historically noted to have a significantly worse sur￾vival over non-syndromic HCM for reasons that
are not well understood.12 14 15 The aims of our
study were to describe the spectrum, management
and prognosis of heart disease in NS and to investi￾gate the cohort for genotype-phenotype
correlations.
METHODS

What is already known
▸ Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant
disorder with variable expression, is the most
common syndromic cause of congenital heart
disease after Trisomy 21.
▸ Valvar pulmonary stenosis, often with
dysplastic valve leaflets, is the most common
congenital heart malformation reported with an
incidence of 50–60%.
▸ Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20% of
patients with Noonan syndrome, has a worse
risk profile at presentation compared to
idiopathic or familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
What this study adds
▸ Noonan syndrome patients undergoing
percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty
have a high re-intervention rate (65%) for
residual valvar pulmonary stenosis.
▸ Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Noonan
syndrome is associated with a markedly higher
incidence of concomitant congenital heart
disease in 70%.
▸ In the infant-onset cohort, spontaneous
regression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was
observed in 17% of affected Noonan syndrome
patients.

combined with the medical records of all clinically diagnosed
NS patients at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) before 2010.
Ethical board approval was sought and provided by the BCH
Institutional Review Board. Inclusion criteria required that a
patient had a clinical diagnosis of NS and had at least one evalu￾ation by a cardiologist including an echocardiogram or cardiac
catheterisation delineating cardiac anatomy. Patients with a con￾comitant genetic diagnosis in addition to NS were excluded
from the study. The data were retrospectively reviewed for
descriptors of cardiac morphology, clinical course and for
pathogenic mutations in the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway.
Genetic analysis
Patients who underwent genetic screening had DNA amplifica￾tion and sequencing (multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli￾fication or equivalent) from peripheral lymphocytes in one or
more of the eight described genes, namely PTPN11, SOS1,
RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, SHOC2, NRAS and CBL.
2 Deletions or
duplications of one or more exons of these genes were not
screened for in this analysis.
Data analysis
For patients who underwent balloon dilation of the pulmonary
valve, baseline characteristics were compared for those who
required subsequent surgical or catheter intervention versus
those who did not, using Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables and either the unpaired t test or Wilcoxon rank sum
test for continuous variables. Patients who underwent genetic
mutation analysis for PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, SHOC2 or KRAS
were compared by cardiac phenotype for presence or absence of
any mutation within the described gene using Fisher’s exact test.
A predetermined p value of 0.05 was set as the threshold of stat￾istical significance. Kaplan-Meier survival probability estimates
were generated for those patients with HCM.
RESULTS
We identified 293 patients with NS that met inclusion criteria:
133 patients from the Harvard-based phenotype registry, 114
patients from the records of BCH and an additional 46 patients
present in both databases that were included only once. Genetic
screening for a NS mutation had been performed in all Harvard
registry patients and 50% of patients followed at BCH. The
median age of the combined cohort at last follow-up was
14 years; 60% were male. There was no significant difference in
the age of those followed at BCH compared to the Harvard
registry but a higher prevalence of CHD was noted at BCH
(85% and 77%, respectively; p=0.04). Three quarters of the
combined cohort were born in the last 25 years (figure 2).
Cardiac lesions
Heart disease was identified in 81% of all patients (see figure 3).
It was observed that a high proportion of those NS patients

identified with any cardiac defect frequently had more than one
isolated cardiac lesion. For example, in those NS patients with
valvar PS (n=166), it was observed to be an isolated cardiac
finding in 24% (n=40). The majority (76%, n=126) of NS
patients with PS, however, had additional concomitant cardiac
lesion(s), commonly including secundum atrial septal defects
(ASDs) (n=76), HCM (n=26) or both (n=15) (see figure 4).
Valvar pulmonary stenosis
The most common congenital cardiac lesion was valvar PS
(n=166, 57% of all patients). Management of valvar PS is sum￾marised in figure 5. Surgery or PBPV was performed in 47%
(n=78) of all patients with valvar PS. Of those undergoing
PBPV (n=43), the median age at intervention was 6.4 months.
The average initial peak pulmonary valve gradient was
65 mm Hg prior to PBPV with an average residual valvar PS
gradient of 40 mm Hg. When specifically described, pulmonary
valve morphology was noted as dysplastic in 86% of those
patients undergoing PBPV. Of those patients who underwent
PBPV as their first intervention, 65% (n=28) required further
intervention (either repeat PBPV or surgery) for clinically
significant residual valvar PS. The only statistically significant
risk factor for re-intervention in those with valvar PS was
younger median age at the time of initial PBPV (0.54 vs
0.98 years, p=0.046).
Primary surgical repair for valvar PS was performed in 35
patients with either a pulmonary valvotomy (n=28) or transan￾nular patch (n=7), at an average age of 6.5 years. As a group,
patients who had valvar PS managed with primary surgical
repair reflected a cohort 17 years prior to that undergoing
primary PBPV, likely an era effect in management strategy. To
date, 4% of all patients (n=7) with PS have required pulmonary
valve replacement at a median age of 30 years.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
There were 47 NS patients diagnosed with HCM with an
average age of 16.7 years (range 0.9–59.7 years) by close of
study. A diagnosis of HCM was made in the first year of life in
57% (n=27). The degree of wall thickness was described as
‘severe’ echocardiographically in 38% (n=18) with complicating
subaortic obstruction noted in 15% (n=7). Concomitant cardiac
lesions were found in 70% (n=33) of all patients with a

diagnosis of HCM (see table 1). A RAS-MAPK signalling
pathway mutation was identified in 44% (n=21) of patients
(table 1).
Of all patients with HCM, a subset (17%; n=8) diagnosed in
infancy had regression of ventricular wall thickness over time
on serial echocardiography with normalisation of ventricular
wall dimensions over an average of 3 years (range 1–8 years)
and no recurrence noted at an average of 7-year follow-up.
Spontaneous regression of HCM was seen in patients with
mutations in PTPN11 (n=3), RAF1 (n=1), SOS1 (n=1) and
BRAF (n=1).
Interventions for symptomatic HCM (defined as congestive
heart failure or exercise-induced systemic hypotension) included
extensive myectomy (n=4) and alcohol septal ablation of the
first septal perforator (n=1).
Documented arrhythmias complicating HCM included supra￾ventricular tachycardia in five patients. Causes of death were
known for six of the seven HCM patients who died. Refractory
heart failure was the primary aetiology contributing to death in
five patients with a further sixth patient dying from complica￾tions related to prematurity. Of the seven patients with HCM
who died, four were diagnosed with HCM in the first year of
life, giving this cohort under 1 year of age (n=27) an overall
15% mortality. See figure 6 for a Kaplan–Meier estimation of
survival with a diagnosis of HCM.
RAS-MAPK signalling pathway mutations
A RAS-MAPK signalling pathway mutation was screened for in
75% (n=219) of patients with identification of a pathogenic
gene mutation in 62% (n=136) (see table 2). Among all NS
patients screened, mutations in the gene PTPN11 were most fre￾quently reported (41%, n=89). The subgroup of NS patients
harbouring a PTPN11 mutation were at significantly higher risk
of carrying a clinical diagnosis of either valvar PS (p<0.001) or
secundum ASD (p=0.001). SOS1 mutations were identified in
11% (n=25). RAF1 mutations were identified in 3% (n=7) with
HCM seen in six patients, making this a significant association
(p<0.001). The remaining RAS-MAPK signalling pathway
pathogenic mutations identified included BRAF (n=8; 4%),
SHOC2 (n=3; 1%) and KRAS (n=3; 1%).
Lymphedema
We investigated the incidence of postoperative pericardial and
pleural effusions in the cohort of NS patients who underwent
surgical repair of either valvar PS or an ASD at BCH (n=119
operations). Pericardial effusions occurred postoperatively in
5.9% (n=7). In the same cohort, 5% of NS patients (n=6)
developed clinically significant postoperative pleural effusions
with one patient developing a pleural and pericardial effusion
simultaneously.
DISCUSSION
This clearly defined NS cohort provides comprehensive insight
into the spectrum of heart disease, cardiac management and
prognosis in a large number of patients over a broad range of
ages. The cardiac lesions identified are similar in prevalence to
that described by others.5 10 16 17 Aortic root dilation, seen in a
small minority in our cohort (5%), has been previously reported
in isolated cases of NS.18–22 No patient in our cohort with
aortic root dilation had vessel dissection or required surgical
intervention. Atrioventricular canal defects were described in
2.1% patients. This is a smaller percentage than the 5%
reported by others, although absolute numbers of patients in
any cohort remain small.5 23 With regard to the theoretical
potential for a higher incidence of lymphatic complications in
patients with NS after cardiac surgery, postoperative rates of

pericardial or pleural effusion in NS are no higher than those
reported for the same cardiac lesions (valvar PS or ASD) in
non-NS patients.24–26
We focused on the management of valvar PS given this was
the predominant cardiac lesion in patients with NS and
accounted for a significant proportion of the associated cardiac
morbidity. McCrindle et al13 have previously described an asso￾ciation between poorer long-term relief from valvar PS after
PBPV in patients with NS. Although this did not bear out in
subsequent logistic regression analysis, the associated dysplastic
morphology of the pulmonary valve leaflets in NS patients was
thought to be the root cause of a suboptimal response. The inci￾dence of re-intervention after initial PBPV in our NS cohort
(65%) is in marked contrast to 5–10% quoted for
re-intervention rates after initial PBPV in unselected cohorts of
patients with valvar PS.27 28 Patients with NS are recognised to
have dysplastic pulmonary valve leaflets that may inherently be
more refractive to relief of obstruction by PBPV. Despite this
high re-intervention rate after PBPV, a significant number of
patients with NS and valvar PS (35%) continued to have a
therapeutically successful result from PBPV.
Given the theoretical concern for a potential misdiagnosis of
NS among the older patients in our database biasing our major
conclusions, we performed a subgroup analysis for those with a
confirmed RAS-MAPK signalling pathway mutation and valvar
PS (n=85). We noted a similarly high incidence of patients
requiring intervention for their PS (38%) and of those requiring
re-intervention after PBPV (46%). It is worth emphasising that,
although only 4% of our total NS cohort with valvar PS have
had valve replacement to date at a median age of 30, this may
be a relative underestimate, given the median age of our cohort
was 14 years of age.
We report distinct characteristics of HCM in a NS cohort;
notably, a high incidence of concomitant CHD (70%), early age
of presentation (57% in the first year of life) and a 15% mortal￾ity in those diagnosed with HCM in infancy. The incidence of a
concomitant congenital heart defect in non-syndromic HCM is
relatively infrequent at approximately 2.5% of all patients,
setting NS HCM distinctly apart.12 Idiopathic HCM presented
in the first year of life in 36% of cases in a large patient series.29
The observed higher rate of NS HCM presentation in infancy
(57%) may be partly due to empiric screening of patients with
NS for CHD once a diagnosis of NS has been made, thus pre￾empting symptomatic HCM in some.
Mortality in infants under a year of age in our cohort is sig￾nificantly less than that reported by others.15 Taking into
account that one of the four infant deaths in our series was as a
complication of prematurity (27 weeks gestation) only three
deaths were directly attributable to HCM (11%).
Spontaneous regression of HCM was seen in 17% of patients
(n=8). Two infant patients had severely symptomatic HCM on
echocardiography that entirely resolved. Such dramatic regres￾sion has, to the best of our knowledge, not been previously
reported in NS. Whether a maturational change in the myocar￾dial contractile state is contributing to the regression or an alter￾ation in the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway over the first year of
life is not clear at this time. Finally, two patients with PTPN11
mutations and clinically severe HCM had concomitant patho￾genic mutations identified in the sarcomeric gene MYBPC3.
They were not included in our results or data set (concomitant
genetic diagnoses being an exclusion criterion) but warrant
comment in considering other contributing genetic factors in
NS patients with severe or symptomatic HCM.
We noted a relatively low incidence of ventricular arrhythmia
(present in one patient after alcohol septal ablation) in our NS
HCM cohort compared to an incidence of 19.6% in those with
idiopathic or familial HCM.30 Our NS subjects are relatively
young with an average age of 16.7 years and longer term
follow-up is required to adequately elucidate the burden of
arrhythmias later in adulthood.
Finally, PTPN11 mutations were significantly associated with
valvar PS and secundum ASD, observations previously
reported.5 31–34 Others have also described our finding of RAF1
mutations being associated with HCM.7 35–37 Given the signifi￾cant implication of a diagnosis of NS to an individual patient, it

is prudent to consider this diagnosis in the differential for chil￾dren presenting with CHD and any other phenotype consistent
with the presentation. Careful family history and referral for
genetic counselling facilitates this investigation.
There are some important limitations of our study. We
presume a referral bias to BCH for NS patients with CHD. The
findings in our data set may not extrapolate to individuals diag￾nosed with NS secondary to cascade screening of first-degree
family relatives after identification of an index case. It is reason￾able to assume that such identified individuals may have a
milder phenotype than those who present with clinical features
diagnostic of NS or with the associated clinically relevant heart
disease. The disparate ages of the cohort must be factored into
any interpretation of management strategies and outcomes over
time. Patients who underwent genetic screening for a NS muta￾tion were not uniformly re-screened for mutations in newly
reported genes as they became clinically available.
In conclusion, we have comprehensively described the burden
of cardiovascular disease in a large, clearly defined cohort of
patients with NS. Focusing on the management of those with
valvar PS, we noted a high re-intervention rate after PBPV. In
those patients with HCM, we noted an early age of diagnosis, a
high incidence of concomitant CHD and the possibility of spon￾taneous disease regression in a minority over time. With a
deeper understanding of disease characteristics distinct to NS,
clinicians will be better able to counsel families regarding prog￾nosis and tailor therapy for optimal patient outcome.
