Abstract
The lining of the adult heart contains epicardial mesothelial cells (EMCs) that have the potential to undergo fibrogenic
Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) during cardiac injury. EMT of EMCs has therefore been suggested to contribute
to the heterogeneous fibroblast pool that mediates cardiac fibrosis. However, the molecular basis of this process is poorly
understood. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate a number of sub-cellular events in cardiac disease.
Hence, we hypothesized that miRNAs regulate fibrogenic EMT in the adult heart. Indeed pro-fibrogenic stimuli, especially
TGF-b, promoted EMT progression in EMC cultures, which resulted in differential expression of numerous miRNAs, especially
the pleiotropic miR-21. Accordingly, ectopic expression of miR-21 substantially promoted the fibroblast-like phenotype
arising from fibrogenic EMT, whereas an antagonist that targeted miR-21 blocked this effect, as assessed on the E-cadherin/
a-smooth muscle actin balance, cell viability, matrix activity, and cell motility, thus making miR-21 a relevant target of EMC￾derived fibrosis. Several mRNA targets of miR-21 was differentially regulated during fibrogenic EMT of EMCs and miR-21-
dependent targeting of Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) and Sprouty Homolog 1 (SPRY1) significantly contributed to the
development of a fibroblastoid phenotype. However, PDCD4- and SPRY1-targeting was not entirely ascribable to all
phenotypic effects from miR-21, underscoring the pleiotropic biological role of miR-21 and the increasing number of
recognized miR-21 targets.

Introduction
Cardiac fibrosis is a prominent element of cardiac disease, and
involves numerous biochemical and cellular events leading to
interrupted homeostasis of the extracellular matrix, thus ultimately
impairing heart performance. The traditional concept that cardiac
fibrosis is solely mediated by the activation and differentiation of
residing interstitial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts has recently
been challenged [1,2]. In addition to contributions from bone￾marrow-derived cells, as much as 35% of the fibroblasts in cardiac
fibrosis can originate from Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transi￾tion (EndMT) of microvascular endothelial cells, as studied in a
pressure-overload model [3]. Additionally, there is increasing
evidence, not only in vitro [4,5] but also in vivo [6,7,8], that
fibroblast-like cells in the injured adult heart can arise from
Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of the epicardial
mesothelial cells (EMCs) lining the heart. During cardiac
development, the epicardium is formed by migration of mesothe￾lial cells from the proepicardial organ, and subsequently some of
the mesothelium generates multipotent epicardium-derived cells
(EPDCs). Those EPDCs have the potential to differentiate into all
major cell populations of the heart by EMT, including endothelial
cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and even cardiomyocytes
[9–14]. In the adult heart, EMT of the epicardial mesothelium is
thought to occur by re-activation of the developmental program
[5,7]. However, in the conditions of the injured adult heart, the
EMT of EMCs predominantly generates fibroblast-like cells,
thereby contributing to the default repair-driven fibrotic response
[8,15]. Nonetheless, the adult EMCs or multipotent EPDCs seems
to withstand their inherent progenitor potential if not challenged
by the fibrogenic environment of the injured myocardium [8], and
inhibiting fibroblast-committed EMT to facilitate myogenic/
angiogenic differentiation is of increasing interest within the field
of regenerative tissue engineering.
Cardiac disease and development is substantially regulated by
microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs that
post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression [16]. Therefore,
miRNAs have been suggested as clinically relevant targets of
cardiac disease [17,18,19,20]. In specific, miR-21 and 229 have
been identified as key players in cardiac remodeling by affecting

interstitial fibroblasts [21,22,23]. Although miRNAs primarily are
believed to fine-tune biological processes, the impact of these
miRNAs exert quite substantial effects on the cellular level, and
anti-miR-21 treatment may revert in vivo cardiac fibrosis as shown
in mouse models [22]. Additionally, miRNAs have been impli￾cated as major modulators of EMT in cancer cell lines [24–28] as
well as implicated in cardiac EndMT [29], but their involvement
in cardiac EMT remains to be determined. We therefore set forth
to determine the role of miRNAs in fibrogenic EMT of adult
EMCs. We hereby show that cardiac fibrogenic EMT, and the
associated generation of fibroblast-like cells, is indeed significantly
modulated by miRNAs, especially miR-21 through direct targets

including Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) and Sprouty
homolog 1 (SPRY1). This suggests that miR-21 is a potential
therapeutic target for manipulation of EPDC fate-decision.
Methods
Ethics Statement
All experiments involving cell cultures were performed with
tissue from adult (8–10 weeks) Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic
Europe, Denmark) that were sacrificed by CO2 and cervical
dislocation. Cell culture experiments were performed in accor￾dance with 11 in the Danish proclamation of law on animal
experimentation (LBK No. 1306, 23/11/2007). Transverse aortic
constriction (TAC) and left anterior descending artery (LAD)
ligation was performed on 12-week old female C57/BL6 mice,
which were anesthetized IP with Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and
Xylazine (5 mg/kg) and ventilated by tracheal intubation and
connection to a MiniVent (Harvard Apparatus) set to a tidal
volume 0.2 ml and a frequency of 100 min21
. Animal experi￾ments were approved by the Danish National Animal Experiment

561-1966 (LAD ligation).
EMC Isolation and Culture
Dissected rat hearts were washed in a cardioplegic preparation
buffer (1.2 mmol/L KH2PO4 (pH 7.4); 2.4 mmol/L Na2CO3;
0.11 mol/L NaCl; 2.6 mmol/L KCl; 1.2 mmol/L Mg2SO4;
11 mmol/L glucose; incubated at 37uC, 5% CO2, 24 h before
use) supplemented with heparin. Isolated ventricles were cut into
three pieces, washed twice with preparation buffer/50 IE/ml
heparin, and sequentially digested (2612 min., stirring at RT) with
0.15% Trypsin (BD Difco) in preparation buffer supplemented
with 0.01% DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). Dissociated cells were
harvested by centrifugation 7 min., 3006g, 4uC. Red blood cells
were lysed (168 mmol/L NH4Cl; 10 mmol/L NaHCO3;
0.1 mmol/L Tetrasodium EDTA) prior to wash, and remaining
cells were resuspended in growth medium (Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagles Medium (DMEM; BE12-604F/U1, Lonza)/10% FBS
(Gibco; 10270-106)/1% Penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). Isolated
cells were plated in growth medium onto polystyrene dishes,
allowed to attach for 1 h, and washed twice in growth medium. At
day 10 of culture, homogeneous, non-differentiated clones
comprising 100–150 cells (Figure 1A) were isolated using cloning
cylinders (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen).
Clones derived from the same rat heart were pooled, plated at 3–5
cells/cm2 in polystyrene dishes, and cultured for additional 33
days with one intervening passage, and medium change every
fourth day. EMCs were isolated individually from 8 animals,
frozen in liquid nitrogen until use, then gently thawed, cultured
and used in passage P5–P6 for all experiments. EMT was induced
in ,20% confluent EMC cultures by incubation with 10 ng/mL
of recombinant human IL-1b, TNF-a, or TGF-b1 (all R&D
Biosystems) in DMEM/2% FBS for 48 h and then with 10 ng/mL
IL-1b, TNF-a, or TGF-b1 in DMEM/10% FBS for further 48 h.
Transverse Aortic Constriction
Under sterile conditions the chest was opened at the second
intercostal space and the thymus glands were superiorly reflected.
The transverse thoracic aortic branch was dissected and a 7–0
Prolene suture was tied around the aorta between right and left
common carotid artery against a blunted 26-gauge needle. Hearts
were obtained at day 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21 after TAC and miR-21
profiling was conducted on biological triplicates. A time-matched
control group (also n = 3) underwent a sham operation, thus
excluding TAC.
Left Anterior Descending Artery Ligation
Under sterile conditions the chest was opened at the fourth
intercostal space and the LAD dissected. Acute myocardial
infarction was induced by LAD ligation using a 7-0 prolene
suture. Hearts were obtained at day 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 after LAD
ligation, and miR-21 profiling was performed on two, four, two,
one and four pooled hearts, respectively. The time-matched
control group underwent a sham operation and miR-21 profiling
was performed on one or two pooled hearts.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and otherwise
prepared as previously described [30]. Specific for SPRY1
stainings, cells were fixed with ice cold methanol. Cells were
incubated overnight with primary antibodies (see below), which
were visualized using Alexa 488 or 555 conjugated secondary
antibodies (diluted 1:200). Non-specific staining by antibodies was
identified by mouse IgG2a, IgG1 or rabbit IgG isotype controls or,
in case of Islet1, WT1 or Nkx2.5, rat ventricular fibroblasts [30]
were used as negative controls. Nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI (Vectorshield, Vector Laboratories, UK), and images were
acquired using a Leica DMI4000B Cool Fluo Package instrument
equipped with a Leica DFC340 FX Digital Cam. In all
experiments, exposure (camera settings) and picture processing
(brief adjustment of contrast/brightness and color balance by
Photoshop (Version 10.0.1)) were applied equally to the entire
image from sample sections and controls (mouse isotypes, rabbit
IgG, and rat ventricular fibroblasts).

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry for CD31 was performed as previously
reported. The adipose derived stromal vascular fraction, rich in
endothelial cells, was isolated [30] from adult WK rats and used as
a positive control.
Transfections
EMCs were equilibrated in serum-free medium for 1 h and
subsequently transfected for 4 h with pre-miRs, anti-miRs or
siRNAs using the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Invitrogen, DK)
as recommended by the manufacturer, except that DMEM was
applied as transfection medium. Optimal transfections were
achieved at 20 nM probe (Figs. S4 and S7), and this concentration
was used for all experiments. EMCs transfected with pre-miRs
were washed and further cultured for 48 h in DMEM/2% FBS
until analysis. For single transfection with anti-miRs or in
combination with siRNAs, EMCs were pre-incubated in
DMEM/2% FBS supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant
human TGF-b1 (R&D Biosystems) to initiate EMT. After 20 h,
cultures were transfected with siRNAs and/or anti-miRs for 4 h
and subsequently incubated with 10 ng/mL recombinant human
TGF-b1 for another 24 h. Pre-miR-21 (PM10206) and pre-miR
scramble controls (with [AM17212] or without [AM17110] FAM)
were from Ambion, Denmark. The applied anti-miRs were
designed in accordance with previously validated Locked nucleic
acid-based anti-miRs [31] (Scramble, 59-+T*G*+T*A*A*+-

LNA base, *denotes phosphorothioate bond) and were purchased
from Exiqon, Denmark.
For siRNA transfections, the Silencer Select system from
Applied Biosystems was used. Optimal knock-down was achieved
by assessing three variants of each siRNA (PDCD4-siRNA
(4390771; s133733; s133734; s133735) and SPRY1-siRNA
(439071; s148913; s235122; s235123)). Efficient mRNA knock￾downs (.75%) relatively to a negative siRNA control (4390846)
were reached with s133735 (PDCD4) and s235123 (SPRY1) (Fig.
S6), and all further experiments were therefore performed with
these siRNA variants.
Cell Number and Volume
Cultured cells were gently detached by 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA
(Invitrogen, Denmark). The cell number and cell diameter were
determined using a Beckman Coulter Counter Z2 (Ramcon,
Denmark) fitted with a 100 mm aperture. The size range of
particles counted was set at 10–25 mm and counting was
performed in three independent experiments, each comprising
triplicate measurements.
MTT Assay
Viability was validated by a standard Vybrant MTT cell
proliferation assay (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), measuring the
mitochondrial activity.

hearts, respectively, and analyzed against sham treated animals by two-way ANOVA. All miRNA qRT-PCR data were normalized against miR-17 and
miR-195. **P,0.01, ***P,0.001 vs. control.

Wound Healing Assay
EMCs were cultured to ,90% confluence in a 12-wells plate
and wound healing was assessed as previously described [32]. In
brief, scratches were induced mechanically with a pipette tip. The
wells were subsequently washed twice and incubated for 21 h. The
wound widths were measured at three pre-defined spots in wells at
both 0 h and 21 h after scratch induction. The relative wound size
was computed as the relative decrease in the wound width across
time.
ELISA
TIMP-1 amounts in EMC culture supernatants were measured
by a rat TIMP-1 sandwich ELISA kit (R&D Biosystems, DY580)
as recommended by the manufacturer. The specific amount (pg/
cell) of TIMP-1 was calculated by standardizing with the cell
numbers as quantified by Coulter counting.
Western Blotting
Western blotting for PDCD4 and SPRY1 was performed using
the NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Invitrogen) as previously
described [33]. Reduced protein lysates were separated on a 4–
12% Bis-Tris gradient gel in MOPS running buffer and blotted
onto a PVDF membrane. Primary antibodies were used at a
concentration of 0.34 mg/ml for rabbit anti-PDCD4 and 2 mg/ml
for rabbit anti-SPRY1. HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immu￾noglobulins (Dako, P0217) was used as secondary antibody and
bands were visualized by chemiluminescense with an ECL kit (GE
Healthcare). Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ 1.43
software and presented relative to the total protein amount, as
estimated by Coomassie staining.
RNA Extraction
Total RNA was extracted with TriReagent (Molecular
Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), as previously described
[30]. RNA purity and stability was validated by Nanodrop (Saveen
Werner, Denmark) measurements and capillary electrophoresis on
an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer using RNA Nano Chips (Agilent
technologies, Denmark).
Relative qRT-PCR
Relative qRT-PCR was performed on 400 ng reverse-tran￾scribed cDNA (High Capacity cDNA RT kit; Applied Biosystems,
Denmark) using SYBR green (Appiled Biosystems) as reporter dye
and 10 mmol/L rat-specific primers. All primers were from DNA￾Technology A/S, Denmark (Table S1). As recommended by
others [34,35], and as previously described [30], we used the
qBase+ software to normalize all qRT-PCR data against multiple
stably expressed reference genes (mRNAs or miRNAs) as
determined by the geNorm platform (Table S2). TaqManH
microRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) were applied for expres￾sion analyses of miR-21 (Assay ID 0397) and the endogenous
controls let-7f (Assay ID 0382), miR-17-5p (Assay ID 2308), and
miR-195 (Assay ID 0494).
miRNA Microarray Analysis
miRNA expression profiling was performed as two-color
common reference hybridizations on LNA-based arrays (miR￾CURY LNATM microRNA Array ready-to-spot probe set, v.10,
208110-A, Exiqon, Denmark) spotted in-house on CodeLinkTM
HD Activated slides (DHD1-0023, SurModics, Eden Prairie, MN)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 26250 ng total RNA
was used for each hybridization. Samples were labeled with Hy3
and the common reference (pool of all samples) was labeled with
Hy5, by use of miRCURY LNA microRNA Array Power labeling
kit (208032-A, Exiqon) and hybridized for 16 hours. Slides were
washed (208021, Exiqon) and scanned on an Agilent (G2565CA)
Microarray Scanner, and scans were analyzed by GenePix 6.0
software. Normalization and background correction was per￾formed in R using ‘‘vsn’’ package from Bioconductor, and
triplicate spots were averaged. Differential expression was next
assayed using the ‘‘limma’’ package also from Bioconductor by
fitting to the eBayes linear model and contrasting individual
treatments with untreated controls. Log fold changes (FC) were
calculated using the ‘‘topTable’’ function of the limma package.
The most regulated miRNAs (22,FC.2) were presented as
log2FC in heatmap, and data were hierachially clustered for both
sample treatment (IL-1b, TNF-a or TGF-b) and miRNA using
Pearson Correlation in the software program MeV 4.5. The data
discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible
through GEO Series accession number GSE37627 (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE37627).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as means6SD from 3 independent
experiments, and statistical significance (a = 0.05) was tested by
two-tailed t-tests, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post test, or two￾way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 5.0a. Data acquired by
qRT-PCR were Log2-transformed before statistical analyses.
Results
Primary EMC Cultures can be Clonally Obtained
Isolation and cultivation of adult EMCs have largely been
performed by explant cultures [6,7,15,36]. To achieve high purity
and clone integrity of EMCs, we instead established clonogenic
cultures directly isolated from the epicardium. In this manner we
obtained homogenous clones exhibiting tight cobblestone mor￾Table 1. miR-21 promotes a mesenchymal phenotype during

phology, and this epithelioid phenotype was maintained for up to
12 passages (Fig. 1A). EMCs were positive for epicardial markers
Wilms Tumor protein homolog (WT1), E-cadherin, Tbx18,
Raldh2, and Islet-1, but negative for Nkx2.5 (Fig. 1B–C), which
both confirmed their epicardial origin and EMC progenitor
commitment [37]. The near 100% purity of EMCs was validated
by analyses for CD45, Troponin T, a-smooth muscle actin (a￾SMA) and CD31 (Fig. S1), which ruled out contamination from
leukocytes, myocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.
EMCs Undergo Fibrogenic EMT in vitro
We next asked if the adult EMCs were able to adapt a
mesenchymal fibroblast-like cell phenotype by EMT, in accor￾dance with previous reports on cardiac EMT [4,5,6,7,8]. EMT of
epithelial cells including the mesothelium, can be induced by pro￾inflammatory cytokines or growth factors, such as TGF-b [38]. To
increase experimental specificity and scientific power, we both
tested IL-1b, TNF-a, and TGF-b for their efficacy to induce EMT
in EMCs (Fig. 2). Indeed, over time, treated EMCs developed a
fibroblastoid morphology (Fig. 2A) with loss of the epicardial
marker WT1 (Fig. 2B) and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers
S100A4 and a-SMA (Fig. 2C), the latter showing fibroblastoid￾characteristic stress fiber formation. We validated this by qRT￾PCR for a-SMA (Fig. 2D), showing maximal induction after 96 h
with a mean fold increase of 8, 98, and 118 for IL-1b, TNF-a, and
TGF-b, respectively. As such, the a-SMA expression analysis
substantiated the differential ability to induce a mesenchymal
phenotype, the potency being TGF-b.TNF-a..IL-1b.
Classic transcriptional regulators of EMT include Twist-1, Snail
and Slug, which all act as repressors of E-cadherin. Accordingly,
we found Slug to be significantly up-regulated (approximately 3-
fold) after 48 h with TNF-a or TGF-b stimulation (Fig. 2E), while
differential loss of E-cadherin was less prominent (Fig. 2F).
However, no significant changes were detected in Twist-1 and
Snail mRNA levels (results not shown). This may however be
explained by the relative high basal levels of Twist-1 and Snail in
EMCs (Fig. S2), which is in agreement with a recent report on
TGF-b-treated human pulmonary valve progenitor cells [39].
Additionally, we performed phenotypic measurements over
time in the IL-1b-, TNF-a- or TGF-b stimulated EMCs (Fig. S3).
In accordance with EMT progression [40], we measured a 70%
reduction in cell number after 96 h of TGF-b incubation (Fig. S3A
and S3C) and a parallel 20% increase in cell volumes for TNF-a
and TGF-b treated EMCs (Fig. S3B). We also found a 4-fold
induction of TIMP-1 (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1) after
TGF-b incubation (Fig. S3D). Taken together, this comprehensive
analysis of EMT biomarkers showed that in vitro cultures of EMCs
undergo EMT in response to different inducers, with the potency
being TGF-b1. TNF-a..IL-1b.
miR-21 is the Major Up-regulated miRNA during EMT
To assess which miRNAs are implicated in cardiac fibrogenic
EMT, we performed miRNA microarray profiling of EMCs
treated for 48 h with IL-1b, TNF-a, and TGF-b. As expected
from the observed differential power of fibrogenic EMT induction,
each of the three different treatments resulted in a distinct miRNA
fingerprint (Table S2). More importantly, miR-21 was by far the

for E-cadherin expression (A), a-SMA expression (B), TIMP-1 (C) in the culture medium (ELISA) as well as cell number (D), mean cell diameter (E), and
cell motility (F) by the relative wound size closure in a scratch assay. qRT-PCR data were normalized against GAPDH and RPL13A. All data are

each treatment and one-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey’s post test compared treatment effects within the PDCD4- and SPRY1-specific experiments.

most up-regulated miRNA in all the treatments (Fig. 3A). We
found this novel regulation of miR-21 in cardiac EMT highly
remarkable, as miR-21 has been extensively implicated in cardiac
disease [17,18,19,23,41,42,43]. The up-regulation of miR-21 was
validated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3B), with TGF-b again being the
most potent inducer, and we therefore decided to focus on TGF-b￾induced EMT in the remaining part of the study. Interestingly,
when testing if the array data had significance in vivo, we found a
time-dependent miR-21 up-regulation (Fig. 3C, 3D) in two
different models of cardiac remodeling in which EMT of EMCs
is known to contribute [8], namely both TAC (Fig. 3C) and LAD
ligation (Fig. 3D). Before miR-21 profiling, the TAC and LAD
ligation models were validated for development of cardiac
remodeling, as verified by elevated ANP, BNP, a-SMA and
TGF-b expression over time (results not shown). Overall, the
results from the miRNA array (Fig. 3A, 3B) combined with the
data from the TAC (Fig. 3C) and the LAD ligation (Fig. 3D)
model, underscored miR-21 as a major candidate of fibrogenic
modulation in the heart, including EMT in EMCs.
miR-21 Alone Promotes Fibrogenic EMT
We next asked if the robust miR-21 up-regulation also had a
functional effect on the development of the mesenchymal,
fibroblast-like phenotype generated by fibrogenic EMT. We first

EMT biomarkers through miR-21-dependent mechanisms.

over-expressed miR-21 (‘‘Pre-miR-21’’) in non-stimulated EMCs,
to test if miR-21 alone was able to induce the mesenchymal cell
characteristics. Initially, qRT-PCR for miR-21 showed that pre￾miR-21 transfected cells expressed 120631 fold more miR-21
than the control (scramble transfected cells) (Table 1) verifying
robust over-expression. We then examined EMT biomarkers in
miR-21 over-expressing cells, and found that miR-21 had a
mesenchymal promoting effect, highly similar to that observed
during TGF-b-induced EMT (Table 1). Accordingly, we found a
reduction in E-cadherin expression (230%) and cell number (240
to 213%), while a-SMA expression (2 to 22-fold), TIMP-1
production (+40 to +230%), cell volume (+4 to +8%) and motility
(+23 to +45%) were all increased (Table 1 and Fig. S5). To
confirm these data, we additionally knocked down endogenous
miR-21 using an antagonist (‘‘a-miR-21’’) during TGF-b-induced
EMT. As expected, these experiments clearly showed that
development of the mesenchymal phenotype was indeed inhibited
by the loss of miR-21 (Table 1). Together these data suggest that
miR-21 plays a major role in promoting the phenotypic shift
observed during EMT of EMCs.
PDCD4 and SPRY1 are Targets of miR-21 in Fibrogenic
EMT
Next, we questioned how miR-21 exerts these substantial effects
on fibroblast-committed EMT of EMCs. Not only has miR-21
been identified as a driver of cardiac disease, but also substantially
implicated and characterized in cancer conditions, and from these
studies a plethora of direct miR-21 targets have been validated (by
e.g. luciferase reporter assays), especially PDCD4, SPRY1, and
reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich with kazal motifs (RECK), which
regulates biological processes inherent to EMT [44]. Testing these
putative targets, we found that PDCD4 and SPRY1 were
expressed in EMCs, with a nucleic and cytosolic localization,
respectively, and that TGF-b treatment substantially reduced the
levels of these proteins, concomitant to the up-regulation of a￾SMA (Fig. 4A). RECK was not assessed on the protein level in
EMCs, but following TGF-b incubation for 48 h the RECK
mRNA expression was significantly reduced (P = 0.0217; Fig. 4D),
along with PDCD4 (P = 0.0040; Fig. 4B) and SPRY1 (P = 0.0414;
Fig. 4C) mRNA expression (Figure 4B). To evaluate if these target
reductions were consequences of miR-21 targeting, we measured
the mRNA expression of PDCD4, SPRY1, and RECK following
EMC transfection with pre-miR-21 or anti-miR-21, the latter
performed during TGF-b-induced EMT. Hence, we found that
PDCD4 (Fig. 4B) and to a lesser extent SPRY1 (Fig. 4C) were
significantly targeted by miR-21 in EMCs, while RECK (Fig. 4D)
was not, and we thus focused on PDCD4 and SPRY1 in the
remaining part of the study. We then confirmed that also the
protein level of PDCD4 was significantly rescued by anti-miR-21
(1.6660.11, P = 0.0086; Fig. 4E), while SPRY1 protein regulation
was experimentally undetectable (results not shown).
MiR-21 Promotes a Mesenchymal Phenotype in an
Interplay with PDCD4 and SPRY1
We finally hypothesized that the observed effects of miR-21 on
EMT biomarkers (Table 1) was a result of its direct down￾regulation of PDCD4 and/or SPRY1. We therefore co-transfected
TGF-b-stimulated EMCs with anti-miR-21 and either a control
siRNA (a-CTL), a siRNA against PDCD4 (a-PDCD4), or a
siRNA against SPRY1 (a-SPRY1). Hence, by analyzing biomark￾er read-outs by one-way ANOVAs, we could assess whether miR￾21 regulated the EMT biomarkers through PDCD4 and/or
SPRY1 in case the effect from inhibiting miR-21 by anti-miR-21
was lost when PDCD4 or SPRY1 was concurrently targeted by
siRNAs.
In accordance with Table 1, we again found that all EMT
biomarkers were regulated by miR-21 (Figs. 5 and 6), except the
mean cell diameter (Fig. 5E). E-cadherin expression (Fig. 5A),
TIMP-1 (Fig. 5C), cell number (Fig. 5D), and cell motility (Fig. 5F)
were regulated through PDCD4 via miR-21 since a-CTL+anti￾miR-21 vs. a-PDCD4+a-miR-21 was significant different in these
instances. The investigated EMT biomarkers were less regulated
by SPRY1, implicating only significant miR-21-dependent target￾ing in case of cell motility (a-CTL+anti-miR-21 vs. a-PDCD4+a￾miR-21, P,0.01; Fig. 5F and Fig. S8). These data thus suggest
that miR-21 regulates fibrogenic cardiac EMT through direct
targeting of PDCD4 and SPRY1 (Fig. 7), but that other miR-21
specific targets must also be involved to account for the measured
phenotypic effects of anti-miR-21 (Table 1).
Discussion
In the present study, we support other reports on the existence
of adult fibrogenic EMT of the EMCs lining the epicardium
[4,5,6,7,8] and propose a model of how fibrogenic EMT of EMCs
is controlled at the level of miRNAs (Fig. 7). We implicate TGF-b
as a far more potent EMT-inducer in EMCs than TNF-a and
especially IL-1b, and detected substantial differentiation into
myofibroblastic cells for TGF-b incubation, as measured by
various markers, including development of stress fibers of a-SMA
(Fig. 2C). Despite this differential potency in inducing EMT, miR￾21 was the most up-regulated miRNA induced by all three stimuli.
Notably, IL-1b and TNF-a induced miR-21 at equal levels
(Fig. 3B), but TNF-a was far more potent in inducing EMT, which
is likely an outcome of differential induction of the molecular pool
unrelated to miR-21 effects. As such, the more diverse TNF-a
signaling, including caspase 8-mediated death signaling [45],
might promote EMT more compared to the classic NF-kB/
MAPK pathways of IL-1b [46], or that IL-1b also induces factors
that act to hamper EMT, while TNF-a may not.
Importantly, miR-21 manipulations showed substantial impact
on EMC phenotype, since overexpression of miR-21 in EMCs
markedly promoted biomarkers of fibrogenic EMT, while
fibrogenic EMT was substantially inhibited when a miR-21
antagonist was present during EMT (Table 1). We observed more
impact from the miR-21 antagonist than the miR-21 mimic. This
is likely because anti-miR-21 transfection was performed 20 h
after EMCs had undergone TGF-b treatment and readouts
assessed after another 24 h of incubation in TGF-b, while Pre￾miR-21 transfection was performed on resting EMCs and the
phenotype was evaluated after 48 h.
Our results indentify miR-21 as a key regulator of fibrogenic
EMT of EMCs, which is in parallel to an increasing number of
reports documenting high significance of miR-21 in cardiac
diseases. As reported by several independent groups, analyses on
both patient samples [17,18,19,20] along with animal injury
models [17,23,41,42,43,47,48], miR-21 is implicated in cardiac
hypertrophy, proliferative vascular disease and ischemic heart
disease. We furthermore show that miR-21 is up-regulated in a
time-dependent manner during TAC (Fig. 3C) and LAD (Fig. 3D),
and not only in later strict fibrosis-associated phases, but that miR￾21 up-regulation is already substantial at very early time-points
dominated by inflammatory phases, characterized by e.g. high
levels of pro-inflammatory molecules such IL-1b [46] and TNF-a
[45]. However, recent contradictory results on the involvement of
miR-21 in cardiac disease imply that more studies are needed to
elucidate miR-219s role in the heart [49,50].

Nevertheless, miR-21 has been associated with cell survival and
hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes [23,43,47], whereas in vascular
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, miR-21 promotes cellular
activity in the direction of remodeling, which can be reduced or
even reversed by miR-21 antagonists [22,23,41,51,52], supporting
our results. Additionally, we show that the miR-21-mediated
PDCD4- and SPRY1-targeting promotes a number of mesenchy￾mal, fibrogenic markers in EMCs. We therefore propose that miR￾21 mediates cardiac remodeling also through EMT of EMCs,
partly through a PDCD4- and SPRY1-dependent mechanism
(Fig. 7). As such, miR-21 may skew the EMC progenitor potential
towards remodeling, rather than regeneration.
At the molecular level, several miR-21 targets have been
experimentally validated in several biological systems. In cardiac
disease, functional assessment of miR-21 implicates PDCD4
[41,48,52,53], SPRY1 [22] or SPRY2 [54], Phosphatase and
tensin homolog [23,29,55], and Fas ligand [55] as the major
targets of miR-21. Our data solidly support the involvement of
PDCD4 and SPRY1 in miR-21-regulated fibrogenic processes in
the heart. However, the phenotypic measurements also suggest
that other targets of miR-21 are involved in cardiac fibrogenic
EMT, since e.g. a-SMA was regulated through a miR-21-
dependent mechanism (Table 1), which could not be proven to
occur through PDCD4 or SPRY1 (Figs. 5B and 6). This supports
the notion that a single miRNA may regulate several target
mRNAs [56] and furthermore supports that miR-21 is a
pleiotropic acting miRNA within biological systems such as
cancers and cardiovascular diseases [57]. In this study, we focused
on miR-21 targets relating downstream to the MAPK/NF-kB
pathways as all three tested EMT inducers can signal through
those, but in relation to TGF-b-induced EMT it would be relevant
to further explore miR-21 targets relating the TGF-b pathway to
account for the missing functional effect from miR-21 at the level
of downstream targets (Fig. 5). However, Smad7, which have been
shown to be a miR-21 target in pulmonary fibrosis [58], does not
appear to be implicated in our culture system, since we registered
no significant regulation of Smad7 expression during EMT (Fig.
S9).
Our miRNA array data show many differentially regulated
miRNAs besides miR-21 (Fig. 3 and Table S2). However, the
effects from miR-21 account for up to 50% or even more on the
investigated fibrogenic EMT biomarkers (Table 1), substantiating
that miR-21 is not only the most regulated miRNA, but also a
functionally outmost important miRNA during cardiac fibrogenic
EMT. Similar to our results, two reports on TGF-b-induced EMT
in human keratinocytes [24] and a colon carcinoma cell line [27]
both identified miR-21 as the major up-regulated miRNA during
EMT, and a recent study on TGF-b-induced cardiac EndMT
showed that miR-21 promoted EndMT through targeting of the
PTEN/Akt pathway [29]. In addition, miR-21 targeting of
PDCD4 and RECK has been identified as a driver of branching
morphogenesis of the epithelium in the submandibular gland [59].
However, other in vitro studies of TGF-b-induced EMT have
identified miR-155, by RhoA targeting [60], and especially the
miR-200 family in tumor metastasis, by targeting E-cadherin
transcriptional repressors ZEB1/ZEB2 [25,26,28], as EMT￾promoting miRNAs. Owing to the different nature of the epithelial
cell lines used in those studies compared to the mesothelial cardiac
origin of the EMCs in our study, the miRNA fingerprint along
with the differential miRNA expression during EMT is expected
to differ substantially. Furthermore, since rat-derived EMCs were
used, and miR-155 is not annotated in the rat (miRBase 10.0–
15.0), we could not assess miR-155 in our analyses.
In summary, miR-21 promotes robust fibrogenic EMT of
EMCs, in part by directly targeting PDCD4 and SPRY1. Due to
the multipotency of EMCs, our results implicate miR-21 as a
relevant target to reduce the differentiation of EMCs into
fibroblast-like cells, which may favor commitment into the
vasculogenic/angiogenic or even the myogenic lineage.
