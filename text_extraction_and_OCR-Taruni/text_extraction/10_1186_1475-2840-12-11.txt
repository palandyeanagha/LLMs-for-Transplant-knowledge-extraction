Abstract
Background: Osteoprotegerin is a member of the tumor necrosis factor-related family and inhibits RANK
stimulation of osteoclast formation as a soluble decoy receptor. The goal of this study was to determine the
relationship of serum osteoprotegerin with vascular calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: The subjects were 124 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 88 males and 36 females with a
mean (± SD) age of 65.6 ± 8.2 years old. Serum levels of osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23
(FGF23), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and adiponectin were measured by ELISA. Vascular calcification in the cervical artery
was examined by ultrasound sonography. The subjects were divided into 4 quartiles depending on serum
osteoprotegerin levels.
Results: Vascular calcification was significantly higher in the 4th quartile and significantly lower in the 1st quartile
of serum osteoprotegerin levels, compared to other quartiles. There were no differences in serum osteoprotegerin
and vascular calcification among patients with different stages of diabetic nephropathy, but serum FGF23 levels
were elevated in those with stage 4 diabetic nephropathy. Simple regression analysis showed that serum
osteoprotegerin levels had significant positive correlations with age, systolic blood pressure and serum adiponectin
levels, and significant negative correlations with BMI and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that elevated serum osteoprotegerin may be involved in vascular calcification
independently of progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Background
Atherosclerosis, macroangiopathy and microangiopathy
are major prognostic factors in diabetes. Vascular endo￾thelial impairment is the initial pathological change and
is profoundly involved in development of atherosclerosis
[1-4]. Progression of diabetic nephropathy, including
microalbuminuria, is a risk factor for atherosclerosis in
type 2 diabetes mellitus [5,6] and diabetic patients with
advanced nephropathy (particularly those on dialysis
with end-stage kidney disease) often have vascular calci￾fication [7-10]. However, the duration of diabetes melli￾tus is not closely related to the extent of vascular
calcification, and this condition may be more strongly
related to biochemical changes.
The RANK/RANKL interaction induces osteoclast for￾mation in vascular smooth muscle cells such as those in
bone [11]. Osteoprotegerin, a member of the tumor ne￾crosis factor (TNF)-related family [12], binds to RANKL
as a soluble decoy receptor, and consequently inhibits
RANK stimulation of osteoclast formation [13]. This
suggests that interactions among RANK, RANKL and
osteoprotegerin influence osteoclastogenesis and vascu￾lar calcification. Therefore, in the present study, we
examined the relationship of osteoprotegerin with vascu￾lar calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes without
advanced nephropathy. * Correspondence: saneiskw@jichi.ac.jp

Methods
Subjects
A total of 124 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at
the outpatient clinic of Jichi Medical University Saitama
Medical Center were enrolled in the study between
March 2006 and October 2011. The subjects included
88 males and 36 females, and had a mean (± SD) age of
65.6 ± 8.2 years old (range: 44 to 82 years old). Type 2
diabetes was diagnosed using Japan Diabetes Society cri￾teria. The mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c: NGSP) was
7.7 ± 1.4% and the duration of diabetes mellitus was
14.7 ± 8.2 years. Of the 124 subjects, 65 had hyperten￾sion, 74 had dyslipidemia, 35 were obese, 40 were current
smokers, 46 had diabetic retinopathy, 64 had diabetic
nephropathy, and 56 had diabetic neuropathy. Patients with
end-stage kidney diseases, use of nitroglycerin as mainte￾nance medication, infectious disease, malignancy, and a
history of intrapelvic surgery were excluded from the study.
Blood samples were collected from subjects in the sit￾ting position at a visit to the outpatient clinic after an
overnight fast. HbA1c (NGSP), serum total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipopro￾tein cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, phosphorus, creati￾nine, serum osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, fibroblast growth
factor (FGF) 23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and adiponectin
were measured in these samples. Urine samples were col￾lected to determine urinary excretion of albumin. Ultra￾sound sonography of the cervical carotid artery and
endothelial function tests of flow-mediated dilatation
(FMD) and nitroglycerine-mediated dilatation (NMD)
were also performed. The study was approved by the ethi￾cal committee of Jichi Medical University for human stu￾dies. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Regarding risk factors for atherosclerosis, hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg, dia￾stolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg, or a history of admin￾istration of antihypertensive agents; dyslipidemia as a
total cholesterol level >2 20 mg/dl, high-density lipopro￾tein cholesterol level < 40 mg/dl, and triglyceride level
> 150 mg/dl, or a history of administration of statins or
fibrates; obesity as BMI > 25 (Japanese patients); and a
current smoker as a subject who had smoked more than
one cigarette per day within the last 3 months.
For progression of nephropathy, the subjects were
divided into stages 1–5 based on the classification of dia￾betic nephropathy by the Research Committee of the
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare for Dis￾orders of Diabetes Mellitus.
Measurements
Blood samples were collected into tubes and centrifuged
at 3,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatants were
decanted and frozen at −80°C until assayed. HbA1c
was measured by HPLC using an ADAMS™ A1c HA￾8160 instrument (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). The value for
HbA1c (%) is estimated as a National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) equivalent value (%), cal￾culated by the formula HbA1c (%) = HbA1c (Japan Dia￾betes Society, JDS) (%) + 0.4% [14]. ELISA kits were used
to measure the serum levels of osteoprotegerin (Bio
Vendor, Modrice, Czech Republic), osteocalcin (Biomedical
Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA, USA), FGF23 (Kainos,
Tokyo, Japan), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (Immundiagnostik
AG., Bensheim, Germany), and adiponectin (Otsuka
Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The minimal levels of
detection and interassay and intraassay coefficients of va￾riation were 0.2 pg/ml, 5.8% and 3.5%, respectively, for
osteoprotegerin; 0.5 ng/ml, 10.5% and 7.0%, respectively,
for osteocalcin; 3 pg/ml, 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively, for
FGF23; 12 nmol/l, 7.0% and 7.0%, respectively, for 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3; and 0.375 μg/ml, < 10% and < 10%, re￾spectively, for adiponectin. Urinary excretion of albumin
was determined by a latex agglutination immunoassay
(Eiken, Tokyo). Renal function was calculated as the esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modifi￾cation of Diet in Renal Disease equation (MDRD) revised
for Japanese subjects by the Japan Society of Nephrology.
Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)
Endothelial function was evaluated by FMD, which indi￾cates an arterial response to reactive hyperemia causing
endothelial-dependent dilatation [15,16]. FMD of the right
brachial artery was determined by one investigator (AA)
between 16:00 and 18:00 hours after a 15-minute rest,
using a 12-MHz ultrasound instrument (UNEXEF18G,
UNEX Corp., Nagoya, Japan), as previously described [17].
The brachial artery was imaged in the longitudinal section
just above the antecubital fossa and internal diameters
from the anterior to posterior intimal interfaces were mea￾sured at end-diastole using B-mode imaging as baseline. A
pneumatic cuff was inflated on the forearm at a pressure
of more than 50 mmHg higher than systolic blood pres￾sure for 5 min. The intravascular blood flow velocities and
vessel diameter were measured from 20 to 120 s after cuff
deflation in the same manner as that as baseline. FMD
was calculated as the % increase in vessel diameter
following reactive hyperemia: (maximum diameter
following reactive hyperemia-baseline diameter)/baseline
diameter ×100. At 15 min after the FMD measurement,
NMD (endothelium-independent dilatation) was measured
following administration of sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3
mg-spray. The maximum vessel diameter produced by
nitroglycerin was measured 4 min after administration and
NMD was calculated.
Carotid artery sonogram
A carotid artery sonogram for determination of intima￾media thickness (IMT) and arterial wall calcification was
Aoki et al. Cardiovascular Diabetology 2013, 12:11 Page 2 of 8
http://www.cardiab.com/content/12/1/11

performed according to the standard method for ultra￾sound evaluation of carotid artery lesions [18]. Briefly,
measurements of IMT in bilateral carotid arteries were
obtained in each subject using a 7.5-MHz ultrasound in￾strument (Prosound SSD-4000SV, Hitachi Aloka Medical,
Tokyo, Japan). The IMT was defined as the distance be￾tween the leading edge of the lumen-intima echo and the
leading edge of the media-adventitia echo. The mean IMT
was obtained from measurements performed on the right
and left common carotid artery, excluding the bulbus, as
an average of 3 points after measurement of IMT at the
point of max IMT and two points on both sides (each 1
cm distant from the point of max IMT). Arterial calcifica￾tion was determined at the same points by evaluating the
medial calcification (Monckeberg’s arteriosclerosis) and
intimal calcification (atherosclerosis).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Values were ana￾lyzed by Student t-test and one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to compare differences between the groups.
Corresponding data were analyzed by Student paired t-test.
Categorical data were analyzed by a chi-square test for in￾dependence. For regression analysis, log transformation
was used to normalize the distribution of serum levels of
osteoprotegerin, FGF23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and adipo￾nectin. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to
calculate correlation coefficients. All calculations were per￾formed using SPSSW Statistics 18.0 (Japan IBM., Tokyo,
Japan) and a two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.
Results
The subjects were divided into quartiles using levels of
osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, FGF23, and 25-hydroxyvitamin
D3, and the presence or absence of cervical arterial cal￾cification was evaluated in each quartile (Table 1).
Based on the serum osteoprotegerin levels, significantly
greater vascular calcification was present in subjects in
the 4th quartile and significantly less vascular calcifica￾tion was present in those in the 1st quartile compared
to other quartiles (Table 1). The reverse result was
found for the absence of calcification (Figure 1). The
quartiles based on serum osteocalcin, FGF23 and 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 levels did not show any relationship
with vascular calcification.
Clinical and laboratory data for the quartiles based on
serum osteoprotegerin levels are shown in Table 2. Age
and serum adiponectin levels increased with higher serum
osteoprotegerin levels (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively,
in trend tests), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels
were significantly lower in the 4th quartile (P =0.002 ).
Vascular calcification and other parameters in the sub￾jects based on clinical stages of diabetic nephropathy,
a microvascular angiopathy, are shown in Table 3. Serum
creatinine and albuminuria increased and eGFR
decreased with progression of nephropathy. Serum
FGF23 was elevated in subjects with stage 4 nephro￾pathy (P = 0.007), whereas osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin,
and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 did not differ significantly
among the stages of diabetic nephropathy. There was also
no tendency for alterations in vascular calcification among
the stages of nephropathy.
The results of simple regression analysis of variables
associated with serum osteoprotegerin levels in the sub￾jects are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2. Serum osteoprote￾gerin levels were positively correlated with age (p < 0.0001),
systolic blood pressure (P=0.03), and serum adiponectin
levels (P = 0.0008); and negatively correlated with BMI
(P = 0.045) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (P = 0.001).
Discussion
The results of the study demonstrate that vascular calcifi￾cation is closely associated with serum osteoprotegerin
levels in patients with diabetes [19], but is not linked to
other bone-related humoral factors including osteocalcin,
FGF23, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Osteoprotegerin may
directly affect osteoblastic changes of vascular smooth
muscle cells and is not mediated through other factors or
ions [12,13]. This differs from the effect of FGF23 on vas￾cular calcification, since FGF23 regulates phosphate meta￾bolism in kidney and promotes vascular calcification in
association with phosphate [20]. In this study, we examined
diabetic patients with mild or moderate renal impairment,
including subjects with diabetic nephropathy of stages 1–4,
since patients with advanced nephropathy may have vascu￾lar calcification without any interaction with cytokines [7].
FMD is a good indicator for vascular endothelial func￾tion and was found to be unrelated to serum osteoprote￾gerin or vascular calcification. These findings indicate
that elevated serum osteoprotegerin may be involved in
vascular calcification in patients with diabetes, independ￾ently of progression of diabetic nephropathy. However,
because the study was performed as a cross-sectional
observation, the finding of an association of serum
osteoprotegerin and vascular calcification is limited and
cannot suggest causality. However, osteoprotegerin may
be clinically useful as a biochemical marker of vascular
damage and overall burden of atherosclerotic disorders.
In fact, serum osteoprotegerin is known to be associated
with carotid and peripheral arterial disease in patients
with type 2 diabetes [21] and is inversely associated with
aortic distensibility [22]. Osteoprotegerin is also an inde￾pendent predictor of coronary artery disease in asymp￾tomatic type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria
[23] and is also predictive of the long-term outcome in
patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated
with percutaneous coronary intervention [24].

Osteoprotegerin is a member of the TNF-related family
[12] and exerts its major biological action through binding
to RANKL as a soluble decoy receptor, with resulting in￾hibition of RANK stimulation of osteoclast differentiation
and bone resorption [13,25]. RANKL and osteoprotegerin
are expressed in osteoblasts, and the receptor RANK is
expressed in osteoclasts cells [25]. In vascular beds, endo￾thelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells produce
osteoprotegerin, but do not produce RANK and RANKL
[11,13,26,27]. However, both RANKL and RANK expres￾sion have been detected in atherosclerotic lesions [28-30].
This may indicate that the RANK-RANKL interaction
induces osteoclast formation and that osteoprotegerin
blocks this interaction to reduce arterial calcification
[11,31,32]. Therefore, vascular calcification linked to
RANK-RANKL is independent of advanced vascular da￾mage related to a long duration of diabetes, progression of
diabetic microvascular complications, and abnormal me￾tabolism of calcium or phosphate associated with FGF23,
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and other factors. In the present
study, we could not determine how the RANK/RANKL
system participates in development of osteoclast differen￾tiation in the vasculature in the non-advanced stage
of diabetes mellitus. However, our findings suggest that
vascular calcification may develop in patients with dia￾betes with high serum osteoprotegerin levels, even if

microvascular and macrovascular disorders do not be￾come manifest. The elevation of serum osteoprotegerin
might be associated with underlying alterations in RANK/
RANKL interactions in the vascular wall.
Vascular calcification is common in patients with dia￾betes, and especially in those with diabetic nephropathy
[8-10]. We have shown that coronary artery calcification
is significantly increased in advanced diabetic nephropathy
based on histology of intravascular ultrasound [7]. In such
cases, abnormal calcium or phosphorus metabolism may
also be involved in vascular calcification, in association
with FGF23 or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [20,33]. As shown
in Table 3, we found no relationship of vascular calcifica￾tion or serum osteoprotegerin levels with diabetic nephro￾pathy, and only 6 of the 124 subjects in the study had
stage 4 diabetic nephropathy. Thus, most had no or mild
nephropathy, making it evident that progression of vascu￾lar calcification is not simply associated with diabetic
nephropathy.
BMI, systolic blood pressure, adiponectin and 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 were among the factors correlated with
serum osteoprotegerin in simple linear regression analysis.
There was a highly significant positive correlation between
serum adiponectin and serum osteoprotegerin. In bone tis￾sue, adiponectin stimulates RANKL in osteoclasts, thus in￾ducing osteoclastogenesis [34]. In contrast, adiponectin
inhibits osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts [34]. The positive
correlation between serum adiponectin and osteoprote￾gerin [35] indicates that serum adiponectin may interact
with osteoprotegerin for modulating osteoclast formation.
Serum osteoprotegerin had a negative correlation with
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Several studies have
examined the effect of vitamin D3 on osteoprotegerin

synthesis [36] and it has been shown that active 1α, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 upregulates the level of RANKL, but
downregulates osteoprotegerin expression in human pe￾riodontal ligament cells by accelerating degradation of
osteoprotegerin mRNA and transrepressing the osteopro￾tegerin gene [37,38]. This indicates that active vitamin D3
promotes osteoclastogenesis. Similar interactions of osteo￾protegerin with adiponectin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
may occur in vascular tissues, particularly with regard to
the vascular calcification evaluated in this study.
Conclusions
Serum osteoprotegerin levels were closely associated with
vascular calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Serum osteoprotegerin interacts with RANK/RANKL as a
soluble decoy receptor to prevent osteoclast differentiation,
and the elevation of serum osteoprotegerin might be linked
to underlying alterations in RANK/RANKL interactions in
the vascular wall. The levels of vascular calcification and
serum osteoprotegerin were independent of progression of
diabetic nephropathy. These findings indicate that elevated
serum osteoprotegerin may be involved in vascular calcifi￾cation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
