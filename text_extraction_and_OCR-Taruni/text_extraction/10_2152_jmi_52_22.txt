INTRODUCTION
Since the first liver transplant from a living donor
(living donor liver transplantation : LDLT) was con￾ducted in Japan, about 15 years have passed. At the
beginning, the LDLT was regarded as an emergency
procedure until the availability of liver transplantation
(LTx) from deceased donors. However, in Japan, the
number of deceased donors is also very small since
the Organ Transplantation law was enacted in October
1997. The LDLT serves as standard medical treatment
of end-stage liver disease in Japan. Since it is trans￾planted from a living donor, the characteristic advan￾tage to which a liver transplant from a living donor
greatly differs from the LTx from deceased donors is
that the transplantable liver is of good quality in the
first place. The donor livers can be evaluated, and be
adequately prepared before transplantation. Further￾more, operations for both the donor and the recipient
can be simultaneously performed, therefore, both warm
and cold ischemic time can be minimized. As a result,
well-suited livers are procured. Secondly, it is being
able to choose the time of the transplant operation.
Since the donor has determined beforehand, an op￾eration can be on standby-conducted for him in accor￾dance with the state of the recipients. Thirdly, since
the donor and recipient are relatives, as one specific
donor to one specific recipient, the indications for an
LTx may be expanded compared to an LTx from a
deceased donor. On the other hand, many problems,
such as size mismatching, an ABO-blood type incom￾patible transplantation, the expansion of indication to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a recurrence of post￾operative hepatitis C, and the donor’s safety, are sur￾facing according to the increase in the expansion of
indication and number of cases after introduction of
the LDLT between an adult donor and an adult recipi￾ent. This article describes the present status and fu￾ture perspective of the LDLT.

Abstract : About 15 years have passed since the first liver transplant from a living donor (living
donor liver transplantation : LDLT), and the status of the procedure has since been established
as a standard cure for end-stage liver disease in Japan where liver transplantation (LTx) from
deceased donors has not yet been accepted. However, the following problems are surfacing
with the increase in the number of LDLTs between adults : graft size mismatching, an ABO
blood-type incompatible transplantation, the expansion of LDLT indication to hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), the relapse of hepatitis C after LDLT, marginal donors, and the freedom
from immunosuppressive treatment. In this article we outline the present conditions of these
problems and the future view of the LDLT. J. Med. Invest. 52 : 22-32, February, 2005

THE HISTORY AND THE PRESENT STATUS
OF LDLT (Table 1)
After the world’s first LTx was performed by Pro￾fessor Starzl (Denver, USA) in 1963, the LTx from a
non-heart beating donor was performed by Nakayama
in Japan in 1964. Although the organ transplantation
spread globally through the improvement of immuno￾suppressants in the 1980s, some patients in Japan went
over to the West to receive a LTx. Raia1of Brazil en￾forced the first LDLT in 1987(1) as a promising method
to resolve a chronic organ shortage of potential liver
transplants for a child. Since the LTx from deceased
donors did not progress in Japan, the first LDLT in
Japan was enforced by Nagasue and others in a case
involving a boy with biliary atrasia in November 1989
(2). Makuuchi and others (3) succeeded in the world’s
first LDLT between an adult donor and an adult recipi￾ent in November 1993. Although the Organ Transplan￾tation law was enacted in 1997 and the increase in LTx
from deceased donors was expected, the number of
cases involving LTx remains at 26 cases and about sev￾eral cases per year till present. Thereafter, the LDLT
was the accepted treatment in 2,666 cases in 49 insti￾tutions by the end of 2003 in Japan, although at the
beginning the LDLT was regarded as an emergency
procedure to establish LTx from deceased donors. The
demand for LDLT is further expanded due to the se￾rious shortage of donors. Moreover, the LDLT was
covered by medical insurance, and the LDLT has also
been established as a practical solution to address the
organ-shortage in Japan. The LDLT has been rapidly
developed also in the West where the shortage of do￾nors is serious. According to the data collected by UNOS

(United Network for Organ Sharing), while the waiting
list for LTx in the United States amounts to 17,389 cases,
the number of LTx cases in 2003 per year remains at
5,994 cases, including 315 LDLTs. Thus, judging from
the present problem concerning global organ shortage,
the use of LDLT is expected to increase from now on.
According to the data of the Japanese Liver Transplan￾tation Society (4), the adult-to-to-adult LDLT is increas￾ing per year, on the other hand, the child cases have
reached a peak aroud 100 cases per years (Fig. 1). The
1, 3, and 5-year survival rates of all recipients are 81.8%,
79.5%, and 77.7%, respectively, while those of child re￾cipients of less than 18 years old in age is 85.6%, 84.1%
and 82.6%, respectively. In the adult recipients, the 1, 3,
and 5-year survival rates are 75.6%, 71.7%, and 69.1%,
and the prognosis of adult recipients is clearly poor
(Fig. 2). Therefore, various kinds of treatments are
used to improve the outcome of the adult recipients.

PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED
The LDLT is being established as a general medical
treatment of various kinds of end-stage liver diseases.
On the other hand, it is thought that the original disease
recurrence such as hepatitis C and HCC has influenced
a significant decline in the survival rate of adult cases.
Moreover, the living donor’s mortality and need of LTx
due to a postoperative hepatic insufficiency raised a
critical social concern in Europe and the United States.
Also in Japan, a living donor’s death was reported in
May 2003(5). It is necessary to reevaluate the donor’s
selection standard and safety anew because of the
experience of a donor’s morbidity and mortality. The
following critical problems remain which should be
urgently solved: 1) graft size mismatching, 2) ABO
blood-type incompatible transplantation, 3) the expan￾sion of LDLT indication to HCC, 4) the relapse of hepa￾titis C, 5) marginal donors, and 6) the freedom from
the immunosuppressants.
1. Graft size mismatching
The minimally required quantity of graft volume has
not been fully clarified, which is one of the biggest issues
of the adult-to-adult LDLT. The following two methods
exist to express the graft volume : 1) the ratio of graft
volume (GV) in the standard liver volume (SLV) of re￾cipient, which is calculated by the recipient’s height
and body weight, and 2) the ratio of graft weight in the
recipient’s weight (GRWR ; graft to recipient weight
ratio). The safe limit of small-for-size graft is reported
to be set from 30% to 40% in GV/SLV(6, 7), while from
0.6 to 0.8% in GRWR (8, 9). To increase the graft vol￾ume, a left lobe graft with a caudate lobe is often used
(10 -12). As an alternative, an APOLT (auxiliary partial
orthotopic liver transplantation) was applied in those
who deviate from this safe limit of the graft volume
(13). From the beginning, the APOLT was expected
to play a role in providing temporary support for trans￾plant patients with fulminant hepatitis while they were
waiting for the regeneration of the native liver. However,
this was not generalized from the difficult hepatectomy
of a morbid liver and possible disease transmission
from the preserved native liver to a new liver graft.
In order to conquer this problem (small-for-size graft),
the right lobe graft which occupies about two thirds
of the liver has been frequently used. Herein, the patho￾physiology and cause-oriented strategy are described
about a small-for-size graft or a large-for-size graft.
a) Small-for-size graft
The patient, who received a small-for-size graft, ex￾hibited persistent functional hyperbilirubinemia, in￾tractable ascites, graft dysfunction leading to serious
conditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding and renal
failure. (14-16) The characteristic histological findings
are as follows: hepatocellular ballooning, fatty degen￾eration, hemorrhagic necrosis, and cholestasis around
the central vein so called zone 3. We have advocated
the following mechanisms for the small-for-size graft :
1) superfluous portal blood flow, 2) insufficient hepatic
venous drainage, 3) absolute shortage of functional
liver mass, and 4) inappropriate intragraft responses,
as shown in Fig.4. Against the superfluous portal flow,
which causes sinusoidal endothelial injury immediately
after reperfusion (17, 18), the reduction of portal pressure
or portal flow by splenectomy, splenic artery ligation
(19-21), or a porto-systemic shunting (22, 23) was rec￾ommended. To counteract the insufficient hepatic ve￾nous outflow, the venoplasty in a left lobe graft or aggres￾sive reconstruction of the venous tributaries from the
middle hepatic vein is performed to prevent graft con￾gestion, one of the key factors for a successful outcome
(Fig. 5)(11, 24). The 3-dimensional computed tomogra￾phy(3D-CT) is useful to assess the congestion area
in the graft prior to operation (Fig. 6). Against the abso￾lute shortage of functional liver mass, a hyperbaric
oxygen treatment or intraportal infusion of drugs (25)
has been reported. Recently, as a next-generation strat￾egy, we are developing a bioartificial liver for the
period until the transplanted graft obtains sufficient
liver volume and function (26, 27). To counteract inap￾propriate responses, the breakdown of liver tissue re￾constitution caused by excessive liver regeneration
is considered to be the major cause of the rise of portal
pressure, tissue (sinusoidal) congestion, and hepato￾cellular necrosis. Therefore, it is thought that liver re￾generation needs to be adjusted (slowed-down) as a
new concept in overcoming a small-for-size-graft. We
have also reported the usefulness of geranylgerany￾lacetone (GGA), which successfully induced the heat
shock protein 70, on the hepatic insufficiency after mas￾sive hepatectomy in rats (28), and such a heat shock
protein inducer may become a new treatment strategy
for the small-for-size graft.
b) Large-for-size graft
When a graft size is conversely toolargefora recipient
such as a newborn infant, the graft necrosis occurred
due to insufficient blood inflow into the graft. In
the case of the large-for-graft over 5% of GRWR, the
graft survival was reported to be worsened due to in￾creased incidence of portal vein thrombosis and an
acute cellular rejection by Kiuchi and others (8). Ka￾The Journal of Medical Investigation Vol. 52 February 2005 ２５

sahara and others (29) reported obtaining good results
using a monosegment graft, when GRWR of a graft
exceeds 4.0%.
2. ABO blood-type incompatible transplantation
An ABO blood-type incompatible LTx is known to
often need a re-transplant because of the critical com￾plications causing rejection, and, is generally considered
to be a contraindication except for urgent cases even
in the LTxfrom deceased donors. However, in the LDLT
donor, candidates are restricted to relatives, therefore,
the problem of an ABO blood-type incompatible LTx
is unavoidable. Because of a serious rejection mainly
caused by a pre-existing antibody to a donor blood type
antigen, the hepatic insufficiency due to rapid liver ne￾crosis is often seen by less than 1 month after LDLT,
and the intractable bile duct damage after 3 months
is concurred when the graft overcomes hepatic necro￾sis. (30-32) In the case of a baby of less than one year
of age by whom the immunity function is not estab￾lished, the result equivalent to the blood-type compat￾ible LTx is acquired. On the other hand, in adult cases,
the above-mentioned complications significantly reduce
the postoperative probability of survival. According
to Egawa and others (33), the overall 5-year survival
rate in the ABO blood-type incompatible LDLT was
59%, and was significantly low compared with blood￾type compatible LDLT. When this was restricted to
adults of 16 years of age or more, the 5-year survival rate
was much poorer (22%). Recently, Tanabe and others
(34) reported that an intraportal infusion therapy using
triple drugs of prostaglandin E1, gabexate mesilate,
and steroids was useful to prevent serious complications
in the blood-type incompatible LDLT. A big possibility
opened up in terms of the improvement in results of
an blood-type incompatible LTx. After the introduction
of a portal infusion technique, the overall result in the
blood-type compatible LDLT improved up to 51.2% of
the 5-year survival rate. Furthermore, the Kyoto Uni￾versity group has started a hepatic artery infusion tech￾nique and reported further improvement in results (35).
They emphasized the following points regarding the
merits of using the hepatic artery : 1) direct effect of
medication is expected in a thin artery level, 2) main
feeder of bile ducts, 3) improvement of drug-distribution
due to imbalanced distribution in portal blood flow.
Improvement in the results by accumulation of future
cases is expected.
3. LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma
A liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment in
which not only HCC but the liver cirrhosis of the high
cancerous state is cured. Until the start of the 1990s,
the results of LTx was very poor(36-38), since the LTx
in the West was also positively enforced in advanced
HCC. Therefore, HCC has been a contraindication of

demonstrated the congestive area coincident to the area in 3D-CT.

LTx due to the serious organ shortage late in the 1980s.
Mazzaferro and others (39) reported in 1996 a good
(acceptable) result of HCC patients (4-year survival
rate of 75% and 4-year disease free survival rate of 83%),
which is equivalent to the results in other non-HCC
patients. Their patient’s selection criteria are as follows :
no extrahepatic metastasis, no macroscopic vascular
invasion, single tumor nodule 5 cm or less in diameter
or tumor nodule 3 or less in number and 3 cm or less
in diameter. This patient selection criteria is called the
Milan standard, it is set to a gold standard of the trans￾plant indication for HCC. Recently, UNOS (United Net￾work for Organ Sharing) changed its policy to reduce
the number of HCC patients that drop-out from the
waiting list due to HCC progression during the waiting
time, in which HCC patients are given a higherMELD
(Model of End-stage Liver Disease) score than other
liver diseases. As a result, the opportunity for a HCC
patient to receive an LTx increases (40).
Also in Japan, a LDLT is carried out positively on
HCC patients, and the number of LDLT for HCC was
225 cases by the end of 2002. Since medical insurance
covered the LDLT for cirrhotic patients with HCC, which
meets the Milan standard, from January 2004, therefore,
the LDLT becomes an important option for HCC treat￾ment. At almost all institutions in Japan, the diameter
of HCC and the number of HCC nodules are not in￾cluded in the institutional criteria of LDLT to HCC.
Furthermore, a LDLT may produce the possibility
of the further expansion of indication to HCC. Because
the LDLT can be made on the basis of both recipient’s
and donor’s sufficient understanding of the validity
and limit of LDLT, and a fair number of non-recurred
survivors are also proven to exist in the cases of devia￾tion from the Milan standard. Furthermore, the LDLT
is a special type of transplant, which is performed from
a specific donor to a specific recipient. The UCSF (Uni￾versity of California, San Francisco) standard to which
the Milan standard was actually expanded is advocated
by Yao and others (41) in 2001. Their criteria are as
follows : single nodule 6.5 cm or less in diameter, or 3
or less in number and 4.5 cm or less in diameter (8 cm
or less in the sum of total maximum diameters of the
nodules). They reported a good result of probability
of survival as 90% and 75.2% for one year and five years,
respectively, in those who satisfied their criteria.
We also reported even those with the Milan stan￾dard deviation can be expected to have a good prog￾nosis if their tumor nodule is 5 cm or less in diameter
and their des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin value is
less than 300 mAU/ml (42). It is considered that this
useful marker, which serves as an index of the recur￾rence and the expansion of indication to HCC patients,
is necessary. Furthermore, such apparent risk factors
for a recurrence of HCC as 1) the diameter of HCC,
2) the presence of vascular invasion, and 3) the poorly
differentiated histological type. Therefore, in the near
future, a needle biopsy of HCC should be taken into
consideration to clarify the histological type and degree
of malignancy of HCC using molecular biological tech￾niques in each patient. Regarding the expansion of the
indication of LDLT to HCC, a new standard based on
the above-mentioned facts should be made in the near
future.
4) Relapse of hepatitis C
Liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is now one of the
most frequent indications for LTx, occupying 30-50%
of all European and American liver transplant patients.
While the relapse of hepatitis B can be completely con￾trolled by lamivudine and the anti-hepatitis B virus im￾munoglobulin (HBIG), the relapse of hepatitis C occurs
virologically in about 100% of recipients and histologi￾cally in about 20% of cases to advance to liver cirrhosis
five years after LTx (43, 44). Furthermore, some patients
exhibit a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis as a seri￾ous type of hepatitis called fibrosing cholestatic hepa￾titis, which results in graft loss (45). The risk of graft loss
due to a hepatitis C relapse has increased in recent
years with an increase in the number of cases, and lead￾ing to a decline in the probability of survival is a big prob￾lem (46). Although an interferon was used as a method
of preventing hepatitis C recurrence before, and normali￾zation (biochemical effect) of alanine aminotransferase
value is obtained, but the virological effect on hepatitis
C is seldom seen (47). The anti-virus treatment of a com￾bination of interferon and ribavirin results in a continu￾ous virological response of 40% or more in patients (48,
49). However, while it is expected as an effective cure,
the side effects (hemolytic anemia, etc.) are also strong,
and there are also many patients dropping-outfrom the
treatment regimen. Pegylated-interferon having the
same anti-viral effects and few adverse effects, which
is administered only once a week, is more attractive
than conventional interferon, and recently the expectation
is growing in the combined use of treatment with riv￾abirin. Moreover, a recent report raised the following
risk factors for a hepatitis C relapse : short-term use
of steroids, an elderly donor’s age, the use of azathiopu￾rine, steroids and use of purine-metabolic antagonist
of mycophenolate mofetil (50).Cyclosporine A, one
of the calcineurin inhibitors, was recently reported to
suppress the viral replication of the hepatitis C virus
(51). The prevention of hepatitis C is a growing issue

in LDLT.
5) Marginal donors
In order to improve the results in adult-to-adult LDLT,
a right lobe graft, approximately two thirds of the liver,
was introduced and is now frequently used, instead
of a left lobe graft or a left lateral segment graft in chi
recipients. Recently, a mortality of the living donor was
reported in the West (52-55). Furthermore, in Japan,
in proportion to an increase of a right lobe graft, donor’s
complications have increased due to the small residual
liver volume in donors. A donor’s death was finally re￾ported in Japan May 2003(5). Now, the donor’s safety
is again a top priority. From the viewpoint of both the
donor’s safety and the recipient’s outcome, the interests
in marginal donors are rapidly increasing. The selection
standard and evaluation basis of marginal donors are
herein discussed.
a) Fatty liver
A fatty liver is known to be unsuitable as a transplant
graft, which has been pointed out from experiences
of LTxfrom deceased donors. During a cold preservation
of the fatty liver graft, the fusion and expansion of fats
is made to press sinusoids and hepatocytes, leading
to the circulation disturbance in the sinusoids ad graft
injury (56). Since such a cold preservation period can
be minimized in a LDLT, the graft with a certain degree
of fatty infiltration is usable. However, there are little
clear parameters to demonstrate the limits of the fatty
liver. We previously reported that in the LDLT the fatty
liver was acceptable to the moderate grade of macrove￾sicular steatosis (20 to 50% of macrovesicular steatosis)
(57). However, our recent research showed that the
breakdown of sinusoidal reconstitution occurs in the
liver regeneration process of a fatty liver(58), therefore,
the fatty liver donor should be avoided in the case of
the small-for-size graft. In such a case, since a LDLT
is a scheduled operation, diet control and/or daily ex￾ercise are recommended before an operation to improve
the degree of fatty liver. Moreover, NASH (non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis) has attracted attention because of the
first donor’s death in Japan in 2003. Especially, in the
case of metabolic syndrome exhibiting the following
symptoms and signs of high blood pressure, hyper￾lipidemia, diabetes, and obesity, the NASH should be
ruled out using an ultrasonography and abdominal CT,
furthermore and sometimes liver biopsy.
b) Age
There are many institutions, which specify the maxi￾mum living-donor’s age to be 65 years old for the LDLT.
An advanced age donor’s problem in LDLT is firstly
the increase in a risk of hepatectomy. Due to improve￾ments in surgical techniques and the perioperative man￾agement, the rate of postoperative complications is low
(nearly zero) compared with overseas. However, since
the donor’s hepatectomy is an operation conducted
on a healthy donor, in order to avoid postoperative
complications, an evaluation of the whole body state
(operability) or estimation of residual liver volume be￾fore an operation takes precedence. Secondly, it is an
increase in the risk to the recipient due to a reduced
functional reserve of the transplant graft based on an
advanced age. It is thought that elderly people’s liver
function is greatly influenced by the ischemia and reper￾fusion injury compared to young livers, although it
seems practically equal compared with a young liver.
For this reason, when a transplant graft is small-for￾size, an aged liver graft should be avoided. Technetium￾99m-galactosyl-human serum albumin (GSA) scintig￾raphy, which expresses the binding ability of asialo￾glycoprotein of the liver, was suggested to be useful
in the evaluation of potential graft quality in LDLT(59).
6) Freedom from immunosuppressants
The immunosuppression after a liver transplantation
is in principle based on the combination of a calcineurin
inhibitor such as cyclosporine A and taclorimus, and
steroids. Recent trends in immunosuppression after
LTx is an early cessation of steroids and dose-reduction
of calcinneurin inhibitors to decrease the incidence
of adverse effects. A big theme in immunosuppression
after LDLT is the complete freedom from the immuno￾suppression. The Kyoto University group advocated
the following conditions to reduce or stop immuno￾suppression : 1) 2 years or more passed after LDLT;
2) normal liver function, 3) no history of acute cellular
rejection within one year ; and 4) no evidence of pro￾gressive bile duct damage in a liver biopsy specimen.
They succeeded in creating operational immune tol￾erance in 35 children out of 67(10th ILTS). A future aim
is an operational immune tolerance in adult recipients.
IN CONCLUSION
In this article we outlined the historical background
of a LDLT, and its present status andfuture perspective.
In the present time, beyond all doubt, a LDLT is an
important treatment option for end-stage liver diseases
in Japan, where a LTx form deceased donors has not
been yet accepted. However, the LDLT is a medical
treatment with a relatively short history, and there are
The Journal of Medical Investigation Vol. 52 February 2005 ２９

also many problems to be solved. Now in Japan, viral
liver cirrhosis and HCC within the Milan criteria has
been covered by medical insurance from January 2004.
The number of LDLT is expected to increase from now
on. Under these circumstances, although an improve￾ment in the results of LDLT is the aim, the donor’s safety
must be a priority. Obviously critical complications and
accidental death must be avoided by only operating
on healthy patients. Anyway, from now on it is expected
that there will be an increase in the number of LTx from
deceased donors which currently amounts to about
several cases per year.
