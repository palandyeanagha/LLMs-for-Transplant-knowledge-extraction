Abstract
Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a devastating complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), characterized by marked
inflammation and severe fibrosis of the peritoneum, and associated with high morbidity and mortality. EPS can occur years
after termination of PD and, in severe cases, leads to intestinal obstruction and ileus requiring surgical intervention. Despite
ongoing research, the pathogenesis of EPS remains unclear. We performed a global transcriptome analysis of peritoneal
tissue specimens from EPS patients, PD patients without EPS, and uremic patients without history of PD or EPS (Uremic).
Unsupervised and supervised bioinformatics analysis revealed distinct transcriptional patterns that discriminated these
three clinical groups. The analysis identified a signature of 219 genes expressed differentially in EPS as compared to PD and
Uremic groups. Canonical pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed enrichment in several pathways,
including antigen presentation, dendritic cell maturation, B cell development, chemokine signaling and humoral and
cellular immunity (P value,0.05). Further interactive network analysis depicted effects of EPS-associated genes on networks
linked to inflammation, immunological response, and cell proliferation. Gene expression changes were confirmed by qRT￾PCR for a subset of the differentially expressed genes. EPS patient tissues exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding
sulfatase1, thrombospondin 1, fibronectin 1 and alpha smooth muscle actin, among many others, while in EPS and PD
tissues mRNAs encoding leptin and retinol-binding protein 4 were markedly down-regulated, compared to Uremic group
patients. Immunolocalization of Collagen 1 alpha 1 revealed that Col1a1 protein was predominantly expressed in the
submesothelial compact zone of EPS patient peritoneal samples, whereas PD patient peritoneal samples exhibited
homogenous Col1a1 staining throughout the tissue samples. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that
encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is a distinct pathological process from the simple peritoneal fibrosis that accompanies all
PD treatment.

Introduction
Renal replacement therapy is currently restricted to renal
transplantation, hemodialysis (HD), and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
Peritoneal dialysis constitutes ,10% of current renal replacement
therapy in the US and in much of Europe, but up to 80% in
Mexico and Taiwan [1]. However, reimbursement changes
expected to accompany health care reform in the US will promote
renewed interest in and increased use of PD.
Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a rare but dangerous
complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Mortality rates as high as
57% [2,3] have been reduced at centers specializing in the medical
and surgical treatment of EPS, even in late stage disease
characterized by severe intestinal obstruction [3,4,5]. Although
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56389

sporadic idiopathic EPS has been reported [6,7,8], prior duration
of PD remains the most important risk factor identified to date
[2,9]. EPS epidemiology has been complicated by regional
differences in PD use and in reported EPS incidence, likely
exacerbated by non-uniform diagnostic criteria. EPS rates among
7000 patients from Australia and New Zealand were 0.3% after 3
years on PD, 0.8% after 5 years, and 3.9% after 8 years [9], but
8.1% of UK patients treated with PD for 5 years developed EPS
[10]. In a Japanese cohort of PD patients with overall EPS
incidence of 2.5%, EPS was diagnosed in 17–70% of patients with
PD duration .15 years [11,12,13]. 72% of EPS is recognized only
after discontinuation of PD due to ultrafiltration failure, switch to
hemodialysis, or transplantation [9]. Among transplanted PD
patients in the Dutch multicenter EPS study, EPS was the fourth
most common cause of death after infection, cardiovascular
disease, and malignancy [14].
The pathogenesis of EPS remains incompletely understood.
Simple peritoneal fibrosis accompanies nearly all PD treatment,
resulting in gradual impairment of ultrafiltration that can
necessitate transition to HD [15]. Risk factors and signaling
pathway abnormalities distinguishing the malignant fibrotic
process of EPS from simple peritoneal fibrosis are poorly defined.
The current two-hit model envisions as a first hit the long-term
exposure to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in peritoneal
dialysate [16,17], leading to increased expression of profibrotic
factors such as transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) and of
angiogenic mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF). In addition, declining numbers of pro-fibrinolytic mast
cells promote enhanced fibrin deposition [18]. A contributing role
has also been proposed for the turbulent fluid shear stress intrinsic
to the process of PD [19,20]. The second hit remains unknown,
but may be a clinically obvious or occult inflammatory or ischemic
stimulus. Peritoneal mesothelial cells are believed to undergo
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading in EPS to
complete mesothelial denudation that accompanies the severe
fibrosis [21,22]. However, the high rates of EPS among patients
treated with PD over lengthy periods also suggest an alternate
hypothesis. EPS may instead represent the natural evolution of
PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis, influenced by patient-specific
risk modifier gene profiles that determine the kinetics of
progression from simple fibrosis to EPS.
The absence of blood tests specific for EPS requires diagnosis
based on clinical presentation, radiologic and histologic findings
[2]. The clinical presentation of EPS is characterized by varied
and nonspecific symptoms, including bowel obstruction, loss of
appetite, fever, nausea and vomiting, ascites, constipation,
diarrhea and weight loss. The diagnosis of EPS is most commonly
made by CT scan, but the radiological picture can be nonspecific
[23]. Diagnosis also can be made by peritoneoscopy or laparot￾omy, classically revealing abdominal cocooning (bands or layers of
fibrotic tissue surrounding and constricting bowel loops), some￾times accompanied by a fibrotic ‘‘sugar coating’’ appearance.
Histologically, EPS peritoneal tissues often contain myofibroblast￾like cells expressing smooth muscle actin-1 and podoplanin [22].
Braun et al. have recently proposed additional novel histological
criteria for the diagnosis of EPS, including mesothelial denudation,
fibrin deposits, and presence of fibroblast-like cells [24].
Non-surgical therapeutic options for EPS are few, and
randomized controlled trials non-existent [12]. Glucocorticoids
have been used, especially in settings of marked inflammation
[12,25,26,27]. Clinical responses to azathioprine or mycopheno￾late have been reported [28], but the increased post-transplant
prevalence of EPS suggests possible deleterious, profibrotic actions
of calcineurin inhibitors [29]. Anecdotal reports of beneficial
treatment with tamoxifen have been attributed to inhibition of
profibrotic TGF-b [30,31]. Inhibitors of the renin angiotensin
aldosterone system (RAAS), widely used in PD patients and
including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), have been proposed to deter
development of EPS in PD patients [32]. Indeed, RAAS inhibition
in rat models has reduced angiogenesis and peritoneal thickening
[32], and retarded or reduced progression from simple fibrosis to a
condition resembling EPS [33]. However, severe EPS cases
characterized by enteral obstruction or ileus usually require urgent
surgical enterolysis and debridement. Although the outcomes of
acute surgical intervention are often favorable, EPS recurs in up to
23% of these post-surgical patients [12,34].
Models of peritoneal fibrosis in rats and mice [35] have been
generated by peritoneal insertion of foreign bodies [36], by
peritoneal instillation of peritoneal dialysate containing glucose
oxidation products for periods up to 3 weeks [37], by peritoneal
instillation of inflammatory agents such as chlorhexidine gluconate
[38], and by adenovirus-driven overexpression of TGF-b1 [39].
These models have offered opportunities for unbiased examina￾tions of changes in global gene expression [36,37,38] that might
shed light on the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis. However the
relationships between these short-term rodent models and the
human conditions of PD-associated slowly progressive peritoneal
fibrosis or the more serious and aggressive EPS remain unclear.
Therefore, we have performed a pilot study to compare
transcriptomes of fresh-frozen peritoneal biopsy samples from
EPS patients with those of PD patients without EPS, and with
those of uremic patients (Uremic) prior to initiation of dialysis. We
employed systems biology and interactive network analyses to
identify pathways and interactive networks enriched with EPS￾dysregulated genes, to establish the feasibility of using this
approach to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms of EPS
development in PD patients. This pilot study lays an empiric
foundation for future investigations to understand biological
mechanisms of EPS and to identify novel prognostic and
therapeutic biomarkers.
Methods
Sample accrual
All samples were obtained from the peritoneal biopsy registry at
Robert-Bosch Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany. Human peritoneal
tissue, blood and peritoneal dialysate was collected at time of
surgery at Robert-Bosch Hospital. Written informed consent was
obtained from Patients according to an approved protocol (#322/
2009BO1, Ethik-Kommission, Eberhard-Karls-Universita¨t Tbin￾gen, Germany). The approved protocol included a patient
information sheet explaining the purpose of the study and the
envisioned use of the tissue specimen. All patients agreeing to
participate in the study signed, in the presence of an authorized
clinical investigator, a detailed written consent form previously
approved by the ‘‘Ethik-Kommission’’ of Eberhard-Karls-Uni￾versita¨t Tbingen, Germany. Patients were provided one day
during which to reconsider their written consent. Surgeries
included implantation or reimplantation of peritoneal dialysis
(PD) catheters or, for EPS patients, enterolyses or peritonectomies.
The diagnosis of EPS was based on clinical and radiological
findings and on histological criteria that included fibrosis,
fibroblast-like cells, exudation, cellularity and its variability, vessel
density and its variability, acute or chronic inflammation,
hemorrhage, mesothelial hyperplasia, fibrin deposits, presence of
vasculopathy, mesothelial denudation, presence of acellular areas,
presence of iron and/or calcium deposits, and osseous metaplasia

[23,25,40]. Shortly after excision, tissue samples were washed in
0.9% saline solution, placed in RNAlater (Ambion, Woodlands,
TX) for 12 hours at room temperature, then stored at 280uC.
Clinical and laboratory data were recorded for all patients.
Clinical data included peritoneal transporter status, peritoneal
dialysis efficiency, and number of peritonitis episodes.
RNA isolation from fresh-frozen (FF) tissue
RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen tissues using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Frozen tissue samples were homoge￾nized in 1 ml Trizol reagent using a rotor-stator homogenizer
(Tissue Tearor, BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) for 1 minute.
After chloroform extraction of the homogenate, the aqueous
RNA-containing supernatant was twice ethanol-precipitated and
resuspended in nuclease-free water. RNA concentration was
measured by UV spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000,
NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). RNA integrity was
assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA).
cDNA synthesis
Tissue RNA samples were DNAse-treated (DNA-free kit,
Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, Foster City, CA), and 250 ng
total RNA from each specimen was reverse-transcribed using the
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems) for 10 min at 25uC, 120 min at 37uC, and 5 min at
85uC in a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems). Resultant cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) for individual gene expression assays
qRT-PCR was performed in duplicate with TaqMan gene
expression kits and TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (2x)
using the ‘‘fast protocol’’ performed on the 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems) in bar-coded MicroAmp 96-
well plates (Applied Biosystems), per manufacturer’s instructions.
The gene products analyzed included Thrombospondin 1
(THBS1), Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), Leptin (LEP),
Retinol-Binding Protein 4 (RBP4), Runt-Related Transcription
Factor 2 (RUNX2), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1),
a Smooth Muscle Actin (ACTA2), Fibronectin 1 (FN1), Collagen
1a1 (Col1a1), and Sulfatase 1 (SULF1). b-actin (ACTB) was used
as an endogenous control.
DNA microarrays
Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the
Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGen Technologies, San Carlos,
CA). cDNA samples were cleaved and 39-biotinylated using the
Encore Biotin Module (NuGen Technologies, San Carlos, CA),
yielding biotinylated single-stranded cDNA probes of 50–100 nt in
length. The probe mix was hybridized with the GeneChip Human
Genome HT U133 Plus PM Array plate (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA), presenting .54,000 target probe sets representing 47,000
transcripts encoding .33,000 well characterized human genes.
Microarray analysis was conducted by the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center Genomics and Proteomics Center according to
standard Affymetrix protocol, using a high throughput hybridiza￾tion and scanning system. The quality of hybridized chips was
assessed using Affymetrix guidelines based on PM mean, 39 to 59
ratios for beta-actin and GAPDH, and values for spike-in control
transcripts. We also monitored sample reproducibility by chip- to￾chip correlation and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) methods for
replicate arrays using the bioconductor package, arrayQuality￾Metrics [41]. All high quality arrays were included for unsuper￾vised and supervised bioinformatics analysis.
To obtain signal values, chips were further analyzed using the
Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method in R using Bioconduc￾tor and associated packages. RMA performed background
adjustment, quantile normalization and final summarization of
11 oligonucleotides per transcript using the median polish
algorithm [42]. Unsupervised analysis was performed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which projects multivariate
data objects onto a lower dimensional space while retaining as
much of the original variance as possible [43,44]. Before PCA,
transcripts were filtered to include only those with absolute
expression $10 in at least 10% of samples. When comparing two
groups of samples to identify genes enriched in a given phenotype,
i.e. enriched in Uremic vs. both EPS and PD, differentially
expressed genes were defined as those with LCB.2, serving as a
stringent estimate of the FC [45]. (LCB is defined as the 90%
Lower Confidence Bound of the fold change (FC) between the two
groups, providing 90% confidence that the actual FC exceeds the
threshold LCB).

PD as compared to Uremic, was by self-organizing map (SOM)
analysis of the differentially expressed genes. We performed SOM
clustering on transcript expression values using Pearson correla￾tion coefficient-based distance metrics and a target of 40 groups.
SOM allowed grouping of gene expression patterns into an
imposed structure in which adjacent clusters are related, thereby
identifying sets of genes that follow common expression patterns
(transcription signatures) across different conditions [45,46].
Pathways and interactive network analysis
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA 7.0, Ingenuity Systems, Inc.,
Redwood City, CA) was used to identify pathways and interaction
networks significantly affected by genes with expression changes
specifically associated with EPS or with both EPS and PD. The
knowledge base of this software consists of functions, pathways and
network models derived by systematic exploration of the peer￾reviewed scientific literature. IPA analysis calculates a P-value for
each pathway according to the fit of user data to the IPA database,
using a one-tailed Fisher exact test (http//www.ingenuity.com).
Pathways with multiple test-corrected P-values,0.05 were con￾sidered significantly affected.
An IPA score [(2log(P value)].2 indicates a probability .99%
that the affected network was not generated at random, but reflects
statistically (and biologically) meaningful relationships among a set
of genes with specifically altered expression. The ability to rank
networks based on relevance to the queried data sets allows
network prioritization according to highest predicted impact on
the disease process.
Immunohistochemistry
Deparaffinized, rehydrated tissue sections were incubated in
Peroxidase Blocking Solution (S 2023, DAKO, Hamburg,
Germany). Immunostaining was performed with a TechMate
500 Plus (DAKO), using a dextran-coated peroxidase-coupled
polymer system (Dako REALTM EnVisionTM Detection Kit,
Peroxidase/DAB+, Rabbit/Mouse, K 5007, DAKO). The
primary antibody was rabbit monoclonal anti-human collagen 1
a 1 (AB292, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) diluted 1:100 in DAKO S
2022 diluent. Skin tissue from a human non-diabetic leg served as
a positive tissue control. Omission of primary antibody served as
negative control. Adjacent tissue sections were stained with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).
Semiquantitative analysis of Collagen 1 a 1 immunostaining
was performed within defined areas from 0–100 mm and from
100–200 mm inward from the mesothelial tissue edges towards the
adventitia, using ImageJ 1.46 (NIH). Color images recorded by an
Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP71
camera were converted to 32-bit black and white. Immunostaining
detection threshold was zeroed at background staining intensity,
and ranged from 0–255 arbitrary units. Measurements were
recorded at three or more discreet locations within each specimen.
Scaled intensity values in the region 0–100 mm from the
mesothelial edge were divided by the intensity values in the
adjacent region 100–200 mm from the edge. The mean intensity
ratios for each group were normalized to that of the Uremic
group, to which was assigned a relative intensity ratio value of 1.0.

component with highest variance (42.2%) is on the X-axis separating Uremic and PD from EPS samples. The second highest (26.4%) is on the Y-axis
depicting maximum variation between PD and Uremic samples. The Uremic, PD and EPS samples formed three separate clusters on the PCA plot.

Statistical Analysis
Clinical data and laboratory values were compared by ANOVA
(Sigmaplot 11.0, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Differences
in results were considered statistically significant for P,0.05.
Results
Patient characteristics
Tissue samples were available from 8 patients: 4 with
encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS, 2 males and 2 females,
of mean age 60.8 yrs and mean PD duration 74634 months), 2
chronic peritoneal dialysis patients (PD, 1 male and 1 female, of
mean age 68.5 yrs and mean PD duration 23 months), and 2 male
Uremic patients of mean age 56.5 yrs, as yet undialyzed (Table 1,
Table S1). Uremic patients had an estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR),15 mL/min/1,73 m2 body surface area. Residual
renal function (urine output, RRF) was 2756246 mL in the EPS
group, 440 mL for the PD group, and 2000 mL in the Uremic
group (p,0.01 Uremic vs. both groups). Additional clinical
characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and (for individual
patients) Tables S2a and S2b. Serum chemistries are presented in
Table S1.
DNA microarray analysis - unsupervised analysis
Unsupervised analysis was performed on ,11,500 transcripts
after preprocessing and normalization of high quality DNA
expression data. By principal component analysis, we demonstrat￾ed that samples separated according to EPS status along primary
component (PC) 1, which accounted for 42.2% of the variation
between samples. The analysis revealed three distinct clusters of
gene expression by principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 1),
consistent with the three clinical groups.
Identification of genes significantly dysregulated only
with EPS or both EPS and PD
Supervised analysis applying a 90% lower confidence bound of
the fold change (LCB of FC), and expressed as corrected fold￾change .2.0, revealed 531 genes differentially expressed between
EPS and PD groups, 557 genes differentially expressed between
EPS and Uremic groups, and 816 genes differentially expressed
between PD and Uremic groups (Figure 2A). Tables S2, S3, S4
present the 50 genes most highly differentially expressed in
pairwise comparisons of the three clinical groups. The group of
genes upregulated in EPS compared to PD is dominated by genes
involved in immunological processes (e.g. MHC class II and
associated proteins). The comparison of EPS to the Uremic group
featured upregulation of genes encoding collagens and other
matrix proteins, and downregulation of lipid metabolism genes
such as glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (,20-fold). In con￾trast, comparison of PD with Uremic reveals significant upregula￾tion of lipid metabolism genes (20-fold increased glycerol-3-
phosphate acyltransferase) and downregulation of matrix metab￾olism genes, including integrins and collagens.
The Venn diagram of Figure 2A shows that 228 transcripts are
differentially expressed in both the comparisons between EPS and
the Uremic control group and between PD and Uremic groups,
and these represent a candidate transcription signature for
peritoneal fibrosis. The Venn diagram also depicts a set of 641
transcripts that are differentially expressed uniquely in EPS as
compared to PD or Uremic, and so might include candidate genes
linked to the pathological progression from uremic changes,
through the simple peritoneal fibrosis of PD, and on to EPS.
When using gene clustering and self-organizing maps (SOM) to
detect groups of differentially expressed genes with similar
expression patterns, we arbitrarily drew 40 separate maps
according to Pearson correlation coefficient-based distance metrics
(Figure S1). Evaluation of the maps revealed groups of similarly
structured expression patterns, allowing selective merger of
patterns depicting specific dysregulation in EPS vs. both PD and

Uremic, or dysregulation in both EPS and PD as compared to
Uremic. The analysis identified a set of 316 transcripts differen￾tially expressed in both EPS and PD as compared to Uremic
(fibrosis signature) (Figure 2B). This analysis also identified another
set of 219 transcripts specifically differentially expressed in EPS vs.
PD as well as in EPS vs. Uremic (EPS Signature) (Figure 2C).
Canonical pathways analysis of EPS and Disease
Signatures
We performed canonical pathways enrichment analysis (IPA
7.0) to gain further insight into the functional pathways associated
with genes dysregulated only in EPS (EPS signature), and with
those dysregulated in both EPS and PD (Disease signature). EPS￾associated genes were significantly over-represented (P val￾ue,0.05) in pathways related to immune response, inflammation
and cytoskeleton signaling, including ‘‘antigen presentation’’, ‘‘Dendritic
cell maturation’’, ‘‘B cell development’’, ‘‘complement system’’, ‘‘chemokine
signaling’’ and ‘‘humoral and cellular immunity’’ (Figure 3A). Most of the
genes in these pathways were upregulated in EPS, suggesting
enhanced activity of innate immune and inflammation pathways.
Pathway analysis of the genes differentially expressed in both the
EPS vs. Uremic and the PD vs. Uremic comparisons showed
significant association with pathways involved in cell signaling,
immune response and metabolism, including ‘‘Oxidative Phosphor￾ylation’’, ’’Mitochondrial Dysfunction’’, ‘‘Oncostatin M-’’, ‘‘ILK-’’,
‘‘CXCR4-’’ and ‘‘PDGF -’’ signaling (Figure 3B).
EPS impacts critical molecules and networks linked to
inflammation, immunological response, and cell
proliferation
To integrate a functional view of critical regulatory molecules
associated with EPS, we performed interactive network analysis on
the 228 genes specifically dysregulated in EPS tissue specimens
(Figure 2C). The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis tool was applied to
generate interaction networks based on known functional interac￾tions such as protein-protein interactions or gene regulation
interactions (Figure 4). The analysis identified 8 different networks
that were significantly affected in EPS with a score .20 (2log 10
[Fisher’s Exact Test]). Networks of related function were merged
to generate more comprehensive networks. Three different
networks related to cell assembly and organization and connective
tissue and skeletal muscle tissue disorders were merged to generate
an integrated view of cell cycle-related dysregulation in EPS tissue
(Figure 4A), featuring the NF-kB, collagen, and ERK1/2 genes as
major critical regulatory nodes. Another EPS-associated compre￾hensive network merging subnetworks linked to cell growth and
proliferation and to carbohydrate metabolism (as in gastrointes￾tinal and immunological diseases) features the PI3K, IFNc and
MAPK1 genes as major regulatory focus nodes. These regulatory
focus nodes are likely critical to network function, such that
therapeutic (or pathologic) alteration of expression of these genes
predicts perturbation of the entire network.
EPS and PD both impact critical molecules and networks
associated with inflammatory disease, metabolism, cell
motility, and cell signaling
To gain further insight into functional consequences of genes
that are altered both in both EPS and PD as compared to the
Uremic group, we again performed IPA interactive network
analysis, identifying 8 different networks significantly affected in
both EPS and PD compared to the Uremic control group with a
significance score .20. Three networks related to inflammatory
and immunological diseases were merged to identify critical
regulatory genes (Figure 5A). The resulting merged network
highlighted NFKB, JUN, SP1 as critical regulatory molecules. The
independent merged network in Figure 5B is enriched in genes
involved in lipid metabolism, cellular assembly and movement,
and cell death, and reveals the PI3K, AKT and TP53 genes as
major regulatory focus nodes.
qRT-PCR Validation of DNA array data
Selected cases of differential gene expression were validated by
qRT-PCR assays. b-actin was used as an endogenous ‘‘control’’
transcript. The data were analyzed using the 22DCT calculation,
and then normalized to the Uremic group, for which relative gene
expression = 1.0. The results of the DNA chip array are presented
as mean raw signal intensities. Col1a1 showed .20-fold upregula￾tion in EPS over Uremic and a 2.5-fold increase in gene expression
over PD as judged by qRT-PCR, while the DNA chip array
showed .5-fold transcript induction in EPS over Uremic and
,1.5-fold upregulation over PD (Figure 6). a-Smooth muscle actin
(ACTA2), Sulfatase 1 (SULF1) and Intracellular adhesion
molecule 1 (ICAM1) exhibited similar expression patterns (Figure
S2), with EPS showing the highest levels of transcript induction.
Fibronectin 1 (FN1) and Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) showed yet
greater upregulation in EPS compared to EPS and Uremic control
groups (Figure 6), whereas Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4)
(Figure 6) and Leptin (LEP) (Figure S3) were substantially
downregulated in both EPS and PD groups compared to the
Uremic control group (figure 6). The DNA array results generally
correlated well with the qRT-PCR data. However, whereas array
data indicated highest expression of Runt-related transcription
factor 2 (RUNX2) and Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in the
EPS group, qRT-PCR indicated highest expression in the PD
group (Figure S4).
Immunostaining for Collagen 1 a 1 (Col1a1)
To determine protein expression of Col1a1, one of the more
highly upregulated genes in EPS, we performed anti-Col1a1
immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embed￾ded tissue sections corresponding to the fresh frozen specimens
from which RNA was isolated. EPS and PD tissues showed
marked immunostaining for Col1a1, indicating fibrosis. In most of
the EPS and PD samples the mesothelium was not detectable. PD
sections were strongly and homogeneously stained with Col1a1
throughout the entire specimen. In contrast, EPS samples
exhibited pronounced Col1a1 immunostaining predominantly in
the area of the (most superficial) submesothelial zone. We

quantified the extent of the latter staining pattern by making
staining intensity measurements in the submesothelial zone (0–
100 mm) and the adjacent, deeper zone (100–200 mm from the
surface of the tissue block zone moving towards the adventitial
layer). The normalized submesothelial staining intensity of the 0–
100 mm zone relative to the deeper 100–200 mm zone was 7-fold
higher in the EPS group than in the PD or Uremic groups
(Figure 7). Similar zonal analyses with zone thicknesses of 200 and
or 500 mm yielded the same result.
Discussion
EPS is among the most serious complications of chronic PD.
Although PD duration seems to be a major risk factor,
spontaneous EPS has been reported, and the causes of EPS
remain obscure. The factors that govern progression from the
common PD-associated condition of simple peritoneal fibrosis to
the rare but aggressive condition of EPS are poorly understood.
The pilot study presented here is the first comparison of
transcriptomes of human peritoneal tissues taken from patients
with EPS, PD patients without EPS, and predialytic uremic
patients. The three groups show distinct gene expression patterns
that allow their separation by principal component and heat map
analyses. The results constitute proof-of-principle for a larger-scale
study that could generate hypotheses for future EPS research,
leading to more rigorous biochemical or cell biologic diagnostic
criteria for EPS, and to definition of prognostic markers.
Correlation of these and future transcriptome data with proteo￾mics studies from peritoneal tissue and fluid would add further
insight into EPS disease pathways and could improve early
diagnosis and prevention.
Patients and tissue samples
The samples examined in this study were the first fresh-frozen
tissue samples collected by the Peritoneal Biobank at the Robert￾Bosch Hospital in Stuttgart, Germany, as part of a comprehensive
database of tissues, serum, whole-blood and peritoneal effluent
samples from PD patients, PD patients with EPS, and control
patients without and with uremia. Collection of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded peritoneal tissue blocks had been initiated
previously. The early stage of fresh tissue collection is reflected in
the small sample sizes of the current study and the imperfect
clinical matching of specimens in terms of PD duration, number of
peritonitis episodes, Kt/V, systemic baseline inflammatory state,
and use of acidic dialysate likely containing glucose oxidation
products [47,48,49,50]. Consistent with their predialytic status,
patients of the Uremic control group exhibited higher values of
residual urine excretion, blood hemoglobin, serum creatinine,
BUN, and calcium than did PD patients (p,0.05 for BUN and
calcium) or EPS patients (Table 1).
The limited number and mass of patient samples available for
this pilot study also prevented uniformity of dominant tissue
histological features of the RNA source tissues within and among
clinical groups. Later studies might employ laser capture
microdissection to facilitate comparison of histologically similar
regions within and among groups.
Transcriptome patterns and pathways
Transcriptome results exhibited good inter-individual agree￾ment. Unsupervised analysis identified three distinct gene expres￾sion patterns consistent with the samples’ clinical groupings
(Figure 1). Several hundred genes were identified by a moderately
stringent criterion as differentially expressed in each pairwise
comparison (Figure 2A). Subsets of these genes predictably
differentiated the Uremic group from both EPS and PD groups
(Figure 2B). However, another subset served to differentiate EPS
from both PD and the Uremic group (Figure 2C).
The differentially expressed genes could be organized into
canonical pathways that distinguished EPS as a separate group
from both the PD and the Uremic groups (Figure 3A), and into
pathways that distinguished the Uremic control group from both
EPS and PD groups (Figure 3B). The pathways uniting genes
upregulated uniquely in EPS are dominated by pathways involved
in cellular and humoral defense, including those controlling
antigen presentation, dendritic cell maturation, phagocytic func￾tion, and leukocyte degranulation. The EPS-upregulated degran￾ulation product, lysozyme, is a component of renal amyloid, but
histological evidence of amyloid has not been observed in EPS.
Additional serological, immunocyte-related, and innate immune
response pathways are also regulated preferentially in EPS
(Figure 3A). These results are consistent with the reported
contribution of peritoneal complement activation to peritoneal
fibrin deposition and early peritoneal fibrosis in a murine model
[50,51]. They are likewise consistent with the reported local
proliferation of alternatively activated MQ2 macrophages without
macrophage recruitment from distant sites [52]. These macro￾phages can secrete proinflammatory mediators during episodes of
infectious peritonitis [53], associated with increased risk of EPS. In
addition, macrophages express the EPS-upregulated scavenger
receptor A (SRA/MSR1), previously associated with fibrotic
processes [54]. The elevation in EPS tissue of genes encoding
neurotropin receptors and their ligands GDNF, BDNF, neurotro￾phin-3 and MANF (not shown) is also consistent with increased
macrophage activation or function. Coincident upregulation of
matrix protease inhibitors such as TIMP1 and SERPINH1 and
proteases such as ADAM9 and MM2 is also apparent (not shown).
The pathways shared by EPS and PD groups that differentiate
them both from the Uremic group (Figure 3B) feature oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism and dysfunction, and a variety of cell
signaling pathways. PD is known to promote malnutrition and
excessive loss of free amino acids, essential fatty acids [55], and
albumin [56], leading to muscle wasting [57]. The downregulation
of leptin mRNA in peritoneal tissues from both EPS and PD
patients (Figure S2) may reflect malnourishment in chronic PD
patients, as serum leptin levels fall during long-term fasting [58]. In
contrast, elevated serum and dialysate leptin have been reported
during chronic PD [59,60]. Moreover, treatment of hyperacutely
uremic rats with high glucose PD solutions produced hyperlepti￾nemia, and acute exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to high-glucose
PD solution increased leptin mRNA levels [61,62]. The striking
downregulation of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) mRNA to
,10% of Uremic group levels in both PD and EPS groups has

been associated with lean body mass [63] and with ovarian cancer

with elevated serum RBP4. RBP4 has not been studied in
peritoneal dialysis patients.

exacerbated fibrotic processes underlying EPS. COL1a1 mRNA
showed the highest proportional increase in the EPS group
(Figure 6 and Table S3). Col1a1 is not only a major component of
fibrotic peritoneal tissue (Figure 6), but has also been reported as a
marker of peritoneal fibrocytes together with CD45/PTPRC [65],
another gene product upregulated in EPS (Table S2). Also
upregulated were matrix proteases and protease inhibitors, and
thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), activated through a NF-kB signaling
pathway which acts as one of the major regulatory nodes in the
presented networks [66]. THBS1 is involved in physiological tissue
repair and extracellular matrix remodeling as a regulator of TGF￾b-mediated fibrosis [67], and as a proinflammatory and profibrotic
factor in chronic kidney disease and kidney fibrosis [68]. Also
markedly upregulated was sulfatase 1 (SULF1) mRNA (Figure 6),
which like SULF2 modulates the sonic hedgehog (Shh), wingless
(Wnt), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways. The highly upregulated
Fibronectin 1 transcript (Figure 6) encodes a ubiquitously
expressed extracellular matrix protein involved in wound healing
[69,70] and is overexpressed in fibrotic tissues [71,72], induced in
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and implicated in glomerular and
interstitial renal fibrosis [73].
The myofibroblast marker a-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2)
mRNA was also upregulated (Figure S2). ACTA2 has been
implicated in TGF-b-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transi￾tion (EMT) in bronchial cells in a cellular model of asthma [74],
and in numerous other models of tissue fibrosis. EMT is believed
to play an important role in EPS, especially in postulated
mesothelial cell transformation into myofibroblasts [75]. One of
the important pathways through which EMT is induced is the
ERK1/2 pathway [76], another central regulatory node in the
EPS-related networks (Figure 4A). The transcription factor
TWIST, upregulated 5-fold in PD and 2.5-fold in EPS (not
shown), has been widely implicated as a driver of EMT, most
recently in a mouse model of peritoneal fibrosis [77]. Lysyl
oxidase, best known for its post-translational lysine hydroxylation
of collagen, was recently identified as a transcriptional activator of
TWIST and TWIST-mediated EMT [78]. Interestingly, expres￾sion of the closely related LOXL2 transcript was 4.2-fold higher in
the EPS group than in the PD group (Table S2). LOXL2
transcription can be increased by VEGF and by high glucose [79].
LOXL2 can deaminate Lys4 in histone H3 [80], but at least some
of its effects as an inhibitor of differentiation are independent of its
enzymatic activity [81].

Several transcriptome studies of rodent peritoneal fibrosis
models have recently appeared. Yokoi et al [38] suggested that
pleiotrophin plays an important role in both inflammation and
fibrosis following acute chlorhexidine gluconate-induced peritone￾al injury in mice. Pleiotrophin upregulation was not observed in
tissue from our EPS patients compared to chronic PD or Uremic
groups. However, observations of elevated procollagen, CCl5,
Cxcl16, and Adam12 in that mouse model [38] were also noted in
our human EPS specimens. Imai et al described a rat model in
which intraperitoneal instillation of high-dose glucose-degradation
products led to peritoneal fibrotic changes consistent with a role
for EMT in development of peritoneal fibrosis [37]. Le et al
induced peritoneal fibrosis in rats via foreign body insertion [36].
As in our observations with human tissue, they observed
upregulation of a-smooth muscle actin and other myofibroblast
markers, as well as overexpression of profibrotic agents such as
TGF-b and CTGF. However, interpretation of mechanistic
comparisons between animal models of induced peritoneal fibrosis
and PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis and EPS in humans remains
difficult.
Col1a1 IHC Immunohistochemistry
Histochemical expression of collagen I was compared to the
increased Col1a1 mRNA levels in EPS tissue. The increased
Col1a1 mRNA level in EPS tissue was not paralleled by higher
total Col1a1 polypeptide levels, as judged by immunostaining
intensity across entire fields of view. Although EPS tissue showed
greater Col1a1 expression than did Uremic group tissue, the
highest levels of Col1a1 immunostaining were observed in PD
tissues. In contrast to the homogeneous distribution of Col1a1
immunostaining across entire PD tissue sections, EPS samples
exhibited pronounced intensification of Col1a1 immunostaining in
the submesothelial compact zone (Figure 7). This pattern of higher
density of fibrous tissue and pronounced accumulation of collagen
1 a 1 protein was also noted in the peritoneal submesothelial
compact zone in rats after 4 weeks exposure to PD fluid [82].
Conclusion
Although EPS remains a poorly understood disease, we have
demonstrated a distinct transcriptional pattern of peritoneal tissue
from EPS patients that differed from those of PD patients and
predialytic uremic patients. The distinct transcriptional patterns of
EPS and PD tissues presented here are consistent with the
hypothesis that EPS constitutes a separate disease entity, possibly
requiring a ‘‘second hit’’, and not merely an exacerbation of the
simple peritoneal sclerosis believed present in all PD patients.
However, the data also are consistent with EPS representing a
malignant acceleration of PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis influ￾enced by patient-specific risk modifier genes and, possibly, by
transplant and/or immunosuppression therapy.
Although our small study does not point to a principal
pathogenic mechanism in EPS distinct from that of the simple
peritoneal fibrosis of chronic PD, the study does serve as proof-of￾principle for future array studies with peritoneal tissue from larger
groups of patients. Preliminary data (not shown) indicates that the
spectrum and abundance of mRNA isolated from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissues from the same patients studied in this
paper were very similar to those of mRNA isolated from fresh￾frozen tissue (correlation coefficient .0.91). This suggests the
reliability of transcriptome analysis applied to archived paraffin
blocks of tissues from EPS and PD patients, especially when
combined with laser capture microdissection for comparison of
histologically similar regions of tissue. Similar transcriptome
studies should be conducted with peritoneal dialysate fluid and
cell specimens, and with blood specimens, since accrual of samples
will be easier than for peritoneal tissue samples. Moreover,
definition of transcriptional signatures may prove to have value for
diagnostic monitoring and prognosis. Comprehensive analysis of
miRNAs will be important to include in these future studies, since
they (or their antagomirs) can be easily envisioned as intraperi￾toneal therapeutic agents.
