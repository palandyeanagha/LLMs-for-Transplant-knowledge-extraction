Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a multisystem disorder of individuals who carry mutations in tafazzin, a putative
phospholipid acyltransferase. We investigated the hypothesis that BTHS is caused by specific impairment of
the mitochondrial lipid metabolism. The fatty acid composition of all major mitochondrial phospholipids,
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and cardiolipin (CL), changed in lymphoblasts
from BTHS patients. These changes were most extensive in CL and least extensive in PE. The complementary
nature of the fatty acid alterations in CL and PC suggested that fatty acid transfer between these two lipids
was inhibited in BTHS. Fluorescence staining and electron microscopy showed abnormal proliferation of
mitochondria in BTHS lymphoblasts. The mitochondrial membrane potential, monitored with the fluorescence
probe JC-1, was reduced in BTHS lymphoblasts. However, mitochondrial ATP formation of permeabilized
lymphoblasts remained unaffected in BTHS. The data suggest that phospholipid abnormalities of BTHS
mitochondria led to partial uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and that lymphoblasts compensated for
this deficiency by expanding the mitochondrial compartment.

Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked disease
presenting with cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy,
neutropenia, and growth retardation.1–4 Mutations
that cause BTHS are located in the tafazzin gene,5
which belongs to a large superfamily of phospho￾lipid acyltransferases.6 The lipid etiology of BTHS
was confirmed when Vreken et al7 found aberrant
cardiolipin (CL) metabolism in BTHS fibroblasts.
CL is a dimeric phospholipid that is specific to
mitochondria and has a unique fatty acid pattern.8
The fatty acid pattern of CL is severely disturbed in
heart, skeletal muscle,9,10 platelets,9–11 and neutro￾phils of BTHS patients.12 The same phenomenon
was observed in tafazzin-deficient yeast.13,14 It
appears that tafazzin is required to generate mature
CL by remodeling its fatty acid pattern.15 In the
absence of functional tafazzin, CL is unable to form
certain molecular species (specific combinations of
fatty acids in a single molecule), the concentration
of CL is reduced, and there is accumulation of its
degradation product, monolyso-CL.9–15
BTHS is unique because it is the only cardiomyo￾pathy whose origin is found in phospholipid
metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism of
the disease has not been understood. In particular, it
has remained elusive how the phospholipid defect
relates to any of the established pathways to
cardiomyopathy, which involve either the contrac￾tile apparatus or the energy supply.16,17 The CL
changes suggest that mitochondria may be the
primary site of the lipid defect and that BTHS may
affect mitochondrial function. In this paper, we
tested this hypothesis in lymphoblasts from chil￾dren with BTHS. We studied phospholipid patterns
inside and outside of mitochondria and character￾ized mitochondrial properties related to oxidative
phosphorylation.
Materials and methods
Patients
The study was performed with lymphoblasts from
five patients with BTHS and five control subjects
(age 1–9 years). All patients were male. BTHS

caused protein deletion. They presented with
cardiomyopathy plus at least two of the noncardiac
symptoms of BTHS (neutropenia, growth retarda￾tion, skeletal muscle weakness, 3-methylglutaconic
aciduria). Control patients were individuals with
normal tafazzin genes who presented for work-up of
unrelated neurologic conditions. The human study
protocol was approved by institutional review
boards of Johns Hopkins University and New York
University Medical Center.
Lymphoblast Cultures and Isolation of Subcellular
Membranes
Lymphoblast cell lines were established by Epstein–
Barr virus transformation of leukocytes isolated
from whole blood using Ficoll–Hypaque gradients.
The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
in the presence of fetal bovine serum (10%),
penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin (50 mg/ml)
at 371C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. The serum was
heat-inactivated at 561C for 30 min prior to use.
Lymphoblasts were seeded at a density of 3  105
cells/ml and cultures were expanded every 2–3
days. Mitochondria were isolated from lympho￾blasts, growing at mid-log phase, at 41C according
to a published protocol.18 In short, 1–2  109 cells,
growing in mid-log phase, were harvested and their
wet weight was determined. Cells were resuspended
in chilled isolation buffer (210 mM mannitol, 70 mM
sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine
serum albumin, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) at a concen￾tration of 4 ml per gram wet weight. Digitonin (10%
w/v in DMSO) was slowly added to a final
concentration of 0.2–0.4 mg/ml until more than
90% of lymphoblasts were permeabilized. Permea￾bilization was determined by staining with trypan
blue. The digitonin incubation was terminated by
dilution with isolation buffer. Permeabilized cells
were collected by centrifugation and disrupted in a
tight-fitting glass–Teflon homogenizer. Cell debris
and nuclei were removed by three runs of 5-min
spins at 625 g. The final supernatant was spun at
10 000 g for 20 min, yielding the mitochondrial
pellet. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was
spun at 100 000 g for 1 h, yielding the microsomal
pellet. The membranes were re-suspended in buffer
and stored at 801C.
Fatty Acid Composition of Phospholipids
Lipids were extracted from whole lymphoblasts,
lymphoblast mitochondria, or microsomes accord￾ing to Bligh and Dyer.19 Extracted lipids were
separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromato￾graphy on silica gel 60, developed with chloroform–
methanol–water (65/25/4) in the first direction and
chloroform–acetone–methanol–acetic acid–water
(50/20/10/10/5) in the second direction. Lipids were
stained by brief exposure to iodine. The spots of
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanol￾amine (PE), and CL were marked and iodine was
blown off. The spots were scraped into reaction vials
for transmethylation, which was performed in the
presence of 0.5 M HCl/methanol at 901C for 12 h.
The reaction mixture was neutralized with saturated
NaHCO3 and extracted with n-hexane. Fatty acid
methyl esters were analyzed by isothermic (1851C)
gas chromatography, using a Shimadzu GC-17A
instrument equipped with a SP-2330 capillary
column (0.32 mm  30 m, 0.2 mm column film) and
a flame ionization detector.
Molecular Species of PC
PC was isolated from lymphoblasts by two-dimen￾sional thin-layer chromatography as described
above. It was extracted from silica gel with chloro￾form–methanol (1/1) and treated with phospho￾lipase C from Bacillus cereus. To this end, PC was
dissolved in 1 ml diethylether–ethanol (95/5) and
stirred for 8 h in the presence of 0.5 ml aqueous
buffer containg 0.03 M H3BO3, 0.25 M HEPES (pH
7.2), and 15 U of enzyme. Diacylglycerol was
collected in the ether phase and derivatized with
3,5-dinitrobenzoylchloride in dry pyridine at 701C
for 15 min.20 Molecular species of 1,2-diacyl-3-(30
,50
-
dinitrobenzoyl)glycerol were resolved by reversed￾phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a
Nucleosil C18 column (4.6  250 mm, 5 mm parti￾cles) eluted with acetonitrile-2-propanol (4/1). The
flow rate was 1 ml/min. Chromatograms were re￾corded by a multiple wavelength UV/VIS detector
set at 254 nm. Molecular species were identified by
comparison with standard compounds and by fatty
acid analysis.
Electron Microscopy
Lymphoblast pellets were fixed with 2% glutaralde￾hyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, for
3 h. Pellets were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide/
cacodylate buffer for 2 h. Cells were in-block stained
with 1.3% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min. After
dehydration in ethanol and substitution with
propylene oxide, the samples were embedded in
epoxy resin. Thin sections (10 nm) were collected
on carbon-coated grids. They were contrasted with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were taken
with a JEOL JEM1200EXII electron microscope.
Flow Cytometry and Imaging of Lymphoblasts
One million lymphoblasts were incubated in 1.5 ml
culture medium with 0.5 mM MitoTracker Red
CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at
371C, in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 30 min. The stained
cells were washed twice with pre-warmed medium
and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 371C for

15 min. Thereafter cells were washed three times
with phosphate-buffered saline. Single red color
flow cytometry analysis was performed with a
Beckton Dickinson FACS Calibur instrument. For
image analysis, stained lymphoblasts were spread
on glass slides mounted with the AQUA-poly/
mount medium (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington,
PA, USA). Cells were illuminated with a 100 W
mercury arc lamp (AttoArcs2 HBO 100 W, ZEISS).
Red fluorescence emissions were collected through
a 63X Plan-APOCHROMAT, 1.40NA oil objective
(ZEISS) using a standard HQ:TRITC/DIL filter
set (CHROMA, Rockingham, VT, USA). The cells
were imaged with a non-laser Atto Confocal
Image System (ATTO Bioscience, Rockville, MD,
USA), including an Axiovert 135 inverted fluore￾scence microscope (ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany)
equipped with a cooled CCD imaging digital camera
with extended IR range and extra sensitivity (ORCA￾ER Digital Camera, C4742-95, HAMAMATSU).
Fluorescence emissions were captured as 12-bit
images using the video sensor of the CCD digital
camera at 1024  1024 pixel resolution and analyzed
using AttoView software. Consecutive frames of
about 0.2 mm optical sections (Z-series) were col￾lected with CARVers and their confocal 3D images
were reconstructed using LSM PC software (ZEISS).
Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
One million lymphoblasts, growing at mid-logarith￾mic phase, were incubated in 1.5 ml culture medium
with 7.5 mM JC-1 (5,50
,6,60
-tetrachloro-1, 10
,3,30
-tetra￾ethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide, Molecu￾lar Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 10 min at 371C
in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The JC-1 stained cells
were washed three times with PBS, suspended in
1 ml phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal
bovine serum, and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry. The green fluorescence emission (JC-1
monomers) was monitored at 520 nm and the
red-orange fluorescence emission (J-aggregates) was
monitored at 590 nm. The aggregate/monomer ratio
was proportional to the mitochondrial membrane
potential. To determine the reference signal of
uncoupled mitochondria, cells were pretreated with
1 mM carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl￾hydrazone for 5 min before staining.
Mitochondrial ATP Formation
Mitochondrial ATP synthesis was measured in
permeabilized cells similar to a previously pub￾lished protocol.21 Lymphoblasts (107 cells) were
suspended in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline and
permeabilized by incubation with 15 mg digitonin
for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction was
stopped by dilution with phosphate-buffered saline.
Permeabilized cells were collected by centrifugation
and resuspended in 0.5 ml oxphos medium, contain￾ing 110 mM KCl, 5 mM glutamic acid, 5 mM succinic
acid, 5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EGTA, 3 mM EDTA,
10 mM Tris, 25 mM P1
P5
-di(adenosine-50
-)pentaphos￾phate, and 2 mM iodoacetate (pH 7.4 by KOH). The
suspension was divided into 60-ml aliquots and ATP
formation was initiated by addition of 100 nmol
ADP. Every measurement was accompanied by a
control sample that contained 1 mg oligomycin to
inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. The incubation
was stopped after 10 min by addition of 100 ml
HClO4 (14%). Precipitated protein was removed by
centrifugation, 140 ml of the supernatant were with￾drawn and neutralized with 80 ml of 1.6 M Na2CO3.
The concentration of ATP was measured in the
neutralized perchloric acid extracts by coupled
enzyme assay using a fluorescence spectrophoto￾meter.22 ATP formation was shown to be linear with
respect to incubation time. Mitochondrial ATP
formation was calculated from the difference of
ATP in the presence and absence of oligomycin.
Statistical Analysis
For each experiment, lymphoblast cultures from five
individuals were measured in the control group and
the BTHS group, respectively. Data were expressed
as means with standard error of mean (n ¼ 5).
Comparisons between groups were performed by
Student’s t-test.
Results
Analysis of Phospholipids
Previously, we found reduced concentration and
abnormal fatty acid composition of CL in various
tissues from BTHS patients.10 Although the concen￾tration of other phospholipids remained normal in
BTHS,10 it was not known whether or not the fatty
acid composition of these phospholipids was
affected as well. In the present study, we provided
a comprehensive fatty acid analysis of PC, PE,
and CL in lymphoblasts from BTHS patients and
controls (Table 1).
As expected, BTHS induced significant changes
in the CL acyl pattern. In particular, palmitoleic
(16:1) and linoleic (18:2) acid were replaced by
palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acid. Furthermore,
there was a shift from oleic acid (18:1 D9
) to vaccenic
acid (18:1 D11), as a result of which vaccenic acid
became the dominant acyl group in CL from BTHS
lymphoblasts.
We also found some alterations in the fatty acid
composition of PC, most notably an increase in
palmitoleic acid at expense of oleic acid (Table 1).
Analysis of the PC molecular species showed an
increase of 16:0–16:1-PC at the expense of 16:0–
18:1-PC in BTHS lymphoblasts (Figure 1). The
BTHS-associated changes of PC were present in
both the mitochondrial and the microsomal fraction.

In general, there was no appreciable difference
between the fatty acid compositions of mitochon￾drial and microsomal PC (Table 2).
The fatty acid composition of PE was almost
normal in BTHS, except for a small increase in
palmitoleic acid (Table 1). Again, this small altera￾tion was detected in both mitochondria and micro￾somes. In all lymphoblasts, mitochondrial PE
contained more stearic acid than microsomal PE
(Table 2).
Characterization of Mitochondria
Since CL is specifically associated with the mito￾chondrial compartment, we studied the function
and structural organization of lymphoblast mito￾chondria. First, we stained lymphoblasts with
MitoTracker Red CMXRos to visualize the distribu￾tion of mitochondria within the cell (Figure 2). In
normal lymphoblasts, mitochondria lined the
periphery of the cytoplasm and they often formed
a small density at one side of the cell. This
observation was consistent with previous studies,
showing mitochondria in two cellular compart￾ments, namely the narrow cytoplasmic layer
surrounding the large nucleus and the space near
the nuclear invagination.23
In BTHS, the polarity of the mitochondrial
organization increased. Typically, there was a sub￾stantial accumulation of MitoTracker dye at one
side of the cell. Flow cytometry demonstrated an
overall increase of dye concentration in BTHS
lymphoblasts (Figure 2). In theory, the increase in
dye concentration could be the result of higher dye
affinity or it could be the result of increased
mitochondrial mass in BTHS. Examination of
lymphoblasts by transmission electron microscopy
supported the latter explanation, as it showed an
impressive accumulation of mitochondria, espe￾cially near the nuclear invagination (Figure 3).
Morphometric analysis confirmed a higher surface
density of mitochondria and a higher number of
mitochondrial cross-sections in lymphoblasts from
BTHS patients (Table 3).

Next, we determined the ability of lymphoblasts
to perform oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochon￾drial membrane potential (DCm) was monitored with
the fluorescence probe JC-1. We found a reduction of
DCm by about 30% in BTHS lymphoblasts compared
to controls (Figure 4). Furthermore, we measured
the rate of mitochondrial ATP formation. For this
purpose, lymphoblasts were permeabilized with
digitonin and incubated in an assay buffer that
contained inhibitors of other ATP synthetic or
consuming reactions, including glycolysis, adeny￾late kinase, and ATP hydrolysis.21 We found that the
rate of mitochondrial ATP formation was similar in
lymphoblasts from BTHS patients and controls
(Figure 5).
Discussion
In this study, we used lymphoblasts to characterize
mitochondrial properties of patients with BTHS. We
found hyperproliferation of mitochondria combined
with abnormalities in energy metabolism, support￾ing the idea that BTHS is a mitochondrial disease.24
Dysfunction of mitochondria provides a plausible
explanation for some of the most common symp￾toms of BTHS, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and
skeletal muscle weakness.
Involvement of mitochondria in BTHS has been
suspected ever since the disease was described,
mainly because of reduced cytochrome con￾centrations and diminished respiratory enzyme
activities in skeletal muscle biopsies from affected
individuals.1,25–27 However, it has been difficult to

demonstrate the specificity of these changes in
relation to BTHS. Thus, definite conclusions about
the mitochondrial pathology could not be drawn,
although it appeared that the mitochondrial dys￾function was not caused by a defect in any specific
respiratory enzyme.3 This concept was consistent
with the lipid etiology of BTHS.6,7,9 Since phospho￾lipids form the general environment of membrane
proteins, they may influence the performance of
multiple respiratory enzymes. The phospholipid
most affected by the disease was CL, which under￾went a complete reorganization of its fatty acid
pattern. Specific involvement of CL corresponded
with the mitochondrial localization of tafazzin.28
However, the lipid abnormalities in BTHS were
not confined to CL. PC showed a distinct alteration
of its fatty acid composition, which, although less
drastic than in CL, was consistently present in
lymphoblasts from BTHS patients. The composi￾tional change in lymphoblast PC, namely a shift
from 16:0–18:1-PC to 16:0–16:1-PC, supports our
hypothesis that acyl groups are transferred from PC
to CL for the purpose of fatty acid remodeling.15 As

decrease of 16:0–18:1-PC due to inhibition of the step 1 reaction.
Likewise, BTHS caused increase of 16:0–18:2-PC and decrease of
16:0–20:4-PC in heart.10 LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; MLCL,

Fluorescence Ratio
Figure 4 Mitochondrial membrane potential (DCm) in lympho￾blasts. DCm was monitored by flow cytometry after staining
of lymphoblasts with the dye JC-1. The ratio of red fluorescence
(JC-1 aggregates) over green fluorescence (JC-1 monomers) was
calculated as a surrogate of DCm. Carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoro￾methoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to determine the
fluorescence ratio of uncoupled mitochondria (DCm ¼ 0).

sequence, in which PC donates 16:1 residues to
monolyso-CL, followed by reacylation of lyso-PC
with 18:1. In BTHS, where the PC/CL transacylation
is inhibited, our model predicts a rise of 16:1 in PC,
a decline of 16:1 in CL, and a decline of 18:1 in PC.
This is exactly what we found in BTHS lympho￾blasts. The model is also applicable to heart, where
we described complementary changes in PC and CL
of two BTHS patients.10 In these two patients,
cardiac 16:0–18:2-PC increased at the expense of
16:0–20:4-PC. This, together with the lack of 18:2 in
CL, suggested that 18:2 was transferred from PC to
CL and 20:4 was used to reacylate lyso-PC (Figure 6).
Although our data supported the notion that the
metabolic defect of BTHS was localized in mito￾chondria, the same compositional change of PC was
found in microsomes. It is possible that tafazzin is
also involved in phospholipid remodeling outside
of mitochondria, but a more likely interpretation of
the microsomal data is that mitochondrial and
microsomal PCs are in equilibrium. Rapid exchange
of lipids between membranes may be mediated by
lipid transfer proteins29 or it may occur at contact
sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic
reticulum.30 Finally, crosscontamination during the
isolation of mitochondrial and microsomal fractions
may contribute to an equilibration of the molecular
species.
The lipid abnormalities led to a compromise of
bioenergetic coupling in lymphoblast mitochondria
from BTHS patients. Impaired coupling was also
observed in tafazzin-deficient yeast, where Ma
et al28 found a decrease of the P/O ratio and the
respiratory control ratio. Their data suggested low
coupling efficiency, presumably due to the inability
to maintain DCm. Our data directly confirmed that
DCm was low in BTHS patients.
However, oxidative ATP formation of BTHS
lymphoblasts was normal, a finding that may be
explained by the increase in mitochondrial mass.
Since ATP formation was measured in digitonin￾treated cells, it is also possible that the experimental
protocol altered the properties of the inner mito￾chondrial membrane to an extent that would
obscure any difference between BTHS and controls.
Nevertheless, mitochondrial proliferation, mainly
near the nuclear invagination, is consistent with the
observation of preserved ATP production in the face
of low DCm. Abnormal proliferation of mitochondria
is a pathologic hallmark of mitochondrial myopa￾thies.24 This hyperproliferation is generally thought
to compensate for deficiencies in mitochondrial
energy production. Its presence in BTHS reaffirms
that the disease belongs to the broad category of
mitochondrial disorders.
