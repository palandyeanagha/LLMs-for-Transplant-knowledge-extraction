Abstract
Brain-dead donor organ transplantation has been available to children in Japan since the 2010 revision of the
Organ Transplant Law. Of the 50–60 brain-dead donor organ transplants performed annually in Japan, however,
very few (0–4 per year) are performed in children. Again, while those receiving liver, heart, and kidney transplants
are reported to fare better than their counterparts in the rest of the world, organ shortage is becoming a matter of
great concern. Very few organs become available from brain-dead donors or are transplanted to adults if made
available at all, with some children dying while on the brain-dead organ waiting list. Against this background,
living-donor transplants, split-liver transplants, domino transplants, and hepatocyte transplants represent alternative
modalities, each of which is shown to be associated with favorable outcomes. Challenges exist, include streamlining
the existing framework for promoting organ donation for children and between children.

Background
With the revision in 2010 of the Organ Transplant
Law in Japan, the criteria for determining brain death
in children was established, and organ donation
became legal even from those less than 15 years of
age. This has opened up a new venue of transplant￾ation for children with organ failure, alongside
overseas heart/other vital organ transplantation and
living-donor liver/kidney transplantation, which have
remained mainstays over the years.
In the meantime, a ventricular assist device (VAD)
has also been approved for use as a bridge to
transplantation in children with severe heart failure
thought unlikely to improve with conventional
pharmacotherapy, surgery, or assisted circulation.
Against this background, this review discusses the
current state of organ transplantation in children as well
as its future prospects.
Main text
In Japan, the Organ Transplant Law became effective in
1997, allowing organs to be harvested from brain-dead
donors. This required, however, that they have expressed
their wishes for organ donation in writing while still
alive and that their families agree to honor their wishes.
Wishes for organ donation were only deemed valid if
expressed by those 15 years of age or older, and thus,
organ donation from those less than 15 years of age was
not allowed. Therefore, children with end-stage organ
failure had no recourse but extremely expensive overseas
organ transplants or if at all available, live-donor organ
transplants. Only with the revision in 2010 of the Organ
Transplant Law did it become possible to determine
brain death and harvest organs from brain-dead individ￾uals 15 years of age or older despite their unclear (or un￾expressed) wishes or from children less than 15 years of
age if familial consent was obtained. The revision also
involved prioritizing an individual’s donation prefer￾ences; individuals were now able to express wishes, while
alive, regarding their possible wish to give their relatives
preferential treatment in terms of who receives the
organs.
Thus, of note, brain death has made heart and liver
transplants possible, which cardiac arrest did not. All
those who wish to receive organs from brain-dead
donors are now registered with the Japan Organ Transplant
Network (JOT), with the number of individuals on the
waiting list shown by organ (i.e., heart, lung, liver, kidney,

pancreas, and small intestine) on the JOT website. Of those
less than 15 years of age on the waiting list, 31, 6, 11, 55,
and 0 were registered for heart, lung, liver, kidney, and pan￾creas, respectively, as of October 2016. The background
characteristics of these registrants are also shown by organ,
which include blood type, age group, underlying disease re￾quiring transplantation, urgency of treatment, and time on
the waiting list [1].
In contrast, organs were donated from a total of 12
brain-dead individuals less than 15 years of age
(including six children less than 6 years of age) be￾tween July 2010 and October 2016 or 0–4 brain-dead
individuals per year (Fig. 1) [2]. This is not only true
of the pediatric donors but of the entire donor popu￾lation, where the number of brain-dead donors has
gradually increased since the 2010 revision of the
Organ Transplant Law but has leveled off at 50–60 per
year. Again, the number of organs harvested from both
brain-dead and cardiac arrest (non-heart-beating) donors
totaled 100–110 per year between 2006 and 2012 but less
than 100 in 2013 and afterwards. Thus, it is clear that
brain-dead organ donors have tended to increase, but the
entire organ donor population has tended to decrease in
numbers over time (Fig. 2) [3].
Among the pediatric donors less than 15 years of age
(n = 43; brain-dead, 10; non-heart-beating, 33), the
causes of their death included cerebrovascular disease
(n = 5), brain tumors (n = 7), respiratory diseases (n = 2),
cardiovascular disease (n = 1), other internal causes
(n = 3), head injury (n = 12), and other external
causes (n = 13), and their mean age was 7.7 ± 4.5 years old
(0–4 years, 12; 5–9 years, 12; and 10–14 years, 19) [2].
An examination of organ transplants performed
abroad shows that transplants from deceased donors
account for the largest proportion of all transplants
performed in the USA, with those from brain-dead
donors totaling 8000–9000 per year and those from
brain-dead and non-heart-beating donors combined
totaling more than 9000 per year in 2015 and 2016
[4]. Of these, over 800 per year were less than
18 years old. It is worth noting a preliminary report
by an international registry which suggests that trans￾plants from deceased donors account for as few as
0.7 per million population (PMP) in Japan in 2015, in
stark contrast to 39.7 PMP in Spain, 28.5 PMP in the
USA, 10 PMP in Korea, and 2 PMP in China [5].
Indeed, even after the 2010 amendment of the
Organ Transplant Law, organs from deceased donors
have generally remained too few in number to fill the
needs of children requiring organ transplants in
Japan. Thus, transplants from deceased donors remain
an inadequate life-saving means for children, and as a
consequence, some die while on the transplant
waiting list.
To maximize the use of limited organs being made
available from donors, a medical consultant system
was launched in 2002 in Japan. This system involves
dispatching physicians to prospective donors to en￾sure their hemodynamic stability, thereby improving
their cardiopulmonary function. With this system in
place, the number of organs transplanted per donor
(OTPD) improved to as many as 6.8 in 2008, com￾pared to 3.04 in the USA [6–8].
In what follows, we propose to describe the character￾istics of representative organ transplants being per￾formed in Japan.
Liver transplants
The patient numbers and the diseases to need
transplantation
According to the annual report of the Japanese Liver
Transplantation Society [9], as of the end of 2015, the
Fig. 1 Number of pediatric deceased organ donations in Japan by year (<15 years; n = 43)
Nishimura et al. Journal of Intensive Care (2017) 5:48 Page 2 of 10

number of livers transplanted since the first liver
transplanted at Shimane University in 1989 totaled
8387, of which 8066 and 321 were from living donors
and brain-dead donors, respectively. Of the 8387 or￾gans transplanted, 2942 were from children less than
18 years old, who accounted for a high proportion of
organs harvested from all age groups. Additionally, of
the 2942 organs from these children, 2897 and 45 or￾gans were from living donors and brain-dead donors,
respectively. Four to five hundred liver transplants
were performed, with about 140 of these performed
annually in children in 2014 and 2015 (Fig. 3) [9].
Indications for liver transplantation in children vary
from those in adults and include cholestatic liver dis￾ease (mainly biliary atresia), which accounts for ap￾proximately 70% of all liver transplants performed,
followed by metabolic liver disease and acute liver
failure, each of which accounts for about 10% of all
liver transplants performed (Table 1) [10].
The prognosis
Japanese children less than 18 years of age receiving liver
transplants are shown to fare better than adults with the
survival rate being 89.4% at 1 year, 86.8% at 5 years,
84.4% at 10 years, and 80.9% at 20 years (versus 81.6% at
1 year, 72.7% at 5 years, 65.6% at 10 years, and 51.5% at
20 years) [9]; they are also shown to fare better than
their counterparts in Western countries [11, 12].
Single-center experience
As of December 2016, a total of 60–70 liver transplants
were performed at our center; to date, 22 livers were
transplanted from brain-dead donors (Fig. 4).

Acute liver failure is defined as “hepatic dysfunction
in patients with normal livers or normal hepatic re￾serve, which is accompanied by a prothrombin time
of less than 40% or an INR of 1.5 or higher within
8 weeks of onset of initial symptoms due to severe
hepatic dysfunction” and is handled as consistent with
fulminant hepatic failure presenting as acute hepatic
coma of grade II or higher. While aggressive blood
purification therapy is implemented in those diag￾nosed with fulminant hepatic failure, liver transplant￾ation is required in those who respond poorly to such
medical therapy. Indeed, fulminant hepatic failure
represents a more challenging emergency than other
diseases and may well represent an indication for liver
transplantation from brain-dead donors. Eligibility cri￾teria for prospective liver recipients from brain-dead
donors are defined in terms of scoring based on their
prognosis, underlying disease and clinical urgency
(Table 2), where highly urgent and serious fulminant
hepatic failure is scored 10 out of 10.
We previously reported our single-center experience
with patients with acute liver failure [13, 14]. Of the 65
patients treated at our center for acute liver failure be￾tween November 2005 and December 2015, 54 patients
(83.1%) received liver transplants.
The post-transplant rescue rate in children with ful￾minant hepatic failure is reported to range between 67.5
and 80% [15, 16]. Furthermore, a small number of stud￾ies compared outcomes between those less than 1 year
old and those 1 year old or older, reporting that small
infants fared worse than children [17–19].
Post-transplant outcomes are summarized below for
the 47 children registered for liver transplants from
brain-dead donors at our center between July 2010 and
the end of 2012 (Table 3) [20]. A total of 25 candidates
called for urgent care for their conditions (acute liver
failure in nearly all cases) and had therefore been
assigned the highest scores, 10 out of 10. Of these 25 pa￾tients, 7 received transplants from deceased donors and
13 from living donors, and 1 patient died while on the
waiting list. A total of 10 patients, including those
assigned up to 6 out of 10, received transplants from
brain-dead donors. These results suggest that while
pediatric transplant candidates may stand a chance of re￾ceiving transplants from brain-dead donors, medically,
those candidates assigned the highest scores, 10 out of
10, based on the urgency and severity of their condi￾tions, should not be allowed to be on the waiting list for
transplants from brain-dead donors but should be con￾sidered immediate candidates for transplants from living
donors.
Bridging measures and further problems
Against this background, split-liver transplants, domino
transplants, and hepatocyte transplants are currently be￾ing pursued as viable options to make the most of brain￾dead donor livers that remain very few in number.
Split-liver transplantation involves splitting a liver
from an adult brain-dead donor into two fragments, with
the larger right lobe being given to an adult recipient
and the smaller left lobe (left lateral segment) being
given to a pediatric recipient to accommodate his/her
physique. Typically involving an adult transplant center,
this approach allows a liver from an adult brain-dead
donor to be transplanted in two recipients [21]. As of
the end of 2014, split-liver transplants performed in
Japan involved 36 of the 257 brain-dead donors who had
become available and showed comparable success rates

to whole-liver transplants. However, they accounted for
only 6.5% (10.7% after the amendment of the Organ
Transplant Law) of all transplants performed in Japan, a
markedly smaller proportion compared to that in
Western countries (Europe, 59.5%; USA, 16.1%), sug￾gesting that every effort should be made to define indi￾cations for split-liver transplants involving brain-dead
donors despite their limited availability.
Domino transplants initially involved patients with fa￾milial amyloid polyneuropathy as secondary donors but
have recently come to involve children with maple syrup
urine disease (MSUD), an inborn error of metabolism
(IEM), as primary recipients and as secondary donors
who, in turn, allow their livers to be removed and trans￾planted in non-MSUD patients [22]. While MSUD pa￾tients are associated with a deficiency in branched-chain
alpha keto acid dehydrogenase resulting in impaired ca￾tabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (BCCAs),
their livers may be made available for use in non-MSUD
patients, in that BCCAs become catabolized by other or￾gans than the liver in these patients. Several centers,
including ours, showed that five pediatric patients re￾ceived liver transplants from four MSUD patients [23].
Hepatocyte transplantation is a therapeutic modality
that involves engrafting exogenous normal hepatocytes
inside a partially dysfunctional host liver thereby com￾plementing its declining function. In this modality, a
proportion of the hepatocytes infused through an in￾dwelling portal-vein catheter become engrafted and inte￾grated and are thus thought likely to replace a deficient
enzyme or complement the declining function of the
host liver in acute hepatic failure. Being less invasive
than liver transplantation and feasible even in neonates
in whom liver transplantation proves less feasible, hep￾atocyte transplantation is currently being performed as
bridging to transplantation in some IEMs at our center,
where, to date, two neonates have undergone hepatocyte
transplantation, followed by liver transplantation [24].
Given that hepatocyte transplantation alone is re￾ported overseas to improve liver function in acute hep￾atic failure without recourse to liver transplantation,
hepatocyte transplantation appears to hold promise as a
novel option alongside the liver transplantation modal￾ities currently available [25–27]. In contrast, living￾donor transplants have remained the mainstay in Japan;
while they are associated with favorable recipient results,
post-transplant complications and procedure-related
mortality are also reported in 8.9 and 0.03%, respectively,
of the living donors [6, 28].
We believe that Japan as a whole needs to work to￾gether to further enhance the organ transplantation pro￾gram for children.
Specifically, attention needs to be focused not only on
minimizing complications in living donors but also on
increasing the number of potential brain-dead donors,

maximizing the use of organs available from brain-dead
donors, developing and advancing alternative approaches
to liver transplantation, and ensuring effective bridging
to liver transplantation [8].
Heart transplantation
The patient numbers and the diseases to need
transplantation
As of November 2016, the number of patients in need of
heart transplants and registered with JOT for heart
transplantation stands at 549, with those less than
15 years of age totaling 30 (as of January 5, 2017; see the
JOT website).
According to a nationwide survey conducted by the
Japanese Society of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac
Surgery (JSPCCS) Committee for Heart Transplantation,
children requiring heart transplants total some 50 annu￾ally in Japan [29]. Following approval of pediatric indica￾tions for heart transplantation, the survival rate among
the pediatric recipients is shown to be 32.5% at 1 year
post-transplant with the mean survival time (time to
death) being 7.5 months post-transplant [30]. The time
on the waiting list was approximately 900 days (more
than 1000 days for 2015) even among those with severe
heart disease thus representing high-priority “status 1”
candidates. Statistics suggest that Japanese candidates
for heart transplants are on the waiting list relatively
longer than their counterparts in the rest of the world,
with 31% of these patients (including adults)dying while
on the waiting list [31]. Indeed, in 2015, the duration of
patients who required VAD was on average, approxi￾mately 50 days in the USA, while for the 22 cases out of
44 cases who received transplantation in 2015 (50% of
the cases), the duration for requiring VAD was more
than 3 years in Japan [32]. Thus, patients who require
transplantation in Japan need to wait much longer than
their counterparts in the USA.
In Japan, VAD is intended as a bridge to transplant￾ation and indicated for those with severe heart failure re￾quiring circulatory assistance. Available data shows that
those who have received heart transplants to date in
Japan (n = 265) all represented the “status 1” category
except 1 patient aged less than 6 years old; and, of these,
246 (92.8%) had been on VAD pre-transplant [33, 34]. In
contrast, US candidates in the “status 1” category
accounted for 62% of the 2200 heart transplants per￾formed annually in the USA, with 45% of these patients
shown to have been on VAD [34].
Globally, more than 550 heart transplants are being
performed annually in those less than 18 years old [35],
a statistic in stark contrast to three to four heart trans￾plants performed annually in pediatric candidates in
Japan (Fig. 5). Indeed, more pediatric candidates are re￾ceiving heart transplants overseas, with 104 patients
under 18 receiving heart transplants overseas by the end
of 2014 (Fig. 6). However, heart transplants overseas re￾main extremely costly, with the pre- to post-transplant
cost per transplant including outpatient visits expected
ranging from 80 million to 200 million yen. They are
not only becoming increasingly less feasible with very
few countries available for such transplants following the
Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and
Transplant Tourism in 2008 but they also give rise to as￾sociated ethical issues such as the risk of those dying on
the waiting list overseas.
As of August 2016, only four facilities are available in
Japan for pediatric heart transplantation in children
10 years old or younger. The indications for heart trans￾plantation in children do not vary from those in adults,
and these currently include dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM), dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(D-HCM), and myocardial ischemia, for which conven￾tional treatments are unlikely to be life-saving or to pro￾long life expectancy, as well as any other heart disease
indicated for heart transplantation by the JSPCCS Con￾ferences on Heart Transplant Indications [34]. Besides
these, potential indications include congenital heart dis￾ease unlikely to be amenable to correction with surgical
interventions, which accounts for the highest proportion
(54%) of all indications for heart transplantation among
infants less than 1 year old overseas [35].
A total of 18 children received heart transplants in Japan
as of December 31, 2015 (n = 18), and their underlying dis￾eases included DCM (n = 14), restrictive cardiomyopathy
(RCM) (n = 1), D-HCM (n = 1), post-myocarditis (n = 1),
and DCM/RCM (n = 1) but no congenital heart disease.
The transplants involved nine adult and nine pediatric

donors, and the mean age of the recipients was 11.9 ±
5.4 years of age at the time of transplantation [33].
The prognosis
The post-transplant 10-year survival rate among those
receiving heart transplants in Japan (n = 222) is shown
to be favorable at 89.3% compared to 53% reported
for the International Society for Heart and Lung
Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry, and the 10-year
survival rate by age group is shown to be 100%, with
one recipient dying 11 years after transplantation.
Thus, Japanese heart recipients appear to fare better
than those in the ISHLT Registry, where the 10-year
survival rate is shown to be about 60% among all
pediatric recipients, while the survival rate varies by
age at transplant among those aged less than 18 years
of age [36, 37].
Despite these favorable outcomes, pediatric heart
transplantation as it stands in Japan has major chal￾lenges, in that the number of donors is out of proportion
to that of prospective recipients. These transplant candi￾dates are expected to be on the waiting list for as long as
2–3 years while remaining on VAD, resulting in many
candidates opting to go abroad to receive transplants or
face the risk of dying from complications while on the
waiting list.
Kidney transplantation
Kidney transplantation typically becomes feasible when
it involves kidneys from brain-dead or non-heart-beating
donors who expressed wishes to donate their organs in
writing while still alive or whose wishes are unclear but
their families have given consent to donate their organs
(hereafter deceased donors). It differs from other forms
of transplantation in that a range of treatment options
are available to those with end-stage renal failure, which
include ① peritoneal dialysis, ② hemodialysis, and ③
kidney transplantation, thus allowing time for alternative
options to kidney transplantation.

The patient numbers and the diseases to need
transplantation
In 2015, a total of 1661 kidney transplants were per￾formed, involving 1494 kidneys from living donors
(89.8%), 63 kidneys from non-heart-beating donors
who had expressed wishes to donate their organs
while still alive or for whom their families had given
consent to donate their organs, and 104 kidneys from
brain-dead donors who had expressed wishes to do￾nate their organs while still alive or for whom their
families had given consent to donate their organs. Of
these transplants, those transplanted in children less
than 20 years old involved kidneys from 77 living do￾nors and 15 deceased donors [34].
According to the report of Hattori et al., a total of
540 children developed end-stage renal failure in the
6 years between 2006 and 2011, accounting for an
annual incidence of 3.5–4.7/PMP. Of note, preemptive
kidney transplantation was performed in 22.3% of
these patients without recourse to peritoneal dialysis
or hemodialysis [38].
While the causes of end-stage renal failure in chil￾dren vary by age bracket in Japan, congenital anomal￾ies of the kidney and urinary tract are reported to be
the most frequent, followed by hereditary nephropa￾thy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [38, 39].
In recent years, a total of 90 or so transplants have
been performed in children annually (involving living
donors in more than 90% of cases), as well as six to
eight transplants (except 2013) from deceased donors
following the amendment of the Organ Transplant
Law in 2010 which now allowed transplants from
such donors. Very few transplants have been per￾formed in those aged less than 16 years old and those
aged 16–20 years old, despite their being assigned
higher scores and thus prioritized for kidney trans￾plantation (Fig. 7) [2].
The prognosis
The Japan Society for Transplantation has reported on
post-transplant survival rates among the transplant recipi￾ents including adults, stratifying by organ donor, living or
deceased, as well as by age bracket, demonstrating im￾proved transplant outcomes over the years, irrespective of
the organ donors involved (Table 4) [34].
Similarly, post-transplant outcomes are shown to be
improving over the years, irrespective of the organ
donors, according to the report of the Japan Pediatric
Kidney Transplantation Clinical Statistics Subcommit￾tee, with the 5- and 10-year engraftment rates being
96.4 and 92.3% in kidneys from living donors and
83.5 and 68% from those from deceased donors, re￾spectively [40].
These data compare favorably with those reported
overseas [41, 42].
Currently, ABO-incompatible kidney transplant￾ation is being performed in about 10% of all kidney
recipients, accounting for a greater proportion than
that reported for the US counterparts (0.2%), while
the modality appears to be associated with better
outcomes, leading to re-transplantation being
required only in 3–4% of ABO-incompatible kidney
recipients, compared to 8.3% in the USA [43].
Preferential organ allocation to pediatric
transplant candidates
While the reported engraftment rates argue for the
use of pediatric hearts in pediatric transplant candi￾dates, there are reported cases of bilateral kidneys be￾ing transplanted from a pediatric donor to an adult
recipient not only because of similar engraftment and
survival rates reported between children and adults
but because of its role in maintaining adequate renal func￾tion. Of note, however, there is an increasing focus on the
preferential use of kidneys from pediatric donors in
Fig. 7 Number of pediatric deceased-donor kidney transplants performed in Japan
Nishimura et al. Journal of Intensive Care (2017) 5:48 Page 8 of 10

pediatric transplant candidates, prompted by the observa￾tion that the longer the transplant candidate waits, the
greater the adverse influence on his/her growth and that
the use of organs from pediatric donors (less than 20 years
old) involves paying due regard for their parents and is
deemed appropriate in pediatric transplant candidates. In
liver transplantation as well, consideration is currently be￾ing given to ensuring the preferential use of livers from
pediatric donors less than 18 years old to pediatric trans￾plant candidates less than 18 years old.
Conclusions
The present review has described the current state of
organ transplantation in children. The absolute number
of potential deceased, including brain-dead, donors re￾mains small in Japan. While transplant outcomes are
shown to be favorable across organs in Japan, the lack of
availability of potential donors makes transplantation
medicine impossible.
There are various factors leading to the limited num￾ber of brain-dead donors, not the least of which is that
individuals need to recognize and address the differences
between Japan’s present transplantation situation and
that of foreign countries. We need to examine our exist￾ing institutions and systems and critically assess Japan’s
legal definition of brain death.
In the future, it will be a challenging for the country
to develop further laws and systems, but it is a vital step
towards improving patient outcomes.
Despite the various factors limiting the availability of
potential brain-dead donors, however, attention needs to
be given to streamline the infrastructure for promoting
organ transplantation in children and priority needs to be
given to preferentially allocate organs to children thereby
maximizing their use and saving as many children’s lives
as possible. Last but not least, all practitioners need to
explore in daily clinical practice how best to address the
“donor shortage” issue, which is likely to remain unre￾solved for the foreseeable future.
