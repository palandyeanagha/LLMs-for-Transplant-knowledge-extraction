Abstract
The pathogeneses of parathyroid disease in patients with
uremia and nonfamilial primary parathyroid hyperplasia
are poorly understood. Because of multigland involvement,
it has been assumed that these common diseases predomi￾nantly involve polyclonal (non-neoplastic) cellular prolifer￾ations, but an overall assessment of their clonality has not
been done. We examined the clonality of these hyperplastic
parathyroid tumors using X-chromosome inactivation anal￾ysis with the M27,B (DXS255) DNA polymorphism and by
searching for monoclonal allelic losses at M27f3 and at loci
on chromosome band 11q13. Fully 7 of 11 informative hemo￾dialysis patients (64%) with uremic refractory hyperpara￾thyroidism harbored at least one monoclonal parathyroid
tumor (with a minimum of 12 of their 19 available glands
being monoclonal). Tumor monoclonality was demonstra￾ble in 6 of 16 informative patients (38%) with primary
parathyroid hyperplasia. Histopathologic categories of nod￾ular versus generalized hyperplasia were not useful pre￾dictors of clonal status. These observations indicate that
monoclonal parathyroid neoplasms are common in patients
with uremic refractory hyperparathyroidism and also de￾velop in a substantial group of patients with sporadic pri￾mary parathyroid hyperplasia, thereby changing our con￾cept of the pathogenesis of these diseases. Neoplastic trans￾formation of preexisting polyclonal hyperplasia, apparently
due in large part to genes not yet implicated in parathyroid
tumorigenesis and possibly including a novel X-chromosome
tumor suppressor gene, is likely to play a central role in
these disorders. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:2047-2053.) Key

have traditionally been referred to as parathyroid hyperplasia,
but the implicit assumption that such multigland involvement
consists of true polyclonal responses to generalized growth
stimuli may not be accurate in all instances. Furthermore, it is
possible that in certain patients or glands an initially polyclonal
hyperplasia may evolve into a monoclonal neoplasm, which
might have more autonomous hormonal function or growth
properties.
Common (nonfamilial) primary parathyroid hyperplasia is
responsible for 15% of all cases of primary hyperparathyroid￾ism; the term primary in this instance may simply reflect our
ignorance of the stimuli driving a polyclonal expansion of all
parathyroid cells. Alternatively, multigland involvement might
bespeak a high likelihood of independent clonal neoplasms aris￾ing in each of a patient's glands. As was the case in the study
of parathyroid adenomas (1) and multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 1 (MEN-i)' (2, 3), an assessment of the clonality of
parathyroid glands in parathyroid hyperplasia is likely to pro￾vide fruitful insights into its pathogenesis.
Uremic refractory secondary hyperparathyroidism is charac￾terized by hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue that no longer
responds appropriately to physiological influences or usually
efficacious medical therapy; the resulting autonomous PTH se￾cretion may cause clinical problems like hypercalcemia, bone
disease, or nephrocalcinosis (4). Parathyroid glands in this dis￾order might be true polyclonal expansions that have become so
large that the summation of all cells' nonsuppressible basal
secretion of PTH is excessive for the patient. Alternatively,
clonal transformation may have, in essence, created an adenoma
in one or more glands. One such clonal lesion was reported to
occur in a small minority of uremic parathyroid glands (5) but
a comprehensive examination of clonality in this disease has not
been performed. In addition, parathyroid gland monoclonality or
polyclonality might correspond to histologic patterns of nodular
versus generalized hypercellularity; uremic patients with nodu￾lar parathyroid hyperplasia were reported to have a higher rate
of recurrent hyperparathyroidism after surgical parathyroidec￾tomy than uremic patients with purely diffuse hyperplasia (6).
Clonality can be assessed from the proportion of a woman's
tumor cells in which a particular X-chromosome is inactivated.
This method's utility does not depend on foreknowledge of the
particular genes causing clonal transformation and has been
widely validated in studies of many human tumors, including
parathyroid adenomas and other endocrine tumors (1, 7-18).
We used X-chromosome inactivation analysis to examine the
clonal status of nonfarnilial primary parathyroid hyperplasia and

uremic refractory hyperparathyroidism and also assessed these
tumors for evidence of clonal DNA losses at specific loci.
Methods
Patients and tumor specimens
Primary parathyroid hyperplasia. We studied tumors from 16 unse￾lected and unrelated women with a diagnosis of typical primary parathy￾roid hyperplasia. The mean age of the patients was 60.8 yr (range 21-
80). All patients were hypercalcemic (average serum calcium 12.3 mg/
dl, range 10.7-14.7). All had elevated (or inappropriately normal)
serum parathyroid hormone levels, which ranged from 0.7 to 15 times
the upper limit of normal. No patient had a history of neck irradiation,
features of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, or any family
history of hyperparathyroidism. At surgery, multiple hypercellular para￾thyroid glands were identified and removed from each patient. Histo￾pathological confirmation of multigland parathyroid hyperplasia was
obtained in each case. No patient remained hypercalcemic postopera￾tively. Gland weights (data available for 10 tumors) ranged from 230
to 2,020 mg (mean 947 mg). Linear dimensions were available for the
remaining 9 tumors, and weights were estimated from the regression
Wt (g) = 0.585 RV(cm3) + 0.134, where RV is the product of 3
dimensions ( 19); inclusion of these estimated weights raised the com￾bined mean weight to 1,396 mg. For 14 of the 16 patients, 1 gland
(typically that patient's largest) was obtained for study. For one patient,
two glands were available for study and for another patient three glands
were available. For these cases, no gross or histopathologic distinction
between nodular and generalized hyperplastic pattern was attempted by
the surgeon or pathologist. In addition, we obtained a single gland from
each of two male patients with primary hyperplasia. All patients with
primary hyperplasia were operated on at the Massachusetts General
Hospital.
Secondary parathyroid hyperplasia. We studied tumors from 11
female uremic patients with refractory secondary parathyroid hyperpla￾sia. The mean age of these patients was 49.5 yr (range 35-63). All
patients were treated and operated on in Paris, France. All patients
were on intermittent hemodialysis treatment for chronic renal failure.
Parathyroid surgery was indicated because of severe secondary hyper￾parathyroidism associated with pruritus, radiologic evidence of osteitis
fibrosa, soft tissue calcifications, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia,
and/or other symptoms and signs which were resistant to medical treat￾ment (6). In no case was chronic renal failure a consequence of primary
hyperparathyroidism. 7 of the 11 patients were hypercalcemic in the
absence of calcium or vitamin D therapy, and 4 were normocalcemic.
Serum PTH levels were markedly elevated in all instances (average 16-
fold above the upper limit of normal). Serum phosphate levels were
elevated in 10 of the 11 patients. No patient had a family history of
hyperparathyroidism or multiple endocrine neoplasia, or a history of
head and neck irradiation. In all patients, multiple hypercellular parathy￾roid glands were identified and resected. These glands were categorized
as either nodular hyperplasia or generalized hyperplasia by gross and
histopathologic criteria (20-22). Gland sizes ranged from 30 to 5,980
mg. In 2 of the 11 patients, a 30- and 700-mg parathyroid graft to the
arm was available for study. One parathyroid gland was available for
study from five of the patients; two glands each were available for study
from two patients; and four glands each were available from two pa￾tients. In addition, we obtained 17 glands from 9 male patients with
uremic refractory parathyroid hyperplasia. No male patient had a family
history of hyperparathyroidism. Their mean age was 43.8 yr (range
19-71).
Control, normal parathyroid glands. 15 normal parathyroid glands
which required removal during surgery for thyroid disease or as biopsy
specimens during surgery for isolated parathyroid adenoma were ob￾tained from 14 women; one additional normal gland was obtained at
autopsy from a victim of sudden cardiac arrest.
Peripheral blood leukocytes. Peripheral blood leukocytes were
available from 10 of the patients with primary hyperplasia, 11 of the
uremic patients, and from 8 randomly selected women without hemato￾logic disease.
All tissue and blood specimens were obtained in accord with institu￾tional human study procedures.
DNA sample preparation
All parathyroid specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen shortly after
surgical removal. High molecular weight DNA was extracted using
standard procedures.
M27,3 analysis of clonality
21 Mg of high molecular weight DNA from each sample was cut with
restriction endonuclease PstI for 2 h at 370C. After treatment with phe￾nol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in
10 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA and then split into three equal
aliquots. One aliquot received no further treatment; one aliquot was
further digested with restriction endonuclease MspI for 2 h at 370C; the
third aliquot was further digested with HpaII for 2 h at 370C. To assure
optimal activity of HpaII, a control sample, with an M27/3 band that
HpaII can cleave completely, was included in each set of digests. In
addition, selected samples with ambiguous M27,6 patterns that could
have been caused by partial digestion with HpaII were redigested; we
found that neither increasing the enzyme concentration, the final reaction
volume, nor the duration of the digest reaction had any effect on the
resultant Southern blot patterns. All DNA digests were loaded onto
0.8% agarose gels and electrophoresis was carried out for - 20 h at 65
V. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with ethidium bromide and
examined under ultraviolet light to assure complete digestion and even
loading of samples. Southern blotting was performed with standard
methodology, and blots were hybridized to 32P random primer-labeled
M27,f probe (23), washed at 550C in 0.1 x SSC and 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate, and autoradiographed, as described previously (1).
Autoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry, using a scanning laser
densitometer (Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Allelic cleavage ratios
were calculated based upon the change of intensity incurred by each of
the two bands seen in the original PstI digest, quite analogous to the
use of cleavage ratios in previous studies (1). A minimal allelic cleavage
ratio of 3.5 was chosen to provide a stringent, conservative definition
of a monoclonal pattern.
Clonality was also assessed by studying loss of heterozygosity at
llq13 and at M27,6. For llq13 analysis, - 3 ,ug each of male and
female patients' normal leukocyte DNA and tumor DNA was digested
for 2 h at 37°C with MspI. Digested samples were loaded onto 1%
agarose gels and electrophoresed for 16 h at 40 V. After electrophoresis,
Southern blotting was carried out as described above. Probes used for
hybridization were PYGM (24) and Dl S146 (25), obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Loss of heterozy￾gosity at M27/3 was assessed in PstI digests while carrying out X￾inactivation analysis of patients' normal leukocyte and tumor DNA
samples.
Rationale for use of M27,/3 in clonal analysis
As a first step, digestion of tumor DNA with PstI and subsequent probing
with the M27,/ probe permits the two X-chromosome alleles of a woman
to be distinguished. Subsequent digestion by the methylation-sensitive
restriction enzyme HpaII, which cuts at its recognition sites only when
such a site is unmethylated, allows clonal assessment. This is because
the critical HpaII sites in the M27fl region are methylated when present
on the active X-chromosome and are unmethylated, and thereby suscep￾tible to digestion, when present on the inactive X-chromosome (26-
30). Of the three MspI sites in the M27,B region (Fig. 1 A), the M3 site
is consistently methylated while Ml and M2 are partially or completely
unmethylated on the inactive X-chromosome allele (9). Therefore,
monoclonal tumors derived from a single progenitor cell will exhibit a
highly preferential pattern of HpaH cleavage, since the X-inactivation
pattern of the clonal progenitor is retained in all progeny that comprise

Of the three MspI/HpaII sites designated Ml, M2, and M3, only M3
is consistently methylated at its internal cytosine and therefore resistant
to cleavage with HpaII. The methylation of Ml and M2 varies in accord
with location on the active versus inactive X-chromosome (8). Intervals

need to be interpreted cautiously (see Discussion), positive findings
of monoclonality using M27,f are reliable and have shown excellent

Results
Primary parathyroid hyperplasia. 15 of 16 women with primary
parathyroid hyperplasia were informative with the M27f3 probe,
yielding a total of 18 informative parathyroid glands. Five of
these glands exhibited a convincing monoclonal X-inactivation
pattern, with an average allelic cleavage ratio of 13.8 (range
3.5-27.7) (Fig. 2 A). The remaining 13 glands exhibited either
a typical polyclonal or ambiguous pattern of X-inactivation (av￾erage allelic cleavage ratio 2.1 ). Of the 15 informative patients,
5 (33%) harbored at least 1 monoclonal gland as detected with
this method. In addition, one patient's gland with an ambiguous
M27f3 result later proved to be monoclonal based on loss of
heterozygosity at 1q13, increasing the percentage of patients
with monoclonal glands to 38%. There was no correlation be￾tween detectable monoclonality and the size of parathyroid tu￾mor, or serum calcium and PTH levels.

its complete allelic loss at M27#3 (Fig. 2 C). Of the 11 informa￾tive patients, 7 (64%) had at least 1 monoclonal parathyroid
neoplasm. It is interesting to note that in two patients with
multiple monoclonal glands a given M27,B allele was active in
one tumor and inactive in another (example in Fig. 3, A and
B). This finding emphasizes the independent clonal origins of
discrete tumors within the same patient. We found no correla￾tion between monoclonality and histopathologic categories of
generalized versus nodular hyperplasia in these patients (Table
I). The 7 patients who harbored at least 1 detectably monoclonal
tumor had a mean serum calcium of 11.2 mg/dl, as compared
with 10.0 mg/dl in those without a demonstrably monoclonal
gland; this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.27,
Student's t test, Wilcoxon non-parametric test).
Normal controls. Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from 24
of 29 patients was informative with M273. In no case did
normal leukocyte DNA yield a monoclonal M276 pattern (aver￾age allelic cleavage ratio 1.5, range 1.0-2.2). In addition, be￾cause tissue-specific differences in M27f3 clonality patterns
have been described (9), we examined 14 informative normal
parathyroid gland samples. Not one normal gland had a mono￾clonal X-inactivation pattern, the average allelic cleavage ratio
for this group being 1.7 (range 1.0-3.3) (Fig. 3 C). These
findings in polyclonal control tissues contrast sharply with the
monoclonal patterns found in the pathologic parathyroid glands
discussed above.
Allelic loss. The monoclonality of several tumors was able
to be ascertained by an entirely independent means, that of
assessment of clonal allelic loss of polymorphic DNA markers.
Monoclonal loss of heterozygosity detectable with the M27,3
probe was found in one gland from a uremic patient (Fig. 2
C). The tumor-specific allelic losses on the X-chromosome in
this case extended well beyond the M27f3 region, evidenced by
the finding of loss of heterozygosity at additional X-chromo￾some loci, namely DXS84, ARAFI, MAOB, DXS453, and
DXS3.
DNA markers at 1 1q13, known to incur clonal allelic losses
in a subset of parathyroid adenomas (2) and in MEN-i -related
tumors (2, 3, 24), were able to be assessed in 7 of the 16 female
patients and 2 males with primary parathyroid hyperplasia (i.e.,
those for whom control blood leukocyte samples were avail￾able). Five of these nine patients were heterozygous (informa￾tive) with at least one of the 1 1q13 probes tested. One informa￾tive example of primary hyperplasia, which had shown a poly￾clonal X-inactivation pattern, exhibited monoclonal loss of
heterozygosity at 1 1q13 (data not shown).
For patients with uremic parathyroid hyperplasia, leukocyte
control DNA was available from 11 females and 9 males, of
whom 10 (7 females and 3 males) were informative at an 1 1q13
marker locus. Of these 10 informative patients (total of 18
glands studied) none showed tumor-specific clonal loss of heter￾ozygosity at 1 lq13, including the 1 uremic patient who had
exhibited tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity with M27,B.

able to study four patients with a family history of hyperparathy￾roidism but without a clear diagnosis of MEN-1. Two of the
four glands from these four patients showed monoclonal allelic
loss at M27,8 and also at 1 1ql3, while the other two glands
showed a polyclonal/ambiguous X-inactivation pattern. These
glands with M27,6 allelic loss, similar to the previously de￾scribed gland from a uremic patient, had loss of heterozygosity
at multiple loci spanning both the short and long arms of the
X-chromosome.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that a substantial proportion (2 38%)
of patients with primary parathyroid hyperplasia harbor a mono￾clonal neoplasm in at least one of their hypercellular parathyroid
glands. An even larger group (2 64%) of patients with the
refractory secondary parathyroid hyperplasia of uremia who
have failed medical therapy have at least one clonal parathyroid
tumor (data summarized in Table II). In X-inactivation analyses
only a finding of monoclonality is definitive, while a polyclonal
pattern could be misleadingly seen for a variety of reasons
(such as normal tissue admixture or aberrant patterns of DNA
methylation in a truly monoclonal tumor, or the presence of
two clonal populations with opposing X-inactivation or allelic
loss patterns, for example). In addition, the potential impact of
sampling error can be considered, since in the uremic group,
for example, about half of the resected glands were not available
to us for DNA analysis. If a certain subset of these glands were
demonstrably monoclonal, then the percentage of patients with
at least one clonal tumor could have risen to 100% (but, of
course, could not fall below the stated 64% even if no additional
glands were monoclonal). Thus, it must be emphasized that
even these impressively and unexpectedly high proportions of
patients bearing abnormal clonal parathyroid tumors may be
underestimates.
Monoclonality implies that somatic mutation of certain
genes controlling cell proliferation occurred in a single parathy￾roid cell, conferring a selective growth advantage upon it and
its progeny. In the present context, our data suggest that emer￾gence of clonal expansions occurs commonly on a background
of true generalized hyperplasia. Conceivably, the heightened
proliferative rate in such hyperplasias increases the tissue's cu￾mulative risk for the mitotic errors of DNA mutation, re￾arrangement, deletion, etc. To cite a possibly related example,
in familial MEN-1, parathyroid tumors exhibiting clonal DNA
losses in the putative MEN-I gene region are common and
might also evolve on a background of true hyperplasia (2, 3).
The complication of clonal emergence may increase the chance
that a clinically silent primary or controllable/reversible sec￾ondary hyperplasia becomes a clinically important disease that
requires surgery. It is also possible that an impaired capacity
for DNA repair, which has been described in uremic patients
(32, 33), further increases the likelihood of clonal transforma￾tion in their parathyroid glands.
Histopathologic criteria have been inadequate for distin￾guishing parathyroid adenoma from hyperplasia (20). Our re￾sults raise the possibility that at least one reason may be that
many hyperplastic glands are monoclonal and in essence are
adenomas. Certainly, our findings highlight the inability of tra￾ditional clinico-pathologic indicators of parathyroid hyperpla￾sia, based upon the existence of multigland disease, to predict
true biologic (polyclonal) hyperplasia.
Some surgeons and pathologists have made a distinction
between nodular and generalized forms of parathyroid hyperpla￾sia, and this was done for our cases of uremic hyperparathyroid￾ism. One key question is whether this controversial descriptive
distinction, based upon gross and histopathologic criteria, re￾flects important biologic or clinical differences among the tu￾mors. Interestingly, while the majority (67%) of our glands
with nodular histology was definitively monoclonal, a majority
(62%) of glands with generalized hyperplasia (no nodular com￾ponent) was also unequivocally monoclonal. Because polyclo￾nality cannot be specified as definitively as monoclonality with
the X-inactivation method, it is possible that our results underes￾timate the true frequency of monoclonality in one or both of
these categories; for example, virtually all nodular cases might
be monoclonal. Obviously, the biological relevance of these
descriptors is dramatically undercut by our finding of frequent
monoclonal neoplasms (likely accompanied by increased func￾tional autonomy) in both histologic categories.
What are the specific genes whose somatic mutation results
in these clonal tumors? Subgroups of parathyroid adenomas
contain rearrangement of the PRADI /cyclin DI oncogene (34-
36) or exhibit loss of a presumed tumor suppressor gene on
llq13 (2) or Ip (37). While PRADI or Ip loci have not been
assessed in parathyroid hyperplasia, Falchetti et al. (5) found
allelic loss of 1lq13 DNA markers, thereby demonstrating
monoclonality, in only 2 of 12 uremic parathyroid glands. We
found no examples of 1 1q13 allelic loss in 18 informative ure￾mic glands, confirming that loss of a chromosome 11 tumor
suppressor gene does not appear to be a common mechanism
underlying what we show here to be the frequent development
of monoclonal tumors in the setting of uremia. In sporadic
primary parathyroid hyperplasia we found that one of four infor￾mative patients exhibited allelic loss at the 1 1q13 loci tested.
Thus, the genetic loci responsible for the frequent monoclonality
we observed in primary and uremic refractory secondary para￾thyroid hyperplasia in large part remain to be identified. Our
novel finding of tumor-specific DNA loss at M27f and other
X-chromosome loci in three independent parathyroid tumors
strongly suggests that somatic inactivation of an X-linked tumor
suppressor gene may contribute to clonal outgrowths in at least
some cases of parathyroid hyperplasia. This putative tumor sup￾pressor gene may have a highly tissue-specific effect, since X￾chromosome allelic losses have been described in only one
other type of tumor, ovarian cancer (38). Additional studies

of X-chromosome loss patterns in our tumor specimens may
eventually help to pinpoint this gene.
Somatic mutation of genes playing a role in the physiologi￾cal control of PTIH synthesis or secretion could also be contrib￾uting. For example, a disturbance of the synthesis or expression
of the vitamin D receptor gene (39) or the recently cloned
calcium-sensing receptor gene (40) could lead to uncontrolled
PTH secretion with clonal outgrowth.
Because the X-inactivation method may underestimate the
extent of monoclonality in any survey of tissues, it is conceiv￾able that virtually all patients with severe uremic secondary
hyperplasia who require parathyroidectomy (and perhaps those
with clinically evident primary hyperplasia) harbor at least one
clonal parathyroid tumor. The development of monoclonal tu￾mor(s) may in fact distinguish this group from the majority of
dialysis patients without refractory disease, in whom regression
of hyperparathyroidism generally occurs after renal transplanta￾tion (41, 42), and from whom, of course, parathyroid tissue
was unavailable for study. Available parameters such as PTH
levels, duration of dialysis, etc., are not useful in making this
distinction. Thus, the observed lack of statistically significant
correlations between our surgical patients' clinical or laboratory
parameters and the finding of monoclonality in their parathyroid
tumor(s) might have been expected. Certainly our results rein￾force the need for studies in which measures of functional auton￾omy like the calcium set-point in cultured cells are assessed
together with the original gland's clonal status.
The cause of hypercalcemia in two of our patients was a
hyperfunctioning autograft to the arm that proved to be a clonal
neoplasm; molecular studies might eventually help in selecting
or excluding particular parathyroid tissues at the time such auto￾grafts are contemplated. It might also become possible to per￾form echoguided fine needle puncture of hyperplastic parathy￾roid glands in uremic patients with severe hyperparathyroidism
to obtain samples for clonality or mutation analyses. Positive
results might permit the clinician to avoid unnecessary, long￾term, and potentially hazardous medical treatment.
In summary, our data indicate that acquired clonal transfor￾mation is a frequent occurrence in the refractory parathyroid
hyperplasia of chronic renal failure and in nonfamilial primary
parathyroid hyperplasia, disease states which have eluded expla￾nation. The widespread and unexpected presence of abnormal
clonal parathyroid tumors in these patients likely plays a central
pathogenetic role and has potential clinical importance.
