Abstract
Background: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are widely accepted techniques to
eliminate small unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Although previous studies labelled thermal ablation
inferior to surgical resection, the apparent selection bias when comparing patients with unresectable disease to
surgical candidates, the superior safety profile, and the competitive overall survival results for the more recent
reports mandate the setup of a randomized controlled trial. The objective of the COLLISION trial is to prove non￾inferiority of thermal ablation compared to hepatic resection in patients with at least one resectable and ablatable
CRLM and no extrahepatic disease.
Methods: In this two-arm, single-blind multi-center phase-III clinical trial, six hundred and eighteen patients with at
least one CRLM (≤3 cm) will be included to undergo either surgical resection or thermal ablation of appointed
target lesion(s) (≤3 cm). Primary endpoint is OS (overall survival, intention-to-treat analysis). Main secondary
endpoints are overall disease-free survival (DFS), time to progression (TTP), time to local progression (TTLP), primary
and assisted technique efficacy (PTE, ATE), procedural morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay, assessment of
pain and quality of life (QoL), cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
Discussion: If thermal ablation proves to be non-inferior in treating lesions ≤3 cm, a switch in treatment-method
may lead to a reduction of the post-procedural morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay and incremental
costs without compromising oncological outcome for patients with CRLM.
Trial registration: NCT03088150, January 11th 2017.

Background
Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy
worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer
related death in developed countries [1, 2]. Approximately
half of the patients will develop colorectal liver metastases
(CRLM). Only 10–15% are considered eligible for partial
hepatectomy (PH), due to (1) an impaired general health
status, (2) a history of extensive abdominal surgery, (3) the
presence of lesions with an unfavourable anatomical loca￾tion or (4) an insufficient future liver remnant to resect all
lesions [3–7]. These patients are usually treated with
chemotherapy and/or thermal ablation, alone or in com￾bination with PH.
Contradictory to most cancer types, long-term survival
and even cure is possible in a subset of patients with CRLM
[8]. Median overall survival (OS) of untreated CRLM (re￾ceiving only symptomatic therapy) is 4.5–12 months [9].
Chemotherapy has improved OS, but OS remains humble
at 15–20 months [10, 11].
Surgical resection of the metastases has long been
considered the only curative treatment option. In the
past few years, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and
microwave ablation (MWA) techniques have rapidly
worked their way into clinical guidelines for treatment
of unresectable liver tumours [12]. For solitary small (<
2 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas, international guide￾lines have shifted from surgery to minimally-invasive
percutaneous thermal ablation because local control
rates have reached 100% [6, 13–17].
Four recent series reported a comparable OS for ther￾mal ablation versus surgical resection [14, 18–20]. These
results have led to the discussion whether or not thermal
ablation – being less invasive – should be favoured over
resection for smaller lesions. Despite this, 5-year OS
(25–55%) of thermal ablation for patients with unresect￾able CRLM has been labelled inferior to surgical resec￾tion for patients with resectable CRLM according to
previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews [21–29].
These results should be interpreted with caution due to
the apparent selection bias. At this point, there are no
high-quality randomized controlled trials comparing
thermal ablation to surgical resection for resectable
CRLM, even though the need has previously been sug￾gested by various authors [8, 30, 31]. To prove
non-inferiority, we have designed a two-arm single-blind
multi-center phase-III randomized controlled trial com￾paring surgical resection (standard of care) to thermal
ablation (experimental arm) for resectable and ablatable
CRLM ≤3 cm.
Design/methods
Design
COLLISION is a national, single-blind, multi-center, phase￾III trial that is organized by the Amsterdam University
Medical Centres (location VUmc) in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. The study is accommodated by the Dutch
Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) and formally endorsed by
the Dutch national covering patient federations, Dutch
national societies for interventional radiology (NVIR),
radiology (NVvR), surgery (NVvH), and the liver sur￾gery working group (WLC).). Patients will be recruited
in, at least sixteen, high-volume centres for liver sur￾gery throughout the Netherlands: Amsterdam UMC
(location VUmc), Amsterdam; Amsterdam UMC (loca￾tion AMC), Amsterdam; Leiden University Medical
Center (LUMC), Leiden; Radboud University Medical
Center, Nijmegen; Maastricht University Medical Cen￾ter (MUMC), Maastricht; Antoni van Leeuwenhoek
(AvL), Amsterdam; Medical Center Leeuwarden (MCL),
Leeuwarden; Ziekenhuis Gelderse Vallei (ZGV), Ede;
Isala Klinieken, Zwolle; Deventer Ziekenhuis, Deventer;
Westfriesgasthuis, Hoorn; Erasmus Medical Center
(EMC), Rotterdam; Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis (JBZ), Den
Bosch; Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST), Enschede;
Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (OLVG), Amsterdam;
University Medical Center (UMCU), Utrecht). The
protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethical
Review Board (METc) of the Amsterdam University Med￾ical Centres (location VUmc) for Dutch national approval
(no. 2016.561). The trial is investigator-sponsored by
Medtronic PLC, independent of industry and registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03088150, January 11th 2017). The
trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki (64th version, October 2013) and the guide￾lines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The in- and exclu￾sion criteria are summarized in Table 1.
The total duration of the study is around 13 years
considering an inclusion time of 3 years and a minimum
follow-up period of 10 years. All participants will pro￾vide written informed consent.The flow diagram of is
shown in Fig. 1.
Start COLLISION trial
Inclusion, randomization and treatments started in two
hospitals by the end of 2017. Due to formal approval
procedures by local authorities, only AmsterdamUMC
(location VUmc) and ZGV Ede were able to include pa￾tients from the beginning. From May 2018, Radbou￾dUMC, LUMC, MCL, Isala Klinieken and Westfries
Gasthuis were also able to participate. Numerous other
Dutch high-volume liver centres, which are mentioned
above, are waiting for local approval and will participate
in the near future.
Eligibility
Potential candidates will be registered and undergo routine
pre-procedural work-up: baseline full blood examination,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), bone marrow, liver, and
Puijk et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:821 Page 2 of 13

renal function -, anaesthetic review, ceCT of the chest and
abdomen and either an upper abdominal ceMRI or a total
body 18F-FDG PET-CT using upper abdominal ceMRI as
problem solver. Patients with ≥1 resectable and ablatable
CRLM (≤3 cm), no extrahepatic disease and a good perform￾ance status (WHO 0–2) are considered eligible. Supplemen￾tary resections for resectable lesions > 3 cm and thermal
ablations for unresectable CRLM ≤3 cm are allowed with a
maximum number of CRLM of 10 (Table 1).
Eligible patients will be stratified into low-, intermedi￾ate- and high disease burden after assessment by an ex￾pert panel (Fig. 1). The panel, consisting of at least two
diagnostic radiologists, two interventional radiologists
and two hepatobiliary and/or oncological surgeons, will
appoint lesions that are resectable and ablatable as target
lesions, resectable and unablatable lesions as unablatable
lesions and ablatable but unresectable lesions as unre￾sectable lesions. All unablatable lesions should be resect￾able and all unresectable lesions should be ≤3 cm and
ablatable. Because definitions of resectability and ablat￾ability can vary dramatically from one center to the
other and from one specialist to the other, the panel has
to agree with the treating physicians’ treatment plan. If
the panel disagrees, the panel and the treating physicians
must reach consensus before the patient can be enrolled.
Methods
Participating centres should have extensive experience in
the field of both hepatic surgery and thermal liver tumour
ablation, defined as performing ≥20 procedures annually.
Treating surgeons and interventional radiologists should
be board certified and have performed and/or supervised
≥100 procedures.
Inclusion
After having obtained written informed consent by the
outpatient clinic doctor, patients will be formally in￾cluded. The patient should be scheduled to undergo the
procedure within a time-frame of maximum 6 weeks
hereafter. Patients suitable for either laparoscopic resec￾tion or percutaneous ablation (Subgroup A, low disease
burden; 1–3 target lesions) will be randomized prior to
the procedure. All other patients will undergo open
laparotomy with surgical inspection of the abdominal
cavity and intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS).
Exclusion (drop-outs)
Despite improvements in preoperative imaging technology,
the intraoperative use of ultrasonography remains of crucial
importance [32]. The detection rate of preoperatively un￾known lesions is still high (up to 50%) with considerable
consequences on treatment strategy [32]. Following surgical
inspection and IOUS the inclusion criteria need to be
reconfirmed prior to randomization. If (1) a radical proced￾ure is no longer considered safe or feasible, if (2) > 10
CRLM are present, if (3) extrahepatic disease is detected, or
if (4) no lesion can be appointed as target lesion, the patient
cannot be included in the study and will be treated as
non-study object. Additional CRLM suitable for both resec￾tion and ablation ≤3 cm will be appointed as new target le￾sions. Additional unresectable lesions ≤3 cm that are
suitable for thermal ablation should be ablated if possible
and vice versa additionally detected unablatable lesions
should be resected. Lesions, preprocedurally appointed as
target lesions, that prove unsuitable for one treatment mo￾dality based on IOUS lose their status and should be treated
with the alternate modality (lesion shifts from target lesion
to unablatable or unresectable lesion).

Laparotomy
The surgical explorative procedure of participants in this
study is identical to standard procedures for non-study
objects. A right subcostal incision is performed. The ab￾dominal cavity will be explored in order to exclude ex￾trahepatic tumour manifestations. An IOUS to exclude
additional CRLM and for final confirmation of resect￾ability will always be performed.
Randomization
Patients with limited disease burden (max. 3 lesions
≤3 cm) that are suitable for percutaneous ablation or lap￾aroscopic resection will be randomized, prior to the pro￾cedure, into one of two arms, arm A and arm B. All other
patients will undergo laparotomy with IOUS and surgical
inspection and will, if still considered eligible, be random￾ized during general anaesthesia. Patients included in study
arm A will undergo resection of hepatic metastases, allow￾ing thermal ablation for additional unresectable lesions.
Patients included in study arm B will undergo ultrasound
guided thermal ablation of hepatic metastases, allowing
resection for additional unablatable lesions (Fig. 1).
Randomization is centralized and performed through a
web-based module (Castor EDC®) [33], which is accessible
7 days a week, 24 h per day]. For open procedures
randomization will be performed shortly after surgical in￾spection and IOUS with the patient under general anaes￾thesia. Both the experimenter(s) and the participant will
be unaware of the eventual treatment arm prior to the
procedure; after the procedure the patient will remain un￾aware (single-blind).Because follow-up imaging will reveal
the nature of the focal therapy and because knowledge
about the actual procedure and pathological confirmation
of tumour free margins is required to reliably assess
18F-FDG PET-CT follow-up scans, the panel’s diagnostic
abdominal radiologists and nuclear physicians need to be
informed about the specific treatment history.
Changes in insights detected after randomization do
not allow patient’s exclusion. These patients will remain
in their originally appointed group according to the
intention-to-treat analysis. For example, if, after being
randomized into the resection arm, a target lesion
proves unresectable during surgical tissue preparation
and dissection, the patient will remain in arm A (resec￾tion) even if the lesion was eventually ablated or left
untreated.
Surgical resection
In case of randomization to surgical resection, the sur￾geon will remove all target lesions as well as all add￾itional unablatable lesions. The extent of the resection,
the resection margins and the specific technique is at
the discretion of the performing liver surgeon. Compli￾cations encountered during the procedure will be noted.
Postoperative care will be on the recovery and subse￾quently on either the surgery ward or medium care
whenever deemed necessary. General ‘resectability’ cri￾teria are shown in Table 2.
Thermal ablation
The safety, feasibility and preferred type of thermal abla￾tion(s) is at the discretion of the interventional radiologist.
Ablations are performed according to the CIRSE quality
improvement guidelines with an intentional tumour free
ablation margin of at least 1 cm [34].
Patients with limited disease burden (max. 3 lesions
≤3 cm) and no contra-indications for a percutaneous
approach will be randomized prior to the procedure.
Contra-indications for a percutaneous approach are prox￾imity of critical structures. To avoid collateral damage to
intestines a minimum distance to the stomach, small
bowel and colon of 15 mm should be respected. Laparo￾scopic approach is allowed. Pneumo- and hydrodissec￾tions are allowed. Pringle-manoeuvres are not allowed.
Following percutaneous ablations, a ceCT or ceMRI
should always be performed for ablated lesions > 2 cm and
for lesions 0–2 cm with radiologically unclear margins after
the ablation. Unequivocal local site residues or insufficient
tumour-free margins should be re-ablated (completion abla￾tion) within 4 weeks after the initial ablation. If re-ablated
within 4 weeks, the residue/insufficient margins count as

technically unsuccessful ablations, but not as a tumour re￾curring event when assessing the primary technique efficacy,
local progression-free and disease-free survival. Patients with
limited disease burden plus a contra-indication for both per￾cutaneous ablation and for laparoscopic surgery and patients
with intermediate or high disease burden will be randomized
during open laparotomy.
The probes are connected to compatible and commer￾cially available generators. Ablations will be performed ac￾cording to the protocols provided by the manufacturers. If
necessary, the needle electrodes will be repositioned for
one or more overlapping ablations. The proximity of a
large portal or systemic vein or hepatic artery is no
contraindication for performing the thermal ablation.
The definition of a technically successful ablation is
based upon the specific protocols established by the de￾vice manufacturers in combination with an immediate
post-procedurally performed US (fully hyperechoic abla￾tion zone with an intentional margin of at least 1 cm)
[7]. Necessity for re-ablations and/or needle reposi￾tioning will be judged by the performing interventional
radiologist. Postoperative care will be on the recovery room
and subsequently on either the surgery ward or medium care
whenever deemed necessary. A quality-control ceCT can be
performed within 1–6 weeks after the initial treatment to as￾sess for a completion-procedure [7]. General ‘ablatability’ cri￾teria are shown in Table 2.
Follow-up
Conferring to national guidelines follow-up will include
imaging, laboratory tests including tumour markers
(CEA) and clinical examination every 3 months for the
first year and every 6 months hereafter. Follow-up
cross-sectional imaging should include at least an abdom￾inal ceCT or upper abdominal ceMRI at the given
time-points. Participating centres are free to add 18F-FDG
PET-CTs at specific time-points or to use alternating spe￾cific modalities, as long as the follow-up protocol is
pre-approved by the trial coordinators and as long as
follow-up imaging is identical for both treatment arms.
Quality of life questionnaires will be assessed at baseline,
every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months here￾after accordingly. Data will be collected in Castor EDC®
[33], only available for related research investigators.
Primary and secondary objectives
The main objective is to prove non-inferiority of thermal
ablation compared to hepatic resection in patients with
at least one resectable and ablatable CRLM (≤3 cm) and
no extrahepatic disease. Primary endpoint is OS. Main
secondary endpoints are overall disease-free survival
(DFS), time-to-progression (TTP), time-to-local-progression
(TTLP), primary and assisted technique efficacy (PTE, ATE),
procedural morbidity and mortality, length of hospital
stay, assessment of pain and quality of life (QoL),
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life
years (QALY).
Pain analysis will be performed using visual analogue
scale questionnaires (VAS) assessed prior to, directly after
and every 3 months after local treatment; administered
pain medication will be registered. Quality of life analysis
will be performed using European Organisation for Re￾search and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life question￾naires (EORTC-QLQ-CR29, EORCT QLQ-C30, EQ-5D)
prior to, and every 3 months after local treatment. Patients
who complete the quality-of life questionnaires at baseline
and at least once during treatment and follow-up will be
included in the analysis. The largest decrease in quality of
life with respect to baseline will be calculated. The
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to detect statistical
differences between the two treatment arms.
Sample size calculation and statistical considerations
We hypothesize (null-hypothesis) that thermal ablation
is non-inferior to surgical resection for the selected patient
groups in terms of the primary objective (OS). The Cox
proportional hazards model (1-sided; non-inferiority or
superiority) is used for sample size calculations (Table 3).
Given the superior safety profile we consider a hazard ratio
(HR) of 1.3 to represent the upper limit of non-inferiority
(non-inferiority margin). An HR of 1.3 corresponds to a
56.5% chance of the ablated patients to die first ((P = HR/
(1 + HR) = 1.3/(1 + 1.3) = 0.565 (56.5%)). We will have
reached 60% of events (death) approximately 6.5 years
after having included the last patient (overall probabil￾ity of event, pE = 0.6). The calculated sample size there￾fore is 599 (NS). To account for a 10% drop-out ratio
(NDO = 69) prior to randomization and a 3% loss to
follow-up (NLTFU = 18) after randomization we need to
recruit 687 patients (NI). A total number of 618 patients
(687–69 (NDO)) will be randomized (NR) into one of two
arms: arm A will undergo surgical resection (n = 309) and

lesions.
Statistical methods
All clinicopathological and procedural variables will be de￾scribed and analysed. Continuous variables will be summa￾rized with standard statistics including, means, standard
deviations, medians and ranges. Categorical variables will
be summarized with frequencies. When appropriate, box
plots and cross tables will be used for descriptive statistics
of continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
P-values below 0.05 will be considered significant. All cal￾culations will be generated by statistical package for social
sciences software (SPSS®). Calculation of the number of pa￾tients that will be needed to address our primary endpoint
with a power of 80% and a 5% type I error rate is described
in the sample size calculation section.
Univariate survival analysis will be performed using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival lengths will
be analysed using the log rank test. To determine hazard
ratios (HR) for multivariate analysis, Cox regression will
be used. Significance of differences for continuous and
categorical data will be analysed using the Mann-Whitney
U test and Chi-square test respectively. When appropriate,
box plots and cross tables will be used for descriptive sta￾tistics of continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
OS will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with
corresponding two sided 95% Cl’s for survival proportions.
Primary and assisted technique efficacy rates (PTE,
ATE) defined as the percentage of target lesions that
have recurred after the initial local treatment and after
additional local treatments regardless of the technique(s)
used to treat the recurrence with a minimum follow-up
period of 12 months after the last focal therapy;- Direct
and indirect total cost of care for both treatment arms
will be registered in the cost-effectiveness data collection
matrix. Based on this matrix a cost–utility analysis, mea￾sured in terms of years of full health lived, using
quality-adjusted life years will be prospectively calcu￾lated. Cost-effectiveness will be expressed as an ICER,
the ratio of change in costs to the change in effects.
Data monitoring
The investigators believe that an independent data safety
and monitoring committee (DSMB) is unnecessary given
the much less invasive nature and superior safety profile
of the experimental treatment arm (thermal ablation).
An independent monitor committee (Clinical Research
Bureau; CRB) is appointed to safeguard the quality of all
investigator-initiated studies. A quality officer from the
CRB will monitor all study data according to Good
Clinical Practice (GCP). The informed consent of se￾lected individual participants will be checked. Source
Data verification will be performed during onsite
monitoring (to verify if all data on the Case Report Form
are in accordance with the source data). The intensity of
this verification is in relation to the risk associated with
the intervention investigated, which is considered ac￾ceptable. For all subjects, the informed consent forms,
the in- and exclusion criteria and the primary outcome
(overall survival from the date of randomization to the
date of death due to any cause) will be verified. The
monitor will also verify if all (S)AE’s are reported ad￾equately and within the time that is determined by legal
rules and regulations.
Shortly after beginning of the study the research group
and epidemiologists will compose a detailed plan regard￾ing futility and criteria to end the study prematurely.
The interim analysis will be performed on the primary
endpoint using a non-inferiority analysis. If at interim
analysis, after having randomized 30% of the patients,
the number of deaths due to treatment is significantly
higher in patients included in the experimental arm B
compared to patients included in the control arm A, the
study will be ended prematurely. If the interim analysis
shows a trend towards a type 1 or type 2 error, we will
add a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) to our
study. A new interim analysis will be conducted after
having randomized 50% of the patients.
(Serious) adverse events (AE’s and SAE’s) and serious
adverse device effects (SADE)
All serious adverse events that occur in the first 90-days
after the procedure that are life threatening or result in
death, both related and unrelated to the research, and
serious adverse events that happen during complete
study follow up, that are life threatening or result in
death and are related (unlikely, possible, probable or def￾inite) to the research according to one of the principal
investigator, will be reported within 7 days after the re￾sponsible investigator has first knowledge of the adverse
reaction. This is for a preliminary report with another
8 days for completion of the report. Relationship of the
event to the research will be established by the primary
investigator as: 1 = Unrelated (clearly not related to the
research), 2 = Unlikely (doubtfully related to the re￾search), 3 = Possible (may be related to the research), 4
= Probable (likely related to the research), 5 = Definite
(clearly related to the research). All participating clini￾cians will be made aware of the necessity to report (ser￾ious) adverse events to the principal investigators. The
sponsor will report the SA(D)E’s through the web portal
ToetsingOnline.nl to the accredited EC that approved
the protocol, within 15 days after the sponsor has first
knowledge of the serious adverse events.
The expedited reporting will occur not later than 7 days
after the responsible investigator has first knowledge of the

adverse event. This is for a preliminary report with another
8 days for completion of the report.
The sponsor (also) has an insurance which is in ac￾cordance with the legal requirements in the Netherlands
(Article 7 WMO and the Measure regarding Compul￾sory Insurance for Clinical Research in Humans of July
1st, 2015). This insurance provides cover for damage to
research subjects through injury or death related to
study participation.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
General considerations For this clinical trial, a cost
effectiveness (utility) analysis will be performed from a
societal perspective, using a 3-year time horizon. The
direct and indirect costs will be included. Direct costs
taken into account will include treatment costs, cost of
hospitalization, medication, imaging, laboratory testing
and pathology.
Within the trial, resource use will be monitored and
this will be linked to integral cost prices or Dutch tariffs.
Patient outcome analysis To assess indirect cost, pa￾tients will be asked to fill out the Productivity and
Disease Questionnaire (PRODISC) every 6 months. To
calculate total indirect costs, the friction cost approach
will be used.
Cost analysis the primary health outcome measure in
this economic evaluation will be the total quality ad￾justed life years (QALY) per trial arm. QALYS will be
calculated by using the utility scores linked to the vari￾ous health states of the EQ-5D; in essence the length of
time a patient spends in a particular health condition is
weighed by the corresponding utility. Missing data on
costs and utilities will be imputed using multiple imput￾ation. The difference in total costs and total QALYs in
both arms will be used to calculate the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): the cost per QALY gained
(or cost-savings per QALY gained or lost), using the
formula: ICER = (Cintervention - Ccontrol)/(QALYinter￾vention - QALYcontrol). Cost and health effect will be dis￾counted using the Dutch discount rates of 1.5% for health
effects and 4% for costs. In addition, to allow comparison
with international studies, discount rates of 3% for both
health effects and costs will be used as well. To assess the
impact of uncertainty, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis
will be performed using the non-parametric bootstrap
with 5000 replications. The results will be presented on
cost-effectiveness planes. In addition, ICER acceptability
curves will be presented and univariate sensitivity analyses
will be performed focusing on uncertainty around most
important costs-items.
Dissemination policy
To ensure optimal implementation we used the frame￾work of Fleuren et al. [35]; consisting of patient,
innovation, organization and socio-political determinants.
Although clinical equipoise between surgery and ablation
is reached for small CRLM, the results from recent
meta-analyses, such as the most recent one by Meijerink
et al. [36], do not support thermal ablation for resectable
CRLM outside clinical trials. Hence, patients suitable for
COLLISION will have to choose between surgery (+/− ab￾lation for unresectable CRLM) and trial participation.
With 15.549 new cases of colorectal cancer in the
Netherlands (2015) approximately 4% of them will have
≥1 resectable and ablatable CRLM [1]. At this moment,
these lesions are treated by resection, whilst ablation
may be associated with less complications and an equal
or even superior oncological outcome. In other words,
in the Netherlands alone an estimated target population of
625 patients per year should be eligible for COLLISION
trial participation. To further facilitate implementation the
trial is formally supported by the following concerning pa￾tient federations who joined the trial advisory board: The
Dutch Federation for patients with cancer (NFK), the
Dutch society for patients with gastro-intestinal and
hepato-, pancreatico-, biliary cancers (SPKS) and the Dutch
society for image-guided treatment of cancer (SBBvK).
The study is embedded within the multidisciplinary
Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG). DCCG is a
collaboration between medical disciplines that are rele￾vant for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer
(surgical oncology, radiotherapy, medical oncology, path￾ology, radiology, gastroenterology, genetics). Patients will
be recruited throughout the country and treated in one
of the qualifying and selected high-volume centres. We
will ensure that the scientific community, patients and
professional organizations will be constantly kept up to
date on the obtained results.
In order to qualify for reimbursement the Dutch
health care institute (ZiNL) demands the best available
evidence. Currently, thermal ablation is only approved
for truly unresectable and small CRLM. Outside the set￾ting of the trial ablations of resectable CRLM are
off-guideline and hence not reimbursed. The direct and
indirect costs of thermal ablation are considerably lower
than that of surgery. We expect even lower indirect
costs for patients treated within the study, primarily be￾cause thermal ablation of resectable CRLM in patients
who by definition qualify as suitable for surgery may be
associated with an even lower complication-rate.
Discussion
The recently published primary efficacy rates (complete
ablation after the first procedure) of RFA and MWA for
small CRLM have approached the reported resection
Puijk et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:821 Page 8 of 13

plane recurrence rates for similar sized lesions [6]
, [14–
17], [21]. Hence the issue of ablation site recurrences,
that has previously prevented its widespread adoption,
may be outdated. The relative ease to percutaneously
re-ablate potential site recurrences, nowadays in the set￾ting of a one-day admission under conscious sedation,
has further downgraded its relevance.
Partial hepatectomy
Until relatively recent, patients with CRLM could only
be cured by surgical resection of the lesions. Although
no formal upper limit regarding number and size of
CRLM has been established, surgical resection is now￾adays considered safe and effective for patients with an
adequate performance status if radical resection will
leave sufficient future functioning liver parenchyma. In
addition, one of the three main hepatic veins must be
uncompromised and the liver remnant has to comprise
a portal vein, hepatic artery and a bile duct. Clear defini￾tions of what is regarded as resectable are lacking and
vary dramatically from center to center on the basis of
aggressiveness of the surgical team and the perception of
the medical oncologist on when to refer patients [37].
To achieve consensus several societies for surgical on￾cology and hepatobiliary surgery have previously
attempted to postulate resectability criteria (Table 2) [38,
39]. The objective of surgical resection for CRLM should
be to remove all macroscopically visible tumour tissue
with the intent to achieve cure. Histological tumour free
margins and hence the confirmation of having radically
resected the metastases remains essential.
Surgical resection has a 5-year OS reaching 31–58%
[3, 40]. Although the number of serious adverse events
of hepatic resection has decreased considerably in the
past two decades, the 90-day mortality (4%) and the
complication-rate (40%; major plus minor) are still high
[41–43]. In 2007 data from 1059 non-cirrhotic patients
who underwent major hepatectomy were analysed [43].
The total percentage of complications was 453 (43%), di￾vided as follows: minor complications 26% (grade I 7%;
grade II 19%) and major complications 17% (grade IIIa
10%, grade IIIb 2%, grade IVa 4%, grade IVb 1%). Most fre￾quently encountered complications include per-operative
major bleeding, bile duct/gallbladder injury, perforation of
adjacent structures, intra-abdominal infection, wound
infection, liver abscess, haematoma at incision site,
pneumothorax, liver failure and death (4%) [41, 42].
Radiofrequency ablation
Since its introduction in the late 90’s, RFA is the most
studied and widely adopted ablative technique. It has
emerged as a promising approach in the treatment of
patients with unresectable CRLM. RFA has acquired its
role in the treatment of patients with unresectable
CRLM as a safe, well tolerated, easily repeatable and less
invasive procedure [44, 45].
One major drawback of RFA is the heat-sink effect in
highly perfused organs, such as the liver where a large
tumour located near large vessels (> 3 mm diameter) is
not properly treated because heat is lost to the flowing
blood. Another risk of RFA is heat injury to vital struc￾tures in or surrounding the ablated area. For this reason,
treatment of lesions in the proximity of other organs,
large vessels and major bile ducts has to be performed
with caution, and is sometimes contra-indicated [46].
The 90-day mortality of thermal ablation alone is very
low (< 1%) and the complication rate is also low (6–9%)
[6]. Applied to unresectable CRLM, 5-year survival rates
are approaching the results reported after surgical resec￾tion, especially for patients presenting with a limited
number of small-size lesions. The reported 5-year OS is
25–55% [21–29]. The recently presented long-term re￾sults from the only available randomized controlled trial
shows a survival plateau of 36% after 8-years in patients
with unresectable CRLM [6]. It is important to realize
that these percentages are derived from studies where
thermal ablation was used to treat unresectable lesions.
Ruers et al. found a PFS of 16.9 months (95%CI 11.7–
22.1) in a group of patients who received chemotherapy
plus RFA (HR 0.63 [95%CI 0.42–0.95]). Of those 56 pa￾tients treated with RFA, 9 developed a local site recur￾rence (LSR) (16,1%) [6].
Complications can be divided into three different
groups: related to probe placement (bleeding 0,7%, infec￾tion, tumour seeding 0–0,3%), related to energy delivery
(damage to bowel, gallbladder, bile ducts 4,2%, ground￾ing pad burns, post-ablation syndrome, hepatic vascular
damage, liver failure 2,1%) and related to the general
procedure (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embol￾ism, referred pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, kidney fail￾ure) [47].
Microwave ablation
MWA is known as ablative technique for tissues with a
high percentage of water and has several theoretical ad￾vantages that may result in improved performance near
blood vessels. Due to a much broader field of power
density, MWA results in a larger zone of active heating.
This increased zone allows for a more homogeneous
zone of tumour cell death, both within the targeted zone
and next to blood vessels. This feature is thought to
make MWA less affected by heat sink. Recent develop￾ments in the field of MWA, employing higher frequency
bands (2.45 GHz) or spatial energy control (thermal,
field, and wavelength), claim to create more predictable,
larger and more spherical ablation zones regardless of
target location, tissue type or changes in tissue proper￾ties during the ablation [48].
Puijk et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:821 Page 9 of 13

Several studies reported a 3-,4- and 5-year OS for
MWA between 35 and 79%, 35–58% and 17–18%
[15, 16, 49–54]. M7ortality is ranging between 0 and 2%
[15, 49, 50]. The median DFS ranges between 8 and
12 months [15, 50, 54]. Overall recurrence ranges between
39 and 72% [15, 17, 50, 51, 55, 56]. In several observa￾tional studies complications ranged between 0 and 54%
[15, 16, 50, 55–57]. No studies reported the effect on
quality of life after MWA.
Partial hepatectomy versus thermal ablation
Numerous studies reported OS rates for surgery and
thermal ablation techniques. Comparing RFA alone to
surgery alone numerous observational studies reported
corrected hazard ratios for OS between RFA and surgery
alone; treatment with RFA was associated with an infer￾ior OS (HR = 1.92; 95%CI 1.44–2.56) [22, 23, 25, 27, 58–
61]. Comparing RFA plus surgery to surgery alone other
studies reported corrected hazard ratios and allowed for
pooling between surgery and surgery plus RFA; no sig￾nificant difference in OS was found (HR = 1.29; 95% CI
0.71–2.327) [14, 18, 61, 62].
For MWA, a 3-year OS of 23% after surgery and 14%
after MWA has been reported [54]. Another study
showed a 4-year OS of 70% after surgery and 41% after
MWA, although no formal statistical comparison with
surgery alone was reported [53]. A more recently pub￾lished study found 5-year OS rates for surgery versus
percutaneous ablation as first intervention of 51.9 and
53%, with a median OS of 65.0 (95%CI 47.3 to 82.6) and
62.1 (95%CI 52.2 to 72.1) months, respectively [19].
Another study reported no significant difference in OS
for MWA plus surgery versus surgery alone (3-year OS:
50.9% vs 48.8%) [63]. Median OS was 39 months after sur￾gery and 28 months after MWA plus surgery. In multi￾variate analysis MWA was no prognostic factor for OS.
Several studies revealed that complications were sig￾nificantly more common after surgery compared to RFA
(relative risk [RR] = 0.47; 95%CI 0.28–0.78) [22–29, 59,
64–66]. Two studies reported serious adverse events in
21–28% after surgery vs 13–37% in the surgery + abla￾tion group [18, 24].
Some studies compared RFA to surgery alone regarding
local progression-free survival (LPFS) and DFS; RFA was
inferior to surgical resection (+/− RFA) [25, 28, 58]. Com￾paring RFA plus surgery to surgery alone, RFA plus sur￾gery was associated with a poor LPFS [14, 18, 24, 58, 61].
Assessing DFS, no significant difference between RFA +
surgery vs surgery alone was found.
In conclusion, a recently published systematic review
and meta-analysis reported that further randomized assess￾ments of thermal ablation with curative intent to
current-day palliative chemotherapy alone should be con￾sidered unethical [36]. Therefore, the highest achievable
evidence level for unresectable CRLM seems to be reached.
According to above mentioned superior safety profile,
lower complication-rate and competitive long term
survival after thermal ablation for CRLM challenges liver
surgery and fiats the setup of this randomized controlled
trial. If thermal ablation for resectable CRLM proves to be
non-inferior to surgery, a reduction of the post-procedural
morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay and incre￾mental costs can be expected, with better quality of life
and without compromising oncological outcome.
