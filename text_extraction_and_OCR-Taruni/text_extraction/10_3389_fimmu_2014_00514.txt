Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the
pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tis￾sue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode,
they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector
cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage dif￾ferentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of
a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting
for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When
monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific
functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some
of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to
react as naïve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages con￾serve a “memory” of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some
of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and
macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.

INTRODUCTION
In the healthy organism, the innate immune system provides the
first line of defense against external or internal danger signals, by
initiating a protective inflammatory response that develops during
time through different phases, from initiation and full inflamma￾tion, to resolution and re-establishment of tissue integrity. The
first phase of an inflammatory response is aimed at destroying
pathogens, and is followed by a phase in which dead and dying
cells, damaged extracellular matrix material, and cellular debris
are removed, to end up with a recovery phase in which the tissue
is repaired and restored to a healthy fully functional condition. In
fact, if the defense against harmful threats is a priority for avoiding
tissue damage, maintaining homeostasis (i.e., maintaining tissue
morphology and tissue function) is the ultimate goal of a tissue
in multicellular organisms (1). In this perspective, inflammation
presumably evolved as an adaptive response to tissue malfunction
or homeostatic imbalance (2). Thus, while the disease state is a dis￾placement from homeostasis, inflammation is the tissue response
for restoring homeostasis. However, since the inflammatory activ￾ities are potentially harmful to the host, these need to be tightly
controlled to avoid excessive tissue damage (3).
The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) plays major roles
in development, scavenging, inflammation, and anti-pathogen
defenses, both by the direct elimination of foreign agents and
in organizing each different phase of the inflammatory process
(4). Under the term, MPS are grouped lineage-committed bone
marrow precursors, circulating monocytes, resident macrophages,
and dendritic cells (DC) (5). The development, homeostatic
maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and function of the
MPS are regulated by the growth factors colony-stimulating fac￾tor (CSF)-1 and interleukin (IL)-34, the second ligand for the
CSF-1R (6, 7).
The issue of heterogeneity in the MPS still leads to a confusion
and debate about DC as truly distinct cells from macrophages,
with separate lineage and functions (8). In fact, macrophages and
myeloid DC possibly represent alternative differentiation options
of bone marrow progenitors and blood monocytes (9), with over￾lapping functions and marker expression. Reviewing this issue
is beyond the scope of this essay [we refer the reader to recent
excellent reviews on the topic; (9–11)], and will only focus on
monocytes and their relationship with macrophages.
The traditional view of the MPS suggests that recruited mono￾cytes (that become macrophages in tissues) are key players during
inflammation and pathogen challenge, whereas tissue-resident
macrophages have important roles in development, tissue home￾ostasis, and the resolution of inflammation. A basic concept of
the MPS is that blood monocytes are precursors that replace tis￾sue macrophages within a single developmental lineage (4). This
dogma needs now to be revised in the light of new evidence that
macrophages are endowed with self-renewal capacity and can pop￾ulate tissues before birth, deriving from early hematopoiesis in the
yolk sac (12, 13). The discovery of new macrophage progenitors
of embryonic origin forces us to reassess definitions, functions,
and cell–cell relationships within the MPS. We can synthesize it in
three key new questions:
1. Are monocytes more than circulating precursors and can they
have effector functions?
www.frontiersin.org October 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 1

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
2. Is there a functional difference between the monocyte-derived
macrophages and the yolk sac-derived self-renewing resident
macrophages?
3. What is the relationship between monocytes and macrophages
and which are their mutual roles in different phases of
inflammatory reactions?
Another new perspective arises from the description of
macrophage polarization, i.e., the ability of macrophages to
acquire different functional phenotypes, enabling them to steer
adaptive immunity in different directions. This highlights the
central role of macrophages in immune defense, overturning
the long-held notion that macrophages need to be activated by
T-cells (14).
This review will summarize what has been so far investigated
and established on monocyte/macrophage biology, highlighting
what remains outstanding, and which questions are still unan￾swered. We will consider key studies that have been carried out in
mice, with reference to the human situation when data are avail￾able. We will review the various aspects (monocyte recruitment,
monocyte functions, macrophage polarization) before (homeo￾static conditions), during (inflammatory reaction), and after a
damaging event (resolution/repair).
MONOCYTES
MONOCYTE DEVELOPMENT AND HETEROGENEITY
Monocytes are a group of cells circulating in the blood, bone
marrow, and spleen, and constituting ~10% of the total leuko￾cytes in human beings and only 2–4% in mice. They have typi￾cal morphological features, such as irregular cell shape, oval- or
kidney-shaped nucleus, cytoplasmic vesicles, and high cytoplasm￾to-nucleus ratio. Monocytes can remain in the circulation for up
to 1–2 days, after which time, if they have not been recruited into
a tissue for facing a danger, they die and are removed. Mono￾cytes originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) and develop through a series of sequential differentia￾tion stages: the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) (15), the
granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) (15), the common
macrophage and DC precursor (MDP) (16), and finally the com￾mitted monocyte progenitor (cMoP), a recently identified bone
marrow precursor that differs from MDP as it lacks CD135 expres￾sion (17). MDP gives rise also to common DC progenitors (CDP),
whose differentiation potential is restricted to the DC lineage
(18). Monocytes have been considered as the systemic reservoir
of myeloid precursors for renewal of tissue macrophages and DC.
However, many DC and macrophage subpopulations [for exam￾ple, lymphoid organ DC, plasmacytoid DC, skin Langerhans cells
(LC), and brain microglia] originate from the MDP independent
of monocytes (11, 18), and in some cases, they can even develop
directly from the bone marrow (19).
Homeostatic control of monocyte/macrophage development is
mostly influenced by CSF-1 (also known as M-CSF), produced by
stromal cells within the blood and in tissues (20). Mature mononu￾clear phagocytes in turn express CSF-1 receptors (CSF-1R) and
remove circulating CSF-1, allowing a feedback loop responsi￾ble for monocyte proliferation decrease (21, 22). Recently, the
cytokine IL-34 has been identified as able to bind and signal
through the CSF-1R (6, 23). Unlike broadly expressed CSF-1,
IL-34 expression is restricted to the epidermis and central ner￾vous system (24), where it supports the steady-state proliferation
of macrophages (LC and microglia, respectively). Granulocyte￾macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is another fac￾tor involved in the development of mononuclear phagocytes but
only during the inflammatory state and not under homeostatic
conditions (25, 26).
Abundant experimental evidence indicates that recruited
monocytes are innate effectors of the inflammatory response to
microbes, and they kill pathogens via phagocytosis, production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), myeloperox￾idase, and inflammatory cytokines (27). In some circumstances,
monocytes can trigger and polarize T-cell responses (27, 28) and
may also contribute to angiogenesis and atherogenesis (29).
Human peripheral blood monocytes are not a homogeneous
population. Monocyte heterogeneity was first reported with
the identification of a minor population of CD16 (FcγRIII)-
expressing cells within circulating human monocytes (30). In
recent years, investigators have identified three functional sub￾sets of human monocytes, the characterization of which is still
in its infancy. Likewise, it is still unclear which are the specific
roles that they exert in homeostasis and inflammation in vivo,
in comparison with those of the previously described classically
and alternatively activated macrophages (see below). The new
nomenclature that groups monocytes into three subsets, based
on the expression of the surface markers CD14 and CD16, has
recently been approved by the Nomenclature Committee of the
International Union of Immunologic Societies (31). Based on
this nomenclature, the major population of human monocytes
(90%) with high CD14 but no CD16 expression (CD14++CD16−
or CD14+CD16−) are termed classical monocytes, whereas the
minor population of human monocytes (10%) is further sub￾divided into the intermediate subset, with low CD16 and high
CD14 (CD14++CD16+ or CD14+CD16+), and the non-classical
subset, with high CD16 but with relatively lower CD14 expression
(CD14+CD16++ or CD14dimCD16+) (31). In this review, we refer
only to the main difference, terming classical monocytes simply as
CD14+, and non-classical as CD16+.
Over the recent years, an increasing amount of knowledge
has been gained in the field of monocyte subpopulations. Many
authors demonstrated that the three subsets express different tran￾scriptomes (32–38), although discrepancies between studies were
evident. These discrepancies may be due to differences in cell isola￾tion methodology and in the purity of the cell populations isolated,
and the microarray methodologies, which use different amounts
of total RNA for the hybridization, different probes to identify
the genes, and even distinct solid supports for the probes (39).
However, there is stronger agreement for the proximity of rela￾tionship between the intermediate and non-classical monocyte
subsets, while the classical subset is the most distant subset (36).
The close relationship between intermediate and non-classical
monocytes suggests a direct developmental relationship between
them, although this has yet to be formally proven. Also, it needs to
be clarified how the characteristics previously ascribed to CD16+
monocytes are distributed between intermediate and non-classical
subsets (36). Recent data suggested a sequential developmental

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
relationship between the two subsets based on the observation
that, in time course studies in inflammatory diseases, an increase
in the intermediate monocytes is followed by an increase of
non-classical monocytes (40).
The physiological role of the monocyte subsets in vivo is not
fully defined. They might have different roles during the home￾ostasis, immune defense/inflammation, and tissue repair, in terms
of their capacity to become activated and secrete inflammatory
cytokines in response to different stimuli, antigen processing and
presentation, pro-angiogenic and patrolling behavior. The phe￾notypic and functional differences between the monocyte sub￾sets were recently discussed in an exhaustive review (41). The
authors of this review report a complete and referenced list
of studies on bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune dis￾eases, and inflammatory conditions, in which an expansion of
CD16+ cells in respect to other subsets has been observed. In
general terms, both human classical and intermediate monocytes
have inflammatory properties reminiscent of the murine Ly6C+
monocytes (also termed “inflammatory” monocytes) (42), while
non-classical monocytes display patrolling properties similar to
those of murine Ly6C− monocytes (also termed “alternative” or
“patrolling” monocytes) (43). Both human and mouse inflam￾matory monocytes express high levels of the chemokine receptor
CCR2 and low levels of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, whereas
patrolling monocytes show a reverse pattern. Accordingly, inflam￾matory monocytes respond to the chemokine CCL2 that mediates
Ly6C+/CD14+ monocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites (44),
while patrolling monocytes respond to CX3C-chemokine ligand
1 [CX3CL1, the human fractalkine and mouse neurotactin; (45)],
a chemokine present both as soluble protein and as membrane￾bound chemokine form that is expressed on endothelial cells and
in tissues. Overall, it is clear that the subsets between human being
and mouse are similar but not identical (42, 46). Table 1 summa￾rizes the main features of monocytes in human beings and mice.
Of note, there is a clear difference in the proportion of the two
monocyte subsets, as Ly6C− cells represent about half of the circu￾lating monocytes in mice, whereas CD16+ monocytes account for
less than 15% in human beings (30). However, Ziegler-Heitbrock
hypothesized that the higher proportion of the Ly6C− in mouse
blood could be due to stressful blood drawing (cardiac puncture
under terminal anesthesia) that mobilizes these monocytes from
the marginal pool (46). This hypothesis still needs experimental
proof.
To date, a relevant question that is still open concerns the origin
of the various monocyte subpopulations. It should be kept in mind
that the majority of current knowledge derives from mouse stud￾ies. It is unknown if the monocyte subpopulations are end stages of
different differentiation paths of a common precursor, or whether
they represent subsequent maturation stages in a common path of
differentiation, where the intermediate subset could be a pheno￾typical and/or developmental intermediate between the classical
and non-classical subsets. The latter hypothesis seems to be the
most reliable. While initial studies suggested that Ly6C+ cells were
recruited under inflammatory conditions and did not serve as pre￾cursors to Ly6C− cells [which in turn were originally considered
the immediate precursors of resident macrophages; (43)], recent
evidence suggests that, in steady state, Ly6C+ monocytes are pre￾cursors of Ly6C− monocytes (48, 49), as shown in experiments in
which grafted Ly6C+ monocytes spontaneously differentiated into
Ly6C− in the blood of recipient mice (48). This conversion can also
occur in the bone marrow, where Ly6C+ monocytes apparently
return in the absence of inflammation (47–49). More recently, it
has been suggested that CSF-1R signaling was required for the
maturation of monocytes from Ly6C+ to Ly6C−, as blockade of
this receptor leads to decrease in the number of Ly6C− cells, short￾ens their lifespan (48), and concomitantly increases the number
of Ly6C+ monocytes (50).
It has also been observed that development of the Ly6C− popu￾lation depends on the transcription factor NR4A1 (Nurr77) (51).
NR4A1 deletion alters the number of Ly6C− monocytes in the

bone marrow but not in blood or spleen (52), but does not alter
the number of macrophages within tissues (53). This suggests that
either Ly6C− monocytes can develop from MDP within the bone
marrow, or that Ly6C− monocytes are a functional end stage. In
this regard, given that Ly6C− monocytes exhibit a long steady-state
half-life of 5–7 days [which in the absence of their renewal from
Ly6C+ monocytes can extend to 2 weeks; (48)] compared to ~8 h
for Ly6C+cells, Ly6C− monocytes might be considered as termi￾nally differentiated blood-resident macrophages or “vasculature
macrophages,” rather than bona fide monocytes (48). Indeed, the
primary function of these cells seems to be that of patrolling the
vascular endothelium and monitoring its integrity (45, 51). Con￾versely,and in parallel with human CD14+ cells,Ly6C+ monocytes
because of their short half-life are unlikely to have other functions,
and thus are more likely to be the direct precursors of the tis￾sue macrophages/peripheral mononuclear phagocytes described
in the original MPS model.
FUNCTION OF MONOCYTE SUBSETS DURING HOMEOSTASIS
(CLASSICAL VS. ANTIGEN-PRESENTING TISSUE MONOCYTES VS.
PATROLLING MONOCYTES)
The original concept of MPS implicated that classical mono￾cytes are recruited in the tissue to become tissue-resident
macrophages in homeostatic conditions, and inflammatory acti￾vated macrophages during an infection (27, 54). We will examine
more in detail the role of recruited cells during the inflamma￾tory response later, while here we will focus on the recruitment of
monocytes in homeostasis and their contribution to maintaining
the pool of tissue macrophages. In order to avoid misunderstand￾ings, it is important to agree on the definition of monocyte. In
our view, bona fide monocytes are restricted to the blood com￾partment, and to the bone marrow and spleen (55), where they
wait to be released in the blood. For obvious reasons, in both
these compartments, monocytes should not initiate any inflam￾matory reaction, but they must be ready to be recruited into
the blood first and subsequently to all organs and tissues. A
phenomenon was recently reported, termed “anticipatory inflam￾mation,” whereby Ly6C+ classical monocytes are released from
the bone marrow in diurnal rhythmic waves under the control
of circadian gene Bmal1 (or Arntl) (56) to provide an adequate
innate response to environmental challenges that are expected
to occur with a evolutionarily predicted frequency. Despite new
evidence supports the view that Ly6C+ classical monocytes are
not precursors of resident macrophages in all tissues and dur￾ing certain types of inflammation (see below), it is clear that
circulating monocytes contribute to the repopulation of tissue￾resident macrophages under homeostatic conditions in tissues
like the lamina propria of the small intestine and healthy skin.
Studies based on functional and lineage tracing and adoptive
transfer have revealed that Ly6C+ monocytes are precursors of
intestinal macrophages that have a short half-life of only 3 weeks
(57–59). Conversely, in the dermis are present both resident der￾mal macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (60, 61). A
recent work suggests that the number of macrophages is partially
replenished by monocytes also in the heart (62) and in the lung
(63). It is unknown why some tissue macrophages are constantly
maintained by circulating monocytes, whereas other populations
are independent on circulating monocytes (see below). The notion
that monocyte-derived macrophages derive from Ly6C+ cells sug￾gests that the repopulation/maintenance of resident macrophages
in steady-state conditions follows the same mechanism as that
occurring during inflammation.
The function of Ly6C+ monocytes in circulation remains
poorly defined. In the attempt to identify an effective role of
monocytes in the blood in homeostatic conditions (besides being
precursor cells), a recent work has suggested a distinct surveil￾lance phenotype for Ly6C+ monocytes (64). These monocytes
can enter non-lymphoid organs without obligatory differentiation
into macrophages or DC. The authors propose that these mono￾cytes can upregulate MHC class II expression and subsequently
recirculate to lymph nodes, where they are able to present antigens
to T-cells. Considering that these cells retain a monocyte-like gene
expression profile, the authors term them “tissue monocytes” (64).
This study contributes to revising the role of circulating mono￾cytes, suggesting that they are not only precursors of macrophages
but also effector cells.
Regarding the role of the Ly6C− subset in the blood in steady￾state conditions, intravital microscopy studies have established
that these cells display a “patrolling” phenotype, being able to
crawl on the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium (45,
51). This patrolling behavior, along with the ability to phagocy￾tose endothelial-associated particles, suggests that a primary role
of these monocytes is sensing and scanning the endothelial surface
for damage and/or the presence of pathogens (51). The patrolling
monocytes mainly respond via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to local
danger signals (while they are poorly responsive to bacterial prod￾ucts such as LPS) by producing inflammatory mediators (51). They
are able to induce the intravascular recruitment of neutrophils,
which trigger endothelial necrosis, and subsequently they clear the
resulting debris (51). A similar patrolling feature and TLR7/TLR8-
dependent reactivity were also detected in human CD14+CD16++
monocytes (35).
Consistent with their functional role of surveillance of the
endothelium integrity and with the fact that they are terminally
differentiated cells, we agree with the view that Ly6C−/CD16+
can be considered as the tissue-resident macrophages of the blood.
Regarding their ability to produce inflammatory factors, we specu￾late that the patrolling monocytes have a higher activation thresh￾old than Ly6C+ monocytes; therefore, they should be able to
produce an amount of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
sufficient for coordinating the repair of a damaged endothelium,
but not enough to initiate a strong inflammatory reaction.
A summary of the roles of monocyte subsets in steady state vs.
inflammatory conditions is reported in Table 2.

EMBRYONIC ORIGIN VS. MONOCYTE DERIVATION
Resident macrophages are heterogeneous and versatile cells found
in virtually all tissues of adult mammals, where they can represent
up to 10–15% of the total cell number in quiescent conditions.
This number can increase further in response to inflamma￾tory stimuli. The specialization of macrophages in particular
microenvironments explains their heterogeneity. Macrophages

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
take different names according to their tissue location, such as
osteoclasts (bone) (see Box 1), alveolar macrophages (lung),
microglial cells (CNS), histiocytes (connective tissue), Kupffer
cells (liver), and LC (skin). These populations have such highly
different transcriptional profiles that they could be considered
as many different and unique classes of macrophages (74). On
the other hand, the functions of macrophages are the same in
all tissues. They are key players in tissue development (by shap￾ing the tissue architecture), in immune response to pathogens (by
generating and resolving the inflammatory reaction), in surveil￾lance and monitoring of tissue changes (by acting as sentinel and
effector cells), and especially in maintenance of tissue homeostasis
(by clearing apoptotic or senescent cells, and by remodeling and
repairing tissues).

The view that tissue macrophages originate from circulating
peripheral blood monocytes that migrate into tissues under a vari￾ety of stimuli, proposed and strongly supported by van Furth in
the 1970s (4, 75, 76), needs to be reconsidered. In addition to
a wealth of old data (77, 78), two new pieces of evidence have
further weakened the view that monocytes are the precursors
of tissue macrophages in steady-state conditions: (1) the find￾ing of the macrophage origin from embryonic progenitors that
seed developing tissues before birth and give rise to fetal tissue
macrophages (79) and (2) the self-maintaining ability of tissue￾resident macrophages through local proliferation in adulthood
(13). The latter finding will be discussed hereafter.
Two main phases of embryonic hematopoiesis have been
described in the mouse: primitive hematopoiesis and definitive
hematopoiesis. The former takes place in the ectoderm of the
yolk sac and gives rise to macrophages without going through
a monocytic progenitor. The latter takes place in the fetal liver,
which is initially seeded by hematopoietic progenitors from the
yolk sac and subsequently by HSCs from endothelium of the
aorta-gonads-mesonephros (80, 81). The fetal liver subsequently
becomes the source of definitive hematopoiesis that generates cir￾culating monocytes during embryogenesis. Spleen and bone mar￾row are also colonized via the circulatory system by hematopoietic
progenitors that will ultimately differentiate there. After birth,
upon bone formation, hematopoiesis passes from the fetal liver
to the bone marrow. The definitive bone marrow hematopoiesis is
the source of both Ly6C+ and Ly6C− circulating monocytes, from
which resident tissue macrophages were thought to derive (10).
The human embryonic hematopoietic system is organized
roughly in the same way as in the mouse (82), and early studies
propose that macrophages could arise in the embryo independent
of bone marrow progenitors in human beings [for more extensive
reading, see Ref. (83, 84)]. In summary, macrophages in fetal and
adult tissues derive from at least three sources: yolk sac (giving rise
to some tissue-resident yolk sac-derived macrophages), fetal liver
Box 1 A hint on osteoclasts.
Osteoclasts are multinuclear giant cells with a hematopoietic origin, commonly known as bone macrophages.They function in bone resorp￾tion and are involved in a normal skeletal development, growth, and modeling, for the maintenance of its integrity throughout life, and for
remodeling through calcium metabolism (65). Moreover, osteoclasts are able to interact with the hematopoietic system and the adaptive
immune system (66). Excessive bone loss mediated by osteoclasts plays a major role in certain pathologic conditions, such as rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and osteoporosis (67, 68). On the other hand, insufficient bone resorption due to the lack of functional osteoclasts (as in CSF-1R
knock-out mice) leads to excessive bone apposition and osteopetrosis (69).
Osteoclasts really seem a class of macrophages on their own. They are generated from mononuclear phagocyte lineage progenitors in the
bone marrow, and their differentiation from an osteoclast precursor (PreOC) depends on CSF-1 and the engagement of receptor activator
of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL), a specific osteoclast differentiation factor (70). Recently, it has been shown that also
IL-34 is involved in the osteoclast development (71).
Osteoclasts can differentiate in vitro from a cell population named monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs), which seem to originate
from circulating CD14+ monocytes (72). In vitro induction of MOMCs from circulating CD14+ monocytes apparently requires their binding
to fibronectin, and exposure to soluble factor(s) derived from peripheral blood CD14dim monocytes (72).
Thus, culture of unfractionated peripheral blood monocytes with M-CSF and RANKL is sufficient to induce their differentiation into
osteoclasts, and it has been assumed that osteoclast precursors are monocytes, although this has not been shown in vivo.
The question arises as to why osteoclasts, unlike other macrophages, have their own lineage of commitment and differentiation. Possibly,
the reason may lie in the fact that they are phylogenically closely linked to the presence of bone, a tissue that develops late as com￾pared to other organs and tissues during embryonic/fetal development, as in fact vertebrates are the most recent phylogenic step in the
evolution (73).

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
(giving rise to fetal liver-derived macrophages), and bone marrow
(giving rise to tissue-resident bone marrow-derived macrophages
and inflammatory bone marrow-derived macrophages, see below)
(Figure 1). The primitive yolk sac-derived macrophages have
two distinct characteristics: (1) their pattern of differentiation
does not go through a monocytic intermediate state but they
directly become mature macrophages in fetal tissues (85) and
(2) unlike macrophages derived from definitive c-Myb-dependent
hematopoiesis, they are independent of the transcriptional factor
c-Myb during development, while depending on the transcrip￾tional factor PU.1 (12).
Based on different experimental approaches, from lineage trac￾ing (12, 48) to experiments carried out in parabiotic mice (64,
86), it is evident that monocytes do not contribute or con￾tribute only minimally to the maintenance of peripheral tissue￾resident macrophages in steady-state conditions in many adult
tissues. Fate-mapping experiments have shown that the adult
microglial cell population is exclusively derived from yolk sac
progenitors (87, 88), whereas for LC in adult skin it was clearly
demonstrated a mixed origin, from the yolk sac and from the
fetal liver (12, 89). Moreover, using Myb-deficient mice that
lack development of HSCs, followed by transplantation with
genetically dissimilar bone marrow together with fate mapping,
it has been observed that yolk sac macrophages can generate
macrophages with a characteristically high expression of the F4/80
marker (F4/80 bright macrophages) in brain (microglia), skin
(LC), liver (Kupffer cells), pancreas, and spleen (12). In kid￾ney and lung, tissue-resident macrophages have a double origin,
encompassing F4/80high macrophages, derived from yolk sac, and
F4/80low macrophages, which have a hematopoietic origin and are
continuously replaced by bone marrow-derived progenitors (12).
Moreover, F4/80high shares a common gene signature with yolk sac
macrophages, unlike F4/80low cells, as shown by global transcrip￾tional analysis (12). Also, for splenic red pulp macrophages, alve￾olar, and peritoneal macrophages, an embryonic origin has been
confirmed, rather than a monocyte origin (48). All these experi￾ments show that early embryonic progenitor-derived macrophages
can persist in tissues to adulthood. As mentioned previously, an
exception is the gut, which contains a large population of resi￾dent macrophages that are all blood monocyte-derived cells, in
steady-state conditions (57). How the mutual contribution of yolk
sac-derived macrophages and fetal liver-derived monocytes is reg￾ulated in each tissue is unknown, and likewise it is not known
how these two distinct populations of macrophages are func￾tionally and ontogenically related. Regarding how much yolk sac
progenitors contribute to originating adult tissue macrophages vs.
fetal liver hematopoiesis, there are different opinions. One hypoth￾esis is that fetal liver-derived monocytes proliferate and differen￾tiate into adult tissue macrophages markedly diluting the popula￾tion of yolk sac-derived macrophages (e.g., in lung and heart). This
hypothesis stems from the observation that generation of yolk sac￾derived macrophages does not go through a monocytic intermedi￾ate, therefore being in contrast with normal adult hematopoiesis,
while a fetal liver origin for tissue macrophages would be reminis￾cent of the adult scenario in inflammation (90). Conversely, others
believe that all tissue macrophages derive from yolk sac during the
embryonic development, and circulating monocytes do not seed
the majority of the adult tissues in mice (except kidney and lung)
(12, 91) (Figure 2). This concept is strengthened by findings in
human beings, where a complete loss of CD16+ monocytes seems
to be of little consequence (92), and many tissue macrophage pop￾ulations appear to be intact in patients with monocytopenia caused
FIGURE 1 | Origin of tissue-resident macrophages in the mouse. In adult
tissues, macrophages derive from three sources. The first is the yolk sac in
the embryo, where primitive hematopoiesis occurs giving rise to progenitors
that seed tissues with F4/80high macrophages. Later during fetal development,
hematopoiesis shifts from the yolk sac to the fetal liver (that seems to
contribute to the LC pool in the skin, possibly through a yolk sac-derived
progenitor). It is unknown whether other resident macrophages in other
tissues may also derive from fetal liver hematopoiesis. The third source is the
bone marrow, where definitive hematopoiesis occurs in the fetus and in the
adult, giving rise to monocytes and to monocyte-derived F4/80low
macrophages. Expression of murine F4/80 (the human EMR1) is an
insufficient marker to discriminate between monocyte-derived macrophages
and tissue-resident macrophages. It seems that Ly6C+ monocytes are the
precursors of tissue macrophages, while the exact contribution of Ly6C−
monocytes remains unclear. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; GMP,

contribution to resident macrophages is highly tissue-dependent and varies

monocyte origin for intestinal lamina propria macrophages. The tissues

main text), and for which a mixed contribution is probable. Here, we define

by immune deficiency syndromes (93, 94). In conclusion, to which
extent different populations of yolk sac-derived macrophages may
be later replaced by fetal liver-derived macrophages or monocytes,
and how yolk sac-derived tissue-resident macrophages can prolif￾erate locally through life to maintain their own pool independently
of adult monocyte input, these issues remain a matter of debate
(90, 91, 95). Thus, three main issues arise from all these findings:
1. The origin of adult macrophages in steady-state conditions can
vary considerably between tissues.
2. The exact role of the patrolling Ly6C− monocytes remains
unclear, while Ly6C+ monocytes are recruited predominantly
to sites of infection or injury, or to the organs and tissues that
have continuous cyclic recruitment of macrophages (such as
the uterus), or that are exposed to microbiota (such as the gut
and the skin).
3. Due to some limits and weaknesses of the published studies
(whole blood irradiation or other myelo-ablative treatments,
parabiotic mice, engrafted bone marrow or monocytes, adop￾tive transfer of radiolabeled cells, Cre-loxP-based fate mapping,
CCR2 or CSF-1 inactivation, etc.) (9, 90), none of such studies
provides conclusive evidence against a role for monocytes in
tissue macrophage homeostasis. Thus, more efficient and spe￾cific fate-mapping models of yolk sac-derived macrophages and
fetal liver-derived monocytes are needed, along with further
investigation, to determine which tissue macrophage popula￾tions are constantly replenished by circulating monocytes and
which are not.
SELF-RENEWAL/PROLIFERATION CAPACITY OF TISSUE-RESIDENT
MACROPHAGES IN HOMEOSTASIS
Given that it is currently not possible to discriminate the
two populations of tissue macrophages (yolk sac-derived and
monocyte-derived) during homeostasis, we will report their ability
to proliferate without considering them as distinct subpopula￾tions. In any case, we will bear in mind the notion that the tissue
macrophages can maintain their number in the absence of mono￾cyte precursors both in steady-state conditions (12, 48, 64, 86) as
well as in genetically or experimentally monocytopenic situations
(94, 95).
It is important to clarify the difference between self-renewal
and proliferative capacity. As stated by Sieweke and Allen (13), in
immunology, self-renewal is understood as a replacement of a cer￾tain cell population, while in stem cell research as the capacity to
generate with a cell division a daughter cell showing the same iden￾tity as the parental cell. Local proliferation of tissue macrophages
can be considered as self-renewal in both senses [see Ref. (12,
13)], since macrophages can proliferate without change of their
differentiated phenotype (96). Having said that, recent evidence
demonstrated that macrophages within the adult tissues self-renew
via proliferation in homeostatic conditions rather than through an
influx of progenitors. This has been shown for LC, which are able
to proliferate (97) both in human beings (98) and in mice (99),
for brain microglia (19), resident peritoneal macrophages (100),
and alveolar macrophages (101). The self-renewal process is regu￾lated by growth factors and cytokines such as CSF-1 and GM-CSF
(Box 2).
Resident macrophages can proliferate at low levels in steady￾state conditions, but proliferation rates strongly increase after
macrophage depletion (86) or under inflammatory challenge (13).
Regarding their proliferative ability, Ginhoux and Jung (90) raise
the interesting question as to “whether all macrophages within
a tissue possess equal self-renewal potential, or whether there
are macrophage subpopulations that differ in their capacity of
survival and proliferation, which would imply the existence of
macrophages subpopulations with stem cell-like features.” The
question arises from observations that physiological or experimen￾tal depletion of LC leads to a clonal expansion of LC by adjacent
proliferative cell clusters with stem cell-like features (120), and
that among lung macrophages, different cells can proliferate to
maintain the population (87). To solve this issue, there is evi￾dence that a macrophage that had previously divided has the same
probability of entering the cell cycle as a cell that had not, sug￾gesting the same proliferative ability for all macrophages (87).
This is consistent with the observation that macrophages geneti￾cally modified to have an indefinite self-renewal potential can be
efficiently cloned (96).
During inflammation, things are quite different, espe￾cially because the tissue is enriched with monocyte-derived
macrophages. We will discuss later the replenishment of tissue
macrophages by monocyte-derived macrophages and their ability
to proliferate.

the main body tissues. These functions, mirroring different phe￾notypes (74, 143), are specific because depending on different

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
Box 2 Factors driving monocyte/macrophage self-renewal, proliferation, and functional differentiation.
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also known as CSF-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) drive
the monocyte/macrophage development, differentiation, and proliferation along with cytokines such as IL-4 (102) and the recently discov￾ered IL-34 (103). Macrophages and circulating monocytes express the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) (42, 43), and mouse deficient in CSF-1R
(osteopetropic mice, op/op) have a decreased number of monocytes in the bone marrow and in circulation, in addition to a decrease in
osteoclasts (69, 104). Experimentally blocking CSF-1R with antibodies leads to a reduction in Ly6C− monocytes (69) and to an associated
increase in Ly6C+ monocytes, suggesting the involvement of CSF-1 in the maturation of monocytes from Ly6C+ to Ly6C− (48, 104). CSF-1 is
constitutively produced by mesenchymal cells (105) and is detectable in circulation in resting conditions (20). Under homeostatic conditions
(106), CSF-1 promotes monocyte development and macrophage proliferation (107), which is controlled in a negative feedback loop. In fact,
mature mononuclear phagocytes express high level of CSF-1R and are responsible for the clearance of CSF-1. The decreased CSF-1 levels
lead to a decrease in mononuclear cell proliferation, thereby maintaining the cell number to normal levels both systemically and locally [(21,
22); a model of CSF-1-dependent local homeostasis of macrophage density has been described by Jenkins and Hume (9)]. Thus, elevated
production of CSF-1 can drive both an increased proliferation of resident macrophages and an increased recruitment of monocytes (103, 108)
via macrophage production of CCL2 (109). CSF-1 deficiency in mice affects distinct tissues by different degrees, ranging from marked cell
loss in the gut, kidney, peritoneal cavity, and in circulation, as compared to liver (86). CSF-1 is also involved in the proliferation of splenic red
pulp macrophages and bone marrow macrophages (110). GM-CSF is also critical for macrophage homeostasis and proliferation, especially
in the lung (111) and in the peritoneal cavity in vivo (112), but it is less important in hematopoiesis, and, therefore, for monocyte development
(113). GM-CSF can support monocyte expansion and differentiation in vitro (25, 114), and it seems to be mainly involved in induction of
hematopoiesis during inflammation rather than in homeostasis (115, 116). CSF-1 and GM-CSF are also involved in monocyte/macrophage
functional differentiation programs: CSF-1 stimulation leads to a homeostatic or anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype (25, 117, 118), whereas
GM-CSF leads to an M1-like inflammatory phenotype (25, 117–119). Thus, CSF-1 stimulation represents a default homeostatic/M2 pathway
of monocyte development (119). In summary, CSF-1 is mainly involved in self-renewal of tissue macrophages, consistent with its role in
M2 polarization, while GM-CSF is involved in proliferation of monocyte-derived inflammatory macrophages, consistent with its role in M1
polarization.

bone marrow (10), phenotypes that are necessary for the tissue￾specific needs of defending, maintaining, and regaining home￾ostasis (144). These homeostatic functions may be altered by
chronic insults, which may lead to an anomalous prolonga￾tion/amplification of the macrophage attempt to regain homeosta￾sis and to a consequent causal association between macrophages
and diseases (Table 3). In pathological conditions, the distinction
between tissue-resident macrophages and recruited inflamma￾tory macrophages has not yet been possible. For an in-depth
analysis of these issues, the reader can refer to recent exhaustive
reviews (99, 144, 145). Apart from tissue-specific functions, tissue
macrophages share a series of common functions encompass￾ing clearance of cell debris, immune surveillance, wound healing,
defense against pathogens, and the initiation and resolution of
inflammation. In this review, we will only focus on the role of
macrophages in inflammatory responses, considering their capac￾ity to polarize into different functional phenotypes in response
to the tissue microenvironmental changes that occur during the
different phases of an inflammatory response. This polarization
process is based on the M1–M2 paradigm (see below).
PLASTICITY OF MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES DURING
INFLAMMATORY REACTION
MONOCYTE RECRUITMENT DURING THE INFLAMMATORY REACTION:
INFLAMMATORY MONOCYTE-DERIVED MACROPHAGES VS.
TISSUE-RESIDENT MACROPHAGES AND THEIR PROLIFERATIVE ABILITY
During the first phases of an inflammatory reaction, there is
in the tissue an increase of the effector cell number, necessary
for increasing the immune defensive firepower. These cells are
monocyte-derived macrophages. The concomitant drastic loss of
resident macrophages, due to tissue adherence, emigration, or
death, is a phenomenon termed “the macrophages disappearance
reaction” (146), and it is especially evident for peritoneal and alve￾olar macrophages. To cope with the need of increasing the number
of effector cells, two strategies come into play.
First is the recruitment of blood monocytes, driven by resident
macrophages alongside with other tissue cells. Recruited blood
monocytes are a source of inflammatory macrophages, which
take the name of bone marrow-derived or monocyte-derived
inflammatory macrophages. The other strategy is the increase of
tissue-resident macrophage proliferation by enhancement of their
self-renewal ability.
Central to the issue of monocyte recruitment is the difference in
monocyte subset trafficking. Such differences have been observed
to occur during acute and chronic inflammation in mice, and
underline the fact that the monocyte subsets are under the con￾trol of distinct trafficking mechanisms, with the classical subset
being recruited via CCR2 and the non-classical one utilizing a
CXCR1-dependent pathway (see Box 3).
In a model of Listeria monocytogenes infection, non-classical
monocytes (Ly6C−) extravasate rapidly within 1 h, invade the sur￾rounding tissues, and develop a very early inflammatory response
by producing chemokines responsible for recruiting other effec￾tors cells (granulocytes, NK cells, T-cells), and cytokines such
as TNF-α (central to macrophage-mediated inflammation and
innate responses) (45). This inflammatory response is transient,
and 8 h after infection, the main producers of inflammatory
cytokines in the tissue are the classical monocytes (Ly6C+). As
Box 3 Chemokines and monocyte recruitment mechanisms.
The two main chemokines and related receptors involved in the inflammation-dependent recruitment of the Ly6C+ and Ly6C− monocyte
subsets from the blood, bone marrow, and spleen, are CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1, respectively (45, 46). Fibroblasts, epithelial, and
endothelial cells produce CCL2 in response to inflammatory cytokines or microbial molecules, and generate a high level of this chemokine
in the inflamed tissue (to allow egress of monocytes from the blood and entry in the tissues) and/or in blood (to allow entry of bone marrow
monocytes) (44, 147). Recently, it has been proposed that both mesenchymal cells and progenitor cells closely apposed to bone marrow
vessels can produce CCL2 in inflammatory situations, to allowing the egress of monocytes from the tissue and their subsequent entry
into the blood (148). During a bacterial infection, Ly6C+ monocytes require CCR2 for being recruited from the bone marrow into the blood
(149). In mice lacking CX3CR1, a reduction of patrolling by Ly6C− was observed (45), and a reduction of their number in infracted heart
(150), suggesting an impaired recruitment from the blood. Genetic destruction of CCR2 reduces the accumulation of both Ly6C+ and Ly6C−
monocytes in injured skeletal muscle, but it does not alter the recruitment of Ly6C− monocytes in the heart after myocardial infarction
(150). A reduction was also observed in skin wounds on the first day from injury, when Ly6C+ cells are those principally involved in the early
repair phases, but not during the late stage of tissue repair, when Ly6C− cells are dominant (151). These studies underline the importance
of monocyte recruitment from blood to the tissue in the injured cardiac or skeletal muscle. Regarding the role of in situ differentiation,
in addition to the data mentioned above (150), a reduction of Ly6C− monocytes has been observed also in the blood of CCR2-deficient
mice, despite the fact that they do not express this receptor (48). Macrophage accumulation in skin wounds is also reduced in mice lacking
CX3CR1 (152). CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 provide a survival or anti-apoptotic signal to Ly6C− cells (153). Two models have been proposed for
the CCL2-dependent Ly6C+ cell recruitment from the bone marrow: CCL2 increases monocyte chemokinesis and contact with blood ves￾sels; CCL2 associates with tissue glycosaminoglycans and forms a gradient driving monocytes to exit the bone marrow for entering into
circulation (54). Intravenous administration of CCL2 leads to the mobilization of monocytes into the circulation, which is consistent with a
role for peripheral CCL2 production responsible for replenishment of circulating monocytes from bone marrow (154).
Under steady-state conditions, the release of Ly6C+ and Ly6C− monocytes from bone marrow depends on two genes, the circadian clock
gene Bmal1 for Ly6C+ cells (55), and the G-coupled receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate S1PR5 for Ly6C− monocytes (155). In mice with
myeloid cell-restricted Bmal1-deficiency, the rhythmic release of CCL2 was ablated along with monocyte pools.Thus, myeloid cells produce
low diurnal levels of CCL2 in a circadian fashion, and CCL2 in turn stimulates the release of CCR2-expressing monocytes from the bone
marrow into the blood. On the other hand, in S1PR5-deficient mice, Ly6C− monocytes are retained in the bone marrow and are not released
in the blood and spleen.

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
previously mentioned (45), it has been observed that the two
subsets of monocytes differentiate into two distinct cells types.
Ly6C− patrolling monocytes initiate a macrophage differentiation
program that resembles that of M2 macrophages (see below), while
Ly6C+ monocytes differentiate into DC-like cells that resemble
Tip-DC (45). However, in other systems, this double recruit￾ment of different monocyte subsets has not been observed. Only
Ly6C+ monocytes were observed to migrate to the injured tis￾sue in a model of skeletal muscle injury and be responsible for
early inflammatory responses (156). Generally, classical mono￾cytes infiltrate inflamed tissues more robustly than their non￾classical counterparts, and their number is significantly increased
in the circulation during systemic or chronic infection (27). After
engulfing dying cells in the tissue, the recruited classical mono￾cytes differentiate into cells that resemble Ly6C− monocytes, and
become involved in tissue repair mechanisms (156). Likewise, in
a mouse model of sterile wound (subcutaneous polyvinyl alco￾hol sponge implantation), it has been recently demonstrated that
Ly6C+ monocytes recruited from the circulation into the skin
acquired an inflammatory function and, despite time of mat￾uration was long, they matured into Ly6C− macrophages with
repair functions (157). Yet, another situation is that of myocar￾dial infarction, during which both monocyte subsets appear to
home to the same tissue at different stages of inflammation
(150). Specifically, the Ly6C+ subset first infiltrates the infracted
heart and exhibits inflammatory functions, while the Ly6C− sub￾set is recruited at a later stage and promotes tissue healing by
expressing high amounts of vascular endothelial growth fac￾tor, exhibiting angiogenic capacity, and promoting deposition of
collagen (150).
In atherosclerosis, as a model of chronic inflammation, both
monocyte subsets are recruited at the same time to the acti￾vated endothelium/plaques, and healing seems to be correlated
with a reduction in total monocyte recruitment (158). However,
it was recently demonstrated that the maintenance and accumula￾tion of monocyte-derived macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques
mainly depend on local proliferation of bone marrow-derived
macrophages rather than on the influx of circulating monocytes
(127, 159). In an atopic dermatitis model and in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a massive proliferation of LC and
microglia cells has been observed (160, 161), despite a signifi￾cant monocyte influx (161). In the peritoneal cavity and in the
lung, where the macrophage disappearance phenomenon occurs
upon bacterial and virus insults, the few remaining macrophages
are responsible for repopulating the tissue (86, 101, 106). Sim￾ilarly, in the context of Th2-mediated immunity against nema￾tode infection, IL-4 drives tissue-resident macrophage expansion
in the pleural cavity in the absence of peripheral monocyte
recruitment (102).
Proliferation of macrophages is observed in a variety of human
diseases [see Ref. (91)], including tumor-associated macrophages
in solid tumors (162), and adipose tissue-associated macrophages
in obesity (163).
In this context, a question is still open. Having established
that monocytes are recruited into tissues during an inflamma￾tory event, to what extent are they capable to differentiate in
tissue macrophages and to proliferate? As proposed by Jenkins
and Hume, the negligible contribution of monocytes to the pool
of resident macrophages could be due to the fact that mono￾cyte recruitment is specifically aiming at providing a population
of functionally differentiated cells needed for resolving an acute
inflammatory event, rather than being triggered by the home￾ostatic need of maintaining the autonomous pool of resident
macrophages (9). This view is supported by another interesting
hypothesis, i.e., in inflammatory conditions, monocyte-derived
macrophages are mostly end-type killer cells, as the non-specific
toxic molecules they produce will also cause their own death (164).
The gastrointestinal tract provides evidence in favor of this
hypothesis. In the gut, blood monocytes are constantly recruited
to the tissue where they contribute to maintaining the resi￾dent macrophage population, but during an inflammatory event
they re-program their differentiation plan toward adopting an
inflammatory phenotype (57, 165).
Thus, we should consider that monocyte-derived macrophages
adopt different and opposing phenotypes based on microenvi￾ronmental signals. Adoption of a phenotype or another depends
on the time by which the sequential waves of recruited Ly6C+
monocytes reach the tissue during the course of the inflamma￾tory reaction, since the incoming monocytes will find a different
microenvironment in different phases of the reaction. In this con￾text, it is conceivable that monocytes entering the tissue at later
times could find conditions favorable to adopting an M2-like phe￾notype (see above), thereby becoming tissue macrophages over
time.
Inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (12, 86) and tis￾sue monocytes (64) can be phenotypically and functionally distin￾guished from resident macrophages in many tissues. In the central
nervous system, inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages
do not contribute to the resident population (161). In con￾trast, fate-mapping experiments revealed that monocyte-derived
macrophages recruited to the peritoneal cavity upon thioglycol￾late injection differentiate into resident macrophages and persist
over time (48). The fraction of monocyte-derived macrophages
that do not die upon inflammation and become tissue-resident
macrophages share gene profiling with resident macrophages (45,
64, 165), but there is no information as to whether they are
functionally different or not.
The accumulation of inflammatory monocytes in an inflamed
tissue is due to their influx from blood rather than by their prolif￾erative ability, and in fact inflammatory signals of microbial origin
generally prevent their proliferation. An exception to this general
paradigm comes from a recent study that has demonstrated that
also inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can prolifer￾ate at certain stages during the resolution of zymosan-induced
peritonitis (106).
All these findings are summarized in Figure 3.
Finally, two issues should be reminded:
1. The precise nature and extent of the contribution of monocyte￾derived macrophages to tissue macrophages could depend on
how, and to which extent, inflammation or its cause has affected
the tissue-resident macrophages. In this view, as proposed by
Ginhoux and Jung (90), tissue-resident macrophages are more
involved in tissue macrophage repopulation after mild injury,

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
FIGURE 3 | Schematic representation of monocyte and macrophage
populations in homeostasis and inflammation. Under homeostatic
conditions (left panel), Ly6C+ monocytes derive from the bone marrow and
circulate via the blood into the tissue. A minor fraction of these cells lose
Ly6C expression and become Ly6C− monocytes in the blood or in the bone
marrow where some of them might return in the absence of inflammation.
Ly6C+ blood monocytes enter tissues and become either macrophages, for
example, in the gut, lung, and dermis (monocyte-derived macrophages or
monocyte-derived tissue-resident macrophages). Some tissue
macrophages derive directly from yolk sac during the embryogenesis (e.g.,
LC, microglia, liver Kupffer cells, and alveolar macrophages), are long lived,
and are mainly maintained by self-renewal (tissue-resident macrophages).
Ly6C− monocytes act as resident macrophages of the vasculature,
patrolling, and monitoring the endothelial surface in the blood vessel lumen.
In the figure, the presence of “trained” macrophages is also considered,
which we define as “memory macrophages,” i.e., the tissue macrophages
that retain the memory of a previous inflammation and are in a quiescent
state in the tissue. During an inflammatory reaction (right panel), the
number of blood Ly6C+ monocytes recruited to an inflamed tissue increases
considerably. The large majority of these cells gives rise to the inflammatory
monocyte-derived macrophages, while some of them do not differentiate
into macrophages and remain monocyte-like cells, are able to take up
antigens, and to migrate to the draining lymph nodes (tissue monocytes).
These are the antigen-uptaking and -presenting cells of the tissue. During
inflammation, all macrophages (tissue-resident macrophages,
monocyte-derived tissue macrophages, inflammatory monocyte-derived
macrophages) are activated and differentiate into M1-like inflammatory cells
following interaction with pathogenic and damaged signals/insults in
surrounding microenvironment. These cells produce a series of cytokines
and other inflammatory factors. Tissue-resident macrophages increase their
capacity of proliferation to compensate the loss of macrophages caused by
the inflammatory reaction. Recent evidence demonstrates that also
inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages are able to proliferate in a late
phase of the inflammatory reaction. Memory macrophages are important
players in the inflammatory reaction, as they can react to inflammatory
stimuli with a faster and stronger inflammatory cytokine production. The role
of circulating Ly6C− cells during an inflammatory reaction is not fully
identified. They probably remain in the blood vessels as sentinels, and in
some cases they could enter in the tissue, as it has been reported in the
case of myocardial infarction, to take up a repair function. HSC,

while monocyte-derived macrophages are more involved in
severe inflammatory injuries.
2. In the mouse it seems that non-classical monocytes contribute
to the resident macrophage population. It is possible (although
there is little evidence in this respect) that when non-classical
monocytes are recruited in the inflamed tissue, they may differ￾entiate into alternatively activated macrophages, while classical
monocytes would give rise to classically activated macrophages.
In this context, the developmental relationship between the
different monocyte subsets and the different macrophage func￾tional phenotypes has yet to be fully and formally proven. No
evidence in this sense has been generated yet in human being
(see below).
MACROPHAGE DIFFERENTIATION AND FUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPES
Macrophage polarization occurs through different activation pro￾grams by which macrophages carry out their defensive functions.
In this way, macrophages become able to respond with appro￾priate functions in distinct contexts, functional diversity becom￾ing the key feature of these cells. Essentially, macrophages can
modify their metabolic functions from a heal/growth promoting
setting (M2 macrophages), to a killing/inhibitory capacity (M1
macrophages) (145, 166). The main difference between these cells
is that in M2 macrophages the arginine metabolism is shifted to
ornithine and polyamines, while in M1 cells it is shifted to NO
and citrulline (166). M2-produced ornithine can promote cell
proliferation and repair through polyamine and collagen synthe￾sis, fibrosis and other tissue remodeling functions (167), while
M1-produced NO is an important effector molecule with micro￾bicidal activity and cell proliferation inhibitory capacity (168).
Interestingly, polyamine production per se has been reported to
be a driver of M2 polarization (169), and M2 is the normal
“default” program adopted by resident macrophages (170). More￾over, M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct features in terms
of chemokine production profiles (171), and iron and glucose
metabolism (172, 173).
The description of macrophages polarization is leading immu￾nologists to take a step back and revise their concept on how
the immune system works (14, 145). The M1 and M2 defi￾nition was formulated by mirroring the Th1/Th2 polarization
concept. However, this definition might be misleading in that
it may suggest that Th1/Th2 cells do instruct M1/M2 polar￾ization, whereas it is now obvious that the reverse is true, i.e.,
macrophages are initiating and directing T-cell polarization. Since
it has been shown that distinct populations of macrophages pro￾mote and control CD4+ T-cell-dependent type 1 and type 2
immune inflammatory responses (i.e., those against viruses and
bacteria, and against multicellular parasites, respectively), not
surprisingly they have been termed M1 and M2 (166). Thus,
considering that macrophages recognize pathogens directly (174,
175), while T-cell do not, and considering that T-cells prolif￾erate through interaction with macrophages (176), it is logical
to think that macrophages are the cells that initiate and direct
T-cell response, and that the adaptive immune response needs
the triggering and guidance of innate immunity (14). Notably,
M1 and M2 macrophage activities do not need the presence of
lymphocytes (145). The fact that T-cell-derived cytokines such
as IFN-γ and IL-4 may amplify macrophage polarization (see
below) should not deceive us into believing that macrophage
polarization cannot occur without lymphocytes, as this is not
the case. In vitro, macrophages are activated toward an M1 func￾tional program by infectious microorganism-related molecules
(e.g., the gram-negative product LPS) and by inflammation￾related cytokines TNF-α or IFN-γ, alone or in combination. M1
macrophages are characterized in vitro by an IL-12hiIL-23hiIL￾10lo phenotype; are efficient producers of toxic effector molecules
(ROS and NO) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF, IL￾6); participate as inducers and effector cells in polarized Th1
responses; and mediate resistance against intracellular parasites
and tumors (177). Conversely, M2-like polarization has been
observed in vitro in response to the Th2-related cytokines IL-4
or IL-13 (178), to the concomitant triggering of Fcγ receptors
and Toll-like receptors (TLR), to immune complexes, and to
anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, TGF-β, and gluco￾corticoids (115). The variety of functional programs adopted by
macrophages in response to the stimuli listed above has been
termed M2a (IL-4 and IL-13; alternative inflammation), M2b
(immune complexes, FcγR/TLR triggering), and M2c (IL-10, TGF￾β, glucocorticoids; deactivation) (178, 179). M2 cells are charac￾terized in vitro by an IL-12loIL-23loIL-10hiTGF-β
hi phenotype and
generally have high levels of scavenger, mannose, and galactose￾type receptors. In general,these macrophages take part in polarized
Th2 responses, allergy, parasites clearance, dampening of inflam￾mation, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immunoregulation, and
tumor promotion (180).
Macrophage taxonomy is an attempt to rationally categorize an
extended variety of cell functions. Indeed, the M1/M2 paradigm
is a limited attempt to define the complexity and plasticity of
mononuclear phagocytes. In vivo, macrophages can adopt a vari￾ety of functional phenotypes depending on subtle and continuous
changes in the tissue microenvironment. So, the M1/M2 polariza￾tion of macrophage functions may be taken as a simplified con￾ceptual framework describing a continuum of diverse functional
states, of which M1 and M2 activation states are not ontogeni￾cally defined subsets but represent the extremes (180–182). In this
regard, Mosser and Edwards (181) have suggested a macrophage
classification that takes into account the three functions of these
cells in maintaining homeostasis: host defense, wound healing,
and immune regulation. Classifying macrophages according to
these functions provides three basic macrophage populations:
classically activated macrophages, wound-healing macrophages,
and regulatory macrophages (183, 184). The authors believe that
this classification also helps to illustrate how macrophages can
evolve to exhibit characteristics that are shared by more than one
macrophage population (181).
Without going into details [for which we refer the reader
to other reviews; (14, 185)], the M1/M2 classification in differ￾ent subsets can create the illusory perception of a heterogeneity,
which is not proven to exist in vivo. Thus, as already mentioned
above, it is logical to hypothesize that the subsets are varying mix￾tures of M1- and M2-type macrophages, as observed in the lung
and in the peritoneal cavity, where tissue-specific variations in
the balance of M1- and M2-type responses have been revealed
(74, 186). This situation has also been observed in pathological
Frontiers in Immunology | Inflammation October 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 12

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
conditions, where macrophages can develop mixed M1 and M2
phenotypes (187, 188). Moreover, it has also been proposed to con￾sider the heterogeneity of macrophage functions as a consequence
of interaction with different immunological pathways (e.g., inter￾action with different growth and survival factors, interaction with
lymphoid and myeloid cytokines, interaction with pathogens, res￾olution), rather than attributing them to distinct macrophages
subsets (185).
In summary, the initial inflammatory response is carried out
by activated macrophages in classical or alternative modality
(depending on the triggering events), aiming at eliminating invad￾ing microbes by promoting the inflammatory response. Then, the
resolution phase is carried out by macrophages in deactivated
modality, unresponsive to inflammatory stimuli, and active in the
elimination of the injured cells and tissue components, in pro￾moting angiogenesis, cell proliferation, matrix deposition, and in
general in tissue remodeling. The mechanisms that account for
macrophage deactivation play a key role in maintaining home￾ostasis and keeping the immune response under control (189).
Both innate and adaptive signals can influence the macrophage
functional phenotype, which can have potentially dangerous con￾sequences if not appropriately regulated. For example, classically
activated M1 macrophages can cause damage to host tissues,
predispose surrounding tissue to neoplastic transformation and
influence glucose metabolism by promoting insulin resistance.
Macrophages that are normally involved in wound healing can
promote fibrosis, exacerbate allergic responses, and be exploited by
pathogens for intracellular survival. These M2-type macrophages
can contribute to the progression of neoplasia by promoting tumor
survival (see Table 3).
CURRENT HYPOTHESIS ON MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION
Plasticity and flexibility are key features of macrophages and of
their activation states. A controversial issue is whether a pheno￾typic and functional evolution of macrophages occurs in vivo, and
how it happens. As mentioned above, it has been observed in mice
that the M1 to M2 switch during the progression of the inflamma￾tory response enables macrophages to perform different activities
in the different phases of the reaction. The controversy refers to
the mechanisms underlying this switch, i.e., whether M1 and M2
macrophages are phenotypically distinct subpopulations that can
serve different functions in different phases of an inflammatory
reaction (45, 150), or the same cells can shift from one to another
functional phenotype in response to microenvironmental signals
(156, 157).
Several hypotheses are attempting to explain the issue. A first
hypothesis is that different subsets of monocytes or macrophages
can adopt a different functional phenotype. Thus, Ly6C+ mono￾cytes and/or monocyte-derived macrophages in the tissue become
M1 macrophages, and Ly6C− monocytes and/or tissue-resident
macrophages become M2 macrophages. It is possible that resi￾dent macrophages maintain cytoprotective and reparative func￾tions, whereas macrophages derived from circulating inflamma￾tory monocytes perform mainly M1 type functions. This hypoth￾esis is not fully supported by the studies previously cited, where in
different situations it was possible to observe both the differentia￾tion of Ly6C+ cells in M1 and of Ly6C− cells in M2 (45, 150) and
the transdifferentiation from Ly6C+ M1 cells to Ly6C− M2 cells
(156, 157).
A second hypothesis is that there are sequential waves of
monocyte recruitment into a tissue throughout the course of
an inflammatory reaction. Therefore, monocytes recruited into
the tissue at different times encounter different microenviron￾ments with different signals that can polarize them in M1 dur￾ing early phases and in M2 in late phases (156). In this case,
cytokines and other microenvironmental signals in the tissue play
a key role in determining the different functional phenotypes
of macrophages. Although the role of cytokines in steering the
macrophage functional phenotypes has been proven in vitro (179),
the situation could be very different in vivo, where M2 activity
is strongly increased in sterile wounds (157) or injured kidney
(190) in absence of Th2-like cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 (which in
any case do not induce the typical M2 phenotype, i.e., the deacti￾vated healing/repairing functional phenotype). In these cases, M2
macrophages derive largely from M1 macrophages, with mono￾cytes recruited from the circulation first acquiring an inflamma￾tory phenotype, and then persisting in the tissue and maturing
into repair macrophages.
Based on the latter data, a third hypothesis is that polarized
macrophage populations can switch one to the other in response
to different conditions. Data from in vitro studies demonstrate
that human monocytes can acquire the phenotype of polarized
M1 macrophages and then mature into M2 repair macrophages
upon exposure in culture to sequential changes in the microen￾vironmental conditions (191). Other studies demonstrated that
M2 macrophages are reprogramed to express M1 genes following
exposure to TLR ligands or IFN-γ (192, 193).
A related question is whether both tissue-resident macrophages
and monocyte-derived macrophages can polarize in M1 or/and
M2 functional phenotypes. We have described above that tissue
macrophages have basically an M2-like phenotype, whereas infil￾trating recruited monocytes differentiate in M1 or M2 depending
on the tissue conditions. For instance, it has been shown that
tissue-resident macrophages, rather than recruited monocytes, are
alternatively activated in the tissue during infection with Lito￾mosoides sigmodondis (102). Also, recruited monocytes can be
directly polarized into an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype by
basophil-derived IL-4, in order to alleviate allergic inflamma￾tion in the skin (194). Although it is not possible discriminat￾ing between tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages
in steady-state conditions, it seems that alternatively activated
tissue macrophages have a transcriptional profile and pheno￾type different from that of alternatively activated monocyte￾derived macrophages, with the latter having immunoregulatory
properties (195).
It should be considered that in vitro studies do not fully
recapitulate in vivo differentiation for two main reasons:
1. These studies are generally based on an heterogeneous popula￾tion of monocytes, encompassing all the blood subsets (Ly6C+
and Ly6C− in the mouse, and CD14+ and CD16+ in human
being), thus it cannot be defined whether upon different stimuli
the same cells can pass from a phenotype to another or whether
different subsets are activated in response to different stimuli.

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
2. While M2 macrophages can convert to the M1 phenotype, the
reverse generally does not occur, or it may only occur in par￾ticular conditions (e.g., in very mild inflammatory responses).
In fact, M1 is probably an end-stage killer cell that dies during
the inflammatory response, possibly succumbing to its own
NO production, as it was demonstrated in vitro (196). So, their
selective death may give the impression that they convert in
M2 cells, which in fact proportionally increase (145). It seems
that M1 vs. M2 polarization correlates with the capacity of
macrophages to produce NO (166) as opposed to the important
M2 driver TGF-β (164, 197, 198), thus the decrease in NO￾producing macrophages would increase TGF-β production and
amplify M2 polarization.
There are cases in which a phenotypic switch in the macrophage
population occurs over time, often associated with pathology (91,
141). Three specific examples of this phenotypic switch are the
following:
endotoxin tolerance, an altered state of responsiveness to sec￾ondary stimulation with LPS, resulting in a global and sustained
switch of the gene expression program from an inflammatory
M1 signature to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (199);
obesity-induced insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, and ather￾osclerosis lesions. These are metabolic syndromes that can lead
to a switch in the phenotype of adipose tissue macrophages
from wound healing (as in healthy non-obese human beings)
to classically activated macrophages (200, 201);
cancer, where the tumor-infiltrating classically activated
macrophages have the potential to contribute to the earliest stages
of neoplasia (202–204), and then, as the tumor progresses, can
progressively differentiate to a regulatory phenotype and eventu￾ally become cells that share the characteristics of both regulatory
and wound-healing macrophages (181).
Although the pathology provides the proof-of-principle that
macrophages can undergo dynamic transitions between differ￾ent functional states, it is possible that a mixture of M1/M2
phenotypes underlies these conditions (14, 145, 166). In the
past few years, gene expression profiling techniques and genetic
approaches have been used to cast some light on the plas￾ticity of macrophage activation. The commonly held view is
that macrophage polarization is driven by cues in the tissue
microenvironment, which can include cytokines, growth fac￾tors, and microorganism-associated molecular patterns. These
signals are thought to dictate a transcriptional response that
shapes the phenotype and function of macrophages based on the
physiological or pathological context. Progress has been made
in defining the molecular mechanism underlying macrophage
polarization, including signaling pathways, miRNA, epigenetic
modification, post-transcriptional regulators, and transcriptional
factors (189, 205–207). However, the data are still incomplete
and far from being systematic, and our knowledge of the
mechanistic basis of macrophage diversity in different tissues
or in response to changing environment is to a large extent
unknown.
POST-INFLAMMATION FATE OF
MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES
ANTIGEN PRESENTATION IN NON-LYMPHOID ORGANS
The capacity of taking up and presenting antigen (i.e., the link￾ing function between innate and adaptive immunity) is one of
the most important features of tissue macrophages (208). It has
been mentioned above that some monocytes that enter the tissue
during inflammation do not differentiate into macrophages, and
are able to take up antigen in the tissue and carry it to lymph
nodes where they can present it to naïve T-cells (64). In addi￾tion to this population of monocyte-like cells, tissue macrophages
are also able to present antigen, despite the fact that they do
not recirculate to lymph nodes after antigen uptake. That tissue
macrophages are highly phagocytic and can take up microorgan￾isms and other matter in the tissue is well known, as this is their
major function both in homeostasis and during inflammation.
That antigen presentation may occur also in non-lymphoid organs
has been suggested by several experimental evidence describing
antigen-specific local activation and expansion of primed T-cells,
but not of naïve T-cells (209–215). Based on this evidence, the
hypothesis proposed by Ley is that initial priming of naïve T￾cells occurs in the lymph node (to which antigen-loaded tissue
monocytes recirculate), but that the full activation and effector
functions of T-cells occur in the tissue where the inflammatory
reaction is taking place, upon the productive interaction and for￾mation of immunological synapse between primed T-cells and the
antigen-presenting tissue macrophages (the difference between
monocyte-derived tissue DC and tissue macrophages is bleared,
as they seem to be not much more than slightly different func￾tional differentiation states from a common precursor). Most
likely, the inflammatory monocyte-derived cells with an M1-like
functional phenotype are the antigen-presenting cells (APC) that
induce activation/polarization of effector Th1 and Th17 cells upon
production of IL-12 and IL-23, respectively, and in a TNFRSF
and TNFSF-dependent fashion (but independent of CD80, CD86,
and CD28 co-stimulation). Likewise, M2-like tissue macrophages,
which produce TGF-β and express the αVβ8 integrin are likely
involved in the polarization of iTreg cells, whereas their role in
Th2 polarization is less clear (208).
FATE OF ACTIVATED RESIDENT MACROPHAGES AND RECRUITED
MONOCYTES: PROLIFERATION, REPLACEMENT, AND M2-LIKE
POLARIZATION
Based on what described above, the cell populations present in the
tissue during the acute phase of an inflammatory reaction are the
following:
• Tissue-resident macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages.
These, after initial recognition of microbial or damage￾associated molecules, drive the influx of blood-derived mono￾cytes, which will become inflammatory macrophages. Their role
in initiating the inflammatory reaction possibly depends on the
nature and grade of challenge.
• Monocyte-derived macrophages, newly recruited and rapidly
occupying the inflammatory lesion, becoming the majority of
the macrophages present in the tissue. These cells induce the
Frontiers in Immunology | Inflammation October 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 514 | 14

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
inflammatory response by differentiating in the M1 functional
phenotype.
• Tissue monocytes, the recently described cells that can take up
antigens in the tissue and move to lymph nodes, where they are
able to present antigens to naïve T-cells.
• Memory macrophages, or trained monocytes, cells functionally
programed by a previously stimulus for either enhanced (train￾ing) or decreased (tolerance) cytokine production, depending
on the type and concentration of the stimulus they encoun￾tered [(216); see below]. Here, we consider them as a kind
of resident inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage, able
to react in a faster and stronger manner compared to other
macrophages.
A summary of the different macrophage types and of their fate
after the acute inflammatory phase is given in Figure 4.
In general, tissue-resident macrophages are maintained locally
by proliferative self-renewal (100, 106), and retain an M2-like phe￾notype, for example, in the peritoneal cavity, brain, and lung (86,
100, 161). The fate of monocyte-derived resident macrophages is
hard to follow, considering that it is not possible to fully discrim￾inate between them. However, we may hypothesize that they have
the same fate of tissue-resident macrophages, i.e., they maintain
an M2-like phenotype and a low self-renewal capacity. A number
of cells of both populations probably die during inflammation,
the extent of their survival possibly depending on the nature and
magnitude of the insult.
Generally, the inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages
are polarized toward M1, and the majority of them dies, killed
by their own NO production (see above). In an experimen￾tal acute lung injury model, these cells undergo Fas-mediated
death, while the resident alveolar cells persist (217). From that,
we can argue that M1 likely is a terminal differentiation pheno￾type. However, there are reports that they can also undergo in situ
phenotype conversation to become tissue-resident macrophages
either during inflammation or after experimental deletion of tissue
macrophages (48, 86). This underlines the notion that macrophage
polarization is both transient and plastic.
The survival in the tissue of inflammatory monocyte-derived
macrophages raises important questions that need to be answered.
Do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a “mem￾ory” of their past inflammatory activation, thereby becoming
memory macrophages? And, do tissue macrophages resume their
previous functional phenotype in response to a new inflammatory
challenge? Or, do they react as naïve cells?
Memory macrophages (also recently termed “trained mono￾cytes”) have been described, which retain a memory of past chal￾lenges (see below). Their fate in the tissue is, however, unknown,
since no long-term experiments have been performed in mam￾mals. It is possible that a part of them dies after reacting to a
new inflammatory challenge. If some of them survive (again, this
possibly depends on the type and magnitude of the new chal￾lenge), they would probably behave like inflammatory monocyte￾derived macrophages, i.e., they could become M2-like cells, having
a low level of self-renewal, and may also form a new popula￾tion of memory macrophages that retain the memory of multiple
challenges.
FIGURE 4 | Fate of the different monocyte/macrophage populations in
the tissue during the post-inflammatory phase. Tissue-resident
macrophages are in general maintained locally by proliferative self-renewal,
and retain an M2-like functional phenotype. The same situation is
hypothesized for monocyte-derived resident macrophages, since it is not
possible to fully discriminate between the two populations. A number of
cells of these two populations probably die during the inflammatory
reaction. Inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can die killed by
the NO they have produced, and the surviving cells can undergo in situ
phenotype conversion and become M2-like tissue-resident macrophages.
In addition, a number of these cells can conserve a “memory” of their past
inflammatory activation, and become trained monocytes/memory
macrophages. Monocytes recruited from the blood during the
post-inflammatory phase can lose the expression of Ly6C and become
Ly6C− cells, subsequently differentiating in M2 macrophages. They may
also become memory macrophages. Memory macrophages that are
present in the tissue, reminiscent of previous inflammatory events, would
probably behave like naïve macrophages upon a new inflammatory
challenge, except for a much quicker reaction, and will, therefore, mostly
die or generate M2-like macrophages or again memory macrophages. Their
life span in the tissue is presently unknown.

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
Another population that should be considered is that of mono￾cytes recruited from the blood during the post-inflammatory
phase. It is possible that these cells lose Ly6C expression when
in the tissue, thereby becoming Ly6C− cells that subsequently
differentiate in M2 macrophages.
MEMORY MACROPHAGES
It is long known that innate immune responses are higher to a
secondary infection/challenge, and that this higher reactive occurs
whether the new challenge is the same or different from the first
one (cross-protection). An old example is that of mouse peritoneal
macrophages from BCG-infected mice that have little/no activ￾ity 7 days after infection, and acquire significant citocydal activity
upon in vitro challenge with LPS or with a wealth of other stimuli,
while naïve macrophages do not (218). Recently, this phenom￾enon has been re-named trained innate immunity (219). Innate
memory plays an important defensive role in organisms lack￾ing adaptive immunity, such as plants and invertebrates, but it
is evident also in vertebrates lacking functional T and B lympho￾cytes (220). In these animals, this innate memory mechanism was
shown to involve innate immune cells with low turnover [such as
macrophages and NK cells; (221, 222)] that would be responsible
for improved pathogen recognition through pathogen recognition
receptors, and for an enhanced protective inflammatory response
(223, 224). NK cells could generate a memory response to viruses,
while macrophages retain memory of both bacterial and viral chal￾lenges. A logical possibility is that the microorganisms encoun￾tered by the host on a regular basis may serve to differentiating
and continually renewing a pool of memory-like macrophages
with enhanced reactivity to infectious challenges. The molecular
mechanisms responsible for shifting macrophages toward a mem￾ory status have not yet been elucidated. Putative mechanisms may
involve differences in the monocyte/macrophage population (i.e.,
CD14+ and CD16−) or changes in the expression of lectin recep￾tors on cell membrane (221), or in the functional phenotype (e.g.,
phagocytosis or protein production), but all are probably under￾lain by epigenetic reprograming that, through modification of
DNA, post-translational modifications of histones (methylation),
or microRNA, regulates gene expression by inducing dynamic
alterations in the chromatin structure (220). Establishment of
macrophage memory, depending on the experienced challenges,
is likely to rely on epigenetic changes, as these can be at the basis
of a rapid evolution of responsiveness and adaptation to incur￾ring events, thereby allowing to surviving to new environmental
threats (220, 225). Efficacy of many vaccines probably implies the
induction of non-specific macrophage memory that contributes
to the increased resistance to infections. Research in the field of
memory macrophages needs a thorough re-assessment of a large
body of old evidence accumulated in the past decades in the areas
of macrophage activation and of adjuvanticity.
CONCLUSION
An increasing amount of evidence supports four revolutionary
concepts/discoveries on monocytes/macrophages that will force
the researcher to rewrite the books of immunology:
1. The embryonic origin of tissue-resident macrophages, which
raises the need to better understand the features/properties
of monocytes (that are no longer simple precursors of tissue
macrophages), and those of macrophages, which are capable of
self-renewal without loss of their differentiated cellular identity.
2. The capacity of monocytes/macrophages to polarize into distinct
functional phenotypes able to initiate and direct virtually all
immune responses, including adaptive ones.
3. The notion of innate memory, an old concept that has been
recently revived with the description of the so-called trained
innate immunity.
4. The importance of macrophage-mediated antigen presentation
in tissue responses, with the identification of antigen-uptaking,
recirculating, and presenting “tissue monocytes,” and with the
notion that tissue macrophages are probably the major APC
upon a second challenge at the tissue level, without need of
recirculation to the lymph nodes.
The central role of monocytes/macrophages in this new view of
immunity implies that innate immunity has a major role in induc￾ing and modulating adaptive immunity (including the induction
of polarized T-cell responses), while on the other hand taking
advantage of adaptive immune mechanisms (e.g., T-cell-derived
cytokines) for modulating its own activity. Thus, new knowledge
on macrophage biology and functions will have a direct impact
on our understanding of immune responses and on the design
of novel therapeutic strategies. For this reason, it is necessary
to overcome several experimental obstacles that delay the full
understanding of the new dynamics and relationships within the
immune system, and that have been identified by the researchers
cited in the review.
For example, to date, transcriptome analysis of monocyte sub￾sets has been done at the basal unstimulated level, showing dra￾matic differences consistent with a different functional repertoire
for the three types of human monocytes. Circulating monocytes
are most likely “quiescent” (their quiescent status is needed in
order to avoid developing a deleterious intravascular inflamma￾tion), while their effector functions only develop after relocation
and activation in the tissue. Thus, the true role of the different
monocyte subsets could be only understood after activation, and
the stimulus-induced transcriptome of these cells will be required.
Further, the models of inflammation used to test the prolifera￾tive capacity of resident macrophages have so far been limited
to one or two rounds of tissue repopulation or relatively acute
periods of infection/inflammation. This obviously cannot provide
reliable information on the long-term capacity of macrophage
self-renewal. Moreover, when studying the plasticity and inter￾changeability of M1 and M2 macrophages, since mixed M1/M2
phenotypes can be found especially in pathological conditions, it is
capital to focus not only on populations but also either at the single
cell level or by lineage-tracking studies (e.g., with mice expressing
Cre ricombinase under the iNOS or arginase promoters, to track
M1 and M2 lineages, respectively). Precautions need to be taken
when drastic experimental procedures such as monocyte deple￾tion or parabiosis are used to study macrophages self-renewal.
These treatments can alter the concentration of circulating CSF￾1 and CSFR1 signaling, which are important for self-renewal of
resident macrophages under homeostatic conditions, and crit￾ical for differentiation of monocytes into tissue macrophages.

Italiani and Boraschi Monocyte to macrophage differentiation
Likewise, precautions and appropriate controls need to be imple￾mented when using CCR2-deficient mouse for studying monocyte
recruitment to the tissue, since the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine sys￾tem is also responsible of the release of monocytes from bone
marrow. Thus, the lack of recruitment of monocytes from the
blood to the tissue could be due to lack of release of monocytes
from bone marrow to the blood, where circulating monocytes are
decreased.
Our final recommendation, therefore, is probably obvious, but
it is anyway important to state it again. We need to re-evaluate
patiently and critically a huge body of experimental evidence that
is already present in the literature. In particular, we need to over￾come the lack of consensus in defining and describing the different
macrophage phenotypes (226). Many old studies have already gen￾erated information that, in light of our present knowledge, can
become very important and help us to clarify the general picture.
Second recommendation is that of designing experiments very
carefully, keeping in mind that the immune system is redundant
and that the same factor can have different activities, and that the
same activity can be carried out by different factors. Third recom￾mendation: monocytes and macrophages are never isolated in the
body, and what they do and what they become are totally influ￾enced by the surrounding cells and tissue.In vitro systems may only
partially reproduce this complexity. Last recommendation: con￾sider evolution as an incommensurable and most precious source
of information that can greatly help us understand the ontology
and behavior of monocytes and macrophages. Common mech￾anisms are many, and also species-specific differences exist, thus
we should be able to pick up the relevant common information
without, however, forgetting that human being is not a mouse or
a mosquito.
