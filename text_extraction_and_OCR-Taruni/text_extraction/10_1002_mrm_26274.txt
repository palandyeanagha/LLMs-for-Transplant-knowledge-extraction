Purpose: To develop a respiratory motion correction frame￾work to accelerate free-breathing three-dimensional (3D)
whole-heart coronary lumen and coronary vessel wall MRI.
Methods: We developed a 3D flow-independent approach for
vessel wall imaging based on the subtraction of data with and
without T2-preparation prepulses acquired interleaved with
image navigators. The proposed method corrects both datasets
to the same respiratory position using beat-to-beat translation
and bin-to-bin nonrigid corrections, producing coregistered,
motion-corrected coronary lumen and coronary vessel wall
images. The proposed method was studied in 10 healthy sub￾jects and was compared with beat-to-beat translational correc￾tion (TC) and no motion correction for the left and right coronary
arteries. Additionally, the coronary lumen images were compared
with a 6-mm diaphragmatic navigator gated and tracked scan.
Results: No significant differences (P > 0.01) were found
between the proposed method and the gated and tracked
scan for coronary lumen, despite an average improvement in
scan efficiency to 96% from 59%. Significant differences
(P < 0.01) were found in right coronary artery vessel wall thick￾ness, right coronary artery vessel wall sharpness, and vessel
wall visual score between the proposed method and TC.
Conclusion: The feasibility of a highly efficient motion correc￾tion framework for simultaneous whole-heart coronary lumen
and vessel wall has been demonstrated. Magn Reson Med

INTRODUCTION
Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has
shown potential as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to
assess the location and degree of lumen stenosis in coro￾nary heart disease (1). Because coronary atherosclerosis
is not necessarily stenotic (2) due to outward remodeling
of the vessel wall (3), both lumen and wall assessments
are desirable to more comprehensively detect coronary
atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaque burden increases
as disease develops, often without significant changes to
the vessel lumen. Because coronary plaque burden has
been correlated with risk of future coronary events (4),
direct and noninvasive visualization of the vessel wall is
desired. A three-dimensional (3D) flow-independent
approach for vessel wall imaging was proposed recently
(5) based on an interleaved acquisition and subtraction
of data with [T2prep(þ)] and without [T2prep()] a T2-
preparation prepulse. This approach simultaneously pro￾vides coronary lumen [T2prep(þ)] and vessel wall
images; however, the required subtraction is particularly
sensitive to respiratory motion corruption. Andia et al.
(5) minimized respiratory motion using a one￾dimensional (1D) “pencil-beam” diaphragmatic navigator
gating (6), with data being accepted only when both
T2prep(þ) and T2prep() acquisitions were within the
same small gating window of the respiratory cycle. This
led to long and unpredictable acquisition times, because
only a fraction of the acquired data was accepted for
reconstruction (referred to as scan efficiency). Another
limitation of 1D navigator gating is that only superior–
inferior (SI) global translation can be corrected. Thus,
motion from anterior–posterior (AP), right–left (RL), and
nonrigid components remain uncorrected, which has
been shown to be significant in some subjects (7,8).
Additionally, heart motion is estimated indirectly from
the right hemi-diaphragmatic displacement using a fixed
linear correction factor of 0.6 (9). It has been shown that
the optimal factor varies for different regions of the heart
and also for different subjects, meaning that motion arti￾facts may not be resolved fully if a fixed factor is used.

1894

Several approaches have been proposed to address
these limitations and compensate for motion in 3D coro￾nary MRA. Subject-specific scaling factors have been pro￾posed to improve motion correction (10,11) with no
change in acquisition time. Model-independent 1D self￾navigation techniques that repeatedly measure the k-space
center to infer the translational SI respiratory-induced
motion of the heart have also been proposed (12,13).
Because 1D self-navigation methods measure a projection
of the entire field of view, the estimated respiratory
motion may be corrupted by signal contributions from
static tissues such as the chest wall. Recently, image navi￾gators (iNAVs) have been introduced to directly estimate
the respiratory motion of the heart and allow separation of
static tissues from the moving heart (14–20). Most of these
approaches acquire a low-resolution image navigator
before the actual coronary MRA acquisition to correct
two-dimensional (2D) or 3D translational respiratory
motion in a beat-to-beat fashion (15,17). To account for
more complex motion, “respiratory binning” techniques
have been proposed (18,21). Beat-to-beat approaches usu￾ally provide high-temporal but low-spatial resolution
motion estimation, whereas binning approaches provide
high-spatial but low-temporal motion estimation. In the
binning approach, the acquired data are assigned to sev￾eral states of the breathing cycle (or “bins”) and are later
corrected to a reference position using the motion esti￾mated from the binned images. 3D affine motion can be
estimated from these bins and corrected in either k-space
(18) or directly in the reconstruction (21). Reconstruction￾based nonrigid correction has also been applied to cardiac
MR using motion derived from training data (22) or
coupled reconstruction problems (23). An alternative
approach to nonrigid correction has also been introduced
in the form of localized autofocusing techniques (24–26).
A recently introduced approach combined beat-to-beat
2D translational correction with bin-to-bin 2D affine cor￾rection for coronary lumen imaging (20). However, that
approach does not correct for motion in the AP direc￾tion, and only affine correction is performed in the other
two directions directly in the k-space. In this study, we
propose a combined motion correction approach for cor￾onary lumen and vessel wall imaging using beat-to-beat
(intra-bin) 2D translational motion correction (RL and SI)
and bin-to-bin (inter-bin) 3D nonrigid motion correction.
Motion-corrected vessel wall images are obtained by
acquiring a set of T2prep(þ)/T2prep() data interleaved
with a 2D iNAV in every heartbeat, which is used for
translation correction and binning. Bins are recon￾structed with soft-gated (27) iterative SENSE (28) and
nonrigid motion estimated via image registration (29) is
incorporated into a motion-compensated reconstruction
(30). Subsequently, vessel wall images are obtained by
subtraction as described by Andia et al. (5), producing a
set of motion-corrected, coregistered 3D coronary lumen
and vessel wall images. The proposed method (2D trans￾lation þ 3D nonrigid) was tested in 10 healthy subjects
and compared with a diaphragmatic gated and tracked
coronary MR angiogram, 2D translational motion correc￾tion, and no motion correction.
METHODS
Image Acquisition
Data were acquired using an interleaved scanning frame￾work (31). Three scans were performed simultaneously:
3D segmented whole-heart with T2 preparation
[T2prep(þ)], 3D segmented whole-heart without T2 prepa￾ration [T2prep()], and 2D single-shot golden radial coro￾nal iNAV. The protocol was defined to acquire the
T2prep(þ) and T2prep() datasets at alternating heart￾beats, with a 2D single-shot golden radial iNAV being
acquired every heartbeat (Fig. 1a). In every other heartbeat,
a T2 preparation pulse was applied [for T2prep(þ)], fol￾lowed by the 2D iNAV and a fat saturation pulse, prior to
3D segmented data acquisition. The interleave scheme for
the three scans is depicted in the sequence diagram of Fig￾ure 1a.
Motion Estimation and Correction
The framework for motion estimation and correction was
performed in two steps: 2D beat-to-beat translational
FIG. 1. Framework of the proposed approach. (a) Acquisition: Data are acquired using interleaved scanning, allowing for datasets with
and without T2 preparation [T2prep(þ) and T2prep(), respectively] to be acquired simultaneously with a 2D iNAV. In each heartbeat, a
T2 preparation prepulse (T2p) is applied [in T2prep(þ)], followed by the 2D iNAV, a spectral fat saturation pulse, and image acquisition
(AQ). The arrows depict the way in which the three sequences interleave at runtime. (b) Reconstruction takes place in two steps. First,
SI translation of the heart obtained from the 2D iNAVs is used to derive a 1D respiratory signal. Data are grouped into bins according to
the respiratory position, and intra-bin beat-to-beat translational motion is corrected in k-space for each bin. Each binned dataset is
reconstructed with soft gated iterative SENSE, and the resulting images are registered to retrieve a nonrigid motion field. Second, the
motion fields are used in a GMD reconstruction to correct inter-bin nonrigid motion.

motion correction followed by 3D bin-to-bin nonrigid
motion correction, as shown in Figure 1b.
Beat-to-Beat Translational Motion Estimation and
Correction
Beat-to-beat 2D translational motion was estimated from
the iNAVs. Golden-radial iNAVs undergo a gridding
reconstruction (32) using an iterative density compensa￾tion function (33), providing a set of low spatial, high
temporal–resolution images. A region of interest was
selected around the heart (20) and rigid image registra￾tion was performed (34) to estimate SI and RL global
translational motion. Outliers due to deep breaths were
removed prior to any corrections. K-space data with esti￾mated SI motion TSI > m þ 2s of the respiratory signal
(where m is the average respiratory position and s is the
corresponding standard deviation) were considered out￾liers and removed prior to reconstruction. Due to the dif￾ficulty of correcting and estimating motion in sparsely
populated regions of the respiratory cycle, we opted to
recover the approximately 5% most motion corrupted
data points (outliers) via parallel imaging (28). The iNAV
reference frame chosen for image registration corre￾sponded to the average position at end-expiration. SI
motion information was also used to bin the 3D image
data according to the position in the respiratory cycle.
2D global translational correction was applied within
each bin separately by the corresponding phase shift in
k-space (35):
K ¼ K0
e2pik0
T; [1]
where K is the translation corrected k-space, K0 the
acquired k-space, k0 the corresponding k-space trajectory
and T the estimated 2D translation vector.
Bin-to-Bin Nonrigid Motion Estimation
Bin-to-bin 3D nonrigid motion is estimated from the data
itself. After translational correction, each 3D bin is
reconstructed with a soft gating (27,36) approach in
which data are weighted according to their SI distance
from the center of the bin, TSI. The binned, soft-gated
reconstruction can be formulated as
I^b ¼ arg minIb fWbðEIb  KbÞ
2
2g; [2]
where Ib represents the reconstructed bin volumes; Wb is
a diagonal matrix containing data weights for bin b; E is
the encoding matrix that includes the Fourier transform,
coil sensitivities and sampling operations; and Kb repre￾sents the acquired data at each bin. The diagonal ele￾ments of Wb were defined to be a linear function of the
respiratory position of k-space data as follows:
wb
k ¼
1; if ðRSIðbÞ  Tb
SIðkÞ þ rÞ=r > 1

SIðkÞ þ rÞ=r < 0
ðRSIðbÞ  Tb
SIðkÞ þ rÞ=r; otherwise

>>:
[3]
where wb
k represents the diagonal weights for data k at
bin b, RSI (b) is the radius of bin b (i.e., the SI distance
from the bin center to the edge), Tb
SI (k) is the distance of
k-space point k to the center of bin b, and r is a parame￾ter defining the range of the soft gate. Points within the
bin have unity weight, decreasing linearly to zero as the
distance of bin radius plus soft gate range is reached.
Increasing r reduces undersampling artifacts at the
expense of minor blurring. Bins were reconstructed with
iterative SENSE (28). Image registration based on free￾form deformations (29) was performed, using the
end-expiration bin as reference (37), to estimate 3D non￾rigid respiratory motion.
Translation Plus Nonrigid Motion Correction
Translational correction is applied directly in k-space to
correct intra-bin motion, as described above (Equation
[1]). Inter-bin motion is corrected using the general
matrix description (GMD) introduced by Batchelor et al.
(30):
I^¼ arg minIfEI  K2
2g
E ¼ X
b
AbFScUb; [4]
where I^ is the motion-corrected volume, K represents
the translation corrected k-space data, Ab is the sampling
matrix for bin b, F is the Fourier transform, Sc represents
the coil sensitivities for coil c, and Ub represents the
nonrigid motion fields obtained via image registration.
The GMD reconstruction was performed with a linear
conjugate gradient method (38) using the relative resid￾ual as regularization to prevent noise amplification.
Coronary Vessel Wall
Coronary vessel wall was obtained via image subtraction
of the T2prep(þ) from the T2prep() datasets, as
described by Andia et al. (5), using
IVW ¼ T2prepðÞ  lT2prepðþÞ; [5]
where IVW is the vessel wall image and T2prep() and
T2prep(þ) are the motion-corrected images without and
with T2 preparation pulse, respectively. The parameter k
is used to achieve maximum cancelation of signal from
arterial blood. T2prep() and T2prep(þ) were registered
using nonrigid deformation (29) prior to image subtrac￾tion to guarantee spatial alignment. The optimum value
for k can be computed as a function of the heart rate and
acquisition protocol as shown by Andia et al. (5).
Experiments
Acquisition
Ten healthy subjects (age, 32 6 8 y) were scanned under
free-breathing on a 1.5T clinical scanner (Philips
Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) using a
32-channel coil. Written informed consent was obtained
from all subjects according to institutional guidelines,
and the study was approved by our institutional review
board. T2prep(þ), T2prep(), and iNAV data were
acquired using an interleaved scanning framework (31).
T2prep(þ) and T2prep() data were acquired with an
1896 Cruz et al.

ECG-triggered 3D balanced steady-state free precession
sequence using the following parameters: coronal slices;
RL phase encoding; in-plane resolution ¼ 1  1 mm; slice
thickness ¼ 2 mm; field of view ¼ 300  300  90 mm; rep￾etition time/echo time ¼ 5.3/2.6 ms; flip angle ¼ 70 ;
readout bandwidth (per pixel) ¼ 433 Hz; subject-specific
acquisition window (range, 105.5–116.1 ms correspond￾ing to 20–22 k-space lines acquired per heartbeat); spec￾tral fat saturation prepulse; subject-specific mid-diastolic
trigger; and a low-high (centric) Cartesian acquisition
with radial-like k-space order in the ky and kz direction.
The T2prep(þ) acquisition included a T2 preparation
pulse with a duration of 80 ms and two 180  adiabatic
refocusing pulses. A 2D golden radial iNAV was
acquired using a single-shot spoiled gradient echo
sequence using the following parameters: coronal slice
(same geometry as the image data acquisition); in-plane
resolution ¼ 4  4 mm; slice thickness ¼ 25 mm; field of
view ¼ 300  300; repetition time/echo time ¼ 2.4/1.07
ms; flip angle ¼ 5 ; acquisition window ¼ 47.2 ms with
24 angular profiles per cardiac cycle. Additionally, an
ECG-triggered 3D coronary MRA with diaphragmatic
respiratory gating and tracking (6 mm gating window and
tracking scaling factor of 0.6) was performed for compari￾son, using the T2prep(þ) protocol as described above.
The acquisition order of the proposed approach and the
gated and tracked coronary MRA scan was randomized.
The 3D coronary MRA protocol had a nominal scan time
of approximately 10 min at 60 beats/min.
Reconstruction
Three reconstructions for coronary lumen and the vessel
wall were obtained from the same acquired data: (1)
non–motion-corrected (NMC), (2) 2D translational correc￾tion (TC), and (3) the proposed two-step translational
and nonrigid correction (TCþGMD). In addition, the 3D
coronary MRA with a hemi-diaphragmatic navigator and
respiratory-gated and corrected reconstruction (Gated)
was used for comparison of coronary lumen images. The
proposed method used the following (empirically cho￾sen) parameters: three bins automatically defined such
that each bin had the same amount of data; the soft gate
range (r) was set to 1 mm to keep any residual motion
smaller than the voxel size; the minimum relative resid￾ual of the iterative reconstructions was set to 0.05%.
Four representative datasets (two male, two female) with
SI respiratory amplitude (average and standard devia￾tion) of 9.8 6 2.4 mm were binned and reconstructed
using three, four, and five bins. All reconstructions pre￾sented similar results upon visual inspection. Recon￾structions were compared with the proposed method
using three bins with metrics of lumen sharpness, vessel
wall sharpness, and vessel wall thickness (described
below). Data analysis was performed as described below;
sharpness metrics were normalized to TCþGMD using
three bins. One statistical difference (P < 0.01) was found
between three bins and four bins. The remaining 17
quantitative metrics (Table 1) did not differ significantly,
therefore three bins were used in this study to minimize
computational time. The stopping criterion (relative
residual) was determined by inspecting the noise ampli￾fication through different iterations of these bin
reconstructions.
Respiratory outliers were automatically removed before
TC and TCþGMD reconstructions as described above.
For the TCþGMD, each bin was translation-corrected
toward the central position of the bin. This translation￾Table 1

Highly Efficient Motion-Compensated 3D Coronary Vessel Wall 1897

corrected k-space (i.e., the k-space data of this group of
bins) was reconstructed with the GMD (30) after nonrigid
motion estimation. The TC approach used a 2D transla￾tional correction to a single reference followed by an
iterative SENSE reconstruction, taking approximately
120 s. The proposed TCþGMD required a set of 2D trans￾lational corrected soft-gated iterative SENSE bin recon￾structions (490 s), followed by nonrigid image
registration (170 s) and finally a motion compensated
reconstruction (1020 s) for a total of approximately
1680 s. All reconstructions, image subtraction, and post￾processing were performed offline in MATLAB (Math￾Works, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) on a PC with 12
CPUs (Intel Xeon 3.07 GHz). Coronary vessel wall images
were obtained as described in Andia et al. (5), where a
simulation study showed that the optimal l for a bal￾anced steady state free precession sequence lied between
1.21 and 1.27. Consequently, l ¼ 1.25 was used in this
study for all subtractions. All reconstructions were refor￾matted onto a 2D plane using “Soap-Bubble” software
(39), facilitating the visualization of the right coronary
artery (RCA) and left coronary artery (LCA). All image
metrics were evaluated on reformatted images after
4  zero-padding (0.25  0.25 mm in-plane reconstructed
resolution).
Data Analysis
To evaluate the quality of motion correction, measures of
vessel length, diameter, and sharpness were performed
using Soap-Bubble on the lumen of T2prep(þ) images
obtained with NMC, TC, TCþGMD, and gated recon￾structions. Lumen vessel length and diameter were
obtained by tracking the visible length of each coronary
vessel. Lumen vessel sharpness was computed by taking
the maximum gradient normalized to maximum center
line intensity of profiles along the visible portion of the
vessel. Lumen vessel sharpness was normalized to the
mean sharpness of the reference gated acquisition.
Lumen diameter and sharpness metrics were measured
separately for the proximal section (the first 4 cm of the
vessel), midsection, and full length.
To evaluate the impact of motion correction on the
vessel wall images, metrics of vessel wall thickness and
sharpness were computed on vessel wall images for
NMC, TC, and TCþGMD. The vessel wall was not always
visible in the distal sections of the coronaries; therefore,
quantitative metrics for the full length were computed
using predominantly the proximal and midsections. Ves￾sel wall sharpness was obtained by taking the maximum
gradient normalized to maximum intensity of profiles
along the visible portion of the vessel wall, but tracking
each side of the vessel wall of each coronary independ￾ently with Soap-Bubble. Vessel wall sharpness was
measured on a smaller vessel length than lumen sharp￾ness because the wall was not always visible in the dis￾tal sections of the vessel, particularly on TC and NMC
images. Vessel wall thickness was computed by first
manually defining 20 1D profiles across the visible ves￾sel wall of both RCA and LCA coronaries. Afterward, the
average full width at half maximum of the selected pro￾files was computed to measure the vessel wall thickness.
Vessel wall sharpness was normalized to the mean
sharpness of the TCþGMD reconstruction. Vessel wall
sharpness and thickness were measured separately for
the proximal, mid, and full length coronary sections.
Two experts (R.M.B. and M.H., with 20 and 7 years of
experience in coronary MRA, respectively) blinded to
the reconstruction methods were asked to score the
sharpness of the coronary vessels on the following scale:
0, extreme blurring; 1, significant blurring; 2, some
blurring; 3, minor blurring; and 4, no blurring. Visual
assessment was performed on both T2prep(þ) lumen and
vessel wall images.
Statistical significance of the automated metrics (vessel
sharpness, vessel diameter, vessel length, and vessel
thickness) was evaluated with a paired t test (P < 0.01);
statistical significance of the visual evaluations was per￾formed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test (P < 0.01). This
P value is stricter than that required by the Bonferroni
correction on a P value of 0.05 for the coronary lumen
and vessel wall comparisons (0.016 and 0.025, respec￾tively). Statistical significance was tested against the
Gated acquisition for lumen images and against
TCþGMD reconstruction for vessel wall images.
RESULTS
Scans were completed successfully in all subjects. Motion
correction with insufficient quality to visualize the coro￾naries was obtained for one subject using the TC and
TCþGMD approaches. This is thought to be due to the
large SI respiratory amplitude of 30.8 mm and consider￾able cardiac motion in this subject. The gated acquisition
had a scan efficiency of 29% in this case, and after two￾thirds of the scan all data were accepted due to low scan
efficiency. This subject was treated as an outlier, and its
results were not included in the statistics. The minimum,
maximum, and average (and standard deviation) of the SI
respiratory amplitude for the remaining subjects were
7.8, 17.8, and 11.0 6 3.2 mm, respectively. The minimum,
maximum, and average (and standard deviation) scan
efficiencies for the gated acquisitions were 40%, 70%,
and 59%6 11%, respectively.
Metrics for lumen sharpness, vessel wall sharpness,
and vessel wall thickness for the proposed TCþGMD
using three, four, and five bins are shown in Table 1.
Similar results were found with three, four, and five
bins, except for a significant difference between the
proximal vessel wall sharpness in the RCA between
three and four bins. No significant differences were
found for the remaining metrics; however, reconstruction
time increased significantly when using additional bins.
Three bins were used for all the remaining experiments
in this study. For the proposed TCþGMD, the bin sizes
(in millimeters) for the end-expiration, mid-cycle, and
end-inspiration bins were 2.49 6 0.91, 2.30 6 1.50, and
5.90 6 2.24, respectively. The corresponding undersam￾pling factors for these bins were 2.51 6 0.42, 2.21 6 0.35,
and 3.15 6 0.51, respectively.

Motion artifacts are visible in both coronaries in NMC,
which are reduced by both TC and TCþGMD, although

TCþGMD provides higher vessel sharpness in both the
LCA and RCA (magnified box in subjects 1 and 2). These
improvements are particularly visible in the distal part
of the vessels (arrows in subjects 1 and 2). A set of
T2prep(þ)/T2prep() with the corresponding vessel wall
image for subject 5 is shown in Figure 3. Most of the ves￾sel wall in NMC is obscured by motion artifacts (arrows).
Motion correction improves both T2prep(þ) and
T2prep() images, making the vessel wall visible in TC
and better delineated with TCþGMD (magnified). Vessel
wall images for TCþGMD, TC, and NMC for subjects 1–4
are shown in Figure 4. Corresponding cross-sectional
views for the locations in Figure 4 are shown in Figure
5. In Figure 4, the vessel wall for NMC appears blurred,
whereas delineation of the vessel wall is considerably
improved with TC and the sharpness of the wall further
improved by TCþGMD. These improvements are clearly
seen in the cross-section views in Figure 5. The wall is

NMC images is reduced with TC, and sharpness is further increased with TCþGMD (magnified boxes). The distal part of both coro￾naries is particularly affected by motion (arrows). Note that TC and TCþGMD have image quality similar to that for gated.

not visible in most cases for NMC, becomes visible for
most cases with TC, and appears better defined with
TCþGMD. Residual artifacts are visible in the vessel
wall images, originating from incomplete nulling of the
blood pool in the subtraction. Inhomogeneities in the B0
and B1 fields cause the T2prep to be spatially depend￾ent, leading to incomplete signal cancelation in some
regions of the image.
Metrics for T2prep(þ) coronary lumen evaluations are
shown in Figure 6. Measured lumen vessel lengths were
similar for gated and TCþGMD, with lower values for TC
and NMC. Significant differences were found between
gated and NMC for both coronaries. Lumen vessel length
indicates reduced visibility of the distal part of both
RCA and LCA when no motion compensation method is
employed (NMC), showing gradual improvements with

images. Most artifacts were removed with TC and further corrected with TCþGMD (arrows). Residual artifacts in either T2prep(þ) or
T2prep() contributed to blurring of the vessel wall and may have obscured it fully (magnified area in the Zoom row).

TC, TCþGMD, and gated. Similar results were found for
lumen vessel sharpness, with significant differences
between gated and NMC for both coronaries. TCþGMD
had the smallest lumen diameter for both coronaries,
whereas NMC had the largest due to blurring effects of
respiratory motion. No significant differences were found
in lumen diameter measurements. Lumen visual score
results were as follows: 3.00 6 0.95 for gated, 3.19 6 0.46
for TCþGMD, 2.79 6 0.76 for TC, and 1.29 6 0.72 for
NMC. NMC was significantly different from gated
according to lumen visual score. The gated acquisition
had an acquisition time of 1051 6 66 s; NMC, TC, and
TCþGMD had a fixed acquisition time of 620 s.
Metrics for coronary vessel wall analysis are shown in
Figure 7. Blurring due to motion resulted in increased ves￾sel wall thickness, as can be seen for NMC. Vessel wall
thickness in NMC was not always visible. Out of the nine
volunteers, NMC vessel wall thickness was not measured
in two using the full length and was not measured in four
using only the mid or proximal sections. The measured
vessel wall thickness (in millimeters) using the full length
for the LCA and RCA, respectively, were 1.20 6 0.20 and
1.08 6 0.16 for TCþGMD, 1.276 0.26 and 1.21 6 0.13 for
TC, and 1.80 6 0.39 and 1.42 6 0.14 for NMC. Significant
differences were found between TCþGMD and NMC for
both coronary arteries and between TCþGMD and TC for
the RCA using the full length and the midsection. Vessel
wall sharpness measures were in agreement with lumen
vessel sharpness metrics, however significant differences
were found between TCþGMD and NMC for both coro￾naries and between TCþGMD and TC for the RCA. Similar
results were found for the vessel wall visual score:
2.54 6 0.49 for TCþGMD, 2.15 6 0.64 for TC, and
1.00 6 0.60 for NMC. Significant differences were found
between TCþGMD and NMC and between TCþGMD and
TC. Detailed results for all metrics are shown in Table 2.
The corresponding P values for all metrics are provided in
Supporting Table S1.
DISCUSSION
A novel approach for nonrigid respiratory motion correc￾tion for 3D whole-heart coronary MRI has been proposed
and validated for simultaneous coronary lumen and ves￾sel wall imaging. The proposed method uses a combined
approach to motion correction: small amplitude motion

Highly Efficient Motion-Compensated 3D Coronary Vessel Wall 1905

is corrected with high temporal resolution intra-bin
translational corrections; large amplitude motion is cor￾rected with low temporal resolution inter-bin nonrigid
motion correction. Translational motion is estimated
from a golden radial 2D iNAV, whereas nonrigid motion
is estimated from the data itself via binning and image
registration. This approach was combined with an inter￾leaved T2prep(þ)/T2prep() acquisition, yielding motion
corrected, coregistered, 3D coronary lumen and vessel
wall images in a user-defined fixed scan time.
Bin-to-bin 3D nonrigid motion correction was per￾formed with the proposed TCþGMD approach after 2D
(RL and SI) beat-to-beat intra-bin translational correction.
TC approach corrects only for 2D (RL and SI) beat-to￾beat translational motion, thus AP motion remained
uncorrected in the TC method. Both approaches were
compared with a 6-mm gated and tracked reconstruction.
The TCþGMD approach in lumen imaging [T2prep(þ)]
showed improvements over TC and similar image quality
to that for gated, while ensuring a predictable and highly
efficient scan. No significant differences were found
between gated and TCþGMD for lumen imaging. Whereas
the proposed framework had a predictable scan time of
approximately 1240 s (20 min) for a T2prep(þ) and
T2prep() dataset (i.e., lumen and vessel wall imaging),
the corresponding gated approach (5) would be expected
to require at least 2 (1009 6 68) s (35 min at 60 beats/
min) plus additional time required for dual gating. For
this reason, only a gated T2prep(þ) data set was acquired
in this study. The performance of the proposed TCþGMD
on vessel wall imaging was compared with TC and NMC,
showing improvements over both approaches. Significant
differences were found between TCþGMD and TC for ves￾sel wall imaging in terms of vessel wall visual score, RCA
vessel wall thickness, and RCA vessel wall sharpness.
The proposed TCþGMD measured vessel wall thick￾ness (full visible length) of 1.20 6 0.20 mm and
1.08 6 0.16 for the LCA and RCA, respectively. Accord￾ing to previous studies (40,41), the coronary vessel wall
is expected to be approximately 1.0–1.1 mm thick. The
reason for the slight overestimation of wall thickness
may be two-fold: first, residual motion will manifest as
blurring, increasing the apparent width of the vessels
(and consequently the wall that is obtained by subtrac￾tion); second, the acquired spatial resolution
(1  1  2 mm) may be insufficient to fully visualise the
vessel wall and partial volume effects may occur, partic￾ularly in the distal part. Residual nonrigid motion may
be addressed by increasing the number of bins in the
framework. Here, the proposed TCþGMD was tested
using three, four, and five bins, yielding similar results
for different bins. Finer nonrigid motion correction is
expected with increasing number of bins; however,
undersampling artifacts also increase with the number of
bins and may compromise motion estimation accuracy.
For high number of bins, additional regularization in the
bin reconstruction may be required (e.g., compressed
sensing) to guarantee the reconstructions have sufficient
quality for reliable motion estimation. The vessel wall
was also partially obscured in some regions due to
incomplete nulling of the blood pool. Field inhomogene￾ities may cause the T2 preparation to vary in space (42),
therefore leading to an imperfect subtraction. This prob￾lem could be improved by optimizing the l parameter
for each subject. If estimates of the B0 (43) and B1 (44)
fields are available, then that information could be incor￾porated into a spatially varying l. Alternatively, this
issue could be alleviated by employing additional 180 
refocusing pulses during the T2 preparation or reducing
the duration of the T2 preparation. The last solution will
produce a more spatially uniform subtraction at the
expense of contrast in the vessel wall image.
In one subject with large respiratory amplitude
(31 mm, subject 10) and considerable cardiac motion,
the proposed motion correction approach was not suc￾cessful in removing all respiratory motion artifacts for
both coronary lumen and vessel wall images. To tackle
cases of large respiratory amplitudes, the proposed
method could be combined with some level of gating
while still maintaining high scan efficiencies.
A coronal iNAV was chosen over a sagittal iNAV for
this experiment, but in general any geometry and proto￾col can be used for interleaved scanning (31). Coronal
orientation has been shown to produce a superior lung–
liver interface leading to more accurate SI motion estima￾tion (45). Additionally, a coronal iNAV can use the
geometry of the T2prep(þ)/T2prep(), simplifying the
planning of the acquisition. The current framework uses
a 2D iNAV, meaning that beat-to-beat translational cor￾rection is unavailable in one dimension (this was AP for
the experiments performed). This limitation can be over￾come by extending the proposed approach to acquire a
low-resolution 3D iNAV before or after image acquisi￾tion. A preliminary study in (46) indicates that reliable
motion estimation may be obtained from a 3D iNAV
with a spatial resolution of 5  10  10 mm, acquired in
approximately 81 ms. Long-duration iNAVs could com￾promise the efficacy of preparation pulses; however,
compressed sensing may also be used to reduce the
acquisition time of the 3D iNAV. Arrhythmia rejection
was not implemented for the current version of the
framework; therefore, residual cardiac motion due to
respiratory sinus arrhythmia (47) may still be present.
(Arrhythmia rejection will be implemented in future
studies.) Compressed sensing could be used alternatively
to reconstruct undersampled data due to cardiac motion
in order to maintain the same scan time.
Future studies will explore more isotropic spatial reso￾lution to measure the vessel wall with increased accuracy.
The increased acquisition time will be addressed by com￾bining accelerated reconstruction with motion correction
to tolerate higher undersampling factors in both the bin￾ning and motion-compensated coronary lumen and vessel
wall reconstructions, as recently proposed for 3D abdomi￾nal imaging (48). Further study on optimal l values is
desired to produce more homogenous blood nulling in
the vessel wall image. Future studies will validate the
proposed method in patient scans and compare it with
alternative motion correction approaches.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, a framework for nonrigid respiratory
motion correction of simultaneous coronary lumen and
1906 Cruz et al.

vessel wall imaging has been introduced, using an inter￾leaved scanning and a combination of 2D translational
and 3D nonrigid motion correction. The proposed
method allowed for 96% scan efficiency on average,
reducing scan times by approximately 1.6  on average
relative to a gated acquisition while maintaining similar
image quality. No significant differences were observed
in coronary lumen images between the proposed
approach and the reference gated scans. Significant
improvements in the RCA vessel wall sharpness, RCA
vessel wall thickness, and vessel wall visual score were
observed when comparing the proposed approach with
translational motion correction alone.
