Introduction
Despite ample evidence that the kidney can both produce
and use appreciable amounts of glucose, the human kidney
is generally regarded as playing a minor role in glucose
homeostasis. This view is based on measurements of arterio￾renal vein glucose concentrations indicating little or no net
release of glucose. However, inferences from net balance
measurements do not take into consideration the simultane￾ous release and uptake of glucose by the kidney. Therefore,
to assess the contribution of release and uptake of glucose
by the human kidney to overall entry and removal of plasma
glucose, we used a combination of balance and isotope tech￾niques to measure renal glucose net balance, fractional ex￾traction, uptake and release as well as overall plasma glu￾cose appearance and disposal in 10 normal volunteers under
basal postabsorptive conditions and during a 3-h epineph￾rine infusion. In the basal postabsorptive state, there was
small but significant net output of glucose by the kidney
(66+22 jamol * min', P = 0.016). However, since renal glu￾cose fractional extraction averaged 2.9+0.3%, there was
considerable renal glucose uptake (2.3±0.2 amol kg -1
min') which accounted for 20.2±1.7% of systemic glucose
disposal (11.4+0.5 Amol kg-l minm ). Renal glucose
release (3.2±0.2 jsmol *kg-' min') accounted for
27.8+2.1% of systemic glucose appearance (11.4+0.5 ,umol￾kg-'. min'). Epinephrine infusion, which increased
plasma epinephrine to levels observed during hypoglycemia
(3722+453 pmol/liter) increased renal glucose release
nearly twofold (5.2+0.5 vs 2.8±0.1 mol kg- .min1, P
= 0.01) so that at the end of the infusion, renal glucose
release accounted for 40.3±5.5% of systemic glucose ap￾pearance and essentially all of the increase in systemic glu￾cose appearance. These observations suggest an important
role for the human kidney in glucose homeostasis. (J. Clin.

It has long been known from in vitro experiments and studies
in animals that the kidney can both produce and use appreciable
amounts of glucose (1-3). Nevertheless, the human kidney is
generally regarded as playing a minor role in glucose homeosta￾sis (4-6). This view is largely based on net balance experi￾ments finding no significant difference in arterial and renal vein
glucose concentrations (7-10) except in patients with respira￾tory acidosis (7) and in obese individuals after prolonged star￾vation (11).
However, the net balance approach does not take into con￾sideration simultaneous release and uptake of glucose by an
organ. These are distinct processes in liver and kidney subject
to separate regulation and occurring in different locations in
these tissues (1-3, 12, 13). By merely representing the differ￾ence between uptake and release of a substrate, net balance
measurements cannot evaluate the contribution of an organ to
the entry and removal of a substrate from the systemic circula￾tion. Moreover, inferences based on net balance measurements
may lead to an underestimation of the role of an organ in the
overall metabolism of a substrate.
For example, with isotope dilution determination of sys￾temic glucose flux, entry of glucose into the circulation is quan￾tified by the dilution of the plasma glucose tracer concentration
by unlabeled glucose released into the circulation (14). If the
kidney were to take up and release glucose at equal rates, there
would be no arterio-renal venous glucose difference, and net
glucose balance would be zero. Nevertheless, release of unla￾beled glucose into the circulation by the kidney would dilute
the plasma glucose tracer concentration and contribute to the
isotopic estimation of glucose entry into the circulation. Similar
considerations hold for the contribution of the kidney to removal
of glucose from the circulation as determined isotopically ( 14).
A combination of net balance and isotopic techniques is
necessary to assess individually the uptake and release of a
substrate by an organ (15, 16). Two recent studies (17, 18)
using this approach in dogs indicate that the kidney may be
responsible for > 20% of glucose entry into the circulation and
> 30% of glucose removal from the circulation under postab￾sorptive conditions and that renal glucose metabolism is sensi￾tive to hormonal regulation. Comparable studies have not been
conducted in humans (19).
We therefore undertook the present studies to assess the
contribution of the kidney to systemic glucose flux in normal
postabsorptive humans and to determine whether release of glu￾cose by the human kidney was under hormonal control. For this
purpose we used a combination of net balance and isotopic
methods and infused volunteers with epinephrine. Our results
indicate that in postabsorptive humans (a) renal glucose release

accounts for approximately 25% of all glucose entering the
circulation; (b) renal glucose uptake accounts for 20% of
glucose removed from the circulation; and (c) that physiologic
concentrations of epinephrine stimulate renal glucose release.
These observations thus provide evidence that the human kidney
may play an important role in glucose homeostasis.
Methods
Subjects. Informed written consent was obtained from 10 normal volun￾teers (9 men, 1 woman) after the protocol had been approved by
our local Institutional Review Board. The subjects were 26±2
(mean±SEM) years of age, weighed 80±3 kg (body mass index
24.9±0.8 kg/M2), had normal glucose tolerance tests according to
World Health Organization criteria (21) and no family history of diabe￾tes. For 3 d before the study, all had been on a weight maintaining diet
containing at least 200 grams carbohydrate and had abstained from
alcohol.
Protocol. Subjects were admitted to the University of Rochester
General Clinical Research Center between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. in the
evening before experiments; they consumed a standard meal (10 kcal/
kg, 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein) between 6:00 and
8:00 p.m. and were fasted overnight until experiments were completed.
At - 5:30 a.m., an antecubital vein was cannulated and a primed￾continuous infusion of [6-3H]glucose (30 ACi, 0.3 pCi/min; Amersham
International, Amersham, UK) was started. As a pilot study for a differ￾ent protocol, subjects were also infused with either [U-_'4C] glutamine
and [3- 3C] alanine, [U-'4C]glycerol and [3- '3C]lactate, or [ring-d5]
phenylalanine and [ring-d4] tyrosine. Between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. a
right (n = 8) or left (n = 2) renal vein was catheterized through the
right femoral vein under fluoroscopy and the position of the catheter
tip was ascertained by injecting a small amount of iodinated contrast
material. The catheter was then continuously infused with a heparinized
saline solution (5.6 U/min) to maintain patency.
At 9:00 a.m. a dorsal hand vein was cannulated and kept in a thermo￾regulated Plexiglass box at 650C for sampling arterialized venous blood
(22) and an antecubital venous infusion of p-aminohippuric acid (12
mg/min) was started for determination of renal blood flow. After
allowing 4 h to achieve isotopic steady state, three blood samples
were collected simultaneously from the dorsal hand vein and the renal
vein at 30-min intervals (-60, -30, 0 min) for determination of glucose
(in triplicate), insulin, glucagon, epinephrine and p-aminohippuric acid
concentrations and glucose specific activity. At 0 min, a continuous
infusion of either epinephrine (50 ng - kg -' - min -') (n = 6) or normal
saline (n = 4) was started via the antecubital infusion line and blood
was collected as described above at 30-min intervals for 3 h.
Analytical procedures. Blood samples for glucose concentrations
and specific activity (SA) were collected in oxalate-fluoride tubes, for
epinephrine in EGTA tubes and for insulin and glucagon in EDTA tubes
containing a protease inhibitor. Whole blood glucose was immediately
determined in triplicate with a glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs Instru￾ment Co., Yellow Springs, OH). For other determinations, samples were
placed immediately in a 4°C ice bath and plasma was separated within 30
min by centrifugation at 4°C. Plasma [3H] glucose SA was determined in
duplicate by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (22).
Since preliminary studies indicated that HPLC-determined SA's on
whole blood and plasma extracts were identical and since plasma was
easier to process, we used plasma for specific activity measurements.
The circulating concentrations of tritiated glucose were calculated as
the product of their SA and whole blood glucose concentration. Plasma
insulin and glucagon concentrations were determined by standard radio￾immunoassays as previously described (23). Plasma epinephrine con￾centrations were determined by a radioenzymatic method (24)
and plasma p-aminohippuric acid concentration by a colorimetric
method (25).
Calculations. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was determined by the p￾aminohippuric acid clearance technique (26) and renal blood flow

(RBF) was calculated as RPF/(1 - Hematocrit). Fractional extraction
(FX) of glucose across the kidney was calculated as ([6- 3H] glucose
SAf, x [glucose],,, - [6- 3H] glucose SArena vein X [glucose]renal vein)/
([6-3H]glucose SAN, X [glucose],) (15). Renal glucose uptake
(RGU) was calculated as RBF x [glucose],, x FX, and renal glucose
net balance (NB) as RBF x ([glucose], - [glucoselrenalvein) (15).
Renal glucose release (RGR) was calculated as RGU - NB (15).
Overall appearance and removal of glucose from the circulation was
determined using steady state equations under basal conditions (14) and
subsequently during infusion of epinephrine or saline using non-steady
state equations of DeBodo et al. (27). A volume of distribution of 200
ml/kg and a pool fraction of 0.65 were used. It was assumed that the
liver is the only organ other than the kidney capable of adding glucose
to the circulation, and therefore hepatic glucose release (HGR) was
calculated as the difference between the overall appearance of glucose
and renal glucose release. Use of monocompartmental equations can be
associated with as much as a 20% underestimation of the rate of appear￾ance of glucose under conditions in which there are large and rapid
changes in plasma glucose specific activity such as during hyperinsulin￾emic clamp experiments (28, 29). Underestimation of overall glucose
appearance during the epinephrine infusions due to deficiencies of
monocompartmental equations would result in underestimations of HGR
as calculated above. However, since isotopic steady state was approxi￾mated during the last 30 min of the epinephrine infusion when statistical
comparisons were made, deficiencies of these equations would have
minimal, if any, influence.
Statistical analysis. Unless stated otherwise, data are expressed as
mean±SEM. Paired two tailed Student's t tests were used to compare
arterial and renal vein glucose concentrations and specific activities.
Nonpaired two tailed Student's t tests were used to compare data ob￾tained during saline and epinephrine infusions. A P value less than 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.

this period, renal vein glucose concentrations were slightly but
significantly greater than arterial concentrations while arterial
[3H]glucose specific activities and [3H] glucose concentrations
were greater than renal vein values. These data indicate that
there was significant net output of glucose by the kidney coinci￾dent with simultaneous uptake and release of glucose by the
kidney.

accounted for essentially all of the increase in systemic glucose
appearance.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that in postabsorptive normal
volunteers the kidney simultaneously takes up and releases ap￾preciable amounts of glucose. Its release of glucose accounted
for 20-42% (average 28±2%) of all glucose released into the
circulation and its uptake of glucose accounted for 13-31%
(average 20±2%) of all glucose removed from the circulation.

Figure 2. Overall glucose appearance, renal glucose release, and hepatic
glucose release during infusion of saline or epinephrine
(30), caused a sustained increase in renal glucose release that
by 3 h accounted for essentially all of the increased appearance
of glucose in the circulation.
These observations challenge the current view (4-6) that
the human kidney plays a minor role in glucose homeostasis.
It must be appreciated however, that the current view is based
on net balance measurements (7-10) which represent the dif￾ference between uptake and release of glucose by the kidney.
Had we relied on mere net balance measurements, our baseline
results would also have indicated a minor role for the kidney
in postabsorptive glucose homeostasis. On the other hand, net
balance measurements during the epinephrine infusion would
have demonstrated an appreciable increase in net renal glucose
output.
Our finding that renal glucose release accounts for 20-42%
of systemic glucose release in the postabsorptive state is consis￾tent with recent studies in dogs using similar techniques ( 18,
19). These observations and the response of the kidney to epi￾nephrine suggest an important role of the kidney in glucose
counterregulation and provide a possible explanation why peo￾ple with chronic renal failure are prone to develop hypoglycemia
(31 ). It has been demonstrated that hepatectomized-nephrecto￾mized animals develop hypoglycemia more rapidly than hepa￾tectomized animals (32-34).
Our finding that the human kidney is responsible for 13-
31% of glucose removal from the circulation is also consistent
with recent findings in dogs using similar techniques ( 18, 19).
This uptake of glucose by the kidney in the postabsorptive state
is comparable to that reported for skeletal muscle (35) and
splanchnic tissues (36, 37). If uptake of glucose by the kidney
were regulated by insulin in humans as it is in dogs and rats
(13, 19, 38), our observations could explain to some extent the
insulin resistance found in patients with chronic renal failure
(39) since loss of a major target organ for insulin could result
in insulin resistance.
Renal Glucose Metabolism 2531

Regarding the mechanism for renal glucose release, the nor￾mal human kidney does not contain appreciable glycogen stores
(40). Moreover, renal cells which have appreciable glucose
phosphorylating capacity and thus the ability to accumulate
glycogen have relatively little glucose-6-phosphatase activity,
whereas cells having little phosphorylating capacity possess
abundant activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and other gluconeo￾genic enzymes ( 13, 41). It is thus likely that release of glucose
by the kidney is due mainly if not exclusively to gluconeogene￾sis. Consistent with this conclusion is the fact that the reported
net renal uptake of key gluconeogenic precursors (e.g. lactate,
glycerol, glutamine and other amino acids) is sufficient to ac￾count for all of the release of glucose by the kidney observed
in the present studies (8-10).
In terms of net balance, the net output of glucose by the
kidney ( < 1 ,umol * kg -.I min -1) observed in the present study
was small compared to that of the liver (a- 8 jimol -kg-'
min'). However, if gluconeogenesis were the predominant
mechanism for renal glucose release, our results provide evi￾dence that the kidney may be as important a gluconeogenic
organ as the liver. For example, the best estimation at the present
time indicates that about 30-40% of glucose appearance in
plasma in normal postabsorptive humans is due to gluconeogen￾esis (42, 43). Our results indicate that the kidney accounts for
25% of all glucose released into the circulation. If all of this
were due to gluconeogenesis and gluconeogenesis represented
40% of overall glucose appearance, the human kidney would
be responsible for > 60% of gluconeogenesis. Since increased
gluconeogenesis appears to be mainly responsible for the in￾creased rate of appearance of plasma glucose in non-insulin￾dependent diabetes mellitus (44, 45), it is of interest to note that
kidneys of experimental diabetic rats exhibit increased output of
glucose (46, 47) and increased activity of renal gluconeogenic
enzymes (48).
In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that
in postabsorptive normal volunteers the kidney accounts for
> 25% of all glucose appearing in the circulation and - 20%
of all glucose removed from the circulation and that renal re￾lease of glucose is stimulated by epinephrine at plasma epineph￾rine concentrations observed during hypoglycemia. These ob￾servations suggest an important role of the human kidney in
glucose homeostasis.
