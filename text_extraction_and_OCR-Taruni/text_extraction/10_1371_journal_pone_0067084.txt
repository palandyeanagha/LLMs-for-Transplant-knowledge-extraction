Abstract
Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is due to loss of NPC1 or NPC2 protein function that is required for unesterified cholesterol
transport from the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Though lung involvement is a recognized characteristic of
Niemann-Pick type C disease, the pathological features are not well understood. We investigated components of the
surfactant system in both NPC1 mutant mice and felines and in NPC2 mutant mice near the end of their expected life span.
Histological analysis of the NPC mutant mice demonstrated thickened septae and foamy macrophages/leukocytes. At the
level of electron microscopy, NPC1-mutant type II cells had uncharacteristically larger lamellar bodies (LB, mean area 2-fold
larger), while NPC2-mutant cells had predominantly smaller lamellar bodies (mean area 50% of normal) than wild type.
Bronchoalveolar lavage from NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice had an approx. 4-fold and 2.5-fold enrichment in phospholipid,
respectively, and an approx. 9-fold and 35-fold enrichment in cholesterol, consistent with alveolar lipidosis. Phospholipid
and cholesterol also were elevated in type II cell LBs and lung tissue while phospholipid degradation was reduced.
Enrichment of surfactant protein-A in the lung and surfactant of the mutant mice was found. Immunocytochemical results
showed that cholesterol accumulated in the LBs of the type II cells isolated from the affected mice. Alveolar macrophages
from the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice were enlarged compared to those from wild type mice and were enriched in
phospholipid and cholesterol. Pulmonary features of NPC1 mutant felines reflected the disease described in NPC1 mutant
mice. Thus, with the exception of lamellar body size, the lung phenotype seen in the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice were
similar. The lack of NPC1 and NPC2 proteins resulted in a disruption of the type II cell surfactant system contributing to
pulmonary abnormalities.

Introduction
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive
lysosomal storage disorder marked by excess intralysosomal
cholesterol, progressive neurodegeneration and hepatosplenomeg￾aly that has no effective approved treatments [1]. Loss of NPC1 or
NPC2 protein function results in Niemann-Pick type C1 or type
C2 disease, respectively. The two types of NPC disorders are
thought to be clinically and biochemically indistinguishable, with
reports of pulmonary involvement in both with alveolar proteinosis
and foamy macrophages, although NPC2 disease seems to have a
more severe phenotype [2,3,4]. Whereas the pulmonary disease
can be acute, the surfactant system in Niemann-Pick disease has
not been fully described in detail. There has been a case report of a
patient with a frameshift mutation in NPC2 and reduced NPC2
protein levels. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from this patient
was analyzed and a marked accumulation of surfactant phospho￾lipid and cholesterol was shown [2]. NPC2 hypomorph mice and
patients with NPC2 disease develop alveolar periodic acid-Schiff￾positive material, indicative of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
(PAP) [2]. PAP is a rare lung disorder characterized by abnormal
accumulation of surfactant with little to no inflammation and
fibrosis.
The most common mutations associated with NPC disease
(95% of cases) are in the NPC1 gene with the affected patients
demonstrating a broad clinical spectrum [5]. However, lung
abnormalities are not well characterized. Animal models of NPC1
disease include mice and felines. The pathology of the lung in
Npc1nih/nih mice demonstrated vacuoles in type I and endothelial
cells and foamy alveolar macrophages [6]. Cholesterol and
phospholipid accumulation in the lung organ of the Npc1 mice
has been documented but surfactant was not analyzed [6,7,8]. The
feline model of NPC1 disease is a domestic short-haired cat with a
spontaneous missense mutation (C955S) in NPC1. The feline
NPC1 mutation is orthologous to the most common mutation in
juvenile-onset patients [9]. The cats demonstrate progressive
neurologic symptoms with dysmetria, ataxia and whole body
tremor and the liver and spleens have significantly higher levels of
unesterified cholesterol. Cultured feline fibroblasts demonstrate
perinuclear accumulation of cholesterol utilizing the same assay
employed in the identification of NPC disease in humans [10].

Pulmonary abnormalities have not been examined. The patho￾logic changes in the mouse and human lung with NPC disease
implicate a dysfunction in type II cells, the primary surfactant
secreting cell.
Pulmonary surfactant, produced by type II alveolar cells,
performs the critical role of reducing surface tension in the alveoli.
Cholesterol is the most abundant neutral lipid in surfactant,
contributing 5–10% weight by volume, with the rest made up of
phospholipids and protein [11]. Cholesterol influences the stability
and surface viscosity of surfactant making it an important
component in the determination of surfactant physical properties
[12]. Elevated (.20%) cholesterol inhibits surfactant function,
contributing to surfactant dysfunction in ARDS and acute lung
injury [13,14]. One model suggests that cholesterol accumulates at
the surfactant-air interface, interfering with the formation of
stacked bilayer patches, structures that contain surfactant lowering
protein SP-C [15]. Turnover of surfactant phospholipid is well
studied while little is known about the molecular mechanisms
regulating surfactant cholesterol. Most lung cholesterol is derived
from plasma lipoproteins and radioactive tracer studies demon￾strated the delivery of labeled cholesterol from lipoproteins to
lamellar bodies and, subsequently, to surfactant secreted into the
alveolar space [16]. Type II pneumocytes synthesize and store
surfactant in lamellar bodies (LBs), lysosome-related organelles,
prior to secretion into the airspace. The Niemann-Pick C pathway
has been shown to regulate the removal of low density lipoprotein
(LDL)-derived cholesterol from the lumen of the late endosome/
lysosome system to the cytosolic compartment [17,18]. We
hypothesized that this pathway may play a role in surfactant
cholesterol transport since we showed that the Niemann-Pick C
(NPC) proteins, NPC1 and NPC2 were present in lamellar bodies
[19]. NPC1 is an endo-lysosomal transmembrane protein that
contains a sterol-sensing domain [17]. NPC2 is a 132 amino acid
soluble, mannose-6-phosphate targeted lysosomal protein that also
is found in the alveolar space [18,19]. A current model suggests
that NPC2 binds the unesterified cholesterol released after the
hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl ester by lysosomal acid lipase. The
NPC2 protein then docks to the second luminal domain of NPC1
and cholesterol is exchanged between NPC2 and the N-terminal
domain of NPC1 [20,21,22]. NPC1 protein directs the egress of
cholesterol from the lysosome through an unknown mechanism,
possibly involving the oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 5
[23]. Inhibition of the NPC pathway in isolated type II cells with
pharmacological inhibitor U18666A leads to accumulation of
cholesterol in the lumen of lamellar bodies, suggesting that the
NPC pathway plays a role in regulating lamellar body cholesterol
[19].
Reports on the morphology of type II cells in lungs of patients or
animal models of NPC deficiency describe the pneumocytes to be
‘‘unremarkable’’ [6]. However, due to the cholesterol accumula￾tion in the lung tissue of NPC1-deficient mice [24] the marked
pulmonary lipid accumulation in the NPC2 patient [2], and the
presence of NPC1 and NPC2 in the lamellar bodies of type II cells
[19], we hypothesized that mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2
would result in a dysfunction in pneumocytes and adversely alter
the surfactant system. This study was undertaken to define the
effects of disorders in cholesterol transport due to the absence of
NPC proteins on type II cell homeostasis. We have employed
detailed histological and biochemical analysis of alveolar type II
cells, macrophages, lamellar bodies, and surfactant in NPC1 and
NPC2 mutant mice and NPC1 mutant felines. The NPC1 and
NPC2 pulmonary diseases were compared to determine whether
any pathologic characteristics differed between them. As treat￾ments for the central nervous system dysfunctions in NPC disease
are making progress, a more complete understanding of the lung
pathogenesis will aid in the assessment of new therapies specific for
the pulmonary components of the disease.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The mice and felines were housed under the National Institutes
of Health and USDA guidelines for the care and use of animals in
research. The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all experimental
protocols.
Animals
Mice. Npc1nih/nih and Npc2 hypomorph mice on a BALB/c
background were obtained as a gift from Dr. Peter Lobel. Both
types of mice are established models of NPC disease. The Npc1
mouse defect arose due to a spontaneous mutation in mouse
chromosome 18 [8]. 24 base pairs of unidentified sequence
replaced 44 base pairs of the wild type sequence, resulting in a
frame shift and premature truncation of the open reading frame
[25]. The Npc2 mutant mice were produced by Sleat, et al. and
contain an aberrant recombination event such that the targeted
allele has an additional repeat of intron 1 and replacement of
amino acid cysteine 42 with a stop codon [26]. As a result,
immuno-detection found little to no NPC2 expression in most
tissues. The genotypes of the Npc1 and Npc2 mice were determined
by PCR of genomic DNA from tail tips. The primer pairs have
been previously described [26]. Mice were housed in a pathogen￾free animal facility at the University of Pennsylvania in HEPA￾filtered cages and were fed ad libitum. Both male and female mice
were used in the study and were sacrificed between the ages of 9–
13 weeks. Age-matched litter mates were used as wild type
controls.
Feline. The felines were housed in the School of Veterinary
Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania. NPC1 mutant
diseased felines and their normal counterparts were produced
from the same line. The NPC1 felines have a spontaneous
missense mutation (C955S) in the NPC1 protein which results in
lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol [9,10]. At one
day of age, peripheral blood leukocytes from blood drawn for the
cats were tested by PCR analysis of genomic DNA to determine

genotype [27]. Affected and control felines were used between 21
and 25 weeks of age.
Type II Cell and Lamellar Body Isolation
The isolation of type II cells from mice lungs was performed as
described previously [28]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized, the
chest cavity exposed and the trachea was intubated with a
mechanical ventilator to inflate the lungs. The heart was perfused
in a saline solution to remove blood cells from the lung. Lungs
were filled with saline, excised from the chest cavity, and washed
three times with saline to remove macrophages and bronchoal￾veolar lavage (BAL). An elastase solution was instilled down the
trachea, tissue was chopped in a McIlwainTM Tissue Chopper,
enzyme was quenched in FBS, and cells were panned on a mouse
IgG coated dish to remove macrophages. Later, non-adherent cells
were moved to a separate dish and incubated overnight at 37uC.
These cells were designated isolated type II cells.
Lamellar bodies were isolated as described previously [29].
Briefly, lungs of 2 to 6 mice or a piece of one lung of a cat were
perfused with saline to remove blood cells, rinsed in 0.25 M
sucrose, blotted on filter paper, homogenized, filtered through
gauze, and pooled. The homogenate was separated on a sucrose
gradient, with lamellar body bands appearing between 0.45 and
0.50 M sucrose. Lamellar body containing bands were removed
with a glass pipette, the refractive index was measured with a
refractometer and the molarity of the fraction was determined.
The harvested fraction was diluted to 0.2 M sucrose in water,
centrifuged at 20,0006g for 15 minutes. Pellets were stored at
280uC until use.
Western Blotting
Lung tissue from 9–14 week old mice was collected, homog￾enized, and separated using denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate￾polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described (8).
Primary antibody against rabbit anti-NPC1 (diluted 1:200 Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO), NPC2 (diluted 1:750, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, Cat# HPA000835), secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (diluted 1:3,000, Upstate Milli￾pore, Billerica, MA), and ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection
Reagent (GE Healthcare, Amersham, Piscataway Township, NJ)
were used.
Histology & Alveolar Septal Thickness
Lungs from wild type, NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice were
excised from 3 animals for each experimental group. From each
mouse, the left lobe, upper right lobe, and lower right lobe were
fixed overnight in a mixture of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde,
and embedded in paraffin. Tissue was cut into 5 mm sections and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Random fields of distal airway
were collected at 606magnification. Alveolar septal thickness was
determined using an overlaid test grid. The alveolar septal
thickness was measured as the length of a grid line that extended
from one alveolus to an adjacent alveolus. Regions containing

large airways or capillaries were not included in this measurement.
.200 probe ‘‘hits’’ of the alveolar septal thickness were gathered
from more than 5 sections per mouse and 15 fields for each
experimental condition.
Electron Microscopy
Lungs from mice were perfused through the pulmonary artery
with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer to remove blood cells. Lungs
were excised and fixed by perfusion with 5% glutaraldehyde
through the pulmonary artery and trachea. The trachea was
removed, and whole lungs were fixed for at least 4 hours. A
portion of the lung from a cat were perfused with cacodylate buffer
through the bronchi and fixed by immersion in 5% glutaralde￾hyde. Lungs were cut into 1 mm3 blocks, treated for 2 hours with
2% osmium, dehydrated, embedded in EPON, and polymerized
for 48 hours at 60uC. Blocks were sliced into ultrathin (80 nm)
sections in a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome. Samples were
stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 0.5% lead citrate. All samples
were imaged on a TEM (100-CX, Jeol).
Measuring Cholesterol and Phospholipid
To measure cholesterol, samples were prepared following
instructions in the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, Cat #A-12216). Protein for each corre￾sponding sample was determined using the Lowry assay and data
are presented as mg lipid/mg protein [30]. Phospholipid concen￾tration was determined by phosphorus assay [31]. Briefly, the lipid
fraction was separated from the water soluble fraction using the
Bligh-Dyer method and dried completely in a glass tube [32].
Dried samples were resuspended in 70% perchloric acid (HClO4),
heated for 20 minutes, and then cooled. Distilled water and
ammonium molybdate were added to the sample and vortexed
before the addition of reagent A (amino naphtha sulfonic acid,

sodium sulfite, Na meta-Bisulfite). Samples were boiled for 10
minutes, cooled and colorimetric reading was done at 830 nm.
Isolated Lung Perfusion
Uptake and degradation of liposomes labeled with [choline￾methyl-3
H] dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ([3
H]-DPPC) by the
isolated, perfused lung was performed as described previously [33].
Briefly, liposomes of DPPC, egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), egg
phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol (molar ratio of 10:5:2:3) with
trace amounts of [3
H]-DPPC were prepared by freezing and
thawing followed by extrusion under pressure through a 100-mm
pore-size filter. The liposomes (10 nmol of DPPC in 20 ml of
saline) were instilled into the lungs of anesthetized mice; the lungs
were removed and placed in a perfusion apparatus under
ventilation. After 5 min (time required for lung isolation, baseline)
or 2 hours, the lungs were lavaged and the lung tissue
homogenized. The homogenate was extracted [32] and the
aqueous and lipid fractions isolated. Phospholipids in the organic
phase were fractionated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel
plates with chloroform-methanol-ammonia-water (65:35:2.5:2.5,
vol/vol) as the solvent system and bands of interest scraped and
counted. Disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) was separated
from total PC on a neutral alumina column after osmication of
lipids [34]. Unsaturated PC, the product of lysoPC reacylation,
was calculated as total dpm in PC minus dpm in disaturated PC
(DSPC). Total degradation of internalized DPPC was calculated
from the sum of dpm in lysoPC, aqueous, and unsaturated PC
after subtraction of the baseline data (5 min).
Immunocytochemistry
Type II cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
minutes. Cells were washed, fixative was quenched in 0.3%
glycine, and cells were permeabilized in 0.2% triton for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 10% BSA with 2%
normal goat serum for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were incubated
on cells overnight in dilute blocking buffer. The next day, cells
were washed and incubated in secondary antibody for 1 hour.
Cells were then washed and imaged.

Statistics
All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Statistical comparisons
were performed using SigmaStat (Systat Software, Inc.). Data were
analyzed using a Student’s t-test or ANOVA. Results were
considered statistically significance at P#0.05.
Results
NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice have average life spans of 72
days [35] and 100 days [26], respectively. We examined the lung
tissue of NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice by Western blot in
homozygous mutant animals near the end of their lifespan
(approximately 63–70 days and 84–89 days, respectively). As
shown in Fig. 1, there was no NPC1 or NPC2 protein expression
detected in the lung tissue of the respective NPC1 and NPC2
mutant mice kept on a BALB/c background.
Lung Morphology
Histological evaluation of the lungs of NPC1 and NPC2 mutant
mice using hematoxylin/eosin stained sections was performed to
determine pulmonary effects due to loss of cholesterol transport.
The micrographs showed a thickening of the intra-alveolar septae
with a slight enlargement of the airways in the NPC1 mice (Fig. 2).
Quantitation of alveolar septum thickness revealed a significant
(P,0.05) increase in average thickness in NPC1 (9.160.3 mm,
n = 298) and NPC2 (10.860.5 mm, n = 401) mutants compared to
wild type mice (5.860.2 mm, n = 421). Both types of NPC mutant
mice lung contained ‘‘nests’’ of vacuolar filled macrophages and
enlarged foamy alveolar macrophages as previously reported for
NPC1 mice [6]. At this level, type II cells appeared unremarkable.
Upon closer inspection of the alveolar architecture at the
electron microscopic level, more pronounced pulmonary abnor￾malities were apparent. In Fig. 3, the wild type (WT) lung
demonstrated a normal appearing type II cell (A) and capillary (B)
and no macrophages (A) or visible surfactant (C). In contrast,
within the NPC1 and NPC2 mouse lungs (Fig. 3, NPC1, D and
NPC2, I) there was surfactant accumulation, a characteristic of
alveolar lipidosis (AL). The severe, more pronounced lipid
accumulation seen in NPC2 mice (Fig. 3, NPC2, I), although
present in both types, was not as typical as the examples shown in
Fig. 3, NPC1, D or NPC2, O. A detailed assessment of the
surfactant accumulation in these mouse models revealed several
physical forms which ranged from the striking accumulation of
surfactant as tight or loosely packed whirls of phospholipid-like
surfactant material in focal areas of the alveolar spaces as seen in
the NPC2 mutant mice (Fig. 3, NPC2, N) to the most common
form, string-like surfactant (Fig. 3, NPC1, D and G and NPC2, N
and O). In addition there was an accumulation of tubular myelin
and surfactant aggregates in large airways (Fig. 3, NPC2, K) and
large surfactant aggregates next to type II cells or in the alveolar
space (Fig. 3, NPC2, N). Proteinaceous-like material in the
alveolar space also was found in the lungs of both mice (example in
Fig. 3, NPC2, M).
Within mouse lung capillaries were enlarged polymorphonu￾clear leukocytes or circulating macrophages filled with vacuolar
inclusions were found in both mutant mice, apparent in NPC1
mice Fig. 3D, as reported previously [6], and NPC2 mice (Fig. 3,
NPC2, J). Capillary endothelial cells containing enlarged vacu￾oles/multivesicular bodies (designated by asterisks) were found in
both NPC1 (Fig. 3, NPC1, E,H) and NPC2 (Fig. 3, NPC2, L)
lungs, as previously described [6] in NPC1 mice. In both NPC
mutant mice, alveolar macrophages appeared greatly enlarged and
vacuole-filled, some with concentric multilamellar electron dense
surfactant-like materials (Fig. 3, NPC1, F, for example). Alveolar
macrophages were often found in close contact with type II cells
(Fig. 3, NPC1, E and NPC2, J). The type II cells were marked by
the presence of many autophagosomes found in both types of NPC
mutant mice (Example from an NPC2 mutant mouse in Fig. 3,
NPC2, P).
Size of Type II Cell Lamellar Bodies
It appeared that the lamellar bodies of type II cells from the
affected mice differed in size. Thus, a morphometric analysis of
lamellar body size of type II cells was performed for the NPC1 and
NPC2 mutant lungs and their matching litter mates using electron
microscopic images of the type II cells and ImageJ analysis. The

size of the LBs of wild type mice were primarily distributed in the
range from 0.2 mm2 to 0.7 mm2
. While some LBs in NPC1 mutant
mice showed a distribution similar to wild type, a significant
proportion of NPC1 type II cell LBs were enlarged (Fig. 4). 42% of
NPC1 mutant LBs had an area of 0.7 mm2 or larger, compared to
only 15% of wild type LBs. Surprisingly, most of the LBs of the
NPC2 mutant mice (70%) were similar in size as those of the
smaller sized wild type LBs (,0.2 mm2
) and were fairly uniform
with none larger than 0.7 mm2
. The mean average size of the LBs

(0.8160.02 mm2
).WT (0.4360.02 mm2
).NPC2
(0.2260.01 mm2
), all statistically significantly different (P,0.001,
n = 435–451 LBs) from each other. Interestingly, compared to the
number of LBs per cell in wild type alveolar type II cells (WT:
7.560.7 LBs/cell, 60 cells), NPC2 alveolar type II cells exhibited
65% more LBs (NPC2:12.461.1 LBs/cell, 37 cells, p,0.001)
while the LB numbers/cell between WT and NPC1 were
approximately the same (NPC1:8.260.6 LBs/cell, 53 cells).
Abnormal Lipid and Surfactant Protein-A (SP-A) Content
of NPC Mutant Mouse Lung
An enrichment in the cholesterol content of NPC1 mouse lungs
has been documented previously [24]. The surfactant system of
both the NPC1 and NPC2 mice was examined specifically by
measuring changes in the phospholipid and cholesterol levels of
the lung tissue, surfactant and lamellar bodies. Measurements of
the physical parameters of the mice used for the analysis presented
in Fig. 5 are shown in Table 1 and were typical for all the mice in
the study. The mutant mice had lower body weights than their
age-matched littermates. Since the lung weights were similar
between groups, the lung weight as a % of total body weight was
higher in the NPC mice (Table 1), as was shown previously for
NPC1 mice [8]. The lungs of the mice were lavaged and the
surfactant and lavaged lung tissues were processed for lipid and
protein content. Lipid analysis of the lungs of the wild type mice
demonstrated a minor enrichment of phospholipid and cholesterol
in the wild type littermates of the NPC2 mutant mice compared to
the littermates of the NPC1 mice, possibly due to the age
differences (89 vs. 63 days, respectively) (Fig. 5); however, the lungs
from both mutant mice showed a significantly elevated lipid
content over littermate controls. Both the phospholipid and
cholesterol content of the lavaged lung tissue from the NPC1 and
NPC2 mutant mice were enriched over their respective controls,
as has been shown previously for the cholesterol [8,24] and
phospholipid [8] content of NPC1 mutant mice where the entire
lung as an intact organ was examined.
As would be predicted from the lipidosis in the alveolar space
observed in the electron microscopic data, there was a marked
increase in surfactant phospholipid in both mutant mice. The
phospholipid levels of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were
elevated over control mice in the NPC1 mutant (4-fold) and in
NPC2 mutant mice (3-fold) (Fig. 5B), mirroring the abnormal
accumulation of surfactant within the alveoli at the EM level
(Fig. 3, NPC1, G, and NPC2, I). Even more striking was the
elevation in cholesterol levels, 12-fold in NPC1 (12-fold) and 35-
fold in NPC2 mutant BAL (Fig. 5B). When compared as a ratio,
the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio was increased in both NPC1
and NPC2 mutant BAL compared to wild type (Fig. 5B).
Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage showed that the NPC1
mutant mouse lung had a mild protein accumulation which was
not the case for the NPC2 mutant mice (Table 1). We further
characterized the lungs of the mutant mice, by analyzing the levels
of SP-A, the most abundant surfactant protein. Shown in Fig. 6 is
the quantitation (in arbitrary densitometry units) of the amount of

SP-A in the lung (normalized to actin) or in the surfactant (with
equal protein loading) and expressed relative to wild type samples
run on the same gel. SP-A levels were elevated three-fold in the
lungs and surfactant of the NPC1 mutant mice compared to age￾matched wild type. A similar enrichment in SP-A was seen in the
lungs of the NPC2 mutant mice. In the NPC2 surfactant, SP-A
levels were enhanced but the change did not reach statistical
significance.
Lipid analysis was performed on lamellar bodies isolated from
pooled samples of lung homogenates, either from NPC1 mutants,
NPC2 mutants or the wild type counterparts. The data revealed
an increase in phospholipid (2 to2.8-fold increase in both animals)
and cholesterol (6.8-fold increase and 7.9-fold increase, respec￾tively) content compared to wild type animals (Fig. 5C), with a
greater increase in cholesterol as shown by the cholesterol to
phospholipid ratio. Overall, changes in lung lipid content were

comparable between the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice, with
relatively minor differences.
To determine the effect of lipid enrichment of the lung and
lamellar bodies on surfactant uptake and degradation, we utilized
the isolated, perfused lung system. 3
H-choline-labelled DPPC
liposomes were instilled into the lungs of wild type or NPC1
mutant mice. After a two hour perfusion time, there was no
significant difference in the endocytosis of the DPPC by the lungs
(5.560.4% for wild type vs. 5.360.3% for NPC1, n = 3).
However, total degradation of 3
H-DPPC was reduced by 46%
in the NPC1 mice lungs as compared to wild type due to
significant decreases in all lipid and aqueous fractions (Fig. 5D).
Thus, the lipid accumulation and the absence of NPC1 protein
resulted in a decrease in DPPC degradation.
Cholesterol Accumulation in Lamellar Bodies of Type II
Cells of NPC1 Mutant Mice
To validate the biochemical finding of excess cholesterol in
lamellar bodies, we examined the cellular distribution of choles￾terol in isolated alveolar type II cells using filipin, a fluorescent,
free cholesterol-binding probe (Fig. 7A). In NPC1 mutant type II
cells, free cholesterol was apparent within the lumen of lamellar
body structures, marked by ATP-binding cassette sub-family A
member 3 (ABCA3). NPC2 mutant type II cells had evidence of
filipin staining of ABCA3 positive vesicles but the smaller size of
the lamellar bodies made intravesicular localization difficult
(Fig. 7A).
Alveolar Macrophages
Alveolar macrophages and type II cells together are responsible
for the majority of surfactant turnover, therefore we examined
alveolar macrophages from NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice [36].
Alveolar macrophages isolated from BAL of NPC1 and NPC2
mutant mice were laden with free cholesterol with many large,
foamy cells (Fig. 7B) compared to wild type macrophages. We
measured lipid levels in isolated alveolar macrophages and found
that phospholipid levels were elevated 6-fold in NPC1 mutant
mice, and 2-fold in NPC2 mutant mice. Cholesterol was also
elevated 15-fold in NPC1 mutant macrophages and 8-fold in
NPC2 mutant macrophages (Fig. 8).
Feline NPC1 Disease
The disease in affected NPC1 mutant cats is phenotypically,
morphologically, and biochemically similar to patients with a
mutation in the NPC1 gene and less acute onset [10]. Lung
histology revealed thickened septae, foamy leukocytes in the
capillaries and evidence of white blood cell infiltrate (Fig. 9) in the
affected feline. Analysis of the size of the feline lamellar bodies
using ImageJ quantitation of electron micrographs demonstrated a
range of sizes surprisingly similar to that seen with mice (Fig. 10).
The area of most of the wild type lamellar bodies ranged between
0.2 and 0.7 micron2
, while most of the NPC1 mutant feline
lamellar bodies were larger than 0.5 micron2
. Similar to the mice
lamellar bodies, the mean size of the NPC1 mutant mice lamellar
bodies were 0.9060.03 micron2 (n = 323 lamellar bodies, 3 cats)
versus 0.4060.02 micron2 (n = 250 lamellar bodies, 3 cats) for wild
type feline (P,0.05). Measurement of the lung lipid content
(Fig. 10A) demonstrated a 60% increase in phospholipid and a
striking 3.5-fold enrichment in cholesterol. Although the size of the
lungs precluded an accurate assessment of the total surfactant
lipid, the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio showed a 2.5-fold
enrichment in cholesterol over normal feline surfactant (choles￾terol/phospholipid ratio: wild type = 0.1160.03, n = 4; NPC1
mut = 0.2860.02, n = 3). The lamellar body phospholipid content
did not change while the cholesterol content was elevated by 7-fold
(Fig. 10B). Thus, the NPC1 mutant feline demonstrated lung
disease with pathological manifestations comparable to those seen
in mice.
Discussion
Our study, using histological, immunological and biochemical
procedures, demonstrates that the absence of NPC1 and NPC2
proteins in the lungs of mutant mice on a BALB/c background
results in lung disease. Pathologic characteristics at the light
microscopic level included thickened intra-alveolar septae, nests of
foamy alveolar macrophages and vacuolar-filled circulating
leukocytes. Electron microscopic analysis revealed excess surfac￾tant in the alveolar space and capillary endothelial cells with
enlarged vacuoles. The type II cells were shown to contain
autophagosomes and lamellar bodies of abnormal sizes. Many of

the lamellar bodies in NPC1 type II cells were enlarged and the
majority in NPC2 type II cells were small. Cholesterol accumu￾lation, a characteristic of the disease in other organ systems, also
was found in the various components of the lung surfactant system.
In both the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice, the lung tissue,
isolated lamellar bodies, surfactant, and alveolar macrophages
showed greater that 2-fold enrichment in cholesterol. In conjunc￾tion with this change, the phospholipid content of the tissue and

cells also increased with a rise in SP-A content in lung and
surfactant consistent with alveolar lipidosis and lipoproteinosis.
Initial reports found NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice to be
essentially identical using criteria such as accumulation of lipids in
brain and liver [26]. Likewise, similar pulmonary abnormalities
were seen in the lungs of NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice such as
accumulation of foamy, cholesterol-filled macrophages in the
alveolar space [2,6]. However, the lung phenotype is thought to be
more severe in the NPC2 mice compared to that reported for
NPC1 due to the lack of proteinosis in NPC1 mice, based on
histological analysis [37]. Our results, on the other hand,
demonstrated that alveolar lipidosis and other pathological
changes were at least as severe in the NPC1 mutant mouse
compared to the NPC2 hypomorph mouse. The main difference
between the two types of NPC disease was the changes in lamellar
body size. The more rapid progression of the disease in the NPC1
mouse versus the NPC2 mutant mice has been well documented
and serves as a model for the severe infantile onset form of the
human disease [26,38].
The feline NPC1 disorder, which progresses more slowly, is felt
to be an excellent model for the human pathogenesis [9].
Niemann-Pick disease type C felines harbor a single base
substitution (2864G-C) resulting in an amino acid change from
cysteine to serine (C955S) [9]. The cats demonstrate lysosomal
storage disease with hepatic and neurological manifestations
including lipid-laden macrophages in the spleen and bone marrow
and unesterified cholesterol accumulation in skin fibroblasts [10].
In addition, as shown here, feline NPC1 disease also demonstrated
a similar lung phenotype as the Npc1nih/nih mutant mice. There
was thickening of the alveolar walls, foamy capillary leukocytes,
and lipid-filled macrophages in the alveolar space. In addition, the
feline NPC1 type II cells contained enlarged (occasionally giant)
lamellar bodies and lipid-enriched lamellar bodies, surfactant and
lung tissue. Thus, both mice and feline animal models are suitable
for studies of disease progression and pulmonary complications
related to loss of a functioning NPC pathway.
We describe previously uncharacterized dysfunctions in type II
cells of the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice that may help to clarify
their contribution to the elevated surfactant cholesterol phenotype
associated with Niemann-Pick type C. First, the surfactant storage
organelles, the lamellar bodies, have significantly elevated
phospholipid and cholesterol content, which correlate to elevated
phospholipid and cholesterol in the surfactant. In support of this
data, immunocytochemistry directly demonstrated excess choles￾terol accumulated within lamellar bodies of type II cells isolated
from the NPC mutant mice. Second, there were anomalies in the
lamellar body size in the type II cells from both mutant mice:
enlarged lamellar bodies in NPC1 mutant mice, mirrored in the
NPC1 mutant felines; and small lamellar bodies in NPC2 mutant
mice. The relationship between lamellar body size an pulmonary

abnormalities is not yet clear although giant lamellar body
formation was associated with impaired surfactant secretion in a
mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) [39].
Thirdly, surfactant phospholipid degradation was inhibited,
presumably due to an effect on type II cells as they play a major
role in the degradation of surfactant PC [40]. What other
alterations in surfactant in surfactant metabolism occur remains to
be determined. Our studies highlight the importance of addressing
lung epithelial function as a potential underlying cause of lung
involvement in NPC disease.
Lamellar body size is an important indication of type II cell
health since lamellar body size is altered in a number of genetic
diseases such as ABCA3 deficiency and HPS [39,41,42]. We have
shown the presence of NPC1 and NPC2 in these lysosome-related
organelles where they may play a role in the regulation of lamellar
body surfactant cholesterol [19]. It is tempting to speculate that
the Niemann-Pick C proteins also may play a role in lamellar-body
genesis. Lamellar bodies originate as multivesicular bodies that
rearrange their internal phospholipid-containing membranes to
form larger lamellar bodies [43]. Although the cholesterol content
of the lamellar body from NPC mutant mice is high, it is unlikely
to be the reason for an enlarged organelle as cholesterol only
represents a small fraction of the total lipid. Since two lamellar
body populations (small and medium) exist in normal mice while
only one population (small) is found in the NPC2 mutant mice,
NPC2 may play a role in the formation or maintenance of the
medium sized lamellar bodies through its fusinogenic properties
[44]. NPC2, located within the lamellar body, may be required for
membrane rearrangement of multivesicular bodies, a necessary
precedent for formation of larger ‘‘mature’’ lamellar bodies while
NPC1 could interact with NPC2 and limit fusion. Thus, the
absence of NPC2 might result in a lack of fusion and smaller
lamellar bodies while the absence of NPC1 would result in
unchecked fusion and large lamellar bodies.
The absence of NPC1 protein in mice negatively affected
pulmonary function, where inspiratory capacity, elastance and
hysterisivity were increased in the diseased lungs [37]. The
mechanisms whereby elevation in lung and surfactant cholesterol
can result in disruption in the physiology and in the turnover of
surfactant are unknown but might include: First, alterations in
surfactant properties. Cholesterol is a critical yet understudied
component of surfactant that contributes to surface viscosity, such
that excess cholesterol interferes with surfactant function [2,12,45].
Second, membrane properties may be altered due to the inability
of cholesterol to exit the lysosomes and, thus, be unable to reach
the plasma membrane, detrimentally affecting plasma membrane
lipid rafts, surfactant secretion and endocytic vesicular uptake of
surfactant. Finally, free cholesterol accumulation has been
implicated in the intensification of oxidative stress and apoptosis,
both of which would lead to dysfunction of pneumocyte
metabolism [46].
In summary, we have identified defects in surfactant homeo￾stasis in both NPC1 and NPC2-mutant mice including elevated
surfactant phospholipid and cholesterol, elevated lamellar body
phospholipid and cholesterol, and abnormal lamellar body sizes.
Many of these pathologic changes were noted in the NPC1 mutant
feline pulmonary system as well. The work underscores the
importance of understanding the regulation of cholesterol
trafficking to maintain proper pulmonary function. These studies
elucidate novel characteristics of lung disease progression in
Niemann-Pick C1 and C2, and demonstrate that epithelial cell
dysfunctions can be a contributing source for lung disease.
