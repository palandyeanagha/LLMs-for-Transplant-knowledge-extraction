Abstract
We wanted to establish an in vitro human model for AIDS-as￾sociated dementia and pursue the hypothesis that this disease
process may be a result of soluble factors produced by HIV-in￾fected macrophages. Human brain aggregates were prepared
from nine different brain specimens, and were treated with su￾pernatants from in vitro HIV-infected macrophages (SI), unin￾fected macrophages (SU), infected T cells, or macrophage-con￾ditioned media from four AIDS patients.
Seven of nine treated brains exposed to SI showed periph￾eral rarefaction after 1 wk of incubation that by ultrastructural
analysis showed cytoplasmic vacuolation. Aggregates from two
of three brain cultures treated with SI for 3 wk became smaller,
an - 50% decrease in size. The degree of apparent toxicity in
brains exposed to patient-derived macrophage supernatants
paralleled the proportion of macrophages found to be express￾ing HIV p24. Ultrastructural abnormalities were not observed
in brains treated with supernatants from HIV-infected T cells,
uninfected macrophages, or LPS-activated macrophages. Lev￾els of five neurotransmitter amino acids were decreased in com￾parison to the structural amino acid leucine. These findings
suggest that HIV-infected macrophages, infected both in vitro
as well as derived from AIDS patients' peripheral blood, pro￾duce factors that cause reproducible histochemical, ultrastruc￾tural, and functional abnormalities in human brain aggregates.

Introduction
Neurological involvement, unrelated to tumors or opportunis￾tic infections, frequently accompanies AIDS and has been re￾ferred to as the AIDS dementia complex. Clinically, AIDS de￾mentia presents with cognitive impairment usually followed by
motor abnormalities (1). Progression of this dementia can be
mild or fulminant and has been shown to be variable among
AIDS patients. In most cases of AIDS dementia, computed
tomography (CT)' scanning and magnetic resonance imaging

(MRI) analysis reveal cerebral atrophy (1). Neuropathologic
findings in brains of patients with AIDS dementia complex
include focal rarefaction or spongiosis, vacuolation, and mi￾croglial nodule and multinucleated giant cell formation (2).
Evidence to suggest direct HIV infection of neural cells has
been reported. HIV DNA and RNA have been detected in
brains of AIDS patients and infectious HIV has been isolated
from brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (3-6). These data
coupled with the neurologic symptoms experienced by 60% of
patients with AIDS (7) strongly suggest that HIV is neuro￾tropic.
Productive HIV infection of primary cultured neural cells
(8, 9) has been difficult, and in the absence of cytotoxic infec￾tion of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the patho￾physiology of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in
AIDS may not be related to direct cellular infection. This evi￾dence supports the notion that an indirect mechanism may be
responsible for the neurological damage seen in AIDS demen￾tia. Three possible explanations have been suggested. First,
products ofvirus replication may cause damage to surrounding
cells. The envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) of HIV has been
shown to cause neuronal cell death in hippocampal cultures of
fetal mice (10) and stimulate monocyte function resulting in
damaging physiological metabolites (1 1). Secondly, HIV gene
products may interfere with factors necessary for neural cell
function. The HIV gpl 20 has been shown to inhibit the func￾tion of neuroleukin, a neurotropic factor that enhances neuro￾nal survival in culture (12). Finally, HIV-infected cells may
produce factors that alter neural cell function.
In AIDS patients, the cell type that appears to be an in vivo
reservoir of HIV infection is the monocyte/macrophage (13,
14). In the brain, the CNS macrophage or microglial cell may
also serve as a reservoir for HIV. Unlike the CD4' lymphocyte,
the macrophage appears to survive HIV infection. Recently,
HIV-infected macrophages were found to produce a potent
cytokine termed contra IL- 1 that blocked IL- 1-mediated T cell
activation ( 15). The current studies were conducted to test the
hypothesis that HIV-infected macrophages might produce solu￾ble factors capable ofaltering normal brain structure and func￾tion in vitro.
Methods
Brain aggregate cultures. These experiments used a normal human
brain aggregate culture system that contained all the cells ofthe central
nervous system with accompanying myelin (16). This system allows for
easy treatment and sampling ofbrain over time in culture. Human fetal
brain tissue between 15 and 18 wk gestation was obtained in accor￾dance with the University of California, San Francisco Committee on
Human Research and was gently dissociated through nylon screens to
obtain single cells. Suspensions with > 50% viability as determined by
trypan blue exclusion were counted on a hemocytometer, and 4 x 107
cells within 4 ml DME supplemented with 0.6% dextrose, 50 ,g/ml
gentamicin, and 10% FCS were distributed into 25-ml DeLong flasks
Human Immunodeficiency Macrophages Produce Factors that Alter Brain Cultures 503

(Beilco Biotechnology, Vineland, NJ). Aggregate cultures were con￾stantly rotated throughout the experiments and incubated at 370C in
an atmosphere of 10% CO2. After 2-3 d, the aggregate cultures were
transferred to 50-ml DeLong flasks and 5 ml of DME supplemented
with 15% FCS was added to each flask. 5-ml of medium was exchanged
every 2-3 d and replaced with fresh medium alone or with added treat￾ments. After - 10 d in culture and before each experiment, aggregates
were sampled for histology. Brain aggregates contain all the cells ofthe
central nervous system including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendro￾cytes, microglial cells, and rare ependymal cells and macrophages.
Neurons were recognized immunocytochemically by antibodies to
a-tubulin or neuron-specific enolase, astrocytes by antibodies to glial
fibrillary acidic protein, oligodendrocytes by antibodies to j galactocer￾ebroside, and antibodies to myelin basic protein (16). Electron micro￾scopic ultrastructure analysis was used to confirm findings at the light
microscopy level and to identify other cells present. Astrocytes and
neurons each make up > 40% of the cells present in aggregates. Neu￾rons are irregular in size; their nuclei are often bilobed and usually
contain a prominent nucleolus. The cytoplasm contains endoplasmic
reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and small lipo￾somes. Astrocytes contain cytoplasmic fibrils with glycogen granules,
mitochondria, and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. Oligodendro￾cytes represent - 10% of cells present in aggregates and are identified
by spherical or oval nuclei with dark irregular nucleoplasm. The
surrounding perikaryon contain rough endoplasmic reticulum, mito￾chondria, and often electron dense bodies. Microglia are identified as
cells smaller than astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with irregular nuclei
containing dense nucleoplasm and surrounded by scant cytoplasm.
Cells the size of astrocytes that have an oval nucleus with abundant
dense chromatin and a cytoplasm containing phagocytized cell debris,
myelin figures, and lipid droplets are considered macrophages. Rarely
is a cell observed that is characterized by a large nucleus, scant cyto￾plasm, and cilia, which are consistent with an ependymal cell.
Cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase (CNP) levels were determined
to quantify possible demyelination in the brain aggregate system. The
enzyme occurs in high levels in myelin and oligodendrocytes; thus, it
has been used as a biochemical marker for myelination/demyelination
processes (17). Brain aggregates can remain in culture and maintain
their cell surface markers without added growth factors for up to 2
mo (16).
Supernatant preparation and treatment. Supernatants were pools
prepared from seven different normal macrophage donors. Macro￾phages were isolated from peripheral blood of normal blood donors as
previously described ( 1 3) and one-half of the macrophages in suspen￾sion culture were infected at a multiplicity ofinfection (MOI) of 1 with
HIVDv strain. Both infected (SI) and uninfected (SU) macrophage cul￾ture supernatants were changed weekly with cells seeded at a concen￾tration of 2 X IO' cells/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
human serum. Infected and uninfected macrophages were maintained
in Teflon culture vessels (Savillex Corp., Minnetonka, MN) in suspen￾sion culture. 2 wk after infection, up to 30% of the cells from each
donor expressed HIV p24 as analyzed by flow cytometry using a
p24-specific murine MAb (13). All supernatants were ultracentrifuged
in an SW 28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 24 h (4°C) through a 25% sucrose
cushion to insure complete removal of whole virus particles. Superna￾tants from HIV-infected macrophages were tested in a standard HIV
titration system and found to be free of all infectious HIV. Pooled SI
were found to contain 30,000 pg HIV p24/ml, as measured by the
Abbott HIV antigen capture assay. Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)
and y interferon were not detected above background levels (assays
performed courtesy of Dr. Arthur Ammann, Genentech Corp., So. San
Francisco, CA).
For T cell infections, a T lymphoblastoid cell line (VB, also known
as SUPT- I) was used. This is a CD4+ T lymphoma cell line (human T
lymphotropic virus I-negative) that replicates HIV- I to very high levels
within 3-4 d of infection (14). Cells were inoculated with the isolate
HIVDv at an MOI of 0.005. Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37°C
and then washed to remove unbound virus. Cells were resuspended at
1.0 X I0 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Virus￾mediated cytopathic effects as well as HIV p24 levels peaked at 4 d after
infection, at which time the supernatants were harvested. Pooled super￾natants from HIV-infected VB cells were found to contain 350,000
pg/ml of HIV p24/ml as measured by the Abbott HIV antigen capture
assay after removal of infectious particles by ultracentrifugation.
Brain aggregates were incubated in media alone (described above),
20% uninfected macrophage supernatant (SU), 20% HIV-infected mac￾rophage supernatant (SI), or 20% HIV-infected T cell supernatant.
Treatments were begun 12-13 d after initiation of cultures and aggre￾gates were sampled weekly; media with or without 20% supernatant
were exchanged three times weekly. Seven human brains (HB) were
studied.
Patient HIV-infected macrophage supernatant preparation and
treatment. 30 ml ofblood were obtained (unlinked) from four patients
with AIDS in accordance with the University of California, San Fran￾cisco Committee on Human Research. The PBMC were separated
through a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, washed, and then were allowed to
adhere to glass overnight as described for the uninfected macrophages
above. After washing free any nonadherent cells, the adherent macro￾phages were scraped free, counted, and placed into teflon suspension
culture at 5 X I0O cells/ml in the above described macrophage medium.
After 5 d ofcultivation, the cells were spun out oftheir culture superna￾tant, which was frozen at -70'C until removal of virus particles by
ultracentrifugation and subsequent use in brain aggregate culture sys￾tems. The harvested patient macrophages were then split into two ali￾quots after fixation, permeablization, and were stained with anti-HIV
p24 MAb or irrelevant control antibodies as described above (13).
Immunocytofluorometric analysis was then performed and the percent
of cells that stained above background was enumerated for each speci￾men. A background fluorescence gate was arbitrarily set at 5%; 5% of
the isotype-matched control-stained macrophages fell within this gate.
The percent p24' cells was that percent above the 5% negative control
with values of 1.5% and less considered no different than background.
Supernatants from each of the patient specimens were used as de￾scribed above; treatment began 12-13 d after initiation of brain aggre￾gate culture and the specimens were harvested after I wk. Brain aggre￾gates were incubated in media alone, 20% macrophage supernatant
(SU), or 20% supernatant from patients A, B, C, and D. Supernatants
from normal macrophages treated with LPS (2 ug/ml, 48 h, 106 cells/
ml) were tested in parallel. Two human brains were studied.
Trypan blue and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) determinations.
Each day after treatment, 10-20 brain aggregates were put in trypan
blue for 1 min and viewed as a wet mount using light microscopy.
Exclusion oftrypan blue indicated viable cells. Parallel with this exami￾nation, 200 1AI of supernatant fluid was removed, centrifuged at 2,000
rpm for 10 min at 40C, and 100 ,d of supernatant was removed for
LDH assay using spectrophotometric methodology (18). LDH was
used as a biochemical index of neural cell injury.
Electron microscopy. Approximately 100 treated and untreated ag￾gregates were sampled after 1 wk and fixed in Karnovsky solution over￾night. After fixation, aggregates were placed in cacodylate buffer until
further processing. Aggregates were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide
dehydrated in 2'2-dimethoxypropane and embedded in polybred 8/2.
Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and cells
within 10 aggregates per experimental condition were examined in a
JEOL 100 SX electron microscope.
Histology and immunocytochemistry. Approximately 100 brain ag￾gregates were removed weekly and fixed for 18-24 h in 2% paraformal￾dehyde, washed with PBS, stained with eosin, and embedded in 1% low
temperature melting agarose followed by paraffin. Serial sections (6 um
thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), or were used
in an indirect avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique from Vector
Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Astrocytes were identified by antibod￾ies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) purchased from Dako Corp.
(Santa Barbara, CA) diluted 1:80 and neurons by antibodies to a-tubu￾lin diluted 1:80 and purchased from Immunobiologicals (Lisle, IL).
Diaminobenzidine from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) was used
504 L. Pulliam, B. G. Herndier, N. M. Tang, and M. S. McGrath

as the chromogen substrate and sections were counterstained with he￾matoxylin.
Brain aggregate diameters were determined on 20 aggregates from
three different brain specimens held for 3 wk in SU or SI. Brain aggre￾gate diameters in microns were determined on H & E stained slides
using a Leitz TAS Image Analyzer at the Laboratory for Cell Analysis
(University of California, San Francisco, CA). Statistics were done us￾ing the standard Student t-test.
Protein, CNP, and neurotransmitter amino acid (NAA) Assays.
Flasks containing several thousand aggregates were harvested after 1
wk of culture. Aggregates were solubilized in water, sonicated, and the
lysate was aliquoted for protein, CNP, and NAA analyses. Protein was
assayed spectrophotometrically in duplicate according to a Micro BCA
procedure (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL).
CNP (19) activity was assayed in duplicate on whole cell lysates
after protein determination. Approximately 300 .g protein was added
to the substrate 2',3'-cAMP (Sigma Chemical Co.) and allowed to react
for 30 min. Alkaline phosphatase was added to hydrolyze the reaction
product 2'-AMP. The liberated inorganic phosphate was combined
with ammonium molybdate to generate a molybdic acid complex
which was measured spectrophotometrically. I U of enzyme activity
was expressed as nanomoles substrate converted to product per minute
ofincubation at 30'C per milligram protein. Statistics were done using
analysis of variance.
NAA levels were analyzed in duplicate at the Protein Structure
Core Facility (University of California, Davis, CA) and determined on
whole cell lysates by using HPLC. A ninhydrin-based analyzer (model
6300; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) was used and concentra￾tions were expressed as nanomole/milligram protein. Data for CNP
and NAA were initially analyzed by a standard analysis of variance.
Paired comparisons between means utilized Newman-Keuls meth￾odology.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis using sheep anti-HIV
gp 120 polyclonal antiserum (courtesy of Dr. John Mills, San Francisco
General Hospital, San Francisco, CA) and control sheep serum was
performed on equal volumes ofsupernatant from both HIV-infected T
cells as well as HIV-infected macrophages after SDS-PAGE and elec￾troblot transfer to nitrocellulose. An Immunetics (Cambridge, MA)
Microblotter 28 was used in a standard Western blot protocol using
immune and control sheep serum at a concentration of 1:100 to detect
HIV gpl 20. Biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Zymed Laboratories,
South San Francisco, CA) was used as a second stage antibody and
avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase with 4-chloronapathol
used as a chromogen for the final step to visualize the Western blot
bands.
Results
In vitro infected macrophages produce factors toxic to human
brain cells. All brains exposed to supernatants from HIV-in￾fected macrophages showed similar morphologic changes. No
changes from control aggregates were noted in any cultures
containing uninfected macrophage supernatant (SU) or super￾natant from HIV-infected T cells (Fig. 1 a). Five of seven
treated (SI) brain cultures contained aggregates with profound
disruption of cellular morphology manifested as peripheral
rarefaction or spongiosis after I wk in SI (Fig. I b). From 20 to
90% ofthe aggregates from these brains were affected. In two of
three brain aggregate preparations that were cultivated for 3
wk, the spherical diameters in microns ofaggregates cultured in
SI were significantly smaller than those cultured in SU (P
< 0.001). (SU- I mean 458±135, SI- 1 194±52; SU-2 mean
411±132, SI-2 204±66, mean±SD with 20 aggregates mea￾sured/culture.)
To test whether the toxic effects observed in Fig. I would be
specific for a subtype of cell, all brain aggregates were analyzed

for neuronal and astrocytic markers as compared with con￾trols. Fig. 2 shows side-by-side comparison ofSI exposed aggre￾gates (Fig. 2 c, d) as compared with control aggregates (Fig. 2 a,
b). Using this method of analysis, no specific cellular subtype
appeared most sensitive to SI-mediated toxicity although two
of seven brain aggregates showed a decrease in neurons (Fig. 2
b, d). By electron microscopic ultrastructural examination, the
peripheral cells within aggregates were unrecognizable as to
cellular type and contained multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles.
Cells recognizable as neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes
also contained cytoplasmic vacuoles. Fig. 3 demonstrates the
ultrastructural differences between normal (Fig. 3 a) as com￾pared with SI exposed brain aggregates (Fig. 3 b).

HIV gpl2O has been reported to cause toxic changes in
rodent neural cells (10). To test whether the toxic effects ob￾served in SI-exposed brain aggregates would be mediated by
HIV gp120, equal volumes ofthe macrophage supernatant and
HIV-infected T cell supernatants were tested by Western blot
analysis for the presence of HIV gp 120. Fig. 4 shows the results
of this Western blot analysis. Note that in the macrophage su￾pernatant Western blot lanes (M), there are no significant
bands present in the lane containing the anti-gp 120 antiserum
(lane 2) as compared with the normal sheep control serum
(lane 1). The anti-gp 120 lane (lane 4) in the T cell supernatant
Western blots (T), however, had a prominent band at 120,000
mol wt, not present in the control antiserum (lane 3) lane.
These results show that the level of gpl20 present in macro￾phage supernatants is apparently substantially lower than in
the T cell supernatants. These findings make the findings seen
in Figs. 1-3 unlikely to be secondary to effects of HIV gpl2O.
Monocyte/macrophages from AIDS patients produce fac￾tors toxic to human brain cells. To test whether in vivo derived
macrophages would produce factors toxic to human brain cell
aggregates, culture supernatants were prepared from PBMC￾derived monocyte/macrophages from four patients with AIDS
(unlinked; no clinical information available). Monocyte/mac￾rophages isolated by glass adherence were placed into suspen￾sion culture at 5 x 10' cells/ml and cultured for 5 d at 370C.
These cells were centrifuged and the supernatants were pro￾cessed as described in Methods. The 5-d cultured monocyte/
macrophages were then stained with monoclonal anti-HIV p24
and control MAbs and the proportion of p24+ monocyte/ma￾crophages was quantitated by flow cytometry. The proportion
of p24+ monocytes at day 5 varied between < 1.5 to 8.8% (Ta￾ble II).
To test whether toxic factors existed in patient-derived
monocyte/macrophage supernatants, patient macrophages as
compared with control uninfected macrophage supernatants
were added to brain aggregates similar to experiments reported
with in vitro infected macrophage produced SI. As in the ear￾lier studies, several parameters were measured 1 wk after initia￾tion of culture, and results are summarized in Table II.
Brain aggregate cultures treated with uninfected macro￾phage supernatants or HIV-infected T cell supernatants had
recognizable neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Brain
aggregates treated with supernatants from patients A and B
histologically and by ultrastructural examination had a similar
appearance to aggregates treated with SI.
Supernatant from patient B (8.8% p24+ cells) caused the
most profound abnormalities in cultured brain aggregates.
Trypan blue staining of patient B treated aggregates showed
virtually 100% cell death confirmed by transmission electron
microscopy (Fig. 5 a) (100 cells from each). Cell cytoplasms
were lacking organelles and the nuclei appeared as shells de￾void of chromatin. Morphologic changes consistent with cell
death were accompanied by elevated levels ofLDH in superna￾tants from patient B's culture (Table II). Brain aggregates ex￾posed to supernatants from patient A monocyte/macrophages
(7.1% p24+ cells) also showed decreased cellular viability (30-
40% dead cells assessed by trypan blue staining) and superna￾tants showed a correspondingly increased level of LDH al￾though less elevated than in patient B. CNP levels also changed
in relation to observed toxicity with both CNP and LDH levels
from patient B aggregates increased more than threefold over
control cultures. By ultrastructural examination, all cells from
aggregates treated with patient A supernatant contained vacu￾oles throughout the cytoplasm. Nuclei were still intact but cell
identification was difficult (Fig. 5 b).
Brain aggregates exposed to supernatants from patients C
and D monocyte/macrophages showed lower levels of LDH
and histologically appeared similar to control aggregates. How￾ever, when analyzed by electron microscopy all neurons and
astrocytes treated with patient D supernatant (Fig. 5 c) con￾tained more than 10 cytoplasmic vacuoles. Neurons within
these aggregates also showed a dramatic increase in mitochon￾dria not seen in aggregates exposed to the other patient super￾natants or culture supernatants (Fig. 5 c). Cells within aggre￾gates exposed to supernatants from patient C had healthy look￾ing nuclei and normal organelles could be seen in the
cytoplasm, making it possible for cell identification. Aggregates
treated with patient C supernatant had the fewest ultrastruc￾tural changes: approximately one-half ofthe cells (mainly neu￾MW M T

LDH levels were increased relative to control supernatants;
however, ultrastructurally the brain aggregates exposed to acti￾vated macrophage supernatants were unchanged from control
aggregates with no cytoplasmic vacuolation detected in either
specimen. The overall meaning of increased levels of CNP in￾duced by the patient specimens as well as LPS activated super￾natant is unclear as electron microscopic examination of those
brains failed to show increased levels of myelin. Similarly the
meaning of elevated LDH levels in patient B exposed aggre￾gates almost certainly related to cell death as confirmed by
electron microscopy (Fig. 5 a).
Ultrastructural changes occurring in brain aggregates ap￾peared to most closely correlate with the proportion of macro￾phages expressing HIV p24. Note that the brain aggregates ex￾posed to supernatant from patient C show very little ultrastruc￾tural damage; however, there is progressive change from
patients D to A to B with increased evidence of toxicity occur￾ring as the proportion of p24' cells increased. These data sug￾gest that factors produced by HIV-infected macrophages de￾rived from AIDS patients were capable of causing severe ultra￾structural changes, changes that did not occur when parallel
brain aggregates were exposed to LPS-activated macrophages
known to produce high levels of IL-1 and TNF-a. Factors re￾sponsible for these ultrastructural changes have not yet been
characterized.
Discussion
In this paper we describe an in vitro culture system that may be
a model for AIDS-associated dementia. Supernatants derived
from HIV-infected macrophages caused ultrastructural and
functional changes in human brain aggregates cultured in vi￾tro. The observed changes were specific for brain aggregates
exposed to supernatants from infected macrophages, as HIV￾infected T cell supernatants, uninfected and LPS-stimulated
macrophage supernatants did not cause any measurable
changes in the brain aggregates. The effects were caused by
supernatants derived from macrophages infected in vitro as
well as macrophages isolated from patients with AIDS.
The principle and most reproducible findings in brain ag￾gregates exposed to HIV-infected macrophage supernatants
were toxic changes in all neural cell types. Immunocytochemi￾cal analysis of control as compared with SI-exposed brain ag￾gregates found that no specific subtype was preferentially de￾pleted in SI-exposed cultures except in two of nine brain aggre￾gates where there was a prominent loss of neurons. The
histochemical hallmarks of SI-exposed brain aggregates were
rarefaction and spongiform changes, changes that occurred in
20-90% ofaggregates in SI-exposed cultures. Ultrastructurally,
these features appeared as vacuolar changes in cytoplasms of
the SI-exposed cells. The most profound change was cellular
death as manifested by organelle dropout, loss ofcellular integ￾rity with parallel increases in supernatant LDH.
Supernatants from high virus-expressing (8.8% p24) AIDS
patient-derived macrophages caused the most cellular destruc￾tion in brain aggregates. The widespread histochemical and
ultrastructural damage was confirmed by dramatic trypan blue
incorporation and high LDH release. Brain aggregates exposed
to supernatants from the other three patients (A, C, D) showed
a decreasing severity of toxic changes correlating with the de￾gree of macrophage HIV expression. Patient A supernatants
showed both cytoplasmic vacuolation in all cells as well as
clumping of nuclear chromatin by electron microscopic analy￾sis, coupled with intermediately elevated levels of supernatant
LDH. Only subtle changes in cellular vacuolation (- 50% of
neurons) were present in the brain aggregates exposed to pa￾tient C supernatant (< 1.5% HIV+ monocytes).
One of the differences between brain aggregates exposed to
supernatants from in vitro infected macrophages as compared
with the patient-derived specimens, were results of CNP mea￾surements. Collectively, the seven brains exposed to in vitro
infected macrophage supernatants showed moderate but not
statistically significant increases relative to controls in brain
aggregate CNP activity. Brain aggregates exposed to patient
specimens all showed increased levels of CNP, without ultra￾structural evidence for increases in oligodendrocyte numbers
or myelin. The major variables that might account for these
disparate results likely revolve around the macrophage super￾natant sources. Patient-derived macrophages are infected with
native or "wild-type" HIV, which may function within macro￾phages in a very different manner than the in vitro propagated
HIV-lDV strain of virus. Another variable may be related to
degree of macrophage activation and/or differentiation be￾tween the two supernatant sources. The patient specimens
were cultured for only 5 d after glass activation whereas the in
vitro infected macrophages had been in suspension culture for
almost 4 wk, including 2 wk after in vitro infection. The patient
specimens would represent HIV-infected macrophages sub￾stantially more activated than the in vitro infected cells; how￾ever, macrophage activation alone (with LPS) was not suffi￾cient to cause the toxic effects observed in the exposed brain
aggregates. Further studies of these two macrophage sources

that the increased CNP activity occurred secondary to growth
factor elaboration in response to a toxic insult.
Virus gene products such as gp 120 have been implicated in
some in vitro experiments to account for HIV-related neurotox￾icity (10). However, our T cell supernatant shown by Western
blot analysis to be secreting gp 120 at a higher level than the
infected macrophage cultures did not cause significant struc￾tural and functional changes in the brain aggregates. Similarly,
the toxic effects are likely not elaborated merely by macro￾phage activation, as LPS-activated macrophage supernatants
caused no ultrastructural changes in exposed brain aggregates.
There were only slight increases in CNP activity and LDH
levels in the LPS-activated macrophage supernatant exposed
brain aggregates. Therefore, it is unlikely that a factor such as
TNF-a was responsible for mediating the toxic effects observed
in this study, and in a parallel analysis, no TNF-a was found in
supernatants from in vitro HIV-infected macrophages.
Fluctuations in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter
amino acids were assessed to determine their potential tole in
soluble factor induced brain dysfunction. Recent reports have
shown that excitatory amino acids (EAA) can cause secondary
brain tissue injury (23). All five neurotransmitter amino acid
levels showed a slight, not statistically significant decrease rela￾tive to the structural amino acid leucine when exposed to HIV￾infected macrophage supernatants. It was believed, based on
some preliminary data (not shown), that measurements ofsub￾tle changes in neurotransmitter amino acids would not be in￾terpretable in the setting of widespread cellular damage seen in
brain aggregates exposed to patient derived infected macro￾phages.
All of the brain aggregates exposed to supernatant from
AIDS patient macrophages manifested significant changes
both morphologically and enzymatically. It is unlikely that all
four patients had AIDS-associated dementia. Therefore, fur￾ther analysis in a controlled fashion of monocytes from pa￾tients with AIDS dementia as well as those without dementia
will be required in order to test whether levels of toxicity ob￾served in aggregates are related to both proportion of mono￾cytes expressing HIV as well as the patient's neurological
status.
The in vitro model described in this paper reproduces many
of the abnormalities found in brains of patients with AIDS
dementia including atrophic changes (a decrease in brain ag￾gregate size), rarefaction, and vacuolation changes within a
wide spectrum ofcell types. Furthermore, the lack ofa decrease
in CNP activity in the model is consistent with the inability to
correlate demyelination with AIDS dementia. We believe that
the culture system described in this paper approximates a valid
model for in vitro study of AIDS-associated dementia.
