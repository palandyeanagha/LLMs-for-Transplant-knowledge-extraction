Introduction
Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare cholestatic liver disease of infancy.
Initial management of BA consists of the Kasai portoenterost￾omy (KPE) and subsequently, in case of liver failure, a liver
transplantation (LTx). During KPE, the obliterated extrahepatic
bile ducts are resected and a portoenterostomy is constructed
in an attempt to re-establish bileflow. Adequate drainage of bile
is achieved in 38 to 75% of patients.1–4 Even if this procedure is
successful, liver fibrosis often progresses, resulting in cirrhosis.
Before the age of 20 years, 70 to 80% of the children will need
LTx.5 BA is the main indication for LTx at pediatric age.6,7
The progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis is accompanied by
the development of portal hypertension. The subsequent

Abstract Introduction Portal hypertension often occurs in biliary atresia (BA). The subsequent
development of esophageal varices and bleeding from these varices are a well-known
complication. We aim to describe the incidence and severity of variceal bleeding in
patients with BA. In addition, we describe the characteristics of patients who
experienced variceal bleeds.
Materials and Methods We included all infants treated for BA at our center between
March 1987 and August 2015. Variceal bleeding was defined as hematemesis and/or
melena with presence of varices at endoscopy. Findings at endoscopy and ultrasound,
laboratory tests, clearance of jaundice, fibrosis-grade at Kasai portoenterostomy, and
several varices prediction scores were documented. Routine endoscopies were not
performed.
Results In this study, 74 patients were included. During follow-up, 18 out of 74
patients (24%) developed variceal bleeding at an age of 9 months (range, 4–111).
Twelve patients were listed for liver transplantation at the time of bleeding. Patients
who did not clear their jaundice developed variceal bleeds more often and earlier in life.
Bleeds were treated with sclerotherapy, banding, or octreotide. Four patients did not
receive treatment. No bleeding-related mortality occurred.
Conclusion One-fourth of the children diagnosed with BA experience variceal bleeds
during follow-up. Most of these children are younger than 1 year and often already
listed for transplantation. Major complications did not occur after variceal bleeding.

development of esophageal varices (EVs) and bleeding from
these EVs are a well-known complication. In adult patients
with cirrhosis, screening for varices is recommended as pri￾mary prophylaxis.8 Previous studies have described several
aspects of screening for EVs and the development of bleeding
from these varices, and even though the authors suggest
endoscopic injection sclerotherapy as primary and secondary
prophylaxes,9,10 evidence for this practice is far from conclu￾sive.11 Noninvasive methods, such as assessment of platelet
counts and spleen size on ultrasound, might be helpful to
identify children at high risk of EV bleeding.12–14 Also, the
varices prediction rule (VPR) showed to be a useful tool in
identifying patients eligible for endoscopic screening for
EVs.15,16 In the Netherlands, all endoscopies in children are
performed under general anesthesia, which in itself is not
without risk.
In the present series, we investigated the incidence and
severity of EV bleeding during follow-up of children after KPE
for BA. In addition, we compared patient characteristics as
well as endoscopic, laboratory, and ultrasound findings of
children who experienced EV bleeds and those who did not.
Materials and Methods
This retrospective study was performedin accordance with the
guidelines of the Medical Ethical Committee of University
Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands (No. 201600448).
We collected data on 74 children (30 boys and 44 girls) who had
been treated for BA at our institution between March 1987 and
August 2015. In the present series, we focused on the patients
who presented with EV bleeding. Our institution is the only
pediatric LTx center in the country. The diagnosis of BA was
established during intraoperative cholangiogram and/or his￾topathology of the liver and the biliary remnant. In accordance
with the METAVIR criteria,17,18 we scored liver fibrosis as: (1)
no fibrosis, (2) mild fibrosis, or (3) moderate (bridging) fibrosis
or cirrhosis. Clearance of jaundice was defined as a total serum
bilirubin < 20 µmol/L within 6 months after KPE.
We graded EVs as follows: Grade 1, varices defined as small
straight varices, Grade 2, defined as enlarged tortuous varices
occupying less than one-third of the lumen, and Grade 3,
defined as large coil-shaped varices occupying more than
one-third of the lumen. Bleeding from EVs was defined as a
combination of (1) hematemesis and/or melena and (2) pre￾sence of varices during endoscopy. We noted the need for red
blood cell (RBC) transfusion separately. Amajor complication as
a result of an EV bleed was defined as hemodynamic instability
and/or death. During endoscopy, the presence of gastric varices
and hypertensive gastropathy were also recorded. Rebleeding
was defined as any novel episode of hematemesis and/or
melena after previous sclerotherapy or banding of the varices.
We recorded the following parameters during surgery and
during follow-up at 6 months: platelets, leucocytes, alkaline
phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino￾transferase (ASAT), total and conjugated bilirubin, gamma￾glutamyltransferase, albumin, activated partial thromboplastin
time, and prothrombin time (PT). We applied the VPR15,16 and
calculated the ASAT-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score.19–21
The VPR is derived from albumin and platelet levels (albumin
 platelets/1,000). The APRI score is commonly used for staging
liver fibrosis and cirrhosis ([ASAT/ULN ASAT]  100/platelets;
where ULNis upperlimit of normal). Using ultrasonography, we
investigated signs of portal hypertension (defined by spleno￾megaly and/or the presence of ascites). Ultrasound findings
were noted when the ultrasound was performed within
3 months of the first endoscopy.
Follow-up was standardized with visits to the KPE center
at 1 and 6 months after KPE and visits to the shared-care
hospital in between. Visits to the KPE center were intensified
if necessary on clinical grounds. Initially, we performed
routine endoscopies upon listing for LTx. Because of frequent
inconclusive results and because of our reluctance to start
primary prophylaxis in very young children (< 3 years), we
now only perform endoscopies in children > 3 years with
indications of portal hypertension at physical examination or
ultrasound (e.g., splenomegaly). Follow-up ended when a
patient died, underwent LTx, or when the end of the study
period had been reached (February 1, 2016).
Data are expressed as median (range) unless otherwise
specified. Continuous variables were compared with the
Mann–Whitney’s U test, categorical data by using the chi￾square test or the Fisher’s exact test. For survival analyses, we
constructed survival curves by using the Kaplan–Meier
method. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank
test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi￾cant. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0.
Results
Patient characteristics are depicted in ►Table 1. Age at KPE
was 62 days (range, 34–128). Follow-up after KPE was
17 months (range, 0–346). Clearance of jaundice was
achieved in 36%. Clearance of jaundice was unknown in eight
patients. Seven patients died before LTx. None of these
children belonged to the bleeding group. Causes of death
were hepatorenal syndrome (n ¼ 2), sepsis (n ¼ 1), cardiac
disease (n ¼ 1), and unknown (n ¼ 3). Four patients were
lost to follow-up. ►Fig. 1 depicts the total survival in the
bleeding and nonbleeding groups.
During follow-up, 18 out of 74 patients (24%) developed
an EV bleed at an age of 9 months (range, 4–111). None of the
patients underwent endoscopy before they suffered EV
bleeding. Time between bleeding and endoscopy was 0.5
days (range, 0–36). ►Fig. 2 depicts the bleeding-free survival
of patients who cleared their jaundice and those who did not.
Three out of 24 (13%) patients who cleared their jaundice
developed EV bleeding versus 15 out of 42 patients (36%)
who did not (p ¼ 0.04). Their age at first EV bleed was
76 months (range, 32–111) versus 7 months (range, 4–75),
respectively (p ¼ 0.03). Twelve out of 18 patients (67%) who
bled from EVs were already listed for LTx at the time of the
first bleed. EV bleeding did not diminish their chance for an
LTx, since all children remained transplantable.
►Table 2 depicts endoscopy findings. A total of 22 patients
were suspected of EV bleeding and underwent diagnostic

and possible therapeutic endoscopy. Indications were hema￾temesis (n ¼ 9, 41%), melena (n ¼ 9, 41%), or a combination
of both (n ¼ 4, 18%). In 4 of these 22 patients, no varices were
seen at endoscopy and thus, following our definition, did
they not bleed from varices. Fourteen patients underwent
endoscopy for other indications without suspicion of an
active EV bleed. Ten patients underwent endoscopy for LTx
assessment at an age of 40 months (range, 5–213), and four
patients underwent endoscopy for clinical suspicion of por￾tal hypertension at an age of 36 months (range, 20–127). EV
bleeds were treated with sclerotherapy (n ¼ 6) or banding
(n ¼ 4). Two patients received simultaneous octreotide ther￾apy. Four patients received octreotide therapy only. Four
patients did not receive treatment because at the time of
endoscopy, no active bleeding focus could be identified.
Nevertheless, varices were present during endoscopy.
Three out of 18 (17%) patients who experienced an EV
bleed had not been assessed for LTx at the time of the first
bleeding episode. All were assessed for LTx later in life.
Indication for LTx assessment was progression of end-stage
liver disease and refractory EV bleeding in the first patient,
and progression of end-stage liver disease in the last two. Of
the 18 patients who experienced an EV bleed, 15 (83%)
ultimately received LTx and 3 (17%) did not. Time between
first bleeding episode and LTx was 1 month (range, 0–43).
In total, 14 patients were treated for their EV bleed.
Rebleeding occurred in 8 out of 14 (57%) patients after initial
sclerotherapy (n ¼ 5), banding (n ¼ 2), or unknown treatment
(n ¼ 1). Age at rebleeding was 12 months (range, 6–80).
Time between first bleed and first rebleed was 2 months
(range, 0–29). One rebleed led to short hemodynamic instabil￾ity, which was treated promptly without severe consequences.
Six of the eight rebleeders underwent LTx within 1 month
after rebleeding, and the other two after 6 and 10 months,
respectively.
None of the patients succumbed as a result of EV bleeding.
Of the 18 patients who suffered an EV bleed, 5 (28%) died. These
deaths, however, all occurred after LTx and were therefore not
further describedin our study. In none of the patients did initial
EV bleeding lead to hemodynamic instability. Transfusion of
RBCs was neededin 5 out of 18 patients (28%). Altogether, 5 out
of 18 patients (28%) were admitted to the intensive care unit,
mostly for postendoscopic evaluation.
►Table 2 depicts laboratory values before surgery and
6 months after KPE, comparing children with and without
EV bleeding. Before surgery AP, total bilirubin, conjugated
bilirubin, and PT were significantly higher in the bleeding
group. Six months after KPE, platelet count, albumin, and thus,
the VPR were significantly lower in the bleeding group.

We compared ultrasound findings between the bleeding
and nonbleeding groups. Ascites was seen in 4 out of 12
patients (33%) in the nonbleeding group versus 8 out of 12
patients (67%) in the bleeding group (p ¼ 0.001). ►Table 3
depicts the findings during endoscopy.
At the time of KPE, we were able to determine the fibrosis
grades of 60 patients. When differentiating between noncir￾rhosis (Grade 1, 2, or 3) and cirrhosis, noncirrhotics devel￾oped EV bleeding in 14 out of 52 cases (27%) versus 2 out of 7
cases (29%) in cirrhotics (p ¼ 0.93).
Discussion
In this study, we set out to clarify the incidence and severity
of EV bleeding in children who had undergone KPE for BA.
Our data suggest that one quarter of BA patients undergoing
a KPE will develop bleeding from EVs. However, major
complications did not occur. The majority will develop EV
bleeding while younger than the age of 1 year, with two￾thirds already listed for transplantation. Earlier studies
established similar results.22,23 Not surprisingly, children
who did not clear their jaundice after KPE appear to be at
higher risk of EV bleeding.
Earlier studies reported incidences ranging from 6.6 to
36%.24–30 Our data showed that 24% of the children with BA
developed EV bleeding at a median age of 9 months. The
incidence seems comparable to earlier studies,while our cohort
bled at a slightly younger age than the cohorts mentioned
previously. This might be due to the relatively low clearance of
jaundice rate, especially at the beginning of our series.
There was no difference in degree of liver damage at KPE
between the bleeding and nonbleeding groups. One would

expect patients in the cirrhosis group to present with bleeding
from varices more often due to the severity of liver disease. Our
results are not in line with a study published by Duché et al in
2006.31 They found that BA patients with elevated portal
pressure at the time of KPE have lower chances of success
following this procedure and run a higher risk of developing
portal hypertension. On the contrary, Kang et al failed to find a
correlation between histologic features of the liver biopsy at
KPE, such as fibrosis and the severity of EVs.32
Our study compared several ultrasound findings between
the bleeding and nonbleeding groups. Ascites was seen more
often in the bleeding group. This is an expected result, as
ascites is an expression of end-stage liver disease.
Our present data are in accordance with previous reports
regarding a generally low mortality of EV bleeding in
children. Nevertheless, individual fatalities after EV bleed￾ings have been reported: 2 out of 13 children with an EV
bleeding30 and 4 out of 44 children who died while listed for
LTx.33 Desai et al found a mortality rate of 5% in BA children
listed for LTx.34 Thus, it appears that an EV bleed can
certainly be fatal, and this was, however, not demonstrated
by our cohort.
In our cohort, patients who would develop an EV bleed
later in life presented with higher total and direct serum
bilirubin levels at the time of the KPE. Lampela et al found
that at 3 months after KPE, a total bilirubin serum level > 40
µmol is a risk factor for bleeding from varices.22 Miga et al
found total bilirubin serum concentration > 4 mg/dL (cor￾responding to approximately > 68 µmol/L) at the time of
bleeding is associated with worse outcome.24
In our cohort, three patients (17%) had not been assessed for
LTx at the time of the first bleeding episode. All were assessed
later in life. In one of these patients, EV bleeding contributed to
commencing assessment for LTx. Due to the retrospective
nature of our study, determining the main indication(s) for
listing for LTx in individual cases was difficult. Our data suggest
that patients are often already listed for LTx when subject to an
EV bleed and that an EV bleed was not likely the sole indication
for LTx.
The VPR is a promising novel predictor of EVs in BA patients
at 6 months after KPE15 and patients with suspected portal
hypertension or gastrointestinal bleeding.16 Our data showed
a significantly lower VPR in the bleeding group. Our results
suggest the VPR could be useful in identifying those patients
who are at highest risk of EV bleeding, and moreover, it might
allow for selective endoscopic evaluation of EVs. This should,
however, be studied in larger, prospective cohorts.
As BA is a rare disease, we were only able to include 74
patients. Because of these low numbers and even lower abso￾lute (however relatively high) number of bleeding episodes
(n ¼ 18), constructing a proper prediction model for EV bleed￾ing was therefore inappropriate, as we would only be able to
include one or two predictor variables.35 We realize it is
difficult to assure that a gastrointestinal bleeding after KPE is
coming from EVs.We, however, aimed to construct a definition
in which all EV bleeds were detected as such, based on studies
previously reported.24,36,37 Moreover, due to the 28-year study
period, we cannot guarantee that the grading of varices, of
gastropathy, and of gastric varices was homogeneous. These are
all weaknesses of the study.
This study contributes to our knowledge on the incidence
and severity of EV bleeding in BA patients. Our data show
that while EV bleeds are relatively common, major complica￾tions are not. Nevertheless, despite adequate treatment,
recurrent bleeds occurred in a significant number of pa￾tients. While ours was a small retrospective series, our
findings do offer further data regarding the incidence and
severity of EV bleeding. Given the absence of major compli￾cations as a result of EV bleeds, the lack of guidelines for
prophylactic treatment for EVs, as well as the lack of suffi￾cient clinical evidence on this subject, endoscopic screening
of all patients with BA for varices, necessitating general
anesthesia, is probably a bridge too far.
Conclusion
A quarter of the children diagnosed with BA experience an EV
bleeding during follow-up, a majority of these children are
younger than the age of 1 year, whilelisted for transplantation.
Major complications did not occur after EV bleeding, possibly
due to rapid LTx after the first bleeding episode.
