Abstract
Introduction: Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are common conditions with high mortality. Their early
diagnosis in the Emergency Department (ED) is one of the keys to improving survival. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been
used as a biomarker in septic patients but has limited specificity and can be elevated in other scenarios of
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Soluble CD14 (sCD14) or presepsin is the free fragment of a
glycoprotein expressed on monocytes and macrophages. Preliminary reports suggest that levels of presepsin are
significantly higher in septic patients than in healthy individuals. The aim of this study is to investigate the
diagnostic and prognostic value of presepsin compared to PCT in people presenting at the ED with SIRS and
suspected sepsis or septic shock.
Methods: This study was conducted in two major hospitals in Turin, Italy. One hundred six patients presenting to
the EDs with suspected sepsis or septic shock were included, and another eighty-three patients affected by SIRS,
but with no clinical evidence of infection, were recruited as controls. Blood samples were collected at first medical
evaluation and for some patients after 24 and 72 h. The samples were analyzed using the PATHFAST Presepsin
assay for sCD14, and commercial kits were used for other determinations (for example, PCT). Definitive diagnosis
and survival rates were obtained afterward by analysis of digital medical records.
Results: Elevated concentrations of presepsin at presentation were observed in septic patients compared to
control patients. The same trend was observed for mean values of PCT. Higher values of presepsin were observed
in septic patients at presentation (time 0). The diagnostic accuracy of PCT was generally higher, and areas under
the curve (AUCs) were 0.875 for PCT and 0.701 for presepsin. Mean presepsin values were significantly higher in
nonsurvivor septic patients (60-day mortality) than in survivors. No significant correlation was noted between PCT
and survival.
Conclusions: In our experience, presepsin was useful in the early diagnosis of infection in a complex population of
patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock who presented to the ED. Presepsin showed a significant
prognostic value, and initial values were significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality of patients affected by
sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock.

Introduction
Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are some of the
most common conditions handled in the Emergency
Department (ED) and ICU, and, despite modern antibio￾tic therapy in conjunction with cardiovascular and
respiratory support, mortality rates remain between 30%
and 60% [1-3]. According to the most recent guidelines,
published in 2013 by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign,
early recognition of these conditions and the speed and
appropriateness of therapy in the initial hours after pre￾sentation are likely to influence the outcomes of septic
patients [4].
More recently, the biomarkers used as diagnostic cri￾teria for sepsis, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) or pro￾calcitonin (PCT) levels more than 2 standard deviations
(SD) above the normal value, are now part of the
inflammatory variables which, together with infection,
whether documented or suspected, constitute a defini￾tion of sepsis [4,5]. There is also good evidence that low
PCT levels or similar biomarkers can be used to assist
the clinician in the critical care areas in the discontinua￾tion of empiric antibiotics in those patients who appear
septic, but have no subsequent evidence of infection [6].
Although PCT has an established role as a biomarker in
septic patients and has been shown to correlate closely
with infection, it has some limitations. It rises transi￾ently in patients with nonseptic conditions and systemic
inflammatory response syndromes (SIRS) (for example,
trauma, surgery, heatstroke) and is not detectable in cer￾tain cases of sepsis. Furthermore, biological predictors of
mortality are absent, clinical scores appear to be of lim￾ited value and the role of PCT as a poor prognostic fac￾tor in patients admitted to the ED because of sepsis
remains to be proved [7]. The ideal biomarker should
retain high sensitivity and specificity and be cost-effec￾tive and promptly available.
Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) is a glycoprotein
expressed on the membrane surface of monocytes and
macrophages and serves as a receptor for complexes of
lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and LPS-binding proteins
(LPBs). By activating a proinflammatory signaling cas￾cade on contact with infectious agents, CD14 has a role
as a pattern recognition molecule in the innate immune
response against microorganisms [8]. During inflamma￾tion plasma protease activity generates soluble CD14
(sCD14) fragments. One of them, called sCD14 subtype
(sCD14-ST), or presepsin, has recently been identified.
Presepsin is normally present in very low concentrations
in the serum of healthy individuals and has been shown
to be increased in response to bacterial infections
according to the severity of disease. Moreover, rapid
dosage methods, based on chemiluminescence enzyme
immunoassay, are available and allow automated mea￾surements in a short time [9,10]. Preliminary studies
suggest that the level of presepsin significantly differs in
healthy individuals and in patients with local infection,
SIRS, sepsis or severe sepsis [11,12]. Presepsin is cur￾rently under investigation in clinical practice as a reli￾able marker of adult and neonatal sepsis [13,14] and for
the postmortem diagnosis of sepsis-related death [15].
On the basis of these premises, we designed a multi￾center prospective study to investigate the diagnostic
role and efficacy, together with prognostic power, of
presepsin, compared to PCT in an adult population pre￾senting to the ED with SIRS (control group) or sus￾pected sepsis or septic shock (study group).
Patients and methods
Patients and design of the study
We conducted a multicenter prospective study of
patients presenting to the ED who met at least two cri￾teria for SIRS and in whom sepsis was suspected to be
the primary or concurrent diagnosis. Informed consent
to participate in the study was obtained from the
patients or their families, and the study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Turin University Hospital
according to the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).
The duration of the study was 1 yr. Between January
2012 and January 2013, 189 patients presenting to the EDs
of San Giovanni Battista University Hospital and Major
Trauma Center Hospital, both in Turin, Italy, were
enrolled. The inclusion criteria were the presence of at least
two clinical criteria for SIRS; suspected diagnosis of sepsis,
severe sepsis or septic shock (according to the guidelines of
the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Criti￾cal Care Medicine and the International Surviving Sepsis
Campaign Guidelines Committee) [16,17]; and patients
who could undergo a blood test. Exclusion criteria were age
less than 18 years old, incapability to give informed legal
consent and evidence of a clearly different diagnosis.
One hundred six patients (43 females, 63 males) pre￾sented at the ED with suspected sepsis or septic shock
and 83 more patients (30 females, 53 males) affected
by SIRS were recruited as controls. In Table 1, the

demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients
enrolled in the study are summarized. Clinical and bio￾chemical data were recorded on admission. Blood sam￾ples were collected at the time of first medical
evaluation (time 0, T0) in the ED before any medical
treatment. Initial Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) score [18] and Acute Physiology and Chronic
Evaluation II (APACHE II) score [19] were calculated in
the ED using clinical parameters and blood test results.
After the first evaluation in the ED, patients were
admitted in intensive care areas (high-dependency unit,
ICU or monitored medical ward). A few patients were
later lost at follow-up; among the rest of them, blood
specimens were collected after 24 hours (time 1, T1)
and 72 hours (time 2, T2) to study the temporal trend
of biomarkers. All the samples were stored at -70°C and
thereafter analyzed blindly for sCD14-ST (presepsin)
and PCT in the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory of Turin
University Hospital. The definitive diagnosis (SIRS, sep￾sis, severe sepsis or septic shock) was made according to
the criteria of the International Guidelines for Manage￾ment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock [4,16] and after￾wards obtained by clinicians by analysis of digital
medical records (Table 2). We evaluated survival on the
basis of 60-day in-hospital mortality, and survival rates
were then blindly matched to biomarker values obtained
at the first evaluation in the ED.
Measurement methods
Blood samples were collected in endotoxin-free tubes
containing ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), centri￾fuged at 3,000 g for 10 min and then stored at -70°C
until being assayed blindly for the presepsin and PCT
measurements. Presepsin was dosed using the PATH￾FAST Immunoanalyzer system (Mitsubishi Chemical
Europe GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany), based on non￾competitive chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay
for the quantitative measurement of the biomarker con￾centration in anticoagulated (heparin or EDTA) whole
blood or plasma. The PATHFAST Presepsin kit (Mitsu￾bishi Chemical Europe GmbH) includes cartridges com￾posed of 16 wells, containing all needed reagents, that
is, magnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal
antibodies against presepsin, alkaline phosphatase
(ALP)-labeled rabbit polyclonal antibodies, chemilumi￾nescent substrate, incubation buffers and washing solu￾tions. Presepsin in the specimen binds to the anti￾presepsin antibodies to form an immunocomplex with
the ALP-labeled antibodies and the antibody-coated
magnetic particles. After removal of the unbound ALP￾labeled antibodies using MAGTRATION Technology
(magnetic particles are directly washed in the dispensing
cap; Precision System Science Europe GmbH, Wörr￾stadt, Germany), a chemiluminescent substrate is added
to the immunocomplex. After a 10-min incubation per￾iod, the luminescence generated by the enzyme reaction
is detected by a photomultiplier to calculate the concen￾tration of presepsin in the samples using the measure￾ment of light emission. The assay takes 17 min using a
sample volume of 100 µl. The entire procedure was
automatically performed using the PATHFAST Immu￾noanalyzer (Mitsubishi Chemical Europe GmbH).
Method precision was tested on three different plasma
pools with a mean presepsin concentration of 327 pg/ml
(range, 700 to 7,201 pg/ml), yielding within-series coeffi￾cients of variation (CVs) of 12.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%,
respectively, as well as between-series CVs of 15.0%,
7.7% and 4.2%, respectively.
Quantitative analysis of PCT was performed using an
automated electrochemiluminescence immunoanalyzer
(ELECSYS* BRAHMS* PCT; Roche Diagnostics, Man￾nheim, Germany). The assay time was 18 min and was
automatically performed on Cobas e601 analyzer plat￾forms (Roche Diagnostics). According to our experience,
within-run and between-run precision for this test were
5.6% and 8.8%, respectively, at 0.15 ng/ml PCT concen￾tration, 4.2% and 5.7% at 1.7 ng/ml, and 2.5% and 4.9%
at 20.3 ng/ml, respectively.
Statistical analysis
The Kruskal-Wallis test with the Bonferroni correction
was used to explore the results in each group (SIRS,
sepsis and severe sepsis or septic shock) at the first pre￾sentation to the ED, to examine the capability of the

two biomarkers to diagnose sepsis, to analyze the differ￾ent primary sites of infection and to compare the differ￾ent populations in the control group (acute pancreatitis,
aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary
syndrome, multiple trauma and burns). The Mann￾Whitney U test was applied to evaluate efficacy regard￾ing 60-day mortality prediction and to analyze the diag￾nostic significance in the different populations in the
group of patients with no infection. Correlations
between biomarkers and blood test results, biomarkers
and SOFA and APACHE II scores were analyzed using
Spearman’s rank correlation test. The Friedman test
with the Bonferroni correction was used to study the
laboratory trend of biomarkers from T0 to T2. A P
value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Statistical tests were performed using MedCalc version
10.0.1.0 statistical software (MedCalc Software, Ostend,
Belgium) and Analyse-it Standard Edition 3.02 software
(Analyse-it Software, Ltd, Leeds, UK) for Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 189 patients were included in the study. Eighty￾three of them presented with SIRS due to acute medical
conditions or trauma and were enrolled in the control
group. Fifty-five patients were diagnosed with sepsis, and
fifty-one had severe sepsis or septic shock. Demographic
characteristics and mean SOFA and APACHE II scores at
presentation are reported in Table 1.
Diagnostic role
The mean presepsin concentrations in plasma were
2,516.4 pg/ml in the control group, 2,866.7 pg/ml
(range, 1,579 to 4,154) in patients affected by sepsis and
3,167.1 pg/ml in the severe sepsis and septic shock
group. Mean levels of PCT in controls, sepsis and severe
sepsis and septic shock patients were 1 ng/ml, 9 ng/ml
and 19 ng/ml, respectively. Median values for presepsin
were 517 pg/ml in controls, 875 pg/ml in septic patients
and 1,460 pg/ml in patients with severe sepsis or septic
shock (Figure 1). Presepsin initial values (T0) were sig￾nificantly different between controls and the sepsis
group (P = 0.002) and between controls and the severe
sepsis and septic shock group (P < 0.001), whereas no
significant difference was noted between the sepsis and
severe sepsis/septic shock groups (P = 0.07). PCT values
at presentation (T0) were conversely significantly differ￾ent between all three groups (Table 3).
Both presepsin and PCT concentrations were signifi￾cantly lower in all nonseptic SIRS patients (acute pan￾creatitis, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, acute
coronary syndrome, multiple trauma and burns) in com￾parison to patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic
shock. Presepsin levels at T0 significantly correlated
with PCT levels at T0 (P = 0.001) and with SOFA score
(P = 0.008). PCT levels at the time of the first medical
evaluation in the ED were significantly correlated with
high values of serum lactate (P = 0.004).
Presepsin and PCT initial values (T0) did not differ
significantly according to the primary sites of infection
(urinary tract, lung, abdomen, skin, central venous
device-related, central nervous system (CNS) and oral
infection) among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock when the starting
focus could be identified (Table 4).
Serial blood tests were obtained for 42 patients to
evaluate the temporal trend of presepsin and PCT.

values at T0 (first medical evaluation in the ED), T1 (24
hours after admission) and T2 (72 hours after admis￾sion) showed significant results. Presepsin displayed the
highest concentration at T0 compared to T1 and T2,
with a significant increasing trend over time (P =
0.0444). The highest PCT concentrations were observed
after 24 hours (T1) in comparison to T0 and T2 (P <
0.001) (Figure 1).
Diagnostic accuracy
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
designed including those patients with a definitive diag￾nosis of sepsis or severe sepsis/septic shock (Figure 2).
The results were significant for both biomarkers. The
areas under the curve (AUCs) calculated from the ROC
curve were 0.701 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63 to
0.77; P < 0.001,) for presepsin and 0.875 (95% CI, 0.82
to 0.92; P < 0.001) for PCT, respectively. The difference
between the two AUCs was significant (P < 0.001). The
best diagnostic cutoff for presepsin was 600 pg/ml. At
that level, sensitivity and specificity were 78.95% (95%
CI, 69.4 to 86.6) and 61.90% (95% CI, 50.7 to 72.3),
respectively. The best diagnostic cutoff in terms of sen￾sitivity and specificity for PCT was 0.18 ng/ml, corre￾sponding to 89.47% sensitivity (range, they actually were
95% CI 81.5% to 94.8%) and 75.90% specificity (range,
65.3% to 84.6%).
Prognostic role
Some patients were lost at the time of 60-day follow-up,
but data for the remaining group were significant and
representative (N = 118). A Kaplan-Meier graph showed
that presepsin values at T0 (first evaluation in the ED)
were correlated with 60-day in-hospital mortality in
patients with sepsis and severe sepsis or septic shock
(Figure 3). Mean initial levels were 4,232.4 pg/ml in
nonsurvivor patients and 3,451.2 pg/ml in survivor
patients (P = 0.04). No significant correlations were
observed between presepsin level at T1 or T2 and survi￾val rates. The comparison between PCT levels at T0 in

Discussion
Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection and can in
some conditions lead to severe sepsis (documented or sus￾pected infection in addition to organ failure or dysfunc￾tion) or septic shock (severe sepsis and hypotension not
responsive to fluid therapy). Severe sepsis and septic shock
are frequently handled in the ED, and, despite modern
antibiotic therapy, mortality rates remain high [20-23].
Early recognition of sepsis is not always straightfor￾ward, and the clinical signs themselves can be misleading,
especially in patients with several comorbidities or vari￾able demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnic group),
such as those who are normally admitted to the ED. Bio￾markers, which were recently introduced among the
inflammatory variables in the diagnostic criteria for sepsis
[4], could contribute to prompt identification of those
patients affected by sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock
who could benefit from quick and appropriate therapy.
Among different molecules which have been suggested
as sepsis biomarkers in recent years, presepsin, or
sCD14, appears quite promising on the basis of its
reported correlation with the early stages of the septic
process [9-15].
We designed a multicenter prospective study to vali￾date the diagnostic and prognostic role of presepsin,
compared to PCT, in the complex setting of the ED.
Patients were recruited during the course of 1 yr in the
EDs of two of the main university hospitals in Turin,
Italy. Patients presenting with at least two clinical
characteristics of SIRS were enrolled, definitive diag￾noses were made according to the criteria of the Inter￾national Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis
and Septic Shock [4], and, according to the retrospective
analysis of the clinical records, the population was
divided into three groups: a control group (patients
affected by SIRS due to acute pathologies such as acute
pancreatitis, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism,
acute coronary syndrome, major trauma or burns, but
with no evidence of infection), patients with sepsis (SIRS
criteria together with documented evidence of infection)
and severe sepsis or septic shock (sepsis and evidence of
organ dysfunction or failure or unresponsive hypoten￾sion). Severe sepsis and septic shock were considered a
unique group because of the similar clinical and prog￾nostic features of these conditions [24]. The three
groups in the study were homogeneous in terms of size
and demographic characteristics.
Presepsin levels at presentation (T0) were significantly
higher in patients affected by sepsis and severe sepsis/
septic shock than in control patients. These data
strongly support the value of this biomarker in the dif￾ferential diagnosis of infection when used in the difficult
case mix of patients with SIRS presenting to the ED. No
difference in presepsin levels was found between the
sepsis and severe sepsis groups, suggesting that the con￾centration of the biomarker is not related to the severity
of disease in the very first hours. The PCT results in
our study population confirmed the high diagnostic
accuracy of this biomarker for sepsis recognition as well
as its correlation with the severity of the disease.
Subpopulation analysis showed no significant correla￾tion between presepsin results and the different popula￾tions in the control group (acute pancreatitis, aortic
dissection, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syn￾drome, major trauma and burns). A significant correla￾tion was found between presepsin and PCT
concentrations at T0 and between presepsin levels and
SOFA score as a severity index of organ failure,
strengthening our hypothesis that presepsin is specifi￾cally increased in patients with more severe infection.
Presepsin concentrations did not correlate significantly
with the primary site of infection (urinary tract, lung,
abdomen, skin, central venous catheter-related, CNS or
oral), when it was possible to identify them using clini￾cal, radiological or microbiological methods. This was
probably due to the fact that presepsin, as with PCT, is
produced systemically by circulating cells, not within a
specific organ or body area.
The role of the new biomarker in monitoring septic
disease was investigated by the analysis of serial mea￾surements, which were performed at T0 (first medical
evaluation in ED), T1 (24 h after admission) and T2
(72 h after the admission). Presepsin values were

significantly higher at T0 than at T1 and T2, whereas
PCT values were higher at T2. These results suggest
that presepsin is an early biomarker for the diagnosis
of sepsis and could play an important role in monitor￾ing of the disease. This decreasing trend could be
related to early clearance or to reduced production as
a consequence of the appropriate treatment in the
initial hours, affecting the systemic and unregulated
immune response of the organism during sepsis. The
role of PCT in monitoring the severity of disease is
well-established and can assist the clinician in deciding
about treatment [5,6].
The ROC curves were significant for both biomarkers,
but the AUC calculated for PCT was wider, demonstrat￾ing a better diagnostic accuracy than presepsin. This
evidence conflicts with what was previously reported by
other groups [9-12], probably due to different criteria in
selecting the study population. We enrolled a more
complex and heterogeneous population of patients pre￾senting to the ED with SIRS and several comorbidities,
thus representing a true, “real-life” scenario. In our
experience, the best diagnostic cutoff for presepsin,
resulting from the ROC curve, was 600 pg/ml, which
was similar to that previously reported by other groups.
The complexity of our population case mix in terms of
age, comorbidities and enrollment criteria is further sup￾ported by the optimal cutoff value calculated for PCT
(0.18 ng/ml), which differs from that currently used in
clinical practice (>2 ng/ml corresponding to high prob￾ability of sepsis).
Analysis of 60-day mortality showed the superiority of
presepsin compared to PCT. Presepsin concentrations at
the first evaluation in the ED were higher in nonsurvi￾vor septic patients than in survivors. No significant cor￾relation was found between PCT values and 60-day
mortality. These results pointed out the possible prog￾nostic role of presepsin in predicting in-hospital mortal￾ity and promptly identifying high-risk patients.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to
address the potential value of presepsin in the clinical
scenario of the ED of two tertiary referral university
centers. Our study population closely resembles the one
ED physicians face in their daily practice, where the
application of laboratory biomarkers may help them to
pick up septic patients with a more severe prognosis to
promptly start the appropriate treatment in the early
hours after presentation. In this setting, presepsin has
proven to be a promising new biomarker that is readily
available, cost-effective and able to distinguish septic
patients in a complex population presenting to the ED
with SIRS. The close correlation between presepsin
initial values and in-hospital mortality suggests its
potential usefulness for the early recognition of high￾risk septic patients, who could benefit from a more
aggressive approach starting in the ED.
Conclusions
Presepsin is a promising new biomarker that is readily
available, cost-effective and able to distinguish septic
patients in a complex population presenting to the ED
with SIRS. Our experience suggests that presepsin can
be used in the ED to promptly identify patients with
SIRS due to severe infection.
The close correlation between presepsin initial values
and in-hospital mortality suggests that this biomarker
could be used to perform an early and reliable risk stratifi￾cation and to identify high-risk patients who could benefit
from a more aggressive approach starting in the ED.
Key messages
• Presepsin is a new biomarker with good specificity and
sensitivity in identifying patients with sepsis-related con￾ditions in the ED.
• Combined use of presepsin and PCT can improve
diagnostic accuracy for sepsis-related conditions in
the ED.
• Presepsin has been shown to retain a prognostic role
and closely correlate with in-hospital mortality of
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
Conflicts of interest
All the authors declare no conflicting interests, financial
support or nonfinancial/academic interests. Presepsin
commercial kits were provided by Mitsubishi Chemical
Medience Corporation without any payment. PCT was
tested as part of a routine assay performed in the emer￾gency departments with no financial support.
