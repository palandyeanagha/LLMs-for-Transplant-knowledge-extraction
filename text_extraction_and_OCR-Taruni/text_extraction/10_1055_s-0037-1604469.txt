Introduction
With an incidence of 5.2 per 100,000 live births, Ebstein’s
anomaly accounts for 1% of all congenital heart disease.1 Its
main features are a pathologic configuration and attachment
of the tricuspid leaflets that lead to severe insufficiency of
the tricuspid valve and a pathologic configuration of the right
ventricle. Additionally, an atrial septal defect (ASD) or a
persistent foramen ovale (PFO) is present in two-thirds of
patients,2 and cyanosis may develop due to interatrial right
to left shunting. The onset of symptoms varies according to
the severity of the disease. Some patients become sympto￾matic as neonates, others as young adults, and some remain
free of symptoms until seniority.3
The anomaly is named after the pathologist, Wilhelm
Ebstein, who first described it in 1866.4 A long time passed
until the diagnosis could be made during lifetime in 1951,
using cardiac catheterization.5 Since around 1980, echocar￾diography simplifies detection and has become the standard
method for diagnosis. The first surgical procedures in pa￾tients with Ebstein’s disease were ASD closures in cyanotic
patients, performed in 1956. The mortality of these proce￾dures exceeded 80%.6 Since the results of isolated ASD
closure were poor, physicians searched for ways to reduce
the insufficiency of the aberrant valve. In 1956, the American
surgeons, Lillehei and Hunter, planned to perform an ASD
closure combined with tricuspid valve repair in a 10-year-old
girl with Ebstein’s anomaly suffering from severe cyanosis.7
Due to the progressed heart disease, the patient died upon
the induction of anesthesia. The two surgeons performed an
autopsy and developed the first concept to repair the Ebstein
valve anomaly. Later, this concept was successfully applied
by Hardy, who performed the first successful repair of an
Ebstein valve in 1963.8 One year earlier, the first valve
replacement in a patient with Ebstein’s disease was per￾formed by Barnard in South Africa.9 Both repair and replace￾ment of the tricuspid valve will be discussed in the section,
“Surgical Techniques.”
Pathologic Anatomy and Pathophysiology
Leaflets
The tricuspid valve develops by delamination of the leaflets
from the underlying myocardium.10 In a healthy individual,
the three leaflets (anterior, posterior, and septal) separate
completely from the myocardium and their hinge point is
located at the tricuspid annulus. In Ebstein’s anomaly, the
delamination process is incomplete and does not reach the
tricuspid annulus. As a result, the leaflets are shortened and
their hinge point lies inside the ventricle. The three leaflets
are not uniformly affected. The septal and the posterior
leaflets are displaced, and the highest degree of displacement

Abstract Surgical repair of the tricuspid valve is a milestone in the medical history of patients
with Ebstein’s anomaly. The timely alleviation of the insufficiency has an important
impact on the prognosis. In this review, we describe features of the disease relevant to
surgical correction and the evolution of surgical techniques over six decades. We
compare the results of different repair and replacement techniques. Additionally, we
discuss concomitant antiarrhythmic surgery and bailout strategies for postoperative
right ventricular failure. Finally, we review the surgical options in symptomatic
neonates with Ebstein’s disease.

is usually present at the internal crux of the heart, at the
commissure between the two leaflets. The septal leaflet is
small or even rudimentary. The anterior leaflet is usually not
displaced and is enlarged rather than shortened. The dis￾placement of the septal and posterior leaflets results in a
rotation of the valve toward the outflow tract11 (►Fig. 1).
Various degrees of connections with the myocardium are
present at all leaflets, leading to their restriction. Often, there
are holes in the leaflets that contribute to the insufficiency.
The leaflets may have a free edge and chordae tendineae, but
in some severe cases, the edge is directly connected to the
myocardium and the papillary muscle.
Ventricle and Myocardium
At the atrioventricular groove, the true tricuspid annulus can
still be identified.11 Due to the partial displacement of the
valve toward the apex, the part of the right ventricle (RV)
between the true and the anatomical tricuspid annulus
becomes functionally a part of the atrium and is referred
to as the “atrialized ventricle.” The tricuspid annulus is
severely enlarged, as well as the right atrium and the RV
(►Fig. 2). However, the functional RV is small compared with
the gigantic right atrium and the atrialized ventricle. The
volume of the entire RV, measured in magnetic resonance
imaging, is two to three times larger compared with a normal
RV.12,13
The myocardium is altered at different sides. At the
atrialized RV, the myocardium is usually thin or even absent.
The wall thickness of the functional RV may be enlarged or
thinned.14 At the left ventricular wall, an increase of inter￾stitial fibrosis may be found.15,16 It is assumed that these
alterations contribute to ventricular dysfunction and heart
failure in Ebstein’s disease.
ASD
In two-thirds of patients with Ebstein’s anomaly, an ASD II/
PFO is present. If the right atrial pressure is elevated, as
typically during exercise, a right to left shunt through the
ASD II ensues. Oxygen saturation of the arterial blood is
usually moderately impaired (80–90% saturation).17 The
right to left shunt on the atrial level may also account for
paradoxical emboli. A quarter of patients beyond 40 years of
age exhibit a history of an event potentially caused by
paradoxical emboli, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack,
brain abscess, or myocardial infarction.18
Rhythm
Patients with Ebstein’s anomaly may present with different
forms of arrhythmia. In one-third of the patients with tachy￾cardia, one or more accessory pathways are present, usually at
the posterolateral side of the RV.19 The enlarged atrium is
susceptible for atrial flutter or fibrillation. ►Table 1 provides
an overview of the most common rhythm disorder in patients
with Ebstein’s anomaly. A potentially dangerous combination
is the presence of an accessory pathway and the occurrence of a
supraventricular tachycardia. The accessory pathway may
conduct the supraventricular tachycardia in a 1:1 ratio to
the ventricle. Accordingly, an atrial fibrillation may transform
into ventricular fibrillation and result in sudden cardiac
death.20 In patients with mild leaflet displacement, arrhyth￾mia may be the most important symptom, and even sudden
cardiac death has been reported in such patients.21
Indication for Surgery
The natural history of Ebstein’s anomaly depends on
the degree of tricuspid valve dysplasia. In 2000, Attie re￾ported on 72 adult patients who had not received operative
treatment.22 After 20 years of follow-up, survival was less
than 10% in patients with a severe displacement of the septal
leaflet (n ¼ 14), 30% in patients with a mediocre displace￾ment (n ¼ 35), and 90% in patients with only minor dis￾placement (n ¼ 23), respectively.

In contrast, long-term survival 20 years after the surgery
is reported to be 70 to 90%.23–25 Thus, surgical treatment of
the tricuspid valve regurgitation improves long-term out￾come. Because both surgical risk and long-term mortality are
increased for patients with advanced disease, surgery should
not be delayed.24 Patients with severe regurgitation beyond
40 years of age should be carefully evaluated with regard to
long-term sequelae of congestion, in particular renal, pul￾monary, and hepatic failure. Severe left ventricular dysfunc￾tion is a risk factor for operative mortality, but it is not a
contraindication for surgery. After surgery, left ventricular
function usually improves.26
Surgical Technique: Repair
Surgical Access
The chest is opened through a median sternotomy. Pericar￾dial traction sutures are placed, and after administration of
heparin, the aorta and the caval veins are cannulated. The
cannula in the superior caval vein should be placed more
cranially, because in selected cases, a cavopulmonary con￾nection might be needed to unload the RV permanently. The
operation is performed under cardiopulmonary bypass with
mild hypothermia on the cardioplegic arrested heart. Several
traction sutures are placed at the right atrium to provide a
perfect exposure of the valve (►Fig. 3).
Plication Techniques
The understanding of the plication techniques of the ven￾tricular wall is a key point for the understanding of the
different repair techniques. The size of the RV is reduced by
folding the wall of the atrialized ventricle.
• The horizontal or transversal plication is intended to
reduce the true tricuspid annulus.
• The longitudinal plication creates a fold from the tricuspid
valve annulus toward the apex, thereby reducing the size
of the annulus as well as of the atrialized ventricle.
Ventricular plication bears the risk for coronary artery
injury. Therefore, the coronary branches are continuously
followed from the epicardium during plication.

Hunter–Lillehei–Hardy Technique
The first concept to repair the Ebstein valve was developed by
Hunter and Lillehei.7 Their goal was to “reestablish” the
physiologic anatomy of the tricuspid valve by bringing the
downward displaced septal and posterior leaflet to the “true”
annulus without detaching the leaflets. This was achieved by
plication of the RV in the horizontal (transverse) plane, i.e., in
parallel to the tricuspid annulus. Stiches are placed from the
base of the septal/posterior leaflet to the corresponding
place at the true annulus. After tiding the sutures, the
atrialized ventricle is excluded.
Danielson Technique
The Danielson technique27 is a modification of the Hardy
technique. Danielson reasonably describes that the septal
part of the atrialized ventricle is not suitable for plication,
because a plication may affect mitral valve function, and the
septum may bulge into the left ventricle. Consequently, the
septal part is still not covered with leaflet tissue after
plication. Therefore, an annular plication at the posterior
part of the right ventricle is added. This brings the anterior
leaflet toward the septum and may enhance the coaptation.
This repair technique results functionally in a monocuspid
valve since the posterior leaflet is almost excluded by the
posterior ring plication and the septal leaflet remains as a
remnant below the coaptation plane.
Carpentier Technique
The plication techniques for the repair of the Ebstein valve
addressed the wrong target; the techniques addressed the
ventricle instead of the leaflets. The leaflets of the Ebstein valve
are “trapped” by multiple attachments, which prevent sufficient
coaptation regardless of how much the ventricle is distorted by
plication. As early as 1958, Lillehei and Hunter stated in their
paper that the plication method was favored because of its
relative ease of use but that a repositioning of the leaflets would
be the more physiologic approach: “This plication maneuver
would appear simpler, quicker, and more feasible than the
previously considered procedure of cutting the leaflets free
and reattaching them in a more normal position.”
7 Surgical
techniques, suture material, cardiopulmonary bypass, and even
cardioplegic arrest were not developed enough to allow for
complicated reconstructions at that time.
Alain Carpentier with his ingenious and structured surgical
imagination was thefirst to address theleaflets for reconstruc￾tion of the Ebstein valve.28Carpentier described the disconnec￾tion of parts of the anterior and the posterior leaflet from the
functional annulus at thehinge point, thereby gaining access to
the multiple attachments behind the leaflets that prevent
leaflet mobility. By dissection of these attachments, the whole
leaflet tissue becomes available for repair. However, the chor￾dae tendineae stay in place. Then, the RV and the true tricuspid
annulus are reduced by performing a longitudinal plication of
the posterior wall. The previously disconnected leaflets are
rotated clockwise and reattached at the true tricuspid valve
annulus. The anterior and posterior leaflets now act as a
bicuspid valve at the height of the true tricuspid annulus. In
adult patients, the annulus is enforced with a ring.
Cone Technique
The cone procedure developed out of the Carpentier repair.29
However, Da Silva’s cone technique takes the severe down￾ward displacement of the septal and part of the posterior
leaflet more into consideration. With Carpentier’s technique,
where the valve is reconstructed in a “horizontal” plane,
some of the displaced leaflet tissue is lost for repair. In
contrast, the “cone valve” is not reconstructed in a “hori￾zontal” plane but in the shape of a cone, predetermined by
the Ebstein morphology.
Together with the posterior leaflet and the displaced part
of the anterior leaflet, the septal leaflet is dissected free and
mobilized extensively (►Fig. 4a–b). Parts of the septal
leaflet are adherent to the ventricular wall and have to be
“peeled off” the myocardium. For each leaflet, a chordae
tendineae or a corresponding ventricular anchoring is re￾tained. Similar to the Carpentier repair, a longitudinal
plication is performed, reducing the size of the ventricle
and true tricuspid annulus (►Fig. 4c–d). The true tricuspid
annulus is further reduced by annular plication to a size
that all three leaflets cover the full circumference of the
annulus (►Fig. 4e–h). The leaflets are longitudinally at￾tached to each other with a running suture such that the
valve, which initially consisted of three separate leaflets is
transformed into a valve with a single circular, cone-shaped
leaflet, covering 360 degrees of the true tricuspid annulus.
Even though the annulus is reduced extensively and the
commissures are closed, there is usually no gradient over
the newly created “cone-valve.”
There are numerous modifications of the cone technique,
including leaflet augmentation, ring annuloplasty, usage of
autologous or artificial chordae, and the Sebening stitch.30
However, in our experience, the consequent application of
the originally described cone technique alone is sufficient for
successful valve construction in the majority of patients.13
Wu Technique
Mobilization of the leaflets and reinsertion at the tricuspid
annulus are performed in the same way as in the Carpentier
repair.31–33 However, instead of a plication, Wu advocates
a resection of a triangular piece of the posterior part of
the atrialized ventricle. Wu further describes the use of auto￾logous pericardium if sufficient septal tissue is missing.32
Hetzer Technique
Hetzer describes various techniques for Ebstein’s repair.25,34
Their key feature is annular plication. The posterior part of
the tricuspid annulus is connected to the septal part of the
tricuspid annulus. In some cases, Hetzer suggested the
creation of a double orifice annulus. By approaching two
points at the opposite side of the true annulus (septal and
anteposterior), two orifices are created. The RV is not pli￾cated and the thin myocardium of the atrialized ventricle
remains in the RV. The leaflets are not mobilized.
Sebening Stitch
The Sebening stitch transfers the chordal attachment of the
papillary muscle of the anterior leaflet to the septum close to

the “true” annulus. This procedure creates a monocusp valve
because the posterior and the septal leaflet are both ex￾cluded. The anterior leaflet, which is usually fairly mobile,
coapts with the septal rim of the “true” annulus. Although
the Sebening stitch alone may result in a sufficient tricuspid
valve,35,36 nowadays, it is mostly performed as an additional
measure in combination with other repair techniques.30,37,38
Surgical Technique: Replacement
The prosthesis is placed at the height of the true tricuspid
annulus. A horizontal plication of the annulus is usually
required. To avoid damage to the atrioventricular (AV)
node, some surgeons suggest to place the septal suture line
in front of the coronary sinus, thus draining the coronary

sinus into the right ventricle.23,39 The valve tissue may be
removed or left in place.39 Tissue near the outflow tract can
cause obstruction and should be removed.23 On the poster￾olateral aspect, the tissue is very thin and the suture line
should therefore be deviated toward the atrium to avoid
coronary artery injury.23 In addition to the valve replace￾ment, the atrialized ventricular myocardium should be re￾duced by plication.40
Surgical Technique: Further Considerations
ASD Closure
ASD closure is recommended by the current guidelines of the
European and American Society of Cardiology.41,42 Usually, a
direct suture is sufficient for the ASD closure. To prevent RV
failure, a residual interatrial shunt may be left. In case of RV
failure, right atrial pressure increases and a right to left atrial
shunt unloads the RV.13,29,43 We recommend to leave a
5 mm ASD in all patients treated with the cone procedure.
If the residual shunt later leads to exercise intolerance and
cyanosis, the ASD may be closed interventionally, but most
patients remain free of any symptoms.13,29 A potential
drawback of the residual interatrial shunt is the remaining
risk of paradoxical embolism.
Antiarrhythmic Strategy
Some studies suggest that after tricuspid valve repair with￾out concomitant antiarrhythmic surgery, two-thirds of pa￾tients who initially present with arrhythmias remain free of
symptoms in the follow-up.44,45 Nevertheless, concomitant
antiarrhythmic surgery should be considered.46 Antiar￾rhythmic surgical procedures may be divided into (1) pro￾cedures for accessory pathways or AV-nodal reentry
tachycardia and (2) procedures for atrial fibrillation or
flutter.
Procedures for accessory pathways or AV-nodal reentry
tachycardia have lost their significance due to catheter
ablation techniques. The intraoperative mapping and dissec￾tion of those pathways was initially introduced by Sealy and
coworkers in 1963.47 This procedure has nowadays become a
rarity, because patients usually undergo catheter ablation
prior to cardiac surgery. Similarly, slow-pathway ablation for
AV-nodal reentry tachycardia is usually performed by cathe￾ter. Nevertheless, Bockeria and coworkers reported in 2005
that intracardial mapping and ablation accessory pathways
had a higher success rate than the transcatheter ablation in
patients with Ebstein’s anomaly.48
In contrast to the abandoned surgical procedures for
accessory pathways, the maze procedure for atrial flutter
is a current and successful antiarrhythmic surgical proce￾dure. The placement of a set of ablation lines creates a maze
for the electrical activation on the atrial wall. Instead of a
planar propagation, the electrical activity propagates inside
numerous blind-ending paths. Thus a (macro-) electrical
circuit resulting in atrial fibrillation of flutter is prevented.49
Both a maze limited to the right side and biatrial maze are
applied successfully in patients with Ebstein’s anomaly, with
a success rate of 93%.50 Some surgeons recommend the
addition of a cavotricuspid ablation line even in patients
without previous arrhythmia to prevent isthmus-dependent
flutter.50
Bailout in Case of Right Heart Failure
Cardiac decompensation due to impaired RV function is a
major concern after tricuspid valve surgery for Ebstein’s
disease, since afterload may be increased by the compe￾tency of the tricuspid valve when the blood is ejected only
into the pulmonary artery. Consequently, RV stroke volume
and ejection fraction decrease. On the other hand, volume
load, i.e., preload of the right ventricle is also reduced and
in most cases, may compensate for the increase in the
afterload. In the early postoperative phase, beginning with
weaning from the heart lung machine, the risk for RV
failure is high.13 A temporary solution is to unload the
RV by extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the
postoperative phase.13 A permanent solution is the crea￾tion of a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (Glenn
anastomosis). This “one and a half ventricle repair” can
only be performed if pulmonary artery pressure is not
elevated.51,52 In patients with a 1.5 ventricle repair, the
flow over the tricuspid valve is diminished, and a mechan￾ical prosthesis should be avoided due to increased risk of
thrombosis.53

Repair versus Replacement
In a single-center study from the Mayo Clinic, Brown and
coworkers found no difference in survival following replace￾ment and repair (Danielson technique).23 In patients below
12 years of age, freedom from reoperation was lower after
repair than after replacement. There was no difference in
freedom from reoperation in patients over 12 year of age
(80% after 10 years). Today, repair is generally considered as
the first-line treatment.
Replacement: Biological versus Mechanical
In a recent retrospective study, Brown and coworkers re￾ported similar rates of reoperation after implantation of a
mechanical or biological prosthesis in patients with Ebstein’s
disease. However, survival was longer after the implantation
of a biological prosthesis.54 An important limitation of this
study is that age was significantly higher in patients under￾going replacement with a mechanical device. Furthermore,
69% of the mechanical valves were ball and cage prostheses,
which meanwhile have been replaced by bileaflet valves.
Barlett and coworkers performed a retrospective multicenter
study including children below 6 years of age undergoing
tricuspid valve repair. While there was no significant differ￾ence in survival after replacement using a mechanical or
biological prosthesis, the use of a mechanical prosthesis was
associated with a higher rate of failure (twofold) and a higher
risk for pacemaker implantation (13-fold).55 Generally, a
biological prosthesis should be recommended independent
of the age of the patient. These prostheses may become
dysfunctional early, especially in patients younger than
16 years of age, but a redooperation can be performed
with a low mortality.56
Some authors suggest that due to the low opening and low
closing pressure at the tricuspid position, porcine bioprosth￾eses are more suitable compared with pericardial bioprosth￾eses because of their thinner leaflet tissue.53
Types of Repair
Till date, no comparative study among different types of
repair has been performed. Both the Mayo Clinic (2008,
Danielson technique)23 and the German Heart Centre
Munich (2010, predominantly Sebening stitch)24 reported
an excellent early and long-term survival after repair but
considerable rate of reoperation in the long-term follow-up
(36 and 38% reoperation after 20 years). In contrast, the
group of the Hospital George Pompidou, Paris (2003, Car￾pentier technique)57 reported considerably less reoperations
in the long-term follow-up than the other two groups. Like￾wise, the percentage of repair procedures (98%) was higher
compared with the German Heart Centre (90%) or the Mayo
Clinic (34%). In 2007, the group of the Hospital Beneficencia
Portuguesa, Sao Paolo (cone technique) reported an excellent
survival and few need for reoperation29 in 40 consecutive
patients with Ebstein’s anomaly.
In consequence of the excellent results from the group in
Sao Paolo with the cone repair, many groups with an
extensive experience in the repair of Ebstein’s anomaly
such as the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,30 the German Heart
Centre in Munich,13 the great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick
Children in London,58 and the Children’s Hospital in Boston59
switched to this technique. Furthermore, the cone technique
was adopted by the two highly frequented hospitals—West
China Hospital, Chengdu60 and the Shanghai Children’s
Medical Center.61 It is noteworthy that the favorable results
with regard to mortality, valve competency, and the high
percentage of achieved repair could be reproduced by all of
these groups. Furthermore, MRI measurements show a
major change in RV size and shape after the cone repair. At
the German Heart Centre, the preoperatively indexed end￾diastolic volume of the functional RV was 191 mL2 (normal
value: 75 mL/m2
) and was reduced to 123 mL/m2 6 months
after the repair. The group of Chengdu reported similar
results (index preoperative RV end-diastolic volume:
134 mL/m2 reduced to 97 mL/m2 postoperatively). According
to the law of Laplace, a reduction of RV diameter results in a
reduction in wall stress. Thus, there is a good reason to
assume that the cone repair may prevent a later heart failure.
The RV ejection fraction remains impaired in the midterm
follow-up, but the regurgitation volume decreases. The net
result is an increased flow over the pulmonary artery13 and
an improved left ventricular filling.58 Cardiopulmonary ex￾ercise testing displays an improved functional status in the
midterm follow-up after the cone repair.
Special Case: Newborn
Pathology
During the first weeks of life, a newborn with Ebstein’s
disease may present with an aggravated physiologic condi￾tion. Right ventricular function is impaired by the presence
of severe tricuspid valve insufficiency. At the same time, the
pulmonary pressure is physiologically elevated, putting ad￾ditional stress on the RV. In this situation, severe congestive
failure may evolve rapidly and the patients may have to
be assigned to surgery in the neonatal period. However, in
some cases, symptoms may diminish with the physiologic
decline in pulmonary artery pressure. The therapeutic goal in
severe neonatal Ebstein anomaly is not “earliest surgery,” but
medical management including measures to reduce the
pulmonary vascular resistance (even with prostaglandin
infusion in the beginning). When weaning from prostaglan￾din E fails, it serves as an indication for an early surgery.
Celermajer and coworkers developed an echocardiographic
score (Great Ormond Street Echo score, GOSE score) to help
the physicians in this situation to decide between an early
surgery or medical treatment until later repair61 (►Fig. 5).
Accordingly, the disease can be graduated, and a mortality
risk can be determined (►Table 3).
Palliation: Starnes Procedure
The first series on successful palliative surgery in neonatal
patients with Ebstein’s disease was published in 1991 by
Starnes.62 In this procedure, the tricuspid valve orifice is
closed with a membrane at the true tricuspid annulus and
the pulmonary artery is ligated. An atrioseptectomy and a
modified Blalock–Taussig shunt are added.

A certain amount of blood still drains into the RV via the
perforant veins. In a later experience of the Starnes group (16
patients), the importance of leaving a small hole in the
membrane was emphasized to decompress the RV.63,64
This improved survival after a mean follow-up of 27 months
from 66 to 80%.
Correction: Knott–Craig
In 2000, Knott Craig and coworkers published three cases of
neonates with Ebstein’s anomaly undergoing repair of the
tricuspid valve.65 GOSE-scores were 1.3, 1.8, and 2.4 with a
high probability of death without surgery.61 The authors
created a monocuspid valve consisting of the anterior leaflet
only and added a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.
An annular plication was performed by placing a suture with
one pledgeted end at the anterior–posterior commissure and
the other pledgeted end at the coronary sinus. By connecting
these two points, the annulus is divided into a bigger orifice
(containing the anterior valve and part of the remnants of the
septal valve) and a smaller orifice at the posterior wall
(containing the posterior valve). The smaller orifice is closed
by a running suture. At the bigger orifice, the anterior leaflet
can coapt with the septum and act as a monocuspid valve. As
a further modification, the septal leaflet may be detached at
the annulus if the anterior leaflet is adherent and therefore
not able to coapt with the septal wall.66 At the place of the
detachment, a patch is inserted to enlarge the anterior
leaflet.
In 2011, the group of Knott–Craig reported 32 neonates
and young children, of which 90% underwent biventricular
repair. GOSE score was  1 in all patients and  1.5 in 22
patients. Early mortality was 22% and there was one late
death.67 Freedom from reoperation after 15 years was 75% in
patients undergoing biventricular repair.
Recently, most centers with extensive experience with the
cone procedure have also started to apply this technique in
newborn children if there is enough valve tissue for the
reconstruction. Since it is still a preliminary experience, this
information is based on personal communication only.
Conclusion
Surgical repair of Ebstein’s anomaly has been a challenge for
decades. Since the first description by Hunter and Lillehei in
1957, many different repair techniques have evolved. Plica￾tion procedures alone yielded acceptable results but were
characterized by a considerable reoperation rate. With the
advent of complex leaflet reconstruction techniques, such as
the Carpentier and the cone reconstruction, a more physio￾logic repair became available. In particular, the cone recon￾struction shows very promising results and may become the
technique of choice for patients with Ebstein’s anomaly.
