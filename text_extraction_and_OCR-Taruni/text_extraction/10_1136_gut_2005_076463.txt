Introduction: Impaired activity of natural killer (NK) cells has been proposed as a mechanism contributing
to viral persistence in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. As the function of NK cells is primarily regulated by
NK cell receptors (NKR), we analysed whether decreased NK cell function in hepatitis C may be related to
dysregulated NKR expression.
Patients and methods: Expression of NK cell was analysed by flow cytometry on lymphocytes from HCV(+)
subjects (n = 30), patients who became HCV(2) after antiviral therapy (n = 10), healthy individuals
(n = 10), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients (n = 9). Cytolytic function of lymphocytes was studied
in a redirected lysis assay and in a standard 51chromium release cytotoxicity assay, respectively.
Results: In patients with chronic hepatitis C, we found a significantly reduced proportion of NKp46 and
NKp30 expressing NK cells compared with healthy and HBV infected subjects. Low expression of natural
cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) was also confirmed in in vitro activated NK cell populations derived from HCV
patients compared with uninfected donors. In contrast, patients who cleared HCV under antiviral therapy
showed normal expression of NKp44, NKp30, and NKp46. Reduced NCR expression in chronic hepatitis
C was associated with a parallel decrease in NCR mediated target cell killing. Furthermore, we found a
significantly increased proportion of NKG2A expressing NK cells and CD8+ T cells in HCV positive
patients, resulting in a reduced cytolytic activity against cells incubated with the HLA-E stabilising peptide
HCV core35–44.
Conclusion: The present study indicates that defective expression of NKR represents a novel mechanism
contributing to impaired function of NK cells and CD8+ T cells in chronic hepatitis C.
I
mpaired activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes1–3 as well as
dysfunction of natural killer (NK) cells4–8 has been
suggested to be critically involved in the establishment of
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, the
mechanisms leading to suppressed function of NK cells and
CD8+ T cells are only poorly understood.
The function of NK cells is regulated by multiple cell
surface NK cell receptors (NKR)9 which can be divided into
activating and inhibitory NKR. Furthermore, recent reports
have demonstrated that NKR are also importantly involved in
the regulation of immune functions elicited by CD8+ T
cells.10–12 Thus altered expression of NKR is likely to result in
altered functions of NK cells and CD8+ T cells. With respect
to hepatitis C, Khakoo et al showed that genes encoding the
inhibitory NK cell receptor KIR2DL3 and its human leucocyte
antigen C group 1 (HLA-C1) ligand directly influence
resolution of HCV infection, supporting the importance of
NKR for the course of hepatitis C.13
The diversity of NK cell receptors observed in different
individuals is in part genetically determined.14 On the other
hand, microbial infections may modify the NKR repertoire as
increased proportions of CD8+ T cells bearing inhibitory
NKG2A have been observed in mice infected by different
viruses12 15 16 as well as in human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV),17 and HCV infected patients.18
Inhibitory NKG2A as well as activating NKG2C belong to
the C-type lectin NKR and both specifically recognise the
non-classical major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) I
molecule HLA-E, which presents peptides commonly derived
from the signal sequences of other MHC class I molecules.19–21
Of note, we recently demonstrated enhanced expression of
HLA-E on a variety of intrahepatic cells in chronic hepatitis C.
Furthermore, we showed that the hepatitis C virus poly￾protein gives rise to at least one peptide (HCV core aa35–44;
YLLPRRGPRL) that stabilised surface expression of HLA-E
and thus inhibited NK cell function.22
Activation of NK cells is primarily mediated by the natural
cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) NKp46, NKp30, and NKp44.23
The cell surface ligand(s) of these NCR is still unknown.24
However, NK cell mediated cytolytic activity has been shown
to be strictly correlated with NCR density,25 26 and reduced
expression of NKR in HIV RNA(+) patients has been shown
to be associated with reduced lytic function of NK cells.27
Apart from modulating NK cell function, NKR are also
importantly involved in tuning T cell responses. Activation of
T cells is primarily induced by signals generated by direct
interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with antigen,
presented via MHC I molecules on antigen presenting cells.28
In addition to positive signals via the TCR, the magnitude of
CD8+ T cell activation also depends on signals mediated by
NKR expressed on T cells,10–12 28 including CD94/NKG2A/C
and NKG2D, another member of the C-type lectin family.10
There is increasing evidence that inhibitory NKRs such as
NKG2A are importantly involved in regulation of CTL
functionality.10–12 For instance, Speiser et al demonstrated
that the weak cytolytic activity of in vitro expanded NKG2A
positive melanoma specific CTL can be restored by blocking
CD94/NKG2A with a specific antibody.10 11 29
Here we determined expression of activating (NKp30,
NKp46, NKp44, NKG2C, and NKG2D) and inhibitory
(NKG2A) NKR on NK cells and CD8+ T cells of patients
chronically infected with HCV and correlated changes in

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
Forty Caucasian individuals, all from the Bonn area in
Germany, were enrolled into this study. Thirty patients had
chronic hepatitis C and 10 subjects had cleared the virus after
combined antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon a and
ribavirin. None of these patients had histological signs of liver
cirrhosis. As control groups, we also studied 10 healthy HCV
RNA negative donors and nine hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infected patients (table 1).
NK cells were immunomagnetically purified from periph￾eral blood mononuclear cells according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Serum
samples were collected and stored at 280˚C until use.
The study conformed with the guidelines of the
Declaration of Helsinki, as approved by our ethics committee.
FACS analysis
The following antibodies were used for FACS analysis: anti￾CD56-FITC, anti-CD8-APC, and anti-CD3-PercP were
obtained from BD (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany).
Anti-NKG2A-Pe, anti-NKG2C-Pe, and anti-NKG2D-Pe were
purchased by R&D (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany),
and anti-NKp30-PE, anti-NKp44-Pe, and anti-NKp46-Pe
were obtained from Beckman Coulter (Heidelberg,
Germany). After incubation of the cells with 10 ml of
antibody for 20 minutes and washing in phosphate buffered
saline, samples were analysed on a FACScalibur using
CellQuest software.
Flow cytometric analysis of cells in the liver specimens
Liver biopsy specimens for flow cytometric analysis of
intrahepatic cells were obtained from liver biopsies of five
HCV RNA(+) patients and four control subjects with hepatic
diseases not related to HCV using 1.5 mm diameter
disposable biopsy needles. Fresh liver samples were washed
twice in fresh medium and shaken gently to avoid blood
contamination. Liver specimens were disrupted mechanically
into small fragments in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal
calf serum FCS using a forceps and scalpel. Then the
fragments were homogenised on a cell strainer (BD
Labware, Heidelberg, Germany). The resulting cell suspen￾sion was washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium.
Intrahepatic cells were then directly analysed by flow
cytometry.
Cell culture conditions
After immunomagnetic purification, NK cells were cultured
in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) at
100 U/ml (Proleukin; ChironCorp., Emeryville, California,
USA), and 1.5 ng/ml of PHA (Gibco Ltd, Paisley, UK) to
obtain activated polyclonal NK cell populations.25 27 The
culture medium was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, L-glutamine (2 mM/l), and penicillin, and
NK populations were analysed two weeks after purification/
activation.27
Redirected cytotoxicity assay
Fc dependent redirected cytotoxicity was studied as described
previously.30 In brief, NCR mediated lytic activity was studied
after a four hour incubation of isolated NK cells with 51Cr
labelled FccR+ P815 cells at various E:T ratios. The function of
NCR was analysed by adding soluble anti-NKp30 (clone
210847), NKp44 (clone 253415), or anti-NKp46 (clone
195314), all obtained from R&D Systems.. The increase in 51Cr release over baseline (irrelevant monoclonal antibody)
reflects the ability of a given monoclonal antibody to trigger
the lytic machinery of the cells. As a negative control we used
an IgG specific monoclonal antibody (clone A85-1; BD
Biosciences).
Accordingly, purified CD8+ T lymphocytes were incubated
with anti-CD3 and soluble anti-NKG2A to asses the effect of
NKG2A stimulation on TCR mediated lytic activity of CTL. To

analyse the functional role of CD94, we added anti-CD94
instead of NKG2A. As a negative control, we used an IgG
specific monoclonal antibody (clone A85-1). In further
control experiments anti-CD94 or anti-NKG2A were added
without anti-CD3. 51Cr release was measured with a b counter. Maximum
release was determined by addition of Triton X. Specific
lysis was calculated as (release 2 spontaneous release) :
(maximum release 2 spontaneous release) 6100.
Cytotoxicity assay
A 51chromium release assay was performed as described
previously31 using K-562 and HLA-E transfected K-562
HLA-E cells as target (T) cells and purified NK cell
populations as effector (E) cells. Prior to performing the
assay, 16104 target cells were incubated overnight at 26˚C in
the absence or presence of peptide HCV core aa35–44
(100 mM) to load peptides onto HLA-E molecules.22
To identify the type of NK cell receptor involved, we also
preincubated NKL cells with either anti-CD94 or anti-NKG2A
antibody at 10 mg/ml before performing the cytotoxicity
assay. As a negative control, NK cells were incubated with
an irrelevant mouse IgG specific antibody (clone A85-1; BD
Biosciences). E:T ratios were varied as indicated for the
different experiments. Specific lysis was calculated as
(release 2 spontaneous release):(maximum release – spon￾taneous release) 6100.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses (Student and Mann-Whitney U tests,
respectively) were performed with the SPSS 9.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, Illinois, USA) statistical package. Results were
considered significant at the two sided p level of 0.05.
RESULTS
Circulating CD3(2)CD56(+) NK cells as a percentage of total
circulating lymphocytes did not differ significantly between
the four analysed groups (fig 1A). However, flow cytometric
analysis of C-type lectin receptor surface expression on NK
cells (fig 1B) revealed an enhanced proportion of NKG2A
expressing NK cells in HCV infected patients (52.3 (5.2)%) in
comparison with healthy controls (16.7 (3)%; p,0.001).
Unlike patients with hepatitis C, HBV infected patients
showed NKG2A expression comparable with that of healthy

subjects (fig 1C, left diagram). No significant differences
were found between healthy controls and patients with
chronic viral hepatitis regarding expression of NKG2C and
NKG2D (fig 1C).
Next, we addressed the functional consequences of
upregulated expression of the inhibitory NK cell receptor
NKG2A, which specifically interacts with HLA-E. To this end,
we isolated NK cells from peripheral blood of HCV infected
patients and healthy volunteers. Purified NK cells were tested
in a 51chromium release assay using HLA-E transfected
K-562 (K-562 B5) cells as target cells. K-562 B5 cells were
pulsed with peptide HCV core aa35–44, which has been
shown to stabilise surface expression of HLA-E.22 NK cells
from HCV infected patients showed markedly reduced lysis of
peptide pulsed B5 cells compared with NK cells from healthy
individuals. Blocking with anti-NKG2A confirmed that this
reduced lysis of HLA-E expressing cells was due to interac￾tions of NKG2A with HLA-E (fig 1D, and data not shown).
Regarding expression of NCR, we found a significantly
lower percentage of NKp30 expressing NK cells in HCV
infected than in healthy controls (mean 35.9 (SEM 4.6)% v
77.5 (3.3)%; p,0.001) and HBV patients (60.9 (8.9)%;
p = 0.017) (fig 2A). Staining of NK cells from HCV patients
with the NKp46 specific antibody was also significantly

reduced compared with staining of cells from HCV RNA
negative subjects (53.7 (5.6)% v 84.4 (4.6)%; p = 0.015) and
patients infected with HBV (77.6 (6.9)%; p = 0.024) (fig 2A).
In contrast, no significant differences were found regarding
percentage of NKp44 expressing CD56+ NK cells (figs 2A).
To address the issue of whether reduced expression of
NKp30 and NKp46 is associated with replicative HCV
infection, we studied surface expression of NCR in patients
who had cleared the virus after antiviral therapy with
pegylated interferon a and ribavirin. Interestingly, we found
that aviraemic patients showed a significantly higher
proportion of NKp30 positive (79.5 (4.5)%; p,0.001) and
NKp46 positive (84 (4.5)%; p = 0.005) NK cells than HCV
RNA positive patients, comparable with expression levels in
healthy controls (fig 2A). There was a positive correlation
between proportions of NKp30 positive and NKp46 positive
NK cells in chronic hepatitis C (fig 3B). However, no positive
correlation was found between expression levels of any of the
NCR and serum HCV loads (fig 3A).
Recently, we demonstrated that expression of NKG2A was
upregulated on intrahepatic NK cells in HCV infection and
exceeded expression of NKG2C.22 However, nothing is known
of expression of NCR on liver infiltrating NK cells. Therefore,
we stained intrahepatic CD3(2)CD56(+) lymphocytes for
expression of NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, respectively. We
found a comparable proportion of NCR positive NK cells in
peripheral blood and in the livers in chronic hepatitis C,
although some patients showed higher expression of NKp30
on intrahepatic compared with circulating NK cells (fig 2B).
Nevertheless, we observed a significantly lower percentage of
NK cells expressing NKp30 and NKp46 in livers from HCV
infected patients than in livers from patients with non-HCV
associated hepatic diseases (fig 2C).
Next we analysed whether reduced expression of NCR on
purified peripheral blood NK cells from HCV RNA positive
patients could also be confirmed after NK cells were activated
and cultured in vitro. For this purpose, we cultured purified
NK cell populations from peripheral blood of HCV infected
patients or from healthy uninfected controls in the presence
of rIL-2, as described previously.27
Flow cytometric analysis of NKp30 and NKp46 revealed
that these receptors were still expressed at reduced levels in
the in vitro activated NK cell cultures derived from HCV RNA
positive patients. In addition, expression of NKp44, which is
usually upregulated by in vitro culture of NK cells, was also
reduced on NK cells isolated from HCV infected patients
compared with NK cells from healthy subjects (fig 4A).
To check whether reduced expression of NCR also has a
functional correlate, we analysed the lytic function of NK
cells from HCV infected patients in a redirected killing assay.
In these experiments, the cytolytic activity of NK cell
populations was assessed against the FcR+ P815 murine
target cell line, in the absence or presence of monoclonal
antibody directed at NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, as described
before.27
We found a significant overall decrease in median NCR
mediated lysis of P815 targets in the redirected killing assay.

RNA positive patients in the presence of NKp46, NKp30, or
NKp44 specific monoclonal antibody represented approxi￾mately 50% of what was observed for the NK cell populations
obtained from healthy controls (fig 4B).
Finally, we studied expression and function of NKR on
CD8+ T cells in chronic hepatitis C. No differences were found
regarding numbers of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes
(fig 5A) between the groups. Furthermore, we did not find
expression of NCR on CD8+ T cells (data not shown), which
is in line with previous reports.32–34 However, analysing
expression of C-type lectin receptors (fig 5B), we found a
significantly higher percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes
expressing the inhibitory NK cell receptor CD94/NKG2A in
HCV RNA positive patients (mean 15.4 (SEM 2.9)%) than in
healthy individuals (5.6 (0.5)%; p = 0.003) or in patients with
chronic hepatitis B (5.42 (1.9)%; p = 0.002). Patients who
cleared HCV RNA after combined therapy with interferon and
ribavirin displayed NKG2A expression comparable with that
of healthy individuals (6.7 (1.9)%) (fig 5C). Expression of
NKG2A was closely related to HCV serum levels (r = 0.543,
p = 0.045; data not shown), indicating that NKG2A expres￾sion was related to HCV replication.
In contrast, no statistically significant differences were found
for expression of NKG2C (5.3 (1.2)% v 6.0 (0.8)%; p.0.05) and
NKG2D (94.4 (0.5)% v 83.0 (6.5)%; p.0.05) between HCV RNA
positive and healthy subjects. However, NKG2C was signifi￾cantly lower on CD8 T lymphocytes from patients who became
HCV negative after antiviral therapy (2.9 (0.5)%) compared
with lymphocytes from both HCV RNA(+) patients (p = 0.037)
and healthy controls (p = 0.001). No differences were found
regarding expression of NKG2D (fig 5C).
Multicolour analysis of CD3(+)CD8(+) T revealed that most
of the CD3+ CD8+ NKG2A+ lymphocytes were CCR72,
CD282, CD45RA2, and CD45RO+, indicating a memory
phenotype (data not shown).
To examine the functional effect of enhanced NKG2A
expression in chronic hepatitis C, we used a redirected lysis
assay as described previously.30 Stimulation of purified
CD3(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes with a NKG2A specific anti￾body alone did not induce target lysis (data not shown).
However, costimulation of the T cell receptor with anti-CD3
together with NKG2A using anti-NKG2A resulted in mark￾edly reduced TCR mediated cytolysis compared with CD8+ T
lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 and an IgG isotype
control antibody when T lymphocytes from HCV RNA
positive patients were used as effector cells (fig 6A, right
panel). In contrast, only small effects were observed when
CD3+
CD8+ cells from HCV RNA negative or healthy indivi￾duals were analysed in TCR/NKG2A costimulation experi￾ments (fig 6A, left and middle panels).
As some (,10%) NKG2A positive CD8+ T lymphocytes also
expressed the activating NKR NKG2C, which also forms
heterodimers with CD94, we repeated the costimulation
experiments using anti-CD94 instead of anti-NKG2A.
Engagement of CD94 also resulted in reduced lytic function
of CTL from HCV RNA positive patients (fig 6B).
DISCUSSION
Natural killer cell receptors are important regulators of NK
cell9 27 32–36 and CD8+ T cell functions.10–12 37 Regarding the fact
that impaired activities of NK cells4–6 8 22 and CD8(+) T cells1–3
have been reported in chronic HCV infection, we analysed

whether dysregulated expression of NKR on these lympho￾cyte subpopulations might be involved in the inefficient
cellular immune responses observed in chronic hepatitis C.
Concerning C-type lectin receptors, we found enhanced
expression of the inhibitory NKG2A receptor on both NK cells
and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. The natural ligand for the
inhibitory NKG2A receptor is the non-classical MHC I
molecule HLA-E.22 Recently, we demonstrated that HCV
infected hepatocytes express enhanced levels of HLA-E.
Moreover, we showed that the HLA-A2 restricted epitope
HCV core aa35–44 stabilises HLA-E expression resulting in
impaired cytolysis mediated by NK cells.22 Corroborating
these findings, we now demonstrate that enhanced surface
expression of NKG2A on NK cells from HCV infected patients
is associated with reduced cytotoxic activity against HLA-E
expressing cells. In addition to direct impairment of cytotoxic
function, inhibition of NK cell activity by upregulated
NKG2A may have further consequences. For instance,
enhanced expression of NKG2A has also been shown to
result in altered NK cell induced modulation of dendritic cell
functions in chronic hepatitis C.8
Regarding CD8+ T cells, expression of NKG2A has been
suggested to be involved in fine tuning of T cell responses by
raising the threshold for TCR triggering,38 thereby serving as a
mechanism for peripheral tolerance.10 In line with this
concept, the CD94/NKG2A receptor has been shown to
inhibit cytokine production and cytolytic activity of antigen
specific T cells,39 and the inability of antiviral CD8+ T cells to
control virus induced tumours has been attributed to
upregulation of CD94/NKG2A receptors on T cells.12 In line
with this hypothesis, upregulation of NKG2A due to chronic
exposure to a pathogen might be a mechanism to prevent
clonal exhaustion by terminal differentiation or to suppress
excessive immunopathological responses. On the other hand,
a premature shut off of the antiviral CTL response due to
induction of NKG2A would facilitate viral persistence and
thus could contribute to viral immune evasion.11 12 We found
that enhanced NKG2A expression on CD8+ T cells in chronic
hepatitis C was associated with impaired cytolytic function of
T cells when NKG2A was costimulated with the TCR. In line
with the findings of Jabri and colleagues,11 we also found that
engagement of CD94 instead of NKG2A, which simultan￾eously stimulates NKG2A and NKG2C, resulted in TCR
inhibition. Thus engagement of inhibitory NKG2A is domi￾nant over engagement of activating NKG2C, which was also
present on CD8+ T cells. Similar to what was observed for NK
cells, we found reduced cytolytic activity of CD8+ T cells from
HCV infected patients against HLA-E expressing cells. Thus
simultaneous upregulation of NKG2A and its ligand HLA-E
in chronic hepatitis C might represent an effective viral
strategy to evade immune surveillance by acting on both NK
cells and CD8+ T cells.
In contrast with C-type lectin receptors, the NCR NKp30,
NKp44, and NKp46 are selectively expressed on NK cells.32–34
Analysing intrahepatic as well as circulating lymphocyte
populations, we observed that chronic hepatitis C was
associated with a reduced percentage of NKp30 and NKp46
expressing CD56+ NK cells.
Dysregulated expression of NCR in hepatitis C resembles
recent findings by De Maria and Moretta who demonstrated
significantly reduced surface expression of NKp30 and
NKp46, but not NKp44, in HIV-1 infected patients.27 In line
with our results, this group also found that altered NCR
expression was associated with a reduced lytic capability of
NK cells. Thus downregulated expression of NCR seems to be
a mechanism used by several different viruses to counteract

Figure 6 NKG2A mediated inhibition of CTL cytotoxicity. (A) Using a redirected cytolytic assay of P815 cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti￾NKG2A monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or isotype control (anti-IgG mAb), we studied the function of NKG2A receptors in purified CD8(+) T cells derived
from healthy individuals, subjects who became hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA negative after antiviral therapy, or HCV RNA positive patients without
therapy. As illustrated, we found that CD8(+) T cells from patients with replicative hepatitis C showed reduced cytolytic activity when NKG2A was
costimulated with CD3. (B) If a CD94 specific mAb was used instead of anti-NKG2A to analyse the effects of NK cell receptors (NKR) on cytolytic
function in NKG2A/NKG2C double positive CD8+ T cells derived from HCV RNA negative and HCV RNA positive subjects, simultaneous engagement
of NKG2A and NKG2C by stimulation of CD94 in the redirected lysis assay resulted in markedly impaired cytolytic activity of CD8(+) T cells in HCV
RNA(+) patients. *p,0.05, HCV(+) versus HCV(2).

NK cell function. However, our findings that HBV infection is
not accompanied by reduced expression of NCR suggests that
downregulation of NCR is a specific phenomenon linked to
distinct viruses. Furthermore, our finding of lower numbers
of NCR expressing NK cells in HCV(+) livers than in livers of
patients with hepatic diseases not associated with hepatitis C
argues against a general reduced expression of NCR due to
hepatic inflammation.
The mechanism(s) operative in regulation of NKR is at
present only incomplete understood. Recent data suggest that
changes in the microenvironment, possibly altered secretion
of cytokines, might be involved. Castriconi et al showed that
transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) downregulates surface
expression of NKp30 but not NKp46 or NKp44 on NK cells36
and in vitro studies proposed cytokine stimulation by IL-15
and TGF-b11 40 as inducing factors of NKG2A expression. Ray
et al proposed upregulation of TGF-b in HCV infection and a
probable role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of HCV
related chronic liver disease.41 However, we did not find
different serum levels of TGF-b and IL-15 between the study
groups (data not shown).
Thus it remains to be resolved which other cytokines and
signalling pathways are involved in altered NKR regulation in
chronic hepatitis C.
The finding that NCR expression levels in patients who had
cleared the virus by antiviral therapy were comparable with
those observed in healthy individuals together with the fact
that a significant correlation existed between NKG2A
expression on CD8+ T cells and HCV serum levels supports
the concept that reduced expression is linked to HCV
replication or to changes in the cellular microenvironment
induced by HCV replication.
The activation status of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells
depends on the balance between activating and inhibitory
signals delivered by surface receptors. Thus our present
findings of upregulated expression of inhibitory NKG2A
receptor combined with concomitant downregulation of
activating NKp30 and NKp46 synergistically leads to the
dominant delivery of inhibitory signals to NK cells and NKR
positive T cells. This altered NKR expression is reflected by
impaired lytic function of both NK cells and CD8(+) T cells.
Therefore, dysregulation of NK cell receptor expression
provides a plausible explanation for at least one mechanism
presumably contributing to defective cellular immune func￾tions in HCV infected patients. Future experimental work is
needed to clarify if and to what extent dysregulation of NKR
expression facilitates the establishment and maintenance of
chronic hepatitis C.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Robin Spiller, Editor Chronic pancreatitis and dyspnoea
Clinical presentation
A 53 year old man was admitted with dyspnoea. Clinical
examination and chest x ray (fig 1) suggested a large right
sided pleural effusion. A spiral computed tomography scan of
the chest was performed (fig 2).
He had a previous history of long term alcohol abuse with
known chronic pancreatitis. There was no other relevant past
medical history and he was not taking any regular medica￾tions.
During his hospital stay the patient developed abdominal
pain. Laboratory investigations showed leucocytes of 12 000/
ml, C reactive protein of 27.20 mg/dl, and haemoglobin of
10.4 g/dl. Serum a-amylase was 174 U/l and lipase 128 U/l.
Question
What does the computed tomography scan of the chest
show? What is the possible explanation for this finding?
