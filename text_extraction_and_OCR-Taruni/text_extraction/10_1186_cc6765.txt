Abstract
Introduction Circulatory dysfunction in cirrhotic patients may
cause a specific kind of functional renal failure termed hepato￾renal syndrome (HRS). It contributes to the high incidence of
renal failure in cirrhotic intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Fluid
therapy may aggravate renal failure by increasing ascites and
intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). This study investigates the
short-term effects of paracentesis on haemodynamics and
kidney function in volume resuscitated patients with HRS.
Methods Nineteen consecutive cirrhotic patients with HRS
were studied. Circulatory parameters and renal function were
analysed before and after plasma expansion and paracentesis.
Haemodynamic monitoring was performed by transpulmonary
thermodilution.
Results After infusion of 200 ml of 20% human albumin
solution, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous
pressure remained unchanged. Global end-diastolic volume
index (GEDVI) increased from 791 ml m-2 (693 to 862) (median
and 25th to 75th percentile) to 844 ml m-2 (751 to 933). Cardiac
index (CI) increased from 4.1 l min-1 m-2 (3.6 to 5.0) to 4.7 l min￾1 m-2 (4.0 to 5.8), whereas systemic vascular resistance index
(SVRI) decreased from 1,422 dyn s cm-5 m-2 (1,081 to 1,772) to
1,171 dyn s cm-5 m-2 (893 to 1,705). Creatinine clearance (CC)
and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) were not affected.
During paracentesis, IAP decreased from 22 mmHg (18 to 24)
to 9 mmHg (8 to 12). MAP decreased from 81 mmHg (74 to
100) to 80 mmHg (71 to 89), and CI increased from 4.1 l min-1
m-2 (3.2 to 4.3) to 4.2 l min-1 m-2 (3.6 to 4.7), whereas SVRI
decreased from 1,639 dyn s cm-5 m-2 (1,168 to 2,037) to 1,301
dyn s cm-5 m-2 (1,124 to 1,751). CC during the 12-hour interval
after paracentesis was significantly higher than during the 12
hours before (33 ml min-1 (16 to 50) compared with 23 ml min-1
(12 to 49)). CC remained elevated for the rest of the observation
period. FeNa increased after paracentesis but returned to
baseline levels after 24 hours.
Conclusion Paracentesis with parameter-guided fluid
substitution and maintenance of central blood volume may
improve renal function and is safe in the treatment of ICU
patients with hepato-renal failure.
Introduction
According to the hypothesis of arterial vasodilation, portal
hypertension in cirrhotic patients leads to arterial vasodilation
in extra-renal vascular beds, especially in the splanchnic sys￾tem, and to the abdominal pooling of blood [1,2]. These result
in a decreased effective blood volume in the central circulation
and relative hypovolaemia. This haemodynamic dysfunction is
common in patients with cirrhosis and gives rise to the com￾pensatory stimulation of endogenous vasopressor systems
such as the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, the
CI = cardiac index; CVP = central venous pressure; CC = creatinine clearance; FG = filtration gradient; FeNa = fractional excretion of sodium; GEDVI 
= global end-diastolic volume index; HRS = hepato-renal syndrome; IAP = intra-abdominal pressure; ICU = intensive care unit; MAP = mean arterial 
pressure; RPP = renal perfusion pressure; SVRI = systemic vascular resistance index.

vasopressin system and the sympathetic nervous system.
These become increasingly strained with a narrowing capacity
to cope with additional insults such as haemorrhage, infection
or overzealous use of diuretics. Activation of systemic vaso￾pressor systems causes renal vasoconstriction that puts those
patients at risk of acute pre-renal kidney failure, which contrib￾utes substantially to the mortality risk in critically ill cirrhotic
patients [3]. Cirrhotic intensive care unit (ICU) patients with
acute renal failure (ARF) may be classified into three groups:
patients with structural kidney disease such as glomerulone￾phritis, vasculitis or acute tubular necrosis, patients with non￾specific causes of pre-renal failure, and patients with func￾tional renal failure specific to the circulatory dysfunction of cir￾rhotic patients, termed hepato-renal syndrome (HRS) [4].
Whereas the role of fluid resuscitation has been extensively
investigated in non-cirrhotic patients with sepsis-associated
circulatory failure, data on fluid resuscitation in cirrhotic
patients with this specific type of pre-renal kidney failure are
scarce. One problem with fluid expansion in cirrhotic patients
lies in the loss of infused volume to the intra-peritoneal space,
where it increases intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). The pres￾ence of ascites itself is closely related to the development of
renal failure, and 20% of cirrhotic patients with tense ascites
develop HRS. Intra-abdominal pressure may impair renal per￾fusion by decreasing the renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and
filtration gradient (FG) [5]. In addition an increase in IAP could
decrease venous return to the right ventricle or impair right￾ventricular diastolic filling, thus aggravating the hyperdynamic
circulatory dysfunction by adding a hypovolaemic or obstruc￾tive component.
Several studies focused on the prevention of post-paracente￾sis circulatory dysfunction [6-8] or on the prevention of
hepato-renal failure in patients with spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis [9]. For both indications, plasma expansion with
human albumin has become firmly established. The treatment
of HRS, once it has occurred, has been addressed by other
studies, mainly focusing on the effect of vasopressors [10,11],
but suggesting that plasma expansion with albumin may be an
important part of the treatment [12].
The present study was undertaken in cirrhotic intensive care
patients with advanced cirrhosis, tense ascites and acute
renal failure that persisted after fluid resuscitation but without
evidence of intrinsic kidney disease. The aim was to investi￾gate the single and combined haemodynamic and renal
effects of plasma expansion by infusion of albumin and of the
decrease in intra-abdominal pressure by paracentesis under
the condition of parameter-guided maintenance of central
volume.
Methods
Definitions
The – recently amended – definition of HRS has known set￾backs and is especially difficult to apply in ICU patients. The
two groups, HRS 1 and HRS 2, are delineated by criteria that
are not congruent: whereas HRS 1 is defined by an acute
increase in serum creatinine to a level above 221 μmol l-1 and
HRS 2 by a slow increase in creatinine to above 133 μmol l-1,
the classification of patients with an acute renal failure who do
not reach a serum creatinine over 221 μmol l-1 is difficult to do
adequately. Likewise, the delimitation from septic kidney fail￾ure is fuzzy. For the purpose of this study, HRS was defined as
kidney failure in cirrhotic patients who had documented normal
serum creatinine values before ICU admission and who had
suffered an acute increase in serum creatinine to values above
133 μmol l-1 within less than 14 days that persisted despite
resolution of the precipitating event and despite adequate
haemodynamic management and who showed no evidence of
intrinsic kidney disease or current infection.
Patients
Patients were included if they had persistent acute kidney fail￾ure (serum creatinine > 133 μmol l-1) with a previously normal
kidney function (serum creatinine < 98 μmol l-1), caused by an
acute condition treated in our intensive care department and if
they had a stable serum creatinine (less than 10% change per
24 hours) in the 24 hours preceding the study period. Patients
had to be haemodynamically stable without vasopressors or
positively inotropic substances for 2 days after treatment of
the condition leading to ICU admission without an improve￾ment in kidney function, and they had to fulfil the diagnostic cri￾teria established by the International Ascites Club in 1994
(Table 1) [13]. Current infection was excluded by obtaining
microbiological cultures of blood and urine and by ascitic cell
differentiation. Thrombosis of the portal vein was excluded in
each patient by duplex ultrasound. Patients were also
excluded if there was any evidence of primary kidney disease
found by screening ultrasound or biochemical and biochemi￾cal and microscopic analysis of urine or if the fractional excre￾tion of sodium (FeNa) was more than 1%, indicating other than
haemodynamic causes. None of the patients had received diu￾retics, aminoglycosides or vancomycin for at least 1 week
before inclusion, and all had received adequate volume resus￾citation during the treatment of their precipitating condition.
Catheters for invasive haemodynamic monitoring had to be in
place, and written consent was obtained from the patients or
their next of kin. Our institutional ethics committee approved
the study.
Haemodynamic measurements and measurements of 
intra-abdominal pressure
Patients were studied in a supine position, with zero pressure
at the mid-axillary line. Haemodynamic monitoring by transpul￾monary thermodilution was begun during the initial critical care

treatment. We used a commercially available system (PiCCO;
PULSION Medical Systems, Munich, Germany), which works
by the injection of a cold bolus of normal saline through a cen￾tral venous line that is detected after passing through the car￾diac chambers, pulmonary vasculature and part of the aorta by
a thermistor-tipped arterial line inserted into one of the femoral
arteries and advanced to the aortic bifurcation. The mean tran￾sit time and the slope of the temperature curve at the thermis￾tor permit the assessment of cardiac output as well as that of
the amount of intra-thoracic volume that has been passed
through and also the pulmonary blood volume. Subtracting
pulmonary blood volume from intra-thoracic blood volume pro￾vides an estimation of the largest volume of blood contained in
the four heart chambers, called, after indexing by body surface
area, the global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI). All meas￾urements were made in triplicate and averaged. They were
performed at 12-hour intervals and immediately before and
after the infusion of a fluid load and before and after
paracentesis.
Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at the beginning and
end of paracentesis by connecting the drainage tube to a
pressure transducer with the zero level set at the mid-axillary
line. Measurements were recorded after some equilibration
time and after verification of ventilatory modulation of the read￾ings, at end-expiration. RPP and renal FG were determined
from RPP = MAP - IAP and FG = MAP - (2 × IAP) [14], where
MAP is mean arterial pressure.
Assessment of kidney function
Urinary output was recorded and urine was collected over 12-
hour intervals corresponding to those of haemodynamic meas￾urements, and blood was taken at the end of each 12-hour
interval. After biochemical analysis, FeNa and creatinine clear￾ance (CC) were calculated from standard formulae.
Study protocol
Immediately after inclusion, patients received an infusion of
200 ml of 20% human albumin solution. Haemodynamic
measurements by transpulmonary thermodilution were per￾formed before and after infusion and after 12 hours. After this
first 12-hour interval, paracentesis was performed with meas￾urements of intra-abdominal pressure and haemodynamic
parameters before and after paracentesis. Thereafter, patients
received albumin solution up to a total of 8 g of albumin per
litre of ascites removed, and saline thereafter. Fluid therapy
was titrated so as to keep GEDVI and cardiac index (CI) con￾stant. Urine was collected over four 12-hour intervals for the
determination of CC and FeNa. Thereafter, paracentesis could
be repeated if clinically indicated (for example by dyspnoea or
pain) and if there had been no increase in serum creatinine
after the first intervention. Monitoring and measurements were
performed as before. Follow-up measurements of serum cre￾atinine were made 7 and 12 days after the last paracentesis
(Figure 1).
Statistical tests
We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to examine the distri￾bution of data. Because it emerged that data for most param￾eters were not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon test was
used for comparisons of paired data. To avoid false positive
results resulting from multiple testing, the level of significance
was adjusted according to Bonferroni when data from multiple
time points were compared with baseline values. P < 0.05 was
regarded as indicating significance. SPSS 11 for MAC was
used for the calculations. Correlations between haemody￾namic and renal parameters were analysed with Spearman's
non-parametric test.
Results
Nineteen consecutive patients (17 male, 2 female; age 59 ±
8.6 years (mean ± SD) were included between September
2004 and August 2005. 14 of these were listed for liver trans￾plantation. Cirrhosis was due to alcohol (n = 14), chronic hep￾atitis C (n = 2), chronic hepatitis B (n = 1) or cryptogenic (n =
2). The acute conditions leading to ICU admission were
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (n = 7), sepsis of other origin
(n = 6) and variceal haemorrhage (n = 5). One patient was
admitted because of hepatic encephalopathy, hypotension
and acute kidney failure. Patients' baseline parameters are pre￾sented in Table 2.

Immediate haemodynamic and renal effects of plasma 
expansion
The haemodynamic changes after a fluid load of 200 ml of
20% human albumin solution are presented in Table 3. Central
blood volume increased, and there was a significant decrease
in peripheral vascular resistance. MAP remained unchanged
and, consequently, there was a rise in CI. During the following
12-hour period there was no change in CC and FeNa.
Immediate haemodynamic and renal effects of 
paracentesis
Twenty-seven paracenteses were performed. One patient
received five paracenteses, in four patients two paracenteses
each were performed and one was performed in each of the
remaining 14 patients. During the procedures, 6 litres (5.3 to
8.0) of ascites were removed. IAP fell from a median of 22
mmHg to a median of 9 mmHg (Table 4). Simultaneously,
there was a significant, if small, decrease in MAP, central
venous pressure (CVP) and systemic vascular resistance
index (SVRI) and a small but consistent increase in CI. GEDVI
remained unchanged. RPP increased significantly, and the
associated increase in FG was substantial, amounting to 17
mmHg (7 to 21) (median and 25th to 75th percentile) or 34%
(13 to 64). Simultaneously, there was a significant increase in
CC and FeNa (Figures 2 and 3) during the following 12 hours.
There were correlations between the initial level of IAP and the
relative increase in CC during the 12 hours after paracentesis
(r = -0.512, P = 0.018) as well as with the relative decrease in
MAP immediately after paracentesis (r = -533, P = 0.013).
The decrease in IAP was correlated with the relative change in
SVRI after paracentesis (r = 0.586, P = 0.007).
Repeat paracenteses were performed 60 hours (48 to 72)
after the first paracentesis. IAP on repeat paracentesis was
not significantly lower than on the respective previous para￾centesis (23 mmHg (21 to 26) versus 25 mmHg (21 to 30), P
= 0.056, n = 9).

ble. Including the volume load before paracentesis, patients
received a total of 8 g (6.8 to 8.7) of albumin per litre of ascites
removed. In addition, after paracentesis there was an hourly
net fluid balance of +89 ml (61 to 101), resulting in infusion
over 48 hours of 64% of the volume removed at paracentesis.
GEDVI was kept constant despite a decrease in CVP that,
however, failed to reach the level of significance. CI and MAP
remained unchanged (Table 5).
Clinical outcome
The period of haemodynamic monitoring lasted for between
60 and 252 hours, depending on the number of paracenteses.
Overall, there was decrease of serum creatinine from 300
μmol l-1 (167 to 450) to 176 μmol l-1 (88 to 256) in all patients.
Values deteriorated in only two patients, in both after the first
paracentesis. Both received terlipressin but did not respond
and had to be dialysed. One was allotted a liver transplant and
his renal function recovered thereafter; the other developed
pneumonia and died in septic shock.
On day 7 after the last paracentesis, of the remaining 10
patients with an initial serum creatinine value of at least 221
μmol l-1, 6 had a serum creatinine of less than 221 μmol l-1, and
two had a serum creatinine value of less than 133 μmol l-1.
Four of them had a decrease in serum creatinine levels of more
than 50%. On day 12, seven had a serum creatinine value of
less than 221 μmol l-1, and three had a serum creatinine value
of less than 133 μmol l-1. In five patients, the decrease in
serum creatinine levels was larger than 50%.
Six of the seven patients with an initial serum creatinine level
of between 133 and 221 μmol l-1 had serum creatinine values
of less than 133 μmol l-1 on days 5 and 10 after the last para￾centesis; in four, serum creatinine had normalized (Figure 4).

Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that the decrease in
intra-abdominal pressure achieved by paracentesis may be rel￾evant for renal function in cirrhotic patients with renal failure
and tense ascites. A limitation of this study is the lack of a con￾trol group. Therefore a causal relationship between paracente￾sis and the improvement in renal function cannot be proved.
However, our demonstration that paracentesis did not result in
a deterioration of kidney function caused by worsening circu￾latory dysfunction, in a cohort of patients receiving fluid ther￾apy guided by transpulmonary thermodilution, may be relevant
for the management of cirrhotic ICU patients. The application
of the term HRS under the condition of ICU patients may be
problematic, because contributing factors such as septic or
post-ischaemic damage may not be strictly excluded by the
diagnostic criteria applied. But in our opinion the term HRS is
clinically useful to delineate a subset of cirrhotic patients with
acute renal failure of a predominantly functional nature, that is
in principle amenable to haemodynamic interventions.
Accordingly, recent amendments to the definition have given
up a strict delimitation of HRS from septic renal failure.
The patients in our study had persistent acute kidney failure
despite adequate fluid resuscitation according to common cri￾teria, as demonstrated by the fact that CVP and GEDVI were
in the normal range. Nevertheless, after plasma expansion with
200 ml of a 20% human albumin solution, there was a further
increase in GEDVI, indicating an increase in central blood vol￾ume, with the higher cardiac preload resulting in an increase in
CI. Whereas MAP remained virtually unchanged, there was a
substantial decrease in SVRI. This finding is in contrast with
results of other studies investigating the effects of plasma
expansion on haemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis. One
actually reported an increase in SVRI after plasma expansion
[15] and has been quoted as evidence for an indirect vasocon￾strictor effect of albumin in cirrhotic patients in a current
consensus statement on HRS [2]. In that study of patients with
SBP, however, haemodynamic measurements were 5 days
apart. In our opinion, the observed increase in SVRI was a con￾sequence of resolution of the underlying septic vasodilation
rather than an effect of the infused albumin. The authors of the
second study described pooling of the infused volume in the
mesenteric circulation in patients with advanced cirrhosis
(Child–Turcotte class C) with no significant increase in central
blood volume [16]. Still, the authors found an increase in CI
with a concomitant decrease in SVRI. We believe that the trial
may have been underpowered to detect a significant increase
in central blood volume. In fact the data show an absolute
increase of the same order of magnitude as that seen in our
patients, but the former failed to reach the level of significance
owing to the small number of patients (n = 9). The decrease in
SVRI seen in our patients after plasma expansion may have
been due to a decrease in activation of endogenous vasopres￾sor systems. Several studies have described the circulatory
dysfunction of cirrhotic patients as a primary peripheral arterial
vasodilation and mesenteric blood pooling, resulting in a low
effective arterial blood volume and compensatory stimulation
of endogenous vasopressor systems. We did not measure the
activity of vasopressor systems in our study, but decreased
levels of renin and aldosterone have been reported in patients
with Child–Pugh grade C cirrhosis after plasma expansion
[16]. Despite the increase in CI, we did not see any change in
kidney function after plasma expansion within the following 12-

hour period. The observed haemodynamic changes may there￾fore have been too small to affect renal perfusion or may have
been confined to other vascular beds. Results of a randomized
study on the treatment of HRS comparing the efficacy of
noradrenaline (norepinephrine) with that of terlipressin show
that a substantial number of the patients initially screened
responded to albumin alone if a CVP of between 10 and 15
cmH2O was obtained [12]. This compares to baseline values
of 11 mmHg (14 cmH2O) in our patients, possibly indicating a
larger central blood volume. However, CVP has been found to
be unreliable as an indicator of preload and may be even less
accurate in conditions with elevated intra-abdominal pressure
[17-19]. The 15% increase in CI seen in our patients after a
fluid load of 200 ml of human albumin solution shows that
these patients were volume responsive despite their normal
CVP. Larger doses of human albumin might thus have had
more pronounced effects on renal perfusion.
Intra-abdominal hypertension was present in all patients, and
paracentesis resulted in a substantial decrease in intra￾abdominal pressure. Because the concomitant decrease in
MAP was small, this resulted in a major increase in APP and

FG. Simultaneously, CI increased while CVP and SVRI were
reduced. This is in keeping with the results of previous studies
assessing the effect of paracentesis on systemic haemody￾namics [20-22]. These cardiocirculatory changes have been
attributed to improved cardiac filling and an increased venous
return after paracentesis. However, GEDVI, as a marker of
preload, remained constant in our study, whereas CVP also
decreased, arguing against a major contribution of increased
cardiac preload to the rising CI. As MAP also decreased
slightly, we believe it more likely that a decrease in afterload,
as demonstrated by the falling SVRI, was the reason for the
enhanced CI. This decrease in vascular resistance might have
been the result of several factors. On the one hand, worsening
circulatory dysfunction has been described after paracentesis
[23]. On the other hand, release of IAP may increase splanch￾nic blood flow at lower pressures [22]. A reduction of IAP may
also improve renal perfusion by lowering venous and retroperi￾toneal pressure. The observation, made by others, of decreas￾ing serum renin levels after large-volume paracentesis
supports the importance of this effect, because renin secre￾tion is controlled by transmural arteriolar pressure [24] and
hypoperfusion at the macula densa [25], both probably influ￾enced by changes in intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal pres￾sure. The increasing FeNa and CC seen in our patients adds
further evidence to this concept and shows that the net result
of immediate circulatory changes after paracentesis may be
beneficial for renal function.
The elevation of CC seen already during the first 12 hours after
paracentesis was maintained over 48 hours while central
blood volume, as indicated by GEDVI, was kept constant. The
improved serum creatinine values seen at 7 and 12 days after
the last paracentesis also indicate that renal function remained
above baseline in most of the patients. As has previously been
shown, post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction is most pro￾nounced after 6 days [8]. Its detrimental effect on kidney func￾tion can be prevented by plasma expansion with albumin [8].
Our results suggest that elevated IAP may be a contributing
factor in the development of renal failure in cirrhotic patients
with tense ascites and that paracentesis may have a role in the
treatment of HRS as long as central blood volume is main￾tained. The cause of the falling SVRI seen after paracentesis
is controversial. On the basis of our findings we propose that
increasing splanchnic and renal blood flow and decreased
activation of endogenous vasopressor systems are important
effects of paracentesis and that the decreased vascular tone
may reflect not a deterioration of circulatory dysfunction but
less demand for vasoconstrictor activation in the face of
improving abdominal and renal perfusion pressures. The con￾comitant increase in splanchnic blood volume would further
underline the importance of maintaining adequate preload,
and post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction could be
regarded mainly as representing relative hypovolaemia caused
by fluid losses into the intra-peritoneal compartment.
Conclusion
This study indicates that the expansion of central blood volume
is possible even in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The ensu￾ing circulatory changes are small, however, and renal effects
were not visible with the amount of albumin solution used in
our study. After paracentesis there was a marked decrease in
IAP and RPP. Under substitution of albumin and fluids to
maintain central blood volume, there was a simultaneous
improvement of renal function that may be relevant in patients
with end-stage liver disease.

Key messages
• Cardiac index in cirrhotic patients with hepato-renal 
syndrome may be fluid-responsive despite normal cen￾tral venous pressure and global end-diastolic volume.
• Intra-abdominal hypertension, caused by ascites, can 
be reduced by paracentesis, resulting in a net increase 
in renal perfusion pressure.
• After paracentesis, fluid substitution can be titrated to 
keep global end-diastolic volume constant, and creati￾nine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium may 
increase.
• In cirrhotic intensive care patients with intra-abdominal 
hypertension caused by ascites resulting from fluid ther￾apy, paracentesis is a safe procedure.
