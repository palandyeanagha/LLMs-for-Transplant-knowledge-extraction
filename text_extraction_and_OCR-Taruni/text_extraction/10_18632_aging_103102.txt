INTRODUCTION
By late 2019 the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) was unchecked in China [1, 2]. Apart from 
supportive care, specific drugs for this disease are still 
being researched [3, 4]. The absence of efficacy-proven 
antiviral treatment has led to attempts to treat severe 
SARS-CoV-2 infection with convalescent plasma 
containing SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies from 
recovery patients-a precedent established with 
pathogen-specific immunoglobulin therapy for Ebola 
virus disease, influenza, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, and severe fever and thrombocytopenia 
syndrome [5–8].

ABSTRACT
Background: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus antibody levels in convalescent plasma (CP), which may be useful in severe
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, have been rarely reported.
Results: A total of eight donors were considered for enrollment; two of them were excluded because of
ineligible routine check. Of the six remaining participants, five samples were tested weakly positive by the IgM
ELISA. Meanwhile, high titers of IgG were observed in five samples. The patient treated with CP did not require
mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion, and was then transferred to a general ward.
Conclusions: Our serological findings in convalescent plasma from recovered patients may help facilitate
understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish CP donor screening protocol in COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies including IgM and IgG were measured by two enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in convalescent plasma from six donors who have recovered from coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nanjing, China. CP was also utilized for the treatment of one severe COVID-19
patient.

Previous reports on other viral infections have 
suggested that convalescent plasma with higher 
antibody levels may have great effect on virus load
[9, 10], and our study was designed to test anti-SARS￾CoV-2 virus antibody levels to select those with high 
titers, desiring a meaningful serologic response after 
CP infusion.
In accordance with CP infusion therapeutics guidelines 
approved by the National Health Commission of 
People's Republic of China, we used ELISA to screen 
for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. In this report, we 
present our preliminary findings of anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibody levels in convalescent plasma obtained from 
six donors and clinical effects of one case treated with 
CP in Nanjing, China.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the six CP donors
We recruited a total of six donors including four males 
and two females, aged from 30 to 50 years old, with 
laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 
COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent recovery 
certificated by two consecutively negative SARS-CoV￾2 PCR assays and resolution of clinical symptoms. All 
the donors had fever and cough during the course of 
COVID-19. None of the donors were currently 
smoking. Donor D had a history of brain surgery due 
to a benign tumor. The other five donors did not have 
any underlying comorbidities. The baseline blood 
examinations of the donors, when they were admitted 
to the hospital due to COVID-19, were summarized in 
Table 1. At the time of admission, two donors had 
lymphocytopenia (lymphocyte counts<0.8×109
/L), one
donor had increased alanine aminotransferase level (144 
IU/L), one donor had elevated creatine kinase level (490 
U/L), three donors had abnormal lactate dehydrogenase 
(ranged from 261 to 286 IU/L) and four donors had a C￾reactive protein level of more than 10 mg/L (Table 1). 
Chest CT scans demonstrated bilateral pneumonia in all 
six donors. 
During hospitalization, all donors were routinely given 
antiviral therapy with interferon-α (500 WU, twice a 
day, aerosol inhalation) and lopinavir/ritonavir 
(400/100mg, twice a day). Donor B, C, D, and E also 
received intravenous immunoglobulin. A 3-day course 
of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg per day) 
was administered to donor B, D and F. None of donor 
needed mechanical ventilation or required to be 
transferred to the intensive care unit. The time from 
onset of symptoms to clearance of virus, defined as two 
consecutive negative nucleic acid tests from throat swab 
samples, were varied from 8 to 18 days. The donors 
were discharged after virus clearance and substantially 
improvement of their pneumonia.
Plasma samples were collected at times ranging from 29 
to 46 days after symptom onset, and 13 to 27 days after 
their discharge, respectively (Table 2). At the time of 
blood donation, the donors were free of any symptom. 
The complete blood count, liver and renal function, 
lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were 
within the normal range. The lymphocyte subsets counts 
were summarized in Table 3. All ABO types were 
involved in the study except AB type. Additionally, as 
part of the routine check, the donated plasma was 
confirmed free of hepatitis B and C virus, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and residual SARS￾CoV-2 by RT-PCR and serologic negative for hepatitis 
B and C virus, HIV, and syphilis.
Serological findings of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 
detected by ELISA 
The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody was weakly 
reactive (OD ratio from 1.22 to 2.01) for all donors 
except donor F, with a slightly higher OD ratio of 5.63, 
and IgG ELISA assay were also positive (OD ratio from 
3.92 to 8.36) for all six donors who had IgM reactive 
plasma samples (Table 2). 
All donors but one had high IgG titers (≥1:320) (Figure 1),
meeting the criteria (≥1:160) sponsored by the National 
Health Commission. However, donor D had a low IgG 
titer (1:40) (Figure 1), therefore this donor was not 
considered as an eligible donor. This donor, a 42-year￾old man had the longest duration (46 days) from 
symptom onset to plasma collection and he had the 
longest duration (19 days) of hospital stay. Also, this 
donor had the lowest CD19+ B-cell count as well as 
percentage in the lymphocyte subsets analysis (Table 3).
Clinical utility of CP in a critically ill patient
The recipient for CP was a 64-year-old female. The 
patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever, 
fatigue, nausea and vomiting for 3 days, and was then 
confirmed of COVID-19. The underlying commodities 
included hypertension and diabetes. There was a fast 
progression of the clinical condition. On day 4 of 
hospitalization, the patient was transferred to Intensive 
Care Unit (ICU) and 1 week later received invasive 
mechanical ventilation. SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable 
from throat swab sample by nucleic acid test at the time 
of intubation. On day 17 of hospitalization, while the 
patient was still receiving invasive mechanical 
ventilation with a PaO2/FiO2 of 166 mmHg, she was 
given 200 mL CP from donor B. At the time of plasma 
transfusion, the lymphocyte count was 0.44×109
/L.

and was then transferred to a general ward.
DISCUSSION
We reported the serological findings of SARS-CoV-2 
infection in a CP donor population. Our preliminary 
findings suggest that recently recovered COVID-19 
patients may be suitable potential donors, provided they 
meet other blood donation criteria. 
Although our experience is limited in a few cases, a 
possibility could be suggested that, different from other 
viruses like MERS-CoV infection [11], antibody to 
SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma was frequently 
reactive by ELISA. All of the six donors showed 
positive IgM results, indicating that a negative result for 
IgM, a serologic marker which usually represents a 
recent or current infection [12–14], may not be suitable 
to be taken as a mandatory requirement for CP donor 
selection of limited availability of eligible potential 
donors in a COVID-19 outbreak. Of the six donors, 
only one donor had IgG titers of 1:40, which did not 
meet the criteria 1:160 recommended by the National 
Health Commission. Of note, compared with other 
donors, he experienced a severe disease, and had the 
longest duration from symptom onset to plasma 
collection, we suspected whether this phenomenon was 
related to his low CD19+ B-cell count or he had 
experienced a viral reactivation-an observation that 
requires further investigation. 
However, due to limitations imposed by sample size, 
reactivity of ELISA tests may also be affected by the 
timing of plasma collection, severity of illness or 
corticosteroids administration. In addition, although this 
life-threatening disease appear to be under control 
following nationwide efforts and implementation of 
quarantine policy in China, but it is still developing in the 
other parts of the world. As yet no reference materials of 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been made available to 
evaluate the performance of the kits. Our study highlights 
the need for prospective serology studies and good 
laboratory quality assurance to better understand the 
humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The weakness of the study should be noted that the 
clinical relevance of antibody titers in protecting against 
subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection is uncertain. 
Compared to ELISAs, neutralization assays require virus 
culture, are much more labor-intensive, and need to be 
conducted in laboratories with higher biosafety levels
[15, 16]. We are currently conducting neutralization 
studies to further investigate whether ELISA results 
were correlated with neutralization results so far as to 
substitute for the neutralization test in resource-limited 
situations.
Although a favorable outcome was achieved in one
patient after CP transfusion, the efficacy of CP remains 
inconclusive due to the very small sample size and other 
concomitant treatments, which might confound the 
result.
In summary, we presented serologic findings from six 
CP donors recovered from COVID-19 and one case 
treated with CP. This report may help facilitate 
understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
establish donor screening protocol for CP infusion 
therapeutics in the COVID-19 outbreak.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Under the first and second edition of CP infusion 
therapeutics guidelines approved by the National 

www.aging-us.com 6540 AGING
Health Commission, we developed a protocol for 
donor screening, plasma collection and specimen 
analysis to screen potential donors and collect high￾titer plasma. Donor screening, specimen collecting and 
convalescent plasma collecting were conducted at the 
Second Hospital of Nanjing, a designated medical 
institution for COVID-19. The antibody testing was 
conducted in Nanjing Red Cross Blood Center, and its 
Department of Laboratory Medicine is accredited by 
China National Accreditation Service for Conformity 
Assessment. This study was approved by the ethics 
committee of the Second Hospital of Nanjing 
(reference number: 2020-LS-ky003). Written informed 
consent was obtained from all the donors and the 
recipient.
Donor population
We screened potential convalescent plasma donors 
from patients who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection by PCR and had recovered at least four 
weeks from symptom onset. A total of eight volunteers 
were recruited as potential plasma donors for 
assessment. Two were excluded because of elevated 
alanine transaminase for one case and unexpected 
hemoglobin levels for the other case. The remaining 
six provided written, informed consent to become 
qualified donors.
Collection of specimens for antibody levels
Convalescent plasma was collected by apheresis from 
COVID-19 recovered donors, and specimen for 
antibody testing were collected from an integrated 
bypass collection reserved sample bag. Plasma for 
determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels 
was collected in EDTA tubes and serum for anti-SARS￾CoV-2 IgM antibody levels was collected in tubes with 
coagulation accelerators. Samples were delivered to 
Nanjing Red Cross Blood Center immediately after 
collecting, followed by sample centrifuging and 
antibody testing. 
Serology tests 
Two solid-phase microplate ELISAs were employed, 
based on the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 
(Livzon, Diagnostics Inc., Zhuhai, China). 
The first kit was a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay for IgM antibody using horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP)-labeled SARS-CoV-2 antigens. To reveal IgM, 
serum samples were diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer and 
allowed to incubate for 60 min with plates coated by 
anti-human IgM μ chain. Plates were washed and HRP￾labeled antigens were added. After 30 min incubation, 
unbound components were washed away, following 
adding of TMB substrate with its buffer. For a further 
15 min incubation, stop buffer was added and 
absorbance values were measured at 450nm and 630nm 
dual-wavelength using a microplate reader.
The second kit was an indirect enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay designed for IgG antibody. After 
a formulated 1:20 predilution according to the ELISA 
manufacturer’s instructions, plasma specimens were 
serially titrated 1:1, 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160 and 
1:320 in microplates by plasma from unexposed donors 
and added to plates coated with SARS-CoV-2 antigens. 
Following 60 min incubation at 37°C, plates were 
washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase￾labeled anti-human IgG secondary antibody. Again, 
plates were washed following 30 min incubation at 
37°C and TMB substrate was added with its buffer.
15 min later, stop buffer was added and absorbance 
values were measured at 450nm and 630nm dual￾wavelength using a microplate reader.
Results were reported as the optical density (OD) ratio, 
which was calculated as the OD value of the donor’s 
sample divided by the cutoff OD value. We used cutoff 
values recommended by the ELISA kit manufacturer: 
a ratio of <1 was considered negative, and ≥1 was 
considered positive.
Statistical methods
All data from measurements were displayed as tables
and a histogram.
