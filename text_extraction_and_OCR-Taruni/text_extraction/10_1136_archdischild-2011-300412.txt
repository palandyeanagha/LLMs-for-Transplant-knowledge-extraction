ABSTRACT
Objective The purpose of the study was to investigate 
the trends and causes of regional disparities of infant 
mortality rate (IMR) in rural China from 1996 to 2008.
Design A population-based, longitudinal study.
Setting The national child mortality surveillance 
network.
Population Population of the 79 surveillance counties.
Main outcome measure IMR, leading causes of infant 
death and the RR of IMR.
Results The IMR in coastal, inland and remote regions 
declined by 72.4%, 62.9% and 58.2%, respectively, from 
1996 to 2008. Compared with the coastal region, the RR 
of IMR were 1.7 (95% CI 1.6 to 1.9), 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 
2.0) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0) for inland region and 2.6 
(95% CI 2.4 to 2.7), 3.2 (95% CI 3.0 to 3.5) and 3.1 (95% 
CI 2.7 to 3.4) for the remote region during 1996–2000, 
2001–2005 and 2006–2008, respectively. The regional 
disparities existed for both male and female IMRs. The 
postneonatal mortality showed the highest regional 
disparities. Pneumonia, birth asphyxia, prematurity/
low birth weight, injuries and diarrhoea were the main 
contributors to the regional disparities. There were 
signifi cantly more infants who did not seek healthcare 
services before death in the remote region relative to 
the inland and coastal regions.
Conclusion The results indicated persistent existence 
of regional disparities in IMR in rural China. It is worth 
noting that regional disparities in IMR increased in the 
remote and coastal regions during 2001–2005 in rural 
China. These disparities remained unchanged during 
2006–2008. The results indicate that strategies to 
reduce mortality caused by pneumonia, birth asphyxia 
and diarrhoea are keys to reducing IMR.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, the survival, health 
and development of children have aroused global 
concern. Child health disparities have become a 
considerable problem in global public health. The 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aim to 
reduce inequality between countries and within 
countries.1 Reducing infant mortality and narrow￾ing the child health disparity gap are the national 
goals of many countries, including China.2 3
Infant mortality rate (IMR) is a common indi￾cator for measuring the standard of child health.4
Health condition of Chinese children has remark￾ably improved. Between 1991 and 2008, IMR 
fell from 51.2 to 14.9 per 1000 live births.5 This 
mortality is lower than a majority of the devel￾oping countries.6 However, geographical varia￾tions in IMR have always been a challenge for 
Chinese government because of the geographical 
divergence and imbalanced economical develop￾ment. This regional variation is more substantial 
between the poorly developed remote rural west￾ern regions and the well-developed rural coastal 
regions.7 However, there have been no publica￾tions regarding the trends and causes of IMR 
between the two regions in China. There also 
have been no reports regarding IMR variations in 
rural China since 2004. In this study, we carried 
out a nationwide analysis with data from 1996 
to 2008 in rural China. The specifi c aim of this 
study was to investigate the trends and causes of 
the geographical disparities of IMR in rural China 
in order to guide policies aimed at prevention of 
issues contributing to a high IMR.
METHODS
Data source
The data for this study was based on the national 
children mortality surveillance network. The 
network monitors a population of 13 million that 
covers 116 representative districts/counties across 
31 provinces using stratifi ed sampling strategies. 
Details on data collection in the surveillance 
network have been published previously.8 9 Each

What is already known on this subject
▶ Infant mortality rate (IMR) is a common 
indicator of the level of child health.
▶ The health condition of Chinese children has 
remarkably improved between 1991 and 
2008.
▶ The regional disparities of IMR were 
substantial in China between the poorly 
developed remote rural regions and the 
well-developed coastal rural regions before 
2004.
What this papers adds
▶ The regional disparity of IMR increased 
between the remote and coastal regions in 
2001–2005. However, the increasing trend 
was not observed in 2006–2008.
▶ Pneumonia, birth asphyxia and diarrhoea 
were the three main contributors of the 
regional disparities.
▶ The healthcare accessibility is signifi cantly 
lower in the western remote region relative 
to the other two regions.

Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Hainan, 
Shaanxi, eastern Sichuan and Chongqing. The remote region 
includes inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet, Gansu, 
Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang and western Sichuan. Based on 
the economic conditions, Sichuan Province was divided into 
eastern Sichuan and western Sichuan which were assigned to 
the inland and remote region, respectively (fi gure 1).
Among the 116 representative districts/counties, 79 were in 
rural areas. Of those in the rural areas, 19 were in the coastal 
region, 38 in the inland region and 22 in the remote region. All 
the data used in this study were from the rural regions.
Statistical analysis
The IMR was calculated as the number of deaths within one 
year of birth per 1000 live births. IMR was further broken down 
into early neonate mortality rate (ENMR) (0–6 days of birth), 
late neonate mortality rate (LNMR) (7–27 days of birth) and 
post-neonate mortality rate (PNMR) (28–364 days of birth).
Premortality healthcare services were categorised into inpa￾tient, outpatient and untreated groups based on the health￾care encountered 24 h before death. Healthcare services that 
the infants received 24 h before the death were divided into 
fi ve levels based on the Chinese healthcare system. They are 
provincial/municipal hospital, county/district hospital, town￾ship/neighbourhood hospital, village doctor and no healthcare 
seeking. For this study, the hospital at the highest level was 
recorded as the level of hospital visited before death if two 
or more hospitals had been visited. Accessibility to healthcare 
was indicated by premortality treatment, the proportion of 
each category of hospitals visited and the proportion of infants 
not seeking healthcare. Injury-related death is not included due 
to the low hospital visiting rate after incidence of injury.
We artifi cially assigned the whole observational period from 
1996 to 2008 into three periods (1996–2000, 2001–2005 and 
2006–2008) for statistical purposes because the annual num￾ber of deaths was too low to precisely calculate the mortality.
child death was investigated and reported by doctors and then 
reviewed by the county-level women and child healthcare 
institute and the county general hospitals to ensure data accu￾racy. In addition, quality control of data collection was rou￾tinely conducted at all levels of the surveillance network. The 
causes of death were classifi ed according to the International 
Classifi cation of Diseases-10 (ICD-10).10
Regional categories
The 31 provinces were divided into coastal, inland and remote 
regions based on geographical locations and economic condi￾tions. The coastal region includes Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, 
Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong and Guangdong. 
The inland region includes Hebei, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin,

(p<0.01), with a signifi cantly less decline in the remote region 
(fi gure 2). The ENMR was the highest, followed by PNMR 
and then LNMR. Compared with the coastal region, the RR 
of ENMR, LNMR and IMR increased from 2.0 (95% CI 1.8 to 
2.2), 2.4 (95% CI 2.1 to 2.9) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.4 to 2.7), respec￾tively, during 1996–2000 to 2.8 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.1), 3.6 (95% 
CI 2.9 to 4.5) and 3.2 (95% CI 3.0 to 3.5) during 2001–2005 
in the remote region (p<0.01) . These rates stayed fl at during 
the 2006–2008. The RR of the abovementioned mortalities 
were not changed when comparing the inland region with the 
coastal region during 1996–2008 (p>0.05) (table 1).
As of the gender impact on IMR, fi rst we examined the 
regional difference in each gender. Both genders had higher 
IMRs in the inland and remote regions than in the coastal 
region. Then next, we examined the IMR difference between 
the two genders. The RRs presented here were the IMR of male 
infants relative to the female infants. The RRs were greater 
SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Carey, North Carolina, USA) was 
used for the data statistical analysis. Cases that had missing 
information in the categories analysed were excluded for sta￾tistical analysis, but were included in other categories that 
had complete information. The Cochran-Armitage test was 
conducted to calculate the IMR and the causes-specifi c IMR 
over time within each region. The Woolf method was used 
to calculate the RR and 95% CI between different regions. 
Consistency for RR of the mortality or cause-specifi c IMR 
between regions during the three time periods was tested by 
Woolf’s Consistency Test. If the RR were inconsistent between 
different periods, the interaction exists between region and 
time periods.11 12
RESULTS
From 1996 to 2008, the reduction of IMR in the coastal, inland 
and remote regions were 72.4%, 62.9% and 58.2%, respectively

There was a steady increase in inpatient care throughout 
the three regions. A persistent decrease of infants who did not 
seek healthcare service was also seen, with the greater propor￾tion of infants who did not visit doctors in the remote region 
(25%) relative to the coastal region (5%) (p<0.01) (table 4).
Reasons behind the lack of healthcare-seeking behaviour 
before infant death were explored. We analysed data from 
2003 to 2008 because the network only collected information 
regarding this matter during this time period. The time period 
was divided into 2003–2005 and 2006–2008 for statistical pur￾poses. In the coastal region, the main reasons for no healthcare 
seeking were delayed hospital visits and others (parents gave up 
treatment due to severe congenital anomalies of infants) during 
these two time periods. For the inland and remote region, the 
main reasons included delayed hospital visits, lack of knowl￾edge of the severity of the diseases among the parents, religious 
or ethnic beliefs and fi nancial diffi culties. In the remote region, 
the cases of infant death due to the parent’s lack of knowledge 
were signifi cantly higher during 2006–2008 than 2003–2005. 
Other main reasons also included fi nancial diffi culties (11%) 
and transportation issues (9%) in the remote region (fi gure 3). 
There were some missing data in this study. But the bias can be 
ignored since only less than 0.5% data were missing.
DISCUSSION
In rural China, the regional disparities of ENMR, LNMR, 
PNMR and IMR are still an issue although IMRs are remark￾ably declined. Disparities in PNMR were higher than ENMR 
and LNMR. Regional disparities in IMR exist in both genders. 
Between the remote and the coastal regions, disparities in IMR 
were signifi cantly higher during 2001–2005 and remained 
fl at during 2006–2008. Liu et al reported that the IMR was 
than 1 during periods 1996–2000 and 2006–2008, with the 
exception of period 2001–2005. The 95% CI of RR were 0.9 to 
1.3, 1.0 to 1.3 and 0.9 to 1.1 during 2006–2008 in the coastal, 
inland and remote regions, respectively (table 2).
The main diseases that caused infant deaths were pneu￾monia, birth asphyxia, prematurity/low birth weight (LBW), 
diarrhoea, injuries and congenital anomalies, which accounted 
for 80% of the total infant deaths. Most of the cause-specifi c 
mortalities declined within each region (p<0.01) with the 
exception that there were no signifi cant changes for diarrhoea￾caused IMR in the coastal region and congenital anomaly￾caused IMR in the remote region (table 3).
Compared with the coastal region, the inland and remote 
regions had higher IMRs resulted from pneumonia, birth 
asphyxia, prematurity/LBW, injuries and diarrhoea during the 
entire study time period with the exception of the diarrhoea￾caused IMR in inland region during 2006–2008. Compared 
with the coastal region, the RR of IMRs caused by pneumonia, 
birth asphyxia, prematurity/LBW, diarrhoea and congenital 
anomalies increased during 2001–2005 for the remote regions 
(p<0.05). There was no signifi cant change during 2006–2008. 
The RR of the abovementioned cause-specifi c IMR, except 
congenital anomalies between inland and coastal region, had 
no signifi cant change during the three time periods (p>0.05) 
(table 3).
A high accessibility was considered when the infants visited 
the provincial/municipal or county/district hospitals before 
death. Individuals seeking treatment at hospitals in these two 
levels signifi cantly increased throughout all three regions. 
However, during 2006–2008, the percentage of individuals going 
to higher-levelled hospitals was signifi cantly lower in the remote 
region (56%) relative to the coastal region (84%) (table 4).

signifi cantly higher in six provinces in the western region rela￾tive to the four provinces in the coastal region and two inland 
provinces from 1990 to 2000.7 Our results showed a similar 
trend, but on a much larger scale and over a longer time period. 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the regional dis￾parities in IMR in China are not improved. Disparities in chil￾dren’s health have not been signifi cantly reduced in developed 
or underdeveloped countries. The disparities in children’s 
health challenge the Chinese government and a majority of 
the countries globally.13–19
Our fi ndings showed that more than 60% of infant deaths 
happened during the neonatal period and more than 75% of 
neonatal deaths happened during the early neonatal period. Our 
results are similar to reports published by a number of other 
countries.20 Tomashek et al reported that the neonatal mortality 
rate (NMR) among American Caucasian was counted for 62.0% 
of the IMR.21 During the past two decades, the NMR has been 
declining very slowly in a majority of countries. To achieve the 
MDGs and reduce the mortality of children and infants, the 
United Nations’ Children’s Fund stresses strategies that effi -
ciently reduce NMRs.22 Our results indicate that the PNMR 
had the highest regional disparities. This is similar to what the 
reports by Bladwin showed that the adjusted OR for PNMR 
between American Indians and Alaska natives and rural Whites 
was higher than that for NMR between them (1.46 vs 0.85).23
During 2006 to 2008, the 95% CI of RR of male IMR versus 
female IMR in the coastal and inland regions were 0.9 to 1.3 
and 1.0 to 1.3, respectively. Considering that the range of this 
RR between 1.2 and 1.3 was commonly accepted as a standard 
by a number of studies,24 our data suggested that there was no 
signifi cant IMR difference between genders in the coastal and 
inland regions. The remote region had relative higher IMR in 
female than male infants, which was similar to the reports 
from east Asia and South Asia.25
The reason of variations in IMR, although not clear, may 
be complex and synergistic. It can be attributed to multiple 
factors such as socioeconomic circumstances, healthcare 
accessibility and fertility rate.26–30 The socioeconomic factor 
is probably one of the major contributors to the inequality in 
infant mortality in rural China. First, although the Chinese 
economy has been rapidly growing in the past 10 years, 
the gap of gross domestic product per person between the 
coastal and remote western regions in 2008 was increasing 
when compared with 2000.31 The imbalanced rapid economy 
growth may have contributed to the unchanged RR of IMR 
between 2001–2005 and 2006–2008 for the remote region 
relative to the coastal region. Secondly, among the 592 poor￾est counties, 366 were in the remote regions where 66% of the 
population was in poverty.32 Third, 10.7% of the infant death 
in the untreated group in the remote region in our study was 
due to fi nancial diffi culties.
Our results indicated that lack of accessibility to health ser￾vices and lack of knowledge of care-seeking/warning signs 
among parents may be the main impact to the regional dispari￾ties of IMR. Healthcare accessibility is negatively correlated 
with infant mortality (Shi et al).27 Limited healthcare resources 
could be one of the major contributors to the limited accessibil￾ity of healthcare. A national healthcare survey in 2008 showed 
that the number of healthcare workers in township hospitals 
and village clinics was 1.37 and 1.22 per 1000 rural popula￾tions in the coastal region, while 0.95 and 0.91 in the remote 
region, respectively.33 In this study, the signifi cantly lower 
number of visits to provincial/municipal and county/district 
hospital before infant death in the remote region relative to 
the other two regions further supports the importance of the 
healthcare accessibility. The analysis on the reasons for dead 
infants without treatment before death during 2006–2008 
indicated that 39% were caused by unawareness of the sever￾ity of the disease among parents and 26% by delayed hospital

visiting. Both of the two main reasons may suggest a relative 
lower education level of the parents.
IMR is positively correlated with total fertility rate.21 The 
total fertility rate dropped from 2.9 in 1979, when the one￾child policy started, to 1.7 in 2004.34 35 The one-child policy 
actually allows two children per family if you are a minority. 
These individuals mostly live in the remote region of China 
(73.15% in 1990). The average fertility rate is 2.0–2.5 in the 
remote region, while the rate is more than 3.0 for over 50% of 
the minorities.36–38 This indirectly supported the relationship 
of fertility rate to IMR.
Pneumonia, birth asphyxia, prematurity/LBW, injuries and 
diarrhoea were the main diseases that caused an increased RR 
in IMR in the remote region compared with the coastal region. 
This indicates that certain procedures are able to facilitate the 
improvement of regional disparities in infant mortality such 
as resuscitation training to decrease birth-asphyxia-related 
mortality.39 40
The limitations of our study included the following: (1) we 
did not have data related to household income and maternal 
education and age, which prevented us from researching the 
direct relationship between these factors and IMR. (2) We did 
not have data of healthcare service for the whole population. 
Our analysis was based on the healthcare provided to the 
infants before death. Therefore, our results about the health￾care accessibility were biased.
To summarise, this study indicated remarkable declines in 
IMR in rural China in the past 13 years with the preservation of 
regional variations. It is worth noting that regional disparities 
in IMR increased between the remote and coastal regions in 
2001–2005. However, the increasing trend was not observed in 
2006–2008. Pneumonia, birth asphyxia and diarrhoea were the 
three main contributors to the regional disparities. This data 
may provide a basic information and may help direct Chinese 
government to reduce the geographical disparities by increas￾ing healthcare accessibility, by formulating related policies and 
by enhancing doctor training on neonate resuscitation.
