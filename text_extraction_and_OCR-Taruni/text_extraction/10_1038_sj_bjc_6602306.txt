The occurrence of second primary cancers was explored in patients with squamous cell cancer of the skin (SCC). The excess
incidence subsequent to SCC was mainly in cancers related to sunlight and smoking, and in lymphoproliferative malignancies, it was
largest (10-fold) in salivary gland cancer.

Malignant tumours of the skin are common cancers, typically
affecting fair skinned racial groups (Armstrong and Kricker, 2001).
The UV component of sunlight is regarded as the most important
factor leading to squamous cell cancer (SCC). Other dominant risk
factors are smoking and immunosuppression. A number of studies
have found significantly increased risks of various second primary
cancers in SCC patients (Frisch and Melbye, 1995; Levi et al, 1997;
Wassberg et al, 1999; Askling et al, 1999; Hemminki and Dong,
2000; Hemminki et al, 2001; Efird et al, 2002). Some general
patterns can be seen from these studies. There is an increased risk
for the development of subsequent skin cancers, cancers of the lip,
lungs, pharynx, larynx, the salivary glands and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma.
We have examined the occurrence of primary cancer subsequent
to the development of SCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Information on patients diagnosed with SCC and subsequent
primary cancers was obtained from the Thames Cancer Registry
(TCR). The TCR records data on the occurrence of cancer in the 14
million population of Southeast England.
Patients diagnosed with a primary SCC between 1 January 1961
and 31 December 2000 were extracted from the database. This
numbered 25 731 cases (16 962 men and 8769 women). The
classification of a second primary tumour excludes cases of
metastasis or reoccurrence of the initial malignancy. The
standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for the development of each
second primary cancer was calculated by dividing the observed
number by the expected number, obtained from age and sex￾specific cancer incidence rates for the area. For a given subsequent
cancer site, person-years at risk were calculated from the date of
diagnosis of SCC to the date of first diagnosis of cancer at the
specified site or to the exit date (date of death, loss to follow-up or
85th birthday, whichever was earlier). Patients diagnosed prior to 1
January 1971 were followed up actively, obtaining death informa￾tion, until 31 December 1982. These were censored at this date.
Patients diagnosed after 1 January 1971 were followed up through
the NHS Central Registry, which provides notification of all deaths
routinely to the TCR. Byar’s method was used for the calculation of
95% confidence intervals for the SIR values.
RESULTS
There were 3359 cases of second primary cancers after SCC
diagnosis, of which 2567 were in male patients and 792 were in
female patients (Table 1). The SIR for the occurrence of any second
primary cancer was 1.2 in both male and female subjects.
There was an increased risk for non melanoma skin cancer (BCC
was not included). Risk for malignant melanoma was significantly
increased in both male and female subjects (SIR male 3.0; female
2.9). Lip cancer risk was greatly elevated (SIR male 3.5; female 7.7).
Relative risk of cancer of the pharynx was elevated, and
statistically significantly so in female subjects. Risk of oesophagus
cancer was increased in males, and colon cancer incidence was
increased in both sexes. Salivary gland cancer risk was particularly
elevated (SIR male 11.0; female 10.6).
The respiratory system in general was at an increased
susceptibility to second primary cancers. Lung cancer occurrence
was especially striking, not only due to the increased SIR values in
both sexes (SIR male 1.3; female 1.2), but also because of the large
absolute excess incidence. Lung cancer accounted for 24% of the
total second primary cancer occurrence, and 28% of the excess
burden of cancer in the cohort. The nasal cavity (and ear) was at a
significantly increased risk in female subjects and laryngeal cancer
displayed a significantly increased risk in male subjects.
There was an evident increase in occurrence of lymphoma and
leukaemia. Hodgkin’s disease had a raised SIR value (1.4) in males
only. However, non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (comprising follicular,

diffuse and other varieties) showed consistently elevated SIR values
in both sexes. A significantly increased risk of development of
lymphoid leukaemia was also observed (SIR male 1.7; female 1.8).
Generally, the risk of second cancer was highest within the first
year following SCC diagnosis. The cancers with the highest and most
sustained SIRs were lip cancer (in males), salivary gland cancer,
malignant melanoma of the skin, laryngeal cancer (in males), non￾Hodgkin’s lymphoma (diffuse and other varieties excluding
follicular) and lymphoid leukaemia. However, salivary gland cancer
had the greatest SIR values and sustained risk with time: even after
10 years, a high relative risk was still present; SIR 15.3 (7.29 –32.1)
before 1 year and SIR 4.7 (1.18–18.8) after 10 years.
DISCUSSION
This study confirms that there is a significantly increased relative
risk of second primary cancers in individuals with SCC. The UV
component of sunlight is widely believed to be the main risk factor
for skin and lip cancer and this may explain the subsequent excess
of malignant melanomas and SCCs of the lip.
It has been observed previously that the southern US (with
higher exposure to UV radiation) has a significantly higher
incidence of salivary gland cancer than the northern states (Spitz
et al, 1988). In addition, it has been observed that there is an
increased risk for melanoma and lip cancers subsequent to salivary
gland cancer (Spitz et al, 1990). There is strong previous evidence
for the association of skin cancers with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
and leukaemias, implying a causative role of UV light (Adami et al,
1995). Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and SCC have been specifically
associated, with the suggestion that UV radiation may have a
suppressive effect on the immune system (Hall et al, 1995).
The great majority of the excess cancer occurrence in SCC is
associated with smoking. This includes cancer of the lung, lip,
salivary gland, oesophagus, larynx and pharynx, and leukaemia.
This is consistent with the carcinogenic effects of smoking.
