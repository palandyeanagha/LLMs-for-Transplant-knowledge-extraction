Aim: We aimed to compare the survival outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
and surgical resection (SR) for patients with small early-stage primary intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
Methods: Patients with small (≤5 cm) and early-stage ICC were screened from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Overall survival (OS) and
cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates between the SR and RFA patients were evaluated.
The results were verified using an inverse probability-weighting model (IPTW).
Results: In total, 184 patients with small T1 stage ICC that received RFA or SR treatment
were identified. The OS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 87.4, 73.3, and 61.5% for
patients who underwent SR, respectively, and 89.9, 42.4, and 23.9%, respectively, for
patients who received RFA. CSS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 91.5, 73.8, and 66.1%,
respectively, for the SR group and 93.5, 53.4, and 30.0%, respectively, for the RFA group.
The OS and CSS rates were evaluated to be significantly better in the SR group than in
the RFA group after the multivariate Cox regression and IPTW analysis. Subsequently,
the survival benefit of SR was also observed in the subgroup of patients with <4.5 or
<4 cm early-stage ICC when compared with RFA.
Conclusion: Our results indicated that the SR provided a significantly better prognosis
than RFA in patients with small and early-stage ICC. SR as the first-line treatment
of primary early-stage ICC is still recommended. However, prospective randomized
controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to compare these modalities in
the treatment of ICC.

Xiang et al. RFA vs. Resection for ICC
INTRODUCTION
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a subtype of
cholangiocarcinoma, is the second most prevalent primary
liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma (1, 2). ICC is one
of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally with
a dismal prognosis. Currently, surgical resection (SR) is the
first-line therapy for ICC. However, only 20% of the patients
with ICC are resectable when diagnosed (3). Even the small
(≤5 cm) and early-stage ICC might be unresectable due to
poor hepatic reserve, complex anatomic location of the lesion,
or underlying comorbidities (4). Moreover, almost 80% of
patients suffer from a high incidence of complications and
loss of liver function due to an extended resection (5). Besides,
about 40–70% of patients treated surgically are reported to have
positive resection margins with recurrence rates as high as 52%
(6). Therefore, effective therapeutic strategies for ICC warrants
further attention.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the several ablation
therapies for solid tumors. RFA is characterized by its technical
ease and minimal invasiveness and has been largely used
in the treatment of liver tumors, especially for small early￾stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several studies and
meta-analyses have shown that RFA has similar long-term
outcomes and is associated with shorter hospital stays and
fewer complications compared to liver resection (7). Therefore,
both RFA and hepatectomy have been recommended for the
treatment of early-stage HCC (8). Nevertheless, the use of RFA
for the treatment of ICC remains controversial. Several studies
(case reports and case series) evaluated the effectiveness and
safety of RFA in the treatment of advanced or recurrent ICC
and affirmed the therapeutic effects of RFA for the small size
(≤5 cm) ICC (9–11). However, whether RFA could be applied
to a small-size and early-stage primary ICC was unevaluated.
Furthermore, information on whether the clinical practice of
RFA in HCC could be extrapolated to ICC was unknown. The
current guidelines recommend the use of RFA in small and early￾stage (T1N0M0) ICC only for patients ineligible for resection (6).
This recommendation, however, lacks support from high-level
evidence due to the small sample size (n < 20) and heterogeneous
patient populations (patients with both primary and recurrent
ICC). In the present study, we aimed to compare the survival
outcomes of RFA and SR for patients with small early-stage
primary ICC.
METHODS
Data Source
Detailed patients’ information from 2004 to 2014 was obtained
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
database. SEER is a public database that collects survival
and incidence data of various types of cancers and covers
more than 25% of the United States’ population. SEER data
include tumor characteristics such as primary tumor site,
TNM staging of the tumor, tumor size, type of treatment,
and cause of death, and demographic characteristics such
as race, age, sex, etc. We downloaded the data from SEER
with SEER∗
Stat Software (version 8.3.4; https://seer.cancer.gov/
seerstat/).
Patients
The present study was designed as a retrospective study. The
inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients older than 18 years
old; (2) patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2014; (3) ICCs
identified by topography code C22.0 (primary liver cancer) and
histological code 8160 or 8180, or by topography code C22.1
(intrahepatic bile duct cancer) and histological code 8140, 8160,
or 8180; (4) patients with small early-stage (T1N0M0) tumors:
single lesion, no vascular invasion and extrahepatic extension
(collaborative-stage extension codes 100 and 150), without lymph
nodes or distant metastasis, and tumor size no more than 5 cm;
(5) patients with active follow-up and histological diagnosis; (6)
the ICC was the primary or the only tumor diagnosed; and (7)
patients underwent RFA (SEER code: 16) or SR (SEER code: 20–
25, 30–37, 50–52, 60, 65, and 66). Demographics of patients such
as race, age, and marital status, and tumor characteristics such as
tumor size, grade, and stage of the tumor were all extracted for
subsequent analysis. The primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and secondary outcome was cancer-specific survival (CSS).
Statistical Analysis
Patients were divided into two groups according to the
treatment they received (RFA and SR). The continuous
variables were presented as median with interquartile range
(IQR). Comparisons between treatment cohorts were analyzed
using the Student’s t-tests or the Mann–Whitney U-tests
(depending on the normal distribution and multiple testing
corrections). Categorical variables were presented as numbers
and percentages and compared by chi-square tests or Fisher’s
exact tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated
and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis was used to compare the survival
between RFA and SR. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis
was performed followed by the adjusted model. Inverse
probability weighting (IPTW) was used to verify the results
(12). The adjusted variables include the variables which showed
significance in the univariate analysis (p < 0.2). Statistical
analyses were performed with the Empower software (Waters
Corporation, Singapore).
RESULTS
Patient and Demographics Details
Of the 16,450 patients with a diagnosis of ICC in the SEER
database during 2004–2015, 184 patients met the inclusion
criteria. The screening procedure is presented in Figure 1. In
total, 150 patients received SR treatment, while 34 patients
received RFA treatment. Among the SR-treated patients, 68
underwent segmental resection (19 monosegment, 6 two
segments, 10 three segments, and 33 unclear segments), 63
underwent hepatic lobectomy (25 right lobectomy, 31 left
lobectomy, and 7 unknown side of lobectomy), and 19 underwent
the extended lobectomy. The median follow-up for patients of

SR group was 32 months (IQR, 26–37), and for RFA group was
31 months (IQR, 25–34). Most of the baseline characteristics
for the SR and RFA groups were well balanced (Table 1). The
median tumor size in the RFA group was smaller than the SR
group. The tumor grade was the only variable with uneven
distribution in the two groups (p < 0.001). This is because the
tumor grade was unknown in the majority of the patients from
the RFA group.
Survival Analysis of Patients With ICC
We perform survival analysis with the overall survival as
the primary outcome and the cancer-specific survival as the
secondary outcome. The overall survival was measured from the
date of resection or RFA to the date of all-cause death. Cancer￾specific survival was measured from the date of resection or
RFA to the date of death from cancer. In patients with small
and early-stage ICC, the SR group had a significantly better OS
compared to the RFA group (p < 0.001, Figure 2A). The OS
rates for the SR group at 1, 3, and 5 years were 87.4, 73.3, and
61.5%, respectively, and 89.9, 42.4, and 23.9%, respectively, for
the RFA group (Table 2). After adjusting by the race, marital
status, tumor size, and tumor grade, the patients who underwent
SR still had a significantly better OS than patients who received
RFA (p = 0.001). And SR patients had a better CSS than RFA
patients (p < 0.001, Figure 2B). CSS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were
91.5, 73.8, and 66.1%, respectively, for the SR group and 93.5,
53.4, and 30.0%, respectively, for the RFA group (Table 3). After
adjusting by the year of diagnosis, tumor size, and tumor grade,
there was still a significantly better CSS in the SR group than
the RFA group (p = 0.001). In the inverse probability-weighting
model, a significantly better OS and CSS could also be observed in
the SR group compared to the RFA group in patients with <5 cm
ICC (OS hazard ratio, 2.15; 95% CI: 1.30–3.54; p = 0.003 and CSS
hazard ratio, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.24–3.98; p = 0.07).
The effectiveness of RFA was affected by the tumor size, and
for the evaluation of whether tumor size smaller than 5 cm
would have influence on the above results, we performed a
stratification analysis based on the tumor size. As showed in
Supplementary Tables 1, 2, the SR group had a significantly
better OS and CSS than the RFA group in patients of
tumor size <4.5 cm (p < 0.001, Supplementary Figures 1A,D).
Additionally, in patients with tumor size <4.5 or 4.0 cm, the
OS and CSS of patients from SR group were still significantly
better than that of patients from the RFA group (p < 0.05 in
Supplementary Figures 1B,C,E,F).
Due to a low sample size (<20 patients in the RFA group),
the multivariate Cox and IPTW analysis was not performed in
patients with <3.5 or 3 cm ICC. For patients with <3 cm ICC,
we draw the survival curves and calculated the survival rate of
patients from the SR and RFA groups (Figure 3). The OS rates
at 1, 3, and 5 years were 84.0, 74.2, and 66.2%, respectively, for
the SR group and 88.9, 77.8, and 58.3%, respectively, for the RFA
group. The median survival was 38 months for the SR group and
39 months for RFA group. The CSS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years
were 89.2, 81.7, and 72.9%, respectively, for the SR group and
89.5, 87.5, and 62.5%, respectively, for the RFA group. Among
the RFA patients, the 5-year OS rate improved from 23.9 to 58.3%
after patients with tumor size >3 cm were excluded from analysis
(Supplementary Table 1). The 5-year CSS rate also improved
from 30.0 to 62.5% (Supplementary Table 2). There might be
a comparable survival rate between the SR and RFA groups;
however, the non-inferiority analysis was not allowed due to the
low sample size in this comparison.
DISCUSSION
At present, although the technological advancements in the
diagnosis and surgical resection of malignant tumors are
underway, the incidence rates and mortality rates of ICC are

intensifying worldwide (6). Therefore, innovative alternative
techniques for the treatment of ICC are essential. RFA is an
alternative liver-targeted therapy, which applies heat to destroy
a tumor without damaging the surrounding liver tissue. Recent
studies on HCC have shown that RFA can achieve results similar
to hepatectomy in the treatment of small early-stage HCC.
However, the feasibility of RFA in the treatment of ICC is
still controversial.
In 2002, Slakey (13) reported the first case of ICC treatment
with RFA. The results showed that RFA might increase the
surgical resection rate of patients. Recently, several studies have
demonstrated RFA treatment for patients with recurrent ICC.
For instance, Kamphues et al. (14) assessed 13 ICC patients
who underwent repeated resection and RFA. They found that
repeated resection combined with RFA was safe and effective,
and the median survival time of these patients was 51 months.
Fu et al. evaluated the effectiveness of RFA for the treatment
of patients with recurrent ICC. The median overall survival
was 30 months for the 12 patients who lost the chance for
the repeated resection (11). In another study by Kim et al.
(15), the technical effectiveness rate of RFA in the treatment
of recurrent ICC reached 97%, and the median survival rate
after RFA was 27.4 months. Repeated resection was suggested
to be the acceptable technique in the treatment of recurrent
ICC. Other studies by Ohtsuka et al. (16) and Song et al. (17)
reported that repeated surgical resection of recurrent ICC can
provide long-term survival opportunities for patients. However,
for patients with poor liver reserve function, the effectiveness
of repeated surgical resection was not favorable. Zhang et al.
compared the efficacy of RFA and repeated surgical resection
in patients with recurrent ICC. In this study, 109 patients with
recurrent ICC underwent repeated surgical resection or thermal
ablation after radical surgery (18). The results showed that the OS
rate of repeated resection patients was similar to that of thermal
ablation patients. Thermal ablation can be an effective treatment
for recurrent ICC, but its use should be limited to tumors <3 cm
in diameter (18). This study was one of the few studies comparing
SR and RFA for the treatment of ICC.
Several studies have assessed the efficacy of RFA in the
treatment of advanced ICC. Chiou et al. (19) evaluated the
perioperative outcomes of RFA in the treatment of advanced ICC
with 10 patients. Carrafiello et al. (9) shared their preliminary
experiment of the RFA for the unresectable ICC, and the short￾term follow-up results confirmed the applicability of RFA. Kim
et al. (20) found that RFA offered a successful tumor control in
the treatment of 13 patients with 17 advanced ICC; the median
survival rate reached 38.5 months. While the median survival
rate of resection ICC patients was 27.6 months, it was only
12.9 months for the non-surgical candidates with varied palliative
treatment in a study by Dhanasekaran et al. (21). Recently, Wu
et al. (22) found that for patients with unresectable ICC, RFA
was associated with significantly better survival rates compared
with chemoradiotherapy. RFA was recommended as one of the
standard treatments for ICC in the European Association for the
Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, although the evidence level
was only C2 (6).
Previously, RFA has been recommended for patients with
early-stage ICC where surgery is not an option. However, this

recommendation lacked verification due to the lack of studies
on the use of RFA for the treatment of primary early-stage ICC.
In the present study, 184 patients with small T1 stage ICC who
received either RFA or SR were selected. The prognosis of patients
who received different treatment modalities was compared. Our
results showed that SR provided a significantly better survival rate
than RFA in patients with small and early-stage ICC (T1N0M0,
tumor size <5 cm). And whether the RFA could provide a
comparable prognosis benefit as the SR in patients with <3 cm
ICC should be explored in future studies, although a similar
median survival was observed in the present study. The 5-year
OS rate after the RFA treatment for patients with <3 cm ICC
reached 58.3%. The size of the tumor had a great effect on the
implementation of RFA. Generally, the complete necrosis of a
tumor bigger than 5 cm is difficult to achieve in a single RFA
session, as there is always a residual tumor. Therefore, only
patients with a tumor <5 cm are screened for RFA treatment
studies. In studies by Carrafiello et al. (9) and Kim et al. (15),
patients with <3 cm ICC had less residual tumor, lower recurrent
rate, and almost no complications after the RFA treatment. The
difference between the geometry of the tumor and the necrosis
induced by RFA always leads to insufficient ablation of larger

tumors. Although multimodality RFA has been considered a
feasible method for the treatment of large tumors, its application
in the treatment of ICC is limited (23). Other factors that affect
the success rate of RFA are tumor location and surrounding tissue
(24). The central tumor is more difficult to be successfully treated
because of the heat loss caused by the extensive blood vessels in
the liver hilum. In the process of RFA, heat loss occurs at the
tip of the needle, mainly through blood circulation. Difficulties
in the ablation of such tumors may be overcome by stereotactic
planning of multiple overlapping ablations, which should be
explored in future studies.
In addition to the inherent limitations of the retrospective
study such as the selective basis, there were other limitations
in the study. First, although a population-based database was
utilized to screen patients, the sample size in our study was
still small; all the comparisons that included low sample size
for survival analysis should be verified in future studies. Second,
information for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the
survival analysis did not contain the details of the protocols,
which was also not available in the SEER database. Third,
disease-free survival could not be determined due to the lack
of information on the local recurrence in the SEER database.
Fourth, the liver function and other comorbidities of the patients
were not assessed. Fifth, different types of resections and tumor
locations might have led to bias. Sixth, stereotactic RFA patients
could not be identified due to the limitation of the SEER,

although stereotactic RFA was suggested to be feasible for large￾size tumors or subcapsular tumor location. Finally, we could
not obtain data on surgical margin status in the SEER; surgical
margin status was an important prognostic factor in patients with
resectable ICC.
CONCLUSION
The present study illustrated that the SR provided a significantly
better prognosis than RFA in patients with small and early￾stage ICC (T1N0M0, tumor size <5 cm). SR as the first-line
treatment of primary early-stage ICC is still recommended.
Whether the RFA could provide a comparable prognosis
benefit as the SR in patients with <3 cm ICC should
be explored in future studies with more included patients.
Prospective randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes
are necessary to compare these modalities in the treatment
of ICC.
