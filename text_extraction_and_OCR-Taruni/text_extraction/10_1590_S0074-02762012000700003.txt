The term phaeohyphomycosis (from the Greek 
phaios, meaning dark or darkish) was introduced by 
Ajello et al. in 1974 to designate infections by phaeoid 
or pigmented filamentous fungi that contain melanin in 
their walls. These microorganisms are saprobes in na￾ture, found in wood and decomposing plants. Superficial 
cutaneous and corneal manifestations of the mycosis are 
more frequent and develop among healthy individuals. 
The designations of tinea nigra, black piedra and my￾cotic keratitis, which are commonly used, should not be 
replaced by phaeohyphomycosis (McGuinnis 1983). Cu￾taneous and systemic phaeohyphomycosis occur in im￾munocompromised patients. These infections are con￾sidered to be rare (Rossman et al. 1996).
Microscopically, the aetiological agents present as 
yeast elements, pseudo-hyphae, septate hyphae, rami￾fied hyphae (short or long; regular or curled) or a com￾bination of these findings with a brownish colouration 
(Mostert et al. 2005). The main genera involved include 
Alternaria, Bipolaris, Cladophialophora and Exophiala 
(Matsumoto & Ajello, de Hoog et al. 2000). Phaeohy￾phomycosis can be distinguished from two other subcu￾taneous mycoses caused by phaeoid fungi: Chromoblas￾tomycosis and Mycetoma. The differential diagnosis is 
established by the presence of muriform cells (sclerotic 
bodies) or black grains in cases of chromoblastomycosis 
and mycetoma, respectively (McGuinnis 1983).
The laboratory diagnosis is first based on the mor￾phological characteristics of the agents as observed by 
direct microscopic examination and histopathology. 
The diagnosis is necessarily supported by the examina￾tion of cultures to identify the genus and species of the 
aetiological agent (Lacaz et al. 2002). The rarity of this 
mycosis justifies describing the clinical, epidemiologi￾cal and diagnostic characteristics to aid in its immediate 
recognition and early treatment.
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clini￾cal data, epidemiological data and diagnoses of 18 cases 
of phaeohyphomycosis identified between 1995-2010 
by the Mycology Laboratory of the Santa Casa Medical 
Centre, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. 
The medical records of all of the patients were analy￾sed in relation to sex, age, race, predisposing diseases, 
anatomical location and time elapsed between the mani￾festation of the disease and its diagnosis. The study was 
approved by the Committee of Research and Ethical of 
Santa Casa Medical Centre (protocol 3098/89).
Laboratory diagnosis - Fragments of surgically re￾moved tissue were submitted for histological process￾ing, maintained within paraffin blocks and stained by 
standard techniques for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), 
Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) (useful in the study 
of fungal micromorphology) and the Fontana-Masson 
(FM) special technique, which detects the presence of 
melanin in fungal walls (Wood & Russel-Bell 1983, 
Kimura & McGinnis 1998). The direct examination of 
the tissue fragments was performed by mounting and 
clarification in a solution of 10% potassium hydroxide.

The goal of this study was to review 18 cases of phaeohyphomycosis in Rio Grande do Sul. The records of all of 
the patients with a diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis between 1995-2010 were reviewed. Twelve of the 18 patients 
(66.6%) were male. The average age of the patients was 50 years old (range: 16-74 years). Eleven patients (61%) 
presented with subcutaneous lesions. Seven patients (38.8%) had received a solid organ transplant. In all of the 
cases, the presence of melanin in the fungal cells was determined by Fontana-Masson staining of tissue sections and 
documented. Among the 18 patients, a total of 11 different fungal species were isolated. The causative organisms 
included Exophiala jeanselmei, Alternaria, Curvularia, Cladophialophora and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. To 
our knowledge, this review reports the first case of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by C. gloeosporioides
in a lung transplant patient. The number of reported cases of phaeohyphomycosis has increased in the last decade. 
In a number of cases, this increased incidence may be primarily attributed to iatrogenic immunodeficiency.

ogy varying from yeast-like to velvety (depending on the 
species) and olive-brown to black, when incubated at 25ºC 
in Sabouraud agar with or without antibiotics and BBL™ 
Mycosel™ agar. The cultures were maintained from two￾four weeks. For the examination of microscopic morphol￾ogy, the isolates were submitted to cultures in blades us￾ing potato agar. The identification of genus and species 
was based on various morphological characteristics.
RESULTS
Most of the patients were male (12/18) and between 
16-74 years of age (average 50 years) and all of the pa￾tients were Caucasian. The most frequently observed 
symptom was subcutaneous nodules (11/18; 61%) and 
the most commonly associated or predisposing condition 
was solid organ transplantation (7/18; 38.8%) (Table).
The lesions were present on the lower limbs in 62% 
(10/18) of the cases (Fig. 1A). In one cerebral lesion in the 
subarachnoid space and fourth ventricle (case 10), a green￾ish purulent material with dark punctate areas caused by 
melanin in the fungal wall was observed (Fig. 2A).
Granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid his￾tiocytes and giant cells was observed in all of the cases. 
In seven cases, necrotising granulomatous inflammation 
with suppuration was observed. Central areas of necro￾sis and marginal areas of fibrosis were present in six 
cases. Pigmented spherical structures (Figs 1B, 3A) and 
filaments (Figs 2B, 3B) were detected in the inflamma￾tory areas. In one case, the fungal elements were hyaline 
(case 12). Under microscopy, the fungi were observed 
either as isolated cells or inside giant cells (phagocytes). 
When stained with GMS silver stain, the fungal struc￾tures were well defined. In all of the cases, numerous 
polymorphic elements were observed, including yeast 
(dilated or irregularly shaped, some with budding), pseu￾do-hyphae and simple or ramified hyphae (short or long; 
regular or curled) (Fig. 4A). In all of the cases, there was 
a positive melanin reaction as detected by FM staining 
of the fungi (Fig. 4B).
Isolation in culture was conducted in 11 (61%) of the 
cases. In seven cases (38.8%), no fungal isolation was 
conducted (Table). The aetiological agents identified 
were as follows: five Exophiala jeanselmei, two Alter￾naria sp., one Curvularia, two Cladophialophora sp.
and one Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
C. gloeosporioides is a rare agent of subcutaneous 
phaeohyphomycosis; therefore, we decided to describe the 
clinical history of case 12. The patient was a male, Cauca￾sian, 53 years old and six years post-transplant of the left 
lung due to secondary emphysema as a consequence of 
work-related disease. He presented with an ulceration 1.5 
cm in diameter, with a necrotic bottom, close to the left 
malleolus, which was treated topically with azathioprine, 
prednisone and cyclosporine for five months without 
healing. The patient had a history of systemic hyperten￾sion and cardiac arrhythmia. He presented with cough￾ing, productive expectoration and a fever of 38-40ºC. The 
lung tomographic study did not reveal relevant alterations 
with the exception of a minimal infiltration in the trans￾planted lung. The direct mycological examination and ac￾id-fast bacillus stain of the sputum were negative. Three 
haemocultures had negative results as well. 
Histopathology and microbiology - A popliteal cyst 
with unepithelialised wall cavities, fibrosis, granuloma￾tous inflammation with abscess and foreign body granu￾loma was removed surgically. Acid-fast bacilli were not 
found in the biopsy material. Microscopy of the biopsy 
material revealed septate and branched hyaline hyphae 
with enlarged extremities (by H&E staining) and the 
presence of melanin in the fungal wall (by FM staining). 
A dark colony was isolated in Sabouraud agar at 25ºC. 
The aetiological diagnosis was possible only by compar￾ative genetic sequencing (sequence: ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 of 
Colletotrichum in the GenBank database). 
Evolution - The fungal lesion was treated by total 
surgical removal. The patient presented new lesions sug￾gestive of infections with herpes simplex virus in and 
around the perianal region. The patient died under suspi￾cion of diarrhoea caused by cytomegalovirus infection. 
An autopsy was not allowed. 
Comment - The possibility of phaeohyphomycosis 
should be considered not only when naturally brown fun￾gal elements are observed under direct microscopy of the 
clinical specimen, but also when hyaline fungal structures 
(Mayser et al. 2002) are present in the tissues, which can 
be mistaken for other mycologic diagnoses (Lopes et al. 
1994). Infections caused by species of the Colletotrichum
genus have been reported as both phaeohyphomycosis 
(Matsumoto & Ajello 1998, Castro et al. 2001) and hyalo￾hyphomycosis (Guarro et al. 1998), although the prevalent 
diagnosis is phaeohyphomycosis (Guarro et al. 1998).
DISCUSSION
Phaeohyphomycosis is a clinical entity that is diag￾nosed when darkly pigmented fungal elements (hyphae, 
pseudo-hyphae and yeast cells) are observed in a clinical 
specimen. The subcutaneous presence of the disease dis￾tinguishes phaeohyphomycosis from the other two my￾Fig. 1: subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis by Exophiala jeanselmei

coses caused by black fungi, chromoblastomycosis and 
eumycotic mycetoma. In cases of chromoblastomycosis, 
muriform cells with septation along one or two planes in 
different levels are observed in the tissue. In mycetoma, 
the fungus presents in tissues as a microcolony of hy￾phae in the shape of grains (Matsumoto & Ajello 1998). 
Reviewing the relevant literature in RS, we found 
cases of phaeohyphomycosis (including cases 1, 2, 10 
and 15 of the current series, which have been previously 
published) as follows: peritoneal, one case caused by 
Curvularia lunata (Lopes et al. 1994), cutaneous, one 
case caused by C. lunata (Lopes & Jobim 1998), sub￾cutaneous, 10 cases, including two cases with only his￾Fig. 2: systemic phaeohyphomycosis (cerebral) by Cladophialophora 
bantiana (case 10). A: section of brain lesion showing the fourth ven￾tricle with a macroscopic dark colour, due to the dematiaceous hy￾phae; B: specimen collected from the fourth cerebral ventricle show￾ing large number of dematiaceous hyphae, septate, after clarification 
with of potassium hydroxide 20% (H&E: 400X).

with thick walls, noting the structure internally divided by a trans￾verse septum (H&E: 100X); B: a large number of fragments of dema￾tiaceous hyphae (H&E: 100X).
topathological diagnoses available (Severo et al. 1987), 
one case caused by E. jeanselmei, one case caused by 
Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and one caused by Pha￾eoacremonium rubrigenum (Guarro et al. 2003), and 
systemic, one case caused by Cladophialophora ban￾tiana (Walz et al. 1997). Re-evaluation of morphologi￾cal characteristics, supported by phylogenetic analysis, 
identified P. aleophilum as a new fungal species, Pha￾eoacremonium alvesti (Mostert et al. 2005).
In our series, the aetiological agent was not identified 
in several cases due to the routine procedure of placing the 
surgical material directly into formaldehyde, making it 
impossible to isolate the fungus by culture. In these cases, 
the diagnosis remained incomplete, as the inflammatory 
reaction and the tissue presentation of fungal elements are 
nonspecific in absence of serological testing (Cases 1-7). 
However, it should be stressed that although histopatho￾logical examination cannot identify the aetiological agent, 
it is the most likely manner in which a general diagnosis 
of phaeohyphomycosis is initially determined.
Immunosuppressant therapy in patients with solid 
organ transplants was the primary associated or predis￾posing condition. It is important to stress that patients 
treated with tacrolimus more frequently presented with 
infections by filamentous fungi, presented with much 
more serious disease and were more resistant to treat￾ment compared with patients suffering another type of 
immunosuppressive disorder (Pereiro et al. 2004). 
E. jeanselmei is expected to be the main aetiological 
agent of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis due to its wide 
presence in nature. C. bantiana is expected to be the aeti￾ological agent of systemic phaeohyphomycosis with brain 
damage due to its favourable neurotropism. C. gloeospori￾oides was an unexpected finding as the cause of subcuta￾neous phaeohyphomycosis in a patient with a transplanted 
lung. The aetiological characterisation was possible by 
Fig. 4: systemic phaeohyphomycosis (pulmonary) (case 5). Biopsy of the 
endobronchial lesion. A: presence of pseudohyphae and regular short 
hyphae (Grocott methenamine silver: 40X); B: tissue section demon￾strated the combination of yeast cells, hyphae and pseudo-hyphae with 
positive melanin reaction (Fontana-Masson staining: 100X).

molecular biology (polymerase chain reaction) only, as it 
was not possible to conduct a microscopic examination of 
the fungal colonies. However, in recent years, five species 
of the Colletotrichum genus have been reported as agents 
of human infections (Cano et al. 2004).
The frequency of fungal infections is increasing as 
a consequence of interventions that affect the host’s im￾mune system (Revankar 2004). Therefore, the isolation 
of a fungal agent from any patient, no matter how remote 
or unusual it may appear, should alert clinical physicians 
and microbiologists to its potential pathogenicity, espe￾cially in the presence of immunosuppression.
