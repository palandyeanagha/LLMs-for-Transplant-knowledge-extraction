Abstract
Introduction Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most 
common complication following major gastrointestinal 
surgery, affecting between 25% and 40% of patients. 
The rate of SSI doubles from low-income to high￾income settings, persisting after risk adjustment. The 
relative impact of antibiotic-resistant organisms and 
the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis globally are 
unknown. This study aims to determine SSI rates following 
gastrointestinal surgery across worldwide hospital 
settings.
Methods and analysis This multicentre, international, 
prospective cohort study will be undertaken by 
any hospital providing emergency or elective 
gastroenterological surgical services. Centres will collect 
observational data on consecutive patients undergoing 
emergency or elective gastrointestinal resection, 
cholecystectomy or appendicectomy during a 6-month 
period. The primary outcome is the incidence of SSI with 
secondary outcomes describing the organisms causing 
SSIs, including their antibiotic susceptibility, and the 
microbiological tests used to identify them.
Ethics and dissemination This project will not affect 
clinical practice and has been classified as clinical 
audit following research ethics review. The protocol will 
be disseminated through the international GlobalSurg 
network.
Trial registration number NCT02662231.
Introduction
The burden of surgical disease in low 
and middle-income countries (LMICs) is 
growing.1
 Specific programmes have aimed 
to highlight the unmet need for safe surgery 
and anaesthesia as part of the global health 
agenda.2
 The Lancet Commission on Global 
Surgery outlined six core indicators for 
the assessment of global surgical systems, 
including the postoperative mortality rate 
(POMR).3
 While clearly important, mortality 
only affects 1%–4% of all patients.4
 For major 
gastrointestinal surgery, quantifying POMR 
alone neglects the burden of postoperative 
morbidity, which affects a greater propor￾tion of patients.2
 Other relevant markers 
of postoperative outcome are also needed 
to determine the success of surgery in the 
majority of patients who will survive.
Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most 
common complication following major 
gastrointestinal surgery,5
 affecting between 
25% and 40% of patients after midline 
laparotomy in high-income settings.6 7 SSI 
is implicated in one-third of postoperative 
deaths and accounts for 8% of all deaths

Protocol
Strengths and limitations of this study
► This will be the first international, multicentre, 
prospective study to assess the incidence of surgical 
site infections (SSI) for patients undergoing elective 
and emergency major gastrointestinal surgery.
► The collaborative methodology adopted, as 
described elsewhere, allows for large volume, high￾quality data collection while avoiding overburdening 
high-volume and low-resource centres that may 
otherwise be unable to participate in such projects.
► Previous studies have had varying subjective 
definitions of SSI; this study uses standardised 
definitions from the Centre for Disease Control and 
Prevention, which are widely implemented and 
internationally validated.
► Due to the observational nature of the study, it 
will not be possible to determine a causative 
link between risk factors and SSI and therefore 
comparisons of incidence and risk factors across 
different Human Development Index settings will be 
hypothesis generating only.
► As it is not possible to apply strict data monitoring 
within the confines of this study, we have developed 
a mixed-methods quantitative and qualitative 
validation process for our primary outcome measure, 
and case ascertainment rate, which will be applied 
to a sample of representative centres.

Box 1 Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria
► Patients of all ages (adult and paediatric) 
► Consecutive patients during a chosen 14-day study period 
► Undergoing emergency or elective gastrointestinal resection, 
cholecystectomy and appendicectomy 
► Includes open, laparoscopic, laparoscopic converted  and robotic 
cases 
► Primary indication of trauma should be included 
► Hernia repair with bowel resection should be included 
Exclusion criteria 
► Operations with a primary indication classified as vascular surgery, 
gynaecology, urology or transplantation 
► Caesarean sections 
► Whipple procedure 
► Simple hernia repair 
caused by a nosocomial infection.8–10 Furthermore, SSIs 
cause pain and discomfort, increase hospital stay and put 
patients at greater risk of secondary infectious complica￾tions. This has an important economic impact with an 
attributable cost in the UK of £30million per year.
11
Our 2014/2015 prospective, observational cohort 
study (GlobalSurg 112) included 10475 patients from 58 
countries. It showed that the incidence of SSI more than 
doubled from high (7.4%), to middle (14.4%), to low 
(20.0%)-income countries. This persisted after multivari￾able risk adjustment for patient and hospital confounders 
(middle income: OR 1.96 (1.63–2.32) and low income: 
OR 2.06 (1.67–2.57)). In the most contaminated proce￾dures, one in three patients from LMICs suffered an SSI. 
Dirty surgery doubled in low-income countries (29.7% vs 
16.6% in high-income settings), which was in turn asso￾ciated with doubling of SSI (34.5% low income vs 15.4% 
high income). However, SSI was assessed as a secondary 
outcome measure as part of that study, lacking validity 
and requiring external validation.
Antibiotic-resistant organisms are now prevalent 
worldwide and a focus of interest for policy leaders and 
global health advocates.13 In high-income settings, meth￾icillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounts for up to 
50% of S. aureus infections.14 While many hospitals in 
low-income settings are not able to routinely perform 
surveillance of resistant patterns, yet the little evidence 
that does exist suggests an accelerating incidence of anti￾biotic-resistant SSIs.15 Patients with antibiotic-resistant 
infections have a higher risk of mortality and morbidity, 
and require more healthcare resources.16 Currently, few 
data exist describing the international epidemiology of 
SSIs, the causative organisms or incidence of antimi￾crobial drug resistance. Investigating the diagnosis and 
treatment of SSIs is an urgent global health priority, with 
important implications for patients, clinicians and poli￾cymakers.
Primary aims
The primary aim is to determine the incidence of SSI 
following elective and emergency gastrointestinal surgery 
across low, middle and high Human Development Index 
(HDI) countries.
Secondary aims
The secondary aims include describing the organisms 
causing SSIs, the incidence of antibiotic-resistant patho￾gens and the microbiological tests used to identify them. 
The impact of the method of 30-day follow-up on these 
outcomes, where performed, will also be analysed.
Methods
Study design
This is a multicentre, international, prospective, observa￾tional cohort study of all consecutive patients undergoing 
elective or emergency gastrointestinal surgery over a 
14-day period. Individual collaborators are free to choose 
any 14-day period within the 6-month study period to 
collect data. The study will run from 4 January 2016 to 
31 July (with 30-day follow-up of the last data collection 
period finishing on 30 August 2016). This ‘snapshot’ 
study design is a validated model that has been delivered 
successfully in previous studies.6 17 18
The GlobalSurg network
GlobalSurg (http://globalsurg.org/) is an international 
research collaborative, fostering regional, national and 
international surgical networks. The collaborative model 
used has previously been described elsewhere19 and has 
already facilitated one multicentre, international, prospec￾tive cohort study.20 GlobalSurg is run by the Surgical 
Research Gateway (SuRG) Foundation (http://surg￾foundation.org/; registered charity number 1159898), 
in collaboration with the University of Birmingham and 
University of Edinburgh. The objective of the charity is to 
advance the education of medical students and doctors in 
surgical science, clinical research and audit methods by 
promoting participation in collaborative clinical research 
and audit studies.
Study setting
Any surgical unit providing emergency or elective surgery 
worldwide is eligible to participate. Included centres must 
capture all consecutive patients and ensure data collec￾tion is >95%complete. Centres with >5% missing data, 
when including all possible data points, will be excluded 
from the final analysis and removed from authorship. 
The minimum number of patients that must be recruited 
is 1. Multiple teams covering different non-overlapping 
time periods at each hospital are encouraged.
Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients of all ages (adult and paediatric) undergoing 
elective, semielective or emergency gastrointestinal resec￾tion, cholecystectomy or appendicectomy are eligible 
to enter (box 1). Any operative approach can be used. 
Operations with a primary indication classified as vascular 
surgery, gynaecology, urology or transplantation should 
be excluded.

Box 2 Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
criteria for surgical site infection (SSI)21
CDC criteria for SSI require the patient to have at least one of the 
following:
► Purulent drainage from the superficial or deep (fascia or muscle) 
incision but not from within the organ/space component of the 
surgical site 
► At least one of the following: pain or tenderness; localised swelling; 
redness; heat; fever and the incision is opened deliberately or 
spontaneously dehisces 
► Abscess within the wound (clinical, histopathological or 
radiological detection) 
Emergency procedures are defined as unplanned 
operations and include reoperations after previous 
procedures. Semielective procedures are defined as 
procedures planned on the background of the patient 
being discharged after an emergency admission in the 
past and is currently admitted for surgery. Gastrointes￾tinal resection is defined as a complete transection and 
removal of a segment of the oesophagus, stomach, small 
bowel, colon or rectum.
Each individual patient should be included once into 
the study. Patients who return to theatre due to complica￾tions following earlier surgery can only be included if the 
index procedure is not already included.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure is the incidence of super￾ficial or deep incisional SSI within 30 days of surgery 
involving any of the operative incisions made. This 
measure adopts the definitions within the 2008 Centre 
for Disease Control and Prevention21 definitions of SSI 
(box 2). Where it is unfeasible to follow-up the patients 
after discharge for 30 days postoperatively, in-hospital SSI 
incidence will be used as a proxy measure.
The secondary outcomes that will be derived from this 
study include:
1. a description of the global variation in organisms 
causing SSI (including use of microbiological tests);
2. the incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens 
detected in patients with SSI;
3. 30-day POMR;
4. 30-day postoperative reintervention rate;
5. assessing how difference in SSI rates varies based on 
the method by which patients are followed up.
Data points
Data points relating to patient, immunosuppression 
status, operative method and postoperative period will be 
collected (table 1). In order to maximise data complete￾ness, a minimal data set has been designed to test only 
factors relevant to the outcome measures. Investigators 
will enter data via the secure internet-based Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.22 Anonymous 
patient data will be held on the system hosted by the 
University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.
Investigators
The study will be undertaken by investigators around 
the world who will be responsible for disseminating 
the protocol at their individual site, ensuring appro￾priate study approvals are in place and collecting 
and uploading data to an online REDCap database. 
A central study writing committee compromising of 
an internationally representative group of healthcare 
professionals will be responsible for data analysis, final 
manuscript drafting and submission. Individuals will be 
required to register their unit via the REDCap system 
and will be required to complete two training modules 
prior to starting.
Countries with multiple sites will be assigned a country 
lead, who will be responsible for coordinating multiple 
teams across sites to ensure duplication of data does not 
occur. Each hospital will have a primary local investigator 
who will act as guarantor of data. A maximum of three 
local investigators can cover each 2-week data collec￾tion period. They will be responsible for gaining local 
audit, service evaluation or research ethics approval as 
appropriate to their institution. Investigators should 
also create clear mechanisms to identify and include all 
eligible patients, which involves daily review of operating 
logbooks, emergency admission lists and team handover 
lists. They should identify clear pathways to accurately 
collect baseline and follow-up data and be proactive in 
identifying postoperative events within the normal limits 
of follow-up.
Local arrangements for follow-up may include daily 
review of the patient and notes during admission and 
before discharge in order to identify in-hospital SSIs, 
reviewing patient status in outpatient clinics or via tele￾phone interview at 30days (if this normal practice), 
checking hospital notes (paper or electronic) and looking 
at handover lists. All investigators will be listed as collabo￾rators on resulting publications.
Quality of data
To ensure high data quality, a detailed protocol has been 
produced and published online. The protocol has been 
translated into common languages to ease investigator 
understanding, including Chinese (traditional and simpli￾fied), Spanish, Italian, Greek, Portuguese and Arabic.23
In addition, investigators are mandated to complete two 
online educational modules, one a summary of the study 
protocol and the other an overview of the diagnosis and 
classification of SSI.
Data validation
Data validation will be performed in two parts across 
a group of representative centres. Case completeness 
assessment will involve an independent investigator ascer￾taining the number of eligible cases within a 2-week data 
collection period at a participating centre and comparing 
this to actual number of cases submitted. Data accuracy 
will be assessed using qualitative, semistructured inter￾views with investigators to assess local data collection 
methods.

Statistical analysis and power calculation
Identification of hospital or surgeon-specific perfor￾mance will not be reported. Variation in outcome 
across different contexts will be tested using the HDI24
(a composite statistic of life expectancy, education and 
income indices). Following analysis, centre-specific 
SSI rates will be fed back to participants. Hierarchical 
logistic regression multivariate analysis will be used to 
adjust the influence of HDI on SSI rates for confounding 
patient and disease variables. We will subgroup patients 
according to operative procedure for the purpose of 
analysis.
An appropriate sample size is difficult to calculate in 
this setting as there is a lack of previous study data to indi￾cate the incidence of SSIs internationally. The previous 
GlobalSurg study recruited 10745 patients using the same 
methodology.
25Although the inclusion criterion for this 
study is different, we expect to achieve a similar number 
of patients. Based on the findings from GlobalSurg 1, this 
number will provide adequate power to show a minimum 
difference from 7% to 10% in SSI rate between two 
groups (80% power at 5% alpha requires a sample size of 
1350 patients).
Trial registration number
This study has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(identifier: NCT02662231). The registration is avail￾able to view via: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/

(box 3). As this study will not change local clinical prac￾tice and is limited to using data obtained as part of usual 
care, it has been classified as an audit by the South East 
Scotland Research Ethics Service in Edinburgh, Scotland 
(online supplementary file 1). Thus, this may be consid￾ered a global audit or global service evaluation.
Investigators are required to gain approval from the 
relevant responsible bodies, including local clinical audit 
departments, research and development departments or 
institutional review boards, as appropriate in their centre. 
If such departments are unavailable, written permission 
should be supplied by the chief of surgery or the respon￾sible supervising consultant/attending physician.
Protocol dissemination
The protocol will be disseminated across the estab￾lished GlobalSurg network, compromised of surgeons, 
medical students and research nurses across the world. 
The network previously included over 1200 collaborators 
across 375 centres representing 58 countries.12 Country 
leads are responsible for local coordination and dissem￾ination within their country. In addition, the use of 
social media including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 
has been shown to be an effective medium for dissem￾ination of such collaborative projects27 and will also be 
employed.
Dissemination of results
We aim to publish the study results as open access. Data 
from the study will be described to ensure individual coun￾tries, hospitals and surgeons are anonymous and then 
shall be deposited in an online data repository for others 
to analyse. Based on the results of GlobalSurg 2 Study, a 
quality improvement protocol and/or interventional clin￾ical trials will be suggested for possible application in the 
infection control units of each hospital included in this 
study.
Discussion
In this study protocol, we describe a multicentre, inter￾national, prospective cohort study investigating the 
incidence of SSI and its association with preoperative 
parameters and risk factors as well as with postopera￾tive morbidity and mortality. Despite SSI being the most 
common complication following major gastrointestinal 
surgery, no data exist describing its global epidemiology. 
Similarly, appendicectomies and cholecystectomies are 
two of the most common intra-abdominal operations 
performed; yet the international burden of SSI for these 
patients remains unknown.
By using collaborative methodology17 and a short 
2-week data collection period, the study will recruit suffi￾cient numbers of patients to inform this, while avoiding 
burdening low-resource centres that may otherwise be 
unable to participate. By investigating the morbidity 
and mortality caused by SSIs globally, this study will 
provide a platform to build future quality improvement 
programmes and interventional trials.
This study will be delivered using an international 
multidisciplinary collaborative network of healthcare 
researchers. The collaborative model has consistently 
proven potential for producing high-quality outcomes 
data with limited resource requirements across 
national6 18 28 and international studies.4
 A detailed 
study protocol and mandatory completion of online 
training modules will ensure standardised definitions 
and understanding of SSI so that this study will deliver 
a reliable and accurate data set. A predefined data 
validation strategy will produce an estimate of case 
ascertainment and the quality of local methods used to 
gather data.
SSIs have been shown to increase costs by an average 
of US$20842 in high-income countries, which signifi￾cantly burden healthcare systems.29 Within low-income 
countries, healthcare-associated infections have been esti￾mated to have an increased incidence.30 This can result in 
an increased length of stay of an average 9.7days longer 
and has further knock-on effects to dependants which 
are more profound in the low-income setting.29 To help 
address this fiscal disparity, this project will inform future 
service-level quality improvement programmes. When 
regular audits of pathogens and antibiotic prescribing are 
undertaken, redundant antibiotic use is reduced.31 32 With 
feedback of baseline SSI rates to participating centres, 
collaborators have the opportunity to appraise their 
current practice against a global standard. Surgeons will 
be able to implement interventions to improve service 
provision prior to a reaudit, 1year in the future. With 
the savings made from the implementation of preven￾tion programmes being 11 times greater on average than 
costs,33 these programmes will help reduce fiscal burden 
to patients and public health systems.
Many important determinants of a high burden of SSI 
in developing countries have not been identified.5 This 
study will be able to identify an association between SSIs 
and various risk factors, however, due to its observational 
nature, it will not be able to prove causality. Therefore, 
data points collected have been included with a plausible 
relationship with SSIs. The number of data collection 
points has been kept short in order to maximise data 
completeness and accuracy and minimise investigator 
workload.
Finally, this study will continue to strengthen the 
GlobalSurg network, developing capacity for research 
in LMICs.34 For the many research-naive centres world￾wide, participation in this project could instil a culture 
of clinical effectiveness into routine clinical practice. 
This study will ultimately provide the basis for a global 
multicentre randomised controlled trial, aimed at 
reducing the burden of SSI and its attributed morbidity 
and mortality.
