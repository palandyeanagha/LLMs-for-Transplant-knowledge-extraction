Abstract: The effect of nifedipine and interleukin￾α (IL-1α) on the cell proliferation and DNA synthesis
was studied in human gingival fibroblasts derived from
5 patients who developed gingival overgrowth (nifedipine
responders) and 5 patients who did not develop gingival
overgrowth (nifedipine non-responders) in response
to nifedipine. Epidermal growth factor was used as a
positive control. The fibroblasts derived from nifedipine
responders tended to have a numerically greater rate
of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis (3
H-thymidine
incorporation) than those from nifedipine non￾responders in the presence of nifedipine and IL-1α.
Fibroblasts derived from nifedipine responders showed
significantly higher cell proliferation rate in the presence
of nifedipine and IL-1α, than nifedipine or IL-1α alone
on both the second and the fourth day of incubation
(P < 0.05). A combination of IL-1α and epidermal
growth factor also showed significantly greater cell
proliferation than IL-1α alone on the second day (P <
0.05). The DNA synthesis rate with a combination of
nifedipine and IL-1α was higher than that for nifedipine
alone on the second day (P < 0.01), and IL-1α alone on
the fourth day (P < 0.05) in gingival fibroblasts
originating from nifedipine responders. These results
suggest that the interaction between nifedipine and
gingival inflammation might play an important role in
the pathogenesis of nifedipine-induced gingival
overgrowth. (J. Oral Sci. 47, 105-110, 2005)

Introduction
Nifedipine is being increasingly used in the treatment
of angina pectoris and hypertension and is the most
frequently cited causal agent in calcium channel blocker￾induced gingival overgrowth (1). Fibroblasts derived from
individuals with an enhanced response to nifedipine
(nifedipine responders) exhibit a greater rate of cell
proliferation and DNA synthesis (3H-thymidine
incorporation) than those from nifedipine non-responders
in the presence of 1 µmol/l of calcium channel blockers
or phenytoin (2). Excellent reviews on drug-induced
gingival overgrowth are available (1-4). 
Interleukin-1 (IL-1; IL-1α, IL-1β) has been reported to
be a potential regulator of fibroblast proliferation (5-9),
with significantly higher levels found in gingival crevicular
fluid of patients with periodontal disease (10-17). Using
the Balb/3T3 fibroblast cell line, Kimball et al. (7) reported
that an additive response in terms of cell proliferation
when epidermal growth factor (EGF) is used with IL-1α,
and also that IL-1α is able to induce equivalent levels of
proliferation to IL-1β at lower concentrations, but is more
potent than IL-1β at a higher concentration. Tomura (18)
reported that the growth of human gingival fibroblasts
was maximal in a medium containing 100 pg/ml IL-1α and
500 pg/ml IL-1β. The uronic acid production by gingival
fibroblasts is also enhanced in the presence of IL-1, with
IL-1α having a greater effect than IL-1β (18).
In general, the presence of tooth and gingival crevice
are essential to generate drug-induced gingival overgrowth,
suggesting that the presence of gingival crevicular fluid

might be important for gingival overgrowth. IL-1α
predominates (16) in gingival crevicular fluid and a greater
amount of nifedipine is found in gingival crevicular fluid
in the patients with periodontal disease (19,20). The aim
of this study was thus to investigate the simultaneous
effect of nifedipine and IL-1α on cell proliferation and DNA
synthesis of gingival fibroblasts from nifedipine responders
and non-responders.
Materials and Methods
Cells
Gingival fibroblasts were obtained as described
previously (2,21). Briefly, cultures of fibroblast-like cells
were established from non-inflamed gingival specimens
of 5 patients who had developed gingival overgrowth
(nifedipine responders) and 5 patients who had not
developed gingival overgrowth (nifedipine non-responders)
as a result of nifedipine medication (2,21). All the
specimens were obtained during gingivectomy, clearance
of remaining teeth, or orthopedic surgery of the alveolar
ridge from the patient. Each individual gave written
informed consent for use of their specimens and the
protocol was approved by the Committee on Studies
Involving Human Beings of Nihon University School of
Dentistry at Matsudo. Disappearance or decreased severity
of the overgrowth after discontinuance of nifedipine
medication was regarded as indicating a responsive state.
Isolation and culture of gingival fibroblasts were performed
using methods described by Modéer et al. (22) and Kantor
and Hassell (23) with a slight modification (2,21). The cells
were incubated under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 - 95%
air at 37˚C in a medium of DMEM, supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (FCS), streptomycin 100 µg/ml,
penicillin G 200 U/ml, and amphotericin B 0.2 µg/ml
(DMEM-10). When they had reached a confluent phase,
the cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02%
EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS),
washed with DMEM-10, and then re-plated. Homogeneity
of fibroblasts was determined by flow cytometry (FACS
Vantage, Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan). The fibroblasts
proliferated in the logarithmic phase between the 5th and
the 8th passage, and cells gave a constant proliferation rate
in the presence of nifedipine or phenytoin during the 5th
to the 8th passage.
Cell proliferation assay
The cell proliferation assay was carried out using the
method of Kantor and Hassel (23) with a slight modification
(2,21). Fibroblasts (approximately 3 × 104 cells) in 500
µl of DMEM-10 were allowed to settle in a 24-well plate
(Falcon) for 24 h. Cells were washed with DPBS, and the
medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% FCS
and the same antimicrobial agents as above (DMEM-1)
for 24 h. Cells were again washed and a further 500 µl of
DMEM-10 was added to each well. At this time, 20 µl of
25 µmol/l nifedipine (Sigma Chemical, MO, U.S.A.; final
concentration of 1 µmol/l in 0.025% dimethylsulfoxide,
solution prepared under a sodium vapor lamp and kept in
the dark at 4˚C), 20 µl of 2.5 ng/ml IL-1α (recombinant
human IL-1α, Genzyme, MA, U.S.A.; final concentration
of 100 pg/ml in 0.025% dimethylsulfoxide), or 20 µl of
25 ng/ml EGF (Boehringer Mannheim, Tokyo, Japan;
final concentration of 1 ng/ml in Hank's solution) was
also added. After a 48 or 96 h incubation period, cells were
harvested using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in DPBS,
and counted using a Coulter Counter ZM (Coulter
Electronics, Luton, England). Cells in the absence of drugs
but in the presence of 0.025% dimethylsulfoxide served
as the control. Data were expressed as a mean of five
fibroblastic cell strains obtained from 5 consecutive analysis
of each strain. Statistical analysis was performed by the
one-way ANOVA at the 95% confidence level.
DNA synthesis
Fibroblasts (approximately 6 x 103 cells) in 100 µl of
DMEM-10 were allowed to settle in a 96-well plate
(Falcon) for 24 h. The adherent cells were washed and the
medium was replaced with DMEM-1. Subsequently, 4 µl
of 25 µmol/l nifedipine (final concentration of 1 µmol/l),
4 µl of 2.5 ng/ml of IL-1α (final concentration of 100
pg/ml), or 4 µl of 25 ng/ml of EGF (final concentration of
1 ng/ml) was added as described above and incubated for
48 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM-1 and
nifedipine, IL-1α, and EGF were added to make the same
final concentrations as above. [3
H]-thymidine (22.2 KBq,
Amersham Life Science, Japan) was added to each well
24 h after the last medium change (48 or 96 h incubation
period) and then incorporated into the cell for 24 h. After
treatment using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in DPBS,
cells were harvested with a cell collector (Micromate 196,
Packard Japan, Japan), and the resulting radioactivities on
the disc were measured using a direct beta counter (Matrix
96, Packard Japan, Japan). Radioactivity of the cells in the
absence of drugs (0.025% dimethylsulfoxide that did not
alter the [3
H]-thymidine incorporation) served as a control.
Data were expressed as a mean of 5 strains obtained from
3 consecutive analysis of each strain. Statistical analysis
was performed by the one-way ANOVA at the 95%
confidence level.

Results
Homogeneity and similarity of fibroblasts
Homogeneity of all cell strains used in the present
experiment was assessed using flow cytometry. There was
no specific difference between cells from nifedipine
responders and non-responders in terms of cell size (scatter
forward, SCF), and characteristics of the cell surface
(FCS) or cell substance (scatter side, SSC). The cell
proliferation rate in the presence of nifedipine or phenytoin
did not change from the 3rd to 8th passage.
Cell proliferation 
The simultaneous effect of nifedipine and IL-1α on cell
proliferation rate is summarized in Figs. 1a (2nd day) and
1b (4th day). Although cells from nifedipine responders
tended to have higher proliferation rates, there was no
statistically significant difference between cells from
nifedipine responders and non-responders. On both the 2nd
and 4th day, the cell proliferation rate of fibroblasts
originating from nifedipine responders was significantly
higher in the presence of both nifedipine and IL-1α than
nifedipine or IL-1α alone (P < 0.05). A combination of
IL-1α and EGF also resulted in a significantly higher cell
proliferation rate than IL-1α alone on the 2nd day (P <
0.05). A combination of IL-1α and nifedipine resulted in
the highest cell proliferation rate of all groups tested on
both the 2nd and 4th day. 
DNA synthesis
The simultaneous effect of nifedipine and IL-1α on
DNA synthesis rate, expressed as 3
H-thymidine incorpo￾ration rate, is summarized in Figs. 2a (2nd day) and 2b (4th
day). In fibroblasts originating from nifedipine responders,
a combination of IL-1α and nifedipine resulted in a greater
DNA synthesis rate than nifedipine alone on the 2nd day
(P < 0.01, Fig. 2a), and IL-1α alone on the 4th day (P <
0.05, Fig. 2b). A combination of IL-1α and EGF also
resulted in a higher DNA synthesis rate than IL-1α alone
on the 4th day (P < 0.05, Fig. 2b). In case of gingival
fibroblasts originated from nifedipine non-repsonders, the
same trend was evident. That is, a combination of IL-1α
and nifedipine resulted in a greater DNA synthesis rate than
nifedipine alone on the 2nd and 4th day (P < 0.001, Fig.
2a; P < 0.05, Fig. 2b, respectively) and IL-1α alone on the
2nd day (P < 0.10, Fig. 2a). A combination of IL-1α and
EGF also resulted in a higher DNA synthesis rate than IL￾1α alone on the 4th day (P < 0.05, Fig. 2b). 
Discussion
In the present study, a combination of nifedipine and IL￾1α enhanced cell proliferation and DNA synthesis of
gingival fibroblasts, particularly in the case of those
fibroblasts derived from nifedipine responders. This finding
suggests that inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1, might
play an important role in gingival overgrowth induced by

nifedipine.
IL-1α plays a central role in the gingival inflammatory
process. It has been found at significantly higher levels in
gingival crevicular fluid of patients with periodontal disease
(10-16), and Fujihara (25) reported that the production of
both IL-1α and IL-1β were induced in human peripheral
monocytes stimulated with endotoxin from periodonto￾pathic bacteria. Several studies have also shown that IL￾1 is a potent stimulator of fibroblast proliferation (5,7-
9,26,27), and Inokuchi et al. (28) demonstrated that IL￾1α stimulates cell proliferation through Ca2+/calmodulin￾dependent pathway in NIM 1 cells, a human thyroid cell
line established from a patient with thyroid papillary
adenocarcinoma. The findings of recent papers that the IL￾1 blockers, CK-119 and CK-122 (29) and 1-methyl
hydrazine analogs (30,31) inhibit the cell proliferation in
human lung fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cells,
respectively, also suggest that IL-1 enhances cell growth
in fibroblasts.
Nifedipine is found in significantly higher levels in
gingival crevicular fluid in nifedipine induced-gingival
lesions (18,19), and we have previously demonstrated that
nifedipine stimulates cell proliferation in human gingival
fibroblasts, particularly those from nifedipine responders
(2). 
The presence of both nifedipine and IL-1α in the gingival
tissues is thus likely in patients with gingival inflammation
and receiving nifedipine, and, based on the present findings,
their simultaneous presence could result in enhanced cell
proliferation and DNA synthesis with resultant gingival
overgrowth.
Chemical mediators, such as bradykinin, substance P and
histamine have been demonstrated to enhance the effect
of IL-1α. Kimball et al. (6) reported that bradykinin, at
concentrations between 10-8 and 10-5 mol/l, moderately
promoted [3
H]-TdR incorporation in vitro in the BALB/3T3
cells, and that substance P at approximately 3 × 10-9 to 3
× 10-7 mol/l demonstrated minor proliferative activity.

However, when the cells were cultured with IL-1 plus
substance P or IL-1 plus bradykinin, the ensuing proli￾ferative responses were consistently magnified 2-fold
above the anticipated additive response caused by IL-1 in
combination with either of these neuropeptides. These
chemical mediators might also enhance the effect of
nifedipine 
One limitation of this study is that gingival samples were
taken from different anatomical sites. However, our previous
findings using an animal model (24) demonstrated that
growth of gingival fibroblasts in the presence of nifedipine
or phenytoin did not differ by site. 
In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest
that the presence of IL-1α results in greater cell proliferation
and DNA synthesis than in the presence of nifedipine
alone. While this effect was evident for both nifedipine
responder and non-responder gingival fibroblasts, responder
fibroblasts showed a greater response. These findings
suggest that the interaction between nifedipine and gingival
inflammation might play an important role in the
pathogenesis of nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
