Adipose tissue is no longer considered to be an inert tissue that stores fat. This
tissue is capable of expanding to accommodate increased lipids through hyper￾trophy of existing adipocytes and by initiating differentiation of pre-adipocytes.
Adipose tissue metabolism exerts an impact on whole-body metabolism. As an
endocrine organ, adipose tissue is responsible for the synthesis and secretion
of several hormones. These are active in a range of processes, such as control
of nutritional intake (leptin, angiotensin), control of sensitivity to insulin and
inflammatory process mediators (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6
(IL-6), resistin, visfatin, adiponectin, among others) and pathways (plasminogen
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and acylation stimulating protein (ASP) for example).
This paper reviews some of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of adipose
tissue and its relationship to inflammatory disease and insulin resistance.
Key words: adipose tissue, adipocytes, adipokines.
Adipose tissue
Originally considered as simply a storage organ for triacylglycerol, inter￾est in the biology of adipose tissue has increased substantially. Over the
last decades there has been considerable accumulation of experimental
data about the biology and biochemistry of adipose tissue. This tissue is
no longer considered to be an inert tissue that just stores fat [1]. Adipose
tissue is a metabolically dynamic organ that is the primary site of storage
for excess energy but it serves as an endocrine organ capable of synthe￾sizing a number of biologically active compounds that regulate metabolic
homeostasis. This dynamic tissue is composed not only of adipocytes, but
also of other cell types called the stroma-vascular fraction, comprising
blood cells, endothelial cells, pericytes and adipose precursor cells among
others [2-5]. Several studies have evidenced that adipose tissue is not uni￾form. Depending on the location in the body, they differ in their capacity
to secrete adipocytokines, as well as cellular composition with varied phe￾notype, as well as the quantity and proportion of adipocytes forming it,
blood vessel stromal cells and immune system cells [6]. It is now generally
recognized that adipose tissue is an important organ of a complex network
that participates in the regulation of a variety of quite diverse biological
functions (Figure 1) [7-10].

Adipogenesis refers to the differentiation of pre￾adipocytes into mature fat cells, i.e. the development
of adipose tissue, which varies according to sex and
age. Adipocytes differentiate from stellate or fusiform
precursor cells of mesenchymal origin. The mor￾phological and functional changes that take place
in the course of adipogenesis correspond to a shift
in transcription factor expression and activity lead￾ing from a primitive, multipotent state to a final
phenotype characterized by alterations in cell shape
and lipid accumulation [4, 5].
Pre-adipocytes within adipose tissue can diffe￾rentiate into mature adipocytes throughout life, thus
enabling hyperplastic expansion of adipose tissue
when increased storage requirements are needed.
In addition, the mature adipocytes can expand in size
to accommodate increased storage needs and in
situations of overnutrition become hypertrophic. As
a result, adipocyte number and morphology trans￾form in response to energy balance via the bioche￾mical processes involved in lipid uptake, esterifica￾tion, lipolysis and differentiation of pre-adipocytes [11].
In mammals, there are two types of adipose tis￾sue: white and brown. The adipocytes in these two
types exhibit different morphology and function.
Brown adipose tissue specialized in heat produc￾tion (thermogenesis) is almost absent in adult hu￾mans, but is found at birth. Brown adipocytes, with
an average diameter, are smaller than adipocytes of
white adipose tissue. They have a number of cyto￾plasmic lipid droplets of different sizes, cytoplasm
relatively abundant, a spherical core and slightly
eccentric and numerous mitochondria that release
heat by oxidation of fatty acids. Brown adipose tis￾sue also stores energy in lipid form, but more regu￾larly produces heat by oxidizing fatty acids within
the adipocyte, rather than supplying free fatty acids
for use by other cell types [2, 4, 5]. Brown fat derives
its color from extensive vascularization and the
presence of many densely packed mitochondria. It
is traversed by many more blood vessels than white
fat. These blood vessels assist in delivering fuel for
storage and oxidation, and in dispersing heat gen￾erated by the numerous mitochondria to other
parts of the body [8, 9].
Although its participation in thermogenesis is
irrelevant, white adipose tissue’s functional capac￾ity is much broader and more comprehensive. It has
extensive distribution in the body, involving, or infil￾trating, almost the entire region subcutaneously by
organs and hollow viscera of the abdominal cavity
or mediastinum and several muscle groups, for
which it offers mechanical protection, softening the
impact of shocks and allowing appropriate sliding
of muscle bundles, one on the other, without com￾promising their functional integrity [2, 4]. Because
it is an excellent thermal insulator and has a wide
distribution, including the dermis and subcutaneous
tissue, it plays an important role maintaining body
temperature [5]. By this ability to accumulate and
provide energy when necessary, it assumes the sta￾tus of the most important buffering system for lipid
energy balance, particularly fatty acids, which are
an exceptionally efficient fuel storage species. The
highly reduced hydrocarbon tail can be readily oxi￾dized to produce large quantities of ATP (adenosine
triphosphate) [9].
Lipogenesis and lipolysis
Fat accumulation is determined by the balance be￾tween fat synthesis (lipogenesis) and fat breakdown
(lipolysis/fatty acid oxidation).
Lipogenesis is a process that occurs preferentially
in adipose tissue (Figure 2), but it also happens in
liver, and it is the synthesis of fatty acids, which are
used as energy reserves. This process is responsive
to changes in the diet [12]. It is stimulated by a high
carbohydrate diet leading to elevated postprandial
plasma triglyceride levels, whereas lipogenesis is
inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids and by fast￾ing. Fasting is related to a decrease in plasma glu￾cose and an increase in plasma-free fatty acids.
These effects are partly mediated by hormones,
which inhibit (leptin) or stimulate (angiotensin, acy￾lation stimulating protein) lipogenesis. Glucose itself
is a substrate for lipogenesis. It increases the process
by stimulating the release of insulin and inhibiting
the release of glucagon from the pancreas [12].
Lipolysis occurs in adipose tissue and is the break￾down of fat, in other words, from energy reserves (tri￾glycerides) for energy production by which triacyl￾glycerol molecules are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids
and glycerol (Figure 2). During times of metabolic
stress (i.e. during fasting or prolonged arduous exer￾cise when the body’s energy needs exceed the cir￾culating nutrient levels), the adipocyte’s triacylglyce￾Marisa Coelho, Teresa Oliveira, Ruben Fernandes

rol droplet is degraded to provide free fatty acids to
be used as an energy source by other tissues. Nume￾rous stimuli are able to elicit the lipolytic response
in adipocytes. However, ultimately the same pair of
enzymes, hormone-sensitive lipase and monoacyl￾glycerol lipase, is responsible for catalyzing the hy￾drolysis of the triacylglycerol ester bonds. Complete
hydrolysis of triacylglycerol involves the breakage of
3 ester bonds to release free fatty acids and a glyc￾erol moiety. The same enzyme, hormone-sensitive
lipase, is responsible for facilitating hydrolysis of
the esters at positions 1 and 3 of the triacylglycerol.
A second enzyme, 2-monoacylglycerol lipase, cata￾lyzes hydrolysis of the remaining ester to yield
a third free fatty acid and glycerol. Hormone-sen￾sitive lipase is inhibited by insulin and is favored
by the presence of glucagon and epinephrine [9, 10,
12]. Glycerol is effluxed out of adipocytes via an
aquaporin type of transport molecule and must be
shuttled back to the liver for use in oxidation or glu￾coneogenesis. However, under maximal lipolytic
conditions, substantial recycling of fatty acids
occurs such that on average about two fatty acid
molecules are released per glycerol molecule. Out￾side the adipocyte, fatty acids are immediately bound
to albumin and carried in the bloodstream to the
liver, muscle and other tissues for oxidation [10].
β-Oxidation is a catabolic process in which the free
fatty acids resulting from lipolysis are used by the
body as a source of energy. The fatty acid molecules
are converted into acetyl coenzyme A molecules [2].
Secretory organ
Through the discovery of the ability to secrete
hormones, great importance has been attributed to
the role of adipose tissue [3].
White adipose tissue may represent the largest
endocrine tissue of humans. Its pleiotropic nature
is based on the ability of fat cells to secrete nume￾rous hormones, growth factors, enzymes, cytokines,
complement factors and matrix proteins. Adipose
tissue also expresses receptors for most of these
factors that are implicated in the regulation of many
processes including food intake, energy expendi￾ture, metabolism homeostasis, immunity and blood
pressure homeostasis [7, 13].
Adipose tissue is dynamically involved in cell
function regulation through a complex network of
endocrine (signals travel through the circulatory sys￾tem to reach all parts of the body), paracrine (sig￾nals sent only to cells in the vicinity of the cell sta￾tion), and autocrine (only affecting cells that are the
same type) signals that influence the response of
many tissues, including hypothalamus, pancreas,
liver, skeletal muscle, kidneys, endothelium, and the
immune system, among others. This secretory nature
has prompted the view of white adipose tissue as an
extremely active endocrine tissue [5].
It is commonly assumed that under normal
physiological circumstances adult humans are prac￾tically devoid of functional brown adipose tissue
[14]. However, it has been recently shown that hu￾man white adipose tissue can be infiltrated with
brown adipocytes expressing uncoupling protein 1
(UCP-1). This protein is found in the mitochondria
of brown adipose tissue and it generates heat by
non-shivering thermogenesis.
Experimental data suggest that there are some
differences, in respect to adipokine synthesis and
secretion, between visceral fat and subcutaneous
adipose tissue, as visceral fat appears to be more
active. Both types of this tissue are characterized
by production of a unique profile of adipocytokines.
In the visceral tissue, for example, higher concen￾trations of IL-6 (interleukin-6) and PAI-1 (plasmino￾gen activator inhibitor 1) are observed. In turn, in the
subcutaneous tissue, there is a higher concentra￾tion of leptin and adiponectin [6].
The endocrine activity of white adipose tissue
was postulated when its capacity for steroid hor￾mone interconversion was alluded to. Particularly
since the discovery of leptin, in 1994, the list of adi￾pocyte-derived factors has been increasing at an
extraordinary pace. The discovery of leptin opened
up a whole field of studies into the biology of adi￾pocytes, their metabolic and endocrine functions,
and the functional relationships between secretions
of adipocytes and peripheral metabolic functions.

Figure 2. Primary metabolic role of adipose tissue. In
the feeding state, insulin-dependent glucose trans￾port 4 (GLUT 4) allows the uptake of glucose from the
bloodstream to adipocytes. Glycolysis occurs, produ￾cing glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-3-P), a substrate
required for lipogenesis. Fatty acids from liver carried
by very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomi￾crons from the intestine are esterified with glyce￾rol-3-P to form lipid droplets of triacylglycerols (TAGs).
In the fasting state and in stress conditions, hormone￾sensitive lipase is activated for lipolysis. Some steps
are required to produce glycerol, which travels to the
liver, and fatty acids. These free fatty acids will travel
in the bloodstream to the liver, muscle and to other
organs to be oxidized. In the bloodstream fatty acids

pose-derived factors is by focusing on the function
they perform [4, 5].
The adipose tissue secretes a number of bioac￾tive substances (Figure 3), such as adipocytokines
among others. Unbalanced production of pro- and
anti-inflammatory adipocytokines in obese adipose
tissue may contribute to many aspects of the meta￾bolic syndrome (MetS).
Oversecretion of potentially harmful adipocyto￾kines, such as PAI-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
or visfatin, and hyposecretion of potentially benefi￾cial adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, might be
major mechanisms involved in lifestyle-related di￾seases, including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension and atherosclerosis, comprising the so￾called MetS [15, 16]. The reduction of visceral fat the￾refore might be an essential preventive measure for
MetS and its consequence, cardiovascular disease.
The regulation of key adipocytokines such as adipo￾nectin might be considered as an efficient therapeutic
procedure, but needs to be studied carefully [13].
Obesity is now viewed as a state of systemic,
chronic low-grade inflammation [17]. It has been
recognized by recent studies that obesity (waist cir￾cumference) has a strong impact on adipokine se￾cretion and insulin resistance [18]. More recently it
has been recognized that macrophages are an
important part of the secretory function of adipose
tissue and the main source of inflammatory cytoki￾nes, such as TNF-α and IL-6. As a secretory organ,
adipose tissue presents several particularities and its
secretory activity is regulated by humoral and hor￾monal mechanisms (Table I).
Leptin 
Leptin is a small peptide (16 kDa), considered as
a pre-inflammatory cytokine that indicates com￾mon structural and functional properties, belong￾ing to the IL-6 family of cytokines [17, 19, 20]. The
ob gene expressed by adipocytes encodes it. It is
an anorexigenic peptide that increases energy ex￾penditure, and is primarily cleared from plasma by
the kidney through glomerular filtration followed by
proteolytic degradation in the renal tubules. The lep￾Molecule Function/effect

Biochemistry of adipose tissue: an endocrine organ
tin receptor is expressed not only in the central
nervous system, but also in some peripheral tissues
(hematopoietic and immune cells), suggesting that
leptin may have functions other than food intake
and energy expenditure regulation [17, 19]. Adipose
tissue and plasma leptin concentrations are depen￾dent on the amount of energy stored as fat as well
as the status of energy balance. Therefore, leptin
levels are higher in obese individuals and increase
with overfeeding. Conversely, lean individuals have
lower leptin levels and fasting results in reduction
of circulating leptin. Nutritional regulation of leptin
is mediated at least in part by insulin, as leptin
decreases in response to low insulin levels and
increases with feeding or in response to insulin
stimulation [10].
Leptin is expressed mainly by adipose tissue, alt￾hough low levels have been detected in the placen￾ta, skeletal muscle, gastric and mammary epithelium
and the brain. Leptin is increased by glucocorticoids,
acute infection and proinflammatory cytokines. In
contrast, cold exposure, adrenergic stimulation, growth
hormone (GH), thyroid hormone, melatonin, smo￾king and thiazolidinediones decrease leptin [12, 13].
Its levels are higher in females than males, partly as
a result of inhibition by androgens, stimulation by
estrogen and depot-related differences in leptin ex￾pression. Leptin synthesis is greater in subcutaneous
than in visceral adipose tissue, and the higher cir￾culating concentration of leptin in females is likely
to be due, in part, to a higher proportion of subcuta￾neous fat. Leptin has been implicated in other roles,
including modulation of the reward circuitry for
feeding, glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation, sub￾strate partitioning, and adipocyte apoptosis [17, 19].
Adiponectin
The adiponectin gene on chromosome 3q27 was
described in 1995. From the structural point of view,
adiponectin is related to the complement 1q fami￾ly and contains a carboxyl-terminal globular domain
and an amino-terminal collagenous domain and
also shares extensive sequence homology with col￾lagen VIII and X [21]. Each monomer of adiponectin
is composed of 3 domains: a variable N-terminal
region, an α-helical collagenous ‘stalk’ composed
of multiple G–X–X repeats, and a distinctive C-ter￾minal globular domain of approximately 140 amino
acids [19]. This adipokine circulates in three isoforms:
a trimer, of low-molecular weight (LMW), a hexamer
(trimer-dimer) of medium molecular weight (MMW)
and a multimeric high molecular weight (HMW) iso￾form [22]. Adiponectin exists as a full-length pro￾tein (fAdp) of 30 kDa, which circulates in trimeric,
hexameric and higher order complexes. A fragment
containing the globular domain of adiponectin (gAdp)
has also been shown to exhibit potent metabolic
effects in various tissues. Adiponectin is secreted ex￾clusively from adipose tissue [23]. There is a strong
negative correlation between plasma adiponectin
concentration in humans and fat mass, with the
exception of severe cases of undernutrition and in
the newborn [24]. Adiponectin is associated with
type 2 diabetes (T2D), but is almost exclusively due
to a decrease in levels of the circulating HMW iso￾form, without an accompanying reduction in levels
of the other two oligomeric forms. The distribution
of circulating adiponectin oligomers is thought to
be primarily regulated at the stage of secretion from
adipocytes, since interconversion between the dif￾ferent isoforms does not occur once they have been
released from the cell [24]. In models of genetic and
diet-induced obesity, adiponectin was shown to
improve whole-body insulin sensitivity. Another role
of adiponectin is to stimulate fatty acid oxidation
and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue; this effect is dependent on AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Adiponectin is also
involved in the suppression of hepatic glucose out￾put through activation of AMPK [19].
Two receptors of adiponectin have been identi￾fied: AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. They contain 7 transmem￾brane domains, but differ structurally and func￾tionally. Recent studies have shown that the skeletal
muscle contains abundant levels of both AdipoR1 and
AdipoR2 but the liver primarily expresses AdipoR2.
AdipoR1 works with high affinity with gAdp and low
affinity with fAdp, whereas AdipoR2 works with
intermediate affinity with gAdp and fAdp. The bio￾logical effects of these receptors depend not only on
blood concentrations of adiponectin but also tissue
specificity [17, 25]. Adiponectin displays no great
fluctuations in the bloodstream, which means that
its release is not acute but regulated by long-term
metabolic changes [25]. Adiponectin regulates ener￾gy expenditure through activation of AMPK in the
hypothalamus, where AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 co-loca￾lize with the leptin receptor, ObR [17]. It has been de￾monstrated that adiponectin stimulated appetite
and reduced energy expenditure and that these
effects were eliminated following the ablation of
AdipoR1 (siRNA) or AMPK signaling (AMPK domi￾nant negative) [26].
In contrast to leptin, which has been suggested
to enter the brain via endocytosis through the leptin
receptor, the mechanism by which adiponectin is able
to reach the hypothalamus is unknown. This study
also showed an important finding: adipo–/– mice
show markedly increased leptin sensitivity. This fact
led to the proposal that the central actions of leptin
and adiponectin have reciprocal functions for pro￾viding a homeostatic mechanism to maintain fat
levels and energy stores through the suppression or
stimulation of appetite and energy expenditure [19].
Tumor necrosis factor α

cleavage by a metalloproteinase to be released into
the circulation as a 17 kDa soluble TNF-α molecule [10].
Adipocytes (isolated and differentiated) are capa￾ble of producing TNF-α. For some years it was sug￾gested that adipocytes are the principal source of
elevated TNF-α levels in obesity [21]. Nevertheless,
more recently it has been recognized that adipo￾cytes are not the major source of inflammatory
cytokine but that macrophages from the stromal
vascular fraction are the primary source of adipose
derived TNF-α. Macrophages, which constitute
about 10% of the stromal vascular fraction, are pre￾sent in larger quantities in visceral adipose tissue
than in subcutaneous adipose tissue [6]. These
studies also postulate that the increased levels of
this TNF-α in obesity are due to the increased infil￾tration of adipose tissue with M1 macrophages [21].
Some studies showed that the macrophages are
formed as a result of transformation from mono￾cytes that infiltrated the adipose tissue from the
circulatory system [27]. It was also evidenced that,
both in humans and in mice, the quantity of macro￾phages in the adipose tissue correlates with the fat
mass. It was observed that infiltration of monocytes
from the circulatory system is contributed by adi￾pocytes, which by secreting monocyte chemotactic
protein (MCP-1), macrophage migration inhibition
factor (MIF-1), macrophage inflammatory proteins
(MIP-1α), chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) and macro￾phage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), support
diversification and maturation of monocytes [27, 28].
The first adipose derived factor suggested to rep￾resent a link between obesity, inflammation and
diabetes was TNF-α. Studies show that mRNA ex￾pression levels of TNF-α in adipose tissue in obesity
is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin
resistance; this is because it has been demonstrated
that TNF-α can impair insulin signaling in hepato￾cytes and adipose tissue [29]. Other studies demon￾strated that chronic treatment with TNF-α decrea￾sed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in rat skeletal
muscle, and targeted deletion of TNF-α or its recep￾tors increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tole￾rance in obese rodents in some, but not all, studies
(Figure 4) [19].
TNF-α neutralization in obese T2D humans does
not appear to improve glucose tolerance or insulin
sensitivity. However, in individuals without establi￾Figure 4. The expansion of adipose tissue leads to adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity. The release of chemokines that
induce recruitment of macrophages from the bloodstream increases infiltration and inflammation with enhanced pro￾duction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-6. This is accomplished by
increased release of FFA and dysregulated secretion of leptin, adiponectin and resistin. The macrophage and adipose
tissue-derived adipokines acts in a paracrine or autocrine way, which exacerbates adipose tissue inflammation. Altered
adipokine secretion, at the systemic level, can lead to decreased muscle and liver insulin sensitivity through enhanced
ectopic lipid deposition and inflammation. These effects lead to increased liver glucose production (by means of glu￾coneogenesis and glycogenolysis). In contrast, muscle metabolism is reshuffled to a pattern of low glucose uptake
and low FFA oxidation (with increases in levels of glycerol substrate for liver gluconeogenesis). These events lead to
an increase of plasma glucose and, subsequently, an increase of insulin resistance. Adapted from: Galic S et al., 2010

Biochemistry of adipose tissue: an endocrine organ
shed T2D, prolonged treatment does improve insu￾lin sensitivity [19]. The molecular mechanism for
this observed impairment in insulin action involves
inhibition of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) sig￾naling capability through the activation of serine
kinases such as the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)
or inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) and through
increased expression of suppressor of cytokine sig￾naling 3 (SOCS3). In hepatocytes TNF-α also reduces
fatty acid oxidation and skeletal muscle through
effects mediated by the induction of protein phos￾phatase 2C and suppression of AMPK. The reduced
rates of fatty acid oxidation are accompanied by
increased accumulation of bioactive lipids, such as
diacylglycerols, which in turn are known to activate
protein kinase C and inhibit IRS function [19]. In
addition, TNF-α induces pro-apoptotic and/or death
signals in a variety of cell types. It is therefore inter￾esting to speculate that hypertrophied adipocytes,
which are stimulated by macrophage-derived TNF-α,
can release saturated fatty acids as an endogen
danger signal that report their diseased state to
macrophages in obese adipose tissue. Indeed, sev￾eral lines of evidence indicate that adipocyte death
and/or the death receptor Fas signaling contribute
to the obesity-induced adipose tissue, particularly
during periods of starvation, but recent evidence
has suggested pathophysiological roles other than
the supply of nutrients in times of fasting or
increased demand. In this regard free fatty acids,
when released physiologically during fasting or star￾vation via adipocyte lipolysis, may not act as a dan￾ger signal [30].
Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
In humans, approximately 30% of circulating IL-6
originates from adipose tissue. Concentrations are
higher in visceral fat as compared to subcutaneous
fat. They increase with obesity and are stimulated
by TNF and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Elevated levels are
associated with increased risk of coronary artery
disease, atherosclerosis, and unstable angina [31].
In T2D plasma IL-6 levels are increased and are
positively correlated with body mass and plasma
free fatty acid concentrations. As with TNF-α, the
largest amount of IL-6 is derived from cells of the stro￾mal vascular fractions, while the other part, appro￾ximately 1/3, of IL-6 detected in plasma is attribu￾ted to the production from white adipose tissue [2,
19]. It has been demonstrated that IL-6 inhibits the
insulin signaling pathway by up-regulating SOCS3
expression, which in turn is known to impair in￾sulin-induced insulin receptor and IRS-1 phospho￾rylation in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Moreover,
IL-6 can promote fatty acid oxidation and glucose
uptake in skeletal muscle findings, which are also
observed with the IL-6 family member ciliary neu￾rotrophic factor (CNTF) [32, 33]. Some studies have
demonstrated that these effects require activation
of AMPK-activated protein kinase but this mecha￾nism is not understood [32]. In general, IL-6 inhibits
lipase lipoprotein, induces lipolysis and increases
glucose uptake [19].
Angiotensin
Adipose tissue expresses all components of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), inclu￾ding angiotensinogen (AGT), renin, angiotensin I-con￾verting enzyme, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor [3].
Moreover, adipose tissue angiotensinogen mRNA and
protein levels are regulated by nutrition, leading to
decreased levels with fasting and to increased le￾vels with refeeding. Angiotensin II stimulates prosta￾cyclin synthesis, adipocyte differentiation and lipo￾genesis. Based on these findings, it is suggested that
adipose tissue-derived angiotensin may regulate
adipocyte differentiation and growth, as is the case
in other tissues. It is also possible that RAAS pepti￾des secreted by adipose tissue act on the vasculature
and distant targets to regulate blood pressure and
cardiovascular responses in obese individuals [32].
Angiotensin II also has a recognized effect on
cardiovascular function such as hypertension and
hemostasis. Human platelets express angiotensin II
receptors AT1 [34]. Some studies have described the
role of angiotensin II on hemostasis. It has been
demonstrated that angiotensin II can induce and
potentiate shape change in human platelets [35].
Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) 
Another factor involved in microvascular events
is the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1).The
gene for PAI-1 is located on chromosome 7q21.3- q22.
PAI-1 is a single chain 45-kDa glycoprotein that con￾tains from 379 to 381 amino acids. Endothelial and
vascular smooth muscle cells are presumably the
main sources of PAI-1 but other cells, such as plate￾lets, hepatocytes, mesangial cells, fibroblasts, mono￾cytes, macrophages, adipocytes, and stromal cells per￾meating the adipose tissue, have also been shown
to secrete the serpin [36].
The greater the fat cell size and the adipose tissue
mass, the greater is the contribution of adipose pro￾duction to circulating PAI-1. Experimental data show
that visceral adipose tissue has a higher capacity
to produce PAI-1 than subcutaneous adipose tissue.
Studies in human adipocytes indicate that PAI-1 syn￾thesis is upregulated by insulin, glucocorticoids,
angiotensin II, some fatty acids and, most potent￾ly, by cytokines such as TNF-α and transforming
growth factor-β, whereas catecholamines reduce
PAI-1 production [36, 37].
The PAI-1 is a protein involved in fibrinolysis and
is altered in obesity [38]. Plasma PAI-1 levels increase
in proportion to visceral adiposity, raising the pos￾sibility that PAI-1 serves as the link between abdo-

minal/central obesity and cardiovascular disease.
That protein can change the balance between fib￾rinolysis and fibrinogenesis, contributing to the re￾modeling of vascular architecture and the athero￾sclerotic process [39]. An altered function of the
endocrine system and an impaired auto-/paracrine
function at the fat cell levels may mediate this dis￾turbance of the fibrinolytic system and thereby
increase the risk for cardiovascular disease [37].
Acylation stimulating protein (ASP)
The ASP is produced through a two-step process
involving three proteins of the alternate comple￾ment system: C3, factor B and adipsin, all of which
are synthesized and secreted by adipocytes [40].
It has an important effect on the increase of lipo￾genesis by the translocation of glucose transporter
type 4 (GLUT4) in glycerol 3-phosphate and the
activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), an
enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of triglycerides [40,
41]. Plasma ASP increases with meals and facilitates
the synthesis and storage of triglycerides. Consis￾tent with its role as a mediator of lipogenesis, ASP
deficiency increases postprandial fatty acid levels
and decreases weight gain and triglyceride syn￾thesis [39].
In humans, ASP levels are increased in obesity, T2D,
and cardiovascular disease, whereas exercise or weight
loss decreases ASP levels. Postprandially, subcuta￾neous adipose tissue increases production of ASP,
and this has been shown to correlate with local fatty
acid trapping. Furthermore, similar to insulin resis￾tance, a deleterious ASP-resistant state has been pro￾posed to also contribute to the disturbed adipose
tissue metabolism and dyslipidemia common to
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The ASP levels
curiously are also reduced with age, a phenomenon
observed previously in humans, with children tend￾ing to have higher ASP values than adults [41, 42].
Resistin 
Resistin, discovered in 2001, is a small peptide
(12.5 kDa) synthesized as a peptide with 108 amino
acids, containing high quantities of cysteine [19, 20].
The structure of resistin is strikingly similar to that
of adiponectin [43]. Resistin is secreted not only by
adipocytes, but also by a large number of cells, in
particular immunocompetent cells.
Circulating resistin levels are increased in mouse
models of obesity and in obese humans and are
decreased by the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone,
and increased in diet-induced and genetic forms of
obesity, and administration of anti-resistin antibody
has been shown to improve blood sugar and insulin
action in mice with diet-induced obesity [44, 45].
Similarly, resistin has been implicated in the pathoge￾nesis of diabetic complications and diabetes [45, 46].
In vitro studies evidenced that macrophage stim￾ulation with lipopolysaccharide or pro-inflammatory
cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) leads to considerable
increase in resistin production during infection [20].
Release of resistin appears to be stimulated by in￾flammation, LPS (lipopolysaccharide), IL-6, hypergly￾cemia, growth and gonadal hormones. While released
within the fat tissue resistin acts on adipocytes them￾selves, leading to insulin resistance [45].
Effects of the administration and neutralization
of resistin in glucose tolerance in tissues indicate that
its action is through the negative modulation of one
or more steps of insulin signaling aimed at increas￾ing glucose uptake [44]. In addition, it promotes in￾sulin resistance by increasing hepatic gluconeoge￾nesis. It was also observed that the expression is
about 3 times higher in pre-adipocytes compared
to mature adipocytes, indicating that it is a poten￾tial regulator of adipogenesis [44, 47].
Resistin also stimulates endothelial cells to secrete
such substances as monocyte chemoattractant pro￾tein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
(VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1
(ICAM-1), which is indicated to be an adiponectin an￾tagonist [27].
Visfatin 
Visfatin is a highly conserved 52 kDa protein
prevalent in visceral adipose tissue. It is also known
as pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), is prin￾cipally produced by adipocytes, although also by
macrophages of the visceral adipose tissue, and in
small quantities by subcutaneous adipose tissue.
Visfatin mRNA expression significantly increases
during differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes
[48, 49].
It was shown that visfatin’s major function is re￾lated to energy metabolism and innate immunity and
it is now regarded as a pro-inflammatory adipocy￾tokine. Its properties induce activation of leukocytes
and stimulate production of TNF-α and IL-6 [49, 50].
Inside cells visfatin acts as a nicotinamide phos￾phoribosyltransferase involved in the salvage path￾way of NAD+ biosynthesis. Thus, it is able to regulate
cellular levels of NAD+
, exerting an influence on cell
energy metabolism and the activity of NAD+
/NADH
dependent enzymes [39].
Recent studies demonstrated that visfatin exerted
insulin mimetic effects in cultured adipocytes, myo￾cytes, and hepatocytes and lowered plasma glu￾cose levels in mice by binding to and activating the
insulin receptor [51].
Conclusions
Adipose tissue is the primary storage site for ex￾cess energy but it is also recognized as an endocrine
organ. Adipocytes are now generally accepted to be
a complex cell type involved in generating a num￾ber of signals which include cytokines, hormones
and growth factors that not only affect the neigh￾Marisa Coelho, Teresa Oliveira, Ruben Fernandes

Biochemistry of adipose tissue: an endocrine organ
boring cells but also impact target tissues involved
in energy metabolism and influencing physiologic
and pathologic processes. Much of the research in
this area has focused on leptin and adiponectin, the
two prototypic adipokines, which show beneficial
effects on insulin action and lipid metabolism. Obe￾sity is characterized by increases in fat cell number,
fat cell size, or a combination of the two. More re￾cently, there is evidence that low-grade inflammation
within the adipose tissue results in the dysregula￾tion of adipocytokine production, thereby contri￾buting to the pathophysiology of MetS. In the obese
state, the adipose tissue is infiltrated by inflamed
macrophages that release TNF-α and IL-6, thus link￾ing obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. It
is increasingly important to understand the signaling
pathways by which adipokines control metabolism
and to try to discover new therapies for diseases rela￾ted to adipose tissue.
