Introduction
Many studies have described different conditioning regi￾mens and different types of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
prophylaxis in patients undergoing reduced intensity (RIC)
and non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
1-8
One of the most widely used approaches is based on the
combination of cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF), which was initially developed by the Seattle
group in the non-myeloablative transplant setting. Various
studies have reported overall survival rates at 3-5 years in the
range of 43-64% among patients who did not have advanced
disease at the time of transplantation, with incidences of
grades 2-4 acute and overall chronic GVHD of 11-63% and
44-90%, respectively.
9-13 In our experience of using CsA-MMF
as GVHD prophylaxis after RIC based on fludarabine plus
busulphan or melphalan, the incidences of grades 2-4 acute
GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD were 53% and 93%,
respectively, in a series of patients receiving allogeneic stem
cell transplants from unrelated donors.
3
A more recent immunoprophylactic strategy consists of the
combination of sirolimus plus tacrolimus (Si-Tac), which was
mostly abandoned in the setting of myeloablative condition￾ing because of a high incidence of associated veno-occlusive
disease and microangiopathy,
14 although it gives promising
results in the RIC setting. In this regard, overall survival rates
of 62-72% at 1-3 years have been reported, with the inci￾dence of grades 2-4 acute GVHD being 14-43% and that of
chronic GVHD being 46-63%.
6,15-18 Unfortunately, we lack
data from multicenter trials using this approach and these
results have not been confirmed by other groups. For exam￾ple, Furlong et al.
19 described a high incidence of toxicity,
which led to 42% of patients withdrawing from the trial,
with a high incidence of acute GVHD (77%).
Against this background, the primary objective of the cur￾rent study was to evaluate the incidence of GVHD after RIC

Different types of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis have been proposed in the setting of reduced intensity and
non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. An alternative combination with sirolimus and tacrolimus
has recently been tested although comparative studies against the classical combination of a calcineurin inhibitor
and mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate are lacking. We describe the results of a prospective, multicenter trial
using sirolimus + tacrolimus as immunoprophylaxis, and compare this approach with our previous experience
using cyclosporine + mycophenolate in the setting of unrelated donor transplantation setting after reduced-inten￾sity conditioning. Forty-five patients received cyclosporine + mycophenolate between 2002 and mid-2007, while
the subsequent 50 patients, who were transplanted from late 2007, were given sirolimus + tacrolimus. No signif￾icant differences were observed in terms of hematopoietic recovery or acute graft-versus-host disease overall,
although gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease grade ≥2 was more common in the cyclosporine +
mycophenolate group (55% versus 21%, respectively, P=0.003). The 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft￾versus-host disease was 50% versus 90% for the patients treated with the sirolimus- versus cyclosporine-based reg￾imen, respectively (P<0.001), while the incidence of extensive chronic disease was 27% versus 49%, respectively
(P=0.043). The 2-year non-relapse mortality rate was 18% versus 38% for patients receiving the sirolimus- versus
the cyclosporine-based regimen, respectively (P=0.02). The event-free survival and overall survival at 2 years were
53% versus 29% (P=0.028) and 70% versus 45% (P=0.018) among patients receiving the sirolimus- versus the
cyclosporine-based regimen, respectively. In conclusion, in the setting of reduced intensity transplantation from an
unrelated donor, promising results can be achieved with the combination of sirolimus + tacrolimus, due to a lower
risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease and non-relapse mortality, which translates into better event-free and over￾all survival rates, in comparison with those achieved with cyclosporine + mycophenolate. This trial was registered
at www.clinicaltrials.gov as 2007-006416-32 by GEL-TAMO/GETH.
The combination of sirolimus plus tacrolimus improves outcome after
reduced-intensity conditioning, unrelated donor hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation compared with cyclosporine plus mycofenolate

ABSTRACT

allogeneic transplantation from unrelated donors using a
modified Si-Tac combination as GVHD prophylaxis, in a
prospective multicenter trial started in 2007 (2007-006416-
32 trial by GEL-TAMO/GETH). The results of this trial
were compared with those from a previous trial in which
patients, enrolled between 2002 and 2007, received the
same RIC protocols, but were given CsA-MMF as GVHD
prophylaxis (TNE-ANM 2001 from GETH).
3 A compara￾tive analysis of the overall outcomes from the two trials
was a secondary objective of the current study.
Design and Methods
Patients’ characteristics
From February 2007 to August 2010, 50 patients were included
in the Si-Tac prospective multicenter trial. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committees at each center, and each
patient provided written, informed consent to participation after a
detailed explanation in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. The patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. The
median age at the time of transplantation was 50 years (range, 23
to 64 years). Forty-eight per cent of the patients were in first or
subsequent complete remission from their underlying disease,
30% showed a partial response, while 22% had active or progres￾sive disease at the time of transplantation. Forty-four per cent of
the patients had received a prior transplant at the time of their
inclusion in the trial. The source of progenitor cells was peripheral
blood in 90% of the patients, and 35% received stem cells from an
HLA allele-mismatched donor (five cases had one, and three cases
had two allele mismatches at HLA A, B, C and DRB1).
Compared with the 50 newly recruited patients, the 45 patients
who received CsA-MMF as GVHD prophylaxis were significantly
younger (P=0.005), and peripheral blood stem cells were used in
55% of cases (P<0.001). No other differences were found between
the two subgroups (Table 1). More than 90% of the pairs (either
the donor or recipient) in both subgroups were cytomegalovirus
seropositive.
Conditioning regimen and graft-versus-host disease
prophylaxis
Two RIC regimens were used, one that is recommended for
lymphoid malignancies and the other for myeloid malignancies.
The lymphoid RIC regimen consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m2
administered intravenously on days -9 to -5, followed by melpha￾lan 70 mg/m2 intravenously on days -3 and -2. The myeloid regi￾men consisted of the same doses of fludarabine together with oral
busulphan 1 mg/kg for 10 doses (days -6 to -4, total 10 mg/kg),
with phenytoin given as anticonvulsant prophylaxis.
20-22
Hematopoietic stem cells from an unrelated donor were infused
on day 0.
Patients transplanted from 2007 were included in the 2007-
006416-32 GEL-TAMO/GETH trial and received GVHD prophy￾laxis consisting of sirolimus at a dose of 6 mg/day p.o. on day –6,
followed by 4 mg/day p.o. from day –5; tacrolimus was started on
day –3 at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg/day as a continuous i.v. infusion.
Levels of both drugs were monitored from day –1 and doses were
adjusted for target blood levels of 5-10 ng/mL for sirolimus and 5-
10 ng/mL for tacrolimus. Drug levels were assessed onsite using
immunoassays. In the absence of acute GVHD, we planned to
taper the dose of tacrolimus by 5% each week starting on day +56
and stopping on day +180, and to taper the dose of sirolimus from
day +180, stopping this on day +240.
Patients transplanted from 2002 to 2006 were included in the
TNE-ANM 2001 trial; in this subset GVHD prophylaxis consisted
of CsA plus MMF, as previously described.
3 CsA was given at a
dose of 1 mg/kg/day intravenously from days –7 to –2, and then 3
mg/kg/day intravenously or orally from day –1. Levels were main￾tained in the therapeutic range until tapering. MMF was given
orally at a dose of 1 g every 8-12 h or intravenously at a dose of 15
mg/kg every 8-12 h. The dose was planned to be tapered starting
on day +56 and stopping on day +100, although MMF was
stopped as scheduled in only 10 of the 45 patients, while the
remaining patients received this drug beyond day +100.
Antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis was given
according to each institution’s standard practice, with no differ￾ences between the two groups, except for the use of antifungal
prophylaxis with triazols, which were not allowed for patients
receiving Si-Tac per protocol because of the strong interactions
between these drugs. Neither granulocyte colony-stimulating fac￾tor nor heparin prophylaxis was used.
Acute and chronic GVHD were graded by pre-defined crite￾ria.
23,24 In order to establish the diagnosis, all patients had biopsies
of at least one of the organs involved. Since MMF can induce gas￾trointestinal toxicity, suspected cases of gastrointestinal GVHD
had to be proven histologically. A clinical diagnosis of post-trans￾plant thrombotic microangiopathy was established according to
previously defined international criteria.
25
Statistical analysis
Eight end-points were considered: acute GVHD grades 2-4 and
3-4, chronic GVHD, extensive chronic GVHD, relapse, non￾relapse mortality, overall survival and event-free survival. Acute
GVHD, chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality and relapse were
analyzed and compared using the Gray test.
26 The cumulative inci￾dence was computed with the cmprsk package for R 2.14.0 soft￾ware (R Development Core Team (2011); http://www.R-project.org/).
Competing events were defined as follows. In the case of acute
GVHD, chronic GVHD and relapse the competing event was
death without the occurrence of the event of interest. For non￾Sirolimus + tacrolimus after RIC URD transplant

relapse mortality the competing event was relapse. Relapse was
also considered as a competing event for GVHD. Overall survival
and event-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method, and groups were compared with the log-rank test using
SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Events were calculated from the time of transplantation as fol￾lows. Non-relapse mortality was defined as death from any cause
(GHVD-related or other cause), without prior relapse or progres￾sion of the underlying disease. The relapse incidence was ana￾lyzed from the time of transplantation until the time of relapse in
those patients in remission before or after the transplant. Event￾free survival was calculated from transplantation until disease pro￾gression or death, and those patients who did not achieve a dis￾ease response (complete or partial remission) any time after trans￾plantation were considered as having had events on day 100, since
this was the earliest date for complete disease evaluation. Overall
survival was calculated from transplantation until death from any
cause, and surviving patients were censored at their last follow-up.
Patients who showed evidence of engraftment could be evaluated
for acute GVHD, whereas patients who engrafted and survived
more than 100 days could be evaluated for chronic GVHD. For
both acute GVHD and chronic GVHD, the day of onset was ana￾lyzed as the time to event in evaluable patients.
Multivariate Cox regression was performed in SPSS to control
for the effects of GVHD prophylaxis treatment and other prognos￾tic factors, such as age, HLA disparity and status at transplanta￾tion, as well as the date of inclusion during the recruitment period.
The proportional hazard assumption was tested for each variable
analytically and graphically. Overall survival, event-free survival,
non-relapse mortality and Cox regression models were compared
with and without censoring the first cohort (CsA-MMF) at the
longest follow-up of the second cohort (Si-Tac) in order to rule out
the possibility of any bias related to differences in the median fol￾low-up of the two subgroups.
Differences were considered to be statistically significant for
two sided P-values <0.05.
Results
Regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease
Patients receiving Si-Tac reached blood counts of
>1,000/mm3 granulocytes and >50,000 platelets/mm3 at a
median of 20 and 25 days after transplantation, respective￾ly. As far as regards non-hematologic toxicity, the regimen
was well tolerated, with only six patients developing
>grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity and one patient experi￾encing neurological toxicity. These data are summarized
in Table 2. Five patients developed reversible thrombotic
microangiopathy, and there were no cases of veno-occlu￾sive disease. Interestingly, four of the five patients with
thrombotic microangiopathy received fluconazole as anti￾fungal prophylaxis.
The incidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation was
26%, while 8% of patients developed a probable invasive
fungal infection.
The 100-day cumulative incidences of grades 2-4 and 3-
4 acute GVHD were 49% (95% CI 42-70%) and 16%
(95% CI 7-28 %), among patients receiving Si-Tac versus
45% (95% CI 30-59%) and 20% (95% CI 10-33%) among
patients receiving CsA-MMF in the previous trial (P=0.5
for both comparisons) (Figure 1). The median day of onset
of acute GVHD was 31 days (range, 5-92 days) after trans￾plantation versus 33 days (range, 2-103 days), respectively.
The incidence of gastrointestinal acute GVHD ≥grade 2
was 21% (95% CI 11-39) in Si-Tac patients, compared
with 55% (95% CI 38-72) in the CsA-MMF cohort
(P=0.007). Moreover, 83% of patients receiving Si-Tac
achieved complete remission after first-line treatment
with steroids, compared with 56% of patients receiving
CsA-MMF, while 10% and 7% had a partial response and
no response, respectively, in the Si-Tac groups versus 24%
and 20% in the CsA-MMF group (P=0.08). Chronic
GVHD occurred at a median of 211 days (range, 84-487
days) after transplantation, compared with 184 days
(range, 51-1057) in the CsA-MMF group. The 1-year
cumulative incidence of overall and extensive chronic
GVHD was 50% (95% CI 34-64%) and 27% (95% CI 14-
41%), respectively, while these values were 90% (95% CI
69-97%) and 49% (95% CI 27-67%), respectively, for
patients in the CsA-MMF cohort (P<0.001 for overall and
P=0.043 for extensive chronic GVHD; Figure 2). The type
of onset of chronic GVHD was de novo, quiescent and pro￾gressive in 75%, 6% and 19% of the patients in the Si-Tac
trial, compared with 34%, 33% and 33% in patients treat￾ed with CsA-MMF, respectively (P=0.023). Finally, accord￾ing to the National Institutes of Health score system, 48%,
39% and 13% patients were categorized as having mild,
moderate and severe chronic GVHD, respectively, in the
Si-Tac group, compared with 23%, 36% and 41%, respec￾tively, among patients receiving CsA-MMF (P=0.025).
Although it was planned that MMF would be withdrawn
faster than sirolimus, this was not actually possible
because of this higher incidence of chronic GVHD among
patients in the CsA-MMF group. In this regard, comparing
exposure to any systemic immunosuppressive drug, no
differences were found between the two subgroups up to
2 years post-transplantation: 38% versus 35% of patients
were off immunosuppression at 2 years among those
receiving Si-Tac and CsA-MMF, respectively.
Figure 3 shows the performance status at 3, 6, 9 and 12
months post-transplant among patients included in the Si￾Tac group. As shown, most evaluable patients (>90%) had
a good performance status (ECOG=0 or 1) at these times,
with improvement during the first year of follow-up.
Disease response and outcome
The 2-year incidence of disease relapse in the Si-Tac and
CsA-MMF groups was 18% (95% CI: 4-39%) versus 29%

the 2-year non-relapse mortality was 18% (95% CI: 8-31%)
versus 38% (95% CI: 24-52%), respectively (P=0.02) (Figure

Table 3. After a mean follow-up of 504 days (95-898)
among surviving patients receiving Si-Tac, the estimated 2-

In multivariate analysis of overall survival, neither age
(HR=1.02, 95% CI: 0.98-1.05; P=0.208), HLA mismatch
(HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.31-1.47; P=0.332) or disease status at
transplant (HR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.44-2.30; P=0.971) for
active disease influenced the outcome. Most importantly,
the year of transplantation during the recruitment period
did not influence the outcome (HR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.74-
1.32; P=0.974). In this regard, no change in the risk pattern
before or after the introduction of Si-Tac was observed
(HR=1, 95% CI: 0.12-8.39; P=0.998). Only the type of
GVHD prophylaxis (Si-Tac versus CsA-MMF) had a signif￾icant association with outcome in the multivariate analy￾sis (HR= 2.62, 95% CI: 1.26-5.42; P=0.009).
Finally, overall survival, non-relapse mortality, event￾free survival and relapse rate did not differ when the fol￾low-up of the patients receiving CsA-MMF was censored
at the time of the longest follow-up among those receiving
Sic-Tac (898 days). In fact, no events (deaths or relapses)
occurred after 898 days in the first cohort of patients.
Discussion
The lack of comparative studies to identify the best
approach for GVHD prophylaxis explains the absence of
consensus and the large number of strategies used within
the RIC setting.
27,28 The current study is the first to evalu￾ate the use of sirolimus plus tacrolimus without
methotrexate among patients undergoing RIC allogeneic
transplantation from an unrelated donor in a multicenter
trial. Using this approach, the addition of low-dose
methotrexate was not shown to have a clear benefit to
overall outcomes in previous studies and, furthermore, it
can result in delayed engraftment and greater than expect￾ed transplant-related toxicity (mainly causing renal dys￾function).
8,15,18,19 We confirmed the previous findings from
single-institution studies concerning toxicity, GVHD,
overall survival and event-free survival.
16-18,29-32 Considering
the characteristics of the patients included in this trial
(median age of 50 years; 52% with measurable or active
disease at the time of transplantation) and of the donors
(35% had at least one HLA mismatch), our results with
respect to overall and event-free survival are very promis￾ing. Thus, like the findings reported by the Dana Farber’s
group,
15 we found a low toxicity profile with a small num￾ber of patients displaying thrombotic microangiopathy,
and no patients developing sinusoidal obstruction syn￾drome. In fact, all but one of the patients developing
thrombotic microangiopathy received -azoles as antifun￾gal prophylaxis, which was not allowed per protocol. This
is in contrast to previous reports that described the use of
Si-Tac in the myeloablative setting, and other studies in
the non-myeloablative setting that found a high incidence
of toxicity, leading to protocol withdrawal in a significant
proportion of patients.
19,29-31 It is worth mentioning that
drug levels were measured onsite using immunoassays,
rather than by high performance liquid chromatography.
Remarkably, levels of toxicity and GVHD incidence were
similar to those reported by Cutler et al.
15
In the current study we used a lower loading dose of
sirolimus, which was started on day –6 instead of day –3,
as had previously been done.
6,14,18,32 This schedule was
planned in an attempt to obtain therapeutic levels before
day +1 without increasing the toxicity profile.
Interestingly, it was not associated with increased toxicity
during the conditioning regimen and, considering the sim￾ilar incidence of acute and chronic GVHD to those in pre￾vious studies in which sirolimus was started on day –3,

both approaches appear to have similar efficacy.
The combination of CsA and MMF as GVHD prophy￾laxis is widely used in the RIC setting in many centers,
33,34
based on the initial non-myeloablative protocol designed
by the Seattle consortium.
12 In the RIC setting, however, a
high incidence of chronic GVHD has been observed in
several studies,
10,35,36 including our previous trial of unrelat￾ed donor transplantation,
3 in which there was an inci￾dence of extensive chronic GVHD of around 50% and a
median duration of immunosuppressive treatment of 25
months. The current comparison of Si-Tac and CsA-MMF
is not based on a randomized trial. However, the data
emerge from two consecutive clinical trials with no differ￾ences in the RIC procedure or the supportive care other
than the GVHD prophylaxis itself. Moreover, as far as the
patients’ characteristics are concerned, the only differ￾ences between the two subgroups would favor a higher
mortality among the Si-Tac patients (higher median age)
and a greater incidence of extensive chronic GVHD (high￾er proportion of transplants with peripheral blood as the
source of stem cells).
Although the differences in acute GVHD were not sta￾tistically significant, it is worth mentioning the higher
response rate for acute GVHD within the Si-Tac subgroup
after first-line therapy. It is also noteworthy that, in this
trial, the evaluation of patients’ performance status was
systematically documented. Such data have seldom been
reported in previous studies.
16 The favorable ECOG per￾formance status reported after 1 year of transplantation
(ECOG=0-1 in more than 90% of evaluable patients), the
low incidence of CMV infection, the small number of
invasive fungal infections observed and the low rate of
infection-related mortality (6% at 2 years post-transplant)
in the Si-Tac group can be attributed to the lower inci￾dence of chronic GVHD. Remarkably, sirolimus has direct
antineoplastic, antifungal and anti-cytomegalovirus activi￾ties with possible clinical implications, as recently suggest￾ed in two large studies by Marty et al.
36 and Armand et al.
38
In the current comparison, the lower incidence of GVHD
in the Si-Tac group was not associated with a lower
response or a higher relapse rate compared with that in
patients receiving CsA-MMF. Considering that both sub￾groups received the same RIC, these data indicate that
sirolimus allows the reduction of GVHD without hamper￾ing the efficacy of the procedure. Furthermore, the lower
incidence of complications translates into a better survival.
In conclusion, the current multicenter trial reveals prom￾ising outcomes for patients undergoing RIC allogeneic
transplantation from an unrelated donor using sirolimus
and tacrolimus as GVHD prophylaxis, without in vivo T￾cell depletion. Compared with CsA-MMF, Si-Tac led to a
lower incidence of chronic GVHD and a lower rate of non￾relapse mortality, which translate into better survival.
