Abstract
One hundred and five hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) positive patients presenting
with chronic persistent hepatitis (n=46) or
chronic active hepatitis without cirrhosis
(n= 59) were followed longitudinally for one to
16 years (mean 5.5 years) and underwent
follow up biopsy. During a mean histological
follow up of 3*7 years, active cirrhosis
developed in 21 (20%) patients one to 13 years
after entry to the study with a calculated annual
incidence of 5.9%/o. The probability of evolu￾tion to cirrhosis was significantly higher in
patients with chronic active hepatitis and
bridging hepatic necrosis than in those with
moderate chronic active hepatitis or chronic
persistent hepatitis (p<0*0001). Cox multiple
regression analysis showed that the following
three variables independently implied poor
prognosis: older age, presence of bridging
hepatic necrosis, and persistence of hepatitis B
virus DNA in serum (p<0-0001). These find￾ings indicate that patients with severe chronic
active hepatitis and persistent hepatitis B virus
replication are at very high risk of rapid pro￾gression to cirrhosis.

Previous studies have clearly documented the
progression of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infec￾tion to cirrhosis. 1' There have been authors' who
provided evidence supporting the hypothesis
that chronic HBV infection is progressive in
nature, but other studies have shown that spon￾taneous remission of the chronic liver disease
may occur, particularly in those patients with
permanent termination of HBV replication.59 It
would be of great clinical importance to identify
factors that predict the progression to cirrhosis,
particularly in the light of therapeutic decisions
and the use of antiviral agents in chronic HBV.
Previous studies, often conducted on hetero￾geneous series of patients, have suggested that
some clinical, virological, and histological
features may be helpful in this context, but
statistically significant data are lacking.""2 We
have analysed the clinical and histological out￾come of a large series of patients who presented
with chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis and
were followed up for a very long period (up to 16
years). The evaluation of prognostic factors
based on multivariate analysis is also reported.
Methods
One hundred and five consecutive HBsAg posi￾tive patients with chronic hepatitis who fulfilled
the following criteria at presentation were con￾sidered for the study: (1) HBsAg positivity and
persistently high serum alanine aminotransferase
(normal <55 IU/1) lasting for at least 12 months;
(2) negative for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)
markers; (3) a liver biopsy specimen consistent
with the diagnosis of chronic persistent or of
chronic active hepatitis without histological and
clinical (wasting, oesophageal varices, ascites)
evidence of cirrhosis; (4) follow up period of at
least 12 months from histological diagnosis; (5) a
follow up liver biopsy taken during the observa￾tion period.
Patients with an alcohol intake greater than
80 g/day and those taking drugs that might be
possible aetiological agents were excluded from
this study. Parenteral drug addicts were also
excluded from evaluation.
Of the 105 patients studied, 80 were men and
25 women. The mean (SD) age was 30 (9) years
(range 18-62 years). All patients were of Italian
origin. None of the patients admitted to homo￾sexuality or were positive for antibody to human
immunodeficiency virus. None had received
steroid, immunosuppressive, or antiviral treat￾ment at any time before this study or during
follow up.
The most likely sources of HBV infection were
household contact in 31 (29%), medical exposure
in 21 (20%), and blood transfusion in 5 (5%)
patients. In 48 (46%) patients the clinical history
did not indicate the possible source of infection.
Patients were seen every six to 12 months, or
more often when required. At each visit blood
was taken for conventional liver biochemical
tests and hepatitis B serology and a sample of
serum was stored at -20°C. Biochemical
exacerbation was defined as an abrupt increase in
alanine aminotransferase activity to more than
three times the baseline value in patients whose
original values were at least twice the upper
normal limit.
The histological diagnosis in the first and in
follow up biopsy specimens was based on inter￾national criteria."1 Liver biopsy lesions were
classified as chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic
active hepatitis with moderate activity or with
severe activity when bridging hepatic necrosis
was present, or as active or inactive cirrhosis.

Natural history and prognosticfactorsfor chronic hepatitis type B
Bridging hepatic necrosis was defined as a lesion
seen on a liver biopsy specimen showing at least
one confluent area of necrosis bridging a portal
triad to a central vein or three bands of necrosis
bridging two central veins. Activity of liver
cirrhosis was defined by the presence of piece￾meal necrosis at the periphery of regenerative
nodules, adjacent to the portal zone. Liver
biopsy specimens without signs of liver cell
necrosis or inflammation and of fibrosis or
regenerative nodules were considered as normal.
HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs),
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), antibody to
hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) and antibody to
hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) were detected
using commercially available radioimmuno￾assays or enzyme linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) (Abbott Laboratories, N Chicago, Ill,
USA). Human T lymphotropic virus type III
(HTLVIII) antibody was tested by ELISA.
Serum HBV-DNA was measured by a dot￾blot hybridisation technique.'4 The sensitivity
limit of the assay, calculated using serial dilution
of cloned HBV-DNA at a known concentration
was 0.1 pg of HBV-DNA after five days'
exposure.
Anti-HCV was studied in serum by a recently
developed ELISA technique (Ortho HCV anti￾body ELISA system; Ortho Diagnostics, NJ,
USA). Frozen sera were thawed only once before
testing and were used at 1:10 dilution. Results
were expressed by optical density (OD) at
492 nm.
Hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) in liver was
examined by direct immunofluorescence.'5
Patients were tested serially for anti-HDV
seroconversion and for HDAg in follow up
biopsy specimens to identify superinfection with
the delta agent.

model using a BMDP LR computer program. 16 17
A total of 18 variables were considered as pos￾sible predictors of progression to cirrhosis in the
analysis (Table I). Curves of incidence of the
development of cirrhosis were computed by the
Kaplan-Meyer method and statistical signifi￾cance of the observed differences was assessed by
the log rank test.'8
Results
At presentation all 105 patients had raised
alanine aminotransferase values (mean (SD) 198
(201) IU/1; range 60-1650 IU/1).
Sixty six patients were HBeAg and HBV￾DNA positive, while one was HBeAg positive
but HBV-DNA negative in serum. The remain￾ing 38 patients were anti-HBe positive, and 26 of
them were positive for HBV-DNA in serum.
In 30 (29%) patients the disease was recognised
after an episode of acute hepatitis, which was
followed by biochemical evidence of continuing
liver disease. The initial hepatitis was icteric in
five and anicteric in 25 patients. Fifty six (53%)
patients were referred to our department because
of an occasional finding of HBsAg during routine
serological screening and the remaining 19 (18%)
for symptoms of chronic hepatitis.
Liver histology showed chronic persistent
hepatitis in 46, moderate chronic active hepatitis
in 51, and severe chronic active hepatitis with
bridging hepatic necrosis in eight patients. All
patients underwent at least one follow up liver
biopsy and there was a total of 146 specimens for
examination.
In 72 patients, serial serum samples were
available for anti-HCV evaluation at the time of
the initial liver biopsy and during follow up.
Nine (12.5%) patients (five with chronic active
hepatitis and four with chronic persistent hepa￾titis) were positive for anti-HCV, including five
(11%) of 45 HBeAg positive, one (5%) of 19 anti￾HBe/HBV-DNA positive, and three (37.5%) of
eight anti-HBe positive/HBV-DNA negative
patients.
FOLLOW UP
The 105 patients with chronic HBV infection
were followed longitudinally for one to 16 years
(mean (SD) 5 5 (3.5) years). During a mean (SD)
histological follow up of 3-7 (2.6) years, active
cirrhosis developed in 21 (20%) patients one to
13 years after entry to the study. Fifteen of these
patients had chronic active hepatitis and six had
chronic persistent hepatitis at presentation
(Table II). The calculated annual incidence of
progression to cirrhosis was 5.9%. The cumula￾tive probability of developing cirrhosis in all
patients is shown in Figure 1 and at the end of the
fifth year was 20%. Figure 2 shows the cumula￾tive probability of cirrhosis in our patients
according to histological diagnosis at presenta￾tion. The probability was significantly higher in
patients with chronic active hepatitis and bridg￾ing hepafc necrosis than in those with moderate
chronic-active or chronic persistent hepatitis

the time of histologic deterioration, including
one persistently anti-HCV positive patient. Of
the 72 patients tested for anti-HCV, one (7%) of
15 who developed cirrhosis and eight (14%) of 57
without histologic deterioration were anti-HCV
positive. Seven (87'5%) of eight patients present￾ing with severe chronic active hepatitis and
bridging hepatic necrosis deteriorated to active
cirrhosis.
Multivariate analysis using the stepwise Cox
regression analysis indicated that older age,
presence of severe chronic active hepatitis with
bridging hepatic necrosis, and continuing HBV
replication were independent predictors of pro￾gression to cirrhosis (Table IV).
The 21 patients who developed cirrhosis were
followed for an additional one to nine years after
histological deterioration. All were examined
endoscopically and three were noted to have
developed oesophageal varices. None of our
patients died.
Two patients underwent seroconversion from
HBeAg to anti-HBe with HBV-DNA clearance
and a return of alanine aminotransferase to
normal one and four years after development of
cirrhosis, while another anti-HBe positive
patient cleared HBV-DNA from serum with
biochemical remission one year after being diag￾nosed as cirrhotic.
No HDV events were seen during follow
up of the 105 patients with chronic HBV
infection.
Discussion
In this investigation we have analysed the natural
history and prognostic factors in chronic HBV
infection and were able to trace the course of the
disease with follow up liver biopsies in all
patients. Twenty one (20%) of the 105 untreated
patients with HBsAg positive chronic hepatitis
and without HDV infection showed progression
to cirrhosis during a mean histological follow up
period of 3-7 years. The cumulative probability
of cirrhosis in our patients at the end of the fifth
year was 20%, and these data are very close to the

Natural history and prognosticfactorsfor chronic hepatitis type B 297
results (15%) obtained in a recent prospective
study in Chinese patients with chronic HBV.8
Our results, which are derived from a large
series of patients with chronic HBV infection,
indicate that there is a limited number of features
at diagnosis which could accurately predict the
outcome of the disease.
Patients developing cirrhosis had higher initial
aspartate aminotransferase values than those
who did not progress to cirrhosis. Our data agree
with recent results indicating that in patients
with chronic HBV infection development of
cirrhosis is often accompanied by a rise in
aspartate:alanine aminotransferase ratio.'9 The
cause of the change in this ratio with deteriora￾tion of liver disease is, however, unknown.
The decreased mean serum albumin concen￾tration and prothombin time in patients who pro￾gressed to cirrhosis reflect an advanced stage of
liver disease. Serum aspartate aminotransferase
and albumin values and prothrombin time were
not, however, important independent variables
in the multivariate analysis when all the other
factors were considered.
When multivariate analysis of prognostic
factors was carried out three variables were
found to yield important and independent prog￾nostic information. Older age, presence of bridg￾ing hepatic necrosis, and persistence of HBV￾DNA in serum were unfavourable prognostic
factors.
Patients who developed cirrhosis were older
and the meaning of this finding is unclear. It is
suggested that host factors and in particular an
impaired function of the immune system occur￾ring in older people may lead to persistent HBV
replication and continuous liver damage.
Multivariate analysis showed that the presence
of bridging hepatic necrosis and continuing viral
replication were the most important risk factors
studied. Indeed extensive necrosis of hepato￾cytes either bridging the lobule or multilobular
necrosis seems to identify patients who are
particularly liable to develop cirrhosis. Histo￾logical severity also influenced a more rapid
deterioration. Our data obtained in a longi￾tudinal study indicate that chronic active
hepatitis with bridging necrosis is a serious
disease that frequently ends in cirrhosis, thus
confirming previous investigations. 12
On the contrary, an initial histology of
moderate chronic active or chronic persistent
hepatitis did not seem to make much difference
to the outcome, since the possibility of develop￾ing cirrhosis in patients with chronic active
disease without bridging necrosis was not greater
than that in patients with chronic persistent
hepatitis.
Ongoing HBV replication and expression of
viral antigens at the liver cell surface are certainly
important determinants for the pathogenesis of
HBV-associated liver disease.20"2
The continued replication of the virus may be
responsible for the perpetuation of the immune
mediated cytotoxic reaction and liver cell injury,
thus leading to the evolution of cirrhosis. In fact
most of our patients were persistently HBV￾DNA positive in serum, irrespective of the
HBeAg/anti-HBe system when cirrhosis was first
diagnosed. In our experience there was no dif￾ference in the rate of HBeAg (55%) and anti-HBe
(45%) positivity in patients with cirrhosis. Sero￾conversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe was
thought to imply loss of viraemia. However,
particularly in the Mediterranean area, more
than one third of anti-HBe positive patients with
chronic hepatitis have evidence of continuing
HBV replication documented by the presence of
serum HBV-DNA and liver HBcAg.2223 It has
been recently proposed that a mutation in the
nucleotide sequence of the pre-core region of the
HBV may prevent HBeAg production in
patients with continuing viral replication and
active liver disease.24
It is interesting to observe that two patients
who have already developed cirrhosis underwent
seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe with
serum HBV-DNA clearance and reduction of
disease activity, indicating that termination of
HBV replication may occur after the develop￾ment of cirrhosis and explaining the low HBeAg
positivity rate observed in patients with
advanced cirrhosis.25
HCV infection seemed to be the only risk
factor for progression to cirrhosis in one patient
with chronic HBV without evidence of continu￾ing HBV replication. Our data indicate, how￾ever, that HCV infection in HBsAg positive
chronic hepatitis did not correlate with histo￾logical deterioration.
No patient died and few complications were
observed during one to nine years of follow up
after the development of cirrhosis.
Our results agree with previous data which
indicate that patients with compensated cirrhosis
remain in the same condition for many years
after diagnosis.26
In conclusion, virological markers at diagnosis
are somewhat disappointing in terms of prog￾nostic assessment and only the evaluation of
virological changes during follow up seems use￾ful in defining the outcome of liver disease. Of
the clinical data at presentation, the most impor￾tant seems to be the presence of bridging
necrosis, while no differences were observed in
terms of prognosis between moderate chronic
active or chronic persistent hepatitis. Our
results suggest that patients with severe chronic
active hepatitis and lengthy persistence of HBV
replication are at very high risk of rapid progres￾sion to cirrhosis.
