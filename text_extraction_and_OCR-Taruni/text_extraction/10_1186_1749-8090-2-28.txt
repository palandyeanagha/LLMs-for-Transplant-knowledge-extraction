Abstract
Background: Lung transplantation (LTx) is widely accepted as a therapeutic option for end-stage
respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis. However, airway complications remain a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in these patients, serious airway complications like bronchopleural fistula
(BPF) are rare, and their management is very difficult.
Case presentation: A 47-year-old man with end-stage respiratory failure due to cystic fibrosis
underwent bilateral sequential lung transplantation. Severe post-operative bleeding occurred due
to dense intrapleural adhesions of the native lungs. He was re-explored and packed leading to
satisfactory haemostasis. He developed a bronchopleural fistula on the 14th post-operative day. The
fistula was successfully repaired using pericardial and intercostal vascular flaps with veno-venous
extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VV-ECMO) support. Subsequently his recovery was
uneventful.
Conclusion: The combination of pedicled intercostal and pericardial flaps provide adequate
vascular tissue for sealing a large BPF following LTx. Veno-venous ECMO allows a feasible bridge
to recovery.
Background
Airway complications remain a major cause of morbidity
and mortality after lung transplantation [1]. While the
overall incidence of such complications can be as high as
15%, bronchopleural fistulas (BPF) are fortunately very
uncommon. This is, however, a disastrous event after lung
transplants. Most cases occur early after transplantation,
are extremely difficult to treat and are associated with a
high mortality. We report successful surgical repair of
bronchopleural fistula in the donor bronchus employing
a Levitronix Centrimag® [Waltham, Massachusetts]-based
veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenator sup￾port with 6 days bridge to recovery.

Case presentation
A 47-year-old man with end-stage respiratory failure due
to cystic fibrosis underwent bilateral sequential lung
transplantation. The donor was a 48-year-old male who
died of sub-arachnoid haemorrhage and was ventilated
for 24 hours. The pulmonary evaluation was normal, with
a pO2 of 59.7 kPa on FiO2 of 1, normal chest X-ray and
bronchoscopic appearance. The retrieval was performed
with the standard technique, using both ante-grade and
retro-grade flush of low potassium dextran solution (Per￾fadex®). The transplantation was carried out through a
clamshell incision. Explantation of the native lungs was
protracted and difficult due to dense intra-pleural adhe￾sions. Implantation was performed with the standard
technique. The right lung was implanted first, using con￾tinuous 3/0 polypropylene sutures for the bronchial anas￾tomosis (end-end-technique), continuous 4/0
polypropylene sutures for the pulmonary vein to left atrial
anastomosis, and continuous 5/0 polypropylene sutures
for the pulmonary arterial anastomosis. According to the
standard technique, the donor bronchus was left as short
as possible, and the sutures were applied almost level with
the upper lobe division. The left lung was implanted in a
similar fashion. The overall ischemia time was 6 hours
and 8 minutes for the right lung, and just over 8 hours for
the left. The patient had a persistent left-sided superior
vena cava, which was carefully dissected away from the
pulmonary vessels. Despite measures to reduce bleeding,
including the use of intra-operative veno-arterial extra￾corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) instead of car￾diopulmonary bypass, generous use of blood product
replacement therapy and full dose of aprotinin, he bled
excessively from the pleural bed. Because of persistent
bleeding, the chest was packed at the end of operation
with skin closure. He was given routine immunosuppres￾sive therapy including induction with rabbit anti-thymo￾cyte globulin (RATG) and intravenous methyl
prednisolone (three doses of 125 mg each at 8 hourly
intervals, followed by a tapering regimen from 1 mg/kg/
day) according to our standard unit protocol.
During the immediate post-operative period, he was re￾explored twice due to bleeding. After correction of the
abnormal coagulation with fresh frozen plasma, cryopre￾cipitate and platelet transfusions, he was also given 3.6 mg
of recombinant activated factor VII. Eventually, the bleed￾ing settled and the chest was closed on the 4th post-opera￾tive day. Subsequent surveillance bronchoscopies showed
slough at the bronchial anastomoses with thick purulent
secretions in the distal airways bilaterally. A percutaneous
tracheostomy was performed on the 9th post-operative
day due to prolonged requirement for ventilatory support
and to aid in bronchial toilet, and the patient weaned suc￾cessfully from mechanical ventilation. The bronchoalveo￾lar aspirate revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida
parapsilosis, which were treated appropriately.
On the 14th post-operative day, while breathing spontane￾ously, the patient suddenly developed a right pneumoth￾orax, which was treated with a right intercostal drain [Fig
1]. Bronchoscopy revealed a sizable hole in the donor
right main bronchus distal to anastomosis [Fig 2]. Having
been previously stable, his condition rapidly deteriorated
over the next 24 hours, with pyrexia, requirement of ven￾tilatory support and signs of systemic sepsis. CT scan
could not be performed due to the clinical instability. A
prompt decision was made to repair the bronchopleural
fistula.
Single lung ventilation was attempted using left-sided
double lumen endo-tracheal tube but not tolerated due to
poor oxygenation, with oxygen saturations reducing to
85% on an FiO2 of 1. The patient was not in a suitable
state to undergo the surgical procedure; therefore veno￾venous ECMO was established using Levitronix Cen￾trimag® [Waltham, Massachusetts]. The right internal jug￾ular vein was cannulated with a 14 Fr Bio-Medicus® DLP
long cannula [Medtronic, Minneapoplis] for the oxygen￾ated return, and the right common femoral vein was can￾nulated with a 17 Fr Bio-Medicus® DLP long cannula
[Medtronic, Minneapoplis] for the deoxygenated venous
blood. Venous cannulation was performed percutane￾ously under the guidance of trans-oesophageal echocardi￾Chest X-ray showing right pneumothorax with an intercostal drain in situ Figure 1

ography to ensure adequate positioning of the cannulae.
A single intravenous dose of 5000 units of heparin was
given before the start of ECMO. We utilized a HILITE®
7000 LT oxygenator [Medos Medizintechnik AG] with a
Levitronix Centrimag® [Waltham, Massachusetts] pump.
There was an immediate improvement in gas exchange.
The oxygen saturations improved to 97%, with a pO2
10.6 kPa and pCO2 of 4.25 kPa. The ECMO flow rate was
maintained at 2.8 L/min, with the rotor at 3500 RPM (revs
per min). We proceeded with a right posterolateral thora￾cotomy. A 2 cm fistula was seen in the donor right main
bronchus, involving the membranous part posteriorly.
The fistula was closed with a large pericardial flap using
interrupted 3/0 polypropylene suture, reinforced with an
intercostal pedicle flap, which was dissected at the time of
thoracotomy. The pleural space was cleaned thoroughly
and all debris was washed prior to chest closure. The dou￾ble lumen endotracheal tube was removed following the
operation and ventilation was maintained using the single
lumen tracheostomy tube, on a pressure controlled venti￾lation mode with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 2
mm Hg and a peak pressure of up to 18 mm Hg at 12
breaths per minute. At the same time 100 % oxygen was
delivered in the ECMO circuit. Post-operative bronchos￾copy revealed excellent closure [Fig 3] and pleural space
air leak ceased completely post-operatively [Fig 4].

Results
The patient did very well. ECMO was maintained for 6
days after repair of the bronchopleural fistula and regular
surveillance bronchoscopy demonstrated intact anasto￾moses and satisfactory right main bronchus calibre. No
further heparin was given, and the activated clotting time
(ACT) was kept between 140 and 160 seconds. There were
no bleeding problems. Pressure controlled ventilation
was maintained using the single lumen tracheostomy
tube. The peak airway pressures were gradually increased
to 20–25 mm Hg at the time of removal of ECMO. The
oxygen delivered via ECMO was adjusted according to the
arterial blood gas results, and was successfully reduced to
40% within 4 days. After the first 48 hours, the ECMO
flow rate was maintained at 2.5 L/min, with 3200 RPM.
Prior to discontinuation of ECMO, the patient was relying
on his lung for oxygenation with no oxygen given through
the oxygenator. Both the cannulae were successfully
removed with application of pressure on the site and with￾out any problems. He was discharged home 59 days after
the original transplant, with an FEV1 of 2.01 litres and a
normal flow volume loop and he remains well 9 months
later.
Discussion
Bilateral sequential lung transplantation is now an
accepted therapeutic option for selected patients with
Cystic Fibrosis-related end-stage respiratory failure [2].
However, airway complications can result in significant
problems in these patients. Earlier transplants in 1980's
had a high incidence of life threatening anastomotic
dehiscence. With refined surgical techniques the fre￾quency of such events has diminished considerably [3-5].
While the overall incidence of significant airway compli￾cations is reported at 10–15% following lung transplanta￾tion, the risk of disastrous complications like anastomotic
dehiscence and bronchopleural fistula remains low [Table
1]. The incidence of BPF in our unit is under 1% in over
250 cases of lung transplantation, involving more than
300 bronchial anastomoses (unpublished data).
Several factors have been implicated in the aetiology of
bronchopleural fistula following lung transplantation.
Bronchial ischaemia is considered the major contributor,
as the bronchial circulation is lost during harvest and the
viability of the donor bronchus is initially dependent
upon retrograde low-pressure collaterals derived from the
pulmonary artery [6]. Our case had a bleeding problem
post-operatively, and required re-exploration and pack￾ing. The pressure of the packs or clots might have exacer￾bated ischaemia of the donor bronchus i.e. pressure
necrosis of the right main bronchus distal to the anasto￾mosis. In addition, we used activated factor VII to correct
coagulopathy. The use of activated factor seven had been
associated with the development of acute myocardial inf￾arction [7] but an association with the development of
bronchial ischaemia and dehiscence following lung trans￾plantation has not been reported.
To prevent ischemia of the donor bronchus, several anas￾tomotic techniques have been described, such as shorten￾ing the donor bronchus [8], end-end or telescopic
anastomosis, direct revascularization of the donor bron￾chial arteries and wrapping a vascularised omental or
internal mammary artery flap around the bronchial anas￾tomosis [9]. As the donor bronchial segment is dependent
on retrograde pulmonary blood flow, it seemed logical
that donor ischemia would be minimized by keeping the
donor bronchus as short as possible. This has been sup￾ported by clinical experience with double lung transplan￾tation with bilateral bronchial rather than tracheal
anastomoses [10]. We also keep the shortest possible
length of the donor bronchus. Initially the telescoping
technique was thought to prevent bronchial anastomotic
complications [6]; however recent evidence suggests that
the end-end anastomosis technique is associated with sig￾nificantly less airway complications [5]. Similarly the use
of running sutures in the membranous part and inter￾rupted stitches for the cartilaginous portion has conven￾tionally been advocated; however, recent evidence has
shown that the single running suture technique with
monofilament sutures used for bronchial anastomosis in
lung transplantation provides optimal results with regards
to early and long-term bronchial healing [11]. We have
used continuous running sutures as a standard for bron￾chial anastomosis at our institution for over 10 years. This
is the first case of bronchial disruption in our experience,

involving the membranous portion of the donor bron￾chus, distal to the anastomosis.
Direct bronchial artery revascularization has been
described by some authors [12,13], achieving complete
revascularization in up to 60% of patients. However, due
to the added complexity and equal incidence of complica￾tion rates, there is currently little evidence to support its
use. Wrapping the bronchial anastomosis with omentum
or other vascularized pedicles has demonstrated reestab￾lishment of collateral circulation to the donor bronchus
[14]. However, omentopexy adds substantial complexity
and morbidity to lung transplantation due to the addition
of a laparotomy and an obligatory diaphragmatic defect.
This technique is not infallible and has not been advo￾cated by some investigators [15]. Other vascularized flaps
have been employed to obviate omentopexy [16]; how￾ever, some investigators have shown satisfactory bron￾chial healing without any vascularized coverage of the
bronchus [17]. We do not utilise the technique of anasto￾motic wrapping in our centre.
The perioperative use of steroid therapy was believed to be
deleterious for the bronchial anastomosis [18], however
recent evidence suggests that low to moderate doses of
pre- and post-operative steroids do not affect bronchial
healing [3]. Our patient was not on maintenance pred￾nisolone prior to transplant.
Infections, particularly due to aspergillus, have been asso￾ciated with impaired bronchial healing [6] and a higher
rate of airway complications have been reported in
patients with septic lung disease (cystic fibrosis) [1]. Our
case showed evidence of bronchial infection with Pseu￾domonas aeruginosa and Candida parapsilosis, which might
have contributed to the development of BPF.
Management of BPF in lung transplant recipients is very
challenging with limited published experience in the Eng￾lish literature. With few exceptions, most reports pertain
to management of post pneumonectomy BPF in lung can￾cer patients. The approach will depend on a number of
factors such as the size and site, time between surgery and
presentation, whether or not empyema is present and the
patient's general health status. The key points of BPF man￾agement include empyema drainage and infection con￾trol, fistula closure and reinforcement, and pleural space
obliteration. Surgical closure techniques include direct
stump closure with flap reinforcement, trans-sternal bron￾chial closure, thoracoplasty with or without extra-thoracic
chest wall muscle transposition and video-assisted thora￾coscopy. Kirk et al described the surgical management of
bronchial dehiscence which occurred despite using an
omental flap in a case of lung transplantation for pulmo￾nary fibrosis [19]. They excised the necrotic bronchus and
re-anastomosed the distal healthy bronchus using inter￾rupted polypropylene sutures. They constructed the sec￾ond anastomosis at the level of bifurcation of the donor
left main bronchus, to achieve perfusion from pulmonary
bronchial collaterals. They also wrapped a vascular peri￾cardial flap around the anastomosis. We utilised pedicled
pericardial flap to close the BPF, and the intercostal flap to
reinforce the repair.
In high-risk surgical patients, endoscopic repair may serve
as the only therapeutic option. In 1977 Ratliff et al
reported the first successful endo-bronchial management
of BPF using tissue glue and a lead shot [20]. Since then,
many reports using different devices have appeared. These
include ethanol silver nitrate, cyanoacrylate compounds,
coils, lead plugs, balloons, fibrin or tissue glue, antibiot￾ics, gel foam, spigots, and autologous blood patch.
Recently Mora et al described a series of 18 patients,
including 1 post-lung transplant, treated endoscopically
for BPF [21]. The fistula was 9 mm in size, and appeared
30 days post-transplant. It was successfully closed by 2
injections of fibrin sealant (Tissucol®) through the cathe￾ter of the fiberoptic bronchoscope without any complica￾tions. In our case, the size of the fistula prohibited
bronchoscopic approach to treatment.
Borro et al described a case of spontaneous closure of
bronchial fistula to the mediastinum in a heart-lung trans￾plant patient [22]. They suggested that since the bronchial
perforation in their patient occurred in the 3rd post-opera￾tive week, full cicatrisation of the mediastinum helped
limit the spread of infection and contributed to the
favourable outcome obtained by adequate antibiotic and
physiotherapeutic treatment.
Achieving adequate ventilation is often difficult in these
patients, particularly if single lung ventilation has to be
achieved. The use of differential ventilation using double￾lumen endotracheal tube and jet ventilation or cardiopul￾monary bypass has been the traditional options [19]. We
utilised veno-venous ECMO, which is now an established
tool in our centre for managing patients with primary
graft failure after lung transplant. With improved technol￾ogy it is now possible to use this device with minimal
heparinization, thereby preventing any bleeding compli￾cations [23,24]. Our patient had severe intraplerual adhe￾sions, causing bleeding following explantation of the
native lungs. Therefore, based on the available evidence at
that time [23], we decided to use intra-operative veno￾arterial ECMO to avoid full heparinization otherwise nec￾essary with conventional cardiopulmonary bypass. How￾ever, we encountered bleeding problems post-operatively,
requiring blood products as well as activated factor VII.
Recently published data also suggests that intra-operative

use of ECMO may be associated with increased risk of
bleeding [25].
During the first 24 hours following the repair of BPF, the
patient required full ECMO support with 100% oxygen
delivery as the aim was to rest the lungs and reduce the
pressure on the repair. Afterwards, the ECMO require￾ment diminished. We, however, used ECMO for 6 days as
we believed that healing of the repaired bronchus would
be sufficient around that time. During this period we car￾ried out frequent flexible bronchoscopic assessments. At
day 5, the anastomosis appeared to be healing well.
To our knowledge this is the first reported case for using
ECMO as a bridge for successful surgical repair of BPF fol￾lowing lung transplantation utilising pericardial and
intercostal flaps. We have used the Levitronix Centrimag
device, which was maintained without any anticoagula￾tion for six days after repair of the fistula (ACT was kept
between 140–160 seconds). There were no clots in the
system on full examination when it was finally removed.
Conclusion
In summary, the combination of an intercostal and a
pedicled pericardial flap provides adequate robust vascu￾larised tissue for sealing a large BP fistula following lung
transplantation. Veno-venous ECMO allows a feasible
bridge to recovery.
