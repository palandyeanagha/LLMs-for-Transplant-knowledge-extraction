Time-intensity curve analysis of contrast￾enhanced ultrasound is unable to
differentiate renal dysfunction in the early
post-transplant period - a prospective study
Nordeval Cavalcante Araújo1,2* and José Hermógenes Rocco Suassuna1
Abstract
Background: Contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) assessment of kidney allografts mainly focuses on graft
rejection. However, studies on delayed graft function (DGF) without acute rejection are still lacking. The aim of this
study was to build a time-intensity curve (TIC) using CEUS in non-immunological DGF to understand the utility of
CEUS in early transplantation.
Methods: Twenty-eight patients in the short-term postoperative period (<14 days) were divided according to the
need for dialysis (early graft function [EGF] and [DGF]) and 37 subjects with longer than 90 days follow-up were
divided into creatinine tertiles. Time to peak [TTP] and rising time [RT were compared between groups.
Results: EGF and DGF were similar, except for creatinine. In comparison to the late group, medullary TTP and RT
were shorter in the early group as well as the delay regarding contrast arrival in the medulla (in relation to cortex)
and reaching the medullary peak (in relation to artery and cortex). In the late group, patients with renal dysfunction
showed shorter temporal difference to reach medullary peak in relation to artery and cortex.
Conclusions: Although it was not possible to differentiate EGF and DGF using TIC, differences between early and
late groups point to blood shunting in renal dysfunction.

Background
Since the advent of the contrast enhanced sonography (CEUS)
in the early 1980s, many studies have shown the potential of
this methodology in different fields of medical imaging [1, 2].
Inspired by successes in imaging the liver, efforts have been
made by several researchers to test the utility of this technique
in the evaluation of the kidney [3, 4]. In addition to the value
of the method for imaging focal lesions [5], great interest has
been focused on the assessment of renal blood perfusion [6].
Groups particularly interested in exploring this question have
reported encouraging preliminary results in human and ani￾mal studies [7–9]. It is therefore not surprising that the utility
of CEUS for assessing the perfusion characteristics of kidney
allografts has also been investigated [10, 11]. After CEUS
examination, the quantification of allograft perfusion by means
of time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis enables the measure￾ment of the rate of blood flow in regions of interest (ROI) in
different kidney territories [12]. The TIC software allows one
to visualize the perfusion curve fitting in a graphical format,
enabling parameters based on arrival and peak time of con￾trast. Accordingly, time to peak (TTP) and rising time (RT)
are parameters commonly used to quantify perfusion [13].
The absolute value of a given parameter for a specific kidney
region and the difference in its behavior in different kidney
regions has been used to characterize allograft dysfunction
secondary to acute rejection [12, 14]. However, studies on
delayed graft function (DGF) without acute rejection are still
lacking.
The aim of this study was to perform CEUS examina￾tions on renal transplant recipients and to interpret the

findings on non-immunological DGF (defined as the
need for dialysis) in light of current concepts of the
pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The
findings may help us understand the utility of this tech￾nique in early renal transplantation.
Methods
This is a prospective observational study, based on single
samples. Two groups of patients were enrolled, one in the
short-term postoperative period (less than or equal to 14
days after surgery) comprised of 29 patients who underwent
kidney transplantation at our institution in a three-year
period from September 2014 to October 2017, and the other
comprised of 38 outpatient subjects whose post-transplant
follow-up time was greater than or equal to 90 days. All pa￾tients from the early group received immunosuppression
therapy, consisting of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and myco￾phenolate mofetil, while in the long-term group, rapamycin,
cyclosporine or tacrolimus was given in addition to myco￾phenolate mofetil or azathioprine. All patients from both
groups were given steroids. There were six living donors in
the early group and 20 in the late group. All deceased donor
kidneys came from heart beating donors.
Some variables associated with the graft were studied. These
included the duration of dialysis (time span in months), recipi￾ent and donor age and serum creatinine, pre-transplant
panel-reactive antibodies, number of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) mismatches, causa mortis and cold ischemia time
(CIT). Calculation of the HLA mismatches has been done by
the sum of every single mismatch in the A, B and DR loci.
The histopathological report of peri-implantation wedge biop￾sies were also analysed: percentage of glomerular obsolescence
(in relation to the number of glomeruli in each biopsy), and
presence or absence of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy,
interstitial infiltration and edema, vascular lesions (arteriolar
hyalinosis, arteriolosclerosis and fibrosis endarteritis), and
acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
CEUS examination was performed using a 3.5 MHz
convex transducer (Aplio 400; Toshiba; Tokyo, Japan)
with a bolus injection of 2.4 ml of Sonovue® (Bracco Int;
Milan, Italy) followed by 5 ml of saline solution using a
20-gauge intravenous cannula.
Initially, all patients in our study underwent conven￾tional graft B-mode and Doppler sonography. Assessment
of graft size and resistive index (RI) were performed in a
sagittal plane with a usual mechanical index (MI) of 1. At
least three intrarenal arteries were interrogated to calcu￾late RI and were expressed as means for calculation.
After routine ultrasound, CEUS was performed at a low
MI (0.07). The transducer was held in a stable position in
coronal plane and the equipment settings (gain, focus pos￾ition) were kept constant during the procedure. Patients
were requested to breath shallow during examination. Data
acquisition was documented by digitally storing the images
at the start of Sonovue injection over 60s in DICOM format.
Regions of interest (ROIs) in the kidney were manually out￾lined by a trackball-guided cursor technique. ROIs were de￾fined in the area of the segmental artery, medullary pyramid
and subcapsular cortex (Fig. 1). Using the freehand “lasso tool”
of the software, each ROI was placed over the best visualized
artery and medullary pyramid, while the most area of the cor￾tex was selected regardless of the perfusion quality. Since the
ROI was adjusted for each territory, the resulting areas were
different for each territory in each patient. Since the accuracy
of CEUS is limited by tissue motion artifacts, the position of
the ROIs was adjusted frame by frame using the tracking tool
in the software. Cases in which this procedure was unable to
correct motion artifacts were discarded. Subsequently, quanti￾tative analysis with the TIC was used to estimate the time to
arrive to and reach the peak of enhancement in three different
territories of the graft using the US system’s inbuilt TIC soft￾ware (Toshiba’s CHI-Q). Time to peak (TTP) was calcu￾lated according to the corresponding time marks (vertical)
of both nadir (between injection and contrast arrival) and
peak enhancement, automatically chosen by the software,
while rising time (RT) was calculated from the time mark
at which a convincing increase in the deflection of the
curve was observed until the curve slope clearly flattened
(approximately more than 45° relative to a vertical line),
chosen by the observer (Fig. 2). Accordingly, RT repre￾sents as much as 80% of the total contrast agent

enhancement in the ROI [13]. To calculate TTP, the con￾trast arrival time of the artery was also used for the cortex
and medulla. Using both parameters, it was possible to cal￾culate the temporal difference in contrast arrival (for RT)
and peak enhancement time between the artery and the
cortex and the medullary pyramid and also between the
cortex and the medullary pyramid (for TTP and RT). TTP,
RT and delay time between territories were compared be￾tween both groups (early and late), in the early group be￾tween EGF and DGF patients, and in the late group
between stable and renal dysfunction patients and corre￾lated with clinical and histological variables.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation for
continuous variables and as percentages for dichotomous
variables. Groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney
test for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for cat￾egorical variables. Correlations between continuous vari￾ables were assessed by Pearson’s test. Data were analyzed
using SPSS software, version 17. Significant differences be￾tween groups are indicated by a p-value less than 0.05.
The study protocol was approved by the by the institu￾tional ethics committee. All subjects provided written in￾formed consent for participation in the study.
Results
No adverse effects from the contrast agent were noted.
Fourteen out of 81 patients were excluded because of ar￾tery stenosis, hydronephrosis, acute rejection and poor
study quality (severe breathing motion and cough). The
characteristics of the 67 patients eligible for the study are
given in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
According to the time after transplantation surgery, the
early group comprised 19 patients within 7 days and 10 be￾tween 8 and 14 days; in the late group, all 38 patients were
more than 90 days post-transplant. Since there were no dif￾ferences between the two subsets of patients in the early
group, except for recipient serum creatinine level (Table 1),
they were considered as one group for comparison with the
late group.
The late group was further divided in tertiles (reflect￾ing the 33rd and 66th percentiles of distribution) ac￾cording to the recipient serum creatinine (mg/dl).
Thirteen subjects had creatinine < 1.65 (lowest tertile),
12 had creatinine > 1.65 and < 2.4 (middle tertile), and
13 had creatinine > 2.40 (highest tertile). For compari￾son, the lowest tertile patients were considered to have
stable renal function and the highest tertile indicated
renal dysfunction.
In the early group, there were no differences between
EGF and DGF patients in the analyzed variables, includ￾ing TIC parameters, except for a lower recipient serum
creatinine level in the former group (Table 1). Similarly,
there were no differences in the frequency of HLA mis￾matches, causa mortis, donor type, donor sex, induction
agents and maintenance immunosuppression with a cal￾cineurin inhibitor between EGF and DGF (p > 0.05). In
addition, there were no differences in the frequency of
glomerular obsolescence, interstitial fibrosis, interstitial
infiltration, acute tubular necrosis and vascular changes
in the perioperative biopsy between EGF and DGF (p >
0.05).
In comparison to the whole late group, donors were
younger, medullary time to peak was shorter, and the tem￾poral differences regarding contrast arrival in the medulla
in relation to the cortex and reaching the medullary peak
in relation to the artery and the cortex were also shorter
in the early group (Table 2). The same comparison using
the subset of patients of the late group with creatinine in
the lowest tertile yielded even better results from a statis￾tical point of view (Table 2).
When comparing the lowest and highest tertiles, pa￾tients with renal dysfunction showed shorter temporal dif￾ferences in reaching the medullary peak in relation to the
artery and the cortex and older age of the donor (Table 3).

Discussion
Monitoring kidney graft perfusion may theoretically lead to
the early recognition of hemodynamic changes and allow for
the implementation of adequate preventive and curative
strategies that could ultimately limit graft dysfunction or pro￾gression. The obligatory surgical and conservation proce￾dures involved in the recovery of deceased donor kidney
allografts for transplantation contribute to the occurrence of
kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after kidney trans￾plantation [15]. Clinically, IRI in renal transplant manifests
as failure of the kidney to function properly, known as DGF
when the injury is sufficiently severe. Despite the lack of a
consensus definition, DGF is commonly defined as the need
for dialysis during the first post-transplant week [16].
Besides being a common cause of DGF, IRI shares many
characteristics with post-ischemic acute renal injury in native
kidneys [17]. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the
two conditions share the same pathophysiological mecha￾nisms. There is a consensus that the initial reduction in RBF
triggers the development of an event cascade that ultimately
underlies the abrupt and intense reduction in the glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) in IRI [18]. However, a short time is ne￾cessary for the recovery of RBF [19, 20] or the magnitude of
decrement does not parallel GFR reduction in native [21] as
well as in allograft kidney [21, 22].
Based on many studies performed in recent decades,
there is considerable evidence from experimental animal
models as well as humans that a reduction in medullary
blood flow contributes to the pathogenesis of acute kid￾ney injury [18, 23, 24]. Therefore, the most important
rationale for the assessment of renal blood perfusion
and differences in the features of different territories of
the graft relies on the known pathophysiological role of
RBF changes in acute renal failure secondary to IRI.
The utility of CEUS for the measurement of RBF is com￾parable with that of other methods. Using TIC parameters
derived from intravenous continuous infusion studies, a sig￾nificant correlation (r = 0.69, P < 0.005) has been demon￾strated between CEUS and RBF determined by PAH
clearance in humans [7, 8] and by an ultrasonic flow probe
applied directly over the renal artery in dogs [6] and rats [9].
On the other hand, using the bolus technique, contrast en￾hanced sonography has provided renal perfusion results
similar to those obtained with technetium Tc 99 m diethyle￾netriamine pentaacetic acid in human renal transplant recipi￾ents [25] and with laser-Doppler flowmetry in mice [26].
The current study examined how the use of CEUS may
help non-invasively differentiate EGF and DGF in renal
graft recipients early after implantation by establishing the
linkage between the need for dialysis and the results of
TIC analysis. The work yielded two main results. First, it
was not possible to differentiate EGF and DGF (excluding
acute rejection) patients using TTP or RT derived from
TIC analysis performed in three kidney territories (seg￾mental artery, cortex and medulla). This is in accordance
with a previous report that found no perfusion quotient
difference between non-dialyzed patients (slow graft func￾tion) and DGF patients with biopsy-proven acute tubular
necrosis [27]. The similarities in the TIC analysis of EGF
and DGF patients were further supported by the absence of
differences in TTP and RT between early acute tubular ne￾crosis (0.21 months) and stable patients (8.31 months) [13].
Conversely, using the bolus technique in the early posttrans￾plant period, acute renal transplant rejection patients in
comparison with non-rejecting patients showed an increase
in cortex TTP [14, 28], a delay in the first conspicuous

increase in the value between the renal cortex and the main
renal artery [10], and a delay in the maximum value of the
inflow from the segmental arteries to the cortex and to the
pyramids [12]. An increase in medullary RT and TTP has
also been reported in late (> 20 months) acute rejection com￾pared to stable patients (8 months) [13].
The findings of the present study are consistent with
those that found similar results using other methods. In￾deed, no differences in RBF have been found between im￾mediate graft function (or recovering acute renal failure)
and delayed graft function (or sustained acute renal fail￾ure) in allograft recipients, using Doppler flowmetry [29]
or p-aminohippurate and phase contrast cine-magnetic
resonance imaging methods [17, 22].
It is reasonable to keep in mind that the two groups
(EGF and DGF) have been exposed to the same conditions
(pre-donation brain death, recovery procedures and effects
of anesthesia and surgery) that could have deleterious ef￾fects on renal function. One can speculate that the differ￾ence in the extent of damage within groups, if one exists,
it is not related to blood flow changes, nor is it possible to
assess using CEUS.
Although other reports [14, 28] have shown a significant
difference in TIC parameters between good graft function
and acute rejection, these indexes do not apply for differ￾entiating DGF (without acute rejection) from EGF. Since
our patients were not submitted to biopsy after transplant￾ation, it was not possible to compare the results of CEUS

according to the histological features. However, from a
clinical point of view, the need for early dialysis is one of the
more important issues following transplantation. Nonethe￾less, until now, CEUS has not been a standard examination
in routine clinical practice to assess renal RBF yet in contrast
to the increasing use to evaluate focal lesions.
A second important finding of this study is that early
postoperative renal transplant recipients, in comparison to
good functioning graft patients at least 90 days after sur￾gery, showed a clear difference in TIC parameters. TTP
and RT are parameters that mirror the wash-in of the con￾trast through the ROIs. Since TTP includes part of the
contrast time traveling from the injection site to the ROI,
it can be affected by prerenal factors, while RT reflects the
enhancement process exclusively within the ROI [13].
However, in the current study, the two parameters showed
a good correlation. Taken together, the differences in TTP
and RT point towards a delayed time to reach the cortex
peak and a shorter time to travel through the medulla in
early group in comparison with the late group as a whole
and especially with the subset of patients with creatinine
levels in the lowest tertile (stable renal function). The lon￾ger time to reach the cortex peak is in accordance with
the higher resistive index seen in the early group. On the
other hand, a shorter time to reach the medullary peak
and faster transit time through the medulla would be ex￾pected if a microcirculation shunt has taken place [30].
Vascular bypasses that give rise to a descending vasa reta [31],
including continuous afferent-efferent vessels and short vascu￾lar connections between afferent and afferent arterioles [32],
have been reported in approximately 10% of juxtamedullary
glomeruli [31]. The role of possible arteriovenous fistulae fol￾lowing perioperative allograft biopsy has not been taken into
consideration, but should also be kept in mind [33]. Within
the late group, the comparison of TIC parameters between
the lowest and highest creatinine tertiles provides further evi￾dence of a change in regional RBF in renal dysfunction. More￾over, using continuous infusion of contrast agent, it has been
shown that serum creatinine levels are inversely related to
RBF in renal transplant recipients [11].
The weakness of this study is that no biopsies were taken
after transplantation (besides peri-implantation wedge biop￾sies) to better differentiate the groups. Therefore, it is pos￾sible that the EGF and DGF subgroups were unequally
contaminated by cases of acute rejection and/or acute tubu￾lar necrosis. However, it is well-known that using the current
immunosuppressive regimen, the incidence of acute rejection
in the first 2 weeks is as low as 2.28% (6/263) [34] and the
median time to the acute rejection is 23 days [35]. Moreover,
in the two groups, the kidney size and Doppler indices were
fairly similar, providing additional evidence of the homogen￾eity of the two groups. Therefore, the likelihood of patient
selection bias is negligible.
Conclusion
In accordance with other reports, the results ob￾tained in the current study point toward the ability
of CEUS to detect changes in contrast enhancement
in different kidney territories of the graft using TIC.
Although clear differences were found in TIC pa￾rameters between early and late transplant patients,
no blood flow differences between DGF and EGF pa￾tients could be demonstrated using CEUS in the
early post-transplant period. These results seem to
support that some approaches to increase renal
blood flow in DGF are useless.
