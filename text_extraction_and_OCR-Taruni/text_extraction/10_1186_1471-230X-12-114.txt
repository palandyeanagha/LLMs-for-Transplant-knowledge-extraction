Abstract
Background: Portal vein thrombosis is a frequent complication in end-stage cirrhosis with a considerable
peri-operative risk for liver transplant candidates. We aimed to characterize the pre-transplant portal vein
thrombosis in a cohort of liver transplant recipients, and to identify independent risk factors for this complication.
Methods: 380 consecutive primary orthotopic liver transplants were performed in the Digestive Surgery
Department of “12 de Octubre” Hospital (Madrid, Spain), between January 2001 and December 2006. The main risk
factors considered were smoking, obesity, metabolic disorders, previous immobility, surgery or trauma, nephrotic
syndrome, associated tumor, inflammatory disease, neoplasm myeloprolipherative. Furthermore we have reported
genetic thrombophilia results for 271 recipients.
Results: Sixty-two (16.3%) patients developed pre-transplant portal vein thrombosis and its presence had no
impact in the overall survival of liver recipients. Obesity was the only independent risk factor for pre-transplant
portal vein thrombosis.
Conclusion: We recommend close control of cardiovascular factors in patients with liver cirrhosis in order to avoid
associated thrombosis.

Background
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a well recognized com￾plication in patients with end-stage cirrhosis, and its
incidence ranges from 2 to 26% in different series [1].
PVT has various causes. The cause may be local, such as
cirrhosis, primary or metastatic liver cancer, pylephlebi￾tis, vascular abnormalities, and pancreatitis. Alternatively
PVT may result from a thrombophilic condition such
as myeloproliferative disease, Protein C (PC), Protein S
(PS) and Antithrombin (AT) deficiency, or Factor V
Leiden and Factor IIG20210A carriers, or a combination
of a primary thrombophilia milieu that triggers the for￾mation of the thrombus in the portal circulation [2].
PVT continues to be associated with a considerable
peri-operative risk for liver transplant candidates [3,4],
and is associated with increased operative time, transfu￾sion requirements, re-interventions, and lower survival
rate relative to PVT extension [5]. Therefore, PVT has
been seen as an obstacle to orthotopic liver transplant￾ation (OLT).
We aimed to identify possible parameters that could
lead to PVT in a cohort of liver transplant recipients.
The influence of this thrombosis in the survival of liver
recipient was also evaluated.
This work is related to our previous publication [6]
where we analyzed the post-transplant thrombotic
events in a cohort of liver transplant recipients to iden￾tify possible parameters that could lead to HAT and
could be responsible for graft loss due to thrombosis in
a extended thrombophilia study. Our results showed
that high fibrinogen and decreased protein C levels were

parameters associated with allograft thrombosis. In the
present study we analyzed the factors related to portal
vein thrombosis in the pre-transplant period and their
prognostic implications.
Materials and methods
Patient population
Between January 2001 and December 2006, 380 primary
orthotopic liver transplants (OLT) were performed in
the Digestive Surgery Department of the 12 de Octubre
Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Wherever possible all patients
are lab tested for genetic hypercoagulation study irre￾spective of any presence of thrombophilia. We have
reported genetic thrombophilia and JAK2 mutations
results for 271 primary OLT recipients. The study was
approved by our Institutional Review Board and all
patients gave their consent for blood samples to be fur￾ther processed. Data on thrombophilia risk factors were
collected by personal interview, or by reviewing the
medical history.
Recipients
The study population comprised 254 males and 126
females. The cause of liver transplantation was: 18 HBV
(hepatitis B virus), 73 HCV (hepatitis C virus), 52 HBV
and HCV, 62 Ethanol, 8 Autoimmune, 8 Toxicity,
29 Tumor, 63 HBV or HCV and tumor, 2 Vascular,
26 Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficits, 24 Biliary atresia and
15 cryptogenetic.
Methods
Genetic thrombophilia study
The extracted genomic DNA was processed to detect
Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A and methylene￾tetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) C667T mutations, using real￾time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with hybridization
probes in a light-cycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany).
JAK2 mutations study
JAK2 V617F ASO quantitative PCR (ASO qPCR) was per￾formed with the ABI PRISM 7900 (Applied Biosystems,
Palo Alto, CA, USA), and a forward ASO primer span￾ning of the JAK2 V617F mutation region. A reverse pri￾mer and MGB TaqMan probe were also employed [7].
Follow-up
The follow-up period for recipients began on the date of
liver transplantation, and ended on the date of death,
date of re-transplant, or the end of study (March 1,
2007). Follow-up periods ranged from 15 d to 6.9 y
(median: 20.23 months).
Statistical analyses
The Pearson’s chi-square (χ2) statistic and the Student’st
test were used to test for differences in the distribution
of dichotomous variables, and for differences in the
mean values of continuous distributions. Forward step￾wise logistic regression was used to identify independent
risk factors for PVT. The following variables collected at
diagnosis were included in the database: gender (male/
female), age (both as a continuous variable, and group￾ing patients over and under 16 years of age), the exist￾ence of clinical thrombophilia risk factors and the
original liver disease.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the day of the
liver transplantation to death. Kaplan-Meier life tables
were constructed for survival data and were compared by
means of the log-rank test. A census of the surviving
patients was taken on March 1, 2007. Results with a
P value less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Thrombophilia in the study population
Genetic study of thrombophilia.- The prevalence of the
heterozygote Factor V Leiden mutation was 7 of 271
(2.6%), the heterozygote G20210A prothrombin muta￾tion was 13 (4.8%), and the homozygote C677T MTHFR
mutation was 39 (14.9%). No correlation was observed
between pre-transplant PVT and the genetic thrombo￾philia study (Table 1).
JAK2 mutation in liver recipients.- JAK2 V617F was
only detected in four of the 271 primary OLT recipients
included in this study, details as follows: one patient

(such as the existence of diabetes or lipid alteration and
obesity) were most frequent in the group with pre￾transplant PVT (24 cases of diabetes or lipid alteration
out of 49 with pre-transplant PVT, versus 68 of 203
without pre-transplant PVT, P = 0.043; and 5 cases of
obesity out of 42 with pre-transplant PVT, versus 4 of
182 without pre-transplant thrombotic event, P = 0.004)
(see Table 3). Neither the presence of tumour
(P = 0.951), nor smoking (P = 0.169), were associated
with pre-transplant PVT. Nevertheless child recipient
was less frequent in the group with pre-transplant PVT
(2 cases of 62 recipients with PVT, versus 48 of 318 reci￾pients without PVT, p = 0.011) (Table 3).
Multivariate study
In the multivariate study, the only variable associated
with pre-transplant PVT was obesity (no/yes) (HR 13.2,
P < 0.02) (Table 4).
Survival analysis
Kaplan Meier tests were performed (Figure 1) and the
results indicated that pre-transplant PVT was not asso￾ciated with a poor outcome.
Discussion
During a liver transplantation, pre-transplant PVT,
encountered in approximately 15% of candidates, increases
surgical difficulties and post-operative PV re-thromboses
[8]. However, there is no extensive thrombophilia study
in a large cohort of liver recipients. In our study, all cases
are characterized by the presence of local thrombophilia
risk factors: cirrhosis and other factors such as primary
cancer, vascular abnormalities. We found obesity as the
only clinical factor associated with pre-transplant PVT.
Previously obesity has been considered to be a risk factor
for the venous thromboembolism as well as arterial
thrombosis [9-15], and was also previously reported as
an independent risk factor for clinical decompensation
in patients with cirrhosis [16] but it had not been pre￾viously associated with PVT. Plausible mechanisms
to explain the relation between obesity and venous
thrombosis include the existence of a proinflammatory,
prothrombotic, and hypofibrinolitic milieu in the obese
patients [12,13].
The importance of genetic thrombophilia risk factors
in PVT has been investigated in several studies [17-20]
but all of them have excluded cases with local risk fac￾tors. The incidence of Factor V Leiden, prothrombin
mutation, decreased PC, decreased PS, and decreased
AT has been recorded between 3-30%, 3-22%, 0-26%, 2-
43%, and 1-26%, respectively. In our study the incidence
of Factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, was 2.4%
and 4.5%, respectively. The incidence of Factor V Leiden
and prothrombin mutations coincide with that seen in
the general population and this fact could prove that
genetic thrombophilia has no role in pre-transplant PVT
in patients with cirrhosis.
JAK2 V617F testing represented an important advance
in the diagnostic workup for the recognition of atypical
myeloproliferative disease in BCS and PVT patients [21].
Our results do not support the routine screening of
JAK2 V617F mutation in patients with splanchnic
thrombosis in terminal cirrhosis or malignancy, except
when patients have Budd-Chiari syndrome. Our results
do not contradict Plessier et al where patients with
cirrhosis or malignacy were specifically excluded [22].

Unlike previous studies [3,23,24],the presence of pre￾transplant PVT did not influence the overall survival of
recipients. Other authors also reported no significant
differences between both groups for 1- to 10-year
patient survival [25-28].
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive
genetic thrombophilia study in a large cohort of liver
recipients. Obesity and diabetes mellitus and/or hyper￾lipidaemia were associated with pre-transplant PVT, but
obesity was the only independent risk factor for pre￾transplant PVT. We stress the importance of controlling
the cardiovascular factors in patients with liver cirrhosis.
