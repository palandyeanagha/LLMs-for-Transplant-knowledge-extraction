Abstract Introduction
Our group has previously demonstrated that oxidized phos￾pholipids in mildly oxidized LDL (MM-LDL) produced by
oxidation with lipoxygenase, iron, or cocultures of artery
wall cells increase monocyte-endothelial interactions and
this sequence of events is blocked by HDL. To obtain further
insight into the mechanism by which HDL abolishes the
activity of MM-LDL we investigated the effect of the HDL￾associated ester hydrolase paraoxonase (PON). Treatment
of MM-LDL with purified PON significantly reduced the
ability of MM-LDL to induce monocyte-endothelial inter￾actions. Inactivation of PON by pretreating HDL with heat
or EDTA reduced the ability of HDL to inhibit LDL modifi￾cation. HPLC analysis of phospholipids isolated from MM￾LDL before and after treatment with purified PON showed
that the 270 nm absorbance of phospholipids was decreased,
while no effect was observed on 235 nm absorbance. Oxi￾dized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl￾choline (Ox-PAPC) and specific fractions of Ox-PAPC iso￾lated by HPLC induced the same monocyte-endothelial in￾teractions as did MM-LDL. Biologically active and inactive
HPLC fractions of Ox-PAPC were compared by fast atom
bombardment-mass spectrometry which revealed that ac￾tive fractions possessed ions with a mass to change ratio
greater than native PAPC by multiples of 16 D suggesting
the addition of 3 and 4 oxygen atoms to PAPC. Comparison
of Ox-PAPC by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry
before and after PON treatment showed that PON destroyed
these multi-oxygenated molecules found in biologically ac￾tive fractions of Ox-PAPC. These results suggest that PON
in HDL may protect against the induction of inflammatory
responses in artery wall cells by destroying biologically ac￾tive lipids in mildly oxidized LDL. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995.

Oxidation of LDL appears to play an important role in the
development and progression of the atherosclerotic lesion (1 -
3). Artery wall cells can produce oxidative species via multiple
pathways which "seed" LDL trapped in the subendothelial
space and initiate lipid oxidation (4-6). The biological proper￾ties of oxidized LDL in vitro appear to be dependent on the
degree to which the lipid and protein components are oxidized.
Mildly oxidized LDL (MM-LDL)' induces the activation of
the nuclear transcription factor NFKB via a cAMP-dependent
mechanism (7) and consequently induces endothelial cells to
express monocyte-specific chemoattractants (8, 9), adhesion
molecules (10), and colony stimulating factors (11). Highly
oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) is cytotoxic to artery wall cells (12-
14) and is taken up by the scavenger receptor on macrophages
(15-17). In humans, plasma levels of HDL are inversely corre￾lated with the risk of clinically significant coronary events ( 18,
19). Moreover, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that
HDL inhibits LDL modification (9, 14, 20, 21). Despite con￾vincing evidence for the presence of oxidized LDL in the blood
vessel wall (22-24) and the antiatherogenic properties of HDL,
the interaction between these two lipoprotein particles is not
well understood.
Human serum paraoxonase (PON) is a calcium-dependent
HDL-associated ester hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of
organophosphates, aromatic carboxylic acid esters, and carba￾mates (25). The initial measurement of its activity was per￾formed using synthetic substrates, therefore, an interesting, and
as yet unresolved question, is what role PON plays in metaboliz￾ing substrates formed in vivo. PON is tightly associated with
apolipoprotein A-I in HDL and has the highest activity in the
liver and blood (25). Serum PON levels vary widely between
different animal species (26) and among humans (27). Individ￾uals with familial hypercholesterolemia and insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus have significantly lower serum levels of PON
than do control individuals (28). Low levels of HDL-associated
esterases are also correlated with susceptibility to myocardial
infarction, fish eye disease, and Tangier disease (29, 30). HDL￾associated PON has been reported to inhibit copper-induced
lipid peroxide generation in LDL (31). Our laboratory has re￾cently shown that platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase
(PAF-AH), a phospholipase A2 that hydrolyzes short chain acyl
groups and longer chain aldehydes esterified to the sn-2 position

of phospholipids, plays an important role in modulating the
biological activity of MM-LDL (32). Based on the studies
reported here we hypothesize that PAF-AH and PON in HDL
may work in concert to reduce the content of biologically active
oxidized phospholipids in MM-LDL and, in part, account for
the inverse relationship between HDL and the risk for clinical
events resulting from atherosclerosis.
Methods
Materials. Tissue culture media, serum, and supplements were obtained
from sources previously reported (9, 10). Acetonitrile, chloroform, hex￾ane, methanol, 2-propanol, triethylamine (all HPLC grade or better)
were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA. Gelatin (endo￾toxin-free, tissue culture grade, # G 9391 ) and butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Au￾thentic L-a-l-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine
(PAPC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL
and L-a-l-palmitoyl-2- [1- 14C] -arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl￾choline was purchased from DuPont NEN, Boston, MA. Amino and
C18 solid phase extraction columns were obtained from J.T. Baker,
Phillipsburg, NJ. Transwells and chamber slides were obtained from
Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA. Centricons were obtained from Amicon
Corp., Beverly, MA. PON was isolated from human or rabbit plasma
as described (33).
Endothelial cell cultures. Rabbit aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) at
passages 9-17 and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) at passages
4-7 were cultured as described (9, 10). Porcine aortic endothelial cells
(PAEC) were isolated by enzymatic digestion according to the method
of Rosenthal et al. (34) with described modifications (32).
Cocultures. HAEC and human aortic smooth muscle cells
(HASMC) were isolated and prepared as previously described (9, 32,
35). Blood monocytes were obtained from a large pool of healthy donors
using a modification of the Recalde procedure (36).
Lipoprotein isolation and modification. LDL (d = 1.019-1.069
grams/ml) and HDL (d = 1.069-1.210 grams/ml) were isolated from
the sera of normal blood donors by density gradient ultracentrifugation
as described (37) and stored at 40C until use within 1-2 wk of isolation.
Lipoprotein concentration was expressed in terms of protein content
throughout this report. Mildly oxidized LDL was produced either by
dialysis at 5 mg protein/ml in 6 jM FeSO47 H20 for 48-72 h at room
temperature, by incubation at 1 mg protein/ml with soybean lipoxygen￾ase (SLO) bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads with linoleic acid
(187 mM) in 1 ml PBS for 24 h at 37°C (32), or by incubation with
human endothelial/smooth muscle cell cocultures for 8-24 h at 37°C
(9). SLO was removed by centrifugation after oxidation had occurred.
Oxidation was terminated by the addition of EDTA and BHT at 100
/iM and 0.3 mM, respectively. EDTA was excluded in experiments
using PON. The concentration of bacterial endotoxin in medium con￾taining each agonist was < 50 pg/ml (determined by chromogenic
assay) which is 50-fold less than that required to induce monocyte
binding to endothelial cells.
Lipid extraction. Lipids were extracted using a modification of the
method of Bligh and Dyer (38) as described (32). Phospholipids, free
fatty acids, and neutral lipids were separated by the method of Kaluzny
et al. (39) utilizing amino solid phase extraction (spe) chromatography
(32). Phospholipid recovery typically ranged between 95-98% as deter￾mined by using l-palmitoyl-2- [1- '4C] -arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos￾phorylcholine as an internal standard. Lipid fractions not used immedi￾ately were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform containing
0.01% BHT, covered with argon, and stored at -200C.
High performance liquid chromatography. Analytical HPLC was
performed by injecting isolated phospholipids (resuspended in chloro￾form) onto a silica column (Spherisorb, 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 Jim;
Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL) and eluting isocratically with a
mobile solvent of acetonitrile/methanol/water (79:8:13, vol/vol/vol)
at 1.0 ml/min. Preparative HPLC was performed by injecting the total
lipid extract onto a silica column (Adsorbosphere, 250 mm X 10 mm,
5 Mrm; Alltech Associates, Inc.) and eluting isocratically with either
acetonitrile/methanol/water (79:8:13, vol/vol/vol) or hexane/isopro￾panol/water (39:59:12, vol/vol/vol) at 5.0 ml/min. UV absorbance was
detected with a diode array detector (L-3000; Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) scanning from 200 to 350 nm. In some cases, fractions were
collected from the column under sterile conditions, dried to a residue
under nitrogen at 370C, and either resuspended in tissue culture medium
for monocyte adhesion/transmigration assays or analyzed by mass spec￾trometry.
Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Fast atom bombard￾ment spectra were obtained with a VG ZAB-SE instrument (VG Analyti￾cal, Manchester, United Kingdom) using an 11/250 data system; an 8-
kV acceleration potential; xenon bombarding gas at 8 kV and 1 mA;
and the instrument set at a mass resolution of 1,000 (M/AM, 10%
valley). Aliquots (1-2 tl) of lipid suspended in chloroform were ap￾plied to the static probe tip onto which had been placed 1-2 Il of m￾nitrobenzyl alcohol. Data were collected by scanning from mass to
charge ratio (m/z) 1,000 to 400 and an average spectrum was produced
from six to eight independent scans. The data were mass measured
using cesium iodide ion clusters for calibration. The mass accuracies of
authentic phospholipid standards under these conditions were typically
less than ±0.5 D.
Electrospray mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry
was performed with a PE SCIEX API III Biomolecular Mass Analyzer
(Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). Total lipid extracts from the equiv￾alent of 5 mg protein were separated by preparative HPLC and fractions
were dried and resuspended in 1 ml of 50% acetonitrile 0.1% formic
acid. Aliquots (20 Ml) were injected at a flow rate of 20 Il/min into
the ion source of the mass spectrometer which was scanning from m/z
150 to 1,000 (step size of 0.1 D, scan speed of 5 s). Signals were mass
measured by means of the multiply charged ion series from the separate
introduction of polypropylene glycol for calibration. Under standard
conditions the accuracy of these mass measurements is < ±0.05 D.
Selected ion chromatograms were produced by software supplied by PE
SCIEX.
Monocyte adhesion/transmigration assays. These studies were per￾formed essentially as described previously (7, 9, 10, 32). Briefly, for
monocyte adhesion assays human aortic endothelial cells were incubated
with test medium for 4 h at 37°C. A suspension of human monocytes
were added for 15 min and nonadherent monocytes were removed.
Bound monocytes were counted and expressed as monocytes/micro￾scopic field. For monocyte transmigration studies, cocultures were
treated with native LDL in the absence or presence of various test
compounds for 8-24 h at 37°C. The coculture supernatants were subse￾quently transferred to untreated cocultures and incubated for an addi￾tional 24 h. Test medium was removed and human monocytes were
added for 45-90 min at 37°C. Loosely adherent monocytes were re￾moved and cocultures were fixed. Subendothelial monocytes were enu￾merated under a magnification of 625. Data were analyzed using model
1 ANOVA.
Enzyme activity assays. PAF-AH activity was determined by using
2- [acetyl- 3H] PAF as a substrate. The [3H] -acetate generated after sn￾2 hydrolysis was separated from labeled substrate by solid phase extrac￾tion chromatography and quantitated by liquid scintillation as described
previously (40). Enzymic activity is expressed in micromoles hy￾drolyzed/min per milligram protein after appropriate corrections. PON
activity was determined using paraoxon as the substrate by measuring
the increase in the absorbance at 412 nm due to formation of 4-nitrophe￾nol. Activity was measured in 50 nM Tris/HCl buffers at pH 7.4 and
8.0, and in 50 nM glycine/NaOH at pH 10.5. The sample to be tested
was added to start the reaction and the increase in absorbance at 412
nm was recorded (33). The quantity of 4-nitrophenol formed was calcu￾lated from the molar extinction coefficients at pH 7.4, 8.0, and 10.5
which were 12,800 17,000, and 18,290 M- cm-', respectively. Blanks
contained substrate without the lipoprotein sample or enzyme. 1 U of
PON activity is defined as 1 nmol of 4-nitrophenol formed per min under
the above assay conditions. The enzyme activity was also measured in

addition of the enzyme solution or the lipoprotein samples and the
increase in absorbance at 270 nm was recorded. Blanks were included
to correct for the spontaneous hydrolysis of phenylacetate. Enzymatic

Enzyme inactivation and supplementation of HDL. For inactivation
of PON, HDL (1.0 mg/ml in PBS) was incubated with 3.0 mM EDTA
at 370C for 90 min with gentle mixing under argon. For inactivation of
PAF-AH, HDL was incubated with 3.0 mM PMSF as above. HDL was
subsequently reisolated in an ultracentrifuge or by using 100,000 mol
wt cut off Centricons. The effect of heat inactivation was tested by
incubating the enzyme solution at 560C for 10 min before the as￾say (41 ).
Other procedures. Measurement of cell protein content and those
of lipoproteins were performed by microtiter plate assay based on the
method of Lowry et al. (42).

Inactivation ofparaoxonase and PAF-acetylhydrolase in HDL.
HDL was pretreated with buffer, EDTA (3.0 mM), PMSF (3.0
mM), or both EDTA and PMSF for 90 min at 37TC. HDL
was reisolated and tested for paraoxonase/arylesterase activity,
PAF-AH activity, and the ability to prevent LDL modification in
a monocyte transmigration assay. The paraoxonase/arylesterase
activity associated with HDL was reduced from 6.50±0.22 U/
mg protein to 0.59±0.14 U/mg protein by EDTA but was not
affected by PMSF (Fig. 1 A). Conversely, EDTA had no effect
on the PAF-AH activity in HDL, but PMSF reduced PAF-AH
activity by 60% (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C illustrates the possible
interdependence of these two enzymes in HDL to prevent LDL
modification by artery wall cells. As shown previously (9, 35),
LDL modified by incubation with cocultures (LDL) induced
monocyte transmigration which was completely inhibited if
HDL was present during modification (LDL + HDL). Selective
inhibition of PON (LDL + EDTA-HDL) or PAF-AH (LDL
+ PMSF-HDL) partially decreased the ability of HDL to protect
against LDL modification and subsequent monocyte transmigra￾tion (Fig. 1 C). However, inactivation of both enzyme systems
by pretreatment of HDL with both EDTA and PMSF (LDL
+ EDTA/PMSF-HDL) resulted in an HDL preparation that
exhibited no protection against LDL modification. Similarly,
HDL which had been heated at 560C for 30 min to inactivate
PON could not completely protect against the modification of

Effect of paraoxonase on the biological activity of mildly

14 h. Regardless of the method used to produce MM-LDL,
treatment with PON reduced the ability of MM-LDL to induce
monocyte binding and transmigration. MM-LDL incubated in
the presence of the buffer in which PON was suspended (but
without PON) had no effect on monocyte adhesion induced by
MM-LDL (Fig. 2 B). Controls to which EDTA and PMSF were
added in the absence of lipoproteins had no effect on LDL
oxidation or biological activity. Similar results were obtained
with PON isolated from human and rabbit plasma both of which
produced a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
HPLC analysis ofmildly oxidized-LDL. Phospholipids from
LDL were analyzed before and after modification by incubation
for 24 h with cocultures of human artery wall cells. Phospholip￾ids extracted from MM-LDL possessed increased UV ab￾sorbance at 270 nm compared to unoxidized LDL from the
same donor (Fig. 3). As noted before (32), under these HPLC
conditions phosphatidylcholine (PC) elutes as a bimodal peak

peaks (PC-1) was decreased after mild oxidation. PC-1 was
enriched in arachidonic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine as
determined by the retention time of standard PAPC (which
coelutes with PC-1) and confirmed by gas chromatography￾mass spectrometry of fatty acid methyl esters produced from
phospholipids collected during elution of PC-1 and PC-2 (data
not shown). The increase in 270 nm absorbance was likely
due to the formation of carbonyl groups or conjugated trienes
associated with polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in LDL
phospholipids.
Since we have previously shown that oxidized phospholip￾ids in MM-LDL are responsible for its biological activity (10,
32, 43), we compared the HPLC chromatograms of phospholip￾ids isolated from coculture modified LDL before and after PON
treatment. Lipids were extracted from coculture conditioned
medium and phospholipids were isolated by solid phase extrac￾tion chromatography as described (32). Phospholipids were
suspended in chloroform and analyzed by normal phase analyti￾cal HPLC while scanning UV absorbance between 200 and
350 nm with a diode array detector. Fig. 4 displays HPLC
chromatograms of phospholipids from coculture modified LDL
at 235 and 270 nm before and after incubation with PON at
370C for 14 h. Treatment of CM-LDL with PON had little effect
on the 235 nm absorbance of phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4 A),
however, PON treatment greatly reduced the 270 nm-absorbing
material associated with CM-LDL phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4
B). These results indicate that PON may selectively recognize

Biological activity of oxidized synthetic phospholipids. As
described above, mild oxidation of LDL appears to decrease
the abundance of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids in
LDL. We, therefore, tested the ability of oxidized PAPC (Ox￾PAPC) to induce endothelial cells to bind monocytes. HPLC
analysis of Ox-PAPC revealed the presence of 235 nm ab￾sorbing material eluting at 7.0 min (data not shown), a variety
of 270 nm absorbing species eluting between 7.0 and 13.0 min,
and the presence of residual unoxidized PAPC (200 nm) eluting
at 8.0 min (Fig. 5 A). Under these HPLC conditions unoxidized
PAPC did not absorb at a wavelength greater than 223 nm and
was not active in increasing monocyte binding (data not
shown). HPLC fractions were collected from Ox-PAPC under
sterile conditions and tested individually for the ability to induce
endothelial cells to bind monocytes (Fig. 5 B). Fractions 11 and
12 induced a significant increase in monocyte binding, however,
fraction 7 which contained predominately 235 nm absorbing
material and fraction 8 which contained predominately unoxi￾dized PAPC did not cause a significant increase in monocyte
binding to endothelial cells (Fig. 5 B). A comparison of frac￾tions 8 and 11 by FAB-MS revealed that fraction 8 (Fig. 5
C) contained predominately residual unoxidized PAPC at m/z
783.0. The fractions containing bioactivity, fraction 11 (Fig. 5
D) and fraction 12, contained a mixture of ions ranging in m/
z from 815 to 879 separated by 16 D. These ions were weak
or nonexistent in fractions without biological activity and were
not detectable in fractions from unoxidized PAPC.
Effect ofparaoxonase on oxidized-PAPC. Ox-PAPC (1 mg)
was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mM calcium and
divided into two equal portions. One portion was treated as a
sham and the other portion was incubated with PON (5 tg/ml)
at 37°C for 14 h. The sham treated Ox-PAPC induced a signifi￾cant increase in monocyte binding to endothelial cells, however,
the same preparation after treatment with PON was without
biological activity (Fig. 6 A, P < 0.001). Phospholipids treated
under the same conditions were extracted and analyzed by FAB￾MS. Unoxidized PAPC (Fig. 6 B) contained a major ion at
m/z 782.8 corresponding to authentic PAPC (theoretical m/z
783.1). Ox-PAPC contained some residual unoxidized PAPC
(m/z 782.8) but, in addition, contained ions of greater mass
than that of authentic PAPC at m/z 830.8 and m/z 846.8 (Fig.
6 C). These ions were likely derived from PAPC and repre￾2886 Watson, Berliner, Hama, La Du, Faull, Fogelman, and Navab

Figure 6. Effect of paraoxonase on Ox-PAPC. Authentic PAPC was allowed to autoxidize for 24 h at room temperature. The lipid residue was
resuspended in PBS with 10 mM calcium and divided between two test tubes. Purified rabbit PON (5 tg/ml) was added to one tube and the other
was incubated in parallel as a sham for 16 h at 37TC. RAEC were incubated with no additive (Control), sham-treated oxidized PAPC (Ox-PAPC).

sented M + H+ + 48.0 and M + H+ + 64.0, due to the addition
of three and four oxygen atoms, respectively, to PAPC. After
treatment with PON (5 Mtg/ml) for 14 h at 370C the higher
molecular weight ions were completely absent (Fig. 6 D).
These results indicated that paraoxonase destroyed phospholip￾ids containing multioxygenated PUFA.
Mass spectrometry ofMM-LDL. Lipids were extracted from
coculture modified LDL and native LDL from the same donor
and analyzed by preparative HPLC. Three fractions were col￾lected that encompassed the region of biological activity evident
in Fig. 5. Fraction 2 contained - 80% of the biological activity
(i.e., induction of monocyte binding) (data not shown). Each
fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of solvent and 20 pl was
injected sequentially into an electrospray mass spectrometer.
Reconstructed selected ion monitoring was then conducted to
determine the relative abundance of ions with m/z 831 and 847.
The signal from each fraction (1 through 3) in N-LDL (Fig. 5
A) were subtracted from respective fractions in MM-LDL (Fig.
5 B) and the differential chromatogram shown in Fig. 5 C (MM￾LDL minus N-LDL). The total abundance of these ions in the
fractions from MM-LDL (Fig. 5 B) was approximately three
times that seen in native LDL (Fig. 5 A). The ion with m/z
831 showed a distribution that paralleled the biological activity
in the three fractions. The ion with m/z 847 was present in
approximately equal abundance in fractions 1 and 2. Since the
biological activity of fraction 1 was less than that of fraction
2, the data suggest that most of the biological activity may have
been associated with the ion with m/z 831 that eluted in fraction
2. Similar results were obtained from analysis for oxidized ara￾chidonic acid-containing phospholipids with stearic acid at the
sn-i position (data not shown). These data, taken together,
strongly suggest that oxygenated phospholipids contribute to
the biological activity of MM-LDL.

Figure 7. Presence of m/z 831 and 847 ions in MM-LDL. Lipids were extracted from LDL before (N-LDL) and after (MM-LDL) incubation with
human artery wall cells in Ham's FlO medium for 8 h at 37TC. Lipids were separated by preparative HPLC and three identical fractions were
collected in the period during which biologically active phospholipids were eluting (see Fig. 5 A). Each of the three fractions was injected
sequentially into the mass spectrometer spaced by an interval sufficiently long for the ion count from the previous injection to return to baseline.
Reconstituted selected ion chromatograms were produced from the series of injections of native LDL fractions (A) and MM-LDL fractions (B) for
m/z = 831 and 847. Computer software was used to create differential reconstructed ion chromatograms of m/z 831 and 847 for MM-LDL minus
N-LDL (C). All chromatograms were then smoothed for clarity. Rel. Int. (%), Relative height (%) relative to the highest peak of all panels.
fied lipoproteins. The results of this study provide several lines
of evidence suggesting that biologically active lipids in MM￾LDL are derived from arachidonic acid-containing phosphati￾dylcholine produced by oxidation. (a) We invariably observe
a selective decrease in the HPLC peak corresponding to arachi￾donic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine (PC-1) after mild
oxidation (Fig. 3). Based on this, the synthetic phospholipid
PAPC was used as a surrogate for the precursor of the biologi￾cally active lipid in MM-LDL in some experiments. (b) Oxi￾dized PAPC induced endothelial cells to bind monocytes. (c)
By mass spectrometry of HPLC-isolated fractions (Fig. 5) we
found that two of the predominate ions present in the biologi￾cally active fractions of Ox-PAPC (m/z 831 and 847) were
also found in the biologically active fractions of MM-LDL
(Fig. 7).
The molecular mass of these phospholipids are consistent
with nonenzymatically formed, arachidonic acid-derived, eico￾sanoids at the sn-2 position of PAPC. Most of these eicosanoids
possess absorbance maxima in the 265-290 nm range, however
the precise molecular structure of the molecules present in our
FAB-MS spectra has not yet been determined. An example of
this phenomenon is phospholipid-bound F2-isoprostanes (m/z
831) which have been shown to be present in oxidized LDL
(43). Isoprostanes have also been shown to possess biological
activity on smooth muscle cells (44, 45). Initial studies in our
laboratory suggest that the free-acid form is active in inducing
monocyte binding to human aortic endothelial cells (data not
shown).
The mechanism by which PON protects against the action of
MM-LDL appears to be associated with destruction of oxidized
phospholipids in MM-LDL. PON destroyed multioxygenated
PAPC molecules (Fig. 6 D) in Ox-PAPC and decreased the
amount of 270 nm absorbance of phospholipids in MM-LDL
(Fig. 4). To account for both of these observations we would
hypothesize that the substrate for PON is an arachidonic acid￾containing phospholipid to which three to four oxygens have
been added in an orientation that alters the spectral absorbance
of the molecule. The presence of 270 nm absorbance may be
the result of the formation of carbonyl groups or the addition
of hydroxyl or hydroperoxyl groups at the 5 and 12 carbons of
arachidonic acid forming a conjugated triene structure charac￾teristic of leukotrienes. Any of these compounds may decom￾pose to form short chain acyl residues at the sn-2 position such
as 5-oxovalerate which have been shown to be biologically
active (46) and are substrates for PAF-AH (47, 48). Thus it
is possible that both phospholipids containing oxygenated and
cyclized arachidonic acid as well as fragmentation products
of arachidonic acid represent biologically active lipids. Initial
analyses of Ox-PAPC by liquid chromatography-mass spec￾trometry indicate that both fragmented PAPC and the multioxy￾2888 Watson, Berliner, Hama, La Du, Faull, Fogelman, and Navab

Further oxidation with decomposition of biologically
active compound in MM-LDL and generation of
biologically active compounds in highly oxidized LDL
genated PAPC molecules reported here are present in some
fractions that induce monocyte-endothelial interactions (data
not shown). A method of complete separation of these two
lipid classes is being developed.
The current and past (32) studies from our group suggest
that both PAF-AH and paraoxonase can destroy active lipids in
MM-LDL and that their effects are additive. Several lines of
evidence suggest that there are differences in the action of the
two enzymes. In addition, during copper-induced oxidation of
LDL, PAF-AH inhibits apolipoprotein Bloo modification and
conjugated diene formation but has no effect on thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances (TBARS) (reference 49 and Prescott,
Figure 8. Hypothetical model for
the mechanism by which HDL de￾stroys biologically active lipids in
MM-LDL. Reactive oxygens spe￾cies may be formed in the artery
wall (A) in areas sequestered from
plasma antioxidants by a variety
of possible mechanisms, some of
which may involve cyclooxygen￾ase, lipoxygenase, inducible nitric
oxide synthase, cytochrome P450,
mitochondrial respiration, or free
iron (B). These oxygen radicals
may then "seed" LDL within the
subendothelial space by oxidation
of phospholipids in LDL (C).
This process involves abstraction
of hydrogen atoms from bis-al￾lylic methylenes (D). Addition of
molecular oxygen at multiple sites
may generate multi-oxygenated
phospholipids (E) which may be
substrates for PON in HDL (F).
In cases where PON concentra￾tions are low or depleted or where
lipid peroxide levels are exces￾sive, oxidized phospholipids may
undergo oxidative fragmentation
(G) to form molecules (H) which
evoke the characteristic inflam￾matory responses in endothelial
cells induced by MM-LDL. These
oxidatively fragmented phospho￾lipids may then be substrates for
the second line of defence, PAF￾AH (I). PAF-AH hydrolyzes
these biologically active lipids
into molecules which do not
evoke the characteristics inflam￾matory responses in endothelial
cells induced by MM-LDL. Fur￾ther oxidative decomposition of
lipids in LDL, including choles￾teryl esters, leads to the deposition
of highly oxidized LDL (J) pres￾ent in the necrotic core of ad￾vanced atherosclerotic lesion. EC,

S. M., personal communication) however, PON inhibits both
the production of lipoperoxides and TBARS (31). Treatment
of MM-LDL with PAF-AH resulted in a decrease in 234 nm
absorbance (reference 32, Fig. 5), while PON had no effect on
234 nm absorbance but resulted in a decrease in 270 nm ab￾sorbance (Fig. 4). Furthermore, PAF-AH has been shown to
act on molecules with nine carbons or less at the sn-2 position
(46) while PON has been shown in the current study to act on
derivatives with longer chains.
The experiments shown in Fig. 1 represent an HDL prepara￾tion in which PON and PAF-AH activities made approximately
equal contributions to the protection afforded by HDL. In the
Paraoxonase Inhibits the Effect of Mildly Oxidized LDL 2889

course of these studies we have observed that the protection
afforded by HDL taken from some subject is more dependent
on PON activity and in others more depended on PAF-AH
activity. We have measured the ratio of activity of PAF-AH/
PON in 20 HDL preparations and have found considerable
variance in the ratios obtained in HDL from different individu￾als (data not shown). Based on data from our laboratory and
others we propose the hypothetical model shown in Fig. 8 which
illustrates that phospholipids with both long and short chains
at the sn-2 positions may induce monocyte-endothelial interac￾tions. PAF-AH can hydrolyze the short chain derivative while
PON hydrolyzes long chain derivatives.
Changes in PON activity may occur independently of
changes in HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A-I (29). In the
current study we have shown that treatment of MM-LDL with
PON and HDL-associated esterase for 14 h inhibited its ability
to induce monocyte-endothelial interactions. Incubating MM￾LDL in a test tube with HDL for 14 h also reduced the ability
of the MM-LDL to induce monocyte-endothelial interactions
but shorter coincubation times of HDL with MM-LDL (< 6 h)
like those used previously (9) were not sufficient to destroy the
biological activity (data not shown). We previously reported
(9) that phospholipid liposomes (but not purified apo Al) pre￾vented the biological activity of coculture modified LDL. Since
these liposomes did not contain either PON or PAF-AH before
addition to the cocultures the possibility exists that these lipo￾somes served as a sink for the biologically active lipids of the
kind shown in Fig. 8. These lipids may have been sequestered
in the liposomes in such as way as to prevent their interaction
with the coculture cells in a manner necessary to trigger the
expression of the genes that induce monocyte binding and mi￾gration. The protective effect of HDL may not be dependent
on the absolute levels of HDL cholesterol in the blood but
rather the abundance of HDL particles which contain protective
enzymes relative to the concentration of oxidized LDL proxi￾mate to the artery wall cells. This ratio is determined by both
genetic and environmental factors. Genetic determinants may
include plasma levels and isoforms of PON and PAF-AH. Envi￾ronmental influences may include factors that augment the accu￾mulation of LDL in the subendothelial space (e.g., hypercholes￾terolemia and apolipoprotein [a]) as well as factors which in￾crease oxidative stress (e.g., smoking and diabetes). The
findings presented herein could, in part, help to explain why
some individuals with low LDL/HDL ratios experience clinical
events while other individuals with high LDL/HDL ratios live
free from clinical events resulting from vascular disease.
