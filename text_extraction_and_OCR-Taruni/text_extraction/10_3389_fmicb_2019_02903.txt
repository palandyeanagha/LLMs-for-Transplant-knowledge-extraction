Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) present an increasing global burden in
immunocompromised and other seriously ill populations, including those caused
by pathogens which are inherently resistant or less susceptible to antifungal drugs. Early
diagnosis encompassing accurate detection and identification of the causative agent
and of antifungal resistance is critical for optimum patient outcomes. Many molecular￾based diagnostic approaches have good clinical utility although interpretation of results
should be according to clinical context. Where an IFD is in the differential diagnosis,
panfungal PCR assays allow the rapid detection/identification of fungal species directly
from clinical specimens with good specificity; sensitivity is also high when hyphae are
seen in the specimen including in paraffin-embedded tissue. Aspergillus PCR assays
on blood fractions have good utility in the screening of high risk hematology patients
with high negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 94 and
70%, respectively, when two positive PCR results are obtained. The standardization,
and commercialization of Aspergillus PCR assays has now enabled direct comparison
of results between laboratories with commercial assays also offering the simultaneous
detection of common azole resistance mutations. Candida PCR assays are not
as well standardized with the only FDA-approved commercial system (T2Candida)
detecting only the five most common species; while the T2Candida outperforms blood
culture in patients with candidemia, its role in routine Candida diagnostics is not well
defined. There is growing use of Mucorales-specific PCR assays to detect selected
genera in blood fractions. Quantitative real-time Pneumocystis jirovecii PCRs have
replaced microscopy and immunofluorescent stains in many diagnostic laboratories
although distinguishing infection may be problematic in non-HIV-infected patients. For
species identification of isolates, DNA barcoding with dual loci (ITS and TEF1α) offer

INTRODUCTION
Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) pose a significant threat to
human health, particularly in the immunocompromised, with
an increasing global burden in solid organ and bone marrow
transplant recipients, cancer patients, those with HIV, and those
being treated with immunomodulators. The most common
causes of IFD are Candida spp., followed by Aspergillus spp.;
other pathogens such as Cryptococcus spp., the Mucorales,
and Pneumocystis accounting for varying frequency of IFDs
depending on geographic region and patient population (Brown
et al., 2012). Despite advances in antifungal therapy, mortality
rates from IFD are substantial but vary with infection. Increased
prevalence, in particular of Candida glabrata infections including
those due to azole-resistant, or echinocandin-azole co-resistant
isolates, as well as multi-azole resistant Candida tropicalis isolates
has been noted (Pfaller et al., 2012; Chapman et al., 2017). Of
added concern is the global emergence of multi-drug resistant
fungal species, including Candida auris (Desoubeaux et al., 2018),
pan-azole resistant Aspergillus fumigatus driven by agricultural
triazole use (Snelders et al., 2009; van der Linden et al.,
2013; Navalkele et al., 2017), as well as rare molds which are
often resistant to most if not all antifungal drugs (Malani and
Kauffman, 2007; Dellière et al., 2019).
Early diagnosis of IFD including accurate identification of the
causative fungus and where possible, of antifungal resistance,
is critical for appropriate patient management and improving
outcomes. While culture and microscopy remain the gold
standard for IFD diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity of such
methods are limited; cultures are slow (up to 4 weeks) and
dependent on the specimen containing viable fungal elements.
Fungi with environmentally and clinically acquired antifungal
resistance are emerging, and cryptic species with intrinsic
resistances may be missed. Therefore, there is a need for more
sensitive and targeted diagnostic systems for IFD, to not only
directly detect fungal species in clinical specimens, but also
for more rapid detection of drug resistance. This article will
focus on modern molecular diagnostic approaches to directly
detect fungi in clinical specimens, and in the characterization
of cultured fungi including their drug resistance profiles, with
discussion on newer approaches including DNA barcoding and
next generation sequencing (NGS). The review presents these
approaches in the relevant clinical context, offers a broad view
of where they may be positioned in a diagnostic laboratory,
and concludes with the challenges that may be faced with wider
implementation of molecular tests in an era where their use is
envisaged to increase. As such, the consensus definitions for IFD
from the European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer/Mycoses Special Interest Group (EORTC/MSG) have
recently been updated to include some of the tests described here
(Donnelly et al., 2019).
DIRECT DETECTION OF FUNGI IN
CLINICAL SPECIMENS
Molecular assays for the direct detection of fungal DNA in
clinical specimens comprise either broad range (or panfungal)
assays to capture “all fungi” or those tailored to detect specific
genera or species. While increasingly used, their position in
routine diagnostics will vary according to clinical context.
Further, commercialization of assays has led to standardized
methodologies, facilitating large scale “real world” clinical
validation for routine clinical use (Zhang, 2013). The utility
and challenges associated with both broad range and targeted
genus-specific approaches are discussed in detail below.
Panfungal PCR Assays
These assays detect “all” fungal DNA present in a clinical
specimen through the use of universal fungal primers. The
preferred target(s) are one or more regions of the rRNA
gene cluster – the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1
and ITS2) and the D1/D2 regions of the 28S rRNA gene
(Figure 1; White et al., 1990). Amplification is most often
followed by DNA sequencing but high-resolution melt curve
analysis in real-time PCR assays is increasingly used (Bezdicek
et al., 2016; Valero et al., 2016). Together, these assays have
successfully detected and identified fungi from diverse specimen
types including fresh tissue, formalin fixed paraffin embedded
(FFPE) tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), vitreous fluid, blood,
and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (Lau et al., 2007;
Landlinger et al., 2010; Bezdicek et al., 2016; Rahn et al.,
2016; Rickerts, 2016; Valero et al., 2016; Gomez et al., 2017;
Zeller et al., 2017; Sabino et al., 2019) with good accuracy and
specificity though with varying sensitivity between specimen
types. One study reported the best results when performed on
sterile fluid specimens (including blood, CSF, and aspirates)
with a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV),
and positive predictive value (PPV) of 100, 96, 100, and 86%,
respectively, but these values decreased to 90, 75, 86, and
82% from BALF (Zeller et al., 2017). An added advantage
of such assays is that unexpected and novel pathogens may
be identified. A prospective study of blood specimens from
hematological patients at high risk for IFD reported 44.4%
(8/18) of positive samples were identified as less common
non-Aspergillus and non-Candida fungi including Fusarium

spp., Scedosporium apiospermum, and various mucormycetes
(Sugawara et al., 2013). In another study, panfungal PCR was able
to provide an unexpected diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis in a
patient with osteosarcoma (Komatsu et al., 2004).
Gomez et al. (2017) investigated the diagnostic accuracy and
clinical impact of an in-house panfungal sequence-based PCR
assay in patients with a proven or suspected IFD. In patients
with proven IFD (n = 60), the sensitivity and specificity were 96.6
and 98.2%, respectively, with similar assay sensitivities between
different specimen types: 100% from both fresh tissue (n = 25)
and sterile body fluids (n = 15), and 90% (18/20) from FFPE
tissue. In patients with suspected IFD (n = 116), the diagnostic
yield of the assay was 62.9% for all patients and 71.3% in
patients with proven IFD. The sensitivity and diagnostic yield
from this study are higher than reported by others (Lau et al.,
2007; Rickerts et al., 2011; Trubiano et al., 2016) since testing
was restricted to those specimens with visible fungal elements
on histopathology, thereby increasing the pre-test probability of a
positive result. Of note, the diagnostic yield was further improved
in tissue specimens collected by open resection compared with
core-needle biopsy and fine-needle aspiration highlighting the
importance of evaluating sample volume adequacy to exclude
false negative results. In addition, the inclusion of a human
gene target such as β-actin as a DNA extraction control is
essential (Gomez et al., 2017). The recently revised EORTC/MSG
criteria for diagnosis of IFD from tissue specimens recommends
the amplification of fungal DNA by PCR combined by DNA
sequencing only when fungal elements are seen by histopathology
(Donnelly et al., 2019).
Conversely, the interpretation of panfungal PCR results
performed on non-sterile samples, particularly BALF, is more
difficult (Halliday et al., 2015; Bezdicek et al., 2016; Rahn
et al., 2016; Trubiano et al., 2016; Wehrle-Wieland et al., 2018).
A positive result returned on BALF may indicate lung infection
but also airway colonization or environmental contamination
especially if non-pathogenic fungal species are detected. Indeed,
in two studies, the most abundant species detected in BALF
were Candida spp. (25–40%), followed by Saccharomyces spp.
and Rhodotorula spp. (4–5% each) (Rahn et al., 2016; Trubiano
et al., 2016). Sequencing the PCR product may also result in
a mixed “signal” due to multiple fungal species being present
(Bezdicek et al., 2016; Zeller et al., 2017); this can be partially
overcome by post PCR high-resolution melt curve analysis rather
than using sequencing (Bezdicek et al., 2016). The sensitivity of
panfungal PCR on BALF is lower in patients receiving mold￾active treatment (Trubiano et al., 2016; Wehrle-Wieland et al.,
2018). While panfungal PCR on BALF has the potential to
identify more fungal species than culture, a study by Bousbia et al.
(2012) reported more episodes of pneumonia were diagnosed by
culture (42%) than by molecular methods (17%).
From collective experience, it is clear that panfungal PCR has
good utility where fungal elements are seen in fresh tissue and
FFPE tissue by histopathological examination (i.e., proven IFD)
(Donnelly et al., 2019) or where fungal hyphae/yeast forms are
seen in sterile body fluids. Under these circumstances, panfungal
PCR combined with DNA sequencing will strongly value add
to the diagnosis by identifying the causative pathogen(s).
The identity of the fungus should be consistent with the
histopathologic or microscopic findings.
Where an IFD is in the differential diagnosis with a highly
suggestive clinical picture, but where fungal forms are not
visualized in the clinical specimen, e.g., to screen blood of

Kidd et al. Molecular Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Disease
patients at high risk for IFD, expert opinion suggests that
panfungal PCR has good potential to assist with diagnosis by
augmenting culture methods, although a negative result does not
exclude diagnosis. This may be especially relevant in patients
already receiving antifungal therapy (Trubiano et al., 2016;
Ala-Houhala et al., 2018).
Until recently, a potential drawback of panfungal PCR
methods was the lack of standardization of assays for comparison
of results in the clinical trial or study context. The Fungal PCR
Initiative (FPCRI) working group of the International Society for
Human and Animal Mycoses (ISHAM) is currently designing
and optimizing protocols to evaluate PCR methods to detect
fungi from tissue specimens1
. That acknowledged the use of such
assays for routine patient care is often helpful in diagnosis and
should be considered in the diagnostic algorithm of any patient
with suspected IFD to reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis or
missed diagnosis (Ullmann et al., 2018).
Aspergillus PCR
For many years, the test performance of PCR-based assays for the
diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) has varied substantively
due to differences in methodology, sample type and volume,
DNA extraction protocols, gene targets, differences in criteria to
define “PCR positivity,” and reference standards to rule in, or
rule out, infection (White et al., 2010a). Many of these studies
focused on the use of Aspergillus PCR for the early or pre-emptive
diagnosis of IA, i.e., in the screening of high risk hematology
patients for IA. To this end, there have been a number of meta￾analyses addressing these issues in Aspergillus PCR performance
(Mengoli et al., 2009; Cruciani et al., 2015). A Cochrane library
meta-analysis of PCR-based studies on blood specimens for
early detection and diagnosis of IA (i.e., screening for infection)
reported a mean sensitivity and specificity of 80.5% (95% CI
72.9–86.3%) and 78.5% (67.8–86.4%), respectively, for a single
positive PCR result, and 57.9% (36.5–76.8%) and 96.2% (89.6–
98.6%) for two positive PCR results (Cruciani et al., 2015).
Assuming a mean prevalence of IA of 13% in a particular patient
population, the PPV of Aspergillus PCR increased from 36 to 70%
when two positive results were used to define a “PCR positive”
episode, while the NPV remained at 96 to 94%. The high NPV
of Aspergillus PCR allows IA to be ruled out in the presence of a
negative test result with little need for empiric antifungal therapy
(Cruciani et al., 2015; Pasqualotto and Falci, 2016). These results
were confirmed in a large prospective study to determine the
efficacy of PCR screening for early diagnosis of IA in 213 high
risk patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
or chemotherapy for acute leukemia (Springer et al., 2016a). In
antifungal drug-naïve patients, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
and NPV of PCR were 71.4, 92.3, 62.5, and 98.3%, respectively.
However, the PPV decreased to only 5.4% (the NPV rose to 100%)
in patients receiving Aspergillus-active prophylaxis, suggesting
the role of screening by PCR is best applied to patients not
receiving primary anti-mold prophylaxis (Springer et al., 2016a).
To harmonize test performance between studies, the European
Aspergillus PCR Initiative (EAPCRI) Working Group of ISHAM
1www.fpcri.eu
has standardized Aspergillus PCR methodology for analytical
performance and clinical validity2
. Laboratories performing
Aspergillus PCR should employ these recommendations when
performing PCR in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma (White
et al., 2010a,b, 2011, 2015; Loeffler et al., 2015); validation of
similar standardized processes using BALF is underway (Barnes
et al., 2018). Although data are lacking for validation of CSF,
urine, and tissue samples, it is likely that the same principles and
critical steps will apply (i.e., sample volume ≥ 0.5 mL and elution
volume < 100 µL) (White et al., 2010a; Barnes et al., 2018).
Debate is ongoing as to whether WB, serum, or plasma
specimens should be used for screening or to diagnose IA
by PCR (Buchheidt et al., 2017). Processing of serum or
plasma, compared with WB, is technically less demanding as it
facilitates automated processing, requires less standardization,
and has reduced risk of contamination (White et al., 2011,
2015; Loeffler et al., 2015). A study that applied EAPCRI￾standardized methodologies to evaluate all three blood fractions
(423 WB, 583 plasma, and 419 serum) found that for all
samples, PCR positivity was associated with cases of IA (plasma,
P = 0.0019; serum, P = 0.0049; and WB, P = 0.0089). Plasma
PCR generated the highest sensitivity (91%) compared with
serum (80%) and WB (55%); however, the specificity for WB
(96%) was significantly higher than those of serum (69%,
P = 0.0238) or plasma (53%, P = 0.0002) (Springer et al.,
2016b). Further combining PCR testing of different blood
fractions allowed IA to be both excluded and diagnosed. Testing
of plasma provides similar diagnostic utility to WB while
allowing utilization of commercial automated DNA extraction
processes more suited to routine laboratories (Loeffler et al.,
2015; Springer et al., 2016b). It is noteworthy that Aspergillus
PCR has been included as a mycologic criterion for probable
IA in the revised EORTC/MSG definitions (Donnelly et al.,
2019). The EAPCRI have recommended that Aspergillus genus￾specific PCR assays targeting the rRNA genes are preferred
for reliably detecting A. fumigatus at low DNA concentrations
but thus far do not recommend a specific quantitative PCR
(Morton et al., 2017).
For pragmatic reasons, it is reasonable for clinical mycology
laboratories to test one blood fraction rather than two with the
above caveat in mind. On balance, because the use of plasma lends
itself to automated DNA extraction, this work-flow advantage is
suited to busy clinical laboratories without compromising test
performance. Sample volume (≥0.5 mL of plasma) and elution
volume (<100 µL) are both critical.
Other than screening for early IA, the use of PCR to
detect Aspergillus DNA in other clinical specimens (e.g.,
BALF, CSF, and tissue) for diagnosis in patients suspected
to have IA has also been useful. However, as for panfungal
PCR, BALF-PCR cannot distinguish colonization from IA
resulting in relatively low PPV of around 72% (even lower
in non-hematology patients) (Arvanitis and Mylonakis, 2015).
Consequently, the use of PCR to diagnose IA and CNS
aspergillosis or meningitis from BALF and CSF, respectively,
is only moderately recommended by the European Society

for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECSMID),
European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM), and
European Respiratory Society (ERC) joint guidelines (Ullmann
et al., 2018); however, a negative PCR result is useful to
exclude IA (Heng et al., 2014). The added inherent variability of
BALF sampling procedures means that quantification of fungal
burden by PCR cannot be interpreted meaningfully (Buchheidt
et al., 2017). One study (Imbert et al., 2018) reported that
determining fungal load by PCR in BALF allowed discrimination
between aspergillosis and non-aspergillosis pathologies (i.e.,
contamination), but not between invasive and non-invasive
forms. Several meta-analyses using PCR on BALF IA diagnosis
reported overall sensitivities and specificities > 90% (Sun et al.,
2011; Avni et al., 2012) and if EORTC/MSG criteria were
strictly applied, the sensitivity and specificity were 77 and
94%, respectively (Avni et al., 2012). As for blood, antifungal
treatment before bronchoscopy significantly reduced sensitivity
(Avni et al., 2012).
Aspergillus PCR assays therefore have established utility in
screening for early infection in high risk patients as well as
being used in the diagnosis of established infection in real time.
Greater clinical application may in the near future be realized
by the growing number of commercial PCR assays to detect
Aspergillus DNA in clinical specimens, providing standardized
methodology, and quality control of the reagents (see Table 1).
While the sensitivity and specificity of commercial assays are
encouraging, data evaluating their clinical utility and head-to￾head comparisons are relatively limited (Danylo et al., 2014;
Chong et al., 2015; White et al., 2017b; Barnes et al., 2018;
White, 2019). A recent review of commercial assays for the
detection of Aspergillus spp. reported significantly lower
sensitivities and specificities in serum specimens than respiratory
specimens. Only the MycAssay AspergillusR
(Microgen
Bioproducts Ltd., Camberley, United Kingdom) and the
AsperGeniusR
(PathoNostics, Maastricht, Netherlands) assays
were recommended for routine testing of respiratory samples
(Rath and Steinmann, 2018), although the MycAssay Aspergillus
is no longer commercially available. No recommendations were
made for routine testing of serum specimens using commercial
assays. Some assays simultaneously detect both Aspergillus DNA
and the most prevalent CYP51A gene mutations responsible for
azole resistance in A. fumigatus, differentiating wild type from
resistant strains (see section “Molecular Detection of Antifungal
Drug Resistance”).
PCR for Invasive Candidiasis
Definitive treatment of invasive candidiasis (IC), encompassing
candidemia and deep-seated candidiasis, is often delayed by the
insensitivity of culture with high mortality (35–75%) (Fortún
et al., 2012). Blood cultures are sensitive at detecting viable
Candida cells, with a limit of detection of ≤ 1 colony forming unit
(CFU)/mL, but their overall sensitivity across the spectrum of IC
is only ∼50% and they have a lag time for identification of up to
5 days (Pfeiffer et al., 2011; Clancy and Nguyen, 2013). Time to
initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy and to source control
are critical determinants of survival (Clancy and Nguyen, 2018a).
The high sensitivity of PCR-based assays, detecting < 5 CFU/mL,
makes these appealing for early diagnosis of IC, particularly

Kidd et al. Molecular Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Disease
those cases of IC that are missed by culture (Pfeiffer et al., 2011;
Clancy and Nguyen, 2013), yet the position of Candida PCR
assays in the diagnostic algorithm of IC is not as clear as that
of Aspergillus PCR (discussed above), and its use will differ in
different clinical contexts.
A major impediment to clinical application has been lack of
standardization, variable analytical sensitivity, and the need for
nucleic acid extraction and purification from clinical samples
(Pfaller and Castanheira, 2016). Numerous DNA extraction
methods and use of various gene targets [predominantly rDNA
sequences and cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase
(L1A1) gene], PCR formats (single and multiplex, nested, and
real-time PCR assays), both in-house and commercial, have
been evaluated for the rapid diagnosis of IC (Arvanitis et al.,
2014). These differences in methodologies and case definitions
have limited comparison between studies. Most Candida PCR
data have been sourced using WB or blood fractions with
reported high sensitivities (80–100%), specificities (90–100%),
and NPVs (88–100%) for those species targeted. This suggests
that PCR-based assays may be more useful in excluding, rather
than establishing, the diagnosis of IC (Arvanitis et al., 2014;
Fortún et al., 2014). However, the clinical utility of these
assays is uncertain due to their limited validation in real-life
prospective settings.
A meta-analysis of 54 Candida PCR studies (>4600 patients)
reported pooled sensitivities and specificities for detecting
candidemia of 95 and 92%, respectively, with results available
up to four weeks earlier than standard culture or clinical signs
of IC (Avni et al., 2011). In patients with probable IC, the
positivity rate of PCR was 85% compared with 38% for blood
cultures. The specificity was > 90% for the same patients but
decreased among Candida-colonized controls. Improved test
performance was associated with the use of WB (rather than
serum) and using a PCR targeting a Candida-specific part of the
rDNA or cytochrome P450 genes with an in vitro detection limit
of ≤ 10 CFU/mL. For blood specimens, studies using real-time
PCR and species-specific probes have shown the best results. For
IC caused by both Candida albicans and non-C. albicans species,
McMullan et al. (2008) reported sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
NPVs of 87, 100, 100, and 99.6%, respectively, for the six species
detected (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida
dubliniensis, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei).
PCR performance data for forms of IC other than candidemia
are relatively limited – for intra-abdominal candidiasis, PCR
sensitivities of 86–91% have been reported for the species
targeted, but specificity varies widely (33–97%) (Nguyen et al.,
2012; Fortún et al., 2014; León et al., 2016; Clancy and Nguyen,
2018b). Nguyen et al. (2012) found a Candida real-time PCR
assay to be more sensitive than the FungitellR
1,3-β-D glucan
(BDG) assay (Associates of Cape Cod, United States) for
diagnosis of all IC (80 versus 56%) as well as deep seated (blood
culture negative) candidiasis (89 versus 53%). Both PCR and
BDG were more sensitive than blood cultures for diagnosis
of deep-seated candidiasis (sensitivities of 88, 62, and 17%,
respectively). However, if blood culture was combined with
either PCR or BDG, the sensitivities increased to 98 and 79%,
respectively. Data on the application of Candida PCR assays
are almost exclusively limited to blood specimens; however,
it was recently reported to be useful in the diagnosis of
Candida meningitis, which has a poor yield from CSF culture
(Herrera et al., 2019).
A number of commercial PCR-based diagnostic methods are
now available for IC (Table 2). Generally, these assays target
the five most common pathogenic Candida species (C. albicans,

Kidd et al. Molecular Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Disease
C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis) which
account for > 95% of IC. Many of these assays remain
investigational as they have not been validated for diagnosing
IC in multi-center studies, nor is there evidence that any one
commercial test is superior. The choice of adopting an in
house rather than commercial assay is dependent upon workflow
and capacity in individual testing laboratories and cost (Clancy
and Nguyen, 2018b), and results should be considered with
caution. To date, the T2Candida panel and the T2Dx instrument
(T2 Biosystems, United States) is the only platform approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to detect
Candida spp. in WB without the need for prior blood culture
or nucleic acid extraction steps. The platform combines nuclear
magnetic resonance and PCR technology for rapid (< 3 h),
accurate, sensitive (1–3 CFU/mL), and specific detection of
C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata/C. krusei
(Neely et al., 2013; Mylonakis et al., 2015). The subsequent T2
C. auris panel detects C. auris a limit of detection < 5 CFU/mL
from WB and skin swabs in under 5 h (Sexton et al., 2018).
In the initial multi-center trial of T2 Biosystems (DIRECT),
using spiked blood samples from hospitalized patients, the assay
had a sensitivity and specificity of 91.1 and 99.4%, respectively,
with a time to positivity of 4.4 ± 1 h (Mylonakis et al., 2015). In a
follow-up multi-center trial (DIRECT2) of hospitalized patients
with candidemia, the clinical sensitivity for the five species
identified by T2Candida was 89% as 32/36 patients with positive
companion blood cultures (cBCs) yielded positive T2Candida
results. T2Candida was significantly more likely to be positive
than cBCs (45 versus 24%, P < 0.0001) (Clancy et al., 2018).
Another study found T2Candida was clinically more effective
than blood culture for the management of suspected candidemia,
but slightly less effective than empiric therapy (Walker et al.,
2016). Prospective randomized controlled trials are required to
fully evaluate the impact of the T2Candida on patient outcomes
and hospital-associated costs. In a setting with a prevalence of
candidemia of 10%, the T2Candida is expected to have a PPV
and NPV of 84 and 99%, respectively; however, in low-prevalence
settings (0.4–1%), the PPV drops to an estimated 15–31% and
a positive result by itself would be unlikely to justify antifungal
treatment in a patient without identifiable risks or candidemia
(Clancy and Nguyen, 2018c; Zacharioudakis et al., 2018). The
performance of T2Candida in cases of deep-seated candidiasis
has not yet been evaluated.
From the above data, for established candidemia and IC,
Candida PCR has a higher sensitivity than blood culture but
remains best positioned for use in conjunction with blood
cultures and/or BDG testing. Candida PCR with its high NPV
value, however, lends itself as a potential tool to rule out IC in
high risk patients.
PCR Detection of Mucormycosis
Invasive fungal diseases caused by Mucorales fungi are
increasing, especially among immunocompromised patients and
in those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (Vallabhaneni
et al., 2017; Millon et al., 2019). The growing incidence
of mucormycosis can in part be attributed to changes in
antifungal protocols, particularly for the prevention of IA in
high risk groups. But in practice, the increasing use of molecular
techniques for the direct detection of Mucorales DNA in fresh
and FFPE tissue that are often culture negative has likely
led to an increase in diagnosed cases (Millon et al., 2019).
Diagnosis of mucormycosis remains challenging as clinical
features are non-specific and diagnosis often relies on standard
laboratory methods which are non-specific and insensitive.
Additionally, there are no commercially available serological tests
for Mucorales (Lackner et al., 2014).
Conventional and real-time PCR assays for the direct
detection of minute amounts of Mucorales DNA from fresh
or FFPE tissue, BALF, and serum have been reported with the
majority targeting the ITS, 18S, or 28S rDNA (Hammond et al.,
2011; Millon et al., 2013, 2015; Lackner et al., 2014; Springer
et al., 2016a,b; Gholinejad-Ghadi et al., 2018). The key to effective
molecular diagnosis, however, is efficient DNA extraction from
the clinical specimen. To date, PCR detection from fresh or
FFPE tissue has been the preferred method to identify the
causative mucormycete with sensitivities in FFPE tissue of 56–
91% (Springer et al., 2016b; Gholinejad-Ghadi et al., 2018).
Negative results from FFPE samples may be due to presence
of very small amounts of fungal DNA and/or cross-linking of
proteins and fragmentation of DNA during formalin fixation
(Gholinejad-Ghadi et al., 2018).
More recently, advances have been made in the detection of
Mucorales DNA by real-time qPCR in serum and on average, can
detect the pathogen 8 days (up to 24 days) earlier than histology
and/or culture and 3 days earlier than radiographic features such
as reverse halo signs on CT scans (Millon et al., 2013, 2015;
Caillot et al., 2016). Each of these studies used three qPCR
assays targeting 18S rDNA from Mucor/Rhizopus, Lichtheimia,
and Rhizomucor species. Not unexpectedly the sensitivity of
qPCR on serum decreased upon receipt of active antifungal
therapy (Ambisome alone or in combination with posaconazole)
(Caillot et al., 2016). Springer et al. (2016b) recently determined
the clinical value of screening serum samples (n = 268) from
35 high risk patients using a Mucorales-specific real-time PCR
assay; an additional step of sequencing is required to identify the
genus. Mucorales DNA was detected in sera from all patients
with probable/proven (n = 5) and in 29% of patients (5/17)
with possible mucormycosis. A screening approach would have
enabled earlier diagnosis (up to 21 days) and targeted treatment
in 80% of probable/proven cases.
qPCR detection of Mucorales DNA in BALF is likewise
an attractive approach to aid the diagnosis of pulmonary
mucormycosis. In a study by Scherer et al. (2018), Mucorales
PCR was positive on BALF of all 10 patients with mucormycosis
(seven proven and three probable). For four of these patients,
PCR on BALF was the earliest available biological test revealing
mucormycosis, and three of these four patients had already
been diagnosed with aspergillosis. Mucorales–Aspergillus mixed
infection is also thought to be more frequent than previously
described (Scherer et al., 2018). These results provide support
for Mucorales PCR on BALF to be included in the diagnostic
approach to pulmonary IFD, although it is still difficult to obtain
BALF in at risk hematology or ICU patients. A prospective
multi-center trial of molecular tools for the early diagnosis of

Kidd et al. Molecular Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Disease
mucormycosis is underway (ModiMucor [Projet Hospitalier de
Recherche Clinique] national-ModiMucor-French Ministry of
Health 2014-A00580-473
).
The overall low number of patients studied and lack of
standardization and thorough clinical evaluation of these in￾house PCR assays means they cannot be recommended as
stand-alone diagnostic tests they are valuable add-on tools that
complement histology and culture (Cornerly et al., 2014; Lackner
et al., 2014). The ISHAM FPCRI Mucorales Lab working group
has been established to improve standardization and provide
recommendations for Mucorales PCR (Millon et al., 2019). The
recent development of a commercial real-time PCR assay for
the detection of the clinically relevant Mucorales species by
PathoNostics (Maastricht, Netherlands) should also assist the
standardization of Mucorales PCR. This assay enables direct
detection of pan-Mucorales DNA, Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp.,
Lichtheimia spp., Cunninghamella spp., and Rhizomucor spp. in
respiratory tract samples and fresh and FFPE tissue within 3.5 h
(Gaajetaan et al., 2018). It is currently available for “research use
only” purposes.
Of note, the recent discovery of the gene family of spore
coating encoding proteins (CotH) offers a novel potential
diagnostic target. CotH genes are multi-copy and are universally
and uniquely present in Mucorales fungi, allowing them to
penetrate host cells. Baldin et al. (2018) investigated whether
a CotH-specific PCR assay could detect DNA from a variety
of Murorales species and genera (Lichtheimia corymbifera,
Rhizopus delemar, Rhizopus arrhizus, Mucor circinelloides,
and Cunninghamella bertholletiae) in various biological fluids
(plasma, urine, and BALF) in mice. CotH DNA was detected
with 100% specificity from all fluids within 24 h of infection but
was more consistently detected in urine (90% sensitivity) than in
plasma or BALF. PCR was also successful from urine samples of
four patients with proven mucormycosis, showing the potential
of CotH genes as a biomarker for this and warranting validation
on larger numbers of human samples (Baldin et al., 2018).
Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR
PCR-based assays for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia (PCP) undoubtedly are more sensitive than
histological and microscopic identification of asci and
trophic forms in tissue, BALF, and induced sputum (IS) by
conventional staining or by immunofluorescence microscopy
(White et al., 2017a). Numerous comparative studies have
been published (beyond the scope of this review); however,
a recent comparison shows an in-house qPCR method had
sensitivity of 82.9% compared to 60.0% for the monoclonal
immunofluorescence assay by the MonoFluoTM P. jirovecii
IFA test kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) with
similar specificity (>99%) (Desoubeaux et al., 2017). For
pragmatic purposes, for more rapid TATs and because of
steady loss of microscopy skills in the mycology laboratory, an
increasing number of laboratories are turning to Pneumocystis
PCR assays. However, as PCR may detect colonization,
asymptomatic infection, subclinical infection, as well as
3https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02845934
active infection, this raises the issue of interpretation
of discordant results, e.g., between a PCR positive and
immunofluorescence negative sample, or indeed of any
“positive” PCR result.
Three meta-analyses, each of > 400 cases of PCP,
demonstrated the excellent performance of PCR for both
diagnosis and exclusion of PCP with positive and negative
likelihood ratios of ≥ 10 and ≤ 0.3, respectively and sensitivities,
specificities, PPVs, and NPVs ranging from 97–99, 90–94, 66–85,
and > 99%, respectively (Lu et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2013; Summah
et al., 2013). Hence to exclude Pneumocystis colonization, positive
PCR results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical,
radiological, and laboratory findings. qPCR assays gave better
sensitivities and specificities than non-qPCR assays (Lu et al.,
2011; Fan et al., 2013; Maillet et al., 2014), and are recommended
for the routine diagnosis of PCP due to their potential for
distinguishing colonization from infection, although guidelines
for this are lacking (Alanio et al., 2016). The recently revised
EORTC/MSG definitions include detection of P. jirovecii DNA in
a respiratory tract specimen by qPCR as mycological evidence of
pneumocystosis but do not recommend a threshold for positivity
(Donnelly et al., 2019).
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the preferred specimen for
PCP diagnosis (Alanio et al., 2016). However, since it is not
always possible to obtain BALF, upper respiratory tract specimens
including IS, oropharyngeal washings (OW), nasopharyngeal
aspirates (NA), and nasal swabs (NS) have been evaluated. Strict
comparisons between different respiratory specimens are scarce
but generally the yield from BALF is greater than IS, which in
turn is greater than that from OW (Alanio et al., 2016). Lu
et al. (2011) showed OW had significantly lower sensitivity (76%)
although higher specificity (93%) compared with BALF (100
and 88%, respectively) but the positive likelihood ratio of 10.4
for OW, compared with 8.0 in BALF, indicated that detection
of Pneumocystis DNA in upper respiratory tract specimens
can indicate PCP.
Alanio et al. (2011) attempted to establish qPCR cut-off values
to differentiate true disease from colonization. They reported
no significant difference in fungal DNA load between IS and
BALF samples and that similar cut-off values were applicable to
both. However, there were significantly higher fungal burdens in
BALF and IS from HIV-infected patients compared with those
from non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients. Fauchier
et al. (2016) demonstrated different qPCR cycle thresholds (CT)
to exclude PCP colonization from infection were applicable to
HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients. Applying different
CT values to the two patient groups was associated with 100%
specificity for the diagnosis of PCP in the HIV-positive patients
but only 80% in non-HIV patients, i.e., PCP colonization
was a possibility for 20% of this group, limiting the clinical
value of the assay.
When attempting to use a CT value to differentiate infection
from colonization, the quality of the specimen must also be
considered. Theoretically determining the quantity of human
DNA can act as a surrogate for assessing sample quality, although
for reference it is essential to know the typical burden of human
DNA in respiratory samples and that sampling of respiratory

Kidd et al. Molecular Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Disease
specimens is standardized, which is not the case for BALF (White
et al., 2017a). If technical sources of false negatives have been
eliminated, a negative qPCR can be used to rule out PCP in BALF,
but cannot exclude disease when used on IS, sputa, or other upper
respiratory tract specimens (Alanio et al., 2016).
Several commercial qPCR assays for PCP detection are
available but there are few comparative studies. A performance
evaluation of three kits (AmpliSens P. jirovecii-FRT, MycAssay
Pneumocystis from Myconostica, and Bio-Evolution P. jirovecii
PCR) together with an in-house assay targeting the major surface
glycoprotein gene found excellent concordance between the
in-house assay, Ampli-Sens, and MycAssay (kappa, > 0.8),
with all three assays confirming the diagnosis in 100% of
proven (n = 12) and probable (n = 25) PCP groups, compared
with 100 and 92%, respectively, of cases confirmed by the
Bio-Evolution assay (Sasso et al., 2016). The percentage of
positive results was more variable for the “possible PCP”
category, ranging from 54.5% (Bio-Evolution) to 86.4%
(AmpliSens PCR), but all four assays were effective for PCP
diagnosis. More recently, the performance of the RealStar
P. jirovecii PCR Kit 1.0 EC (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg,
Germany) was compared with the AmpliSens PCR assay (Huh
et al., 2019). The positive and negative percent agreements
were 100 and 96.6%, respectively, and kappa was 0.92. In
contradiction to Alanio et al. (2011), this study demonstrated
low detection rates from sputum and endotracheal aspirates
compared with BALF.
Of interest, the PneumoGeniusR
real-time PCR assay
(PathoNostics) combines P. jirovecii amplification with detection
of point mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS)
gene. A study evaluating the performance of this assay for
distinguishing probable from unlikely PCP reported a sensitivity
and specificity of 70 and 82%, respectively (Montesinos
et al., 2017), further observing good correlation between the
PneumoGeniusR
, an in-house assay qPCR, and the Bio-Evolution
qPCR. The DHPS genotype of 25% (31/120) of PCR-positive
samples could not be determined, likely due to the low
fungal burden observed. Nevertheless, the assay showed a 4.5%
resistance rate from 89 samples. The clinical significance of
mutations in the DHPS gene remains a matter of debate. While
studies have demonstrated an association between the use of
sulfa drugs for PCP prophylaxis and DHPS mutations, whether
these mutations confer resistance to sulfamethoxazole, for PCP
treatment is unclear as published studies provide conflicting
results (summarized in Huang et al., 2004; Alvarez-Martínez
et al., 2010). Clinical resistance to sulfonamides in P. jirovecii
is very uncommon.
The Pneumocystis working group of the FPCRI was established
to evaluate the performance of the different PCP PCR assays used
in reference laboratories in order to establish a consensus method
for qPCR and assist laboratory standardization of quantification.
An intra-laboratory analysis compared five in-house and five
commercial qPCR assays. Assays targeting whole nucleic acid
(RNA plus DNA) using reverse transcriptase (RT)-qPCR were
superior to qPCRs (p ≤ 0.001) testing DNA only, and assays
targeting the multi-copy mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU)
were more sensitive than the mitochondrial large subunit
(mtLSU), the major surface glycoprotein, and the single copy
beta-tubulin gene (Gits-Muselli et al., 2019).
Syndromic Testing
The use of syndromic testing PCR panels for diagnosis of
various infections is increasingly popular. For IFDs, there are a
number of FDA – or comparable regulatory agency – approved
panels. As part of the target menu for CNS infections, the
BioFire FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel (bioMérieux,
Marcy l’Etoile, France) detects one fungal target, Cryptococcus
neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii, in addition to bacterial and viral
targets in CSF in approximately 1 h. While rapid, this test does
not differentiate between C. neoformans and C. gattii, and recent
studies have noted poor detection of cryptococcal infection when
compared with cryptococcal antigen tests (Liesman et al., 2018;
Lee et al., 2019). Test costs are also high (about AUD 250/test).
A multiplex tandem-PCR (MT-PCR) based panel, also for use
on CSF (AusDiagnostics, Mascot, Australia) includes a target that
detects the four main serotypes of C. neoformansspecies complex.
Data on the performance of this test in the clinical setting are few.
For patients with suspected fungal pneumonia, the
AusDiagnostics Pneumonia and Atypical Pneumonia MT￾PCR panels (AusDiagnostics) include a range of bacterial and
viral targets, as well as one for A. fumigatus (RUO), P. jirovecii,
and C. neoformans/gattii (Table 3). These panels utilize a range
of respiratory specimens including sputum, bronchial washings,
and BALF. There are no published evaluations of this test.
Lastly, a number of “sepsis” syndromic panels have been
developed. Again, one from AusDiagnostics which works with
nucleic acid extracts from positive blood cultures includes five
Candida species among its 24 targets (Table 2). The ePlex
assays (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA, United States)
are fully automated tests based on electrowetting using
eSansor technology for the detection of analyte targets directly
from positive blood cultures after multiplex nucleic acid
extraction, amplification, and digestions. Cartridges for the
identification of Gram negative bacteria (BCID-GN), Gram
positive bacteria (BCID-GP), and fungal pathogens (BCID-FP)
directly from positive blood culture bottles may be applied
as required, depending on Gram stain results; the BCID-FP
panel targets 16 fungal species/genera, including C. albicans,
C. auris, C. dubliniensis, Candida famata, C. glabrata, Candida
guilliermondii, Candida kefyr, C. krusei, Candida lusitaniae,
C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, Cryptococcus gattii, Cryptococcus
neoformans, Fusarium spp., and Rhodotorula spp. (Maubon et al.,
2018). A small validation study found the BCID-FP panel had
100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for six Candida species
grown from blood cultures, which the panel was designed
to detect. However, one case of Candida inconspicua (not
targeted by the BCID-FP panel) was missed. The combination
of blood culture and ePlex reduced the turn-around time
from 72–96 to 10 h (Huang et al., 2019). The Accelerate
Pheno system (Accelerate Diagnostics) is a fully automated
system utilizing gel electrofiltration and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) for the identification of two Candida species
as well as bacteria, directly from positive blood cultures. This
system had sensitivities of 100% for both Candida sp., and

GENOME-BASED FUNGAL
IDENTIFICATION AND
CHARACTERIZATION
DNA Metabarcoding for Precision
Diagnosis of IFDs Directly From Clinical
Specimens
The fundamental principle of DNA barcoding is that the
intraspecies variation is less than the interspecies variation,
effectively establishing a “barcoding gap.” An effort to standardize
sequence-based identification of fungi led to the ribosomal
ITS1/2 region being proposed as the primary fungal DNA
barcode (Schoch et al., 2012). However, its universal use is
compromised by the lack of quality controlled reference sequence
databases. To overcome this problem, the ISHAM working group
for Barcoding of Medical Fungi was established in 2010, which
culminated in the establishment of the ISHAM ITS barcode
database for human and animal pathogenic fungi4
in 2015
(Irinyi et al., 2015). Studying the intra- and interspecies variation
of the ITS1/2 region in human pathogenic fungi confirmed
earlier findings that this genetic locus was only able to identify
approximately 75% of all fungal species accurately to the species
4http://its.mycologylab.org/
level (Irinyi et al., 2016), prompting the search for a secondary
fungal DNA barcode.
In a global study testing the genetic variability and ability
to design universal primers for a variety of genetic loci, the
translocation elongation factor 1 alpha (TEF1α) gene was
proposed as the secondary fungal DNA barcode (Stielow et al.,
2015). Again the lack of a quality-controlled reference database
has hindered its widespread application in routine fungal
diagnostics. Therefore, a complementary reference database for
TEF1α was established in 2017 (seventh iBOL Conference,
South Africa). The ISHAM Barcoding database, accessible at
either www.its.mycologylab.org or www.isham.org (Meyer et al.,
2019), includes quality controlled reference sequences for both
ITS1/2 (n = 4200) and TEF1α (n = 2432) targets, representing 645
and 346 species, respectively, of human and animal pathogenic
fungi. The Dual DNA barcoding system for fungi enables the
identification of the majority of human and animal pathogenic
fungi (Hoang et al., 2019).
The development of NGS has enabled the simultaneous
sequencing of mixed microbial communities directly from a
variety of clinical samples (e.g., blood, sputum, BALF, tissue, and
stools) using either Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technology
(Lefterova et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016; Hong et al., 2018;
Langelier et al., 2018; Blauwkamp et al., 2019; Charalampous
et al., 2019; McTaggart et al., 2019). Sequences obtained from
clinical samples through NGS can then be identified to the
genus and species level by using sequence alignment tools
such as BLAST or WIMP (Camacho et al., 2009; Juul et al.,
2015) against appropriate publicly available quality-controlled
reference sequence databases, e.g., ISHAM barcoding database
UNITE, RefSeq, and BOLD (Hebert et al., 2003; Kõljalg et al.,
2013; Schoch et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2019). However, there
are currently a number of major limitations in this technology
which may lead to inaccurate or insufficient identification
of the fungal pathogen, including: (i) pre-PCR biases, such
as sample handling, contamination introduced during sample
collection, aliquoting, nucleic acid extraction, library preparation,

or pooling (Salter et al., 2014; Strong et al., 2014), DNA extraction
methods including the choice of storage buffer and extraction
kit (Hallmaier-Wacker et al., 2018), the quantity of host DNA,
which could be reduced by using various depletion methods
(Hasan et al., 2016), and the issues related to the extraction of
DNA of adequate quality (high purity, high molecular weight,
and high concentration) (Hasan et al., 2016; Hallmaier-Wacker
et al., 2018; Sanderson et al., 2018; Nicholls et al., 2019); (ii)
PCR biases, including primer mismatches and variable length
of the obtained amplicon (Schloss and Westcott, 2011; Boers
et al., 2019); (iii) high sequencing error rate of the current NGS
technologies, especially long read sequencing (Bakker et al., 2012;
Schirmer et al., 2015; Tyler et al., 2018); (iv) the lack of complete
and quality-controlled reference sequence databases with correct
taxonomic assignment (Irinyi et al., 2016; Greninger, 2018); and
(v) lack of appropriate bioinformatic tools, including alignment
algorithms and cross-talk between fungal sequences (Mulcahy￾O’Grady and Workentine, 2016; Chiu and Miller, 2019). As such,
any DNA metabarcoding-based pathogen identification should
be interpreted and reviewed in the clinical context of the disease
symptoms. With technological advancement and increasing
moves to metagenomics approaches for clinical diagnostics, it
is anticipated that these issues will be overcome. NGS-based
DNA metabarcoding in combination with high quality reference
sequence databases promises to drastically reduce the turnaround
time for the diagnosis of IFDs to 24–48 h. But the main
drawback of clinical metagenomics is currently the cost, running
to approximately one million dollars at minimum after one
considering the sequencing facility, computational infrastructure,
and personnel required to run it (Greninger, 2018).
The introduction of culture and PCR free metagenomics for
the direct detection of human pathogens in clinical specimens
has to date only been applied to bacteria (Chiu and Miller, 2019)
and has still to overcome major challenges associated with the low
pathogen presence in a clinical sample, and the improvement of
the DNA quality, sequencing library preparation methodology,
computational bioinformatics pipelines, and the reduction of
the associated sequencing costs. Our group was recently the
first to report the use of MinION-based NGS sequencing to
confirm the diagnosis of an IFI to detect P. jirovecii directly
from BAL and sputum (Irinyi et al., 2019). Another group has
developed an NGS-based method to detect a broad range of fungi
in BAL specimens and applied it to the analysis of the fungal
microbiome of the lung during fungal infection, demonstrating
the potential to distinguish fungal infection from colonization
(McTaggart et al., 2019).
Whole Genome Sequencing for
Epidemiological Studies, Outbreak
Investigations, and Resistance Gene
Detection
Next generation sequencing technologies enable the application
of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to fungal genotyping
without genetic insights or prior knowledge of the population
structure of a species in question. As such, it can be used to
investigate the genetic relatedness of isolates in an outbreak
setting or for the detection of a specific mutation related to
antifungal resistance. WGS is becoming the method of choice
for molecular epidemiology studies, replacing traditional typing
methods, including multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). WGS
genotyping is based on the detection of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) through a genome-wide view which
can be compared either in the presence of an already existing
reference genome or after de novo genome assembly to enable
genome-wide investigation.
Whole genome sequencing typing was applied to investigate
a large healthcare related outbreak caused by Exserohilum
rostratum meningitis in the United States following the use
of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injections contaminated
with this fungus. Isolates cultured from the MPA vials as well
as clinical isolates were shown to be highly clonal, strongly
indicating a single source. Two SNPs were identified among the
outbreak-related isolates compared to hundreds of thousands of
SNPs identified between the non-outbreak isolates (Litvintseva
et al., 2014). Similarly, WGS SNP analysis was applied to
the bloodstream infections caused by Sarocladium kiliense
after administration of contaminated anti-nausea medication in
oncology patients, with five SNPs being identified among the
outbreak-related strains (Etienne et al., 2016). More recently,
WGS typing was used to characterize four major clades of
C. auris strains. Isolates within each clade were clonal, while there
were thousands of SNPs between the clades. Additionally, WGS
identified a specific mutation in the ERG11 gene associated with
azole resistance (Lockhart et al., 2017). Further examples of WGS
applications in detection of resistance are discussed in Section
“Molecular Detection of Antifungal Drug Resistance.”
Although the costs of NGS sequencing equipment, assembly,
and analysis continue to fall, the lack of comprehensive reference
genome sequence databases is a major challenge for the
incorporation of WGS sequencing into routine infection control
and outbreak investigations.
MOLECULAR DETECTION OF
ANTIFUNGAL DRUG RESISTANCE
Antifungal susceptibility testing of fungal pathogens is a core
function of the diagnostic mycology laboratory. Phenotypic
methods have been standardized, and have established practice
utility with interpretative minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) clinical breakpoints (CBPs) in some Candida and
Aspergillus species (Cuenca-Estrella, 2014). However, culture￾based methods are slow, and may be hampered by poor growth
rates (or for some molds, failure to sporulate), and a lack of
interpretive criteria.
Molecular tools have good potential to offer more rapid
results, and have the advantage of being able to determine the
underlying genetic basis of resistance (Perlin and Wiederhold,
2017). However, many molecular methods are not standardized.
Further, it is important that a particular genetic target can
be linked to a validated mechanism of resistance for a
particular drug. Ideally, the target should confer: (i) concordant
results by MIC testing; (ii) an altered effector or downstream

action following alteration of the drug target; and (iii) either
documented resistance in animal models or clinical failure with
treatment. Here we review and put into perspective, the role
of molecular methods for assessing antifungal drug resistance.
Although best illustrated with the echinocandins with Candida
species and azoles with A. fumigatus, the Candida-azole “bug–
drug” pair is also discussed.
Molecular Methods to Detect Azole
Resistance in Candida Species
Azole resistance in Candida species can arise through: (i) point
mutations in various Candida genes; (ii) upregulation of drug
efflux pumps or transporters; (iii) overexpression of the drug
target; and (iv) cellular stress response factors (reviewed in
Cuenca-Estrella, 2014; Cowen et al., 2015). The contribution
of each of these mechanisms appears to vary by species but
generally, upregulation and overexpression mechanisms play
the greater role.
Point mutations in the ERG11 gene, which encodes 14-alpha￾demethylase, the target of the azoles, alters drug affinity and
in C. albicans at least, also results in ERG11 overexpression
via mutations in the transcription factor UPC2 (Flowers et al.,
2012). Mutations have been best described in three “regional
hotspots” of ERG11 (amino acid positions 105–165, 266–287, and
405–488) and in the ERG3 gene (T330A and A351V) (Martel
et al., 2010), with again mutation studies best documented in
C. albicans. These mutations can be reliably detected by allele￾specific real-time molecular probes, DNA microarray technology,
high-resolution melt curve analysis, and DNA sequence analysis
(Perlin, 2009). These techniques are robust and can be used
on primary specimens, but staff expertise is essential. Methods
to detect multiple point mutations are best multiplexed, and if
DNA sequencing is undertaken, the need for multiple sequencing
runs is costly. Further, whether a detected mutation in the ERG
gene family confers phenotypic resistance requires additional
experiments to establish a causal effect as not all amino acid
substitutions are linked to resistance (Jensen, 2016).
Instead, upregulation of the azole efflux pumps encoded
by genes of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) or the major
facilitator superfamilies (MFS) is the more important mechanism
of resistance through changes in the regulation of their expression
by mutations in the transcription factors, e.g., TAC1 and MRR1
(C. albicans) and CgPDR1 (C. glabrata) (Vermitsky et al., 2006;
Morschhäuser et al., 2007). Candida species also have plasticity
in their genomes with movement within chromosomes, which
can alter both efflux pump and ERG11 expression (Perlin and
Wiederhold, 2017). Finally, biofilm formation that limits drug
access and impacts on resistance to the azoles and other drug
classes is well described in Candida species, including the
emerging C. auris (Sherry et al., 2017).
Because of the diversity of resistance mechanisms, pragmatic
positioning of molecular methods to detect clinically relevant
drug resistance is difficult. The exception may be in C. glabrata
where azole resistance is associated with mutations in the
transcription factor pdr1 (Ferrari et al., 2009), or if targeted
DNA sequencing is performed for a mutation already known to
confer resistance. Resistance mutations are broadly distributed
throughout the genome and as such, NGS approaches have been
studied for the detection of mutations in genes associated with
azole resistance including in ERG11, ERG3, TAC1, and CgPDR1
(Garnaud et al., 2015; Biswas et al., 2017; Castanheira et al.,
2017). NGS further has potential to detect novel mutations
implicated in phenotypic resistance that may otherwise be
missed by targeted DNA sequencing. In C. glabrata, NGS has
detected multiple SNPs in CgPDR1 and CgCDR1 in azole￾resistant isolates; although none were definitively associated
with resistance, azole-resistant isolates tended to have amino
substitutions in pdr1 beyond the first 250 amino acid positions,
unlike the susceptible isolates (Biswas et al., 2018). The cost
of NGS is currently ∼AUD 80/sample (∼USD 57) but this is
likely to fall with technological advances allowing ease of use for
routine applications.
Molecular Methods to Detect Azole
Resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus
Overall, the utility of molecular methods for detecting azole
resistance in A. fumigatus is more straightforward than in
Candida species as there is a strong association between specific
mutations in the CYP51A geneF (the homolog of ERG11 of
Candida species) and the azole-resistant phenotype, rendering
this locus a well-suited target for a molecular-based assay. Amino
acid substitutions in cyp51A are well described (Chowdhary et al.,
2014) and in azole-resistant environmental isolates, mutations in
the tandem base pair repeats of the promoter region of CYP51A
coupled to amino acid substitutions in cyp51A leading to the
following changes – TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A (van
der Linden et al., 2013). Other mechanisms of azole resistance
include the overexpression of the CYP51A, and ABC and MFS
genes as well as the gain of function mutation in the CCATT￾binding transcription factor complex subunit hapE (Perlin and
Wiederhold, 2017). However, the clinical relevance of these
mechanisms is still uncertain.
To detect resistance-associated mutations, approaches such
as real-time PCR, with or without molecular beacon probes,
high-resolution melt curve analysis, DNA sequencing, and most
recently NGS have all been used (Meletiadis et al., 2012; Hagiwara
et al., 2014). The first real-time multiplex PCR assay was of
an allele-specific molecular beacon design which differentiated
wild type CYP51A from 7 mutant alleles at codon position 54
(Balashov et al., 2005). Other molecular beacon-based assays
since including those employing TaqMan technology have shown
similar good results, when validated against the gold standard
of DNA sequencing. As such, the most commonly used is a
conventional PCR amplifying the CYP51A gene and promoter
regions with Sanger sequencing (Dudakova et al., 2017). Ahmad
et al. (2014) developed a PCR-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay for detection of TR34 as well as
the L98H substitution. However, NGS may be used to determine
the genome-wide basis of resistance. Hagiwara et al. (2014)
used NGS to identify non-synonymous mutations in sequential
A. fumigatus isolates, which would have been missed by PCR￾RFLP or microsatellite genotyping.

Kidd et al. Molecular Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Disease
The above methods all require the availability of a cultured
isolate for assessing resistance. Not uncommonly, IA is
diagnosed by culture-independent methods; hence, azole
resistance is probably under-reported. Several molecular assays
that simultaneously detect Aspergillus spp. and azole resistance
from clinical samples have been developed. They combine high
sensitivity with high specificity to detect the small quantities
of Aspergillus DNA in biological samples. Most formats are
PCR-based followed by sequence analysis to identify mutations
(Dudakova et al., 2017). Using a nested PCR, in culture-negative
PCR-positive samples, the TR34/L98H and M220 mutations
were detected in 55.1% of samples from patients with chronic
pulmonary aspergillosis or ABPA (Denning et al., 2011).
The AsperGeniusR
and MycoGENIE commercial assays
simultaneously detect Aspergillus spp. and common CYP51A
mutations directly in clinical specimens (Table 1). AsperGeniusR
has performed well on BALF (including culture-negative fluid)
and blood samples from hematology and ICU patients (Chong
et al., 2015; White et al., 2017b). While the sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, and NPV were 88.9, 89.3, 72.7, and 96.2%, respectively, for
the hematology group, and 80.9, 93.3, 80, and 93.3%, respectively,
for the ICU group, CYP51A mutations were detected in 2/14
positive Aspergillus PCRs from the combined patient groups (one
TR34/L98H and one TR46/Y121F/T289A); the detected resistance
mutations were associated with clinical failure of voriconazole
therapy (Chong et al., 2015). The sensitivity and specificity
of the MycoGENIE were 92.9 and 90.1%, respectively, using
respiratory samples (n = 88) and 100 and 84.6%, respectively,
with serum samples; this study detected no CYP51A mutants
directly from specimen (Dannaoui et al., 2017). Another study
compared the AsperGeniusR
and MycoGENIE assays for the
detection of Aspergillus and resistance mutations in sputum
specimens from cystic fibrosis patients (Guegan et al., 2018).
Neither test detected any CYP51A resistance mutations, and
the AsperGeniusR had only limited success in amplifying the
CYP51A gene targets, likely due to low fungal burden (Guegan
et al., 2018). While time efficient, these commercial assays are
limited by the fact that CYP51A is a single copy gene, and
that they detect only azole resistance involving the tandem
repeat. In Australia where the incidence of azole resistance is
low (< 3%), 2/3 azole resistant isolates had the G54R mutation
associated with high MICs to itraconazole and posaconazole
(Talbot et al., 2018). A recent study from the United Kingdom
employing the AsperGenius assayR
(PathoNostics BV) showed
that 16/22 (73%) isolates with the resistant phenotype harbored
no mutations detected by this test (Abdolrasouli et al., 2018). The
FungiplexR Aspergillus Azole-R IVD real-time PCR platform
is also now available. It has two targets TR34 and TR46;
clinical studies examining its utility for resistance detection are
scarce. It should be noted, however, that since the CYP51A
gene is single copy, and the target used for detection of
Aspergillus is multi-copy, to date, the assays have greater utility
in detecting Aspergillus per se, rather than detecting its resistance
mutations. Expert opinion is that there is value in routinely
evaluating only those samples with high fungal loads for azole
resistance, and only in regions with a high prevalence of pan￾azole resistance (Alanio and Bretagne, 2017). Further studies
are required to determine whether the information provided
by commercial assays leads to more rapid diagnosis of IA
(Buchheidt et al., 2017).
Molecular Methods to Detect
Echinocandin Resistance in Candida
spp.
Standard MIC measurement is at times, unable to reliably
distinguish wildtype from non-wildtype isolates, particularly
for caspofungin. The application of molecular methods offers
good potential to rapidly detect echinocandin resistance which
hinges upon detection of specific mutations in the FKS genes of
Candida. FKS genotype analysis is a better predictor of resistance
than MIC testing alone because the presence of FKS mutations
correlates with high drug MICs and is an independent risk
factor for therapeutic failure (summarized in Shields et al., 2012;
Arendrup and Perlin, 2014).
Unlike the azoles, echinocandins are not impacted by the
actions of multidrug efflux transporters and the resistant
phenotype is well understood to be a result of a number of
amino acid substitutions in “hot spot” regions of the Fks subunits
(Arendrup and Perlin, 2014). In Candida species, there are three
FKS genes – FKS1, FKS2, and FKS3. Mutations in FKS1 alone
will confer resistance in all species. In C. glabrata, mutations
in FKS2 will also confer resistant phenotypes (Arendrup and
Perlin, 2014; Pham et al., 2014). Of the total number of ∼20
known mutations linked to resistance, only a few mutations
account for 65–80% of observed echinocandin resistance (Perlin,
2015). In C. albicans for example, amino acid substitutions at
positions Fks1p-S641 and Fks1p-S645 are the cause of nearly 90%
of resistance seen. Molecular methods to date have only been
evaluated using cultures and not directly on clinical specimens.
As such DNA sequencing lends itself as the logical method
to resolve all known FKS mutations within 3–4 h. This requires
knowledge of specific mutations that have been validated as
resistance targets. Targeted gene sequencing of multiple genes
is impractical and costly for clinical laboratories. Alternatives
include: (i) real-time PCR assays with or without probe detection
which can distinguish WT strains from those with FKS mutations
(Balashov et al., 2006); (ii) microsphere-based assays using
Luminex MagPix technology (Pham et al., 2014); and (iii)
more sophisticated molecular beacon and melt curve assays
(Zhao et al., 2016). A dual assay for C. glabrata FKS1 and
FKS2 identified the predominant clinically relevant resistance￾associated mutations in FKS1 (e.g., leading to amino acid
substitutions S629P, F625S) and FKS2 (F659S, S663P) within 3 h
(Zhao et al., 2016). A simple, rapid assay using classical PCR
primer sets was developed to detect the 10 most common FKS
mutations in C. glabrata within 4 h (Dudiuk et al., 2014).
Finally, NGS is suited to detecting a large number of mutations
in multiple FKS genes in clinical isolates of C. glabrata with high
MICs to the echinocandins (Garnaud et al., 2015; Biswas et al.,
2017). Biswas et al. (2017) used NGS to retrospectively study three
strain pairs of C. glabrata from three patients where antifungal
resistance developed during treatment. Two of three isolate pairs
developed a > 60-fold increase in the MICs to all echinocandins

and NGS detected mutations in either the FKS1 (S629P) or FKS2
(S663P) genes of the resistant isolates (Biswas et al., 2017).
ISSUES RELATING TO IMPLEMENTING
NEW TECHNOLOGIES
Pathology (or diagnostic) stewardship is an area deserving
consideration when implementing new technologies, and
appropriate use of diagnostic tests for IFD should directly
complement antifungal stewardship. As technical capabilities
are being revolutionized by new technologies, there is a
risk of exceeding laboratory capabilities to apply new tests
effectively and efficiently; overuse of rapid diagnostic tests
will increase healthcare costs without significantly improving
healthcare outcomes. Therefore, consideration should be given
to positioning particular tests to support specific patient groups
or specimen types, taking in to consideration testing intervals,
the significance of positive and negative results, and how results
can be communicated with clinicians in a timely manner
(Messacar et al., 2017).
From the laboratory perspective, when new tests are
implemented the validation, obtaining sufficient “positive
control” material, and other technical issues such as fungal
contamination of commercial reagents (Harrison et al., 2010)
need to be considered. Consideration must be given to how the
results of molecular tests will be interpreted, e.g., as infection,
colonization, or contamination. We are not yet in a position for
molecular technologies to replace microscopy and culture for
diagnosis of IFD, or broth microdilution antifungal susceptibility
testing, although microbiologists should be prepared to transition
to these methods when the time arrives.
Cost-effectiveness is another critical factor to be considered
before implementing any new diagnostic method. Additionally,
while outsourcing low throughput “boutique” pathology tests is
common practice to reduce costs, this increases the turnaround
time, raising the possibility that the test results may not be
available in a suitable timeframe to impact patient management.
Therefore, consideration must be given to implementing fungal
diagnostic tests that are easily accessible. Using the example of
NGS, sequencing costs are decreasing, and therefore likely to
become a viable option for many pathology laboratories in the
near future. Cost considerations will be the initial laboratory
setup, cost of the instrumentation, and training laboratory staff.
In the longer term, costs would include reagents and accessories,
and equipment servicing. If the NGS service is not in-house, costs
may be higher and turnaround times longer. Implementing IVD
molecular tests may not be as costly if the laboratory already
has access to a real-time PCR platform; in this case, the bulk
of ongoing costs are likely to be related to kit procurement;
and while costs may exceed those of culture and microscopy,
considering the overall cost of healthcare rather than the
immediate cost to pathology laboratories may see a cost benefit.
An Australian study examined the cost–benefit of a biomarker￾based diagnostic strategy using data from a randomized control
trial of IA in HSCT patients and individual patient costings
(hospital length of stay, treatments costs, pathology test costs);
costs were determined for 137 proven or probable IA patients
at four Australian centers. While the biomarker-based diagnostic
strategy was not inexpensive, it was found to be cost-effective if
a survival benefit is maintained over several years (Macesic et al.,
2017); the cost benefit in this case would have to be considered
over the scope of the overall health budget, rather than just that
of the pathology provider. The cost-effectiveness of a Candida
PCR test was examined in terms of the use of fluconazole versus
the more expensive echinocandin drugs as empiric treatment
of Candida peritonitis, when traditionally fluconazole resistant
species (e.g., C. glabrata, C. krusei) could be quickly detected
by the PCR. This study found that use of fluconazole empirical
treatment with PCR to detect the fluconazole resistant species
(changing over to an echinocandin) is more cost effective than
using fluconazole empirical treatment without PCR (Pagès et al.,
2017). Furthermore, a recent analysis of the cost-effectiveness
of T2Candida determined it was less costly than blood culture￾directed and empiric echinocandin therapy. Patch et al. (2018)
found the mean duration of empiric treatment in patients with
T2Candida-negative/BC-negative results was 2.4 days, compared
with 6.7 days prior to the introduction of T2Candida testing. The
estimated financial savings associated with reduced use of empiric
therapy was US$280 per patient.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Advances in molecular diagnostic technologies have undoubtedly
improved the landscape for fungal diagnostics and identification,
enabling a range of tests for diagnosis and/or screening at
risk patients for IFDs, with rapid turnaround times, and
covering a broad range of IFDs. Increasing experience with
PCR assays to directly detect fungi in clinical specimens with
clinical validation studies has positioned these assay types
well on the way to becoming routine in clinical laboratories.
Similarly, standardization of Aspergillus PCR enables robust
inter-laboratory comparisons and has been included as a
biomarker for IA in clinical trials. Molecular assays that directly
detect Candida spp. from blood cultures or WB have good
potential to be used in conjunction with other fungal biomarkers
to inform the likelihood of infection. It is envisaged that as other
genera/species-specific assays advance toward standardization,
they will also have a greater role to play in routine diagnostics,
as will molecular assays that enable simultaneous detection of
pathogens and their major resistance markers. Finally, with
high-level DNA barcoding, NGS technologies, and metagenomic
approaches, the vision of a “one stop shop” for fungal biomarkers
seems to be within reach in the foreseeable future. This
wealth of data will require parallel studies to examine their
clinical applications.
