Abstract
Background: Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes reportedly play important roles in the pathogenesis of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic agent; however, its effects on fibrocytes have not been investigated.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether pirfenidone inhibits fibrocyte pool size in the lungs of bleomycin￾treated mice.
Methods: Bleomycin (100 mg/kg) was infused with osmotic pumps into C57BL/6 mice, and pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day)
was orally administered daily for 2 wk. The lungs were removed, and single-cell suspensions were subjected to fluorescence￾activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to detect fibrocytes, which were defined as CD45 and collagen-I double-positive cells.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on the lung specimens to quantify fibrocytes. Chemokines in the lung digests were
measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of pirfenidone on alveolar macrophages was evaluated with
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In a therapeutic setting, pirfenidone administration was initiated 10 days after bleomycin
treatment. For chemotaxis assay, lung fibrocytes were isolated with immunomagnetic selection (CD45-positive mesenchymal
cells) after culture and allowed to migrate toward chemokines in the presence or absence of pirfenidone. Moreover, the
effect of pirfenidone on the expression of chemokine receptors on fibrocytes was evaluated.
Results: Pirfenidone significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis as assessed with quantitative histology
and collagen measurement. Fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mice lungs was attenuated from 26.5% to 13.7% by
pirfenidone on FACS analysis. This outcome was also observed in a therapeutic setting. Immunohistochemistry revealed that
fibrocytes were significantly decreased by pirfenidone administration compared with those in bleomycin-treated mice
(P = 0.0097). Increased chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) and CCL12 production in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs was
significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (P = 0.0003 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Pirfenidone also attenuated macrophage
counts stimulated by bleomycin in BAL fluid. Fibrocyte migration toward CCL2 and chemokine (CC motif) receptor-2
expression on fibrocytes was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro.
Conclusions: Pirfenidone attenuated the fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs via attenuation of CCL2 and
CCL12 production in vivo, and fibrocyte migration was inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. Fibrocyte inhibition is considered a
mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of pirfenidone.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease
characterised by progressive scarring of the lung paren￾chyma [1]. Although the pathologic processes that cause
disease progression are not fully understood, IPF is char￾acterised by a microscopic pattern of usual interstitial
pneumonia, which includes excessive collagen deposition,
honeycombing, and the presence of fibroblastic foci [2].
Fibroblastic foci are areas of myofibroblast proliferation
thought to be the main site of abnormal extracellular
matrix (ECM) deposition. ECM-producing lung fibroblasts
are the key source of this deposition; however, these cells
are heterogeneous in a number of phenotypic features. Re￾cent investigations have provided support for the hypoth￾esis that they arise from several sources, including (i)
resident pulmonary fibroblasts, (ii) bone marrow-derived
circulating fibrocytes that infiltrate the lungs, and (iii) al￾veolar epithelial cells through a process called epithelial￾mesenchymal transition (EMT) [3].
Among these possible sources of lung fibroblasts, bone
marrow-derived circulating fibrocytes are mesenchymal
progenitor cells that express markers compatible with
leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and fibro￾blasts [4]. Fibrocytes also express a number of other cell
markers, including chemokine receptors and adhesion
molecules [5]. They are chemotactically recruited to sites
of tissue injury [6] and contribute to the propagation of
the fibrotic response [7]. Recent reports have revealed
that the number of circulating fibrocytes is significantly
elevated in patients with IPF, and higher numbers are
correlated with early mortality [8]. Taken together, this
evidence suggests that controlling and managing fibro￾cytes could be a novel therapeutic approach for IPF.
Although no well-accepted medical therapy for patients
with IPF has yet been established [1], vigorous efforts to
develop effective agents are being made. Among the thera￾peutic drugs available, pirfenidone, which has anti-fibrotic
properties and was approved for the treatment of IPF in
Japan in 2008, reportedly limits the decline in pulmonary
function, especially that of vital capacity, that accompanies
IPF [9,10]. Pirfenidone inhibits both profibrotic and proin￾flammatory cytokines [11]; however, its effect on fibrocytes
has not been investigated.
In this study, we hypothesised that pirfenidone elicits
its pharmacological effects by inhibiting fibrocytes. To
test this hypothesis, we administered pirfenidone to
bleomycin (BLM)-treated mice and examined the effect
of pirfenidone on fibrocytes using fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (FACS) analysis. We also investigated the ef￾fect of pirfenidone on chemokine production in BLM￾treated mice lungs. Moreover, we examined the effect of
pirfenidone on cultured fibrocyte migration and chemo￾kine receptor expression in vitro. This study is the first
to demonstrate the effect of pirfenidone on fibrocytes,
which are now considered essential to the pathogenesis
of IPF. Findings from our preliminary studies were re￾ported in abstract form at a meeting of the American
Thoracic Society [12].
Materials and methods
Detailed materials and methods are described in
Additional file 1.
Animals
Nine-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River La￾boratories Japan, Yokohama, Japan) were used in all ex￾periments. They were randomised into various groups
before the initiation of the experimental protocols,
which were approved by the animal care and use com￾mittee of Nippon Medical School (Tokyo, Japan).
BLM treatment and pirfenidone administration
Osmotic pumps (ALZET model 2001; DURECT Corpor￾ation, Cupertino, California, USA) containing 200 μL saline
with or without BLM (100 mg/kg; Nippon Kayaku Co.,
Tokyo, Japan) were implanted subcutaneously [13]. BLM
was infused constantly via the pumps over 7 days according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pirfenidone (Shionogi &
Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was suspended in 0.5% carboxy￾methylcellulose solution (vehicle) and administered orally
for 14 days after osmotic pump implantation. The volume
of administration was determined according to body
weight. Animals were allocated into 4 groups (n = 6/group):
normal control, BLM, pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day), and
BLM + pirfenidone. The pirfenidone dose was selected ac￾cording to a report published elsewhere [11]. Pirfenidone
was also administered in a therapeutic setting beginning at
day 10 to assess the effect of the drug on the fibrotic phase
of BLM model mice.
Histological examination
Lung samples were fixed in 10% formalin buffer (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for histological
examination. Paraffin Sections 2- to 4-μm thick were cut
from fixed lungs, stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) and Masson trichrome, and examined with a
microscope.
Evaluation of lung fibrosis with collagen measurement
Lungs harvested on day 28 were used for collagen assay.
Total lung collagen was determined using a Sircol Colla￾gen Assay kit (Biocolor Ltd., Carrickfergus, Northern
Ireland, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
FACS analysis of whole-lung cells
On day 14 of BLM treatment, the lungs of the mice were
removed and minced to obtain single-cell suspensions
for FACS analysis. This time point was chosen according
Inomata et al. Respiratory Research 2014, 15:16 Page 2 of 14
http://respiratory-research.com/content/15/1/16

to previous studies that investigated fibrocyte accumula￾tion approximately 14 days after BLM treatment [14-16].
The number of total nucleated cells in the lungs of the
mice was counted, and the cells were stained with fluor￾escein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-mouse CD45 anti￾body, then permeabilised with a BD Cytofix/Cytoperm
Kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, California, USA) and
stained with biotin-conjugated anti-collagen I (Col-I)
antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania, USA)
followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. FACS
analysis was performed using a BD FACSCanto II (BD Bio￾sciences). In the therapeutic setting, the lungs of the mice
were removed on day 21 and subjected to FACS analysis.
Immunohistochemistry for CD45 and Col-I
Lung tissue sections were incubated with anti-mouse
CD45 monoclonal antibody followed by Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin G (IgG; Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). Subsequently,
these sections were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse
polyclonal Col-I IgG and biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG as the secondary antibody followed by Alexa Fluor
594-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies). Sections
were then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, California, USA).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Chemokine (CC motif ) ligand-2 (CCL2), CCL12, and
chemokine (CXC motif ) ligand-12 (CXCL12) levels were
measured in lung homogenates using specific ELISA kits
from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA).
Immunohistochemistry for CCL2
Tissue sections were incubated with anti-mouse CCL2
monoclonal antibody overnight at 4°C. They were then
incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-rat IgG2b as the
secondary antibody and stained with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin followed by staining
with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine.
Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from mice
lungs treated with BLM in the presence or absence of
pirfenidone
Tracheas were cannulated and BAL was performed with
1 mL of 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid/phos￾phate-buffered saline. After the cell number in the BAL
fluid was counted, the cells were cytospun onto glass
slides and stained with Diff-Quick (Kokusai Shiyaku,
Kobe, Japan) for differential cell counting.
Fibrocyte isolation and chemotaxis assay
Murine fibrocytes were isolated from the lungs accord￾ing to previously published methods [17]. FACS analysis
was performed according to the methods described
above to evaluate the proportion of fibrocytes from the
isolated cells. Chemotaxis assays were performed using a
Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg,
Maryland, USA) as described previously [17]. Isolated
murine lung fibrocytes were suspended at 1 × 106 cells/
mL in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium containing
0.1% bovine serum albumin and allowed to migrate to￾ward various concentrations of CCL2 and CCL12 with
or without pirfenidone (100 μg/mL) at 37°C in a moist
5% CO2/95% air atmosphere incubator. After the cells
were cultured overnight, migration was assessed by
counting the number of cells in 10 high-power fields per
well with a light microscope.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)
Isolated fibrocytes were cultured in the presence or ab￾sence of pirfenidone (100 μg/mL) for 48 h. Then, total
RNA was extracted using an ISOGEN with Spin Column
(Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and converted to comple￾mentary DNA as described elsewhere [18]. Real-time
quantitative PCR was performed using the TaqMan
method with an Applied Biosystems 7500/7500 Fast Real￾Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Japan, Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) to evaluate chemokine receptor expression.
Statistical analysis
The animal experiment involved at least 6 mice in each
treatment group unless otherwise stated. Comparisons
among multiple groups were analysed using one-way
analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc correc￾tion. An unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test was used
for single comparisons. Data were analysed using JMP 9
software version 9.0.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North
Carolina, USA). Differences were considered statistically
significant if P values were less than 0.05.
Results
Histological examination of the anti-fibrotic effects of
pirfenidone on BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice
As an initial assessment, histological analysis of HE- and
Masson trichrome-stained lung sections was performed
to examine whether the fibrotic response in mice receiv￾ing BLM was ameliorated by pirfenidone administration.
Lung histological data obtained on day 28 of BLM ad￾ministration showed focal fibroplasia with destruction of
the alveolar architecture and interstitial fibrosis of the al￾veolar wall in the group receiving BLM (Figure 1C and
1D) but not in the saline group (Figure 1A and 1B). Ad￾ministration of pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day) for 4 wk
ameliorated the lesions (Figure 1G and 1H). To quantify
the anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone in the lungs of
BLM-treated mice, we determined the extent of lung

fibrosis using quantitative histology according to Ash￾croft’s method on day 28 [19]. Because BLM adminis￾tered with osmotic pumps causes lung fibrosis predomi￾nantly in subpleural regions [20,21], subpleural fibrosis
between the groups was compared using a numerical
scale. Two blinded observers [MI and KK] quantified
fibrosis in 30 random fields (×10) from each section. Pir￾fenidone significantly attenuated the score when admini￾stered in BLM-treated mice (Figure 1I, P < 0.0001).
Moreover, collagen content was quantified in the lungs
to evaluate the anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone. As shown
in Figure 1J, the collagen content in the lungs of BLM￾treated mice was significantly increased compared with that
in saline- or pirfenidone-treated mice, and this increase was
significantly attenuated by pirfenidone administration on
day 28 after BLM treatment (P = 0.0012).
Inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on fibrocyte pool size
in the lungs of BLM-treated mice
Several studies have reported that bone marrow-derived
circulating fibrocytes migrate into the lungs after in￾jury and contribute to fibrosis in BLM-treated mice
[14,17,22]. To test whether pirfenidone regulates fibro￾cyte pool size in the lungs of BLM-treated mice, we ex￾amined the number of fibrocytes, defined as CD45 and
Col-I double-positive cells, using cell staining and FACS
analysis of lung digests on day 14 of BLM treatment
with or without pirfenidone administration in a prophy￾lactic setting. The experimental design is shown in
Figure 2. Fibrocytes were increased from 7.5% (saline
treated) to 26.5% by BLM treatment. This increase was
attenuated to 13.7% by pirfenidone administration
(Table 1). The representative figures of FACS analysis

according to Ashcroft’s method on day 28 to determine anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. Because BLM

using a numerical scale. Pirfenidone administration significantly attenuated the numerical score increased by BLM treatment (*P < 0.0001). (J) The
amount of collagen was quantified to determine the anti-fibrotic effects of pirfenidone in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. The collagen content in the

attenuated by pirfenidone administration on day 28 after BLM treatment (*P = 0.0012). Data are presented as means ± standard error. The experiment
was repeated 3 times on different occasions with 6 mice per group. PFD, pirfenidone.

are presented in Figure 3A–D, and the fibrocyte counts
are shown in Figure 3E.
Immunohistochemistry of CD45 and Col-I for the quantification
of fibrocytes
To confirm the increase in fibrocytes in BLM-treated mice
and its subsequent decrease after pirfenidone administration,
we performed immunohistochemical staining for CD45 and
Col-I to count the number of fibrocytes in lung sections on
day 14 of BLM treatment with or without pirfenidone. In￾creased numbers of fibrocytes expressing CD45 (Figure 4D)
and Col-I (Figure 4E) were observed in BLM-treated mice
(merge, Figure 4F) compared with those in saline-treated
mice (Figure 4A–C). This increase was attenuated by pirfeni￾done administration (Figure 4G–I). In quantitative counts,
CD45 and Col-I double-positive cells recognised as bone
marrow-derived fibrocytes which were stimulated by BLM
treatment were significantly decreased by pirfenidone admin￾istration, as shown in Figure 5 (P = 0.0097).
Effect of pirfenidone on chemokine production in
BLM-induced fibrotic lungs of mice
Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes migrate into BLM￾induced fibrotic lesions in the lungs in response to the
secretion of chemokines, to which fibrocytes respond
chemotactically. In preclinical models of lung fibrosis,
the inhibition of various chemokine receptor/ligand
pathways reduces lung fibrosis, likely due in part to a re￾duction in fibrocyte recruitment [14,17]. Among several
chemokines that participate in the recruitment of fibro￾cytes, CXCL12 and CCL2 play key roles [14,17]. More￾over, in rodents, another monocyte chemoattractant
protein-like chemokine, CCL12, reportedly plays import￾ant roles in fibrocyte recruitment and lung fibrosis de￾velopment [23]. To determine whether the inhibition of
fibrocytes in BLM-induced lung fibrosis is due to the
suppression of these chemokines, we used ELISA to
measure chemokines in the lungs.
As shown in Figure 6A, the production of CCL2 in the
lungs of BLM-treated mice was significantly increased
compared with that in saline- or pirfenidone-treated
mice, and this increase was significantly attenuated by
pirfenidone administration on day 14 after BLM treat￾ment (P = 0.0003). CXCL12 and CCL12 production in
the lungs of BLM-treated mice was also stimulated com￾pared with that in saline-treated mice. CCL12 produc￾tion was also significantly attenuated by pirfenidone as
shown in Figure 6B. Although a trend toward the

attenuation of CXCL12 production by pirfenidone treat￾ment was found, statistical significance was not reached
(Figure 6C).
Immunohistochemistry for CCL2
Immunohistochemical staining for CCL2 was performed
to determine the cellular sources of CCL2 on day 14 of
BLM treatment with or without pirfenidone. Increased
immunoreactivity for CCL2 was observed on alveolar
epithelial cells, terminal and respiratory bronchiolar epi￾thelial cells, and macrophages (Figure 7A–C). Treatment
with pirfenidone attenuated this staining in each section
(Figure 7D–F). These data suggest that alveolar epithelial
cells, terminal and respiratory bronchiolar epithelial

cells, and macrophages in the lungs of BLM-treated
mice are sources of CCL2.
Effect of pirfenidone on macrophages in BAL fluid of
BLM-treated mice in a prophylactic setting
A potential profibrotic role of activated alveolar macro￾phages and their mediators has recently been reported
in the pathogenesis of IPF [24,25]. In support of this hy￾pothesis, the modulation of macrophage activation in
established BLM-induced lung fibrosis reportedly in￾hibits BLM-induced increases in collagen deposition
[26]. Although alveolar macrophages have the potential
to express increased levels of CCL2 after BLM treat￾ment, as observed in this study, the migration of macro￾phages to the lungs is regulated largely by CCL2 in
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis [27], and the CCL2/
chemokine (CC motif ) receptor-2 (CCR2) functional
pathway plays an important role in pulmonary fibrosis
[28]. For assessment of the effect of pirfenidone on
macrophage migration, BAL fluid was collected on day
14 after BLM treatment in the presence or absence of
pirfenidone, and cell differentials were counted. The
number of macrophages in the BLM treatment group
was increased compared with that in saline-treated mice,
and pirfenidone attenuated this increase (Figure 8).

Inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on fibrocyte pool size in
the lungs of BLM-treated mice in a therapeutic setting
Pirfenidone reportedly inhibits fibrosis in the lungs of
BLM-treated mice even when administered during the
fibrotic phase in this model [29]. To examine the inhibi￾tory effect of pirfenidone on fibrocyte pool size in a
therapeutic setting, we began administration of pirfe￾nidone 10 days after BLM treatment, as described in
Figure 9. Mice were then killed on day 21, and FACS
analysis was used to determine the effects of pirfenidone
on fibrocyte pool size. Fibrocytes were increased from
10.1% (saline treated) to 25.6% by BLM treatment. This
increase was attenuated to 17.6% by pirfenidone admin￾istration in a therapeutic setting (Table 2). The represen￾tative results of FACS analysis and fibrocyte counts are
presented in Figure 10.
Chemotaxis assay
To confirm that CCL2 and CCL12 are functional and
that pirfenidone inhibits fibrocyte migration toward
these chemokines, we undertook in vitro chemotaxis as￾says using a Boyden chamber system. Fibrocytes were
cultured as described in Materials and methods, and
CD45-positive cells were selected using magnetic beads.
FACS analysis revealed that the percentages of CD45
and Col-I double-positive cells in the lung culture after
magnetic selection was 75.8% (Figure 11A). As shown in
Figure 11B, 200 and 500 ng/mL of CCL2 stimulated
fibrocyte migration, which was significantly attenuated
by pirfenidone. The dose of CCL2 was comparable to
that previously shown to be active against fibrocytes
[30]. Fibrocyte migration toward CCL12 was not ob￾served with any concentration used in this study (data
not shown).
Inhibitory effect of pirfenidone on the expression of CCR2
messenger RNA (mRNA) in fibrocytes
To explore more thoroughly the mechanisms through
which pirfenidone ameliorates fibrocyte accumulation in
the lungs of mice with BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis,
we investigated CCR2 expression on cultured fibrocytes.
Isolated fibrocytes were cultured in the presence or ab￾sence of pirfenidone, and mRNA expression of CCR2 in
fibrocytes was evaluated with quantitative real-time re￾verse transcriptase PCR. As shown in Figure 12, pirfeni￾done significantly attenuated CCR2 mRNA expression in
cultured fibrocytes (P = 0.0329).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine the role of pirfe￾nidone in the suppression of fibrocyte accumulation in
the lungs in response to systemic administration of BLM
infused with osmotic pumps. We used both ELISA and
immunohistochemical analysis to confirm that pirfeni￾done decreased fibrocyte pool size in BLM-treated mice
lungs via attenuation of both CCL2 and CCL12 produc￾tion. CCL2 expression was localised to alveolar epithelial
cells, bronchiolar epithelial cells, and macrophages in

digests were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on day
14 of BLM treatment. (A) CCL2 production was significantly increased in
BLM-treated mice compared with that in saline- and pirfenidone-treated
mice. Pirfenidone significantly attenuated the production of CCL2 in
BLM-treated mice (P = 0.0003). (B) CCL12 production was also significantly
stimulated by BLM treatment, and pirfenidone administration significantly
attenuated this increase (P < 0.0001). (C) CXCL12 production was increased
in BLM-treated mice compared with that in saline-treated mice. Although
a trend toward attenuation of CXCL12 production by pirfenidone treatment
was found, statistical significance was not reached. The level of each
chemokine in the supernatant of the lung homogenate was standardised
with the wet weight (g) of each lung. PFD, pirfenidone.

the lungs of BLM-treated mice, and expression was at￾tenuated by pirfenidone administration. Moreover, pirfe￾nidone attenuated both fibrocyte migration toward
CCL2 and CCR2 expression on fibrocytes in vitro.
IPF is a relentlessly progressive and fatal disorder of
unknown aetiology with a median survival of 3–5 yr
[31]. Recent studies have suggested that the activation of
chronic epithelial cell injury and subsequent abnormal
tissue repair accompanied by progressive fibrosis cause
IPF [32]. Originally, the local proliferation and differenti￾ation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts were thought to
derive from resident fibroblasts in the presence of a
highly pro-fibrotic cytokine milieu [33]. However, recent
pioneering research has demonstrated several other cel￾lular sources of fibroblasts as possible contributors to
pulmonary fibrosis. One hypothesis regarding the origin
of (myo)fibroblasts in lung fibrosis proposes that these
cells are derived from circulating fibrocytes [34]. Fibro￾cytes present in the peripheral circulation were first
identified a decade ago and have been demonstrated to
compose a minor component of the circulating pool of
leukocytes (less than 1%). They express a characteristic
pattern of markers, including CD45 and Col-I [35]. Sub￾sequent studies have revealed that in response to che￾mokines such as CXCL12 or CCL2, these circulating
fibrocytes traffic to the lungs and mediate fibrosis [14].
Although neutralisation of these chemokines [14,23] or
administration of the mammalian target of rapamycin
inhibitor rapamycin have been shown to reduce this in￾flux of fibrocytes in murine models, the effects of other
clinical agents have not been reported.
Pirfenidone is among the most promising of the lim￾ited therapies available for IPF. Pirfenidone has been
shown to reduce the annual decline of vital capacity in
IPF patients [9,10]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies
have proven that the beneficial effects of pirfenidone are
mediated by its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory
properties [11,36,37]; however, the effect of pirfenidone
on fibrocytes has not been investigated. In the present

localisation of CCL2 in lung sections on day 14 of treatment with bleomycin (BLM) (A–C) and BLM + pirfenidone (D–F). Representative images
from alveolar regions, respiratory bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles are shown. Increased immunoreactivity for CCL2 was observed on
alveolar epithelial (AE) cells, terminal and respiratory bronchiolar epithelial cells (arrowheads), and macrophages (arrows) with BLM treatment
(A–C). Treatment with pirfenidone attenuated this staining in each section (D–F). Magnification, ×10. PFD, pirfenidone.

macrophages was increased in BLM-treated mice compared with that

study, we demonstrated that the increased fibrocyte pool
size in the lung digests of BLM-treated mice was de￾creased by pirfenidone administration in both prophylac￾tic and therapeutic settings. We confirmed that in a
prophylactic setting, this reduction was mediated by the
inhibition of CCL2 and CCL12 production and the par￾tial inhibition of CXCL12 production, which are stimu￾lated by lung injuries [14,23]. In a therapeutic setting,
pirfenidone also reduced fibrocyte pool size in the lungs,
and this result may reflect the effect of pirfenidone ad￾ministered to IPF patients with established pulmonary
fibrosis.
In this study, pirfenidone clearly inhibited CCL2 produc￾tion stimulated by BLM treatment. Several studies have
demonstrated increased CCL2 in the circulation and BAL
fluid of IPF patients [38,39], and the correlation of serum
CCL2 levels with the clinical course of IPF has also been
demonstrated [39]. CCL2 is a potent mononuclear cell
chemoattractant mediated by its receptor, CCR2, which is
expressed by numerous cell types, including monocytes,
macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts [40]. We con￾firmed that macrophages, alveolar epithelial cells, and bron￾chiolar epithelial cells were positive for CCL2 through
immunohistochemical analysis in the lungs of BLM-treated
mice. This positivity was attenuated by pirfenidone treat￾ment. CCL2 reportedly has the potential to promote fibro￾cyte differentiation into myofibroblast phenotypes in cul￾ture, as detected by increased α-smooth muscle actin
expression [30]. Blockade of the CCL2/CCR2 biological axis
may be an essential anti-fibrotic property of pirfenidone. A
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the anti-CCL2 anti￾body has been performed for patients with IPF, which em￾phasises the importance of the inhibition of this axis.
Fibrocytes derived from bone marrow are known to mi￾grate to sites of tissue injury chemotactically, and CCL2
has been demonstrated to stimulate human fibrocyte mi￾gration in vitro [14,40]. Because it is unknown whether
pirfenidone attenuates the migration of fibrocytes toward
CCL2, we performed an in vitro chemotaxis assay using a
Boyden chamber system. Our results revealed that CCL2
stimulated fibrocyte migration, and pirfenidone attenuated
the migration with statistical significance. Although the
detailed mechanisms through which pirfenidone attenu￾ates fibrocyte migration have yet to be studied, the results
of the chemotaxis assay may partially explain the decrease
in fibrocyte pool size after pirfenidone administration in
BLM-treated mice lungs.
CCL12 is also the ligand for the CCR2 receptor in
the mouse and is reportedly responsible for fibrocyte
Figure 9 Outline of experimental design in a therapeutic setting. Osmotic pumps containing 200 μL saline with or without bleomycin (BLM;
100 mg/kg) were implanted subcutaneously according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BLM was infused constantly from day 0 to day 6.
Pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered every 12 h from day 10 to day 20. On day 21 of BLM injection, the mice were killed and
their lungs were removed for analysis. Each experiment was performed with at least 6 mice per group.

recruitment and enhanced fibrotic response [23]. In this
study, pirfenidone also clearly inhibited CCL12 produc￾tion stimulated by BLM treatment; however, CCL12 did
not stimulate fibrocyte migration. In a previous study,
50 ng/mL of CCL12 significantly stimulated migration of
fibrocytes derived from fluorescein isothiocyanate￾induced pulmonary fibrosis [23]. In the present study,
however, cultured fibrocytes for chemotaxis were derived
from BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and discrete re￾sponses toward CCL12 may be due in part to the differ￾ence in stimulation used to create the fibrocytes.
The biological axis of the receptor CXCR4 and its lig￾and CXCL12 also plays an important role in the homing
of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells [41], and a dir￾ect correlation exists between plasma and lung levels of
CXCL12 and circulating and lung fibrocyte numbers in
human IPF [42]. In this study, we found a trend in which
BLM treatment increased CXCL12 production; however,
statistical significance was not achieved. Significant
BLM-induced increase in CXCL12 has been reported in
several studies, many of which used intratracheal or
intravenous injection for the administration of BLM
[11,14,43]. Alzet osmotic pumps were used to infuse
BLM in this study, which might have caused the com￾paratively mild increase in CXCL12 that differed from
increases reported in previous studies. Pirfenidone ap￾peared to attenuate this mild increase. However, com￾pared with the intratracheal BLM model, the osmotic
pump method produced a greater increase in lung hy￾droxyproline after 6 wk and caused confluent subpleural
fibrosis involving almost 50% of the pleural space (com￾pared with 10–15% in the intratracheal BLM model);
neither model fully reproduces the human disease
[20,21]. Although intratracheal, intravenous, and sub￾cutaneous injections are associated with disadvantages
including variable distribution of lesions, high mortality,

examined with fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. (A) CD45 and Col-I double-positive fibrocytes in lung digests were examined using the
logical gates depicted on day 21 of bleomycin (BLM) treatment. (B) CD45 and Col-I double-positive fibrocytes in lung digests from BLM-treated
mice administered pirfenidone from day 10 to day 20 were examined on day 21. Pirfenidone administration decreased CD45 and Col-I double-positive
fibrocytes from 29.9% to 22.1%. Representative runs are shown for each group. (C) Pirfenidone also regulated the absolute cell number of fibrocytes in
the lungs of BLM-treated mice on day 21 in a therapeutic setting. Fibrocytes were increased from 1.3 × 104 cells/mL (saline treated) to 3.2 × 105 cells/mL
by BLM treatment and attenuated to 1.1 × 105 cells/mL by pirfenidone administration. Data represent the means ± standard error from 2 independent
experiments with 6 mice for each group. PFD, pirfenidone.

and a requirement for multiple procedures, the osmotic
pump method of BLM treatment reportedly avoids these
difficulties [13]. Moreover, although no completely satis￾factory animal model of human IPF is available, the
BLM-induced model is relatively well characterised and
exhibits certain features of the human disease. Taken to￾gether, the observed effects of pirfenidone on fibrocytes
as well as chemokines in vivo are considered essential
actions of pirfenidone in humans.
In the current study, the inhibition of BLM-induced fi￾brosis by pirfenidone was incomplete despite significant
inhibition of fibrocytes by pirfenidone. Although it is
postulated that just over half of the lung fibroblast popu￾lation can be accounted for by fibrocytes and EMT in
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis models [44], resident
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the lungs may contrib￾ute significantly to the remainder, together with cells de￾rived from endothelial- or mesothelial-mesenchymal
transitions [45,46]. The inhibitory effects of pirfenidone
on lung fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation or
other cellular sources of fibroblasts including EMT are
not fully understood. Moreover, in this study, inhibition
of fibrocyte accumulation in the lungs was significant on
day 14 after BLM administration; however, the effect of
pirfenidone on fibrocyte was less prominent on day 21
in a therapeutic setting. Therefore, we speculate that sig￾nificant inhibition of fibrocytes by pirfenidone does not
necessarily result in complete inhibition of lung fibrosis
on day 28. Furthermore, the inhibition of chemokines
and chemokine receptor CCR2 by pirfenidone was moder￾ate; however, fibrocytes were strongly inhibited despite the
moderate effects on these factors. We speculate that the
inhibitory effects of pirfenidone on chemokines and che￾mokine receptor expression together with the inhibitory
effects on fibrocyte migration synergistically inhibited the
accumulation of fibrocytes in the lungs, especially when
pirfenidone was administered prophylactically.
In the current study, we examined fibrocytes on day
14 of BLM treatment. In BLM-treated mice, marked
lung oedema was present at day 10, and lung hydroxy￾proline levels started to increase on day 10 and tended

receptor-2 (CCR2) in fibrocytes. Isolated fibrocytes were cultured
in the presence or absence of pirfenidone (100 μg/mL) for 48 h.
Then, total RNA was extracted and converted to complementary
DNA. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed
to evaluate CCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. CCR2 mRNA
was significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (*P = 0.0329). Data are

in triplicate. PFD, pirfenidone.

(A) The percentage of CD45 and collagen-I (Col-I) double-positive cells in the lung culture after magnetic selection was 75.8% on fluorescence￾activated cell sorter analysis. A representative figure from 4 separate experiments is shown. (B) Fibrocyte (CD45-positive mesenchymal cell)
chemotaxis was examined using a Boyden chamber assay system. Medium alone or medium containing chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2;
100, 200, and 500 ng/mL) was added to the lower chamber, and fibrocytes with or without pirfenidone (100 μg/mL) were added to the upper
chamber. After incubation overnight at 37°C in a moist 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere incubator, transmigration cells were counted. CCL2 at 200
and 500 ng/mL stimulated fibrocyte migration, which was significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (P = 0.0232 and 0.0025, respectively). Data are
means ± standard error from 4 separate experiments, each assayed for chemotaxis in triplicate. PFD, pirfenidone.

to increase further by day 28 [11]. Because lung fibrosis
becomes apparent by day 28 of BLM treatment, the ex￾tent of fibrosis on day 14 appears to be immature. How￾ever, because several studies have examined fibrocytes
between days 14 and 21 of BLM treatment [14,22]—crit￾ical time points before fibrosis is established—we evalu￾ated the effect of pirfenidone on fibrocytes on day 14 in
a prophylactic setting and on day 21 in a therapeutic set￾ting with conclusive results.
In conclusion, we clearly demonstrated that pirfeni￾done decreased fibrocyte pool size in BLM-treated mice
lungs via the attenuation of CCL2 and CCL12 produc￾tion. Inhibition of fibrocyte migration into lung tissue is
considered a mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of pirfe￾nidone. This study is the first to investigate the effects of
pirfenidone on fibrocytes, which are currently consid￾ered essential to the pathogenesis of IPF.
