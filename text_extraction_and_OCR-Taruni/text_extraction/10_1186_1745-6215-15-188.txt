Abstract
Background: Surgical site infections are the most common hospital-acquired infections among surgical patients.
The administration of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces the risk of surgical site infections . The optimal
timing of this procedure is still a matter of debate. While most studies suggest that it should be given as close to
the incision time as possible, others conclude that this may be too late for optimal prevention of surgical site
infections. A large observational study suggests that surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered
74 to 30 minutes before surgery. The aim of this article is to report the design and protocol of a randomized
controlled trial investigating the optimal timing of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis.
Methods/Design: In this bi-center randomized controlled trial conducted at two tertiary referral centers in
Switzerland, we plan to include 5,000 patients undergoing general, oncologic, vascular and orthopedic trauma
procedures. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups: one receiving surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis
in the anesthesia room (75 to 30 minutes before incision) and the other receiving surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis
in the operating room (less than 30 minutes before incision). We expect a significantly lower rate of surgical site
infections with surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis administered more than 30 minutes before the scheduled incision.
The primary outcome is the occurrence of surgical site infections during a 30-day follow-up period (one year with
an implant in place). When assuming a 5% surgical site infection risk with administration of surgical antimicrobial
prophylaxis in the operating room, the planned sample size has an 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction
for surgical site infections of 33% when administering surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis in the anesthesia room
(with a two-sided type I error of 5%). We expect the study to be completed within three years.
Discussion: The results of this randomized controlled trial will have an important impact on current international
guidelines for infection control strategies in the hospital. Moreover, the results of this randomized controlled trial
are of significant interest for patient safety and healthcare economics.
Trial registration: This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT01790529.

Background
The importance of surgical research for the prevention of
surgical site infections
Surgical site infections (SSI) account for 14% to 16% of
all nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients and are
considered the most common form of nosocomial infec￾tion among surgical patients [1]. Despite a variety of dif￾ferent prevention measures, as many as 5% of all patients
undergoing surgery develop SSI, which lead to additional
morbidity and mortality [2-4]. Patients with SSI require a
longer hospital stay, more nursing care, and often read￾missions with additional surgery [5-8]. The combined
additional direct and indirect costs of treating SSI are sub￾stantial [9-12]. Hospitals are under pressure to reduce
costs, and efforts to decrease the rate of SSI have there￾fore become a matter of increasing interest for surgeons,
operating room nurses, anesthesiologists, infection control
professionals and healthcare epidemiologists [13]. Now￾adays, SSI are considered to reflect the quality of care in a
hospital, as they are potentially preventable complications
directly linked to surgery. However, many of the current
recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization are
based on evidence from observational studies in the ab￾sence of confirmatory trials [1,14].
Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis
The introduction of routine surgical antimicrobial
prophylaxis (SAP) was a breakthrough in the prevention
of SSI [15]. Today, SAP is administered in surgical units
on a daily basis. Based on evidence from observational
and randomized controlled trials (RCT), there is wide￾spread agreement for the use of SAP before all gastro￾intestinal, oropharyngeal and gynecological procedures
[15-23]. There is ongoing controversy about the use of
SAP for ‘clean’ operations, in which the absolute number
of infections is low and the number of administrations
of SAP needed to prevent one infection is high. It is well
accepted for the following clean surgeries, in which the
consequence of any infection is severe: orthopedic pros￾thesis placement, vascular surgery, open-heart surgery
and neurosurgery procedures [24-33]. A reduction in in￾fection rates is well documented for other clean opera￾tions such as breast, varicose vein and herniorrhaphy
procedures [34-38]. However, in these procedures the
morbidity of the infection is generally low and the bene￾fits of SAP must be balanced against its costs and pos￾sible adverse effects.
Several antibiotics have been shown to reduce the inci￾dence of SSI. Many hospitals, especially in the US, use very
complex SAP regimes with a variety of antimicrobial drugs
that have different pharmacokinetics depending on the type
of surgery performed [15,16,39,40]. Current guidelines,
however, suggest that single-shot administration of a first￾or second-generation cephalosporin is sufficient for optimal
prevention of SSI in the absence of high rates of resistant
bacteria [41]. Due to a limited anaerobic activity of most
cephalosporins, treatment is supplemented with metro￾nidazole where indicated. The time interval to motivate
redosing is generally set at four hours. Therefore, in sev￾eral hospitals in Switzerland, including the University
Hospital of Basel and the Hospital of Aarau, SAP consists
of single-shot administration of cefuroxime (a second￾generation cephalosporin), combined with metronidazole
in colorectal and proctologic surgery, that is repeated in
operations exceeding four hours.
When to administer surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis?
Before the late 1960s, most prophylactic antibiotics were
administered after the end of a surgical procedure and
were found to be ineffective [42]. In 1961, Burke [43]
showed the timing of SAP to be crucial in animals. Sub￾sequent studies in humans suggested that adequate tis￾sue levels of an appropriate antibiotic during surgery
were essential [21,44-47]. The observational landmark
study by Classen and colleagues [48] in 1992 provided
the basis for the antimicrobial agents to be administered
within two hours before skin incision. Other authors
narrowed the optimal window for SAP to less than
60 minutes before skin incision [49,50]. Importantly, two
large prospective studies observed the lowest risk of SSI
when SAP was given within 30 minutes prior to incision,
and the National Surgical Infection Prevention Project
simply recommends administering SAP as close to the
incision time as possible [51-53]. Similar statements are
made in European guidelines [54,55].
However, despite the obvious importance of infection
control by SAP, none of the recommendations on the
optimal timing is backed by evidence obtained in an
RCT. The historic study by Classen and colleagues [48]
was conducted when it was standard practice to admin￾ister antibiotics to all patients for at least 24 hours,
which was extended to ≥48 hours in more than 80% of
cases. Moreover, the antibiotics administered had widely
varying half-lives. Consequently, the Classen et al. time
window may not be appropriate for an optimal preven￾tion of SSI as practiced today with single-shot regimes.
In addition, there is little evidence in the literature to
suggest that tissue levels of cefuroxime could reach the
minimum inhibitory concentration within a few minutes
after administration. Different authors have attained ap￾propriate tissue levels of cefuroxime anywhere from 20
to 90 minutes after intravenous application [56-58]. The
translocation of skin microorganisms into the wound
during incision is the first vulnerable phase of surgery,
and administering SAP only a few minutes before inci￾sion might not be optimal to achieve the tissue levels re￾quired to prevent SSI.

http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/15/1/188

Several recent studies of other antimicrobial agents with
different pharmacokinetics support this hypothesis. In vivo
microdialysis, for example, is a new development that al￾lows the measurement of continuous unbound antibiotic
concentrations in muscular and subcutaneous interstitial
fluid during surgery. Hutschala et al. [59] described this
in vivo approach of microdialysis to measure continuous
tissue levels of cefazolin. Importantly, the authors state
that ‘Cefazolin should be administered at least 60 mi￾nutes before skin incision to guarantee for optimal tissue
concentration at the beginning of surgery. Vast inter￾individual differences were observed for the time required
to reach maximum interstitial concentrations. So it seems
reasonable to administer the prophylactic antibiotic as
early as possible before skin incision’ [59].
Two recent prospective observational studies of other
antimicrobial agents with different pharmacokinetics are
noteworthy [60,61]. In one, the administration of vanco￾mycin 16 to 60 minutes before incision in coronary artery
bypass surgery was associated with the lowest risk of SSI
[60]. The other study showed that the rate of SSI after un￾complicated open appendectomy is lower when the anti￾biotic is administered more than one hour versus one
hour or less before surgery [61]. Finally, the results of an
observational cohort study performed at the University
Hospital of Basel suggest that the ideal timing of SAP is
between 74 and 30 minutes before skin incision [62].
Relevant ongoing research
As of 27 January 2014, there were 198 studies on ‘surgical
site infection AND prevention’ or ‘surgical site infection
AND prophylaxis’ - excluding the present one - registered
on ClinicalTrials.gov, 88 of which were open. There
were 122 studies found using the terms ‘surgical site
infection AND antibiotic’, all of which were covered by
the above search criteria. Finally, there were 75 studies
found using ‘surgical site infection AND prophylaxis
AND antibiotic’.
None of these 198 studies investigates the incidence of
SSI as a function of SAP timing. Instead, most of them as￾sess the impact of multiple SSI prevention measures on
the risk of SSI, such as nasal decontamination, surgical
hand antisepsis, preoperative patients’ skin cleansing, hair
clipping, supplemental oxygen, local warming and antibac￾terial sutures. Some studies focus on different aspects of
SAP, such as the overall efficacy of different types, doses,
durations or ways of applications of SAP in specific subsets
of patients, others assess the impact of quality improve￾ment programs on compliance with current guidelines.
In summary, SSI are frequent surgical complications
that have an important impact on healthcare costs. SAP
prevents SSI and has therefore become a main stem of
surgical infection control in many surgical interventions.
Current guidelines for the correct timing of SAP,
however, are still based on observational and pharmacoki￾netic studies. Such studies have recently achieved discord￾ant results. A well-conducted RCT seems warranted to
obtain a clear answer on the optimal timing. There is
currently no ongoing or planned trial registered on Clin￾icalTrials.gov to address this question. The use of a single￾shot single-drug SAP regime at two tertiary referral
centers in Switzerland provides an ideal setting to plan
and conduct an RCT on the optimal timing of SAP.
Current state of own research in the field
In a quality assessment study conducted at the University
Hospital of Basel, we prospectively followed 6,283 consecu￾tive general, oncologic, vascular and orthopedic trauma
surgery procedures closely for evidence of SSI, and then
analyzed the dataset for the influence of various SSI risk
factors. The a priori hypothesis of this study was that the
timing of SAP had a significant impact on the occurrence
of SSI. The lowest rates of SSI were observed with the anti￾biotics being administered between 74 and 30 minutes
before surgery, and the association remained virtually
unchanged when controlling for patient and procedural
risk factors for SSI [62].
Within that cohort study, a matched case-control
study was conducted on the economic impact of in￾hospital SSI at the University Hospital of Basel. The
mean additional hospital cost per SSI was 19,638 CHF
(95% confidence interval 8,492 to 30,784 l) or 12,765
Euro (95% confidence interval 5,520 to 20,010) [63]. Fur￾ther analyses of this cohort study suggest that glove per￾foration is associated with an increased SSI risk in the
absence of SAP, but show no statistically significant asso￾ciations between transfusion, anemia or tutorial assist￾ance and the risk of SSI [64-66]. A review of the
microbiological features of SSI in this series demon￾strates the absence of multiresistant germs and validate
the continuous use of single-shot single-drug SAP with
cefuroxime (plus metronidazole in colorectal and proc￾tologic surgery) [67]. Finally, a secondary analysis has
been conducted to assess the sensitivity of our clinicians
SSI surveillance system to register in-hospital SSI [68].
Aims
The final goal of this present project is to reduce the
rate of SSI by providing level I evidence on the optimal
timing of the administration of SAP in general, onco￾logic, vascular and orthopedic trauma surgery. We ex￾pect that evidence to influence international guidelines
for SAP. The hypothesis to be tested is that the risk of
SSI is significantly lower with cefuroxime (plus metro￾nidazole in colorectal surgery) applied in the anesthesia
room (75 to 30 minutes before surgery) as compared to
its administration in the operating room (within the final
30 minutes before surgery) [62].

Methods/Design
Study design and sites
This bi-center prospective RCT is being conducted at
the University Hospital of Basel and the Hospital of
Aarau, two tertiary referral centers in Switzerland. The
trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the
identifier NCT01790529.
Patients
Eligible patients are informed about the study by a mem￾ber of the surgical team and receive a patient information
sheet explaining the rationale and procedures of the study.
The information sheet is available in Albanian, English,
French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian,
Spanish and Turkish. Patient information and recruitment
is continuously assisted and supported by members of the
study team. Written informed consent is obtained from
each patient prior to randomization (Figure 1).
Inclusion criteria
Inpatients aged 18 years or older undergoing general,
oncologic, vascular and orthopedic trauma procedures
with an indication for SAP according to clinical stan￾dards are eligible for this study.
Clinical standards for SAP administration are based on
CDC guidelines for surgical wound classification as fol￾lows: class I (clean) involving an implant (for example,
hernia mesh repair and trauma surgery), and most major
vascular and breast surgery procedures; class II (clean￾contaminated) procedures (for example, colorectal, small
intestinal, gastroesophageal and biliary surgery); and
class III (contaminated) procedures when the source of
infection is surgically removed, obviating the need for
xantibiotic therapy (for example, surgery for uncompli￾cated appendicitis, cholecystitis) [1]. SAP is not indicated
for CDC class IV (dirty-contaminated) wounds. This
wound class suggests that the organisms causing postop￾erative infection were present in the operative field before
the operation, and patients are frequently receiving thera￾peutic antimicrobial agents perioperatively for established
infections. Therefore, neither the term SAP nor the term
SSI is correct in such procedures.
Exclusion criteria
Patients are excluded on the following bases:
 Outpatient surgery
 Contraindication for study drugs, in particular
penicillin type I allergy
Figure 1 Study flow chart. CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; SAP: surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis.
Mujagic et al. Trials 2014, 15:188 Page 4 of 11
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/15/1/188

 Pre-existing antibiotic therapy within 14 days
of surgery
 Any doubt that the patient can make the
decision to participate fully informed because
of cognitive impairment, such as in critically
ill patients or those with dementia
 Combined operations between general, oncologic,
vascular or orthopedic trauma surgery with other
surgical disciplines not participating in this trial
 Indication for SAP other than cefuroxime and/or
metronidazole
 Patients who have already been included in other
interventional studies, unless specific permission has
been granted in accordance with local ethics
committee guidelines
 Emergency procedures with planned incision within
two hours after the surgeon indicated the procedure.
In the case of the latter criterion, emergency proce￾dures within two hours may not allow proper patient in￾formation and randomization and we want to exclude
any risk that the procedure could be delayed by partici￾pation in this study. Patients scheduled for less urgent
but non-elective procedures with planned incision more
than two hours after the time of indication are eligible
for participation in this study since evidence for the cor￾rect timing of SAP in such procedures is needed and
cannot simply be deduced from elective procedures.
Thus, the results of this trial potentially have an impact
on the prevention of SSI in patients undergoing such
procedures in the future. However, if obtaining appropri￾ate informed consent is jeopardized by the urgency of
the procedure, the patient will be excluded and data on
the reason for individual exclusion will be collected.
Randomization and intervention
After written informed consent is obtained from eligible
patients, they are randomized electronically and strati￾fied by hospital, according to pre-existing randomization
lists. Randomization results are presented both electron￾ically and printed to the anesthesiologist responsible for
SAP administration. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ra￾tio to have SAP administered in the anesthesia room,
which is located next to the actual operating room (arm
A), versus in the operating room itself (arm B). Patients
in arm A receive the antibiotics between arrival in the
anesthesia room and transfer to the operating room, cor￾responding to the time window of 75 to 30 minutes be￾fore the scheduled incision. Patients in arm B receive the
antibiotics between arrival in the operating room and
the time of incision, corresponding to the time window
of less than 30 minutes to 0 minutes before the sched￾uled incision, preferably as close to the incision time as
possible. SAP is administered by the anesthetic team to
all patients via single-shot, intravenous infusion of 1.5 g
or 3 g for patients ≥80 kg of cefuroxime in 100 ml of a
0.9% sodium chloride solution within 5 minutes and is
combined with metronidazole (500 mg or 1,000 mg for
patients ≥80 kg intravenous infusion, within 5 minutes)
in colorectal patients, who receive no additional intra￾luminal antibiotics. Hence, the duration of the infusion
is highly standardized. The anesthesiologist or anesthetic
nurse who administers SAP records the exact time at
which the infusion starts. Until 29 April 2013, corre￾sponding to the inclusion of the first 221 patients, we in￾stead recorded the time that the infusion ended. We had
to make this amendment for feasibility reasons after
consulting several opinion leaders in the field and the
corresponding literature, and confirming that the stand￾ard in the US is to report when the infusion starts. In
operations that last more than four hours, SAP is re￾administered every four hours after the first dose ac￾cording to clinical standards. In patients with impaired
renal function, this re-dose will be adapted according to
the creatinine clearance.
Study endpoints
The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of
any SSI within 30 days after surgery (within one year after
implant surgery). SSI are defined as incisional (either
superficial or deep) infection or organ-space infection ac￾cording to CDC criteria [1]. Superficial incisional SSI in￾volve skin and subcutaneous tissues only, common stitch
mini-abscesses are excluded; deep incisional infections in￾volve fascia and muscle; and organ-space infections in￾volve any organ or space other than the incised layer of
body wall that was opened or manipulated during surgery.
The operating surgeon, his team and ward residents,
and the patients are unaware of assignments to treat￾ment groups and are therefore blinded for treatment al￾location. The operating surgeon and his team perform
routine wound surveillance according to clinical stan￾dards including diagnosis and treatment of SSI. The resi￾dent in charge of the patient on the ward is responsible
for registration of SSI, cross-checked by the attending
surgeon in charge. In addition, inpatients are seen regu￾larly by members of the study team. This ensures appro￾priate sensitivity to detect in-hospital events. Clinicians
are not allowed to overrule study team members in arbi￾trary situations about diagnosing of SSI.
For post-discharge follow-up, trained investigators
blinded for treatment allocation contact all patients
30 days after surgery by telephone. The past or present
occurrence of SSI is assessed using a standardized ques￾tionnaire, and the physician who performed post￾discharge clinical follow-up is identified. Whenever
ongoing SSI are suspected, patients are investigated in
the outpatient clinic of the two involved study centers,
Mujagic et al. Trials 2014, 15:188 Page 5 of 11
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/15/1/188

clinically relevant microbiological samples are cultured
as needed, and the patient receives standard treatment.
Whenever the telephone assessment suggests past SSI,
primary care physicians are contacted and outpatient
charts reviewed to gain additional information for val￾idation of the event as described below.
In case of implant surgery, an additional monitoring
assessment is performed one year after surgery, covering
the mandatory follow-up period of one year as defined
by CDC [1].
To ensure appropriate specificity, all cases of SSI are
validated by a board certified infectious disease specialist
who is blinded for the intervention, based on a compre￾hensive review of patient history, clinical findings,
microbiology results and follow-up data.
Secondary endpoints of this study are all-cause 30-day
mortality and length of hospital stay. In addition, we
plan to evaluate the SSI-related economic burden in a
matched case-control study nested within this RCT.
Patient and procedure characteristics
The selection of demographics and assessment of pa￾tients’ health profiles are in accordance with the design
used in our observational study [62], including all rele￾vant patient characteristics, as well as preoperative la￾boratory values and factors that might influence wound
healing. These involve, but are not limited to, American
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, number of co￾morbidities on admission, smoking status, diabetes mel￾litus, immunosuppressive drugs, body mass index,
preoperative albumin, wound class, type and duration of
surgery, experience of the surgical team, surgical spe￾cialty, intraoperative core temperature, adherence to
aseptic technique, and emergency procedure. The Study
on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control and the
National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System
(NNIS) SSI risk indices are based on some of these vari￾ables and will be calculated for each patient.
Study management and administration
Data management and monitoring is supported by the
Clinical Trial Unit of the University Hospital of Basel.
Source data of every study participant are entered into
an electronic data capturing system (eOPPS/ISOP; Protec￾Data AG, Boswil, Switzerland) and secondarily transferred
into the study data management system SecuTrial® (inter￾Active Systems GmbH, Berlin, Germany).
Quality control measures
Monitoring
Continuous central and on-site monitoring of the study
is performed by the Clinical Trial Unit for quality con￾trol and assurance purposes; to evaluate the progress of
the study; to verify the accuracy and completeness of
case report forms (CRFs) ; to ensure that all protocol re￾quirements are met, and all applicable local authority
regulations and investigator’s obligations are being ful￾filled; and to resolve any inconsistency in the study re￾cords. Monitoring will consist of one initiation visit
(12 hours), two monitoring visits (two days each) per
year and one close-out visit (12 hours) each per center.
Sample size considerations and statistical analyses
Sample size consideration
We base our sample size consideration on the planned
1:1 ratio between the two groups of patients (SAP ad￾ministered 75 to 30 minutes (arm A) versus less than
30 minutes to 0 minutes (arm B) before surgery), ac￾cording to the results of our observational study con￾ducted in the years 2000 to 2001 at the University
Hospital of Basel [62]. In this study, an average SSI rate
of 4.7% in 3,836 general, oncologic, vascular and ortho￾pedic trauma surgery procedures was observed. This rate
varied between 4.7% and 6.8% with SAP given between
29 and 0 minutes before incision, and between 2.4% and
3.4% with SAP given 75 to 30 minutes prior to incision.
The main scenario for sample size calculations was that
administration of SAP 75 to 30 minutes before surgery
(in the anesthesia room) will result in a 33% relative re￾duction of SSI risk and that SAP administration less
than 30 minutes before surgery (in the operating room)
will result in a SSI rate of 5%. We therefore plan to
randomize 5,000 patients in a 1:1 ratio, thus resulting in
two groups of 2,500 patients each. Sample size calcula￾tions were conducted using the ‘sampsi’ command of
Stata Software Version 11 with a power of 80% and a
two-sided type I error of 5%.
Statistical analyses
In order to analyze the difference in SSI occurrence be￾tween the two timing groups, logistic regression models
will be used with the treatment group as the main expos￾ure variable. The main analysis will be an intention-to￾treat analysis. In secondary analyses, the logistic regression
model will include the following known and suspected
baseline risk factors for SSI: wound classification, ASA
score, NNIS score, age, body mass index categories, pres￾ence of diabetes, smoking status, adherence to aseptic
technique, and experience of the surgical team.
Additional analyses of the study will assess whether
the difference of SSI risk in the two timing groups differ
in specific subsets of patients: age (≥65 versus <65 years),
body mass index (≥30 versus <30 kg/m2
), diabetes (with
versus without), and previous or current smoker (yes
versus no). The rationale for these analyses is that we
suspect the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs to be
different in these subgroups. This might have an impact
on the efficacy of SAP in the relevant timing categories.
Mujagic et al. Trials 2014, 15:188 Page 6 of 11
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/15/1/188

Descriptive analyses will show the difference in the
distribution of exact timing by randomization group and
further analyses will focus on the detailed association of
the exact timing of SAP with SSI risk. These latter ana￾lyses will be of observational character.
Interim analysis
One interim analysis is planned after 2,500 patients. For
this interim analysis, the outcome will be 30-day SSI
risk. Decisions to stop will be taken using a fully prob￾abilistic approach [69]. Briefly, we will calculate the pre￾dictive probability to obtain a statistically significant
difference between the two arms at the end of the study.
If this predictive probability is less than 5%, we will stop
the trial for futility. For illustration, this will occur if the
observed risk ratio in the interim analysis (SAP in
anesthesia room versus SAP in operating room) is
exactly 1 with 100 SSI in both study arms with 1,250 pa￾tients per arm. After 2,500 patients, this would result in
an estimate of the risk ratio of 1 with a 95% confidence
interval from 0.77 to 1.31. The predictive probability to
obtain a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) be￾tween the two arms is 4.6% at the end of the study (that
is, after the next 2,500 patients in both arms) and thus
the trial would be stopped for futility. If the predictive
probability to obtain a P-value of less than 4.5% at the
end of the study is more (or equal) than 95%, we will
stop the trial early for benefit. If not stopped early for
superiority, the study continues to full length and a P￾value of less than 4.5% is necessary to call a final result
statistically significant. The overall type I error for this
superiority stopping rule is 4.9% and was estimated
using simulations of the scenario of identical SSI risk in
two study arms of 5%.
Ethical considerations
Participation in this trial is strictly voluntary, and pa￾tients are allowed to exit the trial at any point without
explanation. All eligible patients are provided an infor￾mation sheet describing the study with sufficient infor￾mation for them to make an informed decision about
their participation in this study. In addition, patients will
be informed in detail directly by members of the study
team. Patients will be excluded if receipt of adequate in￾formed consent is jeopardized by cognitive impairment
or the urgency of the procedure.
The study protocol, patients’ information sheets and
informed consents and their translations were approved
by the two respective local ethics committees (‘Ethik￾kommission beider Basel’ and ‘Kantonale Ethikkommis￾sion Kanton Aargau’). Moreover, insurance coverage of
general liability has been obtained by both study centers.
Patients who decline to participate in this study are
treated according to clinical standards. This includes the
administration of SAP in one of the two timing categor￾ies. However, these patients will not be included and no
study-specific follow-up will be performed.
Participants’ confidentiality
The participants’ confidentiality is maintained at all times.
For confidentiality reasons, CRFs must not contain any
personal data of study participants. Personnel from the
sponsor and regulatory authorities and members of the
ethics committees are obliged to respect confidentiality
and to refrain from divulging the participants’ identity or
any other personal information they might be aware of.
Source data in the hospital’s electronic patient information
systems are secured by personal passwords and handled
with respect to medical secrecy.
Archiving and data retention
The investigator will maintain all study-related records,
such as CRFs, medical records, laboratory reports, in￾formed consent documents, safety reports, information
regarding participants who discontinued, and other per￾tinent data. All records are to be retained by the investi￾gator as long as required by the applicable laws and
regulatory requirements (10 years). Thereafter, all data
will be destroyed.
The only parameters exclusively acquired for study
purposes are the result of randomization and whether
the 30-day follow-up (one year if an implant is in situ)
has been performed or not.
The study is conducted in compliance with this proto￾col and according to Good Clinical Practice standards as
well as legal regulations.
Discussion
There is abundant literature on SAP and its benefits.
However, this is the first RCT addressing the issue of
exact timing of SAP. Therefore, the aim of this RCT is
to provide level I evidence for optimal SAP timing,
which will eventually lead to an appropriate high-grade
recommendation. The results of this RCT will poten￾tially have an important impact on current international
guidelines for this universal infection control strategy
and their implementation is highly likely to reduce SSI
rates all over the world.
Nowadays, SSI are considered to reflect the quality of
care in a hospital, as they are potentially preventable
complications directly linked to surgery. SSI are a major
cause of surgical patient morbidity and mortality, and
the results of this RCT may translate into a significant
improvement of patient safety in the future.
Furthermore, health systems are increasingly experi￾encing pressure to reduce costs. An estimate of the re￾sources that may be saved by reducing the SSI-related
heavy burden on patients and healthcare providers have

been presented previously [63]. Hence, this RCT has
the potential to become a matter of significant intere￾st in terms of national and international healthcare
economics.
Trial status
The trial including all respective documents was ap￾proved by both local ethics committees by July 2012.
The core study team members including study nurses
were recruited and trained by November 2012. Anesthe￾siologists who administer SAP were trained in January
2013. The initiation visit by the Clinical Trial Unit took
place in February 2013. The first patient was randomized
at the University Hospital Basel on 21 February 2013. As
of 18 February 2014, 1,492 patients have been random￾ized at the University Hospital Basel.
Patient recruitment at the second study center, the Hos￾pital Aarau, started on 7 August 2013. As of 18 February
2014, 609 patients have been randomized. In total, the
study centers have randomized 2,101 patients as of 18
February 2013.
We expect to enroll the calculated sample size of
2,500 patients per intervention arm (5,000 patients total)
within a two to three year time period at the two study
sites. This is realistic as both hospitals together perform
more than 10,000 general, oncologic, vascular and ortho￾pedic trauma surgery procedures per year, of which
about two thirds include SAP.
Post-discharge follow-up extends the study period for
30 days after the last patient undergoes surgery (one
year if an implant is in place). Thorough data cleaning
and validation of registered SSI by board certified infec￾tious disease specialists occur continuously during the
study period and will be completed soon thereafter.

Authors’ information
Our team has extensive experience in SSI prevention and control. We have
published several observational and interventional studies in high-impact
journals in this field [62-68]. The hypothesis to be tested in this RCT
originates from the results of our prospective observational study [62],
although others have published results that differ from ours.
