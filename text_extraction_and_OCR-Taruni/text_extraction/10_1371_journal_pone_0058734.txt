Abstract
Background & Aims: Primary sclerosing cholangitis predominantly affects males and is an important indication for liver
transplantation. The rs738409 variant (I148M) of the PNPLA3 gene is associated with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver
disease and we evaluated its impact on the disease course of PSC.
Methods: The I148M polymorphism was genotyped in 121 German PSC patients of a long-term prospective cohort and 347
Norwegian PSC patients.
Results: In the prospective German cohort, actuarial survival free of liver transplantation was significantly reduced for I148M
carriers (p = 0.011) compared to wildtype patients. This effect was restricted to patients with severe disease, as defined by
development of dominant stenosis (DS) requiring endoscopic intervention. DS patients showed markedly decreased survival
(p = 0.004) when carrying the I148M variant (I148M: mean 13.8 years; 95% confidence interval: 11.6–16.0 vs. wildtype: mean
18.6 years; 95% confidence interval: 16.3–20.9) while there was no impact on survival in patients without a DS (p = 0.87). In
line with previous observations of sex specific effects of the I148M polymorphism, the effect on survival was further
restricted to male patients (mean survival 11.9 years; 95% confidence interval: 10.0–14.0 in I148M carriers vs. 18.8 years; 95%
confidence interval: 16.2–21.5 in wildtype; p,0.001) while female patients were unaffected by the polymorphism (p = 0.65).
These sex specific findings were validated in the Norwegian cohort (p = 0.013).
Conclusions: In male PSC patients with severe disease with bile duct stenosis requiring intervention, the common I148M
variant of the PNPLA3 gene is a risk factor for reduced survival.

Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory
disorder that can progress to liver cirrhosis and liver failure [1,2].
PSC predominantly affects young males that are at high risk to
develop end stage liver disease and has a reported prevalence of up
to 16.2 per 100.000 with increasing incidence rates reported [3].
However, disease progression is highly variable [4,5] and can be
complicated by the formation of dominant stenosis (DS). The
formation of DS is associated with reduced transplant-free survival
[6]. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of PSC are still
unknown, increased prevalence among first-degree relatives
pointed towards a genetic component [7]. In addition, genome￾wide association studies have genetically linked PSC to human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex as well as non-HLA loci as
MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1 gene) and BCL2-like 11 protein
[8,9].
PNPLA3 is a member of the patatin-like phospholipase family
[10] and promotes cellular lipid synthesis by converting lysopho￾sphatidic acid into phosphatidic acid [11]. Its expression is
upregulated during feeding and consequently downregulated in
the fasted state [12]. The isoleucine to methionine switch at
position 148 results in higher lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase
activity. Therefore, the I148M variant causes a gain-of-function

effect leading to increased TG synthesis and deposition [11].
GWAS reported a strong association between increased hepatic
triglyceride content and the rs738409 variant (I148M) in the
PNPLA3 gene [13]. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients
with the I148M variant are susceptible to a more aggressive form
of the disease and are at greater risk of developing liver fibrosis
[14,15]. A negative correlation exists between the male proportion
in the studied populations and the effect of the I148M variant on
liver fat content, suggesting that a sexual dimorphism of the
I148M variant affects NAFLD development [14]. This observa￾tion was further sustained by the strong genetic association of the
I148M variant and NAFLD that was reported in women
#50 years old, but not in women .50 years [16]. The impact
of the I148M variant upon NAFLD seems to be best explained by
the additive genetic model as shown by a meta-analysis comparing
heterozygosity (GC) and wildtype genotype (CC). Evaluation of
the risk associated with heterozygosity for the I148M variant and
histological severity of NAFLD showed that the effect does not
differ when carrying only one G allele compared to the GG
genotype. In addition, carriers of only one G allele showed
significantly elevated ALT levels when compared with the
wildtype genotype (CC) [14].
In this study, we evaluated the impact of the I148M poly￾morphism on the course of PSC in a prospective study cohort and
in a second, independent cohort of Norwegian PSC patients.
Methods
Study design
The prospective study began on May 1, 1987, the outcome of all
patients in the study was followed up until September 2011. From
121 patients DNA samples were obtained after written consent, so
altogether 121 patients were included in this final evaluation of the
prospective study cohort (Table 1). The study was approved by the
ethics commitee of the University of Heidelberg. Informed consent
to participate in the study was obtained from each subject in
confirmation with the Ethics Commitee of the University of
Heidelberg. The study was carried out in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
As described previously [17], selection criteria for enrolling
patients with PSC in the prospective study included typical
endoscopic retrograde cholangiographic findings, serum alkaline
phosphatase activity of at least twice the normal range, negative
antimitochondrial antibody titers and a liver biopsy compatible
with the diagnosis of PSC. Exclusion criteria were decompensated
liver cirrhosis, if liver transplantation was foreseen or diagnosis of
cholangiocellular carcinoma occurred within three months after
presentation, patients with a history of neoplastic disease and/or
hepatic comorbidity.
At entry to the prospective study cohort, physical examination,
biochemical blood tests, and abdominal ultrasound was per￾formed, and repeated in yearly intervals. All patients were treated
with UDCA. The biliary system was evaluated using endoscopic
retrograde cholangiography (ERC) at entry of this study in all the
patients. In case DS were present, ERC was repeated yearly. If
there was no narrowing of the common duct at entry to this study,
ERC was performed every two years up to 1995. Since all the
patient with a DS showed increased liver enzymes, starting from
1995 repeat ERC in patients without DS was only performed
when alkaline phosphatase or gamma-glutamyltransferase in￾creased by 20% or greater. A DS was defined as a stenosis with
a diameter of less than 1.5 mm of the common duct or less than
1.0 mm of a hepatic duct (within 2 cm of the bifurcation). In
patients with total or subtotal stenosis of the major duct and
biochemical evidence of cholestasis, rigid dilation followed by
balloon dilatation of the stenosis was performed after a small
endoscopic sphincterotomy of the papilla. In patients with
dominant stenosis of the common bile duct, ERC was repeated
at yearly intervals.
Pathology reports of liver explants
Of the patients that had received liver transplantation during
the course of the ongoing study, histology was evaluated by two
board certified pathologists with special expertise in liver
pathology.
Norwegian study cohort
The second, Norwegian cohort consists of 347 PSC patients
with follow-up data available, all recruited at admission to Oslo
University Hospital Rikshospitalet, a tertiary care center. Median
age of diagnosis was 36.4 years, while the life-time prevalence of
inflammatory bowel disease and cholangocarcinoma were 80.4%
and 9.7%, respectively. Random healthy controls (n = 1068, 51%
male) were selected from the Norwegian Bone Marrow Donor
Registry. Information on death for each patient was provided due
register. Of the 347 PSC patients, 224 patients received ERC at
the tertiary care center (Table 1). All ERCs performed from 1999
on were analyzed in regard of interventions (dilatation/stenting).
These interventions were commonly performed due to a DS.
RT Quantitative PCR for PNPLA3 expression analysis
Patient tissues and mouse tissue samples were analyzed. Sample
preparation was performed in accordance with the local ethics
committee. Total RNA from tissues, as well as from the human
cell lines Caco, MZCHA1, and HepG2 were isolated using
RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized
from total RNA with oligo(dT) primers by using the Omnis￾criptcDNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Specific mRNA transcripts were
quantified using QuantiTect SYBR Green (Qiagen) and the
following QuantiTect primers (Qiagen) for murine PNPLA3
(QT00129710) and for human PNPLA3 (QT00055419). The
murine housekeeping gene Gapdh (QT01658692) and human
housekeeping gene Gapdh (QT01192646) were used as the
reference. Data acquisition and analysis of gene expression was
performed on the LightCycler software package (Light Cycler 480

software release 1.5.0, Roche Mannheim, Germany). Each PCR
reaction was run in triplicates. Target mRNA expression was
compared to the expression of the housekeeping gene.
Animal work
Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld,
Germany) were used at 10 weeks of age. Tissues were harvested
and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
280uC. All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Heidelberg.
PNPLA3 analysis
For analysis of the I148M PNPLA3 polymorphism (rs738409),
genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples applying
the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany;
#51183) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was
then analyzed using the PNPLA3 kit from TibMolBiol (Berlin,
Germany; #11241101) on a Light Cycler 2.0 (Light Cycler
software release 3.5.28, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly,
approximately 100 ng of genomic DNA were applied to real time
PCR with 95uC for 10 minutes and 45 cycles of temperatures 95,
60 and 72uC for 10, 10 and 15 seconds, respectively. The SNPs
were subsequently detected by melting curve analysis, monitoring
the fluorescence intensities of SNP-specific DNA probes starting at
35uC. Single signals at either 46 or 57uC revealed the homozygous
genotype ‘‘G’’ (‘‘C’’ on the resulting mRNA) or ‘‘C’’ (‘‘G’’ on the
resulting mRNA), respectively, while signals at both 46 and 57uC
were characteristic for heterozygous genotypes.
Genotyping in the Norwegian cohort was performed with both
the SequenomMassARRAYH iPLEXH Gold system [18] at the
Centre for Integrative Genetics (Norwegian University of Life
Sciences, A˚ s, Norway) and a TaqManTM SNP Genotyping Assay
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [19]. In overlapping
samples the concordance was 99.6% between these two methods.
Statistics
Continuous data were compared with the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, probability distributions by using Chi￾square test. The actuarial survival free of liver transplantation rate
was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Differences
between the actuarial estimates were analyzed using the log-rank
test.
Results
Prospective study cohort
In the prospective cohort of 121 patients 63.6% (n = 77) were
wildtype (CC), 33.1% (n = 40) heterozygous (GC) and 3.3% (n = 4)
homozygous for the mutation (GG, Table 2). These data were in
Hardy-Weinberg-equilibrium (X2= 0.19). Since the I148M vari￾ant of the PNPLA3 gene follows the additive genetic model,
patients carrying either one or two mutated allele were combined
for further analyses and compared to patients carrying two wild￾type alleles (I148M = GC/GG, WT = CC). Mayo risk score
showed no significant difference based on genotype (p = 0.610).
The main study endpoint was actuarial survival free of liver
transplantation, defining death and liver transplantation as events.
16.9% (n = 13/77) of the WT patients and 36.4% (n = 16/44) of
I148M carriers died or needed liver transplantation. Kaplan–
Meier analysis revealed that actuarial survival free of liver
transplantation was significantly reduced (p = 0.011) in the
presence of the I148M variant (mean 13.9 years; 95% confidence
interval: 11.8–16.0) compared to the WT patients (mean
19.3 years; 95% confidence interval: 17.3–21.4; Fig. S1).
Impact of I148M variant upon dominant bile duct
stenosis
There was a trend towards development of DS for I148M
patients (p = 0.167) without reaching statistical significance.
However, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a DS
showed significantly impaired actuarial survival free of liver
transplantation (p = 0.004) when carrying either one or two
mutated alleles (mean 9.6 years; 95% confidence interval: 7.7–
11.5) compared to WT patients (mean 16.2 years; 95% confidence
interval: 13.7–18.6; Fig. 1A). Interestingly, patients without a DS
were not affected by the I148M variant (mean 11.1 years; 95%
confidence interval: 9.2–13.0) compared to WT patients (mean
19.5 years; 95% confidence interval: 15.9–23.0) in regard of
actuarial survival free of liver transplantation (p = 0.87; Fig. 1B).
Since predominantly patients with a DS were affected by the
I148M polymorphism, we included patients with a DS for further
analysis of gender specific differences.
Sexual dimorphism of the I148M variant
Kaplan-Meier Analysis revealed a sex specific effect of the
I148M variant upon actuarial survival free of liver transplantation.
Male I148M patients with a DS showed significantly impaired
(p = 0.002; Fig. 2A) actuarial survival (mean 11.9 years; 95%
confidence interval: 10.0–13.9) compared to male WT patients
(mean 18.8 years; 95% confidence interval: 16.2–21.5). In
contrary, there was no impact of the I148M variant in female
patients (Female_I148M carriers: mean 20.3 years; 95% confi￾dence interval: 17.8–22.8 vs. Female_WT: mean 14.8 years; 95%
confidence interval: 11.9–17.7; Fig. 2B).
Norwegian study cohort
We screened for the I148M polymorphism in a second,
independent cohort of 347 Norwegian PSC patients. The overall
callrate in the Norwegian cohort was 99.5%. The allele
frequencies were similar between PSC patients and healthy
controls (Table 2). There were 62.0% (n = 215) wildtype patients,
32.6% (n = 113) were heterozygous and 5.5% (n = 19) homozygous
for the mutation (Table 2). The genotype frequencies were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 224 of the 347 PSC patients
received ERC at the tertiary care center in Norway. 123 of these
PSC patients received endoscopic intervention (dilatation/stent￾ing) due to stenosis of the biliary system.
In this second, independent cohort of PSC patients, we also
detected a gender specific impact of the I148M polymorphism on
actuarial survival free of liver transplantation. While Male_I148M
carriers showed significantly impaired actuarial survival (mean
7.8 years; 95% confidence interval: 4.9–10.6) compared to
Male_WT patients (mean 13.4 years; 95% confidence interval:
10.5–16.3; p = 0.013; Fig. 2C), actuarial survival in female PSC
patients did not differ when carrying the I148M variant (mean
15.1 years; 95% confidence interval: 10.4–19.8) compared to
wildtype patients (mean 13.4 years; 95% confidence interval: 6.9–
19.9; Fig. 2D).
Combined analysis of PSC patients of the prospective study
cohort and the Norwegian study cohort that had received
endoscopic intervention due to biliary stenosis (n = 204) demon￾strates the gender specific impact of the I148M variant on PSC
patients. Male_I148M patients show significantly impaired actu￾arial survival free of liver transplantation (p,0.001) compared to
Male_WT patients while the polymorphism does not affect female
PSC patients (Fig. 3A–B).

Expression analysis
Using RT-PCR we were able to show that the PNPLA3 gene is
expressed in the biliary system in humans, mice and in
cholangiocyte cell culture lines (Fig. S2A–B).
Discussion
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a cholestatic liver disease that
predominantly affects young males and is caused by chronic
inflammation of the bile ducts that can progress to liver cirrhosis,
liver failure or cholangiocarcinoma [1]. Its hallmark is the chronic
inflammation that can lead to the obstruction of the bile ducts.
Therapeutic approaches, including endoscopic dilatation and
treatment with ursodesoxycholic acid might delay disease pro￾gression, but the only potential cure is liver transplantation [1,3].
In addition, PSC patients are at risk for developing hepatobiliary
carcinoma with a cumulative lifetime incidence of 10–15% [20].
The etiology of PSC however remains unknown. As previously
reported in detail, there is an association between the PNPLA3
I148M variant with alcoholic or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [21].
The variant has also been associated with higher triglyceride levels
in hepatocytes, an effect that seems to follow a gender specific
pattern [14]. However, there is no information on a contribution
to cholestatic liver diseases.
The I148M variant represents a susceptibility factor for hepatic
fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases [21], but has only
been attributed to parenchymal liver disease. In the present study,
there was no evidence for marked steatosis in liver explants of
transplanted patients carrying the mutated allele. PNPLA3 is
known to be expressed in various human tissues, with highest
expression levels in the liver [22]. In line with the detection of
PNPLA3 gene expression in the biliary system of humans, mice and
in a human cholangiocyte cell culture line (Fig. S2A–B), we next
sought to assess whether the I148M variant affects disease course
of PSC patients. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical impact of the
I148M variant in a well-characterized prospective study cohort of
121 PSC patients with a maximum follow-up of up to 25 years and
in a second, independent Norwegian cohort of 347 PSC patients
with particular attention to gender specific differences.
Using Kaplan–Meier analysis, we demonstrated that in the
German prospective cohort carriers of the I148M PNPLA3 variant
show significantly reduced actuarial survival free of liver trans￾plantation (p = 0.011) compared to wildtype patients. The
hallmark of PSC is periductal fibrosis that can lead to the
formation of DS, a feature of disease progression and associated

with reduced survival resulting in priorisation of PSC patients with
DS on waiting list for liver transplantation. Since the presence of
a DS is associated with reduced transplant-free survival and has
been implemented in liver allocation [6], we evaluated whether
the impact of the I148M polymorphism on actuarial survival is
attributed to the formation of DS. Although we observed a trend
for development of dominant bile duct stenosis (p = 0.167) in
I148M patients, this did not reach statistical significance.
However, patients diagnosed with a DS showed markedly reduced
actuarial survival free of liver transplantation (p = 0.004) when
carrying the I148M variant (mean 9.6 years; 95% CI: 7.7–11.5;
Fig. 1B) from the time-point, when a DS was first diagnosed and
treated compared to wildtype patients (mean 16.2 years; 95% CI:
13.7–18.6). Interestingly, the I148M variant did not affect
actuarial survival in patients without a DS (p = 0.87; Fig. 1C)
suggesting that the I148M PNPLA3 variant particularly affects
PSC patients with severe bile duct strictures.
Since a sexual dimorphism of the I148M variant upon NAFLD
development has been reported [14] and the clinical finding of
PSC is predominant in males, we investigated gender specific
differences of the I148M polymorphism in PSC patients with a DS.
While actuarial survival of male PSC patients was significantly
reduced for carriers of the I148M variant (p = 0.002; Fig. 2A),
female patients were not affected by the I148M mutation
(p = 0.38; Fig. 2B). This goes in line with a recent Meta-analysis
evaluating the impact of the I148M variant upon NAFLD stating
a negative correlation between the male proportion in the studied
populations and the effect of the I148M variant on liver fat content
[14].
In order to reassess these gender specific findings, we screened
a second, independent cohort of 347 Norwegian PSC patients for
the I148M variant. In this cohort, 234 PSC patients received ERC
at the tertiary institute of which 123 PSC patients needed
endoscopic intervention due to bile duct stenosis. In congruence

to the findings of the prospective study cohort, male carriers of the
I148M variant showed significantly reduced actuarial survival free
of liver transplantation (p = 0.013; Fig. 2C) compared to male
wildtype patients. Again, the I148M polymorphism did not affect
female PSC patients with bile duct stenosis (p = 0.651; Fig. 2D).
By screening 469 PSC patients for the I148M PNPLA3 variant,
we were able to detect a gender specific impact of the I148M
polymorphism on PSC patients, particular in the presence of
dominant bile duct stenosis. These results sustain and affiliate
studies that previously reported a sexual dimorphism for both PSC
and the I148M variant of the PNPLA3 gene. Based on the findings
of our study, male carriers of the I148M variant show significantly
reduced actuarial survival free of liver transplantation in the
presence of a DS. These results were validated in a second,
independent cohort of PSC patient. Therefore, male carriers of the
I148M variant can be identified as a high risk PSC subgroup,
which is pivotal for proper risk stratification, surveillance strategies
and liver transplant allocation.
Up to now PNPLA3 function has been largely restricted to
hepatocytes and adipocytes. The presented data of the sex specific
impact of the PNPLA3 variant upon PSC patients might be the
basis for further studies. According to our results, genetic testing
for the common PNPLA3 variant could improve diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches in patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis, particular in the presence of a DS.

Figure S1 Kaplan – Meier estimate for PSC patients
regarding the I148M variant. The I148M variant is
associated with reduced actuarial survival free of liver trans￾plantation in PSC patients: Kaplan – Meier analysis estimate of all
patients in the prospective study cohort (n = 121). There were 16
events for I148M carriers and 13 events for WT patients showing
a significantly reduced actuarial survival free of liver trans￾plantation for carriers of the I148M polymorphism (p = 0.011).

Figure S2 PNPLA3 mRNA gene expression data. Figur￾e S2A: PNPLA3 mRNA is expressed in the biliary tissue of mice:
PNPLA3 mRNA expression in liver, gallbladder, spleen and heart
tissues of C57Bl/6 mice was obtained using RT-PCR. Data
represents means 6 SD (n = 3 per group). Figure S2B: PNPLA3
mRNA is expressed in human liver and biliary cell lines: PNPLA3
mRNA in HepG2 and MZCHA1 cell lines was obtained using
RT-PCR. Three experiments were performed. Assays were
performed in triplicates and are representative of three in￾dependent experiments. Values are the means 6 SD.
