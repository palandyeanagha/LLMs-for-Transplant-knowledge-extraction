Abstract
Introduction: Prone positioning (PP) has been reported to improve the survival of patients with severe acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is uncertain whether the beneficial effects of PP are associated
with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and long durations of PP. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to
evaluate whether the effects of PP on mortality could be affected by PEEP level and PP duration and to identify
which patients might benefit the most from PP.
Methods: Publications describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which investigators have compared prone
and supine ventilation were retrieved by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, the
Cochrane Library, the Web of Science and Elsevier Science (inception to May 2013). Two investigators
independently selected RCTs and assessed their quality. The data extracted from the RCTs were combined in a
cumulative meta-analysis and analyzed using methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Results: A total of nine RCTs with an aggregate of 2,242 patients were included. All of the studies received scores
of up to three points using the methods recommended by Jadad et al. One trial did not conceal allocation. This
meta-analysis revealed that, compared with supine positioning, PP decreased the 28- to 30-day mortality of ARDS
patients with a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤100 mmHg (n = 508, risk ratio
(RR) = 0.71, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.57 to 0.89; P = 0.003). PP was shown to reduce both 60-day mortality
(n = 518, RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68 to 0.99; P = 0.04) and 90-day mortality (n = 516, RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.75;
P < 0.0001) in ARDS patients ventilated with PEEP ≥10 cmH2O. Moreover, PP reduced 28- to 30-day mortality when
the PP duration was >12 h/day (n = 1,067, RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04).
Conclusions: PP reduced mortality among patients with severe ARDS and patients receiving relatively high PEEP
levels. Moreover, long-term PP improved the survival of ARDS patients.
Introduction
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common,
serious condition of critically ill patients and a major cause
of death in ICUs. Although numerous approaches have
been employed to improve the effects of ventilation [1-3],
including protective ventilator setting strategies and para￾lytic agents, the reported mortality rate of ARDS patients
continues to be as high as 40% [4]. The high resource
consumption associated with this severe disease results in
a heavy burden to society.
Prone positioning (PP) is a relatively simple method that
has been shown to improve gas exchange and oxygenation
in ARDS patients [5,6]. Several mechanisms [7-10] have
been suggested to explain these effects: (1) improvement in
regional ventilation, (2) redistribution of perfusion mainly
related to the horizontal axis, (3) greater homogeneity of
ventilation/perfusion ratios, (4) recruitment of perfused tis￾sue from dorsal regions that exceeds ventral derecruitment
and (5) increases in lung volume and alveolar recruitment
due to unloading of diaphragmatic movement in the prone
position. However, during the past few years, no significant

changes in the mortality rate of ARDS patients have been
observed, despite improvements in oxygenation [5,6].
More recently, researchers in several studies have
shown that PP can improve the survival of patients with
severe hypoxemic ARDS [11-13]. It has also been sug￾gested that long durations of PP should be applied in
ARDS patients with low lung recruitability [9,11,12]. In
addition, ventilator settings, particularly PEEP levels, may
have an impact on the effects of PP [14]. Therefore, in this
meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate whether the effects of
PP on mortality could be affected by PEEP levels and by
the PP duration, as well as which patients might benefit
the most from PP.
Methods
Data sources and search strategies
Reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PP in
ARDS patients were retrieved by searching the following
data sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library,
the Web of Science and Elsevier Science (inception to
May 2013). The following keywords were used: (“prone
position” OR “body posture” OR “body position” OR
“prone positioning”) AND (“acute respiratory distress
syndrome” OR “lung injury” OR “respiratory failure” OR
“ALI” OR “ARDS”). Adult and pediatric populations
were included in this literature search, and we restricted
the literature language to English.
Study selection
Two investigators assessed the retrieved studies, and they
included the titles, abstracts and citations independently for
possible consideration. The reviewers evaluated the studies
for inclusion based on the criteria presented below, and
they resolved any differences by consensus. The investiga￾tors selected the retrieved studies that fulfilled the inclu￾sion and exclusion criteria. Because this is a meta-analysis
of previously published studies, no ethical approval or
patient consent was required.
Inclusion criteria
Studies were included if the following criteria were present:
(1) the study was a trial comparing only the prone position
with the supine position in patients with acute respiratory
failure, acute lung injury or ARDS; (2) the definition of
ARDS or the diagnostic criteria for ARDS were similar; (3)
the study was a clinical RCT; (4) 28- to 30-day mortality
data were available or ICU mortality, 60-day mortality or
90-day mortality was presented; and (5) the numbers of
patients in the prone and supine positions were provided.
Exclusion criteria
Studies were excluded from the meta-analysis according
to the following exclusion criteria: (1) the article was an
editorial, review, letter or other type of publication not
based on original research; (2) the full text was unavail￾able; (3) the study did not include extractable outcomes
or mortality data; (4) the study was not an RCT; (5) the
trial did not use supine positioning (SP) as a control (for
example, the lateral position was used as a control); and 6)
the trial applied significantly different adjunct interven￾tions to the prone position and supine position groups
(for example, the supine position group received high￾frequency oscillatory ventilation, but the prone position
group did not).
Quality assessment
Two of the researchers (SLH and HLH) independently
evaluated the methodological quality of each trial using a
5-point scale described by Jadad et al. [15]. This instru￾ment was used to assess the following three aspects: (1)
the use of randomization, (2) the use of blinding and (3)
the handling of withdrawals and dropouts. The same two
researchers inspected the details of the randomization
methods by assessing the quality of the allocation conceal￾ment (adequate, uncertain, inadequate or not used) accor￾ding to the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration [16].
Data extraction
Our primary outcome was 28- to 30-day mortality. The
secondary outcomes were ICU mortality, 60-day mortality
and 90-day mortality. We abstracted the main informa￾tion, including the numbers of patients in the prone and
supine positions, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen/
fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) threshold ratio for pa￾tient enrollment, the application of PEEP, the PP duration
and the nonsurviving populations in the prone and supine
positions. Additional information was extracted, such as
age, sex, ICU length of stay, days on mechanical ventila￾tion (MV), number of consecutive days of PP, number of
cases of organ dysfunction, plateau pressure and tidal
volume (Vt). The two researchers (SLH and HLH) in￾dependently extracted all of the data. Disagreements
between the two investigators were resolved by discussion
and consensus, and a third party was involved in this
procedure when necessary.
Data analysis and statistical methods
The κ statistic was used to assess agreement between the
evaluators regarding trial selection and methodological
quality assessment. The meta-analysis of the effects of PP
on mortality in ARDS patients was conducted according
to methods recommended for use with the Cochrane Col￾laboration’s RevMan software, version 5.2.3 (The Nordic
Cochrane Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency were measured
and quantified using the Mantel–Haenszel (M-H) χ2 test
and the I
2 test of heterogeneity in RevMan. Obvious het￾erogeneity was predefined at P < 0.05 by Mantel–Haenszel

χ2 test or I
2 > 50%. In cases of significant heterogeneity
(P < 0.05 or I
2 > 50%), a random-effects model was used;
otherwise, a fixed-effects model was applied. We report
risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
the dichotomous data and weighted mean differences with
95% CIs for the continuous data. Publication bias was
evaluated by visual inspection of funnel plots. Because
only nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, a lin￾ear regression test of funnel plot asymmetry (Egger’s test)
[17] could not be performed.
Results
Search results
We identified 803 potentially relevant articles from among
442 listed in PubMed/Medline, 28 in the Cochrane Library,
276 in the Web of Science and 57 in Elsevier Science. We
retrieved 31 citations for detailed evaluation. Ultimately,
nine prospective RCTs, including one pediatric study [18],
fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the
cumulative meta-analysis. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of
the studies that were assessed and excluded at different
stages of the review.
Trial characteristics and methodological quality
The included studies were published from 2001 to 2013
and enrolled an aggregate of 2,242 patients, including
1,150 patients in the prone position and 1,092 in the
supine position. Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1
present the characteristics of all of the included patients.
Basic information about the P/F thresholds for enroll￾ment, PEEP levels, PP durations and Vt levels in each
included trial was examined. Moreover, we recorded
data on the primary outcomes (28- to 30-day mortality)
of patients with P/F ≤ 300 mmHg and the subgroups
of patients with P/F ≤ 100 mmHg and 100 mmHg < P/F ≤
200 mmHg. In addition, data on secondary outcomes,
including 60-day mortality, 90-day mortality and ICU
mortality in patients with P/F ≤ 300 mmHg, were assessed.
Other information is shown in Additional file 1: Table S1,
including age, sex, ICU length of stay, days on MV,
number of consecutive days of PP, number of cases of
organ dysfunction, plateau pressure and Vt. In addition,
we noted the number of ARDS patients with direct lung
injuries caused by pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary con￾tusion and other lung diseases, but not sepsis, shock,
coma or postoperative causes.
Various P/F thresholds were used for patient enroll￾ment, as Table 1 shows. In seven of the nine trials,
investigators enrolled patents with P/F ≤ 300 mmHg
[14,18-20,22,23]. In the trial by Guérin et al. [13], P/F
was limited to ≤150 mmHg. Mancebo et al. [21] screened
patents with P/F ≤ 200 mmHg, as did Taccone et al. [24].
Furthermore, the included trials applied different PEEP
levels and PP durations. The PEEP levels in the included
trials ranged from 7 to 13 cmH2O. The PEEP levels in
three studies—by Gattinoni et al. [19], Guérin et al. [14]
and Curley et al. [18]—were relatively low (<10 cmH2O)
compared with those assessed in the others. Similarly, the
PP duration varied from 7 to 24 h/day. In the studies by
Gattinoni et al. [19], Guerin et al. [14] and Voggenreiter
et al. [20], the patients were ventilated for markedly shorter
PP durations (7 to 11 h/day) compared with patients in the
other trials (17 to 24 h/day).
Additional file 2: Table S2 presents detailed information
about the quality assessment of the included studies, in￾cluding the Jadad score and the results of allocation con￾cealment. All of the studies received scores of three points
using the methods recommended by Jadad et al. Eight of
the nine trials concealed allocation, and the other [22] did
not. There were no obvious disagreements between the
two reviewers (κ = 0.25) during the trial selection process
or the methodological quality assessment.
Quantitative data synthesis
PP decreased mortality in severe ARDS, but not in mild to
moderate ARDS
As shown in Table 1, for ARDS patients with P/F ≤
300 mmHg, 28- to 30-day mortality rates were reported
in seven trials, 60-day and 90-day mortality rates were
reported in four trials and ICU mortality was reported
in three trials. The results of our meta-analysis show
that, among ARDS patients with P/F ≤ 300 mmHg, there
were no significant differences between the prone position
and supine position groups with regard to 28- to 30-day
mortality (n = 2,162, RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.07;
P = 0.18;) (Figure 2), 60-day mortality (n = 822, RR = 0.92,
95% CI = 0.81 to 1.05; P = 0.21) (see Additional file 3:
Figure S7), 90-day mortality (n = 1,600, RR = 0.85, 95%
CI = 0.62 to 1.18; P = 0.33) (see Additional file 4: Figure S8)
or ICU mortality (n = 785, RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.08; Figure 1 Flowchart of the meta-analysis.

P = 0.31) (see Additional file 5: Figure S9). The funnel plot
indicates the presence of publication bias following funnel
plot analysis (see Additional file 6: Figure S1, Additional
file 7: Figure S2 and Additional file 8: Figure S3), but we
found no obvious publication bias in the meta-analysis of
ICU mortality (see Additional file 9: Figure S4).
Moreover, subgroup meta-analyses were performed to
determine the effect of PP on specific groups of patients.
In four trials, the investigators reported 28- to 30-day
mortality rates of patients with P/F ≤ 100 mmHg, and
patients with P/F between 100 and 200 mmHg were
included in the subgroup meta-analysis. The subgroup
meta-analysis showed that PP decreased the 28- to 30-
day mortality of patients with P/F ≤ 100 mmHg (n = 508,
RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.89; P = 0.003) (Figure 2).
There was no significant difference between the prone
position and supine position groups regarding 28- to 30-
day mortality of patients with P/F ratios between 100
and 200 mmHg (n = 521, RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.39 to
1.34; P = 0.30) (Figure 2). Because of the unavailability of
data, it was impossible to perform analyses to assess
the effects of PP on 60-day, 90-day and ICU mortality
among ARDS patients with P/F ratios between 100 and
200 mmHg and among ARDS patients with P/F ≤
100 mmHg.
PP reduced 60-day and 90-day mortality in ARDS patients
ventilated with relatively high PEEP
We included in our meta-analysis seven trials in which
28- to 30-day mortality was reported, three trials in
which 60-day mortality was reported and four trials in
which 90-day mortality was reported (Table 1), with PEEP
thresholds as high as 10 cmH2O. Although we found
no significant difference in 28- to 30-day mortality (n = 966,
RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.04; P = 0.09) (Figure 3),

RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.75; P < 0.0001) (Figure 5)
between the prone position and supine position groups
with 10 cmH2O ≤ PEEP ≤ 13 cmH2O. We found no
significant differences in either 28- to 30-day mortality
(n = 1,196, RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.21; P = 0.61)
(Figure 3) or 90-day mortality (n = 1,094, RR = 1.04,
95% CI = 0.92 to 1.18; P = 0.56) (Figure 5) between
the prone position and supine position groups with
PEEP < 10 cmH2O. No obvious publication bias was
found (see Additional file 10: Figure S5), except for
the subgroup analysis of 90-day mortality related to
PEEP (see Additional file 11: Figure S6). Because of
insufficient data, we did not analyze the effects of PP on
ICU mortality of patients with 10 cmH2O ≤ PEEP ≤ 13
cmH2O or PEEP < 10 cmH2O.
PP reduced 28-day to 30-day mortality when PP duration
was longer than 12 hours/day
We included in the meta-analysis seven trials in which
the investigators reported 28- to 30-day mortality, which
we stratified according to PP duration, with a thresh￾old of 12 h/day. The funnel plots (see Additional file 6:
Figure S1) indicate a possible publication bias. No sig￾nificant differences were found in 28- to 30-day mortality
between the PP and SP groups when the PP duration
was ≤12 h/day (n = 1,095, RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.89 to
1.22; P = 0.60) (Figure 6). Among patients with PP dura￾tions >12 h/day, however, we found a significant decrease

to insufficient data.
Discussion
The first finding of our meta-analysis is that PP de￾creases 28- to 30-day mortality in severe ARDS patients
(defined as a baseline P/F ≤ 100 mmHg), but not in mod￾erate ARDS patients. These results confirm what was

the main benefit of PP is observed in patients with
P/F ≤ 100 mmHg. This phenomenon has been suggested
to be based primarily on the association between PP
and a decreased risk of lung injury due to stress and
strain forces [12,25]. Patients with severe ARDS are
at the greatest risk of lung injury from shear and
strain forces because of a low ratio of well-aerated lung
tissues to poorly aerated or nonaerated lung tissues
[12,26]. When a patient is placed in the prone position,
the lung has greater homogeneity and stress and strain
forces are decreased.
The second finding of our meta-analysis is that PP
reduced both 60- and 90-day mortality in the groups of
ARDS patients who were ventilated with relatively high
PEEP levels (10 cmH2O ≤ PEEP ≤ 13 cmH2O). There are
at least three possible explanations for this finding: (1)
high PEEP levels might be merely a marker of severity,
similar to the P/F ratio; (2) high PEEP levels might
increase the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury in
nonrecruitment conditions (increased hyperinflation);
and (3) PP and PEEP might exert additive or synergetic
protective effects. Cornejo et al. [27] reported that PP
enhanced the effects of high PEEP levels in terms of
lung recruitment and reductions in cyclic recruitment/
derecruitment, whereas it prevented the negative impact
of PEEP on tidal hyperinflation. Because ARDS is a
heterogeneous syndrome, these possibilities are not mutu￾ally exclusive.
The third finding of our meta-analysis is that PP
reduced 28- to 30-day mortality in ARDS patients with
relatively long PP durations (defined as PP duration >12
h/day). Researchers in several previous studies have
suggested that PP duration should be considered when
assessing the effects of PP, because alveolar recruitment
in the prone position is a time-dependent event [28].
However, the results of other previous clinical investiga￾tions have failed to confirm this finding [11]. The results
of our present meta-analysis show that the mortality rate
in the prone position group (129 (23.76%) of 543 patients)
was significantly lower than that in the supine pos￾ition group (208 (33.81%) of 565 patients), indicating
that PP duration also played an important role in the
survival advantage associated with PP. However, it is
unclear whether this finding is due to a dose response
to PP or whether a threshold daily PP duration is required
to obtain a benefit. Moreover, we have no evidence
indicating which patients benefited the most from
long-term PP.
Our meta-analysis has some limitations. It is likely that
we did not include all of the evidence, because we limited
our analysis to articles in the English-language literature.
Another limitation is associated with the data that we
obtained from the nine included trials. Some of the
trials reported the duration of PP only with medians
and interquartile ranges. We estimated the means and
variances based on the medians, ranges and sizes of
the trials using the formulas recommended by Hozo
et al. [29]. In addition, we used the mean overall dur￾ation of daily PP in each included trial in this trial￾level analysis. This might have resulted in ecological
bias [30]. The small sample size may also have been a
limitation, especially in the subgroup analyses with
few included patients. Moreover, the variability in the
selection criteria for RCTs and sample size, the in￾complete reporting of intervention intensity, the use
of low-Vt ventilation and the absence of volume–out￾come relationships in patients with ARDS may also
be limitations.
Conclusions
Similar to a previous meta-analysis [12], our present
study-level meta-analysis shows that PP significantly
reduced mortality in severe ARDS patients. However,
we found no demonstrated benefit of PP in patients
with mild to moderate ARDS. The new contribution
of our meta-analysis is the finding that PP decreased
mortality in ARDS patients who received relatively
high PEEP levels. Furthermore, we found that long￾term PP reduced mortality in ARDS patients, indicat￾ing that PP duration also plays an important role in
the survival advantage of PP. It is unclear if this import￾ance is a result of a dose response to PP or whether
there existed a threshold daily PP duration required
to obtain a benefit. The data we gathered suggest that
PP <12 h/day is less likely to be beneficial to ARDS
patients.
Key messages
 Patients with severe ARDS (defined as P/F
ratio ≤100 mmHg) clearly benefit from PP.
 There is no demonstrated benefit of PP in patients
with mild to moderate ARDS.
 Patients ventilated with a higher PEEP level
(defined as PEEP ≥10 cmH2O) also benefit
from PP. Because the results of this study
do not allow a definitive explanation for
these findings, no firm recommendations
can be made regarding the use of PP based
on PEEP level.
 In this study, we show that the PP duration
matters. It is unclear whether this importance
resulted from a dose response to PP or whether
there existed a threshold daily PP duration that
was required to obtain a benefit. The data
suggest, however, that PP for <12 h/day is less
likely to be beneficial to patients.
