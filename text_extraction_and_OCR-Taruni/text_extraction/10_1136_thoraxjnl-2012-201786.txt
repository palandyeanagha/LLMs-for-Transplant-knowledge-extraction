ABSTRACT
Background A polymorphism (rs35705950) 3 kb
upstream of MUC5B, the gene encoding Mucin 5
subtype B, has been shown to be associated with
familial and sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
We set out to verify whether this variant is also a risk
factor for fibrotic lung disease in other settings and to
confirm the published findings in a UK Caucasian IPF
population.
Methods Caucasian UK healthy controls (n=416) and
patients with IPF (n=110), sarcoidosis (n=180) and
systemic sclerosis (SSc) (n=440) were genotyped to test
for association. The SSc and sarcoidosis cohorts were
subdivided according to the presence or absence of
fibrotic lung disease. To assess correlation with disease
progression, time to decline in forced vital capacity and/
or lung carbon monoxide transfer factor was used in the
IPF and SSc groups, while a persistent decline at 4 years
since baseline was evaluated in patients with sarcoidosis.
Results A significant association of the MUC5B
promoter single nucleotide polymorphism with IPF
(p=2.04×10–17; OR 4.90, 95% CI 3.42 to 7.03) was
confirmed in this UK population. The MUC5B variant
was not a risk factor for lung fibrosis in patients with
SSc or sarcoidosis and did not predict more rapidly
progressive lung disease in any of the groups. Rather, a
trend for a longer time to decline in forced vital capacity
was observed in patients with IPF.
Conclusions We confirm the MUC5B variant
association with IPF. We did not observe an association
with lung fibrosis in the context of SSc or sarcoidosis,
potentially highlighting fundamental differences in
genetic susceptibility, although the limited subgroup
numbers do not allow a definitive exclusion of an
association.
INTRODUCTION
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
(rs35705950) located 3 kb upstream of the tran￾scriptional start site of MUC5B, the gene encoding
Mucin 5 subtype B, has been shown to be strongly
associated with both familial interstitial pneumo￾nia1 and sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) in US populations.1 2 MUC5B is a gel￾forming mucin and a major component of mucus
in the respiratory tract.3 The IPF-associated SNP is
located within a region highly conserved across ver￾tebrate species and, based on a prediction algo￾rithm, is potentially involved in gene regulation.4
By playing important roles in airway mucus rhe￾ology5 and mucosal immune defence,6 MUC5B is
essential in protecting the surface epithelium of the
airways. MUC5B overexpression was observed in
IPF lungs, with patchy staining of the epithelial
cells lining honeycomb cysts.1 Although the
mechanisms through which MUC5B dysregulation
plays a part in the development of IPF are currently
unknown, the strength of the genetic association

What is the key question?
▸ Is the MUC5B rs35705950 polymorphism,
recently reported as strongly associated with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a risk factor for
lung fibrosis in the context of systemic sclerosis
and sarcoidosis?
What is the bottom line?
▸ In our Caucasian UK based cohorts, we confirm
a significant association of the MUC5B variant
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. By contrast,
we found no significant association with lung
fibrosis in the context of systemic sclerosis or
sarcoidosis, although fibrotic subgroup
numbers may have resulted in insufficient
power to detect an association, especially if
less pronounced than in IPF.
Why read on?
▸ The lack of an association with lung fibrosis in
the context of systemic sclerosis and sarcoidosis
suggests that the MUC5B variant is associated
with an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-specific
pathway, differing from SSc- and
sarcoidosis-associated lung fibrosis which are
likely to have distinct genetic and pathogenetic
risk factors.

suggests a pathogenetic role of mucins and/or mucin-producing
cells which was hitherto unsuspected. However, whether the
MUC5B variant is a prognostic marker of IPF is currently
unknown.
Fibrotic lung disease occurs in a large proportion of patients
with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and, together with pulmonary
hypertension, represents the main cause of death in these
patients.7 In sarcoidosis the development of irreversible lung
fibrosis, seen in 10–20% of patients, is associated with poorer
quality of life, the need for long-term treatment and a worse
prognosis.8 A small number of genes associated with the devel￾opment of lung fibrosis in the context of SSc9 or of sarcoid￾osis10–12 have been reported, highlighting a genetic component
likely to involve several genes with small individual effects.
Although SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and
pulmonary sarcoidosis differ from IPF in many respects, includ￾ing better survival for equivalent disease severity,13 there are
many similarities in the fibrotic process and alveolar epithelium
abnormalities occur in all three diseases. In particular, the mem￾brane tethered mucin MUC1 (also known as KL-6), a member
of the mucin family expressed by type II alveolar epithelial cells,
has been suggested as a biomarker for disease activity in IPF,14
pulmonary sarcoidosis15 and SSc-ILD,16 17 although large pro￾spective studies are yet to be performed. We therefore investi￾gated whether the MUC5B polymorphism increased the risk of
lung fibrosis in the context of SSc and sarcoidosis and set out to
confirm the reported association with IPF. We also assessed
whether this polymorphism was associated with the severity of
lung fibrosis and the likelihood of disease progression in the
three fibrotic lung diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study populations
DNA samples were collected from consecutive newly presenting
patients with IPF (n=110) and sarcoidosis (n=180) attending
the respective clinics at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London,
and from patients with SSc (n=440) attending clinics at the
Royal Brompton and Royal Free Hospitals, London. The diag￾noses were made from well-defined criteria for IPF,18 19 sarcoid￾osis20 and SSc.21 The majority of patients with IPF received
combination immunosuppressive treatment and low-dose pred￾nisolone.22 None were included in trials with novel agents
which could have influenced functional decline. Patients with
SSc-ILD and sarcoidosis were treated with intended ‘best man￾agement’ with introduction/changes in immunosuppression dic￾tated by progression of disease and side effects. The control
population (n=416) comprised healthy blood donors mainly
collected from the south-east of the UK. Individuals were
judged as healthy based on a self-administered questionnaire
and by the routine laboratory investigations performed on
blood donors. Only Caucasian individuals of Northern
European descent were included.
As both the Royal Brompton Hospital and the Royal Free
Hospital Units are tertiary referral centres, patient cohorts are
likely to be a mixture of incident and prevalent cases. To indir￾ectly assess whether there could have been a selection bias
favouring prevalent cases in the MUC5B variant carriers in the
IPF cohort, we compared duration of dyspnoea at presentation
between carriers and non-carriers. Details on duration of dys￾pnoea were retrievable from the clinical notes of 98/110
patients with IPF. Duration of dyspnoea at first presentation to
the Royal Brompton Hospital was not significantly different
between MUC5B T allele carriers and non-carriers (32.1 months
in carriers vs 28.3 months in non-carriers, p=0.5
Mann–Whitney U test), suggesting there was not a significant
imbalance between prevalent/incident cases according to
MUC5B allele carriage.
Clinical assessment
Pulmonary function tests and high-resolution CT (HRCT) were
performed as previously reported.23 All investigations were per￾formed as part of a prospective routine clinical protocol.
Pulmonary function tests (expressed as percent predicted) from
the time of first presentation at the Royal Brompton Hospital
were available for patients with IPF (n=107), SSc-ILD (n=206)
and sarcoidosis (n=178). Among patients with SSc, ILD was
defined as a forced vital capacity (FVC) <75% and/or the pres￾ence of fibrosis on chest imaging (chest x-ray or HRCT).
Patients with SSc were also classified into autoantibody sub￾groups by previously described standard methods.24 25 The
patients with SSc for whom antibody status was known
(n=417) were grouped according to status for the two most
common antibodies found in the cohort, anti-DNA topoisomer￾ase 1 antibodies (ATA), which is known to be tightly linked to
the presence of ILD, and anti-centromere antibodies (ACA),
which is associated with limited skin disease and pulmonary
hypertension but protective for ILD.26
Quantification of disease severity and progression
in IPF and SSc-ILD
The composite physiological index (CPI), a functional index of
disease severity, was calculated as: CPI=91.0−(0.65×TLCO%
predicted)− (0.53×FVC% predicted)+(0.34×FEV1% pre￾dicted), where TLCO is lung carbon monoxide transfer factor,
and was used as a marker of lung disease severity in patients
with IPF and SSc-ILD.27
Time to decline was quantified using serial pulmonary func￾tional indices starting from first presentation to the Royal
Brompton Hospital. Significant functional deterioration was
defined as a decline (quantified as percentage change from base￾line) of ≥10% in FVC and/or ≥15% in TLCO, according to
established criteria.18 19 In IPF, a relentlessly progressive disease,
one subsequent time point from baseline was the minimum
requirement for follow-up, and time to first observed decline
was used. In SSc-ILD, to allow for possible response to treat￾ment or spontaneous fluctuations, at least two follow-up time
points from baseline were required. For SSc-ILD, time to irre￾versible decline was used, defined as time to the first significant
change in FVC and/or TLCO (as above) observed on at least two
consecutive occasions, as previously described.28 When
follow-up ended with functional decline on a single occasion,
this was accepted as a significant decline provided there was
symptomatic or radiological evidence of worsening. Data at a
sufficient number of time points were available to calculate time
to decline in 95 patients with IPF and 177 with SSc-ILD.
Quantification of disease severity and progression
in sarcoidosis
Based on the chest x-ray, staging of pulmonary disease was clas￾sified into stage 0 (normal chest x-ray), stage I (bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy (BHL)), stage II (BHL with pulmonary infil￾trates), stage III (pulmonary infiltrates without BHL) and stage
IV (pulmonary fibrosis), according to established criteria.20
Patients with sarcoidosis for whom lung function tests at presen￾tation and 4 years were available (n=140) were also categorised
into patients who showed a significant decline in lung function
at the 4-year time point and those who did not. In order for the
decline to be deemed clinically significant, it had to be

confirmed at the following clinic visit. A significant decline in
lung function was defined as a reduction in one or more of:
TLCO by ≥15%, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) by
≥10% or FVC by ≥10%.
Genotyping
Genotyping was carried out according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using a commercially available TaqMan assay and
TaqMan universal PCR master mix, no AmpErase UNG (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA) on a Rotor-Gene 6000
real-time PCR machine (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, California, USA).
Quality control and genotype determination were performed
using Rotor Gene 6000 Series Software 1.7 (Corbett Research,
Sydney, Australia).
Statistical analysis
To test for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE),
genotype frequencies were determined by direct counting and the
χ2 statistic or Fisher exact test used as appropriate. χ2 analyses for
association were carried out in Unphased V.3.129 and the non￾parametric Mann–Whitney test was used in GraphPad Prism V.4
to test for differences in median lung function measures accord￾ing to carriage of the minor T allele. p Values <0.05 were consid￾ered significant. The current study had 96% power to detect an
association with an OR of at least 3 in the IPF cohort, well below
the published OR for the association between the MUC5B SNP
and IPF in two separate populations.1 2 The study had 80%
power to detect an association with an OR of at least 2.0 with
SSc-ILD and of at least 2.6 with sarcoidosis with lung fibrosis.
The prognostic value of MUC5B genotype and allele carriage was
assessed in relation to disease progression. Based on the number
of patients, rate of decline in FVC and TLCO and length of
follow-up, we estimated that this study had a power of 80% to
detect a HR of at least 2 (or 0.5) according to MUC5B allele car￾riage in both the IPF and SSc-ILD cohorts. Proportional hazards
analysis was used to evaluate time to decline in FVC and/or time
to decline in TLCO, using the non-zero slope test developed by
Therneau and Grambsch as implemented in Stata (Computing
Resource Centre, Santa Monica, California, USA). In both IPF
and SSc-ILD univariate and multivariate Cox analysis, the slope
was not significantly different from zero, thereby indicating non￾violation of the proportional hazard assumption. Stepwise multi￾variate analysis was used to adjust for potential confounding
factors including age, gender, smoking status and disease severity
(CPI at first presentation), with retention of significant variables
in the final regression equations.
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical data of the IPF, SSc and sarcoidosis
cohorts are presented in table 1. Genotyping was successful for
all samples except for one control sample. This ungenotyped
sample is not included in the reported cohort size (n=416). The
genotype distribution in all of the analysed cohorts, including
all patient subgroups, conformed to HWE. The minor MUC5B
T allele previously associated with IPF1 2 was present at a signifi￾cantly higher frequency in the IPF patient cohort than in the
healthy controls (36% vs 10%, p=2.04×10−17, table 2). The
genotype p value was 9.11×10−17 (see online supplementary
table S1), and the OR for IPF in individuals heterozygous or
homozygous for the T allele were 6.62 (95% CI 4.10 to 10.67)
and 11.81 (95% CI 4.26 to 33.72), respectively.
By contrast, there was no significant difference in the MUC5B
allele or genotype frequencies between the healthy controls and
patients with SSc as a whole, or according to presence or
absence of ILD (table 2 and online supplementary table S1).
Similarly, no difference was found between the control cohort
and patients with sarcoidosis as a whole or according to the
presence of non-fibrotic (stages 0–III) or fibrotic (stage IV) pul￾monary involvement (table 2 and online supplementary
table S1).
Association with disease severity and rate of decline
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Median FVC% predicted, TLCO% predicted and CPI did not
differ according to carriage or non-carriage of the minor T allele
(table 3). With a median follow-up time of 13.7 months, 61 of
95 patients (64.2%) had a decline in FVC (median time to
decline 10.7 months) and 60 of 95 patients (63.3%) had a
decline in TLCO (median time to decline 10.8 months). No sig￾nificant difference in time to decline in FVC (HR 0.78, 95% CI
0.47 to 1.30, p=0.3) or TLCO (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.73,
p=0.9) was seen according to carriage of the disease-associated
T allele on univariate analysis (see online supplementary figures
S1A,B). However, after multivariate stepwise regression leaving
only significant covariates in the equation (CPI), the minor T
allele was associated with a longer time to decline in FVC, just
reaching the limits of statistical significance (HR 0.59, 95% CI

time to decline in TLCO (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.62,
p=0.9), even after adjustment for CPI.
Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease
Median FVC% predicted, TLCO% predicted and CPI did not
differ according to carriage or non-carriage of the minor T allele
(table 3). With a median follow-up time of 98.4 months, 104 of
177 patients (58.8%) had a decline in FVC (median time to
decline 35.1 months) and 124 of 177 patients (70.1%) had a
decline in TLCO (median time to decline 42 months). Time
to decline in FVC, TLCO or either measure did not correlate
with carriage of the T allele, both on univariate and multivariate
stepwise regression analysis, after adjustment for age, gender,
smoking status and CPI (adjusted HR for time to decline in
FVC 1.16, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.9, p=0.5; adjusted HR for time to
decline in TLCO 1.19, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.9, p=0.5) (see online
supplementary figures S2A and S2B). With regard to autoanti￾body status, no significant difference was observed in allele fre￾quencies between controls and patients with SSc according to
the presence of ATA or ACA antibodies (table 2).
Sarcoidosis
The MUC5B SNP was not significantly associated with severity
of lung function impairment at first presentation or at 2 and
4 years of follow-up (table 4). Furthermore, no significant asso￾ciation was observed with lung disease progression in sarcoid￾osis, with no significant difference seen between the frequency
in controls and patients who did (n=27, MAF=0.06, p=0.67)
or did not (n=113, MAF=0.11, p=0.28) show a substantial
decline in lung function at 4 years of follow-up.
DISCUSSION
We found no association between the MUC5B promoter region
polymorphism rs35705950 and the presence of lung fibrosis in
the context of scleroderma or sarcoidosis while we confirm, in a
UK Caucasian population, the association with sporadic IPF.
The lack of an association with lung fibrosis in the context of
SSc and sarcoidosis suggests that the MUC5B variant is not
related to shared fibrotic mechanisms across fibrotic lung dis￾eases but is instead associated with an IPF-specific pathway, dif￾fering from SSc- and sarcoidosis-associated lung fibrosis which
are more likely to be related to immunological/inflammatory
triggers.
In IPF, experimental evidence suggests that the respiratory
epithelial abnormalities have an important pathogenetic
role.30–33 Bronchiolisation of the distal lung epithelium with
aberrant expression of MUC5B has been observed in the lungs
of patients with IPF and may be related to abnormal differenti￾ation of the respiratory epithelium.33 Overexpression of
MUC5B is preferentially observed in honeycombed lesions;1
interestingly, honeycombing is present, if at all, only to a
minimal degree in the context of idiopathic or SSc-associated
fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). One might
therefore speculate that aberrant expression of MUC5B is
involved in the development of architectural distortion not seen
to a similar degree in SSc-ILD, mostly characterised by an NSIP
pattern.34 If this were the case, one could expect the MUC5B
polymorphism not to be associated with idiopathic fibrotic
NSIP, a hypothesis which will require a multicentre collaborative
approach in view of its relative rarity.
Limitations of this study include the relatively small numbers
in each disease group and the lack of a replication cohort for
the positive association observed in IPF. However, our IPF study
is in effect a replication cohort, as the association has previously
been described by two separate groups.1 2 Regarding SSc-ILD
and sarcoidosis, it is possible that we were unable to detect a
weaker association than the one seen in IPF due to insufficient
power. However, the lack of association with SSc-ILD is in
accordance with the recent publication by Peljto et al35 where
the cohort was approximately half the size of that used in this
study. Nevertheless, in view of the limitations in terms of power,
further studies using larger patient cohorts of non-IPF patients
are required to confirm the findings of this study.
Subgroup analyses of putative associations with disease pro￾gression within each disease cohort were hampered by relatively
small numbers, limiting the power to detect an association.
Nevertheless, following adjustment for disease severity, we
observed a trend bordering on statistical significance between
the MUC5B variant and slower decline in FVC in patients with
IPF. Interestingly, an association between the MUC5B variant
and less severe pathological changes was recently reported in
familial interstitial pneumonia.36 Although this observation will
require further evaluation in separate populations, it provides a
possible link between this polymorphism and disease behaviour
in IPF, suggesting the need for further exploration. In both the

SSc-ILD and in sarcoidosis groups the analysis was potentially
underpowered to pick up a more subtle effect on rate of
decline. Furthermore, it is not possible to exclude the fact that
the MUC5B variant could have an effect on the natural
untreated history of the disease as, in both groups, patients
observed to decline would have had immunosuppressive treat￾ment initiated or altered. As the choice of treatment, timing and
duration varied significantly during the years of follow-up, it is
not possible to correct for treatment effects in the analysis.
However, we can at least conclude that the MUC5B variant is
not associated with marked disease progression in a group of
unselected SSc-ILD and sarcoidosis patients receiving intended
‘best management’.
Seibold et al showed that, in the lungs of healthy individuals,
high mRNA expression levels of MUC5B were significantly asso￾ciated with carriage of the IPF-associated T allele. Interestingly,
although IPF lungs expressed 14.1 times higher levels of
MUC5B RNA than control lungs, there was no relationship seen
between MUC5B genotype and expression levels, in contrast to
control lungs.1 It is possible that, in IPF patients homozygous
for the G allele, MUC5B expression is upregulated as a result of
aberrant expression of an upstream/downstream factor. The role
played by MUC5B overexpression in the pathogenesis of IPF is
currently unknown, although a number of possible mechanisms
have been proposed.1 37 In order to better understand the
pathobiology of IPF, further work to investigate the effect of
excess MUC5B on injury response in the lung is needed.
Evaluation of MUC5B expression in lung tissue of patients with
SSc-ILD, fibrotic sarcoidosis and idiopathic NSIP would also be
informative. Overexpression could suggest involvement of
genetic variants upstream or downstream of MUC5B, or at least
the importance of this pathway across fibrotic lung diseases,
while the absence of MUC5B overexpression would highlight
MUC5B and related pathways as IPF-specific.
Despite the evidence that MUC5B expression correlates with
rs35705950,1 further work is required to establish a direct rela￾tionship between this SNP and regulation of expression. It could
be acting as a marker for another polymorphism with which it
is in linkage disequilibrium. Although Seibold et al demon￾strated that rs35705950 shows an independent effect on suscep￾tibility to IPF, it is possible that unscreened genetic variants,
particularly in unscreened repetitive regions which the authors
were unable to assess, may be in strong linkage disequilibrium
with rs35705950 and be the true disease-associated variant.
This is particularly true in the SSc and sarcoidosis cohorts, in
which MUC5B polymorphisms have not been previously
screened. A broader gene-focused rather than a single
SNP-focused study would be necessary to determine if other
MUC5B variants are involved in the pathogenesis of SSc-ILD or
sarcoidosis.
In conclusion, we confirm that the MUC5B polymorphism
rs35705950 is significantly associated with susceptibility to IPF
in this UK Caucasian population. However, in this population,
the MUC5B variant is not a risk factor for development of lung
fibrosis in SSc or sarcoidosis. We found that it is not a marker of
more rapidly progressive disease in any of the three groups and,
rather, there was a trend for a slower decline in FVC observed
in the patients with IPF which will require further investigation.
