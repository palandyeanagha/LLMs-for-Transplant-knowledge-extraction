Abstract
Post-heparin hepatic lipase activity is reduced in chronic re￾nal failure (CRF). This could be due to reduced synthesis,
decreased activity, and/or impaired secretion of the enzyme.
Further, the factor(s) responsible for such derangements are
not elucidated. We examined hepatic lipase metabolism in
normal, 6-wk-old CRF rats, CRF-PTX (parathyroidecto￾mized) rats, and CRF and normal rats treated with vera￾pamil (CRF-V, normal-V) using liver homogenate, hepatic
cell culture for 8 h, and in vitro liver perfusion. The Vmax of
hepatic lipase in liver homogenate was significantly (P ,
0.01) reduced and the Km was significantly (P , 0.01) in￾creased in CRF rats, but the values were normal in CRF￾PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V rats. Culture of hepatic cells
for 8 h was associated with an increase in hepatic lipase ac￾tivity but the increment in CRF rats was significantly (P ,
0.01) lower than that of normal, CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and
normal-V rats. Both parathyroid hormone (PTH)-(1–84)
and 1–34 inhibited the production of hepatic lipase in cul￾tured cells from normal, CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V
rats. The expression of the mRNA of the hepatic lipase was
significantly reduced in CRF animals with the ratio be￾tween it and that of house keeping gene G3DPH being
1563% compared to 4061.3% in normal, 4462.9% CRF￾PTX, 4465.4% in CRF-V, and 3963.9% in normal-V rats.
Infusion of heparin to the in vitro hepatic perfusion system
increased the activity of hepatic lipase in the effluent in all
groups of rat except in CRF animals. Infusion of PTH-(1–34)
in dose of 1026
 M into the liver perfusion system inhibited
the increase in post-heparin hepatic lipase activity. The
data show that in CRF (a) the mRNA of hepatic lipase is
downregulated, and hepatic lipase production, activity and
release are impaired, (b) that this is due to the state of sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF since both acute and
chronic excess of PTH were associated with these abnormal￾ities, (c) and that prevention of excess PTH by PTX of CRF
rats or blocking the effect of PTH by treatment with vera￾pamil corrected the derangement in hepatic lipase metabo￾lism. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:2167–2173.) Key words: para￾thyroid hormone • uremia • calcium channel blockers •

Introduction
Chronic renal failure (CRF)1
 is associated with hyperlipidemia
(1–5) due in major part to impaired removal of triglycerides
from plasma (3–5). Both lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase
are involved in the removal of triglyceride from plasma (6, 7).
We have found that hepatic lipase activity after injection of he￾parin is reduced in CRF (5). This defect was apparently due to
the rise in calcium content of the liver mediated by the state of
secondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF (5). An increase in
calcium content of the liver may reflect an elevation in cytoso￾lic calcium ([Ca21]i) of hepatocytes. Indeed, CRF is associated
with sustained elevation in [Ca21]i of many cells (8), including
hepatocytes (9), and the high [Ca21]i is a major factor underly￾ing cell dysfunction in CRF (8).
A decrease in the activity of hepatic lipase in CRF could be
due to a decrease in the production of the enzyme, an inhibi￾tion of the enzyme activity, an impairment in its release from
the liver, or to any combination of such potential derange￾ments. These possibilities have not been fully elucidated.
Recent data have demonstrated that the elevation in
[Ca21]i downregulates the mRNA of many proteins such as the
receptors of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-PTHrP, angiotensin
II, or vasopressin in hepatocytes (10) and of PTH-PTHrP in
kidney (10–12) and heart (13). It is theoretically possible that
the elevation in [Ca21]i of hepatocytes in CRF exerts a similar
effect on the mRNA of hepatic lipase. Such a potential action
could cause a decrease in the production of the enzyme.
The present study evaluated the effect of CRF on the
mRNA of hepatic lipase, on the production of the enzyme by
hepatocytes, the activity of the enzyme, and on its release by
the liver. We also explored the effect of the state of secondary
hyperparathyroidism of CRF on these parameters.
Methods
A total of 180 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 290 and
390 g (34062.8 g) were studied. They were fed normal rat laboratory
diet (Wayne Research Animal Diets, Chicago, IL) and allowed to
drink water ad libitum. The diet contained 1.4% calcium, 0.97%
phosphorus, and 4.4 IU of vitamin D per g. Studies were performed
in five groups of animals: (a) normal rats, (b) rats with CRF of 6-wk
duration, (c) normocalcemic parathyroidectomized CRF rats (CRF￾PTX) of 6-wk duration, (d) CRF rats of 6-wk duration treated with
verapamil (0.1 mg/g body wt), which was given subcutaneously twice
a d from day 1 of CRF (CRF-V), and (e) normal rats treated with ver￾apamil as described above for 6 wk (normal-V).
CRF was produced by a five-sixths nephrectomy; the animals un￾derwent two-thirds nephrectomy of the right kidney through a flank
incision, and 1 wk later, a left nephrectomy was done. PTX was per￾Address correspondence to Shaul G. Massry, M.D., Chief, Division

formed by electrocautery, and the success of the procedure was ascer￾tained by a decrease in plasma levels of calcium of at least 2 mg/dl.
This procedure does not produce significant damage to the thyroid
glands, which remain intact. The PTX rats were allowed to freely
drink water containing 5% calcium gluconate. This procedure is ade￾quate to normalize plasma calcium in the PTX rats. 7 d after PTX, the
rats were subjected to five-sixths nephrectomy as described above.
2 d before the animals were killed, they were housed in metabolic
cages, and two consecutive 24-h urine collections were obtained for
the measurement of creatinine clearance. Animals were killed by de￾capitation on day 42 after the completion of the five-sixths nephrec￾tomy in CRF rats (CRF, CRF-PTX, CRF-V) or after the beginning of
the treatment with verapamil in normal rats.
Hepatocytes were isolated using a modification of the method of
Seglen (14). The details of this procedure have been previously re￾ported from our laboratory (15). The cells displayed well-preserved
refringent shape with intact boundaries. There were no differences in
the appearance of the hepatocytes obtained from normal and CRF
animals as reported previously (9). Viability of the cells was . 90% as
assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test.
Hepatocytes (2.5 3 106
) from all groups of animals were sus￾pended in an incubation media containing in mM; 5.4 KCl, 0.44 KH2
PO4
, 0.98 MgCl2
, 0.8 MgSO4
, 137 NaCl, 1.33 Na2HPO4

and 20 Hepes, 2 mg/ml of DL-myo-inositol 1 monophosphate, 10 mg/
ml of BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5% vol/
vol heat-inactivated FCS, pH 7.4; the medium was supplemented with
amino acids and vitamins as described by Soler et al. (16). The cell
suspension was plated in a standard flat bottom, 96-well microplate
(Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Alexandria, VA) and incubated at 378C
under O2
/CO2
 (19:1) atmosphere in an incubator (Forma Scientific
Inc., Marietta, OH) with continuous shaking. Incubation was carried
out in the presence and absence of 5 U/ml of heparin (ICN Biomedi￾cals Inc., Irvine, CA), or various concentrations (1029
, 1028
, 1027
, and
1026
 M) of PTH-(1–84) or PTH-(1–34), 400 mM cAMP, or 100 mM
epinephrine as a positive control. After 8 h of incubation, the cell sus￾pension was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min with a refrigerated centri￾fuge (Model PR-7000M; International Equipment Company, Needham,
MA). The supernatant was removed and stored at 2708C. The pellet
was resuspended in 150 ml of the incubation medium and homoge￾nized by sonication with Braunsonic 1510 sonicator (B. Braun Instru￾ment, Melsungen, Germany) and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min
and the supernatant was removed and frozen.
The activity of hepatic lipase in both the supernatant and the hepa￾tocytes before and after 8 h of incubation was estimated in the pres￾ence of 1.5 mM of triolein, a concentration which provides for the
Vmax of the enzyme; the values are expressed as mmol/106
 cells per 8 h.
In another study, the whole liver from all groups of animals was
removed and weighed. They were then cut into small pieces and ho￾mogenized in 30 ml of a buffer containing in mM: 1.0 dithiothreitol,
1.0 EGTA, and 10 Hepes, and 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.4, with a Dounce￾type glass homogenizer (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) with a
clearance of 0.34 mm, 20 times. The homogenate was centrifuged at
1,000 g for 10 min with a refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was
removed for the determination of the hepatic lipase activity.
The assay of the hepatic lipase activity was done according to the
method reported by Ehnholm and Kuusi (7). We first prepared the
substrate for the assay as follows: radioactive tri (1-14C) oleylglycerol
(Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) was diluted in toluene to
provide 2 Ci/ml; 5 ml of this solution was added to 5 ml of nonradio￾active triolein (20 mg/ml) (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO.) in
conical tube, and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen gas. The
solution was then mixed three times with 3 ml of haptane (Sigma
Chemical Co.), and solvent was evaporated under nitrogen gas be￾tween washes. To prepare substrate emulsion, 7.5 ml of 5% arabic
gum solution was added to the tube. The microtip of the Braunsonic
sonicator–cell disrupter was placed 0.5 cm below the surface of the
mixture which was then sonicated in an ice bath for 4 min. After soni￾cation, 5 ml of 10% BSA solution was added, and the tube was agi￾tated with a vortex mixture. Adequate amount of the substrate
(0.125, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 1.500, and 3.00 mM of triolein) was added
to 250 ml of 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The buffer contained 2.0
M NaCl, 3% vol/vol FCS heated for 60 min at 508C. Also 50 ml of the
supernatant from the liver homogenate was added to the mixture.
The latter was incubated for 60 min at 378C in water bath with con￾stant shaking. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3.5 ml
of methanol/chloroform/haptane (145:125:100 vol/vol/vol). Oleate
was extracted by the addition of 1.0 ml of 0.1 M borate/carbonate
buffer, pH 10.5. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 g.
An aliquot of 1.0 ml of methanol fraction was aspirated and counted
for radioactivity. Hepatic lipase activity was calculated as 1 mU which
is equal to 1 mmol of oleate released/h per 1 g tissue.
In another set of experiments, liver perfusion studies were per￾formed in all groups of animals. The chest was opened, and the aorta
was cut and catheterized. Subsequently, the liver was perfused with
200 ml cold (48C) oxygenated, calcium free Joklik media (Sigma
Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10 mM Na Hepes, 10 mM glucose,
0.5% BSA, and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, over 2 min. At the end of this
procedure the liver was uniformly pale. Both superior and inferior
vena cava were ligated, and a PE 20 tube was placed in the superior
vena cava below the ligation. The liver was then removed and per￾fused through the vena cava catheter with warm (378C) oxygenated,
calcium Joklik medium at a rate of 15 ml/min. The effluent from the
portal vein was collected. The first 50 ml of the Joklik medium were
discarded. The perfusate then contained either 1026
 PTH-(1–34), he￾parin 5 U/ml, or both at variable sequences. The effluent was col￾lected every 2 min and kept for assay of hepatic lipase. To stabilize
the lipolytic activity, glycerol was added to the effluent to give a final
concentration of 20%.
Total RNA was isolated from the liver by acid guanidinium thio￾cyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction described by Chomczynski
and Sacchi (17) and later modified by them (18) using Trizol reagent.
The yields of total RNA (mg/g tissue) from the liver of the various
groups of animal were not significantly different (normal: 7.760.5;
CRF: 6.760.74; CRF-PTX: 7.460.25; CRF-V: 7.560.46, and normal-V:
7.660.81).
The poly A1 RNA of the liver was prepared from the total RNA
according to the method of Ansubel et al. (19) as previously reported
by us (10). The yield of poly A1 RNA from total RNA was
3.760.37% in normal rats, 3.660.25% in CRF animals, 2.860.48% in
CRF-PTX rats, 2.660.26% in CRF-V, and 2.860.42% in normal-V
rats. These values were not statistically different.
pRHLG2-2 plasmid containing 1,640-bp insert for rat hepatic li￾pase CD1A in EcoR1 site of pGEM-2 vector (20) was kindly supplied
by Dr. Michael C. Schotz of Veterans Administration Wadsworth
Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA. The plasmid was cloned into com￾petent DH5 a cells (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) in LB medium
containing ampicillin. The isolated plasmid DNA was digested with
the restriction endonuclease EcoRI, and the 1,640-bp fragment of the
cDNA of hepatic lipase was recovered by gel electrophoresis.
An aliquot containing 30 ng of the fragment of the cDNA of the
hepatic lipase was labelled with 5 ml of 32P dCTP (10 mCi/ml; Amer￾sham Corp.) using a Random Primed DNA Labelling Kit (Boeh￾ringer-Manneheim, Indianapolis, IN) and purified through G50
Sepharose (Sigma Chemical Co.).
Aliquot of 4 mg of poly A1 RNA of the liver were placed in sepa￾rate lanes of 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and subjected to elec￾trophoresis in 13 Mops buffer (20 mM Mops, 5 mM sodium acetate,
and 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) at 100 V for 3 h. The separated poly A1
RNAs were transferred to Hybond N1 nylon paper (Amersham
Corp.) with 203 SSC (1.5 M NaCl and 0.15 M sodium citrate, pH 7.5).
The poly A1 RNA was cross-linked to the membrane in a UV Strata
Linker 1800 (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA).
Prehybridization of the membrane was performed in 7% SDS,
1% polyethylene glycol, 23 SSPE (0.9 M NaCl, 40 mM NaOH, 50
mM NaH2PO4
 and 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 688C (21). Subse￾quently, the membrane was hybridized for 16 h at 688C with 10 ml of

Hepatic Lipase, Chronic Renal Failure, and Parathyroid Hormone 2169
prehybridization solution plus the 32P-labelled cDNA probes of the
hepatic lipase (sp act 1026
 cpm/ml). The membrane was washed twice
for 20 min each at 658C with 1% SDS, 50 mM NaCl, and 12 mM
EDTA. The membrane was then autoradiographed and analyzed by
densitometric scanning (LKB Ultrascan IX; Bromma, Sweden).
Northern blot analysis from the same poly A1 RNA were performed
using cDNA probe of G3PDH, (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo
Alto, CA). The amount of mRNA of the hepatic lipase in the liver
from animals with the various experimental conditions was normal￾ized by calculating the ratio between the mRNA of the receptor and
the G3PDH in the same tissue.
The measurement of calcium in plasma was made by Perkin
Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model 503; Perkin
Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) and those of plasma creatinine and phos￾phorus and urine creatinine by an autoanalyzer (Technicon Instrument
Corp., Tarrytown, NY). The serum levels of PTH were determined
by an ISN-PTH immunoassay kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San
Juan Capistrano, CA). This assay recognizes the amino-terminal frag￾ment of PTH. The lowest detectable level is 3 pg/ml; the intraassay
variation is 7.3%, and the interassay variation is 4%.
Bovine PTH-(1–84) (lot 10HO6661) and epinephrine were pur￾chased from Sigma Chemical Co., and bovine synthetic PTH-(1–34)
was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Bovine PTH-(1–84) was
dissolved in 0.15 N acetic acid and synthetic bovine PTH-(1-34) in wa￾ter and epinephrine was dissolved in DMSO and water.
Statistical analysis used paired or unpaired t test. Comparison be￾tween groups was assessed by ANOVA, and significance was deter￾mined with Bonferonni-Dunn test.
Results
Table I presents the body weights and the biochemical param￾eters of the five groups of animals studied. The body weight of
CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V rats were modestly but sig￾nificantly (P , 0.01) higher than those of normal or CRF ani￾mals. There were no significant differences in the concentrations
of plasma calcium among the various groups of animals, but the
concentrations of plasma phosphorus in CRF and CRF-V rats
were modestly but significantly (P , 0.01) higher than in nor￾mal, CRF-PTX, and CRF-V rats. The CRF, CRF-PTX, and
CRF-V animals had significantly (P , 0.01) higher levels of
plasma creatinine and significantly (P , 0.01) lower values of
creatinine clearance than in normal and normal-V rats. There
were no significant differences in these two parameters among
the three CRF groups of animals. The serum concentrations of
PTH in CRF and CRF-V rats were significantly (P , 0.01)
higher than those in normal, CRF-PTX, and normal-V animals.
Figs. 1 and 2 show that maximal velocity (Vmax) and
Michaelis constant (Km) of hepatic lipase of liver homogenate.
The Vmax of the enzyme in CRF animals (12165.8 mmol oleate/h
per g tissue) was significantly (P , 0.01) lower than in normal
rats (246610.8 mmol oleate/h per g tissue). PTX of CRF rats or
their treatment with verapamil prevented the impairment in

the Vmax of hepatic lipase with the values being 22166.7 mmol
oleate/h per g tissue and 22563.8 mmol oleate/h per g tissue,
respectively. Treatment of normal rats with verapamil did not
affect the Vmax of hepatic lipase with the value being 223612.2
mmol oleate/h per g tissue. CRF was also associated with a sig￾nificant (P , 0.01) increment in the Km of hepatic lipase
(410612 versus 270624 nM in normal rats). Again PTX of
CRF rats or their treatment with verapamil normalized the Km
of hepatic lipase (290626 and 310627 nM). Verapamil admin￾istration did not affect the Km of the enzyme with the value be￾ing 280618 nM.
Incubation of hepatocytes from normal rats for 8 h in the
presence or absence of heparin was associated with increased
activity (Vmax) of the hepatic lipase in the supernatant. When
the incubation was carried out in the absence of heparin and in
the presence of PTH-(1–34) or PTH-(1–84), the activity of the
enzyme was markedly (P , 0.01) reduced with 1027
 or 1026
PTH (Fig. 3). Similar changes occurred with 1029–1026
 M
PTH-(l–34). Similarly cAMP (400 mM) or 100 mM epinephrine
caused a significant reduction in hepatic lipase activity in the
supernatant as well as in hepatocytes (Fig. 3).
Table II depicts the data after the incubation of hepato￾cytes from normal, CRF, CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V
for 8 h in the presence and absence of 1026
 M PTH-(1–84) with
and without heparin. The hepatic lipase activity in both super￾natant and cells after 8 h of incubation was significantly (P ,
0.01) lower in hepatocytes from CRF animals than in the other
four groups of rats, and the presence of PTH failed to reduce
the activity of the enzyme in the CRF animals. In contrast, the
activity of the enzyme in the supernatant of the studies with
hepatocytes from CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V rats was
not different from that observed with normal hepatocytes, and
PTH-(1–84) did reduce the activity of hepatic lipase in these
three group of animals. Similar phenomenon was observed in
the hepatic lipase activity of the cells.
Fig. 4 depicts the results of the perfusion studies of liver
from normal rats. The perfusion of the livers with heparin (5
U/ml) produced gradual and significant increment in the activ￾ity of hepatic lipase in the effluent reaching a peak by 12 min
after the start of the heparin administration followed by a
rapid decline almost to baseline values. The immediate reper￾fusion of these livers with heparin and 1026
 M PTH-(1–34) was
not associated with an increase in hepatic lipase activity in the

effluent. In another set of experiments where the livers were
first perfused with heparin (5 U/ml) and 1026
 M PTH-(1–34),
there was no increase in the hepatic lipase activity in the efflu￾ent over the 18 min of such perfusion. The immediate reperfu￾sion of these livers with heparin (5 U/ml) alone produced a sig￾nificant increment in hepatic lipase activity reaching a peak

Fig. 5 depicts the results of the perfusion of the livers from
CRF, CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V with heparin alone.
The hepatic lipase activity in the effluent from livers of CRF
animals was markedly reduced as compared to that obtained
from livers of CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V rats. The val￾ues in the latter three groups were not different from values
noted in normal animals.
Fig. 6 depicts the expression of the mRNA of the hepatic li￾pase and G3PDH obtained from livers of the five group of ani￾mals studied. The ratio of the concentration of the mRNA of
hepatic lipase to that of G3PDH in CRF rats (15.063%) was
significantly lower than that of normal rats (4061.3%), CRF￾PTX animals (4362.9%), CRF-V rats (4465.4%), and normal-V
animals (4063.9%).
Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate that CRF is asso￾ciated with multiple disturbances in the metabolism of hepatic
lipase including downregulation of the mRNA of the enzyme
and impairment of hepatic lipase production, activity, and re￾lease. The data also show that these derangements are in ma￾jor part due to the state of secondary hyperparathyroidism of
CRF in that prior PTX of the CRF animals prevented these
abnormalities in the metabolism of this enzyme.

Chronic excess of PTH exerts its deleterious effect on cell
function and metabolism through the hormone-mediated rise
in the basal levels of [Ca21]i (8). The chronic elevation of PTH,
as in CRF, has been shown to cause a sustained elevation in
[Ca21]i of hepatocytes (9); it is therefore plausible to suggest
that such an increase in [Ca21]i is responsible for the derange￾ments in hepatic lipase metabolism. Support for this notion is
found in the observations obtained in CRF-V rats which have
normal [Ca21]i of hepatocytes (9) and normal hepatic lipase
metabolism despite CRF and elevated levels of PTH.
It has been previously shown that the elevation in [Ca21]i in
hepatocytes in CRF is associated with downregulation of their
mRNAs of the PTH-PTHrP, vasopressin (V1a), and angio￾tensin II (AT1) (10). The data of the present study provide an￾other example where the elevation in [Ca21]i is also associated
with downregulation in mRNA of another protein, i.e., hepatic
lipase. Indeed, the mRNA of the hepatic lipase in livers from
CRF-V rats which have normal [Ca21]i despite CRF and high
serum PTH levels (9) is not downregulated. The mechanisms
through which high [Ca21]i exerts this affect are not, as yet, de￾lineated. It could be due to impaired transcription or process￾ing of the mRNA and/or an increase in its turnover. The obser￾vations of Yang and Tashjian (22) provided evidence that a
rise in [Ca21]i adversely affected the rate of gene transcription
of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor in GH4C1
 cells.
Others have found that CRF is associated with increased deg￾radation of albumin mRNA in liver of CRF rats (23). Thus, ei￾ther one or both mechanisms may be at work to explain the re￾duction in the concentration of the mRNA of the hepatic
lipase activity in CRF.
The data obtained after 8 h of incubation of hepatocytes
showed that the activity of hepatic lipase in the hepatocytes of
CRF animals and in their incubation media was significantly
lower than that noted in the other four groups of animals. This
phenomenon is again due to excess PTH in CRF and its effect
on [Ca21]i of hepatocytes in that the activity of the enzyme af￾ter 8 h of incubation of cells from CRF-PTX and CRF-V and
of their media was not different from those obtained in hepa￾tocytes and their media from normal or normal-V animals.
Also, the exposure of hepatocytes from normal animals to
PTH for 8 h was associated with reduced activity of the en￾zyme in these cells and in their media, further supporting the
adverse effect of PTH on the activity of hepatic lipase. It is of
interest that PTH caused a reduction in the enzyme activity of
hepatocytes from CRF-PTX, CRF-V, and normal-V rats but
not those from CRF animals. This difference is most likely due
to downregulation of PTH-PTHrP receptors in the hepato￾cytes from CRF animals (10). The observation that treatment
of CRF animals with verapamil blocked the effect of PTH on
hepatic lipase but that the hormone did inhibit the activity of
the enzyme in the cultured hepatocytes obtained from CRF-V
animals seems contradictory. However, one must consider that
in the in vivo setting, verapamil is always present in the blood
of the CRF-V animals, while in the in vitro study verapamil
was not present in the culture media. Since hepatocytes from
CRF-V rats have normal [Ca21]i (9) and a normal amount of
mRNA of PTH-PTHrP receptor (10), it is reasonable to ex￾pect that the hormone may exert on their hepatocytes similar
effects to those observed on normal hepatocytes.
The decreased activity of hepatic lipase after the 8 h incu￾bation of hepatocytes from CRF rats could be due to de￾creased production of enzyme units and/or inhibition of the ac￾tivity of each unit. Our demonstration that the mRNA of
hepatic lipase in CRF is downregulated provide support for
the notion that the synthesis of hepatic lipase is reduced. How￾ever, a definite answer could be obtained by evaluating the
amount of hepatic lipase protein by Western blot analysis. This
has not been done in the present study. Other data in our study
showed that the kinetics of the hepatic lipase in CRF rats are
altered in that its Vmax is reduced and its Km is increased. It is,
therefore plausible to propose that both the production as well
as the activity of hepatic lipase are adversely affected in CRF.
Certain data support the proposition that an increase in
[Ca21]i of hepatocytes, induced by other agonists such as epi￾nephrine (24), vasopressin (15, 25), or calcium ionophore, re￾duces the activity of hepatic lipase (26, 27). Also, PTH (15),
epinephrine (24, 28), and vasopressin (29) increase the genera￾tion of cAMP by the liver, and cAMP inhibits the activity of
hepatic lipase as shown by others (3) and by the present study.
cAMP also raises [Ca21]i of hepatocytes (15). Thus, it is rea￾sonable to suggest that the inhibitory effect of PTH on hepatic
lipase activity is due to hormone-mediated rise in [Ca21]i and
increase in cAMP production.
Our studies of liver perfusion clearly demonstrated that the
heparin-induced hepatic lipase release is impaired in CRF, and
this derangement is again due to the state of chronic excess of
PTH in CRF. These in vitro studies are similar to those re￾ported in vivo in CRF rats where it was shown that the post￾heparin hepatic lipase activity in plasma is reduced in these an￾imals (6) but normal in CRF-PTX and CRF-V animals (5).
Further support for the effect of excess PTH on heparin-induced
hepatic lipase release is found in our observation that perfu￾sion of livers from normal animals with PTH inhibited this
process. It is of interest that heparin did not increase hepatic li￾pase activity in both the hepatocytes or their culture media
while it increased the activity of the enzyme in the effluent of
the liver perfusate. This finding could be interpreted that hep￾arin does not stimulate hepatic lipase production but causes
the release of the enzyme attached to the vascular elements of
the liver (31, 32). Others (30), however, reported that during
prolonged (24–72 h) culture of rat hepatocytes, heparin does
stimulate hepatic lipase production.
The impairment in the heparin-induced hepatic lipase re￾lease in CRF could be due to reduced availability of the enzyme,
if the production of enzyme is reduced and/or due to impair￾ment of the release process. The blocking of heparin-induced
hepatic lipase release by PTH by livers from normal animals is
consistent with an inhibitory effect of hormone on the release
process since the normal livers should have adequate availabil￾ity of the enzyme as demonstrated by the brisk hepatic-lipase
release induced by heparin alone. Taken together, the data are
consistent with the notion that the impaired hepatic release in
CRF is most likely due to both reduced availability of the en￾zyme and to interference with the release process.
The results of the present study shed light on the molecular
and cellular mechanisms responsible for the impaired hepatic
lipase activity in CRF. It is of interest that Mordasini et al. (33)
reported a selective deficiency of hepatic lipase in uremic pa￾tients; our observations provide an explanation for their finding.
Our data also provide insight into potential approaches for
the prevention of the derangements in the metabolism of he￾patic lipase. Indeed, both the prevention of secondary hyper￾parathyroidism of CRF or the use of calcium channel blocker
which interferes with the action of PTH on the liver may pre-

Hepatic Lipase, Chronic Renal Failure, and Parathyroid Hormone 2173
vent the derangement of hepatic lipase activity. These poten￾tial therapeutic approaches were found useful both in dogs (5)
and rats (6) in the amelioration of the hyperlipidemia of CRF;
indeed, we have found that the fasting hypertriglyceridemia of
CRF was prevented by PTX of dogs or rats with similar degree
and duration of CRF (5, 6) or by the treatment of CRF rats
with verapamil (6). Similar studies are needed in CRF patients
before the use of calcium channel blockers or the surgical or
medical treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are recom￾mended for the treatment of hyperlipidemia of CRF in humans.
