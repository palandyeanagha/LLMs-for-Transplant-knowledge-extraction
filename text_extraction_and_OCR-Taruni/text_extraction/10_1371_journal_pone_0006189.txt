Abstract
Background: The signaling pathways imposing hormonal control over adipocyte differentiation are poorly understood.
While insulin and Akt signaling have been found previously to be essential for adipogenesis, the relative importance of their
many downstream branches have not been defined. One direct substrate that is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation
is the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein, which associates with TSC1 and acts as a critical negative regulator of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). Loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex results in
constitutive mTORC1 signaling and, through mTORC1-dependent feedback mechanisms and loss of mTORC2 activity, leads
to a concomitant block of Akt signaling to its other downstream targets.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We find that, despite severe insulin resistance and the absence of Akt signaling, TSC2-
deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes display enhanced adipocyte differentiation that is
dependent on the elevated mTORC1 activity in these cells. Activation of mTORC1 causes a robust increase in the mRNA and
protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc), which is the master transcriptional
regulator of adipocyte differentiation. In examining the requirements for different Akt-mediated phosphorylation sites on
TSC2, we find that only TSC2 mutants lacking all five previously identified Akt sites fully block insulin-stimulated mTORC1
signaling in reconstituted Tsc2 null cells, and this mutant also inhibits adipogenesis. Finally, renal angiomyolipomas from
patients with tuberous sclerosis complex contain both adipose and smooth muscle-like components with activated
mTORC1 signaling and elevated PPARc expression.
Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that activation of mTORC1 signaling is a critical step in adipocyte
differentiation and identifies TSC2 as a primary target of Akt driving this process. Therefore, the TSC1-TSC2 complex
regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, at least in part, through its control of mTORC1 activity and PPARc
expression.

Introduction
The ser/thr kinase Akt (or protein kinase B/PKB) plays an
essential role in adipocyte differentiation. Mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Akt1 (PKBa) display an inability to
differentiate into adipocytes [1–3], and an RNAi-mediated
decrease in Akt1 was found to block the differentiation of 3T3-
L1 cells [4], a well-established preadipocyte cell line. Furthermore,
constitutively active Akt can promote the differentiation of 3T3-L1
cells into adipocytes, even in the absence of other inputs [5]. While
it is clear from these studies that Akt is both necessary and
sufficient to drive adipogenesis, its downstream targets involved in
regulating this differentiation program are not well understood.
Akt phosphorylates and regulates a large number of substrates
involved in a diverse array of biological processes [6], many of
which could contribute to the role of Akt in driving adipocyte
differentiation. Ultimately, the differentiation defect in MEFs and
3T3-L1 preadipocytes lacking Akt1 stems from an inability to
induce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc)
expression at the initiation of the adipogenesis program [1,2,4].
The PPARc transcription factor is the master regulator of
adipocyte differentiation, and like Akt1, its activation is both
necessary and sufficient for differentiation [7]. Supporting an
essential role for PPARc induction downstream of Akt1, forced
expression of PPARc in Akt-deficient MEFs was found to rescue
their severe adipogenesis defect [1].
At least two downstream branches of Akt signaling have been
implicated in the regulation of PPARc expression and adipocyte
differentiation. The forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcrip￾tion factors are phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt. Amongst
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6189

FOXO family members, FOXO1 expression is highest in adipose
tissue, but FOXO1 appears to be a strong inhibitor of adipocyte
differentiation [8]. An active mutant of FOXO1 that cannot be
phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt was found to block the
differentiation of preadipocytes, and this correlated with a loss of
PPARc induction [8]. Furthermore, FOXO1 has been proposed
to directly repress PPARc transcription [9]. Taken together, these
studies suggest that Akt-mediated inhibition of FOXO1 is one
mechanism by which Akt induces PPARc and subsequent
adipocyte differentiation.
Another major signaling branch downstream of Akt results in
activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a
critical regulator of mRNA translation and cell growth [10].
Primarily through use of the mTOR-specific inhibitor rapamycin,
several studies have concluded that mTOR activity is required for
proper differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines and primary
cultures [11–16]. The effects of rapamycin were found to correlate
with a reduction in PPARc mRNA and protein levels [12–15].
Transcriptional reporter assays in HEK293 cells suggested that
rapamycin might also inhibit insulin-stimulated PPARc activity
[15]. Interestingly, mouse knockouts affecting specific mTORC1
targets suggest that both S6K1 activation and 4E-BP1/2 inhibition
might contribute to a pro-adipogenic role for mTORC1 activation
[17,18].
The signaling relationship between Akt and mTOR is quite
complex [19,20]. Akt activity results in downstream activation of
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which is acutely sensitive to
rapamycin. Akt has been proposed to activate mTORC1 through
multiple mechanisms. The first is through direct multi-site
phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2 [21,22]. TSC2, when
complexed with its binding partner TSC1, acts as a GTPase
activating protein (GAP) for the Ras-related small G protein Rheb,
which is a potent activator of mTORC1 [23–28]. Therefore, Akt￾mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 relieves its ability to act as a
GAP for Rheb within cells, allowing Rheb-GTP to accumulate
and activate mTORC1. A parallel mechanism appears to be
through phosphorylation of the Akt substrate PRAS40 [29].
PRAS40 has been found by several groups to associate with
mTORC1, either as a regulatory component or downstream
substrate [30–36]. Two studies have demonstrated that the
previously characterized Akt phosphorylation site on PRAS40 is
involved in mTORC1 activation by Akt [30,31]. Finally, a more
indirect and less acute effect of Akt activation on mTORC1 has
been proposed to be through the effects of Akt on glucose uptake,
intracellular energy levels, and AMPK activity [37]. Importantly,
while mTORC1 is clearly downstream of Akt, its activation can
lead to feedback inhibition of insulin signaling to Akt through
effects on the insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (reviewed in
ref. [38]). Therefore, as originally characterized in 3T3-L1 cells
[39–43], short-term rapamycin treatment can increase Akt
activation in response to insulin in adipocytes and many other
cell types.
A second mTOR-containing protein complex, mTORC2, lies
upstream of Akt and contributes to Akt activation by insulin and
growth factors by phosphorylating S473 in its hydrophobic
regulatory motif [44]. mTORC2 is resistant to the acute effects
of rapamycin, but prolonged treatment with rapamycin disrupts
mTORC2 and in some lines results in loss of Akt phosphorylation
[45]. To this end, prolonged rapamycin treatment has been found
to block Akt signaling in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes [12],
suggesting that some of the previous findings regarding the effects
of rapamycin treatment on adipocyte differentiation could be
through loss of mTORC2-mediated Akt activation, rather than
inhibition of mTORC1. However, a recent study using siRNAs to
the mTORC1-specific component Raptor have supported a role
for mTORC1 in adipogenesis [46].
TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressor genes that are mutated in
the autosomal dominant tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC), which is characterized by widespread benign
tumors and a high incidence of epilepsy, autism spectrum
disorders, and cognitive deficits (reviewed in ref. [47]). TSC2
mutations are also the underlying cause of lymphangioleiomyo￾matosis (LAM [48]), a proliferative disorder that almost exclusively
affects women and results in cystic destruction of the lungs. Due to
loss of function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex and its GAP activity
toward Rheb, lesions from TSC and LAM patients display
constitutively elevated mTORC1 signaling. Interestingly, renal
angiomyolipomas (AMLs), which are unusual highly vascular
tumors comprised of both aberrant smooth muscle cells and
adipocytes, are amongst the most common clinical manifestation
of the TSC and LAM diseases. Within AMLs, both the smooth
muscle and adipose components display loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) at the TSC2 locus [49], demonstrating that both cell types
are constituents of the tumor rather than stromal derivatives. This
pathological observation might be linked to a role for mTORC1 in
driving mesenchymal cell differentiation.
In this study, we take advantage of the signaling changes in cell
lines lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex to determine whether
mTORC1 signaling downstream of Akt plays an important role in
adipogenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that MEFs
derived from Tsc1 or Tsc2 knockout embryos display constitutive
activation of mTORC1 [50,51], strong mTORC1-dependent
feedback inhibition of insulin signaling to Akt [50,52–54], and loss
of mTORC2 activity [55]. Therefore, disruption of the TSC1-
TSC2 complex results in Akt-independent activation of mTORC1
with concomitant loss of Akt signaling to its other downstream
targets, including the FOXO proteins [54,56,57]. We find that,
despite complete loss of Akt signaling, Tsc12/2 and Tsc22/2
MEFs display enhanced adipogenic potential, yielding insulin
resistant adipocytes containing increased levels of triglycerides. A
similar effect is seen in 3T3-L1 cells following stable shRNA￾mediated knockdown of Tsc2. Importantly, PPARc mRNA and
protein levels are increased in an mTORC1-dependent manner in
adipocytes derived from Tsc2-deficient MEFs and 3T3-L1 cells.
We find that reconstituting Tsc22/2 MEFs with a mutant of TSC2
lacking all Akt phosphorylation sites blocks insulin-stimulated
mTORC1 signaling and greatly reduces adipogenesis. Finally, we
find that both the aberrant smooth muscle and adipose
components of AMLs from TSC patients exhibit mTORC1
activation and elevated PPARc expression.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and constructs
Undifferentiated MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Immortalized littermate-derived pairs of wild-type and null Tsc1
(3T3 immortalized) and Tsc2 (p532/2) MEFs were provided by
D.J. Kwiatkowski (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA)
and were described previously [51,52]. Phosphorylation site (Ser/
Thr to Ala) mutants of human TSC2 were generated using
QuickChange Multisite-directed Mutagenesis (Stratagene), se￾quence verified, and subcloned into a previously described
retroviral vector (IRES-Hygro, gift of D.J. Kwiatkowski) upstream
of an internal ribosome entry sequence followed by the
hygromycin-resistance selectable marker [55]. Stable isogenic
pools of Tsc22/2 MEFs expressing the various constructs were
generated by infection with retroviruses encoding empty vector,

wild-type TSC2, or the TSC2 phosphorylation-site mutants,
followed by selection with hygromycin (100 mg/ml). 3T3-L1
preadipocytes were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and maintained in DMEM with 10% calf serum prior
to differentiation.
Stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of Tsc2 expression in 3T3-
L1 preadipocytes was achieved using retroviral contructs. shRNA
constructs targeting firefly luciferase or murine Tsc2
(V2MM_5415) were obtained from Open Biosystems, and the
shRNAs were subcloned into the mir30-based pMSCV-PM
retroviral vector provided by the laboratory of S.J. Elledge
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Retroviruses encoding
these shRNAs were produced in HEK-293T cells and were used to
infect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Stable shRNA-expressing pools of
3T3-L1 cells were selected with puromycin (2 mg/ml) and were
used immediately for the differentiation experiments described.
See Text S1 for supplemental materials and methods.
Adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride measurements
Previously established protocols for MEF [58] and 3T3-L1 [59]
adipocyte differentiation were followed and are described in brief
below. For induction of MEF differentiation, at 2 days post
confluence (day 0), cells were exposed to a pro-differentiation
regimen of insulin (830 nM), dexamethasone (1 mM), 3-isobutyl-1-
methylxanthine (IBMX, 0.5 mM), and troglitazone (5 mM). After
48 hours, cells were switched to maintenance DMEM medium
containing 10% FBS and 830-nM insulin for the remaining
duration of differentiation. Adipocyte differentiation parameters
were measured at 7–8 days following the initiation of differenti￾ation. For induction of 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, preadipocytes
were grown to 2 days post-confluence and the medium was
changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin
(1.7 mM), dexamethasone (1 mM), and IBMX (0.5 mM). After
48 h, the medium was replaced with maintenance medium
containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The mainte￾nance medium was changed every 48 h until the cells were utilized
for experimentation (9 days from the initiation of differentiation).
Oil Red O staining and measurement of intracellular
triglyceride levels were performed as described by others [60].
For quantification, cells were washed extensively with water to
remove unbound dye, and 1-ml isopropanol was added to the
stained 6-well culture plate. After 5 min, the absorbance at
510 nm of the Oil Red O extract and serially diluted Oil Red O
standards were assayed by spectrophotometer. Triglyceride levels
were normalized to protein concentration.
mRNA expression analysis
For gene expression analyses, RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), cDNAs were generated using the
Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit
(Invitrogen), and SYBR green-based quantitative RT-PCR was
performed using an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR
System. Samples were run in triplicate for each experiment and
were normalized to either b-actin or m36b4 expression to
determine relative expression levels. Primer sets used in this study
are provided in supplemental Table S1.
Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry
Protein extracts/cell lysates and immunoblots were prepared as
described previously [22]. All lysates were normalized for total
protein concentration prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.
With the exception of the b-actin antibody (Sigma), all antibodies
used for immunoblotting were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal AML tissue from TSC
patients, and normal human adipose tissue, were obtained from
the Pathology Department of Massachusetts General Hospital.
This study was approved by the Hospital Human Study
Committees. Serial 5-mm tissue sections were cut from each tissue
block for immunohistochemical analyses using the avidin-biotin
complex (ABC) method. Briefly, slides were deparaffinized and
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3%
H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. For antigen retrieval,
sections were heated in a pressure cooker in 10-mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) prior to staining. Antibodies to phospho-S6 (Ser235/236;
Cell Signaling Technology #2211; 1:200 dilution) and PPARc
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology #7196; 1:100 dilution) diluted in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were applied and incubated
overnight at 4uC. Negative controls included adjacent sections
incubated in PBS without primary antibody. Immunodetection
was performed with an LSAB 2 system (DAKO). Hematoxylin was
used as a counterstain, and an adjacent section was stained with
hematoxylin and eosin.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as the mean6SEM. Quantitative data for
intracellular triglyceride levels were analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance or paired 2-tailed Student t test using GraphPad InStat
version 2.04a. Multiple comparisons were performed using
Tukey’s honestly significant difference procedure.
Results
MEFs lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex display enhanced
mTORC1-dependent adipogenesis
To determine if mTORC1 activation downstream of Akt is both
necessary and sufficient to drive adipocyte differentiation, we
utilized littermate pairs of wild-type and either Tsc12/2 or Tsc22/2
MEFs. Akt and mTORC1 signaling in these MEFs have been
characterized in previous studies [50–57]. These MEFs display
growth factor and Akt-independent activation of mTORC1
signaling, as indicated by phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6
protein, and complete loss of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphory￾lation (Figure S1, panels A and B). The defect in Akt activation
and signaling to its downstream substrates is also evident in
TSC2-deficient MEFs grown in full serum, as illustrated by a loss
of FOXO1 phosphorylation on T24, and constitutive localization
of a FOXO3a-GFP fusion protein to the nucleus in Tsc22/2 cells,
similar to a mutant lacking the three Akt phosphorylation sites
(FOXO3a-AAA, Figure S1, panels C and D). Therefore, these
cells offer a unique setting in which mTORC1 activation can be
completely separated from the many other downstream branches
of Akt signaling.
These MEF pairs were subjected to conditions previously
established to promote differentiation of MEFs into adipocytes
[58]. Importantly, even in response to the very high insulin levels
utilized in this differentiation protocol (830 nM), Akt activation is
defective in both Tsc12/2 and Tsc22/2 MEFs (Figure S1, panels A
and B). Interestingly, despite severe insulin resistance, both
knockout cell lines underwent morphological changes consistent
with adipocyte differentiation and showed a greatly enhanced
capacity to generate lipid droplets, as indicated by oil red O
staining (Figure 1A and Figure S2A) and intracellular triglyceride
levels (Figure 1B and Figure S2B), relative to their wild-type
counterparts. To determine whether the increase in lipid
accumulation in the Tsc2-deficient cells reflects an increase in
adipogenesis, at day 7 of differentiation we measured the
expression of adipocyte markers, including the adipogenic

transcription factors C/EBPa and PPARc and the adipocyte￾specfic cytokines leptin and adiponectin. While transcript levels for
all of these markers were induced in both Tsc2+/+ and Tsc22/2
MEFs over the course of differentiation, their levels were
significantly higher in the Tsc22/2 cells (Figure 1C). Therefore,
cells lacking a functional TSC1-TSC2 complex display an
enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes.
Given the previous studies demonstrating that rapamycin could
block adipocyte differentiation [11–16], we hypothesized that the
enhanced adipogenesis phenotype of Tsc22/2 MEFs would be
dependent on the elevated mTORC1 activity in these cells.
Indeed, Tsc22/2 MEFs failed to differentiate in the presence of
rapamycin, exhibiting a loss of oil red O-staining (Figure 1D) and a
dramatic decrease in intracellular triglycerides (Figure 1E). This
effect of rapamycin is also seen in differentiating Tsc12/2 MEFs
(Figure S2B). As Akt and mTORC2 activity are already inhibited
in cells lacking the TSC1-TSC2 complex [55], these findings
demonstrate that the effects of rapamycin on adipocyte differen￾tiation are specific to mTORC1.
TSC2-deficient MEFs differentiate in an insulin￾independent manner and give rise to insulin resistant
adipocytes
Insulin signaling through IRS-1 and IRS-2 has been shown to
be an essential element of the adipocyte differentiation program
[61]. Given the down-regulation of these proteins in cells lacking
the TSC1-TSC2 complex [53,54,62], we hypothesized that
constitutive mTORC1 activation would allow these cells to
differentiate independent of insulin signaling. Interestingly, even
in the complete absence of differentiation medium, Tsc22/2 MEFs
incubated at confluence for 7 days in normal growth medium
accumulated more lipid than differentiated Tsc2+/+ cells (Figure 2,
panels A and B). However, the full adipocyte differentiation
medium induced a much more robust adipogenesis in these cells.
Consistent with the insulin-resistant nature of Akt signaling in the
Tsc22/2 MEFs, removal of insulin from the differentiation
mixture only mildly reduced intracellular triglyceride levels
(Figure 2B). These data suggest that a primary role of insulin
and IRS protein function in adipogenesis is to stimulate the
downstream activation mTORC1.
Due to increased expression of the insulin receptor (InR) and
IRS proteins, the responsiveness to insulin generally increases
upon adipocyte differentiation [63,64]. Therefore, we examined
the response of Tsc2+/+ and Tsc22/2 adipocytes to overnight full
serum or acute insulin. As in undifferentiated MEFs (Figure S1),
Akt phosphorylation is unresponsive to both serum and insulin in
Tsc2-deficient adipocytes, even at the high dose of insulin found in
the differentiation mixture, and these cells contain very low IRS-1
protein levels (Figure 2C). While the transcripts for Inr, Irs-1, and
Irs-2 are all induced in Tsc2+/+ and Tsc22/2 cells during
differentiation, their relative expression levels, especially for Irs-1
and Irs-2, were significantly lower in the Tsc22/2 adipocytes
(Figure 2D). Consistent with previous studies demonstrating that
chronic mTORC1 activation decreases both the expression and
stability of IRS-1 and IRS-2 [53,54,62], we find that 24 h
treatment with rapamycin increases Irs-1 and Irs-2 transcript levels
and IRS-1 protein levels in Tsc22/2 adipocytes, albeit to levels still
significantly lower than Tsc2+/+ adipocytes (Figure S3, panels A
and B).
GLUT-4 is a glucose transporter whose translocation to the
plasma membrane is regulated by insulin-stimulated Akt signaling
(reviewed in reference [65]). GLUT-4 is transcriptionally up￾regulated during adipocyte differentiation in order to assure that
glucose uptake into adipose tissue is tightly coupled to the insulin
response. However, GLUT-4 levels have been found to be
decreased in the adipose tissue of a variety of rodent models of
insulin resistance (e.g., reviewed in reference [66]). Interestingly,
unlike other adipocyte markers, Glut-4 transcript levels are not
induced in differentiating Tsc22/2 cells, with expression levels
being approximately five-fold lower in fully differentiated Tsc22/2
adipocytes than in Tsc2+/+ adipocytes (Figure 2D). The increased
lipid levels in Tsc2-deficient adipocytes indicate that these cells
must possess alternative mechanisms of carbon/glucose uptake.
Previous studies have suggested that, along with a decrease in
GLUT-4 expression [67,68], conditions of obesity and insulin
resistance can be accompanied by increased expression of the
constitutive glucose transporter GLUT-1 in adipose tissue (e.g.,
reference [69]). The Glut-1 gene is a target of the hypoxia￾inducible factor-1a (HIF1a) transcription factor, which is upregu￾lated by mTORC1 signaling in TSC-deficient cells ([70,71]; K.D.
and B.D.M., unpublished data). Indeed, Glut-1 transcript levels
were found to be elevated in the Tsc22/2 adipocytes relative to
their wild-type counterparts, and rapamycin treatment blocked
this expression (Figure 2E). However, rapamycin had only
minimal effects on Glut-4 expression (Figure 2F). These findings
demonstrate that Tsc2-deficient adipocytes are insulin resistant
and mimic some aspects of insulin resistant adipose tissue from
rodent models, including down-regulation of IRS proteins and
GLUT-4 and increased expression of GLUT-1.
Tsc2 knockdown in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes enhances
adipogenesis
In order to further confirm the role of the TSC1-TSC2 complex
and mTORC1 in regulating adipocyte differentiation, we utilized
3T3-L1 preadipocytes as a well-established model for this process.
We generated 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting
Tsc2 or firefly luciferase as a control. Efficient shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Tsc2 leads to constitutive activation of mTORC1 in
3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as detected by increased basal phosphor￾ylation of its downstream target S6K1 (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
these cells exhibit mTORC1-driven insulin resistance, as detected
by a decrease in the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt,
which is rescued by pre-treatment with rapamycin. Consistent
with the findings in differentiated Tsc12/2 and Tsc22/2 MEFs,
Tsc2 knockdown yields adipocytes displaying enhanced oil red O
staining (Figure 3B) and increased intracellular triglycerides
(Figure 3C) relative to control cells. As expected, rapamycin
blocks lipid accumulation in both control and Tsc2 knockdown
cells, further demonstrating an essential role for mTORC1 in
adipogenesis.
mTORC1 drives PPARc mRNA expression
In order to explore the mechanism of mTORC1-driven
adipogenesis, we focused on components of the well-known
transcriptional cascade underlying this differentiation program
(reviewed in reference [72]). In differentiation medium, transcript
levels for the adipogenic transcription factors PPARc and C/
EBPa peak at day 2 of differentiation in Tsc2+/+ MEFs (Figure 4,
panels A and B). Pparg transcript levels are strikingly elevated in
Tsc2-deficient MEFs, even at day 0 of differentiation, and remain
high throughout adipogenesis (Figure 4A). However, Cebpa
transcript levels follow a similar pattern in differentiating Tsc2+/+
and Tsc22/2 cells (Figure 4B). The protein levels of the major
adipogenic transcription factors were examined following 48 h of
differentiation in the presence or absence of rapamycin
(Figure 4C). Of these factors, only PPARc levels are elevated in
differentiating Tsc22/2 MEFs relative to Tsc2+/+ MEFs, and in
fact, C/EBPb and d levels are decreased in these cells.

Importantly, the increase in PPARc levels is sensitive to
rapamycin. It is worth noting that the levels of FOXO family
members are similar in wild-type and Tsc2 null cells at this stage of
differentiation, and consistent with loss of Akt signaling, these
transcription factors remain hypophosphorylated in the null cells
(Figure 4C). An mTORC1-dependent increase in PPARc is also
seen in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, described above, following stable
shRNA-mediated knockdown of Tsc2 (Figure 4D). Prior to
differentiation, Tsc22/2 MEFs express greatly elevated levels of
both the PPARc protein (Figure 4E) and transcript (Figure 4F),
and these are dependent on elevated mTORC1 signaling, as
indicated by their sensitivity to rapamycin. Therefore, loss of the
TSC genes results in an mTORC1-driven transcriptional
induction of Pparg, resulting in elevated levels of PPARc protein
and an enhanced adipogenic program.
Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2
promotes adipogenesis
Given the well-defined signaling changes in Tsc22/2 cells, where
constitutive mTORC1 signaling is accompanied by loss of Akt
activity, the above data strongly suggest that mTORC1 activation
downstream of Akt is sufficient to drive adipogenesis. A primary
mechanism by which Akt activates mTORC1 is through phosphor￾ylation and inhibition of TSC2 within the TSC1-TSC2 complex
(Figure 5A; [21,22]). Akt has been found to phosphorylate four or
five distinct sites on TSC2, but only two of these sites are conserved
and phosphorylated in Drosophila TSC2 (S939 and T1462; [73]).
Previous studies have found that overexpression of a mutant of
TSC2 lacking these two conserved sites (TSC2S939A/T1462A, referred
to here as TSC2-2A) can dominantly inhibit insulin-stimulated
mTORC1 signaling [22]. However, in similar overexpression
studies in wild-type cells, roles for the additional phosphoryla￾tion sites, which are conserved in TSC2 from all vertebrates,
have also been suggested [21,74]. In order to more rigorously test
the relative importance of these phosphorylation sites under
conditions where TSC2 is expressed at more physiological levels
without interference from endogenous TSC2, we stably reconsti￾tuted Tsc22/2 MEFs with empty vector, wild-type TSC2, TSC2-2A,
or a mutant lacking all five previously identified Akt sites
(TSC2S939A/S981A/S1130A/S1132A/T1462A, referred to here as TSC2-
5A) via retrovirus infection. As expected, introduction of wild-type
TSC2 or the phosphorylation-site mutants blocked mTORC1-
dependent feedback effects on IRS-1, as detected by decreased S307
phosphorylation, increased electrophoretic mobility, and increased
levels of IRS-1 (Figure 5B). Reflecting differential effects on
mTORC1 signaling, the TSC2-5A mutant renders a more
complete loss of S307 phosphorylation and downshift of the IRS￾1 protein than wild-type TSC2 or the TSC2-2A mutant. Acute
insulin stimulation of Akt phosphorylation was restored in the three
TSC2-reconstituted lines but not in cells expressing empty vector,
which remained insulin resistant.

adipocyte differentiation. (A) Model of insulin stimulation of mTORC1 signaling via Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 (Top). Akt activation
downstream of IRS1/2 and PI3K leads to phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2, thereby relieving its inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Consequent

the TSC2-5A mutant, demonstrating that the additional phos￾phorylation sites on vertebrate TSC2, not found on Drosophila
TSC2, are essential for Akt-mediated activation of mTORC1.
In order to determine the adipogenic role of TSC2 phosphor￾ylation and inhibition by Akt, we compared the capacity of Tsc22/2
MEFs expressing empty vector, wild-type TSC2, or the TSC2-5A
mutant to differentiate into adipocytes. In support of our findings
with littermate-derived wild-type and TSC-deficient MEFs
(Figure 1), Tsc22/2 MEFs reconstituted with wild-type TSC2
yielded fewer adipocytes with a significant reduction in intracellular
triglyceride levels compared to vector control cells (Figure 5, panels
D and E). Interestingly, Tsc22/2 MEFs reconstituted with the
TSC2-5A mutant were further reduced in their capacity to
differentiate into adipocytes (Figure 5D) and accumulated lower
levels of intracellular triglycerides than the cells expressing wild-type
TSC2 (Figure 5E). Consistent with the mTORC1-dependent
increases in PPARc expression detected in Tsc2-deficient MEFs
and 3T3-L1 cells (Figure 4), a corresponding decrease in PPARc
levels was observed in the TSC2 and TSC2-5A-reconstituted MEFs
at the time of differentiation (Figure 5F). Therefore, despite robust
restoration of insulin signaling to Akt in the TSC2-5A-reconstitutied
cells (Figure 5B), loss of the ability of Akt to phosphorylate TSC2
and activate mTORC1 in these cells leads to decreased adipocyte
differentiation. These findings demonstrate that TSC2 phosphor￾ylation is a major contributing factor to the essential role of Akt in
adipogenesis.
Renal angiomyolipoma from TSC patients contain fat and
smooth muscle-like cells exhibiting elevated levels of
mTORC1 signaling and PPARc
The mTORC1-dependent adipogenic effects of TSC gene
disruption in cell culture, described above, are likely to contribute
to the aberrant appearance of adipocytes within renal AMLs from
TSC and LAM patients. As with the smooth muscle-like cells
within AMLs, these adipoctyes display LOH at the TSC1 or
TSC2 locus [49], demonstrating that they are part of the
neoplastic lesion. To examine the major signaling defects found
in cultured TSC-deficient adipocytes in these tumors, we
compared normal human adipose tissue to AML tissue from
TSC patients (Figure 6). Phospho-S6 staining was detected
predominantly in the cytosol of the adipocytes, which is proximal
to the cell surface due to the large lipid droplet, and the AML￾associated adipose tissue appeared to have elevated levels of

phospho-S6. The smooth muscle-like AML cells also exhibit high
levels of phospho-S6 staining (Figure 6, bottom sample).
Adipocytes from normal fat tissue contained a single focus of
PPARc staining, indicative of their mononucleated nature.
However, the aberrant adipocytes within the AMLs were often
multinucleated with each nuclei staining positive for PPARc
(Figure 6, see higher magnification insets). Interestingly, both the
adipose and smooth muscle components of the AMLs displayed
elevated levels of nuclear PPARc. In support of these immuno￾histochemistry findings, data from a gene expression array
experiment demonstrate that PPARG transcript levels are greatly
elevated in human AML samples relative to normal kidney (Figure
S4). Therefore, like cell culture models lacking a functional TSC1-
TSC2 complex, tumor cells from TSC patients display elevated
mTORC1 signaling and PPARc expression.
Discussion
While there have been great strides in our understanding of the
transcriptional program driving adipocyte differentiation, much
less is known regarding upstream signaling pathways instituting
hormonal control over the process (reviewed in reference [72]).
Amongst critical signaling components downstream of insulin,
IRS-1/2 and Akt1/2 have been found previously to be essential
for proper upregulation of PPARc and induction of adipogenesis
in cell culture models (e.g., references [1–4,61,75,76]). Our study
takes advantage of signaling defects triggered by loss of the TSC1-
TSC2 complex to determine the contributions of specific branches
downstream of these proteins. In this setting where IRS-1 and
IRS-2 levels are decreased and Akt is unresponsive to insulin, we
find that mTORC1 activation alone can drive PPARc expression
and adipogenesis. As a gain of function model for mTORC1, this
study with TSC1/2-deficient MEFs and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
provides critical support to previous studies suggesting involve￾ment of mTOR signaling in PPARc-driven adipocyte differenti￾ation, which used rapamycin alone to establish this link [12–15].
Given that prolonged rapamycin can inhibit mTORC2 assembly
and function [45], it is possible that some of the inhibitory effects
of rapamycin on differentiation are due to loss of Akt signaling, as
detected in at least one study [12]. In cells lacking the TSC1-TSC2
complex, mTORC2 and Akt are already inhibited [55], assuring
that the effects of rapamycin on these cells are due to mTORC1
inhibition. Therefore, using rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 and
Tsc gene disruption to activate it, our data strongly indicate that
mTORC1 activation is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate
PPARc expression and adipocyte differentation.
Our study also identifies TSC2 as a critical downstream
substrate of Akt in the induction of adipocyte differentiation.
Previous studies have identified five distinct sites on TSC2 that are
likely phosphorylated by Akt in vivo [21,22,74]. Two of these sites
(S939 and T1462) are conserved and phosphorylated in Drosophila
TSC2 [73], whereas the other three sites (S981, S1130, and
S1132) are conserved in all vertebrate versions of TSC2. Previous
overexpression studies with phosphorylation-site mutants in
otherwise wild-type cells have lead to ambiguous results regarding
the relative importance of the different sites [21,22,74]. Through
the stable reconstitution of Tsc22/2 MEFs with wild-type and
mutant TSC2, we find a critical role for the vertebrate-specific sites
on TSC2, in addition to those conserved back to Drosophila. While
the TSC2S939A/T1462A (TSC2-2A) mutant lead to partial attenu￾ation of mTORC1 signaling, expression of the TSC2S939A/S981A/
S1130A/S1132A/T1462A (TSC2-5A) mutant resulted in a complete
block in the ability of insulin to stimulate mTORC1 signaling
events. Importantly, both wild-type TSC2 and the phosphoryla￾tion-site mutants were equally efficient at restoring insulin￾stimulated Akt signaling to these cells. Therefore, while it is likely
that multiple mechanisms exist for Akt to activate mTORC1
signaling, our studies demonstrate that multi-site phosphorylation
of TSC2 is essential for this regulation in MEFs. In support of a
role for Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 in promoting
adipocyte differentiation, MEFs reconstituted with the TSC2-5A
mutant were severely blunted in their ability to take on an
adipocyte morphology and accumulate intracellular triglycerides
relative to those reconstituted with wild-type TSC2. The fact that
some basal differentiation still occurs in these cells, where
mTORC1 signaling is blocked, suggests that reactivation of IRS￾1/Akt signaling upon TSC2 reconstitution in this setting might
provide an mTORC1-independent input into adipocyte differen￾tiation. Therefore, while our study demonstrates a critical role for
the Akt-TSC2-mTORC1 signaling pathway in this process, it is
likely that other branches of Akt signaling, such as FOXO1
phosphorylation and inhibition [8], play additional and, perhaps,
partially redundant roles in promoting adipogenesis.
Our study demonstrates close ties between mTORC1 activation
and inhibition and corresponding increases and decreases in both
mRNA and protein levels of the adipogenic transcription factor
PPARc, which is both necessary and sufficient for adipocyte
differentiation [7]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which
signaling pathways regulate PPARc levels are poorly understood.
Previous studies have found that prolonged rapamycin treatment
blocks 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, and this coincides with a
decrease in both C/EBPa and PPARc mRNA and protein levels,
with no change in C/EBPb or C/EBPd [15]. The data presented
here demonstrate that mTORC1 activation is sufficient to increase
PPARc expression, even in the absence of other signaling inputs
from Akt. We have also examined the mRNA and protein levels of
the other known adipogenic transcription factors, which can
regulate Pparg expression. We have detected an increase in C/
EBPa transcript levels in TSC-deficient adipocytes, but unlike
PPARc, we have not detected an increase in C/EBPa protein
levels. Furthermore, C/EBPb and C/EBPd protein levels are
actually lower in differentiating Tsc22/2 MEFs. Therefore, there
appears to be an mTORC1-dependent mechanism promoting
Pparg transcription.
Renal AMLs are amongst the most prevalent tumor in TSC and
LAM patients and are the source of significant morbidity due to
their propensity to hemorrhage [47]. In these patient populations,
AMLs can grow to sizes greater than the kidney and occupy large
areas of the body cavity. The most unusual characteristic of these
tumors is that they are comprised of smooth muscle-like cells and
adipocytes, both of which display LOH at the TSC1 or TSC2 locus
[49]. The prevailing model for the origins of this tumor is that a
mesenchymal precursor cell undergoes a second genetic hit at one
of the TSC loci, rendering the cell defective for TSC1-TSC2
complex function and, thereby, activating mTORC1. Following
increased growth and proliferation, the progeny of this cell
aberrantly differentiate into these mesenchymal cell types [47]. It
seems likely that the mTORC1-dependent increase in PPARc
expression described in this study could account for the abundance
of adipocytes in the majority of AMLs from these patients. To this
end, we find that both the adipocytes and smooth muscle-like cells
in TSC-associated AMLs express high levels of nuclear PPARc.
The somewhat surprising expression of PPARc in the smooth
muscle-like cells suggests that either this transcription factor is also
involved in the differentiation of this cell type or that, perhaps, the
adipose component of the AML is derived from the smooth muscle
through a PPARc-driven transdifferentiation process. With respect
to therapeutics, our findings suggest that PPARc agonists, such as
TSC2-mTOR Control Adipogenesis

the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone, might futher stimulate the
putative TSC-deficient precursor cells to differentiate and,
therefore, limit their capacity to proliferate and/or migrate.
This study adds adipogenesis to the increasingly diverse array of
processes to which mTORC1 activity has been attributed. It is
clear that the consequences of mTORC1 activation vary
significantly in different cell lineages. Therefore, understanding
the role of mTORC1 signaling in human development, physiol￾ogy, and disease requires studies geared toward defining these
tissue-specific functions. Such studies are also important to
comprehend the systemic effects of mTORC1 inhibitors, which
are now being tested as therapeutics for a number of clinical
conditions, including TSC and LAM.
