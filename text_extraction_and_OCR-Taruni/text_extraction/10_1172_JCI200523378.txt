Angiotensin II, acting through type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptors, has potent effects that alter renal excretory 
mechanisms. Control of sodium excretion by the kidney has been suggested to be the critical mechanism for 
blood pressure regulation by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, since AT1 receptors are ubiqui￾tously expressed, precisely dissecting their physiological actions in individual tissue compartments including 
the kidney with conventional pharmacological or gene targeting experiments has been difficult. Here, we used 
a cross-transplantation strategy and AT1A receptor–deficient mice to demonstrate distinct and virtually equiva￾lent contributions of AT1 receptor actions in the kidney and in extrarenal tissues to determining the level of 
blood pressure. We demonstrate that regulation of blood pressure by extrarenal AT1A receptors cannot be 
explained by altered aldosterone generation, which suggests that AT1 receptor actions in systemic tissues such 
as the vascular and/or the central nervous systems make nonredundant contributions to blood pressure regu￾lation. We also show that interruption of the AT1 receptor–mediated short-loop feedback in the kidney is not 
sufficient to explain the marked stimulation of renin production induced by global AT1 receptor deficiency 
or by receptor blockade. Instead, the renin response seems to be primarily determined by renal baroreceptor 
mechanisms triggered by reduced blood pressure. Thus, the regulation of blood pressure by the RAS is medi￾ated by AT1 receptors both within and outside the kidney.
Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), acting through type 1 
angiotensin (AT1) receptors, is a master regulator of fluid homeo￾stasis (1). The critical role of this pathway in regulation of blood 
pressure is highlighted by the impressive efficacy of angiotensin￾converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs) in patients with hypertension and in mice lacking 
the AT1A receptor, the major murine AT1 receptor isoform. These 
animals have very low blood pressure and profound salt sensitivity 
(2, 3). Control of sodium excretion by the kidney has been suggest￾ed to be the critical mechanism for blood pressure regulation by 
the RAS (4). However, as AT1 receptors are ubiquitously expressed, 
precisely dissecting and quantifying their physiological actions in 
individual tissue compartments including the kidney has been dif￾ficult. Accordingly, there is no direct proof of the primacy of the 
kidney in regulation of blood pressure by the RAS.
At the cellular level, responsiveness to angiotensin II is conferred 
by expression of angiotensin receptors. Angiotensin receptors can 
be divided into 2 pharmacological classes, type 1 (AT1) and type 2 
(AT2), based on their differential affinities for various nonpeptide 
antagonists (5). Studies using these antagonists suggested that 
most of the classically recognized functions of the RAS are medi￾ated by AT1 receptors (6). Gene targeting studies confirmed these 
conclusions (7). AT1 receptors from a number of species have been 
cloned (8, 9), and 2 subtypes, designated AT1A and AT1B, have been 
identified in rat and mouse (10). The murine AT1 receptors are 
products of separate genes and share substantial sequence homol￾ogy (10). AT1A receptors predominate in most organs, except the 
adrenal gland and regions of the CNS, where AT1B expression may 
be more prominent (10). A single report has suggested that AT1B
receptors might also exist in humans (11), but this has not been 
confirmed in the unpublished work of several independent groups, 
and the consensus view is that there is no human counterpart to 
the murine AT1B receptor. Thus, the AT1A receptor is considered 
the closest murine homolog to the single human AT1 receptor.
AT1 receptors can be found in organ systems that play key roles 
in blood pressure homeostasis, including the heart, kidney, blood 
vessels, adrenal glands, and cardiovascular control centers in the 
brain (5). In the vascular system, stimulation of AT1 receptors 
causes potent vasoconstriction (2). In the adrenal cortex, their 
activation stimulates the release of aldosterone (12), thereby pro￾moting sodium reabsorption in the mineralocorticoid-responsive 
segments of the distal nephron (13). In the brain, intraventricu￾lar injection of angiotensin II causes a dramatic pressor response 
mediated by AT1 receptors (14). In the kidney, activation of AT1
receptors is associated with renal vasoconstriction and antinatri￾uresis (15, 16). Furthermore, it has been suggested that activation 
of AT1 receptors at the juxtaglomerular apparatus suppresses renin 
release through the so-called short-loop feedback mechanism (17, 
18). While AT1 receptors have actions in myriad tissues that could 
potentially influence blood pressure, a prevailing view is that the

actions of the RAS to influence kidney function are dominant 
in chronic control of blood pressure (4, 19). Identifying the tis￾sues and cell lineages responsible for blood pressure regulation by 
the RAS will provide novel insights into the integrated control of 
blood pressure and will more precisely define the mechanisms of 
the antihypertensive actions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Here, we 
used a cross-transplantation strategy and AT1A receptor–deficient 
mice to demonstrate distinct and virtually equivalent contribu￾tions of AT1 receptor actions in the kidney and in extrarenal tis￾sues to determining the level of blood pressure.
Results
Cross-transplantation strategy. In order to define the relative impor￾tance of renal versus nonrenal AT1 receptor pools in blood pressure 
regulation by the RAS, we carried out cross-transplantation experi￾ments, performing fully vascularized kidney transplants between 
genetically matched F1(C57BL/6 × 129) wild-type mice and mice 
homozygous for a targeted disruption of the Agtr1a gene locus 
encoding the AT1A receptor. In the resulting recipient animals, both 
adrenal glands were retained. As shown in Figure 1, by varying the 
genotype of the transplant donors and recipients, we generated 4 
groups of animals in which renal function was provided entirely 
by the single transplanted kidney. Group I animals were Agtr1a+/+
recipients (R+) that were transplanted with kidneys from 
Agtr1a+/+ donors (D+) and thus had normal expression of 
AT1A receptors in the donor renal and recipient nonrenal tis￾sues (D+R+). We will refer to group I as the D+R+ group, since 
AT1A receptors were present in both kidney and somatic tis￾sues. Group II animals lacked expression of AT1A receptors 
in the kidney, but had normal expression of receptors in systemic 
tissues (D–R+). In group III, AT1A receptors were present in the kid￾ney but absent from all nonrenal tissues (D+R–). Finally, group IV 
mice were completely deficient in AT1A receptors (D–R–).
Blood pressure measurements in Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a–/– mice. In order 
to accurately measure blood pressures in conscious, unrestrained 
animals, we implanted radiotelemetry transmitters. Using this 
approach, we first measured blood pressures in otherwise unma￾nipulated Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a–/– mice. Figure 2A shows that 
blood pressures were significantly reduced in F1(C57BL/6 × 129) 
Agtr1a–/– mice (89 ± 8 mmHg) compared with wild-type controls 
(112 ± 3 mmHg; P = 0.03). The magnitude of the blood pressure 
reduction in Agtr1a–/– animals was very similar to that observed in 
our previous experiments using tail cuff manometry (2). We also 
analyzed a series of 24-hour blood pressure recordings and found 
that the general nature of blood pressure fluctuations was similar 
in Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a–/– mice (Figure 2B), which indicated that 
the absence of AT1A receptors does not affect qualitative patterns 
of diurnal variation in blood pressure.
Distinct contributions of renal and systemic AT1 receptors to blood pres￾sure homeostasis. Among the transplanted animals, blood pressures 
in group I (D+R+) were very similar to those of nontransplanted, 
Agtr1a+/+ control mice (118 ± 5 vs. 112 ± 3 mmHg; P = 0.44), which 
indicated that the transplant procedure does not significantly alter 
blood pressure. Figure 3 shows that the absence of AT1A receptors 
in the kidney alone in group II (D–R+) animals was associated with 
a significant reduction in blood pressure compared with the D+R+
group (99 ± 4 vs. 118 ± 5 mmHg; P = 0.006 vs. D+R+). This finding 
is consistent with the prevailing view that regulation of sodium 
handling by the kidney is a major determinant of the chronic level 
of blood pressure and indicates that the absence of AT1A recep￾tor pathways in the kidney alone is sufficient to lower blood pres￾sure. However, blood pressures were similarly reduced in group 
III (D+R–) mice, which lack AT1A receptors in systemic tissues but 
have normal renal expression of AT1A receptors (99 ± 2 vs. 118 ± 5 
mmHg; P = 0.006). Thus, AT1A receptors in nonrenal tissues also 
make a nonredundant contribution to the determination of the 
blood pressure level. Moreover, the presence of intact AT1A recep￾tor pathways in the kidneys of these animals does not compensate 
for the absence of receptors outside of the kidney. With respect to 
blood pressure homeostasis, the finding that blood pressures were 
virtually identical in the D–R+ and D+R– groups indicates that the 
contributions of AT1A receptors in the kidney and systemic tissues 
are very similar in magnitude.
Blood pressures were further reduced in group IV (D–R–) ani￾mals, which completely lack AT1A receptors (86 ± 3 mmHg; P = 0.02

kidney. Group III animals (D+R–) expressed AT1A receptors only within

vs. D–R+; P = 0.002 vs. D+R–). This suggests that the mechanisms 
for control of blood pressure by systemic and renal AT1A receptors 
are nonoverlapping. Finally, blood pressures in D–R– animals were 
very similar to those measured in intact, nontransplanted Agtr1a–/–
mice (89 ± 8 mmHg), which further illustrates the lack of any sig￾nificant impact of the transplant procedure on blood pressure.
Effects of oral sodium loading on blood pressures. To assess the impact 
of altered sodium homeostasis on blood pressure regulation in the 
experimental groups, we examined the effects of high-salt feeding. 
After baseline blood pressures of mice on the normal (0.4% NaCl) 
diet were established, mice in each experimental group were fed a 
high-salt (6% NaCl) diet, and blood pressures were simultaneous￾ly monitored. As shown in Figure 4, the high-salt diet caused sig￾nificant increases in blood pressures only in the D–R+ (14.2% ± 5% 
[from 99 ± 4 to 114 ± 9 mmHg]; P = 0.03 vs. normal salt) and the 
D–R– (20.1% ± 4.9% [from 85 ± 3 to 102 ± 5 mmHg]; P = 0.01 vs. nor￾mal salt) groups, lacking AT1A receptors in the kidney. By contrast, 
in the D+R+ or D+R– groups with a normal complement of renal AT1A
receptors, high-salt feeding did not significantly affect blood pres￾sures (118 ± 5 to 122 ± 7 mmHg for D+R+, 99 ± 2 to 105 ± 3 mmHg 
for D+R–; P = not significant vs. normal salt in both groups). Thus, 
the absence of AT1A receptors in the kidney was associated with 
sodium sensitivity, whereas groups with normal renal AT1A receptor 
expression were sodium resistant.
Extrarenal AT1A receptors, aldosterone, and blood pressure. As dis￾cussed above, there are a number of direct actions of AT1 receptors 
that impact on blood pressure (19). In addition, AT1 receptors in 
the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland indirectly affect blood 
pressure by stimulating aldosterone release and, in turn, promot￾ing sodium reabsorption by the distal nephron (12, 13). We there￾fore considered the possibility that impaired aldosterone release 
might explain the blood pressure reduction that we observed in 
D+R– mice, which lack AT1A receptors in systemic tissues. To test 
this, we collected urine from animals in each of the experimental 
groups and measured urinary aldosterone levels by ELISA.
As shown in Figure 5, aldosterone excretion was equivalent in 
the D+R+ and D–R+ groups (2,395 ± 260 vs. 3,177 ± 649 pg/24 h), 
which is consistent with the fact that they have normal comple￾ments of adrenal AT1A receptors. In contrast, aldosterone excre￾tion was reduced by approximately 50% in D+R– animals, lacking 
AT1A receptors in nonrenal tissues including the adrenal glands 
(1,158 ± 207 pg/24 h; P = 0.005 vs. D+R+; P = 0.01 vs. D–R+), which 
suggests that the impaired aldosterone response in these animals 
is the cause of their reduced blood pressure. The aldosterone 
excretion in the D–R– mice, which completely lack AT1A receptors, 
was significantly higher than that in the D+R– group (2,643 ± 441 
pg/24 h; P < 0.05). Since the adrenal glands in D–R– mice also lack 
AT1A receptors, this augmented aldosterone excretion is likely 
due to marked renin stimulation (see below) generating a high 
level of angiotensin II that stimulates the AT1B receptors in the 
adrenal cortex. Other pathways for aldosterone stimulation may 
also play a role (20). Yet blood pressures are significantly lower 
in D–R– mice completely lacking AT1A receptors compared with 
those in the D+R– group, despite their higher aldosterone levels.
To determine whether lower aldosterone production in the D+R–
animals accounts for their lower blood pressures versus the D+R+
group, we performed an additional experiment using adrenalec￾tomized D+R+ and D+R– animals in which aldosterone levels were 
clamped by the infusion of equivalent amounts of aldosterone via 
an osmotic minipump. As shown in Figure 6A, infusing aldosterone 
at 1 μg/day provided supraphysiological aldosterone replacement, 
since urinary aldosterone excretion was increased almost 4-fold in 
the infused mice compared with mice with intact adrenal glands 
(P = 0.005). Nevertheless, this enhanced level of aldosterone had 
no effect on blood pressure in the D+R+ groups (118 ± 1 vs. 118 ± 5 
mmHg; P = not significant). Moreover, urinary aldosterone excre￾tion was not significantly different between the adrenalectomized 
D+R+ and adrenalectomized D+R– groups that received aldosterone 
infusions (8,020 ± 2,627 vs. 8,828 ± 1,364 pg/24 h, respectively; 
P = not significant). However, despite supraphysiological and 
equivalent aldosterone levels, blood pressures were significantly 
reduced in the aldosterone-infused D+R– group compared with the 
D+R+ group (106 ± 1 vs. 118 ± 1 mmHg; P < 0.0001) as shown in 
Figure 6B. These data demonstrate that regulation of blood pres￾sure by extrarenal AT1A receptors cannot be explained by changes 
in aldosterone generation, which indicates that AT1 receptor 
actions in other systemic tissues make nonredundant contribu￾tions to blood pressure regulation.
Extrarenal AT1A receptors and renal sympathetic innervation. The sym￾pathetic nervous system, acting through renal nerves can modu￾late sodium handling by the kidney (21). As AT1 receptors in the 
CNS can stimulate sympathetic tone (22, 23), we considered the 
possibility that altered neural input to the kidney might represent 
a mechanism for the altered blood pressures in the D+R– group. 
Furthermore, since the renal pedicle is transected in the course of 
harvesting the donor kidney, renal innervation may be impaired 
in this model. To examine these possibilities, we compared renal 
norepinephrine content in the D+R+ and D+R– groups with that of 
kidneys from Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a–/– mice. Norepinephrine content

is an accepted measure of renal sympathetic nerve activity (24). 
As shown in Figure 7, renal norepinephrine content was reduced 
significantly in both groups of transplanted kidneys compared 
with those in Agtr1a+/+ controls (P < 0.001), which suggested that 
significant re-innervation of the transplanted kidneys had not 
occurred during the period of study. As there was no difference 
in norepinephrine levels between kidneys from the Agtr1a+/+ and 
Agtr1a–/– mice (1,094 ± 132 vs. 1,286 ± 79 ng/g), the absence of AT1A
receptors does not substantially affect renal norepinephrine con￾tent in the presence of intact renal nerves. Furthermore, norepi￾nephrine levels were virtually identical in kidneys of the D+R+ and 
D+R– mice (173 ± 53 vs. 163 ± 75 ng/g), which indicates that altered 
sympathetic nerve input in the kidney cannot explain the reduced 
blood pressures in the D+R– animals.
Renal AT1A receptors and regulation of renin. Angiotensin II may 
regulate its own synthesis by activation of AT1 receptors at the 
juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), suppressing renin release (18). 
As this is one of several intrarenal actions of AT1A receptors that 
could affect blood pressure, we examined the impact of renal and 
systemic AT1A receptors on renin mRNA expression in the kidney.
We found that renin mRNA levels in transplanted kidneys of 
D+R+ animals (29 ± 8 pg of renin mRNA/μg total mRNA) were 
nearly identical to those of unmanipulated kidneys from wild-type 
mice (25 ± 4 pg of renin mRNA/μg total mRNA). In previous stud￾ies, we and others have described markedly enhanced renin expres￾sion and JGA hypertrophy in Agtr1a–/– mice with generalized defi￾ciency of AT1A receptors (25, 26). However, as shown in Figure 8, 
this phenotype was not recapitulated in D–R+ animals, which lack 
AT1A receptors only in the kidney. While kidney renin mRNA levels 
tended to be higher in D–R+ mice (59 ± 19 pg of renin mRNA/μg 
total mRNA) than in the D+R+ group, this difference was not sta￾tistically significant (P = 0.18). Thus, the absence of AT1A receptors 
only in the kidney and the consequent lack of short-loop feedback 
did not markedly alter renin mRNA levels. Similarly, the absence 
of AT1A receptors only in nonrenal tissues of D+R– animals had 
no effect on renin expression (22 ± 14 pg of renin mRNA/μg total 
mRNA) compared with the D+R+ group (Figure 8). By contrast, the 
simultaneous absence of AT1A receptors in both renal and nonrenal 
tissues of D–R– animals was associated with a marked upregulation 
of renin expression to 708 ± 161 pg of renin mRNA/μg total mRNA 
(P < 0.003 vs. all other groups). Based on the findings from the D–R+
group, interruption of short-loop feedback in the kidney cannot 
explain the more than 10-fold increase in renin mRNA levels in the 
D–R– group. Accordingly, we postulate that this marked augmen￾tation in renin expression is due to the lower blood pressures in 
this group. Moreover, since blood pressure reductions of almost 20 
mmHg in the D–R+ and D+R– groups were not sufficient to trigger 
this response, our data suggest that a threshold of blood pressure 
lowering must be achieved for activation of baroreceptor mecha￾nisms that stimulate renin (27, 28).
We performed additional experiments to examine the contribu￾tion of blood pressure to the stimulation of renin seen in the com￾plete absence of AT1A receptors. To this end, we measured blood 
pressure and renin mRNA expression in D–R– mice fed a high-salt 
(6% NaCl) diet. As in our previous experiments on unmanipulated 
Agtr1a–/– mice (3), high-salt feeding caused a significant increase in 
blood pressure in the D–R– mice (102 ± 5 mmHg) compared with 
D–R– mice fed a normal (0.4% NaCl) diet (86 ± 3 mmHg; P = 0.01). 
The blood pressures in the D–R– animals fed a high-salt diet increased 
sufficiently, becoming not significantly different from those of the 
D–R+ and D+R– groups on a normal diet (99 ± 4 and 99 ± 2 mmHg 
in D–R+ and D+R– groups, respectively). This normalized blood pres￾sure in the high-salt D–R– group was associated with a dramatic 
suppression of renin mRNA levels (130 ± 58 pg of renin mRNA/μg 
total mRNA) compared with the D–R– animals on the normal diet 
(708 ± 161 pg of renin mRNA/μg total mRNA; P = 0.003).
Discussion
The important role of the kidney in regulation of blood pressure 
has been long recognized (29), and the relationship between altera￾tions in systemic blood pressure and changes in renal sodium excre￾tion is well documented (30). For example, an elevation in perfusion 
pressure in the renal artery results in a rapid increase in sodium and 
water excretion by the kidney, so-called pressure natriuresis (30). 
Based on such observations, Guyton and coworkers suggested that 
whenever arterial pressure is elevated, activation of this pressure￾natriuresis mechanism will cause sufficient excretion of sodium 
and water to return systemic pressures to normal (31). Because of 
its potent actions to modulate renal sodium excretion, angiotensin 
II has been implicated as a major determinant of these pressure￾natriuresis relationships (19, 32). These actions may be mediated by 
direct effects of AT1 receptors on renal resistance vessels and epithe￾lial cells or indirectly through stimulation of aldosterone produc￾tion via AT1 receptors in the adrenal gland (32).

The importance of the RAS in clinical medicine is highlighted by 
the impressive cardiovascular efficacy of pharmacological agents 
that inhibit the synthesis or activity of angiotensin II. ACE inhibi￾tors and ARBs are very effective and well tolerated antihyperten￾sive agents (1). Along with their ability to lower blood pressure, 
these agents also ameliorate morbidity and mortality associated 
with cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, and stroke (33, 34). The remarkably simi￾lar profiles of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in these disorders suggest 
a common mechanism underlying their efficacy: reducing AT1
receptor signaling in critical target tissues. Along with their expres￾sion in the kidney, AT1 receptors are present not only in the kidney 
but in myriad sites that may influence blood pressure including 
the vasculature, adrenal glands, and brain. Yet the key sites that 
determine the level of blood pressure cannot be precisely localized 
using pharmacological antagonists that block AT1 receptors in all 
tissues or in conventional gene targeting experiments. Accordingly, 
in the studies described here, we have used a renal cross-transplan￾tation strategy to define the relative contributions of AT1A receptor 
actions in the kidney and in extrarenal tissues.
We found that absence of AT1A receptors in the kidney in D–R+
mice is sufficient to reduce blood pressure by almost 20 mmHg 
(Figure 3), despite normal expression of receptors in all other 
tissues. These findings indicate that renal AT1A receptors have 
unique and nonredundant actions in blood pressure homeostasis. 
As aldosterone levels are unaffected in these D–R+ animals, these 
observations show that blood pressure is regulated by direct effects 
of AT1 receptors on kidney cells, independent of any impact of min￾eralocorticoids. We suggest that this reduction in blood pressure 
is a direct consequence of interruption of AT1 receptor actions in 
the renal vasculature and/or renal epithelia that would otherwise 
reduce urinary sodium excretion. Our finding of sodium-sensitive 
blood pressure changes in animals lacking renal AT1A receptors 
is consistent with this conclusion. While the baseline blood pres￾sures were significantly lower in the D–R– compared with the D–R+
group, the absolute magnitude of the blood pressure increases 
with high-salt feeding were similar, 17 and 15 mmHg, respectively, 
representing the component of blood pressure reduction due to 
sodium and volume deficits. Furthermore, it is likely that inhibi￾tion of these intrarenal pathways is an important mechanism for 
blood pressure lowering by ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
Although our studies support a vital role for the kidney in regu￾lation of blood pressure, we find that AT1 receptors outside the kid￾ney also make a unique contribution to blood pressure homeosta￾sis that is virtually equivalent to and independent of the intrarenal 
actions of angiotensin II. Thus, we found that D+R– mice, which 
lack AT1A receptors in extrarenal tissues but have the normal 
complement of receptors in the kidney, also had blood pressure 
reductions of approximately 20 mmHg (Figure 3). We considered 
the possibility that alterations of aldosterone release due to the 
absence of AT1 receptors in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal 
gland might be responsible for low blood pressures in D+R– mice; 
this would be consistent with the hypothesis that control of 
renal sodium handling is the final common pathway for chronic 
blood pressure homeostasis. To test this possibility, we measured 
aldosterone excretion in D+R– mice and found that absence of AT1A
receptors only in extrarenal tissues was associated with a reduc￾tion in aldosterone excretion of approximately 50% compared with 
controls (Figure 5). Preservation of a partial aldosterone response 
in these mice is probably due to the presence of AT1B receptors, the 
minor murine AT1 receptor isoform. The adrenal cortex is one of 
the few tissues with appreciable expression of AT1B receptors (10).
In order to determine whether the reduced aldosterone genera￾tion in the D+R– mice was the cause of their low blood pressures, we 
clamped aldosterone at supraphysiological levels by chronic infu￾sion into adrenalectomized D+R– and D+R+ animals using osmotic 
pumps. The aldosterone levels in the 2 groups were similar, yet 
the blood pressures remained lower in the D+R– group lacking 
extrarenal AT1A receptors, compared with those in D+R+ controls 
(Figure 6B). These findings corroborate other studies in which 
infusion of aldosterone alone failed to raise blood pressure (35) 
and suggest that the adrenal gland is not a critical site for blood 
pressure control by extrarenal AT1A receptors. We speculate instead 
that AT1A receptors in the CNS and/or in the vasculature are more 
likely to mediate the component of blood pressure regulation that 
is independent of the kidney. As our data on renal norepinephrine 
content indicate a persistent lack of sympathetic innervation in 
the transplanted kidneys (Figure 7), the contribution of extrarenal 
AT1 receptors to enhancing or modulating renal nerve activity and 
thereby altering renal excretory functions may be underestimated 
in these experiments. Therefore, the major actions of extrarenal 
AT1 receptors to regulate blood pressure in this model are likely to 
be due to effects on the vasculature. These could be direct actions 
of AT1A receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (2) or indirect 
effects of AT1A receptors in the CNS to modulate vascular resistance 
(14). In this regard, recent studies have suggested that G-protein–
coupled receptor actions in vascular smooth muscle make impor￾tant contributions to chronic blood pressure homeostasis (36).
The availability of renin affects the generation of angiotensin II 
by the RAS, and renin expression is tightly controlled at the JGA

in the kidney (37). Angiotensin II is an important component in 
the regulatory pathways for renin and may control its own syn￾thesis by activating AT1 receptors at the JGA, thereby suppressing 
renin release (18, 25). The actions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs to 
increase renin mRNA expression and to cause JGA hypertrophy 
(38) have been cited as evidence supporting the existence of this 
so-called short-loop feedback mechanism. Although we find that 
renal AT1A receptors are key determinants of blood pressure, our 
studies do not indicate a major role for these receptors in regulat￾ing renin expression in the kidney.
In D–R+ animals, which lack AT1A receptors only in the kidney, we 
found that renin mRNA levels are not significantly elevated despite 
the absence of AT1 receptors at the JGA and the significant reduc￾tion in blood pressure (Figure 8). Yet in the D–R– group completely 
lacking AT1A receptors, renin mRNA expression is increased more 
than 10-fold above baseline. Because blood pressures are reduced 
even further in D–R– compared with D–R+ animals, we posit that 
renal baroreceptor mechanisms are primarily responsible for the 
marked stimulation of renin associated with interruption of AT1
receptor signaling (28). Moreover, since blood pressure reductions 
of almost 20 mmHg in D–R+ or D+R– groups were not sufficient to 
trigger an increase in renin expression, our data also suggest that a 
threshold of blood pressure lowering must be achieved before the 
baroreceptor mechanisms are activated to stimulate renin produc￾tion (27). The conclusion that blood pressure as such affects renin 
production is further supported by our observation that increasing 
blood pressure by dietary sodium loading significantly suppresses 
renin expression in D–R– mice. Taken together, our findings are 
consistent with previous studies by Matsusaka and colleagues 
showing that JGA hypertrophy is correlated with reduced blood 
pressure rather than with the absence of AT1 receptors at the JGA 
in chimeric AT1A-null mice (39).
In summary, AT1 receptors in the kidney have unique actions 
to determine the normal level of blood pressure. These are direct 
effects of AT1 receptors on kidney cells that are independent of 
aldosterone and likely target renal vasculature and/or epithelia to 
modulate sodium excretion. While the AT1A receptors in the kidney 
are key determinants of blood pressure, they do not have a major 
role in regulating renin expression. Instead, our data indicate that 
baroreceptor mechanisms are dominant in the stimulation of renin 
production that is associated with absence of AT1 receptor signal￾ing. We have also demonstrated that AT1 receptors outside the kid￾ney make unequivocal and unique contributions to blood pressure 
homeostasis. These actions of extrarenal AT1A receptors cannot be 
explained by altered aldosterone generation alone, and they affect 
the basal level of blood pressure despite the presence of intact AT1A
receptor pathways in the kidney. These studies illustrate the com￾plexity of blood pressure regulation by the RAS and suggest that 
maximal efficacy of ACE inhibitors and ARBs requires complete 
blockade of renal and extrarenal pathways. Because these pharma￾cological inhibitors only ameliorate but do not prevent progressive 
renal disease and other complications, a more precise understand￾ing of their mechanisms of blood pressure lowering and end-organ 
protection should lead to new opportunities for optimizing treat￾ments for hypertension and its complications.
Methods
Animals. Mice lacking AT1A receptors for angiotensin II were generated 
by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells as previously 
described (2). Animals were bred and maintained in the animal facility of 
the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center according to NIH guidelines 
with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of 
the Duke University and Durham VA Medical Centers. Agtr1a genotypes, 
designated “+” for the wild-type allele and “–” for the targeted allele, were 
determined by PCR analysis of DNA isolated from tail biopsies using 
the following primers: Agtr1a+/+ upstream (5′-GCATCATCTTTGTGGT￾GGG-3′) with a sequence common to both alleles, Agtr1a+/+ downstream 
(5′-ATCAGCACATCCAGGAATG-3′), and a sequence in the neomycin 
resistance cassette present only in the null allele (5′-TGCCGAGAAAG￾TATCCATCATGGCTGATGC-3′). F1(C57BL/6 × 129)Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a–/–
mice were generated from intercrosses of inbred 129/SvEv and C57BL/6 
Agtr1a+/– mice in which the Agtr1a mutation had been back-crossed onto 
each respective background for more than 12 generations. We studied male 
F1 mice that were 2–4 months old.
Mouse kidney transplantation. Transplantation of a single mouse kidney 
with bilateral native nephrectomy was performed as we have described 
previously (40). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the 
donor kidney, ureter, and bladder were harvested en bloc, including the 
renal artery with a small aortic cuff and the renal vein with a small caval 
cuff. These vascular cuffs were anastomosed to the recipient abdominal 
aorta and vena cava, respectively, below the level of the native renal vessels. 
Total ischemic time averaged 35–40 minutes. Donor and recipient bladders 
were attached dome to dome. The right native kidney was removed at the 
time of transplant, and the left native kidney was removed through a flank 
incision 1–3 days later; care was taken to preserve the recipient adrenal 
glands intact with their normal blood supply. Overall surgical mortality was 
approximately 5%. Each experimental group included at least 6 animals.
Data collection was initiated 2 weeks after transplantation to allow reso￾lution of any ischemic injury associated with the transplant procedure. 
In addition, at the end of the experiments, sections of kidney grafts were 
examined to confirm normal renal structure, including the absence of isch￾emic tubular damage. In previous studies, we have found that glomerular 
filtration rates in syngeneic mouse renal transplants are similar to those 
observed in uninephrectomized mice (40).
Radiotelemetry transmitter implantation. We used a radiotelemetry system 
(Transoma Medical) to monitor blood pressure in conscious mice, as 
described previously (41). Six to 8 days after the kidney transplantation 
procedure, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, and a pressure-sensing 
catheter was implanted into the left carotid artery, as described previously 
(42). The transducer unit was then inserted into a subcutaneous pouch 
along the right flank generated by blunt dissection inferiorly from the orig￾inal neck incision. Mice were allowed to recover for 7 days after surgery to 
regain their normal circadian rhythms before experiments were initiated. 
During the time that their blood pressures were being monitored, mice 
were housed in a monitoring room in the animal facility where quiet is 
maintained and no other activities are permitted. In separate experiments 
using identical procedures, catheters were also implanted into otherwise 
unmanipulated Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a–/– mice.
Blood pressure analysis. Arterial pressure recordings from unanesthetized, 
unrestrained animals were collected, stored, and analyzed using Dataquest 
A.R.T. software (version 2.2; Transoma Medical). The blood pressure data 
were collected continuously with sampling every 5 minutes for 10-second 
intervals (41) during the prescribed time periods. In some experiments, pres￾sures were recorded continuously for at least 48 hours. Otherwise, in order 
to conserve battery function, we carried out blood pressure measurements 
between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm during the appointed days of the protocol.
Experimental protocol. Baseline blood pressures were measured on 2 con￾secutive days while the animals ingested a conventional diet containing 
0.4% sodium chloride. Mean blood pressure values for each animal were 
computed as the average of these measurements. After baseline blood pres-

sure levels were established, mice from each of the experimental groups 
were placed on high-salt (6% NaCl) diet (Harlan Teklad) for 1 week while 
continuously monitoring blood pressures. After the blood pressure mea￾surements were taken, the mice were placed in metabolic cages, and urine 
was collected for 24 hours. Urinary aldosterone concentrations were deter￾mined by ELISA (Aldosterone Enzyme Immunoassay Kit) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Cayman Chemical). At the end of the experi￾ment, the animals were anesthetized, blood was collected via intracardiac 
puncture, and the transplanted kidney was harvested.
Aldosterone infusions. In separate experiments, we performed bilateral adre￾nalectomy on selected groups of transplanted animals and infused them 
chronically with aldosterone in order to clamp aldosterone levels within 
a uniform range. Adrenalectomies were performed coincident with the 
native nephrectomies. At the time of the second nephrectomy and adrenal￾ectomy, an osmotic minipump (ALZET model 2004; DURECT Corpora￾tion) containing aldosterone (A12930; Pfaltz & Bauer) and dexamethasone 
(D-1756; Sigma-Aldrich) was placed in a subcutaneous pouch. The doses of 
aldosterone (1 μg/day) and dexamethasone (1.2 μg/100 g body wt/d) were 
chosen to provide near-physiological replacement based on published stud￾ies (43, 44). The aldosterone and dexamethasone were dissolved in polyeth￾ylene glycol 400 (Sigma-Aldrich) (45) and further diluted in normal saline. 
All other experimental procedures were carried out as described above.
Measurement of renal norepinephrine levels. Kidney specimens were placed 
in cold 0.1 N HCl and were homogenized (24). To remove lipids from the 
homogenate, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The samples 
were then incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes and centrifuged (model 
5417C; Eppendorf North America) at 9,600 g for 5 minutes. Renal norepi￾nephrine was extracted from the supernatants and quantitated by enzyme 
immunoassay (NorAdrenaline EIA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (ALPCO Diagnostics).
Measurement of renin mRNA levels. Relative levels of mRNA for renin were 
determined by real time RT-PCR with the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detec￾tion System (PE Biosystems Inc.) as described previously (46). Kidneys were 
harvested, and total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit per the 
manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN). The nucleotide sequences of the 
PCR primers and their fluorogenic probes have been published previously 
(46). Real time RT-PCR amplifications were performed in a 96-well plate 
in the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems Inc.) as previ￾ously described (46). During the amplification, the fluorescence of FAM 
(or TET), TAMRA, and ROX (a passive reference dye) was measured by the 
7700 sequence detector in each well of the 96-well plate. The numbers of 
copies of the PCR template in the starting sample were calculated using 
the Sequence Detector Software (SDS) included in the ABI Prism 7700 
Sequence Detector System. A standard plasmid containing a DNA frag￾ment for the renin gene was used as an external control, and amplification 
of the β-actin gene was used as an endogenous control. For each experi￾mental sample, the amounts of the target and of the endogenous control 
were determined according to the appropriate standard curves.
Histopathology.To aid in the assessment of transplanted kidney viability, we 
fixed kidneys in formalin and sectioned and stained them with H&E. The 
histomorphology of these organs was then examined by light microscopy.
Statistical analysis. The values for each parameter within a group are 
expressed as the mean ± SEM. For comparisons between groups, statistical 
significance was assessed using ANOVA followed by unpaired Student’s t
test adjusted for multiple comparisons. A paired Student’s t test was used 
for comparisons within groups (normal salt vs. high salt).
