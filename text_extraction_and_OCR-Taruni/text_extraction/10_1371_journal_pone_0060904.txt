Abstract
The formation of fetuin-A-containing calciprotein particles (CPP) may facilitate the clearance of calcium phosphate
nanocrystals from the extracellular fluid. These crystals may otherwise seed extra-osseous mineralization. Fetuin-A is a
partially phosphorylated glycoprotein that plays a critical role in stabilizing these particles, inhibiting crystal growth and
aggregation. CPP removal is thought to be predominantly mediated by cells of the reticuloendothelial system via type I and
type II class A scavenger receptor (SR-AI/II). Naked calcium phosphate crystals are known to stimulate macrophages and
other cell types in vitro, but little is known of the effect of CPP on these cells. We report here, for the first time, that CPP
induce expression and secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.
Importantly, however, CPP induced significantly lower cytokine secretion than hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals of equivalent
size and calcium content. Furthermore, CPP only had a modest effect on macrophage viability and apoptosis, even at very
high levels, compared to HAP crystals, which were strongly pro-apoptotic at much lower levels. Fetuin-A phosphorylation
was found to modulate the effect of CPP on cytokine secretion and apoptosis, but not uptake via SR-AI/II. Prolonged
exposure of macrophages to CPP was found to result in up-regulated expression of SR-AI/II. CPP formation may help protect
against some of the pro-inflammatory and harmful effects of calcium phosphate nanocrystals, perhaps representing a
natural defense system for calcium mineral stress. However, in pathological states where production exceeds clearance
capacity, these particles may still stimulate pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cascades in macrophages, which may be
important in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification.

Introduction
Problems associated with mineral stress are known to occur in a
number of pathologies, especially in renal dysfunction. These
disorders are associated with the ectopic deposition of crystalline
mineral, particularly within the vasculature, mostly in the form of
basic calcium phosphate (BCP). Nanocrystals of BCP consisting of
calcium hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), or its precursor,
octacalcium phosphate (Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4 ?5H2O), have been
reported to strongly stimulate a number of cell types, in vitro. The
rise in intracellular calcium concentration that accompanies
lysosomal dissolution of internalized BCP crystals, or calcium
influx following direct or receptor-mediated crystal-cell interac￾tions, induces the synthesis of various intracellular and secreted
mediators, and alters membrane permeability and cell viability.
In the macrophage, BCP crystals induce secretion of tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-18, via Toll-like
receptor 4, protein kinase C-a/mitogen-activated protein kinase
and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing
family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome￾dependent pathways [1–5]. BCP crystals have also been shown
to induce the production of osteogenic proteins by vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMC), and cell death at high levels [6,7]. In
fibroblasts, on the other hand, exposure to BCP results in matrix
metalloproteinase production and a proliferative response [8–11].
BCP-induced apoptosis of VSMC may lead to atherosclerotic
plaque destabilization and rupture, while in the context of medial
arteriosclerosis, enhanced VSMC mineralization may potentiate
the loss of large vessel compliance [12,13]. BCP-induced
inflammation also contributes to cartilage deterioration, subchon￾dral remodeling and synovitis seen in severe osteoarthritis and
other destructive arthopathies [14,15]. Indeed intra-articular
deposition of BCP crystals is strongly associated with the severity
of cartilage degeneration [16]. Consequently, BCP crystals are
thought to play an important, but cell-specific, role in the genesis
of a number of pathologies.
Crystal size appears to be key a determinant of pro-inflamma￾tory and apoptotic potency. Crystals isolated from human aortic
and carotid atherosclerotic plaques have been found to range in
size from 50 nm to 8 mm [7,17], however, studies in both the
macrophage and VSMC suggest that only crystals less than 1–
2 mm in diameter stimulate a strong response [7,18]. Interestingly,
in studies of synthetic hydroxyapatite crystals released from
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60904

prosthetic implants, Laquerriere et al reported that needle-shaped
particles were most potently inflammatory [19], thus crystal shape
may also be important. To date, many studies have relied on
synthetic BCP crystals to assess their biologic effect, however,
in vivo, ‘naked’ crystals are not found in the circulation and cells
are unlikely to be exposed to insoluble mineral alone as it becomes
readily coated with various protein components of the extracel￾lular fluid in which they are bathed. Indeed, a study by Terkeltaub
and colleagues several decades ago showed that serum-coating of
hydroxyapatite significantly inhibited crystal-induced neutrophil
stimulation [20]. This inhibitory effect was found to be principally
due to the crystal-bound serum protein, fetuin-A. Fetuin-A (or a2-
Heremans Schmid glycoprotein) is an abundant, partially phos￾phorylated, glycoprotein secreted by the liver, which plays a
critical role in the formation and stabilisation of high molecular
weight protein-mineral complexes in extracellular fluid [21].
Fetuin-A binds and sequesters insoluble mineral nuclei, forming
soluble colloidal calciprotein particles (CPP), thereby inhibiting
crystal growth and aggregation [22]. Recent studies by Herrmann
and colleagues have provided compelling evidence that fetuin-A￾containing CPP facilitate clearance of mineral nanocrystals by
phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system via the type I and
type II class A scavenger receptor (SR-AI/II) [23]. Theoretically
therefore, prompt clearance of CPP may prevent seeding of extra￾osseous calcification and other potentially harmful effects of BCP.
In mice, ablation of the fetuin-A gene results in extensive soft￾tissue and myocardial calcification [24–26], while in humans with
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), fetuin-A deficiency has been
associated with increased arterial calcification scores and higher
mortality rates [27,28]. In a cohort of CKD patients, Hamano et al
found that serum fetuin-A-containing CPP levels were strongly
correlated with CT coronary artery calcification scores [29].
Expanding on these findings, we reported that higher CPP levels
were independently associated with aortic stiffness and serum
inflammatory markers, in a well-described cohort of pre-dialysis
CKD patients [30]. Subsequently, we have found measurable CPP
levels, normally undetectable in healthy controls, in inflamed
patients with chronic rheumatological disease, but without renal
impairment [31]. Intriguingly, and consistent with an earlier study
by Matsui et al on a rat model of CKD [32], we have also found
that virtually all of the fetuin-A circulating in CPP was in the
phosphorylated state [30]. The functional significance of this
remains obscure however, as fetuin-A phosphorylation does not
appear to be a requisite for CPP formation and inhibitory activity
in solution [30,33].
Given the apparent strong association between CPP levels and
inflammatory status, and the known pro-inflammatory response of
macrophages to calcium phosphate nanocrystals, the main aim of
the present study was to compare the effect of fetuin-A-containing
CPP and synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals on the inflam￾matory response, and viability, of murine RAW 264.7 macro￾phages in vitro. Further to this, we investigated the effect of fetuin-A
phosphorylation on CPP uptake, and cell fate, and the effect of
CPP exposure on SR-AI/II expression.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
All chemicals were purchased from Merck Millipore unless
otherwise stated. Synthetic hydroxyapatite crystals (,200 nm in
diameter) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (# 702153). High￾purity human serum albumin was sourced from Calbiochem
(#126658).
Preparation of Proteins and Calciprotein Particles
Human fetuin-A was obtained from Calbiochem (Cat# 362199)
and purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrepTM
16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE Healthcare Life Scienc￾es) equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and monitored at
l280. Dephosphorylated fetuin-A (dpFet-A) was produced by
enzymatic hydrolysis of purified natively-phosphorylated fetuin-A
(npFet-A) with high activity bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) in 0.10 M Tris-HCl pH 9.0 containing 0.05 M MgCl2,
0.1 mM dithiothreitol for 12 h at 37uC, as previously described
[30]. Dephosphorylation was monitored by phosphate-affinity
SDS-PAGE using a polyacrylamide-bound Mn2+
-phosphate￾binding tag (Phos-tag, Nard Institute, Hyogo, Japan), also as
previously described [30]. dpFet-A was exchanged into TBS and
purified from the reaction mix using a centrifugal ultrafiltration
unit with a 7 kDa MWCO membrane (Thermo Scientific), and by
gel filtration using a HiPrepTM 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR
column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated in TBS.
Relevant fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration
using a centrifugal unit with a 10 kDa MWCO membrane
(Sartorius AG). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting with polyclonal goat anti-human fetuin-A antibody
(#RD184036100, Biovendor). Final protein concentration was
determined by bicinchonic acid (BCA) assay at 562 nm (Thermo
Scientific). npFet-A and dpFet-A fractions were labeled with
AlexaFluor 488 carboxylic acid TFP ester using a commercially
available kit (Life Technologies), separated from free label using a
Zebra desalt centrifugal ultrafiltration unit with a 7 kDa MWCO
membrane (Thermo Scientific), snap-frozen in liquid N2 and
stored at 280uC until use.
Synthetic fetuin-A-containing CPP were prepared as previously
described [22]. Briefly, cryoprecipitates and aggregates were
cleared from protein stock solutions by centrifugation for 15 min
at 120006g and 4uC. 0.22 mm-filtered precipitation mix contain￾ing 1 mg/mL fetuin-A, 10 mmol/L CaCl2, 6 mmol/L Na2HPO4,
140 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was incubated

for 24 h at 37uC. CPP were harvested using centrifugal filter units
with a 300 kDa MWCO membrane (Sartorius AG). Total protein
concentration was determined by BCA assay, fetuin-A by ELISA
(Biovendor) and the ionic calcium content was measured by
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after acidifica￾tion in 2 mol/L HCl for 24 h to allow full crystal dissolution.
CPP were also purified from the pooled serum (30 mL) of 10
patients with pre-dialysis CKD. The CPP-containing fraction was
pelleted by centrifugation for 2 h at 220006g and 4uC, washed 3
times with ice-cold TBS before being re-suspended in warmed
buffer prior to separation by affinity chromatography using an
anti-human fetuin-A IgG (Biovendor) coupled CNBr-activated
Sepharose 6 MB resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Fetuin-A￾containing fractions were identified by Western blotting with anti￾human fetuin-A IgG (Biovendor), pooled and concentrated by
ultrafiltration with 300 kDa MWCO filter units. Total protein,
fetuin-A and calcium content were determined as before (79 mg/
mL protein, 33 mg/mL fetuin-A, 15 mg/mL calcium). Participat￾ing patients gave written informed consent. The study was
approved by local regional ethics committee (Eastern Health
Research and Ethics Committee ref: LLR31/1112) and was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Transmission Electron Microscopy and X-ray Elemental
Microanalysis
For cryo-electron microscopy, the sample was plunged frozen in
liquid ethane before observation on a Tecnai F30 (FEI, the
Netherlands) operating at 300 kV. Each micrograph represents an
exposure of 2,000 electrons per nm. For cell observation, isolated
cells were fixed at 4uC in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 7.4
containing 5 mM calcium chloride, 1% glutaraldehyde and 1.5%
formaldehyde. Cells were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide and
serially dehydrated before embedding in Epon. Seventy nanome￾ter sections were observed with a Tecnai F30 and micrograph
acquired with a 2 k62 k Ultrascan camera (Gatan, CA, USA). For
energy dispersive spectroscopy, isolated particles were absorbed on
a carbon coated copper grid for 30 seconds, rinsed with distilled
water and air-dried. The measurements were made in STEM
mode on the Tecnai F20 equipped with an EDAX detector (NJ,
USA) with an ultra-thin window.
Immunogold labeling was performed using a goat anti-human
fetuin-A antibody (1:100 dilution) and 10 nm gold-conjugated
rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (1:20 dilution) from Aurion
(#810.077). Goat anti-human ALP antibody (#sc-15065, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was substituted for the anti-fetuin-A primary
antibody as a control.

RAW 264.7 Cell Culture and Treatment
Mouse monocyte macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were obtained
from ECACC (Sigma) and were used between passages 3 and 11.
Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 25000 cells per
well and left to attach for 16 h in DMEM culture medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 IU/
mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin (all Gibco), at 37uC in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All experiments were
performed in the presence of 10% FBS unless otherwise stated.
HAP crystals (Sigma-Aldrich) were spin-filtered using cartridges
with a 300 kDa MWCO membrane (Sartorius AG) and
exchanged into TBS before addition to stock culture media.
Nanoparticle preparations were sonicated in culture medium for
1 min before use and were endotoxin free (,0.1 EU/mL). Cells
were then incubated with CPP or HAP-containing culture
medium or media control, at the concentrations indicated, for
24, 48 or 72 h. Since one of the primary objectives of this study
was to compare the effects of CPP and HAP, we defined ‘particle
exposure’ in terms of crystal calcium content. Concentration
ranges were chosen to reflect potentially pathological CPP￾associated calcium levels. In serum samples from CKD patients
we previously measured CPP-associated calcium levels in the
range 0.3–10 mg/mL (equivalent to approx. 0.5–16 mg/mL HAP)
[30]. However, given that CPP may accumulate to much higher
levels at sites of mineral stress (e.g. atherosclerotic lesions) we
determined to investigate that effect of nanoparticles over a
broader concentration range: 10–100 mg/mL (equivalent to
approx. 16–160 mg/mL or 6–60 mg/m2 HAP).
CPP Binding/uptake Experiments
For confocal microscopy RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 2-well
coverslips (Invitrogen) at a density of 10000 cells per well for 24 h
in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin. Adherent cells were then incubated with Alexa￾Fluor488-labelled fetuin-A-containing synthetic CPP in complete
culture medium for 30 minutes at 37uC. In order to differentiate
between cell-bound and internalized CPP, rabbit anti-Alexa￾Fluor488 IgG was used to quench cell-surface fluorescence. At
given time points, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and
incubated in PBS as control, or 80 mg/mL anti-AlexaFluor488
IgG in PBS (#A-11094, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4uC. Cells were

then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at
RT and mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen).
Images were captured using a Fluoview FV1000-IX81 confocal
microscope (Olympus).
To study CPP internalisation kinetics, RAW 264.7 cells were
seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well in
DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine for 12 h at 37uC. Adherent cells were then incubated
with AlexaFluor488-labelled fetuin-A-containing synthetic CPP
(100 mg/mL), and then subsequently with quenching antibody or
PBS alone as described above. The efficiency of cell-surface
quenching with anti-AlexaFluor488 IgG was estimated by
measuring the fluorescence after incubation of cells with labeled
CPP at 4uC, as CPP uptake should be minimal at this temperature.
Unquenchable fluorescence was determined at each time point
and accounted for 5 to 15% of the total cell-associated signal.
Internalization of CPP was calculated using the ratio of quenched
signal (intracellular CPP) to unquenched signal (combined cell￾surface and intracellular CPP) after correction for the unquench￾able fluorescence as described by Go¨ string et al [34]. Total cell￾associated fluorescence was measured using a Synergy HT
multimode plate reader with appropriate excitation/emission
filters (BioTek).
Given that FBS contains large amounts of bovine fetuin, serum￾free medium (Opti-MEM I, Gibco) was used to culture cells for the
assessment of monomeric fetuin-A uptake. Cells were washed and
cultured in serum-free medium for 2 h prior to treatment with
CPP or HAP-containing medium containing purified human
fetuin-A at the concentrations indicated.
To block apoptosis, cells were pre-incubated with 20 mmol/L z￾VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) for 1 h before treatment with CPP/HAP.
To block endocytosis via SR-AI, cells were pre-incubated with rat
monoclonal anti-mouse SR-AI blocking antibody (10 mg/mL,
#HM1061, Hycult Biotech) or rat IgG2b isotype control (10 mg/
mL, #14–4031, eBioscience) for 1 h prior to addition of CPP or
HAP-containing culture medium for a further 24 h.
Cell Viability, Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays
Cell viability was assessed by MMT assay of mitochondrial
activity (Sigma). RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 96-well plates at
5000 cells per well and left overnight to attach in DMEM culture
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. After 16 h,
cells were switched to culture medium containing CPP or HAP
crystals, at the stated concentrations, and incubated for 24 h.
MMT solution (5 mg/ml) was then added (10% vol/vol) and the
cells incubated at 37uC for a further 3 h. Formazan crystals
formed by living cells were dissolved in MMT solvent (0.1 mol/L
HCl in anhydrous isopropanol), and the absorbance measured at
570 nm (650 nm background subtracted).
For assessment of macrophage proliferation, RAW cells were
plated in 24-well plates at 10000 cells per well and left overnight in
culture medium. After attachment, the medium was changed to
DMEM supplemented with only 1.0% FBS for 48 h to induce
quiescence. This medium was then replaced with growth medium
(DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine)
with or without CPP/HAP, at the stated concentrations, for 48 h.
To quantitate the number of cells in culture, the medium was
aspirated and the cells gently scraped. Viable cells were identified
by trypan blue exclusion and were counted in a hemocytometer.
For the detection of apoptosis, cells were plated in 96-well plates
as for MMT assay, and then incubated in culture medium
containing CPP/HAP at the stated concentrations for 24 h (each
treatment, n = 16 replicates). After fixation (4% PFA in PBS for
15 min at RT) and permeabilisation of the cells (0.25% Triton X￾100 in PBS), plates were processed for a TUNEL (fluorescence
transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) based assay using
the Click-iT TUNEL Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Assay (Invitrogen).
DNase I-treated cells were used as a control. To confirm the
findings by TUNEL assay, replica plates were fixed with 80%
methanol in PBS and then processed for assay using the ssDNA
Apoptosis ELISA kit from Chemicon International. This assay has
high sensitivity (.500 apoptotic cells) and high specificity for
apoptosis showing no signal for hyperthermia/detergent-induced
necrosis or DNA breaks induced by hydrogen peroxide. S1
nuclease-treated cells were used as a negative control (Invitrogen).
Caspase-3 activity of whole-cell lysates was assessed using the
EnzChek kit obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). For this
assay, cells were seeded at a density of 25000 per well in 24-well
plates and then treated with CPP/HAP-containing culture
medium as before. Lysates were also prepared as previously
described. Activity was detected by cleavage of the fluorogenic
substrate Z-DEVD-AMC and the signal measured in a fluores￾cence microplate reader. Caspase 3 inhibitor peptide, Ac-DEVD￾CHO, was added to selected samples to ensure specificity of the
signal.
ELISA
Supernatants were collected, cleared from particulate debris by
centrifugation for 10 min at 10006g and 4uC, and stored at
280uC until analysis. TNF-a and IL-1b concentrations were
determined using kits from R&D Systems. 8-iso-PGF2a was
measured in whole cell lysates using a kit from Cayman Chemical
and normalized to total protein concentration determined by BCA
assay (Thermo Scientific). All measurements were made in
duplicate and the assays performed according to the manufactures
instructions.
Western Blotting
Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%

as mean 6 SD. Pairwise comparisons were made using the unpaired t-test; ns, not significant (P.0.05); *P,0.05; **P,0.01.

After treatment with the indicated reagents, cells were washed
once with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound particles before total
RNA was extracted using the Bio-Rad AURUM total RNA mini
kit. Reverse transcription (,1 mg per extract) was performed using
iScript RT supermix (Bio-Rad). cDNA products were diluted 1:5
in DNAse-free water prior to storage at 220uC until quantitative
PCR analysis. Real-time PCR analysis using SsoAdvanced SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and pre-designed, and pre-optimized

then 40 cycles of 95uC for 10 s, 60uC for 30 s followed by melt
curve analysis from 60–95uC in 0.5uC increments. PCR ampli￾fication specificities were evaluated by the examination of melt
curves to confirm the presence of single gene peaks. Dilution
experiments were performed to ensure reaction efficiencies of each

Results
Uraemic Human Serum Contains a Heterogeneous
Population of Fetuin-A Containing-CPP with an Apatite
Polycrystalline Core
Previous reports suggest that fetuin-A-containing CPP undergo
spontaneous transformation from relatively small (,100 nm)
spherical particles of amorphous calcium phosphate (‘‘primary
CPP’’), to larger, elongate spindle-shaped particles containing
crystalline calcium apatite (‘‘secondary CPP’’) [36]. To date, it has
not been demonstrated which species are present in uraemic
human serum.
Fetuin-A-containing CPP were isolated from pooled uraemic
serum by ultracentrifugation and affinity chromatography. Cryo￾TEM of this fraction showed the presence of a heterogeneous
population of elongate, spindle-shaped particles, with an electron￾dense core and ranging in size from approximately 80 to 200 nm
(Fig. 1A). The morphology of these particles is most in keeping
with that of secondary CPP first described by Jahnen-Dechent and
colleagues [37]. Anti-fetuin-A immunogold labeling displayed an
irregular but dense decoration of gold at the surface of these
particles, consistent with a fetuin-A-containing proteinacious ‘shell’
(Fig. 1B). Electron diffraction patterns of particles yielded a series
of concentric rings (Fig. 1C), confirming the presence of material
in a polycrystalline form. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectral
analysis showed strong peaks for Ca, P and O, with a calcium-to￾phosphate molar ratio (Ca/P) of 1.6760.03, consistent with
calcium apatite-like material (Fig. 1D).
Given the limited availability of serum-derived CPP material,
and the potential for co-purification of bioactive contaminants,
subsequent experiments were performed using synthetic secondary
CPP, unless otherwise indicated. This also allowed us to
specifically evaluate the effect of fetuin-A on crystal handling.
Synthetic CPP, isolated from precipitation medium 24 h after
mixing, showed near-identical morphology, size and a similar
diffraction pattern to serum-derived particles (Fig. 1E and 1F). As
expected, EDX analysis showed strong peaks for Ca, P and O,
with a Ca/P of 1.6760.02. Synthetic CPP were found to remain
intact and stable in culture medium for at least 5 days at 37uC,
with ionic calcium and phosphate concentrations remaining
unchanged over this period.
Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Expression is Attenuated by
Fetuin-A-containing CPP Compared to Naked
Hydroxyapatite Crystals
Several studies have reported that BCP nanocrystals (mainly as
hydroxyapatite, HAP) strongly stimulate the secretion of TNF-a
and IL-1b by monocyte-macrophage [1–5]. First, we tested
whether CPP induce a similar response in RAW 264.7 macro￾phages. Treatment of macrophages with CPP for 24 h (final
concentration: 10–100 mg/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent
increase in the expression of TNF-a and IL-1b, however this
effect only became significant at CPP levels above 80 mg/mL
(Fig. 2A and 2B, respectively). Up-regulated cytokine expression
was found to persist at 48 and 72 h post-treatment with 80 mg/mL
CPP (data not shown). Consistent with the increase in gene
expression, protein levels of TNF-a and IL-1b in the culture
medium also increased significantly with higher CPP levels, but
likewise only became significantly elevated at CPP levels above
60 mg/mL (Fig. 2C and 2D, respectively).
Comparison of cells treated with either synthetic or serum￾derived CPP showed a parallel trend towards increased TNF-a
expression with increasing CPP levels (Fig. 3A). Serum-derived
CPP, however, elicited significantly lower levels of TNF-a
expression over synthetic CPP at 100 mg/mL. We next sought
to compare the effect of CPP and HAP of equivalent size (100–
200 nm) and calcium content (final concentration: 10–100 mg/
mL) on cytokine production after 24 h treatment in respective test
media (Fig. 3B). Critically, compared to CPP-treated cells, HAP￾treated cells consistently yielded higher cytokine concentrations in
the culture medium across the concentration range tested,
particularly above 60 mg/mL.

Previous work, on several cell types, suggests that uptake of BCP
crystals also induces the generation of reactive oxygen species

macrophages. Adherent RAW 264.7 cells were pre-incubated with A–B, polyinosinic acid, at the concentrations indicated, or C–D, SR-AI/II blocking
antibody (or IgG2b isotype control, both at 10 mg/mL) prior to addition of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled fetuin-A-containing CPP (100 mg/mL) for a further
30 min. Cell-associated fluorescence and internalization was determined as before (n = 12 for each time-point). Both pre-treatments significantly
reduced cell-associated fluorescence and CPP uptake compared to controls, consistent with SR-AI/II pathway being a major route of CPP clearance. E,
pre-incubation of cells with SR-AI/II blocking antibody (10 mg/mL) also resulted in a significant reduction in CPP-induced TNF-a expression after 24 h

treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with CPP resulted in a dose￾dependent increase in expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), which was accompanied by increased intracellular 8-iso￾PGF2a production, a marker of oxidative stress, both of which
increased at CPP levels above 80 mg/mL, compared to control
levels (Fig. 4A and 4B). In HAP-treated cells however, both iNOS
expression and 8-iso-PGF2a levels were markedly elevated at
40 mg/mL after 24 h treatment (Fig. 4A and 4B).
Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay at 24 h after treatment
with either CPP- or HAP-containing media. While CPP treatment
resulted in a significant reduction in macrophage viability at
relatively high concentrations (80 mg/mL), HAP-treated cells
showed a significant reduction in viability at 40 mg/mL after
24 h (Fig. 5A). To determine whether the reduction in cell viability
was due to cell death, synchronized RAW 264.7 cultures were
stimulated to proliferate in CPP or HAP-containing media and the
number of cells was counted at 72 h post-treatment. Consistent
with the apparent loss of viability being due to cell death, the
number of cells was significantly reduced after treatment with
HAP compared to treatment with CPP-containing medium
(Fig. 5B). To investigate whether cells underwent apoptosis during
this period we applied a semi-quantitative, microplate-based
TUNEL assay to cells after 24 h incubation with CPP or HAP.
Again, CPP-treated RAW 264.7 cells showed increased apoptosis
at concentrations 80 mg/mL, whereas apoptosis was detected at
lower concentrations at 40 mg/mL with HAP-containing medium
(Fig. 5C). Comparable findings were made using an immunoassay
based on the sensitivity of DNA in apoptotic cells to formamide
denaturation. ssDNA levels were detectable above controls in cells
treated with HAP at 20 mg/mL, but only at 80 mg/mL with CPP￾containing media (Fig. 5D). Expression of caspase-3 was increased
after 24 h treatment with 40 mg/mL HAP-containing medium,
and at 80 mg/mL with CPP-containing medium (Fig. 5E).
Potentially therefore, the high concentrations of pro-inflammatory
cytokines observed in culture medium after exposure to high levels
of CPP/HAP may be due to release from dead or dying cells. Pre￾treatment of cells with z-VAD-fmk (20 mmol/L), a pan-caspase
inhibitor, significantly increased cell viability at 24 h compared to
cells treated with 80 mg/mL CPP or HAP alone (Fig. 5F).
Likewise, cell lysate caspase 3 activities, measured by cleavage of
the synthetic fluorescent substrate, Z-DEVD-AMC, were signifi￾cantly higher in HAP-treated cells compared to CPP-treated cells
after incubation for 24 h at .40 mg/mL (Fig. 5G).
Internalization of CPP by RAW 264.7 Cells
In keeping with the recent report by Herrmann et al [23], we
found that CPP were rapidly internalized by murine RAW 264.7
cells. Confocal microscopy of cells incubated with AlexaFluor488-
labelled fetuin-A-containing CPP (100 mg/mL) in DMEM culture
medium containing 10% FBS, showed internalization of particles
within 30 minutes (Fig. 6A). Quenching of cell-surface fluores￾cence with anti-AlexaFluor488 IgG confirmed localization of CPP
to intracellular compartments (Fig. 6A, right hand side panel).
Consistent with these findings, TEM of RAW 264.7 cells exposed
to synthetic (unlabeled) CPP for 1 hour showed uptake of particles
into vacuole-like structures near the cell surface (Fig. 6B & 6C).
Vacuolar inclusions containing CPP-like particles were not
observed in cells incubated in vehicle culture medium alone.
To study the kinetics of CPP internalization, we measured the
increase in cell-associated fluorescence of adherent RAW 264.7
cells cultured in 96-well plates and incubated with AlexaFluor488-
labelled fetuin-A-containing CPP (100 mg/mL) (Fig. 7A). After
incubation for up to 120 minutes at 37uC, cells were washed with
ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice, with or without (PBS only)
quenching of cell-surface fluorescence with 80 mg/mL anti￾AlexaFluor488 IgG for 1 h. Unquenchable cell-surface fluores￾Figure 9. CPP induce SR-AI/II expression in RAW 264.7

cence (,5–15%) was estimated by incubation of cells with labeled
CPP on ice before addition of quenching antibody (data not
shown). Internalization of CPP was estimated by calculating the
ratio of quenched fluorescence (intracellular CPP) to unquenched
signal (combined cell-surface and intracellular CPP) after correc￾tion for the unquenchable fluorescence at each time point. As
shown in Figure 7C, CPP internalization increased rapidly from
15 to 30 minutes and then increased steadily from 60 to 120
minutes. Pre-incubation of labeled-CPP or cells with culture media
containing unlabeled ‘free’ fetuin-A (at 150 mg/L and 300 mg/L)
or albumin had no significant effect on cell-associated fluorescence
(Fig. 7A) or CPP internalization (F-test, all P.0.1).
Fetuin-A Phosphorylation does not Effect CPP Uptake
but Modulates the Pro-inflammatory Response
Previously we reported that phosphorylated fetuin-A was the
main fetuin-A species present in CPP circulating in human serum
[30]. We speculated that phosphorylation may affect cellular
uptake, possibly due to differences in particle surface charge. CPP
synthesized using enzymatically-dephosphorylated fetuin-A
(dpFet-A), also subsequently labeled with AlexaFluor488, showed
similar uptake into RAW 264.7 cells compared to natively￾phosphorylated fetuin-A (npFetA)-containing CPP at the same
concentration (Fig. 7B and Fig. 7C). Indeed, even after 120
minutes, uptake of dpFet-A CPP and npFet-A CPP only differed
by 8%, which may be accounted for by the slightly higher degree
of labeling of the npFet-A CPP preparation (7.6 vs. 7.4 mol dye/
mol protein) or imprecision of the fluorometric measurements.
Interestingly however, we observed a greater increase in macro￾phage apoptosis with npFet-A-containing CPP compared to
dpFet-A CPP at high levels (Fig. 7D). dpFet-A-containing CPP
were also found to induce significantly lower TNF-a expression
compared to the same concentrations of npFet-A-containing CPP
(Fig. 7E). Indeed, at 100 mg/mL, dpFet-A-CPP had only 68% of
the stimulatory effect of npFet-A CPP on TNF-a expression.
CPP Exposure Up-regulates Expression of the
Macrophage Scavenger Receptor-A in vitro
Consistent with the findings of Herrmann et al [23], that CPP
are endocytosed by macrophage via the type I or II class A
scavenger receptor (SR-AI/II), we found that pre-incubation of
RAW 264.7 cells with the competitive scavenger receptor ligand,
polyinosinic acid (polyI), showed a dose-dependent reduction in
cell-associated fluorescence (mean RFU 125627 vs. 43613,
P,0.001) and in CPP internalization, 30 minutes after the
addition of CPP (Fig. 8A and 8B). Similarly, pre-incubation of cells
with SR-AI neutralizing antibody significantly reduced cell￾associated fluorescence (mean RFU 115622 vs. 58619,
P,0.001) and CPP uptake at 30 minutes Fig. 8C and 8D).
Consistent with CPP binding/uptake via the SR-AI being required
for downstream effects on cytokine secretion, TNF-a-induced
cytokine expression was significantly attenuated in cells treated
with SR-AI blocking antibody after 24 h incubation, compared to
cells pre-incubated with control IgG (Fig. 8E). Finally, we
considered the effect of CPP exposure on SR-AI/II expression
itself. After 24 h incubation with CPP, a significant increase in SR￾AI/II expression was observed at high CPP levels (Fig. 9A: 60–
100 mg/mL) and remained elevated over control levels for 72 h
(data not shown). Western blotting of whole-cell lysates also
revealed that SR-AI protein levels (relative to b-actin) were
significantly increased within 12 h exposure to 60 mg/mL (Fig. 9B
and 9C). Likewise, cells pre-incubated with z-VAD-fmk (20 mmol/
L) also showed a significant increase in SR-AI protein levels after
exposure to 60 mg/mL CPP for 12 h (Fig. 9C).
Discussion
Here we have demonstrated, for the first time, that high levels of
human fetuin-A-containing calciprotein particles (CPP) elicit a
pro-inflammatory response from macrophage in vitro. Uptake of
CPP by RAW 264.7 cells induced expression and release of TNF￾a and IL-1b in a dose-dependent manner. CPP uptake was also
found to induce cellular oxidative stress, as indicated by increased
8-iso-PGF2a production, and apoptosis at very high levels.
Importantly, these effects were not seen at low levels of CPP,
suggesting that these potentially harmful effects are only likely to
be encountered in extreme pathological states where CPP
synthesis is very high, or where chronic exposure has overwhelmed
clearance capacity. In support of such a role in health, we have
found that circulating serum CPP are undetectable by the current,
albeit fairly insensitive, and indirect methodology [30]. Thus, we
speculate that low-level physiological CPP production (if any)
might be protective, and unlikely to present a significant pro￾inflammatory insult.
Another major finding, was that CPP markedly attenuated the
effects on cytokine expression and cell viability compared to
hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals of similar size and calcium content.
This builds upon the original study by Terkeltaub et al [20], who
found that human fetuin-A specifically and strongly inhibited the
stimulatory effect of serum-coated HAP crystals on superoxide
release from neutrophils. Indeed, in the present study, iNOS
expression and 8-iso-PGF2a levels were significantly lower in CPP
compared to HAP-treated cells. Synthetic CPP were also found to
have a marginally greater stimulatory effect on macrophage than
serum-derived CPP at very high levels. The reason for this is not
clear, but may reflect the inhibitory activity of other serum
components variably present in serum CPP (e.g. fibrinogen,
fibronectin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, a 1-acid glycoprotein,
osteoprotegerin, bone morphogenetic protein 2) [20,29,30].
There is now a strong body of evidence to suggest that fetuin-A
is anti-inflammatory in most contexts, and has been shown to
reduce the inflammatory response to injury and a variety of toxic
stimuli in a number of animal models [43–48]. Here we provided
evidence that fetuin-A-coated mineral is less pro-inflammatory
than naked calcium phosphate nanocrystals, and is consistent with
the notion that calciprotein particle formation and clearance
represents an important humoral defense mechanism against the
potentially cytotoxic effects of nanocrystalline mineral [49].
Work in VSMC has demonstrated that cellular uptake of
calcium phosphate crystals results in a rapid rise in intracellular
calcium concentration (presumably as a result of crystal dissolu￾tion), leading to loss of membrane integrity and cell death [7]. Of
particular relevance to the present study, Ewence et al found that
BCP crystals pre-incubated in 1% FCS before addition to VSMC
was reported to have no significant effect on intracellular calcium
concentration, suggesting that the interaction of calcium phos￾phate crystals with serum components may attenuate their affect
on cell viability [7]. The precise intracellular mechanisms involved
here remain elusive, but we speculate that mineral coating by
fetuin-A may affect the dissolution kinetics of the calcium
phosphate core, and once internalized and acidified within the
phagolyosomal pathway, may give rise to a less pronounced spike
in intracellular calcium concentration. An alternative hypothesis, is
that fetuin-A (either free or that liberated from the mineral core)
may have a direct stabilizing effect on cell viability. With respect to
the apparent enhancement of macrophage survival, one possibility
Fetuin A Calciproteins in Macrophage
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60904

is that fetuin-A may block caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways.
Indeed, in cultured human aortic VSMC, fetuin-A was found to
reduce apoptotic events by inhibiting cleavage of caspases 3, 8 and
9 [50]. Since we found that free fetuin-A had no significant effect
on CPP uptake, a finding entirely consistent with that of
Herrmann et al who also found that free bovine fetuin-A had no
effect on synthetic CPP clearance by macrophage [23], we
conclude that the positive effect of fetuin-A on cell viability
appears to result from direct action within the cell. The
mechanistic details, however, of how fetuin-A might ameliorate
the pro-apoptoic effects of calcium phosphate crystal uptake have
yet to be fully elucidated.
Haglund et al demonstrated that 7–20% of the fetuin-A
circulating in plasma was phosphorylated, predominantly at
Ser312 and to a lesser extent at Ser120 [51]. Recent mass
spectrometry based studies of human phosphoproteome have
identified four other serine residues that may be partially
phosphorylated: Ser134, Ser138, Ser325, Ser334 [52,53]. With
respect to fetuin-A phosphorylation, we previously reported that
phospho-fetuin-A was the main fetuin-A species present in serum
CPP [30]. Relatedly, Matsui et al found only phosphorylated
fetuin-A in CPP harvested from the serum of rats with adenine￾induced renal failure [32]. However, the functional significance of
this protein modification remains obscure, as own data [30], in
addition to that of others [33], suggests that fetuin-A phosphor￾ylation is dispensable for CPP formation and does not enhance
calcification inhibitory potential. In the present study we found
that fetuin-A phosphorylation had little effect on CPP uptake, but
did have a significant effect on the nature of the downstream
intracellular response. Indeed, CPP synthesized using fully
dephosphorylated fetuin-A (dpFet-A) demonstrated only 50% of
the increase in TNF-a seen with CPP made with natively￾phosphorylated fetuin-A (npFet-A). This points to the possibility
that fetuin-A phosphorylation may serve as a ‘signal’ within the
cell. Further work is needed to explore the action, and fate, of
different fetuin-A phospho-isoforms once present within the
intracellular environment.
Extensive studies by Herrmann and colleagues recently
identified that the type I and type II class A scavenger-receptor
(SR-AI) was responsible for CPP clearance by phagocytic cells of
the reticuloendothelial system in the liver and spleen [23]. These
key findings are in agreement with an earlier study by Nagayama
et al, who found that fetuin-A mediated the clearance of negatively
charged nanoparticles by Kupffer cells also via scavenger receptors
[54]. SR-AI/II is a 220 kDa homotrimeric type II integral
membrane protein that is involved in the clearance of modified
phospholipoproteins (e.g. oxidized LDL, oxLDL) and other
oxidized self-antigens [55]. The SR-AI/II also plays a critical role
in the removal of various pathogens, apoptotic cell debris, and in
the regulation of macrophage cytokine production [55]. Intrigu￾ingly, we found that exposure of macrophages to high levels of
CPP up-regulated expression and protein levels of SR-AI/II. It is
possible that the apoptotic environment resulting from CPP
treatment may have led to upregulated SR-AI/II expression in the
remaining viable, potentially, CPP-resistant cells. However, there
are two lines of evidence which suggest that CPP may also have a
direct effect on SR-AI/II expression, rather than indirectly, as a
response to the apoptotic milieu. Firstly, increased SR-AI/II
expression was already detectable at CPP levels that did not induce
significant apoptosis compared to control treatment with vehicle
media alone; secondly, SR-AI protein levels were also elevated in
RAW 264.7 cells pre-treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor, z￾VAD-fmk, and exposed to growth media containing 60 mg/mL
CPP for 24 h. Speculatively, increased calcium influx and/or
ROS generation due to CPP uptake may induce a stress-response
via mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase
pathways leading to transactivation of SR-AI/II gene expression
by activator protein-1 [56,57]. Further work is needed to clarify
how CPP exposure induces SR-AI/II expression in the macro￾phage.
Irrespective of the exact mechanism, these findings would
suggest that high levels of CPP, or chronic exposure to CPP, as
typically seen in patients with CKD, would be expected to result in
increased SR-AI/II expression. Indeed, it is well established that
SR-AI/II expression is up-regulated by uraemic serum [58,59],
which if anything would be expected to result in enhanced
clearance of CPP. Why then, in CKD and dialysis patients, are
circulating CPP levels elevated compared to healthy controls? It
may be the case that clearance pathways become saturated when
chronically exposed to high levels of CPP and other competing
SR-AI/II ligands. Indeed, serum concentrations of oxLDL are
also generally elevated in patients with CKD [30,60]. In fact, in
our previous clinical study, serum oxLDL levels were strongly
correlated with CPP levels [30]. Given the common uptake
pathway it is perhaps unsurprising that the effects of excessive
oxLDL and CPP on macrophage appear similar [61]; increased
inflammatory cytokine production, increased nitric oxide biosyn￾thesis, up-regulation of SR-AI/II expression and increased cell
death. Finally, like oxLDL, CPP have been shown to accumulate
in atherosclerotic lesions [23]. Given the findings of the present
study, macrophage exposure to CPP may contribute to athero￾genesis and the cytotoxic effects of atheromatous ‘‘gruel’’ [40].
It is however worth highlighting that SR-AI inhibition, by
chemical or immunological means, did not entirely block CPP
uptake or CPP-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.
Indeed, in the study by Herrmann et al [23], CPP uptake was only
reduced by ,50% in macrophage derived from SR-AI/II￾deficient mice. Thus other clearance pathways may play a role
in CPP metabolism, particularly in disease states and when SR￾AI/II pathways become saturated.
Clinical Significance
In the context of uraemia, elevated CPP levels may represent a
response to mineral stress, but may also directly contribute to the
pathogenesis of vascular calcification. Inflammatory factors like
TNF-a and IL-1b have been shown to induce the de-differenti￾ation of contractile VSMC to a synthetic mineralizing phenotype,
which is considered a key event in the development of arterial
calcification [62]. Chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines has
also been shown to drive skeletal osteolysis [63], potentially
increasing the efflux of mineral from bone, theoretically,
increasing the production of CPP. Thus the induction and
elaboration of pro-inflammatory signals from macrophages that
we have observed with high levels of CPP, in vitro, may be expected
to exacerbate vascular calcification and bone demineralization.
Whether failure to remove CPP from the circulation leads to the
initiation or seeding of vascular mineralization, or whether CPP at
levels encountered in vivo can potentiate these effects, has yet to be
demonstrated. Animal models are now needed to translate these
findings to the in vivo situation, and to test ways in which to harness
this data therapeutically.
