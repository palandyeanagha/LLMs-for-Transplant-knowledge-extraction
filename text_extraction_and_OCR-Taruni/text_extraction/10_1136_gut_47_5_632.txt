Abstract
BACKGROUND AND AIMS The mechanism of gastrointestinal
damage (mucositis) induced by cancer chemotherapy remains
uncertain. The aims of this study were to define the time course and
mechanism of small intestinal damage following chemotherapy in
humans.
METHODS Patients receiving chemotherapy underwent upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy (a maximum of two per patient) with
duodenal biopsy prior to chemotherapy and again at 1, 3, 5, and 16
days after chemotherapy. Tissue was taken for morphometry,
disaccharidase assays, electron microscopy, and for assessment of
apoptosis using the Tdt mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling
(TUNEL) method. Villus area, crypt length, and mitotic index were
measured by a microdissection technique.
RESULTS Apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one
day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and
enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy.
Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy
showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3,
consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16
days.
CONCLUSION Small intestinal mucositis is associated with
apoptosis in crypts that precedes hypoplastic villous atrophy and
loss of enterocyte height.
