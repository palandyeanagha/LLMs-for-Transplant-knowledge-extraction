Dentate granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting is a common abnormality in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Mossy fiber
sprouting creates an aberrant positive-feedback network among granule cells that does not normally exist. Its role in epileptogenesis is
unclear and controversial. If it were possible to block mossy fiber sprouting from developing after epileptogenic treatments, its potential
role inthe pathogenesis of epilepsy could betested. Previous attemptsto block mossyfiber sprouting have been unsuccessful. The present
studytargetedthe mammaliantarget of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth and is blocked by rapamycin.
Rapamycin was focally, continuously, and unilaterally infused into the dorsal hippocampus for prolonged periods beginning within
hours after rats sustained pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Infusion for 1 month reduced aberrant Timm staining (a marker of
mossy fibers) in the granule cell layer and molecular layer. Infusion for 2 months inhibited mossy fiber sprouting more. However, after
rapamycin infusion ceased, aberrant Timm staining developed and approached untreated levels. When onset of infusion began after
mossy fiber sprouting had developed for 2 months, rapamycin did not reverse aberrant Timm staining. These findings suggest that
inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway suppressed development of mossy fiber sprouting. However, suppression required continual
treatment, and rapamycin treatment did not reverse already established axon reorganization.
Introduction
Temporal lobe epilepsy is common and difficult to treat, and its
pathogenesis remains unclear (Engel et al., 1997). Aberrant
sprouting of granule cell axons (mossy fibers) is evident in the
dentate gyrus of many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (de
Lanerolle et al., 1989; Sutula et al., 1989; Houser et al., 1990; Babb
et al., 1991) and in different laboratory animal models of epilepsy
(Nadler et al., 1980; Sutula et al., 1988; Mello et al., 1993; Qiao
and Noebels, 1993; Ribak et al., 1998; Nissinen et al., 2000;
Kharatishvili et al., 2006; Kadam and Dudek, 2007). The role of
mossy fiber sprouting in generation of spontaneous seizures is
controversial. It has been proposed as a compensatory mecha￾nism that restores excitatory synaptic input to inhibitory inter￾neurons (Sloviter, 1992; Sloviter et al., 2006). However, sprouted
mossy fibers predominantly synapse with granule cells (Buck￾master et al., 2002), resulting in a positive-feedback circuit
(Lynch and Sutula, 2000; Scharfman et al., 2003) that may reduce
seizure threshold (Tauck and Nadler, 1985; Wuarin and Dudek,
1996). It would be useful experimentally, and perhaps therapeu￾tically, to selectively block mossy fiber sprouting after epilepto￾genic injuries. Prior attempts neutralized nerve growth factor
with antibodies (Holtzman and Lowenstein, 1995), inhibited
neural activity with tetrodotoxin (Buckmaster, 2004b), blocked
protein synthesis with cycloheximide around the time of epilep￾togenic injury (Williams et al., 2002; Toyoda and Buckmaster,
2005), and targeted growth cone function by inhibiting cal￾cineurin with cyclosporin A and FK506 or L-type calcium chan￾nels with nicardipine (Ingram et al., 2009), but none prevented
mossy fiber sprouting (cf. Moriwaki et al., 1996; Longo and
Mello, 1997, 1998; Ikegaya, 1999; Ikegaya et al., 2000).
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionarily
conserved serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in con￾trol of cell growth (Schmelzle and Hall, 2000). It is expressed in
many tissues, including brain (Kim et al., 2002), where its activa￾tion is controlled by a variety of extracellular signals, including
glutamate (Cammalleri et al., 2003; Hou and Klann, 2004; Gong
et al., 2006) and BDNF (Takei et al., 2004). The mTOR signaling
pathway has been reviewed (Harris and Lawrence, 2003; Swiech
et al., 2008). Briefly, ligands bind receptors and activate phospho￾inositide 3-kinase, which activates the protein kinase Akt, which
modulates activity of proteins involved in tuberous sclerosis
(TSC1 and TSC2) and the small guanosine triphosphatase, Rheb,
which is immediately upstream of mTOR. mTOR, when coupled
with other proteins, inhibits 4EBP1, which is a translation repres￾sor. mTOR also activates S6K-1, which phosphorylates ribosomal
protein S6, resulting in increased translation.
Rapamycin specifically inhibits mTOR (Sabatini et al., 1994).
Rapamycin is anticonvulsant in phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN)-deficient mice (Kwon et al., 2003) and antiepileptogenic

in a rodent model of tuberous sclerosis
(Zeng et al., 2008). Traumatic brain injury
activates the mTOR signaling pathway
(Chen et al., 2007) and can cause mossy
fiber sprouting and epilepsy (Kharatishvili
et al., 2006). Thus, previous studies suggest
that mossy fiber sprouting may result, in
part, from activation of the mTOR signal￾ing pathway. In some neuronal types,
rapamycin inhibits regeneration (Verma
et al., 2005; Park et al., 2008) and guidance
of axonal growth cones (Campbell and
Holt, 2001). The present study addressed
the following questions. Is the mTOR
pathway activated when mossy fiber
sprouting occurs after status epilepticus?
Does prolonged, continuous, focal infu￾sion of rapamycin suppress development
of mossy fiber sprouting? If so, does mossy
fiber sprouting remain suppressed after
rapamycin treatment ceases? And does
rapamycin infusion reverse previously es￾tablished mossy fiber sprouting?
Materials and Methods
All experiments were approved by the Stanford
University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and performed in accordance with
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. Pilocarpine
treatment was performed as described previ￾ously (Buckmaster, 2004a). Briefly, male
Sprague Dawley rats (34  1 d old; range 27–
45) were treated with atropine methylbromide
(5 mg/kg, i.p.), then 20 min later with pilo￾carpine hydrochloride (380 mg/kg, i.p.) to in￾duce status epilepticus. All chemicals were from
Sigma-Aldrich unless specified otherwise. After
2 h of status epilepticus, convulsions were sup￾pressed with diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p., repeated
as needed; Hospira), and lactated Ringer’s solu￾tion was administered subcutaneously. All rats
in this study experienced at least 2 h of status
epilepticus.
Osmotic pumps and cannulae were implanted to focally and continu￾ously deliver rapamycin (Alexis Biochemicals or LC Laboratories) to the
dorsal, left dentate gyrus. Rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane
(Baxter). Body temperature was monitored and controlled with a heating
pad with feedback control. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus,
and their head and dorsal neck were prepared for aseptic surgery. A scalp
incision was made, and a 1-mm-diameter hole was drilled through the
skull, 4.6 mm caudal and 2.8 mm left of bregma. A 3.5-mm-long 28 gauge
cannula (Alzet brain infusion kit II; Durect Corporation) was inserted
and secured to the skull with cranioplastic cement and a jeweler’s screw.
An osmotic pump (model 2004; Durect Corporation) and tubing leading
to the cannula were implanted subcutaneously over the back. The man￾ufacturer’s specifications indicate that at body temperature (37°C),
model 2004 pumps deliver 0.25  0.05 l/h for at least 28 d. Pumps
contained vehicle solution consisting of 50% DMSO, 15% ethanol, and
0.1% fluorescein (Invitrogen) with or without rapamycin (0.01–10 mM).
In most experiments, infusions began 1– 8 h after administering the first
dose of diazepam, which was 2 h after onset of status epilepticus. In one
experiment, surgery and rapamycin infusion was delayed until 2 months
after status epilepticus. Rapamycin was infused for 1 or 2 months. For
2-month-long infusions, pumps were replaced after 1 month. In most
experiments, rats were perfused immediately after 1- or 2-month-long
infusions. In one experiment, perfusion was delayed until 2 months after
rapamycin infusion ceased.
Rats were perfused and hippocampi sectioned and processed as de￾scribed previously (Buckmaster, 2004b). Briefly, rats were killed by ure￾thane overdose (2 g/kg, i.p.), perfused through the ascending aorta at 30
ml/min for 2 min with 0.9% sodium chloride, 5 min with 0.37% sodium
sulfide, 1 min with 0.9% sodium chloride, and 30 min with 4% parafor￾maldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Brains postfixed
overnight at 4°C. Then, both hippocampi were isolated, cryoprotected in
30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB, gently straightened, frozen, and sectioned trans￾versely with a microtome set at 30 m. Starting at a random point near
the septal pole, a 1-in-6 series of sections from each hippocampus was
mounted, dried, and developed for 45 min in 120 ml of 50% gum arabic,
20 ml of 2 M citrate buffer, 60 ml of 0.5 M hydroquinone, and 1 ml of 19%
silver nitrate. Infused and contralateral noninfused hippocampi from the
same animal developed together. An adjacent 1-in-6 series of sections
was processed for Nissl staining with 0.25% thionin. A third 1-in-6 series
was mounted, dried, coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laborato￾ries), and checked for fluorescein labeling to verify delivery of pump
contents in infused hippocampi.
Mossy fiber sprouting was measured as described previously (Buck￾master and Dudek, 1997; Buckmaster, 2004b). Briefly, sections were an￾alyzed using a light microscope equipped with a 10 objective, Lucivid,

and Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience). An investigator blind to the
rats’ treatment made contours around the granule cell layer  molecular
layer and the Timm-positive parts of the granule cell layer  molecular
layer. Figure 1 illustrates a typical example of contours drawn on a
Timm-stained section of dentate gyrus. Density of Timm staining within
Timm-positive contours was measured using identical camera and mi￾croscope settings for all samples. Brightness was measured and expressed
on an optical density scale from 0 to 1, in which 0 was the minimal density
value when no tissue was in the light path, and 1 was the maximal density
value when the microscope light source was turned off. Extent of mossy
fiber sprouting varies among individual rats treated systemically with
chemoconvulsants (Buckmaster and Dudek, 1997). To avoid this poten￾tial confound, the contralateral noninfused hippocampus served as a
control in each rat.
To measure activation of the mTOR pathway, ribosomal protein S6
was evaluated, which is a downstream phosphorylation target of the
mTOR signaling pathway (Chung et al., 1992). In an experiment to mea￾sure mTOR activity after status epilepticus, male Sprague Dawley rats (41
d old) were vehicle or pilocarpine treated, as described above. Tissue was
collected for Western blot analysis 24 h or 7 d later. Control groups
consisted of vehicle-treated rats (n  5) and pilocarpine-treated rats that
did not develop status epilepticus (n  6). Control tissue was collected
24 h after treatment. Tissue was collected from pilocarpine-treated rats
that experienced status epilepticus 24 h (n  6) or 7 d previously (n  6).
To collect tissue, rats were killed by urethane overdose (2 g/kg, i.p.) and
decapitated. Brains were quickly removed from the skull, and both hip￾pocampi were immediately isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen and
preserved at 80°C. Tissue samples (25 mg) were homogenized at 4°C in
150 l of lysis buffer consisting of 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS,
10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, and 0.01% bromophenol blue. Samples were
sonicated for 15 s, and aliquots were stored at 80°C. Expression levels of
total ribosomal protein S6 and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6
were measured by Western blotting. Isolated protein samples were
heated to 95–100°C for 5 min, chilled on ice, and centrifuged. Isolated
proteins (3 l, 35 g) were diluted and loaded on 4 –20% SDS￾polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 20 mA/gel for 110 min, be￾fore being transferred onto pure nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher
and Schuell Bioscience) at 200 mA for 108 min. Blotted nitrocellulose
membranes were blocked with freshly prepared Tris-buffered saline with
0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, then incu￾bated in rabbit anti-phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236) serum
(1:900; Cell Signaling Technology) in TBS/T containing 5% bovine se￾rum albumin overnight with agitation at 4°C. After a wash, nitrocellulose
membranes incubated in anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked con￾jugate (1:5000; GE Healthcare) in TBS/T for 50 min at room temperature
with agitation. Nitrocellulose membranes then were washed with TBS/T.
ECL Western blotting detection reagents and autoradiography film (GE
Healthcare) were used to detect bands. After completing analysis of
phospho-S6 bands, blotted nitrocellulose membranes were washed in
Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce Biotechnology) for 15 min
at room temperature and incubated with anti-total ribosomal protein S6
serum (1:2500; 5G10, Cell Signaling Technology) using methods de￾scribed above. Phosphorylated S6 and total S6 levels were quantified by
densitometry using NIH Image software. Ratiometric data for each ani￾mal, consisting of duplicate sample tubes, were averaged together.
In an experiment to test the effect of rapamycin infusion on mTOR
activity in the hippocampus close to the infusion site, six naive male
Sprague Dawley rats (35 d old) were implanted for rapamycin infusion as
described above. After 14 d of infusion, rats were killed by urethane

were quickly removed from the skull, placed in

Results
Status epilepticus activates the
mTOR pathway
To test whether status epilepticus activated
the mTOR signaling pathway in hip￾pocampus, a downstream target of the
pathway was evaluated. S6K-1, which is
phosphorylated and activated by mTOR,
in turn, phosphorylates ribosomal protein
S6 (Chung et al., 1992), which is a com￾monly used readout of mTOR activity
(Kwon et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2007;
Meikle et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008; Zeng
et al., 2008). Hippocampal tissue was eval￾uated in rats 24 h (n  6) and 7 d (n  6)
after pilocarpine-induced status epilepti￾cus. Control groups consisted of vehicle￾treated rats (n  5) and pilocarpine￾treated rats that did not develop status
epilepticus (n  6). Western blot analysis
was used to measure ratios of phospho-S6
to total S6 (Fig. 2). Results from the two
control groups were similar (0.28  0.04
vs 0.30  0.11 for vehicle- and
pilocarpine-treated controls, respectively,
p  0.62, t test), so they were combined. At
24 h and 7 d after status epilepticus, aver￾age phospho-S6-to-total-S6 ratios were
greater than twice control values ( p 
0.05, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA on ranks).
These findings suggest that status epilepti￾cus activates the mTOR signaling pathway.
Rapamycin infusion inhibited the
mTOR signaling pathway
in hippocampus
Osmotic pumps continuously delivered
rapamycin to a focal region of the left, dor￾sal dentate gyrus, which was compared
with the contralateral noninfused region.
Vehicle contained fluorescein, and sec￾tions were examined to verify fluorescence
in infused hippocampi. Fluorescence was
clearly evident in sections near sites of in￾fusion, but not in corresponding sections
from contralateral hippocampi (Fig. 3). In three rats, fluores￾cence was not observed, and they were excluded from analysis.
These findings suggest that in all rats included in this study,
pumps delivered their contents, which was concentrated in the
infused but not contralateral dentate gyrus.
Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway would be expected
to reduce levels of phospho-S6. Using the same rapamycin￾infusion methods as used for experiments in which Timm stain￾ing was measured, six rats were treated with 10 mM rapamycin for
14 d. Subjects were naive, not pilocarpine treated, but we expect
both groups to respond similarly. Hippocampal tissue (3 mm

thick, anterior–posterior) was isolated, which included dentate
gyrus, CA3, CA1, and subiculum and contained the infusion site.
The same region was isolated from contralateral hippocampi.
Western blot analysis was used to measure ratios of phospho-S6
to total S6 in infused and contralateral noninfused hippocampi
(Fig. 2). Ratios of phospho-S6 to total S6 were lower in infused
versus contralateral hippocampi in all individual animals. Group
averages were significantly different (0.58  0.05 vs 0.92  0.09,
p  0.004, paired t test). These findings suggest that the rapamy￾cin treatment protocol used in this study partially suppressed the
mTOR pathway in hippocampi near infusion sites.
Extent of inhibition is likely to be greatest near sites of infu￾sion, where rapamycin concentration is likely to be highest with
this delivery method (Sendelbeck and Urquhart, 1985). In the
present Western blot analysis, samples included all parts of hip￾pocampus, not just dentate gyrus, and 3-mm-thick sections were
collected to provide sufficient material for analysis. This sam￾pling method may have diluted focal rapamycin-infusion effects.
Results, therefore, may underestimate inhibition of the mTOR
pathway in regions closest to infusion sites.
Rapamycin infusion for 1 month suppressed mossy
fiber sprouting
Mossy fiber sprouting develops gradually over a period of weeks
to months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Mello et
al., 1993). By 1 month after status epilepticus, mossy fiber sprout￾ing is developed to a sufficient baseline level for quantitative anal￾ysis (Buckmaster, 2004b). In eight rats, 10 mM rapamycin was
infused continuously and focally into the left, dorsal dentate gy￾rus for 1 month after status epilepticus. Extent of aberrant Timm
staining was measured as the percentage of the area of the granule
cell layer  molecular layer that was Timm positive. In sections
200 m along the septotemporal axis from the infusion site,
percentage of the granule cell layer  molecular layer that was
Timm positive was less than that of the corresponding region in
contralateral noninfused hippocampi (Fig. 4). Inhibition of ab￾errant Timm staining appeared maximal closest to infusion sites.
In each animal, extent of aberrant Timm staining was calculated
by averaging values of the three sections closest to infusion sites
and the corresponding three sections in the contralateral nonin￾fused hippocampus. In all rats, hippocampi infused with 10 mM
rapamycin for 1 month displayed less aberrant Timm staining
than contralateral noninfused hippocampi. Group averages were
significantly different (22.7  2.1 vs 27.2  1.9%, p  0.001,
paired t test).
To test whether suppression of aberrant Timm staining was
specific to rapamycin, a range of concentrations was tested. Iden￾tical infusion methods were used to test 1 mM rapamycin (n  4),
0.1 mM (n  3), 0.01 mM (n  4), and vehicle alone (n  6). In
each animal, average percentage of the granule cell layer  mo￾lecular layer that was Timm positive was calculated for infused
and contralateral hippocampi, as described above. Then, the dif￾ference was calculated by subtracting the average value of the
contralateral hippocampus from the average of the infused hip￾pocampus. Accordingly, negative values indicate reduced aber￾rant Timm staining in infused hippocampi. Group averages for
10 mM,1mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM, and vehicle alone were 6.5 
1.2, 7.5  1.2, 8.8  1.1, 2.5  0.8, and 0.3  1.9%, respec￾tively. ANOVA revealed a significant difference between groups
( p  0.001). Pairwise multiple comparisons revealed signifi￾cantly less aberrant Timm staining in hippocampi infused with
10, 1, or 0.1 mM rapamycin (no significant differences between
these three groups) compared with 0.01 or 0 mM rapamycin (no
significant differences between these two groups) ( p  0.05,
Bonferroni t test). These findings suggest that infusion of rapa￾mycin, but not vehicle alone, suppresses mossy fiber sprouting.
Rapamycin infusion for 2 months suppressed mossy fiber
sprouting more
Development of mossy fiber sprouting is incomplete 1 month
after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Mello et al., 1993).
To test whether longer treatment would further suppress mossy
fiber sprouting, three rats were infused with 10 mM rapamycin for
2 months (Fig. 5). Infusion methods were identical to those de￾scribed above, except that osmotic pumps were replaced after 1
month, which is the limit of their delivery duration. All rats dis￾played less aberrant Timm staining in infused than in contralat￾eral noninfused hippocampi. The average difference in percent￾age of the granule cell layer  molecular layer that was Timm
positive (infused  contralateral) was 11.8  1.6%, which was
greater than the average difference after only 1 month infusion
with 10 mM rapamycin (6.5  1.2%, p  0.04, unpaired t test).
These findings suggest that longer treatment with rapamycin
suppressed mossy fiber sprouting more.
Suppression of mossy fiber sprouting diminished after
rapamycin infusion stopped
To test whether rapamycin infusion permanently suppressed
mossy fiber sprouting, four rats were infused with 10 mM rapa￾mycin for 2 months and then survived 2 more months after pump
removal. Infusion methods were identical to those described
above, except that pumps were removed and tubing sealed after 2
months of infusion, and rats were perfused 2 months later. In￾tense, diffuse fluorescence was not evident as it was in rats per￾fused immediately after infusion. Instead, moderate levels of par￾ticulate fluorescence were observed in all rats (data not shown).
These findings suggest that fluorescein had been delivered and
largely but incompletely cleared over the 2 months after pump
removal. The average percentage of the granule cell layer  mo￾lecular layer that was Timm positive in sections within 200 m
of infusion sites was similar to that in contralateral noninfused
hippocampi (30.5  2.5 vs 32.2  1.7%, respectively, p  0.42,
paired t test) (Fig. 5). The average difference in percentage of the
granule cell layer  molecular layer that was Timm positive (in￾fused  contralateral) in rats that survived 2 months beyond a 2
month period of 10 mM rapamycin infusion was significantly less
than that of rats perfused immediately after 2 months infusion
with 10 mM rapamycin (1.7  1.8 vs 11.8  1.6%, respec￾tively, p  0.01, unpaired t test). These findings suggest that
suppression of mossy fiber sprouting by rapamycin is not perma￾nent and instead may require continuous treatment.
Rapamycin infusion did not reverse established mossy
fiber sprouting
To test whether rapamycin could reverse mossy fiber sprouting
after it had developed, infusion began 2 months after status epi￾lepticus and lasted 1 month (n  6). The average percentage of
the granule cell layer  molecular layer that was Timm positive in
sections within 200 m of infusion sites was similar to that in
contralateral noninfused hippocampi (29.2  2.5 vs 29.7  2.5%,
respectively, p  0.72, paired t test) (Fig. 6). The average differ￾ence in percentage of the granule cell layer  molecular layer that
was Timm positive (infused  contralateral) in rats treated for 1
month with 10 mM rapamycin after a latency of 2 months was
significantly less than that of rats treated beginning immediately
after status epilepticus (0.3  0.9 vs 6.5  1.2%, respectively,

p  0.002, unpaired t test). These findings
suggest that rapamycin infusion did not
reverse mossy fiber sprouting after it had
developed.
Rapamycin infusion did not prevent
status epilepticus-induced hilar
neuron loss
Extent of aberrant Timm staining corre￾lates with extent of hilar neuron loss (Babb
et al., 1991; Masukawa et al., 1996; Buck￾master and Dudek, 1997; Nissinen et al.,
2001; Jiao and Nadler, 2007), and rapamy￾cin has neuroprotective effects (Alirezaei
et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008). These find￾ings raise the possibility that rapamycin
might have protected hilar neurons from
status epilepticus-induced excitotoxicity
and thereby indirectly reduced mossy fiber
sprouting. To avoid this potential con￾founding factor, rapamycin infusion did
not begin until at least 1 h after suppres￾sion of status epilepticus with diazepam.
Nevertheless, to test whether hilar neurons
were spared in rapamycin-infused hip￾pocampi, numbers of hilar neuron profiles
were counted in the three sections closest
to infusion sites and corresponding three
sections in contralateral noninfused hip￾pocampi. Average values from each hip￾pocampus were calculated. Then, averages
for experimental groups were calculated
(Fig. 7). Average numbers of hilar neuron
profiles were slightly and consistently
lower in infused versus contralateral non￾infused hippocampi (ANOVA, p  0.006).
The effect was apparent in all experimental
groups, including those infused with only
0.01 mM rapamycin or vehicle alone. These
findings suggest that hilar neuron loss was
slightly more severe in infused hip￾pocampi, regardless of whether rapamycin
was present. Perhaps surgical implanta￾tion of cannulae contributed to hilar neu￾ron loss. These findings also suggest that
rapamycin infusion did not prevent status
epilepticus-induced hilar neuron loss.
Therefore, suppression of mossy fiber
sprouting is not likely attributable to a sec￾ondary effect on hilar neuron survival.
Another potential confound is density
of aberrant Timm staining. To test
whether intensities of Timm staining in
the granule cell layer  molecular layer
were different in infused versus nonin￾fused contralateral hippocampi, optical
densities within Timm-positive contours
were measured (Fig. 8). Densities of aber￾rant Timm staining were similar within
outlined areas of infused versus nonin￾fused contralateral hippocampi (ANOVA,
p  0.4), including groups infused with
maximal doses of rapamycin and maximal

durations. These findings suggest that reduced areas of aberrant
Timm staining in rapamycin-infused hippocampi were not com￾pensated by more intense sprouting.
Discussion
The principal findings of the present study are the following.
Prolonged, continuous, focal infusion of rapamycin suppressed
development of aberrant mossy fiber
sprouting in a rat model of temporal lobe
epilepsy. Longer infusions suppressed
sprouting more. Sprouting that had been
suppressed initially with rapamycin devel￾oped after infusion ceased, and rapamycin
failed to reverse established sprouting.
These findings suggest that the mTOR sig￾naling pathway may be a useful target for
reducing granule cell axon reorganization
after epileptogenic injuries.
Status epilepticus activates the
mTOR pathway
Pilocarpine was used to cause status epi￾lepticus, which resulted in development of
mossy fiber sprouting. Oxotremorine, an￾other muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
agonist, acutely increases phosphorylation
of S6-kinase, and to a lesser extent mTOR,
in hippocampus, but levels return to base￾line by 16 h (Deguil et al., 2008). In the
present study, there was no significant dif￾ference in levels of phosphorylated S6 in
pilocarpine- versus vehicle-treated con￾trols 24 h after treatment. On the other
hand, pilocarpine-treated rats that experi￾enced status epilepticus displayed signifi￾cantly elevated levels of phosphorylated S6
24 h and 7 d after treatment. These find￾ings suggest that the mTOR signaling
pathway is activated by status epilepticus,
but not by pilocarpine alone, during the
period when mossy fibers sprout. Simi￾larly, traumatic brain injury activates the
mTOR pathway (Chen et al., 2007) and
can cause mossy fiber sprouting (Golarai
et al., 2001; Kharatishvili et al., 2006).
Rapamycin suppressed mossy
fiber sprouting
In the present study, granule cell axon ter￾minals were identified by black Timm
staining. The Timm staining protocol gen￾erates opaque silver particles at sites at
which heavy metals are concentrated
(Haug, 1967). The Timm stain is a specific
marker for granule cell axons because
mossy fibers concentrate zinc in synaptic
vesicles (Wenzel et al., 1997). Did rapamy￾cin artifactually interfere with Timm
staining instead of suppressing mossy fiber
sprouting? This is unlikely, because Timm
staining was reduced specifically in regions
of sprouting, not in adjacent areas, includ￾ing hilus and stratum lucidum of CA3.
Furthermore, when infusion was delayed
until after mossy fiber sprouting developed, Timm staining in the
granule cell layer and molecular layer was intense, despite rapa￾mycin treatment. In the present study, mossy fiber sprouting was
quantified by drawing contours around Timm-positive areas
within the granule cell layer  molecular layer. Timm-positive
areas consist of many small, black spots, and defining borders of

those areas can be subjective. To avoid bias, investigators were
blind to experimental groups. Similar optical densities within
Timm-positive regions of infused versus contralateral hip￾pocampi in each experimental group support the validity of com￾paring relative areas of Timm-positive regions within the granule
cell layer and molecular layer.
Suppression of mossy fiber sprouting appeared to be specific
to rapamycin treatment. Sprouting occurred at untreated levels
when vehicle or low-dose rapamycin was infused and was sup￾pressed by higher doses. Rapamycin is a specific inhibitor of
mTOR complex 1 (Loewith et al., 2002), which is part of a signal￾ing pathway that phosphorylates and activates ribosomal protein
S6 (Chung et al., 1992). Reduced phospho-S6 levels after infusion
of 10 mM rapamycin are consistent with inhibition of mTOR
complex 1. Prolonged rapamycin treatment can sequester mTOR
and indirectly inhibit mTOR complex 2 (Sarbassov et al., 2006),
which is part of another signaling pathway that controls cell pro￾liferation and survival through the actin cytoskeleton and Akt/
PKB (Jacinto et al., 2004). The present study cannot distinguish
between rapamycin’s effects on mTOR complex 1 and its effects
on mTOR complex 2. Despite mTOR’s role in cell survival, rapa￾mycin infusion did not spare hilar neurons from excitotoxicity in
the present study, probably because infusion began after rats had
experienced status epilepticus.
Hilar neuron loss was slightly more severe in infused than in
noninfused hippocampi. However, the effect was not specific to
rapamycin. All groups displayed the difference, even those in￾fused with little or no rapamycin. Slightly more severe hilar neu￾ron loss in infused hippocampi might be attributable to surgical
placement of cannulae. Nevertheless, rapamycin’s suppression of
mossy fiber sprouting was not attributable to hilar neuron
survival.
Rapamycin binds FK506 binding protein 12 (Heitman et al.,
1991), which is part of yet another signaling pathway that affects
activity of calcineurin, a calcium-activated phosphatase that has
been proposed to play a role in mossy fiber sprouting (Moriwaki
et al., 1996). However, this mechanism is unlikely to account for
rapamycin’s effect, because infusion of FK506, an inhibitor of
calcineurin, fails to suppress mossy fiber sprouting (Ingram et al.,
2009). Rapamycin impairs potentiation of excitatory synapses
(Casadio et al., 1999; Tang et al., 2002) and can reduce network
excitability (Ru¨egg et al., 2007), suggesting that it might have
suppressed mossy fiber sprouting indirectly by affecting excit￾ability or synapse strength. This possibility seems unlikely, how￾ever, because prolonged infusion of the sodium channel blocker

tetrodotoxin, which reduces neuronal activity substantially (Gal￾van et al., 2000), fails to suppress mossy fiber sprouting (Buck￾master, 2004b).
Findings of the present study suggest that rapamycin sup￾pressed development of mossy fiber sprouting in a rodent model
of temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings also suggest that target￾ing the mTOR signaling pathway may be useful for testing the
role of mossy fiber sprouting on epileptogenesis. However, rapa￾mycin also impairs long-term potentiation (Casadio et al., 1999;
Tang et al., 2002) and learning (Dash et al., 2006; Parsons et al.,
2006), alters neuronal expression of transporters (Li et al., 2006),
voltage-gated channels (Raab-Graham et al., 2006), and ligand￾gated channels (Sabatini et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2006), inhibits
dendritic growth (Jaworski et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2005; Huang
et al., 2007), and changes dendritic spine morphology (Tavazoie
et al., 2005). Therefore, the mTOR signaling pathway’s effects on
epileptogenesis and seizure threshold may be complex.
Mossy fiber sprouting may be permanent once established
The hypothesis that rapamycin might reverse already established
mossy fiber sprouting was motivated by a report that mTOR
inhibition reverses dentate granule cell hypertrophy in adult
PTEN-deficient mice (Kwon et al., 2003). However, in the
present study, 1 month treatment with rapamycin was insuffi￾cient to significantly reduce already established aberrant Timm
staining. Although these findings do not exclude the possibility
that longer treatments may have been more effective, they suggest
that mossy fiber sprouting may be irreversible. Similarly, in ro￾dent models of tuberous sclerosis, rapamycin administered after
completion of neuronal differentiation failed to reverse abnor￾mally oriented neocortical dendrites (Meikle et al., 2008), and
beneficial effects of rapamycin, including reduced seizure fre￾quency and increased survival, require continued long-term
treatment and reverse after treatment stops (Zeng et al., 2008). In
PTEN-deficient mice, dentate granule cell hypertrophy resumes
after mTOR inhibition stops (Kwon et al., 2003). These results are
not surprising, because genetic disease models involve mutations
that persist after rapamycin treatment ends. In the present study,
continuous rapamycin treatment was required, which suggests
that signals that promote mossy fiber sprouting may be persistent
and, unfortunately, not transiently expressed only during a crit￾ical window during which time targeted, temporary treatment
could permanently block axon reorganization.
Mossy fiber sprouting is resilient
Mossy fiber sprouting is a common abnormality in patients, oc￾curs in many laboratory animal models of epilepsy, and has re￾sisted previous attempts to suppress it (see Introduction). In the
present study, mossy fiber sprouting was reduced but not blocked
entirely by rapamycin, even at high concentrations. These find￾ings suggest redundancy in signaling pathways, such that inhibi￾tion of a single important node may partially suppress but not
abrogate axon sprouting (Bromberg et al., 2008). More complete
blockade of mossy fiber sprouting may require targeting addi￾tional steps in the mTOR cascade and in other signaling
pathways.
