Abstract
BACKGROUND The bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)
remains the major constraint on the long term success of lung
transplantation. Neutrophils have been associated with fibrosing
lung conditions and have been noted to be increased in the
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with BOS.
METHODS This study was undertaken to examine neutrophil
accumulation in the BAL fluid, airway wall and lung parenchyma,
as well as levels of interleukin (IL)-8 in the BAL fluid, in normal
controls and lung transplant recipients with and without BOS.
Bronchoscopic examination included endobronchial biopsy (EBB),
BAL fluid, and transbronchial biopsy (TBB) sampling. Tissue
neutrophils were identified by neutrophil elastase staining on 3 μm
paraffin biopsy sections and quantified by computerised image
analyser. IL-8 levels were measured in unconcentrated BAL fluid by
ELISA.
RESULTS Compared with controls, airway wall neutrophilia was
increased in both stable lung transplant recipients and those with
BOS (p<0.05). BAL neutrophils and IL-8 levels were also increased
in both groups of transplant recipients compared with controls
(p<0.01), the levels being significantly higher in the BOS group
(p<0.01). Neutrophil numbers in the lung parenchyma were not
significantly different between the two groups of lung transplant
recipients.
CONCLUSION Increased levels of neutrophils are present in the
airway wall and BAL fluid of lung transplant recipients with and
without BOS. BAL fluid levels of IL-8 are also increased, raising the
possibility that neutrophils and/or IL-8 may play a part in the
pathogenesis of BOS following lung transplantation.
