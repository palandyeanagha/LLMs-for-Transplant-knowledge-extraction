Abstract
Viruses within a family often vary in their cellular tropism and pathogenicity. In many cases, these variations are due to
viruses switching their specificity from one cell surface receptor to another. The structural requirements that underlie such
receptor switching are not well understood especially for carbohydrate-binding viruses, as methods capable of structure￾specificity studies are only relatively recently being developed for carbohydrates. We have characterized the receptor
specificity, structure and infectivity of the human polyomavirus BKPyV, the causative agent of polyomavirus-associated
nephropathy, and uncover a molecular switch for binding different carbohydrate receptors. We show that the b-series
gangliosides GD3, GD2, GD1b and GT1b all can serve as receptors for BKPyV. The crystal structure of the BKPyV capsid
protein VP1 in complex with GD3 reveals contacts with two sialic acid moieties in the receptor, providing a basis for the
observed specificity. Comparison with the structure of simian virus 40 (SV40) VP1 bound to ganglioside GM1 identifies the
amino acid at position 68 as a determinant of specificity. Mutation of this residue from lysine in BKPyV to serine in SV40
switches the receptor specificity of BKPyV from GD3 to GM1 both in vitro and in cell culture. Our findings highlight the
plasticity of viral receptor binding sites and form a template to retarget viruses to different receptors and cell types.

Introduction
Interactions of a virus with receptors on host cells are crucial for
viral entry and infection, and determine host range and tissue
tropism of the virus. As a result, receptor specificity and affinity are
tightly regulated, with changes in either producing a virus with
different spread and infectivity. Many zoonotic transmissions are
based on a virus acquiring binding capability for a new receptor.
Despite their importance, most viral specificity switches are poorly
characterized, especially for carbohydrate-binding viruses, as
methods capable of structure-specificity studies are only being
developed for carbohydrates. Here we characterize the receptor
specificity of the human BK Polyomavirus in depth, and retarget it
to use the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) receptor GM1.
The human polyomavirus BK Virus (BKPyV) is a non￾enveloped, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that belongs to
the family Polyomaviridae. Other members of the family include
Simian Virus 40 (SV40), the human JC Virus (JCPyV), Merkel
Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) and at least eight other recently
discovered human polyomaviruses [1]. BKPyV was first isolated
from a kidney transplant recipient in 1971 [2]. It establishes a
persistent asymptomatic infection in the genitourinary tract of
approximately 70% of the adult population [3,4,5]. A key
modulator of BKPyV reactivation is immunosuppression of the
host that leads to an increase in viral replication [3]. Complica￾tions of BKPyV reactivation include the development of poly￾omavirus-induced nephropathy (PVN) in kidney transplant

Author Summary
Viruses need to bind to receptors on host cells for viral
entry and infection, and the type of receptor bound
determines the range of hosts and tissues the virus can
infect. Viruses within a family often vary in their tissue
distribution and pathogenicity because changes in recep￾tor specificity can produce a virus with different spread
and infectivity. In fact, many transmissions between
species are based on a virus acquiring binding capability
for a new receptor. The structural changes that underlie
such receptor switching are not well understood. We have
analyzed the structural requirements for receptor binding
and switching of the human BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), the
causative agent of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy.
We show that BKPyV uses specific gangliosides that all
contain a common a2,8-disialic acid motif to infect cells,
and have characterized the interaction in atomic detail.
Our data explains the requirement for this disialic acid
motif and in particular highlights a single amino acid that
is central to determining specificity. Mutation of this
residue switches the receptor specificity, enabling BKPyV
to infect cells bearing a different class of gangliosides. Our
findings highlight the plasticity of viral receptor binding
sites and form a template to retarget viruses to different
receptors and cell types.

recipients, and hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant
recipients [3,6,7].
BKPyV attachment is mediated by cell-surface sialic acid [8].
The most common sialic acid type in humans is 5-N-acetyl
neuraminic acid (NeuNAc) [9]. Simians and most other mammals,
however, possess an enzyme that can attach an additional
hydroxyl group to NeuNAc, yielding 5-N-glycolyl neuraminic acid
(NeuNGc). In contrast to humans, these animals therefore carry
both NeuNAc and NeuNGc. Gangliosides were found to mediate
cell attachment of BKPyV [10], and gangliosides GD1b and
GT1b were later shown to function as specific receptors for
BKPyV [11] (Fig. 1). Gangliosides are ceramide-based glycolipids,
which are used as receptors for most of the well-characterized
polyomaviruses, for example GD1a and GT1b for Polyoma, or
GM1 for SV40 [12].
A polyomavirus capsid consists of 72 pentamers of the major
capsid protein VP1 [13,14]. Crystal structures of Polyoma, SV40,
MCPyV and JCPyV VP1 show that receptors are bound in
shallow grooves formed by VP1 loop structures on the outer
surface of the virus. These loops contribute to different receptor
specificities and are the only parts of VP1 that are not well
conserved [14,15,16,17,18].
In this study, we use viral infection assays to demonstrate that
the b-series gangliosides GD3, GD2, GD1b and GT1b enhance
BKPyV infection. We then define the common a2,8-disialic acid
motif on these gangliosides as the primary binding epitope for
BKPyV by NMR spectroscopy. In order to understand how the
disialic acid motif is recognized by the virus, we solved the
crystal structure of a BKPyV VP1 pentamer in complex with
GD3 and generated a model of the pentamer with the larger
GD1b oligosaccharide. Analysis of these complexes reveals
extensive interaction with the terminal sialic acid, specificity￾defining contacts with the internal sialic acid, thus explaining the
requirement for a disialic acid motif, and additional contacts
with the branched GD1b. Mutagenesis of residues contacting
the disialic acid motif abolishes infectivity and a comparison
with the SV40 VP1-GM1 complex attributes the different viral
receptor specificities to one point mutation. Introduction of this
mutation into BKPyV switches specificity, enabling BKPyV to
bind GM1 and abolishes binding to GD3, as shown by
saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy and
carbohydrate microarray analyses. The microarray analyses
moreover reveal that the mutant is specific for the ‘human’ sialic
acid NeuNAc. This contrasts with SV40 VP1, which has a
preference for the more prevalent NeuNGc found in simian
species and many other nonhuman mammals. The specificity of
the mutant thus sheds light on the influence of sialic acid on
species tropism.
Results
All b-series gangliosides support infection of BKPyV
To date, only four gangliosides had been tested to support
BKPyV infection, two of which, the b-series gangliosides GD1b
and GT1b, were confirmed as receptors [11]. The carbohydrate
moieties of gangliosides typically consist of two ‘‘arms’’ (Fig. 1A).
In this manuscript, we number the carbohydrates sequentially
(starting from the lipid anchor) and use ‘‘L’’ and ‘‘R’’ designations
to indicate whether a carbohydrate is part of the left or the right
arm, respectively. For example, NeuNAc 3R is the third
carbohydrate and located in the right arm (Fig. 1A, schematic
on the left hand side). The right arm consists of only sialic acids
and is used to classify gangliosides. The b-series gangliosides, e.g.
GD1b and GT1b, carry both NeuNAc 3R and NeuNAc 4R, while
a-series gangliosides such as GM1 carry only NeuNAc 3R
(Fig. 1A). We tested the effects of all common b-series gangliosides
on BKPyV infection by supplementing permissive Vero cells
with GD3, GD2, GD1b or GT1b (Fig. 1B). Consistent with
previous reports [11], gangliosides GD1b and GT1b enhanced
infectivity of Vero cells. However, gangliosides GD2 and GD3,
which had not been tested previously, also enhanced infection of
the cells (Fig. 1B). Incorporation of all b-series gangliosides into
the plasma membrane of Vero cells increased the binding of
labeled VP1 pentamers to cells (data not shown). In control
experiments, supplementing cells with the a-series ganglioside
GM1 had no effect on infection or binding (Fig. 1B, and data
not shown). The ability of b-series gangliosides to enhance
BKPyV infection was greater in the presence of the left arm,
with GD1b and GT1b supporting infection best (Fig. 1B). Taken
together, these data show that the a2,8-disialic acid motif in b￾series gangliosides is the minimal requirement for binding, with
the left arm of GD1b and GT1b contributing some additional
interactions.
BKPyV carbohydrate epitope mapping on b-series
gangliosides
We analyzed pentamer binding to GD3 and GD1b oligosac￾charides by STD NMR spectroscopy [19], which identifies ligand
atoms that contact a protein in solution. The strongest saturation
transfer from BKPyV VP1 to GD3 was observed for the methyl
group of the terminal NeuNAc 4R, followed by the methyl group
of the internal NeuNAc 3R (Fig. 1C). No significant transfer was
observed to any of the anomeric protons, or to the NeuNAc H3
protons. Interestingly, no transfer was observed for the Glc and
Gal residues of GD3 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that they may not
participate in binding.
We repeated the same experiment for GD1b oligosaccharide,
observing transfer to essentially the same set of protons from the
disialyl moiety plus additional transfer to Gal 4L and GalNAc 3L
in the GD1b left arm as well as the branching Gal 2 residue
(Fig. 1D). Resonances H4 and H1 from Gal 2 and H1 from
GalNAc 3L can be unambiguously assigned, but H3 from Gal 2
and H4 from GalNAc 3L overlap and cannot be distinguished.
From the Gal 4L ring, only the anomeric proton can be assigned
in the STD difference spectrum. The STD spectra thus show that
while the right arms of both GD3 and GD1b interact with BKPyV
VP1 in a similar way, additional contacts are provided by the left
arm of GD1b.
Structure of a BKPyV VP1-GD3 complex
To define the structural features underlying the receptor￾binding specificity of BKPyV, we solved the structure of the
BKPyV VP1 pentamer at 2.0 A˚ resolution (Table 1). The VP1
pentamer is a doughnut-shaped ring, with the five monomers
arranged around a central pore that aligns with the five-fold
symmetry axis (Fig. 2A). The monomers adopt a b-sandwich fold
with jelly-roll topology that is present in many viral capsid
proteins. The b-strands B, I, D, G and C, H, E, F (designated
alphabetically from the N-terminus of the full-length protein) are
linked by extensive loops that decorate the surface of the protein.
For clarity, the long BC-loop is subdivided into loops BC1 and
BC2, which face in different directions.
We incubated BKPyV VP1 crystals in 20 mM GD3 oligosac￾charide solution and solved the structure of the resulting complex
at 1.7 A˚ resolution (Table 1). Attempts to form a complex with
GD1b oligosaccharide by soaking or co-crystallization failed in
several crystal forms, likely because of the size of the GD1b
hexasaccharide. However, the GD3 structure encompasses the

minimal motif required for binding and provides a template for
understanding interactions with the larger GD1b oligosaccharide.
The structures of unliganded and liganded BKPyV VP1 are
virtually identical (r.m.s.d. of 0.4 A˚ for all atoms of one
monomer), indicating that GD3 binding does not induce a
conformational change in the protein. GD3 engages BKPyV VP1
at the top of the pentamer, which corresponds to the outer
surface of the virion (Fig. 2A, B). Contacts involve residues in the
BC1-, HI- and DE-loops of one monomer, as well as the BC2-
loop of the clockwise neighboring VP1 monomer (BC2cw) and
the DE-loop of the counterclockwise neighbor (DEccw). Four of
the five binding sites within one pentamer are occupied by ligand,
while one is inaccessible due to crystal packing. Two of the four
occupied binding sites, however, participate in crystal contacts.
As their conformations are influenced by these non-physiologic
interactions, they will not be considered further. The two
remaining GD3 oligosaccharides do not participate in crystal
contacts and assume an identical conformation, which therefore
should represent a physiologically relevant complex. In both
cases, only the terminal NeuNAc-a2,8-NeuNAc motif interacts
with BKPyV VP1, while the Gal-Glc moiety projects into
solution. This is in agreement with the STD NMR data that
showed little saturation transfer between BKPyV VP1 and the
Gal-Glc portion of GD3.
Contacts between BKPyV VP1 and GD3
The terminal NeuNAc 4R is the main contact of GD3 with
BKPyV VP1. In all four occupied binding sites on the BKPyV
VP1 pentamer, NeuNAc 4R adopts the same conformation and
makes identical interactions with the protein. The sialic acid

carboxylate group is recognized by two hydrogen bonds to the side
chains of S274 and T276 (Fig. 2C). Additional, water-mediated
hydrogen bonds are formed to the side chain of S273 and the
backbone of S274. The O4 hydroxyl group of NeuNAc 4R
interacts via water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the side chain
of N272, the backbone of G131, and the backbone nitrogen of
F75cw. The N-acetyl group makes a hydrogen bond to N272 and
a water-mediated hydrogen bond to R169cw. Its methyl group
inserts into a tight-fitting, hydrophobic pocket on BKPyV VP1
that is formed by four non-polar residues (L62, F65, F270 and
F75cw). Finally, the glycerol chain of NeuNAc lies in a shallow
groove and makes van der Waals contacts to the side chains of
P58, L62, L67, K68 and Q278. The glycerol chain also forms a
single hydrogen bond to the K68 backbone nitrogen. The
conformation of the NeuNAc 4R ring is stabilized by an
intramolecular hydrogen bond from the carboxylate group to
the O8 hydroxyl group.
The second sialic acid of GD3, NeuNAc 3R, has weaker
electron density and makes fewer contacts with the protein
(Fig. 2C). Its carboxylate group forms a salt bridge with the K68
side chain. The methyl group of its N-acetyl chain stacks against a
hydrophobic surface created by parts of the side chains of
H138ccw, S274 and T276. The prominent role of van der Waals
interactions with the methyl group mirrors the NMR results,
which feature prominent saturation transfer to the methyl groups
of both NeuNAcs (Fig. 1C).
Modelling of the BKPyV-GD1b interaction reveals
additional contacts
The BKV-GD3 complex structure enabled us to model the
interaction of BKV VP1 with the longer GD1b oligosaccharide,
using the tightly bound terminal NeuNAc 4R as an anchor. A
large number of possible GD1b oligosaccharide conformations
was calculated and superposed on the terminal NeuNAc 4R in the
BKV-GD3 complex structure. The oligosaccharide conformations
were filtered for presence of the specificity-defining contacts
between the protein and the internal NeuNAc 3R. The remaining
conformations could be classified into two groups: one in which
the left arm of GD1b pointed away from the protein, not engaging
in interactions, and one in which this arm made additional
contacts with BKV VP1. Some of the latter conformations were
then subjected to a final round of molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in explicit water. We found that the ‘left’ arm is
involved in several weaker interactions with amino acids P58, D59,
L67, K68, E81, and K83. A snapshot of the complex is shown in
(Fig. 2D,E). According to this model, the Gal 4L residue of GD1b
can adopt a position enabling hydrogen bonds between its 2- and
3-hydroxyl groups and the side chain of E81, as well as hydrogen
bonds between its 6-hydroxyl group and the side chain of K83 and
the backbone carbonyl of P58. Moreover, the left arm of GD1b is
supported by van der Waals interactions with the side chain of
L67, and there is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the
carboxylate group of the internal NeuNAc 3R and the N-acetyl
group of GalNAc 3L. The model is in accord with the observed
increase in BKV infection with increasing length of the left arm of
b-series gangliosides, and also with the STD NMR data that show
signals for some protons in the left arm.
Carbohydrate binding is crucial for BKPyV spread and
infectivity
To test the biological relevance of these interactions mutations
were introduced into an infectious clone of BKPyV. We first
probed the interaction with the tightly bound terminal NeuNAc
4R (Fig. 3A) with mutations designed to abolish carbohydrate
binding either by reducing the number of hydrogen bonds (S274A,
T276A, and S274A/T276A), eliminating van der Waals contacts
(F75V), or by introducing steric hindrance (L62W, F75W). Vero
cells were transfected with mutant or wild-type (WT) BKPyV
plasmid DNA. Viral gene expression was scored every 3 days over
a 22 day growth period. The first data point after transfection
indicated no difference between wild-type and the mutants in
terms of protein expression and localization (data not shown).
While WT BKPyV resulted in viral production that continued to
spread with time, all mutants that targeted the binding site for
terminal sialic acid did not propagate, highlighting the importance
of these interactions (Fig. 3B). We then targeted the binding site of
the internal NeuNAc 3R. Mutant H138A, in which a van der
Waals contact is removed from the second sialic acid, propagated
at a significantly reduced level compared to WT (Fig. 3B). We also
introduced the mutations in our recombinant pentamer construct.
Flow cytometry binding assays using WT and mutant pentamers
show that the mutants have greatly reduced cell binding (Fig. 3C),
suggesting that the loss of viral propagation is due to an
attachment defect. The structural integrity of mutant pentamers
was verified with circular dichroism spectroscopy, and their ability
to assemble into pentamers was confirmed with gel filtration (data
not shown). All the mutations were in the receptor binding site,
which is distant from the sites important for capsid assembly.
Thus, the mutations are very unlikely to cause defects in capsid
assembly.

Finally, we mutated residues in the putative binding site for the
left arm of b-series gangliosides (Fig. 3D). Again, we designed
mutations to either introduce steric hindrance (D59Y and L67W)
or to remove contacts (D59A, L67A and K83A). The mutations
that created steric hindrance significantly reduced BKPyV spread
in culture. The D59A mutation had no significant effect, but L67A
and K83A both reduced BKPyV growth. In addition, the E81A
mutant, which also removes a contact from the second arm, was
described in an earlier paper to have slightly reduced growth [20].
The mutations likely did not abolish growth altogether because
they still permit interactions with the primary contact, terminal
sialic acid. While the D59Y and L67 mutations might in theory
also interfere with primary sialic acid binding due to the branched
nature of GD1b, the K83A and E81A mutations certainly only
target the second arm. Thus, mutagenesis confirms our structural
model and highlights the importance of specific contacts with the
second arm of GD1b. Taken together, our biological data confirm
that the binding site for terminal sialic acid is indispensable for
viral infection, while peripheral interactions further enhance
binding and infection.
Structural basis of specificity
BKPyV is most closely related to SV40 and JCPyV, with amino
acid identity among their VP1 proteins as high as 74%.
Nevertheless, the three viruses recognize different sialic acid
containing receptors. BKPyV interacts with a2,8-linked b-series
gangliosides, while SV40 binds the branched a2,3-linked GM1
ganglioside [12] and JCPyV attaches to the linear a2,6-linked
sequence in LSTc [17].
In receptor complexes of all three viruses, the terminal sialic
acid engages in critical and highly conserved interactions that
anchor the ligand to VP1 (Fig. 4) [16,17]. Specificity for the three

from a small number of unique contacts outside the sialic acid
binding site. JCPyV recognizes an L-shaped conformation of the
LSTc oligosaccharide. The key residue that makes contacts to
both legs of this L-shaped glycan is N123 [17] (Fig.4C). BKPyV
(Fig. 4A) and SV40 (Fig. 4B) both have a glycine at the equivalent
position and thus cannot form similar contacts. BKPyV VP1
specificity for the a2,8-disialyl motif can be attributed to residues
K68 and H138, which form contacts with the internal NeuNAc
3R. These two residues are not conserved in SV40 or JCPyV, and
thus neither virus is able to specifically interact with a2,8-disialic
acid carrying glycans in the same manner [16,17]. Moreover,
none of the BKPyV residues contacting the left arm of gangliosides
are conserved in either SV40 or JCPyV. Although the SV40
receptor, GM1, resembles GD1b with an identical left arm,
BKPyV and SV40 VP1 bind the left arm at different sites on the
proteins (Fig. 4A,B). The two pockets recognize the left arm in
different ways. The GalNAc 3L methyl group of GM1 in the SV40
complex is bound at a similar position on VP1 as the NeuNAc 3R
methyl group in the BKPyV complex. BKPyV cannot bind the left
arm of GM1 in the orientation seen in the SV40 complex because
the binding site is blocked by the large side chain of K68, which
would lead to clashes with GalNAc (Fig. 4A,B). Apart from this
difference, BKPyV and SV40 VP1 share similar surface features at
the SV40 left arm binding site and display the same main chain
conformation in their surface loops. Thus, the inability of BKPyV
to bind to GM1 appears to be determined by the amino acid at
position 68.
A single point mutation enables BKPyV to recognize GM1
To validate the conclusions derived from the structural
comparisons, we introduced a K68S mutation into the BKPyV
VP1 pentamer expression construct. Purified K68S pentamers
were analyzed by STD NMR for binding to GD3 and GM1.
Unlike the WT BKPyV-GD3 pair, almost no saturation transfer
was observed for BKPyV K68S and GD3, indicating that the
mutation virtually abolished binding to the disialic acid motif of
GD3 (Fig. 5A). However, saturation transfer from BKPyV K68S

VP1 to GM1 was as efficient as for the SV40 VP1-GM1 pair,
which was included for comparison (Fig. 5B–D). This indicates
that the K68S mutation switches the binding preference of
BKPyV VP1 from GD3 to GM1. The STD NMR spectra of SV40
VP1 and BKPyV K68S VP1 with GM1 are almost indistinguish￾able, suggesting that GM1 engages in the same contacts with both
proteins. Saturation transfer is primarily observed to protons of the
NeuNAc 3R and Gal 4L rings. In addition, both the GalNAc and
the NeuNAc methyl groups in GM1 received considerable
saturation in the complexes, with the NeuNAc methyl group
being more affected. Our observations are in good agreement with
the crystal structure of the SV40 VP1-GM1 complex [16] and
demonstrate that a single amino acid mutation suffices for BKPyV
to adapt to the SV40 receptor.
BKPyV K68S mutant is specific for the human sialic acid
NeuNAc
BKPyV, JCPyV and SV40 differ in one aspect of their sialic
acid binding site. The cavity engaging the methyl group is tight￾fitting and lined with hydrophobic residues in BKPyV and JCPyV,
but significantly enlarged and partially hydrophilic in SV40
(Fig. 4A–C). This difference may reflect the different hosts of these
viruses, humans and simians, and the different types of sialic acids
characteristic for each host. While the most prominent sialic acid
in humans is NeuNAc, simians carry in addition to NeuNAc larger
amounts of N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NeuNGc), in which the
methyl group is replaced by the bigger and more hydrophilic
glycolyl (CH2-OH) group [9,21]. SV40 preferentially binds to
NeuNGc-GM1, and the glycolyl group likely engages polar
residues in the cavity [16,22]. By contrast, the smaller and more
hydrophobic cavity of BKPyV and JCPyV cannot accommodate
the glycolyl group in a similar manner, thus making BKPyV and
JCPyV specific for NeuNAc.
To assess their specificity for human-type and simian-type sialic
acids, the VP1 proteins of WT BKPyV, mutant BKPyV K68S,
and SV40 were analyzed using a focused ganglioside microarray
comprised of 21 ganglioside-related saccharide probes, which
included the b-series gangliosides as well as GM1 variants
NeuNAc-GM1 and NeuNGc-GM1 (Supplemental Table S1).
Microarray analyses revealed differing binding specificities of the
three VP1 proteins (Fig. 5E–G). With the WT BKPyV, the only
detectable binding was to the b-series ganglioside GD1b (position
16) and the signal intensity was relatively low. No binding to any
other b-series gangliosides GD3, GD2, GT1b or GQ1b was
detected, possibly due the lower binding avidity to these probes
compared to GD1b in the array (Fig. 5E). The BKPyV K68S
mutant showed barely detectable binding to GD1b, but highly
specific and strong binding to the two NeuNAc-GM1 probes
(positions 10 and 11), which differed only in the composition of
their lipid moieties (Fig. 5F). Interestingly, there was no binding to
the simian-type NeuNGc-GM1 probes, in contrast to SV40 VP1,
which showed preferential binding to the two NeuNGc-GM1
probes (positions 12 and 13) (Fig. 5G). This finding is in accord
with earlier observations and consistent with our structural analysis
(Fig. 4).
BKPyV K68S uses NeuNAc-GM1 as a receptor on human
cells
We next tested whether BKPyV K68S was able to use human￾type NeuNAc-GM1 to attach to cells. Purified K68S or WT
BKPyV VP1 pentamers were incubated with simian (Vero) and
human (HEK) cells, and binding was detected by flow cytometry.
In both Vero and HEK cells, K68S mutant pentamers had
reduced binding compared to WT pentamers, reflecting either
lower affinity or a lower number of receptor molecules (Fig. 6A,C).
There was no significant change in the binding of K68S or WT
VP1 pentamers to Vero cells that were supplemented with 3 mM
NeuNAc-GM1 prior to incubation with the pentamers (Fig. 6A).
However, binding of K68S VP1 to HEK cells was increased upon
supplementation with GM1, whereas WT binding levels were
unchanged (Fig. 6C). This finding might be linked to the enzyme
CMP-sialic acid hydroxylase, which converts NeuNAc to NeuNGc
and is present on simian but not human cells [9]. We performed a
competitive binding assay with GM1 treated HEK cells in the
presence and absence of Cholera toxin subunit B (CTX), which
uses GM1 as a receptor [23]. CTX abolished binding of K68S
VP1, confirming that the K68S mutant is in fact retargeted to
GM1 (Fig. 6C). CTX had no effect on the binding of WT BKPyV
VP1 (Fig. 6C).
The K68S mutation was also assayed in long-term viral growth
assays. We found that while transfection of WT BKPyV plasmid
into Vero cells resulted in viral propagation and spread,
transfection with the K68S plasmid failed to propagate (Fig. 6B).
In human cells however the K68S mutant spread as efficiently as
WT regardless of supplementation with GM1 (Fig. 6D).
Discussion
In this structure-function study, we investigated the interaction
of BKPyV with its glycan receptors and identified key determi￾nants of specificity. We show that the conserved a2,8-disialic acid
motif on the right arm of b-series gangliosides is the minimal
binding epitope for BKPyV, with the variable left arm contrib￾uting some additional contacts. Point mutations in the receptor
binding site abolish viral spread and infectivity, demonstrating the
physiological relevance of the observed interactions.
Our data demonstrate that all of the b-series gangliosides tested
support BKPyV infection. As attachment likely requires multiple
interactions, the virus is predicted to engage a mixture of
gangliosides on the cell surface, depending on lipid composition.
While gangliosides are likely entry receptors for BKPyV, the main
binding epitope of BKPyV, a2,8-disialic acid, is not only present
on gangliosides, but also on glycoproteins. It has been shown for
another ganglioside-binding polyomavirus that such sialylated
glycoproteins act as decoy receptors [24]. The additional contacts
with the left arm of b-series gangliosides therefore may increase
BKPyV binding affinity for ganglioside ligands and distinguish
those from glycoproteins, which likely would lead the virus along
non-infectious entry pathways.
The importance of b-series gangliosides for BKPyV infection
may have implications for BKPyV tropism and pathogenesis.
Biochemical analyses indicate that the kidney, where BKPyV
persists, is rich in diverse sphingolipids and particularly gangli￾osides. The most abundant gangliosides in adult human kidney
are GM3 and GD3, but small amounts of more complex
gangliosides were also detected [25,26]. The relative abundance
of simple gangliosides differs between the kidney and the brain,
where complex gangliosides are most abundant in adults [27].
Therefore, the differences in affinity toward b-series gangliosides
are only one determinant of their usage as receptors in vivo, as a
lower affinity can be balanced by a greater abundance in the host
tissue. Moreover, gangliosides are differentially expressed in
cortical tubular, medullary and glomerular tissues of adult human
kidney and developmental changes in ganglioside expression
have been observed in bovine kidney [26]. Thus, our observation
of differing affinities toward b-series gangliosides raises the
question whether developmental or drug-induced changes in

ganglioside distribution may play a role in BKPyV latency and
reactivation.
Structural comparison of BKPyV-GD3 with the closely related
SV40-GM1 complex suggested that a protruding lysine at position
68 may prevent BKPyV from binding GM1. To test this
hypothesis, we introduced the smaller SV40 residue S68 into
BKPyV VP1. This single mutation switched the oligosaccharide
specificity of BKPyV from b-series gangliosides to GM1, altering a
key attachment property of BKPyV. Known BKPyV VP1
sequences contain lysine, arginine or histidine at position 68. All
of these amino acids would block engagement of GM1 but
promote or at least tolerate binding of b-series gangliosides.
BKPyV strains do not carry a serine at position 68, and this may
indicate that recognition of GM1 instead of b-series gangliosides
may not be advantageous to the virus in the context of the host
organism. Possible explanations could be that GM1 is not very
abundant or is differentially localized in human kidneys [25,26].
There likely exists an evolutionary constraint on BKPyV to bind b￾series gangliosides, not GM1, especially as the remainder of the
SV40 GM1 binding site is mostly conserved in BKPyV.
We have shown that unlike SV40, the BKPyV K68S mutant is
specific for GM1 containing the human sialic acid NeuNAc, and
cannot engage its simian counterpart NeuNGc due to steric
hindrance. As the WT BKPyV and K68S binding sites for
terminal sialic acid are identical, WT BKPyV shares the same
sialic acid specificity. The inability of K68S to propagate in simian
Vero cells and its ability to attach to and propagate in human
HEK cells highlights the importance of sialic acid specificity for
viral species tropism. Collectively, our data on BKPyV, JCPyV
and SV40 suggest that each virus has adapted to the most
prominent sialic acid in its host.
SV40, JCPyV and BKPyV all feature a conserved platform of
core residues that allows them to efficiently engage terminal sialic
acid in a similar manner. These core residues mediate the vast

majority of interactions. However, each virus achieves its distinct
receptor specificity with a small number of strategically positioned
satellite residues, such as K68 in the case of BKPyV, that form
distinct contacts with additional carbohydrate moieties. Thus,
these satellite residues define the context in which a terminal sialic
acid can be bound, and as demonstrated here they present
attractive opportunities for switching receptor specificities.
It is tempting to speculate that at least some members of the
polyomavirus family have evolved from an initial sialic-acid
binding template through subtle modification of their satellite
residues, thereby expanding their host range and tropism. The
switching of specificity can occur naturally in viruses, and often
triggers altered pathogenicity and species tropism. In many
cases, switching is due to exceedingly small changes in the virus
capsid structure. Prominent examples include different serotypes
of adenoviruses, the canine and feline parvoviruses, as well as
avian, swine and human influenza viruses [28,29,30]. In many of
these cases, however, the molecular functions of these switches,
such as how specific mutations alter the interaction with
receptors, are not well understood at the atomic level. Switching
polyomavirus receptor specificities, as demonstrated here in a
first example, may therefore be a useful tool to study parameters
that define host receptor recognition, viral uptake, and entry
pathways.
Materials and Methods
Virus infection
Cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37uC in
Cellgro Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) supplemented
with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals)
and penicillin (10,000 U/ml) and streptomycin (10,000 mg/ml)
(Gibco). Cells seeded in 24-well dishes were pre-incubated with
media, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or gangliosides GM1, GD2,
GD3, GD1b, and GT1b (Matreya) at 0.3–30 mM for 17 h at
37uC. Prior to infection cells were chilled for 20 min at 4uC and
washed with 2% MEM. Cells were infected with 86105
Fluorescent Forming Units (FFU) per ml of BKPyV for 1 h at
37uC. The infectious media was then removed and replaced with
fresh growth media. Infection was scored 72 h post infection by
staining for VP1 and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence.
Construction of the BKPyV pUC-19 expression plasmid was
previously described [20]. BKPyV VP1 mutants were generated
by site directed mutagenesis using QuickChange XL (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA). Mutant and WT plasmids were digested with
BamHI (Promega). Vero or HEK cells were transfected with
(0.5 mg) of linearized mutant or WT BKPyV plasmid DNA using
Fugene 6 (Roche).
Indirect immunofluorescence
To detect expression of viral antigens cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min
at 25uC and permeabilized with 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS for
15 min at 37uC. Cells were incubated with the primary mouse
monoclonal antibody PAb597 (1:10 [20], or PAb416 (Ab-2)
(0.2 mg/ml) (Calbiochem), [31], used at 8 ng/ml to stain for
BKPyV T-Ag. After incubation cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody
in PBS (Invitrogen).
Flow cytometry
Vero or HEK cells were incubated with media or 3 mM GM1
for 17–18 h. Cells were washed and suspended in 100 ml (10 mg/
mL) (Sigma) of CTX or PBS for 30 min on ice with 10 min
agitation. Cells were washed and then incubated with 100 ml of
purified wild type or mutant BKPyV VP1 pentamers (100 mg/mL)
in PBS on ice for 2 h with 30 min agitations or with PBS alone.
Cells were washed and suspended in 100 ml of Penta-His￾AlexaFlour 488 conjugated antibody (10 mg/mL) (Qiagen) in
PBS on ice for 1 h with 15 min agitations. Cells were washed and
fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and binding analyzed using a BD
FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Benton, Dickinson, and Compa￾ny). Data were analyzed using Flow Jo (Tree Star Inc.) software.
Recombinant protein expression and purification
We expressed and purified a truncated form of BKPyV VP1
that assembles into pentamers but does not form capsids. DNA
coding for amino acids 30–300 of BKPyV VP1 was amplified by
PCR and cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) in
frame with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (His-tag) and a
thrombin cleavage site. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli
BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography and gel
filtration on Superdex-200. For crystallization, the tag was cleaved
with thrombin before gel filtration, leaving non-native amino acids
GSHM at the N-terminus.
STD NMR measurements
All NMR spectra were recorded using 3 mm tubes on a Bruker
DRX 500 MHz spectrometer fitted with a 5 mm cryogenic probe
at 283 K and processed with TOPSPIN 2.0 (Bruker). For all
proteins used for STD NMR, two NMR samples were prepared,
containing either 1 mM GM1 oligosaccharide (Alexis) or 1 mM
GD3 oligosaccharide (Sigma). Protein concentrations were
between 19 mM and 22 mM. An additional sample contained
20 mM WT BKPyV VP1 and 1 mM GD1b oligosaccharide
(Elicityl, F). Additional protein-free samples were prepared that
only contained 1 mM GM1, GD3 or GD1b oligosaccharide.
These samples were used to verify that no direct excitation of
ligand resonances occurred during STD NMR measurements, and
they served as samples for the spectral assignment. 0.1 mM
trimethylsilyl propionate was then added to the GD3 sample to
allow 1
H referencing. The buffer used for all NMR measurements
contained 20 mM deutero-Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and
20 mM deutero-DTT. Samples were prepared in D2O and no
additional water suppression was used to avoid affecting the
anomeric proton signals. The off- and on-resonance frequencies
were set to 80 ppm and 7 ppm, respectively. The total relaxation
delay was 4 s. A cascade of 40 Gaussian-shaped pulses with 50 ms
duration each, corresponding to a strength of 65 Hz, and a
saturation time of 2 s was used for selective excitation. A 10 ms
continuous-wave spin lock filter with a strength of 3.7 kHz was
employed in order to suppress residual protein signals. 32 k points
were collected and zero filling to 64 k data points was employed.
Spectra were multiplied with an exponential line broadening
factor of 1 Hz prior to Fourier transformation.
To assign oligosaccharide proton resonances, series of 1D 1
H￾TOCSY and COSY spectra as well as 1
H, 13C-HSQC spectra
were acquired. Literature values for related oligosaccharides
served as additional assignment controls [32,33,34,35]. Assign￾ment of the acetate methyl groups was taken from [34] for GD3
and [32] for GM1.
Crystallization and structure determination
For crystallization, BKPyV VP1 was supplemented with 20 mM
DTT and concentrated to 6.6–7.0 mg/ml. The protein was
crystallized at 20uC by sitting drop vapor diffusion against a
reservoir of 16–18% PEG 3,350, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 and 0.25
M LiCl (drop size 300 nl protein+300 nl reservoir). Crystals were

harvested into reservoir solution containing 14–16% PEG 3,350
and cryoprotected by soaking in harvesting solution supplemented
with 30% (v/v) glycerol for 10 s before flash-freezing them in
liquid nitrogen. For oligosaccharide complex formation, crystals
were soaked in harvesting solution containing 20 mM GD3
oligosaccharide for 15 min before cryoprotection.
Diffraction data were collected at the SLS (Villigen, CH) and
processed with xds [36], and the structure was solved by molecular
replacement with Phaser [37] using the core of the SV40 VP1
pentamer (3BWQ) as the search model. After rigid body and
simulated annealing refinement in Phenix [38], missing parts of
the model were built in Coot [39]. Refinement proceeded by
alternating rounds of refinement in Refmac5 [40] and model
building in Coot. Fivefold non-crystallographic symmetry re￾straints were used throughout refinement. Oligosaccharide resi￾dues were located in weighted 2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc electron
density maps and refined with restraints from the CCP4
monomers library; only the a2,3- and a2,8- glycosidic linkages
had to be user-defined. Data collection and refinement statistics
are given in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factor amplitudes
were deposited with the RCSB data bank (www.rcsb.org) with
entry codes 4MJ0 (BKPyV VP1 bound to GD3) and 4MJ1
(unliganded BKPyV VP1). Structure figures were prepared with
PyMol (Schro¨dinger Inc.).
Molecular modeling
To generate a model for the complex, we first explored the
conformational space of GD1b alone using high-temperature
molecular dynamics (MD) [41] and subsequently positioned the
individual sampled snapshots into the binding site using the a2,8-
disialic acid motif of crystal structure as an anchor point.
Molecular dynamics simulation of GD1b was performed at 700
K for 100 ns using the MM3 force field as implemented in the
TINKER software (http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/). Torsion
restraints were applied on the ring torsions to avoid inversion of
the carbohydrate rings during MD. Snapshots were recorded
every 0.5 ps resulting in a conformational ensemble consisting of
200000 frames. Further processing of the data was performed
using Conformational Analysis Tools (CAT) (http://www.md￾simulations.de/CAT/). Conformational maps were calculated as
described [41] in order to check that the accessible conformational
space of the glycosidic linkages was sufficiently explored
(Supplemental Fig. S1). All snapshots were positioned into the
crystal structure using three atoms of residue NeuNAc 4R as an
anchor and conformations that result in atom-overlaps with the
protein were removed. Additionally two filters were applied on the
remaining snapshots that control the position and orientation of
residue NeuNAc 3R: Only snapshots were allowed to pass that
have the center of the carboxylate and the N-acetyl group within
3 A˚ of the corresponding residue of the crystal structure. Several
conformations were manually selected and refined based on 5 ns
MD simulations at 300K in explicit water using YASARA [42].
Model coordinates are available from the authors upon request.
Carbohydrate microarray analyses
Microarrays comprised lipid-linked oligosaccharide probes,
neoglycolipids (NGLs) and glycolipids, robotically printed on
nitrocellulose-coated glass slides using a non-contact instrument
[43,44]. For the analyses, an array set of 21 ganglioside-related
probes (18 sialylated and 3 non-sialylated, in house designation
Ganglioside Dose Response Array set 1) was used, in which each
probe was arrayed at four levels: 0.3, 0.8, 1.7 and 5.0 fmol/spot.
The microarray analyses were performed essentially as described
[17]. In brief, microarrays were blocked in 5 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.3% (v/v) Blocker Casein (Pierce),
0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 5 mM CaCl2
(referred to as HBS-Casein/BSA). WT and mutant BKPyV VP1
were diluted in HBS-Casein/BSA and overlaid at 300 mg/ml and
150 mg/ml, respectively, followed by incubation with mouse
monoclonal anti-poly-histidine and biotinylated antimouse IgG
antibodies (both from Sigma). SV40 VP1 was tested as a protein￾antibody complex that was prepared by preincubating with mouse
monoclonal anti-poly-histidine and biotinylated anti-mouse IgG
antibodies at a ratio of 4:2:1 (by weight) and diluted in HBS￾Casein/BSA to provide a final SV40 VP1 concentration of
150 mg/ml. The SV40 and K68S protein samples had been
supplemented with DTT to prevent dimerization of pentamers,
while WT BKPyV VP1 was analysed without DTT. Binding was
detected with Alexa Fluor-647-labelled streptavidin (Molecular
Probes). Microarray data analyses were as described [45].
