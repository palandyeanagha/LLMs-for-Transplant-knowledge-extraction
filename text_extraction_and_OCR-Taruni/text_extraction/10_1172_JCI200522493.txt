Nitrite represents a circulating and tissue storage form of NO whose bioactivation is mediated by the enzymat￾ic action of xanthine oxidoreductase, nonenzymatic disproportionation, and reduction by deoxyhemoglobin, 
myoglobin, and tissue heme proteins. Because the rate of NO generation from nitrite is linearly dependent on 
reductions in oxygen and pH levels, we hypothesized that nitrite would be reduced to NO in ischemic tissue and 
exert NO-dependent protective effects. Solutions of sodium nitrite were administered in the setting of hepatic 
and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. In hepatic I/R, nitrite exerted profound dose-depen￾dent protective effects on cellular necrosis and apoptosis, with highly significant protective effects observed at 
near-physiological nitrite concentrations. In myocardial I/R injury, nitrite reduced cardiac infarct size by 67%. 
Consistent with hypoxia-dependent nitrite bioactivation, nitrite was reduced to NO, S-nitrosothiols, N-nitros￾amines, and iron-nitrosylated heme proteins within 1–30 minutes of reperfusion. Nitrite-mediated protection of 
both the liver and the heart was dependent on NO generation and independent of eNOS and heme oxygenase-1 
enzyme activities. These results suggest that nitrite is a biological storage reserve of NO subserving a critical 
function in tissue protection from ischemic injury. These studies reveal an unexpected and novel therapy for 
diseases such as myocardial infarction, organ preservation and transplantation, and shock states.
Introduction
The anion nitrite (NO2
–) forms as a consequence of NO oxida￾tion and is present at concentrations of 0.3–1.0 μM in plasma and 
1–20 μM in tissue (1–5). This nitrite may be reduced to NO dur￾ing hypoxia and acidosis (1, 4–13). At very low tissue pH and oxy￾gen tension, nitrite may be reduced to NO by disproportionation 
(acidic reduction) (13) or by the enzymatic action of xanthine 
oxidoreductase (6, 7, 12, 13). However, within physiological rang￾es of pH and oxygen tension, nitrite has been considered an inert 
metabolic end product of NO oxidation with limited intrinsic 
biological activity (14). Challenging this dogma, we have recently 
demonstrated that near-physiological levels of nitrite are reduced 
to NO by reaction with deoxyhemoglobin along the physiological 
oxygen gradient, a chemical reaction whose rate is oxygen and pH 
dependent and that potentially contributes to hypoxic vasodila￾tion (8). We therefore hypothesized that hypoxia-dependent NO 
production from nitrite in ischemic tissue might limit ischemia￾reperfusion (I/R) injury.
Although reperfusion of ischemic tissues provides oxygen and 
metabolic substrates necessary for the recovery and survival of 
reversibly injured cells, reperfusion itself actually results in the 
acceleration of cellular necrosis (15). I/R is characterized by the 
formation of oxygen radicals upon reintroduction of molecular 
oxygen to ischemic tissues, resulting in widespread lipid and pro￾tein oxidative modifications, mitochondrial injury, and tissue 
apoptosis and necrosis (16). In addition, after reperfusion of isch￾emic tissues, blood flow may not return uniformly to all portions 
of the ischemic tissues, a phenomenon that has been termed the 
“no-reflow” phenomenon (17). Reductions in blood flow after 
reperfusion are thought to contribute to cellular injury and necro￾sis (17). The sudden re-introduction of blood into ischemic tissue 
also results in massive tissue disruption, enzyme release, reduc￾tions in high energy phosphate stores, mitochondrial injury, and 
necrosis (18, 19). Furthermore, previous studies have also indicat￾ed that the I/R injury is characterized by an inappropriate inflam￾matory response in the microcirculation, resulting in leukocyte–
endothelial cell interactions that are mediated by the upregulation 
of both leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules (20, 21). 
Intensive research efforts have been focused on the amelioration of 
various pathophysiological components of I/R injury to limit the 
extent of tissue injury and necrosis.
Nitric oxide, NO donors, and NO synthase activation or trans￾genic overexpression have been shown to exert protective effects 
on this process in a number of models (22–27) but in other mod￾els appear harmful (28–31). Evaluation of those studies suggests a 
critical effect of dose and duration of NO exposure, resulting in a

narrow therapeutic safety window for NO in I/R pathophysiology 
(32, 33). An additional limitation is that NO formation from NO 
synthase requires oxygen as substrate, a molecule whose availability 
becomes limited during ischemia. We therefore considered the use 
of nitrite in this context for the following reasons: (a) it is a natu￾rally occurring substance with no potentially toxic “leaving group”; 
(b) it is selectively reduced to NO in tissues with low oxygen tension 
and low pH (4, 6–13, 34, 35); and (c) NO is known to maintain 
heme proteins in a reduced and liganded state (36–38), to limit free 
iron– and heme-mediated oxidative chemistry (39–41), to tran￾siently inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial respiration 
(42–45), and to modulate apoptotic effectors (46), all mechanisms 
that might participate in cytotoxicity after severe ischemia.
To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of nitrite therapy 
compared with those of control therapy with vehicle or nitrate in 
well characterized in vivo murine models of hepatic and myocar￾dial I/R injury. We provide strong evidence for a profound pro￾tective effect of low concentrations of nitrite on cellular necrosis 
and apoptosis, mediated by a hypoxia-dependent bioconversion of 
nitrite to NO and nitrosated or nitrosylated proteins.
Results
Intraperitoneal nitrite limits hepatic I/R injury. Intraperitoneal deliv￾ery of 1.2–960 nmol sodium nitrite during hepatic ischemia 
limited serum elevations of the liver transaminases aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a 
dose-dependent way (Figure 1, A–C), with a peak effect occurring 
at a dose of 48 nmol nitrite. In sharp contrast, treatment with 
0.9% saline or sodium nitrate (48 nmol) did not exert any protec￾tive effects in the setting of hepatic I/R injury. Consistent with 
consumption of the intraperitoneal nitrite by the liver, plasma 
nitrite levels were not significantly elevated (baseline nitrite levels

mice treated with 48 nmol nitrite, the most effective dose.
Additional studies were performed for evaluation of the effects 
of nitrite treatment on hepatocellular injury in mice after in vivo 
hepatic ischemia (45 minutes) and more prolonged reperfusion 
(24 hours; Figure 1, D–I). The administration of 48 nmol nitrite 
significantly reduced hepatocellular injury at 24 hours of 
reperfusion compared with the administration of saline or nitrate. 
In addition, nitrite therapy significantly attenuated the extent of 
hepatocellular apoptosis after 45 minutes of hepatic ischemia 
and 24 hours of reperfusion (P < 0.001; Figure 1I). The extent of 
hepatic cell apoptosis in nitrite-treated animals subjected to I/R 
was similar to that observed in sham-operated control animals 
(P = NS). Consistent with this treatment having a U-shaped effi￾cacy profile, administration of 960 nmol nitrite to mice subjected 
to hepatic I/R injury failed to exert a significant protective effect 
(also evidenced by the transaminase profile in Figure 1, B and C).
Intraventricular nitrite limits myocardial I/R injury. To determine 
whether the potent cytoprotective effects of nitrite on liver I/R 
injury could be generalized to other organ systems, we next per￾formed studies to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effects 
of acute nitrite therapy in the setting of coronary artery occlu￾sion and reperfusion. The experimental protocol for the myo￾cardial I/R studies is depicted in Figure 2A. The administration 
of nitrite (48 nmol) into the left ventricular cavity at 5 minutes 
prior to reperfusion significantly limited myocardial infarct size 
(P < 0.001; Figure 2B) compared with the control treatment of 48 
nmol nitrate. Despite the results showing similar myocardial area 
at risk (AAR) (P = NS between groups; Figure 2C), nitrate treat￾ment decreased myocardial infarct size relative to the AAR and the 
left ventricle by 67% compared with nitrate-treated controls.
In additional groups of animals, we investigated the effects of 
various dosages of nitrite on myocardial infarct size after ischemia 
and reperfusion (Figure 2, C and D). Dosages of nitrite from 2.4

to 1,920 nmol were investigated. Data for myocardial AAR per 
left ventricle are presented in Figure 2C and clearly indicate that 
the AAR per left ventricle was similar in all study groups (P = NS 
between groups). We observed a dose-dependent decrease in myo￾cardial infarct size with a maximal protective effect at 48 nmol 
(Figure 2D). However, administration of 1,920 nmol of nitrite 
failed to exert any significant cardioprotective effect.
To establish the plasma concentrations of nitrite that were car￾dioprotective, in additional experiments we injected increasing 
amounts of nitrite into the left ventricular chamber and sacrificed 
the animals and measured the concentration of nitrite in blood 5 
minutes later. The plasma nitrite concentration correlated with 
the amount of nitrite injected (μM nitrite concentration in plas￾ma, 0.965 + 0.1971 × X + 0.0006815 × X2, where X = the amount 
of nitrite injected in nanomoles; n = 16; r = 0.96; P < 0.001). For 
the cardiac I/R experiments, the amounts injected and the mea￾sured concentrations in plasma were 0 nmol and 0.965 μM (basal 
plasma concentration of nitrite), 1.2 nmol and 1.2 μM, 2.4 nmol 
and 1.4 μM, 4.8 nmol and 1.9 μM, 48 nmol and 11.9 μM, 480 nmol 
and 252.6 μM, and 960 nmol and 818.3 μM. Consistent with the 
intravascular conversion of nitrite to NO (8), after the injection of 
48 nmol nitrite, a significant increase in iron-nitrosylated hemo￾globin was observed (Figure 2E).
We performed additional studies of myocardial I/R injury to 
determine possible mechanisms of nitrite-mediated cardiopro￾tection (Figure 2, F and G). Pretreatment with the NO scavenger 
2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) 
completely abolished the protective effects of nitrite therapy 
(Figure 2F). In contrast, treatment with the heme oxygenase-1 
(HO-1) inhibitor zinc (II) deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-bis-ethylene glycol 
(ZnDPBG) did not attenuate the cardioprotective actions of nitrite 
therapy in the ischemic-reperfused myocardium (Figure 2G).
Nitrite-mediated cytoprotection is associated with the reduction of nitrite 
to NO and formation of S-, N-, and heme-nitrosated or nitrosylated hepatic 
proteins. Consistent with previously described cellular reduction of 
nitrite to NO and S-nitrosothiols/N-nitrosamines (4, 8, 9, 34), 1 
minute after reperfusion the levels of nitrite in the livers of saline￾treated control mice subjected to ischemia decreased from 
1.75 μM to undetectable (P < 0.001 versus sham group) and 
levels of mercury-stable NO-modified proteins (representing 
N-nitrosamines and iron-nitrosyl proteins and collectively 
referred to here as RxNOs) increased to approximately 750 
nM (P < 0.001; Figure 3A). Interestingly, for nitrite treat￾ment compared with saline treatment, there was a signifi￾cant increase in liver levels of nitrite (P < 0.01 versus saline; Figure 
3B), S-nitrosothiols (Figure 3C), and RxNOs (Figure 3D) after 
reperfusion in the nitrite-treated mice.
These data suggest that nitrite is bioactivated during hypoxic 
stress and are consistent with our recent studies showing deoxy￾hemoglobin-dependent reduction of nitrite to NO (8), as well as 
recent studies by Bryan and colleagues demonstrating an acute 
conversion of tissue nitrite to mercury-labile NO-modified pro￾teins (RSNOs) and RxNOs after a systemic anoxic insult (4). The 
low levels of nitrite that are cytoprotective (1.2 nmol at the lowest 
dose; Figure 1, B and C) and the observed reductive decomposition 
of “native” liver nitrite in the saline-treated control animals (Fig￾ure 3A) suggest that this may be an innate mechanism for hypoxic 
NO production and cytoprotection.
Cytoprotective effects of nitrite are NO dependent but independent of NO 
synthase and HO-1 enzymatic activities. Further supporting the idea of 
a mechanism involving the hypoxic reduction of nitrite to NO, the 
NO inhibitor PTIO completely inhibited protective effects of nitrite 
in both heart (Figure 2F) and liver (Figure 4A). In contrast, nitrite 
remained cytoprotection in eNOS-deficient mice (P < 0.001; Figure 
4B), suggesting that NO production from nitrite during I/R is eNOS 
independent. We investigated the role of soluble guanylate cyclase 
(sGC) in nitrite-mediated protection against hepatic I/R injury 
(Figure 4C). Pretreatment with the sGC inhibitor [1H-[1,2,4]Oxa￾diazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one] (ODQ) completely inhibited the 
protective effects of nitrite in the setting of hepatic I/R injury.
Although HO-1 mRNA and protein are both significantly 
induced after hepatic I/R in this model, we did not observe any 
effects of nitrite treatment (48 nmol) on HO-1 mRNA or protein 
levels during I/R (Figure 4D). Furthermore, in mice pretreated with 
ZnDPBG, a specific and potent HO-1 inhibitor, nitrite significantly 
limited liver tissue injury, suggesting an HO-1–independent effect 
(P < 0.05; Figure 4E), similar to experimental results during car￾diac I/R (Figure 2G). Additional studies were performed utilizing 
HO-1–deficient (HO-1–/–) mice that were treated with nitrite and 
subjected to hepatic I/R injury for further evaluation of the role of 
HO-1 in nitrite-mediated cytoprotection. We observed robust pro￾Figure 3

tection against hepatic I/R injury in HO-1–/– mice treated with 48 
nmol nitrite (P < 0.01 versus the untreated HO-1–/– group; Figure 
4F), which further suggests that nitrite-induced protection does 
not involve HO-1 activation or signaling.
Discussion
In the present studies, nitrite treatment significantly increased the 
levels of liver nitrite and nitrosated or nitrosylated species (iron￾nitrosyl proteins, RSNO, and RXNO), compared with saline and 
nitrate control treatment, and conferred a substantial and unex￾pected dose-dependent cytoprotective effect, limiting necrosis and 
apoptosis and preserving organ function. Remarkably, a protective 
effect was observed with doses as low as 1.2 nmol nitrite, suggest￾ing that this may represent an endogenous protective mechanism 
that buffers severe metabolic or pathophysiological stress.
Recent data suggest that nitrite concentrations vary between 
blood and different organs and are typically in the high nanomo￾lar to low micromolar range. However, until recently, the high con￾centrations required to vasodilate aortic ring preparations led to 
its dismissal as an important biologically active molecule. Indeed, 
Furchgott et al. demonstrated in 1953 that 100 μM nitrite stimu￾lated vasodilation of aortic ring preparations, a process later shown 
to be mediated by activation of sGC (47–50). From a physiological 
standpoint, the in vivo conversion of nitrite to NO was thought 
to be limited to the stomach and severely ischemic heart, where 
acidic reduction or disproportionation at very low pH produces 
gastric mucosal vasodilation (5, 11, 51) and apparent cardiac tissue 
injury and heme iron-nitrosylation (at high nitrite concentrations 
in ischemic ex vivo heart preparations) (10), respectively. Although 
xanthine oxidoreductase–dependent nitrite reduction can occur at 
very low oxygen tensions and has recently been suggested to mediate 
nitrite-dependent cytoprotection in a Langendorff heart I/R model 
(52), NO production from this system is detectable only in the pres￾ence of high concentrations of superoxide dismutase (53, 54).
We recently reported that infusions of sodium nitrite into the 
human circulation produced significant vasodilation at both phar￾macological and near-physiological concentrations (8). The bioac￾tivation of nitrite appeared to be mediated by a nitrite reductase 
activity of deoxygenated hemoglobin, ultimately forming NO and 
iron-nitrosylated hemoglobin and, to a lesser extent, S-nitrosated 
protein species. Based on these data, a role for circulating nitrite 
in mediating hypoxic vasodilation was proposed, with the oxygen 
sensor in this case being hemoglobin (8). We hypothesize that a 
similar nitrite reductase activity of deoxyhemoglobin, deoxymyo￾globin, and/or other deoxygenated heme proteins may account for 
the formation of nitrosated or nitrosylated proteins and apparent 
NO-dependent cytoprotection observed during liver and cardiac 
ischemia in our study here. The contribution of this mechanism 
versus pathways involving xanthine oxido-reductase and acidic 
reduction will require further study.
The precise mechanism of how nitrite confers tissue protec￾tion remains unclear, although a critical and direct role for NO 
is implied from data shown in our work here. Previous studies of 
NO and I/R have yielded conflicting reports regarding the effects 
of NO on the severity of I/R injury, with some studies suggesting 
that NO actually contributed to reperfusion injury (30, 33). Our

laboratory has previously demonstrated that NO donors as well as 
the NO precursor L-arginine protect against myocardial I/R injury 
(22, 24, 55). More recently, we demonstrated that the severity of 
myocardial I/R injury is markedly exacerbated in mice completely 
deficient in eNOS (eNOS–/– mice) (55), whereas mice with eNOS 
overexpression are protected against myocardial infarction and 
subsequent congestive heart failure (25, 26, 56). Conflicting data 
on the effects of NO on I/R injury are probably related to the dose 
of NO and the conditions during ischemia and reperfusion (32). It 
is now well appreciated that very high, nonphysiological levels of 
NO (i.e., high micromolar and millimolar) actually promote cellu￾lar necrosis and apoptosis (57), while the demonstrated cytoprotec￾tive effects of NO typically involve nanomolar or low micromolar 
concentrations of NO (22, 23, 32). Additionally, studies investigat￾ing NO and NO-releasing agents under in vitro conditions of I/R 
have consistently reported deleterious effects of NO (32), in con￾trast to in vivo studies of I/R that have reported beneficial effects 
of NO therapy (22, 23). How NO mediates protection is also not 
clear, with multiple mechanisms being reported, including sGC 
activation, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and inhibition of 
deleterious mitochondrial calcium uptake (42–45).
Although these data suggest that the effects of nitrite occur 
secondary to NO formation, the ultimate mechanism of nitrite￾dependent cytoprotection is currently unknown. An intriguing 
possibility is the intermediate formation of S-nitrosothiols and 
N-nitrosamines, known to form via reactions of nitrite with deoxy￾hemoglobin and possibly tissue heme proteins (4, 8, 9, 35, 38, 58, 
59). Consistent with hypoxia-dependent formation of S-nitroso￾thiols in red blood cells and tissues from nitrite, hepatic levels of 
these species were significantly higher after reperfusion (1–30 min￾utes) in livers exposed to ischemia and nitrite. Within the relative 
reductive environment intracellularly, S-nitrosothiols formed via 
nitrite will be readily reduced to NO and activate sGC. Alternatively, 
S-nitrosation and subsequent effects on activity of critical proteins 
important in I/R-induced injury and apoptotic cell death may lead 
to protection (46). In addition, our data reveal a dynamic regula￾tion of hepatic RxNOs, a pool of mercury-stable NO-modified 
proteins that include N-nitrosamines and iron-nitrosyl proteins (4, 
50, 60), during I/R. In saline-treated groups, RxNO levels increased 
at 1 minute of reperfusion and then decreased after 30 minutes 
of reperfusion, whereas a sustained elevation in RxNO levels was 
observed in nitrite-treated mice, suggesting that the maintenance of 
RxNOs could be important in protecting tissues from I/R injury.
Finally, it is interesting that similar mechanisms might be at play 
in vivo and in isolated muscle during reductive meat-curing pro￾cedures. Nitrite has been utilized for curing meat for more than a 
century. During meat curing, the formation of iron-nitrosylated 
heme limits release of iron from the porphyrin molecule, prevents 
iron porphyrin– and metal ion–catalyzed lipid oxidation, Fenton 
chemistry, and ferryl heme formation (39–41, 61). Nitrite and NO 
produced from nitrite under hypoxic conditions can reduce fer￾ryl hemoglobin (36, 37) and catalyze ferriheme protein reductive 
nitrosylation (38), and nitrite can react with deoxyhemoglobin to 
form NO, iron-nitrosyl-heme, and S- and N-nitrosated intermedi￾ates (4, 8, 9, 34, 62). While it is clear that the formation of these 
reaction products in the mouse liver after I/R are associated with 
cytoprotection, more work will be needed to determine the exact 
mechanisms of nitrite-induced cytoprotection.
In conclusion, these data demonstrate a remarkable function for 
the relatively simple inorganic anion nitrite as a potent inhibitor 
of liver and cardiac I/R injury and infarction in the mouse. The 
effects of nitrite appear to be NO dependent, with a rapid con￾version of nitrite to NO and nitrosated or nitrosylated proteins 
after reperfusion. Given the known safety of nitrite as a naturally 
occurring anion and as an FDA-approved therapeutic for cyanide 
poisoning, these data evince a novel, safe, and inexpensive therapy 
for I/R injury. Such a therapy could be used to prevent or modu￾late organ dysfunction after coronary and peripheral vasculature 
reperfusion, high-risk abdominal surgery (such as aortic aneurism 
repair that leads to renal acute tubular necrosis), cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, and, perhaps most importantly, solid organ trans￾plantation. Further studies are required to establish the efficacy 
of nitrite in various organs and disease states.

Chemicals and reagents. Sodium nitrite (S-2252) and sodium nitrate (S-8170) 
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate were 
dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. In 
all experiments, a final volume of 50 μl containing 1.2–1,920 nmol sodium 
nitrite or sodium nitrate was administered to the mice. Carboxy-PTIO [2-(4-
carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium 
salt], a direct intravascular NO scavenger, was utilized to inhibit NO-depen￾dent effects after both hepatic and myocardial I/R injury. Carboxy-PTIO 
(Alexis Biochemicals) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and was 
administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg/kg in a volume of 50 μl 30 
minutes prior to either hepatic or myocardial ischemia. ZnDPBG (Alexis 
Biochemicals), an HO-1 inhibitor, was injected i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg 
in a volume of 50 μl 30 minutes prior to the induction of either hepatic 
or myocardial ischemia. ZnDBG has been shown previously to be a highly 
specific and potent inhibitor of HO-1 (63). The sGC inhibitor ODQ (Alexis 
Biochemicals) was utilized in experiments of hepatic I/R injury at a dose of 
20 mg/kg in a volume of 50 μl 30 minutes prior to hepatic ischemia.
Animals. All of the mice utilized in the present studies were C57BL6/J at 
8–10 weeks of age obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. In additional 
experiments of hepatic I/R injury we utilized eNOS–/– mice. The eNOS–/–
mice were originally generously donated by Paul Huang (Massachusetts 
General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and were generated in our 
breeding colony at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center. The 
eNOS–/– mice were utilized at 8–10 weeks of age. HO-1–/– mice were obtained 
from Shaw-Fang Yet (Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 
USA) and were utilized at 8–10 weeks of age.
Hepatic I/R protocol. The hepatic I/R protocol is depicted in Figure 1A 
and has been described previously (64, 65). Mice were anesthetized with 
a combination of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and zylazine (8 mg/kg). Both 
ketamine and zylazine were injected intraperitoneally into the mice prior 
to all surgical procedures. A midline laparotomy incision was performed 
to expose the liver. Mice were then injected with heparin (100 μg/kg, i.p.) 
to prevent blood clotting. The left lateral and median lobes of the liver 
were rendered ischemic by complete clamping of the hepatic artery and the 
portal vein using microaneurysm clamps. This experimental model results 
in a segmental (70%) hepatic ischemia. This method of partial ischemia 
prevents mesenteric venous congestion by allowing portal decompression 
throughout the right and caudate lobes of the liver. The liver was then 
repositioned in the peritoneal cavity in its original location for 45 minutes. 
The liver was kept moist with gauze soaked in 0.9% normal saline. In addi￾tion, body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a heat lamp and 
monitoring of body temperature with a rectal temperature probe. Sham 
surgeries were identical except that hepatic blood flow was not reduced 
with a microaneurysm clamp. The duration of hepatic ischemia was 45 
minutes in all experiments, after which the microaneurysm clamps were

removed. The duration of hepatic reperfusion was 5 hours in the studies 
of serum liver transaminase levels (i.e., AST or ALT) and 24 hours for the 
studies of liver histopathology (i.e., hepatocellular infarction).
Liver enzyme determinations. Serum samples were analyzed for AST and ALT 
using a spectrophotometric method (Sigma-Aldrich) (66). These enzymes 
are liver specific and are released from the liver during injury (64, 65).
Liver histopathology studies. Histopathology of liver tissue was performed as 
reported previously (64). Liver tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 
24 hours and was embedded in paraffin, and 10-μm sections were stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin. Histopathology scoring was performed on 
randomly selected high-power fields by investigators blinded to sample 
identity using the following criteria: 0, no hepatocellular damage; 1, mild 
injury characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization and focal nuclear pykno￾sis; 2, moderate injury with dilated sinusoids, cytosolic vacuolization, and 
blurring of intercellular borders; 3, moderate to severe injury with coagula￾tive necrosis, abundant sinusoidal dilation, red blood cell extravasation into 
hepatic chords, and hypereosinophilia and margination of neutrophils; 4, 
severe necrosis with loss of hepatic architecture, disintegration of hepatic 
chords, hemorrhage, and neutrophil infiltration.
Hepatocellular apoptosis was determined using a TUNEL staining 
kit from Roche Diagnostics Corp. according to the manufacturer’s rec￾ommendations. Briefly, liver tissue from various treatments was fixed 
in buffered formalin and 10-μm sections were prepared. Sections were 
permeablilzed on ice for 2 minutes and were incubated in 50 μl TUNEL 
solution for 30 minutes at 37°C. Sections were then treated with 50 μl 
substrate solution for 10 minutes and were mounted under glass cover 
slips. The number of apoptotic nuclei was determined from 5 randomly 
selected 40× fields per specimen. A total of 6 specimens per treatment 
group (16 slides per group) were analyzed and compared using 1-way 
ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-testing.
Myocardial I/R protocol. Surgical ligation of the left main coronary artery 
was performed similar to methods described previously (25). Briefly, mice 
were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and 
pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). The animals were then attached to a 
surgical board with their ventral side up. The mice were orally intubated 
with PE-90 polyethylene tubing connected to PE-240 tubing and then were 
connected to a Model 683 rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus). The tidal 
volume was set at 2.2 milliliters and the respiratory rate was set at 122 
breaths per minute. The mice were supplemented with 100% oxygen via 
the ventilator side port. A median sternotomy was performed using an 
electric cautery and the proximal left main coronary artery was visualized 
and completely ligated with 7-0 silk suture mounted on a tapered needle 
(BV-1; Ethicon). In the initial experiments of myocardial infarct size, coro￾nary occlusion was maintained for 30 minutes, followed by removal of the 
suture and reperfusion for 24 hours.
Myocardial infarct size determination. At 24 hours of reperfusion, the mice 
were anesthetized as described previously, intubated, and connected 
to a rodent ventilator. A catheter (PE-10 tubing) was placed in the com￾mon carotid artery to allow for Evans blue dye injection. A median ster￾notomy was performed and the left main coronary artery was re-ligated 
in the same location as before. Evans blue dye (1.2 ml of a 2.0% solution; 
Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the carotid artery catheter into the heart 
for delineation of the ischemic zone from the nonischemic zone. The 
heart was rapidly excised and serially sectioned along the short axis in 5 
1-mm-thick sections that were then incubated in 1.0% 2,3,5-triphenyltet￾razolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes at 37°C for demarcation 
of the viable and nonviable myocardium within the risk zone. Each of the 
5 1-mm-thick myocardial slices were weighed and the areas of infarction, 
AAR, and nonischemic left ventricle were assessed with computer-assisted 
planimetry (NIH Image 1.57) by an observer blinded to sample identity. All 
of the procedures for the left ventricular AAR and infarct size determina￾tion have been described previously (25).
HO-1 Western blot analysis. Liver tissue collected at 2,4, and 6 hours after 
I/R injury was homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer 
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and was centrifuged 3 times for 
30 minutes at 4°C; the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube after 
each centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio￾Rad reagents (BioRad Laboratories), and 50 μg total protein from each 
sample was loaded. Western blots were performed using mouse mAb to 
HO-1 (Stressgen) at a 1:3,000 dilution and goat anti-mouse secondary HRP 
conjugate at a 1:2,000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences).
Blood and tissue nitrite and nitrosated or nitrosylated protein and hemoglobin 
determination. The concentration of nitrite in plasma and the levels of iron￾nitrosylated hemoglobin were measured using tri-idodide–based reductive 
chemiluminescence as described and validated previously (67, 68). Liver tissue 
was homogenized using an amended protocol published by Bryan and col￾leagues (4). Harvested liver tissue was blotted dry on filter paper, weighed, and 
homogenized immediately in ice-cold buffer containing N-ethylmaleimide 
(10 mmol/l)/diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (2 mmol/l) (3:1 dilution, 
wt/vol). The buffer/tissue mixture was then homogenized with a Wheaton 
glass-on-glass homogenizer. Tissue homogenates were kept on ice and were 
analyzed within 5 minutes. The homogenate was subsequently injected 
directly into tri-iodine for measurement of the sum of nitrite, RxNOs, and 
RSNOs. For determining the levels of specific NO adducts (RxNOs and 
RSNOs), the sample was treated with and without 5 mM mercuric chloride 
(RSNO becomes nitrite in presence of mercuric chloride and RxNO is stable) 
and subsequently treated with acid sulfanilamide (0.5%) to eliminate nitrite.
Real-time PCR protocol. Total RNA from liver tissue was isolated using 
the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.) and the isolated RNA concentration was 
determined using a nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 
Technologies). The quality and integrity of total RNA was assessed on an 
Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Quantitative real-time PCR assays for HO-1 and 
GAPDH transcripts were carried out using gene-specific double-fluores￾cence–labeled probes in a 7900 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems). 
Probes and primers for HO-1 and GAPDH were obtained from Applied 
Biosystems as Assays On Demand gene expression products.
In brief, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA 
in a 20 μl reverse transcriptase reaction mixture with Invitrogen Corp.’s 
Superscript cDNA synthesis kit, following the manufacturer’s directions. 
PCR amplification was performed in a 384-well plate with a 20-μl reaction 
mixture containing 300 nm of forward and reverse primers, 200 nm probe, 
200 nm dNTP in 1× real-time PCR buffer, and passive reference (ROX) 
fluorochrome. The thermal cycling conditions were 2 minutes at 50°C and 
10 minutes at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds of denaturation at 
95°C and 1 minute of annealing and extension at 60°C. The comparative 
threshold (CT) PCR cycle detection method (∆∆ CT method) that compares 
the differences in CT values of control and treated groups was used to cal￾culate the relative fold change in gene expression between groups.
Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA with post-hoc 
Bonferroni analysis using StatView software version 5.0 (SAS Institute). 
Data are reported as mean ± SEM. P values less than 0.05 were consid￾ered significant.
