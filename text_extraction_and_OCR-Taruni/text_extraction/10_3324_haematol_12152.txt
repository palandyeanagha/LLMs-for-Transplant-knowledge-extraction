Brief Report
ABSTRACT
In daily clinical practice, the frequency of painful crises (pain rate) is an important parameter of sickle cell disease severity. We assessed
the prevalence of sickle cell disease-related organ damage and complications and their relation to pain rate. Organ damage and histo￾ry of vaso-occlusive complications were obtained via systematic screening of consecutive patients and by chart review. In 104 adult sick￾le cell patients pain rate was related to a history of acute chest syndromes, avascular osteonecrosis, iron overload, priapism and
cholelithiasis. However, major disease-related complications, such as microalbuminuria and pulmonary hypertension, were detected in
23% and 24% respectively of patients without painful crises in the study period underlining the importance of systematic screening for
developing organ damage in sickle cell patients irrespective of pain rate.
Key words: sickle cell disease, organ damage, pain rate, systematic screening.

Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is heterogeneous in its presenta￾tion, with differences in the rate and severity of complica￾tions even within a single genotype. Even patients with the
most severe genotype, HbSS, may vary in their clinical pres￾entation from being continuously admitted for the manage￾ment of acute complications to rarely requiring medical care.
Both vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis are major deter￾minants of SCD-related organ damage.1 With the increasing
life expectancy of sickle cell patients in the Western world the
effect of accumulating organ damage on the quality of life and
life expectancy is becoming an important factor in managing
SCD.2 Early recognition of developing organ damage is
imperative in order to institute specific therapeutics in a time￾ly manner. However, a landmark autopsy study in sickle cell
patients demonstrated a high prevalence of organ damage
that often had not been recognized during life by treating
phycisians.2 Although the frequency of the painful sickle cell
crisis, which is the hallmark SCD-related clinical complica￾tion, is considered a parameter of disease severity, most
patients do not frequently experience painful crises that
require medical care. Nonetheless, sickle cell patients general￾ly have a significantly reduced life expectancy suggesting that
clinically significant organ damage accumulates irrespective
of the pain rate.4 As the pain rate is considered an important
parameter of SCD severity, we analyzed whether the preva￾lence of SCD-related manifestations is related to the frequen￾cy of painful crises.
Design and Methods
Patients
Adult sickle cell patients visiting the Department of
Haematology of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in
Amsterdam were considered eligible. After obtaining written
and informed consent, patients were screened for SCD-relat￾ed manifestations from July 2005 until December 2006. This
study was approved by the internal review board of the
AMC and carried out in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
The CURAMA study group is a collaborative effort studying sickle cell disease in the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands. Participating centers: The
Red Cross Blood Bank Foundation, Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles; The Antillean Institute for Health Research, Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, The
Department of Internal Medicine, Slotervaart Hospital, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; the Department of Vascular Medicine and the Department of
Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; the Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands;
the Department of Pathology, Groningen University Hospital, the Netherlands; the Department of Internal Medicine, the Laboratory of Clinical Thrombosis
and Hemostasis, and the Cardiovascular Research Institute, Academic Hospital Maastricht, the Netherlands.

SCD related manifestations
SCD-related manifestations were assessed by system￾atic screening and medical record review and defined as
follows: microalbuminuria: urinary creatinine (mmol/L) to
urinary albumin (mg/L) ratio >3.5 (males)/>2.5 (females)
confirmed with 24 hours urine collection with microal￾buminuria >30 mg/24 hours.5 Renal failure: creatinine
clearance <100 mL/min (Cockcroft and Gault).6,7
Pulmonary hypertension (PHT): tricuspid regurgitation jet
flow velocity (TRV) ≥2.5 m/sec in rest detected by
Doppler echocardiography. PHT was considered absent
with no or only trace TRV.8 Retinopathy: presence of at
least mild non-proliferative retinopathy.
9 Perceptive
hearing loss: loss of >20 dB with no other explanation
than SCD.10 Cholelithiasis: presence of gallstones (ultra￾sound) or previous cholecystectomy because of chole￾cystolithiasis. Iron overload: plasma ferritin level >1000
µmol/L (on at least three occasions during steady state)
and a history of >20 transfused packed cells.11 Acute chest
syndrome: defined as previously described12 occurring
between January 2002-January 2007. Symptomatic avas￾cular osteonecrosis: local pain and reduced function with
documented osteonecrosis of the femoral or humeral
head (hip or shoulder X-ray) or a history of surgical
intervention for osteonecrosis. Leg ulcers: chronic ulcers
of the ankle not otherwise explained. Priapism: sponta￾neous painful erection requiring hospital care. Stroke:
history of stroke confirmed by magnetic resonance
imaging or computerized tomography. 
Pain rate
Pain rate was assessed by calculating the cumulative
number of admissions for painful crises (defined as typ￾ical musculo-skeletal/abdominal pain not otherwise
explained)4 from January 2002 until January 2007 and
categorizing patients into 3 groups: 0 crises/year, >0 and
<1 crises/year or ≥1 crises/year. Painful crises not requir￾ing medical care were excluded.
Laboratory parameters
All laboratory data were obtained during routine out￾patient visits at least four weeks after the last acute dis￾ease-related complication or blood transfusion. Fetal
hemoglobin percentage (HbF%) was determined by
cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatogra￾phy,13 and α-thalassemia screening was performed with
a multiplex PCR assay.

Statistical analysis
The most severe SCD genotypes (HbSS and HbSβ0
-
thalassemia) were grouped together, as were the rela￾tively severe genotypes (HbSC and HbSβ+
-thalassemia).
Continuous data are presented as medians with their
corresponding interquartile range. Between group dif￾ferences were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test.
Categorical data are presented as percentages with
between group differences or statistical dependence
tested with Fishers’ Exact Test. Bivariate correlations of
ordinal data were tested by determining the Spearman
correlation coefficient (rs). p values below 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. SPSS 12.0.2 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used. 
Results and Discussion
One hundred and ten adult sickle cell patients were
eligible of whom 6 were excluded due to incomplete
data collection (Table 1). Apart from retinopathy (which
was more prevalent in HbSC/HbSβ+
-thalassemia
patients), most manifestations of SCD were significant￾ly more often present in HbSS/HbSβ0
-thalassemia
patients. PHT was detected in 32% and 12% of the
HbSS-HbSβ0 and HbSC/HbSβ+ respectively, with a
median TRV of 2.60 (2.50-2.69) m/sec. None of these
patients had severe PHT (TRV>3.0 m/sec.). Although
significantly more patients with frequent sickle cell
crises used hydroxyurea, no difference in SCD-related
organ damage was observed between patients with or
without hydroxyurea (data not shown). 
Avascular osteonecrosis, a history of acute chest syn￾drome, priapism and cholelithiasis, as well as iron over￾load were significantly related to pain rate (Table 2). The
association between iron overload and the pain rate is
probably the result of liberal blood transfusions for
treating painful crises prior to instituting evidence-based
management protocols for SCD in the Netherlands.15
Importantly, microalbuminuria and PHT were detected

in 23% and 24% respectively of patients without
painful crises during the study period. Furthermore,
PHT and microalbuminuria were detected in 23% and
10% respectively of patients with no painful crises in
the last five years. These patients had no leg ulcers,
episodes of priapism or acute chest syndrome in the last
five years and appeared clinically well according to case
history and physical examination. Such patients would
probably have been misclassified as having mild SCD.
These data indicate that several major disease related
complications6,10 are not related to pain rate and occur
even in a significant number of patients that seem clini￾cally well. This underlines the importance of systemat￾ic screening for SCD-related complications even in clin￾ically mildly affected patients. 
Several shortcomings of this study need to be
addressed. Firstly, the history of acute painful crises was
limited to the last five years and only painful crises for
which patients were admitted were evaluated.
Therefore, the conclusions may not be extrapolated for
the number of painful crises experienced at home or
before the evaluated five year period. Secondly, the ret￾rospective nature of this study has probably resulted in
a selection bias. Thirdly, since this study was performed
in a tertiary teaching hospital, referral bias cannot be
excluded. However, given the similar prevalence of
most SCD-related disease manifestations in our cohort
to that reported in literature4,8,16-23 the study seems to be
representative. The prevalence of renal failure may,
however, be underestimated as supranormal proximal
tubular function characteristic of SCD probably results
in an overestimation of glomerular filtration.24 Also, the
prevalence of retinopathy in our study is higher than
that of previous reports which is probably due to the
inclusion of mild non-proliferative retinopathy.25 Lastly,
other forms of sickle cell-related organ damage, such as
pulmonary, hepatic and neurocognitive organ damage,
have not been analyzed in this study. Nonetheless, we
feel that the aforementioned factors do not influence
the main findings of our study.
In conclusion, clinically relevant forms of organ dam￾age, such as PHT and micro-albuminuria, occur irre￾spective of the frequency of painful crises in adults with
SCD. Systematic screening for and evaluation of organ
damage in all sickle cell patients seems indicated since
many of the sickle cell-related complications may other￾wise go unnoticed, thereby delaying the institution of
potential therapeutic measures.
